Forster was intensely focused on more than a century ago in a short story called, rightly enough, “The Machine Stops,” about a human civilization connected entirely through machines that one day just turn off.</p><p>这是一个问题，即福斯特在一个多个世纪前的一个叫做，正确的故事中的一个叫做，正确的“机器停止”，“机器停止”，这是一个完全通过机器连接的人类文明，即一天只关掉。</p><p>  Those fears of downtime are not just science fiction anymore. Outages aren’t just missing a must-watch TikTok clip. Hospitals, law enforcement, the government, every corporation — the entire spectrum of human institutions that constitute civilization now deeply rely on connectivity to function.</p><p>  那些对停机时间的恐惧不仅仅是科幻小说了。中断不仅仅是缺少必备的tiktok剪辑。医院，执法，政府，每个公司 - 构成文明的整个人类机构现在深深依靠与运作的连通性。</p><p> So when it comes to disaster response, the world has dramatically changed. In decades past, the singular focus could be roughly summarized as rescue and mitigation — save who you can while trying to limit the scale of destruction. Today though, the highest priority is by necessity internet access, not just for citizens, but increasingly for the on-the-ground first responders who need bandwidth to protect themselves, keep abreast of their mission objectives, and have real-time ground truth on where dangers lurk and where help is needed.</p><p> 因此，当涉及灾害反应时，世界已经大幅改变。几十年来，奇异的重点可以粗略地概括为救援和缓解 - 拯救你在试图限制破坏规模的同时可以拯救谁。尽管如此，最优先考虑是必需的互联网访问，而不仅仅是公民，而且越来越多地为需要带宽来保护自己，并及时了解他们的使命目标，并有实时地面真相。危险潜伏在哪里，需要帮助。</p><p> While  the sales cycles might be arduous as we learned in part one and  the data trickles have finally turned to streams in part two, the reality is that none of that matters if there isn’t connectivity to begin with. So in part three of this series on the future of technology and disaster response, we’re going to analyze the changing nature of bandwidth and connectivity and how they intersect with emergencies, taking a look at how telcos are creating resilience in their networks while defending against climate change, how first responders are integrating connectivity into their operations, and finally, exploring how new technologies like 5G and satellite internet will affect these critical activities.</p><p> 虽然销售周期可能是艰难的，但我们在第一个中学到，而数据涓涓细流最终转向第二部分，但现实情况是如果没有连接到以来，那么就不重要。因此，在本系列的第三部分上，在技术和灾害反应的未来，我们将分析带宽和连接的变化性质以及它们与紧急情况相交，看看Telco在捍卫时如何在网络中创造恢复力反对气候变化，第一响应者如何将连接性集成到其运营中，最后，探索了5G和卫星互联网这样的新技术将影响这些关键活动。</p><p>  Climate change is inducing more intense weather patterns all around the world, creating second- and third-order effects for industries that rely on environmental stability for operations. Few industries have to be as dynamic to the changing context as telecom companies, whose wired and wireless infrastructure is regularly buffeted by severe storms. Resiliency of these networks isn’t just needed for consumers — it’s absolutely necessary for the very responders trying to mitigate disasters and get the network back up in the first place.</p><p>  气候变化在世界各地诱导更强烈的天气模式，为依赖环境稳定的行业创造了第二次和三阶效应。少数行业必须是作为电信公司的变化背景，其有线和无线基础设施经常被严重风暴一起使用。消费者不仅需要这些网络的弹性 - 对于试图减轻灾害并首先让网络备份，这是绝对必要的。</p><p> Unsurprisingly, no issue looms larger for telcos than access to power — no juice, no bars. So all three of America’s major telcos — Verizon (which owns TechCrunch’s parent company Verizon Media,  although not for much longer), AT&amp;T and T-Mobile — have had to dramatically scale up their resiliency efforts in recent years to compensate both for the demand for wireless and the growing damage wrought by weather.</p><p> 不出所料，电台没有较大的问题，而不是电力 - 没有果汁，没有酒吧。因此，所有三个美国的主要电信 -  Verizon（拥有TechCrunch的母公司Verizon Media），＆amp; T和T-Mobile虽然不得不显着扩大他们的弹性努力，但弥补了这两种无线需求和天气造成的越来越多的损害。</p><p> Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at T-Mobile, said that the company has made resilience a key part of its network buildout in recent years, with investments in generators at cell towers that can be relied upon when the grid cannot. In “areas that have been hit by hurricanes or places that have fragile grids … that is where we have invested most of our fixed assets,” he said.</p><p> T-Mobile国家科技服务运营战略高级总监Jay Naillon表示，该公司近年来使网络建设的关键部分是其网络建设的关键部分，在电池塔上的发电机投资可以依赖于电网时不能。在“受飓风或有脆弱网格的地方被犯有的地区......那就是我们投资了大部分固定资产的地方，”他说。 </p><p> Like all three telcos, T-Mobile pre-deploys equipment in anticipation for disruptions. So when a hurricane begins to swirl in the Atlantic Ocean, the company will strategically fly in portable generators and mobile cell towers in anticipation of potential outages. “We look at storm forecasts for the year,” Naillon explained, and do “lots of preventative planning.” They also work with emergency managers and “run through various drills with them and respond and collaborate effectively with them” to determine which parts of the network are most at risk for damage in an emergency. Last year,  the company partnered with StormGeo to accurately predict weather events.</p><p>与所有三个电台一样，T-Mobile预先部署设备以进行中断。因此，当飓风开始在大西洋中旋转时，该公司将在预期潜在的中断的便携式发电机和移动蜂窝塔中战略上飞行。 “我们看一下这一年的风暴预测，”纳米隆解释道，并做了很多预防计划。“它们还与紧急经理和随着各种练习一起工作，并有效地响应和协作，以确定网络的哪些部分在紧急情况下造成损坏。去年，该公司与Stormgeo合作，准确预测了天气事件。</p><p> Predictive AI for disasters is also a critical need for AT&amp;T. Jason Porter, who leads public sector and the company’s FirstNet first-responder network, said that AT&amp;T teamed up with Argonne National Laboratory to create a climate-change analysis tool to evaluate the siting of its cell towers and how they will weather the next 30 years of “floods, hurricanes, droughts and wildfires.” “We redesigned our buildout … based on what our algorithms told us would come,” he said, and the company has been elevating vulnerable cell towers four to eight feet high on “stilts” to improve their resiliency to at least some weather events. That “gave ourselves some additional buffer.”</p><p> 灾害的预测AI也是AT＆amp的批判性需求。领导公共部门和公司的FirstNet第一响应网络的Jason Porter表示，在＆amp; T与Argonne National实验室联系起来，创建气候变化分析工具，以评估其细胞塔的选址以及它们将如何天气天气30年“洪水，飓风，干旱和野火”。 “我们重新设计了我们的建筑......根据我们的算法告诉我们会来的，”他说，并一直在将弱势群体塔提升四到八英尺高，以提高他们至少一些天气事件的弹性。 “给自己一些额外的缓冲区。”</p><p> AT&amp;T has also had to manage the growing complexity of creating reliability with the chaos of a climate-change-induced world. In recent years, “we quickly realized that many of our deployments were due to weather-related events,” and the company has been “very focused on expanding our generator coverage over the past few years,” Porter said. It’s also been very focused on building out its portable infrastructure. “We essentially deploy entire data centers on trucks so that we can stand up essentially a central office,” he said, empathizing that the company’s national disaster recovery team responded to thousands of events last year.</p><p> AT＆amp; T还必须使用气候变化诱导的世界的混乱来管理创造可靠性的日益复杂性。近年来，“我们迅速意识到我们的许多部署是由于与天气有关的事件，”公司已经“非常专注于在过去几年中扩大发电机覆盖”，“搬运工说。它也非常专注于构建其便携式基础设施。 “我们基本上在卡车上部署了整个数据中心，以便我们基本上是一个中央办公室，”他说，同情该公司的国家灾难恢复团队去年回应了数千次活动。</p><p> Particularly on its FirstNet service, AT&amp;T has pioneered two new technologies to try to get bandwidth to disaster-hit regions faster. First, it has invested in drones to offer wireless services from the sky. After Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana last year with record-setting winds, our “cell towers were twisted up like recycled aluminum cans … so we needed to deploy a sustainable solution,” Porter described.  So the company deployed what it dubs the FirstNet One — a “dirigible” that “can cover twice the cell coverage range of a cell tower on a truck, and it can stay up for literally weeks, refuel in less than an hour and go back up — so long-term, sustainable coverage,” he said.</p><p> 特别是在它的Firstnet服务，AT＆amp; T已经开创了两种新技术，以便更快地尝试将带宽带来带宽。首先，它投资了无人机，以提供天空的无线服务。劳拉去年飓风袭击了路易斯安那州，我们的“细胞塔被扭曲就像再生的铝罐......所以我们需要部署可持续解决方案”搬运工。因此，公司部署了它将其设计为FirstNet的内容 - 一个“可浮动的”，即“可覆盖卡车上的细胞塔的两次细胞覆盖范围，并且它可以留下来的几周，在不到一个小时内加油并回去起来 - 如此长期，可持续的覆盖范围，“他说。</p><p>  Secondly, the company has been building out  what it calls FirstNet MegaRange — a set of high-powered wireless equipment that it announced earlier this year that can deploy signals from miles away, say from a ship moored off a coast, to deliver reliable connectivity to first responders in the hardest-hit disaster zones.</p><p>  其次，公司一直在建立它呼叫FirstNet Megarange  - 这是一组高性能的无线设备，它今年早些时候宣布，可以从海岸停泊的船上部署信号，从船舶停泊的船舶，以提供可靠的连接最困难的灾区中的第一个响应者。</p><p> As the internet has absorbed more of daily life, the norms for network resilience have become ever more exacting. Small outages can disrupt not just a first responder, but a child taking virtual classes and a doctor conducting remote surgery. From fixed and portable generators to rapid-deployment mobile cell towers and dirigibles, telcos are investing major resources to keep their networks running continuously.</p><p> 随着互联网吸收了更多的日常生活，网络弹性的规范变得更加严峻。小型中断不仅可以扰乱第一个响应者，而是一个孩子正在进行虚拟课程和进行遥控手术的医生。从固定和便携式发电机到快速部署移动单元格塔和Dirigibles，电视机正在投资主要资源，以保持其网络连续运行。</p><p> Yet, these initiatives are ultimately costs borne by telcos increasingly confronting a world burning up. Across conversations with all three telcos and others in the disaster response space, there was a general sense that utilities just increasingly have to self-insulate themselves in a climate-changed world. For instance, cell towers need their own generators because — as we saw with Texas earlier this year — even the power grid itself can’t be guaranteed to be there. Critical applications need to have offline capabilities, since internet outages can’t always be prevented. The machine runs, but the machine stops, too.</p><p> 然而，这些举措最终由电话越来越面对燃烧的世界而成。在与灾害响应空间的所有三个电信和其他人的对话中，有一般意义的是，公用事业越来越多地在气候变化的世界中自我绝缘。例如，Cell Towers需要自己的发电机，因为 - 我们在今年早些时候与德克萨斯州看到的 - 即使是电网本身也不能保证在那里。关键应用程序需要具有离线功能，因为无法局部无法阻止互联网停机。机器运行，但机器也停止。 </p><p>  While we may rely on connectivity in our daily lives as consumers, disaster responders have been much more hesitant to fully transition to connected services. It is precisely in the middle of a tornado and the cell tower is down that you realize a printed map might have been nice to have. Paper, pens, compasses — the old staples of survival flicks remain just as important in the field today as they were decades ago.</p><p>虽然我们可能依赖于我们日常生活中的连通性，但灾难响应者对完全过渡到连通服务更为犹豫不决。正是在龙卷风中间，细胞塔下来，你意识到印刷地图可能很好。纸张，钢笔，指南针 - 旧钉的生存蝇仍然在本领域的重要内容在几十年前的情况下。</p><p> Yet, the power of software and connectivity to improve emergency response has forced a rethinking of field communications and how deeply technology is integrated on the ground. Data from the frontlines is extremely useful, and if it can be transmitted, dramatically improves the ability of operations planners to respond safely and efficiently.</p><p> 然而，为了提高应急响应的软件和连接的力量强迫了对现场通信的重新思考以及如何在地面上集成了深度的技术。来自前线的数据非常有用，如果可以传输，显着提高操作规划者安全有效响应的能力。</p><p> Both AT&amp;T and Verizon have made large investments in directly servicing the unique needs of the first responder community, with AT&amp;T in particular gaining prominence with its FirstNet network, which it exclusively operates through a public-private partnership with the Department of Commerce’s First Responder Network Authority. The government offered a special spectrum license to the FirstNet authority in Band 14 in exchange for the buildout of a responder-exclusive network, a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, which found that first responders couldn’t communicate with each other on the day of those deadly terrorist attacks. Now, Porter of AT&amp;T says that the company’s buildout is “90% complete” and is approaching 3 million square miles of coverage.</p><p> AT＆amp; T和Verizon都在直接为第一个响应者社区的独特需求提供了大量的投资，以＆amp; t at＆amp; T＆amp; t尤其是与其Firstnet网络的突出，它专门通过与商业部的公私合作伙伴关系第一个响应网络权限。政府向第14栏中的Firstnet权限提供了特殊的频谱许可，以换取响应者专属网络的建设，这是9/11委员会的关键建议，发现第一响应者无法互相通信那些致命的恐怖袭击的日子。现在，AT＆amp的搬运工说，公司的建筑是“90％完整”，正在接近300万平方英里的覆盖范围。</p><p>  Why so much attention on first responders? The telcos are investing here because in many ways, the first responders are on the frontiers of technology. They need edge computing, AI/ML rapid decision-making, the bandwidth and latency of 5G (which we will get to in a bit), high reliability, and in general, are fairly profitable customers to boot. In other words, what first responders need today are what consumers in general are going to want tomorrow.</p><p>  为什么对第一个受访者非常关注？电信技术在这里投资，因为在许多方面，第一个响应者都在技术前沿。他们需要边缘计算，AI / ML快速决策，5G的带宽和等待时间（我们将进入一点），高可靠性和一般，是相当有利可图的客户。换句话说，今天最初的响应者需要什么是消费者一般的是明天会想要的。</p><p> Cory Davis, director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon, explained that “more than ever, first responders are relying on technology to go out there and save lives.” His counterpart, Nick Nilan, who leads product management for the public sector, said that “when we became Verizon, it was really about voice [and] what’s changed over the last five [years] is the importance of data.” He brings attention to tools for situational awareness, mapping, and more that are a becoming standard in the field. Everything first responders do “comes back to the network — do you have the coverage where you need it, do you have the network access when something happens?”</p><p> Cory Davis是verizon公共安全战略和危机反应的主任，解释说，“比以往任何时候所述，第一名响应者都依靠技术来走出去，拯救生命。”他对公共部门提供产品管理的Nick Nilan表示，“当我们成为Verizon时，它真的关于声音[和]过去五年的变化是数据的重要性。”他提请注意态势意识，映射等工具，以及该领域的成为标准。首先响应者所做的一切“回到了网络 - 你有你需要的覆盖范围吗？你有什么时候有网络进入吗？”</p><p> The challenge for the telcos is that we  all want access to that network when catastrophe strikes, which is precisely when network resources are most scarce. The first responder trying to communicate with their team on the ground or their operations center is inevitably competing with a citizen letting friends know they are safe — or perhaps just watching the latest episode of a TV show in their vehicle as they are fleeing the evacuation zone.</p><p> 电信公司的挑战是，当灾难罢工时，我们都希望访问该网络，这正是当网络资源大多数稀缺时。第一个试图与他们的团队与他们的团队进行沟通的响应者或他们的运营中心不可避免地与一个公民竞争，让朋友知道他们是安全的 - 或者只是在逃离疏散区时观看电视节目的最新集。</p><p> That competition is the argument for a completely segmented network like FirstNet, which has its own dedicated spectrum with devices that can only be used by first responders. “With remote learning, remote work and general congestion,” Porter said, telcos and other bandwidth providers were overwhelmed with consumer demand. “Thankfully we saw through FirstNet … clearing that 20 MHz of spectrum for first responders” helped keep the lines clear for high-priority communications.</p><p> 该竞争是FirstNet的完全分段网络的论点，它具有自己的专用频谱，其具有仅可以由第一响应者使用的设备。 “通过远程学习，远程工作和一般拥堵，”Porter表示，电话和其他带宽提供者都被消费者需求所淹没。 “谢天谢地，我们通过FirstNet看到了第一个响应者的20 MHz的频谱”帮助保持了高优先级通信的线路。 </p><p> FirstNet’s big emphasis is on its dedicated spectrum, but that’s just one component of a larger strategy to give first responders always-on and ready access to wireless services. AT&amp;T and Verizon have made prioritization and preemption key operational components of their networks in recent years. Prioritization gives public safety users better access to the network, while preemption can include actively kicking off lower-priority consumers from the network to ensure first responders have immediate access.</p><p>FirstNet的重点是其专用频谱，但这只是一个较大策略的一个组成部分，以便首先给予响应者始终开启并准备访问无线服务。 AT＆amp; T和Verizon近年来提出了其网络的优先级和抢占按键运营组成部分。优先级排列提供公共安全用户更好地访问网络，而抢先可能包括积极地从网络上击落低优先级消费者，以确保第一响应者立即访问。</p><p> Nilan of Verizon said, “The network is built for everybody … but once we start thinking about who absolutely needs access to the network at a period of time, we prioritize our first responders.” Verizon has prioritization, preemption, and now virtual segmentation — “we separate their traffic from consumer traffic” so that first responders don’t have to compete if bandwidth is limited in the middle of a disaster. He noted that all three approaches have been enabled since 2018, and Verizon’s suite of bandwidth and software for first responders comes under  the newly christened Verizon Frontline brand that launched in March.</p><p> 韦兰的Veran说：“网络是为每个人建造的......但是一旦我们开始在一段时间内绝对需要访问网络，我们优先考虑我们的第一个受访者。” Verizon具有优先级，抢占和现在虚拟分割 - “我们将流量与消费者交通分开”，以便如果带宽在灾难的中间有限，第一响应者不必竞争。他指出，自2018年以来一直启用了所有三种方法，而Verizon的带宽和第一个受访者的软件套件是在3月推出的新克里凡尔登前线品牌下。</p><p> With increased bandwidth reliability, first responders are increasingly connected in ways that even a decade ago would have been unfathomable. Tablets, sensors, connected devices and tools — equipment that would have been manual are now increasingly digital.</p><p> 随着带宽可靠性的增加，首先响应者越来越多地以十年前的方式连接，即使十年前也是不可行的。平板电脑，传感器，连接的设备和工具 - 现在是手动的设备现在越来越多。</p><p> That opens up a wealth of possibilities now that the infrastructure is established. My interview subjects suggested applications as diverse as the decentralized coordination of response team movements through GPS and 5G; real-time updated maps that offer up-to-date risk analysis of how a disaster might progress; pathfinding for evacuees that’s updated as routes fluctuate; AI damage assessments even before the recovery process begins; and much, much more. In fact, when it comes to the ferment of the imagination, many of those possibilities will finally be realized in the coming years — when they have only ever been marketing-speak and technical promises in the past.</p><p> 现在建立了基础设施的大量可能性。我的面试主题建议申请多样化，因为响应小组通过GPS和5G的分散协调;实时更新的地图，提供最新的风险分析灾难如何进展;为疏散者进行更新的路线波动; AI损害评估甚至在恢复过程开始之前;还有更多。事实上，当涉及到想象力的发酵时，许多可能性最终会在未来几年内实现 - 当他们过去只有营销和技术承诺时。</p><p>  We’ve been hearing about 5G for years now, and  even 6G every once in a while just to cause reporters heart attacks, but what does 5G even mean in the context of disaster response? After years of speculation, we are finally starting to get answers.</p><p>  我们现在一直在听到5克，甚至每次6G只是为了引起记者心脏病发作，但在灾难反应的背景下，5G甚至意味着什么？经过多年的猜测，我们终于开始得到答案。</p><p> Naillon of T-Mobile noted that the biggest benefit of 5G is that it “allows us to have greater coverage” particularly given the low-band spectrum that the standard partially uses. That said, “As far as applications — we are not really there at that point from an emergency response perspective,” he said.</p><p> T-Mobile的Naillon指出，5G的最大益处是它“允许我们具有更大的覆盖”，特别是标准部分使用的低频频谱。那说，“就申请而言 - 我们并不是在那一点与紧急响应视角存在的那一点，”他说。</p><p> Meanwhile, Porter of AT&amp;T said that “the beauty of 5G that we have seen there is less about the speed and more about the latency.” Consumers have often seen marketing around voluminous bandwidths, but in the first-responder world, latency and edge computing tends to be the most desirable features. For instance, devices can relay video to each other on the frontlines, without necessarily needing a backhaul to the main wireless network. On-board processing of image data could allow for rapid decision-making in environments where seconds can be vital to the success of a mission.</p><p> 与此同时，AT＆amp的搬运工说“我们看到的5克的美丽较少，关于延迟的速度较少。”消费者经常看到庞大的带宽营销，但在第一响应者世界中，延迟和边缘计算往往是最理想的特征。例如，设备可以在前线上彼此中继视频，而不需要向主无线网络进行回程。图像数据的车载处理可以允许在秒的环境中快速决策，这对于使命的成功至关重要。 </p><p> That flexibility is allowing for many new applications in disaster response, and “we are seeing some amazing use cases coming out of our 5G deployments [and] we have launched some of our pilots with the [Department of Defense],” Porter said. He offered an example of “robotic dogs to go and do bomb dismantling or inspecting and recovery.”</p><p>这种灵活性允许在灾难响应中允许许多新的应用程序，并“我们看到了一些来自我们5G部署的一些惊人的用例[和]我们通过[防守部]推出了我们的一些飞行员，”Porter说。他提供了一个“机器人狗来去做炸弹拆除或检查和恢复”的一个例子。</p><p> Verizon has made innovating on new applications a strategic goal, launching a  5G First Responders Lab dedicated to guiding a new generation of startups to build at this crossroads. Nilan of Verizon said that the incubator has had more than 20 companies across four different cohorts, working on everything from virtual reality training environments to AR applications that allow firefighters to “see through walls.” His colleague Davis said that “artificial intelligence is going to continue to get better and better and better.”</p><p> verizon已经在新的应用程序上创新了一个战略目标，推出了一个5G第一响应者实验室，致力于指导新一代初创公司在这个十字路口建立。 verizon的Nilan表示，孵化器已经拥有四个不同的队列20多家公司，从虚拟现实培训环境中致力于允许消防员“通过墙壁看墙壁”的应用。他的同事戴维斯说，“人工智能将继续越来越好，更好。”</p><p> Blueforce is a company that went through the first cohort of the Lab. The company uses 5G to connect sensors and devices together to allow first responders to make the best decisions they can with the most up-to-date data. Michael Helfrich, founder and CEO, said that “because of these new networks … commanders are able to leave the vehicle and go into the field and get the same fidelity” of information that they normally would have to be in a command center to receive. He noted that in addition to classic user interfaces, the company is exploring other ways of presenting information to responders. “They don’t have to look at a screen anymore, and [we’re] exploring different cognitive models like audio, vibration and heads-up displays.”</p><p> Blueforce是一家经过第一个实验室的公司。该公司使用5G将传感器和设备连接在一起，允许第一个响应者以最新数据的最佳数据做出最佳决策。 Michael Helfrich，创始人兼首席执行官表示，“由于这些新网络......指挥官能够离开车辆并进入领域并获得与他们通常必须在命令中心的信息相同的保真度。他指出，除了经典的用户界面之外，该公司还探讨了向响应者呈现信息的其他方式。 “他们不必阅读屏幕了，而且[我们]探索不同的认知模型，如音频，振动和头部显示器。”</p><p> 5G will offer many new ways to improve emergency responses, but that doesn’t mean that our current 4G networks will just disappear. Davis said that many sensors in the field don’t need the kind of latency or bandwidth that 5G offers. “LTE is going to be around for many, many more years,” he said, pointing to the hardware and applications taking advantage of LTE-M standards for Internet of Things (IoT) devices as a key development for the future here.</p><p> 5G将提供许多新的方法来提高紧急响应，但这并不意味着我们目前的4G网络将无法消失。戴维斯说，该领域的许多传感器不需要5G优惠的延迟或带宽。 “LTE将在许多人身边，更多少年，”他说，指向利用LTE-M标准的硬件和应用程序，以便将互联网（IOT）设备作为未来的关键开发。</p><p>  Michael Martin of emergency response data platform  RapidSOS said that “it does feel like there is renewed energy to solve real problems,” in the disaster response market, which he dubbed the “Elon Musk effect.” And that effect definitely does exist when it comes to connectivity, where SpaceX’s satellite bandwidth project  Starlink comes into play.</p><p>  迈克尔马丁的紧急响应数据平台Rapidsos表示，“它确实感觉像在那里有能力解决真正的问题”，在灾难响应市场中，他称之为“伊龙麝香效应”。当涉及到连接时，这种效果肯定存在，其中SpaceX的卫星带宽项目Starlink发挥作用。</p><p> Satellite uplinks have historically had horrific latency and bandwidth constraints, making them difficult to use in disaster contexts. Furthermore, depending on the particular type of disaster, satellite uplinks can be astonishingly challenging to setup given the ground environment. Starlink promises to shatter all of those barriers — easier connections, fat pipes, low latencies and a global footprint that would be the envy of any first responder globally. Its network is still under active development, so it is difficult to foresee today precisely what its impact will be on the disaster response market, but it’s an offering to watch closely in the years ahead, because it has the potential to completely upend the way we respond to disasters this century if its promises pan out.</p><p> 卫星上行链路历史上有可怕的延迟和带宽约束，使得它们难以在灾难环境中使用。此外，根据特定类型的灾难，卫星上行链路可以令人惊讶地具有挑战性地在考虑到地面环境。 Starlink承诺破坏所有这些障碍 - 更容易连接，胖子，低延迟和全球足迹，这将是全球任何第一个响应者的羡慕。它的网络仍处于积极发展，因此难以提出预见到其影响将在灾害响应市场上进行哪些影响，但它是一个在未来几年密切关注的产品，因为它有可能完全颠覆我们的方式如果其承诺泛滥，本世纪遭遇灾害。</p><p> Yet, even if we discount Starlink, the change coming this decade in emergency response represents a complete revolution. The depth and resilience of connectivity is changing the equation for first responders from complete reliance on antiquated tools to an embrace of the future of digital computing. The machine is no longer stoppable.</p><p> 然而，即使我们折扣Starlink，即使在紧急响应中的这个十年的变化也是一个完整的革命。连接的深度和恢复性正在改变第一响应者的方程，从完全依赖于蒸发的工具到数字计算的未来的拥抱。机器不再停止。 </p><p>   Part 3: When the Earth is gone, at least the internet will still be working</p><p>第3部分：当地球消失时，至少互联网仍将运作 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/08/when-the-earth-is-gone-at-least-the-internet-will-still-be-working/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/消失/">#消失</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/internet/">#internet</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/网络/">#网络</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
