", "note_en": "The European Commission today said it has begun investigating Google for &#34;possible anticompetitive conduct&#34; in the market for online advertising technology.\n The  EC announcement said the formal antitrust investigation will &#34;assess whether Google has violated EU competition rules by favoring its own online display advertising technology services in the so-called &#39;ad tech&#39; supply chain, to the detriment of competing providers of advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers.&#34; The EC said it will &#34;examine whether Google is distorting competition by restricting access by third parties to user data for advertising purposes on websites and apps, while reserving such data for its own use.&#34;\n Chrome and Android figure into the investigation. The EC said it will investigate &#34;Google&#39;s announced plans to prohibit the placement of third-party &#39;cookies&#39; on Chrome and replace them with the &#39;Privacy Sandbox&#39; set of tools, including the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.&#34;\u00a0Google&#39;s Privacy Sandbox is also called FLoC, for Federated Learning of Cohorts.\n Regarding Android, the EC said it will examine &#34;Google&#39;s announced plans to stop making the advertising identifier available to third parties on Android smart mobile devices when a user opts out of personalized advertising, and the effects on online display advertising and online display advertising intermediation markets.&#34;\u00a0The EC said it will also probe Google-imposed requirements that force advertisers to use certain Google services in order to purchase ads on YouTube.\n  Noting that &#34;Google is present at almost all levels of the supply chain for online display advertising,&#34; EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the European government is &#34;concerned that Google has made it harder for rival online advertising services to compete in the so-called ad tech stack.&#34; Vestager is the EC&#39;s executive vice president in charge of competition policy.\n Vestager said the investigation will look into &#34;Google&#39;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition.&#34; She said that &#34;Google collects data to be used for targeted advertising purposes, it sells advertising space, and also acts as an online advertising intermediary.&#34;\n Google defended its practices in a statement sent to Ars and other news organizations. &#34;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day,&#34; Google said. &#34;They choose them because they&#39;re competitive and effective. We will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission to answer their questions and demonstrate the benefits of our products to European businesses and consumers.&#34;\n  FloC has been criticized by\u00a0 groups concerned about user privacy, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Rival browser makers don&#39;t like it, either, as Firefox maker Mozilla  told The Verge recently, &#34;We don&#39;t buy into the assumption that the industry needs billions of data points about people, that are collected and shared without their understanding, to serve relevant advertising.&#34; Browser maker Brave said that &#34;the worst aspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the guise of being privacy-friendly.&#34;\n Google has  said it developed the Privacy Sandbox in order to replace third-party cookies &#34;with viable privacy-first alternatives, developed alongside ecosystem partners, that will help publishers and advertisers succeed while also protecting people&#39;s privacy as they move across the web.&#34; Google  argues that its planned system is more protective of user privacy than current methods because it tracks groups of people instead of individual users.\n As we  wrote in January 2020, the planned system &#34;uses browser-based machine learning and other techniques to determine user interests and aggregate them with other users.&#34; Google could roll out the new system and drop Chrome support for tracking cookies  by 2022.\n We covered Google&#39;s planned Android change  earlier this month. It would start rolling out late in 2021 and, when users opt out of personalized ads, will show apps &#34;a string of zeros&#34; instead of the user&#39;s advertising ID.\n  The EC today said that &#34;Google provides several advertising technology services that intermediate between advertisers and publishers in order to display ads on websites or mobile apps&#34; and that the investigation will focus on display advertising. Besides the Chrome and Android portions mentioned earlier, the specific Google practices that the EC said it will investigate are as follows:\n The obligation to use Google&#39;s services Display &amp; Video 360 (&#39;DV360&#39;) and/or Google Ads to purchase online display advertisements on YouTube\n The obligation to use Google Ad Manager to serve online display advertisements on YouTube, and potential restrictions placed by Google on the way in which services competing with Google Ad Manager are able to serve online display advertisements on YouTube\n The apparent favoring of Google&#39;s ad exchange &#34;AdX&#34; by DV360 and/or Google Ads and the potential favoring of DV360 and/or Google Ads by AdX\n The restrictions placed by Google on the ability of third parties, such as advertisers, publishers or competing online display advertising intermediaries, to access data about user identity or user behavior which is available to Google&#39;s own advertising intermediation services, including the DoubleClick ID\n &#34;If proven, the practices under investigation may breach EU competition rules on anticompetitive agreements between companies,&#34; the announcement said.\n  The EC previously  fined Google $2.7 billion in 2017 for abusing its search dominance &#34;by  giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service&#34;;  $5.1 billion in 2018 for &#34; impos[ing] illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general Internet search&#34;; and  $1.69 billion in 2019 for &#34; imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites which prevented Google&#39;s rivals from placing their search adverts on these websites.&#34;\n The EC and Google have fought for years over Android&#39;s default search engine.

The Vision Fund poured capital into a host of companies with big plans, or what could at least be construed as grandiose hypotheses about the future. And after  deploying $98.6 billion in a blizzard of deals, SoftBank left the venture capital market changed.\n  It\u2019s not a stretch to say that the Vision Fund helped make the venture capital game faster in terms of deal pacing and larger in terms of deal scale. The Vision Fund was also content to write checks at amped valuations, leading some investors to privately carp about lost deals.\n Today\u2019s venture capital market is currently enduring another wave of venture capital angst, this time driven by Tiger Global. Tiger often writes smaller checks than what SoftBank\u2019s capital cannon wielded, but its pace and willingness to invest a lot, very early, at prices that other investors balk at,  is making waves.\n     And while Tiger races to build what increasingly appears to be a private index fund of software startups that have reached some sort of scale or growth, the venture capital market is seeing its traditional benchmarks tied to different tiers of investment molt, meld or disappear altogether.\n Old metrics that would ready a startup for a successful Series A are antiquated clich\u00e9s. As are  round sizes for  Series A startups; it\u2019s increasingly common for seed-stage startups to  reload their accounts several times before approaching an A, and Series B rounds often resemble the growth-stage deals of yesteryear.\n It\u2019s confusing, and not Tiger\u2019s fault, per se; the Tiger rush is a variation on the Vision Fund\u2019s own venture disruption. The Vision Fund followed in the footsteps of a16z, which raised  large, rapid funds early in its life and garnered a reputation at the time for having a willingness to pay more than other venture capital firms for the same deal.\n Where does all the change leave us? In a fascinating, if turbulent, market for startup fundraising.\n For example,  The Exchange caught up with  Rudina Seseri of  Glasswing Ventures the other week to chat about AI startups. During our conversation concerning venture capital dynamics, Seseri said something incredibly interesting: With as much seed capital as there is in the market today, she\u2019s seeing startups raise later Series As than before. But, she added, with the creep of late-stage capital into the earlier stages of venture investing, Series B rounds can happen rapidly after a company raises an A.\n So, slow As and fast Bs. We wanted to dig more into the concept, so we asked a number of other investors about her view. We\u2019re tackling the question in two parts, focusing on the U.S. market today and the rest of the world later this week.\n What we found out is that while Seseri\u2019s view regarding late As and early Bs is correct for many startups, it really depends on whether they are on the radar of later-stage firms. And yes, some of the investors mentioned Tiger in their responses.

It can also be reached from other browsers via  search.brave.com \u2014 so doesn\u2019t require switching to Brave\u2019s browser to use.\n Brave Search is being offered as one of multiple search options that users of the company\u2019s eponymous browser can pick from (including Google\u2019s search engine). But Brave says it will make it the default search in its browser later this year.\n  As we reported back in  March, the company acquired technology and developers who had previously worked on Cliqz, a European anti-tracking search-browser combo which closed down in  May 2020 \u2014 building on a technology they\u2019d started to develop, called Tailcat, to form the basis of the Brave-branded search engine.\n The (now beta) search engine has been tested by more than 100,000 \u201cearly access users\u201d at this point, per Brave. It\u2019s made this  video ad to tout its \u201call in one\u201d alternative to Google search + Chrome.\n The company recently passed 32M monthly active users (up from 25M back in March) for its wider suite of products \u2014 which, as well as its flagship pro-privacy browser, includes a news reader ( Brave News), and a  Firewall+VPN service.\n Brave also offers privacy-preserving  Brave Ads for businesses wanting to reach its community of privacy-preferring users.\n  Growing public awareness of surveillance based business models has been building momentum for pro-privacy consumer tech for a number of years. And several players which started out with a strong focus on one particular pro-privacy product (such as a browser, search engine or email) have been expanding into a full suite of products \u2014 all under the same non-tracking umbrella.\n As well as Brave, there\u2019s the likes of DuckDuckGo \u2014 which offers non-tracking search but also a tracker blocker and an email inbox protector tool, among other products, and reckons it now has  between 70M-100M users overall; and  Proton, the maker of e2e-encrypted email service ProtonMail but also a cloud calendar and file storage as well as a VPN. The latter recently confirmed  passing 50M users globally.\n There is also Apple itself too, of course \u2014 a Big Tech giant that competes with Google and the adtech complex by promising users a privacy premium to drive sales of its hardware and services. (At the  start of this year Apple said there are now over 1BN iOS users globally \u2014 and over 1.65BN Apple devices.)\n  Still, even Apple doesn\u2019t try to compete against Google search which perhaps underlines the scale of the challenge involved in trying to poach users from the search behemoth. (Albeit, Apple extracts  massive payments from Google to preload the latter\u2019s search engine onto iOS devices \u2014 which does conflict with (and complicate) its wider, pro-privacy, pro-user promises while also adding a nice revenue boost for Apple\u2026 ).\n DuckDuckGo has, by contrast, been at the non-tracking search coalface for years \u2014 and turning a profit since 2014. Though clearly not in the same profit league as Apple. But, more recently, it\u2019s also  taken in rare tranches of external funding  as its investors spy growing opportunity for private search.\n Other signs of expanding public appetite to protect people\u2019s information from commercial snoopers include the surge of usage for e2e encrypted alternatives to Facebook-owned WhatsApp \u2014  such as Signal \u2014 which saw a download spike earlier this year, after the advertising giant announced unilateral changes to WhatsApp\u2019s terms of service.\n Credible players that have amassed a community of engaged users around a core user privacy promise are well positioned to ride each new wave of privacy interest \u2014 and cross sell a suite of consumer products where they\u2019ve been able to expand their utility. Hence Brave believing the time is right for it to dabble in search.\n Commenting in a statement, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, said: \u201cBrave Search is the industry\u2019s most private search engine, as well as the only independent search engine, giving users the control and confidence they seek in alternatives to big tech. Unlike older search engines that track and profile users, and newer search engines that are mostly a skin on older engines and don\u2019t have their own indexes, Brave Search offers a new way to get relevant results with a community-powered index, while guaranteeing privacy. Brave Search fills a clear void in the market today as millions of people have lost trust in the surveillance economy and actively seek solutions to be in control of their data.\u201d\n  Brave touts its eponymous search offering as having a number of differentiating features vs rivals (including smaller rivals) \u2014 such as its own index which it also says gives it independence from other search providers.\n Why is having an independent index important? We put that question to Josep M. Pujol, chief of search at Brave, who told us: \u201cThere are plenty of incentives for censorship and biases, either by design, or what is even more difficult to combat, unintentional. The problem of search, and how people access the web, is that it is a mono-culture, and everybody knows that while it\u2019s very efficient, it\u2019s also very dangerous. A single disease can kill all the crops. The current landscape is not fail-tolerant, and this is something that even users are becoming aware of. We need more choices, not to replace Google or Bing, but to offer alternatives. More choices will entail more freedom and also get back to real competition, with checks and balances.\n \u201cChoice can only be achieved by being independent, as if we do not have our own index, then we are just a layer of paint on top of Google and Bing, unable to change much or anything in the results for users\u2019 queries. Not having your own index, as with certain search engines, gives the impression of choice, but in reality such engine \u2018skins\u2019 are the same players as the big-two. Only by building our own index, which is a costly proposition, will we be in a position to offer true choice to the users for the benefit of all, whether they are Brave Search users or not.\u201d\n Although, for now, it\u2019s worth noting that Brave is relying on some provision from other search providers \u2014 for specific queries and in areas like image search (where, for example, it says it\u2019s currently fetching results from Microsoft-owned Bing) \u2014 to ensure its results achieve adequate relevancy.\n Elsewhere it also says it\u2019s relying upon anonymized contributions from the community to improve and refine results \u2014 and is seeking to live up to wider transparency claims vis-a-vis the search index (which it also claims has \u201cno secret methods or algorithms to bias results\u201d; and for which it will \u201csoon\u201d be offering \u201c community-curated open ranking models to ensure diversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship\u201d).\n In another transparency step Brave is reporting the percentage of users\u2019 queries that are independent by showing what it bills as \u201cthe industry\u2019s first search independence metric\u201d \u2014 meaning it displays the ratio of results coming exclusively from its own index.\n \u201cIt is derived privately using the user\u2019s browser as we do not build user profiles,\u201d Brave notes in a press release. \u201cUsers can check this aggregate metric to verify the independence of their results and see how results are powered by our own index, or if third-parties are being used for long tail results while we are still in the process of building our index.\u201d\n It adds that Brave Search will \u201ctypically be answering most queries, reflected by a high independence metric\u201d. Although if you\u2019re performing an image search, for example, you\u2019ll see the the independence metric take a hit (but Brave confirms this will not result in any tracking of users).\n \u201c[ Transparency] is a key principle at Brave, and there will also be a global independence metric for Brave Search across all searches, which we will make publicly available to show how we are progressing towards complete independence,\u201d it adds.\n  On the monetization side, Brave says it will \u201csoon\u201d be offering both a paid ad-free version of search in the future and an ad-supported free version \u2014 while still pledging \u201cfully anonymous\u201d search. Though it specifies that it won\u2019t be flipping the ad switch during the early beta phase.\n \u201cWe will offer options for both ad-free paid search and ad-supported free search later,\u201d it notes. \u201cWhen we are ready, we will explore bringing private ads with BAT revenue share to search, as we\u2019ve done for Brave user ads.\u201d\n Users of the search engine who do not also use Brave\u2019s own browser will be served contextual ads.\n \u201cIn Brave Search via the browser, strong privacy guarantees for opt-in ads are a norm and a brand value that we uphold,\u201d adds Pujol, confirming that users of its search and browser are likely to get the same type of ad targeting.\n Asked about pricing of the forthcoming ad-free version of the search engine he says: \u201cAlthough we have not finalized the launch date or the price yet, our ad-free paid search will be affordable because we believe search, and access to information, should be available on fair terms for everyone.\u201d\n In an interesting  recent development in Europe, Google \u2014 under pressure from antitrust regulators \u2014 has agreed to ditch a pay-to-play auction model for the choice screen it offers regional users of its Android platform, letting them pick a default search engine from list with a number of rivals and its own brand Google search. The move should expand the number of alternative search engines Android users in Europe are exposed to \u2014 and could help chip away at some of Google\u2019s search marketshare.\n Brave previously told us it would not participate in Google\u2019s paid auction \u2014 but Pujol says that if the new model is \u201ctruly free to participate\u201d it will likely take part in future.\n \u201cGoogle and free-to-participate seem difficult to believe, given plenty of precedents but if this model is indeed truly free to participate, without contracts or non-disclosure agreements, then we would likely participate,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter all, Brave Search is open to everyone who would like to use it, and we are open and happy to put Brave Search on any platform.\u201d\n \u201cWe have localized browsers throughout the European market, so in addition to growth via the Brave browser growing, we intend to grow Brave Search\u2019s usage by marketing our best-in-class privacy on all media that reach prospective users,\u201d he adds.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 00:28:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce,tracking,\u641c\u7d22", "title": "\u52c7\u6562\u7684\u975e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u73b0\u5728\u5904\u4e8eBeta ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBrave\u2019s non-tracking search engine is now in beta\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/braves-non-tracking-search-engine-is-now-in-beta/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce", "tracking", "\u641c\u7d22"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ce7b1e33299f3615651ed2fa7bcdc957.jpg", "infoid": 1067486, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Vantage\u5f00\u59cb\u7126\u70b9\u8ba9AWS\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u6709\u70b9\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528 -

But as Vantage co-founder and CEO Ben Schaechter told me, it was the cost transparency features that really caught on with users.\n \u201cWe were advertising ourselves as being an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency,\u201d he said.\u201dWhat was interesting is \u2014 even in the early days of early access before the formal GA launch in January \u2014 I would say more than 95% of the feedback that we were getting from customers was entirely around the cost features that we had in Vantage.\u201d\n   Like any good startup, the Vantage team looked at this and decided to double down on these features and highlight them in its marketing, though it kept the existing AWS Console-related tools as well. The reason the other tools didn\u2019t quite take off, Schaechter believes, is because more and more, AWS users have become accustomed to infrastructure-as-code to do their own automatic provisioning. And with that, they spend a lot less time in the AWS Console anyway.\n \u201cBut one consistent thing \u2014 across the board \u2014 was that people were having a really, really hard time twelve times a year, where they would get a shock AWS bill and had to figure out what happened. What Vantage is doing today is providing a lot of value on the transparency front there,\u201d he said.\n Over the course of the last few months, the team added a number of new features to its cost transparency tools, including machine learning-driven predictions (both on the overall account level and service level) and the ability to share reports across teams.\n  While Vantage expects to add support for other clouds in the future, likely starting with Azure and then GCP, that\u2019s actually not what the team is focused on right now. Instead, Schaechter noted, the team plans to add support for bringing in data from third-party cloud services instead.\n \u201cThe number one line item for companies tends to be AWS, GCP, Azure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then, after that, it\u2019s Datadog Cloudflare Sumo Logic, things along those lines. Right now, there\u2019s no way to see, P&amp;L or an ROI from a cloud usage-based perspective. Vantage can be the tool where that\u2019s showing you essentially, all of your cloud costs in one space.\u201d\n That is likely the vision the investors bought in as well and even though Vantage is now going up against enterprise tools like Apptio\u2019s Cloudability and VMware\u2019s CloudHealth, Schaechter doesn\u2019t seem to be all that worried about the competition. He argues that these are tools that were born in a time when AWS had only a handful of services and only a few ways of interacting with those. He believes that Vantage, as a modern self-service platform, will have quite a few advantages over these older services.\n \u201cYou can get up and running in a few clicks. You don\u2019t have to talk to a sales team. We\u2019re helping a large number of startups at this stage all the way up to the enterprise, whereas Cloudability and Cloud Health are, in my mind, kind of antiquated enterprise offerings. No startup is choosing to use those at this point, as far as I know,\u201d he said.\n The team, which until now mostly consisted of Schaechter and his co-founder and CTO Brooke McKim, bootstrapped to company up to this point. Now they plan to use the new capital to build out its team (and the company is actively hiring right now), both on the development and go-to-market side.\n The company offers a  free starter plan for businesses that track up to $2,500 in monthly AWS cost, with paid plans starting at $30 per month for those who need to track larger accounts.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 00:27:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4f01\u4e1a,understand,\u56e2\u961f", "title": "Vantage\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684AWS\u6210\u672c ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tVantage raises $4M to help businesses understand their AWS costs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/vantage-raises-4m-to-help-businesses-understand-their-aws-costs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4f01\u4e1a", "\u56e2\u961f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5c7aa49db301e2e81f01d4511050d5dd.jpg", "infoid": 1067485, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7261\u86ce -

The company itself has seen business grow \u201cexponentially\u201d since then, said Tony Jamous, London-based Oyster\u2019s CEO who co-founded the company with Jack Mardack. The company now works with 80 large businesses, he said, helping them fill knowledge worker roles.\n  Stripes is leading the Series B, with previous backers Emergence Capital and The Slack Fund, as well as new investor Avid Ventures, also participating.\n Jamous  told me back in February that the idea for building Oyster was first planted when he was working at his first startup, Nexmo (which eventually he sold to Vonage), after being faced with the challenges of hiring talent internationally, and specifically the millions the company invested to build out the infrastructure to do so itself, since every country has very specific procedures for employing people and handling all of the contractural, tax, and regulatory details related to that.\n Oyster\u2019s mission has been to\u00a0 make it possible for any company to hire wherever they want, without going through that pain themselves, making the \u201cworld their oyster,\u201d so to speak.\n While that in itself is a great idea that definitely fills a need for businesses, it has also been compounded by recent changing tides. Not only are more people wanting to work further afield, but at \u201chome\u201d, many companies \u2014 especially those who need to fill knowledge worker roles \u2014 are facing talent shortages. All of this is driving even more demand for sourcing and hiring candidates from further afield, and a culture in the workplace that it\u2019s possible to work well even if you are not in the same physical space.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the world is that there\u2019s a talent shortage, and also there\u2019s no need to be in the office anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to tapping into the global talent pool, if you think about it, if you\u2019re a London-based company, then the chances that your best talent is in London is less than 1%. So by tapping into the global talent pool, suddenly you\u2019re dramatically increasing your chances, especially if you depend on talent as as a key source of your success.\u201d\n The number of startups in the market today targeting the remote working opportunity \u2014 helping companies source and hire people wherever they happen to be located \u2014 and Oyster is not the only one of them raising big money to scale. Others include Deel, which is  now valued at $1.25 billion;  Turing; Papaya Global (now also  valued at over $1 billion);  Remote, and many more.\n Oyster is not \u2014 yet? \u2014 in the business of helping to source or vet potential hires, but once someone is identified and an organization wants to make an offer, Oyster provides a seamless way to handle the rest, including giving advice on whether it\u2019s best to hire the person as a contractor or full time employee (the trend here, he said, is full-time), how to handle benefits based on the country in which the talent is based; and other aspects of remuneration, again particular to each local market. Pricing ranges from $29 per person, per month for contractors, to $399 for working with full employees, to other packages for larger deployments.\n The company also has a public service mission in all this. Jamous himself originally hails from Lebanon and has a particular mission to help people from less high-profile parts of the world, and emerging countries, also get on the career ladder. In this day and age, since relocation and migration are no longer a must-do, it opens up a lot of opportunities for people that didn\u2019t exist before. Oyster applied for, and now has B-Corp certification, which it\u2019s using to fill out that global employment and talent mandate.\n This is not just for greater good, though. There are actual talent shortages, and a recent study from Korn Ferry, cited by Oyster, found that 1.5 billion knowledge workers will be entering the workforce in the next decade from emerging economies. Building tools to help hire and manage that talent makes business sense.\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Stripes for the next chapter of growth and positive impact for Oyster,\u201d said Jack Mardack, co-Founder of Oyster, in a statement. \u201cInvestors like Stripes, Emergence, Slack Fund, Avid, and PeopleTech Partners among others, who share in our passion for the Oyster mission and vision for the future of work, give us the rocket fuel we need to change the world by unblocking access to job opportunities for everyone.\u201d\n \u201cThe transition to remote work is one of the most fundamental macro trends in business today and COVID-19 accelerated that transition by 10 years,\u201d said Saagar Kulkarni, partner at Stripes, in a statement. \u201cOyster makes it seamless for any company to hire the best person for each job, removing location as a barrier. Tony and the team have built the best software product in the market and are poised to build a market-defining company.

A new study of ancient geological events suggests that our planet has a slow, steady &#39;heartbeat&#39; of geological activity every 27 million years or so.\n This pulse of clustered geological events - including volcanic activity, mass extinctions, plate reorganizations and sea level rises - is incredibly slow, a 27.5-million-year cycle of catastrophic ebbs and flows. But luckily for us, the research team notes we have another 20 million years before the next &#39;pulse&#39;.\n &#34;Many geologists believe that geological events are random over time,&#34;  said Michael Rampino, a New York University geologist and the study&#39;s lead author.\n &#34;But our study provides statistical evidence for a common cycle, suggesting that these geologic events are correlated and not random.&#34;\n The team conducted new analysis on the ages of 89 well-understood geological events from the past 260 million years.\n As you can see from the graph below, some of those times were tough \u2013 with over eight of such world-changing events clustering together over geologically small timespans, forming the catastrophic &#39;pulse&#39;.\n  &#34;These events include times of marine and non-marine extinctions, major ocean-anoxic events, continental flood-basalt eruptions, sea-level fluctuations, global pulses of intraplate\u00a0magmatism, and times of changes in seafloor-spreading rates and plate reorganizations,&#34;  the team writes in their paper.\n &#34;Our results suggest that global geologic events are generally correlated, and seem to come in pulses with an underlying ~27.5-million-year cycle.&#34;\n   Geologists have been investigating a potential cycle in geological events for a long time. Back in the 1920s and 30s, scientists of the era had suggested that the geological record had a 30-million-year cycle, while in the 1980s and 90s researchers used the best-dated geological events at the time to give them a range of the length between &#39;pulses&#39; of 26.2 to 30.6 million years.\n Now, everything seems to be in order \u2013 27.5 million years is right about where we&#39;d expect. A\u00a0 study late last year by the same authors suggested that this 27.5-million-year mark is when mass extinctions happen, too.\n &#34;This paper is quite good, but actually I think a better paper on this phenomenon was [a 2018 paper by] Muller and Dutkiewicz,&#34; tectonic geologist Alan Collins from the University of Adelaide, who wasn&#39;t involved in this research, told ScienceAlert.\n That 2018 paper, by two researchers at the\u00a0 University of Sydney, looked at Earth&#39;s carbon cycle and plate tectonics, and also came to the conclusion that the cycle is approximately 26 million years long.\n Collins explained that in this latest study, many of the events the team looked at are causal - meaning that one directly causes the other, thus some of the 89 events are related: for example, anoxic events causing marine extinction.\n   &#34;Having said this,&#34; he added, &#34;this 26-30 million year cyclicity does seem to be real and over a longer period of time \u2013 it also is not clear what is the underlying cause of it!&#34;\n Other research from Rampino and his team have  suggested comet strikes\u00a0could be the cause, with one space researcher even suggesting  Planet X is to blame.\n But if Earth really does have a geologic &#39;heartbeat&#39;, it might be due to something a little closer to home.\n &#34;These cyclic pulses of tectonics and

", "note_en": "You might have come across  Judea Pearl&#39;s new book, and a  related interview which was widely shared in my social bubble. In the interview, Pearl dismisses most of what we do in ML as curve fitting. While I believe that&#39;s an overstatement (conveniently ignores RL for example), it&#39;s a nice reminder that most productive debates are often triggered by controversial or outright arrogant comments. Calling machine learning alchemy was a great recent example. After reading the article, I decided to look into his famous do-calculus and the topic causal inference once  again.\n Again, because this happened to me semi-periodically. I first learned do-calculus in a (very unpopular but advanced) undergraduate course Bayesian networks. Since then, I have re-encountered it every 2-3 years in various contexts, but somehow it never really struck a chord. I always just thought &#34;this stuff is difficult and/or impractical&#34; and eventually forgot about it and moved on. I never realized how fundamental this stuff was, until now.\n This time around, I think I fully grasped the significance of causal reasoning and I turned into a full-on believer. I know I&#39;m late to the game but I almost think it&#39;s basic hygiene for people working with data and conditional probabilities to understand the basics of this toolkit, and I feel embarrassed for completely ignoring this throughout my career.\n In this post I&#39;ll try to explain the basics, and convince you why you should think about this, too. If you work on deep learning, that&#39;s an even better reason to understand this. Pearl&#39;s comments may be unhelpful if interpreted as contrasting deep learning with causal inference. Rather, you should interpret it as highlighting causal inference as a huge, relatively underexplored, application of deep learning. Don&#39;t get discouraged by causal diagrams looking a lot like Bayesian networks (not a coincidence seeing they were both pioneered by Pearl) they don&#39;t compete with, they complement deep learning.\n  First of all, causal calculus differentiates between two types of conditional distributions one might want to estimate.  tldr: in ML we usually estimate only one of them, but in some applications we should actually try to or have to estimate the other one.\n To set things up, let&#39;s say we have i.i.d. data sampled from some joint $p(x,y,z,\\ldots)$. Let&#39;s assume we have lots of data and the best tools (say, deep networks) to fully estimate this joint distribution, or any property, conditional or marginal distribution thereof. In other words, let&#39;s assume $p$ is known and tractable. Say we are ultimately interested in how variable $y$ behaves given $x$. At a high level, one can ask this question in two ways:\n observational $p(y\\vert x)$: What is the distribution of $Y$ given that I  observe variable $X$ takes value $x$. This is what we usually estimate in supervised machine learning. It is a conditional distribution which can be calculated from $p(x,y,z,\\ldots)$ as a ratio of two of its marginals. $p(y\\vert x) = \\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)}$. We&#39;re all very familiar with this object and also know how to estimate this from data.\n interventional $p(y\\vert do(x))$: What is the distribution of $Y$ if I were to  set the value of $X$ to $x$. This describes the distribution of $Y$ I would observe if I intervened in the data generating process by artificially forcing the variable $X$ to take value $x$, but otherwise simulating the rest of the variables according to the original process that generated the data. (note that the data generating procedure is NOT the same as the joint distribution $p(x,y,z,\\ldots)$ and this is an important detail).\n  No. $p(y\\vert do(x))$ and $p(y\\vert x)$ are not generally the same, and you can verify this with several simple thought experiments. Say, $Y$ is the pressure in my espresso machine&#39;s boiler which ranges roughly between $0$ and $1.1$ bar depending on how long it&#39;s been turned on. Let $X$ be the reading of the built-in barometer. Let&#39;s say we jointly observe X and Y at random times. Assuming the barometer functions properly $p(y|x)$ should be a unimodal distribution centered around $x$, with randomness due to measurement noise. However, $p(y|do(x))$ won&#39;t actually depend on the value of $x$ and is generally the same as $p(y)$, the marginal distribution of boiler pressure. This is because artificially setting my barometer to a value (say, by moving the needle) won&#39;t actually cause the pressure in the tank to go up or down.\n In summary, $y$ and $x$ are correlated or statistically dependent and therefore seeing $x$ allows me to predict the value of $y$, but $y$ is not caused by $x$ so setting the value of $x$ won&#39;t effect the distribution of $y$. Hence, $p(y\\vert x)$ and $p(y\\vert do(x))$ behave very differently. This simple example is just the tip of the iceberg. The differences between interventional and observational conditionals can be a lot more nuanced and hard to characterize when there are lots of variables with complex interactions.\n  Depending on the application you want to solve, you should seek to estimate one of these conditionals. If your ultimate goal is diagnosis or forecasting (i.e. observing a naturally occurring $x$ and inferring the probable values of $y$) you want the observational conditional $p(y\\vert x)$. This is what we already do in supervised learning, this is what Judea Pearl called curve fitting. This is all good for a range of important applications such as classification, image segmentation, super-resolution, voice transcription, machine translation, and many more.\n In applications where you ultimately want to control or choose $x$ based on the conditional you estimated, you should seek to estimate $p(y\\vert do(x))$ instead. For example, if $x$ is a medical treatment and $y$ is the outcome, you are not merely interested in observing a naturally occurring treatment $x$ and predicting the outcome, we want to  proactively choose the treatment $x$ given our understanding of how it effects the outcome $y$. Similar situations occur in system identification, control and online recommender systems.\n  This is perhaps the main concept I haven&#39;t grasped before. $p(y\\vert do(x))$ is in fact a vanilla conditional distribution, but it&#39;s not computed based on $p(x,z,y,\\ldots)$, but a different joint $p_{do(X=x)}(x,z,y,\\ldots)$ instead. This $p_{do(X=x)}$ is the joint distribution of data which we would observe if we actually carried out the intervention in question. $p(y\\vert do(x))$ is the conditional distribution we would learn from data collected in  randomized controlled trials or A/B tests where the experimenter controls $x$. Note that actually carrying out the intervention or randomized trials may be impossible or at least impractical or unethical in many situations. You can&#39;t do an A/B test forcing half your subjects to smoke weed and the other half to smoke placebo to understand the effect on marijuana on their health. Even if you can&#39;t directly estimate $p(y\\vert do(x))$ from randomized experiments, the object still exists. The main point of causal inference and do-calculus is:\n If I cannot measure $p(y\\vert do(x))$ directly in a randomized controlled trial, can I estimate it based on data I observed outside of a controlled experiment?\n  Let&#39;s start with a diagram that shows what&#39;s going on if we only care about $p(y\\vert x)$, i.e. the simple supervised learning case:\n  Let&#39;s say we observe 3 variables, $x, z, y$, in this order. Data is sampled i.i.d. from some observable joint distribution over 3 variables, denoted by the blue factor graph labelled &#39;observable joint&#39;. If you don&#39;t know what a factor graph is, it&#39;s not important, the circles represent random variables, the little square represents a joint distribution of the variables it&#39;s connected to. We are interested in predicting $y$ from $x$, and say that $z$ is a third variable which we do not want to infer but we can also measure (I included this for completeness). The observational conditional $p(y\\vert x)$ is calculated from this joint via simple conditioning. From the training data we can build a model $q(y\\vert x;\\theta)$ to approximate this conditional, for example using a deep net minimizing cross-entropy or whatever.\n Now, what if we&#39;re actually interested in $p(y\\vert do(x))$ rather than $p(y\\vert x)$? This is what it looks like:\n  So, we still have the blue observed joint and data is still sampled from this joint. However, the object we wish to estimate is on the bottom right, the red intervention conditional $p(y\\vert do(x))$. This is related to the intervention joint which is denoted by the red factor graph above it. It&#39;s a joint distribution over the same domain as $p$ but it&#39;s a different distribution. If we could sample from this red distribution (e.g. actually run a randomized controlled trial where we get to pick $x$), the problem would be solved by simple supervised learning. We could generate data from the red joint, and estimate a model directly from there. However, we assume this is not possible, and all we have is data sampled from the blue joint. We have to see if we can somehow estimate the red conditional $p(y\\vert do(x))$ from the blue joint.\n  If we want to establish a connection between the blue and the red joints,  we must introduce additional assumptions about the causal structure of the data generating mechanism. The only way we can make predictions about how our distribution changes as a consequence of an interaction is if we know how the variables are causally related. This information about causal relationships is not captured in the joint distribution alone. We have to introduce something more expressive than that. Here is how what this looks like:\n  In addition to the observable joint we now also have a causal model of the world (top left) This causal model contains more detail than the joint distribution: it knows not only that pressure and barometer readings are dependent but also that pressure causes the barometer to go up and not the other way around. The arrows in this model correspond to the assumed direction of causation, and the absence of an arrow represents the absence of direct causal influence between variables. The mapping from causal diagrams to joint distributions is many-to-one: several causal diagrams are compatible with the same joint distribution. Thus, it is generally impossible to conclusively choose between different causal explanations by looking at observed data only.\n Coming up with a causal model is a modeling step where we have to consider assumptions about how the world works, what causes what. Once we have a causal diagram, we can emulate the effect of intervention by mutilating the causal network: deleting all edges that lead into nodes in a $do$ operator. This is shown on the middle-top panel. The mutilated causal model then gives rise to a joint distribution denoted by the green factor graph. This joint has a corresponding conditional distribution $\\tilde{p}(y\\vert do(x))$, which we can use as our approximation of $p(y\\vert do(x))$. If we got the causal structure qualitatively right (i.e. there are no missing nodes and we got the direction of arrows all correct), this approximation is exact and $\\tilde{p}(y\\vert do(x)) = p(y\\vert do(x))$. If our causal assumptions are wrong, the approximation may be bogus.\n Critically, to get to this green stuff, and thereby to establish the bridge between observational data and interventional distributions, we had to combine data with additional assumptions, prior knowledge if you wish. Data alone would not enable us to do this.\n  Now the question is, how can we say anything about the green conditional when we only have data from the blue distribution. We are in a better situation than before as we have the causal model relating the two. To cut a long story short, this is what the so-called  do-calculus is for. Do-calculus allows us to massage the green conditional distribution until we can express it in terms of various marginals, conditionals and expectations under the blue distribution. Do-calculus extends our toolkit of working with conditional probability distributions with four additional rules we can apply to conditional distributions with the $do$ operators in them. These rules take into account properties of the causal diagram. The details can&#39;t be compressed into a single blog post, but here is  an introductory paper on them..\n Ideally, as a result of a do-calculus derivation you end up with an equivalent formula for $\\tilde{p}(y\\vert do(x))$ which no longer has any do operators in them, so you estimate it from observational data alone. If this is the case we say that the causal query $\\tilde{p}(y\\vert do(x))$ is  identifiable. Conversely, if this is not possible, no matter how hard we try applying do-calculus, we call the causal query  non-identifiable, which means that we won&#39;t be able to estimate it from the data we have. The diagram below summarizes this causal inference machinery in its full glory.\n  The new panel called &#34;estimable formula&#34; shows the equivalent expression for $\\tilde{p}(y\\vert do(x))$ obtained as a result of the derivation including several do-calculus rules. Notice how the variable $z$ which is completely irrelevant if you only care about $p(y\\vert x)$ is now needed to perform causal inference. If we can&#39;t observe $z$ we can still do supervised learning, but we won&#39;t be able to answer causal inference queries $p(y\\vert do(x))$.\n  You can never fully verify the validity and completeness of your causal diagram based on observed data alone. However, there are certain aspects of the causal model which are empirically testable. In particular, the causal diagram implies certain conditional independence or dependence relationships between sets of variables. These dependencies or independencies can be empirically tested, and if they are not present in the data, that is an indication that your causal model is wrong. Taking this idea forward you can attempt to perform full causal discovery: attempting to infer the causal model or at least aspects of it, from empirical data.\n But the bottom line is: a full causal model is a form of prior knowledge that you have to add to your analysis in order to get answers to causal questions without actually carrying out interventions. Reasoning with data alone won&#39;t be able to give you this. Unlike priors in Bayesian analysis - which are a nice-to-have and can improve data-efficiency - causal diagrams in causal inference are a must-have. With a few exceptions, all you can do without them is running randomized controlled experiments.\n  Causal inference is indeed something fundamental. It allows us to answer &#34;what-if-we-did-x&#34; type questions that would normally require controlled experiments and explicit interventions to answer. And I haven&#39;t even touched on counterfactuals which are even more powerful.\n You can live without this in some cases. Often, you really just want to do normal inference. In other applications such as model-free RL, the ability to explicitly control certain variables may allow you to sidestep answering causal questions explicitly. But there are several situations, and very important applications, where causal inference offers the only method to solve the problem in a principled way.\n I wanted to emphasize again that this is not a question of whether you work on deep learning or causal inference. You can, and in many cases you should, do both. Causal inference and do-calculus allows you to understand a problem and establish what needs to be estimated from data based on your assumptions captured in a causal diagram. But once you&#39;ve done that, you still need powerful tools to actually estimate that thing from data. Here, you can still use deep learning, SGD, variational bounds, etc. It is this cross-section of deep learning applied to causal inference which the recent article with Pearl claimed was under-explored.\n UPDATE: In the comments below people actually pointed out some relevant papers (thanks!).

The SiFive Performance family debuts with two new processor cores, the P270, SiFive\u2019s first Linux capable processor with full support for the RISC-V vector extension v1.0 rc, and the SiFive Performance P550 core, SiFive\u2019s highest performance processor to date. The new SiFive Performance P550 delivers a SPECInt 2006 score of 8.65/GHz, making it the highest performance RISC-V processor available today, and comparable to existing proprietary solutions in the application processor space.\n \u201cSiFive Performance is a significant milestone in our commitment to deliver a complete, scalable portfolio of RISC-V cores to customers in all markets who are at the vanguard of SOC design and are dissatisfied with the status quo,\u201d said Dr. Yunsup Lee, Co-Founder and CTO of SiFive. \u201cThese two new products cover new performance points and a wide range of application areas, from efficient vector processors that easily displace yesterday\u2019s SIMD architectures, to the bleeding edge that the P550 represents. SiFive is proud to set the standard for RISC-V processing and is ready to deliver these products to customers today.\u201d\n \u201cWe are pleased to be a lead development partner with SiFive to showcase to mutual customers the impressive performance of their P550 on our 7nm Horse Creek platform,&#34; said Amber Huffman, Intel Fellow and CTO of IP engineering group at Intel. &#34;By combining Intel&#39;s leading-edge interface IP such as DDR and PCIe with SiFive&#39;s highest performance processor, Horse Creek will provide a valuable and expandable development vehicle for cutting-edge RISC-V applications.&#34;\n \u201cGrowing from its initial success in embedded processors to tackle the application processor market requires the performance, efficiency, and features demonstrated in the new SiFive Performance P550 core,\u201d said Kevin Krewell, Principal Analyst, TIRIAS Research. \u201cCombined with the maturing and growing open-source software ecosystem for RISC-V developed by leading technology industry companies, chip designers have a real choice for their next SoC application processor core.\u201d\n The SiFive Performance P550 features a thirteen-stage, triple-issue, out-of-order pipeline compatible with the RISC-V RV64GC ISA. Evolved from the previously announced SiFive U84 microarchitecture, Performance P550 scales up to four-core complex configurations that use a similar amount of area as a single Arm Cortex-A75 while delivering a significant performance-per-area advantage.\n The SiFive Performance P270 is an 8-stage, dual-issue, highly efficient in-order pipeline compatible with the RISC-V RV64GCV ISA. With full support for the RISC-V Vector Extension v 1.0RC, and combined with SiFive Recode, which translates existing SIMD software from popular legacy architectures to RISC-V Vector assembly code, the SiFive Performance P270 is an ideal replacement for dated SIMD architectures.\n The new SiFive Performance family joins the recently announced SiFive Intelligence family that is focused on AI &amp; ML applications, and the broadly adopted SiFive Essential family of configurable cores that includes the U/S/E-Series of 64-bit and 32-bit processors.\n For more on the complete SiFive processor portfolio, see CEO Patrick Little\u2019s blog  here. Both products in the SiFive Performance family are available  now. SiFive will conduct a webinar with details about the SiFive Performance, Intelligence, and Essential product families on July 14th with registration available  here.\n About SiFive SiFive is the leading provider of processor cores, AI accelerators, and SoC IP to enable domain-specific designs based on the open RISC-V instruction set architecture specification. SiFive offers scalable, configurable processor cores pre-integrated with security, trace, and debug features for workload-specific accelerator designs. Founded by the inventors of RISC-V, SiFive has design centers worldwide and backing from Sutter Hill Ventures, SK hynix, Qualcomm Ventures, Western Digital, Intel Capital, Spark Capital, Osage University Partners, and Prosperity7 Ventures.

", "note_en": "The Chromium team has patched a  2.5-year-old bug that made it possible to stage cross-site scripting ( XSS) attacks on web pages, even if they had been configured to prevent XSS attacks.\n Discovered by Jun Kokatsu, browser security researcher at  Microsoft, the bug allowed crafty attackers to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP), an HTTP header that restricts external resources loaded and run on the web page.\n  In a proof-of-concept, Kokatsu showed that if a web application creates a  Blob URL with attacker-controlled data, it could lead to XSS attacks \u2013 even if the site is protected with strict CSP policies. Blobs are raw data that can be read as text or streams.\n Due to the way iframes (embedded HTML pages) inherit headers and policies from their parent page, an attacker could exploit the bug to bypass the CSP rules and execute malicious code on the page.\n    For example, a recent  XSS vulnerability in chat.mozilla.org occurred due to creating a Blob URL from a Blob object passed by an attacker.\n \u201cThis XSS could have been still exploitable even if they had CSP,\u201d Kokatsu told  The Daily Swig in written comments.\n Kokatsu also said that the attack could be staged on other URL schemes, including  data: and  javascript: URLs.\n  Kokatsu discovered the bug in December 2018. It was  initially dismissed as something of a non-issue, but the Chromium team later acknowledged its severity and implemented new container security policies in the Chromium specification.\n \u201cNot many people realize that cross-origin pages can navigate iframes or windows opened by them,\u201d Kokatsu said. \u201cThis understanding is required to understand the attack, and the problem space of policy inheritance issues in the CSP\u2019s specification.\u201d\n Nonetheless, due to its complexity, it took more than two years to get the bug fixed. \u201cCSP needs to  inherit policy to  local scheme, because those schemes (e.g.,  about:,  blob:,  data:,  javascript:) don\u2019t have response headers,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n    While some of the schemes were relatively easy to solve, Blob URLs were especially difficult to patch because it\u2019s hard to track which document created the URL.\n \u201cTherefore, they had to make a new concept in HTML\u2019s specification to track this information,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n The new HTML specification,  Policy Container, provides more granular control over the policies inherited across HTML documents and their embedded components. It currently applies to CSP and Referrer Policy only. Kokatsu says it needs to be applied to other policies as well.\n  Using iframes has been fraught with security concerns. \u201cThe ability to link other pages or frame other pages has been one of the benefits of the web. However, it does add complexity to the ecosystem both from browser security and web security,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n Browser vendors are constantly trying to develop new specifications and tools to mitigate attacks through embedded frames. Some of these specifications include  X-Frame-options,  iframe sandbox, and  Permission Policy.\n \u201cWhile threats to/from iframes will continue, I\u2019m hopeful that over time we can mitigate many attacks, and move to a safer web,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n \u201cAs attack[s] advance, what\u2019s important is to understand what\u2019s working, and where we need more specific mitigation, and then apply more defense on those spots.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 00:17:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "chrome,xss,kokatsu", "title": "CSP\u65c1\u8def\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2aChrome XSS\u9519\u8bef\u82b1\u4e862.5\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14HTML\u89c4\u8303\u66f4\u6539\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d ", "title_en": "CSP bypass: How one Chrome XSS bug took 2.5 years and an HTML spec change to fix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/csp-bypass-how-one-chrome-xss-bug-took-2-5-years-and-an-html-spec-change-to-fix", "via": "", "real_tags": ["chrome", "xss", "kokatsu"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ff0287210796737fd34a6056d629fa7a.png", "infoid": 1067477, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5728Android 4.2\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0API\u3002\u867d\u7136\u770b\u7740Usermanager\u7c7b\uff0c\u6211\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\n  5\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6765\u907f\u514d\u4e00\u4e9bJava\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u8c01\u8bfb\u8fc7API\u3002\u548c\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u53c2\u8003\u94ec\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb\u3002\r \r -  Dorian.\n  \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u8c37\u6b4c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c71\u7f8a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c71\u666f\u603b\u90e8\u7684\u5272\u8349\u673a\u6709\u5173\u3002\r \r -  John Isaiah Carmona\n  Googlers\u4f3c\u4e4e\u50cf\u5c71\u7f8a\u51fa\u4e8e\u67d0\u79cd\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u96be\u602a\u4ed6\u4eec\u628a\u590d\u6d3b\u8282\u5f69\u86cb\u62ff\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u5c71\u7f8a\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u4e5f\u6709\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\uff08\uff01\uff09\u6295\u8d44\uff1a - \u5c31\u5728GoogleBlog\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u5c71\u7f8a\u5272\u8349 - \u5c71\u7f8a\u662fBaaaahk  - \u5e76\u5728YouTube\u4e2d\u5f55\u5236\u5728\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u539f\u751f\u5f8b\u7684\u642c\u8fd0\u5de5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\r \r-  \u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\n  \u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e4b\u661f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u4e5f\u6709\u5e38\u6570.Android.com/Reference/Android/hardware/\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u89c6\u8282\u76ee\u5c9b\u4e0a\u4e22\u5931\u7684developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/...\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u3002\r \r -  Fernando Gallego\n  \u4ed6\u4eec\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u68d2\u68d2\u7cd6\u4e4b\u540e\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u6587\u6863\uff1a\uff06\uff0334;\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68d2\u68d2\u7cd6\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5c71\u7f8a\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5c71\u7f8a\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\r \r - \u5e15\u7279\u91cc\u514b\n    \u6765\u81eaAndroid R\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fd4\u56deFalse\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u8bf4\u8fd9\u662f\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u4fdd\u62a4\u5c71\u7f8a\u9690\u79c1\uff06\uff0334 ;: \n/ ** *\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u662f\u5426\u9075\u5b88\u7684\u7528\u6237\u662f\u53d7\u5230*\u4f20\u9001\u7684\u3002 * *\uff06lt;

Someone has previously stated that it might be an   Easter egg.\n In API 21 the implementation was changed to check if there is an installed app with the package  com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator\n /** * Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to * teleportations. * * &lt;p&gt;As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method can * now automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt; * * @return Returns true if the user making this call is a goat. */public boolean isUserAGoat() { return mContext.getPackageManager() .isPackageAvailable(&#34;com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator&#34;);}\n  15  Theory: Goats are found in all kinds of precarious places, like sheer cliffs, possibly bucking location trends they get from regular non-goat users. Might explain &#34;teleportations&#34;, which could be goats appearing to wildly relocate as the software tries to determine their location with algos designed for non-goats.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 tedders\n  This is a history lesson, not an answer. Even if it is an Easter egg, is there a valid use case for it? Being an Easter egg doesn&#39;t preclude it from being useful, and you&#39;ve not shown whether it is or is not useful.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 casperOne\n    I feel bad for anyone who cheekily used this function, expecting it to return  false forever.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Martin Konecny\n  @raulk Yes, they used the ID of that app, they didn&#39;t pick a random app ID and then happen to have someone create an app with that ID...\r \r\u2013\u00a0 user253751\n      I don&#39;t know if this was &#34;the&#34; official use case, but the following produces a warning in Java (that can further produce compile errors if mixed with  return statements, leading to unreachable code):\n    So I often find myself writing a silly utility method for the quickest way to dummy out a code block, then in completing debugging find all calls to it, so provided the implementation doesn&#39;t change this can be used for that.\n JLS points out  if (false) does not trigger &#34;unreachable code&#34; for the specific reason that this would break support for debug flags, i.e., basically this use case (h/t @auselen). ( static final boolean DEBUG = false; for instance).\n I replaced  while for  if, producing a more obscure use case. I  believe you can trip up your IDE, like Eclipse, with this behavior, but this edit is 4 years into the future, and I don&#39;t have an Eclipse environment to play with.\n  12  @djechlin I do not know if this is android only, in standard java ` if(false){...}` compiles just fine (open jdk javac 1.6 and 1.7)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 josefx\n  @PeterOlson - if you are specifically trying to test a code branch where an if goes false or true, this is the most precise and obvious way to simulate that - commenting out the block could be less accurate if you don&#39;t match to the proper end of the block (perhaps you didn&#39;t notice a discreet if/else block immediately following), it will lead to a compile error if you&#39;re forcing to the following  else block, etc.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 djechlin\n  &#34;provided the implementation doesn&#39;t change&#34; - and there&#39;s the problem. This is a disastrous way to implement a warning-free &#34;if (false)&#34; because the implementation can and does change. See my answer to this question: as of API21  isUserAGoat() returns true if a user has a specific app installed. Good luck diagnosing that when your code suddenly starts behaving oddly on &#34;random&#34; devices!\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Mark Whitaker\n    @thedayturns If goats start using Android devices this will be the least of our problems.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Szymon Drosdzol\n    This appears to be an inside joke at Google. It&#39;s also featured in the Google Chrome task manager. It has no purpose, other than some engineers finding it amusing. Which is a purpose by itself, if you will.\n     int TaskManagerModel::GetGoatsTeleported(int index) const { int seed = goat_salt_ * (index + 1); return (seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255;}\n  14  i don&#39;t have it, where do you right click? or what it is used for\r \r\u2013\u00a0 auselen\n  @auselen You have to right click on a column title in order to see the drop down menu to add the Goats Teleported column (at least that&#39;s how it works in Chrome on OS X).  cl.ly/Ksbd\r \r\u2013\u00a0 greenie\n  Windows XP + latest Chrome = it isn&#39;t there, on Ubuntu I see it.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 auselen\n  @Xeoncross Yes because nobody has put an easter egg in Windows software, ever.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Mark Allen\n      Complementing the @djechlin  answer (good answer by the way!), this function call could be  also used as dummy code to hold a breakpoint in an IDE when you want to stop in some specific iteration or a particular recursive call, for example:\n  isUserAGoat() could be used instead of a dummy variable declaration that will be shown in the IDE as a warning and, in Eclipse particular case, will clog the breakpoint mark, making it difficult to enable/disable it. If the method is used as a convention, all the invocations could be later filtered by some script (during commit phase maybe?).\n  Google guys are heavy Eclipse users (they provide several of their projects as Eclipse plugins: Android SDK, GAE, etc), so the @djechlin answer and this complementary answer make a lot of sense (at least for me).\n  8  If you are writing &#34;dummy&#34; code just to quickly test something, what is the problem with an Eclipse warning?? I think this is actually great as you can find it in case you&#39;ve forgotten\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Tomasz\n  @Tomasz the problem is that, in Eclipse, the warning mark clutters the breakpoint, and you have to open the breakpoint view to either deactivate or remove it\r \r\u2013\u00a0 higuaro\n  Yeah, I have a solution for that. You can right click on the warning symbol and select &#34;Toggle Breakpoint&#34;. If the following line/option is enabled it means the breakpoint is created. My point was, dummy code is bad and it should be a warning so yo don&#39;t forget ;)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Tomasz\n  @Tomasz The problem with that solution is that you have know beforehand where the breakpoint is, so a simple visual inspection won&#39;t let you know that the warning hides a breakpoint, an even better solution though, is to use conditional breakpoints, with them you can forget about dummy code (and convention methods) altogether, but those differ between IDE&#39;s and can&#39;t be automatically shared among workstations\r \r\u2013\u00a0 higuaro\n  Why not just use a null statement  ;? I mean, goats are clearly better, but there is an easy way around this already\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Bassinator\n    The only practical use I ever saw was in the Last Call for  Google I/O Contest where they asked what it was for a particular version, to see if contestants read the API diff report for each release. The contest had programming problems too, but generally some trivia that could be graded automatically first to get the number of submissions down to reasonable amounts that would be easier to check.\n  7  &#34;There&#39;s a funny named method/constant/whatever in each version of Android.&#34; Could you name some?\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Angelo.Hannes\n  For example, there are a nivel of log called Log.wtf that they call What a Terrible Failure :P\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Aracem\n      @Angelo.Hannes, In the Sensor Constants for Gravity there&#39;s one for Death Star (Star Wars)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 st0le\n    Sheeps are people for whom speech recognition works exceptionally well, and goats are people for whom it works exceptionally poorly. Only the voice recognizer knows what separates them. People can&#39;t predict whose voice will be recognized easily and whose won&#39;t. The best policy is to design the interface so it can handle all kinds of voices in all kinds of environments\n Maybe, it is planned to mark Android users as goats in the future to be able to configure the speech recognition engine for goats&#39; needs. ;-)\n  0\n    As of API 21 (the first Android 5.0/Lollipop SDK), this detects whether the  Goat Simulator app is installed:\n /** * Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to * teleportations. * * &lt;p&gt;As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method can * now automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt; * * @return Returns true if the user making this call is a goat. */public boolean isUserAGoat() { return mContext.getPackageManager() .isPackageAvailable(&#34;com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator&#34;);}\n This should make it clear that  djechlin&#39;s suggestion of using it as a warning-free  if (false) is a potentially disastrous strategy. What previously returned  false for every device now returns a seemingly random value: if this was buried deep enough in your code it could take a  long time to figure out where your new bugs are coming from.\n Bottom line: if you don&#39;t control the implementation of a method and decide to use it for purposes other than stated in the API documentation, you&#39;re heading for trouble.\n  2  Why would anyone ever put any kind of  if(false) in production? Come on here. If that&#39;s what your code looks like then this implementation changing is the  least of your problems.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 djechlin\n  @djechlin &#34;do we need this feature?  changes to if(false),  tests feature nope.  checks in&#34;\r \r\u2013\u00a0 user253751\n    Google has a serious liking for goats and goat based  Easter eggs. There has even been  previous Stack\u00a0Overflow posts about it.\n As has been mentioned in previous posts, it also exists within the Chrome task manager ( it first appeared in the wild in 2009):\n  And then in Windows, Linux and Mac versions of Chrome early 2010). The number of &#34;Goats Teleported&#34; is in fact  random:\n int TaskManagerModel::GetGoatsTeleported(int index) const { int seed = goat_salt_ * (index + 1); return (seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255; }\n   The earliest correlation of goats and Google belongs in the original &#34;Mowing with goats&#34; blog post, as far as I can tell.\n We can safely assume that it&#39;s merely an Easter egg and has no real-world use, except for returning  false.\n  1\n    There is a similar call,  isUserAMonkey(), that returns true if the  MonkeyRunner tool is being used. The SDK explanation is just as curious as this one.\n   I expect that this was added in anticipation of a new  SDK tool named something with a goat and will  actually be functional to test for the presence of that tool.\n  1  My assumption with this one is it allows the  ActivityManager to report if it has been invoked by the  monkey ui stress testing tool, but i have never confirmed this.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 CtrlF\n    Funny Easter Egg.  In Ubuntu version of Chrome, in Task Manager ( shift+ esc), with right-click you can add a sci-fi column that in italian version is &#34;Capre Teletrasportate&#34; (Teleported Goats).\n  0\n    If you have Goat Simulator installed, you&#39;re a goat.If you don&#39;t have it installed, you&#39;re not a goat.\n I imagine it was more of a personal experiment by one of the developers, most likely to find people with a common interest.\n  2  The method was created before the goat simulator. Although it checks if the app is installed now, it didn&#39;t do anything before. And it&#39;s a joke anyway.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Ricardo A.\n  Google Chrome&#39;s tab monitor had an easter egg column \u00abgoats teleported\u00bb (and  isUserAGoat docs refers to goats teleportation too. So it&#39;s definitely an internal joke.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 artem\n    Not the answer you&#39;re looking for?

", "note_en": "Five-year-olds are suffering panic attacks about meeting their friends, NHS leaders have said, amid warnings  1.5 million children will need mental health treatment in the wake of repeated lockdowns.\n Experts said young children had become increasingly anxious, with some fearful of leaving their homes, amid an explosion in \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d across the country.\n Waits of up to four years for help on the NHS have forced a growing number of families to seek help from private psychologists - only to find that they are oversubscribed and unable to take on more patients, a Telegraph investigation reveals.\n Leading private therapists said they are taking twice the normal level of calls from worried parents, forcing them to turn away patients, or open waiting lists for the first time in their careers.\n  Experts said many children were  suffering behavioural problems fuelled by lockdowns, social distancing and fear of infection, with many now anxious about everyday social activities.\n Forecasts seen by this newspaper state that an extra 1.5 million children and young people will require mental health support \u201cas a direct impact of the pandemic\u201d during the next three to five years. \u00a0The calculations from the Centre for Mental Health, involving NHS economists, suggest demand will be as much as three times greater than the capacity of mental health services.\n Dame Rachel De Souza, Children&#39;s Commissioner for England, said a survey of more than 550,000 children - the largest such poll in history - will show mental health to be the greatest concern of this generation of children.\n She said her visits across the country, as part of a forthcoming commission, had found children suffering \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d and struggling to adjust to changes to their lives since the pandemic.\n At a meeting run by the NHS Confederation, a number of health officials said they were struggling to find help for their own children, who had become increasingly disturbed since the first lockdown.\n One senior figure said: \u201cMy five-year-old is housebound because she&#39;s too scared to go away from the house, never mind to school. No one can even refer me to someone privately as they don&#39;t know of any local child psychotherapists who will see someone of her age.\u201d\n Another told how her young daughter, now undergoing counselling, had a panic attack about going on a \u201cplay date\u201d, after a year of enforced lockdowns and social distancing.\n  Dame Rachel told the meeting: \u201cI\u2019ve been around the country and seen those sad little faces \u2026 putting their arms around their friends as they tell me about having their trauma from losing a grandparent, not being able to go to a funeral. Coming out of lockdown and not knowing how to make friends anymore, not knowing how to talk to anyone else,\u201d she said.\n \u201cEveryone is on edge,\u201d she said, warning of a \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d affecting swathes of young people, at the session last week.\n The UK\u2019s largest private mental health partnership, Clinical Partners, is now holding 85 per cent more private appointments for children than in 2019.\n Before Covid struck, most private child mental health experts were typically able to fit in patients for a first appointment within one or two weeks. But the pandemic has caused a surge in mental health problems in young people, with one in six under-18s now thought to have a diagnosable condition, such as anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder or eating disorders.\n The rise in demand has heaped pressures on the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, with waiting lists for a first appointment as long as four years in some areas.\n During the 12 months since the first lockdown, 420,504 children and young people have received NHS treatment for mental health problems, an 11 per cent rise in two years.\n  Child psychologist Maryhan Baker has seen demand for her services double in recent months, with average waiting times jumping from two weeks to nearly four months.\n \u201cI\u2019m working longer hours and more evenings to fit more people in but the demand is beyond my own individual capability,\u201d she said.\n  She said many parents who approached her for help had been warned by GPs \u201cnot to bother\u201d waiting for an NHS appointment.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. There are a lot of children who were maybe just a bit anxious before the pandemic presenting now with compulsions, eating disorders, self-harm and other control behaviours,\u201d she said.\n Consultant psychologist Dr Elena Touroni said waiting times for children\u2019s services at her practice, The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, had grown by at least 50 per cent.\n On Tuesday, NHS England will promise an extra \u00a340m for children\u2019s mental health services.\n NHS England director for mental health Claire Murdoch said: \u201cThe pandemic has turned young people\u2019s lives upside down, and while in some areas of the country staff are now treating more young people than ever before, the NHS has worked with schools and other local agencies to ensure early intervention and support, including through 183 mental health support teams working with schools across the country.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 00:15:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6050\u614c,olds,\u513f\u7ae5", "title": "\u4e94\u5c81\u7684\u5b69\u5b50'\u6050\u614c\u88ad\u51fb\u4e0e\u670b\u53cb\u4ea4\u5f80\u793e\u4ea4 ", "title_en": "Five year olds 'having panic attacks over socializing with their friends'", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/21/five-year-olds-having-panic-attacks-social-contact-say-experts/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6050\u614c", "olds", "\u513f\u7ae5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8946844b86a269c3fac6d95001a13baf.jpg", "infoid": 1067475, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u641c\u7d22Quake\u662f\u7531ID\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7531GT Internactive\u4e8e1996\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u5b83\u662fQuake\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002 [5]\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u79cd\u8ff7\u5bab\u822c\u7684\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6765\u627e\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6b66\u5668\u4f5c\u51fa\u5404\u79cd\u602a\u7269\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6c1b\u56f4\u662f\u9ed1\u6697\u548c\u575a\u97e7\u7684\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u77f3\u6750\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u751f\u9508\u7684\uff0c\u5927\u5199\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\n ID\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7ee7\u627f\u8005\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Quake is a  first-person shooter  video game developed by  id Software and published by  GT Interactive in  1996. It is the first game in the   Quake series.  [5] In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry. The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with many stone  textures and a rusty, capitalized  font.\n The successor to id Software&#39;s   Doom series,  Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.  [6] Unlike the   Doom engine before it, the   Quake engine offered full  real-time 3D rendering and had early support for  3D acceleration through  OpenGL. After   Doom helped to popularize  multiplayer  deathmatches in 1993,  Quake added various multiplayer options.  Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the  QuakeWorld update and software such as  QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n     In  Quake &#39;s single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, &#34;Nightmare&#34;, was &#34;so bad that it was hidden, so people won&#39;t wander in by accident&#34;;  [7] the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n Quake &#39;s single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a &#34;low gravity&#34; level that challenges the player&#39;s abilities in a different way). If the player&#39;s character dies, he must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub &#34;START&#34; level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of  Quake) has the most traditional ideology of a  boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the &#34;END&#34; level which contains a final puzzle.\n  In multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player&#39;s computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in  co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of  deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either  free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one  duels, or organized  teamplay with two or more players per team (or  clan). Players frequently implement  mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n The gameplay in  Quake was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.  [8]  Bunny hopping or strafe jumping allow faster movement, while  rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to  Quake &#39;s appeal. Multiplayer  Quake was one of the first games singled out as a form of  electronic sport.  [9] A notable participant was  Dennis Fong, who won  John Carmack&#39;s  Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored  Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.\n  In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the unnamed protagonist called Ranger in later games (voiced by  Trent Reznor)  [10] who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy  code-named &#34;Quake&#34;. The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a &#34;Slipgate&#34;; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the &#34;Human&#34; dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n The sole surviving protagonist in &#34;Operation Counterstrike&#34; is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger&#39;s main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\n The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or &#34;maps&#34;, divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game&#39;s final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of  gothic,  medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of  Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game&#39;s setting is inspired by  dark fantasy influences, including  H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s  Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the &#34;Spawn&#34; enemies are called &#34;Formless Spawn of  Tsathoggua&#34; in the manual, the  boss of the first episode is named  Chthon, and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a  Dark Young). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and  The Nameless City. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n    A preview included with  id&#39;s very first release, 1990&#39;s   Commander Keen, advertised a game entitled  The Fight for Justice as a follow-up to the  Commander Keen trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, &#34;the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent&#34;, armed with thunderbolts and a &#34;Ring of Regeneration&#34;. Conceived as a  VGA full-color  side-scrolling  role-playing game,  The Fight for Justice was never released.\n Lead designer and director  John Romero later conceived of  Quake as an  action game taking place in a fully  3D world, inspired by  Sega AM2&#39;s 3D  fighting game   Virtua Fighter.  Quake was also intended to feature  Virtua Fighter influenced third-person  melee combat, but id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after  Quake was released.  [11]  [12] Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from  Quake.  [13] In 2000, Romero released   Daikatana, the game that he envisioned  Quake being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time,  [14]  [15] he said  Daikatana was &#34;more fun to make than  Quake&#34; due to the lack of creative interference.  [16]\n Quake was given as a title to the game that  id Software was working on shortly after the release of   Doom II. The earliest information released described  Quake as focusing on a  Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer,  [17]  [18]  [19] and is able to knock away enemies by throwing the hammer (complete with real-time  inverse kinematics). [   citation needed] Initially, the levels were supposed to be designed in an  Aztec style, but the choice was dropped some months into the project. [   citation needed] Early screenshots then showed medieval environments and dragons. [   citation needed] The plan was for the game to have more  RPG-style elements. However, work was very slow on the engine, since  John Carmack, the main programmer of  Quake, was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model (Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things). [   citation needed] Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers.  [20]\n Eventually, the whole id Software team began to think that the original concept may not have been as wise a choice as they first believed.  [19] Thus, the final game was very stripped down from its original intentions, and instead featured gameplay similar to  Doom and its sequel, although the levels and enemies were closer to medieval RPG style rather than science-fiction. In a December 1, 1994 post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, &#34;Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say &#34;action&#34;? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout \u2013 probably more so than Doom&#34;.  [21]\n Quake was programmed by John Carmack,  Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by  American McGee,  Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and  Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by  Adrian Carmack,  Kevin Cloud and  Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using  Alias.  [22]\n The  game engine developed for  Quake, the   Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the first-person shooter genre: polygonal models instead of  prerendered  sprites; full 3D level design instead of a  2.5D map;  prerendered  lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with  QuakeC), which popularized fan-created  modifications (mods).\n Before the release of the full game or the shareware version of  Quake, id Software released  QTest on February 24, 1996. It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions.  QTest gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the  Quake engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.  [23]\n Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a  gun-butt.  [19] Shortly before release this was replaced with an  axe.\n   Quake &#39;s music and sound design was done by  Trent Reznor and  Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized  drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the  Quake soundtrack &#34;is not music, it&#39;s textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It&#39;s been fun.&#34;  [24] The game also includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the &#34;Nailgun&#34; and &#34;Super Nailgun&#34; decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.\n Digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original  shareware release.\n  The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor on July 5, 1996,  [3] followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. The first commercially released port was the port to Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port&#39;s release,  [25] leading to MacSoft&#39;s involvement) in late August 1997.  [4] ClickBOOM announced version for  Amiga-computers in 1998.  [26] Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by  Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the three add-ons as  Quake: The Offering.  [27]  [28]  [29]\n Quake was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the  Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself,  [30] but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by  Sega.  [31] Sega then took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent  frame rate, and assigned it to  Lobotomy Software.  [32] The Sega Saturn port used Lobotomy Software&#39;s own 3D game engine,  SlaveDriver (the same game engine that powered the Sega Saturn versions of   PowerSlave and   Duke Nukem 3D), instead of the original  Quake engine.  [33] It is the only version of  Quake that is rated &#34;T&#34; for Teen instead of &#34;M&#34; for Mature.\n Quake had also been ported to the  Sony  PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the port was cancelled due to difficulties in finding a publisher. A port of  Quake for the  Atari Jaguar was also advertized as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of   Ultimate Future Games magazine, but it was never released.  [34]  [35] Another port of  Quake was also slated for  Panasonic M2 but never occurred due to the cancellation of the system.  [36]\n On March 24, 1998, the game was released for the  Nintendo 64 by  Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on   Doom 64,  [37] at id Software&#39;s request.  [38] The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.  [39]\n Both console ports required compromises because of the limited  CPU power and  ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU.  [40] The Sega Saturn version includes 28 of the 32 single-player levels from the original PC version of the game, though the secret levels, Ziggurat Vertigo (E1M8), The Underearth (E2M7), The Haunted Halls (E3M7), and The Nameless City (E4M8), were removed. Instead, it has four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell&#39;s Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, &#34;Dank &amp; Scuz&#34;, which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a  slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Sega Saturn version; as a result of this, all of the deathmatch maps from the PC version were removed from the Sega Saturn port. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto (E1M4), The Installation (E2M1), The Ebon Fortress (E2M4), The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), The Sewage System (E4M1), and Hell&#39;s Atrium (E4M5) levels. It also does not use the hub &#34;START&#34; map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order from The Slipgate Complex (E1M1) to Shub Niggurath&#39;s Pit (END). The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, and an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death, is also included.\n Two ports of  Quake for the Nintendo DS exist,  QuakeDS  [41] and  CQuake.  [42] Both run well, however, multiplayer does not work on  QuakeDS.  [41] Since the source code for  Quake was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones.  [43]  [44]  [45] The  Rockbox project also distributes a version of  Quake that runs on some MP3 players.  [46]\n In 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of  Quake for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions.  [47] Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360.  [48]  Quake mobile was reviewed by  GameSpot on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a  Best Mobile Game&#34; in their E3 2005 Editor&#39;s Choice Awards.  [49] It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v both of which are PDAs not mobile phones.  [49]  Quake Mobile does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints.  [48]  Quake Mobile runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of  Quake Mobile is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two  Quake expansion packs,  Scourge of Armagon and  Dissolution of Eternity, are also available for  Quake Mobile.\n A  Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs  Quake at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.  [50]\n  Quake can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in  QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan created &#34;mods&#34;. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in  Quake fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software&#39;s original release.\n The first major  Quake mod was   Team Fortress. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter  Soldier class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the  Scout class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one&#39;s flag in  Threewave CTF would return the flag to the base, and in  TF the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to  Threewave CTF.  Team Fortress maintained its standing as the most-played online  Quake modification for many years. Team Fortress would go on to become   Team Fortress Classic and get a sequel,   Team Fortress 2.\n Another popular mod was   Threewave  Capture the Flag (CTF), primarily authored by Dave &#39;Zoid&#39; Kirsch.

But I was reminded of it this morning when I saw  a new report on electric vehicle accessibility. Compiled by the Consumer Choice Center (CCC), the report scores all 50 states based on how hard they make it to buy an EV, whether that&#39;s banning direct-to-consumer sales or requiring extra registration fees or  road charges. Unsurprisingly, the United States is a bit of a patchwork in this regard. But it&#39;s not quite as simple as red states making it hard and blue states making it easy to buy an EV.\n  Ten states score top marks with the CCC: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. All these states will allow direct sales of cars to individuals, and none will make you pay more to register your new EV than you&#39;d pay for a new car with an internal combustion engine (ICE). (The District of Columbia would also go in this group if DC-based CCC had included it.)\n California is conspicuous by its absence in that top 10. The state is the leading market for EVs within the US, with  the highest adoption rate and the most public chargers.\u00a0 Nearly half of all US-registered EVs\u00a0are on its roads. But California also has an escalating EV license fee that&#39;s currently $100 but is now linked to the consumer price index.\n Because it&#39;s possible to register some gasoline-powered vehicles in California for less than $100, the state joins the &#34;somewhat accessible&#34; group, along with Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Most of those states, like California, lost points because they have extra EV registration fees, but Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all have some restrictions on automakers selling cars directly to the public.\n The &#34;barely accessible&#34; states were Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. A few of these states prohibit direct auto sales but don&#39;t charge more to register an EV than an ICE vehicle, others allow Tesla (but no other automaker) to sell direct to the public, and some do both.\n  Finally, there are the inaccessible states: Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Each of these place plenty of roadblocks between their citizens and a new EV, banning any direct sales within their borders as well as making it more expensive to register an EV than an ICE vehicle.\n  In total, 28 states make it more expensive to register an EV, and 17 have completely banned Tesla and others from selling their cars straight to the public. Twelve other states have some restrictions on direct sales, including allowing Tesla (but no other automaker) to make them.\n &#34;It is clear that consumers want more access to electric vehicles. Therefore legislation should make the purchase and ownership of them as convenient as possible, and we urge legislators to put forth better policies that will reduce the significant barriers currently preventing consumers from fully\u00a0accessing EVs,&#34; said CCC&#39;s North American affairs manager David Clement, co-author of the study.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:37:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d2d\u4e70,states,ev", "title": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u76849\u4e2a\u6700\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 ", "title_en": "These are the 9 worst states to buy an electric car in", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/these-are-the-9-worst-states-to-buy-an-electric-car-in/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d2d\u4e70", "states", "ev"]}]
