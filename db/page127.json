", "note_en": "GoPro has just announced a new open API for 3rd party companies/apps to use, called  Open GoPro, allowing them to integrate with their cameras, starting with the GoPro Hero 9. The API (Application Programming Interface) allows a slew of functions over wireless interfaces, including control as well as transfer of media. Most notably, the API is not \u2018gated\u2019 behind some corporate partnership deal, instead, anyone can get to work creating apps to integrate with it.\n If a GoPro API sounds familiar to you, it might be. It was a mere half a decade ago that GoPro announced their GoPro Developer Program. In theory, it covered many of the same features as today\u2019s program. But in practice, it wasn\u2019t open. So we saw some companies,  like Polar, actually implement it in their products (ok, a handful of products). So did some drone companies,  including 3DR &amp;  AirDog. But it required GoPro to set up a partnership there with all the complexities that brought with it. Other companies, such as Wahoo though, couldn\u2019t get into the program (they tried, hoping to integrate it with the Wahoo bike computers).\n Whereas, this new open program resolves that, as there\u2019s no longer a gatekeeper to the program. It\u2019s just an open interface anyone can use.\n And the potential is massive for people wanting to develop Really Cool Stuff\u2122. For example, in reading through all the documents, in the sports realm, one could develop:\n \u2013 A Garmin Connect IQ App for your bike computer or watch to control the GoPro \u2013 A desktop app to automatically connect wirelessly to your GoPro and offload all the content to a local computer or NAS device \u2013 FPV drone control integration, without having to hack things apart\n And in fact, at launch, there are five specific scenarios that are being lit-up by 3rd party companies:\n \u2013 Amazfit watches will have GoPro camera control from the wrist. \u2013 Sena cycling helmets will have voice control of your GoPro \u2013 Centurion Boats: wirelessly control a GoPro from the boat\u2019s helm control screen \u2013 Orqa: FPV goggle control (drones) to see camera status in goggles \u2013 Pixellot: They do sports broadcasting, this controls all the GoPro\u2019s and handles content transfer\n However, there are some limitations that, at least in this first iteration, mean the world isn\u2019t entirely your oyster. There\u2019s no support for capturing the video stream live, nor is there any API connectivity into GoPro\u2019s online platform, formerly known as GoPro Plus (to access your stored media there). Still, maybe later.\n For the geeks in the crowd, press on. For everyone else, fear not, I\u2019ll circle back when I find some cool apps down the road worth mentioning (after developers have a chance to develop them).\n   Obviously, this is gonna get geeky\u2026really geeky. But not as geeky as it could be. I\u2019ll leave it to you to dive into the full code examples and demos, as well as actual API documentation. Instead, I figured I\u2019d get the highlights out of the way. Invariably though, like any development project, it takes a bit of coding to really start to understand the potential (and limitations).\n GoPro says that for this iteration, they\u2019re focused on these key camera areas, all at the device layer. Meaning, talking directly to the camera (versus talking to the GoPro app or GoPro cloud):\n \u2013 Wireless connectivity \u2013 Camera status \u2013 Camera command and control \u2013 Preview \u2013 SD card access\n At present, this is launching on the Hero 9, but I\u2019m gonna take a guess we\u2019ll see it expand backwards to other cameras, just like they did with GoPro Labs (now supported on the Hero 7, Hero 8, Hero 9, and Max). It makes sense to start small. Plus, they even have a table in their documentation that lists just a single entry. No point in having a table for listing one item.\n  Now GoPro\u2019s media e-mail states both wired and wireless connectivity, though all the documentation just mentioned wireless. So my guess is wired is coming soon too. For the wireless side, there\u2019s two ways to interact with the camera:\n  However, in order to get access to WiFi, you\u2019ll need to enable it via Bluetooth Smart. This is how GoPro cameras have worked for years, in that your phone typically initializes the connection via BLE, turning on the WiFi (thus, saving battery). Back in the \u2018old school days\u2019, pre-BLE, WiFi was just on all the time (and, then, the cause of some interference issues with certain bike computers too\u2026). As usual, a GoPro keeps its BLE service running in the background for 8 hours after the last button press/going to sleep (meaning, even after you power it off, it\u2019s still sending BLE advertisements for 8 hours, which is  how you can find it when you lose it).\n In order to connect to BLE, your app (or device, like watch) will establish a pairing with the camera, in the same way you pair the GoPro app. It\u2019ll save this pairing for subsequent pairings.\n Meanwhile, for the WiFi side, authentication to the camera merely requires inputting the GoPro\u2019s unique WiFi SSID &amp; password, making it relatively easy to connect to for apps and/or devices. However, based on everything I can understand right now in the documentation, the limitation is that you can\u2019t have the GoPro connect directly to your own home network and leverage the API that way. That would have been very useful for offloading footage directly onto your network (akin to what it does for GoPro\u2019s cloud solution, but to them). With the way it\u2019s implemented today (assuming I\u2019ve understood everything correctly), an app connects directly to the GoPro, and then pulls data via that direct WiFi connection over a small HTTP server that the GoPro runs.\n   However, within those, you can access tons of settings or file operations. For example, there\u2019s a table of some 113 different status codes at present that you can query to find the state of the camera. Here\u2019s a small snippet of those:\n  The proper snarky answer to status code 6 is always \u20181\u2019. I kid, I kid\u2026mostly.\n Now, in a nutshell, all the comments that GoPro has exposed essentially allow you to pretend to be a user on the device itself. That means you can change settings, start/stop recording, change resolutions, look at file properties (like videos or photos), and even download those videos. In fact, you can even trigger so-called \u2018Turbo\u2019 mode for faster WiFi downloads of media.\n The company has  published all of this over on GitHub, including walk-through tutorials in Python and Bash. And then demos in C/C++, C#, Python, and Swift.\n    And then they dive through each step of what\u2019s going on, and are chunked into different chapters. Here\u2019s\u00a0 a tiny snippet of one chapter:\n  Lastly, for fun, it\u2019s worth noting that in the documentation there\u2019s plenty of cleverly worded implications about what a GoPro Hero 10 might look like feature-wise (assumed for ~September). For example, in the \u2018Chapters\u2019 section, there\u2019s this seemingly innocuous tidbit:\n  Except, as one that has written plenty of technical documentation on how things work when you know the next version will change it (but want this document to still be valid when you forget about it later), you say stuff like this. Otherwise, you\u2019d simply say \u201cAll GoPro Cameras limit file sizes\u2026\u201d, which is true, till today anyway.\n Of course, even that\u2019s a bit untrue, as one of the GoPro Labs options is to tweak this setting and do  far larger file sizes, which is available on a number of past cameras. In any case, my suspicion here is that the Hero 10 will finally do away with requiring 4GB file chunking, which is frankly just a solid annoyance in 2021.\n Oh, and remember you\u2019ll  need to ensure your Hero 9 is on the latest firmware, which just came out today, in order to support this.\n     This is awesome. Simply put. Sure, I\u2019d love to see it on more cameras (hopefully soon, as the documents seem to imply), but having this at all is a huge step forward for the company. While GoPro labs was  great for power users last year (and some of those features grew up to normal features, and  new Labs features in 2021 too), this API is actually great for normal consumers too \u2013 even if they don\u2019t realize it yet. With GoPro launching today with companies like Amazfit doing watch control, and even a boat company (Centurion Boats) enabling GoPro control directly from the boat\u2019s helm, these are real-world solutions that people will actually use.\n  A) Garmin Connect IQ app to control a GoPro (or, even better, native integration): Sure, native integration is great since it appears Garmin is done with their VIRB foray. But Connect IQ wouldn\u2019t require any Garmin intervention at all, any random developer could do this. Hit me up if you do, and I\u2019ll write about it, pronto! This would be killer within the  newer GoPro Hindsight feature on the Hero 9, since it\u2019s doing a rolling 30-second buffer, so that I could tap something on my bike computer to grab whatever crazy event just happened.\n B) File offloading to a NAS: Within their press kit, they mention that Pixellot is using this for offloading of content into their sports broadcasting platform. I want basically that, but at my office. I want to be able to walk into the DCR Cave with a pile of GoPro\u2019s, plug them in, and have the content offload quickly via WiFi to my NAS server. Or at worst, a directory on a computer. I don\u2019t want to use my phone to do this. A Mac or PC driven app is where this would live (well, ideally it\u2019d automatically do this without any app driving it, but that\u2019s not plausible here).\n I\u2019m sure other folks will have other ideas. But those are the big ones for me, especially the file offloading bit. Even right now, coming back from a run, I\u2019m sitting here wishing the videos from that run were already accessible to my Mac &amp; PC, rather than dealing with fiddling with the GoPro app to get them synced over to my phone (taking up space, where the GoPro app currently occupies 80GB of storage on my phone), then duplicating that content into the phone\u2019s Photos, and having my phone be preoccupied while it\u2019s doing all that.\n Of course, I probably could just write this app myself. Or, I could eat ice cream. Both are valid choices.\n  At the end of the day, I\u2019m an athlete just like you looking for the most detail possible on a new purchase.

providing a minimal environment for me to build on and play with. I hope that for others it can be a distro which provides a working environment to use alongside various texts I have in mind, allowing the reader to focus on study of the material at hand rather than trying to get their environment setup right. The idea came about through having to side step from study to investigate broken stack traces and wondering about the level of pain when having to make build changes system-wide on a distribution which doesn\u2019t provide infrastructure to rebuild at mass with ease. When I first started writing about my experiments with  LFS it was suggested that I look at several different established distributions which were the answer to what I was looking for. I was aware of these distributions already and had even used some in the distant past, however I decided not to go down this path as there was either new tooling to learn which would drive system management or components were adapted (local changes and features). I was not interested in having to detour to learn another set of tools which are non-transferable between operating systems nor making use of derivatives before setting up the system how I needed it so that I could practice what I was studying, hence Viewpoint Linux strives to be innovationless in this regard.\n Viewpoint currently lacks a framework to ease building the system hence everything has been built slowly by hand with a specific idea of how the system should be.\n  It should work out of the box for texts in mind e.g full working stack traces for instrumenting with bpftrace and debugging using GDB\n its concept of base system is a subset of the utilities installed by the LFS guide, containing general utilities for users and tools for administration. Components which are purely build dependencies are installed to a separate prefix ( /osbt (os build tools)) so that they can be removed if desired. Everything else is satisfied from user installed packages which is currently provided by pkgsrc. Dependencies can grow out of hand, for example,  dwarves has a  cmake build dependency, dwarves provides the  pahole utility which is used as a kernel build dependency to generate  BTF but it\u2019s also a useful utility for inspecting system data structures by itself. This was a grey area where I chose to include dwarves in base but to satisfy its build dependency (cmake) from external sources, in this case, the cmake project provides prebuilt binaries.\n A repository ( monorepo) of all components shipped. Not such a good idea because of fighting autotooled builds and timestamps, see  Living with CVS in Autoconfiscated Projects. But it makes tracking changes in the distro easy which is more important for me.\n It is safe to assume that I\u2019ve run configure, make, make install a bunch of times with  CFLAGS set to \u2018 -fno-omit-framepointer -g\u2018 or some variation of (such as you have to enable optimisation also for build glibc otherwise it fails).\n Viewpoint is an inovationless distro, see previous point (there are no new methods or tooling on offering, just stock components from upstream built a certain way with differing flags)\n  Mercurial for source repo (because one piece of Linusware at a time).  There is a git mirror.\n Primarily intended for use as a guest vm though it is possible to install on hardware, the distinction here is because nothing has been done to cater for differing hardware in the kernel config so manual intervention may be required to prep and get everything working e.g it booted fine on my ThinkPad x230 but I had no wifi. There is also no UEFI support currently, nor any additional firmware included.\n Development of features to 3rd party components happen outside of the tree (because it\u2019s inovationless)\n Patches from LFS have not been applied, again because inovationless e.g their provided i18n patches to coreutils which are marked as rejected by upstream. The LFS guide  states \u201cIn the past, many bugs were found in this patch. When reporting new bugs to Coreutils maintainers, please check first if they are reproducible without this patch.\u201d\n Versioning is going to be a sequencing number meaning nothing beyond an indication of a new release\n Viewpoint doesn\u2019t follow the  FHS spec strictly &amp;  LSB at all. Perl &amp; Python are not part of base (because I did not want to maintain them in base).\n Currently intended to be used alongside  Brendan Gregg\u2018s  BPF Performance Tools book and  Diomidis Spinellis\u2018  Effective Debugging book for learning two different debugging workflows. Other texts are in mind for accomodation in the future. Would liked to have included DTrace but that currently requires running a fork of the kernel. While the fork is kept up to the date with upstream, as part of being inovationless, it is easier to swap components fresh from upstream and saves on having to eliminate another avenue where an issue could have been introduced when debugging problems.\n  Source repository is currently 5.1GB (1.8GB .hg directory, 3.3GB of source), 1.8GB .hg/git conversion directory, so as you can tell, that\u2019s a lot of value add \ud83d\ude42 . On deciding whether to strip components down to the essential minimum I opted not to as running test suites is part of the LFS workflow when building things up and it would make CI integration easier. AMD Firmware included in Linux aside, the test suites from GCC and Binutils for example take up the most space in the repo.\n Lots todo to smooth things over but some key features that I intend to work on to include in a future release\n Build framework to automate the configure, make, make install routine and allow customisation with ease ala BSDs. There is a framework in LFS project called  ALFS but I didn\u2019t want to go down the literate programming route and maintain my own fork of the LFS guide (you feed it the XML source of the guide and it builds the distro from that).\n  I listened to a lot Alan Kay lectures (a nod to  Viewpoints Research,  ViewPoint OS from Xerox, though this distro is in no way a great feat in achievement)\n

Times bought 60 inches of Subway tuna sandwiches from three different Subway locations in Los Angeles.\n A reporter for the newspaper then removed and froze the tuna and sent it to an unidentified commercial food testing lab. The newspaper said it paid roughly $500 for the lab to conduct a PCR test to see if the substance had one of five different tuna species.\n  After a month, the lab said it found \u201cno amplifiable tuna DNA was present in the sample and so we obtained no amplification products from the DNA.\u201d\n  Elaborating on the results, a spokesperson for the lab told\u00a0the Times that there were two different conclusions.\n \u201cOne, it\u2019s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out, we couldn\u2019t make an identification,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOr we got some and there\u2019s just nothing there that\u2019s tuna.\u201d\n Subway declined to comment to the Times on the lab results.\u00a0 The Hill has reached out to the company.\n The Times noted that the Food and Drug Administration identifies 15 species of nomadic saltwater fish that can be labeled \u201ctuna.\u201d\n The test comes as Subway faces a class-action lawsuit alleging that its tuna sandwich is not actually made of tuna. The suit was first filed in a California federal court in January.\n In an amended complaint\u00a0  dated June 7, the plaintiffs allege that Subway claims to sell sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna but was instead selling \u201canything less than healthy stocks.\u201d\n  Subway has been \u201cselling and continuing to sell some mixture that is deceptively and dishonestly being passed off as in line with their representations to purchasers but are not actually compliant,\u201d the suit states.\n Inside Edition did   its own test\u00a0of the tuna sandwich in February, in which it had a Florida-based lab test sandwiches from three Subway locations in New York. That test confirmed that tuna was in the sandwiches.\n Subway maintained in an email to the Times that it &#34;delivers 100 percent cooked tuna to its restaurants, which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches, wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:45:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c,tuna", "title": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u5730\u94c1\u7684\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7cDNA ", "title_en": "NY Times test finds no identifiable tuna DNA in Subway's tuna sandwich", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/559745-nyt-test-finds-zero-tuna-dna-in-subways-tuna-sandwich", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c", "tuna"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "691659c56da0c02cf0d3c5eb2ca6a4a9.jpeg", "infoid": 1067639, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5b98\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u91cc\uff0c\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u5bf9\u5979\u7684\u751f\u547d\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u5173\u7403\u8ff7\u8d28\u7591\u6cd5\u9662\u5982\u4f55\u7ee7\u7eed\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5979\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7167\u987e\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5979\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u6f14\u6d41\u884c\u660e\u661f\u3002\n \u5979\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u6cbb\u7684\u4eba\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u7a33\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4e\u70b9\u6551\u51fa\u4e86\u5979\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5979\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5979\u53ef\u4ee5\u642c\u5230\u5b83\u3002\n    \u4f46\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6cd5\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77db\uff0c39\uff0c\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5bf9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u8868\u793a\u4e25\u91cd\u53cd\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf4\u5b83\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5979\u65e5\u671f\u4e3a\u5979\u53a8\u623f\u989c\u8272\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u6a71\u67dc\u3002\n \u201c\u5979\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5979\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u7edf\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5979\u7684\u538b\u8feb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u201d\u57282016\u5e74\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u5979\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u7684\u6cd5\u5ead\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5199\u9053\u3002\u6839\u636e\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5bf9\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u201c\u592a\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u3002 \u201c\u592a\u8fc7\u5206\u4e86\uff01\u201d\n \u77db\u901a\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\uff0c\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u5b88\u515a\u5c3d\u5feb\u7ec8\u6b62\u3002 \u201c\u5979\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u88ab\u5e26\u8d70\u7684\u4f18\u52bf'\uff0c\u5979\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u8d5a\u94b1\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u5979\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff0c\u201d\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5199\u9053\u3002\n 2019\u5e74\uff0c\u77db\u961f\u544a\u8bc9\u6cd5\u9662\uff0c\u5979\u66fe\u611f\u5230\u8feb\u4f7f\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u9677\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u536b\u751f\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdd\u80cc\u5979\u7684\u610f\u5fd7\u3002\n \u5728\u6b4c\u624b\u7684\u638c\u8235\u5904\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u662f\u5979\u66fe\u7ecf\u662f\u5979\u66fe\u7ecf\u758f\u8fdc\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u5f6d\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u3002\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u6770\u7c73\u7684\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u4e8e2008\u5e74\u88ab\u4efb\u547d\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\u515a\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u516c\u5171\u6597\u4e89\u548c\u6697\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u540d\u516c\u5171\u6597\u4e89\u548c\u8650\u5f85\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u77db\u5728\u4e24\u53ea\u4e0d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u88ab\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u4e24\u540d\u4e0d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3002 \n\u65b0\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u77db\u5df2\u547c\u5401\u63d0\u95ee\u4ed6\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u3002\u65e9\u57282014\u5e74\uff0c\u5728\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a\u4e0a\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u516c\u4f17\uff0c\u77db\u961f\u4efb\u547d\u7684\u5f8b\u5e08\u585e\u7f2a\u5c14D.

", "note_en": "In the years since a judge gave the father of Britney Spears broad control over her life and finances, concerned fans have questioned how the court could continue to deem her unable to protect and care for herself despite the fact that she was still a performing pop star.\n Her father and others involved in the conservatorship maintained that it was a smooth-running machine that had rescued her from a low point and benefited Spears, and that she could move to end it whenever she wanted.\n    But now, confidential court records obtained by The New York Times reveal that Spears, 39, expressed serious opposition to the conservatorship earlier and more often than had previously been known, and said that it restricted everything from whom she dated to the color of her kitchen cabinets.\n \u201cShe articulated she feels the conservatorship has become an oppressive and controlling tool against her,\u201d a court investigator assigned to her case wrote in a 2016 report. The system had \u201ctoo much control,\u201d Spears said, according to the investigator\u2019s account of the conversation. \u201cToo, too much!\u201d\n Spears informed the investigator that she wanted the conservatorship terminated as soon as possible. \u201cShe is \u2018sick of being taken advantage of\u2019 and she said she is the one working and earning her money but everyone around her is on her payroll,\u201d the investigator wrote.\n In 2019, Spears told the court that she had felt forced by the conservatorship into a stay at a mental health facility and to perform against her will.\n At the helm of the singer\u2019s life and finances for most of that time was her once-estranged father, James P. Spears. James Spears, known as Jamie, was appointed conservator in 2008, shortly after Spears was placed in two involuntary psychiatric holds amid a series of public struggles and concerns around her mental health and substance abuse.\n  The newly obtained court records show that Spears has called into question his fitness for the role. As early as 2014, in a hearing closed to the public, Spears\u2019 court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, said his client wanted to explore the removal of her father as conservator, citing his drinking, among other objections she had raised in what he called a \u201cshopping list\u201d of grievances.\n Last year, Ingham brought these issues to the fore, telling the judge that Spears was \u201cafraid of her father,\u201d who remains a steward of her nearly $60 million fortune.\n On Wednesday, Spears is scheduled to address the Los Angeles court directly \u2014 a rare move she requested on an expedited basis. It is unclear whether her remarks will be made in public, but her relationship with her father is expected to be a central topic.\n Representatives for Jamie Spears, 68, declined to comment, citing the pending court hearing. But they have previously said the conservatorship was necessary to protect Spears from exploitation and harm and that Jamie Spears has been a dutiful father, acting out of love for his daughter.\n \u201cAny time Britney wants to end her conservatorship, she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it; she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,\u201d Vivian Lee Thoreen, a lawyer for Jamie Spears, said in a statement to People earlier this year. \u201cBritney knows that her Daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been \u2014 conservatorship or not.\u201d\n Theirs has long been a difficult and dysfunctional relationship, according to the court records and interviews with many people who know the family. But that dynamic grew even more complicated after Jamie Spears \u2014 a recovering alcoholic who has faced accusations of physical and verbal abuse \u2014 took the lead in wrestling what he saw as his adult daughter\u2019s demons.\n Spears said her father was \u201cobsessed\u201d with her in the sense that he wanted to control everything about her, according to the investigator\u2019s report. She could not make friends without his approval.\n Even as she earned millions from a successful Las Vegas residency, she said she was limited to a $2,000 weekly allowance, according to the records.\n Any mistakes resulted in \u201cvery harsh\u201d consequences, Spears added, according to the report. The conservatorship \u201ccomes with a lot of fear,\u201d she said.\n After consulting with Spears, her conservators and her doctors, the probate investigator concluded in 2016 that the conservatorship remained in Spears\u2019 best interests based on her complex finances, susceptibility to undue influence and \u201cintermittent\u201d drug issues, though the report called for \u201ca pathway to independence and the eventual termination of the conservatorship.\u201d\n The records provide only an incomplete snapshot of Spears\u2019 sentiments and situation throughout a 13-year saga. Still, they present in great detail her discontent with the arrangement, in particular her concerns that her views about her father and his own behaviors were not being appropriately considered.\n Experts say conservatorships should prioritize the wishes of the conservatee and help them regain their independence. The arrangements are supposed to be a last resort for people who cannot take care of their basic needs, such as those with significant disabilities or older people with dementia, yet Spears has been able to perform and profit for more than a decade.\n  What the court records make clear is that the battle over the conservatorship is rooted in the family\u2019s troubled history.\n Debbie Sanders Cross, Jamie Spears\u2019 first wife, who remains his friend, said his own \u201cvery difficult upbringing\u201d had influenced his perspective. \u201cI really think that\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to be so protective of Britney,\u201d she said.\n Jamie Spears had spent much of his life in Kentwood, a tiny Louisiana town where he was a star quarterback. His father, a boilermaker, was strict and demanding. \u201cHis daddy was so hard on him, but Jamie loved him and respected him,\u201d Jamie Spears\u2019 former football coach, Elton Shaw, recalled.\n Jamie Spears\u2019 youth was marked by tragedy: His mother died by suicide on the grave of her infant son when Jamie Spears was 13, according to the local paper. Jamie Spears survived a car accident that killed a football teammate four years later. At 22, he was arrested on drug and driving while intoxicated charges, according to a news report.\n When Lynne Spears, his second wife and Britney\u2019s mother, filed for divorce in 1980, she requested a temporary restraining order, citing a fear that he would \u201cbecome angry when he is served with these papers\u201d and harass or harm her, \u201cespecially if he has been drinking alcoholic beverages, as he has done in the past.\u201d\n The couple reconciled, but Jamie Spears\u2019 instability haunted Spears\u2019 childhood, the family has said. In her 2008 memoir, Lynne Spears recalled years of \u201cverbal abuse, abandonment\u201d and \u201cerratic behavior.\u201d\n The family struggled financially, and in 1998, just months before the release of Spears\u2019 blockbuster first album, the Spearses filed for bankruptcy. The couple divorced in 2002. Spears said later that it was the \u201cbest thing that ever happened to our family.\u201d\n Jamie Spears was present only intermittently during his daughter\u2019s rise to pop stardom. In 2004, according to a court filing, he went to rehab for alcoholism at the urging of his daughter.\n But by 2007, Spears was struggling herself. Humiliation by the press, stalking by the paparazzi, speculation around her mental health and substance abuse and a custody battle over her two young sons helped lead Spears to a breaking point.\n Jamie Spears reappeared for what he and his ex-wife, Lynne Spears, viewed as an urgent rescue mission.\n Along with his business manager, Louise M. Taylor, he prayed and fasted before he petitioned a judge for a temporary conservatorship of Spears, Lynne Spears wrote in her memoir. Taylor later became a business manager of Spears\u2019 estate and an architect of her comeback.\n The singer stressed that she did not want her father in charge, a lawyer she consulted at the time has said. But the judge overseeing the case, Reva Goetz, deemed Spears incapable of hiring her own counsel and appointed Ingham, the lawyer who represents her to this day.\n In February 2008, according to court records, Goetz deemed Jamie Spears \u201ca suitable and qualified person\u201d and granted him broad control over his daughter\u2019s daily life and, alongside a co-conservator, her finances.\n \u201cEverything he does, he feels is in the best interest of his daughters and his family,\u201d said Mitch Covington, a friend of Jamie Spears\u2019.\n Spears quickly went back to work. Within a year of being deemed unable to care for herself, she guest-starred on national television, released a No. 1 album and was preparing to embark on a run of almost 100 shows around the world.\n Aside from his salary as conservator \u2014 now about $16,000 per month, plus $2,000 a month for office space rent \u2014 Jamie Spears was approved by the court to receive a percentage of various deals signed for his daughter.\n In 2011, he received a 2.95% commission for his work on Spears\u2019 successful Femme Fatale tour. And in 2014, he was granted 1.5% of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to her Las Vegas residency, \u201cPiece of Me,\u201d which went on to earn a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows.\n The dual role of looking out for Spears\u2019 best interests as conservator and reaping more profits each time she performed was \u201cfraught with conflict,\u201d according to W. Michael Hensley, a probate lawyer in California who works as a fee examination expert and is not involved in the Spears case.\n  Court records reveal Spears\u2019 concerns that her father was hardly the person to be setting, and enforcing, the rules that governed her life.\n Spears\u2019 first tour under the conservatorship, The Circus Starring Britney Spears, was designed to be a dry one, with cast and crew forbidden from drinking alcohol \u2014 or even energy drinks \u2014 around Spears, according to three people who worked on it.\n During this period, a former nanny and housekeeper for Spears claimed Jamie Spears engaged in \u201cverbal abuse, tirades, inappropriate behavior and alcoholic relapses,\u201d according to a legal letter sent in 2010 that threatened a lawsuit.\n In 2014, Ingham told the court that Spears believed her father was drinking, according to a transcript of the closed hearing. Lawyers representing the conservatorship responded that Jamie Spears had voluntarily submitted to regularly scheduled alcohol tests and never failed. Jamie Spears\u2019 lawyer said he took one random test, but refused to take any more, calling the request inappropriate.\n \u201cAbsolutely inappropriate,\u201d the judge replied. \u201cAnd who is she to be demanding that of anybody?\u201d\n Ingham told the court that his client was upset that it was not taking her concerns seriously. \u201cShe said to me, when she gave me this shopping list, that she anticipates that, as it has been done before, the court will simply sweep it under the carpet and ignore any negative inferences with regard to Mr. Spears,\u201d Ingham said, according to a transcript.\n Ingham also raised Spears\u2019 urgent desire to terminate the conservatorship altogether. She had even mentioned the possibility of changing her lifestyle and retiring, but believed the conservatorship precluded that, he said, according to a transcript.\n In response to Spears\u2019 request to end the arrangement, the judge said that if she established a healthy relationship with a therapist and returned one year\u2019s worth of clean drug tests, she would take the matter under consideration. But she would not guarantee it.\n Those gathered, including the judge and lawyers on both sides, raised the possibility that Spears\u2019 boyfriend was provoking her discontent.\n  In 2016, Spears released her ninth studio album and performed more than 50 times in Las Vegas. But in private, she was again protesting the conservatorship, according to a report written by a probate investigator. (In California conservatorships, a court investigator is tasked with conducting periodic reviews for the judge.)\n Spears told the investigator that she was \u201cvery angry\u201d about the way her life was being run, and described security around her at all times. She was also being tested for drugs numerous times weekly, and her credit card was held by her security team or assistant and used at their discretion, the report said.\n Spears wanted to make cosmetic changes to her home, like re-staining her kitchen cabinets, she told the investigator, but was forbidden by her father, who told her too much money was being spent.\n The public image of Spears\u2019 life gave little sense of the turmoil she was expressing privately. An Instagram feed presented her as playfully approachable, and a new, lucrative Las Vegas show was set to begin in February 2019.\n Then, a month before the opening, Spears announced an \u201cindefinite work hiatus,\u201d canceling the residency. Jamie Spears had \u201calmost died\u201d after suffering a ruptured colon, according to a statement, which noted the pair\u2019s \u201cvery special relationship.\u201d\n That spring, Spears appeared at a closed-door hearing and read a statement. According to a transcript, she asserted that she had been forced into a mental health facility against her will on exaggerated grounds, which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself and making an objection during a rehearsal.\n She also claimed she had been forced to perform while sick with a 104-degree fever, calling it one of the scariest moments of her life.\n Spears ran down a list of her recent accomplishments, including tours and album releases. She told those present there was nothing wrong with her.\n A transcript of the hearing was mistakenly unsealed, and portions were first reported by TMZ.\n That summer brought further tumult. In August, there was an alleged physical altercation between Jamie Spears and Spears\u2019 13-year-old son. No charges were filed in the incident, but the child\u2019s father, Kevin Federline, was granted a restraining order barring Jamie Spears from seeing the children.\n Two weeks later, Jamie Spears, citing health problems, temporarily stepped down from his position as conservator of Spears\u2019 person and was replaced by a licensed professional. He remained in control of Spears\u2019 money.\n By September 2020, a flurry of courtroom activity indicated publicly that something had shifted. Ingham filed court papers saying that Spears \u201cis vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret.\u201d\n Ingham then filed complaints about the ways Jamie Spears managed the singer\u2019s money, asserting that he paid excessive fees of over $300,000 to the firm of her then-business manager, Taylor. (In court, a lawyer for Jamie Spears called the fees reasonable.)\n As the fight drags on, the bills are piling up \u2014 and, in a quirk of the conservatorship system, Spears has to pay for lawyers on both sides, including those arguing against her wishes in court. A recent $890,000 bill from one set of Jamie Spears\u2019 lawyers, covering about four months of work, included media strategizing for defending the conservatorship.\n At a public court hearing in November, Spears\u2019 mother moved to support the removal of Jamie Spears as conservator. Through a lawyer, she called the father-daughter relationship \u201ctoxic\u201d and said it was \u201ctime to start fresh,\u201d adding that Jamie Spears had referred to his daughter as \u201ca racehorse who has to be handled like one.\u201d\n That day, Judge Brenda Penny, who had replaced Goetz on the case, declined a request from Ingham to suspend Jamie Spears immediately, but left the door open to consider removing him in the future. Penny approved a wealth management firm to serve as co-conservator of the estate alongside Jamie Spears.\n  Jamie Spears has recently been back home in Kentwood, where he is known to host crawfish boils and stop by the town\u2019s Veterans of Foreign Wars bar. But he mostly keeps to himself. \u201cHe is just the same old Jamie,\u201d his former football coach, Shaw, said.\n Jamie Spears recently sold the house Spears grew up in. He has been staying down a winding country road on the outskirts of town, in a recreational vehicle parked at a warehouse that has stored the boxed-up relics of his daughter\u2019s megawatt career.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:45:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ed3\u675f,spears,\u5f8b\u5e08", "title": "\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u6084\u7136\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u7ed3\u675f\u5979\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00\u4f53 ", "title_en": "Britney Spears Quietly Pushed for Years to End Her Conservatorship", "transed": 1, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/britney-spears-quietly-pushed-years-190423835.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ed3\u675f", "spears", "\u5f8b\u5e08"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "091d9e1d1cd042c838ecf8101bfefe96.jpg", "infoid": 1067638, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u4f20\u67d3\u6027Delta\u53d8\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u8d1f\u8d23\u7f8e\u56fd\u6bcf\u4e94\u4e2aCovid-19\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5728\u5468\u4e8c\u7684\u536b\u751f\u5b98\u5458\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e24\u5468\u5185\u7ffb\u4e86\u4e00\u756a\u3002\n \u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\uff0cDelta\u662f\u75be\u75c5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u536b\u751f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u201c\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u201d\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u8fc5\u901f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\n \u5b83\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\u968f\u7740\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u6ef4\u7b54\u4f5c\u54cd\u548ccovid-19\u6848\u4f8b\u6570\u843d\u4e0b\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u95ee\u9898delta\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u8fc5\u901f\u5d1b\u8d77\u4fc3\u4f7f\u62c5\u5fc3\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5371\u53ca\u56fd\u5bb6\u5728\u51fb\u8d25\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\n \u201c\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\u53d8\u5f02\u76ee\u524d\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u6d88\u9664Covid-19\uff0c\u201d\u5168\u56fd\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u4e13\u5bb6Anthony S.

variant of the coronavirus is now responsible for about one in every five Covid-19 cases in the United States, and its prevalence has doubled in the last two weeks, health officials said on Tuesday.\n First identified in India, Delta is one of several \u201c variants of concern,\u201d as designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. It has spread rapidly through India and Britain.\n Its appearance in the United States is not surprising. And with vaccinations ticking up and Covid-19 case numbers falling, it\u2019s unclear how much of a problem Delta will cause here. Still, its swift rise has prompted concerns that it might jeopardize the nation\u2019s progress in beating back the pandemic.\n \u201cThe Delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate Covid-19,\u201d Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, said at the briefing. The good news, he said, is that the vaccines authorized in the United States work against the variant. \u201cWe have the tools,\u201d he said. \u201cSo let\u2019s use them, and crush the outbreak.\u201d\n Delta, formerly known as B.1.617.2, is believed to be the most transmissible variant yet, spreading more easily than both the original strain of the virus and the Alpha variant first identified in Britain. Public health officials there have said that Delta could be  50 percent more contagious than Alpha, though precise estimates of its infectiousness vary.\n Other evidence suggests that the variant may be able to partially evade the antibodies made by the body after a coronavirus infection or vaccination. And the variant may also render certain monoclonal antibody treatments less effective,  the C.D.C. notes.\n Delta  may also cause more severe illness. A  recent Scottish study, for instance, found that people infected by the Delta variant were roughly twice as likely to be hospitalized than were those infected with Alpha. But uncertainties remain, scientists said.\n \u201cThe severe disease piece I think is the one question that really hasn\u2019t been answered yet,\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n  Delta has been reported in  80 countries. It is now the most common variant in India and Britain, where it accounts for  more than 90 percent of cases.\n Delta was first identified in the United States in March. Although Alpha remains the most prevalent variant here, Delta has spread quickly. In early April, Delta represented just 0.1 percent of cases in the United States,  according to the C.D.C. By early May, the variant accounted for 1.3 percent of cases, and by early June, that figure had jumped to 9.5 percent. As of a few days ago, the estimate hit 20.6 percent, Dr. Fauci said at the briefing.\n  The Delta variant is unlikely to pose much risk to people who have been fully vaccinated, experts said.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re fully vaccinated, I would largely not worry about it,\u201d said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n According to one recent study, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88 percent effective at protecting against symptomatic disease caused by Delta, nearly matching its 93 percent effectiveness against the Alpha variant. But a single dose of the vaccine was just 33 percent effective against Delta, the study found.\n \u201cFully immunized individuals should do well with this new phase of the epidemic,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cHowever, the protection offered by a single dose appears low, and of course if you are not at all vaccinated, consider yourself at high risk.\u201d\n What to Know :  Shortages of oxygen\u00a0and hospital beds, along with  low vaccination rates, have added to the surge in illness and deaths in India.\n Case Counts: \u00a0Experts say the  true death count far exceeds official figures. This chart illustrates  how known Covid cases\u00a0have grown over the last few months across the country.\n Travel Bans:\u00a0The U.S. has begun to restrict travel from India, and  Australia has banned all incoming travel from the country,\u00a0including among its own citizens.\n How to Help:\u00a0Donors around the world are giving money for meals, medical expenses, P.P.E. and oxygen tanks, among other essential supplies.\n   The pandemic is waning in the United States, with cases, hospitalizations and deaths all on the decline. The seven-day case average, roughly 10,350 a day, is the lowest since March 2020, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the C.D.C., said at the briefing on Tuesday. \u201cThese numbers demonstrate the extraordinary progress we\u2019ve made against a formidable foe,\u201d she said.\n So while Delta may account for an increasing percentage of cases, it is not yet clear whether it will drive the total number of cases higher.\n \u201cI think we are not going to see another big, national surge in the United States because we have enough vaccination to prevent that,\u201d Dr. Osterholm said.\n Still, vaccination rates have been highly uneven, and are lower in certain states and demographic groups. Delta could fuel outbreaks in the South,  where vaccinations lag, or  among young people, who are less likely to be vaccinated than their elders.\n \u201cIn places where there\u2019s still a lot of susceptibility to the virus, it opens a window for cases to start going up again,\u201d said Justin Lessler, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cBut even in those states, and certainly nationally, we\u2019re probably not getting back to the numbers we were seeing last winter.\u201d\n Still, he said, it could prolong our path out of the pandemic. \u201cIt continues the doldrums,\u201d he said.\n  Get vaccinated. If you\u2019re already vaccinated, encourage your family, friends and neighbors to get vaccinated. Vaccination is likely to slow the spread of all the variants and reduce the odds that new, even more dangerous variants emerge.\n \u201cI encourage people who are vaccinated to trust in the vaccines but be cognizant that new variants will continue to occur where transmission exists,\u201d said Saskia Popescu, an infectious disease epidemiologist at George Mason University. \u201cSo it\u2019s really about ensuring local, national and global vaccination.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:44:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,delta,\u53d8\u4f53", "title": "Covid\u7684Delta Variant\uff1a\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u77e5\u9053\u4ec0\u4e48 ", "title_en": "Covid's Delta Variant: What Scientists Know", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/health/delta-variant-covid.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "delta", "\u53d8\u4f53"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "-  3\u82af\u7247\u6a21\u62df\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u75284 NV\uff06\uff0334;

in a 74HC14 plus 2 x 74ALS240s as motor drivers and multiplexers.\n                - 5 multi-directional wire touch sensors (4 corners and 1 forward) and two phototropic eyes for light following ability.\n  - Nv &#34;Necklass Function&#34; processes could fall into 3 distinct patterns allowing it to rest, walk, and &#34;dig&#34;.\n    - Asymmetric control signals even mimicked a form of &#34;learning ability&#34; due to motor-load variations affecting process refractions in beneficial ways.\n      In Mark Tilden&#39;s first year as a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory he took advantage of formal time to apply his theories of minimalist biomorphic design, building a range of experimental insectoid robot platforms for scientific study.\u00a0 Following a New York Times interview in 1993 (covering Tilden&#39;s fame as organizer of the BEAM Robot Games that year), the reporter mentioned that the Times had dozens of broken Sony &#34;Walkman Professionals&#34; used to destruction, and they&#39;d be glad to send them along.\u00a0 About a dozen did show up which Tilden carefully dissected and used in a variety of first-generation research walkers.\u00a0 Walkman 1.5 was the most successful and certainly the most famous of the twelve-robot line, many of which were built concurrently over a 2 year period.\n    Knowing his Nervous Network control theory was robust enough to work anything, Tilden built his robots only from discarded components and in non-uniform ways to prove the point, and Walkman was no exception.\u00a0 The robot was built from a vast array of diverse components from the famous &#34;oven timer&#34; gearbox, Motorola phone vibrating motors, Walkman gearboxes and analog electronics, gold PCB test pins, and parts from old laser-printer cartridges, even the PCB the circuit was built on was scavenged from an 1980s Sun Microsystems video board.\u00a0 Indeed, there was nothing in the robot (as in the entire VBug series) that was not second hand.\u00a0 The entire robot was &#34;wire-framed&#34;, with solder as the primary structural element holding it together.\u00a0 Walkman and his brethren even garnered a Guinness World Record for &#34;World&#39;s Least Expensive Research Robot&#34; from 1997 to 2001.\n      Walkman standing on one of the extra walkmans donated by the reporters at the New York Times.\u00a0 The first Walkmans donated were used to build the robot itself.\n    Despite appearances nothing on Walkman was decorative -- sensors were all shaped to optimize object detection as the asymmetric robot explored, gold video-cable pins were used for contacts to optimize lifetime, even the aluminum backplate was used as a heat sink for the 240 bus driver chips (pushed well beyond their ratings as both motor drivers and multiplexers).\n    Walkman turned out to be the darling of Tilden and Hasslachers international lecture circuit from 1994 to 1999, showing how emergent competence could rise from simplicity (a stalwart of the Artificial Life movement during that time).\u00a0 During a lecture at the MIT Robotics Laboratory in 1995 the famous Marvin Minsky, after examining Walkman, put it down and exclaimed &#34;I don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve hidden the wireless modem link to the computer that&#39;s actually controlling this thing, but I know it has to be in there somewhere.&#34;\u00a0 Despite a long emotionally charged discussion afterwards, no opinions were changed despite experimental evidence and repeated tests.\n    In 1997 Walkman was taken to Washington DC for study and presentation by various science agencies to drum up funding interest in Biomorphic Robotics -- a &#34;new form&#34; of robotics that appeared capable but significantly less expensive than conventional methods.\u00a0 It was during this time that Walkman was found missing after a prominent presentation to congress having been lifted from a Capitol Hill exibition table without a trace.\u00a0 Walkman was gone for over 15 months until the fall of 1998 when it was returned to Tilden by a new DARPA Project manager who had &#34;found it&#34;

However, this is no ordinary external  SSD as the   XTRM-Q packs a whopping 16TB of storage space.\n  The new drive actually features dual 8TB NVMe SSDs inside an enclosure for 16TB in total. The size of the enclosure isn&#39;t too big as you can probably make out from the image above. It measures 4.5&#34; long, 2.56&#34; wide, and 0.68&#34; high. In terms of build, its body is made of aluminum that makes it strong and also helps to dissipate heat. This is important if it works as well as the company says since SSDs are generally more heat-sensitive than HDDs. There is also a rubbery case on top for further protection.\n Now coming to the drive itself, each 8TB drive inside the enclosure can be run individually or you can run them in RAID 0 mode for a total of 16TB of storage. When running RAID 0 mode, the speed of the drive will double providing up to 2800MB/s. For speeds like this, a reasonably fast interface is necessary. For that, the Sabrent Rocket    XTRM-Q comes with support for Intel Thunderbolt 3. A Thunderbolt cable is included along with a power adapter,\n  The Sabrent Rocket     XTRM-Q 16TB launches at a price of $2,899.99 and is available for purchase  on Amazon&#39;s US website.\n The     XTRM-Q isn&#39;t the only large-sized SSD that Sabrent has been in news for as last year in December, the company said it was preparing a  SATA 16TB internal 2.5&#34; SSD.", "posttime": "2021-06-23

", "note_en": "Just before the long weekend at the end of May, Amazon announced the release of their   Sidewalk mesh network . There are many misconceptions about what it is and what it does, so this article will untangle some of the confusion.\n  Much of the press about Amazon Sidewalk has said that it will force you to share your internet or WiFi network. It won\u2019t. It\u2019s a network to connect home automation devices like smart light switches together in more flexible ways.\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is opening the network up to partners, the first of which is the Tile tracker.\n Sidewalk can use the internet for some features, but won\u2019t in general. If it does, Amazon is limiting its rate to 80 kilobits per second -- or 8 kilobytes per second, which is only about 50% more than the modems we used in the old days. It is also capped at 500 MB per month, which is less than two hours of 80 kbps over the whole month. To be clear: it isn\u2019t going to interfere with your streaming, video calls, or anything else. The   average web page is over two megabytes  in size, which would take over four minutes to download at that speed.\n  Sidewalk is primarily a mesh network for home automation devices, like Alexa\u2019s smart device features, Google Home, and Apple HomeKit. This mesh network can provide coverage where your home network is flaky. To build the ecosystem, people incorporate their devices into this mesh network.\n The first partner company to integrate to Sidewalk is the   Tile tracker tags . Sidewalk allows you to use a Tile tag at a distance further than typical Bluetooth range. Sidewalk uses Bluetooth, WiFi, and 900MHz radio to connect the mesh network together. There will be other partner companies; this is an important thing to understand about the Amazon Sidewalk mesh, that it\u2019s not just Amazon. Other companies will make devices that operate as entities in the network, either as a device like a smart light switch, or as a hub like the Echo and Ring devices.\n  Suppose you want to send a birthday card to Alice, I live next door to you, and you know I work with Alice. Rather than sending the card through the postal system, you might give me the card to take to Alice. When I get to work, I run into Bob who sits next to Alice, so I give the card to Bob, who gives it to Alice.\n That\u2019s a mesh network.\u00a0 A web of people delivers the message in an ad hoc manner, and saves you postage. Notably, mesh networks work without explicit infrastructure or servers.\n  Suppose you put an Alexa-controlled light in your bedroom, but the WiFi there is flaky. If you use Alexa to turn the light on or off, sometimes the command doesn\u2019t get through. Let\u2019s also suppose that in that bedroom, the WiFi from your neighbor\u2019s house is stronger than your WiFi. Well, what if when your WiFi doesn\u2019t process your command, your Alexa uses your neighbor\u2019s WiFi instead? That\u2019s what Amazon Sidewalk does, with a very simple mesh, from your Alexa to your neighbor\u2019s WiFi to your light.\n Let\u2019s expand on that example. Suppose that you\u2019re out on a walk in your neighborhood and realize you didn\u2019t turn your lamp off. You press a button on your smartphone to turn the lamp off. Your phone passes that message to a nearby house, perhaps the one across the street, which hands that message to another house, and it ends up at your lamp, in much the same way as your birthday card made its way to Alice.\n In some situations, Sidewalk won\u2019t be able to route the message via the mesh. Instead, it has to send the message to the internet, and then back from the internet to the mesh network near the destination.\n The Sidewalk documents we have seen do not have details of the mesh routing algorithms, such as how messages are routed via mesh and when or why they go into or out of the internet. So we don\u2019t know how that works. We do know that when Sidewalk tries to send messages without involving the internet, messages are expected to be small, and relatively infrequent, because the bandwidth throttle and total data caps are someone\u2019s \u201cnobody should need anywhere close to this\u201d limits. We don\u2019t know how hard it tries, nor how successful its tries are.\n  Amazon describes the privacy and security of Sidewalk in a   privacy and security whitepaper .\u00a0Amazon also\u00a0has\u00a0 an overview,\u00a0  a blog post about their goals ,   an IoT Integration site , and   developer documentation for the SDK .\n While it does not describe the details of the Sidewalk protocols, its description of the cryptographic security and privacy measures is promising. So is the sketch of the routing. It appears to have some good security and privacy protections. Of course, the proof is in the details and ultimate implementation. Amazon has a reasonable track record of designing, building, and updating security and privacy in AWS and related technologies. It\u2019s in their interest to severely limit what participants in the mesh network learn about other participants, and thus whatever leaks researchers find are likely to be bugs.\n    Most of the articles about Sidewalk focused on the network sharing, without explaining that this is a community mesh network of home automation and related technologies. Even more recent articles, which at least have stopped talking about   internet  sharing, are instead talking about   wireless  (WiFi) sharing. It\u2019s been difficult to understand what Sidewalk is and is not. At the end of our investigation, we don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve gotten it right, either. Amazon needs to do a much better job telling us what their new systems do.\n To be fair, this is hard! Mesh networking is not widely used for wireless communications because the technology is difficult to implement. Nonetheless, this is all the more reason for Amazon to spend more time describing what Sidewalk is.\n  Amazon has published some good overviews, white papers, and even some API descriptions, yet there is much that we still don\u2019t know about Sidewalk. For example, we don\u2019t know the details of the security and privacy measures. Likewise, we don\u2019t know what the mesh routing algorithms are. Thus, there\u2019s no independent analysis of Sidewalk.\n Moreover, while we like the sketch of Sidewalk\u2019s security, there will be inevitable transfers of information to Amazon, such as IDs of devices on the new network. We don\u2019t know if there are other information transfers to participating devices, or things\u00a0Amazon can infer.\n  Even though the initial description of privacy and security show that care went into designing Sidewalk, it\u2019s a version-one system. So there are bugs in the protocol and the software. There also will be bugs yet to be written in Sidewalk-compatible devices and software made by Amazon and its partners. Being an early-adopter of any new technology has the benefit of being early, as well as the risks of being early.\n  While Sidewalk has been designed for security and privacy, it has not been designed to mitigate abuse. This is a glaring hole.\n Amazon\u2019s whitepaper for Sidewalk describes a use case of a lost pet. The first Sidewalk partner is the Tile tracker. While we all empathize with someone whose pet is missing, and we\u2019ve all wondered where we left our keys, any system that allows one to track a pet allows one to be a stalker. So Sidewalk creates new opportunities for people to stalk family members, former romantic partners, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and others. Just drop a tracker in their handbag or car, and you can track them.   This has been our main criticism of Sidewalk, and to be fair, Tile says they are working on solutions .   This has also been our criticism of Apple\u2019s AirTags .\u00a0 Sidewalk amplifies the existing risk of a surreptitious tracker by giving it the extended reach of every Echo or Ring camera that\u2019s participating in the Sidewalk network. If Sidewalk systems don\u2019t have proper controls on them then estranged spouses, ex-roommates, and nosy neighbors, can use them to spy from anywhere in the world.\n We also are concerned about how Amazon might connect its new Sidewalk technology to one of its most controversial products:   Ring   home   doorbell   surveillance   cameras . For example, if Ring cameras are tied together through Sidewalk technology, they can form neighborhood-wide video surveillance systems.\n While Amazon\u2019s whitepapers indicate that the security and privacy is pretty good,\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is silent on these kinds of abuse scenarios. Indeed, their pet use case is a proxy for abuse. We are concerned that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know about the overall ecosystem.\n  Perhaps the most important principle in respectful design is user consent. People must be free to autonomously choose whether or not to use a technology, and whether or not another entity may process their personal information. Opt-in systems have far lower participation than opt-out systems, because most people either are not aware of the system and its settings, or don\u2019t take the time to change the settings.\n Thus, defaults matter. By making Sidewalk opt-out instead of opt-in, Amazon is ginning up a wider reach of its network, at the cost of genuine user control of their own technologies.\n In Sidewalk\u2019s case, there might be a relatively low infosec cost to a person being pushed into the system until they opt-out. The major risk is the effect of bugs in the system. It\u2019s low risk, but not no risk.\n If Amazon had made its new system opt-in, we might not be writing about it at all. It would have traded slower growth for fewer complaints.\n  If you\u2019ve decided after reading this that you don\u2019t want to use Sidewalk, it\u2019s easy to turn off.\n Amazon has a page with instructions on how to turn Sidewalk off.  If you do not use Alexa, Echo, or Ring, you won\u2019t be using Sidewalk at all, so you don\u2019t have to worry about turning it off.\n  Amazon\u2019s Sidewalk system is a mesh network that uses their Echo devices and Ring cameras to improve the reach and reliability of their home automation systems and partner systems like Tile\u2019s tracker. It is not an internet sharing system as some have reported. Its design appears to be privacy-friendly and to have good security. It is a brand-new system, so there will be bugs in it.\n The major problem is a lack of mitigations to stop people from using it in abusive ways, such as tracking another person. It is also troubling that Amazon foisted the system on its users, placing on them the burden of opting out, rather than respecting its users\u2019 autonomy and giving the opportunity to opt-in.",

With the fresh capital, Joyride will double down on its ability to help local operators find and finance  the right vehicles, access insurance programs from trusted partners and learn how to deploy a profitable fleet. Joyride has already offered these services to an extent alongside its SaaS business model, but wants to feature them more prominently as its business grows.\n \u201cReally early on in the pandemic, we saw companies like Bird and Lime pull out of almost every market they were in, and then almost right away we started to get a lot of local entrepreneurs from those cities contacting us and saying, \u2018Hey, Bird and Lime just left. I see a real opportunity here for me to run a micromobility business for myself,\u2019\u201d Joyride\u2019s founder and CEO Vince Cifani told TechCrunch.\n  Since last year, Joyride has seen interest from entrepreneurs looking to start small scooter and e-bike share businesses increase four-fold compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Cifani said. That looks like about 150 requests per week. Joyride\u2019s stats point to an emerging trend of local operators beginning to spring up in the parts of the world perhaps deemed too small fry for the big operators.\n Over the last couple of years, the industry seems to have been on the consolidation path, especially when we look at acquisitions like  Lime buying Jump and  Boosted and Bird buying  Circ and  Scoot. But we haven\u2019t really seen consolidation among the hundreds of smaller businesses operating locally, said Cifani. And while they may be small individually, they\u2019re mighty in numbers, quietly cropping up in towns and cities across the globe and privately at hotels and on campuses. In some cases, like with The Hague in the Netherlands, fleets are being operated by public transit.\n As local operators proliferate, the opportunity for companies like Joyride grows. In Germany, a similar software provider   Wunder Mobility  recently launched a lending division to help micromobility startups finance fleets.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve identified that there are over 10,000 different markets for these types of local operators to run this type of business,\u201d said Cifani. \u201cSo if it\u2019s taken Bird, say, half a billion dollars to get into 100 plus markets, are they actually going to raise $100 billion to try and get into every single market opportunity in the world? The inflection point for us is that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for this long tail market, and we\u2019ve seen Bird try to pivot into that space as well with its fleet manager model.\u201d\n Under Bird\u2019s fleet manager model, which made up  94% of the company\u2019s \u201csharing\u201d revenue in the second half of 2020, the vehicles and software are supplied to local operators. Bird always maintains ownership and branding of the scooters. The fleet managers are responsible for fleet deployment and rebalancing, sanitization, and general care and maintenance of the Bird vehicles. In exchange, the operators receive a portion of the fee that users pay to rent the scooters.\n Joyride is different. The company helps customers buy fleets outright from manufacturing partners and in some cases helps them finance their vehicles.\n Where the big players like Bird and Lime have chased scale in the push to become profitable, Cifani says many of Joyride\u2019s operators running smaller operations tell him they\u2019ve paid back the money for all their vehicles within a few months.\n Joyride\u2019s seed round was led by Proeza Ventures, Urban Innovation Fund and Craig Miller, former CPO of Shopify, a platform that has similarly helped democratize the e-commerce space. Cifani says Joyride will be doing a Series A in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 11:38:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "software,\u8fd0\u8425\u5546", "title": "Micrococility Software\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546Joyride\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86370\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u79cd\u5b50 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMicromobility software provider Joyride raises $3.7 million seed round\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/micromobility-software-provider-joyride-raises-3-7-million-seed-round/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["software", "\u8fd0\u8425\u5546"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "314c4f2178fa7e14f3fd76e54b9d9774.jpg", "infoid": 1067629, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6765\u81eaMax Planck\u5206\u5b50\u690d\u7269\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u5373\u5a01\u5c14\u5bcc\u901a\u79d1\u5b66\u5927\u5b66\uff0cWeizmann\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u548c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u642c\u8fd0\u5de5\u5b66\u9662\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5236\u4f5c\u98df\u7269\u6bd4\u751f\u957f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5e84\u7a3c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u672c\u96c6\u56e2\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u79cd\u690d\u4f5c\u7269\uff08\u5927\u8c46\uff09\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u98df\u54c1 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u51e0\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u957f\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5;\u6765\u81ea\u7a7a\u6c14\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5c06\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u71c3\u6599\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u71c3\u6599\u8d44\u6e90\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea7\u751f\u98df\u7528\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u7ec6\u83cc\u4ea7\u751f\u98df\u7269\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u662f\u82ac\u5170\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u98df\u54c1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u57282023\u5e74\u4e4b\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u793a\u8303\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bd5\u56fe\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ece\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u751f\u957f\u98df\u7269\u7684\u4e3b\u98df\u4f5c\u7269\u5927\u8c46\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u98df\u54c1 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u9762\u677f\u6765\u5236\u4f5c\u7535\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6c14\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u79cd\u690d\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u751f\u4ea7\u98df\u7269\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e72\u71e5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e72\u71e5\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u4eba\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u7c89\u672b\u3002\n  \u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e10\u5e73\u65b9\u5343\u7c73\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u5730\u9762\u4e0a\u751f\u957f\u5927\u8c46\uff0c\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u98df\u7269\u589e\u957f10\u500d\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5efa\u8bae\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u768410\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79cd\u690d\u5927\u8c46\u7684\u571f\u5730\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u4e00\u5757\u571f\u5730\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u79cd\u690d\u98df\u7269\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e5d\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u8f6c\u52a8\u56de\u5230\u91ce\u751f\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u98df\u7269 - \u7a7a\u6c14\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5176\u4ed6\u4f5c\u7269\uff0c\u5982\u7389\u7c73\uff0c\u5c0f\u9ea6\u548c\u6c34\u7a3b\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\uff1aDorian Leger\u7b49\uff0c\u5149\u4f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u751f\u4ea7\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4\u4f5c\u7269\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u571f\u5730\u548c\u9633\u5149\uff0c\u5168\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u4f5c\u54c1\uff082021\u5e74\uff09\u3002 DOI\uff1a10.1073 / PNAS.2015025118 ", "note_en": "A team of researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, the University of Naples Federico II, the Weizmann Institute of Science and the Porter School of the Environment and Earth Sciences has found that making food from air would be far more efficient than growing crops. In their paper published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group describes their analysis and comparison of the efficiency of growing crops (soybeans) and using a food-from-air technique.    For several years, researchers around the world have been looking into the idea of growing &#34;  from air,&#34; combining a renewable fuel resource with carbon from the air to create food for a type of bacteria that create edible protein. One such project is Solar Foods in Finland, where researchers have the goal of building a demonstration plant by 2023. In this new effort, the researchers sought to compare the efficiency of growing a staple crop, soybeans, with growing food from air.\n  To make their comparisons, the researchers used a food-from-air system that uses solar energy panels to make electricity, which is combined with   from the air to produce food for microbes grown in a bioreactor. The protein the microbes produce is then treated to remove   and then dried to produce a powder suitable for consumption by humans and animals.\n  They compared the efficiency of the system with a 10-square-kilometer   field. Their analysis showed that growing food from air was 10 times as efficient as growing soybeans in the ground. Put another way, they suggested that a 10-square-kilometer piece of land in the Amazon used to grow soybeans could be converted to a one-square-kilometer piece of land for growing food from the air, with the other nine square kilometers turned back to wild forest growth. They also note that the protein produced using the food-from-air approach had twice the caloric value as most other crops such as corn, wheat and rice.

", "note_en": "Weirdly hard to define, much less to feel OK about it, pleasure is a tricky creature. Can philosophy help us lighten up?\n Over breakfast one April day in 1778, James Boswell asked Samuel Johnson why he gave up booze. Dr Johnson replied that he didn\u2019t like to lose power over himself, but assured his friend that he would one day drink again when he grew old (he was 68 at the time). Boswell replied: \u2018I think, Sir, you once said to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life.\u2019 To which Dr Johnson answered: \u2018It is a diminution of pleasure, to be sure; but I do not say a diminution of happiness. There is more happiness in being rational.\u2019\n It is a common notion, even in our own day, that pleasure is in some sense a distraction from happiness \u2013 or that it doesn\u2019t lead to the kind of happiness that  really matters. Pleasure, in and of itself, is \u2018lower\u2019 than the real heavy hitters, such as Truth and Virtue and Wisdom and God, those hallowed founts of  authentic happiness. It is universal \u2013 indeed inherent \u2013 that we humans are drawn to pleasure. Yet pleasure-seeking itself is often seen as an indulgence, and therefore rings with a kind of selfishness, even a kind of confusion. Pleasure doesn\u2019t last, the idea goes, but Truth does, or Rationality does, or Wisdom does, and so those are the things that we ought to seek.\n Whenever and wherever they are found, moralists and their dreary ilk often describe their own times as characterised by debauched hedonism. But does it accurately describe our time? Are we in the thrall of a love affair with pleasure? I don\u2019t think so. Even if more people are more comfortable than they used to be, it\u2019s still hard to admit to doing something pleasurable  just because it\u2019s pleasurable. More often, pleasure is excused as a little reward, a diversion, a break from the demands of the \u2018real world\u2019. Pleasure is something that will allow you to work harder, to catch your breath before returning to the turmoils of life. Searching for pleasure for pleasure\u2019s sake is an act tinged with shame and, when it\u2019s admitted to, excuses ought be made.\n Lord Byron gave our tense relationship with pleasure a memorable couplet: \u2018O pleasure! you\u2019re indeed a pleasant  thing / Although one must be damn\u2019d for you, no doubt.\u2019 Those who give in to pleasure have often been compared, unkindly, to animals. The Roman Stoic Epictetus told those who identified pleasure with goodness to go \u2018lead the life of a worm, of which you judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women, and ease yourself, and snore.\u2019 Friedrich Nietzsche located a being that, for him, was perhaps even lower than the worm: \u2018Man does not strive for pleasure,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018Only the Englishman does.\u2019\n This isn\u2019t true of all pleasures, however. The trouble for Dr Johnson, as he was quick to explain, was \u2018sensual pleasure. When a man says, he had pleasure with a woman, he does not mean conversation, but something of a very different nature.\u2019 (You can almost see the wink on his vast face.) The pleasures he disdains are the bodily pleasures, the ones we get from aged whisky and taking off your boots after a long hike. The pleasures that count, for Dr Johnson and for many other thinkers, are the pleasures of the mind. These are the pleasures that are pure, unmarred by the Earth. They\u2019re to be kept clean and separate from the pleasures of the body, which are for the lower sorts of people. Or, as Dr Johnson rather flatly put it: \u2018[T]he greatest part of men are gross.\u2019\n The purpose of this Guide is simple: I want to talk about some of the ways that people have thought about pleasure over the years. Pleasure is a surprisingly slippery idea, surprising because it seems so obvious what it is. But trying to actually nail it down is like nailing down a cloud. Regardless, that makes it more important to reflect on pleasure \u2013 its value, its nature, and the places that people have found it. My hope is that, by thinking through what pleasure is, by analysing and probing and querying it, perhaps you\u2019ll be more likely to find it in the places you least expect (but no promises, of course).\n Pleasure is everywhere and yet it\u2019s hard to work out quite what   it is\n The sheer variety of ways that people procure pleasure is unsettling, as well as a testament to the plasticity of our species. The differences can be small \u2013 I can\u2019t understand why people like to watch golf \u2013 and the differences can be great, especially across cultural and temporal gulfs \u2013 the pleasure people once got in attending the afternoon execution seems, to me, a  bit odd.\n Think of pleasure in your own life. What is common to all of the things that give you pleasure? The throughline between warm scarves and charity work and calling your grandmother; between the cool side of the pillow, the sad-happiness of nostalgia, the pop of a champagne bottle opening \u2013 what could it be other than that these are all, in their way, pleasing? So, the question is: if pleasure can be found in all these sundry ways, then what  is it? And the most common answer is a tad ho-hum: stuff that feels good. Stuff that you like. The experiences that make you say: \u2018Yep!  There  it is.\u2019\n Many philosophers have accepted this, or a version of it, and have taken it to mean that there\u2019s not a whole lot more to be said about the nature of pleasure (moralising about how others go about  getting pleasure, of course, is a different story). Pleasure is what it is. Its very heterogeneity, its inconceivable variety, has led many to conclude that it\u2019s an elementary component of our existence, or an absolutely simple experience. Edmund Burke said it was so simple it was \u2018incapable of definition\u2019. John Locke held that pleasure \u2018cannot be described \u2026 the way of knowing [pleasure] is \u2026 only by experience.\u2019\n This view of pleasure as unanalysable, it seems to me, makes the nature of pleasure even stranger given its ubiquity in our lives. Can it really just be, as William James held, that \u2018pleasures are generally associated with beneficial \u2026 experiences\u2019? Does  that definition truly exhaust pleasure? Maybe. When a significant number of philosophers, usually a loquacious bunch, throw up their hands and say that pleasure is too simple to describe, you know that the idea is an odd one. As Elizabeth Anscombe once wrote, the idea of pleasure even \u2018reduced Aristotle to sheer babble\u2019, and she was right, as far as I  can tell.\n Perhaps the problem, as so often, lies with language. Pleasure occupies a prime position in a very crowded constellation. Nearby, you\u2019ll find joy, delight, happiness, satisfaction and, perhaps a bit further on, ecstasy, euphoria, exaltation, bliss. Pleasure might just be stretched too thin, operating as a kind of catch-all for all the fine gradations of positive experience. (Plato thought so.) But, if asked  what it is that makes an experience positive, I would be hard pressed not to fall back and say, well, it\u2019s the experiences that give me pleasure.\n The pleasures of the mind are good; the pleasures of the body, not so much\n Nowadays, many philosophers enjoy delicate concept carving, in which definitions are given so precisely that no counterexamples could be found. Ideas are divided and subdivided, and  isms blossom and war with one another. But, traditionally, pleasure was rather bluntly cleaved into the two kinds of pleasures that I mentioned earlier: bodily pleasures and the pleasures of the mind. The division of pleasure mirrored the division of a person: the body was separate from the mind or the intellect or the soul, or whatever you would like to call that thing that makes you  you (but isn\u2019t your body). Bodily pleasures include easing into a warm bath, Arizona Iced Tea, and vigorous  masturbation; while among the pleasures of the mind are imagining retribution on your enemies (and maybe your friends), feeling at one with nature, contemplating the higher truths and, naturally for philosophers, philosophy \u2013 which has often been called the highest pleasure.\n Why is it that the bodily pleasures have accrued such a poor reputation? Plato, as usual, had the first, very loud, say on the matter. His views shift over the course of the dialogues, but some general themes stand out. Bodily pleasure, he says, is often connected to pain and, because pain is a bad thing, so too is bodily pleasure.\n The relationship between pleasure and pain is intimate and tempestuous indeed. Plato said that sometimes you feel pleasure precisely when you\u2019re relieved of a pain. Before Socrates was executed, he noticed that the bonds that he was kept in hurt him, but once released \u2018pleasure seem[ed] to be following\u2019. Bodily pleasures can also straightforwardly lead to pain, in the case of repetition or overindulgence. If I have one brownie, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about things, but if I have 50, I\u2019m in a dark place, re-examining my life decisions. Finally, pleasure also usually comes from fulfilling some desire. But Plato considered desires themselves painful, because they identify what in our lives is lacking. As Emily Fletcher put it in her excellent  analysis: \u2018[W]e always experience pleasure against a backdrop of pain.\u2019\n Bodily pleasures also receive the brunt of the blame for leading people astray, and this is Plato\u2019s other criticism (which would be taken up with gusto by later Christian moralists seeking to shape the actions of others). This is the idea that bodily pleasure, and the seeking of bodily pleasure, produces false beliefs because, through bodily pleasure, the body comes to seem more important than the soul (the false belief par excellence for Plato). In another foreshadowing of the Christian view, Plato wrote in the  Phaedo that your body is the \u2018prison\u2019 of your soul. There\u2019s a fast and essential distinction between the two, and a struggle between them as well. Whenever you indulge yourself in the pleasures of the flesh, you become \u2018an accomplice in [your] own imprisonment\u2019 because it gives you the misguided impression that this fleshy, soul-entombing jail is somehow a good thing. \u2018[E]very pleasure and pain provides,\u2019 Plato went on, \u2018another nail to rivet the soul to the body and to weld them together. It makes the soul corporeal, so that it necessarily believes the truth is what the body says it is.\u2019 The soul is the way to truth, and therefore the body and its pleasures are distractions leading to falsity and confusion.\n The pleasures of the mind, however, are free of most, if not all, of the blemishes that make bodily pleasures unworthy of philosophers. The pleasures of the mind are \u2018pure\u2019. They\u2019re usually unconnected in any intrinsic way to pain, and they have to do with the soul, which bears upon your inevitable journey into the afterlife. Plato thought that the greatest pleasure of the mind is the pleasure of learning \u2013 particularly of the virtues. By avoiding the pleasures of the flesh and instead learning of the virtue and wisdom, your soul will attain \u2018its own ornaments, namely, moderation, righteousness, courage, freedom and truth, and in that state [await your] journey to the underworld.\u2019\n But what exactly is  pleasurable about the pleasures of the mind? Thinkers have long made the connection between the pleasures of the mind and the great things unseen, usually God. More interesting, of course, is how they\u2019re described in a secular context. William James called intellectual pleasures \u2018the subtler emotions\u2019: \u2018Concords of sounds, of colours, of lines, logical consistencies, teleological fitnesses,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018affect us with a pleasure that seems ingrained in the very form of the representation itself.\u2019 These are \u2018cognitive acts\u2019, but ultimately not so different from the bodily pleasures, and he notes that when we\u2019re enthralled by a great pleasure of the mind, it tends to lead to pleasures of the body. We should be wary, as with most distinctions, of drawing the line too thick.\n  Next to the Christians, the Stoics were \u2013 and perhaps  are, given the recent  resurgence of interest \u2013 the great denigrators of bodily pleasure. Not all of them, but it\u2019s a suspicion that commonly invades their lofty view of the Universe. Virtue, for the Stoics, was all-important, the  summum bonum of life \u2013 at least if you\u2019re wise \u2013 and anything that got in the way of the pursuit of virtue was treated warily at best.  Path\u0113 (passions) were to be avoided, and pleasure was a significant contributor because it confuses clear thinking and creates untoward desires. The pleasures of the flesh were haughtily detested, a view that the Christians took up with verve.\n Their rivals in the ancient world were the Epicureans. Pleasure was the centre of Epicurus\u2019  thought. This wasn\u2019t pleasure in a positive sense, not a seasoning on the meat of life itself. It\u2019s pleasure as an  absence.\n  The pleasure that we pursue is not that kind alone which directly affects our being with delight and is perceived by the senses in an agreeable way. Rather we hold that the greatest pleasure is one that\u2019s experienced as a result of the complete removal of pain.\n Or, as Adam Smith later put it: \u2018What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear conscience?\u2019\n This view applies both to bodily pleasures and to pleasures of the mind. Epicurus thought that the pleasures of the flesh consisted, for instance, in  not being thirsty. What is the analogue to pleasures of the mind? He determined that the primary weight on our souls was the fear of death, which he sought to disabuse us of with an elegant little formula: when you are alive, death is nothing, and when you are dead, life is nothing. Once this is truly understood, then the weighty, wearying fear of death will be alleviated \u2013 and its  absence is a great pleasure.\n Though it is a moderate and negative view of bodily pleasure, it amounts to a fairly robust defence. It is an approach to life that tends to cultivate the materiality of our lives, to allow us to take joy in the physical humanness of being human. A line can be drawn from Epicurus to Valla to Erasmus to Montaigne to Voltaire to Hume to Mill to Russell: a life-affirming, world-accepting tradition that urges us not to fear the pleasures of the flesh (in moderation, of course). As Montaigne wrote: \u2018I, who operate only close to the ground, hate that inhuman wisdom that would make us disdainful enemies of the cultivation of the body.\u2019\n  On another April day, this one in 1336, Petrarch decided to go for a hike up Mont Ventoux, in Provence. It\u2019s not an easy task \u2013 an  18-hour round trip, more or less, up to a bald and very windy peak (hence the mountain\u2019s name). This ascent has since taken on the aspect of myth, a moment that seemed to herald the arrival of humanism, because it was supposedly the first time that someone had climbed a mountain simply for the pleasure of doing so. \u2018My only motive,\u2019 Petrarch wrote, \u2018was the wish to see what so great an elevation had to offer.\u2019\n His account is filled with allegory and heavy-handed allusions to  St Augustine\u2019s own conversion experience a millennium earlier. But it\u2019s still the moving testament of a man on a mountain,  taken in by the beauty of a singular landscape. He looks south towards Italy and is affected by memories of the ancient Romans. He looks west towards the Pyrenees and north towards Lyon and, even though he can\u2019t actually see these places, he knows that they are there and that he\u2019s standing tall above them, all of Europe at his feet. Naturally, he \u2018stood like one dazed\u2019.\n The pleasure Petrarch found in nature was in its immensity. He was lost in its vastness, overwhelmed by nature and his little place in it, hardly more than a speck of pollen in the wind. But he was also towering above the continent: \u2018I beheld the clouds under our feet,\u2019 he said. He is, at once, insignificant and all-powerful: an unsettling tension where you can sometimes find the subtle pleasures of the sublime. William Wordsworth was one of the first to illuminate this peculiar sensation, which he did most famously in his poem \u2018Tintern  Abbey\u2019 (1798):\n \u2013 And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man: A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things.\n But you can also find in nature a very different kind of pleasure, almost entirely at variance with the  sublime. That is the pleasures of isolation, of  solitude, of being freed, for a spell, from the drudgeries of \u2018society\u2019 and its countless goddamned \u2018people\u2019. Alone in nature, you can play as a hermit for a bit, which I think can allow you to recover a sense of your own uniqueness. As Byron wrote: \u2018There is a pleasure in the pathless  woods, / There is a rapture on the lonely shore.\u2019 Though he went on to acclaim his love of all nature, it is the  pathlessness of the woods that caught his interest: the pleasurable fact that, out here, no one\u2019s tread before. In that way, perhaps, nature can help remind you of the indelible pleasure of being yourself.\n  Schadenfreude is a bottomless reservoir, of course. Whether you drink from it with embarrassment or pride, it is still wonderfully pleasing to see your enemies fail \u2013 and most people have enough enemies, who do enough inexcusable stuff, that this particular spring of pleasure will never run dry. But what about its rather less provocative opposite: taking pleasure in the pleasure of others?\n It\u2019s been observed that when a child gives a gift to another kid, they themselves become happier. And the Buddhist idea of  mudit\u0101 captures the phenomenon: it is the joy we feel when others are well. We are an essentially social species, and many philosophers have  held that human nature cannot be fully realised without other people: being  with one another is an indispensable part of being a human in the first place. If that\u2019s the case, it makes a lot of sense that we would \u2018naturally\u2019 find the happiness of others pleasing to us. Of course \u2013  of course \u2013 a huge amount rides on whom we\u2019re talking about here. Yes, it\u2019s obviously pleasurable to gift a friend a top-notch loofah. But if you\u2019re genuinely pleased by, say, seeing Kim Jong-un\u2019s boyish excitement at attending a basketball game, then we need to have a serious talk about the world.\n Setting aside dictators and  jerks, why is it pleasing to make others pleased? Philosophers, particularly in the  18th century, had a winningly simple answer: because it is good. Or, more precisely, because  that is what goodness itself is \u2013 the increasing of pleasure in the world.\n Moral exhortations the world over have often boiled down to something like a common denominator: be not a nuisance to those you happen to be passing this life with, and, if you can, be a positive force for letting people get on with it. For instance, take these lines from a  4,000-year-old Babylonian advice book, amusing in their familiarity:\n Be pleasant to your enemy. Do not utter slander; speak well of people; Do not say nasty things; speak favourably.\n The question is  why people should act well. The answer has long been found in the divine and the otherworldly: because God\u2019s judging you and he\u2019s got a very sharp memory; because if you\u2019re a wretch there are some hellish surprises in store for you; because my interpretation of the Bible says so. What is radical about the philosophers who identified pleasure with goodness, then, is that they brought morality into the real world, there for it to be seen and tested, even quantified.\n Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third earl of Shaftesbury, was among the first to link the idea of the goodness of pleasure with the essentially social nature of humans. In  Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711), he made \u2018public good\u2019 in and of itself a virtue, necessary for all those who woul\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 11:30:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8003\u8651,pleasure,\u4e16\u754c", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u8003\u8651\u5feb\u4e50 ", "title_en": "How to Think about Pleasure", "transed": 1, "url": "https://psyche.co/guides/from-hedonism-to-humanism-philosophys-defence-of-pleasure", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8003\u8651", "pleasure", "\u4e16\u754c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067627, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u9605\u8bfb\u4e66\u7c4d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u53cb\u597d\u7248\u672c\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u5341\u51e0\u5bb6\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u91c7\u8bbf\u8fc7\u3002\u6211\u4e3a\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGoogle\uff0cNvidia\uff0cSnap\uff0cNetflix\uff0cPrimer AI\u548cSnorkel AI\u3002\u6211\u4e5f\u88ab\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u9762\u8bd5\u5b98\uff0c\u6211\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u5728Nvidia\u548cSnorkel Ai\u7684\u62db\u8058\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u51b7\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u90a3\u91cc\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u505a\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9762\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fa9\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u96c7\u7528\u5019\u9009\u4eba\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u8bf4\u670d\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u9009\u62e9\u6211\u4eec\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u4f18\u60e0\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u670b\u53cb\u548c\u8001\u5e08\uff0c\u6211\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbf\u8c08\u65b9\u9762\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u6211\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5632\u7b11\u9762\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u88ab\u95ee\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u6211\u8fd8\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u62db\u8058\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0a\u54a8\u8be2\u4e86\u51e0\u9879\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u96c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u60a8\u5c1a\u672a\u62e5\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u65b0\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u4ecd\u7136\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fdb\u5165\u65f6\u5f25\u8865\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u662f\u5750\u5728\u684c\u5b50\u4e24\u4fa7\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u6167\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8c01\u82b1\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u8003\u8651\u62db\u8058\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u7528\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u62db\u8058\u4e86\u90a3\u4e9b\u770b\u5230\u65e9\u671f\u8349\u6848\u7684\u7ecf\u7406\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u5982\u4f55\u62db\u8058\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7531\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u8be2\u95ee\u54ea\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u505a\u597d\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u4e5f\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u91c7\u8bbf\u8005\u7684\u5fc3\u6001\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bfb\u627e\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002 \n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u7531200\u591a\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4ee5\u5176\u96be\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73 -

You can find the source code on  GitHub.\n As a candidate, I\u2019ve interviewed at a dozen big companies and startups. I\u2019ve got offers for machine learning roles at companies including Google, NVIDIA, Snap, Netflix, Primer AI, and Snorkel AI. I\u2019ve also been rejected at many other companies.\n As an interviewer, I\u2019ve been involved in designing and executing the hiring process at NVIDIA and Snorkel AI, having taken steps from cold emailing candidates whose work I love, screening resumes, doing exploratory and technical interviews, debating whether or not to hire a candidate, to trying to convince candidates to choose us over competitive offers.\n As a friend and teacher, I\u2019ve helped many friends and students prepare for their machine learning interviews at big companies and startups. I give them mock interviews and take notes of the process they went through as well as the questions they were asked.\n I\u2019ve also consulted several startups on their machine learning hiring pipelines. Hiring for machine learning roles turned out to be pretty difficult when you don\u2019t already have a strong in-house machine learning team and process to help you evaluate candidates. As the use of machine learning in the industry is still pretty new, a lot of companies are still making it up as they go along, which doesn\u2019t make it easier for candidates.\n This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process.\n The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers\u2019 mindset and what kind of signals they look for.\n The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty -- interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions -- that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.\n After you&#39;ve finished this book, you might want to checkout  the 30 open-ended questions to test your ability to put together what you know to solve practical challenges. These questions test your problem-solving skills as well as the extent of your experiences in implementing and deploying machine learning models. Some companies call them  machine learning systems design questions. Almost all companies I\u2019ve talked to ask at least a question of this type in their interview process, and they are the questions that candidates often find to be the hardest.\n \u201cMachine learning systems design\u201d is an intricate topic that merits its own book. To learn more about it, check out my course   CS 329S: Machine learning systems design at Stanford.\n This book is not a replacement to machine learning textbooks nor a shortcut to game the interviews. It\u2019s a tool to consolidate your existing theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning. The questions in this book can also help identify your blind/weak spots.

\u6210\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5458 ", "note_en": "TechSee, which describes itself as an \u201c intelligent visual assistance\u201d company, today announced the launch of Eve Cortex, a platform that teaches itself to recognize thousands of products, models, parts, and components by ingesting only a handful of data points. TechSee claims that by leveraging a combination of  AI and synthetic data, Cortex can train itself in a matter of hours, providing end users with step-by-step visual guidance via an  augmented reality (AR) overlay.\n The\u00a0AR market is estimated to grow from $10.7 billion in 2019 to $72.7 billion by 2024, according to a recent Markets and Markets\u00a0 report. At least a portion of that growth has been driven by field service applications; technicians are faced with the challenging task of working on equipment with varying technical specifications, often in confined or hard-to-reach spaces. With AR apps, they could have all of the information they need displayed in front of them while keeping their hands free to work.\n  TechSee was founded in 2014 by Eitan Cohen, Amir Yoffe, and Gabby Sarusi. Cohen conceptualized the idea after struggling to walk his parents through an issue they were having with their cable service. The company\u2019s cross-platform apps employ computer vision to recognize products and issues and streamline warranty registration. Customer agents can see what customers see through their smartphone cameras and visually guide them to resolutions, using either live video or photos.\n Cortex builds on TechSee\u2019s existing technologies to enable enterprises to custom-build their own visual self-service flows, without coding. With Cortex, companies can design journeys for product unboxing, billing, contracting, troubleshooting, warranty claims, product registration, technical repair, and more.\n \u201cThe future is here, and it\u2019s time to say goodbye to user manuals and embrace AR assistants,\u201d Cohen said in a press release. \u201cVirtual assistants that can see, hear, read, and interact are what\u2019s going to transform the way that consumers and employees receive assistance, while saving brands millions and generating new revenue.\u201d\n  Cortex can walk users through the unboxing of various consumer electronics, from security cameras to thermostats, and capture information for upselling while explaining invoices by reading water, gas, and electrical meters. Insurance policyholders can use Cortex to document damage to insured property or identify items they want to insure for virtual underwriting. Moreover, Cortex can certify that an on-site field technician has made a successful repair by examining work through the technician\u2019s smartphone or tablet camera or AR glasses.\n Behind the scenes, TechSee employs a combination of few-shot learning, transfer learning, and fine tuning for image segmentation and classification.  Few-shot learning refers to the practice of feeding an AI model with a very small amount of training data, while  transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is repurposed on a second task.\n One of the ways that Cortex learns to recognize products is by ingesting a company\u2019s existing contact center knowledge base. For every device, each article describing visual symptoms and issues, both from customers and field technicians, is extracted and normalized. Then, a computer vision model is trained on synthetic visual data gathered in the lab as well as other visual resources and images supplied by customers, enabling Cortex to analyze, time, and measure the success of each step of every resolution, shortening and optimizing them over time.\n To use Cortex, a user taps on a link sent in a text message from a self-service channel and connects via a web browser. They\u2019re guided visually and with voice instructions on how to capture images. After they receive a confirmation message with a reference code, a customer service agent joins, views the images during a live video session, and provides step-by-step on-screen AR guidance.\n According to Cohen, companies including Vodafone, Telus, Orange, and Hippo have already tapped Cortex to create new customer experiences. Moreover, tens of thousands of field service technicians in the U.S. are using the platform to install fiber optic boxes.\n \u201cOne of the very few silver linings to come out of this pandemic is that it\u2019s accelerated adoption for our technology \u2014 in the field, at support centers, and for individual consumers,\u201d Cohen told VentureBeat in a previous interview. \u201cEverything is now contactless. When technicians simply aren\u2019t allowed to enter a customer\u2019s home to repair, say, a wireless router, or when a field technician cannot be dispatched to repair an HVAC system, both businesses and customers have to adapt.\u201d\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.
