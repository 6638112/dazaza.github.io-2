So they just stay in business. It&#39;s really getting old.\n      level 1  I got this too. Last post removed was posting that I donated blood in a friend&#39;s name because he is in the hospital with Leukemia and the hospital credits his account with blood donations.\n Facebook removed that post about two months ago for spam, but there was no way to appeal it.\n level 2  Im on a 30 day ban right now. The question: should we kill one child to cure every single disease? My answer: we should just kill all the humans in a real life Battle Royale setting.\n level 1  Literally the same thing happened to me. Posted 1 photo to a group I am a very regular contributor of and banned with no message in my support inbox and no reason.\n   level 2  I have the same issue! When I posted it said &#34;restricted from posting...bla bla till december 4&#34; but when I check in my support inbox there I have no ban notification, it says &#34;no infractions&#34;. So wtf?\n  level 2  Yes! I made a comment about a splash pad in my community mom group and then got this message. Wtf facebook?\n level 2  Me too, I posted something completely benign about a new house being built in the area and next thing I know I have a six month restriction in groups. Is this a glitch?\n level 2  You can report it if you go into your support inbox if you took a SS report it... I just reported mine and I am waiting on response...

In this paper we analyze the swing ratio (beat-upbeat ratio) implied by the drummer on the ride cymbal. Extending previous work, we propose a new method for semi-automatic swing ratio estimation based on pattern recognition in onset sequences. As a main contribution, we introduce a novel time-swing ratio representation called swingogram, which locally captures information related to the swing ratio over time. Based on this representation, we propose to track the most plausible trajectory of the swing ratio of the ride cymbal pattern over time via dynamic programming. We show how this kind of visualization leads to interesting insights into the peculiarities of jazz musicians improvising together.\n To cite this article:  Christian Dittmar, Martin Pfleiderer, Stefan Balke &amp; Meinard M\u00fcller (2018) A\n      A typical micro-rhythmic trait of jazz performances is their \u2018swing feel.\u2019 According to several studies,\n uneven eighth notes contribute decisively to this perceived quality.

It don\u2019t mean a thing if it\n ... Dittmar et al. address microtiming deviations in jazz [45, 44], and Marchand et al. [107] determine the &#34;level of swing&#34; of diverse genres. These works are concerned with simpler rhythmic patterns-consisting of two eight-notes-and the authors use the autocorrelation computed from an ODF as feature. ...\n ... By looking at the autocorrelation one can obtain information about the relative position of events in a straightforward manner, similarly as it is done by clustering different pattern occurrences as in 3.2.1. The authors of these works propose interesting representations of microtiming deviations such as the swing-ratio [107] or the swingogram  [44], which intend to bring information about the performance other than meter and tempo. This kind of effort in the literature helps closing the gap between what characterizes a musical performance and what automatic-analysis tools can retrieve. ...\n ... 1 Figure 9.1 illustrates an example of microtiming at the sixteenth note level. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39;  [44,107,37]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n Computational rhythm analysis deals with extracting and processing meaningful rhythmical information from musical audio. It proves to be a highly complex task, since dealing with real audio recordings requires the ability to handle its acoustic and semantic complexity at multiple levels of representation. Existing methods for rhythmic analysis typically focus on one of those levels, failing to exploit music\u2019s rich structure and compromising the musical consistency of automatic estimations. In this work, we propose novel approaches for leveraging multi-scale information for computational rhythm analysis. Our models account for interrelated dependencies that musical audio naturally conveys, allowing the interplay between different time scales and accounting for music coherence across them. In particular, we conduct a systematic analysis of downbeat tracking systems, leading to convolutional-recurrent architectures that exploit short and long term acoustic modeling; we introduce a skip-chain conditional random field model for downbeat tracking designed to take advantage of music structure information (i.e. music sections repetitions) in a unified framework; and we propose a language model for joint tracking of beats and micro-timing in Afro-Latin American music. Our methods are systematically evaluated on a diverse group of datasets, ranging from Western music to more culturally specific genres, and compared to state-of-the-art systems and simpler variations. The overall results show that our models for downbeat tracking perform on par with the state of the art, while being more musically consistent. Moreover, our model for the joint estimation of beats and microtiming takes further steps towards more interpretable systems. The methods presented here offer novel and more holistic alternatives for computational rhythm analysis, towards a more comprehensive automatic analysis of music.\n ... In some cases, the events in music present small-scale temporal deviations with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid, a phenomenon here referred to as microtiming. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39; [8, 9,30]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n ... The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. This is the case of jazz  [9,10,20,38], Cuban rumba [2], Brazilian samba [32,39] and Uruguayan candombe [22], among others. Consequently, the analysis of these music genres without considering microtiming leads to a limited understanding of their rhythm. ...\n ... The proposal exploits some simplifications: assuming constant tempo and swing ratio, and propagating beat positions based on the most likely position of the first beat. More recent works perform semi-automatic analysis still relying on informed tempo  [9,10], or using an external algorithm for its estimation [30]. Within the context of candombe and samba, microtiming characterization has also been addressed using either semi-automatic or heuristic methods [17,22,32]. ...\n Events in music frequently exhibit small-scale temporal deviations (microtiming), with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid. In some cases, as in music from the Afro-Latin American tradition, such deviations appear systematically , disclosing their structural importance in rhythmic and stylistic configuration. In this work we explore the idea of automatically and jointly tracking beats and microtiming in timekeeper instruments of Afro-Latin American music, in particular Brazilian samba and Uruguayan candombe. To that end, we propose a language model based on conditional random fields that integrates beat and onset likelihoods as observations. We derive those activations using deep neural networks and evaluate its performance on manually annotated data using a scheme adapted to this task. We assess our approach in controlled conditions suitable for these timekeeper instruments, and study the microtiming profiles&#39; dependency on genre and performer, illustrating promising aspects of this technique towards a more comprehensive understanding of these music traditions.\n ... As one central benefit, computational methods enable corpus-based studies on a large scale. Several studies have been conducted recently for different music genres including pop music [13], jazz [1, 6,9], and Western classical music [2,17,21,24], and also in the field of ethnomusicology [14,16,19]. For conducting such corpus studies, a number of different aspects are important. ...\n ... Beyond its size and composition, the representation of the music data constitutes an important aspect. For example, the data can be given as a symbolic transcription [9,16], as a graphical score [17], or as an audio recording  [6,13,18]. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the music representation type on the corpus analysis results. ...\n ... A major benefit of the WJD lies in its clean annotations of the solo melody (fundamental frequency, F0), which create a controlled environment for systematic experiments. The data served as basis for a number of musicological studies, which mainly focus on performance analysis [1, 6,9]. ...\n For musicological studies on large corpora, the compilation of suitable data constitutes a time-consuming step. In particular, this is true for high-quality symbolic representations that are generated manually in a tedious process. A recent study on Western classical music has shown that musical phenomena such as the evolution of tonal complexity over history can also be analyzed on the basis of audio recordings. As our first contribution, we transfer this corpus analysis method to jazz music using the Weimar Jazz Database, which contains high-level symbolic transcriptions of jazz solos along with the audio recordings. Second, we investigate the influence of the input representation type on the corpus-level observations. In our experiments , all representation types led to qualitatively similar results. We conclude that audio recordings can build a reasonable basis for conducting such type of corpus analysis.\n ... Moreover, music recommender systems could use the data to better rate the danceability and rhythmic similarity between different songs. Going more into musicological research, there is a high interest in determining microrhythmic properties such as swing, shuffle and groove [16]-  [18] inherent in music recordings. Robust ADT in conjunction with precise estimation of onset times (see discussion in Sect. ...\n ... For example, if the desired output is a musical score or tabulature, the time resolution for the detected onsets can be relatively coarse as onset times are quantized based on the smallest increment within a metrical grid (i.e., 16th or 32nd notes), for these kind of representations. For other applications, like analysis of (un-)intentional variation of onset timings by human performers (e.g.,for humanization), musicological studies of micro-timing [16]-  [18], or extraction of a precise symbolic representation (e.g.,MIDI files), a greater precision is required. Perceptionally, the lower bound of the time-gap which allows humans to identify two click sounds as separate is somewhere in the range of 8 -10 ms [90]. ...\n In Western popular music, drums and percussion are an important means to emphasize and shape the rhythm, often defining the musical style. If computers were able to analyze the drum part in recorded music, it would enable a variety of rhythm-related music processing tasks. Especially the detection and classification of drum sound events by computational methods is considered to be an important and challenging research problem in the broader field of Music Information Retrieval. Over the last two decades, several authors have attempted to tackle this problem under the umbrella term Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT). This paper presents a comprehensive review of ADT research, including a thorough discussion of the task-specific challenges, categorization of existing techniques, and evaluation of several state-of-the-art systems. To provide more insights on the practice of ADT systems, we focus on two families of ADT techniques, namely methods based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Recurrent Neural Networks. We explain the methods&#39; technical details and drum-specific variations and evaluate these approaches on publicly available datasets with a consistent experimental setup. Finally, the open issues and under-explored areas in ADT research are identified and discussed, providing future directions in this field.\n ... Dynagrams and tempograms, for example, are used to visualize various temporal levels of loudness and tempo variations, respectively.  Dittmar et al. (2018) devised swingogram representations by analyzing and tracking the swing ratio implied by the ride cymbal in jazz swing performance. This visualization enables insights into jazz improvisation such as the interaction between a soloist and the drummer. ...\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition. Different performances of the same composition may vary in terms of performance parameters such as timing or dynamics, and these variations may have a major impact on how a listener perceives the music. The analysis of music performance has traditionally been a peripheral topic for the MIR research community, where often a single audio recording is used as representative of a musical work. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from several perspectives including the measurement of performance parameters, the relation of those parameters to the actions and intentions of a performer or perceptual effects on a listener, and finally the assessment of musical performance. This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n ... Microtiming deviations and their variation across time have been studied in the context of time-keeper instruments (e.g., in Brazilian samba [12], Uruguayan candombe [18], and jazz  [21]). While previous approaches focus on within-instrument rhythmic patterns, we also explore the microtiming generated between time-keepers and nontime-keeper instruments. ...\n Maracatu de baque solto&#34; is a Carnival performance combining music, poetry, and dance, occurring in the Zona da Mata Norte region of Pernambuco (Northeast Brazil). Maracatu percussive music is strongly repetitive, and is played as loud and as fast as possible. Both from an MIR and ethnomusicological perspective this makes a complex musical scene to analyse and interpret. In this paper we focus on the extraction of microtiming profiles towards the longer term goal of understanding how rhythmic performance in Maracatu is used to promote health and well-being. To conduct this analysis we use a set of recordings acquired with contact microphones which minimise the interference between performers. Our analysis reveals that the microtiming profiles differ substantially from those observed in more widely studied South American music. In particular, we highlight the presence of dynamic microtim-ing profiles as well as the importance of the choice of timekeeper instrument, which dictates how the performances can be understood. Throughout this work, we emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in which MIR, audio engineering, and ethnomusicology must interact to provide meaningful insight about this music.\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition.

This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n The advent of affordable digital sampling technology brought about great changes in music production. Experienced producers of sample-based electronic music (SBEM) are capable of understanding the intricate relationship between a sampled source and its use in a new track, harnessing its properties to shape the structure, timbre, and rhythm of their compositions. However, automated analysis of the phenomena surrounding both SBEM and the sources it uses for its samples is a challenge which involves many tasks from music information retrieval (MIR) and audio processing. In this thesis we develop models and techniques to better understand SBEM at different levels. In particular, we offer four main technical contributions to retrieval and analysis tasks. First, we explore how timbral changes affect the spectral peak maps used in audio fingerprinting as a means to identify overlapping samples. Second, we analyze the structure of typical SBEM tracks using audio decomposition based on non-negative matrix factor deconvolution (NMFD). Third, we investigate the interaction of timbre and structure by designing a mid-level audio feature based on cascaded harmonic-residual-percussive source separation (CHRP). Fourth, we apply random forests to identify the quintessential sampling source: drum breaks. Given their prominent role in SBEM, we devote considerable attention to drum breaks. As an application to computational musicology, we formalize an algorithm for calculating local swing ratio in drum breaks and adapt an autocorrelation-based method to analyze their microrhythmic properties. Finally, we present a creative application to music production which allows combining the temporal and timbral properties of two separate drum breaks (redrumming). Despite the massive commercial success of SBEM and the practice of sampling, they mostly remain outside the attention of formal academic studies and MIR research. In this thesis our overarching goal is to identify and formalize some of the fundamental audio processing tasks related to SBEM, proposing methods that can seed further research.\n Music constitutes a challenging multimedia scenario. Besides music recordings, there exist a number of other media objects including symbolic music representations, video recordings, scanned sheet music, or textual metadata.

", "note_en": "On May 17, the City Council of Mesa, Arizona, approved the  $800 million development of an enormous data center -- a warehouse filled with computers storing all of the photos, documents and other information we store \u201cin the cloud\u201d -- on an arid plot of land in the eastern part of the city.\n But keeping the rows of powerful computers inside the data center from overheating will require up to 1.25 million gallons of water each day, a price that Vice Mayor Jenn Duff believes is too high.\u201cThis has been the driest 12 months in 126 years,\u201d she said, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWe are on red alert, and I think data centers are an irresponsible use of our water.\u201d\n   Duff was the only Mesa City Council member to vote against  the development. But she\u2019s one of a growing number of people nationwide raising concerns about the proliferation of data centers,  which guzzle electricity and water while creating relatively few jobs, particularly in drought-stricken parts of the United States.\n  The spike in use of data-intensive cloud services such as video conferencing tools, video streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube and online gaming, particularly as people quarantined during the pandemic, has increased demand for the computing power offered by data centers globally. And this means more data centers are being built every day by some of America\u2019s largest technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google and used by millions of customers.  According to the Synergy Research Group, there were about 600 \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers, massive operations designed and operated by a single company that then rents access to cloud services, globally by the end of 2020. That\u2019s double the number there were in 2015. Almost 40 percent of them are in the United States, and  Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of the total.\n The U.S. also has at least 1,800 \u201ccolocation\u201d data centers, warehouses filled with a variety of smaller companies\u2019 server hardware that share the same cooling system, electricity and security, according to  Data Center Map. They are typically smaller than hyperscale data centers but,  research has shown, more resource intensive as they maintain a variety of computer systems operating at different levels of efficiency.\n Many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. Researchers at Virginia Tech estimate that one-fifth of data centers draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds, mostly in the Western United States, according to a  paper published in April.\n  Typically, where data centers are located is based on proximity to customers and infrastructure, the cost of land, the tax incentives offered by local governments and access to low-cost electricity, the researchers said.\n \u201cI am not sure the degree to which environmental considerations are in the decision-making process,\u201d said Landon Marston, lead author of the paper.\n All centers need some form of cooling technology, typically either computer room air-conditioning systems -- essentially large units that cool air with water or refrigerant -- or evaporative cooling, which evaporates water to cool the air. Evaporative cooling uses a lot less electricity, but more water. Since water is cheaper than electricity, data centers tend to opt for the more water-intensive approach.\n The growth in the industry shows no signs of slowing. The research company Gartner predicts that spending on global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion this year, an increase of 6 percent from 2020, followed by 3-4 percent annually over the next three years. This growth comes at a time of record temperatures and drought in the United States,  particularly in the West.\n  \u201cThe typical data center uses about 3-5 million gallons of water per day -- the same amount of water as a city of 30,000-50,000 people,\u201d said Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University.\n  Although these data centers have become  much more energy and water efficient over the last decade, and don\u2019t use as much water as other industries such as agriculture, this level of water use can still create potential competition with local communities over the water supply in areas where water is scarce, he added.\n But some tech companies like Google say they are trying to address their water use.\n \u201cAs part of our water stewardship efforts, we\u2019re working to utilize water more efficiently and exploring ways to incorporate circularity,\u201d said Gary Demasi, senior director of energy and location operations at Google. \u201cWe have a site-specific approach where we work within the constraints of the local hydrological environment to find the best solutions.\u201d\n He added that \u201cmany arid environments provide an abundant supply of carbon-free solar and wind energy,\u201d which explains why data centers are drawn to those areas.\n  Sergio Loureiro, vice president of core operations for Microsoft, said that the company  has pledged to be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030, which means it plans to replenish more water than it consumes globally. This includes reducing the company\u2019s water use and investing in community replenishment and conservation projects near where it builds facilities.\n    In recent years,  tensions over water use by data centers have flared in communities across the United States. In 2017, conservation groups in South Carolina  criticized Google over its request for a permit to draw 1.5 millions of gallons of water per day from a depleted aquifer to cool its expanding data center in Goose Creek. The facility already required 4 million gallons of tap water each day, and residents and conservation groups were concerned about the company\u2019s  impact on the dwindling groundwater supply. After a two-year battle with the South Carolina Coastal Conservation league over the plans, Google reached an agreement to use only groundwater under limited conditions, for example, during maintenance work or as a backup during drier months, and instead pay for an alternative source of surface water from the Charleston Water System.\n  Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said that the company partnered with local community stakeholders and water conservation experts to assess the data center\u2019s impact and conducted studies that showed that even in an \u201cextreme worst-case scenario\u201d the data center\u2019s water use in the area would be sustainable.\n Both companies and consumers need to start treating water conservation as seriously as reducing carbon emissions, experts say.\n   \u201cWe are going to experience a drier and more water-scare future, and every drop of water counts,\u201d said Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Amazon, Microsoft and Google causing these water footprints. But it\u2019s you and me, searching and needing data that ends up in these data centers.\u201d\n Ajami said that water has been historically undervalued as a resource in part because it has been cheap for companies to purchase. While many industries have taken great leaps in reducing their electricity use and carbon footprints, they lag behind in water efficiency throughout their supply chains, she said.\n  \u201cWe often overlook the communities impacted, who are often disadvantaged,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was a wealthy community, maybe they wouldn\u2019t allow the data centers to be built in their backyard.\u201d\n   Water conservation experts say that a key challenge has been the lack of alignment between cities\u2019 economic development plans and their resource conservation efforts. Often the promise of attracting a household-name technology company to build a billion-dollar data center that will bring jobs and investment to the region will override concerns over the water supply.\n  \u201cCities don\u2019t want to tell tech companies that they can\u2019t come to their city because of lack of water,\u201d said Cora Kammeyer, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on water conservation.\n   \u201cWhen it comes to economic development, I don\u2019t think we are fully transparent about the water concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep the image that we are a great place to invest and start a business. But we don\u2019t like to talk about the water.\u201d The Mesa project approved on May 17, which was submitted under the name of a developer called Redale LLC, has been shrouded in secrecy. The name of the company that will run the data center has only been supplied to the city under a nondisclosure agreement, although one Mesa city source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was Facebook. The specialist news site  Data Center Dynamics also reported that it was likely to be Facebook based on similarities in the planning specifications to its other data centers. Facebook declined to comment, and Redale did not respond to a request for comment. The proposed data center will employ an estimated 150 people across three buildings and pay the city millions of dollars in sales tax on the construction and utilities.\n Duff added that even though data centers don\u2019t use as much water as other industries, they are \u201cstill depleting water in the desert, and that is a concern.\u201d\n She noted that this is the \u201ceighth or ninth\u201d data center project in Mesa. The city previously approved a Google facility, currently under construction, that will consume up to 4 million gallons of water per day,  as reported by Bloomberg. The Redale project represents a significant milestone to Mesa\u2019s water supply as it\u2019s the first where the city required the developer to obtain water credits from the Salt River Project to use groundwater in the event that the city can\u2019t meet the data center\u2019s demand for water.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could say we had enough water for the business,\u201d Duff said.\n  Surface water supplies that Arizona uses from Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, and the Colorado River that feeds it, have already  dwindled to their lowest levels ever, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal water management agency. The water level is so low that federal restrictions are likely to be triggered on Arizona\u2019s water allocation from the reservoir, which could happen at the start of 2022. S ix other states in the West could also face such restrictions.\n As that happens, Duff said, more companies will start to draw on their \u201cwater credits\u201d to use groundwater supplies. However,  according to research by Arizona State University, these water credits are over allocated, meaning that if everybody started using them at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough water to go around.\n \u201cWe are very resourceful, but I think we need to wake up,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe analysis shows our safeguards aren\u2019t there and we need to come up with a concrete plan instead of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n   To the south of Mesa, the city of Chandler, Arizona, has taken a different approach. In 2015 the city passed an ordinance that restricted new water-intensive businesses from developing unless they aligned with the city\u2019s plan for economic development. It effectively deters businesses that use a lot of water but don\u2019t create many jobs, including data centers, in favor of those that create thousands of jobs,  such as semiconductor plants.\n  The city\u2019s water resource manager, Gregg Capps, said the ordinance, the first of its kind in the U.S., was introduced as a direct result of discovering in 2013 how much water one of the data centers in the city was using after the company started requesting additional water connections. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them back then, but that brought our attention to their water use,\u201d he said.\n His team took their concerns to the City Council, which spent months developing the ordinance. Since it was adopted in 2015, there have been no new data center developments in Chandler.\n \u201cWater is a strategic resource. It\u2019s important to us,\u201d Capps said.\n   The Silicon Valley technology companies that dominate the hyperscale data center market -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- are conscious of the business and reputational risk associated with data centers\u2019 thirst. All of them have made some progress in reducing their data centers\u2019 water footprint through innovative cooling strategies. These include free-air cooling, which uses fresh outdoor air to cool a space, and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in a liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, taking the heat with it. However, free-air cooling only really works in cooler climates, and immersion was just used  for the first time in a commercial setting by Microsoft in April.\n  Some companies,  including Microsoft have developed underwater or partially submerged data centers that rely on large bodies of already cool water to disperse heat.\n Google\u2019s Demasi said that the company cooled its data centers using seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium and recycled wastewater in the United States, at its site in Douglas County, Georgia.\n  Switching over to new technologies can be extremely costly, and data center operators are more likely to wait until the end of the lifecycle of the existing equipment than retrofit cooling systems, said Todd Boucher, founder of the data center design firm Leading Edge Design Group.\n   In Mesa, Duff is thinking about the legacy of the decisions her city, and others, are making about water now. \u201cI am 61 years old, and I know that in whatever lifetime I have left I will not see the total impact of what we are doing today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our children and their children will, and we have to take responsibility for that.\u201d\u201cI hope the next generation does not look back at ours and say, \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we saw the warnings and started taking aggressive measures in order to preserve our planet and our lives.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:59:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}]
