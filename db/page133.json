you&#39;re wondering, you&#39;d need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.\n Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.\n   This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up.  \u00a0 Too bad they&#39;re all too small to appear on this map.\n  If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.\n All these distances are just averages, mind you.  \u00a0 The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun. \u00a0 So if you&#39;re planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.\n If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets. \u00a0 The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter. \u00a0 Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll take a lot less than 13 months to scroll there.\n     I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren&#39;t drawn to scale. \u00a0  It&#39;s not hard to draw the planets.  \u00a0 It&#39;s the empty space that&#39;s a problem.\n   When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt... \u00a0 Those things are too much for our brains to handle.\n We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.\n We&#39;re always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.\n  You would need    of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.\n If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet. \u00a0 475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.\n Even though we don\u2019t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space. \u00a0  A drop of water can carve out a canyon. \u00a0 An amoeba can become a dolphin. \u00a0 A star can collapse on itself.\n It\u2019s easy to disregard nothingness because there\u2019s no thought available to encapsulate it. There\u2019s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.\n It\u2019s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we\u2019d have no point of reference at all. \u00a0 We\u2019d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren\u2019t built to understand.\n All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you\u2019re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren\u2019t there.\n  &#34;Sorry, Humanity,&#34; says Evolution. &#34;What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn\u2019t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness.&#34;\n Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.\n The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still... \u00a0 Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.\n When you hear people talk about how, &#34;there\u2019s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of&#34; it&#39;s usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you&#39;re watching late at night when you can\u2019t get to sleep.\n Even when Shakespeare wrote: &#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d \u2013 he&#39;s basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.\n But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.\n You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.\n   If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.\n Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty... \u00a0 but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.\n  If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?\n  With so much emptiness, aren&#39;t stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?\n But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.\n You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds, they  aren&#39;t empty. \u00a0 If you&#39;re drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.\n What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn&#39;t be special at all.\n It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.\n Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment.  We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.\n It&#39;s reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.\n The fact that you&#39;re here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.\n  Might as well stop now. We&#39;ll need to scroll through 6,771 more maps like this before we see anything else.

The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people. Those with higher incomes often offset price increases (goods, services) with increased income. Furthermore, prices often increase more for basic needs than for luxury items, a phenomenon economists call \u201cinflation inequality.\u201d Simply put, low-income families\u2019 budgets will stress and strain as they confront the coming rising costs of the essentials they need (food, energy, transport, child care).\n  The economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable Americans too often tends to be discussed as a matter of the latest Washington program or policy. Those acting in the name of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators such as employment rates by demographic group, incomes and, yes, inflation, if we want to truly understand what\u2019s happening not just to the economy in a general sense but specifically to the most vulnerable within it.\n  As coming waves of inflation will demonstrate, the fundamentals\u2014and not the latest federal government initiative\u2014will most directly characterize and affect the economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable in our country.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

But a growing contingent of medical experts is now questioning whether that conventional wisdom ought to apply to children.\n Their doubts are not borne of conspiracy beliefs, but couched in the carefully calibrated language of risk and benefit. And they&#39;re expected to  get a public airing next week as advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ponder a spate of post-vaccine heart problems in adolescents and young adults.\n No one is arguing that COVID-19 immunizations for kids should stop altogether. Rather, a debate has erupted over the need to inoculate healthy children as soon as possible and according to the two-dose regimen authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have been administered safely to millions of adults and been vetted in several thousand adolescents. But neither has been subjected to exhaustive testing in diverse pediatric populations, as is typically required for a vaccine intended for universal use in kids.\n The FDA authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use in adolescents as young as 12 on May 10. In the weeks that have followed, the safety monitoring systems managed by the FDA and CDC detected dozens of cases of a possible side effect in newly vaccinated teens: an inflammation of the heart muscle known as  myocarditis.\n The cases typically developed in older adolescents, most of them boys, three to four days after they got a second dose. Virtually all were considered mild, presenting as chest pain and tightness that resolved after treatment with over-the-counter medications. None of the patients appear to have died or suffered serious cardiac malfunction, though it&#39;s too early to know whether they will suffer long-term effects.\n As of June 10, the government&#39;s vaccine monitoring systems detected 226 cases of myocarditis or a related condition called  pericarditis after vaccination in people younger than 30. Normally, fewer than 100 cases would be expected for this age group, said  Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC&#39;s Immunization Safety Office.\n  More investigation is needed to determine whether the vaccine caused these heart problems or if the timing was merely a coincidence, he said.\n Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the reports will give the CDC\u2019s  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices an opportunity to \u201cgive people a clinic on relative risk\u201d \u2014 as it did after the COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp; Johnson was  linked to a rare blood-clotting disorder in younger women but still  deemed safe for use.\n Offit said he doubts the myocarditis cases will upend the long-standing certainty that kids should be vaccinated quickly.\n  Others aren\u2019t so sure. The possibility that children getting the vaccine \u2014 especially a second dose \u2014 could put their hearts at risk has amplified calls for more debate before parents, schools and others embrace the conviction that all healthy children need to get vaccinated.\n  It\u2019s not just the prospect of a surprise side effect that has prompted the sudden surge in vaccine caution.\n As the pandemic appears to be winding down across the United States and its limited toll on children has been tallied, it\u2019s no longer clear that immunizing children will bring the outbreak to a faster close, said  Dr. Martin Makary, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n Makary is urging his colleagues to \u201cthink twice\u201d before recommending universal COVID-19 vaccination of healthy kids. Given the data in hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no compelling case for it right now,\u201d he  wrote this month in MedPage, a website widely read by physicians.\n In an interview, Makary said his concerns might be allayed with a more thorough examination of the safety data.\n \u201cBut no one is thinking like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve converted now from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism.\u201d\n Given the general decline in new infections and hospitalizations, there\u2019s time for a thorough FDA vetting of the vaccines for children and adolescents, Makary said. Even if it takes months, it could wind up protecting more children from harm.\n The emerging debate threatens to divide a community that\u2019s largely been united by the pandemic.\n From the moment that the first COVID-19 vaccine started  going into Americans&#39; arms, one certainty has seemed almost beyond questioning: As soon as enough doses were available, the nation\u2019s children would roll up their sleeves.\n  Although it\u2019s clear COVID-19 has largely spared children from severe illness, the CDC says  456 American kids have died of the disease, though that is considered a conservative estimate.\n At least 20,000 \u2014 and as many as 100,000 \u2014 kids have been hospitalized with COVID-19. Indeed, the CDC reports that even as adult hospitalizations declined in March and April, the rate at which adolescents were admitted ticked upward. Nearly one-third were treated in intensive care units, undercutting the argument that severe illness rarely happens in this age group.\n COVID-19\u2019s toll on some children also lingers well beyond a bout of infection. As of mid-May, at least 4,018 in the U.S. have developed a condition called  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MISC, that frequently appears four to six weeks after a child has cleared his or her infection and typically requires hospitalization.\n  If COVID-19 were a disease seen only in children, statistics such as these would galvanize medical professionals and public health officials to find a way to protect them, New York pediatrician  Dr. Risa Hoshino wrote in a  MedPage commentary sparked in part by Makary\u2019s views.\n By any definition, COVID-19 has been an emergency for the nation\u2019s children and the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization is an \u201cappropriate pathway\u201d for getting vaccines to young Americans, she added.\n At Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, pediatric cardiologist  Dr. Jodie Votava-Smith has seen the wreckage of COVID-19 firsthand, and she has no doubts about the value of vaccinating kids.\n In the last month, she has helped treat a patient who developed myocarditis after a dose of vaccine, she said. The child\u2019s symptoms were mild and readily treated with ibuprofen.\n Votava-Smith said her assessment of vaccines\u2019 value has been more profoundly shaped by the dozens of children treated at CHLA for serious heart muscle inflammation as a result of having COVID-19. These children were severely ill and now face potentially enduring health effects. The disease was the cause of their misery, she said, not the vaccine.\n The mother of two children who are 5 and 7, Votava-Smith said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait\u201d to get them vaccinated. \u201cThey know they\u2019ll be getting their shot when it\u2019s their turn,\u201d she said.\n Dr. H. Cody Meissner, a Tufts University pediatrician who advises the FDA on vaccines, said it&#39;s a mistake to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines for children in the same way as it was cleared for emergency use in adults.\n \u201cThe risk calculation for vaccinating an adult is pretty easy,\u201d he said. When as many as 4,000 adults a day were dying of COVID-19, \u201ceven if there was a little risk of vaccine, most people would accept that.\u201d\n But for children, he said, \u201cthe calculus is a bit different.\u201d Although they seem to contract the coronavirus pretty readily, they\u2019re far less likely than adults to get sick or die. So even if instances of post-vaccination myocarditis are rare, they still change the risk-benefit analysis.\n \u201cThe data are not sufficient to say that the benefit of these COVID-19 vaccines outweighs the risk in children and adolescents,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cWe may get there. But we\u2019re not there now.\u201d\n  Updates:  8:08 AM, Jun. 18, 2021:  This story originally said the CDC vaccine advisory committee would discuss COVID-19 vaccines for children at a meeting on Friday, June 18.
