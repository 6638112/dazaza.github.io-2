Multiple  recent  surveys show that many workers rank flexibility among their top priorities, topping even pay. But University of Kent sociologist Heejung Chung says those who chase flexibility—defined as some control over one’s time and place of work—might be setting themselves up for trouble.</p><p>在过去的几年里，工人们已经尝到了灵活工作的滋味，他们渴望得到更多。最近的多项调查显示，许多员工将灵活性列为首要任务，甚至超过了薪酬。但是肯特大学社会学家Heejung Chung说，那些追求灵活性的人，被定义为对工作时间和地点的某种控制，可能会给自己带来麻烦。</p><p> In her book   The Flexibility Paradox , out March 4, Chung compiles her own research and that of hundreds of scholars to show that when workers are given flexibility, they generally work harder and longer—and they think more about work during non-work time. One analysis of 32,000 German workers found that those with control over their schedules logged four additional hours of overtime a week compared with people on fixed schedules. Another study using the same data showed that homeworking mothers in particular did more unpaid work, spending three more hours on childcare than their office-bound counterparts.</p><p>在3月4日出版的《灵活性悖论》（The Flexibility Paradox）一书中，钟整理了她自己和数百名学者的研究，以表明当工人获得灵活性时，他们通常会更加努力、更长时间地工作，并且在非工作时间会更多地考虑工作。一项对3.2万名德国工人的分析发现，与固定工作时间的人相比，那些能控制自己工作时间的人每周额外加班4小时。另一项使用相同数据的研究显示，在家工作的母亲尤其做了更多的无薪工作，比在办公室工作的母亲多花三个小时照顾孩子。</p><p> WIRED spoke to Chung about the reasons behind the phenomenon, how gender norms and parenting status can magnify the problem, possible solutions, and why, despite her findings, she supports flexible work.</p><p>WIRED采访了Chung，讲述了这一现象背后的原因、性别规范和育儿状况如何放大问题、可能的解决方案，以及为什么尽管她有发现，但她支持弹性工作。</p><p>   WIRED: You started writing the book before the pandemic. I don&#39;t imagine you could have predicted how timely it would become. What was your initial impetus?</p><p>连线：你在大流行之前就开始写这本书了。我不&#39；我无法想象你能预测它会变得多么及时。你最初的动力是什么？</p><p>  Heejung Chung: In management literature, flexible work has been hailed as this amazing thing that&#39;s really great for work-life balance and gender equality. There’s been a lot of government legislation to try to promote this. But we saw that people who had a huge amount of autonomy over where and when they work were not living in this promised land of better work-life balance and greater leisure time. So I tried to take a more critical look. I was able to observe in a much more systematic way, with large-scale data that yes, flexible working can actually lead workers to work longer and harder.</p><p>钟希荣：在管理学文献中，弹性工作被誉为一件神奇的事情&#39；It’这对工作生活平衡和性别平等非常好。有很多政府立法试图促进这一点。但我们看到，那些在工作地点和时间上拥有巨大自主权的人，并没有生活在这片工作与生活更平衡、休闲时间更多的应许之地。所以我试着用更挑剔的眼光看。我能够以一种更系统的方式观察到，通过大量数据，是的，弹性工作实际上可以让员工工作更长、更努力。</p><p>  Flexibility is about giving workers a choice over when and where they work. But you write about how those choices aren&#39;t as free as one might think, given the social contexts in which people are making them. Do you think people tend to overlook the broader forces influencing their behavior?</p><p>灵活性是指让员工在工作时间和地点上有选择权。但你写的是这些选择是如何&#39；考虑到人们制作它们的社会环境，它并不像人们想象的那么自由。你认为人们倾向于忽视影响他们行为的更广泛的力量吗？</p><p>  The thing is, many of us are living in societies with high levels of competition, great levels of insecurity, and a cultural belief that work should be your passion and that only through being very busy at work are you a worthwhile individual contributing to society. With the demise of the welfare state, it’s only through work that you can really gain most benefits. So the intensification of work actually comes from these embedded ideas about how one should live.</p><p>问题是，我们中的许多人生活在一个高度竞争、高度不安全的社会中，并且有一种文化信仰，即工作应该是你的激情，只有在工作非常繁忙的情况下，你才能成为一个有价值的人，为社会做出贡献。随着福利国家的消亡，只有通过工作，你才能真正获得最大的利益。因此，工作的强化实际上来自于这些关于一个人应该如何生活的根深蒂固的想法。</p><p> There&#39;s a theory called passion exploitation, where a passion for work enables us to exploit ourselves, but also for others to exploit us. If you look at the data, you see those attitudes about passion across a lot of occupations, and across countries as well. That&#39;s when it becomes a problem. It’s not only a select few that have this issue. It’s a much wider phenomenon.</p><p>那里&#39；这是一种叫做激情开发的理论，对工作的激情使我们能够开发自己，也让别人开发我们。如果你看这些数据，你会发现很多职业以及国家对激情的态度。那&#39；当它成为一个问题时。不仅仅是少数人有这个问题。这是一个更广泛的现象。</p><p>  You outline several theories behind the flexibility paradox, including what you call self exploitation. What does that mean?</p><p>你概述了灵活性悖论背后的几个理论，包括你所说的自我剥削。这是什么意思？</p><p> Our labor markets were built for our fathers in the 1950s, when it was assumed that you have a supporting spouse who can do all the reproductive work and all you need to do is work. There&#39;s an assumption that the person who can do that is productive, committed, and motivated, despite the fact that that&#39;s actually bullshit. There’s a negative connotation with flexible working, especially for those who have caring responsibilities. These tend more often to be mothers because of gender norms around whose responsibility it is to care and do housework. When that happens, people feel they have to work harder and longer to compensate for the stigmatized view.</p><p>我们的劳动力市场是在20世纪50年代为我们的父亲建立的，当时假设你有一个支持你的配偶，他可以做所有的生育工作，你需要做的就是工作。那里&#39；这是一种假设，认为能够做到这一点的人是有生产力的、有责任心的和有动力的，尽管事实上&#39；这其实是胡说八道。弹性工作有一个负面的含义，尤其是对于那些有关爱责任的人。这些人往往是母亲，因为围绕着她们的责任是照顾和做家务的性别规范。当这种情况发生时，人们觉得他们必须更努力、更长时间地工作，以弥补被污名化的观点。</p><p>  There are employers who are putting surveillance cameras on remote workers, which is completely ludicrous. They don&#39;t need employers to do it. Workers are surveilling themselves.</p><p>有些雇主在远程工作人员身上安装监控摄像头，这完全是荒谬的。他们没有&#39；不需要雇主来做。工人们在监视自己。</p><p> Do you think the prevalence of flexible work during the pandemic has done anything to reverse the flexibility stigma?</p><p>你认为流感大流行期间灵活工作的盛行有助于扭转人们对灵活工作的偏见吗？</p><p> If the majority of people work from home regularly, then some of those gender patterns might change. Still, I think there are unconscious biases against vulnerable workers—working mothers but also minority or disabled workers—where colleagues and managers will underestimate their capacities and flexible working may trigger biases. People are now slowly going back into the office, but those going back are majority white, male, heterosexual. Then you&#39;ll see a two-tiered market where people working from home are going to be penalized, and those in the office are going to get the promotions, the better projects, and be perceived more favorably by managers. So the way in which the hybrid workforce is implemented is really crucial. Because the pandemic has changed our norms about where work should be, but we still haven&#39;t tackled biases against certain workers. And it&#39;s not helped by Goldman Sachs’ CEO blurting out things like that  working from home is an aberration.</p><p>如果大多数人定期在家工作，那么其中一些性别模式可能会改变。尽管如此，我认为对弱势工人、职业母亲以及少数族裔或残疾工人存在无意识的偏见，同事和管理者会低估他们的能力，灵活的工作可能会引发偏见。人们现在慢慢地回到办公室，但那些回到办公室的人大多数是白人、男性、异性恋。然后你&#39；I’我将看到一个两级市场，在家工作的人将受到惩罚，在办公室工作的人将得到晋升，得到更好的项目，并被管理者更青睐。因此，混合劳动力的实施方式非常关键。因为大流行改变了我们关于工作地点的规范，但我们仍然没有&#39；t解决了对某些工人的偏见。它&#39；高盛（Goldman Sachs）首席执行官脱口而出，说在家工作是一种反常行为，这对他没有帮助。</p><p> You write that some of these external forces get reframed as personal choice through terms like workaholic. Do you think people who describe themselves as workaholics, which connotes addiction, are actually responding in a rational way to labor market pressures?</p><p>你写道，其中一些外部力量通过工作狂等术语被重新定义为个人选择。你认为那些自称是工作狂的人（这意味着上瘾）实际上是在以理性的方式应对劳动力市场的压力吗？</p><p>  I think the term workaholic is not very helpful because the problem isn&#39;t with the worker. The problem is with societal pressures and external factors. The US, the UK, Korea, and Japan are workaholic countries. But these are not inevitable facts of human societies. The term workaholic is putting the onus on the individual as if it&#39;s the individual&#39;s fault or an illness or choice. There may be some of that, but especially in certain countries, it goes beyond the individual. This is a societal illness.</p><p>我认为“工作狂”这个词没有多大帮助，因为问题不在于&#39；我和工人不在一起。问题在于社会压力和外部因素。美国、英国、韩国和日本都是工作狂国家。但这些并不是人类社会不可避免的事实。“工作狂”这个词是指把责任推到个人身上，就好像它&#39；是个人&#39；错误、疾病或选择。这其中可能有一些，但特别是在某些国家，它超越了个人。这是一种社会疾病。</p><p> Another societal pattern is intensive parenting, which relates again to market insecurities. Because of gender norms, women do a large chunk of the housework and childcare in heterosexual relationships. So they aren&#39;t able to exploit themselves as much in the labor market, but they are expected to—and do—exploit themselves at home. This means that working from home is used to expand childcare or housework hours. Mothers especially are considered the architects of children&#39;s futures, where if you don&#39;t invest in your children&#39;s lives through reading and talking and setting up the right playdates and extracurricular activities, you are not preparing your children for their future labor market prospects. It’s reached the point that now, full-time working mothers  spend more involved time with their children than housewives in the 1960s.</p><p>另一种社会模式是密集育儿，这又与市场不安全感有关。由于性别规范，女性在异性关系中做了大量家务和照顾孩子。所以他们不是&#39；他们无法在劳动力市场上充分利用自己，但他们被期望在国内充分利用自己。这意味着，在家工作被用来延长儿童保育或家务劳动时间。母亲尤其被认为是孩子的建筑师&#39；如果你不&#39；不要投资于你的孩子&#39；通过阅读和交谈，安排合适的玩耍时间和课外活动，你并没有为你的孩子未来的劳动力市场前景做好准备。现在，全职工作的母亲比20世纪60年代的家庭主妇花更多的时间陪伴孩子。</p><p>  Flexible working can help to reduce gender inequality by enabling mothers to stay in the labor market. But it can also reinforce traditional gender roles because it comes with the expectation that mothers will be able to do both housework and childcare while working from home. Whereas for fathers, because of gender normative views about them being breadwinners, working from home is expected to be a protected time and space where they shut themselves off and only focus on work.</p><p>灵活的工作方式可以让母亲留在劳动力市场，从而有助于减少性别不平等。但它也可以强化传统的性别角色，因为人们期望母亲在家工作时能够同时做家务和照顾孩子。而对于父亲来说，由于性别规范的观点认为他们是养家糊口的人，在家工作被认为是一个受保护的时间和空间，在那里，他们把自己关起来，只专注于工作。</p><p> One image from the book stuck with me: When mothers work from home, they tend to work in communal spaces, so they&#39;re spread out at the dining room table, accessible to the children, whereas fathers are shut away in private offices.</p><p>书中的一个画面让我印象深刻：当母亲在家工作时，她们往往在公共空间工作，所以她们&#39；在餐厅的餐桌上重新摆放，孩子们可以进入，而父亲们则被关在私人办公室里。</p><p>  If you look at the time-use diaries of mothers and fathers, mothers’ working hours are tainted, especially during the pandemic. But fathers are relatively protected because of their roles. And children won&#39;t expect fathers to be available when working from home, whereas they expect mothers to be mothers first. This is why employers will stigmatize mothers homeworking, and they might not for fathers.</p><p>如果你看一下母亲和父亲的时间使用日记，母亲的工作时间就会受到影响，尤其是在疫情期间。但由于父亲的角色，他们受到了相对的保护。孩子们赢了&#39；Don’’他们不希望父亲在家工作时有空，而他们希望母亲首先成为母亲。这就是为什么雇主会污蔑在家工作的母亲，而不是父亲。</p><p> I can imagine a progressive woman reading this and thinking, “That&#39;s not how it is in my house. I&#39;m the breadwinner, and my husband does the laundry.” In what ways could she still be affected by the gendered flexibility paradox?</p><p>我可以想象一个进步的女人读到这篇文章时会想，“我家不是这样的。我养家糊口，我丈夫洗衣服。”她还能在哪些方面受到性别灵活性悖论的影响？</p><p> Obviously, there’s some variation. But you&#39;ll probably find that women, when given the flexibility, will try to squeeze in as much housework and childcare, and weave in as many activities as possible, whereas fathers either won&#39;t, or use the excuse that their employers won’t let them. A lot of employers won&#39;t let mothers do that either. But mothers have no other option, so they might do it behind their bosses’ backs or they have to change jobs or drop out of the labor market altogether.</p><p>显然，有一些变化。但你&#39；I’我可能会发现，如果给予女性灵活性，她们会尽可能多地做家务和照顾孩子，并尽可能多地参与活动，而父亲则会赢得&#39；t、 或者用雇主不允许的借口。很多雇主都赢了&#39；我也不能让母亲那样做。但母亲们别无选择，所以她们可能会在老板背后这么做，或者不得不换工作或干脆退出劳动力市场。</p><p> You write that flexible work frees up “mothers’ labor for free” and “relieves governments of the need for a social response.” Was flexible work a consolation prize for working mothers who were demanding more government support?</p><p>你写道，弹性工作释放了“母亲的免费劳动”和“免除了政府对社会反应的需要”对于那些要求更多政府支持的职业母亲来说，弹性工作是一种安慰吗？</p><p>  It’s not a consolation prize, per se. But if you really want to push a lot of women into the labor market, you need to free them up because there’s only 24 hours a day. In Sweden and Denmark, children at age 1 have access to high-quality, affordable daycare. But childcare in the US and UK is extortionately expensive. If you give women the opportunities to work from home as well as flextime, we see that mothers can maintain their labor market position after having children, and if you don&#39;t give them that, about half of mothers will drop out, especially if they don&#39;t have very-high-quality, cheap childcare.</p><p>这本身不是一个安慰奖。但是如果你真的想让很多女性进入劳动力市场，你需要解放她们，因为一天只有24小时。在瑞典和丹麦，1岁的儿童可以获得高质量、负担得起的日托。但在美国和英国，儿童保育的费用过高。如果你给女性在家工作的机会以及弹性工作时间，我们可以看到母亲在生完孩子后可以保持她们在劳动力市场上的地位，如果你不&#39；如果他们不这么认为，大约一半的母亲会辍学，尤其是如果她们不辍学的话；我们没有高质量、低成本的托儿服务。</p><p>  In the northern European countries, where gender egalitarian norms and work-life balance norms are more prevalent, and family-friendly benefits are seen as the norm, you don&#39;t see the flexibility paradox or the flexibility stigma as much. Workers have strong negotiation power and a very secure social security net, which will provide up to 80 percent of your income when you&#39;re unemployed. These are contexts that help shape people&#39;s attitudes toward the centrality of work.</p><p>在北欧国家，性别平等主义规范和工作生活平衡规范更为普遍，家庭友好福利被视为规范，你不&#39；我看不出灵活性悖论或灵活性的耻辱。工人们有强大的谈判能力和非常安全的社会保障网，当你&#39；我们失业了。这些环境有助于塑造人&#39；他对工作中心的态度。</p><p> You write about flexible work leading not just to overtime, but to blurring of boundaries between work and life, which can lead to what you call cognitive spillover, where people constantly think about work. What are some of the new laws that start to address this?</p><p>你写的弹性工作不仅会导致加班，还会模糊工作和生活之间的界限，这可能会导致你所说的认知溢出，人们会不断思考工作。有哪些新法律开始解决这个问题？</p><p> I think the right to disconnect is really crucial. This isn&#39;t necessarily just about managers. If people respond to email just before bed or just after waking up, everybody starts unconsciously marching toward that always-on, always-available kind of culture. The right to disconnect helps workers not be exploited by employers, but also helps stop that culture from developing.</p><p>我认为断开连接的权利非常重要。这不是&#39；不一定只是关于经理。如果人们在睡前或刚起床后回复电子邮件，每个人都会开始无意识地走向那种永远持续、永远可用的文化。断开联系的权利有助于工人不被雇主剥削，但也有助于阻止这种文化的发展。</p><p>  Another thing is just general protection of workers. One reason why we are worried about work is there’s a high level of insecurity and lack of bargaining power. The European Commission introduced a series of policies barring discrimination against people who take up flexible working arrangements for parental needs. But there&#39;s also general protection, like making sure that workers are secure through better collective bargaining protections, and better legal protection in terms of job security.</p><p>另一件事就是对工人的全面保护。我们担心工作的一个原因是高度不安全，缺乏议价能力。欧盟委员会出台了一系列政策，禁止歧视那些因父母需要而采取灵活工作安排的人。但是有&#39；这也是一般性的保护，比如通过更好的集体谈判保护确保工人的安全，以及在工作保障方面更好的法律保护。</p><p> You don&#39;t dispense a lot of self-help-y advice, since there are so many books on the subject. But are there any tips that you picked up that worked especially well for you?</p><p>你没有&#39；I don’不要给出很多自助建议，因为这方面的书太多了。但是你有没有特别适合自己的技巧？</p><p>  Having allocated time for work can be much more productive. Rather than thinking, I could work until late because I&#39;m at home, really intentionally say no, I only have until 4:30. Those who are misusing flexible work so that your work blurs into the evening, you’ve got to question yourself: Is this really productive?</p><p>为工作分配时间会更有效率。我可以工作到很晚，而不是思考，因为我&#39；我在家，真的故意说不，我只有到4:30。那些滥用弹性工作以至于你的工作模糊到晚上的人，你必须扪心自问：这真的有效率吗？</p><p>  For women, because of the way we are socialized, you are going to feel like you need to do the housework and childcare while you&#39;re working from home. And I think you have to intentionally fight it. But also get your partner, if you have one, to try to use flexibility to enable a better work-life balance for both of you. Valentine&#39;s Day is coming up. Men, don&#39;t get your women flowers or lingerie. Get your manager to let you work some days from home, and use that flexibility to be a more involved father if you have children, be a more involved human if you have pets, do more housework. You&#39;ll find that it enhances your relationships, enhances your well-being. This is all empirical data-based evidence here.</p><p>对于女性来说，由于我们的社交方式，你会觉得你需要做家务和照顾孩子，而你&#39；我们在家工作。我认为你必须有意识地与之抗争。但如果你有伴侣，也要让你的伴侣试着利用灵活性，为你们两人实现更好的工作和生活平衡。瓦伦丁和#39；情人节就要到了。男人们，唐和#39；不要给你的女人买鲜花或内衣。让你的经理允许你在家工作几天，如果你有孩子，利用这种灵活性做一个更投入的父亲，如果你有宠物，做一个更投入的人，做更多的家务。你&#39；我会发现它能增进你的人际关系，增进你的幸福感。这些都是基于经验数据的证据。</p><p>  Flexible working is two things. One, it’s an equal opportunity maker. Because it provides people, especially those with responsibilities outside of work, the ability to better focus on what is important at work rather than the performance of being in the office. It can also really help democratize voices. In Zoom, we can&#39;t talk over each other. There&#39;s a raise hand option you can use so that certain voices are not dominating. But flexible working is also an amplifier. If workers feel that they have to work all the time, flexible work will amplify that. If we live in a society where the division of paid and unpaid work is unequal and the assumptions behind men’s and women&#39;s work commitments are skewed, it will amplify that. So flexible working is a great tool, but we need to change a lot of our normative views around work, work-life balance, and gender roles because otherwise it will keep amplifying a lot of the problems we have in our society.</p><p>灵活的工作是两件事。第一，它是一个机会均等的制造者。因为它让人们，尤其是那些在工作之外负有责任的人，能够更好地关注工作中重要的事情，而不是在办公室里的表现。它还可以真正帮助声音民主化。在Zoom中，我们可以&#39；不要互相争论。那里&#39；这是一个举手的选项，你可以使用，以便某些声音不占主导地位。但灵活的工作方式也是一个放大器。如果员工觉得他们必须一直工作，灵活的工作会加剧这种情况。如果我们生活在一个有薪和无薪工作分工不平等的社会，以及男女之间的假设&#39；美国的工作承诺是扭曲的，这将放大这一点。因此，灵活工作是一个很好的工具，但我们需要改变我们关于工作、工作生活平衡和性别角色的许多规范性观点，因为否则它将不断放大我们社会中的许多问题。</p><p>   ✨ Optimize your home life with our Gear team’s best picks, from  robot vacuums to  affordable mattresses to  smart speakers</p><p>✨ 从机器人吸尘器到价格合理的床垫，再到智能扬声器，我们的Gear团队提供最佳选择，优化您的家庭生活</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hours/">#hours</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
