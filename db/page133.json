", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51ccc39be54934eba67eff9d55cfe0b6.png", "infoid": 1066936, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Phabricator\u662f\u4e00\u7ec4\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 \u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u6258\u7ba1\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002  GitHub\u662f\u8d85\u8fc76500\u4e07\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7ef4\u57fa\u514b\u9686\u5982\u6b64\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002  \u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9\u5b83\u6bcf\u5929\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u95f2\u901b\u3002  \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002 \u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0cDEVOPS\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5236\u4f5c\u3002  Microsoft\u56e2\u961f\u662fMicrosoft 365\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u96c6\u7ebf\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002  Gitter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u957f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u793e\u533a\u3002 \nTutanota\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u79c1\u5bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002  \u5c06\u516c\u5171Web\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002  Outlook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u60a8\u7ba1\u7406\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e5\u5386\uff0c\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002  LucidChart\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u4eceJira\uff0cBitbucket\uff0cSonarqube\u6536\u96c6\u654f\u6377\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u5f39\u6027\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5728Kibana\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316  CLI\u5de5\u5177\u4eceJIRA\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff06amp;

Consequently, it has become important to pay attentionto these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We presentand motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thoroughsurvey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modelingtechniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We alsopresent an experiment-based guide along with code, for practitioners tooptimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the firstcomprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers thelandscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. Ourhope is that this survey would provide the reader with the mental model and thenecessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques toimmediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas forfurther research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:52:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "It took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since the early 2010\u2019s, it has been booming \u2014 and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java and JavaScript in popularity.\n But until when will that trend continue? When will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?\n Putting an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting Python\u2019s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.\n   Python\u2019s success is reflected in the  Stack Overflow trends, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform. Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.\n  While R has been plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline, Python\u2019s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are tagged \u201cpython\u201d, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for that.\n  Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn\u2019t only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large and supportive community.\n So if you have any issue while you\u2019re coding in Python, the odds are high that you\u2019ll be able to solve it with a single Google search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and written something helpful about it.\n  It\u2019s not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very human-readable.\n For starters, there\u2019s no need to specify the data type. You just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it\u2019s an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for beginners. If you\u2019ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is your program won\u2019t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.\n And if you\u2019ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you\u2019ll know how understandable Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it\u2019s a rather bumpy read compared to Python code.\n  Since Python has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose. These days, you can find a package for almost everything.\n Want to crunch numbers, vectors and matrices? NumPy is your guy. Want to do calculations for tech and engineering? Use SciPy. Want to go big in data manipulation and analysis? Give Pandas a go. Want to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use Scikit-Learn.\n Whichever computational task you\u2019re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments, can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.\n  Based on the previous elaborations, you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.\n  Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you\u2019ll need about 2\u201310 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language.\n There are  various reasons for that. One of them is that it\u2019s dynamically typed \u2014 remember that you don\u2019t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time.\n Another reason is that Python can only execute one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes \u2014 Python needs to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could mess that up.\n In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.\n But at the end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten so cheap that we\u2019re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn\u2019t really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.\n  Originally, Python was dynamically scoped. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.\n The problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every possible context \u2014 which is tedious. That\u2019s why most modern programming languages use static scoping.\n Python tried to transition to static scoping, but messed it up. Usually, inner scopes \u2014 for example functions within functions \u2014 would be able to see and change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.\n  Despite all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive. Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.\n On the other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means that Lambdas cannot be used for them.\n This distinction between expressions and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn\u2019t occur in other languages.\n   In Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code. This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.\n Other languages, for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.\n Newer languages like Haskell solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax for those who wish to go without.\n  As we\u2019re witnessing the shift from desktop to smartphone, it\u2019s clear that we need robust languages to build mobile software.\n But not many mobile apps are being developed with Python. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be done \u2014 there is a Python package called Kivy for this purpose.\n But Python wasn\u2019t made with mobile in mind. So even though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.\n To be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come. But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it\u2019s safe to say that learning Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.\n  A Python script isn\u2019t compiled first and then executed. Instead, it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a lot of tests. Like, a lot of tests.\n This is great for beginners since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.\n   Rust offers the same kind of safety that Python has \u2014 no variable can accidentally be overwritten. But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing. It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according to  StackOverflow Insights.\n Go is great for beginners like Python. And it is so simple that it\u2019s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go developers are among the  highest-paid programmers on the market.\n Julia is a very new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now, one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.\n While there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies, most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small, as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is clear: upwards.\n  Given the ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade, maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.\n Which of the languages it will be \u2014 Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future \u2014 is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.\n This article was written by \u00a0 Rhea Moutafis\u00a0and was originally published on \u00a0 Towards Data Science.

\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "In 1993, a media studies professor at Fordham University named Edward Wachtel visited several  famous caves in southern France, including Lascaux, Font-de-Gaume, Les Combarelles, and La Mouthe. His purpose: to study the cave art that has justly made these caves famous. \u00a0Wachtel was puzzled by what he called &#34;spaghetti lines&#34; on the drawings, partially obscuring them. There were also images of, say, an ibex with two heads, a mammal with three trunks, or a bull drawing superimposed over the drawing of a deer.\n His guide for the La Mouthe tour was a local farmer, and since there were no electric lights in this cave, the farmer brought along a gas lantern. When the farmer swung the lantern inside the cave, the color schemes shifted, and the engraved lines seemed to animate. &#34;Suddenly, the head of one creature stood out clearly,&#34; Wachtel recalled. &#34;It lived for a second, then faded as another appeared.&#34;\u00a0As for those mysterious spaghetti lines, &#34;they became a forest or a bramble patch that concealed and then reveled the animals within.&#34;\n Wachtel subsequently published a paper entitled, &#34; The First Picture Show: Cinematic Aspects of Cave Art,&#34; in which  he concluded that the cave drawings were meant to be perceived in three dimensions\u2014one of them being time. These could have been the first &#34;protomovies,&#34; he thought.\n It&#39;s an intriguing take, although it must be said that Wachtel&#39;s ideas are speculative. There is no way to definitively prove what those prehistoric cave artists intended, and therefore it&#39;s unwise to draw strong inferences about these being cinematic in nature, or to assume that this tells us anything about prehistoric artists&#39; conception of time. But his point about the importance of viewing cave paintings under the lighting conditions in which they were created and viewed in prehistoric times is sound.\n  Wachtel&#39;s story recently resurfaced in  a Twitter thread, and it couldn&#39;t be more timely. Lighting sources could indeed hold vital clues to the different ways prehistoric peoples used caves, according to\u00a0 a new paper\u00a0by a team of Spanish scientists, published in the journal PLOS ONE. They conducted  in situ experiments with three different kinds of Paleolithic lighting sources, in the hopes of shedding some light (pun intended) on what those various illumination methods might tell us about the emergence of &#34;human symbolic and artistic behavior&#34; in the form of cave art.\n There are nearly 350 such prehistoric caves in France and Spain alone, including the oldest cave painting yet known: a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Caceres, Spain, likely drawn by a Neanderthal some 64,000 years ago. (The oldest known depiction of an animal was discovered in 2018 on the island of Borneo in Indonesia, dating back 40,000 years.)\u00a0The Spanish team chose to conduct their experiments at the Isuntza 1 Cave in Spain&#39;s Basque country, and selected two distinct spaces in particular.\n    The first was a large, wide chamber with walls of bedrock, with 99.7 percent relative humidity and an average temperature of 17.6 degrees C (63.6 degrees F). \u00a0They thought it would be ideal as a &#34;staying chamber&#34; for the experiments The second space was a second, slightly smaller chamber with similar relative humidity (99.9 percent) and average temperatures (14.2 degrees C, or 57.5 degrees F) similar to the first space.\u00a0The two spaces are connected by a rough passage 40 meters long (about 131 feet).\n  The Spanish researchers chose lighting types for their eight experiments based on known archaeological data: five torches tested in both spaces and the passage, as well as two stone lamps with animal fat, and a small fireplace, both tested just in the first space. All the torches were made from dry juniper branches joined together, like the remains of ancient torches found in the Aldene and Reseau Clastres caves. The researchers included a bit of birch to act as tinder, and added pine resin, animal fat, or a combination thereof to assess how well different fuel types worked.\n The lamps were replicas of a sandstone lamp found in La Mouthe Cave in Dordogne, France. They used bovine animal fat as fuel, with three juniper wicks, arranged in a teepee shape inside the lamp. They also built a small fireplace on a clay substrate in the first chamber with juniper and oak as wood fuel.\n For all the lighting experiments, the team measured how long the lighting source lasted (duration); the total amount of light reaching a specific surface or point relative to the human eye (illuminance, or lux); how much illumination was emitted in certain directions (luminous intensity); the minimum distance between the light source and total darkness (action radius); and luminance, which connects light intensity with the surface of the source. They also kept track of the highest temperature reached by each type of lighting source.\n    Those measurements showed that the various lighting sources had very different characteristics, and thus were probably used in different contexts. The wooden torches, for instance, emitted light in all directions, up to nearly six meters (19.6 feet), and lasted an average of 41 minutes. The torches exhibited uneven light intensity, and often needed to be relit by waving them from side to side, and they produced a lot smoke. So they worked best for exploring caves or crossing wide spaces. The team also found that adding resin intensified the flame, while adding animal fat extended its duration.\n    In contrast, the grease lamps emitted weaker light akin to the intensity of a candle, over a span of three meters (9.8 feet) or so. They burned consistently, and didn&#39;t smoke, for over an hour, but they had a dazzling effect if the person was moving and didn&#39;t illuminate the floor very well. Also, &#34;It was necessary to maintain constant control over the wick to prevent it from sinking into the fatty fuel, causing the flame to be extinguished,&#34; the authors wrote. This makes the lamps better suited for lighting small cave spaces over a longer period, complementing the advantages of the torches.\n As for the fireplace\u2014the only truly static system\u2014its illumination covered a range of 6.6 meters (21.6 feet). However, it burned for just 30 minutes and gave off a lot of white smoke, making it unsuitable for use unless there were strong enough air currents to disperse that smoke. &#34;The fireplace location was not appropriately placed regarding air currents,&#34; the authors noted, which are &#34;essential to achieving a prolonged stay underground. However, in the case of large fires, convection currents are produced, and they would be efficient enough to evacuate gases outside of the cave.&#34;\n The Spanish team also built a virtual 3D model of a section of the Atxurra cave known as the Ledge of the Horses. It&#39;s a naturally formed platform just above a passage floor, with two panels of about 50 animal engravings: bison, goats, horses, and hinds, many of them overlapping. The ledge was also littered with scattered charcoal, lithic tools, and ashes from three probable fireplaces. In the virtual model, they conducted a spatial analysis of all three tested lighting sources.\n    The modeling showed that the decorated panels would be &#34;barely perceptible&#34; to someone standing in the lower parts of the gallery, even if that person were carrying a lamp or a torch. It would need to be illuminated from the top of the ledge to be seen. In contrast, the fireplaces appeared to be strategically located to illuminate the entire decorated space. Torches did prove to be a good lighting source for accessing that space, however, with an estimated travel time of 38.39 minutes\u2014in line with the measured duration of the torches. &#34;It does not seem by chance that the optimal routes estimated to access this space are covered with scattered charcoals, surely fallen from the torches used in the Magdalenian period,&#34; the authors wrote.\n The findings have no direct bearing on Wachtel&#39;s speculation about prehistoric cinematic art. But the more archaeologists learn about Paleolithic lighting sources, the more we will understand about how those lighting sources affect human perception in a cave environment, with implications for the emergence of cave art. That&#39;s why the Spanish team thinks it is essential to continue conducting these kinds of experiments.\n &#34;Only with a large corpus of archaeological remains, including different types of lighting systems (and fuels), studied through an interdisciplinary approach, will it be possible to adequately reproduce Paleolithic light resources,&#34; they concluded in their paper, &#34;Our experiments in Paleolithic lighting point to planning in the human use of caves in this period, and the importance of lighting studies to travel the activities carried out by our ancestors in the deep areas of caves. &#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:15:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6d1e\u7a74,recreated", "title": "\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u5bb6\u91cd\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u65e7\u77f3\u5668\u65f6\u4ee3\u6d1e\u7a74\u7167\u660e ", "title_en": "Archaeologists recreated three common kinds of Paleolithic cave lighting", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/archaeologists-recreated-three-common-kinds-of-paleolithic-cave-lighting/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d1e\u7a74", "recreated"]}]
