That often feels like the defining fact about my life. When I joined the company after college in 2015, it was at the start of a multiyear reign atop Forbes’s list of best workplaces.</p><p>我曾经是谷歌工程师。这通常感觉像关于我生命的决定事实。当我在2015年大学后加入公司时，它是在福布斯最佳工作场所列表中的一个多年统治的开始。</p><p> I bought into the Google dream completely. In high school, I spent time homeless and in foster care, and was often ostracized for being nerdy. I longed for the prestige of a blue-chip job, the security it would bring and a collegial environment where I would work alongside people as driven as I was.</p><p> 我完全买入谷歌梦想。在高中，我花时间无家可归，养育，并且经常被排斥为讨厌。我渴望了一个蓝筹工作的声望，它会带来的安全和一个学院环境，我将与我一样与人一起工作。</p><p> What I found was a surrogate family. During the week, I ate all my meals at the office. I went to the Google doctor and the Google gym. My colleagues and I piled into Airbnbs on business trips, played volleyball in Maui after a big product launch and even spent weekends together, once paying $170 and driving hours to run an obstacle course in the freezing rain.</p><p> 我发现的是代理家庭。在本周，我在办公室吃了所有的饭菜。我去了谷歌医生和谷歌健身房。我的同事和我堆积在商务旅行中，在毛伊发布了大型产品发射，甚至共同度过了毛伊岛，曾在冰冻的雨中支付障碍课程，在毛伊岛上发挥排球。</p><p> My manager felt like the father I wished I’d had. He believed in my potential and cared about my feelings. All I wanted was to keep getting promoted so that as his star rose, we could keep working together. This gave purpose to every task, no matter how grueling or tedious.</p><p> 我的经理喜欢我所希望的父亲。他相信我的潜力和关心我的感受。我想要的只是继续推动，以便作为他的明星玫瑰，我们可以继续努力。无论多么艰难或乏味，这对每项任务都提供了目的。</p><p>  The few people who’d worked at other companies reminded us that there was nowhere better. I believed them, even when my technical lead — not my manager, but the man in charge of my day-to-day work — addressed me as “beautiful” and “gorgeous,” even after I asked him to stop. (Finally, I agreed that he could call me “my queen.”) He used many of our one-on-one meetings to ask me to set him up with friends, then said he wanted “A blonde. A tall blonde.” Someone who looked like me.</p><p>  少数人在其他公司工作的人提醒我们，没有更好的地方。我相信他们，即使我的技术领导 - 不是我的经理，而是负责我日常工作的人 - 致以“美丽”和“华丽”，即使我让他停止。 （最后，我同意他可以称我为“我的女王”。）他使用了许多一对一的会议，要求我和朋友一起举行他，然后说他想要“一个金发女郎。一个高大的金发女郎。“一个看起来像我的人。</p><p> Saying anything about his behavior meant challenging the story we told ourselves about Google being so special. The company anticipated our every need — nap pods, massage chairs, Q-Tips in the bathroom, a shuttle system to compensate for the Bay Area’s dysfunctional public transportation — until the outside world began to seem hostile. Google was the Garden of Eden; I lived in fear of being cast out.</p><p> 对他的行为说到一些关于我们告诉我们谷歌这么特别的故事的挑战。公司预计我们的每一种需求 - 午睡豆荚，按摩椅，浴室，Q-Tips，养老系统，以弥补湾区的功能失调的公共交通 - 直到外界开始看起来令人敌意。谷歌是伊甸园;我害怕被抛弃。</p><p> When I talked to outsiders about the harassment, they couldn’t understand: I had one of the sexiest jobs in the world. How bad could it be? I asked myself this, too. I worried that I was taking things personally and that if anyone knew I was upset, they’d think I wasn’t tough enough to hack it in our intense environment.</p><p> 当我与外人谈论骚扰时，他们无法理解：我有世界上最性感的工作之一。到底能有多糟糕？我也问自己。我担心我个人拿东西，如果有人知道我很沮丧，他们就会认为我不够坚硬地在激烈的环境中破解它。 </p><p> So I didn’t tell my manager about my tech lead’s behavior for more than a year. Playing along felt like the price of inclusion. I spoke up only when it looked like he would become an official manager — my manager — replacing the one I adored and wielding even more power over me. At least four other women said that he’d made them uncomfortable, in addition to two senior engineers who already made it clear that they wouldn’t work with him.</p><p>所以我没有告诉我的经理关于我的技术领先的行为一年多。觉得觉得就像包含的价格一样。只有当它看起来像是一名官方经理时，我才会发表讲话 - 我的经理 - 更换我崇拜的人，挥舞更多的权力。至少有四名女性表示，除了两位高级工程师已经明确表示他们不与他不合作的高级工程师之外，他也会让他们感到不舒服。</p><p> As soon as my complaint with H.R. was filed, Google went from being a great workplace to being any other company: It would protect itself first. I’d structured my life around my job — exactly what they wanted me to do — but that only made the fallout worse when I learned that the workplace that I cherished considered me just an employee, one of many and disposable.</p><p> 一旦我的投诉，就被提交了，谷歌就是成为任何其他公司的伟大工作场所：它将首先保护自己。我围绕着我的工作，完全是他们想要我做的事情 - 但是当我了解到我珍惜的工作场所只是一个员工，许多和一次性的工作场所才会变得更糟。</p><p> The process stretched out for nearly three months. In the meantime I had to have one-on-one meetings with my harasser and sit next to him. Every time I asked for an update on the timeline and expressed my discomfort at having to continue to work in proximity to my harasser, the investigators said that I could seek counseling, work from home or go on leave. I later learned that Google had similar responses to other employees who reported racism or sexism.  Claire Stapleton, one of the  2018 walkout organizers, was encouraged to take leave, and  Timnit Gebru, a lead researcher on Google’s Ethical AI team, was encouraged to seek mental health care before being forced out.</p><p> 该过程延伸出近三个月。与此同时，我不得不与骚扰者一对一的会议，坐在他旁边。每次我要求在时间表上进行更新并表示我不必继续靠近我的骚扰者时，调查人员表示我可以寻求咨询，从家里工作或继续休假。我后来才了解到谷歌对报告种族主义或性别歧视的其他员工进行了类似的回应。克莱尔斯塔彭（Claire Stapleton）鼓励谷歌道德AI团队的领导研究员休假之一，并鼓励谷歌族裔队的主要研究员休假，并鼓励在被迫出去之前寻求精神医疗保健。</p><p> I resisted. How would being alone by myself all day, apart from my colleagues, friends and support system, possibly help? And I feared that if I stepped away, the company wouldn’t continue the investigation.</p><p> 我抵制了。除了我的同事，朋友和支持系统，可能有帮助吗？而且我担心如果我徒步离开，公司就不会继续调查。</p><p> Eventually, the investigators corroborated my claims and found my tech lead violated the Code of Conduct and the policy against harassment. My harasser still sat next to me. My manager told me H.R. wouldn’t even make him change his desk, let alone work from home or go on leave. He also told me that my harasser received a consequence that was severe and that I would feel better if I could know what it was, but it sure seemed like nothing happened.</p><p> 最终，调查人员证实了我的索赔，发现我的技术领先违反了行为准则和防止骚扰政策。我的骚扰者仍然坐在我旁边。我的经理告诉我，H.R.甚至不会让他改变他的办公桌，更不用说从家里工作或休假。他还告诉我，我的骚扰者得到了严重的结果，如果我知道它是什么，我会感觉更好，但它肯定似乎没有任何事情发生。</p><p> The aftermath of speaking up had broken me down. It dredged up the betrayals of my past that I’d gone into tech trying to overcome. I’d made myself vulnerable to my manager and the investigators but felt I got nothing solid in return. I was constantly on edge from seeing my harasser in the hallways and at the cafes. When people came up behind my desk, I startled more and more easily, my scream echoing across the open-floor-plan office. I worried I’d get a poor performance review, ruining my upward trajectory and setting my career back even further.</p><p> 说话的后果让我失望了。它疏排了我过去的背叛，我进入科技试图克服。我让自己容易受到我的经理和调查人员的影响，但觉得我没有得到了坚实的回报。在走廊和咖啡厅，我不断地看到我的骚扰者。当人们在桌子后面来到我的桌子后，我越来越容易惊讶，我的尖叫声横跨开放式办公室。我担心我会得到一个糟糕的绩效审查，毁了我向上的轨迹并进一步让我的职业生涯。</p><p>  I decided to take three months of paid leave.  I feared that going on leave would set me back for promotion in a place where almost everyone’s progress is public and seen as a measure of an engineer’s worth and expertise. Like most of my colleagues, I’d built my life around the company. It could so easily be taken away. People on leave weren’t supposed to enter the office — where I went to the gym and had my entire social life.</p><p>  我决定需要三个月的带薪假。我担心休假会让我回到一个几乎每个人进步的地方的晋升，并被视为衡量工程师的价值和专业知识的衡量标准。像我的大多数同事一样，我会在公司周围建造我的生活。它可以很容易地被带走。休假的人不应该进入办公室 - 我去健身房的地方，拥有我的整个社交生活。 </p><p> Fortunately, I still had a job when I got back. If anything, I was more eager than ever to excel, to make up for lost time. I was able to earn a very high performance rating — my second in a row. But it seemed clear I would not be a candidate for promotion. After my leave, the manager I loved started treating me as fragile. He tried to analyze me, suggesting that I drank too much caffeine, didn’t sleep enough or needed more cardiovascular exercise. Speaking out irreparably damaged one of my most treasured relationships. Six months after my return, when I broached the subject of promotion, he told me, “People in wood houses shouldn’t light matches.”</p><p>幸运的是，当我回来时，我还有一份工作。如果有的话，我比以往任何时候都更渴望，弥补失去的时间。我能够赚取非常高的绩效评级 - 我的第二次连续。但它似乎很清楚，我不会成为推广的候选人。我离开后，我爱的经理开始把我视为脆弱。他试图分析我，表明我喝了太多的咖啡因，没有睡得足够或需要更多的心血管运动。说出我最珍贵的关系中的一个不可挽回的损坏。回到六个月后，当我引导晋升的主题时，他告诉我，“木屋里的人不应该亮相。”</p><p> When I didn’t get a promotion, some of my stock grants ran out and so I effectively took a big pay cut. Nevertheless, I wanted to stay at Google. I still believed, despite everything, that Google was the best company in the world. Now I see that my judgment was clouded, but after years of idolizing my workplace, I couldn’t imagine life beyond its walls.</p><p> 当我没有得到促销时，我的一些股票补助金耗尽，所以我有效地削减了一个大的工资。尽管如此，我想留在谷歌。我仍然相信，尽管一切，谷歌是世界上最好的公司。现在我看到我的判断是蒙上的，但经过多年的崇拜工作场所，我无法想象超越其墙壁的生活。</p><p> So I interviewed with and got offers from two other top tech companies, hoping that Google would match. In response, Google offered me slightly more money than I was making, but it was still significantly less than my competing offers. I was told that the Google finance office calculated what I was worth to the company.  I couldn’t help thinking that this calculus included the complaint I’d filed and the time I’d taken off as a consequence.</p><p> 所以我采访了另外两家顶尖技术公司的提交，希望谷歌会匹配。作为回应，谷歌向我提供比我所做的更多钱，但它仍然明显低于我的竞争优惠。我被告知，谷歌财政办公室计算了我对公司的价值。我忍不住认为这种微积分包括我提出的投诉以及后果所取得的时间。</p><p> I felt I had no choice but to leave, this time for good. Google’s meager counteroffer was final proof that this job was just a job and that I’d be more valued if I went elsewhere.</p><p> 我觉得我别无选择，只能离开，这次是为了好。谷歌的微薄反应是最终证明这项工作只是一份工作，如果我去其他地方，我会更加重视。</p><p> After I quit, I promised myself to never love a job again. Not in the way I loved Google. Not with the devotion businesses wish to inspire when they provide for employees’ most basic needs like food and health care and belonging. No publicly traded company is a family. I fell for the fantasy that it could be.</p><p> 在我退出之后，我答应自己再也不会爱工作。不是我喜欢谷歌的方式。没有奉献企业希望在为食品和医疗保健和归属等员工提供最基本的需求时激发激励。没有公开交易公司是一个家庭。我为幻想摔倒了。</p><p> So I took a role at a firm to which I felt no emotional attachment. I like my colleagues, but I’ve never met them in person. I found my own doctor; I cook my own food. My manager is 26 — too young for me to expect any parental warmth from him. When people ask me how I feel about my new position, I shrug: It’s a job.</p><p> 所以我在一家坚定的公司中发挥了作用，我感到没有情绪依恋。我喜欢我的同事，但我从未亲自见过他们。我找到了自己的医生;我烹饪自己的食物。我的经理26  - 太年轻，对我来说是期待他的任何父母的温暖。当人们问我如何感受我的新职位时，我耸耸肩：这是一份工作。</p><p> Emi Nietfeld is a software engineer in New York City and the author of a forthcoming memoir, “Acceptance.” She is working on a book about her time at Google.</p><p> EMI Nietfeld是纽约市的软件工程师，即即将发票的作者“接受”。她正在努力在谷歌的一本关于她的时间。 </p><p> The Times is committed to publishing   a diversity of letters  to the editor.
