He leapt out of bed to find his wife, Gabriela, passed out, her forehead hot with the same fever that had stricken him and his son, Orlando Jr., then 3, just hours before. Two days later, it would hit their infant daughter, Veronica.</p><p>在酷暑的夜晚，凌晨2点左右，奥兰多·加纳博士（Orlando Garner）醒来，他小女儿的婴儿床旁边传来一阵轰鸣声。他跳下床，发现妻子加布里埃拉（Gabriela）昏倒了，她的额头因发烧而发烧，当时他和他的儿子奥兰多（Orlando Jr.）遭受了同样的痛苦，然后才三个小时。两天后，这将打击他们的幼女Veronica。</p><p> Nearly five months later, Dr. Garner, a critical care physician at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, is haunted by what befell his family last summer: He had inadvertently shuttled the coronavirus home, and sickened them all.</p><p> 近五个月后，休斯敦贝勒医学院的重症监护医生加纳医生因去年夏天家人遭受的困扰而感到困扰：他无意中将冠状病毒穿梭在家里，使所有人都感到不适。</p><p> “I felt so guilty,” he said. “This is my job, what I wanted to do for a living. And it could have killed my children, could have killed my wife — all this, because of me.”</p><p> 他说：“我感到内gui。” “这是我的工作，我想做的就是谋生。它可能杀了我的孩子，可能杀了我的妻子-所有这些，都是因为我。”</p><p> With the case count climbing again in Texas, Dr. Garner has recurring nightmares that one of his children has died from Covid. He’s returned to 80-hour weeks in the intensive care unit, donning layers of pandemic garb including goggles, an N95 respirator, a protective body suit and a helmet-like face shield that forces him to yell to be heard.</p><p> 随着得克萨斯州的病例数再次攀升，加纳博士反复发生噩梦，说他的一个孩子死于科维德。他回到了重症监护室，每周工作80个小时，穿上几层大风衣，包括护目镜，N95呼吸器，防护服和头盔式面罩，迫使他大喊大叫。</p><p> As he treats one patient after another, he can’t shake the fear that his first bout with the coronavirus won’t be his last, even though reinfection is rare: “Is this going to be the one who gives me Covid again?”</p><p> 当他接连治疗一名患者时，即使再感染极少发生，他也无法摆脱对第一次使用冠状病毒的回弹的恐惧：“难道这将再次给我带来Covid吗？”</p><p> Frontline health care workers have been the one constant, the medical soldiers forming row after row in the ground war against the raging spread of the coronavirus. But as cases and deaths  shatter daily records, foreshadowing one of the deadliest years in American history, the very people whose life mission is caring for others are on the verge of collective collapse.</p><p> 一线医护人员一直是一个不变的人，医务人员在地面上战胜了冠状病毒的肆虐蔓延，一排排地作战。但是，随着案件和死亡打破每日记录，预示着美国历史上最致命的年份之一，那些以人生使命为生的人正处于集体崩溃的边缘。</p><p> In interviews, more than two dozen frontline medical workers described the unrelenting stress that has become an endemic part of the health care crisis nationwide. Many related  spikes in anxiety and depressive thoughts, as well as a  chronic sense of hopelessness and deepening fatigue, spurred in part by the cavalier attitudes of many Americans who seem to have lost patience with the pandemic.</p><p> 在采访中，超过二十名一线医务人员描述了这种持续不断的压力，这种压力已经成为全国医疗保健危机的流行部分。许多相关的焦虑和抑郁念头激增，以及长期的绝望感和日益加深的疲劳感，部分原因是许多美国人似乎对大流行病失去了耐心，他们的态度更加勇敢。</p><p>  Surveys from around the globe have recorded  rising rates of  depression,  trauma and  burnout among a group of professionals already known for  high rates of suicide. And while some have sought therapy or medications to cope, others fear that engaging in these support systems could blemish their records and dissuade future employers from hiring them.</p><p>来自全球的调查表明，在以自杀率很高而闻名的一群专业人士中，抑郁，创伤和倦怠的发生率正在上升。尽管有些人寻求治疗或药物来应对，但另一些人则担心参与这些支持系统可能会破坏他们的记录，并阻止未来的雇主雇用他们。</p><p> “We’re sacrificing so much as health care providers — our health, our family’s health,” said Dr. Cleavon Gilman, an emergency medicine physician in Yuma, Ariz. “You would think that the country would have learned its lesson” after the spring, he said. “But I feel like the 20,000 people that died in New York died for nothing.”</p><p> 亚利桑那州尤马市的急诊医学医师克里夫·吉尔曼（Cleavon Gilman）博士说：“我们在牺牲医疗保健提供者的同时，付出了巨大的代价，我们的健康，我们的家庭的健康。他说，春天。 “但我觉得在纽约死去的2万人无缘无故死了。”</p><p> Many have reached the bottom of their reservoir, with little left to give, especially without sufficient tools to defend themselves against a disease that  has killed more than 1,000 of them.</p><p> 许多人已经到达水库的底部，几乎没有余力，特别是在没有足够的工具来抵御已经杀死了1000多个人的疾病的情况下。</p><p> “I haven’t even thought about how I am today,” said Dr. Susannah Hills, a pediatric head and neck surgeon at Columbia University. “I can’t think of the last time somebody asked me that question.”</p><p> 哥伦比亚大学儿科头颈外科医生Susannah Hills博士说：“我什至都没有想过今天的样子。” “我想不起来上次有人问我这个问题。”</p><p>  For Dr. Shannon Tapia, a geriatrician in Colorado, April was bad. So was May. At one long-term care facility she staffed, 22 people died in 10 days. “After that number, I stopped counting,” she said.</p><p>  对于科罗拉多州的一位老年医师Shannon Tapia博士来说，四月是糟糕的。五月也是如此。她在一个长期护理机构工作，在10天内有22人死亡。她说：“在这个数字之后，我不再计数了。”</p><p> A bit of a lull coasted in on a wave of summer heat. But in recent weeks, Dr. Tapia has watched the virus resurge, sparking sudden outbreaks and felling nursing home residents —  one of the pandemic’s most hard-hit populations — in droves.</p><p> 一阵平静在夏天的热浪中袭来。但是在最近几周里，塔皮亚博士目睹了这种病毒的重新流行，引发了突发性暴发，并使成群的养老院居民（大流行病最重的人口之一）丧生。</p><p> “This is much, much worse than the spring,” Dr. Tapia said. “Covid is going crazy in Colorado right now.”</p><p> 塔皮亚博士说：“这比春天差很多，”。 “ Covid现在在科罗拉多州将变得疯狂。”</p><p> Dr. Tapia bore witness as long-term care facilities struggled to keep adequate protective equipment in stock, and decried their lack of adequate tests. As recently as early November, diagnostic tests at one home Dr. Tapia regularly visits took more than a week to deliver results, hastening the spread of the virus among unwitting residents.</p><p>Tapia博士为长期护理机构努力保持库存足够的防护设备而作证，并谴责缺乏适当的测试。直到11月初，塔皮亚（Tapia）博士定期探访一间房屋进行的诊断测试都花了一个多星期的时间才能得出结果，从而加快了病毒在不知情者中的传播。</p><p> Some nursing home residents in the Denver area are getting bounced out of full hospitals because their symptoms aren’t severe, only to rapidly deteriorate and die in their care facilities. “It just happens so fast,” Dr. Tapia said. “There’s no time to send them back.”</p><p> 丹佛地区的一些疗养院居民因症状不严重而被迅速送出医院，只是症状迅速恶化并在护理设施中死亡。塔皮亚博士说：“事情发生得如此之快。” “没有时间将它们寄回。”</p><p> The evening of Nov. 17, Dr. Tapia fielded phone call after phone call from nursing homes brimming with the sick and the scared. Four patients died between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. “It was the most death pronouncements I’ve ever had to do in one night,” she said.</p><p> 11月17日晚上，塔皮亚医生接到了满是病人和恐惧者的疗养院的电话。 4名患者在下午5点之间死亡。她说：“这是我一晚上不得不做的最多的死亡宣告。”</p><p> Before the pandemic, nursing home residents were already considered a medically neglected population. But the coronavirus has only exacerbated a worrisome chasm of care for older patients. Dr. Tapia is beleaguered by the helplessness she feels at every turn. “Systematically, it makes me feel like I’m failing,” she said. “The last eight months almost broke me.”</p><p> 在大流行之前，疗养院的居民已经被视为医学上被忽视的人群。但是，冠状病毒只会加剧老年患者的令人担忧的护理鸿沟。 Tapia博士为她动turn的无助所困扰。她说：“从系统上来说，这让我感到自己失败了。” “最近八个月差点让我失望。”</p><p> At the end of the summer, Dr. Tapia briefly considered leaving medicine — but she is a single parent to an 11-year-old son, Liam. “I need my M.D. to support my kid,” she said.</p><p> 暑假结束时，塔皮亚医生（Tapia）曾短暂考虑过退出药物治疗-但她是11岁儿子利亚姆（Liam）的单亲父母。她说：“我需要医学博士来养育我的孩子。”</p><p>  Dr. Gilman, the emergency medicine physician in Yuma, braced himself at the beginning of the pandemic, relying on his stint as a hospital corpsman in Iraq in 2004.</p><p>  尤马市急诊医学医师吉尔曼（Gilman）博士在大流行初期就做好了准备，依靠他在2004年担任伊拉克医院军官的经历。</p><p> “In the military, they train you to do sleep deprivation, hikes, marches,” he said. “You train your body, you fight an enemy. I began running every day, getting my lungs strong in case I got the virus. I put a box by the door to put my clothes in, so I wouldn’t spread it to my family.”</p><p> 他说：“在军队中，他们训练您进行睡眠剥夺，远足，游行。” “您训练自己的身体，与敌人作战。我每天开始跑步，以防万一我感染了病毒。我在门口放了一个箱子来放衣服，这样就不会把它散给我的家人了。”</p><p> The current crisis turned out to be an unfamiliar and formidable foe that would follow him from place to place.</p><p>事实证明，当前的危机是一个陌生而强大的敌人，他将随处可见。</p><p> Dr. Gilman’s first coronavirus tour began as a resident at New York-Presbyterian at the height of last spring. He came to dread the phone calls to families unable to be near their ailing relatives, hearing “the same shrill cry, two or three times per shift,” he said. Months of chaos, suffering and pain, he said, left him “just down and depressed and exhausted.”</p><p> 吉尔曼博士的首个冠状病毒之旅始于去年春天高峰时在纽约长老会的居民。他说，他害怕无法打电话给无法与患病亲戚的家人联系的电话，听到“同样尖刻的哭声，每班两到三遍，”他说。他说，数月的混乱，痛苦和痛苦使他“跌落，沮丧，疲惫”。</p><p> “I would come home with tears in my eyes, and just pass out,” he said.</p><p> 他说：“我会流着眼泪回家，然后昏倒。”</p><p>  Dr. Gilman canceled his wedding in May. His June graduation commenced on Zoom. He celebrated the end of his residency in his empty apartment next to a pile of boxes.</p><p>  吉尔曼博士在五月取消了他的婚礼。他的六月毕业于Zoom开始。他在一堆箱子旁边的空公寓里庆祝居住的结束。</p><p>  Within weeks, he, his fiancée, Maribel, their two daughters and his mother-in-law had relocated to Arizona, where caseloads had just begun to swell. Dr. Gilman hunkered down anew.</p><p>  几周之内，他，未婚夫，马里贝尔（Maribel），他们的两个女儿和他的岳母搬到亚利桑那州，那里的案件数量才开始激增。吉尔曼博士重新屈服了。</p><p> They have weathered the months since in seclusion, keeping the children out of school and declining invitations to mingle, even as their neighbors begin to flock back together and buzz about their holiday plans.</p><p> 自从隐居以来，他们度过了几个月的风雨，即使邻居们开始蜂拥而至，并为他们的假期计划而嗡嗡作响，他们都让孩子们脱离了学校，并且拒绝参加聚会的邀请。</p><p> There are bright spots, he said. The family’s home, which they moved into this summer, is large, and came with a pool. They recently adopted a puppy. Out in the remoteness of small-town Arizona, the desert has delighted them with the occasional roadrunner sighting.</p><p> 他说，这里有很多亮点。他们今年夏天搬进来的这个家庭的房子很大，有一个游泳池。他们最近收养了一只小狗。在亚利桑那州小镇的偏远地区，偶尔看到行人的路过，沙漠使他们感到高兴。</p><p> Since the spring, Dr. Gilman has become a social media tour de force. To document the ongoing crisis, he began publishing journal entries on his website. His  Twitter wall teems with posts commemorating people who lost their lives to Covid-19, and the health workers who have dedicated the past nine months to stemming the tide.</p><p>从春季开始，吉尔曼（Gilman）博士已成为社交媒体的不可或缺的一环。为了记录持续的危机，他开始在自己的网站上发布日记条目。他的Twitter墙上满是帖子，以纪念那些因Covid-19丧生的人们以及过去九个月致力于遏制潮流的卫生工作者。</p><p> It’s how he has made sense of the chaos, Dr. Gilman said. What he’s fighting isn’t just the virus itself — but a contagion of disillusionment and misinformation, amid which mask-wearing and distancing continue to flag. “It’s a constant battle, it’s a never-ending war,” he said.</p><p> 吉尔曼博士说，这就是他对混乱的理解。他所争取的不仅是病毒本身，还包括幻灭感和错误信息的蔓延，在这种情况下，戴着口罩和疏散口罩的现象不断出现。他说：“这是一场持续不断的战斗，这是一场永无止境的战争。”</p><p>  Nurses and doctors in New York became all too familiar with the rationing of care last spring. No training prepared them for the wrath of the virus, and its aftermath. The month-to-month, day-to-day flailing about as they tried to cope. For some, the weight of the pandemic will have lingering effects.</p><p>  去年春天，纽约的护士和医生对护理的定量分配变得非常熟悉。没有培训可以使他们为病毒的愤怒及其后果做好准备。他们试图应对的月复一日，日复一日地挣扎。对于某些人来说，大流行的重担将挥之不去。</p><p> Shikha Dass, an emergency room nurse at Mount Sinai Queens, recalled nights in mid-March when her team of eight nurses had to wrangle some 15 patients each — double or triple a typical workload. “We kept getting code after code, and patients were just dying,” Ms. Dass said. The patients quickly outnumbered the available breathing support machines, she said, forcing doctors and nurses to apportion care in a rapid-fire fashion.</p><p> 西奈山皇后医院急诊室护士Shikha Dass回忆起3月中旬的夜晚，当时她的八名护士组成的小组不得不纠缠每个15名病人，这是典型工作量的两倍或三倍。达斯女士说：“我们不断获取代码，而患者正在死亡。”她说，患者人数迅速超过了可用的呼吸支持机，迫使医生和护士迅速采取分摊护理措施。</p><p> “We didn’t have enough ventilators,” Ms. Dass said. “I remember doing C.P.R. and cracking ribs. These were people from our community — it was so painful.”</p><p> 达斯女士说：“我们没有足够的呼吸机。” “我记得在做C.P.R.和肋骨开裂。这些是我们社区的人-太痛苦了。”</p><p>  Ms. Dass wrestled with sleeplessness and irritability, sniping at her husband and children. Visions of the dead, strewn across emergency room cots by the dozens, swam through her head at odd hours of the night. Medical TV dramas like Grey’s Anatomy, full of the triggering sounds of codes and beeping machines, became unbearable to watch. She couldn’t erase the memory of the neat row of three refrigerated trailers in her hospital parking lot, each packed with bodies that the morgue was too full to take.</p><p>  达斯女士因失眠和烦躁不安而摔跤，对着她的丈夫和孩子之以鼻。数十人散布在急诊室婴儿床上的死者异象，在夜晚的几个小时时游过她的头。像Grey的Anatomy这样的医疗电视剧，充满了代码和蜂鸣器的触发声音，变得难以忍受。她无法抹去医院停车场中整齐的三排冷藏拖车的记忆，每辆拖车都装满了太平间无法容纳的尸体。</p><p> One morning, after a night shift, Ms. Dass climbed into her red Mini Cooper to start her 20-minute drive home. Her car chugged onto its familiar route; a song from the 2017 film “The Greatest Showman” trickled out. For the first time since the pandemic began, Ms. Dass broke down and began to cry. She called her husband, who was on his way to work; he didn’t pick up. Finally, she reached her best friend.</p><p> 一个夜班结束后的一个早晨，达斯女士爬上了红色的迷你库珀，开始了20分钟的车程。她的车驶向熟悉的路线。 2017年电影《最伟大的表演者》中的一首歌流了出来。自大流行开始以来，达斯女士第一次崩溃并开始哭泣。她打电话给正在上班的丈夫。他没有接。最后，她认识了她最好的朋友。</p><p> “I told her, ‘These people are not going to make it, these people are not going to survive this,’” she said. “We’re there to save a person, save a life, stabilize a person so they can get further management. And here I am, not able to do that.”</p><p>她说：“我告诉她，‘这些人不会成功，这些人将无法生存。” “我们在那里是为了拯救一个人，挽救一条生命，稳定一个人，以便他们得到进一步的管理。我在这里，无法做到这一点。”</p><p> Shortly after, she phoned a longtime friend, Andi Lyn Kornfeld, a psychotherapist who said Ms. Dass was in the throes of “absolute and utter acute PTSD.”</p><p> 不久之后，她给一位长期的朋友打电话给心理治疗师安迪·林·科恩费尔德（Andi Lyn Kornfeld），她说达斯女士正处于“绝对且完全急性的创伤后应激障碍”的痛苦之中。</p><p> “I have known Shikha for 13 years,” Ms. Kornfeld said. “She is one of the strongest women I have ever met. And I had never heard her like this.”</p><p> “我认识Shikha已有13年了，” Kornfeld女士说。 “她是我见过的最坚强的女人之一。而且我从没听过她这样的话。”</p><p>  Long gone are the raucous nightly cheers, loud applause and clanging that bounced off buildings and hospital windows in the United States and abroad — the sounds of public appreciation at 7 each night for those on the pandemic’s front line.</p><p>  喧嚣的夜间欢呼声，热烈的掌声和叮当声在美国和国外的建筑物和医院的窗户上回荡，大流行前线的人们每天晚上7点听到公众的赞赏。</p><p> “Nobody’s clapping anymore,” said Dr. Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis. “They’re over it.”</p><p> “没有人鼓掌了，”圣路易斯华盛顿大学的精神病医生杰西卡·戈德（Jessica Gold）博士说。 “他们过去了。”</p><p> Health workers, once a central part of the coronavirus conversation, have in many ways faded into the background. Some, like Dr. Gilman, in Arizona, have had their salaries slashed as hospitals weigh how to cover costs.</p><p> 曾经是冠状病毒对话的核心部分的卫生工作者已经在许多方面逐渐淡出人们的视线。像亚利桑那州的吉尔曼博士这样的人，由于医院正在考虑如何负担费用，因此削减了他们的薪水。</p><p> Many have guiltily recoiled from the “hero” label emblazoned in commercials or ad campaigns, burdened by the death march of the people they could not save and the indiscriminate path of the coronavirus.</p><p> 许多人因无法挽救的人的死亡行径和冠状病毒的滥杀滥伤而从广告或广告活动中贴上的“英雄”标签上感到内rec。</p><p> The word “hero” evokes bravery and superhuman strength but leaves little room for empathy, said Dr. Nicole Washington, a psychiatrist in Oklahoma. When portrayed as stalwart saviors, health workers “don’t have the room or right to be vulnerable.”</p><p>俄克拉荷马州的精神病医生尼科尔·华盛顿博士说，“英雄”一词唤起了勇敢和超人的力量，但几乎没有移情的余地。被描绘成坚定的救世主时，卫生工作者“没有容忍弱势的空间或权利。”</p><p>  Dr. Tapia, the Colorado geriatrician, began taking an antidepressant in September after months of feeling “everything from angry to anxious to furious to just numb and hopeless.” The medication has improved her outlook. But she also worries that these decisions could jeopardize future employment.</p><p>  塔皮亚博士，科罗拉多老年病学，开始服用九月抗抑郁药的感觉个月后，“一切从生气着急大怒，只是麻木和绝望。”药物改善了她的视力。但她也担心这些决定可能会危害未来的就业。</p><p> Many state medical boards still ask intrusive questions about physicians’ history of mental health diagnoses or treatments in applications to renew a license —  a disincentive to many doctors who might otherwise seek professional help.</p><p> 许多州医疗委员会仍在询问医生的精神健康诊断或治疗历史，以申请续签许可证，这对许多本来可能寻求专业帮助的医生是不利的。</p><p>  Being on the front lines doesn’t make health workers stronger or safer than anyone else. “I’m not trying to be a hero. I don’t want to be a hero,” Dr. Gilman said. “I want to be alive.”</p><p>  站在前线并不能使卫生工作者比其他任何人都更强大或更安全。 “我并不想成为英雄。我不想成为英雄，”吉尔曼博士说。 “我想活着。”</p><p> As social bubbles balloon nationwide in advance of the chilly holiday months, health care workers fret on the edges of their communities, worried they are the carriers of contagion.</p><p> 在寒冷的假期开始之前，社会泡沫在全国范围内迅速膨胀，医护人员在社区边缘担忧，担心他们是传染病的传播者。</p><p> Dr. Marshall Fleurant, an internal medicine physician at Emory University, has the sense that his young children, 3 and 4 years old, have grown oddly accustomed to the ritual of his disrobing out of work clothes, from his scrubs to his sneakers, before entering his home.</p><p> 埃默里大学的内科医师Marshall Fleurant博士认为，他的3岁和4岁的孩子已经习惯了从洗衣服到运动鞋穿衣服的习惯。进入他的家。</p><p> “I do not touch or speak to my children before I have taken a shower,” Dr. Fleurant said. “This is just how it is. You do not touch Daddy when he walks in the door.”</p><p> 弗勒兰特博士说：“我在洗完澡之前没有抚摸孩子，也没跟孩子说话。 “这就是事实。当他走进门时，您不要碰爸爸。”</p><p> A week of vacation with his family startled him, when he could scoop the little ones up in his arms without fear. “I think they must have thought that was weird,” he said.</p><p>与家人休假一周令他大吃一惊，那时他可以毫不恐惧地将小孩子抱在怀里。他说：“我认为他们一定认为这很奇怪。”</p><p>  Trapped in a holding pattern as the coronavirus continues to burn across the nation, doctors and nurses have been taking stock of the damage done so far, and trying to sketch out the horizon beyond. On the nation’s current trajectory, they say, the forecast is bleak.</p><p>  随着冠状病毒继续在全国范围内燃烧，人们被困在一个固定的模式中，医生和护士们一直在评估迄今为止所造成的损害，并试图勾勒出更广阔的前景。他们说，就该国目前的轨迹而言，这一预测是黯淡的。</p><p> Jina Saltzman, a physician assistant in Chicago, said she was growing increasingly disillusioned with the nation’s lax approach to penning in the virus.</p><p> 芝加哥的医师助理吉娜·萨尔茨曼（Jina Saltzman）说，她对美国对这种病毒的松懈方法越来越失望。</p><p> While Illinois rapidly reimposed restrictions on restaurants and businesses when cases began to rise, Indiana, where Ms. Saltzman lives, was slower to respond. In mid-November, she was astounded to see crowds of unmasked people in a restaurant as she picked up a pizza. “It’s so disheartening. We’re coming here to work every day to keep the public safe,” she said. “But the public isn’t trying to keep the public safe.”</p><p> 当案件开始上升时，伊利诺伊州迅速对餐馆和企业实行限制，但萨尔茨曼女士居住的印第安纳州的回应却较慢。 11月中旬，当她拿起披萨时，在一家餐馆看到成群的不露面的人感到惊讶。 “这真令人沮丧。我们每天都会来这里工作，以确保公众安全。”她说。 “但是公众并没有试图确保公众安全。”</p><p> Since the spring, Dr. Gilman has watched three co-workers and a cousin die from the virus. Ms. Dass lost a close family friend, who spent three weeks at Mount Sinai Queen’s under her care. When Dr. Fleurant’s aunt died of Covid, “We never got to bury her, never got to pay respects. It was a crushing loss.”</p><p> 从春季开始，吉尔曼博士就目睹了三名同事和一位堂兄死于该病毒。达斯女士失去了一位亲密的家人朋友，在她的照顾下，他在西奈山皇后医院度过了三个星期。当Fleurant博士的姨妈死于Covid时，“我们永远不会埋葬她，永远也不必致敬。这真是惨重的损失。”</p><p> In state after state, people continue to flood hospital wards, where hallways often provide makeshift beds for the overflow. More than 12 million cases have been recorded since the pandemic took hold in the United States, with the pace of infection accelerating in the last couple months.</p><p> 在一个又一个的州中，人们继续淹没医院的病房，那里的走廊经常为临时病房提供临时病床。自从美国大流行以来，已经记录了超过1200万例病例，在过去几个月中，感染的速度在加快。</p><p> Jill Naiberk, a nurse at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, has spent more of 2020 in full protective gear than out of it. About twice a day, when Ms. Naiberk needs a sip of water, she must completely de-gown, then suit up again.</p><p> 内布拉斯加州大学医学中心的护士吉尔·奈伯克（Jill Naiberk）在2020年花费了全部的防护装备而不是全部。每天约两次，当Naiberk女士需要喝水时，她必须完全脱去长袍，然后重新穿上衣服。</p><p> Otherwise, “you’re hot and sweaty and stinky,” she said. “It’s not uncommon to come out of rooms with sweat running down your face, and you need to change your mask because it’s wet.”</p><p>否则，“你又热又汗又臭。”她说。 “带着汗水从房间出来流到房间外面并不少见，而且因为潮湿，您需要更换口罩。”</p><p> It’s her ninth straight month of Covid duty. “My unit is 16 beds. Rarely do we have an open one,” she said. “And when we do have an open bed, it’s usually because somebody has passed away.”</p><p> 这是她连续第九个月担任Covid职务。 “我的房间有16张床。她说：“我们很少公开。” “而且当我们有一张敞开的床时，通常是因为有人去世了。”</p><p> Many of her I.C.U. patients are young, in their 40s or 50s. “They’re looking at us and saying things like, ‘Don’t let me die’ and ‘I guess I should have worn that mask,’” she said.</p><p> 她的许多I.C.U.患者年龄在40多岁或50多岁。她说：“他们看着我们，说的是'不要让我死'和'我想我应该戴那个面具'。”</p><p> Sometimes she cries on her way home, where she lives alone with her two dogs. Her 79-year-old mother resides just a couple houses away.</p><p> 有时，她在回家的路上哭泣，独自一人与两只狗住在一起。她79岁的母亲仅住在几所房子之外。</p><p>  “I keep telling everybody the minute I can safely hug you again, get ready,” she said. “Because I’m never letting go.”</p><p>  她说：“我会告诉所有人我可以再次安全地拥抱你的时刻，准备好。” “因为我永不放手。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/health/doctors-nurses-covid-stress.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/health/doctors-nurses-covid-stress.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/医生/">#医生</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nurses/">#nurses</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/博士/">#博士</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
