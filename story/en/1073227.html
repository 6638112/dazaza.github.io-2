The message I was aiming for was something like &#34;If you have the mental focus and self-discipline to be successful in the dominant society, but you don&#39;t like it, here&#39;s how you can change your value system to reduce your need for money and status, and gain some benefits of industrial civilization without being in a position of forced obedience.&#34; Or: &#34;Society is your enemy, it attacks you by making you need money, and if you are better than the average person at sacrificing comfort for long-term goals, you can work toward a position where you need relatively little money and have more free time.&#34;  Instead, through great carelessness, I allowed people to think my message was something like &#34;If you can&#39;t even get good grades or hold down a job, don&#39;t worry, there is a gateway to a magical wonderland in the nearest dumpster.&#34; Or: &#34;If you have a weak sense of who you are and you need an inspiring story to give your life meaning, how about being a heroic puritan like me, whose goal is to avoid guilt through an impossible lifestyle that has no connection to a society that is viewed as a cartoonish monolithic evil.&#34;  Over the years a lot of readers have been disappointed that I&#39;m not that guy, and at least a few have quit classes and jobs that they should have stayed with. Even I sometimes lost focus on what I really needed. I dabbled in homesteading and discovered that it requires too much work and way too much driving, while the excitement of living in the woods fades quickly. Looking back on the popular myth that first attracted me to primitive living, what I wanted out there was something that is easier to find in the city (but still difficult): close to zero obligations, and giant blocks of time with nothing I&#39;m supposed to be doing. I&#39;m still working on that.   &#34;How To Drop Out&#34; has been my most popular piece of writing for more than four years. In that time I&#39;ve bought some land, which you can read about on my  landblog, and I&#39;ve shifted my main residence to Spokane, where it&#39;s harder to find good food in dumpsters, so my expenses are higher. Also, I&#39;ve decided I need to be even more aggressive in dispelling the very powerful myths that are tied to the idea of dropping out of society. So here&#39;s a new short version of the essay, hitting the main points, adding a few new points, and really hammering the points that people keep missing. The original essay is below it.   1. Do not drop out. Instead, try to stop yourself from committing suicide until you can find a job that is so non-hellish that it does not make you suicidal, and then stay at that job, or an even better one if you can find it, for several decades. Grab what fun you can on the weekends, save up money, enjoy your retirement, and you will have lived a pretty good life.  Seriously, it&#39;s good to live differently, to take uncommon paths, to minimize your dependence on a society gone astray. But if I were to say, &#34;Woo-hoo! Dropping out is so cool! Quit your job now and hop a freight train to Bolivia, and you will be ALIVE while everyone else is DEAD,&#34; then that might be worse than saying nothing. Motivational writing is a drug. If you require a motivational writer or speaker to live differently, then as soon as that external energy shot wears off, you will fizzle and burn out. But if everyone is trying to discourage you from doing something, and you do it anyway,  then you have the internal motivation to persist and succeed. So: dropping out is not fun -- better not do it.   2. &#34;Drop out&#34; is a bad metaphor, because it implies you are either in or out. In reality,  no one has ever been in or out -- everyone is somewhere in between. The most pathetic office drone still has forbidden dreams, and the most extreme mountain man still has commerce with society. Your mission is to find a niche, somewhere in this range, where you&#39;re not held over a barrel by a system that gives you no participation in power.   3. It&#39;s not about being pure. It&#39;s not about keeping your hands clean or avoiding guilt. Imagine birds living in a forest. Humans come and cut the forest down and build barns and plant crops. If some birds are able to live in the barns, or eat the crops, they don&#39;t say, &#34;I&#39;m not going to live in the barn -- that&#39;s cheating,&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m not going to eat the crops, because then I&#39;m just part of the system.&#34; Of all the species on Earth, only humans are that stupid.  Now, that doesn&#39;t mean you should accept all gifts. Sometimes the &#34;crops&#34; are poisoned or the &#34;barns&#34; are traps. By all means, when you are offered benefits, use your full intelligence to see what strings are attached. And if you reject something, reject it because you see that it will do you more harm than good, not because you have some silly obsession with purity. Here&#39;s a test: when Thoreau was living at Walden Pond, he would often go into town for dinners with his family. If you see anything wrong with that, read this section again, or read this piece about the  myth of self-sufficiency.   4. &#34;Out&#34; is relative and not absolute. It is a path and not a destination. And you walk the path not by disconnecting from the rest of the world, but by engaging it in an intelligent and creative way, instead of in one of the disempowering ways that are made to look like the only ways. The myth of the pure and total outsider is one of those disempowering ways. It&#39;s a trick designed to make you set an impossible goal, get discouraged, and give up.   5. Do not try to find a job doing what you love. This is my most radical advice. There are some people in the world who have jobs they love so much that they would do them for free. If you become one of these people, you will probably get there not through planning but through luck, by doing what you love for free until somehow the money starts coming in. But if you make an effort to combine your income and your love, you are likely to end up compromising both, making a poverty income by doing something you don&#39;t quite love, or no longer love. For example, if you decide to become a chef because you love cooking, it will probably make you hate cooking, because cooking will become linked in your mind to all the bullshit around the job.  What I recommend instead is to separate your money from your love. Get the most low-stress source of income that you can find, and then do exactly what you love for free. It might eventually make you money or it might not. &#34;Do what you love and the money will follow&#34; is mostly false. The real rule is: &#34;If you&#39;re doing what you love, you won&#39;t care if you never make any money from it -- but you still need money.&#34;   6. When you begin to get free, you will get depressed. It works like this: When you were three years old, if your parents weren&#39;t too bad, you knew how to play spontaneously. Then you had to go to school, where everything you did was required. The worst thing is that even the fun activities, like singing songs and playing games, were commanded under threat of punishment. So even play got tied up in your mind with a control structure, and severed from the life inside you. If you were &#34;rebellious&#34;, you preserved the life inside you by connecting it to forbidden activities, which are usually forbidden for good reasons, and when your rebellion ended in suffering and failure, you figured the life inside you was not to be trusted. If you were &#34;obedient&#34;, you simply crushed the life inside you almost to death.  Freedom means you&#39;re not punished for saying no. The most fundamental freedom is the freedom to do nothing. But when you get this freedom, after many years of activities that were forced, nothing is all you want to do. You might start projects that seem like the kind of thing you&#39;re supposed to love doing, music or writing or art, and not finish because nobody is forcing you to finish and it&#39;s not really what you want to do. It could take months, if you&#39;re lucky, or more likely years, before you can build up the life inside you to an intensity where it can drive projects that you actually enjoy and finish, and then it will take more time before you build up enough skill that other people recognize your actions as valuable.   7. Hard work is satanic. Primitive humans have moments of extreme exertion, but they don&#39;t go through life in a hurry, they don&#39;t push themselves, and even when they live on the edge of hunger, they don&#39;t stress about it. Even medieval serfs worked fewer hours, and at a slower pace, than modern industrialized workers. Ivan Illich has written that at the dawn of the industrial age, they would put a man in a pit that gradually filled with water, and give him a pump, and he would have to pump constantly all day to not drown. Humans are so naturally resistant to hard work that it took something like that to train people for industrial jobs. Now they do it with the schooling system, and with the religious doctrine that hard work is morally virtuous.  The opposite of hard work is quality work. Quality work may be done quickly, but it is never pushed. It arranges itself around the goal of doing something as well as it can be done, and it finds its own pace.  Another opposite of hard work is playful work. Like quality work it may be done quickly but is never pushed. But playful work is indifferent to quality, or even to success. When you&#39;re doing playful work, you don&#39;t care if it ends in total failure, because you&#39;re having such a good time that you would look forward to doing the whole job again.   8. There are no easy rules. This is a tangential point. If you&#39;re interested in dropping out of society, you are also likely to reject society&#39;s rules, and try to replace them with counterculture rules or rules of your own invention. Humans are map-making animals, and we&#39;re always trying to make a map so good that we no longer have to look at the land. This is a mistake, and if you reject the dominant map, it&#39;s best to learn to not use any map at all. There is one rule that&#39;s very simple, but not easy: observe reality and adjust.   9. Don&#39;t rush it. Getting free is not like walking through a magic doorway -- it&#39;s like growing a fruit tree.        I didn&#39;t even start dropping out until my mid-20&#39;s. Unlike many outsiders and &#34;radicals,&#34; I never had to go through a stage where I realized that our whole society is insane -- I&#39;ve known that as long as I can remember. But even being already mentally outside the system, I found it extremely challenging to get out physically. In fourth grade I wanted to blow up the school, but I didn&#39;t know how, and even if I had done it, it would not have meant an endless summer vacation. In high school, inspired by Bill Kaysing&#39;s  The Robin Hood Handbook, I wanted to go live off the land in the Idaho wilderness, but actually doing it seemed as remote and difficult as going to the moon. (Kaysing later wrote the book  We Never Went to the Moon.) So I continued to bide my time and obey the letter of the law, like the guy in the Kafka parable  (link). In college, when Artis the Spoonman performed on campus and told us all to drop out, I thought that was ridiculous -- how would I survive without a college degree?  A few years later, with my two college degrees, after jobs operating envelope-stuffing machinery and answering phones in a warehouse, I was finally nudged toward dropping out by the Bush I recession and my own nature -- that I&#39;m extremely frugal, love unstructured time, and would sooner eat garbage than feign enthusiasm. More than ten years later I&#39;m a specialist at eating garbage -- as I draft this I&#39;m eating a meal I made with organic eggs from a dumpster, and later I&#39;ll make a pie of dumpstered apples. I live on under $2000 a year, I have no permanent residence, and moving to the Idaho wilderness now seems like a reachable goal -- but no longer the best idea.  Getting free of the system is more complex than we&#39;ve been led to believe. Here as in so many places, our thinking has been warped by all-or-nothingism, by the Hollywood myth of the sudden overwhelming victory: Quit your corporate job this minute, sell all your possessions, and hop a freight train to a straw bale house in the mountains where you&#39;ll grow all your own food and run with the wolves! In reality, between the extremes there&#39;s a whole dropout universe, and no need to hurry.  In my case, as I understood what I had to go through to make money, I stopped spending it. I learned to make my meals from scratch, and then from cheaper scratch, making my own sourdough bread and tortillas. I stopped buying music and books (exceptions in exceptional cases) and got in the habit of using the library. When I crashed my car, I kept the insurance money and walked, and then got an old road bike. I took a road trip by hitchhiking, but it was too physically taxing and I got sick. Like many novice radicals, I got puritanical and pushed myself too hard, and finally eased off. I temporarily owned another car and lived in it for a couple months of a long road trip. In the Clinton economic bubble, I got a job that was much easier and better paying than my previous jobs, and built up savings that I&#39;m still living on.  The main thing I was doing during those years was de-institutionalizing myself, learning to navigate the hours of the day and the thoughts in my head with no teacher or boss telling me what to do. I had to learn to relax without getting lethargic, to never put off washing the dishes, to balance the needs of the present and the future, to have spontaneous fun but avoid addiction, to be intuitive, to notice other people, to make big and small decisions. I went through mild depression and severe fatigue and embarrassing obsessions and strange diets and simplistic new age thinking. It&#39;s a long and ugly road, and most of us have to walk it, or something like it, to begin to be free.  A friend says, &#34;This world makes it easy to toe the line, and easy to totally fuck up, and really hard to not do either one.&#34; But this hard skill, not quitting your job or moving to the woods or reducing consumption or doing art all day, is the essence of dropping out. When people rush it, and try to take shortcuts, they slide into addiction or debt or depression or shattered utopian communities, and then go back to toeing the line.  The path is different for everyone. Maybe you&#39;re already intuitive and decisive and know how to have fun, but you don&#39;t know how to manage money or stay grounded. Maybe you&#39;re using wealth or position or charm to keep from having to relate to people as equals, or you&#39;re keeping constantly busy to avoid facing something lurking in the stillness. Whatever weaknesses keep you dependent on the system, you have to take care of them before you break away from the system, just as you have to learn to swim before you escape a ship. How? By going out and back, a little farther each time, with persistence and patience, until you reach the skill and distance that feels right.  At the moment there&#39;s no reason to drop out &#34;all the way&#34; except puritanism. I hate civilization as much as anyone, but in these last few years before it crashes, we should appreciate and use what it offers. Sylvan Hart (his given name!), the 20th century mountain man who even smelted his own metal, still traded with civilization, and once carried a sheet of glass 50 miles through the woods so he could have a good window. (See Harold Peterson,  The Last of the Mountain Men)  Some of the happiest people I know have dropped out only a short distance. They still live in the city and have jobs and pay rent, but they&#39;ve done something more mentally difficult -- and mentally liberating -- than moving to some isolated farm. They have become permanently content with low-status, modest-paying jobs that they don&#39;t have to think about at home or even half the time when they&#39;re at work. Yes, these jobs are getting scarce, but they&#39;re still a thousand times more plentiful than the kind of job that miserable people cannot give up longing for -- where you make a living doing something so personally meaningful that you would do it for free.  &#34;Do what you love and the money will follow&#34; is an irresponsible lie, a denial of the deep opposition between money and love. The real rule is: &#34;If you&#39;re doing what you love, you won&#39;t care if you never make a cent from it, because that&#39;s what love means -- but you still need money!&#34; So what I recommend, as the second element of dropping out, is coldly severing your love from your income. One part of your life is to make only as much money as you need, at a job that you can come home from feeling energized and not drained. And then the important part of your life is to do just exactly what you love, with zero pressure to make money. And if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll eventually make money anyway.  But how much money do you &#34;need&#34;? And what if the only jobs available are low-paying and so exhausting that you come home and collapse into bed? These questions lead to my own level of dropping out, which is to reduce expenses to the point that you shift your whole identity from the high-budget to the low-budget universe.  In a temperate climate, you have only five physical needs: food, water, clothing, shelter, and fuel. (If you&#39;re a raw-foodist and don&#39;t mind the cold, you don&#39;t even need fuel!) Everything else that costs money is a luxury or a manufactured need. Manufactured needs have fancy names: entertainment, transportation, education, employment, housing, &#34;health care.&#34; In every case these are creations of, and enablers of, an alienating and dominating system, a world of lost wholeness.  If you love your normal activities, you don&#39;t need to tack on &#34;entertainment.&#34; If you aren&#39;t forced to travel many miles a day, you don&#39;t need &#34;transportation.&#34; If you are permitted to learn on your own, you don&#39;t need &#34;education.&#34; If you can meet all your physical needs through the direct action of yourself and your friends, you don&#39;t need to go do someone else&#39;s work all day. If you&#39;re permitted to merely occupy physical space and build something to keep the wind and rain out, you don&#39;t need to pay someone to &#34;provide&#34; it. Expensive health care is especially insidious: not only is our toxic and stressful society the primary cause of sickness, but the enormous expenses that have been added in the last hundred years are mostly profit-making scams that cause and prolong sickness far more than they heal it.  This is the low-budget universe: I ride around the city on an old cheap road bike, in street clothes, often hauling food I&#39;ve just pulled out of a dumpster. Sometimes I&#39;ll be on a trail where I&#39;ll invariably be passed by people on thousand dollar bikes in racing outfits. Why are they riding around if they&#39;re not carrying anything? And why are they in such a hurry?  I used to be envious of those suckers: I  haveto ride my bike to survive and they&#39;re so rich they do it for fun. But what is this &#34;fun&#34;? I get everything -- exercise, getting from place to place, meaningfulness, the feeling of autonomy, and doing what&#39;s necessary to survive -- all with the same activity: riding my bike. They should be envious of me: my life is elegant and theirs is disjointed and self-defeating, </p><p>2004年最早的《如何退学》很容易成为我最受欢迎的作品&#39；我写过，成千上万的人通过把&#34；如何退出社会&#34；进入谷歌，但我想知道这是否值得。我想要传达的信息是&#34；如果你有在主导社会取得成功的精神专注和自律，但你没有&#39；我不喜欢这里&#39；这就是如何改变你的价值体系，减少你对金钱和地位的需求，并从工业文明中获得一些好处，而不是被迫服从&#34;

 多年来，很多读者对我&#39；I’我不是那个人，至少有一些人已经放弃了本该留在学校的课程和工作。就连我有时也无法专注于我真正需要的东西。我涉猎过宅基地，发现它需要太多的工作和太多的驾驶，而住在树林里的兴奋感很快就消失了。回顾最早吸引我去原始生活的流行神话，我想要的是在城市里更容易找到的东西（但仍然很难找到）：接近零的义务，巨大的时间块，没有我&#39；我应该在做什么。我&#39；我还在努力&#34;如何辍学&#34；这是我四年多来最受欢迎的作品。那时候我&#39；我买了一些土地，你可以在我的土地博客上看到，我&#39；我把我的主要住所搬到了斯波坎，在那里&#39；在垃圾箱里很难找到好的食物，所以我的花费更高。还有，我&#39；我已经决定，我需要更加积极地消除与退出社会的想法有关的非常强大的神话。所以这里&#39；这是这篇文章的一个新的简短版本，抓住了要点，增加了一些新的观点，并且真正地强调了人们一直忽略的要点。原文在下面。1.不要退学。相反，试着阻止自己自杀，直到你能找到一份非地狱般的工作，它不会让你自杀，然后继续做那份工作，或者如果你能找到一份更好的工作，几十年。在周末尽你所能地享受乐趣，攒钱，享受退休生活，你就会过上很好的生活。说真的，它&#39；It’改变生活，走不寻常的道路，尽量减少对误入歧途的社会的依赖是件好事。但如果我说&#34；呜呜！辍学太酷了！现在辞去工作，跳上货运火车去玻利维亚，其他人都死了的时候，你还活着，&#34；那可能比什么都不说更糟糕。动机写作是一种药物。如果你需要一位励志作家或演讲者以不同的方式生活，那么一旦外部能量消失，你就会失败并精疲力竭。但是，如果每个人都试图阻止你做某事，而你无论如何都这么做了，那么你就有了坚持和成功的内在动力。所以：辍学并不有趣——最好不要这样做。2. &#34;退学&#34；这是一个糟糕的比喻，因为它意味着你要么进去要么出去。事实上，从来没有人进出过——每个人都在两者之间。最可悲的办公室无人机仍然有着被禁止的梦想，最极端的山地人仍然与社会有着商业往来。你的任务是找到一个利基，在这个范围内的某个地方，你&#39；你不会被一个不让你参与权力的制度束缚。3.它&#39；这与纯洁无关。它&#39；这与保持双手清洁或避免内疚无关。想象一下，鸟儿生活在森林里。人类来砍伐森林，建造谷仓，种植农作物。如果有些鸟能在谷仓里生活，或吃庄稼，它们就不能&#39；不要说，&#34；我&#39；我不打算住在谷仓里——那&#39；她作弊了&#34；或&#34；我&#39；我不会吃庄稼，因为那样我&#39；我只是系统的一部分&#34; 在地球上所有的物种中，只有人类如此愚蠢。现在，这并不意味着&#39；不是说你应该接受所有的礼物。有时&#34；农作物#34；中毒或&#34；谷仓&#34；都是陷阱。无论如何，当你获得福利时，要充分利用你的智慧，看看附加了什么条件。如果你拒绝某事，拒绝它是因为你看到它对你弊大于利，而不是因为你痴迷于纯洁。这里&#39；这是一个考验：梭罗住在瓦尔登湖的时候，他经常和家人进城吃饭。如果你觉得有什么不对劲，请再读一遍这一节，或者读一读这篇关于自给自足神话的文章。4. &#34;出局&#34；是相对的，而不是绝对的。这是一条路，而不是目的地。你走这条路，不是通过与世界其他地方隔绝，而是通过以一种智慧和创造性的方式参与进来，而不是以一种被认为是唯一的方式的削弱力量的方式。纯粹而彻底的局外人的神话就是其中之一。它&#39；这是一个旨在让你设定一个不可能的目标，感到沮丧，然后放弃的伎俩。5.不要试图找一份你喜欢的工作。这是我最激进的建议。世界上有一些人拥有他们非常热爱的工作，他们愿意免费做这些工作。如果你成为这些人中的一员，你很可能不是通过计划，而是通过运气，通过免费做你喜欢的事情，直到钱开始流入。但是如果你努力把你的收入和你的爱结合起来，你很可能最终会两者都妥协，通过做一些你不做的事情来获得贫困收入&#39；不完全爱，或者不再爱。例如，如果你决定成为一名厨师是因为你热爱烹饪，这可能会让你讨厌烹饪，因为烹饪在你的脑海中会与工作中的所有废话联系在一起。我建议你把钱和爱情分开。获得你能找到的压力最小的收入来源，然后免费做你喜欢做的事。它可能最终会让你赚钱，也可能不会&#34;做你喜欢的事，钱就会随之而来；这基本上是错误的。真正的规则是：&#34；如果你&#39；如果你做你喜欢的事，你就赢了&#39；I don’我不在乎你是否从未从中赚钱，但你仍然需要钱&#34;   6.当你开始获得自由时，你会感到沮丧。它的工作原理是这样的：当你三岁时，如果你的父母不是&#39；太糟糕了，你知道如何自发地演奏。然后你必须去学校，在那里你所做的一切都是必须的。最糟糕的是，即使是唱歌、玩游戏等有趣的活动，也受到了惩罚的威胁。所以，即使是游戏也会被一种控制结构束缚在你的头脑中，与你内心的生活割裂开来。如果你是&#34；叛逆的&#34；，你将自己的生命与被禁止的活动联系起来，从而保护了自己的生命，而这些活动通常是出于正当理由而被禁止的。当你的反抗以痛苦和失败告终时，你认为自己的生命是不可信任的。如果你是&#34；顺从的&#34；，你只是把你内心的生命碾碎得几乎要死。自由意味着你&#39；我们不会因为说不而受到惩罚。最基本的自由是什么都不做的自由。但当你获得这种自由，在多年被迫从事的活动之后，你什么都不想做。你可能会开始一些你喜欢的项目&#39；你应该热爱工作、音乐、写作或艺术，而不去完成，因为没有人强迫你去完成它；这不是你真正想做的。如果你&#39；你很幸运，或者更可能是几年后，你才能把你内心的生活建立到一种强度，从而推动你真正喜欢并完成的项目，然后你需要更多的时间才能建立足够的技能，让其他人认识到你的行动是有价值的。7.努力工作是邪恶的。原始人类有极度劳累的时刻，但他们没有&#39；不要匆匆忙忙地度过一生，他们不会&#39；不要强迫自己，即使他们生活在饥饿的边缘，他们也不会&#39；不要为此感到压力。就连中世纪的农奴也比现代工业化工人工作的时间少，速度慢。伊万·伊利奇（Ivan Illich）曾写道，在工业时代的黎明，他们会把一个人放在一个逐渐充满水的坑里，给他一个水泵，他必须整天不停地抽水，以免溺水。人类天生就抗拒艰苦的工作，因此需要这样的东西来训练人们从事工业工作。现在，他们通过学校教育体系，以及努力工作在道德上是高尚的宗教教义来实现这一目标。努力工作的反面是高质量的工作。高质量的工作可能会很快完成，但永远不会被推动。它围绕着尽可能做好某件事的目标来安排自己，并找到自己的节奏。努力工作的另一个反面是好玩的工作。就像高质量的工作一样，它可以很快完成，但永远不会被推动。但有趣的工作与质量无关，甚至与成功无关。当你&#39；你在做好玩的工作，你不&#39；我不在乎它是否以彻底失败告终，因为你&#39；We’我们玩得很开心，你会期待着再次完成这项工作的。8.没有简单的规则。这是一个切点。如果你&#39；如果你对退出社会感兴趣，你也可能会拒绝社会#39；尝试用反文化规则或你自己发明的规则来代替它们。人类是绘制地图的动物，而我们&#3</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/退学/">#退学</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/drop/">#drop</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
