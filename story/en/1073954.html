His victory was guaranteed; there were a mere twenty voters and they had all been either bribed or intimidated to ensure the correct result. However, he  did want to show that he had his finger on the pulse of the town, albeit  one that he would never visit again unless there was another election. He asked around and was given this advice; talk about  fish. All he had to do was pretend to like the Cornish pilchard and that would be enough; he did not, of course, have to eat one.</p><p>1802年7月，内阁部长威廉·温德姆在康沃尔郡腐烂的圣马维斯区参加选举。他的胜利是有保证的；当时只有20名选民，他们要么受到贿赂，要么受到恐吓，以确保选举结果正确。然而，他确实想表明，他对这个城市的脉搏了如指掌，尽管除非再次举行选举，否则他将永远不会再次造访。他四处打听，得到了这个建议；谈谈鱼。他所要做的就是假装喜欢康沃尔沙丁鱼，这就足够了；当然，他不必吃。</p><p>  This was good advice; Tory cabinet ministers did not eat pilchards, but they would have smelt them in summer if they lived on the south coast of Cornwall. They were particularly oily and malodorous fish; they were captured in prodigious numbers and would all arrive at St Mawes or St Ives or Polperro at the same time, and, despite moving them quickly to a remote building to process them, they would stink the town out at the height of the harvest.  It was not the smell of the fish themselves, for they were gutted and salted and preserved very quickly. It was the oil that came from them that stank.</p><p>这是很好的建议；保守党内阁大臣不吃沙丁鱼，但如果他们住在康沃尔的南海岸，他们会在夏天闻到沙丁鱼的味道。它们是特别油腻和有臭味的鱼；他们被抓获的数量惊人，会同时到达圣马维斯、圣艾夫斯或波尔佩罗，尽管他们很快被转移到一个偏远的建筑进行处理，但在收获的高峰期，他们会让小镇臭烘烘。这不是鱼本身的味道，因为它们很快被掏空、腌制和保存。正是他们身上的油发臭。</p><p> The pilchard shoals arrived in July and could still be caught in November, weather permitting. The locals would be on the lookout from the end of July, which was the time of the 1802 election and perhaps why it was on the minds of Tory campaign headquarters.  Boats with drift nets called  seins would be waiting in the water, for when the fish did arrive, it was a  chase.</p><p>皮尔查德浅滩于7月抵达，如果天气允许，仍有可能在11月捕获。从7月底开始，当地人就一直在观望，当时正是1802年大选的时候，这或许也是为什么保守党竞选总部会想到这一点。带着称为塞恩的漂网的船只会在水中等待，因为当鱼真的到达时，那是一场追逐。</p><p> Lookouts called  huers would wait on prominent high positions such as St Michaels Mount.  Huers were skilled people, paid up to a guinea a week to be able to recognise a pilchard shoal from the tell tale signs- a  moving purple-brown-red oily looking patch darkening the sea near the surface, followed by interested sea birds. When spotted, they blew their four foot trumpet or passed the information via a set of semaphores and flags. They were also paid to avoid any distractions and to know what the fish would do next.</p><p>被称为huers的了望员会在圣米歇尔山等显眼的高处站岗。休尔人是技术娴熟的人，每周的工资高达一几内亚，以便能够从指示牌上识别出一个沙丁鱼浅滩——一个移动的紫棕红色油色斑点，使海面附近的海水变暗，随后是感兴趣的海鸟。当被发现时，他们会吹响四英尺高的喇叭，或者通过一组信号灯和旗帜传递信息。他们还得到报酬，以避免任何干扰，并知道鱼下一步会做什么。</p><p> Pilchard harvesting was a skilled community endeavour; starting with the huers, then the fisherman who skilfully captured large amounts of fish in their drift nets, brought them on to shore, where the fish were loaded in wheelbarrows to ‘pilchard palaces’, then gutted ( ‘garbaged’, as contemporary accounts say), salted, barrelled into hogsheads of up to 6000 fish, and then pressed. This preserved the fish and pressing produced fish oil that could be used for oil lamps, which was often valuable enough to pay the costs of catching them.</p><p>沙丁鱼的收获是一项熟练的社区活动；从休尔人开始，然后是渔夫，他们熟练地用流网捕获了大量的鱼，把它们带到岸边，用手推车把鱼运到“沙丁鱼宫殿”，然后去内脏（当代的说法是“垃圾”），腌制，装进多达6000条鱼的大桶中，然后压榨。这保存了鱼，并产生了可用于油灯的鱼油，其价值往往足以支付捕获它们的费用。</p><p> It was vital work for the poor and welcome profits for the rich. Perhaps Windham was told to reference pilchards to his twenty voters because they had a business interest in the boats, nets, barrels and processing. In exchange for their skilled work, the producers of wealth got seasonal employment and cheap food and the rich got everything else, including the right to vote.</p><p>这对穷人来说是至关重要的工作，对富人来说是值得欢迎的利润。也许温德姆被告知要把沙丁鱼推荐给他的20名选民，因为他们对船只、渔网、桶和加工有商业利益。作为他们熟练工作的交换，财富的生产者得到了季节性就业和廉价食品，富人得到了一切，包括选举权。</p><p>  That the pilchard was cheap food should not be underestimated. People’s lives and livelihoods depended on it; no pilchard shoals by mid August would lead to anxious letters in the newspapers. The Cornish folklore expression said that pilchards brought ‘food money light, all in one night’, which was also a reminder that the shoals would appear in early evening and the fishermen would have to nurse their captured food in their deep nets until the next morning.  When they did arrive, it was an event, as shown in Winston Graham’s  Poldark series. People would watch from cliff tops as the battle commenced between the skill of the fisherman and the weather and sea currents. Success brought the same joy as bringing in the harvest, for it was essentially the same thing.</p><p>不应低估沙丁鱼是廉价食品。人民的生活和生计有赖于此；到8月中旬，皮尔查德浅滩不会在报纸上引发焦虑的信件。康沃尔民间传说中的说法是，沙丁鱼带来了“一夜之间的食物金钱之光”，这也提醒人们，浅滩会在傍晚出现，渔民必须在深网中喂养捕获的食物，直到第二天早上。当他们到达时，这是一件大事，正如温斯顿·格雷厄姆（Winston Graham）的波尔达克（Poldark）系列所示。人们会在悬崖顶上观看渔夫的技能与天气和海流之间的战斗。成功带来的喜悦与收获的喜悦是一样的，因为它本质上是一样的。</p><p>  Pilchards were so abundant at times that they became free food. The poor would be waiting waist- deep in waters when the boats arrived in port, and gentlemen who had caught a lot of fish would be honour bound to give some away. When Mr H.C Blewett’s boat came in ( he wasn’t risking his own life of course, just like he did not personally dig his in his mines) he generously donated a hogshead of pilchards to the poor of Marazion – to a charity first, so they could eliminate the undeserving. He did not need thanks for all the fish, as they say, but he would have still expected it. Blewett could afford to be generous because he spent most of his time exploiting the poor in his shops, ships and mines. In 1819 an unlucky traveller advertised in the Royal Cornwall Gazette. He had lost a wallet containing to cheques for Blewett to the amount of £400.</p><p>沙丁鱼非常丰富，有时甚至成为免费食物。当船到达港口时，穷人会在齐腰深的水里等着，捕到很多鱼的绅士们会很荣幸地把一些鱼送人。当H.C.Blewett先生的船进港时（他当然没有冒着生命危险，就像他没有亲自挖掘自己的矿藏一样），他慷慨地向马拉锡安的穷人捐赠了一大桶沙丁鱼——首先捐赠给一个慈善机构，这样他们就可以消灭不配的人。他不需要像他们所说的那样感谢所有的鱼，但他还是会期待的。布莱维特可以慷慨大方，因为他大部分时间都在商店、轮船和矿井里剥削穷人。1819年，一位不幸的旅行者在皇家康沃尔公报上登了广告。他丢失了一个钱包，里面有一张400英镑的布莱维特支票。</p><p> The poor were grateful that pilchards were an export commodity, and there would be robust quality control before they were processed. Most were destined for Italy, except during the period of Napoleon’s blockade. So, the other way to get free food was to hang around the pilchard palaces and beg for  pezacs – fish with broken backs, or other fish that were too small, a little diseased, broken or nibbled by predators like the dogfish. Pilchards saved lived in England, but they save souls in catholic Italy, when pilchards were popular during lent.</p><p>穷人很感激沙丁鱼是一种出口商品，在加工之前会有严格的质量控制。除拿破仑封锁时期外，大部分都是运往意大利的。因此，获得免费食物的另一种方式是在皮尔查德宫殿附近闲逛，乞求佩扎克鱼——背部受伤的鱼，或其他太小、有点生病、受伤或被狗鱼等捕食者啃食的鱼。盗贼在英国生活，但在天主教意大利，盗贼在四旬斋期间很流行，盗贼可以拯救灵魂。</p><p> When pilchards were purchased, they were cheap; far, far cheaper than any other fish. In a glut, you could buy four for a penny and bake them into a substantial meal. They were four a penny in the streets of Cornwall said the  Hampshire Chronicle (10.09.1810). The cheapness created a stigma, and they were not eaten much outside Cornwall because of it. They were always associated with charity or poverty; like the potato, only more so. Pilchards had the salt washed off prior to market, but their saltiness was extreme, increasingly so even for Georgian tastes, and they provoked raging thirsts and exacerbated the already poor oral hygiene. Pilchards went hand-in- hand with beer drinking and mouth ulcers.</p><p>当人们购买沙丁鱼时，它们很便宜；比其他任何鱼都便宜得多。在供过于求的情况下，你可以花一分钱买四个，然后把它们烤成一顿丰盛的饭菜。据《汉普郡纪事报》（10.09.1810）报道，康沃尔大街上每便士就有四个人。这种廉价的食品造成了一种耻辱感，因此在康沃尔以外的地方，人们很少食用它们。他们总是与慈善或贫困联系在一起；就像土豆一样，更是如此。沙丁鱼在上市前就把盐洗掉了，但它们的咸度非常高，即使是佐治亚口味的沙丁鱼也越来越咸，它们会引起口渴，加剧本来就很差的口腔卫生状况。偷盗与喝啤酒和口腔溃疡密切相关。</p><p> The English poor lived on potatoes in the winter, except in Cornwall where they lived on potatoes and pilchards. They were expected to be prudent; preserving the fish in autumn when they were in a glut. The main expense for the poor was not the fish, but the expensive salt needed to preserve them, and English salt did not do a good job, despite the protestations of the North- West salt producers. So French salt was smuggled, like more interesting items like rum and tobacco, but literally more vital. Another group of even more exploited workers had pilchards on the menu- those slaves on the West Indian plantations.</p><p>英国穷人在冬天靠土豆为生，除了康沃尔郡，他们靠土豆和沙丁鱼为生。人们期望他们谨慎行事；在秋季鱼供过于求的时候保存它们。穷人的主要开支不是鱼，而是需要昂贵的盐来保存鱼，尽管西北部的盐生产商提出了抗议，英国的盐并没有起到很好的作用。所以法国盐被走私，就像朗姆酒和烟草等更有趣的东西一样，但实际上更重要。另一组更受剥削的工人菜单上有小偷——西印度种植园的奴隶。</p><p>  Pilchards were more than a modest fish; the trade represented Regency society as well- cheap food, hard work and easy profits for those who owned the means of production!</p><p>沙丁鱼不仅仅是一种普通的鱼；这个行业也代表着摄政社会——对于那些拥有生产资料的人来说，廉价的食物、辛勤的工作和轻松的利润！</p><p>   I have written two books on this period.
