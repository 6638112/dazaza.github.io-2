He accomplished this with a motley group of engineers, technicians, and mathematicians who were operating against all odds. With all the hardships and shortages of war and the indifference of their peers, the fact that they succeeded at all is a testament to their dedication and resourcefulness. And with the end of the war, more hardships have been piling on.</p><p>自1935年以来，柏林工程师Konrad Zuse已经花了他的整个职业发展一系列自动计算器，这是世界上第一个：Z1，Z2，Z3，S1，S2和Z4。他用一群商机，技术人员和数学家完成了这一点，他们正在反对所有赔率。随着战争的所有艰辛和缺乏对同行的漠不关心，他们取得成功的事实是他们奉献和努力的遗憾。随着战争的结束，艰难的艰辛已经打破了。</p><p> Two years ago, during the Battle of Berlin, bombers completely destroyed the Zuse family home and adjacent workshops on the Methfesselstraße, where they performed research and fabrication. All of the calculators, engineering drawings, and notes were lost in the rubble, save for the new Z4 nearing completion across the canal in another workshop on Oranienstraße. In the midst of all this, Zuse married in January of this year, but was immediately plunged into another crisis when the largest Allied air raid of the war destroyed the Oranienstraße workshop in February. They managed to rescue the Z4 from the basement, and miraculously arranged for it to be shipped out of the Berlin. Zuse, his family, and colleagues followed soon thereafter. Here and there along the escape route, they managed to complete the final assembly and testing of the Z4 — even giving a demonstration to the Aerodynamics Research Institute in Göttingen.</p><p> 两年前，在柏林战役中，轰炸机完全摧毁了综合家族家园和邻近的甲基脲的研讨会，在那里他们进行了研究和制造。所有计算器，工程图纸和笔记都在瓦砾中丢失，为新的Z4储蓄，即在Oranienstraße的另一个研讨会上完成整个运河的完成。在这一切中，Zuse在今年1月结婚，但是当最大的盟军在2月摧毁了奥拉尼亚斯·斯堡车间时，立即陷入了另一个危机。他们设法从地下室拯救Z4，并且奇迹般地安排将其摆脱柏林。 Zuse，他的家人和同事随后很快跟着。在这里和那里沿着逃生路线，他们设法完成了Z4的最终装配和测试 - 甚至发出哥廷根的空气动力学研究所的示范。</p><p> On arrival here in the Bavarian Alps, Zuse found a ragtag collection of refugees, including Dr Werner Von Braun and a team of 100 rocket scientists from Peenemünde. While everyone here is struggling just to stay alive and find food and shelter, Zuse is further worried with keeping his invention safe from prying eyes. Tensions have risen further upon circulation of a rumor that an SS leader, after three bottles of Cognac, let slip that his troops aren’t here to protect the scientists but to kill them all if the Americans or French approach.</p><p> 在抵达巴伐利亚阿尔卑斯山的抵达时，Zuse发现了一系列难民收藏，包括Werner Von Braun博士和来自Peenemünde的100个火箭科学家团队。虽然这里的每个人都在挣扎只是为了保持活力并找到食物和庇护所，但Zuse进一步担心让他的发明免受窥探的眼睛。紧张局势进一步上升，在谣言中循环一个谣言，在三瓶干邑白兰地之后，让他的军队不在这里保护科学家，而是如果美国人或法国的方法杀死他们所有人。</p><p> In the midst of all this madness, Zuse and his wife Gisela welcomed a baby boy, and have taken up residence in a Hinterstein farmhouse. Zuse spends his time working on something called a  Plankalkül, explaining that it is a mathematical language to allow people to communicate with these new machines. His other hobby is making woodblocks of the local scenery, and he plans to start a company to sell his devices once the economy recovers. There is no doubt that Konrad Zuse will soon be famous and known around the world as the father of automatic computers.</p><p> 在所有这个疯狂的中，唯一和他的妻子Gisela欢迎一个男婴，并在一个Hinterstein农舍居住。 Zuse花了他的时间在称为普利克兰普拉尔的东西上工作，解释它是一种数学语言，让人们可以与这些新机器进行交流。他的其他业余爱好正在制作当地风景的伍德布洛克，他计划一旦经济恢复，他就会开始一家销售他的设备。毫无疑问，Konrad Zuse很快将在世界各地作为自动计算机的父亲着名和众所周知。</p><p>  It was 80 years ago that  Konrad Zuse demonstrated his model Z3, an appropriate occasion to look back at his life and accomplishments. But despite the musings of our imaginary correspondent above, most people outside of computer history buffs have never heard of Konrad Zuse. How is it that someone created and built the world’s first programmable computer and yet is only a footnote in history?</p><p>  这是80年前，Konrad Zuse展示了他的模特Z3，一个适当的场合，以期待他的生命和成就。但尽管我们想象中上面的想象者的讲座，但大多数人以外的人在计算机历史遗迹之外从未听说过Konrad Zuse。如何创建和建立世界上第一个可编程计算机的人，但尚只是历史上的脚注？</p><p> Konrad Zuse had trouble finding his niche in life. As a young teen he seemed destined to become an engineer based on his interests and skills, always tinkering with erector sets and inventing gadgets. But he was also a talented sketch artist, photographer, and enjoyed acting in skits and plays. During his time at the  Technical University of Berlin, he changed majors twice. Initially put off by the rigid conformity of mechanical engineering, he switched to architecture, only to find it equally boring. He finally settled on civil engineering, which struck the right balance between engineer and artist.</p><p> Konrad Zuse在生活中发现了他的利基。作为一个年轻的青少年，他似乎注定要根据他的兴趣和技能成为一名工程师，总是用ercor lead和发明小工具来修补。但他也是一个有才华横溢的素描艺术家，摄影师，并享受在Skits和Play上的行为。在柏林技术大学的时间，他改变了两次。最初通过机械工程的刚性符合性推迟，他转换为架构，只能发现它同样无聊。他终于解决了土木工程，这在工程师和艺术家之间遇到了适当的平衡。</p><p>  After completing his studies in 1935, his first job was at the Henschel Airplane Works just outside of Berlin. But he quit after only a few months, turning his attention to something he had been pondering for some time — could he build a machine to automate those boring and repetitious engineering calculations?</p><p>  在1935年完成学业后，他的第一份工作是在柏林境外的亨舍尔飞机厂。但是他戒掉了几个月后，把注意力转向他一直在思考的东西 - 他可以建立一台机器来自动化那些无聊和重复的工程计算吗？ </p><p>  Zuse was working in almost complete isolation from others in the nascent field of computing. And initially, at least, he wasn’t so much focused on a general purpose computer as we think of it today. His goal was to make an automated mechanical adding machine of sorts, to handle the tedious calculations such as those required in static stress analyses. Early on, he made a key decision to use binary rather than decimal. He rightly saw that this would greatly simplify the building of such a machine, no matter what the implementation.</p><p>ZUES在新鲜的计算领域中几乎完全隔离。最初，至少，当我们今天想到它时，他并不是那么多于一般的电脑。他的目标是制作一个自动的机械加入机，以处理繁琐的计算，例如静态应力分析所需的繁琐计算。早期，他提出了使用二进制而不是十进制的关键决定。他正确地看到这将极大地简化了这样的机器的建筑，无论什么都是什么。</p><p> You might think that the choice of binary numbers would immediately make relays the most obvious choice. And while he did experiments with relays, they were ruled too unreliable. Today we take for granted the reliability and quality of relays, but Zuse was living in 1930s Germany and operating on a shoestring budget supported by his family and friends. Relays were expensive, and they were designed to switch infrequently, not run continuously at many Hertz. The relays that he could obtain were more often than not discards his friends rescued from the trash at the local telephone exchange. Along with his friend Helmut Schreyer, they also experimented with using of vacuum tubes, but realized that technology would be significantly delayed due to wartime shortages.</p><p> 您可能会认为二进制数的选择将立即使继电器成为最明显的选择。虽然他用继电器进行了实验，但它们被统治得太不可靠。今天，我们认为理所当然的继电器和质量，但Zuse生活在20世纪30年代德国，并在他的家人和朋友支持的鞋带预算上运营。继电器是昂贵的，它们设计为不经常切换，而不是在许多赫兹不断运行。他可以获得的继电器比在当地电话交换机上丢弃他的朋友撤消他的朋友。除了他的朋友Helmut Schreyer一起，他们还通过使用真空管进行实验，但意识到由于战时短缺，技术将被显着延迟。</p><p>  So how did he implement a computer without relays or vacuum tubes? It was all mechanical. Zuse devised a clever arrangement of plates, flat bars, and steel pins to make a digital memory store and a floating point binary arithmetic logic unit (ALU).</p><p>  那么他是如何在没有继电器或真空管的情况下实施计算机的？这是机械的。 ZUES设计了巧妙的板式布置，平板杆和钢引脚，以制作数字存储器商店和浮点二进制算术逻辑单元（ALU）。</p><p>  This  video explains the basic operation of the mechanical adder (don’t let the fact that it’s in German discourage you from watching it).</p><p>  该视频解释了机械加法器的基本操作（不要让德国令人沮丧地观看它）。</p><p> If you want to dig into how Zuse implemented memory and an ALU mechanically, check out [fjkraan]’s project explaining  the basics and OpenSCAD 3D printer examples you can make yourself:</p><p> 如果您想挖掘如何机械地实现内存和ALU，请查看[FJKraan]的项目解释基础和OpenSCAD 3D打印机示例，您可以自己制作：</p><p>   The memory consisted of 64 each 22-bit words ( 14-bits of mantissa and 8-bits of exponent and sign). The ALU could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The program instructions were provided on punched tapes, and consisted of only eight operations:</p><p>   内存包括64个每22位字（14位尾数和8位指数和标志）。 ALU可以添加，减去，乘以和分开。程序指令在冲压胶带上提供，并由八项操作组成：</p><p>  The computer’s clock was equivalent to a four-phase CPU clock of modern times. But it was mechanical rather than electrical, and could be driven by either a hand crank or an electric motor. Each clock phase was one of four planar motions — imagine pushing a square plate a few centimeters North, then West, then South, then East back to the starting point. Each phase performed a basic operation, and fortunately no basic operation took more than three of these cycles.</p><p>  计算机的时钟相当于现代的四相CPU时钟。但它是机械而不是电气，并且可以由手曲柄或电动机驱动。每个时钟阶段都是四个平面运动之一 - 想象一下北方几厘米的平方板，然后西，然后南，然后向东回到起点。每个阶段执行了基本操作，幸运的是，没有基本操作占这些周期的三个以上。 </p><p> As hinted to by the instruction set, Zuse also built converters to permit the use of human-friendly decimal numbers for input and output. Paper tape was too rare a commodity at the time, so another solution was needed. They found that blank 35 mm movie film worked just fine, and wrote their programs using a hand-held hole punch.</p><p>暗示指令集的暗示，Zuse还建立了转换器以允许使用用于输入和输出的人友好的十进制数。当时纸带太罕见了商品，所以需要另一种解决方案。他们发现空白的35毫米电影电影工作得很好，并使用手持孔打孔写入他们的程序。</p><p>  The Z1 was finished in 1938, but was never very reliable. But it wasn’t meant to be a finished product, only a proof-of-concept prototype. Work next began on the Z2, which was planned to test whether relays could would be suitable. Zuse kept the mechanical memory for the Z2, but replaced the ALU with a relay version, but only operating on fixed-point numbers. It was completed and successfully demonstrated in 1938, whereupon Zuse received partial funding to build a successor model.</p><p>  Z1于1938年结束，但从来都不是非常可靠的。但这并不意味着是一个成品，只有一个概念验证原型。下一步开始在Z2上开始，计划测试继电器是否适合。 ZUES保持Z2的机械存储器，但用继电器版本替换了ALU，但仅在固定点号上运行。它在1938年完成并成功展示，随后Zuse接受了部分资金来构建继任模型。</p><p> The Z3 was designed entirely with relays. It was basically an improvement on the Z1, was faster and more reliable. It was delivered and demonstrated on 12 May 1941, and then Zuse began construction of yet another computer, the Z4 mentioned in the introduction. The Z4 expanded on the Z3, adding new features like square root, punch tape output, multiple tape input units, and a conditional branch instruction. Zuse continued to use relays in the ALU, but returned to the mechanical memory because of its greater density. The Z4 was eventually put into full time service and operated from 1950 until 1959.</p><p> Z3完全与继电器设计。它基本上对Z1的改进，更快，更可靠。它于1941年5月12日交付并展示，然后ZUES开始构建另一台计算机，Z4在引言中提到的Z4。 Z4在Z3上扩展，添加了平方根，打孔输出，多胶带输入单元等新功能和条件分支指令。 ZUES继续在ALU中使用继电器，但由于其密度更大，因此返回机械记忆。 Z4最终投入全职服务，并从1950年到1959年运营。</p><p>  As the Z3 project was underway, a request came from Henschel for help in the production of guided missile wings. Zuse built what are probably the first process control computers, the S1 and S2, and invented an analog to digital converter. These single-purpose computers followed the contour of newly-manufactured wings as a hundred analog-to-digital-equipped rollers measured their curvatures.</p><p>  随着Z3项目进行，请求来自Henschel，有助于生产导弹翅膀。 Zuse构建了什么是第一个过程控制计算机，S1和S2，并发明了一个模数转换器。这些单一用途计算机遵循新制造的翅膀的轮廓，因为一百个模数配备的滚轮测量了它们的曲线。</p><p> The machines would then automatically calculate the required trim for the tail surfaces and ailerons from this data, a task that previously been done by a dozen computers (people, not machines). After performing their jobs around the clock for two years, the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, and the S1 and S2 were either destroyed or possibly captured by the Soviets.</p><p> 然后，机器将自动计算来自此数据的尾表面和jilerons的所需装饰，这是一个先前由十几台计算机（人，而不是机器）完成的任务。在围绕时钟进行两年后，工厂于1944年爆炸摧毁，S1和S2被摧毁或被苏联捕获。</p><p> If you want to learn more about each model, check out this  extensive website describing all the computers and much more. It was made by Konrad Zuse’s son who was born in the introduction above,  Prof Horst Zuse, who became an electrical engineer, a software engineer, and an expert on computer history.</p><p> 如果您想了解有关每个型号的更多信息，请查看此广泛的网站，描述所有计算机等等。它是由Konrad Zuse的儿子制作的，他出生在上面的介绍，霍斯特·Zuse，他们成为电气工程师，软件工程师和计算机历史专家。</p><p>  Zuse and his team were able to switch back and forth between mechanical, relay, and even vacuum tube realizations of the computer components because of Zuse’s grasp on the underlying equations at work. He developed his own system of rules and notation, until his former math teacher told him he had reinvented propositional calculus, or Boolean algebra as is more commonly used today. By reducing the computer operations into equations, the design concepts were separated from the physical construction, making it easier to jump back and forth between implementations.</p><p>  Zuse和他的团队能够在机械，继电器和甚至是计算机组件的机械，继电器和甚至真空管的过程之间来回转换，因为ZUSE在工作中的底层方程上掌握。他制定了自己的规则和符号系统，直到他的前数学老师告诉他他已经重新发明了命题微积分，或者今天更常用的布尔代数。通过将计算机操作降低到方程式中，设计概念与物理结构分开，使得更容易在实现之间来回跳。 </p><p> Zuse realized that with the framework, what we would call a computer language today, the computer could do so much more than just solve equations. He had been thinking of such a language since 1939, and in the immediate aftermath of the war, he spent much of his time formalizing what he called  Plankalkül, the first high-level programming language for a computer — in English, it translates as  a formal system for planning. Despite Zuse’s high hopes, Plankalkül never took off, although some say that elements of it can be found in Algol 58, albeit uncredited.</p><p>ZUES意识到，通过框架，我们今天会称之为计算机语言，计算机可以不仅仅是解决方程的方式。自1939年以来一直在思考这种语言，并在战争的直接之后，他花了很多时间正式地形成了他所谓的Plankalkül，这是一个计算机的第一级高级编程语言 - 用英语翻译为一个正式规划系统。尽管Zuse的高希望，Plankalkül从未起飞，尽管有些人说它的元素可以在Algol 58中找到，尽管未经认可。</p><p>   Zuse made patent applications for many of his inventions, and a number of patents were issued. His patent for the computer itself, would be frustrated. He filed a patent application on 16 Jun 1941. It wasn’t until after the war in 1952 that the German Patent Office  published his claims. No company in the whole industry objected, except for one — the  Triumph calculator company filed opposition to the patent, later revealed to be backed by IBM. The court case lingered for years, only to ultimately be rejected in 1967 on the grounds that the invention was not worthy of a patent.</p><p>   Zuse为他的许多发明制作了专利申请，并发出了许多专利。他为计算机本身的专利，会沮丧。他于1941年6月16日提出了专利申请。直到1952年战争后，德国专利局发表了索赔。在整个行业中没有公司反对，除了一个 - 凯旋计算器公司向该专利提出反对，后来透露将被IBM支持。法院案件多年来一直徘徊，仅在1967年最终被拒绝，理由是本发明不值得专利。</p><p> The innovation and progressiveness of the object concerned in the main application are not doubted. Yet a patent cannot be granted due to insufficient inventive merit.</p><p> 没有怀疑主要申请中有关物体的创新和进展。然而，由于发明优点不足，无法授予专利。</p><p> In the meantime, Zuse had begun commercializing his own line of computers. There was a false start with IBM, who wanted the patents but wouldn’t let Zuse continue development.  Remington Rand became an important early client, followed closely by the  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich who took delivery of the Z4 in 1950. Business grew over the next 15 years, with a series of computers and even a plotter,  the Graphomat 64. But by the mid 1960s the company was having financial troubles, and it was acquired by Siemens in 1967.</p><p> 与此同时，Zuse已经开始将自己的计算机线商业化。 IBM有一个错误的开始，谁想要专利，但不会让Zuse继续发展。雷明顿兰德成为一个重要的早期客户，紧随其后的是苏黎世瑞士联邦理工学院（Eth），在苏黎世在1950年携带Z4的交付。业务在未来15年内增长，其中一系列电脑甚至绘图仪GraphyMat 64.但到20世纪60年代中期，该公司具有财务问题，并于1967年由西门子收购。</p><p>  As with many historical computers that have been destroyed or sold for scrap, there have been several recreations of Zuse’s computers built over the years.</p><p>  与已销毁或销售废料的许多历史计算机一样，多年来已经有几个Zuse的计算机娱乐。</p><p>  With support from Siemens, Zuse began a project in 1984 to reconstruct the Z1. It was completed in 1989 and is  now on display at the  German Museum of Technology in Berlin. Prof Raúl Rojas of the Free University of Berlin has written an  excellent, in-depth paper on how the Z1 and its reconstruction work. Regarding this project, Zuse once remarked:</p><p>  通过Siemens的支持，Zuse于1984年开始了一个项目，以重建Z1。它于1989年完成，目前正在展示柏林德国技术博物馆。柏林自由大学的RaúlGojas教授已经写了一个优秀的深入的论文，就Z1及其重建工作。关于这个项目，Zuse曾经评论过：</p><p> Back then, it didn’t function very well, and in that regard, this replica is very reliable — it also doesn’t work well.</p><p> 然后，它没有很好地运行，并且在这方面，这个副本非常可靠 - 它也不好起来。 </p><p>  The relay-based Z3 has been reconstructed three times. First, in 1961, Zuse himself built a replica that is still on display in the  Deutsches Museum in Munich. Again in 1997, Profs Raúl Rojas and Horst Zuse built a recreation that is now on display  Konrad Zuse Museum in Hünfeld, Germany. And most recently, Prof Horst Zuse built an original size reconstruction which was installed at the Konrad Zuse museum in 2010.</p><p>基于继电器的Z3已重建三次。首先，在1961年，Zuse本人建立了一份仍在慕尼黑德意志博物馆展出的复制品。 1997年再次，RaúlGojas和Horst Zuse教授建立了一项娱乐，现在在德国Hünfeld的展示Konrad Zuse Museum。最近，Horst Zuse教授建造了一个原始的大小重建，该重建于2010年在Konrad Zuse Museum安装。</p><p>  And speaking of replicas, this is a replica of Konrad Zuse himself, in the form of a LEGO brick man, holding a relay storage unit from the Z3 computer.</p><p>  并谈到复制品，这是konrad zuse本人的复制品，以乐高砖头的形式，从z3计算机上拿着一个继电器存储单元。</p><p>   Zuse had the misfortune to have made his most important invention in times of war. Otherwise, the practical, entrepreneurial Zuse might be known today not only as a technology pioneer, but also as the founder of a global technology corporation of the stature of Bill Gates.</p><p>   Zuse在战争时期犯了他最重要的发明。否则，今天可能知道实用，创业ZUES，不仅是技术先驱，而且作为贝尔盖茨的全球技术公司的创始人。</p><p> It does make you wonder why Konrad Zuse isn’t well known and why his groundbreaking inventions and computers are often ignored. Whether or not he made the first programmable computer, his contributions were undeniably significant, well ahead of their time, and deserve better recognition. Konrad Zuse’s accomplishments are best summarized by Eric Weiss, who wrote  Zuse’s obituary for the IEEE in 1996 :</p><p> 它确实让你想知道为什么Konrad Zuse尚未众所周知，为什么他的突破性发明和计算机经常被忽略。无论他是否制作了第一个可编程计算机，他的贡献都是无可否认的，超越他们的时间，并应得更好的认可。 Konrad Zuse的成就是由Eric Weiss的最重要的综述，他在1996年写下Zuse Zuse ofeee的oeee：</p><p> Zuse was a man of many talents. He was a persistent, innovative, and extraordinarily creative engineering designer and builder, a mathematical logician, the founder of several successful computing manufacturing businesses, and an impressive artist. His countrymen and the computing world will remember him chiefly for the concepts of the first Z machines but also for his entrepreneurial companies, successfully created and operated, almost without outside help under the most trying conditions.</p><p> Zuse是一个有很多人才的人。他是一个持久的，创新，非常具有创新的工程设计师和建设者，一个数学逻辑师，一个成功的计算制造商家的创始人，以及令人印象深刻的艺术家。他的同胞和计算世界都将记住他，主要是针对第一个Z机器的概念，也是他的企业家公司，成功创造和运营，几乎没有外部帮助，在最艰难的条件下。</p><p> Below the break is a 1958 television broadcast with Zuse (English subtitles are available) and some additional resources about Konrad Zuse.</p><p> 低于休息是1958年电视广播，Zuse（英文字幕可用）和关于KONRAD ZUSE的一些额外资源。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/2021/06/16/the-other-first-computer-konrad-zuse-and-the-z3/">https://hackaday.com/2021/06/16/the-other-first-computer-konrad-zuse-and-the-z3/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电脑/">#电脑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/conrad/">#conrad</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/zuse/">#zuse</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
