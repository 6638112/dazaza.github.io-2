However, as a non-native English speaker I was intimidated and reluctant to attend Scala conferences. Heather Miller, a professor at my university at the time and a prominent Scala community leader, encouraged me to attend and in 2018 I attended my first conference at NEScala where I met Jon Pretty.</p><p> 三年前，我是21岁的本科大学生，他是对Scala热烈的，并希望参与其周围的社区。然而，作为非母语英语扬声器，我被吓倒和不愿参加了Scala会议。 Heather Miller是我大学的教授，以及一个着名的Scala社区领导者，鼓励我参加，并在2018年参加了我在Nescala的第一次会议上，我遇到了Jon漂亮。</p><p> Jon Pretty was one of the first people I met in the community and he quickly gained my trust by highlighting me on Twitter, connecting me with well-known open source maintainers and influential figures in the community. He told me that he had recommended me to the conference that accepted my talk, which led me to believe that he was the reason why I was chosen as a speaker. I trusted that he was a mentor and a close friend and believed that I couldn’t have joined the community so quickly without him.</p><p> 乔恩漂亮是我在社区中遇到的第一个人之一，他通过在Twitter上突出显示我来迅速获得了我的信任，将我与社区中着名的开源维护者和有影响力的人物联系起来。他告诉我，他向我推荐了接受我的谈话的会议，这让我相信他是我被选为发言人的原因。我相信他是一个导师和一个亲密的朋友，相信没有他，我无法如此迅速加入社区。</p><p> In our conversations, he also mentioned a few times where he helped other women to attend conferences that they otherwise couldn’t have attended by sharing Airbnbs with them to reduce their travel costs. He asked if I wanted to share an Airbnb on my trip to the Typelevel conference in Berlin. He also mentioned that he planned to invite others. As a student with limited financial resources, I accepted the tempting offer and felt grateful that, once again, he helped me. At first, he mentioned that I could invite others to join our Airbnb. Having attended only two conferences, I did not know many people at the time. When I thought of a person to invite, he stopped me and asked if I was not feeling comfortable sleeping in the same apartment as him, and if I was trying to get a chaperone for us. I felt bad that I made him feel untrusted and stopped asking others to join.</p><p> 在我们的谈话中，他还提到了几次，他帮助其他女性参加会议，以至于他们无法与他们分享航空公司以减少其旅行费用而无法参加的会议。他问我是否想在柏林的Typelevel会议上分享Airbnb。他还提到他计划邀请别人。作为财务资源有限的学生，我接受了诱人的报价，感到不满，再次，他帮助了我。起初，他提到我可以邀请别人加入我们的航空公司。只参加了两个会议，我当时不了很多人。当我想到一个人来邀请时，他阻止了我，问我是否没有感到舒适地在与他一样睡觉，如果我试图为我们获得陪伴。我感觉不好，我让他感到不受信任并停止要求其他人加入。</p><p> When I arrived in Berlin, I found out that the airline lost my luggage and my electronics were dying without chargers. I was jet lagged, tired, frustrated, and disoriented in a foreign country. I was hungry and therefore bought some food. Remembering that he had suggested I get milk and wine in our previous conversation, I also bought them. I don’t remember how much I drank. I don’t remember him drinking. But I remember feeling uncomfortable when he made advances on me. I felt being taken advantage of that he had unprotected sex with me when I was intoxicated. Nothing felt right. I remember panicking and crying.</p><p> 当我抵达柏林时，我发现航空公司失去了行李，我的电子产品在没有充电器的情况下死亡。我被外国人滞后，疲惫，沮丧，迷失方向。我饿了，因此买了一些食物。记住他建议我在之前的谈话中得到牛奶和葡萄酒，我也买了它们。我不记得我喝了多少钱。我不记得他喝酒。但是当他对我的进步时，我记得感到不舒服。当我陶醉时，我觉得正在利用他与我无保护的性行为。什么都没有感觉到。我记得恐慌和哭泣。</p><p> During those horrifying days, I felt that he was treating me as an object. For instance, he distanced me at conferences but wanted to be intimate in Airbnb. There was another time that he insisted on having intercourse regardless of me saying I didn’t want to. I did not blame him for what happened, and didn’t think those behaviors were problematic at the time, because it didn’t even cross my mind that he would do anything that I wasn’t comfortable with. I trusted that he would not hurt me. I even blamed myself for not being clear.</p><p> 在那些可怕的日子里，我觉得他是一个对象的对象。例如，他在会议上致散我，但希望在Airbnb中亲密。还有另一个时候，他坚持有不管我说我不想的话。我没有责怪他发生的事情，并不认为这些行为当时是有问题的，因为它甚至不穿过我的想法，他会做任何我不舒服的事情。我相信他不会伤害我。我甚至归咎于自己不清楚。 </p><p> I was feeling overwhelmed and emotionally stressed during that time, I mentioned to him that I wanted to reach out to my parents for support. He discouraged me by saying that my parents would not be able to help me since they are away in a different country. I felt ashamed, isolated, and scared.</p><p>我在那个时候感到不知所措，情绪强调，我向他提到的是，我想向父母联系以获得支持。他通过说我的父母无法帮助我，因为他们在一个不同的国家，我劝阻我。我觉得惭愧，孤立，害怕。</p><p> In June, Heather noticed that I was upset at a dinner after ScalaDays. I shared with her about what happened. She warned me to stay away from Jon Pretty. And she wasn’t the only person who told me that. Even though my experience in Berlin was awful, it was difficult for me to accept that someone, who seemed like a good friend, mentor, and ally, could be so selfish, manipulative, and cruel.</p><p> 6月，希瑟注意到，在萨克拉地区之后，我在晚餐时感到不安。我和她分享了发生的事情。她警告我留在乔恩漂亮。她不是唯一一个告诉我的人。尽管我在柏林的经历是可怕的，但我很难接受那些似乎是一个好朋友，导师和盟友的人，可能是如此自私，操纵和残忍。</p><p> I maintained friendship with him for a few months after May, because I was convinced that it was all consensual and I didn’t want to “make a big scene” like he accused me of. In addition, he asked me to not dwell too much on that episode. As an inexperienced young woman from a patriarchal culture, I was running away from the stereotype of being thought of as someone “traditional”. I should, like he implied, and wanted to be “cool about everything that happened”. I was lacking the knowledge to identify abusive behaviors from sexual interactions. Maybe I was inexperienced, or maybe he was too experienced at convincing people of it.</p><p> 我在5月后与他保持友谊，因为我相信这一切都是一致的，我不想“制作一个大场景”，就像他指责我一样。另外，他让我不要在这一集上居住。作为一个来自父权制文化的缺乏经验的年轻女性，我逃离了被认为是“传统”被认为的刻板印象。我应该，就像他暗示，并希望“很酷的事情很酷”。我缺乏识别来自性互动的滥用行为的知识。也许我缺乏经验，或者也许他在令人信服的人时也经历过。</p><p> I was heavily gaslighted to invalidate my memories. The stories he presented were always very different from what I remembered. For example, when I confronted him in person about the episode in Berlin, he told me that I had lured him. His words left me scared, humiliated, and ashamed. I found myself self-doubting, distressed, and depressed.</p><p> 我很愤怒地使我的记忆失效。他所呈现的故事总是与我所记忆的总是不同的。例如，当我对柏林的剧集面对他时，他告诉我，我诱惑了他。他的话让我害怕，羞辱和羞愧。我发现自己自己是自我怀疑，苦恼，沮丧。</p><p> Even several months later, I continued to suffer from stress and panic attacks. I started therapy sessions. From talking to my therapist about what happened, I started recognizing predatory, gaslighting, and abusive behaviors. When I shared with my friends and family about my experience, they all told me to stay away from him.</p><p> 甚至几个月后，我继续患有压力和恐慌的攻击。我开始治疗课程。从与我的治疗师交谈时，我开始认识到掠夺性，气候和辱骂行为。当我与朋友和家人分享我的经历时，他们都告诉我远离他。</p><p> I started reflecting about my experience and started my journey of realising what happened to me. I expressed several times, in various forms of communication, that I wish not to engage in more conversations with him. His presence, online or in-person, has caused me lots of pain, stress, and even harm. My boundaries were constantly being violated. He continued to engage me in different conversations, “emotionally trolling” me (in his words), and publicly accosted me and insinuated himself into my space. Here are a few incidents (but not all):</p><p> 我开始反思我的经历，并开始了实现发生在我身上的旅程。我以各种形式的沟通表达了几次，我希望不要与他进行更多的对话。他的存在，在线或亲自，使我造成很多痛苦，压力，甚至伤害。我的界限不断被侵犯。他继续在不同的谈话中吸引我，“情绪上拖息”我（用他的话说），并公开召唤我并暗示自己进入我的空间。以下是一些事件（但不是全部）：</p><p> He mentioned that he didn’t want me to stop talking to him because he thought that I “can become successful and valuable in this field” and that he had a lot to offer. I felt threatened mentally and physically.</p><p> 他提到他不想让我停止与他交谈，因为他认为我“可以在这个领域取得成功和有价值”，他有很多东西要提供。我感到精神上和身体威胁。 </p><p> At Scale by the Bay 2018, Seth Tisue and I were having a conversation in a small booth, Jon Pretty physically blocked the door and directed the conversation to a different topic. I was sitting there forced to hear him talk before I could walk away. I was scared to show any negative emotion because I could be seen as crazy and unreasonable.</p><p>在2018年湾的规模，Seth Tisue和我在一个小摊位上进行了谈话，乔恩很漂亮地阻挡了门，并指向对话给不同的话题。在我走开之前，我坐在那里被迫听到他说话。我害怕表现出任何负面情绪，因为我可以被视为疯狂和不合理。</p><p> After the conference, he joined a group dinner that I planned to attend ahead of time. I broke down in front of Ely in the restroom because his presence triggered so many terrible memories and emotions. Ely helped to arrange me to leave dinner early.</p><p> 会议结束后，他加入了一个小组晚宴，我计划提前参加。因为他的存在引发了这么多可怕的回忆和情感，我在洗手间前面闯入了厕所前面。帮助我安排我早晚晚餐。</p><p> He forced me to hug him at Lambda World 2018. He said he knew that he wouldn’t get into trouble doing that because I also hugged other people who were my friends.</p><p> 他迫使我在2018年兰姆达世界拥抱他。他说他知道他不会遇到麻烦，因为我也拥抱了其他人的朋友。</p><p> At NEScala 2019, he stopped by the registration desk, where I was helping Brian Clapper, and tried to speak to me. I ignored him by looking away.</p><p> 在Nescala 2019年，他被登记处停了下来，我正在帮助Brian Prapper，并试图和我说话。看着别处我忽略了他。</p><p> At Scale by the Bay 2019, Adelbert Chang and I were sitting by a table at lunch, he walked towards us. Adelbert is one of my friends who I shared with about what happened. Knowing that I did not want him approaching me, Adelbert asked him to chat somewhere else.</p><p> 在2019年湾的规模，阿德尔伯特·张和我坐在午餐时坐在一张桌子上，走向我们。阿德尔伯特是我与发生的事情分享的朋友之一。知道我不想让他接近我，阿德尔伯特让他聊在别的地方。</p><p> Looking back, there were also times in our conversation where he made problematic comments that made me feel uncomfortable. He bragged to me about close interactions with at least ten women in the Scala community: coffee, dates, kisses, and sex. I found that in many of those stories, it was almost always women being charmed by him and “liked him too much” (in his words). Knowing how he described our situation, and learning about narcissism and gaslighting, I have reasons not to trust his characterizations of his interactions with these women. I have met some of them in-person at conferences before. Many of us fit into the profile of: young, new to tech or the community, non-native English speakers, have a minority background (race, education, financial…), lacking the knowledge of sexual or abusive behaviors, etc.</p><p> 回顾一下，我们的谈话中还有时间，他提出了问题的评论让我感到不舒服。他吹嘘我在Scala社区与至少十名女性的密切互动：咖啡，日期，亲吻和性别。我发现在许多这些故事中，几乎总是女性被他迷住，“非常喜欢他”（以他的话说）。了解他如何描述我们的情况，并了解自恋和散装，我有理由不相信他与这些妇女的互动的特征。我以前在会议上遇到过其中一些人。我们中的许多人都适合：年轻，新的技术或社区，非母语英语扬声器，拥有少数背景（种族，教育，财务......），缺乏性或辱骂行为的知识等。</p><p> I have reported all of my experience to the ScalaCenter in 2019. I was hoping to see concrete actions, such as building a reporting mechanism, to protect minorities in the community. Unfortunately, I am not aware of such actions taken. I did not speak up in public because I was convinced that he was powerful, authoritative, influential, and popular in the community, and that it would be easy for him to destroy my career, which had just begun. In addition, many people in the community saw him as a friend and no one would have trusted me and my experience.</p><p> 我已经向2019年报告了我对屠宰场的所有经验。我希望看到建设报告机制等具体行动，以保护社区中的少数群体。不幸的是，我不知道采取了这样的行动。我没有在公共场合发表讲话，因为我相信他是在社区中的强大，权威，有影响力的，并且很受欢迎，并且他将很容易地摧毁我的职业生涯，刚刚开始。此外，社区中的许多人认为他是朋友，没有人会相信我和我的经历。 </p><p> One month ago, I watched the documentary, Filthy Rich. And I am absolutely in awe of women, such as Sarah Ransome and Amy McClure, who have stood up and confronted their abuser, regardless of the power the abuser had. I admire their courage and their determination to protect others. In addition, connecting with Vic and learning about  her similar experience with Jon Pretty made me realize that I wasn’t alone. Knowing that more women in the community were targeted recently, I realized that this type of behavior will never stop if people are not aware.</p><p>一个月前，我看着纪录片，肮脏的富裕。而且我绝对是敬畏的女性，如莎拉·勒罗姆和艾米麦克里·麦克里，他们站起来绑架，无论施工者的权力如何。我钦佩他们的勇气和他们保护他人的决心。此外，与VIC联系并学习与JON漂亮的类似经验让我意识到我并不孤单。了解最近举办社区中更多的女性，我意识到这种行为永远不会停止，如果人们不知道。</p><p>  Today, I am speaking up. It took me three years to gain my voice back, I will not be silenced or intimidated again. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything. I simply want to share my story and make peace with my traumatizing experience. And perhaps by speaking up, I can take my stolen power back. And perhaps, my story will help people learn about predatory and abusive behaviors. And perhaps, I can help prevent the next woman from being harmed.</p><p>  今天，我在说话。我花了三年的时间来获得声音，我不会沉默或再次吓倒。我不是想说服任何人。我只是想分享我的故事并与我的创伤经验和平。也许通过发言，我可以把我的被盗的力量带回。也许，我的故事将帮助人们了解掠夺性和辱骂行为。也许，我可以帮助防止下一个女人受到伤害。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://yifanxing.medium.com/my-experience-with-sexual-harassment-in-the-scala-community-9245b4a139de">https://yifanxing.medium.com/my-experience-with-sexual-harassment-in-the-scala-community-9245b4a139de</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/社区/">#社区</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sexual/">#sexual</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
