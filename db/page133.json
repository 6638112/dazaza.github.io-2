"note_en": "&#39;Treat her gently&#39;: How an Israeli military search team helped recover majority of Surfside victims\n The Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 National Rescue Unit recovered 81 of the 97 victims from the Champlain Towers South condo collapse site in Surfside.\n     When Lt. Col.\u00a0Golan Vach, commander of the Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 National Rescue Unit, located a man\u2019s ring while searching the debris field of the collapsed Champlain Towers South in Surfside, he knew immediately to whom it belonged.\n He knew, because he had met with\u00a0families of the scores of\u00a0missing people. He had studied\u00a0photographs of the missing,\u00a0learned about  their possessions \u2014 a necklace with a heart pendant, a gold watch, a blue table.\n He had\u00a0learned about the habits of each potential victim\u00a0and\u00a0even knew in which room each likely would have been\u00a0during the collapse.\n And, amid unimaginable tangles of rebar jutting out from a\u00a0sea of concrete that was once their homes, he knew precisely where each\u00a0victim\u00a0would be located.\n  He personally found 20. His team, he said, recovered 81 by the time the last member departed Surfside\u00a0on July 11.\u00a0In all, the Israeli team found about 84% of the nearly 100 victims.\n \u201cThis is the way we were working, like detectives,\u201d Vach said. \u201cYou have these stupid, simple, brilliant signs. You dig here, and you will find the people you are looking for. And it worked.\u201d\n     In a series of exclusive, in-depth phone calls, emails and video chats from his home in Beit Rimon \u2014 located about 15 miles\u00a0west of the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel \u2014 Vach described the integral role the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) played in recovering victims from the partially collapsed, 13-story, 136-unit condominium complex.\n  Rubble to untrained eye, each piece was part of a puzzle that led to victims\n What the untrained eye saw\u00a0as a pile of rubble\u00a0the IDF team viewed as a building in puzzle form. And each piece, whether a stone column, slab of concrete, or crushed family heirloom, pointed them toward where a victim might be found.\n Sadly, their success would not result in anyone&#39;s rescue, but rather in bringing closure\u00a0and solace\u00a0to grieving loved ones and providing\u00a0them an opportunity to say goodbye and begin to heal their broken hearts.\n  Vach related\u00a0how,  within hours of receiving approval from the U.S. to join the rescue efforts, his team boarded a commercial flight to Miami.\n On the plane were 15 of his\u00a0delegation&#39;s \u201cbest people,\u201d Vach said. They arrived at 8 a.m. on Sunday, June 27, the morning of the fourth day of rescue efforts. And while they were not scheduled to begin work until noon, he said, the team headed straight to the collapse site.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s like a race where most of the runners began a few seconds ahead and you are trying to catch them,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter 72 hours, we had to work very tight, very hard, to be onsite 24/7 to try to find out if there are still signs of a living person.\u201d\n The first thing Vach did, he said, was request a list of missing persons. But he said authorities told him they could not release that information.\n   Knowing precise and meticulous\u00a0details provided by family members would be\u00a0crucial to\u00a0rescue efforts, members of Vach\u2019s team immediately began the task of searching out\u00a0parents, siblings, adult children, cousins and other loved ones stuck in\u00a0agonizing wait for word on rescue efforts.\n &#34;I know from experience that each hour is expensive in those kinds of incidents,&#34; Vach\u00a0said.\n They found many families staying in the same hotel where the IDF team was housed.\u00a0In only six to eight hours, he recalled, one of his team members came to him with what she determined would be the number of people for whom they should be searching. But that number didn\u2019t match the one put out by U.S. authorities.\n  \u201cI said, \u2018But the official numbers are 159. How come you have only 98?\u2019\u201d Vach said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018This is it. There will be no more than 98 or 99. Not a single one more.\u2019\u201d\n As of Friday, 97\u00a0victims had been identified, reported Miami-Dade Police, with one\u00a0more\u00a0categorized as \u201cpotentially missing.\u201d\n    While half of Vach\u2019s team met with victims\u2019 families, the other half deployed to the rubble pile,\u00a0Vach said. There, they found first responders digging in\u00a0areas where search dogs were barking.\n Based on\u00a0vast\u00a0experience, Vach said, he believed the\u00a0rescuers would need a \u201cmuch wider methodology to try to evaluate where exactly people were buried in the site.\u201d\n  His team did not use dogs, he said, but rather a formula that\u00a0had\u00a0been honed over\u00a0almost 40 years. It was expertise developed from responder missions in wars and catastrophic events in Israel\u00a0and around the world, including in Lebanon, Cyprus, Haiti, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Honduras and India. The team had\u00a0even been on hand to assist during Hurricane Katrina when it flooded and devastated New Orleans in\u00a02005.\n  So, like attempting to solve the most gruesome of puzzles, Vach\u2019s team poured its sweeping\u00a0knowledge into studying the pile of\u00a0concrete, rebar and\u00a0assorted building materials along with victims&#39; consumer goods and personal possessions.\n The team\u00a0also amassed\u00a0what\u00a0Vach\u00a0called &#34;field rescue intelligence,&#34; which included collaborating with other first responders.\n They identified dividing lines between floors, determined where columns intersected units and where hallways once linked neighbor to neighbor.\n  With help from his team back in Israel, Vach&#39;s group developed 2-D and 3-D computer models to determine how the building had fallen and\u00a0where there might be \u201cvoids&#39;&#39; or crevices that could support life.\n The result was a series of digital images\u00a0that showed precisely where each room was located both before and after the collapse: red for bedrooms, blue for dining rooms, green for kitchens, yellow for corridors. A dark red triangle marked the spot where a\u00a0victim should be found.\n  The team marked\u00a0each column, each room, each floor in the pile. Orange spray paint and red brick \u2014 that was the ninth floor. Blue spray paint segregated the entire debris field into a grid.\n The team created a \u201cfragile reality,\u201d calculating and mapping how far one victim might have landed from another. That way, rescuers could search with purpose, measuring out the distance and direction \u2014 13 feet to the west, 33\u00bd\u00a0feet to the south, 29 feet to the east \u2014 from each\u00a0victim to where another might be found.\n  And so continued the meticulous process of diagramming the site. With each person or personal item recovered and identified, the team confirmed or modified their model.\n \u201cEach item that they found is an anchor to correct the plan,\u201d Vach said. \u201cIf I assume I am on Floor 4 in apartment 404, but I found a blue table, and I know the blue table belonged to Apartment 3, not 4, then something is incorrect, something moved. And I have to correct my plan.\u201d\n  Once, he said, another rescuer found a deceased dog and was about to discard it.\n \u201cI said, \u201cNo, no stop!&#39;\u201d Vach said. \u201cLook at\u00a0this building \u2014 according to what we know there were only two dogs. One was a pit bull and one was a big gray dog. Each dog belonged to a different apartment. If we know exactly where you found this dog, we can try to correct our plan.\u201d\n  Vach seemed to know every unit number, every resident of Champlain Towers South. At the mention of either, he can identify\u00a0the other. Unit 1104,  Itty and Tzvi Ainsworth. Parents to seven, grandparents to 30.\n \u201cWhen I sat with the Ainsworth family, they were the only family that I described in detail how I found them, extracted them, pulled them out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n  Vach recovered Stella Cattarossi, the 7-year-old daughter of a Miami-Dade firefighter who was also part of the search-and-rescue team. The child was\u00a0near the body of her mother and grandparents, who lived in unit 501.\n  Two other victims were located with the help of his team back in Israel, Vach\u00a0said, after he found a tiny plaque that read \u201cRabbi A. D. Davis.\u201d\u00a0It was around 4 a.m., Vach recalled, and within 20 minutes, his team had located the rabbi, who was not in the building at the time but told them he knew of a person in the building.\n  Vach said the rabbi had given the plaque as a gift to\u00a0Brad Cohen, who lived in unit 1110. &#34;So I know I am close to Brad,&#34; Vach said he thought at the time.\n On July 7, Vach found Cohen. He also found\u00a0Cohen\u2019s brother, Gary, who was visiting from out of town.\n \u201cYou see a lot of death,\u201d Vach said. \u201cSome do not look like\u00a0human beings. I tried to treat them as people, as souls. Treat them as if they were my parents.\u201d\n Still, the heartbreak of finding someone\u2019s loved one never gets easier, Vach said softly, and some of his team really struggled.\n \u201cI say to them, \u2018Hey, it&#39;s OK.\u00a0She was waiting for us for five days to be found. Treat her gently. Cover her with a blanket. One day, you will be the same,\u2019\u201d he said.\n   The harsh reality, said Maor Elbaz Starinsky, the consul general of Israel, is that the Israeli teams are so proficient at what they do because they have had so much opportunity to sharpen their skills.\n \u201cUnfortunately, we have a lot of experience with disasters,\u201d he said. \u201cIsraeli towns and cities and population centers have become the new front for the war zone in the Middle East. ...\n So our military and authorities have developed very advanced techniques that are useful in territories other than war zones.\u201d\n  While Starinsky already had 15 years&#39; experience in the foreign ministry, he was only four days into his new position as Israeli consul general in Miami when Champlain Towers South collapsed, he said in a telephone interview from his home in Israel.\n He said he had not been confirmed after initially accepting\u00a0the position months earlier because of turmoil in the Israeli government.\n  \u201cIt was a really bumpy start for this whole mission,\u201d he said, adding that the Israeli foreign minister immediately after the collapse instructed him to \u201cspare no effort\u201d in\u00a0assisting.\n \u201cFor us, the most natural thing still is, and forever will be, to offer our help to our biggest ally,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael will never have a better friend than the U.S., and the U.S. will never have a better ally or friend than Israel.\u201d\n   Starinsky said he provided his personal credit card to help\u00a0fill prescriptions and buy blankets, shoes and food for those who had survived the collapse but lost all of their possessions.\n His team also helped family members of the missing arrange travel from places such as Israel, Venezuela and Colombia, he said, and the Israeli Embassy in Washington helped them even further when they arrived in Miami.\n  &#34;This is not a Jewish tragedy, this is a human tragedy,\u00a0it\u2019s an international tragedy,&#34; he said.\n Starinsky said that while\u00a0U.S. forces vastly outnumber Israeli forces, Israeli forces have learned to do more with less.\n &#34;We have to be very, very wise and clever in the way we run our operations,&#34; he said. &#34;We have learned to be what we call &#39;small and swift.&#39;&#34;\n  U.S. and Israeli teams complemented one another\u00a0beautifully, he said, each drawing on their greatest strengths to do everything possible to rescue and recover victims from what he called a \u201cvery dramatic,\u201d \u201cviolent\u201d collapse.\n  And while some have questioned if more lives could have been saved if the IDF team had been brought in sooner, Starinsky is not so sure.\n \u201cMaybe, maybe, maybe,\u201d he said slowly, contemplating the question. \u201cIt took us a few days to prove our uniqueness, our efficiency; why it was worth schlepping us, commuting us, from halfway across the world to help the U.S.&#34;\n  Still, after thinking about it, he said he doesn&#39;t think it would have made much difference.\n \u201cProbably, because of the nature of this collapse, everybody died instantly or very close to instantly,\u201d he said. \u201cI&#39;m not sure if we had the coordination earlier it would change the result of this disaster.\u201d\n The primary reason for that, he said, was\u00a0the way the building collapsed was so unusual.\n \u201cIt was not like an earthquake or urban missiles when part of the building is broken or falls down and you have a lot of voids and holes and tunnels that are created,\u201d he said. \u201cThis building collapsed almost as if it was intended. When they  imploded the other part, it imploded in the perfect shape.\u201d\n Then, he paused for a moment, clearly shaken by the memory, before adding almost under his breath, \u201cIt&#39;s a terrible word to say, \u2018perfect.\u2019\u201d", "posttime": "2021-07-27 11:07:12", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

strain, but still provides strong protection against severe illness and hospitalization, according to a new report from the country&#39;s Health Ministry.\n The efficacy figure, which is based on an unspecified number of people between June 20 and July 17, is down from an earlier estimate of  64% two weeks ago and conflicts with data out of the U.K. that found the shot was 88% effective against symptomatic disease caused by the variant.\n  However, the two-dose vaccine still works very well in preventing people from getting seriously sick, demonstrating 88% effectiveness against hospitalization and 91% effectiveness against severe illness, according to the Israeli data published Thursday.\n &#34;We have to be mindful that, with time, the effectiveness of these vaccines may wane,&#34; said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease professor at the University of Toronto.\n  He stressed that the shots are still highly effective in preventing severe infection, helping hospital systems not get too overwhelmed heading into the colder months. That being said, &#34;we&#39;re still in the Covid era and anything can happen,&#34; he said.\n &#34;We have to be prepared and we have to be nimble that people may need a booster at some point,&#34; he added. &#34;This close surveillance that&#39;s happening in countries like Israel, the U.K. and other parts of the world is going to be very helpful in driving policy if and when we do need boosters.&#34;\n The delta variant, already in more than 104 countries, is concerning health officials in the U.S. as they see more breakthrough infections, which occur in fully vaccinated people, even though they are more mild.\n  White House chief medical officer Dr. Anthony Fauci said fully vaccinated people might want to consider wearing masks indoors as a precaution against the rapidly spreading variant in the U.S.\n Health experts are  concerned about the fall season, when delta is expected to hit states with the lowest vaccination rates the hardest \u2014 unless those states and businesses reintroduce mask rules, capacity limits and other public health measures that they&#39;ve largely rolled back.\n &#34;That&#39;s something we obviously don&#39;t want to see,&#34; Fauci  said Wednesday, noting the so-called breakthrough infections. &#34;This virus is clearly different than the viruses and the variants that we&#39;ve had experience with before. It has an extraordinary capability of transmitting from person to person.&#34;\n Dr. Paul Offit, who advises the FDA on Covid vaccines, said while the vaccines still provide excellent protection against severe disease and death, they may not work as well against mild cases or spreading the disease to others.\n He urged more Americans to get vaccinated, saying delta is a highly contagious virus and the shots will help people from getting seriously sick. Currently, less than half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by the CDC.\n &#34;That is a rich and fertile ground for the virus to continue to reproduce itself and continue to create variants that possibly become more and more resistant to vaccines or natural infection,&#34; he said.\n WHO officials said Monday that the longer that people around the world remain unvaccinated and social mixing continues, the higher the risk of a more dangerous variant to emerge.\n The report out of Israel, which began vaccinating its population ahead of many other countries, is likely to bolster arguments from drugmakers that people will eventually need to get booster shots to protect against emerging variants.\n Pfizer\u00a0 said earlier this month\u00a0it is starting to see waning immunity from its two-dose vaccine, and now plans to seek authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for a booster dose. However, federal officials say fully vaccinated Americans do not need additional shots at this time.\n In a statement to CNBC, Pfizer said it remains confident its two-dose regimen is protective against the coronavirus and its variants.\n Still, it said a third dose may be helpful after analysis from its phase three study showed a decline in efficacy against symptomatic infection after four to six months.\n &#34;Initial data of a third dose of the current vaccine demonstrates that a booster dose given at least 6 months after the second dose elicits high neutralization titers against the wild type and the Beta, which are 5 to 10 times higher than after two primary doses,&#34; the company said.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8868\u793a,delta,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u968f\u7740 delta \u7684\u8513\u5ef6\uff0c\u8f89\u745e Covid \u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ec5\u4e3a 39%", "title_en": "Israel says Pfizer Covid vaccine is just 39% effective as delta spreads", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/delta-variant-pfizer-covid-vaccine-39percent-effective-in-israel-prevents-severe-illness.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8868\u793a", "delta", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bbd39f0bd02aa4d69f7d73e84de2680a.jpg", "infoid": 1069944, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eba\u4eec\u62c5\u4efb\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u804c\u4f4d\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002", "note_en": "Stories of folks reaching Staff Engineer roles.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 11:06:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08,engineer,\u804c\u4f4d", "title": "\u53c2\u8c0b\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6307\u5357", "title_en": "Staff Engineer Guide", "transed": 1, "url": "https://staffeng.com/guides", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08", "engineer", "\u804c\u4f4d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1069943, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba Facebook \u5e10\u6237\u5df2\u88ab\u9519\u8bef\u505c\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728 FB \u5e02\u573a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u68cb\u76d8\u6e38\u620f\u7684 FB \u7fa4\u7ec4\u4e2d\u51fa\u552e\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u6e38\u620f\u201c\u79d8\u5bc6\u5e0c\u7279\u52d2\u201d\u7684\u526f\u672c\u3002\u6211\u731c FB \u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u68cb\u76d8\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u6807\u8bb0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7981\u7528\u4e86\u6211\u8fdd\u53cd\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5e10\u6237\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u770b\u51fa\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8fd9\u663e\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6211\u5bf9\u8be5\u51b3\u5b9a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u8bc9\u540e\uff0cFB \u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u6539\u53d8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bc9\u3002\u6211\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba FB \u5e10\u6237\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u6211\u7684 Oculus \u5e93\uff08\u6211\u65e0\u6cd5\u518d\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u7684 FB \u4e1a\u52a1\u9875\u9762\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u8352\u8c2c\u3002", "note_en": "My personal facebook account has been deactivated mistakenly because I attempted to sell my used copy of the board game &#34;Secret Hitler&#34; in FB marketplace, among other boardgame focused FB groups.

have on the Tesla Semi, which was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2017. Back in January, Musk said the engineering work on the Tesla Semi had been completed and  deliveries were expected to begin this year. He did add the caveat, at the time, that the availability of battery cells could limit the company\u2019s ability to produce the Semi.\n That warning was apparently warranted. From the shareholders\u2019 letter posted today after the market closed:\n  We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.\n To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.\n While not mentioned on the call or in its earnings report, the delay follows the departure of Jerome Guillen, a critical executive at Tesla who was working on the development and eventual production of the Tesla Semi. Guillen\u2019s resignation in June came just three months after he was moved from the president of automotive position, which included oversight of the Tesla Semi, to a role with less responsibility as head of heavy-duty trucking. Guillen had led Tesla\u2019s entire automotive business from September 2018 until March 2021.\n Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, which is supposed to go into production in late 2021, looks like it might be pushed into next year as well. Musk didn\u2019t answer questions, but comments from Musk as well as Tesla VP of engineering Lars Moravy during the earnings call suggest that it could shift to 2022.\n Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages of prototyping, with the basic engineering and architecture of the vehicle completed. While the Model Y takes priority, the company is moving into a beta phase of the Cybertruck later this year, Moravy said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to ramp that in production in Texas after Model Y is up and going,\u201d he added.\n Musk leaned in on how difficult the Cybertruck would be, perhaps as a way to cushion expectations for its arrival in 2021.\n \u201cCybertruck ramp will be difficult because it is such a new architecture,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great product; it might be our best product ever, but it does have a lot of fundamentally new design ideas.\u201d\n He went on to make the point that he has used as other vehicles have gone from prototype to volume production: Manufacturing is hard.\n \u201cAt the risk of being repetitive, it\u2019s actually easy to make prototypes or a handful of small-volume production, but anything produced at a high volume, which is really what\u2019s relevant here, is it\u2019s going to move as fast as the slowest of the rough order of magnitude of 10,000 unique parts and processes.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-07-27 10:27:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u5361\u8f66,burnered,\u9a6c\u65af\u514b", "title": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u5c06\u534a\u6302\u5361\u8f66\u63a8\u8fdf\u5230 2022 \u5e74\uff1b Cyber\u200b\u200btruck \u4e3a Model Y \u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTesla delays Semi truck to 2022; Cybertruck back-burnered for Model Y\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7279\u65af\u62c9", "\u5361\u8f66", "burnered", "\u9a6c\u65af\u514b"]}]
