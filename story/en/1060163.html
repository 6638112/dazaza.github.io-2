Some have water. Some are just open void and darkness. The most important thing one might ask about a hole is how deep it is. When we can’t readily discern the depth, the hole begets additional legendary characteristics.</p><p>地面上有无数洞。有些人有水。有些只是打开空虚和黑暗。最重要的事情可能会询问一个洞是多么深。当我们无法轻易辨别深度时，孔会导致额外的传奇特征。</p><p>  The dark hole is universally scary. Whatever is down there is unknown but undoubtedly unpleasant. The light cannot penetrate far into the gloom so the bottom can’t be seen. Thus, people assume it has no bottom at all. Objects thrown into the hole aren’t recovered. The listener may hear no splash or crack of a stone hitting some surface below. As a folklore motif, the unfathomable hole is ancient. There are countless tales of bottomless lakes, pools, and bogs. These water bodies claim people (dead or alive), animals, treasure, transport vehicles, and many secrets. Like quicksand,  the bottomless pit has also become a media horror trope. If you don’t die from the sheer bottomlessness of it all, you will encounter whatever nasty thing exists in the dark, forsaken void.</p><p>  暗洞普遍吓人。无论是什么都是未知，但无疑不愉快。光不能渗透到阴霾中，所以无法看到底部。因此，人们认为它根本没有底部。抛入孔中的物体没有恢复。听众可以听到击中下面一些表面的石头的飞溅或裂缝。作为民间传说主题，无法实现的洞是古老的。有无底湖泊，池和沼泽的无数故事。这些水体要求人员（死亡或活着），动物，宝藏，运输车辆和许多秘密。像Quicksand一样，无底坑也成为媒体恐怖拖把。如果你没有死于这一切的纯粹无底调性，你会遇到黑暗中存在的任何令人讨厌的东西，以夸张无效。</p><p> They are used as a handy disposal method, a perfect death trap, and sometimes, for the villain’s demise in a dramatic last scene. It’s impossible to discuss the bottomless pit or pool without its connection to hell. To fall into the “pit” is symbolic of the descent into hell and damnation.</p><p> 它们被用作方便的处置方法，一个完美的死亡陷阱，有时候，在恶意的最后一个场景中为恶棍的消亡。没有与地狱的连接，讨论无底洞或池是不可能的。陷入“坑”是象征着地狱和诅咒的象征。</p><p> Therefore, it might not be surprising to discover how often legendary bottomless holes have a demonstrated bottom that people simply chose to ignore. Having a bottom doesn’t necessarily make it less dangerous or negate its evil reputation that is mythologized via various themes. In this feature, I explore these folklore themes utilized widely for local holes, pools and lakes to mark their cultural significance. And, I try to connect them to their geological foundations.</p><p> 因此，发现传奇无底洞有一个展示的底部的漏洞可能是令人惊讶的，这可能并不令人惊讶的是，人们只是选择忽视的底部。底部不一定使其不那么危险或否定其通过各种主题是神话的邪恶声誉。在此功能中，我探索了这些民间传说主题，广泛用于当地洞，游泳池和湖泊，以标志着他们的文化意义。而且，我试图将它们连接到他们的地质基础。</p><p>  In a practical sense, bottomless simply means someone tried to detect the bottom and couldn’t. Naturally, locals would be concerned about the depth of an open hole or pool that they might fall into. They would logically attempt to plumb it with an available oar or long tree branch or sapling. Others will try a weighted line. If those methods fail, then, seemingly by default, the opening is declared “bottomless”. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of openings and water bodies were said at one time or another to be “bottomless”. Legends live on even into modern times.</p><p>  在实际意义上，底层只是意味着有人试图检测到底部，不能。当然，当地人将关注他们可能落入的开放孔或池的深度。他们会逻辑地尝试用可用的桨或长树枝或树苗拆除它。其他人会尝试加权线。如果这些方法失败，那么，似乎默认情况下，开口被声明为“无底”。百分之一，也许有数千个开口和水体被一次或另一个是“无底”。传说甚至进入近代。</p><p>  The bottomless pit is  a well-known supernatural trope that frequently includes additional features such as having bizarre inhabitants, emitting strange sounds, or having supernatural properties.</p><p>  无底坑是一种众所周知的超自然轨迹，通常包括具有奇异居民的附加特征，例如具有奇异的声音，或具有超自然性质。</p><p> William Corliss, a collector of anomalies wrote that the accounts of such pits “smack of sensationalism and must be taken with several grains of salt”. Mike Dash suggests that the widespread legend of bottomless holes and lakes was an indicator of “the limits of geographical mobility a century or more ago”. That is, people didn’t travel so their yardstick for a big hole was that one in their vicinity. Some water bodies eventually have dried up enough to lose the mystique.</p><p> William Corliss，一个异常的收藏家写道，这种坑的账户“轰动耸人听闻，并且必须用几粒盐拍摄”。 Mike Dash表明，无底洞和湖泊的广泛传说是“一个世纪以来几世纪或更多世纪的地理活动限制”的指标。也就是说，人们没有旅行，所以他们的尺度为一个大洞是一个在他们附近。一些水体最终已经干得足以失去神秘主义者。 </p><p> More creatively, some people thought that a water body without a discernible depth had at on its floor an outlet or tunnel to another water body, sometimes hundreds of miles away. Even if a lake had a measured floor, it was common to see mentioned a cave passage that existed somewhere within the perimeter that was where the true danger or mystery was. Swimmers were warned that an icy cold swell or sucking whirlpool would imperil them.</p><p>更有创造性地，有些人认为没有可辨别深度的水体在其地板上出口或隧道到另一个水体，有时距离数百英里之外。即使湖泊有一个测量的地板，也很常见，看看洞穴通道，这些洞穴是在周边内存在的某个地方，这是真正的危险或神秘的地方。游泳者被警告说，冰冷的冷膨胀或吸吮漩涡会威胁。</p><p>  The term “bottomless” has been applied to open dry holes, and water-filled depressions like lakes, ponds, pools, or bogs. There must be thousands of examples of features around the world that have been at one time called “bottomless”. Their geological origins are diverse.</p><p>  术语“无底”已被应用于打开干燥孔，并像湖泊，池塘，池或沼泽一样的充满水洼地。在世界各地的世界各地必须有成千上万的例子被称为“无底”。他们的地质起源是多元化的。</p><p> Mammoth cave in Kentucky has a “bottomless pit” that is 105 feet deep. It can be difficult to measure a true “bottom” if a cavern extends into a deeper karst system. Some caves or shafts are rumored to drop off into a huge cavern. That is usually more fiction than reality.</p><p> 肯塔基州的猛犸洞有一个“无底坑”，深度105英尺。如果洞穴延伸到更深的岩溶系统中，则可能难以测量真正的“底部”。一些洞穴或轴被传闻进入一个巨大的洞穴。这通常比现实更多的虚构。</p><p> The  Dozmary Pool in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall was said to have an outlet to the sea which was 10.5 miles (16.9 km) away. Dozmary Pool is important for migrating birds, native rare plants, and for its preservation of vegetation since the last ice age. But it was also claimed to possibly be the location where the legendary King Arthur received the sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake. Several other tales are also associated with the pool including that it was the source of the winds on the moor.  The lake dried up in 1866 and again in 1869 and 1976 proving that it was not bottomless but subject to drought conditions.</p><p> 德国在博德姆沼床上的枣泳池据说距离大海有一个出口，距离酒店有10.5英里（16.9公里）。 Dozmary游泳池对于迁移鸟类，本土稀有植物以及自上次冰河时期以来的保存是重要的。但它也是可能是传奇国王亚瑟从湖的女士接受剑的位置。其他几个故事也与游泳池有关，包括它是沼地上风的源泉。湖泊于1866年枯竭，并于1869年和1976年再次证明它不是无底，但受干旱条件。</p><p> Vouliagmeni is a lake in Greece that was said to suck people in via a whirlpool, or they could be nabbed by the evil fairy folk living at the bottom. The lake had formed from a cavern roof collapse after an earthquake some 2000 years ago. No one had managed to sound the bottom because it was part of an extensive cave system that continued under the mountain. Some people trying to explore the underwater caves have perished. It’s possible that a strong current might have existed underwater at times, creating a visible swirling effect.</p><p> Vouliagmeni是希腊的一个湖，据说通过漩涡吮吸人们，或者他们可以被居住在底部的邪恶神仙的民间抓住。湖已经从2000年前发生了大地震后的洞穴屋顶塌陷。没有人成功地听起来是底部的，因为它是一个在山上继续下面的广泛洞穴系统的一部分。有些人试图探索水下洞穴已经消失了。有可能在水下可能存在强劲的电流，产生可见的旋转效果。</p><p> As with some of the “bottomless lakes” waterless chasms are often karst-related sinkholes or caves.  Flagstaff, Arizona’s Bottomless Pit is a karst feature. As with many sinkholes, it connects to and drains into the underground openings. Filling a sinkhole often doesn’t work because the fill material collapses into a bigger opening. When the hole gets blocked it may temporarily hold water until the plug comes loose and the hole drains. There are many legends around this Flagstaff pit and it was once somewhat of a tourist attraction.</p><p> 与某些“无底湖泊”的无水雪橇一样，通常是岩溶相关的下沉或洞穴。 Flagstaff，亚利桑那州的无底坑是岩溶特色。与许多污水孔一样，它连接到地下开口。填充污水常常不起作用，因为填充材料倒入更大的开口。当孔阻塞时，它可能暂时保持水，直到插头松动，孔排水管。这个旗子坑周围有很多传说，它曾经有些旅游景点。</p><p> Bottomless Lakes State Park in New Mexico is over 1600 acres of land with eight lakes available to visitors. They acquired their name when local herdsmen could not discern the bottom via ropes. The green-blue color from algae makes the pools look tranquil and ultra-deep. Bottomless Lakes are the result of karst features, sinkholes that are perpetually filled with water because they extend below the water table. These features are called cenotes and are not uncommon. The legend of the lakes includes the idea that the lakes are connected to each other and to Carlsbad Caverns (90 miles away) or the Gulf of Mexico (600 miles away) through subterranean passages. While this is not technically impossible for water pathway via a regional aquifer, it is NOT remotely plausible for objects of any size, like an animal or person. Again, we see the idea of a “sucking” current that could capture swimmers. The Bottomless Lakes has resident monsters described as giant turtles.</p><p> 新墨西哥的无底湖州立公园拥有1600英亩的土地，可供游客使用8张湖泊。当当地牧民无法通过绳索辨别底部时，他们获得了名字。来自藻类的绿色蓝色使游泳池看起来宁静和超深。无底湖是喀斯特特征的结果，下沉孔，永久填充水，因为它们延伸在水上台下方。这些功能称为CENotes，并不罕见。湖的传说包括湖泊彼此相互连接的想法，并通过地下段落到墨西哥湾（600英里外）或墨西哥湾（600英里远）。虽然通过区域含水层在技术上不可能过于技术上，但对于任何尺寸的物体，就像动物或人一样，它并不可怜。再次，我们看到了可以捕获游泳者的“吸吮”目前的想法。无底湖泊有居民怪物被描述为巨龟。 </p><p>   Marie Bonaparte noted the idea of “unfathomable” was applied to still waters, not the ocean or rivers. The ocean, while clearly deeper, at least moved, ebbed, and flowed. Rivers also were moving and occasionally revealed their bottoms. But stagnant waters made us uneasy with their silence. She noted a correspondent told her of Welsh legends where the lakes had their own personalities and resented being measured.</p><p>Marie Bonaparte注意到“不可思议”的想法是应用于仍然的水域，而不是海洋或河流。海洋，虽然显然更深，至少移动，燃烧和流动。河流也在移动，偶尔会揭示他们的底部。但是沉默的水域停滞不前。她注意到一位记者告诉她威尔士队的传说，湖泊有自己的个性并被衡量。</p><p> The legend of Bale Lake in Wales tells of the voice of the lake crying out “Line cannot fathom me. Go, or I will swallow you up” and no one tried since. Bale Lake was also rumored to hold a dragon.</p><p> 威尔士贝尔湖的传说讲述了湖的声音哭泣“线路不能欺骗我。去，或者我会吞下你“，没有人尝试过。贝尔湖也被传闻举行龙。</p><p>  Michel Meurger wrote about the tradition of lake monsters in Europe and North America. Two qualities of a lake indicated the almost certain presence of a legendary monster – first, dark water, and secondly, it was deemed unfathomable. If bottomless represented the unknown, it’s a very small leap of thought to assume there were monsters in this abyss. We find many legends of bottomless lakes associated with a resident monster.</p><p>  Michel Meureger撰写了关于欧洲和北美湖的传统。湖的两个品质表明了传奇怪物的几乎某些存在 - 第一，黑水，其次，它被视为不可思议。如果无底代表未知，这是一个非常小的飞跃，以假设在这种深渊中有怪物。我们找到许多与居民怪物相关的无底湖的传说。</p><p> The bay of Djibouti Devil’s Island (East Africa) is supposedly the home of a sea monster or “sheytan”. There is a story that famous undersea explorer  Jacques Cousteau saw it and never told anyone additional details. This is entirely unsubstantiated, and the bay is not bottomless but has a strong current that may have prevented accurate line measurements.</p><p> 吉布提魔鬼岛（东非）湾据说是海怪的家或“Sheytan”。有一个故事，着名的Undersea Explorer Jacques Cousteau看到它，从未告诉过任何额外的细节。这完全是未经证实的，海湾不是无底，但具有强大的电流可能会阻止准确的线路测量。</p><p>  There are scores of examples of lakes in particular that, instead of a bottom, they have a monster. Glacial lakes can be particularly steep-sided and deep. The lakes of the Great Glen in Scotland are notable: Loch Ness has dark, peat-stained water as well. A depth of 745 feet is seriously impressive. Storytellers supposed that the loch bottom had hidden caverns that connected to the ocean to the northeast thus providing a passage for one of the world’s most famous lake monsters. Loch Morar, southwest of Ness, reaches 1017 feet.  It also has a monster legend.</p><p>  特别是湖泊的比例，而不是底部，他们有一个怪物。冰川湖泊可以特别陡峭，深。苏格兰的伟大格伦的湖泊是值得注意的：Loch ness有黑暗，泥炭染色的水。深度为745英尺严重令人印象深刻。讲故事者认为，湖底部有隐藏的洞穴，这些洞穴与东北连接到海洋，从而为世界上最着名的湖门之一提供了一段经文。 Loch Morar，Ness西南，达到1017英尺。它也有一个怪物传说。</p><p> The characteristic of “bottomless” is associated with the idea that a lake does not “give up its dead”. This is suggestive of some evil entity or the lake itself as a living thing that takes sacrifices.</p><p> “无底”的特征与湖泊不“放弃死亡”的想法有关。这暗示了一些邪恶的实体或湖泊本身作为一种牺牲的生物。</p><p>  Lake Dulyn in Snowdonia, North Wales was commonly regarded not that many decades ago as a dangerous “bottomless” hole where evil creatures would reach up from the abyss and engulf people. There were many superstitions associated with the lake bolstered by real airplane crashes. The glacial  cirque “black lake” bottoms out at about 190 feet (58 m). In   The Mabinogion, translated by Lady Charlotte Guest [1877] it was said that fish in the lake are deformed and odd and that birds do not visit it. This is likely not true as  brown trout and char live in the lake. Lake birds may not be common because of the high cliffs surrounding the water making the lake feel very enclosed and isolated.</p><p>  北威尔士州斯诺尼亚湖（北威尔士）通常认为这不是一个危险的“无底”洞，那里邪恶的生物将从深渊和吞噬人民伸出困境。与真正的飞机撞车队突然化的湖有许多迷信。冰川致力量“黑湖”底部大约190英尺（58米）。在Mabinogion中，由夏洛特夫人翻译[1877]据说湖中的鱼变形，奇怪的是，鸟儿不去参观。这可能不是真实的，因为棕色鳟鱼和克里斯特在湖中。由于围绕水的高悬崖，湖鸟可能不常见，使湖泊感到非常封闭和隔离。 </p><p> Knucker or knacker holes are “bottomless” ponds that do not freeze or dry up. The term is used primarily in Europe. These legendary spots might hold healing waters or a dragon. The name comes from the old Saxon word “nicor” meaning water spirit or monster. It’s not clear if the knuckers made the holes or just found them convenient to occupy. They can be dangerous as the water is constantly cold and the sides may be steep making it hard to climb out. A knucker hole in Burgess’s Field, Binstead, Sussex, England was once pumped dry. The men saw the muddy bottom but simply assumed the monster was hiding under the mud. Water kept flowing in. Knucker holes are springs. They are usually around 20 feet across and remain at the same level suggesting a large or distant recharge area. There are famous knuckerholes at Lyminster, Lancing, Shoreham, Worthing, and other areas of the South Downs that are flat.  In Sompting, local lore of the 1940s described a very dangerous bottomless hole that swallowed a cart — horse and all. Madonna pond was said to be haunted by the coach and horse that fell in, never to be retrieved. In Lyminster, people tried to find the bottom of the local hole by tying the six bell ropes of the church together. No luck. Divers eventually discovered it was about 30 feet deep but that didn’t squelch the more impressive rumor. It’s likely that attempting to feel the bottom fails because of either the upwelling water or the soft mud floor.</p><p>knucker或knacker孔是不冻结或晾干的“无底”池塘。该术语主要用于欧洲。这些传奇斑点可能会举行治疗水域或龙。这个名字来自旧的撒克逊词语“裸体”意味着水精或怪物。如果指向节目洞或刚刚发现它们占用，则目前尚不清楚。它们可能是危险的，因为水不断冷，两侧可能陡峭，使其难以爬出。在Burgess领域的一孔洞，英国苏斯凯克，苏塞克斯，曾经抽了干燥。男人看到泥泞的底部，但只是假设怪物躲在泥土下。水一直流入。knucker孔是弹簧。它们通常大约20英尺，并留在相同的水平，表明大型或遥远的充电区域。 Lyminster，血轮，岸边，胜利等南下游的着名Knuckersess，以及平坦的南下游。在挪威化的情况下，20世纪40年代的当地洛尔描述了一个非常危险的无底洞，吞下了一辆车 - 马和所有人。据说麦当娜池塘被落在的教练和马困扰，从来没有被检索。在Lyminster中，人们试图通过将教堂的六个钟绳捆绑在一起，找到当地洞的底部。没有运气。潜水员最终发现它大约30英尺深，但没有施加更令人印象深刻的谣言。由于升高的水或软泥地板，可能试图感受到底部失败。</p><p> Lake Ronkonkoma is Long Island’s biggest and deepest lake. Natives thought the lake was bottomless because the bodies of those who drowned were not always recovered. Even though the lake is only at most 70 ft deep,  this myth persists. Again, the lack of visibility in the lake is such that a person submerged 10 feet or more disappears from the view of the surface observer.</p><p> Ronkonkoma湖是长岛最大，最深层的湖泊。当地人认为湖泊无底，因为淹死的人的身体并不总是康复。即使湖泊只有70英尺深，这个神话仍然存在。同样，湖泊中缺乏可见性使得从表面观察者的视图中浸没10英尺或更长的人消失。</p><p> The “Dinglehole” is a tiny pond in Millis, MA, that also holds the “bottomless” attribution. Here, more surface occult activity supposedly occurs as this place is  where the devil meets with his minions and a headless ghost circles the pond after being summoned by hobgoblins.</p><p> “Dinglehole”是MA，MA的一个小池塘，也拥有“无底”的归属。在这里，更多的表面神秘的活动据说是这样的，因为这个地方是魔鬼与他的仆从和无头幽灵圈出来的池塘后，在被Hobgoblins召唤后圈子。</p><p>  The unfathomable  Mummelsee, in the northern Black Forest, Baden Baden, Germany was called the Lake of Miracles by the Romans. It supposedly would reject fish by throwing them out again. The lake has high peat content turning the water black and the pH to around 5, so it’s too low for fish. Any fish placed in it might have simply leaped out. The most famous legend was that of the King of the lake and his mermaid nymphs that lived there. The cirque lake, formed by glaciers, is a popular tourist location.</p><p>  在德国巴登巴登的北黑森林中，德国北部的黑森林梅梅赛被称为罗比斯湖。它据说它会通过再次扔掉来拒绝鱼。湖泊有高泥炭含量，将水黑色和pH值转到大约5左右，所以鱼太低了。任何放置在它的鱼可能只是跳出来。最着名的传说是湖之王和他生活在那里的美人鱼若虫。由冰川形成的Cirque Lake是一个受欢迎的旅游地点。</p><p> Groundwater can be found typically within 300 feet of the ground surface. So, holes that deep will often collect water. The water conceals the ultimate depth. In 1901, English Mechanic magazine reported on a seemingly bottomless hole at 171 st St in New York City. The rumor was that the natives called the seemingly shallow pond the “black swamp” and considered it the home of evil spirits. Attempts to fill the hole failed. Earth was dumped into it with no effect. Animals were lost in it. It was filled only to be restored to its original condition the next day. It’s highly likely this was a glacial feature but without a detailed location, I can’t tell. The city is surrounded by water and before the 20 th century, the northern portions were undeveloped. I wish I had more info on this citation from Corliss.</p><p> 地下水通常可以在地面300英尺内找到。因此，深深的洞通常会收集水。水隐藏了最终的深度。 1901年，英国机械师杂志在纽约市的171号圣路易斯看似无底洞上报道。谣言是当地人称看起来看似浅的池塘“黑色沼泽”并认为它是邪恶的烈酒之家。试图填补洞失败了。地球倾倒在没有影响。动物丢失了。它被填补了第二天恢复到其原始条件。这很可能这是一个冰川特征，但没有详细的位置，我无法讲述。这座城市被水包围，在20世纪20世纪之前，北方部分未开发。我希望我有更多关于Corliss的引用的信息。</p><p>  A movie/TV trope that creates sudden “bottomless” chasms as a handy dramatic device is that of earth fissures that suddenly open during a quake  where living things and buildings slip in and are forever lost. Earthquakes don’t open  giant cracks miles deep or with lava pools. Any fissures or small hole on the surface can look deceptively deep because a narrow space does not allow light to penetrate far, so it looks scary.</p><p>  电影/电视轨迹突然创造突然的“无底”追逐作为一种方便的戏剧性设备，是在突然开放的地震中突然打开的地球裂缝，在那里生活的东西和建筑物的碎片，永远丧失。地震不会打开巨型裂缝，深层或熔岩池。表面上的任何裂缝或小孔都可以深入深入，因为狭窄的空间不允许光线渗透，所以它看起来很可怕。</p><p>  The earth occasionally does open up dramatically such as when huge sinkholes collapse. Craters forming in Siberia, in particular, look very much like a bottomless hole. The first of these craters were discovered in July 2014. The current explanation is that they are formed from the  collapse of previously frozen ground. This melting of permafrost forms what’s called  thermokarst. No one has seen one of these big craters form so it’s not clear if it happens explosively or gradually. The holes may also release a large volume of methane gas suddenly.</p><p>  地球偶尔会显着开放，例如巨大的下沉孔塌陷。在西伯利亚形成的陨石坑，特别是看起来非常像一个无底洞。这些陨石坑中的第一个被发现于2014年7月。目前的解释是，它们是由先前冻土的崩溃形成的。这种融化的永久冻土形成了所谓的Thermokarst。没有人看到这些大陨石坑中的一个形式，所以如果它爆炸性或逐渐发生，那就不清楚。孔还可突然释放大量的甲烷气体。 </p><p> Haleakala volcano in Hawaii has its own Bottomless Pit. This is ten-foot-wide opening rimmed with splatter from lava. It’s a dangerous feature. No bottom can be seen but there is debris that chokes the hole about 65 feet down. Gases were once emitted from this vent during past eruptions.  There was a legend here that parents disposed of their babies’ umbilical cords in this vent as a magical ritual to give the child positive qualities. Volcanic crater lakes often have the folkloric feature of being bottomless.</p><p>夏威夷的Haleakala火山有自己的无底坑。这是十英尺宽的开口，从熔岩与飞溅物。这是一个危险的特色。没有底部可以看出，但有碎屑扼杀孔约65英尺。在过去的爆发期间，气体曾经从此发泄。这里有一个传奇，父母在这个通风口中处理了他们的婴儿的脐带作为一种神奇的仪式来给孩子积极的品质。火山岩火山口湖泊经常具有无底的民俗特征。</p><p> Kettles or kettle holes are glacial features that seem out of place and are fodder for legends. The Spruce Hole in New Hampshire is an ice age bog now recognized as unique by the National Park Service as a Natural Landmark. It was described in 1888 as a bowl-shaped feature with a dark pool in the center “said to be unfathomable”. There was  a gruesome legend where a father killed his son and then also drowning himself. Supposedly, the bodies were never recovered. Soundings in 1896 found a bottom just 20 feet below, but the legend of the pool as supernaturally deep continued. Facts can’t ruin a good story.</p><p> 水壶或水壶孔是冰川特征，似乎不合适，并且是传说的饲料。新罕布什尔州的云杉洞是一个冰河时代沼泽，现在被国家公园服务作为自然地标。它在1888年描述为一个碗状的特征，中间的黑暗游泳池“据说是不可思议的”。有一个令人难以置信的传说，父亲杀死了他的儿子，然后也淹死了自己。据说，身体从未恢复过。 1896年的探测发现底部仅为20英尺以下，但游泳池的传奇作为超自然的深度持续。事实不能破坏一个好故事。</p><p> Even Thoreau’s famous Walden Pond was rumored to be bottomless. He recognized the rumor as a folklore motif common in New England. He succeeded in measuring the depth himself at 102 feet. The locals ignored the finding.</p><p> 甚至梭罗着名的沃尔登池塘都传闻了无底。他认为谣言是在新英格兰常见的民间传说主题。他成功地测量了102英尺的深度。当地人忽略了发现。</p><p> Montezuma well in McGuireville Arizona is a collapsed carbonate pool 368 feet wide and 55 feet deep. In the early 1900s, the bottom was not accessible for measurement so it was commonly said to be bottomless.</p><p> Montezuma在McGuireville亚利桑那州是一个倒塌的碳酸盐池368英尺，深5英尺。在20世纪初，底部无法接近测量，因此常常据说是无底的。</p><p> Thor’s well is a spectacular feature along the Oregon coal near Yachats. The  seemingly bottomless hole swallows all the seawater that flows in, appearing to drain the ocean! It’s only about 20 feet deep, the water is recirculated.</p><p> Thor井是俄勒冈州附近的俄勒冈煤层的壮观特色。看似无底洞的洞吞下了流入的所有海水，出现在海洋中出现！它厚约20英尺，水再循环。</p><p>  The term “blue hole” has been used to describe seemingly bottomless features of two types. First, a less formal connotation is used to describe a deep pond that seems out of place in the wildlands of southern New Jersey. And the second type are tropical karst features initially identified in the Bahamas.</p><p>  术语“蓝洞”已被用来描述两种类型的看似无底的特征。首先，使用较少的形式的内涵来描述似乎在南方南部南部的地方似乎不合适的深池。第二种类型是在巴哈马最初识别的热带岩溶特征。</p><p>  The most  famous “blue hole” of New Jersey is in Winslow, one of many pools that appear in the sandy Pine Barrens coastal plains.  The Blue Hole has dark water and is said to be bottomless. Tales are told of swimmers pulled to their doom by whirlpools or some other underwater force. Quicksand is also an occasional hazard here. Its presence suggests the explanation for the pools –  they are upwelling springs that emit cold water but never freeze. In the summer, the cold water under the warm surface can shock swimmers. Due to groundwater extraction, these spring-fed pools may eventually shrink or dry up.</p><p>  新泽西州最着名的“蓝洞”位于Winslow，其中许多游泳池之一出现在沙质松树荒谬的沿海平原上。蓝洞有黑水，据说是无底的。故事被告知游泳运动员通过漩涡或其他一些水下武​​力拉到他们的厄运。 Quicksand也是这里偶尔的危险。它的存在表明池的解释 - 它们是升空的弹簧，散发冷水，但永不冻结。在夏天，温暖的表面下的冷水可以震动游泳运动员。由于地下水提取，这些弹簧饲料池最终可能会缩小或干燥。 </p><p>  Blue holes in a more geological context are karst features documented for over 100 years. They are named for the deep blue color and their depth may actually be difficult to discern as they are connected to carbonate solution cavities and fissures that extend below sea level.  Formed during times when sea level lower, they were then flooded and may be isolated in inland areas or open to the existing marine environment. Divers enjoy exploring the blue holes but, as with any cave system, underwater caving can be treacherous.  Hydrogen sulfide gas in the water is toxic and can cause dizziness and nausea, disorienting divers. The danger is personified in a monster called the Lusca, a shark-headed creature with an octopus body who was said to live in the deep blue holes.</p><p>在更多地质背景下的蓝孔是喀斯特特征，已记录超过100年。它们被命名为深蓝色，它们的深度实际上可能难以辨别，因为它们与碳酸盐溶液腔内和裂缝延伸到海平面下方。在海平面下降时形成，然后淹没，并且可能在内陆地区隔离或向现有海洋环境开放。潜水员享受探索蓝洞，但与任何洞穴系统一样，水下洞穴可能是危险的。水中的硫化氢气体有毒，可引起头晕和恶心，迷失方向潜水员。危险是在一个叫做LUSCA的怪物中的怪物，一个鲨鱼头生物，曾经曾被召开的章鱼身体居住在深蓝色的洞中。</p><p>   It’s impossible to discuss bottomless pits without invoking the idea of gates to hell.</p><p>   在没有调用大门的想法到地狱，不可能讨论无底的坑。</p><p> The “bottomless pit” or abyss is mentioned in Revelation 9 in the Bible. It’s the freeway to hell at the center of the earth. In Revelation 20, an angel throws Satan or the devil in the form of a serpent or dragon back into the pit and seals it.</p><p> 在圣经中的启示录9中提到了“无底坑”或深渊。这是地球中心地狱的高速公路。在启示录20中，天使将撒旦或魔鬼以蛇或龙的形式扔回坑中并密封它。</p><p>  The  Youdig marshland of Yeun Elez in Brittany, France is loaded with legends and lore as a bottomless bog. It is said to be an entrance to hell that swallows damned souls. Priests were said to send the demons from exorcisms into black dogs which were subsequently drowned in the bog. Crossing the bog is dangerous as dry land can suddenly turn liquid. The Youdig also was home to ghost lights that may be a result of an unknown reaction of swamp gases, though locals thought of them as spirits or fairies that lured people to their doom. Gas release may also account for the tales of the swamp boiling and bubbling.</p><p>  法国布列塔尼的Yeun Elez的Youdig沼泽地被称为传说和疏远的沼泽。据说是吞下诅咒灵魂的地狱的入口。据说牧师将恶魔从驱魔中送入黑狗，随后被淹死在沼泽中。横穿沼泽是危险的，因为旱地可以突然变动液体。 Youdig也是鬼灯的家，可能是沼泽气体未知反应的结果，尽管当地人认为它们是诱导人们灭亡的烈酒或仙女。气体释放也可能考虑沼泽沸腾和鼓泡的故事。</p><p>  There are several examples of holes being associated with both the devil and the appearance of being bottomless. The best example would be Devil’s Hole in Death Valley that claimed the lives of two boys in 1965 and inspired Charles Manson. For more on that location, see a previous feature  here.</p><p>  有几个与魔鬼相关的孔的例子和无底的外观。最好的例子是魔鬼在死亡谷的洞，声称了1965年的两个男孩的生命，并激发了查尔斯曼森的灵感。有关该位置的更多，请参阅此处的先前功能。</p><p> The famous  “well to hell” hoax came with a soundtrack of voices of the damned. Workers on a drilling project in an unnamed place in Siberia sunk a hole 14.4 kilometers (8.9 mi) deep before breaking through to a cavity from which they heard and recorded screaming voices and measured searing heat. The story was first published in Finland by a Pentecostal Christian journal. In 1989, religious network Trinity Broadcasting (TBN) reported the story framed as “Scientists Discover Hell”. In 1990,  Rich Buhler, a radio host for Christianity Today, tracked the story back to the propaganda article that was based on a made-up story. The audio tape of the voices may have come from a horror movie.</p><p> 着名的“良好的地狱”骗局来了一个诅咒声音的配音。在西伯利亚的一个未命名的地方钻探项目的工人沉没一个洞14.4公里（8.9英里），然后突破一个洞穴，他们听到并记录尖叫声并测量灼热的热量。这个故事是由五旬节基督教学报在芬兰发表的。 1989年，宗教网络三位一体广播（TBN）报告了这个故事被诬陷为“科学家发现地狱”。 1990年，当今基督教的无线电主人Rich Buhler追踪了这个故事回到了基于制定故事的宣传文章。声音磁带可能来自恐怖电影。</p><p> A famous bottomless pit that was said to have released demons and monsters was situated beneath Houska Castle in the Czech Republic. The castle was supposedly constructed in the middle 13th century to surround and cover the hole to hell that had spontaneously formed. Spirits and beasts from the underworld escaped to torment the locals. Of geological interest, the area here is limestone so we could speculate that a natural karst feature was the inspiration for the hole. Prisoners were put into the hole and were pr</p><p> 着名的无底坑，据说释放了释放的恶魔，怪物位于捷克共和国的Houska城堡下方。这座城堡据说是在13世纪中间的建造，围绕着洞穴到了自发地形成的地狱。来自黑社会的烈酒和野兽逃脱了折磨当地人。地质兴趣，这里的区域是石灰石所以我们可以推出一种自然的喀斯特特征是洞的灵感。囚犯被放入洞，是公关 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://spookygeology.com/legends-and-science-of-bottomless-pits-bogs-and-lakes/">https://spookygeology.com/legends-and-science-of-bottomless-pits-bogs-and-lakes/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/传说/">#传说</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/science/">#science</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
