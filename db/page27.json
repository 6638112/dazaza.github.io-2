However, unlike ClassPass\u2019 BTC model, Gympass partners with employers who then pay a flat fee for the platform (an app) which then allows their employees to choose from several wellbeing plans that give them access to myriad in-person gyms and studios, and a directory of health apps, such as Calm. The offerings are broken up into the following categories: physical health, emotional health, nutrition and sleep.\n According to the company, in May, Gympass saw a record 4 million monthly check-ins across its network of more than 50,000 global partners. In fact, for some of the partners, usage hit above pre-COVID levels.\n  Between increased anxiety rates and documented weight gain during the pandemic, it\u2019s clear that people are eager to get active again with the hopes of improving their mental health and their waistlines.\n GymPass is the brainchild of Cesar Carvalho, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant in Brazil who was always on the road and yearned for a corporate wellness product that would comply with his hectic work schedule.\n  \u201cSome days I worked from home, other days I worked from the office, and then there was the time I was traveling. I could never go to the gym in one place,\u201d Carvalho told TechCrunch. \u201cI realized that my needs were the same as others,\u201d he said.\n  \u201cI\u2019m one of those crazy entrepreneurs that drops out of their MBA to start a company, but looking back now, it worked out okay,\u201d he said, later telling TechCrunch that Gympass is now in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the U.K.\n Since its launch in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2012, the company achieved product-market fit fairly quickly, and its growth and expansion have been largely organic.\n Originally, Gympass was a BTC concept, and one of its first clients was an executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Brazil. He liked the product so much that he eventually said to Carvalho, \u201cCan\u2019t I communicate this to my 5000 employees in all the cities where we have offices in Brazil?\u201d With that question \u2013 and offer \u2013 Carvalho saw the need to pivot and build a B2B company.\n After only three years in Brazil, one of his biggest Brazilian clients asked Carvalho to expand to Mexico, because his company had a large presence there and he wanted to offer Gympass to its employees. And so follows most of the expansion stories.\n \u201cWe expanded to Spain, because we worked with a Spanish bank in Mexico, and they wanted their employees in Spain to have access to our product,\u201d he said.\n This round, which doubles the company\u2019s valuation to $2.2 billion, includes participation from SoftBank, General Atlantic, More Strategic Ventures, Kaszek Ventures and Valor.

The latter fund is in addition, and designed to complement, a  previously unannounced   $2.3 billion global \u201cLeaders\u201d fund that is focused on later-stage investing \u00a0that Accel closed in December.\n  Accel expects to invest in about 20 to 30 companies per fund on average, according to Partner Rich Wong. Its average investment in its growth fund will be in the $50 million to $75 million range, and $75 million and $100 million out of its global Leaders fund.\n But the firm is also still eager and \u201cexcited\u201d to incubate companies, Wong said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll still write $500,000 to $1 million seed checks,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to work with companies from the very beginning and support them through their entire journey.\u201d\n Indeed, as TechCrunch recently reported, Accel has a history of backing companies that were previously bootstrapped (and often profitable) -\u2013 the latest example being  Lower, a Columbus, Ohio-based fintech, which just raised a  $100 million Series A.\n Interestingly, Accel is often referred to some of these companies by existing portfolio companies (also in the case of Lower, whose CEO was referred to Accel by Galileo Clay Wilkes). More often than not, companies that Accel backs out of its early-stage and growth funds are bootstrapped and located outside of Silicon Valley.\n The venture firm has long looked outside of Silicon Valley for opportunities, and has had offices not only in the Bay Area, but in London and Bangalore for years. Part of its investment thesis is to \u201cinvest early and locally,\u201d according to Wong. Examples of this philosophy include investments in companies based all over the world \u2014 from Mexico to Stockholm to Tel Aviv to Munich.\n Since the time of its last fund closure in 2019, the firm has seen 10 portfolio companies go public, including  Slack, Austin-based Bumble, Bucharest-based UiPath, CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, Deliveroo and  Squarespace, among others.\n  It also had 40 companies experience an M&amp;A, including Utah-based Qualtrics\u2019s $8 billion acquisition by SAP and Segment\u2019s $3.2 billion acquisition by Twilio. Also, just last week, Rockwell Automation announced it was   buying Michigan-based Plex Systems  for  $2.22 billion in cash. Accel first invested in Plex, which has developed a subscription-based smart manufacturing platform, in 2012.\n Recent investments include a number of fintech companies such as LatAm\u2019s  Flink, Berlin-based  Trade Republic,  Unit and Robinhood rival  Public. Accel has also backed as existing portfolio companies such as  Webflow, a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites and events startup  Hopin.\n   \u201cFor example, we\u2019ll look at automation companies, consumer businesses and security companies, but at a global scale. Our goal is to find the best entrepreneurs regardless of where they are,\u201d she said.\n That has only been intensified by the recent rise of the smartphone and cloud, Wong said.\n \u201cBefore, companies were mostly selling to the consumer in their own country,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now the size of the market is so dramatically bigger, allowing them to become even larger, which is one of the reasons why I believe we\u2019re seeing investment pace at this speed.\u201d\n To support this, it\u2019s notable that Accel\u2019s global Leaders fund is \u201cdramatically\u201d larger than the $500 million Leaders fund the firm closed in 2019.\n Also, de Rycker points out, companies are staying private longer so the opportunity to invest in them until they sell or go public is greater.\n Accel is also patient. In some cases, the firm\u2019s investors will develop \u201cyears-long\u201d relationships with companies they are courting.\n \u201c1Password is an example of this approach,\u201d Wong said. \u201cArun [Mathew] had that relationship for at least six years before that investment was made.

Today, Alphabet\u2019s drone-delivery subsidiary Wing announced that it\u2019s launching its OpenSky app in the U.S. on Google Play and the iOS App Store.\n   The app was launched in Australia back in 2019 for both hobbyist and commercial drone pilots, with help from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The U.S. version was created with input from the FAA for operation in Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) airspaces.\n Using the app, drone operators can request approval to operate in spaces like those around areas, expediting a process that would traditionally take days or weeks to go through.\n \u201cWhy is a drone delivery company investing in an operator app?\u201d Wing asks rhetorically in a blog post. \u201cBecause with nearly two million registered drones in the U.S. already, regulatory compliance of all drones will allow them to share the sky safely. Moreover, compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones \u2014 among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery \u2014 to more people.\u201d",

", "note_en": "At first blush, it may seem like a textbook example of a startup idea destined never to get anywhere. By definition, any new search engine competes with Google, whose 90 percent-plus market share leaves little oxygen for other players. And we\u2019ve been accustomed to getting our search for free since well  before there was a Google\u2014which might make paying for it sound like being expected to purchase a phone book.\n But  Neeva is indeed a new search engine, officially launching today, that carries a subscription fee. Though it\u2019s extremely similar to Google in many respects\u2014with a few twists of its own\u2014it dumps the web giant\u2019s venerable ad-based business model in the interest of avoiding distractions, privacy quandaries, and other compromises. It\u2019s free for three months\u2014long enough for users to grow accustomed to it without obligation\u2014and $4.95 a month thereafter. Apps for iPhones and iPads, and browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave, are part of the deal.\n Neeva may have a certain whiff of improbability about it, but its cofounders,  Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan, are the furthest thing from na\u00effs. Two long-time Google executives with more than a quarter-century of experience at the web giant between them, they have an insider\u2019s understanding of how it operates. Moreover, about 30 percent of the roughly 60-person staff they\u2019ve assembled at Neeva consists of ex-Googlers, including Hall-of-Famers such as Udi Manber (a former head of Google search) and Darin Fisher (one of the inventors of Chrome). They\u2019ve also secured $77.5 million in funding, including investments from venture-capital titans Greylock and Sequoia.\n  At its highest level, Neeva represents a bet that the way Google monetizes search and other services through advertising\u2014as it\u2019s done for more than two decades to wildly profitable effect\u2014has hampered its user experience, thereby opening up an opportunity. \u201cI tell people that Neeva is as much a social experiment as it is a technological experiment,\u201d says Ramaswamy, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s looking for the answer to the question, \u2018If there was a high-quality product that clearly benefits you in multiple ways, would you pay for it as opposed to having it be free, supported by ads?&#39;\u201d\n Whatever the answer to that question, Neeva\u2019s creators understand what they\u2019re getting into. \u201cSridhar and Vivek, with their depth of knowledge on everything from technology to what people actually need and do, are probably the only people in the world where I would go, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll go on this journey with you, because you know how to go on this journey,&#39;\u201d says Greylock partner and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.\n (Which is not to say there aren\u2019t other ambitious privacy-centric search engines on journeys at least somewhat similar to Neeva\u2019s. DuckDuckGo has been on its own for 13 years;  once a one-man operation, it now has  129 employees and $100 million in annual revenue from ads that don\u2019t involve tracking individual users. And Brave, the browser company  founded by web pioneer Brendan Eich, is beta-testing its own  privacy-first search engine and says free and for-pay versions will be available.)\n  Looming antitrust case aside, it\u2019s not that Google is all that obviously vulnerable. Over the years, unlike some products with monopolistic market share\u2014 Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer comes to mind\u2014the search behemoth hasn\u2019t calcified through lack of competition. Instead, it remains the category\u2019s\u00a0 leading engine of innovation: Google says that it  rolled out 4,500 improvements\u00a0last year alone.\n But  some of the downsides of Google\u2019s dependence on ad revenues are right before our eyes. Once famously unobtrusive, the ads displayed with search results have gradually migrated from the right column to the top of search results, multiplied in number and size, and lost the shaded box that isolated them from organic results. Today, for many searches, ads all but crowd the organic results off the screen until you scroll downwards. For others, links to Google\u2019s own money-making services, such as Google Flights, get prime real estate.\n  Then there\u2019s the fact that Google  builds profiles of its users based on their online activity, the better to precisely target them with advertising not only at its own sites but all the other ones across the web whose ads are powered by Google. With no ads to serve up, Neeva shouldn\u2019t leave privacy-conscious types feeling like they\u2019re being monitored for ulterior purposes. (By default, Neeva does hold onto your searches for 90 days to improve the quality of features such as autosuggestions, but you can erase this log or tell the service you don\u2019t want it to keep it in the first place.)\n  In another break from search-engine tradition, Neeva says that it will  turn at least 20 percent of its top-line revenue over to publishing partners, including the first two it\u2019s announced, Quora and Medium. Though the details of where this could lead remain vague, it\u2019s another attempt to set Neeva apart from Google, which has often been accused of benefiting from media outlets\u2019 content without adequate compensation, a long-simmering dispute that has led to  lawsuits and  legislation. (After years of controversy, Google can at least point to the fact that it\u2019s  spending $1 billion on programs involving giving money to news outlets.)\n  Ramaswamy and Raghunathan tend to frame their discomfort about Google\u2019s business model in polite terms. One of Neeva\u2019s investors\u2014NYU professor, author, and entrepreneur  Scott Galloway\u2014isn\u2019t so circumspect. As you might expect of someone who has  called for the breakup of Google and other tech giants, he\u2019s withering in his analysis of Google and enthusiastic about the possibility of an upstart like Neeva chipping away at its pervasiveness.\n \u201cThe addictive nature of search, of getting answers at your fingertips or connecting with people, that\u2019s sort of the nicotine,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for you, it\u2019s addictive, but it doesn\u2019t give you cancer. The thing that gives you cancer, the tobacco, if you will, is the ad model. Because ultimately, over time, all you\u2019re focused on is gathering more data on the consumer so that you can further monetize him or her. And where it ends up is where you are now with Google, where Google no longer takes you to the best place based on your query, but to another place they can further monetize.\u201d\n  Galloway emphasizes that he put money into Neeva mostly because he thinks it\u2019s a smart investment. At the same time, he adds, \u201cI want to be a small part of the effort to try and release the stranglehold that Google has on content discovery. I think it leads to very bad places.\u201d\n Even if you\u2019re nowhere near as agitated over Google\u2019s dominance and practices as Galloway is, you might find yourself rooting for for what Neeva is trying to accomplish. Search \u201cis a phenomenal daily habit that has transformed how we live,\u201d says Neeva board member Margo Georgiadis, herself a former high-ranking Googler who ran the company\u2019s commercial and ad operations in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. \u201cBut there\u2019s an opportunity with how we\u2019ve evolved the way we live our lives and use technology to make it much, much better if your business model is aligned 100 percent with the consumer.\u201d\n It\u2019s hard to bring up ad-subsidized services from big tech companies without someone helpfully reminding you that if  you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the product. With Neeva\u2019s subscription-based model, the product is unquestionably the product. It just needs to be a compelling one\u2014even though its team is small and the competition has a 23-year head start.\n  In a way, the Neeva story begins in 2003. That\u2019s when Ramaswamy joined Google and was put to work on its still-nascent advertising team. Placing targeted text ads next to search results was already proving to be a powerful idea, but \u201clittle did I, or most others, realize that this would be one of the largest businesses ever,\u201d he remembers. He devoted the next fifteen years to the engineering side of that growth, eventually overseeing 10,000 Googlers as senior VP of ads and commerce.\n But by the latter part of that time, he was developing qualms about the whole proposition of monetizing eyeballs through targeted ads all around the web, as Google was doing. \u201cOne of the things that I paid a lot of attention to is how data was separated between off-Google experiences and on-Google experiences,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo me, keeping that data separate was an important part of the promise that Google implicitly made to its users.\u201d Increasingly, however, he found himself having to consent to compromises such as users\u2019 Google searches influencing the ads they saw on YouTube.\n \u201cWe tried to be thoughtful about how information flowed around, but it was also very clear where things were pointed at,\u201d Ramaswamy says. Having had his fill of the dilemmas associated with the ad business, he explored the possibility of pivoting to a different role within Google. Ultimately, \u201cI decided that a clean start was what I needed,\u2019 he says.\n  After quitting Google in the fall of 2018, he thought he\u2019d found that clean start as a venture capitalist at Greylock. The conflict between ad-based business models and serving users remained on his mind, though. Thinking about it took him down the path that would lead to Neeva.\n Soon, he was joined in this exploration by Raghunathan, who\u2019d had an impressive Google career of his own. In the middle of it, he\u2019d worked on  Google Now, an initiative to make search more anticipatory that later evolved into the Google Assistant. He says that he found shaping the future of search to be exhilarating, but nonetheless then \u201cwent over to the dark side, and I monetized YouTube.\u201d\n Like Ramaswamy, Raghunathan wrestled with the effect that business pressures had on user experiences. Marketers love to reinforce their messaging by exposing consumers to the same ad over and over and over. YouTube fans rankle at such repetition. Guess whose interests won out? \u201cWe\u2019d have these well-intentioned conversations around trading off users\u2019 happiness for customer value,\u201d Raghunathan recounts.\n  Still at Google, Raghunathan chatted with Ramaswamy about the startup idea the latter was formulating. \u201cI remember him telling me this insight, this string he was pulling on,\u201d says Raghunathan. \u201cThat you could not reimagine search the product without reimagining the business model that underpins search.\u201d Eager to join that effort, Raghunathan left Google after almost 12 years to become Neeva\u2019s cofounder.\n (Why the name \u201cNeeva?\u201d Raghunathan cheerfully admits that they chose it, then backfilled in a rationale: \u201cIn hindsight, there is a story we can tell about Neeva, in Sanskrit, meaning \u2018fundamentals\u2019 or \u2018the basics.\u2019 It actually means something that is very core to our mission. But I\u2019d be lying if I told you we knew that.\u201d)\n As Ramaswamy and Raghunathan recruited a team, they found that other Googlers past and present were eager to take a fresh look at search, including some whom they hadn\u2019t known at their old company. \u201cThe kind of ideas I heard from Sridhar and Vivek really excited me,\u201d says Bindu Pucha, who was once an IBM Research staffer, spent five years at Google, and now works on infrastructure technology for Neeva.\n  For Udi Manber, what Neeva was up to was compelling enough to lure him back into search, an area he\u2019d left behind in 2015 to focus on health-related technologies at the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. Earlier this year, he joined Neeva part-time, spending two or three days a week on research efforts.\n A legendary computer scientist who held top jobs at Yahoo and Amazon as well as Google, Manber was another key Googler who had his frustrations with the dynamics of ad-subsidized search. \u201cI was one of the biggest advocates of privacy at Google, and I pushed for it a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI won some fights. I lost many others.\u201d The fact that Neeva is tiny is liberating, he argues: \u201cInnovation is hard for every company, but I think small companies are better at it than large companies overall.\u201d\n  To say that Neeva is in a position to rethink search is not to suggest that it\u2019s trying to change everything. What it\u2019s launching is not the iPhone to Google\u2019s BlackBerry. Indeed, much of the user experience can fairly be described as \u201cGoogle-like.\u201d\n  That\u2019s not a bad thing. \u201cThe paradox and the challenge here is that it has to be different enough from what already exists to get attention and to be engaging, but not so radically different that it\u2019s disorienting to people,\u201d says Greg Sterling, a  long-time observer of the search business and VP of market insights at location marketing company Uberall. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird tight rope that I think they\u2019re trying to walk.\u201d\n They\u2019re not doing it alone.\u00a0Neeva has indexed several billion web pages on its own but also credits Apple, Bing, and Yelp at the bottom of search results; other information providers include\u00a0Intrinio, Weather.com, and Xignite.\u00a0Even Google is an ingredient, with Google Maps embedded in search results.\n \u201cWherever we can build, we will build,\u201d declares Raghunathan. \u201cWhere we can license or buy, we will. Users don\u2019t care. And so we will do what makes sense for users to build a maximally differentiated, maximally useful, maximally, delightful product.\u201d\n  Nothing about the end result is likely to discombobulate the Googling masses. There\u2019s a search field that looks just like Google\u2019s search field\u2014except that it sports a rotating set of taglines such as \u201cNo ads here\u201d and \u201cYou are not the product.\u201d There are autosuggestions as you type, plus links to related searches and \u201cPeople Also Asked\u201d queries. Rows of videos and news items are interspersed throughout the results, and the right column often includes a block of facts on whatever you searched for based on sources such as Wikipedia.\n  Dig into the same results on Neeva and Google, however, and you\u2019ll notice some differences. For instance, while both search engines respond to searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d with tidy carousels summarizing expert reviews, they\u2019re more prominent on Neeva, while Google puts a similar-looking carousel of paid links at the top. You can also expand Neeva\u2019s summaries into more detailed previews without leaving the search results, a boon for comparison shopping. (The service takes a similar approach with recipes.)\n The Google home page consists of a search field, \u201cGoogle Search\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky\u201d buttons, and an expanse of white space\u2014remarkably unchanged from its original look back in 1998. Neeva, by contrast, fills its home page with personalizable widgets. They include ones for local weather, stock prices of your choice, and news. That last widget consists entirely of stories from name-brand media outlets\u2014from  The Daily Beast to Fox News\u2014and you can customize it by specifying which sources you want to see more often or less often.\n  Still another distinguishing characteristic is Neeva\u2019s integrations with third-party services. You can hook the service up with information sources such as your Gmail or Outlook email and calendar, Google Drive or Dropbox storage, and/or Slack or Jira account. Neeva will then index them and intersperse material from them in your search results as well as presenting it in a dedicated \u201cPersonal\u201d tab. Google has experimented with similar concepts in the past\u2014it once  mashed up Google search and Gmail\u2014but seems to have moved on from the concept.\n  For all that\u2019s nice about Neeva\u2014starting with its organic results sitting at the top of the page rather than below a payload of advertising\u2014it hasn\u2019t done the impossible by reaching Google-like sophistication right out of the gate. Those product-oriented results for searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d are well packaged, but the ones I checked out were thin on sources, with  PC Mag dominating the review links to such an extent that I wondered if it was through some partnership deal. (It isn\u2019t.)\n Neeva also doesn\u2019t do local information anywhere near as well as Google: It knows my Zip Code, but when I searched for a local pizza chain, it gave me a map for the branch 28 miles away, not the one within walking distance. It can answer questions such as \u201cWhat time is it in Rio?\u201d and \u201cHow tall is Joe Biden?\u201d with facts that appear on the results page itself, but it doesn\u2019t do so for as dizzying an array of queries as Google does.\u00a0When I used the pre-release site, I also encountered the occasional out-and-out glitch, like a thumbnail map of San Francisco that turned into Indianapolis when I clicked on it.\n  Ramaswamy acknowledges that in its current state, Neeva is something of a rough draft: \u201cWe have several large launches planned for next month, on the search quality side, after being publicly available,\u201d he says. It will be interesting to see where it gets by the fall, when the people now signing up conclude their three-month free trials and choose whether to become paying customers.\n Where it could go after that is hard to say, but it\u2019s not like search has no remaining problems to solve. \u00a0When I asked Manber about what he was working on, he wouldn\u2019t tell me: \u201cI learned a long time ago to talk about things only after I\u2019ve done them, not when I\u2019m just planning to do them.\u201d\n  As I began working on this article and got pre-release access to Neeva, I wanted to use it all the time. To ensure that I didn\u2019t reflexively Google for anything, I went into Safari\u2019s settings to change my default search engine to Neeva. It was only then that I realized I couldn\u2019t. Most major browsers make you pick from a few pre-selected search engines, not (yet) including Neeva; only Chrome allows you to choose one that\u2019s not on its canned list.\n That experience underlined that Neeva is entering a world that isn\u2019t exactly wired to give a new stand-alone search engine its best shot at success. To control its destiny, a search company really needs to write at least some of its own software; it\u2019s not a coincidence that everyone from Google to  DuckDuckGo has come out with a browser. And now so has Neeva, with its iPhone and iPadOS browsers as well as extensions that embed similar functionality in other browsers.\n \u201cThe browser and search are just so intertwined, right?\u201d says Neeva software engineer Darin Fisher. \u201cSearch is such an important part of the UI of the browser.\u201d Fisher knows whereof he speaks: He\u2019s a 21-year veteran of the browser wars whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes Netscape and Firefox as well as Chrome from  its inception until earlier this year.\n According to Fisher, the symbiotic nature of browsing and searching can create design conundrums that put a browser/search engine company at odds with its users. For example, if you type the name of a site into the browser\u2019s address bar, will it send you right there? Or will it err on the side of directing you to a page of search results it can monetize through ads?\n With no ads, Neeva can resist such temptations. \u201cWhen I think about Neeva and that simple business model that it has\u2014if people are happy, they\u2019re paying\u2014it opens the door to not having that tension,\u201d says Fisher.\n Along with putting the Neeva search engine front and center, the company\u2019s apps and extensions allow it to implement privacy-related features it couldn\u2019t implement purely as web services. While browsing a website, you can click on an icon near its address to get a summary of the trackers it contains that monitor your browsing for advertising and other purposes; you can also turn on a feature called Tracking Prevention, which blocks such surveillance and speeds up page rendering.\n  A few days before Neeva\u2019s official debut, as I used the pre-release browser, I found that it not only foiled trackers but also eliminated advertisements all over the web. It turned out that Neeva was also surprised by the sweeping ad deletion, an artifact of its browser\u2019s reliance on core technologies from Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.

That could keep programmers who already use the company&#39;s tools satisfied and also attract new ones.\n  The system, called GitHub Copilot, draws on source code uploaded to code-sharing service GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, as well as other websites. Microsoft and GitHub developed it with help from OpenAI, an AI research start-up that Microsoft  backed in 2019.\n Researchers at Microsoft and other institutions have been trying to teach computers to write code for decades. The concept has yet to go mainstream, at times because programs to write programs have not been versatile enough. The GitHub Copilot effort is a notable attempt in the field, relying as it does on a large volume of code in many programming languages and vast Azure cloud computing power.\n Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, describes GitHub Copilot as a virtual version of what software creators call  a pair programmer -- that&#39;s when two developers work side by side collaboratively on the same project. The tool looks at existing code and comments in the current file and the location of the cursor, and it offers up one or more lines to add. As programmers accept or reject suggestions, the model learns and becomes more sophisticated over time.\n The new software makes coding faster, Friedman said in an interview last week. Hundreds of developers at GitHub have been using the Copilot feature all day while coding, and the majority of them are accepting suggestions and not turning the feature off, Friedman said.\n Programming involves coming up with an idea about how to do something and then implementing it, and GitHub Copilot is good at the second part, said Greg Brockman, a co-founder of OpenAI and its chief technology officer.\n  &#34;You don&#39;t want to go read  Twilio&#39;s API documentation. It knows all that stuff. It&#39;s actually quite reliable at it,&#34; he said. Brockman calls this work last-mile programming, and he said that having computers take care of it leads to speed improvements.\n  &#34;It can save me from having to dive through a whole bunch of documentation to get a tool to do a thing that I know it&#39;s capable of doing, and that is so good for productivity,&#34; he said. &#34;I can&#39;t even tell you the number of hours I&#39;ve wasted trying to figure out the right way to do a relatively prosaic thing, just navigating the complexity of these tools.&#34;\n  &#34;It may very well be one of those things that makes programming itself more approachable,&#34; Scott said.\n It supports almost every programming language, but it&#39;s been designed to work best with JavaScript, Python and TypeScript, Friedman said.\n GitHub Copilot will first appear in Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code, a free open-source product, and Microsoft plans to incorporate it into the commercial Visual Studio product in the future.\n  The model at the core of GitHub Copilot, called Codex, is a descendent of GPT-3, a powerful model that OpenAI trained on large volumes of text, Brockman said. Engineers fed the model &#34;many, many terabytes of public source code out there,&#34; Friedman said.\n This isn&#39;t the first time Microsoft has leaned on OpenAI to deliver smart software. Last month  Microsoft showed how it would update the Power Apps Studio application, which nontechnical people use to write apps, so that users could type in words describing the elements they&#39;d like to add and have GPT-3 show options for the necessary code.\n OpenAI recognizes the potential for AI models to come up with code with GPT-3, which it introduced last year. The start-up says on  its website that an online service delivering GPT-3 can handle &#34;code completion.&#34; But back when OpenAI was first training the model, the start-up had no intention of teaching it how to help code, Brockman said. It was meant more as  a general purpose language model that could, for instance, generate articles, fix incorrect grammar and translate from one language into another.\n Over the next few months, people experimented with the model to see what it could do, both useful and silly --  for instance, one engineer made a website that could design a button that looked like a watermelon. Brockman reached out to Friedman, as he was running a key destination where millions of programmers work on code and things proceeded from there.\n GitHub employees have tried to ensure that GitHub Copilot will generate secure, high-quality code. &#34;We&#39;ve built a number of safety mechanisms into Copilot that we think are cutting-edge in terms of reducing the chances of mistakes in various areas here, but they&#39;re definitely not perfect,&#34; Friedman said.\n The underlying technology won&#39;t be only Microsoft&#39;s to use. OpenAI will release the Codex model this summer for third-party developers to weave into their own applications, Brockman said.\n Microsoft could someday release a version of the product that enterprises could train to understand their programming styles, Scott said. For now, Microsoft is only offering the service that knows about code stored in public repositories.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

regulatory and governmental approvals, in a press release post-publication. It also confirmed that the price of the acquisition which will be an $800 million all-cash deal.\n The deal gives 2U,  a company that filed to go public in 2014 and continues to be one of the rare U.S. edtech companies listed on the stock market, a new wave of collaboratively-built content to its software. Plus, 2U just acquired with stronger name recognition thanks to its Ivy League backers, which some see as a branding move that could help the public company with its own chunk of the market. The company\u2019s last big acquisition was in 2019,  when it paid $750 million to acquire Trilogy education, a company that builds in-person and online bootcamps in collaboration with universities.\n  EdX was founded in 2012 amid a crop of massive open online course (MOOC) offerings, including Udacity and Coursera. The company, set up as a non-profit, had an alluring promise upon launch: it would help anyone in the world take a Harvard or MIT class, for free. The institutions, of course, have thrown in a cumulative $80 million in donations into edX to keep the operation free.  Its own launch came weeks after Coursera announced that Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, and the University of Michigan would host courses on its own online learning platform. Now, edX\u2019s acquisition comes months after Coursera went public.\n  Today, edX, led by president and professor Anant Agarwal, hosts over 3,000 courses led by 15,000 instructors and used by 35 million users. Open edX, the platform\u2019s open source platform, is used by 2,400 learning sites worldwide,  according to the organization\u2019s website.\n EdX will turn into a public benefit corporation as part of this transaction. Per sources, proceeds from the transaction will go into another non-profit managed by Harvard and MIT, and the institutions will not profit off of the transaction. That said, an MIT statement reveals. that edX took a line of credit from MIT and Harvard, and those funds will be returned to both institutions.\n \u201cBecause edX is a public charity, the proceeds from its sale can only be distributed for a purpose consistent with edX\u2019s mission, not to compensate those who contributed to the nonprofit,\u201d  the statement reads.\n Part of this transaction, which has been in the works since February 2021, is colored by the fact that edX has been transparent with its own financial woes and journey to becoming a self-sustaining business. Then MIT Provost Rafael Reif, now the president of the school, had  hinted at eventual revenue generation the program first launched, saying in 2012 that \u201cthe drive is not to make money..that said, we intend to find a way to support those activities. There are several approaches we are considering, and we don\u2019t want this project to become a drain on the budgets of MIT or Harvard.\u201d\n In 2018, the same fiscal year it  had $37 million in revenue, edX introduced  a support fee, alongside its ongoing offering that asks students to pay for a verified certification upon course completion. In announcement, the company wrote that \u201cwe believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.\u201d The edX board also considered other options, MIT. said,  but decided those were \u201cnot as beneficial to edX, its learners, or its partner institutions as the transaction with 2U.\u201d\n The new transaction and edX\u2019s choice to turn into a public benefit corporation might become the financial model that it itself was looking for, indicating just how. hard it may be to monetize a MOOC. While 2U has committed to continuing edX\u2019s free coursework for at least five years, as well as seeding a new non-profit, edX as it currently stands \u2013 a massive education non-profit \u2013 will no longer function as it currently does in the future.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

\uff08song@heraldcorp.com\uff09 ", "note_en": "A Seoul court\u2019s decision last week that effectively confirmed Netflix\u2018s obligation to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers suggests that the global video streaming giant might have to change its business strategy in South Korea, according to industry sources Monday.   The US-based content provider that raised 415.5 billion won ($367.6 million) in revenue in Korea alone last year has not been paying network fees to provider SK Broadband, the internet protocol TV subsidiary of SK Telecom.   The SK unit filed a complaint with the Korea Communications Commission in November 2019, and Netflix sued SK a few months later. Netflix asked the court to review whether or not it has an obligation to pay for its network usage.   On Friday, the court ruled against Netflix, saying, \u201cAccording to the principle of freedom of contract, whether to conclude a contract and what price to pay is a matter to be decided through the negotiations of the concerned parties.\u201d\u00a0  The court also said, \u201cNetflix is at least receiving network services, including management of the network quality, at a cost.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cIt is also reasonable to say that Netflix has the obligation of paying the price for the services to SK Broadband.\u201d  Friday\u2018s ruling was interpreted by industry watchers as indicating the principle of net neutrality is losing ground in Korea, where global platform giants, including Facebook and Google, would be obligated to pay the price for their massive network traffic as they see growing numbers of Korean subscribers.   \u201cThis decision clearly confirms by law that Netflix needs to pay network usage fees to SK Broadband,\u201d the internet service provider said.   It seems highly likely that Netflix will appeal, although the US firm officially said it will continue its partnership with SK Broadband for both companies\u2019 customers and promised to continue investing in its \u201copen connect\u201d strategy.   The US firm has forged marketing partnerships with KT and LG U+, giving it an upper hand on the fee issue with the two other mobile carriers.\u00a0  \u00a0On Monday, SKT CEO Park Jung-ho commented on the issue, saying, \u201cThe time has come to meet Netflix.\u201d  \u201cI think the ruling can make our meeting much better. Cooperation in Asia will be important for Netflix.\u201d   According to industry estimates, the total fees Netflix will have to pay to all three mobile carriers would be over 100 billion won a year.   Netflix accounted for 4.8 percent of the country\u2019s total network traffic in the fourth quarter of 2020.   Korean portal giant Naver, which accounted for 1.8 percent of all traffic, paid around 70 billion won last year. Kakao paid around 30 billion won   The court estimated the network usage fee for SK would be around 200 billion won.   \u201cIf Netflix changes its stance and is willing to talk with us, both firms could appraise the exact amount of fees,\u201d an official from SK Broadband said. \u201cHowever, an appeal is highly likely to follow.\u201d   Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic affected Korea, the number of Netflix users grew and network traffic spiked due to the streaming service, the SK official explained.   Since the Korean telecommunications network is part of the national backbone, when network speeds slow down, mobile carriers are forced to deal with poor network quality.   Also, unlike in the United States where the net neutrality principle was abandoned, Korea keeps the principle that stipulates internet service providers should treat all data on the internet the same, and not discriminate against content providers.   Netflix, which pays usage fees in the US, Japan and France, insists on net neutrality in Korea.   \u201cThe latest ruling might give KT and LG U+ room for negotiating the fee,\u201d said an industry official. \u201cIt would also affect entries and business strategies of other foreign content providers like Disney+ and Amazon Prime that are eyeing the Korean market.\u201d\u00a0  ( song@heraldcorp.com)", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f51\u7edc,traffic,netflix", "title": "\u97e9\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u5b9aNetflix\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u4f7f\u7528\u8d39; Netflix\u57282020\u5e74\u7b2c\u56db\u5b63\u5ea6\u5360\u8be5\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u76844.8\uff05 ", "title_en": "A South Korean court has ruled that Netflix is obligated to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers; Netflix made up 4.8% of the country's traffic in Q4 2020", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210628000798", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f51\u7edc", "traffic", "netflix"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cd79ea6516cd435bdfe215883d9a5383.jpg", "infoid": 1068552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Snapchat\u662f\u8b66\u544aiPhone\u7528\u6237\uff0cApp Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\n  Snapchat\u4e0a\u6b21\u57286\u670828\u65e5\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86IOS\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7248\u672c11.34.0.35\u66f4\u65b0\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u6d88\u606f\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u53d1\u5e03\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u51fa\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n \u8bb8\u591aSnapchat\u7528\u6237\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u5b83\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5d29\u6e83\u5230iPhone\u4e3b\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u89e6\u53d1\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u6599\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89c1\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\n  Snapchat\uff06\uff0339; S\u652f\u6301\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u5230Twitter\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8b66\u544a\u7528\u6237\uff06\uff0334;\u6302\u7d27\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u5e76\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\uff06\uff0334;\n \u867d\u7136\u5b83\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7App Store Review\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u67e5\u672c\u8eab\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7248\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\n \u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0b\u53487:23\u3002\u4e1c\u90e8\uff1aSnapchat\u62a5\u544a\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u7ee7\u7eed\u770b\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7528\u6237\u88ab\u6307\u793a\u624b\u52a8\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u7248\u672c11.34.1.35\u3002\n \u5728\u6bcf\u5468AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4e2d\u8ddf\u4e0aApple  - \u5e76\u6bcf\u5929\u4eceAppleInsider\u83b7\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u65b0\u95fb\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u521a\u8bf4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u563f\uff0c\u897f\u91cc\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u60a8\u7684HomePod Mini\u5e76\u8be2\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u65b0\u7684HomeKit Insider Enisode\u3002 \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e3b\u8981AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u82f9\u679c\uff06\uff0339; s vodcasts\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba2\u96055\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7Patreon\u6765\u652f\u6301AppleInsider Podcast\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u559c\u6b22\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u64ad\u5ba2\u64ad\u653e\u5668\u3002  AppleInsider\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4ea4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u57f9\u8bad\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002 \u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 ", "note_en": "Snapchat is warning iPhone users that the version of the messaging app available in the  App Store has a problem, and is something the company is trying to solve.\n  Snapchat last updated its  iOS app in the App Store on  June 28, with the version 11.34.0.35 update adding a number of &#34;bug fixes&#34; to the messaging tool.

If so, the updated version could arrive fairly soon.\n Update, 7:23 p.m. Eastern: Snapchat reports the issue has  been fixed.

The report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health, is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of international experts appointed by WHO. \u201cLike all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cThis important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.\u201d Artificial intelligence can be, and in some wealthy countries is already being used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and screening for diseases; to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management. AI could also empower patients to take greater control of their own health care and better understand their evolving needs. It could also enable resource-poor countries and rural communities, where patients often have restricted access to health-care workers or medical professionals, to bridge gaps in access to health services.However, WHO\u2019s new report cautions against overestimating the benefits of AI for health, especially when this occurs at the expense of core investments and strategies required to achieve universal health coverage.It also points out that opportunities are linked to challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data; biases encoded in algorithms, and risks of AI to patient safety, cybersecurity, and the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example, while private and public sector investment in the development and deployment of AI is critical, the unregulated use of AI could subordinate the rights and interests of patients and communities to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control. The report also emphasizes that systems trained primarily on data collected from individuals in high-income countries may not perform well for individuals in low- and middle-income settings. AI systems should therefore be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socio-economic and health-care settings. They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients. Ultimately, guided by existing laws and human rights obligations, and new laws and policies that enshrine ethical principles, governments, providers, and designers must work together to address ethics and human rights concerns at every stage of an AI technology\u2019s design, development, and deployment.\u00a0\u00a0Six principles to ensure AI works for the public interest in all countriesTo limit the risks and maximize the opportunities intrinsic to the use of AI for health, WHO provides the following principles as the basis for AI regulation and governance:Protecting human autonomy: In the context of health care, this means that humans should remain in control of health-care systems and medical decisions; privacy and confidentiality should be protected, and patients must give valid informed consent through appropriate legal frameworks for data protection.Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest. The designers of AI technologies should satisfy regulatory requirements for safety, accuracy and efficacy for well-defined use cases or indications. Measures of quality control in practice and quality improvement in the use of AI must be available. Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility. Transparency requires that sufficient information be published or documented before the design or deployment of an AI technology. Such information must be easily accessible and facilitate meaningful public consultation and debate on how the technology is designed and how it should or should not be used. Fostering responsibility and accountability. Although AI technologies perform specific tasks, it is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that they are used under appropriate conditions and by appropriately trained people. Effective mechanisms should be available for questioning and for redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by decisions based on algorithms.Ensuring inclusiveness and equity. Inclusiveness requires that AI for health be designed to encourage the widest possible equitable use and access, irrespective of age, sex, gender, income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or other characteristics protected under human rights codes. Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable. Designers, developers and users should continuously and transparently assess AI applications during actual use to determine whether AI responds adequately and appropriately to expectations and requirements. AI systems should also be designed to minimize their environmental consequences and increase energy efficiency.

", "note_en": "Sunnyvale-based, Israeli-founded JFrog is publicly traded on Nasdaq, where it went public last September, and currently it has a market cap of  $4.65 billion. Vdoo, meanwhile, had raised about $70 million from investors that include NTT, Dell, GGV and Verizon (disclaimer: Verizon owns TechCrunch), and when we covered its  most recent funding round, we estimated that the valuation was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, making this a decent return.\n Shlomi Ben Haim, JFrog\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said that his company\u2019s turn to focusing deeper on security, and making this acquisition in particular to fill out that strategy, are a natural progression in its aim to built out an end-to-end platform for the DevOps team.\n  \u201cWhen we started JFrog, the main challenge was to educate the market on what we saw as most important priorities when it comes to building, testing and deploying software,\u201d he said. Then sometime around 2015-2016 he said they started to realize there was a \u201ccrack\u201d in the system, \u201ca crack called security.\u201d InfoSec engineers and developers sometimes work at cross purposes, as \u201cdevelopers became too fast\u201d the work they were doing was inadvertently led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.\n JFrog has been building a number of tools since then to address that and to bring the collective priorities together, such as its XRay product. And indeed, Vdoo is not JFrog\u2019s first foray into security, but it represents a significant step deeper into the hardware and systems that are being run on software. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important leap forward,\u201d Ben Haim said.\n For its part, Vdoo was born out of a realization as well as a challenging mission: IoT and other connected devices \u2014 a universe of some 50 billion pieces of hardware as of last year \u2014 represents a massive security headache, and not just because of the volume of devices: each object uses and interacts with software in the cloud and so each instance represents a potential vulnerability, with zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among some of the most common.\n While connected-device security up to now has typically focused on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it, Vdoo\u2019s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves on top of that, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. Interestingly, this mirrors the kind of binary analysis that JFrog provides in its DevOps platform, making the two complementary to each other.\n But what\u2019s notable is that this will give JFrog a bigger play at the edge, since part of Vdoo\u2019s platform works on devices themselves, \u201cmicro agents\u201d as the company has described them to me previously, to detect and repair vulnerabilities on endpoints.\n While JFrog has built a lot of its own business from the ground up, it has made a number of acquisitions to bolt on technology (one example:  Shippable, which it used to bring continuous integration and delivery into its DevOps platform). In this case, Netanel Davidi, the co-founder and CEO of Vdoo (who previously co-founded and sold another security startup, Cyvera,  to Palo Alto Networks) said that this was a good fit because the two companies are fundamentally taking the same approaches in their work (another synergy and justification for DevOps and InfoSec being more closely knitted together too I might add).\n \u201cIn terms of the fit between the companies, it\u2019s about our approach to binaries,\u201d Davidi said in an interview, noting that the two being on the same page with this approach was fundamental to the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s only the way to cover the entire pipeline from the very beginning, when they go you develop something, all the way to the device or to the server or to the application or to the mobile phone. That\u2019s the only way to truly understand the context and contextual risk.\u201d\n He also made a note not just of the tech but of the talent that is coming on with the acquisition: 100 people joining JFrog\u2019s 800.\n \u201cIf JFrog chose to build something like this themselves, they could have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the uniqueness here is that we have built the best security team, the best security researchers, the best vulnerability researchers, the best reverse engineers, which focus not only on embedded systems, and IoT, which is considered to be the hardest thing to learn and to analyze, but also in software artifacts. We are bringing this knowledge along with us.\u201d\n JFrog said that Vdoo will continue to operate as a standalone SaaS product for the time being. Updates that are made will be in aid of supporting the JFrog platform and the two aim to have a fully integrated, \u201cholistic\u201d product by 2022.\n Along with the deal,\u00a0JFrog reiterated financial guidance for the next quarter that will end June 30, 2021. It expects revenues of $47.6 million to $48.6 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5 million to $1.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.01, assuming approximately 104 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For Full Year 2021, revenues are expected to be $198 million to $204 million,\u00a0with non-GAAP operating income between $5 million and $7 million and an approximately 3% increase in weighted average diluted shares. JFrog anticipates consolidated operating expenses to increase by approximately $9-10 million for the remainder of 2021, subject to the acquisition closing.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:35",

-0.53%  as a client for their goods and services can find that its business comes with a catch: the right for Amazon to buy big stakes in their companies at potentially steep discounts to market value.\n  The technology-and-retail giant has struck at least a dozen deals with publicly traded companies in which it gets rights, called warrants, to buy the vendors\u2019 stock in the future at what could be below-market prices, according to corporate filings and interviews with people involved with the deals.\n  Amazon over the past decade also has done more than 75 such deals with privately held companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In all, the tech titan\u2019s stakes and potential stakes amount to billions of dollars across companies that provide everything from call-center services to natural gas, and in some cases position Amazon among the top shareholders in those businesses.\n  The unusual arrangements offer another window into how Amazon uses its market heft to increase its wealth and clout. The company has been under growing  scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its competitive practices,  including with companies it partners with.\n  While the deals can benefit the suppliers by locking in big contracts, which can also boost their share prices, executives at several of the companies said they felt they couldn\u2019t refuse Amazon\u2019s push for the right to buy the stock without risking a major contract. The deals in some cases also give Amazon rights such as board representation and the ability to top any acquisition offers from other companies.\n  For Amazon, the arrangements give it a piece of the potential upside their vendors can get from doing business with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\n  Amazon routinely leverages its size and power to force terms that benefit itself, including by getting  partners in one business to sign on to its other services; learning about  up-and-coming technology companies through its venture-capital fund; or  creating top selling Amazon branded goods that compete with small sellers on its site. It has aggressively competed to wrest market share from rivals, which Amazon says results in better deals for shoppers.\n  In its supplier deals that include warrants, Amazon throws its weight around to exact lucrative terms, knowing many companies won\u2019t refuse, according to former Amazon executives who worked on the deals.\n  An Amazon spokeswoman said the warrants it obtains in commercial agreements are typically tied to milestones that Amazon has to meet, such as large purchases from the supplier. The company declined to comment on specific deals, or say how many warrants it has exercised or the amount of money it has made from such agreements. The spokeswoman said it has warrant deals in fewer than 1% of the commercial agreements it enters into.\n  Grocery distributor  SpartanNash  last year amended a contract with Amazon to deliver groceries to its Amazon Fresh arm. The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company had been supplying Amazon with food since 2016, but this time Amazon added a condition: if it bought $8 billion worth of groceries over seven years, it could get warrants to purchase around 15% of SpartanNash\u2019s stock at a price potentially lower than the market. Amazon also said it wanted to be notified of any takeover offers for SpartanNash and have a 10-day window to offer a counterbid.\n    SpartanNash executives were taken aback, said people familiar with the matter. No customer had requested such terms before. Executives ultimately decided they didn\u2019t want to haggle with one of SpartanNash\u2019s biggest customers, and that being tied to Amazon could raise their company\u2019s profile, one of the people said. Amazon received warrants in the company when the deal was announced that would amount to 2.5% of its stock if exercised. If it receives and exercises warrants for the additional 12.5%, according to the contract terms, it would be SpartanNash\u2019s second-largest shareholder after mutual-fund manager BlackRock Inc.\n    Amazon has been doing such deals with vendors for about a decade but has aggressively increased the practice in the past few years, said former Amazon executives and lawyers who worked on structuring the deals. In its latest quarterly report, the company valued its warrants at $2.8 billion, more than five times the level three years ago. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the value of stakes it owns as a result of exercising its warrants.\n  A broader measure of its warrants and the stakes it holds in companies through warrants, direct investment or other ways increased 10 times to $8.4 billion in that period, according to Amazon\u2019s quarterly filings.\n  Like stock options, warrants let the holder buy a company\u2019s shares at a set price during a set period. If the stock surpasses that strike price, the warrant holder can buy shares at a below-market price.\n  Corporate executives in a range of industries and lawyers said Amazon\u2019s push to get warrants as part of vendor deals is highly unusual. Warrant deals have more commonly been used by investors who back companies in financial trouble, in deals deemed high risk.\n    Former Amazon executives who worked on warrant deals said they found no direct precedent before the company began striking them. For a guide, an Amazon team sleuthed through financial documents from the 2008 financial crisis to find information about bank bailouts that involved warrants, one of the people said.\n  The Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a few examples of other companies striking warrant arrangements. In 2017,  Walmart  obtained warrants in  Plug Power  a few months after Amazon struck a commercial deal tied to warrants with the company. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company very infrequently obtains warrants in other companies. Plug Power declined to comment.\n  Some suppliers see granting Amazon warrants as a worthwhile competitive advantage.  Clean Energy Fuels  struck a deal with Amazon earlier this year that could give the larger company a 20% stake over the next decade, making it the No. 2 shareholder. Management had never done a commercial deal where it gave the customer warrants, according to a person familiar with the matter, but Amazon had put out a large request for proposals from other natural-gas companies, and Clean Energy determined that accepting the terms of warrants would keep Amazon from choosing to do more business with competitors, the person said. As part of the terms, Clean Energy must notify Amazon if it receives a takeover offer, the person said. Clean Energy declined to comment.\n  Amazon\u2019s first major warrants deal with a publicly traded vendor came in 2016. Amazon was seeking a partner with cargo planes to help build out its massive logistics network. Executives reasoned that the company\u2019s potential partners were all smaller, lesser-known companies with stagnant growth, and that a major contract from Amazon would invigorate their stocks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon wanted some of that potential upside, the person said.\n  Amazon proposed a deal, with warrants, to Wilmington, Ohio-based  Air Transport Services Group  The aircraft-leasing company initially pushed back on the warrant stipulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Its team flew to Seattle and had \u201cintense, protracted negotiations\u201d where Amazon got ATSG to agree to the structure, one of the people said. \u201cIt took a lot of convincing,\u201d the person said. Amazon currently owns around 19.5% of ATSG, making it the biggest shareholder.\n      Amazon executives knew it would need to lease many more planes to handle explosive growth in its delivery operation, and the initial warrant deal emboldened them to demand similar terms from other companies, said one of the people involved.\n  In talks with  Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Amazon broached a 10-year leasing deal, with similar terms. This time Amazon demanded warrants that would amount to up to 20% of Atlas\u2019s equity over five years\u2014with an option for 10% more later\u2014depending on how much business it gave Atlas. Amazon also wanted the right to elect a director to Atlas\u2019s board, after meeting certain milestones.\n  People involved on both sides said that warrants were a condition of Amazon partnering with Atlas. \u201cThere was definitely a sense that if it wasn\u2019t agreed to there wouldn\u2019t be a deal,\u201d said one of the people. Atlas executives didn\u2019t want to pass up the revenue opportunity from Amazon and viewed giving up the warrants as the price of doing business with Amazon, said the person.\n  When it announced the deal in May 2016, Atlas lauded the deal, including the equity arrangement. Its share price soared 27% that day. Such jumps have been common when Amazon has done warrant deals with publicly traded suppliers\u2014SpartanNash\u2019s stock rose 26% on the day it announced its agreement.\n  The strike price for the Atlas warrants was $37.50, slightly below where the shares were trading before the deal was announced. Amazon later exercised warrants for 9% of Atlas\u2019 stock and sold the shares, according to an Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon declined to comment on how much it made on its sale of Atlas stock.\n    Atlas has never done a similar deal, according to the Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon never named a director to Atlas\u2019s board, she said.\n    Amazon also signed a vendor deal with  Cargojet  that included warrants. Cargojet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Amazon often ties its warrants to how much business it gives a supplier. In a deal with Startek Inc., the Colorado-based call-center company agreed to give Amazon the right to acquire 20% of its shares if Amazon does $600 million of business with Startek over eight years. That would make Amazon Startek\u2019s second-largest shareholder, if it were to obtain the warrants and exercise them. Startek didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Former Amazon executives said they avoided doing anything during supplier negotiations, such as putting its ultimatums in writing, that would give fodder to critics who have said Amazon abuses its power. One of the former executives said that most companies complied with its demands over warrants. Several former Amazon executives who worked on such deals said in interviews that they found them to be unfair and one-sided, saying the companies weren\u2019t in a position to refuse and that most of the upside went to Amazon.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u5e02\u573a,docs", "title": "\u6d88\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6587\u4ef6\uff1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u540c\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4e2d\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u5236\u5b9a\u4e8680\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6743\u529b ", "title_en": "Sources and docs: as part of contracts, Amazon has made 80+ deals for stakes in suppliers, often at below-market prices, a sign of how it leverages its power", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-demands-one-more-thing-from-some-vendors-a-piece-of-their-company-11624968099?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u5e02\u573a", "docs"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1b2f6fa28c0d3417726fdfb5e6436695.jpg", "infoid": 1068547, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u4f26\u6566\uff0c6\u670829\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 -  TP ICAP\uff08TCAPI.L\uff09\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u5927\u7684Instumer\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u5bcc\u8fbe\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u8bb8\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6570\u7801\u8d44\u4ea7\u76d1\u62a4\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u3002\n \u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u90e8\u95e8\u52a0\u70ed\u5230\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5e74\u4e0b\u534a\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5141\u8bb8\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ea4\u6613\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u592a\u7f51\u5c06\u88ab\u7a0d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002\n TP ICAP\u548c12\u6708\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\uff08Stan.l\uff09\u548c\u5317\u65b9\u4fe1\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5317\u6781\u4fe1\u6258\u961f\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u5bcc\u8fbe\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548cZodia\u76d1\u62a4\u6743\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u5c06\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u503a\u5238\u548c\u5916\u56fd\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\n \u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u4fdd\u7ba1\u4eba\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u8d38\u6613\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5355\u72ec\u6267\u884c\u548c\u7ed3\u7b97\uff0c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\n \u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u6267\u884c\u548c\u76d1\u62a4\u670d\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u5730\u4e2d\u5377\u8d77\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u4e39\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u4ea4\u6613\u5458\u5c06\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002\n TP ICAP\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u6790\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7403\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u5176\u5360\u5730\u9762\u79ef\u3002\n \u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u91d1\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u5531\u7247\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u94f6\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u9053\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u4e0e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u90e8\u95e8\u957f\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5934\u75db\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u589e\u52a0\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5fc5\u987b\u5e73\u8861\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a \n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u4e3e\u63aa\u662f\u6e23\u6253\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u5355\u4f4d\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u548c\u6b27\u6d32\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u7ecf\u7eaa\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0e\u9999\u6e2f\uff06\uff0339;

Amsterdam-based Flow Traders will provide liquidity to the platform.\n TP ICAP has broadened its footprint in global capital markets by offering new data and analytics services and rolling out new products.\n Dedicated crypto funds have seen record flows this year but major banks offering access must balance growing interest with the compliance headaches long associated with the cryptocurrency sector and increasing scrutiny by regulators.   read more\n Still, the move is the latest endorsement of the sector by Standard Chartered, whose venture capital unit said earlier this month it will set up a separate crypto brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, with Hong Kong&#39;s BC Technology Group  (0863.HK).   read more\n &#34;Investor interest in this new asset class has exploded dramatically in the last six to eight months,&#34; Duncan Trenholme, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP, told Reuters. &#34;In most of our conversations with clients, they want a separation of custodial roles from execution capabilities which is opposite to the models that exist currently.&#34;\n TP ICAP launched bitcoin futures and options on CME in 2019 and now plans to launch other derivative products including total return swaps and non-deliverable forwards.\n The platform is awaiting approval by Britain&#39;s financial regulator. Neither Standard Chartered nor Fidelity Investments have invested in the platform, TP ICAP said.\n (This story refiles to add dropped letters to name in headline, 9th and 11th paragraphs)",

One of the most revealing bits of its story? It\u2019s a route to monetization as a then rare edtech consumer business based outside of Silicon Valley. The company has had a somewhat circuitous journey \u2014 full of trial and error \u2014 on finding the perfect business model. It eventually landed on subscriptions, despite an original distaste for it thanks to its mission to provide free education.\n   The vast majority of Duolingo\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions. In the most recent calendar year, for example, the edtech giant generated 73% of its total top line from subscription incomes. That revenue was followed by advertising incomes and the Duolingo English Test (DET), which represented 17% and 10% of its top line in 2020. (Notably, von Ahn hoped that  the DET would be 20% of Duolingo\u2019s revenue by 2019, a figure that it failed to reach by some margin.)\n  Its multi-part business model appears to be paying off. The company\u2019s revenue grew from $70.8 million in 2019 to $161.7 million in 2020, a 129% increase. Of course some of that growth would have happened sans the recent global pandemic, but it\u2019s not hard to see some COVID-related acceleration in the figures. Duolingo also reported $55.4 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2021, representing a 97% growth from the year-ago period.\n  But in more strict accounting terms, net losses have grown for Duolingo. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, for example, the company had net losses of 13.5 million, a sharp increase compared to the same period last year when it had net losses of $2.2 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s GAAP net losses expanded from $13.6 million to $15.8 million.\n It should be noted that the company\u2019s net margin improved in 2020, as its revenue more than doubled and its losses barely crept higher. The company\u2019s profitability or lack thereof should not prove to be a problem during its impending listing.\n In its S-1 filing, Duolingo provided a placeholder $100 million figure for the funds it expects to raise; we\u2019ll get a better idea of how much capital the edtech unicorn may onboard during its IPO when it sets an IPO price range after its roadshow.\n The former startup is effectively the kick-off to the Q3 2021 IPO season, one that several inventors have told TechCrunch will be more than active.\n Duolingo has raised $183.3 million in venture capital to date. Investors that have meaningful stakes in the company include NewView Capital, Union Square Ventures, CapitalG, Kleiner Perkins, and General Atlantic, which  recently got a spot on the cap table through a secondary transaction.\n At a run rate of around $220 million today and growth of more than 100%, Duolingo should not have a problem clearing its privately set $2.4 billion price tag. Unless public-market investors are concerned that the edtech market\u2019s growth is mostly behind it. That Duolingo grew by nearly 100% in the first quarter could temper such concerns.\n   TechCrunch is still digging its way through Duolingo\u2019s IPO filing, but we\u2019ve found a number of details that add more than a little color to its recent growth and business results. Here are some standouts:\n A \u201crecord low\u201d attrition rate in 2020 in which only four employees, or 2% of its workforce left the company.\n The company eventually plans to launch a \u201cDuolingo Proficiency Score\u201d across its offered languages, with the hopes of creating a \u201cwidely accepted indicator of language proficiency level and make Duolingo a global proficiency standard.\u201d\n It cited Apple\u2019s \u201cTranslate\u201d tool, an iOS app launched in 2020 that allows users to translate text sentences or speech between several languages, as a competitor in the \u2018risk factors\u2019 section.\n And finally,  it confirmed that it is seeking potential acquisition candidates to add complementary services to its startup.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:14:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6587\u4ef6,revenue,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u6587\u4ef6\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fdIPO\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e862020\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e86129\uff05\uff0c\u5e76\u57282021\u5b63\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\u4e8655.4\u7c73\u7684\u6536\u5165 ", "title_en": "Duolingo files for US IPO, reveals revenue growth of 129% YoY in 2020, and reports $55.4M in revenue during Q1 2021", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u6587\u4ef6", "revenue", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dbc11a87287f30bad92adbdda938a83e.jpeg", "infoid": 1068544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60e0\u666e\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4eadAero 13\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339; S\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u5f0f\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u3002\u8be5\u5668\u4ef6\u91cd\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e00\u5343\u514b\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5ea7\u4ead\u5b50\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u5177\u670990\uff05\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u5230\u8eab\u4f53\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u3002\n 13.3\u82f1\u5bf8\u673a\u5668\u5177\u67092.5K\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff0c16:10\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\uff0c400\u4e2a\u4eae\u5ea6\u548c100\uff05\u7684SRGB\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u3002 Pavilion Aero 13\u5177\u6709WiFi 6\u652f\u6301\u548cAI\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u8bdd\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u7d22\u8d54\u60a8\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u5145\u7535\u8fbe\u523010.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u7531AMD Ryzen 5000\u7cfb\u5217\u5904\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5185\u7f6eRadeon Graphics\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u8fbeRyzen 7 5800U\u3002\n   Pavillion Aero 13\u7531\u6d88\u8d39\u540e\u518d\u751f\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u6210\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u6027\u6d82\u6599\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53f0\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u662fEPEAT\u91d1\u724c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4e4b\u661f\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62e5\u6709\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684PC\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4e8e7\u6708\u4efd\u901a\u8fc7HP.com\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5b83\u59cb\u4e8e749\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; ll\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u79cb\u5929\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u6361\u8d77\u6765\u3002\n  \u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60e0\u666e\u5c06\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e3a\u5176M\u7cfb\u5217\u663e\u793a\u5668\u9635\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u6b21\u8865\u5145\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728CES\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u6761\u7ebf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Eyesafe\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0cHP\u7d22\u8d54\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u84dd\u8272\u5149\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u989c\u8272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u6536\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u9020\u7684\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u5305\u62ec24\u548c27\u82f1\u5bf8\u578b\u53f7\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u97f3\u9891\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; 7\u6708\u4efd\u53ef\u7528\uff0c24\u82f1\u5bf8\u663e\u793a\u5668\u8d77\u4ef7\u4e3a230\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u51e1\u4eba\u552e\u4ef7\u4e3a290\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n   ENGADGET\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u7531\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u56e2\u961f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6545\u4e8b\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u8054\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002\n   \u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u66f4\u65b0\u60a8\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u3002 ", "note_en": "HP has unveiled the Pavilion Aero 13, which is the company&#39;s lightest consumer laptop yet.
