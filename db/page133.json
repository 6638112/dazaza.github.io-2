control laws \u2014 and prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws.\n  Gov. Mike Parson signed  the bill, known as HB 85 or the Second Amendment Preservation Act,  into law Saturday at a gun store and shooting range called Frontier Justice.\n  The law declares federal laws and regulations &#34;that infringe on the people&#39;s right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment ... must be invalid in this state.&#34;\n  Parson, a Republican,  said in a press release that the legislation &#34;draws a line in the sand and demonstrates our commitment to reject any attempt by the federal government to circumvent the fundamental right Missourians have to keep and bear arms to protect themselves and their property.&#34;\n      &#34;They can pass a law that says that there are 46 planets, they can pass a law that says that there are 16 days in the week. It doesn&#39;t make it so,&#34; says  Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on federal courts and constitutional law. &#34;It has no effect legally because the Constitution specifically says you can&#39;t do that.&#34;\n    &#34;If I am a resident of Missouri, I am no less subject to federal gun laws today than I was yesterday,&#34; Vladeck tells NPR.\n    The U.S. Constitution&#39;s  Supremacy Clause essentially says federal law is supreme over state law. And  the preemption doctrine means that &#34;valid federal law will always displace a state law, even a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with that federal law,&#34; Vladeck says.\n  He notes that after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, some states passed laws that said the ACA wouldn&#39;t apply in those states. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the ACA from being the law of the land in every state.\n  So, what sort of federal gun laws are there? There are limits on what kinds of guns you can sell across state lines, and limits on what kind of guns and accessories can be sold in the first place. There are federal background check requirements. One provision  bans the possession of firearms by individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And there are laws governing the process and substance of gun sales, Vladeck says.\n  The new law doesn&#39;t change the liability of people in Missouri or exempt them from federal laws. So if you&#39;re a Missouri gun shop owner, you&#39;re still required to uphold federal background check requirements and other federal laws, even if the governor suggests otherwise.\n    Vladeck views Missouri&#39;s new law as symbolic public relations stunt. But he says it&#39;s symbolism that can be harmful: &#34;You run the risk that the state officials are actually sending a message to their constituents that is just incorrect, and that is exposing them to legal liability that they may not otherwise realize.&#34;\n  &#34;A Missouri gun store that thinks all of a sudden it can stop complying with federal law is going to receive a pretty unpleasant visit from federal authorities,&#34; Vladeck says.\n      While states can&#39;t invalidate federal law, they  can decide the extent to which they assist federal law enforcement.\n  &#34;Under the 10th Amendment, states do have the right to withhold the use of their resources to enforce federal laws,&#34; says  Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n  &#34;We&#39;re just simply saying we&#39;re not going to lift a finger to enforce their rules,&#34; Missouri state Sen. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said of the bill last month,  according to  The Kansas City (Mo.) Star.\n  In addition to claiming to invalidate federal gun laws, Missouri&#39;s new law prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws. Agencies whose officers knowingly enforce federal gun laws could be hit with fines of $50,000 for each violating officer.\n  State and local officers are not usually tasked with going out and enforcing federal law, Vladeck says \u2013 usually it happens in an ancillary fashion: &#34;If they&#39;re conducting a search of a home because of probable cause of a state crime, they might also find evidence of a federal crime that they&#39;ll refer to federal authorities.&#34;\n  Whether local law enforcement in Missouri will do that when it comes to guns is now in question.\n  The Department of Justice sent a letter on Wednesday night to Parson and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, warning that the state&#39;s law could damage the working relationship between local and federal authorities, The Associated Press  reported. Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton asked Parson and Schmitt to clarify the law and how it would work by Friday.\n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the accuracy of the AP&#39;s report. NPR has not viewed the letter.\n  NPR asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whether the statute would have an impact on its enforcement in the state, but an ATF spokesperson said the agency does not comment on local or state firearms law.\n    Missouri has one of the country&#39;s  highest rates of gun deaths per capita, and  weak gun control laws.\n  The law could have a chilling effect on law enforcement officers&#39; actions when it comes to guns, even if its provisions are unconstitutional and confusing, Anderman says.\n  &#34;There is a tremendous amount of ambiguity in this bill as to what would constitute a violation, and that may inhibit law enforcement from taking action that is needed to protect the community,&#34; she tells NPR.\n  Say an officer encounters someone who has a felony conviction and is in possession of a firearm?\n  &#34;They may not refer that case to federal law enforcement out of fear that they would be liable for a $50,000 fine. And that in turn can result in lack of prosecution of a law that is intended to keep guns out of the hands of people who have committed society&#39;s most serious crimes,&#34; Anderman says.\n  The state is not alone in considering this kind of legislation. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson  said in April he would sign a similar bill approved by the Legislature there.\n  Other states are considering legislation to nullify federal gun laws. But Missouri&#39;s law, Anderman says, will have real-life consequences \u2014 whether or not any law enforcement officers are actually prosecuted and fined.\n  &#34;How many officers have failed to take some action that they might have otherwise taken because of this law? We will likely never know the answer,&#34; she says, &#34;but it&#39;s the deterrent effect that is so concerning.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:07:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as \u201cchronically overlooked\u201d and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don\u2019t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.\n Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered \u201cthe common heritage of mankind.\u201d This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.\n  Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris, such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not entirely understood; however, it\u2019s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that, collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium, a metal that\u2019s even rarer than the rare earths.\n The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard Hughes\u2014the Hughes Glomar Explorer\u2014anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A., which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist, a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise to \u201cstanding on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.\u201d\n After the Glomar expeditions, interest in seabed mining waned. It\u2019s now waxing again. As one recent report put it, \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild west.\u201d Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area. Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial mining could be issued within a few years.\n Proponents of deep-sea mining argue that the sooner it starts the better. Manufacturing wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film solar panels.) \u201cThe reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,\u201d Gerard Barron, the chairman of the\u00a0Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, \u201coffer a way to dramatically reduce\u201d the environmental impact of extracting these tons.\n  But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme. There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.\n Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of \u201c Below the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea\u201d (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college, she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated. This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes, blocking her retinas. \u201cMy visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses of meaningless light,\u201d she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she no longer took sight for granted.\n \u201cWe believe we see the world as it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We see the world as we need to see it to make our existence possible.\u201d\n The same goes for fish. Only the\u00a0top layers of the oceans are illuminated. The \u201csunlight zone\u201d extends down about seven hundred feet, the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d down another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that\u2014in the \u201cmidnight zone,\u201d\u00a0the \u201cabyssal zone,\u201d and the \u201chadal zone\u201d\u2014there\u2019s only blackness, and the light created by life itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence that Widder estimates they constitute a \u201cmajority of the creatures on the planet.\u201d The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a  , she was overwhelmed by the display. \u201cThis was a light extravaganza unlike anything I could have imagined,\u201d she writes. \u201cAfterwards, when asked to describe what I had seen, I blurted, \u2018It\u2019s like the Fourth of July down there!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases, oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that\u00a0bioluminescence has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But, Widder points out, \u201cthere is one remarkable distinction.\u201d All animals\u2019 eyes employ the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins. In the case of\u00a0bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.\n The most obvious reason to flash a light in the dark is to find food. Some animals, like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye, use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.\n Bioluminescence also serves less straightforward functions. It can be used to entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean, spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it\u2019s believed, distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent slime\u2014the marks make them targets for other predators\u2014and some use bioluminescence as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it\u2019s used in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the light filtering down from above.\n Since it\u2019s so hard for humans to get to  the deep sea\u2014and, once there, to record what they\u2019re seeing\u2014Widder has spent much of her career trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She\u2019s developed special deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can\u2019t detect. Much of \u201cBelow the Edge of Darkness\u201d is occupied with the travails of getting these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to die,\u201d and in the last \u201cyou\u2019re\u00a0afraid you\u2019re not.\u201d\n  The experience that she really wants to convey, though, is not queasiness but wonder. The creatures of the deep have been putting on the world\u2019s greatest\u00a0light show for tens of millions of years. Widder thinks that if people could witness this spectacle\u2014or even just be made aware of it\u2014they\u2019d pay a lot more attention to life at the bottom of the seas and the many hazards that threaten it. These include but are not limited to global\u00a0warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, agricultural runoff, oil spills, invasive species, bottom trawling, plastic waste, and seabed mining.\n  \u201cWe seem to be in a Catch-22 scenario where we haven\u2019t explored the deep ocean because we don\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable, mysterious, and wondrous place it is, and we don\u2019t know what an astonishing place it is because we haven\u2019t explored it,\u201d she argues. Meanwhile, she writes, \u201cwe are managing to destroy the ocean before we even know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n All marine photosynthesis takes place in the sunlight zone. Beneath that, food is in such short supply that the occasional dead whale that falls to the ocean floor represents a major source of nutrients. Nevertheless, even in the farthest recesses of the oceans, life finds a way.\n The Mariana snailfish, as its name suggests, occupies the Mariana Trench\u2014the ocean\u2019s deepest depression\u2014in the western Pacific. It\u2019s a few inches long\u00a0and looks like a large, pale-pink tadpole. The Mariana snailfish has been found more than twenty-six thousand feet below sea level, where the pressure is eight hundred times greater than at the surface. To survive under such conditions, the snailfish has come up with various ingenious adaptations: its skull is not completely closed, its bones are unusually rubbery, and it produces special chemicals to prevent its proteins from denaturing under stress. The creature can barely see and instead relies on fluid-filled chambers along its jaws, which detect the movements of small crustaceans known as amphipods. Amphipods, for their part, have been collected from the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost thirty-six thousand feet down, where the pressure is so great that the animals\u2019 shells, in theory at least, should dissolve. A team of Japanese scientists recently reported that one deep-dwelling amphipod,  Hirondellea gigas, protects its shell by coating it in an aluminum-based gel, produced from metal that it extracts from seafloor mud.\n  Some of the seas\u2019 most extraordinary animals live around hydrothermal vents\u2014the oceanic equivalents of hot springs. Through cracks in the seafloor, water comes in contact with the earth\u2019s magma; the process leaves it superheated and loaded with dissolved minerals. (At some vents, the water reaches a temperature of more than seven hundred degrees.) As the water rises and cools, the minerals precipitate out to form crenellated, castlelike structures. Hydrothermal vents had been theorized about for many years but remained unseen until 1977, when a team of geologists and geochemists travelling on a research vessel called the Knorr located one about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of the Gal\u00e1pagos. A pair of scientists went down to take a look at it in a submersible named Alvin.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?\u201d one of them asked over Alvin\u2019s phone link.\n   As Helen Scales, a British marine biologist, explains in her new book, \u201c The Brilliant Abyss: Exploring the Majestic Hidden Life of the Deep Ocean, and the Looming Threat That Imperils It\u201d (Grove Atlantic), \u201cthese animals\u201d turned out to be fundamentally different from other creatures. At the bottom of the vents\u2019 food chains are microbes that have come up with their own novel survival strategy. Instead of using photosynthesis, which harnesses the energy of photons, they rely on chemosynthesis, which uses the energy stored in chemical bonds. Since the late nineteen-seventies, Scales reports, researchers have catalogued hundreds of strange species living around vents; they include creatures so puzzling that it\u2019s hard to find a limb for them on the tree of life.\n Yeti crabs, first observed in 2005 on a vent system along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island, look like hairy white lobsters. Their \u201chairs\u201d are actually extensions of their shells, and along them live colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria, which the crabs scrape up and consume. Yeti crabs were found to be so evolutionarily distinctive that taxonomists had to create not just a new genus but a whole new family for them.\n Xenoturbella profunda is a creature that looks like a discarded tube sock. First collected from a vent system in the Gulf of California in 2015, it has no intestines or central nervous system, and scientists aren\u2019t even sure what phylum it belongs to.  Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly referred to as the scaly-foot snail, is a mollusk that\u2019s been found at vents in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of ten thousand feet. It\u2019s the only animal known to build its shell with iron, and around its foot it sports a fringe of iron plates that looks a bit like a flamenco skirt. The snail carries around chemosynthesizing microbes in a special pouch in its throat. In 2019,  Chrysomallon squamiferum became the first vent-dwelling creature to be included on the Red List of Threatened Species, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale for the listing is that the species has been found at only three sites, and two of these are being explored for mining. Its living space, the I.U.C.N. has observed, is thus apt to be \u201cseverely reduced or destroyed.\u201d\n Scales, like Widder, worries that the bottom of the ocean will be wrecked before many of the most marvellous creatures living there are even identified. \u201cThe frontier story has always been one of destruction and loss,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to assume that the process would play out any differently in the deep.\u201d Indeed, she argues, the depths are particularly ill-suited to disturbance because, owing to a scarcity of food, creatures tend to grow and reproduce extremely slowly. \u201cVital habitat is created by corals and sponges that live for millennia,\u201d she writes.\n If deep-sea mining proceeds, it\u2019s likely that one of the first countries to pursue it will be Nauru, a tiny nation that, as it happens, was itself almost destroyed by mining.\n About the size of Block Island, Nauru sits in the South Pacific, about sixteen hundred miles northeast of Papua New Guinea. For thousands of years, the island\u2019s largest visitors were birds, which used it, in the words of one journalist, as a \u201cglorified rest stop.\u201d Polynesians and Micronesians arrived on the island sometime around 1000 B.C. They seem to have lived harmoniously\u2014even idyllically\u2014until gun-toting Europeans showed up, in the early nineteenth century. At the start of the twentieth century, a New Zealander named Albert Ellis realized that the ancient bird droppings that coated the island were a rich source of phosphate, an important fertilizer. During the next six decades, more than thirty-five million tons of phosphate were dug out of Nauru and shipped off to farms in Europe and Australia. The process stripped much of the island bare, leaving nothing but jagged pillars of limestone sticking out of the ground. A  National Geographic photographer who visited Nauru mid-destruction wrote, \u201cA worked-out phosphate field is a dismal, ghastly tract.\u201d\n  In 1968, Nauru became its own country. The phosphate business was still booming, and, on paper, the island\u2019s ten thousand residents became some of the richest people in the world. The new nation used its sovereign wealth to invest in, among other things, cruise ships, airplanes, overseas office buildings, and a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The musical flopped, as did most of the other ventures. Nauruans \u201chave a long history of being taken to the cleaners by crooks\u201d is how Helen Hughes, an Australian economist, put it. In 2001, in return for various fees and payments, Nauru\u2019s government allowed Australia to set up a detention center for refugees on the island. The center soon became infamous for its grim conditions.\n  Today, with the phosphate mostly mined out and the refugees mostly resettled, Nauru is betting on nodules. To engage in deep-sea exploration and mining, a company must be sponsored by a country that\u2019s party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. (The U.S. is one of the few nations that has not ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, because of conservative opposition in the Senate.) Nauru has teamed up with the Metals Company, which is based in Canada, to explore a region of the Pacific known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, west of Mexico. \u201cWe are proud that Pacific nations have been leaders in the deep-sea minerals industry,\u201d a statement co-authored by Nauru\u2019s representative to the International Seabed Authority recently declared. The deal, it\u2019s estimated, could eventually bring the country more than a hundred million dollars a year. Alternatively, the arrangement could prove even more disastrous than the da Vinci musical. At one point, Nauru officials expressed concern to the I.S.A. that, if a sponsoring nation were held liable for damages arising from a mining operation, it could \u201cface losing more than it actually has.\u201d\n The I.S.A., for its part, has been assigned the task not just of issuing the permits for seabed mining but also of drafting the regulations to govern the practice. These regulations have yet to be finalized, so it\u2019s unclear how stringent they will be. (The final rules are supposed to be in place before commercial mining commences, though the Metals Company has threatened to try to start without them.) Many marine scientists argue that because deep-sea ecosystems are so fragile\u2014and operations that are miles below the surface so difficult to monitor\u2014the only safe way to proceed is not to. Scales makes this point, but acknowledges that the I.S.A. is unlikely to be swayed. She quotes Daniel Jones, a researcher at the British National Oceanography Centre, who says, \u201cEven if we found unicorns living on the seafloor, I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop mining.\u201d Meanwhile, assuming that mining does go forward, it\u2019s been suggested that faux nodules could be manufactured and dropped by ship into the deep ocean, to replace those being refashioned into batteries. The perfect vessel for this task would have been the Glomar; unfortunately, a few years ago it was sold for scrap.\u00a0\u2666\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u4ef7,sea,\u6d77\u6d0b", "title": "\u6df1\u6d77\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u5b9d\u85cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, but It Comes at a Price", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u4ef7", "sea", "\u6d77\u6d0b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "19f86dc46c81190c889c0518b49a1388.jpg", "infoid": 1066636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u53f6\u5b50\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\u65b0\u8d44\u91d12300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800cGeekwire\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u5927\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u770b\u5230\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u8f93\u6db2\u5c31\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n \u542f\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u9500\u552e\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\u53f6\u5b50\u4e5f\u7528\u4f5c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u67091.2\u4ebf\u4eba\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\n \u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u7684160\u4eba\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u88c1\u5458\u3002\n   2020\u5e741\u6708\uff0c\u53f6\u5b50\u524a\u51cf\u4e8618\uff05\u7684\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u621654\u4e2a\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCeo-Ceo\u8482\u6885\u5229\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u201c\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5927\u9ebb\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u73b0\u5b9e\u201d\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u524a\u51cf\u4e8691\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\n \u53f6\u5b50\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Yoko Miyashita\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u524d\u76d6\u8482\u56fe\u7247Exec\uff0c\u66fe\u57282019\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5f8b\u5e08\u3002\n \u83b1\u65af\u5229\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u4e0d\u5230\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aexec\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u751f\u6839\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\n   \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u9ebb\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u8ba2\u9605\u8d39\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5e02\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002 \n\u6839\u636e\u5927\u9ebb\u56fd\u5bb6\u7a0e\u6536\u548c\u6536\u5165\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u884c\u4e1a\u57282020\u5e74\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\u4e8671\uff05\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7ea6183\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u53f6\u8302\u76db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u71c3\u6599\u8425\u9500\u5728\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\n \u5a31\u4e50\u5927\u9ebb\u4e3a16\u4e2a\u5dde\u548c\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5408\u6cd5\u3002 Medical Marijuana\u5728\u989d\u5916\u768420\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\u636eInsider\u79f0\uff0c\u4eca\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u9505\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f17\u5409\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u7684\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5747\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u6f6e\u6d41 -

The fresh cash infusion comes as the cannabis market sees an increase in sales as more states legalize pot and dispensaries were declared essential businesses during the pandemic.\n The startup plans to expand its online marketplace that lets customers and retailers buy and sell cannabis. Leafly also serves as  an educational resource. The platform has 120 million annual visitors.\n The funding will be used to add to the company\u2019s 160-person workforce and follows a series of layoffs over the past few years.\n   In January 2020, Leafly   cut 18%  of its staff, or 54 positions, which then-CEO  Tim Leslie attributed to \u201cmarket realities of the technology and cannabis sectors.\u201d It   cut 91 more employees two months later , citing the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Leafly is currently under the leadership of CEO  Yoko Miyashita, a former Getty Images exec who was previously the company\u2019s   general counsel after joining in 2019 .\n Leslie, a former Amazon exec who was Leafly\u2019s CEO for less than two years, is now a founder of a farming nonprofit called Living Roots.\n   The company\u2019s  revenue primarily comes from a monthly subscription fee paid by cannabis retailers to be listed on the platform and to access e-commerce tools. It also makes money from advertising.\n The cannabis industry saw a 71% increase in sales in 2020, according to   Leafly\u2019s report  based on marijuana state tax and revenue records. Americans spent about $18.3 billion on cannabis products last year.\n Leafly said marijuana legalization trends are accelerating the cannabis market. The company will use the new funding to fuel marketing on the east coast, where several states have legalized marijuana recently.\n Recreational marijuana is legal for adults in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana is legal in an additional 20 more. Some of these changes were made this year, with New York legalizing pot on March 31, and both Virginia and New Mexico passing similar legislation, which will take effect this summer, according to   Insider .\n  Other companies are responding to the trend \u2014 tech-giant Amazon just announced it would   stop screening certain job applicants for drug use , and it   backed federal legislation  that would legalize and decriminalize pot.\n Investors are also getting on the cannabis boom.  Dutchie , an Oregon-based cannabis e-commerce platform,   announced $200 million in new funding  in March. The company was valued at $1.7 billion.\n  Leafly has raised $38 million in total funding. The recent round was led primarily by existing investors, but Leafly didn\u2019t disclose specific firms or individuals.\n  That means seed stage investing \u2014 an average of 30% of their initial investments are in seed stage companies.\n What goes into the process of securing seed funding?

Along with Ancestry, it has helped pioneer the idea that genetic testing is not just a medical field, but a big consumer business. Its at-home testing kits, which allowed people to learn about their genetic profiles and ancestry by sending a bit of saliva through the mail, ushered in a new era of personalized medicine, though not without controversy.\n 23andMe, a five-time  CNBC Disruptor 50 company, has not had a straight or sure path to success as a public company.\n It faced FDA scrutiny earlier in its history; continues to face questions about consumer privacy as it gathers genetic information on millions of individuals; ran into financial challenges in recent years as the market for personalized genetic tests seemed to get saturated; skepticism over the basis for its gene-based risk analysis remains contentious; and as it dives deeper into drug development, a gap in its current customer base and underlying genetic data between a majority European genetic profile and underrepresentation of many minority and ethnic groups.\n &#34;It will take time ... really making sure we are getting all communities to participate in research,&#34; Wojcicki said in an interview with CNBC&#39;s &#34;TechCheck&#34; on Thursday morning. &#34;You can&#39;t make discoveries in a population if you don&#39;t have those people participating. We need the right customers and to represent the product back to them in the right way.&#34;\n  Wojcicki says the company sees big things ahead for both its consumer and drug research &amp; development platforms. Roughly 80% of 23andMe&#39;s now-11 million members opt into sharing their genetic information (de-identified) for research in drug development.\n &#34;Our genetics represent all of life on this planet, and we have the opportunity to understand what it means and with that, it will improve your own life but also contribute to all kinds of research discoveries,&#34; Wojcicki said.\n She says the controversy over the medical utility of the information when put in the hands of consumers won&#39;t go away, and it ranges on a spectrum from critical, clinical information, such as mutations in the gene that causes breast cancer, BRCA, to &#34;more controversial&#34; genetic information on Alzheimer&#39;s Disease variants. Some individuals with higher risk of blood clots make the decision to walk around more during plane flights as a result of their 23andMe reports.\n But she added that consumers have shown they want this information to help them make decisions.\n She said in the case of Alzheimer&#39;s risk, &#34;This information ... really influences how they live their life ... how they plan to retire ... plan to be older.&#34;\n Her own 10-year-old son used the company&#39;s lactose intolerance analysis to diagnose his stomach aches and Wojcicki herself, while reticent to discuss her personal use of the product, did say as the daughter of a woman who suffered from breast cancer and who has a higher risk of the disease, the information does influence her decision on having that &#34;recreational glass of wine.&#34;\n &#34;The last 15 years was putting together the infrastructure for how we can take off, proving to consumers we can get the information and proving they can understand it without a medical professional,&#34; she said.\n She says the key to its future is that consumers want to use the information to not only change their life but contribute to drug discovery.\n  &#34;We want them to truly have a personalized health-care experience and ... benefit the human genome from seeing all of this aggregated data turned into therapeutic programs,&#34; Wojcicki said. &#34;When I think about the future of therapeutics, in the next five years it is really about moving these programs forward and getting them into the clinic.&#34;\n The company also recently launched a subscription product to introduce more content and services for consumers who want to take additional steps after their genetic reports.\n &#34;We get thousands of people who call every week to the customer care team who would like to know how to use this information and apply it to live a healthier longer life,&#34; she said.\n The IPO market has already set an  annual record for deal volume in 2021, at $171 billion, and only halfway through the year. Average first day trade gains in deals this year have been above 40%. Though both traditional IPO market and SPAC returns have cooled off in recent months, with the Renaissance IPO ETF and the CNBC SPAC Index negative year-to-date after starting 2021 with a continuation of last year&#39;s big gains. Meanwhile,  concerns about SPAC deals have mounted and some high-profile SPACs like Branson&#39;s Virgin Galactic and electric vehicle maker Lordstown Motors have shown high levels of volatility.\n Nevertheless, Branson and other investors are  planning to bring another space business public, satellite internet service Virgin Orbit, via a SPAC in the weeks ahead.\n This story has been updated for the company&#39;s closing price in its first day of trading on Thursday.\n SIGN UP\u00a0 for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the list, offering a closer look at CNBC Disruptor 50

", "note_en": "I\u2019ve written before about my time at  Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the late 1990s, working on  a disastrous incentive program to build Alpha workstations. This one is another tale of Digital, but for it we need to go back a decade earlier. Back to 1986 when I joined the company, fresh out of college.\n I grew up in the late 70s/early 80s, idolizing DEC. It was the cool computer tech company that had produced the  PDP-8 mini, which I learned to program on, and later the  VAX 11/780, which I had used in some of my earliest computer courses I took while still in high school. Thinking they were the best computer company may have been  primacy bias on my part, perhaps. But there was no debating that Digital was a dominant force in the market, holding the number two computer manufacturer spot, behind IBM, and a desirable place for a new engineer to work.\n But by the time I was a Senior in college, it was strangely not I that went looking for a job at DEC; it was DEC that found me. I had in fact \u201cuneven\u201d grades let\u2019s say, and I was really just searching to find a job of any sort, as graduation neared. As fate would have it though, a school alumni who worked at Digital came by, looking for a college hire. The professor who\u2019s lab I worked in recommended me, and the next thing you know, I was renting my first car, to drive out to Shrewsbury, Massachusetts for an interview.\n I was worried about having to explain some of my grades, but the subject, luckily, never came up. They asked a few digital logic questions which I could definitely handle, and they were very interested in my senior design project, a microprocessor-based LAN/router I had built that later won best project at the school that year. (Having that project to talk about was definitely a lifesaver and welcome distraction from explaining my calculus woes!)\n They made me an offer the next day, and there was absolutely no debate in my head about taking it. So I went to work at my dream company, and I still remember the feeling of walking into work on day one and seeing my office and name plate, with brand new  VAXcluster-connected  VT100 terminal of my own ready for me, and thinking  \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m working for Digital!\u201d\n I got an apartment about a mile down the road from the plant, but on day one in ESD, I learned that my assigned project was actually going to be at the office in Littleton, Massachusetts, 25 miles to the north. DEC of the day was this giant, spreading organism with offices sprouting up on an almost weekly basis in one town or another in the western suburbs of Boston. Inter-office hopping was common, and DEC would pay mileage for people who had to travel, and even had a fleet of helicopters to shuttle people around.\n Our ESD division in Shrewsbury had the job of designing the memory systems (dynamic ram) for all of DEC\u2019s products. My group worked on the main memory systems for VAX mainframes, which at the time were very complex beasts with a lot of specialized hardware for controlling things like interleaving, error detection and correction, self-test diagnostics, and ram refresh handling.\n  Later as computers became smaller, a lot of this specialized memory hardware was either not needed, or incorporated into ICs, and memory systems for computers in general became a commodity. By the time of my adventures in the Alpha workstations group in the 90\u2019s, there would no longer be a centralized storage group at DEC, for memory design anyway, and this idea that hardware could become a commodity had stuck in my head and was pushing me to (eventually) move to a software career.\n 1986 was a different matter. Our ESD group then was busy working on many products across the company, including several very large and as it turns out, competing mainframe designs. I would drive up to Littleton every day to work on my assigned product, which was a new VAX mainframe code-named \u201cArgonaut\u201d. This was to be a third-generation offering from the Midrange Systems Business (MSB) division of DEC, which had previously designed and built the  VAX 8800 series.\n The target market for the MSB group was medium-sized businesses: bigger than a mom-and-pop shop with only a few employees, but not a giant multinational company. Able to afford maybe hundreds of thousands for a computer, but not millions. This was a huge, growing market, and a host of minicomputer companies were playing in it, like  Data General,  Apollo, and  Prime Computer. But the big concern on everyone\u2019s minds in the various hardware groups around DEC was almost always \u201cBig Blue\u201d \u2014 IBM.\n  I don\u2019t remember having a lot of discussions about our competition, but there was a de-facto attitude among the engineers I hung out with anyway that the other minicomputer companies, such as Data General and Apollo, were just copycat wannabes \u2014 never able to match Digitals accomplishments, and not really a threat. IBM though held a different place in the threat hierarchy for us. I would say they commanded a lot more respect, being the number one computer company, and historically a major force in the development of computer technology.\n That didn\u2019t mean we thought they were better than us though. IBM\u2019s image at DEC was one of a stuffy, slow, old-school company who\u2019s time had already come and gone. (Ironically, that was very close to being true for DEC at this point, and in fact IBM would outlive us.) IBM was business-focused, and in a seemingly over-formal, boring way. Their engineers all wore ties, we were told (not entirely true, even in 1986), where at DEC, you would be made fun of if you showed up to work first day wearing a tie, even if you were a manager.\n And so I worked in the company thinking IBM was both technically and culturally the enemy. But within the hardware groups that were building mainframe computers, IBM was also the target to be emulated, and hopefully surpassed. DEC was creating bigger and bigger systems, and the once rack-sized minicomputers of the PDP era had given way to larger, multi-cabinet setups, even within the midrange business unit that in theory was supposed to be making smaller, cheaper computers.\n I worked for over a year on Argonaut, designing memory controller chips that handled our double-bit error correction and self test pattern generation, and working on the ram array design. We had completed the chip designs and simulations, and were to the point where we were getting close to building hardware.\n It was a crazy, incredible time, and I had the good fortune to work with and learn from some very talented people there, including a few who went on to be chip design superstars.  Jim Keller and  Pete Bannon to name a couple, but if I am going to name drop, I would also need to say that I was a very junior engineer, on the periphery of things. So I rarely interacted directly with the CPU design team and did not know those guys personally too well.\n One day though I was sitting in a lab back in Shrewsbury doing going over our design specs with some techs there, and I got a call from the Littleton office. They said management had called a big meeting, and it was about the project and I needed to get back to the office right away. I got in my car and drove up immediately, but it was a short meeting and by the time I got up there, it was over. The takeaway from it was, Argonaut had been cancelled.\n I and safe to say a very large majority of people there were completely blind-sided by this, as cancellation had not been even a fleeting thought for us. We were laser-focused on completing our design, and getting it out into the battlefield against IBM. But technology problems had crept in, and the management and some of the senior technical staff there had been quietly trying to resolve a major obstacle that had cropped up with the I/O structure of the gate array chips we were using.\n For the technical, this was an issue of simultaneous switching, causing signal integrity problems. It was a big issue, the kind that would normally lead to a major project delay, and possibly some people being fired for making poor technical decisions (but honestly, at DEC we never fired anyone, we were really bad at it)\n It could have been fixed, eventually though. Cancellation should have been off the table for a project like this, since building a next-generation business mainframe was at the time, a mission-critical thing for us.\n The reason that cancellation of a year-or-more-long effort involving hundreds of engineers was feasible in the minds of DEC\u2019s upper management was this: they had another competing product under development in the company to go to.\n Fifteen miles to the south, in Marlborough, Massachusetts, sat a hulking fortress of a building that Digital called \u201cMRO1\u201d. MRO1 was a three-story concrete and glass structure, originally built in 1969 by RCA for use as factory space. It was later purchased by DEC for manufacturing use as well, but eventually converted to office space that was home to a major division of the company - High Performance Systems (HPS).\n The sprawling factory floor that had years previously built  DECSystem-20s was now a sea of cubicles for the HPS engineering staff, the sheer scale of which was beyond anything I had ever seen, or have seen since. The Argonaut engineers from the much-smaller MSB building in Littleton would fit in one corner of this giant office complex.\n  This was Digital\u2019s \u201cbig computer\u201d division, the group that was tasked with going after IBMs core business with very large, and very expensive mainframe computer designs. And if the MSB division in Littleton had IBM-envy, it was nothing compared with what was going on over in Marlborough. HPS was very much trying to be IBM, so much so that there had been a mini cultural shift from the DEC norm going on there, with managers wearing ties and a general higher level of formality of engineering processes.\n  After the cancellation of Argonaut, there was a week-long, drunken party at the house of one of the engineers, \u201cNancy\u201d, who had a place with a big back yard and an inground pool. The day they announced the news we were all in shock, and Nancy came to the rescue, inviting everyone over for an impromptu party \u2014 which was a badly needed distraction for all involved. I don\u2019t remember much of it, I think Jim Keller threw me into the pool at one point, (which may have counted as the most significant interaction we ever had.)\n  It was supposed to be a one day party, but as everyone soon found out, there was nothing to do at work. People would show up in the morning, and the management would give out stuff to read and research, like some things about MIPS architecture that we were looking into. But then everyone would just kind of leave, and we\u2019d end up at Nancy\u2019s house with suntan lotion, coolers and barbeque supplies, probably much to her dismay after two or three days.\n The party eventually ended, but things went on over the summer in the same way: you would show up to work, see if anything was going on, management would say \u201cstay tuned\u201d, and you would go home. It amazed me even then that a company would allow this to happen. There were no layoffs, no reassignments to different groups, they just let everything float for pretty much the summer. It must have cost a fortune, and I highly doubt anything would go down like this ever again in today\u2019s tech business world.\n My situation that summer was different though, owing to the fact that I was actually not part of the MSB division, but part of Electronic Storage Development. I was a centralized resource, who could be deployed on other projects easily. My managers were not about to let me have the summer off, since HPS was in the middle of their own giant mainframe project, code-named \u201cAquarius\u201d. I was reassigned to this project, which was also in the late stages of development.\n It was not an easy transition for me. Although organizationally, I worked for an outside group, I had been embedded in the MSB design team for over a year and had become quite loyal to our effort, and felt like part of the tribe. HPS to us was not a group we thought about much, but probably when we did, we lumped them into the \u201cIBM\u201d category of being a bloated, overly-formal, stuffy division.\n There was not much if any communication or technical exchange between the HPS and MSB design teams, even though we were working on very similar products. So I didn\u2019t know what, if any, transferrable knowledge I gained from working on Argonaut could be applied to working on Aquarius.\n Once I got to Marlborough, I found that the HPS engineers were much more prone to looking over their shoulders at what might be going on over at MSB, and did in fact consider the ever-larger machines coming out of that division to be a competing threat to their work. They were all quite happy Argonaut was cancelled, and the product management there expanded the Aquarius product line to include a lower-end variant, called \u201cAridus\u201d to fill in the gap left by the cancellation of our project. The whole Aquarius program had been envisioned as an \u201cIBM Killer\u201d, but its first (and spoiler, only) victim would be a product within the same company.\n And so it was very hard not to feel out of place, working in HPS \u2014 almost like I was an exchange student, or perhaps, captured prisoner. I remember listening to HPS people disparage the product group in MSB, and then ask me if the people there did the same kind of thing when talking about HPS. I was the rare guy who had been over enemy lines, and they would often ask about what things were like in MSB, as if we were talking about Russia or something. I kind of shrugged, because honestly we did not spend a lot of time in MSB thinking about them.\n Someone should have though, obviously. Today I find it ridiculous that a major corporation would allow huge groups to silo to this degree, to fail to communicate, cooperate, and share, and to allow them to build overlapping and competing products. To allow this kind of animosity to build between employees of the same company. We\u2019re talking about thousands of engineers involved here, between the two divisions. Seems like something that could have only happened in the crazy 1980\u2019s, but I am betting if enough people read this far, we will see comments to the contrary.\n This siloed competition phenomenon in fact happens a lot, and I have seen lesser versions of this play out at other, smaller companies I\u2019ve worked for. Sometimes it is just a matter of two groups colliding with each other and trying to do the same thing, or even two individuals. The common goal of beating the external competition gives way to an internal fight for control of something, fueled by lack of communication and sometimes, lack of trust.\n Maybe its too simplistic a take, but for me it all of it owes to a failure of management, somewhere in the end. Easy to say I know, and not always easily or effectively addressed, but in essence avoidable. DEC\u2019s version of this failure was just perhaps a bigger example of competitive siloing that is allowed to manifest at many companies, very often to negative effect.\n The Aquarius project for its part turned out to be a billion dollar disaster, and that doesn\u2019t even count however much money was spent on our cancelled Argonaut project. Released in 1989 as the  VAX 9000, only a few dozen were sold, despite the billion dollar development cost.\n  Much of this failure owes to technical missteps, to be clear. Aquarius was so-named because it was a water cooled system, a necessity due to the enormous power demands of the bipolar transistor, emitter-coupled logic (ECL) technology used in the system. This technology was in favor at the time due to its speed, but required exotic cooling and interconnect technology that required an army of mechanical and thermal engineers to design.\n It all would soon be eclipsed by superior CMOS chip technology, which offered good performance with much less power required. This in turn allowed chips to be scaled up in size, reducing chip counts and thus interconnect delays between chips, boosting the overall performance of the entire system.\n And to be fair - our cancelled Argonaut project also utilized ECL chip technology, so would have had similar drawbacks. In the end, the winner (within DEC anyway) in this competitive CPU design contest was neither the Littleton MSB group or the Marlborough HPS group, but what was coming out of our chip foundry in Hudson, Massachusetts. Fast VLSI CMOS processors, starting with the  microVAX chip sets but eventually leading to the high-performance Alpha chip, would soon dominate the company, eliminating CPU design groups in both MSB and HPS.\n Maybe if we had moved these mainframe projects to CMOS earlier, there would have been a way for both these projects to succeed in the marketplace, who knows. And the larger strategic issue of DEC being slow to follow the \u201csmaller, cheaper, better\u201d route that the industry pivoted to once CMOS technology matured is also a huge factor in our companies decline \u2014 and beyond the scope of this story.\n It could be that failure was just in the cards for us. When I think back on this time though, I keep returning to the idea that we would have been in a much better position somehow if these company divisions had worked together, rather than competed as rivals. (In writing this, the word \u201cdivisions\u201d in the first place seems very tell-tale.)\n Certainly the R&amp;D costs would have been lower, and maybe a cooperating set of R&amp;D groups could have come up with a better technical solution. Or if MSB had targeted a lower-end market segment with less overlap, perhaps their project would not have been cancelled, and at least on of the two projects would have succeeded in making a profit. Whatever the case, the whole combined thing had to have gone down as one of the most expensive blunders in computer development history.\n I remember in 1993, after it had become clear that Aquarius was a flop, attending an R&amp;D staff meeting in an auditorium in Digital\u2019s famous \u201cMill\u201d headquarters in Maynard, Massachusetts, where I was then working in the Alpha Workstations group. DEC\u2019s stock price had dropped, we were in the midst of a series of layoffs, and a discontented crowd had gathered to hear Jack Smith, Chief Operating Officer of the company, speak.\n Jack was not well liked by a lot of the engineering staff, and had in the past done things such as send out a memo complaining about how the parking lot at the Mill was only half full at 9AM, where in the old days it was always full. When he was not accusing people of shorting their work hours, he was green-lighting bad product decisions, like funding two largely overlapping projects that used soon-to-be-obsolete technology. I don\u2019t remember the content of the meeting, probably a pep talk of some sort, but I do remember the Q&amp;A that followed.\n A bold engineer stood up and said bluntly that the company had spent one billion dollars developing a computer that no one wanted, and that if we had instead invested in literally anything else, such as for instance McDonald\u2019s franchises, we would have made more money. Jack (who was obviously bad at reading a room, or otherwise he would not have scheduled a Q&amp;A in the first place) stood there numbly and only said:\n    Many other armchair analysists and MBA students have debated the causes of Digital\u2019s downfall, and there is probably no new ground left to cover here. And I don\u2019t know to what degree the unchecked redundancy and inter-division competition played in the failures of these mainframe projects, or of Digital in general. But do I know it certainly didn\u2019t help. For me, the memories of these projects remain as an cautionary reminder of what can happen when people in an organization fail to cooperate with each other.\n Shortly after the events of this story, Digital would close its iconic Maynard headquarters, along with many other offices in order to control costs.
