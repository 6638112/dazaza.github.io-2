They’re constantly adjusting them, fine-tuning their wishes for future medical treatment. “Like a dowager with an elaborate will,” I tease them, blowing the ink dry on yet another signature.</p><p>一旦Covid被创造出来，我的父母就会更新他们的“前进决定”文件。他们不断调整他们，微调他们对未来的医疗的愿望。 “就像一个令人作造的骗子一样，”我戏弄他们，吹掉墨水在另一个签名上。</p><p> When they first completed their advance decision document, 20 years ago, they were mostly concerned with not being resuscitated should they have a stroke, perhaps while shopping in the market or cycling home. Now, aged 84 and 82 and debilitated by multiple illnesses, they’ve had to give up their bikes and those hopes of a dramatic end. “We look like the old people road sign,” says my mum, bent over her walking aid, handing my dad his stick. And they do. Frail as leaves, they totter down the road to the vegetarian cafe: the wind could blow them away.</p><p> 20年前他们首次完成其提前决定文件的时候，他们大多关注没有被复苏，如果他们在市场上购物或骑自行车的时候。现在，年龄在84岁和82岁，并被多种疾病衰弱，他们必须放弃他们的自行车和那些希望戏剧性的人。 “我们看起来像老人的道路标志，”我的妈妈说，在她的拐杖上弯曲，递给爸爸他的棍子。他们这样做。脆弱作为叶子，他们蹒跚地走到素食咖啡馆的道路上：风可以把它们吹走。</p><p>  These days, all they really want is to avoid hospital. They hope to die at home. To that end, we have bought a hospital bed, a stair lift and adapted the bathroom. But what use is all that in the face of Covid-19, they worry: a disease, they read (for there is nothing sclerotic about their intake of news), that isn’t just lethal to them but would put everyone around them at risk? Who would nurse them if they had Covid?</p><p>  这些天，他们真正想要的只是避免医院。他们希望在家死去。为此，我们已经买了一张医院床，楼梯升降机并改编浴室。但是，在Covid-19面前的使用是什么，他们担心：疾病，他们读（因为没有什么是巩膜的内容，他们的摄入新闻），这不仅仅是对他们来说将所有人留在风险？如果他们有Covid，谁会护理他们？</p><p> “Well, me,” I say. “I’ll do it. I’m just round the corner. And, look, I’m breaking the law already, just sitting here.” (For this April is 2020 and support bubbles have not been invented yet.) “I’m not scared,” I lie. “Write it in.” So my parents write their Covid codicils: no hospital, no ventilation. Just painkillers, please.</p><p> “好吧，我，”我说。 “我会做的。我只是围着拐角处。而且，看，我已经突破了法律，只是坐在这里。“ （对于4月份，4月2020年，支持泡沫尚未发明。）“我不害怕，”我撒谎。 “写它。”所以我的父母写了他们的Covid Codicils：没有医院，没有通风。请止痛药。</p><p> Maybe they aren’t so unusual. It turns out there is a government drive to get GPs to talk to their vulnerable patients about avoiding heroic interventions in the face of Covid. This drive quite often seems to result in outraged calls to the local radio station, but my parents are pleased when their GP rings. Shortly after, they take delivery of yet another, government-sponsored, advance decision document to fill in. This one is green and a little basic, but it comes with a special pot to keep it in the fridge and the promise that the ambulance man will always look there. My father is so pleased with this detail that he clips a folder of all the previous advance decisions to the fridge door so the paramedic will find them, too. COVID-19 the folder says, in such gothically shaky capitals that after a while my mother can’t bear the sight of it and covers it with a newspaper clipping of Nadia, the Bronx zoo tiger reported to have Covid. “Nadia got better,” she says, looking at the tiger’s dear stripy face. My mother loves cats. My mother loves many things: cooking, the radio, all children, flowers, my father. She is unremittingly hopeful, persistent as spring.</p><p> 也许他们不是那么异常。事实证明，有一个政府驱动器让GPS与弱势患者交谈，避免在Covid面前的英勇干预措施。这个驱动器经常似乎导致对当地广播电台的愤怒呼叫，但我的父母在GP戒指时感到高兴。不久之后，他们拨打另一个政府赞助的，提前决定文件填写。这一个是绿色和一点基本，但它带有一个特殊的锅，将其放在冰箱里和救护车的承诺将永远看起来。我的父亲对这种细节很满意，他将所有以前的预先决定的文件夹夹在冰箱门上，所以护理人员也会找到它们。 Covid-19这个文件夹说，在这样的哥特式摇摇欲坠的首都，经过一段时间的母亲无法看到它，并用纳迪亚的报纸剪辑覆盖它，据报道，据报道，有科迪德。 “纳迪亚变得更好，”她说，看着老虎亲爱的镶边脸。我的母亲喜欢猫。我的母亲喜欢很多东西：烹饪，收音机，所有的孩子，鲜花，我的父亲。她不懈地希望，坚持像春天。</p><p> But this spring, I sometimes think my mother is dying. The thought comes to me when she stands among the blooming blackthorn and cannot smell it, when she asks me to taste the salt in the gravy, because that sense has gone, when she suffers painful, sudden, memory lapses only I would notice, and begs me to ignore them. My mother has borne years of debilitating illness and always put her head up, bright and brave, always gone out on the street and found her solace in talking to people. But when I persuade her out in these early days of quarantine, families do elaborate shunning dances around us, pulling their little ones away. One day, a mad person spits on her coat. Another day, a neighbour sprays her with disinfectant, and reminds her to quarantine her shopping. My mother’s head goes down. She says we deserve this because we are breaking the rules when I go out with them. She won’t come to the meadow any more.</p><p> 但是这个春天，我有时会认为我的母亲正在死。当她站在盛开的黑色植物中时，这想到了我，当她要求我在肉汁中品尝盐时，因为这种感觉已经消失了，当她痛苦，突然时，记忆只有我会注意到，我会注意到请乞求我忽略它们。我的母亲已经承担了多年的衰弱的疾病，总是把她的头抬起来，明亮和勇敢，总是在街上出去，发现她的慰借与人交谈。但是当我在这些早期的检疫早期说服她时，家庭确实详细说明了我们周围的避免，把他们的小孩拉开了。有一天，一个疯狂的人吐在她的外套上。另一天，邻居用消毒剂喷洒她，并让她想起她的购物。我母亲的脑袋倒了。她说我们应该得到这个，因为当我和他们出去时我们正在违反规则。她不会再来草地。</p><p>  When my mother was an excited child on VE night, a jumping jack firework badly burned her leg. Now, as her heart flags and her legs swell and her skin, weakened from decades of steroids, cracks; ulcers and cellulitis appear in the ancient scar. I pack the holes with iodine pads, dry them with honey, take pictures of new ulcers as they appear and send them to the doctor, receive antibiotics by return from the chemist, buy Imodium and probiotics to deal with the harsh side-effects.</p><p>  当我的母亲在晚上是一个兴奋的孩子时，一个跳跃的杰克烟花厉害地烧了她的腿。现在，随着她的心脏旗帜和她的腿膨胀和她的皮肤，从数十年的类固醇，裂缝削弱;溃疡和蜂窝织炎出现在古老的疤痕中。我用碘垫打孔，用蜂蜜擦干，拍摄新溃疡的照片，因为它们出现并将其发送给医生，通过从化学家返回来接受抗生素，购买imodium和益生菌来处理苛刻的副作用。 </p><p> My dad watches, worries about his new Parkinson’s diagnosis, the dystonia in his neck, which presses his chin to his chest, his cancer, resurgent again, and always, his depression. Each day we walk the same loop round the meadow and each day he finds it longer. He talks much more than he used to about the past: his school, the brother and sister and cousin he lost when they were young. He talks – and he has never done this before – about his own father, Henry, absent on naval intelligence missions for most of his childhood. He checks I know where the advance decisions are, often, and makes me promise to remove the picture of Nadia the tiger immediately should he or Mum become ill, so the documents will be easier to find.</p><p>我父亲的父亲担心他的新帕金森的诊断，他的颈部肌肌肌肌肌肌，迫使他的下巴，他的癌症，再次复活，总是，他的抑郁症。每天我们都走在草地上的同一个环，每天都能找到更长的时间。他的谈论比习惯于过去：他的学校，兄弟姐妹和堂兄，他年轻时失去了。他谈论 - 他从来没有这样做过 - 关于他自己的父亲，亨利，缺席海军情报任务为他的大部分童年。他检查我知道在哪里，经常会在哪里，并使我承诺立即去除纳迪亚虎的照片，如果他或妈妈会生病，那么文件会更容易找到。</p><p> Amazingly, Nadia stays in place all the way till a morning in late November when my mother, who has another infection in her foot, wakes cold and unable to move. We call the doctor, who calls the ambulance, which comes so swiftly that we barely have time to pack her bags, put her advance decisions in a special folder on top of the radio and Patrick Gale novels, barely time to wrap her in her good dressing gown, comb her hair and tell her she looks beautiful, even now, because she has excellent bones, before the ambulance takes her away.</p><p> 令人惊讶的是，纳迪亚一直在11月下旬到11月下旬的早晨，当我的母亲身上有另一种感染，醒来寒冷，无法移动。我们称之为守护救护车的医生，这太迅速地带来了，我们几乎没有时间打包她的行李，把她的提前决定放在一个特殊文件夹上，在收音机顶部和帕特里克大风小说上，几乎没有时间把她包成她的好东西梳妆台，梳理她的头发，告诉她，她看起来很漂亮，即使是现在，因为她有优秀的骨头，在救护车把她带走之前。</p><p>  M y mother dreads the hospital for sound reasons. Like hospitals in general, this one is good at heroic interventions, less good at nursing care. It is an academic institution with many groundbreaking researchers, but frail elderly people with tedious, multiple conditions are not often of interest to them. When my mother had an emergency stomach bleed she was superbly treated, but when she had spine pain she was left for four nights on a trolley, and was even trundled to theatre on it at one point to have someone else’s operation (fortunately she was turned back at the door).</p><p>  M y母亲因健全的原因而害怕医院。像医院一样，这一个是善于英雄的干预，不太擅长护理。它是一个具有许多突破性的研究人员的学术机构，但脆弱的老年人有乏味，多种条件对他们来说不是兴趣。当我的母亲紧急胃流血时，她很干净，但当她脊椎疼痛时，她留下了一只小车的四个晚上，甚至在一个点上剧院，让别人的操作（幸运的是她被转身回到门口）。</p><p> Covid restrictions have redoubled this tendency. This time, she is treated with hoo-ha and drastic antibiotics for a suspected bone infection, then with multiple pills for the resultant racing heart, but when scans reveal the infection isn’t there, she is left in a ward for a while before being released without a conclusive diagnosis. Through all this, because of Covid, she has to be alone.</p><p> Covid限制已经加倍这种趋势。这一次，她用Hoo-Ha和激烈的抗生素治疗了疑似骨感染，然后用多个药片来制作赛车的心脏，但是当扫描揭示感染时不在那里，她在一个病房里留下了一段时间在没有结论性诊断的情况下被释放。通过所有这一切，因为科维德，她必须独自一人。</p><p> When she comes back home many things have gone missing: the advance decision documents, her digestion, her ability to get to the loo, her steady heartbeat, her confidence, large bits of her memory. She keeps forgetting, for example, that my father has Parkinson’s. She thinks he can bring her trays up the stairs, and he gets stuck trying, halfway up with his head hung on his chest, hands shaking, trapped in his depression, thinking of my mother in bed, bright-eyed and angry, facing off her fear with elaborate plans for lunch. I come and take the tray away and he says he wants to die.</p><p> 当她回到家时，许多事情已经失踪了：提前决定文件，她的消化，她能够到达厕所，她稳定的心跳，她的信心，她记忆大的大位。例如，她忘记了我的父亲有帕金森的。她认为他可以把她的托盘带到楼梯上，他陷入困境，他的头上挂在胸前，手摇晃着，陷入了他的萧条，思考我的母亲躺在床上，明亮的眼睛和愤怒，朝外她对精心制作的午餐计划的恐惧。我来拿走托盘，他说他想死。</p><p>  My father sees his death as a boat on a pond. “You’re just out there having a nice time,” he told me when he was first diagnosed with bladder cancer, “getting the hang of the oars, and they call in your number. Come in, number 63. A bit soon, maybe, but that’s all right.” It was soon, then: but that was 12 years ago and that cancer turned out to be containable. It’s back, but my father now neither believes it will kill him nor that it would be too soon if it did. He’s afraid nothing will be allowed to kill him. “The doctors will always think of something,” he says. “They’ll keep pumping you up, making you live.”</p><p>  我的父亲认为他的死是池塘的船。 “你只是出去玩了一个美好的时光，”当他第一次被诊断出患有膀胱癌的时候告诉我，“拖着桨，他们在你的号码中呼叫。进来，63号。可能很快，也许，但这没关系。“那很快就是：但是，这是12年前，癌症原来是可容纳的。它回来了，但我的父亲现在都不相信它会杀了他，也不会太快就会杀了他。他害怕什么都不能杀死他。 “医生总会想到一些事情，”他说。 “他们会继续抽你的，让你活着。”</p><p> In a bid to defend ourselves against the hospital, in an effort to find out where my mother’s advance decision documents might have gone, and if it matters, in a final shot at writing death a really good clear letter (always my parents’ weapon of choice) we ask the GP to come for an end-of-life meeting. Very kindly, since we are now well into the second wave of the pandemic, she attends in person, sits across the sitting room and listens. She, too, is concerned about the fate of the advance decision documents. They must have been lost in the emergency ward, probably early on in the hospital visit because the discharge notes have my mother as “for resuscitation”. The GP says she will sort this out: it’s a serious mistake.</p><p> 在一个竞标捍卫本医院，努力了解我母亲的提前决定文件可能已经消失的地方，如果它重要的话，在写死亡的最后一次射门中是一个非常好的清楚信（总是我的父母的父母武器选择）我们要求GP来实现终身会议。非常友善，因为我们现在进入大流行的第二波，她参加了一个人，坐在客厅里，听。她也担心提前决定文件的命运。他们必须在紧急情况下丢失，可能在医院访问时早期，因为排放笔记有我的母亲“用于复苏”。 GP说她会解决这个问题：这是一个严重的错误。 </p><p> We get out the original documents – there are still plenty of copies – and try to plan for the next time. I’ve heard there are community nurses who come to your home if you are dying, nurses who will give you morphine, put you on a drip, but the GP won’t confirm this. There are some alternatives, the GP says: an elderly unit, a community hospital, but you still have to call the ambulance.</p><p>我们拿出了原始文件 - 仍有很多副本 - 并尝试下次计划。我听说有社区护士如果你正在垂死，那么将给你吗啡的护士，让你滴水，但GP不会确认这一点。 GP有一些替代方案：一位老年人，一个社区医院，但你仍然要叫救护车。</p><p> It doesn’t take long. Just after Christmas, we have to call the GP about a new ulcer on my mum’s leg. A paramedic comes to look and raises concerns. He wants my mother’s heart rate measured in a day ward in the hospital. The day ward, he promises, not the emergency unit, but she goes at 11 and hasn’t come back by 4pm, so I call the day ward, and am told she never arrived. I call the switchboard: she was diverted to the emergency unit. So I call and it rings off the hook. I call the number again, and then again. I call it every two minutes until 10pm and only once is it picked up. The nurse tells me she is too busy to let me talk to anyone, there is a pandemic on, but she can see my mother across the ward, alive and on an antibiotic drip. I go to bed.</p><p> 它不需要很长时间。在圣诞节之后，我们必须在妈妈的腿上致电GP关于一个新的溃疡。护理人员来看看并提出担忧。他希望在医院的一天病房中测量母亲的心率。当天的病房，他承诺，而不是紧急单位，但她进入11次，又来下了下午4点，所以我打电话给病房，我告诉她从未到达。我打电话给交换机：她被转移到了紧急单位。所以我打电话，它响起了钩子。我再次召唤号码，然后再次调用。我每两分钟给它一次，直到晚上10点，只有一次被拿起。护士告诉我她太忙了让我与任何人交谈，有一个流行病，但她可以看到我的母亲穿过病房，活着和抗生素滴水。我去睡觉。</p><p>  A t 3.30 in the morning, I am woken by a doctor on the phone. He says my mother has developed sepsis and a galloping infection in the ulcer. They are going to operate and she may well die. I am confused, I say that she has advance medical decisions against interventions of this sort. Oh well, says the doctor, we’re working with her, and she’s happy with this. She’s very bright, very alert. And he puts the phone down. I imagine my mother, docile and smiling as she always is in fear. I remember how she agreed to go to the operation that wasn’t hers, was rolled along the corridor, bright and smiling for the doctor. I imagine her infected leg. I imagine her waking up to find it gone. I imagine it is all my fault for not sending her to hospital quickly enough. I get up, and go round to see my father. There is freezing fog that morning, and it is as if I am eating it, as if my insides were full of fog.</p><p>  早上3:30，我在手机上醒来。他说，我的母亲在溃疡中开发了败血症和疾病感染。他们会运作，她可能会死。我很困惑，我说她已经提出了对这种情况的干预措施的医学决策。哦，好吧，医生说，我们正在和她合作，她很满意。她非常明亮，非常警惕。他把电话放下了。我想象我的母亲，温顺和微笑，因为她总是在恐惧。我记得她如何同意去运作并不是她的操作，沿着走廊滚动，明亮和微笑着医生。我想象她的感染腿。我想她醒来发现它消失了。我想到了我不够快速地向医院送到医院是所有的错。我起床，然后去看我父亲。那天早上有沉闷的雾，好像我正在吃它，好像我的内部是充满了雾。</p><p> My father and I get out the advance decisions again. They are so clear. “In the event of an infection I want to avoid heroic interventions”, “I refuse treatment with a ventilator”, “I do not want my life prolonged if the alternative is permanent nursing care”. But she didn’t have those documents with her, because she was going to the day ward. She had completed full medical attorney documents for me, but I couldn’t be there to advocate for her, because of Covid. And now she has been put on a ventilator, for her operation, and when I call the ICU they say she is stuck on it, she can’t breathe on her own. They don’t know if she will ever come off it, but if she does, they say, she will live a very limited life in a nursing home. “We must hope she dies,” says my dad when I put down the phone. My parents are devout atheists: they believe there is no God and therefore we must live well. So do I. We pray.</p><p> 我的父亲和我再次出去了预付决定。他们太清楚了。 “如果发生感染我想要避免英勇的干预”，“我用呼吸机拒绝治疗”，“如果替代方案是永久护理的话，我不希望我的生命长。但她没有和她有那些文件，因为她要去天道。她为我完成了完整的医疗律师文件，但由于Covid，我不能在那里倡导她。现在她已经被戴上了呼吸机，因为她的手术，当我称之为ICU时，他们说她陷入困境，她无法呼吸自己。他们不知道她是否会脱离它，但如果她这样做，他们说，她会在养老院生活中的一个非常有限的生活。 “我们必须希望她死了，”当我放下电话时，我爸爸说。我的父母是虔诚的无神论者：他们相信没有上帝，因此我们必须活得很好。所以我祈祷。</p><p> Then I start scanning my mother’s documents and emailing them through to the ICU. It seems an especially hard thing to do just then, in January 2021: when the whole country is absorbed in the effort to save the lives of people like my parents, when the national psychodrama is focused on getting an elderly person on to a ventilator, not off it. I’m worried the doctor will think I am a murderer.</p><p> 然后我开始扫描我母亲的文件并将它们通过电子邮件发送给ICU。在2021年1月，这似乎是一个特别难以做到的事情：当整个国家都被吸收努力拯救像父母这样的人的生活，当国家精神科剧重点是让老人进入呼吸机时，没有脱离它。我担心医生会认为我是一个凶手。</p><p>  But lots of doctors believe in a good death, in fact, and want desperately to give it to their patients. Very many of them are grateful for advance decisions. The doctor in charge of my mother’s care at the ICU is certainly one of them. Over the next two days, we have long conversations about my mother’s steadily failing kidneys and steadily held wish for a peaceful death. She reassures me that she will make no more heroic interventions, that we will be allowed an end-of-life visit. Two days later, she takes my mother off the ventilator so she can die comfortably. My father and I are summoned to the ICU to bid her farewell. My mother lies on a high bed in the quiet of the ward and murmurs “love love” through her mask. It’s unbearably moving and just slightly theatrical and only one thing goes wrong: she doesn’t die.</p><p>  但很多医生都相信一个很好的死亡，其实希望迫切需要向患者提供。他们中的许多人都感谢提前决定。母亲在ICU的母亲照顾的医生当然是其中之一。在接下来的两天里，我们对母亲稳步失败的肾脏和稳步持有和平死亡的长期交谈。她向我保证，她会不会更多的英雄干预措施，我们将被允许终身访问。两天后，她把母亲从呼吸机上移开，所以她可以舒服地死去。我的父亲和我被召唤到ICU吩咐她的告别。我的母亲在宁静的病房里躺在一张高床上，通过她的面具嘀咕着“爱的爱”。这是难以忍受的动作，只是略微戏剧，只有一件事出错了：她不会死。</p><p> It’s my brother who finds this out, 24 hours later. He has broken quarantine and driven distances at dawn and begged and pleaded and sneaked himself and my father on to what he thought was the palliative ward only to find my mother breathing with just an oxygen mask, conscious, but off her head. A doctor asks my brother what sort of “cleaning help around the house” is available “when she gets home”. My brother is, understandably, wholly traumatised by all this.</p><p> 24小时后，我是我哥哥的那个兄弟。他在黎明中遭到了残疾的隔离和驱动的距离，并恳求并恳求自己，父亲依赖他的想法是姑息的病房，只有一个氧气面具，有意识，而是从她的头上找到呼吸。一位医生问我的兄弟是什么样的“房子周围的清洁帮助”是“当她回到家”时的可用。我哥哥是，可以理解，全部全部创伤。 </p><p>  T he only hope, we work out, of getting my mother out of hospital and of her seeing any of us again, is to move her and my father into a private nursing home where they can share a quarantined room. My father is willing. The hospital says it is possible. We find a nursing home that can do it. Now we have to tell her. This is hard: the hospital is in full pandemic mode and we are down to one call for information a day, carefully timed to catch a nurse. My brother and I are on a rota – if we both try to call within 24 hours, we will be told off.</p><p>他只希望，我们锻炼身体，让我的母亲从医院出来，她再次看到我们任何一个人，就是将她和我的父亲搬进私人护理家，在那里他们可以分享一个隔离房间。我父亲愿意。医院说有可能。我们找到了一个可以做到的养老院。现在我们必须告诉她。这很难：医院处于完全大流行模式，我们每天都致电信息，小心翼翼地定时捕捉护士。我的兄弟和我在rota  - 如果我们都在24小时内尝试致电，我们将被告知。</p><p> I note that one of my feelings, as I beg to know if my mother is still alive, is humiliation, and another is rage, but the dominant one is helplessness so extreme it is leading me to apathy. Versions of these feelings, I vaguely suppose, are the reason there has not been a revolutionary movement across the country to remove older people from isolation in care homes, and also why my father has stopped eating, can’t seem to taste anything and spends most of his time looking at a wall.</p><p> 我注意到我的一个感情，因为我求知道我的母亲仍然活着，是羞辱，另一个是愤怒，​​但主导是一个无助的，这是极端的，它导致我带来了冷漠。这些感受的版本，我含糊地假设，是跨越全国革命运动的原因，去除老年人免于孤立在护理家园里，而且为什么我父亲已经停止进食，似乎无法品尝任何东西和花费他的大部分时间看着墙。</p><p> On the fifth day, I am called by the hospital. It is a new, senior nurse, asking about an advance decision document. It seems that my mother has been pulling the feeding tube out of her throat and announcing that she has one. Persistently. This nurse thinks this should be listened to. She is so bright, my mum. She has her head up. I love this nurse. I send the documents off again, and the nurse makes a new arrangement: my mother is to be allowed to eat and drink for herself, whatever the risk of choking.</p><p> 在第五天，我被医院打电话。这是一个新的高级护士，询问提前决定文件。似乎我的母亲一直把饲养管拉出她的喉咙，宣布她有一个。坚持不懈。这位护士认为这应该听取。她是如此明亮，我的妈妈。她抬起头来。我喜欢这位护士。我再次送下文件，护士发出新的安排：我的母亲是被允许为自己吃饭和喝酒，无论窒息的风险如何。</p><p>  Now the tubes are out, she can speak and hold a telephone. I am allowed to talk to her and am overwhelmed to find she is still there, my beloved mother, still there the strong voice, the eager, empathic affirmation. I tell her about our nursing home plan: we are going to get her out. She will be in a room with my father, soon. She weeps. “I never thought I would be allowed such a thing,” she said. “I thought I had died. I thought you were all dead.”</p><p>  现在管道出来，她可以说话和持有电话。我被允许和她说话，我不知所措，发现她仍然存在，我心爱的母亲，仍然存在强烈的声音，渴望，异常肯定。我告诉她关于我们的护理家庭计划：我们将会让她出去。很快，她将和父亲在一个房间里。她哭了。 “我从未想过我会允许这样的事情，”她说。 “我以为我已经死了。我以为你们都死了。“</p><p> But of course she is not to be allowed, really. Two days later, she tests positive for Covid-19. She has no particular symptoms, but she must stay in hospital. The day after that, my dad tests positive, too. Most probably he picked it up on the second visit to hospital with my brother. Covid is why he can’t taste anything, can scarcely speak or move, and it turns out I have been strong enough to nurse him after all. I follow all the instructions to quarantine, send away my children and all the help. My father and I sit and look at the wall, alone.</p><p> 但当她当然不允许，真的。两天后，她测试了Covid-19的肯定。她没有特别的症状，但她必须留在医院。之后的第二天，我的父亲也测试了积极的。大多数人可能会在与兄弟的第二次访问第二次访问。 Covid是为什么他不能品尝任何东西，都不能说话或搬家，事实证明我已经足够强大，以便毕竟护理他。我遵循所有指示来隔离，送走我的孩子和所有的帮助。我父亲和我坐着看墙壁。</p><p> I can’t bring myself to tell my mother the nursing home plan has collapsed. In the one further phone call I have with her I say she is getting out, and she says I am a great woman, a champion. I say soon she will be back in her big chair in the front room and we will be making marmalade, it is the season, and she says that is just what she wants. Then she says good night. I’m not very surprised when the doctor phones early the next day to tell me she has died.</p><p> 我不能让自己告诉我的母亲护理家庭计划已经崩溃了。在我和她一起的另一个电话里，我说她已经出去了，她说我是一个伟大的女人，冠军。我很快就说她会回到前室里的大椅子上，我们将成为橘子酱，是季节，她说这就是她想要的。然后她说晚安。当医生手机在第二天告诉我她已经死亡时，我并不令人惊讶。</p><p>  A t first my father does not take it in. For three days, he is mostly asleep, and when he is awake, entirely preoccupied with fears about his body: whether he needs the loo, whether he will fall on the step, if he is too cold or too hot. Then his grandchildren come round and stand outside the window, and he is suddenly filled with joy. “I thought I was dead,” he says, just as my mother did. “I never thought such a day would come.”</p><p>  首先，我的父亲不接受它。三天，他大多睡着了，当他醒来时，完全全神贯注于对他的身体担心：如果他需要厕所，如果他都会陷入困境太冷或太热了。然后他的孙子们来绕着窗外站在窗外，他突然充满了喜悦。 “我以为我已经死了，”他说，就像母亲所做的那样。 “我从未想过这么一天会来。” </p><p> But with this awakening comes the realisation that my mother is really dead and he has to live without her. He cannot think of a good plan for this at all: the extent to which they had been living for each other is fully exposed. He explains something I had already noticed: that his Parkinson’s means he can’t type any more, and is getting in the way of his reading. There won’t be any more scholarly articles, any more helping young people with their PhDs. His books are all written now.</p><p>但是，通过这种觉醒来实现我的母亲真的死了，他必须没有她。他无法想到一个良好的计划：他们彼此生活的程度完全暴露。他解释了我已经注意到的东西：他的帕金森的意思是他不能再键入，并正在妨碍他的阅读方式。没有更多的学术文章，任何帮助年轻人都有他们的博士。他的书现在都写得。</p><p> “Well,” I say, “they’re good books.” When he lies down to sleep he says: “I think about dying, you know, every night. I do want it.”</p><p> “好吧，”我说，“他们是好书。”当他躺下睡觉时，他说：“我想到了，你知道，每晚都知道。我要这样做。“</p><p> In the night, his boat is called in. In the morning, I find him collapsed in bed, breathing hoarsely, mostly unconscious. I get out the advance decisions, his and my mother’s, and read them all through. I phone up the doctors and say my father has had a stroke or heart attack and please may I speak to someone.</p><p> 在夜晚，他的船被召唤。在早上，我发现他瘫倒在床上，呼吸嘶哑，大多是无意识的。我拿出了提前决定，他和我的母亲，并通过了全部阅读。我打电话给医生，说我的父亲有一个中风或心脏病发作，请问我可以和某人说话。</p><p>  “I’m not going to do that,” I say. “He made an advance decision on that, and it is very clear.”</p><p>  “我不会那样做，”我说。 “他对此做出了预先做出决定，很明显。”</p><p> “You have to call 999 with a stroke,” says the receptionist. “My husband had a stroke last year and that’s what I had to do, call 999. You can’t have any help if you don’t call 999.”</p><p> “你必须拨打999冲程，”接待员说。 “去年我的丈夫有一个中风，这就是我要做的，如果你不叫999，你就不能有任何帮助。”</p><p> “OK,” I say, “we won’t have any help. Please will you inform the doctors?”</p><p> “好的，”我说，“我们不会有任何帮助。请你通知医生？“</p><p> And that turned out to be the right thing to say. With that last, desperate, refusal, my father and I pass through the looking-glass into the world of those dying at home. We are amazed and grateful to find that even in January 2021 the GP will come to the house, district nurses will call twice a day and fit him with a driver for morphine and a fantastic new anti-anxiety drug, the first, perhaps, to touch his problem. “I am so impressed with this letting me die business,” he says to the nurse, in one of the last times he fully opened his eyes.</p><p> 这结果是正确的话。最后，绝望，拒绝，我的父亲和我通过看起来的玻璃，进入家里奄奄一息的世界。我们很惊讶地感谢，即使在2021年1月，GP也会来到房子，区护士每天都会致电两次，并用司机司机为吗啡和一个梦幻般的新抗焦虑药，第一个，也许是触摸他的问题。 “我这么印象深刻，让我生意，”他对护士说，在最后一次他完全睁开眼睛之一。 </p><p>  “Pace yourself,” all these visitors say to me, though it is not clear how I should do this. The council phones to tell me that I am entitled to carer support, but as there aren’t any carers, I won’t be getting any. But when it all gets too gruelling, my brother appears, my cousin, my niece and nephew, my children, and we manage. My father rallies to listen to messages and say goodbye to us, then struggles, then sleeps, then, after 10 days, dies. The primary cause of death is certified as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or a broken heart. Covid-19, as it is for my mother, is listed as a secondary cause.</p><p>“自己，”所有这些游客对我说，虽然不清楚我应该如何做到这一点。理事会告诉我，我有权获得护理人员，但由于没有任何照顾者，我不会得到任何。但是，当它得到太艰苦时，我的兄弟出现，我的堂兄，我的侄女和侄子，我的孩子，我们管理。我的父亲会听取消息并向我们说再见，然后挣扎，然后睡觉，然后，10天后，死亡。死亡的主要原因是Takotsubo心肌病或伤心的认证。 Covid-19，因为它是我母亲，被列为次要原因。</p><p> And thus both my parents become statistics on the news. They are in so many ways typical Covid victims – exactly the median age with a number of co-morbidities – that I feel I should be able to find them in those numbers, mourn them when the nation stands in silence and puts out flags for the fallen. It’s hard, though. My parents weren’t fighting that war. If Covid shortened their lives, it was not by much: the loneliness of lockdown hit them harder. They did not want to combat death: they were trying to let it in, to find a human way to go. It was extraordinary and revealing of the values of the NHS that in the middle of a pandemic, their hospital did not hesitate to give a hi-tech emergency operation and three days on a ventilator to someone as frail as my mother, but also indicative of our norms around death that no one stopped to ask if she had an advance decision in place.</p><p> 因此，我的父母都成为关于这个消息的统计数据。他们是如此多的方式典型的covid受害者 - 究竟是一个与许多共同的中位年龄 - 我觉得我应该能够在这些数字中找到它们，当国家默默地沉默并为此造出旗帜而哀悼他们堕落。但是很难。我的父母没有争夺那场战争。如果Covid缩短了自己的生活，那就不是很多：锁定的孤独袭击了他们更加困难。他们不想打击死亡：他们试图让它进去，找到一种人的方式。这是一个非凡的，揭示了在大流行中间的NHS的价值观，他们的医院毫不犹豫地给予高科技应急操作，并在呼吸机上给某人带到我母亲的人身上，但也表明了我们在死亡周围的规范，没有人停止询问她是否有提前决定。</p><p> But our family isn’t “ripped apart” by their deaths, as the current narrative would have it either – certainly not as i</p><p> 但是我们的家人并不是他们的死亡“撕裂”，因为目前的叙述要么是它 - 肯定不是我</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/06/letting-go-my-battle-to-help-my-parents-die-a-good-death">https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/06/letting-go-my-battle-to-help-my-parents-die-a-good-death</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/战斗/">#战斗</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/battle/">#battle</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/母亲/">#母亲</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
