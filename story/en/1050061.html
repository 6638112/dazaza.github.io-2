I&#39;m trying to remember how it was thatI ended up being a Lisp hacker when I started out disliking thelanguage and somewhat uninterested in computers. I&#39;m also trying tounderstand why many, if not most of my classmates found &#39;001difficult, and Lisp to be confusing, annoying, and exasperating. AndI&#39;m trying to spin this into a somewhat coherent story.  I think I&#39;m going to relax the coherence, though. I&#39;m ending up witha pile of blog fragments that I can&#39;t seem to organize, but I don&#39;twant to lose them, either. Fortunately, this is a blog and no one expectsparticularly high editorial standards, so I&#39;ll just post some ofthese.   There were several great lectures in 6.001, but that first one wasthe most memorable because it showed me that  real computer hackersweren&#39;t writing accounts receivable and inventory reporting programsbut were having an awful lot of fun making machines do amazingthings. I figured out that the more I learned, the more fun it wouldbe. Each lecture re-confirmed that. I was hooked. I couldn&#39;t waitfor the homework assignments because then I could get the computer todo amazing things, too. This had the added benefit that the lab wasgenerally empty so there would be no wait for machines and I couldspend extra time experimenting after finishing the problem sets.  (The recitations and tutorials, however, were a different story.Recitations were smaller classes of about 30 or so people where agraduate student would go over the material covered in the lecturesand in the homework in much more detail. The tutorials were smallsessions where a graduate student would give 4 or 5 students verydetailed instruction and help on homework. The recitations wereuninteresting, but it gave me a chance to make sure I understood thelectures and didn&#39;t miss any important points. The tutorials weredeathly dull and I stopped going to those.)  One thing I enjoyed about the lectures was that I&#39;d often find myselfreconsidering math and physics from a very different viewpoint. Thelectures and the text would frequently start with a very naive andunsophisticated model of a problem and then spend time refining it.On more than one occasion I&#39;d get new insights into things I thought Ialready knew.  A couple of examples come from the second lecture. We were going toteach the computer how to take square roots. I had learned two waysto (manually) take square roots in high school. The first was ahorribly complex process that was somewhat like long division, but wasquite a bit harder. The second was to use a table of square roots andinterpolate. I assumed that the table was laboriously generated thelong way and that we were going to implement the long way on thecomputer. Instead we used Newton&#39;s method.  I remembered Newton&#39;s method from calculus, but it didn&#39;t occur to methat it would be a practical technique. Part of it was that Newton&#39;smethod didn&#39;t give you the answer to the problem, but rather anapproximation to the answer. I didn&#39;t think approximations would beacceptable. But the main point wasn&#39;t that we were using a particularmethod to solve a particular problem, but that we if we didn&#39;t know agood way to get the answer to a problem, we could try taking a randomguess at an answer and get the computer to keep refining thisapproximation until we got an answer that was good enough.  The second example came from a demonstration of proceduralabstraction. The lecturer (it was Hal or Bill Siebert, I can&#39;tremember) pointed out that many of the programs we had written hadsimilar structure. I was expecting to be told about the ‘SymmetryPrinciple: Programs should be symmetric and uniform when performingsimilar functions, unless there is good reason to the contrary.’Instead, the lecturer wrote an abstract version of the program wherethe varying parts were replaced by names. Then the several programsfrom before were easily changed into simple calls to the abstractversion. The ‘symmetry principle’, which was so important to theprevious computer course, was suddenly irrelevant. You&#39;d never haveprograms performing similar functions if you simply abstracted out thesimilarity.  The lecturer went on to show how the Sigma notation from mathematicswas just a way to abstract out repeated addition (no greatrevelation there, but a nice concise explanation). He then went on toshow that once you had an abstraction like this, you could use it as abuilding block for other abstractions. He wrote an approximation ofthe definite integral using the summation procedure he just defined.I was impressed. I wasn&#39;t as blown away as I was on that first day,but still, in two days we covered the main points of an entiresemester of calculus.  But it also helped me understand something that I didn&#39;t understandwhen I took calculus. My calculus teacher made a point of alwaysconstructing a Riemann sum before writing the integral equation. Ididn&#39;t understand the point of this extra step because you aren&#39;tdoing anything much more than just replacing the sigma with the bigcurly S --- what&#39;s the difference? In the code example, however, itwas clear that we were computing a sum and the value of the sumdepended upon how finely we divided up the elements. The more pieces,the smaller each piece, the more accurate the answer, and the longerit took to get the answer. Going from a Riemann sum to a definiteintegral involved taking the limit as dx goes to zero. This is anabstract process in mathematics, but a concrete one given our computerprogram. It was hard to see what could go wrong when replacing theletter sigma with the big curly S, but it is pretty easy to see thatthe program might not converge if the function being integrated issuitably perverse. What seemed like a pointless rewrite in thecalculus course became a condition that had to be satisfied in orderto run the program.</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/03/writing-blog-entries-is-hard.html">https://funcall.blogspot.com/2009/03/writing-blog-entries-is-hard.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/继续/">#继续</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
