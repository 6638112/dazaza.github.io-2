"note_en": "The Ladies of iFixit have earned 1 million in  reputation! This collective milestone is thanks to a wonderful group of women fixers, each of whom contribute to iFixit\u2019s community by finding solutions to repair-related problems.\n So who are the Ladies of iFixit? We are comprised of  51 members, who together and over a significant period of time have authored or contributed to 3,000  repair guides and provided 486 solutions to the repair community. Our ladies are from different departments (and countries), but we are not pigeonholed by our positions or titles\u2014all of us can fix.\n We share whatever knowledge we have, be it by answering questions on our  Answers Forum, creating a guide, or improving the knowledge base by editing existing guides and tackling unanswered questions.\n  Our resident guidekeeper and orphan slayer (trust us, it\u2019s nicer than it sounds),  Sam Goldheart makes up the bulk of our 1 million achievement, with 443K in reputation, 108 solutions, and 2,287 guides authored or edited. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I made one [guide], but I love that they\u2019re still helping people out every day,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGetting comments on those guides always makes my day.\u201d These days, she considers herself a \u201clead-tech-writer-turned-blog-writer,\u201d who does a little bit of everything around the iFixit office. And while she isn\u2019t exclusively writing guides anymore, the Internet still reaps the benefits of her meticulous instructions.\n One fixer  saved over $400 thanks to a Goldheart guide. Another praised her  attention to detail in providing accurate screw sizes and emphasizing necessary precautions to avoid accidents. \u201cIt was hard work to make those guides, but the investment super paid-off,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAs an Easter egg, readers can look up my very first guide, one I made before I was hired. It\u2019s pretty bad!\u201d\n  Sam\u2019s candor speaks to the core of the iFixit philosophy. Even if you write a \u201cpretty bad guide\u201d when you\u2019re starting out, at least you\u2019re sharing what you know. With enough patience and curiosity, you can hone your skills, grow your confidence, and fix more things. And that\u2019s what we are all about here!\n Our Japanese Localization Lead,  Midori Doi started working at iFixit just before the iFixit Japanese website launched. At the time, iFixit was known in Japan more for our iPhone teardowns than for our repair guides. And while thousands of English language repair guides were available on the iFixit website, none were available in Japanese.\n  \u201cWhen I started the translation work I felt as though I was walking through a vast desert all alone. However, over the past six years, thanks to the massive help of so many volunteers and repair lovers from around the world, the translation work has advanced tremendously and the Japanese pages have been greatly enriched,\u201d Midori said.\n Her passion for repair has its roots in the popular Japanese expression, \u201c mottainai!\u201d which means, \u201cwhat a waste!\u201d Midori says this expression is passed on from generation to generation to remind us about the importance of minimizing waste. \u201cWe have been using an old washing machine for more than 10 years\u2026we have done a few simple repairs along the way to keep it working\u2026I think about the money we have saved by repairing our machine with parts that cost a total of $50,\u201d Midori said.\n  Midori once demonstrated how anyone can do repairs on the spot, next to  CEO Kyle Wiens. Just before a talk about iFixit product design and e-waste at a Super Science High School in Tokyo, her MacBook Pro\u2019s hard drive cable stopped working. Wiens suggested they repair the laptop during the presentation. \u201cMy hands got sweaty, as I had never done a computer repair,\u201d Midori said. \u201cFollowing the instructions from the iFixit repair guide, and with Kyle\u2019s guidance, I was able to successfully replace the part\u2014and it took only 15 minutes!\u201d\n That unplanned, live demonstration showed students that anyone can do repairs. Midori\u2019s commitment to growing the Japanese repair community, and shifting the collective mindset from replace to repair, has garnered her 202K in reputation. \u201cTake it from this repair amateur, you do NOT need to be a technological whiz/professional in order to do repairs. And the more you do repair, the better you will get at it,\u201d Midori said.\n Many Ladies of iFixit have been repairing things for a long time, before fully realizing its environmental and intellectual benefits. iFixit\u2019s Community Manager,  Amber Taus, has always been interested in how things work.\n  \u201cWhen I was 4, I took the case off our VCR, and I would sit and watch the tapes play while everyone else watched the movie,\u201d said Taus. The majority of her reputation is actually on our  Meta site, rather than on the  Answers Forum or through  guide making. Meta is a dedicated space for fixers to talk about iFixit. There, Taus has fostered an open environment, where she connects with our volunteer moderators and community members who are seeking answers related to iFixit itself.\n Amber\u2019s unique position in managing both communities has earned her significant reputation since starting at iFixit earlier this year. On Meta she\u2019s earned 3,177 in reputation and provided 164 solutions; on iFixit, she\u2019s earned 2,864 in reputation and provided 35 solutions. Taus takes time out of her day to look around the site and enjoy content that predated her arrival.\n  \u201cMy favorite guide is a  teardown of an orange. It\u2019s so funny and there was so much attention to detail,\u201d Amber said. \u201cThe  final step with the components of the orange laid out is just so  beautiful.\u201d Humor aside, Amber insists that the best guides are the ones that are easy to follow and that make a repairer feel comfortable, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t normal for people to take care of their own stuff until I had to teach my sister-in-law how to change a tire on her car.\u201d\n No matter the reputation count, each one of us is pushing the needle forward for repair, and doing what we can to reduce (and one day eliminate) the harsh effects that poor design and e-waste have on the planet.\n So keep up the good work ladies! There is still plenty of fixing to do!", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:09:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5973\u58eb\u4eec,ifixit", "title":

"note_en": "Mozilla is one of the Open Source greatest champions of all time. It played a unique role throughout history in the promotion of Free Software and greatly contributed to the success of Linux.\n In the 90\u2019s Netscape Navigator was the most popular Web browser but it quickly lost its lead to Internet Explorer which came bundled with Microsoft Windows. The Web was changing rapidly, Explorer was dominant (it reached 95% user share in 2003) to the point where most websites no longer cared about compatibility with other browsers or operating systems and we got in a situation where Microsoft de-facto dictated Web standards.\n Netscape did something formidable at the time. It released its source code to the World. Mozilla was formed to use that code and coordinate the development of a new Open Source browser, which eventually became Firefox. A few years later the Web was no longer dominated by a single browser. In 2010 Firefox represented 30% of the user share and Internet Explorer had gone down to 50%.\n Firefox didn\u2019t just save the Web, it promoted the idea of Free Software to millions of people who were using Windows, Mac or other proprietary operating systems. In the 2000\u2019s, distribution shipped with Firefox, which many Windows users already knew and loved. This made it easier for people to migrate to Linux and distributions became more mainstream.\n We have our champions. Pioneers and early adopters remember the importance of key projects and key personalities in the history of Linux and of Free Software. I remember using Netscape on Unix terminals at the university, even before we had Linux at home. I remember having the best browser available at a time when even getting a sound card to work in our favorite operating system was a challenge and very few software applications were available.\n Nowadays this is still true. Firefox is still a champion of Open Source, it still proudly promotes Free Software outside of our community and it still produces one of the best and the most open browsers available not only to us but to millions of people who enjoy it on proprietary operating systems before migrating to Linux.\n It\u2019s a real pleasure for us to join forces with Mozilla and to start this partnership.\n  Firefox will continue to be distributed as .deb packages through the official Linux Mint repositories. Its configuration and the way it is built is changing to make the Linux Mint version of Firefox much more similar (almost identical in fact) to the version which is distributed by Mozilla.\n In the past Linux Mint used its own default settings and configured Firefox in a specific way. Most of this configuration is abandoned to go back to Mozilla defaults.\n The default search engines no longer include Linux Mint search partners (Yahoo, DuckDuckGo\u2026) but Mozilla search partners (Google, Amazon, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Ebay\u2026)\n For Mozilla, the goal is to make Firefox work the same way across all platforms to ease maintenance and simplify development and bug fixing. With these changes Firefox will give the same experience in Linux Mint as it does in other operating systems.\n For us, this change means a tremendous simplification in terms of maintenance and development. We used to build Firefox ourselves using Ubuntu\u2019s packaging (which is set to be discontinued as Ubuntu is moving towards snap). We now package the Mozilla version of Firefox instead.\n With this partnership we also satisfy Mozilla\u2019s requests when it comes to using their intellectual property (their name, brands and identity). For example, the Firefox icon is changing to follow Mozilla\u2019s usage guidelines.\n   It\u2019s both. Thanks to this partnership it\u2019s also much easier for us to communicate with Mozilla and to work with them on improving Firefox in Linux Mint.\n In the past we added support for XApp window progress, which is the the ability to show progress in the Cinnamon panel window list when you download something with Firefox.\n Better support for rounded corner in Firefox\u2019s own window decorations is coming in Firefox 96.\n We\u2019re hoping to work with Mozilla on software updates in 2022, to make it easier for Firefox and the Update Manager to work together and for users to be able to see and apply browser updates straight from the browser itself.\n  In Linux Mint 19.x, 20.x and LMDE the transition is taking place with Firefox version 96, and it is planned for January 11th \u2013 January 12th.\n In Linux Mint 20.3 the transition took place during the BETA with Firefox version 95.\n  Technically and ideally, no. Preserving user settings is key. It\u2019s a very important notion in software development and it\u2019s taken very seriously both by Linux Mint and by Mozilla.\n Changes to the default settings can however have an impact on your experience, since your settings are basically a layer of changes (overwrites) on top of the default values. As the default values change, any setting which isn\u2019t overridden by a user value can indeed trigger a behavior change.\n  Yes, your default engine will continue to be Google. The only change is that it no longer will be a user added engine, it will be considered (and replaced by Firefox) as a system core engine.\n I used Yahoo/DuckDuckGo/StartPage as my default search engine, will it continue to be my default?\n No, these were core engines in the Linux Mint configuration. They no longer are present in the Mozilla version of Firefox. The default engine will switch to Google. DuckDuckGo will remain available but with a different URL (it\u2019s a Mint search partner in the Mint configuration, but only a Mozilla partner in the Mozilla configuration).\n   In other browsers the only engines which generate an income for Linux Mint are Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and Startpage.\n      Note that \u201cmint-001\u201d and \u201c1.0\u201d are not the version of Firefox. They don\u2019t relate to the packaging version either. They just represent identifiers of Linux Mint within Firefox.\n    In Linux Mint the Update Manager is responsible for all software updates, and applying updates requires root privileges.\n \u201c Your browser is being managed by your organization\u201d might look a bit scary but all it means is that Firefox was told to not worry about updating itself.\n In the About dialog, \u201c Updates disabled by your system administrator\u201d has the same meaning.\n We\u2019ll work with Mozilla on this, first to rephrase this, and hopefully later this year to be able to handle Firefox updates from within Firefox.\n      This helps us understand what language you\u2019re using, and to see what relevant packages and versions are installed so we can reproduce issues and troubleshoot them.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:06:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,mint", "title": "Linux Mint\u4e0eMozilla\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "Linux Mint signs a partnership with Mozilla", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4244", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "mint"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072653, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "C ++\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u662fC ++\u6807\u51c6\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6b63\u5728\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03\u6211\u7684\uff09\uff1aSTD :: REGEX\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4Python\u548cPHP\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u7528\u9014\u6162\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u7ea610-100\u500d\u6162\u73b0\u4ee3\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7b49\u540c\u7269\uff0c\u5982Rust\u6216Go\u3002 C ++\u4ee5\u7ee9\u6548\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u800cC ++\u9677\u5165\u4e86\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\u5c06\u6253\u7834ABI\u3002 RUDES ......", "note_en": "C++ is a bad example here.

By joining  Mozilla and The Markup\u2019s \u201cFacebook Pixel Hunt\u201d in Firefox, people can help  Rally and The Markup unravel how Facebook\u2019s tracking infrastructure massively collects data about people online \u2013 data that is used to target ads, tailor content recommendations and spread misinformation \u2013 all by simply browsing the web.\n The Markup is the newest partner for  Rally, the privacy-first data-sharing platform  that was  created by Mozilla in 2021 to take back control from platforms that are not transparent about how they use people\u2019s data and make it very difficult for independent outside research to take place. Rally is a novel way for people to help answer systemic questions by contributing their own browsing behavior data, putting it to work as part of a collective effort to solve societal problems that start online and that we have not been able to investigate this way before.\n Using tools provided by Rally, the two organizations will research how Facebook tracks people across the web through its Facebook pixel-powered ad network and shine a light on what Facebook knows about their online life. By opting into  \u201cThe Facebook Pixel Hunt\u201d study, Rally gives Firefox users the power to help answer questions like: What kind of data does the Facebook pixel collect? Which sites share this data? What can this data reveal about people? What other ways does Facebook track people? How widespread is Facebook\u2019s tracking network?\n Mozilla is excited to partner with The Markup. Cited by legislators to combat  discriminatory tenant screening and mortgage lending, The Markup\u2019s journalism has distinguished itself with its direct impact on people\u2019s lives. The partnership of the two organizations brings together Rally\u2019s technical skill and The Markup\u2019s data-driven investigative journalism, exposing the problems of informational asymmetry on the internet and shedding light on systems of online surveillance used by companies like Facebook.\n \u201cA tool like Rally can bring the full force of communities of people joining together to provide insights into one of the most opaque parts of the internet that have such a dramatic impact on our individual lives and on society. This is a rare opportunity to lift the veil over Facebook\u2019s tracking and data collection practices outside of the Facebook platforms.\u201d\n Ted Han, Rally Product Lead at Mozilla\n Facebook has repeatedly slowed down efforts to bring transparency and to help independent third parties research and understand the mechanisms at play on its platforms: it  shut down CrowdTangle,  blocked ProPublica\u2019s Ad Transparency tools,  modified code to prevent The Markup\u2019s Citizen Browser from collecting user-volunteered data and canceled  NYU\u2019s AdObserver researchers\u2019 accounts.\n \u201cThe Internet and the world cannot wait on platforms to do the right thing, especially when so much depends on it. This partnership seeks to lead the way in providing new and critical ways of illuminating the reality of the internet, led by the people who make it. This partnership comes at a time when the consequences of fragmented awareness have never been more stark.\u201d\n  Ted Han, Rally Product Lead at Mozilla\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with Mozilla, which shares our commitment to a more transparent and trusted internet. Rally is an open invitation for the public to contribute to important research into some of today\u2019s most pressing issues, and we\u2019re excited to investigate wherever it leads.\u201d\n Julia Angwin, editor-in-chief and founder of The Markup\n The Markup will be Rally\u2019s first non-academic partner. Rally launched as a Firefox extension in 2021. It has supported a study in collaboration with  Princeton University\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy about news and misinformation about politics and COVID-19 across online services, and another ongoing study with  the Stanford University Graduate School of Business on news consumption and the impact of ads.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 02:54:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "facebook,\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34,partners", "title": "Mozilla\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60Facebook\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6", "title_en": "Mozilla partners with The Markup to study Facebook tracking and data collection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/mozilla-themarkup-partner-rally-facebook-tracking-data-collection/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34", "partners"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cec382bb5ab0479563eee67628857dec.jpg", "infoid": 1072650, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u5979\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u6210\u4e86\u623f\u4e3b\u65f6\uff0c\u8389\u65af\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u8bb0\u5f97\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u516d\u5c81\uff0c\u5979\u4e5f\u660e\u767d\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u4e8b\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u4e0e\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u548c\u623f\u5c4b\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u8ff7\u604b\u3002\u5728\u5728\u5f6d\u535a\u793e\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5979\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u623f\u5c4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5979\u60f3\u628a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u8d4b\u4e88\u5e73\u5747\u623f\u4e3b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5979\u521b\u7acb\u4e86\u5883\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u623f\u4e3b\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6539\u9020\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u660e\u667a\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u3002 Darrell\uff0cJordan\u548cLiz\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u6570\u636e\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u623f\u4e3b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4ee5\u53caDarrell\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4ed6\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u5ba4Dungeon\u5065\u8eab\u623f\u7528\u4e8e\u8fce\u63a5ROI\u3002", "note_en": "Liz Young remembers when her family became homeowners, even at six years old she understood it was a big deal.

Last night, the HFPA\u2019s Golden Globes Twitter account regularly  forgot to note which TV or movie projects Globe recipients were winning for \u2014 like how  Andrew Garfield\u2019s win was for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d, for example \u2014 when it was announcing the night\u2019s winners on social media. The organization also oddly referred to \u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d laughter (?) as being \u201cthe best medicine,\u201d in a tweet it later deleted, only to be posted again to say that  music was the best medicine \u2014 which is not how that saying goes.\n  Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for  pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE\n  In addition to being an overall quieter year as the HFPA tries to reform its organization following the controversies, the winning networks also aren\u2019t touting their victories as they would normally, despite some seeing some notable firsts and upsets.\n  In prior years, HBO would be happily promoting its sweep over rivals. The network led the night with six wins, including four for HBO and two for HBO Max. Several of these were for its TV series \u201cSuccession,\u201d which won for best TV drama, TV drama actor (Jeremy Strong), and supporting actress (Sarah Snook.) HBO Max\u2019s comedy \u201cHacks\u201d also notably beat out Emmy winner \u201cTed Lasso\u201d (Apple TV+) as best comedy, and saw its lead, Jean Smart, win for best actress in a comedy. And Kate Winslet won best TV actress in a limited series for HBO\u2019s \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d.\n Meanwhile, though Netflix  led the year by nominations \u2014 including for best dramatic film \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and drama series \u201cSquid Game\u201d \u2014 it had said it wouldn\u2019t participate in the event until the HFPA institutes changes. That decision means it\u2019s also now not bragging about a couple of notable firsts that resulted from last night\u2019s awards.\n Netflix\u2019s big win of the night was for its original film, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d which became the streamer\u2019s first-ever movie to take home a Golden Globe for best motion picture (drama). The movie also won for best director (Jane Campion) and best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\n In addition, Netflix\u2019s runaway hit TV series \u201cSquid Game\u201d received three nominations this year, leading to  the first-ever win for South Korea, as South Korean actor O Yeong-su won for his role in the series, beating out \u201cSuccession\u2019s\u201d Kieran Culkin (HBO) and \u201cThe Morning Show\u2019s\u201d Billy Crudup (Apple TV+).\n Netflix also won for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d when Andrew Garfield took the trophy for best actor in a motion picture (musical or comedy), though the tweet had forgotten to credit the project by name.\n Apple TV+ took home one win last night as \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Jason Sudeikis won best actor in a TV series (comedy). Hulu also got one Globe, as \u201cDopesick\u2019s\u201d Michael Keaton won best actor in a TV limited series or motion picture made for television, while Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d won the category. Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d was highlighted with Nicole Kidman\u2019s win as best actress in a motion picture.\n In another milestone, the first trans actress to win a Golden Globe, FX\u2019s \u201cPose\u201d star Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, took home the trophy for best actress in a drama.\n 20th Century Studio/Disney\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story\u201d won best picture (musical or comedy) and its stars, Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose won best actress and supporting actress, respectively. Disney\u2019s \u201cEncanto,\u201d which streamed on Disney+ just a month after hitting theaters, won best animated picture.\n Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cDune\u201d got the trophy for best score (Hans Zimmer), and Will Smith was named best actor in a motion picture (drama) for \u201cKing Richard.\u201d\u00a0The best non-English language picture award went to the Japanese film \u201cDrive My

"note_en": "Across cultures and geographies, animals have been such a vital part of the food chain that it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where animals are not put to the knife to produce protein.\n There\u2019s no stopping innovation, however, and alternative sources of protein are increasingly becoming a choice people would rather make.\n Cell-cultured meat is one such source. Also known as cultivated or lab-grown meat, this process uses cells from animals to make meat without slaughter. While the nascent sector is a hot topic for the benefits it promises, the process remains slow and costly.\n Investments in this sector are heating up, though. If 2021 was anything to go by, there is an abundance of both companies and investors hungry for ways to scale and speed up the process \u2014 and do it profitably.\n However, it\u2019s not yet clear when meat grown in labs will reach the kind of scale required to see it at your local grocery store.\n   Cell-cultured meat owes its growing popularity, at least in part, to some of the macro challenges the world faces with food production. Overcultivation, human-made climate change and diminishing sources of water are all contributing to a future where food insecurity will be a gigantic problem.\n The outlook is bleak: The United Nations estimates  food production will need to double to feed the  nearly 10 billion people expected to populate the planet by 2050. As for protein, people around the world  consumed about 324 million metric tons of meat in 2020, and that number is set to  rise even further.\n Changing how we cultivate and produce food is key to solving this problem, and we already have  systems like vertical farming to address the problem of overcultivation, as well as protein sources other than meat. Currently, alternative protein  makes up just about 2% of the animal protein market, but it is expected to increase more than 7x by 2025.\n \u201cWe are trying to meet the  Paris Agreement, but we can\u2019t meet that without addressing the food system and the way we produce meat, eggs and dairy,\u201d said Sharyn Murray, senior investor engagement specialist at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit advocating for reimagined meat production. \u201cThe conversion ratio for calories in versus calories out is seven to eight calories for a chicken for one calorie out, while plant-based is one calorie in and one out.\u201d\n Cultivated meat is just one of the approaches to meeting future demand for protein alongside plant-based and fermentation techniques. Murray and others I spoke to referred to the movement as \u201ca massive transformation of the food system that will take time.\u201d Meaning the shift will not happen overnight, Murray said.\n There is also only one company with cell-cultured meat products available in the market currently: Eat Just, whose subsidiary GOOD Meat has received regulatory approval to produce and sell its cell-cultured meat in Singapore. Eat Just also recently received approval to sell chicken breasts made with cell cultures.\n  Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said the movement is here even if people are not buying a lot of lab-grown meat yet.\n \u201cIt is still small-scale, and the most important thing we are doing that other companies should do is focus on the design, engineering and full-scale installations of vessels and the supporting systems to make a lot of it.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:56:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u51c6\u5907,cultured,\u8089\u7c7b", "title": "\u7ec6\u80de\u57f9\u517b\u7684\u8089\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u5417\uff1f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIs cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/is-cell-cultured-meat-ready-for-prime-time/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51c6\u5907", "cultured", "\u8089\u7c7b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "01bfee01639abb80ed1d27623c21a6b5.jpg", "infoid": 1072647, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e11\u670826\u65e5\u9996\u6b21\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bf4\u9ed1\u5ba2\u662f\u5426\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u4efb\u4f55\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u57281\u67087\u65e5\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0cPanasonic\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e86\u4e0e\u7533\u8bf7\u5c31\u4e1a\u6216\u53c2\u52a0\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u67d0\u4e9b\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5b9e\u4e60\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u6709\u5173\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u677e\u4e0b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u901a\u77e5\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4eba\u3002\nPanasonic\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd8\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u572811\u670811\u65e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u572811\u67083\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u5e76\u4e8e11\u67083\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732 - \u5c1a\u672a\u547d\u540d\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u83b7\u53d6\u542b\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u4f19\u4f34\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u672a\u6307\u660e\u7684\u201c\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u5173\u5546\u4e1a\u4f19\u4f34\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u4e0b\u8dcc\u7684\u88c1\u5458\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c11\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u51fb\u4e2dPanasonic\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u9ed1\u5ba2\u6cc4\u9732\u4e864\u5343\u5146\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d22\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u3002", "note_en": "At the time of the data breach,  which the company first confirmed on November 26, the company was unable to say whether hackers had accessed any sensitive information.

"note_en": "Anyone running modern production systems knows about testing followed by  gradual or staged rollouts, in which changes to a running system are deployed gradually over a long period of time, to reduce the possibility of accidentally taking down everything at once. For example, the last time I needed to make a change to Google\u2019s core DNS zone files, the change was tested against many many regression tests and then deployed to each of Google\u2019s four name servers, one at a time, over a period of 24 hours. Regression testing checks that the change does not appear to affect answers it shouldn\u2019t have, and then the gradual rollout gives plenty of time for both automated systems and reliability engineers to notice unexpected problems and stop the rollout. NPM\u2019s design choice is the exact opposite. The latest version of colors was promoted to use in all its dependents before any of them had a chance to test it and without any kind of gradual rollout.Users can disable this behavior today, by pinning the exact versions of all their dependencies. For example here is  the fix to aws-cdk. That\u2019s not a good answer, but at least it\u2019s possible. The right path forward for NPM and package managers like it is to stop preferring the latest possible version of all dependencies when installing a new package. Instead, they should prefer to use the dependency versions that the package was actually tested with, or versions as close as possible to those. I call that a   high-fidelity build. In contrast, the people who installed aws-cdk and other packages over the weekend got low-fidelity builds: NPM inserted a new version of colors that the developers of these other packages had never tested against. Users got to test that brand new configuration themselves over the weekend, and the test failed. High-fidelity builds solve both the testing problem and the gradual rollout problem. A new version of colors wouldn\u2019t get picked up by an aws-cdk install until the aws-cdk authors had gotten a chance to test it and push a new version configuration in a new version of aws-cdk. At that point, all new aws-cdk installs would get the new colors, but all the other tools would still be unaffected, until they too tested and officially adopted the new version of colors. There are many ways to produce high-fidelity builds. In Go, a package declares the minimum required version of each dependency, and that\u2019s what the build uses, unless some other constraint in the same build graph requests a newer one. And then, it only uses that specific newer one, not the one that just appeared over the weekend and is entirely untested by anyone. For more about this approach, see \u201c The Principles of Versioning in Go.\u201d Package managers don\u2019t have to adopt Go\u2019s approach exactly. It would be enough, for example, to record the versions that the aws-cdk developers used for their testing and then reuse those versions during the install. In fact, NPM can already record those versions, in a lock file. But  npm install of a new package does not use the information in that package\u2019s lock file to decide the versions of dependencies: lock files are not transitive. NPM also has a new   npm shrinkwrap command, which appears to fix the problem for commands. Most of the authors of commands affected by the colors sabotage should be looking carefully at  npm shrinkwrap today. Kudos to NPM for providing a tool for package authors to protect themselves from this kind of problem. The next step, though, is for NPM to arrange for that kind of protection to happen by default. And then the same protection is needed when installing a new library package as a dependency, not just when installing a command. All this will require more work. Other package managers should take note too.

The   ATL2 was on final approach for the main runaway of the Lann-Bihou\u00e9 naval air base when a culprit started lasering the aircraft. The crew aborted the landing and regained altitude.\n  According to a French Navy statement, the crew then used the ATL2 sensors to \u201cvery accurately\u201d locate the origin of the laser. One of those sensors was likely the Wescam MX-20 EO/IR imaging system. It features an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) allowing for high target location accuracy and georeferencing (basically, the system provides accurate coordinates of the target it is pointing at).\n  As for the initial detection of the laser, it was probably done by the pilot and co-pilot with their \u201cmk1 eyeball\u201d (i.e their own eyes). Two sources with experience flying the ATL2 confirmed to  Naval News that there is no Missile Approach Warning (MAW) or Laser Warning systems onboard. (It is fitted with advanced electronic warfare systems but these are triggered by radar and communication frequencies, not laser). In this situation, the key for the crew is the coordination between the cockpit and the MX-20 operator in the back to \u201cfind and fix\u201d the target. But this is something ATL2 crews routinely train for. In war time scenarios, \u201ctrack and engage\u201d usually follows the \u201cfind and fix\u201d phase\u2026\n  As for the events on 4 January, the crew identified the culprit and recorded evidence of the offense with the sensor. While still in flight, the \u201csky sailors\u201d (as naval aircrews are called in the French Navy) transmitted these elements to the local police station, who quickly arrested the person and confiscated his equipment. Charges have been pressed and the investigation is ongoing.\n  Unfortunately, it is not the first time ATL2 crews are faced with the problem. Someone was   sentenced to six months in jail for similar acts at the same naval air base in 2018. According to local newspaper  Ouest France, the commander of the Lann-Bihou\u00e9 naval air base of reported in 2014 that ten military aircraft had been targeted by a laser in just nine months.\n   Faced with the resurgence of this type of events against the aircraft of the French Navy stationed on the air bases of Lanv\u00e9oc, Lann Bihou\u00e9 and Landivisiau, the maritime district commander recalls that the trade and possession of lasers are strictly regulated. Thus, owning or using a laser of a class higher than 2 can lead to a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment, with a fine of 7,500 euros. Beyond these criminal penalties, pointing a laser at an aircraft approaching a terrain risks causing serious and irremediable eye injuries to crew members. In the event of complete blindness of the pilots, the risk of an air accident is major.\n   ATL2  French Navy", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:18:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6d77\u519b,navy,\u6fc0\u5149", "title": "\u6cd5\u56fd\u6d77\u519bATL2 MPA\uff1a\u6709\u4eba\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u4e86\u9519\u4e86\u98de\u673a", "title_en": "French Navy ATL2 MPA: Someone Just Lasered The Wrong Aircraft", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/01/french-navy-atl2-mpa-someone-just-lasered-the-wrong-aircraft/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d77\u519b", "navy", "\u6fc0\u5149"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072643, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u591a\u6838OCAML\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "note_en": "Multicore OCaml integration.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:08:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "multicore,ocaml", "title": "Ocaml Multicore\u5408\u5e76\u4e0a\u6e38", "title_en": "OCaml Multicore merged upstream", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/001997e81342fd0d321fd877b73608150601e7d9", "via": "", "real_tags": ["multicore", "ocaml"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e5ad684eac6c5c5102d23318e1d71438.jpg", "infoid": 1072641, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53bb\u5e74\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684iCloud\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u4e3a\u6240\u6709iPhone Safari\u6d41\u91cf\u65e0\u7f1d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684VPN\u6837\u96a7\u9053\u3002\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u76ee\u524d\u4f5c\u4e3aIOS 15\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7248\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002Apple\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u94fe\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba - \u5305\u62ecApple  - \u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u662f\u8c01\u6216\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5c01\u4fe1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u524a\u51cf\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ece\u8bbf\u95ee\u201c\u91cd\u8981\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5728\u7834\u574f\u6b27\u6d32\u6570\u5b57\u4e3b\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u201c\u91cd\u5927\u540e\u679c\u201d\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u5b83\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u201c\u7ecf\u8425\u8005\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u201d\u3002\n\u9ed8\u8ba4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u7684iOS 15.2\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u4f46Apple\u5df2\u542f\u7528\u5b83\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u7528\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u7559\u4e0bBeta\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\n\u7535\u62a5\u8868\u793a\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e5f\u64ad\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9O2\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6295\u8bc9\u3002\n\u4f01\u4e1a\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528MDM\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7981\u7528\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u3002\n\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  - \u5728\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u7684\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u5730\u6253\u7834\u6709\u5173Apple\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u9875\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Twitter\uff0cFacebook\u548cLinkedIn\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce89to5Mac\u4ee5\u7559\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\uff1f\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u72ec\u5bb6\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0cHow-TOS\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684YouTube\u9891\u9053", "note_en": "One of the major new iCloud features announced last year was Private Relay, which seamlessly sets up an encrypted VPN-like tunnel for all iPhone Safari traffic. Private Relay is currently available as an opt-in beta in iOS 15. Apple says that this feature means that no one in the chain \u2014 including Apple \u2014 knows who you are or what website you are browsing to.\n It seems carriers in Europe don\u2019t like that idea too much.  Via The Telegraph, operators including Vodafone, Telefonica and T-Mobile signed an open letter voicing their opposition to the rollout of the feature. In fact, some carriers are already blocking support as shown in screenshots from readers below.\n  The letter said that Private Relay cuts off networks and servers from accessing \u201cvital network data and metadata\u201d and will have \u201csignificant consequences in terms of undermining European digital sovereignty\u201d. They say it will also impact \u201coperator\u2019s ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks\u201d.\n It\u2019s unclear why the companies are speaking out against Private Relay, when general VPN services have been widely available for years and do much of the same role. Perhaps it is the fact that Private Relay is so easily accessible that they expect a lot of people to use it; the feature is built into iOS 15 and available to any customer with a paid iCloud plan.\n As of the latest shipping release, iOS 15.2, Private Relay is off by default but Apple has signalled that it will be enabled as standard once Private Relay leaves beta testing phase.\n Cynically, Private Relay and other VPN services block the carriers ability to upsell internet features based on your phone plan, like compressing images or restricting HD video streaming to more expensive tiers.\n The Telegraph says mobile carriers in the UK have also aired concerns, including complaints to regulators from O2.\n Availability of Private Relay is already restricted by geography. In compliance with local laws, Apple has already announced that Private Relay will not be offered in China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.\n Enterprise-managed devices can also choose to disable Private Relay for their employees using MDM profiles.\n Some cellular data plans also appear to already be explicitly denying Private Relay functionality.

Flink ML is a library that provides APIs and infrastructure for buildingstream-batch unified machine learning algorithms, that can be easy-to-use andperformant with (near-) real-time latency.\n This release involves a major refactor of the earlier Flink ML library andintroduces major features that extend the Flink ML API and the iterationruntime, such as supporting stages with multi-input multi-output, graph-basedstage composition, and a new stream-batch unified iteration library. Moreover,we added five algorithm implementations in this release, which is the start ofa long-term initiative to provide a large number of off-the-shelf algorithms inFlink ML with state-of-the-art performance.\n We believe this release is an important step towards extending Apache Flink toa wide range of machine learning use cases, especially the real-time machinelearning scenarios.\n We encourage you to  download the release and share your feedback withthe community through the Flink  mailing lists or JIRA! We hope you like the newrelease and we\u2019d be eager to learn about your experience with it.\n     Stages in a machine learning workflow might take multiple inputs and returnmultiple outputs. For example, a graph embedding algorithm might need to readtwo tables, which represent the edge and node of the graph respectively. And aworkflow might need a stage that splits the input dataset into two outputdatasets, for training and testing respectively.\n With this capability, algorithm developers can assemble a machine learningworkflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of pre-defined stages. And thisworkflow can be configured and deployed without users knowing theimplementation details of this graph. This improvement could considerablyexpand the applicability and usability of Flink ML.\n  In a native online learning scenario, we have a long-running job that keepsprocessing training data and updating a machine learning model. And we couldhave multiple jobs deployed in web servers which do online inference. It isnecessary to transmit the latest model data from the training job to thoseinference jobs in (near-) real-time latency.\n The traditional Estimator/Transformer paradigm does not provide APIs to exposethis model data in a streaming manner. Users have to repeatedly call fit() toupdate model data. Although users might be able to update model data once everyfew minutes, it is likely very inefficient, if not impossible, to update modeldata once every few seconds with this approach.\n With FLIP-173,model data can be exposed as an unbounded stream via the getModelData() API.Then algorithm users can transfer the model data to web servers in real-timeand use the up-to-date model data to do online inference. This feature couldsignificantly strengthen Flink ML\u2019s capability to support online learningapplications.\n  We care a lot about usability and developer velocity in Flink ML. In thisrelease, we refactored and significantly simplified the experience of defining,getting and setting parameters for algorithms.\n With FLIP-174,parameters can be defined as static variables of an interface, and anyalgorithm that implements the interface could inherit these variabledefinitions without additional work. Commonly used parameter validators areprovided as part of the infrastructure.\n  One of the most useful tool in the existing ML libraries (e.g. Scikit-learn,Flink, Spark) is Pipeline,which allows users to compose an estimator from an ordered list of estimatorsand transformers, without having to explicitly implement the fit/transform forthe estimator/transformer.\n FLIP-175extended this capability from pipeline to DAG. Users can now compose anestimator from a DAG of estimator and transformers. This capability ofcomposition allows developers to slice a complex workflow into simpler modulesand re-use the modules across multiple workflows. We believe this capabilitycould significantly improve the experience of building and deploying complexworkflows using Flink ML.\n  To support training machine learning algorithms and adjust the model parametersdynamically based on the prediction result, it is necessary to have nativesupport for processing data iteratively. It is known that Flink uses DAG todescribe the process logic, thus we need to provide the iteration library ontop of Flink separately. Besides, since we need to support both offlinetraining and online training / adjustment, the iteration library should supportboth streaming and batch cases.\n FLIP-176 implements astream-batch unified iteration library. It provides the function oftransmitting records back to the precedent operators and the ability to trackthe progress of rounds inside the iteration. Users could directly useDataStream API and Table API to express the execution logic inside theiteration. Besides, the new iteration library also extends Flink\u2019scheckpointing mechanism to also support exactly-once failover for jobs usingiterations.\n  Nowadays many machine learning practitioners are used to developing machinelearning workflows in Python due to its ease-of-use and excellent ecosystem. Tomeet the needs of these users, a Python package dedicated for Flink ML iscreated starting from this release. The Python package currently provides APIssimilar to their Java counterparts for developing machine learning algorithms.\n   In the future we will enhance the Python SDK to enable its interoperabilitywith Flink ML\u2019s Java library, for example, allowing users to express machinelearning workflows in Python, where workflows consist of a mixture of stagesfrom the Flink ML Java library as well as stages implemented in Python (e.g. aTensorFlow program).\n  Now that the Flink ML API re-design is done, we started the initiative to addoff-the-shelf algorithms in Flink ML. As part of this initiative, we borrowedideas from the  Alink project, and workedclosely with developers of the Alink project to design the new Flink ML APIs,refactor, optimize and migrate algorithms from Alink to Flink. Our long-termgoal is to provide a library of performant algorithms that are easy to use,debug and customize for your needs.\n We have implemented five algorithms in this release, i.e. logistic regression,k-means, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes and one-hot encoder. For now thesealgorithms focus on validating the APIs and iteration runtime. In addition toadding more and more algorithms, we will also stress test and optimize theirperformance to make sure these algorithms have state-of-the-art performance.Stay tuned!\n   To accelerate the development of Flink ML, the effort has moved to the newrepository  flink-ml under the Flinkproject. We here follow a similar approach like the Stateful Functions effort,where a separate repository has helped to speed up the development by allowingfor more light-weight contribution workflows and separate release cycles.\n  To facilitate the community collaboration on ecosystem projects that extend thecapability of the Apache Flink, Apache Flink PMC has granted the permission touse flink-extended as the name of this  GitHuborganization, which provides a neutralplace to host the code of ecosystem projects.\n Two Flink ML related projects have been moved to this organization. dl-on-flink provides thecapability to implement Flink ML stages using TensorFlow. And clink is a library that facilitatesthe implementation of Flink ML stages using C++ in order to support e.g.real-time feature engineering.\n We hope you can join this effort and share your Flink ecosystem projects inthis Github organization. And stay tuned for more updates on ecosystemprojects.\n  Please review this note for a list of adjustments to make and issues to checkif you plan to upgrade to Flink ML 2.0.0.\n This note discusses any critical information about incompatibilities andbreaking changes, performance changes, and any other changes that might impactyour production deployment of Flink ML.\n FLIP-173made major changes to PipelineStage and its subclasses.

The rusting of iron is an example. Reddish iron oxide forms quickly on iron surfaces exposed to atmospheric oxygen, or O2.\n \u201cWhen you expose fresh crystalline surfaces from the sedimentary reservoir to O2, you get weathering that consumes oxygen,\u201d said Yan, a postdoctoral research associate in Rice\u2019s Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.\n Another way glaciers could promote the consumption of atmospheric oxygen is by exposing organic carbon that had been buried for millions of years, Yan said.\n  During Yan\u2019s Ph.D. studies in the labs of  Princeton University\u2019s Michael Bender and John Higgins, Yan worked on a 2016 study led by Daniel Stolper, now an assistant professor at the  University of California, Berkeley, that used  air bubbles in ice cores to show the proportion of oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere had declined by about 0.2% in the past 800,000 years.\n In the Science Advances study, Yan, Higgins and colleagues from Oregon State University, the University of Maine and the University of California, San Diego, analyzed bubbles in older ice cores to show the O2 dip began after the length of Earth\u2019s glacial cycles more than doubled around 1 million years ago.\n The ice age Earth is in today  began about 2.7 million years ago. Dozens of glacial cycles followed. In each, ice caps alternately grew, covering up to a third of the planet, and then retreated toward the poles. Each cycle lasted around 40,000 years until about 1 million years ago. At roughly the same time atmospheric oxygen began to decline, glacial cycles began lasting about 100,000 years.\n \u201cThe reason for the decline is the rate of O2 being produced is lower than the rate of O2 being consumed,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call the source and the sink. The source is what produces O2, and the sink is what consumes or drags on O2. In the study, we interpret the decline to be a stronger drag on O2, meaning more is being consumed.\u201d\n  Yan said Earth\u2019s biosphere didn\u2019t contribute to the decline because it is balanced, drawing as much O2 from the atmosphere as it produces. Weathering, on a global scale, is the most likely geological process capable of consuming enough excess O2 to account for the decline, and Yan and colleagues considered two scenarios for increased weathering.\n Global sea level falls when glaciers are advancing and rises when they retreat. When the length of glacial cycles more than doubled, so did the magnitude of swings in sea level. As coastlines advanced, land previously covered by water would have been exposed to the oxidizing power of atmospheric O2.\n \u201cWe did some calculations to see how much oxygen that might consume and found it could only account for about a quarter of the observed decrease,\u201d Yan said.\n Because the extent of ice coverage isn\u2019t precisely known for each glacial cycle, there\u2019s a wider range of uncertainty about the magnitude of chemical weathering from glacial erosion. But Yan said the evidence suggests it could draw enough oxygen to account for the decline.\n \u201cOn a global scale, it\u2019s very hard to pinpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we did some tests about how much additional weathering would be needed to account for the O2 decline, and it\u2019s not unreasonable. Theoretically, it could account for the magnitude of what\u2019s been observed.\u201d\n Reference: \u201cIce core evidence for atmospheric oxygen decline since the Mid-Pleistocene transition\u201d by Yuzhen Yan, Edward J.
