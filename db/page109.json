It&#39;s had its ups and downs, from the era of net splits to the era of cancel culture. However, we&#39;re proud to announce that we&#39;ve completely obliterated the swamp removing the shackles on progress, and now we&#39;re sailing blue seas. YaRR!\n   The freenode digital autonomous zone is proud to announce IRC.com by freenode. In addition to our FOSS and free IRC bouncer service that keeps you connected 24/7, we now provide Android and iOS applications that connect to our freenode bouncer, enabling push notifications, avatars and a whole other suite of IRCv3 capabilities!\n Head on over to the  Android Play store or the  iOS App store and download, install and login! Share it with your friends as IRC and FOSS are no longer walled gardens - freedom is for everyone with no phone number required!\n For those of you that know what an API is and don&#39;t think it&#39;s a typo for a fruity company, there&#39;s webhooks built in so you can immediately integrate freenode and IRC.com into your development and org processes.\n The app is in  beta, but everything works. If you find any bugs, please let us know in  #freenode-bnc!\n  On the desktop and web, you can use your favorite desktop or web client to connect to the same connection that your iOS and Android apps are on. Simply use the freenode bnc. Use server  bnc.freenode.net with port  6697 and SSL enabled. Then, enter your  username:password in the connection password field and connect.\n We also deployed our  webchat. As of now it connects directly to freenode, but we will soon be adding IRC.com by freenode features which means it will connect to the freenode bnc in the future!\n  Now that IRC is up to speed with modern messaging clients, we&#39;re now aiming to take things further yet. IRC is a much more robust and useable messaging platform than anything else out there. We&#39;re just getting started.\n Special thanks goes out to tjr and his team, as well as the entire  freenode staff as we worked through the transition from legacy to present. An additional special thanks goes out to prawnsalad, who&#39;s previous contributions to the FOSS and IRC community, including the Kiwi IRC suite of FOSS, made all of this possible.\n The power of the people cannot be stopped. freenode is here to stay, no matter what gets thrown at it. It&#39;s now, as well, a recognized digital autonomous zone which gives it the unique ability to provide what freenode does best: freedom.\n freenode is IRC. freenode is FOSS. freenode is freedom. Ask not what you can do for freenode, but what freenode will do for you.

This is somewhat daunting for me, as speech coding is R&amp;D, which tends to be very open ended; it\u2019s possible to work for months with no clear outcomes. In contrast the modem work is straight forward engineering, and I get the positive feedback of \u201chaving stuff work\u201d on a regular basis.\n So I\u2019m trying to time box the speech coding projects to a few days work each. This is quite a personal challenge, as there are just so many variables and paths to follow. It\u2019s so easy to go off on a tangent and watch the months pass!\n In this particular project I\u2019m looking at the Codec 2 700C Vector Quantiser (VQ), and exploring ways to make it more inherently robust to high pass and low pass filtering at the edges of the spectrum. The broad goal is to improve speech quality at a given bit rate, or support a lower bit rate at the same speech quality. I\u2019m targeting bit rates in the 600 bit/s range, and the lower end of the quality range (communications quality speech).\n  It\u2019s well known that the most important speech information is between 300 and 3000 Hz. Energy outside that range makes the speech sounds nicer, but doesn\u2019t help intelligibility much. Analog modes such as SSB exploit this by band limiting the speech so that the transmitter power is used just to punch through information in the narrow bandwidth that matters.\n With digital speech the RF bandwidth is not directly linked to the bandwidth of the decoded speech. For example FreeDV 700D uses around 1100 Hz of RF bandwidth, but the decoded speech has energy covering most of the 0 to 4000 Hz range.\n Codec 2 encodes and transmits the speech spectrum on a regular basis. As well as encoding parts of the spectrum necessary for intelligibility, it also has to encode other features, such as the high pass and low pass roll off the microphone and analog filters in the sound card. These features don\u2019t carry any intelligibility, but bits are consumed to encode them. When you have just 28 bits/frame \u2013 every bit matters!\n Turns out that some of the wilder variations in the speech spectrum from different sources of speech are in the 0-300Hz and 3000-4000Hz regions, for example different high pass or low pass filtering for a particular microphone or sound card. This can upset the Codec 2 quantiser, e.g. it might expend bits modelling a particular low pass filter response \u2013 lowering the quality of the perceptually important 300-3000 Hz information.\n So I\u2019ve prototyped a Vector Quantiser (VQ) that just uses the information in the 300-3000 Hz range to quantise the speech spectrum. However the VQ is trained on the full range, so it uses that full range to synthesise the speech, hopefully recovering some of the extended spectrum. There is also a limiter before the VQ to reduce the dynamic range of the frames.\n Here are some samples processed with the newamp1 two stage VQ, and the new subset VQ. Like the newamp1 algorithm, it works on vectors of K=20 mel-spaced magnitude samples. The speech codec is only partially quantised (10ms frames, original phase, unquantised pitch), so it would sound worse in a real world fully quantised codec. The \u201cnewamp1\u201d algorithm is used for Codec 2 700C [1] (and employed in FreeDV 700C/D/E), and uses 22 bit/frame (550 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate). The subset VQ uses just 12 bits frame (300 bits/s at a 40ms frame rate).\n  There are some samples where newamp1 sounds louder \u2013 this could be due to the gain limiter stage in the subset algorithm constraining the dynamic range. There also seems to be more high frequency response with newamp1, indicating subset is not recovering the high frequency speech energy as I had hoped. Both are quite intelligible, and acceptable for communications quality speech.\n   Both the samples and objective results show the subset VQ is holding up OK next to the reference newamp1, despite the low bit rate. I\u2019ve found that around 9 dB*dB spectral distortion gives acceptable results for my (low communications quality) use case.\n I tried adding an artificial low pass filter above 3400 Hz to a couple of the input samples, to simulate what might happen from different microphones.\n  It seems to work OK with the low pass filtered input samples, they sound pretty similar to the sample using the original source (one of the goals of this work):\n   I\u2019m surprised that a single stage VQ is working quite well at just 12 bits/frame. It\u2019s also encoding both the average frame energy and the spectral shape (I use a separate scalar quantiser for frame energy in newamp1). This is quite optimal from a VQ theory point of view, but sometimes not possible due to practical concerns such as the storage/CPU requirements for a single stage VQ.\n  Try a few more samples, and push this work through to a fully quantised speech codec.\n Seeing it\u2019s doing well with a single stage, it would interesting to see if it sounds better with multiple stages.\n A single stage VQ enables other tricks, like non-FEC techniques to make the VQ robust to bit errors, such as sorting the VQ indexes [2] or Neural Net style training with bit errors.\n  [1]  Codec 2 700C [2]  Codec 2 at 450 bits/s.

"note_en": "The most accurate distance measurement yet of ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF2 (DF2) confirms beyond any shadow of a doubt that it is lacking in dark matter. The newly measured distance of 22.1 +/-1.2 megaparsecs was obtained by an international team of researchers led by Zili Shen and Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University and Shany Danieli, a NASA Hubble Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.    &#34;Determining an accurate distance to DF2 has been key in supporting our earlier results,&#34; stated Danieli. &#34;The new measurement reported in this study has crucial implications for estimating the physical properties of the galaxy, thus confirming its lack of  .&#34;\n  The results, published in  Astrophysical Journal Letters on June 9, 2021, are based on 40 orbits of NASA&#39;s Hubble Space Telescope, with imaging by the Advanced Camera for Surveys and a &#39;tip of the red giant branch&#39; (TRGB) analysis, the gold standard for such refined measurements. In 2019, the team published results measuring the distance to neighboring UDG NGC1052-DF4 (DF4) based on 12 Hubble orbits and TRGB analysis, which provided compelling evidence of missing dark matter. This preferred method expands on the team&#39;s 2018 studies that relied on &#34;surface brightness fluctuations&#34; to gage distance. Both galaxies were discovered with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array at the New Mexico Skies observatory.\n  &#34;We went out on a limb with our initial Hubble observations of this galaxy in 2018,&#34; van Dokkum said. &#34;I think people were right to question it because it&#39;s such an unusual result. It would be nice if there were a simple explanation, like a wrong distance. But I think it&#39;s more fun and more interesting if it actually is a weird galaxy.&#34;\n  In addition to confirming earlier distance findings, the Hubble results indicated that the galaxies were located slightly farther away than previously thought, strengthening the case that they contain little to no dark matter. If DF2 were closer to Earth, as some astronomers claim, it would be intrinsically fainter and less massive, and the galaxy would need dark matter to account for the observed effects of the total mass.\n   Dark matter is widely considered to be an essential ingredient of galaxies, but this study lends further evidence that its presence may not be inevitable. While dark matter has yet to be directly observed, its gravitational influence is like a glue that holds galaxies together and governs the motion of visible matter. In the case of DF2 and DF4, researchers were able to account for the motion of stars based on stellar mass alone, suggesting a lack or absence of dark matter. Ironically, the detection of galaxies deficient in dark matter will likely help to reveal its puzzling nature and provide new insights into galactic evolution.\n    While DF2 and DF4 are both comparable in size to the Milky Way galaxy, their total masses are only about one percent of the Milky Way&#39;s mass. These ultra-diffuse galaxies were also found to have a large population of especially luminous globular clusters.\n  This research has generated a great deal of scholarly interest, as well as energetic debate among proponents of alternative theories to dark matter, such as modified newtonian dynamics (MOND). However, with the team&#39;s most recent findings\u2014including the relative distances of the two UDGs to NGC1052\u2014such alternative theories seem less likely. Additionally, there is now little uncertainty in the team&#39;s distance measurements given the use of the TRGB method. Based on fundamental physics, this method depends on the observation of red giant stars that emit a flash after burning through their helium supply that always happens at the same brightness.\n  &#34;There&#39;s a saying that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the new distance measurement strongly supports our previous finding that DF2 is missing dark matter,&#34; stated Shen. &#34;Now it&#39;s time to move beyond the distance debate and focus on how such galaxies came to exist.&#34;\n  Moving forward, researchers will continue to hunt for more of these oddball galaxies, while considering a number of questions such as: How are UDGs formed? What do they tell us about standard cosmological models? How common are these galaxies, and what other unique properties do they have? It will take uncovering many more dark-matter-lacking   to resolve these mysteries and the ultimate question of what dark matter really is.

", "note_en": "Dr. Rhonda Patrick proposes a mechanism for the phospholipid form of DHA to play a role in the prevention of APOE4-associated Alzheimer&#39;s Disease.\n  Dr. Rhonda Patrick recently published a paper on the  Role of Phosphatidylcholine-DHA in preventing APOE4-associated Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n  DHA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid and plays a vital role in the prevention and reversal of cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\n The form of DHA found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil is primarily in phospholipid form and this form is broken down to DHA-lysoPC\n The form of DHA found in DHA/fish oil supplements is not in phospholipid form and is primarily broken down to free DHA\n APOE4 carriers have impaired free DHA transport into the brain because of APOE4-mediated degradation of the blood brain barrier, but this degradation does not impair how DHA-lysoPC enters the brain\n Dr. Rhonda Patrick proposes that consuming DHA in phospholipid form may be a strategy for APOE4 carriers to get DHA into the brain and prevent APOE4-associated Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, which is found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil but not in fish oil supplements\n  What is Alzheimer\u2019s Disease? Alzheimer&#39;s Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. Key Characteristics: memory loss, spatial disorientation, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral changes.\n Alzheimer&#39;s Disease and Age: Risk for AD doubles every 5 years, following the age of 65, and around 1/3 of people over 85 have AD.\n Genetic Risks: Three common isoforms of the APOE(2, 3, 4) gene, each associated with different AD risks. In regard to AD, APOE4 is what we are concerned about. We carry two alleles of one single gene, meaning we can carry either one or two APOE4 alleles. About 1/4 of the population has at least one APOE4 allele. ~65\u201380% of people with AD have at least one APOE4 allele.\n  However, APOE4 does not guarantee you will get AD and not having APOE4 doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get AD. Interestingly, APOE4 is associated with better cognition and intelligence early in life but earlier decline as we age (an example of antagonistic pleiotropy).\n  The APOE gene codes for the APOE protein. This protein is made in the brain and peripheral tissues but plays similar roles for both in lipid and cholesterol transport.\n In peripheral tissue, APOE is synthesized in the liver and regulates lipid and cholesterol transport to tissues and reverse cholesterol transport (from peripheral tissues back to the liver first via the lymphatic system, then the bloodstream).\n  In the Brain, APOE is synthesized by astrocytes and regulates lipid and cholesterol transport to neurons. APOE2 and APOE3 are expressed 2\u20134 times more in neurons than APOE4, therefore APOE4 has reduced lipid and cholesterol transport to neurons.\n  1. Extracellular Amyloid-\u00df Plaques As we age, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation accumulates in the brain and this is taken care of via the activation of microglial cells (brain\u2019s immune cells). Acutely, microglial cell activation is good, chronic activation is bad. In AD, they are chronically activated by a protein called amyloid-\u00df42, which is a product of full-length amyloid-\u00df cleavage. This triggers a vicious cycle because microglial activation leads to further production of amyloid-\u00df plaques, and thus more amyloid-\u00df42 product. When amyloid-\u00df plaques form these aggregations, they interfere with neuronal communication, disrupting or destroying it.\n  Glymphatic System: activated when we sleep and removes waste products from the brain, including amyloid-\u00df plaques. A lack of sleep = less glymphatic activation = less amyloid-\u00df plaque clearance.\n APOE-mediated Mechanism: APOE binds amyloid-\u00df42 and removes it from the cell. The APOE4 isoform, besides producing less APOE protein, also binds amyloid-\u00df42 with a 20-fold lower affinity than APOE3. This mechanism is therefore very ineffective for APOE4 carriers.\n Sleep matters more for APOE4 carriers since they must rely on only one clearance system (glymphatic  system)\n In short: chronic activation of our brain\u2019s immune cells leads to amyloid-\u00df plaque build up, and clearance is impaired in APOE4 carriers.\n 2. Intracellular Neurofibrillary Tangles: If that looks like gibberish to you, don\u2019t worry that\u2019s what I felt I was typing. These are also referred to as tau tangles, because they are aggregates of tau proteins. These are inside the neurons of patients with AD, whereas the amyloid-\u00df plaques are outside the cell. Tau tangles interfere with how cellular components are transferred inside neurons, and therefore limits energy to the cell needed to form new synapses and maintain those previously formed. Eventually, neurons succumb to this energy deficit resulting in long-term memory loss and neuronal cell death.\n In short: aggregates of tau proteins form tau tangles inside neurons and result in long-term memory loss and neuronal cell death.\n 3. Reduced Brain Glucose Uptake Between our blood and the brain is the blood brain barrier (BBB). Within the BBB are transporters that shuttle glucose into our brain, these are called GLUT transporters (specifically GLUT1 and GLUT3). Neurons rely on GLUT transporters because they cannot store or produce glucose themselves.\n APOE4 carriers typically have downregulation of GLUT transporters, and therefore reduced brain glucose uptake is more prevalent in these individuals.\n A lack of glucose to the brain also contributes to the formation of tau tangles. After a tau protein is translated (produced from its associated mRNA), it is modified in a glucose-dependent manner, and once modified, negatively regulates its phosphorylation. Without this modification, which occurs with reduced brain glucose uptake, tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated (since it has nothing negatively regulating this now), and this renders tau proteins pretty useless in addition to promoting their aggregation and formation of tau tangles.\n In short:  APOE4 carriers have reduced brain glucose uptake (which is more pronounced as we age) because APOE4 downregulates the transport of glucose into the brain.\n  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is one of the essential omega-3 fatty acids (the other important one is EPA and to a lesser extent, ALA). It accounts for just shy of 1/3 of the brain\u2019s lipids, so it\u2019s presence is pretty critical. Unfortunately, the body cannot produce DHA on its own, and it must be acquired through the diet.\n        Regardless of APOE status, dietary fish and seafood intake slows AD progression and improves all three pathological characteristics of AD. Interestingly, DHA supplementation does not show these effects in APOE4 carriers, but does in non-carriers.\n Why would fish improve cognitive function in APOE4carriers but supplementing with DHA does not? Dr. Rhonda Patrick suggests that the reason for this is because DHA in fish is in phospholipid form, whereas in a DHA supplement it is not.\n  Phospholipid form of DHA (found in fish) is metabolized to lysophosphatidylcholine (DHA-lysoPC) Non-phospholipid form of DHA (found in DHA supplements) is metabolized to non-esterfied DHA (free DHA)\n The transport of these two types of DHA use different transport mechanisms for entry into the brain. Therefore, Dr. Patrick suggests that the transport of free DHA into the brain of APOE4 carriers is impaired, but the transport of DHA-lysoPC, is not.\n Dr. Rhonda Patrick\u2019s proposal: Providing the brain of APOE4 carriers with DHA-lysoPC may be a way to bypass defective free DHA transport into the brain.\n DHA-lysoPC may in fact be the brain\u2019s preferred source of DHA and it\u2019s been reported that those with low levels of the precursor to DHA-lysoPC can predict mild dementia and AD with 90% accuracy, regardless of APOE4 status.\n In short: the type of DHA found in fish, fish roe, and krill oil has a better chance of getting into the brain of APOE4 carriers.\n  APOE4 in the brain breaks down the integrity and permeability of the BBB through multiple different mechanisms ultimately rendering free DHA transport into the brain very limited. It also decreases cerebral vascularization (i.e. blood supply to the brain). Specifically, APOE4 degrades the tight junctions of the BBB which disrupts the outer membrane leaflet used by free DHA to enter the brain.\n Free DHA improves cognitive function in young APOE4 carriers, but not in older individuals, indicating that age is a factor in the APOE4-mediated deterioration of the BBB.\n In short: the type of DHA in fish oil supplements can not adequately enter the brain in APOE4 carriers, especially in older individuals.\n  Trick question, it doesn\u2019t. DHA-LysoPC bypasses the tight junctions of the BBB and enters the brain via the inner membrane leaflet, therefore regardless of APOE status, DHA-LysoPC should enter the brain despite any degradation caused by APOE4.\n The form of DHA becomes very critical for APOE4 carriers, because this dictates DHA\u2019s entry into our brain.\n  Fish contain ~1\u20131.5% of their omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form but fish oil\n Fish roe from salmon, herring, pollock, and flying fish contain high amounts (~38\u201375%) of their omega-3 fatty acids in phospholipid form (mostly as phosphatidylcholine)\n  In phospholipid form, whether DHA is attached to the first or second carbon of the glycerol backbone dictates its break down.\n    This has a much greater chance of accumulating in HDL than LDL, therefore a much greater chance of generating DHA-lysoPC\n  These forms are broken down by pancreatic lipases in the intestines and can both generate free DHA and DHA-lysoPC depending on whether it is resecreted into LDL or HDL, respectively. Compared to the fate of DHA at the sn1 position in phospholipid form, these forms do not generate DHA-lysoPC (the end product we want!) to the same extent. Dr. Patrick suggests the possibility that high dose DHA supplementation could increase the generation of DHA-lysoPC.\n Phospholipid form ends up in circulation as DHA-lysoPC more rapidly than consumption in triglyceride form\n DHA is delivered to the brain in greater abundance when consumed in phospholipid form versus triglyceride\n In summary, APOE4 limits the transport of free DHA (from DHA supplements) into the brain, therefore consuming DHA in phospholipid form to generate DHA-lysoPC (e.g. fish, fish roe, and krill oil) may bypass this faulty transport in APOE4 carriers.",

"note_en": "Lauren Weber and Hannah Recht\t Many covid vaccination registration and information websites at the federal, state and local levels violate disability rights laws, hindering the ability of blind people to sign up for a potentially lifesaving vaccine, a KHN investigation has found.\n Across the country, people who use special software to make the web accessible have been unable to sign up for the vaccines or obtain vital information about covid-19 because many government websites lack required accessibility features. At least 7.6 million people in the U.S. over age 16 have a  visual disability.\n WebAIM, a nonprofit web accessibility organization, checked covid vaccine websites gathered by KHN from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On Jan. 27, it found accessibility issues on nearly all of 94 webpages, which included general vaccine information, lists of vaccine providers and registration forms.\n In at least seven states, blind residents said they were unable to register for the vaccine through their state or local governments without help. Phone alternatives, when available, have been beset with their own issues, such as long hold times and not being available at all hours like websites.\n Even the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s  Vaccine Administration Management System, which a small number of states and counties opted to use after its  rocky rollout, has been inaccessible for blind users.\n Those problems violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which established the right to communications in an accessible format, multiple legal experts and disability advocates said. The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, a civil rights law that prohibits governments and private businesses from discriminating based on disability, further enshrined this protection in 1990.\n Doris Ray, 72, who is blind and has a significant hearing impairment, ran into such issues when she tried to sign up for a vaccine last month with the CDC\u2019s system, used by Arlington County in Virginia. As the outreach director for the  ENDependence Center of Northern Virginia, an advocacy center run by and for people with disabilities, she had qualified for the vaccine because of her in-person work with clients.\n When she used screen-reading technology, which reads a website\u2019s text aloud, the drop-down field to identify her county did not work. She was unable to register for over two weeks, until a colleague helped her.\n \u201cThis is outrageous in the time of a public health emergency, that blind people aren\u2019t able to access something to get vaccinated,\u201d Ray said.\n Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind, wrote to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department in early December, laying out his concerns on vaccine accessibility.\n \u201cA national emergency does not exempt federal, state, and local governments from providing equal access,\u201d  he wrote.\n Dr. Robert Redfield, who was then leading the CDC,  responded that the interim vaccine playbook for health departments included a reminder of the legal requirements for accessible information.\n CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed said in an email that VAMS is compliant with federal accessibility laws and that the agency requires testing of its services.\n But more than two months into a national vaccine campaign, those on the ground report problems at all levels.\n Some local officials who use VAMS are aware of the ongoing problems and blame the federal government. Arlington Assistant County Manager Bryna Helfer said that because VAMS is run by the federal government the county cannot access the internal workings to troubleshoot the system for blind residents.\n Connecticut Department of Public Health spokesperson Maura Fitzgerald said the state was aware of \u201cmany accessibility issues\u201d with VAMS. She said it had staffed up its call center to handle the problems and was working with the federal government \u201cto improve VAMS and enable the functionality that was promised.\u201d\n Deanna O\u2019Brien, president of the National Federation of the Blind of New Hampshire, said she had heard from blind people unable to use the system. New Hampshire\u2019s health department did not answer KHN questions about the problems.\n Blind people are particularly vulnerable to contracting the covid virus because they often cannot physically distance themselves from others.\n \u201cWhen I go to the grocery store, I do not have the option of walking around and not being near a person,\u201d said  Albert Elia, a blind attorney who works with the San Francisco-based TRE Legal Practice on accessibility cases. \u201cI need a person at the store to assist me in shopping.\u201d\n There is no standardized way to register for a covid vaccine nationwide \u2014 or fix the online accessibility problems. Some states use VAMS; some states have centralized online vaccination registration sites; others have a mix of state-run and locally run websites, or leave it all to local health departments or hospitals. Ultimately, state and local governments are responsible for making their vaccination systems accessible, whether they use the VAMS system or not.\n \u201cOnce those portals open, it\u2019s a race to see who can click the fastest,\u201d Riccobono said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do things like file a lawsuit, because, at the end of the day, we need to fix it today.\u201d\n Common programming failures that make sites hard to use for the visually impaired included text without enough contrast to distinguish words from the page\u2019s background and images without alternative text explaining what they showed, the WebAIM survey showed. Even worse, portions of the forms on 19 states\u2019 pages were built so that screen readers couldn\u2019t decipher what information a user should enter on search bars or vaccine registration forms.\n The new vaccine pages had more errors than states\u2019  main coronavirus pages but slightly fewer than state government websites in general, said WebAIM Associate Director Jared Smith.\n In Alameda County, California, when Bryan Bashin, 65, who is blind and CEO of the LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco, tried to sign up on Feb. 9 for his vaccine appointment, he encountered multiple hurdles. The appointments slipped away. That night he received an email from the city of Berkeley offering vaccinations. But after two hours struggling with its inaccessible website, all the slots were again taken, he said in an email.\n He was only able to get an appointment after his sighted sister signed him up and has since received his first shot.\n \u201cIt\u2019s an awful bit of discrimination, one as stinging as anything I\u2019ve experienced,\u201d Bashin said.\n Susan Jones, a blind 69-year-old in Indianapolis, had to rely on the Aira app, which allows a sighted person to operate her computer remotely, when she tried to register for her vaccine appointment.\n \u201cI resent that the assumption is that a sighted fairy godmother ought to be there at all times,\u201d said Sheela Gunn-Cushman, a 49-year-old also in Alameda County, who also had to rely on Aira to complete preregistration for a vaccine.\n Emily Creasy, 23, a visually impaired woman in Polk County, Oregon, said she tried unsuccessfully for a month to make the scheduling apparatus work with her screen reader. She finally received her first shot after her mother and roommate helped her.\n Even  Sachin Dev Pavithran, 43, who is blind and executive director of the U.S. Access Board, an independent agency of the federal government that works to increase accessibility, said he struggled to access vaccine registration information in Logan, Utah.\n The Indiana Health Department, Public Health Division of Berkeley and Oregon\u2019s Polk County Public Health did not respond to requests for comment. Utah\u2019s Bear River Health Department did not answer questions on the issue.\n After Alameda County received complaints from users that its site was not compatible with screen readers, officials decided to move away from its preregistration technology, Health Department spokesperson Neetu Balram said in mid-February. The county has since switched to a new form.\n If vaccine accessibility issues are not fixed across the country, though, lawsuits could come next, Elia said. Members of the blind community recently won landmark lawsuits against  Domino\u2019s Pizza and the  Winn-Dixie grocery chain after being unable to order online.\n And, Elia said, \u201cthis is not ordering a pizza \u2014 this is being able to get a potentially lifesaving vaccine.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 07:12:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75ab\u82d7,vaccine", "title": "Covid\u75ab\u82d7\u7f51\u7ad9\u8fdd\u53cd\u6b8b\u75be\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f2\u4eba\u521b\u9020\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73 ", "title_en": "Covid Vaccine Websites Violate Disability Laws, Create Inequity for the Blind", "transed": 1, "url": "https://khn.org/news/article/covid-vaccine-websites-violate-disability-laws-create-inequity-for-the-blind/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75ab\u82d7", "vaccine"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067102, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u9c9c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u62e5\u6709\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4e86\u89e3FreeBSD\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7aef\u53e3\uff0c\u5305\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u672f\u8bed\u5982\u4f55\u3002\n                                                    8420be8 net / py-pyroute2.protocols\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyoute2.protocols 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f8\u5173\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7eafpython netlink\u5e93.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/ Pyroute2.Protocols.\n 78c72c5 net / py-pyroute2.nslink\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.nslink 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafpython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f51\u7ba1\uff0cnspopen\u548cremotesocket\u7c7b.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree /master/pyroute2.nslink.\n 89717eb net / py-pyroute2.nftables\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.nftables 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u5e38\u57fa\u672c\u7684nftables api.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master /pyroute2.nftables.\n 7942185 net / py-pyroute2.ndb\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyoute2.ndb 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u7eafpython netlink library.ndb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f51\u7edc\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u5b83\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8b\u52a1\u6027DB\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u5730RTNL\u6e90\u5230NetNS\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002 Thedb\u63d0\u4f9bPython API\u548cHTTP RPC\uff08JSON\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u4f5c\u4e3aAsstandalone\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5cPython\u6a21\u5757.www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.ndb\n CE3DF07 NET / PY-PYROUTE2.MINIMAL\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.minimal 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Pyroute2\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u53ea\u6709NetLink Parser\uff0c\u57fa\u672cNetns\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4e00\u4e9bNetLink\u534f\u8bae\u5b9e\u73b0.www\uff1ahttps\uff1a//github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.minimal\n 42c316c net / py-pyroute2.ipset\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.ipset 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u4f9bipset\u548cwiset\u7c7b.www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master /pyroute2.ipset. \n580738D net / py-pyroute2.core\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-pyroute2.core 0.6.4pyroute2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eafPython netlink\u5e93\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86NetLink\u89e3\u6790\u5668\u548c\u51e0\u4e2aNetLinkSocket\uff0c\u5305\u62ecRTNL\uff08IProute\uff09\uff0cWioguard\uff0cMPTCP\u7b49 .www\uff1ahttps://github.com/svinota/pyroute2/tree/master/pyroute2.core.  5560319 devel / py-telepath\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0py-telepath 0.2telepath\u662f\u4e00\u4e2adjango\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728Python\u548cJavaScript\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u63a5\u53e3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5546\u4e1a\u903b\u8f91.www\uff1ahttps\uff1ahttps\uff1ahttps\uff1a //github.com/wagtail/telepath.  4e2f517 devel / jsonnet\uff1a\u66f4\u65b0\u52300.17.0-\u4f7f\u7528cmake\u6765\u6784\u5efa - \u6dfb\u52a0c ++ lib\u548c\u6807\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9759\u6001libs-\u4f7f\u7528porter\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Porsche is setting up a new factory for battery cells, called Cellforce, in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. The plant will be run as a subsidiary of Porsche in a joint venture with Customcells\u00a0and will develop  cells that use silicon as opposed to graphite for the anode material.\n &#34;We already started within research and pre-development to build up know how and knowledge about cell chemistry, and the company Cellforce Group will have around 60 engineers in development and about 20 in production; the main focus, at least in the beginning, is to take care about the development of the cell and cell chemistry,&#34; said Michael Steiner, member of the executive board, R&amp;D at Porsche.\n But unlike other  recent battery factory announcements, the goal for Cellforce is high performance, not high volume.\n &#34;In terms of production, [it] will be small compared to all the gigafactories you know, so we are looking forward to have around 100 MWh a year as production capacity\u2014it could be slightly more,&#34; Steiner told Ars. &#34;In terms of cars it should fit for, let me say, 1,000 cars a year. The kind of cells we look for are designed for motorsports and for high-performance derivatives of existing cars, so it&#39;s a very tailored cell technology for high-performance solutions,&#34; he said.\n    &#34;If this works, and we see potential to come down with cost if we scale up\u2014and costs of sales have not only to do with the chemistry but also with the scaling\u2014there might be a chance for higher volume, but this is not a task that I gave the team that has to start this new facility,&#34; Steiner said.\n Porsche is looking for gains in both gravimetric and volumetric energy density but also wants cells that can run hotter than current lithium-ion, like the cells found in Porsche&#39;s Taycan. These currently use &#34;low single-digit percentage&#34; of silicon in the anodes, but Cellforce wants to  increase this to 50 percent if possible.\n &#34;Today&#39;s cell chemistry is able to [operate at] 50\u02da C, maybe slightly higher, and we are looking for temperatures above 70\u02da C that support superfast charging but also superfast driving,&#34; Steiner said. (A downside to the new chemistry is that it doesn&#39;t operate well below freezing, which is a problem for road cars but not for race cars.)\n Porsche wasn&#39;t ready to discuss exactly what race car might first use these new Cellforce cells, something that should happen around 2024. By that time, Porsche&#39;s  hybrid endurance racing program will be up and running alongside its Formula E team.

said Horn, who lived in Oakland before moving into her van. &#34;I had no reason, nothing, tying me to that specific location or that amount of rent.&#34;\n Horn is not alone. Many workers with jobs that let them work remotely during the pandemic left behind their sedentary housing situations and moved full-time into vans. These remote workers drive from location to location in their homes, working from internet hotspots in their vans and spending their free time in nature and exploring new places.\n As vaccines roll out and states start to open up, some workers are returning to their offices. But many workers who&#39;ve adopted the van life don&#39;t want to give it up.\n &#34;It&#39;s become a lifestyle,&#34; said Smriti Bhadauria, who lives in her van with her husband Kartik Vasan and their dog Everest. Bhadauria and Vasan have been traveling in their 1977 Dodge B200 Tradesman since leaving Toronto in August 2020.\n &#34;We&#39;re extremely happy in this life and the freedom it gives,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;There&#39;s no deadline in sight.&#34;\n Like overseas backpacking, van life appeals to those with a love for travel or the outdoors who have the privilege to work remotely and the budget to spend thousands of dollars buying and setting up their vans. They can shift the money from rent and car payments toward a lifestyle of endless travel.\n &#34;I&#39;ve always been somebody who loves to travel, but I&#39;m definitely a homebody at the same time,&#34; said Cailey Dillon, who works remotely in customer service for Outdoorsy, a van and RV rental company. &#34;I really like that with the van life you can always be traveling but your home is always with you.&#34;\n       For some, working out of a van is less about travel and more of an alternative to leasing an office.\n Kenzo Fong, CEO of tech start-up Rock, began working out of his van in May 2020 after his children began doing their schoolwork at home during the pandemic. Fong still lives in his San Francisco home, but during the days, he gets into his van and picks a new location in the city. Fong spends his day working out of the desk he&#39;s set up in his van, and takes walking breaks to enjoy the variety of locations and gather his thoughts.\n Fong prefers this to having an hour-long commute each way from San Francisco to Mountain View, California, as he did for his previous job at Google.\n &#34;I just can&#39;t imagine myself doing that again because there&#39;s so much flexibility working from anywhere,&#34; said Fong, whose company builds software for remote workers.\n        Buying and setting up a van can be a quick process. But people who really get into it can spend months or years getting set up.\n Fong, for example, bought an already-converted van and financed it, and pays a couple hundred dollars each month.\n  In contrast, Horn spent months working on her van with her dad and a contractor, setting up the van to the specifications that she wanted. By the end of the project, she had spent about $60,000 -- $25,000 for a used van and another approximate $35,000 on the build.\n Van life vehicles need a few basics: A place to sleep, a desk or table space, kitchen equipment and some sort of bathroom setup.\n But perhaps most important is the computer and internet equipment. Some van lifers only need a laptop. Others have more elaborate set ups complete with multiple monitors. But most carry at least two hot spots from different network providers so they can catch signal from at least one of the services as they hit new locations.\n &#34;Internet is the most important thing,&#34; said Fong, who has a hotspot for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. &#34;I basically have all the major carriers in case I need it.&#34;\n These internet requirements sometimes necessitate innovative solutions. Horn recounts finding a great campsite in Sedona, Arizona, but not finding a good signal. So every morning she drove 30 minutes to a nearby town and parked in front of a Staples store where she could finally get a strong connection.\n  Working a nine-to-five job can also be a nuisance for van life workers. For full-timers like Horn, a typical work schedule means they might be parked somewhere gorgeous without being able to enjoy it until the weekend.\n This is why many in the van lifestyle are freelance workers, said Jess Shisler, the founder of Sekr, an app that helps people who live in vans find campsites or wi-fi locations.\n &#34;A nine-to-five is hard but doable,&#34; said Shisler, who also lives in a van. &#34;The type of remote careers that allow you more flexibility of your schedule are easier to do in this lifestyle.&#34;\n  Vasan works in information technology while Bhadauria has a digital marketing job. The two spend the early hours of their days outdoors and then get straight to work. In the afternoon, they&#39;ll take a break from work and explore their area or drive to their next location. No matter what, they prioritize catching the sunset every evening. Ironically, much of their actual work gets done on Saturday and Sunday.\n &#34;We almost never do activities on the weekends because it&#39;s usually crowded, so weekends end up being work days for us,&#34; Vasan said.\n   Dillon said she was surprised at how dirty her van gets. She spent the first four months of 2021 living on the road, and she is now home in Platte City, Missouri, working and preparing to purchase an upgraded van so she can return to her travels sometime this summer. While living in her van, she would clean and clean, but the van would get dirty again as soon as the wind blew. Eventually, Dillon said, you just learn to live a little bit dirtier.\n Another big challenge is dealing with the loneliness that comes with living on the road. Dillon said she felt very lonely during her first three weeks on the road, and it wasn&#39;t until she got her dog Koda that she began to overcome that.\n &#34;I like to be a loner, but it does sometimes get a little too lonely,&#34; she said. &#34;Getting my dog really helped a lot with that loneliness.&#34;\n       Horn said she spends parts of her days doing van chores, such as cleaning and making her bed each day. She also has to empty the van&#39;s grey water tank and portable toilet and refill her fresh water and propane.\n &#34;Most of the moments are not those epic sleeping in the most amazing place and waking up to the most amazing view, it&#39;s very little of that in the grand majority, especially if you&#39;re working,&#34; Horn said. &#34;However, those moments make it worth it.&#34;\n Bhadauria, who travels with her husband and dog, says she doesn&#39;t get lonely, but there are times when she misses the friends that come with living in one location. For example, Bhadauria said, she would have wanted to throw a big party for her husband&#39;s 30th birthday, which happened during their time on the road.\n &#34;Things like that you miss, when you want a big gathering or a sense of community,&#34; Bhadauria said.\n Although she and Vasan love life on the road and plan to continue it for the foreseeable future, they understand the lifestyle is not sustainable indefinitely.\n &#34;With everything you get to a point where things start feeling boring or there&#39;s a burn out at some point,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;If we get to that stage, we&#39;ll be happy to go back to a home base somewhere.&#34;\n Despite the challenges of life on the road, those who spoke with CNBC said they plan to continue their nomadic lifestyle until their companies stop allowing remote work or until they get burnt out. Horn said she originally planned to live on the road for at least a year, but that&#39;s now changed.\n &#34;At six months, I still feel like I&#39;m just learning this, just getting the hang of it and just getting started,&#34;

", "note_en": "The British have suffered for their fashion for centuries according to a new study suggesting that a vogue for shoes with a pointed tip led to a sharp increase in hallux valgus of the big toe - often called bunions - in the late medieval period.\n    Researchers investigating remains in Cambridge, UK, found that those buried in the town centre, particularly in plots for wealthier citizens and clergy, were much more likely to have had bunions - suggesting rich urbanites paid a higher price for their footwear in more ways than one.   A University of Cambridge team also discovered that older medieval people with hallux valgus were significantly more likely to have sustained a broken bone from a probable fall compared to those of a similar age with normal feet.\n  Hallux valgus is a minor deformity in which the largest toe becomes angled outward and a bony protrusion forms at its base, on the inside of the foot.\n     While various factors can predispose someone to bunions, from genetics to muscle imbalance, by far the most common contemporary cause is constrictive boots and shoes. The condition is often associated with wearing high heels.\n  Archaeologists analysed 177 skeletons from cemeteries in and around the city of Cambridge and found that only 6% of individuals buried between 11th and 13th centuries had evidence of the affliction. However, 27% of those dating from the 14th and 15th centuries had been hobbled by longstanding hallux valgus.\n  Researchers point out that shoe style changed significantly during the 14th century: shifting from a functional rounded toe box to a lengthy and more elegant pointed tip.\n   In a paper published today in the\u00a0   International Journal of Paleopathology, the team from Cambridge University&#39;s After the Plague project argues that these &#34;poulaine&#34; shoes drove the rise of bunions in medieval Britain.\n  &#34;The 14th century brought an abundance of new styles of dress and footwear in a wide range of fabrics and colours. Among these fashion trends were pointed long-toed shoes called poulaines,&#34; said study co-author Dr Piers Mitchell from Cambridge&#39;s Department of Archaeology.\n  &#34;The remains of shoes excavated in places like London and Cambridge suggest that by the late 14th century almost every type of shoe was at least slightly pointed - a style common among both adults and children alike.&#34;\n     &#34;We investigated the changes that occurred between the high and late medieval periods, and realized that the increase in hallux valgus over time must have been due to the introduction of these new footwear styles,&#34; said Mitchell.\n  First author Dr Jenna Dittmar, who conducted the work while at Cambridge, said: &#34;We think of bunions as being a modern problem but this work shows it was actually one of the more common conditions to have affected medieval adults.&#34;\n  The remains came from four separate sites around Cambridge: a charitable hospital (now part of St John&#39;s College); the grounds of a former Augustinian friary, where clergy and wealthy benefactors were buried; a local parish graveyard on what was the edge of town; and a rural burial site by a village 6km south of Cambridge.\n    Researchers conducted &#34;paleopathological assessments&#34;, including inspecting foot bones for the bump by the big toe that is the hallmark of hallux valgus.   They found a sliding scale of bunion prevalence linked to the wealth of those interred on each site. Only 3% of the rural cemetery showed signs, 10% of the parish graveyard (which mainly held the working poor), creeping up to 23% of those on the hospital site.\n  Yet almost half those buried in the friary - some 43% - including five of the eleven individuals identified as clergy by their belt buckles, carried the mark of the bunion.\n     &#34;Rules for the attire of Augustinian friars included footwear that was &#39;black and fastened by a thong at the ankle&#39;, commensurate with a lifestyle of worship and poverty,&#34; said Mitchell.\n  &#34;However, in the 13th and 14th centuries it was increasingly common for those in clerical orders in Britain to wear stylish clothes - a cause for concern among high-ranking church officials.&#34;\n  In 1215, the church forbade clergy from wearing pointed-toed shoes. This may have done little to curb the trend, as numerous further decrees on indiscretions in clerical dress had to be passed, most notably in 1281 and 1342.\n    &#34;The adoption of fashionable garments by the clergy was so common it spurred criticism in contemporary literature, as seen in Chaucer&#39;s depiction of the monk in the Canterbury Tales,&#34; said Mitchell.   Across late medieval society the pointiness of shoes became so extreme that in 1463 King Edward IV passed a law limiting toe-point length to less than two inches within London.   The majority of remains with signs of hallux valgus across all sites and eras within the study were men (20 of the 31 total bunion sufferers). The research also suggests that health costs of foot fashion were not limited to bunions.\n     Dr Jenna Dittmar found that skeletal remains with hallux valgus were also more likely to show signs of fractures that usually result from a fall e.g. those to upper limbs indicating an individual tumbled forward onto outstretched arms.\n  This association was only found to be significant among those who died over 45 year old, suggesting youthful fashion choices came back to haunt the middle-aged even in medieval times.\n  &#34;Modern clinical research on patients with hallux valgus has shown that the deformity makes it harder to balance, and increases the risk of falls in older people,&#34; said Dittmar. &#34;This would explain the higher number of healed broken bones we found in medieval skeletons with this condition.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:14:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65f6\u5c1a,pointy,\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa", "title": "\u5c16\u978b\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u670b\u514b\u7684\u6591\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Fashion for pointy shoes unleashed plague of bunions in medieval Britain", "transed": 1, "url": "https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/fashion-for-pointy-shoes-unleashed.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u5c1a", "pointy", "\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "34c6c0d84b62f8ecd2ac7c588b1e9775.jpg", "infoid": 1067095, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nChua\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5979\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u5979\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u5979\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002 \u201c\u5728\u5361\u74e6\u4e07\u5d29\u6e83\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u6211\u7136\u540e\u7ad9\u5728\u522b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u201d\n \u57282021\u5e74\u6625\u5929\uff0c\u695a\u90a3\u65f6\u51e0\u5468\u51fa\u7248\u4e86\u5979\u5173\u4e8e\u665a\u5bb4 - \u95e8\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u9898\u4e3a\u201c\u6d3b\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u201d\u7684PDF\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u8036\u9c81\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5468\u56f4\u6d41\u4f20\u3002\u8be5\u6587\u4ef6\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba3\u8a93\u4e66\u7684\u98ce\u683c;\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u9ed1\u8272\u51fa\u6c34\u6bb5\u548c\u9644\u5f55\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u77ed\u4fe1\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u8036\u9c81\u5f8b\u5e08\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u8c01\u662f\u4e0e\u695a\u90a3\u7684\u4e24\u4f4d\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fdc\u65b9\u7684\u89c2\u770b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6559\u6388\u4f3c\u4e4e\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\uff1a\n John Doe\u53d1\u77ed\u4fe1\u7ed9\u6211\uff08\u6587\u4ef61\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chua\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4f1a\u5728\u7b2c\u4e5d\u6761\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u6cd5\u5b98\u505a\u597d\u804c\u5458\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u5979\u201c\u4e3a\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u51e0\u4f4d\u6cd5\u5b98\u201d\u3002\n  \u6211\u8fce\u6765\u4e86\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u6bcd\u9e7f\u53bb\u6d17\u8863\u670d\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\uff0c\u6211\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3aJane Doe\uff0c\u4ed6\u5411\u4ed6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chua\u521a\u521a\u9080\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u665a\u9910\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6234\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4ec0\u4e48\uff08\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u5b9a\u5e26\u4e00\u74f6\u8461\u8404\u9152\uff09\u3002 \u3002 \u3002 \u3002\n \u540e\u6765\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f20\u8a00\u79f0\uff0c\u201cChua\u4e00\u76f4\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u665a\u5bb4\u201d\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u7b14\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4e24\u4f4d\u670b\u53cb\u90fd\u53bb\u8fc7\u4ed6\u4eec\uff0c\u62a5\u9053\u4e86Chua\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5211\u4e8b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u201c\u6863\u6848\u201d\u662f\u6781\u70b9\n...... ", "note_en": "A decade ago, back when we talked about things besides new coronavirus strains and vaccination rates, there was a weeks-long media frenzy over a parenting memoir called \u201c Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother .\u201d In  that book, Amy Chua, an American daughter of Chinese immigrants, described her efforts to raise her children the \u201cChinese\u201d way. For her, that meant dispensing with squishy Western conventions like \u201cchild-led learning\u201d and participation trophies, and ruthlessly driving her two young daughters to master their classical instruments and maintain perfect grades. The book provoked a fierce backlash, much of which centered on Chua\u2019s tactics, which ranged from threatening to burn her older daughter\u2019s stuffed animals to rejecting a hand-scrawled birthday card that demonstrated insufficient effort. Chua\u2019s younger daughter \u201crebelled\u201d at the age of thirteen, choosing competitive tennis over concert-level violin, but, for the most part, Chua\u2019s system worked. Her daughters became musical prodigies and successful athletes, who attended Harvard and Yale. The phrase \u201ctiger mom\u201d entered the cultural lexicon and spawned a Singaporean TV show, \u201cTiger Mum,\u201d and a show in Hong Kong, \u201cTiger Mom Blues.\u201d\n That was the last time many of us heard about Amy Chua\u2014unless you\u2019ve been following the news out of Yale Law School, where Chua is a professor. If so, you know that the  discussion  kept going. Over the past few months, Chua has been at the center of a campus-wide fracas that, nominally, concerns the question of whether she hosted drunken dinner parties at her home this past winter. The controversy began in April, when the  Yale Daily News  reported that the law-school administration was punishing Chua for the alleged offense by removing her from the list of professors leading a special first-year law class called a \u201csmall group.\u201d\n Normally, drinking with students wouldn\u2019t be out of bounds. Yale Law is known for being a cozy place, as far as law schools go, and students are typically in their mid-twenties\u2014well past the legal drinking age. But, last winter, when Chua\u2019s parties supposedly took place, there was a pandemic going on. And Chua\u2019s husband, her fellow Yale Law professor Jed Rubenfeld, was serving a two-year  suspension from the faculty for sexual harassment. And, as the  Yale Daily News article revealed, Chua technically wasn\u2019t supposed to be having students over to her home or serving them alcohol. Three years ago, when the law school investigated Rubenfeld for harassment, the investigator also looked into allegations that Chua had engaged in \u201cexcessive drinking\u201d with students and had said offensive things to them. Chua denies that this is exactly what happened. But, at any rate, in 2019, she was issued a financial penalty, and she wrote a letter to the law school\u2019s administration agreeing \u201cnot to invite students to my home or out to drinks for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n Everyone on campus knew about Rubenfeld\u2019s situation, but Chua\u2019s had not been made public\u2014only the dean\u2019s office and the student complainants knew about it. Chua was outraged that the student newspaper had divulged a private disciplinary matter. She told me that her Gen Z daughter Lulu, the former violin prodigy, encouraged her to come out swinging. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, \u2018You have to fight the narrative,\u2019 so I just did something shocking,\u201d Chua said. She wrote an open letter saying that she\u2019d been falsely accused and described a Zoom call with the Yale Law dean in which she\u2019d been treated \u201cdegradingly, like a criminal.\u201d She also claimed that she had been barred from teaching a small-group class without receiving an explanation from the dean\u2019s office. \u201cI sent it to my entire faculty, and I tweeted it,\u201d Chua said. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s been kind of an escalating nightmare.\u201d  Slate,  Fox News, and the   Post picked up the story. Earlier this month, the   Times published an investigation into what has become known as \u201cDinner Party-gate.\u201d\n The question has arisen, in online comments sections and on Twitter, why anyone is even talking about Amy Chua. Who cares about a parenting memoirist\u2019s removal from a law-school teaching roster? The answer is, in part, because this story manages to touch on seemingly every single cultural flashpoint of the past few years. Chua\u2019s critics see a story about #MeToo\u2014because of her husband, but also because Chua supported the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, even after he was accused of sexual assault. Meanwhile, Chua\u2019s defenders see a morality tale about liberal cancel culture. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to you is SOP\u201d\u2014standard operating procedure\u2014\u201cfor conservative allies but chills me to the bone nonetheless,\u201d a supporter tweeted at her, earlier this month.  Megyn Kelly weighed in, tweeting, \u201cMake no mistake: this is retribution for her support of Brett Kavanaugh, &amp; it is disgusting.\u201d Chua\u2019s allies have also suggested that anti-Asian bias is involved. \u201cThe woke academy reserves a special vitriol for minority faculty who don\u2019t toe the line politically,\u201d Niall Ferguson, a historian,  tweeted.\n Chua and her husband aren\u2019t politically conservative\u2014she says that Rubenfeld has historically been \u201cvery left-leaning,\u201d whereas she is a \u201csolid independent\u201d\u2014but they are provocateurs. Both husband and wife have a knack for finding subjects that get people talking, or, rather, screaming at one another around the dinner table. In a 2013 legal article, Rubenfeld pontificated on how we define rape. (See: \u201c The Riddle of Rape-by-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy,\u201d Part V, Section 3: \u201cNo Means No \u2013 but It May Not Mean Rape.\u201d) Chua often writes about ethnicity. In 2014, the couple co-wrote a book, called \u201c The Triple Package,\u201d about why some cultural groups are more successful in America than others, inspired by the authors\u2019 own Chinese and Jewish heritage. In a New York  Times review of Chua\u2019s latest book, \u201c Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations,\u201d published in 2018, David Frum described the professor as \u201can uncomfortable presence in American intellectual life.\u201d He went on, \u201cChua approaches the no-go areas around which others usually tiptoe. The warning alarms burst into \u2018WAH-OH, WAH-OH\u2019\u2014and Chua greets the custodians with a mild, \u2019Oh sorry, was that a taboo?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n On the Yale Law campus, in New Haven, the Chua-Rubenfelds are local celebrities. Until recently, their home was something of a salon: a place where you could meet a federal judge, a published author, or a television producer. \u201cNew Haven craves a little bit of glamour,\u201d an alum from the late nineties told me. \u201cAmy was friends with Wendi Murdoch. She\u2019d go to Davos. They have a super-nice apartment in New York, and they\u2019d throw parties there.\u201d Once Chua became known as the Tiger Mom, she even began dressing accordingly. A current Yale Law student told me that, this past semester, the professor wore a tiger-print mask in every class.\n  One must understand the social dynamics at Yale Law to truly grasp the significance of Dinner Party-gate. The top-ranked law school in the country, Yale is known for being the spot where Bill and Hillary Clinton met, as well as the alma mater of four current Supreme Court Justices. It\u2019s supposed to be more philosophical and progressive than its counterpart at Harvard, which has more than twice as many students, many of whom tend to go on to more boring, lucrative careers in corporate law. This makes for an intense social environment at Yale. \u201cThe law school is quite small, but it\u2019s quite riven,\u201d a woman who graduated earlier this year told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a very vocal minority of social-justice-oriented students,\u201d who are there to pursue their passions for criminal-justice reform or women\u2019s rights. There are also plenty of hyper-diligent strivers, sometimes referred to as \u201cgunners.\u201d Frequently, these groups overlap.\n Every gunner shares the same dream: to kick off their careers with a clerkship for a big-name judge\u2014ideally one of the \u201cfeeder judges\u201d (usually those serving on the Court of Appeals), whose clerks often end up clerking on the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court clerkship is the ultimate gold star. \u201cIf you get that, it\u2019s like the key that unlocks all the other doors in the legal profession,\u201d a Yale Law graduate from 2019 told me. \u201cIf you want to be in the Solicitor General\u2019s office, a Supreme Court clerkship will open that door. Same goes for a top law firm with a huge signing bonus.\u201d (According to lore, the Supreme Court-clerk sweetener clocks in at four hundred thousand dollars.)\n The best clerkships go to the very best law students. But the first semester at Yale is pass-fail\u2014after that, the marks range from \u201chonors\u201d to \u201cfailure\u201d\u2014so it can be hard to distinguish one brilliant applicant from the next. In this context, a professor\u2019s recommendation counts for a lot. A recommendation from Amy Chua, even more so. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of seen as a golden ticket to clerkships,\u201d the woman who graduated earlier this year told me. She explained that when she began the process of applying for clerkships, she reached out to other students for advice. \u201cEvery person I called to ask \u2018How did you get this job?\u2019 told me, \u2018Amy Chua made a phone call.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Chua\u2019s path to becoming a kingmaker has been unorthodox. Rubenfeld, a constitutional-law expert, was hired by Yale in 1990. According to Chua, she bungled her initial interview, instead landing at Duke\u2019s law school, and didn\u2019t join her husband until the spring of 2001, when Yale brought her on as a visiting professor. Later that semester, she was offered a tenured position. \u201cMy perception when I came to Yale Law School was that my husband was a superstar, and all these people were so articulate, and I was the only Asian-American woman on the academic faculty,\u201d Chua recalled. \u201cI could barely speak at faculty meetings, and I was always so on the outs\u2014just a kind of marginal figure.\u201d It took a few years for the tide to shift. By the early twenty-tens, though, \u201cAmy was the most popular teacher at the school, with the possible exception of Heather Gerken,\u201d a professor told me.\n  At Yale, Gerken and Chua represent two different kinds of figures. Gerken is one of the nation\u2019s leading specialists in election law and constitutional law, and served as a senior adviser to Barack Obama during both of his Presidential campaigns. (In 2017, she was named the dean of Yale Law, becoming the first woman ever to hold that position.) Chua, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have much standing as a legal scholar. While many of her colleagues\u2014Rubenfeld included\u2014built up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with law-review articles, Chua threw herself into teaching and mentorship with the same vigor that she once applied to parenting.\n As a mentor, Chua is known to have a type: immigrants or students of color, usually those who have come from impoverished backgrounds. But she also takes an interest in conservative students\u2014an arguably marginalized group at Yale\u2014and those pursuing nontraditional careers, like business or journalism. (One of her most notable mentees was  J. D. Vance, the author of the 2016 best-seller \u201c Hillbilly Elegy,\u201d who ticked several of those boxes.) \u201cI think she likes people who are a little bit of an outsider or underdog for whatever reason,\u201d the 2019 graduate told me. One group of mentees even began calling themselves \u201cChuaPets.\u201d \u201cA lot of people adore Amy Chua,\u201d the woman who graduated earlier this year said. \u201cThey take a class with her, and she takes a shine to them, and then their lives get better. And it\u2019s not just the gunners. She\u2019s also supposed to be very caring and supportive even with weirdos who can\u2019t get clerkships.\u201d\n In the wake of Dinner Party-gate, Chua posted sixty-seven pages of e-mails, from student mentees past and present, on her personal Web site. The stories have a similar arc. The mentees describe their backgrounds: one came from a tiny fishing village in China that did not have indoor plumbing; another writes, \u201cI grew up a poor Black bastard raised by a single-mother of two.\u201d I spoke to one of the letter writers, a recent graduate, who is also a first-generation immigrant. The graduate had found many faculty mentors, but those relationships were \u201cmore or less purely academic,\u201d she said. Chua was different. \u201cShe was interested in knowing who I am, where I came from, about my family back home.\u201d Chua gave her detailed feedback on her papers and insidery advice on how to apply for clerkships. For example, she advised the student to keep quiet about her passion for international law, warning that it might make her a less attractive candidate. \u201cNo other professor had told me that,\u201d the graduate said. \u201cIt was something I wouldn\u2019t have known unless I had a dad or a mom who was a lawyer in this country.\u201d On graduation day, she recalled, \u201cI was reflecting on what I would have done differently if I had another chance at the law school. Basically, I wish I\u2019d gotten to know Professor Chua earlier. That\u2019s my biggest regret.\u201d\n In 2017, the legal world, like everyone else, started to feel the effects of the #MeToo movement. The first domino to fall was Alex Kozinski, a prominent conservative judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who, in late 2017, resigned after multiple women, including clerks, accused him of sexual misconduct. Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, was probably one of the most influential judges in America, apart from the nine Supreme Court Justices.\n In 2018, Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, a former Kozinski clerk, to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh had attended Yale Law and was known for hiring clerks from the school. Chua, whose oldest daughter, Sophia\u2014also a Yale Law alum\u2014had been chosen to clerk for Kavanaugh, endorsed him in an op-ed titled \u201c Kavanaugh Is a Mentor to Women.\u201d Later that month,  Christine Blasey Ford accused the nominee of sexual assault. Chua didn\u2019t withdraw her endorsement. Then, days before Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing,  the  Guardian reported that Chua had made suggestive comments to students in her small-group class about Kavanaugh\u2019s preferences regarding the appearance of his female law clerks.\n  In some ways, this wasn\u2019t surprising. Chua often describes herself as \u201cunfiltered.\u201d A lawyer who has interacted with her told me that it\u2019s more than that: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like she has verbal Tourette\u2019s.\u201d I spoke with one alum who took a small-group class that Chua was teaching in the fall of 2017. At first, she loved Chua\u2019s candor. \u201cShe was, like, \u2018I\u2019m going to be straightforward and give you the real deal about clerkships and jobs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the alum recalled. But, sometimes, things got weird. There was a lot of drinking, and Chua would share details about professors\u2019 personal lives or the internal politics of who was getting tenure. During one gathering, at Chua\u2019s home, Chua \u201cbrought up some weird sexual kinks of a friend she used to spend time with in her twenties,\u201d the alum said. \u201cIt was a non sequitur.\u201d The alum wasn\u2019t offended; it was just too much information. \u201cIt read to me like social anxiety,\u201d she said. \u201cShe seemed kind of desperate to impress people and be liked.\u201d (Chua wrote to me, in response to that story, that \u201cI have a lot of regrets, and that I know it\u2019s one of my faults to be unfiltered or over-the-top or too spontaneous\u2014sometimes saying something stupid just to fill up an awkward silence. I\u2019ve really tried to change\u2014in fact, I think definitely  have changed.\u201d)\n  Another student from that small-group class recently wrote a kind of open letter to Chua, in which she told her version of the Kavanaugh story. She claims that Chua was hanging out with a group of female students at a bar, when she started talking about the #MeToo movement and the federal judiciary. \u201cYou went on to mention that a judge named Kavanaugh\u201d\u2014then a Circuit Court judge\u2014\u201chad a predilection for good-looking clerks.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You said, however, that you weren\u2019t concerned for your daughter, his future clerk, because she would never put up with that sort of behavior.\u201d The student adds that Chua later said that Kozinski\u2019s harassment \u201cwas an open secret,\u201d but that she did her best to combat it \u201cby steering female candidates in another direction.\u201d (Chua claims that her statements have been distorted.)\n At the time of the Kavanaugh debate, Chua was off campus, undergoing surgery for a medical issue. When she returned, in 2019, both she and her husband were under a cloud. At the time, Rubenfeld was dealing with his own sexual-misconduct scandal; in the spring of 2018, following complaints of Rubenfeld\u2019s attempting to kiss or touch students and making suggestive comments to them\u2014for example, joking about \u201ctickling\u201d female students, and asking about their sex lives\u2014Dean Gerken hired an outside investigator to look into his behavior. Rubenfeld denied sexually harassing anyone, but, in 2020, he was suspended for two years without pay, which is among the most severe punishments that a tenured professor can receive. Some student activists were not satisfied. A campus group called Yale Law Women released a  statement demanding that he be permanently removed from campus. \u201cWe do not want Jed Rubenfeld to prey on a new generation of students,\u201d they wrote.\n Chua\u2019s connection to the matter was ambiguous. She hadn\u2019t been accused of harassment herself. But some of Rubenfeld\u2019s critics saw her as an enabler of her husband. \u201cShe kind of provides muscle for him, because of her clerkship connections,\u201d one Yale alum said. \u201c \u2019Cause it\u2019s like, you\u2019re one of Jed\u2019s acolytes? If you put up with his shit, she\u2019ll help you get a clerkship.\u201d Her relationships with judges could also make her seem scary.  Slate reported that, after a student publicly condemned a  Times Op-Ed that Rubenfeld wrote about campus rape, Chua threatened to \u201ccall every justice on the Supreme Court\u201d to tell them not to hire the student. Chua has denied making such threats. She told me, \u201cMany people have suggested that the way I\u2019m being depicted\u2014as this ruthless, cunning, intimidating, manipulative, domineering person\u2014that\u2019s exactly the stereotype of the dragon lady.\u201d\n But the perception stuck. A man who recently graduated from Yale Law recounted a conversation that he\u2019d had with two female friends while selecting his courses for the spring 2020 semester. \u201cI mentioned I was thinking about taking International Business Transactions\u201d\u2014Chua\u2019s class\u2014\u201cand it was like I\u2019d said, \u2018I\u2019m signing up for Holocaust studies with Hitler,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThe mood changed immediately. They started talking about her husband, and Brett Kavanaugh, and rape culture.\u201d He decided to take the course anyway, although he eventually stopped mentioning it to people.\n Chua told me that even though her classes remained popular, she could feel the shift in her reputation. \u201cEverything changed after the Kavanaugh debacle,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I then stood for something else.\u201d\n In the spring of 2021, a few weeks after Chua published her open letter about Dinner Party-gate, a PDF titled \u201cTimeline of Events\u201d began circulating around Yale Law. The document was written loosely in the style of a legal affidavit; it includes blacked-out passages and an appendix with screenshots of text messages. Its author, a Yale Law student who is friends with two of Chua\u2019s mentees, describes watching from afar as the professor appears to advance friends\u2019 careers:\n John Doe texts me (  Document 1) explaining that Chua thinks hewould make a good clerk to a competitive judge on the Ninth Circuitand that she \u201chas picked several judges\u201d for him.\n  I go over to John Doe\u2019s to do my laundry. While at his apartment, Ihear him call Jane Doe, who explains to him that Chua has just invitedthem over for dinner tomorrow. They discuss what to wear and what theyshould bring (ultimately deciding to bring a bottle of wine).\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\n Later on, the author hears a rumor that \u201cChua has been hosting dinner parties with judges.\u201d Concluding that both friends have been going to them, the author reported Chua.

easy to take flying for granted. We hop on-board a comfy airliner and fly high in the stratosphere without giving  breathing a second thought. The aircraft\u2019s pressurization system makes it possible. Here\u2019s how the magic works\u2026\n    Hypothetical experiment: If you place a scale in a vacuum chamber and compare the weight of a filled balloon with an empty one, you\u2019ll see that air has mass.\n Earth\u2019s atmosphere is about 300 miles thick. At sea level, our bodies are subjected to about 14.7 pounds of pressure from this tall column of air. I\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t even notice!\u00a0For animals roaming the earth\u2019s surface, a 14.7 psi atmosphere provides the perfect amount of oxygen.\n As we climb in altitude, the amount of air pressure acting on\u00a0us decreases rapidly. You notice the decrease when your ears pop while driving up a mountain or riding\u00a0a fast elevator. Although the atmosphere is 300 miles thick, most of the air molecules are squashed down to within a few thousand feet of the earth\u2019s surface.\n  As we climb higher, air molecules are spread farther apart. When we breathe, our lungs take in less air, and less oxygen. Folks living in Denver, Colorado (5600 ft) are quite happy breathing the lower, 12 psi atmosphere. Climbing to a higher altitude, though, and the pressure drops really fast.\n At 18,000 feet, the atmospheric pressure is down to 7.3 psi, about  half the sea-level pressure. There just isn\u2019t enough oxygen in a breath of air to adequately supply the brain. At this pressure, a healthy adult has only 20-30 minutes of useful consciousness.\n Airliners fly between 30,000 and 43,000 feet. At those altitudes the atmosphere provides less than 4 psi of pressure. If you tried breathing at that altitude, your useful consciousness would be less than a minute (followed soon after by death).\n To survive high altitudes, occupants of an aircraft need help breathing. The solution is to pump air into the airplane so the interior pressure is high enough to keep the humans happy.\n  Airplanes can certainly fly below 10,000 feet where the atmospheric pressure is a comfy 10 psi or higher, but it has some drawbacks:\n  If you want a fast, smooth ride in a fuel efficient airplane that can fly over a mountain range, we need to pressurize!\n  The airplane body (fuselage) is a long tube capable of withstanding a fair amount of differential\u00a0air pressure; think of it like a big plastic soda bottle. In theory, we could seal the bottle so, as the airplane climbs, the interior air pressure would stay the same. We can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s hard to perfectly seal a huge airplane fuselage. Even if we could, the passengers would quickly use up\u00a0the available oxygen. And just imagine the smell inside a perfectly sealed tube on a long flight! Clearly, a big sealed soda bottle won\u2019t work for us without some modification.\n  To solve the problems, pressurization systems constantly pump fresh, outside air into the fuselage. To control the interior pressure, and allow old, stinky air to exit, there is a motorized door called an  outflow valve\u00a0located near the tail of the aircraft. It\u2019s about the size of a briefcase and located on the side or bottom of the fuselage. Larger aircraft often have two outflow valves. The valves are\u00a0automatically controlled by the aircraft\u2019s pressurization system. If higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the door closes. To reduce cabin pressure, the door slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. It\u2019s one of the simplest systems on an aircraft.\n  One of the benefits of a pressurization system is the constant flow of clean, fresh air moving through the aircraft. The air inside the airplane is completely changed every two or three minutes making it far cleaner than the air in your home or office.\n Pressurization systems are designed to keep the interior cabin pressure between 12 and 11 psi at cruise altitude. On a typical flight, as the aircraft climbs to 36,000 feet, the interior of the plane \u201cclimbs\u201d to between 6000-8000 feet.\n  Why not keep the cabin at 14.7 psi to simulate sea-level pressure and maximize comfort? The aircraft must be designed to withstand  differential pressure, that\u2019s the difference between the air pressure inside and outside the aircraft. Exceeding the differential pressure limit is what makes a balloon pop when it\u2019s over inflated. The greater the differential pressure, the stronger (and heavier) the airplane must be built. It\u2019s possible to build an aircraft that can withstand sea-level pressure during cruise, but it would require a significant increase in strength and weight. A 12 psi cabin is a good trade-off.\n If you look at pictures of airliners taken prior to 1990, you might see brown stains around the outflow valve. The stains are from  tobacco smoke. Airlines were thrilled when the industry banned smoking. Tar and nicotine\u00a0gummed up valves, instruments, and sensors causing thousands of dollars a year in damage. Tobacco is  really nasty stuff.\n  Two types of mechanical devices are installed on the fuselage to protect the pressurized section of the aircraft against excessive pressure differential.\n  Every pressurized aircraft has a maximum pressure differential limit. Exceeding this limit (pumping too much air pressure into the fuselage) can cause damage \u2013 even blow out doors and windows. To protect the aircraft from over pressurizing,  positive pressure relief valves are installed. The devices (sometimes called butterfly valves) are spring-loaded to vent excess air pressure when cabin pressure exceeds the maximum limit.\n   Negative pressure differential means the pressure outside the cabin is greater than the pressure inside the cabin. This situation could occur during a rapid descent. Negative pressure is bad because it pushes inward on doors and windows. These components are not designed for this type of force.\n Again, spring-loaded devices are used to protect the fuselage from damage. Air pressure of less than 1.0 psi against the outside of the doors causes them to open inward against the spring load, venting air into the fuselage to equalize the pressure.\n     Electric Compressors Old piston powered airliners, like the Boeing Stratocruiser, used electric air compressors to pump fresh, outside air into the cabin. This system worked well, but the compressors added a lot of weight to the aircraft.\n    Turbocompressors Early jetliners, like the Douglas DC-8 and Boeing 707 used bleed air from the engines to spin turbocompressors. The turbocompressors then pumped fresh outside air into the cabin.\n    Engine Bleed Air Most modern airliners use bleed air from the compressor section of the engines to pressurize the cabin. This very hot air must be cooled to a comfortable temperature before it\u2019s directed into\u00a0the cabin.\n    Electric Compressors (Again!) The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner brings back the electric compressor. The 787\u2019s electrical system powers compressors, just like on the old Stratocruiser. Advances in technology make this system far more efficient than it\u2019s predecessor from the 1950\u2019s.\n A jet engine has three main sections: compressor, combustion, and turbine/exhaust. The compressor is at the front of the engine. A series of spinning blades draws in fresh, outside air. As the air is compressed, it becomes very hot. Remember high school physics? As a gas is compressed, its temperature rises. The hot, compressed air then enters the combustion\u00a0chamber where it is mixed with fuel and burned. The expanded gasses continue through turbine blades which power the compressor blades before exiting the engine producing thrust.\n   Bleed air is  fresh, clean, hot air taken from the compressor section of the engine  before\u00a0it is mixed with fuel or exhaust gasses. Common uses for hot bleed air are wing\u00a0and engine ice protection, cabin pressurization, engine starter motors, and air driven hydraulic pumps.\n    It\u2019s really,  really easy. The cabin altitude\u00a0control panel on the 757 and 767 is super simple. During preflight checks, pilots turn the \u201cLDG ALT\u201d knob to display the altitude of the landing airport. That\u2019s it! We don\u2019t touch it for the remainder\u00a0of the flight. The automatic mode takes care of the outflow valve for us.\n The remaining\u00a0indicators and knobs are for redundancy in case of a malfunction. There are two separate automatic modes. A\u00a0manual mode allows us to adjust the position of the outflow valve should both auto systems fail. Pressurization systems work great and rarely cause any trouble.\n  The air inside an aircraft cabin\u00a0is\u00a0 very low in humidity. On a long flight it\u2019s important to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. When the flight attendant offers you a bottle of water, drink it. You may not notice that you\u2019re dehydrated.\n Alcohol consumption: Dehydration increases the effects of alcohol on your body. To make matters worse, alcohol increases dehydration; it\u2019s a double-whammy.\u00a0If you choose to drink alcohol on a flight, be sure to drink plenty of water and have something to eat while enjoying your cocktail.\u00a0Don\u2019t be  that guy. Drink   extra-responsibly when flying.\n Does this food taste bland?\u00a0Yes! There\u2019s a good chance your in-flight meal really does taste bland. The aircraft cabin\u2019s low humidity and lower air pressure reduce\u00a0your sense of taste and smell by as much as 30% according to a  Lufthansa commissioned\u00a0study.

The culprit is the WindowServer process: a core part of macOS responsible for drawing on the screen.\n  This seems to be a commonly reported bug (?) that started happening in Big Sur, where the WindowServer CPU usage scales with the polling rate of the input device:    I did some tests out of curiosity, and I can confirm that the CPU spike does scale with the polling rate.\n The mouse I\u2019m using daily (the one used in the recording above) is a  Logitech Pro X Superlight, a gaming mouse with a 1000 Hz polling rate (I use a gaming mouse even if I don\u2019t play videogames because I\u2019m very sensitive to input delay). After a fresh start, with a 1000Hz polling, rate WindowServer goes from ~2% to ~50% CPU usage. Lowering the polling rate to 125Hz (the lowest polling rate I can choose) makes the WindowServer process reach ~20% CPU usage. Doing so also  makes my MacBook more silent because the fans don\u2019t start as often as when using a higher polling rate (I can\u2019t provide \u201cscientific\u201d proof, though, so please take it with a grain of salt).\n Then, I tried with two other mice: a  Logitech G203 (wired) that produced the same results, and an Amazon Basics wireless mouse (no idea what its polling rate is), which made WindowServer reach ~25% CPU usage.\n Finally, I tried and with a Magic Trackpad 2 (which should have a polling rate of ~90Hz) and with the built-in MacBook trackpad, and  there were almost no changes to the WindowServer CPU usage.\n I\u2019d love to learn why and how Big Sur introduced this issue in macOS\u2026 but I feel I\u2019ll never know the answer :)\n I did my test on two different MacBooks with Big Sure (both producing similar results):\n MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), 2,3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4 GB\n MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), 2,8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB 2133 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:12:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9f20\u6807,mouse,windowserver", "title": "\u79fb\u52a8\u9f20\u6807\u5149\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6469\u6258\u65af\u4e0a\u7684CPU\u5c16\u5cf0 ", "title_en": "Moving the mouse cursor can cause CPU spikes on macOS", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2021-06-18-macos-windowserver-cpu-spike-mouse/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9f20\u6807", "mouse"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067091, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

Meanwhile tech companies are taking a far more flexible approach.\n As for workers themselves, more than half of those surveyed in a recent Pew Research Center survey said that, given the choice, they would want to keep working from home even after the pandemic subsides.\n Here&#39;s how some of the biggest names in tech and finance are handling the return to office life.\n  Apple expects employees to return to their offices three days a week come September, CEO Tim Cook wrote in an email to employees earlier this month, according to The Verge.\n &#34;For all that we&#39;ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,&#34; Cook said in the email. &#34;Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.&#34;\n Employees are expected to be in the office Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, but those with roles that allow for remote work will have the option to work from home Wednesdays and Fridays. The company is also offering up to two weeks of remote work annually and encouraging, but not requiring, vaccination.\n  Facebook announced earlier this month that employees can apply for remote work if their role allows. Any worker who wants to return to the office may do so on a flexible basis but is encouraged to spend at least half of their time in the office. Employees will also be granted 20 days each year to work from a remote location.\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees in a memo that he plans to continue working remotely for at least half of the next year, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business.\n  Until September, Google workers around the world can continue to work remotely before deciding between coming back to their office, working out of a different Google office or applying for full-time remote work.\n &#34;The future of work is flexibility,&#34; CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a May memo to employees.\n Pichai said he expects about 60% of employees to return to their pre-pandemic offices while 20% move to a different office and 20% work from home.\n  Twitter has yet to set an exact start date for welcoming employees back to the office, but it plans to start with a 20% capacity limit.\n Early in the pandemic, the company said it plans to let some of its workforce continue working remotely &#34;forever&#34; if they choose.\n &#34;If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,&#34; said Twitter&#39;s vice president of people, Jennifer Christie, in a statement to CNN Business. &#34;If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it&#39;s safe to return.&#34;\n The company has stressed that it wants employees to have the choice to return to the office, but it anticipates that most workers will opt for a hybrid model, spending some time in the office and some time at home.\n  Uber will shift to a hybrid model in September, according to an April blog post from Nikki Krishnamurthy, the company&#39;s chief people officer.\n Employees at the ride-hailing company are expected in the office three days a week, but they will have the option to work remotely the other two days.\n &#34;We feel that this combination of in-person and remote work will give people the freedom to do their best work while staying connected to their colleagues,&#34; Krishnamurthy said in the blog post.\n  Bank of America is encouraging, and expecting, all vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day, CEO Brian Moynihan said this week.\n &#34;Our view is all the vaccinated teammates will be back,&#34; Moynihan said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week. &#34;We&#39;ll be able to operate fairly normally and will then start to make provisions for the other teammates as we move through the fall.&#34;\n The bank is not mandating employees to report their vaccination status, but it is expecting them to input their status in the company portal.\n  Citi said in March that it recognized how people have benefited from aspects of working remotely, and that it would embrace some flexibility in the return-to-office process.\n The bank said it expects up to 30% of US staff to return to the office in July. The majority of Citi workers globally will be designated as &#34;hybrid,&#34; working in the office at least three days a week and from home up to two days per week.\n  Goldman Sachs welcomed employees back to the office on Monday. The company is expecting 5,400 newly hired interns, analysts and associates in the office in addition to its returning employees.\n &#34;We are focused on progressing on our journey to gradually bring our people back together again, where it is safe to do so, and are now in a position to activate the next steps in our return to office strategy,&#34; the bank&#39;s leadership wrote in a May staff memo.\n Leading up to the return to in-person work, Goldman Sachs also mandated that its employees report their vaccination status. While vaccination is not required, the company is encouraging all staff to get vaccinated if possible.\n  Last month, JPMorgan opened all of its US offices to employees with a 50% occupancy cap. Executives at the bank informed staff that it expects all US-based employees back in the office by early July on a consistent rotational schedule, subject to the same 50% cap.\n &#34;We firmly believe that working together in person is important for our culture, clients, businesses and teams,&#34; JPMorgan executives said.\n  Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman took a hard line earlier this week, saying he expects the bank&#39;s New York employees back in the office by Labor Day.\n &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said at an investing conference.\n The company has not mandated vaccination, but Gorman noted that &#34;well over 90%&#34; of employees had already received their Covid-19 vaccination. That number is expected to hit 98% to 99%, according to Gorman.\n The bank will continue to consider returning to the office on a case-by-case basis, Gorman said, recognizing that some employees may not be able to be vaccinated, or may be in a different situation if their office is outside of New York.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:11:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u4eba,rushing,\u5458\u5de5", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5de5\u4eba\u8d76\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4 ", "title_en": "The companies rushing workers back to the office", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_63f084b70df88bccd604e9b93404fcf9", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u4eba", "rushing", "\u5458\u5de5"]}]
