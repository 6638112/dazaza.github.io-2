Others had been shot on their doorsteps with their hands bound with belts. Among the dead were priests, old men, women, entire families and a group of more than 20 Sunday school children, some as young as 14, according to eyewitnesses, parents and their teacher.</p><p>      这些尸体，有些穿着白色教堂长袍，鲜血淋漓，散落在干旱的田野，矮小的农田和干燥的河床中。其他人的双手被绑在皮带上，被枪杀在他们的家门口。目击者，父母及其老师说，死者中有牧师，老人，妇女，整个家庭以及一群20多名主日学童，其中一些年仅14岁。</p><p> Abraham recognized some of the children immediately. They were from his town in Ethiopia&#39;s northern Tigray region, Edaga Hamus, and had also fled fighting there two weeks earlier. As clashes raged, Abraham and his family, along with hundreds of other displaced people, escaped to Dengelat, a nearby village in a craggy valley ringed by steep, rust-colored cliffs. They sought shelter at Maryam Dengelat, a historic monastery complex famed for a centuries-old, rock-hewn church.</p><p> 亚伯拉罕立即认出了其中一些孩子。他们来自埃塞俄比亚北部提格雷地区埃达加·哈穆斯（Edaga Hamus）的小镇，两周前也逃到那里。冲突激化后，亚伯拉罕和他的家人以及其他数百名流离失所者逃到了登格莱特（Dengelat），该村庄位于崎steep不平的山谷中，周围是陡峭，锈色的悬崖环绕。他们在Maryam Dengelat寻求庇护，Maryam Dengelat是一座历史悠久的修道院建筑群，以一座拥有百年历史的凿岩教堂而闻名。</p><p>     On November 30, they were joined by scores of religious pilgrims for the Orthodox festival of Tsion Maryam, an annual feast to mark the day Ethiopians believe the Ark of the Covenant was brought to the country from Jerusalem. The holy day was a welcome respite from weeks of violence, but it would not last.</p><p>     11月30日，数十名宗教朝圣者参加了Tsion Maryam东正教节日，这是一年一度的盛宴，以纪念埃塞俄比亚人相信约柜是从耶路撒冷被带到该国的日子。在数周的暴力冲突中，圣洁的日子是令人欣慰的，但它不会持续。</p><p>  A group of Eritrean soldiers opened fire on Maryam Dengelat church while hundreds of congregants were celebrating mass, eyewitnesses say. People tried to flee on foot, scrambling up cliff paths to neighboring villages. The troops followed, spraying the mountainside with bullets.</p><p>  目击者说，一群厄立特里亚士兵向Maryam Dengelat教堂开火，而数百名全民则在庆祝弥撒。人们试图步行逃离，爬上通往邻近村庄的悬崖小路。部队跟在后面，向山腰喷上子弹。</p><p> A CNN investigation drawing on interviews with 12 eyewitnesses, more than 20 relatives of the survivors and photographic evidence sheds light on what happened next.</p><p> CNN的调查取材于12位目击者，20多名幸存者的亲属的采访以及摄影证据，为接下来发生的事情提供了启示。</p><p> The soldiers went door to door, dragging people from their homes. Mothers were forced to tie up their sons. A pregnant woman was shot, her husband killed. Some of the survivors hid under the bodies of the dead.</p><p> 士兵们挨家挨户，将人们拖离家园。母亲被迫捆绑儿子。一名孕妇被枪杀，丈夫被杀。一些幸存者躲在死者的尸体下。 </p><p> The mayhem continued for three days, with soldiers slaughtering local residents, displaced people and pilgrims. Finally, on December 2, the soldiers allowed informal burials to take place, but threatened to kill anyone they saw mourning. Abraham volunteered.</p><p>这场混乱持续了三天，士兵们屠杀了当地居民，流离失所者和朝圣者。最终，在12月2日，士兵们允许进行非正式的葬礼，但威胁要杀害所有他们哀悼的人。亚伯拉罕自愿参加。</p><p> Footage obtained by CNN shows the shoes of some of those killed in Dengelat.  Credit: Obtained by CNN</p><p> 美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）获得的录像显示了在登格拉特（Dengelat）遇难者的鞋子。信用：由CNN获得</p><p>  Under their watchful eyes, he held back tears as he sorted through the bodies of children and teenagers, collecting identity cards from pockets and making meticulous notes about their clothing or hairstyle. Some were completely unrecognizable, having been shot in the face, Abraham said.</p><p>  在他们观察的目光下，他整理着儿童和青少年的尸体时，泪流满面，从口袋里收集身份证，并对他们的衣服或发型做细致的记录。亚伯拉罕说，有些是完全被认出的，被枪杀了。</p><p> Then he covered their bodies with earth and thorny tree branches, praying that they wouldn&#39;t be washed away, or carried off by prowling hyenas and circling vultures. Finally he placed their shoes on top of the burial mounds, so he could return with their parents to identify them.</p><p> 然后，他用泥土和棘手的树枝遮住了他们的尸体，祈求它们不会被冲走，也不会被鬣狗和秃鹰盘旋而被带走。最终，他把他们的鞋子放在了土墩上，这样他就可以和他们的父母一起回去认出他们。</p><p>  &#34;Their hands were tied ... young children ... we saw them everywhere. There was an elderly man who had been killed on the road, an 80-something-year-old man. And the young kids they killed on the street in the open. I&#39;ve never seen a massacre like this and I don&#39;t want to [again],&#34; Abraham said.</p><p>  ＆＃34;他们的手被绑住了……年幼的孩子们……我们到处都看到了他们。路上有一个老人被杀，一个八十多岁的男人。还有他们在露天杀害的年幼孩子。我从未见过这样的大屠杀，我也不想[再次]亚伯拉罕说。</p><p>  Abraham said he buried more than 50 people that day, but estimates more than 100 died in the assault.</p><p>  亚伯拉罕说，他当天埋葬了50多人，但估计有100多人在袭击中丧生。</p><p>   They&#39;re among thousands of civilians believed to have been killed since November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for resolving a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea,  launched a major military operation against the political party that governs the Tigray region. He accused the Tigray People&#39;s Liberation Front (TPLF), which ruled Ethiopia for nearly three decades before Abiy took office in 2018, of attacking a government military base and trying to steal weapons. The TPLF denies the claim.</p><p>   自11月以来，数千名平民被杀害。自11月埃塞俄比亚总理阿比·艾哈迈德（Abiy Ahmed）因解决与邻国厄立特里亚的长期冲突而获得2019年诺贝尔和平奖以来，他们发起了针对提格雷地区的政党。他指责提格雷人民解放阵线（TPLF）攻击政府军事基地并试图窃取武器，该阵线在埃比埃于2018年上任前统治埃塞俄比亚近三十年。 TPLF拒绝了该索赔。 </p><p> The conflict is the culmination of escalating tensions between the two sides, and the most dire of several recent ethno-nationalist clashes in Africa&#39;s second-most populous country.</p><p>冲突是双方之间紧张局势升级的最终结果，也是非洲第二人口大国最近发生的几次民族民族主义冲突中最可怕的一次。</p><p> After seizing control of Tigray&#39;s main cities in late November, Abiy declared victory and maintained that  no civilians were harmed in the offensive. Abiy has also denied that soldiers from Eritrea crossed into Tigray to support Ethiopian forces.</p><p> 在11月下旬夺取了提格雷的主要城市的控制权后，阿比宣告获胜，并坚持认为没有任何平民在这次进攻中受到伤害。阿比还否认厄立特里亚士兵越过提格里来支持埃塞俄比亚部队。</p><p>   But the fighting has raged on in rural and mountainous areas where the TPLF and its armed supporters are reportedly hiding out, resisting Abiy&#39;s drive to consolidate power. The violence has spilled over into local communities, catching civilians in the crossfire and triggering what the  United Nations refugee agency has called the worst flight of refugees from the region in two decades.</p><p>   但是战斗在农村和山区展开，据报道，特遣部队及其武装支持者躲藏在那里，抵制阿比（Abiy）巩固权力的努力。暴力事件已蔓延到当地社区，在交火中俘虏平民，并触发了联合国难民署所谓的二十年来难民从该地区逃离的最惨重的旅程。</p><p> The  UN special adviser on genocide prevention said in early February that the organization had received multiple reports of &#34;extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, looting, mass executions and impeded humanitarian access.&#34;</p><p> 联合国预防种族灭绝问题特别顾问在2月初表示，该组织已收到多起关于“法外处决，性暴力，抢劫，大规模处决和人道主义准入受到阻碍的报道”。</p><p> Many of those abuses have been blamed on Eritrean soldiers, whose presence on the ground suggests that Abiy&#39;s much-lauded peace deal with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki set the stage for the two sides to wage war against the TPLF -- their mutual enemy.</p><p> 这些虐待中有许多被归咎于厄立特里亚士兵，他们在实地的存在表明阿比与厄立特里亚总统以赛亚·阿弗韦基的备受赞誉的和平协议为双方发动了对TPLF的战争-他们的相互敌人。</p><p> The US State Department, in a statement to CNN, called for Eritrean forces to be &#34;withdrawn from Tigray immediately,&#34; citing credible reports of their involvement in &#34;deeply troubling conduct.&#34; In response to CNN&#39;s findings, the spokesperson said &#34;reports of a massacre at Maryam Dengelat are gravely concerning and demand an independent investigation.&#34;</p><p> 美国国务院在给美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）的声明中，呼吁厄立特里亚部队立即从提格雷（Tigray）撤出，引用了有关他们参与“令人不安的行为”的可信报告。发言人在回应CNN的调查结果时说，玛丽安·登格拉特（Maryam Dengelat）发生的大屠杀报告令人严重关切，需要进行独立调查。</p><p> Ethiopia responded to CNN&#39;s request for comment with a statement that did not directly address the attack in Dengelat. The government said it would &#34;continue bringing all perpetrators to justice following thorough investigations into alleged crimes in the region,&#34; but gave no details about those investigations.</p><p> 埃塞俄比亚对CNN的置评请求作出回应，该声明未直接解决在登格拉特（Dengelat）的袭击事件。政府表示，将在对该地区涉嫌犯罪进行彻底调查后，将继续将所有肇事者绳之以法。但没有提供有关这些调查的详细信息。 </p><p>   CNN has reached out for comment to Eritrea, which has yet to respond. On Friday, the  government vehemently denied its soldiers had committed atrocities during another massacre in Tigray reported by Amnesty International.</p><p>美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）已向厄立特里亚（Eritrea）征求评论，但尚未作出回应。国际特赦组织报道，星期五，政府坚决否认其士兵在提格雷发生另一场屠杀期间犯下了暴行。</p><p> The TPLF said in a statement to CNN that its forces were nowhere near Dengelat at the time of the massacre. It rejected that the victims could have been mistaken for being TPLF and called for a UN investigation to hold all sides accountable for atrocities committed during the conflict.</p><p> TPLF在给CNN的声明中说，大屠杀发生时，它的部队不在Dengelat附近。它拒绝认为受害者可能被误认为是TPLF，并呼吁联合国进行调查，以使各方对冲突期间犯下的暴行负责。</p><p> Still, the situation inside the country remains opaque. Ethiopia&#39;s government has severely restricted access to journalists and  prevented most aid from reaching areas beyond the government&#39;s control, making it challenging to verify accounts from survivors. And an intermittent communications blackout during the fighting has effectively blocked the war from the world&#39;s eyes.</p><p> 尽管如此，该国内部的局势仍然不透明。埃塞俄比亚政府严格限制了与记者的接触，并阻止大多数援助到达政府控制范围之外的地区，这使得核实幸存者的账目变得颇具挑战性。战斗期间间歇性的通信中断有效地阻止了这场战争。</p><p> Now that curtain is being pulled back, as witnesses fleeing parts of Tigray reach internet access and phone lines are restored. They detail a disastrous conflict that has given rise to ethnic violence, including attacks on churches and mosques.</p><p> 现在，随着逃离提格里部分地区的目击者可以访问互联网并恢复了电话线，窗帘被拉回了。他们详细介绍了一场灾难性的冲突，该冲突引起了种族暴力，包括对教堂和清真寺的袭击。</p><p> For months, rumors spread of a grisly assault on an Orthodox church in Dengelat. A list of the dead began circulating on social media in early December, shared among the Tigrayan diaspora. Then photos of the deceased, including young children, started cropping up online.</p><p> 数月以来，谣言四起，对登格拉特的东正教教堂进行了严厉的袭击。死者名单于12月初开始在社交媒体上流传，在Tigrayan散居海外的人中分享。然后，死者的照片，包括年幼的孩子，开始在网上出现。</p><p> Through a network of activists and relatives, CNN tracked down eyewitnesses to the attack. In countless phone calls -- many disconnected and dropped -- Abraham and others provided the most detailed account of the deadly massacre to date.</p><p> 通过活动家和亲戚的网络，CNN追踪了目击者的目击。在无数的电话中-许多人断线和掉线-亚伯拉罕和其他人提供了迄今为止致命屠杀的最详尽的描述。</p><p>   Eyewitnesses said that the festival started much as it had any other year. Footage of the celebrations from 2019 shows priests dressed in white ceremonial robes and crowns, carrying crosses aloft, leading hundreds of people in prayer at Maryam Dengelat church. The faithful sang, danced and ululated in unison.</p><p>   目击者说，这个节日与其他年份一样开始了很多。 2019年庆祝活动的录像显示，祭司身着白色礼袍和王冠，高举十字架，带领数百人在Maryam Dengelat教堂祈祷。忠实的歌声一致地唱歌，跳舞和跳舞。 </p><p> As prayers concluded in the early hours of November 30, Abraham looked out from the hilltop where the church is perched to see troops arriving by foot, followed by more soldiers in trucks. At first, they were peaceful, he said. They were invited to eat, and rested under the shade of a tree grove.</p><p>当祈祷在11月30日凌晨结束时，亚伯拉罕从教堂所在的山顶上望出去，看到部队步行到达，随后有更多的士兵乘坐卡车。他说，起初，他们是和平的。邀请他们吃饭，并在树荫下休息。</p><p> But, as congregants were celebrating mass around midday, shelling and gunfire erupted, sending people fleeing up mountain paths and into nearby homes.</p><p> 但是，正当整群人庆祝中午弥撒之际，炮击和枪声突然爆发，使人们逃离山路进入附近的房屋。</p><p> Desta, who helped with preparations for the festival, said he was at the church when troops arrived at the village entrance, blocking off the road and firing shots. He heard people screaming and fled, running up Ziqallay mountainside. From the rocky plateau he surveyed the chaos playing out below.</p><p> 德斯塔为节日的筹备工作提供了帮助，他说，当部队到达村庄入口时，他正在教堂，封锁道路并开枪。他听到人们尖叫并逃跑，在Ziqallay山腰上奔跑。从多岩石的高原上，他观察了下面发生的混乱情况。</p><p> We could see people running here and there ... [the soldiers] were killing everyone who was coming from the church,&#34; Desta said.</p><p> 我们可以看到有人在这里和那里跑来跑去……[士兵]杀死了所有从教堂来的人，＆＃34;德斯塔说。</p><p> Eight eyewitnesses said they could tell the troops were Eritrean, based on their uniforms and dialect. Some speculated that soldiers were meting out revenge by targeting young men, assuming they were members of the TPLF forces or allied local militias. But Abraham and others maintained there were no militia in Dengelat or the church.</p><p> 八名目击者说，根据他们的制服和方言，他们可以说这支部队是厄立特里亚人。一些人推测，士兵们是针对青年男子的报复，假设他们是TPLF部队或当地同盟民兵的成员。但是亚伯拉罕和其他人坚持认为，登格拉特（Dengelat）或教堂里没有民兵。</p><p> Marta, who was visiting Dengelat for the holiday, says she left the church with her husband Biniam after morning prayers. As the newlyweds walked back to their relative&#39;s home, a stream of people began sprinting up the hill, shouting that soldiers were rounding people up in the village.</p><p> 玛塔（Marta）假期前往登格拉特（Dengelat）度假，她说她在早上祈祷后与丈夫比尼亚姆（Biniam）离开教堂。当新婚夫妇回到他们的亲戚家时，一群人开始冲刺上山，大喊着士兵正在村里围捕人们。</p><p>   She recalled the horrifying moment soldiers arrived at their house, shooting into the compound and calling out: &#34;Come out, come out you b*tches.&#34; Marta said they went outside holding their identity cards aloft, saying &#34;we&#39;re civilians.&#34; But the troops opened fire anyway, hitting Biniam, his sister and several others.</p><p>   她回忆起士兵们到达他们的房子，向大院开枪并大喊一声的恐怖时刻：＆＃34;出来，出来给你打招呼。＆＃34;玛尔塔（Marta）说，他们高举身份证出门，说我们是平民。但是无论如何，部队开了火，击中了Biniam，他的妹妹和其他几个人。 </p><p> &#34;I was holding Bini, he wasn&#39;t dead ... I thought he was going to survive, but he died [in my arms].</p><p>我抱着比尼，他没死……我以为他会活下来，但他死在了我的怀里。</p><p> The couple had just been married in October. Marta found out after the massacre that she was pregnant.</p><p> 这对夫妇刚刚在十月份结婚。玛塔在大屠杀后发现她怀孕了。</p><p> After the soldiers left, Marta, who said she was shot in the hand, helped drag the seven bodies inside, so that the hyenas wouldn&#39;t eat them. &#34;We slept near the bodies ... and we couldn&#39;t bury them because they [the soldiers] were still there,&#34; she said.</p><p> 士兵们离开后，称自己被枪杀的玛尔塔（Marta）帮助将七个尸体拖入其中，以免鬣狗吃掉它们。我们睡在尸体附近，因为他们[士兵]还在那里，所以我们无法掩埋他们，＆＃34;她说。</p><p>   Marta and other eyewitnesses described soldiers going house to house through Dengelat, dragging people outside, binding their hands or asking others to do so, and then shooting them.</p><p>   玛尔塔（Marta）和其他目击者描述了士兵们通过登格拉特（Dengelat）挨家挨户，将人们拖到外面，束缚他们的手或要求他人这样做，然后开枪射击他们。</p><p> Rahwa, who was part of the Sunday school group from Edaga Hamus and left Dengelat earlier than others, managing to escape being killed, said mothers were forced to tie up their sons.</p><p> 拉瓦（Rahwa）是埃达加·哈穆斯（Edaga Hamus）的星期日学校小组的成员，比其他人更早离开登格拉特（Dengelat），设法逃脱了被杀的命运。他说，母亲被迫绑上自己的儿子。</p><p> &#34;They were ordering their mothers to tie their sons&#39; hands. They were taking them barefoot and killing them in front of their mothers,&#34; Rahwa said eyewitnesses told her.</p><p> 他们正在命令母亲绑儿子。手。他们赤脚地把他们带走，并在母亲面前杀死他们，＆＃34;拉瓦说目击者告诉她。</p><p> Samuel, another eyewitness, said that he had eaten and drank with the soldiers before they came to his house, which is just behind the church, and killed his relatives. He said he survived by hiding underneath one of their bodies for hours.</p><p> 另一位目击者塞缪尔（Samuel）说，他在士兵们来到教堂后面的他的房子之前，已经与他们一起吃饭和喝酒，并杀死了他的亲戚。他说，他通过躲藏在他们的尸体下面几个小时而得以幸存。 </p><p> &#34;They started pushing the people out of their houses and they were killing all children, women and old men. After they killed them outside their houses, they were looting and taking all the property,&#34; Samuel said.</p><p>＆＃34;他们开始将人们赶出家门，并且正在杀死所有儿童，妇女和老人。他们在房屋外杀死他们后，正在抢劫并抢走所有财产，＆＃34;塞缪尔说。</p><p> As the violence raged, hundreds of people remained in the church hall. In a lull in the gunfire, priests advised those who could to go home, ushering them outside. Several of the priests were killed as they left the church, Abraham said.</p><p> 暴力肆虐之时，数百人仍留在教堂大厅里。牧师在枪声中平静下来，劝告那些可以回家的人，将他们带到外面。亚伯拉罕说，有几位神父在离开教堂时被杀。</p><p> With nowhere to run to, Abraham sheltered inside Maryam Dengelat, lying on the floor as artillery pounded the tin roof. &#34;We lost hope and we decided to stay and die at the church. We didn&#39;t try to run,&#34; he said.</p><p> 由于无处可逃，亚伯拉罕躲在Maryam Dengelat内，躺在炮弹撞击铁皮屋顶的地板上。 ＆＃34;我们失去了希望，我们决定留在教堂里死去。我们没有尝试运行，他说。</p><p> Two days later, the troops called parishioners down from the church to deal with the dead. Abraham said he and five other men spent the day burying bodies, including those from Marta&#39;s household and the Sunday school children. But the troops forbid them from burying bodies at the church, in line with Orthodox tradition, and forced them to make mass graves instead -- a practice that has been described elsewhere in Tigray.</p><p> 两天后，部队从教堂召集教区居民来对付死者。亚伯拉罕说，他和其他五名男子整日埋葬尸体，包括玛塔家和周日学童的尸体。但是，部队禁止他们按照东正教的传统将尸体埋在教堂里，并强迫他们改做万人冢-这种做法在提格雷的其他地方都有描述。</p><p>   Abraham shared photos and videos of the grave sites, which CNN geolocated to Dengelat with the help of satellite image analysis from several experts. The analysis was unable to conclusively identify individual graves, which witnesses said were shallow, but one expert said there were signs that parts of the landscape had changed.</p><p>   亚伯拉罕分享了这些墓地的照片和视频，在几位专家的卫星图像分析的帮助下，CNN将这些遗址和照片地理定位在登格拉特。该分析无法最终确定单个坟墓，目击者称这些坟墓很浅，但一位专家表示，有迹象表明部分景观已发生变化。</p><p> The initial bloodshed was followed by a period of two tense weeks, Abraham said. Soldiers stayed in the area in several encampments, stealing cars, burning crops and killing livestock before eventually moving on.</p><p> 亚伯拉罕说，最初的流血事件发生后是两个紧张星期。在最终继续前进之前，士兵们在该地区数个营地中停留，偷车，焚烧农作物并杀死牲畜。</p><p> Tedros, who was born in Dengelat and traveled there after the soldiers had left, said that the village smelled of death and that vultures were circling over the mountains, a sign that there may be more bodies left uncounted there.</p><p> 特德罗斯（Tedros）出生在登格拉特（Dengelat），在士兵们离开后曾去过那里。他说，这个村庄闻到了死亡的气息，秃鹰在山上盘旋，这表明那里可能还有更多的尸体被遗忘了。 </p><p> &#34;Some of them were also killed in the far fields while they were trying to escape and most of them were eaten by vultures before they got buried, it was horrible. [The soldiers] tied them and killed them in front of their doors, and they shot them in the head just to save bullets,&#34; he said.</p><p>＆＃34;其中一些人在试图逃跑的同时也被杀害。他们中的大多数人在被埋葬之前被秃v吞噬，这太可怕了。 [士兵们]绑住他们，并杀死他们在门前，然后将他们开枪射中头部以保存子弹，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> Tedros visited the burial grounds described by eyewitnesses and said he saw cracks in the church walls where artillery hit. In interviews with villagers and family members, he compiled a death toll of more than 70 people.</p><p> 特德罗斯（Tedros）参观了目击者描述的墓地，并说他在教堂墙壁上发现了大炮击中的裂缝。在与村民和家庭成员的访谈中，他汇总了70多人的死亡人数。</p><p> The families hope that the names of their loved ones, which Tedros, Abraham and others risked their lives to record, will eventually be read out at a traditional funeral ceremony at the Maryam Dengelat church -- rare closure in an ongoing conflict.</p><p> 他们的家人希望，特德罗斯，亚伯拉罕和其他人冒着生命危险记录下来的亲人的名字最终将在玛丽安姆·登格拉特教堂的传统葬礼上宣读，这在正在进行的冲突中很少发生。</p><p> Three months after the massacre, the graves in Dengelat are a daily reminder of the bloodshed for the survivors who remain in the village. But it has not yet been safe enough to rebury the bodies of those who died, and that reality is weighing on them.</p><p> 屠杀发生三个月后，登格拉特（Dengelat）的坟墓每天提醒着留在村里的幸存者的流血事件。但是，它还不够安全，无法掩埋死者的尸体，而现实正在使他们沉重。</p><p>     Correction: An on-screen title in an earlier version of the video in this story misstated the date of CNN-obtained footage from Tigray. It was filmed in 2021.</p><p>     更正：该故事中视频的早期版本中的屏幕标题误以为从Tigray获得CNN素材的日期错了。它是在2021年拍摄的。</p><p> Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported.
