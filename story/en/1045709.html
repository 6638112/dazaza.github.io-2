Some of the high profile actions had been signaled in advance—we&#39;re back in the Paris Agreement! The Keystone pipeline&#39;s been put on indefinite hold!</p><p>乔·拜登在上任的第一天晚上签署了一系列行政命令，其中包括重点关注环境法规。一些备受瞩目的行动已提前发出信号，我们又回到了《巴黎协定》！ Keystone管道已无限期搁置！</p><p> But the suite of executive orders includes a long list that targets plenty of the changes Trump made in energy and environmental policies, many of which will have more subtle but significant effects of how the United States does business. Many of those make major changes, in some cases by eliminating policies adopted during the Trump years, a number of which we covered at the time. So, we&#39;ve attempted to take a comprehensive look at Biden&#39;s actions and their potential impacts.</p><p> 但行政命令套件包括一长串清单，这些清单针对特朗普在能源和环境政策方面做出的许多改变，其中许多改变将对美国的经营方式产生更为微妙但重要的影响。其中许多做出了重大改变，在某些情况下，通过消除了特朗普时代采取的政策，我们当时涵盖了其中的许多政策。因此，我们试图全面了解拜登的行动及其潜在影响。</p><p>  Environmental and energy regulations are set through three main mechanisms. The first is by specific laws, which would require the cooperation of both houses of Congress to change. Next are also more general laws, like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. These enable regulations to be put in place via a formal rule-making process run by the agencies of the executive branch. This process involves soliciting public feedback, incorporating economic considerations, and so on, a process that typically takes anywhere from eight months to over a year. Finally, the executive branch can set policies to cover details not spelled out by the law or the rule, such as how to handle things like deadlines and enforcement details.</p><p>  环境和能源法规是通过三个主要机制制定的。首先是通过具体法律，这将需要国会两院的合作进行改变。其次是更普遍的法律，例如《清洁空气和清洁水法》。这些使法规可以通过由行政部门的机构运行的正式规则制定过程来制定。此过程涉及征求公众反馈，纳入经济考虑因素等，该过程通常需要八个月到一年以上的时间。最后，行政部门可以设置政策以涵盖法律或法规未明确规定的细节，例如如何处理截止日期和执行细节。</p><p> It&#39;s these latter two categories where President Biden can act immediately, since they&#39;re left entirely to the executive branch, although subject to legal review. And that&#39;s precisely what he&#39;s done, by ordering reviews of existing rules established during the Trump administration and changing myriad policies put in place by prior executive orders.</p><p> 拜登总统可以在这后两个类别中立即采取行动，因为尽管受到法律审查，但它们完全留给了行政部门。而这正是他所做的，是通过命令对特朗普政府期间制定的现有规则进行审查，并更改以前的行政命令所制定的无数政策。</p><p> The  Congressional Review Act also allows federal rules that have been enacted within the past 60 days to be overturned by a joint resolution of the two houses of Congress. The clock is still running on a number of Trump rules and, with Democrats controlling both houses, there&#39;s a chance we&#39;ll see action here. But on his first day in office, Biden was taking no chances, and he targeted these rules along with a list of many that are outside the 60-day window.</p><p> 《国会审查法》还允许在过去60天内制定的联邦法规被国会两院的联合决议推翻。时钟仍然按照特朗普的许多规则运行，民主党控制着两院，我们有机会在这里看到行动。但是在拜登上任的第一天，拜登就毫不留情了，他将这些规则与60天期限以外的许多规则作为目标。</p><p>  Trump-era policies often attempted to eliminate existing policies and cripple any future adoption of new ones. Perhaps the most striking of these was in Executive Order 13771, which flatly declared that any new regulation could only be adopted if two existing regulations were eliminated. The order gave no consideration to details like the total number of regulations that were available to eliminate or whether existing regulations were effective and/or efficient. Furthermore, the net economic impact on those regulated by the new and canceled rules had to be zero.</p><p>  特朗普时代的政策经常试图消除现有政策，并削弱将来采用新政策的能力。其中最引人注目的也许是第13771号行政命令，该命令断然宣布，只有删除两个现有法规，才能采用任何新法规。该命令未考虑任何细节，例如可消除的法规总数或现有法规是否有效。此外，新规则和已取消规则对那些规则的净经济影响必须为零。</p><p>    Another executive order established &#34;regulatory reform officers&#34; in every agency that were supposed to help in the identification of regulations that were out-of-date or costly, and target those for elimination. Another demanded that guidance documents, which agencies issue in order to help companies comply with regulations, could never contain phrasing that might be interpreted as creating regulations. Order 13892 required that any enforcement of regulations had to wait to allow those subject to the enforcement time to respond to the proposed action.</p><p>    另一个行政命令设立了监管改革官员。在每个应该帮助识别过时或代价高昂的法规的机构中，并以消除这些法规为目标。另一位代表要求，由机构发行以帮助公司遵守法规的指导文件绝不能包含可能被解释为制定法规的措辞。 13892号命令要求法规的任何执行都必须等待，以使那些受执行时间影响的人可以对拟议的行动做出回应。 </p><p> All of these Executive Orders are now gone. Citing the need for policies that tackle climate change and the pandemic, Biden&#39;s new Executive Order describes them as &#34;harmful policies and directives that threaten to frustrate the Federal Government’s ability to confront these problems&#34; in justifying their elimination.</p><p>所有这些行政命令现在都消失了。拜登的新行政命令援引了应对气候变化和大流行的政策的必要性，将其描述为有害的政策和指令，有可能使联邦政府面对这些问题的能力受挫。为消除它们辩护。</p><p> More difficult to deal with are actions that have gone through the full federal rule-making process. These include a number of efforts intended to make future rules more difficult to adopt. Notable among them:</p><p> 更难处理的是已经经历了整个联邦规则制定过程的行动。这些包括许多旨在使将来的规则更难采用的努力。其中值得注意的是：</p><p> The EPA decided that incidental benefits of pollution limits  wouldn&#39;t count towards the consideration of costs and benefits of regulations. In other words, if a regulation cost $100 in cleanup costs but avoided $100,000,000 in health care costs, only the first figure would matter during the rule-making process..</p><p> EPA决定，污染限值的附带收益将不计入法规成本和收益。换句话说，如果一项法规的清理成本为100美元，而医疗保健成本却避免了1亿美元，那么在制定规则的过程中，只有第一个数字才有意义。</p><p> The EPA has changed its standards of evidence for studies on pollution harm so that epidemiological evidence on its own  would not be sufficient to trigger regulation.</p><p> EPA改变了其关于污染危害研究的证据标准，因此仅靠流行病学证据不足以触发监管。</p><p> Not content with that, the agency has determined that epidemiological evidence that incorporates patient data  can&#39;t be used if privacy concerns keep the underlying data from being made public.</p><p> 该机构不满足于此，它确定，如果出于隐私考虑而使基础数据无法公开，则无法使用包含患者数据的流行病学证据。</p><p> Biden cannot unilaterally eliminate these rules. But all agency heads have now been directed to review any rule adopted during the entire Trump administration to determine whether they run contrary to Biden&#39;s policy goals. And the final rule, having been adopted recently, are subject to an Executive Order to agency heads that directs them to suspend recent rules and re-open them for public comment as a route to enabling a replacement rule to be formulated. Any rules that are currently tied up in court will see the Justice Department ask for the case to be suspended while the relevant agencies revisit the rules.</p><p> 拜登不能单方面消除这些规则。但是现在已指示所有机构负责人审查整个特朗普政府期间通过的任何规则，以确定它们是否违反拜登的政策目标。最近通过的最终规则受制于机构负责人的行政命令，该命令指示各机构负责人暂缓最近的规则，并重新开放以征询公众意见，以作为制定替代规则的途径。目前在法庭上受约束的任何规则，将在相关机构重新审查规则的同时，由司法部要求中止。</p><p>  Beyond these efforts, the early executive orders target a lot of efforts by Trump to block Obama-era policies. These include a new look at Trump&#39;s effort to  weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards, but go well beyond that. Other targets include Trump&#39;s elimination of Obama-era rules on  methane emissions from fossil fuel extraction, and the Obama-era Waters of the USA rules. In their initial formulation, these treated things like small ponds and seasonal streams as part of a single, interlinked water system that was regulated under the Clean Water Act. Trump reversed the rule; Biden will consider reviving it. Fossil fuel extraction in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was prohibited under Obama, opened for leasing by Trump, and will likely be blocked again by Biden.</p><p>  除了这些努力之外，早期的行政命令还针对特朗普为阻止奥巴马时代的政策做出的大量努力。这些包括重新审视特朗普为削弱奥巴马时代的燃油经济性标准所做的努力，但远不止于此。其他目标包括特朗普废除奥巴马时代的化石燃料开采甲烷排放法规，以及奥巴马时代的美国水域法规。在其最初的表述中，这些处理过的东西如小池塘和季节性溪流，是受《清洁水法》监管的单一，相互联系的水系统的一部分。特朗普推翻了规则；拜登将考虑恢复它。奥巴马禁止在北极国家野生动物保护区中提取化石燃料，特朗普将其开放供租赁，拜登有可能再次将其封锁。 </p><p> Fossil fuel extraction plays a major role in the policies Biden is reconsidering or reversing. One Trump Executive Order attempted to limit the use of the Clean Water Act to block energy development, the ability of state laws to limit export of fossil fuels, and, most bizarrely for a party that was supposedly enthused about the free market, targeted retirement funds that were limiting their holdings in the energy sector. That Order has been eliminated in its entirely.</p><p>化石燃料的提取在拜登重新考虑或逆转的政策中起着重要作用。一项特朗普行政命令试图限制使用《清洁水法》来阻止能源发展，限制州法律限制化石燃料出口的能力，最奇怪的是，对于一个对自由市场充满热情的政党，有针对性的退休基金限制了他们在能源领域的持股。该命令已被完全消除。</p><p>    Trump also pushed efforts to favor energy development at the expense of the application of laws such as the Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and Endangered species act. Biden has reversed the policies that resulted. Other Orders targeted by Biden include ones that promote offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic, and another that ordered a review of whether National Monuments got in the way of energy development.</p><p>    特朗普还推动了支持能源发展的努力，但以《清洁水法》，《国家环境政策法》和《濒危物种法》等法律的实施为代价。拜登推翻了由此产生的政策。拜登针对的其他命令包括促进墨西哥湾和北极海上钻探的命令，以及下令审查国家纪念碑是否阻碍能源发展的命令。</p><p> Trump actions to limit the size of several of these national monuments are also being reversed. These include Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in the Southwest, as well as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts offshore reserve off the coast of Maine.</p><p> 特朗普为限制其中一些国家历史古迹的规模而采取的行动也已被撤销。其中包括西南部的Bears Ears和Grand Staircase-Escalante，以及缅因州沿海的东北峡谷和海山海上保护区。</p><p> Trump&#39;s somewhat bizarre objections to efficiency rules for lightbulbs and appliance (notably toilets) led to the elimination of some of those. They&#39;ll be back now. Other</p><p> 特朗普对灯泡和家用电器（特别是厕所）的效率规则有些离奇的异议，导致其中的一些淘汰。他们现在会回来。其他</p><p>  Other actions taken so far suggest that Biden continues to be serious about his promise to  bring science back into policy decisions. Trump had issued an executive order that targeted advisory committees, one of the ways that policymakers in the executive branch can solicit input from scientists (as well as those in industry and elsewhere). In recent years, there have typically been roughly 1,000 advisory committees active at any point. Trump had issued an Executive Order that sought a rapid elimination of about a third of those, and set a long-term target of having only 300 active. Those limits are gone.</p><p>  迄今为止采取的其他行动表明，拜登继续认真对待将科学重新纳入决策的承诺。特朗普发布了针对咨询委员会的行政命令，这是行政部门的政策制定者可以征求科学家（以及行业和其他领域的科学家）意见的一种方式。近年来，通常在任何时候都活跃着大约1,000个咨询委员会。特朗普发布了一项行政命令，要求迅速消除其中的三分之一，并设定了长期目标，即只有300人活跃。这些限制已经消失了。</p><p> Trump also blocked the use of a figure called the social cost of carbon, which attempts to use the future consequences of climate change to determine the cost of present-day emissions. Biden isn&#39;t just reversing that decision. He&#39;s expanding it so that it&#39;s applied to two additional greenhouse gasses, methane and nitrous oxide. His executive order establishes an inter-agency working group that&#39;s charged with producing an initial estimate within 30 days. This will allow the entire federal government to perform cost-benefit analyses for climate-related regulations, something that&#39;s often a legal requirement.</p><p> 特朗普还阻止了一个称为碳的社会成本的数字的使用，该数字试图利用气候变化的未来后果来确定当今的排放成本。拜登不仅推翻了这一决定。他正在对其进行扩展，以便将其应用于另外两种温室气体：甲烷和一氧化二氮。他的行政命令建立了一个机构间工作组，负责在30天内提供初步估算。这将使整个联邦政府能够对与气候相关的法规进行成本效益分析，而这通常是法律要求。</p><p>  A lot of the other Executive Orders revoked by Biden were cases where Trump directed agencies to re-evaluate existing regulations to determine if they were efficient, cost effective, overlapped with other regulations, or had simply been obviated by scientific or market developments. There was nothing obviously problematic with many aspects of these Orders, which makes their elimination by Biden seem somewhat capricious—why would he object to the identification of ineffective regulations?</p><p>  拜登撤销了许多其他行政命令，这些案件是特朗普指示各机构重新评估现有法规，以确定它们是否有效，具有成本效益，是否与其他法规重叠，或者只是由于科学或市场发展而被废除。这些命令的许多方面显然没有问题，这使得拜登将其消除似乎有些反复无常-为什么他反对确定无效的法规？ </p><p> It&#39;s important to recognize that, despite the apparently neutral language, the Orders were meant to enable the Trump administration to eliminate regulations with no regard for their effectiveness. Through their elimination, Biden will free up staff to pursue new policy initiatives, and restore government capacity that has been lost during the previous four years. How you feel about that will likely be determined by your attitudes towards regulations in general.</p><p>重要的是要认识到，尽管使用了表面上中立的语言，但《命令》的目的是使特朗普政府能够消除法规，而不考虑其有效性。通过淘汰，拜登将释放工作人员以采取新的政策措施，并恢复过去四年中失去的政府能力。您对此的感觉可能将取决于您对法规的总体态度。</p><p> Overall, many of the decisions here are basic policy reversals—decisions about whether to limit Clean Water Act enforcement in order to foster energy development, for example. But underlying most of them is a clear policy vision that places addressing climate change as a very high priority, and attempts to redirect existing laws to better reflect both that priority and the  rapidly changing economic reality that makes doing so much less challenging than it was during the Obama Administration.</p><p> 总体而言，这里的许多决定都是基本的政策逆转，例如，有关是否限制《清洁水法》执行以促进能源发展的决定。但是其中大多数是基于清晰的政策愿景，将应对气候变化作为当务之急，并试图重定向现有法律，以更好地反映这一优先事项和快速变化的经济现实，这使得在此过程中所面临的挑战比以前减少了很多奥巴马政府。</p><p> With control of both houses of Congress, Biden should eventually be able to get new laws passed that allow these policy objectives to be pursued more effectively. But his opening actions indicate he&#39;s not willing to wait for that, or chance the prospect of gridlock dominating the Capital for the next two years.</p><p> 在国会两院的控制下，拜登最终应该能够通过新法律，从而更有效地实现这些政策目标。但是他的开场白表明他不愿意等待，也没有机会在未来两年内陷入僵局，统治首都。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/a-look-at-all-of-bidens-changes-to-energy-and-environmental-regulations/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/a-look-at-all-of-bidens-changes-to-energy-and-environmental-regulations/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/环境/">#环境</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/energy/">#energy</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/法规/">#法规</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
