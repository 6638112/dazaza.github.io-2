", "note_en": "Title is literally true. This may not be the best place to learn about these concepts for the first time, because I&#39;m going to focus on knocking down the misconceptions about them.\n  I had promised myself I would not add to the pile of functor or monad &#34;tutorials&#34;, but I&#39;ve been worn down. I gave up when I saw a reddit comment complaining about how Functor was &#34;too hard to understand&#34;, which made me sad, because the correct response to the Functor interface is, &#34;That&#39;s it?&#34;. And while Monad is legitimately a bit more interesting and complex, the correct response to that is not that different.\n I am aware of the notorious effect that people &#34;get&#34; monads and then post their own idiosyncratic takes on them. In my defense, this isn&#39;t something I write just after my &#34;ah ha!&#34; moment, I&#39;ve understood them in Haskell&#39;s context for many years now, and actually... this isn&#39;t even about that &#34;ah ha!&#34; moment at all. This is only about  what they are. Even if you completely understand everything I write in this post, the real &#34;ah ha!&#34; where you realize just how useful the libraries built up around the monad interface are, the first time you search for a type on  Hoogle where you&#39;re like  this should exist and it turns out it does in fact exist already, that&#39;s still in your future. In fact I&#39;m quite  deliberately not trying to convey that feeling in the interests of getting at simply  what the monad interface is. Which isn&#39;t, strictly speaking, a pre-requisite to that experience, but it does help.\n    Fact: If you have a source of  Blobs, and a function that can turn a  Blob into a  Thing, you can put them together to create a source of  Things.\n  If I have A: a list of integers, and B: a function to convert integers to strings, I can easily create C: a list of strings.\n If I have A: a hash table of integers to strings, and B: a function to convert strings to booleans, I can have C: a hash table of integers to booleans.\n Duh. Obviously. The only reason it sounds even slightly complicated is just that English doesn&#39;t have a good equivalent for a &#34;variable&#34;, so it always sounds complicated when you have a sentence with them. The concept itself is, if not ELI5, well within the ELI12 range.\n I don&#39;t say  how I get from A and B to C. Each case is different, but simple every time. Takes more English words to say it than implementing it in your favorite language would.\n What is functor then? Functor is an  interface (or &#34;trait&#34;, &#34;concept&#34;, &#34;typeclass&#34; or whatever your language favors; &#34;interface&#34; from now on as I am deliberately trying to use more common terminology) that allows you to refer to the fact above as a first-class language element. In Haskell&#39;s case,  Functor, which is implemented by providing an  fmap implementation. For the above examples, that function will:\n List implementation: Take the function in B and run it on all my elements and return a new list, commonly called  map.\n Hash table implementation: Take the function in B and run it on all my values, return a new hash table with the same keys and new values.\n Function implementation: Return a function that runs the function in A, then runs the function in B on the result. This is commonly called function composition.\n The last one is slightly tricky, but if you think of functions in their metaphor as black boxes that take input on the left and provide their output on the right, that&#39;s just taking the second function and slamming it on the right side of the first to create a new one. This is why I say &#34;source of&#34; something; the principle here is  very general and extends beyond functions, containers, and all the other convenient words I have... it applies to  anything you might obtain a value from.\n   That is literally all it is; a way of discussing that simple operation coherently across a whole bunch of types.\n  Because even setting aside the occasional outright writer confusion, it&#39;s easy to get too excited in a blog post and end up conflating  what a functor is with  what we can build on it.\n I&#39;m going to repeatedly analogize to a more commonly-understood interface throughout the rest of this post: Iterator. Why is Functor &#34;important&#34; or &#34;interesting&#34;? For the same reason the iterator interface is. Iterators existed since the beginning of programming, just as &#34;functors&#34; did. Individual iterator implementations are typically quite boring, sometimes even outright trivial, like iterating along an array. But if you have a whole bunch of ad-hoc implementations of &#34;iterators&#34; that don&#39;t fit together, you can&#39;t create an  itertools package. Once you have a common contract and a coherent name, you can start building on top of what used to be a chaotic mess of almost-but-not-quite-the-same implementations.\n As a modern example of a language missing this, Go lacks any sort of language or library support for &#34;iterators&#34;, and consequently there are at least three iteration patterns in common use and a modestly common antipattern (using  range over channels, which has decent semantics but horrible performance for most use cases). Lacking this concept, Go also lacks anything like  itertools or a similarly-useful library.\n It is exactly the same with functor. Just as a variety of functions are now possible and useful that only know they are taking &#34;an iterator&#34;, by having a named, coherent &#34;functor&#34; concept in the language functions can be written that take advantage of the common functionality.\n It is important not to credit complexity of particular implementations to the complexity of the interface. Behind an interface of  function () string could lie a constant return of some particular string, or  a series of events that takes nearly a full book to explain by fetching a web page and returning its text... but the latter&#39;s complexity should be accounted solely to that particular implementation, not the  function () string interface it can conform to.\n Similarly, a functor may be as simple as mapping the incoming function over a list, or it may require an arbitrarily-complicated traversal over a data structure like a skip list and construction of a new one. But that is not a complicated operation because &#34;functors are complicated&#34;, it is a complicated operation because skip lists are complicated. The functor interface itself does not account for the complication.\n It is important not to credit the complexity of what we can  do with iterators to implementations of the interface. It is possible to take three iterators, reverse one of them, combine two others with a reduction function, and take only the prime indexed values from the result, but that doesn&#39;t affect the fact that an iterator is just a function you call to get &#34;the next value&#34;.\n   For their own good reasons, mathematicians use &#34;functor&#34; as a concrete noun. Haskell copied this, hence how often you hear about &#34;a functor&#34;.\n However, interfaces are  adjectives that describe a data structure, which is why in many languages they are often named with  -able suffixes (Iterable, Serializable, etc.) Programmers are better off thinking of it as Functable or Fmapable or something like that.\n Unfortunately, we do not have a pre-existing verb form for &#34;using the Functor interface&#34; the way we have &#34;iterate on&#34; for Iterable or &#34;serialize&#34; for Serializable. The closest we have is &#34;map on&#34;, and that is deceptive because that term usually has the mental image of some concrete data structure, possibly only and exactly a list, being mapped on, despite it being much more general. I recommend taking a nonsense term like Functable and owning it, rather than jamming a square concept into a round concept hole.\n If you find yourself confused, I recommend literally saying &#34;Functable&#34; to yourself. Eventually you will naturally start to hear Functor as just a synonym for how you say it to yourself. You may also consider &#34;Functionable&#34;, which is perilously close to &#34;functional&#34;, but carries the idea of &#34;we can apply a function to it&#34;, albeit a very particular function with a certain signature.\n In the context of the post you are reading right now, this may feel like nitpicking. However, I think it is actually a very significant contributor to the problem people have with understanding the functor and monad interfaces. I&#39;ve tried to carefully use those words in this post consistently as adjectives, because when you use them as nouns it becomes very confusing as you try to treat them as you treat most nouns. A lot of people speak as if you can have &#34;a functor&#34; or &#34;a monad&#34; in your hand, and start trying to talk about what they &#34;do&#34; stripped away from the context of the specific implementation in question. But you can&#39;t do that, any more than you can speak about the specific implementation of &#34;an iterator&#34; stripped away from what it is a specific implementation  for. Treating &#34;monad&#34; and &#34;functor&#34; as nouns leads to a lot of confusion.\n  Functor can be applied to a number of things that aren&#39;t containers. We&#39;ve seen that already with functions. It is a common mistake in non-Haskell implementations to assume that functor implementations can only go on containers.\n When I bring this up online, inevitably someone says something like &#34;Well, if you squint hard enough, functions are containers, and those other things are containers, and so on, so they do always work on containers.&#34; To that I say, if everything is a container, then the word container has no meaning. I think when you&#39;re rendering useful words meaningless just to conform to your misconceptions that you&#39;re stepping into a maze of mirrors that is only going to confuse you. The most sensible approach is to discard the misconception and understand that functors are not always containers.\n     looks like you are calling the function &#34;fmap&#34; with two parameters, a function to add one to integers and a list of integers. This can compound confusion when functor is thought of as a noun, because, what is fmap? Maybe it&#39;s a part of &#34;functor&#34;? In OO languages, functions do not have any sort of interface resolution on them.\n   that is, a method call on a list. In fact it isn&#39;t even particularly relevant at this point that &#34;fmap&#34; participates in an interface, because this is all statically-resolvable at compile time, just as it would be in many other languages. Laid out this way, an OO programmer has no problem imagining that resolving &#34;fmap&#34; may involve looking at the definition of the list itself.\n This is not how Haskell resolves names. It isn&#39;t an object-oriented name. But if you don&#39;t want to learn Haskell and merely want to learn about what all this &#34;monad&#34; and &#34;functor&#34; hype is, this is a  better metaphor for what Haskell is doing than thinking of  fmap as some sort of weird magical function. It&#39;s  closer to a method name resolving to an &#34;fmap&#34; implementation on a particular data structure. (Which, again, isn&#39;t  quite what&#39;s going on; it&#39;s just close enough for now.)\n   class Functor f where fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b\n This just says, if you have a way of taking an  a and producing a  b, and you have a source of  as, you can have a source of  bs.\n  This is the  full definition. There is no additional hidden machinery that Haskell is somehow automatically invoking when you &#34;use a Functor&#34;. Like many OO languages, there is no additional conversion or weird stuff wrapped around the resolved method. Just like OO resolving an overridden method (with no automatic conversions),  all the magic is in picking the correct implementation; once resolved the language is not doing anything else.\n What makes a data structure &#34;functorish&#34;? It is having a sensible implementation of fmap, whatever that may be on the data structure. If it has a sensible implementation, we can give it, that makes it a Functor, not the other way around. Theoretically this is how it ought to work in all languages with a concept of an interface of some sort, but sometimes the paperwork can get in the way and make it feel like it&#39;s the other way around, that something isn&#39;t an Iteratable until I deliberately make it one. But I think it&#39;s a more mature programming view to think of a data structure as always having a set of possible sensible implementations for a given interface, possibly empty or more than one, and you simply choose whether or not to explain it to the language. You usually aren&#39;t &#34;creating&#34; these implementations. At least for these simpler, more mathematical types of interfaces.\n  The functor definition above has  f a, which is Haskell notation for &#34;a type  f parameterized by  a&#34;. That&#39;s abstract with type variables, but easy in examples;  List Int is a &#34;List&#34; parameterized by &#34;Int&#34;, meaning it can hold Ints.\n While in full Haskell this can get more complicated, for the simple types I&#39;m using in this post you can do the match visually. To match  f a to  List Int, we set  f = List and  a = Int.\n Unfortunately, two of Haskell&#39;s most important types get special-cased and visually matching them is hard. Rather than  List Int, Haskell uses  [Int], which is confusing at the worst possible time for a novice.\n Fortunately, we can write this as  [] Int. It is already valid Haskell syntax. Then we can visually match:  f = [] and  a = Int. I don&#39;t write a lot of Haskell code nowadays but I&#39;ve been adopting that as how I represent lists everywhere in my types, because I don&#39;t think the special case is very useful.\n The other confusing type is the function type  a -&gt; b. For didactic purposes, it is better spelled  (-&gt;) a b. Again, legal Haskell syntax today, though you unfortunately need the parentheses. In this case, for the functor implementation on  (-&gt;),  f = (-&gt;) a and the remainder is  b. That&#39;s still a bit abstract, so let&#39;s concretize it by observing that you can convert the  output of both a  (-&gt;) String Int and a  (-&gt;) Int Int if you have some function  (-&gt;) Int String, because what matters is that the output of the function you are &#34;functionableing&#34; matches the input of the function you are applying to it, which is  Int in this case.\n I do  not use this in my code, because it mangles type signatures something fierce to do this everywhere. Still, it is important to bear in mind what it really means.\n In this case, the  f in the pattern matches &#34;the front piece&#34; instead of just the first element. If you do not intend to program in Haskell, just take my word for it that this is a legal match and let this wash over you; if you do intend to program in Haskell you&#39;ll find this won&#39;t take much to understand. Either way it&#39;s not terribly important for understanding what the monad interface is so I will be moving merrily along now.\n   A data structure is monadish when you have some source of  a, and a way of taking an  a and turning it into the same sort of source of  b, and turning that all into the same sort of source of  b. As with &#34;functor&#34; I am using the word &#34;source&#34; as the closest English word I can think of for the maximally generic idea of a type; you have a list of ints, or a function that yields an int, or a way of getting an int from user input, etc.\n class Monad m where (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b\n English is really tripping over itself here, but between the English description and the definition I hope the basic idea comes across. It probably also doesn&#39;t help that we have a function literally called  &gt;&gt;=, which is hard to pronounce. It&#39;s pronounced &#34;bind&#34;, which is only slightly more helpful in that that still fails to evoke any useful imagery. Let&#39;s take a specific example:\n  On its own, that&#39;s not a confusing function. In this particular case, there aren&#39;t that many possible sensible implementations. Clearly, we&#39;re going to iterate along the list of ints, pass them one by one to the thing that produces a list of strings, and the concatenate all those results together into the final list. (We have to do that, because the final result can&#39;t be a  List (List String); that&#39;s a separate type.)\n   That&#39;s all Monad is. It is an implementation of some &#34;method&#34; that conforms to that interface specification.\n Understanding this is not what people mean by &#34;understanding monad&#34;. This is the &#34;what&#34; of the monad interface, but not the &#34;why&#34;. But I think it is a step often glossed over too quickly in other works (if not at times outright skipped), so let&#39;s stay here and chew on that &#34;what&#34; for a bit.\n Once again, I want to emphasize that just like in OO languages and just like fmap, there is no special magic that Haskell invokes because &#34;it&#39;s a monad&#34;. All Haskell does is look up the interface&#39;s implementation and pass the arguments in. There is &#34;do notation&#34; but that is  only a syntax-sugar respelling of this function call; it still does no further manipulation of arguments, no coercions, no modification of input, no modification of output, nothing. Since this article is about understanding &#34;monad&#34; without going deeply into Haskell-specific details, I&#39;m going to ignore it because it&#39;s just syntax sugar.\n Bind is simply a function that takes some wrapped type, a function that takes the inner value and returns a wrapped value, and a final wrapped value of that type.\n  Again, no mystery to this implementation. It takes something that may have an Int or not, converts it to a string, and then returns something that is either a String or nothing.\n  Obviously, you don&#39;t know what Blorp does. I named it and I don&#39;t even know what it does. But you can see this would be an implementation of &#34;bind&#34; for Blorp, on particular types  Int and  String.\n That&#39;s all Monad is. Just as there is no magic around the Iterator&#39;s  Next method, just as there is no magic around functors,this is all the  what of a Monad is. In fact, it literally  can&#39;t be more complicated, because this is all an interface  is. All an interface can do is name a particular method. Nothing else happens. If you find your current conception of monad does not match that and it is insisting there&#39;s a big ball o&#39; mystery here, throw it out. It is nothing more than declaring a particular function as the implementation of this interface and the subsequent resolution machinery when you use it. Nothing. More.\n No, I do not mean this in a &#34;this hard concept is really easy if you look at right&#34;. I do not mean it as an attempt to simplify some explanation at all, because this isn&#39;t a simplified explanation. This  is what a monadic implementation is. It&#39;s not a simplification at all. It&#39;s a completely accurate description. It is no more and no less than a specification of an implementation for the particular interface. It is the same as Iterator and Functor and Stringable and all the other well-known interfaces many languages have.\n I have belabored this point in text mostly in the hopes that you&#39;ll slow down and process this before continuing on. A lot of people have really built this particular interface up in their head as something fundamentally mysterious. But this is all the  what of monad is.\n Is it a burrito? Is it a space suit? Is it some other bizarre metaphor? No. You don&#39;t need a bizarre metaphor to understand this part. In fact you rather need a  lack of bizarre metaphors, because they mythologize\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 08:44:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6559\u7a0b,\u51fd\u6570,monads", "title": "\u51ed\u501f\u8bfb\u8fc7\u592a\u591a\u201c\u6559\u7a0b\u201d\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u548cMonads ", "title_en": "Functors and Monads for People Who Have Read Too Many \u201cTutorials\u201d", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2958", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6559\u7a0b", "\u51fd\u6570", "monads"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d796b1935a1b242e1061509cf6d6fc78.jpg", "infoid": 1068358, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b63\u5982\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u5b66\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u6295\u8d44\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u73b0\u5728\uff08\u6839\u636e\u4e00\u4efd\u8bc1\u5238\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7533\u8bf7\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u68074.25\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u91d1\u3002\u5b83\u6709 -

It has \u2014 like a  growing number of other U.S. firms \u2014 also opened a new office in Berlin, headed by Max Mayer, a former investor with Global Founders Capital.\n We talked a bit about Activant\u2019s growing interest in Europe and what underlies it. We also talked about the velocity of deal-making right now and what Sarracino makes of one of the hottest trends of the year: the many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited lightly for length.\n   SS: A long time. We\u2019d invested in Hybris [an e-commerce company that was  acquired by SAP in 2013 for $1.5 billion]. We\u2019re also investors in NewMarket [a six-year-old, Berlin- and Boston-based SaaS company that was founded by serial entrepreneur  Stephan Schambach, who also founded Demandware].\n We go back and forth to London all the time; it\u2019s easy from the East Coast. But the continent is a different story. You really need to have a presence on the ground there.\n   SS: There was always a lot of technical talent there \u2014 I think there are two times the number of STEM graduates in Europe as in the U.S. The challenge before was that the venture community was smaller \u2014 it takes a vibrant early-stage community to create later-stage opportunities. Europe was also missing middle management. In L.A. or New York or Boston, you can pull strong SVPs or even C-level execs out of Facebook and Amazon, but there wasn\u2019t the same level of big companies there, and that has changed. They\u2019re all [in Europe] now. So you\u2019ve now got the technical talent, [sufficient] venture [dollars] and management.\n TC: Are there other advantages? Are valuations any better in Europe or is Tiger Global  driving up the numbers there, too?\n SS: For the best companies, you don\u2019t see much difference in valuation across continent. But the opportunity in Europe is attractive in the middle stage. Seed and A is pretty well covered, but B,C,D, and E is a very different game.\n Another amazing thing about Europe is that while you do have to spend a little more on marketing, sales, and product because you have to be multi-lingual, you have to deal with different tax jurisdictions, you have to sell differently in different countries, European startups as a result are purpose-built to go global much faster versus U.S. companies. [In the U.S.], you have one giant market and you might pop into the UK and Canada, but it\u2019s a very different proposition to go global.\n TC: Do the European companies you talk with feel the need to establish a presence in the U.S. as soon as possible, or has that changed, too?\n SS:\u00a0 In some areas, for example, where cloud adoption is behind in Europe versus the U.S., you can get hypergrowth in Europe. So it\u2019s not a requirement or prerequisite to expand into the U.S. But, of course, it\u2019s on the roadmap for anyone in the tech business.\n TC: How do you think about companies that could conceivably become rivals with your U.S. investments down the road?\n SS: We\u2019re careful about investing in the same company but in different geographies because our belief is that they can compete globally, so we try and pick the global winner. If it\u2019s a micro geo \u2014 let\u2019s say it\u2019s a company that sells SMB infrastructure software in Germany and won\u2019t get to the US, we wouldn\u2019t have trouble backing [a similar company in the U.S.], but that\u2019s something you have to pay close attention to, because we are on the board and we are active.\n Our funds are fairly concentrated. In our third fund, we only have six assets. With this new fund, we\u2019ll have 10 to 12 partnerships at most. So it\u2019s a little easier to manage.\n  TC: How can anyone invest in a market that\u2019s moving this fast? We reporters see a lot of deals and they look so much alike at this point that it\u2019s dizzying. It must be exponentially worse for you.\n SS: Things are moving fast and they\u2019re expensive. Tiger and bigger firms have shifted the market. But there are still great opportunities in the mid-stages. Our overall philosophy is that, first, you want to find the startup that\u2019s doing something different or doing something that no one has done in a long time. You also have to distinguish between a feature and a platform. Can this startup build out a real platform and acquire different types of customers? Third, you\u2019ve got to know these sectors much better now than ever before, because, to your point, there are 15 companies doing the same thing these days, and to have that level of conviction, you have to meet with all 15 and pick what you think is the winning horse based on where the market is going, the quality of the team, and the quality of the product they can build.\n In some ways it\u2019s harder to differentiate, and there are a few ways to react to that. The way we react is to retrench to our core sectors that we know well and say no to a lot of stuff that seems really amazing but we\u2019re just not going to get up to speed fast enough given the velocity of the market.\n TC: How do you determine whether a startup is working on a feature versus a platform?\n SS: It\u2019s a real issue because there are a lot of great feature companies that can get to some scale pretty fast \u2014 $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million in revenue. But making that next step is hard. Companies with real network effects \u2014 meaning that every customer they add, there\u2019s some benefit to the other customers \u2014 [can be] any sort of of two-sided marketplace, [it can be] embedded payments, [but there has to be] some other level of \u2018value add\u2019 besides selling simple software.\n That\u2019s also seeing more companies charging transactionally versus [a flat subscription rate]. I think that\u2019s going to be a big trend over the next three years \u2014 this move away from SaaS to charging along the lines of what the customers cares about. When you charge the way the customer views their revenue, the product has to be very good and very differentiated.\n  TC: You\u2019ve talked with me before about funding companies that help SMBs avoid getting hollowed out by Amazon. Just wondering what you make of these many roll-ups of third-party sellers on Amazon we\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and Europe and suddenly in Asia, too.\n SS: Oh, gosh. So they\u2019re basically finding really neat products, buying them for cheap multiples of EBITDA, and then driving better advertising, visibility, and reviews on Amazon to get more buyers driving up EBITDA. It\u2019s a brilliant play, but I\u2019ve had my face ripped off a few times, and one [instance owed to there being] a single point of failure, so as Amazon shifts things, I think that introduces risk.\n There are some really interesting assets out there. It\u2019s just not what we do. I also think there was some Covid bump, because people were at home and not spending money on travel, so you saw spending shift away from services and experiences and into goods and products and I think that\u2019s going to shift back quickly to experiences. So we\u2019ll see what happens post COVID with some of these, but it\u2019s going to be get the same kind of overarching growth that drove some of the underlying products. There\u2019s\u00a0 also a question about how much technology they\u2019re really applying versus, is it more of a deal business. That\u2019s unclear, but, I mean, some of them have raised like half a billion dollars so they got it, they\u2019re doing something right.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 08:07:35", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "As part of SiFive\u2019s announcements today, along with enabling SiFive IP on Intel\u2019s Foundry Service offerings, Intel will be creating its own RISC-V development platform using its 7nm process technology. This platform, called Horse Creek, will feature several of SiFive\u2019s new Performance P550 cores also being announced today, and will be paired with Intel\u2019s DDR and PCIe IP technology.\n    On first reading into the press release, it isn\u2019t 100% clear that Intel\u2019s commentary discusses a platform with P550 as a host or as an add-in device: to quote Intel, \u2018 We are pleased to be a lead development partner with SiFive\u00a0to showcase to mutual customers the impressive performance\u00a0of their P550 on our\u00a07nm\u00a0Horse Creek platform\u2019. Intel historically typically  keeps its Creek family names, such as Boulder Creek, Cherry Creek, or Timber Creek, for socketed platforms - not for all-in-one embedded development platforms. Not only that, the wording makes it sound like we should consider a RISC-V core as an assistant core managing another part of a system.\n  However it would appear that Intel intends to make this a fully-featured development system, along similar lines to SiFive\u2019s own  HiFive Unmatched platform launched early this year. What makes this special is that Intel is committing to developing the SoC on its own 7nm process node, which provides a \u2018simpler\u2019 vehicle for Intel to test and ramp up its 7nm technology. This can be coupled with increasing interest in RISC-V development, and deploying a platform though Intel\u2019s supply chain and distribution might have a far reach to put these in the hands of upcoming developers.\n  The new SiFive Performance P550 core at the heart of Horse Creek is SiFive\u2019s highest performance processor to date, with the company quoting a SPEC2006int of 8.65 per GHz. It is a Linux-capable core, with full support for the RISC-V vector extension v1.0rc. It has a 13-stage triple-issue out-of-order microarchitecture with a private 32KB+32KB L1 cache and a private L2 cache (per core) The design supports four cores in a single cluster that can be paired up to 4 MB of shared L3.\n    The time scale for this platform coming to market is quite interesting. Despite Intel recently committed to bringing its 7nm to market in 2023 with  the compute tile for its Meteor Lake processor as its first 7nm product, we\u2019re being told that Horse Creek silicon will be ready in 2022, which would make Horse Creek its first 7nm product. For what it is worth, it\u2019s unlikely that the Intel RISC-V solution is tile-based, but it might be easy enough to bring a small RISC-V chip development platform to market around then. The chip is likely to be small, so that might work in favor of its costs as well. A question does remain as to whether Intel\u2019s involvement here is purely in the hardware, or whether there will be an Intel-based software stack to go along with it.\n  POST A COMMENT      Considering the comparison point is Cortex-A75, this still puts top-end RV apps cores a long way behind top-end ARM licensables. But they certainly seem to be improving. Also, Doc Ian, it looks like in the last paragraph you refer to Horse Creek as Horse Ridge, which is a very different product (quantum control circuit.) I assume this is just a typo, since it&#39;s sorta baffling otherwise.\n  Reply\n      Doesn&#39;t help that some will now say that Intel&#39;s future is indeed &#34;up the creek (s)&#34;.   Reply\n  Although the RV &#34;performance core&#34; appears to be much closer to ARM&#39;s LITTLE cores in size/area/transistor count. And, unlike them, it&#39;s OOO, something ARM has been resistant to implementing even in their newest designs.   Reply\n  \u201cThe new SiFive Performance P550 core at the heart of Horse Creek is SiFive\u2019s highest performance processor to date, with the company quoting a SPEC2006int of 8.65 per GHz.\u201d How does this compare against other common CPU designs? I think it would be useful to have that info in the article.   Reply\n  Sifive is saying the comparison point is the Cortex-A75. That makes it fairly fast by the standard of apps processors as a whole, but far behind current ARM licensable IP or mainstream cores from Intel, AMD, or Apple.  Reply\n  Four years and one month behind A75 announcement, to be precise.  The U84 was announced 4.75 years after the A72. The U74 was announced 6 years after the A53.  So far, each generation of SiFive cores is about one less year behind ARM than the previous one.  Remembering that SiFive was founded after the A72 was announced.

A13 scores 19.85/GHz A14 scores 21.1/GHz R9 5950X scores 13.57/GHz i9-10900K scores 11.08/GHz  P550 is probably peak score/GHz, whereas all of these points are at the most extreme/least efficient point for the high-end products. The overall performance also matters when you factor in frequency, as cores won&#39;t scale linearly with core frequency as other parts of the SoC will be fixed.  Reply\n  I wonder if cloud vendors would be interested in a giant package stuffed full of these cores? Small, isolated VMs don&#39;t need tons of core-cluster to core-cluster communication.  I understand this design probably can&#39;t do that... and if there was interest, I suppose Altera or someone would&#39;ve come out with a design based on smaller ARM cores.

Few \u2014 very few, in fact \u2014 come out willing or even able to express complex ideas in ways appealing to non-academics. John Gray is one of those rare intellectuals.   \rProfessors tend to scoff at books written for more general audiences. Anything that becomes popular is taken as potentially not serious. But the truth is, most professors simply cannot write, talk, and perhaps even think in a manner which can engage non-academics. Having gone through years of rigorous, specialized training, scholars find it hard to communicate their insights to anyone outside their narrow fields. Gray does not.  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life is broadly appealing. Even more impressive, it has readers seriously consider radical ideas.   \rIt is difficult to speak about the myth of human progress, the navel-gazing silliness of autonomy and reason, the pompous attitude of the righteous, and the associated paradoxical nature of morality, accepting that neither love nor death are really such a big deal and \u2014 this is the real point of the book \u2014 the meaninglessness of the meaning of life. Gray does so without strong arguments, logical deductions, or other conventional philosophical tools. Big-name philosophers are referenced, but mostly on the back of novels about cats. Intertwining stories and facts about cats with philosophy, Gray invites serious reflection without telling readers how to reason or what to think.   \rThe 111-page book is broken into six chapters. In the first one, \u201cCats and Philosophy,\u201d Gray plainly states: \u201cThe nature of cats, and what we can learn from it, is the subject of this book.\u201d Here, and in the second chapter, \u201cWhy Cats Do Not Struggle to Be Happy,\u201d Gray presents philosophy as an effect of restlessness: it is born as an attempt to calm the anxiety of living in a chaotic and unpredictable world. Happiness then becomes a project for the future, when we do not feel un-at-ease. Unfortunately, striving with a clear plan in mind only makes things worse. \u201cOur lives are shaped by chance and our emotions by the body. Much of human life \u2014 and much of philosophy \u2014 is an attempt to divert ourselves from this fact.\u201d For cats, on the other hand, happiness just might be their natural condition.   \rIn the next chapter, Gray revisits one of his more unique positions. Discussing \u201cFeline Ethics,\u201d Gray reminds readers that moral values, standards, and any way of thinking about what is good or bad, are historically and regionally relative and contingent. This is true not just of cultures or societies, but of individuals as well. \u201cWhen people talk of morality they do not know what it is they are talking about. At the same time they are unshakably certain in what they say. This may seem paradoxical. But it is not, since what they are doing is expressing their emotions.\u201d Borrowing heavily from Spinoza, Daoism ( Daodejing/Tao Te Ching), and Zen Buddhism, Gray eloquently dances through attacks on morality, rationalism, agency, and the self.   \rChapter four provides a soothing respite from serious philosophical discussions. Here, \u201cHuman vs Feline Love\u201d is discussed largely by way of summarizing novels about cats. It is difficult to say exactly what, if any, specific point Gray is trying to make. And this is not meant as a criticism. Like many great thinkers, Gray is simply inviting readers to reflect and consider certain perspectives. Chapter five, on \u201cTime, Death and the Feline Soul,\u201d is written in a similar manner. The overarching idea here is simply that cats seem to \u201caccept life as a gift,\u201d while humans anxiously toil over every aspect of life and often get caught up in endless speculation about death.   \rIn the final chapter, \u201cCats and the Meaning of Life,\u201d Gray challenges that \u201cthe good life for each of us is not chosen but found.\u201d We are asked to consider the Daoist idea that \u201cwe must follow the way within us.\u201d Should we do that, our lives will be \u201cricher than any idea of perfection.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe good life is not a life you might have led or may yet lead, but the life you already have. Here, cats can be our teachers, for they do not miss the lives they have not lived.\u201d   \rGray eventually gives us \u201cTen Feline Hints on How to Live Well.\u201d They are concise and eloquent lessons we might learn from thinking about a \u201cfeline philosophy,\u201d or even from an honest reflection on life. The last sentence well summarizes the book in both content and style: \u201cThe meaning of life is a touch, a scent, which comes by chance and is gone before you know it.\u201d   \rReaders might be surprised that in the 10 lessons we never hear about \u201cplay.\u201d Upon further intellectual consideration, this becomes even more puzzling. The English intellectual is extremely fond of Daoism and Zen Buddhism; he titled his book  Straw Dogs (2002) after the fifth chapter of the  Daodejing. But the second cardinal Daoist text, and the major facilitator of the philosophical interchange between Daoism and Buddhism that produced Zen, the  Zhuangzi ( Chuang-Tzu), is conspicuously absent in  Feline Philosophy. This Daoist classic is not only full of jokes, conversations between animals, and advice from trees \u2014 it introduces \u201cplay\u201d as a philosophical approach and advocates it as a possible approach to life. Readers may seriously wonder why Gray did not talk about play in  Feline Philosophy, and what he thinks of the  Zhuangzi.   \rRelatedly, one great feline novel not mentioned in Gray\u2019s book is  I Am a Cat\u00a0by S\u014dseki Natsume (1867\u20131916). Natsume\u2019s story is playfully written from a cat\u2019s perspective. In more than a few places, the cat, or people around it, dives into prolonged digs against Western theories of progress, reason, and positivism \u2014 an obvious overlap with Gray\u2019s own predilections. More important than the philosophical digressions, however, is the playful element of  I Am a Cat. Unsurprisingly, much of  I Am a Cat, and Natsume\u2019s work in general, draws heavily on the  Zhuangzi.   \rSome reviewers of  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life have summarized John Gray as advocating a coupling of feline indifference with Daoist contemplation. This assessment is more of a review of reviews than of the book itself. The real joy of  Feline Philosophy comes from the very experience of reading it. The book does not attempt to \u201cprove\u201d anything. Gray has survived the wringer and now expertly plays with his philosophical reflections. Like the  Daodejing, the Daoist classic Gray constantly references, readers miss the point if they search  Feline Philosophy for evaluative judgments, truths, or even arguments. The  Daodejing is (most likely) a record of sayings written, rewritten, edited, and reedited for centuries. For over two millennia, everyone from rulers, scholars, and Daoist priests to farmers and hermits read the text in a similar manner. They repeated the short sayings and reflected on their lives. What was useful from the  Daodejing they used, what wasn\u2019t they ignored. And that was that.   \rPerhaps we can, or even should, do something similar with our philosophical discussions today. Gray undoubtedly has his own philosophical perspective. But he has certainly learned from cats, and his reflections are honest and humble. In a world where hubris of all kinds fuels objectively difficult situations, it might not be a bad idea to be a little less black and white. Indeed, it might be even better if we added a bit of playfulness.       Paul J. D\u2019Ambrosio is associate professor of Chinese philosophy at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.

", "note_en": "When the coronavirus shut down New York last spring, many residents came to rely on a colossal building they had never heard of: JFK8, Amazon\u2019s only fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city.\n What happened inside shows how Jeff Bezos created the workplace of the future and pulled off the impossible during the pandemic \u2014 but also reveals what\u2019s standing in the way of his promise to do better by his employees.\n Each year, hundreds of thousands of workers churn through a vast mechanism that hires and monitors, disciplines and fires. Amid the pandemic, the already strained system lurched.\n   Last September, Ann Castillo saw an email from Amazon that made no sense. Her husband had worked for the company for five years, most recently at the supersize warehouse on Staten Island that served as the retailer\u2019s critical pipeline to New York City. Now it wanted him back on the night shift.\n \u201cWe notified your manager and H.R. about your return to work on Oct. 1, 2020,\u201d the message said.\n Ms. Castillo was incredulous. While working mandatory overtime in the spring, her 42-year-old husband, Alberto, had been among the first wave of employees at the site to test positive for the coronavirus. Ravaged by fevers and infections, he suffered extensive brain damage. On tests of responsiveness, Ms. Castillo said, \u201chis score was almost nothing.\u201d\n  For months, Ms. Castillo, a polite, get-it-done physical therapist, had been alerting the company that her husband, who had been proud to work for the retail giant, was severely ill. The responses were disjointed and confusing. Emails and calls to Amazon\u2019s automated systems often dead-ended. The company\u2019s benefits were generous, but she had been left panicking as disability payments mysteriously halted. She managed to speak to several human resources workers, one of whom reinstated the payments, but after that, the dialogue mostly reverted to phone trees, auto-replies and voice mail messages on her husband\u2019s phone asking if he was coming back.\n The return-to-work summons deepened her suspicion that Amazon didn\u2019t fully register his situation. \u201cHaven\u2019t they kept track of what happened to him?\u201d she said. She wanted to ask the company: \u201cAre your workers disposable? Can you just replace them?\u201d\n Mr. Castillo\u2019s workplace, the only Amazon fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city, was achieving the impossible during the pandemic. With New York\u2019s classic industries suffering mass collapse, the warehouse, called JFK8, absorbed hotel workers, actors, bartenders and dancers, paying nearly $18 an hour. Driven by a new sense of mission to serve customers afraid to shop in person, JFK8 helped Amazon smash shipping records, reach stratospheric sales and book the equivalent of the previous three years\u2019 profits rolled into one.\n That success, speed and agility were possible because Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, had pioneered new ways of mass-managing people through technology, relying on a maze of systems that minimized human contact to grow unconstrained.\n But the company was faltering in ways outsiders could not see, according to a New York Times examination of JFK8 over the last year.\n In contrast to its precise, sophisticated processing of packages, Amazon\u2019s model for managing people \u2014 heavily reliant on metrics, apps and chatbots \u2014 was uneven and strained even before the coronavirus arrived, with employees often having to act as their own caseworkers, interviews and records show. Amid the pandemic, Amazon\u2019s system burned through workers, resulted in inadvertent firings and stalled benefits, and impeded communication, casting a shadow over a business success story for the ages.\n Amazon took steps unprecedented at the company to offer leniency, but then at times contradicted or ended them. Workers like Mr. Castillo at JFK8 were told to take as much unpaid time off as they needed, then hit with mandatory overtime. When Amazon offered employees flexible personal leaves, the system handling them jammed, issuing a blizzard of job-abandonment notices to workers and sending staff scrambling to save them, according to human resources and warehouse employees.\n  After absences initially soared and disrupted shipping, Amazon left employees mostly in the dark about the toll of the virus. The company did not tell workers at JFK8 or other warehouses the number of cases, causing them to worry whether notifications about \u201cindividuals\u201d testing positive meant two or 22. While Amazon said publicly that it was disclosing confirmed cases to health officials, New York City records show no reported cases until November. The company and city officials dispute what happened.\n Amazon continued to track every minute of most warehouse workers\u2019 shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused \u2014 the kind of monitoring that  spurred a failed unionization drive led by frustrated Black employees at an Alabama warehouse this spring. If productivity flagged, Amazon\u2019s computers assumed the worker was to blame. Early in the pandemic, the online retailer paused its firing of employees for low output, but that change was not announced clearly at JFK8, so some workers still feared that moving too slowly would cost them their livelihoods.\n \u201cIt is very important that area managers understand that associates are more than just numbers,\u201d an employee wrote on JFK8\u2019s internal feedback board last fall, adding: \u201cWe are human beings. We are not tools used to make their daily/weekly goals and rates.\u201d\n The company touted breathtaking job-creation numbers: From July to October 2020 alone, it scooped up 350,000 new workers, more than the population of St. Louis. Many recruits \u2014 hired through a computer screening, with little conversation or vetting \u2014 lasted just days or weeks.\n Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year. That rate,  almost double that of the retail and logistics industries, has made some executives worry about running out of workers across America.\n In documenting the untold story of how the pandemic exposed the power and peril of Amazon\u2019s employment system, reporters interviewed nearly 200 current and former employees, from new hires at the JFK8 bus stop to back-office workers overseas to managers on Staten Island and in Seattle. The Times also reviewed company documents, legal filings and government records, as well as posts from warehouse feedback boards that served as a real-time ticker of worker concerns.\n  This April, Mr. Bezos said he was proud of the company\u2019s work culture, the \u201cachievable\u201d productivity goals, the pay and benefits. In interviews, the head of human resources for warehouses and the general manager of JFK8 said that the company prioritized employee welfare, noted that it had expanded its H.R. staff and cited internal surveys showing high worker satisfaction. Some managers from JFK8 and beyond described building deep relationships with their teams.\n Amazon acknowledged some issues with inadvertent firings, loss of benefits, job abandonment notices and leaves, but declined to disclose how many people were affected. Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman, suggested that those problems and some others chronicled in this article were outliers.\n Ofori Agboka, the H.R. leader, noted that social distancing and masking had made it harder to engage employees in personal ways during the pandemic. Still, he said, \u201c98 percent of everything\u2019s going great \u2014 people are having the right experiences,\u201d getting the help they need when they want it.\n But several former executives who helped design Amazon\u2019s systems, and still call themselves admirers of the company, said the high turnover, pressure over productivity and consequences of scaling up have become too critical to ignore. The company has not ambitiously addressed those issues, said Paul Stroup, who until recently led corporate teams devoted to understanding warehouse workers.\n \u201cAmazon can solve pretty much any problem it puts its mind behind,\u201d he said in an interview. The human resources division, though, had nowhere near the focus, rigor and investment of Amazon\u2019s logistical operations, where he had previously worked. \u201cIt felt like I was in a different company,\u201d he said.\n David Niekerk, a former Amazon vice president who built the warehouse human resources operations, said that some problems stemmed from ideas the company had developed when it was much smaller. Mr. Bezos did not want an entrenched work force, calling it \u201ca march to mediocrity,\u201d Mr. Niekerk recalled, and saw low-skilled jobs as relatively short-term. As Amazon rapidly grew, Mr. Niekerk said, its policies were harder to implement with fairness and care. \u201cIt is just a numbers game in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture gets lost.\u201d\n  Even Mr. Bezos, in his final lap as chief executive of the company he created, is now making startling concessions about the system he invented. In a recent letter to shareholders, he said the union effort showed that \u201cwe need a better vision for how we create value for employees \u2014 a vision for their success.\u201d\n \u201cWe have always wanted to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u201d he wrote. Now, he added, \u201cwe are going to be Earth\u2019s best employer and Earth\u2019s  safest place to work.\u201d\n Amazon is also  on pace to become the nation\u2019s largest private employer within a year or two, as it continues expanding. About a million people in the United States, most of them hourly workers, now rely on the company\u2019s wages and benefits. Many describe the job as rewarding. Adama Ndoye had supported her family on her JFK8 pay while attending college remotely. \u201cLights on, food, clothes, everything,\u201d she said. Dawn George, a chef, said she was grateful to JFK8 for taking her in after hotel kitchen jobs disappeared last spring. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work my socks off just for an hourly income,\u201d she said.\n Some admire Amazon\u2019s ambition. \u201cIt was like being a pitcher on a team that had a game every night,\u201d said Dan Cavagnaro, who started at JFK8 when it opened in 2018 and worked with Mr. Castillo.\n  But Mr. Cavagnaro was mistakenly fired in July while trying to return from leave, and could not reach anyone to help.\n \u201cPlease note the following,\u201d he wrote in his final, unanswered email plea. \u201cI WISH TO REMAIN EMPLOYED WITH AMAZON.\u201d\n   In late March 2020, Traci Weishalla walked the length of JFK8, forgoing the fluorescent vest that marked her as a manager. She wanted an unfiltered look at what she would soon be helping to oversee: a warehouse the size of 15 football fields, serving America\u2019s largest metropolis just as it was becoming the national epicenter of the pandemic.\n The noise, from conveyor belts whipping around packages, was like the roar of an oncoming subway train. Built to conquer the most lucrative market in the country, the facility ran almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n Ms. Weishalla had helped open the warehouse a year and a half earlier, and now \u2014 as homebound customers across the nation  clamored for thermometers, disinfectant and puzzles \u2014 she saw opportunity and purpose in her return as assistant general manager. For an organization that dealt in logistical miracles, the coronavirus was just another obstacle to overcome, she said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Ms. Weishalla, 38, explained later. \u201cWe work to figure out the impossible problems.\u201d\n  But Amazon\u2019s mighty system was lurching. Semi trucks sat at warehouses around the country, without enough workers to unload them. Customers discovered that items the company had deemed nonessential might take a month to arrive \u2014 an eternity for a business that had routinely delivered within two days.\n   To lure them back, Amazon offered a temporary $2-an-hour raise, double pay for overtime and, for the first time, unlimited unpaid time off. Executives thought that workers should be able to stay home without fear of being fired, and that with greater flexibility, some might still come in for part of a shift, according to two people familiar with the decision. (Like some other senior leaders in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.)\n  Across the country, almost a third of Amazon\u2019s 500,000 workers were staying home. Some new hires abandoned jobs before they even began, according to former recruiters. JFK8 \u201cwas like a ghost town,\u201d recalled Arthur Turner, a worker who remained.\n Even Alberto Castillo considered staying home. The numbers on the news were unfathomable: at least 20,000 New Yorkers already infected, city hospitals jammed, as many as 1.7 million deaths projected nationwide.\n But this was no time to go without his income: The Castillos, immigrants from the Philippines, yearned to buy a house. He worked nights, troubleshooting and training with gentle mastery, frequent jokes and \u201cStar Wars\u201d references, colleagues said, and he had just applied for a promotion.\n JFK8 was also giving contradictory instructions: Despite Amazon\u2019s promise of unpaid time off, workers were alerted that every department would be on mandatory overtime.\n When Mr. Castillo arrived on March 24, he heard the warehouse had its first positive case. He messaged his boss, who replied, \u201cYes, forgot to bring that up,\u201d and added that everyone who worked with the employee had been notified. Mr. Castillo called his wife to discuss whether to head home. They decided he would finish out his shift.\n    That morning, two workers drove in the opposite direction, beelined to JFK8\u2019s break room and told dozens of colleagues: The virus had breached the warehouse, Amazon could not be trusted to tell them the truth and the facility should be shut down.\n Derrick Palmer and Chris Smalls, Amazon teammates and best friends, weren\u2019t part of any formal effort. Their employer considered unionization a dire threat, and had even backed out of building a second headquarters in New York  in part over potential labor-organizing plans. A  retail workers\u2019 union had once boldly declared that JFK8 would become the first unionized Amazon warehouse in the country, but the effort had died.\n Both men had been at Amazon since 2015 and knew the company from the lowest rungs. Mr. Palmer, then 31, was observant and deliberate, so fit that he often headed to the gym after a 10-hour shift. After dropping out of community college, he worked in a string of warehouses, joined Amazon and was now a \u201cpicker\u201d at JFK8, pulling products off robotic shelves. He often produced top numbers on the software that tracked productivity, and had been selected to train others and help open a warehouse in Illinois.\n He also felt let down, believing that Amazon\u2019s towering success didn\u2019t accrue to workers like him. Employees felt managed largely by app, algorithm and strict but poorly explained rules, he said. When he met Ms. Weishalla at a 2019 session for workers to share feedback, he said, he requested more human interaction from management and told her he aspired to a job like hers. But he saw no changes. \u201cIf we go beyond the requirements, there\u2019s no reward,\u201d he said in an interview.\n  When Mr. Palmer last sought a promotion, in early 2020, he was among 382 people who applied for the position. Though he didn\u2019t know it, the odds were steep by design, an outgrowth of Mr. Bezos\u2019 management philosophies.\n Amazon intentionally limited upward mobility for hourly workers, said Mr. Niekerk, the former H.R. vice president who retired in 2016 after nearly 17 years at the company. Dave Clark, then head of operations, had shot down his proposal around 2014 to create more leadership roles for hourly employees, similar to noncommissioned officers in the military, he recalled.\n Instead, Mr. Clark, who is now chief executive of Amazon\u2019s consumer business, wanted to double down on hiring \u201cwicked smart\u201d frontline managers straight out of college, Mr. Niekerk said. By contrast, more than 75 percent of managers in Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores started as hourly employees. Following a pattern across Amazon, JFK8 promoted 220 people last year among its more than 5,000 employees, a rate that is less than half of Walmart\u2019s.\n Amazon\u2019s founder didn\u2019t want hourly workers to stick around for long, viewing \u201ca large, disgruntled\u201d work force as a threat, Mr. Niekerk recalled. Company data showed that most employees became less eager over time, he said, and Mr. Bezos believed that people were inherently lazy. \u201cWhat he would say is that our nature as humans is to expend as little energy as possible to get what we want or need.\u201d That conviction was  embedded throughout the business, from the ease of instant ordering to the pervasive use of data to get the most out of employees.\n So guaranteed wage increases stopped after three years, and Amazon provided incentives for low-skilled employees to leave. Every year, Mr. Palmer saw signs go up offering associates thousands of dollars to resign, and as he entered JFK8 each morning, he passed a classroom for free courses to train them in other fields.\n Mr. Agboka, the H.R. leader, said while the company offered training and careers at Amazon to those interested, it was proud to also provide people short-term employment for the \u201cseasons and periods of time\u201d they need.\n  As the virus arrived at JFK8, Mr. Palmer worried about how Amazon would protect and communicate with workers. Notification about the warehouse\u2019s first positive case had been uneven. A colleague working near Mr. Smalls had appeared sick, her eyes bloodshot as she struggled through her shift.\n The two men saw only one solution: for JFK8 to pause, clean and reassess, as an Amazon facility in Queens had briefly done. Unpaid leave wasn\u2019t enough, they said \u2014 a company run by the richest man on earth shouldn\u2019t force workers to choose between safety and a paycheck.\n    \u201cAre you guys actually just picking essential items?\u201d one asked, referring to Amazon\u2019s early-pandemic efforts to ship only necessary merchandise.\n  Nearly all the workers in the group were Black, like Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls, or Latino. So were more than 60 percent of associates at JFK8, according to internal Amazon records from 2019. Management, the documents show, was more than 70 percent white or Asian. Black associates at JFK8 were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired \u2014 whether for productivity, misconduct, or not showing up for work \u2014 than their white peers, the records show.

Mr. Palmer carried a sign that read, \u201cTreat your workers like your customers.\u201d\n In Seattle, executives still grappling with cratering attendance sought to minimize the protest but instead drew more  attention to it. Amazon fired Mr. Smalls, saying his demonstration had violated a quarantine order based on his contact with the sick co-worker.

The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers\u2019 data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information.\u201d\n Western Digital\u2019s  brief advisory includes  a link to an entry in the National Vulnerability Database for CVE-2018-18472. The NVD writeup says Western Digital WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have a root Remote Command Execution bug.\n \u201cIt can be triggered by anyone who knows the IP address of the affected device, as exploited in the wild in June 2021 for factory reset commands,\u201d NVD wrote.\n Examine the CVE attached to this flaw and you\u2019ll notice it was issued in 2018. The  NVD\u2019s advisory credits VPN reviewer  Wizcase.com with reporting the bug to Western Digital three years ago, back in June 2018.\n In some ways, it\u2019s remarkable that it took this long for vulnerable MyBook devices to be attacked: The 2018 Wizcase writeup on the flaw includes proof-of-concept code that lets anyone run commands on the devices as the all-powerful \u201croot\u201d user.\n Western Digital\u2019s response at the time was that the affected devices were no longer supported and that customers should avoid connecting them to the Internet. That response also suggested this bug has been present in its devices for at least a decade.\n \u201cThe vulnerability report CVE-2018-18472 affects My Book Live devices originally introduced to the market between 2010 and 2012,\u201d reads a reply from Western Digital that Wizcase  posted to its blog. \u201cThese products have been discontinued since 2014 and are no longer covered under our device software support lifecycle. We encourage users who wish to continue operating these legacy products to configure their firewall to prevent remote access to these devices, and to take measures to ensure that only trusted devices on the local network have access to the device.\u201d\n  Wizcase said the flaw it found in MyBook devices also may be present in certain models of  WD MyCloud network attached storage (NAS) devices, although Western Digital\u2019s advisory makes no mention of its MyCloud line being affected.\n The vulnerable MyBook devices are popular among home users and small businesses because they\u2019re relatively feature-rich and inexpensive, and can be upgraded with additional storage quite easily. But these products also make it simple for users to access their files remotely over the Internet using a mobile app.\n I\u2019m guessing it is primarily users who\u2019ve configured their MyBooks to be remotely accessible who are experiencing these unfortunate drive wipes. Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from ethernet access.\n If you\u2019d still like to keep your MyBook connected to your local network (at least until you can find a suitable backup for your backups), please make double sure remote access is not enabled in your device settings (see screenshot above).\n       \u201cNo longer supported\u201d shouldn\u2019t mean \u201cSay goodbye to your data!\u2019\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Top hints: \u201cdefault password \u2018admin,\u2019 \u201d followed by \u201cfinal firmware update in 2015,\u201d and \u201cCVE-2018\u2026\u201d It\u2019s almost as though individuals are copying the cybersecurity practices of corporations!\n    I\u2019m not so sure\u2026WD did state that the device should not be connected to the Internet (but probably not in anything sent to people they knew had bought the device). The vulnerability was identified 3 years after they stopped producing it, and at this point it has been 6 years since the last one was produced.\n I\u2019m with Brian\u2026the surprising thing is that it took three years after the vulnerability with POC was exploited (at least on any scale).\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Not victim shaming, but what the heck are you doing exposing a personal hard drive to the web in the first place?\n  I\u2019m a tech from way back and I also have external hard drives plugged up to my computer, two of them WD brand, but I never made use of the online cloud service provided by WD. In the world before cloud computing was available, I copied everything to two separate hard drives and then handed one to my father and another one to my grandmother and they stored them in the back of some closets in their own homes for years. My logic at the time was this: if there\u2019s ever a fire or some other kind of disaster, at least my data is safe in two different backup locations.\n  The first paragraph\u2019s use of \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d is either confusing (there\u2019s a 3-year old CVE and POC) or tautological (everything we know is \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d). Admittedly a nit, but one an article skimmer might think excuses WD somewhat.\n  &gt; Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from **ethernet** access.\n Was this supposed to be **internet** access? Not nitpicking here, just wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think \u201coh it\u2019s ok mine\u2019s on WiFi not Ethernet\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:59:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "Researchers have dropped a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on Twitter for a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The move comes as reports surface of in-the-wild exploitation of the bug.\n Researchers at Positive Technologies published the PoC for the bug (CVE-2020-3580) on Thursday. One of the researchers there, Mikhail Klyuchnikov, noted that there were a heap of researchers now chasing after an exploit for the bug, which he termed \u201clow-hanging\u201d fruit.\n   The hunt for low hanging CVE-2020-3580 by  @ptswarm has begun. A lot of submissions/duplicates are waiting for  @Bugcrowd and  @Hacker0x01  #bugbounty\n  Meanwhile, Tenable researchers published an alert about the PoC, noting that it has started to see cyberattacks using the vulnerability on targets in the wild.\n \u201cTenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild,\u201d according to its  Thursday alert. \u201cWith this new information, Tenable recommends that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580.\u201d\n And indeed, the PT PoC tweet was met with plenty of \u201cOoh thanks\u201d and \u201cthank you so much\u201d responses, presumably from would-be hackers.\n   Meanwhile, researchers at WebSec noted that the bug could be exploited for more than XSS:\n You could have gotten 2 CVE numbers for this, as this is not just XSS but also CSRF.\n  \u201cResearchers often develop PoCs before reporting a vulnerability to a developer and publishing them allows other researchers to both check their work and potentially dig further and discover other issues,\u201d Claire Tills, senior research engineer at Tenable, told Threatpost. \u201cPoCs can also be used by defenders to develop detections for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, giving that valuable information to defenders means it can also end up in the hands of attackers.\u201d\n Given that a patch has been available for this vulnerability for several months, organizations are able to protect themselves which isn\u2019t the case with 0-day disclosures, she pointed out. \u201cHowever, unpatched vulnerabilities continue to haunt many organizations,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cThe public availability of a PoC is another stark reminder that effective patching is a vital step for organizations to protect themselves.\u201d\n  The Cisco ASA is a  cybersecurity perimeter-defense appliance that combines firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities, all meant to stop threats from making it onto corporate networks. A compromise of the device is akin to unlocking the front door of the castle for storming cyberattackers.\n XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites; any visitors to the compromised websites are thus subject to drive-by attacks.\n Successful exploitation in this case means that unauthenticated, remote attackers could \u201cexecute arbitrary code within the [ASA] interface and access sensitive, browser-based information,\u201d Tenable added.\n Once in, they could modify the device\u2019s configuration, according to Leo Pate, an application security consultant at nVisium.\n However, the target would need to be logged into the ASA for the attackers to see any joy. \u201cWhile this sounds dangerous, exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrative user to login and navigate to the webpage where the attacker uploaded the malicious code,\u201d he added.\n As Tenable researchers said: \u201cAn attacker would need to convince \u2018a user of the interface\u2019 to click on a specially crafted link.\u201d This can be accomplished via a spear-phishing email campaign targeting probable ASA users using malicious links, or via watering-hole attacks.\n \u201cThe attack vector to get this in the hands of the right people is complex requiring a firewall administrator to be duped into clicking a cleverly crafted link,\u201d Andrew Barratt, managing principal for solutions and investigations at Coalfire, told Threatpost. \u201cFirewall administrators will need to ensure they\u2019re not accessing links to the ASA interface that appear to originate from outside.\u201d\n  Thanks to the sheer size of its footprint (including inside Fortune 500 companies), the Cisco ASA is no stranger to attention from cyberattackers. Last year for example, public PoC for another bug in the device ( CVE-2020-3452) started making the rounds, leading to a  spate of exploitation efforts.\n  The flaw tracked as CVE-2020-3580  was patched on October 21 as part of a group of XSS issues in Cisco\u2019s ASA as well as the Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, which is a unified firewall image that includes ASA management.\n \u201cAll four vulnerabilities exist because Cisco ASA and FTD software web services do not sufficiently validate user-supplied inputs,\u201d according to the advisory, which noted that the bug in question rates 6.1 out of 10 on the CVSSv3 vulnerability-severity scale.\n The number of vulnerable devices could be significant:  Researchers with Rapid7 last year found there to be 85,000 internet-accessible ASA devices. Of course, a good percentage of those could be patched against this particular vulnerability.\n \u201cExploits for appliances that may sit on the vanishing perimeter generally garner interest [from hackers], but fortunately in this case there are at least two things working against rampant exploitation,\u201d Tim Wade, technical director for the CTO team at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cFirst, a patch has been available since October. Second, an element of social engineering is required. This should provide some level of confidence for organizations with reasonable patch cycles and a security awareness program.\u201d\n Updating to the latest versions of the affected devices\u2019 software is of course recommended; however, there\u2019s more that can be done to mitigate the vulnerability, nVisium\u2019s Pate noted.\n \u201cOrganizations can ask their internal teams if they need to use the web management interface, and if so, is it available to everyone on the internet or just internally to our organization? If the web management interface isn\u2019t needed, then it should be disabled,\u201d he told Threatpost.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0  Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET \u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

\u201cThot Shit,\u201d some Black TikTok creators began  calling attention to that exploitation this week, inspiring others to  refuse to choreograph a dance to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture \u2014 much of which is  re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators and culture at large.\n The song choice probably isn\u2019t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers \u2014 twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case \u2014 and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.\n   The \u201cstrike\u201d doesn\u2019t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and  pointing to what happens when they\u2019re not around. (Predictably: not a lot.)\n On the sound\u2019s page, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how  Black creators don\u2019t get their due on the app. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song\u2019s lyrics are instructional but  non-Black TikTok still can\u2019t figure it out. The eminently danceable \u201cThot shit\u201d could build into Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn\u2019t know it.\n  When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a \u201ccritical and vibrant\u201d part of the community. \u201cWe care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said.\n Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike  cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously to a clip of Nicki Minaj\u2019s 2016 song \u201cBlack Barbies\u201d that  specifically praises Black bodies (\u201cI\u2019m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body\u2026\u201d). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators. It\u2019s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.\n The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.\n The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that  TikTok\u2019s economics are stacked against them, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators,  particularly creators of color, are turning to collective action and  even unionizing to assert their power.\n For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem \u2014 something even a quick glance at the desolate \u201cThot Shit\u201d sound makes abundantly clear.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:22:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u9ed1\u8272,black,tiktok", "title": "\u5728Tiktok\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u7f62\u5de5\u547c\u5524\u7740\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tOn TikTok, Black creators\u2019 dance strike calls out creative exploitation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/tiktok-strike-black-creators-thot-megan-thee-stallion/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u9ed1\u8272", "black", "tiktok"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dec31a285a19f7aa41b8b675fc3bbdad.jpg", "infoid": 1068348, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel de Icaza\u7684\u7740\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel De Icaza\u5728\u63a8\u7279\u4e0a\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Android Apks\u3002\n \u5fae\u8f6f\u6628\u5929\u900f\u9732\uff0cWindows 11\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Amazon App Store\u901a\u8fc7Microsoft Store\u652f\u6301Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u5b89\u88c5\u81ea\u5df1\u7684APK\u3002\n \u5b83\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n  \u6628\u5929\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba3\u5e03Windows 11\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u6bcd\u8bedAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Microsoft Store\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728PC\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210Amazon App Store\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid Apks\uff1f Sideloading\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4eceMicrosoft Store\u5916\u90e8\u5b89\u88c5Android\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e93\u3002\n \u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u201c\u662f\u201d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6839\u636e\u7740\u540d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel de Icaza\u3002 Miguel\u8d1f\u8d23\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGNOME\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728Microsoft\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684Twitter Bio\u660e\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\u201c\u5728\u5fae\u8f6f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u8bdd\u201d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e9b\u6000\u7591\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7c73\u683c\u5c14\u7684\u8840\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u3002 \n\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695aWindows 11\u4e0a\u7684\u4fa7\u9762\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid APKS\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4e0b\u8f7dAPK\uff0c\u6309\u7167EXE\uff0c\u53cc\u51fb\u5b83\uff0c\u5e76\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\uff1f \u6216\u8005\u4f1a\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u8bae\u5417\uff1f \u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u3002  \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9Windows 11\u767b\u9646\u6b64\u79cb\u5929\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\uff01 ", "note_en": "Famed software engineer Miguel de Icaza confirmed on Twitter that you will be able to sideload Android APKs in Windows 11.\n Microsoft revealed yesterday that Windows 11 will support Android apps through the Microsoft Store via the Amazon App Store. But it seems you\u2019ll be able to install your own APKs from anywhere.\n It isn\u2019t clear exactly how this will all work yet, but this is certainly exciting news.\n  Yesterday, Microsoft surprised us all by announcing that  Windows 11 will support native Android app installation. Using the Microsoft Store, you\u2019ll be able to search for, install, and use Android apps right on your PC. This is possible through an integration of the Amazon App Store.\n However, a big question loomed over the announcement: would you be able to sideload Android APKs on Windows 11? Sideloading apps would allow you to install Android programs from outside the Microsoft Store, which would give you a much larger potential library.\n It seems the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d at least according to famed engineer  Miguel de Icaza. Miguel is responsible for numerous software projects, including GNOME, and currently works at Microsoft. However, his Twitter bio explicitly says \u201cWorking at Microsoft, not speaking for them,\u201d so we need to take this news with some skepticism.\n Still, Miguel\u2019s pedigree in the software space is very high, so it\u2019s likely he\u2019s correct on this news.\n Of course, it\u2019s not quite clear how sideloading Android APKs on Windows 11 will work. Will you be able to simply download an APK as you would an EXE, double-click it, and install it? Or will there be some sort of workaround protocol? We\u2019ll need to wait to see how this develops.\n In the meantime, though, you can get even more excited about Windows 11 landing this Fall!", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:16:06", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "According to an engineer at Microsoft, Windows 11 users will have the ability to sideload Android apps onto the operating system, which looks like an answer to one of the biggest questions we had when Microsoft announced it was  bringing Android apps to Windows 11 via the Amazon Appstore ( via  Android Police). This means that once Windows 11 launches, you won\u2019t just have to stick to the apps that Amazon makes available, but it does raise some new questions about how running Android apps on Windows will work.\n For example, it\u2019s unclear what the process for running or installing a sideloaded app will be. Chrome OS technically has the ability to run sideloaded apps, too, but  the process isn\u2019t exactly easy, as it involves enabling Linux and doing some command line work. We asked Microsoft for details about what running Android apps from outside the Amazon Appstore would be like, but we haven\u2019t gotten a response.\n  It\u2019s possible that the desire for sideloading apps onto Windows wouldn\u2019t be as strong had Microsoft included Google\u2019s Play Store instead of Amazon\u2019s Appstore. While having any app store will obviously grant Windows users access to many programs that they couldn\u2019t previously run on their computers, Amazon\u2019s  has some notable omissions from its catalog. If a Windows user wanted to run the Android version of Snapchat or Apple Music, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get them from Amazon.\n While sideloading apps helps solve this problem, it does raise concerns of its own. The first is the question of where users will obtain those apps: while there aren\u2019t likely to be piracy concerns with free apps like Snapchat, the ability to load an APK could allow people to get paid apps for free from less-than-legal repositories.\n There\u2019s also the question of safety and whether Windows will have the ability to scan sideloaded apps for potentially malicious behavior, a feature that Google builds into Android already.\n While it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still a lot that Microsoft hasn\u2019t covered about what running Android apps on Windows 11\u2019s will actually be like (though  the technical details it\u2019s revealed are fascinating), it\u2019s still good to  have confirmation from someone at Microsoft that the selection of Android apps won\u2019t just be limited to what\u2019s on Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\n Hopefully Microsoft will start sharing more details on exactly how Android apps will work soon so it can get feedback from both Windows users and Android developers before the feature becomes available for everyone, likely later this year.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,android,microsoft,\u7a0b\u5e8f,engineer", "title": "Microsoft Engineer\u8868\u793a\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f ", "title_en": "Microsoft engineer says users will be able to sideload Android Apps on Windows 11", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550689/windows-11-android-app-sideload-amazon-app-store?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "android", "microsoft", "\u7a0b\u5e8f", "engineer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "78826308b14523f1baf28a8c22b34209.jpg", "infoid": 1068346, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u62a5\u7f72\u7f72\u957f\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u521a\u521a\u5c06\u5176\u70ed\u60c5\u9884\u671f\u7684\u201c\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\u201d\u62a5\u544a\u201c\uff0c\u8fd9\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9\u201d\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u98de\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u201c\uff08UFO\uff09\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u91cd\u5851\u3002\n \u661f\u671f\u4e94\u665a\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5916\u5356\uff1a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u57289\u9875\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e94\u89d2\u5927\u697c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u548c\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u6254\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u624b\uff0c\u627f\u8ba4\u4ed6\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e0d\u660e\u98de\u884c\u7269\u7684\u76ee\u51fb\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u5728\u91ca\u653e\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f1a\u8bf4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5916\u6765\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u6765\u8fc7\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u9646\u5730\u89e3\u91ca -

In the  9-page document, the Pentagon\u2019s best and brightest essentially threw up their hands and admitted that they can\u2019t explain the vast majority of apparent UFO sightings.\n The report drew immense amounts of speculation before its release because of the remote possibility that it would say something concrete about alien life, but that didn\u2019t come to pass.\n \u201cWe have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them \u2014 but we will go wherever the data takes us,\u201d an anonymous US government official  told  NBC News shortly before the report was released. \u201cWe do not have any data that indicates that any of these unidentified air phenomena are part of a foreign collection program nor do we have any data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.\u201d\n    \u201cThere are probably multiple types of UAP requiring different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting,\u201d reads one section. \u201cOur analysis of the data supports the construct that if and when individual UAP incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or U.S. industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall \u2018other\u2019 bin.\u201d\n In total, the report examined 144 incidents, 143 of which investigators were unable to explain.\n    \u201cIn a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings,\u201d reads one.\n \u201cThe UAPTF holds a small amount of data that appear to show UAP demonstrating acceleration or a degree of signature management,\u201d reads another.

And so, I&#39;m of the opinion that people have the right to decide whether to accept a vaccine or not, especially since these are experimental vaccines,&#34; said Dr. Robert Malone  during a Wednesday segment on Fox News&#39;s Tucker Carlson Tonight, saying YouTube deleted a video of him speaking about the associated risks.\n Opening the segment, Carlson shared some studies showing heart inflammation and death correlating with the use of the vaccines.\n &#34;A Norwegian study conducted of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer&#39;s corona shots. They found that at least 10 of those deaths were likely caused by the vaccine. 10%,&#34; Carlson said.\n  &#34;Young adults in the prime of their lives are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that,&#34; he said, contending Malone\u2019s expertise makes him &#34;the single most qualified&#34; person to share information about the technology and warrants him &#34;a right to speak.&#34;\n Malone clarified that he was not discouraging the use of the vaccine but was providing people with as much fair information as he could about their risks.\n &#34;This is a fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics,&#34; he said. &#34;And so, my concern is that I know that there are risks. But we don&#39;t have access to the data, and the data haven&#39;t been captured rigorously enough so that we can accurately assess those risks \u2014 and therefore \u2026 we don&#39;t really have the information that we need to make a reasonable decision.&#34;\n  &#34;That&#39;s one of my other objections, is that we toss about these words, risk-benefit analysis, casually as if it&#39;s a very deep science. It&#39;s not. Normally, at this stage, the CDC [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] would have performed those risk-benefit analyses. They would be data-based and science-based. They&#39;re not right now,&#34; Malone said.\n  Malone also said he has &#34;a bias that the benefits probably don&#39;t outweigh the risks&#34; for younger people who are being encouraged or required to take the vaccine.\n &#34;I can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below doesn&#39;t justify vaccines, and there&#39;s a pretty good chance that it doesn&#39;t justify vaccination in these very young adults,&#34; he added.\n Malone  discovered in-vitro and in-vivo RNA transfection when he was at the Salk Institute in 1988, and he subsequently invented mRNA vaccines, which are being used over 20 years later to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n YouTube told the Washington Examiner of the video that while it is &#34;open [to] discussions of potential treatments and clinical trials related to COVID-19 on YouTube, based on guidance from the CDC, FDA and other local health authorities, we don\u2019t currently allow content that recommends Ivermectin as an effective treatment or prevention method for the virus.&#34;\n &#34;As such, we removed content from Bret Weinstein&#39;s channels that violated this policy.

Of those, 247 had mild to moderate illnesses and isolated at home, never becoming sick enough to be admitted to a hospital. Six months after testing positive, 136 of the 247 (55 percent) still had lingering symptoms. And those 136 weren\u2019t only in the older age groups. In fact, in all the age groups between 16 and over 60 years old, between 50 percent and 60 percent of COVID patients reported persistent symptoms.\n For instance, of those between 16 and 30 years old, 52 percent (32 of 61) still suffered COVID-19 symptoms after six months. The most common symptoms were disturbed taste and/or smell, fatigue, difficulty breathing, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems.\n The study is small, and the exact percentages may not hold up in larger studies. However, it adds to a growing body of data finding that long-term symptoms from COVID-19 are common\u2014even in young people and/or people who had mild or even asymptomatic disease.\n    In  a non-peer-reviewed preprint study posted in March, researchers found that a third of the patients identified through medical records as suffering from so-called \u201clong-haul\u201d COVID-19 had initially reported asymptomatic cases. The study\u2019s authors, led by researchers in California, tracked the electronic medical records of 1,407 patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, but these individuals were not sick enough to be hospitalized when they were infected. Of the 1,407, about 27 percent\u2014382 people\u2014developed long-term symptoms, and a third of them were initially asymptomatic.\n Likewise, in  another study posted this month, researchers tracked health insurance records of nearly two million people who tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that about 23 percent of the patients sought care for a new post-COVID medical condition one or more months later. Of the people who had mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 that didn&#39;t require hospitalization, 27 percent experienced persistent symptoms, as did 19 percent of people who initially reported asymptomatic cases.\n The authors of the Norwegian study expressed concern about finding mild cases in young people leading to long-term problems. \u201cIt is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cParticularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress\u2026 Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:38:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

large Oort Cloud object approaching the outer regions of the solar system.\n   The discovery has caused ripples of excitement within the planetary science community because of the object\u2019s unusually large size \u2013 initial estimates suggest it may be as big as 130\u2013160\u00a0km across, substantially bigger than some of the largest comets. Studying the object could also give researchers insights into an enigmatic process in the solar system.\n Catalogued as C/2014 UN271, the wandering visitor was found in archival data captured by the DES project, which investigates the cosmological mystery of dark energy by photographing distant galaxies.\n  \u201cThe object appears in about thirty images out of the [approximately] 80,000 that were taken over six years for the survey,\u201d  Gary Bernstein of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-discovered C/2014 UN271 along with PhD student  Pedro Bernardinelli, tells  Physics World. \u201cPedro instantly recognized it as being of special interest because of its nearly-escaping orbit and the great distance at which it was first seen,\u201d he adds.\n C/2014 UN271 seems to have come from a region some 10,000\u201320,000 times farther from the Sun than Earth. This is within the Oort Cloud \u2013 an immense shell of icy objects thought to envelop the entire solar system. On its current trajectory, the object takes nearly 5.5 million years to complete just one loop of its orbit.\n The object is probably rich in ice like a comet and is currently around three billion kilometres from the Sun. It will reach its closest point, known as perihelion, in 2031. At that time, it will be positioned below the plane of the solar system, near the orbit of Saturn.\n  Part of the interest in C/2014 UN271 is that it may be something of a transition object. Astronomers believe that many of the long period comets, that occasionally appear with bright tails, actually come from the Oort Cloud. Stars wandering near the Sun can nudge these objects from their positions and over millennia they work their way inwards, with the gravity of the giant planets tweaking their paths on each visit until they reside where we see them today.\n \u201cThe fact that [C/2014 UN271] has a perihelion so far away from the Sun might be telling us that it\u2019s done this a couple of times but is still in that process of eventually becoming some of those long period comets we know and love,\u201d explains  Meg Schwamb a Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud expert at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n Scientists will be keen to see how C/2014 UN271 behaves on its long journey. Will it, for example, exhibit outbursts in activity, or even disintegrate? The  Vera C Rubin Observatory, due to begin its ground-breaking survey from Chile in 2023, should be in a prime position to record whatever happens. \u201cWith Rubin Observatory coming back and imaging the sky every three nights we\u2019re going to get an effective movie of how this object has evolved over a decade,\u201d says Schwamb.\n  Initially, C/2014 UN271 did not appear to have a cloud of material \u2013 called a coma \u2013 around it. However, astronomers using the  Las Cumbres Observatory network announced in an Astronomer\u2019s Telegram bulletin on 22 June that they have detected such a feature using a large telescope in South Africa. The emergence of a coma could be the result of ices sublimating from the body\u2019s surface.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a complex range of processes involved, with much yet to understand, and this is the biggest of the small worlds on an orbit from the Oort Cloud that we\u2019ve seen go through that start-up of activity,\u201d says  Michele Bannister, an outer solar system specialist based at the University of Canterbury.\n Some researchers have suggested C/2014 UN271 could be a destination for a sample-return mission. However,  Stephen Lowry, a comet expert at the University of Kent says \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be enough time. It can take decades to develop such a spacecraft mission.\u201d C/2014 UN271 is also likely to be out of reach of Europe\u2019s upcoming  Comet Interceptor mission due to its distance from Earth\u2019s orbit, he adds.\n Nevertheless, astronomers will likely have much to scrutinize as C/2014 UN271 creeps closer to the Sun. \u201cMore heat should mean more activity, but its perihelion is still really distant from the Sun, out beyond Saturn\u2019s orbit,\u201d says Bannister. \u201cIt\u2019ll be exciting to see just how much it brightens over the coming years.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:30:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53d1\u73b0,cloud,\u53ef\u80fd", "title": "OOR\u4e91\u5bf9\u8c61\u53d1\u73b0\u8fdb\u5165\u5916\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u7edf ", "title_en": "Oort Cloud object spotted entering the outer solar system", "transed": 1, "url": "https://physicsworld.com/a/huge-oort-cloud-object-has-been-spotted-entering-the-solar-system/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u73b0", "cloud", "\u53ef\u80fd"]}]
