bodies to make vaccines that will\u00a0\u2013 hopefully\u00a0\u2013 prevent recurrences and treatments designed to fight off\u00a0advanced tumors.\n If they prove effective, which won&#39;t be known for at least another year or two, they could be added to the arsenal of immune therapies designed to get the body to fight off its own tumors.\n &#34;We feel pretty good about enrolling patients on these trials and are hopeful that ultimately they\u00a0can demonstrate improved outcomes,&#34; said Dr. Ryan Sullivan, a melanoma expert at\u00a0Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n    Doctors are remaining cautious\u00a0because cancer vaccine\u00a0development &#34;has been littered with vaccines that haven&#39;t hit the mark,&#34; said Dr. Stephen Hahn, who had a career as an oncologist before running the Food and Drug Administration from 2019 until early this year.\n He said he&#39;s more optimistic this time because of how much researchers have learned about the role the immune system plays\u00a0in cancer.\n &#34;That gives us an edge to maybe finally get to the place where we need to be,&#34; said Hahn, who recently took a post with a venture capital firm, Flagship Pioneering. &#34;That would be just a remarkable step for all of us.&#34;\n  At the moment, most of the mRNA cancer vaccine trials are targeting\u00a0tumors such as melanoma and kidney cancer, where drugs called checkpoint inhibitors have already made a significant difference for many patients.\n &#34;My hope is that if we&#39;re successful, we&#39;ll be able to move into more tumor types where checkpoints haven&#39;t been as successful,&#34;\u00a0said Meredith McKean, Fentress&#39; oncologist at\u00a0Sarah Cannon Research Institute\u00a0in Nashville.\n  Fentress, of nearby Goodlettsville, Tennessee, thought he had a wart back in the summer of 2019 when he first noticed the odd bump on the middle finger of his left hand. He&#39;d had lots of those.\n At his wife Jennie&#39;s urging, he finally went to the dermatologist just before Thanksgiving. A few days later he got a call from the doctor. It wasn&#39;t just an ordinary wart, she told him, and he&#39;d need to come back to get a biopsy.\n  In early December, a surgeon amputated most of\u00a0his left middle finger. Fentress,\u00a0who is helping raise the two youngest of his five grandchildren, was told he had a 50% chance of recurrence. And if it did come back, his chances weren&#39;t good.\n  Over the last decade, pharmaceutical companies around the world have\u00a0been developing new ways to train the body&#39;s immune system to fight off tumors, particularly melanoma.\n  They had learned how to remove a brake installed by tumors, unleashing the warriors of the immune system. Ten years ago, only about 5% of people with advanced melanoma survived for five years. Now, nearly half\u00a0make it that long.\n  Trials of mRNA cancer vaccines, like the one\u00a0Fentress began in spring 2020, aim to boost that number even higher by adding soldiers to the fight.\n Cancer is challenging to treat because the body recognizes cancer cells as part of itself, and leaves them alone. Many of the targets of cancer therapy also are present in healthy cells, which is why cancer treatments are often so damaging.\n  Moderna, in a process similar to the other companies&#39;,\u00a0took cells from Fentress&#39; tumor. A computer analyzed the cells for tiny differences from normal cells that it could\u00a0use\u00a0as targets.\n Then the company\u00a0identified mutations that make protein variants only found on cancerous cells. They then create a single mRNA\u00a0that triggers the body to make these proteins\u00a0\u2013 just as COVID-19 vaccines trigger production of the spike protein that sits\u00a0on the surface of the virus. The presence of these protein fragments triggers the immune system to attack anything with that protein.\n  In April 2020, at Sarah Cannon, Fentress got his first shots of mRNA tailored to his tumor.\n &#34;They knocked me off my butt for about two days,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve never been as cold in my life.&#34;\n He also began\u00a0receiving a so-called checkpoint blockade drug to unleash his immune system against his cancer. The combination of lifting the brakes and adding soldiers to the fight\u00a0hopefully will keep his tumor from ever coming back.\n  It&#39;s too soon to know whether the therapy will work, but his doctor McKean, said he did well with the treatment.\n   Preventing recurrences is the &#34;ideal setting&#34; for mRNA technology,\u00a0said\u00a0Dr. \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, co-founder and chief medical officer of BioNTech.\n Once a tumor has been largely removed through surgery, a vaccine can help generate new immune soldiers known as T cells.\n &#34;The T cells will outnumber (cancer cells) and will be able to control them,&#34; T\u00fcreci said.\n Plus, a treatment soon after surgery may be able to prevent the tumor from outmaneuvering the body&#39;s immune defenses, she said.\n As with Fentress, surgical samples or a biopsy are sent to a lab where a patient&#39;s cancer cells are compared to healthy ones.\n A computer algorithm analyzes the mutations\u00a0distinct to the cancer cells, looking for ones that trigger the production of T cells, said Melissa J. Moore, Moderna&#39;s chief scientific officer, of platform research.\n So far, she said, Moderna, working with partner Merck,\u00a0has tested these personalized vaccines in about 100 patients.\n They aim eventually to make a personalized mRNA vaccine within about\u00a045\u00a0days after the patient&#39;s cancer surgery, during their\u00a0recovery.\n People who already have advanced cancer may not be able to wait for therapy. And while a few errant cancer cells are very diverse, once a tumor has spread throughout the body, it tends to develop consistent mutations, T\u00fcreci said.\n So the companies are also developing treatments that can be pre-made and &#39;taken off the shelf&#39; when a patient needs them.\n Mutated cancer cells have proteins on their surface that can be targeted by an mRNA vaccine.\u00a0For a tumor that has, say, five common mutations, a patient could get a combination of five of these vaccines.\n On Friday, BioNTech announced it was launching a new trial for this approach, testing it in 120 melanoma patients\u00a0Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and the U.S. The new treatment, given in connection with an antibody from Regeneron, is aimed at four tumor-associated antigens. More than 90% of melanoma tumors contain at least one of the four.\n Researchers now have a better understanding of how to stimulate the immune system, said\u00a0Ulrike Gnad-Vogt, interim chief development officer for CureVac, a German mRNA\u00a0 company.\n   What still needs to be proven, experts say, is whether mRNA vaccines\u00a0can help win the battle against cancer, and if so, which approach will be better for which patients.\n The federal government  currently lists 29 studies\u00a0underway or will be soon investigating mRNA cancer vaccines.\n Because these therapies\u00a0are still experimental, there&#39;s no talk yet of how much they will cost. Patients don&#39;t pay to participate in clinical research trials.\n  To be worth any cost, mRNA vaccines will have to make a significant impact on survival, adding years not just weeks to someone&#39;s life, said Sullivan, at Mass. General.\u00a0He would consider them justified\u00a0if they could boost the long-term survival rate, which now hovers around 30%-40%, to 50%-80%.\n Dr. David Braun\u00a0a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said it&#39;s always better to not make too may promises to cancer patients.\n &#34;As excited as I am about developments, I try to be cautious about overpromising,&#34; he said. &#34;Almost everyone knows someone who has not had effective therapy.&#34;\n But the fact that immune therapy has cured some cancer patients suggests there will be a way to spread those benefits to others, he said.\n In addition to treatment and prevention, mRNA can be used to turn the patient&#39;s body into a cancer drug-making machine.\n  Today, drugs like  Herceptin, which have been transformational in treating breast cancer, have to be produced in huge fermenters. These need to be kept clean and constantly scanned for imperfections, BioNTech&#39;s T\u00fcreci said.\n Instead, using mRNA technology, the patient&#39;s body could be triggered to produce the protein itself. &#34;It&#39;s an elegant and fast method, which does not need big production plants,&#34; she said.\n This research is in an early stage, T\u00fcreci noted, and details like\u00a0how often someone would need to be dosed have not yet been worked out.\n   It&#39;s made mRNA almost a household term around the world. It&#39;s proven the technology can work. And it&#39;s shown that mRNA can be made very quickly and at a tremendously large scale.\n Moderna produced its first doses of COVID-19 vaccine just two months after getting the genetic sequence of the virus \u2013 proving\u00a0that such\u00a0fast delivery is feasible, Moore said.\n Making a cancer vaccine is trickier.\u00a0With COVID, the virus&#39; genetic code led directly to a vaccine candidate, but with cancer, the tumor&#39;s genes have to be sequenced and the most potentially useful ones identified.\n  Experience with COVID-19 also helped boost production of mRNA to levels that would have seemed unbelievable just a decade ago, Moore said.\n &#34;I, in my wildest dreams\u00a0\u2026\u00a0would never have imagined that we&#39;d be making the quantities and quality of mRNA molecules we&#39;re making now with. If you had told me we were going to be doing this, I&#39;d have said you are completely crazy,&#34; she said, praising the engineers. &#34;Every time I think, &#39;Oh my God, we can&#39;t do any better than that,&#39; they surprise me.&#34;\n  It also showed how much easier it is to tackle an infectious disease like COVID-19 than cancer.\n &#34;What this taught me is gosh, it&#39;s really difficult to work in the cancer field,&#34; said T\u00fcreci, a long-time cancer researcher.\n With COVID-19, thousands of people were falling ill every day, yielding plenty of volunteers for clinical trials. It only took a few months to determine that BioNTech&#39;s vaccine provided strong protection. In cancer trials,\u00a0all five cancer centers in Germany might get only two eligible patients a month, she said. And it might be two to five years before researchers can be sure they are truly preventing someone&#39;s cancer from coming back.\n Cancer trials also were delayed during the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak\u00a0because patients couldn&#39;t make it in for treatments.\n Getting to this point was the product of decades of work by herself and others.\n &#34;There was so much to invest in terms of effort and innovation,&#34; T\u00fcreci said. &#34;Having had the opportunity\u00a0to show with the COVID vaccine that mRNA as such works is also very encouraging.&#34;\n   Fentress and his wife Jennie caught COVID-19 right after getting their first dose of vaccine.\n  They had to reschedule their second shots, but got them a few weeks later. &#34;I don&#39;t quite understand why people would refuse,&#34; said Fentress who described it as an insurance policy. &#34;I&#39;m a big fan of science and technology and stuff like that.&#34;\n  Now, he&#39;s happy he got cancer when he did. &#34;Any earlier or any later I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to participate&#34; in the clinical trial.\n  &#34;(They&#39;ve) given me a bunch of hope. They sure have,&#34; Fentress said.\u00a0&#34;If you don&#39;t have hope, you don&#39;t have any future.&#34;\n  Health and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

If you haven&#39;t subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking\u00a0 here.\n    The most-reported symptoms of COVID-19 are now a headache, sore throat, and runny nose, according to the research team behind a U.K. symptom tracking app, and medical experts here in Canada say various factors could be causing the illness to feel more like a common cold.\n   The findings come from the  ZOE COVID Symptom Study app, which allowed U.K. residents to report their daily symptoms throughout most of the pandemic, with scientific analysis provided by King&#39;s College London.\n  &#34;Since the start of May, we&#39;ve been looking at the top symptoms for the app users, and they&#39;re not the same as they were,&#34; said the team&#39;s lead researcher, Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King&#39;s College London,   in a video statement released last week.\n  Headache, sore throat, runny nose and fever are now the top four reported symptoms, all while the more-infectious  delta variant, also known as B1617,\u00a0is sweeping mainly through people under 40 in the U.K.\n    Having a cough\u00a0clocked in as the fifth most-reported symptom \u2014 less common than before, he said \u2014 while loss of smell is no longer in the top ten.\n  It&#39;s not clear based on the information released whether the researchers were looking specifically at symptoms reported by those who eventually tested positive for COVID-19, and the team did not respond to CBC News&#39; requests for an interview. But\u00a0other analyses by the group \u2014 including an  update shared on Friday \u2014 have zeroed in on confirmed cases.\n  &#34;Curiously, we did notice that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab,&#34; the team  wrote, noting anyone who&#39;s been vaccinated and starts sneezing frequently should consider getting tested.\n      In his statement, Spector stressed the shift in\u00a0top-reported symptoms could be tied to the delta variant.\n      But others say it&#39;s less likely that this highly-transmissible variant is causing an actual change in symptoms, and more likely that other factors \u2014 including the age of those getting infected, as Spector noted \u2014 may be behind the milder symptom reports.\n  Several Canadian experts who spoke to CBC News say vaccination programs prioritizing older adults, and a greater awareness of the range of symptoms, could both be playing a role in the shift, and it&#39;s a trend that could change how governments test and track COVID-19 infections in the months ahead.\n    Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious diseases specialist with McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., noted similar self-reported symptom\u00a0data doesn&#39;t exist\u00a0in Canada.\n  Still, he said it&#39;s likely COVID-19 is appearing more often as a cold-like illness here as well, not just the U.K., as more residents get vaccinated.\n  That could mean some people don&#39;t even realize they&#39;re infected, with more cases of mild COVID-19 flying under the radar.\n  &#34;I would blame this more on factors in the hosts,&#34; said Chagla, &#34;not the virus itself.&#34;\n    With older populations prioritized for vaccinations, younger people are more susceptible to getting infected from any coronavirus strain, and Chagla said they&#39;re more likely to have milder symptoms \u2014 unlike the acute shortness of breath and coughing typically associated with COVID-19 in more vulnerable age groups.\n  Canada&#39;s federal government   currently lists a new or worsening cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and a temperature equal to or over 38 C \u2014 or even just feeling feverish \u2014 among the top symptoms suggesting someone may have COVID-19.\n  But the symptoms can &#34;vary from person to person,&#34; officials note, with other possibilities including chills, fatigue, body aches, new loss of smell or taste, or gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.\n    Drawing comparisons between earlier and later rounds of symptom reporting may be tough since the age range of those still vulnerable to getting infected\u00a0is changing, said infectious diseases specialist Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor at the University of Toronto.\n  &#34;I think what we will find over time is that symptoms almost certainly vary according to age, and they may also vary according to strain or variants,&#34; he said.\n    It&#39;s also still not entirely clear why certain people have severe forms of the illness while others might not even know they&#39;re infected. Factors like older age and pre-existing health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, can\u00a0lead to worse medical outcomes,   studies have long shown, though there have been rarer instances of young, healthy adults and children winding up hospitalized or even dying.\n  Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, noted that rising reports of mild symptoms on the U.K. app could also be tied to another factor: ever-greater awareness of the illness and the range of symptoms it causes.\n  &#34;Is it truly that these are things that are related to some difference in the disease?&#34; he questioned.\n  &#34;Or is it more that we now are maybe more appreciative of those kind of minute differences, or those changes in our own health, and now maybe a little bit more prone to reporting those?&#34;\n        While it&#39;s good news\u00a0if COVID-19 truly shows up more often like a common cold, a\u00a0shift in commonly-experienced symptoms could have an impact on how regions tackle the rest of the pandemic.\n  Experts have warned   pockets of the population with lower vaccination rates are still at risk for infections, and Chagla said milder experiences that don&#39;t warrant a trip to a testing centre or hospital\u00a0could make it harder to track the virus&#39; spread within vulnerable settings in the months ahead.\n    &#34;It&#39;s going to make testing, as a strategy, a whole lot more difficult,&#34; he explained. &#34;Especially with common symptoms being something like a headache \u2014 people get headaches for a lot of reasons.&#34;\n  That means community-based testing won&#39;t be a feasible option\u00a0in Canada\u00a0for much longer despite being a staple throughout much of the pandemic,\u00a0Chagla said,\u00a0since it&#39;s hard to expect people to rush out for a test at every run-of-the-mill symptom.\n  Instead, he said the focus should be on a targeted approach, such as testing patients for COVID-19 when they enter a hospital, or routine tests within other congregate-care settings.\n  Schools in particular should be a focus this fall, Chagla added, since, as it stands, only Canadian youth aged 12 and up are eligible to be vaccinated, leaving younger school-aged kids unprotected.\n  &#34;We have to think about this long-term in terms of how we do surveillance, and how we monitor people, and what populations we continue to test,&#34; he said.\n    Kindrachuk also questioned whether people will fall back into old patterns once COVID-19 becomes less of a threat, or if the lessons of the pandemic \u2014 such as\u00a0staying home when sick \u2014 will stick in the years ahead.\n  &#34;I hope it&#39;s the latter\u2026 we&#39;ve seen how quickly public health can change based on very self-driven or self-mediated responses, whether it&#39;s masking and staying at home or those types of activities,&#34; he said.\n    Various public health\u00a0measures will stay in place\u00a0while Canada reopens, and so far, that step-by-step process in most provinces has shown progress with\u00a0  rapidly-rising vaccination rates pushing down case growth,   curbing the death toll, and easing pressure on the country&#39;s hospital system.\n  And, if the U.K. experience with shifting symptom reports proves true here as well, it could mean\u00a0more\u00a0people\u00a0are\u00a0experiencing COVID-19 as a far milder respiratory infection than the devastating illness that has taken\u00a0the lives of 26 thousand Canadians over the last year-and-a-half.\n  &#34;If you take the risk profile down to influenza, it fundamentally changes how we deal with this pathogen ... it&#39;s not something that shuts down society,&#34; Chagla said.\n    This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of health and medical science news emailed to\u00a0  subscribers every Saturday morning.

There was a big problem, though: We scoured Crucial&#39;s warranty and couldn&#39;t find any mention of cryptomining at all, making this appear to be a change to the company&#39;s warranty policy that would be applied retroactively.  We reached out to Crucial for details, and the company responded that the warranty hasn&#39;t been altered and that &#34;any confusion created by the blog post was entirely accidental.&#34;  Unfortunately, the company  altered the article on its website before responding to our query, but we had grabbed a copy before the change was made. Here&#39;s a screenshot of the offending text on the original version (and an  archive link):\n   The image above (text below) shows that the statement says quite clearly, multiple times, that any crypto mining will void Crucial&#39;s warranty \u2014 but pay particularly close attention to the section that we&#39;ve highlighted:  &#34; Using Crucial SSDs for any crypto mining will void the warranty. Even the Crucial P5, which boasts impressive endurance rates that might tempt farmers to use it for Chia plotting, is not recommended for this use. All Crucial SSDs carry 3- or 5-year warranties, depending on the model, any of which could be voided for drives used to farm Chia or mine any other type of cryptocurrency.  &#34;The warranty covers only defects arising under normal use and does not include malfunctions or failures resulting from misuse, neglect, abuse...   Usage outside of normal intended use shall include but not be limited to &#34;MINING&#34; (e.g., cryptocurrency, data mining, mining farms).&#34; \u2014    Crucial warranty statement  Crucial&#39;s own article attributed this statement to its SSD warranty, but no such clause actually exists in any of the  company&#39;s documentation.\n  Luckily for Crucial SSD owners, the company says this is all a mistake (we&#39;ll provide its official statement below). Above, you can see the now-amended text on the company&#39;s website: &#34;All Crucial SSDs carry 3- or 5-year warranties based on model, and with a maximum Total Bytes Written (TBW) based on capacity, whichever comes first.&#34;  It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Crucial is grappling with the correct approach to the  Chia mining phenomenon. Although Crucial hasn&#39;t said as much, it&#39;s entirely possible that the original snippet could be an accidental posting of a future change to its warranty policy that hasn&#39;t been finalized yet.  Creating Chia plots is an incredibly demanding workload that chews through SSD endurance at an alarming rate, posing a serious challenge for SSD makers. SSDs are generally warrantied based on two factors: Time and endurance (whichever comes first). Time is simple enough; the warranty covers a certain number of years of use. Endurance is the second variable, and it states how much data (in terabytes - TBW) you can write to your drive before the warranty is void. Unfortunately, Chia mining is incredibly unforgiving on consumer SSDs ( the firm says you should use enterprise SSDs) and often voids the warranty by quickly exceeding the endurance rating (TBW).  Much like we saw with GPU vendors reducing warranties back in 2017 to deal with Bitcoin mining, SSD makers have begun to reduce warranties to dissuade Chia miners from using their products. However, the tactic thus far has primarily involved reducing the endurance rating, like  PNY reducing its SSD endurance by 80%. Importantly, PNY&#39;s endurance reductions are  not retroactive changes applied to products that have already been purchased. Instead, the policy only applies to products that were purchased after a specific date.  The changes outlined in Crucial&#39;s original text varied from PNY&#39;s approach in significant ways. It didn&#39;t represent a change to warranty based on endurance; instead, it simply claimed to void the warranty if the device were merely   used for any type of mining. Mining consists of reading and writing workloads that are part and parcel of any type of use for any storage device, albeit at a faster rate. However, that faster rate of wear is already limited by the endurance stipulation in the warranty, making a wholesale mining ban a questionable tactic.  That&#39;s also problematic because the existing warranties don&#39;t mention this restriction, meaning it shouldn&#39;t apply to customers that have already purchased SSDs. The article heavily implied that this restriction applied to existing SSDs that had already been purchased, though. That&#39;s all not to mention that no such language exists in  any Crucial warranty.  Crucial tells  Tom&#39;s Hardware that this is all an honest mistake (emphasis added):   &#34;To clarify, our standard Crucial 3- year and 5-year SSD warranties have not changed. There are two parts to our current SSD warranties: calendar time (either 3 or 5 years) and/or total bytes written (up to 1200 Terabytes depending on the capacity), whichever comes first. That said, these standard warranty terms do apply to all Crucial SSDs.&#34;  &#34;To reiterate the above\u2026this is not a change to our warranty; we believe it is very likely that these sorts of applications will use up the TBW limit before the calendar time runs out, so this is an effort to educate our customers, so they understand the warranty parameters before they dive into crypto mining using consumer SSDs. As you know, it\u2019s not the nature of the application at issue, but rather the vast amount of data written.   The intent was to help educate the consumer on any issues that might arise with write-intensive applications. Any confusion created by the blog post was entirely accidental.&#34; \u2014  Crucial Spokesperson.  So, if you&#39;re an owner of a Crucial SSD, fear not: Despite an official communication from Crucial on its own website saying otherwise, using your SSD for mining Chia or any other cryptocurrency will not automatically void your warranty. However, Chia mining does chew through endurance at a rapid clip, so be sure you know the risks involved before you create new plots.\n      People wasting the world&#39;s limited resources in another desperate attempt to avoid honest work? At this point, I&#39;m so annoyed by these worthless parasites, I&#39;d ban them from public gatherings, not just void the warranty on the hardware they&#39;re destroying. Crucial shouldn&#39;t have backed out.\n   Reply\n I&#39;m sympathetic to companies that have their warranties abused in a new an innovative way.   If I develop an auto treadmill that can run my cars engine 24hrs a day (but no miles on the odo) to power my crypto farm I could understand why the auto manufacturer might not want to cover the claims that result.\n   Reply\n Anyway the warranty expires when your SSD reaches the TBW stated in the warranty card.\n   Reply\n Don&#39;t warranties automatically end when the drive&#39;s TBW rating is exceeded? I don&#39;t see why SSD manufacturers would have to make any changes to their warranty policy specific to chia farming. If you exceed the rating in 6 weeks, too bad. Warranty is over. If a vehicle has a 3 year 36000 mile warranty and you drive 36000 miles in 9 months, everyone knows the warranty ends then.\n   Reply\n Total rubbish Crucial , Servers read write 24/7 non stop . mining or not the warranty should be the same TBW\n   Reply\n Total rubbish Crucial , Servers read write 24/7 non stop . mining or not the warranty should be the same TBW\n Data centers buy SSD by thousand units a time so they get large discounts.

At this point stateful APIshave pretty much proved to be a failure in terms of usability and performanceand many C++ programmers  prefer  *printf instead.\n However, format strings in C have a bad reputation because of lack of typesafety: users must encode type information together with formatting information.If the user-specified and actual types don\u2019t match we have an undefinedbehavior ( godbolt):\n  This prints part of a pointer as a decimal number, in other cases you can geta segfault or something worse.\n Fortunately, modern compilers can diagnose such errors at compile timefor literal format strings but this is an opt-in which is not ideal.Encoding type information by hand is not only error-prone but also cumbersome asthis table from the  documentation of the C  stdint.h header illustrates:\n   Formatting facilities in languages other than C are usually type-safe.For example, in Python you get an exception when trying to format a string asan integer:\n &gt;&gt;&gt;  &#39;{:d}&#39; . format ( &#34;I am not a number&#34; ) Traceback  ( most  recent  call  last ):  File  &#34;&lt;stdin&gt;&#34; ,  line  1 ,  in  &lt; module &gt; ValueError :  Unknown  format  code  &#39;d&#39;  for  object  of  type  &#39;str&#39;\n Moreover, format specifiers only convey formatting information and not typewhich makes the syntax much simpler and easier to parse, eliminating numerousunnecessary specifiers. For example,  d means format as decimal, not that thetype is  int and that it should be formatted as decimal.\n   (Note that Rust\u2019s formatting facility doesn\u2019t support  d for some reason so itis replaced with  x here.)\n  error[E0277]: the trait bound `str: LowerHex` is not satisfied --&gt; &lt;source&gt;:2:18 |2 | print!(&#34;{:x}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `LowerHex` is not implemented for `str` | = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `LowerHex` for `&amp;str` = note: required by `std::fmt::LowerHex::fmt` = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\n I\u2019ve been looking into doing the same in  the {fmt} library since around 2014 but the solution remainedelusive. One approach that has been available since  {fmt} 5.0 is based on  constexpr parameter emulation trick described in  this nice post by Michael Park:\n   The solution came from a somewhat unexpected (to me) place:  C++20  consteval.With C++20 it is now possible to write just ( godbolt)\n   &lt;source&gt;:4:14: error: call to consteval function &#39;fmt::basic_format_string&lt;char, char const (&amp;)[18]&gt;::basic_format_string&lt;char [5], 0&gt;&#39; is not a constant expression fmt::print(&#34;{:d}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2587:23: note: non-constexpr function &#39;on_error&#39; cannot be used in a constant expression if (spec != &#39;p&#39;) eh.on_error(&#34;invalid type specifier&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2808:7: note: in call to &#39;check_cstring_type_spec(100, eh)&#39; detail::check_cstring_type_spec(specs_.type, eh); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2456:12: note: in call to &#39;&amp;f-&gt;parse(checker(s, {}).context_)&#39; return f.parse(ctx); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2718:39: note: in call to &#39;parse_format_specs(checker(s, {}).context_)&#39; return id &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; id &lt; num_args ? parse_funcs_[id](context_) : begin; ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2382:23: note: in call to &#39;&amp;checker(s, {})-&gt;on_format_specs(0, &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[2], &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[4])&#39; begin = handler.on_format_specs(adapter.arg_id, begin + 1, end); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2407:21: note: in call to &#39;parse_replacement_field(&amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[1], &amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[4], checker(s, {}))&#39; begin = p = parse_replacement_field(p - 1, end, handler); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:2849:7: note: in call to &#39;parse_format_string({&amp;&#34;{:d}&#34;[0], 4}, checker(s, {}))&#39; detail::parse_format_string&lt;true&gt;(str_, checker(s, {})); ^&lt;source&gt;:4:14: note: in call to &#39;basic_format_string(&#34;{:d}&#34;)&#39; fmt::print(&#34;{:d}&#34;, &#34;I am not a number&#34;); ^.../include/fmt/core.h:616:29: note: declared here FMT_NORETURN FMT_API void on_error(const char* message); ^\n  The compile-time call stack similar to a runtime stack that you get in case of an uncaught exception. This part can potentially be simplified in the future.\n {fmt} is closer to Python than Rust because format specifications areextensible while in Rust you only have a handful of \u201cglobal\u201d specifiers.This is particularly useful for date and time formatting. Parsing of formatspecifications for user-defined types is done in  constexpr functions so thesame code is used both at compile time (for checks or format string compilation)and runtime.\n  The high-level API is very simple with the check done in an implicit  constevalconstructor of a format string:\n template  &lt; typename ...  T &gt; struct  format_string  {  string_view  str ;  template  &lt; typename  S &gt;  consteval  format_string ( const  S &amp;  fmt )  :  str ( fmt )  {  // Check if fmt is a valid format string for types T...  } } template  &lt; typename ...  T &gt; void  print ( format_string &lt; T ... &gt;  fmt ,  T &amp;&amp; ...  args );\n The implicit constructor is invoked whenever we call  print triggering thecheck. The actual work is done in the format string parser which is an ordinary constexpr C++ code not worth explaining here.\n  The compile-time checks for C++20  std::format have been accepted into the C++standard ( P2216) and arecoming to the standard library implementations near you. Until then you canof course use the {fmt} library which will include compile-time checks in theupcoming major release.\n  I was somewhat concerned that the compile-time check might be prohibitivelyexpensive. However, after enabling the feature in the {fmt}\u2019s test suite thatcontains a large number of formatting function calls the effect on build timewas very small, close to the natural variation between different builds.\n  Compile-time checks are cool but it\u2019s occasionally useful to have runtime formatstrings e.g. when translating messages with  gettext. It is still supported as an opt-in(the correct default in C++, shocking!) by wrapping a format string in fmt::runtime or using type-erased overloads like  vformat:\n  This makes runtime format strings clearly visible in code and misuses easy tocatch with a code review or tools.\n It is possible to do compile-time checks of format strings that are keys intoa translation database which eliminates the main use case for runtime ones butthat\u2019s a topic for another post.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:46:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5b89\u5168,safe,fmt", "title": "\u5bfb\u6c42\u5b89\u5168\u6587\u672c\u683c\u5f0f\u5316API ", "title_en": "A quest for safe text formatting API", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zverovich.net/2021/06/16/safe-formatting-api.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5b89\u5168", "safe", "fmt"]}]
