A range of mysteries, from the wiggling of strings to the binding of quarks into protons, demanded a new mathematical tool whose silhouette he could just make out.\n \u201cThere are methods and formulae in science which serve as  master keys to many apparently different problems,\u201d he wrote in the introduction to a now famous four-page letter in  Physics Letters B. \u201cAt the present time we have to develop an art of handling sums over random surfaces.\u201d\n Polyakov\u2019s proposal proved powerful. In his paper he sketched out a formula that roughly described how to calculate averages of a wildly chaotic type of surface, the \u201cLiouville field.\u201d His work brought physicists into a new mathematical arena, one essential for unlocking the behavior of theoretical objects called strings and building a simplified model of quantum gravity.\n Years of toil would lead Polyakov to breakthrough solutions for other theories in physics, but he never fully understood the mathematics behind the Liouville field.\n Over the last seven years, however, a group of mathematicians has done what many researchers thought impossible. In a trilogy of landmark publications, they have recast Polyakov\u2019s formula using fully rigorous mathematical language and proved that the Liouville field flawlessly models the phenomena Polyakov thought it would.\n  \u201cIt took us 40 years in math to make sense of four pages,\u201d said  Vincent Vargas, a mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research and co-author of the research with  R\u00e9mi Rhodes of Aix-Marseille University,  Antti Kupiainen of the University of Helsinki,  Fran\u00e7ois David of the French National Center for Scientific Research, and  Colin Guillarmou of Paris-Saclay University.\n The three papers forge a bridge between the pristine world of mathematics and the messy reality of physics \u2014 and they do so by breaking new ground in the mathematical field of probability theory. The work also touches on philosophical questions regarding the objects that take center stage in the leading theories of fundamental physics: quantum fields.\n \u201cThis is a masterpiece in mathematical physics,\u201d said  Xin Sun, a mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania.\n  In physics today, the main actors in the most successful theories are fields \u2014 objects that fill space, taking on different values from place to place.\n In classical physics, for example, a single field tells you everything about how a force pushes objects around. Take Earth\u2019s magnetic field: The twitches of a compass needle reveal the field\u2019s influence (its strength and direction) at every point on the planet.\n Fields are central to quantum physics, too. However, the situation here is more complicated due to the deep randomness of quantum theory. From the quantum perspective, Earth doesn\u2019t generate one magnetic field, but rather an infinite number of different ones. Some look almost like the field we observe in classical physics, but others are wildly different.\n But physicists still want to make predictions \u2014 predictions that ideally match, in this case, what a mountaineer reads on a compass. Assimilating the infinite forms of a quantum field into a single prediction is the formidable task of a \u201cquantum field theory,\u201d or QFT. This is a model of how one or more quantum fields, each with their infinite variations, act and interact.\n Driven by immense experimental support, QFTs have become the basic language of particle physics. The  Standard Model is one such QFT, depicting fundamental particles like electrons as fuzzy bumps that emerge from an infinitude of electron fields. It has passed every experimental test to date (although various groups may be  on the verge of finding the first holes).\n Physicists play with many different QFTs. Some, like the Standard Model, aspire to model real particles moving through the four dimensions of our universe (three spatial dimensions plus one dimension of time). Others describe exotic particles in strange universes, from two-dimensional flatlands to six-dimensional uber-worlds. Their connection to reality is remote, but physicists study them in the hopes of gaining insights they can carry back into our own world.\n    The Liouville field, which is based on an equation from complex analysis developed in the 1800s by the French mathematician Joseph Liouville, describes a completely random two-dimensional surface \u2014 that is, a surface, like Earth\u2019s crust, but one in which the height of every point is chosen randomly. Such a planet would erupt with mountain ranges of infinitely tall peaks, each assigned by rolling a die with infinite faces.\n Such an object might not seem like an informative model for physics, but randomness is  not devoid of patterns. The bell curve, for example, tells you how likely you are to randomly pass a seven-foot basketball player on the street. Similarly, bulbous clouds and crinkly coastlines follow random patterns, but it\u2019s nevertheless possible to discern consistent relationships between their large-scale and small-scale features.\n Liouville theory can be used to identify patterns in the endless landscape of all possible random, jagged surfaces. Polyakov realized this chaotic topography was essential for modeling strings, which trace out surfaces as they move. The theory has also been applied to describe quantum gravity in a two-dimensional world. Einstein defined gravity as space-time\u2019s curvature, but translating his description into the language of quantum field theory creates an infinite number of space-times \u2014 much as the Earth produces an infinite collection of magnetic fields. Liouville theory packages all those surfaces together into one object. It gives physicists the tools to measure the curvature \u2014and hence, gravitation \u2014 at every location on a random 2D surface.\n  \u201cQuantum gravity basically means random geometry, because quantum means random and gravity means geometry,\u201d said Sun.\n Polyakov\u2019s first step in exploring the world of random surfaces was to write down an expression defining the odds of finding a particular spiky planet, much as the bell curve defines the odds of meeting someone of a particular height. But his formula did not lead to useful numerical predictions.\n To solve a quantum field theory is to be able to use the field to predict observations. In practice, this means calculating a field\u2019s \u201ccorrelation functions,\u201d which capture the field\u2019s behavior by describing the extent to which a measurement of the field at one point relates, or correlates, to a measurement at another point. Calculating correlation functions in the photon field, for instance, can give you the textbook laws of quantum electromagnetism.\n Polyakov was after something more abstract: the essence of random surfaces, similar to the statistical relationships that make a cloud a cloud or a coastline a coastline. He needed the correlations between the haphazard heights of the Liouville field. Over the decades he tried two different ways of calculating them. He started with a technique called the Feynman path integral and ended up developing a workaround known as the bootstrap. Both methods came up short in different ways, until the mathematicians behind the new work united them in a more precise formulation.\n  You might imagine that accounting for the infinitely many forms a quantum field can take is next to impossible. And you would be right. In the 1940s Richard Feynman, a quantum physics pioneer, developed one prescription for dealing with this bewildering situation, but the method proved severely limited.\n Take, again, Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Your goal is to use quantum field theory to predict what you\u2019ll observe when you take a compass reading at a particular location. To do this, Feynman proposed summing all the field\u2019s forms together. He argued that your reading will represent some average of all the field\u2019s possible forms. The procedure for adding up these infinite field configurations with the proper weighting is known as the Feynman path integral.\n  It\u2019s an elegant idea that yields concrete answers only for select quantum fields. No known mathematical procedure can meaningfully average an infinite number of objects covering an infinite expanse of space in general. The path integral is more of a physics philosophy than an exact mathematical recipe. Mathematicians question its very existence as a valid operation and are bothered by the way physicists rely on it.\n \u201cI\u2019m disturbed as a mathematician by something which is not defined,\u201d said  Eveliina Peltola, a mathematician at the University of Bonn in Germany.\n Physicists can harness Feynman\u2019s path integral to calculate exact correlation functions for only the most boring of fields \u2014 free fields, which do not interact with other fields or even with themselves. Otherwise, they have to fudge it, pretending the fields are free and adding in mild interactions, or \u201cperturbations.\u201d This procedure, known as perturbation theory, gets them correlation functions for most of the fields in the Standard Model, because nature\u2019s forces happen to be quite feeble.\n But it didn\u2019t work for Polyakov. Although he initially speculated that the Liouville field might be amenable to the standard hack of adding mild perturbations, he found that it interacted with itself too strongly. Compared to a free field, the Liouville field seemed mathematically inscrutable, and its correlation functions appeared unattainable.\n   Polyakov soon began looking for a workaround. In 1984, he teamed up with Alexander Belavin and Alexander Zamolodchikov to develop a technique called the  bootstrap \u2014 a mathematical ladder that gradually leads to a field\u2019s correlation functions.\n To start climbing the ladder, you need a function which expresses the correlations between measurements at a mere three points in the field. This \u201cthree-point correlation function,\u201d plus some additional information about the energies a particle of the field can take, forms the bottom rung of the bootstrap ladder.\n From there you climb one point at a time: Use the three-point function to construct the four-point function, use the four-point function to construct the five-point function, and so on. But the procedure generates conflicting results if you start with the wrong three-point correlation function in the first rung.\n Polyakov, Belavin and Zamolodchikov used the bootstrap to successfully solve a variety of simple QFT theories, but just as with the Feynman path integral, they couldn\u2019t make it work for the Liouville field.\n Then in the 1990s two pairs of physicists \u2014  Harald Dorn and Hans-J\u00f6rg Otto, and  Zamolodchikov and his brother Alexei \u2014 managed to hit on the three-point correlation function that made it possible to scale the ladder, completely solving the Liouville field (and its simple description of quantum gravity). Their result, known by their initials as the DOZZ formula, let physicists make any prediction involving the Liouville field. But even the authors knew they had arrived at it partially by chance, not through sound mathematics.\n  Educated guesses are useful in physics, but they don\u2019t satisfy mathematicians, who afterward wanted to know where the DOZZ formula came from. The equation that solved the Liouville field should have come from some description of the field itself, even if no one had the faintest idea how to get it.\n \u201cIt looked to me like science fiction,\u201d said Kupiainen. \u201cThis is never going to be proven by anybody.\u201d\n  In the early 2010s, Vargas and Kupiainen joined forces with the probability theorist R\u00e9mi Rhodes and the physicist Fran\u00e7ois David. Their goal was to tie up the mathematical loose ends of the Liouville field \u2014 to formalize the Feynman path integral that Polyakov had abandoned and, just maybe, demystify the DOZZ formula.\n As they began, they realized that a French mathematician named Jean-Pierre Kahane had discovered, decades earlier, what would turn out to be the key to Polyakov\u2019s master theory.\n \u201cIn some sense it\u2019s completely crazy that Liouville was not defined before us,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cAll the ingredients were there.\u201d\n The insight led to three milestone papers in mathematical physics completed between 2014 and 2020.\n  They first polished off the path integral, which had failed Polyakov because the Liouville field interacts strongly with itself, making it incompatible with Feynman\u2019s perturbative tools. So instead, the mathematicians used Kahane\u2019s ideas to recast the wild Liouville field as a somewhat milder random object known as the Gaussian free field. The peaks in the Gaussian free field don\u2019t fluctuate to the same random extremes as the peaks in the Liouville field, making it possible for the mathematicians to calculate averages and other statistical measures in sensible ways.\n \u201cSomehow it\u2019s all just using the Gaussian free field,\u201d Peltola said. \u201cFrom that they can construct everything in the theory.\u201d\n In 2014, they  unveiled their result: a new and improved version of the path integral Polyakov had written down in 1981, but fully defined in terms of the trusted Gaussian free field. It\u2019s a rare instance in which Feynman\u2019s path integral philosophy has found a solid mathematical execution.\n \u201cPath integrals can exist, do exist,\u201d said  J\u00f6rg Teschner, a physicist at the German Electron Synchrotron.\n With a rigorously defined path integral in hand, the researchers then tried to see if they could use it to get answers from the Liouville field and to derive its correlation functions. The target was the mythical DOZZ formula \u2014 but the gulf between it and the path integral seemed vast.\n \u201cWe\u2019d write in our papers, just for propaganda reasons, that we want to understand the DOZZ formula,\u201d said Kupiainen.\n  The team spent years prodding their probabilistic path integral, confirming that it truly had all the features needed to make the bootstrap work. As they did so, they built on earlier work by Teschner. Eventually, Vargas, Kupiainen and Rhodes succeeded with a paper posted in  2017 and another in October  2020, with Colin Guillarmou. They derived DOZZ and other correlation functions from the path integral and showed that these formulas perfectly matched the equations physicists had reached using the bootstrap.\n \u201cNow we\u2019re done,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cBoth objects are the same.\u201d\n The work explains the origins of the DOZZ formula and connects the bootstrap procedure \u2014which mathematicians had considered sketchy \u2014 with verified mathematical objects. Altogether, it resolves the final mysteries of the Liouville field.\n \u201cIt\u2019s somehow the end of an era,\u201d said Peltola. \u201cBut I hope it\u2019s also the beginning of some new, interesting things.\u201d\n  Vargas and his collaborators now have a unicorn on their hands, a strongly interacting QFT perfectly described in a nonperturbative way by a brief mathematical formula that also makes numerical predictions.\n Now the  literal million-dollar question is: How far can these probabilistic methods go? Can they generate tidy formulas for all QFTs? Vargas is quick to dash such hopes, insisting that their tools are specific to the two-dimensional environment of Liouville theory. In higher dimensions, even free fields are too irregular, so he doubts the group\u2019s methods will ever be able to handle the quantum behavior of gravitational fields in our universe.\n But the fresh minting of Polyakov\u2019s \u201cmaster key\u201d will open other doors. Its effects are already being felt in probability theory, where mathematicians can now wield previously dodgy physics formulas with impunity. Emboldened by the Liouville work, Sun and his collaborators have already imported equations from physics to solve  two  problems regarding random curves.\n  Physicists await tangible benefits too, further down the road. The rigorous construction of the Liouville field could inspire mathematicians to try their hand at proving features of other seemingly intractable QFTs \u2014 not just toy theories of gravity but descriptions of real particles and forces that bear directly on the deepest physical secrets of reality.\n \u201c[Mathematicians] will do things that we can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said  Davide Gaiotto, a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 18:15:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u91cf\u5b50,quantum,\u7406\u8bba", "title": "\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e862D\u7248\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Mathematicians Prove 2D Version of Quantum Gravity Works", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91cf\u5b50", "quantum", "\u7406\u8bba"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6c7218f4516925491aecf0e24d00717c.jpg", "infoid": 1066674, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\u8bf4\u5979\u5728\u9ad8\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u670917\u5c81\uff0c\u5f53\u5979\u7684\u7537\u670b\u53cb\u5c06\u5979\u878d\u5165\u88f8\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u3002\n   \u5979\u8bf4\u5979\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5b83\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5979\u5728\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u6536\u5230\u4e00\u4f4d\u4eb2\u5bc6\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff1a\uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u505a\u4e86\u8272\u60c5\u7247\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u5979\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4f17\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5979\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u540c\u610f\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u7acb\u5373\uff0c\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u6211\u3002\u6211\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8138\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8863\u670d - \u7acb\u5373\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u6389\u8fdb\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u809a\u5b50\u91cc\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n  Isabella\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5047\u540d\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff0c\u8bf4Pornhub\u6ca1\u6709\u8bd5\u56fe\u8054\u7cfb\u5979\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u5979\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u6216\u8be2\u95ee\u89c6\u9891\u662f\u5426\u662f\u540c\u610f\u7684\u3002\n CBS\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e34\u540d\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff09\u5171\u540c\u8c08\u5230\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff0c\u4ed6\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u5bf9\u9635MindGeek\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fPornhub\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u8272\u60c5\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\n \u672c\u5468\u5ba1\u8bae\u7684\u6c11\u4e8b\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6307\u8d23\u516c\u53f8\u8fd0\u884cA\uff06\uff0334;\u72af\u7f6a\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\uff06\uff0334;

But the women suing the company have accused it of exploiting them for profit, hosting and promoting graphic videos of rape, revenge porn and even videos that depict child sexual abuse.\n  Isabella said more than 200,000 people ultimately watched the video \u2014 &#34;including everybody at my college, pretty much,&#34; she said.\n &#34;The view count on the video will forever haunt my dreams,&#34; she said. &#34;Just knowing that that many people saw it really messed me up.&#34;\n After learning how many people had seen her video on Pornhub, she said she battled with a sense of shame and worthlessness and had to transfer schools. She couldn&#39;t look in a mirror for six months and drew into isolation, she said, fearful that people at her new school would recognize her.\n And she struggled with the feeling that she&#39;d brought this on herself. &#34;It&#39;s taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I am a victim of something,&#34; she said.\n   The lawsuit alleges that Pornhub&#39;s business model is built around funneling online traffic to videos like Isabella&#39;s.\n  MindGeek owns and operates more than 100 pornographic websites, and its brands include Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn and Xtube. MindGeek also owns porn production companies that create content, but for years, a majority of the content on Pornhub was uploaded by unverified users. MindGeek operates some paid-subscription sites, but Pornhub is free for anyone to access and earns money through advertising revenue and optional, premium subscriptions.\n Isabella said she decided to join the lawsuit to protect other victims. A draft of the lawsuit says MindGeek &#34;embraced under-age, non-consensual, and pirated content in its business&#34; and claims the company &#34;profited from content produced through human trafficking.&#34;\n Michael Bowe, the lawyer representing the women, said the company has skirted rules that have long been in place to protect actors in the &#34;traditional&#34; porn industry, which requires producers to verify the age and identities of the people featured in videos.\n &#34;The online porn industry has essentially been the Red Light District of commerce,&#34; Bowe said. &#34;This new industry of online porn, for the last 10 years, has been allowed by law enforcement, government entities, to operate by a different set of rules. Basically, no rules or oversight.&#34;\n Bowe has spent the past year building a civil case against the company based on racketeering laws normally used to go after mobsters and drug gangs.\n Last December, after a wave of backlash over nonconsensual content on the platform, Mastercard and Visa blocked card users from making purchases on Pornhub. Under scrutiny, MindGeek announced an overhaul of its procedures and took down millions of videos uploaded by unverified users, deleting 80% of the content on its site.\n  MindGeek executives also announced last year that they had removed the ability for users to download videos and added a requirement that people posting videos verify their identification.\n   &#34;We are committed to eradicating illegal content,&#34; the company said in a statement to CBS News, adding that earlier this year, the company enacted &#34;the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history.&#34;\n The statement said, &#34;We have banned uploads from unverified users, eliminated downloads, expanded our moderation processes, and partnered with dozens of non-profit organizations around the world, steps that surpass those of any other major platform on the internet.&#34;\n In a statement Thursday after the lawsuit was filed, MindGeek said the allegations in the complaint that Pornhub is a &#34;criminal enterprise&#34; are &#34;utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false.&#34;\n During a February hearing before the Canadian House of Commons, MindGeek&#39;s CEO Feras Antoon decried online child abuse imagery. &#34;Sexual material, child abuse material has no place on our platform. It makes us lose money,&#34; he said. &#34;It completely ruins the brand that we have been trying to build for over a decade.&#34;\n But the company still does not require its users to verify the identity or age of those featured in its videos, something that&#39;s standard in the traditional porn industry. The company also doesn&#39;t seek to confirm the consent of everyone who appears in videos posted to the site, a measure that victims of abuse believe would help keep nonconsensual content off porn sites.\n Some of the victims in the lawsuit told CBS News they joined after they discovered their non-consensual videos on Pornhub and reached out to an activist named Laila Mickelwait. In 2020, Mickelwait founded a campaign called Traffickinghub which started a petition to &#34;Shut Down Pornhub.&#34; She told CBS News it now has more than 2 million signatures.\n  During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in March, Mickelwait called Pornhub a &#34;mega-sex trafficker,&#34; and said the site was infested with non-consensual pornographic content. &#34;The company knowingly has enabled and profited from mass amounts of sex acts induced by force, fraud or coercion, and the commercial sexual abuse of children,&#34; she said.\n   Traffickinghub says it&#39;s &#34;powered by&#34; a religious organization called Exodus Cry, which has been criticized for its efforts to criminalize parts the sex industry and abolish pornography altogether. On its website, Exodus Cry advocates for laws to &#34;end the sex industry&#34; and &#34;reduce the demand for commercial sex.&#34;\n Pornhub&#39;s executives have said the company was designed to celebrate freedom of expression and empower adults. And in its statement Thursday, the company claims Bowe is a &#34;soldier of the ultra-right wing effort to shut down the adult content industry.&#34;\n But Bowe said his goal isn&#39;t to ban online pornography, but rather, to force it to comply with regulations.\n He told CBS News: &#34;This case is not about porn, it&#39;s about rape. This is a legitimate industry that consenting people have every right to participate in. It just needs to be done legally and not with illegal content.&#34;\n Of the 34 women suing the company, 14 said they were underage in videos uploaded to PornHub, and 14 were victims of people charged or convicted of sex crimes.\n  One of those victims is Aubrey, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity. She says her ex-husband secretly recorded a video of them having sex, then uploaded it to Pornhub without her consent or her knowledge. The ex-husband now faces criminal charges of forcible rape, domestic assault and non-consensual dissemination of private sexual images by posting the video on Pornhub.\n Aubrey learned about the video from a friend in 2018, after she said it had garnered more than 400,000 views.\n   &#34;I will never, ever be able to recover the emotional pain that this has caused me,&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;It truly, truly was a living nightmare. I \u2014 I didn&#39;t \u2014 everybody had seen everything about me. And that&#39;s just \u2014 that&#39;s a very private moment. And it&#39;s a very vulnerable moment. And it&#39;s just \u2014 it&#39;s hard to come to terms with. That the world has seen that.&#34;\n Aubrey said she struggled to convince Pornhub to remove her video. Emails reviewed by CBS News show that after she contacted the company to tell them the video was not taken consensually, a Pornhub representative challenged her.\n He asked, &#34;Are you the female in the video? How do you know this is you?&#34;\n Aubrey responded, &#34;I know this is me by several things. That is my bed, I have a mole on my right hip, that is my face, my voice, THAT IS ME and I am pissed.&#34;\n After a three-day exchange, Pornhub took down the video, but even then, Aubrey said she found it posted to other porn websites \u2014 renamed and re-uploaded, by users she didn&#39;t know.\n She said she felt defeated to know that the video was still online. &#34;I felt like everything was taken away from me. And I had no power. I had no say in it. I was completely powerless,&#34; she said.\n One former executive, who worked at MindGeek before the company overhauled its policies, provided information included in the lawsuit against MindGeek. He said that illegal content was seen as &#34;good&#34; for business. He agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. He fears retribution.\n   He said the company favored keeping more content on the site. &#34;I mean, if you offer everything on the site, there is something for everyone,&#34; he said. &#34;The more you have, the better it is. So for all the free sites like Pornhub, more content is always better.&#34;\n He said when content was flagged on PornHub, MindGeek often moved it to one of the dozens of other porn sites it owned. &#34;Removed content popped up on all their other sites and no one really cared,&#34; he said.\n In its statement to CBS News, MindGeek said: &#34;The spread of illegal content is an existential threat to the internet, and every platform has the moral obligation to join the fight against it. Illegal material on the internet harms its victims, internet users and all platforms that operate online. Any suggestion that the company tolerates or celebrates this material is patently false.&#34;\n   One victim, Michelle, who is using a pseudonym, said that she was targeted at age 15 by an abuser who has since been convicted of blackmailing children to sexually abuse themselves on camera.\n She said he coerced her to take sexual photos and videos, which he later sold as &#34;box sets&#34; to other offenders. Some of those videos were uploaded to Pornhub, and from there, she said, they spread.\n She said that the videos&#39; uploads on Pornhub had &#34;way, way worse&#34; of an impact on her than even her blackmailer&#39;s initial abuse. &#34;It was only when my videos went on sites like Pornhub that my life started to become something that I couldn&#39;t live out properly,&#34; she said, adding that she stopped eating, leaving the house and once attempted suicide.\n Michelle reported the videos to Pornhub during the fall of 2018 and continued flagging content for the site to take down throughout 2019. And although Pornhub took down all unverified content last year, Michele said she continues to find images of her abuse re-uploaded on other websites. She said, &#34;Any other place I find my videos there&#39;s some type of mention of Pornhub or where they originated from, and my name was always with them.&#34;\n   Strangers continue to contact her about her videos, she said, and one man even showed up at her house, telling her that he&#39;d found her through Pornhub.\n The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which investigates reports of child sexual abuse, told CBS News that MindGeek began reporting suspected child abuse to their Cyber Tipline in April 2020, and throughout 2020, reported more than 13,000 instances of child sexual abuse imagery. In its statement, MindGeek said those reports represent approximately 4,000 unique incidents.\n &#34;According to leading advocates, non-profits and third-party analyses, Pornhub&#39;s safeguards and technologies have proven effective,&#34; the statement said, adding that according to  the center&#39;s data, one major social media platform was responsible for more than 20 million reports.\n Despite that, the center said that victims and survivors who contact them &#34;express frustration&#34; with MindGeek&#39;s record in removing sexually abusive content, noting their expectations for MindGeek to take greater steps to proactively identify and remove the content from its site.\n The center added that it receives information from the public about suspected child sexual abuse imagery on MindGeek sites &#34;on a daily basis.&#34;\n  Another victim, Ashley, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity, said in August of last year, she learned that Pornhub was hosting a video of her being assaulted while unconscious.\n She said her then-husband drugged and raped her, and had posted the assault on Pornhub. The video was tagged &#34;sleeping pills,&#34; and she says it had been on the site for three years and racked up tens of thousands of views before she learned of its existence.\n   Her abuser was arrested last week on charges of sexual assault, distributing intimate images without consent and indecent exposure. She said his arrest came as a relief, but she hopes MindGeek will be held responsible too.\n Ashley said the changes the company made to their site last year, which require users to upload a government-issued ID in order to post content, may not have prevented a situation like hers.\n &#34;Of course you have consent from the person uploading the video. They&#39;re the one uploading it,&#34; she said. &#34;But it&#39;s the people in the video that really need to be asked.&#34;\n Even after Pornhub deactivated the original video of her rape, she said the thumbnail image of the video, which shows her unconscious and naked, continues to populate in Google image search results to this day.\n She said, &#34;There shouldn&#39;t be anywhere safer in the world than at home in your own bed, right? And you shouldn&#39;t be able to go to bed one night and wake up on Pornhub.&#34;\n The new lawsuit asks a federal court in California to order MindGeek to pay damages to the victims, an amount Bowe told CBS News that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Victims who spoke with CBS News also hope the company will someday be held criminally responsible.\n &#34;How would they like it if it was someone they loved? Their child? Their sister?&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;They&#39;ve got to take steps to prevent this from ever happening to anybody ever again.&#34;\n   In its statement, MindGeek said: &#34;Anyone who attempts to post nonconsensual imagery or child sexual abuse material on the internet is a criminal, and we are committed to remaining at the forefront of the internet when it comes to the elimination of illegal content. Every online platform has the responsibility to join this fight, and it requires collective action and constant vigilance. We hope other platforms will use our model to help eradicate unwanted content.&#34;\n Jessica Kegu, Sara Cook, Martin Finn and Jennie Kamin contributed to this report.

", "note_en": "We have a special blog today from one of our own design engineers, Simon Martin. He\u2019s the designer of Raspberry Pi 400 and our High Quality Camera and spends his free time tinkering with electronic music.\n  Simon has wanted to make his own electronic musical instrument with Raspberry Pi for some time. He designed a circuit board for the project a year ago, but it lay around in a drawer in his desk while he finished  Raspberry Pi 400. Finally, the winter months gave him the incentive to get it working.\n  Simon: The Synth6581 device doesn\u2019t look much like an electronic musical instrument, but just like circuit boards stacked on top of a  Raspberry Pi 4. You have to plug a musical keyboard into a USB port and a pair of speakers into the audio jack on the bottom board to make it work.\n  The code is written almost entirely in Python, with a little bit of C to speed up the communications to the chips. I designed and laid out the circuit boards, which were ordered online. The first six boards cost only \u00a320, but the components were another \u00a3100. I spent more than a day soldering the components on the boards by hand. It took much more time to check every chip and connection worked, a common problem with hand-soldering new boards.\n   And Synth6581 is no ordinary sounding musical instrument. It\u2019s based on the music chip inside a vintage computer: the Commodore 64.\u00a0The microchips are almost forty years old and they have a quirky sound that kids in the 1980s loved and parents hated.\u00a0By the way, did you know that the Commodore 64 was the inspiration for Raspberry Pi 400?\n   I was one of many hobby programmers in the 1980s that used to attempt to program Commodore 64s. Much like people today dabble with programming on Raspberry Pi 400s, kids and adults were dabbling with the BASIC programming language on their Commodore 64s back then.\u00a0Nowadays, Raspberry Pis have video, graphics, and audio readily available, but back in the 1980s, the hardware registers had to be \u2018poked\u2019 one by one into the console window. You had to get quite technical just to get the computer to make a musical sound. Those sounds came from the MOS6581 or \u2018SID\u2019 chip. It had such a famous sound character that it formed the basis of the chiptune music genre, and people are still writing music on Commodore 64s today.\n   By borrowing a few chips from broken Commodore 64s, including one or two lying around Raspberry Pi Towers, I made those 1980s ping noises into a polyphonic synthesiser controlled in Python on Raspberry Pi. The registers in the SID chips are simply being \u2018poked\u2019 by Raspberry Pi instead of Commodore 64. I also reverse-engineered the music from old games and made the sound effects and instruments work across the keyboard.\n   This device is unique: only one of these will ever be built, so please don\u2019t wait for a launch date. There were over 10 million chips manufactured for Commodore 64, but production of the chips ended nearly 30 years ago. The Commodore 64s and spare parts for them are still in high demand, which is pushing up second hand prices. Nonetheless, the code and schematics are available online  on GitHub, and I invite other Raspberry Pi users to use them to make musical instruments out of other games consoles. I reckon Sega Megadrive has a lot of potential for a Raspberry Pi port\u2026", "posttime": "2021-06-18 17:32:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "raspberry-pi,pi,\u8986\u76c6\u5b50", "title": "Commodore 64\u548cRaspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581 ", "title_en": "Commodore 64 and Raspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/commodore-64-raspberry-pi-4-synth6581/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pi", "\u8986\u76c6\u5b50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066670, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u6211\u5750\u5728\u6211\u7684\u706b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9760\u7740\u7a97\u6237\u7565\u5fae\u6253\u5f00\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u5c4f\u5e55\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u4fdd\u6301\u5b83\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5173\u95ed\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u4f55\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u7a0d\u5fae\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6211\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5230\u5ba4\u5185\u3002\n \u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u7684\uff0c\u81ed\u5473\u7684\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u82cd\u8747\u662fAbuzz\u3002\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u9633\u53f0\u4e0a\u5f88\u96be\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u9080\u8bf7\u6240\u6709\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u8fdb\u5165\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u788e\u5c51\u7684\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u3002\n \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u601d\u8003\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\u91cc\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\uff1f\u5f53\u4f60\u6ca1\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u65f6\uff0c\u5468\u65e5\u4e0b\u5348\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u9664\u975e\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u82cd\u8747\uff09\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6b64\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u822a\u5176\u5783\u573e\u5145\u586b\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\uff0cI\uff06\uff0339;

As there are no screens, I wanted to keep it as closed as possible to keep out any bugs. However, I needed to keep it somewhat open so that I&#39;d be able to get back indoors.\n As it was a hot, smelly day in New York City, the flies were abuzz. I found it hard to relax on my illegal balcony knowing that I was basically inviting all of the flies into my apartment for an all-you-can-eat buffet of human detritus.\n This got me thinking how effective the partially closed window is at keeping out the flies. What does the function of flies in my apartment over time look like? The perfect question for a Sunday afternoon when you have no friends (unless you count the flies).\n  In order to run this simulation, we need a model of how a fly navigates its trash-filled world. As a first pass, I&#39;ll model a fly as moving in a random direction with a random speed for each timestep of the simulation. Pretty simple, but flies do appear to be relatively simple creatures.\n If we take a look at the trajectory of a single fly using this model, it does indeed look random:\n  Now let&#39;s simulate a bunch of flies. To do this, first we initialize an array  xs to hold the position of the flies. We&#39;ll normally distributed this in a  2*WORLDHEIGHT x WORLDHEIGHT square. We&#39;ll also initialize all the flies to be outside (setting the window to be at  x = 0 and indoors to be  x &gt; 0).\n xs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  *  np . array ([[ WORLDHEIGHT  *  2 ,  WORLDHEIGHT ]]) xs [( xs [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 ), 0 ]  *=  - 1 xs [( xs [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  *=  - 1\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  xps  =  xs  +  vs  *  dt  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  inoutmask  =  ( np . sign ( xps [:, 0 ])  *  np . sign ( xs [:, 0 ]))  ==  - 1  m  =  ( xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 1 ])  /  ( xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 0 ]  +  1e-7 )  b  =  xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  m  *  xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  invalidmask  =  b  &gt;  WINDOWHEIGHT  idxs  =  np . where ( inoutmask )[ 0 ][ invalidmask ]  xps [ idxs , 0 ]  =  1e-4  *  np . sign ( xs [ idxs , 0 ])  xps [ idxs , 1 ]  =  b [ invalidmask ]  # 3. Bound the flies.  xps [( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT ), 0 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [(( xps [:, 1 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT )  &amp;  ( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 )), 1 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [( xps [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  =  0  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  xs  =  xps  vs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  vs  =  ( vs  /  np . sqrt (( vs  **  2 ). sum ( 1 )[:, np . newaxis ]))  *  maxv  return  ( xs ,  vs )\n Step 2 might require a little explaining. Every timestep, each fly travels in a line from its previous position to its new position. We only want the flies to be able to travel through the crack at the bottom, so we need a way to ensure they can&#39;t travel through the glass.\n To do that, we first find all of the flies that changed indoor/outdoor state this timestep ( inoutmask). This can be done by comparing the sign of the previous and current  x since the window is at  x = 0. We can then calculate where the fly crossed the line  x = 0 using some middle school math.\n It should be impossible for the fly&#39;s y-intercept to be greater than the height of the window crack, we for thos flies ( invalidmask), we set their y to be where they tried to cross the window and their x to be some small epsilon on the side that they came from. I don&#39;t just set it to 0 because then the fly would not get picked up by  inoutmask and may be able to travel through the glass on the next iteration.\n Step 3 just makes sure that the fly does not go through the arbitrary walls of the world. Currently, only the floor and the walls of my apartment are defined so a fly can escape to infinity in the -x or +y directions while outdoors. Here&#39;s a diagram of the world for the visually-inclined:\n ---------------- y = h | | | | | | | _________________________________| x = -h x = 0 x = h\n OK, we can finally see the flies fly! Because of the random velocity vectors, they unsurprisingly look quite jittery:\n    This is great and all but the flies don&#39;t look too realistic. Let&#39;s make their velocity vectors vary smoothly so that they don&#39;t look like a dubstep light show.\n To do this, we&#39;ll pick a random angle in the range  [-pi/8, pi/8] to rotate each fly&#39;s velocity vector by. In this simulation, we won&#39;t vary the magnitude of their velocities at all.\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  ...  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  ...  # 2.5. Flip the x-velocity of the invalid flies.  vs [ idxs , 0 ]  *=  - 1  # 3. Bound the flies.  ...  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  8.  Cs ,  Ss  =  np . cos ( dthetas ),  np . sin ( dthetas )  Rs  =  np . array ([[ Cs ,  - Ss ],  [ Ss ,  Cs ]]). transpose ( 2 ,  0 ,  1 )  vs  =  ( Rs  *  vs . reshape ( NFLIES ,  2 ,  1 )). sum ( axis = 1 )\n While not necessary, Step 2.5 was added so that the flies don&#39;t take get stuck keep trying to go through the window as their velocity rotates slowly.\n In Step 4, instead of choosing new random values for  vs, we create a random rotation matrix for each fly and rotate their initial velocities by it.\n If we take a look at the animation now, we can see the flies look slightly more realistic (if not still a bit spazzy):\n   While the flies now obey the laws of aviation, there&#39;s still something that seems missing. Normally, flies  want to get indoors. They  need to get indoors. So to simulate this, I added an attractor (maybe a rotting piece of fruit) at a position  A indoors to lure the flies.\n To do this, I added one variable to the fly&#39;s state: a scalar value  a which represents how close they are to the delicious piece of fruit. The fly will be able to remember the most recent value of  a so that it can know whether it&#39;s getting warmer or colder.\n  def  attraction ( x ,  A ):  return  1.  /  ( 1e-7  +  np . sqrt ((( x  -  A . reshape ( 1 ,  2 ))  **  2 ). sum ( 1 ))) def  update ( xs ,  vs ,  ats ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  ...  ats  =  attraction ( xs ,  A )  atps  =  attraction ( xps ,  A )  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  16.  wrongmask  =  atps  &lt;  ats  dthetas [ wrongmask ]  +=  np . random . randn ( wrongmask . sum ())  *  np . pi  /  8.  ...  return  ( xs ,  vs ,  ats )\n  If the attraction increased from the previous timestep, keep going in the same direction (do nothing)\n We add another random rotation in the range of  [-pi/16, pi/16] just to keep things interesting.\n The fly will keep going in a straight line (with some random jitter) as long as the attraction it sense is increasing. If it senses that it&#39;s going in the wrong direction, it will more aggressively explore its neighborhood until it finds a good direction to head in.\n As you can see by the new trajectory, this seems to work fairly well for simulating a stupid but well-motivated fly:\n  However, it seems on the aggregate, the flies just swarm the attractor. Thankfully this isn&#39;t the case in real life as I currently only have two flies in my apartment.\n   With this information in hand, I finally wanted to answer the popular game show question: &#34;How many flies are in my apartment?&#34;\n The first experiment I ran was to plot the average number of flies given how open the window was over a few max velocities. Here is the result for the random flies:\n  Quite nicely, it turns out that as the window, gets more open, the number of flies indoors increases linearly.\n For the smooth flies, we see a less linear function. I&#39;m not quite sure why.\n  The attracted flies produce an even more asymptotic (is that a word?) plot. My hypothesis is that this is because the flies are more likely to find their way to the trash than in other models so it doesn&#39;t help them as much when the window is more open.\n  Then I wanted to see how long the simulation ran for affected the number of flies. We see similar results for the random and smooth flies. With faster moving flies (the orange and green plots), random moving or in the smooth case randomly initialized flies are more likely to barrel off towards infinity when outside. Therefore, the total number of flies decreases as the simulation progresses.\n  In the case of the attracted flies, we again see that a higher max velocity results in the number of flies peaking earlier. However, because the flies have some knowledge as to what direction to go in, they tend not to drift out into the ether and the population eventually plateaus.\n   Thanks for joining me on this pointless exerise and in case you missed it the answer to the titular question is two.

", "note_en": "When a Russian scientist identified the Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple, harvests in Kazakhstan\u2019s forests were bountiful; now this wild fruit is threatened.\n        Winter\u2019s cool indifference had already embraced the snow-tipped peaks of the Tian Shan mountain system, winds whispering the tall trees into a state of undress.\n \u201cIt is cold,\u201d said Alexey Raspopov, a guide with  Trekking Club Kazakhstan, pointing to the dashboard thermometer of his 4x4 as we ascended, leaving Kazakhstan\u2019s second city Almaty to disappear beneath a layer of smog.\n One could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple\n After driving for about two hours to the Turgen Gorge, we abandoned the vehicle and continued on foot. The climb was not difficult, but biting gusts threatened to take the feeling from my fingertips and steal the words from my lips as I asked Raspopov, who has led hikes in the region for the past 30 years, about the landscape that unfolded before us.\n \u201cIt has changed a lot,\u201d he said, calling upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the thickening pollution and a shrinking glacier to illustrate his point \u2013 not that he needed to. The near disappearance of the forests of  Malus sieversii, or wild apple, that once blanketed the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau section of the Tian Shan mountains (which also stretches to Kyrgyzstan), are testament enough to the changing times.\n   When storied Russian scientist Nikolai Vavilov first identified the  Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple,  Malus domestica, in 1929, the region\u2019s forests were thick and their harvests bountiful.\n \u201cAll around the city one could see a vast expanse of wild apples covering the foothills,\u201d wrote Vavilov of his visit to Almaty, then Kazakhstan\u2019s capital. \u201cOne could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple.\u201d\n Vavilov based these words on his idea that the \u2018centres of origin\u2019 of a species lie in the places where you find its highest genetic diversity. His observations that all domestic apples may originate from Almaty has since been confirmed by modern genetics.\n \u201cAt some point, either seeds, trees or budwood from desirable trees was taken out of the [ Malus sieversii] forests by humans and grown elsewhere,\u201d said Gayle Volk, a research plant physiologist at the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). \u201cIn some cases, those trees could have hybridised with wild apple species growing in other regions. The selection process continued.\u201d\n  Silk Road trade is believed to have scattered the fruit far and wide, eventually reaching North America with European colonists.\n Despite being the first to scientifically assert Almaty\u2019s association with the apple, Vavilov was not the first to observe fruit\u2019s influence on the region. \u201cAlmaty used to be called Alma-Ata [the Russian name for the city],\u201d Raspopov told me at the apogee of our ascent. \u201cIt means \u2018father of apples\u2019,\u201d he added, before handing me an acid-green fruit the size of a child\u2019s fist.\n Zesty, sweet and deliciously crisp, it was not plucked from one of the nearly naked branches in front of us, which, when in season, bear apples of all shapes, sizes, flavours and textures \u2013 and, as Raspopov warned me, are rarely edible. Instead, this apple was a triumph of farming and cultivation, sadly the very same human endeavours that have ravaged the wild apple\u2019s natural habitats. This thought did not stop me from accepting another though, listening as Raspopov continued: \u201cKazakh people, Almaty people, they are very proud of the apple. It comes from here.\u201d\n  That pride is worn plainly for all to see throughout the city. Billboards bearing images of apples and Almaty\u2019s tagline, \u2018the city of [a] thousand colours\u2019, advertise nothing else but the famous fruit, injecting bold pops of red along otherwise grey highways. At the  A Kasteyev State Museum of Arts, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest art museum, apples appear in oil paintings and metal sculptures. On a larger and more public scale, murals depicting the fruit adorn the sides of buildings, and a giant granite apple-shaped fountain is a point of attraction at Kok Tobe mountain, one of the city\u2019s major landmarks. On my way to the cable car that takes visitors to its peak, I waited patiently in line to take a picture of a sunshine-yellow, Soviet-era car, stuffed full of plastic apples; the licence plate read \u2018I love Almaty\u2019.\n In the city\u2019s Green Bazaar, a farmers\u2019 market thronging with locals wrapped up against the chill, precarious towers of apples fastidiously organised according to hue, size and shape beckoned. Slices were deftly cut and devoured, offered with a steady stream of Russian \u2013 the lingua franca here \u2013 and gratefully received with a grin and a quiet \u201c spasiba\u201d (Russian for \u2018thank you\u2019, and about the sum of my knowledge of the language).\n  Just as the  Malus sieversii is the progenitor of modern apples, the Green Bazaar is ground zero for Kazakh cuisine. Each aisle presents another ingredient or element fundamental to the country\u2019s culinary history. There is the corner dedicated to horsemeat, from an animal so sacrosanct to the once-nomadic Kazakh people that it is considered a delicacy. Then there are countless Korean specialities, emblematic of the diaspora that led many Koreans to settle in Central Asia after being forcibly deported from Soviet Russia by Stalin in 1937, where they had fled following the breakdown of the Chosun dynasty in 1910. And there are pickles of almost every type imaginable, garnished with generous amounts of dill.\n Everything needed to make some of the country\u2019s signature dishes can be found here. Take  plov, a Central Asian rice dish that each country has adapted slightly. In Kazakhstan, the twist comes in the form of apples, which are added to the customary lamb, carrots and onions for a bit of additional sweetness.\n  But while the region has gladly accepted the  Malus domestica as its own, Kazakhstan\u2019s wild apples have been decidedly neglected.\n Malus sieversii is currently listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the  ICUN Red List (last assessed in 2007), with its population \u2018decreasing\u2019. Threats to the few remaining forests include residential and commercial development, livestock farming and deforestation. Moves have recently been made to preserve those that remain in the Trans-Ili Alatau foothills by Italy\u2019s  Slow Food foundation (which requires permits for visitors to enter the forest) with funding from  Cultures of Resistance Network.\n \u201cAgain and again, Slow Food has demonstrated that slowing down and paying attention to what we eat is not just a matter of the lifestyle choices of the affluent,\u201d said Iara Lee, director of Cultures of Resistance Network. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting models of agroecology that provide alternatives to environmentally destructive corporate farming, where profit becomes the driving concern. We need alternative models now more than ever.\u201d\n  Whether Vavilov foresaw such destructive human activity when he first visited Almaty is impossible to imagine. However, the visionary scientist made certain to collect  Malus sieversii seeds to protect the species and help prevent any future famine. He added them to his collection of 250,000 seeds, fruits and roots at one of  the world\u2019s first gene banks in Leningrad (now St Petersburg).\n During the  Siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1944, several botanists who worked at the gene bank chose to starve to death rather than eat the seeds stored there. Vavilov also died of starvation, imprisoned in the  gulag for falling out of favour with those in power. Thankfully, though, his legacy survives to this day. Now named the  Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (VIR), the gene bank is the only facility of its kind in Russia.\n \u201cWe collect, evaluate, maintain and use the collection according to Vavilov\u2019s theories and approaches,\u201d said Igor Loskutov, the head of the institute\u2019s rye, barley and oats genetic resources department. \u201cWe are working to prevent the loss of genetic diversity and genetic erosion. The VIR is important not only for Russia, but for the whole of mankind.\u201d\n Volk agreed: \u201cThe wild species in their native habitats will always be important, however, gene banks increase accessibility to the wild species and can serve as a partial backup in case of unexpected circumstances,\u201d she said.\n  In the case of Almaty\u2019s wild apple forests, let\u2019s hope those unexpected circumstances never arise.\n Back in the birthplace of the modern apple, the work of Vavilov, along with his courageous colleagues and his contemporaries, is a footnote in the story of a city whose identity is entwined with the fruit. To celebrate their work, and to satisfy a sudden craving, I stepped into a street-side stall and bought a mottled green-and-red apple. It was delicious.\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the car filled with apples as a Volga.
