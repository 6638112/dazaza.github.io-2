Now, as it continues its swift, relentless assault on Jo, Robin navigates the unthinkable</p><p>三年前，乔和他的妻子罗宾（Robin）分享了他们的故事：他患有早起的阿尔茨海默氏病。现在，随着罗宾继续对乔进行迅速，不懈的攻击，罗宾导航了难以想象的</p><p>      Robin Giles is waiting at the entrance of her London, Ont., apartment building when the little white bus pulls up at the curb. The door to the lift swings open to reveal her husband, Joël Aubin, sitting in his wheelchair, grinning broadly at her. His arms undulate through what looks like a slow-motion drumming routine, and he snaps his ﬁngers continuously.</p><p>      罗宾·吉尔斯（Robin Giles）正在白色公共汽车在路边停下来时，在她位于安大略省伦敦的公寓楼的入口处等待。电梯的门打开，露出坐在轮椅上的丈夫乔尔·奥宾，宽阔地对着她笑着。他的手臂在看起来像是慢鼓的例行动作中波动，然后不断地按手指。</p><p> The wheelchair lift has jammed, and after the bus driver makes several attempts to get it working, she asks Robin if she can get Jo—as he’s known to most everyone in his life—off the bus without his chair. “We can  try,” Robin says.</p><p> 轮椅升降机卡住了，公交车司机做了几次尝试使其工作后，她问罗宾是否可以让乔（他一生中大多数人都知道）让他不用椅子下车。 “我们可以尝试，”罗宾说。</p><p> She climbs aboard, takes Jo’s hands in hers and coaches him to stand and follow her down the aisle. As is nearly always the case when Robin is within range, Jo’s gaze rarely strays from her. She backs down the bus steps and talks him down them one at a time. It takes Jo a couple of tries to climb the high curb, then he settles into the wheelchair the driver has extracted through the rear door.</p><p> 她登上船，将乔的手握在手中，并指导他站起来并跟着她走下通道。罗宾（Robin）在射程之内几乎总是这种情况，乔的目光很少从她身上消失。她向后退了一步，每次都跟他说一声。 Jo经过几次尝试才能爬上高架路缘，然后他坐在驾驶员从后门拉出的轮椅上坐下来。</p><p> Jo turns to Robin. “Holy s–t!” he exclaims. Robin and the bus driver roar with laughter.</p><p> 乔转向罗宾。 “圣洁的！”他惊呼。罗宾和公共汽车司机大笑起来。</p><p> This is the routine—minus the glitch with the lift and Jo’s perfect comedic expletive—every weekday around 3 p.m. During the school year, when Robin is teaching, her dad meets the bus every day when Jo returns from a day program, and Robin comes home soon after.</p><p> 这是例行程序，每个工作日下午3点左右，都会消除升降机故障和乔的完美喜剧表演。在学年中，罗宾（Robin）任教时，乔（Jo）从日间计划返回后，她的父亲每天都会上公车，罗宾（Robin）不久便回家。</p><p> Four years ago, Jo was diagnosed with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, an extremely rare form caused by a genetic mutation slithering through his family tree. Jo watched his mother die of the same illness when he was a teenager. Even in this early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, Jo is a terrible rarity:  he was 37 years old when he was diagnosed.</p><p> 四年前，乔被诊断出患有显性遗传的阿尔茨海默氏病，这是一种极罕见的形式，由他的家谱中遗传的基因突变引起。乔十几岁时看着母亲死于同一病。即使是这种早发性的阿尔茨海默氏病，乔也非常罕见：他被诊断出时才37岁。 </p><p> READ THE FIRST STORY ABOUT JO:  Jo Aubin has Alzheimer’s. He’s 38.</p><p>阅读关于乔的第一篇小说：乔·奥宾（Jo Aubin）患有老年痴呆症。他38岁。</p><p> Now, Jo is 41 and Robin is 40, and they are navigating unthinkable territory. The “bastard monster,” as Robin sometimes calls Alzheimer’s, has been swift and relentless, but the assault has been particularly vicious in the last six months. Jo’s ability to speak has all but disappeared, his mobility is reduced to a slow, assisted shuffle around their apartment, and he requires hands-on help with every task of daily life, from dressing and brushing his teeth to eating and safely sitting down in a chair.</p><p> 现在，乔（Jo）是41岁，罗宾（Robin）是40岁，他们在不可思议的领域中航行。罗宾有时称阿兹海默氏症为“野兽怪物”，迅捷无情，但在过去的六个月中，袭击特别恶毒。 Jo的说话能力几乎消失了，他的活动能力降低到了缓慢，无所事事的状态，在他们的公寓周围，他需要动手的帮助，从日常的穿衣，刷牙到饮食和安全坐下，一把椅子。</p><p> So far, with the help of her family, the day program and the sheer force of her own will and devotion to Jo, Robin has managed to provide all his caregiving at home. Families of people with dementia land in different places on this issue, but to her, it’s beyond question that Jo is not here anymore; most everything that made him Jo has been stolen. “But it’s almost like an echo that’s left,” she says. “It’s like I want to take care of  this Jo because it’s honouring the real Jo.”</p><p> 到目前为止，在家人的帮助下，日程安排以及她对乔的热忱和奉献精神，罗宾成功地在家中提供了所有照顾。在这个问题上，痴呆症患者的家人分布在不同的地方，但是对她来说，毫无疑问的是，乔不再在这里了。使他成为乔的大部分事情都被偷了。她说：“但这几乎就像回声一样。” “这就像我要照顾这个乔，因为它是对真正的乔的尊重。”</p><p> When she’s forced to move Jo into a nursing home and Robin loses her ability to care every day for the echo of the man she married, that will mean he’s really gone. “Sometimes people very kindly say, ‘Oh, it will be better when Jo is living somewhere else.’ No, it won’t. That’s the part that people don’t understand. It won’t be better. It will be the worst part,” she says through sobs. “Because I don’t consider what I’m doing a negative thing.”</p><p> 当她被迫将乔搬到疗养院而罗宾（Robin）失去了每天照顾与已婚男人相呼应的能力时，这意味着他真的走了。 “有时候人们会很友好地说，‘哦，当乔住在其他地方时会更好。”不，不会。那是人们不理解的部分。不会更好这将是最糟糕的部分。”她抽泣地说。 “因为我不考虑自己在做负面的事情。”</p><p> But Robin knows a reckoning is imminent. And she also knows, because they talked about it many times before Jo lost the ability to have those conversations, that he despised the idea of going into a nursing home. In recent months, Robin felt compelled to put Jo on two waiting lists, but what haunts her is that he still seems so aware, she can’t imagine wrenching him from the peaceful, comfortable world they’ve built around him at home. There are still those fleeting moments—like his response to the ordeal of navigating the bus steps—when the old Jo resurfaces and announces himself with surprising clarity.</p><p> 但是罗宾知道一个迫在眉睫的事情。她还知道，因为在乔失去​​与这些人交谈的能力之前，他们多次谈论此事，所以他鄙视进入疗养院的想法。近几个月来，罗宾（Robin）感到不得不将乔列入两个候补名单，但令她困扰的是他似乎仍然很清楚，她无法想象要把他从他们在家周围建立的和平，舒适的世界中挣扎出来。当老乔重新出现并以惊人的清晰度宣布自己时，仍然存在那些短暂的时刻，例如他对导航公交台阶折磨的反应。</p><p> After saying goodbye to the bus driver, Robin guides Jo’s wheelchair onto the elevator and pushes the button for their floor.</p><p> 在与公交车司机道别后，罗宾将乔的轮椅引导到电梯上，然后按下按钮以使其到达地板。</p><p> “He’s not ready to go anywhere yet,” she says. She looks at Jo, then reaches over and ruffles his hair.</p><p> 她说：“他还没有准备好去任何地方。”她看着乔，然后伸手去over他的头发。 </p><p> More than two years before Jo was diagnosed, bizarre little glitches began to suggest something was terribly wrong. There were Christmas gifts that made no sense, problems with software he’d used for years or basic household tasks that went ignored. He saw his family doctor repeatedly, but medication and counselling—based on the assumption that the problem was depression or anxiety—went nowhere. Eventually, Jo was less able to teach high school—he was working at the same school as Robin—and their marriage frayed.</p><p>在乔被诊断出病情的两年多以前，奇怪的小故障开始暗示出一些严重错误。圣诞礼物毫无意义，他多年使用的软件出现问题，或者基本的家务劳动都被忽略了。他反复看过家庭医生，但基于问题是抑郁或焦虑的假设，药物治疗和咨询没有结果。最终，乔无法上高中，因为他和罗宾在同一所学校工作，因此婚姻破裂了。</p><p> Finally, Jo’s doctor referred him to a specialist, and in June 2014 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. A year after his diagnosis,   Maclean’s chronicled his story to that point. Jo—so articulate that it had always been a running joke among his friends—struggled slightly to make words do his bidding, but he explained what it was like to live with dementia. “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest,” he said. “And the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed.”</p><p> 最后，乔的医生将他转介给专科医生，并于2014年6月被诊断出患有老年痴呆症。诊断后一年，麦克林（Maclean）记述了他的故事。乔-口齿不清，这在他的朋友中间一直是在开玩笑-竭尽全力使自己的言语不合时宜，但他解释了患有痴呆症的感觉。他说：“这就像您要穿过一片森林。” “越是走进森林，树叶就会越来越大，您就会变得不知所措。”</p><p> Jo was adamant that he didn’t want to end up in a long-term care facility like the one in which he’d visited his mother—sometimes with Robin along for the ride when they began dating as teenagers in Kapuskasing, Ont.—and he hoped that Canada’s legalization of assisted death would allow him to avoid that. But when medical assistance in dying became law in 2016, excluded were “advance requests” that would have permitted people with dementia to set out terms for their death while they still had capacity to consent.</p><p> 乔坚定地表示，他不想在像他去过母亲的那家这样的长期护理机构中生活-有时他们会和罗宾一起骑车，因为他们在安大略省的卡普斯卡辛成年后开始约会。他希望加拿大将辅助死亡合法化将使他避免这种情况。但是，当2016年将死者的医疗救助成为法律时，“预先要求”被排除在外，这些要求将允许痴呆症患者在仍然有能力同意的情况下为他们的死亡制定条件。</p><p> Now, that dark forest Jo described is closing in. “In a lot of ways, it’s good that you don’t know what was coming, because if you knew, you would probably run away screaming,” Robin says. “But like everything else, it’s a progression where you look back and think, ‘I don’t know how we got here.’ ”</p><p> 现在，乔所描述的那片黑暗的森林正在关闭。“从很多方面来说，很好的是您不知道会发生什么，因为如果您知道，您可能会大声尖叫，”罗宾说。 “但是就像其他所有事情一样，这是一种回顾，让您回想起来，‘我不知道我们怎么到达这里。’”</p><p>  She thinks of life in chapters divided by school years. Last fall, Jo’s mobility was fine, and they could still go to the movies or grocery shopping, though she had to ensure he stayed with the cart. He could no longer speak in full sentences then, but he could tell her his preference if she gave him options.</p><p>  她以章节除以学年来思考生活。去年秋天，乔（Jo）的行动能力很好，尽管她必须确保他陪在推车上，但他们仍然可以去看电影或逛杂货店。那时他不能再用完整的句子说话了，但是如果她给他选择的话，他可以告诉她他的偏好。</p><p> Now, Jo’s communication is mostly reduced to quiet, monosyllabic responses to yes-or-no questions, along with the occasional full phrase, often in humorous contexts. This spring, he began to use a wheelchair at the day program and on the bus, because he was having trouble navigating steps and had fallen occasionally when he misjudged the location of a chair.</p><p> 现在，Jo的交流大多减少到对是或不是问题的安静，单音节的回答，以及偶尔的完整短语，通常是在幽默的背景下进行。今年春天，他开始在日间计划和公共汽车上使用轮椅，因为他在迈步时遇到困难，并且由于错误判断椅子的位置而偶尔摔倒。</p><p> Mostly, Jo looks like any guy in his early 40s and just like he always has, because even as he’s had to switch to comfortable clothing with no buttons or zippers, Robin has stuck close to his personal style; his wardrobe is still heavy on band T-shirts. But there’s a sort of veil in his gaze now and a relaxed softness in his facial features. When Instagram or Timehop present Robin with old photos, she can see some important source of light in Jo that’s gone now. A trip to the beach two years ago seemed ordinary, but when the photo appears, she can remember the day vividly: a postcard from another world where such things were possible. “It’s pretty devastating,” she says. “But also it’s nice to remember those times.”</p><p> 通常，乔看起来像40年代初期的任何人，而且就像往常一样，因为即使他不得不改穿没有纽扣或拉链的舒适衣服，罗宾仍坚持自己的个人风格。他的衣柜里仍然穿着乐队T恤。但是，他的目光现在已经蒙上了一层面纱，他的五官松散了。当Instagram或Timehop​​向Robin展示旧照片时，她可以看到Jo的一些重要光源，而这些光源现在已经不存在了。两年前去海滩旅行似乎很平常，但是当照片出现时，她可以清晰地记住这一天：来自另一个世界的明信片，在这种情况下，这种事情是可能的。她说：“这真是灾难性的。” “但是记住那些时间也很高兴。” </p><p>  Doctors often use the term “insight” to discuss whether a person with dementia is aware of their condition; some people come in for an appointment furious at a spouse who keeps insisting they’re losing track of things when they’re sure they’re not. Jo was acutely aware of his illness early on, and he and Robin talked about it often. “He was just frustrated by the hand he was dealt, and he was always, always worried about being a burden,” Robin says. “We would tell him, ‘You’re not.’ ” Jo stopped having those conversations about a year ago.</p><p>医生通常使用“洞察力”一词来讨论痴呆症患者是否意识到自己的病情。有些人对配偶感到愤怒，他们一直坚称自己在确定自己没有的时候会迷失方向。乔很早就意识到自己的病，所以他和罗宾经常谈论。罗宾说：“他只是被交易的手感到沮丧，他总是，总是担心自己会成为负担。” “我们会告诉他，‘你不是。’”大约一年前，乔停止了这些谈话。</p><p> Robin has continued to work full-time out of financial necessity and to maintain a little island of normalcy with a job she loves. There are two big reasons she’s been able to do that and still care for Jo at home: the McCormick Dementia Services day program, and her father, Kip Giles. “I literally don’t know what I would do without him,” Robin says.</p><p> 罗宾（Robin）出于经济上的需要继续全职工作，并通过自己喜欢的工作维持一点常态。她能够做到这一点并且仍然在家照顾乔的主要原因有两个：麦考密克痴呆症服务日计划和她的父亲基普·吉尔斯。罗宾说：“我真的不知道如果没有他我会怎么做。”</p><p> Three years ago, she called him in Kapuskasing and asked if he would consider moving in with them for the school year. “I immediately responded within a second or two, ‘Sure, of course,’” Kip says. Robin’s mother, Kathy, had died of complications from heart problems and pneumonia in January 2015, so Kip was on his own, and his reasoning for immediately saying yes matches Robin’s explanation for her devotion to Jo: when your family is in trouble, you’re there—that’s it. “Why sit up here, 1,100 km away and be by myself, when I know my daughter needs my help?” Kip says. “Realizing that I was going to be able to help in any way that I could made me feel like a parent.”</p><p> 三年前，她在卡普斯卡辛（Kapuskasing）打电话给他，问他是否考虑与他们一起度过学年。吉普说：“我很快就在一两秒钟内做出回应，‘当然可以。’罗宾（Robin）的母亲凯西（Kathy）因心脏病和肺炎在2015年因并发症而去世，因此基普（Kip）独自一人，他立即答应的理由与罗宾（Robin）对乔的虔诚的解释相符：当您的家人遇到麻烦时，在那里-就是这样。 “为什么当我知道女儿需要我的帮助时，为什么坐在这里，离我们1100公里呢？”基普说。 “意识到我将能够以任何使我像父母一样的方式提供帮助。”</p><p> One of the first times Kip met Jo was shortly after he and Robin started dating in high school, when there was a party going on next door. “I wouldn’t say he was completely inebriated, but he stumbled in the front door,” Kip says, chuckling. “My wife and I both turned and said, ‘Oh yeah?’” Jo’s home life was rough, so he more or less moved in with Robin’s family.</p><p> Kip第一次见到Jo的时候之一是在他和Robin在高中开始约会后不久，当时隔壁有一个聚会。 “我不会说他完全被激怒了，但他跌跌撞撞地走进了前门，”基普笑着说。 “我和我妻子都转过来说，‘哦，是吗？’”乔的家庭生活很艰难，所以他或多或少地搬到了罗宾一家。</p><p> Now, each fall when Kip returns to London after spending the summer at home, it’s jarring to see the changes. His first reaction is always anger at what’s happening to Jo, though he keeps it to himself. One of Robin’s frequent refrains is, “It is what it is.” And Kip thinks that makes sense, but even though he and his family are not at all religious, he can’t help wondering if there isn’t something more. “When you’re faced by a situation like we are, you have to think, is there some sort of plan going on here, some sort of test? Why did it happen to us?” he says. “And of course, the answers are still out there somewhere.”</p><p> 现在，每个秋天，当基普（Kip）在家里度过了一个夏天之后，当吉普（Kip）返回伦敦时，看到这些变化都是令人震惊的。他的第一反应始终是对Jo发生的事情感到愤怒，尽管他一直对自己负责。罗宾（Robin）经常拒绝的一句话是：“就是这样。”吉普认为这是有道理的，但是即使他和他的家人根本没有宗教信仰，他也不禁要问是否还有其他东西。 “当您面对像我们这样的情况时，您必须考虑，这里是否正在进行某种计划，某种测试？为什么发生在我们身上？”他说。 “当然，答案仍然存在。”</p><p> Another big piece of the puzzle Robin assembles for Jo’s care is the day program he attends every weekday, where his youth and exuberance have endeared him to the staff. Karen Johnson, director of McCormick Dementia Services, thought it was cool when baby boomer clients added the Rolling Stones and ABBA to the musical rotation. But then Jo showed up and they started playing Pearl Jam. “He’s been a gift,” says Johnson. “He’s been an absolute gift.”</p><p> 罗宾为乔的护理准备的另一个难题是他每个工作日参加的日间活动，在那里，他的青春和活力使他对工作人员产生了浓厚的兴趣。麦考密克痴呆症服务总监Karen Johnson认为，当婴儿潮一代的客户在音乐旋转中加入滚石乐队和ABBA时，这很酷。但是后来乔出现了，他们开始玩Pearl Jam。 “他是一个礼物，”约翰逊说。 “他是绝对的礼物。”</p><p>  When his mobility was better, he often strolled around the common area. One day, a diminutive older man tottered past Jo anxiously with his cane. Jo threw an arm around his shoulders, leaned down and planted a kiss on top of the man’s bald head. The staff lost it. Sarcasm is often one of the first things people with dementia struggle with, Johnson says, and some get deeply suspicious, unsure how to process subtle humour. Emotionally, Jo has landed in quite a sunny place, and it’s most often in smartass moments that he returns to himself and drops a choice one-liner, with brief, remarkable social clarity. “He’s a beautiful enigma,” Johnson says.</p><p>  当他的活动能力更好时，他经常在公共区域闲逛。有一天，一个身材矮小的老人Jo着拐杖焦急地经过了乔。乔用胳膊arm住了肩膀，俯下身，在那个男人的光头上栽下了一个吻。工作人员丢了它。约翰逊说，讽刺常常是痴呆症患者首先要面对的事情之一，有些人深感可疑，不确定如何处理微妙的幽默。从情感上讲，乔降落在一个阳光充足的地方，在聪明的时刻，他通常会回到自己身边，放弃选择单线的方式，而这种方式简明扼要，社交清晰。 “他是一个美丽的谜团，”约翰逊说。 </p><p> Staff thought he looked like a volunteer when he first came to the program. Even now, though he remains in his wheelchair and is much more an observer than a participant, Jo looks elementally wrong for the setting, like a grandchild who came to visit and got misplaced. His presence proved a startling education even for people who work in dementia care. “When Jo came, I started writing a letter to my kids: ‘If this happens to me, I want this, this, this, this, this,’ and they know where it is on my computer,” says Sue Rumble, the nursing care manager at McCormick, choking up. “Because I never thought [about it] before: What if, in two years, I get the diagnosis of dementia? What if I can’t tell my kids what I want?”</p><p>工作人员认为他第一次参加该计划时看起来像个志愿者。即使是现在，尽管他仍然坐在轮椅上，而且是观察者而不是参与者，但乔对于这个环境似乎还是有点不对劲，就像来探望并放错地方的孙子一样。他的出现甚至对痴呆症护理工作的人来说也是令人吃惊的教育。 “乔来时，我开始给孩子们写一封信：'如果这发生在我身上，我想要这个，这个，这个，这个，'，他们知道它在我的计算机上的位置，” Sue Rumble说，麦考密克（McCormick）的护理经理，让我感到窒息。 “因为我之前从未想过：如果两年后我得到痴呆症的诊断怎么办？如果我不能告诉孩子我想要什么怎么办？”</p><p> In January, as Jo’s needs increased markedly, Robin forced herself to put his name on the waiting list for McCormick Home, which is part of the same facility as the day program. That wait-list is years long, so it was a way for Robin to do the thing she dreaded without really doing it. And if by some miracle Jo did get a spot, Robin told herself it wouldn’t be so bad for him to go to a place that had already become his “second home.” Still, this step was so painful that Robin refused to think about it in the days afterward.</p><p> 一月份，由于Jo的需求显着增加，Robin强迫自己将自己的名字列入McCormick Home的候补名单，该名单与日间计划相同。那份等待清单很长，所以这是罗宾（Robin）做她不敢做的事情的一种方式。而且，如果乔有奇迹出现，罗宾告诉自己，去一个已经成为他的“第二故乡”的地方对他来说并不坏。尽管如此，这一步还是很痛苦的，以至于罗宾在后来的日子里都拒绝考虑。</p><p> The progress of Alzheimer’s forces constant little adjustments, but Robin and Kip have developed a daily routine they share for Jo’s care during the school year, and Robin and Jo navigate on their own during the summers. “It’s not hard to take care of Jo right now—it really isn’t,” Robin says. “It’s exhausting and it’s really sad, but it’s really not that hard.”</p><p> 阿尔茨海默氏病部队的进步几乎没有什么变化，但罗宾和基普已经制定了日常工作，他们在学年中要为乔的护理服务，而罗宾和乔在夏季要自己导航。罗宾说：“现在照顾乔并不难，实际上不是。” “这很累，真的很伤心，但实际上并不难。”</p><p> Jo has been incontinent for months, so after she wakes him up in the morning, Robin changes the special briefs he wears and helps him dress. She settles him at the centre of their L-shaped sofa and gives him his medication, then he watches TV while she prepares breakfast.</p><p> 乔已经失禁了好几个月，所以在早上将他叫醒后，罗宾改变了他穿着的特殊内裤并帮助他穿衣。她将他安放在L形沙发的中央，给他服药，然后他在看早餐的同时看电视。</p><p> They mostly watch the Comedy Network, because although Jo used to love horror movies, anything too aggressive or emotional bothers him now. Music is similar. “We found out the hard way we don’t put Peter Gabriel on for him,” says Robin, recalling the time they found Jo weeping in his headphones.</p><p> 他们大多看喜剧网络，因为尽管乔曾经喜欢看恐怖电影，但现在任何过于激进或激动的事情都困扰着他。音乐是相似的。罗宾回忆道：“我们发现了不让彼得·加布里埃尔（Peter Gabriel）身陷困境的艰难方法。”</p><p> He seems to quickly lose interest in any new television show, but the ones he watched before Alzheimer’s encroached— Seinfeld,  The Big Bang Theory and  Mike &amp; Molly—hold his attention, and he sometimes interacts with the characters. Anytime Donald Trump appears onscreen, Jo recoils and snarls with disapproval; he was aware enough when Trump was elected to have decided this is the appropriate response to the President.</p><p> 他似乎很快对任何新的电视节目都失去了兴趣，但是在阿尔茨海默氏症受到侵害之前，他观看过的那些电影包括：塞恩菲尔德（Seinfeld），大爆炸理论（Big Bang Theory）和迈克（Mike＆amp; amp; amp;）莫莉-保持注意力，有时与角色互动。每当唐纳德·特朗普出现在银幕上时，乔都会因不赞成而后坐并咆哮；他当特朗普当选已经决定，这是对总统相应的反应知道就够了。</p><p> Robin can instantly read every one of Jo’s reactions, and she explains them not in the manner of speaking on behalf of someone who cannot speak for themselves, but the way you might translate from one language to another. When she perches next to him on the couch to feed him or brush his teeth, the gentleness and respect of the gesture lies in how casual it is:  this is just what we do now, you and me together. No big deal.</p><p> Robin可以立即阅读Jo的每一个反应，她的解释不是以不能代表自己说话的人的说话方式，而是您可能从一种语言翻译成另一种语言的方式。当她在沙发上坐在他旁边吃饭或给他刷牙时，姿势的柔和和尊重在于它多么随意：这就是我们现在所做的，您和我在一起。没什么大不了的。 </p><p>  But the disease seems to progress in plateaus connected by sudden declines. By spring, Robin could not ignore the vicious slope of things. There was an entirely sleepless weekend over Easter when Jo reacted badly to a change in medication, and the crisis pushed her to look at other facilities. There was one, just outside London in Komoka, Ont., that caught her attention. The grounds were beautiful, and, when she drove by a few times before she could bring herself to make an appointment for a tour, something about it felt right.</p><p>但是这种疾病似乎在突然下降导致的高原上发展。到了春天，罗宾无法忽视事物的恶性倾向。复活节期间，整个周末都是一个完全不眠的周末，当时乔对用药的变化反应很差，危机迫使她去看其他设施。在伦敦郊外的安大略省科莫卡，有一个引起了她的注意。风景很美，当她开车开车几次要约好要去游览的时候，感觉很对。</p><p> But this time, putting Jo’s name on the list meant a concrete step toward the eventuality Robin still couldn’t contemplate. Because this nursing home is on the outskirts of the city, seniors who don’t drive have difficulty visiting, so the waiting list was only a few months long. If Jo’s name came up, Robin would have 24 hours to accept the spot and five days to move Jo in; if she declined because she didn’t think he was ready, they would close Jo’s file for 12 weeks and she’d have to start the application process again from the bottom of the list. Robin wanted every possible day that she and Jo could have together at home, but it was impossible to know where they’d be if she turned down a bed and his file was locked in purgatory for months. “That system is brutal,” she says. “You kind of have to be ready to pull the trigger.” Ontario’s Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care says the system is designed this way “to facilitate timely transfer and to avoid delays for other applicants.”</p><p> 但是这次，将乔的名字列入名单意味着这意味着朝着最终罗宾仍然无法考虑的方向迈出的具体一步。因为这个疗养院位于城市的郊区，所以不开车的老人去看病很困难，因此等待名单只有几个月的时间。如果乔的名字出现了，罗宾（Robin）将有24小时的时间接受邀请，还有五天的时间将乔搬进来。如果她因为不认为他准备好而拒绝了，他们将关闭Jo的档案12周，她将不得不从列表的底部重新开始申请程序。罗宾想要她和乔在一起的每一天，但如果她拒绝了床并且他的文件被锁在炼狱中几个月，就不可能知道他们会在哪里。她说：“该系统是残酷的。” “您必须准备好扣动扳机。”安大略省卫生和长期护理部表示，该系统的设计目的是“促进及时转移并避免其他申请人的延误。”</p><p> Robin pushed the decision away as long as she could, then finally put Jo’s name on the list at the end of June; there was no way to know how quickly the wait-list would move.</p><p> 罗宾（Robin）尽可能地推迟了决定，然后终于在6月底将乔的名字列入名单；没有办法知道等待名单会移动多快。</p><p> Right around that time, Shawn Veilleux, Jo’s best friend and the one person in his life who has been around longer than Robin, visited from Ottawa. He’s been rocked by Jo’s deterioration in recent months, but he still catches these brief glimpses of his friend. Shawn would say something deliberately stupid, and all of a sudden he’d see a look he knew well: a grimace of disapproval before Jo turned away, snickering. It was Grade 9 in Kapuskasing all over again. “I knew he got the joke,” Shawn says.</p><p> 大约在那个时候，乔的最好的朋友肖恩·维勒克斯（Shawn Veilleux）从渥太华拜访了他的生命中唯一一个比罗宾（Robin）长寿的人。近几个月来，Jo的衰落使他感到震惊，但他仍然瞥见了他朋友的这些简短印象。肖恩说了些故意的愚蠢之举，突然间他看到了他熟识的表情：在乔转身窃笑之前，他的不满情绪很糟糕。这是卡普卡星（Kapuskasing）的9年级。 “我知道他在开玩笑，”肖恩说。</p><p> During that summer visit, Shawn could tell Jo knew him immediately, and it took him a little while to recognize his wife, Chazza Currie. But it was clear Jo couldn’t quite place their sons, eight-year-old Luke and five-year-old Seth. Then, when they were getting ready to leave, Jo folded Luke into an enormous hug and kissed him. “Didn’t know his name, couldn’t say his name, but the hug he gave him was genuine,” Shawn says. “It was the only way he could say it, but it was, ‘I know who you are.’ ”</p><p> 在那个夏天的访问中，Shawn可以告诉Jo立即认识他，花了他一会儿才认识他的妻子Chazza Currie。但是很明显，乔不能完全把他们的儿子八岁的卢克和五岁的塞思放在一起。然后，当他们准备离开时，乔将卢克折成一个大大的拥抱，吻了他。肖恩说：“他不知道他的名字，也不能说他的名字，但是他给他的拥抱是真实的。” “这是他唯一可以说的方式，但是，‘我知道你是谁。’”</p><p> Robin can’t even look at Shawn when he’s around, because she can see the devastation in his face. Shawn sharpens Robin’s kitchen knives every time he visits, because there’s really nothing anyone can do—but you have to do something, so that’s what he does.</p><p> 罗宾（Robin）不在身边时甚至看不到肖恩（Shawn），因为她可以看到他脸上的毁灭。肖恩（Shawn）每次罗宾（Robin）到访时都会把菜刀削尖，因为实际上任何人都无能为力-但您必须做点什么，所以他就是这么做的。</p><p> Shawn is haunted by a conversation he and Jo had after the diagnosis. They were at a barbecue and the two of them went for a walk alone. Shawn says Jo asked him to promise he would never let him go into a nursing home, that he would help him find some way to end his life on his own terms. “That’s the hardest story to tell: a buddy asks you to help him die before he ever has to go into a place like that, but there’s nothing you can do,” Shawn says, weeping. “I told him, ‘I need you to tell me when you’re ready. How are you going to know?’ He said, ‘I don’t know, Shawn.’” They never spoke of it again.</p><p> 肖恩被诊断为他和乔的谈话困扰。他们正在烧烤，他们两个独自去散步。肖恩说乔要他保证他永远不会让他进入疗养院，他将帮助他找到某种方式以自己的方式结束他的生活。肖恩哭着说：“这是最难讲的故事：一个伙伴要你帮助他死，然后再去一个这样的地方，但是你无能为力。” “我告诉他，‘当你准备好时，我需要你告诉我。你怎么知道的？’他说，‘我不知道，肖恩。’”他们再也没有谈到它。 </p><p> A swift and merciful end to Jo’s life is also the only deliverance Robin can see from this choice she doesn’t want to make, and the eventuality Jo never wanted for himself. “It sounds horrible, but when I go in every morning, there’s a split second where I just hope that he’s passed away,” she says. “Every morning, I just think maybe he’s had, I don’t even know what—an aneurysm or a stroke, something that took him peacefully while he was sleeping.” It is appalling to her that Jo’s own wishes for the end of his life don’t appear to count for anything.</p><p>罗宾从他不想做出的选择中唯一可以看到罗宾从乔生活中得到的迅速而慈悲的结局，而乔最终从不想要自己。她说：“这听起来太可怕了，但是当我每天早上去的时候，有一瞬间我只是希望他去世。” “每天早晨，我只是想也许他有病，我什至不知道是什么—动脉瘤或中风，使他在睡觉时平静下来。”令她震惊的是，乔自己一生的愿望似乎没有任何意义。</p><p> In the early days after Jo was diagnosed, Robin tried a support group. But the format just wasn’t for her, and anyone close to her age was caring for a parent or grandparent with dementia. Instead, it has been in the experience of losing your spouse when your lives are just being constructed, not Jo’s specific diagnosis, where Robin has found fellow travellers. She clicked with an online community dubbed the Hot Young Widows Club, founded by a woman whose husband died when they were in their early 30s. Robin also has a close friend—one of her “Kap girls”—whose husband died of cancer a year and a half ago, and there, too, she’s found a connection.</p><p> 在诊断出Jo后的早期，Robin尝试了一个支持小组。但是这种格式并不适合她，与她年龄相近的人都在照顾患有痴呆症的父母或祖父母。取而代之的是，在刚刚建立生活时，会失去配偶，而不是乔（Robin）找到同伴的具体诊断。她点击了一个名为“ Hot Young Widows Club”的在线社区，该社区由一名妇女创立，她的丈夫在30多岁时就去世了。罗宾（Robin）还有一个密友-她的“踢女孩”之一-她的丈夫一年半前因癌症去世，在那里，她也找到了联系。</p><p>  Taryn Giles, Robin’s younger sister, is another key thread in their support system. When she ﬁrst met Jo as a self-described surly 12-year-old, they often sparred, but as time went on, they developed a close relationship based on unrelenting sarcasm and long conversations that were “most often ridiculous, but sometimes profound.” Taryn lives on a farm just outside London with her husband and visits often to help care for Jo, or simply hang out.</p><p>  罗宾的妹妹塔琳·吉尔斯（Taryn Giles）是他们支持系统中的另一个关键话题。当她初次见到乔时是一个自称为12岁的自以为是的人时，他们常常会保持镇定，但随着时间的流逝，他们基于不懈的嘲讽和漫长的交谈而建立了亲密的关系，这种交谈“最可笑，但有时却很深刻。 ”塔琳（Taryn）与丈夫住在伦敦郊外的一个农场，经常去看望以帮助照料乔，或者只是闲逛。</p><p> At first, when Jo would experience a sharp decline, Taryn didn’t know how to talk to him, so she would bury herself in a book at the other end of the couch. “I didn’t know how to reconcile the fact that I’m going to talk to you and you’re not going to be able to talk back to me, and that is the opposite of my relationship with Jo. So it was really, really hard at first,” she says. “And then I just thought, ‘Well, screw it. I feel worse if I’m sitting here ignoring you.’ ” So now, sh</p><p> 起初，当乔经历急剧下降时，塔琳不知道该如何与他交谈，因此她会将自己埋葬在沙发另一头的书中。 “我不知道该如何调和我将要与您交谈，而您将无法与我交谈的事实，这与我与乔的关系正好相反。因此，一开始确实非常非常困难。”她说。 “然后我只是想，‘好吧，拧紧它。如果我坐在这里无视我，我会感到更糟。’”所以，现在</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/i-am-mine-this-is-what-alzheimers-is-like-at-41/">https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/i-am-mine-this-is-what-alzheimers-is-like-at-41/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/阿尔茨海默氏症/">#阿尔茨海默氏症</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/alzheimer/">#alzheimer</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/罗宾/">#罗宾</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
