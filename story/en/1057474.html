Do they think the person will just never see it? Or do they not care when they&#39;re granted anonymity?” Two things about Tattle Life comments struck Lucy as different from the type of feedback she’d experienced on other social media sites. First, almost all of the comments came from people who described themselves as middle-aged women. “I typically get a few abusive messages a week, usually from men,” she told me. “But on Tattle Life I seem to rile up much older women.” Second was what Lucy described as the “sheer dedication” to “getting to the bottom” of highly personal elements of her life.  “They seem incredibly invested in a way I have never felt about a stranger,” she said. “In some ways, it was actually quite satisfying to read some of the comments – to think, well you don&#39;t know the full story, so you can scramble about looking for an ‘answer’ as much as you like. You’ll never get to the right one.” Lucy told me she’d occasionally thought about replying to set the record straight, but realised there is no way to truly satisfy her commenters.  When speaking to influencers off the record, many cited a common Tattle Life phenomenon pushed them to remain anonymous: they&#39;d been “doxxed” – users had figured out where they lived, and put that information in the public domain. Many influencers, particularly those who have achieved a certain level of fame and who integrate home content into their feeds, have fallen victim to doxxing. Eimear Varian Barry, an Irish influencer based in Surrey,  wrote for  Grazia last year about a link to her house sale being shared on the site. “[They] said that they’ll ‘come and visit’. I can&#39;t even tell you how terrifying it is to see that. It all makes me very paranoid,” she said. “I couldn&#39;t join the WhatsApp group for the school mums... I would get jumpy at cars driving past the house.” This kind of invasion by Tattle Life users was the biggest concern of the influencers I spoke to, followed by the mass of rumours and lies being shared about them on the site. Some told me they had seen whole facets of their life invented by users – from past jobs, to who they had dated, to what their relationship was like with their parents.  Ella, another influencer based in the south-east, told me she wasn&#39;t bothered by the false rumours on the site until she read some targeting her children.   “They make up things that I have never said or shared online and then act like they’ve actually happened,” she said. “How would they know these things if I don’t share them? Well, they don’t. It’s genuinely psychotic behaviour.   She adds that although she largely tries to pretend Tattle Life “doesn’t exist”, the harmful comments have led her to make changes in her life. “I was already private, but I have to share my personal life a lot less now,” she said.   “I have never experienced anything like what people say on Tattle.” *** The intense impact that Tattle Life can have on influencers’ mental health has resulted in unsuccessful campaigns being launched to try and have the site taken down. The most prominent of these was a  Change.org petition by the YouTuber Michelle Chapman (known as Mummy Chelle) which, in June 2019, called for a boycott and subsequent closure of the site.  “For the past six to eight months I’ve had nothing but relentless abuse, bullying, harassment, discrimination, even doxxing from this forum,” Chapman wrote, adding that “my looks, my health and more” had been mocked by users.  “They’ve even been really cruel about my young children. I have a few friends on YouTube who also have channels who’ve also been a victim to this. This can’t go on. This is affecting myself in a very big way and many others too.” At the time of writing, the petition has more than 59,000 signatures. But in May 2020, Chapman said she had “received a response from parliament” and shared a screenshot that only gave a limited view of the letter she had been sent. Her Tattle Life thread was not taken down, and Chapman wiped her entire social media presence from the internet. If Tattle Life is to remain online, is there at least a way for it to operate without harming the lives of the people it discusses? When I posed this question to Tattle Life, I did not receive a response.   “I don’t think Tattle Life can exist in a non-toxic way,” Ella told me. “The site isn’t regulated. They can just make up things about people’s lives. If they just had opinions or comments on what influencers had shared then that would be fine, but they don’t.” Lucy said she realised why the site would always be “pointless” after looking at another influencer&#39;s thread. “It struck me how nothing-y people&#39;s complaints were,” she said. “That she was being ‘too’ pregnant, that she didn&#39;t have a lightshade in her bedroom… I didn&#39;t read anything that she had done that was actually bad.” This was when Lucy decided that Tattle Life existed only for negativity’s sake. “I&#39;m not saying you should never be able to criticise someone, but if you don&#39;t have something nice to say, and the person hasn&#39;t done anything wrong, why say anything at all? “Tattle doesn&#39;t seem to be a site of valid critique,” she said. “It’s just critique in general.”</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2021/04/how-gossip-forum-tattle-life-became-most-toxic-place-internet">https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2021/04/how-gossip-forum-tattle-life-became-most-toxic-place-internet</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/奶油/">#奶油</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/life/">#life</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
