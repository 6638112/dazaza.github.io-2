Levin and  Douglas Blackiston, a member of his laboratory at the Allen Discovery Center of Tufts University, brought together nascent skin and muscle cells from a frog embryo and shaped the multicelled assemblies by hand. This sculpting process was guided by an algorithm developed by the computer scientists  Josh Bongard and  Sam Kriegman of the University of Vermont, which searched for simulated arrangements of the two cell types capable of organized movement. One design, for example, had two twitching leglike stumps on the bottom for pushing itself along.</p><p>去年年初，生物学家Michael Levin和他的同事们一睹了多才多艺的生活方物。 Levin and Douglas Blackiston是他在塔夫茨大学的Allen Discovery Centr的实验室成员，从青蛙胚胎中搭配了新生的皮肤和肌肉细胞，用手形成多型组件。该雕刻过程由计算机科学家Josh Bongard和佛蒙特大学的山姆·克里克曼开发的算法指导，从而寻找能够有组织运动的两种细胞类型的模拟布置。例如，一个设计在底部有两个抽搐的腿部腿部腿部腿部，用于推动自己。</p><p> The researchers let the cell clusters assemble in the right proportions and then used micro-manipulation tools to move or eliminate cells — essentially poking and carving them into shapes like those recommended by the algorithm. The resulting cell clusters showed the predicted ability to move over a surface in a nonrandom way.</p><p> 研究人员让细胞集群以正确的比例组装，然后使用微操纵工具来移动或消除细胞 - 基本上戳并雕刻它们以算法推荐的形状。所得到的细胞簇显示出以非粗糙方式在表面上移动的预测能力。</p><p> The team  dubbed these structures xenobots. While the prefix was derived from the Latin name of the African clawed frogs ( Xenopus laevis) that supplied the cells, it also seemed fitting because of its relation to  xenos, the ancient Greek for “strange.” These were indeed strange living robots: tiny masterpieces of cell craft fashioned by human design. And they hinted at how cells might be persuaded to develop new collective goals and assume shapes totally unlike those that normally develop from an embryo.</p><p> 该团队称为这些结构Xenobots。虽然前缀是从提供细胞的非洲爪青蛙（Xenopus Laevis）的拉丁名称，但它也似乎是因为它与Xenos，古希腊语“奇怪”的关系。这些确实是奇怪的生活机器人：人类设计塑造了细胞工艺的微小杰作。他们暗示了如何说服细胞如何开发新的集体目标，并假设形状完全不同于那些通常从胚胎发育的形状。</p><p> But that only scratched the surface of the problem for Levin, who wanted to know what might happen if embryonic frog cells were “liberated” from the constraints of both an embryonic body and researchers’ manipulations. “If we give them the opportunity to re-envision multicellularity,” Levin said, then his question was, “What is it that they will build?”</p><p> 但这只会划伤莱文的问题，如果从胚胎身体和研究人员操纵的限制从胚胎蛙细胞“释放”，那么可能知道可能发生了什么。 “如果我们给他们重新设想多线子的机会，”莱文说，那么他的问题是，“他们会建立什么？”</p><p>  Some of those answers are now being unveiled in work  appearing today in  Science Robotics. It describes a new generation of xenobots — ones that took shape on their own, entirely without human guidance or assistance.</p><p>  其中一些答案现在正在今天在今天出现的工作中亮相。它描述了一代新一代的Xenobots  - 完全没有人类指导或援助的塑造。</p><p> At a glance, these xenobots might be mistaken for other microscopic aquatic animals — amoebas or plankton or  Giardia parasites — swimming here and there with apparent agency. Some move in orbit around particles in the water, while others patrol back and forth as though on the lookout for something. Collections of them in a petri dish act like a community, responding to one another’s presence and participating in collective activities.</p><p> 这一目了然，这些Xenobots可能被误认为是其他微观水生动物 -  Amoebas或Plankton或Giardia Parasites  - 在这里和那里游泳，有明显的机构。在水中的颗粒周围的轨道上有一些移动，而其他人则巡逻，好像在寻找某些东西。他们在培养皿中的汇集就像一个社区一样，响应彼此的存在并参与集体活动。</p><p> When he shows movies of these spontaneously grown xenobots to other biologists and asks them to guess what they are, Levin said that “People say, ‘It’s an animal you found in a pond somewhere.’” They are astounded when he reveals that “it’s 100%  Xenopus laevis.” These microscopic entities are utterly unlike any stage in the normal development of a frog.</p><p> 当他向其他生物学家展示这些自发的Xenobots的电影并要求他们猜测他们是什么，莱文说“人们说，”这是一个你在某处的池塘里发现的动物。“当他透露”它的时候，他们被震惊了100％Xenopus laevis。“这些微观实体完全不同于青蛙正常发展中的任何阶段。 </p><p> The xenobots are turning some conventional views in developmental biology upside down. They suggest that the frog genome doesn’t uniquely instruct cells about how to proliferate, differentiate and arrange themselves into a frog body. Rather, that’s just one possible outcome of the process that the genomic programming permits.</p><p>Xenobots正在颠倒的发育生物学中转变一些常规观点。他们表明青蛙基因组并不唯一地指示关于如何增殖的细胞，分化并将自己排成蛙体。相反，这只是基因组编程许可的过程的一个可能结果。</p><p>  For the evolutionary biologist  Eva Jablonka of Tel Aviv University, who was not involved in the work, xenobots are nothing less than a new type of creature — one “defined by what it does rather than to what it belongs developmentally and evolutionarily.” She suspects the findings might illuminate the very origins of multicellular life.</p><p>  对于Tel Aviv大学的进化生物学家Eva Jablonka没有参与工作，Xenobots不仅仅是一种新型的生物 - 一个“由它所做的事情而不是它的发育方式所属的东西。”她怀疑调查结果可能会照亮多细胞生命的起源。</p><p> Levin believes that his cell-bots disclose something profound about how cells and development work. The results seem to imply that individual cells have a kind of decision-making capacity that creates a palette of possible bodies they could build — constrained and guided by the genome but not defined by it. Rules operating above the level of genes appear to specify biological form, and the way we see them embodied in xenobots can tell us something about how they operate. Ricard Solé, a complex systems theorist at Pompeu Fabra University in Spain, said that the new experiments “open a whole new window to interrogate development — and more generally, novel forms of complex life.”</p><p> Levin认为，他的手机机器人披露了关于细胞和发展工作的深切性。结果似乎暗示各个细胞具有一种决策能力，可以创建可能的身体的调色板，它们可以由基因组构建和引导而不是由其定义。在基因水平上方的规则似乎指定了生物学形式，以及我们看到它们在Xenobots中所体现的方式可以告诉我们他们如何运作的事情。西班牙庞普布布拉大学的复杂系统理论家RicardSolé表示，新实验“开辟了一个全新的橱窗，以询问发展 - 以及更加繁体的复杂生活形式。”</p><p> It’s certainly not just about frogs. “If the organization we see in xenobots is the basic state of multicellular animal organization,” said Jablonka, then she anticipates that human cells will behave in the same way. Someday, if we can learn and guide the effect of these rules, Levin thinks, we might be able to achieve things that our cells don’t seem able to manage on their own, such as the regeneration of limbs.</p><p> 这肯定不仅仅是青蛙。 “如果我们在Xenobots中看到的组织是多细胞动物组织的基本状态，”Jablonka说，然后她预计人体细胞将以同样的方式行事。总有一天，如果我们能够学习和指导这些规则的效果，莱文认为，我们可能能够实现我们的细胞似乎无法自行管理的事情，例如四肢的再生。</p><p>  The experiments described in the paper published today were remarkably simple. The same team of researchers, along with Emma Lederer of Levin’s lab, removed cells from developing frog embryos that had already specialized into epithelial cells and left them to develop in clusters on their own without the rest of the embryo, which normally provides the signals that guide cells to become the “right” type in the “right” place.</p><p>  今天发表的论文中描述的实验非常简单。与Levin的实验室的Emma Lederer一起去除已经专门用于上皮细胞的青蛙胚胎并将它们留在其余的胚胎中，而没有胚胎的其余部分，因此左侧的胚胎胚胎删除了细胞，而没有胚胎，这通常提供信号引导单元格成为“正确”位置的“右”类型。</p><p> What the cells did first was unremarkable: They gathered into a ball, composed of dozens of cells or a few hundred. That kind of behavior was already well known and reflects the tendency of skin cells to make their surface area as small as possible after tissue damage, which helps wounds to heal.</p><p> 细胞首先是不起眼的：它们聚集成球，由数十个细胞或几百个组成。这种行为已经众所周知，并且反映了皮肤细胞在组织损伤后尽可能小的皮肤细胞使其表面积小的趋势，这有助于伤口愈合。</p><p> Then things got weird. Frog skin is generally covered with a protective layer of mucus that keeps it moist; to ensure that the mucus covers the skin evenly, the skin cells have little hairlike protrusions called cilia, which can move and beat. We have them, too, on the lining of our lungs and respiratory tract, where their beating motion helps sweep away dirt in the mucus.</p><p> 然后事情变得奇怪。青蛙皮肤通常覆盖有粘液的保护层，使其保持湿润;为了确保粘液均匀地覆盖皮肤，皮肤细胞具有很少的毛发突起，称为纤毛，可以移动和搏动。我们也有他们的肺部和呼吸道的衬里，他们的殴打运动有助于扫除粘液中的污垢。 </p><p>  But the frog skin cell clusters quickly began to use their cilia for a different purpose: to swim around by beating in coordinated waves. A midline formed on the cluster, “and the cells on one side row to the left and those on the other side row to the right, and this thing takes off. It starts zooming around,” Levin said</p><p>但青蛙皮肤细胞集群很快开始使用他们的纤毛以不同的目的：通过在协调的波浪中跳动来游泳。在群集中形成的中线，“和一个侧排的细胞向左，另一侧排的右侧，这件物品起飞。莱文说，它开始放大缩小</p><p> How does the xenobot decide where to draw the midline? And what even “tells” it that doing this would be useful? That’s not yet clear.</p><p> Xenobot如何决定在哪里绘制中线？甚至“告诉”这一点是有用的吗？这还没有清楚。</p><p> But these entities don’t just move; they seem responsive to their environment. “They’ll sometimes go straight, sometimes in circles,” Levin said. “If there’s a particle in the water, they’ll circle it. They will do mazes — they can take corners without bumping into anything.”</p><p> 但这些实体不仅仅是移动;他们似乎对他们的环境敏锐。 “他们有时会直截了当地，有时在圈子里，”莱文说。 “如果水中有颗粒，他们将圈出来。他们会做迷宫 - 他们可以在没有碰撞的情况下拿角。“</p><p> He added, “I’m quite certain they do a lot of things we don’t even recognize yet.”</p><p> 他补充道，“我确信他们做了很多事情，我们甚至没有认识到。”</p><p>  Jablonka thinks that most animal developmental biologists won’t be surprised by the outcome of experiments like this — but will kick themselves for not having looked for it. “They would probably say, ‘Yes, of course! Why did we not do this simple experiment before?’” she said. Solé suspects others might have accidently stumbled on similar observations, but “thought it was a mistake, or simply impossible.”</p><p>  Jablonka认为，大多数动物发育生物学家对这样的实验结果不会感到惊讶 - 但会因为没有寻找它而踢自己。 “他们可能会说，'是的，当然！为什么我们之前没有做这个简单的实验？“”她说。别先嫌疑人可能会偶然地偶然地偶然地搞定了类似的观察，但“思想是一个错误，或者根本不可能。”</p><p> Or it might have just been overlooked — because most developmental research only aims to reveal how whole organisms or parts of them grow under normal or mildly manipulated conditions, Jablonka said. But Levin’s work has a new goal, she says: “Constructing an autonomous creature that has nothing to do with the specific form of the [original] organism.”</p><p> 据说，它可能刚刚被忽视了 - 因为大多数发展研究旨在揭示在正常或温和的操纵条件下，他们的整个生物体或其部分在正常或温和的情况下。但莱文的工作有一个新的目标，她说：“构建一个与[原始]有机体的具体形式无关的自治生物。”</p><p> Xenobots normally live for about a week, subsisting on the nutrients passed down from the fertilized egg they came from. But in rare cases, by “feeding” them with the right nutrients, Levin’s team has been able to keep xenobots active for more than 90 days. The longer-lived ones don’t stay the same but begin to change, as though they are on a new developmental path — destination unknown. None of their incarnations look anything like a frog as it grows from an embryo to a tadpole.</p><p> Xenobots通常生活在一周内，依靠从他们来自的受精卵中传递的营养素。但在极少数情况下，通过用正确的营养成分“喂养”它们，Levin的团队已经能够将Xenobots保持活跃超过90天。较长的人不保持同样但开始改变，好像他们是一个新的发展路径 - 目的地未知。由于它从胚胎到蝌蚪的生长，他们的化身都看起来像一只青蛙。 </p><p>  Media reports of the earlier handmade xenobots both reveled in and worried about the idea of miniature robots made from living matter. Might they breed and develop minds of their own? In truth, neither possibility was remotely likely: The cells could survive in a nutrient medium, but they couldn’t replicate into new xenobots. And they didn’t have any nerve cells that might act like a mind.</p><p>媒体报道早期的手工Xenobots曾经启发，担心了由生物的微型机器人的想法。他们可能会培养和发展自己的思想吗？在真理中，既不远程可能会很可能：细胞可以在营养培养基中存活，但它们无法复制到新的Xenobots中。他们没有任何可能像思想一样的神经细胞。</p><p> But even though xenobots have no nervous system, that doesn’t mean the cells can’t communicate with one another.  One cell might release a chemical that sticks to surface proteins on another cell, triggering a biochemical process within the recipient. This type of cell signaling happens constantly during embryonic development, and it’s one way that neighboring cells control one another’s fate — the type of tissue each cell ultimately becomes. Adhesive proteins enable cells to attach to one another and to sense mechanical forces and deformations. In developing embryos, mechanical cues like this may also guide to become the right tissue type.</p><p> 但即使Xenobots没有神经系统，那并不意味着细胞不能彼此通信。一个细胞可能释放粘附在另一个细胞上的表面蛋白质的化学物质，触发受体内的生化过程。这种类型的细胞信号在胚胎发育期间不断发生，并且是邻近的细胞控制彼此的命运的一种方式 - 每个细胞最终变为组织的类型。粘合剂蛋白能够使细胞彼此连接并感测机械力和变形。在开发胚胎中，这样的机械提示也可能导致成为合适的组织类型。</p><p>  Levin thinks that cells also commonly communicate electrically — that this isn’t just a property of nerve cells, although they may have specialized to make good use of it. In a xenobot, “there’s a network of calcium signaling,” Levin said — an exchange of calcium ions like that seen between neurons. “These skin cells are using the same electrical properties that you would find in the neural network of a brain.”</p><p>  莱文认为，细胞也通常电气通信 - 这不仅仅是神经细胞的财产，尽管它们可能是专门的利用它。在Xenobot中，“有一个钙信号通信网络，”莱文说 - 一种在神经元之间看到的钙离子的交换。 “这些皮肤细胞正在使用与大脑的神经网络中找到相同的电气性质。”</p><p> For example, if three xenobots are set spaced apart in a row, and one of them is activated by being pinched, it will emit a pulse of calcium that, within seconds, shows up in the other two — “a chemical signal that goes through the water saying that someone just got attacked,” Levin said.</p><p> 例如，如果三个Xenobots设置在一行间隔开，并且通过捏合将其中一个激活，则会发出钙的脉冲，即在几秒钟内显示在另外两个 - “通过的化学信号中出现“水说，有人刚被攻击，”莱文说。</p><p> He thinks that intercellular communications create a sort of code that imprints a form, and that cells can sometimes decide how to arrange themselves more or less independently of their genes. In other words, the genes provide the hardware, in the form of enzymes and regulatory circuits for controlling their production. But the genetic input doesn’t in itself specify the collective behavior of cell communities.</p><p> 他认为，细胞间通信创建了一种压缩形式的代码，并且该细胞有时可以决定如何或多或少地独立于其基因来安排自己。换句话说，该基因以酶和调节电路的形式提供硬件，用于控制其生产。但遗传投入本身并不规定了细胞社区的集体行为。</p><p> Instead, Levin thinks that it programs cells with an ensemble of tendencies that produce a repertoire of behaviors. Under the normal conditions of embryogenesis, those behaviors follow a certain path toward forming the organisms we know. But give the cells a very different set of circumstances, and other behaviors and new emergent shapes will appear.</p><p> 相反，Levin认为IT程序与产生行为曲目的倾向的集合。在胚胎发生的正常情况下，这些行为遵循一定程度的途径，形成我们所知道的生物。但是，将细胞带来一个非常不同的环境，以及其他行为和新的紧急形状将出现。</p><p> “What the genome provides for the cells is some mechanism that allows them to undertake goal-directed activities,” Levin said — in effect, a drive to adapt and survive.</p><p> “基因组提供的细胞是一些机制，使他们能够进行目标导向的活动，”莱文说 - 实际上是一种适应和生存的驱动器。 </p><p>  One such goal that Levin and his colleagues think they have seen is known as  infotaxis, a push for cells to maximize the amount of information they get from their neighbors. Cells may also seek to minimize “surprise,” the chance of encountering something unexpected. The best way to do that, Levin says, is to surround yourself with copies of yourself. Some other goals are based on pure mechanics and geometry, such as minimizing the surface area of a cluster.</p><p>Levin和他的同事认为他们所看到的一个这样的目标被称为Infotaxis，推动细胞最大化他们从邻居的信息量。细胞也可能试图尽量减少“惊喜”，这是遇到意想不到的事情的机会。 Levin说，最好的方法，是用自己的副本环绕自己。其他一些目标是基于纯机制和几何形状，例如最小化簇的表面积。</p><p> The genomic programs for the pursuit of these goals, he says, are very ancient. Indeed, a reversion to something like ancestral behavior from before cells figured out how to work together may emerge in cancers — where cells adopt a potentially lethal mode of organizing themselves that sets proliferation ahead of cooperation.</p><p> 他说，为追求这些目标的基因组计划非常古老。实际上，从细胞弄清楚如何共同努力的祖先行为中可能出现在癌症中的祖先行为的回归 - 如果细胞采用潜在的致命模式，可以在合作方面组织的含有扩散。</p><p> If that’s right, then the variety of body shapes and functions in natural organisms is not so much the result of specific developmental programs written into their genomes, but of tweaks to the strengths and tendencies of these single-cell behaviors, which may come from both the genome and the environment.</p><p> 如果这是对的，那么自然生物体中的各种身体形状和功能并不是那么多于其基因组的特定发育计划的结果，而是对这些单细胞行为的强度和趋势来说可能来自两者基因组和环境。</p><p> Jablonka guesses that the behaviors on display in the xenobots are probably “something like the most basic self-organization of a multicellular animal-cell aggregate.” That is, they are what happens when both the constraints on form and the resources and opportunities provided by the environment are minimal. “It tells you something about the physics of biological, developing multicellular systems,” she said: “how sticky animal cells interact.” For that reason, she thinks the work might hold clues to the emergence of multicellularity in evolutionary history.</p><p> Jablonka猜测Xenobots上显示的行为可能是“像多细胞动物细胞聚集体中最基本的自我组织的东西。”也就是说，它们是在形式和环境提供的资源和机会都很短的情况下发生的事情。 “它告诉你一些关于生物，开发多细胞系统的物理学的物理，”她说：“粘性动物细胞如何互动。”因此，她认为这项工作可能会阻碍进化历史中多线性的出现线索。</p><p> Solé agrees with that. “One of our dreams in the study of synthetic complexity is to be able to move beyond the actual repertoire of life forms that we can see around us, and to explore alternatives,” he said. The fossil traces of simple animals that began to evolve before the Cambrian era, more than about 540 million years ago, give only the vaguest hints of how multicellularity arose through the interactions of single-celled organisms.</p><p> 别人同意了这一点。 “我们在综合复杂性研究中的一个梦想是能够超越我们可以看到我们身边的实际曲目，并探索替代方案，”他说。在寒武纪时代之前开始发展的简单动物的化石痕迹只超过5.4亿年前，只给出多晶粒度如何通过单细胞生物的相互作用产生的模糊暗示。</p><p>  That cells might be programmed to collectively “compute” their own ways solutions to growth and form, rather than for their genome to prescribe them, makes sense in evolutionary terms, because it means that the collective goals of the cells in a tissue remain resilient to disturbance. There’s no need to hard-wire a contingency plan into the genome for every injury or challenge the tissue might face, because the cells will spontaneously revert to the right course. “What you have is organs and tissues that have very specific large-scale goals, and if you try to deviate them off of that, they will come back,” Levin said.</p><p>  该细胞可能被编程为共同“计算”他们自己的方式解决方案，而不是为他们的基因组规定，以传教术语进行意义，因为这意味着组织中细胞的集体目标保持弹性骚乱。对于每次伤害或挑战组织可能面临的伤害或挑战，没有必要将应急计划硬化为基因组，因为细胞将自发地恢复到正确的过程中。 “你拥有的是有的器官和组织，具有非常具体的大规模目标，如果你试图偏离其中，他们会回来，”莱文说。</p><p> This robustness against disruption seems to be borne out by the fact that the xenobots can regenerate from damage. “Once they’ve developed this new body, they have some ability to maintain it,” Levin said. In one experiment, a xenobot was cut almost in two, its ragged halves opened up like a hinge. Left to itself, the hinge shut again and the two fragments rebuilt the original shape. Such a movement requires substantial force applied at the hinge joint — a situation skin cells would not normally encounter, but which they can apparently adapt to.</p><p> 这种防止破坏的稳健性似乎由Xenobots可以从损伤中再生而引用。 “一旦他们开发了这个新的身体，他们就有一些能力保持它，”莱文说。在一个实验中，Xenobot几乎连续切割，其撕裂的一半像铰链一样打开。留给自己，铰链再次关闭，两个片段重建原始形状。这种运动需要在铰链接头处施加的大量力 - 一种情况皮肤细胞通常不会遇到，但它们显然可以适应。 </p><p>  Whether the xenobots really are on a new and distinct developmental path remains unclear at this point.  Christoph Adami, a microbiologist at Michigan State University, suggests that the xenobots’ development of cilia, for example, might not reflect some novel “decision” but rather just an automatic response to the mechanical forces acting on the cell clusters. He thinks that more work, perhaps by tracking changes in gene expression, will be required to establish what’s happening.</p><p>Xenobots是否真的在新的，不同的发展路径上仍然不清楚。密歇根州立大学的微生物学家Christoph Adami表明，例如，尖嘴蛋白的发展可能不会反映一些新颖的“决定”，而是仅仅是对作用在细胞集群上的机械力的自动响应。他认为更多工作​​，也许通过跟踪基因表达的变化，将需要建立发生的事情。</p><p> But Levin said that the idea of cells collectively deciding on and remembering goals is supported by experiments that he and his colleagues conducted previously on  Xenopus tadpoles. To become a frog, a tadpole has to rearrange its face; the genome was thought to hard-wire a set of cell movements for every facial feature. “I had doubts about this story,” Levin said, “so we made what we call Picasso tadpoles. By manipulating the electrical signals, we made tadpoles where everything was in the wrong place. It was totally messed up, like Mr. Potato Head.”</p><p> 但莱文表示，通过实验支持统称和记住目标的细胞的想法是通过先前在Xenopus Tadpoles进​​行的同事的实验支持。要成为青蛙，蝌蚪必须重新排列它的脸部;对于每个面部特征，基因组被认为是硬线的一组电池运动。 “我对这个故事疑惑，”莱文说：“所以我们在古老的毕加索蝌蚪叫什么。通过操纵电信号，我们制造了蝌蚪，在错误的地方。这是完全搞砸了，就像马铃薯头先生一样。“</p><p>  And yet from this abstract rearrangement of tadpole features, normal frogs emerged. “During metamorphosis, the organs take unusual paths that they don’t normally take, until they  settle in the right place for a normal frog face,” Levin said. It’s as if the developing organism has a target design, a global plan, that it can achieve from any starting configuration. This is far different from the view that cells are “following orders” each step of the way. “There’s some way the system is storing a large-scale map of what it’s supposed to build,” Levin said. That map is not in the genome, however, but in a kind of collective memory of the cells themselves.</p><p>  然而，从这个摘要重新排列蝌蚪特征，普通的青蛙出现了。 “在变态期间，器官采取了不寻常的路径，他们通常不采取，直到他们在正确的地方定居正常的青蛙面孔，”莱文说。就好像开发的有机体具有目标设计，一个全球计划，它可以从任何开始配置实现。这与该观点相比，电池是“遵循命令”的每个步骤。 “系统在某种程度上存储了它应该构建的大规模地图，”莱文表示。然而，该地图不是在基因组中，而是在细胞本身的集体记忆中。</p><p> If, however, you totally reconfigure the cells, it seems you can change the map. The next step is to work out what the rules are that create the new map — so that we can control it and build what we want. “We know very little about the plasticity of developmental programs,” Adami said. “Our thinking has been shaped by a few well-studied organisms and genes, like worms, flies and sea urchins. But there is likely an iceberg of ancient potential pathways under every tip.”</p><p> 但是，如果您完全重新配置单元格，则似乎您可以更改地图。下一步是解决规则是创建新地图的规则 - 以便我们可以控制它并构建我们想要的内容。 “我们对发展方案的可塑性知之甚少，”阿达米说。 “我们的思想已经被一些学习的生物和基因塑造，如蠕虫，苍蝇和海胆。但是每个尖端都有可能的古代潜在途径的冰山。“</p><p> Fundamentally, Levin says, no one yet know what factors specifically induce cells to multiply and spread in a flat layer, gather into a dense mass, make an organlike structure … or grow into a mobile “bot.” The challenge now is to discover the rules and to learn how to apply them for desired outcomes. “We need to learn how cells themselves encode whatever pattern they’re supposed to build, and then to rewrite that target morphology,” he said.</p><p> 从根本上说，莱文说，没有人知道特别诱导细胞乘以和蔓延在平面层中的哪些因素，聚集成致密的质量，制造有器官般的结构......或生长到移动“机器人”中。现在的挑战是发现规则，并学习如何申请期望的结果。 “我们需要了解细胞本身如何编码他们应该构建的任何模式，然后重写目标形态，”他说。</p><p>  He thinks the outcomes might include the possibility of regenerating tissue and limbs — a trick that some amphibians, such as axolotls, are adept at but which we can’t do. “To me, this is the answer to the problem in regenerative medicine that we’re going to hit very soon,” he said. We’re very good at switching genes and manipulating molecules in cells, but we don’t know how to turn those dials to make fingers, eyes or limbs. “It’s entirely not obvious how you get changes to 3D anatomy by manipulating that lowest genetic level,” Levin said. “We need to learn how cells themselves encode whatever pattern they’re supposed to build, and then to rewrite that target morphology and let the cells do their thing.”</p><p>  他认为结果可能包括再生组织和肢体的可能性 - 一些两栖动物（例如Axolotls）的技巧擅长，但我们不能做到这一点。 “对我来说，这是再生医学问题的答案，我们将很快击中，”他说。我们非常擅长切换基因和操纵细胞中的分子，但我们不知道如何将这些拨号转为手指，眼睛或四肢。 “通过操纵最低遗传水平，您如何通过操纵最低遗传水平来改变3D解剖学的变化完全不明显。” “我们需要了解Cells本身如何编码他们应该构建的任何模式，然后重写该目标形态，让细胞完成他们的事情。”</p><p> The potential for cells to find their way to body plans was dramatically illustrated recently with a report that when some sea slugs become heavily infected with parasites,  their head separates from the body through self-induced decapitation and then regrows an entire new body within a few weeks. It’s tempting to see this as just an extreme case of regeneration, but that perspective leaves some profound questions hanging.</p><p> 最近，细胞找到他们对身体计划的途径的潜力，最近有一份报告显示，当一些海粘罩感染寄生虫时，它们的头部通过自我诱导的斩波与身体分开，然后在几个内部注另一个新的身体周。看到这一点只是一个极端的再生的案例很诱人，但这透视留下了一些深刻的问题。 </p><p>  “First, where does the information for the anatomy it’s trying to regenerate come from?” Levin asked. “It’s easy to say ‘genome,’ but we now know from our xenobots that there is extreme plasticity, and cells are actually willing and able to build very different bodies.”</p><p>“首先，它试图再生的解剖学信息来自哪里？”莱文问道。 “这很容易说'基因组，'，但我们现在从我们的Xenobots中知道，有极端的可塑性，细胞实际上是愿意的，能够建立非常不同的身体。”</p><p> The second question, he says, is how regeneration knows when to stop. “How do cells know when the ‘correct’ final shape has been produced, and they can stop remodeling and growing?” he asked. The answer is critical for understanding the unruliness of cancer cells, he thinks.</p><p> 他说，第二个问题是再生是如何停止的。 “当生产”正确“的最终形状时，细胞如何知道，他们可以停止重塑和生长？”他问。他认为，答案对于了解癌细胞的无魅力至关重要。</p><p> Levin’s group is now studying whether adult human cells (which lack the versatility of embryonic cells) display a similar ability to assemble into “bots” if given the chance. Preliminary findings suggest that they do, the researchers said.</p><p> 莱文群现在正在研究成人人类细胞（缺乏胚胎细胞的多功能性）如果赋予机会，可以显示相似的组装成“机器人”的能力。研究人员说，初步调查结果表明他们所做的。</p><p>  In their paper, Levin and his colleagues discuss the potential of xenobots as “living machines” that could be used as microscopic probes or deployed in swarms to perform collective operations such as cleaning up watery environments. Adami, however, remains to be convinced that the Tufts team understands enough to begin to do this. “They have not shown that you can design these things, that you can program them, that they are doing anything that is not ‘normal’ once you release the mechanical constraints,” he said.</p><p>  在他们的论文中，莱文及其同事讨论了Xenobots作为“活着机器”的潜力，可以用作微观探针或部署在群体中，以进行清理水利环境的集体运营。然而，阿达米仍然相信，塔夫茨团队了解足以开始这样做。 “他们没有表明你可以设计这些东西，你可以编程它们，因为你在释放机械约束后，他们正在做任何不是'正常'的东西。”他说。</p><p> Levin is undeterred, however, and thinks that the ramifications of xenobots for fundamental science may ultimately go far beyond their biomedical or bioengineering applications, to any collective system that exhibits an emergent design not specifically encoded in its parts.</p><p> 然而，Levin不再是未知的，并认为Xenobots对基本科学的影响最终可能远远超出其生物医学或生物工程的应用，以任何集体制度，这些系统展示出于其零件中没有专门编码的紧急设计。</p><p> “I think this is bigger than even biology,” Levin said. “We need a science of where larger-scale goals come from. We’re going to be surrounded by the internet of things, by swarm robotics, and even by corporations and companies. We don’t know where their goals come from, we’re not good at predicting them and we’re certainly not good at programming them.”</p><p> “我认为这比甚至是生物学，”莱文说。 “我们需要一个较大规模目标来自的科学。我们将被群体的机器人互联网包围，甚至是由公司和公司的互联网包围。我们不知道他们的目标来自哪里，我们不擅长预测它们，我们当然不擅长编程它们。“</p><p> Solé shares that wider vision. “This work is remarkable in particular for how much it reveals about the generative potential of self-organization,” he said. He feels it might broaden our view of how nature creates its endless forms: “One thing we also know well is that nature constantly tinkers with biological matter and that different functions or solutions can be achieved by different combinations of pieces.” Maybe an </p><p> 援市股票更广泛的愿景。 “这项工作尤其适用于自组织的生成潜力，”他说。他觉得它可能会扩大我们对自然创造无尽形式的观点也许A. </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cells-form-into-xenobots-on-their-own-20210331/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/cells-form-into-xenobots-on-their-own-20210331/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/形成/">#形成</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/form/">#form</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/细胞/">#细胞</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
