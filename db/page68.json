Now one researcher has found a collection of bugs that allow him to hack ATMs\u2014along with a wide variety of point-of-sale terminals\u2014in a new way: with a wave of his phone over a contactless credit card reader.\n Josep Rodriguez, a researcher and consultant at security firm IOActive, has spent the last year digging up and reporting vulnerabilities in the so-called near-field communications reader chips used in millions of ATMs and point-of-sale systems worldwide. NFC systems are what let you wave a credit card over a reader\u2014rather than swipe or insert it\u2014to make a payment or extract money from a cash machine. You can find them on countless retail store and restaurant counters, vending machines, taxis, and parking meters around the globe.\n Now Rodriguez has built an Android app that allows his smartphone to mimic those credit card radio communications and exploit flaws in the NFC systems&#39; firmware. With a wave of his phone, he can exploit a variety of bugs to crash point-of-sale devices, hack them to collect and transmit credit card data, invisibly change the value of transactions, and even lock the devices while displaying a ransomware message. Rodriguez says he can even force at least one brand of ATMs to dispense cash\u2014though that  &#34;jackpotting&#34; hack only works in combination with additional bugs he says he&#39;s found in the ATMs&#39; software. He declined to specify or disclose those flaws publicly due to nondisclosure agreements with the ATM vendors.\n &#34;You can modify the firmware and change the price to one dollar, for instance, even when the screen shows that you&#39;re paying 50 dollars. You can make the device useless, or install a kind of ransomware. There are a lot of possibilities here,&#34; says Rodriguez of the point-of-sale attacks he discovered. &#34;If you chain the attack and also send a special payload to an ATM&#39;s computer, you can jackpot the ATM\u2014like cash out, just by tapping your phone.&#34;\n Rodriguez says he alerted the affected vendors\u2014which include ID Tech, Ingenico, Verifone, Crane Payment Innovations, BBPOS, Nexgo, and the unnamed ATM vendor\u2014to his findings between 7 months and a year ago. Even so, he warns that the sheer number of affected systems and the fact that many point-of-sale terminals and ATMs don&#39;t regularly receive software updates\u2014and in many cases require physical access to update\u2014mean that many of those devices likely remain vulnerable. &#34;Patching so many hundreds of thousands of ATMs physically, it&#39;s something that would require a lot of time,&#34; Rodriguez says.\n  As a demonstration of those lingering vulnerabilities, Rodriguez shared a video with WIRED in which he waves a smartphone over the NFC reader of an ATM on the street in Madrid, where he lives, and causes the machine to display an error message. The NFC reader appears to crash, and no longer reads his credit card when he next touches it to the machine. (Rodriguez asked that WIRED not publish the video for fear of legal liability. He also didn&#39;t provide a video demo of a jackpotting attack because, he says, he could only legally test it on machines obtained as part of IOActive&#39;s security consulting to the affected ATM vendor, with whom IOActive has signed an NDA.)\n  The findings are &#34;excellent research into the vulnerability of software running on embedded devices,&#34; says Karsten Nohl, the founder of security firm SRLabs and a well-known firmware hacker, who reviewed Rodriguez&#39;s work. But Nohl points to a few drawbacks that reduce its practicality for real-world thieves. A hacked NFC reader would only be able to steal mag-stripe credit card data, not the victim&#39;s  PIN or the data from EMV chips. And the fact that the ATM cashout trick would require an extra, distinct vulnerability in a target ATM&#39;s code is no small caveat, Nohl says.\n  But security researchers like the late IOActive hacker Barnaby Jack and the team at Red Balloon Security have been able to uncover those ATM vulnerabilities for years, and have  even shown that hackers can remotely trigger ATM jackpotting remotely. Red Balloon CEO and chief scientist Ang Cui says that he&#39;s impressed by Rodriguez&#39;s findings and has little doubt that hacking the NFC reader could lead to dispensing cash in many modern ATMs, despite IOActive withholding some details of its attack. &#34;I think it&#39;s very plausible that once you have code execution on any of these devices, you should be able to get right to the main controller, because that thing is full of vulnerabilities that haven&#39;t been fixed for over a decade,&#34; Cui says. &#34;From there,&#34; he adds, &#34;you can absolutely control the cassette dispenser&#34; that holds and releases cash to users.\n  Rodriguez, who has spent years testing the security of ATMs as a consultant, says he began exploring a year ago whether ATMs&#39; contactless card readers\u2014most often sold by the payment technology firm ID Tech\u2014could serve as an in-road to hacking them. He began buying NFC readers and point-of-sale devices from eBay, and soon discovered that many of them suffered from the same security flaw: They didn&#39;t validate the size of the data packet sent via NFC from a credit card to the reader, known as an application protocol data unit or APDU.\n  By using a custom app to send a carefully crafted APDU from his NFC-enabled Android phone that&#39;s hundreds of times larger than the reader expects, Rodriguez was able to trigger a &#34;buffer overflow,&#34; a decades-old type of software vulnerability that allows a hacker to corrupt a target device&#39;s memory and run their own code.\n When WIRED reached out to the affected companies, ID Tech, BBPOS, and Nexgo didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment, and the ATM Industry Association declined to comment. Ingenico responded in a statement that due to its security mitigations, Rodriguez&#39;s buffer overflow technique could only crash its devices, not gain code execution on them, but that, &#34;considering the inconvenience and the impact for our customers,&#34; it issued a fix anyway. (Rodriguez counters that he&#39;s doubtful that Ingenico&#39;s mitigations would actually prevent code execution, but he hasn&#39;t actually created a proof of concept to demonstrate this.)\n Verifone, for its part, said that it had found and fixed the point-of-sale vulnerabilities Rodriguez highlighted in 2018, long before he had reported them. But Rodriguez argues that this only demonstrates the lack of consistent patching in the company&#39;s devices; he says he tested his NFC techniques on a Verifone device in a restaurant last year and found that it remained vulnerable.\n  After keeping many of his findings under wraps for a full year, Rodriguez plans to share the technical details of the vulnerabilities in a webinar in the coming weeks, in part to push customers of the affected vendors to implement the patches that the companies have made available. But he also wants to call attention to the abysmal state of embedded device security more broadly. He was shocked to find that vulnerabilities as simple as buffer overflows have lingered in so many commonly used devices\u2014ones that handle cash and sensitive financial information, no less.\n &#34;These vulnerabilities have been present in firmware for years, and we\u2019re using these devices daily to handle our credit cards, our money,&#34; he says. &#34;They need to be secured.&#34;\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

From hardware like the  Xbox Adaptive Controller, to  legislation that requires all communication options in online multiplayer to be as accessible as possible, to  freely available in-depth development guidelines for interested developers, games have never been more inclusive to disabled players. As the 2010s come to a close, a game called  Deafverse is trying to reach another milestone by becoming the first fully American Sign Language (ASL)-accessible game. Developed through the National Deaf Center (NDC) in Austin, Texas,  Deafverse is a browser-based ongoing-narrative adventure about navigating the world as a deaf teenager. Designed first and foremost (but not exclusively) for classroom use, the game seeks to educate and enlighten players about deaf culture through collaborative play and discussion. Players learn about the real-life challenges of deafness in a safe and sincere way designed by and for the deaf community.\n Deriving inspiration from choose-your-own-adventure books and games,  Deafverse merges aspects of point-and-click sci-fi and fantasy stories from the 1980s and &#39;90s with contemporary standards for accessibility to make something that is as educational as it is engaging.\n  &#34;In deaf culture, we have a very strong culture of telling our own community stories,&#34; Kent Turner, gaming coordinator at the National Deaf Center, told Ars Technica. &#34;We love to share stories, and it&#39;s a very small community, and our language is unique to us. So I wanted to develop a game that really incorporated those values of deaf culture.&#34;\n Turner, a former teacher with a master&#39;s degree in game-based learning, derived much of  Deafverse&#39;s design from his experience &#34;gamifying&#34; his classroom. There, he used a points system akin to  Dungeons &amp; Dragons to reward students for completing homework, doing well in class, and so on.\n Deafverse marries that idea with a story-centered approach akin to  King&#39;s Quest and  The Secret of Monkey Island. Players face common hurdles among the deaf community\u2014like requesting an interpreter or just speaking up for themselves in a tough situation\u2014and examine the issues involved through branching conversations and intuitive puzzles.\n &#34;&#39;Choose your own adventure&#39; is a model of storytelling that, historically, has been text-based, and American Sign Language isn&#39;t really deliverable, so to speak, over text,&#34; Turner said. &#34;So, we have an actor who uses sign language and narrates the story and events using ASL. It also provides the text version as well, for those [who are] not fluent in sign language. We also have audio voiceover as another accessibility feature, and that really overlaps with the gaming features of picking your own adventure and figuring out what happens next in the story.&#34;\n    Empowerment is the central focus\u2014encouraging players to make their own choices and learn from the consequences. Even if things go sideways, the game creates an opportunity to discuss the hows and whys of what happened with other players, playing into the word-of-mouth storytelling that&#39;s at the foundation of deaf community.\n  Deafverse went through a range of beta tests conducted through partnered schools before the first episode, about self-advocacy, became publicly available in September 2019. Built and rebuilt based on student feedback, the game is now effectively in its third iteration, and its increased interactive elements and animations make the universe feel immersive.\n &#34;In terms of building and designing the game with different layers of gaming concepts, we got some inspiration from stories like  The Matrix,&#34; Turner explains. &#34;You know, plugging into and experiencing things in that world, but then you have to come out and come back into the real world. So that&#39;s given us some ideas about how to build out into the future.&#34;\n  Although  Deafverse is primarily designed for deaf teenagers of high school age (in service of the NDC&#39;s primary goal of supporting deaf young people&#39;s transition into active employment), much of its subject matter is useful for anyone who wants to learn about deafness. Using federal funding through the NDC, the  Deafverse development team was able to cast a wide net for research on ways deaf young people are and are not succeeding after their teen years. The findings, Turner says, were cross-checked against a set list of broad learning outcomes to create a game that teaches lessons while still being true to life.\n But  Deafverse is also about connecting to those who may feel isolated. Pop culture&#39;s rare, usually inaccurate depictions of deafness are often not much help in that regard.\n &#34;My two favorite examples are, first, people who can&#39;t sign or they use a different version of sign language that we can&#39;t understand,&#34; William Albright, senior software engineer on  Deafverse, said of some common &#34;deafness in pop culture&#34; tropes. &#34;And then, when a deaf character is chatting with other people in a movie, and the person is hearing and they speak back to the deaf person. It&#39;s not what really happens in our life. If we can&#39;t hear them, if a hearing person speaks to me, I sort of shut down and run away because it&#39;s not that easy for me to engage with them as they often show in a movie or a TV show.&#34;\n As a way of addressing these issues,  Deafverse is serving as a benchmark of sorts for overall accessibility within the games industry. While standards are much better than they were, there&#39;s still a lot of room for improvement, not least in basic aspects like uniformity among subtitling and options available. Making  Deafverse has involved incorporating as many variations of sign language as possible, so anyone who speaks it at any level can use it.\n    &#34;We didn&#39;t want to use American Sign Language the entire time because we didn&#39;t want people to feel like, &#39;Oh, I don&#39;t sign like so and so,&#39; or &#39;I don&#39;t sign at all, I can&#39;t play,&#39;&#34; Albright said. &#34;We want them to feel like they have options of accessibility, and we&#39;ve really tried to keep that key. When advertising the game, if you look at the video, it does look like it&#39;s only for kids who were born and raised in the deaf community, went to a deaf school, and only used sign language their whole life. So we try to counter that by really emphasizing that it&#39;s accessible to all hearing levels and all different types of diverse deaf people within our community.&#34;\n  Although games are becoming more and more common within a school setting (major releases like   Minecraft and   Assassin&#39;s Creed have\u00a0 specific  versions available for teaching), there&#39;s still a looming skepticism toward their wider usage in education.  Deafverse, however, has been met with open arms by teachers relieved to have such a wide-ranging resource. Students, meanwhile, have almost uniformly reported a growth in confidence in surveys conducted after playing the game. More than that, there are also small but valuable knock-on effects for players, like understanding proper signing etiquette by following the narrator.\n  &#34;I&#39;m continually surprised at how positive people are receiving  Deafverse,&#34; Turner said. &#34;I mean, we get so many positive comments about how great it is... The teachers are really able to take it and run with it, and often students will play  Deafverse on their own.&#34;\n With the first episode of  Deafverse a success, a total of four more episodes have been planned, each tackling one of the NDC&#39;s &#34;pre-employment transitional services.&#34; The second, due sometime in 2020, will tackle entering the workplace; it will look at interviewing and resume writing while building on the communication &#34;soft skills&#34; from the first episode.\n Developers are currently ironing out remaining minor issues with the engine and getting the upcoming achievement systems for tracking progress ready for roll out. In the long term, the team hopes to be able to make the jump to mobile and deepen the branching storylines that can make  Deafverse feel so dynamic.\n &#34;Right now, the story is told through very basic &#39;if&#39; and &#39;then&#39; statements,&#34; Turner explained. &#34;It&#39;s pretty basic, as we have it. We do want to add some more features like conditional branching... so when a player makes a decision here it&#39;ll impact something later down in the story again.&#34;\n &#34;The branching increase[s] the value for players, who can play it repeatedly and have all kinds of different things happen because of one choice,&#34; Albright added. &#34;The game [currently] feels more linear: you make one decision and it will tell you to keep navigating down the same road. So we are planning to branch out and give people different results, so not everybody comes to the same conclusion at the end.&#34;\n &#34;We&#39;re looking forward to providing that versatile experience for our players as we move through the development.&#34;\n Special thanks to interpreter Amanda Katz who was an immense help in translating many of the interviews in this piece from sign language.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 16:20:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u7834\u574f,deaf", "title": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u7834\u574f\u804b\u54d1\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u624b\u8bed ", "title_en": "Breaking deaf stereotypes and normalizing sign language through gaming", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/breaking-deaf-stereotypes-and-normalizing-sign-language-through-gaming/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6e38\u620f", "\u7834\u574f", "deaf"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "85b1266df273129ace3d3bfc97d54df4.jpg", "infoid": 1068194, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u75be\u75c5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8f89\u745e\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5236\u9020\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5236\u9020\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u82d7\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8fc71200\u540d\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u7ea630\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f500\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u514d\u75ab\u7684\u597d\u5904\u6781\u5927\u5730\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caC.D.C\u7684\u987e\u95ee\u3002\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba12\u5c81\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5fc3\u808c\u708e\uff0c\u5fc3\u808c\u708e\u75c7;\u5fc3\u5305\u708e\uff0c\u5fc3\u810f\u5468\u56f4\u886c\u91cc\u7684\u708e\u75c7\u3002\u5728MRNA\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5242\u91cf\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u5242\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u6bd4\u5973\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\n \u4f46\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u7f55\u89c1 -

Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may have caused heart problems in more than 1,200 Americans, including about 500 who were younger than age 30, according to data reported on Wednesday by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Still, the benefits of immunization greatly outweighed the risks, and advisers to the C.D.C. strongly recommended  vaccination for all Americans 12 and older.\n The heart problems reported are myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining around the heart. The risk is higher after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine than after the first, the researchers reported, and much higher in men than in women.\n But overall, the side effect is very uncommon \u2014 just 12.6 cases per million second doses administered. The researchers estimated that out of a million second doses given to boys ages 12 to 17, the vaccines might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases, but would prevent 5,700 infections, 215 hospitalizations and two deaths.\n Agency researchers presented the data to members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations on vaccine use in the United States. (The scientists grouped pericarditis with myocarditis for reporting purposes.)\n Most cases were mild, with symptoms like fatigue, chest pain and disturbances in heart rhythm that quickly cleared up, the researchers said. Of the 484 cases reported in Americans under age 30, the C.D.C. has definitively linked 323 cases to vaccination. The rest remain under investigation.\n \u201cThese events are really very rare, extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Brian Feingold, an expert on heart inflammation in children at the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh. \u201cThat needs to be taken in context with illness and morbidity and mortality related to Covid.\u201d\n  Separately, more than a dozen federal and professional medical organizations said in a joint statement on Wednesday that myocarditis \u201cis an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration nonetheless is expected to add a warning to the vaccines\u2019 packaging regarding possible heart problems in the coming days.\n Federal researchers on Wednesday also presented early safety data regarding the six million doses of vaccines administered to children ages 12 to 15. The side effects \u2014 usually fatigue and pain at the injection site \u2014 were similar to those observed in young people ages 16 to 25.\n \u201cTo date, the Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have demonstrated a high degree of safety,\u201d said Dr. Matthew F. Daley, a senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Colorado and a member of the advisory committee.\n The C.D.C. advisers met as the Biden administration  publicly acknowledged that it expected to fall short of its goal of getting 70 percent of Americans at least partly vaccinated by July 4. The shortfall, officials said on Tuesday, resulted in part from reluctance among younger Americans to be immunized.\n About two out of every 100,000 people aged 15 to 18 \u2014 about two-thirds of them male \u2014 are hospitalized each year with myocarditis, according to data presented at the meeting. Patients with the most severe cases may require mechanical support, like a ventilator, or a heart transplant.\n Even those with mild symptoms must refrain from exercise for about six months after recovery. It\u2019s unclear what typically causes the condition, or why it\u2019s more common in young men than in women.\n  The first cases of myocarditis linked to coronavirus vaccines were reported in Israel, mostly among young men aged 16 to 19. Israel recorded 148 cases from December to May, 95 percent of them mild.\n In the United States, too, myocarditis has been more common in men and boys: Up to 80 percent of cases diagnosed after the second dose were in males. There has also been a clear age difference, with the side effect clustered in individuals in their late teens and early 20s.\n About 318 million coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered in the United States as of June 21, and 150 million people are considered to be fully protected. Most of the myocarditis symptoms emerged within about four days of the first or second dose.\n \u201cWe have clear evidence here of onset for the vaccinated cases within the first week,\u201d said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a vaccine expert at the C.D.C. who presented the new data. There is also a dose effect, he said, adding, \u201cThe rates are higher for both vaccines after dose two.\u201d\n The vast majority of patients with the side effect fully recover, noted Dr. James de Lemos, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who reported  one of the first cases in January.\n Covid-19 itself may cause heart problems in young people. A large  study of collegiate athletes showed that 2.3 percent of those who had recovered from Covid-19 had heart abnormalities consistent with myocarditis.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be manifold more common to get heart muscle inflammation from getting Covid than you would from getting a vaccine, even in young men,\u201d Dr. de Lemos said.\n More than 4,000 children infected with the coronavirus developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which includes heart symptoms. Some children have also died, while none have died from vaccination, Dr. Feingold noted. \u201cYou can say no to the vaccine, but you\u2019re assuming other risks.\u201d\n The C.D.C. recommends vaccination for all Americans over age 12. But on Wednesday, officials suggested that anyone who develops myocarditis after the first dose should defer a second dose until they discuss the risks with a health care provider.\n The C.D.C.\u2019s recommendations may influence decisions about whether to immunize children younger than 12 as vaccines become available for that age group. Some experts have questioned whether the benefits to children outweigh the potential risks, given the low odds of developing serious illness from the virus in young children.\n Still, the agency  reported this month that the number of Covid-19-related hospitalizations among adolescents in the United States was about three times higher than hospitalizations linked to influenza over three recent flu seasons.\n The overall number of infections has steeply dropped since January, but as more adults have been vaccinated, the proportion of children in the total has risen. About one-third of new infections reported in May were in Americans aged 12 to 29, and 316 deaths have been recorded in this age group since April.\n Vaccination is becoming an even more urgent priority, given more contagious variants of the coronavirus now circulating in the United States, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine safety committee, said in an interview.\n \u201cWe are not close to being near where we need to be\u201d in terms of the percentage of Americans who should be vaccinated, said Dr. Offit, who is also a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to head into winter when you\u2019re going to have a generally undervaccinated population.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25

Carroll\u2019s  Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d This question from Alice is at once a critique of her sister\u2019s pictureless tome, and a paving the way for the delight of words and images to follow. Indeed, John Tenniel\u2019s famous illustrations \u2014 for both the first edition of  Wonderland and its sequel  Through the Looking-Glass \u2014 have become integral to how we experience the story, in both books and  film. Tenniel, however, was not the first to illustrate the tale. That honor belongs to Carroll himself, whose original manuscript of the story (then titled \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d) is littered with thirty-seven of his own sepia-ink drawings. It seems this entwining of word and image \u2014 so important to the published version \u2014 was there from the beginning.\n Carroll&#39;s illustrations are slightly more reserved and less caricatured than John Tenniel\u2019s efforts so familiar to us today. In a vertical sketch that stretches out across the manuscript\u2019s right margin, spanning part of the indelible  mushroom scene, Alice\u2019s \u201cimmense length of neck\u201d assumes the form of a fuzzy tree trunk, capped with an almost  Pre-Raphaelite face, which gazes solemnly across the distant forest below. It&#39;s an oddly mournful countenance that recurs throughout. On the final page Carroll stuck a small photographic portrait of Alice Liddell (1852\u20131934) the family friend for whom he wrote (and drew) the story. Underneath the photograph is his attempt at a drawn portrait, with which he seems to have been displeased enough to cover with the photograph. Did he intend his heroine to look like Alice herself? It&#39;s not so easy to tell, though there is something of her look in his drawings.\n  The manuscript was presented to Alice so that she could revisit a story that he had improvised while rowing her and her sisters down one of Oxford\u2019s rivers.  As Carroll put it:\n Many a day had we rowed together on that quiet stream. . .and many a fairy tale had been extemporized for their benefit. . .yet none of these many tales got written down: they lived and died, like summer midges, each in its golden afternoon. . .\n While  unsubstantiated theories about the author\u2019s consumption of hallucinogenic compounds or  undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy are often trotted out as an explanation for the fictional Alice\u2019s phantasmagoric adventure, the other-worldly pleasures of these idle river trips seem to be a more likely source for the unparalleled visions of Wonderland. As Walter de la Mare observed, when writing about Carroll, \u201cafternoons in July, if fair and cloudless, are apt to be narcotics. The rhythm of sculling quiets the mind and sets the workaday wits drowsing\u201d.\n In addition to his clerical and mathematical pursuits, Carroll was as much a visual artist as a storywriter. In 1899, there was enough unpublished material for his nephew, Stuart Carroll Collingwood, to publish   The Lewis Carroll Picture Book, a collection of lesser-known texts, many complete with illustrated margins, alike in kind to \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d. Carroll was also  a talented photographer, keeping a darkroom in his College rooms. As  Diane Waggoner has argued, \u201cCarroll\u2019s photographs of children equaled the status of his children\u2019s books. His pictures served as a vehicle for the emotional and imaginative appeal of. . . childhood\u201d. A similar set of concerns and proclivities can be glimpsed in his original  Alice illustrations, which capture both the playful innocence and unselfconscious sincerity of childhood adventure.\n When Carroll decided to publish his story, excising certain family-specific details from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d, he chose John Tenniel (1820\u20131914) as illustrator, well-known for his cartoons in the magazine  Punch. Tenniel based several of his drawings, engraved onto  woodblock electrotypes by the Dalziel brothers, off of Carroll\u2019s own illustrations, but found the Oxford Don to be rather exacting with his interventions. Some of this scrupulousness was warranted: Tenniel introduced  several interpretive ambiguities into his illustrations, few of which escaped Carroll\u2019s notice, or his time-consuming calls for correction. And, after working on  Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, Tenniel initially declined to illustrate  Through the Looking-Glass (1871), which scholars have read as a sign that the collaboration between author and illustrator had temporarily soured.\n Below you can browse all thirty-seven of Carroll\u2019s manuscript illustrations, which carry bittersweet associations. On one hand, it is a joy that they have survived. It was treasured by Alice Liddell until she was forced to auction the text in 1928 to pay for her husband\u2019s death duties. Thankfully, it was eventually purchased, after passing through the possession of several intermediary owners, by American benefactors, who donated the manuscript to the British Library as a symbol of a special, postwar relationship between the nations in 1948. On the other hand, these illustrations conjure an unfathomable depth of creative loss  when we remember that the Alice stories were just a few of the many \u201coriginal, funny, starling, and brilliant\u201d tales that Carroll extemporized for children, most of which were never transcribed or drawn at all, only given over to the wind and river on idle summer afternoons.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 14:55:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "carroll,\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d", "title": "Lewis Carroll\u7684\u63d2\u56fe\u201cAlice\u5728\u5730\u4e0b\u7684\u5192\u9669\u201d\uff081864\u5e74\uff09 ", "title_en": "Lewis Carroll\u2019s Illustrations for \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d (1864)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/carroll-illustrations-for-alice-undergound", "via": "", "real_tags": ["carroll", "\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "644c38c28dd7eb882af1caa3d838dd0e.jpg", "infoid": 1068189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\uff1a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u5c40\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u6218\u58eb\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u963b\u6b62\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u3002\n D3Fend\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8865\u5145\u4ef2\u88c1\u8d5b\uff06amp;

Whereas ATT&amp;CK focuses on standardizing the way cyber warriors understand and talk about offense, D3FEND focuses on cyber defenses.\n  Together, the frameworks provide cyber warriors with a common understanding of cyber concepts and a standardized vocabulary to use when talking about them, which should facilitate clearer communication for sharing information and coordinating defensive operations both in and between organizations.\n ATT&amp;CK can be used to build threat models, as well as cyber kill chains of actual incidents, to include adversaries\u2019 behaviors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), in part because ATT&amp;CK is based on real-world threats.\n  Likewise, D3FEND can be used to develop cyber defenses  by \u201cillustrat[ing] the complex interplay between computer network architectures, threats, and cyber countermeasures\u2026 illuminat[ing] previously-unspecified relationships between defensive and offensive methods.\u201d\n Because D3FEND is so detailed, it can serve as a useful guide for architecting, designing, and implementing cyber defenses.\n    D3FEND is based, in part, on 500 countermeasure patents from the last two decades, according to its website. Notably, however, D3FEND and ATT&amp;CK are vendor-agnostic frameworks, which can be applied to safeguarding a wide range of IT environments, including national security systems, Defense Department networks, and defense industrial base assets.\n NSA funded  MITRE\u2019s research for developing D3FEND, but like ATT&amp;CK, it\u2019s freely available online now. Cyber professionals can provide comments and recommend improvements at the  D3FEND website.\n Breaking Defense reached out to NSA for comments, but did not receive any before publication.\n Risk reduction is vital in the development of this new Air Force bomber. Northrop Grumman is driving risk out of the program with digital capabilities throughout design, build, prototype, and test.\n Recommended  \u201cThe Department of Defense officially recognizes five domains of warfare,\u201d Rep. Langevin said. \u201cFor four of those domains, the senior civilian is a service secretary. Cyber has a deputy assistant secretary, which is four rungs lower than the other warfighting domains.

federal court proceedings on camera has cleared the Senate committee.\n  On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee   approved two bills aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in the nation\u2019s highest courts. The   Cameras in the Courtroom Act \u201crequires the Supreme Court to permit television coverage of all open sessions of the court,\u201d although the justices can still vote to deny broadcasts if they believe such coverage could directly impact the proceedings. The second bill, the   Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, grants judges in all federal courts the discretion to allow cameras in the courtroom provided that the identities of witnesses and jurors are protected when necessary.\n First introduced in March, the bills have secured bipartisan support, including an endorsement from both the panel\u2019s chair, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, and the committee\u2019s ranking Republican member, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa,   Politico reports. This marks the first time such legislation has cleared the Senate committee in more than a decade, according to the judicial system watchdog Fix the Court. Several members spoke strongly in favor of the bills on Thursday.\n    \u201cI have been introducing legislation to open up our courtrooms to the American people for over 25 years now,\u201d said Grassley in   a statement. \u201cI think if the American people can see how justice is done, they\u2019ll have a better appreciation for it. Right now the working of the courts is a remote process that most people don\u2019t really know about unless they\u2019re lawyers or criminals. These bills would help change that.\u201d\n  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a former prosecutor herself, pointed to the recent trial of former Minneapolis cop and convicted murderer Derek Chauvin as an example of how the transparency that broadcasts provide can improve the public\u2019s trust in the judicial system as a whole.\n   \u201cIt was a moment of redemption in part because people could see their fellow citizens talk about what happened,\u201d Klobuchar said   Thursday. \u201cIf that hadn\u2019t been televised, the verdict could probably have been the same, but people wouldn\u2019t have been able to see that and share in that moment.\u201d\n Of course, not everyone on the Judiciary Committee was singing the bills\u2019 praises. Several Republican lawmakers opposed the transparency measures or attempted to water them down, Politico reports. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called the legislation \u201cill-advised\u201d and argued that the nation\u2019s court system is transparent enough as it stands. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas warned that opening federal courts to cameras could also open them up to the kind of showboating and theatrics endemic to reality TV.\n  \u201cI think it is better for our country if the Supreme Court is a little more boring and doesn\u2019t have Judge Judy as the dynamic in the courtroom,\u201d he said.\n In pre-pandemic times, the Supreme Court made audio recordings of its proceedings public at the end of each week. Widespread lockdowns related to the spread of covid-19 led the court to provide live audio broadcasts of oral arguments for the first time in its history beginning in May 2020, something many federal appeals courts had already been doing even before the pandemic.\n  However, video recordings have always been a strict no-no in the nation\u2019s highest court, though, in the last year, federal courts have been taking advantage of a provision of the   CARES Act allowing hearings in criminal cases to be held by video conference or teleconference due to the pandemic.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 14:18:31", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662,approves,\u6cd5\u9662", "title": "\u53c2\u8bae\u9662\u6279\u51c6\u7acb\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e7f\u64ad\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a ", "title_en": "Senate Approves Legislation to Broadcast Supreme Court Hearings", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/senate-committee-approves-legislation-to-broadcast-supr-1847169696", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662", "approves", "\u6cd5\u9662"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "334bc482fdbfff236756e7c4c8913e10.jpg", "infoid": 1068187, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u6b63\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u65f6\u901a\u77e5\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e3e\u63aa\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u4e3a\u6253\u7834\u5728\u7ebf\u7684\u8fdd\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u80cc\u666f -

The move is a notable step by the world\u2019s most popular search engine to give people more context about breaking information that\u2019s popular online \u2014 like suspected UFO sightings or developing news stories \u2014 that are actively evolving.\n The new prompt warns users that the results they are seeing are changing quickly, and reads, in part, \u201cIf this topic is new, it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources.\u201d Google confirmed to Recode that it started testing the feature about a week ago. Currently, the company says the notice is only showing up in a small percentage of searches, which tend to be about developing trending topics.\n Companies like  Google,  Twitter, and  Facebook have often  struggled to handle the  high volume of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and unverified news stories that run rampant on the internet. In the past, they have largely stayed away from taking content down in all but the most extreme cases, citing a commitment to free speech values. During the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 US elections, some companies took the unprecedented action of taking down  popular accounts perpetuating misinformation. But the kind of label Google is rolling out \u2014 which simply warns users without blocking content \u2014 reflects a more long-term incremental approach to educating users about questionable or incomplete information.\n \u201cWhen anybody does a search on Google, we\u2019re trying to show you the most relevant, reliable information we can,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, a public liaison for Google Search. \u201cBut we get a lot of things that are entirely new,\u201d\n    Sullivan said the notice isn\u2019t saying that what you\u2019re seeing in search results is right or wrong \u2014 but that it\u2019s a changing situation, and more information may come out later.\n As an example, Sullivan cited a report about a suspected UFO sighting in the UK.\n \u201cSomeone had gotten this police report video released out in Wales, and it\u2019s had a little bit bit of press coverage. But there\u2019s still not a lot about it,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cBut people are probably searching for it, they may be going around on social media \u2014 so we can tell it\u2019s starting to trend. And we can also tell that there\u2019s not a lot of necessarily great stuff that\u2019s out there. And we also think that maybe new stuff will come along,\u201d\n Other examples of trending search queries that could currently prompt the notice are \u201cwhy is britney on lithium\u201d and \u201cblack triangle ufo ocean\u201d\n The feature builds on Google\u2019s recent efforts to help users with \u201csearch literacy,\u201d or to better understand context about what they\u2019re looking up. In April 2020, the company  released a feature telling people when there aren\u2019t enough good matches for their search, and in February 2021, it  added an \u201cabout\u201d button next to most search results showing people a brief Wikipedia description of the site they\u2019re seeing, when available.\n Google told Recode it ran user research on the notice that showed people found it helpful.\n The new prompt is also part of a larger trend by major tech companies to give people more context about new information that could turn out to be be wrong. Twitter, for example,  released a slew of features ahead of the 2020 US elections cautioning users if information they were seeing was not yet verified.\n Some social media researchers welcome the types of added context like the one Google rolled out today, including Renee DiResta at the Stanford Internet Observatory who  tweeted about the feature. It\u2019s a welcome alternative, they say, to the debates around whether or not to ban a certain account or post.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a great way of making people pause before they act on or spread information further,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, a researcher at Harvard who studies online speech. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t involve anyone making judgments about the truth or falsity of any story but just gives the readers more context. \u2026 In almost all breaking news contexts, the first stories are not the complete ones, and so it\u2019s good to remind people of that.\u201d\n There are still some questions about how this all will work, though. For example, it\u2019s not clear exactly what sources Google finds to be reliable on a given search result, and how many reliable sources need to weigh in before a questionable trending news topic loses the label. As the feature rolls out more broadly, we can likely expect to see more discussion about how it\u2019s implemented.\n  Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

Broadly construed, logic, therefore, is that specific branch of philosophy that studies the processes of correct thinking.\n Etymologically speaking, the term \u201clogic\u201d is derived from the Greek word logos, which is often translated in English as \u201cword\u201d, \u201cdiscourse\u201d or \u201creason\u201d. In the Greek tradition of understanding the nature of reality, the term \u201creason\u201d was commonly appropriated. And for the ancient Greek thinkers, logos as \u201creason\u201d could mean two things, namely: 1) that which refers to \u201chuman reason\u201d, which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality, and 2) that which refers to \u201cuniversal intelligence\u201d or \u201crational divine intelligence\u201d\u2015indeed, that universal ruling force that governs the cosmos.\n   When understood in the  second sense, logos then means (as the ancient Greek thinkers would have us believe) the \u201clight-giving principle\u201d, which enables human persons to understand the nature, dynamics, and mysteries of the universe. When understood in the  first sense, that is, as \u201chuman reason\u201d, logos connotes \u201cstudy\u201d, that is, the rationality of the human mind which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality. Thus, when we employ the term logos in our attempt to make sense of or study something, then we are dealing with the term logos in the first sense. For example, when we define the term \u201cpsychology\u201d from the vantage point of its etymology, then we say that psychology comes from the two Greek words, namely,  psyche, which means \u201cmind\u201d, and  logos, which means \u201cstudy\u201d. Thus, etymologically speaking, psychology is defined as the study of the mind. Indeed, it is in this context that \u201clogic\u201d is, again, defined as the study (or science or reason) of the correct processes of thinking or reasoning.\n More specifically, when we study the correct processes of thinking or reasoning, we are necessarily dealing with arguments. Hence,  in logic, we will be primarily dealing with the principles that govern the validity of arguments, that is, whether a certain conclusion follows from the given premises or assumptions. Let us consider the examples below.\n If it rains today, then the road is wet.  It rains today.  Therefore, the road is wet.\n  The professor will be absent if and only if she is sick.  The professor is sick.  Therefore, she will be absent.\n  The arguments above are obviously valid arguments because their conclusions necessarily follow from the premises. Again, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true for the argument to be valid. However, there are more complicated arguments whose validity cannot be determined by simply looking at them. These arguments require a thorough analysis before we can say that they are indeed valid or not. This is precisely what concerns us in logic, and this is what the rest of the discussions in logic would like to address.

Introduction A QR-code is used to encode text as a graphical image. Depending on the characters used in the text various encoding options for a QR- code exists, e.g. Numeric, Alphanumeric and Byte mode. Even in Byte mode a typical QR-code reader tries to interpret a byte sequence as an UTF-8 or ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded text. Thus QR-codes cannot be used to encode arbitrary binary data directly. Such data has to be converted into an appropriate text before that text could be encoded as a QR-code. Compared to already established Base64, Base32 and Base16 encoding schemes, that are described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], the Base45 scheme described in this document offer a more compact QR- code encoding. One important difference from those and Base45 is the key table and that the padding with &#39;=&#39; is not required.2. Conventions Used in This Document The key words &#34;MUST&#34;, &#34;MUST NOT&#34;, &#34;REQUIRED&#34;, &#34;SHALL&#34;, &#34;SHALL NOT&#34;, &#34;SHOULD&#34;, &#34;SHOULD NOT&#34;, &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;, &#34;MAY&#34;, and &#34;OPTIONAL&#34; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].3. Interpretation of Encoded Data Encoded data is to be interpreted as described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648] with the exception that a different alphabet is selected. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 2] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214. The Base45 Encoding A 45-character subset of US-ASCII is used; the 45 characters usable in a QR code in Alphanumeric mode. Base45 encodes 2 bytes in 3 characters, compared to Base64, which encodes 3 bytes in 4 characters. For encoding two bytes [a, b] MUST be interpreted as a number n in base 256, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 16 bits so that the number n = (a*256) + b. This number n is converted to base 45 [c, d, e] so that n = c + (d*45) + (e*45*45). Note the order of c, d an e which are chosen so that the left-most [c] is the least significant. The values c, d and e are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a three character string. The process is reversed when decoding. For encoding a single byte [a], it MUST be interpreted as a base 256 number, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 8 bit. That integer MUST be converted to base 45 [c d] so that a = c + (45*d). The values c and d are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a two character string. A byte string [a b c d ... x y z] with arbitrary content and arbitrary length MUST be encoded as follows: From left to right pairs of bytes are encoded as described above. If the number of bytes is even, then the encoded form is a string with a length which is evenly divisible by 3. If the number of bytes is odd, then the last (rightmost) byte is encoded on two characters as described above. For decoding a Base45 encoded string the inverse operations are performed.4.1. When to use Base45 If binary data is to be stored in a QR-Code one possible way is to use the Alphanumeric mode that uses 11 bits for 2 characters as defined in section 7.3.4 in ISO/IEC 18004:2015 [ISO18004]. The ECI mode indicator for this encoding is 0010. If the data is to be sent via some other transport, a transport encoding suitable for that transport should be used instead of Base45. It is not recommended to first encode data in Base45 and then encode the resulting string in for example Base64 if the data is to be sent via email. Instead the Base45 encoding should be removed, and the data itself should be encoded in Base64. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 3] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.2. The alphabet used in Base45 The Alphanumeric mode is defined to use 45 characters as specified in this alphabet. Table 1: The Base45 Alphabet Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding 00 0 12 C 24 O 36 Space 01 1 13 D 25 P 37 $ 02 2 14 E 26 Q 38 % 03 3 15 F 27 R 39 * 04 4 16 G 28 S 40 + 05 5 17 H 29 T 41 - 06 6 18 I 30 U 42 . 07 7 19 J 31 V 43 / 08 8 20 K 32 W 44 : 09 9 21 L 33 X 10 A 22 M 34 Y 11 B 23 N 35 Z4.3. Encoding examples It should be noted that although the examples are all text, Base45 is an encoding for binary data where each octet can have any value 0-255. Encoding example 1: The string &#34;AB&#34; is the byte sequence [65 66]. The 16 bit value is 65 * 256 + 66 = 16706. 16706 equals 11 + 45 * 11 + 45 * 45 * 8 so the sequence in base 45 is [11 11 8]. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;BB8&#34;. Encoding example 2: The string &#34;Hello!!&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [72 101 108 108 111 33 33]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [18533 27756 28449 33]. Note the 33 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[38 6 9] [36 31 13] [9 2 14] [33 0]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;%69 VD92EX0&#34;. Encoding example 3: The string &#34;base-45&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [98 97 115 101 45 52 53]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [25185 29541 11572 53]. Note the 53 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[30 19 12] [21 26 14] [7 32 5] [8 1]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;UJCLQE7W581&#34;. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 4] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.4. Decoding examples Decoding example 1: The string &#34;QED8WEX0&#34; represents, when looked up in Table 1, the values [26 14 13 8 32 14 33 0]. We arrange at the numbers in chunks of three, except last which can be two, and get [[26 14 13] [8 32 14] [33 0]]. In base 45 we get [26981 29798 33] where the bytes are [[105 101] [116 102] [33]]. If we look at the ascii values we get the string &#34;ietf!&#34;.5. IANA Considerations There are no considerations for IANA in this document.6. Security Considerations When implementing encoding and decoding it is important to be very careful so that buffer overflow or similar does not occur. This of course includes the calculations for modulo 45 and lookup in the table of characters (Table 1). A decoder also must be robust regarding input, including proper handling of any octet value 0-255, including the NUL character (ASCII 0). It should be noted that Base64 and some other encodings pad the string so that the encoding starts with an aligned number of characters, Base45 specifically avoids padding. Because of this, special care has to be taken when odd number of octets are to be encoded, which results not in N*3 characters, but (N-1)*3+2 characters in the encoded string and similarly, at decoding, when the number of encoded characters are not evenly divisible by 3. Base encodings use a specific, reduced alphabet to encode binary data. Non-alphabet characters could exist within base-encoded data, caused by data corruption or by design. Non-alphabet characters may be exploited as a &#34;covert channel&#34;, where non-protocol data can be sent for nefarious purposes. Non-alphabet characters might also be sent in order to exploit implementation errors leading to, e.g., buffer overflow attacks. Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains characters outside the base alphabet (in Table 1) when interpreting base-encoded data. Even though a Base45 encoded string contains only characters from the alphabet in Table 1 the following case has to be considered: The string &#34;FGW&#34; represents 65535 (FFFF in base 16), which is a valid encoding. The string &#34;GGW&#34; would represent 65536 (10000 in base 16), which is represented by more than 16 bit. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 5] Internet-Draft Base45 June 2021 Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains a triplet of characters which, when decoded, result in an unsigned integer which is greater then 65535 (ffff in base 16). It should be noted that the resulting string after encoding to Base45 might include non-URL-safe characters so if the URL including the Base45 encoded data have to be URL safe, one have to use %-encoding.7.

Between hunts, raucous groups \u201chaul out\u201d onto sea ice to rest. In recent decades, the withering of Arctic ice floes has forced such gatherings onto land, where thousands of walruses lie two or three deep\u2014the weak and the young can die from suffocation or stampedes. In 2019, the Russian photographer Evgenia Arbugaeva spent two weeks, with a scientist, stuck in the middle of a haul-out in the far eastern Chukotka region. The animals stank so badly that her eyes watered. At night, they fought, or made noises, she says, like orcs in \u201c The Lord of the Rings.\u201d In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s more haunting images, a walrus looks in toward her camera through the rough wooden doorway of a gloomy hut. Behind the creature was a floundering mass of its fellows, all leathery flesh and raised tusks. The transfixing thing is the walrus\u2019s eye, which appears to regard the hut\u2019s interior the way an albatross seemingly did  Melville\u2019s Ishmael: \u201cThrough its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.\u201d\n   Arbugaeva was born in the port town of Tiksi, in Siberia. A graduate of the photojournalism program at the International Center of Photography and a contributing photographer to  National Geographic, Arbugaeva made the \u201cChukotka\u201d series between 2018 and 2019, over the course of four trips. The image of the walrus in the doorway sits alongside photos of more or less austere interiors and scenes of traditional hunting life. A dead whale lies at the water\u2019s edge, stars winking overhead. In a small boat, four men\u2014one of them, cigarette in mouth, raising his rifle\u2014approach a walrus in a ritual that looks (firearm aside) ancient and still, violence as bated breath. As Arbugaeva tells it, Chukchi hunters speak silently to their prey after the hunt is over, asking for forgiveness and explaining how they will use the whale\u2019s body. In these photographs, and frequently in Arbugaeva\u2019s work, the scenes have a subdued underwater look, as if recovered from the deep past or icebound legend.\n   The darkling aesthetic is already present in \u201c Weather Man,\u201d the earliest of the four stories (as Arbugaeva prefers to say) in the project, begun in 2013. Arbugaeva told me that it takes weeks to reach each of her Arctic destinations\u2014by plane, boat, and dogsled. Once there, detached from news and ordinary life, the mind behaves strangely, filling the blankness of a daylight landscape, then losing itself in darkness and distance. \u201cWeather Man\u201d is a study of a meteorologist, Vyacheslav Korotki, who lives amid this emptiness, in Khodovarikha, in northern Russia. Arbugaeva uses digital cameras robust enough for Arctic weather; nonetheless, in some respects, her photographs of Korotki\u2014attending to his paper records, visiting an old lighthouse for firewood, making matchstick houses to pass the time\u2014look as though they could have been made at any point in the past century.\n  This atmosphere is not just a matter of style. Some of the places that Arbugaeva photographs really do hover on the edge of history, threatening to blink out. The island of Dikson, in the Kara Sea, is one of the fastest-warming spots in all of Russia, one half of a settlement\u2014the other half is on the mainland\u2014whose population greatly declined after the end of the Soviet Union, from five thousand to around three hundred today. The island portion is populated only by meteorologists. Arbugaeva travelled there with her brother, a filmmaker; she visited all the vacant buildings but struggled to find a way to photograph them. Pictures of ruins from the Soviet era have become a clich\u00e9 in recent decades, but those taken by Arbugaeva conjure something other than the  frisson of  Ostalgie. Her project was saved by, of all things, the fantastical arrival of the aurora borealis; for a matter of hours, confectionary spirals of jade light transformed the island. Arbugaeva raced, sweating, between scenes she had already scouted: a piano clogged with snow, a button-eyed toy by a frosted window, sharp-edged green shadows advancing on the town.\n   An exhibition of Arbugaeva\u2019s work, which recently concluded at the Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London, is called \u201c Hyperborea\u201d\u2014an allusion to a tribe in Greek mythology that lived beyond the north wind. Arbugaeva has long been fascinated by speculative maps of this territory, \u201cthe way the Arctic was alive in people\u2019s imagination before they even set foot there.\u201d Though she calls herself a documentarian, imagination and even magic play parts in her work. Her photographs, she says, may seem too detached from history, \u201ctoo sweet\u201d in their auroral spectacle or still-life hush. The unreality is deliberate. Her work is meant to invoke the folktales attached to Arctic landscapes, the sense of a world subtended by spirits that must be thanked or placated. It is also meant to reflect a modern, magic-realist attitude, with which the facts of the Arctic\u2014the harshness of traditional life, the exploitation of natural resources,  the depredations of global warming\u2014may be expressed in all their complexity. Arbugaeva\u2019s series \u201cKanin Nos\u201d is a portrait of a couple, Ivan and Evgenia, who are lighthouse keepers and meteorologists at a remote station on the Kanin Peninsula, between the White and Barents Seas. In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s images, the couple hardly register amid a snowy haze as they approach the lighthouse. (Evgenia avoids going outside alone, for fear of polar bears.) When Arbugaeva travelled to photograph Ivan and Evgenia, they asked her to bring some apples, and she photographed those, too. Wrapped in newspaper, to protect against the cold, they appear as treasures from a world left behind.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.",

With two dots for eyes and a slight hint of a smile, the 7,000-year-old figurine could be a ritual object, perhaps an amulet, or even a simple doll. The thumb-sized face is one of several dozen figures \u2014 mostly of goats and sheep \u2014 unearthed during an archaeological exploration lasting almost three years at En Esur in Israel  1, about 52 kilometres north of Tel Aviv.\n The excavation at En Esur, also known by its Arabic name of Ein Asawir, \u201cis an extraordinary project\u201d, says Dina Shalem, an archaeologist employed by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), who co-directed the dig with IAA archaeologists Yitzhak Paz and Itai Elad. By the Early Bronze Age, 5,000 years ago, Paz says that En Esur was a \u201cmega-city, the largest so far known in the Southern Levant\u201d, a region spanning modern Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Excavating En Esur was, he says, \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime experience\u201d.\n Built over the remains of an earlier, smaller village (from which the stone face was unearthed), the metropolis spanned an estimated 65 hectares and was home to between 5,000 and 6,000 people; more than 20 times the typical size of villages in that area at the time. Thanks to a year-round flowing spring, the townspeople of En Esur thrived, growing wheat, barley, lentils, grapes and olives, and raising cows, pigs, sheep and goats.\n A visit to the site in November 2019 during an excavation showed how enormous the place once was. Stretching into the distance were the remains of house foundations and alleyways. A grand, 600-square-metre temple enclosed two massive stone basins \u2014 the larger of which was 3.3 metres long and was filled with burnt animal bones, possibly from sacrifices. \u201cWe were really amazed at how densely built the city was,\u201d Shalem says, \u201cthe planning, the streets\u201d. A gigantic pile of approximately 5 million pottery shards, excavated from the site, attests to the domestic life of this bustling town. \u201cPottery, flint, figurines, burials \u2014 we can tell that it\u2019s a complex society,\u201d she says.\n There\u2019s a lot for the archaeologists and labourers to label and store for shipment. But they were not the only ones working at the site. Engineers were also taking measurements for Netivei Israel, the country\u2019s transport infrastructure company, which funded the archaeological excavation in preparation for the building of a road intersection on part of the site. This vanished world, briefly uncovered, disappeared again from view when it was covered with earth and cement over the winter.\n En Esur is a huge site, so most of it is still underground and untouched. But the massive temple and the other excavated parts will remain buried under the road intersection for decades \u2014 possibly longer. Critics charge that this important evidence will never be seen again.\n  This year, hundreds of other archaeological sites might also be buried or destroyed. That\u2019s because most excavations in the country are salvage digs, authorized by the IAA, the government body that oversees antiquities and archaeological sites within the state of Israel. Salvage digs are conducted to document archaeological remains in danger of destruction because of development plans. But the IAA very rarely blocks construction on top of an important archaeological site or takes steps to preserve some portion of the site from being destroyed, says Yonathan Mizrachi, chief executive of Emek Shaveh, an Israeli non-governmental organization based in Jerusalem that works to protect ancient sites as public assets.\n In 2019, salvage digs accounted for more than half of the 424 licences issued by the IAA for archaeological excavations and surveys, according to the agency. In almost all cases, after the archaeologists excavated the sites and removed valuable artefacts, construction projects were allowed to proceed, says Mizrachi.\n  Paving over archaeologically valuable sites isn\u2019t unique to Israel, Mizrachi says. In Turkey, for example, the 12,000-year-old town of Hasankeyf, a monumental site on the Tigris river, has slowly been submerged beneath the new Il\u0131su dam. But some archaeologists say that the situation is particularly problematic in Israel compared with many other countries. One big issue is that the majority of the IAA\u2019s budget comes from the salvage digs before construction projects \u2014 and the government itself is the biggest developer in Israel, says archaeologist Uzi Dahari, a former deputy director of the IAA. The country is also building rapidly to keep up with a surging population. Archaeologists also argue that the Israeli government favours saving ancient Jewish sites, especially in Jerusalem, over ones linked to other religions.\n In Israel, says Mizrachi, \u201cthere are no red lines, or any understanding or rules [for] what should be kept and should be destroyed\u201d.\n Gideon Avni, head of the archaeology division at the IAA, says that rather than block construction after a salvage dig, the IAA tries to prevent development projects in advance if a site is known to be important. The agency, he says, follows strict criteria established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization when deciding whether or not a site should be permanently saved, or covered and built on. He adds that \u201cevery act that we are doing is subject to public monitoring, professional monitoring, our internal system, which tries to prevent this conflict of interest.\u201d\n And some archaeologists in Israel say that many sites would not be excavated at all if it weren\u2019t for the construction projects that provide funding and an impetus for digs. Given Israel\u2019s fast-growing population, they say, the country can\u2019t preserve as many archaeological sites as supporters would like. \u201cI would like the whole country to be covered in archaeology,\u201d says Avni. \u201cBut my children need a place to live.\u201d\n   Compared with other countries around the Mediterranean, Israel has a much higher concentration of archaeological sites in a smaller area, Dahari says. There are about 35,000 sites in a country of 22,145 square kilometres.\n An average of 200\u2013300 archaeological sites are excavated each year as rescue or salvage digs before development. But in evaluating whether construction at the sites can go ahead, the IAA has a conflict of interest because it is heavily funded by the construction industry, says Dahari.\n In 2019, construction-funded salvage digs accounted for 83% of the IAA\u2019s budget of 426 million shekels (US$122.7 million). \u201cOn the one hand, their responsibility is to restore and to protect archaeological sites, but on the other hand, if you will tell the constructor, \u2018don\u2019t build, because this is an archaeological site\u2019, where will the money come from for the IAA? That\u2019s a big contradiction,\u201d Dahari says. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the Israel Antiquities Authority,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I blame the government, because of the budgetary system of salvage excavations.\u201d\n Yorke Rowan, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of Chicago, Illinois, agrees. \u201cThat is one contradictory aspect of the way the IAA works: a major bureaucracy depends on funding from the construction industry to fund itself.\u201d Rowan, who has studied stone bowls, mortars and grinders dating to 5000\u20133000   from previous digs at En Esur, says the difficulty is that the IAA is \u201cmandated to preserve and protect archaeological sites and heritage, but that funding is tied to positive outcomes for development projects\u201d.\n Adding to the pressure is Israel\u2019s rapidly growing population. The nation had a fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman in 2018, compared with 1.7 for the United States and an average of 1.6 in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to which Israel belongs (see \u2018Population boom\u2019). Israel\u2019s current population is more than 9 million; by 2065, according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the population is predicted to swell to 20 million, which would make the country  one of the most densely populated on the planet.\n  The effects of this population boom are obvious across the country. New neighbourhoods crammed with high-rise apartment blocks are springing up on the outskirts of many towns; multi-lane highways criss-cross the country; gleaming malls and industrial zones mark the landscape. Between 2014 and 2017, according to HaMaarag, a consortium of environmental agencies based in Jerusalem, Israel lost 107 square kilometres of undeveloped land to construction and farming.\n With population growth driving so much construction, says Dahari, \u201cthe IAA cannot say, \u2018this is an archaeological site, don\u2019t build anything\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s impossible\u201d. He says the authority \u201cis not finding the middle way between the needs of development and the protection of the archaeological site\u201d. Dahari says that during his tenure at the IAA, the agency classified about 700 of the 35,000 sites in Israel as unique archaeological sites and therefore off-limits for development. But some of these 700 sites \u201care only partially protected\u201d, he says.\n  The list includes a site called Tel Beit Shemesh, which dates back at least to the seventh century  . The settlement was possibly a large-scale centre for olive-oil production  2. Archaeologists regard this site as important because it was located between two rival population centres more than two and a half millennia ago. It would take archaeologists decades to study this kind of site, but a four-lane highway will soon run through it. That is, says Dahari, \u201cin my point of view, a crime against archaeology\u201d. Avni acknowledges that the construction at Tel Beit Shemesh, \u201cwas a very, very painful compromise for us\u201d, balancing the need to preserve the site and building a highway that would serve up to 250,000 people. He said the current plan is to recreate the site in a park on a bridge over the highway.\n  Time is also running out for an ancient hill village called Nebi Zechariah that is at least 2,000 years old. The excavations of the village lie in an industrial zone on the outskirts of Modiin, a city about 26 kilometres northwest of Jerusalem. The excavated buildings have a forsaken air. The stone walls, doorways and mosaic-tiled floors are overgrown with brambles and weeds; a nearby billboard trumpeting a new industrial and logistics centre is pasted with a red sign saying \u201csales closed\u201d. In the distance, the high-rise blocks of the expanding city of Modiin can be glimpsed. By 2040, according to the city plan, the addition of 43,000 housing units will enable the population to more than double, from 93,000 to 240,000. And those plans call for construction in the city\u2019s industrial zone, including over Nebi Zechariah.\n  The ancient site was clearly once a bustling place. Originally founded as a Jewish village during the Roman period, beginning in 63  , it was occupied continuously for about 1,000 years by waves of polytheists, Byzantine Christians and Muslims, living together until it was abandoned in the eleventh century during a period of climate-change-induced drought. Its inhabitants built luxurious houses paved with mosaics, chiselled Christian crosses and Greek inscriptions into their olive presses, and produced glass weights inscribed with Arabic script for weighing coins.\n \u201cThere is a very interesting story in this type of site, because it consists of a kind of continuity of the rural population of ancient Palestine from Roman until Crusader times,\u201d says Avni. \u201cIt also shows a kind of living together of different communities in a settled place at the same time.\u201d\n But that does not mean the decision to build on it was wrong, according to Avni. He says that the settlement is just one out of 400 similar sites of the period in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s not unique when you look at the whole country,\u201d he says. And population pressures inevitably lead to compromises that enable modern development. Even so, \u201cit\u2019s really a pity, when you look at it as a citizen, to destroy it\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful site, and could have been preserved as a park.\u201d\n That\u2019s unlikely to happen. Eyal Malul, a spokesperson for the municipality of Modiin, says part of the land is designated for building.\n  Nebi Zechariah and sites like it might have a better chance of being preserved if they dovetailed with Israel\u2019s national narrative, Mizrachi suggests. \u201cIn general, the Israeli government, for generations, is dealing with Jewish history,\u201d he says. As an example of the government\u2019s interest in preserving Jewish history through archaeology, Mizrachi and other researchers point to a site called the City of David, located in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. An organization called the Ir David Foundation (El-Ad) is authorized by the government to sponsor excavations there and run the City of David National Park. El-Ad claims that the biblical King David built a palace in the City of David 3,000 years ago and says it is \u201cdedicated to the preservation and development of the Biblical City of David\u201d.\n But there is serious disagreement among archaeologists as to whether the large structure that El-Ad identified as King David\u2019s palace was actually from the era in which the biblical king supposedly lived, and whether this ancient stone structure can be linked to him. \u201cEl-Ad\u2019s narrative is based on biblical history, not archaeology. They are content as long as archaeology doesn\u2019t contradict their reading,\u201d says Raphael Greenberg, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University. He argues that El-Ad is \u201csupported by the Israeli administration, that uses archaeology selectively to market its ideology\u201d.\n El-Ad rejects that argument. Doron Spielman, a spokesperson for the organization, says that there have been 20 excavations of the site over 150 years and they have found numerous carved inscriptions and clay stamps with the names of biblical figures. \u201cThere is no other place on Earth that has found more corroborative evidence of the biblical story than the City of David.\u201d\n When it comes to saving or excavating ruins, Avni says, \u201cwe have been accused many times of giving preference to Jewish sites or synagogues. When you look at the history of archaeology in this country, it\u2019s not baseless.\u201d But he says that those criticisms applied to the early years of the country\u2019s modern history, and that now, \u201cmost of the sites we are excavating are Byzantine Christian, early Muslim, medieval Muslim and Ottoman.\u201d Avni\u2019s own speciality is early Islamic archaeology.\n Yet some researchers say that when archaeological sites involve religions other than Judaism, they sometimes get less protection. And many Israelis aren\u2019t aware that people of different religions coexisted in the region after Islam arrived in the seventh century  , says Mizrachi. He adds that sites from the early Islamic period \u201care extremely important to be preserved and Nebi Zechariah is a very good example of that\u201d.\n  Without financing, however, the likelihood of preserving such sites is slim. Unlike the excavations funded by El-Ad, very few of the digs that the IAA conducts are financed independently. There would be no excavation at En Esur had a road junction not been planned there, and laboratory research on material collected at the site will continue for years, say the IAA archaeologists who work there. \u201cWhat we rescue is the knowledge, not necessarily the site,\u201d says Paz. He and the other IAA archaeologists who excavated En Esur declined to say whether the site itself should have been preserved.\n But others aren\u2019t so guarded. Greenberg, an expert on the Bronze Age in the Levant and a former IAA employee, questions the speed at which the salvage dig at En Esur was conducted, although he emphasizes that this is not the fault of the archaeologists but of the system that forces rapid excavations. \u201cBecause the site was excavated under severe time constraints, and because of the unprecedented quantity of finds that must be processed, it will be years before we have a detailed understanding of the results,\u201d he says.\n Less-destructive alternatives exist, Greenberg contends. For example, he suggests that 5% of the threatened site could have been set aside and excavated thoroughly, with the road project covering the rest of it.\n  Greenberg has general concerns about speedy salvage excavations. Academic excavations typically take many years. Researchers alternate time in the field with longer stretches in the lab to study findings and adjust their plans for later stages of the dig. That\u2019s not possible during a salvage operation, he says.\n The kind of alternative that Greenberg envisaged for En Esur is sometimes possible in other countries, such as the United States and France, even if excavations do get paved over there, too. Archaeologist Morag Kersel at DePaul University in Chicago, points to the Miami Circle in Florida, a round structure linked to the Native American Tequesta people that was scheduled to be destroyed, but was preserved after protests. Sometimes, she says, \u201cwhen it is feasible, projects are redesigned to avoid the destruction of the site\u201d.\n One difference in the United States, explains Rowan, is that \u201cthere is an extra level of oversight at the state level\u201d. Each US state has a State Historic Preservation Office that oversees surveys and excavations. If nothing important is found during a salvage survey, the office will approve the site for development, but it can mandate extra testing, including remote sensing and excavation, if significant evidence is found.\n \u201cSomething like En Esur, if it was in the United States, that would be stunning. There\u2019s not a chance you would pave it over,\u201d says Rowan. \u201cI have great faith that they did a good job, because I know the archaeologists. It does seem a shame to pave over a site like that.\u201d\n Archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji, former director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Nanterre, calls En Esur \u201ca great discovery\u201d. In France, he says, \u201cit has happened many times that the line of a highway had to be changed because an important discovery was made\u201d.\n Even so, his approach is pragmatic: \u201cWe have to look for an equilibrium, for balance, between the necessity of modern life and the necessity of preserving the heritage.\u201d\n      1.

goal is to make our Camera the fastest way to share a moment. We do not want Snapchatters to face any delays when they are in the moment and want to share with their real friends.\n Network requests are on the critical path of using Snapchat. Compared to a UI update or disk write that takes milliseconds, network latency can take seconds with high error rate and device constraints. To reduce network latency and error, we make requests and responses smaller, reduce unnecessary sync, utilize global content distribution partners to bring media close to the people who use it, and use an efficient, next generation network protocol called Quick UDP Internet Connections, or   QUIC for short.\n   Let\u2019s first take a quick look at the network stack before QUIC. Take a Snap send as an example: on the application layer, we put the Snap media into the   HTTP2 request payload. Then we use   TLS to ensure the connection safety on the security layer and leverage   TCP to split the request into chunks and upload the Snap to the server. However the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 stack is suboptimal for the mobile network environment. For example, TCP requests will fail if a Snapchatter\u00a0switches between WiFi and WWAN. For a user chatting with friends, failure to send a message due to a connection drop can lead to a degraded experience.\n   QUIC is a transport protocol for the internet, developed by engineers at Google. QUIC is the foundation of   HTTP3 that replaces the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 and is built on top of UDP. QUIC solves a number of transport-layer and application-layer problems while requiring little or no change from application developers. As the above diagram depicts, QUIC does not alter the low-level operating system network protocols nor does it alter high-level HTTP.\n  Faster connection establishment: QUIC handshakes support   zero roundtrips before sending payload, compared to   1-3 round trips for TCP+TLS.\n Improved congestion control: QUIC has pluggable congestion control, and provides richer information to the congestion control algorithm than TCP. For example   QUIC BBR v1 and   QUIC BBR v2.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: For HTTP2 connections, when a TCP packet is lost, no streams on that connection can make forward progress until the packet is retransmitted and received by the far side. This leads to increased latency and a potentially degraded user experience on mobile network connections. QUIC eliminates this stalling for other streams multiplexed over the same connection.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: A TCP request will fail if the IP changes. However, QUIC connections are recognized by a QUIC protocol layer randomly generated 64 bit identifier, so a client using QUIC can continue in-flight requests, uninterrupted across a change in IP address, allowing for an undisturbed user experience.\n   Faster connection establishment: At Snapchat, before QUIC, p90 connection setup took up to 300ms. This connection setup latency translates to user waiting latency, and blocks the user from receiving Snaps and viewing Stories. Faster connection on QUIC directly reduces user waiting latency and improves the user experience.\n Improved congestion control: At Snap, the size of upload media can be as large as 10MB. A better congestion control algorithm improves throughput, reduces latency and error rate especially for large media.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: Snapchat has rich use cases with short content, including Snaps, Stories, Discover content, etc. Normally there are multiple download streams using the same connection. QUIC eliminates the HTTP2 head of blocking issues, such as avoiding the send message requests blocking spotlight requests.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: When with friends, failure to send a message due to a drop in their wifi connection can lead to a degraded experience. Connection migration solves this pain point.\n Detection of lost connection: A long loading spinner due to a lost connection is disturbing, especially when a Snapchatter is in full screen mode enjoying content. With QUIC, when requests fail due to a lost connection, we can detect and retry while providing a user-friendly UI.\n  Snapchat\u2019s client network stack is built on top of the open-source mobile network library   Cronet. Snap leverages Cronet not only for QUIC but also for improved observability through rich metrics and logs. We are able to build a cohesive view of client and server network performance.\n  We chose different protocols based on the network performance across countries and platforms. In general, we observed that enabling QUIC improved p90/P99 network latency by 6-20% and network errors by 3%-8%. There are even more improvements on the low network connectivity user cohort. Here we showcase three examples.\n In the first example, we enabled QUIC on our ads service in Oct 2019. We observed latency improvements across P90/P99 and error rate.\n   We observed error rate improvements across all error codes, including connection timeout, connection lost, request timeout. In further breakdowns of the latency improvements by country and region, we observed higher latency improvement for countries and regions with relatively worse network quality and further geo distance to our services.\n In the second example, on top of QUIC, enabling BBR congestion control on the client to server path also brought significant latency improvements. And there are more improvements with larger request payload.\n   In the last example, by enabling connection migration on Android, the network request success rate when losing a wifi connection increased by 20%.\n  With the success story on QUIC integration, moving forward, we will double down on QUIC, including:", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:45:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "quick,quic", "title": "quick.

The vast majority are unknown to science and researchers suggest understanding the novel interactions between bacteria and viruses in our microbiome could help develop future therapeutic treatments for disease.\n Over the last few years most  microbiome research has focused on how the bacteria living in our gut influence our health. But our microbiome consists of much more than bacteria. Unique populations of parasites, viruses and  fungi also live inside us.\n Last year a team of researchers published one of the first catalogs of gut viral populations, called the  Gut Virome Database. That study detailed more than 33,000 unique viral populations.\n Now an international team of researchers has created an even larger gut virome database, analyzing nearly 12,000 fecal samples from subjects spanning 24 countries. The research identified 54,118 unique viral species.\n \u201cRemarkably (but perhaps predictably), more than 90 percent of these viral species are new to science,\u201d write Philip Hugenholtz and Soo Jen Low, two University of Queensland (UQ) researchers working on the project. \u201cThey collectively encode more than 450,000 distinct proteins \u2013 a huge reservoir of functional potential that may either be beneficial or detrimental to their microbial, and in turn human, hosts.\u201d\n Around 75 percent of the viral DNA detected in the study can be linked to bacteriophages, a particular type of virus that only infect bacteria and are harmless to humans.\n In the first half of the 20th century bacteriophage therapy was seen as a promising way to fight bacterial infections, but the rise of effective antibiotics led to a wane in research. That was until antibiotic-resistant bacteria caused a resurgence of interest. Now researchers are investigating phage therapy as an option for everything from  diabetic foot ulcers to  obesity.\n A potential outcome from cataloging these novel gut bacteriophages could be a form of precision microbiome modification. In the future if there are certain populations of gut bacteria doctors need to reduce or amplify, releasing viruses known to target those specific bacterial species could be a treatment solution.\n \u201cThere has been discussion of potentially customizing people\u2019s gut microbiomes using dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics or even &#39;transpoosions&#39; (faecal microbiota transplants), to improve an individual\u2019s health,\u201d explain the UQ researchers. \u201cPhage therapy may be a useful addition to this objective, by adding species or even subspecies-level precision to microbiome manipulation. For example, the bacterial pathogen  Clostridioides difficile (or  C. diff for short) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea that could be specifically targeted by phages.\u201d\n Of course, if we are only just starting to understand how gut bacteria influences our health then the study of gut viruses is positively embryonic. The researchers behind this new study indicate their findings most likely comprise just a fraction of the total diversity of viruses living inside us, with plenty more new species left to discover.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:45:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u80a0\u9053,unknown,\u7ec6\u83cc", "title": "\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u80a0\u9053\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc740K\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2 ", "title_en": "Over 40k previously unknown viruses found in the human gut microbiome", "transed": 1, "url": "https://newatlas.com/science/virus-gut-virome-microbiome-unknown-species-discovered/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u80a0\u9053", "unknown", "\u7ec6\u83cc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "204841039ab2b20050059d5d47396a44.jpg", "infoid": 1068179, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bbe\u65bd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1c\u5317\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u3002  \u62df\u8bae\u7684\u690d\u7269\u6bcf\u5e74\u5c06\u5220\u9664\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u4e07\u5428\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3 - \u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a40\u4e07\u68f5\u6811\u3002  \u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u6d77\u5cb8\u7684\u6d77\u5e95\u4e0a\u6c38\u4e45\u5730\u50a8\u5b58\u3002  \u8fd9\u9879\u76f4\u63a5\u822a\u7a7a\u6355\u83b7\uff08DAC\uff09\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u697c\u540d\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u78b3\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u3002  \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "A large facility capable of extracting significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the air is being planned for north east Scotland.\n The proposed plant would remove up to one million tonnes of CO2 every year - the same amount taken up by around 40 million trees.\n The extracted gas could be stored permanently deep under the seabed off the Scottish coast.\n    This Direct Air Capture (DAC) plan is a joint project between UK firm  Storegga and Canadian company  Carbon Engineering.\n It&#39;s at a very early stage of development - today&#39;s announcement is the beginning of the engineering and design of the plant.\n  A feasibility study has already been carried out and if everything goes well, the facility would be operational by 2026.\n  However there are many hurdles, including planning and finance - and a site for the plant won&#39;t be selected until next year.\n If it does go ahead it would be the biggest DAC facility in Europe and depending on the final configuration, could be the biggest in the world.\n  According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if the world wants to stay safe, then the rise in global temperatures needs to be kept below 1.5C by the end of this century.\n There&#39;s not much wiggle room left: in 2020  temperatures were already 1.2C above the historical level.\n  To keep the mercury down, we need to curb the emissions of the warming gases that are driving them up.\n  The IPCC says that rapid cuts in carbon from cars, home heating and almost every aspect of our lives will be needed over the next decade.\n Even then, say the scientists, the world will still need to suck significant amounts of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to stay below the 1.5C threshold.\n While planting trees is one important approach to this problem, technology is also being used to capture CO2 directly from the air.\n &#34;Even if all the other measures that we&#39;re taking to avoid emissions, electric cars, renewable energy, those types of things, even if those succeed, you still need carbon removal,&#34; said Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering.\n &#34;Direct air capture I think is going to be a significant part of the UK is net zero plan.&#34;\n  &#34;For us a typical facility is about a million tonnes of CO2 removal per year. That&#39;s the equivalent of 40 million trees.&#34;\n   At their pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, they&#39;ve been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015, pulling down around 1 tonne of CO2 every day.\n Their system involves a fan to suck in air, which is then exposed to a liquid mixture that binds the carbon dioxide.\n   When these are treated at temperature of about 900C, the pellets decompose into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide.\n  At that point it can be pumped underground and buried permanently, sold for commercial use or even turned into liquid fuel.\n Right now the plan is for Carbon Engineering licence their technology to UK firm Storegga, who will be responsible for choosing the site and building the facility.\n  According to both companies involved, north east Scotland has significant advantages for this type of technology.\n  They point to the fact that there is abundant renewable energy sources, there&#39;s a skilled workforce from the North Sea oil industry that have the type of skills needed to build and operate a DAC facility.\n But a key advantage are pipelines going out under the sea to allow the permanent burial of the captured carbon.\n &#34;We&#39;re keen to locate the plant as close as possible to transport and storage infrastructure so we don&#39;t actually have to suffer more and more costs to move captured carbon offshore and then underground,&#34; said Alan James from Storegga.\n  Carbon Engineering has received significant investment from fossil fuel companies in the past and is working closely with one firm on the development of a DAC plant in Texas.\n Oil companies are keen on good quality CO2 because they can use it to flush out extra oil from depleted wells.\n  &#34;I came out of the oil industry in 2007, largely because I was getting concerned about what the impact was,&#34; he told BBC News.\n &#34;None of the emissions that we take out here will be used for extracting more hydrocarbons. That&#39;s not what our business now is about. We have nothing to do with producing hydrocarbons, period.&#34;\n  Scientists say that DAC, if deployed widely, will have major impacts on energy, water and land use.\n By 2050,  according to this report from last year, food crop prices could rise more than five-fold in some parts of the world.\n Some people are also worried that if direct air capture becomes economically viable, then governments might start to go easy on cutting emissions.\n  However, supporters of DAC say that&#39;s not the case - they argue that for sectors that are hard to cut, including shipping, aviation and the oil and gas industry, then DAC is a good option for limiting their impact on the climate.\n Researchers who&#39;ve studied these emerging technologies say it would be foolish to rely fully on them and neglect the basic steps of decarbonising power, transport and industry.\n &#34;It&#39;s a much more sensible strategy to treat these technologies as a really nice addition, we should work hard on them and make sure that they can become cost competitive, and economic in the 2020s,&#34; said Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.\n &#34;But at the same time, we need to just make sure we reduce emissions as fast as possible as far as possible. So that if DAC does come along, then then that&#39;s great. That&#39;s a really nice addition to our toolkit if you like, but we definitely don&#39;t rely on them.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:03:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u62c6\u5378,scale,dac", "title": "\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u7684\u5927\u578b\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u62c6\u5378\u8bbe\u65bd ", "title_en": "Large-Scale CO2 Removal Facility Set For Scotland", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57588248", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u62c6\u5378", "scale", "dac"]}]
