While that happens, we&#39;re resurfacing some classic Ars stories like this 2013 excerpt from  The Internet Police, Deputy Editor Nate Anderson&#39;s look at how the Internet changed the game for criminals and law enforcement ( now available in paperback!). This piece on bringing down junk email king Spamford Wallace first published on December 22, 2013, and it appears unchanged below.</p><p>20年12月28日更新：这是年底假期，而且Ars的许多工作人员仍在享受一些必要的停机时间。发生这种情况时，我们将重现一些经典的Ars故事，例如2013年互联网警察摘录的摘录，副编辑内特·安德森（Nate Anderson）着眼于互联网如何改变了犯罪分子和执法部门的游戏方式（现已提供平装本！ ）。这篇有关降低垃圾电子邮件之王Spamford Wallace的文章于2013年12月22日首次发布，而在下面未作更改。</p><p>  On a warm April morning in 2007, one of the world’s most notorious spammers walked through the doors of the Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse in Las Vegas. Though the Federal Trade Commission was attempting to collect a $4 million judgment against him, Sanford “Spamford” Wallace showed up to his sworn deposition without a lawyer—and without any of the documents required of him.</p><p>  在2007年4月一个温暖的早晨，世界上最臭名昭著的垃圾邮件发送者之一走进了拉斯维加斯劳埃德·D·乔治·联邦法院的门。尽管联邦贸易委员会试图对他作出400万美元的判决，但桑福德·“斯帕姆福德·”华莱士在没有律师的情况下宣誓就职，也没有任何他所需的文件。</p><p> Wallace, though nominally cooperative, had been nearly impossible to reach. When attorneys from the social network MySpace had sued him weeks before, the process server tasked with delivering legal documents couldn’t make contact with Wallace and eventually went to the OPM Nightclub where Wallace worked weekends as a $400-a-week disc jockey under the name “DJ MasterWeb.” The process server claimed to have approached Wallace at the club before being intercepted by security guards; the lawsuit papers were literally thrown at Wallace in an attempt to get good service on him.</p><p> 华莱士虽然名义上是合作的，但几乎是不可能达成的。当社交网络MySpace的律师在几周前起诉他时，负责提供法律文件的流程服务器无法与Wallace联系，最终去了OPM夜总会，Wallace在周末以每周400美元的唱片骑师的身份工作。名称为“ DJ MasterWeb”。进程服务器声称在被保安人员拦截之前已在俱乐部接近华莱士；诉讼文件实际上是扔在华莱士身上的，目的是要为他提供良好的服务。</p><p> FTC lawyer David Frankel, who was overseeing Wallace courthouse questioning as part of a separate spam case brought by the government, had resorted to telephone calls, FedEx packages, and e-mails to contact Wallace; he even sent a personal messenger on occasion. Despite the extraordinary measures, Frankel didn’t know when he showed up to court that April morning whether Wallace would actually arrive.</p><p> FTC律师大卫·弗兰克尔（David Frankel）负责监督华莱士法院的审讯工作，这是政府提起的另一起垃圾邮件案件的一部分，他已通过电话，联邦快递包裹和电子邮件与华莱士联系；他甚至有时会派一个私人使者。尽管采取了非常规措施，但弗兰克尔（Frankel）不知道当他在四月早晨出庭时，华莱士是否会真正到来。</p><p> Wallace did arrive. After swearing to tell the truth in his testimony, he explained to Frankel that the problems weren’t the result of malice but were instead caused by utter disorganization. “Let me just state, for the record, that I am chronically disorganized, and that’s one of the reasons it’s so difficult to communicate with me, and some of the things that would appear to the normal person to be uncooperative, it’s actually possible and very often related to the fact that I’m a very disorganized person,” he said at the beginning of his testimony. “I think you’ll see that as we continue this conversation that as a lot of documents haven’t been filed or organized in a very efficient manner by myself, I want to just state for the record that that is something that I could probably have a psychiatrist to verify if I had to.”</p><p> 华莱士确实到了。在发誓在证词中说出真相后，他向弗兰克尔（Frankel）解释说，问题不是恶意造成的，而是完全由混乱导致的。 “据我记录，我长期处于混乱状态，这就是与我沟通如此困难的原因之一，而在正常人看来有些不合作的事情，实际上是有可能的，我经常是个杂乱无章的人，”他在作证开始时说。 “我认为您会看到，在我们继续进行对话时，由于我自己没有以非常有效的方式归档或整理许多文件，我只想记录在案，这是我可能让精神病医生来核实我是否必须这样做。”</p><p>  Yet Wallace had been organized enough to become a massive spammer. Born in 1968, he attended high school in Maplewood, New Jersey, but realized the academic world wasn’t for him. He tried attending college twice, first at SUNY-Buffalo and then at New Jersey’s Ramapo College; he didn’t last a semester at either. He later described himself as “not a good student.”</p><p>  然而，华莱士组织得足够强大，足以成为垃圾邮件发送者。他生于1968年，就读于新泽西州Maplewood的一家高中，但意识到学术世界并不适合他。他曾两次尝试上大学，首先是纽约州立大学布法罗分校，然后是新泽西州的拉马波学院。他两个都没有上学期。后来他称自己“不是一个好学生”。</p><p>  That didn’t stop him from finding monetary success—and public notoriety—during the mid-1990s with his Pennsylvania company Cyber Promotions. As a heavyset twentysomething with close-cropped hair and glasses, Wallace first spammed fax machines and then moved on to e-mail, believing that he had a legal right to market his wares as he saw fit. Dubbed “Spamford” by opponents, he eventually embraced the nickname and even registered the domain spamford.com. (In 1997, Hormel  sent him a letter objecting to the name on the grounds that it used the company’s potted meat SPAM trademark). Unlike other spammers who hid their identities, Wallace regularly tangled in public with antispam crusaders.</p><p>  这并没有阻止他在1990年代中期通过他在宾夕法尼亚州的公司Cyber​​ Promotions找到金钱上的成功和公众的恶名。华莱士是一个二十多岁的年轻人，戴着一头扎着头发和眼镜的短发，他首先给传真机发送垃圾邮件，然后转入电子邮件，他认为他拥有合法的权利来销售自己认为合适的商品。他被对手称为“ Spamford”，最终接受了这个昵称，甚至注册了spamford.com域。 （1997年，Hormel给他写了一封反对该名称的信，理由是该名称使用了该公司的盆栽肉类SPAM商标）。与其他隐藏身份的垃圾邮件发送者不同，华莱士经常在公共场合与反垃圾邮件巡逻者纠缠在一起。 </p><p> Cyber Promotions quickly became so hated that a dozen Internet service providers, including AOL, sued Wallace in the late 1990s, each hoping to halt his flood of junk e-mail despite the lack of antispam laws at the time. Wallace pressed on, but the lawsuits did cramp his business. He settled several of them by agreeing not to spam the particular network at issue, which gradually whittled down the list of places he could send spam without getting into more trouble.</p><p>网络促销迅速变得如此令人讨厌，以至于包括AOL在内的十几家互联网服务提供商在1990年代末起诉华莱士，尽管当时缺乏反垃圾邮件法律，但每个提供商都希望阻止他的垃圾电子邮件泛滥。华莱士坚持不懈，但诉讼确实限制了他的生意。他同意不对特定的网络发送垃圾邮件，从而解决了其中的一些问题，该网络逐渐减少了他可以发送垃圾邮件的位置列表，而不会造成更多麻烦。</p><p> Antispam vigilantes were also after him and his company. They hacked his website, replacing its homepage, and went after the Michigan Internet provider that served Cyber Promotions. As recounted in the 2004 book  Spam Kings by Brian McWilliams, Wallace was angry enough about the hacking to offer a $15,000 reward and claimed he was alerting the FBI.</p><p> 反垃圾邮件警戒人员也在追随他和他的公司。他们入侵了他的网站，替换了其主页，并追随为网络促销服务的密歇根州互联网提供商。正如布赖恩·麦克威廉姆斯（Brian McWilliams）在2004年出版的《垃圾邮件之王》（Spam Kings）一书中所说的那样，华莱士对黑客入侵感到非常生气，以提供15,000美元的奖励，并声称他正在向联邦调查局发出警报。</p><p>    By 1998, the pressure was so intense that Wallace had trouble finding an Internet provider to offer service to his company. In January, a local Philadelphia paper reported that Wallace had returned to his roots in junk faxing despite the fact that federal law now prohibited the practice. Local residents  were furious; one managed to get Cyber Promotions delisted from the Better Business Bureau.</p><p>    到1998年，压力变得如此之大，以至于华莱士（Wallace）很难找到可以为其公司提供服务的互联网提供商。一月份，费城当地的一份报纸报道说，尽管联邦法律现在禁止这种做法，但华莱士已经回到了垃圾传真领域。当地居民大怒；一位设法将网络促销从更好的商业局中删除。</p><p> In April 1998, Wallace publicly announced his “retirement” from spamming. After several more failed ventures and a failed marriage, he moved to New Hampshire and in January 2002 bought a nightclub called Plum Crazy from Walter Rines, a former spam partner. The club, just outside of Rochester, proved popular; few visitors knew that club owner DJ MasterWeb had such a colorful past.</p><p> 1998年4月，华莱士公开宣布从垃圾邮件中“退休”。在几家失败的企业和失败的婚姻之后，他搬到新罕布什尔州，并于2002年1月从前垃圾邮件合作伙伴Walter Rines那里买了一家名为Plum Crazy的夜总会。俱乐部位于罗切斯特（Rochester）外，很受欢迎。很少有游客知道俱乐部老板DJ MasterWeb拥有如此丰富多彩的过去。</p><p> When  Wired magazine  visited Plum Crazy in 2003, Wallace appeared to be a changed man. Those lawsuits from Internet providers hadn’t killed his business; “they put me into business—a business that worked,” he said at the time. Even top antispam lawyers were pleased to see the change of heart. The  Wired story included a line that at the time seemed perfectly sane: “I think the world of Sanford,” it quoted Pete Wellborn, an Atlanta attorney who won a $2 million judgment against Wallace on behalf of EarthLink in 1998. “He really is a man of his word, unlike the spammers we see now who are either ignorant or common criminals.”</p><p> 当《连线》杂志在2003年访问Plum Crazy时，华莱士似乎已经改变了。互联网提供商的这些诉讼并没有杀死他的生意；当时他说：“他们使我进入了业务领域，而且行之有效。”甚至顶级反垃圾邮件律师也很高兴看到心中的变化。 《连线》的故事包含了一条当时似乎很理智的话：“我认为是桑福德的世界，”它引述亚特兰大律师皮特·韦尔伯恩（Pete Wellborn）的话，他在1998年代表EarthLink赢得了针对华莱士的200万美元判决。他是一个有说服力的人，不像我们现在看到的垃圾邮件发送者，他们是无知的还是普通的罪犯。”</p><p>   But Wallace soon needed money. Plum Crazy went bankrupt; Wallace sold his house and moved to Las Vegas. He revived an older business of his called SmartBot and soon began a scheme in which he infected computers with spyware that then popped up messages selling an “antispyware program” to clean the infection. This finally moved the feds to action. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  filed suit against Wallace in 2004 to halt his SpamBot practices. FTC lawyers worked the case for two years and in March 2006 obtained a default judgment of $4 million when Wallace didn’t show up in court to contest the charges.</p><p>   但是华莱士很快就需要钱。梅子疯子破产了；华莱士卖掉了房子，搬到了拉斯维加斯。他恢复了一个叫做SmartBot的老公司，并很快开始了一个计划，用间谍软件感染计算机，然后弹出消息出售“反间谍程序”来清除感染。这最终使美联储采取了行动。联邦贸易委员会（FTC）于2004年对华莱士提起诉讼，要求中止其SpamBot行为。美国联邦贸易委员会的律师对该案进行了两年的调查，2006年3月，当华莱士未出庭应诉时，拖欠了400万美元的判决。</p><p> In October of that year, Wallace’s friend Rines was also hit with an injunction in an online marketing case. While this might have seemed like a good time for each man to lie low, the pair instead partnered again. They were soon at work on a new plan to make money marketing through the newly hot social networks. (The two “wasted little time in violating the Court’s Order” is how FTC lawyers later put it.) Their plan targeted the hugely popular MySpace site with the ultimate goal of directing MySpace users to websites advertising such things as ring tones and adult dating services.</p><p> 同年10月，华莱士的朋友雷恩（Rines）也因在线营销案件中的禁制令而受到打击。虽然这似乎是每个男人躺下的好时机，但两人却再次搭档。他们很快就正在制定一项新计划，以通过新的热门社交网络进行货币营销。 （FTC律师后来说这两个“浪费很少的时间来违反法院的命令”。）他们的计划针对了广受欢迎的MySpace网站，最终目的是将MySpace用户引导到广告铃声和成人约会服务之类的网站。 。 </p><p> Few people would click such low-quality links if they were clearly presented as ads. The beauty of the Wallace/Rines approach was that because their links appeared as messages from a MySpace user’s actual friends rather than as ads, clickthrough rates were high—as were profits. The FTC estimated that the scheme raked in at least $555,850.04 (the actual tally was probably higher).</p><p>如果将这些链接清晰地展示为广告，那么很少有人会点击这些链接。 Wallace / Rines方法的优点在于，由于它们的链接显示为来自MySpace用户实际朋友的消息而不是广告，因此点击率很高，利润也很高。 FTC估计该计划至少赚了555,850.04美元（实际金额可能更高）。</p><p>  The project showed real, if devious, creativity. In order to access people’s MySpace accounts, Wallace and Rines devised a plan to get people to hand over their account information. No subject was off-limits. Could the resurrection of Jesus somehow be used to generate money from sex sites? Yes, it could. In one memorable exploit, the pair used MySpace accounts they had created to send 392,726 unsolicited messages pitching Easter e-cards to other MySpace users. When the recipients clicked the link to view the online card, they were asked if they would like to “forward” the card to their own friends. They did so by entering their MySpace password and username into a form that looked a lot like the actual MySpace log-in page; Wallace and Rines would then add the accounts to their database. Later, they would log into these accounts and spam links to people’s friends, advertising whatever websites were willing to pay them. Visitors to the Easter e-card site who tried to leave the page without divulging their MySpace credentials were simply redirected to the advertising sites.</p><p>  该项目展现了真实的创造力。为了访问人们的MySpace帐户，Wallace和Rines制定了一项计划，要求人们交出其帐户信息。没有主题是禁止进入的。耶稣的复活可以以某种方式从性爱网站中赚钱吗？是的，可以。在一个令人难忘的漏洞利用中，他们俩使用自己创建的MySpace帐户向其他MySpace用户发送392,726条未经请求的消息，向他们发送复活节电子贺卡。收件人单击链接查看在线卡时，会询问他们是否要将卡“转发”给自己的朋友。他们通过将MySpace密码和用户名输入一种看起来与实际MySpace登录页面非常相似的表单来完成此操作。然后，华莱士和瑞恩斯将这些帐户添加到他们的数据库中。后来，他们登录了这些帐户，并向人们的朋友发送了垃圾邮件链接，宣传愿意向其付款的任何网站。试图在不泄露MySpace凭据的情况下离开页面的Easter电子贺卡站点的访问者仅被重定向到广告站点。</p><p>    Even for a network the size of MySpace, which had  50 million registered users in early 2006, Wallace quickly became a serious problem. As the technical side of the operation, he used automated tools to log in to more than 300,000 MySpace accounts and send more than 890,000 messages with links. The MySpace abuse team received more than 800 complaints about this behavior. In early 2007, the company filed a lawsuit against Wallace, and the FTC soon went after both men for violating the injunctions against more spamming. But Wallace defended his actions.</p><p>    即使对于MySpace规模的网络（在2006年初拥有5000万注册用户），华莱士也迅速成为一个严重的问题。作为操作的技术方面，他使用自动化工具登录了300,000多个MySpace帐户，并通过链接发送了890,000多条消息。 MySpace滥用小组收到了800多起有关此行为的投诉。在2007年初，该公司对华莱士（Wallace）提起诉讼，联邦贸易委员会（FTC）很快追捕了这两个人，因为他们违反了禁止更多垃圾邮件的禁令。但是华莱士为自己的行为辩护。</p><p> During his deposition with Frankel, the FTC lawyer, Wallace insisted that the messages he sent to other MySpace users weren’t “unsolicited” at all. This was the beauty of sending links from one MySpace user to the user’s friends. “A message between two friends is not defined as ‘unsolicited’ by several standards,” Wallace said. “If I call you up tomorrow and ask you if you’d like me to send you a document, is that an unsolicited phone call, or do we have an existing relationship?”</p><p> 华莱士在联邦贸易委员会律师弗兰克尔（Frankel）的证词中坚称，他发给其他MySpace用户的消息完全不是“未经请求”的。将链接从一个MySpace用户发送到该用户的朋友的美妙之处。华莱士说：“按照几个标准，两个朋友之间的信息并没有被定义为'未经请求的'。” “如果我明天打电话给您，问您是否要我发送文件，是不请自来的电话，还是我们已有关系？”</p><p> Besides, this wasn’t e-mail in the traditional technical sense, he said. “It’s not something coming from a stranger with a fake return address like the CAN-SPAM act is apparently trying to address... “This is friend to friend communication, and we don’t evade any type of friend to friend blocking techniques. We don’t trick in any way. We don’t trick people into getting messages from their friends. It’s based solely on their friend’s action [in giving log-in information to Wallace].” Wallace insisted that he had found a novel, legal way to market websites. “I’ve just been working with [Rines] on MySpace-related activities, advertising and Internet traffic and things of that sort, nothing in violation of your order,” he said.</p><p> 他说，此外，这不是传统技术意义上的电子邮件。 “这不是来自陌生人的虚假寄信人地址，例如CAN-SPAM法案显然试图解决……”“这是朋友间的交流，我们不会回避任何类型的朋友间封锁技术。我们绝不欺骗。我们不会欺骗人们从他们的朋友那里获取消息。这完全基于他们朋友的行为[向华莱士提供登录信息]。”华莱士坚持认为，他找到了一种新颖，合法的网站营销方法。他说：“我刚刚与[Rines]合作处理与MySpace相关的活动，广告和互联网流量以及类似的事情，没有违反您的订单的情况。”</p><p> Frankel let it go and turned to the question of the money. Why hadn’t Wallace paid the millions he owed the FTC? After all, Wallace had pulled in more than $4 million from SmartBot alone and was earning hundreds of thousands from his work on MySpace. Wallace insisted he was in debt, that he no longer had a credit card because “I basically could not pay off some of my credit card bills,” and that he had made big payments to six casinos for gambling debts—including $350,000 to the MGM Grand Mirage. But beyond that, he was maddeningly vague.</p><p> 弗兰克尔放开手，转向钱的问题。华莱士为什么不付他欠FTC的数百万美元呢？毕竟，华莱士仅从SmartBot中就获得了超过400万美元的收入，并且从他在MySpace上的工作中获得了数十万美元的收入。华莱士坚称自己负债累累，因为“我基本上无法偿还部分我的信用卡账单”而不再拥有信用卡，并且他已向六个赌场大笔赌博债务付款，其中包括向米高梅公司（MGM）支付的35万美元。大幻影。但是除此之外，他还发疯了。</p><p> He said he could not recall the amounts he had paid to other casinos. He claimed to have no real idea of the total income he had made over the years. And he could not explain what had happened to all of his money:</p><p> 他说，他不记得他已向其他赌场支付的金额。他声称对这些年来的总收入没有真正的想法。他无法解释他所有的钱怎么了： </p><p> Q. [Frankel] Well, here’s the kicker with all that. What happened to all this money? What happened to the $4 million plus, where is it today?</p><p>问：[法兰克]好吧，这就是所有这些。这笔钱怎么了？ 400万美元以上怎么了，今天在哪里呢？</p><p> A. [Wallace] Most of it was spent, I had debts and all this has to be—all this has to be reconciled through the use of this bank account which I would like to get cleared and taken care of with you, so that you can see exactly where the monies went. It’s all pretty much a pretty obvious story if you look at the bank.</p><p> 答：[华莱士]大部分钱都花光了，我有债，必须全部偿还，所有这些都必须通过使用我想清除并照顾您的这个银行帐户来核对。您可以确切看到款项去向。如果看银行的话，这几乎是一个显而易见的故事。</p><p> Q. What’s your—give me the general answer. What happened to the money? Right now you’re saying you have to show me documents, but where did the money go? Where is it? It’s a lot of money.</p><p> 问：您是什么人，请给我一般的答案。钱怎么了？现在，您说的是要给我看文件，但是钱去了哪里？它在哪里？钱很多</p><p> A. Yeah. I mean I had a lot of debt, and honestly I don’t know exactly where the money went. I would have to look at my bank account with you, and I’m not evading your question. I just don’t know how to give a general answer to that. And monies went out and came in for three years.</p><p> 答：是的。我的意思是我负债累累，老实说，我不知道这笔钱到底去了哪里。我将不得不与您一起查看我的银行帐户，但我没有回避您的问题。我只是不知道如何对此做出一般性回答。钱出去了三年。</p><p> Q. I’m not a rich guy, but if I had $4 million and I have nothing now, I would have at least some sense as to where the money went.</p><p> 问：我不是一个有钱人，但是如果我有400万美元，而现在却一无所有，那么我至少会对钱的去向有所了解。</p><p>   A. Again, this is a very impossible question for me to answer without having actual paperwork in front of me to go over specific itemization of what happened to the money and what didn’t happen to the money.</p><p>   答：同样，对于我来说，这是一个非常不可能的问题，如果没有我面前的实际文书工作来仔细检查一下钱发生了什么以及钱没有发生什么的具体项目。</p><p> Although he claimed that he currently had only $20,000 in a checking account, Wallace drove a $30,000 car with only 1,500 miles on it, had a $1,100-a-month apartment, and had just purchased a $1,400 watch. How did he afford it all, Frankel asked, on his $400-a-week DJ income? “I could not afford my rent if I did not have the other business,” Wallace admitted, referring to his MySpace activities.
