But flash back a few decades, and the leaders of those companies all would’ve gladly bowed down to Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, who began paving the way for everyone starting in 1957.</p><p>当您想到计算机行业的领导者时，您最初的想法可能转向苹果，微软和IBM等公司。但是回想几十年，这些公司的领导者都会很高兴地屈服于Digital Equipment Corporation（DEC），后者从1957年开始为所有人铺平道路。</p><p> DEC identified a demand for more affordable and high-performing computing systems that could be used in scientific research and other technological settings. DEC introduced a mid-range computing solution, the minicomputer, at a time when the alternative was too bulky and costly for most people.</p><p> DEC确定了对可用于科学研究和其他技术环境的价格更实惠且性能更高的计算系统的需求。 DEC推出了一种中端计算解决方案，即微型计算机，当时替代方案对于大多数人而言过于庞大且昂贵。</p><p>  In addition to its extensive lines of minicomputers, it also became involved with software as well as the internet (in the very, very early days of the internet).</p><p>  除了其广泛的小型计算机产品线之外，它还参与了软件以及互联网（在互联网的非常非常早期的时期）。</p><p> So, what happened to DEC? Why did all the success and industry dominance they had for roughly three decades just suddenly slip away? Most argue that it was a failure of the company’s leadership to adapt to the changing direction that computing began to take in the late 1980s.</p><p> 那么，DEC发生了什么？为什么过去三十年来所有的成功和行业主导地位突然消失了？大多数人认为，这是公司领导层无法适应1980年代后期开始改变计算方向的原因。</p><p> In order to understand how DEC eventually lost it all, it’s important to take a look back at how it all began and why such a monumental shift in the computing industry could’ve been missed by such a critical leader in the space.</p><p> 为了了解DEC最终是如何失去一切的，重要的是回顾一下一切是如何开始的，以及为什么这个领域的关键领导者会错过计算机行业如此巨大的转变。</p><p>  DEC’s story begins in 1957 with two men at  MIT who had a theory and an idea for a business. It ends in roughly 1998 with the selling of the company to Compaq. Here is DEC’s journey.</p><p>  DEC的故事始于1957年，当时有两个人在麻省理工学院工作，他们对商业有理论和想法。大约在1998年，公司被出售给了Compaq。这是DEC的旅程。</p><p>  While working together in the Lincoln Laboratory at MIT, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson came up with the idea for DEC. They took notice of how popular the interactive computing machines were with students who visited the lab, as opposed to the batch processing machines that users couldn’t input data into or use for real-time feedback.</p><p>  在麻省理工学院的林肯实验室工作时，肯·奥尔森和哈伦·安德森提出了DEC的想法。他们注意到交互式计算机在参观实验室的学生中的受欢迎程度，而不是用户无法将数据输入或用于实时反馈的批处理计算机。 </p><p> Olsen and Anderson also knew that these interactive machines could be made and sold cheaper, which would be another major draw for researchers and scientists who were craving the technology.</p><p>奥尔森（Olsen）和安德森（Anderson）也知道，这些交互式机器可以便宜地制造和销售，这将是渴望获得该技术的研究人员和科学家的又一主要吸引力。</p><p> After creating their original business plan, Olsen and Anderson were advised to shift the focus of their company from one around “computers” to instead one focused on “equipment.” There were just too many concerns from investors about the future of computing, and so that’s what they did. The plan for Digital Equipment Corporation was finalized and they received $70,000 to launch their new company.</p><p> 在创建了原始的业务计划后，建议奥尔森和安德森将公司的重点从“计算机”一词转移到“设备”一词上。投资者对计算机的未来充满了担忧，这就是他们所做的。最终确定了Digital Equipment Corporation的计划，他们获得了7万美元的资金来创办新公司。</p><p> In sticking with the theme of keeping expenses light (not only for customers but for the company as well), they set up shop in an old wool mill in Maynard, MA.</p><p> 为了保持低支出的主题（不仅对客户而且对公司而言），他们在马萨诸塞州Maynard的一家旧羊毛厂里开设了商店。</p><p>  The first product DEC created and sold was its Digital Laboratory Module. Staying true to its business plan, the initial product lines DEC focused on were modules, or electronic components, that were mounted to circuit boards. By the end of that year, DEC sold $94,000 worth of its first product.</p><p>  DEC创建并出售的第一个产品是其数字实验室模块。遵循其业务计划，DEC专注于最初的产品线是安装到电路板上的模块或电子组件。到那年年底，DEC售出了价值$ 94,000的第一款产品。</p><p>   DEC began selling its first computer at the end of 1960. But it was aware of people’s reluctance to invest in “computer” technology at the time, so it named the computer a “programmable data processor”, or PDP. The first iteration of this product line (PDP-1) sold for $120,000 that year.</p><p>   DEC于1960年底开始销售其第一台计算机。但是它意识到当时人们不愿投资“计算机”技术，因此将计算机命名为“可编程数据处理器”（PDP）。该产品线（PDP-1）的第一版在当年的售价为120,000美元。</p><p>    DEC began the process of creating “new” models of the PDP that could be sold for much less than the original. For example, the PDP-4 was similar in most ways to the PDP-1, but it was slower and packaged differently, which is what enabled DEC to sell it for $65,000.</p><p>    DEC开始创建PDP的“新”模型，该模型的售价可能远低于原始模型。例如，PDP-4在大多数方面与PDP-1相似，但速度较慢且包装不同，这使DEC能够以65,000美元的价格出售它。</p><p>  While continuing to release new PDPs into the market, DEC also charged forward in its delivery of new modules. The Flip Chip came out in 1964 and was meant to convert the PDP-4 to the PDP-7. Many of its subsequent module releases served a similar purpose: helping users convert their old computers to upgraded versions.</p><p>  在继续向市场发布新的PDP的同时，DEC还对新模块的交付进行了收费。倒装芯片于1964年问世，意在将PDP-4转换为PDP-7。其许多后续模块发行版也达到了类似的目的：帮助用户将旧计算机转换为升级版本。 </p><p>  It was in this year when DEC released the PDP-8, which is widely recognized as the first successful commercial minicomputer. Part of this is due to the improvements made to this model, but a large reason for its commercial success was the price tag of $18,500 and the 50,000 customers they sold it to.</p><p>DEC在今年发布了PDP-8，该产品被公认为第一台成功的商用小型计算机。部分原因是由于对该模型进行了改进，但其商业成功的主要原因是18,500美元的价格标签以及向其出售的50,000个客户。</p><p>  In the interim, DEC came up with a revamped version of their PDP line and released the PDP-11 minicomputer. Not only did it bring major upgraded features to their computing machines, it also was easier to use. By the time it stopped selling it in the 1990s, DEC sold over 600,000 of them, making it one of the most popular minicomputers ever.</p><p>  在此期间，DEC提出了他们的PDP生产线的改进版本，并发布了PDP-11微型计算机。它不仅为计算机带来了主要的升级功能，而且更易于使用。到1990年代停止销售时，DEC已售出60万台，使其成为有史以来最受欢迎的小型计算机之一。</p><p>  In addition, the design of the computer, as well as its operating system, turned out to be immensely popular with other computing companies, that eventually ended up using it as inspiration for their own work.</p><p>  此外，计算机的设计及其操作系统在其他计算公司中受到了极大的欢迎，最终这些计算机最终被其用作自己的工作灵感。</p><p>  DEC made its first move into the European market in 1971, setting up manufacturing in Ireland.</p><p>  DEC于1971年首次进入欧洲市场，并在爱尔兰建立了生产基地。</p><p>     After widespread success with its PDP-11, DEC made the move into high-end computers and launched the Virtual Address eXtension, or VAX. This new 32-bit minicomputer (or supermini) line aimed to provide users with a wide array of computing resources that would be more affordable, powerful, and smaller than what companies like IBM could offer at the time.</p><p>     在其PDP-11获得广泛成功之后，DEC进入了高端计算机市场，并推出了虚拟地址扩展（VAX）。这条新的32位小型机（或超小型机）产品线旨在为用户提供各种各样的计算资源，这些资源将比IBM之类的公司当时提供的价格便宜，功能强大且体积更小。</p><p>  The Rainbow 100 was created and was DEC’s first attempt to enter the personal computing space.</p><p>  Rainbow 100诞生了，它是DEC首次进入个人计算领域。</p><p>  DEC continued to stay busy during this time, regularly putting out new models of the VAX. The VAX 8600 came out in 1984 and became an instant bestseller.</p><p>  DEC在此期间继续保持忙碌状态，定期推出新型号的VAX。 VAX 8600于1984年问世，立即成为畅销书。 </p><p>    DEC was recognized as one of the premier leaders in computing when it was named the second largest computer company, just behind IBM. At the time, it had generated over $11 billion in revenue and had over 120,000 employees.</p><p>DEC被评为仅次于IBM的第二大计算机公司，被公认为计算领域的主要领导者之一。当时，它的收入超过110亿美元，拥有12万多名员工。</p><p>        DEC released Alpha AXP, which was a 64-bit microprocessor created to solve the overly complicated circuit designs of its VAX computers and to ultimately speed up processing times.</p><p>        DEC发行了Alpha AXP，这是一个64位微处理器，旨在解决其VAX计算机过于复杂的电路设计并最终加快处理时间。</p><p>  DEC launched AltaVista, one of the first ever search engines for the Internet. It became incredibly popular with users. During the first day of its launch, AltaVista received 300,000 visits. Two years later, it received 80 million hits every day.</p><p>  DEC推出了AltaVista，这是互联网上最早的搜索引擎之一。它变得非常受用户欢迎。在发布的第一天，AltaVista接待了300,000人次。两年后，它每天获得8000万次点击。</p><p>  Although  AltaVista persisted long past the end or, more accurately, the acquisition of DEC, it was eventually sold to Yahoo in 2003. By the time 2013 rolled around, it was gone.</p><p>  尽管AltaVista坚持了很长时间，或更确切地说是收购DEC，但最终还是在2003年被卖给了Yahoo。到2013年左右时，它就消失了。</p><p>  Other computer companies began to make moves for the flailing DEC. Intel was the first to step in when it purchased DEC’s microprocessor plant in Hudson. But even that $1.5 billion wasn’t enough to save the company.</p><p>  其他计算机公司也开始采取行动以应对日益严重的DEC问题。英特尔收购DEC在哈德森的微处理器工厂时是第一个涉足的公司。但是，即使那15亿美元也不足以挽救公司。</p><p>  The official end of DEC as a standalone company came in 1998 when it was acquired by Compaq for $9.6 billion. Unfortunately, Compaq didn’t know what to do with DEC’s overseas business, and so it was inevitable that neither DEC nor Compaq would exist for much longer. That day came in 2002 when Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq.</p><p>  DEC正式正式独立，始于1998年，当时它被Compaq以96亿美元的价格收购。不幸的是，康柏不知道与DEC的海外业务有何关系，因此DEC和Compaq都不存在更长的时间是不可避免的。那天是2002年，惠普收购了康柏。</p><p>  It’s been many decades since the world was first introduced to DEC, and tech history buffs still enjoy talking about it.</p><p>  自DEC首次引入世界以来已有数十年了，技术历史爱好者仍然喜欢谈论它。 </p><p> Why? First, because it left such a lasting imprint on computing as we continue to know it, whether it was its contributions to computers, software, microchips, or even the internet itself.</p><p>为什么？首先，因为它在我们继续了解的计算机上留下了如此持久的烙印，无论它是对计算机，软件，微芯片乃至互联网本身的贡献。</p><p> Second, because there is an important lesson here that every computer company should carefully study if they don’t want to fall victim to the same fate.</p><p> 其次，因为这里有一个重要的教训，每个计算机公司都应该认真研究是否不想成为同一命运的受害者。</p><p> In a Quora thread that asked the question “ Why did Digital Equipment Corporation fail?” it was interesting to see so many previous DEC employees and members of the MIT community speak up about what they noted during their tenure there. Almost unanimously, they supported the theory—also commonly held by experts—that the failure of the company ultimately fell to the leaders who were unable to foresee what was coming in personal computing and were not able to take decisive or quick enough action in time to save the company.</p><p> 在Quora主题中，提出了一个问题：“为什么Digital Equipment Corporation失败？”有趣的是，看到如此多的DEC以前的雇员和MIT社区的成员谈论他们在任职期间的注意事项。几乎一致地，他们支持专家普遍认为的理论，即公司的失败最终归咎于那些无法预见个人计算机即将出现的情况并且无法及时采取果断或足够迅速的行动的领导者。拯救公司。</p><p>  Perhaps the saddest thing about this is that DEC had long been considered the “best” and the inspiratioan for what so many after them set out to do. It’s not like it hadn’t made an attempt at personal computing when they released their Rainbow 100. So, how did it fail to see that the future of the mid-market minicomputer was waning and that a full shift over to personal computers was needed in order to ensure the company’s longevity?</p><p>  也许最可悲的是，DEC长期以来一直被认为是“最好的”，也是许多人着手去做之后的灵感。并不是说他们发布Rainbow 100时就没有尝试过个人计算。因此，它怎么看不到中型市场小型计算机的未来正在消退，需要完全转向个人计算机呢？为了保证公司的长寿？</p><p> According to  Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School, it wasn’t a lack of trying that took down DEC. It was the inflexibility of the business model they had so long relied upon:</p><p> 根据哈佛商学院教授克莱顿·克里斯滕森（Clayton Christensen）的说法，DEC的成功不乏尝试。他们长期以来一直依赖的商业模式缺乏灵活性：</p><p> “Digital Equipment Corp. had microprocessor technology, but its business model could not profitably sell a computer for less than $50,000. The technology trapped in a high-cost business model had no impact on the world, and in fact, the world ultimately killed Digital. But IBM Corp., with the very same processors at its disposal, set up a different business model in Florida that could make money at a $2,000 price point and 20% gross margins—and changed the world.”</p><p> “ Digital Equipment Corp.拥有微处理器技术，但其商业模式无法以低于50,000美元的价格出售计算机。被困在高成本商业模式中的技术对世界没有影响，实际上，世界最终杀死了Digital。但是拥有相同处理器的IBM Corp.在佛罗里达建立了不同的商业模式，该商业模式可以以2,000美元的价格和20％的毛利率实现盈利，从而改变了世界。”</p><p> Regardless of why it happened or how the leadership behind DEC allowed it to happen, the legacy of this company will live on as it was willing to step up and introduce affordable and powerful computing solutions during a time when others were too afraid to.</p><p> 不管它为什么发生，还是DEC背后的领导如何允许它发生，这家公司的遗产将继续存在，因为它愿意在其他人太害怕的时候加紧并推出负担得起且功能强大的计算解决方案。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/去世/">#去世</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/tale/">#tale</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dec/">#dec</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
