Some chipmakers view this as a competitive opportunity, but others are unsure we fully understand how those devices will age.</p><p>电路老化是由于终端市场的SWATH的强制性设计问题，特别是在预期节点芯片预期超过几年的市场中。一些芯片制造商认为这是一个竞争的机会，但其他人不确定我们完全了解这些设备如何年龄。</p><p> Aging is the latest in a long list of issues being pushed further left in the design flow. In the past, the fab hid many of these problems from design teams. But as margin shrinks at each new node, the onus has shifted to the design side to solve the problems earlier in the flow, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of back-end implementation software and sign-off tools. And power and thermal issues have become so constraining that they have been pushed even further forward in the development flow, starting at the architecture level.</p><p> 老化是在设计流程中进一步推动的长期问题的最新状态。在过去，工厂隐藏着来自设计团队的许多问题。但作为每个新节点的边缘缩小，ONU已经转移到设计方面，以解决流程中的问题，如前端实现软件和签出工具的广泛采用所证明。电力和热问题已经变得如此约束，即在开发流程中甚至进一步推动了它们，从架构水平开始。</p><p> Reliability is the latest concern to surface, and while it may not be as prominent yet, it is no less important. Left unchecked, devices may not survive their intended lifetime, a problem made worse by the fact that many of these devices are expected to last longer today than in the past. Reputations are at stake across the supply chain. On top of that, in-field replacements are expensive. And margining, the traditional approach to improving reliability, makes those products uncompetitive at advanced nodes.</p><p> 可靠性是表面的最新担忧，而虽然它可能不如突出，但它并不不重要。未选中，设备可能无法在其预期的寿命中存活，这是一个问题所造成的，其中许多这些设备预计今天比过去持续时间更长。声誉是在供应链中的股权。最重要的是，现场替代品很昂贵。和边缘，传统的提高可靠性方法，使这些产品在高级节点上没有竞争力。</p><p> “Aging has long been considered by designers in high-reliability design areas,” says Stephen Crosher, director for SLM strategic programs at  Synopsys. “Maybe they were designing for particular applications, such as automotive, or for extreme stress environments. But it wasn’t necessarily a mainstream consideration for designers. Now it is transitioning into normal practice, and your standard designer will need to become aware of it.”</p><p> “长期以来一直考虑了高可靠性设计领域的设计师长期考虑，”Synopsys的SLM战略计划总监Stephen Crosher说。 “也许他们正在为特定的应用设计，例如汽车，或极其压力环境。但这并不一定是设计师的主流考虑因素。现在它正在转变为正常做法，您的标准设计师需要了解它。“</p><p> Several factors are changing. “In more advanced nodes and with increasing speed requirements, it has become much more of a critical design consideration,” says Ashraf Takla, president and CEO of  Mixel. “The aging impact needs to be evaluated and accounted for in timing budget early in the design stage, and verification needs to be done to ensure the final budget meets aging budgets.”</p><p> 有几个因素正在发生变化。 “在更先进的节点和增加的速度要求中，它已经成为一个重要的设计考虑因素，”Mileel总裁兼首席执行官Ashraf Takla说。 “需要在设计阶段的早期时间预算中进行评估和占时效，需要进行核查，以确保最终预算符合老龄预算。”</p><p> The importance of addressing aging has spread beyond just safety-critical and mission-critical applications. “Several of our IP providers, especially on the lower process technology nodes, are asking about aging models and the aging capability of EDA simulation,” says Greg Curtis, product manager for Analog FastSPICE at  Siemens EDA. “It is not just automotive anymore. We’re seeing it in mobile communications, we’re seeing it in Internet of Things. It is becoming good practice that companies start looking at the aging of their IP.”</p><p> 解决老龄化的重要性差异超出了安全关键和关键任务申请。 “我们的几个知识产权提供商，特别是在较低的过程技术节点上，询问了EDA仿真的老化模型和老化能力，”西门子EDA的模拟斯法利斯产品经理Greg Curtis说。 “这不仅仅是汽车了。我们在移动通信中看到它，我们在物联网上看到它。这正变得良好的练习，公司开始看着他们的知识产权的老化。“</p><p> For many companies, this is unavoidable. “The largest variability factor that impacts lifetime is temperature,” says Brian Philofsky, principal technical marketing engineer at  Xilinx. “Operating electronics at reduced temperatures often has a measurable effect on the lifetime and aging of the circuits. Another factor an engineer has control over within the device is the amount of current consumed. Higher current draw can significantly reduce lifetime due to  electromigration and other undesirable effects. Unfortunately, modern circuit design is put at odds as compute density increases with every node shrink. Simultaneously, the reduced voltage has the impact of increasing current draw within the same power envelope. Over the last few years, the trend is higher operating currents at higher operating temperatures, which makes reliability more challenging.”</p><p> 对于许多公司来说，这是不可避免的。 “Xilinx的主要技术营销工程师Brian Philofsky说：”影响寿命的最大可变异因素是温度。“ “在降低的温度下操作电子器件通常对电路的寿命和老化具有可测量的影响。工程师在设备内控制的另一个因素是所消耗的电流量。由于电迁移和其他不希望的效果，电流较高的速度可以显着减少寿命。遗憾的是，当每个节点收缩时，现代电路设计符合计算密度的增加。同时，降低的电压具有增加电流绘制在相同动力包络内的影响。在过去的几年里，趋势更高的工作电流在更高的工作温度下，使可靠性更具挑战性。“ </p><p> Geometry impact While the underlying mechanisms that cause aging have not changed, their importance has become more significant at each new process node. “Reliability is related to device size, and in particular the channel length,” says Jushan Xie, senior software architect at  Cadence. “As the channel length gets shorter, the effects become more pronounced. The electric field inside the channel can become strong. Devices at 45nm and below have to consider reliability.”</p><p>几何影响，而导致老化的潜在机制没有改变，它们的重要性在每个新的过程节点都变得更加重要。 “可靠性与设备尺寸相关，特别是渠道长度，”Cadence的高级软件架构师Jushan谢说。 “随着频道长度变短，效果变得更加明显。通道内的电场可以变强。 45nm和以下的设备必须考虑可靠性。“</p><p> That does not mean that designs at older nodes can safely ignore the impacts. “While it is more predominant in advanced technology nodes, such as 28nm and below, we have seen it on 40nm devices as well,” says Ahmed Ramadan, AMS foundry relations manager at Siemens EDA. “Recently, specialty foundries that are providing technologies on the 130nm and 180nm nodes are starting to consider providing aging models for their customers. This is coming because of pressure from the customers. It is a need they are seeing in the type of designs and applications that are working on.”</p><p> 这并不意味着旧节点的设计可以安全地忽略影响。 “虽然在高级技术节点中更为优势，如28nm及以下，但我们也在40nm的设备上看到它，”西门子EDA的Ahmed Ramadan说，Ahmed Ramadan说。 “最近，在130nm和180nm节点上提供技术的专业代工厂开始考虑为客户提供老化模型。由于来自客户的压力，这即将到来。他们需要在正在处理的设计和应用程序中看到。“</p><p> New device technologies are making it a larger issue. “At 28nm, people already were aware of some of the mechanisms of over-stressing devices,” says Oliver King, director of engineering at Synopsys. “Gates were very thin. They were susceptible to being overstressed. Along with continued shrinking of dimensions, designs switched to  finFETs, which bring in new mechanisms such as the fin structure, and this just made it much more prominent.”</p><p> 新的设备技术正在提出更大的问题。 “在28纳姆，人们已经了解了过度强调设备的一些机制，”Synopsys的工程总监Oliver King说。 “门非常薄。他们易于过度感受。随着尺寸的持续缩小，设计切换到FinFET，它带来了翅片结构的新机制，这只是使其更加突出。“</p><p> One of the big problems is that not everything scales equally in new geometries. “You are scaling the dimensions of the length and the width of the transistors,” says Siemens’s Ramadan. “But you’re not able to scale the gate oxide at the same pace. This is going to add additional stress on the device. You’re not able to scale the voltage at the same pace because scaling the voltage will not leave enough room above the threshold voltage of the device. This increase the amount of stress that the device will be facing.”</p><p> 其中一个很大问题是，并非一切都在新几何形状中平均衡量。 “你正在缩放晶体管的长度和宽度的尺寸，”西门子的斋月说。 “但是你无法以同样的速度缩放栅极氧化物。这将为设备添加额外的压力。您无法以相同的速度扩展电压，因为缩放电压不会留出足够高于设备的阈值电压的足够的空间。这增加了设备将面临的应力量。“</p><p> Gate scaling without voltage scaling is a huge issue. “If the average transistor is consuming the same amount of current as older transistors on larger nodes, then by scaling device density you’ve increased the power density,” says Synopsys’ Crosher. “That relates to heat, and heat can be the big culprit in this equation. Self-heating in finFETs is also contributing to this. The transition from planar into finFET is where we really starting to see those sort of stress issues applying to consumer products and broadening the concerns for reliability. They are exposing themselves to those kind of stress conditions, which need to be mitigated to try and get any reasonable lifetime from those devices.”</p><p> 没有电压缩放的门缩放是一个巨大的问题。 “如果平均晶体管在较大节点上消耗与旧晶体管相同的电流，则通过缩放设备密度来增加功率密度，”Synopsys'Crosher说。 “与热量有关，热量可以是该等方程式中的大罪魁祸首。 Finfets的自我加热也为此有所贡献。从平面到Finfet的过渡是我们真正开始看到那些适用于消费产品的压力问题，并扩大对可靠性的担忧。他们正在将自己暴露在那种压力条件下，需要减轻这些压力条件，以试图从这些设备中获得任何合理的寿命。“</p><p> This gets even more complicated as more die are included in the same package. In the past, process-related issues could be solved with enough volume and time. But many of the advanced package implementations are unique, and the chips within them may age at different rates.</p><p> 随着更多的DIE包含在同一包装中，这会变得更加复杂。在过去，可以通过足够的体积和时间来解决进程相关的问题。但许多先进的包实现是唯一的，而其中内部的芯片可能会以不同的速率增长。</p><p> “The biggest problem we see is the huge number of implementation options,” said Andy Heinig, group leader for advanced system integration and department head for efficient electronics at  Fraunhofer IIS’ Engineering of Adaptive Systems Division. “It’s not clear how you compare these different options. Chip design is easier if you have previous chip generations that are similar. But now we have a huge range of options, both for packages and the software within them.”</p><p> “我们看到的最大问题是实现选项的大量实施方式，”Andy Heinig，Andy Heinig，Anderation Electorics Adaptive Systems Division of Adaptive Systems部门的高效电子产品。 “这不清楚如何比较这些不同的选项。如果您拥有类似的芯片世代，芯片设计更容易。但现在我们有一系列巨大的选择，包括包中的包和软件。“ </p><p> The number of things that can go wrong increases inside a package, as well. “There is mechanical stress, in addition to warpage, and the potential for thermal mismatch,” said Marc Swinnen, director of product marketing at  Ansys. “You also still have to get the power from Chip A to Chip B. Even if a bump fails, you still have to get the power through. But if you have a current spike as a result of this, other bumps can fail, too.”</p><p>在包装内部可能出现问题的事情的数量也会增加。 “除了翘曲和热不匹配的潜力之外，还有机械压力，”ANSYS产品营销总监MARC SWINNEN说。 “您仍然必须从芯片A到芯片B的电力。即使凹凸失败，您仍然必须通过。但如果您有当前飙升，其他颠簸也会失败。“</p><p> Understanding how the various pieces goes together requires much more in-depth analysis throughout the design process.</p><p> 了解各种碎片如何结合在一起需要在整个设计过程中深入分析。</p><p> Aging models Analysis starts with suitable models and it can be tricky to model phenomena that may not be fully understood. “There’s an element of we don’t actually know whether the models are accurate enough,” says Synopsys’ King. “Ultimately the models predict a certain aging for a given circuit. And only really time will tell whether they were correct in that prediction. It is a complicated issue. It’s not just the aging mechanisms that we already know about. It’s also self-heating effects, process variations, Monte Carlo, and other effects that you need to take into account as part of analyzing any given circuit. Maybe the models are right, maybe they’re not.”</p><p> 老化模型分析以合适的型号开始，它可能是棘手的模型现象，可能无法完全理解。 “我们实际上没有知道模型是否足够准确，”Synopsys'king说。 “最终模型预测给定电路的某个老化。只有真正的时间会告诉他们是否在这种预测中是正确的。这是一个复杂的问题。这不仅仅是我们已经了解的老化机制。它也是自我加热效果，过程变化，蒙特卡罗以及您需要考虑的其他效果，作为分析任何给定电路的一部分。也许模型是对的，也许他们不是。“</p><p> It can be easy to dismiss the state of the industry, but it has to work with something. “We have not seen any indication that the models are inadequate,” says Mixel’s Takla. “That said, foundries, in cooperation with tool providers, are continuously tweaking their aging models to improve accuracy based on silicon measurements.”</p><p> 可以容易地解除行业的状态，但它必须与某些东西合作。 “我们没有看到任何迹象表明模型不足，”Mixel的Takla说。 “如此，铸造厂与工具提供商合作，不断调整其老化模型，以提高基于硅测量的准确性。”</p><p> While techniques like burn-in have been successful for traditional devices, it is not known how exactly they apply to these new effects. “You cannot wait for 10 years. You have to find ways to get the results you need quicker,” says Cadence’s Xie. “You will be using some theory or equations for acceleration and you want to get some equivalent to 10 years of aging in a short period of time. Calibration is important, and there are theories about how to accelerate aging.”</p><p> 虽然如烧坏的技术已经成功地为传统设备成功，但它尚不清楚他们究竟适用于这些新效果。 “你不能等待10年。您必须找到更快地获得所需结果的方法，“Cadence的谢说。 “您将使用一些理论或方程进行加速，并且您希望在短时间内获得相当于10年的老龄化。校准很重要，有关于如何加速老化的理论。“</p><p> The industry is trying to reach consensus. “I’ve been working with  Compact Model Coalition (CMC) for more than 20 years,” says Ramadan. “It was probably 7 years ago when we first started having discussions about a standard aging model. At that time, we were not able to converge on a single standard for hot-carrier injection (HCI) or  negative-bias thermal instability (NBTI) that would satisfy all foundries and designs communities. They felt they had to make customization and modification to fit their processes.”</p><p> 该行业正试图达成共识。 “我一直在使用紧凑型模型联盟（CMC）超过20年，”斋月说。 “这可能是7年前，我们第一次开始讨论标准老化模型。此时，我们无法收敛于热载波注射（HCI）的单个标准或负面偏置热不稳定性（NBTI），这将满足所有刚刚的刚性和设计社区。他们觉得他们必须定制和修改以适应他们的流程。“</p><p> But that can leave device companies holding the ball. “We guarantee our commercial devices for 10 years of operation when maintained within its operating specifications,” says Xilinx’s Philofsky. “There are two situations that may require further consideration or analysis — a design requiring an operating lifetime greater than 10 years, or a design that may exceed the operating conditions and wishes to understand impacts to the lifetime. In these situations, we have simulation models, analysis tools, and reliability data that can be used and applied to specific operating conditions for particular devices. This can fine-tune the lifetime specifications, sometimes allowing for a more efficient operating range. We’ve done this for decades and evolved our models to the point of having a high degree of confidence in them. Yet we are continuously improving them based on the latest theoretical and empirical data collected.”</p><p> 但这可以留下持有球的设备公司。 “我们保证我们的商业设备在其运营规范内维护时为10年的操作，”Xilinx的Philofsky说。 “有两种情况可能需要进一步考虑或分析 - 一个需要经营寿命的设计大于10年，或者可能超过操作条件的设计，并希望了解终身影响的影响。在这些情况下，我们具有仿真模型，分析工具和可靠性数据，可用于特定设备的特定操作条件。这可以微调寿命规格，有时允许更有效的操作范围。几十年来，我们已经这样做了，并将我们的模型进化到对它们的高度信心。然而，根据收集的最新理论和经验数据，我们不断改进它们。“ </p><p> Work continues within the CMC. “Still not yet there,” says Ramadan. “Each and every foundry and design house is creating its own models. Some of them are initially physics-based models. But there are a lot of empirical formulations that also are taking place in order to be able to fit their current process and the target applications. How confident are we in these models? We should be confident enough for them to give a good estimate for the amount of degradation that’s going to happen on the device.”</p><p>工作在CMC内继续。 “还没有，”斋月说。 “每个和每个铸造和设计房屋都在创造自己的模型。其中一些是最初是物理的模型。但是，还有很多实证制剂也在进行，以便能够符合其目前的过程和目标应用。我们在这些模型中有多自信？我们应该对他们充满信心，以便对设备发生的劣化估计估计。“</p><p> Even with accurate models, there are other sources of inaccuracy. “The nature of aging simulation itself utilizes a lot of approximations,” Ramadan notes. “Consider that you run the simulation for aging over a short period of time, and then you do an extrapolation for the intended period. With this extrapolation there’s a lot of approximations. But so far, we didn’t hear any complaints from customers that the models provided by the customers in terms of aging are far off. These things will need some years to validate. If you are actually running aging analysis today, you need maybe five years to make sure that what happened in real life is actually correct.”</p><p> 即使有准确的模型，也有其他不准确的来源。 “老化模拟本身的性质利用大量近似值”，“斋月票据。 “考虑在短时间内运行老化的模拟，然后您为预期期间进行外推。通过这种推断，有很多近似值。但到目前为止，我们没有听到客户的任何投诉，客户在老化方面由客户提供的模型很远。这些事情需要多年来才能验证。如果您今天实际上运行老化分析，您需要五年，以确保现实生活中发生的事情实际上是正确的。“</p><p> Aging cannot be considered on its own. “Variability also plays a part,” says Crosher. “It goes hand in hand with increased gate density, the manufacturing process and greater variability. We haven’t seen them mature in the field for 15 years to actually know what the aging impacts and effects are. So that’s why there is a reliance, and a critical need, that within advanced devices you need some form of embedded sensing to try and manage those issues. If you can measure the conditions of the chip in real time and see how devices are degrading and how they’re aging, then they are able to take some mitigating steps to try and manage that.”</p><p> 衰老不能自己考虑。 “变异性也发挥了一部分，”克罗赫说。 “它随着栅极密度增加，制造过程和更大的变化而携手即用。我们在现场没有看到它们成熟15年，实际上知道老化的影响和效果是什么。因此，这就是为什么有依赖的为什么，在高级设备中，您需要某种形式的嵌入式感应，以尝试和管理这些问题。如果您可以实时测量芯片的条件，并查看设备如何降级以及如何老化，那么他们就可以采取一些缓解步骤来尝试管理。“</p><p> He’s not alone in identifying this as an issue. Fraunhofer’s Heinig pointed to system variation as one of the big challenges as more devices are integrated into systems and into packages, and as those devices are expected to last longer in the field. “There are no tools today to solve this problem,” he said. “It’s difficult to verify, because with software updates the product also changes over time.”</p><p> 他并不孤单地将其视为一个问题。 Fraunhofer的Heinig指出系统变化作为大量挑战之一，因为更多的设备被集成到系统和包装中，并且由于这些设备预计将在该领域持续更长时间。 “今天没有工具来解决这个问题，”他说。 “很难验证，因为软件更新产品也随时间变化。”</p><p>  Where to focus Digital and analog will be affected differently, as will devices subject to frequent change — and in some cases, infrequent change. “Any place where there’s a lot of activity will be more sensitive to device aging,” says Art Schaldenbrand, senior product manager at Cadence. “For devices, you can look at the clock tree and look at what is happening. Digital designs are sensitive to delay changes. The other place where this becomes a challenge is within analog designs. An example would be in a bias tree. With the bias transistors moving and aging, it can potentially accelerate the aging of other devices in the bias network. There’s always going to be some different elements in the design, and you have to look at them a little bit differently to be able to analyze the reliability.”</p><p>  将数字和模拟集中的在哪里会受到不同的影响，因此设备经常发生变化 - 在某些情况下，不常见的变化。 “任何有很多活动的地方都对设备老化更敏感，”Cadence的高级产品经理Schaldenbrand说。 “对于设备，您可以查看钟表树，查看正在发生的事情。数字设计对延迟变化很敏感。另一个地方成为挑战的另一个地方是模拟设计。一个例子将是偏置树。利用偏置晶体管移动和老化，它可以潜在地加速偏置网络中的其他设备的老化。设计中总是有一些不同的元素，你必须用不同的方式看待它们，以便能够分析可靠性。“</p><p> Designs that employ dynamic voltage and frequency scaling may have to be very careful. “Problems often arise when you are trying to optimize devices, maybe reducing supplies,” says King. “It may be tied to adaptive voltage schemes, and it is a question of how low you can go on the supply, with your logic still meeting timing. There could be designs that push the supply up when they detect that they need to. If performance drop off can’t be corrected, then at least a graceful bow-out may be an important design consideration.”</p><p> 采用动态电压和频率缩放的设计可能必须非常小心。 “当您尝试优化设备时，可能会出现问题，可能会减少供应，”King说。 “它可能与自适应电压方案相关联，这是一个问题，您可以在电源上进行多少，逻辑仍会会议时间。当他们检测到它们需要时，可能会有设计。如果无法纠正性能下降，那么至少一个优雅的漏油可能是一个重要的设计考虑因素。“</p><p> Sensitivity analysis is one way to approach the problem. “Let’s say that there is a certain design parameter they are concerned about, such as the gain for an amplifier,” says Ramadan. “They would want to see how sensitive each transistor is, contributing to change on that gain. Then they can consider the change in the threshold voltage or Ids due to aging. With sensitivity analysis, they can understand how big the impact of aging will be on specific devices in the design compared to the rest of the devices, and then start doing some guarding for those.”</p><p> 敏感性分析是解决问题的一种方法。 “让我们说他们担心的某种设计参数，例如放大器的增益，”斋月说。 “他们希望看到每个晶体管的敏感程度，有助于改变该增益。然后，他们可以考虑由于老化引起的阈值电压或ID的变化。随着敏感性分析，他们可以了解老化的影响与设备的其余部分相比，老化的影响是多大的，然后开始为那些保护一些保护。“ </p><p> But you have to be careful to consider all of the important areas. “There is a phenomenon called non-conductive stress,” says Cadence’s Schaldenbrand. “Consider a device such as a watch dog or monitor. It will be sitting idle, potentially for years, and you want it to spring into action if there’s some sort of condition that occurs. Even those circuits, that you think are you’re just sitting there doing nothing, are being stressed. They can age and potentially fail due to the aging that occurs while they’re sitting idle.”</p><p>但是你必须小心考虑所有重要地区。 “有一种叫做非导电压力的现象，”Cadence的Schaldenbrand说。 “考虑一个手表狗或监视器等设备。它将闲置，可能多年来，如果发生了某种情况，您希望它能够春天进入行动。即使是那些电路，你认为你只是坐在那里没有什么，都会受到压力。由于它们坐在闲着时发生的老化，它们可以年龄和可能失败。“</p><p> How to tackle the issue There are several ways to take the issues into account during the design, implementation and sign-off stages of development. Schaldenbrand lists three levels of analysis that can be performed:</p><p> 如何解决问题的问题，在设计，实施和签署阶段的设计，实施和签名期间有几种方法会考虑到账户。 Schaldenbrand列出了三个可以执行的分析级别：</p><p> Monitoring conditions a device operates under. This is effectively monitoring things like the electric field by looking at device size and other factors. These checks are called device asserts. It may show that a device sees a lot of voltage, so it’s a place that is sensitive, and a potential problem.</p><p> 监控条件设备在下面运行。这通过查看设备尺寸和其他因素来有效地监视电场等事物。这些检查称为设备断言。它可能表明设备看到大量电压，因此它是一个敏感的地方，并且是潜在的问题。</p><p> Run analysis. You can conduct aging analysis and say a device will operate under certain conditions for a given time period, and at the end of life it will have certain characteristics. If you do corner analysis, or Monte Carlo analysis, you also can do aging analysis at the same time.</p><p> 运行分析。您可以进行老化分析并说设备将在某些条件下运行给定的时间段，并且在生命结束时它将具有一定的特点。如果您进行角落分析或蒙特卡罗分析，您也可以同时进行老化分析。</p><p> Gradual aging. This makes piece-wise approximations for an operating lifetime. Usually, designers are relatively experienced and know which blocks are more sensitive to those kinds of phenomena. You do not have to run those tests everywhere because they tend to be relatively expensive.</p><p> 渐渐老化。这使得操作寿命的分词近似。通常，设计师相对经历，并知道哪些块对这些种类的现象更敏感。您无需随时随地运行这些测试，因为它们往往相对昂贵。</p><p> Process migration is becoming expensive. “For every process migration, say from 16nm to 10, to 7, to 5nm, all the way down to 3nm, every process node according to our customers requires three times more simulations because of the additional PVT corners they need to run,” says Siemens’ Curtis. “It puts a tremendous burden on their simulation needs to ensure first time silicon success.”</p><p> 流程迁移变得昂贵。 “对于每个进程迁移，比如16nm到10，到7，到5nm，一直到3nm，每个过程节点根据我们的客户需要三倍的模拟，因为他们需要运行的额外PVT角，”说西门子的柯蒂斯。 “它对他们的模拟需要巨大的负担，以确保第一次硅成功。”</p><p> But even this level of analysis does not provide certainty. “Reliability is statistical,” says Xie. “You need to look at it as a Monte Carlo problem. You have 100 devices, and they are identical when first fabricated. Even if you apply the same stress to those devices over 10 years, and measure the device degradation, it will have a distribution. This distribution for relative aging is not being considered by most companies.”</p><p> 但即使是这种分析水平也没有提供确定性。 “可靠性是统计学，”谢说。 “你需要把它视为一个蒙特卡洛问题。您有100个设备，并且在首次伪造时它们是相同的。即使您对10年超过10年的设备对这些设备应用相同的压力，并测量设备劣化，它将具有分布。大多数公司都没有考虑相对老化的这种分布。“ </p><p> Nobody wants to design for worst case. “When you embed sensors, you don’t have to predict aging,” says King. “You can measure it. You can see what is aging and make adjustments to that circuit, or highlight that the chip is close to failure and make the decision to go into a safe state. That may enable you to pull a failing computer from a data center, or ensure safe operation of your self-driving car.”</p><p>没有人想为最坏的情况设计。 “当你嵌入传感器时，你不必预测老化，”King说。 “你可以衡量它。您可以看到衰老以及对该电路进行调整，或者突出显示芯片接近故障，并决定进入安全状态。这可能使您能够从数据中心提取失败的计算机，或确保自动驾驶汽车的安全操作。“</p><p> Built-in analysis can be changed over time. “Xilinx provides a system monitor circuit to allow users to monitor temperature and voltage to ensure safe operation,” says Philofsky. “Having programmability for the device will enable us to further extend this measurement and allow a more comprehensive view of reliability over many fixed-function devices.”</p><p> 随着时间的推移，可以改变内置分析。 “Xilinx提供了一个系统监控电路，允许用户监控温度和电压以确保安全操作，”Philofsky说。 “具有设备的可编程性，使我们能够进一步扩展此测量并允许在许多固定功能设备上更全面的可靠性视图。”</p><p> At the least, it means that margins can be squeezed. “The trend the industry was taking, before actually focusing on having good aging models and implementing an aging simulation flow, was to insert a lot of margin,” says Ramadan. “They were leaving a lot on the table, which they cannot afford any more. By doing some aging simulation, they are able to tighten the margins to compete in the market without taking on too much risk. They will leave some, but not as much as they did before.”</p><p> 至少，这意味着可以挤压边缘。 “在实际关注拥有良好的老龄化模型和实现老化模拟流程之前，行业正在服用的趋势是插入大量保证金，”斋月说。 “他们在桌子上留下了很多，他们无法承受更多。通过做一些老化模拟，他们能够收紧利润率，在市场上竞争，而不会冒着过多的风险。他们会留下一些，但不像以前一样。“</p><p> There remains hope within the CMC. “Back in 2018, the CMC released a standard that supports an aging simulation flow through the Open Modeling Interface (OMI),” he says. “There is more development to include additional models in that flow. It has gained a lot of adoption from different design houses, and most importantly from different foundries. This interface is simulator agnostic, meaning that foundries do not need to create a different interface for different simulators. We have seen a lot of pressure from design houses and foundries to provide an aging interface. And more and more foundries are currently starting to adopt the standard and OMI interface.”</p><p> 在CMC中仍有希望。 “回到2018年，CMC发布了一种支持通过开放建模界面（OMI）的老化模拟流量的标准，”他说。 “有更多的发展来包括该流程中的其他模型。它从不同的设计房屋中获得了很多采用，最重要的是来自不同的铸造。此界面是模拟器不可知论者，这意味着代工厂无需为不同的模拟器创建一个不同的接口。我们从设计房屋和铸造厂获得了大量压力，以提供老化界面。越来越多的铸造目前正在开始采用标准和omi界面。“</p><p> Conclusion While the mechanisms that contribute to aging are understood, the industry continues to struggle with the creation of models that provide sufficient accuracy. Part of the problem is there has not been enough time to collect data that can be used to assess those models and to fine tune them. That process is ongoing. Until the accuracy of those models is fully understood, design teams either have to leave some margin on the table, or they have to incorporate adaptive schemes into their devices to be able to mitigate any aging problems when they arise.</p><p> 结论虽然有助于老化的机制，但该行业继续与创建提供足够精度的模型斗争。部分问题是没有足够的时间来收集可用于评估这些模型并微调它们的数据。那个过程正在进行中。直到这些模型的准确性得到完全理解，设计团队要么必须在桌面上留下一些余量，或者他们必须将自适应方案纳入其设备，以便能够在出现时减轻任何老化问题。</p><p>          Hi Brian – Great article!
