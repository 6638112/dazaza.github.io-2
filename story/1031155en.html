He was chasing a hunch, and sure enough, initial sonar scans pinged back a pattern of dots that popped up on the map like a trail of breadcrumbs.</p><p>这位加州大学圣巴巴拉分校的科学家本应在那天研究甲烷渗漏，但由于借出了一个深海机器人，还有几个小时的空闲时间，现在是证实这一过去其他人无法证实的环境滥用的机会。他在追逐一种预感，果不其然，最初的声纳扫描就像一条面包屑的痕迹一样，在地图上弹出了一个圆点图案。</p><p> The robot made its way 3,000 feet down to the bottom, beaming bright lights and a camera as it slowly skimmed the seafloor. At this depth and darkness, the uncharted topography felt as eerie as driving through a vast desert at night.</p><p>机器人向下3000英尺深，缓慢掠过海底，发出明亮的灯光和摄像头。在这样的深度和黑暗中，未知的地形感觉就像在夜间驾车穿过广阔的沙漠一样诡异。</p><p>  “Holy crap. This is real,” Valentine said. “This stuff really is down there.</p><p>“我的天啊。这是真的，“瓦伦丁说。“这些东西真的在下面。</p><p>  Tales of this buried secret bubbling under the sea had haunted Valentine for years: a largely unknown chapter in the most infamous case of environmental destruction off the coast of Los Angeles — one lasting decades, costing tens of millions of dollars, frustrating generations of scientists. The fouling of the ocean was so reckless, some said, it seemed unimaginable.</p><p>这个被埋藏的秘密在海底冒泡的故事多年来一直困扰着瓦伦丁：这是洛杉矶海岸最臭名昭著的环境破坏案件中基本上不为人知的一章-这起案件持续了几十年，耗资数千万美元，让一代又一代科学家感到沮丧。一些人说，海洋的污染是如此鲁莽，似乎是不可想象的。</p><p> As many as half a million of these barrels could still be underwater right now, according to interviews and a Times review of historical records, manifests and undigitized research. From 1947 to 1982, the nation’s largest manufacturer of DDT — a pesticide so powerful that it poisoned birds and fish — was based in Los Angeles.</p><p>根据采访和时报对历史记录、清单和未数字化研究的审查，目前可能仍有多达50万桶这样的桶在水下。从1947年到1982年，美国最大的DDT制造商位于洛杉矶。DDT是一种强大的杀虫剂，可以毒死鸟类和鱼类。</p><p>  An  epic Superfund battle later exposed the company’s disposal of toxic waste through sewage pipes that poured into the ocean — but all the DDT that was barged out to sea drew comparatively little attention.</p><p>后来，一场史诗般的超级基金之争暴露了该公司通过排入海洋的排污管道处置有毒废物的行为-但所有被驳船运往大海的DDT都相对较少受到关注。</p><p> Shipping logs show that every month in the years after World War II, thousands of barrels of acid sludge laced with this synthetic chemical were boated out to a site near Catalina and dumped into the deep ocean — so vast that, according to common wisdom at the time, it would dilute even the most dangerous poisons.</p><p>航运日志显示，在二战结束后的几年里，每个月都会有数千桶含有这种合成化学品的酸性污泥被用船运到卡特琳娜附近的一个地点，然后倾倒到深海中--按照当时的普遍看法，这种污泥如此巨大，即使是最危险的毒药也可以稀释。</p><p> Regulators reported in the 1980s that the men in charge of getting rid of the DDT waste sometimes took shortcuts and just dumped it closer to shore. And when the barrels were too buoyant to sink on their own, one report said, the crews simply punctured them.</p><p>监管机构在20世纪80年代报告说，负责处理DDT废物的人有时会走捷径，只是把它倾倒在离海岸更近的地方。一份报告称，当桶太浮力而不能自己下沉时，工作人员只是简单地刺穿了它们。</p><p> The ocean buried the evidence for generations, but modern technology can take scientists to new depths. In 2011 and 2013, Valentine and his research team were able to identify about 60 barrels and collect a few samples during brief forays at the end of other research missions.</p><p>海洋将证据掩埋了几代人，但现代技术可以将科学家带到新的深度。2011年和2013年，瓦伦丁和他的研究团队在其他研究任务结束时的短暂突袭中，能够识别出约60桶石油，并收集了一些样本。</p><p> One sediment sample showed DDT concentrations 40 times greater than the highest contamination recorded at  the Superfund site — a federally designated area of hazardous waste that officials had contained to shallower waters near Palos Verdes.</p><p>一份沉积物样本显示，DDT的浓度是超级基金遗址记录的最高污染水平的40倍。超级基金遗址是联邦政府指定的危险废物区域，官员们将其控制在帕洛斯韦尔德斯附近的浅水水域。</p><p>  The world today wrestles with  microplastics, bisphenol A (BPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances  (PFAS) and other toxics so unnatural they don’t seem to ever go away. But DDT — the all-but-indestructible compound dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, which first stunned and jolted the public into environmental action — persists as an unsolved and largely forgotten problem.</p><p>今天的世界正在与微塑料、双酚A(BPA)、全氟烷基物质(PFAS)和多氟烷基物质(PFAS)搏斗，以及其他非天然的有毒物质，似乎从未消失过。但是DDT-一种几乎坚不可摧的化合物二氯二苯基三氯乙烷，最初让公众震惊并投入到环境行动中-仍然是一个未解决的、基本上被遗忘的问题。</p><p> Signs warning of tainted fish to this day still cover local piers. Recent  studies show our immune systems may be compromised. A new generation of women — exposed to DDT from their mothers, who were  exposed by their mothers — grapples with the still-mysterious  risks of breast cancer.</p><p>直到今天，警告污染鱼的标志仍然覆盖着当地的码头。最近的研究表明，我们的免疫系统可能会受到损害。新一代的女性-从她们的母亲那里接触到DDT，她们的母亲也接触到了DDT-正在与仍然神秘的乳腺癌风险作斗争。</p><p> The contamination in sea lions and dolphins continues to stump scientists, and the near extinction of falcons and bald eagles shows how poisoning one corner of the world can ripple across the whole ecosystem.</p><p>海狮和海豚的污染继续困扰着科学家，猎鹰和白头鹰的濒临灭绝表明，毒害世界的一个角落可以波及整个生态系统。</p><p> Decades of bureaucracy and competing environmental issues have diverted the public’s attention. Valentine hoped digging up physical evidence from the seafloor would get more people to care, but calls and emails to numerous officials since his discovery have gone nowhere.</p><p>几十年的官僚作风和相互竞争的环境问题转移了公众的注意力。瓦伦丁希望从海底挖掘物证能引起更多人的关注，但自从他被发现以来，给许多官员的电话和电子邮件都无济于事。</p><p> Rallying for the deep ocean is not easy, Valentine acknowledged, even though we rely on the health of these waters far more than we know: “The fact that there could be half a million barrels down there … we owe it to ourselves to figure out what happened, what’s actually down there and how much it’s all spreading.”</p><p>瓦伦丁承认，为了深海团结起来并不容易，尽管我们对这些水域的健康的依赖远远超出了我们所知道的：“事实是，那里可能有50万桶石油…。我们有责任弄清楚到底发生了什么，到底发生了什么，有多少正在蔓延。“</p><p>  Once hailed as a major scientific achievement, DDT combated both malaria and typhus during World War II. It was so potent that a single application could protect a soldier for months. The U.S. Army’s chief of preventive medicine, Brig. Gen. James Simmons, famously praised the chemical as “the war’s greatest contribution to the future health of the world.”</p><p>DDT一度被誉为一项重大的科学成就，在第二次世界大战期间，它同时对抗疟疾和斑疹伤寒。它的效力如此之大，以至于一次应用就可以保护一名士兵数月之久。美国陆军预防医学总司令詹姆斯·西蒙斯准将(Brig.Gen.James Simmons)曾著名地称赞这种化学物质是“战争对世界未来健康的最大贡献”。</p><p> Manufacturers rushed to supply the postwar demand — including Montrose Chemical Corp. of California, which opened its plant near Torrance in 1947. The chemical industry was celebrated at the time for boosting the nation into greater prosperity and preventing crop failures across the globe. The United States used as much as 80 million pounds of DDT in one year.</p><p>制造商争相供应战后的需求-包括加利福尼亚州的蒙特罗斯化学公司(Montrose Chemical Corp.)，该公司于1947年在托兰斯附近开设了工厂。当时，化学工业因推动国家走向更大繁荣和防止全球农作物歉收而受到赞誉。美国在一年内使用了多达8000万磅的DDT。</p><p>  But there were two edges to this sword. A top U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist had urged the military not to allow DDT insecticides for commercial use without further research, worried about “the effect they may have on soils and on the whole balance of nature.”</p><p>但这把剑有两面刃。美国农业部的一位顶尖科学家曾敦促军方，在没有进一步研究的情况下，不要允许DDT杀虫剂用于商业用途，担心“它们可能对土壤和整个自然平衡造成的影响”。</p><p> Even Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Müller, who won a Nobel Prize in 1948 for discovering DDT as a pesticide, cautioned that he himself did not fully understand how the chemical interacted with the living world. Decades of painstaking study still lay ahead for biologists, he said.</p><p>就连1948年因发现DDT作为杀虫剂而获得诺贝尔奖的瑞士化学家保罗·赫尔曼·穆勒(Paul Hermann Müller)也警告说，他自己并没有完全理解这种化学物质是如何与生物世界相互作用的。他说，生物学家仍将面临数十年的艰苦研究。</p><p> Rachel Carson, a marine biologist, heeded these words in 1962 and ignited a movement against what she called “the reckless and irresponsible poisoning of the world that man shares with all other creatures.”</p><p>1962年，海洋生物学家雷切尔·卡森(Rachel Carson)注意到了这些话，并发起了一场运动，反对她所说的“人类与所有其他生物共享的鲁莽和不负责任的毒害世界”。</p><p> Her revolutionary book “Silent Spring” evoked the sudden silence of songbirds missing in the skies — alerting unknowing people to the dangers of long-term exposure, even in tiny doses, to a chemical that they could not physically avoid.</p><p>她的革命性著作“寂静的春天”(Silent Spring)唤起了天空中失踪的鸣鸟的突然沉默-提醒不知情的人长期接触一种他们物理上无法避免的化学物质的危险，即使是很小的剂量。</p><p> DDT is so stable it can take generations to break down. It doesn’t really dissolve in water but stores easily in fat. Compounding these problems is what scientists today call “biomagnification”: the toxin accumulating in the tissues of animals in greater and greater concentrations as it moves up the food chain.</p><p>DDT非常稳定，可能需要几代人才能分解。它并不真的溶于水，但很容易储存在脂肪中。使这些问题雪上加霜的是今天科学家们所说的“生物放大作用”：毒素在食物链上游移动时，在动物组织中积累的浓度越来越高。</p><p> Consider phytoplankton, the microscopic algae that are the base for almost all food webs in the ocean.</p><p>以浮游植物为例，这种微小的藻类是海洋中几乎所有食物网的基础。</p><p> In 1969, shipments of jack mackerel from Southern California were recalled because DDT levels were as high as 10 parts per million, or ppm — double what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered safe for consumption at that time.</p><p>1969年，从南加州发货的Jack Mackerel被召回，因为DDT水平高达百万分之10，即百万分之10-是当时美国食品和药物管理局(U.S.Food and Drug Administration)认为可以安全消费的两倍。</p><p> In that same year, California brown pelicans, which eat the fish, laid eggs on Anacapa Island with chemicals broken down from DDT averaging 1,200 ppm.</p><p>同年，吃这种鱼的加州褐鹈鹕在Anacapa岛产卵，其化学物质从DDT中分解出来，平均含量为1200ppm。</p><p> Scientists discovered that the chemicals led to eggshells so thin that the chicks would die. Bald eagles had also vanished from the Channel Islands, along with peregrine falcons and the brown pelicans.</p><p>科学家发现，这些化学物质会导致蛋壳变薄，导致雏鸟死亡。白头鹰以及游隼和褐鹈鹕也从海峡群岛消失了。</p><p> Similarly, sea lions with more than 1,000 ppm in their blubber were giving birth to pups prematurely. Bottlenose dolphins had concentrations as high as 2,000 ppm.</p><p>同样，脂肪含量超过1000ppm的海狮也会早产幼崽。宽吻海豚的浓度高达百万分之两千。</p><p> Montrose executives aggressively defended DDT through the 1960s as the public reckoned with these alarming new concerns about food chains and poisoned ecosystems.</p><p>Montrose的高管在20世纪60年代一直在积极为DDT辩护，因为公众正在考虑这些令人震惊的对食物链和有毒生态系统的新担忧。</p><p> They said in letters and editorials that DDT played a vital role in society when properly used and was not a serious threat to human health. They accused environmentalists of scare tactics and misleading information and touted the company’s reputation of making the best DDT in the world — a technical grade sold to other firms that would then dilute it into specific insecticides.</p><p>他们在信件和社论中表示，如果使用得当，DDT在社会中发挥着至关重要的作用，并不会对人类健康构成严重威胁。他们指责环保主义者的恐吓策略和误导性信息，并吹捧该公司生产世界上最好的滴滴涕的声誉-这是一种出售给其他公司的技术等级，然后将其稀释成特定的杀虫剂。</p><p> The company was supplying governments from Brazil to India, they said, and even the World Health Organization. International malaria eradication programs turned to Montrose for supplies.</p><p>他们说，该公司向从巴西到印度的各国政府供应产品，甚至向世界卫生组织(World Health Organization)供应产品。国际根除疟疾计划转向蒙特罗斯寻求供应。</p><p> But after years of intense inquiries, government officials  said they were convinced that the chemical posed unacceptable risks to the environment and potential harm to human health. In 1972, the U.S. finally  banned the use of DDT.</p><p>但经过多年的紧张调查，政府官员表示，他们确信这种化学物质对环境构成了不可接受的风险，并对人类健康构成了潜在危害。1972年，美国终于禁止使用滴滴涕。</p><p> Demand was still strong in other countries, however, so the chemical plant in Los Angeles kept churning out more. Montrose managed to operate for another 10 years before the factory, looming over Normandie Avenue near Del Amo Boulevard, finally went dark.</p><p>然而，其他国家的需求仍然强劲，因此洛杉矶的化工厂继续大量生产。Montrose设法又运营了10年，直到工厂隐约出现在德尔阿莫大道附近的诺曼底大道上，终于熄灭了。</p><p>  In the early 1980s, a young scientist at the California Regional Water Quality Control Board in Los Angeles heard whispers that Montrose once dumped barrels of toxic waste directly into the ocean. People at the time were hyper-focused on the contamination problems posed by poorly treated sewage, but Allan Chartrand was curious about the deep-sea dumping and started poking around.</p><p>20世纪80年代初，洛杉矶加州地区水质控制委员会的一名年轻科学家听到传言称，Montrose曾将一桶桶有毒废物直接倾倒到海洋中。当时，人们高度关注处理不当的污水带来的污染问题，但艾伦·查特兰(Allan Chartrand)对深海倾倒感到好奇，开始四处打听。</p><p> He called Montrose, and to his surprise, the staff pulled out all their files. He and a team of regulatory scientists combed through volumes of shipping logs, which showed that more than 2,000 barrels of DDT-laced sludge were dumped each month. They did the math: Between 1947 and 1961, as much as 767 tons of DDT could have gone into the ocean.</p><p>他打电话给蒙特罗斯，令他惊讶的是，工作人员拿出了他们所有的文件。他和一组监管科学家梳理了大量的运输日志，这些日志显示，每个月都有超过2000桶含有DDT的污泥被倾倒。他们做了计算：在1947年至1961年间，可能有多达767吨DDT流入海洋。</p><p> “We found actual photos of the workers at 2 in the morning dumping — not only dumping barrels off of the barges in the middle of the Santa Monica Basin,” he said, “but before they would dump the barrels, they would take a big ax or hatchet to them, and cut them open on purpose so they would sink.”</p><p>“我们发现了工人们凌晨2点倾倒石油的真实照片--不仅是在圣莫尼卡盆地中央的驳船上倾倒桶，”他说，“而且在他们倾倒桶之前，他们会拿起一把大斧头或斧头对着它们，故意把它们切开，这样它们就会沉没。”</p><p>  On a recent morning, Chartrand rummaged through stacks of yellowing papers and reports detailing everything he had discovered so many decades ago. Now a seasoned eco-toxicologist in Seattle, he never understood why all this information wound up gathering dust — undigitized and largely forgotten.</p><p>最近的一天早上，查特朗翻阅着一堆堆泛黄的文件和报告，详细描述了他几十年前发现的一切。现在，他是西雅图一名经验丰富的生态毒理学家，他从来不明白为什么所有这些信息最终都会尘埃落定--没有数字化，而且基本上被遗忘了。</p><p> He pulled out faded reports that his team had published from 1985 to 1989, summarizing what they had found at Montrose and in the water quality control board’s own records. “This makes my heart sing,” he said, as he reread conclusions that still resonate today.</p><p>他拿出了他的团队从1985年到1989年发表的褪色报告，总结了他们在蒙特罗斯和水质控制委员会自己的记录中发现的东西。“这让我的心在歌唱，”他一边说，一边重读至今仍有共鸣的结论。</p><p>  Chartrand said he was astonished to learn this kind of activity was allowed. Federal ocean dumping laws dated back to 1886, but the rules were focused on clearing the way for ship navigation. It wasn’t until the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, also known as the Ocean Dumping Act, that environmental impacts were considered.</p><p>Chartrand说，得知这种活动被允许，他感到惊讶。联邦海洋倾倒法可以追溯到1886年，但这些规定的重点是为船只航行扫清道路。直到1972年的海洋保护、研究和庇护所法案，也就是众所周知的海洋倾倒法案，才考虑到对环境的影响。</p><p>  Landfills could hold only so much, and people were concerned about burning toxics into the air — but the Pacific Ocean seemed a good alternative. Explosives, oil refinery waste, trash and rotting meats all went into the ocean, along with beryllium, various acid sludges, even cyanide.</p><p>垃圾填埋场只能容纳这么多，人们担心将有毒物质燃烧到空气中-但太平洋似乎是一个很好的选择。炸药、炼油厂废物、垃圾和腐烂的肉类都和铍、各种酸泥，甚至氰化物一起进入海洋。</p><p> Dilution is the solution to pollution, the saying used to go, but at what cost? The ocean covers more than 70% of the planet, but it can absorb only so much. What we eat, what we breathe is ultimately dictated by what we do to the sea.</p><p>稀释是解决污染的办法，这句话过去常说，但代价是什么呢？海洋覆盖了地球70%以上的面积，但它只能吸收这么多。我们吃什么，呼吸什么，最终取决于我们对海洋的所作所为。</p><p> “It’s just sad, sad, sad,” Chartrand said. “When stuff’s being dumped offshore like that, it’s in the dead of night, nobody’s seeing it. It’s out of sight, out of mind.”</p><p>“这太令人难过了，”查特兰说。“当东西像那样被倾倒在海上时，那是在深夜，没有人看到它。这是看不见、想不到的。“。</p><p> For years, a company called California Salvage docked at the Port of Los Angeles, loaded up Montrose’s DDT waste and hauled everything out to sea. Workers were instructed to dump in a designated spot, dubbed Dumpsite No. 1, that was about 10 nautical miles northwest of Catalina.</p><p>多年来，一家名为加州打捞公司的公司停靠在洛杉矶港，装载蒙特罗斯的DDT废物，并将所有东西拖到海上。工人们被指示在卡塔利纳西北约10海里处的一个指定地点倾倒垃圾，名为1号垃圾场。</p><p> Each container was individually broken before disposal overboard. Drums containing chemicals were emptied and allowed to sink after holes were placed in the top, bottom and sides.</p><p>每个集装箱在出海前都是单独破碎的。在顶部、底部和侧面打孔后，倒空装有化学品的桶，让其下沉。</p><p> But compliance inspections were infrequent, and crews sometimes took shortcuts. Chartrand discovered notes from California Salvage indicating they had decided to dump elsewhere because Dumpsite No. 1 was in line of a naval weapons firing range.</p><p>但合规检查并不频繁，工作人员有时会走捷径。查特兰发现了加州打捞公司的纸条，表明他们决定在其他地方倾倒垃圾，因为1号垃圾场在海军武器射击场的直线上。</p><p>  “Our report caught them red-handed,” Chartrand said. “Here I was this young guy — newly married, just had my first kid, got my new job at the water quality control board — heard about this dumping, went down to Montrose … and it very quickly got so much bigger than me.”</p><p>“我们的报告当场抓住了他们，”查特兰说。“我是这样一个年轻人--新婚不久，刚有了第一个孩子，得到了水质控制委员会的新工作--听说了这起倾倒事件，就去了蒙特罗斯大学(montrose…)。它很快就变得比我大得多。“。</p><p> In 1990, a few years after Chartrand compiled his reports, the Environmental Protection Agency teamed up with the state and launched a court battle against Montrose and a number of other companies under the Superfund law. Environmental groups expected the lawsuit — the largest in U.S. history alleging natural resource damages from chemical dumping — to be a landmark case in resolving coastal pollution issues.</p><p>1990年，在Chartrand汇编他的报告几年后，美国环境保护局(Environmental Protection Agency)与该州联手，根据超级基金法对Montrose和其他一些公司发起了一场法庭诉讼。环保组织预计，这起诉讼-美国历史上最大的指控化学品倾倒对自然资源造成损害的诉讼-将成为解决沿海污染问题的一个里程碑式的案件。</p><p> Chartrand and dozens of others were pulled in to testify. Science was disputed in court, evidence debated, expertise challenged. In numerous depositions, former factory workers were grilled on how they operated.</p><p>查特兰和其他几十人被拉去作证。科学在法庭上受到争议，证据受到辩论，专业知识受到质疑。在许多证词中，前工厂工人被盘问他们是如何运作的。</p><p> Bernard Bratter, a Montrose plant superintendent, described how they would call California Salvage to dump its acid waste in bulk: “The trucks would come in, we’d load the trucks, they would then haul them down to the harbor where they had their barges, and the truck would unload into the barge, and when there was enough liquid in the barge, they’d haul the barge out to the specified area in the ocean and release the acid.”</p><p>蒙特罗斯工厂主管伯纳德·布拉特(Bernard Bratter)描述了他们会如何打电话给加州打捞公司，让他们把大量酸性废物倾倒出来：“卡车会进来，我们会装载卡车，然后他们会把卡车拖到他们有驳船的港口，卡车会把它们卸到驳船上，当驳船里有足够的液体时，他们会把驳船拖到海洋中的特定区域，然后释放酸。”</p><p>  Montrose officials, who had filed counterclaims, asked the court to exclude the evidence presented on ocean dumping — arguing that such dumping wasn’t relevant.</p><p>已经提起反诉的蒙特罗斯官员要求法院排除关于海洋倾倒的证据-辩称这种倾倒是无关紧要的。</p><p> They said the government’s natural resources damage claim was based solely on the release of DDT through the sewer system to the Palos Verdes shelf, and that attorneys could not prove that Montrose’s disposal of DDT-contaminated waste into the deep ocean actually hurt various bird species.</p><p>他们说，政府的自然资源损害索赔完全基于通过下水道系统向帕洛斯韦尔德斯大陆架释放DDT，律师无法证明Montrose将DDT污染的废物处置到深海中确实伤害了各种鸟类。</p><p> They also questioned Chartrand’s calculations of how much DDT went into the ocean and made the point that there was nothing secret or illegal about the dumping at the time. The government, they said, allowed this to happen.</p><p>他们还质疑Chartrand对有多少DDT进入海洋的计算，并指出当时的倾倒没有任何秘密或非法之处。他们说，政府允许这种情况发生。</p><p> In  an interoffice correspondence in 1985, Samuel Rotrosen, Montrose’s president at the time, wrote that “it is true that from 1947, when the plant started up, until sometime in the 1950s we disposed of our waste sulfuric acid at sea through California Salvage Company who barged it out to state-approved dumping areas.</p><p>Montrose当时的总裁塞缪尔·罗特森(Samuel Rotrosen)在1985年的一次办公室间通信中写道：“确实，从1947年工厂启动以来，直到20世纪50年代的某个时候，我们通过加州打捞公司将废硫酸运到州政府批准的倾倒区。</p><p> “We stopped this disposal after we installed our acid-recovery plant, at which time we sold the acid to fertilizer makers,” he said. “Because our acid contained traces of DDT (50-250 ppm) … the fertilizer producers would no longer take it, and so we disposed of it at landfills.”</p><p>“在我们安装了酸回收装置后，我们停止了这种处置，当时我们把酸卖给了化肥制造商，”他说。“因为我们的酸中含有微量的滴滴涕(50-250ppm)…。化肥生产商不再收了，所以我们把它丢弃在垃圾填埋场。“。</p><p>  As the court battle waged on, a handful of curious scientists kept trying to solve the DDT questions at the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>随着法庭之争的进行，少数好奇的科学家不断试图解决海底的滴滴涕问题。</p><p> Chartrand did not have a deep-sea robot, but he figured out a way to collect sediment samples and clumps of tar by dragging a large otter trawl net along the seafloor. He also took samples of rattails, kelp bass and other fish from different depths of the ocean.</p><p>查特兰没有深海机器人，但他想出了一种方法，通过沿着海底拖动一个大型水獭拖网来收集沉积物样本和焦油块。他还从不同的海洋深处采集了鼠尾、海带鲈鱼和其他鱼类的样本。</p><p> He called Robert Risebrough, a legend among DDT scientists whose testimonies in the 1960s and early 1970s helped Congress understand why the chemical should be banned. Risebrough, a UC Santa Cruz research ecologist at the time, ran the samples and authored a sweeping study. He confirmed the existence of considerable concentrations of DDT chemicals in both the sediments and the “tar cakes” by the dumpsites.</p><p>他称罗伯特·里塞布罗(Robert Risebough)为DDT科学家中的传奇人物，他在20世纪60年代和70年代初的证词帮助国会理解了为什么应该禁止这种化学品。Risebough当时是加州大学圣克鲁斯分校的研究生态学家，他运行了样本，并撰写了一项全面的研究。他证实，在垃圾场的沉积物和“焦油蛋糕”中都存在相当浓度的滴滴涕化学物质。</p><p> It was unclear how much the DDT could move through the water at such depths, where there is little oxygen, he said, but the dumping was close enough to the Channel Islands that the upwelling of deeper water common in this area could stir up what enters the food chain.</p><p>他说，目前尚不清楚DDT能在这么深的水中移动多少，因为那里几乎没有氧气，但倾倒的地点离海峡群岛足够近，以至于该地区常见的深水上涌可能会搅动进入食物链的东西。</p><p> And if the barrels were indeed punctured, he added, some of the sludge could have leaked out on its way down to the seafloor.</p><p>他补充说，如果桶真的被刺破了，一些污泥可能会在下沉到海底的途中泄漏出来。</p><p> He had a strong suspicion that the disappearance of bald eagles from Catalina was connected to the dumping operations, but he didn’t have the data to confirm it. DDT contamination was also significantly higher in birds that fed on fish, compared with birds that ate mostly rodents and prey on land — another clue that the DDT from the ocean dumping was harming wildlife.</p><p>他强烈怀疑，卡特琳娜的秃鹰失踪事件与倾倒作业有关，但他没有数据来证实这一点。与主要以啮齿动物和猎物为食的陆地鸟类相比，以鱼为食的鸟类的DDT污染也要高得多-这是海洋倾倒产生的DDT正在损害野生动物的另一个线索。</p><p> He called for more studies to connect the dots, but Chartrand had run out of funding. Chartrand held on to what he could — even the remaining samples that neither he nor Risebrough could bear to throw away. Some of that deep sea sediment has yet to be tested.</p><p>他呼吁进行更多的研究来连接这些点，但Chartrand已经用完了资金。Chartrand保留了他能保留的东西-即使是他和Risebough都不忍心扔掉的剩余样本。其中一些深海沉积物还有待测试。</p><p> “They’re in a deep freeze now, but because it’s DDT, even though it’s been 30, 40 years, they’re still valid,” Chartrand said. “If we could get the funding, those are still worth running.”</p><p>Chartrand说：“它们现在处于深度冰冻状态，但因为它是滴滴涕，即使已经30、40年了，它们仍然有效。”“如果我们能拿到资金，这些项目仍然值得运营。”</p><p> “They were supposed to take it out to sea. I think beyond the Continental Shelf. But there was a common joke among people that they only took it as far as they needed to, just out of sight, and started dumping right there.”</p><p>“他们应该把它带到海上去。我认为在大陆架之外。但在人们中间有一个普遍的笑话，他们只把它带到他们需要的地方，就在看不见的地方，就在那里开始倾倒。“。</p><p> M. Indira Venkatesan, a geochemist at UCLA who studied how chemicals moved through the sea, had taken one of these samples in the early 1990s and run her own analyses. She, too, concluded there must be a DDT source in the ocean much larger than just what had come out of the sewage closer to shore.</p><p>加州大学洛杉矶分校(UCLA)的地球化学家M·英迪拉·文卡特桑(M.Indira Venkatesan)研究了化学物质是如何在海洋中移动的，她在20世纪90年代初提取了其中一个样本，并进行了自己的分析。她也得出结论，海洋中肯定有一个滴滴涕源，比更靠近海岸的污水中排出的滴滴涕源大得多。</p><p> She collected additional sediment cores from the seafloor by a manual pulley that her technicians and graduate students spent hours pulling up. Her team distinguished the DDT “fingerprint” for Montrose’s ocean-dumped waste and discussed the upward and downward diffusion of DDT in the sediments.</p><p>她用手动滑轮从海底收集了额外的沉积物岩芯，她的技术人员和研究生花了几个小时才把这些滑轮拉上来。她的团队区分了蒙特罗斯倾倒在海洋中的废物的滴滴涕“指纹”，并讨论了滴滴涕在沉积物中的向上和向下扩散。</p><p> “It gets resuspended and remobilized. That’s why you see it all over the basin,” she said. “I knew, I just knew, this DDT source was significant, just from the chemical analysis, but we couldn’t show the extent of the dumping, nor the number of barrels.”</p><p>“它被重新挂起和重新动员。这就是为什么你在整个盆地上都能看到它，“她说。“我知道，我就知道，这个滴滴涕来源很重要，仅从化学分析就知道了，但我们无法显示倾倒的程度，也不能显示桶的数量。”</p><p> Back in court, the arguments were focusing on the more tangible: the hundreds of tons of DDT and PCBs, another toxic chemical, that had been released two miles off the coast of Palos Verdes where the sewage emptied into the ocean. Many saw the need to make this public health problem — much closer to shore, with visible harm to humans and the ecosystem — a top priority.</p><p>回到法庭上，争论的焦点是更切实的：数百吨DDT和另一种有毒化学物质多氯联苯(PCBs)，它们被释放到距离帕洛斯韦尔德斯海岸两英里的地方，污水就是在那里排入海洋的。许多人认为有必要将这个公共卫生问题作为头等大事-离海岸更近，对人类和生态系统有明显的伤害。</p><p> The site — spread across more than 17 square miles — was  declared a Superfund cleanup in 1996. About 200 feet deep, it was considered one of the most complicated hazard sites in the United States — at least three times deeper than similar Superfund sites in Boston and New York harbors.</p><p>这个占地超过17平方英里的地点在1996年被宣布为超级基金清理。大约200英尺深，它被认为是美国最复杂的危险地点之一-至少是波士顿和纽约港类似超级基金地点的三倍深。</p><p>  By late 2000, the parties decided to settle. They  negotiated a consent decree midway through trial — no sides admitting fault, with  an agreement that more than $140 million would be paid by Montrose, several other companies that owned or operated a share of the plant, and local governments led by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts.</p><p>到2000年底，双方决定和解。审判进行到一半时，他们通过谈判达成了一项同意法令-双方都不承认错误，协议由Montrose、其他几家拥有或运营该工厂股份的公司，以及以洛杉矶县卫生区为首的地方政府支付超过1.4亿美元。</p><p> The settlement — one of the largest in the nation for an environmental damage claim — would pay for cleanup, habitat restoration and education programs for people at risk of eating contaminated fish.</p><p>这项和解协议是美国最大的环境损害索赔协议之一，将支付清理、栖息地恢复和教育项目的费用，供有食用受污染鱼类风险的人使用。</p><p> “This Decree was negotiated ... in good faith at arm’s length to avoid the continuation of expensive and protracted litigation and is a fair and equitable settlement of claims which were vigorously contested,” according to  the decree, which mentioned that the damage claim includes “any ocean dumpsites used for disposing of wastes from the Montrose Plant Property.”</p><p>“这项法令是谈判达成的.。该法令指出，损害索赔包括“任何用于处置蒙特罗斯工厂的废物的海洋倾倒场”。该法令说，损害索赔包括“任何用于处置蒙特罗斯工厂的废物的海洋倾倒场”，以避免昂贵和旷日持久的诉讼继续进行，并且是对激烈争辩的索赔的公正和公平的解决办法“，该法令指出，损害索赔包括”任何用于处置蒙特罗斯工厂的废物的海洋倾倒场“。</p><p>  Attorneys representing Montrose, when contacted by The Times, declined to comment on the new underwater data and noted that the ocean claims related to the DDT operation were resolved 20 years ago. Litigation continues to this day over other impacts from the former plant. In August, a  $56.6-million settlement was finally reached over groundwater contamination.</p><p>当时报联系到Montrose的代理律师时，他们拒绝对新的水下数据发表评论，并指出与DDT行动相关的海洋索赔在20年前就已经解决了。关于前工厂的其他影响的诉讼至今仍在继续。8月，最终就地下水污染达成5660万美元的和解协议。</p><p> Back at UCLA, on a recent morning in the geology building, Venkatesan thought ruefully back to those DDT years. KCBS had run a local news series on the barrels, and The Times  followed the story for a brief period.</p><p>回到加州大学洛杉矶分校，最近的一个早晨，在地质学大楼里，文卡特桑悲伤地回想起那些滴滴涕岁月。KCBS已经播放了一系列关于桶的当地新闻，时报也对这个故事进行了短暂的跟踪。</p><p> The information caught the attention of Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the 1960s activist turned lawmaker who married Jane Fonda and was remembered as “the radical inside the system.” For a few years, he  pushed for more information about the barrels and an action plan, but so many unchecked </p><p>这一信息引起了国会议员汤姆·海登(D-Santa Monica)的注意，这位20世纪60年代的活动家出身的立法者嫁给了简·方达(Jane Fonda)，并以“体制内的激进分子”而被人们铭记。几年来，他一直在推动提供更多关于石油桶的信息和行动计划，但有太多的信息没有得到检查。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/">https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-coast-ddt-dumping-ground/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/滴滴涕/">#滴滴涕</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ddt/">#ddt</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
