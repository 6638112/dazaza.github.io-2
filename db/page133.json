All that matters is what other people see in it and what buyers are willing to pay.  The 2020\u2019s equivalent of Warhol paintings are  Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFTs). In this essay I\u2019ll explain what NFTs are by motivating them with some interesting real-world problems. Then I\u2019ll discuss why the NFT craze for digital art generates so much ideologically contentious debate. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss some parallels between artistic and financial nihilism, and how this might serve as a framework for thinking about wildly speculative markets.     Suppose you want to buy a Birkin bag or some other luxury brand item. An unauthorized seller \u2014 perhaps someone who needs some emergency cash \u2014 is willing to sell you a Birkin bag. They offer you a good discount, relative to the price the authorized retailer would charge you. But how can you be sure they aren\u2019t selling you a fake? Counterfeits for these items are very high quality, and the average Birkin customer probably can\u2019t tell the difference between a real and a fake.   One way to avoid counterfeits is to only purchase items from an authorized retailer, e.g. a trusted Herm\u00e8s store. But this is not practical because it prevents people from selling or giving away their bags. If you leave your bag to someone in your will, then its authenticity is no longer guaranteed.  So we have the market need: how does a seller pass on or sell a luxury item? How does a buyer ensure that they are buying an authentic item?  One possible answer is for Herm\u00e8s to print out a list of secret serial numbers, perhaps sewn inside the bag, that declare whether a bag is legit or not. Owners receive a serial number when they buy the bag. But this is not a strong deterrent. A counterfeiter could just buy a real bag and then copy its serial number into many fake bags.  What if Herm\u00e8s maintains a public website of who owns which bag? Any time a bag changes ownership, this ledger needs to be updated. By recording a unique owner for each unique serial number, this solves the problem of counterfeiters simply duplicating serial numbers. The process shifts from verifying properties to verifying transactions and owners.  These approaches would work, but has a centralized point of failure: If the Herm\u00e8s website goes down, nobody can trade bags anymore. Herm\u00e8s is a big company and has the resources to protect their website against DDOS attacks and other cybersecurity threat vectors, but smaller luxury brands might not have a state-of-the-art security department. If they are not careful, their security could be breached by hackers or an unscrupulous sysadmin. Also, if Herm\u00e8s stops operating as a company in 25 years, who will maintain the ledger of ownership? If it is a third party company, can we trust them not to abuse that power? Even in the unlikely event that the central point of failure never makes a mistake, it\u2019s still mildly annoying to require Herm\u00e8s to get involved every time a bag changes hands.   What if you could verify transactions and owners, without a centralized party? This is where Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, come in. In 2009, someone  published a landmark paper on how to build a decentralized ledger of who owns what. This ledger is called a &#34;blockchain&#34;. A blockchain is a record of the consensus state of the world, following some agreed-upon protocol that is known to everyone. The remarkable thing about blockchains is that they are decentralized (no central point of failure), and resilient to malicious actors in the network.-Distributed consensus is reached by each individual contributing some resource like money, hash rate, or computer storage. So long as a large fraction of resources in the network are controlled by well-behaved actors, the integrity of the blockchain remains secure. The fraction required typically varies from one-thirds to just over a half.   There are many blockchains out there. The details of how their consensus protocols are implemented are fascinating but beyond the scope of this essay. The important thing to know is that the base technology underlying NFTs and cryptocurrencies is a formal protocol that allows people to come to an agreement on who owns what without having to involve a trusted third party (e.g. Herm\u00e8s, an escrow agent, your bank, or your government). Theoretically speaking, blockchains allow shared consensus in a trustless society.  NFTs are like a paper deed of ownership, but instead of paper the certificate is digital. And unlike a paper deed an NFT cannot be forged. NFTs contain a unique \u201cserial number\u201d that is publicly viewable, but only one person can be said to \u201cpossess\u201d that serial number on the blockchain, much like how home addresses are public but registered to a single owner by the recording office. To see how NFTs solve the Birkin bag counterfeit problem, let\u2019s suppose Herm\u00e8s publicly declares the following for all to hear:   \u201cOwners of True Birkin bags will be issued a digital certificate of authenticity represented by an NFT\u201d  As a buyer, you can be quite confident that the bag is authentic if the seller also owns the NFT, and you can verify that the NFT was indeed originally created by Herm\u00e8s by looking up its public transaction history. During a transaction, the seller simply gives the buyer the bag and tells the blockchain to re-assign ownership of the NFT to the buyer\u2019s digital identifier. If the payment is done in cryptocurrency, the escrow can even be performed  using a smart contract without a centralized party (the seller publishes contract \u201cIf a specific buyer\u2019s wallet address sends me X USDC in 24 hours, send the NFT is sent to them and send the cash to me.\u201d)  NFTs provide the means to implement digital scarcity, but there still needs to be a way to pair it with a real-world item in the \u201canalog\u201d world. A seller could still bypass the security of NFTs by selling you an NFT with a fake Birkin bag. However, for every fake bag you want to sell, you need to purchase a real NFT and the real bag that comes with it. After you sell the NFT with the fake bag, you are left with a real bag with no NFT! Subsequently, the market value of the real bag drops because buyers will be highly suspicious of a seller who says &#34;this is a real bag, I don&#39;t have the NFT because I just sold it with a fake bag.&#34; While NFTs are not sure proof of a physical Birkin bag&#39;s authenticity, they all but ruin the economic incentives of counterfeiting.   What about luxury consumable goods? You could buy NFT-certified Wagyu beef, sell the NFT with some cheaper steak, and then eat the real Wagyu beef - it doesn\u2019t matter what other people think you&#39;re eating. However, NFT transactions are public, so a grocery shopper would be quite suspicious of a food NFT that has changed hands outside of the typical supply chain addresses. For NFTs paired with physical goods, each \u201cunusual\u201d transaction significantly adds to counterfeit risk, which diminishes the economic incentives to counterfeiters. This is especially true for consumable, perishable goods.  Authenticity is useful, even outside of Veblen goods. You can imagine using NFTs to implement anonymous digital identity verification ( a 30B market by 2024), or ship it with food products like meat where the customer cares a lot about the provenance of the product. In Taiwan, there is a current ongoing scandal where a bunch of US-imported pork has been passed off as \u201cdomestic pork\u201d and nobody can trust their butchers anymore.   In the most general case, NFTs can be used to implement provenance tracking of both physical and digital assets - an increasingly important need in our modern age of disinformation. Where did this photo of a politician come from? Who originally produced this audio clip?     NFTs make a lot of sense for protecting the authenticity of luxury goods or implementing single sign-on or tracking the provenance of meat products, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re primarily used for today. Rather, most people sell NFTs for digital art. Here are some early examples of art NFTs, called \u201cCryptopunks\u201d. Each punk is a 24x24 RGB image.  One of these recently sold for 17M USD in an auction. At first glance, this is perplexing. The underlying digital content - some pixels stored in a file - are freely accessible to anyone. Why would anyone pay so much for a certificate of authenticity on something that anyone can enjoy for free? Is the buyer the one that gets punked?\n It\u2019s easy to dismiss this behavior as poor taste colliding with the arbitrarily large disposable income of rich people, in particular crypto millionaires that swap crypto assets with other crypto millionaires. While this may be true, I think it\u2019s far more interesting to ask \u201cwhat worldview would cause a rational person to bet $17M on a certificate for a 24x24x3 set of pixel values\u201d?   Historically, the lion\u2019s share of rewards for digital content has been owned by distribution technology like Spotify or content aggregators like Facebook, and then split with the management company. The creatives themselves are paid pittances, and do not share in the financialization of their labor. The optimist case for NFT art is as follows: NFTs are decentralized, which means any artist with an internet connection can draw up financial contracts for their art on their own terms. If NFTs revolutionize the business model of digital art, and if the future of art is mostly digital, then the first art NFTs to ever be issued might accrue significant cultural relevance, and that\u2019s why they command such high speculative prices.   Valuing art based on cultural relevance might be a bit absurd, but why is the Mona Lisa \u201cThe Mona Lisa\u201d? da Vinci arguably made \u201cbetter\u201d paintings from a technical standpoint. It&#39;s because of intangible value. The Mona Lisa is valuable because of its cultural proximity to important events and people in history, and the mimetic desire of other humans. In fact, it was a relatively obscure painting until 1911, when it was stolen from the Louvre and became a source of national shame overnight.   All art, from your child\u2019s first finger painting, to an antique heirloom passed down generations, to a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d like the Mona Lisa, are valued this way. They are valuable simply because others deem it valuable.   NFTs are the digital equivalent of buying a  banana duck-taped to a wall; you are betting that in the future, that statement of ownership on some blockchain will be historically significant, which you can presumably trade in for cash or clout or both. But buyer beware: things get philosophically tricky when applying the theory of \u201cintangible value\u201d to digital information and artwork where the cost of replication goes to zero.   I can think of two ways to look at how one values NFTs for digital art. One perspective is that in a world full of fake Birkin bags and products sourced from ethically dubious places, the only thing of value is the certificate of authenticity. The cultural and mimetic value of content has transferred entirely to the provenance certificate, and not the pixels themselves (which can be copied for free). If art\u2019s value is derived from the cultural relevance it represents and its proximity to important people, then the most sensible way to make high art would not be to improve one\u2019s painting skills, but to schmooze with a lot of famous people and insert oneself into important events in history, and issue scarce status symbols for the bourgeoisie. Warhol did exactly that.\u00a0  The alternate view is that if a perfect copy can be made of some pixels, then it is not really a counterfeit at all, and therefore the NFT secures nothing of actual value. Is it meaningful to ascribe a certificate of authenticity to something that can be perfectly replicated? Is \u201cauthenticity\u201d of a stream of 0s and 1s meaningless? There is certainly utility in verifying the source of some information, but anyone can mint an NFT for the same information.  In summary, the Pro-NFT crowd values the intangible \u201ccollector\u2019s scarcity and cultural relevance\u201d. The anti-NFT focuses on tangible value - how much real value does this secure? Both are reasonable frameworks to value things, and you can end up with wildly different conclusions.\n  Convince enough people that a urinal is valuable, and it becomes an investment grade asset. This is no longer merely a matter of art philosophy - when you invest in an index fund, you are essentially reinforcing the market\u2019s current belief of valuations. When people bid up the price of TSLA or GME to stratospheric valuations, the index fund must re-adjust their market-weighted holdings to reflect those prices, creating further money inflows to the asset and thus a  self-fulfilling prophecy. As it turns out, the art-of-investing is much like investing-in-art. As I have suggested in the title of this essay and borrowed from Warhol (who probably borrowed it from Marshall McLuhan),\u00a0 stonks are what you can get away with.\n    We are starting to see this valuation framework being applied to the equities market today, where price movements are dominated by narratives about where the price is going and what other people are willing to pay for it, especially with meme stocks like GME and AMC. Many retail investors don\u2019t really care about whether GME\u2019s price is justified by their corporate earnings - they simply buy at any cost. This financial nihilism - where intrinsic value is unknowable and all that matters is what other people think - is a worldview often encountered in Gen Z retail traders and a surprising number of professional traders I know. Perhaps the  midwit meme is really true.  This is definitely a cause for some concern, but at the same time, I think value investors should keep an open mind that what first seems like irrational behavior might have a method to madness. If you have an irrational force acting in the markets, like shareholders who refuse to sell or lend their stock, a discounted cash flow model for AMC or GME starts to not become very predictive of share price. By reflexivity, that will have impacts on future cash flows! In a similar fashion, using present-day frameworks for thinking about business and value do not account for the disruptive force of technology. That\u2019s why I find NFTs so fascinating - they are an intersection of finance, art, technology, and the nihilistic framework of valuation that is so prevalent in our society today.\u00a0  What is rational behavior for an investor, anyway? Is it \u201cstandard behavior\u201d as measured against the population average? How do you tell apart standard behavior from a collective delusion? Perhaps the luxury bag makers,  Ryan Cohens, and Andy Warhol\u2019s of the world understand it best: Convince the world to believe in your values, and you will be the sanest person on the planet. For fifteen minutes, at least.

Seafood or intelligent marine life?\n A group of Conservative MPs think it&#39;s the latter and argue they should be included in a law to protect animals.\n The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill recognises animal sentience - which is the capacity of animals to have feelings, including pain and suffering.\n It currently says fish, and other vertebrates which feel pain, should be protected as much as possible.\n Animals like lobsters and octopus are not currently protected by the bill because as invertebrates, their body is different to ours, so they aren&#39;t thought to have those complex feelings, says a report by the  Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF).\n  The report says arguments against recognising these species focuses on physical differences between these animals and humans - but this fails to understand what it means for an animal to have feelings.\n   It says those species &#34;undoubtedly experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves,&#34; but what matters is whether they feel pleasure and pain.\n  &#34;Animals have helped us quite a lot, so we should return the favour and help them,&#34; marine biologist Emily Sullivan tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n The 25-year-old manages the research aquarium at the Marine Biological Association, which means she&#39;s worked with lots of invertebrates such as octopus, lobster, crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish.\n She feels they should be recognised in the bill - which is currently in the House of Lords.\n  There are already regulations around using animals in scientific research, including octopus and squid - though not all species.\n &#34;The aim of that is to minimise pain, stress and suffering in research,&#34; Emily says.\n  &#34;I personally do think they can recognise and feel pain, so should be protected more.&#34;\n Having interacted with lots of these species, Emily feels they are self-aware and understand what&#39;s around them.\n &#34;It definitely varies between species, and it&#39;s not the same level for all of them. But for example cuttlefish, related to octopus, are very intelligent,&#34; she says.\n &#34;The ones we have here, when you walk past their tank they come up and have a look, see what you&#39;re doing and definitely respond. You can see them watching you.&#34;\n  Emily feels it&#39;s clear when they feel pain or suffering &#34;because their behaviour changes a lot&#34;.\n &#34;They become quite lethargic and their appetite changes. That&#39;s true for a lot of the animals, including crabs and lobsters.&#34;\n  Emily says including them in the bill will have a big impact on the animals themselves because &#34;they aren&#39;t really protected or regulated much&#34;.\n The report found the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million of species such as squid, octopus, crabs and lobsters each year, and says &#34;with so many individuals at stake&#34;, it&#39;s important to be cautious even if there&#39;s not complete certainty these animals are sentient.\n  The new animal welfare legislation will mean any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy.\n That will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.\n A spokeswoman from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Newsbeat the UK was &#34;proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world&#34;.\n &#34;We are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering,&#34; she said.\n She added there is already a review on the feelings of species such as octopus, cuttlefish and squid and the government will &#34;carefully consider the results&#34; of this.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ae0\u9c7c,octopuses,\u52a8\u7269", "title": "MPS\uff1a\u7ae0\u9c7c\u611f\u5230\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "MPs: Octopuses feel pain and need legal protection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-57528249", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ae0\u9c7c", "octopuses", "\u52a8\u7269"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067025, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "zsync\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4f20\u8f93\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4ece\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u60a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6709\u65e7\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u526f\u672c\u3002 zsync\u4ec5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0ersync\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679crsync\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u540c\u6b65\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u5219Zsync\u4e13\u4e3a\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u53d1\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5668\u3002 Zsync\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8f6f\u4ef6 -

It allows you to download a file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as  rsync. However, where rsync is designed for synchronising data from one computer to another within an organisation, zsync is designed for file distribution, with one file on a server to be distributed to thousands of downloaders. zsync requires no special server software \u2014 just a web server to host the files \u2014 and imposes no extra load on the server, making it ideal for large scale file distribution.\n zsync is  open source, distributed under version 2 of the Artistic License. Feedback, bugs reports and patches are welcome.\n  zsync fills a gap in the technology available for large-scale file distribution. Three key points explain why zsync provides a genuinely new technique for file distribution:\n \u2014 zsync uses the rsync algorithm, but runs it on the client side, thus avoiding the high server load associated with rsync.\n \u2014 zsync provides transfers that are nearly as efficient as rsync -z or cvsup, without the need to run a special server application. All that is needed is an HTTP/1.1-compliant web server. So it works through firewalls and on shared hosting accounts, and gives less security worries.\n \u2014 rsync is ineffective on compressed files, unless they are compressed with a patched version of gzip. zsync has special handling for gzipped files, which enables update transfers of files which are distributed in compressed form.\n The special handling of compressed files is, as far as I know, entirely new and unique to zsync. The combination of client-side rsync and HTTP is also unique to zsync, to the best of my knowledge.\n I have put up  technical papers. There is a current paper, which reflects zsync&#39;s latest development, and which I update with new figures as I run new tests and comparisons; there are also older snapshots of the technical paper, included for reference and citation.\n  zsync is only useful if people offer zsync downloads. I have made a deliberate effort to make zsync simple and reliable in use, and easy to deploy.\n \u2014 zsync downloads are offered by building a .zsync file, which contains the meta-data needed by zsync. This file contains the precalculated checksums for the rsync algorithm; it is generated on the server, once, and is then used by any number of downloaders.\n \u2014 .zsync files have a simple text header, so they can be edited with any good editor to change details like the download URL.\n \u2014 The .zsync contains either a relative URL to the full content of the file, so you can either generate and offer it on the same server as hosts the full download (and so it can be distributed like any other file onto mirror sites). Or it can contains one or more absolute URLs (the client will try multiple URLs if necessary to find the content), meaning the .zsync can be hosted on a different server entirely; in fact, the .zsync can be generated and offered by a third party, while still leaving most of the download to the original distribution site.\n Because zsync is a file distribution method, it is useful only when people offer .zsyncs for downloads. It&#39;s a little hard to demonstrate the program and build up a user base because of this. So I am suggesting a number of uses for zsync on the  client page; these include some zsync downloads that I am offering downloads myself to give some immediate use to the program.\n If you are a server operator looking to use zsync for file distribution, see the  server page, which gives some guidance on how to create and offer .zsync files.\n  I am fairly happy with how zsync works so far, but I am still open to new ideas and optimisations. I have made sure that the format is fairly extensible in a compatible way; I expect that users of the current version of zsync will not experience compatibility problems with later versions for the foreseeable future.\n I am also looking to freeze the interface between the zsync library and thecurrent command-line client; I will at some point split zsync into a dynamiclibrary, which implements the format and allows it to be embedded into otherprograms, and the client program. This to some extent depends on whether anyoneis interested in embedding zsync into other programs; if I don&#39;t hear of anyoneintending to do so, this might wait until I have a use for it myself.\n I am interested in  hearing feedback about zsync. Bugs, crashes, and feature suggestions are welcome. Perhaps most of all I am interested in hearing about uses of zsync: I would like to hear about any serious use of zsync, because knowing how people are using it will affect which features I work on. If there are features that you need to enable a particular use, then I would like to hear about that too, particularly anyone that is interested in using zsync as a library as part of a larger program; please note that support for multiple files has already been asked about many times, but due to lack of time I am not likely to work on this in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:01:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7b97\u6cd5,\u4e0b\u8f7d,differential,zsync", "title": "zsync\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528rsync\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728http\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5dee\u5206\u6587\u4ef6\uff082010\uff09 ", "title_en": "Zsync: Differential file downloading over HTTP using the rsync algorithm (2010)", "transed": 1, "url": "http://zsync.moria.org.uk/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7b97\u6cd5", "\u4e0b\u8f7d", "zsync"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cf6f68a0d14132c82f7a2fd3ce349ff6.jpg", "infoid": 1067024, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u867d\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b -

Once seen as a liberatory technology that would usher in an era of creativity and new connections across the globe, many - from casual Twitter users to  professional content creators - have turned on the technology.\nYou can get a sense of the shift in mood from our media output: There&#39;s Netflix&#39;s popular, dystopian reality show &#34; The Circle,&#34; in which contestants cynically compete for money using often fake internet personas. One of the streaming site&#39;s most popular documentaries in the last year was &#34; The Social Dilemma,&#34; which captured viewers&#39; attention with its explanations of Facebook&#39;s privacy faux-pas. And even some of the most buzzed-about novels this year are about the darker sides of the internet, like Lauren Oyler&#39;s &#34; Fake Accounts,&#34; and Patricia Lockwood&#39;s &#34; No One Is Talking About This .&#34; We&#39;re all re-analyzing our relationship to the internet for good reason, but we&#39;ve misclassified what this relationship really is. It&#39;s not like a bad relationship, where you can just walk away, and it&#39;s not like junk food, where you can decide to eat less - it&#39;s an all-encompassing technology, our main economic engine, the tool we are forced to use to meet others and mediate our entire lives.    A solution to our current internet-use crisis cannot come at an individual level anymore than one person quitting their job would solve capitalism&#39;s poor working conditions. If we want any hope of making the internet less stressful, less back-breaking, and more fulfilling, content creators, gig economy workers, and even casual internet users need to push for a systemic solution.  A growing body of evidence suggests that the internet really is terrible for us. A  2018 study of college students found that limiting social media use to 10 minutes a day significantly reduced anxiety in its participants. A  2019 study found that teens who spent more time online were more likely to have mental health conditions.  Other studies find that social media users end up feeling more lonely, more isolated, and less self confident.\nA veritable cottage industry has cropped up to capitalize on people&#39;s knowledge that the internet is bad for them. The web is littered with how-tos on taking a break from social media, and self-help books have been written encouraging us to unplug. There are  several popular TED Talks from former internet engineers and executives telling people that the internet is bad for them and they should leave social media behind.  Retreats for the wealthy which forbid phones and computers have cropped up, and, perhaps most worryingly, the very people who build this technology are  sending their kids to schools where the technology is banned - a tacit admission of its potential to harm people&#39;s minds.        We&#39;re constantly reminded that the internet is bad for us and yet social media use is as high as it&#39;s ever been,  averaging 145 minutes per person per day globally. We&#39;re stuck in a cycle where we know something is bad, we want to stop, and yet, seemingly, we can&#39;t.\n We can&#39;t quit the internet because we&#39;ve conceptualized the problem all wrong. Social media is not an individual addiction that can be addressed at an individual level - it&#39;s a societal problem that needs a societal fix. We need to think of the internet less as a tool we all somehow can&#39;t stop using, and more as a factory we&#39;re required to be in. Our entire society has been reformulated around the internet, much like it was centered around the factory during the Industrial Revolution. If there&#39;s an  Amazon Web Services outage, much of our society stops functioning. Without the internet, we couldn&#39;t find jobs, or, at this point, even friends.     The &#34;gig economy&#34; - the often  underpaid and  exploitative labor performed by Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers - was enabled by the internet, and now  more than a quarter of workers in the US participate in this economy in some form. During the pandemic, office workers were only able to fulfil their required job duties through the internet, and college students forked over full tuition for the privilege of staring at Zoom for hours each day.\n We&#39;re all required to be here - online - for our livelihoods. But even when we&#39;re not required to be here, companies attempt to make sure we still are: App and game developers  use the same science that keeps people playing the slots in Las Vegas to keep us glued to our screens.\nAs culture and media theorist McKenzie Wark  writes in her book &#34;Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?&#34;, the internet uses our labor without us really knowing it. Unlike the broadcast era of media, during which the owners of television networks and movie studios had to at least create the content to sell to us, we now create all the content for each other, mostly without being paid.     &#34;[Social media companies like Facebook] don&#39;t even bother to provide any entertainment,&#34; Wark writes. &#34;We have to entertain each other, while they collect the rent, and they collect it on all social media time, public or private, work or leisure, and (if you keep your FitBit on) even when you sleep.&#34;\n We produce the memes, tweets, posts, and pictures that keep us tethered to the internet, and then that  content is monetized in the form of advertisements - revenue users help produce, but do not usually see a penny of.\nAlthough a very select number of internet users  can get paid for their labor - i.e.  influencers or popular YouTubers - most of us do not. If the internet is a factory, it is one in which the vast majority of people are not getting paid. Instead, users often fight with each other for non-monetary payment  in the form of clout - recognition that we can produce the most and best content for free.   &#34;In some quarters [of society], this affective currency has replaced the wages of industrialization, especially for professionals who used to earn a structured living from paid content and who now disseminate their bylines far and wide in hopes of securing a niche livelihood from name recognition,&#34; the sociologist Andrew Ross  writes. This free or cheap labor has widened income inequality massively, according to some theorists. We fight for followers, retweets, and likes, all for free, while the platforms we&#39;re on profit massively. And only a few, large companies are collecting these profits;  almost 70% of all digital ad spending goes to either Google, Facebook, or Amazon.\nAs Yasha Levine writes in his book &#34; Surveillance Valley,&#34; the internet was never meant to be a place friendly to the average user - it was developed by the US military to spy on people during wars, and then used to spy on Americans at home too. Some of Google&#39;s initial funding  came from grants from US spy agencies. When the infrastructure of the internet was sold off by the US government to private companies, the people who stood to profit off that privatization funded magazines, advertisements, and lobbying to reframe the internet from a surveillance tool to one that could liberate us culturally. As detailed by Levine, Louis Rossetto - the founder of Wired Magazine, the biggest megaphone for evangelizing the new, privatized internet in the 1990s - was an Ayn Rand fan who believed the internet would come to replace the need for a government.     Today we live in this libertarian vision of the internet in which companies exist largely unregulated, undertaxed, and able to do what they want without worry that the government will interfere.\n But now, more people seem to be seeing through the hype. So, the question now is what to do with this new, collective revelation.If the internet is somewhat like a factory, perhaps we should treat it like one. In 2014, the artist Laurel Ptak created a manifesto called  Wages for Facebook in which she argued that Facebook should pay users for their content:     &#34;They say it&#39;s friendship. We say it&#39;s unwaged work. With every like, chat, tag or poke our subjectivity turns them a profit. They call it sharing. We call it stealing.&#34;\n Though Ptak&#39;s work is a piece of art, not a  strategy for changing the web, it could be a starting point. Perhaps we as internet users can organize to stop giving away our hearts and minds for free so that a select few can profit off of them. Just as labor organizers have pushed to make other industries less exploitative, perhaps we need a movement to do the same with the internet.\nAs Levine writes, in 1969, hundreds of students at Harvard gathered to protest the university&#39;s involvement in the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. The students saw it as a dangerous technology that would be used to surveil the entire world. If, at the beginning of the internet, the technology&#39;s potential for harm was already obvious to some, there&#39;s no reason it cannot become obvious to us again. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before enough of us say &#34;enough,&#34; and protest the internet&#39;s totalizing grasp on our labor and our lives.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 20:25:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,internet", "title": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6b63\u5728\u6467\u6bc1\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u8111\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u80fd\u6212\u70df\u3002 \u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u5de5\u5382\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u88ab\u8feb\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u85aa\u6c34\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u5176\u5371\u5bb3\u3002 ", "title_en": "The internet is destroying our brains, but we can't quit.

It\u2019s a glitchy, 10-year-old underdog of a game with a cult following of programmers, engineers, astronaut candidates, and your typical lay explosion enthusiasts, and it has a unique and active community of modders who\u2019ve been fixing bugs, adding new features, and generally keeping the game fresh for nearly a decade.\n In the game, you are the omniscient director of a space program composed of literal little green men (and beloved little green woman Valentina Kerman\u2014we see you, trailblazer) that you send skyward in spacecraft of your own design. It often feels like watching those blurry old videos of rockets launching only to come straight back down in an explosion of fiery schadenfreude: you feel a little bit frightened, a little bit sadistic, and you really want to try it again.\n  One of the most prolific  Kerbal modders is Chris Adderley, Nertea in the game, who is an engineer at the Canadian space company  MDA by day, designing ground-based systems that retrieve data from spacecraft. But in his off time, Adderley gets into the pilot\u2019s seat himself. He started playing  Kerbal Space Program soon after its release, and in 2013 started building his first mod for the game\u2014a pack of spare parts, including a xenon fuel tank and a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (just try saying that three times fast).\n Since then, he\u2019s designed dozens of additional mods, including a Mark IV Spaceplane and space station add-ons like centrifuges and inflatable habitats.\n \u201cI build stuff that I\u2019d like to see us as a species build in the future,\u201d says Adderley.\n Recently, Addlerley decided to take some of the most plausible far-future theoretical rocket engine concepts and build them in the game\u2014introducing a way for gamers to try out these sci-fi  concepts in a simulated environment that can teach us how they might actually work, on a more practical level, in the future.\n    Adderley combed through dozens of scientific papers that outlined theoretical blueprints for these ultra-advanced propulsion systems, looking for those that were most realistic.\n \u201cEverybody tries to sell their project as the propulsion system of the future,\u201d says Adderley. \u201cYou need to kind of think a little bit critically about what people have hand waved.\u201d\n He crunched the numbers, considered how much power a specific engine would need, how to deal with the heat produced, and how you\u2019d harness the energy to propel the virtual rocket further. \u201cThat was superfun, which might be a supernerdy statement, but you know.\u201d\n In the end, he built out 13 different engine concepts, including fusion engines\u2014like   The Expanse&#39;s Epstein drive is theorized to be\u2014fission engines, and antimatter rockets.\n Though we don\u2019t yet have the technology to implement these specific-impulse demons, there is some real world value in being able to simulate advanced engines in a low-stakes environment. In fact, it\u2019s such a great sandbox that engineers at SpaceX and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have used Kerbal graphics in their presentations. In 2018,  NASA released Open MCT, a telemetry data visualization software designed for operating spacecraft, to the public on Github. It\u2019s costly and time-consuming to test these systems on real spacecraft, so some participants ran their programs through Kerbal instead.\n For Sumontro Sinha, an aerospace engineer and fusion researcher at the Propulsion Research Lab at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Kerbal is the go-to for testing out new ideas and training new engineers.\n \u201cInstead of Powerpoint slides and pages of equations, just make the ship and see how it works,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it works in Kerbal, then it has a good chance of working in real life.\u201d\n  The  spherical tokamak fusion engine is based on the fictional spaceship in   2001: A Space Odyssey, sans HAL the killer AI. Adderley found the actual science behind it in  a NASA study, in which the paper\u2019s lead author, Craig Williams, says NASA funded a number of projects focused on developing advanced propulsion systems. Williams\u2019 team designed an engine that uses the energy produced by a fusion reaction to generate thrust. Fusion occurs naturally in the interior of stars like our sun, where lightweight atoms are superheated to the point where their electrons and neutrons decouple and neutrons, normally repellant to one another, fuse together and produce massive amounts of energy. One of the biggest challenges in producing this energy on Earth is that you need a way to confine the resultant plasma and harness its power.\n    One way to do this is with a tokamak, a device that generates a donut-shaped magnetic field that keeps the superheated plasma in place. In Williams\u2019 engine prototype, this tokamak would be nearly spherical\u2014more like a donut hole. The exhaust produced would propel the vehicle to over 166,000 mph, taking passengers to Jupiter in just under 4 months. To put that into perspective, the deep space probe Voyager is traveling away from our solar system at 35,000 mph.\n When Williams\u2019 paper came out in 2001, the authors wrote that the capability to produce this type of engine might be 30 years out. Now that it\u2019s 2021, Williams is revising his estimate. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not any closer,\u201d he says. His paper came out in an era of enthusiasm for advanced propulsion, but much of that zeal has waned until recently. \u201cYou can\u2019t really make much progress when there\u2019s no active program going on, \u201c he says. \u201cUntil you start the clock again, that 30-year projection will just keep moving forward.\u201d Bummer. But in the decades between now and humanity\u2019s era of two-week Saturn vacations, you can still try out your own digital version of Williams\u2019 engine.\n  The Afterburner  fission fragment rocket engine is based on another NASA-funded engine concept study from 2011 that utilizes the energy created in nuclear reactions to propel a spacecraft forward. Reactors filled with  Americium, a highly radioactive rare material that is a byproduct of uranium-driven nuclear reactions, generate fission products that flow down a chamber. This chamber is injected with hydrogen gas, which gets intensely excited when it meets up with the fission fragments and generates a plasma that is funneled through a powerful magnetic nozzle as thrust.\n With this breakthrough, a round trip to Mars would take 292 days, including a 60-day stay on the planet. While the engine is slower overall than a fusion engine would be, it\u2019s far closer to what we\u2019re technologically capable of at present.\n \u201cThe nuclear thermal rocket is a technology that is getting developed, and it\u2019s already been demonstrated,\u201d says Jason Cassibry, who leads the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In April, DARPA  selected three contractors to demonstrate the first phase of a nuclear thermal rocket, and NASA and the DOE put out  a call for similar preliminary designs in February. Cassibry says fission fragment and nuclear pulse engines are not far behind, but they have additional engineering hurdles to face, including figuring out how to divert all that energy away from the hull of the spacecraft so it doesn&#39;t burn up in space.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 19:02:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "space,kerbal", "title": "\u5728Kerbal Space\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2aGen Space Tech ", "title_en": "Test out next-gen space tech in Kerbal Space Program", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/test-out-next-gen-space-tech-in-kerbal-space-program/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["space", "kerbal"]}]
