He has a niche interest — collecting sports playing cards — and is passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. When he went looking for a way to start his own show,  Sports Card Nation, in 2018, Anchor stood out. The podcast creation app, now owned by Spotify, makes it easy to record an episode, and it offers a novel feature for new podcasters: sponsorship opportunities for everyone.</p><p>跳至主要内容John Newman是像Spotify这样的公司想要参与播客的人。他对小众感兴趣-收集体育扑克牌-并且对该主题充满热情和知识。当他去寻找一种方式开始自己的节目《体育卡牌国家》（Sports Card Nation）时，2018年，Anchor脱颖而出。现在由Spotify拥有的播客创建应用程序使录制情节变得容易，并且为新的播客提供了新颖的功能：为每个人提供赞助机会。</p><p> What Newman didn’t expect, however, was that the main advertiser using Anchor’s sponsorship feature would be Anchor itself. Newman says over the course of two and a half years on the platform, he’s had only three sponsors through Anchor: Anchor, Pocket Casts, and a company called The Black Tux. One of those companies, Pocket Casts, didn’t even pay for its sponsorship, a source close to the company confirms — instead, Anchor covered its costs to promote the feature. Newman says both the Pocket Casts and Black Tux sponsorships lasted less than a month and netted him no more than $50 total. Anchor, on the other hand, has paid him around $2,500 to advertise its own service.</p><p> 但是，纽曼没想到的是，使用Anchor赞助功能的主要广告客户将是Anchor本身。纽曼说，在平台上的两年半中，他通过Anchor只有三个赞助商：Anchor，Pocket Casts和一家名为The Black Tux的公司。一位接近该公司的消息人士证实，其中一家公司Pocket Casts甚至没有支付赞助费用，相反，Anchor承担了推广该功能的费用。纽曼说，Pocket Casts和Black Tux的赞助持续了不到一个月的时间，净收入不超过50美元。另一方面，Anchor向他支付了大约2500美元，以宣传自己的服务。</p><p>   Nine podcasters tell  The Verge the same story: Anchor’s sponsorship feature seems to be seriously lacking in sponsors, and they’ve received few, if any, opportunities beyond Anchor or Spotify itself. Three people say they’ve earned thousands from Anchor and Spotify alone. Three also say they have now left or are looking to leave Anchor’s platform because they’re not receiving new sponsors.</p><p>   九位播客向The Verge讲述了同样的故事：赞助商似乎严重缺乏Anchor的赞助功能，而且除了Anchor或Spotify本身之外，他们获得的机会很少（如果有的话）。三个人说他们仅从Anchor和Spotify赚了数千美元。三人还表示，由于没有收到新的赞助商，他们现在已经离开或打算离开Anchor的平台。</p><p> Anchor’s software is designed to let anyone start a podcast just by recording into their phone. It promised to help podcasters monetize those shows through a feature called Anchor Sponsorships, which launched  in November 2018 in the US, just months before  Spotify acquired the company for $140 million. The functionality is akin to something like YouTube ads — advertisers are automatically matched with podcasts that fit their target demographic, and the hosts can then do ad reads for the sponsors and make money.</p><p> Anchor的软件旨在让任何人仅通过录制到手机中就可以开始播客。它承诺通过名为Anchor Sponsorships的功能帮助播客通过这些节目获利，该功能于2018年11月在美国推出，就在Spotify以1.4亿美元收购该公司的几个月前。该功能类似于YouTube广告-广告商会自动与适合其目标受众的播客匹配，然后主机可以为赞助商进行广告阅读并赚钱。</p><p> It’s a radical idea, especially for smaller creators. Typically, advertisers only work with shows that reach tens of thousands of listeners. With Anchor’s approach, sponsors can distribute their ad impressions across many shows, rather than focusing on one or two in a specific network. The hosts can always pass on a sponsorship opportunity, too, if they’re not interested.</p><p> 这是一个激进的想法，特别是对于较小的创作者而言。通常，广告商只能使用能够吸引成千上万听众的节目。借助Anchor的方法，赞助商可以将他们的广告展示次数分配到许多节目中，而不必专注于特定网络中的一两个广告。如果主人不感兴趣，他们也可以随时传递赞助机会。</p><p> “We’re determined to level the playing field for podcast monetization by enabling new creators to get paid and new brand dollars to enter the market,” Anchor said when it announced the feature.</p><p> Anchor在宣布该功能时说：“我们决心通过让新创作者获得报酬和新品牌收入进入市场来为播客货币化创造一个公平的环境。”</p><p>  But it now seems that the grand vision isn’t panning out, and it may in fact be costing Anchor money to keep running. Sponsorships is becoming more of a marketing avenue for Spotify to entice new creators to join its platform and to keep them there.</p><p>  但现在看来，宏伟的愿景并没有实现，实际上可能要花掉Anchor的钱才能继续运转。赞助越来越成为Spotify吸引新创作者加入其平台并保持其地位的营销渠道。 </p><p> Most of the podcasters  The Verge spoke with signed up for Anchor’s sponsorships feature last year and received Anchor itself as their first sponsor. They received $15 for every 1,000 people they reached. These podcasters say their Anchor sponsorships ended in the second half of 2020, and they weren’t offered a possible renewal date or a new sponsor to replace it. Three hosts say they only made around $50. Newman said his sponsorship briefly ended around three months ago, but he emailed with the company, and Anchor switched it back on at a different CPM, or cost per 1,000 listeners. It’s unclear why.</p><p>去年，大多数播客与The Verge进行了交谈，签约了Anchor的赞助功能，并接待了Anchor自己作为其第一个赞助商。他们每到达1000人，就会收到$ 15。这些播客表示他们的Anchor赞助活动已在2020年下半年结束，并且没有提供可能的续约日期或新的赞助商来代替它。三位房东说他们只赚了大约50美元。纽曼说，他的赞助大约在三个月前就结束了，但是他给公司发了电子邮件，Anchor以不同的每千次展示费用或每千名听众的费用重新启用了赞助。目前尚不清楚原因。</p><p> Newman says he hasn’t had a sponsor other than Anchor for the past two years, even though his show has grown and now reaches anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 people per episode. He estimates Anchor has paid him around $2,500 over his nearly two and a half years on the platform. He currently still runs his Anchor sponsorship at a $17 CPM, along with other ads he obtained on his own outside of Anchor.</p><p> 纽曼说，尽管他的节目已经发展壮大，现在每集可容纳1,500至3,000人，但过去两年他除Anchor以外没有其他赞助商。他估计，Anchor在平台上工作了近两年半，已向他支付了大约2500美元。目前，他仍以每千次展示费用$ 17的价格运行自己的Anchor赞助商，以及他自己在Anchor之外获得的其他广告。</p><p>  Blake Chastain, a podcaster who creates two shows including one called  Exvangelical about “coming to terms with the messed up subculture of evangelicalism,” says both his shows lost their Anchor sponsorships last year. His spirituality podcast reliably reaches 2,000 or more people per episode, he says, while the other is nascent. He says he and five other podcaster friends haven’t been matched with a sponsor in months, since the Anchor sponsorship ended, and they’re now looking to move over to Megaphone, a hosting company  recently acquired by Spotify.</p><p>  播客布莱克·查斯坦（Blake Chastain）创作了两场演出，其中包括一场名为“福音派”的节目，内容是“与福音派混乱的亚文化相适应”。他说，他的灵性播客每集可靠地达到了2,000个或更多的人，而另一个是新生的。他说，自从Anchor的赞助活动结束以来，他和其他五个播客朋友几个月都没有与赞助商匹配，他们现在正在考虑转到最近被Spotify收购的托管公司Megaphone。</p><p> Megaphone costs money to use as a hosting provider, but in exchange, it offers an  advertiser marketplace, which allows companies to have their ads inserted into shows that fit their target demographic, similarly to Anchor’s offering. Hosts don’t read the ads, however. The main barrier to entry is that Megaphone only offers its services to shows or networks with 20,000-plus listeners  per episode, which is why Chastain would have to coordinate with other podcasters.</p><p> 扩音器需要花钱才能用作托管服务提供商，但作为交换，它提供了一个广告客户市场，该市场使公司可以将广告插入适合其目标人群的节目中，类似于Anchor的产品。但是，主持人不会阅读广告。进入市场的主要障碍是，扩音器仅为每集具有20,000多听众的节目或网络提供服务，这就是Chastain必须与其他播客进行协调的原因。</p><p> “I feel like Spotify is well-positioned to offer things to indie podcasters, just as much as they are to develop their own in-house stuff by buying outlets like Gimlet, but it just hasn’t materialized yet,” he says. “So that’s sort of why when you’re smaller, you’re just doing stuff on your own, just sort of keep your options open. That’s why we’re exploring that [move to Megaphone].”</p><p> 他说：“我觉得Spotify处于向独立播客提供节目的有利条件，就像他们通过购买Gimlet这样的商店来开发自己的内部商品一样，但它尚未实现。” “所以这就是为什么当您变小时，您只是自己做一些事情，只是让您的选择保持打开状态。因此，我们正在探索[移至扩音器]。”</p><p> Anchor wants to spread the wealth in podcast advertising, but money is seemingly only going to top shows</p><p> Anchor希望在播客广告中传播财富，但金钱似乎只会成为热门节目</p><p> Two other podcasters mentioned receiving sponsorships, in addition to Anchor’s own, including one for a sleep podcast called  Deep Sleep Sounds and one for Spotify itself. The podcaster who received the Spotify sponsorship, Dalton Trigg, says he and his co-host made $1,700 from Anchor and $900 from Spotify while on the platform for approximately a year and a half. They’ve since left Anchor and joined the Blue Wire podcast network with their basketball show,  Mavs Step Back, and use Simplecast for hosting.</p><p> 除Anchor自己的节目外，另外两名播客还提到获得了赞助，其中一名参加了名为Deep Deep Sounds的睡眠播客，另一名参加了Spotify本身。接受了Spotify赞助的播客Dalton Trigg说，他和他的联合主持人在平台上工作了大约一年半，分别从Anchor赚了1,700美元，从Spotify赚了900美元。此后，他们离开了Anchor，加入了Blue Wire播客网络，并参加了篮球表演“小牛后退”，并使用Simplecast进行托管。 </p><p> “We made the switch because after nearly two years of having somewhat consistent ad money, we went two to three straight months at the end of last year where we had no sponsors at all,” he texted  The Verge. “And the NBA offseason is our busiest time of the year for the pod, so that was frustrating for us — that it just all of a sudden cut off. Anchor support kept preaching patience and saying that they’d keep trying to pair us with new sponsors, but it got to the point where we had to make the move so we could continue to grow.”</p><p>他给The Verge发短信说：“我们之所以做出这样的选择，是因为在拥有近两年的稳定广告收入之后，我们在去年年底连续两到三个月根本没有赞助商，” “而NBA休赛期是我们一年中最繁忙的比赛时间，这让我们感到沮丧-突然之间就中断了比赛。主持人的支持一直在鼓吹耐心，并说他们将继续努力将我们与新的赞助商配对，但是到了必须要采取行动，这样我们才能继续发展的地步。”</p><p> The fact that Anchor seems to be bankrolling its own sponsorship feature doesn’t bode well for Spotify, especially considering the critical role Anchor plays in the company’s growth strategy. Anchor offers its software and hosting service for free, which brings new podcasters into the field. It also beefs up Spotify’s own show catalog. The company  told  The Verge that Anchor launched 1 million new shows in 2020 alone and powers 70 percent of Spotify’s podcast catalog. Spotify has signed Anchor creators to exclusive deals, too, and a spokesperson said last month that 100,000 creators had generated revenue through Anchor’s sponsorships product to date.</p><p> Anchor似乎在为其自己的赞助功能提供资金这一事实对于Spotify来说并不是一个好兆头，尤其是考虑到Anchor在公司增长战略中扮演的关键角色。 Anchor免费提供其软件和托管服务，从而使新的播客进入该领域。它还增强了Spotify自己的节目目录。该公司告诉The Verge，仅在2020年，Anchor就推出了100万个新节目，并为Spotify播客目录的70％提供了支持。 Spotify也已经与Anchor创作者签署了独家交易，一位发言人上个月表示，迄今为止，已有10万名创作者通过Anchor的赞助产品创造了收入。</p><p> Anchor Sponsorships is only available in the US, and 100,000 podcasters have made money through it</p><p> 锚赞助商仅在美国可用，并且有100,000个播客通过它赚钱</p><p> Still, the situation all these podcasters depict suggests that while Anchor is attracting creators, it might not be making much money through selling advertisements. In fact, it’s seemingly just spending it. Plus, the success some of these podcasters have had in attracting outside advertisers demonstrates that once they reach a certain audience threshold, they’re sometimes willing to leave Spotify behind.</p><p> 尽管如此，所有这些播客所描述的情况表明，虽然Anchor吸引着创作者，但它可能不会通过出售广告来赚钱。实际上，它似乎只是花钱。另外，其中一些播客在吸引外部广告商方面取得了成功，这表明，一旦他们达到一定的受众群体门槛，他们有时就会舍弃Spotify。</p><p> We reached out to Spotify for information about which other advertisers currently use Sponsorships, as well as how much money the company has spent on these ads, but it declined to comment on the record.</p><p> 我们向Spotify寻求有关当前其他广告商使用赞助商的信息，以及该公司在这些广告上花费了多少钱，但该公司拒绝对此记录发表评论。</p><p> Spotify did put us in touch with the podcast  How Long Gone, however, which launched in March 2020 and is distributed through Anchor with most ads coming from Anchor Sponsorships. The hosts, Jason Stewart and Chris Black, say the majority of their ads market Spotify, Anchor, and Anchor-made shows. Spotify and Anchor have paid them “tens of thousands” of dollars in ad revenue in less than a year, they say. (They also host a separate, Spotify-exclusive show that highlights Anchor’s newest feature — the ability to include music in shows — called  How Long Gone Radio.)</p><p> Spotify确实使我们与2020年3月启动并通过Anchor分发的播客节目How Long Gone保持联系，大部分广告来自Anchor赞助。主持人杰森·斯图尔特（Jason Stewart）和克里斯·布莱克（Chris Black）说，他们的大部分广告市场都是Spotify，Anchor和Anchor制作的节目。他们说，Spotify和Anchor在不到一年的时间内就向他们支付了“数万”美元的广告收入。 （他们还举办了另一场Spotify独家演出，重点介绍了Anchor的最新功能-在节目中包含音乐的功能-叫多久不再广播。）</p><p> “It’s kind of like an interesting ecosystem,” Stewart says. “It’s like a garden that waters itself, as long as you have the good ol’ Spotify deep pockets.”</p><p> 斯图尔特说：“这就像是一个有趣的生态系统。” “只要您有良好的Spotify财力，这就像浇灌花园一样。” </p><p> They’ve had three other sponsors over the show’s existence that came from Anchor Sponsorships, including Manscaped, Solaray, and Roman. All three, they say, ran for around a month each.</p><p>他们在节目的存在中还有其他三个赞助商，这些赞助商来自Anchor赞助商，包括Manscaped，Solaray和Roman。他们说，这三个都跑了一个月左右。</p><p> “It’s good to just be able to have that Spotify and that Anchor as your baseline to where even if you’re making a dollar a day off of it, or whatever, at the beginning, it’s nice to just see that,” says Stewart. “It’s kind of like gambling or something like that. You look into your wallet, and you get to see every day how much more money you’re making, and then it helps you kind of track your growth and your goals, and having Spotify and Anchor there throughout the entire time was an amazing foundation to build on top of.”</p><p> 斯图尔特说：“能够将Spotify和Anchor用作基准，这是很好的，即使您每天从中赚取一美元，或任何其他事情，也很高兴看到这一点。” 。 “这有点像赌博之类的东西。您查看钱包，每天都会看到自己赚了多少钱，然后它可以帮助您跟踪自己的增长和目标，并且在整个过程中始终使用Spotify和Anchor是一个了不起的基础建立在其之上。”</p><p> Analysts at Citi  sent a note to clients last week advising them to sell their Spotify stock, particularly because its podcasting endeavors hadn’t yet resulted in a meaningful uptick in premium subscribers or app downloads. Anchor has, so far, been a creation success story for the company. Even these podcasters, when asked, all say they don’t regret using the app and found it made podcasting approachable. Receiving money from Anchor didn’t hurt, either, and was like a cherry on top.</p><p> 花旗银行的分析师上周向客户发送了一张纸条，建议他们出售Spotify股票，特别是因为其播客努力尚未导致优质订户或应用程序下载量显着增加。到目前为止，Anchor一直是该公司的创作成功故事。即使是这些播客，当被问到时，所有人都说他们不后悔使用该应用程序，并发现它使播客变得平易近人。从Anchor收取的钱也没有受到伤害，而且就像顶上的樱桃一样。</p><p> But did Spotify enter the podcasting space to subsidize creators in making new shows, or to help itself make more money? Anchor’s sponsorship situation seems to be testing that choice.</p><p> 但是Spotify是否进入播客空间来补贴创作者制作新节目或帮助自己赚钱呢？ Anchor的赞助情况似乎正在测试这一选择。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22241066/spotify-anchor-sponsorships-ad-money-spend-podcasting?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/播客/">#播客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/anchor/">#anchor</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
