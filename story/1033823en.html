In the margin, the British publisher Vincent Novello writes that the document was given to him by “Mrs. Streiker” — “one of Beethoven’s oldest and most sincere friends.”</p><p>摩根图书馆和博物馆拥有贝多芬“哈默克拉维尔”钢琴奏鸣曲原版素描的一部分。在页边空白处，英国出版商文森特·诺维洛(Vincent Novello)写道，这份文件是“史翠克夫人”送给他的--“贝多芬最古老、最真诚的朋友之一”。</p><p> Nannette Streicher’s marginalized place in history is encapsulated in these scribbled lines. While she was indeed one of the closest friends of Beethoven, whose 250th birthday will be celebrated this December, she was also one of the finest piano builders in Europe. She owned her own company — employing her husband, Andreas Streicher, a pianist and teacher, to handle sales, bookkeeping and business correspondence. But many Beethoven scholars, perhaps finding it inconceivable that an 18th-century woman could build a piano, have turned Andreas into the manufacturer and Nannette into his shadowy helpmate.</p><p>南妮特·施特莱彻在历史上被边缘化的地位被概括在这些潦草的台词中。虽然她确实是贝多芬最亲密的朋友之一，贝多芬的250岁生日将在今年12月庆祝，但她也是欧洲最好的钢琴制造者之一。她拥有自己的公司--雇佣她的丈夫安德烈亚斯·斯特里谢尔(Andreas Streicher)来处理销售、记账和商务信函。斯特里谢尔是一名钢琴家和教师。但许多贝多芬学者或许认为，18世纪的女性能造出一架钢琴是不可想象的，他们把安德烈亚斯变成了钢琴制造者，把南奈特变成了他神秘的助手。</p><p>  Born in Augsburg, Germany, in 1769, Nannette was the sixth child of Johann Andreas Stein, a renowned manufacturer who developed an innovative piano action, improving on the mechanism that causes the hammers to strike the strings. It became known as the “Viennese action.”</p><p>南奈特1769年出生于德国奥格斯堡，是著名制造商约翰·安德烈亚斯·斯坦(Johann Andreas Stein)的第六个孩子，他开发了一种创新的钢琴动作，改进了导致锤子敲击琴弦的机制。它后来被称为“维也纳行动”(Viennese Action)。</p><p> At 8, Nannette played in front of Mozart, who criticized her posture and grimacing, but admitted that she had “genius.” Two years later, she had mastered many of her father’s building techniques, earning a reputation as a mechanical wunderkind.</p><p>8岁那年，南奈特在莫扎特面前演奏，莫扎特批评她的姿势和鬼脸，但承认她有“天才”。两年后，她掌握了父亲的许多建筑技术，赢得了机械神童的名声。</p><p> After her father’s death in 1792, Nannette, then 23 and recently married, transported the pianos by raft and set up the business in Vienna. She partnered with her 16-year-old brother, Matthäus, changing the company’s name from J.A. Stein to Geschwister (siblings) Stein . It was a time of rapid developments in piano design. With concerts moving beyond aristocratic salons into larger halls, manufacturers were under pressure to produce heavier, more resonant instruments.</p><p>在她的父亲1792年去世后，当时23岁的南妮特刚刚结婚，她用木筏运输钢琴，并在维也纳建立了自己的公司。她与16岁的弟弟马特乌斯(Matthäus)合作，将公司名称从J.A.Stein改为Geschwister(兄弟姐妹)Stein。那是钢琴设计快速发展的时代。随着演唱会从贵族沙龙转移到更大的音乐厅，制造商面临着生产更重、更有共鸣的乐器的压力。</p><p> Beethoven, who had met Nannette in Augsburg years earlier, asked to borrow one of her pianos for a 1796 concert in Pressburg (now Bratislava). Writing to Andreas, Beethoven joked that it was too “good” for him, because he wanted the “freedom to create his own tone.” In a follow-up letter, he complained that the piano was still the least developed of all the instruments and that it sounded too much like a harp.</p><p>贝多芬几年前在奥格斯堡与南奈特相识，她要求借一架钢琴参加1796年在普雷斯堡(现在的布拉迪斯拉发)举行的音乐会。贝多芬在给安德烈亚斯的信中开玩笑说，这对他来说太“好”了，因为他想要“创造自己的音调的自由”。在随后的一封信中，他抱怨说，钢琴仍然是所有乐器中最不发达的，听起来太像竖琴了。</p><p>  The elegant Stein piano, with its light touch and silvery tone, wasn’t ideally suited to Beethoven’s wild and forceful performance style. Taking an obvious swipe at the composer, Andreas wrote an essay describing an unnamed pianist as a brutal murderer at the keyboard, “bent on revenge.”</p><p>这架优雅的斯坦钢琴有着轻盈的触感和银色的音调，不太适合贝多芬狂野有力的演奏风格。安德烈亚斯显然是在抨击这位作曲家，他写了一篇文章，将一位未透露姓名的钢琴家描述为一个残忍的键盘杀手，“一心想要复仇”。</p><p> “Already the first chords will have been played with such violence that you wonder whether the player is deaf,” he wrote.</p><p>他写道：“第一和弦的演奏会非常激烈，你会怀疑演奏者是不是聋了。”</p><p> The comment was sadly prescient. Beethoven had just begun to notice a decline in his hearing, but had told no one. Though he would later need a louder instrument to compensate for his deafness, he was at this point mainly concerned with finding a piano that accommodated his dynamic extremes .</p><p>令人遗憾的是，这一评论颇具先见之明。贝多芬刚刚开始注意到他的听力下降了，但没有告诉任何人。虽然他后来需要一种声音更大的乐器来弥补他的耳聋，但在这一点上，他主要关心的是找到一架能够适应他的动态极端的钢琴。</p><p> Nannette had already expanded her keyboards’ range from five octaves to six and a half, but she was slow to make other major alterations to her father’s original design. It was a stressful time. By 1802, she was the mother of two small children, and a 6-year-old son had recently died. She was also engaged in a dispute with her brother; the siblings eventually decided to dissolve the company and strike out separately.</p><p>南妮特已经把键盘的音域从五个八度扩大到了六个半，但她迟迟没有对父亲最初的设计做其他重大改动。那是一段压力很大的时期。到了1802年，她已经是两个年幼孩子的母亲，一个6岁的儿子最近去世了。她还与哥哥发生了争执；兄弟俩最终决定解散公司，分开罢工。</p><p> Matthäus took an ad in a local newspaper positioning himself as the rightful heir to the Stein name. Nannette, unwilling to relinquish her own claim, established Streicher née Stein. She faced stiff competition from local builders, such as Anton Walter, as well as French and English manufacturers. Beethoven had purchased a French Erard in 1803, but he never stopped pressuring the Streichers to keep pace with his increasingly ambitious compositions.</p><p>马修斯在当地一家报纸上登了一则广告，将自己定位为斯坦名字的合法继承人。南奈特不愿放弃自己的主张，成立了史翠克·尼恩·斯坦(Streicher Née Stein)。她面临着来自安东·沃尔特(Anton Walter)等当地建筑商以及法国和英国制造商的激烈竞争。贝多芬在1803年购买了一架法国Erard，但他从未停止向Streicher夫妇施压，要求他们跟上他日益雄心勃勃的作品的步伐。</p><p> By 1809, Nannette had considerably reworked her father’s design, turning out some of the largest, loudest and sturdiest pianos in Vienna. With a warehouse that produced 50 to 65 grand pianos a year, the Streicher firm was considered by many to be the finest in the city.</p><p>到1809年，南奈特对父亲的设计进行了相当大的修改，生产出了维也纳最大、声音最大、最结实的一些钢琴。这家Streicher公司拥有每年生产50到65架三角钢琴的仓库，被许多人认为是该市最好的公司。</p><p>  In 1812, the Streichers built a 300-seat concert hall adjacent to their showroom; it was decorated with busts of well-known pianists, including a life mask of Beethoven by the sculptor Franz Klein. Concerts there, which attracted the likes of Archduke Rudolf, Beethoven and Andreas’s piano students, became a hub of Vienna’s musical life.</p><p>1812年，斯特里奇夫妇在他们的陈列室旁边建造了一个有300个座位的音乐厅；大厅里装饰着著名钢琴家的半身像，其中包括雕塑家弗朗茨·克莱因(Franz Klein)的贝多芬真人面具。那里的音乐会吸引了鲁道夫大公、贝多芬和安德烈亚斯的钢琴学生，成为维也纳音乐生活的中心。</p><p> Nannette added another job when, in August 1817, she agreed to manage Beethoven’s chaotic household. The composer was going through one of the many crises that marked his life. His hearing had worsened and he was in a creative slump. Having wrested control of his young nephew from his sister-in-law, he needed to give the appearance that he was providing the boy a good home.</p><p>1817年8月，当南妮特同意管理贝多芬混乱的家庭时，她又多了一份工作。这位作曲家正在经历他一生中的众多危机之一。他的听力恶化了，他的创造力也陷入了低迷。在从嫂子手中夺取了对他年幼侄子的控制权后，他需要给人一种他正在为这个男孩提供一个好家的表象。</p><p> Over the next 18 months, Beethoven wrote Nannette over 60 letters, ordering her to take care of his laundry, mend his socks and buy groceries, dusters and shoe polish. Increasingly paranoid, he was convinced that the “beastly” servants were out to rob and poison him, and that they were colluding with his “immoral” sister-in-law.</p><p>在接下来的18个月里，贝多芬给南奈特写了60多封信，命令她帮他洗衣服，帮他补袜子，买杂货、抹布和鞋油。他变得越来越偏执，他相信那些“野兽”仆人是来抢劫和毒死他的，他们与他“不道德”的嫂子勾结在一起。</p><p>  Beethoven’s relationships with women had always been fraught. He fell in love with pretty aristocrats who would never marry a commoner, or else he developed filial attachments to married women. Nannette, with her plain, angular face and hawklike eyes, wasn’t beautiful or highborn. But she was kind and generous; he called her his “good Samaritan.”</p><p>贝多芬与女性的关系一直令人担忧。他爱上了永远不会嫁给平民的漂亮贵族，否则他就对已婚妇女产生了孝顺的感情。南妮特长着一张平凡、棱角分明的脸，眼睛像鹰一样，既不漂亮，也不高贵。但她善良大方，他称她为“好心的撒玛利亚人”。</p><p> Beethoven’s relationship with her may have been his most successful with a woman. She wasn’t oblivious to his shortcomings, telling Vincent Novello, the publisher, that he was “avaricious and always mistrustful.” But by that point, the pianist and piano builder had known each other for over two decades; they had a connection, and were united in their devotion to the piano.</p><p>贝多芬和她的关系可能是他和一个女人最成功的一段关系。她并不是没有注意到他的缺点，她告诉出版商文森特·诺维洛(Vincent Novello)，他“贪婪，总是不信任别人”。但在这一点上，这位钢琴家和钢琴制造者已经认识了20多年；他们有一种联系，并在对钢琴的热爱上团结在一起。</p><p> By assuming his household duties, Nannette cleared the way for Beethoven to write his most ambitious piano sonata, the colossal “Hammerklavier .” It was longer and more difficult than any of his other piano works, ending with a wild fugue. It ushered in some of his greatest works: the “Missa Solemnis,” “Diabelli” Variations and Ninth Symphony. Though he was now using an English Broadwood piano, he confided to Nannette in a letter that the post-1809 Streicher had always been his favorite.</p><p>通过承担家务，南奈特为贝多芬创作他最雄心勃勃的钢琴奏鸣曲--巨著《哈默克拉维耶》扫清了道路。这首曲子比他的其他任何钢琴作品都要长，难度也更大，最后以一首狂野的赋格结束。它带来了他的一些最伟大的作品：《米莎·索伦尼斯》、《迪亚贝利变奏曲》和第九交响曲。虽然他现在使用的是一架英国布罗德伍德钢琴，但他在一封信中向南奈特透露，1809年后的斯特里彻一直是他的最爱。</p><p> Nannette outlived Beethoven by five years, dying in 1833, at 64. The Streicher firm continued to thrive under her son, Johann Baptiste, and then her grandson, Emil, who built pianos for Brahms. When Emil retired, in 1896, the company closed.</p><p>南奈特比贝多芬多活了五年，于1833年去世，享年64岁。在她的儿子约翰·巴蒂斯特(Johann Baptiste)和她的孙子埃米尔(Emil)的领导下，Streicher公司继续蓬勃发展。埃米尔为勃拉姆斯制造钢琴。1896年埃米尔退休后，公司倒闭了。</p><p>  That would seem to have been the end of Nannette’s legacy. But her instruments live on, in museums around the world and in the strong, nimble hands of women she inspired. In the mid-1960s, as Margaret Hood, an artist and calligrapher, raised two young children, she started making harpsichords. After doing research in Europe, she began specializing in reproductions of Streicher pianos, producing them in her Platteville, Wis., workshop. She was building an 1816 Streicher six-and-a-half-octave grand when she died, in 2008.</p><p>这似乎是南奈特遗产的终结。但她的乐器活了下来，在世界各地的博物馆里，在她激励的女性强壮、灵活的手中。20世纪60年代中期，当艺术家兼书法家玛格丽特·胡德(Margaret Hood)抚养两个年幼的孩子时，她开始制作大键琴。在欧洲做完研究后，她开始专门制作斯特里歇尔钢琴的复制品，在威斯康星州普拉特维尔的工作室里生产。2008年去世时，她正在打造一架1816年的斯特里歇尔六度半八度钢琴。</p><p> Anne Acker, who trained as a concert pianist before studying mathematics and computer science, met Ms. Hood in Wisconsin. They bonded over their love of music, and Ms. Hood became Ms. Acker’s mentor. While caring for her children, Ms. Acker began building and repairing harpsichords and antique pianos, and after her friend’s death, she purchased the reproduction Streicher from Ms. Hood’s husband.</p><p>安妮·阿克尔(Anne Acker)在威斯康星州认识了胡德，她在学习数学和计算机科学之前曾接受过音乐会钢琴家的培训。他们因热爱音乐而走到了一起，胡德成为了艾克的导师。在照顾孩子的同时，阿克尔开始建造和修理大键琴和古董钢琴，在她的朋友去世后，她从胡德的丈夫那里买下了这架复制品Streicher。</p><p> “I explained to him that a piano researched and begun by a woman, that is a replica of a piano designed and built by a woman, needs to be finished by a woman,” Ms. Acker said in an interview.</p><p>阿克尔在接受采访时说，“我向他解释说，一架由女性研发并开始制作的钢琴，也就是一架由女性设计和制造的钢琴的复制品，需要由女性完成。”</p><p> The piano — the work of three women over two centuries — had its debut at the Boston Early Music Festival in 2019. It was the year of Nannette’s 250th birthday.</p><p>这架钢琴是两个世纪以来三位女性的作品，于2019年在波士顿早期音乐节上首次亮相。那年是南妮特的250岁生日。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/arts/music/beethoven-piano.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/arts/music/beethoven-piano.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/贝多芬/">#贝多芬</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/built/">#built</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/钢琴/">#钢琴</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
