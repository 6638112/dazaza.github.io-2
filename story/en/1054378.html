The intelligence of the design patterns? The mysteriously blinking lights in server rooms? The revolution of technology and how it improves our lives? The happiness to see other people react to your creations? The agile manifest? The money they promised you? The feeling you helped the world become a better place? The need to have a job? The dirty hacks you invent to deal with something you don’t know? The fact you will never be without a job? The coffee you drink in your breaks? The dream to become the cockiest boss alive? Was it your mom?</p><p>是算法的美吗？设计模式的智能？服务器室中神秘闪烁的灯光？技术的革命以及它如何改善我们的生活？看到其他人的幸福对你的创作作出反应？敏捷清单？他们答应过你的钱？你帮助世界的感觉成为一个更好的地方？需要有一份工作吗？你发明的肮脏的黑客来处理你不知道的东西？你永远不会没有工作的事实？你休息的咖啡？成为最活力的老板的梦想？是你的妈妈吗？</p><p> Can you easily tell what your main driver was? Do you think it  still drives you today or was there something you lost in the process?</p><p> 你能轻松地讲述你的主要司机是什么吗？你认为它仍然驾驶你今天还是在这个过程中丢失了什么？</p><p> I have a story to share. It’s gonna take some time. I will let you prepare a beverage first. Today’s special hot chocolate with whipped cream. Ready? Ok, here we go…</p><p> 我有一个分享的故事。这会花点时间。我会让你先准备饮料。今天的特殊热巧克力用奶油。准备好？好的，我们走了......</p><p>  My middle-age crisis started earlier than the usual. One day I woke up and all of a sudden various philosophical questions besieged my brain.</p><p>  我的中年危机早于平常。有一天，我醒来，突然围困了我大脑的各种哲学问题。</p><p> Who am I? What am I good at? What I am  not good at? How can I contribute to this world and how far am I to make my dreams come true? Am I doing the right job? Am I gonna be successful? What is success anyway? Are we gonna be friends again?</p><p> 我是谁？我擅长什么？我不擅长？我如何为这个世界做出贡献，以及我有多远来实现我的梦想成真？我在做正确的工作吗？我要成功吗？无论如何成功是什么？我们会再次成为朋友吗？</p><p> I felt like something was missing from my life. Something I wanted so badly and I din’t know what. Nothing was giving me joy anymore. The same job. The same place. The same people. The same routine.</p><p> 我觉得我生命中失踪了。我想要这么糟糕的东西，我不知道什么。没有什么能告诉我快乐了。同样的工作。同一个地方。同一个人。同样的例程。</p><p> In the beginning I thought, it wasn’t really necessary putting myself in this trouble. I believed this wasn’t a healthy habit for me. I tried to escape these dark thoughts. Why do you have to feel bad when you are living like a king? You are a software engineer, you have a very nice job, you are working on high scale projects and the list goes on. Why don’t you just post another selfie to tell the world how happy this burger makes you feel? You can find multiple ways to distract your brain. But can you really escape these feelings?</p><p> 在我的想法中，它没有必要把自己放在这个麻烦。我相信这不是对我的健康习惯。我试图逃避这些黑暗的想法。当你像国王生活时，为什么你必须感到难过？您是一个软件工程师，您有一份非常好的工作，您正在研究大规模项目，并列出。你为什么不张贴另一个自拍照告诉世界这汉堡让你感受到了多么高兴？您可以找到多种分散您的大脑的方法。但你能真正逃避这些感受吗？ </p><p> No, you can’t! The more you try to ignore a feeling, the stronger it gets. And you find yourself drowning in this endless feed, that never gives you any satisfaction anymore. I knew I had to  deal with it. I knew I had to  change something.</p><p>不，你不能！你试图忽略一种感觉的越多，它得到的强烈。你发现自己在这个无穷的饲料中溺水，从来没有给你满意。我知道我不得不处理它。我知道我不得不改变一些东西。</p><p> So I did what everybody else does. I opened YouTube and I watched every self-improvement video ever created. You know this feeling when you are not motivated to do anything but you waste your time watching videos about motivation. We’ve all been there. It took me plenty of time to actually try the practices I was watching. And this is when the fun starts.</p><p> 所以我做了其他人的所作所为。我打开了YouTube，我看过每个人都创造的自我改进的视频。当你没有动力做任何事情的时候，你知道这种感觉，除了你浪费你的时间观看有关动机的视频。我们都去过那里。我花了很多时间实际尝试我正在观看的做法。这是乐趣开始的时候。</p><p> I want to share with you what worked best for me. It’s an easy exercise you  can try at home. Spoiler alert: It turned out these thoughts I had from the very beginning were really healthy. I feel very thankful I had to go through all these. In fact, this blog would never been created otherwise.</p><p> 我想和你分享，对我有什么工作。这是一项简单的运动，你可以在家里尝试。 SPOILER ALERT：它结果是我从一开始就真的健康的这些想法。我觉得很感激我必须经历所有这些。事实上，这博客永远不会被制作。</p><p>   Another day was about to end. I was home. Everybody was. The city was empty because of the pandemic. I had the windows closed because I was afraid of the zombies. Better to be prepared for anything. You can’t play games with 2020. I was bored and lost in self-improvement blogs. Suddenly I’ve read about this mind-blowing idea.</p><p>   另一天即将结束。我回家了。每个人都是。由于大流行，这座城市是空的。我有窗户关闭，因为我害怕僵尸。更好地为任何事情做好准备。你不能用2020年玩游戏。我很无聊，在自我改善博客中迷失了。突然间，我读到了这个令人兴奋的想法。</p><p> I opened a portal through time and I asked my young self how he feels watching me in this moment of my life. Was he happy with my progress so far? Was this the future he was dreaming about?</p><p> 我通过时间开设了一个门户网站，我问了我的年轻人，他在我生命中的那一刻看着我。他到目前为止对我的进展感到满意吗？这是他梦寐以求的未来吗？</p><p> It worked! I was able to see my teenage self. He was studying math in my green painted room. My first thought was pretty obvious. Damn my hair needed an extreme makeover. Later on I started talking to him.</p><p> 有效！我能看到我的少女。他在我的绿色彩绘室里学习数学。我的第一个想法非常明显。该死的我的头发需要极端的改造。后来我开始跟他说话。</p><p> At first he was scared. Not because I was able to communicate with him from the future, he was actually thrilled this is possible. He was shocked as I was giving him an update about his future. I will never forget the words he used to describe it.</p><p> 起初他害怕。不是因为我能够与未来与他沟通，他实际上很激动，这是可能的。当我给他一个关于他未来的更新时，他感到震惊。我永远不会忘记他用来描述它的词语。 </p><p>  The guy had a point, so I let him speak. I listened very carefully to the things he had to say. In order to transfer his message, I have to go back to where all this started.</p><p>那家伙有一点，所以我让他说话。我非常仔细地听他不得不说的话。为了转移他的信息，我必须回到所有这一切开始的地方。</p><p>  “Oh great, I know where this is going. He will write the story of his life again.”</p><p>  “哦，很棒，我知道这是在哪里。他会再次写下他的生命的故事。“</p><p> “It’s a personal blog, of course I have to write about my life, what else should I write about?”</p><p> “这是一个个人博客，当然我必须写下我的生活，我还应该写什么？”</p><p> “Please make it quick. It’s hard to keep my eyes open with all this drama.”</p><p> “请快点吧。难以让我的眼睛与所有这些戏剧保持亮相。“</p><p> “I will if you let me write. I thought I’m done with you when I stopped writing my previous blog. How the hell you survived all these years?”</p><p> “如果你让我写的话，我会的。当我停止写上一个博客时，我以为我已经完成了你。这些年来你到底幸存下来？“</p><p> “I thought you’ve stopped writing blogs that nobody is willing to read, but I lost my faith the moment you started opening portals and talking to yourself.”</p><p> “我以为你已经停止写博客，没有人愿意阅读，但我开始打开门户网站并与自己交谈的那一刻。”</p><p> “Ok mister, you got it. I will write the story of my whole life with all the unnecessary details I can think of. I will use as many words as I can. And you know what, you can’t escape reading it, because you are a part of me. In fact, you will read it multiple times until I am happy publishing it.”</p><p> “好的先生，你得到它。我会用我想到的所有不必要的细节写下我一生的故事。我会尽可能多的单词。而且你知道，你无法逃脱阅读它，因为你是我的一部分。事实上，你会多次阅读它，直到我快乐发布它。“ </p><p>  “Yeah, remember this day the next time you will think to interrupt me again.“`</p><p>“是的，记得今天下次你会再次打扰我的那一天。”“</p><p>   When I was a kid, I had an obsession with electronic devices and especially those that had screens. SONY Trinitron TVs, VHS, calculators, CRT monitors, LCD panels and retina displays.</p><p>   当我还是个孩子的时候，我对电子设备造成了痴迷，特别是那些有屏幕的电子设备。索尼Trinitron TVS，VHS，计算器，CRT监视器，LCD面板和视网膜显示。</p><p> I was observing UI interfaces in every possible format. When everybody was watching a trailer for a movie, I was checking the motion graphics. When everyone was refusing to switch from MS DOS to Windows, I was extremely excited with the user interface and the endless possibilities that came along with it. When everyone was bored waiting for a game to load on PlayStation, my mind was running on how they made this loading screen look so nice. It was just so cool!</p><p> 我以各种可能的格式观察UI接口。当每个人都在看电影的拖车时，我正在检查运动图形。当每个人都拒绝从DOS到Windows切换到Windows时，我对用户界面非常兴奋，以及与之过的无穷无尽的可能性。当每个人都很无聊等待游戏加载游戏时，我的思绪正在运行它们如何使这个载入屏幕看起来如此美好。这太酷了！</p><p>  School years were lazy. All I wanted to do was to go back home and turn on my PC. I loved video games. I wanted to play every video game ever created. It was fascinating to watch the technology evolve so rapidly. From text based adventures to Myst and Syberia. From green console terminals to 3dfx. Video games were pushing metal to the maximum. Plus, it was really a pleasure, saving the universe with your friends.</p><p>  学校岁月懒惰。我想做的就是回到家，然后打开我的电脑。我喜欢电子游戏。我想玩有史以来每一个创造的视频游戏。观看技术迅速发展是令人着迷的。从基于文本的冒险到Myst和Syberia。从绿色控制台终端到3DFX。视频游戏将金属推到最大值。此外，它真的很高兴，拯救宇宙和你的朋友。</p><p> I had an interesting hobby back then. I used to buy textbooks, flip their cover and create albums by cutting off pictures from magazines. Later on I started making my own fake computer magazines. Yes, as an only child I did have plenty of time to spend. Other kids had imaginary friends, I had imaginary magazines!</p><p> 然后我有一个有趣的爱好。我曾经购买教科书，通过从杂志上切断图片来翻盖并创建专辑。后来我开始制作自己的假电脑杂志。是的，作为一个唯一的孩子，我确实有足够的时间花。其他孩子有想象中的朋友，我有想象中的杂志！</p><p>   It was very slow to connect and files were taking hours to download. Images were considered luxury. Platforms like Blogspot and Wordpress were getting really popular. It was really easy for someone without any technical skills, like myself, to create their own website.</p><p>   连接和文件正在花几个小时来下载是非常慢的。图像被认为是奢侈品。像博客和WordPress这样的平台非常受欢迎。对于没有任何技术技能的人来说，这真的很容易，就像我自己，创建自己的网站。</p><p> I started a personal blog about video games and technology using Yahoo! Geocities. For the first time someone could  actually read my articles. It wasn’t a successful one, depending on the traffic, but it helped me to expose myself to many activities.</p><p> 我开始使用Yahoo!的个人博客关于视频游戏和技术地理性。第一次真的可以阅读我的文章。这不是一个成功的，取决于交通，但它帮助我把自己暴露给许多活动。 </p><p> I had to play many roles. Coding, storytelling, video editing, graphic design and the list goes on. I was constantly searching for ways to improve my craft. Reading people’s comments and adapting my work according to their feedback. I learned programming by myself before I started my IT studies. Or at least something I was calling programming.</p><p>我不得不玩很多角色。编码，讲故事，视频编辑，图形设计和列表继续进行。我不断寻找改善我的工艺的方法。阅读人们的意见并根据他们的反馈调整我的工作。在我开始IT学习之前，我通过自己学习编程。或者至少我呼叫编程。</p><p> I also made some good friends in the process. People I never met in person until today. We had a lot of interests in common. You see, I couldn’t find schoolmates with the same curiosity about computers. And vice versa. It was strange for me that nobody was excited as I was.</p><p> 我也在这个过程中做了一些好朋友。直到今天我从未见过的人。我们有很多兴趣的共同点。你看，我找不到与计算机的同样好奇的同学。反之亦然。对我来说，这对我来说，没有人兴奋。</p><p> But I was still captivated by user interfaces. This time on the web. Something inside me was making that  click again.</p><p> 但我仍然被用户界面迷住了。这次在网上。我内心的东西正在再次点击。</p><p> It’s those pixels you can’t take your eyes off. All these little details that fit together perfectly.</p><p> 这是你不能把目光移开的那些像素。所有这些少数细节都完美地合适。</p><p> It’s like a living piece of art. You start with an empty canvas. You combine different elements together to construct a composition. You choose the tools, the language and basically you make decisions about every single element. You deal with the technical limitations and any other problems you may face along the way. You try to keep it modern and easy to navigate.</p><p> 这就像一个生活艺术品。你从一个空的画布开始。您将不同的元素组合在一起以构建一个组成。您选择工具，语言，基本上您对每个元素做出决定。您处理技术限制以及您可能面临的任何其他问题。你试图保持现代，易于导航。</p><p> I can’t explain what was keeping me up endless hours working on my blog, without getting anything in return. I didn’t care about money or fame. I didn’t care how many visitors I will reach. It was just my creative space. I was feeling good. I was myself.</p><p> 我无法解释什么是让我在博客上工作的无穷无尽的时间，而不会得到任何回报。我不关心金钱或名声。我不在乎我会达到多少游客。这只是我的创造性空间。我感觉很好。我是我自己。</p><p>   My career as a software developer was a nice continuation of this story. It combines many of the things I like to do. It’s not only a job to me, it’s my hobby too. And I was lucky. Very lucky. It proved to be one of the best in-demand jobs.</p><p>   我作为软件开发人员的职业生涯是一个很好的延续这个故事。它结合了许多我喜欢做的事情。这不仅是我的工作，这也是我的爱好。我很幸运。非常幸运。它被证明是最优惠的工作之一。 </p><p> But trust me, it wasn’t easy to stay in this path. I made plenty of risky choices in my life to retain my ambition. You see, back then IT wasn’t the hottest place to work. Computers were neither cool nor popular as today. Today if you are a software engineer it’s considered kinda cool, back then it was the hobby of the geeks.</p><p>但相信我，留在这条道路并不容易。我生命中冒着大量的风险选择，以保留我的野心。你看，回来不是最热门的工作地点。计算机既不酷也不是今天。今天，如果你是一个软件工程师，它被认为是有点酷，那么它是极客的爱好。</p><p> This desire to make my hobby a profession, forced me to take risky decisions in my life. I refused to work for our family business. I resigned from jobs in profitable companies, for positions that were closer to what I wanted to work on. There was a period I was working 12 hours a day, coding personal projects right after my regular job. For almost two years I was working (almost) without getting paid. But I didn’t care back then.</p><p> 这种渴望使我的爱好成为一个职业，迫使我在我生命中取得冒险的决定。我拒绝为我们的家庭企业工作。我辞职的公司在有利可图的公司中，对于更接近我想要工作的职位。有一段时间我每天工作12小时，在我的常规工作之后编码个人项目。近两年我正在工作（差不多）而不获得报酬。但我不在乎。</p><p> I wanted experience. I knew this would be the best deal for me. I would never have to work anymore.</p><p> 我想要经验。我知道这对我来说是最好的交易。我永远不会再上班了。</p><p> Going for what you love is the best decision you will ever make in your life. It pays  a lot.</p><p> 去寻找你所爱的是你生命中最好的决定。它付出了很多钱。</p><p>  Now I know what was missing from my life. The reason I was not satisfied, even though I gained a lot. I lost my creativity.</p><p>  现在我知道我生命中缺少的东西。我不满意的原因，即使我获得了很多。我迷失了我的创造力。</p><p> It took me 3 years to build this website. I had already the design in Sketch and it was just a matter of a weekend or two to write the code. Every time I was pushing myself to work on it, something was distracting me. I tried different technologies, different ways to organize myself, different hardware, different writing styles, but I never managed to publish it. At the end I was always giving up. I wasn’t satisfied with anything I was producing.</p><p> 我花了3年来建造这个网站。我已经在草图中设计了设计，这只是一个周末或两个写代码的问题。每次我都在推动自己工作，事情会分散我的注意力。我尝试了不同的技术，不同的方式来组织自己，不同的硬件，不同的写作风格，但我从未设法发布它。最后我总是放弃。我对我产生的任何东西都不满意。</p><p> It wasn’t a project a kid was making with  love, persuading to become a successful developer. It was a project a “successful” developer was making with  fear, persuading not to be perceived as a kid. And guess what. He was constantly failing.</p><p> 这不是一个孩子在一起的一个项目，说服成为一个成功的开发商。这是一个项目“成功”开发商正在恐惧，说服不被视为一个孩子。你猜怎么着。他不断失败。 </p><p>   Find what you love to do. Put your heart and soul in it. Make it your profession. You need a job that embodies who you are. Expose yourself to new ideas, learn new things, meet people who share the same passion, take more risks.</p><p>找到你喜欢做的事情。把你的心灵和灵魂放在其中。让它成为你的职业。你需要一个体现你的工作。让自己揭示新的想法，学习新事物，遇到共同激情的人，采取更多风险。</p><p> If you haven’t found yet what drives you, I have a tip for you. Take an empty piece of paper. Write down what drives you, what are you curious about. What makes you lose the sense of time. What are the tasks you are willing to do that everybody else doesn’t. You got it? Great.</p><p> 如果您还没有找到驱动您的是什么，我有一个提示。拿一张空纸。写下驱动你的东西，你好奇了。是什么让你失去了时间感。你愿意这样做的任务是什么，其他人都没有。你说对了？伟大的。</p><p>  Start simple. Schedule the time that you’ll spend working on your craft, without any interruptions. No internet, no phones, no messages and no people around you. One hour at a time is enough. Don’t set any goals. Just let yourself free.</p><p>  开始简单。安排你花在工艺上的时间，没有任何中断。没有互联网，没有手机，没有消息，没有人在你身边。一次一小时就足够了。不要设置任何目标。只是让自己自由。</p><p> You will see your motivation will increase as time goes. You will find more interesting things to work on. You will meet inspiring people and at the same time you will inspire others. You will leave your comfort zone.</p><p> 随着时间的推移，您将看到您的动机会增加。您会找到更有趣的事情来工作。您将在激励人们见面，同时您将激励他人。你会留下你的舒适区。</p><p> Working on what you love will give you the courage to carry on. You will be confident to take risks you weren’t able to take before. To quit this boring job. To start a business. To produce something good. To be you.</p><p> 致力于你所爱的东西会给你勇气继续。您将对您无法采取的风险充满信心。退出这种无聊的工作。开展业务。产生好事。成为你。</p><p> Scary isn’t it? Just give it a try. You don’t have anything to lose.</p><p> 可怕不是吗？只是给它一个尝试。你没有任何东西失去。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://nicotsou.com/2021-03-21-why-I-became-a-software-engineer/">https://nicotsou.com/2021-03-21-why-I-became-a-software-engineer/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件工程师/">#软件工程师</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/software/">#software</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
