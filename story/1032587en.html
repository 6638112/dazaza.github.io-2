They created something much bigger.</p><p>人们不和谐的创始人只是想创造一种与他们的游戏玩家朋友交谈的方式。他们创造了更大的东西。</p><p>     Most longtime Discord users have a similar origin story. They liked playing video games, and liked playing with their friends, so they used TeamSpeak or Skype to talk to their friends in-game. They mostly hated TeamSpeak and Skype, but they were really the only options.</p><p>大多数长期使用不和谐的用户都有类似的起源故事。他们喜欢玩电子游戏，喜欢和朋友一起玩，所以他们在游戏中使用TeamSak或Skype与朋友交谈。他们最讨厌的是TeamSak和Skype，但它们确实是唯一的选择。</p><p> Eventually, a lot of those gamers realized something. They wanted to talk to their gaming friends even when they weren&#39;t in a game, and they wanted to talk about things other than games. Their gaming friends were their real friends. As luck would have it, in early 2015, a new tool called Discord showed up on the market. Its tagline was not subtle: &#34;It&#39;s time to ditch Skype and TeamSpeak.&#34; It had text chat, which was cool, but mostly it did voice chat better than anybody else.</p><p>最终，许多游戏玩家意识到了一些事情。他们想和他们的游戏朋友聊天，即使他们不在游戏中，而且他们想谈论游戏以外的事情。他们的游戏朋友才是他们真正的朋友。幸运的是，2015年初，一款名为不和谐的新工具出现在市场上。它的口号并不微妙：现在是时候抛弃Skype和TeamSak了。它有短信聊天功能，这很酷，但大多数情况下，它的语音聊天比任何人都要好。</p><p>  Early users set up private servers for their friends to play together, and a few enterprising ones set up public ones, looking for new gamer buds. &#34;I don&#39;t have a lot of IRL friends that play games,&#34; one Discord user, who goes by Mikeyy on the platform, told me. &#34;So when I played Overwatch, I started my first community … to play games with anyone on the internet. You&#39;d play a couple of games with someone, and then you&#39;re like, &#39;Hey, cool, what&#39;s your Discord?&#39;&#34;</p><p>早期的用户为他们的朋友设置私人服务器，以便一起玩，少数有进取心的用户建立公共服务器，寻找新的游戏玩家。我没有很多玩游戏的IRL朋友，一位在该平台上名为Mikeyy的不和谐用户告诉我。所以当我玩“守望”时，我开始了我的第一个社区…。在互联网上和任何人玩游戏。你会和某人玩几个游戏，然后你就会觉得，嘿，酷，你的不和谐是什么？</p><p>  Fast-forward a few years, and Discord is at the center of the gaming universe. It has more than 100 million monthly active users, in millions of communities for every game and player imaginable. Its largest servers have millions of members. Discord&#39;s slowly building a business around all that popularity, too, and is now undergoing a big pivot: It&#39;s pushing to turn the platform into a communication tool not just for gamers, but for everyone from study groups to sneakerheads to gardening enthusiasts. Five years in, Discord&#39;s just now realizing it may have stumbled into something like the future of the internet. Almost by accident.</p><p>快进几年后，不和谐是游戏世界的中心。它拥有超过1亿的月度活跃用户，在数百万个社区中，每一款游戏和玩家都能想到。它最大的服务器有数百万会员。“不和谐”也在围绕着如此受欢迎的人气慢慢建立业务，现在正在经历一次重大转型：它正在推动将该平台转变为一个沟通工具，不仅面向游戏玩家，也面向从学习小组到偷偷摸摸再到园艺爱好者的每一个人。五年过去了，“不和谐”刚刚意识到它可能已经跌跌撞撞地进入了互联网的未来。几乎是偶然的。</p><p>  Pivots are actually crucial to the history of Discord. It wouldn&#39;t exist without them. Before he was trying to reinvent communication, co-founder Jason Citron was just one of those kids who wanted to play games with his friends. &#34;That was the era of, like, Battle.net,&#34; he told me (in a Discord chat, of course). &#34;I was playing a lot of Warcraft online, dabbled in MMOs a little bit, Everquest.&#34; At one point he almost didn&#39;t finish college thanks to too many hours spent playing World of Warcraft.</p><p>支点实际上对不和谐的历史至关重要。没有他们，它就不会存在。在试图重塑沟通方式之前，联合创始人杰森·西特隆只是那些想和朋友们玩游戏的孩子中的一员。那是战网时代，他告诉我(当然是在一次不和谐的聊天中)。我在网上玩了很多魔兽争霸游戏，稍微涉猎了网游游戏“魔兽争霸”(Everquest)。有一段时间，由于玩魔兽世界的时间太多，他几乎没有读完大学。</p><p>  Citron learned to code because he wanted to make games, and after graduating set out to do just that. His first company started as a video game studio and even launched a game on the iPhone App Store&#39;s first day in 2008. That petered out and eventually pivoted into a social network for gamers called OpenFeint, which Citron described as &#34;essentially like Xbox Live for iPhones.&#34; He sold that to the Japanese gaming giant Gree, then started another company, Hammer &amp; Chisel, in 2012 &#34;with the idea of building a new kind of gaming company, more around tablets and core multiplayer games.&#34; It built a game called Fates Forever, an online multiplayer game that feels a lot like League of Legends. It also built voice and text chat into the game, so players could talk to each other while they played.</p><p>Citron之所以学习编程，是因为他想做游戏，毕业后，他开始着手做这件事。他的第一家公司最初是一家视频游戏工作室，甚至在2008年iPhone应用商店的第一天就推出了一款游戏。后来，这家公司逐渐淡出市场，最终发展成为一个面向游戏玩家的社交网络，名为OpenFeint，雪铁龙将其描述为本质上类似于iPhone的Xbox Live。他将其卖给了日本游戏巨头格力，然后在2012年创办了另一家公司--锤子游戏公司，目的是打造一家新型游戏公司，更多地围绕平板电脑和核心多人游戏展开。该公司开发了一款名为“永远的命运”的游戏，这是一款感觉很像英雄联盟的在线多人游戏。它还在游戏中内置了语音和文本聊天，这样玩家就可以在玩游戏的同时相互交谈。</p><p>  And then that extremely Silicon Valley thing happened: Citron and his team realized that the best thing about their game was the chat feature. (Not a great sign for the game, but you get the point.) This was circa 2014, when everyone was still using TeamSpeak or Skype and everyone still hated TeamSpeak or Skype. Citron and the Hammer &amp; Chisel team knew they could do better and decided they wanted to try.</p><p>然后硅谷发生了一件极端的事情：Citron和他的团队意识到他们的游戏最好的地方就是聊天功能。(对于这个游戏来说，这不是一个很好的迹象，但你明白了。)。这大约是在2014年，当时每个人都还在使用TeamSak或Skype，每个人都还讨厌TeamSak或Skype。雪铁龙和锤子凿子团队知道他们可以做得更好，并决定尝试一下。</p><p> It was a painful transition. Hammer &amp; Chisel shut down its game development team, laid off a third of the company, shifted a lot of people to new roles and spent about six months reorienting the company and its culture. It wasn&#39;t obvious its new idea was going to work, either. &#34;When we decided to go all in on Discord, we had maybe 10 users,&#34; Citron said. There was one group playing League of Legends, one WoW guild and not much else. &#34;We would show it to our friends, and they&#39;d be like, &#39;This is cool!&#39; and then they&#39;d never use it.&#34;</p><p>这是一个痛苦的过渡。Hammer&amp；Chisel关闭了其游戏开发团队，裁减了公司三分之一的员工，将许多人调到了新的职位，并花了大约6个月的时间重新定位公司及其文化。它的新想法是否会奏效也不是很明显。当我们决定全力以赴处理不和谐时，我们可能有10名用户，雪铁龙说。只有一组人在玩英雄联盟，一个魔兽世界协会，没有太多其他的东西。我们会把它拿给我们的朋友看，他们会说，这太酷了！然后他们就再也不会用它了。</p><p>  After talking to users and seeing the data, the team realized its problem: Discord was better than Skype, certainly, but it still wasn&#39;t very good. Calls would fail; quality would waver. Why would people drop a tool they hated for another tool they&#39;d learn to hate? The Discord team ended up completely rebuilding its voice technology three times in the first few months of the app&#39;s life. Around the same time, it also launched a feature that let users moderate, ban and give roles and permissions to others in their server. That was when people who tested Discord started to immediately notice it was better. And tell their friends about it.</p><p>在与用户交谈并看到数据后，团队意识到了它的问题：“不和谐”当然比Skype好，但它仍然不是很好。通话会失败，质量会动摇。为什么人们要放弃一种他们讨厌的工具，去换一种他们会学着讨厌的工具呢？在这款应用程序问世的头几个月里，“不和谐”团队最终三次彻底重建了它的语音技术。大约在同一时间，它还推出了一项功能，允许用户对其服务器中的其他人进行审核、禁止和授予角色和权限。这就是测试不和谐的人立即开始注意到它更好的时候。把这件事告诉他们的朋友。</p><p> Discord now claims May 13, 2015, as its launch day, because that was the day strangers started really using the service. Someone posted about Discord in the Final Fantasy XIV subreddit, with a link to a Discord server where they could talk about a new expansion pack. Citron and his Discord co-founder, Stan Vishnevskiy, immediately jumped into the server, hopped into voice chat and started talking to anyone who showed up. The Redditors would go back, say &#34;I just talked to the developers there, they&#39;re pretty cool,&#34; and send even more people to Discord. &#34;That day,&#34; Citron said, &#34;we got a couple hundred registration[s]. That kind of kicked the snowball off the top of the mountain.&#34;</p><p>不和谐现在宣布2015年5月13日为其发布日，因为那是陌生人开始真正使用这项服务的日子。有人在最终的幻想XIV子编辑网上发布了关于不和谐的帖子，并提供了一个指向不和谐服务器的链接，在那里他们可以谈论新的扩展包。雪铁龙和他不和谐的联合创始人斯坦·维什涅夫斯基(Stan Vishnevski)立即跳到服务器上，跳到语音聊天中，开始与任何出现的人交谈。编辑们会回去，比方说，我刚刚和那里的开发人员谈过，他们非常酷，甚至会派更多的人来挑拨离间。那天，雪铁龙说，我们收到了几百份注册。这有点像是把雪球从山顶上踢掉了。</p><p>   One user, who goes by Vind on Discord, was among Discord&#39;s earliest cohort of users. He and his Battlefield 4-playing friends ditched TeamSpeak for the app, right as they were also starting to do more than just talk about Battlefield. &#34;We were moving away from being purely about the game to being more about a general community.&#34; Discord let them set up different channels for different conversations, keep some order in the chaos, and jump in and out as they wanted. But Vind said one feature particularly stood out: &#34;Being able to just jump on an empty voice chat, basically telling people, &#39;Hey, I&#39;m here, do you want to join and talk?&#39;&#34;</p><p>一位名为“不和谐”的用户是“不和谐”网站最早的一批用户之一。他和他的战地4游戏的朋友们抛弃了TeamSak，转而使用这款应用程序，因为他们也开始做更多的事情，而不仅仅是谈论战场。我们正在从纯粹的游戏转向更多的关于一般社区。不和谐让他们为不同的对话建立不同的渠道，在混乱中保持一些秩序，随心所欲地进出。但温德说，有一项功能特别突出：能够跳到一个空的语音聊天上，基本上就是告诉人们，嘿，我在这里，你想加入进来聊天吗？</p><p> Almost everyone I talked to picked that same example to explain why Discord just feels different from other apps. Voice chatting in Discord isn&#39;t like setting up a call, it doesn&#39;t involve dialing or sharing a link and password or anything at all formal. Every channel has a dedicated space for voice chat, and anyone who drops in is immediately connected and talking. The better metaphor than calling is walking into a room and plopping down on the sofa: You&#39;re simply saying, I&#39;m here, what&#39;s up?</p><p>与我交谈过的几乎每个人都选择了同样的例子来解释为什么“不和谐”给人的感觉与其他应用程序不同。不和谐的语音聊天不像建立电话，它不涉及拨号或共享链接和密码或任何正式的东西。每个频道都有专门的语音聊天空间，任何来访的人都会立即连接并交谈。比打电话更好的比喻是走进一个房间，扑通一声坐在沙发上：你只是在说，我在这里，怎么了？</p><p>  Add that to the list of things about Discord that turned out to be unexpectedly powerful. In retrospect, of course, it feels obvious. Vishnevskiy describes it as feeling like &#34;a neighborhood, or like a house where you can move between rooms,&#34; which is a radically different thing than most online social tools. It had no gamification systems, no follower counts, no algorithmic timelines. &#34;It created a place on your computer and on your phone,&#34; Citron said, &#34;where it felt like you friends were just around, and you could run into them and talk to them and [hang] out with them.&#34; You open up Discord and see that a few of your friends are already in the voice channel; you can just hop in.</p><p>把这一点添加到关于不和谐的事情清单上，结果证明这些事情是出人意料的强大。当然，回想起来，这是显而易见的。维什涅夫斯基将其描述为感觉就像一个社区，或者像一座可以在房间之间移动的房子，这与大多数在线社交工具截然不同。它没有游戏化系统，没有追随者计数，没有算法时间表。它在你的电脑和手机上创造了一个地方，雪铁龙说，在那里你感觉你的朋友就在附近，你可以碰见他们，和他们交谈，和他们[闲逛]在一起。你打开不和，发现你的几个朋友已经在语音频道上了；你可以直接跳进去。</p><p>  From a technical perspective, none of this is easy. &#34;It definitely requires a different way of architecting the system,&#34; Vishnevskiy said. Discord spent a long time working on making it easy to be in a voice channel on your phone, then seamlessly switch when you open Discord on your computer. And it continues to work on latency, the enemy of every real-time communications developer.</p><p>从技术角度来看，这一切都不容易。维什涅夫斯基说，这肯定需要一种不同的系统架构方式。Discorde花了很长时间才能轻松地进入手机的语音通道，然后在电脑上打开Discorde时无缝切换。它还在继续解决延迟问题，这是每个实时通信开发人员的敌人。</p><p> More recently, the company has added video chat to the stack, believing that was the next level of high-fidelity conversation Discord needed. The team wanted to build a way to screen-share during a game, basically creating a small-group or private Twitch that would let users stream games with their friends watching. Doing that in 4K, at 60 frames per second, was hard enough. They weren&#39;t sure how to add it, either: Should they add a separate channel for video, or would users have a hard time choosing between voice and video? They eventually added it into the voice channel, turning it into an incremental step up from voice rather than a separate thing.</p><p>最近，该公司将视频聊天添加到堆栈中，认为这是高保真对话不和谐所需的下一个级别。该团队想要建立一种在游戏期间分享屏幕的方式，基本上是创建一个小群组或私人Twitch，让用户在朋友观看的情况下流媒体游戏。在4K下，以每秒60帧的速度做到这一点已经够难的了。他们也不确定如何添加：他们是应该为视频添加一个单独的频道，还是用户很难在语音和视频之间做出选择？他们最终将其添加到语音通道中，将其转变为语音的递增步骤，而不是单独的东西。</p><p>  There&#39;s not much that Discord does that users strictly can&#39;t do elsewhere. On one hand, it&#39;s a lot like Slack, blending public channels with easy side-chats and plenty of ways to rope in the right people. It&#39;s also a bit like Reddit, full of ever-evolving conversations that you can either try to keep up with or just jump into when you log in. (In fact, a lot of popular subreddits now have dedicated Discords, for more real-time chat among Redditors.) It uses simple status indicators to show who&#39;s online and what they&#39;re up to. But by putting all those things together, in a way that felt more like hanging out than doing work, Discord found something remarkable. Everybody talks about the notion of the Third Place, but nobody&#39;s come closer to replicating it online than Discord.</p><p>严格说来，用户在其他地方做不到的不和谐之处并不多。一方面，它很像Slake，将公共渠道与轻松的边聊结合在一起，并有很多方法来吸引合适的人。它也有点像Reddit，充满了不断变化的对话，你可以试着跟上，也可以在登录时直接跳进去。(事实上，许多受欢迎的Subreddit现在都有专门的不和谐音，以便ReddEditor之间进行更多的实时聊天。)。它使用简单的状态指示器来显示谁在线，以及他们在做什么。但是，通过将所有这些事情放在一起，以一种更像是闲逛而不是工作的方式，不和谐发现了一些不同寻常的东西。每个人都在谈论第三名的概念，但没有人比不和谐更接近于在网上复制它。</p><p> Beyond just making sure things work right, flexibility is key to Discord. The ladder of communications, from text to voice to video, has always been important to get right. Communities can decide who gets access to certain tools and design their space however they want. But it goes even deeper: If you&#39;re in a video chat, for example, you can choose whose video you&#39;re seeing, not just whether yours is on or not. You can also be in multiple chats at once, blending one into the background while focusing on another. &#34;It&#39;s supposed to all work in harmony,&#34; Vishnevskiy said, &#34;but not focus you on something specific like a Google Meet or a Zoom. Doing it passively is also a core feature.&#34; When users say Discord just feels better, that&#39;s usually what they&#39;re talking about.</p><p>除了确保工作正常之外，灵活性也是不和谐的关键。沟通的阶梯，从文本到语音再到视频，一直以来都是保证正确的重要因素。社区可以决定谁可以访问某些工具，并随心所欲地设计他们的空间。但它更深入：例如，如果你在视频聊天中，你可以选择你正在看的是谁的视频，而不仅仅是你的视频是否打开。您还可以同时进行多个聊天，将一个内容混合到背景中，同时将焦点放在另一个内容上。维什涅夫斯基说，这一切都应该和谐地工作，但不能把你的注意力集中在谷歌会议或缩放等特定的事情上。被动地做也是一个核心特征。当用户说不和谐只是感觉更好时，这通常就是他们在谈论的。</p><p>  While Zoom, Teams and others focused on building teleconferencing features — breakout rooms, Q&amp;A, integration with work tools, transcripts, that sort of thing — Discord has continued drilling down on quality and latency. &#34;We invested a lot in integration with GPUs and stuff like that, really deeply,&#34; Vishnevskiy said. &#34;Voice was solved long ago at scale, but we wanted to solve it with 1,000 people in a voice channel … and they could be all talking at sub-millisecond latency. That&#39;s not important for people on a teleconference call.&#34; Turns out, though, it was important for a lot more than gaming.</p><p>虽然Zoom、团队和其他公司专注于打造电话会议功能-分组会议室、问答、与工作工具的集成、文字记录等等-但在质量和延迟方面的分歧仍在继续。维什涅夫斯基说：我们在与GPU之类的东西集成方面投入了大量资金，真的非常深入。语音在很久以前就已经规模化解决了，但我们希望在语音通道…中与1,000人一起解决它。它们可能都在以亚毫秒的延迟通话。对于参加电话会议的人来说，这并不重要。然而，事实证明，这比游戏重要得多。</p><p>  As Discord grew, so too did some of its communities. And pretty quickly, many of them took on lives outside of games. Vind found himself running a pretty large community, about  all things Formula 1 racing, not long after he joined Discord. &#34;I was actually not the creator of it,&#34; he said. &#34;Someone else created it and then basically abandoned it immediately.&#34; Vind joined at the very beginning, in 2016, when there were only 50 or so people on the server. He checked to see who owned the server — and thus had complete control over it — and found it was a totally uninvolved Discord user. Vind eventually tracked him down on Reddit, and asked him for admin privileges so he could add some new features. &#34;And then he just gave me ownership,&#34; Vind explained. The guy was focused on creating a Formula 1 group on Kik, which he thought was going to be the better platform. (Whoops.)</p><p>随着不和谐的加剧，它的一些社区也在增长。很快，他们中的许多人开始了游戏之外的生活。在加入不和谐组织后不久，温德发现自己管理着一个相当大的社区，关于一级方程式赛车的所有事情。他说，实际上我不是它的创造者。有人创建了它，然后几乎立即放弃了它。Vind在2016年一开始就加入了它，当时服务器上只有50个左右的人。他检查了一下谁拥有服务器-因此完全控制了它-发现这是一个完全不参与的不和谐用户。Vind最终在Reddit上找到了他，并向他索要管理员权限，这样他就可以添加一些新功能。然后他就把所有权给了我，温德解释说。这家伙专注于在Kik上创建一个一级方程式车队，他认为这将是一个更好的平台。(哎呀。)。</p><p>  Vind&#39;s goal was to build a big community, but not around any particular game. Or even necessarily around racing. &#34;I wanted to build something that was more of a general community, where people feel welcome and just share the interest of Formula 1.&#34;</p><p>Vind的目标是建立一个大社区，但不是围绕任何特定的游戏。甚至不一定是在赛车附近。我想建立一个更一般的社区，在那里人们感到受欢迎，只是分享一级方程式的兴趣。</p><p> The Formula 1 server now has more than 5,700 users. The history of the internet says that groups of that size almost inevitably devolve into some kind of messy chaos, making moderation and community-building hard to keep up with. Vind said there have been challenges, sure, but for the most part things have worked OK. Discord&#39;s moderation bot, named CarlBot, does a pretty good job of automatically deleting problematic messaging and alerting the mods. &#34;And then if that happens, we ban them,&#34; Vind said. &#34;We don&#39;t want anyone who uses that kind of language in the community.&#34; Those are the rules. When users join the Formula 1 server, they have to read and agree to those rules before they&#39;re allowed to post.</p><p>一级方程式赛车现在有超过5700名用户。互联网的历史表明，如此规模的群体几乎不可避免地会陷入某种混乱，使得温和和社区建设难以跟上。温德说，当然，挑战是存在的，但总的来说，事情运行得很好。“不和谐”的审核机器人CarlBot在自动删除有问题的消息和提醒MODS方面做得相当好。如果发生这种情况，我们就会禁止他们，温德说。我们不希望任何人在社区里使用这种语言。这些都是规定。当用户加入一级方程式赛车服务器时，他们必须阅读并同意这些规则，然后才能发帖。</p><p>   Not everyone has it so good. Discord&#39;s troubles with problematic content are  epic and  well-documented. It has at various times been a home to members of the 4chan and 8chan crowd; a number of &#34;Kool Kids Klub&#34; servers that are only barely disguised KKK groups; and countless examples of online bullying, hate speech and other kinds of awful behavior. It pops up everywhere. What happens on the platform isn&#39;t necessarily meaningfully different from, say, what happens on Reddit or Facebook, but experts have said they worry about Discord because its semi-private nature and small team make it harder to police. Since Discord&#39;s users skew young, there are even more challenges.</p><p>不是每个人都过得这么好的。不和谐的麻烦与有问题的内容是史诗般的，并有很好的记录。在不同时期，它曾是4chan和8chan人群的成员之家；一些几乎不加掩饰的KKK团体的Kool Kids Klub&34；服务器；以及无数网络欺凌、仇恨言论和其他可怕行为的例子。它随处可见。该平台上发生的事情与Reddit或Facebook上发生的事情不一定有什么重大不同，但专家们表示，他们担心不和谐，因为它的半私密性质和小团队让监管变得更加困难。由于“不和谐”的用户年龄偏小，因此面临的挑战甚至更多。</p><p> Discord employees now admit they noticed this too late. The problematic content on the platform only became an urgent issue after the deadly protests in Charlottesville in 2017, which had been planned and discussed openly on Discord for a long time before the event. Before that, there was no Trust and Safety team at Discord; Sean Li, who leads that team, joined the company about a month before Charlottesville. And for too long, the company thought its job was just to keep the worst stuff — the porn, the racial slurs, the flagrantly illegal content — off the platform. It turned a blind eye to the rest, figuring that because it wasn&#39;t a public space, what was the harm? Just don&#39;t join the server, and nobody can come after you.</p><p>不和谐员工现在承认，他们注意到这一点太晚了。平台上的问题内容只是在事件发生后才成为一个紧迫的问题。</p><p>  Now they see it differently. &#34;Discord is like a country with 100 million inhabitants, living in different states and towns,&#34; Li said. &#34;We make the rules on what is allowed to help shape the society at large, and we empower server moderators and admins to help us enforce and expand upon them based on the needs of their communities.&#34; He wants to help moderators create whatever kind of community they want, and Discord&#39;s also getting better at giving moderators the tools and knowhow to do so, but only within the boundaries set by the broader platform. Those didn&#39;t exist for too many years. Now, Discord&#39;s trying simply to be clear and forceful about what&#39;s acceptable and what isn&#39;t, and to enforce those rules consistently. It&#39;s investing in bots and other automated mod tools, but the Trust and Safety team now makes up more than 15% of Discord&#39;s staff. While there&#39;s still plenty of bad stuff on the platform, progress seems to be strong.</p><p>现在他们的看法不同了。李说，不和谐就像一个有1亿居民的国家，生活在不同的州和城镇。我们制定规则，规定什么可以帮助塑造整个社会，我们授权服务器版主和管理员根据他们社区的需求来帮助我们实施和扩展这些规则。他想帮助版主创建他们想要的任何类型的社区，而不和谐组织也越来越善于为版主提供工具和诀窍来做到这一点，但只能在更广泛的平台设定的边界内。这些东西很多年前就不存在了。现在，“不和谐”试图简单地明确和有力地说明什么是可以接受的，什么是不可以接受的，并始终如一地执行这些规则。它正在投资于机器人和其他自动化的国防部工具，但信任和安全团队现在占不和谐公司员工总数的15%以上。虽然这个平台上仍然有很多不好的东西，但进展似乎很强劲。</p><p>  Meanwhile, the other thing Discord has had to figure out is how to make money. This is a significantly less urgent problem: The company has raised nearly $400 million, including $100 million this past summer that valued the company at $3.5 billion. 	 Forbes estimated its revenue at over $120 million this year. Point is, Discord has plenty of runway. But there&#39;s not often a clean exit path for a huge communications platform with a spotty reputation for moderation (just ask Twitter and Reddit). Eventually, the company&#39;s going to have to make real money. And Citron and Vishnevskiy both adamantly say they don&#39;t want to sell ads or user data.</p><p>与此同时，不和谐必须解决的另一件事是如何赚钱。这是一个明显不那么紧迫的问题：该公司已经筹集了近4亿美元，其中包括去年夏天的1亿美元，当时该公司的估值为35亿美元。福布斯估计其今年的收入超过1.2亿美元。重点是“不和谐”有很多跑道。但是，对于一个声名狼藉的大型沟通平台来说，通常不会有一条干净的退出道路(只要问问Twitter和Reddit就知道了)。最终，该公司将不得不赚到真正的钱。雪铁龙和维什涅夫斯基都坚决表示，他们不想出售广告或用户数据。</p><p>  Users have long made businesses out of Discords. Mikeyy, for instance, eventually graduated from playing Overwatch to running  a big server for people who play FIFA, and particularly those who like to play its addictive Ultimate Team mode. Mikeyy and his team of moderators and admins run a VIP server inside the larger community, where for $13.99 a month they offer exclusive trading tips, guides and more. Everything runs through PayPal and similar services, though, and Discord doesn&#39;t see a dime. Over the last couple of years, Discord has become a place where lots of streamers, influencers and others chat more directly with their fans — Discord has official integrations with Twitch, Patreon and more — but it doesn&#39;t get a cut there either.</p><p>长期以来，用户一直在利用不和谐来做生意。例如，Mikeyy最终从玩Overwatch升级到为玩FIFA的人运营一个大型服务器，特别是那些喜欢玩其令人上瘾的终极团队模式的人。Mikeyy和他的版主和管理员团队在更大的社区内运营着一台VIP服务器，每月13.99美元，他们提供独家交易提示、指南等。不过，所有服务都是通过贝宝(PayPal)和类似的服务运行的，而不和谐并没有看到一分钱。在过去的几年里，“不和谐”已经成为许多流媒体用户、有影响力的人和其他人更直接地与粉丝聊天的地方--“不和谐”与Twitch、Patreon等网站进行了官方整合--但它在那里也没有分得一杯羹。</p><p> So far, Discord&#39;s main source of income has been Nitro, its $10-a-month premium service that lets users change their username, use more emoji and get both video and voice in slightly higher quality. But Discord always had bigger plans. One plan seemed obvious: Sell games to gamers! In 2018 Discord launched the Discord Store, with a hand-selected set of games available for purchase. Done with beating TeamSpeak and Skype, Discord was coming for Steam. Except that didn&#39;t work. Users didn&#39;t come to Discord to find games, they came to hang out with their friends. The Store only lasted a few months, and Nitro Games, a Netflix-for-games service that sounds a lot like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now, didn&#39;t last much longer.</p><p>到目前为止，不和谐的主要收入来源是Nitro，这是其每月10美元的高级服务，允许用户更改用户名，使用更多表情符号，并获得略高质量的视频和语音。但“不和谐”总是有更大的计划。一个计划似乎很明显：向游戏玩家销售游戏！2018年，Discorde推出了Discorde Store，提供了一套手工选择的游戏可供购买。在击败TeamSak和Skype之后，不和就要来找Steam了。但那并没有奏效。用户并不是为了寻找游戏而不欢而散，他们是来和朋友们一起玩的。这家商店只开了几个月，而Netflix的游戏服务Nitro Games，听起来很像现在的Xbox Game Pass和PlayStation，并没有持续很长时间。</p><p>  The Discord Store&#39;s failure was an eye-opening moment within Discord. And it caused another pivot: Discord had to be less about video games and more about becoming the place for people to hang out with their friends. It was now in the era of Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox and so many other games where being together was far more important than the activity on the screen.</p><p>不和谐商店的失败是不和谐中的一个令人大开眼界的时刻。它还引发了另一个转折点：不和谐不应该是关于视频游戏的，而是更多地是关于成为人们与朋友一起出去玩的地方。这是在堡垒之夜、“我的世界”、“罗伯克斯”和其他许多游戏的时代，在这些游戏中，在一起要比屏幕上的活动重要得多。</p><p>  People had used Discord for non-gaming things from the early days of the service — as many as 30% of servers were about something else — but the team had never paid them much attention. Starting last year, they did. They ran focus groups and user studies, trying to figure out how millions of people were using Discord. One question they asked was, &#34;What&#39;s the biggest misconception about Discord?&#34; The overwhelming answer: &#34;It&#39;s for gamers.&#34; People who wanted to have their study group/knitting club/origami lessons/sneaker-shopping crew in Discord were having trouble getting others hooked into this kooky app with the alien logo and all the in-jokes about TeamSpeak.</p><p>从这项服务的早期开始，人们就将不和谐用于非游戏的事情-多达30%的服务器是关于其他事情的-但团队从未给予他们太多关注。从去年开始，他们就这么做了。他们开展了焦点小组和用户研究，试图找出数百万人是如何使用不和谐的。他们提出的一个问题是，对“不和谐”最大的误解是什么？压倒性的答案是：这是为游戏玩家准备的。那些想让他们的学习小组/编织俱乐部/折纸课程/运动鞋购物团队不和谐的人，很难让其他人被这个带有外星人标志和所有关于TeamSak的笑话的古怪应用吸引过来。</p><p> In early 2020, as Discord was embarking on a big redesign and rebranding exercise designed to help it appeal more broadly, COVID happened. Suddenly, stuck at home, everyone&#39;s social life turned to the internet. Discord&#39;s user numbers increased by 47% from February to July, and all those newbies discovered what millions of gamers already knew: that having a place to hang out with their friends is a powerful thing, and that Discord did it better than anyone. Study groups started using Discord; teachers used it for class; friends used it to hang the way they normally would after school or on the weekend.</p><p>2020年初，当不和谐集团开始进行大规模的重新设计和品牌重塑活动，以帮助其更广泛地吸引人时，COVID发生了。突然，困在家里的每个人的社交生活都转向了互联网。从2月到7月，Discorde的用户数量增长了47%，所有这些新手都发现了数百万游戏玩家已经知道的事情：有一个和朋友一起出去玩的地方是一件很棒的事情，而Discord比任何人都做得更好。学习小组开始使用不和谐；老师用它上课；朋友们在放学后或周末用它像往常一样挂起来。</p><p>  At the end of June, Discord&#39;s rebrand was complete. Its new tagline was &#34;Your place to talk,&#34; and its homepage was mostly free of gaming jargon or confusing instructions. (Though the nods to gaming do persist, from the controller-alien logo to the .gg at the end of every Discord server&#39;s URL.) &#34;As we look back at the last few months,&#34; Citron and Vishnevskiy wrote in 	 a blog post announcing the redesign, &#34;it&#39;s clear that as people spend more and more time online, they want online spaces where they can find real humanity and belonging.&#34;</p><p>6月底，迪斯科重塑品牌的工作已经完成。它的新口号是“你说话的地方”，它的主页几乎没有游戏。</p><p> In the months and years to come, Discord has plenty of work to do, particularly on continuing to improve moderation tools and make sure the communities on its platform operate the way the company hopes</p><p>在未来的几个月和几年里，不和谐有很多工作要做，特别是在继续改进适度工具和确保其平台上的社区按照公司希望的方式运行方面。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div
