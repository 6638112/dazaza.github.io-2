"note_en": "Judd Rubin:\u00a0 Three continents, one conversation, this is Asymetric. We are very excited to have Balaji Srinivasan with us today. Balaji, you\u2019re a busy man, Horace you\u2019re on the run as usual, so why don\u2019t we dive right in. Thanks for joining us today.\n   Balaji: I know you from online, from Twitter, or at least, I know of your work. It\u2019s always interesting for people to understand how they\u2019re maybe thought of by folks who are maybe a little bit on the periphery. And I, we\u2019ve, always thought of you as the most quantitative Apple analyst, I guess you and [John] Gruber would be the two people who, if you\u2019re in the Apple ecosystem, might be the most perceptive commentators outside of Apple itself.\n  Balaji: Yeah, exactly. And I\u2019m not like a huge, I mean, it\u2019s funny, certainly I have a lot of Apple equipment, but I wouldn\u2019t consider myself an Apple fanboy, per se. I converted to Apple when they supported BSD in OSX, because it was a better compute experience.\n And, for the last, almost 20 years, the typical developer/engineer/founder, whatever, set up has been a Mac laptop locally, and then all your compute is on AWS or a Linux box or something in the cloud.\n Horace: Yeah, me too, actually, because when I started my university work, it was all on Unix, and this was in the days of VAX computers, Digital Equipment, and I just loved that interface at the time of DOS. This felt like, you know, ages ahead. And then I moved from a console to a workstation, which would have been a large screen using the X windowing system and that was my career for five years.\n I wasn\u2019t even on a PC anymore, I wasn\u2019t using a Mac, but in 2000 when they switched, roughly around that time they switched to being, like you said, BSD. And I was like, okay, Mac is the way to go. Anyway, we don\u2019t want to talk about necessarily Apple, tell us what you\u2019re working on these days.\n Balaji: Sure. I\u2019ve actually got the crypto plan for world domination that I thought I might discuss with you. Which is essentially how if you\u2019re a crypto maximalist, so to speak, how I think crypto is the most important threat to the Big Five.\n And essentially the plan for the next decade for how crypto goes after, not just FinTech, but Messaging, Log-in, Social, Search; Crypto Phone, Crypto OS, compilers, databases, advertising, actually reinventing CPA (cost per action), hosting, data centers, creator monetization, and then, on the back end, equity, compensation, privacy, and then most importantly: values.\n I actually think that people are underestimating the scope of how big of a deal crypto is and that the Big Five don\u2019t really get it. The Big Five, meaning, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft.\n And there\u2019s pieces of their empires that I haven\u2019t yet figured out how crypto might disrupt. Amazon\u2019s physical logistics, for example, but there\u2019s much more of it that is crypto vulnerable than I think people think. And your audience might be interested in this. Some of this is new, even, for maybe my audience.\n  Horace: Yeah, the one thing I would caution on, is this usage of the word disruption, because I\u2019m also a student of Clay Christensen. To what extent what I challenge you to answer is, to what extent might these Big Five find [crypto], possibly sustaining?\n So if they would say, \u2018Oh, well, thank you very much. We\u2019ll take it from here.\u2019 So, I agree that there\u2019s an opportunity here to disrupt, but many times people just assume change is always disruptive, but change can be sustaining as well. So, please tell us.\n Balaji: So, actually, on that point, there\u2019s a colloquial usage of disrupt, which just means a change. And then there\u2019s the more technical, the Clayton Christensen version, which is, it starts out as sort of an inferior product in some ways, but it\u2019s 10x on one axis, it\u2019s sort of underestimated. And then it takes the bottom end of the market, and then zooms up to the top in such a way that the incumbent finds it difficult to adopt it because it attacks their margins and so on.\n  Horace: That\u2019s what I mean, yes. That\u2019s low end disruption. There\u2019s also new markets where it basically carves out for itself a new niche and it does things that nobody\u2019s asked it to do. Or markets that are non-consuming, like, you know, emerging markets or something like that, and grows from that base as opposed to low end.\n  Balaji: Yeah, so I think that this fits, as I\u2019ll go through each of these examples, I think each of these fit both the sort of colloquial usage, as well as the more technical usage. But let me go one by one and just talk through these points.\n So first, at a high level, I\u2019m actually pretty confident that, with the exception actually of Facebook and Twitter, I think crypto is kryptonite to large companies because they don\u2019t understand it. And in particular, they\u2019re sort of frozen by antitrust and they can\u2019t take on more regulatory risk, even if they had the personalities internally to do so. I actually give a lot of credit, even if I think Libra was misguided in some respects, in terms of implementation, I give a lot of credit to [Mark Zuckerberg] for trying to get into crypto relatively early and putting out a project. Even if, in many respects, I think the parameters were flipped, as I can get into, to simply push through that relatively early, starting in 2018, when the other companies didn\u2019t get there is because he has a founder\u2019s mentality still.\n And I think Twitter is actually the dark horse here where it\u2019s the furthest ahead on Bitcoin, specifically, as opposed to crypto more generally, that\u2019s an internal distinction in the community that I can talk about. But I don\u2019t think that Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon actually get it because they\u2019re not founder led.\n  Horace: By the way, just a funny story. So I\u2019m here in Germany because I\u2019m at an event for e-bikes called Eurobike, or just bikes in general. So I\u2019m a fan of Micromobility, I\u2019ve been talking about it for a couple of years now. I get the same impression. I\u2019ve spoken to people at those companies that they\u2019re not seeing it, they\u2019re not feeling it. Their entire mobility focus is still automotive. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s a cognitive problem. They understand the idea, but they can\u2019t actually implement it, it\u2019s this innovator\u2019s dilemma thing.\n Balaji: Yeah. I mean, it gets to the fundamental thing, right? Which is that a founder is able to say, \u2018Hey, we were doing X for such a long time and X got us to where we are, but now we\u2019re doing, not X. We\u2019re doing the opposite of that.\u2019\n And they have the credibility to turn the entire organization, in particular, to impose short-term costs for long-term benefit to cannibalize or disrupt, in the colloquial sense, an existing product for a new one.\n You know, Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is actually the exception. I would put him, if I rank order the existing companies by their crypto friendliness\u2026\n What\u2019s interesting is it\u2019s the $100 billion and $10 billion and $1 billon companies that are much more crypto friendly than the trillion-dollar companies.\n So Shopify, for example, gets it, right? Coinbase. Stripe, I think, is coming around. So the ones that are sort of like the sophomores or the juniors, as opposed to the seniors, are going to, I think, use this to slip stream. And I think this is a disruption again, you know, I know you\u2019re from the Christensen club, so I may use that colloquially, so poke at it.\n I think this is a change or an alteration or a forcing function, whatever you want to call it. That is actually on par with the desktop to internet transition. That you can think of this as, just like you went from on disk to online, the transition from online to on chain involves a similar number of cultural and technical changes that render the current generation, basically like the Borlands and DEC Alphas and so on of the previous generation.\n Horace: So tell us how do you think that\u2026 You gave a lot of examples, of things going on chain \u2014\n Balaji: Yeah, so let\u2019s go to specifics. Let\u2019s start with the obvious, which is FinTech. One of my colleagues, friends, Chris Dixon runs the crypto fund at a16z. He observed a while ago that many Unix command lines became apps.\n For example, GIT became GitHub. That\u2019s an obvious one, but had these command line chat apps that effectively became Facebook and IRC and Slack and so on and so forth, right? Command line apps turned into full-blown UXs. Crypto is actually the reverse in some ways where every FinTech app can be turned into a crypto command line. For example, Affirm or PayPal or Funbox, or, many of these things that essentially are doing cashflow transformations of some kind can be written as a few lines of code in Solidity. Which is Ethereum\u2019s programming language. And that alone is actually kind of a big deal where you can write that down and then just start piping arbitrary amounts of money through it, between countries, where it really is the internet of money. Any user can route money to any other user, if both users have a crypto address, if they have a Bitcoin address or an Ethereum address for the purpose of smart contracts.\n And so that\u2019s just a fundamental backend change. And one way of thinking about it is over the last 10 years, since the financial crisis, Dodd-Frank basically stopped the issuance of new banking charters. Were you familiar with that? Did you ever see the graph of that?\n  Balaji: So, you\u2019re a graph guy \u2013 I\u2019ve got a chart on this somewhere on Twitter, but basically the way that they dealt with the banks\u2019 failure during the financial crisis is to effectively reward them by eliminating their competition entirely by refusing to issue new bank charters for almost a decade. And, here\u2019s the graph over here.\n  The state\u2019s solution to the financial crisis was to stop issuing commercial bank charters for almost a decade and to reward failure by regulating away competition via Dodd-Frank.\n  The reason I bring this up is FinTech is a front end, Blockchain is a backend. Over the last 10 years\u2026 You\u2019re probably familiar, at least to some extent, with the FinTech side of things. Imagine if, when I sent you a message via Gmail, that behind the scenes, Google printed out the email, put it on a Pony Express, took it to you cross continent, scanned that and put that into your inbox.\n And it looked like it was digital, but it actually had this antiquated pre-internet backend of a two or three-day delay in there, but the company did the best it could to obscure that. You know, all of those hacky steps in between, yeah? That\u2019s a good analogy for what FinTech is, where it\u2019s this shiny web-like front end, but on the back end, you\u2019re dealing with pre-internet mechanisms for settlement where it\u2019s often FTP or flat files or some horrible Cobol-era file format. It just wasn\u2019t set up for the workloads that we have when you actually press on that. Right? Once you set it up and you give people the expectations of being as performant as a Facebook or a Twitter or a Gmail, and you start putting huge workloads through \u2013 that the financial system doesn\u2019t anticipate, you get things like the Robin Hood issue of earlier this year.\n  Balaji: Right? You make people think that it can handle internet-like workloads. But it can\u2019t, it just kind of simulated that. Taking that Gmail analogy a little bit further, with Gmail, every email that I send you is basically non-fungible. In the sense that each one is just a different set of characters. But if it was fungible, if it was money where every dollar is the same as every other dollar, Google could\u2026 when I hit a button to send you a hundred bucks, Google could just extend you effectively a hundred bucks on credit where it\u2019s assuming I\u2019m good for the hundred bucks. Right?\n And that is essentially the mechanism by which a lot of FinTech companies operate where they\u2019re like a central buffer that makes users think that this stuff is instant and fast, but it\u2019s actually not on the backend. Okay, so FinTech is a front end. Blockchain\u2019s a backend, where it\u2019s a genuine innovation.\n So it\u2019s almost like this flanking thing where bank charters were cut off. FinTech built all of these fancy front ends on top of banks by doing deals with banks, by now, more recently starting to get licenses in Utah and places like that. And then blockchain, the crypto space, built a completely different set of rails where they essentially, over 10 years, got people to accept these things as money-like.\n And now they\u2019re coming together where, with Robin Hood, with Square, most FinTech companies are aware that crypto is a big deal. It\u2019s not going away. And the reason many of them have a hard time getting their head around it is that it flips basic assumptions.\n What Satoshi did with Bitcoin is he flipped absolutely basic assumptions. Where the concept of Bitcoin starts with the idea that deflation is actually good if it\u2019s coming from productivity. The typical macroeconomist would say hyperinflation is bad, but deflation is also bad. A little bit of mild inflation is good. This is what you\u2019ll read in every Econ 101 textbook.\n   You want to have users be able to hold their own funds and you want to have a fixed monetary policy that gives certainty for investing in the future. That can\u2019t be monkeyed around with, by the Fed open markets committee, to bail out banks and stop transactions and so on. That meant so many flips of fundamental premises.\n Number one, digital gold being good rather than bad. Number two, that users should be able to custody their own money rather than having it at banks and they should be able to take that risk. Number three, that transactions by default should all be able to go through. So it\u2019s like a default approved as opposed to a default sanctioned and so on and so forth. They basically just flipped fundamental premises.\n And when you flip fundamental premises, you can often get to just a completely different environment, completely different worldview, completely different set of solutions. I mean, it\u2019s like land animals versus sea animals or like Google\u2019s culture versus Apple\u2019s culture, right?\n I mean, now they\u2019ve become more similar but Apple for a long time, it used to be very private internally and Google was very public internally. Both of them worked on their own terms, but were just fundamentally different in terms of their premises and axioms.\n Horace: Let me get back to this example you gave us, of online as a way to do fundamental transactions. Now, one of the things that, and this seems very much, like you said, behind the scenes, because from the front end the consumer is given an illusion of technical competence. But in the backend, it\u2019s actually still jury rigged.\n Now, the thing that I would ask is what does that mean and how does it feel different for the consumer? Because if you fix the backend, then yes, it\u2019s much more robust and clean and probably safer. But I think that the way it affects behavior is not so much that people feel different about that interface, but rather that they will do more of it.\n In other words, that, like you said, it was about volumes that caused the cracks to appear in Robin Hood. So to me, the question, the reason, let\u2019s say I\u2019m not skeptical, but I\u2019m slightly reluctant to dive headfirst in on crypto is that I\u2019m asking all the time is: How does it feel different for the end user?\n And the end user would have to have some sort of emotional response to this change and say, \u2018Wow, this is really amazing! Now it\u2019s much better.\u2019 Or, \u2018Now I can do things that I couldn\u2019t do before.\u2019 So what I would posit is that the change you speak of would allow the users to suddenly say, \u2018You know, I may do a wire to pay for a very large sum, but now I would do it a hundred times a day. Or I would do it to pay my friend, or I would do something financially that I never did before.\u2019\n And I, by the way, I feel this pain a lot because I live in two countries and you probably do as well, and you have to always transfer money and it\u2019s an absolute nightmare. And it\u2019s almost confiscatory in the way they steal money on the way, to try to transfer funds internationally.\n So do you see this driving new user behavior or is it simply that you fixed something that was broken?\n Balaji: Absolutely, excellent question. Let me give a few points on that. An interesting thing Evan Williams once said, in a sort of counter-intuitive way, was that the way to get people to adopt an app is to not do something totally different, but to take something they\u2019re already doing and just cut out steps. Make it just faster, simpler, etc.\n You know, people were blogging and then they did Twitter. People were blogging and then they did Medium and made it simpler, with front end editing. And that\u2019s one view, that technology is incremental. But the other view is it\u2019s transformative. Wait a second \u2013 our lives are so different than the past.\n And here\u2019s how I reconcile those, then let me get to specifics. If you go from physical mail to email, just sending point to point email, to a group email with reply all. To a group email with reply all where you add attachments of images to a Facebook thread, to then real-time chat in something like Slack or Discord where you\u2019re attaching images.\n Each one is an incremental step over the previous one. But if you were to think about how expensive it would be to do a Facebook thread by physical mail. You\u2019d have, I don\u2019t know, a thousand friends and you\u2019d be printing out the thread each time and sending postcards to each of them, with someone saying LOL\u2026\n If you would just diagram that out and see how many packets were moving back and forth between those thousand participants of which maybe 95, 99% of them are, actually, not even participating. So therefore they wouldn\u2019t even go and send in their postcards. And you\u2019d say how much of a cost that would be on the legacy postal system?\n At a certain point, when it\u2019s a million postcards to be one simple Facebook thread that we take for granted that has some images and a reply and maybe a link or something like that. Well, then the quantitative difference makes a qualitative difference.\n  Balaji: Right? And in the same way, that\u2019s basically what\u2019s happening with crypto. And one way of thinking about it is \u2013 and this is now changing, but in the first 10 years, what crypto was best for and by the way, within crypto the term \u2018crypto\u2019 is an overarching thing that encompasses\u2026 There\u2019s just different people who have a beef with the term. One group, are those people for whom, you know, crypto used to mean cryptography, right?\n And the second are those folks who think of Bitcoin as its own area, as distinct from crypto in general. I think crypto is the right term for the space as a whole. I think, in particular, cryptocurrency and blockchain is to cryptography roughly as the internet is to software. Software is not synonymous with the internet. Computer science is not synonymous with the internet, but it\u2019s certainly the most frequent deployment and monetization point for it. And, in the same way, I think many cryptographic concepts will be deployed and monetize within the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.\n On the second thing, just to finish this little tangent for a second, Bitcoin people think of Bitcoin as the only real cryptocurrency and everything else is a scam and a fraud and blah, blah, blah.\n Which I don\u2019t believe. And I don\u2019t think Satoshi Nakamoto believed that, but this is something you\u2019ll probably hear more and more of.\n But just in terms of that term, \u2018crypto\u2019 is basically thinking of the space as a financial and technological and efficiency related movement. There\u2019s also a very strong overlap, which I\u2019ll get to on the ethical aspects and how it\u2019s actually a pro-freedom movement. And those overlap. And a Bitcoin maximalist would be like purely on the pro-freedom side, or in their mental model of it.\n Okay. Just coming back up the stack. So, end-user benefit basically in the first 10 years, crypto benefited what I\u2019d call\n......", "posttime": "2022-01-11 10:23:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7edf\u6cbb,plan,\u8ba4\u4e3a", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u7edf\u6cbb\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8ba1\u5212", "title_en": "The crypto plan for world domination", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.asymco.com/2022/01/10/asymetric-the-crypto-plan-for-world-domination-an-interview-with-balaji-srinivasan/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7edf\u6cbb", "plan", "\u8ba4\u4e3a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2b24e4e401a28866fa6c0442c3f51755.jpg", "infoid": 1072705, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u67e5\u770b\u53cd\u5bf9\u4fee\u590d\u6743\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u5e9f\u8bdd\u4e89\u8bba\uff0c\u5728Odysee\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u610f\u4e49", "note_en": "View Six bullshit arguments against right to repair that make no sense on Odysee", "posttime": "2022-01-11 10:15:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8bba\u636e,arguments", "title": "\u53cd\u5bf9\u4fee\u590d\u6743\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u5e9f\u8bdd\u8bba\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u610f\u4e49", "title_en": "Six bullshit arguments against right to repair that make no sense", "transed": 1, "url": "https://odysee.com/@CyberLounge:a/six-bullshit-arguments-against-right-to-repair:8", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bba\u636e", "arguments"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "32f93ee95c5042cdb8fe348807f727c1.jpeg", "infoid": 1072704, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60f3\u8c61\u732a\u4e0e\u4eba\u4f53\u5fc3\u810f\u6216\u5c0f\u9f20\u7684\u8111\u5b50\u6709\u8111\u5b50\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u6167\u7684\u706b\u82b1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u7ec6\u80de\u6ce8\u5165\u5c0f\u9f20\uff0c\u5927\u9f20\uff0c\u732a\u548c\u5976\u725b\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u57f9\u517b\u4e00\u7fa4\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5408\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u521b\u4f5c\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u5929\u7528\u4e8e\u79cd\u690d\u4eba\u4f53\u5668\u5b98\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u690d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u75be\u75c5\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b0\u836f\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Imagine pigs with human hearts or mice whose brains have a spark of human intelligence.

For those of you sad that it\u2019s winter, or  bummed that bitcoin took hits today, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don\u2019t frown; it\u2019s going to be OK! \u2013  Alex\n  Y Combinator boosts investment terms: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it\u2019s your move.\n Take-Two buys Zynga: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two\u2019s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.\n Career Karma lands $40M: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the \u201cworld\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own  Natasha Mascarenhas has the story.\n  Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I  want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market. In short, we\u2019re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.\n  Who watches the watchers? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!\n Gameto is taking on menopause: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to \u201csolve the problem of \u2018accelerated\u2019 ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women\u2019s health and equality,\u201d Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it\u2019s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.\n Parrot wants to help Mexico\u2019s restaurants thrive in the delivery era: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to \u201cdigitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,\u201d we write.\n Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That\u2019s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.\n ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash \u2013 a great startup name \u2013 raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.\n Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup \u201coperates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,\u201d we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.\n   If you\u2019ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s so much interest in lab-grown meat.\n Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience. With consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.\n In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+, reporter Christine Hall examines the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identifies many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with related challenges regarding production, cost and consumer interest.\n  (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

The action is  in the word. Stop means, well, stop? And yet. Today news is out that Tesla\u2019s \u201cAssertive\u201d driving mode for the car company\u2019s self-driving car \u201cmay perform rolling stops\u201d among other more aggressive actions. Alas.\n   Are you all caught up on last week\u2019s coverage of growth marketing and software development?

For those of you sad that it\u2019s winter, or  bummed that bitcoin took hits today, take heart. We have lots of neat news for you today, including the evolution of lab-grown meat, a mega-acquisition in the gaming space, and even some good news for startups hoping to land an accelerator spot! Don\u2019t frown; it\u2019s going to be OK! \u2013  Alex\n  Y Combinator boosts investment terms: Gone are the days when seed-stage startups raise $37 and fuel themselves with ramen. With Big Tech salaries scaling into the stratosphere, the startup game is a different sort of wager than it once was, given that there are more pathways to tech wealth than there were in decades past. Y Combinator is following the times, boosting its traditional check to startups in its accelerator by tacking on $375,000 in the form of a SAFE. Other accelerators, it\u2019s your move.\n Take-Two buys Zynga: Perhaps the biggest piece of business news in the tech world today not involving startups was the 11-figure deal that will see gaming company Take-Two buy Zynga. The latter company saw its share price skyrocket on the news, which will see it absorbed for a blend of stock and cash. Take-Two\u2019s stock, in contrast, fell around 13% on the announcement.\n Career Karma lands $40M: You might know Career Karma as a startup that helped folks find the right coding school for themselves. But the startup, now flush with a huge Series B, wants to become the \u201cworld\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d its CEO told TechCrunch. Our own  Natasha Mascarenhas has the story.\n  Before we jump into another crop of startup funding rounds, I  want to note a little bit of dissonance in the market. In short, we\u2019re seeing the public markets sell off tech shares, leading to falling multiples and a perhaps less attractive exit environment. On the other hand, the private market appears content to push startup prices higher and higher. Forcing the private and public markets to line up in time could be a painful exercise for startups that miss their growth targets.\n  Who watches the watchers? Our own Haje Jan Kamps wrote up a fascinating look at the world of corporate spyware. Your employer is probably watching what you are doing, and Haje has tips. Heck, Yahoo is probably watching me type this up. Hello, corporate overlords!\n Gameto is taking on menopause: Far from the world of enterprise SaaS, there is a universe of startups working on health. But not all of them are working on nootropics or the like. Gameto wants to \u201csolve the problem of \u2018accelerated\u2019 ovarian aging to change the trajectory of women\u2019s health and equality,\u201d Connie Loizos reports. The startup is still pretty young, but it\u2019s taking on a market that is, well, half the human population. One to keep an eye on.\n Parrot wants to help Mexico\u2019s restaurants thrive in the delivery era: The move to a more delivery-and-pickup world has forced restaurants around the world to adapt. But not every market has the same tooling options or local demands. Parrot just raised $9.5 million for its work to help restaurateurs in Mexico use its point-of-sale software to \u201cdigitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth,\u201d we write.\n Arive raises $20M to instantly deliver electronics: Imagine the so-called instant grocery delivery market, but swap out the foodstuffs for larger, more expensive goods like headphones and beauty products. That\u2019s what Arive wants to build, and it just raised $20 million for its work.\n ThankUCash raises $5.3M to bring loyalty programs to Africa: The African startup market continues its impressive run of funding events this week, with ThankUCash \u2013 a great startup name \u2013 raising new capital to help stores on the continent offer loyalty programs and payment services. For the many offline stores in Africa, the startup could prove to be a boon.\n Ankorstore raises epic $283M Series C: French startup Ankorstore is a unicorn in the wake of its recent huge fundraise. The startup \u201coperates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe,\u201d we noted today, which is proving to be a rapidly scalable enterprise.\n   If you\u2019ve ever seen a lagoon filled with hog waste or driven on I-5 past the cattle feedlots in Coalinga, California, it\u2019s easy to see why there\u2019s so much interest in lab-grown meat.\n Conventional factory farming practices cause widespread environmental damage, but industry and consumers have learned to live with in exchange for affordability and convenience. With consumption and population growth steadily increasing, one might even say meat is eating the world.\n In a deeply researched report for TechCrunch+, reporter Christine Hall examines the state of the cell-cultured meat industry and identifies many of the startups innovating in the sector, along with related challenges regarding production, cost and consumer interest.\n  (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

The action is  in the word. Stop means, well, stop? And yet. Today news is out that Tesla\u2019s \u201cAssertive\u201d driving mode for the car company\u2019s self-driving car \u201cmay perform rolling stops\u201d among other more aggressive actions.

But as Wired  reported last week, a \u201cmuch broader phase of that experiment has quietly been underway since mid-November. That\u2019s when Signal made the same feature accessible to all of its users without fanfare, offering the ability to send digital payments far more private than a credit card transaction\u2014or a Bitcoin transfer\u2014to many millions of phones.\u201d\n  MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard told the outlet that the rollout has spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, telling Wired that \u201cthere are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less.\u201d\n Notably, one needs to load one\u2019s wallet with the cryptocurrency first, and, as Wired notes, it is listed for sale on only a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges, including FTX, and none yet offer it to U.S. consumers. (FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is one of many investors in MobileCoin through his quantitative trading firm and cryptocurrency liquidity provider, Alameda Research.)\n Even Americans will have access to the currency shortly, however, Goldbard told Wired, pointing to recently signed agreements, including with the cryptocurrency payment processor  Zero Hash, that should allow U.S. residents buy MobileCoin within the first few months of this year.\n  In the meantime, going worldwide has been good for MobileCoin, which last summer raised $66 million in Series B funding at a $1.066 billion valuation and, according to sources close to the company, is in the process of raising a Series C round at a valuation that one source describes as \u201cin the high single-digit billions\u201d of dollars.\n MobileCoin\u2019s growth has also raised questions about Signal and about Marlinspike, who has seemingly tried to maintain some distance between himself and MobileCoin. One apparent reason why centers on Signal employees, some of who told reporter Casey Newton last year that they viewed Signal\u2019s exploration of cryptocurrency as  risky and an invitation for bad actors to use the platform.\n A potentially bigger, but related, concern of critics is that integrating a privacy coin could cause legal headaches for Signal. As Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, told Wired last week, \u201cI\u2019m very nervous they\u2019re going to get themselves into a problematic situation by flirting with this kind of payment infrastructure when there\u2019s so much legislation and regulation around it.\u201d\n It\u2019s a valid concern. As we\u2019ve  noted\u00a0 previously, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven\u2019t historically mixed well owing to nervous regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company. Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal \u2014 it claims more than 500 million monthly active users \u2014 similarly  abandoned plans to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC.\n Even Facebook hasn\u2019t been able to gain much traction with its own cryptocurrency project, with the longtime leader of that effort, David Marcus, announcing back in November that he was  leaving the company.\n If Marcus shows up at MobileCoin, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised, but we\u2019d be even less surprised to see Marlinspike get more involved in some capacity.\n Neither Goldbard nor Marlinspike have responded to our requests today for more information, but asked if Marlinspike might consider taking over MobileCoin as CEO (the company doesn\u2019t have one), a source close to him says he is \u201cnot doing that\u201d and right now is just \u201ctaking a break.\u201d\n We\u2019ll see. We aren\u2019t promising to eat our shoes if we\u2019re wrong. (It happens!)\n For now, Marlinspike writes in his post, he will remain on Signal\u2019s board while Signal\u2019s search for a new CEO continues. Its executive chair, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, will serve as Signal\u2019s interim CEO in the meantime.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 09:27:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "marlinspike,mobilecoin", "title": "Moxie Marlinspike\u6b63\u5728\u7559\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7;\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6000\u7591\u4ed6\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMoxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal; here\u2019s where we suspect he\u2019s headed and why\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/", "via": "", "real_tags": []}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5d7889e5c48566b3b4ab981b683a2f6d.jpeg", "infoid": 1072700, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\uff0cRIVIAN\u57282021\u5e74\u5e95\u6c47\u51fa\u4e86920\u8f86\u8f66\u3002\u6839\u636e\u517612\u6708\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\uff0cRIVIAN\u6709\u8d85\u8fc771,000\u201c\u9884\u8ba2\u201d\uff08\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53ef\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\uff08\u5373\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\u3002\n\u572812\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u547c\u53eb\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e24\u6b21\u63d0\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u5f26\u4e50\u961f\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u6807\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6307\u51fa\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u201c\u4e3b\u8981\u6309\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u201d\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3aRIVIAN\u53c2\u52a0\u5761\u9053\u7684\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u901a\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u798f\u7279\u6b63\u5728\u51c6\u5907\u542f\u52a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u3002\u798f\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c1\u67084\u65e5\u5c06\u57282023\u5e74\u4e2d\u671f\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u7535\u52a8F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f2023\u5e74\u768415\u4e07\u8f86\u3002 F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9884\u8ba1\u57282022\u5e74\u6625\u5b63\u3002", "note_en": "Rivian delivered 920 vehicles by the end of 2021, according to a release issued Monday. Rivian has more than 71,000 \u201cpre-orders\u201d (meaning refundable reservations) for its R1T pickup trucks, according to its  letter to shareholders posted in December.\n Rivian had initially targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by the end of the year. Last month, company executives including CEO RJ Scaringe cut those expectations, saying it would likely fall a few hundred vehicles short due to supply chain issues and challenges of battery production.\n  During its earnings call in December, Scaringe referred to production as a complex orchestra on two occasions.\n \u201cIn ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra,\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cSo you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.\u201d\n Despite that lowered target, Scaringe noted during that call that the company is \u201cramping largely as expected.\u201d\n \u201cThe battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line,\u201d he said in December. \u201cAnd as I said, that doesn\u2019t represent any long-term challenges for us.

Last year,  Porsche launched two new e-bikes that were designed with the spirit of the Taycan Cross Turismo. BMW has also released plans to produce  several e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles lately, as well, like its  all-electric CE 04 scooter.\n  Last month, Rivian shared plans to use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it went public to  build a second factory in Georgia (its first is in Illinois) to double its production capacity and produce battery cells \u2013 cells which can ostensibly be used in batteries for other types of vehicles, as well.\n According to the filing, which was first revealed by  Rivian Forums, Rivian wants to expand the use of its trademark to include the following:\n Bicycles; bicycle structural parts; electric bicycles; electric bicycle structural parts; electric bicycle components specially adapted for electric bicycles, namely, battery packs, motor controllers, electric motors, throttle controls, pedal assist sensors, display consoles, wiring harnesses, sprockets, cassettes, chains; bicycle frames; bicycle pedals; bicycle horns; bicycle brakes; bicycle chains; bicycle gears; bicycle wheels; bicycle seats; bicycle tires; bicycle cranks; bicycle tags; bicycle mudguards; bicycle motors; bicycle saddles; bicycle pumps; bicycle bells; bicycle handlebars; bicycle trailers; bicycle kickstands; bicycle seat posts; fitted bicycle covers; bicycle wheel spokes; bicycle wheel rims; bicycle stands; bicycle pedal straps; bicycle parts, namely, derailleurs; bicycle water bottle cages; bicycle carriers for vehicles; pumps for bicycle tires; inner tubes for bicycle tires; bicycle parts, namely disk wheels; bicycle parts, namely brake shoes\n Rivian also recently filed a patent for an  integrated tailgate cargo system for automotive vehicle, which is essentially a tailgate bike rack that will allow drivers to carry a bike in their pickup without losing bed space.

I\u2019ve been programming since I was 11 years old, my first language was Lua. Since I started at a relatively young age it was never \u2018work\u2019 for me, It was more like a fun hobby with which I could express myself and create things (mostly games).\n  I got super into admin commands when I was 13 though, ignore the repeated table index. I was 13\u2026\n I never forced myself to \u2018work\u2019 really, it was just something I really enjoyed doing. It ended up becoming a daily thing where after school I would blow off my homework (to my mother\u2019s dismay) and spend hours making various games and scripts. This naturally become a problem when in late highschool I began to hate working on projects, jumping from project to project and never finishing anything. This eventually forced me to become a bit more organized in how I be productive.\n So, here\u2019s some tips I\u2019ve found that were helpful for staying productive and not resenting your projects in no particular order.\n  Seriously, write down what you hope to accomplish today. Make sure to be realistic in what you have time for, if your goal is to \u2018write a compiler\u2019 break it down into small steps. For that day, you could say your goal is to \u2018start tokenizer, implement basic tokens.\u2019 For an example, this is my day\u2019s plan:\n - Finish burnout journal entry - Implement basic constant support for pyuxncle - Call Cameron and ask about his day\n It\u2019s also nice to have some non-work related goals, like calling a friend or your significant other. This keeps you not entirely work-focused.\n  If your plan is to do something small on a project, don\u2019t work past that point! This keeps your mind focused on finishing the task you had planed and keeps you interested in your project! Overworking on a project has lead me to burnout countless times. If you keep a small steady pace, you will keep your enjoyment on the project for much longer.\n  If you\u2019re stumped when trying to plan out your day, take a break! It is completely fine to be unproductive! If you\u2019ve found that you\u2019re no longer motivated to work on your project, find another way to have a feeling of accomplishment for that day. Take a walk, read a book at a coffee shop, go hang with friends, anything you feel that would make you feel fulfilled for the day.\n Of course, these tips may not help if you\u2019re a wageslave and your job is to write code. But these are self-learned lessons that have helped me, and no one\u2019s situation is the same. Find what works for you and stick with it. Having a routine is probably the most important part.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 08:30:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7167\u987e,care", "title": "\u5026\u6020\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u7167\u987e\u548c\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548", "title_en": "Burnout, self-care and being productive", "transed": 1, "url": "https://openpunk.com/journal/burnout/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7167\u987e", "care"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072693, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f - \u8bc1\u5238\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6b63\u51c6\u5907\u8feb\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u79c1\u8425\u516c\u53f8\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5d1b\u8d77\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u7b79\u8d44\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to force more transparency from big private companies, as regulators grow concerned about the lack of oversight of the private fundraising that has fueled their rise.\n  Private capital markets have become an  increasingly popular way for companies to raise money in the U.S. in recent decades, allowing firms to acquire funding from institutions and wealthy individuals without the regulatory burdens of going public.
