Three recent books disagree energetically. “Crows and parrots perform as well as dogs in tests of reasoning and learning,” David Sibley writes in  What It’s Like to Be a Bird. Jennifer Ackerman reports in  The Bird Way that New Caledonian crows can assemble compound tools out of more than one element; children cannot do this until at least the age of five, she writes. Sibley describes an experiment in which ravens retrieved a piece of food floating halfway down a glass tube by dropping small stones into the tube until the water raised it to the top. He thought these birds had the problem-solving ability of a five-to-seven-year-old child. Sibley, previously known for guides to bird identification, came to believe while writing  What It’s Like to Be a Bird that “a bird’s experience is far richer, more complex, and more ‘thoughtful’ than I’d imagined…. Birds are making decisions all the time.”</p><p>“伯尔伯恩”，“傻鹅”，“傻瓜像渡渡鸟”这些词反映了一种普遍的观点，即鸟类（也许不是猫头鹰）不是很聪明。最近的三本书在能量上存在分歧。 “在推理和学习测试中，乌鸦和鹦鹉的表现与狗一样好，”戴维·西布利（David Sibley）在《像一只鸟一样》中写道。詹妮弗·阿克曼（Jennifer Ackerman）在《鸟类之路》（The Bird Way）中报道，新喀里多尼亚乌鸦可以用多种元素来组装复合工具。她写道，孩子们至少要到五岁才能这样做。 Sibley描述了一个实验，在该实验中，乌鸦取了一块漂浮在玻璃管中途的食物，方法是将小石头掉入玻璃管中，直到水将其升到顶部。他认为这些鸟具有解决五到七岁孩子问题的能力。以前以鸟类识别指南而闻名的Sibley在写《鸟的感觉》时就相信，“鸟类的经历比我想象的要丰富，复杂和多”。”鸟类一直在做决定。”</p><p> Although Ackerman is a science writer, not a professional scientist, she has extensively surveyed the scholarly literature about bird cognition in  The Genius of Birds (2016) and now in  The Bird Way. She is particularly interested in the structure and functioning of the avian brain, and in experiments that reveal how birds use experience, reasoning, and memory in decision-making.</p><p> 尽管阿克曼（Ackerman）是科学作家，而不是专业科学家，但她已广泛调查了《鸟类的天才》（2016）和《鸟类之路》中有关鸟类认知的学术文献。她对禽脑的结构和功能以及揭示鸟类如何在决策中使用经验，推理和记忆的实验特别感兴趣。</p><p> A generation ago the pioneers of research into bird behavior assumed that it was largely innate. The Dutch-born Oxford biologist and ornithologist Nikolaas Tinbergen shared a Nobel Prize in 1973 for his work on animal behavior and communication, in the course of which he discovered that infant herring gulls get their parents to feed them by pecking at a red spot on the adult’s yellow bill. His co-winner Konrad Lorenz studied the phenomenon of imprinting: an infant animal becomes attached to the first thing it sees, which is normally its mother, and thus associates with its own kind. The geese that Lorenz raised personally were imprinted on him and followed him around his Austrian estate.</p><p> 一代人以前，鸟类行为研究的先驱者认为它很大程度上是与生俱来的。荷兰出生的牛津生物学家和鸟类学家尼古拉斯·廷伯根（Nikolaas Tinbergen）因其在动物行为和交流方面的工作而于1973年获得了诺贝尔奖，在此过程中，他发现婴儿鲱鸥在其红色斑点上啄食，从而使父母为它们喂食。成人的黄帐单。他的共同获奖者康拉德·洛伦兹（Konrad Lorenz）研究了烙印现象：一种婴儿被附着在它所看到的第一件事上，通常是它的母亲，因此与它的同类联系在一起。洛伦茨亲自抚养的鹅被印在他身上，并跟随他在他的奥地利庄园中游荡。</p><p> Today, Ackerman reports, research into bird behavior has swung strongly toward exploring conscious thought processes. This enterprise may be suspected of anthropomorphism—the projection onto animals of our own thoughts and feelings. Ackerman is alert to this danger, and in  The Genius of Birds prefers to speak of “cognition” rather than the more human-sounding “intelligence.” Avian brain structures and neural connections are organized differently from ours, and birds’ experiences must also differ, she writes, though they may be rich in their own way.</p><p> 阿克曼（Ackerman）报告说，如今，对鸟类行为的研究已大大转向了探索有意识的思维过程。该企业可能被怀疑是拟人化的动物，即我们自己的思想和感觉投射到动物身上。 Ackerman警惕这种危险，在《鸟类的天才》中，他更喜欢讲“认知”，而不是听起来更人性化的“智慧”。她写道，鸟类的大脑结构和神经联系的组织方式与我们的不同，鸟类的经历也必须有所不同，尽管它们可能以自己的方式丰富。</p><p> Birds’ sensory organs, too, work differently from those of humans. Inevitably, birds inhabit a world of sights, sounds, and smells unlike ours. Bird vision exceeds ours in several respects: its power at a distance, its speed in resolving detail, its lateral breadth (in most cases), and its perception of a broader spectrum of colors. Notably, birds can see ultraviolet light. Some birds that look plain to us probably shine and sparkle to other birds. Birds can also detect the earth’s magnetic field, a sense that humans lack entirely. In a rare flight of fancy, Sibley imagines what a migrating black-and-white warbler “might see in the sky: a blue band of polarized light, and a reddish band oriented with the magnetic field with a stronger dot showing the slope of the magnetic field.”</p><p> 鸟类的感觉器官也与人类的感觉器官不同。不可避免地，鸟类栖息在与我们不同的视觉，声音和气味世界中。鸟类视觉在几个方面都超出了我们的视野：它在远处的力量，解决细节的速度，横向宽度（在大多数情况下）以及对更广泛颜色的感知。值得注意的是，鸟类可以看到紫外线。一些对我们来说平淡的鸟类可能会向其他鸟类发光并闪耀。鸟类还可以检测地球的磁场，这是人类完全缺乏的一种感觉。在一次罕见的幻想中，西布尔（Sibley）想象着一只正在迁移的黑白莺“可能会在天空中看到”：一个偏振光的蓝带，一个与磁场对准的带红色的带，带有一个更强的点，显示了斜率。磁场。”</p><p> For a long time birds were reputed to have no sense of smell. Audubon, for instance, proved to his own satisfaction that turkey vultures located carrion exclusively by sight. But in fact these birds have unusually large olfactory organs. They locate carrion by smell but prefer fresh carrion and thus disdained Audubon’s highly decayed offering. Oil company engineers nowadays add a sulfurous chemical to natural gas; they can then find pipeline leaks because turkey vultures will circle over them.</p><p> 长期以来，人们都认为鸟类没有嗅觉。例如，奥杜邦（Audubon）满意地证明了火鸡秃鹰仅凭肉眼就能看到腐肉。但实际上，这些鸟的嗅觉器官异常大。他们通过气味找到腐肉，但更喜欢新鲜的腐肉，因此鄙视奥杜邦的腐烂产品。如今，石油公司的工程师向天然气中添加了一种含硫化学物质。然后他们会发现管道泄漏，因为火鸡秃鹰会在它们上盘旋。</p><p> Birds can hear a wider range of sounds than humans, and hearing plays an outsized part in their lives. Although it may be a stretch to claim analogies to human language, as Ackerman does, birds communicate very actively by calls and songs. The two are not the same. Calls are short signals used year-round that can transmit socially important information: not merely the approach of a dangerous predator, for example, but what kind of predator it is—snake, hawk, cat, human. Birdsong contains more elaborate messages, usually related to breeding. They have various other functions: claiming territory, warning away rival males, and even, as sentimental humans imagine, convincing a female of the singer’s advantages.</p><p> 与人类相比，鸟类可以听到的声音范围更广，而且声音在他们的生活中起着举足轻重的作用。尽管可能像Ackerman所说的那样与人类语言进行类比，但鸟儿却通过电话和歌曲进行非常积极的交流。两者不一样。通话是常年使用的短信号，可以传递重要的社会信息：例如，不仅是危险捕食者的方法，而且是蛇，鹰，猫，人等哪种捕食者。 Birdsong包含更详尽的信息，通常与繁殖有关。它们还有其他功能：夺取领土，警告男性对手，甚至如多愁善感的人类所想象的那样，使女性相信歌手的优势。 </p><p> Birdsong involves both innate and learned elements. The urge to sing seems to be innate in songbirds, for those raised in captivity try to sing upon reaching sexual maturity. Having never heard a male of their species sing, however, they produce babble rather than the appropriate song. As nestlings they learn specific songs from adult males, including their father, who sings nearby. The males of other species also sing nearby, of course, but some innate template prevents nestlings from learning their songs.  1 A window of readiness in the development of the young avian brain seems to enable this particular form of learning, just as a window favorable to language-learning exists in the development of human children.</p><p>Birdsong涉及先天和博学的元素。唱歌的欲望似乎是在鸣禽中天生的，因为那些圈养的人会在性成熟时尝试唱歌。但是，由于从未听过同一种雄性唱歌，所以会发出ba啪声，而不是适当的歌曲。作为雏鸟，他们从成年男子那里学习特定的歌曲，其中包括在附近唱歌的父亲。当然，其他物种的雄性也在附近唱歌，但是某些先天性模板阻止雏鸟学习其歌曲。 1年轻人禽脑发育的准备就绪窗口似乎可以实现这种特殊形式的学习，就像人类儿童的发育中存在有利于语言学习的窗口一样。</p><p>  Donald Kroodsma of the University of Massachusetts, a leading authority on birdsong, found by careful listening and recording that songbirds don’t just repeat the same phrases. They choose, apparently deliberately, within a repertoire.  2 Not all birds sing; about four thousand species, somewhat fewer than half the total, are classified as songbirds. These have specialized neuron clusters in their brains for creating and recognizing song.  3</p><p>  马萨诸塞州大学的唐纳德·克鲁斯玛（Donald Kroodsma）是鸟鸣声的领先权威，他通过仔细聆听和录音发现，鸣鸟不只是重复相同的短语。他们显然是有意选择曲目。 2不是所有的鸟都唱歌。大约有四千种，比总数少一半。它们在大脑中具有专门的神经元簇，用于创建和识别歌曲。 3</p><p> Nest-building is another complex avian activity in which inherited and learned behaviors mingle. Nest-building, like birdsong, appears even in birds reared in captivity and in isolation and so is likely an innate capacity. Construction techniques must also be innate, for each bird’s nest closely resembles others made by the same species. Astonishingly intricate workmanship can be involved. In Connecticut a few springs ago my wife and I watched a red-winged blackbird weaving long grass stems into its nest and attaching them by making a loop and then passing one end through the loop and drawing it tight. The selection of a site, however, must involve a more conscious choice. For example, a bird whose nest fails in one location usually tries a different, though species-specific, place.</p><p> 筑巢是另一种复杂的鸟类活动，其中遗传和习得的行为混杂在一起。像鸟鸣一样，筑巢甚至出现在圈养和孤立饲养的鸟类中，因此很可能具有先天的能力。施工技术也必须是天生的，因为每个燕窝都非常类似于同一物种的其他燕窝。可能会涉及到惊人的复杂工艺。几年前的春天，在我的妻子和我的康涅狄格州，我看到一只红翼黑鸟将长长的草茎编织到巢中，并通过套环将它们连接起来，然后将一端穿过套环并将其拉紧。但是，选择站点必须涉及更自觉的选择。例如，一只鸟的巢在一个位置失败的鸟通常会尝试一个不同的位置，尽管特定于物种。</p><p> Tool-using in birds arouses particular interest. The clever New Caledonian crow makes picks out of plant parts with which to extract otherwise inaccessible food. In captivity these birds bend wire into hooks for the same purpose. The woodpecker finch of the Galápagos Islands uses cactus spines similarly. A green heron has been filmed luring fish with a piece of bread. When the bread starts to float away, the bird realigns it. A fish nibbles and is seized.</p><p> 在鸟类中使用工具引起了特别的兴趣。聪明的新喀里多尼亚乌鸦从植物部位中挑选出可以摘取否则无法获得的食物的食物。在圈养中，这些鸟出于相同的目的将电线弯曲成钩子。加拉帕戈斯群岛的啄木鸟雀科也使用仙人掌刺。拍摄了一只绿鹭，用一片面包诱鱼。当面包开始浮走时，小鸟将其重新对齐。一条鱼被咬了，被抓住了。</p><p> Memory is another competence in which some birds surpass humans. The champions here are jays and other members of the crow family that store food for later use. Clark’s nutcracker, a member of the crow family native to the mountains of the western United States, can hide over 30,000 seeds and recall their precise locations many months later. These birds not only can locate their food caches but also conceal them from rivals, and they know to retrieve first those likely to spoil.</p><p> 记忆是另一种胜过人类的能力。这里的拥护者是杰伊鸦和其他乌鸦家族成员，他们将食物储存起来以备后用。克拉克的胡桃钳是原产于美国西部山区的乌鸦家族的一员，可以藏匿3万多颗种子，并在几个月后回忆起它们的确切位置。这些鸟不仅可以找到他们的食物藏匿处，而且还可以将它们隐藏在对手面前，而且他们知道首先要取回那些可能变质的食物。</p><p> Elephants and dolphins recognize themselves in a mirror, displaying a sense of self rare outside human beings. If an experimenter places a stain on their bodies that they detect in a mirror, they attempt to remove it. Captive magpies with stickers placed on their feathers removed them once they saw them in a mirror. So far, magpies are the only birds shown to have this capacity. Though some can find concealed food by using a mirror, no other species is known to take actions that depend on self-identification in a mirror. Even the particularly accomplished African grey parrot Alex—owned by the animal behavior researcher Irene Pepperberg, who taught Alex more than one hundred words that he could apply to objects, actions, and colors, and also taught him to count up to six objects—when confronted with his own image in a mirror did not clearly identify it as himself.</p><p> 大象和海豚在镜子里认出自己，在人外展现出一种自我难得的感觉。如果实验者在镜子上检测到的身上留下了污渍，他们会尝试将其清除。一旦在镜子中看到喜them的喜stickers，便会在羽毛上贴上贴纸。到目前为止，喜pies是唯一显示出这种能力的鸟。尽管有些人可以使用镜子找到隐藏的食物，但是没有其他物种会采取依赖镜子自我识别的行动。甚至是动物行为研究人员艾琳·佩珀伯格（Irene Pepperberg）拥有的特别成就的非洲灰鹦鹉亚历克斯（Alex），当他教亚历克斯一百多个单词时，他可以将它们应用于物体，动作和颜色，还教他数到六个物体。在镜子中面对自己的形象并没有清楚地将其识别为自己。</p><p> Ackerman devotes an entire section of  The Bird Way to play. It is not an activity commonly attributed to birds, so powerful is a crude evolutionary utilitarianism according to which only behavior that favors survival will spread in an animal population. Therefore some biologists have interpreted play in young animals as training for essential adult activities like hunting for food. Some adult birds, however, particularly members of the crow and parrot families, engage widely in activities with no apparent link to survival. The kea, a large New Zealand parrot, is, Ackerman says, “the most extravagantly playful of all birds.” Voraciously novelty-seeking and apparently “motivated more by play than food,” keas spend time tossing and catching objects and tussling with one another. Only slightly less playful are ravens, which, Ackerman tells us, have been observed sliding down snowbanks and other slopes, flying back up, and sliding down again. I have observed ravens executing complete rollovers in flight, an activity without apparent utility.</p><p> 阿克曼（Akerman）致力于《小鸟之路》的整个演出。它不是通常归因于鸟类的活动，因此粗略的进化功利主义非常有力，据此，只有有利于生存的行为才会在动物种群中传播。因此，一些生物学家将幼小动物的玩耍理解为对成年人基本活动的训练，例如狩猎食物。但是，一些成年鸟类，特别是乌鸦和鹦鹉家族的成员，广泛从事与生存没有明显联系的活动。阿克曼说，这种大型新西兰鹦鹉“凯阿”是“所有鸟类中最奢侈的嬉戏”。 keas十分追求新奇，显然是“娱乐性强于食物，而不是食物”，他们会花时间互相抛掷并捉住物体和打架。阿克曼（Ackerman）告诉我们，乌鸦的嬉戏性稍差一些，据观察，乌鸦从雪堆和其他斜坡滑下，飞回，然后再次滑下。我观察到乌鸦在飞行中执行了完整的翻滚，这项活动没有明显的实用性。 </p><p> Emotion in birds is a tricky subject, vulnerable to the most egregious sentimental projections. Birds certainly experience some emotions; their fear or anger is often obvious. Seeking evidence of less overt emotions in birds, however, quickly turns speculative. Ackerman asserts that birds experience love and grief, but on this point, exceptionally, she offers no supporting evidence.</p><p>鸟类的情感是一个棘手的话题，容易受到最令人震惊的情感预测的影响。鸟类当然会感到一些情绪；他们的恐惧或愤怒常常很明显。寻求鸟类不那么明显的情绪的证据很快就变成了投机。阿克曼声称鸟类会经历爱与悲伤，但是在这一点上，她例外地没有提供任何佐证。</p><p>  My wife and I once witnessed bird behavior that irresistibly suggested bereavement. In You Yangs National Park, near Melbourne, Australia, we came upon some white-winged choughs, striking crow-sized black-and-white birds known for a complicated communal breeding regime. They were dancing frantically around the corpse of one of their group that had been killed by a car. Were they mourning, expressing alarm, warning others, or simply confused? Their agitation and its cause seemed evident. But if it is only by inference from our own emotions that we dimly apprehend those of another person, how can we claim to fathom the emotions of animals?</p><p>  我和我的妻子曾经目睹过无法抗拒的丧亲之鸟行为。在澳大利亚墨尔本附近的尤扬斯国家公园中，我们遇到了一些白翅红嘴鸦，撞击着乌鸦大小的黑白鸟，这些鸟以复杂的公共繁殖制度而闻名。他们在一个被汽车杀死的一群人的尸体周围疯狂地跳舞。他们是在哀悼，发出警报，警告他人还是只是感到困惑？他们的激动和起因似乎很明显。但是，如果仅凭我们自己的情绪推断而模糊地理解了另一个人的情绪，那么我们又怎能声称是想了解动物的情绪呢？</p><p> Birds can recognize individual humans. Dr. Kevin McGowan of Cornell University, whose study of common crows required invading their nests and placing numbered and colored leg bands on their young, was thereafter singled out by the crows for angry attacks. Dr. John Marzluff of the University of Washington, an authority on birds’ adaptation to urban environments, found that some crows even give gifts to people who regularly feed them.  4</p><p> 鸟类可以识别人类。康奈尔大学的凯文·麦克高恩（Kevin McGowan）博士对常见的乌鸦进行研究，要求侵入它们的巢穴，并在其幼崽上放置编号和彩色的腿带，然后被乌鸦挑出来进行愤怒的攻击。华盛顿大学负责鸟类适应城市环境的主管机构的约翰·马兹鲁夫博士发现，一些乌鸦甚至还向定期喂食它们的人送礼物。 4</p><p> Migration makes particularly heavy demands on birds. About 40 percent of the world’s nearly 11,000 bird species travel seasonally between a breeding area and a wintering area, which is sometimes thousands of miles away. This journey can require prodigious physical stamina. Bar-tailed godwits—pigeon-sized long-legged shorebirds—travel nonstop each fall from Alaska to New Zealand, a distance of over seven thousand miles. Lacking waterproof plumage, they cannot rest on the water. Seven days or more of uninterrupted flight requires a radical marshaling of the body’s energy sources, during which the godwit loses half its weight.</p><p> 迁徙对鸟类的需求特别大。世界上将近11,000种鸟类中，约40％的鸟类在繁殖区和越冬地区（有时相距数千英里）之间进行季节性旅行。这段旅程可能需要巨大的体力。从阿拉斯加落下的长尾shore-鸽子大小的长腿shore鸟-每次从阿拉斯加坠落到新西兰，直达七千多英里。缺少防水羽毛，它们不能放在水上。连续七天或更长时间的飞行需要对人体的能量进行彻底的调整，在此期间，黑知更鸟的体重减轻了一半。</p><p> Migration’s mental demands are as daunting as its physical ones. Every autumn migratory birds find an appropriate location thousands of miles away for the nonbreeding season. Then they return in spring to the neighborhood of their birth for nesting. When nesting is done, they relocate to the identical winter quarters. This has been proven by marking birds, as Audubon did in 1803 by placing a silver thread on the leg of a nesting eastern phoebe at his mill in Pennsylvania. The bird returned to the same site the following spring.</p><p> 迁移对精神的要求与对身体的要求一样艰巨。每年秋天，候鸟在非繁殖季节都位于数千英里以外的合适位置。然后，他们在春季回到其出生地附近进行筑巢。嵌套完成后，它们将移至相同的冬季区域。这已经通过标记鸟类来证明，就像奥杜邦（Audubon）在1803年所做的那样，在他位于宾夕法尼亚州的工厂中，将银线放在嵌套的东部菲比腿上。第二年春天，这只鸟回到了同一地点。</p><p> One female rufous hummingbird displayed impressive navigational prowess. In the fall of 1996, misdirected on her way south, she wound up at a bird feeder in Agawam, Massachusetts, instead of in Mexico. Her migratory urges spent, she settled in and would have perished during the winter if she had not been transferred to a greenhouse in Northampton. Released the following spring, this tiny bird departed, presumably to her birth region somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, only to return to Agawam the following fall. She spent six successive winters in the Northampton greenhouse. Ackerman does not discuss this well-known case, but she mentions other marked hummingbirds that return to particular feeders after long absences. She further reports that hummingbirds have a sophisticated internal map that permits them to keep track of which flowers in a vast field they have already drained of nectar and which ones remain untapped.</p><p> 一只雌性红褐色的蜂鸟显示出令人印象深刻的导航能力。 1996年秋天，她在向南的途中被误导，在马萨诸塞州阿加瓦姆（而不是墨西哥）的喂鸟器上受伤。她的迁徙欲望度过了，她安顿下来，如果不转移到北安普敦的温室里，她会在冬天灭绝。次年春天释放了这只小鸟，大概是在西北太平洋的某个地方离开了她的出生地，第二年秋天才返回阿瓦加姆。她在北安普敦温室连续度过了六个冬天。 Ackerman没有讨论这个著名的案例，但是她提到了其他的有标记的蜂鸟，它们在长期缺席之后会返回特定的饲养者。她进一步报告说，蜂鸟有一张复杂的内部图，可以让他们跟踪在广阔的田地中哪些花已经耗尽了花蜜，而哪些花还没有被挖掘。</p><p>  Navigation requires not only situating oneself on a mental map, but also knowing in what direction and for how long one must travel to reach a destination. Migratory birds’ semiannual journeys mingle innate and learned behaviors. Travel restlessness sets in among migratory species when it is time to depart, probably activated by changing day length. This urge appears also in caged birds that belong to migratory species, even those reared in captivity and in isolation. Ackerman is little concerned with such innate behaviors, however interesting. Learning, however, may also come into play in bird migration, particularly in some larger species. Younger ducks and geese follow older ones already familiar with mountain ranges, rivers, and coastlines. In other species, like shorebirds, adults and juveniles go south at different times and by different routes.</p><p>  导航不仅需要将自己置于心智图上，还需要知道他朝着哪个方向以及经过多长时间才能到达目的地。候鸟每半年的旅程会混合先天和习得的行为。到了该离开的时候，旅行的不安情绪就会出现在迁徙物种中，这很可能是由于白天时间的改变而引起的。这种渴望也出现在属于候鸟的笼养鸟中，即使是圈养和隔离饲养的鸟也是如此。 Ackerman很少关心这种先天的行为，但是很有趣。但是，学习也可能在鸟类迁徙中发挥作用，特别是在一些较大的物种中。较年轻的鸭子和鹅跟随已经熟悉山脉，河流和海岸线的较老的鸭子和鹅。在其他物种中，例如水鸟，成年和幼体在不同的时间以不同的路线向南行驶。 </p><p> Still more competences may assist in bird migration. In addition to the earth’s magnetic field, which birds can detect, low-frequency sounds like those made by the sea may help some find their way. Even smell may assist in finding a precise location. Bird navigation involves multiple capabilities, and Ackerman wisely admits that many remain mysterious.</p><p>更多的能力可能会帮助鸟类迁移。除了鸟类可以察觉的地球磁场外，像海声一样的低频声音也可能有助于某些人找到自己的路。甚至气味也可能有助于找到精确的位置。鸟类导航涉及多种功能，阿克曼明智地承认其中许多功能仍然神秘。</p><p> Why do some species of birds burden themselves with the extra effort and risk imposed by migration? The inherent dangers of these long journeys, already considerable, have been greatly increased in recent years by the popularity among the inhabitants of some Mediterranean coastal countries, especially Malta, Cyprus, and Egypt, of shooting and netting millions of migratory birds. Parts of the Caribbean are not much better. This behavior is more a sport and a rite of passage for young men who can afford Jeeps and Kalashnikovs than a means of alleviating hunger.  5 In  Flights of Passage Mike Unwin and David Tipling estimate the toll at 500 million birds a year. They also explore the origins of bird migration briefly in their introductory pages. They repeat the scientific consensus that traces migration as an evolutionary adaptation to the end of the last ice age, when new territory became available, with abundant food and little competition but a harsh winter. Their aim, however, is not a review of scientific knowledge of bird migration but a “celebration of the wonders” of it.</p><p> 为什么某些鸟类会负担额外的工作量和迁徙带来的风险？近年来，由于一些地中海沿岸国家，特别是马耳他，塞浦路斯和埃及的居民，成千上万只候鸟迁徙和捕网，这种长途跋涉的固有危险已经大大增加。加勒比的部分地区并不好。对于可以负担吉普车和卡拉什尼科夫车的年轻人来说，这种行为更像是一项运动和一种通过仪式，而不是减轻饥饿的一种手段。 5在《飞行之旅》中，迈克·温温（Mike Unwin）和戴维·蒂普林（David Tipling）估计每年造成5亿只鸟死亡。他们还在介绍页中简要探讨了鸟类迁徙的起源。他们重复了科学上的共识，即将迁徙作为进化适应追溯到上一个冰河时代的末尾，那时新的土地面世了，食物丰富，竞争少，但严寒。然而，他们的目标不是回顾鸟类迁徙的科学知识，而是“赞扬奇迹”。</p><p> Bird migration involves multiple strategies, far beyond a simple north-south journey. Ducks assemble in late summer at traditional locations hundreds or even thousands of miles from their nesting areas, where they undergo a complete plumage molt, becoming flightless and vulnerable for a time, before going south; seabirds like albatrosses and petrels follow an immense figure-eight loop from the South Seas to the north and back again when they have finished nesting; some desert species in Africa and Australia engage in nomadism in search of food and water.</p><p> 鸟类迁徙涉及多种策略，远远超出了简单的南北旅程。鸭子在夏末在离巢区数百乃至数千英里的传统地点聚集，在那里它们经历了完整的羽毛蜕变，一会儿就无法飞行并变得脆弱，然后才向南移动。海鸟像信天翁和海燕沿着巨大的八字形环从南海向北延伸，当它们完成筑巢时又返回。非洲和澳大利亚的一些沙漠物种从事游牧活动以寻找食物和水。</p><p> Unwin and Tipling illustrate many of these strategies with a selection of sixty-seven species of birds, drawn from all the continents except South America. That continent has its own seasonal bird migration pattern that mirrors the northern one. Fork-tailed flycatchers, for example, move from temperate southern Argentina northward to the tropics for the austral winter. Unwin and Tipling also omit altitudinal migration between highlands and lowlands in the world’s great mountain ranges.</p><p> Unwin和Tipling通过选择67种鸟类（这些物种来自南美以外的所有大洲）说明了许多策略。该大陆有其自己的季节性鸟类迁徙模式，与北部的情况类似。例如，在南方冬季，叉尾捕蝇器从温带南部的阿根廷北移到热带。 Unwin和Tipling还忽略了世界上大山脉在高地和低地之间的垂直迁移。</p><p> Otherwise their handsome book surveys most migration strategies, each species accompanied by a brief text and a rudimentary map of the routes followed. Though simple, these maps show the great variety of migratory behavior. I found only one that is misleading: the map for the northern wheatear, whose Greenland population returns eastward to Europe and whose Alaskan population returns westward to Siberia before going south. One might further object that some maps of seabird movements give an impression of random wandering, although these birds have routes and schedules.</p><p> 否则，他们那本漂亮的书会调查大多数的迁徙策略，每个物种都附有简短的文字和基本路线图。这些地图虽然简单，但却显示出各种各样的迁徙行为。我发现只有一个令人误解的地方：北麦翁尔的地图，该国的格陵兰岛人口向东返回欧洲，其阿拉斯加人口向西返回西伯利亚，然后再向南延伸。可能还会有人提出反对意见，尽管有些海鸟有路线和时间表，但有些海鸟运动图给人以随机游荡的印象。</p><p> That migration is not fully innate is shown by the existence of nonmigratory populations within largely migratory species, and the converse. Most Americans now know Canada geese primarily from their unwanted year-round presence on golf courses and in public parks. These nonmigratory geese are actually a human artifact, distinct from their migratory cousins that still pass southward each autumn in their familiar V-shaped skeins. Some of them descend from hand-reared geese that hunters once used as decoys. Farmers looking for additional income bred them for that purpose. When live decoys were made illegal in 1935, these semi-tame geese, now useless, were released. Spreading rapidly and breeding abundantly, they took up permanent residence in urban North America’s green spaces.  6 The US Fish and Wildlife Service further augmented the resident component of the goose population by releasing birds hand-reared for hunting.</p><p> 迁移不是完全先天的，这主要是由于在大部分迁徙物种中存在非迁移种群而相反。现在，大多数美国人主要是由于在高尔夫球场和公园里全年无所事事而了解加拿大鹅。这些非迁徙的鹅实际上是人为产物，不同于它们的表亲，它们每年秋天仍会以熟悉的V形绞线向南掠过。其中一些来自人工饲养的鹅，这些鹅曾经被猎人用作诱饵。寻求额外收入的农民为此育出了他们。 1935年，将活诱饵定为非法时，这些现在没用的半鹅被释放了。它们迅速传播并繁殖丰富，并在北美城市的绿地中永久居住。 6美国鱼类和野生动物服务处释放了人工捕猎的鸟类，进一步增加了鹅种群的居民数量。</p><p> An opposite example, in which migration was gained rather than lost, is the house finch, a mostly sedentary resident of the American Southwest and Mexico. In the 1940s a few of these birds, which had probably been captured near Los Angeles, were released near New York City by bird dealers who feared prosecution for illegal trade in native American bird species when an Audubon Society inspector showed up. These birds prospered and spread throughout eastern North America. Some of that population now migrates south to avoid Yankee winters. This is likely a genetic evolution, those finches that moved seasonally having survived better than those that stayed put.</p><p> 一个相反的例子是迁徙而不是失去，这是雀科，这是美国西南部和墨西哥的大部分定居者。在1940年代，这些鸟类中的一些可能是在洛杉矶附近捕获的，它们是由鸟类贩子在纽约市附近释放的，他们担心当奥杜邦协会的一名检查员出现时会起诉美国本土鸟类的非法贸易。这些鸟繁盛，并散布在整个北美东部。该人口中的一些人现在向南迁移以避免扬基冬天。这可能是一种遗传进化，那些季节性迁徙的雀科比存活的雀科存活的更好。 </p><p> Birds are highly adaptable, and both their behavior and their physical characteristics may change as opportunities arise. The blackcap, a European warbler, formerly migrated in the fall from Northern Europe to Africa. As a milder climate and the practice of bird-feeding made the southern UK more favorable to them, those blackcaps that occasionally wintered there survived better than the population that was exposed to the dangers of crossing the Mediterranean, the Sahara Desert, and the Sahel and those regions’ annual slaughter. Blackcaps now commonly winter in the UK.</p><p>鸟类具有高度适应性，随着机会的出现，鸟类的行为和身体特征也会发生变化。黑帽，是欧洲莺，以前在秋天从北欧迁移到非洲。由于温和的气候和喂鸟的习俗使英国南部对他们更有利，那些偶尔越冬的黑d存活下来的人口要比面临穿越地中海，撒哈拉沙漠，萨赫勒和这些地区的年度屠杀量。黑帽现在通常在英国过冬。</p><p> Such adaptation is possible because birds differ individually within species. The British ornithologist Tim Birkhead tells of the ancient practice, mentioned by Pliny the Elder, of training captive goldfinches to pull up a tiny bucket on a chain in order to obtain food and water. The birds pull up a length of chain and then stand on it while they reach for another length. But not all goldfinches tested by modern scientists could perform this trick, according to Birkhead. About a quarter of captive goldfinches figured it out for themselves. Another quarter could do it if they watched others. The rest never learned the trick at all.  7</p><p> 这种适应是可能的，因为鸟类在物种内部各不相同。英国鸟类学家蒂姆·伯克黑德（Tim Birkhead）讲述了古老的做法，老普林尼（Pliny the Elder）提到，这种做法是训练圈养的金翅雀在链上拉起一个小桶，以获取食物和水。鸟拉起一段链条，然后站在另一条链条上。但是，根据伯克黑德的说法，并非所有现代科学家测试过的金翅雀都能实现这一技巧。大约四分之一的圈养金翅雀自己解决了。如果他们看着其他人，则有四分之一的人可以做到。其余的人根本没学过窍门。 7</p><p> Of the writing and making of bird books there is no end, because they are profitable.
