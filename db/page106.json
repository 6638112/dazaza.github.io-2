But sometimes it is necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary,&#34; Breyer wrote.\n   Breyer said that the court has made clear that students &#34;do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression even &#39;at the school house gate.&#39;&#34;\n  &#34;But,&#34; he said, &#34;we have also made clear that courts must apply the First Amendment in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.&#34;\n &#34;The school itself has an interest in protecting a student&#39;s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus. America&#39;s public schools are the nurseries of democracy,&#34; the opinion read.\n  &#34;F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything&#34; Brandi Levy, then 14, wrote in 2017. She was reacting to the fact that as a junior varsity cheerleader she had failed to get a spot on the varsity squad at Mahanoy Area High School in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania.\n When school officials learned of the outburst, Levy was suspended from the JV team for having violated school rules. But her lawyers sued, alleging the school had violated her freedom of speech. Levy is now 18 and a freshman at Bloomsburg University.\n Levy lauded the justices&#39; decision on Wednesday, saying in a statement: &#34;The school went too far, and I&#39;m glad that the Supreme Court agrees.&#34;\n &#34;Young people need to have the ability to express themselves without worrying about being punished when they get to school,&#34; she said. &#34;I never could have imagined that one simple snap would turn into a Supreme Court case, but I&#39;m proud that my family and I advocated for the rights of millions of public school students.&#34;\n  Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, writing that students like the former cheerleader &#34;who are active in extracurricular programs have a greater potential, by virtue of their participation, to harm those programs.&#34;\n &#34;For example, a profanity-laced screed delivered on social media or at the mall has a much different effect on a football program when done by a regular student than when done by the captain of the football team. So, too, here,&#34; Thomas wrote.\n  Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Wednesday&#39;s ruling is a &#34;rare win&#34; for students in speech cases at the Supreme Court.\n  &#34;Today&#39;s decision may seem obvious to those who have a hard time seeing why public schools should be able to regulate any and all off-campus speech by students, but the fact that the court is identifying circumstances in which they can&#39;t is actually a big deal,&#34; Vladeck said.\n &#34;Although the line between the off-campus speech that schools can and can&#39;t regulate is less than clear, the fact that there is a line will have significant ramifications for just about all public school administrators going forward. It&#39;s a rare win for a student in a speech case before the current court,&#34; he added.\n At oral arguments, several of the justices struggled with where they could draw the line if they allowed schools to discipline students for speech directed at the school that occurs off-campus.\n Breyer, for example, acknowledged that Levy used &#34;unattractive swear words,&#34; but he questioned whether it caused a &#34;material and substantial disruption&#34; to the school.\n &#34;I don&#39;t see much evidence it did,&#34; he said, noting that teenagers, when talking to each other, often swear when they are off-campus.\n &#34;I mean, my goodness, every school in the country would be doing nothing but punishing,&#34; Breyer said.\n David Cole, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer for Levy, said that his client was &#34;merely expressing frustration with a four-letter word to her friends outside of school on a weekend.&#34; She wasn&#39;t sending a threat or an attempt to bully another student.\n &#34;The message may seem trivial, but for young people, the ability to voice their emotions to friends without fear of school censorship may be the most important freedom of all,&#34; he said.\n Lisa Blatt, a lawyer for the Mahanoy Area School District, told the justices that the line should be drawn not based on where the speech occurred, but on whether it caused a substantial disruption to the school.\n &#34;Off-campus speech, particularly on social media can be disruptive,&#34; she said, because of the internet&#39;s &#34;ubiquity, instantaneous and mass dissemination.&#34;\n Levy&#39;s case drew the support of Mary Beth and John Tinker, who won a landmark school speech case in 1969 that allowed them to wear a black armband on campus to protest the Vietnam War.\n  The high court held then that students do not shed &#34;their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,&#34; but said that some speech on school grounds could be could be punished.\n The justices took into consideration the special characteristics of a school environment and said that public school officials could regulate speech that would &#34;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.&#34; The opinion, however, dealt only with speech on school grounds related to the school.\n Levy won in the lower courts. A district court found that the school had not shown that she waived her speech rights as a condition of joining the cheerleading team. A federal appeals court affirmed, relying on the fact that the speech hadn&#39;t occurred in the campus environment which would include school-sponsored events and field trips.\n Breyer disagreed with the reasoning of a lower court opinion that held that a school could never regulate speech that takes place off campus, but at the same time he declined to set forth what he called &#34;a broad, highly general First Amendment rules stating just what counts as &#39;off-campus speech.&#34;\n Instead, he allowed that while the cheerleader&#39;s post were &#34;crude&#34; they &#34;did not amount to fighting words.&#34; He said that while she used &#34;vulgarity&#34; her speech was not &#34;obscene.&#34;\n   In addition, her post appeared &#34;outside of school hours from a location outside of school&#34; and they did not target any member of the school community with &#34;abusive&#34; language. He added that she used her own personal cellphone and her audience consisted of a private circle of Snapchat friends. Breyer said &#34;these features of her speech&#34; diminish the school&#39;s interest in punishing her.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:45:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

It allows them to find food, avoid danger and attract mates; it dominates their perceptions and guides their behavior; it dictates how they interpret and respond to the deluge of sensory information all around them.\n \u201cHow we as biological creatures interface with chemistry in the world is profoundly important for understanding who we are and how we navigate the universe,\u201d said  Bob Datta, a neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n Yet olfaction might also be the least well understood of our senses, in part because of the complexity of the inputs it must reckon with. What we might label as a single odor \u2014 the smell of coffee in the morning, of wet grass after a summer storm, of shampoo or perfume \u2014 is often a mixture of hundreds of types of chemicals. For an animal to detect and discriminate between the many scents that are key to its survival, the limited repertoire of receptors on its olfactory sensory neurons must somehow recognize a vast number of compounds. So an individual receptor has to be able to respond to many diverse, seemingly unrelated odor molecules.\n That versatility is at odds with the traditional lock-and-key model governing how selective chemical interactions tend to work. \u201cIn high school biology, that\u2019s what I learned about ligand-receptor interactions,\u201d said  Annika Barber, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University. \u201cSomething has to fit precisely in a site, and then it changes the [protein\u2019s atomic arrangement], and then it works.\u201d\n Now, new work has taken a crucial and much anticipated step forward in elucidating the beginning stages of the olfactory process. In a preprint  posted online earlier this year, a team of researchers at Rockefeller University in New York provided the first molecular view of an olfactory receptor as it bound to an odor molecule. \u201cThat\u2019s been a dream in the field\u201d ever since olfactory receptors were discovered 30 years ago, said  Richard Benton, a biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland who was not involved in the new study.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s unequivocally a landmark paper,\u201d Datta said. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve had access to receptors as molecules for a long time, no one\u2019s ever actually seen with their eyes what it looks like when an odor binds to a receptor.\u201d\n The result goes a long way toward confirming how animals identify and discriminate among astronomical numbers of smells. It also sheds light on key principles of receptor activity that might have far-reaching implications \u2014 for the evolution of chemical perception, for our understanding of how other neurological systems and processes work, and for practical applications like the development of targeted drugs and insect repellents.\n Several hypotheses have competed to explain how olfactory receptors achieve the necessary flexibility. Some scientists proposed that receptors respond to a single feature of odor molecules, such as shape or size; the brain might then identify an odor from some combination of those inputs. Other researchers posited that each receptor has multiple binding sites, enabling different kinds of compounds to dock. But to figure out which of these ideas was correct, they needed to see the receptor\u2019s actual structure.\n The Rockefeller team turned to receptor interactions in the jumping bristletail, an ancestral ground-dwelling insect that has a particularly simple olfactory receptor system.\n In insects, olfactory receptors are ion channels that activate when an odor molecule binds to them. They may be the largest and most divergent family of ion channels in nature, with millions of variants across the world\u2019s insect species. And so they must carefully balance generality against specificity, staying flexible enough to detect an enormous number of potential odors while being selective enough to reliably recognize the important ones, which could differ considerably from one species or environment to another.\n  What was the mechanism that allowed them to navigate that fine line, and to evolve that way? \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy system to think about,\u201d said  Vanessa Ruta, a neuroscientist at Rockefeller University who led the research reported in the recent preprint. \u201cSo we realized that the best way to gain insight into this problem would probably be through structural methods.\u201d\n Traditional methods for pinning down the three-dimensional molecular structure of proteins don\u2019t work well on olfactory receptors, which tend to misfold, behave abnormally or become difficult to distinguish under the conditions that those analyses require. But recent technological advances, most notably  an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy, made it possible for Ruta and her colleagues to try.\n They looked at the structure of a jumping bristletail olfactory receptor in three different configurations: by itself, and bound to either a common odor molecule called eugenol (which smells like clove to humans) or the insect repellant DEET. They then compared those structures, down to their individual atoms, to understand how odor binding opened the ion channel, and how a single receptor could detect chemicals of very different shapes and sizes.\n  The researchers found that although DEET and eugenol don\u2019t have much in common as molecules, they both docked at the same site within the receptor. That turned out to be a deep, geometrically simple pocket, lined with many amino acids that facilitate loose, weak interactions; eugenol and DEET took advantage of different interactions to lodge within it. Further computational modeling showed that each molecule was able to bind in many different orientations \u2014 and that many other kinds of odor compounds, though not all, could bind to the receptor in a similar way. This was no lock-and-key mechanism, but a one-size-fits-many approach.\n  The receptor \u201cis doing a more holistic recognition of the molecule, as opposed to just detecting any specific structural feature,\u201d Ruta said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very different chemical logic.\u201d\n When Ruta and her team introduced changes to the receptor\u2019s pocket, they found that mutations of even a single amino acid were enough to alter its binding properties. And that, in turn, was enough to affect the receptor\u2019s interactions with many compounds, entirely reconfiguring what the receptor responded to.\n Widening the pocket, for instance, increased its affinity for DEET, a larger molecule, while decreasing its affinity for eugenol, which may not have been able to fit as snugly due to its smaller size. Such changes would have many downstream effects on the receptor\u2019s broader odor-detecting palette, too, which the researchers were not set up to identify.\n The team\u2019s observations may explain how insect olfactory receptors can generally evolve so rapidly and diverge so much among species. Every insect species may have evolved \u201cits unique repertoire of receptors that are really well suited to its particular chemical niche,\u201d Ruta said.\n \u201cIt tells us that more is going on than just the idea that receptors loosely interact with a bunch of ligands,\u201d Datta said. A receptor built around a single binding pocket, with a response profile that can be retuned by the smallest of tweaks, could speed up evolution by freeing it to explore a broad spectrum of chemical repertoires.\n  The architecture of the receptor also supported this view. Ruta and her colleagues found that it consisted of four protein subunits loosely bound at the channel\u2019s central pore, like the petals of a flower. Only the central region needed to be conserved as the receptor diversified and evolved; the genetic sequences governing the rest of the receptor units were less constrained. This structural organization meant the receptor could accommodate a wide degree of diversification.\n Such light evolutionary constraints at the receptor level probably impose substantial selective pressure downstream on the neural circuits for olfaction: Nervous systems need good mechanisms for decoding the messy patterns of receptor activity. \u201cEffectively, olfactory systems have evolved to take arbitrary patterns of receptor activation and endow them with meaning through learning and experience,\u201d Ruta said.\n Intriguingly, though, nervous systems don\u2019t seem to be making the problem easier for themselves. Scientists had widely supposed that all the receptors on an individual olfactory neuron were of the same class, and that neurons for different classes went to segregated processing regions of the brain. In a  pair of preprints  posted last November, however, researchers reported that in both flies and mosquitoes, individual olfactory neurons express multiple classes of receptors. \u201cWhich is really surprising, and would increase the diversity of sensory perception even more,\u201d Barber said.\n The findings from Ruta\u2019s team are far from the last word on how olfactory receptors work. Insects use many other classes of ion channel olfactory receptors, including ones that are much more complex and much more specific than those of the jumping bristletail. In mammals, the olfactory receptor is not even an ion channel; it belongs to an entirely different family of proteins.\n  \u201cThis is the first structure of odorant recognition in any receptor from any species. But it\u2019s probably not the only mechanism of odorant recognition,\u201d Ruta said. \u201cThis is just one solution to the problem. It would be very unlikely that it\u2019s the only solution.\u201d\n Even so, she and other researchers think there are many more general lessons to learn from the jumping bristletail\u2019s olfactory receptor. It\u2019s tempting, for instance, to imagine how this mechanism might apply to other receptors in the brains of animals \u2014 from those that detect neuromodulators like dopamine to those that are affected by various kinds of anesthetics \u2014 \u201cand how imprecise they are \u2018allowed\u2019 to be,\u201d Barber said. \u201cIt offers a fascinating model for continuing to explore nonspecific binding interactions.\u201d\n Perhaps this flexible-binding approach should be considered in other contexts as well, she added.  Research published in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in March, for example, suggested that even canonical lock-and-key ion channel receptors might not be as strictly selective as scientists thought.\n If many different kinds of proteins bind to receptors through flexible, weak interactions within some type of pocket, that principle could guide rational drug design for various diseases, particularly neurological conditions. At the very least, Ruta\u2019s work on the binding of DEET to an insect olfactory receptor could provide insights into how to develop targeted repellents. \u201cThe mosquito is still the deadliest animal on Earth\u201d because of the diseases it carries, Ruta said.\n  Her findings actually clarify a debate more than a half-century old about how DEET works. DEET is one of the most effective insect repellents, but scientists haven\u2019t understood why \u2014 whether it smells bad to insects, for instance, or whether it impairs their olfactory signaling. The work by Ruta and her colleagues elevates a different theory: that DEET confuses insects by activating lots of different receptors and flooding their olfactory system with meaningless signals.\n \u201cThe mystery of chemical recognition is something that we now have a structural lens to think about,\u201d Ruta said. \u201cStructural biology, at its best, is beautiful and clarifying and has amazing explanatory power. My lab does a lot of work in more cellular and systems neuroscience, and very few experiments have as much explanatory power as a structure does.\u201d\n Datta agreed about the structural biology approach. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a harbinger of things to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like the future.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:44:50", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "We&#39;d run our idea by some potential customers, build the product, and then immediately ride that sweet exponential growth curve off into early retirement.\n    In real life, even startups that go on to become billion-dollar companies typically go through phases like:\n  Spending months building features that potential customers say they&#39;d definitely pay for, only to have them not convert.\n  Finally getting to product-market fit, only to hire way too fast and create internal chaos.\n  Losing a key customer or running out of funding, and having to lay off most of the team.\n  Hiring junior developers to work on core products, often with little or no experience in the technologies being used.\n    Obviously you don&#39;t create a huge outcome without a ton of stuff going right along the way, but even at wildly successful startups the day-to-day experience is rarely glamorous.\n  Over the last couple decades we&#39;ve seen the majority of companies switch to using Agile and other project management methodologies that not only take these shifting contexts into account, but are entirely designed around them. What we haven&#39;t seen though, at least not to nearly the same extent, is the same level of thought being put into architecting the software itself. That is, in the same way that Agile is designed around the assumption that both a product team&#39;s priorities and its development velocity can \u2014 and likely will \u2014 change wildly, likewise the design patterns we use when creating software should be chosen to ensure that:\n  The business can not only keep the lights on, but can continue moving forward even if it&#39;s down to its last (junior) developer.\n  I wrote this guide to explain how to write software in a way that maximizes the number of chances your startup has to succeed \u2014 by making it easy to maintain development velocity regardless of the inevitable-but-unknowable future changes to team size, developer competence and experience, product functionality, etc. The idea is that, given the inherent uncertainty, startups can massively increase their odds of success by putting some basic systems in place to help maximize the number of ideas, features, and hypotheses they can test; in other words, maximizing &#34;lead bullets,&#34; to borrow the phrase from this  blog post by Ben Horowitz. What follows are a series of patterns and best practices for building REST APIs, designed especially for the needs of SaaS startups and consumer apps.  [1]\n  It&#39;s very important to understand how each technical recommendation will confer real-world benefits to your business, and the best way to do this is by discussing them in the context of the so-called  ilities. In software architecture, the ilities are the words we use to describe the characteristics of the codebase itself, unrelated to what that code is actually doing for the end user. Most existing advice on software architecture is written for $10B+ companies, and as such tends to focus on maximizing things like performance, scalability, availability, reliability, etc.  [2]\n This has actually created a huge problem. The issue is that, due to having studied CS in college, most engineers working at startups don&#39;t have a ton of business training. So what often happens is that these developers decide how to implement features by just copying the first recommendation that comes up in Google or Stack Overflow without first evaluating that advice from a business perspective, and since most of this advice is geared toward either Fortune 500 companies (at one extreme) or hackathon-type hobby projects (at the other), this inevitably leads to huge unseen costs.    So how should developers and managers be making decisions instead? Basically the way to consistently make good architecture decisions for any given business is knowing which ilities will create value, making sure the team understands why they create value, and then having a system in place to ensure that code is written in a way that aligns with this understanding.\n  When it comes to SaaS startups and consumer apps, specifically those with some users and traction but less than $100M in ARR, the key insight is that the APIs powering almost all of these businesses have the same basic characteristics:\n  Maintained by 8 or fewer developers at any given time, or could be if they were well-architected\n  Most of the complexity is in the business logic, rather than in advanced CS concepts\n  Because most startups have similar codebases and face similar challenges, it&#39;s usually the same set of ilities that will maximize each startup&#39;s likelihood of success. So which ilities are the most valuable for startups? In my experience the answer is:  predictability,  readability,  simplicity, and  upgradability. For each ility, I&#39;ll first explain how it creates value at a high level, and then give some specific patterns and rules you can apply to your own codebase. Lastly, I&#39;ll explain why I consider these patterns and rules to collectively be the   mise en place of modern web app development teams.\n    The code snippets in this guide are written using Python, Django, and  DRF, but they&#39;re purposely designed to be understandable even if you don&#39;t know much Python or Django. I&#39;ve created a full app using these code snippets to ensure they work, which is published  here. The reason for choosing Python is that it&#39;s generally the best language for startups with less than $100M in ARR; as the so-called second-best language for everything, Python gives startups the most optionality for experimenting with different product functionality and monetization models. It&#39;s also  easy to hire for. I do discuss some issues specific to Django, but most of this advice is applicable regardless of what language and web framework you&#39;re using.\n    Everyone knows that creating software is insanely expensive, and yet almost everyone still vastly underestimates its total cost of ownership.\n  According to various  academic and  industry estimates, 60% - 80% of the cost associated with any given line of code is incurred as maintenance after that line is originally written. This is due to bugs, changing feature requirements, updates to dependencies, unmaintained dependencies that need to be replaced or maintained in-house, etc. As such, it should be easy to understand why the best type of code is usually the code that  never gets written in the first place.\n    For context, it&#39;s important to understand that in most codebases, the bulk of maintenance costs aren&#39;t inevitable, but rather are because the existing code is written in such a way that makes it time consuming to read and understand. When developers new to a codebase are tasked with making even a basic change, it often takes days or weeks of research before the first lines of code get written or edited. This is true even for competent and experienced developers, so it&#39;s for this reason that the next best type of code is code that&#39;s utterly predictable.\n    Essentially, each REST endpoint should perform the same basic steps in the same order. This way if a person has enough knowledge to understand how any one endpoint works, they should have enough knowledge to understand how  every endpoint works. And if they&#39;re tasked with fixing a bug or adding a feature, there should be a simple step-by-step process they can use each time to find exactly where in the codebase they need to modify or extend the code.\n    Consider how every newspaper article follows the same basic  inverted pyramid format, and answers the same basic questions of  who,  what,  where,  when,  why, and  how. This convention doesn&#39;t in any way limit what topics journalists can write about or put any limit on the sophistication of their ideas; it just makes newspaper articles super easy to read even for folks at a middle school reading level, and makes it easy to remember the main ideas well enough to share with your friends.\n  This sort of clarity and lucidity is not just something we can \u2014 and should \u2014 aspire to within our code. Rather, it&#39;s something that we can actually get 85% of the way toward achieving just by making each of our endpoints follow the same predictable pattern.\n    The key insight is that there are up to seven basic steps that any given REST endpoint will perform. For many endpoints, there are multiple different orders in which you  could perform these steps, but there also happens to exist one specific order that always works for every endpoint. And as it turns out, there are substantial benefits to always performing these seven steps, or at least the subset that are necessary for any given endpoint, in the same way and in the same order:\n  Copy input to local variables \u2014 What parameters (query params or body params) does this endpoint take?\n    Validate user input \u2014 Ensure the user has supplied all of the same required parameters for this endpoint in the correct format. If there are errors, aggregate all of the input validation errors into a dictionary-style response as described below.\n  Enforce business requirements \u2014 Check for cases where the user is allowed to access the endpoint and submitted all of the required parameters correctly, but they aren&#39;t allowed to perform a specific action due to the business logic of the application. E.g. creating an account with a username that has already been taken. If there is an error, return the first error that occurs, as described below.\n  Perform business logic \u2014 Do whatever this endpoint is actually supposed to do, e.g. altering state in the database, returning data to the API consumer, sending data to a third-party processor, etc.\n  Return HTTP response \u2014 Return any data necessary for the API consumer(s), along with a status code.\n  This might strike some as being overly prescriptive and formulaic. But in much the same way that no one would want to go back to the age of  heroic medicine, embracing a subtler, more prosaic style comes with many benefits \u2014 vastly reducing the total cost of ownership of your codebase and increasing developer velocity more than anything else you could possibly implement. How? Quite simply, it&#39;s because:\n  New code should never go live without first being audited for correctness and security, among other things.\n  It&#39;s much faster to determine whether things have been done correctly if they always happen in the same order. For example, if you see that the user input hasn&#39;t been sanitized right at the beginning of a view, you don&#39;t need to read through all the methods that implement the business logic to see whether it&#39;s been done later \u2014 you already know that it&#39;s been done incorrectly and that there is a security problem.\n  In the future, fixing bugs, changing business logic, and doing maintenance will all require knowing where in the code to make changes. And if the implementation of each endpoint follows the same pattern, there&#39;s no need to waste hours or days reading through code that isn&#39;t relevant to what you need to accomplish.\n  As with our newspaper example above, ensuring that each endpoint conforms to this pattern will vastly reduce the time (and cost) required each time a reader needs to uncover the  Five Ws and How of that endpoint, e.g. in order to make any necessary changes. Let&#39;s look at an example code snippet for creating a new user account, written using Django and Django Rest Framework, and then walk through it step-by-step:\r\r class User(APIView):\r  permission_classes = ( AccountCreation, )\r  \r  # Create account\r  def post(self, request):\r  unsafe_username = request.data.get(&#34;username&#34;, &#34;&#34;)\r  unsafe_email_address = request.data.get(&#34;email_address&#34;, &#34;&#34;)\r  unsafe_terms_of_service_accepted = request.data.get(&#34;terms_of_service_accepted&#34;, None)\r  unsafe_password = request.data.get(&#34;password&#34;, &#34;&#34;)\r  \r  sanitized_username = sanitization_utils.strip_xss(unsafe_username)\r  sanitized_email_address = sanitization_utils.strip_xss(unsafe_email_address)\r  sanitized_terms_of_service_accepted = sanitization_utils.string_to_boolean(unsafe_terms_of_service_accepted)\r  \r  try:\r  user_model, auth_token = account_management_service.create_account(\r  request,\r  sanitized_username,\r  sanitized_email_address,\r  unsafe_password,\r  sanitized_terms_of_service_accepted,\r  )\r  except marshmallow.exceptions.ValidationError as e:\r  return get_validation_error_response(validation_error=e, http_status_code=422)\r  except custom_errors.UsernameAlreadyExistsError as e:\r  return get_business_requirement_error_response(business_logic_error=e, http_status_code=409)\r  except custom_errors.EmailAddressAlreadyExistsError as e:\r  return get_business_requirement_error_response(business_logic_error=e, http_status_code=409)\r  except custom_errors.TermsNotAcceptedError as e:\r  return get_business_requirement_error_response(business_logic_error=e, http_status_code=429)\r  \r  resp = { &#34;data&#34;: { &#34;auth_token&#34;: auth_token } }\r  return Response(data=resp, status=201)\n  So what exactly is happening here? Let&#39;s go through this line-by-line and discuss what makes this code snippet good.\n  Line 2: Specify who has access to each endpoint in the view. The important thing here is that the permissions for each endpoint are explicitly specified at the top of each view, not implicitly inherited from your Django settings file. This makes it easy to understand what&#39;s happening, audit the codebase for security issues, and make any changes if necessary in the future.\n  Lines 6 - 9: Copy each input parameter into a new variable. This makes it easy for anyone, including front-end developers and product managers, to figure out what input each endpoint is expecting \u2014 even before any documentation has been written. We prefix each variable with  unsafe_ to draw attention to the fact that they haven&#39;t yet been sanitized.\n  Lines 11 - 13: Always sanitize user input for security vulnerabilities.  [4] The one common exception to this rule is with passwords; they&#39;re only stored as hashes so there isn&#39;t an XSS vector, and accidentally stripping complexity from a password would be its own security risk. But aside from this one exception, user input should always be sanitized before doing anything else with it \u2014 validation, business logic, storage, presentation, etc. The reasons for this are explained in  Rule #4.\n  Lines 16-22: What the endpoint actually does; in this case, creating a user account. This is the method we would need to dig into if we wanted to understand the implementation details of how accounts are actually created. One quick thing to note is that we&#39;re calling  account_management_service.create_account(...) rather than importing the service method  create_account from  account_management_service and calling it directly. This lets the reader immediately know which file they&#39;d need to open to see the method&#39;s implementation, without scrolling to the top of the current file or using IDE. Whereas when functions are called from their files, the filenames serve as advertisements for the rest of the codebase. Getting constant reminders of where each function lives makes it more likely that developers will add new code to the right places, rather than putting it in the wrong place or, even worse, duplicating code that already exists.\n  Lines 23 - 30: All of the possible errors the endpoint can return. These are discussed in more detail under  Rule #10.\n  The reason for writing our views this way is that it makes it easy to answer the Five Ws for each endpoint. That is, we can immediately see  who has access to the endpoint,  what input the endpoint accepts,  how that input is sanitized,  where the business logic is performed,  what errors get returned  when things go sideways, and the  why of the endpoint \u2014  what a successful response looks like.\n  Let&#39;s contrast this to an example that&#39;s basically straight from the  tutorial for Django Rest Framework:\n  class User(APIView):\r  def post(self, request):\r  serializer = UserSerializer(data=request.data)\r  if serializer.is_valid():\r  serializer.save()\r  return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\r  return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)\n  There&#39;s no way to know by looking at this who is allowed to access the endpoint, what input the endpoint accepts, whether that input is properly sanitized, what data it returns, what the possible errors are, etc. And it&#39;s not even just a matter of looking at the code for UserSerializer to figure this out; for any real-world application the answers to these questions may well be buried multiple levels deep, and getting adequate answers may take not just hours but days.\n      Call me old fashioned, but I believe that:\r\r Code should be a step-by-step set of instructions that&#39;s meant to be read in order, like a recipe\n  You should be able to understand what code is doing by reading it, or at least have pretty good intuition about what&#39;s happening.\n  Here you&#39;re effectively just using a weird DSL to specify behavior by setting class properties and overriding methods. This makes sense for something like the Django Admin, where you&#39;re just configuring a GUI. But for actual application development, GenericViews are the exact opposite of what good code should be like.\n  There may be some legitimate use cases for writing code like this, e.g. for a hackathon, or a client demo, or any other rapid prototype that won&#39;t be deployed publicly. The problem is that a lot of developers seem to take the fact that this tooling exists as an implicit recommendation that they should be writing production code this way. This issue is then compounded by all tutorials and Stack Overflow answers contributed by folks who may be using their web frameworks merely as fun technical toys, or at least in ways that are wildly different than anything grounded in any sort of business context. Basically GenericViews are best avoided, and overall I think the Django community would benefit from moving them from core Django into a contrib package.\n    There are three different places where you can put business logic in Django: in models or model managers, in forms or serializers, and in services. I&#39;m pretty strongly of the opinion that business logic should only ever go in services. I&#39;ll explain why, but first let&#39;s explain what services are and then walk through an example.\n  A &#39;service&#39; is just a file with a bunch of functions that contain all the business logic related to some part of your app. E.g. for  FWD:Everyone, some services we have are  account_management_service.py,  thread_upload_service.py,  content_discovery_service.py, etc. Each service file usually corresponds closely with a views file, e.g.  account_management_views.py or  thread_upload_views.py. Services live in between the views and the models, so that the request-response lifecycle for each endpoint looks like:\n  The view copies any query parameters or body data into local variables, sanitizes these local variables for security issues, then passes the sanitized variables to a service.\n  The service validates user input (e.g. using serializers), enforces business requirements, performs all business logic, and then returns any output or errors to the views.\n  As an example, let&#39;s look at one possible implementation for  account_management_service.create_account, the service method from the previous section:\n  def create_account(request, sanitized_username, sanitized_email_address, unsafe_password,\r  sanitized_terms_of_service_accepted):\r  \r  fields_to_validate_dict = {\r  &#34;username&#34;: sanitized_username,\r  &#34;email_address&#34;: sanitized_email_address,\r  &#34;password&#34;: unsafe_password,\r  &#34;terms_of_service&#34;: sanitized_terms_of_service_accepted,\r  }\r  \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:44:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale\u00a0instantly.\n   Dan Godfrey  // Development Manager\n We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and talk about the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it\u2019s built-in to every repository. GitHub\u2019s issue tracking is special because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.\n  With GitHub Issues you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emoji, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists you can break big issues into tasks, and then further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.\n       As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a specific methodology are too specific and rigid to flex to whatever the moment demands. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad, just to have the space to think. But then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens and quickly goes stale.\n  The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing, and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.\n       Click the button at the top or bottom of this page to sign up for the Beta. Both your personal account and organizations you own are eligible. Once you are given access to the Beta you will receive an email detailing next steps.\n       You can  share your experience with us. using discussions in our feedback repository. We look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n       Our plan is to continue to bundle GitHub Issues and its new project planning capabilities in our Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise plans at no additional cost.\n       GitHub Enterprise Server support follows our normal cadence of one to two quarters before we enable the functionality on-premises.\n       Once the Beta is enabled on your account, the organization&#39;s projects page will display both projects (classic kanban) and the  new beta projects (with table and custom field) side by side. They will coexist through the summer, with classic projects automatically updating to leverage the new features prior to general availability.\n  It is important to note that at this time there are no migration tools available, both from existing projects or other planning and tracking tools.\n              Our roadmap towards general availability (GA) will evolve, but expect improvements to the core flows and new functionality to be continuously added.

Brad told CNN. &#34;Other people, even some of my siblings, slept eight, nine, 10 hours a night. I just couldn&#39;t do it, it was physically impossible. If you paid me a million dollars to sleep eight hours tonight, I couldn&#39;t.&#34;\n It didn&#39;t seem to matter what time he went to bed, how little sleep he&#39;d had or how tired he was from the day&#39;s activities, both as a child and now, at age 64, Brad said.\n     &#39;I&#39;d get five hours and be done. Up, ready to go,&#34; he said. &#34;I wasn&#39;t groggy, I wasn&#39;t tired, just ready to roll and go.&#34;\n    Brad wasn&#39;t alone. In his large Mormon family of eight kids, his two older brothers Rand and Paul also woke early and suffered no ill effects. In fact, the boys were amazingly productive, driven to wake and immediately tackle life with gusto and high spirits.\n  In the dark, wee hours of those mornings the boys practiced basketball, did homework and hobbies and read everything they could get their hands on.\n  Brad&#39;s older sisters Janice and Kathy also struggled to stay in bed, as did their dad, Vere Johnson.\n &#34;I&#39;m almost certain he was a short sleeper, he always up early in the morning and he had this amazing energy level,&#34; Brad said. &#34;Mom, however, was a normal sleeper. She&#39;d get seven or eight hours.&#34;\n The three youngest members of the family, Todd, Scott, and Rob, also had no trouble snoozing the night away, if their dad or siblings allowed it.\n &#34;I kinda remember being really irritated once in awhile when they&#39;d turn the lights on me,&#34; said 63-year-old Todd Johnson. &#34;I like sleeping.&#34;\n   &#34;I only have four children and nine grandchildren, it&#39;s probably one of the smallest families,&#34; said Brad&#39;s oldest sister, 71-year-old Janice Stauffer.\n &#34;Brad has eight, Paul has nine and my younger sister Kathy has 13 children and 70 grandchildren, but that&#39;s a guesstimate,&#34; said Janice with a chuckle. &#34;When we have family reunions every other year in Utah, it&#39;s a big mob, maybe 200 or 250 people can be there.&#34;\n It was at one of those bi-yearly reunions -- July 4, 2005 to be exact -- when Brad Johnson, his siblings and some of his large, extended family made history. They became one of the first multi-generational families to be tested for what would be later called the &#34;short sleep gene.&#34;\n &#34;It was a big deal for sure and the whole family were very nice and very interested in the science,&#34; said sleep specialist Chris Jones, a professor emeritus of neurology at the University of Utah, who collected the family&#39;s blood and DNA samples.\n  Brad wrote into his journal that night: &#34;For most of the day Dr. Chris Jones and his assistant were there talking with members of the family and taking blood samples for a study he is doing on sleep behavior.\n &#34;We have some bad sleepers in the family \u2014 Dad, Rand, Janice, Paul, me \u2014 and he thinks there may be some things to learn from the family. I hope our family can lead to some solutions to sleep issues for us and others.&#34;\n  The birth of the idea that people might sleep for only five hours and bypass the ill effects of sleep deprivation was sheer &#34;serendipity,&#34; said neurology professor Ying-Hui Fu, who conducts sleep gene research at the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco.\n  Jones and Fu, who was at the University of Utah at the time, had been studying  advanced sleep-phase syndrome, thought to be a rare type of &#34;morning lark.&#34; These were people who would fall asleep by 7 p.m. -- no matter how hard they tried to stay awake -- and get up extremely early, say by 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. A gene appeared to be responsible for that unusual circadian rhythm, and the team  published a  number of papers on it.\n &#34;Nobody had any idea that our sleep actually can be regulated by genetics until we published the first paper,&#34; Fu said.\n  &#34;We went back to look at this one family and we realized they actually don&#39;t go to bed early, they go to bed just like the rest of us,&#34; Fu said. &#34;But they get up very early, which means that they just sleep a few hours.&#34;\n  The hunt was on for more people -- like the Johnsons -- who fit that pattern. By 2009, the team  published their first finding: There was a mutation in the gene DEC2 which caused short sleepers to stay awake longer. Since then, the team has discovered two more genes -- an  ADRB1 mutation and a  NPSR1 mutation -- which alter neurotransmitters in the human brain to create short sleep.\n During each of these studies, the team bred mice with the same genetic mutations to test the gene&#39;s function. The results: Genetically-altered mice also slept for fewer hours, with no negative health effects.\n  As research progressed, the team discovered there were also some positive personality characteristics that came along with the ability to successfully sleep for only five hours. Many short sleepers were ambitious, type A personalities, but also incredibly positive, outgoing and optimistic.\n &#34;They were not just awake, they were driven. It was torture for them to do nothing,&#34; Jones said. &#34;They like to run marathons -- many of our natural short sleepers ran marathons -- including mountain marathons where you go straight up. One of them decided he was going to build a violin, and he did.\n &#34;The drive they have is physical, but also psychological: &#39;I&#39;m gonna do this.&#39; It&#39;s really quite remarkable,&#34; Jones added.\n While these traits did not apply to every short sleeper, Fu said, some 90% to 95% of the people in the studies had these common characteristics, including phenomenal memories.\n  Even the mice in the study shared some of these traits. They were more active and productive than typical mice, and seemed to have better memories, even though they slept less.\n Sleep is the time when the body consolidates memories, and cleanses the brain of neurotoxins. Without the  necessary REM and deep wave sleep that a full eight hours of slumber brings, most people struggle with memory recall, Fu said.\n &#34;Yet mice, and presumably humans with the short sleep gene mutation, remember quite well on little sleep, whereas most people won&#39;t remember much of anything if you deprive them of sleep,&#34; she said.\n Does that mean short sleepers have the secret to packing more of the healing benefits of sleep into less actual sleep time? That&#39;s yet to be uncovered. Brad and his brother Paul were scheduled to be part of a sleep study to examine just that when Covid-19 hit last year.\n     The knowledge that there were genes that explained their unusual sleep habits was a huge relief for the Johnson family. Brad and some of his siblings who were short sleepers had spent years worrying over their &#34;sleep disorder.&#34;\n Sleep recommendations say that children need between eight and 14 hours a day of sleep, depending on their age, while adults are supposed to get a minimum of seven hours.\n &#34;There were decades that I was seriously concerned because it&#39;s not something I can fix. I can&#39;t say, &#39;Ok, I&#39;m going to start getting seven or eight hours.&#39; It&#39;s not possible to do that,&#34; Brad said.\n &#34;I used to feel like my sleep habit was a curse because I fought with it for so long,&#34; said Janice Stauffer. &#34;I kept thinking, &#39;I need more sleep, I need more sleep, it&#39;s two in the morning and I need to go back to sleep,&#39; because you&#39;re told you need eight hours of sleep to be healthy and able to function.&#34;\n   &#34;Just a little,&#34; she said. &#34;I can&#39;t help but think that your body needs to be rejuvenated and if you&#39;re only getting half of the rejuvenation, it&#39;s got to have some effect.\n &#34;But it doesn&#39;t make him cranky and he doesn&#39;t suffer from it,&#34; she added, then admitted: &#34;That&#39;s quite remarkable and I&#39;m a little jealous. I&#39;d love to be as productive as he is.&#34;\n Thankfully, Rosie said she is an &#34;easy sleeper&#34; and not bothered by Brad&#39;s late-to-bed or early-to-rise habits. Nor, she said, did Brad try to impose his sleeping style on she or their children, none of whom are short sleepers.\n That wasn&#39;t the case for all of the siblings. One short sleeper wanted his wife and children to rise and shine with him. Another tried to get her spouse to wake up early and join her on projects.\n &#34;My kids, the most they ever said was that I was really annoying in the morning because I was happy when they didn&#39;t want to be happy, you know? They woke up grumpy and I loved mornings,&#34; Janice said. (None of her children are short sleepers.)\n &#34;I look back now and say, &#39;Oh, your life was so rough! All you had to deal with was your mom&#39;s singing in the morning,&#39;&#34; she added with a laugh.\n  One fascinating finding for the Johnson short sleepers is just how much their personalities mirror the traits that are typically found in others with the same gene.\n  &#34;What I&#39;ve read is the typical short sleeper is a Type A personality, very driven, very positive, and looks at the world in a very optimistic way. That was my dad,&#34; Brad said.\n  &#34;Brad has a remarkable memory and so do his brothers and sisters who have this sleeping gene,&#34; Rose said. &#34;They have some similar traits in that they are very driven people, very motivated to be productive and they do get a lot done.&#34;\n Janice, who was an elementary teacher, spends most of her time with her children and grandchildren, but managed to learn new musical instruments while volunteering as a teacher and doing work for the church.\n &#34;It is a huge part of the Mormon faith to give back,&#34; she said. &#34;Now being a short sleeper doesn&#39;t bother me a bit. I quite enjoy the really early mornings when it&#39;s peaceful and quiet and there&#39;s nobody around. It&#39;s a great thing and if I get five hours, I feel good.&#34;\n Brother Paul holds a high position in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and had two children who carry the short sleep gene, while Brad has been &#34;CFO of several large companies and has held a bunch of church leadership positions,&#34; Todd said.\n &#34;It&#39;s a culture, a lifestyle,&#34; Brad said. &#34;You&#39;re here to do good. You&#39;re here to take the gifts that God gave you and use those to help others, so it&#39;s not unusual to see high achievement.&#34;\n Brad sees his short sleep gene as a genetic bonus, allowing him tackle the &#34;hundred things I wanted to do&#34; by giving him an extra two or three hours each day.\n &#34;Exercise has been big in my life,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ve run a lot of marathons. Reading, studying, correspondence, writing -- all those things are great to do early in the morning or late at night.\n   &#34;I am rarely, rarely ever tired during the day. I never take naps,&#34; Brad said. &#34;This gene has allowed me to be in some demanding roles and positions. It&#39;s given me these additional hours each day that I can do things that I love, be with people I love.\n  Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series.

He asked about the\u00a0 the lack of updates to the Raspberry Pi 4\u2019s USB-C power schematics for this board. You may recall that the USB-C power issue was  covered by us back in July of 2019, yet the current official\u00a0  Raspberry Pi 4 schematics still show the flawed implementation, with the shorted CC pins, nearly two years later.\n [Alasdair Allan], responsible for the Raspberry Pi\u00a0 documentation, mentioned that they\u2019re in the process of moving their documentation from  Markdown to AsciiDoc, and said that they wouldn\u2019t have time for new changes until that was done. But then [James Hughes], Principal Software Engineer at Raspberry Pi,\u00a0 mentioned that the schematics may not be updated even after this change due to a of lack of manpower.\n As [James] emphasized, their hardware will probably never be open, due to NDAs signed with Broadcom. The compromise solution has always been to publish limited peripheral schematics. Yet now even those limited schematics may not keep up with board revisions.\n An easy fix for the Raspberry Pi 4\u2019s schematics would be for someone in the community to reverse-engineer the exact changes made to the Raspberry Pi 4 board layout and mark these up in a revised schematic. This should be little more than the addition of a second 5.1 k\u03a9 resistor, so that CC1 and CC2 each are connected to ground via their own resistor, instead of being shorted together.\n Still, you might wish that Raspberry Pi would update the schematics for you, especially since they  have updated versions internally.

With restaurant profit margins typically low to begin with, many complained that these app startups were gouging them and eating up what little money they might be making on each order, all in the name of convenience.\n San Francisco became one of the first U.S. cities to set a cap on what the apps could charge restaurants when Mayor London Breed  passed an emergency order last April capping the commission fees at 15 percent.\n &#34;In these tough financial circumstances, every dollar counts and can make the difference between a restaurant staying open, or shuttering,&#34; Breed said at the time.\n In Tuesday&#39;s vote, the Board of Supervisors makes the fee cap permanent, with Supervisors Ahsha Safa\u00ed and Aaron Peskin having led the charge. The legislation, which will still get a second vote and may get further amended, allows the app companies to charge extra fees for enhanced services \u2014 such as marketing services that give more prominent placement to a restaurant within an app. But the per-order fee will be capped at 15 percent.\n  &#34;We are happy to have worked with Supervisor Peskin and his staff on this important legislation to set a permanent cap on the delivery commission fees that third party delivery companies place on restaurants in San Francisco. This legislation is well thought out, allowing the ability for restaurant operators to sign a completely separate marketing agreement for additional services, while ensuring that a clear 15% cap will remain on the delivery service. \u00a0This legislation will help ensure our San Francisco restaurants can continue to operate in a financially sustainable way as they recover from the past year plus with limited capacity and lost revenue.&#34;\n  Multiple municipalities and states passed temporary, emergency legislation capping delivery commission fees during the pandemic, but most of these were set to expire after restaurants were allowed to more fully reopen.\n The California legislature failed to pass a permanent 15-percent cap on these fees, which had been championed by San Diego Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez. Instead, back in May, the  Assembly passed AB286, which simply requires more transparency in these fees from the app providers \u2014 showing customers and restaurants exactly who is being charged what in every transaction.\n Temporary caps set by other states, including New York State \u2014 which capped delivery commissions at 15% and marketing fees at 5% \u2014 are set to expire, and legislation to make them permanent still has not passed in most cases.\n The Wall Street Journal  covered the conflict in April, noting that while many restaurants and consumers have come to rely on the apps, many restaurants are &#34;tiring&#34; of paying exorbitant fees.\n The major three \u2014 GrubHub, DoorDash, and UberEats \u2014 have so far declined to comment on San Francisco&#39;s new legislation,  as the Chronicle notes.\n Comments on pending legislation around the country from the apps themselves has tended to focus on the impact on the consumer, saying they&#39;ll have to raise prices if their ability to charge commissions is capped.\n &#34;DoorDash has always supported restaurants,&#34; reads one such statement from earlier this year. &#34;Pricing regulations could cause us to increase costs for customers, which could lead to fewer orders for local restaurants and fewer earning opportunities for Dashers.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:42:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,\u9910\u5385,francisco,\u9910\u9986", "title": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6c38\u4e45\u5730\u5c06\u9910\u5385\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5e94\u7528\u8d39\u7528\u4e3a15\uff05 ", "title_en": "San Francisco Permanently Caps Delivery App Fees for Restaurants at 15%", "transed": 1, "url": "https://sfist.com/2021/06/23/san-francisco-permanently-caps-delivery-app-fees-at-15/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "\u9910\u5385", "francisco", "\u9910\u9986"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0b08335031c70e9a38d3479b0bec3e29.jpg", "infoid": 1067772, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\uff06\uff0334;

to highlight companies that have increased dividends and reduced outstanding shares for 10 consecutive years or more.\n (On a dual-axis time series chart, the trend-line of the share count and the trend-line of the dividend rate intersect to create an \u201cX&#34; shape.)\n There are at least 18 companies that meet my strictest criteria for inclusion, summarized as:\n    A hypothetical $100,000 portfolio invested equally amongst these companies in June 2011 would be presently valued at more than $750,000, assuming that dividends were reinvested (and notwithstanding the impact of taxes and trading fees).\u2020\n  I believe that a basket of companies using free cash flow growth to pay an increasing dividend and to simultaneously reduce the number of outstanding shares may outperform the broader stock market because of two complementary factors:\n   *In a shareholder&#39;s utopia, all share repurchases would result in fewer outstanding shares, yet this is rarely the case. Many companies use stock buybacks to mitigate executive compensation that is paid out in stock options or restricted stock units. Other companies issue new shares to fund dividend payments.\n  To make the X Factor Index suitable for the majority of investors, it may be necessary to broaden the stock selection criteria while attempting to avoid the dilution of investment returns. (Equity index funds can hold hundreds or thousands of stocks to diversify capital and to protect the investor from an over-concentration in a small number of securities.)\n   This loosened criterion would allow a stock to qualify for the index even if the parent company had a one year &#34;blip&#34; where outstanding shares increased (like Apple) or a multi-year stretch where outstanding shares remained constant (like Church &amp; Dwight).\n Another method is to maintain the strict criteria using a time horizon that is less than 10 years. This may result in higher returns if it allows the investor to &#34;get in early&#34; on a fundamental trend.\n  \u2020 Each of the companies above qualifies for inclusion in the X Factor Index as of this writing, however, this may not have been the case in June 2011. Therefore, the hypothetical 10-year performance of the portfolio above is potentially misleading. Additionally, past performance does not guarantee future results.

", "note_en": "(CNN)Covid-19 deaths have fallen dramatically across the United States -- average daily deaths are less than a tenth of what they were at the peak of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- but nearly 300 people are still dying of Covid-19 each day in the US.\n  People who died of Covid-19 in May were younger and more disproportionately Black than those who had died of Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, a CNN analysis of CDC data shows.\n     And Americans who are still dying of Covid-19 are &#34;overwhelmingly&#34; unvaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n    &#34;This is exactly what we would expect, given ongoing inequities in vaccine access and a smaller proportion of younger people having been protected by vaccination,&#34; William Hanage, a member of Harvard University&#39;s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and associate professor of epidemiology, told CNN.\n  Deaths are a lagging indicator of disease, following weeks and sometimes months behind initial Covid-19 diagnosis, experts say.\n &#34;For May, we might be looking at a group of individuals diagnosed in March or April, or in some cases even February,&#34; during a time when the US was still prioritizing older adults and those with certain comorbidities to be vaccinated, Dr. Judith O&#39;Donnell, hospital epidemiologist and director of infection prevention and control at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, told CNN.\n People 75 and older have accounted for about 57% of all Covid-19 deaths in the US, but the balance was shifted in May, with 59% of deaths among those under the age of 75 for that month, CDC data shows.\n Instead, those between the ages of 50 and 64 have represented a significantly larger share of deaths recently. In May, about a quarter of deaths occurred in this age group, compared to 16% of total deaths throughout the pandemic.\n And adults under 40 represented about 3% of Covid-19 deaths in May, more than double their share of total deaths since the pandemic began.\n  O&#39;Donnell, who has cared for inpatients with Covid-19, says there is a &#34;striking difference&#34; in the people she&#39;s treated over the past couple of months compared to a year ago, with the average age of hospitalized patients now  two decades younger than it was.\n But it&#39;s not just about age, she said. The same comorbidities -- including heart failure, kidney failure, obesity and history of smoking -- put people of all ages at higher risk, although vaccinations are making a difference.\n &#34;We&#39;re very rarely seeing the older population hospitalized and I think it&#39;s because they heard the vaccine message, rolled up their sleeves and, in most cases, got vaccinated early on,&#34; O&#39;Donnell said.\n &#34;The 18 to 29 group is really undervaccinated right now, and if it stays that way, we&#39;re going to see them accounting for a greater share of hospitalizations and deaths as time goes on.&#34;\n  Black people have also represented a larger share of Covid-19 deaths recently, as well as lower vaccination coverage, CDC data shows.\n  Throughout the pandemic, Black people have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, accounting for about 12.5% of the population but more than 15% of total deaths, according to CDC data.\n That disparity was even larger in May, with nearly 19% of Covid-19 deaths throughout the month among Black people. In recent weeks, Black people and American Indians have been more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic White people to die of Covid-19, CDC data shows.\n Indeed, Black people are the most undervaccinated racial or ethnic group in the US. More than 45% of the US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, but coverage among Black people is less than half of that, at about 22%.\n &#34;These lower rates may be due in part, to vaccine hesitancy, but they may also be due to inequities in vaccine access,&#34; Dr. Lisa Cooper, founder of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity, told CNN. &#34;Many African Americans in the South live in rural areas with limited access to health care facilities. Furthermore, many people may have other stressors related to housing, food, or job insecurity, which may be preventing them from getting vaccinated.&#34;\n Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n The share of Covid-19 deaths among Asian and Hispanic people, however, decreased in May and both groups were underrepresented in their share of Covid-19 deaths relative to their share of the population.\n While vaccination coverage among Hispanic people also lags the US average -- about 25% overall -- rates have been increasing for this group over recent weeks, CDC data shows. And Asian people recently surpassed non-Hispanic White people in terms of vaccination coverage and have had one of the lowest death rates throughout the pandemic.\n &#34;Health equity plays into this because as we have learned over the past year, we are not safe until we are all safe,&#34; Cooper said. &#34;As long as some people in our society don&#39;t have what they need to stay healthy, we are all at risk of the infection spreading, overwhelming our health systems and leading to lockdowns that harm all of us through their negative effects of our psychological and social well-being, our physical health and our economic stability.&#34;\n   Experts stress that continued vaccination efforts are critical to stop the spread of the virus and prevent more deaths.\n &#34;As more Americans have rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated, we have chipped away at the ability of the Covid-19 virus to cause more illness and more suffering,&#34; Walensky said. &#34;This new virus forced too many of our families to accept death as its outcome for too many of our loved ones, but now, this should not be the case.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:41:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "deaths,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u968f\u7740Covid Deaths\u547d\u4e2d\u4f4e\u70b9\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u66f4\u5e74\u8f7b ", "title_en": "As Covid deaths hit lows, new deaths are younger with more Blacks than before", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/health/covid-deaths-shifting-younger-more-disparities/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["deaths", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "847dafa55d7084b20b83435982c6921e.jpg", "infoid": 1067769, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5468\u4e8c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u6263\u62bc\u4e8633\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u7531\u4f0a\u6717\u653f\u5e9c\u5206\u652f\u673a\u6784\u7ecf\u8425\uff0c\u57282020\u5e74\u603b\u7edf\u9009\u4e3e\u4e4b\u524d\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u5949\u884c\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fd8\u6263\u62bc\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u6050\u6016\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd0\u8425\u3002\n \u6628\u5929\u53f8\u6cd5\u5ba3\u5e03\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u957f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f0a\u6717\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u5e7f\u64ad\u7535\u89c6\uff08IRTVU\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8633\u4e2a\u4f0a\u6717\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u7531\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u9769\u547d\u536b\u961f\u961f\u4f0d\uff08IRGC-QF\uff09\u62e5\u6709\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u3002 Doj\u8868\u793aIrtvu\uff06\uff0334;\u9488\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8bfd\u8c24\u7ade\u9009\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u52a8\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \uff06\uff0334;\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4f0a\u6717\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5982\u65b0\u95fb\u7535\u89c6\u548cAl-Alam\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5e7f\u64ad\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e5f\u95e8\u7684Al-Masirah\u7535\u89c6\u9891\u9053\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u5ba3\u5e03\u7f51\u7ad9\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u5355\u9875\u9648\u8ff0;\u5df2\u88ab\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u6263\u62bc\uff06\uff0339;\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8054\u90a6\u8c03\u67e5\u5c40\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u52a1\u90e8\u7684\u6d77\u8c79\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

", "note_en": "On Tuesday, the US government said it seized 33 websites run by a branch of the Iranian government that spread disinformation in the US before the 2020 presidential election. The US also seized three websites that it said were operated by an Iraqi terrorist organization.\n Yesterday&#39;s  Department of Justice announcement said the 33 Iranian sites were used by the Iranian Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU), which is owned or controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF). The DOJ said the IRTVU &#34;targeted the United States with disinformation campaigns and malign influence operations.&#34;\n &#34;Visitors to leading Iranian media sites like  Press TV and Al-Alam, the country&#39;s main English- and Arabic-language broadcasters, as well as the Al-Masirah TV channel of Yemen&#39;s Huthis, were met with single-page statements declaring the website &#39;has been seized by the United States government&#39; accompanied by the seals of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Commerce Department,&#34; the  AFP wrote. The US\u00a0also &#34;took over the domain name of the news website Palestine Today, which reflects the viewpoints of Gaza-based Islamic militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad,&#34; The Washington Post  reported.\n The US obtained seizure warrants and was able to shut down the sites because the domains were provided by a US company.\n  In October 2020, the Treasury Department&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  sanctioned IRTVU, IRGC-QF, and three other Iranian entities &#34;for attempting to influence elections in the United States.&#34; The sanction announcement described IRTVU as &#34;a propaganda arm of the IRGC-QF.&#34;\n    &#34;The Iranian regime has targeted the United States&#39; electoral process with brazen attempts to sow discord among the voting populace by spreading disinformation online and executing malign influence operations aimed at misleading US voters,&#34; the October 2020 announcement said. &#34;Components of the Government of Iran, disguised as news organizations or media outlets, have targeted the United States in order to subvert US democratic processes.&#34;\n Iranian disinformation campaigns &#34;have targeted a global audience through a variety of covert media organizations&#34; and &#34;focus on sowing discord among readers via social media platforms and messaging applications, and frequently involve mischaracterizing information,&#34; the Treasury Department said.\n &#34;IRGC-QF outlets amplified false narratives in English and posted disparaging propaganda articles and other US-oriented content with the intent to sow discord among US audiences,&#34; the sanction announcement also said.\n The Anti-Defamation League\u00a0 said in 2015 that &#34;Press TV is the Iranian government&#39;s primary English-language propaganda tool, promoting a wide range of pernicious antisemitic conspiracy theories as &#39;news&#39; to a worldwide audience. Operated by the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Press TV serves as a mouthpiece for American anti-Semites, conspiracy theorists, and Holocaust deniers, who help amplify the Iranian regime&#39;s hateful messages.&#34;\n Press TV &#34;push[ed] antisemitic conspiracies about the coronavirus to distract from the mullah regime&#39;s mishandling of the pandemic,&#34; for example by claiming that &#34;Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran,&#34; the Jerusalem Post  wrote in March 2020.\n  The October sanctions classified IRTVU as a Specially Designated National (SDN), meaning it is &#34;prohibited from obtaining services, including website and domain services, in the United States without an OFAC license,&#34; the DOJ said yesterday.\n &#34;The 33 [seized] domains are owned by a United States company. IRTVU did not obtain a license from OFAC prior to utilizing the domain names,&#34; the DOJ said. The DOJ did not identify the US company.\n    Because of the sanctions, all of the designated entities&#39; &#34;property and interests&#34; that are &#34;subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,&#34; the Treasury Department said in October.\n The other three websites seized yesterday were operated by Kata&#39;ib Hizballah (KH), which is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US government. As with IRTVU, KH&#39;s domains &#34;were owned by a United States company&#34; and &#34;KH did not obtain a license from OFAC prior to utilizing the domain names,&#34; the DOJ said.\n KH, which is backed by Iran, launched attacks against US and coalition forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2011. &#34;KH returned its focus to opposing US presence in Iraq&#34; in late 2018 when it &#34;allegedly conducted a rocket attack that took place near the US Consulate in Basra, which was evacuated and indefinitely closed,&#34;  according to Stanford University&#39;s Center for International Security and Cooperation. After that attack and another rocket attack on the US embassy in Baghdad that was carried out by a related group, the US &#34;issued a statement that it would consider attacks carried out by Iranian-backed militias as attacks perpetrated by Iran.&#34;\n  The Iranian government condemned the website seizures, and President Hassan Rouhani&#39;s chief of staff said the US action is &#34;not constructive when talks for a deal on the nuclear issue are under way,&#34;  according to AFP.\u00a0IRIB &#34;accused the US of repressing freedom of expression and joining forces with Israel and Saudi Arabia &#39;to block pro-resistance media outlets exposing the crimes of US allies in the region,&#39;&#34; the AFP wrote.\n The seizures did not erase the Iranian organizations&#39; presence on the Internet. &#34;TV stations such as Press TV and Al-Alam switched to .ir domains and their websites remained accessible. They are also still present on social media, mainly Twitter, and their broadcasts have continued uninterrupted,&#34; the AFP wrote. Additionally, &#34;Al-Masirah quickly established a new website, using its name but swapping the .net domain for .com.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:01:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u56fd\u8425,state", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6263\u62bc33\u5c4a\u4f0a\u6717\u56fd\u8425\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7ad9\u88ab\u6307\u63a7\u9009\u4e3e\u7981\u4ee4 ", "title_en": "US seizes 33 Iranian state-run media sites accused of election disinformation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/us-seizes-33-iranian-state-run-media-sites-accused-of-election-disinformation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u56fd\u8425", "state"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "23b606564728a0865a7729d351286494.png", "infoid": 1067767, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u9c9c\u8d2d\u4e70\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u5927\u7684\u91c7\u8d2d\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u6536\u8d2d\u7684\u6536\u8d2dGlu Mobile\uff0c\u5468\u4e09\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4ee514\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8d2d\u4e70\u534e\u7eb3\u5144\u5f1f\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4Playdex\u3002\u66fc\u5f7b\u65af\u7279\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u56e0\u5176\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u201c\u9ad8\u5c14\u592b\u51b2\u7a81\u201d\u800c\u95fb\u540d\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc78000\u4e07\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5168\u7403\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3002\n \u5f53\u65f6\u72c2\u70ed\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u5730\u88ab\u629b\u5f03\u4e86430\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8b66\u544a\u5144\u5f1f\u6e38\u620f\u5e08\u5c06\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684430\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8b66\u62a5\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u63a2\u7d22\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u88ab\u629b\u5f03\u3002\n   \u7535\u5b50\u827a\u672f\u662f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u578b\u897f\u90e8\u7535\u5b50\u6e38\u620f\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a400\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u684c\u9762\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u6743\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6218\u573a\uff0c\u661f\u7403\u5927\u6218\u548c\u6cf0\u5766\u666e\u5229\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u5230\u516c\u53f8\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4fdd\u6301\u6b65\u4f10\uff0c\u5982\u6fc0\u8fdb\u66b4\u96ea\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e89\u593a2016\u5e74\u7684\u56fd\u738b\u6536\u8d2d\u3002\n \u7535\u5b50\u827a\u672f\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8d2d\u4e70\u72c2\u6b22\uff0c\u622a\u81f32021\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e09\u5927\u6536\u8d2d\u4ef7\u503c\u7ea650\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 ", "note_en": "Fresh off the $2.4 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile this past April, their biggest purchase to date, Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that they are buying Warner Bros.

It\u2019s believed to be the first time a national law enforcement group carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group.\n The Ukrainian police also claimed at the time to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang. But it doesn\u2019t seem the operation was completely successful.\n  While the Clop operation fell silent following the arrests, the gang has this week published a fresh batch of confidential data which it claims to have stolen from two new victims \u2014 a farm equipment retailer and an architects office \u2014 on its dark web site, seen by TechCrunch.\n If true \u2014 and neither of the alleged victims responded to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment \u2014 this would suggest that the ransomware gang remains active, despite last week\u2019s first-of-its-kind law enforcement sting. This is likely because the suspects cuffed included only those who played a lesser role in the Clop operation.  Cybersecurity firm Intel 471 said  it believes that last week\u2019s arrests targeted the money laundering portion of the operation, with core members of the gang not apprehended.\n \u201cWe do not believe that any core actors behind Clop were apprehended,\u201d the security company said. \u00a0\u201cThe overall impact to Clop is expected to be minor although this law enforcement attention may result in the Clop brand getting abandoned as we\u2019ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and Babuk.\u201d\n Clop appears to still be in business, but it remains to be seen how long the group will remain operational. Not only have law enforcement operations dealt numerous blows to ransomware groups this year, such as U.S. investigators\u2019 recent recovery of millions in  cryptocurrency they claim was paid in ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers, but Russia has this week confirmed it will begin to work with the U.S. to locate cybercriminals.\n Russia has until now taken a hands-off approach when it comes to dealing with hackers.  Reuters reported Wednesday that the head of the country\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov was quoted as saying it will co-operate with U.S. authorities on future cybersecurity operations.\n Intel 471 previously said that it does not believe the key members of Clop were arrested in last week\u2019s operation because \u201cthey are probably living in Russia,\u201d which has long provided safe harbor to cybercriminals by refusing to take action.\n The Clop ransomware gang was first spotted in early 2019, and the group has since been linked to a number of high-profile attacks. These include the breach of  U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm in April 2020 and the recent data breach at  Accellion, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider\u2019s software to steal data from dozens of its customers including the\u00a0University of Colorado and cloud security vendor Qualys.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:00:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "TechCrunch recently sat down with  Leading Investor from  Well Known Firm to chat about their investing theses, the state of today\u2019s venture capital market, and why prices are so high for early-stage startups.\n We\u2019ve been hunting down Leading Investor for some time, so it\u2019s great to get their thoughts on today\u2019s startup market and the larger venture capital industry. Let\u2019s have some fun!\n  TechCrunch: To kick things off, the early-stage startup market has been super active lately. How has the accelerating cadence of deal-making impacted how you and Well Known Firm invest?\n Leading Investor: We\u2019ve made no changes to our process. Everyone who has is weak of conviction and poor of wallet.\n TC: Got it, got it. The rapid-fire, early-stage market, though, does seem expensive at times. At least compared to historical norms. Are you worried about overpaying for nascent startup shares?\n LI: Every deal that we\u2019ve been a part of has been fairly priced. Every deal that we didn\u2019t win was overpriced. Every deal we didn\u2019t see was stupid.\n TC: Cool. Sure. Let\u2019s talk about the technology market more generally. Where are you seeing the most startup opportunity? Or perhaps more simply, where are you paying the most attention today for future deals?\n LI: Please consult our portfolio page. Here is a name of a startup we\u2019ve backed. Here\u2019s another. Those are the hot areas and the hot companies. All other areas are ice-cold, overpriced, and generally over-hyped.\n  LI: Let me cut you off there to name drop Eric from Zoom, with whom I have a great relationship. Salesforce. Snowflake. On-demand pricing. Historical Twilio reference. Also have you read Recently Published Book? Someone gave me a copy and I read the dust cover. Books are good. I read them.\n TC: Right. Turning to the venture capital market, how competitive is Well Known Firm these days? Other firms are offering more services in addition to capital than you are. Does that impact your win rate in competitive deals?\n LI: Our firm\u2019s services are real and impactful and accretive. Other VCs offer services but don\u2019t deliver. You have to deliver. Delivery is key. We\u2019re like the AWS of service delivery. Except free. We only demand the right to profit from founder success while enriching ourselves as the cost of our fine, free services.\n TC: All right. Let\u2019s talk about the exit market. We\u2019ve seen a pretty active IPO market, and TechCrunch has heard that SPACs are getting incredibly frisky, even pinging Series B-funded companies in case they want to go public. What\u2019s your take on that?\n LI: Here\u2019s a generic answer that doesn\u2019t answer your question but ensures that my portfolio companies continue to receive all possible inbound in case we need to float a company that won\u2019t make it as a venture-backed, private company. Public investors are dumb and will happily hold our bags. They are the valets of the investing world.\n TC: Last question, how are returns at your firm? You\u2019ve raised successively larger funds over the years. Is your IRR holding up as you\u2019ve taken more capital under management?\n LI: Recall that Well Known Firm invested in Very Old Company, so our returns have historically been strong. Regarding Every Deal Since Then, it\u2019s a bit too soon to tell. But recall Very Old Company that did well. That\u2019s how we do things at Well Known Firm.\n TC: Sorry one more before we let you go. Your firm still only has male partners and nearly all of them are white.

Carriers and fleets can pay a per-mile subscription fee to access it. The company includes carriers Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport, and companies Anheuser-Busch InBev and HP Inc., amongst its partners.\n Carriers purchase trucks with compatible hardware directly from OEMs, so Embark says it has designed its system to be \u201cplatform agnostic\u201d across multiple components and manufacturers. The company says its software can simulate up to 1,200 60-second scenarios per second, and make adaptive predictions using those scenarios for the behaviour of other vehicles on the road.\n  Embark said in an investor presentation for the SPAC deal that it was targeting \u201cdriver-out,\u201d or operating on roads without a safety driver, by 2023 and launching at a commercial scale across the American sunbelt the following year. However, Embark still has technical milestones yet to achieve, noting in the presentation that the software still needs to accomplish actions such as interactions with emergency vehicles, and responding to blown tires and other mechanical failures.\n  Upon closing, the transaction will inject Embark with around $615 million in gross cash proceeds, including $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from investors including CPP Investments, Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.\n Embark also said former Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was joining its board, likely a boon for a company operating in the autonomous trucking industry, which is still only authorized for commercial deployment in 24 states.\n Embark was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak, who worked together on autonomous driving while completing engineering degrees from Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo. After launching out of Y Combinator, the company quickly went on to raise $117 million in total funding, including a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global Management.\n The transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2021. The company joins competitor AV trucking developer Plus in going public via a SPAC merger.
