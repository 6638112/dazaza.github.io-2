Far more about this period in his life can be learned from Clark’s book. After his first year, Haldane gained a First in maths. He also became a published co-author, having contributed some mathematical analysis to a paper he and his father wrote for the  Journal of Physiology. He was much happier at Oxford than at Eton and made several good friends, including Aldous Huxley and Dick Mitchison, who was to marry Jack’s younger sister, Naomi. (She went on to publish more than 90 books, including works of historical fiction and fantasy, and became as well known as her celebrated brother.) For his second year, Haldane switched from mathematics to Greats. This might seem an odd thing to do, but, as Clark says, “the companionship of the classics was to be a solace in an otherwise aesthetically bleak life”. It also taught him “to write clearly, comprehensibly and with an economy that was to serve him well”. The plan was to switch to physiology after Greats, but when, on 4 August 1914, Haldane learned he had graduated with a First, the news was, as he later put it, “somewhat overshadowed by other events”. Haldane, who had been an enthusiastic member of the Officers’ Training Corps at Oxford, volunteered for the army as soon as war was declared, asking to serve with the Scottish regiment, the Black Watch. His wish was granted and, after four months of training, he was posted to France as a lieutenant with the regiment’s First Battalion. He was made the battalion’s trench mortar officer, leading small groups of men to throw hand-bombs into enemy trenches. Though it was dangerous and frightening, he had never been happier. He had always enjoyed explosions, and now he discovered that he found coming under fire and attacking others thrilling. “I was well aware,” he later wrote, “that I might die in these flat, featureless fields, and that a huge waste of human values was going on there. Nevertheless, I found the experience enjoyable.” He was popular with the men and with his superior officers. General Haig, no less, described him as “the bravest and dirtiest officer in my army”. [see also:  Hermione Lee on how to write a life] From the Western Front, Haldane kept up a correspondence with Naomi about experiments they were conducting together on the genetics of mice. The result was a jointly authored paper that appeared in the  Journal of Genetics, making him, he boasted, “the only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward position of the Black Watch”. After being injured by artillery fire, Haldane was sent back to Scotland, where he set up a Bombing School to teach Black Watch soldiers how to use grenades. In the autumn of 1916, he was sent to Mesopotamia. There he was wounded by a British bomb, keeping him out of active service for the rest of the war. He spent the last two years of it in India, where he was sent to recuperate. By the time he returned home, he had acquired a deep and abiding love of the country, its people and its culture. Before the end of the war, Haldane had been offered a fellowship at New College, Oxford, which he took up in 1919. There he lectured on physiology, which he had never formally studied himself. Four years later he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, as reader in biochemistry. In that position he published important work on enzymes, but his research became increasingly focused on using mathematics to address problems in theoretical genetics. The results of this research are contained in a series of ten papers, “Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection”, which he published between 1924 and 1934 and which many scientists regard as his most important work. It was in these papers that he provided his solution to the problem of how to incorporate Mendelian genetics into Darwin’s theory of evolution. Gregor Mendel, now recognised as the founder of the science of genetics, died in 1884 in relative obscurity. Only in the 20th century was the importance of his investigations of the rules of heredity acknowledged. In 1886, he published the results of his painstaking observations on the inherited characteristics of pea plants of various heights, pod shapes, seed colours, etc. He discovered that if you cross breed, say, a yellow pea plant with a green one, then the resulting plants will all be yellow. However, in the next generation, there will be a mixture of three yellow plants to every green one. This gave rise to the theory of “recessive” and “dominant” traits, familiar now to every school student of biology. The problem Haldane tackled was how to incorporate this theory into Darwin’s theory of natural selection. What he provided was a piece of mathematics that modelled Mendel’s laws of heredity and the Darwinian notion of “the survival of the fittest”. The biologist Julian Huxley (brother of Aldous and friend of Haldane) named this solution “the modern synthesis”. **** During this period, Haldane began his career as a populariser of science. His slim book,  Daedalus, or Science and the Future, was published in 1924 and was a huge success, going through five impressions in its first year. Among its most enthusiastic readers was a young married woman called Charlotte Burghes, who was writing a novel set in a world in which the human race would be able to choose the sex of its children. She wanted to meet Haldane to discuss whether the science in her novel was plausible. Receiving no reply to a letter she sent, she went straight to Trinity to interview him. Within a year, she divorced her husband and married Haldane. So began a new era in Haldane’s life in which politics played an increasingly important part. His and Charlotte’s home became a meeting place for liberal and socialist students and staff, and, encouraged by Charlotte, Haldane became increasingly left wing. In 1928, they visited the Soviet Union, where Haldane became friends with Nikolai Vavilov, later one of Lysenko’s victims. On his return, Haldane spoke with great warmth about the USSR, though he did not join the Communist Party until 1942. In 1933, Haldane moved from Cambridge to University College London to become its professor of genetics (later professor of biometry). In the same year, Hitler became chancellor of Germany. “I began to realise,” Haldane later wrote, “that even if professors leave politics alone, politics won’t leave professors alone.” As the 1930s wore on, he was pushed further into politics and yet further to the left. During the Spanish Civil War, he advised the republicans on precautions against gas attack and visited the front as an observer, seeing for himself the devastating effects of air raids. In 1937, he became the science correspondent of the  Daily Worker. Between then and 1950 he contributed nearly 350 articles, mixing scientific popularisation with propaganda. Subramanian is evidently very interested in Haldane’s politics, but he does not quite succeed in making sense of them. Perhaps no sense can be made of them. Perhaps it will forever remain a mystery why someone as intelligent and critical as Haldane would declare allegiance to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, even after the purges, the show trials, the non-aggression pact with the Nazis, the attacks on scientists and the repression of freedom. We should, however, bear in mind that he was only a member of the party for eight years. He was not, as is often said, an apologist for Lysenko. On the contrary, the Lysenko affair clearly shook him. Largely because of it, he distanced himself from communism after 1948 and left the party altogether in 1950. He remained fiercely left wing, however, and in 1956 he announced publicly that, together with his second wife Helen, he was leaving Britain for India because of the Suez Crisis. This was not the real reason. Neither was it true, as he said later, that he was settling in India in order to be free of the tyranny of wearing socks (“60 years in socks is enough”). He was drawn to India because of its socialism, its culture and its climate. He died there in 1964 of a cancer that he immortalised in a poem entitled “Cancer’s a Funny Thing” which Subramanian reproduces in full, beginning: “I wish I had the voice of Homer/To sing of rectal carcinoma.” For all its faults, Subramanian’s biography does allow Haldane’s booming voice to be heard, and, for all Haldane’s faults, it remains a voice worth listening to.  A Dominant Character: The

Mitchison)，他们即将迎娶杰克的妹妹娜奥米(Naomi)。(她后来出版了90多本书，包括历史小说和奇幻作品，并与她著名的哥哥一样出名。)。在他的第二年，霍尔丹从数学转到了伟大的学科。这似乎是一件奇怪的事情，但正如克拉克所说，“与经典作品相伴，是在原本黯淡的生活中的一种慰藉。”它还教会了他“写作要清晰、通俗易懂，并且要有一个对他有利的经济”。原计划是继伟人之后转行生理学，但在1914年8月4日，当霍尔丹得知自己以第一名毕业时，用他后来的话说，这个消息“多少被其他事件盖过了风头”。霍尔丹曾是牛津军官训练团的一名热情成员，战争一宣战，他就自愿参军，要求加入苏格兰黑色守望团(Black Watch)。他的愿望实现了，经过四个月的训练，他被派往法国，成为该团第一营的中尉。他被任命为该营的战壕迫击炮军官，带领一小群人向敌人的战壕投掷手榴弹。虽然这很危险，也很可怕，但他从来没有这么开心过。他一直喜欢爆炸，现在他发现受到攻击和攻击令人毛骨悚然。“我很清楚，”他后来写道，“我可能会死在这些平淡无奇的田野里，那里正在发生着对人类价值的巨大浪费。”尽管如此，我还是觉得这段经历令人愉快。“。他在士兵和他的上级军官中很受欢迎。黑格将军形容他是“我军队里最勇敢、最肮脏的军官”。[另见：赫敏·李谈如何写人生]来自西线的霍尔丹一直与娜奥米保持通信，讨论他们共同进行的老鼠遗传学实验。其结果是一篇发表在《遗传学》杂志上的合著论文，他夸口说，这使他成为“唯一一位站在黑色守望者前沿完成科学论文的军官”。在炮火中受伤后，霍尔丹被送回苏格兰，在那里他建立了一所轰炸学校，教黑卫队士兵如何使用手榴弹。1916年秋，他被派往美索不达米亚。在那里，他被一枚英国炸弹炸伤，使他在战争剩下的时间里无法现役。他在印度度过了最后两年，在那里他被送去疗养。到他回国时，他已经对这个国家、这个国家的人民和这个国家的文化产生了深深的、持久的热爱。战争结束前，霍尔丹获得了牛津大学新学院的奖学金，他于1919年开始工作。他在那里讲授生理学，这是他自己从未正式学习过的。四年后，他转到剑桥三一学院(Trinity College)，担任生物化学专业的讲师。在这一职位上，他发表了有关酶的重要研究成果，但他的研究越来越专注于利用数学来解决理论遗传学中的问题。这项研究的结果包含在他在1924年至1934年间发表的十篇系列论文《自然选择理论的数学贡献》中，许多科学家认为这是他最重要的工作。正是在这些论文中，他为如何将孟德尔遗传学融入达尔文进化论的问题提供了解决方案。格雷戈尔·孟德尔(Gregor Mendel)现在被公认为遗传学的创始人，他于1884年在相对默默无闻的情况下去世。直到20世纪，他对遗传法则的研究的重要性才得到承认。1886年，他发表了他对不同高度、豆荚形状、种子颜色等豌豆植株遗传特性的艰苦观察结果。他发现，如果你将一株黄色的豌豆与一株绿色的豌豆杂交，那么产生的植株都将是黄色的。然而，在下一代，每种绿色植物将混合三种黄色植物。这就产生了“隐性”和“显性”特征理论，这是现在每个生物学校的学生都熟悉的。霍尔丹解决的问题是如何将这一理论融入达尔文的自然选择理论。他提供的是一个数学模型，它模拟了孟德尔的遗传定律和达尔文的“适者生存”的概念。生物学家朱利安·赫胥黎(奥尔德斯的兄弟，霍尔丹的朋友)将这种解决方案命名为“</p></div><div
