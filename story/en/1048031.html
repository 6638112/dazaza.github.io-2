It climbed in price because a subreddit, r/WallStreetBets, engineered a short squeeze.</p><p> 但这至少不会持续一会儿。它的价格上涨是因为r / WallStreetBets这是次抢注，造成了短暂的挤压。</p><p>  That kicked off a wild ride, revealing many things not just about how digital technologies are transforming our world, but also about how they are not. It was yet another stark demonstration that technology is not  simply a tool—neutral on all possible outcomes, good or bad —but something more dynamic, messy and complicated. It’s a complex system where the workings of both the technology and our society, and crucially, how they interact with each other matter greatly.</p><p>  这开了一个疯狂的旅程，不仅揭示了许多有关数字技术如何改变我们的世界的事情，而且还揭示了许多问题。这又是一个鲜明的证明，技术不仅是一种工具，在所有可能的结果中（无论好坏）都是中立的，而是更加动态，混乱和复杂的东西。这是一个复杂的系统，技术和我们的社会，以及至关重要的是，它们如何相互影响都至关重要。</p><p>  This is how the squeeze worked: A few large hedge funds had “shorted” GameStop. That means that they had  borrowed the stock, with the intention of returning it when the share price moved lower, as they expected it would, leaving them with a profit. Obviously, this works only if the future price of the stock is indeed lower. If the share price rises, the hedge funds would have to buy the stock at the new, higher price, leading to losses. Investors on r/WallStreetBets had noticed that this particular short position was especially vulnerable because  a large portion of its existing shares was tied up in the short betting. They explained to others in the forum that if the price went up and up, the hedge funds would eventually be forced to cover those short positions by purchasing the stock back at a much higher price—from them.</p><p>  紧缩就是这样：一些大型对冲基金“做空”了GameStop。这意味着他们已经借入了股票，目的是在股价按照他们的预期下跌时将其归还，从而使他们获利。显然，这只有在股票的未来价格确实更低时才有效。如果股价上涨，对冲基金将不得不以更高的新价格购买股票，从而导致亏损。 r / WallStreetBets的投资者已经注意到，这个特殊的空头头寸特别容易受到攻击，因为其大部分现有股票都被空头押注所束缚。他们在论坛上向其他人解释说，如果价格上涨，对冲基金最终将被迫以更高的价格回购股票来弥补这些空头头寸。</p><p>  The attempted squeeze and the ensuing rise in GameStop’s stock price was a media sensation.</p><p>  尝试的挤压以及随后GameStop股价的上涨引起了媒体的轰动。</p><p>  On January 25,  The New York Times wrote: “In an epic contest between Wall Street traders who bet against stocks and legions of small-scale investors, the small guys are winning.”</p><p>  1月25日，《纽约时报》写道：“在华尔街交易员之间进行的一场史诗般的竞赛中，他们押注股票和大量小规模投资者，小家伙赢了。”</p><p> On January 27, just two days later, the stock hit $347. A writer for  Bloomberg  said that this was an example of the internet world affecting reality. She compared the small-scale investors on Reddit to people into live-action role playing, and said this market LARPing could “lead to changes in the real world.” She contrasted the “rational” pros that operate according to “fundamentals” with the “tribal dynamics” of the “feelings-fueled investors.”</p><p> 1月27日，仅两天后，该股达到347美元。彭博社的一位作家说，这是互联网世界影响现实的一个例子。她将Reddit上的小规模投资者与真人角色扮演者进行了比较，并说这个市场LARPing可能“导致现实世界的变化”。她将根据“基本原理”运作的“理性”职业人士与“情绪刺激的投资者”的“部落动态”进行了对比。 </p><p>  Self-organized groups have been using the web to act on the physical world for a while. The tech companies that enable this behavior are themselves old. Facebook turned 17 on February 4. Google is already 22, Reddit is 15, and Apple’s iPhone—which ushered in the era of smartphones—is 13. We’ve had many years to think smarter about what digital connectivity means. And yet, we still face this idea that the internet is a game, that the virtual world is something distinct from the  real one. This condescension is even embedded in the phrase  IRL—“in real life,” meaning not online.</p><p>自组织的团体已经使用网络在现实世界上行动了一段时间。支持这种行为的科技公司本身就已经很老了。 Facebook在2月4日满17岁。谷歌已经22岁，Reddit已15岁，苹果公司的iPhone（迎来了智能手机时代）已经13岁了。但是，我们仍然面临这样的想法，即互联网是一种游戏，虚拟世界是与真实世界截然不同的东西。这种自尊心甚至被嵌在“真实生活中” IRL一词中，意味着不在网上。</p><p>  But the internet isn’t a game. It’s real. And it’s not just a neutral mirror that passively reflects society. One hears that notion from tech elites who’d like to deflect blame from their own creations, which have both empowered and enriched them. “ It’s just a tool,” they say. This same mentality is what made Mark Zuckerberg say that it was a “ pretty crazy idea” that Facebook had anything to do with Donald Trump’s election—a statement he had to walk back, in part, because it contradicted everything that  Facebook usually claims: that its software matters; that it influences people; that it changes, rather than merely reflects, the world.</p><p>  但是互联网不是游戏。它是真实的。不仅仅是被动反映社会的中立镜子。有人听到了技术精英的想法，他们想摆脱自己创造的责任，这些创造既赋予了他们权力，又使他们富足了。他们说：“这只是一种工具。”这同样的心态是什么让马克·扎克伯格说，这是一个“非常疯狂的想法”，Facebook的有什么关系唐纳德·特朗普的选举的声明，他只好往回走，部分原因是因为它违背一切，Facebook的一般要求：即它的软件很重要；它影响着人们；它改变了世界，而不仅仅是反映了世界。</p><p>  On January 28, Robinhood and other major trading platforms abruptly announced that they had restricted transactions for GameStop—and a few other stocks that redditors were also trying to squeeze. All of a sudden, people could not open a new position to purchase those stocks. Robinhood users weren’t forced to sell their existing shares, but they  could not buy more than a single GameStop stock and five option contracts (which give the bearer the right to buy or sell an underlying stock in the future).</p><p>  1月28日，罗宾汉（Robinhood）和其他主要交易平台突然宣布，他们已限制GameStop的交易-以及Redditors也试图挤压的其他几只股票。突然之间，人们无法开设新仓来购买这些股票。 Robinhood用户并没有被迫出售其现有股票，但是他们不能购买多于一份GameStop股票和五份期权合约（这使得持有人将来有权购买或出售标的股票）。</p><p>  Robinhood is particularly important to this saga because it was the platform of choice for r/WallStreetBets. It drove the retail (meaning small investors rather than big institutions) trade boom because individuals could buy and sell as much as they wanted without a fee. But as with social media, Robinhood’s users were about to find out that the intermediary platform’s business model mattered greatly.</p><p>  Robinhood对于这个传奇特别重要，因为它是r / WallStreetBets的首选平台。它推动了零售（意味着小投资者而不是大机构）的贸易繁荣，因为个人可以免费购买和出售他们想要的东西。但是，与社交媒体一样，Robinhood的用户将发现中介平台的业务模式非常重要。</p><p>  Unlike traditional brokerages, which charge a fee for buying and selling, Robinhood offers these seemingly free trades because it makes its money in large part by  selling the trades  to big buyers, many of them other hedge funds. It’s those players that will make the real money—and in turn pay Robinhood for the privilege.</p><p>  与传统的经纪公司收取买卖费用不同，Robinhood提供这些看似自由的交易，因为它主要通过将交易出售给大买家（其中很多是其他对冲基金）来赚钱。正是那些玩家会赚到真正的钱，然后向Robinhood支付特权。</p><p> The restrictions came because, under its business model, Robinhood could not put up the kind of capital required for all of these trades in the  clearinghouses where they are eventually settled, the company  wrote in a blog post. So it wasn’t that Robinhood had an interest in kneecapping the short squeeze. Rather, it was never a suitable platform for engineering a squeeze of this scale—based on “free” trades by retail investors precisely because those investors were never its true customers.</p><p> 限制之所以出现，是因为在其业务模式下，Robinhood无法在最终结算的票据交换所中提供所有这些交易所需的资本，该公司在博客中写道。因此，罗宾汉（Robinhood）并没有兴趣屈服于短暂的挤压。相反，它从来不是一个适合进行如此规模挤压的合适平台-基于散户投资者的“免费”交易，恰恰是因为这些投资者从来都不是其真正的客户。</p><p>  These consequences do not necessarily flow from any particular malice from the company or its employees. Instead, it’s always important to pay attention to a company’s incentives, and especially how it makes money. This is especially crucial with digital platforms, where the real mechanisms aren’t as easily visible. If a retailer sells shoes, for example, you expect them to make money … selling shoes. For many digital platforms, though, the users are not the actual customers, and that has profound consequences.</p><p>  这些后果不一定来自公司或其员工的任何特定恶意。相反，始终必须注意公司的激励措施，尤其是如何赚钱。对于数字平台而言，这一点尤其重要，因为数字平台的真实机制不那么容易被看到。例如，如果零售商出售鞋子，您希望他们赚钱……卖鞋子。但是，对于许多数字平台而言，用户不是真正的客户，这将产生深远的影响。 </p><p> These dynamics play out across many digital platforms. Similar to how Robinhood makes money not from individual traders, who are its users, but from its hedge-fund customers, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and the rest make money by selling our attention to advertisers or anyone looking to influence people. This business model also fuels surveillance because paid influence operations work better if they have more data to improve their targeting; data allow them to better find ways to “engage” us. And if there is one thing we know about a social species like humans, it is that in-group versus out-group dynamics (us versus them) are  very engaging. Similarly, novelty and misinformation are often attractive, and the truth boring and unengaging. Thus, even though the engineers at these companies don’t set out to amplify tribalism and polarization, the algorithms they let loose on us inevitably do, as a corollary of their optimization target.</p><p>这些动力可以在许多数字平台上发挥作用。与Robinhood的赚钱方式类似，它不是通过用户的个人交易者来赚钱，而是通过其对冲基金客户来赚钱。这种商业模式还可以促进监视，因为如果有影响力的人有更多的数据来改善其针对性，他们的工作就会更好。数据使他们能够更好地找到“吸引”我们的方法。而且，如果我们对人类这样的社会物种了解到一件事，那就是群体内与群体外的动态关系（我们与他们之间的互动）非常吸引人。同样，新颖性和错误信息通常很有吸引力，而事实却无聊而毫无意义。因此，即使这些公司的工程师并未着手扩大部落主义和两极分化，但作为他们优化目标的必然结果，他们向我们放手的算法不可避免地会这样做。</p><p>  This complex interplay between business models, technology, and existing power structures in our society means that we have to move beyond simple narratives: The underdog is winning! Technology is liberating us! The underdog has lost! It must be technology’s fault! To understand the Robinhood and GameStop episode, it is also essential to understand how Wall Street operates, and how the fortunes of big corporations and their executives have become intertwined with it.</p><p>  商业模式，技术和我们社会中现有权力结构之间的复杂相互作用，意味着我们必须超越简单的叙述：失败者正在获胜！科技正在解放我们！失败者输了！一定是技术上的错！要了解Robinhood和GameStop插曲，还必须了解华尔街的运作方式，以及大公司及其高管的命运如何与之交织在一起。</p><p> On February 2, GameStop closed at $90, less than 20 percent of its all-time high, which it had reached just a few days earlier. Like many internet stories, the narrative may start with the “little guy” winning—David against Goliath—but they rarely end that way. The little guy loses, not because he is irrational and too emotional, but because of his relative power in society.</p><p> 2月2日，GameStop的收盘价为90美元，不到几天前创下的历史新高的20％。像许多互联网故事一样，叙述可能始于“小人物”获胜（David击败Goliath），但这种结局很少。这个小家伙之所以失败，不是因为他不理性，太情绪化，而是因为他在社会中的相对力量。</p><p>  Similarly, Facebook was first celebrated for empowering dissidents during the Arab Spring, but just a few years later it was a key tool in helping Donald Trump win the presidency—and then, later, in clipping his wings, when it joined with other major social-media companies to deplatform him following the insurrection at the Capitol. The reality is that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube are not for or against the little guy: They make money with a business model that requires optimizing for engagement through surveillance. That explains a lot more than the “for or against” narrative. As historian Melvin Kranzberg’s famous aphorism goes: “Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.”</p><p>  同样，Facebook在阿拉伯之春期间因赋予异议人士权力而闻名，但仅在几年后，它便成为帮助唐纳德·特朗普赢得总统职位的关键工具，随后又与其他主要社交网站合而为一国会大厦起义后，媒体公司将他解散。现实情况是，Facebook，Twitter和YouTube并不赞成或反对小家伙：他们通过需要通过监视来优化参与度的业务模型来赚钱。这比“赞成或反对”叙事解释得更多。正如历史学家梅尔文·克兰兹伯格（Melvin Kranzberg）的著名格言所说：“技术既不好也不坏；也不是中立的。”</p><p>  It’s also important to remember that platforms are never  all there is to these stories. For example,  the United Nations has taken Facebook to task for amplifying hate speech that fueled the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Myanmar, but Myanmar’s government had already been fueling ethnic divisions. Similarly, decades of U.S. institutions slowly but surely failing, becoming less responsive and less accountable toward the interests of ordinary people, allowed someone like Trump to win the presidency.</p><p>  同样重要的是要记住，这些故事从来都不是平台。例如，联合国已将Facebook的任务扩大为煽动仇恨言论的仇恨言论，这种言论助长了对缅甸罗兴亚人的种族清洗，但缅甸政府已经在助长种族分裂。同样，数十年来的美国机构缓慢但肯定会失败，变得反应迟钝，对普通百姓的利益负责程度降低，使得像特朗普这样的人赢得了总统职位。</p><p> In 2021, one must be quite oblivious to argue that unyielding adherence to “fundamentals” is what allows certain companies to do spectacularly well on Wall Street, and that people attempting to engineer a short squeeze are merely irrational or dominated by feelings. Recent history has made a mockery of Wall Street’s pretensions to superior rationality. In the lead-up to the 2008 crash, under-regulated, cash-rich Wall Street pros made enormous bets using complex and indefensible formulas and clever tricks, making themselves richer while doing so. Those bets and formulas were not rational, but they were convenient as long as one could pretend they made sense. When it all finally came tumbling down, after a large investment bank went bankrupt, the whole financial sector was bailed out with taxpayer money, because the intertwined nature of the industry and the size of their massive bets meant they could drag the whole global economy down with them.</p><p> 在2021年，必须坚决地坚持不懈地坚持“基本原则”才是使某些公司在华尔街上表现出色的原因，而试图进行短暂挤压的人们仅仅是不理性的或受情感支配的，这一定是一个相当不为人知的事情。最近的历史嘲笑了华尔街对高级理性的自夸。在2008年股市崩盘之前，监管不善，现金充裕的华尔街专业人士使用复杂而无懈可击的公式和巧妙的技巧下了大笔赌注，从而在此过程中变得更加富有。这些赌注和公式并不合理，但只要有人假装说得通，它们便很方便。当这一切最终崩溃时，一家大型投资银行破产后，整个金融部门都被纳税人的钱所救助，因为该行业的相互交织的性质和巨额赌注的规模意味着它们可能会拖累整个全球经济跟他们。</p><p>  What was the consequence for these reckless, greedy, and irresponsible actions that could in no way be defended as rational investments based on “fundamentals”? A few people may have lost their massive bonuses for a short time, but no Wall Street executive went to jail. Just one year after being bailed out, they were back in business, handing  out $20 billion in bonuses, as unemployment was soaring. However, for the millions of families without extensive wealth buffers, the effects of that crash have been terrible—not just a year of small or no bonuses—and will likely linger their whole lives. What one side has is not superior rationality, but superior power.</p><p>  这些鲁ck，贪婪和不负责任的行动的后果是什么，这些行动绝不能以基于“基本原理”的合理投资辩护？少数人可能会在短时间内失去巨额奖金，但没有华尔街高管入狱。在获得纾困的仅仅一年后，由于失业率飙升，他们又重新开始营业，发放了200亿美元的奖金。但是，对于没有大量财富缓冲的数百万家庭而言，这场崩溃的后果是可怕的-不仅仅是一年很少或没有分红，而且很可能会流连忘返。一方所拥有的不是优越的理性，而是优越的力量。 </p><p>  The pattern is persistent, and it’s not even concealed. The higher echelons of the corporate world play together with the government and Wall Street to  enrich themselves. For example, major US airlines have spent nearly all  its extra cash on stock buybacks for  the past decade, thereby inflating its stock price—and thus executive pay, which is often tied to stock price—and the stock market. And when the tough times came with the pandemic? The industry got a  $25 billion bailout from the government, as one does. Boeing, too, spent most of its cash on stock buybacks, and its CEO was fired with a  $62 million exit package not long after the Boeing 737 Max crisis—which resulted in two crashes and 346 dead. A 2013 report found that the average “golden parachute” for the top-paid CEO who was  fired  was $47.7 million. On  it goes.</p><p>模式是持久的，甚至没有被隐藏。企业界的高层与政府和华尔街一起发挥自己的作用。例如，在过去的十年中，美国主要航空公司几乎将其所有多余现金都花在了股票回购上，从而抬高了其股价（进而抬高了通常与股价挂钩的高管薪酬）以及股市。当大流行带来艰难的时刻时？就像一个人一样，该行业从政府那里获得了250亿美元的救助。波音公司也将其大部分现金用于股票回购，而在波音737 Max危机爆发后不久，该公司的首席执行官被解雇了6200万美元的退出方案，该事故导致两次坠机和346人死亡。 2013年的一份报告发现，被解雇的高薪首席执行官的平均“金色降落伞”为4,770万美元。继续吧。</p><p>  The social contract is broken, and that’s why the game feels rigged. Right now, especially in countries like the United States, many of the largest, most profitable companies play the  legal-tax-evasion game to the point that they are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. (Apple alone has cash reserves that hover around  $200 billion. Similarly, both Microsoft and Alphabet/Google have more than $100 billion  in their cash pile.) These stockpiles are humongous and the companies are not productively investing them—by building something, or by paying people—so the money all goes back into the stock market. When there is such concentrated wealth, many assets—from stocks to Picasso paintings—appreciate. Such disproportionate investment in speculative or  nonproductive assets, coupled with the lack of investment in things that make society work better for more people, like education and health care, further break the social contract.</p><p>  社交契约被打破了，这就是为什么游戏让人感到操纵不善的原因。目前，尤其是在美国这样的国家，许多最大，最赚钱的公司都在逃避合法税收的游戏，以至于他们坐拥数千亿美元的现金。 （仅苹果公司的现金储备就徘徊在2000亿美元左右。类似地，微软和Alphabet / Google的现金储备都超过1000亿美元。）这些库存巨大，公司没有通过建设或以其他方式进行有效的投资。付钱的人-所以所有的钱都回到了股票市场。当拥有如此集中的财富时，从股票到毕加索画作的许多资产都会升值。投机性或非生产性资产的这种不成比例的投资，再加上缺乏对使社会对更多人有利的事物的投资，例如教育和医疗保健，进一步破坏了社会契约。</p><p> When things are so unequal, and power so concentrated on one side, moralizing takes about whether r/WallStreetBets is  a mob ring hollow. What makes them “a mob” for trying to profit together, while Davos is a distinguished gathering? Before digital technologies, it was mostly the wealthy and the connected who could coordinate and conspire to manipulate markets. Disruption certainly came with the internet, which made it easy for anyone to find a group to communicate and coordinate with. But the internet isn’t a pony that empowers only the nice groups we like (Arab Spring dissidents, but not white supremacists), nor does it magically and instantaneously alter the power dynamics in society (so the underdog can suddenly be assured of a Hollywood ending).</p><p> 当事物如此不平等，而权力如此集中在一侧时，道德化就取决于r / WallStreetBets是否是暴民圈的空洞。在达沃斯是一个杰出的聚会时，是什么使他们成为试图共同获利的“暴徒”？在采用数字技术之前，大多数人都是富有和相互联系的人，他们可以协调和密谋操纵市场。互联网肯定会带来混乱，这使任何人都可以轻松地找到可以交流和协调的团体。但是，互联网不是只给我们喜欢的好人群体提供支持的小马（阿拉伯之春持不同政见者，而没有白人至上主义者），它也不是在魔法和瞬间改变社会力量的动力（因此，失败者可以突然放心好莱坞结尾）。</p><p>  On February 4, GameStop fell to $53. That day, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen went  on  Good Morning America and said she was meeting with regulators to discuss whether they needed to take “further action” to protect the investors—presumably including the investors at r/WallStreetBets, many of whom lost  a lot of money. Did they take hope from her statements? It’s hard to know, in part because Yellen’s financial forms  show that she made about $7 million in two years from speaking fees, much of it from talks given to banks and hedge funds, including Citadel, the very hedge fund that purchases trade information from Robinhood. It paid her $810,000  for a few speeches. Similarly, Ben Bernanke—former chair of the Federal Reserve—is now on Citadel’s payroll as a senior adviser. This may not preclude Yellen from taking positive steps, but you also can’t blame retail investors for wondering if the game is rigged against them, when there is such a fast revolving door between the government, the highest tiers of corporate America, and Wall Street.</p><p>  2月4日，GameStop跌至53美元。那天，财政部长珍妮特·耶伦（Janet Yellen）参加了《美国早安》杂志，并说她正在与监管机构开会，讨论他们是否需要采取“进一步行动”来保护投资者-大概包括r / WallStreetBets的投资者，其中许多人损失惨重钱。他们从她的陈述中抱有希望吗？很难知道，部分原因是耶伦的财务表格显示，她在两年内从演讲费中赚了700万美元，其中很大一部分是从与银行和对冲基金的谈判中获得的，其中包括Citadel，这是从Robinhood购买交易信息的非常对冲基金。它为她的一些演讲支付了81万美元。同样，美联储前主席本·伯南克（Ben Bernanke）现在担任Citadel的高级顾问。这可能并不妨碍耶伦采取积极的措施，但是当政府，美国公司的最高层和沃尔之间有如此快速的旋转门时，您也不能责怪散户投资者想知道游戏是否对他们不利街道。</p><p>  On February 7, during the Super Bowl, Reddit used the r/WallStreetBets incident  for a feel-good ad. “Powerful things happen when people rally around something they really care about. And there’s a place for that. It’s called Reddit,” the ad flashed. It went on to celebrate the underdog: “One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything when we come together around a common idea.” It was all warm and fuzzy.</p><p>  2月7日，在超级碗比赛中，Reddit使用r / WallStreetBets事件制作了一个不错的广告。 “当人们团结起来真正关心的事情时，强大的事情就会发生。而且有一个地方。这就是Reddit，”广告闪过。它继续庆祝失败者：“上周我们从社区中学到的一件事是，当我们围绕一个共同的想法聚在一起时，失败者几乎可以完成任何事情。”一切都温暖而模糊。</p><p> Reddit may feel as if the ad cheers on the underdogs who congregated on its platform, but some of them  lost real money. In contrast, many big players likely  made a lot of money from the GameStop mess. A single hedge fund reported  making $700  million. The big players are preparing to make money by surveilling such future attempts as well: Quiver Quantitative, a firm that monitors platforms like Reddit,  said that it has seen “a surge of interest in its product from hedge funds and other institutional investors in the past two weeks.” The pseudonymous boards of r/WallStreetBets may well have harbored a lot of professional investors, who saw an opportunity to “pump and dump” the stocks.</p><p> Reddit可能感觉广告好像在聚集在其平台上的失败者欢呼，但其中一些人却损失了真钱。相比之下，许多大玩家可能从GameStop混乱中赚了很多钱。一家对冲基金报告赚了7亿美元。大型企业也准备通过监视此类未来尝试来赚钱：监控Reddit等平台的公司Quiver Quantitative表示，“过去，对冲基金和其他机构投资者对其产品的兴趣激增两个星期。” r / WallStreetBets的假名董事会很可能吸引了很多专业投资者，他们看到了“抛售”股票的机会。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/gamestop-mess-shows-internet-rigged-too/618040/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/02/gamestop-mess-shows-internet-rigged-too/618040/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/索具/">#索具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rigged/">#rigged</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
