Folks who rent with these entities can now earn rewards each time they pay their rent, with the opportunity to earn even more rewards for things like lease renewals or lease signing bonuses.\n The co-branded  Bilt Mastercard credit card allows renters at those properties, or any other renter, to pay their rent with the credit card. As a renter myself, and as one that is still forced to pay by check via snail mail, this is a welcome offering.\n Folks who use the Bilt Mastercard will earn 2x points on rent payments and one point per dollar spent on the card elsewhere.\n These points, whether earned through spending on the card or by paying rent at Bilt-partnered properties, can be used toward travel with airlines and hotels, as well as other perks like group fitness classes. But perhaps the most significant option for spending points is to use them toward a mortgage payment.\n Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. So not only can people use their rewards points toward their down payment on a home, but folks using the Bilt Mastercard can also build their credit score and earn rewards at the same time, bringing down the rates on their mortgage.\n On the revenue side, Bilt takes a cut of the transaction fee alongside Mastercard for purchases made through the Bilt credit card. The startup also generates revenue by charging property managers for the points they distribute to their tenants.\n \u201cThree years ago, if you asked us if we could bring together an alliance of property owners to work together under one unified rewards program, it would have been hard to imagine,\u201d said Jain. \u201cIf you think about getting payment networks to collaborate on a credit card or fees on rent, most people would have said that\u2019s not possible. Getting regulatory approval from the U.S. government was a huge hurdle we had to overcome. Building out every airline and hotel partnership was huge. That\u2019s why it\u2019s taken three years. This has been the hardest project we\u2019ve worked on.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:59:22", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8ba1\u5212,program,bilt", "title": "\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u79df\u91d1\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff1f \u89c1\u9762 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tA rewards program for your rent payments?

Epic says the technology has already been \u201cintegrated and battle-tested in  Fortnite,\u201d which provides some assurance that it can handle millions of players at once.\n  Alongside voice chat, Epic Online Services is also adding support for Easy Anti-Cheat, a service designed to root out and boot cheaters from online games. Easy Anti-Cheat has previously been available  for third-party developers to license for their games, but it\u2019s now free as part of Epic Online Services and should allow many more developers to make use of it. Epic argues anti-cheat software like this is increasingly important as more games offer cross-play between PCs and other platforms, since cheating software is often more readily available on PC.\n Like other anti-cheat software, Easy Anti-Cheat can occasionally  cause issues for non-cheaters and  label innocent software as malicious, so it\u2019s far from a perfect solution. But with cheating still  plaguing many of the world\u2019s biggest games, it\u2019s hard to argue against developers having another tool in their arsenal.\n Epic is including both services as part of its Epic Online Services suite, which isn\u2019t tied to its own game engine or storefront. In an FAQ  on its website the company says it offers the services for free \u201cwith the goal of encouraging wider adoption of all of Epic\u2019s offerings\u201d and to build a bigger cross-platform account base for the company and its partners.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:51:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u5f00\u53d1,games,\u670d\u52a1", "title": "EPIC Games\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u804a\u5929\u548c\u53cd\u4f5c\u5f0a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9 ", "title_en": "Epic Games says it will offer free voice chat and anti-cheating tools for developers as part of its Online Services suite, compatible with all major platforms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544447/epic-games-anti-cheat-voice-chat-online-services-free?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u5f00\u53d1", "games", "\u670d\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8a03a3bff828347164c7300548169a8b.png", "infoid": 1067451, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u90e8\u5206\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u6839\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5229\u76ca\u627e\u5230\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\n  \u706b\u79cd\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u8ff7\u604b\u3002\u5728\u7ed9\u4e32\u884c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u540e\uff0c\u4e0a\u79cb\u5b63\u89c6\u9891\u804a\u5929\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u73b0\u5728\u8ba9\u6210\u5458\u6dfb\u52a0\u591a\u4e2a\u526a\u8f91\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u4ece\u4eca\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u624b\u673a\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u706b\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5f55\u5236\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\uff06\uff0334;\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u706b\u79cd\u671f\u671b\u5176Gen Z\u7528\u6237\u5728Tiktok\u548cYouTube\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4f7f\u7528Aplomb\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5360\u5176\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u768450\uff05\u3002\n \u89c6\u9891\u53ea\u662f\u5728\u706b\u79cd\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u65b0\u589e\u542b\u91cf\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u81ea\u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6539\u53d8\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\uff06\uff0334;\u70ed\u5e26\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4f1a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u53f3\u4fa7\u6216\u5de6\u4fa7\u6ed1\u52a8\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8c08\u8bba\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3002\u5f53\u8ba1\u65f6\u5668\u8017\u5c3d\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\uff06\uff0339;

After giving serial daters the  ability to video chat last fall, the app is now letting members add multiple clips to their profile. Starting today, users will be able to edit and upload up to nine recorded videos from their phone to their Tinder profile. This, the company says, offers members a more &#34;authentic way to express themselves.&#34; In particular, Tinder expects its Gen Z users raised on TikTok and YouTube to take to the feature with aplomb. The demographic makes up 50 percent of its global user base.\n Video is just one of several new additions included in Tinder&#39;s latest update, which it hails as one of the biggest changes to its app since launch. It&#39;s also introducing a new speed dating-style social feature called &#34;Hot Takes&#34; that lets unmatched users talk in short spurts before swiping right or left. When the timer runs out, you&#39;ll be able to choose whether to match with the person or move on to another session. Hot Takes will be available from 6pm to midnight on weekdays and marks the first time Tinder users have been able to chat before they match. It actually sounds similar to  Spark, the dedicated speed dating app Facebook launched in April.\n   Finally, Tinder is also debuting a new section called Explore as a way for singletons to connect based on their shared interests, and as a showcase for its live events like Hot Takes. You&#39;ll be able to find potential matches based on their &#34;Passions&#34; like activism, binge watching or thrill seeking. The Explore section will launch later this summer.

", "note_en": "Personal data will continue to flow unimpeded from the EU to the UK, the bloc&#39;s member states have agreed in a unanimous decision that will relieve many businesses on both sides of the Channel of spending much time and money on complex legal paperwork.\n All 27 member states\u00a0 voted in favor of granting the UK an adequacy decision\u00a0\u2013 a special status that recognizes that the country&#39;s data laws do as good a job as the European GDPR at protecting personal information.\n     Countries that are granted adequacy gain the right to receive and process the personal data of EU citizens, which many organizations rely on to do business.\n  The UK&#39;s departure from the EU has meant that the country has ceased to be protected by the GDPR, and instead relies on domestic laws to manage citizens&#39; personal data. Those laws had to be assessed by EU regulators to ensure that they meet the bloc&#39;s standards on data protection.\n Without an adequacy decision, organizations would have had to design special contracts called Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure that they were lawfully processing the data of European citizens. Economists estimate that the total cost of implementing those new contracts to keep data flowing legally could amount to \u00a31.6 billion ($2.14 billion), with smaller firms hit the hardest.\n Achieving adequacy, therefore, was a key part of Brexit negotiations. Earlier this year, the European Commission\u00a0 published a draft document outlining the details of an adequacy decision for the UK, which determined that UK laws do indeed provide a level of data protection that is equivalent to the GDPR.\n   The decision was approved by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in April and has now been green-lighted by member states, meaning that adequacy is on course to be implemented. Unsurprisingly, organisations and businesses across the EU and the UK have welcomed the announcement.\n &#34;A positive decision on data adequacy is a huge relief for thousands of businesses across the UK \u2013 over half of businesses surveyed by the DMA just before Brexit stated this was important for the future of their business,&#34; says Chris Combemale, the CEO of the Data and Marketing Association (DMA). &#34;The government estimated that without adequacy the UK economy could lose up to \u00a385 billion, so this announcement is a significant boost after a challenging year.&#34;\n The volume of personal data that is exchanged between the UK and the EU is significant and spans virtually all industries \u2013 think legal and financial services, but also e-commerce, human resources, and even healthcare.\n The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM), for example, stressed that the delivery of cross-border health and social care for thousands of European citizens relies on data flowing without restrictions with the UK. Health data transfers are also key to advance scientific research.\n &#34;With this (adequacy) decision, the EU and the UK can continue to benefit from the continued secure flow of personal data to facilitate the development of new treatments and to improve patient safety and care across Europe,&#34;\u00a0 said FEAM in a statement.\n While adequacy has been granted to the UK for the time being, however, the decision only applies to UK data law as it is written now. Also known as the &#34;UK GDPR&#34;, the country&#39;s domestic rules are currently modelled on European law and as such, provide a high level of data protection for citizens. But if that were to change, the EU has made clear that it could re-evaluate the decision and withdraw the agreement.\n The issue might become a point of contention. Over the past few months, the UK has repeatedly sent signals that it aims to\u00a0 seize the Brexit opportunity to diverge from the standards set by the bloc&#39;s GDPR\u00a0in an effort to boost growth and innovation.\n &#34;Adequacy was received on the basis that the UK would not diverge and not change the level of protection,&#34; Estelle Mass\u00e9, senior policy analyst and data protection lead at digital rights organisation Access Now, tells ZDNet. &#34;If the UK government were to follow through with this, then the whole legal system on which the EU has based its adequacy determination will no longer be in place and will need to be re-evaluated.&#34;\n     Just days before the EU member states voted in favor of adequacy,\u00a0 a government taskforce submitted a report to the UK prime minister with recommendations to reform the country&#39;s regulatory landscape\u00a0\u2013 including some changes to the UK GDPR.\n Describing the GDPR as &#34;out of date&#34;, the taskforce called for the government to leverage its &#34;newfound regulatory freedom&#34; to replace GDPR with a new UK-made framework for data protection.\n According to the report, GDPR compliance can cost businesses up to 30 working days-worth of time a year, and as such constitutes a significant barrier to innovation and growth. To create a more business-friendly environment, said the taskforce, the UK should implement data laws that are more proportionate, and place lower compliance burdens on smaller organisations.\n In particular, the report&#39;s authors called for the removal of a GDPR provision that lets citizens refuse to be subjected to a decision based solely on an automated decision-making system \u2013 which means that organisations must always have an alternative, human-based process in place to use as an alternative.\n  Instead, the taskforce suggested that automated decisions should be subjected to a test determining whether they are in the public&#39;s interest, and whether they meet critical fairness and transparency criteria.\n The authors also pointed to the GDPR&#39;s restrictions on using data for any purposes other than those for which it was collected, and argued that this means that organisations cannot experiment with data to understand its potential value in new applications.\n The report&#39;s recommendations are yet another red flag for some in the EU. &#34;If this is removed, it could potentially mean that the UK wants to be able to develop the use of automated decision-making systems in the public and private sectors in a way that people couldn&#39;t say no,&#34; says Mass\u00e9.\n &#34;The UK is completely free to take that path is they find it is more beneficial for them. But there will be consequences: if the UK chooses to diverge a lot from the EU, then it will lose its adequacy, and all the industries that rely on exchanging data between the EU and the UK will be in trouble.&#34;\n The next few months are likely to reveal how far the UK wishes to go in transforming the country&#39;s domestic rules on data protection \u2013 and crucially, how much leeway the EU will be willing to give. On both sides, says Mass\u00e9, the outcome of the strategy is still unclear.\n &#34;It&#39;s really quite incomprehensible to work so much to secure this adequacy and when just about to get it, to also give indication to the EU that it may change,&#34; she says. &#34;It&#39;s a really hard diplomacy game \u2013 almost as if the UK is testing the limits of the EU.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u82f1\u56fd,uk", "title": "\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u963b\u788d\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0eGDPR\u4e00\u6837\u597d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "EU member states approve unimpeded data flows between EU and UK, deciding UK's regulations are as good as GDPR, avoiding complex legal paperwork for businesses", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-major-international-data-flow-problem-just-got-resolved-but-another-row-is-already-brewing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f1\u56fd", "uk"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f661bb20457881646e764591f17c9fbc.png", "infoid": 1067449, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Snir\uff06\uff0339;\u6295\u8d44\u529e\u516c\u684c\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u901a\u8baf\u3002\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u662f\u5e38\u7eff\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u6d89\u53ca\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002\n      \u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u662f\u57282021\u5e74\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d8b\u52bf\u79d1\u76ee\uff0c\u5b83\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u6307\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5347\u6e29\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u301c5\uff05\u7684\u5347\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u3002\n \u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7316\u7357\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5047\u8bbe\u60a8\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4f20\u5165\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u60a8\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u51b2\u5b83\u3002\n \u786e\u5b9a\u60a8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u51b3\u5b9a\u60a8\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5c06\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5bf9\u51b2\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\uff06\uff0339;

The subjects are evergreen and deals with the essence of investing, mental models, and concepts.\n      Inflation has been a trending subject for the past few months of 2021, and it gets all the more heated as we see recent Consumer Price Index measurements that show ~5% rise, along with higher inflation expectations from the Fed.\n Whether inflation will go rampant or not is a very complex subject beyond this article. This article assumes you did your own research and got some conclusions on incoming inflation, and you want to know how best to hedge against it.\n Determining how much inflation you think is coming and managing this risk is a crucial step. It will decide how much of your portfolio will be devoted to inflation hedges and how you&#39;ll pay for &#34;opportunity cost&#34; - for example, whether you should pull out 20% or 100% off of a promising growth company you&#39;re invested in.\n  When looking at asset allocation statistically, the details are often hiding behind big numbers. So, for example, a statement like &#34;gold is a great inflation hedge&#34; is factually accurate but might not be right at certain times.\n What if everyone already fears inflation, and the media pumped gold as a hedge so much so that gold at this point had a huge run-up that makes it an overprices hedge that will be counter-productive?\n Another example might be real estate - it is generally a good vehicle against inflation. But if there&#39;s a particular housing crisis in California that got their real estate prices too high already, buying a house there won&#39;t be a good investment regardless.\n You might be competing with much bigger players than you like  most institutional investors are now buying real estate in masses.\n  While we can&#39;t say that all stocks suffer from inflation, the data shows more volatility and more downturns for stocks with inflations.\n I collected all the data since 1928 about inflation and the S&amp;P 500 (or its equivalent) returns. Here&#39;s a visualization of the results:\n   As inflation rises above 3.5%, we see much more downturns, while times of stable inflation, 1-2%, have much fewer downturns.\n This doesn&#39;t mean that the stock market will go down with inflation, but it means that there are significantly higher chances of that happening and higher chances for individual stocks to suffer.\n  Understanding what is in inflation that harms productive companies is vital for the bigger picture.\n Inflation impact different businesses in different ways, and covering it all is impossible. Instead, I&#39;ll cover some common cases to give you an idea and a framework of thought when analyzing other companies:\n  Let&#39;s say you have a lemonade stand, and your capital expenditure is mostly lemons. In the first year, you buy 1,000$ lemons to produce 1,100$ worth of lemonade that you sell.\n That&#39;s a 10% margin on regular days. Next year, you can choose to reinvest and expand your business, buying 1,100$ worth of lemons to sell 1,210$ of lemonade.\n  You&#39;ve got 1,100$ after the first year. But since inflation this year was 10%, those 1,100$ buys you the same amount of lemons as 1,000$ used to buy the year before. So inflation ate up all your margins.\n This is an oversimplification, but it effectively demonstrates the effect rising prices have on businesses. But, of course, there are caveats - when will you raise the lemonade price, whether you can raise it at all in the face of competition, etc. All affecting the outcome, but the story remains the same.\n  Many growth companies today are losing money as a strategy. Often for every 1$ they spend on marketing, bring back a customer that buys for &gt;1$ through the customer&#39;s lifetime with the company, making it worthwhile to spend as much as possible now to grab as much of the market earlier.\n Inflation will not stop these otherwise great companies, but it will require an adjustment to the growth models.\n Marketing platforms and sales processes are getting affected by inflation almost instantaneously. That means that these companies will have to spend more on marketing in an inflationary environment to get the same results.\n All while their pricing power is limited. Customers have contracts pre-signed for years often, with limited optionality for price uplifts even when the current contract ends (as these are enterprise contracts for the most part).\n Higher expenses to grow, with lower real-value income from all existing recurring customers, will harm the growth of the growth companies. However, they will still grow, albeit slower, and it needs to be accounted for.\n   Why inflation is bad news for SASS, money-losing, but great, growth companies  Super-quick thoughts \ud83e\uddf5 $SNOW  $MNDY  $ASAN  $PLTR\n\u2014 Snir David (long term investing) (@snird)  June 18, 2021\n  The last example is delayed inflation, which is somewhat demonstrated in the example above for growth companies.\n Sometimes, prices that a company pays to produce their products (including wages) rise before the company can raise their product prices, creating disparity.\n Stranded in a long-term agreement with predetermined prices, or a crowd that isn&#39;t accustomed to the new price tag, so it avoids the product.\n Furniture company selling to offices in a catalog price for a year, while lumber prices jump 3x on them in the meantime.\n Hairdresser pays higher rent and other living costs, while the crowd prefers to cut their hair at home, as paying 10$ more for a haircut sounds exaggerated to them.\n   Gold is well known for being a good inflation hedge. It&#39;s under limited supply, has underlying value for real-world usage, and has been historically good storage of value, so people trust it.\n I collected the prices of gold through time compared to inflation to visualize how this kind of asset if working:\n   As you can see, gold prices are rising just before inflation increases - as the market always trades on the future, so the action is always slightly before reality.\n But it also typically fall right after the highs of inflation. Thus, making timing a crucial step if you want to trade gold. The market always overprices, both in the ups and the downs of unproductive assets.\n But over time, gold keeps its value and corrects itself. Thus, making it a good hold against inflation, but a total 0% real return if you hold it for the long-term, and not just temporarily as an inflation hedge.\n The same story is told for any other commodity. However, right now, we see other craziness in prices of things like lumber and tomato that has more to do with turbulence in the global shipping and production system rather than a reaction to inflation alone.\n    To drive the point forward that commodities are similar to gold, here are the lumber prices in the 1980s inflation spike:\n    The behavior is very similar to gold. It rises until ~1980 then it drops. While in the long-term, it keeps its underlying value against inflation.\n  There is something to be said about Bitcoin, but I&#39;ll keep it short, even though I know I&#39;ll get a lot of heat for that.\n Unproductive assets like gold and commodities are not like Bitcoin for a simple reason: they have intrinsic, underlying value. There are industrial uses for gold and obviously for lumber. Bitcoin doesn&#39;t have any use other than its existence.\n We can&#39;t compare Bitcoin to gold, but it doesn&#39;t mean it invalidates Bitcoin as a whole. It just invalidates the usage of Bitcoin as an unproductive asset to hedge against inflation. Whether there are other reasons for Bitcoin to take the world by storm is another discussion.\n  If we take the lessons from stocks (productive companies) and gold, commodities (unproductive assets), we can see why real estate is considered the best investment for inflation.\n Real estate is productive through rent with minimal capital expenditure. So you will produce more money following inflation without harming the production by the need to put more money in.\n Real estate is limited and real, like gold. Any real asset, as we saw, is rising in price alongside inflation.\n Real estate is the best against inflation  overall. In the short term, when inflation initially rises, commodities will go higher much faster. But as we saw, they fall back down after. Real estate increases more moderately but doesn&#39;t have the fallback later, making it overall more stable and delivering higher returns in the long term.\n Here&#39;s a graph from an  excellent research paper from state street that demonstrates the performance of assets in different inflation quantiles (the higher quantile, the higher the inflation).\n    REITs perform very well in every quantile, making them the best hedge against inflation for the long-term, providing good returns.\n P.S - I lied. There is something better than real estate - farms. For the same reasons, just better in every step. But as individual investors, we usually can&#39;t buy farms, unlike  Bill Gates that went on a massive purchase extravaganza, making him the biggest farmland owner in America.\n  There are other options, of course. However, I focused on the most prominent and reasonable ones for individual investors.\n Things like TIPS (bonds that follow inflation) naturally protect against inflation, but they come with a 1% coupon these days. Irrelevant. So as government bonds and others, all affected by the extremely low interest rate, I didn&#39;t touch here either.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0,assets", "title": "\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u6f14\u6297\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u8d44\u4ea7 ", "title_en": "Best performing assets against inflation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.the-investing-desk.com/blog/best-investments-for-inflation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0", "assets"]}]
