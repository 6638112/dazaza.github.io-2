You are not alone. Everyone should feel safe in their neighborhood. Reach out. Listen. Take action.”</p><p>在一张黑卡上，白字写着，“黑人的生命很重要。你并不孤单。每个人在自己的社区都应该感到安全。伸出手。听。采取行动吧。“。</p><p> A flood of companies issued similar pro-BLM social media posts, and many were mocked for the way the message ran counter to their actions regarding race, but few received a response as fierce as Nextdoor’s. Beyond the digital scorn, NBC News soon reported that Nextdoor users were spreading false rumors about anti-fascist protesters being bused into neighborhoods, fueled by President Trump’s rhetoric.  BuzzFeed and  The Verge followed up with stories about Nextdoor’s moderators deleting posts about Black Lives Matter and the platform’s lack of tools to help them navigate difficult conversations. The usually buoyant Best of Nextdoor, a comedic Twitter account that shares outlandish posts from Nextdoor’s more than 265,000 global neighborhoods, launched a petition with demands including that moderators undergo bias training and accept a code of conduct.</p><p>一大批公司在社交媒体上发布了类似的支持BLM的帖子，许多公司因为这条信息与他们在种族问题上的行为背道而驰而受到嘲笑，但很少有公司得到像Nextdoor那样激烈的回应。除了数字上的蔑视，NBC新闻很快报道，Nextdoor的用户在特朗普总统的言论的推动下，散布反法西斯示威者被大巴送到社区的虚假谣言。BuzzFeed和The Verge紧随其后，报道了Nextdoor的版主删除了关于黑人生活也很重要的帖子，以及该平台缺乏帮助他们驾驭艰难对话的工具。通常兴高采烈的Best of Nextdoor是一个喜剧推特账号，分享来自Nextdoor超过26.5万个全球社区的古怪帖子，该账号发起了一项请愿活动，要求主持人接受偏见培训，并接受行为准则。</p><p> Before the pandemic, Nextdoor was known for perhaps two things: absurd posts that broke free from the neighborhoods in which they emanated (such as the recent one about a feral peacock roaming around an Oakland, California, community), and its role in racial profiling and over-policing. Soon after the company announced a round of funding in 2015 that valued it at more than $1 billion, an article in  Fusion reported that Black residents walking in neighborhoods were often photographed and posted on the site as suspicious, and crime reports often only had one description of the suspect: their race.</p><p>在大流行之前，NextDoor可能因为两件事而闻名：从它们所在的社区爆发的荒谬帖子(比如最近关于一只野生孔雀在加利福尼亚州奥克兰的一个社区漫步的帖子)，以及它在种族定性和过度监管中所扮演的角色。该公司在2015年宣布了一轮对其估值超过10亿美元的融资后不久，Fusion的一篇文章报道，在社区行走的黑人居民经常被拍到可疑，并被发布在网站上，犯罪报告往往只有一种对嫌疑人的描述：他们的种族。</p><p> Ever since Sarah Friar arrived from Square, in December 2018, to be Nextdoor’s CEO, she has been trying to outrun the platform’s checkered reputation and transform the company into a powerhouse marketing channel for local businesses. The COVID-19 lockdown displayed the potential in Friar’s vision, which has centered around the concept of “kindness.” As shelter-in-place orders started to take effect in mid-March, Nextdoor released a Help Map for neighbors to post lists of what they needed so others could fulfill them. The company encouraged neighbors to share information about which businesses were open—even if just for curbside pickup and delivery—and facilitated the purchases of gift cards to help local establishments while they were shuttered. Nextdoor experienced an 80% month-over-month surge in daily active users.</p><p>自从2018年12月莎拉·弗里尔(Sarah Friar)从Square来到Nextdoor担任首席执行官以来，她一直试图超越该平台参差不齐的声誉，将公司转变为当地企业的强大营销渠道。新冠肺炎的禁闭展示了弗莱尔愿景中的潜力，这一愿景的核心是“善良”的概念。随着就地避难所的命令在3月中旬开始生效，Nextdoor发布了一份帮助地图，让邻居们发布他们需要的东西的清单，这样其他人就可以满足他们的要求。该公司鼓励邻居分享哪些企业还在营业的信息-即使只是在路边提货和送货-并为购买礼品卡提供便利，以帮助当地机构在关闭时提供帮助。Nextdoor经历了80%的日活跃用户环比激增。</p><p> “I just spent the last year and a half of my life evangelizing why your neighbors are the first line of defense and why you want to have strong ties,” Friar tells me when we chat via Zoom in May, her from the room over the garage of her Marin County home and me in my San Francisco apartment. By the last week of February, before any U.S. cities had locked down, Friar had been preaching readiness during stand-up meetings with employees. “It was clear that this was happening, and that we had to step up to lead.”</p><p>今年5月，当我们通过Zoom聊天时，弗里尔告诉我，“我只是花了一年半的时间来宣传为什么你的邻居是第一道防线，为什么你想要建立牢固的关系。”她在她位于马林县家中车库的房间里，我在我位于旧金山的公寓里。到了2月的最后一周，在美国任何城市被封锁之前，弗里尔在与员工的站立会议上一直在宣扬准备好了。“很明显，这种情况正在发生，我们必须挺身而出，发挥领导作用。”</p><p> Nextdoor has become a digital microcosm of America’s real-world problems. The pandemic has endangered the long-term health of the local businesses and neighborhoods that are Nextdoor’s customers and users, respectively, while Amazon’s market share and dominance in retail only grows and Facebook and Google dominate the information—and advertising—landscape. But perhaps even more crucially, as the pandemic rages on and questions of social inequality persist, it seems unclear whether our future will be one of random acts of generosity, as preached by Friar. Or if panopticism will rule the day, and neighborhoods will become prisons of our own making, powered by a stitched-together surveillance regime of doorbell cameras and accusatory social media posts.</p><p>NextDoor已经成为美国现实世界问题的一个数字缩影。这场流行病已经危及了当地企业和社区的长期健康，这些企业和社区分别是Nextdoor的客户和用户，而亚马逊在零售业的市场份额和主导地位只会增长，Facebook和谷歌则在信息和广告领域占据主导地位。但也许更关键的是，随着大流行的肆虐和社会不平等问题的持续存在，我们的未来是否会像弗里尔所宣扬的那样是随机的慷慨行为，似乎还不清楚。或者，如果全视主义将占据主导地位，社区将成为我们自己制造的监狱，由门铃摄像头和指责社交媒体帖子缝合在一起的监控制度提供动力。</p><p>  Nextdoor was founded in 2010 by seven friends, most of whom had worked together at Shopping.com. They built the prototype in Lorelei Manor, a coveted micro-neighborhood made up of fewer than 100 homes on just four streets in the Silicon Valley town of Menlo Park and ruled by a homeowner’s association, those bastions of niggling rules and supercilious neighbors. As the founders worked with the locals in their mid-century ranch houses, Prakash Janakiraman, Nextdoor’s chief architect and a cofounder, recalls a Lorelei resident asking, “ ’You’re building this, and you’re building it just for us. What if we love what you build, but you don’t love it as an idea?’ and [one of the cofounders] looked back at him and said, ‘You know what, I’m pretty sure that if you love it, we’re going to love it.&#39;”</p><p>Nextdoor是由七位朋友于2010年创立的，他们中的大多数人都曾在Shopping.com工作过。他们在洛雷雷庄园(Lorelei Manor)建造了这个原型，这是一个令人垂涎的微型社区，由硅谷小镇门洛帕克(Menlo Park)仅四条街道上不到100户人家组成，由房主协会统治，这些堡垒充斥着琐碎的规则和傲慢的邻居。创始人与当地人一起在他们世纪中叶的牧场别墅里工作时，邻门建筑的首席建筑师兼联合创始人普拉卡什·雅纳基拉曼回忆说，一位洛雷雷居民问道，“ ‘你在建造这个建筑，而且你是专门为我们建造的。如果我们喜欢你建造的东西，但你不喜欢它作为一个想法怎么办？(其中一位联合创始人)回头看着他说，‘你知道吗，我敢肯定，如果你喜欢它，我们也会喜欢它的。’</p><p> The site was an immediate success. Most of the neighborhood was online within a few weeks and it became the model for Nextdoor’s national rollout, though the ideal community would have about 1,500 to 2,000 households, verified for membership by the company or other neighbors to confirm their standing as a local resident.</p><p>该网站立即获得了成功。该社区的大部分地区在几周内就上线了，它成为了Nextdoor在全国推广的典范，尽管理想的社区应该有大约1500到2000户家庭，经过公司或其他邻居的会员验证，以确认他们是当地居民的身份。</p><p> Unwittingly, the Nextdoor founders had hit upon the promise of what Brown University historian Marc Dunkelman calls the “middle ring” of American relationships. These are not our closest connections (our “inner ring” of family and friends), nor are they the “outer ring” of people we barely know. The middle ring is folks who are “familiar but not intimate, someone with whom, if you bumped into in the street, you’d be able to ask about something more than the weather,” he says.</p><p>在不知不觉中，Nextdoor的创始人偶然发现了布朗大学(Brown University)历史学家马克·邓克尔曼(Marc Dunkelman)所称的美国关系“中间环”的承诺。这些不是我们最亲密的联系(我们的家人和朋友的“内环”)，也不是我们几乎不认识的人的“外环”。他说，中间环是那些“熟悉但不亲密的人，如果你在街上偶遇，你可以问到比天气更多的事情”。</p><p> “Nextdoor is sort of like a gateway drug for community,” says Dunkelman, author of 2014’s  The Vanishing Neighbor: The Transformation of American Community, who has consulted with Nextdoor. Someone giving away their kid’s scooter on the platform to someone who lives close by them could show up to find that they’re both wearing a Red Sox cap. “It enables people to find one another, and then it’s up to them to exploit that opportunity.”</p><p>邓克尔曼是2014年出版的“消失的邻居：美国社区的转型”一书的作者，他曾咨询过Nextdoor，他说：“Nextdoor有点像是社区的入口毒品。”有人在站台上把孩子的滑板车赠送给住在他们附近的人，可能会发现他们都戴着红袜队的帽子。“它使人们能够找到彼此，然后由他们来利用这个机会。”</p><p> When Friar joined the company, she participated in an exercise where employees are asked what neighborhoods mean to them. She wrote: “A safe place to have the most divisive conversations.” This belief that proximity and difficult conversations are the solution to disunity comes from her upbringing. Friar grew up Protestant in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, the often violent, multi-decade ethnic-nationalist clash between Protestants and Catholics. Her hometown of Sion Mills, though, was notable for its integrated community, even during the height of the conflict. As a girl, she watched her parents—who were close with their Catholic neighbors—deal with more sectarian members of their extended family. “I always appreciated that my parents would really try to talk them through it,” she tells me. “Not like, ‘Here’s why this religion isn’t bad,’ but they would just constantly give examples like, ‘The next-door neighbors brought us over a cake last week.’ There was kind of a humanity, instead of being labeled.”</p><p>当Friar加入公司时，她参加了一次演习，询问员工社区对他们意味着什么。她写道：“一个安全的地方，可以进行最具争议性的对话。”这种认为亲密和艰难的对话是不团结的解决方案的信念来自于她的成长过程。弗里尔在新教徒和天主教徒之间经常发生暴力、长达数十年的种族民族主义冲突的动乱期间在北爱尔兰长大。然而，她的家乡锡安·米尔斯(Sion Mills)即使在冲突最严重的时候，也以其融合的社区而闻名。作为一个女孩，她看着她的父母-他们与天主教邻居关系密切-与他们大家庭中更多的宗派成员打交道。她告诉我：“我一直很感激我的父母真的会试着说服他们度过难关。”“不是说‘这就是这个宗教不坏的原因’，而是经常举‘隔壁邻居上周给我们带蛋糕来’这样的例子。”这是一种人性，而不是被贴上标签。“。</p><p> Friar wants people to stop cackling at their neighbors’ antics, get off the app, and make connections—social or, preferably, business—in the real world. “We really don’t want people to spend a lot of time online,” she says. “Metrics like ‘time in app’ would be very bad for Nextdoor. If you think about potentially being a public company, that’s a known metric that investors often ask about. But I think it will lead us wrong. . . . The job to be done is not ‘Take me into an app and suck me in and have me read a whole bunch of stuff that’s not related’—and actually take away the time that I could be spending on my family or on community.”</p><p>Friar希望人们不再嘲笑邻居的滑稽行为，离开这款应用，在现实世界中建立联系-社交或最好是商业联系。“我们真的不希望人们花太多时间上网，”她说。“像‘在APP中的时间’这样的指标对Nextdoor来说将是非常糟糕的。如果你想成为一家潜在的上市公司，这是投资者经常询问的一个已知指标。但我认为这会让我们误入歧途。。。。要做的工作不是‘让我进入一款应用程序，让我阅读一大堆无关的东西’--实际上会占用我本可以花在家庭或社区上的时间。“。</p><p>  The alternative to the attention-driven “engagement” of a rival like Facebook, which has more than 400 million participants in groups they find “meaningful” (these groups include neighborhoods but also go well beyond them), is utility. “Communication on the [Nextdoor] network, if you look at it on a percentage basis, is highly utilitarian,” says Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist who’s best known for early investments in Uber, Snap, and Stitch Fix and who also was the first to back Nextdoor. “You can see it in the search results. People are looking to solve problems.” (The company hit an all-time high of 125,000 daily searches in May.)</p><p>与Facebook这样的竞争对手以注意力驱动的“参与”相比，另一种选择是效用。Facebook在他们认为“有意义”的群组中有超过4亿的参与者(这些群组包括社区，但也远远超出了社区)。风险投资家比尔·格利(Bill Gurley)说：“(Nextdoor)网络上的交流，如果你按百分比来看，是非常实用的。”他最出名的是对优步(Uber)、Snap和Stitch Fix的早期投资，他也是第一个投资Nextdoor的人。“你可以在搜索结果中看到。人们都在寻找解决问题的办法。“。(该公司5月份的日搜索量达到12.5万次，创历史新高。)。</p><p>  This is why Gurley and his fellow board members hired Friar, in 2018. In effect, they asked her to make Nextdoor the sort of small-business juggernaut Friar created in her last job. In 2012, Friar had joined Square as its CFO, when the financial startup had just a few hundred employees and cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey’s sometimes fantastical ideas for facilitating digital payments. Friar not only steered the company to its 2015 IPO, she also helped launch its highly successful loan product, Square Capital, giving its customer base access to short-term loans that it could repay out of gross receipts processed by Square’s merchant services. Friar, who did stints at Goldman Sachs and Salesforce before Square, became an expert in local business sales and built a reputation as a strong and stable leader. With Dorsey’s time being split with Twitter, she became the rare CFO who was a public face of a company. She was so associated with Square’s success that when Nextdoor announced her appointment, Square’s stock price tumbled 6%.</p><p>这就是格利和他的董事会成员在2018年聘请弗里尔的原因。实际上，他们要求她将NextDoor打造成弗里尔在上一份工作中创建的那种小企业巨头。2012年，弗里尔加入Square担任首席财务官，当时这家金融初创公司只有几百名员工，联合创始人兼首席执行官杰克·多尔西有时会提出促进数字支付的奇思妙想。Friar不仅带领公司完成了2015年的首次公开募股(IPO)，还帮助推出了非常成功的贷款产品Square Capital，使其客户群能够获得短期贷款，这些贷款可以从Square的商业服务处理的总收入中偿还。Friar在Square之前曾在高盛(Goldman Sachs)和Salesforce工作过，他成为了当地企业销售方面的专家，并建立了强大而稳定的领导者的声誉。随着多尔西与Twitter的时间被瓜分，她成为了少有的作为公司公众形象的首席财务官。她与Square的成功息息相关，以至于当Nextdoor宣布她的任命时，Square的股价暴跌了6%。</p><p> Friar’s first step toward her goal has been to try to change Nextdoor’s public perception to make it more advertiser friendly. She replaced the company’s mission from “to bring back a sense of community to the neighborhood, one of the most important communities in each of our lives” to what she hoped to see on the platform—Nextdoor helping to “cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.” To assist her, she created a seven-person “Neighborhood Vitality Advisory Board,” consisting of leading academics in the field of psychology as well as the head of the NAACP and a domestic policy expert from the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative think tank.</p><p>弗里尔朝着她的目标迈出的第一步是试图改变Nextdoor的公众看法，使其对广告商更友好。她取代了公司的使命，从“给我们每个人生活中最重要的社区之一的邻里带回一种社区感”，变成了她希望在平台上看到的-NextDoor帮助“培养一个更友善的世界，每个人都有一个</p><p> Soon after, Friar turned precept into practice. In September 2019, Nextdoor introduced Kindness Reminder, which checks to see if a user’s post has words in it that in the past tended to be flagged as abusive, and then asks them to rephrase before it’s uploaded. The goal, says Tatyana Mamut, Nextdoor’s chief product officer, is to make people “renorm their behaviors, understand that these are real people that they’re talking to, right? These aren’t just usernames on the screen.”</p><p>不久之后，修士把戒律变成了实践。2019年9月，Nextdoor推出了Kindness Remder，它可以检查用户的帖子中是否有过去往往被标记为辱骂的词语，然后要求他们在上传之前重新措辞。Nextdoor的首席产品官塔季扬娜·马穆特(Tatana Mamut)说，我们的目标是让人们“重新规范自己的行为，理解这些是他们正在交谈的真人，对吗？”这些不仅仅是屏幕上的用户名。“。</p><p> Nextdoor built Kindness Reminder based on the work of another academic, Stanford psychologist Jennifer Eberhardt, who studies bias in policy and is the author of  Biased: Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice That Shapes What We See, Think, and Do. Eberhardt had worked with Nextdoor since 2015, helping the company craft a narrow solution in the wake of its racial-profiling scandal (reports of crimes would need to include more than just race), and is a member of its advisory board. The Kindness Reminder quickly proved to be a success: Nextdoor claims a 30% reduction in reported content. It reinforces Nextdoor’s self-conception as a place for feel-good stories about neighbors finding lost pets and giving away outgrown bicycles (tales every Nextdoor executive is programmed to share).</p><p>Nextdoor根据另一位学者、斯坦福大学心理学家詹妮弗·埃伯哈特(Jennifer Eberhardt)的研究成果制作了“善意提醒”。埃伯哈特研究政策中的偏见，著有“偏见：揭开塑造我们所见、所想、所为的隐藏偏见”一书。埃伯哈特自2015年以来一直与Nextdoor合作，帮助该公司在种族定性丑闻之后制定了一个狭隘的解决方案(犯罪报告需要包括的不仅仅是种族)，他是其顾问委员会的成员。善意提醒很快被证明是成功的：Nextdoor声称报告的内容减少了30%。它强化了Nextdoor的自我概念，认为它是一个可以让人感觉良好的故事的地方，比如邻居们找到走失的宠物，以及赠送不够用的自行车(每个Nextdoor的高管都被设计成分享这些故事)。</p><p>  The pandemic made the turn toward cultivating kindness rather prescient. The Help Map, which debuted on March 18, just as U.S. cities started to lock down, allows Nextdoor users to post the kind of things they’d be willing to do to help a neighbor—buy groceries, pick up prescriptions, just make a phone call to say hello—and lets people in need select what help they want. More than 420,000 users offered help on the tool.</p><p>这场大流行使培养善良变得相当有先见之明。3月18日，就在美国各城市开始封锁之际，Help Map首次亮相，允许Nextdoor用户发布他们愿意帮助邻居的事情-购买食品杂货，拿起处方，只需打个电话打个招呼-并让有需要的人选择他们想要的帮助。超过42万名用户提供了关于该工具的帮助。</p><p> But the Help Map had almost come out very differently—in a way that presaged what was to come during the anti-racism protests. A separate prototype let people who needed things delivered post about what they required. In the end, it didn’t get built, because, as Mamut, the product chief, says, “that seems well-meaning but it could have, you know, not great consequences.” A random person coming up the stairs uninvited could just as quickly arouse suspicion and scrutiny on the app as neighborly appreciation.</p><p>但这份帮助地图几乎完全不同-在某种程度上预示了反种族主义抗议期间将会发生的事情。一个单独的原型可以让需要送货的人发布他们需要的东西。最后，它没有建成，因为，正如产品主管马穆特所说，“这似乎是善意的，但它可能会产生，你知道，不会有太大的后果。”一个不请自来的随机上楼的人可能会很快在这款应用上引起怀疑和审视，就像邻里赞赏一样。</p><p>  What Nextdoor executives seem loath to acknowledge is that Nextdoor’s central appeal is not its practicality but rather that our neighbors are weird, cantankerous, and prone to bicker over minutiae. In my neighborhood, a man posted a photo of a dead hawk, along with the caption “Hawk killed by drone in Dolores Park.” He provided no evidence of the raptor’s cause of death and never commented on the image again. The post, first uploaded in December 2019, was still garnering comments four months later, with neighbors arguing over whether flying drones over a park is legal, demanding a necropsy of the bird, debating whether drones are good or not, discussing San Francisco’s new district attorney, and even someone asking, “What, praytell, is a ‘drone’?”</p><p>Nextdoor的高管们似乎不愿承认的是，Nextdoor的核心吸引力不是它的实用性，而是我们的邻居古怪、脾气暴躁，容易在细节问题上争吵不休。在我家附近，一名男子上传了一张老鹰身体的照片，并配上说明：“多洛雷斯公园的老鹰被无人机杀死。”他没有提供猛禽死因的证据，也再也没有对这张照片发表评论。该帖子于2019年12月首次上传，四个月后仍在引发评论，邻居们就无人机飞越公园是否合法争论不休，要求对这只鸟进行尸检，争论无人机好不好，讨论旧金山新任地区检察官，甚至有人问，“祈祷，什么是‘无人机’？”</p><p> The company seems alienated from the fun of reading these posts. Cofounder and original CEO Nirav Tolia said that his comms people “hate Best of Nextdoor.” Friar is slightly more sanguine, but she told Bloomberg TV in April 2020, “We’ve been posting a lot of what we call the ‘actual best of Nextdoor’ . . . the teddy bear hunts, the 6-year-old getting his birthday party. . . .”</p><p>该公司似乎与阅读这些帖子的乐趣疏远了。联合创始人兼首席执行官尼拉夫·托利亚(Nirav Tolia)说，他的通讯员“讨厌隔壁最好的东西”。弗里尔稍微乐观一些，但她在2020年4月告诉彭博电视台，“我们发布了很多我们所说的‘隔壁最好的实际情况’。。。泰迪熊在打猎，6岁的孩子参加生日聚会。。。.“。</p><p> In the same way that the relentless focus on kindness may blind execs to what is delightful about Nextdoor, it may have prevented them from seeing what is dark and dangerous, too.</p><p>以同样的方式，对善意的无情关注可能会让高管们看不到NextDoor令人愉快的东西，这也可能阻止他们看到什么是黑暗和危险的。</p><p> Nextdoor has always existed as part of a constellation of new apps and technology that have created a distributed surveillance state. Along with the rise of crime-reporting app Citizen and the growing ubiquity of Ring doorbell cameras constantly recording video of the street, they have served to create a world where any public behavior can be labeled criminal and put online, the quintessential example being a grainy video of a person merely walking down the street labeled as “suspicious person casing cars.”</p><p>NextDoor一直是一系列新应用程序和技术的一部分，这些应用程序和技术创造了一个分布式监控状态。随着犯罪举报应用“公民”(Citizen)的兴起，以及不断记录街道视频的“响铃”摄像头日益普及，它们创造了一个世界，在这个世界里，任何公共行为都可以被贴上犯罪的标签，并上传到网上，典型的例子是一个人只是走在街上，被贴上了“可疑人员在监视汽车”的标签。</p><p>  This isn’t just a case of users bending the platform to their own needs: Nextdoor has trumpeted its ability to serve as an ad-hoc neighborhood watch for years. In 2013, after a new round of funding and a product refresh, the company made this explicit: “Nextdoor funneled more resources into security tools such as urgent alerts pushed to mobile devices and integrations with police and fire departments,” according to a contemporaneous  VentureBeat article. “These features help form virtual neighborhood watches, where residents can collectively keep watch, communicate, and mobilize when necessary.”</p><p>这不仅仅是用户为了满足自己的需求而扭曲平台的情况：Nextdoor多年来一直在鼓吹其作为临时邻里守望的能力。2013年，在新一轮融资和产品更新之后，该公司明确表示：“NextDoor向安全工具投入了更多资源，比如推送到移动设备上的紧急警报，以及与警察和消防部门的整合。”VentureBeat同时发表的一篇文章称，“NextDoor将更多资源投入到安全工具中，比如推送到移动设备上的紧急警报，以及与警察和消防部门的整合。”这些功能有助于形成虚拟邻里守望，居民可以在必要时集体守望、交流和动员。</p><p> The platform created a “Forward to Police” button that allowed users to send posts directly to their local police department.  CityLab, Bloomberg’s urbanism news site, reported in May 2020 that the company often lavished all-expenses paid trips to its San Francisco headquarters on law enforcement agencies to entice them onto the platform.</p><p>该平台创建了一个“转发给警察”按钮，允许用户直接向当地警察局发送帖子。彭博社(Bloomberg)的城市化新闻网站CityLab在2020年5月报道称，该公司经常向执法机构慷慨提供前往旧金山总部的全额有偿旅行，以吸引他们进入该平台。</p><p> Before the Floyd killing, Nextdoor touted its work with local governments as an essential third element to creating a successful community, along with citizens and merchants. For public agencies—often technologically behind but desperate to communicate with their constituents—being able to target messages to specific areas of the city can make a huge difference. Fire departments can post about gas leaks. Transit agencies can post schedule changes. The government of Washington, D.C., for instance, found huge success during its COVID-19 response in being able to microtarget messages about newly opened testing centers to specific hot spots.</p><p>在弗洛伊德被杀之前，Nextdoor吹嘘其与地方政府的合作是创建一个成功社区的重要第三要素，以及公民和商人。对于通常在技术上落后但急于与选民沟通的公共机构来说，能够将信息定向到城市的特定地区可以产生巨大的不同。消防部门可以发布煤气泄漏的消息。运输机构可以发布时间表更改。例如，华盛顿特区政府在新冠肺炎的回应中取得了巨大的成功，能够将关于新开设的考试中心的信息微定位到特定的热点地区。</p><p> But the agency that’s had the most success—and certainly the most visibility on the platform—has always been the police department. “[Government] is a whole segment of a community that gets why they need to be talking to neighbors,” Friar told me in May, before the groundswell of outrage against police violence. “Now, sometimes you have to kind of introduce them to Nextdoor, like why Nextdoor over a different platform, but the fact is that they need to be where their customers are. The police have customers, it turns out.”</p><p>但最成功的机构-当然也是平台上知名度最高的机构-一直是警察部门。“(政府)是一个社区的一个完整部分，它明白为什么他们需要与邻居交谈，”弗莱尔在5月份告诉我，当时人们对警察暴力的愤怒还没有高涨。“现在，有时你不得不把他们介绍给Nextdoor，就像为什么Nextdoor要通过不同的平台，但事实是，他们需要去他们的客户所在的地方。事实证明，警察是有客户的。“。</p><p> When she and I speak again in June amid the George Floyd–inspired protests, Friar admits that racial profiling is “always a little bit of an undercurrent on the platform,” but says she was still taken aback by the angry responses to their BLM post. Before the tweet, Friar had consulted with the internal “Black at Nextdoor” group, and then, at the company’s usual all-hands two days before the tweet, she says she made it clear that Nextdoor had to do more for its Black employees.</p><p>今年6月，在乔治·弗洛伊德(George Floyd)引发的抗议活动中，当她和我再次交谈时，弗里尔承认，种族定性“总是平台上的一股暗流”，但她说，对他们BLM帖子的愤怒回应仍然让她大吃一惊。在这条推文发布之前，弗莱尔咨询了内部的“隔壁黑人”组织，然后，在推文发布前两天，在公司通常的全体员工面前，她说她明确表示，Nextdoor必须为其黑人员工做更多事情。</p><p> Then they turned to their users to see what was happening on the platform. Seeing the discussions there, Friar says, “we felt collectively as an organization that we wanted to put something out there in the world that just said Black Lives Matter. Unequivocal: Black Lives Matter.” But after the post, on the forum the company runs for neighborhood moderators, many expressed anger and frustration at the Black Lives Matter movement, asking why the company wouldn’t post an “All Lives Matter” statement as well, according to  BuzzFeed.</p><p>然后他们转向他们的用户，看看平台上发生了什么。看到那里的讨论，弗莱尔说：“作为一个组织，我们共同感觉到，我们想要在世界上展示一些只是说黑人的生命很重要的东西。毫无疑问：黑人的生命很重要。“。但据BuzzFeed报道，在这篇帖子发布后，在该公司为社区版主运营的论坛上，许多人表达了对黑人生命也是如此的运动的愤怒和失望，并质问该公司为什么不也发布一份“所有人的生命也是如此”的声明。</p><p>  Although Nextdoor faced a media firestorm, unlike other companies facing similar scrutiny there was no mass exodus of advertisers. So the company’s response, nearly a week later, was as vague as its initial message. It followed up a few days after that with more specifics, stating that it would get rid of its “Forward to Police” function. “It was kind of just one of those features that was there and honestly I hadn’t really looked at it,” says Friar. “Shame on me, but it’d been there since—I think, 2016, we rolled it out—and I never really thought about what it was doing.” She is also pushing to recruit new neighborhood leads who match the demographic makeup of their communities, rather than just letting the first person who starts a neighborhood be the moderator. Nextdoor promises to make sure that leads can see the community guidelines as they’re deciding whether to delete posts, and it will give its 445,000 neighborhood leads anti-bias training. The company also renamed the site’s Crime and Safety vertical to simply “Safety.”</p><p>尽管Nextdoor面临媒体风暴，但与其他面临类似审查的公司不同，没有广告商大规模撤离。因此，近一周后，该公司的回应和最初的信息一样含糊不清。几天后，它又跟进了更多细节，表示将取消“转发给警察”功能。弗里尔说：“这只是一种存在的功能，老实说，我并没有真正看过它。”“让我感到羞愧的是，它从2016年开始就在那里了--我想是在2016年，我们推出了它--我从来没有真正想过它在做什么。”她还在推动招募与他们社区的人口构成相匹配的新的社区领导，而不是仅仅让第一个开始社区的人担任主持人。Nextdoor承诺在决定是否删除帖子时，确保领导可以看到社区指导方针，并将为其44.5万名社区领导提供反偏见培训。该公司还将该网站的犯罪与安全垂直领域更名为“安全”。</p><p> But Friar still believes that the platform should be a place for people to discuss issues of race, just as hard discussions about the Irish conflict helped her family better understand the other side during the Troubles. So it’s hard to pin her down on what exactly the new guidelines will mean beyond “Do not delete posts about Black Lives Matter.” “If someone is actively putting racist content, that comes straight off,” she says. “And if they are being racist, and it’s a nuanced thing, then members get reported and get removed as well.” What’s the difference between racist content and being racist? “I think it’s ultimately incumbent on all of us . . . at some point you have to find your line. . . . And will it change? Absolutely. It’s a living thing, because humans are living, evolving creatures, and the things we do to each other change and evolve over time.”</p><p>但弗里尔仍然认为，这个平台应该是人们讨论种族问题的地方，就像对爱尔兰冲突的激烈讨论帮助她的家人在动乱期间更好地了解了对方一样。因此，除了“不要删除关于黑人生活也很重要的帖子”之外，很难确定新的指导方针到底意味着什么。她说：“如果有人积极地发布种族主义内容，那就会立竿见影。”“如果他们是种族主义者，这是一件微妙的事情，那么会员就会被举报，也会被除名。”种族主义内容和种族主义有什么不同？“我认为这最终是我们所有人义不容辞的责任。。。在某种程度上，你必须找到你的路线。。。。它会改变吗？绝对一点儿没错。它是一种活的东西，因为人类是活的，进化的生物，</p><p>  Friar is visibly more passionate and upbeat talking about the small businesses on the platform, and it’s clear that creating a way to help local business recover is where her sense of mission lies for the company. “I feel like I’m on a crusade, for God’s sake!” she says. “Imagine, if you walk out after all the shelter in place, and it’s devastation of your High Street or your Main Street. Then that has a ripple effect, because that means the people around you don’t have jobs. It really becomes a self-reinforcing downward spiral.”</p><p>Friar在谈论平台上的小企业时显然更加热情和乐观，很明显，创造一种帮助当地企业复苏的方式是她对公司的使命感所在。“看在上帝的份上，我感觉自己像是在进行一场十字军东征！”她说。“想象一下，如果你在所有的避难所就位后走出去，你的商业街或你的主干道都会被摧毁。这会产生连锁反应，因为这意味着你周围的人没有工作。这真的变成了一种自我强化的下行螺旋。“。</p><p> The company is not yet profitable, and with the country in a deep recession, Nextdoor will need to fight for every digital advertising dolla</p><p>该公司还没有盈利，而且随着这个国家陷入深度衰退，Nextdoor将需要为每一个数字广告美元而战。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90560430/inside-nextdoors-wild-2020-from-essential-service-to-a-reckoning-on-racism">https://www.fastcompany.com/90560430/inside-nextdoors-wild-2020-from-essential-service-to-a-reckoning-on-racism</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/fast/">#fast</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nextdoor/">#nextdoor</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
