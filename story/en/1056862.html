She remembers everyone in her middle school being excited by the technology when it became available, and they had fun playing with it. “It was kind of a joke,” she says. “People weren’t trying to look good when they used the filters.”</p><p>veronica开始使用过滤器在她14岁时在社交媒体上编辑自己的照片。她记得在她中学的每个人都被这项技术兴奋，当它变得可用时，他们玩得开心。 “这是一个笑话，”她说。 “当他们使用过滤器时，人们不会试图看起来很好。”</p><p>  But her younger sister, Sophia, who was a fifth grader at the time, disagrees. “I definitely was—me and my friends definitely were,” she says. “Twelve-year-old girls having access to something that makes you not look like you’re 12? Like, that’s the coolest thing ever. You feel so pretty.”</p><p>  但她妹妹，索菲亚，当时是五年级的五年级，不同意。 “我绝对是我和我的朋友肯定是，”她说。 “十二岁的女孩有权进入让你看起来不像12的东西？喜欢，这是有史以来最酷的事情。你感觉很漂亮。“</p><p>  When augmented-reality face filters first appeared on social media, they were a gimmick. They allowed users to play a kind of virtual dress-up: change your face to look like an animal, or suddenly grow a mustache, for example.</p><p>  当增强现实面部过滤器首次出现在社交媒体上时，他们是一个噱头。他们允许用户玩一种虚拟装扮：例如，改变你的脸，看起来像一个动物，或者突然种植髭。</p><p>  Today, though, more and more young people—and especially teenage girls—are using filters that “beautify” their appearance and promise to deliver model-esque looks by sharpening, shrinking, enhancing, and recoloring their faces and bodies. Veronica and Sophia are both avid users of Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok, where these filters are popular with millions of people.</p><p>  尽管如此，越来越多的年轻人 - 特别是少女 - 是使用过滤器，即“美化”他们的外表，并承诺通过锐化，缩小，增强和脸部和身体来提供型号的方式。 Veronica和Sophia都是Snapchat，Instagram和Tiktok的Avid用户，这些过滤器都很受多人民流行。</p><p>    Through swipes and clicks, the array of face filters enable them to adjust their own image, and even sift through different identities, with new ease and flexibility.</p><p>    通过滑动和点击，面部过滤器阵列使其能够通过新的轻松和灵活性来调整自己的图像，甚至筛选不同的身份。</p><p>  Veronica, now 19, scrolls back to check pictures from the time on her iPhone. “Wait,” she says, stopping on one. “Oh yeah ... I was definitely trying to look good.” She shows me a picture of a glammed-up version of herself. She looks seductive. Her eyes are wide, lips slightly parted, and her skin looks tanned and airbrushed. “That’s me when I’m  14,” Veronica says. She seems distressed by the picture. Still, she says, she’s using filters almost every day.</p><p>  veronica，现在19张滚动回来检查她的iPhone上的时间。 “等等，”她说，停下来。 “哦，是的......我绝对试图看起来很好。”她向我展示了一张迷人版本的自己。她看起来很诱人。她的眼睛很宽，嘴唇略微分开，她的皮肤看起来晒黑和喷出喷水。 “那是我14岁的时候，”veronica说。她看起来很痛苦。她说，她几乎每天都在使用过滤器。</p><p>  “When I’m going to use a face filter, it’s because there are certain things that I want to look different,” she explains. “So if I’m not wearing makeup or if I think I don’t necessarily look my best, the beauty filter sort of changes certain things about your appearance and can fix certain parts of you.”</p><p>  “当我打算使用脸部过滤器时，这是因为有一些我想看看不同的东西，”她解释道。 “所以，如果我没有戴着化妆，或者我认为我不一定看起来不是我最好的，美容过滤有点改变你的外表的某些事情，可以解决你的某些部分。” </p><p>  The face filters that have become commonplace across social media are perhaps the most widespread use of augmented reality. Researchers don’t yet understand the impact that sustained use of augmented reality may have, but they do know there are real risks—and with face filters, young girls are the ones taking that risk. They are subjects in an experiment that will show how the technology changes the way we form our identities, represent ourselves, and relate to others. And it’s all happening without much oversight.</p><p>跨社交媒体变得普遍存在的面部过滤器可能是增强现实的最广泛使用。研究人员尚未理解持续使用增强现实的影响，但他们确实知道存在真正的风险 - 而且面部过滤器，年轻女孩是冒险的风险。它们是一个实验中的主题，这将展示技术如何改变我们的身份，代表自己，并与他人联系。而且没有太大的监督一切都在发生。</p><p>    Beauty filters are essentially automated photo editing tools that use artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect facial features and change them.</p><p>    美容过滤器基本上是自动的照片编辑工具，使用人工智能和计算机视觉来检测面部特征并改变它们。</p><p>  They use computer vision to interpret the things the camera sees, and tweak them according to rules set by the filters’ creator. A computer detects a face and then overlays an invisible facial template consisting of dozens of dots, creating a sort of topographic mesh. Once that has been built, a universe of fantastical graphics can be attached to the mesh. The result can be anything from changing eye colors to planting devil horns on a person’s head.</p><p>  他们使用计算机愿景来解释相机看到的东西，并根据过滤器创建者设置的规则调整它们。计算机检测到脸部，然后覆盖由数十个点组成的隐形面部模板，从而创建一种地形网格。一旦构建了，可以将幻想图形宇宙连接到网状物。结果可以是从改变眼睛颜色对一个人的头部种植恶魔角的任何东西。</p><p>  These real-time video filters are a recent advance, but beauty filters more broadly are an extension of the decades-old selfie phenomenon. The movement is rooted in Japanese “kawaii” culture, which obsesses over (typically girly) cuteness, and it developed when purikura—photo booths that allowed customers to decorate self-portraits—became staples in Japanese video arcades in the mid-1990s. In May of 1999, Japanese electronics manufacturer Kyocera released the first mobile phone with a front-facing camera, and selfies started to break out to the mainstream.</p><p>  这些实时视频过滤器是最近的进步，但美容过滤器更广泛地是十年的历史悠久的自拍照现象。该运动植根于日本的“kawaii”文化，它痴迷于（通常是少女）的可爱，并且当Purikura-Photo展台允许客户装饰自画像 - 成为20世纪90年代中期的日本视频拱门的主食。 1999年5月，日本电子制造商Kyocera释放了第一部手机，前面的相机，自拍开始突破主流。</p><p>  The rise of MySpace and Facebook internationalized selfies in the early 2000s, and the launch of Snapchat in 2011 marked the beginning of the iteration that we see today. The app offered quick messaging through pictures, and the selfie was an ideal medium for visually communicating one’s reactions, feelings, and moods. In 2013, Oxford Dictionaries selected “selfie” as the word of the year, and by 2015 Snapchat had acquired the Ukrainian company Looksery and released the “Lenses” feature, much to the delight of Veronica’s middle school clique.</p><p>  2000年代初，MySpace和Facebook国际化Selfies的崛起，2011年的Snapchat推出了我们今天看到的迭代的开始。该应用程序提供了通过图片的快速消息传递，自拍照是在视觉上传达一个人的反应，感受和情绪的理想媒介。 2013年，牛津词典选择了“自拍照”作为今年的话语，到2015年Snapchat已经收购了乌克兰公司的Videery并发布了“镜头”功能，很高兴veronica中学集团的喜悦。</p><p>  Filters are now common across social media, though they take different forms. Instagram bundles beauty filters with its other augmented-reality facial filters, like those that add a dog’s ears and tongue to a person’s face. Snapchat offers a gallery of filters where users can swipe through beauty-enhancing effects on their selfie camera. TikTok’s beauty filter, meanwhile, is part of a setting called “Enhance,” where users can enable a standard beautification on any subject.</p><p>  过滤器现在在社交媒体上常见，尽管他们采取不同的形式。 Instagram捆绑了美容过滤器，其它增强现实面部过滤器，如那些将狗的耳朵和舌头添加到一个人的脸上。 Snapchat提供过滤器图库，用户可以通过在自拍照相机上通过美容增强效果滑动。同时，Tiktok的美容过滤器是一个名为“增强”的设置的一部分，其中用户可以在任何主题上启用标准美化。</p><p>  And they are incredibly popular. Facebook and Instagram alone claim that over 600 million people have used at least one of the AR effects associated with the company’s products: a spokesperson said that beauty filters are a “popular category” of effects but would not elaborate further. Today, according to Bloomberg, almost   a fifth of Facebook’s employees—about 10,000 people— are working on AR or VR products, and   Mark Zuckerberg recently told The Information, “I think it really makes sense for us to invest deeply to help shape what I think is going to be the next major computing platform, this combination of augmented and virtual reality.”</p><p>  他们非常受欢迎。 Facebook和Instagram仅声称，超过6亿人使用与公司产品相关的至少一个效果：发言人表示，美容过滤器是一个“流行的效果”，但不会进一步详细说明。今天，根据Bloomberg的说法，Facebook的员工几乎是10,000人 - 正在研究AR或VR产品，Mark Zuckerberg最近讲述了这些信息，“我认为我们对我们进行深入投资以帮助塑造我的信息认为将成为下一个主要的计算平台，这种增强和虚拟现实的组合。“ </p><p>    Snapchat boasts its own stunning numbers. A spokesperson said that “200 million daily active users play with or view Lenses every day to transform the way they look, augment the world around them, play games, and learn about the world,” adding that more than 90% of young people in the US, France, and the UK use the company’s AR products.</p><p>Snapchat拥有自己的令人惊叹的数字。发言人表示，“每天2亿日常活跃的用户每天玩或观看镜片，以改变他们的样子，增加他们周围的世界，玩游戏，并了解世界，”增加了90％以上的年轻人美国，法国和英国使用该公司的AR产品。</p><p>  Another measure of popularity might be how many filters exist. The majority of filters on Facebook’s various products are created by third-party users, and in the first year its tools were available, more than  400,000 creators released a total of over 1.2 million effects. By September 2020, more than 150 creator accounts had each passed the milestone of 1 billion views.</p><p>  另一个普及度量可能存在许多过滤器。 Facebook的各种产品的大部分过滤器是由第三方用户创建的，并且在第一年的工具可用，超过400,000名创造者释放了超过120万次效果。到2020年9月，超过150名创作者账户每次通过10亿意见的里程碑。</p><p>  Face filters on social media might seem technologically unimpressive compared with some other uses of AR, but Jeremy Bailenson, the founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, says the real-time puppy filters are actually quite a technological feat.</p><p>  社交媒体的面部过滤器可能似乎是技术性的，而斯坦福大学虚拟人体互动实验室的创始主任Jeremy Bailenson表示，实时小狗过滤器实际上是一个技术壮举。</p><p>  “It’s hard to do that technically,” he says. But thanks to neural networks, AI can now help achieve the kind of data processing required for real-time video altering. And the way it’s taken off in recent years surprises even longtime researchers like him.</p><p>  “技术上，很难这样做，”他说。但由于神经网络，AI现在可以帮助实现实时视频改变所需的数据处理。近年来它脱离的方式让他喜欢他的长期研究人员。</p><p>    Many people enjoy filters and lenses—both as users and creators. Caroline Rocha, a makeup artist and photographer, says that social media filters—and Instagram’s in particular—provided her a lifeline at a crucial moment. In 2018, she was at a personal low point: someone very dear to her had died, and then she suffered a stroke that resulted in temporary paralysis of her leg and permanent paralysis of her hand. Things got so overwhelming that she attempted suicide.</p><p>    许多人享受过滤器和镜头 - 因为用户和创作者。 Caroline Rocha是一个化妆艺术家和摄影师，说社交媒体过滤器和Instagram特别是在一个关键时刻提供了她的一个生命线。在2018年，她处于个人低点：曾经非常珍贵的人死了，然后她遭受了一阵卒中，导致她的腿部暂时瘫痪和她的手永久麻痹。事情变得如此压倒，以至于她试图自杀。</p><p>  “I just wanted to come out of my reality,” she says. “My reality was dark. It was deep. I passed my days inside four walls.” Filters felt like a breakthrough. They gave her “the chance to travel … to experiment, to try on makeup, to try a piece of jewelry,” she says. “It opened a big window for me.”</p><p>  “我只是想出我的现实，”她说。 “我的现实是黑暗的。这是深刻的。我把我的日子经过四堵墙。“过滤器感觉就像一个突破。他们给了她“旅行的机会......试验，试着进行化妆，尝试一块珠宝，”她说。 “它为我打开了一个大窗户。”</p><p>  She had studied art history in school, and Instagram filters felt like a deeply human and artistic world, full of opportunity and connection. She became friends with AR creators whose aesthetic spoke to her. Through that, she became a “filters influencer,” though she says she hates that term: she would try different filters and critique them for a growing audience of followers. Eventually, she started creating filters herself.</p><p>  她在学校学习了艺术历史，而instagram过滤器感觉像一个深深的人类和艺术世界，充满了机会和联系。她成为ar Creators的朋友，他的美学与她说话。通过这一点，她成为“过滤器影响者”，虽然她说她讨厌这个词：她会尝试不同的过滤器，并为追随者的越来越多的受众批评他们。最终，她开始自己创建过滤器。 </p><p>  Rocha became connected with creators like   Marc Wakefield, an artist and AR designer who specializes in dark, fantastical effects. (One of his hits is “ Hole in the Head,” in which a see-through hole replaces the subject’s face.) The community was “so close and so helpful,” she says—“beautiful,” even. She had no technical expertise when she started creating AR effects, and spent hours poring over help documents with help from others.</p><p>Rocha与Marc Wakefield，艺术家和AR设计师等创造者相连，专门从事黑暗，奇妙的效果。 （他的一个命中是“头部的洞”，其中透视孔取代了受试者的脸。）社区是“如此接近，”甚至“美丽，”甚至。当她开始创造AR效果时，她没有技术专长，并花费几小时与其他人的帮助有关帮助文件。</p><p>  Her first viral filter was called “Alive”: it overlaid the electrical pulse of a heartbeat right across the face of its subject. After a moment, the line distorts into a heart that encircles one eye before flashes of colored light illuminate the screen. Rocha says Alive was an homage to her own story of mental illness.</p><p>  她的第一个病毒过滤器被称为“活着”：它覆盖了对其主题的脸部右侧的心跳的电脉冲。片刻之后，该线扭曲成一颗心脏，在彩色光线闪烁屏幕之前环绕一只眼睛。 Rocha说，活着对她自己的精神疾病故事是一种致敬。</p><p>  Rocha’s experience is not unusual: many people enjoy the playfulness of the technology. Facebook describes AR effects as a way to “make any moment more fun to share,” while Snapchat says the goal of Lens “is to provide fun and playful creative effects that allow our community to express themselves freely.”</p><p>  Rocha的经历并不罕见：很多人都喜欢该技术的乐趣。 Facebook描述了AR效果作为“让任何时刻更有趣分享”的方式，而Snapchat说镜头的目标是提供有趣和俏皮的创造效果，让我们的社区自由表达自己。“</p><p>  But Rocha has changed her view. This artistic conception of filters now seems idealistic to her, not least because it is not necessarily representative of how the majority of people use filters. Artistic or funny filters may be popular, but they are dwarfed by beauty filters.</p><p>  但罗奇改变了她的观点。这种艺术概念的过滤器现在对她来说似乎是理想主义，尤其是因为它不一定代表大多数人如何使用过滤器。艺术或有趣的过滤器可能很受欢迎，但它们是由美容过滤器的矮化。</p><p>  Facebook and Snapchat were both hesitant to provide any data breaking out filters that are solely appearance enhancing from those that are more novel. Facebook’s creators categorize their own filters into 17 ambiguous buckets, whose names include “Appearance,” “Selfies,” “Moods,” and “Camera styles.” “Appearance” is in the top 10 most popular categories, said the Facebook spokesperson, but refused to elaborate further.</p><p>  Facebook和Snapchat都犹豫不决，提供任何数据破坏过滤器，这些过滤器完全从更加小说中加强了那些。 Facebook的创造者将自己的过滤器分为17个含糊的桶，其名称包括“外观”，“自拍”，“情绪”，“情绪”和“相机样式”。 Facebook发言人表示，“外观”是十大最受欢迎的类别，但拒绝阐述进一步。</p><p>  Rocha says she sees many women on social media using filters nonstop. “They refuse to be seen without these filters, because in their mind they think that they look like that,” she says. “It became, for me, a bit sick.”</p><p>  Rocha表示，她使用过滤器不间断地看到许多社交媒体上的女性。 “他们在没有这些过滤器的情况下拒绝看到，因为在他们的脑海里，他们认为他们看起来像那样，”她说。 “对我而言，有点恶心。”</p><p>  In fact, she struggled with it herself. “I’ve always fought against this kind of fakeness,” she says, but “I’d say, ‘Okay, I have to change my picture. I have to make my nose thinner and give myself a big lip because I feel ugly.’ And I was like, ‘Whoa, Whoa, no, I’m not like that. I want to feel beautiful without changing these things.’”</p><p>  事实上，她自己挣扎了。 “我一直对抗这种魅力，”她说，但“我会说，”好的，我必须改变我的照片。我必须让我的鼻子更薄，给自己一个大嘴唇，因为我感到难看。“我就像，'哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇我想在没有改变这些东西的情况下感到美丽。“ </p><p>  She says the beauty-obsessed culture of AR filters has become increasingly disappointing: “It has changed because, in my point of view ... the new generation of creators just want money and fame.”</p><p>她说，迷恋的艾滋病杂交文化越来越令人失望：“它发生了变化，因为，在我的观点中......新一代创造者只是想要金钱和名声。”</p><p>  “There is a bad mood in the community,” she says. “It’s all about fame and number of followers, and I think it’s sad, because we are making art, and it’s about our emotions … It’s very sad what’s happening right now.”</p><p>  “在社区中有一种不好的情绪，”她说。 “这完全是关于名人的名气和追随者的数量，我认为这很伤心，因为我们正在制作艺术，这是关于我们的情感......现在发生了很糟糕的事情。”</p><p>    Veronica, the teenager, sees the same patterns. “If someone is completely portraying themselves in one filter and has only posted photos in a filter meeting all of the beauty standards and gaining followers and making money off of the beauty standard that we have right now—I don’t know if that’s, like, genius or if that’s terrible,” she says.</p><p>    青少年veronica看到相同的模式。 “如果有人在一个过滤器中完全描绘自己，并且只在过滤器中发布照片，符合所有美容标准和获得追随者并赚取我们现在所拥有的美容标准的资金 - 我不知道吗？ ，天才或者如果这是可怕的，“她说。</p><p>  Claire Pescott is a researcher at the University of South Wales who studies the behavior of preteens on social media. In focus groups, she’s observed a gender difference when it comes to filters. “All of the boys said, ‘These are really fun. I like to put on these funny ears, I like to share them with my friends and we have a laugh,’” she says. Young girls, however, see AR filters primarily as a tool for beautification: “[The girls] were all saying things like, ‘I put this filter on because I have flawless skin. It takes away my scars and spots.’ And these were children of 10 and 11.”</p><p>  Claire Pescott是南威尔士大学的研究员，他研究了Preteens在社交媒体上的行为。在焦点小组中，她在过滤器时观察到性别差异。 “所有的男孩都说，”这些都很有趣。我喜欢穿上这些有趣的耳朵，我喜欢与我的朋友分享他们，我们笑了，“”她说。然而，年轻女孩主要看AR过滤器，主要作为美化的工具：“女孩”都说的事情，“我把这个过滤器打开，因为我有完美的皮肤。它带走了我的伤疤和斑点。“这些是10和11的孩子。”</p><p>  “I don’t think it’s just filtering your actual image,” she says. “It’s filtering your whole life.”</p><p>  “我不认为这只是过滤你的实际形象，”她说。 “这是过滤你的一生。”</p><p>  And this change is only just beginning. AR filters on social media are part of a   rapidly growing suite of automated digital beauty technologies. The app Facetune has been downloaded over 60 million times and exists simply for easy video and photo editing.   Presets are a recent phenomenon in which creators—and established influencers in particular—create and sell custom filters in Adobe Lightroom. Even Zoom has a “touch up my appearance” feature that gives the appearance of smoother skin in video calls. M any have heralded the option to buff your appearance as a low-effort savior during the pandemic.</p><p>  这种变化才刚刚开始。社交媒体上的AR过滤器是快速增长的自动化数字美容技术套件的一部分。 App Facetune已下载超过6000万次，并仅限于轻松视频和照片编辑。预设是最近的一种现象，其中创造者和建立了特别是在Adobe Lightoom中创建和销售自定义过滤器的影响。甚至缩放甚至有一个“触摸我的外观”功能，可以在视频通话中出现光滑的皮肤。 M任何已预示着在大流行期间将外表视为低努力的救主的选项。</p><p>    During our conversations, I asked Veronica to define what an “Instagram Face” looks like. She replied quickly and confidently: “Small nose, big eyes, clear skin, big lips.”</p><p>    在我们的谈话中，我要求Veronica定义什么“Instagram面部”的样子。她快速而自信地回答：“小鼻子，大眼睛，清澈的皮肤，大嘴唇。” </p><p>  This aesthetic relies on categories of AR effects called “deformation” and “face distortion.” As opposed to the Zoom-like touch-up that simply blends skin tones or saturates eye color, distortion effects allow creators to easily change the shape and size of certain facial features, creating things like a “bigger lip,” a “lifted eyebrow,” or a “narrower jaw,” according to Rocha.</p><p>这种审美依赖于称为“变形”的AR效应和“面部失真”的类别。与简单地混合皮肤色调或饱和眼睛颜色的缩放样触摸相反，失真效果允许创造者容易地改变某些面部特征的形状和大小，从而创造出“更大的唇”，“抬起眉毛”， “或者是”罗氏的“较窄的下巴”。</p><p>  Teenagers Sophia and Veronica say they prefer distortion filters. One of Sophia’s favorites makes her look like singer and influencer  Madison Beer. “It has these massive lashes that make my eyes look beautiful. My lips triple in size and my nose is tinier,” she says. But she’s cautious: “Nobody looks like that unless you are Madison Beer or someone who has a really, really good nose job.”</p><p>  青少年索菲亚和veronica表示他们更喜欢失真过滤器。索菲亚的最爱之一让她看起来像歌手和影响者麦迪逊啤酒。 “它有这些大规模的睫毛，让我的眼睛看起来很漂亮。我的嘴唇大小，我的鼻子很多，“她说。但她很谨慎：“除非你是麦迪逊啤酒或有真正，真正的鼻子工作的人，否则没有人看起来。”</p><p>  Veronica’s “ideal” filter, meanwhile, is a distortion filter called Naomi Beauty on Snapchat, which she says all her friends use. “It is one of the top filters for two reasons,” she says. “It clears your skin and it makes your eyes huge.”</p><p>  与此同时，Veronica的“理想”过滤器是一个叫做Naomi Beauty的Snapchat的失真过滤器，她说她所有的朋友都使用。 “它是顶级过滤器之一，有两个原因，”她说。 “它清除了你的皮肤，它让你的眼睛巨大。”</p><p>   There are thousands of distortion filters available on major social platforms, with names like La Belle, Natural Beauty, and Boss Babe. Even the goofy Big Mouth on Snapchat, one of social media’s most popular filters, is made with distortion effects.</p><p>   主要的社交平台上有数千个失真过滤器，名称像La Belle，自然美和Boss Babe。即使是Snapchat上的笨重的大口，也是社交媒体最流行的过滤器之一，是用扭曲效应制作的。</p><p>  In October 2019, Facebook banned distortion effects because of “public debate about potential negative impact.” Awareness of body dysmorphia was rising, and a filter called   FixMe, which allowed users to mark up their faces as a cosmetic surgeon might, had sparked a surge of criticism for encouraging plastic surgery. But in August 2020, the effects were re-released with a new policy banning filters that explicitly promoted surgery. Effects that resize facial features, however, are still allowed. (When asked about the decision, a spokesperson directed me to   Facebook’s press release from that time.)</p><p>  2019年10月，由于“关于潜在负面影响的公开辩论”，Facebook禁止扭曲效果。对身体痛经的认识​​正在上升，并且一个叫做FixMe的过滤器，它允许用户将他们的脸部标记为化妆品外科医生，这引起了鼓励整形手术的批评激增。但是，在2020年8月，通过明确促进手术的新政策禁止过滤器重新发布了这些效果。然而，仍然允许调整面部特征的效果。 （当被问及该决定时，发言人将我从那时里指向Facebook的新闻稿。）</p><p>  When the effects were re-released, Rocha decided to take a stand and began posting condemnations of body shaming online. She committed to stop using deformation effects herself unless they are clearly humorous or dramatic rather than beautifying and says she didn’t want to “be responsible” for the harmful effects some filters were having on women: some, she says, have looked into getting plastic surgery that makes them look like their filtered self.</p><p>  当效果重新发布时，Rocha决定采取立场，并开始在线发布身体的谴责。她致力于停止使用变形效果，除非他们显然是幽默或戏剧性的而不是美化，并说她不想“负责”对有害影响有些过滤器都有妇女：有些，她说，看了看了整形手术使它们看起来像他们过滤的自我。</p><p>    Krista Crotty is a clinical education specialist at the Emily Program, a leading center on eating disorders and mental health based in St. Paul, Minnesota. Much of her job over the past five years has focused on educating patients about how to consume media in a healthier way. She says that when patients present themselves differently online and in person, she sees an increase in anxiety. “People are putting up information about themselves—whether it’s size, shape, weight, whatever—that isn’t anything like what they actually look like,” she says. “In between that authentic self and digital self lives a lot of anxiety, because it’s not who you really are. You don’t look like the photos that have been filtered.”</p><p>    Krista Crotty是一名艾米莉计划的临床教育专家，该专家是一家位于明尼苏达州圣保罗的饮食障碍和心理健康的领先中心。在过去五年中，她的大部分工作都集中在教育患者患者如何以更健康的方式消耗媒体。她说，当患者在网上和亲自出现不同的方式时，她会增加焦虑。 “人们正在提出有关自己的信息 - 无论是尺寸，形状，重量，无论如何 - 并不像他们实际上的样子，”她说。 “在那个真实的自我和数字自我之间生活了很多焦虑，因为它不是你真正的。你看起来不像被过滤的照片。“ </p><p>    For young people, who are still working out who they are, navigating between a digital and authentic self can be particularly complicated, and it’s not clear what the long-term consequences will be.</p><p>对于仍然努力解决他们的年轻人，在数字和真实的自我之间导航可能特别复杂，并且不清楚的是长期后果将是什么。</p><p>  “Identity online is kind of like an artifact, almost,” says Claire Pescott, the researcher from the University of South Wales. “It’s a kind of projected image of yourself.”</p><p>  “南威尔士大学研究员Claire Pescott说：”身份在线就像神器一样。“ “这是你自己的一种预定的形象。”</p><p>  Pescott’s observations of children have led her to conclude that filters can have a positive impact on them. “They can kind of try out different personas,” she explains. “They have these ‘of the moment’ identities that they could change, and they can evolve with different groups.”</p><p>  Pescott对儿童的观察导致她得出结论，过滤器可以对它们产生积极的影响。 “他们可以尝试不同的角色，”她解释道。 “他们有这些”时刻“的身份，他们可以改变，他们可以与不同的群体发展。”</p><p>    But she doubts that all young people are able to understand how filters affect their sense of self. And she’s concerned about the way social media platforms grant immediate validation and feedback in the form of likes and comments. Young girls, she says, have particular difficulty differentiating between filtered photos and ordinary ones.</p><p>    但她怀疑所有年轻人都能理解过滤器如何影响他们的自我意识。她担心社交媒体平台授予立即验证和以喜欢和评论的形式授予验证和反馈的方式。她说，年轻的女孩，在过滤的照片和普通的照片之间存在特殊困难。</p><p>  Pescott’s research also revealed that while children are now often taught about online behavior, they receive “very little education” about filters. Their safety training “was linked to overt physical dangers of social media, not the emotional, more nuanced side of social media,” she says, “which I think is more dangerous.”</p><p>  Pescott的研究还透露，虽然孩子们现在经常教过在线行为，但他们会收到关于过滤器的“非常小的教育”。他们的安全培训“与社交媒体的明显身体危险有关，而不是社交媒体的情感，更细微的一面，”她说：“我认为更危险。”</p><p>  Bailenson expects that we can learn about some of these emotional unknowns from established VR research. In virtual environments, people’s behavior changes with the physical characteristics of their avatar, a phenomenon called  the Proteus effect. Bailenson found, for example, that people who had taller avatars were more likely to behave confidently than those with shorter avatars. “We know that visual representations of the self, when used in a meaningful way during social interactions, do change our attitudes and behaviors,” he says.</p><p>  Bailenson预计，我们可以了解来自已建立的VR研究的这些情绪化未知数。在虚拟环境中，人们的行为随着其头像的物理特征而变化，一种称为蛋白质效应的现象。例如，巴利森森发现，那些拥有更高的头像的人更有可能自信地表现得比具有较短的头像更短的人。 “我们知道自我的视觉表现，在社交互动期间以有意义的方式使用，确实改变了我们的态度和行为，”他说。</p><p>  But sometimes those actions can play on stereotypes.  A well-known study from 1988 found that athletes who wore black uniforms were more aggressive and violent while playing sports than those wearing white uniforms. And this translates to the digital world:  one recent study showed that video game players who used avatars of the opposite sex actually behaved in a way that was gender stereotypical.</p><p>  但有时这些行动可以在刻板印象上发挥作用。从1988年的一项知名研究发现，穿着黑色制服的运动员比穿着白制服的人更具侵略性和暴力的运动。这转化为数字世界：最近的一项研究表明，使用异性的头像的视频游戏玩家实际上表现出一种性别陈规定型的方式。 </p><p>  Bailenson says we should expect to see similar behavior on social media as people adopt masks based on filtered versions of their own faces, rather than entirely different characters. “The world of filtered video, in my opinion—and we haven’t tested this yet—is going to behave very similarly to the world of filtered avatars,” he says.</p><p>Bailenson表示，随着人们采用基于筛选版本的脸部，而不是完全不同的角色，我们应该期望在社交媒体上看到类似的行为。 “过滤视频的世界，在我看来 - 我们还没有测试过这个，它会非常类似于过滤的头像世界，”他说。</p><p>    Considering the power and pervasiveness of filters, there is very little hard research about their impact—and even fewer guardrails around their use.</p><p>    考虑到过滤器的力量和普遍性，对他们的影响很小，甚至更少的卫兵在他们使用时。</p><p>  I asked Bailenson, who is the father of two young girls, how he thinks about his daughters’ use of AR filters. “It’s a real tough one,” he says, “because it goes against everything that we’re taught in all of our basic cartoons, which is ‘Be yourself.’”</p><p>  我问Bailenson，谁是两个年轻女孩的父亲，他如何考虑他的女儿使用AR过滤器。 “这是一个真正的艰难的一个，”他说，“因为它反对我们在我们所有的基本漫画中所教导的一切，这是”做你自己“的。”</p><p>  Bailenson also says that playful use is different from real-time, constant augmentation of ourselves, and understanding what these different contexts mean for kids is important.</p><p>  Bailenson还表示，俏皮使用与实时，不断增强的人不同，并了解这些不同的背景对孩子意味着什么很重要。</p><p>    What few regulations and restrictions there are on filter use rely on companies to police themselves. Facebook’s filters, for example, have to go through an approval process that, according to the spokesperson, uses “a combination of human and automated systems to review effects as they are submitted for publishing.” They are reviewed for certain issues, such as hate speech or nudity, and users are also able to report filters, which then get manually reviewed.</p><p>    过滤器使用的法规和限制有多大的限制和限制依赖于公司来警察。例如，Facebook的过滤器必须通过批准程序，根据发言人，使用“人类和自动化系统的组合来审查效果，因为他们提交出版。”他们被审查了某些问题，例如仇恨语音或裸露，用户也能够报告过滤器，然后手动审核。</p><p>  The company says it consults regularly with expert groups, such as the National Eating Disorders Association and the JED Foundation, a mental-health nonprofit.</p><p>  该公司表示，它定期与专家组进行磋商，例如国家饮食障碍协会和jed基金会，一个心理健康非营利组织。</p><p>  &#34;We know people may feel pressure to look a certain way on social media, and we&#39;re taking steps to address this across Instagram and Facebook,&#34; said a statement from Instagram. &#34;We know effects can play a role, so we ban ones that clearly promote eating disorders or that encourage potentially dangerous cosmetic surgery procedures… And we&#39;re working on more products to help reduce the pressure people may feel on our platforms, like the opt</p><p>  ＆＃34;我们知道人们可能会感受到社交媒体上某种方式的压力，我们＆＃39;重新采取措施在Instagram和Facebook上解决这个问题，＆＃34;来自Instagram的声明。 ＆＃34;我们知道效果可以发挥作用，所以我们禁止清楚地促进饮食疾病或鼓励潜在的危险化妆品手术手术程序......以及我们努力减少更多产品的产品，以帮助减少人们感受到的压力平台，喜欢选择 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/02/1021635/beauty-filters-young-girls-augmented-reality-social-media/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/02/1021635/beauty-filters-young-girls-augmented-reality-social-media/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/了解/">#了解</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/impact/">#impact</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/过滤器/">#过滤器</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
