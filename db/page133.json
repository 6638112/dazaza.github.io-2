Today, the company  announced that it\u2019s acquiring Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform for an undisclosed sum. This means Amazon will now have a hand in hosting podcasters\u2019 shows as well as selling ads against them because Art19 operates an ad marketplace that targets and inserts ads into programming. We\u2019ve reached out to Amazon Music to learn more about what this acquisition might mean for podcasters who host on the service and will update if we hear back.\n This is a major step for Amazon as it looks to take on a bigger role in the podcasting world. Amazon Music only started offering podcasts in  September last year, as did Audible  in October. But in the time since, Amazon Music has  acquired Wondery, one of the last major independent podcast networks. Today\u2019s acquisition gives it a fuller role in the industry. Not only will it make content through Wondery and distribute shows through its app, but now, Amazon can host those podcasts, as well as third parties\u2019, and sell ads against them. This gives Amazon even more data about what\u2019s happening both inside and outside its app. (Amazon Music already  sells audio ads, so Art19\u2019s business might complement that work.)\n We\u2019ve seen this same scenario already play out with Spotify. The company started out making content-based acquisitions, like that of  Gimlet Media and  Parcast, but then  acquired Megaphone, an Art19 competitor. In that case, Spotify has focused on bringing a proprietary ad-serving technology to the platform, called  Streaming Ad Insertion, in order to encourage podcasters to move over to the hosting service and take advantage of its ad marketplace. Other companies in the space have also taken a similar position. iHeartMedia  acquired Triton Digital, and SXM Media acquired Midroll, an ad-serving marketplace and platform,  in July. As  we said in February, the podcasting business isn\u2019t only about the flashy exclusive content deals, but who can sell and monetize shows.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:12:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "amazon,\u64ad\u5ba2,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u6258\u7ba1,acquires", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u83b7\u53d6Art19\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2\u6258\u7ba1\u548c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u672a\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u603b\u548c ", "title_en": "Amazon acquires Art19, a major podcast hosting and monetization platform, for an undisclosed sum", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549391/amazon-music-art19-hosting-platform-advertisers?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["amazon", "\u64ad\u5ba2", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u6258\u7ba1", "acquires"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068114, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Mckeeman\u8868\u5355\u662f\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\u5b83\u7531\u8fbe\u7279\u8305\u65af\u5b66\u9662\u6bd4\u5c14\u9ea6\u514b\u514b\u66fc\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684Backus-Naur\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u5b57\u7b26\u3002\n          Unicode\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9U + 0020\u7528\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\rUnicode\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9U + 000A\u7528\u4f5c\u6362\u884c\u7b26\u3002\n                \u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c4\u5219\u90fd\u7531\u6362\u884c\u7b26\u5206\u9694\u3002\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e00\u884c\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7f29\u8fdb\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\n      \u5982\u679c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u884c\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\uff06\uff0334;\uff0c\u90a3\u6761\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u3002\n    \u6bcf\u4e2a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u90fd\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7f29\u8fdb\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u65b0\u7ebf\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002\n      \u7269\u54c1\u7528\u7a7a\u683c\u5206\u9694\u3002\u9879\u76ee\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u5b57\u6216\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u3002\n        \u9664\u4e8632\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2aUnicode\u7801\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u5355\u5f15\u53f7\u5185\u3002\u4efb\u4f55Unicode\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9\u7684\u516d\u7aef\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u5355\u5f15\u53f7\u5185\u3002\u516d\u7801\u53ef\u4ee5\u5305\u542b4,5\u62166\u4e2a\u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u6570\u5b57\u3002 \n\u516d\u89d2\u7801  \uff06\uff0334; 10\uff06\uff0334; \u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236  \u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u516d\u89d2\u516d\u89d2\u516d\u89d2  \u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236\u5341\u516d\u8fdb\u5236  \u4e00\u4e2a\u8303\u56f4\u88ab\u6307\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5355\u8eab\uff0ca\u3002 \u548c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u8eab\u4eba\u58eb\u3002 \u6587\u5b57\u8303\u56f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u540e\u8ddf - \u548c\u8981\u6392\u9664\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u3002  \u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u7b26\u5305\u88f9\u5728\uff06\uff0334; \u9664\u4e8632\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\uff06\uff0334\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u4efb\u4f55Unicode\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9; \u3002 \u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u70b9\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u3002 ", "note_en": "McKeeman Form is a notation for expressing grammars.

Pass; no license required for learning.\n Additional licensing is required to obtain the Xbox Extensions to build games optimized for Xbox consoles or  publish games to the Microsoft catalog for any platform.\n      Windows game development has a history going back 40+ years which means that there have been and still are many options to build games that reach gamers on PC. The GDK is an evolution to the Win32 legacy, to unify the app model between Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, and now Cloud Gaming to enable game developers to reach even more gamers on more devices, with less effort. Microsoft Gaming Services are agnostic across many ecosystems and the GDK is sharing the app model across MILLIONS of devices.\n Q: How do I build next-generation games for the Xbox App on Windows 10 and Xbox Game Pass for PC?\n Using  Win32 + GDK is the primary, supported app model to build games for Xbox console, Xbox Game Pass (both Xbox and PC), and  Xbox Game Streaming**.\n Key Feature is that only Win32 + GDK fully supports all Microsoft Gameplay Services (Xbox Live identity, multiplayer, chat, leaderboards, achievements, commerce, etc.), and is  required for Xbox Game Pass(1) on both console and PC.\n For developers building Win32 games on PC today, Win32 + GDK builds on the Win32 C/C++ programming models to unify development across Xbox consoles and Windows 10 PCs with the Microsoft Game Development Kit ( GDK).\n (1) Requires software and licensing which only available via an NDA Xbox program (e.g. ID@Xbox program).\n Q: How do I run a GDK game built for the Xbox App on Windows 10 or Xbox Game Pass for PC on Xbox Consoles?\n Xbox console development requires the \u201cMicrosoft Game Development Kit with Xbox Extensions (GDKX)\u201d. Games will need to retarget and rebuild for Xbox One or Xbox Series X|S with the GDKX installed.\n You need to download, install, and retarget your project for Xbox consoles using the GDKX\n The GDKX is currently only available under confidential license within an NDA Xbox program (e.g. ID@Xbox).\n The GDKX is just a bundled installer of the GDK + Xbox Extensions. Building a game with the GDK shares around ~80% of the same interfaces, but does not include the Xbox environment APIs and tools included in the Xbox Extensions.\n The primary difference between games built with the GDK and the GDKX is the interaction with the Xbox graphics driver and DirectX12 Shader Compiler.\n For developers building Xbox One games today, Win32 + GDK is a direct replacement for the WinRT-based Exclusive Resource Application (ERA) app model using the  XDK, introduced on Xbox One; Xbox 360 developers similarly migrated to ERA in 2013.\n  The Universal Windows Platform was introduced in 2015 for Windows 10 as a bridge between all the devices in the Windows family (Windows Phone, Surface, Windows PCs, and Xbox One*).\n Key feature for is open development and self-publishing to  Windows Mixed Reality (MR) or the Microsoft Store on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox; particularly well suited for interactive media applications.\n  UWP apps and games are community-supported only; partners inside Xbox managed programs (Xbox, Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Game Streaming) should use Microsoft Win32 + GDK.\n   In the \u201cWhen to use the GDK\u201d section above, we cover the scenarios for which the GDK was designed to provide a modern app model that flows across Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, and Cloud Gaming.\n In this section, we cover some of the more practical, basic questions that are also answered in the documentation, but come up frequently from developers getting started with this app model.\n  Three major GDK release branches a year with a mix of new features and fixes (flexibly April, June, and October to align with game development cycles).\n GDK updates can release in parallel as needed, on separate branches, focused on reliability, stability, and fixes. Developers can take updates vs. another major version to reduce churn and risk of breaking changes affecting compatibility (e.g. April Update #1, April Update #2, April Update #3, June Update #1, etc).\n  A public version of the release notes that does not contain confidential information about Xbox features is under development.\n A full version of the release notes with public + confidential information is available as part of the GDKX release and will be available for the public GDK sometime after June 2021; they will be published to the GitHub repo ( http://aka.ms/gdk)\n Q: What are some of key elements missing in the GDK that is needed to build games for Xbox consoles?\n The Xbox developer environment APIs and Tools required to target and build games that run on Xbox consoles, currently only bundled as the GDKX installer package.\n The Xbox graphics driver and related DirectX 12 components (e.g. Shader Compiler) required to build binaries that work with proprietary Xbox hardware and software interfaces.\n The corresponding confidential documentation for Xbox environment APIs and Tools; though some topics are only discoverable with access to the GDKX, most topics are available as public docs (~60%) or are discoverable via the table of contents as a redirect to the confidential documentation libraries (~35%).", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:12:05", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Microsoft ( MSFT) launched a broadside against rivals Apple ( AAPL) and Google ( GOOG,  GOOGL) on Thursday, announcing that the  next version of Windows, called Windows 11, will feature an app store that lets developers keep 100% of the revenue from sales of their apps.\n That\u2019s a massive departure from the policies Apple and Google have in place that require app developers who use their stores to pay 30% fees on the sale of apps and in-app purchases.\n \u201cWindows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. \u201cA platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation. It\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing new store commerce models and policies.\u201d\n The move is certain to rankle executives at both Apple and Google, which are facing antitrust investigations into their app store practices.\n Apple is awaiting a ruling in an  antitrust case brought by Epic Games, in which the \u201cFortnite\u201d developer accused the iPhone maker of abusing its market power over the App Store by forcing developers to use its own payment system and fork over the associated fees.\n Google, meanwhile, faces a similar lawsuit from Epic and is expected to get slapped with a lawsuit from a collection of state attorneys general for its app store policies.\n  This isn\u2019t the first time Microsoft has called out its rivals and their app stores. The company has criticized Apple\u2019s policies in the past, specifically Apple\u2019s policy of taking a share of revenue from Microsoft apps purchased through the Apple App Store.\n More recently, Microsoft sparred with Apple over its desire to get its xCloud cloud gaming platform onto the iPhone via a native app. Apple has pushed back, hampering Microsoft\u2019s cloud gaming ambitions and forcing it to make users rely on a browser-style app.\n That led Microsoft to meet and lodge a complaint with members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee during the body\u2019s investigation into Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.\n   Microsoft also took aim at Apple in the iPhone maker\u2019s battle with \u201cFortnite\u201d developer Epic Games. In that instance,  Microsoft filed a statement of support for Epic in its fight to prevent Apple withholding iOS support for Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine.\n Epic initially sued Apple and Google after the two companies removed \u201cFornite\u201d from their respective app stores. Apple and Google argue that Epic implemented an update that added a separate payment system allowing consumers to circumvent Apple or Google\u2019s payment services. That effectively cut out Apple and Google\u2019s 30% app store fees.\n Epic\u2019s fight with Apple wrapped up earlier this month and a ruling is expected before the end of the summer.\n  With its decision to allow developers to use their own payment systems, Microsoft is sending a signal to the global developer community that it is willing to play by their rules. That could help the company as it seeks to build out its app store and drive more business for Windows.\n While Microsoft was caught flat-footed in the smartphone wars, its moves with the Windows 11 Microsoft Store could give it the kind of boost from developers that it needs to begin taking market share from Apple and Google in the fight for app store supremacy. It\u2019s now up to Apple and Google to respond.\n   Got a tip?

conventional wisdom driving the minimum wage debate\n  I was 16 when I got my first job at a McDonald\u2019s in upstate New York. It was the fall of 2014; I was   paid $8 an hour. It was around this time that I started thinking of my purchases in terms of time. A gallon of milk was around $3, slightly less than half an hour of labor. The cost of the average meal at McDonald\u2019s was around $7, meaning that when a customer ordered a large Big Mac meal, they were spending what would take me just under an hour to earn. It would cost about $35 to fill up my car with gas \u2014 around four and a half hours of labor.\n In January of 2015, New York state raised the minimum wage from $8 to $8.75, and our general manager responded by cutting every crew member\u2019s hours significantly. The mid-tier managers would say stuff like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but because they increased the minimum wage, we can\u2019t afford to give everyone the same hours.\u201d\n For the next week or so, everyone was working so few hours that they were actually making less at the $8.75 hourly rate than they would\u2019ve been making under their full schedule at $8. The lesson from management was clear: Raising the minimum wage was actually bad because businesses would be forced to cut hours.\n  After about two weeks or so, however, everyone\u2019s hours went back to normal. The timing of the minimum wage increase just so happened to coincide with a decline in business. As I would later learn, the week or two after the winter holidays was always the slowest part of the year at our store. Busy holiday shoppers were no longer stopping off at McDonald\u2019s to get quick food, and for the beginning of January, people were still attempting to stick by their New Year\u2019s resolutions of eating healthy. Turns out, the cutting of our hours was due to a natural, predictable dip in business.\n Fast forward a year. I was 17, still working at McDonald\u2019s, and the minimum wage has just lifted again from $8.75 to $9. It is, in hindsight, a remarkably tiny improvement, but once again, the general manager responded by cutting hours. The same explanation was given: \u201cSorry, these new wage increases are really forcing our hand.\u201d And, of course: \u201cIt\u2019s basic economics: This is just what happens.\u201d Like last time, everyone\u2019s hours returned to normal after the first two weeks of January. Up until 2019, I came back to this McDonald\u2019s during my summer and winter breaks in college, and every January, the exact same thing happened.\n  When discussing the possibility of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, it\u2019s important to remember that so much of what we learn about a minimum wage increase is bullshit. When it comes to even the slightest of wage increases, companies will make a big show of how much this is hurting them, and we all just kind of accept it unthinkingly.\n Back in 2018, the Tim Hortons franchise in Canada responded to a mandatory $2 wage increase by  reducing employee benefits. Based on the news coverage of the event, you would think they simply had no choice. It was accepted, at face value, that company executives were honest in their claims that the government forced their hands despite the reality that their profit margins were  pretty fucking good. They were still turning a profit and were in no actual danger of going bankrupt; they just needed people to associate higher wages with a loss of benefits and the threat of losing their jobs altogether.\n This argument against raising the minimum wage is so firmly ingrained in our culture that people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a claim that needs to be proven. They think it\u2019s a basic truth. As a result, advocates who have spent years researching the effects of raising the minimum wage will be met with quips like, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand basic math?\u201d\n The assumption is that math is on their side here. The assumption is so firmly ingrained in their minds that they don\u2019t feel like they have  to defend it. It just is. Despite the fact that there  isn\u2019t actually much evidence to suggest that raising the minimum wage will lead to job loss, this assertion is  a basic reality  to a lot of conservatives, moderates, and even liberals. When leftists argue in favor of $15 an hour, they are arguing against basic laws of nature. They are arguing for something that would obviously collapse the economy; don\u2019t they know that? It\u2019s basic math .\n American society is uniquely designed to enforce the mindset that helping the lower class in any significant way is impossible.\n The reality is that a major minimum wage increase would very likely provide a massive boost to the economy. A major increase in spending money for millions of Americans would lead to a boost in customer spending, which would more than make up for the initial sting of having to pay employees more. It\u2019s been proven, after all, that money given to low-income people and the middle class is distributed back into the economy  at a much higher percentage than money given to the rich. With fast-food employees making $15 an hour, that would also give other underpaid professions \u2014 like teachers and paramedics \u2014 significantly more leverage to advocate for wage increases themselves. The very idea of what constitutes a good wage would shift significantly in workers\u2019 favor.\n  When opponents of the $15 an hour debate with advocates, there is a frustrating lack of effort put into their talking points. Some may point out that a fast-food worker would then make about as much as a paramedic, as if the obvious takeaway isn\u2019t that we should be paying paramedics more as well. Others may argue that an increased minimum wage will lead to massive inflation, as if the evidence for that isn\u2019t  incredibly shaky at best. They will argue that if someone wants to be paid a living wage, that person should just learn a skill and find a real  job, ignoring the obvious counterpoint that someone is always going to have to hold those low-paying jobs in order for society to function.\n People expect teenagers to take these low-wage jobs, claiming a high school student doesn\u2019t need a living wage while they\u2019re still financially dependent on parents or extended family. But this logic is inherently flawed. Not only is it absurd to expect teens to fill these service jobs at all hours of the day, but their argument is also based on loaded assumptions that young people don\u2019t need to provide for loved ones or themselves.\n Even if they come from loving families, high school students should  be able to meaningfully save up for college or adult life in general. That\u2019s not possible today. I worked for around two years at McDonald\u2019s before going to college, and the money I managed to save up was gone by the end of the first semester.\n I spent a long time blaming myself for being bad with money, but the truth is I was never really a big spender. I was an antisocial person with inexpensive habits. I wasn\u2019t going out to bars every weekend; I was staying home and reading books and watching TV. Still, by my second semester, I had to find a part-time job just to get by. It was only in my third year, when I started working as a freelance editor earning around $25 an hour, that I was able to start saving up money in a meaningful way. I had safety nets \u2014 if worse came to worst, I could always ask my parents for money \u2014 but so many people don\u2019t.\n This is how bad things have gotten: In the 1950s, the minimum wage was supposed to be enough for a person to support their family; today the minimum wage is enough for a college student to make it until their next paycheck, not much more. Unfortunately, a lot of people in this country think this is how it should be.\n  American society is uniquely designed to enforce and accept the mindset that helping the lower class in any significant way is impossible, that even if we tried  to help them, it would just backfire and hurt them even more. Everything about this country is designed to stifle class consciousness.\n For instance, we\u2019re one of the only countries in the world that doesn\u2019t include sales taxes in the price of an item. A lot of Americans don\u2019t realize this, but it\u2019s pretty rare in most other countries for customers to have to pay more for an item than what it says on the tag. Usually, the sales tax is taken into account when setting the price so the customer doesn\u2019t need to do the math just to make sure they can afford it. Intentionally or not, this conditions you to hate the idea of taxes even more than you already do. This policy is designed to make you feel the pain of paying taxes in a way you simply wouldn\u2019t if they just gave you the actual price upfront. It\u2019s one of the many things that provokes that instinctual repulsion against an increase of any kind of taxes, even if it\u2019s just relegated to the upper-income bracket.\n We have a media that conditions us to think of billionaires and CEOs as geniuses who have our best interests at heart. Mainstream outlets often assume that a person who is good at running a business also knows what\u2019s best for the economy as a whole. If the CEO of McDonald\u2019s says a minimum wage increase will be bad for the economy, there\u2019s very little question of whether there\u2019s a conflict of interest there. We assume that what\u2019s good for shareholders and what\u2019s good for the economy are the same thing.\n We have a society that\u2019s been taught to hate minimum-wage employees, even while we rely on them for so many of the services that run our lives. Think of the contempt in people\u2019s voices when they call a fast-food employee a burger flipper, the weird mocking tone in which they say the word janitor  in the context of the $15 an hour debate.\n We have a culture that encourages people to take pride in working unnaturally long hours. One of the most conservative people I\u2019ve ever met was a manager at my McDonald\u2019s who worked two jobs to support his family, totaling around 80 hours a week. He saw this as a sign of strength. He bragged about how little sleep he got and how many more hours he was working than the rest of us, never appearing to acknowledge the fact that it was insane and inhumane for him to have to do all this just to keep his family fed. In America, people take their systemic exploitation and spin it into a narrative about their personal endurance.\n We also have a government that does not raise the minimum wage gradually alongside inflation. The federal minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 for over 11 years now. The best move for the economy would\u2019ve been to increase this number gradually over the years, as many states like New York and Washington are already doing as well as countless other nations. If Congress moved it up just 50 cents a year, (which they  essentially did from 2007 to 2009), we\u2019d be at $12.50 right now without any major shocks to the system. $15 wouldn\u2019t seem so extreme.\n Instead, the federal government handles this issue in the most inefficient manner possible: by waiting until public pressure grows insurmountable. The minimum wage isn\u2019t set to automatically rise along with inflation, let alone with the cost of living. This is by design. The goal is to make a minimum wage increase as noticeable and difficult as possible. It makes every boost feel like a major deal even though the minimum wage is still far, far below what it would be if it had kept up with the cost of living since the \u201960s.\n The reality is that if the minimum wage had stayed consistent with productivity and inflation since 1968, America\u2019s lowest earners would be making around $24 an hour by now, an  analysis by  Jacobin found last year. Fifteen dollars is not asking for a lot. In fact, it\u2019s asking for less than the bare minimum of what we should be providing our workers.\n Because it\u2019s been so long since there\u2019s been a federal minimum wage increase, we\u2019re at the point where raising it gradually is too little too late. It would help slightly, of course, but not enough to meaningfully improve the lives of the millions of workers. For too many minimum wage workers, $15 is necessary now . They can\u2019t afford to wait another 10 years for it to slowly reach that point.\n This has put activists in a tough position because, although the effects will be an overall positive, the act of doubling the minimum wage in such a short period would undoubtedly be a major  change to our economy. There undoubtedly will be some unexpected side effects \u2014 good and bad \u2014 that would be easier to account for if the minimum wage had gone up gradually.\n When the economy doesn\u2019t collapse, when companies start to see the returns come in from the increased consumer spending, when millions of people are unburdened from the constant stress of working for as little as $7.25 an hour, people are going to realize that their understanding of the economy was based on lies the entire time.\n They\u2019ll see the reality that when CEOs say that something will cause them to lose money, what they mean is that it\u2019ll cause them to maybe not make as much. They\u2019ll see the reality that so much of our understanding of what\u2019s good for the economy is really based around what\u2019s good for shareholders, not what\u2019s good for the working class. When this is made clear, it will be easier for advocates to continue pushing for minimum wage increases going forward. Because let\u2019s face it: In reality, $15 an hour isn\u2019t nearly enough.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:11:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5c0f\u65f6,lucky,\u6700\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44", "title": "\u4f60\u662f\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u53ea\u9700\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f615\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "You\u2019re Lucky Workers Are Only Asking for $15 an Hour", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gen.medium.com/youre-lucky-they-re-only-asking-for-15-1ee2df51030", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5c0f\u65f6", "lucky", "\u6700\u4f4e\u5de5\u8d44"]}]
