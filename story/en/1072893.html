The team at the Department of Ophthalmology has used the approach to treat two more patients. A 51 year old man from the Allgäu region and a 39 year old woman from Middle Franconia both received the active ingredient BC 007 intravenously in an infusion lasting 75 minutes, and were then kept in the hospital for monitoring for a further three days. They have continued to attend outpatient appointments to monitor their health ever since. Both patients have already reported significant improvements in their performance and quality of life, and this has been corroborated in medical tests.</p><p>在2021年7月，埃朗根大学SksLikikm眼科宣布他们成功地治疗了一个长期的COVID患者（59岁）的全球突破，另外两名患者由于药物BC 007正在康复。眼科的研究小组已经用这种方法治疗了另外两名患者。一名来自Allgäu地区的51岁男子和一名来自中弗朗索尼亚的39岁女子都在持续75分钟的输液中接受了活性成分BC 007的静脉注射，然后在医院继续监测三天。从那以后，他们继续参加门诊预约，以监测自己的健康状况。这两名患者已经报告他们的表现和生活质量有了显著改善，医学测试也证实了这一点。</p><p> Following the pattern seen in the patient who was treated first, BC 007 also caused Long COVID symptoms in these patients to subside shortly after it was administered. ‘After someone contracts COVID-19, special autoantibodies start to circulate in their bloodstream. These then turn on the body itself and may damage certain structures within the body or affect circulation,’ explains ophthalmologist PD Dr. Dr. Bettina Hohberger. The drug BC 007 was developed several years ago, originally for patients with severe heart disease, but could now potentially be used in the fight against Long COVID. ‘In both patients currently being treated, we can see that BC 007 neutralises the harmful autoantibodies and retinal micro circulation, in other words blood flow in the smallest blood vessels in the eye, improves. We can prove that this is the case using optical coherence tomography angiography, or OCT-A for short. In addition, both patients experienced a reduction in their clinical Long COVID symptoms,’ confirmed Bettina Hohberger.</p><p>按照第一次接受治疗的患者的模式，BC 007也导致这些患者的长期新冠病毒症状在服用后不久消退在有人合同2019冠状病毒疾病后，特殊的自身抗体开始在血液中循环。眼科医生贝蒂娜·霍伯格博士解释说：“然后，这些物质会对身体本身产生作用，可能会损害身体内的某些结构或影响血液循环。”。药物BC 007是几年前开发的，最初用于严重心脏病患者，但现在可能用于对抗长时间新冠病毒在目前正在接受治疗的两名患者中，我们可以看到BC 007中和了有害的自身抗体，视网膜微循环，换句话说，眼睛最小血管中的血液流动得到改善。我们可以用光学相干断层扫描血管造影（简称OCT-A）证明这种情况。Bettina Hohberger证实，此外，两名患者的临床长期新冠肺炎症状都有所减轻。</p><p> ‘I was a shadow of my former self, a zombie. I barely recognised myself’</p><p>“我是我从前的影子，一个僵尸。我几乎认不出自己是谁</p><p> The second patient to receive the drug against Long COVID was Oliver G. (51) from the Allgäu region in Germany. He was knocked off his feet after contracting Covid in May 2020. Until then, Oliver G. had been a successful, internationally active key account manager, a keen cross-country skier who led a healthy lifestyle and had even taken part in several iron man competitions. After contracting Covid-19 he suddenly started to suffer from severe fatigue, problems with his balance, coordination and memory, twitching muscles and a pronounced tremor in his right hand and arm. ‘I was shaking so much it started to affect my leg. At one point, I thought I had Parkinson’s,’ he explains. In May 2020 he had no other option but to step down from his challenging job in sales. ‘I was completely disoriented and unfocused, I was just trying my best to survive from one day to the next. I was a shadow of my former self, a zombie. I barely recognised myself.’ Like many others affected by Long COVID, Oliver G. suffered from brain fog He had to withdraw from a reintegration programme offered by his company to get him back into work after just three months. ‘I was no longer able to follow conversations, I couldn’t draft a presentation or carry out negotiations and my colleagues had to help me with everything. At home, tackling the smallest chores became a major challenge, and for a while I even needed a home help. Reading, pottering around in the garden or taking my dog for a walk was basically all I could cope with. My problems with balance meant that I couldn’t drive, cycle or go on my motorbike. As if that wasn’t enough, I was plagued by financial worries, panic attacks and what I call emotional incontinence. I was completely incapable of keeping my emotions in check.’ Oliver G. even found himself unable to exercise at all, although that had, until then, been his preferred way to unwind.</p><p>第二位接受抗长时间新冠病毒药物治疗的患者是来自德国Allgäu地区的Oliver G.（51）。他在2020年5月感染新冠病毒后被击倒。在此之前，奥利弗·G.一直是一位成功的、活跃于国际市场的大客户经理，一位热衷于越野滑雪的人，他过着健康的生活方式，甚至参加过几次铁人比赛。在合同2019冠状病毒疾病后，他突然开始严重疲劳，平衡、协调和记忆问题，抽搐肌肉和右手和手臂上明显的颤抖。我浑身发抖，腿开始发抖。“有一次，我以为自己得了帕金森氏症，”他解释道。2020年5月，他别无选择，只能辞去销售这一富有挑战性的工作我完全迷失了方向，注意力不集中，我只是尽最大努力从一天活到下一天。我是我从前的影子，一个僵尸。我几乎认不出自己来了。”和其他许多受长时间新冠病毒影响的人一样，奥利弗·G.患有脑雾，他不得不退出公司提供的重返社会计划，以便在仅仅三个月后重返工作岗位我不再能够跟踪对话，我无法起草演讲稿或进行谈判，我的同事们不得不帮助我做所有事情。在家里，处理最小的家务成为一项重大挑战，有一段时间我甚至需要一个家庭帮手。阅读、在花园里闲逛或带我的狗散步基本上都是我能应付的。我的平衡问题意味着我不能开车、骑自行车或骑摩托车。似乎这还不够，我被财务担忧、恐慌症和我所说的情绪失禁所困扰。我完全无法控制自己的情绪。”奥利弗·G.甚至发现自己根本无法锻炼，尽管在那之前，这一直是他最喜欢的放松方式。</p><p> In early July 2021 the 51 year old heard about the first successful attempt to treat Long COVID and got in touch with the Department of Ophthalmology at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen. At the end of July he received his first infusion of BC 007. His autoantibodies were neutralised and the OCT-A showed an improvement in his blood flow. The very day after receiving the medicine, his brain fog lifted and his muscles stopped twitching as much as before. On day two his tremor disappeared. Over the course of the first week, his balance, fatigue, coordination and memory all improved. ‘My physical, cognitive and mental abilities have all returned. I have stopped lounging around incapable of doing anything else, I can think clearly again, I am emotionally stable and able to feel happy again,’ he explains. He is also looking forward to going back to work in his old position, after an enforced break of 15 long months. ‘I am grateful that my employer did not give up on me, and supported me every step of the way.’</p><p>2021年7月初，这位51岁的老人听说了第一次成功治疗长科维德，并与埃朗根州立大学的眼科取得联系。7月底，他第一次接受了BC 007的注射。他的自身抗体被中和，OCT-A显示他的血液流动有所改善。服药后的第二天，他的大脑雾消失了，肌肉也像以前一样停止了抽搐。第二天，他的震颤消失了。在第一周的过程中，他的平衡、疲劳、协调和记忆力都有所改善我的身体、认知和心理能力都恢复了。他解释说：“我已经不再无所事事，我可以重新清晰地思考，我的情绪稳定，能够再次感到快乐。”。在被迫休息了15个月之后，他还期待着回到原来的岗位上工作我很感激我的雇主没有放弃我，并支持我前进的每一步。”</p><p>   Patient no. 3 is a 39 year old primary school teacher from Middle Franconia. After contracting COVID-19, she also suffered from severe fatigue, brain fog, problems with balance, coordination, memory and concentration, as well as experiencing difficulties walking and changes to her sense of taste. At times she was temporarily paralysed in one of her hands and one of her feet. ‘This patient was the most severely affected by Long COVID that I have seen so far,’ reports Bettina Hohberger. She was no longer able to work and she was extremely unsteady on her feet. It was very difficult for her to follow conversations, and she kept falling asleep,’ reports the doctor. The patient herself explains, ‘I was a fit and healthy person before contracting Covid. I would go jogging three times a week, and absolutely loved cycling. My life was turned on its head when I came down with Covid. Most of the time I was confined to bed and didn’t even feel up to reading. ‘Just visiting the doctor, having a brief chat with colleagues or going for a short walk was enough to leave me paralysed for several hours. On the worst days, I was even unable to speak, although my thoughts were clear and I knew what I wanted to say. I would never have coped without my husband, my parents and the help of our friends,’ she continues.</p><p>3号患者是一名39岁的小学教师，来自佛朗哥中学。C2019冠状病毒疾病后，她也出现了严重的疲劳、脑雾、平衡、协调、记忆和集中等问题，并且行走困难，味觉也发生了变化。有时她的一只手和一只脚会暂时瘫痪。”贝蒂娜·霍伯格（Bettina Hohberger）报告说，这名患者是迄今为止我所见过的长时间新冠病毒感染最严重的患者。她再也不能工作了，脚也非常不稳。医生说，她很难跟上对话，而且一直在睡觉。病人自己解释说，“在感染新冠病毒之前，我是一个健康的人。我会一周慢跑三次，而且非常喜欢骑自行车。当我感染新冠病毒时，我的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。大多数时候，我都被困在床上，甚至觉得自己无法阅读仅仅是去看医生，和同事聊一聊，或者散散步就足以让我瘫痪几个小时。在最糟糕的日子里，我甚至不能说话，尽管我的思想很清晰，我知道我想说什么。她继续说，如果没有丈夫、父母和朋友的帮助，我永远都无法应对。</p><p> The 39 year old was also given BC 007 at the Department of Ophthalmology in Erlangen. ‘Her brain fog cleared significantly on day one after receiving the medicine,’ reports Bettina Hohberger. ‘Since then, her neurological symptoms and her fatigue have improved significantly.’ Once again, it is apparent that the active ingredient has successfully intervened into the patient’s molecular pathomechanism. The autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors were neutralised and clinical tests indicated an improvement in the flow of blood to the eye. ‘I have noticed steady improvements in my neurological symptoms. I have not experienced any paralysis since the infusion. Slowly but surely, I’m regaining confidence in my body. If I try to run or play with my children I do notice that my body becomes exhausted much quicker than before, but I recover after taking a rest. That was simply impossible before getting the medicine,’ reports the patient. 10 days after her treatment, the 39 year old had the following to say: ‘I’m so happy with the progress I’m making, and I’m thrilled that I can start to be there for my children again. Day by day I’m inching closer to my greatest dream: living an independent life, being there for my children and finally, at some point, for the pupils in my class. I am proud of the research being conducted here in Erlangen and eternally grateful for the excellent work being done and the care and attention I received. I sincerely hope that the medicine will be able to help many more Long COVID patients in the near future.’</p><p>这位39岁的老人还在埃尔兰根眼科接受了BC 007贝蒂娜·霍伯格报告说，在服用药物后的第一天，她的脑雾明显消失从那以后，她的神经症状和疲劳都有了显著改善很明显，活性成分再次成功地干预了患者的分子病理机制。抗G蛋白偶联受体的自身抗体被中和，临床试验表明流向眼睛的血液流量有所改善。”我注意到我的神经症状稳步改善。自从输液以来，我没有经历过任何瘫痪。慢慢地但肯定地，我正在恢复对自己身体的信心。如果我试着和我的孩子们一起跑步或玩耍，我确实注意到我的身体比以前快得多，但我在休息后恢复了。这位患者报告说，在拿到药之前，这根本是不可能的。在接受治疗10天后，这位39岁的女孩说：“我对自己取得的进步感到非常高兴，我很高兴我能再次回到孩子们身边。一天又一天，我离我最大的梦想越来越近：过独立的生活，在那里陪伴我的孩子，最终，在某个时刻，陪伴我班上的学生。我为在埃尔兰根进行的研究感到自豪，并永远感谢所做的出色工作以及我得到的关心和关注。我真诚地希望，在不久的将来，这种药物能够帮助更多的长期新冠病毒感染患者。”</p><p> Patient number one, a 59 year old banker from the Coburg district, is still feeling well three months after first receiving treatment at Universitätsklinikum Erlangen. He is not displaying any Long COVID specific symptoms, feels in good health and is living an active lifestyle.</p><p>一号患者是科伯格区的一名59岁银行家，在第一次在Universitätsklinikum Erlangen接受治疗三个月后仍感觉良好。他没有表现出任何长时间的新冠病毒特异性症状，身体状况良好，生活方式活跃。</p><p>  Prof. Dr. Christian Mardin, assistant chief physician at the Department of Ophthalmology stresses that although a fourth patient has recently been treated with BC 007, there are no plans to attempt to treat any other Long COVID patients with BC 007 at the current time. ‘We have filed an application for funding with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and hope that it will be approved. If so, then we could perhaps start clinical studies this year.’ Until then, people with Long COVID symptoms are welcome to send an e-mail to  recover.au@uk-erlangen.de. If they are suitable candidate, they will be contacted if and when clinical studies start.</p><p>眼科副主任医师克里斯蒂安·马丁教授强调，尽管第四名患者最近接受了BC 007治疗，但目前没有计划尝试治疗任何其他患有BC 007的长期新冠病毒患者。”我们已经向联邦教育和研究部提交了一份资金申请，希望能获得批准。如果是这样的话，我们或许可以在今年开始临床研究在那之前，有长期新冠病毒症状的人欢迎发送电子邮件进行康复。au@uk-埃尔兰根。de.如果他们是合适的候选人，将在临床研究开始时联系他们。</p><p>  Doctors at the Department of Ophthalmology as well as the Department of Medicine 1– Gastroenterology, Pneumology and Endocrinology and the Department of Medicine 3 – Rheumatology and Immunology had already discovered during the ReCOVer study that patients who have recovered from Covid-19 still have significantly limited blood flow to the eyes even if several months have passed since the infection. The researchers presumed that the changes to the blood flow affected the whole body, not just the eye. ‘It appears as if the drug BC 007 improves blood flow, leading to a reduction in Long COVID symptoms. We plan to investigate the various processes involved in more depth in future,’ PD Dr. Dr. Hohberger explains.</p><p>眼科和医学部1–胃肠病学的医生，在2019冠状病毒疾病恢复研究中已经发现，从COVID-19恢复过来的患者，即使在感染后几个月内血液流动也明显受限，也已经发现了风气和内分泌学和医学部3。研究人员推测，血液流动的变化影响了整个身体，而不仅仅是眼睛药物BC 007似乎可以改善血液流动，从而减少长期新冠病毒症状。霍伯格博士解释说，我们计划在未来更深入地研究涉及的各种过程。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/病毒/">#病毒</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/新冠病毒/">#新冠病毒</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/长时间/">#长时间</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/患者/">#患者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
