Draped head to toe in bug repellent gear, we stayed just ahead of the clouds of mosquitoes as we sidestepped roots, vines and giant ants. My local research assistant Dino Nate, my partner Kelly Rosinger and I were following Julio, one of my Tsimane&#39; friends and our guide on this day. Tsimane&#39; are a group of forager-horticulturalists who live in this hot, humid region. Just behind us, Julio&#39;s three-year-old son floated happily through the jungle, unfazed by the heat and insects despite his lack of protective clothing, putting my perspiration-soaked efforts to shame.</p><p>我们穿过玻利维亚亚马逊跋涉，在汗水中浸透。在臭虫驱蚊器中覆盖到脚趾，我们留在蚊子云之后，因为我们躲避根，葡萄藤和巨型蚂蚁。我的当地研究助理迪诺Nate，我的伴侣Kelly Rosinger和我在朱中，我的Tsimane之一＆＃39;朋友和我们的指南这一天。 Tsimane＆＃39;是一群居住在这个热潮的地区的艺术家园艺主义者。刚刚落后于我们，朱廖赛＆＃39;三岁的儿子幸福地穿过丛林漂浮，尽管他缺乏防护服，但将我的流汗浸泡羞辱。</p><p>  We stopped in front of what looked like a small tree but turned out to be a large vine. Julio told us Tsimane&#39; use it when they are in the old-growth forest and need water. He began whacking at the vine from all sides with his machete, sending chips of bark flying with each stroke. Within two minutes he had cut off a meter-long section. Water started to pour out of it. He held it over his mouth, drinking from it for a few seconds to quench his thirst, then offered it to me. I put my water bottle under the vine and collected a cup. It tasted pretty good: light, a little chalky, almost carbonated.</p><p>  我们在看起来像一棵小树的东西前面，但结果是一个大葡萄。朱莉奥告诉我们Tsimane＆＃39;当他们在旧成长林中时使用它，需要水。他开始用他的砍刀从各方骑在藤蔓上，用每次中风送吠声的薯条。在两分钟内，他已经切断了一米长的部分。水开始倒出。他把它放在嘴边，从中喝了几秒钟来熄灭他的口渴，然后向我提供。我把我的水瓶放在藤上并收集了一个杯子。它味道很好：光，有点垩白，几乎是碳酸。</p><p>  As part of my field research, I was asking Julio and other Tsimane&#39; people how they obtain the drinking water they need in different places—in their homes, in the fields, on the river or in the forest. He told me only two types of vines are used for water; the rest don&#39;t work or make you sick. But when he pointed to those other vines, I could hardly tell a difference. The vines are a hidden source of water. Julio&#39;s observations raise a fundamental question of human adaptation: How did our evolutionary history shape the strategies we use to meet our water needs, particularly in environments without ready access to clean water?</p><p>  作为我的实地考察的一部分，我问朱利奥和其他十匠＆＃39;人们如何获得他们在不同地方所需的饮用水 - 在他们的家中，在河上或森林里。他告诉我只使用两种类型的葡萄藤;其余的唐＆＃39; t工作或让你生病。但是当他指着那些其他葡萄藤时，我几乎无法讲述一个差异。葡萄藤是一个隐藏的水源。 Julio＆＃39;观察提出了人类适应的根本问题：我们的进化历史如何塑造我们用于满足我们的水需求的策略，特别是在没有准备好进入清洁水的环境中？</p><p>  Here in the forest we were in a relatively water-rich environment, but as we moved away from streams, Julio still knew exactly where and how to get water. Humans are not alone in keeping close track of natural water sources—many animals make mental maps of their surroundings to remember where important resources are found, and some even alter their environments for water. But we are unique in taking much more extreme measures.</p><p>  在森林里，我们在一个富含水的环境中，但随着我们从溪流移开时，Julio仍然究竟知道在哪里以及如何获得水。人类并不孤单地保持自然水源的密切轨道 - 许多动物制造周围环境的心理地图，以记住发现重要资源的地方，甚至改变了他们的水的环境。但我们采取更极端的措施是独一无二的。</p><p>  Throughout history people have drastically engineered their environments to ensure access to water. Take the historic Roman city of Caesarea in modern-day Israel. Back when it was built, more than 2,000 years ago, the region did not have enough naturally occurring freshwater to sustain a city. Because of its geographic importance to their colonial rule, the Romans, through extractive slave labor, built a series of aqueducts to transport water from springs as far as 16 kilometers away. This arrangement provided up to 50,000 people with approximately 145 liters of water per capita a day.</p><p>  在整个历史上，人们彻底设计了他们的环境，以确保进入水。在现代以色列中乘坐历史悠久的罗马市凯撒利亚。回到建造时，2000多年前，该地区没有足够的自然淡水来维持一个城市。由于其对殖民统治的地理重要性，罗马人通过采掘奴隶劳动，建造了一系列渡槽，以将水从弹簧运输到远远超过16公里。这一安排每天提供大约50,000人，每年有大约145升的水。</p><p>  Today cities use vast distribution networks to provide potable water to people, which has led to remarkable improvements in public health. When we have plenty of water, we forget how critical it truly is. But when water is precious, it is all we think about. All it takes is news of a shutoff or contamination event for worries about water insecurity to take hold.</p><p>  今天城市使用广阔的分销网络为人们提供饮用水，这导致公共卫生的显着改善。当我们有足够的水时，我们会忘记真正的关键方式。但是当水很珍贵时，我们就是我们的想法。所有所需要的是闭塞或污染事件的消息，担心水不安全持有的担忧。</p><p>  Without enough water, our physical and cognitive functions decline. Without any, we die within a matter of days. In this way, humans are more dependent on water than many other mammals are. Recent research has illuminated the origins of  our water needs—and how we adapted to quench that thirst. It turns out that much as food has shaped human evolution, so, too, has water.</p><p>  没有足够的水，我们的身体和认知功能下降。没有任何，我们在几天内死亡。通过这种方式，人类更依赖于许多其他哺乳动物的水。最近的研究已经照亮了我们的水需求的起源 - 以及我们如何调整渴望渴望。事实证明，随着食物形成人类演变，所以，也有水。 </p><p>      To understand how water has influenced the course of human evolution, we need to page back to a pivotal chapter of our prehistory. Between around three million and two million years ago, the climate in Africa, where hominins (members of the human family) first evolved, became drier. During this interval, the early hominin genus  Australopithecus gave way to our own genus,  Homo. In the course of this transition, body proportions changed: whereas australopithecines were short and stocky,  Homo had a taller, slimmer build with more surface area. These changes reduced our ancestors&#39; exposure to solar radiation while allowing for greater exposure to wind, which increased their ability to dissipate heat, making them more water-efficient.</p><p>要了解水域如何影响人类演变的过程，我们需要返回我们史前的关键章节。大约300万和200万年前，非洲的气候，其中的人（人类家庭的成员）首先演变，变得干燥。在这种间隔期间，早期的hominin属asseralopithecus赋予了我们自己的属，同性恋。在这种过渡过程中，身体比例发生了变化：而南澳大利亚曲霉矮小，同性恋者有更高的，更苗条的构建，具有更多的表面积。这些变化减少了我们的祖先＆＃39;暴露于太阳辐射，同时允许更大的风暴露，这增加了它们的散热能力，使得它们更加水分。</p><p>  Other key adaptations accompanied this shift in body plan. As climate change replaced forests with grasslands, and early hominins became more proficient at traveling on two legs in open environments, they lost their body hair and developed more sweat glands. These adaptations increased our ancestors&#39; ability to unload excess heat and thus maintain a safe body temperature while moving, as work by Nina Jablonski of Pennsylvania State University and Peter Wheeler of Liverpool John Moores University in England has shown.</p><p>  其他关键适应伴随着身体计划的转变。随着气候变化的替代草原的森林，早期的Hominins在开放环境中的两条腿上变得更加精通，他们丢失了身体毛发并开发了更多的汗腺。这些适应增加了我们的祖先＆＃39;能够卸下多余的热量，从而保持安全的体温在移动时，宾夕法尼亚州立大学的尼娜·纳布尼亚州立大学的工作和Liverpool John Moores University的Peter Wheeler展示了。</p><p>  Sweat glands are a crucial part of our story. Mammals have three types of sweat glands: apocrine, sebaceous and eccrine. The eccrine glands mobilize the water and electrolytes inside cells to produce sweat. Humans have more eccrine sweat glands than any other primate. A recent study by Daniel Aldea of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues found that repeated mutations of a gene called  Engrailed 1 may have led to this abundance of eccrine sweat glands. In relatively dry environments akin to the ones early hominins evolved in, the evaporation of sweat cools the skin and blood vessels, which, in turn, cools the body&#39;s core.</p><p>  汗腺是我们故事的关键部分。哺乳动物有三种类型的汗腺：口腔，皮脂腺和经过者。经过酸胆碱腺体在细胞内部动力和电解质产生汗液。人类比任何其他灵长类动物都有更多的经常汗腺。最近的宾夕法尼亚大学丹尼尔阿尔德省的一项研究发现，他的同事发现称为诱惑1的基因的重复突变可能导致了这种丰富的经过者的汗腺腺体。在相对干燥的环境中类似于早期的母素进化的环境中，汗液的蒸发冷却皮肤和血管，这反过来又冷却了身体＆＃39;核心。</p><p>  Armed with this powerful cooling system, early humans could afford to be more active than other primates. In fact, some researchers think that persistence hunting—running an animal down until it overheats—may have been an important foraging strategy for our ancestors, one they could not have pursued if they did not have a means to avoid overheating.</p><p>  用这种强大的冷却系统武装，早期人类可能比其他灵长类更活跃。事实上，一些研究人员认为，持久性狩猎奔跑，直到它过热 - 可能是我们祖先的重要觅食策略，如果他们没有避免过热的手段，他们就无法追求。</p><p>  This enhanced sweating ability has a downside, however: it elevates our risk of dehydration. Martin Hora of Charles University in Prague and his collaborators recently demonstrated that  Homo erectus would have been able to persistence hunt for approximately five hours in the hot savanna before losing 10 percent of its body mass. In humans, 10 percent body mass loss from dehydration is generally the cutoff before serious risk of physiological and cognitive problems or even death occurs. Beyond that point, drinking becomes difficult, and intravenous fluids are needed for rehydration.</p><p>  然而，这种增强的出汗能力有一个缺点：它提高了我们脱水的风险。查尔斯大学马丁霍拉在布拉格和他的合作者最近展示了Homo Erectus在失去其体重的10％之前，Homo Erectus将能够持久地捕杀大约五个小时。在人类中，10％的体重缺水通常是生理和认知问题甚至死亡的严重风险之前的截止。除此之外，饮酒变得困难，静脉内流体需要补液。</p><p>  Our vulnerability to dehydration means that we are more reliant on external sources of water than our primate cousins and far more than desert-adapted animals such as sheep, camels and goats, which can lose 20 to 40 percent of their body water without risking death. These animals have an extra compartment in the gut called the forestomach that can store water as an internal buffer against dehydration.</p><p>  我们对脱水的脆弱性意味着我们更依赖于外部水源，而不是我们的灵长类动物堂兄弟，远远超过沙漠适应的动物，如绵羊，骆驼和山羊，这可能会损失20％至40％的身体水，而不会冒着死亡。这些动物在肠道中有一个额外的隔间，称为林苗，可以将水作为内部缓冲液储存在脱水中。</p><p>  In fact, desert-dwelling mammals have a range of adaptations to water scarcity. Some of these traits have to do with the functioning of the kidneys, which maintain the body&#39;s water and salt balance. Mammals vary in the size and shape of their kidneys and thus the extent to which they can concentrate urine and thereby conserve body water. The desert pocket mouse, for example, can live without water for months, in part because of the extreme extent to which its kidneys can concentrate urine. Humans can do this to a degree. When we lose copious amounts of water from sweating, a complex network of hormones and neural circuitry directs our kidneys to conserve water by concentrating urine. But our limited ability to do so means we cannot go without freshwater for nearly so long as the pocket mouse.</p><p>  事实上，沙漠居住的哺乳动物具有一系列适应水资源稀缺性。其中一些特征与肾脏的功能有关，其维持身体＆＃39; s水和盐平衡。哺乳动物在肾脏的尺寸和形状中变化，因此它们可以集中尿液的程度，从而保护身体水。例如，沙漠口袋老鼠可以在没有水的情况下生活数月，部分原因是其肾脏可以集中尿液的极端程度。人类可以在一定程度上做到这一点。当我们减掉大量的水出汗时，复杂的激素和神经电路网络指示我们的肾脏通过浓缩尿液来保护水。但是我们有限的能力，这意味着我们不能在没有淡水的情况下尽可能长的淡水。 </p><p>  Neither can we preload our bodies with water. The desert camel can drink and store enough water to draw on for weeks. But if humans drink too much fluid, our urine output quickly increases. Our gut size and the rate at which our stomach empties limit how fast we can rehydrate. Worse, if we drink too much water too fast, we can throw off our electrolyte balance and develop hyponatremia—abnormally low levels of sodium in the blood—which is just as deadly if not more so than dehydration.</p><p>我们也不能用水预先加载我们的身体。沙漠骆驼可以喝酒并储存足够的水以绘制周数。但如果人类喝太多的液体，我们的尿液产量很快就会增加。我们的肠道尺寸和我们胃排空的速度限制了我们可以补充水分的速度。更糟糕的是，如果我们喝太多的水太快，我们可以脱离我们的电解质平衡，并且在血液中发育低钠血症 - 异常低水平的钠 - 这与脱水一样致命，这比脱水更多。</p><p>  Even under favorable conditions, with food and water readily available, people generally do not recover all of their water losses from heavy exercise for at least 24 hours. And so we must be careful to strike a balance in how we lose and replenish the water in our bodies.</p><p>  即使在有利的条件下，随着食品和水容易获得，人们通常不会从繁重的运动中恢复至少24小时的所有水损失。因此，我们必须小心地在我们的失去和补充我们身体中的水中的平衡。</p><p>      There was a reason I was asking Julio about “hidden” sources of water, such as vines, that Tsimane&#39; consumed. One evening after dinner a few weeks into my first bout of fieldwork in Bolivia in 2009, the combination of thirst and hunger led me to devour a large papaya. The juices ran down my chin as I ate the ripe fruit. I didn&#39;t think much of it at the moment, but soon after I got into my mosquito net for the night, my error revealed itself.</p><p>      有一个原因我要求朱里里奥关于“隐藏”的水源，如葡萄藤，那伊司＆＃39;消耗。晚上在2009年玻利维亚的第一个野外工作后的一天晚上，渴望和饥饿的结合让我吞噬了一个大木瓜。当我吃成熟的水果时，果汁跑下来。我没有在此刻思考它的大部分时间，但在我进入我的蚊帐之后，我的蚊帐很快，我的错误就会透露。</p><p>  In the Bolivian Amazon, the humidity reaches up to 100 percent at night. Every evening before going to bed I stripped down to my boxers, then rolled my clothes up tightly and put them into large resealable plastic bags so they wouldn&#39;t be soaked the next morning. After about an hour of lying in my mosquito net praying for a gust of wind to cool me off, a dreaded sensation set in: I needed to urinate. Knowing the amount of work it would take to get dressed, relieve myself, and then refold and stow my clothes, I cursed my decision to eat the papaya. And I had to repeat the process again later that night. I started thinking about how much water was in that fruit—the equivalent of three cups, it turns out. No wonder I had to pee.</p><p>  在玻利维亚亚马逊，湿度在晚上达到100％。每天晚上要睡觉前我剥去了我的拳击​​手，然后紧紧地把衣服卷起来，把它们放入大型可重复密封的塑料袋，所以他们不会在第二天早上浸透。大约一个小时躺在我的蚊帐中祈祷一阵风来冷却我，一个可怕的感觉套装：我需要小便。了解穿衣服的工作量，减轻我自己，然后重申并装下衣服，我诅咒我的决定吃木瓜。那天晚上我必须再次重复这个过程。我开始思考水果的水有多少钱 - 这是三个杯子的水果。难怪我不得不撒尿。</p><p>  Our dietary flexibility is perhaps our best defense against dehydration. As I learned the hard way on that sweltering night, the amount of water present in food contributes to total water intake. In the U.S., around 20 percent of the water people ingest comes from food, yet  my work among Tsimane&#39; found that foods, including fruits, contribute up to 50 percent of their total water intake. Adults in Japan, who typically drink less water than adults in the U.S., also get around half their water from the foods they eat. Other populations employ different dietary strategies to meet their water needs. Daasanach pastoralists in northern Kenya consume a great deal of milk, which is 87 percent water. They also chew on water-laden roots.</p><p>  我们的饮食灵活性可能是我们最好的防御脱水。当我学到了那个闷热的夜晚的艰难方式时，食物中存在的水量有助于总进水。在美国，大约20％的水中摄取来自食物，但我的工作在Tsimane＆＃39之间;发现食物，包括果实，占他们的总进水量的50％。日本的成年人通常比美国的成年人少喝水，也从他们吃的食物中达到了一半的水。其他人口采用不同的饮食策略来满足他们的水需求。肯尼亚北部的Daasanach牧民消耗大量的牛奶，这是87％的水。他们也咀嚼了浇筑的根源。</p><p>  Chimpanzees, our closest living primate relatives, also exhibit dietary and behavioral adaptations to obtaining water. They lick wet rocks and use leaves as sponges to collect water. Primatologist Jill Pruetz of Texas State University has found that in very hot environments, such as the savannas at Fongoli in Senegal, chimps seek shelter in cool caves and forage at night rather than during the day to minimize heat stress and conserve body water. But overall nonhuman primates get most of their water from fruits, leaves and other foods.</p><p>  黑猩猩，我们最近的生活热情亲属，也表现出饮食和行为适应来获得水。他们舔湿岩，用叶子作为海绵收集水。德克萨斯州立大学的原始学家吉尔普鲁斯发现，在塞内加尔的Fongoli的大草原等炎热环境中，在夜间的凉爽洞穴和牧草中寻找住所而不是在当天的时间，以尽量减少热量应激并保护身体水。但总体非人的灵长类动物从水果，叶子和其他食物中获得大部分水。</p><p>    Humans have evolved to use less water than chimps and other apes, despite our greater sweating ability, as new research by Herman Pontzer of Duke University and his colleagues has shown. Yet our greater reliance on plain water as opposed to water from food means that we must work hard to stay hydrated. Exactly how much water is healthy differs between populations and even from person to person, however. Currently there are two different recommendations for water intake, which includes water from food. The first, from the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, recommends 3.7 liters of water a day for men and 2.7 liters for women, while advising pregnant and lactating women to increase their intake by 300 and 700 milliliters, respectively. The second, from the European Food Safety Authority, recommends 2.5 and 2.0 liters a day for men and women, respectively, with the same increases for pregnant and lactating women. Men need more water than women do because their bodies are larger and have more muscle on average.</p><p>    尽管我们更大的出汗能力，人类已经进化使用了比黑猩猩和其他猿类更少的水，因为Duke大学的赫尔曼·佩尔亭的新研究和他的同事们已经表现出来。然而，我们对普通水的更大依赖，而不是来自食物的水意味着我们必须努力保持水分。然而，究竟有多少水与人群之间的水平有多少甚至是人。目前有两种不同的水摄入建议，其中包括来自食物的水。首先，来自美国国家医学院，为男性和2.7升为期一天为妇女推荐3.7升水，同时孕妇和哺乳期妇女分别增加300和700毫升的摄入量。第二，来自欧洲食品安全机构，分别为男女同时建议2.5和2.0升，对孕妇和哺乳期妇女同样增加。男人需要比女性更多的水，因为他们的身体较大，平均有更多的肌肉。 </p><p>  These are not hard-and-fast recommendations. They were calculated from population averages based on surveys and studies of people in specific regions. They are intended to fulfill the majority of water needs for moderately active, healthy people living in temperate and often climate-controlled environments. Some people may need more or less water depending on factors that include life habits, climate, activity level and age.</p><p>这些不是艰难的建议。根据特定地区人口的调查和研究，他们是根据人口平均值计算的。他们旨在满足居住在温带温带和往往气候控制环境的中度活跃，健康的人的大部分水需求。有些人可能需要或多或少的水，这取决于包括生命习惯，气候，活动水平和年龄的因素。</p><p>  In fact, water intake varies widely even in relatively water-secure locations such as the U.S. Most men consume between 1.2 and 6.3 liters on a given day and women between 1.0 and 5.1 liters. Throughout human evolution our ancestors&#39; water intake probably also varied substantially based on activity level, temperature, and exposure to wind and solar radiation, along with body size and water availability.</p><p>  事实上，即使在比例的位置，诸如美国大多数男性在给定的一天和5.1升之间的女性之间消耗1.2和6.3升的相对水处理的位置，水摄入量也很大。整个人类演变我们的祖先＆＃39;水摄入量可能基本上基于活动水平，温度和风力和太阳辐射，以及体尺寸和水可用性而变化。</p><p>  Yet it is also the case that two people of similar age and physical condition living in the same environment can consume drastically different amounts of water and both be healthy, at least in the short term. Such variation may relate to early life experiences. Humans undergo a sensitive period during fetal development that influences many physiological functions, among them how our bodies balance water. We receive cues about our nutritional environment while in the womb and during nursing. This information may shape the offspring&#39;s water needs.</p><p>  然而，也是如此，两个人的生活中的两个人和生活在同一环境中的身体状况可能会消耗大量不同的水，两者都是健康的，至少在短期内。这种变异可能与早期生活经历有关。人类在胎儿发育期间经历敏感时期，这些功能会影响许多生理功能，其中我们的身体如何平衡水。我们在子宫内和护理期间收到有关我们营养环境的提示。这些信息可以塑造后代和＃39; S的水需求。</p><p>  Experimental studies have demonstrated that water restriction among pregnant rats and sheep leads to critical changes in how their offspring detect bodily dehydration. Offspring born to such water-deprived mothers will be more dehydrated (that is, their urine and blood will be more concentrated) than offspring born to nondeprived mothers before they become thirsty and seek out water. These findings indicate that the dehydration-sensitivity set point is established in the womb.</p><p>  实验研究表明，怀孕大鼠和绵羊的水限制导致其后代如何检测身体脱水的关键变化。出生于这种防水母亲的后代将更脱水（即，他们的尿液和血液将更加集中），而不是在他们变得口渴并寻求水之前出生于非生命的母亲。这些发现表明，在子宫内建立了脱水敏感设定点。</p><p>  Thus, the hydration cues received during development may determine when people perceive thirst, as well as how much water they drink later in life. In a sense, these early experiences prepare offspring for the amount of water present in their environment. If a pregnant woman is dealing with a water-scarce environment and is chronically dehydrated, it may lead to her child consistently drinking less water later in life—a trait that is adaptive in places where water is hard to come by. Much more work is needed to test this theory, however.</p><p>  因此，在开发过程中收到的水合提示可以确定人们何时感知渴望，以及他们在生活中喝多少水。从某种意义上说，这些早期的经历为其环境中存在的水量准备后代。如果孕妇正在处理水资源稀缺的环境并且长期脱水，它可能会导致她的孩子始终在生活中持续饮用的水 - 一个适应水在难以来的地方的特质。然而，需要更多的工作来测试这个理论。</p><p>    Although early life experiences may determine how much water we drink without our being aware of it, locating safe sources of water is something we actively learn to do. In contrast to my accidental discovery of the hydrating effects of the papaya, Tsimane&#39; deliberately seek out water-rich foods. In an environment without clean water, eating instead of drinking more water may protect against exposures to pathogens. Indeed, my study found that those Tsimane&#39; who consumed more of their water from foods and fruit, such as papayas, were less likely to experience diarrhea.</p><p>    虽然早期的生活经历可能会确定我们喝的水有多少钱，但没有我们意识到它，找到安全的水源是我们积极学会的东西。与我意外发现番木瓜，十匠＆＃39的水合效果相比;故意寻求富含水的食物。在没有清洁水的环境中，吃更多的水可以防止暴露给病原体。的确，我的研究发现，那些十匠＆＃39;谁从食物和水果中消耗了更多的水，例如木瓜，不太可能经历腹泻。</p><p>  Many societies have developed dietary traditions that incorporate low-alcohol, fermented beverages, which can be essential sources of hydration because fermentation kills bacteria. (Beverages containing higher percentages of alcohol, on the other hand, increase urine production and thereby deplete the body&#39;s water stores.) Like other Amazonian populations, Tsimane&#39; drink a fermented beverage called chicha that is made from yuca or cassava. For Tsimane&#39; men, consuming fermented chicha was associated with lower odds of becoming dehydrated.</p><p>  许多社会制定了饮食传统，该传统掺入低酒精发酵饮料，这可能是必不可少的水合来源，因为发酵杀死细菌。 （另一方面，含有较高百分比酒精百分比的饮料，增加尿造产生，从而耗尽了身体＆＃39; s水上商店。）像其他亚马逊人口，十匠＆＃39;喝一个名为Chicha的发酵饮料，由Yuca或Cassava制成。尖沙＆＃39;消耗发酵的Chicha的男性与脱水的几率较低有关。 </p><p>  Getting enough water is one of humanity&#39;s oldest and most pressing challenges. Perhaps it is not surprising, then, that we map the locations of water sources in our minds, whether it is a highway rest stop, desert spring or jungle plant. As I watched Julio cut the vine down, his son was also watching, learning where this critical water source was. I glimpsed how this process plays out across generations.
