I had last visited at the end of March, when the city was rapidly emerging as the epicentre of America’s coronavirus outbreak. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s stay-at-home order was about to kick in, and I had come to write a story marking the moment: the city that never sleeps goes into a coma. What I saw shocked me.</p><p>在我险些死去的那一天，纽约正慢慢恢复生机。我上一次访问是在3月底，当时这座城市正迅速崛起，成为美国冠状病毒爆发的中心。纽约州州长安德鲁·科莫(Andrew Cuomo)的居家命令即将生效，我是来写一篇纪念这一时刻的故事：不夜城陷入昏迷。我所看到的让我震惊。</p><p> The thriving metropolis I had lived in for the previous two years – first as a postgraduate university student, then as United States correspondent for  The Sydney Morning Herald and  The Age – looked like a scene from  The Road, Cormac McCarthy’s post-apocalyptic novel. A fundamentalist Christian minister stood outside a shuttered Broadway theatre, preaching to a two-person congregation about how to avoid eternal damnation. A homeless man pleaded with a woman to throw him a dollar bill so he could eat and she could remain physically distant. Otherwise, the streets around Times Square were deserted. I felt relieved to hop on the train back to Washington D.C., where I had recently moved to cover this year’s presidential election.</p><p>前两年我住过的这个繁荣的大都市-先是作为一名研究生，然后是“悉尼先驱晨报”和“时代报”(The Age)的美国记者-看起来就像科马克·麦卡锡(Cormac McCarthy)的后世界末日小说“道路”(The Road)中的一个场景。一名信奉原教旨主义的基督教牧师站在一家关闭的百老汇剧院外，向两人会众宣讲如何避免永恒的诅咒。一名无家可归的男子恳求一名女子扔给他一美元钞票，这样他就可以吃东西了，而她也可以保持身体上的距离。除此之外，时代广场周围的街道空无一人。跳上返回华盛顿特区的火车，我感到松了一口气，我最近搬到那里报道今年的总统选举。</p><p> When I returned 10 weeks later, it was the middle of June. New York was starting to get back some of its old swagger. It was a balmy spring day: sun in the sky, a gentle breeze blowing off the Hudson River. At the peak of the pandemic in April, 800 people in New York state were dying each day from the virus; that number had dropped to about 30. You could almost feel the city exhaling in relief that its worst coronavirus days were behind it.</p><p>当我10周后回来的时候，已经是6月中旬了。纽约开始重拾往日的昂首阔步。那是一个温暖的春日：天空中的太阳，和煦的微风吹过哈德逊河。在4月份大流行的高峰期，纽约州每天有800人死于这种病毒；这个数字已经下降到大约30人。你几乎可以感觉到这座城市松了一口气，因为它最糟糕的冠状病毒时代已经过去。</p><p> I had travelled up for the 30th birthday party of my friend Peter, a shy and sensitive architect who grew up in Wisconsin. To celebrate, he had organised a “socially distanced picnic” in Central Park: everyone wearing masks, and sitting on their own blanket. Rather than sleep on a friend’s couch as I usually would when visiting New York, I’d booked a room for myself in a nice hotel. A treat, I thought, after a tiring few months.</p><p>我是去参加我的朋友彼得的30岁生日派对的，彼得是一位害羞而敏感的建筑师，在威斯康星州长大。为了庆祝，他在中央公园组织了一次“社交距离野餐”：每个人都戴着口罩，坐在自己的毯子上。我没有像往常去纽约时那样睡在朋友的沙发上，而是在一家不错的酒店为自己订了一个房间。在疲惫的几个月后，我想，这是一种款待。</p><p> As it turned out, I would never check into the hotel. Instead, I would spend the night in the trauma ward of a Manhattan hospital after falling off the rooftop of a five-storey apartment building. Not that I could ever have foreseen that as we sat chatting and laughing in Central Park, enjoying a day that felt blissfully close to normal life.</p><p>事实证明，我永远也不会入住这家酒店。相反，我会在曼哈顿一家医院的创伤病房过夜，因为我从一座五层公寓楼的屋顶上摔了下来。这并不是说，当我们坐在中央公园有说有笑，享受着感觉非常接近正常生活的幸福的一天时，我从来没有预见到这一点。</p><p> The picnic was the first group gathering I had experienced in three months. My working life since the pandemic began had been intense and invigorating. I’d travelled to one of the nation’s worst COVID-19 hotspots – the city of Albany, Georgia, in the country’s south – to report on  how the residents there were faring. Among those I spoke to was Elaine Williams, whose son Kenya, who had Down syndrome, had died after contracting the virus. She then tested positive, meaning she had to grieve for her son in isolation.</p><p>这次野餐是我三个月来第一次参加集体聚会。自从大流行开始以来，我的工作生活紧张而令人振奋。我去了全国最糟糕的新冠肺炎热点之一-该国南部的佐治亚州奥尔巴尼市-报道那里的居民过得怎么样。我采访过的人中有伊莱恩·威廉姆斯(Elaine Williams)，她的儿子肯尼亚患有唐氏综合症，在感染病毒后死亡。然后她的检测呈阳性，这意味着她不得不孤立地为她的儿子哀悼。</p><p> I’d reported from outside the White House as rioters set fire to cars and nearby office buildings in the days after George Floyd’s death. Then I watched as the protests swelled into huge, peaceful marches against racial injustice. But my social life had ground to a halt.</p><p>乔治·弗洛伊德死后的几天里，我在白宫外报道了暴徒放火焚烧汽车和附近办公楼的事件。然后，我眼睁睁地看着抗议活动扩大为反对种族不公正的大规模和平游行。但是我的社交生活陷入了停顿。</p><p>  Having only recently moved to Washington, I didn’t know many people there. Most of those I did know had fled to their hometowns when the pandemic began. Some days, the only social interaction I had was with the cleaners who came into our office building each afternoon – despite the fact almost everyone was working from home. Like me, they were ghosts from a pre- pandemic age, drifting through an unrecognisable world.</p><p>我最近才搬到华盛顿，在那里认识的人不多。我认识的大多数人在大流行开始时都逃回了家乡。有些日子里，我唯一的社交互动就是每天下午来到我们办公楼的清洁工--尽管事实上几乎每个人都在家工作。和我一样，他们是大流行前时代的幽灵，漂泊在一个面目全非的世界里。</p><p> As the sun began setting over Central Park, there were a handful of us left celebrating Peter’s birthday. We were keen to keep the party going, but bars and restaurants were closed in New York and indoor gatherings had become taboo. So we decided to go to the rooftop of Peter’s apartment in Hell’s Kitchen. Even in pre-pandemic times, this wouldn’t have been unusual. It’s common for space-deprived New Yorkers to use their apartment rooftops for socialising, exercising and even practising their musical instruments.</p><p>当太阳开始落下中央公园时，我们剩下几个人在庆祝彼得的生日。我们热衷于让聚会继续下去，但纽约的酒吧和餐馆都关门了，室内聚会已经成为禁忌。所以我们决定去地狱厨房彼得公寓的屋顶。即使在大流行前，这也不是什么不寻常的事情。对于空间匮乏的纽约人来说，利用他们的公寓屋顶进行社交、锻炼甚至练习乐器是很常见的。</p><p> When I arrived, after stopping by a bottle shop to pick up some wine, the others were already on the roof. Peter had laid out some rugs and candles in a corner to designate where we should sit. It was dark by now. I was tipsy, but not more so than a regular Saturday night.</p><p>当我到达时，在一家酒水店停下来买了一些酒后，其他人已经在屋顶上了。彼得在角落里摆放了一些地毯和蜡烛，指定我们应该坐的地方。现在天已经黑了。我喝醉了，但并不比普通的周六晚上更醉。</p><p>  I got up, intending to go downstairs to use the bathroom in Peter’s apartment. Having never been up there before, I thought I would take a quick look at the city skyline from the other side of the roof, fewer than 10 steps away. Most of the others were absorbed in conversation and looking in the other direction. One friend saw me walking across the roof but didn’t think anything of it.</p><p>我站起来，打算下楼去用彼得公寓的卫生间。我以前从未去过那里，我想我应该从屋顶的另一边快速看一眼城市的天际线，不到10步远。其他大多数人都在全神贯注地交谈，看着另一个方向。一位朋友看到我走过屋顶，但并没有把它放在心上。</p><p> I stepped out onto what I thought was concrete, but found there was nothing under my feet. Suddenly I was free-falling through the night sky, with my back parallel to the ground, like Don Draper in the opening credits of  Mad Men. Instead of walking across the roof, I had stepped into an air shaft: a narrow gap designed to allow light and ventilation into adjacent apartment buildings. Because it was so dark, I had no idea it was there.</p><p>我走上我认为是混凝土的地方，但发现我脚下什么也没有。突然，我在夜空中自由落体，背部与地面平行，就像“广告狂人”(Mad Men)片头字幕中的唐·德雷珀(Don Draper)。我没有穿过屋顶，而是走进了一个通风井：一个狭窄的缝隙，旨在让光线和通风进入邻近的公寓楼。因为太黑了，我不知道它在那里。</p><p> Fifth storey. Fourth storey. Third storey. Second storey. First storey. When you fall from such a height, you have enough time to realise what is happening to you. I knew I was falling fast, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I remember thinking that I was probably going to die, aged 32.</p><p>五楼。四楼。三楼。二楼。一楼。当你从这样的高度坠落时，你有足够的时间意识到发生在你身上的是什么。我知道我掉得很快，我无法阻止它。我记得当时我想我可能要死了，那年32岁。</p><p>  The next thing I knew I was in agonising pain. Waves of shock were surging through my body, making it hard to figure out exactly what was hurting the most. I was jammed into a corner, unable to move. There was a window and an airconditioning unit next me; I’d fallen right outside one of the ground-floor apartments. Underneath me were hard bricks but something else was also pressing into my back. I couldn’t tell exactly what.</p><p>接下来的一件事，我只知道我正处于极度痛苦之中。冲击波涌入我的身体，让我很难准确地找出什么是最痛的。我被挤在角落里，动弹不得。我旁边有一扇窗户和一台空调，我正好从一楼的一间公寓外面摔了下来。我下面是硬砖，但还有别的东西压进了我的背部。我说不清到底是什么。</p><p> As I stared up into the darkness, I saw my friends peering over the edge and could hear them yelling out my name. Peter was reassuring me that everything was going to be okay but I could hear his voice trembling with fear. Apparently I was groaning in pain and saying, “I’m scared.”</p><p>当我抬头凝视黑暗时，我看到我的朋友们从边上往外看，可以听到他们在喊我的名字。彼得向我保证一切都会好起来的，但我能听到他害怕得发抖的声音。很明显，我痛苦地呻吟着说，“我很害怕。”</p><p> And I was. I knew I was alive, which seemed incredible – even in the moment. But I was terrified of what I’d done to myself. I wondered if I’d ever be able to walk again. Within just six minutes, a team of paramedics arrived and hauled me onto a stretcher, carrying me out through the ground-floor apartment next to the air shaft.</p><p>我确实是。我知道我还活着，这似乎令人难以置信-即使是在那一刻。但我很害怕我对自己做的事。我想知道我是否还能走路。短短六分钟内，一队医护人员赶到，把我拖到担架上，抬着我穿过通风井旁边的一楼公寓。</p><p> After loading me into an ambulance, the paramedics used scissors to cut me out of the black denim overalls and T-shirt I was wearing. Left behind on the ground were my glasses and one of my shoes, which must have come off when I fell.</p><p>把我抬上救护车后，医护人员用剪刀剪掉了我当时穿的黑色牛仔裤和T恤。落在地上的是我的眼镜和一只鞋，肯定是我摔倒时掉下来的。</p><p> I remember the paramedics testing my memory – “What’s your name? What city are we in?” – and stretching out my limbs to locate where I was injured. From that point, things start getting hazy.</p><p>我记得医护人员在测试我的记忆力-“你叫什么名字？我们在哪个城市？“--然后伸出我的四肢寻找我受伤的地方。从那时起，事情就开始变得模糊不清了。</p><p>  Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, overlooking the East River, is the oldest public hospital in the United States. Opened in 1736, it is best known as a pioneering and notorious psychiatric facility: the “Chelsea Hotel of the mad”, in the words of  New York Magazine writer Mark Harris.</p><p>曼哈顿贝尔维尤医院俯瞰东河，是美国历史最悠久的公立医院。它于1736年开业，以一家开创性和臭名昭著的精神病院而闻名：用“纽约杂志”作家马克·哈里斯的话说，就是“疯狂的切尔西酒店”。</p><p> The writer Norman Mailer was sent there in 1960 after stabbing his wife. So was Mark David Chapman after shooting John Lennon outside the Dakota apartments in December 1980. Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was  treated for chest pains there after being sentenced to jail (the hospital has a dedicated ward for prisoners from New York’s famous Rikers Island jail).</p><p>作家诺曼·梅勒(Norman Mailer)在1960年刺伤妻子后被送往那里。1980年12月，马克·大卫·查普曼(Mark David Chapman)在达科他州公寓外枪杀约翰·列侬后也是如此。名誉扫地的好莱坞制片人哈维·温斯坦(Harvey Weinstein)在被判入狱后因胸痛在那里接受治疗(医院有一个专门的病房，收容来自纽约著名的莱克斯岛监狱的囚犯)。</p><p> And when I fell off Peter’s rooftop, four kilometres away, it is where I was taken for treatment. Specifically, I was admitted to Bellevue’s level-one trauma centre – reserved for patients in a critical condition who require the highest level of care.</p><p>当我从4公里外的彼得的屋顶上摔下来时，我就是在那里被送去接受治疗的。具体地说，我住进了贝尔维尤的一级创伤中心-为需要最高级别护理的危重患者预留的。</p><p> Through the fog of pain and shock, some memories stand out. I remember the jolt of excruciating pain as I was lifted from my hospital bed onto a stretcher to have a CT scan. The hospital bed sheets had stuck to the lacerated and red-raw skin on my back and needed to be ripped off. I felt like a human voodoo doll as nurses performed an array of blood tests and hooked me up to an IV. I remember being tested for COVID. “This could hurt,” a nurse warned. I remember thinking, with something verging on amusement, that pain from a nasal swab was the least of my worries at the time.</p><p>穿过痛苦和震惊的迷雾，一些记忆脱颖而出。我记得当我从病床上被抬到担架上做CT扫描时，剧烈的疼痛。医院的床单粘在了我背上撕裂的、红红的皮肤上，需要撕下。护士们给我做了一系列的血液测试，并给我打了静脉注射，我感觉自己就像是一个伏都教娃娃。我记得当时正在接受COVID检测。“这可能会很疼，”一名护士警告说。我记得当时我想，带着某种近乎娱乐的感觉，鼻拭子带来的疼痛是我最不担心的。</p><p> Out of view, I could hear the hospital staff gossiping about my fall and how I had managed to survive. I remember how dry my lips felt. I begged for a glass of water but the nurses were unable to give me any: my stomach needed to be completely empty in case I required urgent surgery. Adding to my sense of confusion, the hospital staff kept referring to me as Hadley. As I told them again and again that it wasn’t my name, I began to feel like a character in an absurdist play.</p><p>在我的视线之外，我可以听到医院的工作人员在闲聊我摔倒了，以及我是如何设法活下来的。我记得我的嘴唇有多干燥。我乞求一杯水，但护士们不能给我：我的胃需要完全清空，以防我需要紧急手术。更让我感到困惑的是，医院工作人员一直称我为哈德利。当我一次又一次地告诉他们那不是我的名字时，我开始觉得自己像一个荒诞派戏剧中的角色。</p><p>  The most pressing issue for the orthopaedic team was my left shoulder, which was visibly dislocated. Before attempting to reattach it, the doctor told me I would be given a dose of fentanyl: an opioid that is up to 100 times more potent than morphine. He went away, returned and started using a bed sheet to try to pop the shoulder back into the socket. Alarmed, I told him that I had not been given any pain medication. He didn’t believe me and kept using the bed sheet to try to yank my shoulder back into place. I was howling in pain as I underwent what felt like an excruciating form of medieval torture. When a nurse walked by, the doctor asked her how much fentanyl she had given me. She said she had not given it to me yet.</p><p>对于骨科团队来说，最紧迫的问题是我的左肩明显脱臼。在试图重新接上它之前，医生告诉我会给我一剂芬太尼：一种比吗啡效力高达100倍的阿片类药物。他离开了，回来了，开始用床单试着把肩膀放回插座里。我很惊慌，告诉他我没有服用任何止痛药。他不相信我，一直用床单试图把我的肩膀拉回原位。我痛苦地嚎叫着，因为我正在经历一种感觉像是中世纪折磨的折磨。当一位护士走过时，医生问她给我开了多少芬太尼。她说她还没有给我。</p><p>  Bit by bit, the doctors started relaying information about my injuries. The most serious damage was to my left elbow, which had shattered into many pieces. I had broken my left wrist. As well as the dislocated left shoulder, I had damaged my right shoulder. I also had a broken rib and acute fractures in seven vertebrae of my upper back.</p><p>渐渐地，医生们开始传递关于我受伤的信息。最严重的损伤是我的左肘，它被摔成了许多碎片。我的左腕骨折了。除了左肩脱臼，我的右肩也受伤了。我还有一根肋骨骨折，我的上背部有七个椎骨急性骨折。</p><p> These were, in the doctors’ words, “serious mechanical injuries”. I would need surgery for my broken elbow and wrist. But I knew it was remarkable what I hadn’t injured, given how far I had fallen. Everything below my hips was completely unaffected: my legs and feet were in perfect condition. I had not hit my head, and I never lost consciousness. I had not damaged any internal organs or suffered internal bleeding.</p><p>用医生的话说，这些都是“严重的机械损伤”。我的手肘和手腕骨折需要动手术。但我知道，考虑到我摔得有多深，我没有受伤的地方是了不起的。我的臀部以下的所有东西都完全没有受到影响：我的腿和脚都处于完美的状态。我没有撞到头，也没有失去知觉。我没有损伤任何内脏，也没有内出血。</p><p> In fact, it was remarkable I was alive at all. As a radiology assistant at the hospital told me while giving me an X-ray: “When we see people who have fallen five storeys, they usually don’t survive.”</p><p>事实上，我还活着是件了不起的事。正如医院的一位放射科助理在给我做X光检查时告诉我的那样：“当我们看到从五层楼掉下来的人时，他们通常不会活下来。”</p><p>  While all this was happening, Facebook Messenger calls were ricocheting between friends and family members on three continents. Because of the strict COVID restrictions in place at the time, visitors were not allowed into the hospital. The only thing my friends knew was that I had been conscious when I was carried into the ambulance.</p><p>在这一切发生的同时，Facebook Messenger的通话在三大洲的朋友和家人之间来回跳跃。由于当时COVID的严格限制，访客不允许进入医院。我的朋友们唯一知道的是，当我被抬上救护车时，我是清醒的。</p><p> They didn’t have any contact details for my family, so they called a mutual friend in Australia. He called another friend and they called another until they finally got through to my younger sister, who lives in London.</p><p>他们没有我家人的任何联系方式，所以他们给澳大利亚的一位共同的朋友打了电话。他给另一位朋友打了电话，他们又给另一位朋友打了电话，直到他们最终接通了我住在伦敦的妹妹。</p><p> My sister then called my parents, David and Marilyn, who were about to have dinner at their home in Newcastle. They tried calling the hospital but kept getting placed on hold. Adding to the difficulty was the fact – for reasons I would never figure out – that I had been entered into the hospital system as Hadley rather than my real name.</p><p>然后，我妹妹给我的父母大卫和玛丽莲打了电话，他们正要在纽卡斯尔的家中吃晚饭。他们试着给医院打电话，但一直被挂断。更困难的是，我是以哈德利(Hadley)的身份进入医院系统，而不是我的真名-这一事实-原因我永远不会弄清楚。</p><p>  As they waited for news, my sister googled what happens when you fall off an apartment building. What she found made her even more worried. There was a  New York Post story about a 27-year-old man who died after falling from a four-storey Manhattan apartment building. There was a story about a 22-year-old woman who died after falling from a four-storey clocktower. There was  a story eerily similar to mine: a university student who had fallen off a five-storey apartment building in Manhattan and was taken to Bellevue Hospital. She survived but broke her pelvis and had to learn to walk again.</p><p>在他们等待消息的时候，我妹妹在谷歌上搜索当你从公寓楼上摔下来时会发生什么。她的发现让她更加担心。“纽约邮报”曾报道过一名27岁的男子从曼哈顿一栋四层公寓楼坠落身亡。有一个故事是关于一名22岁的女子从四层楼高的钟楼上坠落后死亡的。有一个故事与我的故事惊人地相似：一名大学生从曼哈顿的一栋五层公寓楼上摔下来，被送往贝尔维尤医院(Bellevue Hospital)。她活了下来，但骨盆骨折了，不得不再次学习走路。</p><p> I didn’t have my phone with me when I fell, meaning I couldn’t contact anyone. As I lay alone in my hospital room, unable to move my upper body, the enormity of what had happened started to hit me. It was as if the IV machine beside me was pumping heightened emotions straight into my veins.</p><p>我摔倒的时候没有带手机，也就是说我联系不上任何人。当我独自躺在病房里，上半身无法移动时，所发生的巨大事情开始打击我。就好像我身边的静脉注射机正在把高涨的情绪直接注入我的血管。</p><p> Waves of relief surged through me, but also guilt. I felt terrible about ruining Peter’s birthday. I’m not religious but I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some kind of divine wake-up call, a form of punishment for all the ways I had fallen short as a human being. It seems to be part of human nature that when something momentous happens to us, we seek a deeper meaning in that event. In a bid to keep my heart rate down, I told myself not to project significance on what had happened. My fall was not a metaphor or a morality tale. It was neither reward nor punishment. It was an accident and no one was to blame.</p><p>一波又一波的解脱涌上我的心头，但也有负罪感。毁了彼得的生日，我感到很难过。我不信教，但我忍不住怀疑这是不是某种神圣的警钟，是对我作为一个人的所有不足之处的一种惩罚。这似乎是人性的一部分，当重大事件发生在我们身上时，我们会在事件中寻求更深层次的意义。为了保持较低的心率，我告诉自己不要对所发生的事情表现出重大意义。我的跌倒不是一个比喻，也不是一个道德故事。这既不是奖赏也不是惩罚。这是一场意外，没有人应该受到责备。</p><p> I couldn’t help but wonder if this was some kind of divine wake-up call, a form of punishment for all the ways I had fallen short as a human being.</p><p>我不禁怀疑，这是不是某种神圣的警钟，是对我作为一个人的所有不足之处的一种惩罚。</p><p> Then a bright blue landline phone next to my bed started to ring. Unable to reach for it, I called out for a nurse, who placed the receiver next to my ear. It was my dad. When I told him that I was okay, and explained the extent of my injuries, he was relieved. “Dad, my teeth are fine,” he remembers me saying, which he found amusing. For some reason, my intact teeth struck me as the ultimate evidence of how lucky I’d been. He was more interested in the fact I could move my feet. After they hung up, my parents opened a bottle of champagne.</p><p>然后，我床边的一部明亮的蓝色座机开始响起来。我伸手不到，就叫了护士，护士把听筒放在我的耳朵旁边。是我爸爸打来的。当我告诉他我没事，并解释我受伤的程度时，他松了一口气。“爸爸，我的牙齿很好，”他记得我说过这句话，他觉得很好笑。出于某种原因，我完好无损的牙齿给我留下了深刻的印象，这是我有多么幸运的终极证据。他更感兴趣的是我的脚可以动。挂断电话后，我父母开了一瓶香槟。</p><p> It was only the next day – when the doctors told me my wrist and elbow surgeries had been successful – that I felt truly able to celebrate. To come so close to death and survive is terrifying but also exhilarating. I can’t imagine any drug producing the sense of euphoria I felt as I lay in my hospital bed the day after surgery. The world seemed to vibrate with a new intensity. I joked with a nurse that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Hadley and tell her she was a miracle.</p><p>直到第二天，当医生告诉我，我的手腕和肘部手术成功时，我才真正感到能够庆祝。如此接近死亡并幸存下来是可怕的，但也是令人振奋的。我无法想象有哪种药物能产生手术后第二天躺在病床上时的那种欣快感。世界似乎以一种新的强度震动。我和一位护士开玩笑说，如果我有一个女儿，我会给她取名哈德利，告诉她她是个奇迹。</p><p> I began to cry. I still had sunscreen on my face from the day in the park and my eyes were stinging. A nurse walked by and, in an effort to comfort me, told me that things would be okay. I tried to explain that I was crying not because I was upset but because I was grateful to be alive. She picked up the corner of the bed sheet and wiped away my tears.</p><p>我开始哭起来。从公园那天起，我的脸上还涂着防晒霜，眼睛刺痛。一位护士走过，试图安慰我，告诉我一切都会好起来的。我试图解释说，我哭不是因为我难过，而是因为我很感激自己还活着。她捡起床单的一角，擦去我的眼泪。</p><p>  Back home, word was spreading about my accident: journalists, after all, love to gossip. I didn’t want  The Sydney Morning Herald and  The Age’s national editor, Tory Maguire, to have to keep fielding questions from concerned colleagues, so I sent out a few tweets explaining what had happened. Amid the many heartfelt replies, one follower sent me a link to a  2017 study titled:  Some Patients Live After Trauma: Re-examining the Lethality of Vertical Deceleration Injuries. A team of doctors at a hospital in the Bronx had examined the survival rates of patients who had fallen from significant heights. They found that half of the patients who fell from the height I did – 18.2 metres – had died, while the other half survived.</p><p>在国内，关于我的事故的消息正在传播：毕竟，记者们喜欢八卦。我不想让“悉尼先驱晨报”和“时代”的全国编辑托里·马奎尔(Tory Maguire)不得不不断回答忧心忡忡的同事的问题，所以我发了几条推文解释发生了什么。在众多发自内心的回复中，一位关注者给我发来了2017年一项研究的链接，题为：一些患者在创伤后生活：重新检查垂直减速损伤的致命性。布朗克斯一家医院的一组医生检查了从显著高处坠落的患者的存活率。他们发现，从18.2米的高空坠落的患者中，有一半已经死亡，而另一半活了下来。</p><p> I later emailed the lead author of the Bronx study, Michael Smith, and asked to speak to him about his findings. He replied almost instantly, saying no one had taken much interest in the study before. Smith said the crucial factor separating those who died and those who survived was how they landed. “If you hit your head, you’re dead,” he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>后来，我给布朗克斯研究的主要作者迈克尔·史密斯(Michael Smith)发了一封电子邮件，要求与他谈谈他的发现。他几乎立刻回答说，以前没有人对这项研究感兴趣。史密斯说，区分遇难者和幸存者的关键因素是他们如何着陆。“如果你撞到头，你就死定了，”他实事求是地说。</p><p> He asked me to describe how I had fallen, and my resulting injuries. “You were very lucky,” he said, and I could only agree.</p><p>他让我描述一下我是如何摔倒的，以及由此造成的伤害。“你非常幸运，”他说，我只能同意。</p><p>  In case I needed another reason to feel grateful, it came four days after my surgery, when another patient was admitted to my hospital room.</p><p>如果我需要另一个感恩的理由，那是在我手术四天后，另一个病人住进了我的病房。</p><p> Rafael (not his real name) had been shot four times – including in one of his testicles and his hand. Unsurprisingly, he was in extreme pain and in a foul mood. Rafael was homeless and had been living for some time in a shelter in Manhattan. He said he had been shot by a gang member after accidentally knocking over one of their bicycles, though I had no idea if that was true. Police officers came by with a series of photographs and asked him to identify the man who had shot him.</p><p>拉斐尔(化名)中了四枪，包括他的一个睾丸和他的手。不出所料，他极度痛苦，心情不好。拉斐尔无家可归，已经在曼哈顿的一个避难所生活了一段时间。他说他是在不小心撞倒了他们的一辆自行车后被帮派成员开枪打死的，尽管我不知道这是不是真的。警察带着一系列照片过来，要求他确认开枪打死他的人的身份。</p><p> Rafael was a volatile character. He could be charming one moment – chatting pleasantly with the nurses about where they went to high school – and aggressive the next. He had a particularly hostile reaction to the psychiatrists who dropped by to ask after his wellbeing. When a male nurse lingered too long near Rafael’s bed for his liking, he unleashed a torrent of homophobic slurs. A nurse was permanently stationed at our door to monitor him; I’m sure it was a form of suicide watch.</p><p>拉斐尔是个反复无常的人。他可能前一刻很迷人--与护士们愉快地谈论她们上过高中的事--但下一刻又会咄咄逼人。他对那些路过询问他的健康的精神病学家有特别敌意的反应。当一名男护士在拉斐尔喜欢的床边逗留太久时，他发出了一连串仇视同性恋的诽谤。一名护士长期驻扎在我们的门口监视他；我肯定这是一种自杀监视。</p><p> I had assumed Rafael had grown up poor but he said his parents were wealthy. He said they’d essentially cut him off because of his involvement with drugs and gangs. On the phone, he pleaded with his mother to help him get settled in an apartment, or at least a hotel room.</p><p>我原以为拉斐尔家境贫寒，但他说他的父母很富有。他说，他们基本上切断了他的联系，因为他与毒品和帮派有牵连。在电话里，他恳求母亲帮他在公寓里安顿下来，或者至少在酒店房间里安顿下来。</p><p> “Mum, I am dying in the street little by little and you don’t seem to care,” he said. “I understand I’m a difficult person to deal with, but you are some of the most selfish people I have ever met in my life.” Then he hung up.</p><p>“妈妈，我正一点点地在街上死去，而你似乎并不在意，”他说。“我知道我是个很难相处的人，但你是我这辈子见过的最自私的人。”然后他挂断了电话。</p><p> While Rafael’s parents were refusing to help him, my dad was about to board a plane to travel from Australia to look after me while I recovered. I had an apartment to go home to and a well-paid, rewarding job. Luckily, my employee medical insurance covered what I’m sure were mortifyingly expensive medical bills.</p><p>当拉斐尔的父母拒绝帮助他时，我父亲正要登上飞机从澳大利亚赶来照顾我，等待我康复。我有一套公寓可以回家，还有一份高薪、有价值的工作。幸运的是，我的员工医疗保险涵盖了我确信是极其昂贵的医疗账单。</p><p> By this stage I was able to get out of bed and hobble around the room. With the help of a nurse, I’d managed to get out of bed for the first time two days after the surgery. I felt exhausted and full of pride afterwards, as if I had completed a marathon rather than simply walking a few steps to the door and back.</p><p>到了这个阶段，我可以起床，在房间里一瘸一拐地走来走去了。手术后两天，在护士的帮助下，我第一次下了床。赛后我感到筋疲力尽，充满了自豪，就像我完成了一场马拉松一样，而不是简单地走几步到门口再回来。</p><p> Because of my back and shoulder injuries, I was hunched over and found it hard to balance myself. The occupational therapists taught me to walk with a wider stance, which made me chuckle: I felt like Nathan Lane in  The Birdcage, impersonating John Wayne in a bid to pull off a manly gait.</p><p>因为背部和肩部受伤，我弓着腰，发现自己很难保持平衡。职业治疗师教我用更宽的姿势走路，这让我咯咯地笑起来：我感觉自己就像鸟笼里的内森·莱恩(Nathan Lane)，模仿约翰·韦恩(John Wayne)，试图实现一种男子汉气概的步态。</p><p> In a trauma ward, you go quickly from being a top priority to an afterthought. As my discharge date approached, the occupational therapists stopped coming by and so did the doctors. After a week in the hospital, the staff were ready for me to leave, and I was, too.</p><p>在创伤病房里，你很快就会从头等大事变成次要任务。随着我出院日期的临近，职业治疗师不再来了，医生们也不再来了。在医院住了一周后，工作人员准备好让我出院了，我也是。</p><p> On the day I was due to leave, I woke up early and watched the sun rise over the East River. I felt like a little kid on Christmas Day. My stomach fluttered with excitement and trepidation about the idea of returning to the outside world.</p><p>在我要离开的那一天，我很早就起床了，看着太阳从东河上升起。在圣诞节那天，我感觉自己就像个小孩子。想到要回到外面的世界，我的胃又兴奋又害怕。</p><p>  To my shock, my father, who had arrived in New York the night before, suddenly walked into the room. Despite the strict COVID lockdown, the guard at the front desk had allowed him to wander in. Worried we were going to get in trouble, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. It was a tremendous relief to walk through the hospital doors and into the sunshine. Jacob Greber, the US correspondent for  The Australian Financial Review, had kindly offered to give us a lift home, and we hit the highway to Washington.</p><p>令我震惊的是，前一天晚上到达纽约的父亲突然走进房间。尽管COVID被严格封锁，前台的警卫还是允许他漫步进去。担心我们会有麻烦，我想尽快离开那里。走进医院的大门，走进阳光下，这是一种巨大的解脱。雅各布·格雷伯，“澳大利亚金融评论”的美国记者，好心地提出让我们搭便车回家，我们就上了去华盛顿的高速公路。</p><p> My recovery process over the next few weeks was not without its frustrations. Because of my back and shoulder injuries, I could not stay in one position for more than a couple of hours at a time. I couldn’t walk far but I couldn’t sit still for long, either.</p><p>在接下来的几周里，我的康复过程并不是没有挫折。由于背部和肩部受伤，我一次不能保持一个姿势超过几个小时。我不能走远，但我也不能久坐不动。</p><p> I would wake up several times each night and have to take painkillers and pace around the room before I could get back to sleep. I needed my dad’s help to tie up my shoelaces, put on a shirt and reach for anything above my eye level. He had to cut up my meals into small pieces, as you would for a young child.</p><p>我每晚都会醒来好几次，吃止痛药，在房间里走来走去，然后才能睡着。我需要爸爸帮我系鞋带，穿上衬衫，伸手去拿任何高于我眼睛高度的东西。他不得不把我的饭菜切成小块，就像你给小孩子做的那样。</p><p> Day by day, things got bet</p><p>一天又一天，一切都在打赌。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/i-was-howling-in-pain-how-falling-five-storeys-from-a-new-york-rooftop-changed-my-life-20200910-p55u9y.html">https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/i-was-howling-in-pain-how-falling-five-storeys-from-a-new-york-rooftop-changed-my-life-20200910-p55u9y.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/纽约/">#纽约</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/storeys/">#storeys</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
