It’s important to know what is inflationary, and what isn’t, and to what extent.</p><p>由于2020年政策性质极端，大规模财政支出、央行资产负债表大幅增加，以及央行通胀目标发生变化，这场辩论是很自然的。重要的是要知道什么是通货膨胀，什么不是，以及通货膨胀的程度。</p><p> Because people have very different understandings of how central bank policy and fiscal policy work, there have been analyst calls this year ranging from hyperinflation to deep deflation, and everything in between.</p><p>由于人们对央行政策和财政政策的运作方式有非常不同的理解，今年的分析师电话会议从恶性通胀到深度通缩，以及介于两者之间的一切。</p><p> The outcome has of course been somewhere in the middle as measured by CPI or PCE, with inflation that rebounded from March lows in response to policy, but neither much of an overshoot or undershoot, and still generally below long-term central bank inflation targets.</p><p>当然，以CPI或PCE衡量，结果一直处于中间水平，通胀受到政策的影响，从3月份的低点反弹，但既不是超调，也不是欠调，总体上仍低于央行的长期通胀目标。</p><p> Many inflation categories for the most essential and non-outsourced goods and services, however, have risen faster than the overall basket this year, and in recent years.</p><p>然而，今年和最近几年，最基本和非外包商品和服务的许多通胀类别的上涨速度都快于整体篮子。</p><p> The crux of this article is that quantitative easing on its own, and quantitative easing combined with massive fiscal deficits, are two very different situations to consider when it comes to analyzing the possibilities between inflation and deflation, and what constitutes “money printing”.</p><p>本文的症结在于，在分析通胀和通缩之间的可能性，以及什么构成“印钞”时，量化宽松本身和量化宽松与巨额财政赤字是两种截然不同的情况.。</p><p>  Before diving into the mechanisms of money-printing, it helps to set the stage. Context is key.</p><p>在深入研究印钞机制之前，先做好准备。上下文是关键。</p><p> Historically speaking, we’re coming down from the apex of, and currently within the lengthy resolution process of, a  long-term debt cycle, which refers to a multi-decade peak in public and private debts relative to the size of the economy and money supply. This occurs in the aftermath of when interest rates hit zero.</p><p>从历史上讲，我们正在从长期债务周期的顶峰下降，目前处于长期债务周期的漫长解决过程中，长期债务周期指的是公共和私人债务相对于经济和货币供应的规模达到数十年来的峰值。这发生在利率降至零之后。</p><p> We’ve been in this resolution process for the past 12 years, and the previous time before that was the two-decade period of the 1930’s and 1940’s where we hit the previous apex of a long-term debt cycle.</p><p>我们在过去的12年里一直在进行这个解决过程，上一次是在20世纪30年代和40年代，当时我们达到了长期债务周期的前一个顶峰。</p><p> Here is total debt as a % of GDP in the United States over the past century in blue on the left axis (all debts, public and private), along with short-term interest rates in orange on the right axis:</p><p>以下是美国过去一个世纪的总债务占GDP的百分比，左轴为蓝色(所有债务，公共和私人债务)，右轴为橙色的短期利率：</p><p>   And here is total debt as a % of the broad money supply, which shows the structural peaks of each cycle even more clearly (since policymakers have more influence over broad money supply than GDP, due to shifting monetary velocity):</p><p>这里是总债务占广义货币供应量的百分比，它更清楚地显示了每个周期的结构性峰值(因为由于货币速度的变化，政策制定者对广义货币供应量的影响力比GDP更大)：</p><p>   If we break out federal debt from non-federal debt (households, businesses, states, financial leverage, etc), we see two distinct peaks in each long-term cycle. Non-federal debt (orange line) peaks first in a commercial banking crisis (early 1930’s and late 2000’s), and then federal debt (blue line) peaks many years later in a sovereign debt crisis (mid-1940’s and ???-2020’s):</p><p>如果我们将联邦债务与非联邦债务(家庭、企业、州、财务杠杆等)分开，我们会在每个长期周期中看到两个明显的峰值。非联邦债务(橙线)首先在商业银行危机中见顶(20世纪30年代初和2000年末)，然后是多年后在主权债务危机中见顶的联邦债务(蓝线)(20世纪40年代中期和？-2020年)：</p><p>    High private debt levels are deflationary, since it makes consumers and businesses financially restrained and risk-adverse.</p><p>高私人债务水平是通货紧缩的，因为它使消费者和企业在财务上受到限制，不愿承担风险。</p><p>    Commodity oversupply is deflationary, since it cheapens the building blocks we use for everything else.</p><p>大宗商品供过于求是通缩的，因为它降低了我们用于其他一切的基石的价格。</p><p> Outsourcing is deflationary, since it lowers labor costs of goods and puts downward pressure on domestic wages.</p><p>外包是通缩的，因为它降低了商品的劳动力成本，并给国内工资带来了下行压力。</p><p> In a low-debt system, structural deflation for some of the positive reasons, such as technological improvement, would be a good thing. It means your money’s purchasing power grows over time, as higher productivity from technological enhancements lowers the cost of goods or improves their quality, so you get more value for your dollar.</p><p>在一个低负债的体系中，出于一些积极的原因(如技术进步)而出现结构性通缩将是一件好事。这意味着你的钱的购买力随着时间的推移而增长，因为技术进步带来的更高的生产率降低了商品的成本或改善了商品的质量，所以你的钱更值。</p><p> However, in an extraordinarily high-debt system (which requires a lot of central policy intervention in the first place to be able to get up that high), deflation breaks things and results in widespread defaults, because the cost of servicing debts goes up relative to cash flows.</p><p>然而，在一个异常高的债务体系中(这首先需要大量的中央政策干预才能达到如此高的水平)，通货紧缩会打破局面，导致广泛的违约，因为偿债成本相对于现金流会上升。</p><p> So, fiscal and monetary policymakers deliberately push back on deflationary forces with inflationary policy, especially when it gets to those extremes. And there are a few definitions or types of inflation that we can identify.</p><p>因此，财政和货币政策制定者故意用通胀政策来击退通缩力量，特别是在达到这些极端的时候。我们可以确定几种通胀的定义或类型。</p><p> Monetary inflation refers to the growth of the broad money supply, which can be calculated in a few ways but is pretty straightforward.</p><p>货币通胀指的是广义货币供应量的增长，可以用几种方法计算，但相当简单。</p><p> Asset price inflation refers to bubble-like increases in the prices of financial assets, like stocks, bonds, gold, private equity, fine art, and so forth. This is a bit more subjective because valuations on assets can vary, but there are various ratios to keep track of it in a broad sense.</p><p>资产价格通胀是指股票、债券、黄金、私募股权、艺术品等金融资产价格的泡沫式上涨。这有点主观，因为资产的估值可能会有所不同，但广义上有各种比率可以跟踪。</p><p> Consumer price inflation refers to a broad rise in the prices of everyday goods and services, and people debate about how it should be measured. The government uses CPI and PCE calculations on a basket of goods, but those use various substitutions. There are alternative calculations that don’t use substitutes, which generally lead to higher figures.</p><p>消费价格通胀指的是日常商品和服务价格的普遍上涨，人们对应该如何衡量它展开了争论。政府对一篮子商品使用CPI和PCE计算，但这些使用了各种替代方法。还有一些不使用代换的替代计算，这通常会导致更高的数字。</p><p> Each household has their own unique basket of consumer goods and services that they buy. For research purposes, I calculated that my personal household consumer price inflation rate averaged about 3% per year over the past two years, taking into account our total purchases of non-investment goods and services.</p><p>每个家庭都有他们自己购买的一篮子独特的消费品和服务。为了进行研究，我计算出，过去两年，我的个人家庭消费价格通胀率平均每年约为3%，这还包括我们购买的所有非投资性商品和服务。</p><p>  Going into the 2008 crisis, U.S. banks were extremely leveraged, with very low bank reserves.</p><p>进入2008年危机时，美国银行的杠杆率极高，银行准备金非常低。</p><p> Large bank cash levels equaled just 3% of their assets (blue line below; cash as a percentage of total assets), and large bank holdings of Treasuries as a percentage of assets were pretty low historically as well (red line; treasury securities as a percentage of total assets):</p><p>大银行的现金水平仅相当于其资产的3%(下面的蓝线；现金占总资产的百分比)，大银行持有的美国国债占资产的百分比也相当低(红线；国债占总资产的百分比)：</p><p>   So, leading into the financial crisis, only about 13% of their assets consisted of cash (3%) and Treasury securities (10%). The rest of their assets were invested in loans and riskier securities. This was also at a time when household debt to GDP reached a record high, as consumers were caught up in the housing bubble.</p><p>因此，在金融危机之前，他们的资产中只有13%左右是现金(3%)和国债(10%)。他们其余的资产投资于贷款和风险更高的证券。这也是在家庭债务与GDP之比达到创纪录高位的时候，因为消费者被卷入了房地产泡沫。</p><p> That over-leveraged bank situation hit a climax into the 2008/2009 crisis, coinciding with record high debt-to-GDP among households, and was the apex of the long-term private (non-federal) debt cycle. When banks are that leveraged with very little cash reserves, even a 3% loss in assets results in insolvency. And that’s what happened; the banking system as a whole hit a peak total loan charge-off rate of over 3%, and it resulted in a widespread banking crisis.</p><p>这种过度杠杆化的银行状况在2008/2009年危机中达到高潮，恰逢家庭债务与GDP之比达到创纪录高位，也是长期私人(非联邦)债务周期的顶峰。当银行的杠杆率很低，现金储备很少时，即使是3%的资产损失也会导致资不抵债。事情就是这样发生的；整个银行体系的贷款总冲销率达到了峰值，超过了3%，这导致了一场广泛的银行业危机。</p><p> However, banks were bailed out via QE and the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was a top-down, anti-deflationary bank industry bailout, but not a bottom-up, pro-inflationary real economy bailout. TARP boosted bank solvency, and QE boosted bank liquidity.</p><p>然而，银行通过量化宽松和问题资产救助计划(TARP)得到了救助。这是一次自上而下的、反通货紧缩的银行业救助，但不是一次自下而上的、有利于通胀的实体经济救助。TARP提振银行偿付能力，QE提振银行流动性。</p><p> As the crisis played out and some banks failed and others were bailed out, regulators wanted to increase bank reserve requirements and capital requirements, requiring banks to hold a greater percent of their assets in cash reserves and other safe assets. The problem with that, however, is that banks can’t just magically boost up their reserves; they would have to sell other assets to get cash, but if every bank in the system sells assets to get cash, who do they sell to, and where would so much cash come from to buy what they sell?</p><p>随着危机的发展，一些银行倒闭，另一些银行得到救助，监管机构希望提高银行存款准备金率和资本金要求，要求银行以现金储备和其他安全资产的形式持有更大比例的资产。然而，这样做的问题是，银行不能仅仅神奇地增加准备金；它们将不得不出售其他资产来获得现金，但如果系统中的每一家银行都出售资产以获得现金，它们会出售给谁，这么多现金从哪里来购买他们出售的东西？</p><p> In other words, while it’s possible for an individual bank to boost its reserves by selling assets to raise capital, it’s mechanically impossible for the entire banking industry to collectively raise its reserves industry-wide.</p><p>换句话说，虽然个别银行可以通过出售资产筹集资本来提高准备金，但整个银行业从机械上讲不可能整体提高整个行业的准备金。</p><p> So, in the role of lender/buyer of last resort, the Federal Reserve created new cash reserves out of thin air, gave them to the banks, and took some of their Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities in return, aka quantitative easing or QE. Along with TARP, this recapitalized banks, bringing them from 3% cash as a percentage of assets at the start of 2008, to 8% by the end of 2008. The Fed did further rounds of QE through 2014 that brought banks collectively up to 15% cash levels, which brought them up to frothy levels of excess reserves.</p><p>因此，作为最后贷款人/买家的角色，美联储(Federal Reserve)凭空创造了新的现金储备，将其交给银行，并将部分美国国债和抵押贷款支持证券(MBS)作为回报，即量化宽松(QE)。与问题资产救助计划一起，这对银行进行了资本重组，使银行的现金占资产的比例从2008年初的3%上升到2008年底的8%。美联储在2014年之前又实施了几轮量化宽松，使银行的现金水平总体上达到了15%，这使得它们的超额准备金达到了泡沫水平。</p><p> This, however, didn’t result in more money chasing fewer goods and services, and therefore wasn’t particularly inflationary for every prices. The money remained mostly internal to the banking system, at higher reserve levels. Broad money supply didn’t increase rapidly.</p><p>然而，这并没有导致更多的钱追逐更少的商品和服务，因此对每个价格来说都不是特别通胀。这些资金大多留在银行系统内部，处于较高的储备水平。广义货币供应量增长不快。</p><p> Many analysts that were worried about inflation missed the fact that the transmission mechanism from QE to the real economy was small, so this was mostly just a bank-recapitalization process. Banks and their executives got a nice assist from the Fed and Treasury, but the broad public did not. Banks didn’t lend much of the money out (nor was there a ton of creditworthy demand for them to do so), and fiscal spending didn’t go around the banking channel very much either.</p><p>许多担心通胀的分析师忽略了一个事实，即从量化宽松到实体经济的传导机制很小，因此这大多只是一个银行资本重组过程。银行及其高管从美联储和财政部得到了很好的帮助，但广大公众并没有。银行并没有借出太多的钱(也没有大量有信誉的需求要求他们这样做)，财政支出也没有太多绕过银行渠道。</p><p> A similar version of this played out in the 1930’s, which was the previous time that interest rates hit the zero bound at the apex of a long-term private debt cycle. The banking system collapsed back then too, so policymakers devalued the dollar vs the gold peg, expanded the monetary base, and recapitalized banks during a banking holiday. This was enough to offset the deep deflation that was happening in the early 1930’s, and turn it back into a reflationary trend in the mid-1930’s, but not enough to cause rapid broad consumer price inflation. It was anti-deflationary, in other words, but not outright inflationary.</p><p>类似的版本在20世纪30年代上演，那是上一次利率在长期私人债务周期的顶峰触及零界限。银行体系当时也崩溃了，因此政策制定者在银行业假期期间让美元对盯住黄金的汇率贬值，扩大了货币基础，并对银行进行了资本重组。这足以抵消20世纪30年代初发生的深度通缩，并在30年代中期将其重新转变为通货再膨胀趋势，但还不足以导致迅速而广泛的消费价格通胀。换句话说，它是反通货紧缩的，但不是彻底的通胀。</p><p>  All told, the Fed expanded their balance sheet by about $3.5 trillion from mid-2008 to the end of 2014. They created new bank reserves to buy Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>从2008年中期到2014年底，美联储总共扩大了约3.5万亿美元的资产负债表。他们创造了新的银行储备来购买美国国债和抵押贷款支持证券。</p><p> Many folks thought this would be hyperinflationary, Weimar Republic style. So, they bid up the price of gold rather high. I’m glad they felt that way, because I sold my gold to them in 2011, during a period of very high sentiment. It’s the only time I sold physical bullion. I wanted to load up on historically cheap stocks instead.</p><p>许多人认为这会是魏玛共和国式的恶性通货膨胀。所以，他们把金价抬高到相当高的水平。我很高兴他们有这种感觉，因为我在2011年将黄金卖给了他们，当时市场情绪非常高涨。这是我唯一一次卖实物金条。相反，我想买入历史上最便宜的股票。</p><p> Here was the gold price relative to my model (i.e. orange area way above blue line):</p><p>以下是相对于我的模型的金价(即远远高于蓝线的橙色区域)：</p><p>     Of course, this QE ended up not being outright inflationary for consumer prices, for reasons described before. It was anti-deflationary, rather than outright inflationary. Along with low rates, it was somewhat inflationary for asset prices, but not most consumer prices. That’s how it worked in the 1930’s, too.</p><p>当然，出于前面描述的原因，这次量化宽松最终并不是消费者价格的直接通胀。它是反通货紧缩的，而不是直接的通货膨胀。与低利率一起，这对资产价格有一定的通胀作用，但不是大多数消费者价格。这也是它在20世纪30年代的运作方式。</p><p> We can put some broad numbers on it. From 2007 to 2009, there was a $11 trillion decline in U.S. household net worth, as it fell from $71 trillion to $60 trillion, due to a decline in stock and house prices. It then took about five years for U.S. household net worth to recover to previous highs. This was $11 trillion in deflationary wealth destruction (plus technology improvements, and commodity oversupply, tightened credit for home equity loans, and other deflationary forces), up against the response of $3.5 trillion in Fed bank reserve creation or QE. Of course it wouldn’t be hyperinflationary.</p><p>我们可以给它加上一些宽泛的数字。从2007年到2009年，由于股票和房价下跌，美国家庭净资产减少了11万亿美元，从71万亿美元下降到60万亿美元。然后，美国家庭净资产花了大约五年的时间才恢复到以前的高点。这是11万亿美元的通货紧缩财富破坏(加上技术进步、大宗商品供应过剩、房屋净值贷款信贷收紧和其他通缩力量)，而美联储创造银行储备或量化宽松的回应是3.5万亿美元。当然，这不会是恶性通货膨胀。</p><p>  Moreover, as previously-described, most of the $3.5 trillion never entered the broad money supply because there was no major fiscal transfer mechanism, so it mostly just stayed in bank reserves. It offset a deflationary shock and bank collapse by recapitalizing the banking system with higher levels of solvency and liquidity (and thus was anti-deflationary), but it was not outright inflationary.</p><p>而且，如前所述，由于没有重大的财政转移机制，3.5万亿美元中的大部分从未进入广义货币供应量，因此大多只是停留在银行储备中。它通过用更高水平的偿付能力和流动性对银行系统进行资本重组来抵消通货紧缩冲击和银行倒闭(因此是反通货紧缩的)，但并不是彻底的通货膨胀。</p><p>  Banks, in practice, are limited in how much leverage and risk they can take by their regulatory capital requirements. In this model, there are some very low-risk assets (like bank reserves, Treasury securities, and gold) that don’t count against the bank’s risk level, and there are higher-risk assets (like personal loans, or corporate bonds) that do count against a bank’s overall risk level. Banks need to maintain an appropriate balance of assets to avoid being considered too risk-heavy.</p><p>实际上，银行受到监管资本要求的限制，它们可以承担的杠杆率和风险是有限的。在这个模型中，有一些非常低风险的资产(如银行准备金、国债和黄金)不计入银行的风险水平，而有一些风险较高的资产(如个人贷款或公司债券)确实计入了银行的总体风险水平。银行需要保持适当的资产平衡，以避免被认为风险过高。</p><p> In some regulation regimes, banks can also be constrained by reserve requirements, meaning that banks are required to have a certain percentage of deposits stored as cash reserves.</p><p>在一些监管制度中，银行还可以受到准备金要求的约束，这意味着要求银行将一定比例的存款作为现金储备储存起来。</p><p> Suppose that there is a regulatory rule which says that all banks must have an amount of cash equal to 5% of their customer bank deposits (which are liabilities for banks; owed to their customers) held in reserve at the Federal Reserve. So, if a bank has $100 billion in customer bank deposits held with them (which are liabilities for the bank), and $110 billion in assets (and so they have $10 billion more assets than liabilities), they can put up to $105 billion of their assets into various forms (making loans, buying securities, etc), but must hold at least $5 billion in cash reserves at their account with the Fed.</p><p>假设有一个监管规则，规定所有银行必须有相当于其客户银行存款(银行的负债；欠客户的)5%的现金作为储备存放在美联储。因此，如果一家银行有1000亿美元的客户银行存款(这是银行的负债)和1100亿美元的资产(因此他们的资产比负债多100亿美元)，它们可以将高达1050亿美元的资产投入各种形式(放贷、购买证券等)，但必须在美联储的账户上持有至少50亿美元的现金储备。</p><p> Here is a reserve-constrained bank example. A bank has $100 billion in deposits (liabilities), and $110 billion in assets. Of their assets, $5 billion is in cash reserves, $20 billion is in Treasuries, $10 billion is in mortgage-backed securities, and $75 billion is in other assets (personal loans, mortgage loans, corporate loans, and/or whatever else). This bank can’t lend anymore, until either it collects more deposits which would also boost reserves, or sells some existing assets. It is therefore reserve-constrained. It might want to lend, and has good client demand to lend money to, but it simply can’t leverage itself anymore. If the Fed were to create $5 billion in brand new reserves (aka QE) and buy $5 billion of their Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities, it would alleviate their reserve-constrained status, and the bank could use that $5 billion to lend more, or buy more securities. This would be economically stimulative if the bank wants to lend money, because now the bank can go ahead and lend that money, and thus create deposits somewhere in the system and increase the broad money supply.</p><p>以下是一个准备金受限的银行例子。一家银行有1000亿美元的存款(负债)和1100亿美元的资产。在他们的资产中，50亿美元是现金储备，200亿美元是国债，100亿美元是抵押贷款支持证券，750亿美元是其他资产(个人贷款、抵押贷款、公司贷款和/或其他任何资产)。这家银行不能再放贷了，除非它吸收更多的存款，这也会增加准备金，或者出售一些现有的资产。因此，它受到储量的限制。它可能想放贷，而且有良好的客户需求可以借钱给它，但它就是不能再杠杆化了。如果美联储创造50亿美元的全新储备(又名QE)，并购买50亿美元的美国国债或抵押贷款支持证券，这将缓解它们受到准备金限制的状况，银行可以用这50亿美元来发放更多贷款，或购买更多证券。如果银行想放贷，这将会刺激经济，因为现在银行可以放贷，从而在系统中的某个地方创造存款，增加广义货币供应。</p><p> Here is a non-reserve-constrained example. A bank has $100 billion in deposits (liabilities) and $110 billion in total assets. Of their assets, $15 billion is in cash reserves, $20 billion is in Treasuries, $10 billion is in mortgage-backed securities, and $65 billion is in other assets. This bank has $10 billion in excess reserves above the $5 billion requirement; extra money it can lend. Maybe it doesn’t want to lend right now; it doesn’t see any good risk-adjusted loans to make. Or maybe there isn’t a lot of demand from its clients to borrow money. So, it’s just holding that extra $10 billion as excess reserves, in addition to their $5 billion required reserves. If the Fed were to do QE and buy $5 billion of their Treasuries, and bring the bank up to $20 billion in reserves, it won’t affect how much they lend, because they weren’t reserve-constrained to begin with. This would not be stimulative and would not increase the broad money supply, since it doesn’t coerce the bank to make any more loans.</p><p>以下是一个不受储量限制的示例。一家银行有1000亿美元的存款(负债)和1100亿美元的总资产。在他们的资产中，150亿美元是现金储备，200亿美元是国债，100亿美元是抵押贷款支持证券，650亿美元是其他资产。这家银行有100亿美元的超额准备金，超过了50亿美元的要求；它可以放贷额外的资金。也许它现在不想放贷；它看不到任何好的风险调整后的贷款可以发放。或者，可能它的客户对借钱的需求不是很大。因此，除了50亿美元的法定准备金之外，它只是持有额外的100亿美元作为超额准备金。如果美联储实施量化宽松，购买50亿美元的国债，并将银行的储备提高到200亿美元，这不会影响他们借出的金额，因为他们一开始就不受准备金限制。这不会起到刺激作用，也不会增加广义货币供应量，因为它不会迫使银行发放更多贷款。</p><p> That is why QE alone isn’t inflationary. Increasing bank reserves does not necessarily increase the broad money supply. A rapidly increasing broad money supply along with constraints on the supply of goods and services, is what can lead to inflation.</p><p>这就是仅靠量化宽松不会引发通胀的原因。增加银行准备金并不一定会增加广义货币供应量。快速增长的广义货币供应量以及对商品和服务供应的限制，是可能导致通胀的原因。</p><p> There are two ways to increase broad money supply. Either banks need to lend, or the federal government can go around them and run big fiscal deficits. At the apex of a long-term debt cycle, the latter tends to happen.</p><p>增加广义货币供应量有两种方式。要么银行需要放贷，要么联邦政府可以绕过它们，运行巨额财政赤字。在长期债务周期的顶峰，后一种情况往往会发生。</p><p>  Now in 2020, in the next recession twelve years after the 2008 banking crisis, we’re back at it and bigger than before, but with a twist.</p><p>现在到了2020年，在2008年银行业危机12年后的下一次衰退中，我们又回到了衰退中，规模比以前更大，但有了一个转折。</p><p> This time, going into the crisis, the banking system was already well-capitalized. The percent of bank assets that consist of cash and Treasuries was already historically high. So, unlike 2008, banks weren’t over-leveraged. However, the broader economy was over-leveraged, and the pandemic hit the broader economy.</p><p>这一次，进入危机时，银行系统已经资本充足。由现金和美国国债组成的银行资产的百分比已经创下历史新高。因此，与2008年不同的是，银行没有过度杠杆化。然而，更广泛的经济被过度杠杆化，大流行打击了更广泛的经济。</p><p> Millions of people became unemployed, and countless businesses faced insolvency risk as their cash flows collapsed. For the Fed to simply buy Treasuries and MBS from banks wouldn’t do almost anything for this, because it’s not a bank recapitalization issue, and there would be no transmission mechanism to the public. Banks were already well-capitalized, and so the banks weren’t reserve-constrained.</p><p>数百万人失业，无数的企业面临破产风险，因为他们的现金流崩溃了。对于美联储来说，简单地从银行购买国债和MBS几乎不会对此做任何事情，因为这不是一个银行资本重组问题，也不会有任何向公众传递的机制。银行已经拥有充足的资本，所以银行不受准备金的限制。</p><p> Instead, this time, fiscal authorities (Congress and the President) spent trillions of dollars into the real non-bank economy, sending folks stimulus checks, boosting unemployment benefits by an extra $600/week (which is $2,400/month for several months for folks who received it), financing banks to give small businesses PPP loans that mostly turn into grants, and partially bailing out some of the hardest-hit corporate industries with fresh capital injections. It was a much larger stimulus than anything from 2008/2009.</p><p>取而代之的是，这一次，财政当局(国会和总统)向实体非银行经济投入了数万亿美元，向民众提供刺激支票，将失业救济金每周额外增加600美元(对于领取失业救济金的人来说，几个月内每月增加2400美元)，资助银行向小企业提供PPP贷款，这些贷款大多会转化为赠款，并通过新的注资部分救助一些受打击最严重的企业行业。这是一个比2008/2009年任何时候都大得多的刺激措施。</p><p> The way that the government’s accounting works in the current legal structure, is that they have to issue a lot of Treasury securities to fund that expenditure. However, the foreign sector was not really buying Treasuries, and in fact were selling some Treasuries early this year. So, who would be available to buy $3 trillion in extra Treasury securities this year?</p><p>在目前的法律结构下，政府会计工作的方式是，他们必须发行大量的国债来为这项支出提供资金。然而，外国部门并没有真正买入美国国债，事实上，他们在今年早些时候抛售了一些国债。那么，今年有谁可以额外购买3万亿美元的美国国债呢？</p><p> Enter the Fed again. When the Treasury market became illiquid in March from foreigners and hedge funds selling Treasuries against a backdrop of insufficient buyers, the Fed stepped in, and created $1 trillion in brand new bank reserves out of thin air to buy $1 trillion in Treasuries over a 3-week period. This was the most rapid asset-purchase program the Fed has ever done. And then they tapered that rate but kept buying Treasuries for months to soak up the massive 2020 Treasury issuance that funded all the stimulus, and are still buying tens of billions of dollars of Treasuries monthly with newly-created bank reserves to this day.</p><p>再次进入美联储。今年3月，当美国国债市场在买家不足的背景下因外国人和对冲基金抛售国债而变得缺乏流动性时，美联储出手干预，凭空创造了1万亿美元的全新银行储备，用于在3周内购买1万亿美元的国债。这是美联储有史以来最迅速的资产购买计划。然后他们缩减了利率，但几个月来一直在购买美国国债，以吸收2020年为所有刺激计划提供资金的大规模国债发行，直到今天，他们仍在用新创建的银行储备每月购买数百亿美元的美国国债。</p><p> So, the Fed once again increased its balance sheet (this time by nearly $3 trillion in just three months) to buy a large chunk of Treasuries, plus some other assets like mortgage-backed securities and a handful of corporate bonds. About $2 trillion, or 2/3rds of this 2020 balance sheet expansion so far, consisted of buying Treasuries. But what made this one different, was that it didn’t just stay in the banking system to recapitalize banks. It flowed through banks to the U.S. Treasury Department, which injected that money directly into the economy as authorized by Congress’ CARES Act.</p><p>因此，美联储再次增加了资产负债表(这一次在短短三个月内增加了近3万亿美元)，购买了大量美国国债，以及抵押贷款支持证券(MBS)和少数公司债券等其他一些资产。到目前为止，在2020年迄今的资产负债表扩张中，约有2万亿美元，即三分之二的资金包括购买公债。但这一次的不同之处在于，它不仅仅停留在银行系统中，对银行进行资本重组。它通过银行流向美国财政部，财政部根据国会“关爱法案”的授权将这笔资金直接注入经济。</p><p> This following chart shows the year-over-year change (in billions of dollars) of total U.S. commercial bank deposits in blue, government transfer payments in green, and the Fed’s balance sheet in red:</p><p>以下图表显示了美国商业银行存款总额的同比变化(以数十亿美元为单位)，蓝色为蓝色，政府转移支付为绿色，美联储资产负债表为红色：</p><p>   That chart is critical to see why 2020 and 2008 were quite different, and why the policy response acted so much quicker and more powerfully on financial markets and personal income this time. Personal income and net worth on a nationwide scale went up, rather than down, in 2020 so far.</p><p>这张图表至关重要，可以看出为什么2020年和2008年截然不同，为什么这一次政策反应对金融市场和个人收入的反应要快得多，力度也更大。到目前为止，到目前为止，全国范围内的个人收入和净资产在2020年非但没有下降，反而上升了。</p><p> In 2008-2014, there was a lot of QE (red line going up), but those dollars didn’t get out into public bank deposits (which is what mostly makes up the broad money supply). This was because there was little or no fiscal transmission mechanism; the government wasn’t sending huge checks to people. So, the green line (year-over-year change in government transfer payments) and blue line (year-over-year change in bank deposits) remained low. The QE process in 2008 mostly just recapitalized banks.</p><p>在2008-2014年，有大量的量化宽松(红线上升)，但这些美元没有进入公共银行存款(这是广义货币供应量的主要组成部分)。这是因为很少或根本没有财政传导机制；政府没有向人民发放巨额支票。因此，绿线(政府转移支付同比变化)和蓝线(银行存款同比变化)保持在较低水平。2008年的量化宽松进程大多只是对银行进行资本重组。</p><p> However, 2020 was a very different story. The government sent out tons of money directly into the economy, and financed it by issuing Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve created new bank reserves to buy. For legal reasons, the Fed buys those securities on the secondary market, but that doesn’t make much of a difference in practice; it’s where they end up and remain that matters. The banks that buy them from the Treasury and sell them to the Fed just act as pass-through entities in this case.</p><p>然而，2020年是一个非常不同的故事。政府直接向经济投入了数以吨计的资金，并通过发行美国国债为其融资，美联储(Federal Reserve)创造了新的银行储备来购买这些债券。出于法律原因，美联储在二级市场上购买这些证券，但这在实践中没有太大区别；重要的是它们最终在哪里并保持不变。在这种情况下，从财政部购买这些债券并将其出售给美联储的银行只是充当传递实体。</p><p> So, the blue, green, and red lines all went vertical in 2020, unlike the 2008-2014 period. The government sent money to people and businesses (green line), that money showed up in their bank deposits (blue line) and thus in the broad money supply, and the Fed created new bank reserves to buy a lot of the Treasury securities issued to fund that program (red line).</p><p>因此，与2008-2014年期间不同的是，蓝线、绿线和红线在2020年都是垂直的。政府向个人和企业发送资金(绿线)，这些钱出现在他们的银行存款(蓝线)中，从而出现在广义货币供应中，美联储创造了新的银行储备，以购买大量为该计划提供资金而发行的国债(红线)。</p><p> Or, put simply, the broad money supply went up a lot in 2020, but didn’t budge nearly as much in 2008/2009 (in either absolute or percent terms), becau</p><p>或者，简单地说，2020年广义货币供应量增加了很多，但在2008/2009年(无论是绝对值还是百分比)几乎没有那么大的变动，因为。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.lynalden.com/money-printing/">https://www.lynalden.com/money-printing/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/银行/">#银行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/qe/">#qe</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1031082.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_cbf95742fadd095622384ababd7800aa.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1031082.html">库迪：如何在经济衰退中幸存-12种创造性的在线赚钱方式</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-25 18:35</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030747.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_82a227431e4766850482919b5f3d3cff.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030747.html">
