charging ahead with a sequel to the device, and now we have the first credible pictures of it. The story here is kind of weird. We&#39;re not actually sure where the pictures are from (they&#39;ve been uploaded to  this random YouTube channel\u00a0with other uncredited content), but  Windows Central&#39;s Zac Bowden says the images are legit, and since he has had an impeccable history of nailing Surface Duo rumors, his affirmation is good enough for us.\u00a0Bowden calls the two devices shown off in the leak &#34;near-final prototypes.&#34;\n The most obvious change in the pictures is a huge camera bump on the back of the device. The bump houses three cameras, along with what looks like an LED flash to the right and one more sensor, perhaps laser autofocus, just below the flash. The standalone fingerprint reader on the side is gone (Windows Central speculates it will be integrated into the power button), and the USB-C port on the bottom is now centered. Sadly, we don&#39;t know what the inside looks like yet.\n The Surface Duo 1 never had a good camera solution\u2014in fact, it didn&#39;t have a rear camera at all. Cameras are one of the biggest thickness demands on a phone body (hence the camera bumps), and the Surface Duo, being one of the thinnest phones ever made (at only 4.8 mm thick for each half), simply didn&#39;t have room for a good camera. The device only got one low-quality front camera, and since the phone was foldable, it could pull double-duty as a rear camera, too.\n  Skipping out on a rear camera for the Duo 1 wasn&#39;t the only solution Microsoft tried, though\u2014early prototypes showed a rear camera with a corresponding divot on the other half of the device, allowing the proto-Duo to have a rear camera bump and still fold flat. This Duo 2 prototype has a big camera bump but no divot on the other side, so it looks like it won&#39;t fold flat? A big selling point of the first Duo was the 360 hinge and the ability to use it in single-screen mode if you wanted, but it seems like that feature is being compromised. Another problem with the Duo 1 was its weird and out-of-date spec sheet, but many of the device&#39;s technical shortcomings will be fixed in the sequel.\u00a0Windows Central says the phone will ship with a modern SoC\u2014the  Snapdragon 888\u2014along with NFC, one of the more bizarre omissions of the Duo 1. The phone should ship sometime in September or October.\n     The Surface Duo 1 was Microsoft&#39;s first-ever self-branded Android phone and the company&#39;s first swing at a smartphone since the Nokia Windows Phone days. By all accounts, the Duo 1 was a disaster. In  our time with it, we experienced a ton of bugs and glaring software deficiencies, like its poor keyboard. But our big takeaway was that\u00a0the form factor didn&#39;t work. Even when folded up, the Duo 1 was significantly wider than any other device on the market, eclipsing even historically huge phones like the Nexus 6 by 10 mm, which made it uncomfortable to hold or shove into a pocket. Android doesn&#39;t scale well to ultra-wide screens (tall is fine, wide is not), so the phone didn&#39;t show much content.\n The two-screen design also wasn&#39;t that compelling. A tablet or foldable can offer similar side-by-side app action and also provide the flexibility of a single big screen for videos and tablet apps, which isn&#39;t viable on the split-screen Duo. The Duo also didn&#39;t have a front screen for notifications, which is a standard feature on every other foldable device like the Galaxy Fold and Flip, the Moto Razr, and the Xiaomi and Huawei foldables. When your phone beeps, you want to be able to glance at it to see the notification without having to use two hands to open and close the device. It does not seem like any of these issues will be addressed in the sequel.\n The Surface Duo was a failure in the market, too, with discounts starting nearly immediately. Today, the sky-high $1,400 MSRP is down to almost $1,000 off. The hottest fire sale saw Duos being unloaded for\u00a0 $409, but today, these things are just sitting around  in Amazon warehouses for $419, and they still aren&#39;t selling out. You would think that a serious market flop like the Duo 1 would lead to dramatic changes in the sequel, but Microsoft does not seem deterred.\n The company can at least fix some of the buggy software and out-of-date hardware it shipped with the Duo 1. But if you weren&#39;t a fan of the concept before, the Duo 2 isn&#39;t trying to do much to change your mind.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:18:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,duo", "title": "\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684 Microsoft Surface Duo 2 \u6cc4\u6f0f", "title_en": "Here\u2019s the first credible Microsoft Surface Duo 2 leak", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/heres-the-first-credible-microsoft-surface-duo-2-leak/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "duo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4efa3fc8f778a16309b09d9bacd88500.jpg", "infoid": 1069831, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u5934\u76d4\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e3d\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6cbb\u7597\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u7a81\u7834\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u5934\u76d4\u4ea7\u751f\u78c1\u573a\u5c06\u81f4\u547d\u80bf\u7624\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7597\u7684 53 \u5c81\u60a3\u8005\u6700\u7ec8\u56e0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u53bb\u4e16\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5c38\u68c0\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u624b\u672f\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5207\u9664\u4e86 31% \u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5757\u3002\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e3a\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u7684\u81f4\u547d\u8111\u764c\u7684\u65e0\u521b\u7597\u6cd5\u3002\u5934\u76d4\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u4e09\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c\u78c1\u94c1\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u53ef\u5145\u7535\u7535\u6c60\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u8bca\u6240\u4f69\u6234\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u4e94\u5468\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u59bb\u5b50\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u56de\u5bb6\u3002\u5934\u76d4\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u7597\u6cd5\u6700\u521d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u6bcf\u5929\u6700\u591a\u516d\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u5242\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u8005\u2014\u2014\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86 FDA \u7684\u540c\u60c5\u4f7f\u7528\u6cbb\u7597\u2014\u2014\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u6709\u671d\u4e00\u65e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\u8111\u764c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u653e\u7597\u6216\u5316\u7597\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u2026\u2026\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u521b\u548c\u65e0\u6bd2\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u2026\u2026\u672a\u6765\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u201d\u901a\u8baf\u4f5c\u8005\u517c\u80af\u5c3c\u65af\u00b7R\u00b7\u76ae\u514b\u8111\u548c\u5782\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4efb\u5927\u536b\u00b7\u5df4\u65af\u91d1\u8bf4\u3002\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u536b\u7406\u516c\u4f1a\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u524d\u6cbf\u6742\u5fd7\u4e0a\u3002", "note_en": "We\u2019ve seen  helmets and  AI that can spot brain tumors, but a new hard hat can actually treat them, too. As part of the latest neurological  breakthrough, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately passed away due to an unrelated injury. But, an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31 percent of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.\n The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day. During the period, the patient\u2019s tumor mass and volume shrunk by nearly a third, with shrinkage appearing to correlate with the treatment dose.\n The inventors of the device \u2014 which received FDA approval for compassionate use treatment \u2014 claim it could one day help treat brain cancer without radiation or chemotherapy. \u201cOur results\u2026open a new world of non-invasive and nontoxic therapy\u2026with many exciting possibilities for the future,\u201d said David S.

He has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including bringing a firearm to the Capitol grounds and a charge of obstructing justice. His Windows laptop was one of several devices seized by the FBI, which investigators said was protected with a password, but that it could also be unlocked using Reffitt\u2019s face.\n Prosecutors said forensic evidence suggested that the laptop contained gigabytes of footage from Reffitt\u2019s helmet-worn camera that he allegedly used to record some of the riot, and asked the court if it could compel Reffitt to sit in front of the computer to unlock it.\n Reffitt\u2019s lawyer told the court that his client could \u201cnot remember\u201d the password, but the court sided with the government and  granted the motion to compel his biometrics. Reffitt\u2019s lawyer told CNN, which  first reported the court order, that the laptop is now unlocked.\n The government took advantage of a loophole in the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional right that grants anyone in the U.S. the right to remain silent, which includes the right to not turn over information that could implicate themselves in a crime,  such as a password. But some courts have ruled that those protections don\u2019t extend to a person\u2019s physical attributes that can be used in place of a password, such as a face scan or fingerprint.\n In Reffitt\u2019s indictment, the FBI said as such, arguing that compelling Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it \u201cwould not run afoul of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\u201d\n Courts across the U.S. are still divided on the reading of the Fifth Amendment and whether or not it applies to the compelled use of a person\u2019s biometrics. The U.S. Supreme Court isn\u2019t likely to address the issue any time soon, rejecting two petitions in as many years to rule on the matter, leaving it largely up to the states to decide.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:17:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u7535\u8111,\u547d\u4ee4,orders,reffitt", "title": "\u6cd5\u9662\u547d\u4ee4\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u4f1a\u66b4\u5f92\u201c\u7528\u8138\u201d\u89e3\u9501\u4ed6\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCourt orders US Capitol rioter to unlock his laptop \u2018with his face\u2019\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/court-orders-us-capitol-rioter-to-unlock-his-laptop-with-his-face/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u7535\u8111", "\u547d\u4ee4", "orders", "reffitt"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9f9615d120a4ccf38d0b9360b0e49746.jpg", "infoid": 1069829, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5e03\u9c81\u585e\u5c14\uff0c7 \u6708 26 \u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 -

France, Spain, Italy and 20 other EU countries may be taken to court for their tardiness in enacting landmark EU copyright rules into national law, the European Commission said on Monday as it asked the group to explain the delays.\n The copyright rules, adopted two years ago, aim to ensure a level playing field between the European Union&#39;s trillion-euro creative industries and online platforms such as Google, owned by Alphabet  (GOOGL.O), and Facebook  (FB.O).\n Some of Europe&#39;s artists and broadcasters, however, are still not happy, in particular over the interpretation of a key provision, Article 17, which is intended to force sharing platforms such as YouTube and Instagram to filter copyrighted content.\n The Commission said it had sent letters of formal notice, the first step of its infringement proceedings, to the countries group asking for explanations. The deadline for enacting the EU rules was June 7.\n The other countries are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n They have two months to respond to the Commission or receive a warning, known as a reasoned opinion. The next step is a referral to the EU&#39;s top court in Luxembourg.\n The EU executive also said it had asked France, Spain and 19 other EU countries to explain why they missed a June 7 deadline to enact separate copyright rules for online transmission of radio and TV programmes.\n The other countries are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:09:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7248\u6743,copyright,\u6b27\u76df", "title": "\u6b27\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c31\u7248\u6743\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9 23 \u4e2a\u6b27\u76df\u56fd\u5bb6\u63d0\u8d77\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8bc9\u8bbc", "title_en": "European Commission Starts Legal Action Against 23 EU Countries Over Copyright Rules", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/commission-starts-legal-action-against-23-eu-countries-over-copyright-rules-2021-07-26/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7248\u6743", "copyright", "\u6b27\u76df"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6ec47d52df5d73e743114a6bb9c23546.jpeg", "infoid": 1069828, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e09\u5341\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u95f4\u65ad\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u5730\u6253\u6270\u6211\u4eec\u3002\u72ec\u7acb\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d7\u5230\u5632\u7b11\u3002", "note_en": "Thirty years ago our managers enabled uninterrupted work.
