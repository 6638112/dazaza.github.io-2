And to that end, the startup, which announced an undisclosed seven-figure seed last year, has finally closed the round at $5.3 million .\n VC firms 500 Global and Unicorn Growth Capital co-led the Lagos-based company\u2019s seed round . It saw participation from U.S.-based accelerator Expert Dojo, Predictive VC, SaaS Growth Ventures, Betatron Venture Group, Accelerex Holdings. Individual investors like Andrew Dell, former CEO of HSBC and Craig Fenton of Google UK also took part.\n  The company plans to use the investment to expand within its home market Nigeria \u2014 where it operates in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja \u2014 and outside to Ghana and Kenya. It also wants to improve its product offerings and add more staff.\n For years, store-like businesses in Nigeria such as supermarkets and restaurants have operated offline, relying on bookkeeping and head knowledge to record their customers\u2019 activities in their shops. This made it difficult to offer cash back and loyalty points to customers .\n Online platforms like ThankUCash present these merchants with an opportunity to delve into rewards and help them retain loyalty and increase revenue.\n CEO  Simeon Ononobi started ThankUCash with Suraj Supekar, Madonna Ononobi and Harshal Gandole, who act as a chief technical officer, chief operating officer and senior vice president of engineering,  respectively .\n  The multi-merchant rewards platform (which means customers can hop on from one merchant to another to earn loyalty points in another) allows customers to earn rewards anytime they shop with thousands of merchants listed on its app.\n The business raised a $320,000 pre-seed after grabbing the  attention of accelerators such as 500 Startups, Google Launchpad and other local investors like  Microtraction and  Ventures Platform.\n Up until this point, ThankUCash said it has recorded over 600,000 users and onboarded over 1,000 stores on its platform . Also, it claims to have processed over $80 million in transaction volume.\n Having matured as a business, Ononobi and his team want to take on a more complicated task: building infrastructure for companies that want to offer akin services.\n \u201cWe are creating solutions that help SMEs succeed while increasing consumer buying power and opportunities.  We want to build an infrastructure for rewards, loyalty, deals, buy now, pay later, cashback,\u201d he said to TechCrunch on a call .\n \u201cCashback was our low hanging fruit and an entry point. We\u2019re still going to go into deals, couponing, gift cards, buy now, pay later, anything that will help the business grow, but at the same time, allowing the consumer increase in opportunities of buying.\u201d\n Ononobi, a serial entrepreneur who previously built a payments company and also apps for Nigerian banks and the government, reckons that ThankUCash will do to rewards the same thing Flutterwave and Paystack did to payments in Africa.\n Some companies such as banks have launched cashback programs via debit cards to users in the past . But most of them have been generally inefficient, from setup down to collections and redeeming of points, and Ononobi argues that their inefficiencies boil down to no technical support.  ThankUCash sees a gold mine to provide plugins banks and fintechs can tap into to offer cashback and rewards .\n  The bit about buy now, pay later is fuzzy now since  only a handful of prominent BNPL services in Africa.  However , the company seems to be positioning itself for the imminent proliferation of such services buoyed by similar happenings globally where buy now, pay later services have seen an uptake as a result of pandemic-induced consumer behaviour.\n \u201cThe technology is such that we have our machines in stores.  So as customers request loans, we generate a code for it, customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited  directly . The code can only  be used  in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested, such that at the end of the day the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d explained the founder, who also mentioned that his startup might venture into offering buy now, pay later services itself in the future.\n ThankUCash\u2019s consumer-facing platform will remain operational. But to set the infrastructure play in motion, it has signed a partnership with payments company Interswitch to onboard its merchants.\n The company, which is also  in the process of  making integrations with payments gateways, said a couple of bank partnerships are in its pipeline.\n In terms of how ThankUCash makes money, merchants pay the company a fee on every  purchase  made in their stores.  For instance, ThankUCash gets a 1.5% commission for every customer it brings into the store to redeem a 5% cashback item.\u00a0 The Lagos-based company also takes commissions for deals and plans to charge a \u201cheavy onboarding fee\u201d for businesses that want to use its APIs for its services, including buy now, pay later.\n ThankUCash has perfected one offering: the cashback product where merchants can get more walk-in customers. It\u2019s improving the deals category, allowing merchants to sell products fast  (by hiring  ex-managers of DealDey, a Nigerian defunct deals company).  And while currently building out its buy now pay later infrastructure (which gives businesses a chance to sell products regardless of whether customers have money or not), ThankUCash plans to add a fourth offering soon: a remittance product where merchants can sell  directly  to the diaspora.\n The chief executive doesn\u2019t give details about this product. Meanwhile , its investors, who have doubled down while privy to information like this,  are enthused  about \u201cthe continued evolution of the company\u201d, a remark made by Amit Bhatti, the principal at co-lead investor 500 Global.\n \u201cSince going through 500 Global\u2019s accelerator in 2019, we\u2019ve  been impressed by  Simeon and the ThankUCash team\u2019s progress in implementing a rewards system that works for Nigerian consumers, regardless of cash or credit or online or offline payment,\u201d said the principal. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for businesses and banks, too, as TUC gives them the tools and data they need to grow.\u201d\n The 45-man team has hired Aaron Tindiseega to lead its expansion into Kenya and the eastern Africa region .  The Ugandan professional has experience working for banks and tech companies like Uber, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC . For its expansion into Ghana, Kiki Anku, who has worked at Apple and a couple of startups, will spearhead the task.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 16:33:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "chrenthucash,thankucash,\u5956\u52b1", "title": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684Chrenthucash\u786e\u4fdd5.3\u7c73\u4e3a\u73b0\u91d1\u8fd4\u8fd8\uff0c\u4f18\u60e0\u548cBNPL\u670d\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tNigeria\u2019s ThankUCash secures $5.3M to build infrastructure for cashback, deals and BNPL services\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5956\u52b1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ffc44112c6548ec442935518bfbb229f.jpg", "infoid": 1072596, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u80a1\u7968\u4e8e\u5468\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u20b91,226\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u8dcc5.3\uff05\u3002 PayTM\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u81ea\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u7565\u9ad84,150\uff0828.9\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u51fa\u7248\u65f6\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6982\u7387\u4e3a102\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e2019\u5e74\u5e95\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86\u878d\u8d44\u7684160\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u3002\n\u201c\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8c2d\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u5efa\u7b51\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u652f\u6301\u6027\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u3002\u5370\u5ea6\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u6e17\u900f\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6211\u4eec\u671f\u671b\u5f3a\u52b2\u589e\u957f\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u6570\u5b57\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u770b\u5230\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u52a0\u901f - \u8fd9\u5c06\u7531\u5370\u5ea6\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8def\u8f68\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u201c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5199\u516512\u670818\u65e5\u7ed9\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "note_en": "The stock, which opened Monday at \u20b91,226, dropped 5.3% at 1.55 pm India standard time. Paytm, which has been struggling to improve its stock price ever since its debut, has slid 45% from its issue price of \u20b92,150 ($28.9). The firm\u2019s market cap, at the time of publishing, was $10.2 billion, nearly half of what it had sought during the debut and below the $16 billion valuation at which it raised a financing round in late 2019.\n The plunge in price follows brokerage house Macquarie\u2019s report on Monday in which it retained its lowest rating on One97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, and cut its target price to \u20b9900 ($12.14), down from \u20b91,200 that it had assigned ahead of the market debut on November 18.\n  Macquarie was the only brokerage firm which had such a grim view on Paytm\u2019s outlook at the time of market debut. Analysts at Bernstein, in comparison, had estimated that Paytm valuation will range between $21 billion to $24 billion. (A Bernstein spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment in November.)\n \u201cPost the various business updates and results, we believe our revenue projections, particularly on the distribution side, is at risk and hence we pare down our revenue CAGR from 26% to 23% for FY21- 26E. We are roughly cutting revenue estimates for FY21-26E on an average by 10% every year due to lower distribution and commerce/cloud revenues offset partially by higher payment revenues,\u201d Macquarie analysts wrote Monday.\n \u201cWe cut our earnings (increase our loss projections) by 16-27% for FY22-25E owing to lower revenues and higher employee and software expenses. We cut our TP sharply by ~25% owing to lower target multiple of 11.5x (Price to Sales ratio) (from 13.5x earlier) and lower sales numbers. Maintain UP with a revised TP of Rs900.\u201d\n The brokerage firm said RBI\u2019s proposed digital payments regulations could cap wallet charges, which would hurt Paytm\u2019s business, where payments side still accounts for 70% of the firm\u2019s overall gross revenue. Macquarie also cited departure of senior Paytm executives and the shrinking ticket size for loans disbursed by Paytm as other factors that could impact the firm\u2019s future outlook.\n  In a report in the second half of December, analysts at Morgan Stanley labeled Paytm\u2019s stock as \u201coverweight,\u201d and assigned a target price of \u20b91,875 ($25.2), saying the firm was \u201cwell positioned to capitalize on upcoming acceleration in digital distribution of financial services/commerce in India.\u201d\n \u201cHuge TAM, India\u2019s distinctive tech architecture and regula- tory supportive partnership approach are key enablers, we believe. India is under-penetrated in financial services, and across segments we expect strong growth. More importantly, the penetration of third party digital distribution of financial services is significantly low and we will see strong acceleration over the next five years \u2013 this will be helped by the distinctive rails in India around identity, payments and data sharing,\u201d they wrote in a report to clients on December 18.\n \u201cAlso, we believe that PAYTM\u2019s cial services is synergistic, in line with the regulatory thought process and scalable. Balance sheet risk is low, and PAYTM\u2019s technology capabilities to leverage alternative data sets as well as design customized products are some key value adds against the above backdrop.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 16:33:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e93\u5b58,stock,\u5370\u5ea6", "title": "Paytm\u5e93\u5b58\u6ef4\u4e0b\u964d\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u4f4e", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPaytm stock drops to record low\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/paytm-stock-drops-to-record-low/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e93\u5b58", "stock", "\u5370\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "06af23f627f3a0ef10daa9352c723d19.jpeg", "infoid": 1072595, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Historian Amanda Foreman\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u4e86\u4eca\u5929\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u9605\u8bfb\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5217\u3002", "note_en": "Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today\u2019s world.

As it turns out, according to a  new article published in the journal  Bioacoustics, laughter has been \u201cdocumented in at least 65 species,\u201d Jessica Wolf  writes at UCLA Newsroom. \u201cThat list includes a variety of primates, domestic cows and dogs, foxes, seals, and mongooses, as well as three bird species, including parakeets and Australian magpies.\u201d This is a far cry from just a few years ago when apes and rats were the \u201conly known animals to get the giggles,\u201d as Liz Langley  wrote at\u00a0 National Geographic in 2015.\n Yes, rats laugh. How do scientists know this? They tickle them, of course, as you can see in the video just above. (Rat tickling, it turns out, is  good for the animals\u2019 well being.) The purpose of this experiment was to better understand human touch \u2014 and tickling,  says study author Michael Brecht, \u201cis one of the most poorly understood forms of touch.\u201d\n  Laughter, on the other hand, seems somewhat better understood, even among species separated from us by tens of millions of years of evolution. In their recent article,  UCLA primatologist Sasha Winkler and  UCLA professor of communication Greg Bryant describe how \u201cplay vocalizations\u201d signal non-aggression during roughhousing. As Winkler puts it:\n When we laugh, we are often providing information to others that we are having fun and also inviting others to join. Some scholars have suggested that this kind of vocal behavior is shared across many animals who play, and as such, laughter is our human version of an evolutionarily old vocal play signal.\n Generally, humans are unlikely to recognize animal laughter as such or even perceive it at all. \u201cOur review indicates that vocal play signals are usually inconspicuous,\u201d the authors write. Rats, for example, make \u201cultrasonic vocalizations\u201d beyond the range of human hearing. The play vocalizations of chimpanzees, on the other hand, are much more similar to human laughter, \u201calthough there are some differences,\u201d  Winkler notes in an interview. \u201cLike, they vocalize in both the in-breath and out breath.\u201d\n Why study animal laughter? Beyond the inherent interest of the topic \u2014 an especially joyful one for scientific researchers \u2014 there\u2019s the serious business of understanding how \u201chuman social complexity allowed laughter to evolve from a play-specific vocalization into a sophisticated pragmatic signal,\u201d as Winkler and Bryant write. We use laughter to signal all kinds of intentions, not all of them playful. But no matter how many uses humans find for the vocal signal, we can see in  this new review article how deeply non-aggressive play is embedded throughout the animal world and in our evolutionary history.

Those retailers can then sell those products to their own customers. It\u2019s a B2B2C play with a focus on offline sales at the end of the chain.\n You can find a bit of everything on Ankorstore, from household supplies to maple syrup, candles, headbands, bath salts and stationery items. Some verticals have been working quite well in particular, such as non-perishable groceries, beauty products and items for your home.\n  And it\u2019s been working extremely well given the company\u2019s trajectory. There are currently 200,000 retailers using the marketplace and sourcing items from 15,000 brands. In May 2021, when Ankorstore  raised its Series B, the company told me it was working with 50,000 shops and 5,000 brands.\n This leads us to today\u2019s funding round. Bond and Tiger Global led the Series C. Eurazeo and Coatue also participated in the round. Some existing investors put more money on the table, such as Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, GFC, Alven and Aglae Ventures.\n There aren\u2019t a lot of companies competing in the space. The best known wholesale marketplace is probably  Faire, a U.S.-based company that has raised  over $1 billion \u2014 it has recently started its  European expansion.  Creoate and  Orderchamp also operate wholesale marketplaces in Europe.\n   Ankorstore has teams in five countries \u2014 France, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. It sells products in 23 European markets. Retailers can pay up to 60 days after ordering something and there are no hidden fees for them. Essentially, Ankorstore helps retailers focus on curation, service while the startup takes care of procurement.\n As for brands listing their items on Ankorstore, they give a 10% cut on each transaction following a higher 20% cut on the first order through Ankorstore.\n Some brands still have direct deals with massive retailers, such as department stores. And Ankorstore doesn\u2019t prevent brands from hiring sales people, going to fairs, etc. The marketplace is just another sales channel and another opportunity to find customers.\n And this is the beauty of the business model of wholesale marketplaces. Ankorstore doesn\u2019t have any warehouse and doesn\u2019t own any inventory. The company only facilitates transactions between brands and retailers without any capital investment.\n \u201cWe think we\u2019re closer to LinkedIn in the way we operate \u2014 it\u2019s a network of professionals and we help them connect with each other,\u201d co-founder and co-CEO Nicolas Cohen told me.\n And like all social networks, there are some strong network effects as the platform gets bigger. In particular, Ankorstore expects to expand to new categories, such as perishable food.\n The startup already has a deal with UPS to help brands with shipping. But the company hasn\u2019t done much when it comes to warehousing solutions for small brands. That\u2019s another opportunity down the road.\n With 400 employees and a lot of money in its bank account, Ankorstore could act as the unifying layer of this highly fragmented industry.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 13:41:31", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u63a8\u51fa,reaches,\u9500\u552e", "title": "Ankorstore\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u6279\u53d1\u5e02\u573a\u540e\u4e24\u5e74\u8fbe\u523020\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAnkorstore reaches $2 billion valuation two years after launching its wholesale marketplace\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63a8\u51fa", "reaches", "\u9500\u552e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072592, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9ece\u660eBasciano\u7684\u7956\u5148\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u4e94\u4eba\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5974\u5f79\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u88ab\u8feb\u7559\u4e0b\u5a74\u513f\u513f\u5b50\u5974\u5f79\u5230\u5bc6\u82cf\u91cc\u5dde\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u975e\u5e38\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u57286\u6708\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8c01\uff1f\u201d\n\u5728\u5e9f\u9664\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u5230\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u7ea2\u7ebf\u5386\u53f2 \u200b\u200b- \u5426\u5b9a\u4e86\u5426\u8ba4\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u642c\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u5730\u533a - \u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6b67\u89c6\u4f4f\u623f\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5f53\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u9ed1\u4eba\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u9003\u5230\u4e86\u5357\u90e8\u548c\u5409\u59c6\u00b7\u4e4c\u9e26\uff0c\u5982\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u201c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u969c\u788d\u201d\uff0c\u5982\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u5951\u7ea6\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u623f\u4e3b\u5356\u7ed9\u9ed1\u4eba\u4eba\u4eec\u8bf4\uff0cIsabel Wilkerson\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u592a\u9633\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u53f2\u8bd7\u822c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u201c\u8d54\u507f\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\uff1f Basciano\u8bf4\uff0c\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u51e0\u4e4e\u611f\u5230\u5185\u759a\uff0c\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u6211\u6240\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u4e0e\u6211\u5171\u9e23\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u548c\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e86\u3002\u4f60\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1f\u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5982\u6b64\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1f\u201c", "note_en": "Dawn Basciano\u2019s ancestors arrived five generations ago in Coloma,  California, as enslaved people, forced to leave behind an infant son enslaved to another family in Missouri.\n Those ancestors, Nancy and Peter Gooch, were freed in 1850 when California joined the union as a free state, and 20 years later, their son and his family were able to join them in the fertile agricultural land north-east of Sacramento. Their journey west was funded by the sweat and hard work of Nancy, who grew and sold fruit, mended clothes and cooked for the local miners.\n  Nancy and her descendants would go on to purchase more than 400 lush acres of farmland in Coloma. But what should have been a story of triumph ended instead as a tale all too familiar to formerly enslaved Black Americans across the US. The state of California seized the majority of that land under the guise of eminent domain to build a state park, and the family never received just compensation.\n The economic injustices, the education injustices, the social injustices, the judicial injustices go on and on and on\n \u201cWe were denied the financial security and wealth associated with land ownership,\u201d Basciano said. Pearley Monroe \u2013 Nancy\u2019s grandson, and Basciano\u2019s great-grandfather \u2013 spent the rest of his life mourning the loss.\n Now, the story of Basciano\u2019s family and others are under review by a California reparations taskforce. The first of its kind in the nation, the committee is tackling the daunting and unprecedented work of recommending reparations \u2013 whether they be monetary or through policy \u2013 for Black Californians, particularly those who are descended from enslaved people.\n Shirley Weber, the California secretary of state, who authored the law that formed the taskforce, has said California must forge its own path on the thorny topic of reparations, an issue the federal government has  tried and  failed to resolve for decades.\n \u201cWe came to understand very clearly that California has the ability and the power to do it,\u201d she said at a public hearing in June. \u201cAnd if not us, then who?\u201d\n The taskforce was formed in 2020 after the legislature and Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, approved a law requiring  the study and development of reparations proposals. Since then, the nine-person taskforce, comprising civil rights leaders, attorneys, lawmakers and academics, has spent months gathering evidence, listening to expert testimony, hosting public meetings and considering proposals, with the goal of submitting its recommendations to the legislature next summer.\n  The taskforce is undertaking this vast challenge with the knowledge that the historic injustices suffered by the descendants of slavery are deep, systemic and difficult to quantify.\n \u201cThe economic injustices, the education injustices, the social injustices, the judicial injustices go on and on and on,\u201d said Weber in June. \u201cWe must be aggressive in our efforts to be honest and direct and to figure out what we need to do in California and be an example to the rest of the nation in how we begin to reckon with ourselves.\u201d\n  California\u2019s unique history with slavery and its aftermath has made addressing reparations a particularly complicated task.\n Though California joined the union as a free state in 1850, 11 years before the civil war, many who took to the Sierra Nevada foothills during the Gold Rush in the years before statehood brought enslaved people with them. While the state constitution proclaimed \u201cneither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for punishment of a crime, shall ever be tolerated\u201d, the legislature passed a fugitive slave law in 1852 that allowed those who had been brought to California before it became a free state to be returned to the south.\n In one case that went all the way to the state supreme court, a slaveholder brought a man, Archie Lee, to California after statehood and after the fugitive slave law had lapsed . But the courts argued that the slaveholder was so \u201cyoung and ignorant\u201d of California\u2019s laws that he should not be deprived of his human property, Stacey Smith, an associate history professor at Oregon State University, testified at a public taskforce meeting in September.\n  Other experts testified about the years of discrimination that followed after slavery was abolished, from environmental racism to the state\u2019s history of redlining \u2013 a discriminatory practice of denying financial services to specific people to prevent them from moving to or living in certain areas \u2013 and how discriminatory housing practices led to segregation in schools. They also testified about the Great Migration, when millions of Black Americans fled the south and Jim Crow to places like California, hoping for a better life, but found instead \u201cstructural barriers of exclusion\u201d like restrictive housing covenants that forbade homeowners from selling to Black people, said Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration.\n \u201cThe caste system followed the migrants wherever they went and became not merely a southern phenomenon, but a national one,\u201d she testified. Black Californians also faced rampant racism in the communities where they tried to settle. Wilkerson spoke of how after Emory Hestus Holmes, a second world war veteran, purchased a three-bedroom home for his family in Pacoima, California, in 1959, the neighbors led a relentless harassment campaign in an effort to get them to move away. They prank-called them at all hours, threw rocks through their windows, burned a cross on their lawn and spray-painted on their garage: \u201cBlack Cancer Lives Here, Don\u2019t Let It Spread\u201d.\n  Early on in the process, the taskforce reviewed other examples of reparations programs throughout the world. Germany paid $89bn in restitution to Holocaust victims while the United States paid $20,000 each to the 82,219 Japanese Americans who were unlawfully incarcerated during the second world war. In 2015, the United States authorized payments of up to $10,000 per day \u2013 a total of $4.4m each \u2013 for the dozens of people taken hostage in Iran in 1979. A Kirsten Mullen, co-author of From Here to Equality, told the taskforce that following that same math, the payment for one Black American who endured a single decade under Jim Crow would be $36.5m.\n But the challenge before this taskforce is that so many of the injustices suffered and opportunities lost by Black Americans \u201ccan\u2019t be quantified\u201d, Weber said at a September meeting.\n Weber\u2019s father was a sharecropper in Hope, Arkansas, who had to flee to California after he tried to organize for fairer wages. Descended from enslaved people, his community had been terrorized into deference following a number of race riots that ripped through the country. \u201cYou can\u2019t quantify my father\u2019s lack of education and the negative experience that he had just trying to survive for himself and his family,\u201d Weber said. \u201cYou have to begin to say, OK, what do we do in terms of opening up this particular society in a way that really makes an effort to create the opportunities not just for those who are here but also for the next generation to come?\n  The scale of the injustices under assessment by the committee is almost inconceivably vast. Given stolen land and housing discrimination alone, Black Americans were denied the greatest source of family wealth today \u2013 home ownership, Wilkerson testified. This robbery of family inheritance and generational wealth has created a wealth gap between Black and white Americans that  some studies say would take 228 years to close.\n  For Dawn Basciano\u2019s family, the loss was enormous. Not only did they lose the majority of their farmland on her paternal side \u2013 land that would have provided steady employment for extended family as well money and legacy \u2013 her fourth great-grandmother on her mother\u2019s side had assets unfairly taken from her as well when her brother died and the state auctioned off the swaths of property he owned in downtown Sacramento under the pretense that he had no living heirs or descendants \u2013 \u201calthough his sister, my fourth great-grandmother, was alive and well\u201d, Basciano testified in September.\n \u201cWhat do reparations look like? There is so much,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cI almost feel guilty for feeling the pain that I feel, but it\u2019s real. It resonates with me. This is my family. These are the stories that have been told and retold, and it hurts. How do you fix that? How do you right a wrong that is so systemic?\u201d\n Basciano pointed out that there were hundreds of thousands of families that had stories like hers. In September, Newsom signed a law that would return a lucrative beachfront property in Manhattan Beach, California, that had been taken from the  Bruce family in the 1920s through eminent domain.  The Manhattan Beach city council had voted to oppose issuing a symbolic proclamation to apologize to the Bruces, citing concerns it would make the city liable for future lawsuits.\n Though any recommendations made by the taskforce will not be binding, Weber urged its members to be bold in their proposals, including universal preschool for all children to help address educational and childcare inequities. Other witnesses and experts have suggested monetary reparations, low-interest loans, public apologies, just compensation for stolen land, the return of historically stolen land and ways for descendants of slavery to attend university at no cost.\n The taskforce will continue to meet in the new year. Weber acknowledged that whatever the body comes up with will probably only be the beginning.\n \u201cThis 400-year challenge is not going to be solved in 400 days,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIt will take much more than that, and a commitment from the state of California, the fifth-largest economy in the world, to make that happen.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 13:29:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u63a8\u52a8,push,\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a", "title": "'\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8c01\uff1f'\uff1a\u5730\u6807\u63a8\u52a8\u9ed1\u8272\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u4eba\u7684\u8d54\u507f", "title_en": "\u2018If not us, then who?\u2019: The landmark push for reparations for Black Californians", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/california-reparations-slavery-african-americans", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u63a8\u52a8", "push", "\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c3c4f7fcfdd0315b47d1f08722f70ca6.jpeg", "infoid": 1072591, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u9662\u8003\u8651\u5230\u62dc\u767b\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1 - \u5305\u62ec\u5468\u4e94\u7684\u53e3\u5934\u8bba\u636e\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662 - \u5df2\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6cd5\u4ee4\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5baa\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u636e\u8bf4\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\uff1aomicron\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\u3002", "note_en": "Federal courts considering the Biden administration\u2019s vaccination mandates\u2014including the Supreme Court at Friday\u2019s oral argument\u2014have focused on administrative-law issues.

I first saw the illusory nature of space when I was in high school. In the late forties I saw that causality was an illusion.\u201d\n This\u00a0is a reflective Philip K. Dick, writing in the last few years of his life, trying to put into words a social and metaphysical philosophy that had been haunting him for decades as he wrote dozens of science fiction stories that aimed to, as he said, \u201cpierce the veil of what is only apparently real to find out what is  really  real.\u201d The world was not real, everything was an illusion and everyday life was but a living dream.\n It\u2019s fitting that Berkeley \u2014 a city of artists and intellectuals and mechanics and squatters \u2014 was the place where the epiphany revealed itself to him; that Berkeley would become the locale of inspirational fodder for decades to come.\n His family moved to the city in 1931 when he was just 2. School records at the nursery he attended described Dick as \u201ca lover of peace,\u201d with an \u201cintellectual curiosity and keen interest in everything about him.\u201d\n This was, in part, a reflection of both his upbringing by his well-educated parents and his new home in a town with a large population of freethinking academics and bohemians attending UC Berkeley. Back then, a small trolley car used to run along Telegraph Avenue, flanked by small shops and restaurants that catered to the cosmopolitan tastes.\n More traditional forms of entertainment and leisure seemed to escape him, even at an early age: After watching a Cal football game at age 6, he later told his dad that he didn\u2019t understand why the players were constantly chasing each other back and forth across the field.\n Of course, Berkeley is more than just a university, and later in life, Dick would base many of his stories \u2014 science fiction and   otherwise  \u2014 in the blue-collar neighborhood of West Berkeley that was populated by warehouses, used car lots, greasy-spoon cafes and bars.\n As constant upheaval in his everyday life \u2014 Dick and his mother frequently moved from cottage to apartment around Berkeley\u00a0\u2014 began to take a toll on the young Berkeleian, he found solace in the stories and rhetoric of imaginary worlds.\n Dick would base many of his stories  in the blue-collar neighborhood of West Berkeley that was populated by warehouses, used car lots, greasy-spoon cafes and bars.\n He became obsessed with L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cOz\u201d  series and its tales of flying homes and evil witches and enchanted roads (though he later said as an adult that he struggled to find every book installment because \u201clibrarians haughtily told me that they \u2018did not stock fantastic material,\u2019 their reasoning being that books of fantasy led a child into a dreamworld and made it difficult for him to adjust properly to the \u2018real\u2019 world.\u201d)\n When Dick was 10, he and his dad paid 50 cents each to attend the 1939 World\u2019s Fair in San Francisco. In an   short film  promoting the event, an announcer proclaims how the city is straddled by \u201cthe two largest bridges in the world, symbolizing both pioneering vision and modern courage, in the conquest of space and time.\u201d As his father went to see a striptease performance, Dick wandered the fair\u2019s Hall of Science.\n  The next year, he took a crack at writing, his first attempt being a poem titled \u201cHe\u2019s Dead.\u201d The last two lines of the piece read, \u201cNo longer shall he scorn his bed. / Alas for us! Our dog is dead.\u201d The poem, along with several short stories, was published in the \u201cYoung Authors\u2019 Club\u201d section of the now-defunct local paper Berkeley Gazette. A mature Dick would go on to say that he considers the beginning of his writing career to be the same year he wrote the elegy to his late family dog.\n During this time, like most kids his age in Berkeley, he attended Garfield Junior High School, now known by its current name, Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School. But, like any good tortured artist, he hated the academic structure of public school with a passion. His health had never been particularly good (he was already taking amphetamines for his asthma), and constant bouts of panic attacks and vertigo made school almost unbearable.\n Often staying home from school, his discovery of his first science fiction magazine in 1940 unfurled the infinite opportunities of fantasy before him. Dick began to haunt various Berkeley secondhand bookstores, trying to get his hands on as many sci-fi pulps as possible. By the time he entered Berkeley High School four years later, \u201cthe battles were drawn,\u201d writes biographer Lawrence Sutin.\n Dick would need to take refuge in the realm of imaginative art or be swallowed whole by physical and psychological trauma of the real world.\n But back to that high school epiphany, that first glimpse of \u201cdivine madness.\u201d A student at Berkeley High School, still suffering from a debilitating combination of vertigo, agoraphobia and claustrophobia \u2014 he once, as he walked down the aisle of a classroom, said he felt as though the floor was tilting away from him, as if the whole world were shifting under him.\n During the middle of a high school physics final, he struggled to answer a question on Archimedes\u2019 principle, which states that when an object is submerged, it is met with a force equal to the volume of the water it has displaced. In an anxiety-fueled panic, the test seemed to be all that stood between him and entrance to UC Berkeley (the university that most of his friends were expected to attend).\n \u201cI prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and then this voice clicked on and said, \u2018The principle is really very simple,\u201d Dick later recalled in an interview. \u201cThen it went on and stated the principle and explained how it was applied.\u201d\n All the mental barriers that had plagued him through schooling suddenly melted away, with a mechanical \u201cclick\u201d and the guidance of an almost android-like entity. He got an A on the test.\n It was a revelation that would still follow him many years later: The technological female voice of artificial intelligence just beyond the event horizon of reality, weaving its way into published words and burrowing into his increasingly unstable mind, providing a dizzying clarity and obscurity.\n For a teen with as much social anxiety as Dick had, it\u2019s surprising that he ended up getting jobs at local radio and records shops in Berkeley at the tender age of 15. But Dick thrived in the seeder art community in Berkeley, debating and joking with his co-workers about politics and music and life.\n His first task at University Radio, then located near Shattuck Avenue and Center Street, was salvaging vacuum tubes and adapters for parts (World War II continued to rage in Dick\u2019s teen years). Dick sold radios and other appliances for the store and, later, a new form of technology called television.\n The store imparted more than work experience: He lost his virginity to a former customer of his in its basement storage closet. Interestingly enough, in his 1965 novel \u201cDr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb,\u201d a basement storage closet becomes the last place of refuge for a couple of TV store employees in Berkeley during a nuclear strike.\n \u201cBecause I was fortunate enough to live in Berkeley, which is probably as much an intellectual center as you\u2019d find anywhere in the world, I was not limited as my other friends who write science fiction are.\u201d\n As hard as it is to imagine now, Dick\u2019s love of science fiction and fantasy began to wane when he left his mother\u2019s home as a 19-year-old with no plan to go to college. An older Dick posited that it was because Berkeley culture of the 1940s \u201crequired you to have a really thorough groundbreaking in the classics.\u201d\n \u201cBecause I was fortunate enough to live in Berkeley, which is probably as much an intellectual center as you\u2019d find anywhere in the world, I was not limited as my other friends who write science fiction are,\u201d Dick   said .\n In a kind of parallel to the days of his childhood with his then-recently-divorced mother, Dick\u2019s early 20s were marked by constant moving: One year at McKinley Avenue, another Bancroft Way, another on Dwight Way. During this time, Dick struggled under his desire to write, a deeper desire to attain celebrity status and a desperate need to make money. He wrote dozens of mainstream short stories at the time. Editors didn\u2019t bite, and it stung.\n In 1949, he gave college one last try. At UC Berkeley, he majored in philosophy, taking classes in history and zoology. One year later, however, he quit. In a later interview, he described his exasperation with the whole institution of academia:\n \u201cI had a whole bunch of courses that were just so much birdshit. \u2026 I was standing there looking in the microscope. And there aren\u2019t even any paramecia in there at all, \u2018cause the slide moved. And the instruction is, \u2018draw what you see,\u2019 and I realize that there\u2019s nothing there, nothing at all.\u201d\n He would never return to school, but stated on several occasions the importance and value he placed in his UC Berkeley library card. It would be at UC Berkeley\u2019s very own Main Stacks that, in the coming decade, he would spend years looking up Gestapo documents and other Nazi propaganda, gathering research for a possible story about an alternative world where the Axis won World War II.\n In 1962, the years of writing and researching and soul-searching would culminate in the publication of the \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d a novel set in the shimmering, gritty and exotic city just across the bay. The novel received critical acclaim and put the short story writer on the map. The book won Dick a Hugo Award, the science fiction and fantasy literature world\u2019s highest award.\n  The whole story, though, of Dick\u2019s life after the end of his youthful years in Berkeley is just as dystopian as many of his works. For most of his life he was impoverished \u2014 In 1950, he bought a house on Francisco Street, but as the decade went on, he was still writing mostly short stories that didn\u2019t pay nearly enough. Dick and his then-wife would sometimes eat ground horse meat purchased at 35 cents a pound from the\u00a0Lucky Dog Pet Shop\u00a0in Berkeley. And, eventually, he would move away.\n The amphetamines he had started taking for his asthma as a child morphed into an addiction to speed that fueled the breakneck pace of his writing (he wrote three novels, \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u201d \u201cUbik\u201d and \u201cNick and the Glimmung,\u201d all in 1966) but also destroyed his body and mind. From that first consummation in the basement of University Radio, Dick had a procession of failed marriages and romances, almost always with a woman whose intelligence and seductive charm appeared to him both terrifyingly cold but deliriously irresistible.\n In 1974, Dick proclaimed that a pink light had appeared before him and\u00a0a benevolent being he nicknamed Zebra had zapped his brain with \u201cmystical information.\u201d Zebra, he said, was camouflage in the form of everyday objects, and had revealed to him that our history and present was an illusion.\n By the end of his life, the visionary of alternative worlds believed that his own world was a simulacrum of some unattainable reality. Dick would remain largely unknown to the mainstream public whose attention he had so desperately craved until just before his death in 1982, just a few months before the first release of a major film based on his work: \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d\n  He only ever saw glimpses of the film, but in a   letter  to the production company, Dick\u2019s excitement for the future is palpable: \u201cMy life and creative work are justified and completed by Blade Runner. Thank you, \u2026 and it is going to be one hell of a commercial success. It will prove invincible.\u201d\n Even with his larger-than-life narratives of space travel and technological advances and apocalyptic societies, Dick\u2019s works always seemed to present an uncanny valley version of everyday life \u2014 who\u2019s to say that goat in the Berkeley hills or that toad croaking at Strawberry Creek isn\u2019t  a machine?\n In fact, Berkeley\u2019s unique fingerprints on the sci-fi vanguard\u2019s work become obvious on closer inspection: the repairmen and tinkerers, the anxiety of a dilapidated urban cityscape, the lofty metaphysical philosophies of men long since dead, robot-life femmes fatales, and even a neighbor\u2019s dog. Every aspect of his life in Berkeley was rendered imaginative fodder for his creative tales. Everything was material.\n It makes sense, perhaps, that the first short story Dick ever sold in 1953 was entirely based on the utterly mundane situation of a Berkeley neighbor\u2019s dog barking at the garbage man. The story of \u201cRoog\u201d goes like this: A dog named Boris, who believes that garbage is actually precious food, is shocked to see that his owner not only tosses the garbage into cans, but that it is also dumped into garbage trucks. The twist? With his keen perception, Boris is able to sense that the garbage men are actually \u201cRoogs,\u201d predatory creatures disguised as humans that accept the garbage as sacrifices until they eventually tire of trash and devour the humans.\n Trying to alert the humans, Boris cries \u201cRoog! Roog!\u201d but they all mistake the alerts as simple barking, letting the garbagemen escape to prey another day.\n Kyle Arnold puts it best in his biography \u201cThe Divine Madness of Philip K.

It all seemed so promising. Amazon Pay would provide an easier checkout experience for my customers, with the shipping address and payment details already filled, and I\u2019d save a small amount in transaction fees. What could go wrong? But six weeks later, Amazon has $2300 of my money with no way for me to access it, and their support has been worthless. I can only hope that a public shaming article will spur somebody at Amazon to take notice and intervene, otherwise that money is probably just gone.\n I created the Amazon Pay account on November 29, and configured my business bank account info so I could receive electronic disbursements. This is a normal business checking account at a normal US bank, using US dollars, and that works fine with other payment processors like PayPal and Shopify Payments. I entered the bank\u2019s ACH routing number and my account number, which ends with the digits 622. Soon I was able to receive payments in my store using Amazon Pay, and everything seemed good.\n The problem started on December 8, when Amazon Pay attempted the first disbursement to my bank account. I received a failure notification by email:\n \u201cYour most recent transfer of funds in the amount of $XXX was not successfully deposited into your bank account on file (ending in 622). The funds were returned to us, and we have removed the current bank account information from your account.\u201d\n Amazon Pay\u2019s merchant support was unable to explain what went wrong. They sent me some generic troubleshooting info that looked like it was written by a bot. It\u2019s not clear why they couldn\u2019t provide any specific details about why this transfer failed. The generic info suggested the routing or bank account numbers might be wrong, so I re-entered the numbers again, being extra careful to get them correct. Then I waited a week\u2026 and the exact same thing happened. This same dance played out five more times on December 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21. Each time Amazon Pay attempted a disbursement to my bank, then a few days later I got the same email saying the money wasn\u2019t successfully deposited to my bank account ending in 622, and \u201cwe have removed the current bank account information from your account.\u201d\n On December 23 I contacted my bank and gave them the trace IDs for all the failed transfers. My bank determined that the account number was wrong on every transfer. All the failed ACH transfers used an account number ending in 62 instead of 622:  the last digit of the account number was missing!\n Armed with this information, I returned to Amazon Pay merchant support, and here\u2019s where I really started to get frustrated. I discovered that my original support case had been unilaterally closed without resolution, because five days had passed since the last reply, and apparently that\u2019s their support policy. It\u2019s not possible to reopen or reply to a closed case, so I had to create a new case and explain the issue all over again. This did not go well. Imagine this support exchange happening slowly by email over a series of two days:\n Me (paraphrasing):  I\u2019m still having trouble with disbursements. You closed my last case number XXXX about this issue, so I had to create this new case. My bank says the last digit of the bank account number is missing on all the ACH transfers from Amazon Pay, but the bank account number is correct in my Amazon Pay settings.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings.\n Me:  Please see attached screenshot showing my bank account info is already set up correctly. I have already done this several times, but every time there\u2019s a failed disbursement attempt, Amazon Pay removes my bank account information. The fundamental problem is that the last digit of the bank account number is missing in all of Amazon\u2019s ACH transfers. Please look at the ACH transfers yourself to confirm.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings. The screenshot you sent doesn\u2019t show what account it\u2019s associated with so we can\u2019t tell anything from that.\n Me:  The bank account info has already been entered. I\u2019ve attached a full-page screenshot showing this. The deposit method isn\u2019t assigned, because every time there\u2019s a failed disbursement attempt, Amazon Pay removes my bank account information. Please respond to the fundamental issue of the missing digit in the ACH transfers. Here are all the trace IDs again. You can verify them yourself.\n Amazon Pay:  Your bank account may not be compatible with our system. Your account needs to be ACH-ready. Please contact your bank.\n Me:  Yes it\u2019s ACH-ready, it\u2019s a standard business checking account at a USA bank, and I\u2019m already receiving ACH transfers there from PayPal and Shopify. I mentioned all this already in the first case that I opened, that Amazon Pay closed without resolution. You still have not addressed or even mentioned the fundamental problem that I\u2019ve asked about four times now, the missing digit in the ACH transfers. Kindly investigate why this digit is missing in all the ACH transfers from Amazon Pay.\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you are having problems with your bank account. Thank you for your continued patience. At this time I am working with our internal team to reach a resolution on your case.\n (five days later) Me:  Has there been any progress on this? I\u2019m still unable to access the funds in my Amazon Pay account.\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you are having problems with your bank account. Thank you for your continued patience. At this time I am working with our internal team to reach a resolution on your case.\n (five days later): Case closed with no further response from Amazon. Can\u2019t reopen or reply.\n Now I was really upset. Since I couldn\u2019t reopen the old cases, I opened a third case to explain the issue with failed disbursements and the missing account number digit, all over again.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings.\n  I was able to reach a phone support agent, and told him I just wanted to close my Amazon Pay account and get a final payout by paper check, since they seem unable to resolve the problem with electronic transfers to my bank.  I was told they can\u2019t do it. Basically the options were 1) electronic transfer to bank, or 2) electronic transfer to bank.\n I asked the phone agent to review the previous case, and see what information the \u201cinternal team\u201d had found before that case was closed. There was none. All the discussion from the previous case was essentially gone and worthless.\n So I went through all the same conversation again with the phone agent, arguing about why my bank account info wasn\u2019t set up in my Amazon Pay settings. I gamely played along while he had me delete my browser cookies and other irrelevant troubleshooting. Since closing the account didn\u2019t appear to be a viable option, I tried once again to delete and re-enter all my bank account info. The phone agent insisted that everything would be OK now that I\u2019d entered my bank account info, and I would receive a disbursement within the next few days. He didn\u2019t seem to understand or care that I\u2019d already been through this same loop several times before without success. Skeptical, I thanked him and hung up. I then received a follow-up email:\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you would like to know how you can see the transaction and how disbursements work for the Amazon Pay platform. If you want to find your transactions coming from Amazon Pay just remember to switch from \u201cAmazon.com\u201d to \u201cAmazon Pay (Production View)\u201d. You would be able to see that next to your Seller name and the USA flag where there is a scroll down. etc\u2026\n What the actual fuck?! What is this and how is it relevant in any way? Is Amazon Pay\u2019s merchant support even staffed by human beings, or is it all just chatbots and  GPT-3-driven natural language text generation? Amazon needs to understand that merchants have many choices for payment processing, including PayPal and traditional credit card processors, who have professional support staffs to respond to account problems in a timely and constructive way. Many people complain about PayPal, but at least PayPal\u2019s support team responds to me with useful and relevant information that answers my questions. After a month of trying, I\u2019ve failed to get anyone at Amazon Pay to even acknowledge my problem with the missing account number digit, let alone give me any constructive help. Their merchant support seems designed to frustrate merchants into simply giving up and going away. I\u2019ve lost $2300 thanks to Amazon Pay, with no further options for resolution. Meanwhile Amazon Pay has been removed from my store, and I will not be reactivating it.

Nationwide expansion will begin in the following weeks.\n Hertz will offer Tesla Model 3, assumedly Standard Ran  ge Plus, for $334/week with plans available in the near future that will lower the price to $299 or less. Insurance and maintenance are both included. Drivers will have to currently maintain a 4.7 star rating and have completed at least 150 trips to be eligible for the program.\n Uber and Hertz have partnered since 2016 to provide drivers with vehicle rental options. With this partnership, Hertz will kick off the program by providing up to 50,000 vehicles by 2023 exclusively to drivers. If successful, the program could expand to 150,000 Teslas during the next three years. Hertz pointed out that these ambitions could be affected by factors outside of its control, such as semiconductor chip shortages or other constraints.\n Uber CEO Dara Khosrowhshahi issued a statement to CNN at the time of release that he hopes drivers who rent Tesla\u2019s through Hertz will eventually end up buying them in an effort to accelerate Uber\u2019s sustainability efforts.\n Uber is additionally offering a $1-a-ride bonus of up to $4,000 per year for Uber drivers who rent a Tesla through Hertz. Less than 10% of Uber drivers currently rent a vehicle.\n The rollout will be completed in 2023, with up to 50,000 Tesla\u2019s available for rent to Uber drivers. These Tesla\u2019s will be taken out of the 100,000 total purchase commitment that Herz made earlier this week, which pushed Tesla to a one-trillion dollar valuation.\n  Uber\u2019s CEO is completely spot-on: once drivers experience a Tesla, which is the goal of this program, they won\u2019t want to go back to driving an internal-combustion engine vehicle. This won\u2019t be a difficult sell either, as a recently-conducted survey of 6,000 Uber drivers found that 47% of drivers want their next vehicle to be fully electric.\n We do have to ponder the economics, as for many this will be a way to trial a Tesla as a taxi without the necessary commitments. $334/week, with a goal of getting prices to $299/week with volume, may sound slightly expensive at its surface but nonetheless carries a number of benefits along with the lack of a commitment.\n It is currently possible to finance a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus with $0 down for $789/month, or lease it for $672/month. This is with a market-adjusted starting price of $43,990 \u2014 up $7,000 from February of this year. While both figures ultimately represent a lower cost, Hertz is including all insurance and maintenance. We\u2019d have to presume that mileage limits will be high, or nonexistent, as well. There is also a variable of whether Hertz plans to enable Full Self-Driving Capability at a cost of $10,000 per Tesla, although we would assume they aren\u2019t planning to do so.\n Long-term it absolutely does become more cost-effective to purchase a Tesla, as on the used market they hold value well even with extremely high miles. Rental fees of ~ $1200/month are a sunken cost, whereas there is added utility to financing a new or used Tesla which includes a potential to use the vehicle on Tesla\u2019s own autonomous taxi network once it\u2019s ready. It\u2019s also possible to sell it once it\u2019s no longer in commission.\n Model 3 already lends itself to being the perfect electric taxi, so making it more accessible for Uber drivers will lead to a big push towards sustainability as well as increased driver satisfaction.
