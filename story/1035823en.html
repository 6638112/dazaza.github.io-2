But its volatile leader is fighting multiple lawsuits that could complicate his ambitions.</p><p>这家市值40亿美元的金融科技初创公司正在努力进行IPO。但其动荡的领导人正在与可能使他的野心复杂化的多个诉讼作斗争。</p><p>  “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM,” writes Vishal Garg, the CEO of Better.com, in an email to employees obtained by  Forbes. “You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</p><p>  Better.com首席执行官Vishal Garg在写给《福布斯》（Forbes）获得的员工的电子邮件中写道：“嗨-唤醒更好的团队。” “你太慢了。您是一堆哑巴海豚，而…哑巴海豚被网钩住并被鲨鱼吃掉。所以停止它。停下来。立即停止。你让我难堪。”</p><p> In many ways, Garg, 42, is the archetypal tech CEO: brilliant, brash and mercurial. Though his outbursts have caused headaches for some staffers, and forced others to quit — according to interviews with 19 current and former employees — such concerns have been overshadowed by Garg’s success in building Better, a venture-backed online mortgage originator that just secured a $4 billion valuation.</p><p> 在许多方面，现年42岁的加尔格（Garg）是原型技术首席执行官：才华横溢，勇敢而善变。尽管他的突如其来为一些员工带来了头痛，并迫使其他人辞职（根据对19名现任和前雇员的采访），但Garg成功建立了由风险投资支持的在线抵押贷款发起人Better，并获得了4美元十亿美元的估值。</p><p> The New York-based company boasts a fix to the notoriously byzantine home lending process, with a product that offers pre-approval on a mortgage in minutes. Riding the coattails of a white-hot residential lending market brought on by low interest rates and Covid-19, Better has grown exponentially — with more than 2,000 employees hired since the start of the pandemic — and is on track to generate $800 million in revenue this year, according to The Information.</p><p> 这家位于纽约的公司以臭名昭著的拜占庭式房屋贷款流程而闻名，其产品可在数分钟内提供抵押的预先批准。乘着低利率和Covid-19带来的白热化的住宅贷款市场，Better取得了成倍的增长-自大流行开始以来已雇用了2,000多名员工，并有望创造8亿美元的收入根据信息，今年。</p><p>  In recent weeks, investors poured in another $200 million, securing Garg&#39;s place as one of the world’s buzziest fintech founders, even before news  broke that Better may go public next year. “All I can say is the future is coming,” Garg  said this summer, months after the company was included on the 2020  Forbes  Fintech 50 list.</p><p>  近几周来，投资者再次注资2亿美元，以确保Garg成为全球最繁华的金融科技创始人之一的地位，甚至在有消息称Better明年可能会公开上市之前也是如此。 “我只能说未来即将到来，”加格在今年夏天被列入2020年《福布斯》金融科技50强榜单后几个月说道。</p><p> But Better’s investors appear to be overlooking a whole lot more than Garg’s scorched-earth management style: Ongoing lawsuits accuse Garg or entities he controls of improper and even fraudulent activity at two prior business ventures, and of misappropriating “tens of millions of dollars.”</p><p>但是Better的投资者似乎远远超过了Garg的焦头烂额的管理风格：正在进行的诉讼指责Garg或他所控制的实体在先前的两家企业中从事不当甚至欺诈活动，并且挪用了“数千万美元”。</p><p> In fact, Goldman Sachs, which has invested in three of Better’s funding rounds, spent two years accusing entities controlled by Garg of “flagrant self-dealing.” The bank, which did not invest in the most recent funding round, quietly dropped its legal claims in October. Goldman declined to comment on its relationship with Better and Garg or why it dropped its claims, but presumably, it may see more upside from its stake in Better than what it might collect in court.</p><p> 实际上，已经投资了Better的三轮融资的高盛（Goldman Sachs）花了两年时间指责Garg控制的实体“公然的自我交易”。这家没有进行最新一轮融资的银行在10月份悄悄放弃了其法律要求。高盛拒绝评论其与Better和Garg的关系或为何放弃其主张，但据推测，从其持有的Better股份中获得的好处可能要多于其在法庭上收取的收益。</p><p> Other parties in that dispute, including PIMCO — one of the world’s largest money managers — are still pursuing claims against companies Garg controlled, alleging they siphoned off money owed to investors in a troubled multibillion dollar mortgage portfolio. Meanwhile, a separate group of investors tied to management of the portfolio filed a lawsuit in June accusing Garg and his associates of fraud — a claim that Garg&#39;s attorneys have asked the court to dismiss.</p><p> 这场纠纷的其他各方，包括全球最大的资金管理人之一的PIMCO，仍在对Garg所控制的公司提起诉讼，声称他们从陷入困境的数十亿美元抵押贷款组合中掠夺了欠投资者的钱。同时，与投资组合管理相关的另一组投资者在6月提起诉讼，指控加尔格（Garg）及其同伙欺诈行为-声称加尔格的律师已要求法院予以驳回。</p><p>  Yet another legal battle involving Garg has dragged on for the better part of a decade. His former business partner and college friend, Raza Khan, claims that Garg improperly moved $3 million from a software company the two men started to his personal bank accounts, and then used stolen technology to help build  Better. Garg denies those claims and is countersuing, in a dispute so bitter that during a deposition Garg threatened to burn his former friend alive.</p><p>  十年来，与加尔格（Garg）一起的另一场法律之战仍在继续。他的前商业伙伴和大学朋友拉扎·汗（Raza Khan）声称，加尔从两个人开办的软件公司中非法转移了300万美元到他的个人银行帐户，然后使用被盗的技术来帮助建设Better。 Garg否认了这些主张，并在一场激烈的争执中提出反诉，以至于Garg在一次证词中扬言要烧死他的前朋友。</p><p> Taken together, the litigation raises questions not only about Garg’s past business practices, but also about the origin of Better. He has previously said he launched the company in 2014 with money he saved for a deposit on a house. But one of the lawsuits claims that misappropriated funds were actually used to launch the mortgage fintech. The suit also claims that a venture capital firm where Garg is the founding partner made more than a dozen investments in other tech companies with that money. Patrick Lenihan, a spokesperson for Better, said, “We can’t comment on ongoing litigation, but we are confident that these accusations are baseless.”</p><p> 综上所述，该诉讼不仅引发关于Garg过去的商业惯例的问题，也引发了关于Better起源的质疑。他之前曾说过，他是用自己存的钱存于房屋中的钱在2014年成立的。但是其中一项诉讼声称，挪用的资金实际上是用来启动抵押金融科技的。该诉讼还声称，以盖格为创始合伙人的一家风险投资公司用这笔钱对其他科技公司进行了十多次投资。 Better发言人帕特里克·列尼汉（Patrick Lenihan）说：“我们无法对正在进行的诉讼发表评论，但我们相信这些指控是毫无根据的。”</p><p> “I don’t think that he is someone who has come to terms with what he’s done.”</p><p>“我不认为他是一个已经接受了他所做工作的人。”</p><p> Lenihan declined requests for an interview with Garg. In his written responses to questions from  Forbes, he stated: “Lawsuits are an unfortunate fact of life for successful startups and their CEOs.” He singled out Khan, whom he called a “very litigious former friend and business partner.”</p><p> Lenihan拒绝接受Garg的采访请求。在对《福布斯》问题的书面答复中，他说：“诉讼对于成功的初创企业及其首席执行官来说是不幸的事实。”他选择了汗（Khan），他称汗为“非常有争议的前朋友和商业伙伴”。</p><p> As for Garg’s management style, Lenihan said, “Vishal’s leadership record speaks for itself,’’ adding that the CEO is “unapologetic about our efforts to grow and adapt nimbly.”</p><p> 至于Garg的管理风格，Lenihan说：“ Vishal的领导才能不言而喻。”他补充说，首席执行官“对我们为适应和成长做出的努力毫不歉意。”</p><p>  With Better seemingly on track to shake up the home mortgage market, and closing in on rivals like Rocket Mortgage and LoanDepot, the stakes are high. Better  previously raised money in 2019 at a reported valuation above $600 million. Its new funding round and valuation puts Garg on track to becoming a billionaire.</p><p>  随着Better似乎有望撼动住房抵押贷款市场，并与Rocket Mortgage和LoanDepot等竞争对手结盟，其赌注很高。 Better此前曾在2019年进行过融资，据报道其估值超过6亿美元。新一轮的融资和估值使Garg有望成为亿万富翁。</p><p> “I think Vishal, [like] a lot of entrepreneurs out there, [is] so desirous of recognition,” says Khan, the former business partner, who was once so close to Garg he delivered a speech at his wedding. “I don’t think that he is someone who has come to terms with what he’s done.”</p><p> “我认为Vishal像很多企业家一样，都渴望得到认可，”前商业合伙人Khan说，他曾经与Garg如此亲密，在婚礼上发表了讲话。 “我不认为他是一个已经接受了他所做工作的人。”</p><p>   B orn in India, Garg moved with his family to Queens when he was seven. Early on, he displayed both intellect and entrepreneurialism. As a student at Manhattan’s academically competitive Stuyvesant High School, he bought CliffsNotes and books, and then sold them to students at a markup.</p><p>加尔（Garg）在印度出生，七岁时随家人移居皇后区。早期，他既展示了智力，又展示了企业家精神。在曼哈顿具有学术竞争力的Stuyvesant高中学习时，他购买了CliffsNotes和书籍，然后以加价的价格卖给了学生。</p><p> “My superpower, I think, I was good at math and good at, like, being able to spot an opportunity,” Garg  said in a podcast last year. Another high school venture, he told the interviewer, was buying clothes at thrift stores and reselling them for a profit on eBay. (A Better spokesperson, however, said that wasn’t true as eBay wasn’t founded until after Garg left high school.)</p><p> “我的超级大国，我认为我擅长数学，擅长发现机遇，”加格去年在播客中说。他告诉采访者，另一所高中的企业正在旧货店买衣服，然后在eBay上转售以获利。 （不过，更好的发言人说，事实并非如此，因为eBay直到Garg高中毕业后才成立。）</p><p> At Stuyvesant, Garg met Khan, another immigrant from India, and in 1995, both enrolled at New York University; Garg studied finance and international business, while Khan got hooked on computer programming through a side job.</p><p> 在斯图韦森特（Stuyvesant），加尔格（Garg）遇见了另一位印度移民可汗（Khan），并于1995年入读纽约大学。加尔格（Garg）学习金融和国际业务，可汗（Khan）通过兼职从事计算机编程。</p><p> Merging Khan’s tech smarts, and Garg’s business acumen, they launched a company in 2000 that grew into MyRichUncle, an online student loan provider that used algorithms to help decide borrowing terms for students. The business started with a $30,000 investment from Khan’s brother, and by 2007 it had grown into a publicly traded company that originated $320 million in loans, making it one of the largest private student loan providers in the country.</p><p> 他们合并了Khan的技术智慧人物和Garg的商业敏锐度，于2000年成立了一家公司，后来发展成为MyRichUncle，这是一个在线学生贷款提供商，使用算法来帮助确定学生的借贷条件。该业务最初是由Khan的兄弟投资30,000美元开始的，到2007年，它已成长为一家上市公司，提供了3.2亿美元的贷款，使其成为该国最大的私人学生贷款提供商之一。</p><p> Khan says he was drawn to Garg’s ambition, and recalls spending nights discussing philosophy with him at tea houses on the Lower East Side. Though they were close friends, he says their philosophies didn’t always align. “People lie all the time, we should do it more often,” Khan remembers Garg saying in 2001. “I thought he was kidding. But I think part of him, in every joke there may be a little bit of truth.&#34;</p><p> Khan说他对Garg的抱负着迷，并回想起他在下东区的茶馆里整夜与他讨论哲学。他说，尽管他们是好朋友，但他们的理念并不总是一致的。 Khan回忆起2001年Garg说：“人们一直在撒谎，我们应该更经常这样做。我以为他在开玩笑。但我认为他的一部分，在每个笑话中可能都有一点道理。”</p><p> A spokesperson for Garg says that “a comment made nearly 20 years ago hardly seems relevant.”</p><p>Garg的发言人说：“将近20年前发表的评论似乎并不相关。”</p><p>    J ust as the stars seemed to be aligning for the two young entrepreneurs, the financial crisis and Great Recession hit. MyRichUncle couldn’t get the financing it needed to continue making loans and was forced into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation in 2009.</p><p>    就像明星们似乎正在适应两位年轻企业家一样，金融危机和大萧条袭来了。 MyRichUncle无法获得继续发放贷款所需的资金，因此在2009年被迫进行第7章破产清算。</p><p> But in a crisis driven by subprime mortgages, the pair spotted an opportunity. By building on software models developed at MyRichUncle, they believed they could analyze mortgage portfolios and identify loans that were wrongly made — for example, a borrower never had the means to pay off their loan, or the home appraisal was grossly inflated. In those cases, investors could sue the banks that had issued and sold the bad loans, potentially recouping some of their losses.</p><p> 但是在次贷推动的危机中，两人发现了机会。他们相信，通过利用MyRichUncle开发的软件模型，他们可以分析抵押贷款资产组合并识别出不良贷款-例如，借款人永远没有能力还清贷款，或者房屋评估被严重夸大。在这种情况下，投资者可以起诉已经发行和出售不良贷款的银行，有可能弥补部分损失。</p><p>  While the new venture, called EIFC, appeared promising when it launched in 2009, Khan says he began to see signs that the company’s finances — which were overseen by Garg — were not adding up. In 2013, he filed a lawsuit claiming that Garg hadn’t been filing the company’s taxes and that he had improperly moved $3 million to his personal bank accounts.</p><p>  可汗说，虽然这家名为EIFC的新公司在2009年启动时看起来很有希望，但他开始看到有迹象表明，该公司的财务（由加尔（Garg）监督）并未增加。 2013年，他提起诉讼，声称加尔格（Garg）尚未提交公司的税款，并且他不当地将300万美元转移到了他的个人银行帐户中。</p><p> Their falling-out has devolved into a legal mess, and the one-time friends now only see each other in court. Khan claims the technology he built at EIFC was stolen by Garg’s associates and used as part of Better’s software. Garg has denied he stole money or technology from EIFC and instead claims in court filings that Khan mismanaged the business and stole $400,000, allegations that Khan denies.</p><p> 他们的堕落已演变为法律混乱，而且曾经的朋友现在只能在法庭上见到对方。 Khan声称，他在EIFC上建立的技术已被Garg的员工窃取，并用作Better软件的一部分。 Garg否认他从EIFC中窃取了金钱或技术，而是在法庭文件中声称Khan经营不当并窃取了40万美元，这些指控均被Khan否认。</p><p> The dispute has been ugly. According to court documents, during a deposition in December, Garg turned to Khan and said that he was “going to staple him against a fucking wall and burn him alive.” (Garg later apologized during the session for letting his “emotions run out of control.”)</p><p>纠纷一直很丑。根据法庭文件，在12月的一次证词中，加尔格转向可汗，说他“打算把他钉在他妈的墙上，把他活活烧死。” （Garg后来在会议期间道歉，以让他的“情绪失控”。）</p><p>   I t’s not just Garg’s college friend who has turned against him. In 2011, an asset manager named Thomas Priore was battling fraud allegations from the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission and was looking to offload his company, which earned fees from managing a debt portfolio consisting of nearly 200,000 residential mortgages — many of which were failing.</p><p>   我不只是反对加格的大学朋友。 2011年，一位名叫Thomas Priore的资产管理人正在与美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的欺诈指控作斗争，并希望将其公司出售。该公司通过管理由近200,000份住房抵押贷款组成的债务投资组合而赚取了费用-其中许多失败了。</p><p> Garg saw a potential jackpot opportunity for EIFC. He lined up a group of investors to take over Priore’s firm for about $5 million using a series of companies set up in the Cayman Islands. (Priore later settled with the SEC for $23 million without admitting or denying the agency’s claims that he mismanaged the portfolio).</p><p> Garg看到了EIFC的潜在中奖机会。他召集了一群投资者，以开曼群岛成立的一系列公司，以约500万美元的价格收购了Priore的公司。 （Priore后来以2300万美元的价格与SEC达成和解，但并未承认或否认该机构声称他对投资组合管理不当）。</p><p> Part of the strategy was to use EIFC’s software to identify toxic mortgages, then glean huge settlements from the banks that issued them. Once existing debtholders in the portfolio were paid back, Garg and the investment group could pocket the leftover money — about $180 million, according to one estimate outlined in a pitch deck to investors.</p><p> 该策略的一部分是使用EIFC的软件来识别有毒抵押，然后从发行它们的银行那里收集大量的结算。一旦偿还了投资组合中的现有债务持有人，Garg和该投资集团便可以将剩余的资金-约一亿八千万美元-据一份推销给投资者的概算概述。</p><p>  Instead, major debtholders, such as Goldman Sachs and global investment giant PIMCO, and then the Cayman Islands investors, would allege they were the victims of what amounted to an elaborate deception.</p><p>  取而代之的是，高盛和全球投资巨头PIMCO等主要债务持有人，然后是开曼群岛的投资者，声称他们是精心策划的骗局的受害者。</p><p> It started when ongoing payments to the Cayman Islands investment group suddenly dried up in 2014, and they began demanding to see additional financial records. Then, through separate litigation, debtholders made a potentially explosive discovery: Garg appeared to control “side funds” that had received undisclosed money.</p><p>当开曼群岛投资集团的持续付款在2014年突然枯竭时，就开始了，他们开始要求查看其他财务记录。然后，通过单独的诉讼，债务持有人发现了一个潜在的爆炸性发现：加尔格似乎控制了收到未公开资金的“附带资金”。</p><p> According to the trustee representing the debtholders, an entity controlled by Garg had secured toxic-loan settlements from banks. Instead of being used to first pay off the debtholders, and then the investment group, some of the money went to undisclosed accounts Garg controlled, the trustee alleged. Goldman Sachs joined the case alongside PIMCO and echoed the claims, and said some of the practices by entities Garg controlled amounted to “flagrant self-dealing to enrich its owners.”</p><p> 根据代表债务持有人的受托人的说法，由Garg控制的一个实体已从银行获得有毒贷款清算。受托人称，其中一些钱没有被用来先还清债务人，然后是投资集团的钱，而是流向了由加格控制的未公开账户。高盛（Goldman Sachs）与PIMCO一起加入了该案，并回应了这一主​​张。他说，Garg所控制的实体的某些做法相当于“公然自私以充实其所有者。”</p><p> The total sum that Garg&#39;s companies allegedly did not disclose to debtholders remains unclear, though filings in the ongoing case peg the figure in the “tens of millions of dollars.”</p><p> Garg的公司据称没有向债务持有人披露的总金额仍不清楚，尽管在此案中的备案将这一数字定为“数千万美元”。</p><p>  Goldman and PIMCO declined to comment. A spokesperson for Garg said there “is no reason to comment” because Garg was not named as a defendant in the case. (Notably, Garg is repeatedly identified in court filings as being in control of two entities named as defendants; SEC filings from this past March show he still controlled them at that point. Attorneys for those entities have denied wrongdoing and claim they are actually owed money.)</p><p>  高盛和PIMCO拒绝置评。 Garg的发言人表示，“没有理由发表评论”，因为Garg没有在此案中被指定为被告。 （值得注意的是，Garg在法庭文件中一再被发现控制着两个被告人;美国证券交易委员会（SEC）从今年三月起的文件显示，他当时仍在控制他们。 ）</p><p> Members of the Cayman Islands investment group, meanwhile, allege that they were not told about at least $100 million in settlement money, a portion of which they claim to be entitled to. They filed a lawsuit in June accusing Garg and his associates of fraud, withholding payments and creating shell companies that cut them out of ongoing fees. (Attorneys for Garg have asked the court to dismiss the claims.)</p><p> 同时，开曼群岛投资集团的成员称，他们没有被告知至少有1亿美元的和解金，他们声称有权获得其中的一部分。他们在6月提起诉讼，指控加格及其同伙欺诈，扣留款项并创建空壳公司以免除其持续的费用。 （Garg的律师已要求法院驳回索赔。）</p><p> That lawsuit also raises questions about the source of Garg’s wealth. The Cayman Islands investors claim their money was withheld just as Garg began making investments through a venture capital firm he founded called 1/0 Capital. Since 2014, 1/0 has poured money into more than a dozen fintech start-ups, including the student lender Climb Credit and Jiko, a banking platform.</p><p>该诉讼还引发了有关Garg财富来源的疑问。开曼群岛的投资者声称他们的钱被扣留，就像Garg开始通过他成立的一家名为1/0 Capital的风险投资公司进行投资一样。自2014年以来，1/0已向十多家金融科技初创公司投入资金，其中包括学生贷款人Climb Credit和银行平台Jiko。</p><p> The first of 1/0’s investments, according to the suit: A new company called Better.com.</p><p> 诉讼显示，1/0的第一笔投资是：一家名为Better.com的新公司。</p><p>   A s Garg tells it, Better’s origin story sounds a lot more wholesome, even inspiring. He says he launched the business in 2014 after a failed attempt to buy a home. &#34;My wife was pregnant with our second child and we were still renting,” he  told  Forbes  last year. “We ended up losing a place that we wanted to buy to an all-cash buyer, because our mortgage process was so long and inefficient.”</p><p>   s Garg告诉我们，Better的血统故事听起来更有益健康，甚至鼓舞人心。他说，在尝试购买房屋失败后，他于2014年启动了这项业务。他去年告诉《福布斯》：“我的妻子怀了我们的第二个孩子，我们仍在租房。我们最终失去了一个我们想买给全现金买家的地方，因为我们的抵押流程如此漫长且效率低下。 。”</p><p> The concept was appealing: Better would compress the lengthy mortgage process and offer “pre-approval on your mobile phone in about 3 minutes,” using algorithms and third-party data. It would also forgo traditional borrower-paid fees, making it cheaper than many competitors. Once issued, Better would sell the mortgages to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, banks like Wells Fargo and other investors. It now earns most of its revenue from those buyers — up to about $10,000 per mortgage, former employees estimate.</p><p> 这个概念很吸引人：Better可以压缩冗长的抵押流程，并使用算法和第三方数据“在大约3分钟内在您的手机上提供预先批准”。它还将放弃传统的借款人支付的费用，使其比许多竞争对手便宜。一旦发行，Better会将抵押贷款卖给房利美，房地美，富国银行等银行和其他投资者。前雇员估计，它现在从这些买家那里赚取了大部分收入，每个抵押贷款最高可获得约10,000美元。</p><p>  Better’s product was a hit with consumers, thanks in part to aggressive marketing and, later, partnerships with the likes of Airbnb and Ally Financial. With such momentum, investors lined up to write checks for the business. Garg closed on a $30 million Series A round in 2016, and then raised another round at a $220 million valuation the next year.</p><p>  Better的产品深受消费者欢迎，这在一定程度上要归功于积极的营销以及后来与Airbnb和Ally Financial之类的合作伙伴关系。有了这样的势头，投资者排队为公司签发支票。 Garg在2016年完成了3000万美元的A轮融资，然后在第二年以2.2亿美元的估值进行了另一轮融资。</p><p> But even as the company notched a $600 million valuation, and then $4 billion, some employees say Garg created a harsh environment with behavior that ranged from belittling staffers who he saw as underperforming to berating managers whose workers only clocked eight-hour days. “If you are not interested in working hard,” he wrote in a Slack channel, “you need to find another place to show up everyday.”</p><p>但是，即使公司估值达到6亿美元，然后又是40亿美元，一些员工表示，加尔格创造了一个严酷的环境，其行为举止包括他认为表现不佳的轻浮员工到rating贬不一的经理，而这些经理的员工仅工作八小时。他在Slack频道中写道：“如果您对努力工作不感兴趣，那么您就需要每天另找一个地方露面。”</p><p>   D espite the legal cloud following Garg, key investors appear to be sticking by him, and Better. In October, soon after news broke that Better was negotiating a new funding round, Steve Sarracino, an investor and board member, received an email on behalf of one of the plaintiffs suing Garg.</p><p>   尽管加尔格（Garg）之后法律云层密布，但主要投资者似乎仍在他身边，而且更好。 10月，在有消息称Better正在进行谈判新一轮融资的消息传出后不久，投资者兼董事会成员Steve Sarracino收到了代表原告之一起诉Garg的电子邮件。</p><p> “You may be interested to know that Mr Garg is currently the defendant in numerous cases,” the email stated, before asserting that more than $100 million had gone missing from companies Garg controlled. It added that Garg had allegedly threatened to “burn alive” his former business partner.</p><p> 电子邮件中说：“您可能想知道Garg先生目前是许多案件的被告，”在断言Garg控制的公司损失了超过1亿美元之前，该电子邮件说。它补充说，据称Garg威胁要“烧死”他的前商业伙伴。</p><p> While Sarracino shared the email with Better’s board, the sender received a response from a lawyer at Garg’s venture capital firm, asking what he was “seeking to accomplish here.” Sarracino’s venture capital firm Activant joined American Express, Ally Financial and others in the recent funding round.</p><p> 当Sarracino与Better董事会共享电子邮件时，发件人收到了Garg风险投资公司的律师的回应，询问他“在这里想要完成什么”。 Sarracino的风险投资公司Activant在最近的一轮融资中加入了American Express，Ally Financial和其他公司。</p><p> Better’s success may explain the investors’ loyalty, at least for the moment: With the public markets in sight, the company says that it is currently profitable and has customers in more than 40 states.</p><p> 更好的成功至少可以在目前程度上解释投资者的忠诚度：随着公开市场的到来，该公司表示，该公司目前处于盈利状态，在40多个州拥有客户。</p><p> And Garg is keeping the pressure on. In September, a Better executive sent an email congratulating his team on a positive quarter. “Happy Friday!” the executive wrote. “We’ve helped save our customers collectively millions.”</p><p>Garg继续施加压力。在9月，一位Better主管发送了一封电子邮件，祝贺他的团队表现良好。 “星期五快乐！”行政人员写道。 “我们帮助我们的客户总共节省了数百万美元。”</p><p> Garg wasn’t impressed, declaring that the customer experience was still lacking and that his employees weren’t pressing a title insurance partner hard enough. “You need to press your [partner] to the point of breaking, then break them. Break them,” he responded. “Pls share the aggressive ‘I am going to break you’ tactics.”</p><p> Garg并没有留下深刻的印象，他宣称仍然缺乏客户体验，并且他的员工没有足够地向产权保险合作伙伴施加压力。 “您需要按[合作伙伴]的位置，然后将其断开。打破他们，”他回答。 “请分享激进的‘我要打破你的战术’。”</p><p> Then Garg sent a follow-up: “Punish them. Punish them like they just stole candy from your little sister. And until you fight for the consumer, you aren’t getting my love.”</p><p> 然后，加尔格（Garg）发送了一封后续邮件：“惩罚他们。惩罚他们，就像他们从您妹妹那里偷走了糖果一样。而且，除非您为消费者而战，否则您不会得到我的爱。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/执行官/">#执行官</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/vishal/">#vishal</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/garg/">#garg</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
