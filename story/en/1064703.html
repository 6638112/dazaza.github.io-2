This idea is sometimes referred to as “unskilled intuition” — I might have a strong  feeling that the guy fixing my car is trying to rip me off, but since I can barely understand the terms he is using to describe my steering-wheel issue, I’m really just feeling around in the dark. I’m a professional writer, not a mechanic.</p><p> 问题是，即使它们是相当合格的，在特定地区未经训练的人难以评估该领域的索赔是困难的。这个想法有时被称为“不熟练的直觉” - 我可能有一个强烈的感觉，这个人修复了我的车试图扯掉我，但由于我几乎无法理解他使用的术语来描述我的转向轮问题，我真的只是在黑暗中感到含糊。我是一个专业的作家，而不是机械师。</p><p> Few areas of behavioral science better exemplify the danger of unskilled intuition than the increasingly popular endeavor of positive psychology, one of the newest established subfields of psychology and one that has successfully sold questionable theories to many institutions, most notably the U.S. Army, for very large sums.</p><p> 少数行为科学领域更好地举例说明了不熟练的直觉的危险，而不是越来越受到的积极心理学的努力，这是一个最新的心理学和一体地为许多机构成功地将可疑的理论销售到美国军队，非常大总和。</p><p>  Positive psychology was founded by Martin Seligman, a legendary researcher at the University of Pennsylvania (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi also played a key role and co-wrote a pathbreaking 2000 article with Seligman). Marty, as he is known to everyone in his orbit, is an iconic, divisive figure in the world of academic psychology. If you looked only at the early part of his career, you’d be surprised that he ended up being one of the godfathers of a field dedicated to positivity. That early work was, well, dark. Through experiments that involved shocking dogs in different ways, Seligman developed the extremely important psychological concept of learned helplessness. It refers to a situation in which an organism’s lack of control over its surroundings prompts it to stop engaging in standard acts of self-preservation.</p><p>  积极心理学由宾夕法尼亚大学的传奇研究员（Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi）的传奇研究员成立了阳性心理学，也发挥了关键作用，并共同用Seligman划分了一个疏忽的2000文章）。马蒂，因为他对他的轨道上的每个人都知道，是一个在学术心理学世界中的标志性的分裂形象。如果你只在他职业生涯的早期看，你会感到惊讶，他最终成为一个致力于积极性的领域的一个神父之一。早期的工作是，很黑暗。通过以不同方式涉及令人震惊的狗的实验，Seligman开展了学习无助的极其重要的心理概念。它是指有机体对其周围环境缺乏控制的情况促使它停止从事标准的自我保存行为。</p><p> But later in his career, Seligman shifted focus dramatically. He came to realize, as he would explain in many speeches and interviews, that psychology was too focused on pathology, on fixing broken people, and less on cultivating strengths and helping people who were otherwise basically healthy to maximize their potential. Seligman wanted to transform American psychology, and the best way to do that would be as president of its flagship organization, the American Psychological Association. Seligman was elected in 1996 — “by the largest vote in modern history,” his faculty page notes — and when he took office in 1998, he made positive psychology the theme of his presidency.</p><p> 但后来在他的职业生涯中，Seligman急剧转移了焦点。他来实现了，因为他将在许多演讲和访谈中解释，这种心理学过于专注于病理学，在修复破碎的人身上，而且少于培养优势，帮助那些基本上健康的人来最大化他们的潜力。塞利格曼希望改变美国心理学，以及作为其旗舰组织，美国心理学协会的总统的最佳方式。 Seligman was elected in 1996 — “by the largest vote in modern history,” his faculty page notes — and when he took office in 1998, he made positive psychology the theme of his presidency.</p><p> This new, highly marketable subfield arrived at an important juncture for the broader discipline of psychology. As Barbara Ehrenreich explained in her 2009 critique of the positive-thinking movement,  Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America:</p><p> 这款新的高度贸易的子场地抵达了更广泛的心理学学科的重要关键。正如Barbara Ehrenreich在她的2009年的积极思考运动中解释的那样：明亮的思想：积极思维的无情促销已经破坏了美国：</p><p>  Positive psychology provided a solution to the mundane problems of the psychology profession. Effective antidepressants had become available at the end of the 1980s, and these could be prescribed by a primary care physician after a ten-minute diagnostic interview, so what was left for a psychologist to do? In the 1990s, managed care providers and insurance companies turned against traditional psychotherapy, effectively defunding those practitioners who offered lengthy courses of talk therapy. The Michigan Psychological Association declared psychology “a profession at risk” and a California psychologist told the San Francisco Chronicle  that “because of managed care, many clinical psychologists aren’t being allowed to treat clients as they believe they should. They still want to work in the field of helping people, so they’re moving out of therapy into coaching.” If there was no support for treating the sick, there were endless possibilities in coaching ordinary well people in the direction of greater happiness, optimism, and personal success.</p><p>  积极心理学为心理学职业的平凡问题提供了解决方案。有效的抗抑郁药在20世纪80年代末已有可用，并且在十分钟的诊断面试后，这些可能由初级保健医师开展，所以留给了心理学家的事项？在20世纪90年代，管理护理提供商和保险公司转向传统的心理治疗，有效地揭示那些提供漫长的谈话疗法课程的从业者。密歇根心理协会宣布心理学“风险职业”和加州心理学家告诉旧金山纪事称“由于管理护理，许多临床心理学家并不被允许在他们相信他们时对待客户。他们仍然想在帮助人们的领域工作，所以他们正在脱离治疗队。“如果没有支持治疗病人，那么在更大的幸福，乐观和个人成功方向教练普通井人们就有无穷无尽的可能性。 </p><p> In this view, positive psychology enabled professional psychology to greatly expand its market, allowing psychologists to advertise themselves as coaches to companies, schools, and other organizations.</p><p>在这种观点中，积极的心理学使专业心理学能够大大扩大其市场，允许心理学家向公司，学校和其他组织的教练宣传自己。</p><p> At root, positive psychology claims that there are reliable ways to make people happier and more optimistic and that these changes bring with them benefits like increased mental health and longevity. But the underlying science is controversial. As Daniel Horowitz writes in his excellent 2018 cultural and scientific history of the field,  Happier? The History of a Cultural Movement That Aspired to Transform America, “Virtually every finding of positive psychology under consideration remains contested, by both insiders and outsiders ... Major conclusions have been challenged, modified, or even abandoned.”</p><p> 在根本上，积极的心理学声称，有可靠的方法使人们更快乐，更乐观，这些变化带来了他们的好处，如脑内健康和长寿。但基础科学是争议的。正如Daniel Horowitz在他的优秀2018年文化和科学史上写的那样，更快乐？渴望改变美国的文化运动的历史，“几乎每次发现正在考虑的积极心理仍然遭到争议，主体和外人都有争议......主要的结论受到挑战，修改甚至被遗弃的。”</p><p> In a highly cited 2005 article, for example, the positive psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky and her colleagues argued that 50 percent of the variance in human happiness is accounted for by genetics, 10 percent by circumstance, and 40 percent by factors within individuals’ control, the result of choices they make. This encouraging “happiness pie” concept went viral, leading to book contracts, speaking engagements, and other professional rewards for Lyubomirsky. Seligman transformed it into a “happiness formula” in his own work:  H =  S +  C +  V. That is, happiness,  H, equals  S (genetic set point) plus  C (circumstances) plus  V (things under the individual’s voluntary control). In part on the basis of Lyubomirsky’s finding, he argued that there was a great deal of potential for the average person to become significantly happier.</p><p> 例如，在2005年度的2005年文章中，积极的心理学家Sonja Lyubomirsky和她的同事们认为人类幸福的50％的遗传因个人控制中的遗传造成了10％的遗传，10％，占个人控制中的因素为40％。选择的结果。这鼓励“幸福派”概念来了病毒，导致预订合同，发言参与和Lyubomirsky的其他专业奖励。 Seligman在自己的工作中转变为“幸福公式”：H = S + C + V.即幸福，H，等于S（遗传设定点）加c（情况）加v（个人自愿控制下的事物）。部分基于Lyubomirsky的发现，他认为普通人有很大的潜力，以越来越快乐。</p><p>  Remarkably, it appears to have taken almost a decade and a half for anyone to critically evaluate Lyubomirsky’s sunny claim in a peer-reviewed journal. But when Nicholas J.L. Brown and Julia M. Rohrer did, for an April 2020 article published in the  Journal of Happiness Studies, they found many statistical problems. Among others, “there is only very limited evidence to place the figure for the heritability of well-being as low as (precisely) 50%. Consequently, there is little reason to believe that 40% is a reliable estimate of the variance in chronic happiness attributable to intentional activity — for example, if Lyubomirsky et al. had chosen a different (but, in our view, at least equally plausible) set of estimates, they might just as easily have concluded that as little as [5 percent] of variance in chronic happiness can be attributed to volitional activities.” Suffice it to say that there is a massive difference between 5 percent and 40 percent of an individual’s level of happiness being within their control — a difference with obvious ramifications for the usefulness of positive psychology’s books and interventions.</p><p>  值得注意的是，任何人似乎都在近十年来批判地评估了Lyubomirsky在同行评审日期的阳光下索赔。但是，当尼古拉斯J.L. Brown和Julia M. Rohrer所做的时候，对于4月2020年4月的文章在幸福研究杂志上发表，他们发现了许多统计问题。在其他之外，“只有非常有限的证据可以将图形放置在低于（精确）50％的潜在遗传性。因此，几乎没有理由相信40％是可靠的估计可归因于有意活动的慢性幸福的差异 - 例如，如果Lyubomirsky等人。选择了不同的（但是，在我们认为，至少同样合理的）估计中，它们可能很容易得出结论，慢性幸福的差异只有[5％]可以归因于无与伦比的活动。“足以说，个人幸福水平的5％至40％的巨大差异在他们的控制之中 - 与积极心理学书籍和干预措施的有用性的明显后果的差异。</p><p> It’s little surprise, in light of all this, that both external and internal critics have argued that positive psychology has made unwarranted claims. “The first data on rigorously tested positive psychology have only recently begun to show up in journals,” wrote the positive psychologists Todd B. Kashdan and Michael F. Steger in 2011, “yet people have been offering to ‘apply’ positive psychology for several years already. What kind of message does this convey about the scientific endeavor of positive psychology? Is it any wonder that positive psychology is often dismissed as ‘happiology’ or the equivalent of accepting a Dixie cup of Kool-Aid from Jim Jones?” As Horowitz writes in  Happier?, a primary concern of some positive psychologists “involved the dangers of popularization,” of polishing rough claims to make them look smoother for marketing purposes.</p><p> 鉴于这一切，它既有意义就令人惊讶，即外部和内部评论家都认为积极的心理学已经造成了无罪要求。 “关于严格测试的积极心理学的第一个数据才刚刚开始出现在期刊上，”2011年，“人们”在2011年撰写了正面的心理学家Todd B. Kashdan和Michael F. Steger。“然而，人们一直在提供”申请“积极的心理学几年已经。这对积极心理学的科学努力提供了什么样的信息？是否令人想到的是，积极的心理学经常被视为“快乐学”或相当于接受来自Jim Jones的Dixie杯桶助剂？“随着霍洛维茨更快乐的？，一些积极的心理学家的主要关注点“涉及普及的危险”，抛光粗劣的声称，使他们看起来更令人光滑的营销目的。</p><p>  But these serious questions surrounding the field’s rigor haven’t stopped positive psychology from quite successfully selling its wares to the public. One key player in that economy is Seligman’s Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Founded in 2003, the center has been good, from both a public-relations and a financial standpoint, for the university that hosts it. In his center’s annual reports, Seligman regularly notes that “the PPC is financially self-sustaining and contributes substantial overhead to Penn.”</p><p>  但是，这些围绕该领域严格的这些严肃的问题并没有停止积极的心理学，从相当成功地向公众销售。该经济中的一个关键球员是宾夕法尼亚大学的Seligman的积极心理中心。该中心成立于2003年，该中心一直很好，来自举办举办它的大学的公共关系和金融立场。在其中心的年度报告中，Seligman定期注意到，“PPC在经济上自我维持，并为宾夕法尼亚州提供了大量的开销。”</p><p> The PPC’s s most important client is probably the U.S. Army. That’s thanks to the fact that in 2008 the Army turned to Seligman to help it solve a crisis involving PTSD and suicide among soldiers, rewarding him and his academic home base with what would become many millions of dollars’ worth of military contracts. To a keen observer of the Positive Psychology Center’s offerings and promotional style, it might have come across as a questionable bet. On multiple occasions, Seligman and his center have made impressive claims about interventions that outpace the available evidence.</p><p> PPC最重要的客户可能是美国军队。这归功于，2008年，军队转向塞利格曼帮助它解决士兵之间的危机，并奖励他和他的学术家庭基地，其中包括数百万美元的军事合同。对于积极的心理中心提供和促销风格的热衷观察者，可能会遇到一个可疑的赌注。多次，Seligman和他的中心对分离可用证据的干预措施令人印象深刻。 </p><p> One example is the so-called Strath Haven Positive Psychology Curriculum, which is named for the suburban Philadelphia high school where it was piloted. Its “major goals . . . are 1) to help students identify their signature character strengths and 2) to increase students’ use of these strengths in day-to-day life,” write Seligman and some of his colleagues in an article in the  Oxford Review of Education. The researchers explain that 347 ninth graders were assigned to either a class that included the curriculum or a control group in which the school day was business as usual. “Students, their parents and teachers completed standard questionnaires before the programme, after the programme, and through two years of follow-up,” write the authors. “Questionnaires measured students’ strengths (e.g., love of learning, kindness), social skills, behavioural problems and enjoyment of school. In addition, we examined students’ grades.”</p><p>一个例子是所谓的Strath Haven积极心理学课程，该课程被指定为郊区费城高中驾驶。它的“主要目标”。 。 。是1）帮助学生确定他们的签名性格优势和2）增加学生在日常生活中使用这些优势，“写Seligman和他的一些同事在牛津教育审查中的一篇文章中。研究人员解释说，347年第九年级学生被分配给包括课程或对照组的课程，其中学校日常是常用的业务。 “学生，他们的父母和教师在计划前完成了标准问卷，在计划之后，并通过两年的后续行动，”写作作者。 “调查问卷测量了学生的优势（例如，喜欢学习，善意），社交技巧，行为问题和学校的享受。此外，我们检查了学生的成绩。“</p><p> Strikingly, even though these researchers were given almost $3 million to run a randomized controlled evaluation of their intervention, they never published one in comprehensive form. The  Oxford Review article’s brief discussion of the program provides some provisional results, but few of the statistical details one would expect in a full-blown published evaluation. The authors make a somewhat vague claim about improved grades being seen in one subgroup (and presumably not others), but provide no statistics to back it up. It’s clear, though, that the general results were disappointing: “The positive psychology programme did not improve other outcomes we measured, such as students’ reports of their depression and anxiety symptoms, character strengths, and participation in extracurricular activities.”</p><p> 令人惊讶的是，即使这些研究人员近300万美元，运行随机对照评估他们的干预，他们从未以综合形式出版。牛津审查文章的简要讨论该计划提供了一些临时结果，但统计细节中的少数人会在全面发表的评估中预期。作者对改进的成绩进行了一些模糊的索赔（并且推测不是其他人），但不提供统计数据。但是，这是明确的，即一般结果令人失望：“积极的心理学计划没有改善我们衡量的其他结果，例如学生的抑郁和焦虑症状，性格优势和参与课外活动的报告。”</p><p> And yet if a school administrator curious about Seligman’s track record visited the “Resilience Training for Educators” section of his Penn website, they’d find a rosier assessment: There, Seligman claims that the Strath Haven program “builds character strengths, relationships, and meaning, as well as raises positive emotion and reduces negative emotion.”</p><p> 然而，如果学校管理员对Seligman的赛道记录有所了解，它访问了他宾夕法尼亚州网站的“教育家的恢复训练”部分，他们会发现一个Rosier评估：那里，Selatman声称Strath Haven计划“建立性格优势，关系和关系意思，以及提高积极的情绪并减少负面情绪。“</p><p> Seligman’s tendency to overclaim can also be seen in the case of the Penn Resilience Program, or PRP. PRP is one of the Positive Psychology Center’s biggest “hits”; it has been purchased by schools all over the world and adapted to various noneducational settings as well.</p><p> 在宾夕法尼亚州补救们计划或PRP的情况下，SELIGMAN的倾向也可以看出。 PRP是积极的心理中心最大的“命中”之一;它已被世界各地的学校购买，并适应各种非教育环境。</p><p> PRP, which was first created by Jane Gillham in the 1990s, is geared to 10- to 14-year-olds, and its goal is to improve these students’ mental-health outcomes, particularly by making them more resistant to depression. The trainings are usually conducted not by licensed mental-health professionals but by others (usually teachers) who can, in theory, be quickly trained up to the task: As Gillham and her colleagues write, the program’s leaders “typically participate in a 4- or 5-day training workshop, where they first apply PRP skills in their own lives and then learn to deliver the curriculum to groups of late-elementary and middle school students.”</p><p> 在20世纪90年代Jane Gillham首次创建的PRP旨在为10至14岁，其目标是提高这些学生的心理健康成果，特别是使它们更耐抑郁症。培训通常不是由许可的心理健康专业人士进行，而是由其他人（通常是教师），他们可以在理论上迅速培训到任务：作为Gillham和她的同事写作，该计划的领导者“通常参加4-或5天的培训研讨会，他们首先在自己的生活中申请PRP技能，然后学会将课程提供给初级和中学生的团体。“</p><p>  The program is delivered to groups of six to 15 students over the course of about 20 hours, total, though the number and length of individual sessions can vary. The primary purpose is to help the children and early adolescents better understand basic cognitive behavioral principles, including the potential harms of negative self-talk ( I failed this test; I really am just worthless) and catastrophizing ( My mom was supposed to be home by now; she must have gotten into a horrible accident). The goal is to instill, in healthy young people, cognitive habits and skills that will prevent depression and anxiety in the long run (though there are also variants geared at groups of kids already exhibiting mental-health warning signs).</p><p>  该计划在大约20个小时内送到六到15名学生的群体，尽管各个会话的数量和长度可能会有所不同。主要目的是帮助儿童和早期青少年更好地了解基本的认知行为原则，包括负面自我谈话的潜在危害（我未能失败;我真的毫无价值）和灾难性（我的妈妈被认为是回家的现在;她必须变成可怕的事故）。目标是灌输，在健康的年轻人，认知习惯和技能中，即长期以来会阻止抑郁和焦虑的技能（尽管还有在已经表现出心理健康警告标志的孩子群体中造成的变体。</p><p> The Positive Psychology Center clearly views the Penn Resilience Program as one of its premier offerings. In a talk he gave at the 2009 annual conference of the American Psychological Association, Seligman presented the results of a review of 19 PRP studies conducted over 20 years. The accompanying APA press release noted that “based on the students’ assessments of their own feelings, the researchers found that PRP increased optimism and reduced depressive symptoms for up to a year. The program also reduced hopelessness and clinical levels of depression and anxiety. Additionally, the PRP worked equally well for children from different racial/ethnic backgrounds.”</p><p> 积极的心理中心明确看着宾夕法尼亚州恢复力计划作为其首要产品之一。在谈话中，他在2009年美国心理协会年度会议上发布了2009年年度会议，Seligman提出了对20多年进行的19项PRP研究的审查结果。伴随的APA新闻稿指出，“基于学生对自己的感受的评估，研究人员发现，PRP持续乐观，减少了一年的抑郁症状。该计划还减少了绝望和临床水平的抑郁和焦虑。此外，PRP对来自不同种族/民族背景的儿童同样适用。“ </p><p> Unfortunately, Seligman doesn’t appear to have ever published this review of the literature anywhere (I did ask him about this directly in an email, and in response he pointed me to other research instead), so it’s unclear how impressive the effects he found were, what criteria he used to include or exclude given studies, and so forth. But another, more formally conducted review of the literature — a meta-analysis co-written by Gillham herself — came to a different conclusion.</p><p>不幸的是，Seligman似乎没有出版过的文献审查（我确实在电子邮件中直接问过他，而且在回应中，他将我指向其他研究），所以还不清楚他发现的效果多么令人印象深刻的效果是，他用于包括或排除给定研究的标准，等等。但另一个，更为正式对文献进行了审查 - 由Gillham自己共同编写的Meta分析 - 出现了不同的结论。</p><p> That meta-analysis, led by Steven Brunwasser and published in 2009, examined 17 controlled evaluations of the PRP — that is, studies that compared the outcomes of a PRP group and a control group. It found that while the PRP did appear to reduce depressive symptoms among students exposed to it, those reductions were small, statistically speaking. “Future PRP research should examine whether PRP’s effects on depressive symptoms lead to clinically meaningful benefits for its participants, whether the program is cost-effective, ... and whether PRP is effective when delivered under real-world conditions,” the authors concluded.</p><p> Meta分析由Steven Brunwasser领导并于2009年发布，研究了PRP的17项受控评估 - 也就是说，比较PRP组和对照组的结果进行研究。它发现，虽然PRP似乎减少了暴露于它的学生之间的抑郁症状，但这些减少在统计上说话。 “未来的PRP研究应该检查PRP对抑郁症状的影响是否导致其参与者对其参与者的临床有意义的益处，无论该计划是否具有成本效益，......以及PRP是否在现实世界条件下交付时是有效的，”作者在作者结束时。</p><p> This is not an impressive evaluation, referring as it did to a program already being sold to schools on the basis of its supposedly impressive evidence base. And in 2016, the  Journal of Adolescence delivered an even harsher verdict about PRP in another meta-analysis. “No evidence of PRP in reducing depression or anxiety and improving explanatory style was found,” the authors wrote. “The large scale roll-out of PRP cannot be recommended.”</p><p> 这不是一个令人印象深刻的评估，就像在其据说令人印象深刻的证据基础的基础上那样推荐。在2016年，青春期杂志在另一种荟萃分析中达到了关于PRP的Harsher判决。 “没有发现在减少抑郁或焦虑和改善解释性的PRP证据，”作者写道。 “不推荐使用PRP的大规模滚动。”</p><p> Seligman, for his part, pointed me to a 2015 meta-analysis conducted by researchers in Australia and New Zealand that appears to show that PRP has some effectiveness. But a close look reveals that that meta-analysis doesn’t tell an appreciably different story from the one told by Brunwasser and Gillham’s evaluation, especially when it comes to the specific “flavor” of PRP that makes the program so attractive on the grounds of potential cost-effectiveness — one in which the intervention is delivered to (mostly) healthy students by laypeople who can be quickly trained for that task. In fact, the researchers from Australia and New Zealand themselves write that “Our results are consistent with another review of the PRP” — and cite the underwhelming meta-analysis by Brunwasser and Gillham.</p><p> 为他的部分，塞利格曼将我指向2015年由澳大利亚和新西兰进行的2015年荟萃分析，似乎表明PRP有一些有效性。但仔细的外观揭示了Meta分析从Brunwasser和Gillham的评价告诉讲述的那个，特别是当涉及到PRP的具体“味道”时，这使得该计划在理由中如此吸引人潜在的成本效益 - 其中干预措施被送入（大多数）健康的学生，这些人可以快速为该任务训练。事实上，来自澳大利亚和新西兰的研究人员自己写的是“我们的结果与对PRP的另一审查一致” - 并引用了布伦沃尔和吉尔姆的强大的荟萃分析。</p><p> Whatever the reasons for PRP’s shortcomings, as of 2020 many of the Positive Psychology Center’s clients around the world don’t appear to have gotten the message; they keep purchasing it. In fact the program’s purview has expanded beyond schools. The PPC’s 2018 annual report touts the fact that the center received a two-year grant from the Department of Justice to adapt PRP for law-enforcement personnel, as well as contracts to develop similar programs for the medical schools at Yale and Penn, among myriad other clients. Over all, notes Seligman in his report, “Since 2007, we have delivered more than 270 Penn Resilience Programs to more than 50,000 people.” The fact that these are adult contexts adds a whole other layer of uncertainty given that PRP was designed for kids.</p><p> 无论PRP的缺点原因如何，截至2020年的许多积极的心理中心，世界各地的客户似乎似乎没有得到这一消息;他们一直在购买它。事实上，该计划的PURVIEW已经超越学校。 PPC 2018年度报告宣布该中心认为，该中心获得了司法部的两年批准，以适应法律执法人员，以及合同，为耶鲁和宾夕法尼亚州耶鲁和宾夕法尼亚州的医学院制定类似的计划其他客户。过度，在他的报告中，“自2007年以来，我们已经向超过50,000人交付了超过270名宾馆的康复计划。”鉴于PRP为孩子设计，这些是成人背景的事实增加了整个其他不确定性。</p><p>  The Positive Psychology Center has had a substantial impact on education around the country, but the adoption of its ideas by the U.S. military may be more consequential still. It is here that what Daniel Horowitz calls the “dangers of popularization” come most clearly into focus.</p><p>  积极的心理学中心对全国各地的教育产生了大量影响，但通过美国军队通过其思想可能更加紧张。在这里，丹尼尔霍洛维茨呼吁“普及危险”最清晰地焦点。</p><p> Around 2007 the U.S. Army realized it had a full-blown mental-health crisis on its hands. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had stretched personnel thin, to the point where, in order to keep numbers up, the Pentagon was forced to revise longstanding rules about the length of combat deployments. This led to more and longer deployments, with less time off between them, and to increasing numbers of National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve personnel — individuals who had, in many cases, signed up imagining their service would entail “one weekend a month, two weeks a year” of peacetime drills and perhaps occasional domestic disaster relief, as one slogan for the National Guard put it — being sent repeatedly to active combat zones.</p><p> 大约2007年美国军队意识到它的手中有一个完整的心理健康危机。伊拉克和阿富汗的战争已经拉长了人员瘦，到了该点，为了保持数字，五角大楼被迫修改关于战斗部署长度的长期规定。这导致了越来越长的部署，他们之间的时间越多，以及越来越多的国民卫队和美国陆军预备署人员 - 在许多情况下，在许多情况下签署他们的服务将需要“一个周末一个月，两个一年的星期一次“和平时间，也许偶尔的国内救灾，作为国民守卫的一个口号把它送到了积极的战斗区。 </p><p> Soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan, like their predecessors in Vietnam, became occupiers of lands where they mostly didn’t speak the language, often couldn’t tell friend from foe, and were beset by threats that came seemingly out of nowhere. The results were staggering: about 15.7 percent of deployed veterans and 10.9 percent of non-deployed veterans screened positive for PTSD during this era, according to a major study, compared with a lifetime prevalence of about 6.8 percent in the general population. In 2002, a terrifying uptick in suicides among Army soldiers, who bore the brunt of the conflicts, began, and many of those deaths appeared to be directly connected to PTSD symptoms. There was also a series of horrible killings and other violent crimes committed by soldiers who had been exposed to trauma — these were less common but appeared to get far more media attention.</p><p>伊拉克和阿富汗的士兵就像他们在越南的前辈一样，成为占领者的土地，他们主要没有说这种语言，往往无法从敌人那里告诉朋友，并且被似乎不无所事事的威胁困扰着。根据一项重大研究，结果令人惊叹：大约15.7％的部署退伍军人和10.9％的非部署退伍军人筛查了PTSD阳性，而普遍存在的一项普遍存产约为6.8％。 2002年，陆军士兵的自杀者恐怖的上升，他们开始冲突，开始，许多死亡似乎直接与应激病症状联系起来。还有一系列可怕的杀戮和其他暴露在创伤的士兵犯下的犯罪罪行 - 这些不太普遍，但似乎越来越多的媒体关注。</p><p> In October 2007, Col. Jill W. Chambers, an energetic survivor of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon who had herself been diagnosed with PTSD, was handed the monumental task of figuring out how to solve this problem. Adm. Michael Mullen, who had just arrived at the Pentagon as the new chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, named her “Special Assistant to the Chairman for Returning Warrior Issues” and gave her a simple imperative, as she described it to me: “Jill, go forth, get away from the Pentagon — get out there and start talking to people and find out what it is that’s causing our service members so many problems.” Chambers took on her new role with gusto. “For the next eight months, I was out and about all over the world,” she explained. She had contacts throughout the armed forces, so she traveled all over the country to have conversations with those who were shouldering the heaviest load of the ongoing wars. “It got to be,  Jill’s coming in, she’s cool, please get your guys to talk with her,” Chambers explained with evident pride. Over and over, soldiers back from Iraq and Afghanistan would tell Chambers stories of trauma tinged with stigma.</p><p> 2007年10月，Col.Jill W.

He was scared of his own behavior, but also scared of speaking about it aloud. “Look, if you tell anybody about this, I’m going to deny it,” he told Chambers. This was a crisis, and it was clear the military needed to do something. That  something arrived via a coincidence.
