But when he reached me by phone in October 2020, he was just one more frightened father. Days earlier, he and his wife had checked their 16-year-old son into Seattle Children’s Hospital for credible threats of suicide. Now, Ahmed was worried that the white coats who had gently admitted his son to their care would refuse to return him.</p><p>艾哈迈德是一名巴基斯坦移民，一个忠实的穆斯林，直到最近是西雅图高科技行业的财务顾问。但是当他在2020年10月通过电话到达我时，他只是一个害怕的父亲。前几天，他和他的妻子已经检查了16岁的儿子进入西雅图儿童医院，以便可靠的自杀威胁。现在，艾哈迈德担心那些轻轻地承认他儿子的白色外套将拒绝回归他。</p><p> “They sent an email to us, you know, ‘you should take your ‘daughter’ to the gender clinic,’” he told me.</p><p> “他们发了一封电子邮件给我们，你知道，'你应该把你的”女儿“到性别诊所，”他告诉我。</p><p> At first, Ahmed (I have changed names in this essay to protect the identities of minor children) assumed there had been a mistake. He had dropped off a  son, Syed, to the hospital, in a terrible state of distress. Now, the email he received from the mental health experts used a new name for that son and claimed he was Ahmed’s daughter. “They were trying to create a customer for their gender clinic . . . and they seemed to absolutely want to push us in that direction,” he said when I spoke to him again this May, recalling the horror of last October. “We had calls with counselors and therapists in the establishment, telling us how important it is for him to change his gender, because that’s the only way he’s going to be better out of this suicidal depressive state.”</p><p> 起初，艾哈迈德（我在本文中改变了名字，以保护未成年子女的身份）假设存在错误。他以一种可怕的痛苦状态下放了一个儿子。现在，他从心理健康专家那里收到的电子邮件使用该儿子的新名称，并声称他是艾哈迈德的女儿。 “他们试图为他们的性别诊所创造一个客户。 。 。他们似乎绝对希望朝着那个方向推动我们，“当我再次对他谈到这个可能的时候，我可能会召回去年10月的恐怖。 “我们在建立方面与辅导员和治疗师打电话，告诉我们他对他改变性别的重要性，因为这是他将更好地摆脱这种自杀抑郁状态的方式。”</p><p> Syed had been a “straight-A student” and—according to his parents and the family’s therapist—quite brilliant. He is also on the autism spectrum, a young man who neglects to make eye contact and must be given rules for how long to shake hands, shower, or brush his teeth. High school was a slog for him, as it often is for kids on the spectrum who find that the social demands of adolescence have risen beyond their capacity to meet them. “He tried to ask a few girls out. It didn’t work out and he got frustrated and angry, and that kind of thing. And so, those girl-boy things get kind of tough for autistic kids, those developmental issues. And that’s where puberty can be very, very hard with the hormones rushing and all this stuff.”</p><p> Syed一直是一个“直接学生”和 - 根据他的父母和家人的治疗师 - 非常辉煌。他还在自闭症谱上，一个忽视了解目光接触的年轻人，并且必须给予握手，淋浴或刷牙多长时间的规则。高中对他来说是一个漫步，因为它通常是孩子们的频谱，谁发现青春期的社会需求升起超越其能力。 “他试图问一些女孩。它没有锻炼，他沮丧和生气，那种东西。所以，那些女孩男孩对自闭症的孩子来说，那些难以让自闭症的孩子们，那些发展问题。这就是青春期可以非常非常难受的荷尔蒙斯冲和所有这些东西。“</p><p> When lockdowns hit, the boy who was already struggling socially and befuddled by questions neurotypical teens take for granted ( How do I show a girl I like her? How do I make the other kids include me?) began to spend all day and night on the Internet. “He’s an autistic kid, and so he kind of lost track of time. And he was staying up a lot. So he was staying up, just being on the Internet, Twitter, Tumblr, whatever. . . . And he was in his room, just, you know, sleeping one or two hours a day. And that can really be devastating. He was very confused. He was seeing things, visual hallucinations. And we didn’t know why.”</p><p> 当锁定命中时，那些已经在社交和遭受的问题被犯规的男孩被神经典型的青少年被视为理所当然（我如何展示一个女孩，我喜欢她？我如何让其他孩子包括我？）开始整天和夜间度过互联网。 “他是一个自闭症的孩子，所以他有点失去了时间。他熬夜了。所以他熬夜了，只是在互联网上，推特，tumblr，无论如何。 。 。 。他在他的房间里，你知道，每天睡一两个小时。这真的可以毁灭。他非常困惑。他看到了东西，视觉幻觉。我们不知道为什么。“</p><p> It is not definitively known why many neurodiverse adolescents identify as transgender, but more than one scientist has pointed out the high rates of coincidence. As several autism experts have explained to me, those on the spectrum tend to fixate, and when a contagious idea is introduced to them—such as the notion that they might be a “girl in a boy’s body”—they are particularly susceptible to it.</p><p> 它并不明确地知道为什么许多神经偏见的青少年识别为跨候，但多于一个科学家指出了巧合的高率。由于几位自闭症专家向我解释了，那些频谱的人倾向于固定，当被引入传染性的想法 - 例如他们可能是男孩身体中的一个“女孩”的概念 - 他们特别容易受到它。</p><p> As child psychiatrist and expert in gender dysphoria Susan Bradley said to me: “The messages these kids pick up [from trans influencers] when they’re online is, ‘We’re the only people who understand you. Your people, your parents, don’t really understand you.’ And it may be the first time in their lives that anybody has said to them, ‘We understand you. We know you. You’re okay. You’re just like us.’ And it’s powerful.”</p><p> 作为儿童精神病医生和性别困难苏珊布拉德利的专家对我说：“这些孩子在网上拿起[来自反式影响者]的信息是，”我们是唯一一个了解你的人。你的父母，你的父母，不要真正了解你。“它可能是任何人都对他们说的第一次，”我们理解你。我们认识你。你还好。你就像我们一样。“它很强大。” </p><p> I asked Bradley if introducing gender ideology to kids who tend to fixate is like introducing cocaine to those susceptible to addiction. She agreed: “It has the same power to assuage all the alienation and grief and distress that these kids have been struggling with.”</p><p>如果向倾向于固定的孩子介绍性别意识形态，我问布拉德利就像将可卡因引入那些易受成瘾的人一样。她同意了：“它具有相同的力量来缓解这些孩子一直在努力的所有异化和悲伤和痛苦。”</p><p> Because of a Covid-19 policy, Ahmed could not stay at the hospital with his son back in October. Syed, in a sleep-deprived and confused state, furious at the parents who had admitted him, and in consultation with hospital staff and a social worker, decided that his problem was gender.</p><p> 由于Covid-19政策，艾哈迈德在10月份无法留在儿子的医院。在一个睡眠剥夺和困惑的状态下，在曾经承认他的父母和与医院工作人员和社会工作者协商的父母中愤怒地决定他的问题是性别。</p><p> The age at which minors in the State of Washington can receive mental health and gender-affirming care without parental permission is  13. In other words, the emails Ahmed received from the hospital were effectively a courtesy; the hospital did not require Ahmed’s permission to begin his son on a path to medical transition.</p><p> 在华盛顿州未成年人可以接受心理健康和性别肯定的人的年龄，没有父母许可是13.换句话说，从医院收到的电子邮件有效地提供了礼貌;该医院不需要艾哈迈德的许可在医疗过渡的道路上开始他的儿子。</p><p> But unlike some other parents I would later speak with, Ahmed’s cool head prevailed. Believing he might be walking into a trap, Ahmed reached out to both a lawyer and a psychiatrist friend he trusted. The psychiatrist gave him advice that he believes saved his son, saying, in Ahmed’s words: “You have to be very, very careful, because if you come across as just even a little bit anti-trans or anything, they’re going to call the Child Protective Services on you and take custody of your kid.” The lawyer told Ahmed the same: “What you want to do is agree with them and take your kid home. When the gender counselors advise you to ‘affirm,’ go along with it. Just say ‘Uh-huh, uh-huh, okay, let’s take him home, and we’ll go to the gender clinic.’”</p><p> 但与其他一些父母不同，我以后会说话，艾哈迈德的酷头占了上风。相信他可能正在走进一个陷阱，艾哈迈德伸向律师和一位精神病医生朋友。精神科医生给了他建议，他认为他的儿子拯救了他的儿子，说，在艾哈迈德的话说：“你必须非常非常小心，因为如果你遇到了一点点的反跨或任何东西，他们会去打电话给您的儿童保护服务并保留您的孩子。“律师告诉艾哈迈德的同样：“你想做的就是同意他们并带上你的孩子回家。当性别顾问建议你“肯定”时，请与之相信。只是说'UH-HUH，UH-HUH，好的，让他带他回家，我们会去性诊所。“</p><p> Ahmed assured Seattle Children’s Hospital that he would take his son to a gender clinic and commence his son’s transition. Instead, he collected his son, quit his job, and moved his family of four out of Washington.</p><p> 艾哈迈德保证了西雅图儿童医院，他会把他的儿子带到性别诊所并开始他的儿子的过渡。相反，他收集了他的儿子，退出了他的工作，让他的四口之家离开华盛顿。</p><p> Was Ahmed’s reaction extreme? When I first heard it, back in October 2020, I wondered whether he hadn’t overreacted. But as a growing number of parents began contacting me with similar stories, and I delved into the state laws of Washington, Oregon, and California, I came to a different conclusion. Taken individually, no single law in any state completely strips parents’ rights over the care and mental health treatment of their troubled minor teens. But pieced together, laws in California, Oregon, and Washington place troubled minor teens as young as 13 in the driver’s seat when it comes to their own mental health care—including “gender affirming” care—and renders parents powerless to stop them.</p><p> 艾哈迈德的反应极端了吗？当我第一次听到它时，回到2020年10月，我想知道他是否没有反应过度。但作为越来越多的父母开始与我与类似的故事联系，我已经进入了华盛顿，俄勒冈州和加利福尼亚州的国家法律，我得出了不同的结论。单独采取，任何国家没有单一法律完全将父母的权利与他们陷入困境的小青少年的护理和心理健康待遇。但拼凑在一起，加利福尼亚州，俄勒冈州的法律，以及华盛顿陷入困境的小青少年作为驾驶员座位上的13岁，当涉及自己的心理保健 - 包括“性别肯定”关心 - 而赋予父母无力阻止他们。</p><p> Here, for instance, are the powers granted to a 13-year-old child by the state of Washington. Minors age 13 and up are entitled to admit themselves for  inpatient and  outpatient mental health treatment without parental consent. Health insurers  are forbidden from disclosing to the insured parents’ sensitive medical information of minor children—such as that regarding “gender dysphoria [and] gender affirming care.” Minors aged 13 to 18 can withhold mental health records from parents for “ sensitive” conditions, which  include both “gender dysphoria” and “gender-affirming care.” Insurers in Washington  must cover a wide array of “gender-affirming treatments” from tracheal shaves to double mastectomies.</p><p> 例如，在这里，由华盛顿州授予13岁的孩子的权力。未成年人13岁及以上有权承认没有父母同意的住院和门诊心理健康治疗。禁止储存卫生保险公司披露给未成年子女的被保险人的父母敏感的医疗信息 - 例如关于“性别困难[和]性别肯定关怀的人。 13至18岁的未成年人可以扣留来自父母的心理健康记录，以“敏感”条件，包括“性别疑似”和“性别肯定的关怀”。华盛顿的保险公司必须涵盖从气管剃须的一系列“性别肯定的治疗方法”到双重乳房切除术。 </p><p> Put these together, and a seventh grader could be entitled to embark on “gender affirming care”—which may include anything from a provider using the child’s name and pronouns to the kid preparing to receive a course of hormones—without her parents’ permission, against her parents’ wishes, covered by her parents’ insurance, and with the parents kept in the dark by insurance companies and medical providers.</p><p>把这些放在一起，第七层的学生可以有权踏上“性别肯定关怀” - 它可能包括使用孩子的名字和代词的提供者向孩子准备接受荷尔蒙的课程 - 没有父母的许可，反对她的父母的愿望，被父母的保险所涵盖，父母被保险公司和医疗提供者保存在黑暗中。</p><p> Lest you wonder whether there is some madcap elixir polluting the groundwater of Washington State alone, in 2015, Oregon  passed a law permitting minors 15 and older to obtain puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries at taxpayers’ expense—all without parental consent. In 2018, California  passed a similar bill for all children in foster care, age 12 and up. The California state senate is now considering an  amendment to the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act that would bar health insurers from disclosing medical information to parents about their dependents, on pain of criminal liability.</p><p> 恳求你想知道是否有一些Madcap Elixir污染了华盛顿州的地下水，在2015年，俄勒冈州通过了一项法律，允许未成年人15岁以上的纳税人，交叉性荷尔蒙和手术，没有父母的同意。 2018年，加利福尼亚州通过了一个类似的法案为寄养，12岁及以上的所有孩子。加州州参议院正在考虑对医疗信息法案的机密性修正案，这些法案将律师保险公司披露给父母的医疗信息，就刑事责任痛苦。</p><p> One Washington mother I spoke with, Nicole, has a 16-year-old daughter who struggled with an eating disorder and other mental health problems after being molested by a peer in elementary school. Just before her 13th birthday, the daughter decided she was transgender. “She hated her body, that was truly a real thing,” Nicole told me. “So we wanted to find her help.” But Nicole wasn’t convinced that her daughter had gender dysphoria, since she’d never before shown any signs of discomfort with her biological sex. “She had already been through a whole counseling program with the eating disorder and none of this came up.”</p><p> 一位华盛顿母亲和尼科尔谈到了一个16岁的女儿，在小学的同行骚扰后，有一个16岁的女儿在骚扰后遭到饮食障碍和其他心理健康问题。就在她13岁生日之前，女儿决定了她是变性的。 “她讨厌她的身体，真正是一个真实的东西，”妮可告诉我。 “所以我们想找到她的帮助。”但妮可并不相信她的女儿具有性别困难，因为她从未在以前任何对她的生物学性别表现出任何不适的迹象。 “她已经经历了一个整个咨询计划，饮食失调，这都没有出现。”</p><p> Over the next few years, Nicole’s daughter’s mental health worsened, and she began self-harming. After her daughter attempted suicide in 2019, Nicole took her to the emergency room at Highline Hospital (now St. Anne Hospital) in Burien, Washington. Nicole explained to the social worker at the hospital that, though the daughter was insisting her problem was gender, she’d been beset by a variety of mental health struggles for many years. Nicole said that she and her husband were not convinced by the gender dysphoria self-diagnosis and did not “affirm” their daughter’s trans identity. “The social worker was very nice to us,” Nicole told me. “She didn’t show any indication that she was not believing what we were saying or anything like that.”</p><p> 在接下来的几年里，妮可的女儿的心理健康恶化，她开始自我伤害。在她的女儿在2019年试图自杀之后，妮可在华盛顿州Burien的高线医院（现在圣安妮医院）的急诊室。妮可向医院的社会工作者解释说，虽然女儿坚持她的问题是性别，但多年来，她已经被各种心理健康挣扎困扰着。妮可说，她和她的丈夫并没有被性别疑似自我诊断说服，并没有“肯定”他们的女儿的反式身份。 “社会工作者对我们来说非常好，”妮可告诉我。 “她没有表现出任何迹象表明，她没有相信我们所说的或那样的东西。”</p><p> But a nurse attending Nicole’s daughter who had been through the same thing with his own daughter took pity on Nicole and her husband. When the social worker left the room, Nicole says, he warned them that she was on the way to “emancipate” their child. Washington law does not allow a minor to petition for emancipation until age 16. But according to several parents I spoke with, under the guise of “advising transgender youth of their rights,” social workers will sometimes sprinkle that tidbit onto a 14-year-old, so she knows liberation is only two years away.</p><p> 但是一位参加妮可的女儿，他们在他的女儿身上经历了同样的女儿，怜悯妮可和她的丈夫。当社会工作者离开房间时，妮可说，他警告说，她正在前往“解放”他们的孩子的路上。华盛顿法不允许未成年人提出解放留下的申请，直到16岁到16岁。但根据几个父母，我与“建议转型青年的权利，”社会工作者有时会撒上这个十年的人到14年 - 老，所以她知道解放只有两年的距离。</p><p> Nicole and her husband didn’t wait. They immediately took her home. That was probably a good thing. Her daughter had full rights to go to a shelter where, had she elected to, she could be “affirmed” and started on a path toward medical transition. And, as it turns out, once a troubled teen over the age of 13 elects to stay in a shelter in Washington, it can be fiendishly difficult to extract them. Instead, more than a year later, Nicole reports that her daughter is much better, as is their relationship. The daughter has dropped the idea that she is transgender and is tapering off of anti-depressants.</p><p> 妮可和她的丈夫没有等待。他们马上带了她的家。这可能是一件好事。 Her daughter had full rights to go to a shelter where, had she elected to, she could be “affirmed” and started on a path toward medical transition.事实证明，一旦13岁以上的困难青少年选择在华盛顿留在庇护所，就会难以提取它们。相反，超过一年后，妮可报道她的女儿更好，就像他们的关系一样。女儿已经丢弃了她是变性的想法，并且逐渐减少抗抑郁药。</p><p> Julie’s troubled 14-year-old daughter never identified as transgender. But Julie’s account of her tussle with Washington social workers and youth shelters—the details of which are corroborated by two different police reports—sheds critical light on the state’s approach to at-risk teens aged 13 and up. Julie specifically asked to go on the record about her experience—that’s how angry she is about what happened to her. I’ve masked her last name only to protect her minor daughter, Kayla.</p><p> 朱莉的陷入困境的14岁女儿从未被识别为跨候。但朱莉对华盛顿社会工作者和青年庇护所的讨论者 - 这些细节由两次不同的警察报告 - 棚本的危险性对13岁及以上13岁及以上的危险青少年的危险的方法有关。朱莉专门要求继续记录她的经历 - 这就是她对她发生的事情的生气。我只掩盖了她的姓氏只是为了保护她的小女儿Kayla。 </p><p> Kayla had long suffered severe mood swings, anxiety, and depression, stemming from childhood trauma at the hands of a father who sexually abused her. Though a no-contact court order has kept Julie’s ex-husband away from his daughter for several years, the girl’s depression began spiking in recent months, and she developed worrying signs of mental instability; according to Julie, Kayla’s current therapist has described these symptoms as “textbook borderline personality disorder.”</p><p>Kayla长期以来遭受严重情绪波动，焦虑和抑郁症，源于童年的创伤，父亲的父亲虐待她的父亲。虽然没有联系的法院命令让Julie的前夫远离他的女儿几年，但最近几个月开始尖锐，并且她开发了令人担忧的心理不稳定的迹象;根据朱莉，Kayla的当前治疗师已经将这些症状描述为“教科书边界人格障碍”。</p><p> On March 17, 2021, Julie dropped her daughter off at church youth group. At around 8  , Julie received a call from the pastor that Kayla had threatened to kill herself by overdosing on pills. Kayla didn’t actually have any pills on her, according to the police report filed that day, but she had announced her intention to procure some. When Julie headed to the church, her daughter ran away. The pastor drove Kayla straight to the emergency room at Seattle Children’s Hospital, where she was admitted.</p><p> 朱莉在2021年3月17日，在教堂青年小组下放了女儿。朱莉左右，朱莉收到了牧师的呼吁，即Kayla威胁要通过过量杀死药丸来杀死自己。根据当天提交的警方报告说，凯拉实际上并没有给她任何药丸，但她宣布打算采购一些人。当朱莉去教堂时，她的女儿逃跑了。牧师直接向西雅图儿童医院的急诊室驾驶Kayla，在那里被录取。</p><p> Because of the pandemic, Julie was not allowed into the hospital room with Kayla, but at some point during her daughter’s stay, Julie believes a social worker at the hospital suggested to Kayla that if she didn’t want to go home, she had the right to stay at a youth shelter. After a night in the hospital, Kayla called her pastor and asked to be driven to the YouthCare  Hope Center, a shelter for the protection of kids, ages 12 to 17, experiencing homelessness, abuse, or extreme family conflict.</p><p> 因为大流行，朱莉不允许用凯拉进入医院，但在女儿留下的某些时候，朱莉相信医院的社会工作者建议，如果她不想回家，她有留在青年庇护所的权利。经过一夜的一夜，Kayla叫她的牧师并被要求被驱使到Youthcare希望中心，为保护孩子们，年龄在12到17岁，经历无家可归，虐待或极端的家庭冲突。</p><p> When the hospital called Julie to tell her that Kayla was asking to stay at a homeless shelter, Julie was horrified. “I said, ‘Well, that’s, that’s absurd. She has a home, she has a family who loves her. Clearly, you’re not sending CPS—we’ve done nothing wrong. She doesn’t need to go to shelter.’ And the [hospital staff member] said, ‘Well, she’s 14, so she gets to make that choice for herself.’”</p><p> 当医院叫做朱莉告诉她卡拉被要求留在一个无家可归的避难所，朱莉被吓坏了。 “我说，”那就是那个是荒谬的。她有一个家，她有一个爱她的家庭。显然，你没有发送CPS  - 我们没有做错任何问题。她不需要去庇护。“[医院工作人员]说，”好吧，她是14岁，所以她会为自己做出这个选择。“</p><p> The staff member was right that Kayla had a right to check herself in for inpatient treatment (though the worker was wrong that this particular YouthCare center qualified). Once Kayla got there, extracting her proved a nightmare.</p><p> 工作人员是正确的，Kayla有权检查自己的住院治疗（尽管这位特殊的Youthcare中心有资格）。一旦卡拉到底，提取她证明了一个噩梦。</p><p> Unless Kayla voluntarily exited the shelter, Julie could neither see her daughter nor take her home. And it is very clear that Julie’s daughter did  not want to return home to mom. Among their several mother–daughter disagreements, Kayla was furious with her mother for the rules Julie had established for Internet use. There were boys with whom Kayla conducted online relationships, which Julie worried about; Julie feared that some of these friendships were with adult men posing online as teens. She had attempted to cut off Kayla’s ability to communicate with them.</p><p> 除非Kayla自愿退出避难所，朱莉既不会看到她的女儿也不带她家。很明显，朱莉的女儿不想回到家里。在他们的几个母女分歧中，Kayla对她的母亲为朱莉建立了互联网使用的规则感到愤怒。有kayla在线关系的男孩们，朱莉担心;朱莉担心这些友谊中的一些人与成年男子在线成为青少年。她试图减少凯拉与他们沟通的能力。</p><p> According to Seattle police officer Nathan Bauer’s report, shelter social worker Micaela Leavell was aware that Julie did not want her daughter at the facility. But Leavell told the officer that she “felt it was better” if the girl remained at the shelter because the daughter “feels ‘unsafe’ at her mother’s house.” Officer Bauer noted that Leavell “could not elaborate on any specific concerns” that the girl mentioned other than she “stated she would harm herself if she were returned.” If Julie’s daughter had concrete reasons for “feeling unsafe” in her mother’s home, she seems never to have provided them to any of the bevy of mental health care or social workers who attended her.</p><p> 根据西雅图警察Nathan Bauer的报告，庇护所社会工作者Micaela Leavell意识到朱莉不希望女儿在该设施。但莱佛尔告诉总监，如果女孩留在庇护所因为女儿“感觉不安全”在她母亲的房子里，那么她“觉得它会更好”。“鲍尔官员指出，Leavell“无法阐述任何特定的担忧”，除了她“陈述她会伤​​害她会伤害她的任何特定问题。”如果朱莉的女儿在她母亲家中有“感到不安全”的具体原因，她似乎永远不会向他们提供任何参加她的心理健康护理或社会工作者的任何秃头。 </p><p> Several times a day, for the next few days, Julie called the YouthCare shelter to speak with her daughter. Each time, she was told that her daughter did not want to speak with her. At this point, Julie operated under a cloud of belief that the social workers at the shelter had her daughter’s best interest at heart.</p><p>每天几次，在接下来的几天里，朱莉称你的Youthcare庇护所与她的女儿说话。每次，她都被告知，她的女儿不想和她说话。在这一点上，朱莉在一阵信仰的情况下经营着避难所的社会工作者让她的女儿在心里的最佳利益。</p><p> But Julie retained her daughter’s cell phone. She saw the messages coming in and out, apparently sent by her daughter from a computer at the shelter. And she saw that her daughter had sent the following message to a youth pastor: “Hey! I’m pretty sure I found a lawyer that will help me to stay in the [shelter] program since my social worker/case manager highly suggested that I find one as soon as possible cause he is worried that my mom will try to pull me out.”</p><p> 但朱莉保留了女儿的手机。她看到了进出的信息，显然是她的女儿从庇护所的电脑送来的。她看到她的女儿已经向青少年牧师发了下列信息：“嘿！我很确定我找到了一位律师，这将帮助我留在[庇护]计划以来，自我的社会工作者/案例经理高度建议，我能尽快找到一个原因他担心我的妈妈会试图拉我出去。”</p><p> Julie realized her daughter seemed to be working toward legal emancipation, with the help of a lawyer arranged by the shelter. Julie later learned that the shelter had found her daughter an attorney and was working to try and file a Child in Need of Services petition. This would have made the shelter Kayla’s legal guardian, for all practical purposes.</p><p> 朱莉意识到她的女儿似乎正在努力在庇护所安排的律师的帮助下致力于法律解放。朱莉后来得知避难所找到了她的女儿律师，正在努力提出需要服务请愿的孩子。这将使庇护所的庇护所的法律监护人，以满足所有实际目的。</p><p> Indeed, several parents of trans-identified teens told me that the social workers who had attended to their daughters during a mental health crisis or suicide attempt had begun coaching their daughters on “emancipation,” under the guise of “advising them of their rights.” Many of the social workers encouraged the idea in psychologically vulnerable teens—who likely welcomed the suggestion—that their parents’ rules, decisions, and objections to the teens’ behavior constituted “abuse,” the parents said.</p><p> 事实上，几个跨识别的青少年的父母告诉我，在心理健康危机或自杀企图中向女儿参加了女儿的社会工作者已经开始向“解放，”在“建议他们的权利”下的“解放”。 “许多社会工作者鼓励在心理上脆弱的青少年中的想法 - 父母所说的父母的规则，决定和对青少年行为构成的“虐待”的规则，决定和反对意见。</p><p> Officer Bauer’s report, regarding the case of Julie and her daughter Kayla, tends to corroborate this. Kayla’s case manager, Oscar, volunteered to the police that YouthCare staff “provides the children with information on resources and courses of action, like emancipation, when asked by clients.” (I emailed Oscar to find out how much “asking” a teen needs to do before a social worker suggests emancipation, but I never received a response.) The published Washington State Department of Children, Youth &amp; Families  guidance informs children’s administration staff that they are not permitted to disclose a child’s LGBTQ+ identities to the parents; instructs them to use forms that “clearly distinguish the legal name and gender from chosen name and gender,” presumably to prevent accidental slip-ups on the secret understanding they’ve established with a child to her parents; and requires them to refer a child or youth who wants to participate to “LGBTQ+ related services,” including “behavioral health and medical providers that affirm their identity.” Lest you think that “affirming” by a medical provider merely entails use of name and pronouns, the guidance defines “Gender Affirming” as “medical procedures that changes [ sic] a person’s body to conform to their gender identity.”</p><p> 鲍尔官员的报告，关于朱莉和女儿Kayla的情况，往往会证实这一点。 Kayla的案例经理Oscar志愿向母亲的员工“为儿童提供有关资源和行动课程的信息，如解放，当客户要求时。” （我通过电子邮件发送了奥斯卡，了解在社会工作者建议解放之前的青少年需要做多少“询问”，但我从未收到过回复。）出版的华盛顿国务院，青年＆amp。家庭指导通知儿童的行政人员，不允许向父母披露儿童的LGBTQ +身份;指导他们使用形式“清楚地区分法律名称和性别，”概要，以防止意外防滑对他们与孩子建立给父母的秘密理解;并要求他们推荐一个想要参加“LGBTQ +相关服务”的儿童或青年，包括“确认他们身份的行为健康和医疗提供者”。为了让你认为医疗提供者的“肯定”只是需要使用姓名和代词，指导定义“性别肯定”作为“改变[SIC]一个人的身体符合其性别认同的医疗程序。”</p><p> In the end, it would take a team of eight officers to remove Julie’s daughter forcibly from the shelter. By that time, Julie already had a plan for Kayla’s treatment—in Arizona, where Kayla now resides in an inpatient treatment center for suicidality and depression. But the first order of business was to extract her daughter from Washington.</p><p> 最终，它将采取八名官员，从庇护所强行删除Julie的女儿。到那时，朱莉已经有一个凯拉的待遇计划 - 在亚利桑那州，卡拉拉现在居住在住院治疗中心的自由性和抑郁症。但第一批业务是从华盛顿提取女儿。</p><p> If you’re familiar with the traditional model of youth shelters, you might assume that they are filled with kids whose parents either didn’t want them or subjected them to abuse. But as the definition of “abuse” has expanded to mean everything from physically harming a child to not “affirming” a child’s newly proclaimed gender identity, youth shelters seem to have ballooned to house even children from stable, loving families who desperately want their children back.</p><p> 如果您熟悉传统的青年庇护所模式，您可能会假设他们充满了父母要么不想要它们的孩子，或者让他们虐待他们。但随着“滥用”的定义，意味着从物理上伤害儿童不要“肯定”一个孩子的新宣布的性别认同，青年庇护所似乎甚至是来自稳定，爱情家庭的孩子们甚至拼命地想要孩子的家庭背部。 </p><p> In 2012, agencies responding to a  Williams Institute at UCLA Law survey reported that about 40 percent of the homeless young people they served identified as LGBTQ. From this bare statistic, many infer that LGBTQ teens are being frequently kicked out of their homes by bigoted parents. Far from it.</p><p>2012年，在UCLA法律调查中回应威廉姆斯研究所的机构报告说，约有40％的无家可归的年轻人被确定为LGBTQ。从这种裸露的统计数据来看，许多推断LGBTQ青少年经常被Bigoted父母从家里踢出来。离得很远。</p><p> I asked Alexa Goodenow, an outreach worker at the SafePlace for Youth crisis hotline, which connects at-risk youth with a network of Seattle shelters, what challenges LGBTQ+ youth face that lead them to a shelter. “I would say one of the most common things that we see is just that cultural disconnect between them and their support system,” she said. “So, hypothetically speaking, maybe a young person who’s now identifying as non-binary or coming out as maybe gay or lesbian and bisexual and maybe families aren’t supportive of that. So we do see a lot of that because in the Seattle area, we get a lot of melting pot of backgrounds. So maybe the young person’s views don’t quite align with their at-home support.”</p><p> 我问Alexa Goodenow，在Safeplay的Outracher Wordline的Outreach工作者，其中与风险青年与西雅图庇护所联系起来，LGBTQ +青年面临着避难所的挑战。 “我会说出我们看到的最常见的事情之一，只是他们与他们的支持系统之间的文化断开，”她说。 “所以，假设说话，也许是一个现在识别非二元或出来的年轻人，也许是同性恋或女同性恋和双性恋，也许家庭并不支持。所以我们确实看到了很多，因为在西雅图地区，我们得到了很多融化的背景。所以也许年轻人的观点并不与他们的家庭支持相当一致。“</p><p> Being a teenager is no picnic. But removing minor children from their parents’ home didn’t used to be a matter of a parent–child “cultural disconnect”—or the young person’s views not “quite align[ing] with their at-home support.” The point was to provide sanctuary for children who would otherwise suffer physical harm or psychological torment.</p><p> 作为一个少年没有野餐。但从父母的家中删除未成年子女并不习惯是亲子的“文化断开” - 年轻人的看法并非“与他们的家庭支持相当一致”。“重点是为否则遭受身体伤害或心理折磨的儿童提供庇护所。</p><p> Today, a teenager can declare an LGBTQ identity that is unsupported in her home and claim that this lack of support puts her mental health at risk. “For our young people experiencing homelessness, over 90 percent of them cite family conflict as a cause of homelessness,” said Suzanne Sullivan, Chief Advancement Officer at YouthCare, who confirmed for me that almost 30 percent of the young people at her shelter identify as LGBTQ+. “We see a lot of young people who have different sexual identities or gender identities that are not supported at home. At YouthCare, we believe that every young person deserves </p><p> 今天，一名少年可以宣布在她的家中不受支持的LGBTQ身份，并声称这种缺乏支持将她的心理健康受到风险。 “对于我们的年轻人而遇到无家可归的人，其中90％的人引用了家庭冲突作为无家可归的原因，”Youthcare的首席进步官Suzanne Sullivan说，他们为我确认了近30％的避难所的年轻人识别LGBTQ +。 “我们看到很多年轻人有不同的性身份或家庭不支持的性别身份。在Youthcare，我们相信每个年轻人都应该得到</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.city-journal.org/transgender-identifying-adolescents-threats-to-parental-rights">https://www.city-journal.org/transgender-identifying-adolescents-threats-to-parental-rights</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/孩子/">#孩子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/state/">#state</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/女儿/">#女儿</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
