Kennedy in the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 -- 57 years ago this month. Retired Iowa cardiologist  Joe Goldstrich, MD, responded in the article&#39;s comments, noting that he was &#34;the most junior person actively participating in the JFK resuscitation efforts.&#34;</p><p>本月初，MedPage Today在1963年11月22日在达拉斯的帕克兰纪念医院的急诊室中，发表了一篇有关在美国急诊医师学会年会上有关约翰·肯尼迪总统的治疗的演讲的文章- 57年前的这个月。爱荷华州退休的心脏病专家乔·戈德斯特里奇（MD）对此发表评论，并指出他是“积极参加肯尼迪国际机场复苏工作的最初级的人”。</p><p>   MedPage Today confirmed that Goldstrich was present in Trauma Room One and reached out to the physician, who is now an  advocate for medical cannabis. In an interview, Goldstrich – 25 years old then and 82 now -- spoke about treating the president, nearly treating his assassin, and his one regret.</p><p>   今天的MedPage证实Goldstrich出现在Trauma病房一号，并联系了医生，后者现在是医用大麻的倡导者。在接受采访时，当时25岁，现年82岁的戈德斯特里奇（Goldstrich）谈到了如何对待总统，几乎要对待刺客，以及他的遗憾。</p><p>    Joe Goldstrich, MD: I was a fourth-year medical student on my neurosurgery rotation at Parkland Hospital. Early that morning, we performed an anterior cervical discectomy on a patient. It was the first time this procedure had been done at Parkland.  Dr. Kemp Clark, who was the head of neurosurgery, said the main complication that concerned him for this procedure was that there might be bleeding and it could obstruct the airway, and the patient might need a tracheotomy.</p><p>    马里兰州乔·戈德斯特里奇（Joe Goldstrich）：我是帕克兰医院神经外科旋转专业的四年级医学生。那天清晨，我们对一名患者进行了颈椎前路椎间盘切除术。这是该程序首次在Parkland完成。神经外科负责人肯普·克拉克（Kemp Clark）博士说，令他担心的主要并发症是出血，可能阻塞气道，患者可能需要进行气管切开术。</p><p>  He asked me: Do you know how to do a tracheotomy? And I said yes. Well, I had done one on a cadaver, but I wasn&#39;t really an expert. So I spent the whole morning in the library reading up on tracheotomies, and I checked in on the patient a couple of times to see if he was doing OK.</p><p>  他问我：您知道怎么做气管切开术吗？我说是的。好吧，我曾经在尸体上做过，但是我并不是真正的专家。因此，我整个上午都在图书馆里阅读了气管切开术，然后检查了几次患者，看他是否做得很好。</p><p>   Then there was a STAT page for Dr. Clark around 12 noon. I was in the cafeteria on the first floor of the hospital eating lunch. My first thought was that the reason they were paging Dr. Clark was that this patient had bled and now has obstruction of his airway. And I&#39;m gonna have to do a tracheotomy.</p><p>   然后在中午12点左右为Clark博士提供了一个STAT页面。我在医院二楼的自助餐厅里吃午餐。我首先想到的是，他们向克拉克医生传呼的原因是该患者流血了，现在阻塞了呼吸道。而且我将不得不做气管切开术。</p><p>  I ran up five or six flights of stairs to the floor where the patient was, and I burst into the room. He was sitting in bed, reading a magazine. I said, &#34;Oh, thank God you&#39;re OK. You&#39;re fine. They&#39;re paging Dr. Clark STAT, and I had no idea what it was and thought it might have been you.&#34; He said, &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; but he pointed out the window to where the Kennedy motorcade was pulling into the entrance of the hospital. &#34;Maybe it has something to do with those limousines that are going into the hospital.&#34;</p><p>  我跑了五到六层楼梯到病人所在的地板，然后我冲进了房间。他坐在床上，读杂志。我说：“哦，感谢上帝，你还好。你很好。他们正在寻呼Clark STAT医生，我不知道那是什么，以为可能是你。”他说：“我不知道。”但他指出了通往肯尼迪车队驶入医院入口的窗户。 “也许与进入医院的豪华轿车有关。”</p><p>   I ran down the stairs to the emergency room. I was in my scrubs from the morning. There was already a Secret Service agent at the door. I said &#34;Goldstrich, neurosurgery,&#34; and he let me right in. I got into the emergency room at the same time as JFK was entering on a gurney.</p><p>   我从楼梯上跑到急诊室。我从早上开始在灌木丛中。门口已经有特勤人员了。我说“ Goldstrich，神经外科”，他让我进去。我在肯尼迪（JFK）进入轮床的同时进入急诊室。</p><p>          I helped move him from the gurney to the treatment table and then undress him.</p><p>我帮助他从轮床转移到治疗台，然后脱下衣服。</p><p>  I was also the chief gofer. I went to get the defibrillator, which was about the size of a single-door refrigerator. I pushed it on the casters back from another part of the emergency room to Trauma Room One.</p><p>  我也是首席裁判。我去买了除颤器，它的大小相当于单门冰箱的大小。我把脚轮从急诊室的另一部分推回到创伤室一号。</p><p>     I saw the wound in the lower part of his neck. I looked in the neck wound and saw the cartilage of the trachea on the back side through the hole. I do not remember whether instruments had [yet] been used to expand the wound. I am clear, however, that I saw the posterior aspect of the trachea.</p><p>     我看到他脖子下部的伤口。我看着脖子上的伤口，通过孔看到了背面的气管软骨。我不记得是否曾经使用过器械来扩大伤口。但是，我清楚地看到了气管的后部。</p><p>      When Dr. Clark walked in, [emergency room director]  Dr. Charlie Baxter was doing closed-chest cardiac compressions on JFK. Dr. Clark saw the head wound and said something like, &#34;My God, Charlie, what are you doing? His brains are on the floor.&#34;</p><p>      当克拉克博士走进去时，[急诊室主任]查理·巴克斯特博士正在对肯尼迪国际机场进行闭胸式心脏按压。克拉克博士看到头部受伤，说道：“我的上帝，查理，你在做什么？他的大脑在地板上。”</p><p>  At that moment I was standing on the left side of Kennedy. And Jackie [Kennedy] was further back on his right side, in a corner. Dr. Clark had not seen Jackie. When he did see her, I was right between them. I saw her expression when she heard what he had said. That&#39;s another moment that&#39;s indelibly imprinted on my brain, unfortunately.</p><p>  那一刻，我站在肯尼迪的左边。杰基[肯尼迪]再往右拐，在一个角落里。克拉克博士没有见过杰基。当他看到她时，我就在他们之间。当她听到他的话时，我看到了她的表情。不幸的是，那是刻在我脑海中的那一刻。</p><p>     Jackie was in shock, like a deer in the headlights. She was surprised that someone spoke so bluntly about what was going on.</p><p>     杰基震惊了，就像头灯中的一只鹿。她惊讶于某人对所发生的事情如此坦率地说。</p><p>    He was dead on arrival, in all likelihood. I&#39;m not the expert on that. That&#39;s just my humble, amateur opinion.</p><p>    他很可能在抵达时死亡。我不是那个专家。那只是我谦虚的业余意见。</p><p>  You didn&#39;t talk publicly about assisting in Trauma Room One until you appeared in the 1993 book  JFK: Breaking the Silence. How come?</p><p>直到您出现在1993年的《肯尼迪时代》（JFK）：打破沉默中，您才公开谈论过在创伤一号会议室的协助。怎么来的？</p><p>  Because I was afraid. There were so many people who were associated with the assassination who had died, sometimes by questionable means. Then this guy [author Bill Sloan] tracked me down and wanted an interview. He called me a couple of times, and I said no. And then when he called me again, and I said to myself, &#34;Well, maybe this professional writer can help me with the book that I was writing [about antioxidants and heart disease].&#34;</p><p>  因为我害怕。与暗杀有关联的人如此之多，甚至以可疑的方式死亡。然后，这个人[作者比尔·斯隆（Bill Sloan）]追踪了我，想要接受采访。他打了几次电话给我，我拒绝了。然后当他再次给我打电话时，我对自己说：“好吧，也许这位专业作家可以帮我写我写的书（关于抗氧化剂和心脏病）。”</p><p>   I gave him the interview. It turned out he knew nothing about medicine, and he was no help whatsoever. But that&#39;s what drew me out of my shell.</p><p>   我接受了他的采访。事实证明，他对医学一无所知，也毫无帮助。但这就是吸引我的原因。</p><p>  At first, you believed that JFK was shot in the throat from the front, suggesting the possibility of a second shooter. What changed your mind?</p><p>  起初，您认为肯尼迪国际机场是从前方的喉咙中射出的，这暗示了第二枪手的可能性。是什么改变了您的想法？</p><p>  When I first saw that wound in Trauma Room One, I did not know anything about ballistics and entrance and exit wounds. Then I went into the army in 1965, and I was stationed in the Dominican Republic. After a crash course in entrance and exit wounds by the field hospital commander, I was sent to examine the wound of a Dominican who&#39;d been shot by an American MP. Based on what I had learned, it was clear to me that the Dominican was shot in the back. In that moment, I realized that JFK&#39;s throat wound was probably an entrance wound because the margins were so clean and the wound was so small.</p><p>  当我第一次在创伤房间一看到那伤口时，我对弹道学和进出伤口一无所知。 1965年，我参军，并进驻多米尼加共和国。在野战医院指挥官进出伤口的速成班之后，我被送去检查被美国国会议员枪杀的多米尼加人的伤口。根据我所学到的东西，对我来说很明显多米尼加人被击中了背部。那一刻，我意识到肯尼迪的喉咙伤口可能是入口伤口，因为切缘很干净而且伤口很小。</p><p>   But over the past couple of years, I spent a considerable amount of time watching the Zapruder film. After watching it over and over again, I realized it would be impossible for someone from the front to shoot Kennedy simultaneously with [Lee Harvey] Oswald shooting from behind the president. That&#39;s when I changed my mind. However, no one will ever know for sure.</p><p>   但是在过去的几年中，我花了很多时间观看Zapruder电影。一遍又一遍地看完之后，我意识到从前面来的人不可能和[Lee Harvey] Oswald从总统后面开枪同时射击肯尼迪。那是我改变主意的时候。但是，没人会确定。</p><p>    Absolutely. He got state-of-the-art care. As students, we were told that Parkland had some of the best survival rates in the whole country for trauma patients. This was supposedly due to Dr. Tom Shires, the chief of surgery, popularizing the use of intravenous fluids acutely rather than blood transfusions. The staff and residents in the emergency room were successfully working with trauma patients on a daily basis. At least, that is what I was told as a medical student back then.</p><p>    绝对。他得到了最先进的护理。作为学生，我们被告知，对于创伤患者，帕克兰拥有全国最佳的成活率。据推测，这是由于外科手术主任汤姆·希尔斯（Tom Shires）博士大力推广了使用静脉输液而不是输血。急诊室的工作人员和居民每天都在成功地与创伤患者进行合作。至少，那是我当时作为医学院学生所被告知的。</p><p>     I loved him. I resonated with his philosophy and his agenda. I guess I was a major JFK fan.</p><p>我曾爱过他。我对他的理念和议程产生了共鸣。我想我是肯尼迪大学的主要粉丝。</p><p>  There&#39;s something else: One my best friends growing up in Dallas was named Henry Zapruder. His father was Abraham Zapruder [the Dallas dressmaker who shot the  famous film of the assassination.] I knew the Zapruders very well, and had been in their home many times. [Editor&#39;s note:  MedPage Today reached out to the Zapruder family, which confirms the close friendship.]</p><p>  还有其他事情：我在达拉斯长大的最好的朋友之一叫亨利·扎普鲁德。他的父亲是亚伯拉罕·扎普鲁德（Abraham Zapruder，达拉斯的裁缝，曾拍摄过著名的暗杀电影。）我对扎普鲁德非常了解，而且已经去过他们很多次了。 [编者注：今天的MedPage与Zapruder家族取得了联系，这证实了他们的亲密友谊。]</p><p>    I went into the surgical dressing room and probably put on my street clothes. Then I went outside. There was a big crowd across the street in front of the nursing school dormitory. I just went and mingled in that crowd. I didn&#39;t say a word. I didn&#39;t tell anybody that I was there. I just listened to what they said. And then I went home.</p><p>    我走进手术室，可能穿上了街头衣服。然后我出去了。护士学校宿舍前的马路对面有很多人。我刚走到那群人中。我什么也没说。我没有告诉任何人我在那里。我只是听了他们的话。然后我回家。</p><p>   It must have been a shock to my immune system. On Saturday [Nov. 23] the next day, I had a bad case of the flu when I woke up. But I was on call on surgery on Sunday [Nov. 24], and I came to the hospital even though I was sick.</p><p>   这一定是对我的免疫系统的震惊。星期六[11月。 23]第二天，我醒来时得了流感。但是我在周日需要手术[11月。 24]，即使我病了，我也去了医院。</p><p>  A third-year student named Nick Grivas, who went on to become a neurosurgeon, was also on surgery call that day. I told Nick, &#34;I&#39;m gonna go to the call room and get some rest because I&#39;m not feeling well. But if anything happens, come wake me up.&#34;</p><p>  后来成为神经外科医生的第三年级学生尼克·格里瓦斯（Nick Grivas）也在当天接受手术治疗。我告诉尼克，“我要去呼叫室休息一下，因为我感觉不舒服。但是如果有什么事情发生，那就叫我起床。”</p><p>  When I woke up from my nap and came out into the surgical area, people were running around. I learned that  Oswald had been shot and was being operated on. Nick Grivas had scrubbed in my place.</p><p>  当我从午睡中醒来，走进手术区时，人们四处奔波。我了解到奥斯瓦尔德（Oswald）被枪杀并正在接受手术。尼克·格里瓦斯（Nick Grivas）擦洗了我的位置。</p><p>     Yes. When I looked at JFK&#39;s throat wound, my thoughts were that it was not necessary to expand the hole for the tracheotomy. They could have put the tracheotomy tube directly into the hole without the incisions that were done. I wanted to say that when they started to do the tracheotomy: &#34;You don&#39;t have to do that.&#34;</p><p>     是。当我看着肯尼迪国际机场的喉咙伤口时，我的想法是不必为气管切开术扩大孔。他们可以将气管切开管直接放入孔中，而无需进行切口。我想说的是，当他们开始进行气管切开术时：“您不必这样做。”</p><p>  But remember, I was the most junior person in the room. These were my professors, surgeons and residents who were years ahead of me in their training. So I did not say, &#34;Just put it in the hole, you don&#39;t have to do any cutting.&#34; That would have preserved the nature of the wound, making it more amenable to determining whether it was an entrance or an exit wound.</p><p>但是请记住，我是房间里最普通的人。这些是我的教授，外科医生和住院医师，他们在培训方面比我领先多年。所以我没有说，“只要把它放进洞里，就不必做任何切割。”那将保留伤口的性质，使其更易于确定是伤口还是出口伤口。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/emergencymedicine/emergencymedicine/89772">https://www.medpagetoday.com/emergencymedicine/emergencymedicine/89772</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/国际/">#国际</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/trauma/">#trauma</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/肯尼迪/">#肯尼迪</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
