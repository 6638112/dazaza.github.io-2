It&#39;s syntactically similar to Ruby and it canbe learned  within 15 minutes.Including the compiler, bytecode VM and runtime, it&#39;s a standalone executablewith zero external dependencies just as it&#39;s self descriptive name. The pocketlangVM can be embedded in another hosting program very easily.\n   # Python like import statement. from  lang  import  clock  as  now # A recursive fibonacci function. def  fib ( n )  if  n &lt;  2  then  return  n  end  return  fib ( n- 1 ) +  fib ( n- 2 ) end # Prints all fibonacci from 0 to 10 exclusive. for  i  in  0.. 10  print ( fib ( i ) ) end\n  You can  try pocketlang on your browser.It&#39;s a  WebAssembly build of the VM compiled using  emscripten.Note that in the webassembly version of the language, some features (input, file handling, relative import, etc.)have disabled, has limited memory allocations, and the stdout calls might be slower.\n  The pocketlang documentation is hosted at  https://thakeenathees.github.io/pocketlang/ whichis built from the  docs branch generated by a little python script at  docs/generate.py.Note that the documentations are WIP and might not be up to date.\n  Pocketlang supports  tail call  optimization.When a function returns a call, the callee can re-use the caller&#39;s stack frame, this will optimize memory from O(n) to O(1)and for  tail recursive it&#39;ll completely prevent stackoverflows and yet it&#39;s fasterthen tco disabled.\n All the below benchmarks are ran on, Windows10 (64bit), ASUS N552VX, Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6GHzwith 12GB SODIMM Ram. And the language versions are: pocketlang (pre-alpha), wren v0.3.0,python v3.7.4, ruby v2.7.2.\n  The source files used to run benchmarks could be found at  test/benchmarks/directory. They were ran using a small python script in the test directory.\n  It can be build from source easily without any dependencies, or additional requirementsexcept for a c99 compatible compiler. It can be compiled with the following command.\n       To run make file on windows with  mingw, you require  make and  find unix tools in your path.Which you can get from  msys2 or  cygwin. Run set PATH=&lt;path-to-env/usr/bin/&gt;;%PATH% &amp;&amp; make, this will override the system  find command withunix  find for the current session, and run the  make script.\n   You don&#39;t have to run the script from a Visual Studio .NET developer command prompt, It&#39;ll searchfor the MSVS installation path and setup the build enviornment.\n     Mark W.

\u21a9 ", "note_en": "What question do we expect to answer by holding an election? Elections are how we select our government, but they aren\u2019t the only way to do that. We hold elections because we believe they tell us something about who has the right to control our government in a way that appointments or heredity does not. But different voting methods answer different questions.\n Visualizing our voting systems can help give us a sense of how the questions each system asks shape the answers we get. By playing around with what happens depending on where candidates are relative to each other, you can get a sense of what incentives our voting system gives to the people we elect. We\u2019re going to explore different systems by simulating many elections and seeing how the results change depending on where the average voter is.\n  This diagram shows a single election. The colored circles represent the positions of the candidates and voters in some abstract space. Imagine that the Y axis measures how focused the candidate is on environmental protection, and the X axis measures their position on some other issue like corporate tax rates. Voters prefer candidates that are closer to them. Clicking anywhere on this diagram simulates a new election where the average voter is where you clicked. What that means is that if we averaged together the positions of all of the voters they would be at that point, but if you click on the same point a few times you\u2019ll see that the position of each voter can change.\n Looking at one simulated election doesn\u2019t tell us very much, so we\u2019ll use something called a  Yee diagram to show how the results vary over many simulated elections depending on where the average voter is.\n The US presidential election in 2000 was historic, partially because Ralph Nader chose to ignore those incentives. It was expected to be a tight race between George W Bush and Al Gore, but Nader was running as a third party candidate. Leading up to the election, a group of self identified \u201cNaders Raiders\u201d wrote an open letter to Nader asking him to drop out. They were worried that he would be handing the election to Bush.\n It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush. As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career. You have sacrificed for the benefit of the common good your entire adult life\u2026 It would be a cruel irony indeed if your major legacy were to erase the victory from the candidate who most embodies your philosophy, Al Gore, and to give the Executive Branch to the party which has consistently resisted your progressive ideals.  1\n Carl Pope, the president of the Sierra Club, pleaded with Nader to reconsider his campaign strategy.\n You pledged you would not campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this pledge\u2026 Irresponsible as I find your strategy, I accept that you genuinely believe in it. Please accept that I, and the overwhelming majority of the environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy is flawed, dangerous, and reckless.  2\n The Republican Leadership Council ran campaign ads featuring Nader, believing that the more people that voted for Nader, the better chance Bush had at winning the election.\n Nader, running a low-budget campaign, is not airing any television commercials of his own and it\u2019s possible that the RLC will end up spending more on pro-Nader media that Nader himself.  3\n Why were environmentalists, relatively ideolically similar to Nader, pleading with him not to run? Why were republicans trying to get people to vote for one of their opponents? All of these people believed that votes for Nader would have the effect of electing Bush, because of something known as the  spoiler effect.\n  This visualization is called a  Yee diagram. The background is colored based on who would win if the average voter was at that point. If there is a tie, the background will be grey; the black line just gives us a sense of where the middle is.\n The diagram is generated by simulating an election for each cell of the background, where the voters are randomly distributed around that cell. I would expect an ideal voting method to elect the candidate closest to any given cell.\n These diagrams don\u2019t tell us very much about any individual election, but they can help us explore how elections are shaped by the voting method that we choose. In the 2000 election, all ballots were counted using a method called  plurality voting, where each voter picks their favorite candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. In some sense, plurality voting asks voters which candidate they are most in favor of, but doesn\u2019t ask anything about what they think of the rest of the candidates. This makes it hard for plurality elections to find compromises.\n If only Bush and Gore had been running, the race would have been simple, the winner would be whoever was closer to the center of public opinion. But strange things start to happen when we consider Nader.\n  Because Nader is ideologically closer to Gore, voters are more likely to switch to Nader from Gore than to Nader from Bush. Depending on where we believe the average voter is this might not matter, but if we think that public opinion is somewhere between Bush and Gore, this is very likely to help Bush win. In that situation, plurality voting is unable to identify that for many voters (like Carl Pope and Naiders Raiders for Gore), Gore is a compromise between Nader and Bush. This is the spoiler effect that environmentalists were afraid of, and why republicans wanted to amplify Naders message.\n The lesson many people take from the spoiler effect is that third party candidates harm the platforms they care about, but the spoiler effect doesn\u2019t happen in every voting system. While there are versions of this effect in plurality voting and in  instant runoff voting, other systems like  approval voting don\u2019t have this issue.\n Approval voting ballots look very similar to plurality voting ballots, but voting involves selecting as many of the candidates as you would like rather than only your favorite. If plurality voting is asking voters who their favorite candidate is, approval voting is asking who voters would accept as the winner. The structure of that question gives us more of the information we need to identify compromises. The diagram below shows the dynamics of the same set of candidates, but in an election run with approval voting.   4\n  Approval voting has an important property; if a candidate doesn\u2019t win the race, they don\u2019t affect the results. You can see this in the above diagram; moving candidate A around can change a cell from B to A, but it never changes any cell from B to C. Try moving Nader around, and watch the line between Bush and Gore. That line never moves, other than in areas that Nader now wins.\n In the 2000 election, this stability property would have meant that republicans wouldn\u2019t have had any reason to encourage people to vote for one of their opponents. Environmentalists might have welcomed another candidate fighting for environmental justice, because voters who cared about the environment wouldn\u2019t have to choose between Gore and Nader. Approval voting would give them a way to express that they were ok with either one.\n For a long time the US has treated plurality voting as the only option, but that is changing. Voters in Fargo and St. Louis restructured their elections to use approval voting, and voters in  San Francisco,  Austin,  Seattle,  Missouri, and  Utah are working to change how they vote as well. You might soon have an opportunity to choose how your government is elected. What do you want your voting system to encourage?\n Approval voting has another parameter that we don\u2019t have to think about in the context of plurality voting; how accepting are you? The less accepting you are, the more likely you are to only vote for one candidate, or to refuse to vote at all. The more accepting you are, the more likely you are to be ok with every candidate, and therefore indifferent to the outcome. In the approval diagram, voters vote for anyone within a certain radius of them. While picking a radius that is very small or very large compared to the distribution of voters leads to some strange effects, in practice such behavior is unlikely. A very large radius would mean that most people are voting for every candidate, despite the fact that that means their vote is irrelevant. A very small radius would mean that most people refuse to vote at all unless the perfect candidate is running. \u21a9", "posttime": "2021-06-22 15:50:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

announce that Apache Pinot 0.7.1 was released a few months back in April 2021.  Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed datastore designed to answer OLAP queries with low latency for those of you who are new readers of this blog. This release introduced several fantastic new features, including JSON index, Lookup-based Join support, GeoSpatial support, TLS support for Pinot connections, and various performance optimizations and improvements. It also adds several new APIs to better manage the segments and upload data to an offline table. It also contains many critical bug fixes.\n  A JSON string can represent an array, map, or nested field without forcing a fixed schema. It is very flexible, but it comes at a cost:  filtering on a JSON string column is very expensive.\n Without an index, we need to scan and reconstruct the JSON object from the JSON string for every record to look up a key and filter records based on the value. Then we need to look up the key and compare the value. Pinot\u2019s new JSON index feature is designed to accelerate the filtering on JSON string columns without scanning and reconstructing all the JSON objects.\n  Let\u2019s consider the following JSON structured document ingested into a Pinot table column.\n  By indexing the column, we can now search the JSON document\u2019s structure as quickly as we would by indexing any other Pinot table\u2019s field.\n  Link to the documentation for JSON index with the text of this query can be found here:  JSON Index\n  Lookup-based join support was added in 0.7.1 via a new UDF SQL function named  LOOKUP. This feature is relatively straightforward to get started with. Before this function, you would have been unable to join tables across Pinot in a single SQL query by default without using something like Presto. We\u2019ve now added support for you to join exclusively from a dimension table. Table types other than  dimension are not currently supported. You can find more details about  dimension tables in our documentation.\n   The SQL query above joins the dimension table  dimBaseballTeams into the regular table  baseballStats on the  teamID key. The   LOOKUP(...) function then returns the value of the column    teamName.\n Joins in Apache Pinot are different than the kind of joins you might do in a relational database using SQL. The UDF function here provides a long-awaited feature that is performant and convenient for scalable OLAP joins. This function includes the advantages of Pinot\u2019s advanced indexing capabilities that make real-time analytical SQL queries so fast.\n To see the function in action, you can also fire  JoinQuickstart and test it as follows:\n  To run the JoinQuickstart, you can run the following command in Docker to fire up the example.\n   To get started with this feature in 0.7.1, you will need to use a transform function in your schema definition configuration for a table.\n The first thing you will need to add to your schema definition file to enable geolocation-based queries is your latitude and longitude fields. These fields will be imported from your data source, either from an offline data source or streaming.\n  In your list of fields, which are either imported by their unique name or generated during ingestion using a transform function, you\u2019ll need to list both latitude and longitude fields, as shown above ( lon,  lat). There is nothing too special going on here, but you\u2019ll need to generate a new field to execute real-time geospatial queries on these fields. You\u2019ll need to generate a new field, which I\u2019ve named  location_st_point in the snippet below.\n Just to be clear, both of these snippets are from the same configuration block in your schema definition file.\n  Now that we\u2019ve added the necessary bits to the schema configuration file, we can now move on to updating the table configuration that references the above schema. The changes here are simple and can be seen below. There may be some changes in future versions, so it\u2019s always good to head over to the most  recent version of the Apache Pinot documentation.\n  The final step to enable indexing on geospatial fields is to modify your table configuration with the settings shown above.\n That\u2019s it! After you\u2019ve created your schema and table in Pinot using the above configurations, you\u2019ll be able to start ingesting the now indexed geospatial data and begin executing queries in real-time.\n Check out the full feature blog post for   geospatial support in Pinot 0.7.1 , which continues on with an exploration of the H3 indexing system and its origins at Uber.\n  Support for  TLS-secure connections was also added in 0.7.1. TLS can be configured using the following new (or refactored) properties. Upgrades to a TLS-enabled cluster can be performed safely and without downtime. To achieve a live-upgrade, go through the following steps:\n First, configure alternate ingress ports for https/netty-tls on brokers, controllers, and servers. Restart the components with a rolling strategy to avoid cluster downtime.\n Second, verify manually that HTTPS access to controllers and brokers is live. Then, configure all components to prefer TLS-enabled connections (while still allowing unsecured access). Restart the individual components.\n Third, disable insecure connections via configuration. You may also have to set controller.vip.protocol and controller.vip.port and update the configuration files of any ingestion jobs. Restart components a final time and verify that insecure ingress via HTTP is not available anymore.\n  We would like to take a moment to thank the Pinot community for supporting our Product. We keep a steady amount of  commits for the past year, and we\u2019ve seen that more and more excellent  features are implemented to this project. At this moment, we would like to thank everyone who made contributions to this release.\n    Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.

Mollie, an Amsterdam-based startup that provides a way for businesses to integrate payments into sites, documents and other services by way of an API, is today announcing that it has raised \u20ac665 million ($800 million) in an all-equity round that values the company at \u20ac5.4 billion ($6.5 billion).\n  Mollie has been on a major growth tear in recent years. The company is currently on track to process some \u20ac20 billion (nearly $24 billion) in payments in 2021, up 100% on the year before when it processed around \u20ac10 billion. It currently has 120,000 monthly active merchants (versus 100,000 in 2020), and customers include the likes of Deliveroo, Unicef, Acer and Guess. It\u2019s adding between 400 and 500 new customers each day.\n  To be sure, the pandemic saw a massive shift in commerce with all kinds of transactions \u2014 buying goods, paying for services, handling your banking and other finances \u2014 all moving into the digital world, and that also played out for Mollie.\n But that is also not the full story: growing at the same pace this year as last appears to indicate that even as we start to see more signs of the pandemic moving on (well, at least for some\u2026), the shift to paying and buying online (and using Mollie\u2019s rails to do so) will stay.\n \u201cThe only thing you can reliably measure in payments is consumer spend. That was at 10% and now it\u2019s at 15-20%,\u201d said  Shane Happach, who took over as CEO of Mollie in April of this year from founder Adriaan Mol (who, incidentally, was also the founder of MessageBird; Mol\u2019s knickname is Mollie, hence the name of this company).\n In an interview, Happach explained that consumer spend, and the subsequent addressable consumer market, is the metric that best indicates how a company like Mollie will grow. So while Mollie has largely been profitable since being founded back in 2004, the plan now will be to put the gas on growth, building related services around payments to continue expanding its product offering while also continuing to move move into more geographies beyond its core, and biggest, market of Europe, helped in no small part by its new, big investors.\n That will bring it into deeper competition with a whole raft of players. That is to say, Mollie is far from the only payments company on the market, nor is it the only one that has seen business boom in recent times. But it is bigger and much more fragmented than you might think. Happach \u2014 who spent a decade at WorldPay before joining Mollie \u2014 points out that the top ten players in payments have 50% of the market, but the other 50% is held by about 5,000 players.\n \u201cY ou\u2019d be really surprised, companies like Stripe are in the 5,000. They\u2019re not in the top ten,\u201d he said. (JP Morgan, WorldPay, Fiserv (First Data), PayPal are among those that make up the first ten.). That essentially gives the company a lot of opportunity to grow and consolidate, while also underscoring just how big the market is for everyone.\n Stripe came up a few times in our conversation, in particular when talking about competitive threats \u2014 its basic premise, like Mollie\u2019s, has been the building of a payments platform (complex for any non-payment company to do) that can be integrated by customers anywhere by way of a simple API; when talking about valuations (Stripe is  now valued at $95 billion); and when talking about product playbooks.\n In all cases, the main takeaway seems to be that Stripe\u2019s success speaks to the market Mollie has ahead of it. \u201cWe see a huge opportunity in the super underserved population of SMBs,\u201d Happach said. \u201cEspecially if you look at our core markets, where most of our customers come from today, the financial services that they can get access to are very clunky.\u201d The company, he added, will be focusing on a few areas that it believes it can do better than what\u2019s out there now, which also complements its payments business: working capital for small businesses, card issuing and corporate card programs, expense management, and business banking. (All areas, I should note, where Stripe also has launched products.)\n It will also be interesting to watch how and if Mollie, as it grows, gets more confident to potentially change its cut. It\u2019s taken PayPal years, but it has recently rebalanced its rates. Happach notes Mollie never has and  has no plans to follow it.\n One area where Mollie is less likely to invest the new capital is in acquisitions, however.\n \u201cI came from a company that had acquired a load of other companies, and I think there\u2019s pluses and minuses,\u201d Happach said. \u201cFor Mollie, we are building an organic plan\u2026.

the UK science minister, Amanda Solloway, said in a  statement.\n The  BBC reports Bezos has been an investor in General Fusion for over a decade, and the company raised $100 million in its latest funding round.\n Nuclear fusion is still an experimental energy source. It differs from nuclear fission, which is what modern nuclear power plants use to generate energy.\n     Whereas fission involves splitting atoms, fusion happens when two atoms collide and form one heavier atom. Commercially viable fusion has been highly sought after, as it would theoretically produce much more power than fission as well as far fewer radioactive byproducts.\n  Sign up for notifications from Insider!

\u21a9 ", "note_en": "The plot below shows the throughput of filling a region of the given size (varying on the x-axis) with zeros  1 on Skylake (and Ice Lake in the second tab).\n The two series were generated under apparently identical conditions: the same binary on the same machine. Only the date the benchmark was run varies. That is, on Tuesday (June 7th) filling with zeros is substantially faster than the same benchmark on Wednesday, at least when the region no longer fits in the L2 cache  2.\n   What\u2019s going on here? Are my Skylake and Ice Lake hosts simply work-weary by Wednesday and don\u2019t put in as much effort? Is there a new crypto-coin based on who can store the most zeros and this is a countermeasure to avoid ballooning CPU prices in the face of this new workload?\n  These hosts run Ubuntu 20.04 and on Wednesday June 8th an update to the  intel- microcode OS package was released. After a reboot  3, this loads the CPU with new   microcode that causes the behavior shown above. Specifically, this  microcode  4 disables the  hardware zero store optimization we discussed in a previous post. It was disabled to mitigate  CVE-2020-24512 further described  5 in Intel security advisory  INTEL-SA-00464.\n To be clear, I don\u2019t know  for sure that the  microcode disables the zero store optimization \u2013 but the evidence is rather overwhelming. After the update, performance is the same when filling zeros as for any other value, and the performance counters tracking L2 evictions suggestion that substantially all evictions are now non-silent (recall from the previous posts that silent evictions were a hallmark of the optimization).\n Although I suspect the performance impact will be minuscule on average  6, this surprise still serves as a reminder that raw CPU performance can  silently change due to  microcode updates and most Linux distributions and modern Windows have these updates enabled by default. We\u2019ve  seen this before. If you are trying to run reproducible benchmarks, you should always re-run your  entire suite in order to make accurate comparisons, even on the same hardware, rather than just running the stuff you think has changed.\n  In writing the earlier blog entries on this topic, I was interested in the  performance aspects of this optimization, not its potential as an attack vector. However, merely by observing (and publishing) the results, the optimization was affected:  the system under measurement changed as a result of the observation. I can\u2019t be sure that the optimization wouldn\u2019t have eventually been disabled anyway, but it does seem that the proximate cause this change to the  microcode was my earlier post.\n I am not convinced that removing any optimization which can be used in a timing-based side channel is sustainable. I am not sure this is a thread you want to keep pulling on: practically  every aspect of a modern CPU can vary in performance and timing based on internal state  7. Trying to draw the security boundaries tightly around co-located entities (e.g., processes on the same CPU, especially on the same core), without allowing any leaks seems destined to fail without a complete overhaul of CPU design, likely at the cost of a large amount of performance. There are just too many holes to plug.\n I hope that once the wave of vulnerabilities and disclosures that started with Meltdown and Spectre beings to recede, we can start to work on a measured approach to classifying and mitigating timing and other side-channel attacks. This could start by enumerating which performance characteristics are reasonable guaranteed to hold, and which aren\u2019t. For example, it could be specified whether memory access timing may vary based on the  value accessed. If it is allowed to vary, the zero store optimization would be allowed.\n In any case, I still plan to write about performance-related microarchitectural details. I just hope this outcome does not repeat itself.\n     If you have a question or any type of feedback, you can leave a  comment below.\n    Specifically, it uses   std::fill with a zero argument, with some inlining prevention, which ultimately results in a fill which uses a series of 32-byte vector loads and stores to store 256 bytes per unrolled iteration, with a loop body like this:\n  vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0x20 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0x40 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0x60 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0x80 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0xa0 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0xc0 ], ymm1 vmovdqu  YMMWORD  PTR  [ rax + 0xe0 ], ymm1\n  So the compiler does a good job: you can\u2019t ask for much better than that.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  I\u2019m doing a bit of a retcon here. The effect is present as described based on the date, and I observed and benchmarked it \u201con Wednesday\u201d, but the specific data series used for the plot were generated a week later when I had time to collect the data properly in a relatively noise free environment. So the two series were collected back-to-back on the same day, varying only the hidden parameter you\u2019ll learn about two paragraphs from now.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  To be clear, the  microcode is not persistent, so it needs to be loaded on  every boot. If you remove or downgrade the  intel-microcode package, you\u2019ll be back to an older  microcode after the next boot. That is, unless you also update your BIOS which can  also come with a  microcode update: this will be persistent unless you downgrade your BIOS.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  The new June 8th  microcode versions are  0xea for Skylake (versus  0xe2 previously) and  0xa6 for Ice Lake (versus  0xa0 previously).\u00a0 \u21a9\n    The performance regression shown in the plots is close to a worst case: the benchmark only fills zeros and nothing else. Real code doesn\u2019t spend  that much time filling zeros, although zero  is no doubt the dominant value in large block fills, at least because the OS must zero pages before returning them to user processes and memory-safe languages like Java will zero some objects and array types in bulk.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  This observation becomes almost universal once you consider that the  values involved in any operation affect power use (see e.g.  Sch\u00f6ne et al or  Cornebize and Legrand). Since power use can be directly (e.g., RAPL or external measurements) or indirectly (e.g., because of heat-dependent frequency changes) observed, it means that in theory  any operation, even those widely considered to be constant-time, may leak information.\u00a0 \u21a9", "posttime": "2021-06-22 15:00:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

some problems. Several Android users have taken to Twitter to  report that the Google app is crashing randomly on their phones.

Meanwhile, user reports suggest that the issue is affecting most Android phones including Sony, Samsung, Google Pixels, and more.\n Suddenly Google app has started crashing on my new pixel 4a  @Google  @GoogleIndia  #google  pic.twitter.com/WbR5Eln8Dm\n  The Google app crashing issue seems to stem from a recent update pushed out by the company. At our end, we experienced the issue on version 12.23.16.23.arm64 and 12.22.8.23 of the Google app. Some users have also reported app crashes on beta version 12.24.7.29.arm64 of the app. According to the Google app\u2019s Play Store listing, its versions can vary across different devices so you may be experiencing app crashes on a completely different version.\n Hi Maciej, sorry to know that you are experiencing an issue with your device. It\u2019s important that we get this sorted. Could you try a soft reboot by holding down the power button for 30 seconds and see if it works fine? Let us know if that helps. ^Adam\n  Responding to complaints on Twitter (see above), the official Made By Google account suggested a soft reboot of the phone. While the fix has worked for some users, others report that rebooting their phones hasn\u2019t helped.\n For us, uninstalling the latest update to the Google app fixed the problem. However, not everyone has been as lucky. A couple of users are still having trouble with the app even after rolling back to its previous version.\n Looks like we\u2019ll have to wait for Google to issue a more concrete fix and an explanation as to what\u2019s gone wrong. We\u2019ll update this article as and when we get more information.\n Back in March, an  issue with Android System WebView caused several Android apps to crash. While Google resolved it for those on stable Android versions, the problem seems to persist  for Android 12 Beta users. However, uninstalling and reinstalling WebView from the Google Play Store seems to resolve the problem for users.\n We don\u2019t think the latest Google app crashing problem is related to WebView issues. It\u2019s more likely a bug with the updated version of the app that Google will possibly iron out with another update. Until then, you can try uninstalling the Google app update by heading to  Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Google app &gt; three-dot menu &gt; Uninstall updates.

West. Streamed live on Twitter, Facebook Live, and Youtube embed, the show is then edited, sweetened with titles and music, and released on Techcrunch. It\u2019s a kind of hybrid between podcast, Zoom collaboration meeting, and work-from-anywhere encounter group. The Gang grew out of the early days of podcasting, now undergoing rescaffolding from social, drop-in, or just plain fast following from a variety of social networks. The latest entry, Live Audio Rooms from Facebook, is \u201csoft-launching\u201d with verified famous people and creators in good standing up first.\n Facebook typically waits just long enough to decide what features to copy, and appears ready to aggregate the strategies of the rest of the market behind a Facebook infrastructure if not firewall. This may incorporate not just social audio features like tipping and raising hands to speak but also live video streaming and perhaps screen-sharing tools like ones announced at Apple\u2019s WWDC for Facetime. Inevitably, the context returns to Clubhouse and its parallel tech media strategy.\n  Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) debuted their publishing site, and the media tried its best to push back without burning any bridges to the high-flying venture firm. Even more interesting than the future.com website was a Clubhouse Launch Party where we met authors and their editors for about two hours of chat. Marc Andreessen sat in at the beginning, and A16Z partner Margit Wennmachers provided context for the launch. The strategy: project trust and insight from a venture firm and go direct from technologists to the tech and investment audience. It\u2019s an interesting time in the wake of the Trumpian alternative facts blight, where the cable media seems tied in knots by trying to salvage ratings gold with yet another crisis-to-crisis breaking news schtick.\n After that gambit begins to tire, the pitch shifts to the undermining of Democracy by the Autocrats, which although real, is not exactly compelling ratings magic. With vaccinations reaching movie popcorn immunity levels, streaming television is shifting from all out binge releases to the much more familiar weekly cliffhanger model. Working from anywhere is being negotiated based on a hybrid of the best of watching your kids grow up while getting back to a collaborative office when you\u2019ve seen enough of them or them of you.\n On the Gang this time, Keith Teare suggests Netflix may be in a bit of a tough spot, as the easing pandemic puts pressure on new shows slowed down by production lockouts. It\u2019s true: the quality seems to be slipping almost imperceptibly, but nothing is accelerating to put pressure on the Big 4 or 5 Flixes including Disney, Amazon Prime, and maybe Hulu. DiscoBros (Frank Radice\u2019s catchy rebrand for Discovery/WarnerMedia) can be fun, Apple TV+ should buy in to boost production, and then we need to look to the Creator Economy to hurry up and save us.\n Every few days there\u2019s another social audio pivot/acquisition/update, the most interesting besides Facebook\u2019s if you can call it that being Spotify Greenroom with its auto record and captioning features and inevitable integration with its Anchor podcasting tools. Tip jar resistance is almost a thing, in case you\u2019re wondering. The only thing more enervating is speculation on whether Clubhouse is jumping the shark \u2014 I don\u2019t think so. If the Future.com suggests more copying of The Information\u2019s events model, there\u2019s plenty of runway ahead. And social audio gold is anything about Clubhouse on Clubhouse.\n For those of us who still remember tech news, the Apple announcements almost reach orbit with the mixture of M1 magic and iOS/MacOS/WatchOS/TVOS blurring. My favorite list is of features that don\u2019t show up on Intel machines, all the cool ones. For the first time in years, we traded up to M1\u2019s on both our Macbooks including a Pro and Air, and in the process enabled Blur mode on Zoom on both essentially for free. The hardware is starting to feel like a subscription service (HaaS) which as Salesforce\u2019s trajectory suggests is likely a very big deal. (Disclosure: I work for Salesforce.) For creators, moving from hardware like Newtek\u2019s Tricaster and BlackMagic\u2019s ATEM Mini to software-based OBS and then NDI5 over the public network is not prime time, but getting there real soon now.

The Vienna, Austria-based startup is now live in 18 countries and sees some 400,000 sessions booked monthly on its platform, up 700% year-on-year (and up 15% month-on-month). It says it is on track to double employees to 1,000 and reach 10,000 tutors by the end of this year.\u00a0The plan is to expand to more countries \u2014 Mexico and Canada are next on the list \u2014 and to continue growing its lists of tutors and subjects covered.\n  \u201cWe now plan to be even more aggressive geographically and plan to invest more into the brand,\u201d Felix Ohswald, cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch.\n  DST Global is leading the round, with SoftBank (via its Vision Fund 2), Tencent, Dragoneer and previous backers Coatue, Left Lane Capital and DN Capital also participating. Vienna, Austria-based GoStudent has raised \u20ac291 million to date, including a  \u20ac70 million round only this past March and  \u20ac13.3 million in a Series A this past November.\n The rapid pace of funding and GoStudent\u2019s rising valuation \u2014 this investment makes it the highest-valued edtech startup in Europe, the company said \u2014 comes amid a streak of funding rounds for edtech companies.\n And that may be no surprise: online and other digital tools in the last year especially felt more relevant (and in many cases were used more) than ever before due to social distancing during the pandemic. (Other recent deals have included funding for  Byju\u2019s,  Kahoot,  Formative,  Engageli,  Lingoda,  Brainly,  ClassDojo,  Newsela, and  Yuanfudao, among many others.)\n But in the case of GoStudent, it\u2019s also because the startup itself is also doing an A+ job in scaling its concept.\n The company has been around since 2016 \u2014 when it started out initially providing a network for people to help each other answer questions (similar to Brainly), as well as connect with tutors, and for tutors to organize classes \u2014 but it was only about 2.5 years ago that GoStudent started to focus more squarely on one-to-one tutoring.\n GoStudent provides a fully-integrated service, which lets students and their parents select from a range of topics that are typically taught in schools \u2014 currently some 30 subjects, including sciences, math, computing, languages, history, business and more \u2014 that they can be tutored on generally or specifically with the aim of taking an exam.\n Tutoring comes from people who are tested, vetted and interviewed by GoStudent before they can join the platform; and before engaging tutors, parents and students interview an individual tutor and go through a practice lesson as part of that.\n Learning plans are then organized according to students\u2019 schedules and what they are setting out to do (they can send over their homework, or chapters they\u2019re studying in school or even a curriculum outline); and the classes, assessments and  payments (based on packages booked), are all handled over the platform, too.\n Although there are a number of ways of learning a subject over the internet today \u2014 and specifically a number of online-only direct tutoring platforms in the market now (including Brainly, Yuanfudao, and others) \u2014 Ohswald said that by and large GoStudent\u2019s biggest competition is the bigger in-person business of teaching, and of students and tutors connecting with each other through word of mouth \u2014 the \u201coffline shadow market of tutors,\u201d as he calls it.\n All the same, while there are tech tools involved in provisioning and running lessons, at its heart GoStudent is also still about humans connecting to help each other, rather than humans connecting with computer programs.\n Interestingly, its founders believe that the Covid-19 pandemic effect was not uniformly positive for its business.\n \u201cThe pandemic had mixed effects,\u201d Ohswald said. \u201cOn the one hand there was a natural demand from kids and parents. But with the schools closed, there was less pressure, less exams, less demand for after-school study. That aspect had a negative effect. But more broadly, there was a BIG boost for digital education. So the mindset of the parent and family drastically shifted.\u201d\n He noted that many families turned to tutoring to help \u201csupport the kids at home, to help them to stop being overwhelmed.\u201d (And I would add, especially in the first part of the lockdown last year when schools were scrambling a little to regroup and teach online, that as a parent, we found it a relief to have at least some consistency with private tutors online at that time.)\n What that means, essentially, is that while GoStudent did well in the last year, the company does not want to tie its growth to a specific set of pandemic circumstances that may well become less of an issue in the year ahead.\n Indeed, for better or worse, there  are bigger factors at play that predate the pandemic. Increasing pressure on students to perform their best competing against others, a continuing focus on testing, and a general level of academic ambition; but also a much easier and cheaper way of finding and connecting with people who can help students feel more supported in their efforts: all of these are also playing a role.\n \u201cGoStudent is one of the fastest growing companies that we have ever backed. The company has grown 800% in terms of revenue and 70x in terms of value since 2020 and we are convinced that this is just the beginning,\u201d Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, DN Capital, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe believe that GoStudent can become one of the top digital schools in the world.

Best  communication of the idea wins, as do the people behind them.\u00a0\u00a0  The most powerful communication tool might be a snappy meme these days, but in business, it\u2019s still the written word. Writing well supercharges your trajectory. Yet great writing is rare. Why?   Turns out we\u2019ve been taught some things that simply don\u2019t apply:\n  Writing well lifts many boats: emails, scoping docs, strategy docs, analysis, resumes. We\u2019ll cover how to rescue bad writing, then how to upgrade from good to great.\u00a0 \u200d\n  What\u2019s the biggest difference between great writers and all the rest? It\u2019s not talent, it\u2019s treating the process like a product.     Your reader is your customer. Your first draft is pre-MVP. To get to a quality shippable version, you need to iterate, aka edit.\u00a0  Amount of editing time depends on importance and length. A status update might require 10 minutes, but a strategy doc closer to a few days.\u00a0\u00a0  Your first draft is your R&amp;D: get ideas on paper and clarify your thinking. Your subsequent drafts are marketing: edit from your reader\u2019s perspective to make your points persuasive. \u200d\n  Bad writing is hard to follow because it\u2019s stream-of-consciousness which tends to leap around. Ironically, the magic of creative thinking comes from leaping and making unexpected connections. But to be appreciated for its brilliance, creative thinking needs to be  translated into coherent writing.\n  Ideas are generated bottom-up and sometimes sideways, but they need to be communicated top-down. \u00a0  Coherence starts with making your point upfront. If your goal is to solve a problem, start with stating it simply (e.g., sign-up conversion dropped to all-time low of 2%). If your goal is to provide an update, start with the most important change.\u00a0  Answer the question:  why should I continue reading this? People need context, but before that, they need to know why they should care.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Bad writing is logically unsound. The points are disconnected from each other.   Example: we have low retention, so we should email more \u2014 this might help, might hurt; impossible to know until you define retention, diagnose the root of the problem and review impact of existing emails on retention. \u00a0  Your points should fit like a jigsaw puzzle, each connected to another. \u00a0  Read like a skeptic.  Ask:  So what? How is this related? Does this make sense? at every turn. The clearer your writing, the fewer interruptions need to be made downstream in the form of meetings and back-and-forths. Clarity gives you leverage.  More questions worth asking, inspired by  this Tweet thread:\n    A classic lesson from consulting 101 is to expect that your reader is busy.\u00a0Use headers,  selective bolding and bullets to make your message loud and clear. When you make it skimmable, it\u2019s more likely to be read in full.\u00a0   Easy on the eyes, not an intimidating wall of text:\n    Every word should serve a purpose. Every sentence should make you want to read the next one.  Prime darlings to kill: words that are redundant and weak.\u00a0   Redundant words say the same thing twice. Examples: \u201cnew invention, \u201crival competitor\u201d, \u201cactual fact\u201d, \u201cvery unique\u201d, \u201call throughout\u201d. They bore your reader and bloat your writing.   Weak words lack meaning and specificity. If it\u2019s not moving your argument forward, it\u2019s holding it back. Examples: \u201cnice\u201d, \u201creally\u201d, \u201cvery\u201d, \u201cthing\u201d, \u201camazing\u201d\u00a0  At this point, you\u2019ll reach a good baseline. To get to great, we need some extra spice. \u200d\n  A well-known storytelling rule: use \u201cbut and therefore\u201d instead of \u201cand then\u201d to create action and tension. This same principle helps you tease out nuance.  \u200d\n Version A: \u201cWe want the customer to feel X, but right now they struggle with Y, therefore we need Z\u201d.\u00a0   Version B: \u201cWe want the customer to feel X, and also they struggle with Y, and by the way, we need Z\u201d.\n Version A gives you the space to diagnose the struggle, and lay out cause and effect. It frames the narrative persuasively. Version B throws too many seemingly unrelated things together. It puts the burden on the reader to untangle what\u2019s really going on.\u00a0   Not surprisingly,  people who use \u201cbut and therefore\u201d tend to be perceived as more senior than those who use the more simplistic \u201cand then\u201d. Framing matters. \u200d\n  Clear and concise writing gets you access to the mind, but color and emotion gets you access to the heart. To make people excited to act, paint a vivid picture of what can be created.\u00a0\u00a0  Customer quotes underscoring the pain of the present are a great starting point. Then bring in colorful details of what they can feel and become as a result:\n We are asking a lot from our customers.\u00a0We are asking them to spend hours a day in a new and unfamiliar application, to give up on years or even decades of experience using email for work communication\u2026   To get people to say yes to a request that large, we need to (1) offer them a reward big enough to justify their effort and (2) do an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution.   The best way to imagine the reward is thinking about who we want our customers to become: \u200d \u2022 We want them to become masters of their own information and not slaves, overwhelmed by the neverending flow.  \u2022 We want them to feel less frustrated by a lack of visibility into what is going on with their team. \u2022 We want them to become people who communicate purposefully, knowing that each question they ask is actually building value for the whole team.  \u200dSource:  Slack CEO\n Another approach is to name your future customers and describe how your product enhances their life. Work backwards from the future.  \u200d\n  Neil deGrasse Tyson is a delight to listen to. His secret: he\u2019s written down pretty much everything he says in public.  By battle-testing words on paper first, Neil is far more eloquent when he speaks.\u00a0   You can do the same. The cycle of writing and editing prepares you for real-time moments in interviews and meetings especially if charisma doesn\u2019t come naturally.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Writing is  the meta-skill of modern business. Easy writing makes for hard reading, so instead of aiming for easy, invest in the process of editing.   Start with unrestrained creation, and end with ruthless deletion until there is nothing more to take away. \u200d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 14:05:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5bf9\u5f85,writing,\u9700\u8981", "title": "\u50cf\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u4f60\u7684\u5199\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Treat your writing like a product", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.productlessons.xyz/article/improve-business-writing-skills-with-examples", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bf9\u5f85", "writing", "\u9700\u8981"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b7a4d301ac6e3791bdb6168ee2b80349.png", "infoid": 1067368, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4e3a\u6211\u7684IB\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u51b3\u8d5b\u5199\u4e86\u4e00\u7bc7\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u7531\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u7ecf\u7406\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u6211\u4ece\u6211\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n \u4e00\u5982\u65e2\u5f80\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u4f60\u53ea\u662f\u6709\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u4e0e\u6211\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\n    \u514d\u8d39\u8f6f\u4ef6\u514d\u82b1\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u4e2d - \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u90e8\uff0c\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4eba\u5458\u719f\u6089\u81ea\u7531\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4f46\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\uff1f\u514d\u8d39\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08\u6216FOSS\uff09\u662f\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u4e0b\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6700\u5927\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u4e00\u662fLinux\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7Linux\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u652f\u6301ChromeoS\uff0cAndroid\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5927\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\uff0339;

It&#39;s heavily inspired by the Freakonomics movie. I&#39;ve made minimal changes from the version I submitted.\n As always, if something is wrong or you just have an opinion to share, feel free to  contact me.\n    Free software\u2014free as in freedom\u2014is a cornerstone of the current software environment. Most, if not all, of the apps people are familiar with use code from free software. But what even is free software? Free open-source software (or FOSS) is software whose code is publicly available under a license that allows the use of the code in your projects. One of the largest FOSS projects in the world is the Linux kernel, which is freely available. You might not have heard of the Linux kernel, but it is the software that powers ChromeOS, Android, most IoT devices, and the majority of the world&#39;s servers. It is only alive because of the millions of dollars in donations it receives from companies which depend on the software. However, there are pieces of FOSS software that someone has been thanklessly maintaining for decades with no pay.\n  This is clearly an issue. The current state of software is such that everything depends on everything else. If one essential component ceases to be maintained, or is sold to another (more malicious) actor, the software which depends on it will break. So how do we prevent this? FOSS is typically created by individuals, not by corporations (although there is a shift toward FOSS companies), and since the software is free, you can not sell or license it to make money.\n  The developer is bored of the project and does not want to keep on supporting it, since it was originally a passion or a school project.\n The project has gotten out of hand and is really large, so it is difficult to maintain.\n The project&#39;s main users are people who are not particularly computer literate, therefore there is an abundance of support requests that would be considered idiotic (lack of patience).\n There is a better alternative available so the developer stops working on the current project.\n  The developer&#39;s priorities may shift away from the project and toward work or something else.\n Each and every one of these reasons has already happened in real life and caused issues for consumers. One perfect example is the \u201cThe Great Suspender\u201d fiasco. The FOSS extension was sold to another person who uploaded a malicious version of the program to Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store. This caused a mass exodus from the extension subsequently leading to the extension not being used. The source code for the program has not been updated since October of 2020 and the extension has been pulled from the store. The school had approved of this extension for use, and it still failed since there was no real incentive to not sell the program.\n So how does this relate to economics? It is clear that FOSS has a massive social benefit, but the private benefit to the developer is very low. Therefore,  incentives matter. In order for the developers to continue their projects, they must have an incentive to do so. Currently, for smaller projects, the incentive is a sense of obligation the developers have to their users. Naturally, the developers do not want to abandon their users, but a situation may arise that a proper incentive would fix. Therefore, by donating money to developers, you prevent the project from being abandoned. Some people have a large salary from their open source projects, such as the Haxx team which created the  de facto HTTP client library that is used across every platform. They have many sponsors because these sponsors realize that if this project goes under, so does the company&#39;s software. Unfortunately, it is common that only the larger projects are funded to the point where the developers can make aliving off of it.\n Along with incentives mattering, one of the incentives listed earlier included how technology could change, leading to the depreciation of a project. The  technological change especially in the software industry, leads to shifts in popular software. One notable exception is the C programming language, which has been around since 1972 and is still the number one choice for high-performance or systems applications (although this paradigm has been shifting slightly toward the Rust programming language). With the introduction of new languages, such as Rust, many developers decide to rewrite their projects (see the RIIR movement), or create a new one entirely. A real-world example of technological change would be something like Adobe Flash. Technologies like JavaScript and WASM depreciated Flash, leading to legacy Flash programs being unavailable to people today. Movements have been made to archive the Flash programs, but all of the software that had to do with Flash (and the few companies that depend on Flash still) were left out in the rain.\n Technological change is linked with  competition and efficacy, since with the shifts in technology, new programs rise as well. In the late 1980&#39;s, the open-source kernel of choice was GNU Hurd. However, with the release of the Linux kernel in the early 1990&#39;s, GNU Hurd was driven out as a viable choice and now is delegated to experimentalists and enthusiasts. This open source project has still been kept alive by a small but dedicated group of people. There has still been no official stable release and the time between code changes is typically weeks.Competition typically leads to a shift in consumer tastes, so the  supply, demand, and equilibrium price changes as well. In terms of free software, the price is zero, so theoretically demand should be infinite. This is not the case, with non-free software still dominating on some platforms, such asWindows, MacOS, and so on.\n  Therefore, there must be some costs to the software beyond monetary costs that we must account for. Many FOSS projects require a higher learning curve and implementation costs than popular non-free alternatives. A wonderful example of this is Microsoft Word. The leading FOSS alternative to Word is LibreOffice Writer. Writer has many issues, such as compatibility problems with DOCX files, lack of features, and difficulty of use. So, there is an implicit \u201ccost\u201d of using FOSS, or with using anything for that matter. The other important part of the graph is the supply curve. There are two possibilities for the supply curve: perfectly inelastic (as outlined in figure 1.1), representing that the developers are willing to accept any money but that will not change how much software is released. But this runs into another issue with the supply and demand graph: software is free to download, and you can copy it for free. Therefore, there is an infinite supply of the software, but not an infinite quantity supplied, since that must be at an equilibrium point. So what could cause the supply and demand to shift? Again, a shift in consumer tastes, a change in the inputs for production (more developers working on a project), or any other economic concept, proving that free stuff still has to abide by the laws of supply and demand.\n Linked perfectly with supply / demand and consumer tastes,  the \u201csnob effect\u201d in consumer purchasing is a major player in software. With such a wide diversity in software, people who use one program are viewed as \u201cbetter\u201d than people who use another. A perfect example of this is Apple. Apple&#39;s MacOS (which you can only legally receive with an Apple computer) is considered the \u201csnob\u201d of the operating systems, while those who use Linux or another more niche product are considered to be nerds. People pay top dollar to not use free software because if it is free, it is seen as being a second-rate, inferior product. FOSS projects fail because they are seen as second-rate to an already-existing non-free product. In July of 2000, Microsoft&#39;s CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \u201ccommunism\u201d:\n [T]o emphasise the competitive threat, and in some senses the competitive opportunity, that Linux represents. Linux is a tough competitor. There&#39;s no company called Linux, there&#39;s barely a Linux road map. Yet Linux sort of springs organically from the earth. And it had, you know, the characteristics of communism that people love so very, very much about it. That is, it&#39;s free.\n For more than the next decade, Microsoft continued to make Linux seem as a second rate product that only nerds and communists use, cementing Windows&#39;s position as expensive but the best, similarly to Apple&#39;s products. Ballmer also called the free-software movement and Linux \u201ccancer\u201d the next year. All of this naturally shifted demand left via the \u201csnob effect\u201d and set the community back a decade.\n  So what do we do in order to incentivise developers to continue their essential projects? Simple: we give them money. As stated earlier, the marginal social benefit is much higher than the marginal private benefit. Therefore, if MPB is increased so that it equals MSB, society is better off.\n  In figure 3.1, we see the current situation. Society is better off than the developer, so there is a deadweight loss (in red). To move MPB to MSB, we pay the developer. In fact, others have already thought of this idea. GitHub, the leader in open-source software hosting, has implemented a feature called \u201cSponsors\u201d in which a person or a company can sponsor a GitHub organization or individual. GitHub takes no cut. This is suitable for small and large scale products and replaces similar methods such as a Patreon or a simple Paypal transfer. Another method that can be used is an official sponsorship. Because companies use some of the FOSS code, they want it to continue, so they sponsor the project. For example, Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution that is built to replace CentOS. They have gotten sponsors because the companies want a replacement for CentOS. Lastly, there is the sellout option. Selling the software to a third party would only temporarily increase MPB to equal MSB. At that point the software would fail, as it did with the Great Suspender. So where does that leave developers? It is difficult to get funding from individuals since people usually do not want to pay money. This follows that, if the developers want to make money from their FOSS projects, they will make something worth donating to.\n    Lea, Graham. \u201cMS&#39; Ballmer: Linux Is Communism.\u201d The Register, 21 May 2000, https://www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/ms_ballmer_linux_is_communism/.

", "note_en": "Tesla has unveiled its new supercomputer, which is already the fifth most powerful in the world, and it\u2019s going to be the predecessor of Tesla\u2019s upcoming new Dojo supercomputer.\n It is being used to train the neural nets powering Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and upcoming self-driving AI.\n  Over the last few years, Tesla has had a clear focus on computing power both inside and outside its vehicles.\n Inside, it needs computers powerful enough to run its self-driving software, and outside, it needs supercomputers to train its self-driving software powered by neural nets that are fed an insane amount of data coming from the fleet.\n CEO Elon Musk has been teasing Tesla\u2019s Dojo project, which apparently  consists of a supercomputer capable of an\u00a0exaFLOP,\u00a0one quintillion (10 18) floating-point operations per second, or 1,000 petaFLOPS \u2013 making it one of the most powerful computers in the world.\n Tesla has been working on Dojo for the last few years, and Musk has been hinting that it should be ready by the end of this year.\n But the company has developed other supercomputers on its way to Dojo, and now Andrej Karpathy, Tesla\u2019s head of AI, has unveiled the latest one during a presentation at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\n During the presentation, Karpathy gave a shoutout to Tesla\u2019s supercomputing team and showcased their latest work, Tesla\u2019s third supercomputer cluster:\n  Tesla is claiming some fairly insane specs on this new cluster, which should make it roughly the fifth most-powerful computer in the world:\n   \u201cWe have a neural net architecture network and we have a data set, a 1.5 petabytes data set that requires a huge amount of computing. So I wanted to give a plug to this insane supercomputer that we are building and using now. For us, computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and what enables Autopilot. And for that to work really well, we need to master the data from the fleet, and train massive neural nets and experiment a lot. So we invested a lot into the compute. In this case, we have a cluster that we built with 720 nodes of 8x A100 of the 80GB version. So this is a massive supercomputer. I actually think that in terms of flops, it\u2019s roughly the number 5 supercomputer in the world.\u201d\n The Tesla engineer didn\u2019t want to elaborate on project Dojo, but he did say that it will be an even better supercomputer optimized for neural net training than Tesla\u2019s current cluster.\n Musk also previously said that Tesla plans to eventually\u00a0 make its supercomputers available to other companies in order for them to train their neural nets on it.\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.
