On board the repatriation flight VN409 were 403 Vietnamese citizens—including 41 unaccompanied babies, who were being sent back to the country without their parents.</p><p>越南胡志明市-2020年9月5日，一架波音787梦幻客机从韩国仁川国际机场起飞，飞往越南。遣返航班VN409上有403名越南公民，其中包括41名无人陪伴的婴儿，这些婴儿被送回该国而没有父母。</p><p> Waiting at the Ho Chi Minh City airport for one of the babies was Nguyen Hoa My, who had set off at 2 a.m. that same morning from her home in northern Vietnam, in order to meet up with the flight from Seoul and retrieve her granddaughter.</p><p> Nguyen Hoa My在胡志明市机场等着一个婴儿，她于当日早上2点从她在越南北部的家中出发，目的是与从首尔的航班会面并找回她的孙女。</p><p> The flight from South Korea was delayed by almost two hours. “Airport officials said the papers of two babies had gotten lost and there was a last-minute scramble to sort out the paperwork back in Seoul, which led to the delay,” Nguyen recalls. “I thought I would be able to see the baby immediately, but I was told I wouldn’t be allowed through. At that point, I didn’t yet know which quarantine center they were all heading to, but another grandmother received a tip-off and so we made our way over to Bau Bang together.”</p><p> 从韩国出发的航班延误了近两个小时。 Nguyen回忆说：“机场官员说，两个婴儿的文件已经丢失，在最后一刻争先恐后地将文件整理回首尔，这导致了延误。” “我以为我可以立即见到婴儿，但被告知我不会被允许通过。那时我还不知道他们都去哪一个检疫中心，但是另一个祖母收到了小费，所以我们一起去了邦邦。</p><p>  It was dusk by the time the women finally arrived. The place was already crowded, and the weather had given way to thick grey clouds and rain, reflecting their mood. “They were only letting people through in twos,” says Nguyen. They were each asked to pay the equivalent of $200 to cover the costs of quarantine. In line with the country’s COVID-19 protocol, everyone heading into quarantine was promptly tested upon arrival, with all samples coming back negative.</p><p>  妇女们终于到了，那是黄昏。这个地方已经人满为患，天气逐渐转为浓密的灰色云层和雨水，反映出他们的心情。 Nguyen说：“他们只是让人们一举两得。”他们被要求每人支付相当于200美元的隔离费。根据该国的COVID-19协议，到达隔离区的每个人都应在到达时及时进行测试，所有样本均呈阴性。</p><p> As the hours went by, courtesy was in short supply. Exhausted family members, many having traveled long distances, were desperate to see their tiny relatives. “There were no manners; everyone wanted to go first. We arrived around 6 p.m., but it wasn&#39;t until 11:30 p.m. that I was finally able to see my grandchild,” says Nguyen.</p><p> 随着时间的流逝，礼貌性不足。精疲力竭的家庭成员，其中许多人长途跋涉，迫切希望见到他们的小亲戚。 “没有礼貌；每个人都想先走。我们大约在下午6点到达，但直到晚上11:30才到。我终于能够见到我的孙子。”阮说。</p><p>  “I went running in and that’s when I heard Mai crying, but before I could pick her up I was escorted back out the room again. That was the first time I saw her; she was upset, which set me off. She’d had such a long day traveling, not being able to hold her when she most needed it was upsetting,” she says, recalling their first-ever encounter.</p><p>  “我跑进去，那是我听到麦在哭的时候，但是在我能接她之前，我再次被护送回房间。那是我第一次见到她。她很沮丧，这让我兴奋。她旅行了很长的一天，无法在最需要的时候抱着她，这让他很沮丧。”她回忆起他们的第一次相遇时说。</p><p> When Nguyen was finally allowed through to the isolation ward, her hopes of being able to reassure her granddaughter soon gave way to the realization that the 6-month-old, who was born in Korea and whom she had never met before, felt no greater comfort in her arms than she did being held by a random member of staff.</p><p> 当阮终于被允许进入隔离病房时，她希望能够向孙女放心的希望很快就让位给了一个认识，即六个月大的孩子出生于韩国，她从未见过面，但现在再也感觉不到与被随机的职员抓住相比，她的手臂感到舒适。 </p><p> “I was a stranger to her. I didn’t know my grandchild and she didn’t know me,” says Nguyen.</p><p>“我对她是一个陌生人。我不认识我的孙子，她也不认识我。”阮说。</p><p> “Compared to many others, we were lucky. Some babies didn’t settle at all that night,” she adds.</p><p> “与其他许多人相比，我们很幸运。她补充说：“那天晚上有些婴儿根本没有安顿下来。”</p><p> Indeed, it took up to a week for some of the infants to settle down, while their new guardians waited to take them home from quarantine. One doctor at the Bau Bang quarantine center, which deals with overseas returnees, told me: “The first five days were the worst, certainly the most distressing for the babies, with some even refusing to eat, which made it hard for everyone.”</p><p> 的确，其中一些婴儿需要长达一周的时间才能安顿下来，而他们的新监护人则等待将他们从隔离区带回家。包邦检疫中心的一位医生与海外回返者打交道，他告诉我：“前五天对婴儿来说是最糟糕的，当然是最令人难过的，甚至有的孩子拒绝进食，这使每个人都很难。”</p><p> The quarantine center staff were also caught off guard by the sheer number of lone infants, many of whom were no older than 6 months, some not yet weaned. Over the first 24 hours, a steady trickle of grandmothers, aunts, and the odd uncle, began to pour into the center, as news of the babies’ arrival and their whereabouts began to filter out.</p><p> 隔离中心的工作人员也为孤单的婴儿而感到措手不及，其中许多婴儿的年龄不超过6个月，有些还没有断奶。在开始的24小时内，随着婴儿的到来及其下落的消息逐渐被过滤，奶奶，姑姑和叔叔的steady流开始涌入中心。</p><p> As staff waited for the infants’ families, the Bau Bang District center was seized by a cacophony of crying babies, their sobs ringing down vast and vacant hallways.</p><p> 当工作人员在等待婴儿的家时，鲍邦区中心被哭闹的婴儿们吵得一团糟，他们的抽泣声遍及空旷的走廊。</p><p>  Why were so many infants being sent to Vietnam without their parents in the first place?</p><p>  为什么这么多婴儿首先被送去越南而没有父母呢？</p><p> What follows is a tale of personal sacrifice, made more difficult by the pandemic, and the quest for social mobility that sees many people leaving Vietnam’s provinces to seek opportunities abroad, often illegally. But with Vietnam among only a handful of countries expected to see positive economic growth this year, there’s a question of whether such sacrifices are even still necessary.</p><p> 接下来的故事是个人牺牲的故事，大流行使这项工作变得更加困难，而对社会流动的追求使许多人离开越南各省，往往是非法地在国外寻找机会。但是，由于只有少数几个国家预计今年的经济将实现积极增长，因此存在这样的问题，即是否仍然有必要做出这样的牺牲。 </p><p> Shortly after September’s repatriation flight, a handful of articles appeared in local state-run media. One  article explained the parents were unable to accompany the children “due to challenges posed by the pandemic”;  another spoke of their “financial hardships,” with the parents described as “mostly low-income workers.” The head of the quarantine center went a step further and was  quoted saying the parents were obliged to stay behind to complete their work contracts in South Korea.</p><p>9月的遣返飞行后不久，当地官方媒体刊登了几篇文章。一篇文章解释说，“由于流行病带来的挑战”，父母无法陪伴孩子。另一位谈到他们的“财务困难”，父母形容为“大多数是低收入工人”。检疫中心负责人走得更远，据称父母必须留在韩国完成他们的工作合同。</p><p>  One senior staff member at Bau Bang told me the babies were sent back to Vietnam “for their own safety,” after daily COVID-19 infections in South Korea peaked at  441 in late August—at the time, the biggest single-day hike since March. (Thanks to measures like the strict 14-day quarantine for returnees, Vietnam has been one of the most COVID-resilient countries on the planet. At the time of writing, this Southeast Asian country of 96 million people had announced its first confirmed case of community transmission in almost three months, taking Vietnam’s COVID-19 tally to 1,339 infections and 35 deaths. By contrast, American deaths had surpassed 267,000 and infections more than 13.4 million.)</p><p>  Bau Bang的一名高级职员告诉我，为了安全起见，婴儿被送回越南。在韩国，每天的COVID-19感染率在8月下旬达到441例的峰值，当时是自2009年以来最大的单日加息游行。 （由于采取了严格的回返者14天隔离措施等措施，越南一直是地球上对COVID最具弹性的国家之一。在撰写本文时，这个拥有9600万人的东南亚国家宣布了首例确诊的在近三个月的时间里，社区传播，使越南的COVID-19总数达到1339例感染和35例死亡。相比之下，美国的死亡人数超过26.7万，感染人数超过1340万。）</p><p> While coronavirus fears may have been a contributing factor in returning some of the infants, all the families I spoke to claimed that most of the babies’ parents could not have returned even if they had wanted to (though none did), because of their irregular status. Officially, seats on Vietnamese repatriation flights are only offered to citizens with a legal right to be overseas.</p><p> 尽管对冠状病毒的恐惧可能是导致某些婴儿返回的一个促成因素，但我与之交谈的所有家庭都声称，即使他们愿意，大多数婴儿的父母也无法返回（尽管没有回返），因为他们的不规律状态。正式而言，越南归国航班的座位仅提供给具有合法出国权利的公民。</p><p> Between the news reports linking the repatriation of the unaccompanied babies to the economic fallout from the coronavirus, and those suggesting that health concerns had spurred parents to take drastic action, none told the full story.</p><p> 在有关将无人陪伴的婴儿遣返与冠状病毒造成的经济后果联系起来的新闻报道与暗示健康问题促使父母采取严厉行动的报道之间，没有人说完整的故事。</p><p>   Outside, a man with a soldering gun is installing a metal wire fence around the perimeter of the yard “to keep the children from running out into the road,” Tran says, a baby in her arms as she sees me arrive.</p><p>   特兰说，在外面，一个拿着焊枪的人正在院子周围安装金属丝栅栏，“以防止孩子们跑出马路。”</p><p> The house sits on a busy thoroughfare, frequented by lorries, at the periphery of a nondescript village a few hours’ drive from Hanoi.</p><p> 这座房子坐落在繁忙的街道上，在河边几小时车程外的一个不起眼的村庄外围，经常有卡车出没。</p><p> A jumble of plastic loafers and sandals greet us on the steps leading inside. I take off my shoes and I’m ushered through to the living area, where a young boy and girl, startled by my arrival, seek refuge behind their grandmother’s back.</p><p> 一堆塑料便鞋和凉鞋迎接我们通往内部的台阶。我脱下鞋子，然后步入起居区，在那里，一个年轻的男孩和女孩对我的到来感到震惊，他们在祖母的背后寻求庇护。 </p><p> By anyone’s standards, the house is spacious and comfortable. Vietnamese Peppa Pig plays on a large flat screen TV. Photos of deceased loved ones watch over the family from their position atop a large altar, alongside a potpourri of incense, plastic flowers and ancestral offerings including platefuls of fruit and cake.</p><p>按照任何人的标准，房子宽敞舒适。越南小猪佩奇猪在大型平面电视上播放。死去的亲人的照片从他们在大祭坛上的位置照看整个家庭，旁边是香熏，塑料花和祖先奉献的杂物，包括一盘水果和蛋糕。</p><p> “Things weren’t always like this; I was very poor before,” says Tran, as she balances her 10-month-old granddaughter on her knee.</p><p> “事情并不总是这样。以前我很穷，” Tran说道，她平衡了10个月大的孙女的膝盖。</p><p> When her children were at high school, Tran had taken part in an export labor program, spending six years as a domestic helper for a family in Cyprus. The savings from that job helped build this large property.</p><p> 当她的孩子上高中时，Tran参加了一项出口劳工计划，在塞浦路斯为一个家庭的家庭帮佣度过了六年。这项工作节省下来的钱帮助建造了这座大型地产。</p><p> If Tran’s is the house that immigration built, illegal migration turned it into a home.</p><p> 如果Tran的房子是移民建造的房屋，则非法移民将其变成了房屋。</p><p>  After her daughter Ngo Thanh Binh’s first marriage broke down, she decided to go in search of work abroad.</p><p>  女儿Ngo Thanh Binh的初婚破裂后，她决定去国外寻找工作。</p><p> “We heard about communities in nearby communes whose family members had left Vietnam and found success elsewhere. We asked around and eventually we were given the contact details of the people who helped Ngo secure a tourist visa to South Korea,” says Tran.</p><p> “我们听说附近社区的社区，其家庭成员已离开越南，并在其他地方找到了成功。我们四处询问，最终我们得到了帮助Ngo获得前往韩国旅游签证的人员的详细联系方式，” Tran说。</p><p> Their “help” set the family back more than $10,000, paid for through bank loans and by pooling the family’s finances.</p><p> 他们的“帮助”使整个家庭的收入超过了10,000美元，这些收入是通过银行贷款和汇总家庭财务来支付的。 </p><p> “When my daughter heard how easy it was to make money there, it motivated her to go herself. It was either that or farming,” she says, convinced the choice is a binary one.</p><p>“当我的女儿得知在那里赚钱很容易时，这促使她自己去了。她说，确信选择是二元选择。</p><p> Despite the hefty price tag, the money they handed over was only enough to secure the visa. As far as logistics and getting past security was concerned, Ngo was on her own. “The flight itself was paid separately. Once in Seoul airport, she had to go through to the other side by herself, nobody helped her with that. If officials had decided to stop her and send her home, we would have lost everything. It’s the same as gambling, it’s a risky business: go big or go home,” says Tran.</p><p> 尽管价格高昂，但他们交出的钱仅足以确保签证。关于物流和超越安全性，Ngo独自一人。 “航班本身是单独支付的。到达首尔机场后，她必须独自走到另一边，没有人帮助她。如果官员们决定阻止她并把她送回家，我们将失去一切。这与赌博一样，是一项冒险的生意：变大还是回家，” Tran说。</p><p> “If you’re lucky, you get away with it, but there are no guarantees — like the container in England,” she adds, her voice trailing off.</p><p> 她补充道：“如果幸运的话，您可以摆脱困境，但并不能保证-就像英格兰的集装箱一样。”</p><p> Tran is referring to last year’s  Essex lorry tragedy, in which 39 undocumented Vietnamese nationals were found dead after being smuggled into Britain in the back of a lorry. The trial of four suspects implicated in their deaths is currently underway in the United Kingdom.</p><p> 特兰（Tran）指的是去年的埃塞克斯（Essex）卡车悲剧，其中39名无证越南人在卡车后面被偷运到英国后被发现死亡。英国目前正在对涉嫌死亡的四名嫌疑人进行审判。</p><p> The night that Ngo “made her escape,” as her mother puts it, a lost phone charger meant she was unable to make contact with her parents until the early hours. The message, when it came, read: “Mom, I made it.”</p><p> 正如母亲所说，在Ngo“逃脱”的那晚，丢失的手机充电器意味着她直到凌晨才与父母取得联系。该消息到达时显示为：“妈妈，我做到了。”</p><p> According to Tran, the idea to leave for South Korea was Ngo’s alone: “Nobody encouraged her to go, because we all know the risks,” she says.</p><p> 她说，离开韩国去的想法是Ngo一个人的：“没有人鼓励她走，因为我们都知道风险，”她说。</p><p> Despite not speaking the language, Ngo found work almost immediately. “For the first two years, it was challenging. She was just about earning enough to pay back her debts and cover her outgoings and other basic needs. Initially, she found work at a frozen food plant, peeling prawns, but the temperatures were so low that even with her overalls, she complained about being cold all the time,” says Tran.</p><p> 尽管不讲这种语言，但Ngo几乎立即找到了工作。 “在头两年，这是充满挑战的。她的收入足以偿还债务并支付支出和其他基本需求。最初，她在一家冷冻食品厂工作，去了对虾去皮，但温度如此之低，以至于连工作服都一直抱怨自己一直很冷。” Tran说。 </p><p> Initially, Ngo made between $400-$600 a month —a sum that her mother describes as “not much”—changing from one random job to another after she decided she could no longer stand the sub-zero temperatures at the frozen food plant. By her third year, Tran says her daughter spoke Korean well enough that she was able to secure a stable job as a quality controller for a manufacturing company, which saw her monthly income more than double to between $1,000 and $1,200. Average monthly earnings in South Korea are $2,900, about 10 times the Vietnamese average of $281, according to the Census and Economic Information Center (CEIC).</p><p>最初，Ngo的月收入在400-600美元之间（她的母亲称这笔钱“不多”），在她决定不再忍受冷冻食品厂的零下温度后，从一份随意的工作变成了另一份工作。特兰说，到她的第三年，她的女儿说韩语的能力已经足够好，以至于她能够稳定地担任一家制造公司的质量控制员，她的月收入翻了一番多，达到了1,000美元至1200美元。根据人口普查和经济信息中心（CEIC）的数据，韩国的平均月收入为2,900美元，约为越南平均值281美元的10倍。</p><p> Tran says that, as well as work, Ngo found love abroad with another Vietnamese migrant; in his case, he entered South Korea on a legitimate work visa. For a while, they were making a substantial amount of money, especially once they married and the couple was able to pool their resources by moving in together, thus reducing their costs. Ngo sent money home regularly. Having paid off her debts and after she helped her parents turn their house into a home, through money which enabled them to furnish the property, they decided to try for a baby.</p><p> 特兰说，恩戈（Ngo）和工作一样，是在国外与另一位越南移民相爱的。就他而言，他是持合法工作签证进入韩国的。有一阵子，他们赚了很多钱，尤其是当他们结婚后，这对夫妇就可以通过搬家来集中资源，从而降低了成本。 Ngo定期寄钱回家。偿还了债务后，在她帮助父母通过使他们能够提供财产的金钱将其房子变成房屋之后，他们决定尝试生孩子。</p><p>  A few months later, elsewhere in Seoul, Nguyen’s daughter—the mother of little Mai—found herself having a similar conversation with her husband, weighing their options and also concluding it was time for a baby.</p><p>  几个月后，在汉城的其他地方，阮的女儿（小麦的母亲）发现自己与丈夫也进行了类似的交谈，权衡了他们的选择，并认为现在该是个婴儿的时候了。</p><p> If undocumented workers in some countries keep a low profile for fear of being caught by the authorities and sent back home, the families I spoke with paint a very different picture for Vietnamese citizens in South Korea.</p><p> 如果某些国家的无证件工人因担心被当局抓捕而被遣送回国而保持低调，我与之交谈的家庭对于在韩国的越南公民来说将是截然不同的景象。</p><p> “Not having legal status only limits your right to access state-funded services. That’s it,” Nguyen tells me, as we sit cross-legged over a spread of local fare, baby Mai nestled between her legs.</p><p> “没有合法身份只会限制您访问由国家资助的服务的权利。就是这样，”阮告诉我，当我们盘腿坐在一堆当地票价上的时候，迈伊婴儿正躺在两腿之间。</p><p> “You don’t live 10 to a room, fearing a knock on the door,” she says, carefully inserting a small spoon of broth inside her granddaughter’s mouth.</p><p> 她说：“您担心住在门上的敲门声，不会在房间里住10个，”她小心翼翼地将一小汤匙肉汤插入孙女的嘴里。</p><p> Health care is expensive, however. With no work permit, Nguyen’s daughter Le Binh An doesn’t benefit from health insurance. The birth costs alone were $5,000.</p><p> 但是，卫生保健很昂贵。没有工作许可，阮氏的女儿Le Binh An无法享受医疗保险。仅生育费用就是5,000美元。 </p><p>  “An hadn’t worked for about six months when COVID struck,” says Nguyen. In anticipation of the baby’s arrival, they moved into “a bigger and nicer house,” which required a deposit of $600, a sum they borrowed from Le’s older sister, who is legally residing in South Korea with her Korean husband.</p><p>Nguyen说：“当COVID袭击时，大约六个月都没有工作。”为了预见婴儿的到来，他们搬进了“更大，更漂亮的房子”，需要支付600美元的押金，这笔钱是他们从Le的姐姐那里借来的，Le姐姐与她的韩国丈夫合法地居住在韩国。</p><p> “Their monthly rent is $500,” Nguyen tells me. “It was bad timing. Between one thing and another, they had little money coming in but many expenses. They haven’t had money to send through all year because they spent it all on the baby.”</p><p> Nguyen告诉我：“他们的月租金是500美元。” “时机不好。在一件事情和另一件事情之间，他们的钱很少，但支出却很多。他们一整年都没有钱寄出去，因为他们把所有的钱都花在了婴儿身上。”</p><p> Like Tran’s daughter Ngo, Le made it into the country by paying specialist brokers about $4,300 for a tourist visa. She has since been joined by her other siblings, as well as her husband, each person going through the same channels to secure entry.</p><p> 像特兰的女儿恩戈（Ngo）一样，勒伊通过向专业经纪人支付约4,300美元的旅游签证而进入了该国。此后，她的其他兄弟姐妹和丈夫也加入了她的行列，每个人都通过相同的渠道来确保入境。</p><p> Up until taking a break during the pregnancy, Nguyen’s daughter usually had regular work coming in. “An did whatever came her way: housekeeping, factory work, domestic help, anything,” Nguyen says.</p><p> 直到怀孕期间休息，阮的女儿通常都会有固定的工作进来。阮女士说：“她做了什么事：家政，工厂工作，家政服务等等。”</p><p> “And then COVID,” she adds, shrugging her shoulders. “My son-in-law’s work was always irregular. But now there are entire months he doesn’t work at all.”</p><p> “然后是COVID。”她耸耸肩膀。 “我女son​​的工作总是不规律的。但是现在整整几个月他都没有工作。”</p><p>  Ten years have passed since Le moved to South Korea, and Nguyen hasn’t seen her since.</p><p>  自从Le移居韩国以来已经过去了十年，而阮自此以后再也没有见过她。</p><p> “I see my firstborn often, or I did before the pandemic. But not An,” she says, reaching for a tissue and blowing into it, “I miss her very much.”</p><p> “我经常见长子，或者在大流行之前就见过。但不是安，”她伸手去拿一张纸巾，然后吹进去，“我非常想念她。 </p><p> She hardens when asked if she tried to persuade her to return: “No, she can’t come back. She must stay. If she comes to Vietnam, she will not be able to get back into South Korea. It’s important that she stay to give her daughter a good life.”</p><p>当被问及是否试图说服她返回时，她变得更加坚强：“不，她不能回来。她必须留下。如果她来到越南，她将无法回到韩国。为了让女儿过上好日子，重要的是要留下来。”</p><p> Kneeling alongside us, Nguyen’s two young grandsons, who have finished their meal, are comparing Pokemon cards. I recognize two of them as toddlers in another family portrait hanging on the wall. The two brothers haven’t physically seen their parents since the adults left for South Korea four years ago, when the boys were aged three and five.</p><p> 跪在地上的阮阮的两个小孙子正在对口袋妖怪卡片进行比较。我认识其中两个是墙上挂着的另一张全家福的小孩。自从成年人四年前离开韩国后，这两个兄弟还没有亲眼见过父母，当时男孩们分别为三岁和五岁。</p><p> In many Asian countries, where multi-generational households are common, children are often raised by extended family members. In this respect, Nguyen’s family set-up is unremarkable.</p><p> 在多代家庭很普遍的许多亚洲国家，孩子通常由大家庭成员抚养。在这方面，阮氏的家庭地位并不突出。</p><p> Almost a month has passed since Nguyen left Bau Bang with her granddaughter, enough time for the 6-month-old to develop an emotional attachment to her. Every time Nguyen puts Mai down, however briefly, she starts crying and looking around for her, her arms reaching into the air.</p><p> 自阮氏与孙女离开包邦以来，已经过去了将近一个月的时间，足以让这个6个月大的孩子对她产生情感上的依恋。每次Nguyen放下Mai时，无论多么短暂，她都会哭泣并四处寻找，双臂伸向空中。</p><p>  Although the babies were technically “unaccompanied,” insofar as they did not return with a legal guardian, in reality, they each traveled with an adult who agreed to take responsibility for them for the duration of the flight—for a fee.</p><p>  尽管从技术上讲，这些婴儿是“无人陪伴的”，但实际上他们并没有合法监护人的陪伴，实际上，他们每个人都是与一个成年人同行的，他们同意在飞行期间对他们负责，但要付费。</p><p> Trawl Facebook for Vietnamese community groups based in South Korea and many come up, some with tens of thousands of members. Three of the four families I spoke to said they had sent their babies back with people who had posted about the upcoming flight on one such group, although they said the Vietnamese Embassy in Seoul was also able to provide assistance in connecting parents with people booked to return. The fourth family I spoke to said they found somebody through an acquaintance. In all four cases, the parents agreed to cover the cost of the flight; just one had agreed to pay an extra sum once the child was safely delivered.</p><p> 面向位于韩国的越南社区团体的Facebook拖网活动，其中很多人都有成千上万的会员。我与之交谈的四个家庭中的三个说，他们已将与即将进行的航班相关的人员送回了一个这样的团体，尽管他们说，越南驻首尔大使馆也能够提供帮助，将父母与预定的人联系起来。返回。我与之交谈的第四个家庭说，他们是通过熟人找到人的。在所有四种情况下，父母都同意承担这次飞行的费用；只有一个人同意在孩子被安全分娩后支付额外的费用。</p><p> “An contacted them and asked for help, which she had to pay for,” says Nguyen. “Don’t be taken in by their age; all those old women asked for money to bring the babies back. Why would anyone help us for free?”</p><p> Nguyen说：“一个人联系了他们并寻求帮助，她必须为此付费。” “不要被他们的年龄所吸引；所有那些老妇都要求钱把婴儿带回来。为什么有人会免费帮助我们？” </p><p> Back in Seoul, once both parties were in agreement, a trip to the embassy was required to prepare the power of attorney and ensure all the necessary documentation.</p><p>双方同意后，回到汉城，必须前往使馆准备授权书并确保所有必要的文件。</p><p> “I had concerns, initially, but it was all above board, there were no risks, because the embassy was the witness. They had lawyers deal with the paperwork,” Nguyen adds.</p><p> “起初我很担心，但是一切都在上面，没有风险，因为使馆是证人。他们让律师处理文书工作。”阮说。</p><p>   Subsistence farmers Nguyen Hai Duong and her husband were unable to pay for their son to continue his education, so upon finishing high school, he found work as a driver in Vietnam  earning around $180 a month.</p><p>   自给自足的农民阮海阳（Nguyen Hai Duong）和她的丈夫无力支付儿子继续接受教育的费用，因此，高中毕业后，他在越南找到了一份工作，每月收入约180美元。</p><p> As more and more success stories from people of other communes heading to South Korea started circulating, and neighboring villages began sprouting larger homes, some with cars parked in the driveway, Pham Van Tuan believed that only by heading abroad, could he offer his family a similar quality of life.</p><p> 随着越来越多来自其他公社前往韩国的成功故事开始流传，邻近的村庄开始萌芽更大的房屋，其中一些车停在车道上，范范T（Pham Van Tuan）相信，只有前往国外，他才能为家人提供类似的生活质量。</p><p>  Pham has been in Seoul four years now and has since been joined by his wife and his only sister, who is enrolled as a student there.</p><p>  帕姆（Pham）到汉城已经四年了，此后，他的妻子和他的唯一姐姐（当时在该校就读）一起加入了汉城。</p><p> “He works in construction,” his mother tells me. “But it’s not stable. It’s just like construction here in Vietnam; it’s on and off, there’s no pattern. Tuan doesn’t speak Korean, so he can’t apply for a company, which means he can’t get a stable job. Sometimes, he’s unemployed for the whole month.”</p><p> “他在建筑上工作，”他的母亲告诉我。 “但这并不稳定。就像越南的建筑一样。它打开和关闭，没有任何模式。 Tuan不会说韩语，因此他无法申请公司，这意味着他无法找到稳定的工作。有时，他整个月都没有工作。”</p><p> Like all of the families I visit, they too enjoy a high level of material comfort. Tempting though it may be to interpret this as a sign her son’s gamble has paid off, Nguyen Hai’s comments hint at a more complex reality: “He’s paid off the cost of his trip. But we borrowed a lot of money for this house. And he had to borrow money—$12,000—for his sister to get there, not to mention the tuition fees.”</p><p> 像我拜访的所有家庭一样，他们也享有高度的物质舒适感。尽管很可能将这解释为她儿子的赌博已获得回报的迹象，但阮海的评论暗示了一个更为复杂的现实：“他已经付了旅费。但是我们为这所房子借了很多钱。他不得不借钱——12,000美元-让他的妹妹到那里去，更不用说学费了。” </p><p> Student visas in South Korea cost between $50 and $80. Undergraduate tuition fees for the year at top universities come in at around $6,500. But when I point out the difference between the actual costs and what her daughter paid to an agent to get a Korean visa, the fiftysomething-year-old insists they went in the only way they could.</p><p>韩国的学生签证费用在$ 50到$ 80之间。顶尖大学一年的本科生学费约为6,500美元。但是，当我指出实际费用与女儿为获得韩国签证而向代理商支付的费用之间的差额时，五十多岁的她坚持说，他们以唯一的方式去了。</p><p> A video call comes through from her son as we’re speaking. Nguyen Hai turns the cellphone to a large red hammock in the corner of the room, where Pham’s 7-month-old daughter is fast asleep.</p><p> 在我们讲话时，她儿子打了视频电话。阮海（Nguyen Hai）将手机转到房间角落的一个红色大吊床上，法姆（Pham）7个月大的女儿正在这里睡着。</p><p> “It’s difficult for him,” she says, as she hits the red button, ending the call. “For a month, he cried every day since sending their daughter back. I had to tell him to hang in there… he’s finally learned to accept the situation.”</p><p> 她说：“对他来说很难。”她按下红色按钮结束通话。 “有一个月的时间，自从送回女儿以来，他每天都在哭。我不得不告诉他呆在那里……他终于学会了接受这种情况。”</p><p> My plans to meet with a fourth family, based in one of the Central Vietnam provinces repeatedly battered by storms and typhoons throughout October and November—which provoked regular flooding and multiple landslides—were derailed on multiple occasions. Over the course of numerous phone calls, however, they too confirmed that their adult child had entered South Korea via a tourist visa paid for through agents.</p><p> 我计划与位于越南中部一省的第四家庭见面，该家庭在整个十月和十一月屡遭暴风雨和台风袭击，引发了经常性的洪水和多次山体滑坡，但多次出轨。然而，在无数次电话通话中，他们也证实了成年子女是通过旅行社签发的旅游签证进入韩国的。</p><p> In each case, families describe borrowing from multiple sources in order to afford the agents’ fees. No smuggling was involved. The visas appear to be legitimate. Tourist visas for Vietnamese nationals visiting South Korea start at $55 for a single trip. As one would expect, visa applications are subject to strict criteria, such as proof of income and savings, which these families say they would not normally fulfill.</p><p> 在每种情况下，家庭都描述了从多个来源借钱以支付代理商的费用。没有走私。签证似乎是合法的。越南公民来韩国的旅游签证单程起价为55美元。正如人们所期望的那样，签证申请必须遵守严格的标准，例如收入和储蓄证明，这些家庭说他们通常不会履行这些要求。</p><p> Given the sums involved and time frames required to pay off their debts (typically between one and three years), however, the math doesn’t always add up.</p><p> 考虑到涉及的总金额和还清债务所需的时间范围（通常在一年到三年之间），数学并不总是会加起来。</p><p> Asked if they had considered applying for a visa via the proper channels, without going through an agent, the families were all dismissive.</p><p> 当被问及他们是否考虑过通过适当的渠道而不是通过代理人申请签证时，他们全家都不屑一顾。 </p><p> Tran’s reply, in particular, though peppered with inaccuracies, encapsulated the way the families saw paying for entry to South Korea as a perfunctory transaction; as with many services, the right agent can help with complex bureaucracy, saving crucial time, if not always money.</p><p>特兰（Tran）的回信，特别是尽管充满了不准确之处，却概括了这些家庭将其作为进入韩国的交易视为一种敷衍的交易的方式。与许多服务一样，合适的代理人可以帮助解决复杂的官僚问题，从而节省关键时间，即使不是总是节省金钱。</p><p> “If we wanted to go through the legal process, we would have to learn the language; who knows whether we’d pass the test? Applying for a tourist visa to South Korea is really hard. You have to prove your income. How can we make 300 or 400 or 500 million dong a year for three years in a row to prove it?” said Tran.</p><p> “如果我们想通过法律程序，我们将必须学习语言；谁知道我们是否可以通过考试？申请前往韩国的旅游签证真的很困难。你必须证明你的收入。我们如何连续三年每年赚300或400或5亿越南盾来证明这一点？”特兰说。</p><p> When it was pointed out to her that, while proof of sufficient funds is required, the sums involved are nowhere near as high and that a language test isn’t necessary for a tourist visa, she paused before replying: “Anyway, this is the easiest way to go, who knows how long we would have to wait if we applied. This way works and it’s quick.”</p><p> 当向她指出时，虽然需要足够的资金证明，但涉及的金额远远不高，而且不需要旅游签证的语言测试，她停顿了一下，然后回答：“无论如何，这是最简单的方法，谁知道如果我们申请的话我们要等多久。这样行之有效，而且很快。”</p><p>  Independent anti-trafficking and modern slavery expert, Mimi Vu, has seen it all before, including the cognitive dissonance at play.</p><p>  独立的反人​​口贩运和现代奴隶制专家Mimi Vu以前就已经看到了这一切，包括游戏中的认知失调。</p><p> “They think they are making very rational decisions, but it’s often based on extremely fa</p><p> “他们认为自己做出的决策非常合理，但这通常是基于</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-international-flights-filled-with-unaccompanied-babies">https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-international-flights-filled-with-unaccompanied-babies</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/独奏/">#独奏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/flights/">#flights</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/婴儿/">#婴儿</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
