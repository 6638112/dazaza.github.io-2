"note_en": "While physical proximity and the use of face masks are well-known factors in the spread of COVID-19, new research links meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation\u00a0to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) finds.\n A research team led by Assistant Professor  Kai Chen investigated 2,669 counties throughout all regions and states in the United States from March 15 to December 31, 2020 to determine how readily the virus was transmitted.\n They found that warmer temperatures (above 20\u00b0 Celsius), increased humidity, and higher levels of UV radiation were moderately associated with a lower reproductive number (a measurement of how many new infections are caused by a single infected person in a fully susceptible population), meaning that these factors were likewise associated with decreased person-to-person transmission. Of the three factors, absolute humidity played the greatest role.\n The study,  published today in the journal Nature Communications, provides one of the most robust bodies of scientific evidence yet linking weather conditions to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Early epidemiological studies of COVID-19 and meteorological factors offered uncertain and contradictory findings, mainly due to short study periods, inadequate control for confounding, and inappropriate COVID-19-related outcome variables and statistical methods.\n \u201cA unique strength of our study was its comprehensive control for the space- and time-varying non-meteorological factors, including using the reproductive number adjusted for public health interventions and simultaneously controlling for spatially and temporally heterogenous confounders,\u201d said Chen, a member of  YSPH\u2019s Department of Environmental Health Sciences and the\u00a0 Yale Center on Climate Change and Health (CCCH). \u201cAccounting for the substantial differences in the epidemic curves and confounding factors among states and counties, we were able to quantify the nonlinear associations between meteorological factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States in 2020.\u201d\n In total, Chen and the members of his research team determined 17.5% of the virus\u2019 reproductive number was attributable to meteorological factors. Specifically, they found that temperature accounted for 3.73%, humidity accounted for 9.35%, and UV radiation for 4.44%.\n The fractions attributable to meteorological factors generally were higher in northern counties than in southern counties, meaning the people living in regions such as New England may need to be especially vigilant about the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in winter, when cold and dry weather and low levels of UV radiation offer favorable conditions for COVID-19 spread, the researchers said.\n Yale Professor Robert Dubrow, director of CCCH and a co-author of this study, said the findings suggest that the role of meteorological factors in COVID-19 dynamics is meaningful but not dominant. \u201cPublic health measures, including vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, represent the primary strategies for mitigating transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d he said.\n Yiqun Ma, a doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, is the first author of this study.

For in-depth profiles and founder interviews released every 2 weeks \u2013 subscribe below:\n       If you\u2019ve followed insurtech for more than a week, you\u2019ve probably read about embedded insurance. That is, incorporating insurance point-of-sales directly into the purchase flow of the asset you\u2019re trying to insure. It\u2019s an incredibly effective distribution channel.\n While other companies like  Boost Insurance are trying to make it easy for retailers (e.g. an online used car marketplace) to offer insurance, Wrapbook is taking a verticalized approach: not only is Wrapbook providing a unique payroll product for project-based industries, they\u2019re also a licensed insurance agency.\n Wrapbook, at its core, is trying to answer:  how do you make it as easy as possible for project-based industries (e.g. entertainment) to manage their operations? These are industries that cycle through a freelance workforce and where each project requires a unique set of insurance policies that range from workers comp to production insurance to temporary fleet insurance.\n Wrapbook takes a network-based approach, accumulating a network of project-based workers who cycle through a set of similar employers. If it all works, Wrapbook\u2019s feedback loops can snowball into becoming the first digital-first payroll software for the entertainment industry and sophisticated production insurance underwriters \u2013\u00a0taking cuts out of the $181b entertainment payroll space and the $17b entertainment insurance space in the process.\n     The entertainment industry relies heavily on a freelance workforce. With each new project, production companies need to onboard and pay new employees and get together a slew of insurance policies.\n Entertainment companies (e.g. movies, television, broadway, music tours) are businesses that face the same hiring needs and liabilities as all others. However, what\u2019s unique here is that the entertainment industry inherently relies on a freelance workforce that cycles through multiple employers a year. For every project \u2013 whether that\u2019s a movie, a television show, a commercial, or a broadway play \u2013\u00a0the production company needs to hire, onboard, insure, and pay their employees.\n Today, classically, the payroll process for entertainment and project-based work is riddled with a lot of tedium. You\u2019d onboard everyone with paper. You\u2019d scan it and send it to a company who would process it. That company, in return, sends you a very long workers comp questionnaire. (Ali Javid, CEO, Wrapbook)\n Given the project-based nature of the workforce in the entertainment industry, traditional payroll processors do not operate here. Payroll processing within the entertainment industry, consequently, has historically been a very manual and laborious process. (Richard Kerby, Partner, Equal Ventures)\n Moreover, just as a production company needs to hire their employees with each project, they also need a whole new set of insurance policies. Production companies, after all, rent out locations and work with very expensive equipment such as top-of-the-shelf cameras or rental cars. These production companies need a variety of policies such as general liability, rental equipment coverage, 3rd party property insurance, and auto liability for non-owned vehicles.\n   Wrapbook provides a 10x better product experience by allowing production companies to hire and pay their project-based workers and insure them digitally. Employers can populate all of their workers\u2019 information, share job details with them, input wage rates, and outsource all other information collected on their workforce into the Wrapbook platform. Wrapbook is the first platform to embrace the worker, enabling them to create and own their digital profile. (Richard Kerby, Partner, Equal Ventures)\n  As part of the payroll offering, Wrapbook enables employers to efficiently onboard employees, with auto-generated contracts and employment forms, and eSignatures. Importantly, when employees onboard onto Wrapbook, they only need to onboard  once (which is the foundation of Wrapbook\u2019s network-based approach).\n Wrapbook\u2019s payroll system is compliant with labor, union, and guild rules and will auto-generate all the appropriate tax filings. Moreover, Wrapbook has built-in time-tracking with all the payment reporting easily traceable. Built for the entertainment industry, Wrapbook helps employers organize their payroll on a project basis.\n  When it comes to the network aspect, the employee Wrapbook profile enables  other employers to swiftly and effortlessly onboard those employees. So, if two employers are both using Wrapbook, employees do not need to make a new account or be onboarded differently each time. This network-based helps with organic growth:\n Workers receiving payment through Wrapbook is a much nicer way as an employee to manage their payments. They\u2019re able to bring their profile to the next employer. Employees  want to be paid through Wrapbook and they tell their next employer exactly this. At the time when we raised our Series A, 12% of users had used their Wrapbook profile across more than one employer. (Cameron Woodward, CMO, Wrapbook)\n On the insurance side, Wrapbook acts as an insurance agency selling general liability to cover 3rd party injury and damage and errors &amp; omissions, rental equipment coverage, 3rd party property insurance (when renting out locations), and hired &amp; non-owned auto policies (for the vehicles used in production). Workers compensation is bundled directly into the payroll.\n Wrapbook offers  annual DICE policies for companies that shoot multiple productions in a year. This doesn\u2019t apply to major feature film shoots (where a separate company is typically set up specifically for that film). With a DICE policy, the employer doesn\u2019t have to negotiate on a per-project basis. Wrapbook annual policies start at  $2,250 (typical policies range from $3,000 to $25,000).\n Our system understands the risks associated with each project. We understand the location, all the workers from the producers to the safety set coordinators to the gaffers, electricians, etc. All of a sudden, we\u2019re able to start monitoring risk, not only at the project level, but at the worker level. This person seems to sprain their ankle a lot. We understand the risks associated with each project and we can reject bad risk.\u00a0(Ali Javid, CEO, Wrapbook)\n Wrapbook\u2019s network-based approach goes as follows: the more employers on the platform, the more (portable) worker profiles, which in turn leads to more data to underwrite with and more employers to onboard (as workers move from project to project). Down the line, with an abundance of data, Wrapbook can offer better financial services, attracting more employers onto the platform.\n  Looking at its payroll business alone, Wrapbook doesn\u2019t need to carve out the largest chunk of the market to become a $1b business. Add in the additional revenue Wrapbook can generate from its insurance policies and it has a more promising path to become a $1b business.\n  Payroll TAM: Wrapbook\u2019s charges 1.5% of union wages paid through its platform and receives a commission on DICE policies sold. The U.S. film and television industry supports  2.5 million workers and pays out over  $181b in wages annually. Simple math tells us Wrapbook has a  payroll TAM of $2.7b.\n Entertainment Insurance TAM: The entertainment insurance industry is a  $17b market in the U.S. At a 15% commission, Wrapbook has an insurance TAM of $2.6b.\n  Looking at Wrapbook solely as a payroll software company: Incumbent payroll providers vary widely from 5.5x (ADP) to ~19.5x (Paycom). Assuming Wrapbook trades at a more favorable multiple of 10x, to be valued at $1b, Wrapbook would need to generate $100m in revenue, or 3.7% of Wrapbook\u2019s  payroll TAM \u2013\u00a0bumping that to a 20x revenue multiple, Wrapbook would only need to capture ~1.9% of the market.\n Wrapbook could well have a path to a $1b valuation with its payroll business model alone. If its network-based strategy works, it would have a customer acquisition flywheel. Wrapbook\u2019s revenue from its insurance commissions is the icing on the cake here. In a vacuum, Wrapbook won\u2019t be valued as  just a payroll company (insurance agencies trade at  ~3x revenue to ~4x like AJG, which would likely bring Wrapbook\u2019s  overall multiple down). With the multiple revenue streams, we could see Wrapbook having multiple paths to a $1b valuation without having to rely on its payroll business alone.\n Moreover, Wrapbook\u2019s problems, in the abstract, don\u2019t apply to just the entertainment industry. There are  59 million freelance workers in the U.S. (or ~36% of the U.S. workforce). These problems can extend to industries such as construction that have their own set of unique liabilities. If they find that the network-based playbook works for the entertainment industry, they now have a playbook that could work for other industries such as construction, staffing, as well as, maids and nannies \u2013\u00a0all of which would greatly expand Wrapbook\u2019s TAM.\n Wrapbook\u2019s potential seems quite clear. It\u2019s operating in an antiquated industry burdened by paperwork. Though, it could be something much more. By being the focal point of interaction, Wrapbook is gathering  continual risk profiles on its workers and employers. Wrapbook\u2019s payroll software enables it to have multiple touchpoints with the insured throughout their employment lifecycle and across employers. Through scale and enough data, Wrapbook could move out of the agency model and create a differentiated insurance offering altogether.\n Wrapbook may not only become  the place for entertainment payroll. With their embedded insurance play, they may well become  the place for entertainment insurance. Employers will come for the payroll, but they\u2019ll stay for the insurance.\n  Thank you to  Ali Javid and  Cameron Woodward of Wrapbook, as well as,  Richard Kerby of Equal Ventures.\n           Have any other questions, comments, or feedback?

And its extremely volatile trading activities make it still too early to say how it\u2019s going to play out. But according to one of the earliest purveyors of cryptocurrencies, the vast majority of NFTs in the market today will be worthless in just a few years. In an  interview on Bloomberg TV this week, Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam drew parallels between the rise of cryptocurrencies and the dotcom boom of the 1990s. \u201cI go so far as to say that 90% of NFTs produced, they probably will have little to no value in three to five years,\u201d Ehrsam said. \u201cYou could say the same thing about early internet companies in the late \u201990s.\u201d   To him, NFTs are no different than any other crypto project born out of the hype overnight. SEE ALSO:  Elon Musk\u2019s Bitcoin Tweets Make Him \u2018Most Hated Person in Crypto,\u2019 Study Finds \u201cPeople are going to try all sorts of things. There\u2019ll be millions and millions of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, just like there were millions and millions of websites. Most of them won\u2019t work,\u201d Ehrsam explained.  Ehrsam  began trading Bitcoin around 2010 while working as a foreign exchange trader at Goldman Sachs. He left the investment bank to cofound the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase with  Brian Armstrong in 2012. Ehrsam parted ways with Armstrong in 2017 and launched Paradigm, a blockchain investment firm, in 2018. Coinbase  went public earlier this year at a colossal valuation of $100 billion. Its market cap has since shrunk by half as crypto trading cools down amid global regulatory pressure and  celebrity-induced sell-off, among other factors. Short-term fluctuation aside, Ehrsam believes that cryptocurrency is truly \u201cthe next internet-sized opportunity for the United States.\u201d   \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t change overnight, but you can see the seeds of exponential growth occurring already,\u201d he said in the Bloomberg interview. \u201cI do think we will live in a future where for us to coordinate, we won\u2019t need these centralized platforms today. That\u2019s already true of financial services, in that you can be your own bank. You don\u2019t need a central institution to hold your money anymore.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 06:09:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "cofounder,worthless,ehrsam", "title": "Coinbase Cofounder\u8b66\u544a\uff0c90\uff05\u7684NFT\u5c06\u57283\u52305\u5e74\u5185\u6beb\u65e0\u4ef7\u503c ", "title_en": "90% of NFTs Will Be Worthless in 3 to 5 Years, Coinbase Cofounder Warns", "transed": 1, "url": "https://observer.com/2021/06/coinbase-cofounder-warn-nfts-worthless-interview/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["cofounder", "worthless", "ehrsam"]}]
