In reviewing a volume of Borges&#39; &#34;fictions within fictions&#34; in the September 29, 1967 Commonweal , Ronald Christ called the term &#34;Borgesian,&#34; like Kafkaesque, &#34;indispensable for the specification and clarification of our awareness.&#34; In 1961, Borges shared the International Publishers Prize with Samuel Beckett. Several collections of his stories and poems have been translated into English: Labyrinths , Ficciones , Other Inquisitions , Dream Tigers, A Personal Anthology.  Mr. Borges was inter­ viewed by Patricia Marx, weekly interviewer for WNYC, and John Simon, drama critic for New York Magazine .</p><p>通常被认为是西班牙散文的最大生活作者，Jorge Luis Borges出生于1899年在布宜诺斯艾利斯。在审查一卷博格＆＃39; ＆＃34;小说中的小说＆＃34; 1967年9月29日，罗纳德基督称之为第34条;博尔格斯人，＆＃34;喜欢Kafkaesque，＆＃34;对于我们的认识的规范和澄清是不可或缺的。＆＃34; 1961年，Borges与塞缪尔贝克特共享国际出版商奖金。他的几个故事和诗歌已经翻译成英文：迷宫，诡计，其他宗教裁判，梦想老虎，个人选集。 Borges先生是由Patricia Marx，WNYC的每周采访者和John Simon，纽约杂志的戏剧评论家互访。</p><p> Commonweal: Mr. Borges, you recently spent quite some time visiting Harvard University as the Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry. I wonder what your impressions were of students there.</p><p> Commonweal：Borges先生，您最近花了很长时间访问哈佛大学，因为诗歌的Charles Eliot Norton教授。我想知道你在那里的学生的印象。</p><p> Jorge Luis Borges: I found the students very keen. One of them wrote a parody of my stuff, and I was introduced as one of the characters. He also gave me some fine lines of verse. For example this one—I wish I had written it and anybody would say the same—it&#39;s a pity it wasn&#39;t written in the 17th or maybe in the 18 th century: &#34;So chaste was she that lilies were her roses.&#34;</p><p> Jorge Luis Borges：我发现学生非常敏锐。其中一个是我的东西的模仿，我被介绍为一个角色。他也给了我一些细微的诗句。例如这一个 - 我希望我写了它，任何人都会说同样的它＆＃39; Sa Pity It不是第17世纪或者在18世纪书面上写的：＆＃34;所以贞洁是她百合花是她的玫瑰。＆＃34;</p><p> CW: You began writing as a poet and essayist, and it was not until after a serious illness that you started writing stories. Do you value one form of writing more than another?</p><p> CW：你开始写作作为诗人和散文者，直到你开始写作故事的严重疾病。您是否重视了一种写作的形式，而不是另一个形式？</p><p> JLB: Well, I suppose that they&#39;re all essentially the same. In fact, I hardly know what I&#39;m going to write—an article, a story, a poem in free verse—or in some regular form. I only know that when I have the first sentence. And when the first sentence makes a kind of pattern, then I find out the kind of rhythm I&#39;m looking for. And then I go on. But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any essential difference, at least for me, between writing poetry and writing prose.</p><p> JLB：嗯，我想他们和＃39;重新完全相同。事实上，我几乎不知道我会写一篇文章，一个故事，一个自由诗句的诗，或以某种规律的形式写作。我只知道当我有第一句话时。当第一句话造成一种模式时，那么我发现了那种节奏的＆＃39;正在寻找。然后我继续。但我不想在写诗和写作散文之间至少对我而言，他们认为那里。</p><p>  JLB: Yes. When I feel I&#39;m going to write something, then I just am quiet and I try to listen. Then something comes through. And I do what I can in order not to tamper with it. And then, when I begin to hear what&#39;s coming through, I write it down. I try to avoid purple patches, fine writing, all that kind of thing… because I think they&#39;re a mistake. And then sometimes it comes through and sometimes it doesn&#39;t, but that&#39;s not up to me. It&#39;s up to chance.</p><p>  JLB：是的。当我觉得我＆＃39;我要写一些东西，那么我只是安静，我试着倾听。然后有些东西通过了。我尽我所能，以便不要篡改它。然后，当我开始听到什么＆＃39来，我把它写下了。我试图避免紫色修补，精美的写作，所有这些东西......因为我认为他们＆＃39;重新出错。然后有时它会通过，有时它不会＆＃39; t，但它不是由我决定的。它＆＃39;达到机会。</p><p>    JLB: No, it comes and goes. Sometimes there are periods of aridity, periods where nothing happens. But then I know those periods are real. I know that when I think of myself as being utterly worn out, when I think that somehow I have nothing more to write, then something is happening within me. And, in due course, it bubbles up; it comes to the surface, and then I do my best to listen. But there&#39;s nothing mystical about all this. I suppose all writers do the same.</p><p>    JLB：不，它来了。有时有干燥的时期，什么都没有发生。但后来我知道这些时期是真实的。我知道当我认为自己完全疲惫不堪，当我认为某种时候我没有什么比写作，那么在我内部发生了一些事情。并且，在适当的时候，它泡起来;它来到了表面，然后我尽我所能倾听。但是，没有任何这一切的东西。我想所有的作家都这样做。 </p><p> CW: In his review of your  Personal Anthology John Simon made the point that in contrast to so many other writers who make distinctions between reality and illusion, in your writing, reality is illusion, and illusion is reality, being one and the same.</p><p>CW：在他对您的个人选集的审查中，约翰西蒙表示，与如此众多在现实和幻觉之间的其他作家相比之下，在您的写作中，现实是幻觉，并且幻觉是现实，是一个和同样的。</p><p> JLB: Well I wonder whether we can make a distinction. Because in order to make that distinction we would have to know whether we are real or unreal. And, I suppose, as philosophers have been bickering and quarreling over that for the last 2,000 or 3,000 years; it&#39;s not up to me to decide.</p><p> JLB：我想知道我们是否可以区分。因为为了使这个区别，我们必须知道我们是否是真实的或虚幻的。而且，我想，由于哲学家在过去的2000或3,000年来上争吵并争吵;它不是由我决定的。</p><p> Let&#39;s say that the words &#34;an unreal thing&#34; or &#34;an unreal happening&#34;—are a contradiction in terms. Because if you can speak about something, or even dream something, then that something is real. Unless of course you have a different meaning for the word &#34;real.&#34; But I don&#39;t see how things can be unreal. I don&#39;t see any valid reason why Hamlet, for example, should be less real than Lloyd George.</p><p> 假设单词＆＃34;一个虚幻的事情＆＃34;或者＆＃34;一个不真实的发生和＃34;  - 依据矛盾。因为如果你可以谈论某事，甚至梦想，那么事情就是真实的。除非当然，否则对单词＆＃34有不同的含义。＆＃34;但我没有看到事情是如何虚幻的。我没有看到哈姆雷特的任何有效原因，比Lloyd George不那么真实。</p><p> CW: You&#39;ve been attracted to fantastic writings. Does this same concept apply to the fantastic?</p><p> CW：你＆＃39; Ve被梦幻般的着作被吸引。这件概念是否适用于奇妙？</p><p> JLB: I am attracted to fantastic writing, and fantastic reading, of course. But I think things that we call fantastic may be real, in the sense of being real symbols. If I write a fantastic story, I&#39;m not writing something willful. On the contrary, I am writing something that stands for my feelings, or for my thoughts. So that, in a sense, a fantastic story is as real and perhaps more real than a mere circumstantial story. Because after all, circumstances come and go, and symbols remain.</p><p> JLB：当然，我被梦幻般的写作和梦幻般的阅读。但我认为我们称之为奇妙可能是真实的，这是真正的符号的意义。如果我写一个梦幻般的故事，我没有写故意的东西。相反，我正在写一个代表我的感受，或者我的想法。因此，从某种意义上说，一个梦幻般的故事是真实的，也许比仅仅是一个不仅仅是一个环境的故事。因为毕竟，情况来往往，留下符号。</p><p> Symbols are there all the time. If I write about a certain street corner in Buenos Aires, that street corner may pass away for all I know. But if I write about mazes, or about mirrors, or about the night, or about evil, and fear, those things are everlasting—I mean they will be always with us. So, in a sense, I suppose a writer of the fantastic is writing of things far more real than, well, what newspapermen write about. Because they&#39;re always writing about mere accidents, circumstances. But, of course, we all live in time. I think that when we write about the fantastic, we&#39;re trying to get away from time and to write about everlasting things. I mean we do our best to be in eternity, though we may not quite succeed in our attempt.</p><p> 符号一直存在。如果我在布宜诺斯艾利斯写一条街角，那街角可能会给我所知道的一切都消失。但是，如果我写下迷宫，或关于镜子，或关于夜晚，或关于邪恶，以及恐惧，那些事情是永恒的 - 我的意思是他们将永远和我们在一起。所以，从某种意义上说，我想是一个梦幻般的作家，写作的东西比，好，好的报道写了什么。因为它们＆＃39;始终写作意外，情况。但是，当然，我们都及时居住。我认为当我们写下梦幻般的时，我们试图逃离时间并写下永恒的事情。我的意思是我们尽最大努力成为永恒，尽管我们可能无法在我们的尝试中成功。</p><p>  JLB: I have greatly enjoyed Pirandello. I mean that game, for example, between the actors and the spectators. But I do not think he invented that game. Because in a sense you&#39;re getting that game all the time in Cervantes. I wonder if you remember that the characters in Cervantes have read  Don Quixote. And that some characters speak about Cervantes, and even poke fun at him. That is the same kind of game.</p><p>  JLB：我非常喜欢Pirandello。我的意思是，例如，参与者和观众之间的游戏。但我不认为他发明了这场比赛。因为在某种意义上，你一直在塞万提斯获得这场比赛。我想知道你是否记得塞万提斯中的角色已经读过唐吉诃德。有些人物谈论塞万提斯，甚至对他嘲笑。这是同一种游戏。 </p><p> CW: What about people like E.T.A. Hoffmann and the German romantics? Have you felt any sympathy with them?</p><p>CW：像e.t.a这样的人呢？霍夫曼和德国浪漫主义者？你有没有感到同情他们？</p><p> JLB: Well I have done my best to admire Hoffmann, but he&#39;s always defeated me. Because I think of him as being quite irresponsible. At the same time I don&#39;t think of him as being particularly amusing. Of course you might say that Lewis Carroll is irresponsible, but I feel attracted to him, and I don&#39;t feel attracted to Hoffmann. But that, of course, is my personal mistake, or my personal heresy, I should say.</p><p> JLB：我已经尽我所能欣赏Hoffmann，但他总是击败了我。因为我认为他是不负责任的。与此同时，我不想他特别有趣。当然，你可能会说刘易斯卡罗尔是不负责任的，但我觉得被他吸引了，我不受霍夫曼被吸引。但是，当然，我的个人错误是我应该说的。</p><p>  JLB: Well, if I may use old-fashioned and rather phony American slang, I shall accuse him of piling on the agonies. I remember that Poe was asked about his horror, and they thought that his horror came out of German romantics. He said, &#34;Horror belongs not to Germany but to the soul.&#34; I suppose personally his life was awful enough, he had no need of looking for that horror in books.</p><p>  JLB：嗯，如果我可以使用老式，而且私人的美国俚语，我会指责他对痛苦打桩。我记得那些Poe被问到他的恐怖，他们以为他的恐怖来自德国浪漫主义者。他说，＆＃34;恐怖属于德国，而是对灵魂。＆＃34;我个人认为他的生活足够令人敬畏，他不需要在书中寻找那种恐怖。</p><p> CW: You have said that the purpose of your writing is &#34;to explore the literary possibilities of certain philosophical systems.&#34;</p><p> CW：你已经说过你写作的目的是＆＃34;探讨某些哲学系统的文学可能性。＆＃34;</p><p> JLB: Many people have thought of me—of course, I can only be grateful to them-as a thinker, as a philosopher, or even as a mystic. Well the truth is that though I have found reality perplexing enough—in fact, I find it gets more perplexing all the time—I never think of myself as a thinker. But people think that I&#39;ve committed myself to idealism, to solipsism, or to doctrines of the cabala, because I&#39;ve used them in my tales. But really I was only trying to see what could be done with them. On the other hand, it might be argued that if I use them it&#39;s because I was feeling an affinity to them. Of course, that&#39;s true. But in fact I&#39;m in too much of a mental muddle to know where I am—an idealist or not. I&#39;m a mere man of letters, and I do what I can with those subjects.</p><p> JLB：很多人都想到了我 - 当然，我只能感激他们 - 作为思想家，作为哲学家，甚至是神秘主义者。真相是，虽然我发现了足够令人困惑的现实 - 事实上，我发现它一直变得更加困惑 - 我从不将自己视为思想家。但人们认为，我致力于理想主义，对唯一的理想主义，或者对卡巴拉的教义，因为我在我的故事中使用了他们。但真的，我只是试图看出可以与他们所做的事情。另一方面，可能会争辩说，如果我用它们，那么因为我对他们感到亲和力。当然，那个＆＃39;真的。但事实上，我在太多的精神上糊涂了我是我是一个理想主义者的傻瓜。我是一个信件的人，我做了我能做的那些科目。</p><p>  JLB: No, I don&#39;t have, but I hope to have one. Of course, I can believe in God, in the sense that Matthew Arnold gave to that word, something not ourselves that makes for righteousness. But I suppose that that&#39;s rather shadowy. I suppose you want more on that. Now as to a personal god, I don&#39;t like to think of God as a person—though I&#39;m quite fond of people, and I suppose I&#39;m a person myself, after all. But I don&#39;t think I have any use for a god who is very much interested, let us say, in ethics, in what I am doing. I would rather like to think of God as being a kind of adventurer—even as Wells thought about him—or perhaps as something within us making for some unknown purpose. I don&#39;t think I can really believe in doomsday; I could hardly believe in rewards and punishments, in heaven or hell. As I wrote down in one of my sonnets—I seem to be always plagiarizing, imitating myself or somebody else for that matter—I think I am quite unworthy of heaven or of hell, and even of immortality. I mean I might accept immortality, if I had to do it. But I would prefer—if there is any afterlife—to know nothing whatever about Borges, about his experiences in this world. But I suppose identity depends on memory. And if my memory is blotted out, then I wonder if I exist—I mean, if I am the same person. Of course, I don&#39;t have to solve that problem. It&#39;s up to God, if any. So that I ask of any God, of any gods, that if they give immortality, I hope to be granted oblivion also.</p><p>  JLB：不，我没有，但我希望有一个。当然，我可以相信上帝，感觉马修阿诺德给了那个词，不是我们自己是正义的东西。但我想那个＆＃39;也不是阴暗。我想你想要更多。现在就是一个个人的上帝，我不喜欢把上帝视为一个人 - 虽然我很喜欢人，我想我是一个人自己，毕竟是一个人。但我不认为我对一个非常感兴趣的上帝有任何用途，让我们在道德中，在我正在做的事情中。我宁愿想到上帝是一种冒险者 - 即使在我们对他的看法 - 或者在我们内心的某些未知目的时也是如此。我不认为我真的相信世界末日;我很难相信天国或地狱的奖励和惩罚。当我在我的一个十四行诗中写下时 - 我似乎总是抄袭，模仿自己或其他人 - 我觉得我非常不值得天堂或地狱，甚至不朽。如果我不得不这样做，我的意思是我可能会接受不朽。但我更愿意 - 如果有任何来生，那么无论博尔斯如何就读，关于他在这个世界的经历。但我想身份取决于内存。如果我的记忆被弄清楚，那么我想知道我是否存在 - 我的意思是，如果我是同一个人。当然，我不得不解决这个问题。它＆＃39;如果有的话。所以我问任何上帝，任何众神，如果他们给出不朽，我希望也希望被授予遗忘。</p><p>   CW: Let me ask about one more German that I&#39;m curious how you feel about, I mean Rainer Maria Rilke.</p><p>   CW：让我问一个再德语，我觉得你的感觉好奇，我的意思是rainer maria rilke。 </p><p> JLB: I don&#39;t know, I have a feeling that he&#39;s been greatly overrated. I think of him as a very pleasant poet. I know some of his pieces by heart, or at least I did. But I never could be very interested in him. But if I have to speak of German writers, there is one German writer that I would like to speak about. And I think I spent most of my life reading and rereading him—at first in English and now in German. And that writer is, as you may have guessed, Arthur Schopenhauer. I think that if I had to choose one philosopher, one metaphysician, I would choose Schopenhauer. Or if not, I suppose I would fall back—and be very happy about it—on Berkeley or on Hume. So you see that I&#39;m quite old-fashioned. But I think of Schopenhauer as belonging to the 18th century. I think his irony and his pleasant style—and the word &#34;pleasant&#34; means much to me—belong rather to the 18th than to the 19th century. And certainly they don&#39;t belong to the cumbrous dialect of his German contemporaries. I think that, in a sense, he was more of a contemporary of Gibbon or of Voltaire than of Hegel or Fichte, whom he hated, as you all know.</p><p>JLB：我不知道，我有一种感觉他被大得多高估了。我认为他是一个非常愉快的诗人。我衷心了解他的一些作品，或者至少我做过。但我从来没有对他非常感兴趣。但如果我必须谈论德国作家，那么我想谈论一个德国作家。而且我想我大部分人生都在阅读并在英语中首先骑着他，现在是德语。那个作家是，正如你可能猜到的那样，Arthur Schopenhauer。我认为如果我不得不选择一个哲学家，一个形而上学家，我会选择斯彭纳尔。或者如果不是，我想我会回归 - 在伯克利或休谟上非常高兴。所以你看到我和＃39; m很老相。但我认为舍纳邦伯师属于18世纪。我认为他的讽刺和他愉快的风格 - 这个词＆＃34;愉快＆＃34;对我来说意味着太多 - 属于比19世纪的18世纪。当然，他们不属于他德国同时代人的累积方言。我认为，从某种意义上说，他更多的是长臂猿或伏尔泰的当代比他所知道的黑格尔或佛罗里达州，因为你们都知道。</p><p> CW: Mr. Borges, do you feel in any way indebted to surrealism? Either through Ultraism or some other form?</p><p> CW：Borges先生，你觉得以任何方式感激超现实主义吗？通过超自主义或其他形式？</p><p> JLB: Well, as a matter of fact, I know very little about surrealism. But I hope it&#39;s better than Ultraism, because I think of Ultraism as being sheer stuff and nonsense. And that&#39;s the feeling most of us old Ultraists have. It was merely a boyish joke, and I hope we&#39;ve grown out of it. And yet now and then when I write, I evolve very silly metaphors, and then I know that&#39;s my old self—that&#39;s the man I was let&#39;s say around 1920—who&#39;s still lurking somewhere and who&#39;s trying to spoil everything I write.</p><p> JLB：嗯，事实上，我对超现实主义非常了解。但我希望它能比超出＆＃39;因为我认为超出纯粹的东西和废话。那个＆＃39;我们大多数美国旧的紫外线都有。这只是一个博爱的笑话，我希望我们长大了。然而现在然后，当我写的时候，我演变了非常愚蠢的隐喻，然后我知道那个＆＃39;我的旧自我和＃39;我在1920年大约左右说谎＆＃39;仍然潜伏在某个地方，谁＆＃39;试图破坏我写的一切。</p><p> CW; Well, what do you do with those metaphors—do you keep them or do you throw them out?</p><p> CW;那么，你对那些隐喻做了什么 - 你保留他们还是扔掉它们？</p><p> JLB: Yes, I keep them, and I attribute them to imaginary writers, so that I use them for the sake of parody. Because after all I&#39;ve got to put them to some use. And maybe in a sneaking way I&#39;m fond of them.</p><p> JLB：是的，我保留它们，我将它们归结为虚构的作家，以便我为模仿使用它们。因为毕竟我＆＃39;你必须把它们放在一些使用。也许以偷偷摸摸的方式我喜欢他们。</p><p> CW: Are there any contemporary writers that you are attracted to and feel an affinity for?</p><p> CW：是否有任何当代作家，你被吸引并感受到亲和力？</p><p> JLB: Well, if I have to speak of contemporary writers, I should be thinking about Plato, about Sir Thomas Browne, about Spinoza, about Thomas De Quincy, about Emerson, about Schopenhauer, of course. Maybe, why not? About Angelus Silesius, about Flaubert. That&#39;s as far as I care to go. But here I&#39;m merely repeating what Ezra Pound said. He said, &#34;All art is contemporary&#34;—and I think he was right. I don&#39;t see why a man, by the mere fact of sharing my experiences of living in the same century, should be more important to me than somebody who died many years ago. [After all, if I am reading somebody, that writer is a contemporary—I mean he belongs to the present.] So that I think the word &#34;modern&#34; means nothing whatever; and the word &#34;contemporary,&#34; of course, is a mere synonym of &#34;modern.&#34; I think they&#39;re both meaningless.</p><p> JLB：嗯，如果我必须谈论当代作家，我应该考虑柏拉图，关于塞诺萨爵士，关于斯科诺·昆西关于埃默森，当然，关于塞默森，关于斯豪纳伯州。也许，为什么不呢？关于Angelus Silesius，关于Fraubert。据我所能去，＆＃39;但是在这里，我只是重复ezra磅所说的。他说，＆＃34;所有艺术都是当代＆＃34;  - 我认为他是对的。我没有看到为什么一个男人在同一世纪分享生活的事实，对我来说比多年前去世的人更重要。 [毕竟，如果我正在读某人，那个作家是一种当代 - 我的意思是他属于现在。所以我认为这个词＆＃34;现代＆＃34;无论如何都意味着什么;和第＃34;当代，＆＃34;当然，是＆＃34;现代的同义词。＆＃34;我认为他们＆＃39;重新毫无意义。 </p><p> CW: You&#39;re renowned for your knowledge of literature and philosophy. Are there other arts that are as meaningful to you—painting or music?</p><p>CW：你＆＃39;为您的文学和哲学知识而闻名。还有其他艺术对你绘画或音乐有意义吗？</p><p> JLB: Well, I&#39;m very ignorant of music. I can only plead the doctrine of invincible ignorance. But when we were writing, Bioy Casares and I, we were hearing records. And then we found out there were some records that stimulated us, that gave us a sense of power, of passion, of might. So we wrote better when we were hearing them. Then we found out where those records came from. And they were records by Brahms. And that&#39;s all I know of music. There my knowledge stops. But in a sense I should be grateful to Brahms. Because I feel a stronger and happier man and a more passionate man when I am hearing his music. So I suppose I should thank him for that gift. But, of course, I cannot understand that gift or explain it.</p><p> JLB：嗯，我非常无知的音乐。我只能恳求无敌无知的教义。但是，当我们写作，Bioy Casares和我时，我们正在听到记录。然后我们发现有一些刺激我们的记录，这给了我们可能的激情感受到的力量。所以我们在听到他们时写得更好。然后我们发现这些记录来自哪里。他们是Brahms的记录。而且，我所知道的音乐所知的所有＆＃39。我的知识停止了。但是，在某种意义上，我应该感激勃拉姆斯。因为当我听到他的音乐时，我觉得一个更强大而更快乐的人和一个更激情的人。所以我想我应该感谢他的礼物。但是，当然，我无法理解礼物或解释它。</p><p> CW: Mr. Borges, one subject very rarely, if at all, shows up in your work, and that is sex. What would you say was the reason for that?</p><p> CW：Borges先生，一个主题很少，如果有的话，在你的工作中出现，这是性的。你会说什么是这个原因？</p><p> JLB: I suppose the reason is that I think too much about it. When I write, I try to get away from personal feelings. I suppose that&#39;s the reason. But there has to be another reason. The other reason may be that it&#39;s been worked to death, and I know that I can&#39;t say anything new or very interesting about it. Of course, you may say that the other subjects I treat have also been worked to death. For example, loneliness, identity. And yet, somehow I feel that I can do more with the problems of time and identity than with what was treated by Blake when he spoke of &#34;weaving through dreams a sexual strife, and weeping o&#39;er the web of life.&#34; Well, I wonder if I have woven through dreams the sexual strife. I don&#39;t think so. But after all, my business is to weave dreams. I suppose I may be allowed to choose the material.</p><p> JLB：我想原因是我认为太多了。当我写的时候，我试图摆脱个人感受。我想这个原因。但必须有另一个原因。另一个原因可能是它＆＃39;曾经曾经致死过死亡，我知道我可以＆＃39; t对它说出任何新的或非常有趣的东西。当然，您可以说我治疗的其他主题也被致死。例如，寂寞，身份。然而，不知何故，我觉得我可以在时间和身份的问题中做得更多，而不是在＆＃34谈话时由布莱克对待的事情。通过梦想进行性冲突，哭泣o＆＃39;呃网生活。＆＃34;好吧，我想知道我是否通过梦想来磨损性冲突。我不这么认为。但毕竟，我的业务是编织梦想。我想我可能被允许选择材料。</p><p> CW: In an interview for the  Paris Review you were mocking the concern about the audience you reach. And you were saying that, only 37 copies of your first book had been sold, and that…you liked that because you could identify yourself with 37 people.</p><p> CW：在接受巴黎的采访中，您正在嘲笑您到达的观众的关注。而且你这么说，只有37份书的副本被销售，而且......你喜欢，因为你可以用37人识别自己。</p><p> JLB: Because after all, if you sell a thousand copies you might as well sell no copy at all, no? Infinity and zero come together. But 37 people—with faces, with circumstances, with likes, with dislikes, with relatives and so on. So I was very grateful when I had sold 37 copies. But I think I was exaggerating, it may have been 21 only, or 17 for that matter.</p><p> JLB：因为毕竟，如果你卖一千份你可能出售没有副本，没有？无限和零汇集在一起​​。但是，37人 - 面对面，有这种情况，有喜欢的，不喜欢，亲戚等。所以我在卖37份时非常感激。但我想我夸大了，可能已经21岁了，或者17件重要。</p><p> CW: But is it really of little concern to you to reach a large audience?</p><p> CW：但是你达到了大量受众的关注真的很少吗？ </p><p> JLB: I think that what I&#39;m really concerned about is reaching one person. And that person may be myself for all I know. In my country writers hardly worry about audiences. Perhaps because they know they&#39;ll never get any. Not out of modesty, but self-knowledge. But I think it&#39;s all to the good that a writer shouldn&#39;t be too famous. Because, in a country where a writer may be famous, he may be pandering to the mob, celebrity and so on. But in my country, I write for myself, and perhaps for half a dozen friends. And that should be enough. And that might improve the quality of my writing. But if I were writing for thousands of people, then I would write what might please them. And as I know nothing about them, and maybe I&#39;d have a rather low opinion of them, I don&#39;t think that would do any good to my work.</p><p>jlb：我认为我真的关心的是什么是到达一个人。那个人可能是我所知道的一切。在我的国家作家几乎没有担心受众。也许是因为他们知道他们＆＃39; ll永远不会得到任何。不是谦虚，而是自我知识。但我认为这是一个作家＆＃39; t太着名的善良。因为，在一个作家可能出名的国家，他可能会加入暴徒，名人等。但在我的国家，我为自己写，也许是半十个朋友。那应该足够了。这可能会提高我的写作质量。但是，如果我正在写成千上万的人，那么我会写出可能的东西。当我对他们都不了解，也许我对他们有一个相当低的意见，我不认为这会对我的工作做好事。</p><p> CW: There are many of us who are afraid about the directions that art—or the arts in general—have been taken most recently, and there&#39;s the feeling that there may be a dehumanization in the arts, to use Ortega&#39;s term. Do you feel that danger?</p><p> CW：我们中有许多人害怕艺术 - 或艺术一般的方向 - 已经被最近，并且在那里的感觉中可能有艺术中可能存在的疏忽，使用ortega＆＃ 39;术语。你觉得这个危险吗？</p><p> JLB: Well I see no reason whatever why that danger should be especially active today. After all, there are thousands of people writing away, and if we evolve one or two writers, that should be enough. I mean, we&#39;re always thinking highly of the past, because we say Shakespeare, Marlowe and so on. But after all, we are thinking of the ones who have come down to us. I suppose that in any special time art must have been really quite rubbishy. But if we manage to evolve one or two writers, and those writers should be thought worthy of being read in time to come, I don&#39;t think we need worry about there being many quite bad writers.</p><p> JLB：好吧，我没有理由，无论为什么今天应该特别活跃。毕竟，有成千上万的人写作，如果我们演变一两个作家，那应该足够了。我的意思是，我们始终思考过去，因为我们说莎士比亚，马洛等。但毕竟，我们正在考虑那些归结为我们的人。我想在任何特殊的时间艺术中一定是非常棘手的。但如果我们设法进化一个或两个作家，那么这些作家应该被认为是值得回报的，我不认为我们需要担心有许多相当糟糕的作家。</p><p> CW: I was thinking not so much of the quantity of bad writers but the direction in which perhaps even good art or so-called good art is going, which seems to become progressively beset by scientific or anti-intellectual or self-destructive values, which might in time lead to a preponderance of anti-art.</p><p> CW：我在思考不那么大量的坏作家数量，而是甚至可能是良好的艺术或所谓的好艺术的方向，这似乎通过科学或反思的或自我破坏性的价值观逐渐变痛，这可能会导致反艺术的优势。</p><p> JLB: Well I wonder if you&#39;re thinking, let&#39;s say, of art being written in a very special way. For example, of literature being merely verbal. Or painting merely concerned with shapes, with lines, with certain patterns.</p><p> JLB：我想知道你是否＆＃39;重新思考，让＆＃39; s说，艺术以一种非常特殊的方式编写。例如，文学仅仅是口头。或绘画仅仅关注形状，具有线条，具有某些模式。</p><p> But I think that something should come through in spite of the artist&#39;s theories. Suppose a writer may think that he&#39;s writing meaningless verse, or that he&#39;s only out, let&#39;s say, for verbal patterns, and at the same time he may be saying something, or rather suggesting something, very meaningful. Because art is very mysterious. I wonder if you can really do any damage to art. I think that to have that opinion is to think too highly of reason. I think that when we&#39;re writing, something comes through or should come through, in spite of our theories. So theories are not really important. I don&#39;t think esthetic schools are important. What is important is the use that is made of them, or whatever the individual writer does. I&#39;m not interested in the fact that a writer may label himself as being intellectual or anti-intellectual. l&#39;m really interested in the stuff he&#39;s turning out.</p><p> 但我认为尽管艺术家＆＃39的理论，事情应该通过。假设一个作家可能会认为他写了毫无意义的诗句，或者他唯一的，让＆＃39; s说，对于口头模式，同时他可能会说些什么，或者宁愿暗示一些东西，非常有意义。因为艺术非常神秘。我想知道你是否可以对艺术做任何伤害。我认为这是认为这意见是过于思考的理由。我认为当我们写作时，尽管我们的理论，事情通过或应该通过。所以理论并不重要。我不认为美学学校很重要。重要的是由它们制成的使用，或者无论个别作家都这样做。我对作家可能将自己标记为知识分子或反思的事实不感兴趣。 L＆＃39; m对他的东西真的很感兴趣。</p><p> CW: At this point, what are you attracted to—where is your sense of adventure leading you now?</p><p> CW：此时，你吸引了什么 - 你现在的冒险感是什么？ </p><p> JLB: Well, I have several plans. One of them is to write a volume of straightforward stories. I think I&#39;m rather tired of mazes and mirrors and people who are somebody else. And I was rereading some months ago the  Plain Tales From the Hills, these very straightforward stories that Kipling wrote when he was a young man­ afterward, of course, he went on to very intricate schemes—and I thought I would try my hand at writing a straightforward story, and I wrote one. And I&#39;m thinking of writing more stories in that style. I mean stories with simple characters—if there be such a thing as a simple character. That&#39;s one of my plans. And the other plan would be to write a book on Old English and Old Norse literature. Not a book of information, but rather a book with my personal opinions, a book wherein I try to say what I thought that poetry might have meant to the Saxons and to the Norsemen. So that I have those two books in mind.</p><p>JLB：嗯，我有几个计划。其中一个是写一卷直接的故事。我想我＆＃39; m们厌倦了迷宫和镜子和别人的人。几个月前，我在山上的普通故事，这些非常简单的故事，当然是一个年轻人的时候，他一直继续复杂的方案 - 我以为我会在写作中试试我的手一个直截了当的故事，我写了一个。和我＆＃39;我想在那种风格中写更多的故事。我的意思是具有简单字符的故事 - 如果有这样的事情作为一个简单的字符。那个＆＃39;我的计划之一。另一个计划是在旧英语和旧的诺尔文学中写一本书。不是一本信息的书，而是一本书，我的个人意见，一本书，我试图说出我认为诗歌可能意味着撒克逊人和闻名。所以我有这两本书。</p><p> And also, perhaps, I&#39;ll fall back on my old schemes, because one never knows. I might write one or two fantastic stories. But I&#39;ll do my best to avoid them. I&#39;ll only write them down if they insist on my writing them.</p><p> 而且，也许，我＆＃39; ll回到我的旧方案上，因为一个人永远不知道。我可能会写一个或两个梦幻般的故事。但是我会尽力避开它们。我＆＃39;如果他们坚持我的写作，那么LL只会写下来。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/interview-jorge-luis-borges">https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/interview-jorge-luis-borges</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/令人困惑/">#令人困惑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/认为/">#认为</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
