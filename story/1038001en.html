In fact, all the cities of the western Netherlands were hungry. Railway workers and the country’s government in exile had defied German occupiers with a strike. In response, the Nazis significantly cut off the country’s most populated region from food supplies. The canals also froze, making transportation and escape impossible. What resulted was the “hunger winter,” a famine of unprecedented scale.</p><p>1944年冬天，海牙市开始饥饿。实际上，荷兰西部的所有城市都饿了。铁路工人和流亡国家的政府以罢工蔑视了德国占领者。作为回应，纳粹大大切断了该国人口最多的地区的粮食供应。运河也冻结了，使运输和逃逸成为不可能。结果是“饥饿的冬天”，一场前所未有的饥荒。</p><p> Solutions were few. Fuel ran out quickly, and some residents even ground up tulips to make flour. One group, however, wasn’t suffering as much as expected. In the Hague’s Juliana Children’s Hospital, pediatrician Willem Karel Dicke noticed that the children in his care with celiac disease were improving, even as they starved.</p><p> 解决方案很少。燃料很快用完，一些居民甚至磨碎郁金香制成面粉。但是，一组人的痛苦没有预期的那么大。在海牙的朱莉安娜儿童医院，儿科医生威廉·卡雷尔·迪克（Willem Karel Dicke）注意到，即使他饿了，在他照顾下的腹腔疾病患儿也正在好转。</p><p> Doctors had known about celiac for years. But there was no consensus on its cause, or how to treat it. It acquired its name in 100 A.D., when Greek* physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia was stumped by an ailment with symptoms of weakness, malnutrition, and diarrhea, which he dubbed  koiliakos.</p><p> 医生已经知道乳糜泻多年。但是，关于其病因或治疗方法尚未达成共识。它在公元100年获得了自己的名字，当时希腊*的卡帕多细亚医生Aretaeus患上了虚弱，营养不良和腹泻等症状的疾病，他称其为koiliakos。</p><p> Today, celiac disease is known to be a genetic autoimmune disorder. Those afflicted have a severe reaction to gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat. It can be a challenge to diagnose, but once identified, the treatment is simple: eating a diet free of gluten.</p><p> 今天，已知腹腔疾病是遗传性自身免疫性疾病。患病的人对面筋有严重的反应，面筋是一种在小麦等谷物中发现的蛋白质。诊断可能是一个挑战，但一旦确定，治疗方法就很简单：吃不含麸质的饮食。</p><p> But at the dawn of modern medicine, celiac remained a frustrating mystery to doctors. Even worse, the disease had the greatest effect on children. Celiac was often a death sentence. By inflaming the small intestine and causing malnutrition, the disease could irreparably stunt physical growth and mental development. Children with advanced celiac disease had horrifying symptoms: rashes, withered limbs, and large swollen bellies, like famine victims.</p><p> 但是在现代医学出现之初，腹腔对于医生来说仍然是一个令人沮丧的谜。更糟糕的是，这种疾病对儿童的影响最大。腹腔通常是死刑。通过使小肠发炎并引起营养不良，该疾病可能无法弥补的身体发育和智力发育受到阻碍。患有晚期乳糜泻的儿童表现出可怕的症状：皮疹，四肢枯萎和腹部大肿胀，如饥荒受害者。</p><p> By the time Dicke entered the field, others had already been working on a remedy. Doctors observing children with celiac eventually ruled out a bacteriological source, especially since it seemed to affect children from all backgrounds. In fact, it particularly affected wealthy children. (Although one doctor, Christian Archibald Herter, theorized that poorer children succumbed too quickly  for a diagnosis.)</p><p> 到Dicke进入该领域时，其他人已经在研究补救方法。观察患有乳糜泻儿童的医生最终排除了细菌来源，特别是因为它似乎影响了所有背景的儿童。实际上，它特别影响了有钱的孩子。 （尽管有一位医生克里斯蒂安·阿奇博尔德·赫特（Christian Archibald Herter）认为较贫穷的孩子屈服得太快而无法诊断。）</p><p>  One thing actually seemed to work: a banana diet. Sydney Haas, an American doctor, started promoting bananas as a cure in 1924, believing that complex carbohydrates, such as starch, were the culprits. Ripe bananas contain nearly no starch. Luckily for children with celiac, they also contain no gluten. Haas’s theory was widely disseminated, and it received so much support from banana companies that fellow doctors accused him of advertising  on their behalf. Parents frantically sought the fruit for their “banana babies.” Though he likely saved many lives, Haas incorrectly believed his banana diet resulted in a permanent cure. Adults with the disease reintroduced wheat and other  grains into their diets, often with deleterious effects.</p><p>  实际上似乎有一件事情起作用：香蕉饮食。美国医生悉尼·哈斯（Sydney Haas）于1924年开始推广香蕉作为治疗方法，他认为罪魁祸首是复杂的碳水化合物，例如淀粉。成熟的香蕉几乎不含淀粉。幸运的是，对于患有腹腔炎的儿童，它们也不含麸质。哈斯的理论得到了广泛传播，并得到了香蕉公司的大力支持，以至于其他医生指责他代表他们做广告。父母疯狂地为“香蕉宝宝”寻求果实。尽管哈斯可能挽救了许多生命，但哈斯错误地认为他的香蕉饮食可以永久治愈。患有这种疾病的成年人通常将小麦和其他谷物重新添加到饮食中，这通常具有有害作用。 </p><p> Dicke, a pediatrician, had long suspected that wheat was the main celiac offender. In 1932, he attended a meeting of the Dutch Society for Pediatrics, where another doctor presented a medicinal powder to combat celiac. However, the powder was sometimes administered alongside bread and marmalade. Dicke noticed that relapses corresponded with the bread. In 1936, the same year he became the director of the Juliana Children’s Hospital at age 31, he began a long-running observation of a child with celiac. The boy ate wheat-free while at the hospital. But when he returned home, the boy’s parents reintroduced a  typical diet against Dicke’s wishes. When Dicke mapped the boy’s growth patterns, they corresponded to his time spent at home and at the hospital.</p><p>儿科医生迪克（Dicke）长期以来一直怀疑小麦是主要的腹腔疾病。 1932年，他参加了荷兰儿科学会的一次会议，另一位医生介绍了一种用于治疗腹腔疾病的药用粉末。但是，这种粉末有时与面包和果酱一起服用。迪克注意到复发与面包相对应。 1936年，即他31岁时担任朱莉安娜儿童医院的主任的那一年，他开始对一个患有腹腔炎的孩子进行长期观察。这个男孩在医院时不吃小麦。但是当他回到家时，男孩的父母违背了迪克的意愿重新采用了典型的饮食方式。当Dicke绘制男孩的成长模式时，它们与他在家里和医院度过的时间相对应。</p><p> But war was looming. In 1940, Germany occupied the Netherlands, and the next few years were brutal. The Nazi-led occupying forces killed resistance fighters and civilians, and deported most of the nation’s Jewish population to concentration camps. Meanwhile, Dicke chipped away at his theory. Months into the Nazi occupation, he presented a speech to the Dutch Society of Pediatrics. In it, he observed that the banana diet popularized by Haas did ward off celiac. But there was one problem: The wartime Netherlands had no bananas, and the whole country was under strict rationing. He proposed the following alternative: absolutely no bread, the occasional biscuit, and “sweet or sour porridge” that had no wheat flour.</p><p> 但是战争迫在眉睫。 1940年，德国占领了荷兰，接下来的几年是残酷的。纳粹领导的占领军杀死了抵抗战士和平民，并将该国大多数犹太人驱逐到集中营。同时，迪克（Dicke）打破了他的理论。纳粹占领几个月后，他向荷兰儿科学会发表了演讲。在其中，他观察到哈斯（Haas）推广的香蕉饮食确实可以抵御腹腔疾病。但是有一个问题：战时荷兰没有香蕉，整个国家都受到严格的配给。他提出了以下替代方案：绝对没有面包，偶尔的饼干和没有小麦粉的“糖醋粥”。</p><p>  One person best remembers Dicke during this time: his son, Karel A. Dicke, a hematologist and oncologist now living in Texas. Dicke describes his father as a driven leader with a calm facade, and he says his father fought against the occupation. (He also describes his mother as a “powerhouse” who joined the Dutch resistance and sent information on minefields and German defenses to London.) When Karel was a small child, his father was arrested for hiding stranded Allied pilots in the hospital basement. “He was betrayed, and the Germans took him to prison,” Karel says. He wasn’t shot only because the city needed doctors, especially pediatricians.</p><p>  在这段时间里，一个人最能记住Dicke：他的儿子Karel A. Dicke，现在居住在德克萨斯州的血液学家和肿瘤学家。迪克形容他的父亲是一个镇定自若的领导者，他说他的父亲反对占领。 （他还形容他的母亲是“强者”，加入了荷兰抵抗军，并向伦敦发送了雷区和德国防卫信息。）卡雷尔还是个小孩时，他的父亲因在医院地下室藏匿滞留的盟军飞行员而被捕。卡雷尔说：“他被出卖了，德国人将他送进了监狱。”他之所以被枪杀，不仅仅是因为该市需要医生，尤其是儿科医生。</p><p> 1944 was the beginning of the end of the war. In September, the exiled Dutch royals ordered a railroad strike, which was meant to hinder German troop transport. Liberation seemed so close that 65,000 Dutch collaborators fled to Germany. In retaliation, Germany halted supplies into the western Netherlands. Food dwindled quickly, and soon the Dutch were eating tiny amounts of bread, potatoes, and sugar beets. “Nothing was so important as food,” wrote survivor and journalist  Henri A. Van Der Zee. “I remember getting up in the morning thinking of food: the whole day long we talked about food; and I went to bed hungry and dreaming of food.”</p><p> 1944年是战争结束的开始。 9月，流亡的荷兰皇室下令下令进行铁路罢工，以阻止德国部队的运输。解放似乎是如此紧密，以至于有65,000名荷兰合作者逃往德国。为了报复，德国停止了向荷兰西部的补给。食物迅速减少，不久荷兰人就吃了少量的面包，土豆和甜菜。幸存者和记者亨利·范德泽（Henri A. Van Der Zee）写道：“没有什么东西比食物重要。” “我记得早上起床时想起食物：整天我们都在谈论食物。我饿着肚子上床睡觉，梦见食物。”</p><p> While the Allies slowly liberated southern areas of the Netherlands, Nazis tightly controlled the west. Approaching the hospital was “a minefield,” Karel recalls. Within the hospital, Dicke’s wife later explained, her husband ordered tulip bulbs in for  patients to eat. This was risky: Tulip bulbs have nearly no nutritional value, and they contain glycoside, which can be poisonous. But many Dutch had no choice, and 140 million bulbs were  eaten throughout the war. “Let me tell you,” Karel says, “it’s better to have tulips in the backyard than to eat them.”</p><p> 盟军缓慢解放荷兰南部地区时，纳粹却严格控制了西部地区。卡雷尔回忆说，接近医院是“雷区”。迪克的妻子后来解释说，在医院里，她的丈夫订购了郁金香灯泡供患者食用。这是有风险的：郁金香鳞茎几乎没有营养价值，并且它们含有可能有毒的糖苷。但是许多荷兰人别无选择，整个战争期间吃掉了1.4亿只灯泡。卡雷尔说：“让我告诉你，在后院养郁金香比吃郁金香更好。”</p><p>  But to Dicke’s surprise, something remarkable happened. “To the [celiac] children, the shortage of food was less severe than the toxic effects of wheat products,” he reported. Karel remembers that while other children were “miserable” for the lack of bread, his father’s celiac patients were thriving. When there was  beschuit, or twice-baked bread, the children became sick once more. “There was a clear-cut difference,” Karel says. The mortality rate of children in the Netherlands with celiac fell during the food shortage from  35 percent to nearly zero.</p><p>  但是令迪克感到惊讶的是，发生了一件了不起的事情。他报告说：“对[celiac]儿童而言，食物短缺的严重程度不及小麦产品的毒性。”卡雷尔（Karel）记得，虽然其他孩子因缺少面包而“痛苦”，但他父亲的腹腔疾病患者却在蓬勃发展。当有面包或两次烘烤的面包时，孩子们又生病了。 “有明显的区别，”卡雷尔说。在粮食短缺期间，荷兰患有腹腔炎的儿童死亡率从35％下降到几乎为零。</p><p> On April 29, 1945, Allied forces began airdropping supplies to hungry Dutch citizens. The liberation of the Netherlands, led by Canadian forces, was finalized on May 5. “It was not raining bombs, it rained bread,” Karel recalls reverentially. He and his brother were thrilled. The first American Karel met in the Hague was a black soldier, the first black person he had ever seen. The soldier carried him on his shoulders through the celebrating city. “His name was John,” Karel says. “It was maybe a 15 minute encounter. I will never forget it.”</p><p> 1945年4月29日，盟军开始向饥饿的荷兰公民空投补给物资。由加拿大军队领导的荷兰解放于5月5日完成。“这不是在下炸弹，是在下雨面包，”卡雷尔虔诚地回忆道。他和他的兄弟很兴奋。第一次在海牙遇见的美国人卡雷尔是黑人士兵，这是他见过的第一个黑人。那个士兵把他扛在了庆祝城市的肩膀上。 “他的名字叫约翰，”卡雷尔说。 “也许是15分钟的encounter。我永远不会忘记。” </p><p> Though the family had a terrifying wartime experience, they recovered. “We all survived, so we counted our blessings,” he says. But children once more began suffering from celiac disorder. Dicke, who contemporaries considered a vigorous scientist, embarked on five years of research to prove and record what he had observed during the war. In 1948, using five test subjects, Dicke provided different cereals for them to eat, carefully measuring patient weight and examining feces for fat absorption. In 1950, Dicke published his findings that wheat and rye flour  aggravated celiac symptoms. Importantly, he also gave the children wheat starch to no ill effect, discounting the theory that complex carbohydrates were the cause. With the help of other colleagues, he later pinpointed gluten  as the ultimate culprit.</p><p>尽管一家人经历了可怕的战时经历，但他们康复了。他说：“我们所有人都活了下来，所以我们数了幸事。”但是孩子们再次开始患有乳糜泻。当时被认为是一位朝气蓬勃的科学家的迪克，开始了为期五年的研究，以证明和记录他在战争中所观察到的一切。 1948年，Dicke使用五个测试对象为他们提供了不同的谷类食物供他们食用，仔细测量患者的体重并检查粪便中的脂肪吸收情况。 1950年，迪克发表了他的发现，即小麦和黑麦面粉加重了腹腔症状。重要的是，他还给孩子们小麦淀粉没有不良影响，不赞成复杂碳水化合物是病因的理论。在其他同事的帮助下，他后来将面筋确定为罪魁祸首。</p><p>  Almost immediately, writes Emily K. Abel in her paper  The Rise and Fall of Celiac Disease in the United States, doctors reproduced Dicke’s results and gluten-free diets became the standard treatment for celiac in Europe and Australia. Adoption was much slower in the United States, though, as the banana treatment remained the norm due to the influence of Haas, who dismissed Dicke’s discovery. During a 1947 visit to America, Dicke told doctors about his theory. “Nobody believed him,”  a colleague later said. Many cases of celiac in the U.S. still go undiagnosed.</p><p>  艾米丽·K·阿贝尔（Emily K. Abel）在其论文《美国腹腔疾病的兴衰》中几乎立即写道，医生再现了迪克的研究结果，无麸质饮食成为欧洲和澳大利亚的腹腔疾病的标准治疗方法。不过，在美国收养的速度要慢得多，因为由于哈斯（Haas）的影响，香蕉治疗仍然是常态，哈斯驳斥了迪克的发现。在1947年访问美国期间，迪克向医生介绍了他的理论。一位同事后来说：“没人相信他。”在美国，许多腹腔疾病仍未得到诊断。</p><p> The Netherlands Society of Gastroenterology drew up an award for outstanding work in the field, and the first Dicke Medal was given to Dicke. But he was almost awarded a greater honor: the Nobel Prize for Medicine. The committee discussed a Nobel for Dicke in 1962. A week later, however, Dicke died at the age of 57. Nobel Prizes, unfortunately, are not awarded posthumously.</p><p> 荷兰胃肠病学学会因在该领域的杰出工作而获奖，第一个迪克奖章授予了迪克。但是他几乎被授予了更大的荣誉：诺贝尔医学奖。委员会于1962年为迪克讨论了诺贝尔奖。但是一周后，迪克去世，享年57岁。不幸的是，诺贝尔奖没有被追授。</p><p> But Dicke was a humble man, and Karel says he wouldn’t have wanted the prize. Dicke had known he had a terminal case of cerebrovascular disease, and that knowledge hung over them both as Karel shadowed his father as a young medical student. Karel remembers his father dismissing the award as unimportant. Instead, Karel says, Dicke would have appreciated that millions of people thrive while living with celiac today. Ultimately, Karel sums up his father’s life in a few words. “For the children,” he says. “For the hospital. For medicine. For Holland. And for us as a family.”</p><p> 但是迪克是个谦虚的人，卡雷尔说他不会想要这个奖项。迪克知道他患有脑血管疾病的绝症，而当卡雷尔（Karel）遮蔽他年轻的医学院学生的父亲时，这两种知识都笼罩在他们身上。卡雷尔（Karel）记得他的父亲认为该奖项不重要。卡雷尔说，取而代之的是，迪克会感激今天有数以百万计的人在与腹腔疾病一起生活时壮成长。最终，卡雷尔用几句话总结了父亲的生活。他说：“为了孩子们。” “对于医院。用于医学。对于荷兰。对于我们一家人来说。”</p><p>  Gastro Obscura covers the world’s most wondrous food and drink.
