Today, gamers and history buffs can try their hand at rudimentary arcade warfare online at the  Museum of Soviet Arcade Games.\n  &#34;The Zaporozhets, the Soviets&#39; answer to Fiat 600, was the cheapest car on the market\u2014its head engineer had said that the price cutoff was &#39;1000 bottles of vodka,&#39;&#34; Idov says. &#34;Its idiosyncrasies\u2014engine in the back, comically ear-like air intakes, an optional hatch in the floor for ice fishing\u2014made it the butt of countless jokes. These days, there&#39;s a whole community devoted to loopy modifications of old &#39;Zapors.&#39; Vladimir Putin, proud owner of a 1972 model, is reportedly a member.&#34;\n  Thanks to this battery-powered driving game, those too young to own a Zaporozhets could enjoy Soviet car culture. &#34;The car actually stayed in place, held down by a magnet; it was the road itself that spun around it, like a vinyl platter,&#34; Idov says. &#34;Homemade hacks included replacing the car with a bolt or teaspoon and flipping the battery&#39;s polarity\u2014which made the whole board spin backward.&#34;\n  &#34;This portable water heater\u2014the better to make tea or bouillon in the privacy of your hotel room\u2014was a must for every Soviet traveler,&#34; Idov says. &#34;Russians abroad had a reputation for shorting out whole city blocks by plugging these babies into 110-volt sockets. The infinitely more terrifying homemade version consisted of an electrical cord, two matchsticks and two razor blades.&#34;\n  &#34;A wire radio receiver\u2014 radiotochka, literally &#34;radio point&#34;\u2014was a quintessentially Soviet object: a wall-mounted radio that broadcast only one channel, couldn&#39;t be turned off (only down) and came pre-installed in almost every apartment built after WWII,&#34; Idov says. &#34;Ironically, its very severity\u2014one knob, no buttons\u2014led to some pretty striking designs.&#34;\n  Soviet style has a reputation for being utilitarian and boring. &#34;But it was not all about khaki and putty, as evidenced by the eye-popping colors of this cheapo 1980s tape deck,&#34; Idov says.\n  &#34;The Soviets were not above marketing their consumer goods to the West,&#34; Idov says &#34;This ad from the early 1960s uses the Sputnik to boldly hawk Soviet radios; at least whoever dreamed up the accompanying English copy has managed to get the chirpy  Mad Men\u2013era cadence right.&#34;\n  &#34;In the early 1960s, humbled by the Yanks at the &#39;Kitchen Debates,&#39; Khrushchev&#39;s government had created VNIITE, a &#39;technical aesthetics research institute&#39; that was basically a state-run design shop,&#34; Idov says. &#34;None of its work made it into mass production, but at least its journal,  Tekhnicheskaya Estetika, became a hit.&#34;\n  This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

So we\u2019re very happy to announce EventBus 3.1 today. Starting with this release, EventBus works with  plain Java (non-Android) projects. This has two major benefits: Firstly, it opens up EventBus for all Java developers and makes it usable for server and desktop applications. Secondly, it allows Android developers to use EventBus in  local unit tests. Before, you had to use instrumentation tests which are slow and require a device. In contrast to this, plain Java unit tests are blazingly fast as they run directly on your desktop machine.   The second improvement is a new thread mode:  MAIN_ORDERED. It is a variation of the default MAIN thread mode and also ensures event delivery in the main thread. The difference is when an event is posted in the main thread: with MAIN it will pass on the event to subscribers immediately in a synchronous fashion. MAIN_ORDERED will only enqueue the event in the call to \r\t\t\t   post ( . . . ) for later delivery to subscribers. This gives event processing a stricter and more consistent order (thus the name MAIN_ORDERED). For example if you post another event in an event handler with MAIN thread mode, the second event handler will finish before the first one (because it is called synchronously \u2013 compare it to a method call). With MAIN_ORDERED, the first event handler would finish, and then the second one will be invoked at a later point in time (as soon as the main thread has capacity).\n We are considering making MAIN_ORDERED the default in a future version of EventBus. Because MAIN and MAIN_ORDERED behave slightly different, there may be some cases where this also may change an app\u2019s behavior. It\u2019s a trade off in every case: MAIN is faster when events are posted on the main thread and MAIN_ORDERED offers more consistent and predictable event delivery.

The massive demand from the Japanese\rhas created a huge market for such items, and no one questions them very\rclosely.\n What I found particularly amusing was that, as you can see above, one of\rthe main characters is named Frank; the student\u2019s responses\rrepeatedly referred to this character as \u201cCandid\u201d (which,\rabove, was further mutated into \u201ccandidate\u201d).\u2009\rAnd the plagiarism detection software was indeed fooled!\u2009\rWhat the student didn\u2019t realize is that teachers don\u2019t need\rsoftware to be able to tell the difference between honestly composed\rsentences and computer-generated gibberish.\n Another thing I\u2019ve discovered is that many\rstudents\u2014\u200bnot just a couple here and there, but several in\revery class\u2014\u200bconsistently use umlauts in place of quotation\rmarks and acute accent marks in place of apostrophes.\u2009\rFor instance, here\u2019s a student recapping an issue of Scott\rMcCloud\u2019s  Zot!:\n Brandy says, \u00a8\u200bwho wants to go out with me?\u200b\u00a8 All\rthe boys yell \u00a8\u200bME, ME, ME\u200b\u00a8.\rBrandy\u200b\u00b4\u200bs first date was with Spike at his house.\rWoody calls Spike and tells him that it\u200b\u00b4\u200bs his turn to\rdate Brandy.

Woody ask her\rif she is feeling right and she says \u00a8\u200byes\u200b\u00a8.\n I don\u2019t know how this happens\u2014\u200bI had to do some poking\raround on character code tables just to figure out how to replicate the\reffect.\u2009\rWhat\u2019s more interesting to me is the students\u2019 confusion when\rI point out that, hey, those aren\u2019t quotation marks.\u2009\rIt suggests that they haven\u2019t read enough books with conventional\rtypography to have internalized what quotation marks and apostrophes\ractually look like in print.\n Ellie reports overhearing some high school girls at the bus stop\rtalking about  The Great Gatsby:\n \u201cNot really. The one thing I know is that the main character\rgoes by he/him pronouns\u201d\n That one is pretty much impossible to beat, but here was an honorable\rmention from the same conversation:\n \u201cNah, which is good because I just look for when weird things\rare happening and then write slang words she won\u2019t get like\r\u2018oh shit\u2019 and \u2018what the fuck\u2019\u201d\n Ellie was struck by the way this kid seemed concerned not that she would\rget in trouble for cursing in a school assignment but rather that the\rteacher would be baffled by such esoteric slang.\u2009\rDid she really think that the words \u201cshit\u201d and\r\u201cfuck\u201d were coined by zoomers?\n Meanwhile, here\u2019s what it\u2019s like in the teacher email\rthreads.\u2009\rThis is a verbatim, non-ironic quote:\n \u201cI didn\u2019t really hear you at first, steeped as I am in a\rculture of assumed patriarchal white privilege, rank privilege, and\rinequitable hierarchy.\u201d\n The school where I\u2019ve been teaching is notorious for its\rextremely lax attitude toward student discipline.\u2009\rBack when we were still on campus full time, rarely did a week go by\rwithout the fire alarm interrupting classes.\u2009\rThis was usually due to someone smoking in a bathroom, but one time\rduring my student teaching year it turned out that someone had tried to\rset one of the buildings on fire deliberately.\u2009\rOne of the vice principals came on the intercom a couple of days later\rto announce that the school was taking a zero-tolerance stance toward\rarson.\u2009\r\u201cWe will impose the harshest possible penalty,\u201d she declared:\r\u201cFive days of on-campus suspension!\u201d\u2009\rMy mentor teacher burst out laughing.\u2009\r\u201cThat makes it official\u2014\u200bthere is literally nothing you\rcan do to get expelled from this school,\u201d he mused.\u2009\rBut that sort of thing actually has less of an effect on the overall\rculture of the school than day-to-day issues like the lack of consequences\rfor tardiness.\u2009\rMost teachers seem to take it as a given that of\r course half the class is going to wander in half an\rhour late during first period\u2014\u200bit\u2019s so early, you\rknow!\u2014\u200b and during fourth period,\rbecause you know how long those lines can get at the lunch places the kids\rall go to, halfway across town.\u2009\rI\u2019ve sometimes even had to remind myself that, hey, wait, when I was\rin school, class started when the bell rang because everyone was\rthere!\u2009\rOf course, it\u2019s different at a suburban school where parents are\rdriving their kids to the front gate instead of leaving them to get there\rby their own devices, except wait no it isn\u2019t because from age\rsixteen on my old classmates were generally driving themselves.\u2009\rIt really is a matter of school culture.\n And this culture affects academics as well.\u2009\rPrior to the arrival of the covids, my program had a no-homework policy:\rif I wanted my students to write an essay, I had to block off a full week\rof class time so they could write it at their desks, and even assigning a\rbook meant that I had to either spend a month reading it out loud all the\rway through or at least devote big chunks of every class to silent\rreading.\u2009\r(I did a count of the number of books I was assigned in my last two years\rof high school English classes, and I came up with\r\t twenty-three.\u2009\rI assigned three per year and had parents emailing me to thank me for\rthe academic rigor of my class, as apparently a number of teachers\rweren\u2019t assigning any books at all.)\u2009\rWith the move to distance learning came state-mandated homework minutes,\rbut soon the directives from the school in this regard became a confusing\rmishmash of \u201cyou\u2019re legally required to assign this much\rhomework, so make sure you do that, only don\u2019t, because the kids\rare overwhelmed\u201d.\u2009\rThat too was in keeping with a theme.\u2009\rThe teacher email I mentioned above was from one of the conference\rthreads, but the emails sent to me personally from counselors and\radministrators have overwhelmingly broken down along these lines:\rsuch-and-such a student is feeling stressed, so please excuse her\rfrom this set of assignments.\u2009\rThis other student gets nervous about taking tests or giving presentations\ror working in groups, so please excuse him from work of those types.\u2009\rAnother initiative headed for mandate status is a school policy that no\rassignment can receive a grade of less than 50%, even if it was never\rturned in, the idea being that if you blow off all your work for months\ron end and then decide, with two weeks in the semester, that you actually\rdo want to pass the class, seeing that you have a zero is too\rdiscouraging.\u2009\rIt goes without saying that in tandem with this came a corollary that\rlate work must be accepted right up to the end of the term.\u2009\rAnd my direct supervisor repeatedly demanded that I pace my classes for\rthe benefit of the single student in each section who was struggling the\rmost, which quite literally would have meant putting students who had\rsigned up for Advanced Placement into a remedial course.\u2009\rColleagues from programs where these moves happened earlier have pointed\rout what the results have been: kids wind up with stellar grade point\raverages and glowing recommendations, get into top colleges, and\u2026\rdrop out after about three weeks, saying that they feel like they\u2019re\ryears behind everyone else and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\rbecause they are and they don\u2019t.\n Early in my previous career teaching test prep, a trainer told a story\rabout how during George\u00a0W. Bush\u2019s tenure as governor of Texas,\rthe state implemented a testing regime to identify students whose measured\rproficiency was not up to standard.\u2009\rAs it turned out, there were a lot: the first batch of test scores was\rabysmal.\u2009\rAnd so the state of Texas remedied this gap by\u2026 making the test\reasier.\u2009\rThe next time around, scores skyrocketed.\u2009\rProblem solved!\n Anyway, it turns out that you don\u2019t need to go to Texas for that\rsort of thing.\u2009\rWith half the term remaining, teachers of seniors received a notification\rthat they would not be allowed to fail students unless they filled out a\rform right then and there declaring that the student was\r certain to receive an F.\u2009\rSee how that works?\u2009\rFirst you require that teachers accept late work right up to the end of\rthe term; then you load up your \u201cF\u00a0Confirmation Form\u201d\rwith language indicating that only students \u201creceiving a\rguaranteed\u00a0F\u201d (at a point when nothing could possibly be\r\u201cguaranteed\u201d) and who will \u201cabsolutely get\ran\u00a0F\u201d and are \u201cdefinitely not going to pass\u201d\r(at a point when nothing could possibly be \u201cabsolute\u201d or\r\u201cdefinite\u201d) can be given failing grades.\u2009\rFailing grades are thus impossible.\u2009\rWow, a 100% pass rate!\u2009\rWhat a successful school!",

", "note_en": "| \r\t\t       I got an email from Google today with the title \u201cAn update to your Google Account\u201d.\n The gist of the email is that Google wants to change the country associated with my account, presumably based on recently recorded IP addresses associated with my account.\n  We associate your Google Account with a country (or region) so that we can better provide our services to you. This association is used to determine two things:The Google company that provides the services, processes your information and is responsible for complying with applicable privacy laws\n  The version of the Terms of Service that governs our relationship, which can vary depending on local laws.\n      Bear in mind that Google services are essentially the same, regardless of your country association. Also, any purchased content and banking information that you might have in your Google Account will remain the same.\n What I find curious is that it says the services are essentially the same between different countries. So, there is no advantage to me as a consumer for anything to change.\n There is a disadvantage for me, because the privacy laws in Europe are stronger than Asia, I lose some privacy protection. Is this a coincidence?\n I don\u2019t want to be cynical, but it seems suspicious to me. As someone who travels a lot (not recently!), I would never want this done automatically for me. This has never happened before, so it must be a recent policy change.\n I wonder if they will they make this change every few months in the future if I move around? Is there some criteria that triggers this to happen?\n Further in the email, it gives an indication of how you can request to correct your associated country:\n If the country associated with your account doesn\u2019t match your country of residence\u2026You can find more information about your country association, and a way to request a change if you think that it\u2019s wrong, by reviewing the Google Terms of Service.\n  After some searching, I found how to make a  Country Association Inquiry. It\u2019s just a short form where you pick your country and give a reason why this is a mistake. When you submit the form, it says something like \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you by email within a few weeks.\u201d\n Which will happen first? The automatic switching of the country association, or Google responding to my inquiry? It\u2019s going to be a race!\n   You recently sent us a request to change the country associated with your Google Account. After reviewing your account, we think your current country association is accurate and we didn\u2019t change anything.\n  Your country:MalaysiaYou can see the country associated with your account by looking at Google\u2019s Terms of Service.\n This may seem like busy work but I think it\u2019s important to do what you can to protect your privacy. If you do nothing, Google and others will erode your rights online if it correlates with increasing profits. If we don\u2019t pay attention and raise these kind of issues, then they might go unnoticed and may be considered bona-fide.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 23:23:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "google,update,\u56fd\u5bb6", "title": "\u60a8\u7684Google\u5e10\u6237\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u65b0 ", "title_en": "An unwanted update to your Google Account", "transed": 1, "url": "https://roboleary.net/2021/05/01/unwated-change-to-your-google-account.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "update", "\u56fd\u5bb6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066898, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f9d\u9760\u60a8\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u672c\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5e7f\u544a\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5e7f\u544a\u662f\u5141\u8bb8\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u768416\u5e74\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c3d\u529b\u786e\u4fdd\u53ea\u80fd\u6e05\u6d01\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u5e7f\u544a\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee4\u4eba\u8ba8\u538c\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u52aa\u529b\u5c3d\u5feb\u5220\u9664\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u67e5\u770b\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u652f\u6301\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bf7\u8003\u8651\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e7f\u544aPhoronix\u4fdd\u8d39\u3002\u60a8\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7PayPal\u8003\u8651\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u4ece70\u5e74\u4ee3\u540e\u671f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684Modula-2\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u523080\uff06\uff0339; s\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u57282021\u5e74\u770b\u5230\u4e3b\u7ebfGNU\u7f16\u8bd1\u96c6\u5408\uff08GCC\uff09\u652f\u6301\u3002\r   \u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8c03\u5236 -  2\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u662f\uff0c\u7531\u5c3c\u514b\u52b3\u65afWirth\u7684Eth\u82cf\u9ece\u4e16\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e5f\u4ee5\u6b27\u62c9\uff0c\u5e15\u65af\u5361\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u800c\u95fb\u540d\u3002 Modula-2\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eca\u5929\u7528\u9014\u4e0e\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff06\uff0339; s glonass\u536b\u661f\u3002\r   \u4e0e\u8bb8\u591a\u5176\u4ed6\u8c03\u5236-2\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e00\u8d77\uff0cGM2\uff06\uff0334; GNU Modula-2\uff06\uff0334;\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e3aGCC\u5e73\u53f0\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u73b0\u5728GM2\uff06\uff0339\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u4e86\u3002\u5728GCC\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0a\u6e38\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0a\u6e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5468\u56db\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06Modula-2 / GM2\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8865\u4e01\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e3b\u7ebfGC\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u3002\u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u6b64\u90ae\u4ef6\u5217\u8868\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u3002\r   GNU Modula-2\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Modula-2\u7684PIM2 / PIM3 / PIM4 / ISO\u65b9\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u524d\u7aef\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728X86 / x86_64\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u539f\u4e86AARCH64\u3002 ", "note_en": "We Rely On Your Support: This site is primarily supported by advertisements.

The Modula-2 programming language developed from the late 70&#39;s to 80&#39;s might finally see mainline GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) support in 2021.\r   The structured Modula-2 programming language is that out of ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth who is known for his work as well on Euler, Pascal and other programming languages. Modula-2 still has some uses today like with Russia&#39;s GLONASS satellites.\r   Alongside many other Modula-2 compilers, GM2 &#34;GNU Modula-2&#34; has been maintained for GCC platforms and now more than one decade after GM2&#39;s 1.0 release this front-end has been working on getting upstream in the GCC compiler.  A mailing list post was made on Thursday with the latest patches looking to get the Modula-2/GM2 support into the mainline GC code-base. See that mailing list post for all the technical details if interested.\r   The GNU Modula-2 code implements the PIM2 / PIM3 / PIM4 / ISO dialects of Modula-2 and the compiler front-end has been

", "note_en": "Five hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, in a bitter winter gale, a team of reindeer collapsed with exhaustion on the Siberian tundra. It was midwinter 1914. The sun had not risen for weeks; the air was hazy with diamond-hard snow. A furclad figure pulled her numb legs out of a buckskin bag, then struggled to get off her wooden sled as her guide admitted they were lost. Chilled and starving, Maria Czaplicka fantasized about killing one of the reindeer so that she could drink its warm, nourishing blood. She wondered if there was any hope of achieving her goal: to make contact with the Tungu people, known today as Evenks\u2014nomadic reindeer-herders who had never met a European woman.\n  Czaplicka is one of five fascinating, intrepid women pulled from the shadows of history by Frances Larson in \u201cUndreamed Shores: The Hidden Heroines of British Anthropology.\u201d Ms. Larson is an honorary research fellow in anthropology at Durham University in England. After completing her doctorate, she was a research associate at Oxford University\u2019s Pitt Rivers Museum, home of an extraordinary archaeological and anthropological collection. The museum was established in 1884, and a condition set by its benefactor, Gen. Augustus Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers, was that the university should appoint a lecturer in the new science of anthropology.\n  The discipline\u2019s male founders were eager to chart and categorize the world\u2019s cultures. At first, these museum-based anthropologists relied on travelers\u2019 reports and letters from missionaries for details of \u201cprimitive\u201d people\u2019s beliefs, ceremonies, appearance, houses, food and artifacts. They rarely thought it necessary to spend time with the people they studied. But once anthropology became a university course with its own lecturer, it needed students. Those students would help change the way that anthropological research was conducted.\n  As a new program, the anthropology diploma was more accessible to women than the established programs were. Between 1907 and 1918, 27 women (compared with 103 men) registered, joining the few hundred women studying at Oxford in the early 20th century who were barely acknowledged by their male peers and who could attend lectures only in chaperoned parties and on condition of silence. They were expected, Ms. Larson tells us, to be \u201cperipheral, clerical and grateful.\u201d The five women of \u201cUndreamed Shores\u201d overcame these attitudes and became Britain\u2019s first female anthropologists, achieving groundbreaking research in some of the most remote corners of the world.\n  Katherine Routledge, the daughter of a North England industrialist, commissioned her own boat and sailed to Easter Island, in the South Pacific, one of the most isolated communities in the world. There she compiled the first systematic map of the great stone statues that covered the island. Barbara Freire-Marreco, from a comfortable and conventional middle-class home in Surrey, worked and lived in the adobe pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona. She immersed herself, as no male anthropologist could have done, in the work expected of women in those communities\u2014maize-husking, needlework, the preparing of traditional medicines\u2014even as their way of life was eroded by white settlers. Polish-born Czaplicka trekked 3,000 miles through the Siberian winter to learn the traditions of hunters who spent much of the year in darkness. She observed a culture in flux, changed forever in 1904 by the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Winifred Blackman, from a genteel but impoverished Anglican vicar\u2019s family, spent 19 seasons living with the agricultural peasants of Upper Egypt. Fights between villages were common, and her most reliable guide was murdered. But instead of fleeing from such conflicts, she dodged about, making notes and taking photos. Beatrice Blackwood, the single-minded eldest child of a widow, traveled into the unmapped jungles of New Guinea. She also met, and heartily distrusted, the reigning star of female anthropologists, Margaret Mead.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

", "note_en": "If you\u2019re a graduate interviewing for a software job and wondering what a typical day is like, here\u2019s some notes from what I did last Tuesday. It was a pretty typical day.\n First, as soon as I got to work I realized the night shift had set the linked list up backwards. Doh! I quickly went to the whiteboard to figure out how to reverse it. This won\u2019t be a problem much longer as our team is switching to a double-ended linked list soon. We\u2019re presenting to management about it next week.\n I grabbed the first task from my work queue: One of our customers has a long string, and they need to find whether a smaller string is contained within it. This is our bread-and-butter as software engineers. I quickly coded up a Rabin-Karp search with a rolling hash, and had the answer for them by 10am.\n Coffee, then task two: The QA team rejected the sort implementation I did last week. I\u2019d written a basic Bubble Sort, and QA wanted to beat O(n2) for the average case. No problem, I switched to a Merge Sort and was done by lunchtime.\n That reminded me that I hadn\u2019t finished my Big O calculations for the design review later this week, so that was my first task after lunch. Junior engineers only do the \u2018n\u2019 part, but as a senior I do the constant as well. I have three more functions to calculate.\n Greg, my colleague came over, he needed help balancing his tree. He\u2019s using a Red-Black; those are tricky. After a quick consult with Dave our lead engineer, I helped Greg switch his design to an AVL. He has a lookup-intensive use case, so it\u2019s a better match.\n And that\u2019s it, I headed for the bus station and home. But wait, my day wasn\u2019t over! The bus driver\u2019s watch was broken, and he needed to time 15 minutes. Luckily I had with me two ropes of varying density, both of which burn for exactly one hour\u2026", "posttime": "2021-06-19 23:22:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker

on Friday that facial recognition technology can be harnessed to make our lives more efficient and secure, but said there was a clear danger that it could be misused.\n Live facial recognition (LFR) technology capable of scanning people\u2019s faces in real time as they walk down the street or enter a shop can be used  \u201cinappropriately, excessively or even recklessly,\u201d the head of the UK data watchdog said, noting that there could be \u201csignificant\u201d consequences if sensitive personal data were collected on a mass scale without people even knowing they were being monitored.\n We should be able to take our children to a leisure complex, visit a shopping centre or tour a city to see the sights without having our biometric data collected and analysed with every step we take.\n Denham said that, unlike CCTV, LFR is able to identify individuals in real time and  \u201cinstantly profile you\u201d. While the tech can be used for more benign purposes such as creating customised adverts, it can also lead to greater surveillance.\n She pointed to six ICO investigations into the use, testing and planned deployment of LFR systems in the UK, noting that none of the organisations involved in the probes was able to fully justify why it was using the technology, and none was fully compliant with regulations under current data protection laws. As a result, all of the organisations involved in the investigations paused or halted their use of LFR technology.\n              The proposed LFR systems wanted to use the technology to create customised billboards based on biometric profiles.\n In an opinion issued following the investigations, Denham said that  \u201cthe law sets a high bar to justify the use of LFR\u201d and that  \u201cdata protection and people\u2019s privacy must be at the heart of any decisions\u201d to use the potentially invasive tech.\n The debate over personal privacy rights has become more lively as technology surrounding data collection and processing continues to forge ahead. Last month, the UK government admitted that it used phone data to analyse people\u2019s movement patterns without their knowledge as part of a vaccination study, a new report claims. Officials are said to have preserved the subjects\u2019 anonymity, however.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 22:46:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u76d1\u63a7,monitored", "title": "\u5982\u679c\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u770b\u95e8\u72d7\u8b66\u544a\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65'\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u5206\u6790 ", "title_en": "\u2018Every step we take\u2019 could be monitored and analysed if facial recognition tech isn\u2019t reined in, UK data watchdog warns", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.rt.com/uk/527029-facial-recognition-privacy-ico/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u76d1\u63a7", "monitored"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e704e6d38e1a7077d78c425b3f7cd718.jpeg", "infoid": 1066893, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u82f1\u683c\u5170\uff08AP\uff09\u666e\u5229\u8305\u65af -  50\u591a\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u4e94\u6708\u82b1\u5728\u5176\u5f00\u62d3\u6d77\u4e0a\u822a\u884c\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u3002 \u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u52a9\u529b\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u662f\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6545\u969c\u3002 ", "note_en": "PLYMOUTH, England (AP) \u2014 The Mayflower had a few false starts before its trailblazing sea voyage to America more than 400 years ago.

Google\u2019s tracking system FLoC \u2014 or Federated Learning of Cohorts \u2014 from gathering valuable data reflecting\u00a0the\u00a0products people research\u00a0in Amazon\u2019s vast e-commerce universe, according to website code analyzed\u00a0by Digiday\u00a0and three technology experts who helped Digiday review the code.\n As\u00a0Google\u2019s system gathers data about people\u2019s web travels to inform how it categorizes\u00a0them,\u00a0Amazon\u2019s under-the-radar move\u00a0could\u00a0not only be a significant blow to Google\u2019s mission to guide the future of digital ad tracking after cookies die\u00a0\u2014 it could give Amazon a leg up in its own efforts to sell advertising across what\u2019s left of the open web.\n \u201cThis move is in direct correlation with Google\u2019s attempt to provide an alternative to the third-party cookie,\u201d said\u00a0Amanda Martin, vp of enterprise partnerships at digital agency Goodway Group. She called Amazon\u2019s choice to block FLoC on most of its sites another example of the chess moves Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are making as data privacy pressures force the destruction  of the foundation of data tracking across the internet:\u00a0 the third party cookie.   With the help of three technologists, Digiday watched last week as Amazon added code to its digital properties to block FLoC from tracking visitors using Google\u2019s Chrome browser. For example, while earlier in the week WholeFoods.com and Woot.com did not include code to block FLoC, by Thursday Digiday saw that those sites did feature code telling Google\u2019s system not to include activities of their visitors to inform cohorts or assign IDs. But Amazon\u2019s blocking appears scattered. While one of the technologists saw both of those sites blocking FLoC, another did not, and said Amazon\u2019s deployment could be evident on different servers in different parts of the country.\n There is a caveat regarding FLoC blocking on Whole Foods pages, however. While other Amazon-owned domains mentioned here that block FLoC do so using Google\u2019s recommended approach involving sending a response header from HTML pages, Whole Foods blocking employs a tactic that sends an opt-out header from Amazon analytics requests. One technologist who asked not to be named for this story said the distinction is noteworthy because the approach Amazon has implemented for most sites employs the approach recommended by Google, and therefore \u201cknown to be 100% effective,\u201d according to the technologist, who said the approach used to block FLoC on Whole Foods pages could be an oversight or a deliberate choice on Amazon\u2019s part, possibly as a test of some kind.   Google says FLoC is intended to protect people\u2019s privacy because\u00a0it uses machine learning to group them based on the web pages they have viewed rather than tracking them at the individual level.\u00a0Right now, the system is in a pilot phase, assembling data indicating what websites, content and products people are interested in.   Why Amazon is blocking FLoC\n While it may seem obvious that Amazon would want to throw a wrench in any Google initiative, the company has plenty of reasons for hindering FLoC\u2019s success.\n First, Amazon wants to protect its intellectual property \u2014 the prized data it has that shows what products people research, review and buy online. With an influx of shoppers expected to flood to the site on its Prime Days on June 21 and 22, now is the time to put up an electric fence preventing Google from feeding off that valuable data trough.\u00a0Already, as reported by Digiday last week, ad tech firms and agencies are\u00a0 gathering and analyzing FLoC ID data\u00a0in the hopes of improving targeting and identification capabilities. Put simply, it is not in Amazon\u2019s best interest to let outsiders like Google or other ad tech firms take advantage of its valuable shopper data.\n Without Amazon visitors in the mix, Google\u2019s FLoC could be at a disadvantage, said one agency executive who spoke anonymously with Digiday. Had Amazon chosen not to block FLoC, the company could have assisted Google by enabling \u201csignificantly improved results of certain in-market shopping FLoCs,\u201d said the exec. Already, Google\u2019s claims about the performance of the method have been\u00a0 subject to scrutiny.\n Amazon\u2019s move is a \u201chuge restriction\u201d on Google\u2019s shopper data gathering, said one of the technologists who assisted Digiday in research for this story and asked not to be named.\u00a0\u201cWhat you browse on Amazon is who you are,\u201d said the source, who works with ad tech-related data.\n Plus, blocking FLoC is a competitive decision. Amazon has its own aspirations for grabbing more of the ad dollars Google controls by selling digital ads outside Amazon properties. As Amazon\u2019s demand-side platform business takes off, the firm\u00a0 plans to launch an\u00a0identifier\u00a0for tracking and measuring ads sold through the DSP and by publishers through Amazon\u2019s publisher services division.\u00a0\u201cIt strengthens [Amazon\u2019s] DSP offering to block it,\u201d said the agency exec.\n  \u201cWhy give Google an inch?\u201d asked another Amazon-focused agency executive who also spoke with Digiday on condition of anonymity.\n However, while impeding FLoC from becoming a preferred alternative to third-party cookie tracking could help Amazon, the company loses out on some information that could be of value to it by blocking FLoC. Like other\u00a0 publishers preventing the tracking method, Amazon will not be able to intercept the clues FLoC IDs provide that give a window into people\u2019s behavior. Arguably, that information is of limited value to Amazon considering the trove of logged-in shopper information it has at its disposal.   Why an Amazon site is letting in FLoC\u00a0  Amazon-owned e-commerce sites including WholeFoods, Zappos, ShopBop and GoodReads display code that block FLoC; however, at least at the time of this story\u2019s publication, Amazon-owned bookselling site AbeBooks was not blocking it.\n Amazon could have a motive for enabling Google\u2019s trackers to take note of what content and books AbeBooks visitors look at, the second agency executive speculated. \u201cThey\u00a0don\u2019t just do stuff,\u201d said the exec regarding Amazon\u2019s deliberate approach. \u201cThis has got to be a test of some kind,\u201d said the exec. For instance, while Amazon has lots of data internally about people\u2019s interests related to books, the company could want to learn what FLoC IDs tell it about the interests of AbeBooks visitors outside the site, they added.\n Amazon might also want to see how its own ad tracking and targeting stacks up against Google\u2019s in a control test of some sort.\u00a0\u201cYou could then put\u00a0Google in\u00a0their\u00a0own horse race without telling them,\u201d said the exec.\n But, Amazon might be planning to stop FLoC tracking on AbeBooks, too, according to ad tech researcher\u00a0Krzysztof Franaszek,\u00a0who has\u00a0 conducted FLoC research\u00a0and helped verify Amazon\u2019s FLoC blocking for this story.

The complaints reached another crescendo this week after Axios  published a \u201cdeep dive\u201d article about the threat of unemployment fraud based on statistics provided to the outlet by ID.me.\n    Some unemployment applicants have said that ID.me\u2019s facial recognition models fail to properly identify them (generally speaking, facial recognition technology is notoriously less accurate for women and people of color). And after their applications were put on hold because their identity couldn\u2019t be verified, many should-be beneficiaries have had to wait days or weeks to reach an ID.me \u201ctrusted referee\u201d who could confirm what the technology couldn\u2019t.\n  On Twitter, there are dozens of complaints about ID.me per day, and local news articles all over the country have detailed the problem over the course of months. In California, 1.4 million unemployment beneficiary accounts were abruptly suspended on New Year\u2019s Eve and the beneficiaries were required to re-verify their identity using ID.me, a process which  many found difficult and resulted in them waiting for weeks to reactivate their accounts while they struggled to make ends meet.\n   In Colorado, benefit recipients who had no problem establishing their identity before ID.me took over  were suddenly rejected and went months without receiving the payments they were eligible for.\n      ID.me CEO Blake Hall told Motherboard that the company\u2019s facial recognition technology does one-to-one matching\u2014comparing one face against a picture of that same face (from a driver\u2019s license, say)\u2014whereas other applications of facial recognition attempt to find a match for a face in a large dataset of faces, known as one-to-many matching.\n  \u201cThe algorithms used for Face Match operate ~99.9% efficacy,\u201d Hall wrote in an email to Motherboard. \u201cThere is in fact no relationship between skin tone and Face Match failure on a 1:1 basis\u201d according to a regression analysis the company performed.\n  That doesn\u2019t mesh with the  experiences being shared on Twitter by people like Tim Weaver, a gig economy worker in Las Vegas who was suddenly cut off from his unemployment benefits in late March after ID.me failed to identify him.\n  Weaver told Motherboard that when he attempted to pass ID.me\u2019s facial recognition test he held a phone in front of him in the instructed position but \u201cit rejected it, didn\u2019t give us a reason, just rejected it. It rejected it three times, and then it locked me out of the system.\u201d\n  Weaver said he attempted to contact the company\u2019s customer support through its chat feature, which claims to provide assistance 24-hours a day, seven days a week. He tried numerous times at all hours of the day. He tried contacting the state of Nevada for help, but the employees there directed him back to ID.me.\n    This went on for several weeks, Weaver said, until he tweeted a  scathing criticism of the company, which then reached out and\u2014after several more frustrating days\u2014verified Weaver\u2019s identity.\n  Weaver went for three weeks without receiving his benefit. \u201cI couldn\u2019t pay bills,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily I had enough food saved up so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that. It\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n  In his statement to Motherboard, Hall said that facial recognition failures are not a problem with the technology but with the people using it to verify their identity. \u201cFor example, if someone uploads a selfie that only shows half their face.\u201d\n  \u201cWe are unaware of eligible individuals who have not been able to verify their identity with ID.me,\u201d he said, and \u201cthe wait time for a live video chat session right now is less than five minutes and it has been consistently under 30 minutes all week.\u201d\n  A quick search for  tweets directed at ID.me shows reams of people locked out of their unemployment accounts by the company.\n  At least  21 states use ID.me to detect fraudulent benefit claims. The spread of the technology has coincided with an aggressive media blitz from Hall in which he has stoked fears about the crisis of unemployment fraud using some fluid statistics.\n    In February, he told an  Oregon TV station that unemployment fraud had cost the country $100 billion. Several weeks later, he told a Montana TV station that unemployment fraud had  cost the country nearly $200 billion. The next month, he was telling a  San Diego station that unemployment fraud would cost $300 billion. By the time ID.me reached Axios, it was $400 billion.\n  Hall told Motherboard that the Oregon TV station didn\u2019t quote him directly\u2014it did attribute the $100 billion estimate to him, though\u2014and that he was consistent through January and February estimating the losses from unemployment fraud around $200 billion. \u201cAs we screened existing claimants in more states, we had more data points \u2026 In June, I estimated the loss over $400 [billion] in line with past estimates. All of those data points are consistent over time.\u201d\n  Hall did not respond to Motherboard\u2019s question about how ID.me calculated its estimates.\n    It\u2019s possible that the rate of successful unemployment fraud is growing rapidly\u2014hence Hall\u2019s rising cost estimates\u2014but ID.me also has a vested interest in depicting fraud as a major problem, which Hall has repeatedly done. It makes sense for a company that makes anti-fraud technology to study fraud; it&#39;s also fair for the general public to be skeptical of fraud statistics published by companies that would benefit from showing that fraud is a major problem.\n  Axios has now published two articles that have cited the company&#39;s numbers, and, on Twitter, Axios writer Felix Salmon suggested that fraud associated with expanded unemployment insurance during the pandemic has resulted in &#34; quite possibly the largest theft of all time.&#34;\n  The Axios article has been widely criticized for using ID.me\u2014a company with a financial incentive to inflate the rate of unemployment fraud\u2014as its main source. And while many local news outlets have provided great coverage of the pain caused by delays due to ID.me\u2019s system, others have run with stories similar to Axios\u2019s, citing the company\u2019s numbers. The Axios article was also immediately cited by  Republicans in the House of Representatives as evidence of widespread defrauding of the U.S. government.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor says that between March and October 2020 it  uncovered just $5.6 billion in potentially fraudulent unemployment payments. And while more recent data suggests the losses are actually higher, the agency estimated that they would be \u201cinto the tens of billions of dollars.\u201d\n  Weaver said he thinks it\u2019s very important to prevent fraudulent claims, but he\u2019s mad at ID.me and even madder at Nevada for wthe current identity verification system and how it was implemented on such short notice.",

", "note_en": "We are making changes to our published rates in the United States to better align our pricing with the value that our products and services provide. Our goal is to be transparent and upfront with our customers about the changes. These rates will apply to a portion of our merchant customers in the U.S. beginning August 2, 2021. We began notifying some customers today, and you can find a notice on our  Policy Updates page.\n  PayPal Digital Payments: For PayPal payment products (such as PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit, Pay in 4, PayPal Pay with Rewards, Checkout with crypto), which include Seller Protection on eligible transactions, the rate for online transactions will be  3.49% + $0.49 1\u00a0per transaction.\n  In-person Payments: For PayPal and Venmo QR code transactions over $10, the rate will be  1.90% + $0.10, and for such transactions $10 and under, the rate will be  2.40% + $0.05. For certain in-person debit and credit transactions the rate will be  2.29% + $0.09.\n  Credit and Debit Card payments: \u00a0Online credit and debit card transactions will be  2.59% + $0.49 1\u00a0per transaction without Chargeback Protection, or  2.99% + $0.49 with Chargeback Protection.\n  Charity Transactions: Fees for charity transactions will be  1.99% + $0.49 for confirmed charities (subject to application and pre-approval).\n  Non-standard Pricing: For U.S. merchants who have custom, non-standard pricing, rates will remain unchanged for those services as agreed.\n          As PayPal has been evolving our business alongside our merchant business partners, we have accelerated the rollout of products, features, and capabilities, delivering more benefits than ever before. With this, PayPal has become more than just a button or payment processor to be a full commerce platform capable of driving growth for businesses of all sizes online or in person. In fact, our merchant customers benefit from the following:\n  Consumers who choose PayPal as a payment method are  60% more likely to convert than consumers who do not choose PayPal as a payment method.  2\n  Consumers are  nearly three times more likely to complete their purchase when PayPal is available at checkout. 3\n  Our recently announced Buy Now, Pay Later solutions have resulted in a  15% lift in payment volume for businesses. 4\n  Additionally, we are continuing to partner and invest in our platforms to enhance payment experiences, provide greater choice for the way people pay for goods and services, improve protection and security measures to give people peace of mind when transacting digitally, and improve authorization and conversion rates.\n  We are continuing to innovate at record pace and empower businesses to never miss a transaction no matter where they do business. By investing in our data analytics capabilities, the improvement of our fraud tools, and the new consumer experiences we are delivering with products like Buy Now and Pay Later, Pay with Rewards Points, and Checkout with crypto \u2013 we remain at the cutting edge of payments.\n  See how our adjusted pricing in the U.S. stacks up to others in the industry, and you can learn more at this  SMB pricing page:\n          Our commitment to our partners \u2013 businesses that are the lifeblood of our communities and economy - has never been stronger. We will continue to invest, innovate, and provide businesses with the tools and experiences they need to grow, convert, and retain customers.\n  For more information about these changes, please visit our  PayPal Merchant Fees page and our  pricing FAQ.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 22:38:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4f01\u4e1a,upcoming,\u652f\u4ed8", "title": "\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u53d8\u5316 ", "title_en": "Upcoming Changes for Some US Businesses", "transed": 1, "url": "https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-18-Upcoming-Changes-for-Some-US-Businesses", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u4f01\u4e1a", "upcoming", "\u652f\u4ed8"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0b7f10476c1ff9f38b7786e8867b93d8.jpg", "infoid": 1066889, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "LiveBook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aWeb\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u5199\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u7801Notebooks.https\uff1a//github.com/elixir-nx/livebook/see elixirconf.com\u4e3aLates ...
