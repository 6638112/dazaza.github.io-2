The video games world is not getting any younger, and the most famous creators of yesterday are now well past 60.  Sid Meier is no exception. I picked up  his memoir and it was a good read. I am now pretty confident that we will see more publications in the same vein, as the age of pioneers reaches an end.</p><p>面对现实吧。视频游戏世界没有获得更年轻，而且昨天最着名的创造者现在已经好过了60岁。Sid Meier也不例外。我拿起了他的回忆录，这是一个很好的阅读。我现在非常有信心我们将在同一个静脉中看到更多的出版物，因为先锋的年龄达到了一端。</p><p> For Linux gamers, Sid Meier’s current company,  Firaxis, is a well known benefactor – one of the few friendly to our cause: Civilization 5, 6, and Beyond Earth have all been ported to Linux by Aspyr with the blessing of Firaxis. Even back in the  Loki days,  Civilization: Call To Power was one of the first games ported to Linux… while this was not a game by Sid Meier – just one from  Activision who had secured the rights to the franchise. This is one of the things you will learn as you go through this memoir.</p><p> 对于Linux游戏玩家，Sid Meier的现任公司火箭衫是一个着名的恩赐，是我们其事业的少数友好之一：文明5，6，以外的地球都被阿斯特拉斯与火花的祝福移植到Linux。甚至回到Loki天，文明：呼唤权力是第一个移植到Linux的游戏之一......虽然这不是Sid Meier的游戏 - 只有一个来自Spection担保了特许经营权的活动。这是您通过此备忘录时将学习的事情之一。</p><p>  Sid Meier is most well known for his massively successful  Civilization series. But as a young gamer, I experienced many of his other games as I was growing up. This memoir is a timely throw-back into my childhood experiences. Opening up the book for the first time, I was not sure what I was going to find: development stories akin to the ones found in  Masters of Doom? Or something else entirely?</p><p>  Sid Meier是他大规模成功的文明系列最着名的。但作为一个年轻的游戏玩家，我遇到了许多他的其他游戏，因为我在成长时。这个备忘录是及时扔回童年的经历。首次开放书籍，我不确定我要找到的内容：开发故事类似于厄运大师的硕士？还是完全别的东西？</p><p> Actually, this reads like a personal journey with self-reflection. What brought Sid Meier to gaming, how he grew up, how he ended up becoming a game designer and what drove him to go from one title to the next. Don’t expect any deep insight on how every title was conceived and developed. Most of the time, there are only superficial allusions about the creative process or the choices he made along with his team members. Sometimes Sid Meier makes the case for some specific principles on how to make games more fun, but a detailed game designer manual this is not.</p><p> 实际上，这读得像个人旅程一样，自我反思。是什么让梅尔赌博的游戏，他如何长大，他如何最终成为一名游戏设计师，以及驱动他从一个标题到下一个标题。不要期望对每个标题的构思和发展方式有任何深刻的洞察力。大多数时候，只有关于创造性的过程或他与他的团队成员一起做出的选择的肤浅的暗示。有时SID Meier会使这种情况有关如何使游戏更有趣的一些特定原则，但是一个详细的游戏设计师手册这不是。</p><p> Sid Meier has Swiss heritage and while he was born and raised in Canada, he traveled and stayed in Switzerland several times for vacation and sometimes for extended periods. There were some times he was very close to living there, both as a child and as an adult. But the constraint of military obligations (mandatory for Swiss citizens) provided him with a good excuse to return to the US in order to skip it. Imagine an alternative universe where Sid Meier stayed in Switzerland, ended up not making games and may have become someone else entirely with a more quiet destiny in the middle of Europe. Sometimes destiny works in mysterious ways.</p><p> Sid Meier有瑞士遗产，而他在加拿大出生并在加拿大养成，他在瑞士旅行并在瑞士留在瑞士度假，有时延长了。有时候他非常接近在那里生活，无论是孩子还是作为成年人。但军事义务的制约（瑞士公民的强制性）为他提供了借口返回美国以跳过它。想象一下一个替代宇宙，梅尔住在瑞士，最终没有制作游戏，可能已经成为欧洲中部更安静的命运。有时命运以神秘的方式工作。</p><p> Sid ended up meeting and befriending  Bill Stealey, and together they co-founded  Microprose. Bill was a veteran pilot and thought that it was possible to do better games with planes than the ones available at the time. Sid said he could technically do it – and taking up the challenge led to incorporating a company.</p><p> SID结束了会议和与Bill Stealey合作，他们共同创立了米抚养。比尔是一名退伍军人飞行员，并认为有可能比当时可用的飞机做得更好。 SID说，他可以在技术上做到 - 并占据挑战导致融合公司。</p><p>  This explains why a lot of early Microprose games had a focus on flight simulations, and then simulations in more general terms. Sid ended up programming several flight simulators under the pressure (and interest) of Bill, but got sick of it after a while, and went on to explore other genres. One of the was  Covert Action. A FBI-CIA-esque title focused on investigations, including also some kind of mini-games and procedural generation of detective stories. Mixing two games into one proved perillous: the mini-games were fun, and the generated stories too, but the whole fell apart when combined. Sid felt it did not work very well, no matter how many times he tried to tweak it. Even later on, he kept pursuing the idea of making procedurally generated detective stories that could be worth playing – an elusive goal. Small trivia:  Covert Action became their first title ported to Linux, well before any porting company existed.</p><p>  这解释了为什么许多早期的微升压游戏都侧重于飞行模拟，然后以更一般的方式模拟。 SID结束了编程在票据的压力（和兴趣）下编程了几个飞行模拟器，但经过一段时间又厌倦了它，并继续探索其他类型。其中一个是隐蔽的行动。 FBI-CIA-ESQUESQUESQUESQUESICE关于调查，包括某种迷你游戏和程序生成的侦探故事。将两场比赛混合到一个被证明的危险：迷你游戏很有趣，而且产生的故事也很有趣，但整个整体混合在结合时崩溃了。无论他多次试图调整它，SID都觉得它没有很好地工作。甚至后来，他仍然追求制作程序产生的侦探故事的想法 - 这是一个难以捉摸的目标。小型琐事：隐蔽行动成为他们的第一个销量移植到Linux，并且在任何移植公司存在之前。 </p><p> Railroad Tycoon started as an experiment that connected his love of games and of miniature trains. In the beginning it was mostly about creating train tracks until it turned into a full-fledged economical simulation involving trains.</p><p>铁路大亨开始作为一种实验，这些实验将他对游戏和微型火车的热爱。在开始，它主要是为了创建火车轨道，直到它变成了涉及火车的全面经济模拟。</p><p>  Civilization started as a weekend side project, and ended up the way we know it through numerous iterations following the feedback of  Bruce Shelley, who was a board game designer at  Avalon Hill before joining the industry.  Civilization was initially not supported in any way by Microprose. The board did not believe in it (despite the trail of successful projects by Sid before) but they anyway let Sid publish it out of respect. Little did they know it would become the massive franchise that we all know about now. An eternal reminder that predicting what will sell well is an impossible task. But Sid saw early signs of what Civilization could become as his co-workers fell into the  just one more turn trap and ended staying in front of the game for hours and hours. Something this addictive is bound to make waves.</p><p>  文明开始作为一个周末的项目，并通过众多迭代在布鲁斯·谢尔利的反馈之后，在加入行业之前是阿瓦隆山的董事会游戏设计师，以众多迭代结束。文明最初不以任何方式通过微升压支持。董事会没有相信它（尽管以前的SID成功的项目跟踪），但他们无论如何让SID出于尊重。他们很少知道它将成为我们现在都知道的大规模特许经营权。一个永恒的提醒，预测卖得良好的东西是一个不可能的任务。但是SID看到了文明的早期迹象可能成为他的同事进入刚刚进入陷阱，并结束留在游戏前几个小时。这个上瘾的东西必然会产生波浪。</p><p> I guess many of you have already come across this story: how the statistical odds in battles within  Civilization make no sense in terms of probabilities. When you have a 33% chance of winning a fight, it’s entirely possible (and somewhat likely) that you could lose three times in a row. But this was somewhat unintuitive for gamers, and Sid tweaked this to make it so that players would eventually win once every three tries with such odds. It was always the priority to keep the game fun before all kinds of correctness.</p><p> 我猜你们中的许多人已经遇到过这个故事：文明内部战斗中的统计赔率如何在概率方面没有意义。当你有33％的机会赢得战斗时，它完全可能（有点可能）你可以连续三次失去。但是，游戏玩家对此有点不可思议，并且SID调整了这一点，使得玩家最终会赢得一次，每三个都会尝试这种赔率。在各种正确性之前保持游戏乐趣总是优先考虑。</p><p> Following  Civilization, another very successful title was   Colonization. I was really surprised to hear that it was  not a game from Sid Meier, despite what was written on the box. It was entirely made by  Brian Reynolds, and from there on the  Sid Meier’s brand was used as a promotional tool and did not indicate a first hand from Sid in the actual development. While I was never a big fan of Civilization, Colonization is one of the games I have a huge respect for: no tech-tree nonsense, a narrower yet deeper scope on a specific period of history, and a great mix between managing resources and raising an army to declare independence. Brian went on to direct  Civilization II afterwards (and much later, went on to create his own company to make   Rise of Nations).</p><p> 在文明之后，另一个非常成功的头衔是殖民化。我真的很惊讶地听到它不是来自梅尔的比赛，尽管在盒子上写了什么。它完全由Brian Reynolds制作，并且从SID Meier的品牌上被用作促销工具，并没有表明在实际发展中的SID中的第一手。虽然我从来没有一个文明的忠实粉丝，但殖民化是我对我巨大尊重的游戏之一：没有技术树废话，一个更窄的历史时期的范围，以及管理资源和提升之间的巨大组合宣布独立的军队。布莱恩之后继续直接文明II（以后，继续创建自己的公司来提高国家）。</p><p>  Despite the success of the more brainy games, the co-founder of Microprose, Bill Stealey, believed the company should instead go into arcade games – in a time when arcade games were clearly losing momentum. Younger readers have no idea what I am talking about. Well, there was a time, roughly until the early 90s, where people would put money into big machines in large venues to play some of latest games. I remember seeing  Street Fighter II for the first time in one of those. But as game consoles evolved and progressed in capabilities, the excitement of arcades decreased sharply. Now Japan is probably one of the last countries where arcade games remain somewhat popular, but even over here  many of them have closed doors recently.</p><p>  尽管众多智慧游戏的成功，但米尔·斯泰德利的媒介们联合创始人认为，该公司应该在街机游戏显然失去动力的时候进入街机游戏。年轻的读者不知道我在说什么。好吧，有一段时间，大致直到90年代初，人们会把钱放入大型场地的大机器中发挥一些最新游戏。我记得看到街头霸王II在其中一个。但随着游戏机演变和进展的能力，拱廊的兴奋急剧下降。现在，日本可能是最后一个国家之一，街机游戏保持有点流行，但即使在这里，他们中的许多人最近也有闭门。</p><p> Back to Microprose. Betting on arcades at a time when that market was shrinking hard was certainly not the brightest business move by Bill Stealy. It ended up tanking the company completely in a matter of years.   Spectrum Holobyte (famous for publishing  Falcon, among other things), based in California, bought Microprose afterwards, and renamed itself to Microprose for brand recognition. However, the heads of Spectrum Holobyte were more interested in developing titles based on famous IPs rather than developing their own. Hence they made Microprose work on a  Magic The Gathering digital adaptation (but Sid Meier took no part in it).</p><p> 回到镜头。当市场萎缩的时候，投注街机难以肯定不是票据最明亮的业务。它在几年内完全坦克这家公司。 Spectrum Holobyte（以其他方式出版猎鹰），基于加利福尼亚州，然后之后购买了微升压，并将自己重命名为品牌认可。然而，谱Holobyte的首脑对基于着名IPS的发展标题更感兴趣，而不是开发自己。因此，他们对聚集数字适应的魔法进行了微升压（但是SID Meier没有参与其中）。</p><p> Sid was really interested at some point in music theory and how harmonies follow mathematical patterns. This led him to create   CPU Bach, a program that can litteraly compose Bach-like pieces of music out of the blue. It was made for the  3DO console. Why the 3DO? In that very small window of time between the 16 bits consoles and the 32 bits consoles like the Playstation, that was the best hardware available you could make music on. Sadly, CPU Bach failed to leave its mark, as the console itself ended up as a massive market failure (it was launched before the Sony Playstation and quickly faded once Sony took a hold on the gaming market).</p><p> SID对音乐理论的某些观点以及和谐遵循数学模式的意义非常感兴趣。这使他能够创建CPU Bach，这是一个可以将Bach-般的音乐块拼写出来的程序。它是为3DO控制台制作的。为什么3DO？在16位控制台和像PlayStation等32位控制台之间的非常小的时间窗口中，这是您可以拍摄音乐的最佳硬件。可悲的是，CPU Bach未能留下它的标记，因为控制台本身以大规模的市场失败结束（在索尼Playstation之前推出并迅速消退，曾经索尼抓住游戏市场）。 </p><p>  Jeff Briggs, Brian Reynolds and Sid ended up leaving Microprose to form Firaxis ( Fiery Axis) in 1996. Between Firaxis and Microprose there were a lot of touchy IP-related topics, but somehow they managed to navigate through them without resorting to suing each other to death. Bruce Shelley, another ex-Microprose employee who worked extensively on Civilization with Sid, ended up forming  Ensemble Studios and went on to create its own blockbuster franchise,  Ages of Empire. You  may have heard of it! *wink*</p><p>杰夫布里格斯，Brian Reynolds和Sid结束了1996年留下米苏斯（Fiery Axis）。火毛和射击之间有很多无聊的知识产权相关主题，但不知何故，他们设法驾驭他们而不诉诸彼此死亡。 Bruce Shelley，另一位前媒介员工与SID共同努力，最终形成了合奏工作室，并继续创造自己的大片特许经营权，帝国年龄段。你可能听说过它！ *眨眼*</p><p> There were several trials to make  Civilization work online, but they failed badly because they did not design the game too well for network communication from the ground up: too much data to transfer, for too slow networks at the time. There was even the strange  Civ World, a  Civilization version released for Facebook: another failure as players did not react well to the incentives laid out in this version of the game. They had to shut it down within 2 years.</p><p> 有几种试验在线进行文明工作，但他们失败了，因为他们没有设计游戏，对于从地下网络通信的网络通信很好：运输过多的数据，当时太慢的网络。甚至有一个陌生的文明世界，一个为Facebook发布的文明版：另一个失败，因为玩家对游戏中的这个版本所下的激励措施没有做好反应。他们必须在2年内关闭它。</p><p> There’s of course a lot more than the above anecdotes in the book. While I would have liked to better understand the game design choices made in  Civilization (about  what I consider to be an utterly broken tech tree that makes no sense), or why  Beyond Earth was such a poor follow-up, I did find a pleasant read from start to end.</p><p> 当然还有很多比书中上述轶事更多。虽然我要更好地了解文明的游戏设计选择（关于我认为是一个无意义的完全破碎的科技树），或者为什么地球上的为什么这么糟糕的后续行动，我确实找到了一个令人愉快的从开始到结束阅读。</p><p> He does finish with good advice, asking designers to keep iterating quickly on ideas, and test them to see if they work or not… and drop them if they don’t:  don’t get attached to a bad idea. Try it out, see if it works, trash it if it does not. No need to overthink it.</p><p> 他确实完成了良好的建议，要求设计师在想法上快速迭代，并测试它们以查看它们是否工作，如果他们没有：如果他们没有：不要附加到一个坏主意。尝试一下，看看它是否有效，如果没有，请垃圾。不需要过度思考它。</p><p> As for me, my favorite title actually developed by Sid Meier is probably   Pirates!: probably one of the true open-world games because we even coined the term, with numerous quests you could decide to follow in the Caribbean, and countless choices you could take along the way. Completely non-linear from start to finish, with unlimited replayability. A true gem.</p><p> 至于我，我最喜欢的标题是SID Meier的可能是海盗！：可能是真正的开放世界游戏之一，因为我们甚至创造了这个词，有许多任务可以决定在加勒比地区追随，你可以走路。从开始完成完全非线性，无限制地重放。真正的宝石。</p><p>  So… what’s next for Sid Meier? He is not officially retired, so he may still have some ambitious projects under wraps… hopefully not just another  Civ title! But even if he decided to stop now, there would no shame in it: he has been one of the most prolific game designers of the past 40 years, and left a huge collection of games to play… and replay.</p><p>  所以......下一个骗子是什么？他不是正式退休，所以他可能仍然有一些雄心勃勃的项目在包装之下......希望不仅仅是另一个文明冠军！但即使他现在决定停止，它也不会羞辱：他是过去40年来最多的游戏设计师之一，并留下了一系列巨大的游戏来玩...并重播。</p><p>   BoilingSteam lets you access our content for free, but writing articles is a constant investment.
