regulatory and governmental approvals, in a press release post-publication. It also confirmed that the price of the acquisition which will be an $800 million all-cash deal.\n The deal gives 2U,  a company that filed to go public in 2014 and continues to be one of the rare U.S. edtech companies listed on the stock market, a new wave of collaboratively-built content to its software. Plus, 2U just acquired with stronger name recognition thanks to its Ivy League backers, which some see as a branding move that could help the public company with its own chunk of the market. The company\u2019s last big acquisition was in 2019,  when it paid $750 million to acquire Trilogy education, a company that builds in-person and online bootcamps in collaboration with universities.\n  EdX was founded in 2012 amid a crop of massive open online course (MOOC) offerings, including Udacity and Coursera. The company, set up as a non-profit, had an alluring promise upon launch: it would help anyone in the world take a Harvard or MIT class, for free. The institutions, of course, have thrown in a cumulative $80 million in donations into edX to keep the operation free.  Its own launch came weeks after Coursera announced that Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, and the University of Michigan would host courses on its own online learning platform. Now, edX\u2019s acquisition comes months after Coursera went public.\n  Today, edX, led by president and professor Anant Agarwal, hosts over 3,000 courses led by 15,000 instructors and used by 35 million users. Open edX, the platform\u2019s open source platform, is used by 2,400 learning sites worldwide,  according to the organization\u2019s website.\n EdX will turn into a public benefit corporation as part of this transaction. Per sources, proceeds from the transaction will go into another non-profit managed by Harvard and MIT, and the institutions will not profit off of the transaction. That said, an MIT statement reveals. that edX took a line of credit from MIT and Harvard, and those funds will be returned to both institutions.\n \u201cBecause edX is a public charity, the proceeds from its sale can only be distributed for a purpose consistent with edX\u2019s mission, not to compensate those who contributed to the nonprofit,\u201d  the statement reads.\n Part of this transaction, which has been in the works since February 2021, is colored by the fact that edX has been transparent with its own financial woes and journey to becoming a self-sustaining business. Then MIT Provost Rafael Reif, now the president of the school, had  hinted at eventual revenue generation the program first launched, saying in 2012 that \u201cthe drive is not to make money..that said, we intend to find a way to support those activities. There are several approaches we are considering, and we don\u2019t want this project to become a drain on the budgets of MIT or Harvard.\u201d\n In 2018, the same fiscal year it  had $37 million in revenue, edX introduced  a support fee, alongside its ongoing offering that asks students to pay for a verified certification upon course completion. In announcement, the company wrote that \u201cwe believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.\u201d The edX board also considered other options, MIT. said,  but decided those were \u201cnot as beneficial to edX, its learners, or its partner institutions as the transaction with 2U.\u201d\n The new transaction and edX\u2019s choice to turn into a public benefit corporation might become the financial model that it itself was looking for, indicating just how. hard it may be to monetize a MOOC. While 2U has committed to continuing edX\u2019s free coursework for at least five years, as well as seeding a new non-profit, edX as it currently stands \u2013 a massive education non-profit \u2013 will no longer function as it currently does in the future.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

\uff08song@heraldcorp.com\uff09 ", "note_en": "A Seoul court\u2019s decision last week that effectively confirmed Netflix\u2018s obligation to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers suggests that the global video streaming giant might have to change its business strategy in South Korea, according to industry sources Monday.   The US-based content provider that raised 415.5 billion won ($367.6 million) in revenue in Korea alone last year has not been paying network fees to provider SK Broadband, the internet protocol TV subsidiary of SK Telecom.   The SK unit filed a complaint with the Korea Communications Commission in November 2019, and Netflix sued SK a few months later. Netflix asked the court to review whether or not it has an obligation to pay for its network usage.   On Friday, the court ruled against Netflix, saying, \u201cAccording to the principle of freedom of contract, whether to conclude a contract and what price to pay is a matter to be decided through the negotiations of the concerned parties.\u201d\u00a0  The court also said, \u201cNetflix is at least receiving network services, including management of the network quality, at a cost.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cIt is also reasonable to say that Netflix has the obligation of paying the price for the services to SK Broadband.\u201d  Friday\u2018s ruling was interpreted by industry watchers as indicating the principle of net neutrality is losing ground in Korea, where global platform giants, including Facebook and Google, would be obligated to pay the price for their massive network traffic as they see growing numbers of Korean subscribers.   \u201cThis decision clearly confirms by law that Netflix needs to pay network usage fees to SK Broadband,\u201d the internet service provider said.   It seems highly likely that Netflix will appeal, although the US firm officially said it will continue its partnership with SK Broadband for both companies\u2019 customers and promised to continue investing in its \u201copen connect\u201d strategy.   The US firm has forged marketing partnerships with KT and LG U+, giving it an upper hand on the fee issue with the two other mobile carriers.\u00a0  \u00a0On Monday, SKT CEO Park Jung-ho commented on the issue, saying, \u201cThe time has come to meet Netflix.\u201d  \u201cI think the ruling can make our meeting much better. Cooperation in Asia will be important for Netflix.\u201d   According to industry estimates, the total fees Netflix will have to pay to all three mobile carriers would be over 100 billion won a year.   Netflix accounted for 4.8 percent of the country\u2019s total network traffic in the fourth quarter of 2020.   Korean portal giant Naver, which accounted for 1.8 percent of all traffic, paid around 70 billion won last year. Kakao paid around 30 billion won   The court estimated the network usage fee for SK would be around 200 billion won.   \u201cIf Netflix changes its stance and is willing to talk with us, both firms could appraise the exact amount of fees,\u201d an official from SK Broadband said. \u201cHowever, an appeal is highly likely to follow.\u201d   Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic affected Korea, the number of Netflix users grew and network traffic spiked due to the streaming service, the SK official explained.   Since the Korean telecommunications network is part of the national backbone, when network speeds slow down, mobile carriers are forced to deal with poor network quality.   Also, unlike in the United States where the net neutrality principle was abandoned, Korea keeps the principle that stipulates internet service providers should treat all data on the internet the same, and not discriminate against content providers.   Netflix, which pays usage fees in the US, Japan and France, insists on net neutrality in Korea.   \u201cThe latest ruling might give KT and LG U+ room for negotiating the fee,\u201d said an industry official. \u201cIt would also affect entries and business strategies of other foreign content providers like Disney+ and Amazon Prime that are eyeing the Korean market.\u201d\u00a0  ( song@heraldcorp.com)", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f51\u7edc,traffic,netflix", "title": "\u97e9\u56fd\u6cd5\u9662\u88c1\u5b9aNetflix\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u4f7f\u7528\u8d39; Netflix\u57282020\u5e74\u7b2c\u56db\u5b63\u5ea6\u5360\u8be5\u56fd\u4ea4\u901a\u76844.8\uff05 ", "title_en": "A South Korean court has ruled that Netflix is obligated to pay network usage fees to mobile carriers; Netflix made up 4.8% of the country's traffic in Q4 2020", "transed": 1, "url": "http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210628000798", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f51\u7edc", "traffic", "netflix"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cd79ea6516cd435bdfe215883d9a5383.jpg", "infoid": 1068552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Snapchat\u662f\u8b66\u544aiPhone\u7528\u6237\uff0cApp Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7248\u672c\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\n  Snapchat\u4e0a\u6b21\u57286\u670828\u65e5\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86IOS\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u7248\u672c11.34.0.35\u66f4\u65b0\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u6d88\u606f\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u53d1\u5e03\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u51fa\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n \u8bb8\u591aSnapchat\u7528\u6237\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6253\u5f00\u5b83\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u5d29\u6e83\u5230iPhone\u4e3b\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u89e6\u53d1\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u6599\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89c1\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\n  Snapchat\uff06\uff0339; S\u652f\u6301\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u5230Twitter\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8b66\u544a\u7528\u6237\uff06\uff0334;\u6302\u7d27\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u5e76\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff01\uff06\uff0334;\n \u867d\u7136\u5b83\u662f\u672a\u77e5\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728App Store\u4e2d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7App Store Review\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u67e5\u672c\u8eab\u5feb\u901f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7248\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5feb\u5230\u8fbe\u3002\n \u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4e0b\u53487:23\u3002\u4e1c\u90e8\uff1aSnapchat\u62a5\u544a\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u7ee7\u7eed\u770b\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7528\u6237\u88ab\u6307\u793a\u624b\u52a8\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u7248\u672c11.34.1.35\u3002\n \u5728\u6bcf\u5468AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4e2d\u8ddf\u4e0aApple  - \u5e76\u6bcf\u5929\u4eceAppleInsider\u83b7\u5f97\u5feb\u901f\u65b0\u95fb\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u521a\u8bf4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u563f\uff0c\u897f\u91cc\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u60a8\u7684HomePod Mini\u5e76\u8be2\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u65b0\u7684HomeKit Insider Enisode\u3002 \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u4e3b\u8981AppleInsider\u64ad\u5ba2\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u82f9\u679c\uff06\uff0339; s vodcasts\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba2\u96055\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7Patreon\u6765\u652f\u6301AppleInsider Podcast\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u559c\u6b22\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u64ad\u5ba2\u64ad\u653e\u5668\u3002  AppleInsider\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4ea4\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u57f9\u8bad\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002 \u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 ", "note_en": "Snapchat is warning iPhone users that the version of the messaging app available in the  App Store has a problem, and is something the company is trying to solve.\n  Snapchat last updated its  iOS app in the App Store on  June 28, with the version 11.34.0.35 update adding a number of &#34;bug fixes&#34; to the messaging tool.

If so, the updated version could arrive fairly soon.\n Update, 7:23 p.m. Eastern: Snapchat reports the issue has  been fixed.

The report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health, is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of international experts appointed by WHO. \u201cLike all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cThis important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.\u201d Artificial intelligence can be, and in some wealthy countries is already being used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and screening for diseases; to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management. AI could also empower patients to take greater control of their own health care and better understand their evolving needs. It could also enable resource-poor countries and rural communities, where patients often have restricted access to health-care workers or medical professionals, to bridge gaps in access to health services.However, WHO\u2019s new report cautions against overestimating the benefits of AI for health, especially when this occurs at the expense of core investments and strategies required to achieve universal health coverage.It also points out that opportunities are linked to challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data; biases encoded in algorithms, and risks of AI to patient safety, cybersecurity, and the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example, while private and public sector investment in the development and deployment of AI is critical, the unregulated use of AI could subordinate the rights and interests of patients and communities to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control. The report also emphasizes that systems trained primarily on data collected from individuals in high-income countries may not perform well for individuals in low- and middle-income settings. AI systems should therefore be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socio-economic and health-care settings. They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients. Ultimately, guided by existing laws and human rights obligations, and new laws and policies that enshrine ethical principles, governments, providers, and designers must work together to address ethics and human rights concerns at every stage of an AI technology\u2019s design, development, and deployment.\u00a0\u00a0Six principles to ensure AI works for the public interest in all countriesTo limit the risks and maximize the opportunities intrinsic to the use of AI for health, WHO provides the following principles as the basis for AI regulation and governance:Protecting human autonomy: In the context of health care, this means that humans should remain in control of health-care systems and medical decisions; privacy and confidentiality should be protected, and patients must give valid informed consent through appropriate legal frameworks for data protection.Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest. The designers of AI technologies should satisfy regulatory requirements for safety, accuracy and efficacy for well-defined use cases or indications. Measures of quality control in practice and quality improvement in the use of AI must be available. Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility. Transparency requires that sufficient information be published or documented before the design or deployment of an AI technology. Such information must be easily accessible and facilitate meaningful public consultation and debate on how the technology is designed and how it should or should not be used. Fostering responsibility and accountability. Although AI technologies perform specific tasks, it is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that they are used under appropriate conditions and by appropriately trained people. Effective mechanisms should be available for questioning and for redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by decisions based on algorithms.Ensuring inclusiveness and equity. Inclusiveness requires that AI for health be designed to encourage the widest possible equitable use and access, irrespective of age, sex, gender, income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or other characteristics protected under human rights codes. Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable. Designers, developers and users should continuously and transparently assess AI applications during actual use to determine whether AI responds adequately and appropriately to expectations and requirements. AI systems should also be designed to minimize their environmental consequences and increase energy efficiency.

", "note_en": "Sunnyvale-based, Israeli-founded JFrog is publicly traded on Nasdaq, where it went public last September, and currently it has a market cap of  $4.65 billion. Vdoo, meanwhile, had raised about $70 million from investors that include NTT, Dell, GGV and Verizon (disclaimer: Verizon owns TechCrunch), and when we covered its  most recent funding round, we estimated that the valuation was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, making this a decent return.\n Shlomi Ben Haim, JFrog\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said that his company\u2019s turn to focusing deeper on security, and making this acquisition in particular to fill out that strategy, are a natural progression in its aim to built out an end-to-end platform for the DevOps team.\n  \u201cWhen we started JFrog, the main challenge was to educate the market on what we saw as most important priorities when it comes to building, testing and deploying software,\u201d he said. Then sometime around 2015-2016 he said they started to realize there was a \u201ccrack\u201d in the system, \u201ca crack called security.\u201d InfoSec engineers and developers sometimes work at cross purposes, as \u201cdevelopers became too fast\u201d the work they were doing was inadvertently led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.\n JFrog has been building a number of tools since then to address that and to bring the collective priorities together, such as its XRay product. And indeed, Vdoo is not JFrog\u2019s first foray into security, but it represents a significant step deeper into the hardware and systems that are being run on software. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important leap forward,\u201d Ben Haim said.\n For its part, Vdoo was born out of a realization as well as a challenging mission: IoT and other connected devices \u2014 a universe of some 50 billion pieces of hardware as of last year \u2014 represents a massive security headache, and not just because of the volume of devices: each object uses and interacts with software in the cloud and so each instance represents a potential vulnerability, with zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among some of the most common.\n While connected-device security up to now has typically focused on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it, Vdoo\u2019s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves on top of that, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. Interestingly, this mirrors the kind of binary analysis that JFrog provides in its DevOps platform, making the two complementary to each other.\n But what\u2019s notable is that this will give JFrog a bigger play at the edge, since part of Vdoo\u2019s platform works on devices themselves, \u201cmicro agents\u201d as the company has described them to me previously, to detect and repair vulnerabilities on endpoints.\n While JFrog has built a lot of its own business from the ground up, it has made a number of acquisitions to bolt on technology (one example:  Shippable, which it used to bring continuous integration and delivery into its DevOps platform). In this case, Netanel Davidi, the co-founder and CEO of Vdoo (who previously co-founded and sold another security startup, Cyvera,  to Palo Alto Networks) said that this was a good fit because the two companies are fundamentally taking the same approaches in their work (another synergy and justification for DevOps and InfoSec being more closely knitted together too I might add).\n \u201cIn terms of the fit between the companies, it\u2019s about our approach to binaries,\u201d Davidi said in an interview, noting that the two being on the same page with this approach was fundamental to the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s only the way to cover the entire pipeline from the very beginning, when they go you develop something, all the way to the device or to the server or to the application or to the mobile phone. That\u2019s the only way to truly understand the context and contextual risk.\u201d\n He also made a note not just of the tech but of the talent that is coming on with the acquisition: 100 people joining JFrog\u2019s 800.\n \u201cIf JFrog chose to build something like this themselves, they could have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the uniqueness here is that we have built the best security team, the best security researchers, the best vulnerability researchers, the best reverse engineers, which focus not only on embedded systems, and IoT, which is considered to be the hardest thing to learn and to analyze, but also in software artifacts. We are bringing this knowledge along with us.\u201d\n JFrog said that Vdoo will continue to operate as a standalone SaaS product for the time being. Updates that are made will be in aid of supporting the JFrog platform and the two aim to have a fully integrated, \u201cholistic\u201d product by 2022.\n Along with the deal,\u00a0JFrog reiterated financial guidance for the next quarter that will end June 30, 2021. It expects revenues of $47.6 million to $48.6 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5 million to $1.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.01, assuming approximately 104 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For Full Year 2021, revenues are expected to be $198 million to $204 million,\u00a0with non-GAAP operating income between $5 million and $7 million and an approximately 3% increase in weighted average diluted shares. JFrog anticipates consolidated operating expenses to increase by approximately $9-10 million for the remainder of 2021, subject to the acquisition closing.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:35",

-0.53%  as a client for their goods and services can find that its business comes with a catch: the right for Amazon to buy big stakes in their companies at potentially steep discounts to market value.\n  The technology-and-retail giant has struck at least a dozen deals with publicly traded companies in which it gets rights, called warrants, to buy the vendors\u2019 stock in the future at what could be below-market prices, according to corporate filings and interviews with people involved with the deals.\n  Amazon over the past decade also has done more than 75 such deals with privately held companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In all, the tech titan\u2019s stakes and potential stakes amount to billions of dollars across companies that provide everything from call-center services to natural gas, and in some cases position Amazon among the top shareholders in those businesses.\n  The unusual arrangements offer another window into how Amazon uses its market heft to increase its wealth and clout. The company has been under growing  scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its competitive practices,  including with companies it partners with.\n  While the deals can benefit the suppliers by locking in big contracts, which can also boost their share prices, executives at several of the companies said they felt they couldn\u2019t refuse Amazon\u2019s push for the right to buy the stock without risking a major contract. The deals in some cases also give Amazon rights such as board representation and the ability to top any acquisition offers from other companies.\n  For Amazon, the arrangements give it a piece of the potential upside their vendors can get from doing business with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\n  Amazon routinely leverages its size and power to force terms that benefit itself, including by getting  partners in one business to sign on to its other services; learning about  up-and-coming technology companies through its venture-capital fund; or  creating top selling Amazon branded goods that compete with small sellers on its site. It has aggressively competed to wrest market share from rivals, which Amazon says results in better deals for shoppers.\n  In its supplier deals that include warrants, Amazon throws its weight around to exact lucrative terms, knowing many companies won\u2019t refuse, according to former Amazon executives who worked on the deals.\n  An Amazon spokeswoman said the warrants it obtains in commercial agreements are typically tied to milestones that Amazon has to meet, such as large purchases from the supplier. The company declined to comment on specific deals, or say how many warrants it has exercised or the amount of money it has made from such agreements. The spokeswoman said it has warrant deals in fewer than 1% of the commercial agreements it enters into.\n  Grocery distributor  SpartanNash  last year amended a contract with Amazon to deliver groceries to its Amazon Fresh arm. The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company had been supplying Amazon with food since 2016, but this time Amazon added a condition: if it bought $8 billion worth of groceries over seven years, it could get warrants to purchase around 15% of SpartanNash\u2019s stock at a price potentially lower than the market. Amazon also said it wanted to be notified of any takeover offers for SpartanNash and have a 10-day window to offer a counterbid.\n    SpartanNash executives were taken aback, said people familiar with the matter. No customer had requested such terms before. Executives ultimately decided they didn\u2019t want to haggle with one of SpartanNash\u2019s biggest customers, and that being tied to Amazon could raise their company\u2019s profile, one of the people said. Amazon received warrants in the company when the deal was announced that would amount to 2.5% of its stock if exercised. If it receives and exercises warrants for the additional 12.5%, according to the contract terms, it would be SpartanNash\u2019s second-largest shareholder after mutual-fund manager BlackRock Inc.\n    Amazon has been doing such deals with vendors for about a decade but has aggressively increased the practice in the past few years, said former Amazon executives and lawyers who worked on structuring the deals. In its latest quarterly report, the company valued its warrants at $2.8 billion, more than five times the level three years ago. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the value of stakes it owns as a result of exercising its warrants.\n  A broader measure of its warrants and the stakes it holds in companies through warrants, direct investment or other ways increased 10 times to $8.4 billion in that period, according to Amazon\u2019s quarterly filings.\n  Like stock options, warrants let the holder buy a company\u2019s shares at a set price during a set period. If the stock surpasses that strike price, the warrant holder can buy shares at a below-market price.\n  Corporate executives in a range of industries and lawyers said Amazon\u2019s push to get warrants as part of vendor deals is highly unusual. Warrant deals have more commonly been used by investors who back companies in financial trouble, in deals deemed high risk.\n    Former Amazon executives who worked on warrant deals said they found no direct precedent before the company began striking them. For a guide, an Amazon team sleuthed through financial documents from the 2008 financial crisis to find information about bank bailouts that involved warrants, one of the people said.\n  The Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a few examples of other companies striking warrant arrangements. In 2017,  Walmart  obtained warrants in  Plug Power  a few months after Amazon struck a commercial deal tied to warrants with the company. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company very infrequently obtains warrants in other companies. Plug Power declined to comment.\n  Some suppliers see granting Amazon warrants as a worthwhile competitive advantage.  Clean Energy Fuels  struck a deal with Amazon earlier this year that could give the larger company a 20% stake over the next decade, making it the No. 2 shareholder. Management had never done a commercial deal where it gave the customer warrants, according to a person familiar with the matter, but Amazon had put out a large request for proposals from other natural-gas companies, and Clean Energy determined that accepting the terms of warrants would keep Amazon from choosing to do more business with competitors, the person said. As part of the terms, Clean Energy must notify Amazon if it receives a takeover offer, the person said. Clean Energy declined to comment.\n  Amazon\u2019s first major warrants deal with a publicly traded vendor came in 2016. Amazon was seeking a partner with cargo planes to help build out its massive logistics network. Executives reasoned that the company\u2019s potential partners were all smaller, lesser-known companies with stagnant growth, and that a major contract from Amazon would invigorate their stocks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon wanted some of that potential upside, the person said.\n  Amazon proposed a deal, with warrants, to Wilmington, Ohio-based  Air Transport Services Group  The aircraft-leasing company initially pushed back on the warrant stipulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Its team flew to Seattle and had \u201cintense, protracted negotiations\u201d where Amazon got ATSG to agree to the structure, one of the people said. \u201cIt took a lot of convincing,\u201d the person said. Amazon currently owns around 19.5% of ATSG, making it the biggest shareholder.\n      Amazon executives knew it would need to lease many more planes to handle explosive growth in its delivery operation, and the initial warrant deal emboldened them to demand similar terms from other companies, said one of the people involved.\n  In talks with  Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Amazon broached a 10-year leasing deal, with similar terms. This time Amazon demanded warrants that would amount to up to 20% of Atlas\u2019s equity over five years\u2014with an option for 10% more later\u2014depending on how much business it gave Atlas. Amazon also wanted the right to elect a director to Atlas\u2019s board, after meeting certain milestones.\n  People involved on both sides said that warrants were a condition of Amazon partnering with Atlas. \u201cThere was definitely a sense that if it wasn\u2019t agreed to there wouldn\u2019t be a deal,\u201d said one of the people. Atlas executives didn\u2019t want to pass up the revenue opportunity from Amazon and viewed giving up the warrants as the price of doing business with Amazon, said the person.\n  When it announced the deal in May 2016, Atlas lauded the deal, including the equity arrangement. Its share price soared 27% that day. Such jumps have been common when Amazon has done warrant deals with publicly traded suppliers\u2014SpartanNash\u2019s stock rose 26% on the day it announced its agreement.\n  The strike price for the Atlas warrants was $37.50, slightly below where the shares were trading before the deal was announced. Amazon later exercised warrants for 9% of Atlas\u2019 stock and sold the shares, according to an Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon declined to comment on how much it made on its sale of Atlas stock.\n    Atlas has never done a similar deal, according to the Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon never named a director to Atlas\u2019s board, she said.\n    Amazon also signed a vendor deal with  Cargojet  that included warrants. Cargojet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Amazon often ties its warrants to how much business it gives a supplier. In a deal with Startek Inc., the Colorado-based call-center company agreed to give Amazon the right to acquire 20% of its shares if Amazon does $600 million of business with Startek over eight years. That would make Amazon Startek\u2019s second-largest shareholder, if it were to obtain the warrants and exercise them. Startek didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Former Amazon executives said they avoided doing anything during supplier negotiations, such as putting its ultimatums in writing, that would give fodder to critics who have said Amazon abuses its power. One of the former executives said that most companies complied with its demands over warrants. Several former Amazon executives who worked on such deals said in interviews that they found them to be unfair and one-sided, saying the companies weren\u2019t in a position to refuse and that most of the upside went to Amazon.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u5e02\u573a,docs", "title": "\u6d88\u606f\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6587\u4ef6\uff1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5408\u540c\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5728\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u4e2d\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u5236\u5b9a\u4e8680\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6743\u529b ", "title_en": "Sources and docs: as part of contracts, Amazon has made 80+ deals for stakes in suppliers, often at below-market prices, a sign of how it leverages its power", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-demands-one-more-thing-from-some-vendors-a-piece-of-their-company-11624968099?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u5e02\u573a", "docs"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1b2f6fa28c0d3417726fdfb5e6436695.jpg", "infoid": 1068547, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8054\u76df\uff0c\u4f26\u6566\uff0c6\u670829\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 -  TP ICAP\uff08TCAPI.L\uff09\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u5927\u7684Instumer\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4eba\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u5bcc\u8fbe\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u8bb8\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6570\u7801\u8d44\u4ea7\u76d1\u62a4\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u3002\n \u673a\u6784\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u90e8\u95e8\u52a0\u70ed\u5230\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5e74\u4e0b\u534a\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5141\u8bb8\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ea4\u6613\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u592a\u7f51\u5c06\u88ab\u7a0d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002\n TP ICAP\u548c12\u6708\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\uff08Stan.l\uff09\u548c\u5317\u65b9\u4fe1\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u5317\u6781\u4fe1\u6258\u961f\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u5bcc\u8fbe\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548cZodia\u76d1\u62a4\u6743\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u5c06\u52a0\u5bc6\u4ea4\u6613\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u503a\u5238\u548c\u5916\u56fd\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\n \u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u4fdd\u7ba1\u4eba\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d38\u6613\u8d38\u6613\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5355\u72ec\u6267\u884c\u548c\u7ed3\u7b97\uff0c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u538c\u6076\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u52a0\u5bc6\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\n \u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u6267\u884c\u548c\u76d1\u62a4\u670d\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u5730\u4e2d\u5377\u8d77\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u7528\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u4e39\u7684\u6d41\u91cf\u4ea4\u6613\u5458\u5c06\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002\n TP ICAP\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u6790\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u63a8\u51fa\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u7403\u8d44\u672c\u5e02\u573a\u6269\u5927\u4e86\u5176\u5360\u5730\u9762\u79ef\u3002\n \u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u91d1\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u5531\u7247\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u94f6\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u9053\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u4e0e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u90e8\u95e8\u957f\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u5934\u75db\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u589e\u52a0\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5fc5\u987b\u5e73\u8861\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a \n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u4e3e\u63aa\u662f\u6e23\u6253\u94f6\u884c\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8ba4\u53ef\uff0c\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u5355\u4f4d\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u548c\u6b27\u6d32\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u7ecf\u7eaa\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0e\u9999\u6e2f\uff06\uff0339;

Amsterdam-based Flow Traders will provide liquidity to the platform.\n TP ICAP has broadened its footprint in global capital markets by offering new data and analytics services and rolling out new products.\n Dedicated crypto funds have seen record flows this year but major banks offering access must balance growing interest with the compliance headaches long associated with the cryptocurrency sector and increasing scrutiny by regulators.   read more\n Still, the move is the latest endorsement of the sector by Standard Chartered, whose venture capital unit said earlier this month it will set up a separate crypto brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, with Hong Kong&#39;s BC Technology Group  (0863.HK).   read more\n &#34;Investor interest in this new asset class has exploded dramatically in the last six to eight months,&#34; Duncan Trenholme, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP, told Reuters. &#34;In most of our conversations with clients, they want a separation of custodial roles from execution capabilities which is opposite to the models that exist currently.&#34;\n TP ICAP launched bitcoin futures and options on CME in 2019 and now plans to launch other derivative products including total return swaps and non-deliverable forwards.\n The platform is awaiting approval by Britain&#39;s financial regulator. Neither Standard Chartered nor Fidelity Investments have invested in the platform, TP ICAP said.\n (This story refiles to add dropped letters to name in headline, 9th and 11th paragraphs)",

One of the most revealing bits of its story? It\u2019s a route to monetization as a then rare edtech consumer business based outside of Silicon Valley. The company has had a somewhat circuitous journey \u2014 full of trial and error \u2014 on finding the perfect business model. It eventually landed on subscriptions, despite an original distaste for it thanks to its mission to provide free education.\n   The vast majority of Duolingo\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions. In the most recent calendar year, for example, the edtech giant generated 73% of its total top line from subscription incomes. That revenue was followed by advertising incomes and the Duolingo English Test (DET), which represented 17% and 10% of its top line in 2020. (Notably, von Ahn hoped that  the DET would be 20% of Duolingo\u2019s revenue by 2019, a figure that it failed to reach by some margin.)\n  Its multi-part business model appears to be paying off. The company\u2019s revenue grew from $70.8 million in 2019 to $161.7 million in 2020, a 129% increase. Of course some of that growth would have happened sans the recent global pandemic, but it\u2019s not hard to see some COVID-related acceleration in the figures. Duolingo also reported $55.4 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2021, representing a 97% growth from the year-ago period.\n  But in more strict accounting terms, net losses have grown for Duolingo. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, for example, the company had net losses of 13.5 million, a sharp increase compared to the same period last year when it had net losses of $2.2 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s GAAP net losses expanded from $13.6 million to $15.8 million.\n It should be noted that the company\u2019s net margin improved in 2020, as its revenue more than doubled and its losses barely crept higher. The company\u2019s profitability or lack thereof should not prove to be a problem during its impending listing.\n In its S-1 filing, Duolingo provided a placeholder $100 million figure for the funds it expects to raise; we\u2019ll get a better idea of how much capital the edtech unicorn may onboard during its IPO when it sets an IPO price range after its roadshow.\n The former startup is effectively the kick-off to the Q3 2021 IPO season, one that several inventors have told TechCrunch will be more than active.\n Duolingo has raised $183.3 million in venture capital to date. Investors that have meaningful stakes in the company include NewView Capital, Union Square Ventures, CapitalG, Kleiner Perkins, and General Atlantic, which  recently got a spot on the cap table through a secondary transaction.\n At a run rate of around $220 million today and growth of more than 100%, Duolingo should not have a problem clearing its privately set $2.4 billion price tag. Unless public-market investors are concerned that the edtech market\u2019s growth is mostly behind it. That Duolingo grew by nearly 100% in the first quarter could temper such concerns.\n   TechCrunch is still digging its way through Duolingo\u2019s IPO filing, but we\u2019ve found a number of details that add more than a little color to its recent growth and business results. Here are some standouts:\n A \u201crecord low\u201d attrition rate in 2020 in which only four employees, or 2% of its workforce left the company.\n The company eventually plans to launch a \u201cDuolingo Proficiency Score\u201d across its offered languages, with the hopes of creating a \u201cwidely accepted indicator of language proficiency level and make Duolingo a global proficiency standard.\u201d\n It cited Apple\u2019s \u201cTranslate\u201d tool, an iOS app launched in 2020 that allows users to translate text sentences or speech between several languages, as a competitor in the \u2018risk factors\u2019 section.\n And finally,  it confirmed that it is seeking potential acquisition candidates to add complementary services to its startup.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:14:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6587\u4ef6,revenue,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u6587\u4ef6\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fdIPO\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e862020\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e86129\uff05\uff0c\u5e76\u57282021\u5b63\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\u4e8655.4\u7c73\u7684\u6536\u5165 ", "title_en": "Duolingo files for US IPO, reveals revenue growth of 129% YoY in 2020, and reports $55.4M in revenue during Q1 2021", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u6587\u4ef6", "revenue", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dbc11a87287f30bad92adbdda938a83e.jpeg", "infoid": 1068544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60e0\u666e\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4eadAero 13\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339; S\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u5f0f\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u3002\u8be5\u5668\u4ef6\u91cd\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e00\u5343\u514b\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5ea7\u4ead\u5b50\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u5177\u670990\uff05\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u5230\u8eab\u4f53\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u3002\n 13.3\u82f1\u5bf8\u673a\u5668\u5177\u67092.5K\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff0c16:10\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\uff0c400\u4e2a\u4eae\u5ea6\u548c100\uff05\u7684SRGB\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u3002 Pavilion Aero 13\u5177\u6709WiFi 6\u652f\u6301\u548cAI\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u8bdd\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u7d22\u8d54\u60a8\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u5145\u7535\u8fbe\u523010.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u7531AMD Ryzen 5000\u7cfb\u5217\u5904\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5185\u7f6eRadeon Graphics\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u8fbeRyzen 7 5800U\u3002\n   Pavillion Aero 13\u7531\u6d88\u8d39\u540e\u518d\u751f\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u6210\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u6027\u6d82\u6599\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53f0\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u662fEPEAT\u91d1\u724c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4e4b\u661f\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62e5\u6709\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684PC\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4e8e7\u6708\u4efd\u901a\u8fc7HP.com\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5b83\u59cb\u4e8e749\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; ll\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u79cb\u5929\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u6361\u8d77\u6765\u3002\n  \u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60e0\u666e\u5c06\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e3a\u5176M\u7cfb\u5217\u663e\u793a\u5668\u9635\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u6b21\u8865\u5145\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728CES\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u6761\u7ebf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Eyesafe\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0cHP\u7d22\u8d54\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u84dd\u8272\u5149\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u989c\u8272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u6536\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u9020\u7684\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u5305\u62ec24\u548c27\u82f1\u5bf8\u578b\u53f7\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u97f3\u9891\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; 7\u6708\u4efd\u53ef\u7528\uff0c24\u82f1\u5bf8\u663e\u793a\u5668\u8d77\u4ef7\u4e3a230\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u51e1\u4eba\u552e\u4ef7\u4e3a290\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n   ENGADGET\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u7531\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u56e2\u961f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6545\u4e8b\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u8054\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002\n   \u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u66f4\u65b0\u60a8\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u3002 ", "note_en": "HP has unveiled the Pavilion Aero 13, which is the company&#39;s lightest consumer laptop yet.

", "note_en": "Accel and Canapi Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from existing backers Bain Capital Ventures, Inspired Capital, Homebrew, Acrew, Primary, Clocktower and Box Group. The financing comes barely three months after Orum announced a $21 million Series A, and brings  its total raised to over $82 million.\n Orum CEO Stephany Kirkpatrick launched the company in 2019 after working for  several years at LearnVest, a personal finance site founded by Alexa von Tobel that was acquired by Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an estimated $375 million. Tobel went on to form Inspired Capital, a venture capital firm that put money in Orum\u2019s   $5.2 million seed round  last August. Prior to that, the firm also provided Orum  with an \u201cinspiration check\u201d that was the first money into the business.\n  As a certified financial planner, Kirkpatrick says she saw firsthand what she describes as \u201cdeep cracks\u201d in this country\u2019s financial infrastructure. The fact that it takes days for money to move from one bank to another is not only inconvenient for many, but unnecessary, she believes.\n \u201cMost Americans are not familiar with the intricacies of ACH [automated clearing house) or why it takes multiple business days to move money between accounts,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cBut none of us can allow money to wait 5-7 days to hit our accounts. It needs to be instant.\u201d\n Her mission with Orum is straightforward even if the technology behind it is complex. Put simply, Orum aims to use machine learning-backed APIs to \u201cmove money smartly across all payment rails, and in doing so, provide universal financial access.\u201d\n Orum\u2019s first embeddable product, Foresight, launched in September of 2020. It\u2019s an automated programming interface designed to give financial institutions a way to move money in real time. The platform uses machine learning and data science to  predict when funds are available and to identify any potential risks. Its Momentum product \u201cintelligently\u201d routes funds across payments rails and is powered by banking providers JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank.\n \u201cThey power the back end of our Momentum platform that allows the money to move on a multirail basis,\u201d Kirkpatrick told TechCrunch. \u201cThey power our access to real-time payments.\u201d\n Orum says it serves a range of enterprise partners, including Alloy, HM Bradley, First Horizon Bank and Zero Financial (which was   recently acquired by Avant ).\n The volume of transactions being conducted with Orum is growing 100% month over month, Kirkpatrick said. Most of its early growth has come from word of mouth.\n The remote-first company prides itself on diversity \u2014 in both its employee and investor base. For one, 48% of its 55-person headcount are female, and 48% are \u201cnonwhite,\u201d according to Kirkpatrick. Orum also recently joined the   Cap Table Coalition  \u2014 a partnership between high-growth startups and emerging investors who want to work to close the racial wealth gap \u2014 to allocate over 10% of its Series B round to underrepresented founders. For example, the financing includes investors such as the Neythri Features Fund, a group of South Asian women investing in the next generation of female founders and diverse teams.\n Jeffrey Reitman, partner at Canapi Ventures (a firm whose LPs mostly consist of banks), told TechCrunch that those bank LPs  conduct hundreds of millions of ACH transactions annually,\n \u201cThey need a path to achieving a state where funds can be transferred instantly,\u201d he said. \u201cOrum\u2019s product paves the path for many players in financial services and fintech \u2014 and beyond \u2014 to partake in faster money movement without compromising key risk principles.\u201d\n To Reitman, the company\u2019s major differentiators are its team, which he describes as consisting of \u201cthe best group of data scientists and engineers in the space.\u201d\n \u201cMany of their customers consider the team to be instrumental in helping to set the risk dials on how they fund transactions by teasing out key data and insights from historical transaction data,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, Orum is building one of the densest and most comprehensive data sets around the risks of money movement.

That figure was up 30% over 2019, the company noted. And of those 45 million people, 15 million were children.\n While the pandemic\u2019s impacts are starting subside as businesses are reopening and in-person activities are resuming, many children will still go hungry during the summer months when school lunch programs become unavailable.\n  To help address this need and others related to food insecurity, Google\u2019s new website available at  g.co/findfoodsupport offers a combination of food support resources, YouTube videos about the problem of food insecurity in the U.S., and a Google Maps locator tool that will direct people to their nearby food bank or other food support locations.\n Google says it worked with organizations including No Kid Hungry, FoodFinder, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to capture 90,000 places offering free food support across the 50 U.S. states. Using the online tool, website visitors can type in their location to see school meal program pickup sites, food banks and food pantries in their area.\n  The tool will display the location\u2019s address, phone number and other details \u2014 like which days it\u2019s open or business hours.\n Although you can find this information in Google Maps directly, it can be more difficult if you don\u2019t know the right keywords to use. For example, a search \u201cfood support\u201d returned a combination of charities, food banks and public services alongside businesses with matching keywords, like \u201cFood Lion\u201d and \u201cLowe\u2019s Foods.\u201d A search for \u201cfood assistance\u201d was more complete, but also returned unrelated results, like the \u201cUS Food &amp; Drug Administration.\u201d The online tool\u2019s search results will be more precise and accurate.\n The new website also highlights other food support information, including SNAP benefit information; support for specific groups, like seniors, children, and families; state-by-state benefit guidelines; and food support hotlines. For those not facing food support issues, it offers information on how to donate money, time or food to those in need.\n The site additionally features a handful of YouTube videos published by organizations across the country who are working to address food insecurity issues in their own communities. The videos aim to destigmatize food insecurity by showing how all types of people use food support \u2014 including military families, children, and seniors. Google says 1 in 9 active-duty military families experience food insecurity, as do 1 in 6 children, 1 in 3 college students, and over 5 million seniors, for example.\n The new site is the result of an effort by Google\u2019s \u201cFood for Good,\u201d headed by  Emily Ma. Food for Good originally began as an early stage moonshot project (from Alphabet\u2019s X, formerly Google[x])  known as Project Delta, which focused on creating a smarter food system.

The new version of Office is currently in beta, available to  Office Insiders.\n Microsoft also announced  a redesign of Office, which you can see above and below. While it uses a similar design to Windows 11, it\u2019ll be available whether you&#39;re running the Windows 11 Preview or Windows 10. In addition to the new design, Office will also adapt to your Windows light / dark mode, so you should be able to avoid the experience of opening a document and having it blast light into your eyes at night.\n   Microsoft hasn\u2019t shied away from talking about Arm with Windows 11. Its  contentious list of supported CPUs  includes a handful of Qualcomm chips, and it  used the Arm-powered Surface Pro X to show off the tablet capabilities of its new OS. For those with Arm machines, it\u2019s probably a good sign \u2014 having native apps is likely going to be more efficient than emulation, and provide better performance.\n It is, however, perhaps a little awkward that it took so long for a 64-bit Arm version of Office to come to Windows \u2014  M1 Macs got a native version late last year. There are also a few features that Microsoft mentions haven&#39;t come to the Arm version of Office yet, though that\u2019s to be expected given that it\u2019s currently in beta.\n In addition to being in the Office Insider program, those who want to test out 64-bit Office on their Arm Windows machine will also have to be running  the Windows 11 Insider Preview. They\u2019ll also have to uninstall any 32-bit versions of Office they may have installed before reinstalling Office and updating to the beta version.

See our  ethics statement.\n Microsoft is releasing its first Windows 11 preview build today. Windows Insiders can download the Windows 11 preview ( build 22000.51) right now, which includes access to the new Start menu, multitasking features, and overhauled Microsoft Store. Unlike the  previous Windows 11 leak, this official preview also features an updated File Explorer that replaces the ribbon with a command bar to simplify file management a little more.\n Most of the Windows 11 visual changes that Microsoft revealed last week will be available in this initial preview. The new Start menu with its centered launcher-like interface is part of this build, alongside rounded corners throughout the OS and improvements to the notification center, volume flyouts, and more. If your PC has an accelerometer, the Windows 11 lock screen will also include a parallax motion effect.\n   Windows 11\u2019s new themes and dark / light mode improvements are also part of this preview, alongside the new Widgets feature. All of the new themes \u2014 Glow, Captured Motion, Sunrise, and Flow \u2014 are designed with the centered taskbar in mind, and Microsoft has coupled them with new sounds in Windows 11 as you use the OS.\n Two big Windows 11 features are missing, though:  Microsoft Teams integration and  Android apps on Windows. Both are still being developed and tested by Microsoft but will appear in later preview builds.\n   This Windows 11 preview also includes Microsoft\u2019s new Snap Groups and Snap Layouts features, to improve multitasking across a variety of screen sizes. These new Snap features build on a lot of the multitasking features that have been in Windows for years but make them easier to discover and more useful \u2014 particularly in multiple-monitor scenarios.\n Microsoft is also overhauling the Settings section of Windows 11. This preview build include changes that make it easier to navigate around and find the setting you need. Settings now has a left-hand navigation panel that persists throughout, making it quicker to switch between sections. Microsoft has built new \u201chero\u201d controls at the top that offer quick access to information or settings that are relevant for each section.\n   Alongside the Windows 11 preview today, Microsoft is also releasing a preview of its Office refresh for Windows 11. The updated UI includes rounded corners in Office apps to match Windows 11 and some changes to how the dark and light modes work.\n If you\u2019re interested in testing the Windows 11 preview build, you\u2019ll need to  enroll in the Windows Insiders program and then navigate to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Insider Program on a Windows 10 device to enable the Dev Channel and obtain Windows 11 builds.\n You\u2019ll need a compatible machine, although Microsoft says it\u2019s waiving its  new hardware requirements during this preview period for those who have been testing Windows builds prior to June 24th. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to use  Microsoft\u2019s PC Health Check app to see if your system is compatible.\n We wouldn\u2019t recommend installing these previews on a machine you use daily, as there will be bugs and unfinished features. In fact, Microsoft has a  number of known issues it lists, and these are the important ones you should be aware of:\n the taskbar will not be shown across multiple monitors (will be fixed in an upcoming build)\n when upgrading a device with multiple user accounts to Windows 11, Settings will fail to launch\n the Microsoft Store install button might not be functional yet in \u201csome limited scenarios\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:12:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,windows,android,releases", "title":

", "note_en": "To improve developer security on the Play Store, Google is  requiring those that develop for Android to abide by 2-Step Verification and new identity requirements later this year.\n  The first requirement is 2-Step Verification (2SV) when signing into the Play Console. This is a way to prevent account and app hijacking, thus keeping end users safe. It follows Google\u2019s  broad push to encourage 2FA adoption. Besides your username and password, you have to verify it\u2019s really you signing in with either a prompt sent to your phone or a  physical security key.\n New Google Play developer accounts will need to enable 2-Step Verification in August, with the requirement enforced on existing ones \u201clater this year.\u201d\n Meanwhile, Google is introducing \u201cDeveloper identification requirements\u201d to \u201chelp us better understand your needs.\u201d In addition to providing your email address and phone number, the following information will also be required:\n  This information will not be listed publicly, and just meant to help confirm who you are and communicate:\n Your contact information allows us to share important information and updates about your app. It also helps us make sure that every account is created by a real person with real contact details, which helps us keep the Play Store safe for all users.\n Starting today, developers can specify their account type and verify contact details. This is optional for now but will be a requirement for new users in August. Existing accounts will be required to submit this year.\u00a0Google also offers the following best practices:\n Keep your contact information active and up to date. We may occasionally check if your account is active by emailing or calling the account owner using the details provided, so it is important that they are accurate.\n Consider using a contact email address different from the one that you use to create your Google account, especially if your developer account will have multiple users or is for an organization or business. You might want to consider setting up a dedicated shared inbox for this purpose so that the right set of people within your team or organization can access these important messages. We encourage you to use an email address from your own domain if you have one.\n The contact email address for an organization or business account should not be a generic or personal email address. Make sure to use an email address associated with your organization.\n  You\u2019re reading 9to5Google \u2014 experts who break news about Google and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.
