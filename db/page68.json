Last night, the HFPA\u2019s Golden Globes Twitter account regularly  forgot to note which TV or movie projects Globe recipients were winning for \u2014 like how  Andrew Garfield\u2019s win was for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d, for example \u2014 when it was announcing the night\u2019s winners on social media. The organization also oddly referred to \u201cWest Side Story\u2019s\u201d laughter (?) as being \u201cthe best medicine,\u201d in a tweet it later deleted, only to be posted again to say that  music was the best medicine \u2014 which is not how that saying goes.\n  Nowhere in these deeply chaotic Golden Globe tweets do they even mention the projects people are winning for  pic.twitter.com/4Tt5CHaojE\n  In addition to being an overall quieter year as the HFPA tries to reform its organization following the controversies, the winning networks also aren\u2019t touting their victories as they would normally, despite some seeing some notable firsts and upsets.\n  In prior years, HBO would be happily promoting its sweep over rivals. The network led the night with six wins, including four for HBO and two for HBO Max. Several of these were for its TV series \u201cSuccession,\u201d which won for best TV drama, TV drama actor (Jeremy Strong), and supporting actress (Sarah Snook.) HBO Max\u2019s comedy \u201cHacks\u201d also notably beat out Emmy winner \u201cTed Lasso\u201d (Apple TV+) as best comedy, and saw its lead, Jean Smart, win for best actress in a comedy. And Kate Winslet won best TV actress in a limited series for HBO\u2019s \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d.\n Meanwhile, though Netflix  led the year by nominations \u2014 including for best dramatic film \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and drama series \u201cSquid Game\u201d \u2014 it had said it wouldn\u2019t participate in the event until the HFPA institutes changes. That decision means it\u2019s also now not bragging about a couple of notable firsts that resulted from last night\u2019s awards.\n Netflix\u2019s big win of the night was for its original film, \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d which became the streamer\u2019s first-ever movie to take home a Golden Globe for best motion picture (drama). The movie also won for best director (Jane Campion) and best supporting actor (Kodi Smit-McPhee).\n In addition, Netflix\u2019s runaway hit TV series \u201cSquid Game\u201d received three nominations this year, leading to  the first-ever win for South Korea, as South Korean actor O Yeong-su won for his role in the series, beating out \u201cSuccession\u2019s\u201d Kieran Culkin (HBO) and \u201cThe Morning Show\u2019s\u201d Billy Crudup (Apple TV+).\n Netflix also won for \u201ctick, tick\u2026BOOM!\u201d when Andrew Garfield took the trophy for best actor in a motion picture (musical or comedy), though the tweet had forgotten to credit the project by name.\n Apple TV+ took home one win last night as \u201cTed Lasso\u2019s\u201d Jason Sudeikis won best actor in a TV series (comedy). Hulu also got one Globe, as \u201cDopesick\u2019s\u201d Michael Keaton won best actor in a TV limited series or motion picture made for television, while Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d won the category. Amazon Prime Video\u2019s \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d was highlighted with Nicole Kidman\u2019s win as best actress in a motion picture.\n In another milestone, the first trans actress to win a Golden Globe, FX\u2019s \u201cPose\u201d star Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, took home the trophy for best actress in a drama.\n 20th Century Studio/Disney\u2019s \u201cWest Side Story\u201d won best picture (musical or comedy) and its stars, Rachel Zegler and Ariana DeBose won best actress and supporting actress, respectively. Disney\u2019s \u201cEncanto,\u201d which streamed on Disney+ just a month after hitting theaters, won best animated picture.\n Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cDune\u201d got the trophy for best score (Hans Zimmer), and Will Smith was named best actor in a motion picture (drama) for \u201cKing Richard.\u201d\u00a0The best non-English language picture award went to the Japanese film \u201cDrive My

"note_en": "Across cultures and geographies, animals have been such a vital part of the food chain that it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where animals are not put to the knife to produce protein.\n There\u2019s no stopping innovation, however, and alternative sources of protein are increasingly becoming a choice people would rather make.\n Cell-cultured meat is one such source. Also known as cultivated or lab-grown meat, this process uses cells from animals to make meat without slaughter. While the nascent sector is a hot topic for the benefits it promises, the process remains slow and costly.\n Investments in this sector are heating up, though. If 2021 was anything to go by, there is an abundance of both companies and investors hungry for ways to scale and speed up the process \u2014 and do it profitably.\n However, it\u2019s not yet clear when meat grown in labs will reach the kind of scale required to see it at your local grocery store.\n   Cell-cultured meat owes its growing popularity, at least in part, to some of the macro challenges the world faces with food production. Overcultivation, human-made climate change and diminishing sources of water are all contributing to a future where food insecurity will be a gigantic problem.\n The outlook is bleak: The United Nations estimates  food production will need to double to feed the  nearly 10 billion people expected to populate the planet by 2050. As for protein, people around the world  consumed about 324 million metric tons of meat in 2020, and that number is set to  rise even further.\n Changing how we cultivate and produce food is key to solving this problem, and we already have  systems like vertical farming to address the problem of overcultivation, as well as protein sources other than meat. Currently, alternative protein  makes up just about 2% of the animal protein market, but it is expected to increase more than 7x by 2025.\n \u201cWe are trying to meet the  Paris Agreement, but we can\u2019t meet that without addressing the food system and the way we produce meat, eggs and dairy,\u201d said Sharyn Murray, senior investor engagement specialist at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit advocating for reimagined meat production. \u201cThe conversion ratio for calories in versus calories out is seven to eight calories for a chicken for one calorie out, while plant-based is one calorie in and one out.\u201d\n Cultivated meat is just one of the approaches to meeting future demand for protein alongside plant-based and fermentation techniques. Murray and others I spoke to referred to the movement as \u201ca massive transformation of the food system that will take time.\u201d Meaning the shift will not happen overnight, Murray said.\n There is also only one company with cell-cultured meat products available in the market currently: Eat Just, whose subsidiary GOOD Meat has received regulatory approval to produce and sell its cell-cultured meat in Singapore. Eat Just also recently received approval to sell chicken breasts made with cell cultures.\n  Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, said the movement is here even if people are not buying a lot of lab-grown meat yet.\n \u201cIt is still small-scale, and the most important thing we are doing that other companies should do is focus on the design, engineering and full-scale installations of vessels and the supporting systems to make a lot of it.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:56:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u51c6\u5907,cultured,\u8089\u7c7b", "title": "\u7ec6\u80de\u57f9\u517b\u7684\u8089\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u5417\uff1f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIs cell-cultured meat ready for prime time?\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/is-cell-cultured-meat-ready-for-prime-time/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51c6\u5907", "cultured", "\u8089\u7c7b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "01bfee01639abb80ed1d27623c21a6b5.jpg", "infoid": 1072647, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e11\u670826\u65e5\u9996\u6b21\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bf4\u9ed1\u5ba2\u662f\u5426\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u4efb\u4f55\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u57281\u67087\u65e5\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0cPanasonic\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e86\u4e0e\u7533\u8bf7\u5c31\u4e1a\u6216\u53c2\u52a0\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u67d0\u4e9b\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5b9e\u4e60\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u6709\u5173\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u677e\u4e0b\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u901a\u77e5\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4eba\u3002\nPanasonic\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd8\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u572811\u670811\u65e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\uff0c\u572811\u67083\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u5e76\u4e8e11\u67083\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732 - \u5c1a\u672a\u547d\u540d\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u83b7\u53d6\u542b\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u4f19\u4f34\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u672a\u6307\u660e\u7684\u201c\u4e0e\u4e1a\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u5173\u5546\u4e1a\u4f19\u4f34\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u4e0b\u8dcc\u7684\u88c1\u5458\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c11\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u662f\u51fb\u4e2dPanasonic\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u9ed1\u5ba2\u6cc4\u9732\u4e864\u5343\u5146\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8d22\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u3002", "note_en": "At the time of the data breach,  which the company first confirmed on November 26, the company was unable to say whether hackers had accessed any sensitive information.

"note_en": "Anyone running modern production systems knows about testing followed by  gradual or staged rollouts, in which changes to a running system are deployed gradually over a long period of time, to reduce the possibility of accidentally taking down everything at once. For example, the last time I needed to make a change to Google\u2019s core DNS zone files, the change was tested against many many regression tests and then deployed to each of Google\u2019s four name servers, one at a time, over a period of 24 hours. Regression testing checks that the change does not appear to affect answers it shouldn\u2019t have, and then the gradual rollout gives plenty of time for both automated systems and reliability engineers to notice unexpected problems and stop the rollout. NPM\u2019s design choice is the exact opposite. The latest version of colors was promoted to use in all its dependents before any of them had a chance to test it and without any kind of gradual rollout.Users can disable this behavior today, by pinning the exact versions of all their dependencies. For example here is  the fix to aws-cdk. That\u2019s not a good answer, but at least it\u2019s possible. The right path forward for NPM and package managers like it is to stop preferring the latest possible version of all dependencies when installing a new package. Instead, they should prefer to use the dependency versions that the package was actually tested with, or versions as close as possible to those. I call that a   high-fidelity build. In contrast, the people who installed aws-cdk and other packages over the weekend got low-fidelity builds: NPM inserted a new version of colors that the developers of these other packages had never tested against. Users got to test that brand new configuration themselves over the weekend, and the test failed. High-fidelity builds solve both the testing problem and the gradual rollout problem. A new version of colors wouldn\u2019t get picked up by an aws-cdk install until the aws-cdk authors had gotten a chance to test it and push a new version configuration in a new version of aws-cdk. At that point, all new aws-cdk installs would get the new colors, but all the other tools would still be unaffected, until they too tested and officially adopted the new version of colors. There are many ways to produce high-fidelity builds. In Go, a package declares the minimum required version of each dependency, and that\u2019s what the build uses, unless some other constraint in the same build graph requests a newer one. And then, it only uses that specific newer one, not the one that just appeared over the weekend and is entirely untested by anyone. For more about this approach, see \u201c The Principles of Versioning in Go.\u201d Package managers don\u2019t have to adopt Go\u2019s approach exactly. It would be enough, for example, to record the versions that the aws-cdk developers used for their testing and then reuse those versions during the install. In fact, NPM can already record those versions, in a lock file. But  npm install of a new package does not use the information in that package\u2019s lock file to decide the versions of dependencies: lock files are not transitive. NPM also has a new   npm shrinkwrap command, which appears to fix the problem for commands. Most of the authors of commands affected by the colors sabotage should be looking carefully at  npm shrinkwrap today. Kudos to NPM for providing a tool for package authors to protect themselves from this kind of problem. The next step, though, is for NPM to arrange for that kind of protection to happen by default. And then the same protection is needed when installing a new library package as a dependency, not just when installing a command. All this will require more work. Other package managers should take note too.

The   ATL2 was on final approach for the main runaway of the Lann-Bihou\u00e9 naval air base when a culprit started lasering the aircraft. The crew aborted the landing and regained altitude.\n  According to a French Navy statement, the crew then used the ATL2 sensors to \u201cvery accurately\u201d locate the origin of the laser. One of those sensors was likely the Wescam MX-20 EO/IR imaging system. It features an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) allowing for high target location accuracy and georeferencing (basically, the system provides accurate coordinates of the target it is pointing at).\n  As for the initial detection of the laser, it was probably done by the pilot and co-pilot with their \u201cmk1 eyeball\u201d (i.e their own eyes). Two sources with experience flying the ATL2 confirmed to  Naval News that there is no Missile Approach Warning (MAW) or Laser Warning systems onboard. (It is fitted with advanced electronic warfare systems but these are triggered by radar and communication frequencies, not laser). In this situation, the key for the crew is the coordination between the cockpit and the MX-20 operator in the back to \u201cfind and fix\u201d the target. But this is something ATL2 crews routinely train for. In war time scenarios, \u201ctrack and engage\u201d usually follows the \u201cfind and fix\u201d phase\u2026\n  As for the events on 4 January, the crew identified the culprit and recorded evidence of the offense with the sensor. While still in flight, the \u201csky sailors\u201d (as naval aircrews are called in the French Navy) transmitted these elements to the local police station, who quickly arrested the person and confiscated his equipment. Charges have been pressed and the investigation is ongoing.\n  Unfortunately, it is not the first time ATL2 crews are faced with the problem. Someone was   sentenced to six months in jail for similar acts at the same naval air base in 2018. According to local newspaper  Ouest France, the commander of the Lann-Bihou\u00e9 naval air base of reported in 2014 that ten military aircraft had been targeted by a laser in just nine months.\n   Faced with the resurgence of this type of events against the aircraft of the French Navy stationed on the air bases of Lanv\u00e9oc, Lann Bihou\u00e9 and Landivisiau, the maritime district commander recalls that the trade and possession of lasers are strictly regulated. Thus, owning or using a laser of a class higher than 2 can lead to a sentence of 6 months of imprisonment, with a fine of 7,500 euros. Beyond these criminal penalties, pointing a laser at an aircraft approaching a terrain risks causing serious and irremediable eye injuries to crew members. In the event of complete blindness of the pilots, the risk of an air accident is major.\n   ATL2  French Navy", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:18:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6d77\u519b,navy,\u6fc0\u5149", "title": "\u6cd5\u56fd\u6d77\u519bATL2 MPA\uff1a\u6709\u4eba\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u4e86\u9519\u4e86\u98de\u673a", "title_en": "French Navy ATL2 MPA: Someone Just Lasered The Wrong Aircraft", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/01/french-navy-atl2-mpa-someone-just-lasered-the-wrong-aircraft/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d77\u519b", "navy", "\u6fc0\u5149"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072643, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u591a\u6838OCAML\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "note_en": "Multicore OCaml integration.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 01:08:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "multicore,ocaml", "title": "Ocaml Multicore\u5408\u5e76\u4e0a\u6e38", "title_en": "OCaml Multicore merged upstream", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/commit/001997e81342fd0d321fd877b73608150601e7d9", "via": "", "real_tags": ["multicore", "ocaml"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e5ad684eac6c5c5102d23318e1d71438.jpg", "infoid": 1072641, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53bb\u5e74\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684iCloud\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u65e0\u7f1d\u5730\u4e3a\u6240\u6709iPhone Safari\u6d41\u91cf\u65e0\u7f1d\u8bbe\u7f6e\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684VPN\u6837\u96a7\u9053\u3002\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u76ee\u524d\u4f5c\u4e3aIOS 15\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u7248\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002Apple\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u94fe\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba - \u5305\u62ecApple  - \u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u662f\u8c01\u6216\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5c01\u4fe1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u524a\u51cf\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ece\u8bbf\u95ee\u201c\u91cd\u8981\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5728\u7834\u574f\u6b27\u6d32\u6570\u5b57\u4e3b\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u201c\u91cd\u5927\u540e\u679c\u201d\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u5b83\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u201c\u7ecf\u8425\u8005\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u201d\u3002\n\u9ed8\u8ba4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u7684iOS 15.2\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u4f46Apple\u5df2\u542f\u7528\u5b83\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u7528\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u7559\u4e0bBeta\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\n\u7535\u62a5\u8868\u793a\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e5f\u64ad\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9O2\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6295\u8bc9\u3002\n\u4f01\u4e1a\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528MDM\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7981\u7528\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u3002\n\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  - \u5728\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u7684\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u5730\u6253\u7834\u6709\u5173Apple\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u9875\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Twitter\uff0cFacebook\u548cLinkedIn\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce89to5Mac\u4ee5\u7559\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\uff1f\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u72ec\u5bb6\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0cHow-TOS\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684YouTube\u9891\u9053", "note_en": "One of the major new iCloud features announced last year was Private Relay, which seamlessly sets up an encrypted VPN-like tunnel for all iPhone Safari traffic. Private Relay is currently available as an opt-in beta in iOS 15. Apple says that this feature means that no one in the chain \u2014 including Apple \u2014 knows who you are or what website you are browsing to.\n It seems carriers in Europe don\u2019t like that idea too much.  Via The Telegraph, operators including Vodafone, Telefonica and T-Mobile signed an open letter voicing their opposition to the rollout of the feature. In fact, some carriers are already blocking support as shown in screenshots from readers below.\n  The letter said that Private Relay cuts off networks and servers from accessing \u201cvital network data and metadata\u201d and will have \u201csignificant consequences in terms of undermining European digital sovereignty\u201d. They say it will also impact \u201coperator\u2019s ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks\u201d.\n It\u2019s unclear why the companies are speaking out against Private Relay, when general VPN services have been widely available for years and do much of the same role. Perhaps it is the fact that Private Relay is so easily accessible that they expect a lot of people to use it; the feature is built into iOS 15 and available to any customer with a paid iCloud plan.\n As of the latest shipping release, iOS 15.2, Private Relay is off by default but Apple has signalled that it will be enabled as standard once Private Relay leaves beta testing phase.\n Cynically, Private Relay and other VPN services block the carriers ability to upsell internet features based on your phone plan, like compressing images or restricting HD video streaming to more expensive tiers.\n The Telegraph says mobile carriers in the UK have also aired concerns, including complaints to regulators from O2.\n Availability of Private Relay is already restricted by geography. In compliance with local laws, Apple has already announced that Private Relay will not be offered in China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda and the Philippines.\n Enterprise-managed devices can also choose to disable Private Relay for their employees using MDM profiles.\n Some cellular data plans also appear to already be explicitly denying Private Relay functionality.

Flink ML is a library that provides APIs and infrastructure for buildingstream-batch unified machine learning algorithms, that can be easy-to-use andperformant with (near-) real-time latency.\n This release involves a major refactor of the earlier Flink ML library andintroduces major features that extend the Flink ML API and the iterationruntime, such as supporting stages with multi-input multi-output, graph-basedstage composition, and a new stream-batch unified iteration library. Moreover,we added five algorithm implementations in this release, which is the start ofa long-term initiative to provide a large number of off-the-shelf algorithms inFlink ML with state-of-the-art performance.\n We believe this release is an important step towards extending Apache Flink toa wide range of machine learning use cases, especially the real-time machinelearning scenarios.\n We encourage you to  download the release and share your feedback withthe community through the Flink  mailing lists or JIRA! We hope you like the newrelease and we\u2019d be eager to learn about your experience with it.\n     Stages in a machine learning workflow might take multiple inputs and returnmultiple outputs. For example, a graph embedding algorithm might need to readtwo tables, which represent the edge and node of the graph respectively. And aworkflow might need a stage that splits the input dataset into two outputdatasets, for training and testing respectively.\n With this capability, algorithm developers can assemble a machine learningworkflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of pre-defined stages. And thisworkflow can be configured and deployed without users knowing theimplementation details of this graph. This improvement could considerablyexpand the applicability and usability of Flink ML.\n  In a native online learning scenario, we have a long-running job that keepsprocessing training data and updating a machine learning model. And we couldhave multiple jobs deployed in web servers which do online inference. It isnecessary to transmit the latest model data from the training job to thoseinference jobs in (near-) real-time latency.\n The traditional Estimator/Transformer paradigm does not provide APIs to exposethis model data in a streaming manner. Users have to repeatedly call fit() toupdate model data. Although users might be able to update model data once everyfew minutes, it is likely very inefficient, if not impossible, to update modeldata once every few seconds with this approach.\n With FLIP-173,model data can be exposed as an unbounded stream via the getModelData() API.Then algorithm users can transfer the model data to web servers in real-timeand use the up-to-date model data to do online inference. This feature couldsignificantly strengthen Flink ML\u2019s capability to support online learningapplications.\n  We care a lot about usability and developer velocity in Flink ML. In thisrelease, we refactored and significantly simplified the experience of defining,getting and setting parameters for algorithms.\n With FLIP-174,parameters can be defined as static variables of an interface, and anyalgorithm that implements the interface could inherit these variabledefinitions without additional work. Commonly used parameter validators areprovided as part of the infrastructure.\n  One of the most useful tool in the existing ML libraries (e.g. Scikit-learn,Flink, Spark) is Pipeline,which allows users to compose an estimator from an ordered list of estimatorsand transformers, without having to explicitly implement the fit/transform forthe estimator/transformer.\n FLIP-175extended this capability from pipeline to DAG. Users can now compose anestimator from a DAG of estimator and transformers. This capability ofcomposition allows developers to slice a complex workflow into simpler modulesand re-use the modules across multiple workflows. We believe this capabilitycould significantly improve the experience of building and deploying complexworkflows using Flink ML.\n  To support training machine learning algorithms and adjust the model parametersdynamically based on the prediction result, it is necessary to have nativesupport for processing data iteratively. It is known that Flink uses DAG todescribe the process logic, thus we need to provide the iteration library ontop of Flink separately. Besides, since we need to support both offlinetraining and online training / adjustment, the iteration library should supportboth streaming and batch cases.\n FLIP-176 implements astream-batch unified iteration library. It provides the function oftransmitting records back to the precedent operators and the ability to trackthe progress of rounds inside the iteration. Users could directly useDataStream API and Table API to express the execution logic inside theiteration. Besides, the new iteration library also extends Flink\u2019scheckpointing mechanism to also support exactly-once failover for jobs usingiterations.\n  Nowadays many machine learning practitioners are used to developing machinelearning workflows in Python due to its ease-of-use and excellent ecosystem. Tomeet the needs of these users, a Python package dedicated for Flink ML iscreated starting from this release. The Python package currently provides APIssimilar to their Java counterparts for developing machine learning algorithms.\n   In the future we will enhance the Python SDK to enable its interoperabilitywith Flink ML\u2019s Java library, for example, allowing users to express machinelearning workflows in Python, where workflows consist of a mixture of stagesfrom the Flink ML Java library as well as stages implemented in Python (e.g. aTensorFlow program).\n  Now that the Flink ML API re-design is done, we started the initiative to addoff-the-shelf algorithms in Flink ML. As part of this initiative, we borrowedideas from the  Alink project, and workedclosely with developers of the Alink project to design the new Flink ML APIs,refactor, optimize and migrate algorithms from Alink to Flink. Our long-termgoal is to provide a library of performant algorithms that are easy to use,debug and customize for your needs.\n We have implemented five algorithms in this release, i.e. logistic regression,k-means, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes and one-hot encoder. For now thesealgorithms focus on validating the APIs and iteration runtime. In addition toadding more and more algorithms, we will also stress test and optimize theirperformance to make sure these algorithms have state-of-the-art performance.Stay tuned!\n   To accelerate the development of Flink ML, the effort has moved to the newrepository  flink-ml under the Flinkproject. We here follow a similar approach like the Stateful Functions effort,where a separate repository has helped to speed up the development by allowingfor more light-weight contribution workflows and separate release cycles.\n  To facilitate the community collaboration on ecosystem projects that extend thecapability of the Apache Flink, Apache Flink PMC has granted the permission touse flink-extended as the name of this  GitHuborganization, which provides a neutralplace to host the code of ecosystem projects.\n Two Flink ML related projects have been moved to this organization. dl-on-flink provides thecapability to implement Flink ML stages using TensorFlow. And clink is a library that facilitatesthe implementation of Flink ML stages using C++ in order to support e.g.real-time feature engineering.\n We hope you can join this effort and share your Flink ecosystem projects inthis Github organization. And stay tuned for more updates on ecosystemprojects.\n  Please review this note for a list of adjustments to make and issues to checkif you plan to upgrade to Flink ML 2.0.0.\n This note discusses any critical information about incompatibilities andbreaking changes, performance changes, and any other changes that might impactyour production deployment of Flink ML.\n FLIP-173made major changes to PipelineStage and its subclasses.

The rusting of iron is an example. Reddish iron oxide forms quickly on iron surfaces exposed to atmospheric oxygen, or O2.\n \u201cWhen you expose fresh crystalline surfaces from the sedimentary reservoir to O2, you get weathering that consumes oxygen,\u201d said Yan, a postdoctoral research associate in Rice\u2019s Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.\n Another way glaciers could promote the consumption of atmospheric oxygen is by exposing organic carbon that had been buried for millions of years, Yan said.\n  During Yan\u2019s Ph.D. studies in the labs of  Princeton University\u2019s Michael Bender and John Higgins, Yan worked on a 2016 study led by Daniel Stolper, now an assistant professor at the  University of California, Berkeley, that used  air bubbles in ice cores to show the proportion of oxygen in Earth\u2019s atmosphere had declined by about 0.2% in the past 800,000 years.\n In the Science Advances study, Yan, Higgins and colleagues from Oregon State University, the University of Maine and the University of California, San Diego, analyzed bubbles in older ice cores to show the O2 dip began after the length of Earth\u2019s glacial cycles more than doubled around 1 million years ago.\n The ice age Earth is in today  began about 2.7 million years ago. Dozens of glacial cycles followed. In each, ice caps alternately grew, covering up to a third of the planet, and then retreated toward the poles. Each cycle lasted around 40,000 years until about 1 million years ago. At roughly the same time atmospheric oxygen began to decline, glacial cycles began lasting about 100,000 years.\n \u201cThe reason for the decline is the rate of O2 being produced is lower than the rate of O2 being consumed,\u201d Yan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call the source and the sink. The source is what produces O2, and the sink is what consumes or drags on O2. In the study, we interpret the decline to be a stronger drag on O2, meaning more is being consumed.\u201d\n  Yan said Earth\u2019s biosphere didn\u2019t contribute to the decline because it is balanced, drawing as much O2 from the atmosphere as it produces. Weathering, on a global scale, is the most likely geological process capable of consuming enough excess O2 to account for the decline, and Yan and colleagues considered two scenarios for increased weathering.\n Global sea level falls when glaciers are advancing and rises when they retreat. When the length of glacial cycles more than doubled, so did the magnitude of swings in sea level. As coastlines advanced, land previously covered by water would have been exposed to the oxidizing power of atmospheric O2.\n \u201cWe did some calculations to see how much oxygen that might consume and found it could only account for about a quarter of the observed decrease,\u201d Yan said.\n Because the extent of ice coverage isn\u2019t precisely known for each glacial cycle, there\u2019s a wider range of uncertainty about the magnitude of chemical weathering from glacial erosion. But Yan said the evidence suggests it could draw enough oxygen to account for the decline.\n \u201cOn a global scale, it\u2019s very hard to pinpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we did some tests about how much additional weathering would be needed to account for the O2 decline, and it\u2019s not unreasonable. Theoretically, it could account for the magnitude of what\u2019s been observed.\u201d\n Reference: \u201cIce core evidence for atmospheric oxygen decline since the Mid-Pleistocene transition\u201d by Yuzhen Yan, Edward J.

The move comes after the Japanese government made official recommendations to private employers in 2021 that included a shorter workweek.\n  The four-day workweek has been floated around the world in various forms from Finland to New Zealand. Sometimes, the shorter weeks just mean that employers make the four days of work longer, while maintaining something close to 40 hours. Other times the companies will actually be offering a shorter week with fewer total hours, so that people can pursue more leisure time or more education.\n \u201cWe must support the well-being of our employees,\u201d President and CEO Yuki Kusumi recently said, according to Nikkei.\n      Panasonic hopes to give workers more time to pursue their personal interests, whether volunteering or a side job. Details will be ironed out by each operating company.\n Just 8% of Japanese companies offered more than two guaranteed days off a week in a 2020 survey by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Those that do are usually looking to help workers meet the demands of their personal lives, like Yahoo Japan and Sompo Himawari Life Insurance, which began offering a third day off in 2017 only to those caring for children or aging relatives.\n   Companies that have trialed a shorter work week, while maintaining competitive pay have generally found no loss of productivity. In fact, tech companies have found that slashing hours often leads to high productivity, not to mention more satisfaction among the workforce. When Microsoft in Japan tried out a four-day workweek in 2019, productivity shot up 40%, according to the   Washington Post.\n Despite having a reputation in the U.S. as a workaholic culture, Japanese workers actually work fewer hours than their American counterparts, according to the most recent data from the   Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The U.S. ranked 11th for most hours worked by the average worker among OECD countries, while Japan ranked 26th. The top five, in order, included: Colombia, Mexico, Costa Rica, South Korea, and Russia.\n  Americans have been promised a shorter work week for generations. In fact, economic experts of the 1960s were certain we\u2019d be working just 16-hour workweeks by now, with robots doing the majority of the work. Your only problem was going to be what to do with all your leisure time.\n An article that ran in a North Carolina newspaper on   November 26, 1967 promised it all:\n Those who hunger for time off from work may take heart from the forecast of political scientist Sebastian de Grazia that the average work week, by the year 2000, will average 31 hours, and perhaps as few as 21. Twenty years later, on-the-job hours may have dwindled to 26, or even 16.\n But what will people do with all that free time? The outlook may not be cheery.\n As De Grazia sees it: \u201cThere is reason to fear, as some do, that free time, forced free time, will bring on the restless tick of boredom, idleness, immorality, and increased personal violence. If the cause is identified as automation and the preference for higher intelligence, nonautomated jobs may increase, but they will carry the stigma of stupidity. Men will prefer not to work rather than to accept them. Those who do accept will increasingly come to be a politically inferior class.\u201d\n One possible solution: a separation of income from work; perhaps a guaranteed annual wage to provide \u201cthe wherewithal for a life of leisure for all those who think they have the temperament.\u201d\n  Where did all of that leisure time go? Your boss used it to buy his second home.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 23:58:44", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u65e5\u672c,offer", "title": "Panasonic\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u56db\u5929\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5468|\u5f53\u5de5\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5177\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5347\u8d77\u3002", "title_en": "Panasonic to Offer Four-Day Workweek in Japan | Productivity actually goes up when workers have more flexibility with their hours.", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/panasonic-to-offer-four-day-workweek-in-japan-1848330311", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e5\u672c", "offer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a41402654c3f6e7a7d90e1275c544252.jpg", "infoid": 1072635, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "RobertoCebri\u00e1n\u548cDavid Villarraal\u90fd\u6709\u4e0e\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u7684\u9910\u5385\u4e00\u8d77\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u8bb8\u591a\u9910\u9986\u6ca1\u6709\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u8fc5\u901f\u6539\u53d8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002\n\u968f\u7740\u9006\u8f6c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e8e2020\u5e744\u6708\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u8499\u7279\u96f7\u7684\u9e66\u9e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e2021\u5e74\u7531ParrotConnect\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e3a\u9910\u5385\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5bb6\u5ead\u9001\u8d27\u70ed\u6f6e\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3002\n\u76f8\u53cd\uff0cParrotConnect\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f9b\u5e94\u9910\u5385\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u788e\u7247\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8868\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba2\u5355 - \u8fdb\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ba1\u7406\u95e8\u6237\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u83dc\u5355\uff0c\u53a8\u623f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\u661f\u671f\u4e00\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\u5176\u62c5\u4fdd\u4e86950\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7531\u4e3b\u8981\u8d44\u91d1\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u5f00\u53d1\u5e15\u91cc\u7279\u5eb7\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u7684\u8db3\u8ff9\u3002\u65b0\u8d44\u672c\u4e3a\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e861170\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\n\u9e66\u9e49\u57282021\u5e741\u6708\u5236\u9020\u8f6f\u53d1\u5c04\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u76d6\u7279\u73b0\u5728\u4e0e500\u591a\u5bb6\u9910\u5385 - \u585e\u4f2f\u6069\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u9910\u5385 - \u6240\u6709\u7684\u9910\u5385 - \u6240\u6709\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u987e\u5ba2\u3002\u5b83\u76ee\u524d\u57282021\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u670960\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c10\u540d\u5458\u5de5\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u76f4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u9910\u9986\u7684\u6210\u957f\uff0cCebri\u00e1n\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63ed\u9732\u6536\u5165\u6570\u636e\u592a\u65e9\u3002 ParrotConnect\u8ba1\u5212\u4e3a\u6bcf\u670873\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4e3a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aPOS\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "Roberto Cebri\u00e1n and David Villarreal both had experience working with restaurants in Mexico and recognized that many restaurants were not prepared to change their operations quickly, so they jumped on the opportunity to help them.\n \u201cThere are a bunch of food tech solutions in Latin American and U.S., but it ended up turning the operations in both the front and back of the house into a mess,\u201d Cebri\u00e1n said. \u201cThe pandemic was a crazy experience. Not a lot of people knew what would happen, but the downside was that restaurants closed.\u201d\n   With an eye on reversing that trend, they created Monterrey-based  Parrot in April 2020, and in 2021 launched with ParrotConnect, its point-of-sale software for restaurants enabling them to digitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth.\n Cebri\u00e1n told TechCrunch that many restaurants were balancing an average of three delivery apps and 15 different menus at each location. Often connectivity issues and menu errors caused restaurants to get anywhere from 10% to 15% of the orders wrong or late when they were pushed from the apps to the restaurant\u2019s point-of-sale software so that they could be made.\n Instead, ParrotConnect offers a way for restaurants to centralize all of those fragmented operations, including table service and online orders \u2014 into one management portal where users can operate functions like menus, kitchen management, payment methods and reports.\n  The company is working with over 60 collaborators on the product and now has more than 500 restaurants across Monterrey, Mexico City and the Riviera Maya using ParrotConnect.\n On Monday, the company announced it secured $9.5 million, led by F Prime Capital, to continue developing ParrotConnect and expand its footprint in Mexico. The new capital gives the company a total of $11.7 million in funding.\n Parrot is the latest company raising capital as part of a broader trend of companies helping restaurants thrive in this new digital world, including  Zak, also developing point-of-sale technology for restaurants, payment system  Sunday and restaurant management software company  MarginEdge.\n Since making a soft launch in January 2021, Parrot is now working with over 500 restaurants \u2014 all paying customers, Cebri\u00e1n said. It has 60 employees currently after starting in 2021 with 10 employees. The company has been focused on helping restaurants grow, and Cebri\u00e1n said it was too early to disclose revenue figures.

If you choose \u201cAssertive,\u201d the notes state that \u201cin this profile, your Model X will have a smaller follow distance, perform more frequent speed lane changes, will not exit passing lanes and may perform rolling stops.\u201d As  @Digitalhen notes, the system may also perform rolling stops even in \u201cAverage\u201d mode.\n  Generally, a rolling stop means a vehicle doesn\u2019t come to a complete halt at a stop sign (which is illegal and  dangerous) but it\u2019s not yet clear if that\u2019s what FSD will do. It\u2019s also  illegal in many states to stay in the left or passing lane if you\u2019re not passing anyone, and of course, it\u2019s never a great idea to follow the vehicle ahead too closely. All of that said, the mode hasn\u2019t been tested enough yet to demonstrate exactly how it\u2019s doing those things.\n On the weekend, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla would be  raising the price of FSD from $10,000 to $12,000, even though it\u2019s still in beta.
