He was formerly an operating partner at Mercato Growth Partners and served as CEO and chairman of PublicEngines (acquired by Motorola), and Avinti (merged with M86 Security) and served as chief marketing officer/chief strategy officer of M86 Security (acquired by Trustwave).\n  McKinsey  found that the value of co-investment deals has more than doubled to $104 billion from 2012 to 2018. And by some counts, there are as many as  1,600 \u201cnontraditional\u201d investors helping to fund venture capital deals in 2021.\n The primary motivator for nontraditional investors is seeking better returns, and investing alongside VC funds is a great way to achieve that. A recent  Preqin study shows co-investing funds significantly outperform traditional funds.\n Research shows that 80% of investors found their co-investments outperforming private equity fund investments, with 46% outperforming by a margin of more than 5%. Investors also benefit from a generally less expensive fee structure compared to traditional private equity or VC funds.\n  Co-investors can also profit by sharing the investment risk, which benefits all investors and builds loyalty and trust. And because this kind of investing requires a hands-on approach, investors get the chance to work closely with top sponsors \u2014 the general partners (GPs) \u2014 to foster deeper relationships and gain a better understanding of the GPs\u2019 investment strategies and deal review processes. For new investors, building these relationships is essential for strengthening their own investment skills in the long run.\n  Alternative investors aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from co-investing, it\u2019s also a boon for GPs. They gain a broader array of funding options by partnering with alternative investors, and they can leverage their own capital more effectively with prospective investments.\n VCs have other benefits too: While co-investing LPs remain passive in the business, the VC can use that voting power to preserve investor rights and consolidate decision-making. It also allows them to put more money to work in any company while staying within diversification limits.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 03:37:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528,investing,\u6295\u8d44", "title": "VCS\u5982\u4f55\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528LPS\u4e0eLPS\u5171\u540c\u6295\u8d44 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow VCs can get the most out of co-investing alongside LPs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/how-vcs-can-get-the-most-out-of-co-investing-alongside-lps/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528", "investing", "\u6295\u8d44"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eea3e3f18884f89dd891eb99726c91da.jpg", "infoid": 1068715, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6765\u81eaFacebook\u7684\u5355\u72ec\u5e73\u53f0\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86BulletIn  - \u5728\u5176\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7b54\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u201c\u4f7f\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56Facebook\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d1\u5c55\u89c2\u4f17\u3002\u201d\u60a8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981Facebook\u5e10\u6237\u6765\u8ba2\u9605\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u544a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eFacebook\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528Facebook\u652f\u4ed8\u8d2d\u4e70\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8ba2\u9605\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u4ec5\u9650\u7528\u6237\u7ec4\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u97f3\u9891\u5ba4\u3002\n \u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u559c\u6b22\u65f6\u5c1a\u91c7\u53d6\u201c\u8131\u79bb\u201d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728Facebook\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f5c\u5bb6\u90fd\u88ab\u6311\u9009\u4e3a\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u98df\u8089\u4ecd\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u5bb6\u55bb\u6237\u53e3\u8ba1\u5212\u6765\u8865\u8d34\u9632\u8de8\u4fee\u8f9e\uff0c\u8be5\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u59d4\u6258\u7279\u5b9a\u4f5c\u5bb6\u5728\u5bb6\u4e2d\u5199\u4f5c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u4e25\u91cd\u7b56\u5212\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u56f0\u6270\u56f0\u6270\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0d\u4f1a\u514d\u75ab\u3002\n  \u516c\u544a\u4e0a\u7684\u4f5c\u5bb6\u521d\u59cb\u677f\u5ca9\u5305\u62ecMalcom Grortwell\uff0cMitch Abom\uff0cEri\u200b\u200bn Andrews\u548cTan France  - \u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7b54\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5176Beta\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ee5\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u6709\u4e24\u540d\u56fd\u9645\u4f5c\u5bb6\uff08\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u56fd\u9645\u4f5c\u5bb6\u56fd\u9645\u521b\u9020\u8005\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684Beta\u8ba1\u5212\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\uff0c\u201cBulletin\u8bf4\u3002\uff09Facebook\u6b63\u5728\u5411\u5176\u4f5c\u5bb6\u652f\u4ed8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u8ba1\u5212\u524a\u51cf\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f5c\u5bb6\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u95ed\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u5217\u8868\u3002 ", "note_en": "Bulletin is built on a separate platform from Facebook \u2014 on its  website, the FAQ states that this is to \u201cenable creators to grow their audience in ways that are not exclusively dependent on the Facebook platform.\u201d You don\u2019t need a Facebook account to subscribe to a newsletter, but Bulletin relies on Facebook\u2019s infrastructure, including the use of Facebook Pay to purchase premium subscriptions and join subscriber-only groups and live audio rooms.\n Competitors like Substack take a \u201c hands-off\u201d approach to content moderation, allowing anyone to start a newsletter.

", "note_en": "Intel has delayed production of its next-generation Xeon Scalable CPUs, code-named Sapphire Rapids, to the first quarter of 2022 and said it will start ramping shipments by at least April of next year.\n The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company disclosed the delay in a Tuesday blog post by Lisa Spelman, head of Intel\u2019s Xeon and Memory Group, who teased the CPU\u2019s new microarchitecture as well as two features that will be new to the Xeon lineup: the next generation of Deep Learning Boost and an acceleration engine called Intel Data Streaming Accelerator.\n  Spelman said Intel is delaying Sapphire Rapids, the 10-nanometer successor to the recently launched  Ice Lake server processors, because of extra time needed to validate the CPU.\n \u201cGiven the breadth of enhancements in Sapphire Rapids, we are incorporating additional validation time prior to the production release, which will streamline the deployment process for our customers and partners. Based on this, we now expect Sapphire Rapids to be in production in the first quarter of 2022, with ramp beginning in the second quarter of 2022,\u201d Spelman wrote.\n In multiple\u00a0 statements last year, Intel said it was aiming to start shipping Sapphire Rapids in 2021, but the goalposts started to move in recent months, with new CEO Pat Gelsinger saying in March that Intel was aiming for the CPU to enter production \u201caround the end of the year.\u201d In Intel\u2019s Computex 2021 keynote at the beginning of this month, Spelman said Sapphire Rapids was set for a 2022 launch.\n It\u2019s not clear how much of a setback the production delay is, but Intel\u2019s processors using next-generation manufacturing processes like 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer have faced multiple delays over the years, which has given an extra edge to rival AMD and companies developing Arm-based CPUs. That has helped AMD  grow its x86 CPU share in the server market to 8.9 percent. AMD has also quadrupled its share of the top 500 supercomputers in the world in a matter of one year.\n The delays are a major reason why Gelsinger, who became CEO in February, has made execution a  top priority for the company as he works to bring the company back to \u201cunquestioned leadership.\u201d\n \u201cCustomers must be able to rely on Intel for their products and their strategies for the future,\u201d he said in a letter to employees in February. \u201cWhile we must set aggressive targets to regain share and leadership, they must also be achievable and done with the highest quality.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-30 03:29:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u82f1\u7279\u5c14,\u5ef6\u8fdf,delays", "title": "\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u84dd\u5b9d\u77f3\u6025\u6d41Xeon CPU\u751f\u4ea7\u5230Q1 2022 ", "title_en": "Intel Delays Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPU Production To Q1 2022", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/intel-delays-sapphire-rapids-xeon-cpu-production-to-q1-2022", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f1\u7279\u5c14", "\u5ef6\u8fdf", "delays"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e14e3eefdde2c2cf58d7b88825a4f49d.png", "infoid": 1068713, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8bf4\u4f60\u7528\u8138\u90e8\u53d1\u51fa\u5f69\u7968\u7968......  \u8d62\u5f971/1000\u7684\u83b7\u80dc\u673a\u4f1a\u7684\u9884\u671f\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7f8e\u5206\u3002 \u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5  \u4ed8\u6b3e\uff1a\u94f6\u884c\u53d1\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u786c\u5e01\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u518d\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u5b83  \u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80dc\u5229\u8005\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u81f4\u7535\u6536\u4ef6\u4eba\uff06\uff0334;\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

U.S. inflation has averaged 3% in the past 100 years, 2% in the 2010s, and 1% in 2020, but it has been annualising at 8% so far in 2021, Bofa said in the note.\n Global stocks were holding near record highs hours ahead of the reading of May core personal consumption expenditures index, an inflation gauge tracked closely by the Fed. The gauge is estimated to rise 3.4% year-on-year.\n U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell vowed on Tuesday not to raise interest rates too quickly based only on the fear of coming inflation. The comments were seen as a move to soothe investor nerves after a hawkish monetary policy meeting last week suggested officials believed interest rates would rise as soon as 2023, perhaps a year earlier than anticipated.\n BofA clients were still heavily invested in equities, with cash allocations well below long-term averages at 11.2%.\n In the week to Wednesday, investors pumped $7 billion into equities and $9.9 billion into bond funds, while pulling $53.5 billion from cash funds, BofA calculated, using EPFR data.\n Within equities, emerging market funds saw outflows of $1.6 billion - the largest since September 2020.\n As the first half of 2021 is drawing to close, Hartnett said higher inflation, hawkish central banks and weaker growth are the key themes to watch out for in the second half.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 03:27:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u901a\u80c0,remain,\u80a1\u7968", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u901a\u80c0\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u8fbe\u56db\u5e74 -  BOFA ", "title_en": "U.S. inflation likely to remain elevated for up to four years \u2013 BofA", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/global-markets-bofa-urgent-2021-06-25/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u901a\u80c0", "remain", "\u80a1\u7968"]}]
