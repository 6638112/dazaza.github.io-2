There was a time and a place for me to play the punditry game with Apple, but I feel like that was years ago in a much different time and place. I spent 17 years at Apple, and boy, do I have opinions about the place, both how it was and how it is, but I also sometimes remind myself it was almost that long ago that I left, and things change. I changed.\u00a0  Does the world need one more Apple pundit? God, no, there are so many people with so many opinions I mostly sit on the sidelines and don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the time to try to get heard above the noisy of the mob that circles around Apple with their endless hot takes. (To answer a question I get every so often: the way I stay up to date on Apple these days is I pay attention to what Jason and Dan write at  Sixcolors.com, and what Jason and Myke talk about on the  Upgrade podcast. They connect me to basically everything I feel I should know about with Apple, and give me good, thoughtful opinions about the things they discuss and point to.\u00a0  I am still very much embedded in that ecosystem, and I have never seriously considered doing anything else, and I at this point never expect to. I depended on my iPhone even when I was working and evangelizing a phone that wanted to pretend it was competing with Apple (but honestly, we never really did). That doesn&#39;t mean I love, or even like, everything Apple does. But mostly I think Apple is doing good things, most of the time.\u00a0   The Apple Silicon Transition  One thing I think Apple is doing very well: the transition to Apple Silicon (aka the ARM chips). I replaced my fairly recent Apple 16&#34; Macbook Pro with the M1 Macbook Air, and it works wonderfully well. As someone who lived through the 68K -&gt; PowerPC transition, was leaving Apple in the early days of the PowerPC -&gt; Intel transition, and for good measure had to survive the Classic MacOS -&gt; MacOSX transition, I&#39;ve seen this floorshow before. Apple is knocking this one out of the park.\u00a0  In day to day use, the M1 laptop blows away the 16&#34; pro -- which I loved and which Laurie now has and uses. There are a few places where it&#39;s consumer designs appear, and the one way I can systematically drag it down to a crawl is by telling Lightroom to do multiple compute intensive things at once: for instance, a common operation for me is to import a bunch of photos, then set up Lightroom to convert them all to DNG, and build 1:1 and Smart profiles for each. The 16&#34; handles this load fine; the M1 slogs and struggles, because Adobe makes no attempt to recognize overload conditions and self-throttle. If I do them serially, all is fine, but multiple, independent compute intensive threads can kick the computer in the kneepcap.\u00a0  This doesn&#39;t bother me, because I expected it and it&#39;s avoidable with some thought (one might wish Adobe would make their background processing smarter, but, well, it&#39;s Adobe). And it&#39;s a great example of the difference between the higher end Intel chips in the Macbook pro, and the M1 Macbook air: the M1 is way better at 99% of what I use it for, but it has its limitations -- limitations which were obvious and expected, and limitations which will be removed when Apple brings out newer, more powerful chips.\u00a0  This is a place where I think many of the so-called pundits fell down in their discussions about Apple; they look at the M1 and complain about its limits, not seeming to understand this isn&#39;t the best Apple can do, it&#39;s the first that Apple did. The M1 is \u00a0a great entry level chip for good entry level systems, and a strong indication of what&#39;s possible in this new Apple Silicon era as Apple improves and matures its chips. If you follow a pundit that couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t see this basic idea, you really need to upgrade your pundits.\u00a0  So far, the software translation that allows Intel software to work has, well, just worked. It&#39;s been flawless. Way better than the first generation of Rosetta tools we lived with in previous transitions.  My plan, in fact, is when the rumored 30&#34; iMacs come out, with hopefully a more pro-sumer capable CPU (M1x or M2?) I&#39;ll be adding one to the clan and make that my primary computer, with my laptop going back to pure mobile use. We&#39;ll probably replace Laurie&#39;s iMac, also, and then at some point I&#39;ll likely upgrade back to a Macbook Pro and she&#39;ll get this M1 Air.\u00a0   Other Products  I love my iPhone, although once again, my &#34;plan&#34; to get serious about using it for photography has fallen victim to this &#34;I have no time to spare to invest in learning this&#34; thing. I like my iPad, but it is very much a consumption device for me, so I&#39;m not demanding more of it than it&#39;s able to offer me, and I fully agree with and support the people who complain about how much more limited the OS is than the hardware could potentially offer. I wonder why they put an M1 in an iPad, when to me, all it does is highlight how much less an iPad can do than my M1 Macbook can -- although there are various aspects of how I use an iPad where I much prefer it to my Mac. But the iPad is still trying to figure out how to be a mature platform, and in many ways, falling short. I also note I haven&#39;t touched my Apple Pencil since about a month after I bought it with my latest iPad model -- it just doesn&#39;t sync into how I work with the device.\u00a0  Yet. (see: &#34;this year, I&#39;m going to get serious about using iPhones in my photography&#34;)  I love my Apple Watch. First thing I do -- before getting out of bed in the morning -- is put it on. Last thing I do, as I sit on the edge of the bed, is take it off so it can charge. I struggle to find a watch face I love, but I have some I like, and that&#39;s more than good enough for someone like me. Rene Ritchie once said that the Apple Sports Band was the yoga pants of watchbands, and well, yes, I wear my watch with one of those bands 100% of the time, because it&#39;s nice and comfortable and that&#39;s what I want. Fashionista I am not, nor do I ever want to be...  Other Apple Hardware is less successful for me. I own a Homepod, and mostly, I forget it&#39;s there and I forget to tell my devices to send audio to it. If it were to fail, I wouldn&#39;t replace it. I was for a long time a big supporter of the Apple TV, but when the one in my office failed, I replaced it with a Roku. the only reason we still have an Apple TV in the house is because it hasn&#39;t failed yet, and we frankly never use it any more. Apple took this product down the wrong paths, and it&#39;s become irrelevant as far as I&#39;m concerned. And Earpods -- I just bought a new pair when my older pair finally became somewhere beyond unreliable and trending into broken. For the last couple of months, I&#39;ve been kind of down on them, but with a new pair that is working properly, I&#39;m a lot happier with them now. I did, in fact, buy a replacement pair, but I don&#39;t make them my only/default hearing device; I still prefer my Bose QC35&#39;s when I&#39;m in my office, and I use the earpods for phone calls and when I&#39;m mobile. I don&#39;t love wearing the earpods for multiple hours at a time, but that&#39;s probably my biggest complaint about them.  If I were to assign letter grades, how about these: Apple Silicon Macs A, Intel Macs B, iPads: B-, the iPhone a B+, Homepod gets a boring C, Apple TV gets a D, and Earpods get a B-. Overall, not bad results for Apple.   Software  When it comes to Apple&#39;s software, though, I have some bigger gripes. One of the big draws of App&#39;e&#39;s infrastructure is how apps can integrate and move data around between sets of related apps. Given that idea, though, why is it I feel like I&#39;m always looking for a better third party app than the standard Apple one? I&#39;m talking about apps like Mail, like Calendar and the Contacts app specifically.\u00a0  I currently use Spark as my mail client. It&#39;s been -- fine -- but I&#39;m about to shift back to the app I used before I was tired of it&#39;s glitches and moved to Spark, which is Airmail. I&#39;m shifting away from Spark because I&#39;m tired of its glitches and want to see if Airmail is less glitchy now. I&#39;m betting -- not. But still, I keep hoping.\u00a0  Apple Mail? I really want to like it. I don&#39;t dislike it, actually, and every so often I use it for a while, but it&#39;s missing some key features (like snooze) I&#39;d like to have, and it feels -- fine. It&#39;s a fine app that is also more or less forgettable.\u00a0  How to define how I feel about the Mail app? Remember back in high school or college that cute person you worked up the the nerve to ask out on a date, and they spent the entire evening looking disinterested and killing any attempt at conversation with one or two word answers and silences? That&#39;s Apple Mail to me; they&#39;re a nice person and all, but... there&#39;s nothing I feel like building a relationship around. I&#39;ve tried it enough times to know I don&#39;t want to try again unless Apple does something that really convinces me they&#39;ve spent time understanding what a modern mail app should be. I&#39;m not holding my breath. For a calendar I use  Fantastical, and love it and pay for it willingly. For contacts? Allow me to exhale a deep, loud sigh. I&#39;ve been using Busycontacts for a while, and it&#39;s -- it&#39;s fine, just like Apple Mail is fine. And the Fantastical people just bundled Cardhop with Fantastical, so I&#39;ve been working with it for the last week, and it&#39;s actually a pretty good app, but it works in ways I don&#39;t like, where I can honestly say &#34;it&#39;s not you it&#39;s me&#34;, so I&#39;ve uninstalled it again (for the third time). And since I can be equally uninspired by both Apple&#39;s Contacts app and Busycontacts, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go back to Apple&#39;s Contacts app again. (edit later: or more correctly, I tried for about an hour, and I&#39;m back with Busycontacts because there were just too many issues with the contacts app) For a while. Until I meet some new contacts app and take it out for a spin, hoping it&#39;ll actually do what I&#39;d like a Contacts app will do.\u00a0  These apps are a good example of an ongoing problem I think Apple hasn&#39;t taken seriously enough: they commit resources to build something and they promote that thing with marketing and keynotes and all of the hype -- and then many of those things get stuffed in a closet and mostly ignored year after year as the market moves forward and innovates. Apple Mail is a great example of a really good email app if it was ten years ago, and remember Apple&#39;s Airport wifi devices? Apple&#39;s long neglect of them is why I&#39;m a pretty happy user of Eero these days.\u00a0  But in the case of something like a mail app, Apple giving a basic app away for free inhibits other developers from tackling that idea, and limits their ability to make enough money to warrant doing the hard investment in doing a real killer version of an app of that type. I do wish Apple would choose to either commit hard to an app and make it best of show, or kill the app and open the market to other companies. Instead, they do a middle policy of doing minimal work on an adequate app, making it harder for non-Apple apps to thrive, but not really serving the needs of the users very well, either.\u00a0  Itunes -- oh, sorry, Apple Music -- is another app like this. A number of years ago I wrote a piece that described it as a dumpster fire. Now? It feels like a dumpster fire where Apple closed one half of the dumpster lids, declared victory and went off to design even more interesting iPhones instead.\u00a0  Apple, I think, has too many things they&#39;ve built and committed to market and not enough resources committed to properly maintain and push them forward. Whether it&#39;s the Apple Airports or the Apple TV, which I think Tim Cook should just retire and embrace the Apple TV software on other devices -- or software like Mail that goes years without any significant innovation -- there are parts of Apple&#39;s ecosystem that seem to go on idle for years at a time, and where Apple simply doesn&#39;t care enough or have enough resources to commit to doing those bits and pieces justice. And because of it, its users are not as well served as Apple users deserve to be.\u00a0  A side aspect of this &#34;benign neglect?&#34; thing I see is that software quality at Apple, which for years was rock solid, has become more hit and miss. I do believe Apple has figured this out and I do believe they&#39;re working on it -- but I also believe the results have been spotty. I&#39;m one of those people who still install updates when tehy&#39;re released -- for the most part, and maybe a few hours after the real early adopters have had a chance to bleed their edges first -- but I&#39;ve become more and more hesitant about that in the last few years. I should trust Apple&#39;s software quality, and for a long time I did, but now? I hesitate more, because I&#39;ve hit too many rough edges.\u00a0   The Podcast App and Paid Podcasts  Recently, Apple made a lot of noise about Podcasts and the Podcasts app. And you know what? If you look up &#34;adequate app&#34; in the dictionary, the Podcast app logo will be \u00a0there, because that&#39;s exactly what that app is. So since Apple seems to be getting serious about podcasts (finally), did they invest in making the podcast app great?\u00a0  No. They created a system of paid podcasts, which can be listened to only in their podcast app. They didn&#39;t innovate to an app you want to use, they built a service that tries to force you to use it. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good for those podcasters who choose to sign up for that service, and I don&#39;t expect that service to thrive or ever be a major player in podcasts -- and I don&#39;t think Apple has done its users any favors by playing this exclusive content game.\u00a0  It&#39;s an example of a bad trend I see out of Apple, a refusal to embrace and compete in existing market areas, but instead trying to use their existing ecosystem to force people into exclusive relationships with Apple. Almost as if they don&#39;t feel they can compete and win, so instead they attempt use their 800 pound gorilla status in some area to force us into doing it their way in others. And often, this blows up in their face, and it may be blowing up in their face big time right now, but we&#39;ll get to that shortly.\u00a0  It&#39;s an indication of an attitudinal shift in Apple I don&#39;t like: it&#39;s one thing to believe it can and should be the dominate player in a market, and when you turn out dominant products like the iPhone, you deserve to be. But increasingly, it seems Apple is shifting from &#34;we can be the biggest player in this market&#34; to &#34;we don&#39;t believe we should have any competitors in this market&#34;. And that trend really worries me and makes me less supportive of Apple in general.\u00a0   The App Store and Apple&#39;s developers  A bit of background seems to be in order. I went to work at Apple to help found a team known as the Direct Response Center. It&#39;s purpose was to act as paid tech support for the &#34;complex&#34; Apple products where &#34;call your dealer&#34; was Apple&#39;s support policy. That included initially Apple&#39;s A/UX Unix product, and later various other things as well. You&#39;ve likely never heard of A/UX, because this was the 68K era of Apple products and possibly before you were born, but that organization grew up, ultimately moved to Austin (without me) and you probably have heard the name of the organization it became, which is Applecare. Over the years, especially after I shifted over to IS&amp;T and became fully involved in building and running email things for Apple, I was involved in many parts of Apple in one way or another.\u00a0  After leaving Apple, I shifted into roles that were various parts of Community Management for outside developers and acting as the Developer Advocate within the company for those outside developers. Two of the companies I did this for were Palm (for the WebOS reboot attempt) and Cisco (when Susie Wee founded their Devnet team, which unlike Palm, has grown and succeeded wildly).\u00a0  At Palm I was involved in the launch of the app store and the developer programs, and I really came to learn and love the challenges of that role. I also really came to believe -- and argue for -- strong support for the independent developers, not just for the big development houses, because I believe that&#39;s where the new developers mature out of that go on to big things, and that&#39;s where the true innovation on a platform happens.\u00a0  Palm was a disaster on many levels and deserved to fail, but the core intentions were good and the plans we tried to implement were worth fighting for. I had always had a belief that the indie developers were vital to any platform, but Palm and working with them on a daily basis and arguing their cases inside the company helped me crystalize that belief -- the indie developer is the lifeblood of an active and innovative development ecosystem, and deserves to be encouraged and nurtured. It may not be an investment that pays off today, but those developers will go on to lead and push forward those bigger teams, and do so as external evangelists for your products and platforms.\u00a0  As part of my work at Palm, I was part of the team that launched that App store, and actually ran the store during beta before we hired the real App Store team, which, of course, included people we hired from Apple.\u00a0   Apple doesn&#39;t value its developers  So when I talk about App Stores and developer programs and how developers should be treated, I point all this out to show that it&#39;s not exactly theoretical for me, it&#39;s personal. I&#39;ve lived that life, fought those wars (and at Palm, more or less lost at every opportunity, but that&#39;s a sad story for another time). And to a degree, it&#39;s why I&#39;ve always hesitated talking about Apple and their developer programs and App Store.\u00a0  Because to me, Apple does an absolute crap job of taking care of their developers. The defining word that comes to mind to me is -- arrogance. An expectation that the developers need Apple, so Apple doesn&#39;t have to reciprocate.\u00a0  And... With the IOS App store, Apple is absolutely correct. Developers need to be on IOS. It&#39;s far less true on MacOS, and if you&#39;ve ever taken a look at the Apple TV App Store, you can easily see how ludicrously poorly that platform is considered by developers.\u00a0  Apple has never been that interested or great at relationships with developers, and I say that with great respect for many members of Apple&#39;s DTS/Devrel teams, some of whom are friends and who have spent years fighting the good fight internally as well.  It&#39;s gotten worse over the years, and while I will cut Apple some slack -- I don&#39;t think people remotely understand the complexity and difficulty of doing things at the scale Apple has to do them -- but where Apple has over the years had opportunities to improve things for developers and make these platforms more appealing, they have consistently chosen to not take those opportunities. There&#39;s zero reason the App Store cut is still 30%, other than Apple believing it can get away with it.\u00a0  I won&#39;t complain about Apple cutting deals with big companies others can&#39;t get -- I&#39;m thinking Amazon&#39;s 15% cut, for one -- because, well, that&#39;s how business operates and honestly, should. But Apple could have shown some love to the smaller devs as well, and didn&#39;t.

The issue persists after rebooting the device (although a workaround does exist, see below).\n Although Schuo does not detail exactly how he figured this out, any programmer should notice a pattern in the funky network name required to trigger the bug.\n Here\u2019s the likely explanation: the \u2018%[character]\u2019 syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the \u2018%n\u2019 specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.\n Obviously, this is such an obscure chain of events that it is highly unlikely that any person accidentally falls into this, unless a load of Wi-Fi pranksters suddenly pop up in the wild with open Wi-Fi networks using the poisoned name. Until Apple fixes this edge case in a future OS update, just keep an eye out for any Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their name.\n Nevertheless, If you  are somehow affected by this, the bug does not appear to permanently damage your hardware.\n You should be able to reset all network settings and start over. In Settings, go to General -&gt; Reset -&gt; Reset Network Settings. This resets all saved Wi-Fi networks on the iPhone (as well as other things like cellular settings and VPN access), thereby removing the knowledge of the malicious network name from its memory. You can then join your standard home Wi-Fi once more.\n After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID \u201c%p%s%s%s%s%n\u201d, my iPhone permanently disabled it\u2019s WiFi functionality.

In my use case, I am happy sacrificing e.g. 0.5GB and kill runaway tasks  before the system freezes. Potentially OOM killer would also work better in such conditions. I almost never work at close to full memory capacity, it&#39;s always a single task that goes wrong and brings the system down.\n     No caches means all executable pages, ro pages (e.g. fonts) are evictedfrom memory and have to be constantly reloaded on every user action.\n It is indeed a difficult problem - somecached pages (streaming IO) will likely not be needed again and shouldbe discarded asap, other (like mmapped executable/ro pages of UIutilities) will cause thrashing when evicted under high memory pressure.\n  I would like to try disabling/limiting eviction of some/allfile pages (for example exec pages) akin to disabling swapping, butthere is no such mechanism. Yes, there would likely be problems withlarge RO mmapped files that would need to be addressed, but in manyapplications users would be interested in having such options.\n  Once swap runs out, the kernel stops having a choice. It can only make room by reclaiming important caches. And this will turn bad quickly, as it will eventually include the executables/libraries that must be loaded as they are doing work!\n So, we don&#39;t want to get the kernel into the situation where it must remove executables/libraries from main memory. If that happens, you can end up hitting the disk for  every function call.\n      On this video: running fast memory hogs in a loop on Debian 10 GNOME, 4 GiB MemTotal without swap space.\n prelockd enabled: about 500 MiB mlocked. Starting  while true; do tail /dev/zero; done: no freezes. The OOM killer comes quickly, the system recovers quickly.\n        It&#39;s easy to build a deb package with the latest git snapshot.

It could be used as insulation within   to reduce noise by up to 16 decibels\u2014reducing the 105-decibel roar of a jet   taking off to a sound closer to that of a hair-dryer.\n  The aerogel&#39;s meringue-like structure makes it extremely light, meaning it could act as an insulator within aircraft engine nacelles, with almost no increase in overall weight. The material is currently being further optimised by the research team to offer improved  , offering benefits to fuel efficiency and safety.\n  Researchers from Bath&#39;s Materials and Structures Centre (MAST) have published a method for manufacturing the materials in the journal Nature  Scientific Reports.\n  Professor Michele Meo, who led the research, says: &#34;This is clearly a very exciting material that could be applied in a number of ways\u2014initially in aerospace but potentially in many other fields such as automotive and marine transport, as well as in building and construction.\n   &#34;We managed to produce such an extremely low density by using a liquid combination of graphene oxide and a polymer, which are formed with whipped air bubbles and freeze-casted. On a very basic level, the technique can be compared with whipping   to create meringues\u2014it&#39;s solid but contains a lot of air, so there is no weight or efficiency penalty to achieve big improvements in comfort and noise.&#34;\n  Although the team&#39;s initial focus is in working with partners in aerospace to test the material as a sound insulator in aeroplane engines, they say it could also be used to create panels in helicopters, or car engines. They estimate that the aerogel could be in use within 18 months.

In this paper we analyze the swing ratio (beat-upbeat ratio) implied by the drummer on the ride cymbal. Extending previous work, we propose a new method for semi-automatic swing ratio estimation based on pattern recognition in onset sequences. As a main contribution, we introduce a novel time-swing ratio representation called swingogram, which locally captures information related to the swing ratio over time. Based on this representation, we propose to track the most plausible trajectory of the swing ratio of the ride cymbal pattern over time via dynamic programming. We show how this kind of visualization leads to interesting insights into the peculiarities of jazz musicians improvising together.\n To cite this article:  Christian Dittmar, Martin Pfleiderer, Stefan Balke &amp; Meinard M\u00fcller (2018) A\n      A typical micro-rhythmic trait of jazz performances is their \u2018swing feel.\u2019 According to several studies,\n uneven eighth notes contribute decisively to this perceived quality.

It don\u2019t mean a thing if it\n ... Dittmar et al. address microtiming deviations in jazz [45, 44], and Marchand et al. [107] determine the &#34;level of swing&#34; of diverse genres. These works are concerned with simpler rhythmic patterns-consisting of two eight-notes-and the authors use the autocorrelation computed from an ODF as feature. ...\n ... By looking at the autocorrelation one can obtain information about the relative position of events in a straightforward manner, similarly as it is done by clustering different pattern occurrences as in 3.2.1. The authors of these works propose interesting representations of microtiming deviations such as the swing-ratio [107] or the swingogram  [44], which intend to bring information about the performance other than meter and tempo. This kind of effort in the literature helps closing the gap between what characterizes a musical performance and what automatic-analysis tools can retrieve. ...\n ... 1 Figure 9.1 illustrates an example of microtiming at the sixteenth note level. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39;  [44,107,37]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n Computational rhythm analysis deals with extracting and processing meaningful rhythmical information from musical audio. It proves to be a highly complex task, since dealing with real audio recordings requires the ability to handle its acoustic and semantic complexity at multiple levels of representation. Existing methods for rhythmic analysis typically focus on one of those levels, failing to exploit music\u2019s rich structure and compromising the musical consistency of automatic estimations. In this work, we propose novel approaches for leveraging multi-scale information for computational rhythm analysis. Our models account for interrelated dependencies that musical audio naturally conveys, allowing the interplay between different time scales and accounting for music coherence across them. In particular, we conduct a systematic analysis of downbeat tracking systems, leading to convolutional-recurrent architectures that exploit short and long term acoustic modeling; we introduce a skip-chain conditional random field model for downbeat tracking designed to take advantage of music structure information (i.e. music sections repetitions) in a unified framework; and we propose a language model for joint tracking of beats and micro-timing in Afro-Latin American music. Our methods are systematically evaluated on a diverse group of datasets, ranging from Western music to more culturally specific genres, and compared to state-of-the-art systems and simpler variations. The overall results show that our models for downbeat tracking perform on par with the state of the art, while being more musically consistent. Moreover, our model for the joint estimation of beats and microtiming takes further steps towards more interpretable systems. The methods presented here offer novel and more holistic alternatives for computational rhythm analysis, towards a more comprehensive automatic analysis of music.\n ... In some cases, the events in music present small-scale temporal deviations with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid, a phenomenon here referred to as microtiming. The interaction between microtiming deviations and other rhythmic dimensions contribute to what has been described as the sense of &#39;swing&#39; or &#39;groove&#39; [8, 9,30]. The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. ...\n ... The systematic use of these deviations is of structural importance in the rhythmic and stylistic configuration of many musical genres. This is the case of jazz  [9,10,20,38], Cuban rumba [2], Brazilian samba [32,39] and Uruguayan candombe [22], among others. Consequently, the analysis of these music genres without considering microtiming leads to a limited understanding of their rhythm. ...\n ... The proposal exploits some simplifications: assuming constant tempo and swing ratio, and propagating beat positions based on the most likely position of the first beat. More recent works perform semi-automatic analysis still relying on informed tempo  [9,10], or using an external algorithm for its estimation [30]. Within the context of candombe and samba, microtiming characterization has also been addressed using either semi-automatic or heuristic methods [17,22,32]. ...\n Events in music frequently exhibit small-scale temporal deviations (microtiming), with respect to the underlying regular metrical grid. In some cases, as in music from the Afro-Latin American tradition, such deviations appear systematically , disclosing their structural importance in rhythmic and stylistic configuration. In this work we explore the idea of automatically and jointly tracking beats and microtiming in timekeeper instruments of Afro-Latin American music, in particular Brazilian samba and Uruguayan candombe. To that end, we propose a language model based on conditional random fields that integrates beat and onset likelihoods as observations. We derive those activations using deep neural networks and evaluate its performance on manually annotated data using a scheme adapted to this task. We assess our approach in controlled conditions suitable for these timekeeper instruments, and study the microtiming profiles&#39; dependency on genre and performer, illustrating promising aspects of this technique towards a more comprehensive understanding of these music traditions.\n ... As one central benefit, computational methods enable corpus-based studies on a large scale. Several studies have been conducted recently for different music genres including pop music [13], jazz [1, 6,9], and Western classical music [2,17,21,24], and also in the field of ethnomusicology [14,16,19]. For conducting such corpus studies, a number of different aspects are important. ...\n ... Beyond its size and composition, the representation of the music data constitutes an important aspect. For example, the data can be given as a symbolic transcription [9,16], as a graphical score [17], or as an audio recording  [6,13,18]. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the music representation type on the corpus analysis results. ...\n ... A major benefit of the WJD lies in its clean annotations of the solo melody (fundamental frequency, F0), which create a controlled environment for systematic experiments. The data served as basis for a number of musicological studies, which mainly focus on performance analysis [1, 6,9]. ...\n For musicological studies on large corpora, the compilation of suitable data constitutes a time-consuming step. In particular, this is true for high-quality symbolic representations that are generated manually in a tedious process. A recent study on Western classical music has shown that musical phenomena such as the evolution of tonal complexity over history can also be analyzed on the basis of audio recordings. As our first contribution, we transfer this corpus analysis method to jazz music using the Weimar Jazz Database, which contains high-level symbolic transcriptions of jazz solos along with the audio recordings. Second, we investigate the influence of the input representation type on the corpus-level observations. In our experiments , all representation types led to qualitatively similar results. We conclude that audio recordings can build a reasonable basis for conducting such type of corpus analysis.\n ... Moreover, music recommender systems could use the data to better rate the danceability and rhythmic similarity between different songs. Going more into musicological research, there is a high interest in determining microrhythmic properties such as swing, shuffle and groove [16]-  [18] inherent in music recordings. Robust ADT in conjunction with precise estimation of onset times (see discussion in Sect. ...\n ... For example, if the desired output is a musical score or tabulature, the time resolution for the detected onsets can be relatively coarse as onset times are quantized based on the smallest increment within a metrical grid (i.e., 16th or 32nd notes), for these kind of representations. For other applications, like analysis of (un-)intentional variation of onset timings by human performers (e.g.,for humanization), musicological studies of micro-timing [16]-  [18], or extraction of a precise symbolic representation (e.g.,MIDI files), a greater precision is required. Perceptionally, the lower bound of the time-gap which allows humans to identify two click sounds as separate is somewhere in the range of 8 -10 ms [90]. ...\n In Western popular music, drums and percussion are an important means to emphasize and shape the rhythm, often defining the musical style. If computers were able to analyze the drum part in recorded music, it would enable a variety of rhythm-related music processing tasks. Especially the detection and classification of drum sound events by computational methods is considered to be an important and challenging research problem in the broader field of Music Information Retrieval. Over the last two decades, several authors have attempted to tackle this problem under the umbrella term Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT). This paper presents a comprehensive review of ADT research, including a thorough discussion of the task-specific challenges, categorization of existing techniques, and evaluation of several state-of-the-art systems. To provide more insights on the practice of ADT systems, we focus on two families of ADT techniques, namely methods based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Recurrent Neural Networks. We explain the methods&#39; technical details and drum-specific variations and evaluate these approaches on publicly available datasets with a consistent experimental setup. Finally, the open issues and under-explored areas in ADT research are identified and discussed, providing future directions in this field.\n ... Dynagrams and tempograms, for example, are used to visualize various temporal levels of loudness and tempo variations, respectively.  Dittmar et al. (2018) devised swingogram representations by analyzing and tracking the swing ratio implied by the ride cymbal in jazz swing performance. This visualization enables insights into jazz improvisation such as the interaction between a soloist and the drummer. ...\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition. Different performances of the same composition may vary in terms of performance parameters such as timing or dynamics, and these variations may have a major impact on how a listener perceives the music. The analysis of music performance has traditionally been a peripheral topic for the MIR research community, where often a single audio recording is used as representative of a musical work. This paper surveys the field of Music Performance Analysis (MPA) from several perspectives including the measurement of performance parameters, the relation of those parameters to the actions and intentions of a performer or perceptual effects on a listener, and finally the assessment of musical performance. This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n ... Microtiming deviations and their variation across time have been studied in the context of time-keeper instruments (e.g., in Brazilian samba [12], Uruguayan candombe [18], and jazz  [21]). While previous approaches focus on within-instrument rhythmic patterns, we also explore the microtiming generated between time-keepers and nontime-keeper instruments. ...\n Maracatu de baque solto&#34; is a Carnival performance combining music, poetry, and dance, occurring in the Zona da Mata Norte region of Pernambuco (Northeast Brazil). Maracatu percussive music is strongly repetitive, and is played as loud and as fast as possible. Both from an MIR and ethnomusicological perspective this makes a complex musical scene to analyse and interpret. In this paper we focus on the extraction of microtiming profiles towards the longer term goal of understanding how rhythmic performance in Maracatu is used to promote health and well-being. To conduct this analysis we use a set of recordings acquired with contact microphones which minimise the interference between performers. Our analysis reveals that the microtiming profiles differ substantially from those observed in more widely studied South American music. In particular, we highlight the presence of dynamic microtim-ing profiles as well as the importance of the choice of timekeeper instrument, which dictates how the performances can be understood. Throughout this work, we emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in which MIR, audio engineering, and ethnomusicology must interact to provide meaningful insight about this music.\n A musical performance renders an acoustic realization of a musical score or other representation of a composition.

This paper also discusses MPA as it relates to MIR, pointing out opportunities for collaboration and future research in both areas.\n The advent of affordable digital sampling technology brought about great changes in music production. Experienced producers of sample-based electronic music (SBEM) are capable of understanding the intricate relationship between a sampled source and its use in a new track, harnessing its properties to shape the structure, timbre, and rhythm of their compositions. However, automated analysis of the phenomena surrounding both SBEM and the sources it uses for its samples is a challenge which involves many tasks from music information retrieval (MIR) and audio processing. In this thesis we develop models and techniques to better understand SBEM at different levels. In particular, we offer four main technical contributions to retrieval and analysis tasks. First, we explore how timbral changes affect the spectral peak maps used in audio fingerprinting as a means to identify overlapping samples. Second, we analyze the structure of typical SBEM tracks using audio decomposition based on non-negative matrix factor deconvolution (NMFD). Third, we investigate the interaction of timbre and structure by designing a mid-level audio feature based on cascaded harmonic-residual-percussive source separation (CHRP). Fourth, we apply random forests to identify the quintessential sampling source: drum breaks. Given their prominent role in SBEM, we devote considerable attention to drum breaks. As an application to computational musicology, we formalize an algorithm for calculating local swing ratio in drum breaks and adapt an autocorrelation-based method to analyze their microrhythmic properties. Finally, we present a creative application to music production which allows combining the temporal and timbral properties of two separate drum breaks (redrumming). Despite the massive commercial success of SBEM and the practice of sampling, they mostly remain outside the attention of formal academic studies and MIR research. In this thesis our overarching goal is to identify and formalize some of the fundamental audio processing tasks related to SBEM, proposing methods that can seed further research.\n Music constitutes a challenging multimedia scenario. Besides music recordings, there exist a number of other media objects including symbolic music representations, video recordings, scanned sheet music, or textual metadata.

", "note_en": "On May 17, the City Council of Mesa, Arizona, approved the  $800 million development of an enormous data center -- a warehouse filled with computers storing all of the photos, documents and other information we store \u201cin the cloud\u201d -- on an arid plot of land in the eastern part of the city.\n But keeping the rows of powerful computers inside the data center from overheating will require up to 1.25 million gallons of water each day, a price that Vice Mayor Jenn Duff believes is too high.\u201cThis has been the driest 12 months in 126 years,\u201d she said, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWe are on red alert, and I think data centers are an irresponsible use of our water.\u201d\n   Duff was the only Mesa City Council member to vote against  the development. But she\u2019s one of a growing number of people nationwide raising concerns about the proliferation of data centers,  which guzzle electricity and water while creating relatively few jobs, particularly in drought-stricken parts of the United States.\n  The spike in use of data-intensive cloud services such as video conferencing tools, video streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube and online gaming, particularly as people quarantined during the pandemic, has increased demand for the computing power offered by data centers globally. And this means more data centers are being built every day by some of America\u2019s largest technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google and used by millions of customers.  According to the Synergy Research Group, there were about 600 \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers, massive operations designed and operated by a single company that then rents access to cloud services, globally by the end of 2020. That\u2019s double the number there were in 2015. Almost 40 percent of them are in the United States, and  Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of the total.\n The U.S. also has at least 1,800 \u201ccolocation\u201d data centers, warehouses filled with a variety of smaller companies\u2019 server hardware that share the same cooling system, electricity and security, according to  Data Center Map. They are typically smaller than hyperscale data centers but,  research has shown, more resource intensive as they maintain a variety of computer systems operating at different levels of efficiency.\n Many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. Researchers at Virginia Tech estimate that one-fifth of data centers draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds, mostly in the Western United States, according to a  paper published in April.\n  Typically, where data centers are located is based on proximity to customers and infrastructure, the cost of land, the tax incentives offered by local governments and access to low-cost electricity, the researchers said.\n \u201cI am not sure the degree to which environmental considerations are in the decision-making process,\u201d said Landon Marston, lead author of the paper.\n All centers need some form of cooling technology, typically either computer room air-conditioning systems -- essentially large units that cool air with water or refrigerant -- or evaporative cooling, which evaporates water to cool the air. Evaporative cooling uses a lot less electricity, but more water. Since water is cheaper than electricity, data centers tend to opt for the more water-intensive approach.\n The growth in the industry shows no signs of slowing. The research company Gartner predicts that spending on global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion this year, an increase of 6 percent from 2020, followed by 3-4 percent annually over the next three years. This growth comes at a time of record temperatures and drought in the United States,  particularly in the West.\n  \u201cThe typical data center uses about 3-5 million gallons of water per day -- the same amount of water as a city of 30,000-50,000 people,\u201d said Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University.\n  Although these data centers have become  much more energy and water efficient over the last decade, and don\u2019t use as much water as other industries such as agriculture, this level of water use can still create potential competition with local communities over the water supply in areas where water is scarce, he added.\n But some tech companies like Google say they are trying to address their water use.\n \u201cAs part of our water stewardship efforts, we\u2019re working to utilize water more efficiently and exploring ways to incorporate circularity,\u201d said Gary Demasi, senior director of energy and location operations at Google. \u201cWe have a site-specific approach where we work within the constraints of the local hydrological environment to find the best solutions.\u201d\n He added that \u201cmany arid environments provide an abundant supply of carbon-free solar and wind energy,\u201d which explains why data centers are drawn to those areas.\n  Sergio Loureiro, vice president of core operations for Microsoft, said that the company  has pledged to be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030, which means it plans to replenish more water than it consumes globally. This includes reducing the company\u2019s water use and investing in community replenishment and conservation projects near where it builds facilities.\n    In recent years,  tensions over water use by data centers have flared in communities across the United States. In 2017, conservation groups in South Carolina  criticized Google over its request for a permit to draw 1.5 millions of gallons of water per day from a depleted aquifer to cool its expanding data center in Goose Creek. The facility already required 4 million gallons of tap water each day, and residents and conservation groups were concerned about the company\u2019s  impact on the dwindling groundwater supply. After a two-year battle with the South Carolina Coastal Conservation league over the plans, Google reached an agreement to use only groundwater under limited conditions, for example, during maintenance work or as a backup during drier months, and instead pay for an alternative source of surface water from the Charleston Water System.\n  Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said that the company partnered with local community stakeholders and water conservation experts to assess the data center\u2019s impact and conducted studies that showed that even in an \u201cextreme worst-case scenario\u201d the data center\u2019s water use in the area would be sustainable.\n Both companies and consumers need to start treating water conservation as seriously as reducing carbon emissions, experts say.\n   \u201cWe are going to experience a drier and more water-scare future, and every drop of water counts,\u201d said Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Amazon, Microsoft and Google causing these water footprints. But it\u2019s you and me, searching and needing data that ends up in these data centers.\u201d\n Ajami said that water has been historically undervalued as a resource in part because it has been cheap for companies to purchase. While many industries have taken great leaps in reducing their electricity use and carbon footprints, they lag behind in water efficiency throughout their supply chains, she said.\n  \u201cWe often overlook the communities impacted, who are often disadvantaged,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was a wealthy community, maybe they wouldn\u2019t allow the data centers to be built in their backyard.\u201d\n   Water conservation experts say that a key challenge has been the lack of alignment between cities\u2019 economic development plans and their resource conservation efforts. Often the promise of attracting a household-name technology company to build a billion-dollar data center that will bring jobs and investment to the region will override concerns over the water supply.\n  \u201cCities don\u2019t want to tell tech companies that they can\u2019t come to their city because of lack of water,\u201d said Cora Kammeyer, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on water conservation.\n   \u201cWhen it comes to economic development, I don\u2019t think we are fully transparent about the water concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep the image that we are a great place to invest and start a business. But we don\u2019t like to talk about the water.\u201d The Mesa project approved on May 17, which was submitted under the name of a developer called Redale LLC, has been shrouded in secrecy. The name of the company that will run the data center has only been supplied to the city under a nondisclosure agreement, although one Mesa city source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was Facebook. The specialist news site  Data Center Dynamics also reported that it was likely to be Facebook based on similarities in the planning specifications to its other data centers. Facebook declined to comment, and Redale did not respond to a request for comment. The proposed data center will employ an estimated 150 people across three buildings and pay the city millions of dollars in sales tax on the construction and utilities.\n Duff added that even though data centers don\u2019t use as much water as other industries, they are \u201cstill depleting water in the desert, and that is a concern.\u201d\n She noted that this is the \u201ceighth or ninth\u201d data center project in Mesa. The city previously approved a Google facility, currently under construction, that will consume up to 4 million gallons of water per day,  as reported by Bloomberg. The Redale project represents a significant milestone to Mesa\u2019s water supply as it\u2019s the first where the city required the developer to obtain water credits from the Salt River Project to use groundwater in the event that the city can\u2019t meet the data center\u2019s demand for water.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could say we had enough water for the business,\u201d Duff said.\n  Surface water supplies that Arizona uses from Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, and the Colorado River that feeds it, have already  dwindled to their lowest levels ever, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal water management agency. The water level is so low that federal restrictions are likely to be triggered on Arizona\u2019s water allocation from the reservoir, which could happen at the start of 2022. S ix other states in the West could also face such restrictions.\n As that happens, Duff said, more companies will start to draw on their \u201cwater credits\u201d to use groundwater supplies. However,  according to research by Arizona State University, these water credits are over allocated, meaning that if everybody started using them at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough water to go around.\n \u201cWe are very resourceful, but I think we need to wake up,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe analysis shows our safeguards aren\u2019t there and we need to come up with a concrete plan instead of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n   To the south of Mesa, the city of Chandler, Arizona, has taken a different approach. In 2015 the city passed an ordinance that restricted new water-intensive businesses from developing unless they aligned with the city\u2019s plan for economic development. It effectively deters businesses that use a lot of water but don\u2019t create many jobs, including data centers, in favor of those that create thousands of jobs,  such as semiconductor plants.\n  The city\u2019s water resource manager, Gregg Capps, said the ordinance, the first of its kind in the U.S., was introduced as a direct result of discovering in 2013 how much water one of the data centers in the city was using after the company started requesting additional water connections. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them back then, but that brought our attention to their water use,\u201d he said.\n His team took their concerns to the City Council, which spent months developing the ordinance. Since it was adopted in 2015, there have been no new data center developments in Chandler.\n \u201cWater is a strategic resource. It\u2019s important to us,\u201d Capps said.\n   The Silicon Valley technology companies that dominate the hyperscale data center market -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- are conscious of the business and reputational risk associated with data centers\u2019 thirst. All of them have made some progress in reducing their data centers\u2019 water footprint through innovative cooling strategies. These include free-air cooling, which uses fresh outdoor air to cool a space, and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in a liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, taking the heat with it. However, free-air cooling only really works in cooler climates, and immersion was just used  for the first time in a commercial setting by Microsoft in April.\n  Some companies,  including Microsoft have developed underwater or partially submerged data centers that rely on large bodies of already cool water to disperse heat.\n Google\u2019s Demasi said that the company cooled its data centers using seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium and recycled wastewater in the United States, at its site in Douglas County, Georgia.\n  Switching over to new technologies can be extremely costly, and data center operators are more likely to wait until the end of the lifecycle of the existing equipment than retrofit cooling systems, said Todd Boucher, founder of the data center design firm Leading Edge Design Group.\n   In Mesa, Duff is thinking about the legacy of the decisions her city, and others, are making about water now. \u201cI am 61 years old, and I know that in whatever lifetime I have left I will not see the total impact of what we are doing today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our children and their children will, and we have to take responsibility for that.\u201d\u201cI hope the next generation does not look back at ours and say, \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we saw the warnings and started taking aggressive measures in order to preserve our planet and our lives.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:59:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51ccc39be54934eba67eff9d55cfe0b6.png", "infoid": 1066936, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Phabricator\u662f\u4e00\u7ec4\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 \u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u6258\u7ba1\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002  GitHub\u662f\u8d85\u8fc76500\u4e07\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7ef4\u57fa\u514b\u9686\u5982\u6b64\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002  \u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9\u5b83\u6bcf\u5929\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u95f2\u901b\u3002  \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002 \u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0cDEVOPS\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5236\u4f5c\u3002  Microsoft\u56e2\u961f\u662fMicrosoft 365\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u96c6\u7ebf\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002  Gitter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u957f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u793e\u533a\u3002 \nTutanota\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u79c1\u5bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002  \u5c06\u516c\u5171Web\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002  Outlook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u60a8\u7ba1\u7406\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e5\u5386\uff0c\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002  LucidChart\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u4eceJira\uff0cBitbucket\uff0cSonarqube\u6536\u96c6\u654f\u6377\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u5f39\u6027\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5728Kibana\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316  CLI\u5de5\u5177\u4eceJIRA\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff06amp;

Consequently, it has become important to pay attentionto these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We presentand motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thoroughsurvey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modelingtechniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We alsopresent an experiment-based guide along with code, for practitioners tooptimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the firstcomprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers thelandscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. Ourhope is that this survey would provide the reader with the mental model and thenecessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques toimmediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas forfurther research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:52:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "It took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since the early 2010\u2019s, it has been booming \u2014 and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java and JavaScript in popularity.\n But until when will that trend continue? When will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?\n Putting an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting Python\u2019s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.\n   Python\u2019s success is reflected in the  Stack Overflow trends, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform. Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.\n  While R has been plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline, Python\u2019s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are tagged \u201cpython\u201d, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for that.\n  Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn\u2019t only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large and supportive community.\n So if you have any issue while you\u2019re coding in Python, the odds are high that you\u2019ll be able to solve it with a single Google search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and written something helpful about it.\n  It\u2019s not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very human-readable.\n For starters, there\u2019s no need to specify the data type. You just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it\u2019s an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for beginners. If you\u2019ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is your program won\u2019t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.\n And if you\u2019ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you\u2019ll know how understandable Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it\u2019s a rather bumpy read compared to Python code.\n  Since Python has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose. These days, you can find a package for almost everything.\n Want to crunch numbers, vectors and matrices? NumPy is your guy. Want to do calculations for tech and engineering? Use SciPy. Want to go big in data manipulation and analysis? Give Pandas a go. Want to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use Scikit-Learn.\n Whichever computational task you\u2019re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments, can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.\n  Based on the previous elaborations, you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.\n  Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you\u2019ll need about 2\u201310 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language.\n There are  various reasons for that. One of them is that it\u2019s dynamically typed \u2014 remember that you don\u2019t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time.\n Another reason is that Python can only execute one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes \u2014 Python needs to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could mess that up.\n In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.\n But at the end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten so cheap that we\u2019re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn\u2019t really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.\n  Originally, Python was dynamically scoped. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.\n The problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every possible context \u2014 which is tedious. That\u2019s why most modern programming languages use static scoping.\n Python tried to transition to static scoping, but messed it up. Usually, inner scopes \u2014 for example functions within functions \u2014 would be able to see and change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.\n  Despite all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive. Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.\n On the other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means that Lambdas cannot be used for them.\n This distinction between expressions and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn\u2019t occur in other languages.\n   In Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code. This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.\n Other languages, for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.\n Newer languages like Haskell solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax for those who wish to go without.\n  As we\u2019re witnessing the shift from desktop to smartphone, it\u2019s clear that we need robust languages to build mobile software.\n But not many mobile apps are being developed with Python. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be done \u2014 there is a Python package called Kivy for this purpose.\n But Python wasn\u2019t made with mobile in mind. So even though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.\n To be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come. But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it\u2019s safe to say that learning Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.\n  A Python script isn\u2019t compiled first and then executed. Instead, it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a lot of tests. Like, a lot of tests.\n This is great for beginners since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.\n   Rust offers the same kind of safety that Python has \u2014 no variable can accidentally be overwritten. But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing. It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according to  StackOverflow Insights.\n Go is great for beginners like Python. And it is so simple that it\u2019s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go developers are among the  highest-paid programmers on the market.\n Julia is a very new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now, one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.\n While there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies, most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small, as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is clear: upwards.\n  Given the ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade, maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.\n Which of the languages it will be \u2014 Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future \u2014 is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.\n This article was written by \u00a0 Rhea Moutafis\u00a0and was originally published on \u00a0 Towards Data Science.

\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "In 1993, a media studies professor at Fordham University named Edward Wachtel visited several  famous caves in southern France, including Lascaux, Font-de-Gaume, Les Combarelles, and La Mouthe. His purpose: to study the cave art that has justly made these caves famous. \u00a0Wachtel was puzzled by what he called &#34;spaghetti lines&#34; on the drawings, partially obscuring them. There were also images of, say, an ibex with two heads, a mammal with three trunks, or a bull drawing superimposed over the drawing of a deer.\n His guide for the La Mouthe tour was a local farmer, and since there were no electric lights in this cave, the farmer brought along a gas lantern. When the farmer swung the lantern inside the cave, the color schemes shifted, and the engraved lines seemed to animate. &#34;Suddenly, the head of one creature stood out clearly,&#34; Wachtel recalled. &#34;It lived for a second, then faded as another appeared.&#34;\u00a0As for those mysterious spaghetti lines, &#34;they became a forest or a bramble patch that concealed and then reveled the animals within.&#34;\n Wachtel subsequently published a paper entitled, &#34; The First Picture Show: Cinematic Aspects of Cave Art,&#34; in which  he concluded that the cave drawings were meant to be perceived in three dimensions\u2014one of them being time. These could have been the first &#34;protomovies,&#34; he thought.\n It&#39;s an intriguing take, although it must be said that Wachtel&#39;s ideas are speculative. There is no way to definitively prove what those prehistoric cave artists intended, and therefore it&#39;s unwise to draw strong inferences about these being cinematic in nature, or to assume that this tells us anything about prehistoric artists&#39; conception of time. But his point about the importance of viewing cave paintings under the lighting conditions in which they were created and viewed in prehistoric times is sound.\n  Wachtel&#39;s story recently resurfaced in  a Twitter thread, and it couldn&#39;t be more timely. Lighting sources could indeed hold vital clues to the different ways prehistoric peoples used caves, according to\u00a0 a new paper\u00a0by a team of Spanish scientists, published in the journal PLOS ONE. They conducted  in situ experiments with three different kinds of Paleolithic lighting sources, in the hopes of shedding some light (pun intended) on what those various illumination methods might tell us about the emergence of &#34;human symbolic and artistic behavior&#34; in the form of cave art.\n There are nearly 350 such prehistoric caves in France and Spain alone, including the oldest cave painting yet known: a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Caceres, Spain, likely drawn by a Neanderthal some 64,000 years ago. (The oldest known depiction of an animal was discovered in 2018 on the island of Borneo in Indonesia, dating back 40,000 years.)\u00a0The Spanish team chose to conduct their experiments at the Isuntza 1 Cave in Spain&#39;s Basque country, and selected two distinct spaces in particular.\n    The first was a large, wide chamber with walls of bedrock, with 99.7 percent relative humidity and an average temperature of 17.6 degrees C (63.6 degrees F). \u00a0They thought it would be ideal as a &#34;staying chamber&#34; for the experiments The second space was a second, slightly smaller chamber with similar relative humidity (99.9 percent) and average temperatures (14.2 degrees C, or 57.5 degrees F) similar to the first space.\u00a0The two spaces are connected by a rough passage 40 meters long (about 131 feet).\n  The Spanish researchers chose lighting types for their eight experiments based on known archaeological data: five torches tested in both spaces and the passage, as well as two stone lamps with animal fat, and a small fireplace, both tested just in the first space. All the torches were made from dry juniper branches joined together, like the remains of ancient torches found in the Aldene and Reseau Clastres caves. The researchers included a bit of birch to act as tinder, and added pine resin, animal fat, or a combination thereof to assess how well different fuel types worked.\n The lamps were replicas of a sandstone lamp found in La Mouthe Cave in Dordogne, France. They used bovine animal fat as fuel, with three juniper wicks, arranged in a teepee shape inside the lamp. They also built a small fireplace on a clay substrate in the first chamber with juniper and oak as wood fuel.\n For all the lighting experiments, the team measured how long the lighting source lasted (duration); the total amount of light reaching a specific surface or point relative to the human eye (illuminance, or lux); how much illumination was emitted in certain directions (luminous intensity); the minimum distance between the light source and total darkness (action radius); and luminance, which connects light intensity with the surface of the source. They also kept track of the highest temperature reached by each type of lighting source.\n    Those measurements showed that the various lighting sources had very different characteristics, and thus were probably used in different contexts. The wooden torches, for instance, emitted light in all directions, up to nearly six meters (19.6 feet), and lasted an average of 41 minutes. The torches exhibited uneven light intensity, and often needed to be relit by waving them from side to side, and they produced a lot smoke. So they worked best for exploring caves or crossing wide spaces. The team also found that adding resin intensified the flame, while adding animal fat extended its duration.\n    In contrast, the grease lamps emitted weaker light akin to the intensity of a candle, over a span of three meters (9.8 feet) or so. They burned consistently, and didn&#39;t smoke, for over an hour, but they had a dazzling effect if the person was moving and didn&#39;t illuminate the floor very well. Also, &#34;It was necessary to maintain constant control over the wick to prevent it from sinking into the fatty fuel, causing the flame to be extinguished,&#34; the authors wrote. This makes the lamps better suited for lighting small cave spaces over a longer period, complementing the advantages of the torches.\n As for the fireplace\u2014the only truly static system\u2014its illumination covered a range of 6.6 meters (21.6 feet). However, it burned for just 30 minutes and gave off a lot of white smoke, making it unsuitable for use unless there were strong enough air currents to disperse that smoke. &#34;The fireplace location was not appropriately placed regarding air currents,&#34; the authors noted, which are &#34;essential to achieving a prolonged stay underground. However, in the case of large fires, convection currents are produced, and they would be efficient enough to evacuate gases outside of the cave.&#34;\n The Spanish team also built a virtual 3D model of a section of the Atxurra cave known as the Ledge of the Horses. It&#39;s a naturally formed platform just above a passage floor, with two panels of about 50 animal engravings: bison, goats, horses, and hinds, many of them overlapping. The ledge was also littered with scattered charcoal, lithic tools, and ashes from three probable fireplaces. In the virtual model, they conducted a spatial analysis of all three tested lighting sources.\n    The modeling showed that the decorated panels would be &#34;barely perceptible&#34; to someone standing in the lower parts of the gallery, even if that person were carrying a lamp or a torch. It would need to be illuminated from the top of the ledge to be seen. In contrast, the fireplaces appeared to be strategically located to illuminate the entire decorated space. Torches did prove to be a good lighting source for accessing that space, however, with an estimated travel time of 38.39 minutes\u2014in line with the measured duration of the torches. &#34;It does not seem by chance that the optimal routes estimated to access this space are covered with scattered charcoals, surely fallen from the torches used in the Magdalenian period,&#34; the authors wrote.\n The findings have no direct bearing on Wachtel&#39;s speculation about prehistoric cinematic art. But the more archaeologists learn about Paleolithic lighting sources, the more we will understand about how those lighting sources affect human perception in a cave environment, with implications for the emergence of cave art. That&#39;s why the Spanish team thinks it is essential to continue conducting these kinds of experiments.\n &#34;Only with a large corpus of archaeological remains, including different types of lighting systems (and fuels), studied through an interdisciplinary approach, will it be possible to adequately reproduce Paleolithic light resources,&#34; they concluded in their paper, &#34;Our experiments in Paleolithic lighting point to planning in the human use of caves in this period, and the importance of lighting studies to travel the activities carried out by our ancestors in the deep areas of caves. &#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:15:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6d1e\u7a74,recreated", "title":

diversify the world of venture capital,  launched a million-dollar fund. Founder Hadiyah Mujhid told me that the capital would provide nondilutive financing to overlooked founders, which they define as Black, Indigenous and LatinX entrepreneurs, replacing the traditional angel round. But she also admitted that supporting founders wasn\u2019t the only primary goal. Instead, she explained to me the importance of what she defines as \u201cteaching capital.\u201d\n Similar to how teaching hospitals give aspiring doctors a way to practice and learn their craft before formally entering the field, the fund wants to do that for their some 230 aspiring investors that they already work with, many stemming from historically Black colleges and universities. Notably, nondilutive capital provides entrepreneurs with funding sans equity and a learning experience with lower stakes.\n There are a lot of organizations right now that are starting funds [with] the primary goal of supporting founders. And that\u2019s a goal of ours, but we\u2019re hoping to have a ripple effect of training and really providing on-ramps for the next best-in-class investors \u2026 and in order to do that, they have to have a training vehicle.\n While I\u2019m not always a fan of rebranded names for capital, \u201cteaching capital\u201d is certainly a compelling framing. Track record is everything in this industry, and underrepresented folks often don\u2019t have the benefit or privilege of access on their side \u2014 from a dollar or deals perspective. Scout programs have long existed to fill this gap, but I think that there is still a lacking of intentionality around who feels empowered to write an investment memo, ask questions and be new. This week, BLCK VC  launched its scout program and Google for Startups launched a nondilutive financing instrument for Black founders, underscoring a growing focus in seeding diverse entrepreneurs.\n HBCUvc\u2019s fund was announced nearly one year after it almost shut down due to a lack of capital. Mujhid explained how the unjust killing of George Floyd led to the biggest one-day donation in her nonprofit\u2019s lifetime, which \u201cchanged the trajectory of programming.\u201d She also said that a lot of interest was a knee-jerk reaction, urging people to view this work as a long-term commitment.\n   In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll get into Waymo\u2019s latest raise, the Nubank EC-1 and a Pittsburgh event that I can\u2019t wait to nerd out about.\n    Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving arm,  raised $2.5 billion in its second-ever institutional round. Investors include Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Temasek and, of course, Tiger Global.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Waymo is going external after some internal shuffling. The funding comes only months after CEO John Krafcik stepped down from his title after spending five years in that position. Last month,  Waymo lost its CFO and head of partnerships.\n      Another week, another EC-1! Marcella McCarthy wrote about Nubank, a Brazillian credit card and banking fintech company that just last week raised at a $30 billion valuation. It\u2019s one of the most valuable startups in the world, with over 40 million users.\n Here\u2019s what to know: As McCarthy puts it in the piece, Nubank  started by trying to solve a massive challenge: \u201cHow to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.\u201d Maybe, the story goes on to tell, it would start with California Street.\n  Co-founder dynamics \u201c One woman\u2019s drive to make a neobank as magical as Disney\u201d (1,900 words/8 minutes)\n Launching and scaling \u201c How Nubank\u2019s CX strategy made it one of the most loved digital banks\u201d (2,700 words/11 minutes)\n Market expansion and future \u201c Which Nubank will own the financial revolution?\u201d (2,250 words/9 minutes)\n   In May, thousands of you  read my Duolingo EC-1, a deep dive into Pittsburgh\u2019s favorite edtech unicorn. Now, we\u2019re taking you to Pittsburgh to hear from Karin Tsai,  the head of engineering there, as well as Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian, Mayor Bill Peduto and a smattering of local startups.\n Our  TC City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event will be held on June 29,  so make sure to register here (for free) to listen to these conversations, enjoy the pitch-off and network with local talent.\n Also, a friendly reminder that we\u2019re making a list of  the best growth marketers for startups.

He will continue to also hold the CEO position. This makes it the first time since 2000, when co-founder Bill Gates stepped down as CEO, that the same person is holding both positions, demonstrating the company\u2019s confidence in Nadella\u2019s ability to take it into the future.\n  In February 2014, when Nadella was appointed CEO, Microsoft\u2019s flagship Windows business was weakening, and the company was struggling with its failures in the mobile phone and internet search markets. Nadella, who grew up in Hyderabad and joined Microsoft in the US in 1992, refocused the company around cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and instilled a greater sense of ownership among employees \u2014 moves that paid off handsomely. The company\u2019s share price has risen nearly 600% since 2014. And since the fourth quarter of 2018, Microsoft has frequently been the most valued publicly listed company in the world, with Apple the only other contender for that spot.\n On Nadella\u2019s appointment as chairman, Microsoft said in a statement, \u201cIn this role, Nadella will lead the work to set the agenda for the board leveraging his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify key risks and mitigation approaches for the board\u2019s review.\u201d\n Nadella, 53, succeeds John Thompson, a former CEO of Symantec who took over as chairman when Gates stepped down from that post in 2014.\n In December, in a filing to the US stock market regulator SEC, the board heaped praise on Nadella for the way he navigated the company through the pandemic, and the manner in which he had transformed the company\u2019s culture. \u201cDuring fiscal year 2020, Microsoft increased revenue by 14% year over year, while facing unprecedented constraints due to Covid-19 in the second half of the year. Under Mr Nadella\u2019s leadership during 2020, many of Microsoft\u2019s products achieved significant growth\u2026,\u201d it said.\n The board, the filing said, had asked Nadella to create additional focus on the culture of the organisation for fiscal year 2020 and is very pleased with the results that were achieved. \u201cBased on poll data, 95% of employees feel proud to work at Microsoft. The board credits Mr Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organisation,\u201d it said.\n Nadella was born in Hyderabad. His mother was a Sanskrit lecturer and his father an IAS officer. He attended the Hyderabad Public School, and went on to do a Bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka. He then went to the US to do a Master\u2019s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n            Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:49:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5fae\u8f6f,microsoft,ceo", "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u4e3b\u5e2d ", "title_en": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Now Also Elevated to Microsoft's Chairman", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/satya-nadella-elevated-as-microsoft-chairman/ar-AALa3HE", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5fae\u8f6f", "microsoft", "ceo"]}]
