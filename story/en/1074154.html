I decided to write up the list that I wish I had before they were born. Just reasons why they cry, how to tell the cries apart, and what to do in each case. Yes it’s hard to help babies because they cry for everything, but you can definitely tell the difference between an angry cry (“feed me”) or a pained cry (“I scratched myself”) or a sad cry. (“why did you wake me up?”) You can’t fix em all, but you can do a good amount.</p><p>我有一对刚满三个月大的双胞胎女儿。我决定写下我希望在他们出生前就有的清单。他们哭泣的原因，如何区分哭泣，以及在每种情况下该怎么做。是的，很难帮助婴儿，因为他们为一切而哭泣，但你可以明确区分愤怒的哭泣（“喂我”）或痛苦的哭泣（“我抓伤了自己”）或悲伤的哭泣。（“你为什么叫醒我？”）你不可能把它们都修好，但你可以做很多。</p><p>  This is just based on my experience of getting twins through three months. Every baby is different, but hopefully this still helps.</p><p>这是基于我让双胞胎度过三个月的经验。每个婴儿都不一样，但希望这仍然有帮助。</p><p>   How to tell if it’s this: You will hear this a lot and will know it well. It escalates quickly if not addressed. Also they often give signs ahead of time, like movement of the lips and tongue. The bigger difficulty is knowing when it’s not hunger. At some point you’ll be able to say “this sounds weird, not like hunger” but I also recommend installing one of those baby tracker apps on your phone. (pen and paper works fine, too) We stopped tracking most things pretty quickly, but you have to keep track of when they last ate. If it’s been less than an hour, then maybe they didn’t have enough and it’s hunger. If it’s been two hours, then it’s probably not hunger. If it’s three and a half hours, it’s probably hunger. Also just pick the baby up, and if they try sucking on your arm, they’re hungry. (sometimes they’re not hungry even after three hours)</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：你会听到很多，也会很清楚。如果不解决，它会迅速升级。此外，他们通常会提前发出信号，比如嘴唇和舌头的运动。更大的困难是知道什么时候不是饥饿。在某个时候，你可以说“这听起来很奇怪，不像饥饿”，但我也建议你在手机上安装一个婴儿追踪应用程序。（纸和笔也很好）我们很快就停止跟踪大多数东西，但你必须跟踪它们最后一次进食的时间。如果还不到一个小时，也许他们没有足够的食物，这是饥饿。如果是两个小时，那可能不是饥饿。如果是三个半小时，可能是饥饿。而且只要把孩子抱起来，如果他们试着吮吸你的手臂，他们就饿了。（有时即使三小时后他们也不饿）</p><p> What to do: Feed them. Sounds easy, but at first you will spend a ridiculous amount of time on this. Our kids easily got distracted while eating and then get mad at you if you don’t continue feeding after the distraction. Meaning this could happen: they drink, then take a break because they need to be burped, then drink a little more, then take a pause to poop in their diaper, then drink a little more, then get twitchy because they want the diaper changed, then drink a little more, and finally they’re happy. Early on it took us two hours to feed both twins. (while my example sounds extreme, we had few feedings where there wasn’t at least one interruption and they wanted more after)</p><p>怎么做：喂它们。听起来很简单，但一开始你会花很多时间在这上面。我们的孩子在吃饭时很容易分心，如果你在分心后不继续进食，他们会对你生气。这意味着这可能会发生：他们喝酒，然后休息一下，因为他们需要打嗝，然后再喝一点，然后停下来在尿布里大便，然后再喝一点，然后因为他们想换尿布而抽搐，然后再喝一点，最后他们很高兴。一开始，我们花了两个小时喂这对双胞胎。（虽然我的例子听起来有些极端，但我们几乎没有喂食，至少没有一次中断，之后他们想要更多）</p><p> The amount they eat changes a lot, especially in the first week. In the first couple days after birth, babies eat almost nothing and lose lots of weight. This is normal. When we came home from the hospital all the bottles we had at home seemed ridiculously large. The kids would drink ~10ml per feeding, but the lowest line on the bottle for measuring was at 30ml. But then the next day they ate twice as much, 20ml, then it doubled again the next day to 40ml, and then it increased again to 50ml. After that it increases more slowly, but it’s always increasing and you have to always adjust how much you think they should eat. (as I’m writing this the minimum they’ll eat is ~120ml, the maximum ~220ml. If they push the bottle out at less than 120, I know to wait five minutes and they’ll be hungry again)</p><p>他们吃的量变化很大，尤其是在第一周。在出生后的头几天里，婴儿几乎什么都不吃，体重也减轻了很多。这很正常。当我们从医院回家时，家里所有的瓶子都显得大得离谱。每次喂食时，孩子们会喝大约10毫升，但瓶子上测量的最低线是30毫升。但是第二天他们吃了两倍的量，20毫升，第二天又加倍到40毫升，然后又增加到50毫升。在那之后，它增长得更慢，但它总是在增长，你必须总是调整你认为他们应该吃多少。（在我写这篇文章的时候，他们吃的最少是~120ml，最多是~220ml。如果他们以低于120的速度把瓶子推出，我知道要等五分钟，他们会再次感到饥饿。）</p><p>  In the hospital one nurse told us that newborns really don’t want much. They just want to eat, sleep and poop. And be comfortable, which is a whole category in itself.</p><p>在医院里，一位护士告诉我们，新生儿真的不想要太多。他们只想吃饭、睡觉和大便。舒适，这本身就是一个整体范畴。</p><p>   How to tell if it’s this: This cry starts light and escalates slowly. Often they just fuss a bit, going “eh, eh, eh”. Check the diaper. Don’t always trust the indicator. The indicator goes blue when they pee. If they only pooped, you can’t tell from the outside.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：这种哭声开始时很轻，然后慢慢升级。通常他们只是小题大做，说“呃，呃，呃”。检查尿布。不要总是相信指标。他们小便时指示灯变蓝。如果他们只是大便，你从外面看不出来。</p><p> What to do: Change the diaper. When they’re very little you have to do this a lot. At the peak we went through roughly 25 diapers a day for our twins. Friends tell us similar numbers of 12 diapers per day for one kid. Another friend had a peak day of 20 diapers for one kid in one day. We probably overdid it, but at least if they have a clean diaper and they’re still crying, you can be sure that the problem is something else.</p><p>方法：换尿布。当他们很小的时候，你必须经常这样做。在高峰期，我们每天为双胞胎穿大约25片尿布。朋友们告诉我们，一个孩子每天12块尿布的数量相似。另一位朋友的高峰期是一天为一个孩子提供20条尿布。我们可能做得太过分了，但至少如果他们有干净的尿布，而且还在哭，你可以确定问题出在别的地方。</p><p>  The most common reason for this is when they scratch themselves, or when something is wrong with the outfit. (like they somehow got both legs one one side or the diaper is on too tight)</p><p>最常见的原因是他们刮伤自己，或者衣服出了问题。（就像他们不知怎么把双腿放在一边，或者尿布太紧了）</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: A pain cry is super obvious. It sounds very different from other crying. It’s very clear they’re in pain. You’ll definitely hear this early on, like when they draw blood at the hospital to test for jaundice and other problems.</p><p>如何判断是否是这样：痛哭是非常明显的。这听起来和其他哭声很不一样。很明显他们很痛苦。你肯定会很早就听到这句话，比如当他们在医院抽血检测黄疸和其他问题时。</p><p> What to do: Usually you can address the source of the pain: Wrap their hands so they don’t scratch themselves, etc. Obviously go see a doctor if there is no clear reason. (though also read the point about gas below)</p><p>方法：通常你可以解决疼痛的来源：包裹他们的手，这样他们就不会刮伤自己，等等。如果没有明确的原因，显然要去看医生。（不过也要阅读下面关于气体的内容）</p><p>  This one scared me a lot at first because how do you know how many layers they should wear when it’s freezing out? They’ll let you know if you get it wrong.</p><p>一开始，这件衣服让我很害怕，因为你怎么知道在外面结冰的时候他们应该穿多少层呢？如果你弄错了，他们会让你知道的。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This one is a less intense version of the pain cry. It’s usually clear based on the context, you just have to remember that this could be the problem. E.g. we would dress the kids for freezing weather, then put them in a car seat in a car, and as soon as the car heats up, they’d get too hot and start crying.</p><p>如何判断是否是这样的：这是一种不那么强烈的痛哭。根据上下文通常是清楚的，你只需要记住这可能是问题所在。我们会给孩子们穿上适合寒冷天气的衣服，然后把他们放在车里的汽车座椅上，一旦车热起来，他们就会变得太热，开始哭泣。</p><p> What to do: Add/remove layers. If this was the problem, they will calm down very quickly once they are warmer/colder. The other point where this comes up is when giving them a bath. What I consider a nice hot bath is slightly too warm for a baby. But only slightly. They just want comfortable warm. (or get a bath thermometer)</p><p>操作：添加/删除图层。如果这是问题所在，一旦温度升高/降低，他们会很快平静下来。另一个问题是给他们洗澡的时候。我认为一个好的热水澡对婴儿来说太暖和了。但只有一点点。他们只是想要舒适温暖。（或者拿个浴缸温度计）</p><p>  Babies don’t like it. Took me too long to figure out. At a certain point in the evening you just want rooms to be somewhat dark.</p><p>婴儿不喜欢。我花了太长时间才弄明白。在晚上的某个时候，你只希望房间有点暗。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: I had a crying baby, picked her up, she was still crying, walked into a different room and she stopped. Turned the light on and she complained again. Easy.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：我有一个哭泣的婴儿，抱起她，她还在哭，走进另一个房间，她停了下来。把灯打开，她又抱怨起来。容易的</p><p> What to do: Get smaller lights so you can control the brightness by turning most lights off.</p><p>方法：使用较小的灯光，这样就可以通过关闭大多数灯光来控制亮度。</p><p>  These are more difficult to deal with. You can’t always help them when it’s internal, but surprisingly often you can. One warning: This chapter contains cursed knowledge. There are words like “snot sucker” in here that you might not want to know about, but once you do know about them you can no longer ignore the crying of your baby. Where an innocent parent can just feel bad for their children and try to comfort them, you will know that there is this weird thing you could try that would help, and that knowledge won’t let you be…</p><p>这些问题更难处理。你不能总是在内部帮助他们，但出人意料的是，你经常可以。一个警告：本章包含被诅咒的知识。这里有“鼻涕吸盘”这样的词，你可能不想知道，但一旦你知道了，你就不能再忽视宝宝的哭声了。当一个无辜的父母为他们的孩子感到难过并试图安慰他们时，你会知道有一件奇怪的事情你可以尝试，这会有所帮助，而知识不会让你…</p><p>  A booger can cause them to have trouble breathing, which is very upsetting for them.</p><p>鼻涕会导致他们呼吸困难，这对他们来说非常令人不安。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: If their nose is stuffy while they are crying, that’s a good hint, but if they didn’t have clear breathing  before the crying, then it’s definitely this. In either case you can always try the snot sucker, it doesn’t hurt.</p><p>如何判断是否是这样的：如果他们在哭泣时鼻塞，这是一个很好的提示，但如果他们在哭泣前没有清晰的呼吸，那么肯定是这样的。不管是哪种情况，你都可以试一下鼻涕吸盘，它不疼。</p><p> What to do: Saline spray and a snot sucker. Yes, you do weird things with babies. They can’t blow their own nose. Just spray saline in their nose, this will get them to sneeze which either ejects the snot right away, or at least moves it close to the surface where you can see it. Then you use the snot sucker.</p><p>方法：盐水喷雾和吸管。是的，你对婴儿做了奇怪的事情。他们不能自己擤鼻涕。只需在他们的鼻子里喷生理盐水，这会让他们打喷嚏，要么马上喷出鼻涕，要么至少让鼻涕靠近你能看到的表面。然后你用鼻涕吸盘。</p><p>  Newborns often have trouble getting their poop out. They’re actually great at holding it in. It can be really obvious and the fix is easy, but somehow nobody tells you this… (or any of the other advice in this section…)</p><p>新生儿通常很难排出粪便。事实上，他们很擅长控制局面。这可能是非常明显的，解决方法也很简单，但不知何故，没有人告诉你这个…（或本节中的任何其他建议…）</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: At least with our twins, it was very obvious. They’re clearly trying to push something out. Sometimes they’re grunting. Also, when they started sleeping a little longer at night, they almost always had to go in the morning. You’d always get this type of crying at some point between 5 and 8am.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：至少对我们的双胞胎来说，这是非常明显的。他们显然是想把什么东西推出去。有时他们会咕哝。而且，当他们开始在晚上多睡一会儿时，他们几乎总是在早上去。你总是在早上5点到8点之间的某个时候哭。</p><p> What to do:  Hold them over the sink. Take the diaper off, hands under the legs or butt, just hold them and wait. (the linked video shows holding the legs, but sometimes they like kicking while you hold them, and then it’s better to have the hands under the butt to leave the legs free) The first time I tried this I had a crying baby on my hand, the second time she was really calm and then the poop that she’d been struggling with for an hour came out easily. This was at 1 week old. It worked amazingly well. (she was still crying on the changing table both before and after, like they often did at that age, but while holding her over the sink she was very calm) It’s weird, but no more weird than the snot sucker. Apparently it’s just the normal thing to do with babies in some countries. The other thing that’s worked for friends of ours is a foot massage. Search Youtube, but I haven’t had luck with this myself, so no video recommendations.</p><p>方法：把它们放在水槽上。脱下尿布，双手放在腿下或屁股下，拿着尿布等着。（链接的视频显示他们抱着腿，但有时他们喜欢在你抱着他们的时候踢，然后最好把手放在屁股下面，让腿自由）我第一次尝试这个方法时，我手上有一个哭泣的婴儿，第二次她真的很平静，然后她挣扎了一个小时的大便很容易就出来了。这是在1周大的时候。它运行得非常好。（她在换衣前后都在换衣服的桌子上哭，就像他们在那个年龄时经常做的那样，但当她把她抱在水槽上时，她非常平静）这很奇怪，但并不比那个鼻涕吸盘更奇怪。显然，在一些国家，这只是婴儿的正常行为。另一件对我们的朋友有用的事情是足底按摩。在Youtube上搜索，但我自己也没这么幸运，所以没有视频推荐。</p><p>  You’d think this one is the same as needing to poop, but it’s completely different. I don’t know why. If it’s just a little fart, then they won’t cry. But if they’re really gassy, they will let you know.</p><p>你可能会认为这和需要大便是一样的，但完全不同。我不知道为什么。如果只是一个小屁，他们就不会哭了。但如果它们真的有气体，它们会让你知道的。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This one sounds like they’re in pain. At least a little bit. The surest sign is when they cry, fart, and cry more. There are usually four farts or more behind that that you have to get out for them to calm down.</p><p>如何判断是不是这个：这个听起来像是他们在痛苦。至少有一点。最可靠的迹象是当他们哭泣、放屁和哭泣更多的时候。通常有四个或更多的屁在后面，你必须出去让他们冷静下来。</p><p> What to do: It took us way too long to realize that when they cry in pain, gas can be the problem. So I don’t have a fully established solution. If you try the “hold them over the sink” solution from the poop section, they’ll just be in pain as they try to get the gas out.  Bicycle kicks and  hip rotations worked sometimes, and some people say tummy massages are great. Unfortunately our kids resist the bicycle kicks once they start crying. Gas seems to be a really common problem so there are lots of products for sale that are supposed to help with this: Gas-X for babies, Gripe Water, Probiotics, tubes that you insert in the butt… I don’t like the Windi tube, but it works and I recommend using it once. It’s a hollow tube that you lubricate and then stick in their butt, and then the air has no choice but to come out. The reason why I recommend using it once is that you have to give a belly massage while doing it, which pushes the remaining air out, and it’s the only time you hear immediate results from a belly massage. So after that experience I got better at belly massages… Besides that my mom swears by fennel tea, and in the US Gripe Water seems to be the closest thing. I had one good experience with gripe water, but often it doesn’t seem to do anything. As I said, still trying to come up with a good solution since we realized this one so late.</p><p>怎么办：我们花了很长时间才意识到，当他们痛苦地哭泣时，气体可能是问题所在。所以我没有一个完整的解决方案。如果你试着用粪便区的“把它们放在水槽上”的方法，它们就会在试图把气体排出时感到疼痛。自行车踢腿和髋关节旋转有时会奏效，一些人说腹部按摩很棒。不幸的是，我们的孩子一旦开始哭泣，就会抵制自行车踢。气体似乎是一个非常普遍的问题，所以有很多产品在销售，应该有助于这一点：气体-X的婴儿，牢骚水，益生菌，管插入臀部…我不喜欢Windi管，但它的工作原理，我建议使用一次。这是一个中空的管子，你润滑它，然后粘在它的屁股上，然后空气就别无选择，只能出来。我建议使用一次的原因是，你必须在做腹部按摩的同时进行腹部按摩，这会将剩余的空气排出体外，而且这是你唯一一次听到腹部按摩的即时效果。所以在那次经历之后，我在腹部按摩方面做得更好了……除此之外，我妈妈发誓要喝茴香茶，而在美国，抱怨水似乎是最贴切的东西。我曾经有过一次很好的体验，但通常它似乎没有任何作用。正如我所说，我们一直在努力想出一个好的解决方案，因为我们很晚才意识到这一点。</p><p>  If you didn’t burp enough after feeding, sometimes the baby will cry later.</p><p>如果你在喂奶后没有打嗝，有时宝宝会哭。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: There are two different sounds. If it’s not too bad, it sounds like they got something stuck in their throat. Not something big, it’s just a cry that’s a little raspy, where an adult would clear their throat and be done with it. The other one is if they managed to go to sleep, they will wake up with a loud cry. Which scared us a lot. Now we’re calm when that happens because we know it’s likely to just be a burp.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：有两种不同的声音。如果还不算太糟的话，听起来他们好像有什么东西卡在喉咙里了。不是什么大事，只是一声有点刺耳的哭声，成年人会清嗓子，然后就完蛋了。另一个是，如果他们设法入睡，他们会大哭一声醒来。这让我们非常害怕。现在，当这种情况发生时，我们很平静，因为我们知道这很可能只是打嗝。</p><p> What to do: Pick them up and hold them vertical. High on your shoulder so there is some pressure on their chest but they have to hold their own head up. (you can’t do this when they’re too small) Patting the back is supposed to work but seems unreliable for us, even if we pat them really hard. Walking around with them or bouncing seems to help. When they were very young you could massage the lower part of their back, the soft spot between the ribs and the hips, and they would burp almost immediately. That stopped working once they got muscles there, but some people say that rubbing circles in that same area works…</p><p>方法：把它们捡起来，保持垂直。在你的肩膀上，所以他们的胸部有一些压力，但他们必须抬起头。（当它们太小的时候，你不能这么做）拍拍它们的背部应该是有效的，但对我们来说似乎不可靠，即使我们非常用力地拍拍它们。和他们一起走走或蹦蹦跳跳似乎有帮助。当他们很小的时候，你可以按摩他们背部的下部，肋骨和臀部之间的软点，他们几乎会立即打嗝。一旦他们有了肌肉就停止工作了，但有些人说在同一区域摩擦圆圈是有效的…</p><p>  When you put a baby down too soon after eating, or just move it too much, sometimes the milk comes back up.</p><p>当你在吃过东西后很快就把婴儿放下来，或者只是把它移动太多，有时牛奶又会流出来。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This only happens less than thirty minutes after feeding. They were calm, you put them down, they immediately go to a slightly pained cry. Sometimes followed by throwing up a lot of milk.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：这只发生在喂食后不到30分钟。他们很平静，你把他们放下，他们立刻发出轻微的痛苦的哭声。有时会吐出很多牛奶。</p><p> What to do: Give them more time upright or at at an angle after feeding. After we saw this once or twice, we realized what to do and we would pick them up quickly enough again that they didn’t throw up.</p><p>方法：喂食后给它们更多的直立或成一定角度的时间。在我们看过一两次之后，我们意识到该怎么做，我们会很快把它们捡起来，这样它们就不会呕吐了。</p><p>  At first babies are really easy. They just want to sleep and are only awake long enough to eat and poop. But then they get more complicated.</p><p>一开始，婴儿真的很容易。他们只想睡觉，醒来的时间只够吃东西和大便。但随后它们变得更加复杂。</p><p>  This one is weird. The kid needs to sleep but instead of calming down, they start to cry.</p><p>这个很奇怪。孩子需要睡觉，但他们没有平静下来，而是开始哭泣。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This happens once they stay awake longer. If they stay awake too long they get irritated very easily. The other thing that happened to us somewhat regularly with our kids is this: They’re tired, falling asleep in our arms, we put them to bed, but the act of doing that makes them become more awake. They get a bit fussy but only enough where we think they’ll soon calm down again. Then suddenly they get really angry and cry loudly. This goes on for a short time, say fifteen seconds, then they immediately fall into deep sleep. It’s almost as if they’re resisting the falling asleep.</p><p>如何判断是否是这样：一旦他们保持清醒时间更长，就会发生这种情况。如果他们醒得太久，他们很容易生气。另一件经常发生在我们孩子身上的事情是：他们累了，在我们怀里睡着了，我们把他们放在床上，但这样做会让他们更加清醒。他们有点挑剔，但我们认为他们很快就会平静下来。然后他们突然非常生气，大声哭了起来。这种情况持续很短时间，比如说15秒，然后他们立即进入深度睡眠。就好像他们在抗拒入睡。</p><p> What to do: Put them to bed and give them a minute. If it seems like they should be tired enough to fall asleep, then just watch a little. It sucks, but usually you don’t have to wait long to see which direction the crying goes. If the crying becomes less loud after a minute, give them another minute. If it doesn’t, it could be a different problem. This is not the “cry it out” sleep training. Really just wait a short time to see how it develops. As long as the trend is in the right direction, you can just let them be and it’ll end.</p><p>方法：让他们上床睡觉，给他们一分钟时间。如果他们似乎累得睡着了，那就看一会儿。这很糟糕，但通常你不需要等待很长时间，就可以看到哭泣的方向。如果一分钟后哭声变小，再给他们一分钟。如果没有，那可能是另一个问题。这不是“大声喊出来”的睡眠训练。真的，等一会儿看看它是怎么发展的。只要趋势朝着正确的方向发展，你就可以顺其自然，一切都会结束。</p><p>  This happens for example the first few times when they take a bath, or when you undress them at the doctor.</p><p>例如，在他们洗澡的前几次，或者在你去看医生时脱掉衣服时，就会发生这种情况。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: It’s obvious from their facial expression. They are clearly concerned/scared.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：从他们的面部表情可以明显看出。他们显然很担心/害怕。</p><p> What to do: Hold them securely and allow them to hold on. You don’t want their hands flailing around. In the bath I’d always hold them with my left arm behind their neck, curved so that they could grab onto the fingers of my left hand. Hold them close if you can. Also you just have to be calm. The goal here is to calm the baby down and if you are not calm and try to rush the bath, you’re just making things worse.</p><p>方法：牢牢抓住它们，让它们抓住。你不想让他们的手到处乱动。在洗澡时，我总是把左臂放在他们的脖子后面，弯曲以便他们能抓住我左手的手指。如果可以的话，紧紧抓住他们。你也要冷静。这里的目标是让宝宝平静下来，如果你不冷静，试图冲澡，你只会让事情变得更糟。</p><p>  For us we first saw this at some point in the second month. Babies are usually happy to just be on their own, but at some point they want some attention.</p><p>对我们来说，我们第一次看到这一点是在第二个月的某个时候。婴儿通常很乐意独自一人，但在某些时候，他们需要一些关注。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This is a cry that’s not too loud and doesn’t escalate. The baby was alone for a while, then starts crying but seems happy when you get there. Definitely check the diaper first, but maybe they just want to be entertained.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样的：这是一种不会太大声也不会升级的哭声。婴儿独自一人待了一会儿，然后开始哭泣，但当你到达那里时，他似乎很高兴。当然要先检查尿布，但也许他们只是想娱乐一下。</p><p> What to do: At this point the baby can’t move around on its own and can’t even play. You can do some exercises with it like tummy time (it feels weird to have a crying baby and then make it do pushups in tummy time, but when they’re bored this sometimes helps. They stop crying, but may make “workout sounds” instead) or the bicycle kicks, or show it one of those high-contrast books like “Look, Look!”, (you have to hold it pretty close to their face) or a music toy. If the problem was something else, the baby will let you know. It certainly won’t sit there for 20 minutes happily looking at a book, and it will certainly get really loud if tummy time wasn’t the right choice.</p><p>该怎么办：此时婴儿不能自己走动，甚至不能玩耍。你可以用它做一些锻炼，比如肚子时间（有一个哭闹的宝宝，然后让它在肚子时间做俯卧撑感觉很奇怪，但当他们感到无聊时，这有时会有帮助。他们停止哭泣，但可能会发出“锻炼声”或者骑自行车，或者给它看一本高对比度的书，比如“看，看！”，（你必须把它举得离他们的脸很近）或者一个音乐玩具。如果问题是别的，婴儿会告诉你的。它肯定不会坐在那里愉快地看一本书20分钟，如果肚子痛的时间不是正确的选择，它肯定会变得非常大声。</p><p>  That’s what it’s called. For some reason it’s common for babies to get angry in the evening. This happened for us for at least half the days in the first three months. It sucks. It’s just very important that you know this exists. We were puzzled a lot early on before we knew this was a thing. (we’d wonder “you were doing so well all day, what’s up now?”)</p><p>这就是它的名字。出于某种原因，婴儿在晚上发怒是很常见的。在头三个月里，我们至少有一半的时间都是这样。糟透了。非常重要的是你知道这是存在的。在我们知道这是一件事之前，我们很困惑。（我们想知道“你一整天都做得很好，现在怎么样了？”）</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: This one sounds like they’re hungry. For us this happened after 6pm, and could go on until we were able to put them to bed. Which could be quite late. It’s the witching hour if you can’t figure out the problem. You change the diaper, they only eat a tiny amount, they don’t want to poop, they don’t want to sleep, there doesn’t seem to be anything you can do to help them.</p><p>如何判断是不是这个：这个听起来像是他们饿了。对我们来说，这发生在下午6点以后，可能会一直持续到我们能让他们上床睡觉。可能已经很晚了。如果你想不出问题的话，那就是巫师的时刻了。你换尿布，他们只吃很少的东西，他们不想大便，他们不想睡觉，你似乎无法帮助他们。</p><p> What to do: Since this one sounds like they’re hungry, you’d think that feeding helps. It helps for like a minute, but they won’t eat much and then they get mad at you again. And if you try to feed them repeatedly they’ll drink too much and then throw up. (this literally happened three times to me…) We eventually got good at managing this, but it’s always draining. Step 1 is to strictly wait three hours between feedings during witching hour. Otherwise they either eat too much or too little and you’re creating more problems. Step 2 is to hold them and walk around with them. The movement is key. (when that gets exhausting they also like it if you bounce on a yoga ball while holding them) The way you hold them also matters. The superman hold works well, but I try to not overuse it so it doesn’t lose it’s power. Then, ~2 hours after their previous feeding, they sometimes fall asleep for 30 minutes to an hour. After that sleep, feed them and then put them to bed. This is the routine that we eventually figured out. I don’t know if it would have worked at the first witching hour. It never worked super well, but we managed. I just sometimes had to walk around while carrying a baby for 30 minutes or more so that they wouldn’t cry.</p><p>该怎么办：因为这一个听起来像他们饿了，你会认为喂食有帮助。这有一分钟的帮助，但他们不会吃太多，然后他们会再次生你的气。如果你反复喂它们，它们会喝得太多，然后呕吐。（这确实发生了三次在我身上……）我们最终很好地处理了这件事，但它总是在消耗。第一步是在切换时间内严格等待三个小时。否则，他们要么吃得太多，要么吃得太少，你就会制造更多的问题。第二步是抱着它们，和它们一起走来走去。运动是关键。（当这让人筋疲力尽时，他们也喜欢你拿着瑜伽球弹跳）你拿着瑜伽球的方式也很重要。超人支架工作得很好，但我尽量不过度使用，这样它就不会失去动力。然后，在前一次喂食约2小时后，它们有时会入睡30分钟至1小时。睡觉后，给它们喂食，然后让它们睡觉。这是我们最终发现的惯例。我不知道它在第一个巫术小时是否有效。它从来没有超好地工作过，但我们成功了。我只是有时候带着孩子四处走动30分钟或更长时间，这样他们就不会哭了。</p><p>  We got lucky and didn’t have this in the first three months. At all. So I can’t give recommendations here.</p><p>我们很幸运，在头三个月里没有这个。完全所以我不能在这里给出建议。</p><p>  Here are some things that are easy to address but should be mentioned for completeness.</p><p>以下是一些很容易解决的问题，但为了完整起见，应该提及。</p><p>  Everyone knows to not wake a sleeping baby. Except sometimes they seem to sleep too much and you’re worried they’ll be off-schedule…</p><p>每个人都知道不要吵醒熟睡的婴儿。但有时他们似乎睡得太多，你担心他们会赶不上日程…</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: They just woke up from sleep, and it sounds sad, like “woe is me”.</p><p>如何判断是不是这样：他们刚从睡梦中醒来，听起来很悲伤，就像“我有祸了”。</p><p> What to do: We sometimes want to wake up the baby if they’re sleeping too long during the day. Like if it’s been almost five hours since their last feeding. Which is good at night, but not good during the day. Since they usually sleep on their tummy during the day (they just sleep better, and we can watch them, so it’s safe) we just flip them onto their back, and they’ll wake up sooner. Also, in the hospital we were told to feed them 8 to 12 times a day, and to wake them up if it’s been more than three hours since their last feeding. (I think because the twins were very little at first) This was bad advice. We did it for exactly long enough until they were back at their birth weight, then we let them sleep. They actually ate better and more often after that.</p><p>方法：如果婴儿白天睡得太久，我们有时会想叫醒他们。好像他们上次喂食已经快五个小时了。这在晚上很好，但白天不好。因为他们白天通常趴在肚子上睡觉（他们只是睡得更好，我们可以观察他们，所以很安全），所以我们只要把他们翻到背上，他们就会醒得更快。此外，在医院里，我们被告知每天给他们喂食8到12次，如果他们上次喂食已经超过三个小时，就叫醒他们。（我想是因为这对双胞胎一开始很小）这是个糟糕的建议。我们做了足够长的时间，直到他们恢复到出生时的体重，然后让他们睡觉。事实上，在那之后，他们吃得更好、更频繁。</p><p>  In the first months, babies should spend a lot of time on their tummy, (only while you can watch, due to SIDS) which makes no sense when you first hear it: Why does it matter if the baby is on their belly or on their back? It’s obvious the first time you try it: The baby immediately tries to raise its neck, working out the neck and arm. They need that exercise and they’ll often do a lot of it.</p><p>在最初的几个月里，婴儿应该花很多时间趴在肚子上（只有在你能看到的时候，因为有婴儿猝死综合症），这在你第一次听到它的时候是没有意义的：为什么婴儿趴在肚子上还是背上很重要？当你第一次尝试时，这一点很明显：婴儿立即尝试抬起脖子，锻炼脖子和手臂。他们需要这种锻炼，而且他们经常会这样做。</p><p> How to tell if it’s this: They’re in the middle of working out and are making sounds that sound like they are distressed, but are not cries. If they start crying, that’s not what I’m talking about here. In  this video she makes a little bit of a sound at 20 seconds. She could get a lot louder than this, but it’s not crying.</p><p>如何判断是这样的：他们处于锻炼的中间，发出的声音听起来像是苦恼，但不是哭声。如果他们开始哭泣，那不是我在这里说的。在这段视频中，她在20秒时发出了一点声音。她可能会比这声音大很多，但它不会哭。</p><p> What to do: Don’t do anything. When they had enough they can just lay down and rest. For some reason everyone around me wanted to pick up the baby as soon as it makes the slightest sounds, even though it was clearly exercising. I’d stop them from picking up the baby, we’d watch for ten seconds, then the baby decided that it had enough and would rest its head on the mat and relax. There was no problem to begin with. Obviously if they start actually crying, we’d try to find out what the problem is.</p><p>做什么：什么都不要做。当他们吃饱了，他们可以躺下休息。出于某种原因，我周围的每个人都想在宝宝发出最轻微的声音时就把它抱起来，尽管它显然在运动。我会阻止他们抱起婴儿，我们会观察10秒钟，然后婴儿决定它已经够了，会把头放在垫子上放松。一开始没有问题。显然，如果他们真的开始哭泣，我们会试图找出问题所在。</p><p>  Here are some things that always make a baby stop crying. Don’t abuse these. Sometimes you need to listen to the cry to find out what the problem is. If you always try to shut them down, you might just be leaving them hungry.</p><p>以下是一些总能让婴儿停止哭泣的事情。不要滥用这些。有时你需要倾听哭声来找出问题所在。如果你总是试图让他们闭嘴，你可能只会让他们挨饿。</p><p>  This works like magic in the first month: Lay back on a pillow, put the baby on your chest, facing you, then do a slow rhythmic pat on their back (60bpm or slower) while making a calm sssshhh sound. After 30 seconds they stop crying and calm down and stay calm. Keep making the sssshhh sound until they have slept for at least a minute.</p><p>这就像第一个月的魔术：躺在枕头上，把宝宝放在胸前，面向你，然后在他们的背上做一个缓慢的有节奏的拍打（60bpm或更慢），同时发出一个平静的声音。30秒后，他们停止哭泣，冷静下来，保持冷静。持续发出SSHHH声，直到他们至少睡了一分钟。</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/区分/">#区分</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/cry/">#cry</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/婴儿/">#婴儿</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
