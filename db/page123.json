It was started in 1858 by Brighton\u2019s Guardians more as a cost cutting exercise, than as an attempt to break a world record, but it did break a record and still remains as the deepest \u201cHAND DUG\u201d well in the world.\n Plans for a new workhouse  Back in 1858, plans were in hand to build a new workhouse at the top of what is now  Elm Grove and to add to it an industrial school for juveniles some 2 miles away at Warren Farm. The aim of the school would be to teach the misplaced youth of the town \u201cthe habits of industry\u201d and relieve them from \u201cthe bane of pauperism.\u201d\n The expense of pumped water  However, the expense of having pumped water supplied from the local waterworks, then on the corner of  Lewes Road (now Saunders Park) was considered prohibitive, so the Guardians decided that they would construct a single well for both properties and augment the workforce with labour from the  Dyke Road Workhouse. In their opinion, making relief for the more able pauper, young or old and regardless of gender, conditional on some of the destitute undertaking an aspect of the well\u2019s construction would reduce labour costs and indirectly add a further deterrent to anyone considering applying to the workhouse for poor relief.\n The initial plans were not successful  initial plan was to sink a 6 ft wide, brick lined shaft down some 400 feet to the subterranean water table. All the soil dug out would be placed in buckets and hand winched to a platform at the top of the shaft where it could be disposed of. After 2 years of digging, the shaft had only reached a depth of some 438 feet, but no water had been found. Fearing that they had just missed the supply, the contractor gave instructions for a lateral chamber to be driven some 30 ft northwards, but this too yeilded nothing. Further lateral tunnels were driven westwards and eastwards, but none of them were successful. Failing to acknowledge defeat, the Guardians sanctioned the construction of a further 4 ft wide shaft at the end of the eastern tunnel.\n Digging\u00a0done for 24 hours a day  Work continued for several more years with men working 24 hours a day just by candle light in appalling conditions. Many removed their clothes and worked naked for within the confines of a 4 ft circle teams of men had to dig, load buckets and lay bricks. Winchmen stood on tiny platforms cut into the side of the shaft, passing spoil up and bricks down as the shaft continued forever downwards. One winchman actually plunged to his death.\n Escalating costs caused concern  Above ground the Guardians began to bicker about the expense, for the Woodingdean Well was now costing the local ratepayer some \u00a390 a week and jests about it were frequent. Some said the town was constructing an alternative route to the Antipodes, whereas others described the whole thing as \u201ca great bore\u201d!\n The final break through  At the change of the evening shifts on Sunday 16th March 1862, the bricklayer noticed that the thin crust of earth he was standing on was being slowly pushed upwards like a giant piston. Scrambling up the numerous ladders to each winchman\u2019s platform, he and the others quickly vacated the shaft. It must have been a difficult task for the well had now been sunk to such an amazing depth their successful exit took some 45 minutes. Suddenly with a roar, the piston head crumbled and tools, buckets and ladders flooded up the shaft. Water had at last been found. It had taken over 4 years backbreaking work for a labour force which included many Brighton paupers, to hand dig a shaft some 1285 feet deep (850 of which were below sea level) without the aid of machines.\n An incredible achievement  To put this incredible achievement, distance and the danger into perspective, I can think of no greater analogy than that used in P Mercer &amp; D Holland\u2019s \u201cHunns Mere Pit\u201d which I have interpreted using my own illustration. The Woodingdean Well\u2019s depth into the earth was greater than the height of the Empire State Building. Imagine climbing that building in darkness on a twice daily basis, using just a series of rickety ladders, let alone in a panic situation with water flooding up beneath you and your colleagues!\n  I consent to my name and e-mail address being stored along with this comment, and to the website editors communicating with me by e-mail about the comment if necessary.

And if you take a look at commencement addresses from the past, you\u2019ll see a glimpse of what people in power told privileged young people to believe in and sketches of what the future could be, which we can now consider next to the reality of what came next. Lapham\u2019s Quarterly  is revisiting the history of giving advice to graduates and others in the process of acquiring knowledge or skills.\n  The Book of Ecclesiastes is one of the biblical \u201cwisdom\u201d books and belongs to an ancient literary tradition, beginning in Sumer and Babylonia, of recording the advice of sages. The word  Ecclesiastes derives from the Greek  ekklesiastes, or \u201cone who addresses an assembly,\u201d which is a rough translation of the Hebrew word  Qohelet (also  Koheleth), meaning \u201cpreacher\u201d or \u201cteacher.\u201d Qohelet is the name  given in the text by the apparent author of Ecclesiastes. He also claims to be a king of Jerusalem and the son of David. If that is his true parentage, Qohelet was King Solomon, the tenth-century-  ruler of the Israelites. Jewish and Christian theologians have traditionally followed this attribution by placing Ecclesiastes between the Song of Solomon and the Book of Proverbs, Solomon\u2019s other biblical writings, in the Old Testament. Yet the text\u2019s Aramaic loanwords suggest it was composed in the third century  , after Solomon\u2019s kingdom was divided and Jerusalem became one of the colonies of the Achaemenid Empire.\n Qohelet was a deeply cynical thinker, perhaps because of the diminished state of the Israelites. He describes a world in which success and happiness are not guaranteed, where an individual is largely powerless in the face of human greed, fallibility, and suffering. His advice for readers is to accept the futility of their lives and welcome the knowledge that all human actions are \u201cvanity\u201d or \u201cvapor.\u201d He suggests (perhaps influenced by the Greek philosophy of Epicureanism) that the best course of action is to pursue tranquility and pleasure:\n Therefore eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart. God has already given his approval to thy deeds. At all times be thy garments white, and let oil not be lacking for thy head. Enjoy life with the woman of thy love all the days of thy vain life that God has given thee under the sun. That is thy portion in life and the compensation for thy toil under the sun. Whatever thou can afford with thy substance do, for there is no activity, or reckoning, or knowledge, and no wisdom in Sheol.  1\n Since the first century, scholars have debated why Qohelet\u2019s pessimistic meditation on human life was included in the Bible. Morris Jastrow Jr., an expert on Semitic languages at the University of Pennsylvania, noted in his 1919 translation, \u201cIt is a strange book to have slipped into a sacred collection.\u201d Jastrow set out to produce a new translation of Qohelet\u2019s words, believing that centuries of adaptation and reframing had resulted in a different work than its creator had intended; he was determined to give twentieth-century readers a new impression of a very old text:\n In presenting Qohelet in a new garb, minus the trimmings which were attached to the original composition, it is my hope to make a remarkable literary production more intelligible than is possible by reading it in any of our present-day translations of the Old Testament, which are all modeled on the classic \u201cauthorized\u201d version of 1611, and which all assume the book to be a literary unit in its present form. In other words, I have tried to give the reader the book of Qohelet in its original form, as nearly as that is at present possible.\n Writers from  William Shakespeare to  Edith Wharton have paraphrased Qohelet\u2019s words, and  Leo Tolstoy turned to Ecclesiastes during a midlife crisis of faith, writing in   A Confession that his doubts began with a single realization: \u201cWhat am I?\u2014A part of the infinite. In those few words lies the whole problem.\u201d\n   What gain has a man of all his toil, \tWhich he toils under the sun? \tGeneration comes and generation goes, but the earth remains forever. \tThe sun rises and the sun sets, \tAnd to his rising place he returns. \tAround to the south and circling to the north, \tAround and around goes the wind, \tAnd on its circuits the wind returns. \tAll streams flow into the sea, \tBut the sea is not full. \tTo the place whither the streams flow, \tFrom there they flow back again. \tEverything is wearied, \tBeyond human utterance, \tBeyond sight and hearing. \tWhat has been is that which shall be; \tAnd what has happened is that which shall happen, \tSo that there is nothing new under the sun.\n If something occurs of which one says, \u201cSee, this is new\u201d\u2014ages before us it has already happened. Former occurrences are not recorded, and later occurrences also shall not be remembered by the ages that are to come.\n I, Qohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem, and I applied my mind to seek and explore everything under the sun\u2014a sorry business which God has given the children of men for their affliction. I saw all that happened under the sun\u2014and behold it was all vanity and chasing after wind.\n Now I thought to myself,  I have become great and acquired much more than anyone who reigned before me over Jerusalem. My mind was stored with very much wisdom and knowledge. So I set out to experience frivolity and foolishness, though I knew that this, too, was chasing after wind. I said to myself,  Come, I\u2019ll make a test of pleasure and of having a good time, but alas! This also turned out to be vanity. Of sport, I was led to conclude that it was madness, and of joy\u2014what does it accomplish! I made up my mind to stimulate my body with wine and to pursue folly, in order to ascertain whether this was a good way for the children of men to spend the days of their lives.\n I undertook great works. I acquired houses; I planted vineyards; I made gardens and parks. I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees, I made pools of water to irrigate the sprouting forest. I purchased slaves and handmaidens, and had a household of dependents, besides having possessions of cattle and flocks in large number, more than anyone before me in Jerusalem. I gathered also silver and gold, royal treasures, and provinces; I got singers and dancing maidens and all the delights of the children of men.\n So I became great, in excess of anyone who was before me in Jerusalem. I did not withhold anything that my eyes desired, I did not deny myself any pleasure, for I rejoiced in all my toil, and this was my portion of all my toil. But when I looked on all what my hands had wrought and on what I had toiled for\u2014all indeed seemed vanity and chasing after wind. Nothing seemed worthwhile under the sun.\n So I made a test of madness and folly, for what can any man do who comes after a king beyond what he has already done? And yet it seemed to me that perhaps wisdom  has an advantage over folly, insofar as light is better than darkness. But then I realized that there is one and the same fate for all, and I reflected that the fate of the fool will also overtake me. Why then should I be overwise? I concluded that this also is vanity. For of the wise man, as of the fool, there is no permanent record. In the days to come everything is forgotten. And see how the wise man dies just as the fool!\n So I hated life. All that happened under the sun seemed evil to me since all was vanity and chasing after wind. I hated that I must leave all that I had toiled for under the sun to one who comes after me. A man who toils with wisdom, knowledge, and integrity must hand it over as an inheritance to one who has not toiled for it\u2014surely this is vanity and a great evil. What has a man of all his toil and of his painstaking efforts under the sun, since all his days are pains and his ambition a vexation, with no rest for his mind even at night? Surely this is vanity.\n There is nothing better for a man than to eat and to drink and to enjoy himself for his toil; it seems to me that such is the will of God. Everything has its appointed time, and there is a time for every occurrence under the sun. There is a time to be born, and a time to die. There is a time for planting, and a time for uprooting. What profit, then, has the worker of his toil?\n I have observed every ambition which God has given the children of men for their affliction. He has given them a grasp of the whole world without the possibility on the part of man to fathom the work which God has made from the beginning to the end. I realized that there is nothing better for a man than to be happy and to enjoy himself in his life, and that every man who eats and drinks and has a good time in all his toil enjoys a gift of God. I realized that whatever God does is forever, to which one cannot add and from which one cannot take away. Whatever has been has been before, and what is to be has already been.\n I saw under the sun in the place of justice wickedness, and where the righteous should have been the wicked was. I reflected that God permits this in the case of children of men to test them and to show that they are beasts. For the fate of the children of men and the fate of the beast is the same. As this one dies, so is the death of that, and there is the same spirit to all. Man has no advantage over the beast, for all is vanity. All go to one place. All are of the dust and all return to dust. Who knows whether the spirit of the children of men mounts up and the spirit of the beast goes down? It appeared to me that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy himself. That is his portion\u2014who can help him to see what shall be after him?\n I considered all the oppressions practiced under the sun, and the tears of the oppressed without anyone to console them, and the violence of their oppressors with no comforter in sight! And I praised these long since dead more than those still living; better than both is the one who has not yet been, as he has not seen the evil happenings under the sun. I considered that all toil and all honest work is merely due to man\u2019s zeal against his neighbor\u2014surely this is vanity and chasing after wind. Better a handful in quiet than two handsful in toil and chasing after wind. And I further considered the vanity that there is under the sun. There is a single man without a mate, without a son or brother, yet toiling without end, and with an eye never satisfied by his wealth. For whom then should I toil and deprive myself of a good time? Surely this is vanity and a sorry business.\n Better is the child of humble birth and wise than an old king who is a fool and unable to take care of himself. For through a rebellion one may come to rule, even though one is born poor in one\u2019s own kingdom. I saw all the living under the sun flocking to the side of the child, who was to stand in his place. There was no end to all the people, yet those that come after will not rejoice in him\u2014now surely this is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Observe thy pilgrimages to the house of God but draw nigh to hear, rather than to have fools offer a sacrifice, for they do not know enough to do any harm. Be not rash with thy mouth, and be not led hastily to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and thou art upon earth. Therefore, let thy words be few. If thou  does make a vow to God, do not defer paying it. Whatever thou vows, pay! It is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. Let not thy mouth bring sin upon thee, and do not say before God that it was a slip. Why arouse God\u2019s anger and destroy thy own handiwork?\n A multitude of dreams results in many foolish words, for a dream comes through too much business, and a fool\u2019s voice is heard in many words. If thou sees the oppression of the poor, and justice and righteousness in the country defrauded, do not be amazed at the occurrence, for there is some \u201cguardian\u201d higher up and still higher ones above this one, and overtopping them all is the king.\n  A sore evil that I have seen under the sun is riches hoarded by the owner, and when that fortune is lost through a bad venture, the son begotten by him has nothing. He cannot carry anything that he has acquired by his toil away with him. Surely this  is a sore evil, that just as he came, so he goes. Therefore, what profit is it to him that he toils for the wind and that he spends all his days in saving and in constant worry and sickness and distress?\n It seems to me the thing that is good and proper is to eat, drink, and to have a good time with all one\u2019s toil under the sun during the span of life which God has allotted to one, for that is his portion. Every man to whom God has given riches and possessions and who has the power to enjoy it and to take his portion and to be happy in his toil\u2014this is a gift of God. For he should remember that life is short and that God approves of joy.\n There is an evil I have observed under the sun and it bears heavily on mankind\u2014a man to whom God has given riches and possessions and superfluity with nothing lacking of anything that he might wish for, but to whom God has not given the power to enjoy it, so that a stranger enjoys it\u2014this surely is vanity and a sore evil.\n If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, be his life ever so long, and he does not get his fill of joy out of it\u2014I say that the abortion is happier than he. Even though it comes into vanity, moves in darkness, and with darkness its name is covered and it has never seen the sun nor has known anything\u2014yet this is preferable to the other. And though a man lives a thousand years twice told and has not had a good time\u2014do not all go to one place?\n What advantage has a wise man over a fool, or the poor man who by his knowledge sets an example to the living? Better is enjoyment than longing\u2014though this also is vanity and chasing after wind.\n Whatever is has long since been determined and what is has been fixed. Man cannot contend with what is stronger than himself. Since many possessions merely increase vanity, what advantage are they to man? For who knows what is good for a man during the span of his life of vanity? And though he spends his life like a shadow, is there anyone who can tell man who is to be after him under the sun?\n  1 Sheol is the Hebrew underworld, described in the Bible as \u201cthe land of gloom and deep darkness\u201d (Job 10:21).  \u21a9\n  Read the other entries in our series:  Lewis H. Lapham,  Frederick Douglass,  Virginia Gildersleeve, and  Kurt Vonnegut.\n  Qohelet is the attributed author of Ecclesiastes, an Old Testament book of wisdom literature.

Tech companies now rely on it to categorize people and measure whether products such as facial recognition systems or smartwatch heart-rate sensors perform equally well across skin tones.   read more\n  Critics say FST, which includes four categories for &#34;white&#34; skin and one apiece for &#34;black&#34; and &#34;brown,&#34; disregards diversity among people of color. Researchers at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, during  a federal technology standards conference last October, recommended abandoning FST for evaluating facial recognition because it poorly represents color range in diverse populations.\n In response to Reuters&#39; questions about FST, Google, for the first time and ahead of peers, said that it has been quietly pursuing better measures.\n &#34;We are working on alternative, more inclusive, measures that could be useful in the development of our products, and will collaborate with scientific and medical experts, as well as groups working with communities of color,&#34; the company said, declining to offer details on the effort.\n The controversy is part of a larger reckoning over racism and diversity in the tech industry, where the workforce is more white than in sectors like finance. Ensuring technology works well for all skin colors, as well different ages and genders, is assuming greater importance as new products, often powered by artificial intelligence (AI), extend into sensitive and regulated areas such as healthcare and law enforcement.\n Companies know their products can be faulty for groups that are under-represented in research and testing data. The concern over FST is that its limited scale for darker skin could lead to technology that, for instance, works for golden brown skin but fails for espresso red tones.\n Numerous types of products offer palettes far richer than FST. Crayola last year launched 24 skin tone crayons, and Mattel Inc&#39;s  (MAT.O) Barbie Fashionistas dolls this year cover nine tones.\n The issue is far from academic for Google. When the company announced in February that cameras on some Android phones could measure pulse rates via a fingertip,  it said readings on average would err by 1.8% regardless of whether users had light or dark skin.\n The company later gave  similar warranties that skin type would not noticeably affect results of a feature for filtering backgrounds on Meet video conferences, nor of an upcoming web tool for identifying skin conditions, informally dubbed  Derm Assist.\n    The late Harvard University dermatologist Dr.  Thomas Fitzpatrick invented the scale to personalize ultraviolet radiation treatment for psoriasis, an itchy skin condition. He grouped the skin of &#34;white&#34; people as Roman numerals I to IV by asking how much sunburn or tan they developed after certain periods in sun.\n A decade later came type V for &#34;brown&#34; skin and VI for &#34;black.&#34; The scale is still part of U.S. regulations for testing sunblock products, and it remains a popular dermatology standard for assessing patients&#39; cancer risk and more.\n Some dermatologists say the scale is a poor and overused measure for care, and often conflated with race and ethnicity.\n &#34;Many people would assume I am skin type V, which rarely to never burns, but I burn,&#34; said Dr. Susan Taylor, a University of Pennsylvania dermatologist who founded Skin of Color Society in 2004 to promote research on marginalized communities. &#34;To look at my skin hue and say I am type V does me disservice.&#34;\n Technology companies, until recently, were unconcerned. Unicode, an industry association overseeing emojis, referred to FST in 2014 as its basis for adopting five skin tones beyond yellow,  saying the scale was &#34;without negative associations.&#34;\n A 2018 study titled  &#34;Gender Shades,&#34; which found facial analysis systems more often misgendered people with darker skin, popularized using FST for evaluating AI. The research described FST as a &#34;starting point,&#34; but scientists of similar studies that came later told Reuters they used the scale to stay consistent.\n &#34;As a first measure for a relatively immature market, it serves its purpose to help us identify red flags,&#34; said Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a Mozilla fellow focused on auditing AI.\n In  an April study testing AI for detecting deepfakes, Facebook Inc  (FB.O) researchers wrote FST &#34;clearly does not encompass the diversity within brown and black skin tones.&#34; Still, they released videos of 3,000 individuals to be used for evaluating AI systems, with FST tags attached based on the assessments of eight human raters.\n The judgment of the raters is central. Facial recognition software startup AnyVision last year gave  celebrity examples to raters: former baseball great Derek Jeter as a type IV, model Tyra Banks a V and rapper 50 Cent a VI.\n AnyVision told Reuters it agreed with Google&#39;s decision to revisit use of FST, and Facebook said it is open to better measures.\n Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O) and smartwatch makers Apple Inc  (AAPL.O) and Garmin Ltd  (GRMN.O) reference FST when working on health-related sensors.\n But use of FST could be fueling &#34;false assurances&#34; about heart rate readings from smartwatches on darker skin, University of California San Diego clinicians, inspired by the Black Lives Matter social equality movement,  wrote in the journal Sleep last year.\n Microsoft acknowledged FST&#39;s imperfections.

They dehydrate very quickly.\u201d\n  His wife received an alert on her phone soon after that. The family said their thermostat had been changed remotely, raising the temperature of their home during a three-hour \u201cenergy saving event.\u201d\n  The family\u2019s smart thermostat was installed a few years ago as part of a new home security package. Many smart thermostats can be enrolled in a program called &#34;Smart Savers Texas.&#34; It&#39;s operated by a company called  EnergyHub.\n  The agreement states that in exchange for an entry into sweepstakes, electric customers allow them to control their thermostats during periods of high energy demand. EnergyHub\u2019s list of its clients include TXU Energy, CenterPoint and ERCOT.\n    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want anybody else controlling my things for me,\u201d he said.\n  A scroll through a Houston Reddit board shows English is not alone. Several others said they found out during this week\u2019s heatwave that their thermostats were being accessed, and turned up, remotely.\n    English said his smart thermostat is convenient but said it\u2019s not worth it.\n  \u201cIf somebody else can manipulate this, I\u2019m not for it,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 12:39:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

a face in the rock, like the Old Man on the Mountain famously minted on the New Hampshire quarter? Or perhaps you have seen clouds in the shape of dragons, or the face of Jesus on a piece of burnt toast? If so, you have experienced what psychologists call &#34; pareidolia&#34; \u2014\u00a0finding meaningful images in visual patterns.\n And while the experience of pareidolia is universal, few know that pareidolia is also an indication of\u00a0 creativity\u00a0and a fundamental feature of aesthetic appreciation. Recent scientific research into the neuroscience of &#34;spontaneous thought&#34; suggests that the source of pareidolia may be one of the reasons we love art and nature so much.\n Cognitive fluctuations are unpredictable changes in neural activity in the brain. \u00a0Their causes are presently unknown. Neuroscientists have been aware of these fluctuations since the 1930s, but typically averaged them out as &#34;background noise&#34; from other brain activity correlated to conscious thought.\n Recently, scientists have come to believe that so-called background noise in the brain may be more crucial to consciousness than previously thought. Recent research found that these fluctuations make up 95% of brain activity; conscious thoughts account for merely 5%. Cognitive fluctuations are like the dark matter or &#34;junk&#34; DNA of the brain, in that they make up the most significant part of what&#39;s happening but remain mysterious.\n Neuroscientists such as\u00a0 Georg Northoff,\u00a0 Robin Carhart-Harris, and\u00a0 Stanislas Dehaene\u00a0have been focusing their research on these fluctuations in the last fifteen years. They have concluded that neural fluctuations are not secondary, but fundamental for consciousness. Using technologies that measure the frequency and strength of large groups of neural fluctuations in the brain, scientists have discovered that brain waves tend to nest into one another, like syncopation in music. At the lowest frequencies, the drums lay down a beat, and the bass plays a rhythm. In between the notes of that rhythm, the guitar plays a melody. The song of consciousness builds up from spontaneous neural fluctuations.\n There are similar spontaneous fluctuations in the world, our bodies, and our brains. When sensory information from the world interacts with the brain, it creates unique &#34;diffractive&#34; patterns, similar to the colliding waves made by stones dropped into a pool of water. The world pulses with frequencies of sound and light like a drumbeat within which our bodies digest food, beat hearts, and pump lungs.\n Our brains do not represent the world, but rather respond to this stimuli with their own spontaneous fluctuations. They play between the waves with melodies that make up our thoughts and feelings. Like a jazz trio, the world, body, and brain have their own spontaneous fluctuations that are the basis of the creative improvisation we call reality.\n These fluctuations are also the source of our experience of\u00a0 pareidolia. When we let our minds wander and daydream, they become increasingly open to these divergent &#34;bottom-up&#34; diffractions and weak associations. Pareidolia occurs when our brains involuntarily experiment with seeing various &#34;top-down&#34; images such as animal shapes or faces in these fluctuations. In this improvisational state of mind, spontaneous thoughts and creative images rise like waves from the ocean of the unconscious and disappear\u00a0 again. This back-and-forth is an improvisational process that increases cognitive fluctuations in the brain and has\u00a0 therapeutic\u00a0effects similar to other\u00a0 activities\u00a0that increase\u00a0 cognitive flux.\n But why do we enjoy this state of being so much? Why do we prefer some plants, or some works of art, over others? Some sights and sounds tend to amplify these spontaneous fluctuations and others do not. For instance, scientists have shown that taking a walk outdoors tends to increase mind-wandering due to certain\u00a0 patterns\u00a0in nature called fractals. The same thing happens when we view these patterns and proportions in\u00a0 art. A fractal is a particular repeating coarse-grained to fine-grain pattern, such as a tree whose forking patterns  repeat in its branches, twigs, and leaf veins.\n When we look at the world, our unconscious eye movements or &#34;eye saccades&#34; also have a fractal pattern as they move over\u00a0 images. When we view fractal patterns with our fractal eye movements, our bodies become\u00a0 less stressed, and we mind-wander more as images emerge and disappear from conscious awareness. Even our brainwaves become more fractal and more interconnected when our minds\u00a0 wander. And this experience of reverie tends to feel good.\n  Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon&#39;s weekly newsletter  The Vulgar Scientist.\n  For instance, several recent studies have shown that people prefer to look at fractal patterns and artworks more than non-fractal ones and find them more aesthetically\u00a0 beautiful. Fractal images and sounds invite our eyes, bodies, and brains to play, wander, and make new associations at a mainly unconscious and involuntary level. We enjoy it even if when we do not consciously know why.\n As you might guess, fractals also increase pareidolia. Studies show that people tend to see more images in Rorschach ink-blot tests with a particular fractal\u00a0 dimension.\n But why is the play between body, brain, and world so widely experienced as pleasurable and beautiful? The physicist, Richard Taylor at the University of Oregon, speculates that humans are &#34;wired&#34; with a &#34; fractal fluency&#34; because we evolved surrounded by the natural fractal patterns of plants, clouds, and rocks. Studies confirm that fractals increase attention, pattern recognition, navigation, reduce stress, and have aesthetic appeal. Taylor argues fractals are also the source of our &#34;biophilia,&#34; or love of nature.\n What I find fascinating about the interrelation between cognitive fluctuations, mind wandering, and fractal patterns in art and nature is that they tend to be good for us in a uniquely\u00a0 playful\u00a0way. Nature does not dictate a single universal form of right action, healthy living, or beautiful art. Instead, some patterns let us play and experiment more or less. And it seems that our bodies prefer to play.\n But play can also be dangerous. Not all our experiments work, and some go wrong. Mind-wandering can lead to negative rumination, and not everyone prefers the same fractal aesthetics.\n But here is the takeaway: we are not biologically programmed to like or this or that object, but rather inclined to enjoy the process of play, improvisation, trial, and error in all things. In other words, recent research into mind wandering and fractals suggests that the process of creativity and unconscious play involved in making and experiencing art is a crucial source of aesthetic beauty and our love of nature.\n       Thomas Nail is Professor of Philosophy at the  University of Denver and author of numerous books and articles, some of which\u00a0can be read online\u00a0 here.

2000s, people think they know the story of Paris Hilton. So, when the 40-year-old released a YouTube documentary about her life last year, many were shocked to learn about her decades-long struggle with trauma.\n Hilton tearfully recounted how she was woken up by strangers in her bedroom in the middle of the night as a teenager and forcibly taken across the country. She said her unanswered cries for help repeatedly play out in nightmares which make it difficult to sleep.\n Her story, though shocking, is not unique. Hilton is one of thousands of American children sent every year by their parents into a private network of &#34;tough love&#34; residential programmes and schools marketed at reforming their behaviour.\n   &#34;My parents got me kidnapped and dropped off in the middle of the mountains,&#34; 21-year-old Daniel says in a TikTok video watched more than a million times.\n As a teenager, Daniel suffered anxiety and depression. He was 15 and had recently come out as gay when he self-harmed so severely that he required hospital care. It was in hospital that he was shaken awake in the middle of the night by two men. They told him the process could be easy or hard - depending on how much he resisted. With little fight left in him, Daniel went with the pair. But when he asked a stranger if he could use a telephone to call his parents on a brief stop for food, he says the escorts threatened him with handcuffs.\n  Daniel was sent to a wilderness programme in Utah where he spent 77 days living outdoors, hiking miles a day on rations. He vividly remembers feeling cold, hungry and dirty for weeks on end and witnessing others attempt to run away and try to take their own lives. Like many others sent to wilderness programmes, he was then enrolled directly into a long-term facility - this time in Montana - where he would spend another 15 months.\n  The Troubled Teen Industry (TTI) has become an umbrella term for a wide scope of private residential programmes like these aimed at modifying adolescent behaviour. From boot camps to boarding schools, these facilities are marketed as treatment for a broad range of behavioural and mental health issues including eating disorders, drug use and defiance.\n The people who took Hilton and Daniel were from companies specially marketed to families concerned about how their children might react to being enrolled in a programme. These youth transportation services are well-advertised and often come recommended, with parents typically paying a few thousand dollars to have their children taken from their beds and securely dropped off across the country.\n Parents are sometimes referred to the industry by third parties after feeling they have exhausted other means of getting their children help. Programmes sell themselves on high levels of anecdotal success, with testimonials from families and students on their marketing materials and in online reviews describing them as transformative and even life-saving.\n But for years, other former residents have been painting a very different picture of their time within these facilities, including in lawsuits and criminal complaints, alleging emotional and physical abuse.\n  The BBC has spoken to 20 people who identify as troubled teen survivors, aged from 20 to their late 40s, about their experiences within the industry over the last few decades.\n  Although their individual backgrounds and reasons for being sent away differ, patterns emerge across their accounts and the hundreds more shared in TTI survivor support networks online.\n The size of the industry and its yearly turnover of teenagers across the US remains elusive because there is no federal regulator monitoring it.\n   The US Government Accountability Office was tasked with investigating allegations of neglect and abuse across the industry in 2007, but found it difficult to grasp the national picture due to irregular licensing rules at the state level and ambiguity surrounding the labels facilities use to describe themselves - like boot camps or therapeutic boarding schools.\n Their investigators found thousands of allegations of abuse and examined a number of deaths at behavioural programmes across the US and in American-owned businesses operating abroad. Their reports raised concerns about the level of training required of staff as well as what they described as deceptive and questionable marketing practices aimed at parents.\n  Cynthia Clark Harvey was one of them. Her daughter Erica was just 15 when she died of heatstroke and dehydration on her first full day in a wilderness programme in Nevada in 2002.\n  Cynthia remembers her daughter as a bright, thoughtful and athletic young girl who had always done well academically until she began suffering from mental health problems aged 14. Her struggles led her to become suicidal and begin experimenting with illegal drugs. When Erica was admitted to hospital and excluded from school, the family felt frightened and out of their depth.\n   At the time, the situation felt drastic. Erica had been doing better but her psychiatrist recommended that residential treatment could help her path to recovery.\n The programme her family chose was well-known and accredited. They felt reassured Erica was in safe hands and would grow from the experience. After weeks of deliberation and planning, they travelled to Nevada under the guise of a family trip with her younger sister. When the deception was revealed, Erica became scared and angry and refused to get out of the car. After a turbulent hours-long group therapy session with other families, she and the other children were taken away.\n This was the last time Cynthia and her husband ever saw their daughter alive. By the time they got back home to Arizona the following evening, there was already a message waiting on their answering phone telling them to call. They were told Erica had an accident and staff were performing CPR.\n &#34;I don&#39;t remember the time frame, but at that point she probably had been dead already for quite some time,&#34; Cynthia says.\n   Erica&#39;s obituary could only say that she died hiking in Nevada. Her parents would not find out her cause of death for weeks - and it took years and a lawsuit for them to get records and find out the truth of what happened that day.\n Cynthia says they eventually settled with the programme for an undisclosed amount on the condition they could speak freely about the circumstances of their daughter&#39;s death. She learned Erica had been pushed to keep hiking as her condition worsened throughout the day. She later testified to Congress about how her daughter&#39;s distress had been mistaken for teenage belligerence by staff. Even after Erica fell off the trail into brush and rocks, she did not receive medical help for almost an hour.\n The remote location of the trek and a series of blunders in calling help to their location meant it took hours more for an emergency helicopter to arrive and take her to hospital where she was officially declared dead, long past the point her life could have been saved.\n Cynthia continues to grapple with regret and grief over what happened and came to connect with other parents who found themselves in the same unimaginable position. No criminal charges were ever filed over her daughter&#39;s death but 19 years on, Cynthia continues to speak publicly in favour of industry-wide reform.\n The National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs (Natsap) - the largest membership association of its kind - appeared on behalf of the industry in the congressional hearings, where it was grilled by lawmakers about the protections and checks in place.\n Natsap&#39;s website today says it and the industry have changed over time. It emphasises that it has ethical standards in place and requires members to be licensed by their appropriate state agency or a national accrediting body and have therapeutic services overseen by a qualified clinician, though it does not accredit facilities themselves.\n Campaigners argue that current levels of oversight are not enough. They say the lack of cohesive national monitoring has allowed bad actors to move around the industry and can enable facilities to rebrand under new names and distance themselves from complaints.\n In online networks they have built, people who identify as survivors of the industry connect and offer support across the country - pooling information and resources to track alleged abuses and a revolving door of programmes and staff. One Reddit forum on the topic has more than 20,000 members alone.\n   While a number of the more controversial programmes and organisations have closed down in recent years, allegations continue to plague the industry. A lot of the stories and experiences former residents recounted to the BBC had a lot in common - whether they got out decades ago or within the last couple of years.\n Many described arrival processes that left them feeling degraded and dehumanised. Those taken by transport companies described the process as disorienting and frightening. Some, including sex abuse victims, complained of invasive strip searches and examinations. One person, who was sent due to struggles with depression stemming from gender dysphoria, recounted undergoing a smear test as a virgin aged 14. Others described having their heads shaved and having blood and drugs testing despite having no history of substance abuse themselves.\n   Some claim to have witnessed and experienced practices like isolation and restraint and say they were also expected to punish and restrain others. Many of the systems they described were based on levels where active participation, including in &#34;attack therapy&#34; sessions where group members are expected to confront and criticise one another, was required to progress and gain basic privileges. Others described arbitrary physical labour, collective punishments and periods of mandated silence which could last weeks.\n They all described repressive environments with extreme limits and censorship of their contact with the outside world. Many believe their parents were misled about the reality of the programmes they enrolled them in, and describe rules that seeded mistrust between them and their families. Some recounted ongoing damage to relationships and enduring fears of opening up about their experiences, even after leaving, for fear of being sent back or not being believed.\n Some told the BBC they witnessed physical violence, self-harm and suicide attempts and many know other residents who took their own lives after leaving. Others have subsequently been diagnosed with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder and say they continue to suffer long-term social difficulties, including in trusting in others, because of their experience.\n  In 2006, journalist Maia Szalavitz wrote a book that urged parents to seek evidence-based treatment for children instead of resorting to behavioural modification facilities. Her book traces the origins of many of the methods used in the industry, including confrontational group therapy, to controversial and discredited programmes from decades ago.\n Advocates for change say the teenage &#34;tough love&#34; industry, which first began to take off in the 1980s, has been able to endure decades of controversy in part because of social stigma surrounding the issues why parents seek help. It is not uncommon for teenagers to spend years within the system and monthly tuition, sometimes in the thousands, can mount up fast.\n Many, including Szalavitz, believe those referring families can exploit or exaggerate fears children will end up dead or incarcerated because of issues like drug abuse. Both her and Dr Kate Truitt, a clinical psychologist and neuroscientist who works with former residents, say the trauma experienced at these facilities can actually perpetuate or lead to long-term battles with addiction and abusive relationships.\n Many ex-residents, including some the BBC spoke to, say they initially viewed their treatment as justified and even advocated for others to send their children. Some took years to change their opinion of their programme after they reflected on their experiences.\n   Dr Truitt compares the trauma she has seen in some former residents to that experienced by former members of cults or prisoners of war. She points out that their experiences can be particularly damaging as adolescence is such a critical time for development.\n &#34;And because of the type of specific trauma they&#39;ve endured, most survivors don&#39;t feel safe seeking out treatment, because the people who were the treatment providers are the perpetrators,&#34; she tells the BBC.\n  Paris Hilton revealed she had already run away from a number of other placements before she was taken to Provo Canyon in Utah and kept for almost a year before she turned 18.\n The documentary This is Paris shows her reuniting with classmates as they go public with their ongoing trauma from alleged experiences of emotional and physical abuse there, including allegations of punishments like solitary confinement.\n  Provo Canyon remains open. A statement pinned to the top of their website says it was sold to new owners in 2000 and it cannot comment on operations or patient experiences before this time. They also say they do not use methods like seclusion or mechanical restraint now.\n Hilton&#39;s documentary has been watched almost 30 million times and she has continued vocal advocacy since its release.\n This role marks a drastic departure from the persona she built her celebrity brand and business empire around. Although her teenage history was already known among those who went through the same systems, they say having someone as high-profile come forward has helped bring credibility and awareness to the issue.\n People within the community say the documentary has empowered some to speak out about their experience for the first time. or has been used to help others, including parents, understand what they went through.\n   Some former residents have united under the idea of #BreakingCodeSilence, in reference to the periods of mandated social isolation used as a punishment and as a method of control in some facilities.\n &#34;One of the rules in many of these programmes is that you couldn&#39;t take anyone&#39;s phone number or name when you left. So, we were never meant to connect,&#34; Katherine McNamara, who went to Provo with Hilton, says about the groups that have emerged on social media. She and some others are now working together on a non-profit to help raise awareness, support those who identify as survivors and advocate for change.\n Other celebrities, including Paris Jackson and tattoo artist Kat von D, have been inspired by the documentary to come forward.\n Rapper Bhad Bhabie, real name Danielle Bregoli, has called for television personality Dr Phil to apologise for sending her and other teenagers to troubled teen facilities on his popular US show.\n It came after another former guest filed a lawsuit alleging she had been punished for reporting an alleged sexual assault by a staff member at the same therapeutic boarding ranch Bregoli was sent to. The facility, which the BBC contacted for a response, has previously denied the allegations against it and disputed their accounts.\n Phil McGraw said in an interview he was sad to hear of Bregoli&#39;s alleged bad experience but distanced himself and his show from her claims.\n  Younger people, once isolated from their teenage peers because of their experience, are using social media to try and break the stigma. Some have gained huge followings on platforms like TikTok from telling their stories. But none of this is not without personal risk - the BBC has seen legal letters sent to one content creator after they spoke publicly.\n Daniel has gained more than 240,000 followers and millions of likes since he started telling his and other people&#39;s stories last year. He now gets dozens of messages every day from others who went through similar situations and has had parents contact him to say they&#39;ve reconsidered plans to send their children away after seeing his videos.\n &#34;If my 15-year-old self knew that people were out there fighting for me, I would have felt so relieved,&#34; he says about the movement.\n  In some cases, social media has been a tool for tangible change. One woman, Amanda Householder, used TikTok to spread awareness of allegations surrounding her parents&#39; treatment of girls at a religious boarding ranch they were running in Missouri. Millions viewed her videos and eventually officials closed the school.\n   Householder testified to end religious exemptions in the state of Missouri that stopped even basic oversight of conditions at private religious facilities like the one her parents ran. She described the experience to the BBC as &#34;very cathartic\u2026 knowing that maybe in the future kids won&#39;t have to go through what we went through&#34; and says she hopes to give evidence in their criminal case.\n Hilton was part of a group who spoke at a hearing to convince lawmakers to introduce better protections in Utah - the state thought to have the biggest density of troubled teen facilities in the US.\n &#34;I don&#39;t know if my nightmares will ever go away, but I do know that there are hundreds of thousands of kids going through this, and maybe if I stop their nightmares, it will help me stop mine,&#34; she testified.\n    But a spokesperson for Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff&#39;s office confirmed to the BBC that he is working to update and re-introduce legislation aimed at prohibiting and ending abuse at residential treatment centres and increasing national oversight of such facilities.\n   &#34;It doesn&#39;t get better as the years go on, because it&#39;s just more milestones that go by,&#34; Cynthia reflects.\n It&#39;s been well over a decade since she took part in hearings pushing for federal regulation.

and a &#34;parody&#34;\n Adelaide woman Tanya Watkins, a self-described &#34;captain&#34; of the church and\u00a0adherent of its creed of &#34;Pastafarianism&#34;, has made repeated attempts to secure the offbeat movement official status as\u00a0an incorporated association.\n After the latest attempt was knocked back by the Corporate Affairs Commission, Ms Watkins\u00a0sought a review of that decision, and the matter was subsequently referred to the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT).\n The tribunal heard evidence from the commission and from Ms Watkins, who contended that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was formed for a &#34;religious, educational, charitable or benevolent purpose&#34;, thereby meeting the criteria of South Australia&#39;s\u00a0Associations Incorporation Act.\n Ms Watkins told the tribunal the church placed emphasis on helping others, and\u00a0had engaged in acts of charity\u00a0such as an event at Flinders University\u00a0to &#34;feed the hungry&#34;.\n In a ruling handed down earlier this year, and recently published online, SACAT Senior Member Kathleen McEvoy rejected the arguments\u00a0for incorporation.\n &#34;Ms Watkins explained to the tribunal that she was seeking incorporation for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Australia in order that the association would be recognised as a not for profit organisation under the Act, and be a legal entity in its own right,&#34; Ms McEvoy stated.\n In the ruling, Ms McEvoy noted that while various &#34;Pastafarian texts&#34; are set out in traditional religious forms, they &#34;contain some surprising articulations&#34;, such as references to the books of the Bible as the &#34;Old Testicle&#34; and &#34;New Testicle&#34;.\n &#34;In particular there are numerous expressions which reference the texts of established religions, mimicking those texts in form and language, but in a clearly parodic form,&#34; Ms McEvoy wrote.\n &#34;I do not accept the applicant&#39;s\u00a0explanation of the use of these expressions (and numerous other similar expressions, many expressed in racist and sexist terms, referencing texts or practices of other religions) as examples of humour, and for the purpose of generating curiosity.&#34;\n  &#34;It is my view that the Pastafarian texts can only be read as parody or satire , namely,  an imitation of work made for comic effect. In my view, its purpose is to satirise or mock established religions, and it does so without discrimination,&#34; she wrote.\n  Ms McEvoy upheld the\u00a0Corporate Affairs Commission&#39;s decision that there was no evidence the church engaged in &#34;systematic teaching and learning processes, nor of any structured, consistent, and broad-based charitable activities&#34;.\n &#34;I am satisfied that the proposed incorporated association merely presents as having a religious purpose, but is a sham religion or a parody of religion,&#34; she wrote.\n &#34;It was not formed for a religious purpose. On this basis, to conclude it is eligible for incorporation as a body with a religious purpose could clearly not be a preferable decision.&#34;\n Ms Watkins told the ABC she found SACAT&#39;s decision &#34;quite disappointing&#34;, and said incorporation would have brought considerable benefits.\n &#34;If you&#39;ve got an association, then you should get it incorporated because then you&#39;ve got government oversight, you can run a bank account and all those sorts of things so we could be transparent and above board,&#34; she said.\n Ms Watkins rejected claims that the church was a &#34;sham&#34; and a &#34;hoax&#34;, which she said came &#34;from a misunderstanding&#34;.\n She said the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\u00a0would continue to operate as an\u00a0unincorporated body.\n &#34;You&#39;ll find that there is a core group of people who really believe in Pastafarianism and that it can change people&#39;s lives for the better,&#34;

", "note_en": "Today&#39;s selection -- from  How to Invent Everything by Ryan North. If you should get transported back to pre-history, here\u2019s how to tan an animal skin:\n &#34;Tanning was originally invented in 7000 BCE. Without tanning, animal skins quickly rot, and even dried ones become hard, inflexible, and brittle. Tanning transforms these skins into leather: a substance so resistant to rot that leather shoes from 3500 BCE have survived into the modern era. It&#39;s something you&#39;ll definitely want to do, but you should keep in mind that preparing animal skins for tanning involves not only skin fermentation but also soaking them in urine and massaging them in poop slurries, so maybe set up your tanneries downwind.\n &#34;Immediately after slaughtering the animals, lay the skins flat and cover the fleshy side in salt or sand, which will dry them out and delay decomposi\u00adtion. In a few days the hides will become hard and almost crispy, and they can then be transported to your tanning area. Once there, you&#39;ll soak the hides: this cleans off dirt and gore and softens them up again. Scour the skins to remove any remaining flesh, then soak them in urine -- this loosens the hair, which can then be scraped off. You&#39;ll make the poop slurry we advertised earlier by mixing poo and water, and then soak your skins in that: enzymes in the poop will cause the skins to ferment, softening them and making them more flexible. You can help this process by standing in your poop slurry and kneading the skins with your feet -- just keep telling yourself you&#39;re crushing grapes -- but be sure to wash up with soap and water afterward, or better yet use nonhuman power (like a waterwheel) to knead the skins for you.\n &#34;After all this, two things will have happened: your animal skins will be soft, flexible, and ready for tanning, and nobody will want to get anywhere near you.\n &#34;To tan these skins, you&#39;ll need to collect some appropriately named &#39;tannins,&#39; which come from trees containing the equally appropriately named &#39;tannic acid.&#39; The bark from oak, chestnut, hemlock, and mangrove trees is high in tannin, as is the wood of cedar trees, redwood trees, and more. Tannins are brown, so if you&#39;re using wood instead of bark, look for red- or brown-colored wood, and keep in mind that hardwoods generally contain more tannin than softwoods. To extract tannins, shred your wood or bark and boil it in water for several hours. If you&#39;ve produced it already, adding baking soda to your water will make it more basic, which will draw out the tannins more effectively. You can repeat this process several times with the same bark to produce more dilute tannic solutions.\n &#34;After all this, the tanning process is actually the easiest part: just stretch the animal skins out and immerse them in your tannic solutions of gradually increasing concentrations for a few weeks. During this process, the stretched-out skins trade their moisture for tannins, altering the hide&#39;s protein structure to make it more flexible, more resistant to rotting, and water resistant. And that&#39;s it: you&#39;ve produced leather! Leather&#39;s useful not just for cool jackets; it&#39;s also for shoes, boots (you can make both entirely out of leather), harnesses, boats, can\u00adteens (leather can hold water without leaking, and it won&#39;t break when you drop it like pottery does), whips (fun fact: a whip-crack is actually the sound of a small sonic boom when the tip of the whip exceeds the speed of sound, so technically you&#39;re already inventing supersonic technology), and protective armor.\n &#34;If you prepare your skin but don&#39;t tan it, you&#39;ll produce rawhide, which soft\u00adens when wet but which has the useful property of hardening and contracting when dry. You can exploit that for binding: to attach a blade to a stick and make an ax, just wrap a strip of wet rawhide securely around both and let it dry. Besides making a delicious treat for your dogs (which we can only assume you&#39;ve already started breeding...), rawhide is useful in making drum skins, lampshades, and primitive horseshoes, and has\u00a0 even been used for casts. If you&#39;re doing that, though, be sure to leave some room for it to contract: wrapping limbs in too-tight rawhide has been used for torture. That&#39;s right: while rawhide contracting around hands and feet won&#39;t produce enough pressure to break bones, it will produce enough pressure to move those bones to places they don&#39;t normally go.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:55:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u52a8\u7269,animal,\u76ae\u80a4", "title": "\u6652\u9ed1\u52a8\u7269\u76ae\u80a4 ", "title_en": "Tanning an Animal Skin", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.delanceyplace.com/view-archives.php?4351", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a8\u7269", "animal", "\u76ae\u80a4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "84d43a86d7f453d06fe4fb5dfb1f2e92.jpg", "infoid": 1066829, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ee3\u8868Revlon\u7684\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e3aRevlon\uff06\uff0339;\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u63d0\u4ea4780\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5229\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u53d1\u9001\u4e868.93\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 - \u8d37\u6b3e\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u4f59\u989d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f2023\u5e74\u3002\n \u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u62ff\u56de\u94b1\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u62d2\u7edd\u4e86\uff0c\u8ba9\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u7ea65\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6848\u4ef6\u53bb\u4e86\u5ba1\u5224\uff0c\u672c\u5468\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5c0f\u533a\u6cd5\u5b98\u5728\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u7edf\u6cbb\u7740\u82b1\u65d7\u96c6\u56e2\u7684Jesse Furman\u3002\n \u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u8bef\u5417\uff1f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd8\u6b3e\u5b89\u6392\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u5757\u540d\u4e3aFlexCube\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6267\u884c\u3002\u5f17\u66fc\u6cd5\u5b98\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\uff1a\n  \u5728FlexCube\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684\uff08\u6216\u8bb8\u53ea\u662f\uff09\u6267\u884c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u652f\u4ed8Angelo Gordon\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u4efd\u989d\u622a\u81f32020\u5e748\u670811\u65e5\u622a\u81f38\u670811\u65e5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c062016\u5e74\u671f\u9650\u8d37\u6b3e\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u8d37\u6b3e\u4eba\u91cd\u7ec4 - \u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u5165\u5b83\uff0c\u4eff\u4f5b\u5168\u90e8\u652f\u4ed8\u8d37\u6b3e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e6\u53d1\u5e94\u8ba1\u7684\u5229\u606f\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u8d37\u65b9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u5411A\uff06\uff0334;\u6d17\u8d26\u6237\uff06\uff0334;

Instead they accidentally sent  $893 million--the entire balance of the loan, which was not due until 2023.\n When they realized their mistake, they tried to get the money back. Some of the lenders refused, leaving Citigroup out of roughly $500 million. The case went to trial, and  this week U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled against Citigroup.\n How could an error like this possibly happen? Terrible, terrible UI design, as it turns out. First off we need to understand the mechanisms of the repayment arrangement, which is executed through a piece of financial software called Flexcube. As Judge Furman summarized:\n  On Flexcube, the easiest (or perhaps only) way to execute the transaction\u2014to pay the Angelo Gordon Lenders their share of the principal and interim interest owed as of August 11, 2020, and then to reconstitute the 2016 Term Loan with the remaining Lenders\u2014was to enter it in the system as if paying off the loan in its entirety, thereby triggering accrued interest payments to all Lenders, but to direct the principal portion of the payment to a &#34;wash account&#34;\u2014&#34;an internal Citibank account... to help ensure that money does not leave the bank.&#34;\n Ars Technica got ahold of a screenshot used in the case, which shows where the screw-up occurred:\n The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India. He was presented with a Flexcube screen that looked like this:\n   The subcontractor thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, the subcontractor actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; The subcontractor didn&#39;t do that.\n Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was the subcontractor, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware. All three believed that setting the &#34;principal&#34; field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, the Delaware supervisor wrote: &#34;looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.&#34;\n  It looked &#34;good&#34; to the senior supervisor because there are no design provisions to make it look bad. You would think, where an error of this magnitude was possible, the software designers would group certain buttons together, provide warning prompts, change colors from green to red, or a combination of these things. Instead the program appears to have been designed by an engineer in the &#39;90s.\n The upshot for you UI designers out there: Banks will certainly be looking for better software in the future, and willing to pay top dollar for it. There&#39;s a real opportunity here.\n      They&#39;ll actually just continue paying as little as humanly possible for disposable offshore contractors because that&#39;s what American banks do.\n  What else should we sub out? ooh, Let&#39;s subcontract the management of our heart beating to a company in India while we&#39;re at it. And yes, what a horrible software UI, however, most industrial software interfaces look like1993 and run on terrifyingly open systems and on 10 plus-year-old Operating Systems.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa and Mastercard transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.\n  The strategic shift reflects PayPal\u2019s growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.\n The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.\n \u201cWe are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,\u201d Dan Leberman, PayPal\u2019s senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.\n    PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.\n The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.\n PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.\n It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.\n \u201cPayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.\u201d\n  Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.\n In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.\n Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.\n \u201cWe think it\u2019s a bold price to come out with,\u201d he said.\n As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.\n  The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc in 2015.\n Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with Square Inc.\n For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.\n PayPal\u2019s business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. It processed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than just pricing,\u201d said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. \u201cThey are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:13:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4ea4\u6613,\u4ea7\u54c1,increase,paypal", "title": "PayPal\u5c06\u4f7f\u7f8e\u56fd\u5356\u65b9\u7684\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u52303.49\uff05\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fd0\u8f93\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e0a\u6da80.49\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ece2.9\uff05\u52a0\u4e0a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ea4\u66130.30\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "PayPal will increase US sellers' costs to 3.49% plus $0.49 per transaction on its payment products starting Aug. 2, up from 2.9% plus $0.30 on most transactions", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-rates-idUSKCN2DU1V4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u4ea4\u6613", "\u4ea7\u54c1", "increase", "paypal"]}]
