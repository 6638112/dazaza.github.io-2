Without the authorization of copyright holders, this shadow library hosts and makes more than 2 million scholarly publications, monographs, and textbooks available. This paper analyzes a set of weblogs of one of the Library Genesis mirrors, provided to us by one of the service\u2019s administrators. We reconstruct the social and economic factors that drive the global and European demand for illicit scholarly literature. In particular, we test if lower income regions can compensate for the shortcomings in legal access infrastructures by more intensive use of illicit open resources. We found that while richer regions are the most intensive users of shadow libraries, poorer regions face structural limitations that prevent them from fully capitalizing on freely accessible knowledge.  We discuss these findings in the wider context of open access publishing, and point out that open access knowledge, if not met with proper knowledge absorption infrastructures, has limited usefulness in addressing knowledge access and production inequalities.\n           Bod\u00f3, Bal\u00e1zs and Antal, Daniel and Puha, Zoltan, Open Access is not a Panacea, even if it\u2019s Radical \u2013 an Empirical Study on the Role of Shadow Libraries in Closing the Inequality of Knowledge Access.

"note_en": "The motorhome seems like a great idea until you have to actually drive it somewhere. As it turns out, the car and the house don&#39;t have enough in common to be the best fit. But what about a house and a helicopter\u2014what is the latter if not an airborne box that can be filled with the comforts of home? I guess that was the thought behind the Winnebago Heli-Home, a real flying RV that was actually marketed and sold by Winnebago in the late 1970s.  A pretty perfect idea for vacations in 2020, too.\n I would like to begin by saying that it&#39;s unfortunate Winnebago didn&#39;t actually try to make an existing RV model fly a la  Eagle 5 in  Spaceballs , but reality has its stubborn limits. Instead, beginning in 1975 it worked with a company called Orlando Helicopter Airways to acquire a fleet of ex-military Siksorky S-55 transport helicopters (also known as the H-19) and convert these surplus machines into something a little more homey.\n  And that didn&#39;t mean slapping down carpet and a few folding beds. It meant amenities like hot and cold water, a 6,000 BTU air conditioner, 40,000 BTU furnace for heat, a full bathroom with a shower, a TV, a kitchen, a 3,500-watt generator,  and more. So much more, actually, that the six people Winnebago claimed the Heli-Home could sleep would&#39;ve been living a life of comfort and convenience anywhere they decided to land\u2014and I do mean anywhere.\n In addition to the standard landing gear, the Heli-Home could be obtained with optional floats. That meant you could forget the trouble of having to find a narrow clearing in the woods to land. You could just set right down on a lake and drop anchor. I&#39;m not sure how much time I would want to spend with five other people inside a cramped helicopter that&#39;s anchored in the middle of a lake, but then again I&#39;ve never tried it. Perhaps 115 square feet feels bigger when there&#39;s no property tax.\n  As far as engines went, you could&#39;ve had an 800 horsepower piston-driven model, or a slightly larger 1,525 hp turbine-driven variant. That piston engine burned a lot of fuel and limited its range to around 300 miles, so it wasn&#39;t exactly the &#34;fly deep into the wilderness&#34; experience it might look like unless you hopscotched between airports on your way into the bush.\n The real sticky issue with this whole Heli-Home concept is not the engines or range, however. It&#39;s the price. Even a base model would run you around $880,000 in today&#39;s money, and a top of the line version was $1.4 million when adjusted for inflation.\n But Winnebago figured this might be the case, so for $10,000 a week it would rent you a Heli-Home, assuming you could provide enough additional cash to hire a pilot, and pay for the fuel, of course. However, this rental scheme was not enough to save the idea. All in all, the company would go on to sell only 8 Heli-Homes to customers, none of which survive today.\n  Still, it was hardly a failure. That such an audacious plan made it off the drawing board and into the sky at all is pretty incredible, let alone selling a few.

"note_en": "First launched in 2016, TradeDepot has built up a network of 40,000 small businesses in Nigeria and connects them to local distributors of global consumer brands like Nestl\u00e9,  Unilever,   GB Foods and Danone, according to a statement.\n The initial business model managed to attract a $3 million investment led by  Partech   back in 2018. And now,  as the firm invests from its largest African fund, Partech returned to co-lead TradeDepot\u2019s latest round with the International Finance Corp., Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative and MSA Capital.\n  TradeDepot\u2019s business depends on making a range of household supplies like milk, soap, and detergent more accessible and affordable for the street-side vendors and small shops that provide goods and services for hundreds of communities in cities like Lagos \u2014 where the company is headquartered.\n Using the company\u2019s mobile apps on  Android   or Whatsapp, USSD short code messaging or a toll-free phone number, retailers can place orders and have goods and services delivered through TradeDepot\u2019s fleet of vans and tricycles. They can make payments, order stock, and manage inventory online or through the app as well.\n For consumer brands, they have a central hub through which to distribute directly to vendors on the continent, along with data that can help them manage their relationship with these small vendors.\n  \u201c Africa\u2019s offline retail market is estimated at $1 trillion, and this new investment allows us to capture an even greater segment of that market,\u201d said Onyekachi Izukanne, in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to use data to drive efficiencies and provide an easier stock acquisition service for our [over] 40,000 retailers, driving down costs for them by negotiating even better deals with our global manufacturing partners, whilst simultaneously providing a better, faster route to market for our suppliers.\u201d\n The company said that a new store comes online to use its services every three minutes and that the company receives an order from retailers every four seconds, on average.\n Now, with the new capital, TradeDepot will expand into a suite of financial services and lending products for its retailers. Many of the company\u2019s customers lack a credit rating, but TradeDepot has alternative ways to score credit based on the data it has from its existing trading relationships.\n \u201cThe founders\u2019 vision to build a digital platform that improves the unit economics of serving the mass market is one we feel privileged to support,\u201d said Wale Ayeni, the head of Africa Venture Capital investment at the IFC.\n That support disproportionately goes to helping women entrepreneurs, according to the company. Women account for over 75% of the retailers on the company\u2019s platform. Now, with the help of its new investor We-Fi, TradeDepot will look to offer mentorship opportunities and link these business owners to global markets.\n \u201cWomen play a pivotal role in driving economies across Africa, but lack of access to capital, limited market linkages, cultural norms and other challenges often prevent them from achieving the success they want,\u201d saiid Hanh Nam Nguyen, who represents the We-Fi initiative with the IFC. \u201cWe-Fi financing will incentivize TradeDepot to build stronger women-led small and medium enterprises (SME) retailer and distributor networks, which will support them to become drivers of economic growth in their communities.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-14 15:11:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

"note_en": "Microsoft and Samsung today announced a global partnership to transform the real estate development and property management industries. This new collaboration involves Microsoft\u2019s Azure IoT platform and productivity cloud services and Samsung\u2019s smart devices and SmartThings platform. Both the companies will help organizations around the world to optimize building operations, equipment maintenance, energy management, asset performance, and more.\n  The companies will leverage Samsung\u2019s smart home appliances, HVAC systems and smart TVs integrated with SmartThings, together with  Microsoft\u2019s Azure Digital Twins technology and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service, to improve building maintenance and management by aggregating and analyzing IoT data from building systems and connected appliances.\n Microsoft\u2019s Azure IoT platform is able to process data messaging from millions of building sensors and devices and then use machine learning and AI to help building managers and operators determine what issues should be addressed in what order, and then link to Dynamics 365 Field Service to determine who is the right person, with the right skills, in the right location to resolve the issue.\n This collaboration with Samsung extends this capability to include Samsung smart appliances, HVAC systems and TVs, with plans to expand into digital signage equipment.\n The alliance also covers Samsung mobile devices, including the XCover Pro mobile phone, to create improved experiences for frontline workers involved in handling building issues. Additionally, Samsung plans to offer SmartThings mobile development tools to enable builders to craft custom, tailored connected living experiences for their end users.\n The collaboration will leverage data from Samsung\u2019s range of smart refrigerators, washing machines, vacuums, air purifiers, ovens and other devices connected through the intelligent SmartThings platform.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.\u201d\n          Byron  said she &#34;wish I had a time machine,&#34; accompanying a photo of her, Imahara and Belleci on the red carpet.\n      Adam Savage, a former &#34;Mythbusters&#34; host, said on  Twitter he was &#34;at a loss. No words. I\u2019ve been part of two big families with Grant Imahara over the last 22 years. Grant was a truly brilliant engineer, artist and performer, but also just such a generous, easygoing, and gentle PERSON. Working with Grant was so much fun.

"note_en": "The scam: Early this morning a close friend, I\u2019ll call her Rimini, woke up to numerous texts and voice mails from her father and sister in Italy. Someone had been using what looked like her Instagram account to follow and message her friends and family (including me) asking for money. Rimini\u2019s account had been cloned. Cloning, a\u00a0scam in which someone creates an account impersonating someone else\u2019s, is so common on Facebook and Instagram that it\u2019s one of the handful of\u00a0options available when  reporting an account as inappropriate. The scammers were targeting her friends and family, including grandparents in their 70s and 80s. Rimini was especially worried - an impersonator had successfully ripped off her grandparents several years ago with a similar scam.\n The cloned account used Rimini\u2019s name and\u00a0profile picture. The scammers had copied and reposted her photos and hashtags. To an elderly relative lacking tech savvy, the cloned account is indistinguishable from a real one. Rimini was worried. She contacted Instagram via a page dedicated to reporting cloned accounts.\n Response from Facebook: The response from Facebook (the owner of Instagram) was more surprising than the original scam - the online form  would not allow her to submit the form without a photo of  government issued ID or personal information such as a birth certificate, passport, driver\u2019s license, bank account records, voter ID card, medical records, social security card, etc.\n  Even a second of muddled, pre-coffee thought makes obvious that this demand for a photo of ID or personal information is burdensome to the user, unnecessary to investigate the allegation of fraud, and would cost the company far more than a mostly algorithmic approach - but more on that later. Rimini was less than enthusiastic about providing additional personal information to the platform on which she was being scammed. But, to prevent the criminals stealing from her friends and relatives, she grudgingly complied and uploaded a photo of her state issued driver\u2019s license. To protect her privacy, she blacked out her birthday, license ID number, and address. She went back to messaging her most vulnerable contacts, warning them of the scam, waiting for the cloned account to be deleted. Even though Rimini uploaded the photo, instead of deleting the cloned account, Facebook has been sending her automated emails demanding a picture of her holding her government issued or other form of ID. As of this writing, more than 6 hours later, many of Rimini\u2019s friends have reported the account as an imposter, but the account is still up, the scammer is still messaging people (including me) asking for money, and has started threatening Rimini. When Rimini sent Facebook screen captures of the threats from the cloned account, she received the same automated response requesting that she send ID. Although Facebook has demanded this type of information from people  locked out of their own account, the threat of someone robbing your loved ones is a significantly more time-sensitive issue with less pressure to comply quickly. Coercion is a strong word, but I believe it applies.\n  The hypotheses: Scammers gonna scam. What\u2019s harder to understand is the slow, inefficient, frustrating response from Facebook. I have two hypotheses to explain it:  Facebook is dumb and  Facebook is smart. The first hypothesis is that Facebook has an inefficient, expensive, largely manual approach to reviewing these kinds of fraud because Facebook could not come up with a better system. The company loses money, frustrates legitimate users, and allows the fraudsters to operate longer. In other words, the people running this type of security at Facebook are incompetent. I find this hypothesis hard to believe. The second hypothesis is that Facebook purposely requests this type of information and is slow to respond. They have a mechanism to link these types of official records to your account, ostensibly as some form of verification, and monetize them. As a result, they have an incentive to let scammers harass their users until the users give Facebook more data. In other words, the profits from collecting additional personal information and aligning with the criminals, are greater than the financial and reputation costs of maintaining an expensive, inefficient security process.\n The  Facebook is Dumb Hypothesis: The primary reasons I don\u2019t believe this are that, from a data science point of view, algorithmically verifying Rimini\u2019s allegation is laughably easy. The clone of Rimini\u2019s account has the following, easily algorithmically verifiable properties: it was created hours ago; it uses the same profile picture as Rimini&#39;s much older account; all of the pictures in the clone account are copies of pictures from Rimini\u2019s account; many of Rimini\u2019s followers (including me) flagged the clone account as such; the name is very similar to the name on Rimini\u2019s account; and, within hours of being created, the clone account started messaging numerous people asking for money. Even a scam that doesn\u2019t meet all those criteria should generate a very high \u201cfraud likelihood score\u201d leading to either an automated account suspension or a human reviewing the account. This kind of likelihood generation is very much how  Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA works and even how  Facebook claims its systems work. In summary, I don\u2019t believe Hypothesis One because there is no way that I\u2019m so much smarter than the entire Facebook security team that I just designed (before my second coffee) a fraud-detection algorithm more automated than theirs.\n The  Facebook is Smart Hypothesis: Several pieces of evidence suggest that Facebook earns more money than it loses from running an expensive, frustrating, manual process. First, the distinction between the fine print in the online form and the fine print on the email are revealing. The email has a disclaimer that the photos of personal data submitted will not be kept. The web form, the first place a user is asked to submit these, has a small disclaimer at bottom  that says nothing about Facebook not keeping the data. I think it is safe to assume that Facebook keeps all of the data it doesn\u2019t promise not to. The company demands these types of data from people trying to  unlock their account and collects data on people  whether or not they are on Facebook or even have an account. Second, data of the kind requested (bank records, voter ID cards, medical records) are incredibly valuable and Facebook has already been  fined billions of dollars for privacy violations for selling such data. And third, Facebook has already been criticized, fined, and  forced to reverse some of their less scrupulous practices designed to gather more information on people\u2019s identity.\n My two cents on Facebook: Unfortunately, the idea that Facebook benefits from collecting the data of victims of fraud and as a result facilitates the scams, fits with the ethos of the company. Facebook was built not on technical or creative innovation, but on its ability and willingness to gather and exploit data. Starting from Zuckerberg\u2019s theft of the idea for the platform (for which Facebook paid a  $65 million settlement), Facebook grew by exploiting its user\u2019s data to identify popular trends and potential competitors to imitate or buy. Facebook copied  newsfeed from Twitter,  Stories and numerous other features from Snap, invested in mobile based on tracking its users, bought WhatsApp and Instagram, etc. Although I\u2019ve been on the platform since its first year (my undergraduate university was among the first to which it expanded) I\u2019m hard pressed to name a single successful technical or creative innovation, except for how to gather and exploit data. While imitating competitors and tracking user data are the lifeblood of many Silicon Valley giants, for most companies those are bugs/features rather than the core value proposition.\n Facebook\u2019s voracious hunger for data has led them to choose internet scammers over their users. Shortly after the email from Facebook requesting her personal information, Rimini received a scarily similar request from the scammer.", "posttime": "2020-07-14 14:27:44", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Pixelopolis is an interactive installation that showcases self-driving miniature cars powered by  TensorFlow Lite. Each car is outfitted with its own Pixel phone, which used its camera to detect and understand signals from the world around it. In order to sense lanes, avoid collisions and read traffic signs, the phone uses machine learning running on the  Pixel Neural Core, which contains a version of an  Edge TPU.  An  edge computing implementation is a good option to make projects like this possible. Processing video and detecting objects are much more difficult using Cloud-based methods - due to latency. If you can, doing it on-device is much faster.  Users can interact with Pixelopolis via a \u201cstation\u201d (an app running on a phone), where they can select the destination the car will drive to. The car will navigate to the destination, and during the journey, the app shows real-time streaming video from the Car -- this allows the user to see what the car sees and detects. As you may notice from the gifs below, Pixelopolis has multilingual support built-in as well.    Using the front camera on a mobile device, we perform lane-keeping, localization and object detection right on the device in real-time. Not only that, in our case, the Pixel 4 also controls the motors and other electronic components via USB-C, so the car can stop when it detects other cars or turn at a right interaction when it needs to.   If you\u2019re interested in technical details, the remainder of this article describes the major components of the car, and our journey building it.  We explored a variety of models for Lane-keeping. As a baseline, we used a CNN to detect the traffic lines in each frame and adjust the steering wheel every frame, which works fine. We improved this by adding an LSTM and using multiple previous frames. After experimenting a bit more, we followed a similar model architecture to this  paper.    net_in = Input(shape = (80, 120, 3))x = Lambda(lambda x: x/127.5 - 1.0)(net_in)x = Conv2D(24, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2),padding=&#34;same&#34;, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x) x = Conv2D(36, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2),padding=&#34;same&#34;, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x)x = Conv2D(48, (5, 5), strides=(2, 2),padding=&#34;same&#34;, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x)x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding=&#34;same&#34;,activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x) x = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding=&#34;same&#34;,activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x)x = Dropout(0.3)(x)x = Flatten()(x)x = Dense(100, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x)x = Dense(50, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x)x = Dense(10, activation=&#39;elu&#39;)(x) net_out = Dense(1, name=&#39;net_out&#39;)(x)model = Model(inputs=net_in, outputs=net_out)\n Before we are able to use this model, we need to find a way to collect the image data from the car to train. The problem is we didn\u2019t have a car or a track to use at the time. So, we decided to use a simulator. We chose Unity and this  simulator project from Udacity for lane-keeping data collection.  By setting multiple waypoints on the track, the  car bot is able to drive to different locations and also collects data for us. In this simulator, we collect image data and steering angle every 50ms.    Since we do all data collection within the simulator, we need to create various environments in the scene because we want our model to be able to handle different lighting, background environment and other noises. We added these variables to the scene: random HDRI sphere ( with different rotation and exposure values), random brightness and color, and random cars.   Training the ML model using only the simulator doesn\u2019t mean it will actually work in the real-world situation, at least not the first try. The car ran on the tracks for a few seconds and then just went off the track for various reasons.  Later, we found out that we only trained the model using mostly straight tracks. To fix this imbalance data issue, we added various shapes of curves.  After fixing the imbalanced dataset, the car began to correctly navigate corners.    We started creating more complex situations for the car, such as adding multiple intersections to the tracks. We also added more routing paths to make the car handle these new conditions. However, we ran into new problems right away which is the car turned and hit the side track when it tried to turn at the intersection because it saw some random objects outside the track.   We tested out many solutions and went with the one that was most simple and effective. We cropped only the bottom \u00bc of the image and fed it to the lane keeping model, then adjusted the model input size to 120x40 and it works like a charm.   We use object detection for two purposes. One is for localization. Each car needs to know where it is in the city by detecting objects in its environment (in this case, we detect the traffic signs in the city). The other purpose is to detect other cars, so they won\u2019t bump into each other.  For choosing the object detector model there are many models already  available in TensorFlow object detection model zoo. But, for the Pixel 4 edge TPU, we use the ssd_mobilenet_edgetpu model.    ssd_mobilenet_edgetpu model on Pixel 4\u2019s \u201cNeural Core\u201d Edge TPU is currently the fastest mobilenet object detection. It takes only 6.6 ms per frame, which is more than enough for using with real-time applications.    We use image data from both simulation and real scenes to train the model. Next, we developed our own simulator for this using  Unreal Engine 4. The simulator generates random objects with random background and also an annotation file in a Pascal VOC format that is used in  TensorFlow object detection API.  For images that were taken from the real scene We have to do manual labeling using the labelImg tool.     We used  TensorBoard to monitor training progress. We use it to evaluate mAP (mean Average Precision), which normally you have to do it manually.    Since we want to run our ML model on the Pixel 4, which is running Android, we need to convert all the models to .tflite. Of course, you can use TensorFlow lite to target iOS and other devices as well (including microcontrollers). Here are the steps we did:  First, we convert the lane keeping model from .h5 to .tflite by using  Now, we have the model ready for the Android project. Next, we build a lane keeping class in our app. We began with an example android project from  here.   We have to convert the model checkpoint (.ckpt) to tensorflow lite format (.tflite)  Using  export_tflite_ssd_graph.py script to convert .ckpt to .pb file (the script already provided in Tensorflow object detector API)\n We use an Android sample project from  here. Then we modified the delegate to use Pixel 4 Edge TPU with the following code.   After a user selects a destination, the car will start driving itself. While it\u2019s driving, the car will stream what it sees to the station phone as a video feed. When we started implementing this part, we knew right away that streaming a raw video feed wouldn\u2019t be possible due to the amount of data that we need to transfer between several car phones and station phones. The solution that we use is, first, compress a raw image frame to a JPEG format to reduce the amount of that data, then stream the JPEG buffer via http protocol using  multipart/x-mixed-replace as an HTTP Content-type. This way we can achieve several video streams at the same time with unnoticeable lag between the devices.   We use NodeJS for the server app and MongoDB for the database.  Since we have multiple stations and cars, we need to find a way to connect these two together. We built a booking system similar to popular car apps. Our booking system has 3 steps. First, the car connects to the server and tells the server that it\u2019s ready to be booked. Second, the station connects to the server and asks the server for a car. Third, the server looks for the car that\u2019s ready and connects these two together and also stores the device_id from both station and car apps.   Since we will have a fleet of cars running around in the city, we need to find a way to navigate them. We use the Node/Edge concept. Node is a place on the map and Edge is the path between two Nodes. We then map each node to the actual signs in the city.  When the destination is selected on the station app, the station will send node_id to the server and the server will return an object which indicates a list of nodes and their properties so the car knows where to drive to and the expected sign it will see.   We started off with  NUCLEO-F411RE as our development board. We chose  Dynamixel for the motors.  We designed and developed a shield for additional components such as motors to reduce the number of wires inside the car chassis.There are three parts in the shield: 1) Battery measurement in voltage, 2) On/off switch with MOSFET, 3) Buttons.  In the later phase, we would like to make the car a lot smaller, so we moved from NUCLEO-F411RE to NUCLEO-L432KC because it has a lot smaller footprint.     We designed and 3D printed the car chassis with PLA material. The front wheels are castor wheels.   We added a battery measurement circuit to the board and cut off the power when the phone detached from the board.   We added status LEDs so we can easily debug the state of the board. From the previous version, we encountered a motor overheating issue, so in this version we improved the ventilation by adding a fan to the motor. We also added a USB Type-C power delivery to the board so the phone can use the car battery.   We moved all the control buttons and status LEDs to the back of the car for an easy access.   This is the final version and we need to reduce the car footprint as much as possible. First, we changed the board from NUCLEO-F411RE to NUCLEO-L432KC to achieve a smaller footprint. Second, the front wheel has been changed to ball caster wheels. Third, we rearranged the board location to the top of the car and stacked the battery underneath the board. Lastly, we removed the USB Type-C power delivery because we want to prolong the driving time by giving all battery power to the board and motors instead of the phone.      There are many areas that we plan to improve this experience.  Currently, the motor and the controller board are powered by three packs of 3000mAh lithium-ion batteries and we have a charging circuit to handle the charging process. When we want to charge the battery, we would need to move the car to the charging station and plug the power adapter to the back of the car to charge. This has a lot of downsides because the car won\u2019t be able to run on the track if it\u2019s charging and the charging time is a few hours which is quite long.  We would like to reduce this process by changing the battery to an 18650 battery cell instead. This type of battery is used in electronics such as laptops, tools, and e-bikes, due to the high capacity in a small form factor. This way we can swap the battery easily by popping in the new ones and let the empty ones charge in the battery charger without leaving the car at the charging station.   Localization is a very important process for this installation and we would like to make it more robust by adding SLAM to our app. We believe that this would improve the turning mechanism significantly.

"note_en": "We are Lorax Horne  u/netlorax and Emma Best  u/natsecgeek, here to answer your questions about  Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), a publishing group of which we are both members. On June 19, we published 269 gigabytes of data gathered from over 200 police departments from the United States released by Anonymous as  Blue Leaks. A few days later, Twitter suspended our Twitter account. On July 2, German authorities seized our public data server, an escalation that  Emma tweeted as soon as we knew.\n Blue Leaks contains evidence of law enforcement tracking  recent protests against police brutality and  Black Lives Matters, keeping  databases of ethnic groups like Roma people, and spreading  right-wing propaganda as if it were intelligence via these  fusion centers. Other research has uncovered a  Panama crypto currency laundromat and U.S. law enforcement monitoring  Canadian climate and indigenous activism.\n  &#34;For roughly the past year and a half, a small group of activists known as DDoSecrets, has quietly but steadily released a stream of hacked and leaked documents, from Russian oligarchs&#39; emails to the stolen communications of Chilean military leaders to shell company databases. Late last week, the group unleashed its most high-profile leak yet: BlueLeaks, a 269-gigabyte collection of more than a million police files provided to DDoSecrets by a source aligned with the hacktivist group Anonymous, spanning emails, audio files, and interagency memos largely pulled from law enforcement &#34;fusion centers,&#34; which serve as intelligence-sharing hubs. According to DDoSecrets, it represents the largest-ever release of hacked US police data.&#34;\n Emma has done AMAs before! Make sure to check them out, related to DDoSecrets&#39; releases like  Dark Side of the Kremlin, as well as their FOIA  transparency work.\n Twitter did not ban us, or even issue any warnings, after any of our previous publications of hacked data, such as the  Cayman National Bank release, claimed by hacktivist Phineas Fisher, which was recently used for investigations in The Guardian/OCCRP about  Azerbaijan&#39;s former national security minister and coronavirus  corruption in Armenia.\n Leave us questions ahead of time, and we will begin to answer starting Sunday, July 12 @ 9:00 ET (15:00 CEST), continuing until 14:00 ET (20:00 CEST) or until we run out of steam/questions.\n  It looks to be winding down, so thanks to everyone for your questions and interest. We&#39;ll try to check back for any late-straggling questions later this evening.", "posttime": "2020-07-14 13:41:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "I determined that there was no good tutorial on how the average person can liquefy nitrogen or air. A few references to cryocoolers, which use an internal helium Stirling engine to create a cold head exist, and I even saw one person use this as a means to liquefy nitrogen, allowing the gas to condenses as it passes over the head. This method is cheating because it relies on a self-contained refrigeration unit. I wanted to do this using regenerative cooling just like Carl Linde back in 1895.\n  This tutorial will go over some basic theory about cryogenic liquefication. The tutorial will cover all the steps necessary for one to duplicate my work and build a nitrogen gas liquefier. Each page covers a different topic necessary for the process, including temperature measurements, the compressor, precooler, cooler, throttle and reservoir.\n  Basically, there are three methods for making liquid nitrogen. One, you can use a cryocooler. You need to acquire a cryogenic refrigeration unit and strip out the cold head. Two, you can use a turbo expander. This is a device that takes pressurized gas and extracts work from it during the isentropic expansion phases. This is truly the most efficient method, but the cost is prohibitive for the home builder. Finally, one can throttle the pressurized gas. While it is true that an ideal gas maintains the same temperature when expanded into a vacuum, real gases, due to friction and other losses does drop its temperature. I believe it falls 1/4 degree Centigrade for each atmosphere of pressure drop. This is the method using the Joule-Thomson effect is the one that deserves attention.\n  Now, simple JT expansion would just drop the temperature 50F if we compressed our gas to 200 atmospheres (2900 psi). One needs to cool the gas prior to expansion so the exiting gas from the nozzle is low enough for gas to condense and liquefy. Linde utilized regenerative cooling. The exiting, cool gas passes back over the pressurized coils in a countercurrent fashion. This cools the incoming gas; the expanded gas on the next pass is slightly cooler than before. After many cycles, gas will be cold enough to liquefy and collect in a reservoir.\n  Now, everything I have mentioned is already available in books and on the internet. So, why this tutorial? While the theory is simple, the actual application of the theory and construction of a working device is not as simple. I successfully liquefied air in sufficient quantities and I plan to show you how this can be done for the home builder.\n  The generator gets its supply of N2 from my own homemade pressure swing adsorber. This is a completely separate project that you can view  here when you are done with this one.\n         I have built a reliable cryogenic thermometer for a fraction of the cost of other models being sold. It has a range of -400F to 250F in increments of 0.1F. It can measure Fahrenheit and Celcius. The temperature drift is no more than 0.005F/F, giving you a very stable reading. The display is LCD so you can read it in all lighting conditions. It runs off of 120vac using an AC-DC adapter and uses a 6&#39; long RTD probe. All of this is included. Below is an image of the device. I will be selling these soon for about $150, which is well below the cost of other commercial items.. Please check back.\n  If you like the really cold, you may like the really hot. I have an great tutorial on induction heating as well as many videos on Youtube under the handle &#34;imsmooth&#34;.

"note_en": "Peter Gray has studied\u00a0 how learning happens without any academic requirements at a democratic school.\u00a0The Boston College research professor also wrote about the long history and benefits of age-mixed, self-directed education in his book  Free to Learn. Over the years, as he encountered more and more families who had adopted this approach at home (these so-called \u201cunschoolers\u201d are estimated to represent about 10 percent of the more than two million homeschooled children), he began to wonder about its outcomes in that setting. Finding no academic studies that adequately answered his question, he decided to conduct his own.\n In 2011, he and colleague Gina Riley surveyed 232 parents who unschool their children, which they defined as not following any curriculum, instead letting the children take charge of their own education. The respondents were overwhelmingly positive about their unschooling experience, saying it improved their children\u2019s general well-being as well as their learning, and also enhanced family harmony. Their challenges primarily stemmed from feeling a need to defend their practices to family and friends, and overcoming their own deeply ingrained ways of thinking about education. (The results are discussed at length  here.)\n This led Gray to wonder how unschooled children themselves felt about the experience, and what impact it may have had on their ability to pursue higher education and find gainful and satisfying employment. So last year, he asked readers of  his blog to disseminate a survey to their networks, and received 75 responses from adults ranging in age from 18 to 49; almost all of them had had at least three years of unschooling experience. They were split almost evenly among three groups: those who had never attended school; those who had only attended school for some portion of kindergarten through sixth grades; and those with either type of early experience who had also attended school for some portion of seventh through 10 th grades, but not afterward. (The results are explained in detail in Gray\u2019s recent four-part blog series, which begins  here.)\n  He was satisfied with the number of responses, but cautions that, as with many social science studies, the necessarily limited collection method may have produced a biased sample that may not represent the entire population of unschoolers. Such studies can nevertheless yield useful insights, he says, especially when considered in concert with other data, such as other surveys, or patterns that emerge from anecdotal accounts.\n Gray found that the results did correlate closely with his more thorough studies of alumni from the Sudbury Valley School ( a democratic school in Sudbury Valley, Massachusetts), as well as what he\u2019d personally heard from unschoolers, and what he\u2019d read online. Moreover, even taken in isolation, \u201cwhat the study does unambiguously show,\u201d he says, \u201cis that it is possible to take the unschooling route and then go on to a highly satisfying adult life.\u201d\n  All but three of the 75 respondents felt the advantages of unschooling clearly outweighed the disadvantages. Almost all said they benefited from having had the time and freedom to discover and pursue their personal interests, giving them a head start on figuring out their career preferences and developing expertise in relevant areas. Seventy percent also said \u201cthe experience enabled them to develop as highly self-motivated, self-directed individuals,\u201d Gray notes on his blog. Other commonly cited benefits included having a broader range of learning opportunities; a richer, age-mixed social life; and a relatively seamless transition to adult life. \u201cIn many ways I started as an adult, responsible for my own thinking and doing,&#34; said one woman who responded to Gray&#39;s survey.\n   \u201cVery few had any serious complaints against unschooling,\u201d Gray says, and more than a third of the respondents said they could think of no disadvantages at all. For the remainder, the most significant disadvantages were: dealing with others\u2019 judgments; some degree of social isolation; and the challenges they experienced adjusting to the social styles and values of their schooled peers.\n Social isolation (cited by 21 percent of respondents) usually stemmed from a dearth of other nearby unschoolers and the difficulty of socializing with school children with busy schedules and a \u201cdifferent orientation toward life,\u201d Gray says. He cautions that it\u2019s best to consider these results within the broader cultural context: \u201cIf I were to ask people who went to school, I would probably find a similar number who felt socially isolated.\u201d\n What stood out, he adds, is that \u201cmany more said they felt their social experiences were better than they would have had in school.\u201d Sixty-nine percent were \u201cclearly happy with their social lives,\u201d he says, and made friends through such avenues as local homeschooling groups, organized afterschool activities, church, volunteer or youth organizations, jobs, and neighbors. In particular, \u201cthey really treasured the fact that they had friends who were older or younger, including adults. They felt this was a more normal kind of socializing experience than just being with other people your age.\u201d\n Only 11 percent said they felt behind in one or more academic areas (most commonly math), which they overcame by applying themselves when the need arose. Only two felt their learning gaps hindered them from succeeding in life, and judging by their full responses, \u201cit was almost more like a self-image issue\u2014they grew up feeling ignorant and then made choices based on that feeling,\u201d Gray says. More typical experiences were like that of a woman who earned a B.A. in both computer science and mathematics, despite entering college without any formal math training beyond fifth grade. Another noted that unschooling \u201cfollows the premise that if a child has a goal, they&#39;ll learn whatever they need to in order to meet it. For instance, I don&#39;t like math, but I knew I would need to learn it in order to graduate. So that&#39;s what I did.\u201d\n Three people were very dissatisfied overall. In all three cases, the respondents said their mothers were in poor mental health and the fathers were uninvolved. Two of the three also happened to be the only ones who mentioned having been raised in a fundamentalist religious home, though the survey didn\u2019t ask this question specifically. It appeared to Gray that the unschooling was not intentional\u2014the parent had aimed to teach a religious curriculum, \u201cbut was incompetent and stopped teaching,\u201d he notes. In all of these cases, the children\u2019s contact with other people was also very restricted; moreover, they were not given any choice about their schooling and therefore felt deprived of school.\n  Overall, 83 percent of the respondents had gone on to pursue some form of higher education. Almost half of those had either completed a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, or were currently enrolled in such a program; they attended (or had graduated from) a wide range of colleges, from Ivy League universities to state universities and smaller liberal-arts colleges.\n Several themes emerged: Getting into college was typically a fairly smooth process for this group; they adjusted to the academics fairly easily, quickly picking up skills such as class note-taking or essay composition; and most felt at a distinct advantage due to their high self-motivation and capacity for self-direction. \u201cThe most frequent complaints,\u201d Gray notes on his blog, \u201cwere about the lack of motivation and intellectual curiosity among their college classmates, the constricted social life of college, and, in a few cases, constraints imposed by the curriculum or grading system.\u201d\n Most of those who went on to college did so without either a high school diploma or general education diploma (GED), and without taking the SAT or ACT. Several credited interviews and portfolios for their acceptance to college, but by far the most common route to a four-year college was to start at a community college (typically begun at age 16, but sometimes even younger).\n None of the respondents found college academically difficult, but some found the rules and conventions strange and sometimes off-putting. Young people who were used to having to find things out on their own were taken aback, and even in some cases felt insulted, \u201cwhen professors assumed they had to tell them what they were supposed to learn,\u201d Gray says.\n    In the words of one woman: \u201cI already had a wealth of experience with self-directed study. I knew how to motivate myself, manage my time, and complete assignments without the structure that most traditional students are accustomed to. \u2026 I know how to figure things out for myself and how to get help when I need it.\u201d Added another: \u201cI discovered that people wanted the teacher to tell them what to think. \u2026 It had never, ever occurred to me to ask someone else to tell me what to think when I read something.\u201d\n All survey respondents were also asked about their employment status and career, and 63 answered a follow-up survey asking about their work in more detail. More than three-quarters of those who answered the follow-up survey said they were financially self-sufficient; the rest were either students, stay-at-home parents, or under the age of 21 and launching businesses while living at home. But a number of those who were self-sufficient noted that this hinged on their ability to maintain a frugal lifestyle (several added that this was a conscious choice, allowing them to do enjoyable and meaningful work).\n The range of jobs and careers was very broad\u2014from film production assistant to tall-ship bosun, urban planner, aerial wildlife photographer, and founder of a construction company\u2014but a few generalizations emerged. Compared to the general population, an unusually high percentage of the survey respondents went on to careers in the creative arts\u2014about half overall, rising to nearly four out of five in the always-unschooled group. Similarly, a high number of respondents (half of the men and about 20 percent of the women) went on to science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) careers. (The same held true in  another recent survey of unschoolers.) \u201cSTEM careers are also kind of creative careers\u2014they involve looking for something, seeking answers, solving problems,\u201d Gray says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at it that way, it sort of fits.\u201d\n The reason for this correlation is something this survey can\u2019t answer. \u201cMaybe unschooling promotes creativity, or maybe dispositionally creative people or families are more likely to choose unschooling,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d\n Additionally, just more than half of the respondents were entrepreneurs (this category overlapped considerably with the creative arts category). But what Gray found most striking is the complete absence (in both this and his Sudbury study samples) of \u201cthe typical person who gets an MBA and goes on to become an accountant or middle manager in some business. People with these educational backgrounds don\u2019t go on to bureaucratic jobs. They do work in teams, but where there is a more democratic relationship within the team.\u201d\n He adds that this trend manifests across white- and blue-collar careers. \u201cIn the Sudbury survey, there were people working as carpenters or auto mechanics, etcetera, but in situations where they were occupationally self-directed, set their own schedules, and solved their own problems, rather than shuffled papers, or worked on assembly lines where no original work was being done.\u201d In other words, he says, unschoolers of all types had overwhelmingly chosen careers high in those qualities that sociologists have found lead to the highest levels of work satisfaction.\n  Finally, the survey offered some insights about what makes for successful unschooling. Parents\u2019 involvement levels with their children differed a lot, Gray says. Some were more hands-off, whereas others helped with learning, and in some cases even learned things (such as a foreign language) alongside their child, following the child\u2019s lead. \u201cAll of those ways seem to work,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople only complained when they felt their parents were negligent about treating the child as a human being who has needs\u2014including emotional needs\u2014and who helped fill those needs.\u201d\n The results also led to another important conclusion: \u201cThe need for parents to be aware that children need more than their families,\u201d Gray says. \u201cPeople are designed to learn not just from their own parents, but from the wider world. If you don\u2019t send your child to school where they\u2019re automatically connected to other kids, other values, etcetera, it\u2019s important to find a way that the family can be sufficiently involved in the larger community, or that the child has ways to be involved. Kids need that both socially and for their learning.\u201d This ties in with the fact that \u201ca major complaint of the three who disliked unschooling was that their parents isolated them and prevented them from exploring outside of the family or outside of the insular group with which the family was tied,\u201d Gray adds on his blog.\n   In sum: \u201cThe findings of our survey suggest that unschooling can work beautifully if the whole family, including the children, buy into it, if the parents are psychologically healthy and happy, and if the parents are socially connected to the broader world and facilitate their children\u2019s involvement with that world. It can even work well when some of these criteria are not fully met.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-14 12:40:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":
