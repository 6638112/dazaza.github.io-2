A great many newcomers will arrive with an open mind — as we all did once — but so too will many representatives of the incumbents to this disruption emerge from the woodwork to insist that what we can see with our very own eyes isn’t actually happening because, according to their theory, it can’t.</p><p>  因为比特码N开始跨越牛跑，我们必须为更广泛的世界突然和知情的兴趣支撑自己。许多新人将以开放的思想到达 - 正如我们所有人都曾经做过的那样 - 但是，许多人的代表对这种中断的人来说，从木工中出现，坚持我们自己的眼睛可以看到什么并没有实际上发生因为，根据他们的理论，它不能。</p><p> Bitcoin can’t be a store of value because it  has no intrinsic value. It can’t be a unit of account because it is too volatile. It can’t be a medium of exchange because it is not widely used to price goods and services. These are the three properties of money. Therefore, Bitcoin can’t be money. But Bitcoin has no other basis for being valued, therefore it is valueless. QED.</p><p> 比特币不能成为价值的商店，因为它没有内在价值。它不能是一个帐户单位，因为它过于挥发。它不能成为交换媒介，因为它没有广泛用于价格和服务。这些是金钱的三个属性。因此，比特币不能是金钱。但比特币别无其他依据被重视，因此它是有价值的。 QED。</p><p> I call this argument,  semantics therefore reality. What could possibly falsify this? It is, at root, a claim about the material world; about what will, or in this case  won’t, happen in real life. And yet it looks rather like it relies entirely on the meanings of words. In  discussing dollarization in Ecuador — the instructive process of an “official” money being spontaneously replaced by a simpler superior money — Larry White says of those who deny by definition that such a thing can even happen that they, “ are only looking at the blackboard and not at what is happening outside the window.” This is a curious approach to understanding novel phenomena, that, in general, I would not recommend. Reality doesn’t care how you describe it.</p><p> 我称之为这个论点，因此是现实的。什么可能伪造这个？它是根本，关于物质世界的主张;关于什么，或者在这种情况下不会发生什么，在现实生活中发生。然而，它看起来非常像它完全依赖于单词的含义。在讨论厄瓜多尔的美元化 - 一个“官方”金钱被自发的优秀金钱被自发所取代的指导过程 - 拉里白人说那些通过定义否认这样的人甚至可以发生这种情况，“只是看着黑板。”而不是在窗外发生的事情。“这是一种理解新颖现象的好奇方法，一般来说，我不会推荐。现实不关心你是如何描述它的。</p><p> But there is also a softer, slipperier, more agnostic form of the semantic theory that acknowledges that  something is happening: that Bitcoin is not  nothing, but that it surely cannot be money because it is so dissimilar to the standard (semantic) conception of what money should be and how it should behave that the proposition is too uncomfortable to accept. It certainly seems like a network of some kind: it is global, digital, sound, open, and programmable. And it has undeniably increased in value from a point in the past when it was worth nothing at all. But does this distinguish it from a regular old financial bubble? Can “money” be reconciled with bubble-like behavior? And is Bitcoin’s digital nature such a plus? Doesn’t the Internet enable a speed and potency of virality that is arguably finely tuned to inflate a bubble in anything deemed openly, programmably digital? Bitcoin may be something — maybe the “blockchain technology” it runs on?— but, obviously, it just  seems like Bitcoin isn’t money.</p><p> 但是也有一个更柔和，滑移，更不可知的语义理论形式，承认事情正在发生的事情：比特币不是什么，但它肯定不能是金钱，因为它与标准（语义）的概念如此差异金钱应该是以及如何表现出这个命题对接受的命题太不舒服。它肯定看起来像某种网络：它是全球性的，数字，声音，开放和可编程的。当它根本没有任何东西时，它的价值无可否认地增加了价值。但这是否将其与常规旧的金融泡沫区分开来？可以“金钱”与泡沫的行为和解？比特币的数字性质如此加吗？互联网没有速度和效力，可有趣的是精细调整，以便在透露的任何象征，可编程数字化的任何事情中膨胀泡沫？比特币可能是某种 - 也许是“区块链技术”它在它上运行？ - 但显然，它似乎只是比特币不是金钱。</p><p>  What would it seem like if it did seem like a global, digital, sound, open, programmable money was monetizing from absolute zero?</p><p>  如果它似乎似乎是全球，数字，声音，开放，可编程的金钱，它会从绝对零货币化吗？ </p><p>    The semantic theory is alarmingly static. This stasis is rooted in its semantic chicanery: many languages have different verbs to distinguish between “being” as in having some property intrinsically or circumstantially, such as  ser and  estar, respectively, in Spanish. English does not. I  am male just as I  am hungry. But in which sense  is Bitcoin volatile? Is it  intrinsically volatile or is it volatile at some moment, in some circumstances, relative to some standard? Are goods and services somehow fundamentally resistant to being priced in Bitcoin? What happens if you try to do so? Is it like dividing by zero?</p><p>语义理论令人惊奇。这种瘀滞植根于其语义暗示：许多语言具有不同的动词，以区分“在本质”或间接地或间接的某些财产中，例如SER和ESTAR，以西班牙语。英语没有。我是男性，就像我饿的那样。但是在哪种意义上是比特币挥发物？在某些情况下，它是本质上的挥发性还是在某些情况下挥发性，相对于一些标准？是商品和服务，不知何故，在比特币的定价是根本上的？如果你试图这样做会发生什么？它喜欢除以零吗？</p><p> Imagine if all respectable business knowledge had been derived from studying large, established companies because there had never been a start-up in living memory. If a start-up then came along, people might well say, “ that’s not a business because it doesn’t make a profit,” or, “ that’s not a business because it doesn’t have a defined business plan.” Clearly, this would be ill-advised. That is not to say that their models and definitions would be perfectly wrong instead of perfectly right, but rather that things are not so binary. Reality is messy, and it is reality we should care about, not our theories of reality that, it turns out, have never really been tested …</p><p> 想象一下，如果所有尊重的商业知识都从学习大型，建立的公司获得，因为在生活记忆中从未初创过。如果一个启动然后出现，人们可能会说，“这不是一个企业，因为它没有利润，”或者“这不是一个企业，因为它没有规定的商业计划。”显然，这将是不明智的。这并不是说他们的模型和定义是完全错误而不是完全正确的，而是事情不是那么二进制。现实是凌乱的，它是现实，我们应该关心，而不是我们现实的理论，事实证明，从未真正过测试过......</p><p> This essay is the first in a three-part series. In Part One,  Wittgenstein’s Money, I propose we should reject the arrogance of  knowing that a new money cannot emerge because reality follows from our semantics. I hope that by instead embracing ignorance and uncertainty, and by focusing on plausible behaviors and circumstances, we will have the tools to recognise Bitcoin’s emergence rather than rejecting it out of hand as a disprovable theorem. We will probe what it might seem like if it did seem like Bitcoin were money.</p><p> 这篇文章是三部分系列中的第一个。第一部分，Wittgenstein的钱，我提出了我们应该拒绝知道新资金不能出现的傲慢，因为我的语义所遵循的现实。我希望通过相互拥抱无知和不确定性，并专注于合理的行为和情况，我们将拥有识别比特币的出现，而不是将其拒绝作为一个无法辨认的定理。我们将探讨它看起来似乎的似乎似乎是金钱。</p><p> In Part Two,   The Capital Strip Mine, I will paint a dire picture of what we could expect to happen to the ability to create and sustain capital when a monetary regime is contrived to ignore — or even go against — the ideal characteristics we are about to explore. In Part Three,   Bitcoin Is Venice, I will take substantial poetic license in charting the course for recovery from such a disaster — what it might seem like  as it is seeming like a global, digital, sound, open, programmable money is monetizing from absolute zero.</p><p> 在第二部分，首都矿山，我将在货币政权被忽视时，涂上我们所能期望的能力，以忽视 - 甚至反对 - 我们所致的理想特征探索。第三部分，比特币是威尼斯，我将采取大量的诗意许可，在绘制这种灾难中恢复课程 - 它看起来像是似乎是一个全球，数字，声音，开放，可编程的钱被从绝对货币化零。</p><p>    Let us start with a thought experiment. Imagine you could see the future in a very peculiar and economically relevant way: you know how everybody will value everything at every point in time. You are certain of it. Would you ever need money? Let’s explore.</p><p>    让我们从思想实验开始。想象一下，您可以以非常奇特和经济相关的方式看到未来：您知道每个人将如何在各个时间点重视所有内容。你肯定了。你会需要钱吗？让我们探索。</p><p> If you know how you will value things then you know what  you will want to buy at any given point in the future, say Alice’s apples. Now, normally you would need money because Alice might not value whatever you had that you wanted to trade, say zebras. But in this case, you know how Alice will value zebras because you know how she will value everything. If that’s enough to buy the apples, great. If not, find something else she values more highly, say beer, and then go find Bob. Now, if Bob also doesn’t value your zebras, that’s fine too because you can just keep doing this until you close the loop, given you know all these valuations. You can instantaneously grasp the best path from zebra to apple and trade all the way to what you want. If these valuations flap around over time (which you will also know) you can plan to orchestrate your trading across time to get the best rates.</p><p> 如果你知道如何重视事情，那么你知道未来任何特定点将要购买的东西，说Alice的苹果。现在，通常你需要金钱，因为爱丽丝可能不会重视你想要交易的任何东西，说斑马。但在这种情况下，你知道爱丽丝如何重视斑马，因为你知道她会如何重视一切。如果这足以购买苹果，很棒。如果没有，请找到别的东西，她更高度，说啤酒，然后去找鲍勃。现在，如果鲍勃也没有重视你的斑马，那没关系，因为你可以继续这样做，直到你关闭循环，因为你知道所有这些估值。你可以瞬间掌握斑马到苹果的最佳道路，一直交易到你想要的东西。如果这些估值随着时间的推移（你也知道）翻转（你也知道），你可以计划在跨越时间来协调你的交易，以获得最优惠的价格。</p><p> An obvious objection might be that all this excess trading would be a massive nuisance. Maybe you wouldn’t actually  need money, but it would still save you time and energy because rather than having to deduce and execute the highest value trading loop in advance of every purchase, you could jump immediately to who valued zebras most, get the money, and go back to Alice. And in fact, you could do even better, because you would sell the zebra when its value peaked, and keep the money for however long happens to pass before wanting to buy the apples. Fair enough, money is still useful.</p><p> 一个明显的反对意见可能是所有这些超额交易都是一种巨大的滋扰。也许你实际上不需要钱，但它仍然可以节省你的时间和能量，而不是必须在每次购买之前推断和执行最高价值的交易循环，你可以立即跳到尊重斑马最有价值的斑马，拿到钱，然后回到爱丽丝。事实上，你可以做得更好，因为当你的价值达到顶峰时，你会出售斑马，但是在想要购买苹果之前，仍然长时间留下钱。足够公平，金钱仍然有用。 </p><p> But now imagine that  everybody had this superpower. Everybody knew what everybody else valued at every time. Now would you need money? Let’s ring up Alice and find out. You go to Alice with your zebras to get some apples. Does it matter that Alice doesn’t want zebras? I don’t think it does anymore because Alice now has the superpower too; if she doesn’t want zebras herself, she knows that Quintin does. If she wants Quintin’s quiches, perfect. If not — if she really wants Peter’s pies — then luckily Peter also knows that Quintin wants zebras. If he wants Quintin’s quiches, perfect, if not … what happens is that the previously inconvenient highest value trading loop doesn’t now need to be executed — it merely needs to exist at all in order for everybody to establish the relevant exchange rate between whatever they have and are trying to buy, or whatever they want and are trying to sell. This knowledge would make money moot.</p><p>但现在想象一下，每个人都有这个超级大国。每个人都知道每次其他人都有什么重视。你现在需要钱吗？让我们敲打爱丽丝并找出答案。你和你的斑马一起去爱丽丝得到一些苹果。爱丽丝不想要斑马是否有重要吗？我认为这不再做了，因为爱丽丝现在也有超级大国;如果她不想要斑马自己，她知道Quintin做了。如果她想要Quintin的奖金，完美。如果不是 - 如果她真的想要彼得的馅饼 - 那么幸运的彼得也知道Quintin想要斑马。如果他想要Quintin的奖金，完美的话，如果不是......发生了什么，现在不方便的最高价值交易循环现在不需要执行 - 它只是需要存在，以便每个人都建立无论之间的相关汇率他们有并试图购买，或者他们想要的任何东西，并试图卖掉。这种知识会赚钱。</p><p> If we were at all tempted to believe that some particularly economically astute individual could, in theory, know all others’ future valuations, we would be forced to admit they also knew all future events as well. How could they know how Alice will value things at an arbitrary point in the future if we don’t know  what things there are to value?</p><p> 如果我们被认为有些特别经济地是精明的个人可以在理论上知道所有其他人的未来估值，我们将被迫承认他们也了解所有未来的活动。如果我们不知道有价值是什么，他们如何知道消化力将如何在未来任意点重视事情？</p><p> This is the key to unwinding the thought experiment. Nobody can know all future events, nor the whims of all perfect strangers. Arguably, we can barely know  any future events or the whims of  any strangers. We may be reasonably sure of events close to us in time and circumstance, but as we get further away from our own familiarity, further into the future, or both, we obviously can claim to know less and less. Hence, we might be able to guess what we ourselves or others close to us value  now, but others we know less well, or anybody at all further and further into the future, we cannot know. If we did know this, we would not need money. But we can’t, therefore money is useful.</p><p> 这是解除思想实验的关键。没有人能够了解所有未来的事件，也不知道所有完美的陌生人的突发事件。可以说，我们几乎无法知道任何陌生人的未来事件或突发事件。我们可能会在时间和环境中相当肯定的事件，但随着我们进一步远离我们自己的熟悉，进一步进入未来，或两者，我们显然可以声称更少地了解。因此，我们可能能够猜测现在我们自己或其他人靠近美国的价值，但我们不太了解的其他人，或者任何人都无法知道。如果我们知道这一点，我们就不需要钱。但我们不能，因此金钱很有用。</p><p> What this shows is that a “double coincidence of wants” that makes barter untenable at any worthwhile scale has little to do with “convenience” and is first and foremost a product of knowledge. We can only have a limited appreciation of others’ valuations, and this appreciation diminishes the further removed from us they are in circumstance and in time. And note, this includes our future selves; we do not know for sure what we will value in the future because we do not know what will  happen to us in future. Money is useful to us because of economic uncertainty: our fundamental inability to know much at all about what all others think and about what is going to change.</p><p> 这表明的是，在任何有价值的规模上表现出易于易货的“想要”的“双重巧合”与“便利性”一点几乎没有，并且首先是知识的产品。我们只能对他人的估值有限欣赏，并且这种升值减少了我们在环境中进一步删除的删除。并注意，这包括我们未来的自我;我们不确定我们将来的价值是什么，因为我们不知道将来会发生什么。由于经济不确定性，金钱对我们有用：我们的基本上无法了解所有其他人认为和如何改变的事情。</p><p> Money would ideally give its users a sense of certainty about the future — a kind of tacit agreement with the rest of the economic network precisely because next to nothing else can be known surely enough to be agreed upon in advance. But if a new money were to emerge, it would very much be challenging the agreement, and hence would be fraught with uncertainty over the period of its emergence. Its very existence would represent a kind of  disagreement that would seem confusing and disorienting.</p><p> 理想情况下，金钱会让用户对未来的确定性感到肯定 - 一种与其他经济网络的默契达成协议，正是因为旁边没有其他任何东西可以提前达成一致。但是，如果出现新的金钱，这项协议将非常具有挑战性，因此在其出现时期会受到不确定性的影响。它的存在将代表一种似乎令人困惑和迷失方向的一种分歧。</p><p> We could point to this engendered uncertainty as clear-cut evidence against the new money, and reason by extension that the necessary network effects will fail to materialise. But this would be to avoid the legitimate question as to whether accepting greater uncertainty in the short run is worth gaining greater certainty in the long run, and if network effects could develop on this basis instead. This would depend on the real-life merits. There would be no textbook answer; no equation to solve; no definitions to check against — particularly not definitions that are only absolutely valid in precisely the case of zero competition, maximal certainty, and static time: a kind of inexplicably non-entropic universe. A new money could not be helpfully described as providing utility as a “medium of exchange” from its beginnings — although, in the long run, being  digital certainly wouldn’t hurt its chances in this regard …</p><p> 我们可以指出这种有利的不确定性作为针对新资金的清除证据，而且推广的理由是必要的网络效应将无法实现。但这将是为了避免在短期内接受更大的不确定性的合法问题值得在长期上获得更大的确定性，如果可以在此基础上发展网络效果。这取决于现实生活的优点。没有教科书答案;没有方程来解决;没有定义来检查 - 特别是零竞争，最大确定性和静态时间的零案例完全没有定义，即零竞争，最大的确定性和静态时间：一种莫名其妙的非熵宇宙。新的钱无法有助于将效用作为从其开始的“交换媒介” - 尽管从长远来看，数码肯定不会伤害这方面的机会......</p><p> What it would seem like if it did seem like a new money were emerging would be a promise of superior certainty in the future, with an admission of increased uncertainty in the present. It would seem as much like a dangerous and exciting narrative as a provable guarantee.</p><p> 如果它似乎似乎是新的金钱似乎是新兴的，这将是未来卓越的肯定的承诺，承认现在增加不确定性。似乎是一种危险和令人兴奋的叙述，作为可提供保证。 </p><p>   But  how usefully can money fill a demand for certainty? We should think about what it would mean for money to be more or less useful in this way, but attempting to measure this utility  brings us to the precipice of a philosophical pickle. Given this utility is understood as an emergent reaction to constant and unpredictable change, we must be careful to choose a measure that is invariant to this change. We don’t want to use a stretchy ruler. We must dig a little deeper lest we fall back into the semantic theory and demand money be a “store of value” without further exploration of what  being a store of value could practically consist of.</p><p>但是有多常用的钱可以填补肯定的需求？我们应该考虑金钱的意义或多或少有用，但试图衡量这个实用程序将我们带到哲学泡菜的悬崖上。鉴于这种效用被理解为对不可预测和不可预测的变化的紧急反应，必须小心选择不变的措施，这一变化是不变的。我们不想使用弹力尺。我们必须挖掘一点更深，以免我们回到语义理论中，并要求金钱是一个“价值储存”，而无需进一步探索价值储存就是实际组成的。</p><p> As a starting point, let us assume it means that a candidate money retains its purchasing power over time; that it will not intrinsically depreciate, like a tool that we need to repair or food that will rot; or that will lose value for more intangible reasons, in the sense of going out of fashion, like clothes or jewellery, or real estate in a declining area.</p><p> 作为一个起点，让我们认为这意味着候选金钱随着时间的推移保留了购买力;它不会本质上贬值，就像我们需要修理或食物的工具一样;或者这将失去价值以获得更加无形的原因，在流行的意义上，如衣服或珠宝，或在下降区域的房地产。</p><p> We immediately run into problems: notice that whether or not any such item “retains its purchasing power” is precisely subject to the change we admit we cannot predict. It is circumstantial and behavioral, and depends on the subjective valuations of other market participants. A depreciated tool may nonetheless become  more valuable if a new use for it is discovered and it turns out to be in short supply. Rotted food may command a higher price as compost — perhaps there is a dire compost shortage — or maybe it is discovered that it actually tastes  better at a certain maturity. Clothes, jewellery, or real estate might come back into fashion and appreciate just as easily as they once went out.</p><p> 我们立即遇到问题：请注意，是否有任何此类项目“保留其购买力”正准备遵守我们承认我们无法预测的变化。它是间接和行为，并取决于其他市场参与者的主观估值。如果发现新用途，则折旧工具可能更有价值，并且事实证明在供不应之规。腐烂的食物可以命令较高的价格作为堆肥 - 也许有一个可怕的堆肥短缺 - 或者也许发现它实际上在一定的时间内更好地味道。衣服，珠宝或房地产可能会像他们曾经出去一样轻松地回到时尚，并欣赏。</p><p> There is yet another difficulty: surely, we want a failure to maintain purchasing power to capture some way in which the money ends up being valued less relative to what we might want to purchase, but not some way in which everything else ends up costing more? In other words, that the money is less useful, not that everything else is more useful. In the latter case — say a war or a natural disaster that causes all real costs to soar — it hardly seems reasonable to describe the probable resultant price increases in terms of money’s decline in value rather than on things having become much more costly to produce. Taken to an extreme, it seems nonsensical to expect that money’s ability to “store value” will entitle its holder to consume some good that may not even end up being produced — or some quantity of goods greater than everything that  is produced.</p><p> 还有另一个困难：当然，我们希望未能维持购买力以捕捉某种方式，其中金钱最终与我们想要购买的东西的重视较少，但不是某种方式最终耗费了更多的方式？换句话说，这笔钱不太有用，而不是其他一切都更有用。在后一种情况下 - 说出战争或自然灾害，导致所有真正的成本飙升 - 描述可能的合理价格在金钱的价值下降方面的下降而不是变得更昂贵的东西。被带到极端，似乎很荒谬，预计金钱的“储存价值”的能力将有权消耗一些可能甚至没有生成的好处 - 或者一定数量的商品大于所产生的一切。</p><p> But it gets even worse: what if an entirely new good or service is invented over the period across which we intend to maintain purchasing power? Has our candidate money’s purchasing power increased  infinitely? What if a good stops being produced or sold on the market altogether? Has our purchasing power decreased infinitely? What to make of all this?</p><p> 但它变得更糟：如果在我们打算维持购买力的时期发明的全新的好或服务，那么如果发明的完全新的好或服务是什么？我们的候选金钱的购买力是否有限增加？如果在市场上生产或销售市场的好停止怎么办？我们的购买力无限减少吗？这一切是什么？</p><p> It might have first seemed natural to mean specifically that a candidate money “retains purchasing power” if, at t0, it can purchase a given quantity of every other good or service in the market, then, at t1, it can still purchase this same quantity in each case. Upon probing, however, this seems naïve — in the case of a new invention, “infinite” seems an amusing but entirely unhelpful answer. In the case of natural disaster, we can’t expect to purchase the same amount because we can’t expect there to have been  produced the same amount, which seems not to be a negative attribute of the money, but rather the money accurately reflecting a negative change in the economic network. Perhaps we could track the changes in a “basket” of goods, but then how do we decide how to weight the inputs and how do we adjust for quality improvements? Any choice will be arbitrary and will better reflect the reality of some economic actors than others.</p><p> 它可能首先似乎是自然的，特别是候选人“保留购买力”如果在T0，它可以在市场上购买给定数量的市场，那么，在T1，它仍然可以购买这一点每种情况的数量。然而，在探索时，这似乎是天真的 - 在一个新的发明的情况下，“无限”似乎有趣但完全无益的答案。在自然灾害的情况下，我们无法期望购买相同的金额，因为我们无法期望在那里产生相同的金额，这似乎不是金钱的负面属性，而是准确反映的金钱经济网络的负面变化。也许我们可以跟踪货物“篮子”的变化，但是我们如何决定如何重量输入以及如何调整质量改进？任何选择都将是任意的，更好地反映出一些经济行为者的现实。</p><p> But even in what we might think of as more “regular” or “normal” economic circumstances, it proves tricky to pin down. Imagine that some good, a widget, hasn’t changed at all between t0 and t1, but that some new invention, a fidget, has superseded it. Nobody wants widgets anymore because fidgets are far better, so widget makers stop producing widgets, and the suppliers to widget makers stop producing widget-making-squidgets too. Now, with nobody making squidgets, it becomes very expensive to make widgets and although far, far fewer are made, their price becomes much higher than at t0, pre-fidget. So, has the money with which all these prices have been quoted “lost purchasing power”?</p><p> 但即使在我们可能认为更“常规”或“正常”的经济状况中，它也证明了贴在下来。想象一下，一些好的小部件，窗口小部件在T0和T1之间没有改变，但是这一些新发明是一种烦恼已经取代它。没有人想要小部件了，因为乱象更好，所以小部件制造商停止生产小部件，并提供给小部件制造商的供应商也停止生产小部件制作鱿鱼。现在，没有人制作鱿鱼，使小部件变得非常昂贵，虽然远远较少，但它们的价格远远高于T0，预感。那么，所有这些价格都引用了“损失购买力”的钱？ </p><p> If you still want to buy widgets, then yes, you have lost desirable purchasing power. If you prefer fidgets, then no, you have gained purchasing power. But crucially, these are connected at root by decisions to shift real, scarce resources from producing one good to another. Hoping for an answer that can be sensibly relative only to our individual demands is myopic because the prices will be dictated by the aggregation of  all demands (and for that matter, all supplies — people who  sell widgets and squidgets have a stake in this too!). If  any demands or supplies change — due to discovery, taste, costs or opportunity costs elsewhere — any circumstance or behavior anywhere — then the allocation of scarce resources to try to match supply to demand will almost certainly change too, and in a way that will wrap back around eventually to affect the original demands and supplies.</p><p>如果您仍然想购买小部件，那么是的，您已经失去了理想的购买力。如果您更喜欢烦恼，那么不，您已经获得了购买力。但至关重要，这些通过决定以root转移，从而改变真实的，稀缺资源生产一个良好的资源。希望答案可以明智地相对于我们的个人需求是近视，因为价格将被所有要求的聚合所规定（以及此事，所有供应 - 销售小部件和鱿鱼的人也有股份！ ）。如果有任何要求或供应改变 - 由于发现，品味，成本或机会成本，在其他地方 - 任何地方的情况或行为 - 那么稀缺资源的分配就会尝试匹配需求，几乎肯定会发生变化，并以一种方式变化最终包裹回来影响原始需求和用品。</p><p> Can we grapple with this? And can we coherently describe  why it is difficult to grapple with? Even before resolving this, it is worth pointing out that money itself will be subject to these same forces — it will just be a lot less natural to point out whenever there is no legitimate monetary competition because we are using it as our measure in the first place. The binaries of the semantic theory seem to absolutely apply. This money  would be a unit of account, and while we can assess  how it is accounting for units, it means little to ask if it is doing so  well: well relative to what?</p><p> 我们可以抓住这个吗？我们可以连贯地描述为什么难以抓住的原因？即使在解决这一点之前，值得指出，金钱本身将受到这些同样的影响 - 只要没有合法的货币竞争，就会有很多自然的自然，因为我们在第一次使用它作为我们的措施地方。语义理论的二进制文件似乎绝对适用。这笔钱将是一个账户单位，而我们可以评估它的核算方式，这意味着很少有人询问是否如此良好：相对于什么？</p><p> But were a new money to emerge, it would naturally have to emerge in a specific place, at a specific time, in a given locality of the economic network. It would not appear everywhere, all at once, and hence could not be helpfully described as providing utility as a “unit of account” from its beginnings — although, in the long run, being  global certainly wouldn’t hurt its chances in this regard ...</p><p> 但是是一个新的钱来，它自然必须在特定时间内在经济网络的特定时间内出现特定的地方。一切都不会出现在任何地方，因此无法有助于从其开始的“账户单位”提供实用性 - 尽管从长远来看，全球肯定不会伤害这方面的机会......</p><p> It would present different utilities to different people depending on their circumstances, their behaviors, their beliefs, and its price. Its entry into the web of supply and demand would change the allocation of scarce resources in ways that would wrap back around and eventually affect its own supply and demand. Hoping for an explanation of its value that can be sensibly relative to individual demands is myopic.</p><p> 根据他们的情况，他们的行为，信仰和价格，它将对不同的人提供不同的公用事业。它进入供需网络的进入供应和需求将改变稀缺资源的方式，这些方式将围绕其包装并最终影响自己的供需。希望解释其具有可明智的相对于个人需求的价值是近视。</p><p> What it would seem like if it did seem like a new money were emerging would be widely disparate views, rapid change, and no consensus, with sentiment ebbing and flowing unpredictably as the relative merits of the promise of future certainty from the challenger and the supposed failures of this promise from the incumbent were constantly being weighed and re-weighed by the market.</p><p> 如果它看起来似乎是新的金钱，那么新的钱将是广泛的观点，快速变化，无共识，情绪消退和流动不可预测，作为未来挑战者和假设未来确定性的相对优点从现任者那里的这种承诺的失败是不断称重和重新称重市场。</p><p>   Have you ever played  The Triangle Game? Here’s what you do: get in a big group and instruct everybody to mill around aimlessly. While this is happening, instruct everybody to pick two other people, but keep their choice to themselves. Then, on a signal, tell everybody to move to form an equilateral triangle with the two people they chose. Then, watch chaos ensue. Even if the activity of the network as a whole ever seems to calm down, it can just as easily spiral out of control again with one step because one person moving may be reacted to by others, which may be reacted to by others still, and so on. Every individual decision has effects that permeate unpredictably through the entire network, unevenly over time, while every individual decision-maker is only immediately aware of the dynamics in their small locality, just like in a network of economic exchange.</p><p>   你有没有演奏三角游戏？这就是你所做的：进入一个大群，并指示每个人漫无目的地碾磨。虽然这发生了，但指示每个人都挑选另外两个人，但保持自己的选择。然后，在一个信号上，告诉每个人都可以搬到一个他们选择的两个人的等边三角形。然后，看起来混乱随之而来。即使网络的活动整体似乎平静下来，它也可以轻松地再次剥离一个步骤，因为一个人移动可能对其他人反应，这可能是由其他人反应的很快。每一个决策都有影响通过整个网络不可预测，随着时间的推移不均匀，而每个决策者只会立即意识到他们的小型地点的动态，就像在经济交换网络中一样。</p><p> Asking an individual to evaluate an invariant of the economic aggregate in terms of only their own supplies and demands is rather like asking a participant in The Tr</p><p> 要求个人在只有自己的用品和需求方面评估经济总量的不变性，而不是询问TR的参与​​者 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/wittgensteins-money-7cac8d0635cf">https://allenfarrington.medium.com/wittgensteins-money-7cac8d0635cf</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/金钱/">#金钱</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
