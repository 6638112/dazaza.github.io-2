Bloated, curvaceous structures — engineered by the same people who designed Corvette Stingrays and Yes album covers — built out of shiny fiberglass, pristine chrome, and pulsating neon light -- Tomorrow&#39;s city would be a Space Age coral reef, teeming with millions of funky life forms, its limitless nooks and enclaves seething with parties, discos, arcades, and mind-blowing good times....</p><p>我所知道的一切：将来，所有城市看起来都将像Kaptain Kool＆amp;周六上午的科罗夫超级秀（Krofft Supershow）膨胀的，弯曲的结构-由设计Corvette Stingrays和Yes专辑封面的人设计-由闪亮的玻璃纤维，原始铬和脉动的霓虹灯建造-明天的城市将是太空时代的珊瑚礁，到处都是数以百万计的时髦生活形式，其无限的角落和飞地与聚会，迪斯科舞厅，拱廊和令人陶醉的美好时光交织在一起。</p><p> My van would be more than just a mode of transportation... It would be my spaceship for navigating the Strip.			 				The Strip would eventually encompass the world. Domed cities would interconnect across continents , and hamster-tube highways would extend down into the ocean so that you could cruise the aquatic sea-cities. 			 				Your van could literally take you anywhere on Planet Earth. Maybe not as fast as a Concorde jet, but speed wasn&#39;t important. Getting there was all the fun.</p><p> 我的货车不仅仅只是一种运输方式……这将是我在太空地带航行的飞船。地带最终将包围整个世界。圆顶城市将在各大洲之间相互连接，仓鼠管高速公路将向下延伸到海洋中，以便您可以游览水上的海洋城市。您的货车实际上可以将您带到地球上的任何地方。也许没有协和飞机快，但速度并不重要。到达那里很有趣。</p><p> What I would be doing for a living? I didn&#39;t care. According OMNI magazine, the technological changes of the 			Eighties were going to be so  vast, so  profound, that the job market would be unrecognizable by the time I entered the workforce.			   				Nearly any job I trained for now would be obsolete by 1990. Computers and solar-powered robot factories would be doing most of the work. Consumer goods would be mostly free, and the U.N. would be paying us all not to work.</p><p> 我会做什么谋生？我不在乎。根据《 OMNI》杂志的报道，八十年代的技术变革将是如此巨大，如此深刻，以至我进入劳动力市场时，就业市场将变得不可识别。我现在接受培训的几乎所有工作到1990年都会过时。计算机和太阳能机器人工厂将完成大部分工作。消费品基本上都是免费的，联合国将支付我们所有人不工作的钱。</p><p> The important things in human life — sex, technology, hedonism, and the peaceful exploration of inner and outer space — these would occupy most of our time as a new Golden Age dawned for humanity. No matter where you went, you would find millions of groovy freaks boogying down, partying hearty, and tossing off symphonies, rocketship designs, and cures for cancer as freely as a tree drops fruit. Human civilization would have truly begun....</p><p> 人类生活中的重要事物-性，技术，享乐主义以及对内外太空的和平探索-随着人类进入新的黄金时代，这些将占据我们的大部分时间。无论您走到哪里，都会发现数以百万计的怪异怪胎在喧嚣中奔腾，狂欢，并扔掉交响曲，飞船设计并像树木掉落的果实一样免费治愈癌症。人类文明将真正开始……</p><p>      Sure, I  could&#39;ve opened the door, but what good would that have done? 			   				What could I tell them, except that I didn&#39;t have the rent? 			   				And what could they say to me, except to remind me of what a  loser I am? 		   			I already  know I&#39;m a loser. The fact is well established and needs no further elaboration.</p><p>      当然，我可以打开门，但是这样做有什么好处？除了没房租外，我还能告诉他们什么？他们能对我说什么，除了让我想起我是个失败者？我已经知道我是失败者。事实已充分确立，无需进一步阐述。</p><p>    Someday I&#39;m going to break my leg doing that... Which would be bad, since I have no health insurance...			  I do, however, have a job. It just doesn&#39;t  pay enough.  I&#39;m not going anywhere in particular. I just have to lose myself in the suburbs for a few hours. I&#39;ll creep back later in the day. Hopefully my housemates will be gone and I can sneak back into my room.</p><p>    总有一天，我会为此折断腿……这很不好，因为我没有健康保险……但是，我确实有一份工作。它只是支付不了足够的钱。我不会去任何地方。我只需要在郊区迷失几个小时。我将在当天晚些时候爬回去。希望我的室友走了，我可以偷偷回到我的房间。</p><p> Then again, maybe today will be the day I come back and find all my belongings set out by the  dumpster.						  That day  will come. It&#39;s inevitable. My housemates&#39; patience has surely reached its limit.</p><p> 再说一次，也许今天是我回来找垃圾箱列出的所有物品的日子。那天会到。这是不可避免的。我的室友耐心肯定已达到极限。 </p><p> When school ended last month, I had to live  somewhere. Of course, with a terrible credit rating like mine,			(that trail of busted credit cards littering my passage through an &#34;academic career&#34;) and no money for a deposit, 			it wouldn&#39;t be easy to find a place. 			  			My current housemates, fortunately, didn&#39;t check my credit or ask for anything upfront... they naively assumed that since I was in college, I must be a solvent young bourgeois like themselves.  I did nothing to disabuse them of this illusion.</p><p>上个月学校放学后，我不得不住在某个地方。当然，有了像我这样的糟糕信用评级（那破烂信用卡的痕迹在我的学术生涯中流连忘返），而且没有存款的钱，要找到它就不容易了一个地方。幸运的是，我现在的室友们没有检查我的信誉或没有要求任何事情……他们天真的认为自从我上大学以来，我就必须像自己一样是一个有偿付能力的年轻资产阶级。我没有采取任何行动使他们摆脱这种幻想。</p><p> I&#39;m neither ashamed nor proud of myself.  Like a rodent, I&#39;ve simply done what I&#39;ve needed to do to stay alive,  moment to moment.  I feel miscast in this role, but here I am.</p><p> 我既不为自己感到羞耻也不为自己感到骄傲。像啮齿动物一样，我只是简单地做了一些我需要做的事情，以保持生命的每时每刻。我对这个角色误以为是，但是我在这里。</p><p> The locale I&#39;m trapped in is  Santa Luna, California, a sleepy seaside college town situated 50 miles west of Silicon Valley. If exciting things are happening in Silicon Valley, you surely won&#39;t hear about them here. Santa Luna is its own self-contained bubble reality, a sort of hippy-dippy alternate universe that might have branched off from oursif McGovern had won the 1972 presidential election.   Tourists call this town &#34;charming.&#34; For me, being stuck here after I&#39;ve graduatedfeels a lot like bathing in my own urine.</p><p> 我被困的地点是加利福尼亚州的圣塔露娜市，这是一个位于硅谷以西50英里处的安静的海滨大学城。如果硅谷发生了令人兴奋的事情，那么您肯定不会在这里听到它们。圣塔露娜是其自身独立的泡泡现实，如果麦戈文赢得了1972年总统大选，这可能是一种嬉皮士般的交替宇宙，可能会从我们的分支中分离出来。游客称此镇为“迷人”。对我来说，毕业后被困在这里就像是在自己的尿中洗澡一样。</p><p>  Out on the edge of town, where the freeway meets the warehouse district, Santa Luna&#39;s homeless people live.</p><p>  在高速公路与仓库区交汇的城镇边缘，Santa Luna的无家可归者生活在这里。</p><p> Excluded from the industrial lifestyle of modern humanity — and yet denied even the simple dignity of  animals — theirs, I was certain, must be the  worst of all possible worlds.</p><p> 被现代人类的工业生活方式排除在外，但甚至否认动物的简单尊严，我敢肯定，它们的动物一定是所有可能世界中最糟糕的。</p><p>            For those of you who either weren&#39;t alive, or weren&#39;t paying attention at the time:  Back in 1983 an old acidhead named William Gibson sat down at hisHermes 3000 manual typewriter and banged out what was to becomethe most popular science fiction novel of that decade...  Concerning people plugging their brains directly into theircomputers, Gibson&#39;s novel was originally titled  Jacked In.  The publishers feared this sounded too much like &#34;jacked off&#34;,and changed the title to a more marketable  Neuromancer.</p><p>            对于那些当时还活着或者没有注意的人：早在1983年，一位名叫威廉·吉布森（William Gibson）的老酸头匠就在他的爱马仕3000手动打字机上坐下来，狂跳着什么成为最受欢迎的打字机吉布森的这本小说是关于那十年的科幻小说...关于人们将大脑直接插入计算机，这本小说的原名是《杰克在》。出版商担心这听起来太像“劫机”，因此将标题更改为更具市场价值的Neuromancer。</p><p> This little book of his was to cause quite a stir...   Neuromancer had a tremendous cultural impact, not the least of which was the introduction of a new word into the English language —   cyberspace.  In subsequent years, the prefix &#34;cyber-&#34; sort of broke off and did its own  thing...</p><p> 他的这本小书引起了极大的轰动。Neuromancer产生了巨大的文化影响，其中最重要的就是将一个新词引入英语-网络空间。在随后的几年中，前缀＆＃34; cyber-＆＃34;有点破裂并做了自己的事... </p><p> Which brings us to the year 1993 and the first annual  “Cyber Expo.”  For the past few years I had been reading about a newly emerging   “cyberculture” in exciting new magazines with names like  Phringe Surfer, FutureShock, Cyborgasm, Digital Frontier, and  Fast Forward.  In May of 1993 I scraped together my month&#39;s grocery money and made the Greyhound bus trip to San Francisco. I was  finally going to meet the movers and shakers of this cyberculture face to face!Smart drug entrepreneurs, multimedia artists, hackers, inventors of mindblowing new technologies, all would be congregating here in this one space.</p><p>这使我们进入了1993年和第一届年度“网络博览会”。在过去的几年中，我一直在令人振奋的新杂志中阅读有关新兴的“网络文化”的信息，这些杂志的名称包括Phringe Surfer，FutureShock，Cyborgasm，Digital Frontier和Fast Forward。 1993年5月，我凑齐了当月的杂货费，乘坐灵狮巴士去了旧金山。我终于要面对这种网络文化的推动者和摇动者！聪明的毒品企业家，多媒体艺术家，黑客，令人鼓舞新技术的发明者，都将聚集在这一领域。</p><p> It was already 1993, and the future I&#39;d imagined in 1978 was running a little behind schedule.  Was it possible that here and now, the future was off to a proper start?  Would I finally find the community I&#39;d always hoped for?    Would I, at last, discover “my” people?</p><p> 已经是1993年，而我在1978年所想象的未来却落后于计划。现在和现在，未来是否有可能是一个适当的开始？我最终会找到我一直希望的社区吗？最后，我会发现“我的”人吗？</p><p>  The presentation was called “Cyber Revolution: Power to the People” and it was attended by some of the hippest of the California &#34;Digerati&#34;.  I took the opportunity to buttonhole an editor I&#39;d been petitioning for several months. His name was Sparky West and he was editor-in-chief of  Fast Forward, one of the seminal cyberculture magazines.  Their motto:  &#34;Made for the Smartest People on Earth.&#34;  (Yes,  I know. That should have been my first warning.)</p><p>  该演讲被称为“网络革命：人民的力量”，加利福尼亚的一些最时髦的人参加了演讲。我借此机会扣留了一个已经请愿了几个月的编辑。他的名字叫Sparky West，他是网络文化开创性杂志之一《快进》的主编。他们的座右铭是：“为地球上最聪明的人而努力”。 （是的，我知道。那应该是我的第一个警告。）</p><p>                         I went to a seedy bar across the street from the convention center and drank my first beer... quickly followed by my second, my third and 		my  fourth.  When I came back later that evening, Cyber Expo &#39;93 had transformed into an enormous &#34;rave&#34; party.  808 and Guinness proved to be a bad mix; but then, I wasn&#39;t really in a partying mood to begin with.</p><p>                         我去了会议中心对面一条肮脏的酒吧，喝了我的第一杯啤酒……很快就喝了第二杯，第三杯和第四杯。当我那天晚上晚些时候回来时，Cyber​​ Expo＆＃39;变成了一个巨大的＆＃34; rave＆＃34;。派对。 808和吉尼斯证明是不好的组合；但是后来，我并不是真的很喜欢聚会。</p><p> It was a crowded bathroom, as bathrooms usually are at these events... Stoned ravers stampeding in to empty their bladders of all the $7-a-bottle mountain-spring water and “smart-drinks” they&#39;ve been guzzling on the dancefloor.   I knew I was taking more than my fair timeshare in this stall, so I wasn&#39;t too surprised when this random guy came barging in..... obviously needing the toilet for the same reasons I did...   (Readers of delicate sensibility may wish to abandon the narrative at this point...)</p><p> 这是一个拥挤的浴室，因为通常是在这些事件中洗手间。...扔石头的流浪者踩着水倒空了他们一直在狂饮的每瓶7美元的山泉水和“智能饮料”的膀胱。舞池。我知道我在这个摊位里花了比我应得的更多的时光，所以当这个随便的家伙闯进来时，我并不感到惊讶……出于与我同样的原因显然需要上厕所……（读者敏感的人不妨在此放弃叙述...）</p><p>      I kept imagining I&#39;d strike up a conversation  with some cool people and get myself  invitedto a  cyber-party.....</p><p>      我一直在想与一些很酷的人进行对话，并邀请自己参加网络派对。</p><p> Once there, I&#39;d meet the woman of my dreams... Some futuristic cyber-babe, who&#39;d blow my mind and leave my soul aching for new adventures....</p><p> 到达那里后，我会遇到我梦dream以求的女人...一些未来派的网络婴儿，他会打动我的心，让我的灵魂渴望新的冒险...。 </p><p> Later, we&#39;d drop acid and have 12 hours of Tantric sex,  after which she&#39;d tutor me in Video Toaster and give me a job as creative director of her startup  smart drink company...</p><p>后来，我们滴了酸，进行了12个小时的密宗性爱，之后她在Video Toaster上教我，并给我担任了她的创业智能饮料公司的创意总监的工作...</p><p>   I can&#39;t tell you how much that magazine of yours inspired me. I suffered through every suck job in college just dreaming of the day I&#39;d finally get to jack into  cyberspace.</p><p>   我不能告诉你你那本杂志给我的启发有多大。我在大学里经历了每一次糟糕的工作，只是梦见自己终于进入网络空间的那一天。</p><p> From the moment I read about the existence of the Cyberculture, I wanted to be a  part of it.  The people you described in your magazine —all those hackers, freaks and revolutionaries —Each of them was exactly the kind of person I wanted to   become.A sort of hypersexed, optimistic genius....A cross between  Buckminster Fuller and   Ziggy Stardust.  They all seemed so wise and good-natured — The mirror-opposite of the greedy,narrow-minded Yuppies who personified the Eighties.</p><p> 从我了解网络文化的存在的那一刻起，我就想成为其中的一份子。您在杂志中描述的人-所有这些黑客，怪胎和革命家-每个人都是我想要成为的那种人。一种过分激昂，乐观的天才...。在Buckminster Fuller和Ziggy Stardust之间是一个十字架。他们似乎都那么明智和善良-代表八十年代的贪婪，狭min的雅皮士的镜像对面。</p><p> And now that I&#39;ve met these people in  real-life, what have I discovered?  This &#34;cyberculture&#34; is nothing more than an elite club of middle-class   snots showing offtheir toys to each other.   I&#39;d hoped the Nineties cyberculture was going to be the antidote to that mean-spirited  materialism of the Eighties...   But it turns out they&#39;re even   worse!!!</p><p> 现在，我已经在现实生活中认识了这些人，我发现了什么？这种网络文化无非就是一个中产阶级鼻屎精英俱乐部，互相展示玩具。我希望九十年代的网络文化将成为八十年代那种刻薄的唯物主义的解药...但是事实证明，他们甚至更糟！！！</p><p>                    As it turned out, I  didn&#39;t buy the damned computer... I went ahead and finished my final year of school.			  I still remember that glow of pride I felt, that weekend in May 1994, when they handed me my diploma...I&#39;d set my mind on a goal, worked at it, and  completed it. 	  For the first time in my life, I had   accomplished something.</p><p>                    事实证明，我没有买那台该死的计算机……我继续学习并完成了最后一年的学业。我仍然记得1994年5月的那个周末，当他们把文凭交给我时，我感到很自豪……我立志于一个目标，为之奋斗并完成了它。这是我一生中第一次成就自己。</p><p>  Getting back to that day when I jumped out the window....When I crept back home that afternoon I was thrilled to discover — hallelujah! — my belongings hadn&#39;t been thrown out by the dumpster!  However, there  were people home.</p><p>  回到那天，当我跳出窗户。...当我那天下午回到家时，我很高兴发现-哈利路亚！ —我的财物没有被垃圾箱扔掉！但是，有人回家。</p><p> I wandered the suburbs and circled back several times that evening. Finally, around midnight, all the lights were off. Deciding it was safe, I snuck back in and slept...  ....For a few hours, at least. Then I had to get up at 4:00 am to go work at the bakery.</p><p> 我在郊区徘徊，并于当晚转了几圈。终于，在午夜前后，所有的灯都熄灭了。觉得很安全，我偷偷溜回去睡了……至少几个小时。然后我不得不在凌晨4:00起来在面包店上班。 </p><p> I didn&#39;t mind the job so much. It was gruelling work, physically demanding, not a second&#39;s rest for the whole 8 hours... but it had its positive aspects.  I could eat all the free muffins and coffee I wanted. Needless to say, muffins and coffee were the staple of my diet that summer .  More importantly, I was too busy to  think about what a disaster my life had become.</p><p>我不太介意这份工作。这是艰苦的工作，身体上要求很高，整个8个小时都没有休息……但是它有积极的方面。我可以吃我想要的所有免费松饼和咖啡。不用说，松饼和咖啡是那个夏天我饮食的主食。更重要的是，我太忙了，无法思考我的生活已成为一场灾难。</p><p> The agonizing introspection came every afternoon at 1 p.m., when I got off work.  I&#39;d walk home, and even under the blazing summer sun, I shivered with sick dread, my stomach tied in knots by coffee and fear.... the fear that I should get home and  today would be the day when I would have to fish my belongings out of the dumpster and go join the homeless camp on the edge of town.</p><p> 当我下班时，每天下午1时，都会感到痛苦的内省。我步行回家，即使在炎热的夏日阳光下，我也因生病的恐惧而瑟瑟发抖，我的肚子因咖啡和恐惧而被打结……。担心我要回家了，今天将是那天不得不将我的物品从垃圾箱中捞出来，然后加入城镇边缘的无家可归者营地。</p><p> If nobody was home, I&#39;d sneak up to my room, lock the door, and pretend not to be home. This meant I couldn&#39;t turn on the lights at night, but since it was summer the sunlight usually lasted past 8 p.m..  Besides, since I had to get up at 4 a.m. to go to work, it was best if I went to sleep by 8 o&#39;clock anyway.</p><p> 如果没有人在家，我会偷偷溜到我的房间，锁上门，假装不在家。这意味着我无法在晚上打开电灯，但是由于是夏天，阳光通常会持续到晚上8点以后。此外，由于我必须在凌晨4点起床去上班，所以最好还是去无论如何要在8点之前入睡。</p><p> Those days were rare, however.  Usually when I came home straight from work, there would be people there, and so I&#39;d have to sneak quietly away. I&#39;d set off on a random direction and wander the suburbs for a few hours, eventually circling back home to check again. Some days I would do this three, four, even five times, not sneaking back in until after midnight when my housemates were asleep.  There was nowhere else for me to spend time. I had no books toread (I&#39;d sold them already) and I couldn&#39;t spare the 10 lousybucks to join the city library. I had no money to take the busanywhere, and I didn&#39;t even have the spare change to buy a cup ofcoffee and sit in a coffeehouse all day long.</p><p> 但是，那些日子很少见。通常，当我下班回家时，那里会有人，所以我必须悄悄溜走。我朝一个随机的方向出发，在郊区闲逛了几个小时，最后绕回家再次检查。有时候，我会做三，四，甚至五次，直到午夜之后我的室友们睡着了才偷偷溜回来。我没有其他地方可以花时间了。我没有要读书的书（我已经卖掉了），而且我不能不花10卢比钱去市图书馆。我没有钱去公共汽车站，而且我什至没有多余的零钱买一杯咖啡，整天坐在咖啡屋里。</p><p> I couldn&#39;t remember a time in my life when I&#39;d been more disgusted with myself. I wondered what my 10-year-old self would have thought if he could see the 26-year-old fuckup he was destined to become.</p><p> 我不记得我生命中的某个时候对自己更加反感。我想知道我10岁的自己会不会想，如果他能看到他注定要成为的26岁的混蛋。</p><p> Now I  know what you&#39;re thinking: 		Why didn&#39;t this  dumb-ass use his free time to look for a  higher-paying job?    		The short answer: there   were none. 				   					Santa Luna&#39;s economy is		propped up by students and tourists. 				As a freshly-graduated B.A. with zero professional experience, you essentially had two job options in this town:		Sell  t-shirts at the wharf, or scoop  muffins. 		  		And since you can&#39;t eat t-shirts when the boss isn&#39;t looking, that made my choice pretty  easy.</p><p> 现在，我知道您在想什么：这个笨蛋为什么不利用他的空闲时间来寻找薪水更高的工作？简短的答案：没有。学生和游客支撑着圣卢纳（Santa Luna）的经济。作为一个刚毕业的学士学位拥有零的专业经验，您在这个小镇上基本上有两种工作选择：在码头上卖T恤，或在勺子上买松饼。而且由于老板不在时您不能吃T恤，所以我的选择非常容易。</p><p> To my credit, I   did sign up last year with a temp agency over in Silicon Valley.			I was more than willing to make the 50-mile bus commute every day if they could place me in a decent-paying		 data entry or  mail-sorting job. 				  		I did pretty good on the typing and math tests, but even so.....</p><p> 值得称赞的是，我去年确实在硅谷与一家临时机构签约。如果他们可以让我从事一份体面的数据输入或邮件分拣工作，我每天都愿意让50英里的公共汽车上下班。我在打字和数学测试方面做得很好，但即使如此..... </p><p> So,   really — I had nothing else to do but wander.   Still, these aimless hours in the suburban desert did afford me the time to look at my life and figure out where and how I had fucked up so badly....  What had I done to bring my life to this low point?</p><p>所以，真的-除了徘徊，我别无选择。尽管如此，在郊区的沙漠中漫长的漫长时光仍然让我有时间去看待我的生活，弄清楚我在哪里和如何做得如此糟糕……。为了使我的生活达到这个低谷，我做了什么？</p><p> I thought back to 1978... If I had been so obsessed with the future, why hadn&#39;t I  planned it better?  Why hadn&#39;t I started saving money?  Why hadn&#39;t I planned my finances and my college career?  Answer: Because I didn&#39;t think there was any   need to.</p><p> 我回想起1978年...如果我对未来如此着迷，为什么没有更好地计划呢？为什么我没有开始存钱？为什么我没有计划自己的财务和大学生涯？答：因为我认为没有必要。</p><p> Somewhere the seed of  fatalism had been planted in my young mind.  The Future wasn&#39;t something I would have to plan or build or work for. I believed the Future was going to be  created for me by benevolent corporations...  All I had to do was stay alive long enough to  inhabit it.</p><p> 宿命论的种子播种在我年轻的脑海中。未来不是我必须计划，建造或工作的东西。我相信，美好的公司将为我创造未来。我要做的就是活到足够长的时间来居住它。</p><p> At the appointed time, Our Benevolent Corporate Patriarchs would &#34;lift the curtains&#34; and invite us all into the wondrous Future they&#39;d made ready for us.   We&#39;d   all be welcome; the Future, by its very nature, was cheerful and  inclusive.  In the meantime, while they were getting it all ready,the corporations would allow us to experience the Future in short, controlled bursts, such as the World&#39;s Fair Expo, or Disney World&#39;s Tommorowland.</p><p> 在指定的时间，我们的仁慈企业祖先将＆＃34;拉开帷幕＆＃34;并邀请我们所有人进入为我们准备的奇妙的未来。我们都将受到欢迎；就其本质而言，未来是充满欢乐和包容的。同时，在他们准备就绪的同时，这些公司将允许我们在可控的短暂时间内体验“未来”，例如世界博览会，迪斯尼乐园的Tommorowland。</p><p> It simply never occurred to me that I would be denied anything I wanted or  needed....</p><p> 我从来没有想到我会被拒绝任何我想要或需要的东西。</p><p> It was all hilarious in retrospect, and I cherished that gratifying sense of  liberation I felt uprooting these delusions from my mind...  This didn&#39;t change the essential fact that the month of  August was swiftly approaching, and I still hadn&#39;t yet payed  July&#39;s rent.   I was  doomed, but I just couldn&#39;t care anymore. I had done my best, and my best had proven, ultimately, not to be good enough. So mote it be.Low blood sugar makes fatalists of us all.</p><p> 回想起来，这一切都很搞笑。我珍惜那种令人欣喜的解放感，使我摆脱了这些妄想。这并没有改变一个基本事实，那就是八月正迅速到来，而我仍然没有39; t尚未支付7月份的租金。我注定要失败，但是我已经不在乎了。我已经尽力了，但最终我的努力证明了自己还不够好。低血糖是我们所有人的宿命论者。</p><p> Nevertheless, by some miracle I kept my housemates pacified for the duration of July.They didn&#39;t like me very much, and they called me every hateful name in the book, but to their credit they never threatened to evict me outright.  I only had to jump out of my bedroom window two more times that month.  Meanwhile August continued its damnable approach....</p><p> 尽管如此，我还是奇迹般地让我的室友们在7月的期间内安抚下来。他们并不十分喜欢我，他们在书中称呼我每个可恨的名字，但值得称赞的是他们从未威胁要彻底驱逐我。那个月我只需要跳出卧室窗户两次。同时，八月继续采取该死的做法。 </p><p> Sunday, August 1, 1994.  The day everything changed.  I was perversely happy that afternoon.I&#39;d just finished my shift at work,the sun was shining hot upon the Earth,I had the next two days off, and, most importantly, today was  payday.I&#39;d cashed my paycheck out of the bakery register and was on my way to the grocery store, visions of scrumptious foodstuffs dancing in my head.  I was dimly aware that I didn&#39;t have August&#39;s rent, but that unpleasant fact was too far up my Hierarchy of Needs to trouble me much just then.All that mattered was   I&#39;d be eating a hot meal tonight..... and whenyou&#39;re starving even the  promise of food puts a bounce in your step.</p><p>1994年8月1日，星期日。那天一切都变了。那天下午我很不愉快。我刚完成工作，我的阳光照在了地球上，接下来的两天就放假了，最重要的是今天是发薪日。我从面包店的收银台上兑现了我的薪水，然后去杂货店，途中，美味的食物在我脑海中荡漾。我隐约意识到自己没有八月的房租，但那令人不快的事实太过严重了，我的需求层次令我不胜其烦。今晚吃热饭.....而当您饿死时，即使食物的承诺也会使您的步伐反弹。</p><p> I found myself strolling past a yardsale. where something caught my eye....  A  typewriter....  A  manual typewriter...  And not just any manual typewriter, but a 1962  Hermes 3000.  The same model which William Gibson wrote  Neuromancer on.</p><p> 我发现自己走过一条杂货店。那里的东西吸引了我的目光...打字机...手动打字机...不仅是任何手动打字机，还有一台1962年的爱马仕3000。威廉·吉布森（William Gibson）在上面写的Neuromancer型号。</p><p> On closer inspection, the Hermes turned out to be preposterously ugly.It appeared to have been stolen off the set of the movie  Brazil, or out of some Soviet records office. A more  un-futuristic looking machine would be hard to imagine.  I  had to own it.           Had to.</p><p> 经过仔细检查，结果发现爱马仕（Hermes）丑陋可笑，似乎是从电影《巴西》（Brazil）或苏联一些唱片办公室偷走的。看起来更没有未来感的机器将很难想象。我必须拥有它。必须。</p><p> The old man running the yard sale was only too eager to get rid of the Hermes. In fact, he seemed genuinely angry with himself that he had ever been stupid enough to own such a useless machine.</p><p> 负责院子买卖的老人只急于摆脱爱马仕。实际上，他似乎真的对自己感到生气，因为他曾经愚蠢到拥有如此无用的机器。</p><p> I paid the ten dollars and hauled the typewriter home. Along the way I seemed to be observing myself through an extraterrestrial telescope, wondering at howthis silly creature had just fucked himselfout of a week&#39;s groceries.  You can dodge your housemates, some aloof voice of reason burbled pedantically,  but you can&#39;t dodge your own stomach.  Yeah....  Whatever.   Something more important than mere  eating was going on here. Something  life-shattering. Something   huge.</p><p> 我付了十美元，把打字机拖回了家。一路上，我似乎正在通过一个外星望远镜观察自己，想知道这个愚蠢的生物是如何使自己摆脱了一周的食品杂货的。您可以躲避室友，有些超然的理性声音在书呆子里啪作响，但您不能躲避自己的肚子。好吧，无所谓了。这里发生着比单纯吃饭更重要的事情。令人震惊的生活。巨大的东西。</p><p> I made the usual stealth-approach to my house — cased it, determined there was nobody home, and crept inside....  Only to discover, Scotch-taped to my bedroom door, a plain-white envelope with my name written on it.(I didn&#39;t bother opening it. No point, really.)  There was an old desk in the garage which I dragged singlehandedly up the stairs into my room...</p><p> 我对我的房子做了通常的隐形方法-装上箱子，确定没有人在家，然后潜入里面....才发现，苏格兰人用胶带贴在我的卧室门上，上面写着我的名字的纯白色信封（（我没有费心打开它。真的没有意义。）车库里有一张旧桌子，我单手将它拖上楼梯进入我的房间...</p><p> Crazy angels were singing in my head, welcoming me home.   In the August heat, I  shivered...</p><p> 疯狂的天使在我头上唱歌，欢迎我回家。在八月的酷暑中，我发抖... </p><p> Just like that monkey in  2001: A Space Odyssey, the moment he picks up the zebra thighbone and senses some  next-level shit is about to come down, so too I realized I was on the verge of a crucial  life-change event.</p><p>就像2001年的那只猴子：太空漫游一样，当他拿起斑马大腿骨并感觉到下一层狗屎就要掉下来的那一刻，所以我也意识到我正处在一个至关重要的改变生命的事件的边缘。</p><p> I cranked my diploma into the Hermes, blank side forward, and typed the following sentence....</p><p> 我把文凭扔进了爱马仕（Hermes），空白面朝前，然后输入以下句子...。</p><p>  This ugly little machine, this unholy steel trilobyte of Victorian levers and gears, worked just as well now as it had 32 years ago, the day it was made!  Such simplicity! Such   integrity!</p><p>  这台丑陋的小机器，这是维多利亚时代的杠杆和齿轮的钢制三字节，如今已经和32年前（制造那天）一样运转了！如此简单！如此诚信！</p><p> The more I studied it, the more I realized that the ugliness of the Hermes 3000 was in fact a subtle  beauty....  It wasn&#39;t built to look “Futuristic.’ It was built to squat firmly on a desk and pound out strings of legible  text.   It didn&#39;t sport chrome tail fins. It was not streamlined, nor was it poised for takeoff. It was in no way trying to mimic UNIVAC.</p><p> 我研究得越多，就越意识到爱马仕3000的丑陋实际上是一种微妙的美...。它的外观并不是“未来派”。它牢固地蹲在桌子上，敲出清晰的文字字符串。它没有镀铬尾鳍。它没有被简化，也没有准备起飞。绝不是要模仿UNIVAC。</p><p> There were obviously no marketing experts at Hermes Corporation that year, hawking their special brand of bullshit to the engineers...</p><p> 那一年，爱马仕公司显然没有营销专家，他们把废话的特殊品牌卖给了工程师。</p><p> It was, simply, a machine for typing... and yet it was   more than that...  The medium was also a message...  This typewriter was a signal from a vanished age, its very simplicity and integrity telling me volumes about the people who built it and the lifestyle they led.....</p><p> 简而言之，它只是一台打字机……但不仅限于此……媒体也是一种信息……这台打字机是一个消失的时代的信号，它的简单性和完整性告诉我很多关于建造它的人和他们过着的生活方式.....</p><p> Finally the heat, hunger, delirium, and exhaustion got the better of me.  I passed out...  While sprawled on the floor, I had a  vision....</p><p> 最终，热量，饥饿，ir妄和疲惫使我变得更好。我晕倒了...当我躺在地板上时，我有一个视野...。 </p><p>  It all became perfectly clear to me what I must   do.   Instead of waiting for a future from which I would forever be  excluded, I would instead go   backwards.  I would inhabit the  past.</p><p>这一切对我来说非常清楚，我该做什么。我没有等待一个永远被排除在外的未来，而是倒退了。我会过去。</p><p> I would pretend, to the best of my abilities, 	 		that I was living in the year 1962.		    Fuck the future.</p><p> 我会以自己的最大能力假装我生活在1962年。他妈的未来。</p><p> First thing I&#39;d do is get rid of all those &#34;cyberculture&#34; magazines I&#39;d collected.    		These filthy rags were no longer welcome in my reality.    		The only wholesome use to which they could be put to was to help hobos roast their hot dogs.</p><p> 我要做的第一件事就是摆脱所有那些“网络文化”。我收集的杂志。这些肮脏的破布在我的现实中不再受欢迎。他们唯一有益于健康的用途是帮助流浪汉烤热狗。</p><p> I would reject   all aspects of &#34;The Future.&#34; Especially the clothing. 		  	I&#39;d effect the costume of a mid-20th Century working-class intellectual. 	  	From now on I&#39;d buy all my clothes either at Goodwill or the hardware store.</p><p> 我会拒绝＆＃34; The Future的所有方面。尤其是衣服。我影响了20世纪中叶的工人阶级知识分子。从现在开始，我将在Goodwill或五金店购买我的所有衣服。</p><p>  I would live in an exclusively  pre-1962 musical environment.	  	There was an entire vanished culture — rich, passionate, complex — preserved on vinyl and available for dirt cheap in the used record stores.  I would no longer need to stay on top of the &#34;new&#34; music. I&#39;d listen exclusively to classic jazz and those weird old spoken-word poetry albums.  I would pre</p><p>  我将生活在1962年以前的音乐环境中。乙烯基上保存着一种消失了的完整文化，即丰富，热情，复杂，可以在二手唱片商店中廉价地买到。我不再需要呆在＆＃34; new＆＃34;的顶部。音乐。我将只听古典爵士乐和那些古怪的口语诗歌专辑。我会预</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/">http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/家伙/">#家伙</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/guy/">#guy</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
