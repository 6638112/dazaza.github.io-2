In the half century since its publication, this fierce little book has only tightened its talon grip on us. It reads now as uncannily prophetic: of the  Anthropocene (our geological age, in which human activity is now the dominant influence on the environment), of extinction events, of dark ecology – even of virtual reality. In ancient Rome a  haruspex was a person trained in a form of divination based on inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals. Baker’s book – strewn as it is with eviscerated birds, obsessed as it is with prediction – is a text of killing and foretelling: of seeing the future in blood and guts. It has haruspicated our present, and I suspect its prescience is not yet all used up.</p><p>   贾贝克（J A Baker）的《百富勤（Peregrine）》已有50年历史，但感觉好像是昨天写的。自出版以来的半个世纪中，这本激进的小书仅使我们牢牢抓住了爪子。它现在被解读为难以言喻的预言：人类世（我们的地质时代，人类活动现在对环境的主要影响），灭绝事件，黑暗生态甚至虚拟现实。在古罗马，长尾猿是一种占卜训练的人，其基础是检查被祭牲的内脏。贝克的书-散布着去内脏的鸟类，痴迷于预测-就是杀人和预言的文本：看到血液和胆量的未来。它毁了我们的现在，我怀疑它的先知还没有全部用完。</p><p> The story of  The Peregrine’s writing is remarkable, and has a mystery at its heart. For around a decade – from 1954 to 1964 – a myopic office worker from Essex tracked the peregrine falcons that hunted over the landscape of his county. He pursued them on bicycle and on foot, watching through binoculars as they bathed, flew, stooped and roosted. He carried Ordnance Survey maps on which he marked in ballpoint pen the locations of his sightings, with circled capital letters – P, SH, HH, BO – recording raptors by species (M is for Merlin, K is for Kestrel). He learned to predict the peregrines’ locations by means of an intelligence that began as logic and ended as instinct, and in a relationship that began as fascination and ended as obsession.</p><p> 《百富勤》的故事非常引人注目，其内心深处是一个谜。从1954年到1964年大约十年间，一位来自埃塞克斯（Essex）的近视上班族追踪了猎鹰，猎鹰在他县的土地上搜寻。他骑着自行车和步行追赶他们，通过双筒望远镜观看它们沐浴，飞行，弯腰和栖息的情况。他随身携带了军械测量图，用圆珠笔标记了瞄准点的位置，并用圆圈大写字母P，SH，HH，BO记录了猛禽的种类（M代表Merlin，K代表红K）。他学会了通过一种以逻辑开始，以本能结束，以及以迷恋开始，以迷恋结束的关系来预测游击队的位置。</p><p>  Even the savage winter of 1962–63 – when the sea froze for two miles out from the shore, and spear-length icicles hung from eaves and trees – didn’t deter Baker from his quest. After a day in the field, he would retreat to the spare room of his Chelmsford terrace house, and write up the details in journals that together run to more than 1,600 manuscript pages.</p><p>  甚至在1962-63年这样残酷的冬天，当大海从岸边冻结了两英里，屋檐和树木上挂着长矛状的冰柱时，也丝毫没有阻止贝克的追求。在野外工作一天后，他将撤退到其切姆斯福德排屋的空余房间，并在日记本中写上详细内容，这些日记本共计1600余页。</p><p> In the mid-1960s, he compressed those journals into a book fewer than 60,000 words long, and written in ecstatic, violent, enraptored prose. The journals were coal to  The Peregrine’s diamond: crushed, they became the book. He collapsed 10 years into a single “season of hawk-hunting”, and “stripped” the narrative “down to the livid bone”, to borrow a phrase from one of his early poems. Instead of plot, he deployed pattern. The same actions recur across the book’s course: man pursues falcon, falcon pursues prey.</p><p> 在1960年代中期，他将这些期刊压缩成一本少于60,000字长的书，并用狂喜，暴力，沉迷的散文写成。日记本是百富勤钻石的煤炭：被压碎了，它们成了书。他崩溃了10年，陷入了一个单一的“狩猎鹰的季节”，并“剥去”了叙事“深沉的骨头”，借用了他一首早期诗歌中的一句话。他部署了模式，而不是情节。在这本书的整个过程中，同样的动作反复发生：男人追猎鹰，猎鹰追捕猎物。</p><p>  Repetitious in structure, the prose is nevertheless huge in drama – and much of this arises from the extraordinary energy Baker invests in his language. His style possesses what  Charles Olson – laying out his theory of “open field poetics” in 1950 – called “percussive” and “projectile” powers. Grammatically, his prose is dense in metaphors, similes, verbs and adverbs; accentually, it is thick with stressed syllables. This combination of axe-knock emphasis and high-impact syntax results in sentences that are stunning to read.</p><p>  散文在结构上是重复的，但是在戏剧中却是巨大的-这很大程度上归功于贝克在语言上的巨大投入。他的风格具有查尔斯·奥尔森（Charles Olson）的“打击乐”和“弹丸”力量。查尔斯·奥尔森（Charles Olson）在1950年提出了“开放领域诗学”理论。在语法上，他的散文密布着隐喻，明喻，动词和副词。口音很重，音节很重。轴敲强调和高影响力语法的这种结合导致句子令人赞叹。</p><p> The mystery: at some point during the writing of  The Peregrine, Baker went back to his journals and destroyed nearly all the passages in which he had recorded his field-sightings of the falcons. He left no account of why he had done so, and no version of the originals. By means of this redaction, he ensured that the most astonishing sequences of the published book flew free from any tether, and could not, as it were, be read back against the real.</p><p> 谜团：在写《百富勤》时，贝克回到他的日记中，几乎销毁了他记录猎鹰实地观察的所有段落。他没有说明为什么这样做，也没有留下任何原始版本。通过这种修改，他确保了已出版书中最令人惊讶的序列不受任何束缚的影响，并且无法像真实的那样被读回。 </p><p> Birdwatchers speak of the “jizz” of a bird to mean the sum of characteristics – shape, plumage, posture, call, habitat – that allow its instant identification from a general impression. A bird’s jizz is its gist and vibe: the aggregation of its particulars into a compound signature of life. Baker’s style has its own jizz. I think I could encounter a sentence of his prose anywhere and identify it immediately as his.</p><p>观鸟者将鸟类的“嗡嗡声”指的是各种特征的总和，包括形状，羽毛，姿势，召唤物，栖息地等，这些特征可以使它们从一般印象中立即识别出来。鸟类的精粹是其要旨和共鸣：将其详细信息汇总为生命的复合特征。贝克的风格各有特色。我想我可以在任何地方遇到他的散文句子，并立即将其识别为他的散文。</p><p> Adjectives and nouns wrenched into verbs; surreal similes; flaring adverbs: these are among the specifics that make up his unique gestalt. “Five thousand dunlin … rained away inland, like a horde of beetles gleamed with golden chitin.” “The north wind brittled icily in the pleached lattice of the hedges.” A yellow-billed cock blackbird is “like a small mad puritan with a banana in his mouth”. A woodpigeon dead on a winter field “glow[s] purple and grey like broccoli”.</p><p> 形容为动词的形容词和名词；超现实的明喻;夸张的副词：这些都是构成他独特的格式塔的细节。 “五千顿林……向内陆降雨，就像一群甲壳虫闪烁着金色甲壳质。” “北风在树篱的被打碎的格子中西西里岛脆。”黄嘴公鸡黑鸟“就像一个疯狂的清教徒，嘴里放着香蕉”。一只木鸽子死在冬天的田野上，“像西兰花一样发出紫色和灰色的光芒”。</p><p>  I’ve never taken LSD: thanks to Baker, I don’t need to. His Essex is landscape on acid: super-saturations of colour, wheeling phantasmagoria, dimensions blown out and falling away, nature as hypernature. Baker has inspired many imitators over the years, aiming to riff and rip to a comparable intensity of description. I’ve been one of them. But our style always feels brittle and synthetic in comparison with the original – mere Bakerlite.</p><p>  我从没学过LSD：感谢Baker，我不需要。他的艾塞克斯（Essex）风景如画：彩色的过饱和度，幻影般的幻觉，尺寸被吹散而消失，自然成为超自然。多年来，贝克启发了许多模仿者，旨在使即兴演奏和撕裂达到可比的描述强度。我曾经是其中之一。但是，与原始的纯Bakerlite相比，我们的风格总是感觉很脆和合成。</p><p> Early in  The Peregrine, he describes a dunlin being caught by a falcon that approaches it from behind at greater speed. “The dunlin,” he writes, “seemed to come slowly back to the hawk. It passed into his dark outline and did not reappear.” The image is space operatic: a small craft trapped in a larger craft’s tractor beam, and drawn relentlessly in. Baker’s book possesses a comparable traction. It locks on to its readers, and they pass involuntarily into it. By no means does everyone like it. I’ve heard it described as fascistic for its fetishisation of northerliness and predation. I know people who turn away from its misanthropy, which I think of as species shame. But no one doubts the book’s bleak bite.</p><p> 在《百富勤》的早期，他描述了一个都灵被一只猎鹰抓住，后者以更快的速度从后面接近。他写道，“邓林似乎慢慢地回到了鹰派。它进入了他的黑暗轮廓，并没有再出现。”该图像具有太空操纵性：一艘小艇被困在一艘大艇的牵引梁中，并被无情地吸引。贝克的书具有类似的牵引力。它锁定其读者，并且他们不由自主地传递给它。绝对不是每个人都喜欢它。我听说它因迷恋北方和捕食而被描述为法西斯主义。我知道人们拒绝了人类的不当行为，我认为这是物种耻辱。但是没有人怀疑这本书的惨淡表现。</p><p> Unlike much that passes for the culture of nature,  The Peregrine cannot be passively consumed. It sticks in the craw, it rakes the mind. The reprimand it offers – with its rituals of killing, and the spitting self-hatred of its narrator – to sentimental representations of a capitalised “Nature” is surely one reason for its contemporary grip. Under the sign of the Anthropocene, messy entanglement has replaced cool spectatorial distance. In an age of mass extinction it has become hard to tolerate notions of nature as an external or salvific “other”, except as forms of cute or kitsch.</p><p> 不同于自然文化的流传，百富勤不能被动消费。它粘在小龙虾中，使人烦恼。它提供的谴责-带有杀人的仪式，以及叙述者随地吐痰的自我憎恨-对大写的“自然”的感性表达无疑是其当代感的原因之一。在人类世的迹象下，混乱的纠缠取代了冷酷的视觉距离。在大规模灭绝的时代，除了作为可爱或媚俗的形式外，已经很难容忍自然概念作为外部或救赎的“其他”。</p><p> Baker’s sanguineous nature is very far from cute. It exists at the frayed edges of things, in a scruffy landscape of medieval woods and suburban sprawl, salt marshes and sea walls. Human experience is drastically decentred in favour of what the philosopher  John Gray (another of the book’s admirers) calls the “godless mysticism” of creaturely life.  The Peregrine is not “green” literature. It suggests no basis for the establishment of an environmental ethics born of commonality. “We are the killers. We stink of death,” writes Baker in the most self-lacerating passage. “We carry it with us. It sticks to us like frost. We cannot tear it away.” Yet its furious vision has given it an oddly hopeful power over many of its readers.</p><p> 贝克的天性远非可爱。它存在于磨损的边缘，中世纪森林茂密的景观和郊区的蔓延，盐沼和海堤中。人们的经验被极大地分散了，而被哲学家约翰·格雷（本书的另一位崇拜者）称为生物生活的“无神的神秘主义”。百富勤不是“绿色”文学。它没有提出建立具有共同性的环境伦理的基础。 “我们是杀手。我们为死亡感到难过，”贝克在最自嘲的文章中写道。 “我们随身携带。它像霜一样粘在我们身上。我们不能把它撕掉。”然而，它的愤怒眼光赋予了它许多读者以奇特的希望。</p><p> Over the years I have been told many stories of the effects of  The Peregrine on individuals. A former student cited it as the main influence in her decision to move to direct action as a means of environmental protest. A man wrote to say that he had grown up in working-class Walsall and at the age of nine had read  The Peregrine. “A whole new world opened up to me among the post-industrial gloom of the 1980s,” he said, “and directly as a result of the book I came to see the kingfishers that lived on the canal banks, and from there arose a lifelong fascination with the more-than-human world.” He went on to become a professional conservationist, bringing everyday nature into the lives of young people.</p><p> 多年来，我被告知许多关于百富勤对个人的影响的故事。一位前学生认为这是她决定采取直接行动作为环境抗议手段的主要影响力。一个男人写信说，他在工人阶级的沃尔索尔长大，九岁时就读过《百富勤》。他说：“在1980年代的后工业萧条中，一个全新的世界向我敞开了大门，”他说，“并且直接因为这本书，我看到了生活在运河岸边的翠鸟，从那里出现了一个终生痴迷于人类以外的世界。”他后来成为一名专业的环境保护主义者，将日常自然生活带入了年轻人的生活。 </p><p> Several years ago, I came to know a young musician living in a south London squat, and performing as frontman for a hardcore punk band. He was a talented, troubled person for whom “nature” as usually understood was irrelevant. But the dark fury of  The Peregrine spoke to him. He read it repeatedly, and lent his copy out often (though always claimed it back). He and I collaborated on a project one summer; there were plans to work together again. Then he died of a heroin overdose aged 23. He was buried in a winter field in Cornwall, with the cars of his friends pulled up near the grave, their stereos blasting out his music in tribute – and placed in the coffin with him was his copy of  The Peregrine.</p><p>几年前，我结识了一位年轻的音乐家，他住在伦敦南部的深蹲区，并担任硬派朋克乐队的主唱。他是一个有才华的，受困扰的人，对于他而言，通常所理解的“自然”是无关紧要的。但是，百富勤的黑暗愤怒对他说话。他反复阅读，并经常借出他的副本（尽管总是要求归还）。我和他在一个夏天合作完成了一个项目。有计划再次合作。然后他死于过量服用的海洛因，时年23岁。他被埋葬在康沃尔郡的一个冬天的田野里，他的朋友们的汽车停在坟墓附近，他们的立体声音响向他的音乐鼓吹致敬-并与他一起放在棺材中百富勤的副本。</p><p> No other book – save perhaps Nan Shepherd’s   The Living Mountain, which stands as  The Peregrine’s golden twin, offering light to its darkness, relation to its depletion – has been so influential on the recent British literature of landscape.  Roger Deakin,  Tim Dee,  Kathleen Jamie,  Richard Mabey,  Helen Macdonald,  James Rebanks and I are among the many to have acknowledged its force.  The Peregrine is increasing its territorial range, too. It was published last year in Germany, and editions are forthcoming in Chinese, Dutch, Spanish and Hebrew.</p><p> 除了南牧羊人的《活山》以外，没有其他书对最近的英国风景文学有如此大的影响。《活山》是百富勤的金色双胞胎，为黑暗提供了光明，并与枯竭有关。罗杰·迪肯（Roger Deakin），蒂姆·迪（Tim Dee），凯瑟琳·杰米（Kathleen Jamie），理查德·马贝（Richard Mabey），海伦·麦克唐纳（Helen Macdonald），詹姆斯·雷班克斯（James Rebanks）和我都是承认其力量的众多人。百富勤也在扩大其领土范围。该书于去年在德国出版，并将以中文，荷兰文，西班牙文和希伯来文发行。</p><p>  The book’s impact is not confined to literature. An opera company is presently considering an adaptation. A one-man theatrical interpretation is in development. A decade ago, the Australian composer  Lawrence English picked up a copy from a friend’s desk and opened it at random. He read a description of an owl silently hunting, and was gripped by the intensity of “listening” in the prose. “The book changed my life,” recalled English in 2015. To him it marked a “turning point in the 20th century” in its “recognition of the role humans play in shaping their environment”. In response English produced an album that surprised me when I first heard it for its sonic scarcity. Responding to  The Peregrine’s preoccupation with absence, English used frost-bitten drones and high strings to compose a burnt-out, irradiated soundtrack: a half-life soundscape of white ash.</p><p>  这本书的影响不仅限于文学。一家歌剧公司目前正在考虑改编。正在开发单人戏剧的解释。十年前，澳大利亚作曲家劳伦斯·英语（Lawrence English）从朋友的书桌上拿起了一份副本，并随意打开了。他读了一只猫头鹰在默默狩猎的描述，并被散文中“聆听”的强度所吸引。 “这本书改变了我的生活，”英语在2015年回忆说。对他来说，它标志着“对人类在塑造环境中所扮演角色的认可”的“ 20世纪转折点”。作为回应，English发行了一张专辑，当我第一次听到它的声音匮乏时，这让我感到惊讶。为了应对百富勤的缺席情况，英语使用了霜冻的无人机和高高的琴弦来构成燃尽的辐射声带：白灰的半衰期音景。</p><p> He sent a copy of  The Peregrine to the film director  Werner Herzog; Herzog read it and was astonished. He has since spoken often of the book, and it is now one of only three required texts for his Rogue Film School – along with Virgil’s  Georgics and Hemingway’s story  “The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber”. Herzog describes  The Peregrine as inducing “ecstasy” in the radical sense of the word: not just entranced or frenzied, but literally beside oneself. There are moments, he notes, “where you can tell that [Baker] has completely entered into the existence of a falcon. And this is what I do when I make a film: I step outside of myself into an  ekstasis; in Greek, to step outside of your own body.”</p><p> 他向电影导演沃纳·赫尔佐格（Werner Herzog）发送了《百富勤》的副本。赫尔佐格读了下来，感到惊讶。从那以后，他经常谈论这本书，而现在这本书是他的流氓电影学校仅有的三本必读课文之一，还有维吉尔（Georgics）的乔治（Georgics）和海明威（Hemingway）的故事“弗朗西斯·马康伯（Francis Macomber）的短暂幸福生活”。赫尔佐格（Herzog）将游击队形容为激进的“狂喜”一词：不仅是入迷或疯狂，而且实际上是在自己旁边。他指出，有些时刻，“您可以告诉[贝克]已经完全进入了猎鹰的行列。这就是我拍电影时要做的事情：我步入自我迷恋状态；用希腊语，走出自己的身体。”</p><p> The attraction of  The Peregrine to a film-maker is obvious: the pristinated vision, the sudden rapid pull shots (a stooping lens), the immense field of vision, the swivelling eye. The attraction to Herzog is clear, too, compelled as he has been in so many films by obsession, extremity and wildness (  Fitzcarraldo,   Grizzly Man,  The Ends of the Earth). The puzzle to me, for years, was why Herzog had not yet filmed  The Peregrine. In 2015, I wrote to ask if he was planning to do so. “If anyone can, it should be you,” I said. I sent him a photograph of my local peregrine perched on a church spire, part-gargoyle. Herzog replied within a few hours, generous about my own writing on Baker, but adamant about the book’s adaptability: “A feature film would be very wrong. There are texts that should never be touched. Georg Büchner’s   Lenz is one of these cases. In fact, whoever tries to make a feature film of  The Peregrine should be shot without trial.” Oh! Right. Message received and understood.</p><p> 《百富勤》对电影制片人的吸引力是显而易见的：注定的视野，突然的快速拉动镜头（弯腰的镜头），广阔的视野，旋转的眼睛。对赫尔佐格的吸引力也很明显，就像他在许多电影中一样，他痴迷，四肢和野性（菲茨卡拉拉多，灰熊人，天涯海角）都被他吸引了。多年来，令我困惑的是为什么赫尔佐格尚未拍摄《百富勤》。 2015年，我写信问他是否打算这样做。我说：“如果有人可以，那应该是你。”我给他寄了一张我的当地游牧民的照片，栖息在教堂的尖顶（部分石像鬼）上。赫尔佐格（Herzog）在几个小时后回答说，对我自己在贝克（Baker）上的写作很慷慨，但对这本书的适应性持坚定态度：“一部故事片是非常错误的。有些文本永远都不应被触及。 GeorgBüchner的Lenz就是其中一种。实际上，任何试图制作《百富勤》故事片的人都应在未经审判的情况下拍摄。”哦!对。消息已收到并理解。</p><p> Thirteen years ago I described  The Peregrine as “not a book about watching a bird, [but] a book about becoming a bird”. Baker himself often suggests a comparable process of conversion, writing of how – by means of primitive rituals of following and mimicking – “the hunter becom[es] the thing he hunts”. Now, though, I no longer believe  The Peregrine is a book about “becoming a bird”. Truer to say that it is a book about “failing to become a bird”.</p><p> 十三年前，我将百富勤描述为“不是一本关于观鸟的书，而是一本关于成鸟的书”。贝克本人经常提出一个类似的转换过程，写出如何-通过遵循和模仿的原始仪式-“猎人成为他所猎捕的东西”。但是，现在，我不再相信《百富勤》是一本关于“成为鸟”的书。说实话，这是一本关于“未成鸟”的书。</p><p> Unmistakably Baker longs for the deterritorialised experience of the falcons, wishing as they do to live in a “pouring-away world of no attachment”. And there are many moments of extreme interspecies identification, as when he finds himself “crouching over [a] kill, like a mantling hawk”. But these ecstatic moments are always followed by Baker’s wounding awareness of his anchorage in a crabbed human body. Again and again, subject-object distance is almost closed – only to yawn wide once more. Baker craves to “think like a falcon” (to adapt the title of  Thomas Nagel’s famous 1974 thought experiment) but also knows he cannot slip his form or quit his species.</p><p> 毫无疑问，贝克渴望猎鹰具有地域化的经历，并希望他们生活在一个“无依无靠的倾倒世界”中。在很多时候，极端种间的识别也很重要，例如当他发现自己“像杀了鹰的鹰一样蹲在[a]上杀死”时。但是，这些欣喜若狂的时刻总是伴随着贝克受伤的意识，使他意识到自己在蟹状人体中的固定。一次又一次，主体到物体的距离几乎是封闭的–只是再次打哈欠。贝克渴望“像猎鹰一样思考”（改编托马斯·内格尔（Thomas Nagel）1974年著名的思想实验的头衔），但他也知道他不能溜走自己的形态或放弃他的物种。 </p><p> Baker is, as English nicely puts it, a “ghost of a narrator”. He tells us almost nothing about himself. He scarcely eats or drinks, doesn’t sleep, never defecates, has no life beyond the fields and the sky, barely describes his clothing or his body. In mystical terms, he is an ascetic depleting himself in advance of disembodiment. In shamanic terms, he is a body preparing for sky burial. In terms of virtual reality, he is readying himself for upload into the cloud, and transformation into pure avatar. But however imagined, this activity of self-depletion can never quite be completed. Baker seeks a conversion from human to falcon, but the book’s desolation arises from the futility of his hope for this magical metamorphosis.</p><p>正如英语所说，贝克是“叙述者的鬼魂”。他几乎没有告诉我们关于他自己的任何事情。他几乎不吃不喝，不睡觉，不排便，在田野和天空之外没有生命，几乎没有描述他的衣服或身体。用神秘的术语来说，他是一个禁欲主义者，在被实施之前就耗尽了自己。用萨满言语来说，他是准备埋葬天空的尸体。在虚拟现实方面，他正准备将自己上传到云中，并转换为纯虚拟形象。但是无论如何想象，这种自耗活动永远都不可能完全完成。贝克寻求从人类到猎鹰的转变，但本书的荒凉源于他对这种神奇变态的希望徒劳无功。</p><p>   On 1 July 1940, when Baker was 15 years old, the secretary of state for air in Britain issued the “Destruction of Peregrine Falcons Order”. Adult and juvenile birds were to be shot, eyasses killed in the nests, eggs smashed and eyries disrupted. The order was made under wartime emergency defence regulations: peregrines were deemed too great a threat to the carrier pigeons that RAF bomber crews routinely took with them on flights. If a plane ditched at sea and a location could not be radioed through, the pigeons would be released with a leg tag to report their position. Falcons were dispensable, airmen were not – and so the falcons died. During the six years that the destruction order was in force, around 600 peregrines were shot, and unnumbered eyasses and eggs were destroyed. In certain counties – especially in southern England – peregrines were almost exterminated. By the time the order was lifted in 1946, the number of nesting pairs in England had been reduced to around half of its prewar level.</p><p>   1940年7月1日，贝克15岁那年，英国航空大臣发布了“销毁游eg猎鹰令”。将对成年和幼鸟进行射击，将燕窝杀死在巢中，将鸡蛋捣烂，并将eyry破坏。该命令是根据战时紧急防卫法规作出的：游击队被认为对英国皇家空军的轰炸机飞行员构成了巨大威胁，皇家空军的轰炸机人员经常在飞行中随身携带。如果一架飞机在海上被抛弃，并且无法通过无线电广播位置，那么鸽子将被释放，并带有一个腿标以报告其位置。猎鹰是可有可无的，而飞行员不是-因此猎鹰死了。在销毁令生效的六年中，大约有600个游击队遭到枪击，销毁了未编号的eyasse和蛋。在某些县，特别是在英格兰南部，百姓几乎被灭绝了。到1946年取消订单时，英格兰的筑巢对数量已减少到战前水平的一半左右。</p><p> The recovery of the English peregrine population from its wartime decline was incomplete when the next major human threat emerged. In 1956 – two years after Baker took up birdwatching – the first symptoms of the crisis became visible, as increasing numbers of peregrine pairs failed to hatch chicks. The toxins of organochlorine pesticides used in agriculture, most notably DDT, were concentrating as they moved up the food chain. Raptors suffered increased adult mortality, and a thinning of eggshells to the point of non-viability.</p><p> 当下一个主要的人类威胁出现时，英国百富勤人口从战时下降中的恢复还不完全。 1956年（贝克开始观鸟两年后），随着越来越多的游eg对未能孵化雏鸡，危机的最初症状变得显而易见。农业中使用的有机氯农药的毒素，尤其是滴滴涕，随着它们在食物链中的移动而集中。猛禽的成年死亡率增加，蛋壳变薄到无法生存的地步。</p><p> Unlike much that passes for the culture of nature, The Peregrine cannot be passively consumed. It sticks in the craw</p><p> 与自然文化的传承不同，百富勤不能被被动消费。它粘在乌鸦里</p><p> The result was, in the words of raptor-specialist Derek Ratcliffe, “a spectacular crash of population with a speed and on a scale seldom found in the vertebrate kingdom”. By 1963, only three territories were reported as occupied by peregrines in southern England, and Scottish and Welsh populations were also in freefall. “Few winter in England now, fewer nest here,” writes Baker early in his book. “The ancient eyries are dying.” He was well aware of the connection between pesticide use and peregrine death: hence his hissing fury in the book at what he calls the “filthy, insidious pollen of farm chemicals”. “If further decline had continued unchecked,” noted Ratcliffe later, “extinction of the peregrine in Britain could have occurred around 1967” – the year  The Peregrine was published.</p><p> 用猛禽专家德里克·拉特克利夫（Derek Ratcliffe）的话说，结果是“脊椎动物王国中很少见的，以速度和规模大规模发生的惊人人口崩溃”。到1963年，据报道英格兰南部的游击队仅占领了三个领土，苏格兰和威尔士人口也自由下落。贝克早期在书中写道：“现在英格兰的冬天很少，这里的巢穴更少。” “远古时代正在消亡。”他非常清楚农药使用与百富勤死亡之间的联系：因此，他在书中怒吼他称之为“肮脏，阴险的农药的花粉”。拉特克利夫（Ratcliffe）后来指出：“如果进一步的下降没有受到抑制，”英国的百富勤灭绝可能发生在1967年左右。</p><p> As the falcons were dying, so the Essex landscape was also undergoing its most drastic transformation since enclosure. Urban growth caused green belts to bulge and break, and the postwar drive for big-field farming and agricultural self-sustainability resulted in the destruction of thousands of miles of hedgerows. We know from Baker’s letters and poems that his affection for the Essex countryside, especially inland Essex between Great Baddow and West Hanningfield, was profound – and his pain at its disruption correspondingly acute.</p><p> 随着猎鹰的垂死，埃塞克斯的风景也经历了自封闭以来最剧烈的变化。城市的发展导致绿化带凸起和断裂，战后对大田农业和农业自我可持续性的推动导致数千英里的树篱遭到破坏。从贝克的书信中我们知道，他对埃塞克斯乡村，特别是Great Baddow和西汉宁菲尔德之间的内陆埃塞克斯的感情深远-他为破坏埃塞克斯而遭受的痛苦也相应地强烈。</p><p> An even greater threat hangs over  The Peregrine, though, than the extinction of a single species in a single country or the devastation of a loved landscape. In the famous prologue of  Rachel Carson’s  Silent Spring, an imaginary American town is poisoned by a “white … powder” that drops from the air “like snow upon the roofs and the lawns, the fields and the streams”. This is the powder of agrichemicals – but of course it is also the dust of radioactive fallout.</p><p> 然而，比起单一国家中单个物种的灭绝或所爱之地的毁灭，游击队面临的威胁更大。在著名的雷切尔·卡森（Rachel Carson）的《寂静的春天》（Silent Spring）的序幕中，一个虚构的美国小镇被“白色……粉末”毒死，“白色……粉末”从空中落下，“就像屋顶和草坪，田野和溪流上的积雪”。这是农药的粉末，但当然也是放射性尘埃的尘埃。 </p><p> It is hard to read  Silent Spring outside its cold war context, and I also take Baker’s book to be nuclear as much as it is pesticidal. Baker was researching his book through the first decade of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing, and began writing it shortly after the  Cuban missile crisis. In 1957 construction work started on the massive nuclear power station at Bradwell-on-Sea, right in the heart of Baker’s hunting territory. Generation was commenced in 1962. His prose is riven with nuclear anxieties: this is a book in which death falls from the air, and in which the landscape is figured frequently as “burning” and “dying” on a planetary scale.</p><p>在冷战的背景之外很难读懂《寂静的春天》，而且我也认为贝克的书具有杀虫剂的作用。贝克一直在研究原子弹和氢弹测试的第一个十年，并在古巴导弹危机之后不久开始撰写这本书。 1957年，就在贝克狩猎区中心的海上布拉德威尔上的大型核电站开始了建设工作。世代始于1962年。他的散文充满了对核的忧虑：这本书中，死亡从空中坠落，其中的景观经常被视为在行星尺度上“燃烧”和“死亡”。</p><p>   Fifteen years ago, relatively little was known about Baker. This was partly due to the writer’s strategic development of his own mystery. In the winter of 1967, he was given an Arts Council award of £1,200. The Daily Telegraph reported on the award: “The most unusual of the [recipients] is John Baker, who lives in a council house in Essex and does not want to say which town in case the neighbours discover what he does. He has no telephone and never leaves his home.”</p><p>   十五年前，对贝克的了解还很少。部分原因是作者对自己的神秘事物进行了战略发展。 1967年冬天，他获得了艺术理事会的1200英镑奖金。 《每日电讯报》报道了这一奖项：“最不寻常的是约翰·贝克，他住在埃塞克斯郡的一所议会大厦内，不想说出哪个城镇，以防邻居们发现他的所作所为。他没有电话，从不离开家。”</p><p> As the cult of Baker has spread and strengthened, much more has been discovered in terms of biography. Thanks to the efforts of David Cobham, James Canton,  Mark Cocker and especially John Fanshawe – who painstakingly gathered and secured Baker’s archive, including journals, letters, book drafts and a list of the titles in his library – our picture has now filled out. This autumn, Little Toller books will publish the first biography – the beautifully titled  My House of Sky by Hetty Saunders.</p><p> 随着贝克邪教的传播和加强，在传记方面发现了更多东西。得益于大卫·科汉姆（David Cobham），詹姆斯·坎顿（James Canton），马克·科克（Mark Cocker）以及尤其是约翰·范肖（John Fanshawe）的努力，他们辛苦地收集并保存了贝克的档案，包括日记，信件，书稿和他图书馆中的书名清单，我们的照片现在已经填满。今年秋天，Little Toller的书籍将出版第一本传记-Hetty Saunders题为《我的天空之屋》的精美文章。</p><p> The two details that perhaps bear most forcefully on  The Peregrine are Baker’s extreme short-sightedness, and the agonising inflammatory arthritis that afflicted him for most of his life. By the 1960s his illness was so severe that it was first stiffening and then fusing the joints in his spine, fingers and legs. Suffering as he did from curtailed vision and a stiffened body, the peregrine stood as both his dream totem and his prosthesis – perfected in precisely the ways that Baker was lessened. A peregrine’s eyeballs magnify vision by around 30% in comparison to human sight, allowing it to spy prey from sky high, and then fall on it at up to 270mph, the fastest speed of any creature on earth.</p><p> 也许，《百富勤》最有力的两个细节是贝克的极端近视和困扰他一生的痛苦性炎性关节炎。到1960年代，他的病已如此严重，以至于先变得僵硬，然后将脊柱，手指和腿部的关节融合在一起。由于他的视力下降和身体僵硬，他的游击队既是他梦to以求的图腾，也是他的假肢-正是通过减轻贝克的方式使其完美。与人类的视野相比，一个游洞的眼球将视野扩大了约30％，使它可以从高空窥视猎物，然后以时速270 mph的速度跌倒，这是地球上任何生物的最快速度。</p><p> What Baker could not see unaided, he saw with the aid of technology: his Miranda 10 x 50 binoculars and his featherweight JH Steward spotter scope, which he carried with him in the field. “Binoculars and a hawk-like vigilance,” he wrote, “reduce the disadvantage of myopic human vision.”  The Peregrine is therefore a product of what Tim Dee has nicely called “the magnified century”. Faces, in  The Peregrine, usually have something held up to them: some object or prosthesis interposing between eye and world. Imagery recurs of visors, masks, helmets and lenses.</p><p> 贝克借助技术帮助看到了肉眼看不见的东西：他随身携带的Miranda 10 x 50双筒望远镜和轻巧的JH Steward瞄准镜。他写道：“双筒望远镜和鹰般的警惕，减轻了近视人类视力的弊端。”因此，百富勤是蒂姆·迪伊（Tim Dee）所说的“放大的世纪”的产物。在《百富勤》中，人脸通常举起某些东西：介于眼睛和世界之间的某些物体或假体。遮阳板，口罩，头盔和镜头的图像重复出现。</p><p> I have come to think of Baker’s style, in fact, as a kind of augmented-reality visor – an Oculus Rift of text that enables otherwise impossible precisions of seeing and movement. This is one reason why reading Ba</p><p> 实际上，我已经将贝克的风格视为一种增强现实的面罩-一种Oculus Rift文字，可以实现其他方式无法实现的精确视线和运动。这是读爸的原因之一</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/the-peregrine-by-ja-baker-nature-writing">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/15/the-peregrine-by-ja-baker-nature-writing</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/春天/">#春天</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/spring/">#spring</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/贝克/">#贝克</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
