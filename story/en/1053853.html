When  Emperor Augustus dined with him on one memorable occasion, a servant broke a crystal goblet, and an enraged Vidius order the servant thrown to the eels. Augustus was shocked, and ordered all the crystal at the table to be broken. Vidius was forced to pardon the servant, since he could hardly punish him for breaking one goblet when Augustus had broken so many more.</p><p>曾经是一个名叫Vedius Pollio的富裕罗马人，臭名昭着的是维持一个人吃鳗鱼的水库，他会扔掉那些不满他的奴隶，导致他们的艰难死亡。当皇帝奥古斯都在一个令人难忘的场合与他一起吃饭时，仆人打破了一个水晶高脚杯，驾驶到鳗鱼的愤怒vidius命令。奥古斯都震惊，并在桌子上命令所有水晶被打破。 Vidius被迫赦免仆人，因为当Augustus打破了这么多时，他几乎无法惩罚他打破一只高脚杯。</p><p> That servant seems to have been spared, but many others had their &#34;bowels torn asunder&#34; by the eels. And that&#39;s just one of the many horrific ways the ancient Romans devised to kill those who displeased or or offended them, from crucifixions and feeding people to wild beasts, to setting slaves on fire, and  assassinating Julius Caesar on the Ides of March.  Historian Emma Southon covers them all in her wittily irreverent new book,  A Fatal Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum: Murder in Ancient Rome, showing us how the people of ancient Rome viewed life, death, and what it means to be human.</p><p> 那个仆人似乎已经幸免了，但许多其他人有他们的＆＃34;肠子被摧毁了＆＃34;鳗鱼。而且它只是古代罗马人设计的古代罗马人杀死那些不满或冒犯他们的人的方式之一，从钉十字架和喂养人们到野兽，让奴隶着火，并暗杀朱利叶斯凯撒对ides行进。历史学家艾玛·汉宁在她诙谐的新书中覆盖了他们所有的致命事件，在前往论坛的途中发生了致命的事情：在古罗马的谋杀案，向我们展示了古罗马人民如何观赏生命，死亡以及它意味着人类的意味着什么。</p><p> Inspiration struck in April 2018, when the notorious Golden State Killer,  Joseph James DeAngelo, was arrested—a big day for true crime aficionados like Southon. While chatting with a fellow true crime buff and history teacher, Southon learned that her friend often used true crime as a teaching tool for specific cultural biases—for instance, using the example of  Jeffrey Dahmer as a context for discussing homophobia in the 1990s. Intrigued, Southon searched for a true crime book about killings in ancient Rome, only to realize that nobody had written such a book. So she set out to rectify that grievous oversight, and the result is a delightful blend of true crime and ancient history.</p><p> Inspiration于2018年4月袭击，当时臭名昭着的金色州杀手Joseph James Deangelo被捕 - 真正犯罪的一个大日子，如Southon。绍宁聊天时聊天，同时探讨了她的朋友经常使用真正的犯罪作为特定文化偏见的教学工具 - 例如，使用Jeffrey Dahmer的示例作为讨论20世纪90年代的同性恋恐惧症的背景。兴趣的，绍斯搜查了一个真正的犯罪书关于古罗马的杀戮，只是意识到没有人写这样的书。因此，她旨在纠正这种严重的监督，结果是真正犯罪和古代历史的令人愉快的融合。</p><p> Southon was struck by the elaborate nature of of the public executions in particular. &#34;Just having someone being eaten by a leopard wasn&#39;t fun enough [for the Romans],&#34; she told Ars.  &#34;They had to fins ways to build narrative tension: when is it going to happen? Where is the lion going to come from?&#34; Crucifixions occurred in the most public spaces, and the Romans presumably were inured to the sight of rotting bodies falling apart on a cross as they went about their daily activities. &#34;Just like true crime, it&#39;s the horror that makes it fascinating,&#34; Southon said. &#34;You just want to poke at the dark soul behind it, and see what makes that tick.&#34;</p><p> 特别是南部被阐述的特征性令人震惊。 ＆＃34;只是有一个被豹子被吃掉的人＆＃39;对于罗马人，＆＃34;她告诉ars。 ＆＃34;他们不得不鳍来建立叙事紧张局势：什么时候会发生？狮子来自哪里？＆＃34;钉十字架发生在最顽固的空间，罗马人可能会因为他们对日常活动而在交叉的旋转机构上脱落。 ＆＃34;就像真正的罪行一样，它＆＃39;恐怖，让它迷人，＆＃34;绍斯说。 ＆＃34;你只是想在它背后的黑暗灵魂中戳，看看是什么让那个蜱。＆＃34;</p><p>  Ars Technica: You spend a lot of time at first talking about the definition of murder. How did you determine what constituted murder in ancient Rome for inclusion in your book?</p><p>  ARS Technica：你在第一次谈论谋杀的定义时花了很多时间。你是如何确定古罗马谋杀案的谋杀是如何包含在你的书中的？</p><p> Emma Southon: Murder is very culturally specific. It&#39;s not that easily defined. Homicide is easily defined and has a clear definition: when one person kills another person. Murder is a word for something that is a crime, and that is different from homicide.  English law is very specific.  American law, because it&#39;s so many different states, it&#39;s wild. There&#39;s so many different ways in which murder is defined: you have first degree murder and second degree murder, and then manslaughter, and then first degree manslaughter and second degree manslaughter. It&#39;s so broad, and yet so specific at the same time, but if you move 10 miles in any direction, it&#39;s a completely different thing.  So I could just say, &#34;I&#39;m just counting all homicide as coming under the umbrella of the book,&#34; even though the Romans would never consider any of this murder. It&#39;s an emotive topic, and law is often much more emotive than people think it is.</p><p> Emma Southon：谋杀是非常有文化的。它不是那么容易定义的。凶杀案很容易定义，并且有一个明确的定义：当一个人杀死另一个人时。谋杀是一种犯罪的东西，与凶杀案不同。英国法律非常具体。美国法律，因为它＆＃39; s这么多不同的州，它＆＃39; s wild。其中许多不同的方式定义了许多不同的方式：你有一级谋杀案和二等程度谋杀，然后过失过失杀人，然后是第一学位过失杀人和二级过失杀人。它和＃39;如此宽泛，但却同时具体，但如果你在任何方向移动10英里，它是一个完全不同的东西。所以我可以说，＆＃34;我只是在书的伞下计算所有凶杀案，＆＃34;尽管罗马人永远不会考虑任何谋杀案。它＆＃39;是一种情绪化的话题，法律往往比人们认为是更感兴趣的。</p><p>  Emma Southon: They did, but it was very specific about the methods used: poisoning, or carrying a knife. But if you threw somebody off a cliff, that doesn&#39;t fall under that law. Much later on you get things like Constantine&#39;s law, the first one that outlaws killing enslaved people. He lists, for about a page, all of the ways in which you&#39;re no longer allowed to deliberately kill an enslaved person. &#34;Don&#39;t set them on fire. Don&#39;t throw them off of something. Don&#39;t hit them with a rock. “ Why do you need to be this specific? It&#39;s because Roman laws are so often not aiming at generic things. They are responding to something specific. Especially when you get to the Imperial period, they are generally propagated in order to respond to a specific problem, rather than trying to make a law that is applicable to lots of things.</p><p>  Emma Southon：他们所做的，但它非常具体地对所用方法：中毒或携带刀。但如果你从悬崖上扔了一些人，那就不会陷入这种法律下。稍后让你得到像君士坦丁的事情，第一个禁止杀死奴役的人。他列出了关于页面的所有方式，您都没有再允许故意杀死被奴役的人。 ＆＃34; Don＆＃39; t让他们着火了。不要把它们甩掉一些东西。不要用岩石击中它们。 “为什么你需要这样做？它＆＃39; s是因为罗马法律往往没有针对普通的事情。他们正在响应具体的东西。特别是当你到达皇宫时，它们通常被传播，以便回应特定问题，而不是试图制定适用于许多事情的法律。 </p><p>    But they&#39;re pretty clear it has to be intentional. Like, &#34;You said I couldn&#39;t set him on fire, but you didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t strangle him.&#34; Or, &#34;You didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t crucify him in my back garden,&#34; or, &#34;You didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t feed him to a lamprey.&#34;</p><p>但他们＆＃39;重新清楚它必须是故意的。喜欢，＆＃34;你说我不能让他着火，但你没有说我不能扼杀他。＆＃34;或者，＆＃34;你没有说我可以在我的后花园里钉在十字架上，＆＃39;或者，＆＃34;你没有说我不能喂他去柳条。＆＃34;</p><p> Ars Technica: You have a PhD in ancient history  and you&#39;re a serious scholar, but one of the most delightful things about your book is how you imbue these tales with humor—a rare thing for history books.</p><p> ARS Technica：你在古代历史和你的博士学位和你＆＃39;重新获得一个严肃的学者，而是关于你的书的最令人愉快的事情之一是你如何用幽默 - 历史书籍的罕见事情。</p><p> Emma Southon: I don&#39;t read that many popular history books, because I find them quite boring. I will usually skim them to see what the interesting bits are, rather than sit down and read them. I just write books that I want to read. I write what I would say to you if I were in the pub with you. If I were going to tell you the story of the lampreys, then that&#39;s pretty much how I would describe it. What I want is for people to pick up the book and keep reading it, and say, &#34;Wow, the Romans are pretty interesting and there’s a lot more to them than just three emperors and some white togas.&#34;</p><p> Emma Southon：我读到了许多流行的历史书籍，因为我发现它们非常无聊。我通常会浏览他们，看看有趣的比特是什么，而不是坐下来读它们。我只是写下我想读书的书。如果我和你在酒吧里，我会写下我会对你说的话。如果我打算告诉你Lampreys的故事，那么这几乎是我如何形容它。我想要的是人们拿起书籍并继续阅读它，并说，＆＃34;哇，罗马人非常有趣，而不是三个皇帝和一些白色的Togas。＆＃34;</p><p>   Emma Southon: It&#39;s true.  Everything&#39;s hampered by curricula, is the problem. Curricula are never, like, &#34;You know what you should do? You should show them a  tintinnabulum [a decorative bell mounted on a pole] and then get people to talk about the tintinnabulum and about why somebody might put a penis-headed lion with a penis for a tail [on it].</p><p>   Emma Southon：它＆＃39;真实。一切＆＃39;课程受到阻碍，是问题。课程永远不会像，＆＃34;你知道你应该怎么做？你应该向他们展示一个Tintinnabulum [安装在杆上的装饰铃声]然后让人们谈论Tintinnabulum，以及为什么有人可能会把阴茎头狮子与阴茎放在尾巴[上]。</p><p> This is why I ended up doing ancient history. I did modern history at school, until I was 16. It&#39;s all battles and treaties and Hitler, and then some more treaties and battles. It just was so tedious. Ancient history sounded more fun. I got a copy of  Suetonius and read it and thought, &#34;These guys are great.&#34; It&#39;s all just gossip and people having rude pictures and ghosts and omens. And then I read  Aristophanes, a Greek comedy playwright; it&#39;s just dick jokes all the way down. I thought, &#34;Clearly, this was where I was always meant to be.&#34;</p><p> 这就是为什么我最终做了古代的历史。我在学校做了现代历史，直到我16岁。它的所有战斗和条约和希特勒，然后更多的条约和战斗。它只是如此乏味。古代历史听起来更有趣。我得到了一份Suetonius的副本，并阅读了它并思考，＆＃34;这些家伙很棒。＆＃34;它＆＃39;所有只是八卦和有粗鲁的图片和鬼魂和鬼魂的人。然后我读了射击，是一个希腊喜剧剧作家;它＆＃39;只是鸡巴一路下来。我想，＆＃34;显然，这是我总是意味着的地方。＆＃34;</p><p> The history of ancient Rome is not this boring world of  Cicero shouting or Julius Caesar marching around. It is this world of where they would get really upset if they stubbed their toe while they were going to an important meeting, so they&#39;d have to go home and end the whole day because that meant the gods didn&#39;t want them to do it. Or where they were nude all the time in the bars and had all seen each other&#39;s penises. They&#39;re such a weird and contradictory set of people. I love them more every year.</p><p> 古罗马的历史并不是西塞罗大喊大叫或朱利叶斯凯撒游行的无聊世界。这是这个世界，如果他们在他们要参加一个重要的会议的时候，他们会真的很难生气勃勃的地方，所以他们＆＃39; D必须回家，因为这意味着众神并没有＆＃39; t希望他们这样做。或者他们在酒吧里的所有时间都裸体，并且都互相看见＆＃39;阴茎。他们＆＃39;重新获得这种奇怪和矛盾的人。我每年都爱他们。</p><p> Ars Technica: It&#39;s so difficult to tease out what really happened so long ago because of the scarcity of information, and the fact that the historical sources that have survived sometimes contradict one another. How do you approach this problem?</p><p> ARS Technica：它＆＃39非常难以挑剔真正发生的事情，因为信息稀缺，这一事实幸存下来的历史来源有时彼此矛盾。你如何接近这个问题？ </p><p> Emma Southon: The sources are always kind of dicey for the Romans. It&#39;s so rare that you get to know what actually happened, because if you&#39;ve got two versions of a source, then you&#39;ve got two different versions of a story, even if they&#39;re written by two people sitting next to one another. Romans didn&#39;t write history like we want to write history. They didn&#39;t write what really happened. They wrote history as literature, and what they were writing was closer to  Robert Graves than it was to what we would consider to be academic history.</p><p>Emma Southon：这些消息来源总是为罗马人划分。它＆＃39是如此罕见的是你了解实际发生了什么，因为如果你有两个版本的来源，那么你有两个不同的版本的故事，即使他们＆＃39;重新写在彼此相邻的两个人。罗马人并没有写作历史记录，就像我们想要写历史记录一样。他们没有写下真正发生的事情。他们将历史写为文学，他们写的是越来越靠近罗伯特坟墓，而不是我们认为是学术史的东西。</p><p> Once you acknowledge that, then you can see what story they&#39;re trying to tell. What are they responding to? What&#39;s the context in which this was written? What are they trying to do? Who is their reader? Who is their audience?&#34; That&#39;s how you have to approach Roman source. If you&#39;ve got some set of events that appear in each one, then you can be fairly sure that they&#39;re all working from the same song book, but they are all writing their own narrative about it. Acknowledge that, and you can let go of the idea of trying to find out what really happened, and you can also accept common myths as the stories that people wanted to tell about the Romans.</p><p> 一旦你承认，那么你可以看到他们＆＃39的故事。重新试图告诉。他们在回应什么？什么＆＃39;这是写的上下文？他们想要做什么？谁是他们的读者？谁是他们的观众？＆＃34;那个＆＃39;你如何接近罗马来源。如果你有一组出现在每一个的一些事件，那么你就可以确定他们＆＃39;重新从同一个歌书上工作，但他们都在写自己的叙述。承认，你可以放弃试图找出真正发生的事情的想法，你也可以接受普通神话作为人们想讲述罗马人的故事。</p><p>    People want Julius Caesar to be this great general who was an amazing person. They want that version of Julius Caesar because it tells the story of Romans who are the foundation of &#34;the West,&#34; which American civilization and British civilization have built themselves to emulate. Caesar had an oratorial ability and a charm about him. He could show up and people would swoon, and people chased him down the street because they loved him so much. But he was also a deranged, corrupt, upstart who didn&#39;t care about anyone or anything except himself, who committed genocide in Gaul, killed a million people in the cruelest of circumstances and then boasted about it, and who then came back, didn&#39;t give up his position and instead marched on Rome. He just kept granting himself honors. Nobody could reason with him or talk to him.</p><p>    人们希望朱利叶斯凯撒成为这位伟大的一般人，他是一个令人惊叹的人。他们想要那个朱利叶斯凯撒的版本，因为它讲述了罗马人的故事，他们是＆＃34的基础;西方，＆＃34;美国文明和英国文明建立了自己的仿效。凯撒有一个讲述的能力和关于他的魅力。他可以出现，人们会昏昏欲睡，人们将他追逐在街上，因为他们非常爱他。但他也是一个疯狂的，腐败，追踪，谁没有关心他人，除了在国防委员会犯下种族灭绝的人之外的任何人或任何东西，在最残酷的情况下杀死了一百万人，然后吹嘘它，然后谁回来了，没有放弃他的立场，而是在罗马游行。他只是赐予自己荣誉。没有人可以和他合理或跟他说话。</p><p>    Ars Technica: That’s a good way to put it. What can we learn from Roman murder that is applicable to us today?</p><p>    ARS Technica：这是一个好方法。我们可以从今天适用于我们的罗马谋杀案中学习什么？</p><p> Emma Southon: If you&#39;re on Twitter, you get people coming at you all the time with Cicero in their bio who want to tell you about western civilization and how great it was. They love the version of Rome that we are so often shown in popular media, and that is embedded so strongly even in our architecture. Looking at the world through Roman murder, and how they treated people they thought were important or not important, you see that this is either what [the Cicero fans on Twitter] want, or they don&#39;t realize what they are advocating for: a world entirely propped up by slavery, in which it is very explicit that some people count and some people don&#39;t count. The thing that makes you count is your family background and your wealth, and that&#39;s about it.</p><p> Emma Southon：如果你在Twitter上，你会让人们在他们的生物中一直陪你，他们想要告诉你西方文明以及它有多伟大。他们喜欢我们经常在流行媒体中显示的罗马版本，即使在我们的建筑中也是如此强烈嵌入的。通过罗马谋杀案，以及他们对他们认为的人来说是重要的或不重要的，你认为这是一个[Twitter上的西官粉丝]想要的，或者他们没有意识到他们所倡导的东西：一个完全由奴隶制提出的世界，其中一些人数目很明确，有些人数和一些人不计数。让你算是你的家庭背景和你的财富的东西，那就是＆＃39;关于它。</p><p>  You either have to expose this stuff and force people who say they want [this type of] western civilization and be explicit about it, or you have to make them confront that, and hopefully they&#39;ll back down.  One of the things I wanted to do is to show that, it was pretty grim, guys. It makes you feel a bit better about now. We&#39;ve never had anybody, to my knowledge,  raped to death by a bull [or  a giraffe, in the legend of Locusta] in public for fun.</p><p>  你要么要公开这种东西，要么强迫那些说他们想要[这种类型]的西方文明并明确到它的人，或者你必须让他们面对，并且希望他们＆＃39; ll回来。我想做的一件事就是表明，这是非常严峻的人。它让你觉得现在更好。我们从来没有任何人，我的知识，由公共汽车在公共场合被公牛[或一只长颈鹿在洛马塔的传说中强奸了。</p><p> Ars Technica: You include an epigram right at the beginning of the book about how right and wrong are geometrical. What about that resonates with you?</p><p> ARS Technica：您在本书开始时包含了epigram关于如何正确和错误是几何。那个和你共鸣怎么样？ </p><p> Emma Southon: That is from Donald Black&#39;s   Pure Sociology and it really stuck with me. There&#39;s another book that I was reading, called   Is Killing Wrong? which is a very fun book to read in public. It outlines the thing that the Romans made reality, that in the modern world is less explicit: the notion that rightness and wrongness have levels. If all you had left were our laws, you would be able to write, as a historian 2,000 years from now, &#34;Murder was illegal and anyone who committed murder against anyone was arrested and these were the penalties that were handed out for them,&#34; because most of them are pretty clear.</p><p>Emma Southon：那是来自唐纳德黑＆＃39;纯粹的社会学，它真的坚持下去。我正在阅读的另一本书，叫做错了吗？这是一个非常有趣的书在公共上阅读。它概述了罗马人现实的事情，在现代世界的情况下不太明确：正确和错误的概念有水平。如果你所留下的只是我们的法律，你将能够写作，作为历史学家从现在开始，谋杀案是非法的，谋杀犯罪的人被捕，这些都被捕，这些都被捕了他们，＆＃34;因为大多数人都很清楚。</p><p> You would think that that was presumably universal, but when you look at the reality of the situation, you&#39;ll find that if a black man kills a white woman, that&#39;s more wrong than if a white man kills a black man, because the black man will likely get a death sentence and the white man won&#39;t. A homeless person killing a CEO is going to get a much harsher penalty than a CEO killing a homeless person. There are levels to what our system actually considers to be right and wrong. I found that really useful as a lens as I was combing through [archives], looking for all the [Roman] murders I could find. That&#39;s the geometric nature of the way that we see right and wrong in terms of murder.</p><p> 你会认为这是普遍的，但是当你看看情况的现实时，你会发现如果一个黑人杀死一名白人，那就比如果一个白人杀死一个白人的错误黑人，因为黑人可能会得到一个死刑句子和白人赢得了＆＃39; t。一名无家可归的人杀死首席执行官将比杀死无家可归者的首席执行官带来一个骚扰罚球。我们的系统实际认为是正确的级别的水平。我发现当我通过[档案]梳理时，真的很有用镜头，寻找我能找到的所有[罗马]谋杀案。那种＆＃39;我们在谋杀方面看到对方式和错误的几何性质。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/stabbing-crucifixion-eaten-by-eels-learn-all-about-murder-the-roman-way/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/stabbing-crucifixion-eaten-by-eels-learn-all-about-murder-the-roman-way/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/方式/">#方式</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
