There have been no casualties. We all count ourselves fortunate to have found safe haven at a moment when the expedition was clearly set on disaster.</p><p>祝你好运，我们已经能够在这个无人居住的空间站进行紧急降落。没有伤亡。我们都算是幸运的是，当探险明确落在灾难时，才能找到避风港。</p><p> The station carries no identification markings and is to small to appear on our charts. Although of elderly construction it is soundly designed and in good working order, and seems to have been used in recent times as a transit depot for travelers resting at mid-point in their journeys. Its interior consists of a series of open passenger concourses., with comfortably equipped lounges and waiting rooms. As yet we have not been able to locate the bridge or control centre. We assume that the station was one of many satellite drogues surrounding a large command unit, and was abandoned when a decline in traffic left it surplus to the needs of the parent transit system.</p><p> 该站没有识别标记，并且很小就出现在我们的图表上。虽然老年建筑良好设计，良好的工作秩序，似乎是近代作为旅行者在旅程中休息的旅行者的过境仓库。它的内部包括一系列开放式乘客。，配有舒适的休息室和候诊室。尚于我们无法找到桥梁或控制中心。我们假设该车站是围绕一个大型命令单位的卫星滴漏之一，并且当交通的下降剩余剩余时被遗弃到母程系统的需求。</p><p> A curious feature of the station is its powerful gravitational field, far stronger than would be suggested by its small mass. However, this probably represents a faulty reading by our instruments. We hope shortly to complete our repairs and are grateful to have found shelter in this relic of the now forgotten migrations of the past.</p><p> 该车站的一个好奇的特征是其强大的引力场，远远强大，而不是其小质量的建议。然而，这可能代表了我们的仪器的错误阅读。我们希望尽快完成我们的维修，并感谢在此遗址过去的遗传迁徙中找到了庇护所。</p><p>   Our repairs are taking longer than we first estimated. Certain pieces of equipment will have to be reconstructed from scratch, and to shorten this task we are carrying out a search of our temporary home. To our surprise we find that the station is far larger than we guessed. A thin local atmosphere surrounds the station, composed of interstellar dust attracted by its unusually high gravity. This fine vapour obscured the substantial bulk of the station and led us to assume that it was no more than a few hundred metres in diameter.</p><p>   我们的维修比我们第一次估计更长时间。某些设备必须从头开始重建，并缩短这项任务，我们正在寻找我们的临时家庭。我们惊讶的是，我们发现车站远远大于我们猜到的。薄薄的局部气氛围绕到车站，由其异常高的重力吸引的星际灰尘组成。这种精美的蒸气掩盖了车站的大量大部分，并导致我们假设直径不超过几百米。</p><p> We began by setting out across the central passenger concourse that separates the two hemispheres of the station. This wide deck is furnished with thousands of tables and chairs. But on reaching the high partition doors 200 metres away we discovered that the restaurant deck is only a modest annex to a far larger concourse. An immense roof three storeys high extends across an open expanse of lounges and promenades. We explored several of the imposing staircases, each equipped with a substantial mezzanine, and found that they lead to identical concourses above and below.</p><p> 我们开始在中央客栈中突出，将车站的两个半球分开。宽敞的甲板配有成千上万的桌椅。但是，在达到200米外的高级分区门，我们发现餐厅甲板只是一个更大的大厅的谦虚附件。一个巨大的屋顶三层高度延伸穿越开放的休息室和长廊。我们探索了几个浮雕的楼梯，每个夹层都配备了大量的夹层，发现它们导致上下和下方的相同奇类。</p><p> The space station has clearly been used as a vast transit facility, comfortably accomodating many thousands of passengers. There are no crew quarters or crowd control posts. The absence of even a single cabin indicates that this army of passengers spent only a brief time here before being moved on, and must have been remarkable self-=disciplined or under powerful restraint.</p><p> 空间站已经被用作庞大的过境设施，舒适地满足了数千名乘客。没有船员宿舍或人群控制职位。甚至单个小屋的缺失表明，这位乘客只在继续前进时花了很短暂的时间，并且必须是纪律或在强大的克制下的纪律或纪律处分。</p><p>   A period of growing confusion. Two of our number set out 48 hours ago to explore the lower decks of the station, and so far have failed to return. We have carried out an extensive search and fear that a tragic accident has taken place. None of the hundreds of elevators is in working order, but our companions may have entered an unanchored cabin and fallen to their deaths. We managed to force open one of the heavy doors and gazed with awe down the immense shaft. Many of the elevators within the station could comfortably carry a thousand passengers. We hurled several pieces of furniture down the shaft, hoping to time the interval before their impact, but not a sound returned to us. Our voices echoed away into a bottomless pit.</p><p>   一段不断增长的混乱。我们的两个号码载于48小时前探索车站的较低甲板，到目前为止未能返回。我们已经进行了广泛的搜查，担心发生了悲惨事故。数百个电梯都没有工作秩序，但我们的同伴可能已经进入未经警告的小屋并落入他们的死亡。我们设法迫使其中一个沉重的门并刺激令人敬畏的轴。车站内的许多电梯可以舒适地携带一千名乘客。我们向轴上击倒了几件家具，希望在他们的影响前的间隔时间，但没有回到我们的声音。我们的声音回荡成无底坑。 </p><p> Perhaps our companions are marooned far from us on the lower levels? Given the likely size of the station, the hope remains that a maintenance staff occupies the crew quarters on some remote upper deck, unaware of our presence here. As soon as we contact them they will help us to rescue our companions.</p><p>也许我们的同伴们在较低的水平上远离我们？鉴于车站的可能规模，希望维修人员在一些偏远的上层甲板上占据船员宿舍，不知道我们在这里的存在。一旦我们联系他们，他们将帮助我们拯救我们的同伴。</p><p>   Once again our estimate of the station’s size has been substantially revised. The station clearly has the dimensions of a large asteroid or even a small planet. Our instruments indicate that there are thousands of decks, each extending for miles across an undifferentiated terrain of passenger concourses, lounges, and restaurant terraces. As before there is no sign of any crew or supervisory staff. Yet somehow a vast passenger complement was moved through this planetary waiting room.</p><p>   我们再次估计车站尺寸已经大幅度修改。该电台清楚地具有大小小小小小小小小小门的尺寸。我们的仪器表明，有数千名甲板，每个甲板延伸到乘客的乘客，休息室和餐厅露台的未分化地形。就像任何机组人员或监督人员没有迹象一样。然而，以某种方式通过这个行星候车室移动了巨大的乘客补充。</p><p> While resting in the armchairs beneath the unvarying light we have all noticed how our sense of direction soon vanishes. Each of us sits at a point in space that at the same time seems to have no precise location but could be anywhere within these endless vistas of tables and armchairs. We can only assume that the passengers moving along these decks possessed some instinctive homing device, a mental model of the station that allowed them to make their way within it.</p><p> 虽然在十字架下方的扶手椅中休息，但我们都注意到了我们的方向感光如何消失。我们每个人都坐在空间的一个点，同时似乎没有精确的位置，但可以是这些无穷无尽的桌子和扶手椅内的任何地方。我们只能假设沿着这些甲板移动的乘客拥有一些本能的归位装置，该车站的心理模型使他们能够在它内完成。</p><p> In order to establish the exact dimensions of the station and, if possible, rescue our companions, we have decided to abandon our repair work and set out on an unlimited survey, however far this may take us.</p><p> 为了建立车站的确切尺寸，如果可能，救助我们的同伴，我们决定放弃我们的维修工作并阐述了无限制的调查，但这可能会带我们。</p><p>   No trace of our companions. The silent interior spaces of the station have begun to affect our sense of time. We have been traveling in a straight line across one of the central decks for what seems an unaccountable period. The same pedestrian concourses, the same mezzanines attached to the stairways, and the same passenger lounges stretch for miles under an unchanging light. The energy needed to maintain this degree of illumination suggests that the operators were used to a full passenger complement. However, there are unmistakable signs that no one has been here since the remote past. Clearly, whoever designed the station based the transit system within it on a time-table of gigantic dimensions.</p><p>   没有追踪我们的同伴。车站的静音内部空间已经开始影响我们的时间感。我们一直在一个中央甲板上的直线行驶，因为似乎是不负责任的时期。同样的行人绰号，与楼梯相同的夹层，也是相同的乘客休息室在不变的光线下伸展英里。维持这种照明程度所需的能量表明，运营商用于全乘客补充。但是，自遥远过去以来，没有人没有人在这里。显然，无论谁在巨大尺寸的时间表中都在其中设计了该站的过境系统。</p><p> We press on, following the same aisle that separates two adjacent lounge concourses. We rest briefly at fixed intervals, but despite our steady passage we sense that we are not moving at all, and may well be trapped within a small waiting-room whose apparently infinite dimensions we circle like ants on a sphere. Paradoxically, our instruments confirm that we are penetrating a structure of rapidly increasing mass. Is the entire universe no more than an infinitely vast space terminal?</p><p> 我们按照与两个相邻的休息室奇类分隔的相同过道的过道。我们以固定的间隔短暂地休息，但尽管我们稳定的段落，我们感觉完全没有动作，可能会被困在一个小型等候室内，其明显无限尺寸我们像球体上的蚂蚁一样圈出。矛盾的是，我们的仪器确认我们正在渗透迅速增加质量的结构。整个宇宙是否不仅仅是一个无限巨大的空间终端？</p><p>   We have just made a remarkable discovery! Our instruments have detected that a slight but perceptible curvature is built into the floors of the station. The ceilings recede behind us and dip fractionally towards the deck below, while the disappearing floors form a distinct horizon.</p><p>   我们刚刚做出了一个卓越的发现！我们的仪器检测到略微但可察觉的曲率内置在车站的地板中。天花板后面后退，朝下朝向下面的甲板下降，而消失的地板形成了一个明显的地平线。 </p><p> So the station is a curvilinear structure of finite form! There must be meridians that mark out its contours, and an equator that will return us to our original starting point. We all feel an immediate surge of hope. Already we may have stumbled on an equatorial line, and despite the huge length of our journey we may in fact be going home.</p><p>因此，该站是有限形式的曲线结构！必须有标志着它的轮廓和赤道来归还我们原始起点的子午线。我们都觉得立即激增希望。我们已经偶然发现了赤道线，尽管我们的旅程很大，但我们实际上可能会回家。</p><p>   Our hopes have proved to be short-lived. Excited by the thought that we had mastered the station, and cast a net around its invisible bulk, we were pressing on with renewed confidence. However, we now know that although these curvatures exist, they extend in all directions. Each of the walls curves away from its neighbors, the floors from the ceilings. The station, in fact, is an expanding structure whose size appears to increase exponentially. The longer the journey undertaken by a passenger, the greater the incremental distance he will have to travel. The virtually unlimited facilities of the station suggest that its passengers were embarked on extremely long, if not infinite, journeys.</p><p>   我们希望被证明是短暂的。我们掌握了我们掌握了该车站的思想，并围绕着无形散装的网，我们正在努力再次信任。但是，我们现在知道虽然存在这些曲率，但它们在所有方向上延伸。每个墙壁都绕着邻居，从天花板上铺板。事实上，该站是一种扩展结构，其大小似乎是指数增长的。乘客的旅程越长，他将要旅行的增量距离越大。车站的几乎无限制的设施表明，如果不是无限，旅程，其乘客们已经开始了极为漫长的人。</p><p> Needless to say, the complex architecture of the station has ominous implications for us. We realise that the size of the station is a measure, not of the number of passengers embarked—-though this must have been vast—but of the length of journeys that must be undertaken within it. Indeed, there should ideally be only one passenger. A solitary voyager embarked on an infinite journey would require an infinity of transit lounges. As there are, fortunately, more than one of us we can assume that the station is a finite structure with the appearance of an infinite one. The degree to which it approaches an finite size is merely a measure of the will and ambition of its passengers.</p><p> 毋庸置疑，车站的复杂结构对我们具有不祥的影响。我们意识到车站的大小是一种措施，不在乘客的数量上探讨 - 虽然这一定是宽阔的 - 但是必须在它内部进行的旅程的长度。实际上，理想情况下应该只有一个乘客。孤独的旅行者踏上无限之旅，需要无限的过境休息室。因为有幸的是，我们中的一个人以上我们可以假设该站是一个有限的结构，具有无限的结构。它接近有限尺寸的程度仅仅是乘客的意志和野心的衡量标准。</p><p>   Just when our spirits were at their lowest ebb we have made a small but significant finding. We were moving across one of the limitless passenger decks, a prey to all fears and speculations, when we noticed signs of recent habitation. A party of travelers has paused here in the recent past. The chairs in the central concourse have been disturbed, an elevator door has been forced, and there are the unmistakable traces left by weary voyagers. Without doubt there were more than two of them, so must regretfully exclude our lost companions.</p><p>   就在我们的精神处于最低的EBB时，我们已经少了一个小但重要的发现。当我们注意到近期居住迹象时，我们正在跨越无限的乘客甲板，这是一种牺牲的所有恐惧和猜测。最近的旅行者派对暂停了这里。中央大街上的椅子受到了干扰的，电梯门被迫，疲惫的盗贼留下了明显的痕迹。毫无疑问，其中两个以上，所以必须遗憾地排除我们失去的同伴。</p><p> But there are others in the station, perhaps embarked on a journey as endless as our own!</p><p> 但车站还有其他人，也许踏上了无穷无尽的旅程！</p><p> We have also noticed slight variations in the decor of the station, in the design of light fittings and floor tiles. These may seem trivial, but multiplying them by the virtually infinite size of the station we can envisage a gradual evolution in its architecture. Somewhere in the station there may well be populated enclaves, even entire cities, surrounded by empty passenger decks that stretch on forever like free space. Perhaps there are nation-states whose civilizations rose and declined as their peoples paused in their endless migrations across the station.</p><p> 我们还注意到该站的装饰方面的略有变化，在轻型配件和地板瓷砖的设计中。这些可能看起来微不足道，但将它们乘以车站的几乎无限大小，我们可以设想其架构中的渐变演变。在车站的某个地方可能会有人口稠密的飞地，甚至整个城市，被空的乘客甲板包围，延伸永远像自由空间一样。也许有国家的文明州的州，因为他们的人民在他们的无尽迁移中暂停了他们的职位。</p><p> Where were they going? And what force propelled them on their meaningless journeys? We can only hope that they were driven forward by the greatest of all instincts, the need to establish the station’s size.</p><p> 他们去哪儿了？什么力量推动他们的毫无意义的旅程？我们只能希望他们是最伟大的所有本能的推动，需要建立车站的规模。 </p><p>   We are jubilant! A growing euphoria has come over us as we move across these great concourses. We have seen no further trace of our fellow passengers, and it now seems likely that we were following on of the inbuilt curvatures of the station and crossed our own tracks.</p><p>我们是喜庆！随着我们跨越这些伟大的奇异，越来越多的兴奋已经过来了。我们没有看到我们的同伴乘客的进一步追踪，现在似乎有可能我们关注该站的内置曲线并越过我们自己的轨道。</p><p> But this small setback counts for nothing now. We have accepted the limitless size of the station, and this awareness fills us with feelings that are almost religious. Our instruments confirm what we have long suspected, that the empty space across which we traveled from our own solar system in fact lies within the interior of the station, one of many vast lacunae set in its endlessly curving walls. Our solar system and its planets, the millions of other solar systems that constitute our galaxy, and the island universes themselves all lie within the boundaries of the station. The station is coeval with the cosmos, and constitutes the cosmos. Our duty is to travel across it on a journey whose departure point we have already begun to forget, and whoses destination is the station itself, every floor and concourse within it.</p><p> 但是这种小挫折现在没有任何东西。我们接受了车站的无限大小，这种意识填补了我们几乎宗教的感情。我们的仪器确认了我们长期涉嫌何种目的，我们从我们自己的太阳系旅行的空间实际上是位于车站的内部，其中许多庞大的Lacunae是其无休止的弯曲墙壁。我们的太阳能系统及其行星，数百万其他太阳系构成了我们的银河系，岛屿宇宙本身都躺在车站的界限内。该电台与宇宙共同，并构成宇宙。我们的职责是在旅行中旅行，他的出发点我们已经开始忘记，而Whers Whersing Destination是车站本身，每个楼层和大厅。</p><p> So we move on, sustained by our faith in the station, aware that every step we take thereby allows us to reach a small part of that destination. By its existence the station sustains us, and gives our lives their only meaning. We are so glad that in return we have begun to worship the station.</p><p> 因此，我们继续前进，通过我们对车站的信仰来持续，意识到我们所采取的每一步都允许我们到达该目的地的一小部分。其存在，车站维持我们，并使我们的生活成为他们唯一的含义。我们很高兴，以回报为止，我们已经开始崇拜车站。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/roauss.htm">http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/roauss.htm</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/认出/">#认出</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/车站/">#车站</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
