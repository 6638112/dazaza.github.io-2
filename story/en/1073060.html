While trying to ignore the smell of dank, sweaty boots, I eavesdropped on a conversation between an old-time ski patroller and a young lift operator.</p><p>在12月的一个下雪寒冷的下午，大约4:30，我坐在阿斯彭高地滑雪巡逻队的更衣室里。当我试图忽略潮湿、出汗靴子的气味时，我偷听到一位老滑雪巡警和一位年轻的电梯操作员之间的对话。</p><p> The liftie was lamenting his current situation: living in his truck, washing up at the rec center, occasionally catching warm nights and hot showers at a new girlfriend’s place. There’s nowhere available or affordable to live.</p><p>liftie对自己目前的处境感到惋惜：住在卡车里，在rec中心洗碗，偶尔在新女友家里享受温暖的夜晚和洗热水澡。没有地方可以住，也没有地方负担得起。</p><p> The older guy empathized. He’d squeezed into affordable housing back in the ’80s and was still under the same roof. Skating on the margins of the town where he’d pegged his career. “It was hard when I started, and I think it’s much harder now,” he said, checking his watch to see when he’d have to catch his bus down the valley.</p><p>那个年长的人同情他。早在上世纪80年代，他就挤进了经济适用房，至今仍处于同一屋檐下。在他职业生涯的终点城市边缘滑冰。“我刚开始的时候很难，我想现在更难了，”他一边说，一边看表，看他什么时候才能赶上下山谷的巴士。</p><p>  That struggle is backed up by math. There’s a metric called the Gini coefficient that measures inequality by plotting dispersion of income. A Gini coefficient of 0 indicates perfect equality while 1 means total inequality.</p><p>这场斗争得到了数学的支持。有一个称为基尼系数的指标，通过绘制收入差距来衡量不平等。基尼系数0表示完全平等，1表示完全不平等。</p><p> According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent American Community Survey, the national Gini coefficient is .48. Aspen’s is .56.</p><p>根据美国人口普查局最近的美国社区调查，全国基尼系数为.48。阿斯彭的是.56。</p><p> Megan Lawson, an economist at the Headwaters Institute based in Bozeman, Montana, who studies community development in the American West, says it’s an indicator for how far apart the haves and have-nots are. She uses it to try to capture the experience of people working in communities like Aspen, and to quantify why it’s hard for them to keep pace when expenses like housing and health care keep rising.</p><p>梅根·劳森是位于蒙大拿州博兹曼的源头研究所的经济学家，他研究美国西部的社区发展。她说，这是富人和穷人之间差距的一个指标。她用它试图捕捉在阿斯彭这样的社区工作的人们的经验，并量化为什么在住房和医疗保健等费用不断上涨的情况下，他们很难跟上步伐。</p><p> Those disparities are wide and getting wider across the West. According to the Colorado Center on Law and Policy’s self-sufficiency standard published in 2018, in Aspen’s Pitkin County, a family of two (an adult and a preschooler) needs an annual income of $71,274 to make ends meet. That’s way above the 2021 federal poverty benchmark of $17,420 for a family of two, and the highest standard in the state. The Pitkin county manager has found that a quarter of households fall under the standard. In a picture-perfect utopia, one in four families is struggling to pay their bills.</p><p>这些差距在整个西方国家非常大，而且越来越大。根据科罗拉多州法律与政策中心2018年发布的自给自足标准，在阿斯彭的皮特金县，一个两口之家（一个成年人和一个学龄前儿童）需要71274美元的年收入才能维持收支平衡。这超过了2021的联邦贫困基准，17420美元的家庭，这是国家的最高标准。皮特金县经理发现，四分之一的家庭不符合标准。在一个完美的乌托邦中，每四个家庭中就有一个在努力支付账单。</p><p>  Maybe it sounds like what’s happening in your local community. Because it’s not just the dirtbag ski patrollers who are having a hard time. And it’s definitely not just happening in Aspen.</p><p>也许这听起来像是你们当地社区发生的事情。因为不只是dirtbag滑雪巡警的日子不好过。这肯定不仅仅发生在阿斯彭。</p><p> I was in that locker room because I spent the past few winters on the road, writing a book about the appeal of skiing, and the reality of living in mountain towns. And when I was there, I found a lot of darkness. The book, which started as a love letter to a sport that has shaped my life, quickly evolved into an investigation of the inequality I found, and the way it’s winnowing down any kind of middle class and making it harder to thrive if you’re not at the top of the income pyramid in the West — and more broadly, in America.</p><p>我之所以在更衣室，是因为过去的几个冬天我在路上度过，写了一本关于滑雪的吸引力和生活在山区城镇的现实的书。当我在那里的时候，我发现了很多黑暗。这本书最初是写给一项塑造了我生活的运动的情书，很快就演变成了对我发现的不平等现象的调查，以及这种不平等现象对任何一种中产阶级的影响，如果你不在西方——更广泛地说，在美国——收入金字塔的顶端，那么你就更难茁壮成长。</p><p> Places like Aspen — and other resort towns like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, or Park City, Utah — might seem like rarefied dreamlands where the standard of living is unrealistically high. But the growing gap between wages and wealth is a national trend, and what’s happening to the locals in ski towns is also what’s hollowing out the middle class across America: flat wages, consolidated wealth, governmental austerity and an increased cost of living.</p><p>阿斯彭（Aspen）等地——以及怀俄明州杰克逊霍尔（Jackson Hole）或犹他州帕克城（Park City）等其他度假城镇——可能看起来像是稀薄的梦境，那里的生活水平高得离谱。但是，工资和财富之间日益扩大的差距是一种全国性趋势，滑雪城当地人的遭遇也在掏空美国各地的中产阶级：工资持平、财富巩固、政府紧缩和生活成本增加。</p><p> According to data from Pew Research Center and others, inequality is real and getting worse across the country. Ski towns, with their skewed baseline of desirability and reliance on service workers, provide an interesting lens into the high highs and low lows of that inequality. They’re the canary in the coal mine for how a top-heavy economy can’t hold itself up, and how that imbalance trickles into everything from mortgage rates to mental health.</p><p>根据皮尤研究中心和其他机构的数据，不平等是真实存在的，而且在全国范围内变得越来越严重。滑雪城的理想性和对服务业工人的依赖性基线存在偏差，这为了解这种不平等的高低提供了一个有趣的视角。他们是煤矿里的金丝雀，因为一个重量级经济体无法自立，这种不平衡如何渗透到从抵押贷款利率到心理健康的各个方面。</p><p>  It can feel grim, but the bright side is that those towns are also trying to address some of those issues fast — because they have to. So in the face of that, maybe there are some lessons for the lowlands, too.</p><p>这可能会让人感到严峻，但好的一面是，这些城镇也在努力快速解决其中一些问题——因为他们必须这样做。因此，面对这一点，也许低地也有一些教训。</p><p>  In 1894, local minders pulled a 2,340-pound silver nugget out of Aspen’s Smuggler Mine, the area’s final foray into a high-dollar heyday. Back then it was an industry town, booming and bustling. But extraction bottomed out before the economy turned to skiing.</p><p>1894年，当地看护人员从阿斯彭的走私矿中取出了一块2340磅重的银块，这是该地区最后一次进入高美元鼎盛时期。当时它是一个工业城镇，繁荣而繁华。但在经济转向滑雪之前，开采量已经触底。</p><p> In the beginning of the 20th century, when the mines tapped out, the town’s population shrank from 10,000 to 750. Aspen was dead quiet until the late ’30s and early ’40s, when skiers started poking around the mountains and running a rope tow up the face of Roch Run, on what’s now Aspen Mountain, in the middle of town.</p><p>20世纪初，当矿井被开采时，该镇的人口从1万人减少到750人。阿斯彭直到30年代末和40年代初才安静下来，这时滑雪者开始在山上四处奔跑，在罗什跑的路上拖着一条绳子，在现在镇上的阿斯彭山上。</p><p> Chicago socialite Elizabeth Paepcke showed up in the first wave of skiers. She came in 1938, hitched a ride up the back of the mountain, skied down the face, and became enamored of the place and its potential as a ski area. In 1945, she convinced her businessman husband, Walter, who had become wealthy manufacturing cardboard containers, to move to Aspen and invest in the nascent ski operation and the idea of Aspen as a destination.</p><p>芝加哥社交名媛伊丽莎白·佩普克出现在第一批滑雪者中。她于1938年来到这里，搭便车登上山后，滑下了滑雪场，并对这个地方及其作为滑雪场的潜力着迷。1945年，她说服自己的商人丈夫沃尔特（Walter）搬到阿斯彭（Aspen）投资新成立的滑雪场，并提出将阿斯彭作为目的地的想法。沃尔特已成为制造硬纸板集装箱的富人。</p><p> They connected with a wave of recently returned war veterans who had seen the ski towns of the Alps and wanted to create something similar. Walter worked with former 10th Mountain Division soldier Friedl Pfeifer to plan the first ski lift in town. In 1946, they founded the Aspen Skiing Corp. with two other 10th Mountain veterans, Johnny Litchfield and Percy Rideout.</p><p>他们联系了一批最近回国的退伍军人，这些退伍军人曾参观过阿尔卑斯山的滑雪城，并希望创造类似的东西。沃尔特与前第十山地师士兵弗里德尔·普费弗合作，策划了该镇的第一个滑雪缆车。1946年，他们与另外两名第十届山地老兵约翰尼·利奇菲尔德和珀西·里迪奥特成立了阿斯彭滑雪公司。</p><p> Walter built the airport and started laying down groundwork for Aspen’s growth, spinning it out into a Promised Land, trying to envision what it would look like when outsiders like him started, hopefully, flooding in. It was a version of the lauded American dream: If you build it, they will come.</p><p>沃尔特修建了机场，并开始为阿斯彭的发展奠定基础，将其打造成一片应许之地，试图想象当像他这样的外人开始涌入时会是什么样子，希望如此。这是一个备受赞誉的美国梦的版本：如果你建造了它，它们就会到来。</p><p> They did, and the same was true of the rash of other ski areas springing up across the U.S., many of them started by other 10th Mountain Division soldiers. As the ski industry, and really the tourism industry in general, grew in the middle of the last century it bolstered a new kind of economy, based on leisure time, exploration and recreation.</p><p>他们做到了，美国各地涌现出的大量其他滑雪场也是如此，其中许多滑雪场都是由第十山地师的士兵发起的。由于滑雪业，以及真正的旅游业，在上个世纪中叶成长起来，它支持了一种新的经济，以休闲时间、探索和娱乐为基础。</p><p> In the ’60s and ’70s, as thousands of local ski hills sprung up in cold, mountainous towns, skiing became a way for middle-class families to get outside in the depths of winter. It was accessible and wide ranging. But toward the end of the century, as ownership consolidated, and mountainside real estate became more desirable and valuable, the sport — and the towns became more exclusive and expensive.</p><p>在60年代和70年代，随着数千座当地滑雪山在寒冷的山区城镇拔地而起，滑雪成为中产阶级家庭在深冬外出的一种方式。它很容易到达，范围很广。但到了本世纪末，随着所有权的巩固，山坡上的房地产变得越来越受欢迎，越来越有价值，这项运动——以及城镇变得更加排他性和昂贵。</p><p> Aspen, as a ski town, was supposed to be paradise. The Paepckes and the other people who turned Aspen into a tourist destination conceived it as a place where people could get away from their everyday lives to consider higher truths. But any kind of utopia is inherently exclusive. If you have something desirable and limited, like a crystalline valley in the Rockies, capitalism doesn’t do much to keep it untouched and gorgeous. Demand quickly outguns supply, tipping the scales toward excess. When you put bounds around a place to keep it pristine, you’re pushing certain things, and certain people, out of town.</p><p>阿斯彭作为一个滑雪城，本应是天堂。帕普克斯和其他把阿斯彭变成旅游目的地的人把它想象成一个人们可以远离日常生活去考虑更高真理的地方。但任何一种乌托邦都具有内在的排他性。如果你有一些令人向往和有限的东西，比如落基山脉的水晶谷，资本主义并不能让它保持原样和华丽。需求很快超过了供给，导致天平过度倾斜。当你在一个地方周围设置界限以保持其原始状态时，你就把某些东西和某些人赶出了城镇。</p><p> If you’re visiting a ski town, you might not think about the embedded economics — I don’t often think about these things on vacation — but the outdoor industry is an $887 billion economy in the U.S., and it’s growing. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in Colorado, it’s 2.5% of the state’s GDP. In Utah, outdoor recreation contributes more than $4.9 billion in GDP and 61,890 jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p><p>如果你去滑雪城，你可能不会想到嵌入式经济——我在度假时不经常想到这些东西——但户外产业在美国是一个8870亿美元的经济体，而且它正在增长。根据经济分析局的数据，在科罗拉多州，这是该州GDP的2.5%。据美国经济分析局（U.S.Bureau of Economic Analysis）的数据，在犹他州，户外娱乐为GDP和61890个就业岗位贡献了超过49亿美元。</p><p> Recreation has long been lauded as a way to help wean Western towns away from extraction and a new way to use natural capital, but it can become a chicken-and-egg cycle. You need the buzz of a resort (or many) to pull people in and keep the engine of recreation going.</p><p>长期以来，娱乐一直被誉为帮助西方城镇摆脱采掘业的一种方式，以及利用自然资本的一种新方式，但它可能成为一种鸡和蛋的循环。你需要一个（或许多）度假胜地的嗡嗡声来吸引人们，保持娱乐的动力。</p><p> That can be a good thing: There wouldn’t be many jobs in a valley like Aspen without the resort, and nearby towns like Somerset, which never embraced tourism after the mines closed, struggle with retaining jobs and residents. But it’s an industry that caters to outsiders, and that single-sided, wealth-based economy can crush the culture that it feeds from. And that’s true of industries far beyond skiing, from manufacturing to education.</p><p>这可能是一件好事：没有度假村，像阿斯彭这样的山谷里就不会有很多工作机会，而像萨默塞特这样的附近城镇，在矿山关闭后从未接受过旅游业，却在努力留住工作机会和居民。但这是一个迎合外来者的行业，这种片面的、以财富为基础的经济可能会摧毁它赖以生存的文化。从制造业到教育业，这对滑雪以外的行业也是如此。</p><p>  In her research, Lawson has found that across the West people are moving to counties with recreation opportunities more quickly than to other places — and there’s faster job growth in those towns. But if you pull apart the numbers there is darkness there. Abundant growth doesn’t always lead to equitable growth.</p><p>在她的研究中，劳森发现，在整个西部，人们搬到有娱乐机会的县的速度比搬到其他地方要快，而且这些城镇的就业增长更快。但是如果你把这些数字分开，那里是黑暗的。充足的增长并不总是导致公平的增长。</p><p> The Aspen area is a good example of that. According to Pitkin County, in 2021, the average income was $49,460, while the state average was just over $63,026. In Pitkin, wages for accommodation and food services, the sec- tor that encompasses essentially any kind of tourism job as well as many service jobs, were $49,460.</p><p>阿斯彭地区就是一个很好的例子。据皮特金县统计，2021，平均收入为49460美元，而州平均收入仅为63026美元。在皮特金，住宿和餐饮服务的工资为49460美元，基本上包括任何类型的旅游业工作以及许多服务性工作。</p><p> “Tourism has the most jobs, but they pay the least,” says Rachel Lunney, director of Northwest Colorado Council of Governments Economic Development District.</p><p>西北科罗拉多州政府委员会经济开发区主任雷切尔·伦尼（Rachel Lunney）说：“旅游业的工作岗位最多，但薪水最低。”。</p><p> She says those discrepancies cascade out in all sorts of complicated, deceiving ways. For instance, unemployment rates are low, which is often a sign of economic vitality, but in Aspen, it’s a false signal of stability. Because the basis of the economy is lower-paying service sector jobs, to make ends meet, people tend to work more than one job — a statistic that isn’t usually tracked. They might be employed, maybe even more than full time, but they’re struggling to earn enough to get by, and that’s true among service workers across the country, from big cities to isolated rural towns.</p><p>她说，这些差异以各种复杂、欺骗的方式层出不穷。例如，失业率很低，这通常是经济活力的标志，但在阿斯彭，这是稳定的错误信号。由于经济的基础是收入较低的服务业工作，为了维持收支平衡，人们往往从事不止一种工作——这一统计数据通常不会被追踪。他们可能有工作，甚至可能超过全职，但他们正在努力挣得足够的钱来维持生计，这在全国各地的服务业工人中都是如此，从大城市到偏远的农村城镇。</p><p> Wage growth has been sluggish in the U.S. for the past 40 years, and Lunney says that local wages haven’t changed much either. They’re barely keeping pace with inflation, and while wages have stagnated, other sources of income have surged into the county.</p><p>过去40年来，美国的工资增长一直很缓慢，伦尼说，当地的工资也没有太大变化。他们几乎跟不上通货膨胀的步伐，虽然工资停滞不前，但其他收入来源已经涌入该县。</p><p> In the past decade, remote work options have skyrocketed, increasing 400% since the pandemic. And in the face of COVID-19, knowledge workers flooded out of cities in droves. People who are making money in, say, Silicon Valley, can move to Aspen without directly needing to derive money from the local economy, which has accelerated economic disparity.</p><p>在过去十年中，远程工作选择激增，自大流行以来增加了400%。面对2019冠状病毒疾病，知识工作者成群结队地涌出城市。比如说，在硅谷赚钱的人可以搬到阿斯彭，而无需直接从当地经济中赚钱，因为当地经济加速了经济差距。</p><p> It was already bad before it got worse. Former Pitkin County Mayor Mick Ireland did a study a few years ago and found that from 1970 to 2017, while average earnings per job grew 30%, per capita income grew 301%. In November 2021, Pitkin’s per capita income was $155,067 — more than three times the average wage, which means that most of the earnings in the county weren’t coming from wages or the local economy. Instead, Lunney says they’re likely coming from things like investment income, dividends and retirement income, and other accruals of outside wealth, especially after COVID-19 hit and more remote workers moved in.</p><p>情况在恶化之前就已经很糟糕了。前皮特金县市长米克·爱尔兰（Mick Ireland）几年前做了一项研究，发现从1970年到2017年，虽然人均工作收入增长了30%，但人均收入增长了301%。2021年11月，皮特金的人均收入为155067美元，是平均工资的三倍多，这意味着该县的大部分收入不是来自工资或地方经济。相反，2019冠状病毒疾病可能来自投资收入、股息和退休收入等其他财富，尤其是在CVID-19和更多的远程工作者进入之后。</p><p>  “It’s really hard to track people who are making money in other places but spending it here, and living here,” Lunney says. And those people who make money elsewhere fundamentally change how goods and services are valued, and how the local economy is stacked up.</p><p>“很难追踪那些在其他地方赚钱但在这里消费、住在这里的人，”伦尼说。而那些在其他地方赚钱的人从根本上改变了商品和服务的价值，以及当地经济的堆积方式。</p><p> For instance, that average wage of $49,460 won’t get you too far in a town where the typical home value is $2.5 million, which it was this year in Aspen — up 19.4% over the past year, according to Zillow. Almost everything else in town, from health care to taxes to groceries at one of the town’s two markets, is more expensive than the rest of the state, according to the county.</p><p>例如，在一个典型的房屋价值为250万美元的小镇上，平均工资为49460美元不会让你走得太远，根据Zillow的数据，今年阿斯彭的房屋价值为250万美元，比去年增长了19.4%。据该县称，镇上几乎所有其他东西，从医疗保健到税收，再到镇上两个市场之一的食品杂货，都比该州其他地方贵。</p><p>  Again, it’s not just Aspen. This spreading disparity is happening across the country, and it’s getting worse. According to data from the Economic Policy Institute, U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, as the cost of living has gone up and wages have stayed flat, it’s harder for everyone (besides the wealthiest) to get by.</p><p>再说一遍，不仅仅是阿斯彭。这种不断扩大的差距正在全国范围内发生，而且正在变得更糟。根据经济政策研究所、美国人口普查局和美国无家可归问题机构间委员会的数据，随着生活成本上升，工资持平，每个人（除了最富有的人）都很难过日子。</p><p> Jackson Hole, which has the nation’s highest per-capita income from assets according to a study by the Economic Innovation Group, is a clear case. Because Wyoming doesn’t have personal or corporate income taxes, Jackson Hole has become a tax haven for the wealthy. When they set up residency there, they get the double benefit of a ski house (which they can often cover with tax write-off money), and a highly reduced tax burden.</p><p>根据经济创新组织（Economic Innovation Group）的一项研究，杰克逊霍尔（Jackson Hole）的人均资产收入是美国最高的，这就是一个明显的例子。由于怀俄明州没有个人或企业所得税，杰克逊霍尔已经成为富人的避税天堂。当他们在那里定居时，他们可以得到滑雪场的双重好处（他们通常可以用税收注销金来支付），以及大大减轻的税收负担。</p><p> Jonathan Schechter, a Town Council member and economist who studies inequality in ski towns, says that means the county has some of the highest per-capita income in the country, and a massive wealth gap. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the top 1% of earners in Teton County, Jackson Hole’s home, make 132% more than those in the bottom 99% — the highest income disparity in any county in the country.</p><p>研究滑雪城不平等问题的镇议会议员兼经济学家乔纳森·谢赫特说，这意味着该县拥有全国最高的人均收入和巨大的贫富差距。据经济政策研究所（Economic Policy Institute）的数据，杰克逊·霍尔（Jackson Hole）的家乡提顿县收入最高的1%的人比收入最低的99%的人多挣132%——这是全国收入差距最大的县。</p><p> “Roughly 85% of income earned by Teton County is investment income, leaving 15% for wages, and that’s not much,” he says. He says that makes it hard for most locals to make ends meet, and that makes it hard for them to invest in the community, and their tax base can’t cover their local needs for things like school funding or social services, even when there is a lot of wealth in the area.</p><p>“提顿县大约85%的收入是投资收入，剩下15%是工资收入，这并不多，”他说。他说，这使得大多数当地人很难收支相抵，也使得他们很难在社区投资，而且他们的税基无法满足当地人对学校资金或社会服务等方面的需求，即使该地区有大量财富。</p><p> Jackson is far out on the end of the spectrum, but what’s happening there is indicative of what’s happening in a lot of other places, from Steamboat Springs to Salt Lake City: It’s becoming harder for an average person or family to make a living. When wages aren’t high enough to support the cost of living and there’s no one to work base level jobs it hollows a community out.</p><p>杰克逊远在世界末日，但那里发生的事情表明了从汽船泉到盐湖城等许多其他地方正在发生的事情：普通人或家庭谋生变得越来越困难。当工资不足以支撑生活成本，又没有人从事基本工作时，就会掏空一个社区。</p><p> The place where that erosion shows up most clearly is in housing. The standard logic of the free market is to let whoever is willing to pay the most set the value for a good. That logic fails, or at least becomes deeply unequal, in towns where real estate prices are driven by imported funds and earning potential isn’t aligned with the cost. The market breaks down because the value of goods and services is distorted by both desire and ability to pay, and that means local workers can’t find places to live. Families of four are crammed into small, deed-restricted apartments or cramped single-bathroom houses — with parents driving a 15-year-old vehicle hours into town to get to work — all while bringing in a household income that could provide “normal” middle-class comforts were they in Illinois or Oklahoma. For growing young families — or any locals for that matter — there’s nowhere to grow up or move to.</p><p>侵蚀最明显的地方是住房。自由市场的标准逻辑是让愿意付出最多的人为商品设定价值。在房地产价格由进口资金驱动、盈利潜力与成本不一致的城镇，这种逻辑失败了，或者至少变得极不平等。市场崩溃是因为商品和服务的价值被欲望和支付能力扭曲了，这意味着当地工人找不到居住的地方。四口之家挤进了小型的、有契约限制的公寓或狭窄的单浴室房屋——父母开车15年的汽车花了几个小时进城上班——所有这些都带来了家庭收入，如果他们在伊利诺伊州或俄克拉荷马州，这些收入可以提供“正常”的中产阶级舒适。对于成长中的年轻家庭——或者任何当地人来说——没有地方可以长大或搬家。</p><p>  Across mountain towns, real estate prices are sky high because much of the inventory is in sprawling second homes, corporately owned mega mansions and condos converted into Airbnb rentals. For many of the people who own those homes — like an increasing number of businesses, or those 50-plus billionaires who have places in Aspen — price is basically irrelevant. But their ability to snap up desirable real estate makes things nearly unlivable for people who don’t have that privilege and who are often the people keeping the town running. It’s why entry-level workers like the Highlands liftie can’t find a place to live.</p><p>在整个山区城镇，房地产价格居高不下，因为大部分库存都在庞大的第二套住房、公司拥有的巨型豪宅和转换为Airbnb租赁的共管公寓中。对于许多拥有这些房屋的人来说——比如越来越多的企业，或者那些在阿斯彭拥有房产的50多位亿万富翁——价格基本上是无关紧要的。但他们抢购理想房地产的能力让那些没有这种特权的人几乎无法居住，而这些人往往是维持城镇运转的人。这就是为什么像Highlands liftie这样的入门级员工找不到居住的地方。</p><p> In Mammoth Lakes, California, only 2% of long-term rental houses are vacant, which means places to live are nearly impossible to come by. In Telluride it’s 1%. According to a local newspaper article published in July, 59% of Jackson Hole locals say they’re struggling because of the lack of housing. They live in their vehicles, or drive in from Idaho, braving the curves of Teton Pass on storm days. In Aspen, there was violence in a park-and-ride lot, where people were living in their cars, when one man threatened others with a hatchet. There’s underlying grimness in holding on to these picture-perfect towns, and this is part of a bigger story that’s playing out across the country when the working class can’t live where they work.</p><p>在加利福尼亚州的猛犸湖，只有2%的长期租赁房屋空置，这意味着几乎不可能找到居住的地方。碲化物含量为1%。根据当地报纸7月发表的一篇文章，59%的杰克逊霍尔当地人说，他们因为缺乏住房而苦苦挣扎。他们住在自己的车里，或者从爱达荷州开车来，在暴风雨天冒着提顿山口的弯道。在阿斯彭，一个停车场和骑乘场发生了暴力事件，当时人们住在车里，一名男子用斧头威胁其他人。保留这些风景如画的城镇有着潜在的阴暗，这是一个更大的故事的一部分，这个故事正在全国上演，工人阶级无法在他们工作的地方生活。</p><p>  There are other factors beyond just local wealth that make it hard, like global supply chain issues and the way climate change is pressuring viability via things like water supply. Even if you eliminate from the picture those buying a second home, there’s a geographic crush that makes growth expensive. Development costs are high, and, in places hemmed in by swaths of public lands across the West, there’s not much room to build. Housing is driven by supply and demand, and when it’s impossible to create supply, the demand escalates.</p><p>除了当地财富之外，还有其他一些因素让这一过程变得困难，比如全球供应链问题，以及气候变化通过供水等方式给生存能力带来的压力。即使你把那些购买第二套住房的人排除在外，也会有一种地理上的拥挤，这使得增长变得昂贵。开发成本很高，而且，在被西部大片公共土地包围的地方，没有多少建设空间。住房是由供给和需求驱动的，当不可能创造供给时，需求就会升级。</p><p> Megan Lawson, the Headwaters researcher, found that 45% of Americans have had their housing prices skyrocket for reasons similar to what’s happening in Aspen. “Communities across the country, in every state, are grappling with housing prices increasing at a rate that has not been seen before, even during the housing bubble that led to the Great Recession,” her September 2021 report read.</p><p>源头研究人员梅根·劳森发现，45%的美国人的房价飙升的原因与阿斯彭的情况类似。她在2021年9月的报告中写道：“全国各地，每个州的社区都在以前所未有的速度进行房价上涨，即使在导致大萧条的房地产泡沫期间。”</p><p> As the costs of basic needs like housing grow, the economics becomes untenable for many. People can’t survive on their wages, employers struggle to find workers and some very basic needs get neglected because there’s no one to fulfill them.</p><p>随着住房等基本需求成本的增长，经济状况对许多人来说变得难以维持。人们靠工资无法生存，雇主难以找到工人，一些非常基本的需求被忽视，因为没有人来满足它们。</p><p> “The impacts of record-setting rises in housing prices reverberate through a community and manifest as labor shortages, increased homelessness and dramatic increases in rental costs. Those who are priced out of homeownership today will struggle to build wealth for themselves and their children, exacerbating income inequality,” Lawson’s report says.</p><p>劳森的报告称：“创纪录的房价上涨的影响在整个社区产生了反响，表现为劳动力短缺、无家可归者增加和租金成本大幅增加。如今房价上涨的人将难以为自己和子女创造财富，加剧收入不均。”说。</p><p> I’m an older millennial. Generationally speaking, our parents could generally do better than their parents. Now we only have a 50-50 shot to do as well as our folks.</p><p>我是一个年长的千禧一代。从一代人的角度来说，我们的父母通常会比他们的父母做得更好。现在我们只有50比50的机会和我们的家人一样。</p><p> As my peers move into middle age — which historically comes with middle-class earnings — the majority of us are falling behind past generations. According to a recent Brookings Institution study about the future of the middle class, there are a bunch of factors that are making it tough.</p><p>随着我的同龄人步入中年——这在历史上是中产阶级的收入来源——我们大多数人都落后于上一代。根据布鲁金斯学会（Brookings Institute）最近一项关于中产阶级未来的研究，有一系列因素使其变得艰难。</p><p> People my age and younger saw steep earning declines right when we were trying to get on the curve of building wealth. Stagnant income and falling wages mean that there is minimal upward intergenerational mobility — a factor that used to be consistent for 90% of Americans, regardless of social class. The cost of traditional tickets to financial stability, like higher education or buying a house, has been rising faster than wages. We are getting lost in the spread of inequality, and that has trickle-down effects. So local governments, town planners, major employers and more are trying to figure out creative ways to make their towns more livable.</p><p>当我们试图走上积累财富的道路时，我和我同龄人的收入急剧下降。停滞不前的收入和不断下降的工资意味着代际向上流动性很小——这一因素过去对90%的美国人来说是一致的，无论社会阶层如何。金融稳定的传统门票成本，如高等教育或买房，一直在以高于工资的速度上涨。我们正在不平等的蔓延中迷失方向，这会产生涓涓效应。因此，地方政府、城市规划师、主要雇主和更多人都在试图找到创造性的方法，让他们的城镇更宜居。</p><p> One of the most prominent, immediate ways this is happening in Aspen is through an increase in wages. Over the past few years, Aspen Skiing Co., the area’s biggest employer, has repeatedly increased its minimum wage. In November, the company bumped it to $17 an hour, by way of a $3 million payroll investment. Several other major ski world businesses, including Vail Resorts, have also increased minimums to $15.</p><p>阿斯彭最显著、最直接的方式之一就是增加工资。在过去几年里，该地区最大的雇主阿斯彭滑雪公司（Aspen Skining Co.）一再提高最低工资。去年11月，该公司通过300万美元的工资投资，将其提高到每小时17美元。包括维尔度假村在内的其他几家大型滑雪场企业也将最低价格提高到了15美元。</p><p> It’s an economic trend, driven by both inflation and necessity, that’s also happening in cities like Seattle, and in parts of the federal government. In 2022 the minimum wage for federal contractors will be $15, thanks to an April 2021 executive order. Employers of all sizes are realizing — especially in the face of the “Great Resignation,” where more than 34 million people quit their jobs in 2021 alone — that they have to invest in workers if they want to retain them and keep the wheels turning.</p><p>这是一种经济趋势，受通货膨胀和需求的双重驱动，西雅图等城市以及联邦政府的部分部门也在发生这种情况。2022，联邦承包商的最低工资将是15美元，这要归功于2021年4月的行政命令。所有规模的雇主都意识到——尤其是面对“大辞职”的情况下，2021以上的人中有3400万人独自辞掉了工作——如果他们想留住员工，让轮子转动，他们就必须投资于工人。</p><p> To address the housing problem, towns are trying a range of tactics, from deed-restricted workforce housing to job-based housing taxes, to building boarding houses so they immediately house seasonal workers. They’re working to both create more options and make the current ones more affordable. It’s going to take all those tactics and more, because it’s a multifaceted social problem, not just a supply and demand issue.</p><p>为了解决住房问题，城镇正在尝试一系列策略，从限制契据的劳动力住房到基于工作的住房税，再到建造寄宿房，以便立即安置季节性工人。他们正在努力创造更多的选择，并使目前的选择更实惠。它将采取所有这些策略和更多，因为这是一个多方面的社会问题，而不仅仅是一个供求问题。</p><p>  In December, Aspen hit a wall and the City Council declared an emergency six-month moratorium on new residential land use permits and froze new Airbnb listings. Residents’ opinions were mixed, in part because development is a big part of the local economy, with c</p><p>去年12月，阿斯彭撞上了一堵墙，市议会宣布紧急暂停发放新的住宅用地许可证六个月，并冻结了Airbnb的新房源。居民的意见参差不齐，部分原因是发展是当地经济的重要组成部分，c</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/滑雪/">#滑雪</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/towns/">#towns</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/阿斯彭/">#阿斯彭</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
