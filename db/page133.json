Developers build the future. Microsoft supports you in any language and Java is no exception; we love it. We offer the best Java dev tools, infrastructure, and modern framework support. Modernize your  Java development with Microsoft.\n  While we generally try to have our rankings in July immediately after they are run, we generally operate these on a better late than never basis. On the assumption, then, that August is better than never, below are your RedMonk Q3 language rankings.\n As always, these are a continuation of the work originally performed by Drew Conway and John Myles White late in  2010. While the specific means of collection has changed, the basic process remains the same: we extract language rankings from GitHub and Stack Overflow, and combine them for a ranking that attempts to reflect both code (GitHub) and discussion (Stack Overflow) traction. The idea is not to offer a statistically valid representation of current usage, but rather to correlate language discussion and usage in an effort to extract insights into potential future adoption trends.\n  The data source used for the GitHub portion of the analysis is the GitHub Archive. We query languages by pull request in a manner similar to the one GitHub used to assemble the State of the Octoverse. Our query is designed to be as comparable as possible to the previous process.\n Language is based on the base repository language. While this continues to have the caveats outlined below, it does have the benefit of cohesion with our previous methodology.\n  We use the aggregated history to determine ranking (though based on the table structure changes this can no longer be accomplished via a single query.)\n For Stack Overflow, we simply collect the required metrics using their useful data explorer tool.\n With that description out of the way, please keep in mind the other usual caveats.\n To be included in this analysis, a language must be observable within both GitHub and Stack Overflow.\n No claims are made here that these rankings are representative of general usage more broadly. They are nothing more or less than an examination of the correlation between two populations we believe to be predictive of future use, hence their value.\n There are many potential communities that could be surveyed for this analysis. GitHub and Stack Overflow are used here first because of their size and second because of their public exposure of the data necessary for the analysis. We encourage, however, interested parties to perform their own analyses using other sources.\n All numerical rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. We rank by numbers here strictly for the sake of interest. In general, the numerical ranking is substantially less relevant than the language\u2019s tier or grouping. In many cases, one spot on the list is not distinguishable from the next. The separation between language tiers on the plot, however, is generally representative of substantial differences in relative popularity.\n In addition, the further down the rankings one goes, the less data available to rank languages by. Beyond the top tiers of languages, depending on the snapshot, the amount of data to assess is minute, and the actual placement of languages becomes less reliable the further down the list one proceeds.\n Languages that have communities based outside of Stack Overflow such as Mathematica will be under-represented on that axis. It is not possible to scale a process that measures one hundred different community sites, both because many do not have public metrics available and because measuring different community sites against one another is not statistically valid.\n    Besides the above plot, which can be difficult to parse even at full size, we offer the following numerical rankings. As will be observed, this run produced several ties which are reflected below (they are listed out here alphabetically rather than consolidated as ties because the latter approach led to misunderstandings).\n   As has become typical of third quarter runs, this round of the language rankings was fairly static. Whether the causal factors there are related to seasonal vacations, continuing impacts from the pandemic or some other combination of variables is unclear, but after last quarter\u2019s run featured half the languages in the Top 20 changing spots in some way, this quarter\u2019s run features only two such changes. Those changes, however, are quite notable, as is the lack of movement from several languages as we\u2019ll discuss.\n Java (1): After spending a few quarters demoted to third place in our rankings, prompting questions from observers as to whether it was fated to a gradual drift down these rankings, Java surged back into a tie for second place with Python. This would be less of a surprise but for many of the language\u2019s competitors \u2013 and, it should be said, the odd industry analyst or two \u2013 writing regularly recurring epitaphs for the stalwart of enterprise infrastructure. The language once created to run cable set top boxes continues to be a workhorse, and importantly one that has consistently been able to find new work to do. Java\u2019s performance on these rankings continues to impress, all these years later, and as it\u2019s shown a remarkable ability to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape it\u2019s a language that would be difficult to bet against.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 22:59:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f16\u7a0b,java,programming,github,python", "title":

"note_en": "Accurate description of effects is not hair-splitting; it is much-needed exactness to avoid adding confusion to an extraordinarily complicated and tense scientific and societal debate around COVID-19 vaccines.\n It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine\u2014a general misconception of vaccine protection also found in a\u00a0 Lancet Infectious Diseases\u00a0Editorial.\n This  appeared in correspondence in a March 8th publication through The Lancet, a leading peer reviewed medical journal. It emphasizes that even within the scientific communities focused on such issues, misunderstandings about the meaning and implications of reported numbers about vaccine efficacy persist. If the scientific community makes a mistake in its own interpretations, that can misinform policy makers, even very educated ones, and that in turn can misinform the public.\n In the last few weeks I have seen evidence of articles more widely shared to correct some of the early misconceptions The Lancet correspondence was concerned about. However a more insidious form of misunderstanding and misinformation lingers, and is pervasive.\n  Tom is no ordinary doctor. He is the  former Director of the Center for Disease Control under President Barack Obama. He is also propagating dangerous misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines. It will cause people to misunderstand the real world results which can cause more people to die, and exacerbate the pandemic.\n Dr. Tom is wrong. About as wrong you can get. The real world data has shown that the death rate among the  vaccinated, if infected with COVID, can be  3 to 5.7 times higher 1 than the death rate of the  unvaccinated.\n    The former Director of the CDC is making what I call an Acceptable Catastrophic Error. This is the kind of error one is allowed to make when they are perceived to have the correct opinion. Arguments and statistics used towards the goal of getting every single person vaccinated for COVID are given far less scrutiny and are accepted as true more readily, than any arguments or statistics that might be perceived as counterproductive towards that goal.\n When the former Director of the CDC, or anyone else for that matter, says someone who is infected with COVID is 100 times less likely to die if they have been vaccinated, it does not matter how far off that number is. It will be readily forgiven no matter how inaccurate. It is the goal of universal vaccination, not truth, that appears to be most important.\n   In order to understand why people are claiming these marvelous additional benefits exist, we will unfortunately have to do some math. But once we do, confusion will be alleviated, and the dangerous misinformation being spread by those in authority and those on a mission to convince everyone to get vaccinated, will become clear.\n To understand vaccine efficacy, a diagram provided in the results of a Pfizer\u2013BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2  clinical trial will be very useful.\n  The red line with circles shows that for those who received the vaccine, which was 21,669 people, the rate of infection slowed. The average number of days between individual infections increased. The result is that over a period of time, the total number of people who became infected was indeed far lower than the unvaccinated group.\n This is where the earlier statement from from The Lancet \u201cwho would have become diseased with COVID-19 had they not been vaccinated\u201d comes into play. It is reasonably assumed that the red line would resemble the blue line if the group were unvaccinated. Therefore one could count the number of squares on the blue line that occur in between instances of red circles, and get a ratio of how many unvaccinated people got infected per each vaccinated person over a period of time.\n  The efficacy rating (VE in the table) is a way of trying to do this. However one additional layer of complexity is added. Researchers treat the people in study without much distinction. Every day that a person is included in the study and observable is considered a person-day. Every person being observed on a given day is counted and added to a tally of person-days. At the end of the study, the observed infections are divided by the total person-days counted for the group.\n For example, if two people are observed across four days, it is a total of eight person-days. Each person has a chance of infection each day, unless they were already infected. It makes a total of eight chances for a person to become infected. However, once infected, someone cannot be infected again, so that person stops being counted in the person-day tally. In this particular case they used a different length of time than day, but the idea is the same.\n At the end of the day, the efficacy calculation is the result of  counting things and dividing things counted. We can take the numbers they counted and divide them ourselves to arrive at the same efficacy numbers. Let\u2019s use the data from  \u2265 7 days after dose 2. We have 21,314 people across 4.015 time units for the vaccinated group, and 21,258 people across 3.982 time units for the unvaccinated. Now we compare the rates of infection, which were 9 and 172 observed infections respectively.\n  Finally, we take the two rates, and compare them, and compute a number that represents the percent score called  efficacy.\n  There is the efficacy number from the table. Subtracting from 1 simply allows you to report a number where higher is better, instead of using \u201cgolf rules\u201d where lower is better. The calculation itself is not misleading if you understand how it is derived. But it is important to hold on to the idea we are currently talking about   infection rates over time  only. It is perfectly reasonable to compare infection rates among two groups in this way.\n This distinction is all the more important as, although we know the risk reduction achieved by these vaccines under trial conditions, we do not know whether and how it could vary if the vaccines were deployed on populations with different exposures, transmission levels, and attack rates. 2\n   Israel offered a glimpse into the real world dynamics of the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. A major  study, published May 2021 in The Lancet, reviewed national surveillance data, collected as part of a government vaccination initiative. The data collected was able to identify those vaccinated on which dates; when they were diagnosed with COVID; whether they were symptomatic or not; if and when they went to the hospital; if they had severe or critical hospitalization; and if they died.\n The study is quite thorough, although it did contain  errors some of which may not have been fully corrected. But we can jump directly to inspecting the efficacy numbers and correcting errors. We will be using the numbers provided in Table 4 on page 1825.\n  The top white box contains the number of infections observed during the study. We can use  All Ages. The  Unvaccinated and  Vaccinated infections for  All Ages were 109,876 and 3,642 respectively. Just as before, we need the person-days (the total time observed) for both. These are provided at the bottom of the table and for the Unvaccinated and Vaccinated they are 120,076,136 and 170,434,659 respectively.\n   Taking a look at our approximate ratios calculated, you can see that 91.5 in the red square in the table corresponds to our calculated unvaccinated rate, and similarly 2.1 in the blue box corresponds to our calculated vaccinated rate. We would simply need to multiply both by 100,000, as they are  incidence rates per 100,000 person-days, to make them about equal to the table.\n The next step is identical to the Pfizer phase three trial. \u201cVaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as (1 \u2013 IRR) \u00d7 100\u201d ( Incidence Rate Ratios, IRR)\n  Our calculation appears to be 1.1% higher than that in the table. There are two possible explanations. One explanation may be that when they  corrected some hard values they failed to update the efficacy calculation. The second explanation is that the authors ran the raw data, which we do not have, through a particular statistical package 3 in order to estimate the bounds (numbers in parentheses, giving some wiggle room to the estimate), which gave them a more nuanced estimate for the central incidence rates than the numbers they provide the reader allow \u2014 as our calculated incidence rates are clearly in agreement with the table.\n This isn\u2019t too important, as these are simply estimates the authors are making based on observations. These estimates will change over time and with different populations. They are very useful to have, but should not be treated as if they\u2019re exact.\n They are also not where the major issues arise. One can simply look at the raw numbers without calculating the efficacy number and conclude that indeed, infection rates were substantially lower. The differences that remain in their calculation for efficacy percentage are negligible.\n Next, however, we move to what will ultimately be the source of misinformation. It isn\u2019t the fault of the report itself, but a consequence of too many people who pretend to speak from knowledge and authority interpreting numbers they do not understand.\n   Included in the study are rates of symptomatic COVID, hospitalization, severe hospitalization, and their respective efficacy calculations. At the bottom of the table are efficacy calculations related to   death. We will use the table to make one final efficacy calculation so we can move to discussing this  horrific source of misinformation.\n  We are given 36 deaths among those aged 16-44 in the unvaccinated group and 0 deaths in the vaccinated group. We have 88,938,310 and 61,397,072 person days for unvaccinated and vaccinated respectively from the bottom of the table. This gives us, indeed 100% efficacy!\n  100% Efficacy! That\u2019s 100% protection against death! Those between the ages 16-44  cannot die from COVID! You can see how impossible it is for someone to die if vaccinated, as they do not even provide a range of uncertainty. 100% with no uncertainty is as  certain as you can get.\n  It is obviously possible for vaccinated people 16-44 to die from COVID. The other results from this efficacy from death calculation are  just as flawed, and are being dangerously misused. Let us revisit Dr. Tom, the former CDC director.\n  Hyper-vigilant mass-vaccination advocates have been using the vaccine efficacy \u201cfrom death\u201d numbers in this Israeli study to claim that   if you get COVID you have additional protection because of the vaccine. Some may quote the percentage (\u201cit\u2019s 96% effective at preventing death!\u201d) so as to not be accused of inventing their own numbers. But if you have made it this far, you have performed the efficacy calculation three separate times now.  Counting things and dividing things counted.\n Nowhere, at any time, in any way, did we look at how many people in the vaccinated group  got COVID  and died. We (and the authors of the study) counted the number of deaths among the vaccinated, and divide by the number of  days, not the number of  infections.\n And if we do actually look at and compare deaths among those actually infected we get a completely different story.\n  Every single additional efficacy number is redundant. All reported results downstream from infection are a  consequence of reduced infections 4. The efficacy rates would all be in the high 90s even if the vaccinated group were  perfectly identical except for infection rate.\n When \u201cformer Director of the CDC\u201d Dr. Tom and others use the non-infection efficacy numbers to discuss the vaccines, they are, intentionally or not, misleading the public. It is something that should end immediately.\n With the exception of infection rates, the efficacy numbers convey no useful information to citizens about their risks once they have been vaccinated. Instead, it may cause the vaccinated to place themselves and others at greater risk if they operate on this misinformation.\n The efficacy numbers, other than infection, which are all  downstream effects of infection, are being used and accepted as if they are additional, layered benefits at every stage of COVID infection.\n  This diagram is how they are being communicated and how they are being received by the clear majority of public figures and citizens. If you are vaccinated it is being communicated that the study showed that you are:\n  If the efficacy numbers were layered measures of additional protection then the observations would have been different in the Israeli study (All Ages) 5.\n  With numbers this small, these differences may seem negligible. But when scaled up not just across populations but also across time, the impact of affecting people\u2019s decision making when choosing what level of infection risk to assume, can dramatically alter the situation.\n These are currently  Acceptable Catastrophic Errors being made each and every day by nearly everyone. It is hard to fathom how much more wrong someone could be yet still maintain their credibility after this. But because these are  acceptable catastrophic errors, if I am successful in clearing up confusion, those spreading the misinformation will simply move on to the next acceptable catastrophic error.\n  When you actually take a look at who was infected and who died by age group, the idea of additional protection disappears for most.\n   When you are finally  counting things and dividing things counted which matter, such as how many infected people went on to die in each group, no remnant of the 90% numbers remain. In the graph above 6, there is no information available to suggest the death rate per infection is any different in the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group. You can see why by revisiting the number infected and the number who died in each group.\n 36 of 84611 in the unvaccinated versus 0 in 1066 in the vaccinated group. 36 in 84611 is roughly 1 in 2350, but we only had 1066 infected in the vaccinated group. There is not enough information to claim the death rate per infection is higher or lower, and that uncertainty is indicated in the graph above. That is worlds away from the relative immortality communicated by the efficacy number 100%.\n In fact, if there had been  24 deaths in the vaccinated group the efficacy reported would have been 3%! Because it was looking at rates over time, 24 deaths would have been the death rate over time similar to 36 in the unvaccinated group. But clearly, among those infected, 36 in 84611 is a far lower death rate than 24 in 1066!\n The death rate for the ages 16-44 among infected would need to have been almost  53 times higher to report the vaccine was 3% effective at  preventing death.\n     For ages 45-64, there again isn\u2019t enough evidence to conclude that the infection/case fatality rate is any different, but as the bluish dots indicate, the numbers we have actually lean towards a  higher death rate among the vaccinated.\n The silver lining though is that among those 65 and over, the observed death rate in the trial gives us decent reason to believe that  maybe the vaccine can reduce the death rate for this group. Since they were the most vulnerable all along, this is a promising result.\n  If you were to notice that a number of people died after vaccination, and inferred that the vaccine must have  caused the death, you would be committing what is known as the \u201cpost hoc ergo propter hoc\u201d fallacy.\n This is a simple enough fallacy to explain. Just because B happened after A does not mean B was  caused by A. Causation requires more knowledge to deduce.\n If you were to commit this fallacy communicating concern over vaccination you would be quickly told by pro-mass-vaccination advocates of this flaw in reasoning. However the same error is committed by the pro-mass-vaccination crowd without any internal pressure checking the reasoning.\n We have great reason to assert a causal relationship between decreased infection rates and vaccination. The mRNA vaccines were designed to have a causal mechanism of interaction. Observing the intended effects of the causal mechanism on the macro level (fewer infections) is reasonable to attribute to the engineered mechanism on the micro level.\n We have far less reason to assert causation  downstream from preventing infection. The pro-vaccinate-everyone crowd has used their incorrect understanding of how the efficacy numbers were derived, and made post hoc ergo propter hoc arguments with them. Even when the data does not show  any difference, a misreading and misunderstanding of efficacy numbers is automatically combined with post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning, compounding errors.\n   On any given day on social media, you can find someone who has been vaccinated saying they contracted COVID, and they just  know that but for the vaccine they would have been in worse shape. These announcement get shared widely. It is wonderful that people have avoided some of the worst symptoms, but the data has not supported the observation that the vaccine offers significant downstream benefits for most people.\n  The repetition of this false idea, that there are amazing and significant additional benefits outside of mere reduced infection rates, will result in people taking increased risks.\n The person who  incorrectly assumes that \u201cwith the vaccine,  even if I get infected I am less likely to die than I would be without the vaccine,\u201d will be more likely to engage in behavior that risks infection. They may become the \u201cit\u2019s just a flu bro\u201d of the vaccinated.\n If the lack of observed layered protection were made more explicit then people may choose to still wear masks and social distance, to further reduce their exposure in addition to vaccination. They may choose to go to fewer social events. This in turn would reduce the infection rate, and reduce the probability a mutation that evades vaccination finds a host to practice on. (While writing this article, the White House  changed its masking recommendation for the vaccinated)\n Those who strongly believe everyone should get vaccinated may still choose to promote the efficacy numbers as additional layers of protection, because their goal is to encourage people to get vaccinated. Misleading use of numbers in advertising is a tale as old as time. But they are doing so at the cost of both their honesty and integrity, and sacrificing some of the actual benefits that vaccination provides, by giving people incorrect information to base their choices on.\n  Those who like to say \u201cthe numbers speak for themselves\u201d are the least likely to understand what the numbers are saying. The studies that make epidemiological assessments are reporting to a different audience than the numbers reported are being presented to. To the extent that some studies may exist where these values are calculated conditionally, they are incompatible with the ones that have been computed unconditionally. This information is unlikely to be contained in the spreading of these numbers, as they are more often going to be used interchangeably.\n  A hospital trying to plan resources and staffing cares about the estimated daily hospitalization and death rate given how many people are vaccinated. A policy maker deciding among options to fight coronavirus, cares what the daily rates are for various metrics after a policy is adopted.\n An individual, for the most part, does not care about the daily rate in the population. They care what their  own odds, or those of their loved ones, are.\n It does not matter to an individual if the daily observed rate of infection is low across all people, if they  themselves are at significantly higher risk. However, absent other measures that can guide an individual risk assessment, a report of daily infection rates if vaccinated compared to unvaccinated does give someone a useful measure at the level of making the choice to get vaccinated.\n But once an individual becomes vaccinated, the daily rate of hospit\n......", "posttime": "2021-08-07 22:58:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

as fuselages \u201cdegrading at an accelerated rate\u201d in the long-range aircraft, further escalating a monthslong dispute with the European airplane maker over the issue.\n       While Airbus declined to specifically discuss the announcement, Qatar Airways&#39; decision to ground the aircraft raised questions about the A350s&#39; carbon composite fuselage, designed to make the twin-aisle aircraft lighter and cheaper to operate by burning less jet fuel. Qatar Airways also is one of the world&#39;s top operators of the aircraft.\n    In its statement, Qatar Airways said it had been monitoring the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft for some time. It described the issue as a \u201csignificant condition,\u201d without elaborating.\n \u201cFollowing the explicit written instruction of its regulator, 13 aircraft have now been grounded, effectively removing them from service until such time as the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition,\u201d the airline said in its statement.\n Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. The airline has another on order with the Toulouse, France-based airplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 aircraft \u2014 the most of any airline worldwide. In June, Qatar Airways said it wouldn&#39;t take any more A350s unless the problem was fixed.\n  \u201cAs a leading aircraft manufacturer we are always in talks / working with our customers,\u201d a statement said. &#34;Those talks we keep confidential. We have no further comment on our customer\u2019s operations.\u201c\n Currently, Singapore Airlines is the world&#39;s top operator of the A350, with 56 now in its fleet. The airline did not respond to a request for comment. In America, Delta Air Lines has 15 in its fleet. The Atlanta-based carrier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n The A350 has a list price as much as $366.5 million, though buyers often get discounts in bulk deals.\n Qatar Airways CEO, Akbar al-Baker, is known for his hard-changing, confrontational approach in negotiating with manufacturers and others.\n The airline will be the crucial carrier for fans attending the upcoming

what it will be like for future explorers to live on the surface of Mars.\n  While participants would not need to strap into a rocket and blast off into the final frontier, they would help pave the way for the future of space exploration, all without ever leaving the ground.\n  &#34;The series of missions - known as Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog - includes three one-year Mars surface simulations based at NASA&#39;s Johnson Space Center. The analogs will support research to develop methods and technologies to prevent and resolve potential problems on future human spaceflight missions to the Moon and Mars,&#34; according to  NASA.\n The missions will involve four people living in a module where they will encounter various challenges simulating a mission on the Red Planet.\n &#34;The analog is critical for testing solutions to meet the complex needs of living on the Martian surface,&#34; said Grace Douglas, lead scientist for NASA&#39;s Advanced Food Technology research effort at the Johnson Space Center located in Houston, Texas. &#34;Simulations on Earth will help us understand and counter the physical and mental challenges astronauts will face before they go.&#34;\n NASA is calling for non-smoking applicants who are either American citizens or permanent residents proficient in the English language and between the ages of 30 and 55. NASA, which noted that compensation is available for taking part, also described various qualifications related to education and experience.\n &#34;Each mission will consist of four crew members living and working in a 1,700-square-foot module 3D-printed by ICON, called Mars Dune Alpha. The habitat will simulate the challenges of a mission on Mars, including resource limitations, equipment failure, communication delays, and other environmental stressors. Crew tasks may include simulated spacewalks, scientific research, use of virtual reality and robotic controls, and exchanging communications. The results will provide important scientific data to validate systems and develop solutions,&#34; NASA explained.\n While there are ambitions to return to the moon and reach Mars in the future, humans have not been back to the moon since 1972.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 22:57:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "In 2013 I wrote a  Chronicle  column about the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Master of Applied Positive Psychology program.\n I chose the MAPP program because it sent me some goofy unsolicited marketing emails, so, fair game! And it represented trends I thought were important: Famous universities were using the unregulated, debt-financed master\u2019s-degree market to exploit brand names that were incredibly valuable in theory but tricky to monetize in practice.\n Notably, MAPP is not offered by Penn\u2019s highly ranked psychology department. \u201cPositive Psychologist\u201d isn\u2019t an actual job. The program mostly seems to teach people who already have jobs the tenets of Professor Martin Seligman\u2019s extremely  popular and controversial theories about the power of positive thinking, which have been  described by critics as closer to a religion or self-help regime than a legitimate academic field.\n  I made sure to emphasize that the one-year MAPP program, which required students to be on campus for a single weekend per month, cost over $45,000. It seemed like a lot of money at the time.\n Much has happened in the eight years since. The long-term decline in undergraduate enrollment sent university business managers hunting for other sources of revenue. Public financial support for higher education in some states never recovered from the aftermath of the Great Recession. Universities increasingly partnered with for-profit firms to launch expensive online master\u2019s programs, sharing tuition with corporations listed on the Nasdaq. Much of it was financed with federal student loans that swelled to  $1.6 trillion outstanding.\n And in a testament to the power and influence of opinion columnists, the MAPP program looked on the bright side and increased tuition and fees to $71,662.\n  Way back when, it was hard to know if a given master\u2019s degree provided any real value to students. Then the U.S. Department of Education released a  database of debt and earnings information for graduate programs. Last month,   The Wall Street Journal  used the data to expose Ivy League programs that offered a terrible return on borrowed investment. Film students at Columbia were typically borrowing $181,000 apiece before entering a job market that pays less than $30,000 per year.\n People who assume world-famous universities wouldn\u2019t exploit na\u00efve students were shocked. People who know better because they work in academe got defensive: Many master\u2019s programs are affordable and lead to good jobs, they noted.\n Sure. #Notallmastersdegrees. Most police officers don\u2019t wantonly beat up and murder their constituents. We still have a police-brutality problem.\n  The question is how long the proliferation of questionable master\u2019s programs is going to last, and what might happen if the higher-education industry doesn\u2019t get it under control.\n The Department of Education database lists more than 44,000 master\u2019s programs, a testament to how graduate school has become a common way station for many career paths \u2014 and how aggressively universities have moved into the market, searching for profits.\n Most programs are too small to yield debt-and-earnings information that meets the department\u2019s strict privacy thresholds. Scroll through the rest and the most obvious patterns are around types of programs as much as types of institutions. Some observations:\n Borrowing $118,000 to become an acupuncturist who earns $18,000 a year may not be a wise financial decision. I\u2019m looking at you, Emperor\u2019s College of Traditional Oriental Medicine.\n  The whole apparatus of university-based arts education is a financial catastrophe for students. Taking on loads of debt to train for a profession that is commonly modified by the word \u201cstarving\u201d is a terrible idea, and it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of college is involved. For-profit, nonprofit, public \u2014 the numbers are awful. Columbia got dinged because it\u2019s Columbia, but film-studies programs at other universities don\u2019t look much better.\n Visual and performing arts: bad. Fine and studio arts: bad. Drama and theater: bad. I\u2019m sure colleges will say that arts training is time- and labor-intensive, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right. But that doesn\u2019t excuse them from moral responsibility for their position in a system that puts 100 percent of the financial risk on young people who may not be that financially oriented to begin with.\n It\u2019s not great that Penn has a program that costs approximately $71,562 more than the price of ordering some of Martin Seligman\u2019s books from Amazon. But a lot of real psychology programs have problems, too. Students are borrowing doctor money for therapist wages. Northwestern has a clinical psychology master\u2019s program with median debt of $142,000 and median earnings of only $43,000. Others aren\u2019t that bad, but they\u2019re still bad.\n In some fields, the type of college matters a lot. If you want an affordable accounting degree that leads to a well-paying first job, go to a public or nonprofit university. If you want to pay more and get less, go to a for-profit school like DeVry, the University of Phoenix, or Purdue Global.\n  Many colleges and universities have been around for so long, it\u2019s easy to see them as the most stable of institutions. But there\u2019s a volatility inherent to serving a public mission while competing in a private market. Most college administrators and professors I know are genuinely committed to students and scholarship. They also have bills to pay and expensive things they want to buy.\n The master\u2019s degree market has been destabilized by several factors that converged around the same time. Unlimited federal borrowing for graduate school came in 2005. The economy crashed three years later, followed shortly by the crest of the millennial enrollment wave. Meanwhile, advances in online pedagogy and internet technologies made it possible to create fully online programs that were good enough to stand behind \u2014 and sell to anyone in the world.\n Master\u2019s degrees are also the credentials least bound by historical norms, government regulation, or, in many cases, professional bodies. Ph.D.s are controlled by the faculty. Bachelor\u2019s degrees are hard-set in form and function and colleges have to publicly report their admissions selectivity and incoming test scores. They\u2019re also subject to strict federal borrowing limits.\n  But while some master\u2019s degrees are wired into professional licensure or well-established labor market standards, many others aren\u2019t. That\u2019s the soft part of the system that colleges have learned to exploit. Public universities at least have to get state or system approval for new programs. Nonprofits can essentially conjure up a master\u2019s degree in anything, charge whatever they like, and be exempt from government rules that target for-profit colleges.\n Nonprofits can conjure up a master\u2019s degree in anything, charge whatever they like, and be exempt from government rules that target for-profit colleges.\n All of this might continue to run smoothly, immune from the occasional news investigation and cranky columnist, except for one thing: Those graduate students loading up on federal debt are increasingly paying their loans back using income-based repayment plans. That puts them on track to have their loans forgiven after 10 or 20 years, depending on their career, and  that means the bill for all these dubious master\u2019s programs will ultimately fall on the federal taxpayer.\n Two policy responses are likely. First, an end to unlimited borrowing and loan forgiveness for graduate school, which would hit the virtuous and the guilty alike. Students enrolled in expensive programs would have to borrow from the private market, most likely on worse terms than federal loans. Access to graduate school would diminish, but so would students\u2019 ability to make poor financial decisions. Without a blank check from the bank of Uncle Sam, grad schools might take tuition increases off autopilot.\n Second, an expansion of the income- and debt-based regulations that the Obama administration originally applied to for-profit colleges, and which the Biden administration is working to revive. Most master\u2019s programs are, for all intents and purposes, for-profit, regardless of who technically runs them. Regulations that disqualify programs with high debt and low earnings from receiving federal aid would force universities to reappraise master\u2019s degrees that frequently leave graduates in dire straits.\n The master\u2019s degree party hasn\u2019t ended yet. But the more universities put their short-term financial interests above student well-being, the sooner it will.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 22:56:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d,master,\u5927\u5b66", "title": "\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u8bc8\u9a97", "title_en": "The Great Master\u2019s-Degree Swindle", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-great-masters-degree-swindle", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d", "master", "\u5927\u5b66"]}]
