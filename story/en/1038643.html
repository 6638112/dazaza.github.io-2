This post is going to be about a single, concrete example — about an argument that started me down this path in the first place.</p><p>在上一篇文章中，我研究了基本原理思考是如何失败的。这篇文章将只涉及一个具体的例子-首先是关于一个论点的开始。</p><p> A couple of months ago, a friend sent me a blog post titled   Startups Shouldn’t Raise Money, over at a website called ensorial.com. I thought that the post was tightly argued and reasonably put together, with each proposition leading logically and coherently to the next. I also noticed that the author had taken the time to construct their argument from first principles … which meant it was difficult to refute any individual clause in their chain of reasoning.</p><p> 几个月前，一个朋友在一个名为ensorial.com的网站上给我发了一篇博客文章，标题为“创业公司不应该筹集资金”。我认为该职位经过了严格的论证并合理地组合在一起，每个命题在逻辑上和前​​后连贯。我还注意到，作者花了一些时间从第一原则构建论点……这意味着很难在其推理链中反驳任何单独的条款。</p><p>   “Well …” I began. And then I stopped. I realised I didn’t have a good argument for  why it was wrong. Every axiom and intermediate proposition were ideas that I agreed with. And it wasn’t so simple as the conclusion being flat out mistaken — you  could probably run a small, successful internet business using the ideas laid out in the posts’s argument (internet-based businesses tend to be simpler to manage, and there are many niches you can occupy).</p><p>   “嗯……”我开始说。然后我停了下来。我意识到我没有一个很好的理由来解释为什么这是错误的。每个公理和中间命题都是我同意的想法。它不是那么简单，只是结论被误认为是错误的-您可能可以使用帖子论点中提出的想法来经营一个成功的小型互联网业务（基于互联网的业务往往更易于管理，并且有很多您可以占领的适当位置）。</p><p> But I felt uneasy because I thought the framing wasn’t as  useful. This was a more complex thing to debunk.</p><p> 但是我感到不安，因为我认为构图没有那么有用。这是一件更复杂的事情。</p><p>  It’s easy to think that arguments have just three terminal truth values: right, maybe, and wrong. In practice, arguments (and in particular, the sort of argument that we use to justify actions) have many possible truth values. These include things like ‘got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct’, or ‘is correct but for a  different level of abstraction; doesn’t apply here’, or ‘is partially correct, but isn’t as useful compared to a different framing of things.’ The ensorial.com piece is interesting because I think it is an instance of that last one. It was what pushed me to start thinking about all the various ways first principles thinking could go wrong.</p><p>  很容易想到论点只有三个终极真理值：正确，可能和错误。在实践中，论点（尤其是我们用来证明行为合理的论点）具有许多可能的真值。其中包括“错误的细节，但总体上是正确的”，或“正确的，但抽象水平不同的事物”；不适用于此处”或“部分正确，但与事物的不同构架相比没有用。” ensorial.com很有趣，因为我认为这是最后一个实例。这就是促使我开始思考第一原理思考可能出错的所有各种方式的原因。</p><p>  Raising capital to do a startup reduces skin in the game (you’re spending other people’s money, after all).</p><p>  为创业公司筹集资金可以减少游戏中的皮肤（毕竟您是在花别人的钱）。</p><p> Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions. The author argues this is due to a) having a capital buffer to cushion you, and b) having more time to waste.</p><p> 一旦游戏中的皮肤减少，就容易做出错误的决定。作者认为这是由于a）具有缓冲您资金的资本缓冲，以及b）有更多的时间浪费。 </p><p> The alternative is to forego raising venture capital and to create a sustainable business from the beginning, ‘growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product.’</p><p>另一种选择是放弃募集风险投资，从一开始就创建可持续发展的业务，“与为您的产品赚钱的人数呈线性增长”。</p><p> This aligns incentives: you grow only by solving customer problems that they would pay you for. And you’ll pick the shortest path, because you don’t have the luxury of time given to you by an infusion of other people’s money.</p><p> 这与激励措施保持一致：您只能通过解决客户会为您付费的问题来成长。而且，您会选择最短的路径，因为您没有时间浪费别人的金钱。</p><p> At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s explicitly  wrong with this argument. I agree with all the base ideas, and I found myself nodding to the intermediate propositions. The logical correctness of the argument wasn’t a problem. No, my unease stemmed from experience: I  knew this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital. But I couldn’t begin to construct an argument that went against it.</p><p> 乍一看，这个论点似乎没有任何明显的错误。我同意所有基本思想，并且发现自己对中间命题表示赞同。论证的逻辑正确性不是问题。不，我的不安来自经验：我知道这不是考虑筹集资金的正确方法。但我无法开始提出反对它的论点。</p><p>  My friend and I spent no more than 10 minutes discussing this piece. But in the months after our conversation, I continued to return to the author’s argument. I thought it was interesting because it represented a type of thinking error that you and I are likely to encounter in our lives. The form of the error is subtle, and therefore more difficult to detect; the best description I have for it is: ‘perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not really  wrong — but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing.’</p><p>  我和我的朋友花了不超过10分钟的时间讨论了这一部分。但是在我们交谈之后的几个月中，我继续回到作者的论点。我认为这很有趣，因为它代表了您和我在生活中可能遇到的一种思维错误。错误的形式很细微，因此更难检测；我对此的最好描述是：“完全合理，逻辑合理，并没有真正的错误-但没有其他框架有用或强大。”</p><p> Of course, my obsession was for instrumental reasons: how might you recognise a better framing when you found one? I’ll admit that I was a little naive here: I thought that if I could generalise the structure of this argument, I would be better able to recognise similar errors in the future. Alas, I have not been able to do this to my satisfaction.</p><p> 当然，我的痴迷是出于工具性的原因：找到一个更好的框架后，您怎么可能认识到呢？我承认我在这里有点天真：我认为，如果我可以概括一下该论点的结构，将来会更好地识别类似的错误。 las，我无法做到这一点令我满意。</p><p> (In practice, most of the older entrepreneurs I know seem to understand the problems with such sensemaking. Plausible arguments are dealt with in a simple manner: you try the recommendations that unfold from the analysis, but you remain alert to see if they give you exactly the results you want. If they don’t, you keep the frame for the time being, but you continue to look out for a better explanation. And how would you know if you have found a better way of thinking about your situation? Simple: you listen carefully. In the words of Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok, “you learn to distill wisdom from the air.”)</p><p> （实际上，我认识的大多数老企业家似乎都理解这种意义上的问题。可以通过简单的方式处理合理的论点：您尝试分析中提出的建议，但仍要保持警惕，看看它们是否能给您确切地说是您想要的结果，如果没有，则暂时保留该框架，但您会继续寻找更好的解释，并且如何知道是否找到了一种更好的方式来考虑您的情况？很简单：您要仔细听，用马来西亚大亨罗伯特·库克（Robert Kuok）的话说：“您学会了从空中汲取智慧。”</p><p>  The most I’ve been able to do is to articulate  how the author messed up — and therefore how first principles thinking may fail — something that I  explored in my previous post. The core idea is simple: I believe the author started from a limited set of axioms. If you start from a wrong set of axioms, you would eventually end up with a flawed conclusion. In this case, I think the ensorial.com author started from a deficient understanding of business.</p><p>  我最能做的就是阐明作者是如何弄乱的，以及因此首要原则思考可能会失败的原因，这是我在上一篇文章中探讨的。核心思想很简单：我相信作者从一组有限的公理开始。如果您从一组错误的公理开始，最终您将得出错误的结论。在这种情况下，我认为ensorial.com作者从对业务的了解不足开始。 </p><p> To generalise a little, people with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.</p><p>概括地说，对业务了解有限的人认为业务就是要赚钱。但是那些实际经营企业的人知道，经营企业就是管理现金流。</p><p> And the ensorial.com author’s argument fails because he doesn’t appear to understand this.</p><p> ensorial.com作者的论点失败了，因为他似乎不了解这一点。</p><p>  In 1972, a 32 year old man named John Malone was offered the top job at Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), a cable company. He took charge on April Fool’s Day, 1973.</p><p>  1972年，一个名叫约翰·马龙（John Malone）的32岁男子被提供给有线电视公司Tele-Communications Inc（TCI）担任最高职位。他在1973年愚人节那天负责。</p><p> At the time of his hiring, Malone was president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument that supplied cable boxes and credit to the cable systems companies. He had been offered the Jerrold Electronics job when he was 29 years old, just two years earlier. Before JE, he was at McKinsey Consulting. And before McKinsey, he had a job at AT&amp;T’s famed Bell Labs, where he applied operations research to find optimal company strategies in monopoly markets. Malone concluded that AT&amp;T should increase its debt load and aggressively reduce its equity base through share repurchases — a highly unorthodox recommendation at the time. His advice was delivered to AT&amp;T’s board and then promptly ignored.</p><p> 在任职期间，马龙（Malone）是通用仪器公司（Jerrrold Electronics）的总裁，该公司是通用仪器公司（General Instrument）的部门，向电缆系统公司提供电缆盒和信贷。仅两年前，当他29岁时就被提供给Jerrold Electronics工作。在加入JE之前，他曾在麦肯锡咨询公司任职。在麦肯锡任职之前，他曾在AT＆amp; T著名的贝尔实验室工作，在那里他进行了运筹学研究，以在垄断市场中找到最佳的公司战略。马龙总结说，AT＆amp; T应该通过股票回购来增加债务负担，并大幅度减少其股票基础-当时这是一个非常不合常规的建议。他的建议已提交给AT＆amp; T的董事会，然后立即被忽略。</p><p> Malone had been thinking about the interplay between debt, profit, cash flow, and corporate taxes for some time. In 1972, when he was first offered the TCI job, he had already noticed a number of structural properties in the cable industry that piqued his interest:</p><p> 马龙一直在思考债务，利润，现金流量和公司税之间的相互作用。 1972年，当他第一次获得TCI职位时，他已经注意到电缆行业的许多结构特性引起了他的兴趣：</p><p> The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.</p><p> 电缆行业的订阅收入非常可预测。 60年代的有线电视用户，尤其是农村社区的有线电视用户，渴望升级到有线电视以改善电视接收效果。这些订户每月支付费用，很少被取消。</p><p> Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.</p><p> 电缆特许经营实质上是获得本地垄断权的合法权利，这意味着一旦在给定的地区建立了自己的地位，电缆系统运营商的竞争就会受到限制。 </p><p> The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.</p><p>该行业本身具有非常有利的税收特征-智能电缆运营商可以通过使用债务来构建新系统以及大幅度降低建筑成本来保护其现金流免于税收。一旦折旧在特定系统上用完，他们便可以将其出售给另一家运营商，在那里折旧时钟将重新开始。</p><p> Most importantly, the entire market was growing like a weed: over the course of the 60s and into the start of the 70s, subscriber counts had grown over twentyfold.</p><p> 最重要的是，整个市场像杂草一样增长：在60年代到70年代初，订户数量增长了20倍以上。</p><p> Of course, Malone didn’t have much time to reflect on these observations. He landed at TCI and found the company at the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p> 当然，马龙没有太多时间来反思这些观察。他进入了TCI，发现公司濒临破产。</p><p> Bob Magness, the founder of TCI, had grown the company over the course of two decades using a ridiculous pile of debt — about 17 times revenues, at the time of Malone’s hiring. Malone spent his first couple of years at TCI fighting to keep the company alive. He flew into New York every couple of weeks, hat in hand, renegotiating  covenants and asking for extensions on debt repayments. At one point during a meeting with TCI’s bankers, Malone threw his keys on the table and threatened to walk, leaving the company to the banks. The bankers capitulated, granting TCI a much needed extension.</p><p> TCI的创始人鲍勃·马格内斯（Bob Magness）在过去的20年间通过使用一笔可笑的债务使公司发展壮大，在马龙聘用之时，这笔债务的收入约为其收入的17倍。马龙（Malone）在TCI奋斗的头几年中，他一直努力保持公司的生存。他每两周就坐飞机到纽约，戴着帽子，重新商定盟约，并要求延长还款期限。在与TCI银行家的一次会面中，马龙把钥匙扔到桌上，扬言要走，将公司留给银行。银行投降，为TCI提供了急需的扩展。</p><p> Malone and Magness also had to worry about hostile takeovers, given TCI’s low stock price in the early 70s. They executed a series of complicated financial manoeuvres a year or so after Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.</p><p> 考虑到TCI在70年代初的低股价，马龙和马格尼斯也不得不担心敌意收购。在马龙接手一年左右后，他们执行了一系列复杂的财务操作，将大量股票放入一家控股公司以授予他们多数控制权。后来，他们创建了单独的一类投票股。这些举动使他们对公司有严格的控制权，从而使马龙可以自由地专注于理财。</p><p> After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.</p><p> 经过三年的艰辛，TCI终于从金融灾难的边缘退缩了。然后马龙开始工作。</p><p> Malone understood a few things about the cable industry that many outsiders didn’t. First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber base.</p><p> 马龙了解电缆行业的一些情况，而许多外部人士却不了解。首先，他了解电缆就像房地产：在您构建或购买系统时，预付的固定成本非常高，然后在很长一段时间内都具有高度可预测的垄断现金流。他了解到，如果他用债务为收购融资，他可以继续发展公司，并使用已购系统的折旧（加上贷款本身的冲销）来延迟对该现金流量纳税。第三，马龙了解到，所有这些有线电视用户的免税现金流量可用于a）偿还债务，b）偿还其中一些贷款-仅在必要时；马龙希望将债务收入比保持在五比一的水平，但更重要的是c）向债权人证明TCI是值得的债务人。最后，马龙了解规模带来的好处：获得的TCI越大，获得节目（即节目和节目）的成本越低，因为它可以在整个用户群中摊销这些成本。 </p><p>  The problem was that Wall Street in the 70s and 80s didn’t get any of this. In 1986, brokerage firm E. F. Hutton refused to publish a report on TCI because “we don’t publish reports on companies or industries that don’t show a profit.” And indeed, Malone’s strategy required TCI to show a loss for pretty much forever; for the next 25 years, it was  never in the black.</p><p>问题是70年代和80年代的华尔街对此一无所知。 1986年，经纪公司E. F. Hutton拒绝发布有关TCI的报告，因为“我们不会发布未获利的公司或行业的报告。”确实，马龙的策略要求TCI永远显示亏损。在接下来的25年中，它从未出现过亏损。</p><p> Malone went on a charm offensive. He began talking to Wall Street analysts, explaining his logic. To make his point, Malone created a new accounting metric, something he called ‘earnings before interest, depreciation, and taxes’, or EBITDA.</p><p> 马龙进行了一次魅力攻势。他开始与华尔街分析师交谈，解释他的逻辑。为了说明自己的观点，马龙创建了一个新的会计指标，他称之为“利息，折旧和税前收益”或EBITDA。</p><p>  Through a combination of logic, jawboning, and sheer force of presence, Malone persuaded Wall Street to take a second look at the cable industry, long shunned because of its nonexistent earnings and heavy debt addiction. Malone argued, successfully, that after-tax earnings simply didn’t count; what counted was cable’s prodigious cash flow, funding TCI’s continual expansion. Buying cable was like buying real estate. As the value of TCI’s franchises rose, so would the value of its stock. Net income was an invention of accountants, he declared.  Think about it, he’d tell a young analyst: Because TCI had high interest payments and big write-offs on cable equipment, it produced losses, and because it produced losses it paid hardly any taxes to the government. As long as cable operators collected predictable, monopoly rent from customers, met interest payments, and grew from acquisitions, why worry? Malone liked the mathematics of it: Tax-sheltered cash flow could be leveraged to land more loans to create more tax-sheltered cash flow. A standing joke around TCI was that if TCI ever did report a large profit, Malone would fire the accountants.</p><p>  通过结合逻辑，严格的控制力和强大的存在力，马龙说服华尔街重新审视电缆行业，长期以来一直因其不存在收入和沉重的债务成瘾而回避。马龙成功地指出，税后收益根本不算在内；电缆是巨大的现金流，为TCI的持续扩张提供了资金。买电缆就像买房地产。随着TCI特许经营权的价值上升，其股票的价值也会上升。他宣称，净收入是会计师的发明。想想吧，他告诉一位年轻的分析师：由于TCI支付的利息很高且电缆设备的冲销额很大，因此产生了损失，并且由于产生了损失，因此几乎不向政府缴纳任何税款。只要电缆运营商从客户那里收取可预测的垄断租金，支付利息并从收购中获得收益，为什么还要担心？马龙喜欢它的数学原理：可以利用避税的现金流来获得更多的贷款，以创造更多避税的现金流。关于TCI的一个常人笑话是，如果TCI确实报告了可观的利润，马龙将开除会计师。</p><p> Malone was, essentially, a hacker: he stared deeply at the thicket of accounting rules, tax laws, and possible business moves, and found a strategy that exploited the structural realities he found in front of him. He was the first person to deploy this playbook rigorously, and TCI was amongst the first companies to start using EBITDA as a financial metric. Malone made good on his promise. Over the next 25 years, TCI went from acquiring cable companies to acquiring and investing in programming channels. It eventually became the largest cable company in the United States. It never turned a profit. And the results speak for themselves: from the year that Malone took over, in 1973 — to 1998 when AT&amp;T finally bought it for $48 billion, the compound return to TCI’s shareholders was a phenomenal 30.3%, compared to 20.4% for its competition, and 14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 over the same period. ( Source)</p><p> 从本质上讲，马龙是一名黑客：他深深地盯着会计规则，税法和可能的商业举措的丛林，并找到了一种利用他眼前的结构现实的战略。他是第一个严格部署此手册的人，而TCI是最早开始使用EBITDA作为财务指标的公司之一。马龙信守诺言。在接下来的25年中，TCI从收购有线电视公司到收购和投资编程频道。最终，它成为美国最大的电缆公司。它从未盈利。结果是不言而喻的：从1973年马龙接手的那年到1998年，美国电话电报公司（AT＆amp; T）最终以480亿美元的价格收购了马龙，TCI股东的复合回报率达到了惊人的30.3％，而竞争对手的复合收益率为20.4％ ，同期标普500指数则为14.3％。 （ 资源）</p><p> Amongst business people and savvy investors, Malone’s logic dovetails with a famous saying: ‘cash flow is a fact; profit is an opinion’. Even today, there are people who do not fully understand the games you can play with cash flow. Or — more importantly — they do not understand the  things businesspeople would do for better cash flows.</p><p> 在商人和精明的投资者中，马龙的逻辑与一句名言相吻合：‘现金流是事实；利润是一种意见’。即使在今天，仍然有些人对现金流可以玩的游戏并不完全了解。或者-更重要的是-他们不了解商人为获得更好的现金流而会做的事情。</p><p> In the ‘misunderstood’ bucket, take Amazon, for instance. In 1997, a 33-year old Jeff Bezos announced that he was essentially adopting the same playbook, firing a shot across the bow with his first annual letter to shareholders.</p><p> 在“被误解”类别中，以亚马逊为例。 1997年，现年33岁的杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）宣布，他实际上也采用了同样的剧本，并在致股东的第一封年度信函中对他进行了全面射击。</p><p>  We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than  short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.  (emphasis mine)  We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures. (…)  When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and  maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we&#39;ll take the cash flows.  (emphasis mine)</p><p>  我们将继续根据长期的市场领导地位而不是短期的获利能力或华尔街的短期反应来做出投资决策。 （重点是我的）我们将继续分析性地评估我们的计划和投资有效性，以抛弃那些无法提供可接受回报的计划，并加大对最有效计划的投资。我们将继续从成功和失败中学习。 （…）当被迫在优化我们的GAAP会计报表的外观和最大化未来现金流量的现值之间进行选择时，我们将采用现金流量。 （强调我的） </p><p> For the next two decades, Amazon grew its revenue and made no profits, leading journalist Matthew Yglesias to  write, in 2013: “Amazon, as best I can tell, is a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers.” Bezos enjoyed it so much he put it in his annual letter the same year. Bezos knew what he was doing; Yglesias  didn’t get it.</p><p>在接下来的二十年里，亚马逊增加了收入，却没有盈利，导致新闻记者马修·伊格莱西亚斯（Matthew Yglesias）在2013年写道：“据我所知，亚马逊是一个慈善组织，由投资界的成员经营，为消费者。”贝佐斯非常喜欢它，他于同年在其年度信件中写了它。贝索斯知道他在做什么。伊格莱西亚斯（Yglesias）没明白。</p><p>  So, you might ask, what does John Malone have to do raising venture capital? The answer: more than you might think.</p><p>  因此，您可能会问，约翰·马龙（John Malone）必须做什么来筹集风险投资？答案：超出您的想象。</p><p> The core idea that you should take from Malone’s story isn’t “oh, it’s possible to build a valuable company with no accounting profits” — though that  is a valuable insight — but instead “ there is a whole genre of games that people play with cash flow” and also “ cash flow is often more important to grok than profits.”</p><p> 您应该从马龙的故事中汲取的核心思想不是“哦，有可能建立一个没有会计利润的有价值的公司”（尽管这是一个宝贵的见解），而是“人们玩的游戏种类繁多”现金流量”以及“现金流量通常比利润更重要”。</p><p> One implication of these ideas is that raising capital for a business has more to do with the nature of cash flows in a particular business model than it does anything else.</p><p> 这些想法的一个含义是，为企业筹集资金更多地与特定业务模型中的现金流性质有关，而不与其他任何事情有关。</p><p> Notice, for instance, how Malone’s entire strategy was built around a single fact: that you have to pay up front for cable systems, but then earn back your money via a stable stream of cash for years and years afterwards. Notice how this extreme demand for capital drove Malone to embrace debt, over other sources of capital.</p><p> 例如，请注意，马龙的整个策略是如何建立在一个事实的基础上的：您必须先支付电缆系统的费用，然后在多年后的几年中通过稳定的现金流赚回您的钱。请注意，对资本的极端需求如何驱使马龙承担债务，超过其他资本来源。</p><p> Now notice how closely this resembles the Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, which is the primary business model in today’s startup world.</p><p> 现在，请注意它与软件即服务（SaaS）业务模型的相似程度，后者是当今初创企业的主要业务模型。</p><p> (In SaaS businesses — like Slack, or Zoom — you pay programmers to create software, and then you pay even more money to sales and marketing to land customers. Then the customers pay you a stable stream of cash for years and years afterwards. Same dynamics: high upfront costs, and then a stable stream of comparatively smaller payments later. So while SaaS companies don’t typically use debt the way Malone did, they have — surprise, surprise! —  similar capital requirements.)</p><p> （在诸如Salack或Zoom的SaaS业务中，您付钱给程序员来创建软件，然后您付出更多的钱来进行销售和市场营销以吸引客户。然后，客户多年来一直向您支付稳定的现金流。动态：高昂的前期成本，然后在以后稳定地进行相对较小的付款。因此，尽管SaaS公司通常不像马龙那样使用债务，但它们的资本要求相差无几。 </p><p> Let’s return to the original question posed by the ensorial.com author: why raise money from investors? In fact, why raise money at all? There is only one real answer if you want to reason from first principles:  you raise money due to the temporal nature of cash flows. To put this another way: in many businesses, you must spend money  now to make money  later. This implies that you’ll need a source of capital at the start of many business ventures.</p><p>让我们回到ensorial.com作者提出的原始问题：为什么要从投资者那里筹集资金？实际上，为什么要筹集资金呢？如果您想从第一条原则进行推理，那么只有一个真正的答案：由于现金流的时间性质，您筹集了资金。换句话说：在许多企业中，您必须现在花钱才能以后赚钱。这意味着在开始许多商业活动时，您将需要资金来源。</p><p> This might seem like a stupid, obvious statement to make — and it is! But I’ve learnt that people with little experience of business (or little exposure to equity investing) are likely to miss out on the full implications of this single statement. As I’ve mentioned earlier, those with a limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits; those who have actually run businesses know that operating a business is mostly an exercise of managing cash flows.</p><p> 这似乎是一个愚蠢的，显而易见的声明-的确如此！但是我了解到，没有业务经验（或很少有股票投资经验）的人可能会错失这份声明的全部含义。正如我之前提到的，那些对业务了解有限的人认为，业务全是为了赚钱；那些实际经营过企业的人都知道，经营企业主要是管理现金流量的一种练习。</p><p> Here’s how I learnt this: in my previous company, I used to get frustrated whenever my old boss gave customers discounts in exchange for earlier payments. “We’ve done all this work!” I’d complain, “Why aren’t we getting paid our due?”</p><p> 这是我的学习方法：在我以前的公司中，每当我的老老板给客户折扣以换取较早的付款时，我都会感到沮丧。 “我们已经完成了所有这些工作！”我会抱怨：“为什么我们没有得到应有的报酬？”</p><p> “Well,” he would say, “We need the cash.” I sighed, and said that I understood, but I still didn’t  really get it.</p><p> 他会说：“好吧，我们需要现金。”我叹了口气，说我明白了，但我仍然没有真正理解它。</p><p> Months later, I was kvetching about this practice to someone that I considered a mentor, when he interrupted me mid-rant: “But that  is the logical thing to do, you know right?”</p><p> 几个月后，当我打断我的导师时，我正在向一个我认为是导师的人介绍这种做法：“但这是合乎逻辑的事情，你知道吗？”</p><p>  “Think about it,” my mentor explained, “You’re running a completely bootstrapped business, which means you earn what you can sell. A huge chunk of your capital is locked up in inventory. Now your boss needs that cash back, to pay for expenses. You should view the discount he’s giving to customers as a price he’s willing to pay …  in order to unlock that cash flow.”</p><p>  “考虑一下，”我的导师解释说，“您正在经营一家完全自负盈亏的公司，这意味着您可以赚到可以出售的东西。您的大部分资金都被锁定在库存中。现在您的老板需要现金返还，以支付费用。您应该将他为客户提供的折扣视为他愿意支付的价格……以释放现金流量。”</p><p> It was then that I understood. It took me a few years, but I now get that a  major part of business is simply learning the many games that you can play with cash flow.</p><p> 那时我才明白。我花了几年时间，但现在我知道，业务的主要部分只是学习可以用现金流量玩的许多游戏。 </p><p>   Changing the payment terms on your invoices  instantly makes your company more valuable, because you change the nature of cash flows in your business. (This is  commonly exploited by private equity people, for obvious reasons … but I’ve also written about this before, in my summary of Ram Charan’s   What The CEO Wants You To Know).</p><p>更改发票上的付款条件会立即使您的公司更有价值，因为您会更改业务中现金流量的性质。 （由于显而易见的原因，这通常被私募股权投资人利用……但是我之前在拉姆·查兰（Ram Charan）的《首席执行官希望你知道的事情》摘要中也写过这本书。</p><p>  Once you realise that it is in the nature of businesses to do  all sorts of things to unlock more cash flow, you begin to realise that there are all sorts of interesting ways you can exploit this tendency.</p><p>  一旦意识到做各种事情来释放更多现金流量是企业的天性，您就会开始意识到可以采用各种有趣的方式来利用这种趋势。</p><p> For instance, in   Good Synthesis is the Start of Good Sensemaking, I described the consequences of an upstart competitor embracing lean manufacturing, from the perspective of the incumbent. The competitive advantage afforded by lean manufacturing is subtle: yes, you get to make stuff at a cheaper cost, with better efficiency and a lower error rate. But the true advantage that you get lies in the  consequences of a speedy delivery: if you can guarantee a fast, consistent delivery time from your factory, your downstream distributors may hold less inventory — which in turn means that they would have a better cash position.</p><p> 例如，在《好综合是建立好感官的开始》中，我从任职者的角度描述了新贵竞争者拥抱精益制造的后果。精益制造所提供的竞争优势是微妙的：是的，您可以以更便宜的成本，更高的效率和更低的错误率来制造产品。但是，您获得的真正优势在于快速交货的后果：如果您可以保证从工厂获得快速，一致的交货时间，则下游分销商的库存可能会减少-这又意味着他们将拥有更好的现金状况。</p><p> Why is this cool? Well, you’ll quickly learn that you can  charge a higher price, enjoy higher margins, while still taking market share away from your competitors. Why? Simple: distributors will prefer to hold your product over a competitor’s, given the better cash flow it affords them. (This still requires a certain amount of price inelasticity; for an in-depth look at how this happens, read   Competing Against Time).</p><p> 为什么这很酷？好吧，您会很快了解到，您可以收取更高的价格，享受更高的利润，同时仍能从竞争对手手中夺走市场份额。为什么？很简单：鉴于产品可以为他们提供更好的现金流，因此他们比您的竞争对手更愿意持有您的产品。 （这仍然需要一定程度的价格弹性；要深入了解这种情况如何发生，请阅读《与时间竞争》。）</p><p>   Nick Kokonas is a restauranteur who runs three of the best restaurants and bars in America: Alinea, Next, and The Aviary. A few years after starting in the F&amp;B industry, Kokonas realised that he could  charge for a deposit for a restaurant reservation — something that most people thought was impossible. He began collecting money up front. This changed the dynamics of his business in a pretty radical way. Kokonas  describes what happened next (around 55:44 in this podcast):</p><p>   尼克·科科纳斯（Nick Kokonas）是一位餐厅经营者，他经营着美国最好的三个餐厅和酒吧：Alinea，Next和The Aviary。从事餐饮业几年后，科科纳斯意识到他可以收取餐厅预订的押金-大多数人认为这是不可能的。他开始预先收款。这以一种非常激进的方式改变了他的业务动态。 Kokonas描述了接下来发生的事情（在此播客中大约55:44）：</p><p> Food costs money. But the way that everyone (in the F&amp;B industry) looks at food costs, and paying for food is very weird.
