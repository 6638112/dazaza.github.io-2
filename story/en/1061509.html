It feels almost magical as his familiar Yorkshire voice fills the room even though Burrow is smiling gently rather than moving his lips. “I don’t think you ever know your inner strength until you get told you are dying,” says the former  Leeds Rhinos rugby league international who is a prisoner in his own body. “I would never have known I could be this positive when getting the news.”</p><p>R OB Burrow无法再谈话，然而，在帕蒂省在家里的多雨银行假日晚上，他回答了我对生命和死亡的另一个问题。当他熟悉的约克郡声音填满房间时，它感觉几乎是神奇的，即使洞穴轻轻地笑着笑着而不是移动他的嘴唇。 “我不认为你曾经知道你的内在力量，直到你被告知正在死亡，”前莱兹·鲁尼索斯橄榄球联盟国际在他自己身体中是一个囚犯。 “在获得新闻时，我永远不会知道我可能是这种积极的。”</p><p> The 38-year-old, who  won eight Grand Finals and 20 international caps during a long and memorable career,  has a ravaging form of motor neurone disease. He and his wife, Lindsey, who has been with him since they started going out at the age of 15, received the shattering diagnosis in December 2019. The prognosis was bleak because Burrow was told his life expectancy, while declining rapidly from an incurable disease, would be unlikely to stretch beyond two years.</p><p> 这位38岁的人在长期令人难忘的职业生涯中赢得了八位盛大决赛和20个国际帽子，具有肆无忌惮的运动神经元疾病形式。他和他的妻子林赛曾经和他在一起以来，他们开始于15岁以来，于2019年12月获得了破碎的诊断。预后黯然失色，因为洞穴被告知他的预期寿命，同时从无法治愈的疾病迅速下降，将不太可能延伸超过两年。</p><p>   Burrow’s mind is as sharp as ever and he uses a piece of technology called Eyegaze to respond. His eyes identify individual letters on the screen and then, slowly, he builds words to formulate an answer. When he is ready Rob turns to us with a smile. It is his way of letting Lindsey and me know that, while we have been yakking away, he can reply. Rob fixes his gaze on the send button and his texted answer is spoken by an approximation of his voice – recorded during the earliest months of his illness. He read a book aloud so that the technology could create a memory bank of words said by him.</p><p>   Burrow的思想与以往一样尖锐，他使用一块名为Eyegaze的技术来回应。他的眼睛识别屏幕上的个别字母，然后，慢慢地，他建立了单词来制定答案。当他准备好的时候，带着微笑转向我们。这是他让林女和我知道的方式，虽然我们一直在牦牛，但他可以回复。 Rob在发送按钮上修复他的凝视，他的发言答案是通过近似他的声音的近似的疾病。他大声朗读了一本书，以便该技术可以创造一个记忆库对他说的话。</p><p> Rob points out wryly that, even though he doesn’t really like hearing himself, it is far better that it is his accent “rather than an American robot voice like Stephen Hawking”.</p><p> Rob指出了争吵，即使他真的不喜欢听自己，它就会好多了，这是他的口音“而不是像斯蒂芬·霍克这样的美国机器人的声音”。</p><p> Lindsey sits with us as we approach the end of another moving interview. We have shared an unexpected amount of laughter as this extraordinary couple set me at ease despite Rob’s harrowing illness. Over the past few weeks we have found a pattern for our interviews. While Rob methodically types his answers, Lindsey chats to me. It is like conducting two contrasting interviews simultaneously but they make it easy. “Oh yes, he’s used to me talking every minute anyway,” Lindsey says with a laugh when I ask if Rob can concentrate while we talk.</p><p> 当我们接近另一个移动的采访结束时，Lindsey坐在我们身边。我们已经分享了意想不到的笑声，因为这对非凡的夫妇让我放心，尽管抢劫的令人痛苦的疾病。在过去的几周里，我们已经为我们的采访找到了一种模式。虽然Rob有条理地输入了他的答案，Lindsey对我聊天。这就像同时进行两个对比的采访，但它们使其变得容易。 “哦，是的，无论如何，他曾经习惯了每分钟说话，”当我问罗伯可以在我们谈话时抢劫是否可以集中精力，“Lindsey笑着说。</p><p> Rob explains that his darkest period occurred soon after he lost the ability to talk late last year just as the second lockdown gripped the country. He felt isolated in his stricken body. But his new aid has transformed him.</p><p> Rob解释说，他在去年年底谈话的时候失去了他的第二次锁定抓住了这个国家的能力，他最近的时间很快就会发生。他觉得在他受伤的身体中孤立。但他的新援助改变了他。</p><p> “It has completely changed my life,” he says. “I can express myself again.”</p><p> “它完全改变了我的生活，”他说。 “我可以再次表达自己。” </p><p> Leeds Rhinos 2001-17 493 appearances, 198 tries, 157 goals, 5 field goals, 1111 points   England  2003-13 15 appearances, 12 tries, 12 goals, 72 points   Great Britain 2005-07 5 appearances, 4 tries, 9 goals, 34 points</p><p>利兹犀牛2001-17 493出场，198次尝试，157个目标，5场进球，1111点英格兰2003-13 15出场，12次尝试，12个目标，72点英国2005-07 5出场，4次试图，34点</p><p> Lindsey says the eye-tracking device has been “such a lifeline because it’s Rob’s only means of communication. Simple things are now possible, like being able to ask the kids: ‘How’s your day at school been?’ Or he says: ‘Lindsey, can I have a coffee?’ It’s lovely for me and the kids. They hear him saying that he loves us and it’s totally Rob. So communication is possible again – which is vital.”</p><p> Lindsey说，眼跟踪装置一直是“这样的生命线，因为它是Rob的唯一通信手段。现在是简单的事情，就像能够问孩子们一样：'你在学校的一天过得怎么样？“或者他说：'林赛，我可以喝一杯咖啡吗？'对我和孩子们很可爱。他们听到他说他爱我们，它完全抢劫。因此，沟通再次是可能的 - 这至关重要。“</p><p>  That communication has been deepened by a book about Burrow’s life, called Too Many Reasons to Live, which will be published in August. Written by Ben Dirs, the accomplished ghostwriter, the manuscript is currently being read by Rob. I have read it and Dirs has captured Rob’s old voice, and good cheer, while documenting the two love stories framing his life. The first is a sporting story. It charts the romantic tale of how tiny Rob Burrow conquered brutal old rugby league against all odds, and helped turn Leeds into a powerhouse as they dominated the sport with homegrown stars who came up through the academy with him.</p><p>  这是一本关于洞穴生命的一本书加深的，称为太多的生活原因，将于8月份出版。由Ben Dirs撰写，完成的Ghostwriter，手稿目前正在通过Rob读取。我已经阅读了它，Dirs已经捕获了Rob的旧声音，而且良好的欢呼，同时记录了他生命的两个爱情故事。第一个是一个体育故事。它描绘了浪漫的故事，浪漫的故事是如何针对所有赔率征服残酷的橄榄球联盟，并帮助将利兹转向一个强国，因为他们与他与他一起通过学院提出的本土明星占据了这项运动。</p><p> The second love story is between Rob and Lindsey. It is full of compassion, tenderness and love. “I got sent the first 30,000 words,” Lindsey says, “and I couldn’t put it down. It was way after midnight and I thought: ‘Gosh, I really need to get to bed here.’ It brought back so many memories. I keep hearing Rob laughing while he’s reading.”</p><p> 第二个爱情故事是在抢劫和林赛之间。充满了同情心，温柔和爱情。 “我发了前30,000个单词，”Lindsey说，“我无法把它放下。午夜后，我想：'天哪，我真的需要在这里睡觉。'它带回了这么多的回忆。我一直在读书时听到抢劫笑。“</p><p> The book helped me understand how much Rob still wants to be treated normally. And so even after we talk about difficult subjects he tells me about his enduring love of The Office and how he watched Line of Duty with Lindsey while “trying to work out who ‘H’ was before the final episode – to no avail. I loved watching it with Lindsey because she never has a spare minute.</p><p> 这本书帮助我了解仍然希望正常对待多少抢劫。所以即使在我们谈论困难的科目之后，他告诉我他对办公室的持久的爱，以及他如何用林赛观看职务，而“试图锻炼”H'是在最后一集之前 - 无济于事。我喜欢用Lindsey看着它，因为她从未有备用时间。</p><p> “Lindsey has taken care of me and mothered me as if I was one of the kids. I absolutely hate sympathy and, while I appreciate the empathy people feel for me, I want to be as normal as possible. Having said that, how can it be normal for Lindsey when she has changed from my wife to my full-time carer? The stuff Lindsey does for me shows her true love. I hope she knows I’d do the same for her – even if I’d do a much worse job.”</p><p> “Lindsey照顾了我，母亲妈妈，好像我是那个人一样。我绝对讨厌同情，虽然我欣赏着对我的同情心，我想尽可能正常。话虽如此，当她从妻子改变我的全职照顾者时，林赛怎样才能是怎样的？ Lindsey的东西为我表明了她的真爱。我希望她知道我为她做同样的事情 - 即使我做得更加糟糕的工作。“</p><p> It has felt strangely natural to reflect on the inevitability of death not long after Rob has grinned at the revelation that when one of his old teammates, Barrie McDermott, the imposing former prop, visits him he ends up laughing so much that he cannot stop farting at the same time.</p><p> 它感到奇怪的自然能够反映死亡的不可避免性，而不是抢劫在启示之后咧嘴笑了，当他的一个旧队友，巴利麦德蒙特（Barrie McDermott）的举动，浮雕前方的竞争，他最终笑了起来，他不能停止放屁同时。 </p><p> In a similar way we have considered the courage of Lindsey, who remains so bright and engaging while being his full-time carer, a part-time physiotherapist as well as a mum to their three children under the age of 10. We have discussed the possible links between MND and the 30 concussions Burrow suffered during his career and relived the adversity he overcame as a scrum-half who, standing 5ft 4in and weighing under 10 stone, had to outwit and tackle opponents sometimes double his weight and over a foot taller than him.</p><p>以一种类似的方式，我们考虑了Lindsey的勇气，他仍然如此明亮和参与，同时成为他的全职照顾者，兼职的物理治疗师以及少女到10岁以下的孩子。我们已经讨论过MND和30次脑震荡之间的可能链接在他的职业生涯中遭受遭受遭受的痛苦，并将他克服的逆境作为一个克拉姆 - 半，留下5英尺4英寸和10米下的石头，不得不脱颖而出，有时略高于他的体重和脚更高比他。</p><p> I also receive longer and more textured responses from Rob when Lindsey emails his answers. “I have changed my opinion about living in the moment,” he writes one evening. “Since my diagnosis I see the moment as it is and find meaning in it. When the kids are playing in the garden or purely having fun, it makes me appreciate the moment. One day, before I know it, I won’t be able to enjoy these timeless moments. When I tell Lindsey and the kids I love them, you never know how far you are from telling them that for the last time.”</p><p> 当Lindsey通过电子邮件发送他的答案时，我也收到了更长且更纹理的响应。 “我在此刻改变了我对生活的看法，”他一天晚上写道。 “由于我的诊断，我看到了它的那一刻，并且找到它的意义。当孩子们在花园里玩耍或纯粹获得乐趣时，这让我很欣赏这一刻。有一天，在我知道之前，我将无法享受这些永恒的时刻。当我告诉Lindsey和我爱他们的孩子时，你永远不会知道你是最后一次告诉他们的距离。“</p><p> Rob’s voice fills the room again now. “I appreciate the simple things. I don’t have a bucket list because I’ve had such a wonderful life. However, I want to make the most of the time I have left.”</p><p> Rob的声音现在再次填满了房间。 “我很欣赏简单的事情。我没有桶名单，因为我有这么美好的生活。但是，我想充分利用我离开的时间。“</p><p> Days after the diagnosis, a distraught Lindsey started crying at a cash machine when she couldn’t remember her pin number. Rob urged her to live in the moment and savour every day they had left together. If Lindsey felt down he would join her in a slump of depression. But if they both considered how lucky they had been for so long, it would be easier to make the most of the time they could still share.</p><p> 诊断后的几天，当她不记得她的密码时，一个心烦意乱的林女开始在自动取款机上哭泣。抢劫敦促她生活在当下，每天都留下来撒谎。如果Lindsey感到沮丧，他会加入她的萧条。但如果他们都考虑了他们已经幸运的幸运，那么充分利用他们仍然可以分享的时间更容易。</p><p> I’m in more of a carer’s role now. But I still love every minute we have together</p><p> 我现在更多的是护理人员的角色。但我仍然喜欢我们一起的每一分钟</p><p> Rob also introduced a no-tears policy as an affirmation of everything good that remained in their changed lives. He told Lindsey that, while he accepted the hard truth of the diagnosis, he would fight the prognosis and try to live for longer than the doctors predicted.</p><p> Rob还介绍了一个没有泪水政策，作为对他们改变生活中的一切良好的肯定。他告诉Lindsey，虽然他接受了诊断的艰难真理，但他会打败预后并尝试生活超过医生的预测。</p><p> “That sums up Rob’s mentality,” Lindsey says. “He was a tower of strength and I thought: ‘If Rob can be positive about this, we’ll make the best of it.’ I also remembered my line manager at work telling me she had lost a family member through a heart attack and they hadn’t had time to say everything they wanted to say or to make more memories together. We do that here every day.”</p><p> “这总结了Rob的心态，”Lindsey说。 “他是一个力量塔，我想：'如果抢劫可以是积极的，我们将充分利用它。”我也记得我的线路经理在工作中告诉我她已经通过心脏病发作了一个家庭成员他们没有时间说出他们想说的一切或者更多的回忆。我们每天都在这里。“ </p><p> Earlier this afternoon, on a miserable bank holiday in Yorkshire, Lindsey had helped Rob into the car so they could take the kids swimming. “I loved it,” Rob tells me. “Just to see the kids having fun and a bit of normality made it feel like it used to be.”</p><p>今天下午早些时候，在约克郡的一个悲惨的银行假期，Lindsey帮助抢劫车，所以他们可以带孩子游泳。 “我喜欢它，”Rob告诉我。 “只是为了看到有趣的孩子们，有点常态让它曾经常常这样做。”</p><p> Lindsey seems to do the work of three people during every long day which starts for her at 5.30am and ends near midnight. But, as she explains, “It keeps your mind off things. When I sit down on the bad days and think: ‘Actually this is happening, this is our life,’ it hits you. But the kids keep us busy and there’s never a dull moment, is there, Rob? I’d much rather that than feeling sorry for myself.</p><p> Lindsey似乎在每年漫长的一天完成三个人的工作，从5中午5点30分开始，在午夜附近结束。但是，正如她解释的那样，“它让你的思绪脱离了。当我坐在糟糕的日子里，思考：'实际上是这样，这是我们的生活，'它击中了你。但是孩子们让我们忙碌，从来没有一个沉闷的时刻，就在那里，抢劫吗？我宁愿对自己感到难过。</p><p> “There are days when you think: ‘Why me?’ But then I think of Rob and that really puts it into perspective because I’m able to physically do what I want. I can still go to the gym on my own for an hour at 6 am, I can play with the kids, I can do my work as a physio while being Rob’s carer. I look at Rob and think: ‘What have I got to moan about when he stays so positive?’ What I have to do is nothing compared to what Rob goes through on a daily basis.</p><p> “有几天你想：'为什么我？'但是我想到了抢劫，这真的把它放在了角度，因为我能够在身体上做我想做的事。我仍然可以在早上6点到达一小时的时间，我可以和孩子一起玩，我可以在被抢劫的照顾者上做我的工作。我看起来抢劫并思考：'当他保持这种情况时，我呻吟了什么？“与每天抢劫进行的，我所要做的就是没有。</p><p> “Rob is such a wonderful man and I am the person I am because of him. So the good absolutely outweighs the bad. Looking back we had everything. We had three beautiful, healthy children, good jobs and nice holidays. Life was perfect. But what happened doesn’t change my love towards Rob or how I feel about him. It just puts me in a different role. I’m in more of a carer’s role now. But I still love every minute we have together.</p><p> “抢劫是一个如此美妙的男人，我是我是我的人。所以绝对胜过糟糕。回头看我们拥有一切。我们有三个美丽，健康的孩子，良好的工作和愉快的假期。生活是完美的。但是发生了什么，不会改变我对抢劫的爱或我对他的感受。它只是让我有不同的作用。我现在更多的是护理人员的角色。但我仍然喜欢我们一起的每一分钟。</p><p> “Not so long ago I asked Rob: ‘If you could go back and we were told that rugby had a part to play in you getting MND, would you change anything?’ He said absolutely not. That was really reassuring for me because I knew Rob was in a good place and, despite his struggles, he didn’t have any regrets.”</p><p> “不久前我问罗伯：'如果你能回去，我们被告知我们被告知，橄榄球有一个部分在你得到mnd，你会改变什么吗？”他绝对没说。这对我来说真的很令人放心，因为我认识抢劫是一个好地方，尽管他挣扎，但他没有遗憾。“</p><p>  I ask Rob if he still likes to watch rugby league? “I enjoy watching the Rhinos on TV but I sometimes wonder: ‘How the heck did I compete for so long?’ But I don’t criticise them because everyone can see a gap on the TV but I know how hard it is to do with a split-second on the field. It makes me wonder, in my current situation, how I ever could do it. But it is all so insignificant now.”</p><p>  如果他还喜欢看橄榄球联盟，我会问抢劫吗？ “我喜欢在电视上看犀牛，但我有时会想到：'哎呀我怎么竞争这么久？”但我不批评他们，因为每个人都可以看到电视上的差距，但我知道它有多努力在场上分裂。在我目前的情况下，它让我想知道，我曾经做过。但现在一切都很微不足道。“</p><p> How would they feel if their little boy Jackson, who is not quite three, plays rugby one day? As Rob types, Lindsey says: “He’s more interested in kicking a football at the moment but I think he’s got Rob’s sporting genes. I would probably say no, just because it was bad enough seeing Rob play and there’s always the question at the back of my mind: ‘Is [MND] sport-related?’ I remember seeing how much Rob’s mum and dad worried when he was playing. I’ll support the children whatever they do but it wouldn’t bother me if Jackson was a ballet dancer.”</p><p> 他们觉得如果他们的小男孩杰克逊，那不是三个，他们有一天扮演橄榄球？作为ROB类型，Lindsey说：“他对当时的踢足球更感兴趣，但我认为他有罗伯的体育基因。我可能会说不，只是因为它足够糟糕，看到抢劫玩耍，我脑海的背后总是有问题：'是[MND]与运动相关的？'我记得看到他是多少罗伯的妈妈和爸爸担心玩。如果杰克逊是芭蕾舞演员，我会支持孩子的支持，但如果杰克逊是一个芭蕾舞演员，那就不会打扰我。“ </p><p> Rob’s doctors have stressed that more scientific research needs to be done to establish whether there are proven links between rugby-induced concussion and MND. Lindsey has medical knowledge and she has worked with MND patients for years. Does her gut tell her there is a connection? “It’s really difficult. There are many people who have never played sport who get the disease. But maybe there is a link. That’s why it’s vital we get more research done. Rob puts it down to bad luck. He had a wonderful career and he loved playing rugby. I know all the great benefits of sport so I wouldn’t want to put anybody off playing.</p><p>Rob的医生强调，需要进行更科学的研究，以确定橄榄球诱发脑震荡和MND之间是否有经过验证的联系。 Lindsey有医学知识，她曾与MND患者合作多年。她的肠道告诉她有一个联系吗？ “这很困难。有很多人从未播放过疾病的运动。但也许有一个链接。这就是为什么我们在完成更多研究方面是至关重要的。罗布把它放在运气不好。他有一个美好的职业生涯，他喜欢玩橄榄球。我知道运动的所有良好好处，所以我不想把任何人放在场。</p><p> “But I always worried about the long-term effects of concussion. He played games and he was not able to remember scoring tries or he didn’t know the score afterwards. So I worried about Rob getting some form of dementia or Alzheimer’s – which is irrelevant now.”</p><p> “但我总是担心脑震荡的长期影响。他播放比赛，他无法记得得分尝试或之后不知道得分。所以我担心抢夺一些形式的痴呆症或阿尔茨海默氏症 - 现在无关紧要。“</p><p> Rob has finished typing. His voice echoes around us: “I would love Jackson to play and I’d support him whatever path he chose.”</p><p> ROB完成了键入。他周围的声音回声：“我会爱杰克逊玩，我会支持他选择的任何道路。”</p><p>   One of his autobiography’s central themes is how Rob was doubted for so long by people who thought he was far too small to make it in rugby league. Of course, in later years, his speed, intelligence and bravery made such doubts redundant. “I played to my strengths,” Rob explains. “I had speed and agility. I didn’t try to be anything I wasn’t. I never had any doubts. I’m tougher than I look.”</p><p>   他的自传的中央主题之一是罗布对那些以为他太小而无法在橄榄球联盟中制作它的人来说。当然，在后来的几年里，他的速度，智慧和勇敢使这种疑惑冗余。 “我扮演了我的优势，”抢劫解释道。 “我有速度和敏捷性。我没有尝试成为我不做的任何事情。我从未有任何疑问。我比我看起来更强硬。“</p><p> I imagine the droll way Rob might have delivered that line 18 months ago. But was he scared on the field? While Rob begins typing, as if diligently doing his homework, I ask Lindsey if she felt fear watching him play. “Definitely. Rob’s small stature made me worry and, being a physiotherapist, I understood the injuries. I was always relieved after a game when he was still in one piece, a bit battered and bruised.</p><p> 我想象18个月前可能已经交付了那条线。但他害怕在这个领域吗？抢劫开始打字，仿佛孜孜不倦地做作业，如果她觉得恐惧看着他玩耍，我会问Lindsey。 “确实。 Rob的小身材让我担心，是一个物理治疗师，我理解受伤。当他仍然在一件碎片时，我总是在比赛之后放心，有点殴打和伤痕累累。</p><p>  “Seeing him knocked out in a World Cup game shook me. Just seeing him on the floor, almost looking lifeless, was hard. And remember, Rob, when you broke your collarbone? You walked off the pitch but it was difficult. Rob was always so tough and it never fazed him. You need that mentality when you’re up against players twice your size. Rob was fearless but I know the impact his body took over the years.”</p><p>  “看到他在世界杯游戏中击败了我。只是在地板上看到他，几乎没有生气，很难。记住，抢劫，当你打破你的锁骨？你走了散步，但很难。 Rob总是那么强硬，它从未冒犯他。当你反对你的尺寸两倍时，你需要这种心态。罗布是无所畏惧的，但我知道他的身体多年来的影响。“</p><p> Rob’s answer is ready. “I was afraid of failing,” he says, “but never scared of playing.”</p><p> ROB的答案已准备好。 “我害怕失败，”他说，“但从不害怕玩耍。” </p><p> We become nostalgic when I ask Rob which game he would watch again if he could relive only one last match. “ The 2011 Grand Final. I can’t believe what I did.”</p><p>当我要求抢劫哪个游戏时，他会再次观看，如果他只能重温最后一个比赛，他会变得怀旧。 “2011年的大决赛。我无法相信我做了什么。“</p><p> In another testing final against St Helens, Burrow receives a pass just over the halfway line at Old Trafford.  Instinctive brilliance bursts out of him as he steps off his left foot and arrows towards one of the big Saints forwards before zipping around him. He avoids another heavy tackle, sidesteps Saints’ full-back Paul Wellens, putting him on his backside, and skips past an attempted tap-tackle. Four defenders close on him from various angles but Burrow flies to the line and dives over for one of the great Grand Final tries.</p><p> 在另一个对St Helens的决赛中，洞穴在老特拉福德的中途接收了一条传球。本能的华晨在他左脚朝向他的左脚箭头朝向他的左脚前进之前迸发出来。他避开了另一个沉重的铲球，Sideesteps Saints'的全背部保罗沃伦，把他放在他的背面，并跳过一个尝试的Tap-tackle。四个捍卫者从各种角度接近他，但洞穴飞到了线上，潜入了一个伟大的盛大决赛之一。</p><p> Leeds took the low road to a fourth Grand Final victory over  St Helens in five years, with the tiny scrum-half Rob Burrow providing the decisive contributions in this land of the giants.</p><p> 利兹在五年内占据了St ST Helens的第四次盛大的胜利之路，微小的Scrum-Half Rob Burrow在巨人的这片土地上提供了决定性的贡献。</p><p> Burrow, who had already won the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man of the match in the first of the Rhinos&#39; previous Old Trafford victories over Saints in 2007, scored a brilliant individual try in the first half, then laid on the match-winner late in the second for Ryan Hall with another thrilling scamper.</p><p> 洞穴，已经赢得了哈里桑德兰奖杯作为犀牛＆＃39的比赛的人;以前的老特拉福德在2007年的圣徒的胜利，在上半场取得了一个辉煌的个人，然后在莱安大厅举行的比赛冠军队的赛车队的另一个令人兴奋的诈骗。</p><p> Burrow and Kevin Sinfield, the Leeds captain who lifted the Super League trophy for the fifth time since 2004, had both said &#34;It&#39;s not how you start, it&#39;s how you finish&#34; before they even left the pitch.</p><p> Burrow和Kevin Sinfield，LEEDS船长为自2004年以来第五次举起了超级联赛奖杯，曾经说过＆＃34;它不是你的开始，它和＃39;你如何完成和＃34;在他们甚至离开球场之前。</p><p> &#34;What a night, what a season we&#39;ve had,&#34; added Sinfield, who kicked six goals from seven attempts but was happy to be completely overshadowed by the 5ft 5in Burrow. The 29-year-old has endured a testing year even by the standards of his Leeds team-mates, having lost his place as the starting scrum-half and been forced to adapt to a new role as an impact player off the interchange bench.</p><p> ＆＃34;什么晚上，我们有什么季节＆＃39; vere，＆＃34;从七次尝试中踢了六个目标的辛菲尔德，但很乐意被5英尺5英尺5英尺的洞穴完全黯然失色。这位29岁的孩子甚至遭到了一个测试年度，即使是他的利兹队队友的标准，也失去了他的位置，作为起始scrum-ale，被迫适应交换台上的影响球员。</p><p> &#34;That doesn&#39;t matter on a night like this,&#34; he grinned, peeping his head over the dais in the Old Trafford lecture theatre where Sir Alex Ferguson occasionally addresses his public. &#34;Everybody would rather start a match than be on the bench, but you do whatever is best for the team.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这不像这样的夜晚，＆＃34;他咧嘴一笑，偷了他在老特拉福德讲座的傣族的头上，亚历克斯·弗格森爵士偶尔地解决了他的公众。 ＆＃34;每个人都宁愿开始比在长凳上的比赛，但是你做了最适合团队的任何事情。＆＃34; </p><p> &#34;That answer sums up some of the reasons behind the success of this club,&#34; said Brian McDermott, the imposing Leeds coach. &#34;Rob obviously wants to start games, but he&#39;s shown humility and integrity to do things for the benefit of the team. That&#39;s an example of the culture of the club.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;这回答了这个俱乐部成功背后的一些原因，＆＃34; Brian McDermott说，施工利兹教练。 ＆＃34;抢劫显然想要开始游戏，但他＆＃39; S表现出谦虚和诚信，为团队的利益做事。那个俱乐部文化的例子。＆＃34;</p><p> The teams were locked at 2-2 after an attritional opening half-hour in the steady Mancunian rain when Burrow broke the deadlock with one of the most spectacular tries in the Grand Final&#39;s 14-year history.</p><p> 当洞穴突破僵局在稳定的曼西安雨中突破了僵局时，这支球队被锁定在2-2岁后。在大决赛中最壮观的尝试之一，洞穴突破了僵局。</p><p> He collected a pass just inside the Saints half, ran deliberately at two of their biggest forwards and ducked his small frame beneath a couple of bulging biceps. He left Wellens floundering with a classic sidestep and held off a couple more desperate cover defenders to slide over next to the posts. Sinfield added a simple goal, and the Rhinos had poached an 8-2 lead.</p><p> 他在圣徒里面的一半里收集了一盏通道，故意在他们最大的两头前进，并在几个膨胀的二头肌下躲避他的小框架。他留下了与经典的索迪斯群体挣扎，并举行了一对更加绝望的封面防守者，在帖子旁边滑过。 Sinfield增加了一个简单的目标，犀牛偷猎了8-2铅。</p><p> He is engulfed by his ecstatic teammates. It is one of the sweetest moments of his life and the adulation the other players shower on their little scrum-half has underpinned their love since they understood he was dying. His captain that day was, as usual,  Kevin Sinfield.</p><p> 他被他的狂欢队友吞没了。它是他生命中最甜蜜的时刻之一，而且曲线上的曲线淋浴到他们的小克拉姆半的阵雨，因为他们理解他正在垂死以来，他们的爱是顽皮的。那天他的船长是常见的，凯文·辛菲尔德。</p><p> When Sinfield ran seven marathons in seven days last December, on behalf of the Burrow family and the fight against MND, Rob said: “We all need a friend like Kevin.”</p><p> 当前12月七天九天的七天马拉松，代表洞穴家族和对阵MND的斗争，罗伯士说：“我们都需要像凯文这样的朋友。”</p><p> I tell Rob how,  when I interviewed Sinfield a week after his seventh marathon, I was impressed all over again. If it was down to me, I joke, I would sack Sinfield from his position as director of rugby at Leeds Rhinos and make him prime minister. “He’d do a better job than Bo-Jo,” Burrow replies, the laugh muffled inside him.</p><p> 我告诉罗布，当我在他的第七次马拉松后一周接受了Sinfield时，我会再次印象深刻。如果它对我来说，我开玩笑，我会把罪魁场从他的职务中解雇，作为橄榄球的主任，在利兹犀牛，使他成为总理。 “他比Bo-jo更好，”伯罗克回答，笑声在他内心消失了。</p><p>  That depth of friendship, which he has with so many of his former teammates, means Rob is relieved he resisted offers to leave Leeds. He remained a one-club man right until the end for he was an academy coach when the disease changed his life. “I am so glad I did not move. I would have been disappointed with myself because look at the way the club helped me through the disease.”</p><p>  这种友谊的深度，他有这么多队友，意味着Rob被解除了他抵制的供应离开利兹。当疾病改变他的生命时，他仍然是一个单俱乐部男子直到他是一名学院教练。 “我很高兴我没有动。我本来对自己感到失望，因为看着俱乐部帮助我的疾病的方式。“ </p><p> Even when I remember the shimmering blue streak of Burrow in that 2011 Grand Final, and contrast it silently with the motionless man in the damaged shell of his body, Rob and Lindsey offer a fresh perspective. Lindsey tells me about Dr Agam Jung, the neurologist at the Leeds Clinic which helps him. In Rob’s book, Dr Jung explains that her MND patients want “to find peace in their heads”. She says their acceptance of death means that “our clinic is not morbid or morose. It’s a happy place.”</p><p>即使我记得2011年大决赛中的洞穴的闪闪发光的蓝色条纹，并与他的身体损坏的壳体中的动态男子默默地搞定，抢劫和林赛提供了新的观点。 Lindsey告诉我Leeds Clinic神经科学家Agam Jung博士，帮助他。在Rob的书中，Jung博士解释说，她的MND患者希望“在他们的头脑中找到和平”。她说他们接受死亡意味着“我们的诊所不是病态或莫罗斯。这是一个快乐的地方。“</p><p> I only hope that there are ghosts so I can watch my family grow up and still protect them</p><p> 我只希望有鬼，所以我可以看着我的家人长大，仍然保护它们</p><p> Dr Jung says Rob is a favourite patient because of his positivity and spirit, and also because he has done so much to raise awareness of MND. People come to her clinic and say they think they have “Rob Burrow’s Disease”. It echoes how, for many decades in the US, MND was called “Lou Gehrig’s Disease” – after the great baseball player who was struck down in 1939.</p><p> Jung博士说，由于他的积极和精神，Rob是一个最喜欢的患者，也因为他为提高了对MND的认识。人们来到她的诊所，并说他们认为他们有“罗布罗疾病”。它呼应了在美国的数十年中，MND被称为“Lou Gehrig的疾病” - 在1939年被击中的伟大棒球运动员之后。</p><p> Rob also helped Dr Jung in a way he did not understand at first. His sporting profile meant she was invited to speak on television about Rob and MND. It was almost as if her new platform boosted her in the eyes of previously sceptical colleagues. Her ethnicity, and the fact she was a woman, finally mattered less than her deep expertise in MND.</p><p> Rob也帮助Jung博士，他起初他不明白。他的体育档案意味着她被邀请在有关Rob和Mnd的电视上发言。几乎就好像她的新平台在以前怀疑的同事的眼中提升了她。她的种族，以及她是一个女人的事实，终于略低于她在MND中的深刻专业知识。</p><p> “Having listened to Dr Jung explain how much it meant to her,” Rob says, “I completely empathise. I think about a stereotypical doctor on TV and I struggle to remember how many women are put in front of a camera. It makes me feel privileged for it to mean so much to her.”</p><p> “听到了Jung博士解释了它对她的意思，”罗伯说，“我完全同情。我想到了一个关于电视上的陈规定型医生，我努力记住镜头前有多少女性。这让我感到幸福，这对她来说意义重大。“</p><p>  A dark rain falls outside but there is still so much light here. “There are times when I think about death,” Rob admits, “but I’m not afraid of dying. I only hope that there are ghosts so I can watch my family grow up and still protect them. Although I won’t be there in body I will never leave their side in spirit.”</p><p>  一个黑暗的雨落在外面，但这里仍然有这么多的光芒。 “有时候我考虑死亡时，”抢劫承认“，但我不怕死。我只希望有鬼魂，所以我可以看着我的家人长大，仍然保护它们。虽然我不会在身体中，但我永远不会留下他们的精神。“</p><p> Lindsey will soon settle Rob into his special hospital bed, which can be raised, as it is hard for him to lie on his back. I imagine their darkened house and both of them trying to find sleep at the end of another draining day. A tug of sadness soon lifts as I remember what sustains them.</p><p> Lindsey很快就会解决他的特殊医院床，这可以提出，因为他很难躺在他的背上。我想起他们黑暗的房子，两者都试图在另一个排水日结束时发现睡眠。一定悲伤的悲伤很快升降，因为我记得他们维持了什么。 </p><p> “There’s something beautiful,” Rob says, “about being cared for by the only girl you’ve ever loved.”</p><p>“有一些美丽的东西，”罗伯斯说，“关于被你所爱的唯一一个女孩照顾。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/07/rob-and-lindsey-burrow">https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/07/rob-and-lindsey-burrow</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/充分利用/">#充分利用</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/wonderful/">#wonderful</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/抢劫/">#抢劫</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
