Now, the  SoftBank Group    9984  -2.47%  founder is sitting on  one of the largest cash piles in the investing world.</p><p>今年春末，日本科技业亿万富翁孙正义(Masayoshi Son)表示，他曾在金融崩溃的悬崖边“窥视”。如今，这位软银集团(SoftBank Group)创始人坐拥全球最大的现金储备之一。</p><p>  Mr. Son pulled his conglomerate back from the void with a sharp and surprising strategy shift,  selling off holdings that have been central to his investment and operating blueprint, and buying back shares. The world’s biggest tech investor relinquished majority control over its last major operating businesses, sealing SoftBank’s transformation into an investment firm—and Mr. Son’s reputation for not doing anything by halves.</p><p>孙正义做出了令人意外的重大战略转变，将他的企业集团从虚无中拉了回来，出售了对他的投资和运营蓝图至关重要的股份，并回购了股票。这家世界上最大的科技投资者放弃了对其最后几项主要运营业务的多数控制权，从而封杀了软银向投资公司的转型--以及孙正义什么都不做半途而废的名声。</p><p>  Mr. Son  had survived previous corporate near-death episodes. This time, there was a new force urging on the metamorphosis.</p><p>孙正义在之前的企业濒死事件中幸存了下来。这一次，有一股新的力量在催生蜕变。</p><p>  When SoftBank’s shares lost nearly half their value—almost $50 billion—in two weeks this spring, Mr. Son and his senior team held daily calls with executives at hedge-fund firm Elliott Management Corp., said people familiar with the discussions.  Elliott since last fall has built a SoftBank stake that likely makes it the company’s No. 2 shareholder after Mr. Son, they said.</p><p>知情人士说，今年春天，当软银股价在两周内缩水近一半(近500亿美元)时，孙正义和他的高层团队每天都会与对冲基金公司埃利奥特管理公司(Elliott Management Corp.)的高管举行电话会议。他们说，埃利奥特自去年秋天以来一直在增持软银股份，这可能使其成为该公司仅次于孙正义的第二大股东。</p><p>  Among Elliott executives counseling the Japanese firm was Gordon Singer, the founder’s 46-year-old son and head of Elliott’s London office. Mr. Singer and his team pressed Mr. Son to improve corporate governance and buy back shares.</p><p>为这家日本公司提供咨询的埃利奥特高管包括创始人46岁的儿子、埃利奥特伦敦办事处负责人戈登·辛格(Gordon Singer)。辛格和他的团队敦促孙正义改善公司治理并回购股票。</p><p>    In the end, SoftBank bought back more stock than Elliott had pressed for—surprising executives at the hedge fund—and sold enough assets to leave the company as much as $60 billion in available cash, said a person with knowledge of SoftBank’s finances.</p><p>一位了解软银财务状况的人士表示，最终，软银回购了比埃利奥特要求的更多的股票--这让这家对冲基金的高管感到意外--并出售了足够多的资产，让公司获得了高达600亿美元的可用现金。</p><p>  SoftBank shares closed at 6,581 yen on Wednesday, up 144% from their March 19 nadir.</p><p>软银股价周三收于6,581日圆，较3月19日的最低点上涨144%。</p><p>  Now there is a nagging question within Elliott: Might Mr. Son go back to his old ways?</p><p>现在，埃利奥特心中有一个挥之不去的问题：孙正义会不会重操旧业？</p><p>  Some inside the hedge-fund firm are wary  Mr. Son could spend the cash on risky investments, as he has done before, said people familiar with Elliott. He has often paid a major premium that has baffled the investment and tech worlds, including a large investment in office-share firm  WeWork that he later called “really bad” judgment and another on a dog-walking startup.</p><p>熟悉埃利奥特的人士说，这家对冲基金公司的一些内部人士担心，孙正义可能会像以前那样把现金花在高风险投资上。他经常支付令投资界和科技界困惑的巨额溢价，包括对写字楼共享公司WeWork的一笔大笔投资，他后来称这笔投资的判断“非常糟糕”，还有一笔投资是对一家遛狗创业公司的投资。</p><p>  Those worries have been fanned recently by Mr. Son’s surprise move to become essentially a day-trader, personally directing a team of traders using some of the cash pile to bet on daily moves in tech stocks.</p><p>孙正义最近出人意料地成为一名日间交易员，亲自指挥一个交易员团队用部分现金押注科技股的每日走势，加剧了这些担忧。</p><p>  Elliott executives are concerned enough about Mr. Son’s new activity that they have hedged against some of his trades by buying put options on an index of tech stocks, said the people familiar with Elliott. SoftBank is keeping all options open for spending the cash, Mr. Son said at an earnings press conference on Monday.</p><p>熟悉埃利奥特的人士说，埃利奥特的高管非常担心孙正义的新活动，他们通过购买科技股指数的看跌期权来对冲孙正义的部分交易。孙正义在周一的财报新闻发布会上说，软银将保留使用这笔现金的所有选择。</p><p>    The year 2020 has further cemented Mr. Son’s reputation as one of the world’s most unpredictable entrepreneurs, one whose every move is scrutinized, given how his cash sways industries and markets.</p><p>2020年进一步巩固了孙正义作为世界上最不可预测的企业家之一的声誉，考虑到他的现金对行业和市场的影响，他的一举一动都受到了密切关注。</p><p>  That Elliott, one of the world’s most tenacious activist investors, is wary SoftBank could head in an unanticipated direction is testament to Mr. Son’s record. He is known for strokes of investing genius, for huge flops and for running his own show, sometimes arguing against his own board and advisers.</p><p>埃利奥特是世界上最顽强的维权投资者之一，他对软银可能会走向意想不到的方向持谨慎态度，这证明了孙正义的记录。他以投资天才的笔触、巨大的失败以及经营自己的公司而闻名，有时还会与自己的董事会和顾问发生争执。</p><p>  In a written statement, SoftBank said that while its “vision hasn’t changed, our business model is always evolving,” adding that it is focused on pursuing an artificial-intelligence revolution and “creating value for shareholders—and no one is more determined to deliver than Mr. Son.”</p><p>软银在一份书面声明中说，虽然它的“愿景没有改变，但我们的商业模式一直在发展”，并补充说，它专注于追求人工智能革命，并“为股东创造价值--没有人比孙正义更有决心实现这一目标。”</p><p>  SoftBank’s strategy shift and its asset sales were based solely on its own judgment, the company said. Investment decisions at SoftBank or the Vision Fund are made by their boards or investment committees, not by Mr. Son on his own, it said, declining to make Mr. Son available for an interview. Elliott declined to make Mr. Singer available for an interview.</p><p>该公司表示，软银的战略转变和资产出售完全是基于自己的判断。报道称，软银或远景基金的投资决策是由董事会或投资委员会做出的，而不是孙正义自己做出的，但拒绝让孙正义接受采访。埃利奥特拒绝让辛格接受采访。</p><p>   Elliott’s deepening foray into SoftBank harks back to last summer, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the companies, investors in the firms, and traders and bankers who work with them.</p><p>据对软银有第一手了解的人士、软银的投资者以及与软银共事的交易员和银行家说，埃利奥特对软银的深入攻势可以追溯到去年夏天。</p><p>  SoftBank is Elliott’s largest-ever bet on a single stock, said people familiar with the investment. Since it began building its stake last fall, Elliott’s SoftBank position has grown in recent months to at least $5 billion, much of it via so-called swaps that let Elliott avoid disclosing the full extent of its SoftBank position, they said. At today’s prices, that would be the equivalent of a 3.8% stake. It has since sold some shares, the people said.</p><p>知情人士称，软银是埃利奥特有史以来对单一股票的最大押注。他们说，自从去年秋天开始增持以来，埃利奥特的软银头寸近几个月已增至至少50亿美元，其中很大一部分是通过所谓的掉期交易实现的，这些掉期交易让埃利奥特得以避免披露其所持软银头寸的全部情况。以今天的价格计算，这相当于持有3.8%的股份。知情人士说，自那以来，该公司已经出售了一些股票。</p><p>  Elliott is an odd match for Mr. Son. Founded by billionaire Paul Singer in 1977, the $41 billion fund is famous for taking stakes in companies and engaging in pitched battles with management. Chief executives who go head-to-head with Elliott frequently lose. It is known for its disciplined focus on not losing money—the founder has described that as the firm’s No. 1 rule.</p><p>对于孙正义来说，埃利奥特是一个奇怪的对手。这只410亿美元的基金由亿万富翁保罗·辛格(Paul Singer)于1977年创立，以入股公司并与管理层展开激烈斗争而闻名。与埃利奥特针锋相对的首席执行官们经常输掉比赛。该公司以严谨地专注于不亏损而闻名--创始人称这是公司的头号规则。</p><p>    In 2008, when hedge funds on average lost 19%, Elliott lost 3%. It was up 8.7% this year through September.</p><p>2008年，当对冲基金平均亏损19%时，埃利奥特亏损了3%。截至今年9月，该指数上涨了8.7%。</p><p>  Mr. Son has become the world’s biggest technology investor by relying on his gut. He has directed SoftBank into dozens of companies often based, he has said, on instinct and a vision of how technology will change the future. He expects to lose money on some investments. Like most venture capitalists, his hope is that a handful will eventually be hits. He has said he invests with the aim to make SoftBank last 300 years.</p><p>凭借自己的勇气，孙正义已经成为世界上最大的科技投资者。他曾指导软银进入数十家公司，他说，这些公司往往是基于技术将如何改变未来的直觉和愿景。他预计一些投资会赔钱。像大多数风险资本家一样，他希望少数人最终会受到打击。他曾表示，他投资的目标是让软银持续300年。</p><p>  SoftBank is known for its chaotic culture, reflecting its founder’s personality. Mr. Son often calls hourslong discussion sessions over strategy or investments, company veterans say, and sometimes pushes through investments despite skepticism from banks, his executives or his own board. He has said he can quickly sense whether he wants to invest in an entrepreneur, famously saying he decided to offer funding to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma because of the twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>软银以其混乱的文化而闻名，这反映了其创始人的个性。公司资深人士说，孙正义经常召开长达一个小时的战略或投资讨论会，有时会不顾银行、高管或董事会的质疑，推动投资。他曾说过，他很快就能感觉到自己是否想要投资一位企业家。他曾说过一句名言，他决定向阿里巴巴集团(Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.)联合创始人马云提供资金，因为他的眼睛里闪烁着光芒。</p><p>  Over the nearly 40 years since founding SoftBank, Mr. Son has steered it through a bewildering number of businesses, from software distribution to mobile phones to satellites and  solar arrays. During the dot-com boom and bust, he gained and lost the status of world’s richest man and made one of the world’s great venture-capital bets, a $100 million Alibaba investment that is still valued at more than $170 billion even after selling portions of it.</p><p>自创立软银以来的近40年里，孙正义带领软银开展了多项令人眼花缭乱的业务，从软件分销到手机，再到卫星和太阳能电池板。在互联网繁荣和萧条期间，他获得和失去了世界首富的地位，并进行了世界上最伟大的风险投资之一--对阿里巴巴的1亿美元投资，即使在出售了部分投资后，这笔投资的价值仍超过1700亿美元。</p><p>  He hasn’t replicated that success with his most recent venture, the $100 billion Vision Fund. It logged an investment loss of $17 billion in the year ended March 31, and efforts to find investors for a sequel fund flopped. Those two funds posted a $13 billion investment gain for the six months through September, SoftBank said Monday.</p><p>他最近成立的1000亿美元远景基金(Vision Fund)没有复制这种成功。在截至3月31日的财年中，软银录得170亿美元的投资亏损，为续集基金寻找投资者的努力也以失败告终。软银周一表示，这两只基金在截至9月份的六个月里获得了130亿美元的投资收益。</p><p>  SoftBank said its “culture is one where importance is placed on maintaining momentum to always stay ahead of the times. It is not ‘chaotic.’ ”</p><p>软银表示，它的“文化是一种重视保持势头、始终走在时代前列的文化。”这不是‘混乱’。“</p><p>   Elliott had traded modestly in SoftBank stock for more than a decade, but never felt comfortable making a big activist bet, said people familiar with its strategy. They were worried Mr. Son, who holds nearly 30% of the company, wouldn’t agree to take steps Elliott could normally demand of its targets, such as selling assets or making substantial share buybacks.</p><p>熟悉埃利奥特策略的人士表示，十多年来，埃利奥特一直在适度交易软银股票，但在维权人士身上下大赌注从来都不舒服。他们担心持有该公司近30%股份的孙正义不会同意采取埃利奥特通常要求其收购目标的措施，比如出售资产或进行大规模股票回购。</p><p>    Last year, the idea of taking a larger SoftBank stake attracted Elliott’s Mr. Singer, the founder’s son, who saw it was trading far below the value of assets it was holding. He thought aggressive share buybacks could help close that gap, and figured  the WeWork debacle—it scrapped its initial public offering plan,  pushed out its founder and was bailed out by SoftBank—might have humbled Mr. Son enough to be willing to hear them out.</p><p>去年，收购软银更多股份的想法吸引了埃利奥特创始人之子辛格，他认为软银的股价远远低于其持有的资产价值。他认为，积极的股票回购可能有助于缩小这一差距，并认为WeWork的失败--该公司放弃了首次公开募股(IPO)计划，将创始人赶下台，并接受了软银(SoftBank)的救助--可能已经让孙正义变得谦逊到愿意听他们说完。</p><p>  SoftBank’s stock has long traded for less than the sum of its parts because investors are wary about Mr. Son’s unorthodox investment style. In addition to its stake in Alibaba and the Vision Fund, last year SoftBank owned controlling interests in U.S. telecom operator Sprint, a Japanese mobile operator and Arm Holdings, a microchip design company. At year’s end, SoftBank shares were trading at less than 50% of the value of its assets.</p><p>由于投资者对孙正义的非正统投资风格持谨慎态度，软银的股价长期以来一直低于其各部分的总和。除了在阿里巴巴和远景基金的股份，软银去年还拥有美国电信运营商Sprint和微芯片设计公司ARM Holdings的控股权。年底时，软银的股价还不到其资产价值的50%。</p><p>  Elliott took a small position in SoftBank in the fall and began adding to it. By February 2020,  Elliott had amassed a more than $2.5 billion stake in SoftBank, equivalent at the time to about 3% of SoftBank’s market value.</p><p>去年秋天，埃利奥特在软银(SoftBank)获得了一个小头寸，并开始增持。到2020年2月，埃利奥特已经积累了超过25亿美元的软银股份，相当于当时软银市值的3%左右。</p><p>  What do you think Masayoshi Son will spend SoftBank’s billions in cash on next? Join the conversation below.</p><p>你认为孙正义下一步会把软银数十亿美元的现金花在什么地方？加入下面的对话。</p><p>  Instead of launching a public campaign and surprising SoftBank with its demands, as Elliott has done with past large targets, the firm decided on a softer approach. They worried about angering Mr. Son, over whom they had little leverage, given his No. 1 stake. The best bet, they decided, was to make an appeal based on logic and the math behind the stock’s poor performance.</p><p>该公司没有像埃利奥特过去对大型目标所做的那样，发起一场公开活动，用自己的要求让软银大吃一惊，而是决定采取一种更温和的方式。他们担心激怒孙正义，考虑到孙正义的头号股份，他们对他几乎没有影响力。他们认为，最好的办法是根据股票糟糕表现背后的逻辑和数学原理提出上诉。</p><p>  To their surprise, Mr. Son was receptive. When he met Mr. Singer and his team in January in Tokyo, he agreed SoftBank’s stock was undervalued and openly wondered why he wasn’t as revered as legendary value investor Warren Buffett, said one person in attendance.</p><p>令他们惊讶的是，孙正义接受了。一位与会人士说，今年1月在东京与辛格及其团队会面时，辛格同意软银的股票被低估了，并公开质疑为什么他不如传奇价值投资人巴菲特(Warren Buffett)那么受人尊敬。</p><p>  Mr. Singer told him one way to help boost the stock price was to improve corporate governance, including adding women to its all-male board and implementing more checks and balances for Mr. Son, measures SoftBank has since implemented. Elliott also suggested SoftBank commit to buying back $10 billion to $20 billion of stock—up to a quarter of shares outstanding at the time.</p><p>辛格告诉他，帮助提振股价的一个方法是改善公司治理，包括增加全由男性组成的董事会中的女性成员，并对孙正义实施更多制衡措施，软银自那以来一直在实施这些措施。埃利奥特还建议软银承诺回购100亿至200亿美元的股票-至多占当时流通股的四分之一。</p><p>  Mr. Son didn’t commit to Elliott’s suggestions, appearing to signal he favored a more gradualist approach, including buying back less stock. Elliott decided to take a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>孙正义并未承诺接受埃利奥特的建议，似乎暗示他倾向于采取更循序渐进的方式，包括减少股票回购。埃利奥特决定采取观望态度。</p><p>  Then in March, the market panic over Covid-19 and tightening social restrictions pummeled his empire. While some of the Vision Fund’s companies benefited—including e-commerce and medical firms—many of its biggest investments were in businesses getting hammered, including WeWork,  Uber Technologies  Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and Oyo Hotels &amp; Homes. SoftBank’s share price fell 25% during the first two weeks of March.</p><p>然后在3月份，市场对新冠肺炎的恐慌和不断收紧的社会限制打击了他的帝国。虽然远景基金的一些公司受益，包括电子商务和医疗公司，但它的许多最大投资都是在遭受重创的企业，包括WeWork、优步科技(Uber Technologies)、滴滴出行科技有限公司(Didi Chuxing Technology Co.)和Oyo Hotels&amp；Home。软银的股价在3月的前两周下跌了25%。</p><p>    On March 13,  SoftBank announced it would buy back as much as 7% of its shares, roughly $4.8 billion at the time, an amount similar to previous buybacks.</p><p>3月13日，软银宣布将回购至多7%的股份，当时的回购金额约为48亿美元，与之前的回购金额类似。</p><p>  The team inside Elliott was surprised and frustrated by the buyback’s size, which they deemed lacking the urgency needed. The frequency of phone conversations between the firms increased—sometimes involving Mr. Son and Mr. Singer—until they were speaking daily.</p><p>埃利奥特内部的团队对回购的规模感到惊讶和沮丧，他们认为回购缺乏必要的紧迫性。两家公司之间的电话交谈频率越来越高--有时涉及孙正义和辛格--直到他们每天都在通话。</p><p>  On the calls, SoftBank executives at first said the larger buyback Elliott had requested wasn’t necessary. Elliott executives kept pressing as SoftBank’s stock price fell more than the broader market in the days following the announcement.</p><p>在电话会议上，软银高管起初说，埃利奥特要求的更大规模的回购没有必要。埃利奥特高管继续施压，因为软银股价在宣布消息后的几天里跌幅超过大盘。</p><p>    The price brokers were charging to insure against a SoftBank default—known as a credit-default swap—was spiking, and credit-rater Standard &amp; Poor’s had downgraded the company’s outlook on March 17.</p><p>经纪商为防范软银违约(即信用违约互换)而收取的价格正在飙升，信用评级机构标准普尔(Standard&amp；Poor‘s)在3月17日下调了软银的评级展望。</p><p>  By Thursday, March 19, SoftBank’s shares had fallen 40% in just over a week, and its market capitalization had tumbled to around a quarter of the value of its assets. Mr. Son was personally affected when SoftBank’s falling share price depressed the value of shares he had pledged as collateral for loans, forcing him to pledge nearly three-quarters of his holdings at one point. Mr. Son has since said the situation has improved quite a bit. SoftBank said the board, not Mr. Son, made its decision to sell assets and buy back shares and that “Mr. Son’s personal circumstances had nothing to do with such decision.”</p><p>截至3月19日星期四，软银股价在一周多一点的时间里下跌了40%，市值暴跌至资产价值的四分之一左右。当软银股价下跌压低了他作为贷款抵押品质押的股票价值时，孙正义本人受到了影响，迫使他一度质押了近四分之三的股份。孙正义后来说，情况已经有了相当大的改善。软银表示，做出出售资产和回购股票决定的是董事会，而不是孙正义，“孙正义的个人情况与这一决定无关。”</p><p>  On Saturday, March 21, SoftBank called a multi-hour meeting with large shareholders, including Elliott’s Mr. Singer to pitch the idea of taking SoftBank private. Mr. Son had floated the idea off and on through the years, and some portfolio managers and analysts at Elliott were interested. But the other shareholders were ultimately not on board with the proposal.</p><p>3月21日(周六)，软银与包括埃利奥特(Elliott)的辛格在内的大股东召开了长达数小时的会议，提出将软银私有化的想法。孙正义多年来断断续续地提出了这个想法，埃利奥特的一些投资组合经理和分析师对此很感兴趣。但其他股东最终并不支持这项提议。</p><p>  On Monday, March 23, SoftBank announced a plan to sell $41 billion in assets and use the money to buy back an additional $18 billion in shares—more than Elliott had asked for when including the previously announced buyback. The move surprised even the biggest supporters of the SoftBank bet within Elliott.</p><p>3月23日(周一)，软银宣布了一项计划，出售410亿美元的资产，并用这笔钱再回购180亿美元的股票--这超过了埃利奥特在计入之前宣布的回购计划时提出的要求。就连埃利奥特内部最大的软银赌注支持者也对此感到意外。</p><p>   Within months, SoftBank had signed deals to sell most of what it had pledged to in March, agreeing to part with chunks of prized holdings such as Alibaba, U.S. carrier  T-Mobile US Inc., and the company’s Japanese mobile-phone unit. SoftBank’s share price soared.</p><p>几个月内，软银就签署了出售3月份承诺的大部分股份的协议，同意出售阿里巴巴、美国运营商T-Mobile美国公司(T-Mobile US Inc.)和该公司日本手机部门等大量宝贵股份。软银股价飙升。</p><p>  SoftBank has been selling off assets and piling up cash, a lot of which isn&#39;t yet earmarked for use.</p><p>软银一直在出售资产并囤积现金，其中很多还没有指定用途。</p><p>          *Deal not expected to close until 2022; $40 billion is maximum amount. Some deals are not expected to close for years.</p><p>*交易预计要到2022年才能完成；400亿美元是最高金额。一些交易预计数年内不会完成。</p><p>  Mr. Son kept selling, surprising Elliott and other investors. SoftBank agreed to sell Arm to  Nvidia  for as much as $40 billion. SoftBank sold an additional 22% piece of its Japanese mobile-phone unit for $11.6 billion and a U.S. wireless-services provider it had bought several years back.</p><p>孙正义继续抛售，让埃利奥特和其他投资者大吃一惊。软银同意以高达400亿美元的价格将ARM出售给英伟达。软银以116亿美元出售了日本移动电话部门22%的股份，并出售了几年前收购的一家美国无线服务提供商。</p><p>  Top brass from SoftBank and Elliott now connect multiple times a month to discuss SoftBank’s next steps. SoftBank executives have told Elliott and other shareholders that taking the company private is possible but not currently on the table, said people familiar with the matter.</p><p>软银和埃利奥特的高层现在每个月都会多次会面，讨论软银的下一步行动。知情人士表示，软银高管已告诉埃利奥特和其他股东，将公司私有化是可能的，但目前还不在讨论范围内。</p><p>  SoftBank is also working on developing a “blank-check” company to raise money in a public offering, then find an acquisition target.</p><p>软银还致力于发展一家“空白支票”公司，通过公开募股筹集资金，然后寻找收购目标。</p><p>  One recent development at SoftBank that worries some in Elliott is a new asset-management arm Mr. Son announced in mid-August as cash piled up, to which he will contribute himself. He now personally directs a team of traders using $20 billion of the cash pile to bet on daily moves in tech names including  Alphabet   Amazon  com Inc. and  Netflix  said people familiar with his trading.</p><p>软银最近的一个进展让埃利奥特的一些人感到担忧，那就是孙正义在8月中旬宣布的一个新的资产管理部门，当时现金正在堆积，他将自己出资。他现在亲自领导一个交易员团队，用200亿美元的现金押注包括Alphabet Amazon com Inc.在内的科技公司的每日走势。Netflix说，熟悉他交易的人说。</p><p>    On an investor call, Mr. Son explained he was putting his own money in the new venture because he wasn’t a “bonus and salary guy” and felt the need to take risk and make money if his bets worked out. A person familiar with the investing arm said Mr. Son has for now set aside his 300-year focus to concentrate on directing his daily trades.</p><p>孙正义在一次投资者电话会议上解释说，他之所以把自己的钱投入新公司，是因为他不是一个喜欢奖金和薪水的人，如果他的赌注成功，他觉得有必要冒险赚钱。一位熟悉该投资部门的人士说，孙正义暂时搁置了300年来的工作重心，专注于指导日常交易。</p><p>  Some of SoftBank’s other institutional shareholders said they were confused by the flurry of trading and wondered if Mr. Son was readying another multibillion-dollar investment.</p><p>软银的其他一些机构股东说，他们对纷至沓来的交易感到困惑，他们想知道孙正义是否准备再投资数十亿美元。</p><p>  Mr. Son’s traders bought options that at one point were tied to around $50 billion of individual tech stocks, a massive bet on Silicon Valley that caused SoftBank’s stock price to drop 7% after the trade became public in early September.
