The factory also benefited from a \u20ac60 million ($71.4 million) investment from the German government and the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where it will be located. Chemical company BASF SE was selected to supply the cathode materials.\n The batteries will use silicon as the anode material, which Porsche says will significantly boost the energy density and their capacity to withstand high temperatures \u2013 both important variables for racing cars, which must be recharged quickly, but challenging in battery production (batteries don\u2019t tend to like getting very hot).\n  For that reason, the factory will be small scale, at least compared to other automakers such as the 35 gigawatt-hour \u201cgigafactory\u201d capacity at the Tesla and Panasonic joint facility in Sparks, Nevada or even its parent company VW\u2019s plan to bring  240 GwH of production to Europe by 2030. Porsche and Customcells\u2019 aim is an annual capacity of 100 megawatt-hours, or around enough batteries for 1,000 vehicles, starting in 2024. The initial workforce is expected to grow from around 13 people to up to 80 by 2025.\n The automaker has no plans to scale the technology for use in Porsche\u2019s more mainstream lineup of vehicles, Steiner said, though he noted that there may be a chance for higher volume in the future if the company sees a potential to bring down production costs. \u201cIn this market, we are looking for special purpose cells for high-end cars and motorsports, and this is not available in the market today,\u201d he said.\n It may be a challenge to scale this technology to passenger vehicles. The silicon anode-based cell chemistry has not shown the capacity to function in very cold conditions or to remain stable over many charging cycles, Porsche said in a statement. But it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a Porsche vehicle benefited from technology developed for the race track: its leading electric model Taycan borrowed many of its technical features from the Porsche 919 Hybrid racing car.\n Although the first vehicles to use these batteries will be Porsche-made, Steiner said the technology will be made available to other brands in the Volkswagen Group, like Lamborghini or Bugatti.\n \u201cThe battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,\u201d Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement Monday. \u201cThis joint venture allows us to position ourselves at the forefront of global competition in developing the most powerful battery cell and make it the link between the unmistakable Porsche driving experience and sustainability. This is how we shape the future of the sports car.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6027\u80fd,\u4e60\u60ef,high,\u7535\u6c60", "title": "\u4fdd\u65f6\u6377\u7528\u4e60\u60ef\u4e3a\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7535\u6c60 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPorsche to make high-performance batteries in joint venture with Customcells\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u80fd", "\u4e60\u60ef", "high", "\u7535\u6c60"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "17fc0b65066fe60754f721ca374b8e44.jpg", "infoid": 1067217, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6d88\u8d39\u7684Fintech\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u90e8\u95e8\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d44\u91d1\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u7ea7\u6602\u8d35\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u57282020\u5e74\u4ee3\u540e\u671f\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u7ecf\u8425\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n Neobanks\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u94f6\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u5f80\u5f80\u7684\u4f4e\u6536\u5de5\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u63a8\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u7403\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0cNeobanks\u5728\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u3002\u79c1\u4eba\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6597\u58eb\u7ade\u4e89Neobanks\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168 - \u5ba2\u6237 - \u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u5165\u3002\n  \u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u63a2\u7d22\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u3002\u6bcf\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u90fd\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7d27\u7f29\u6216\u6bcf\u5468\u516d\u83b7\u5f97\u4ea4\u6362\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n  \u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u613f\u610f\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7530\u7eb3\u514b\u65af\u7684\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u8d44\u52a9\u5de8\u989d\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u6025\u5267\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7f8e\u56fd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005Fintech Chime\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u7684EBITDA  - \u4e00\u4e2a\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u516c\u5236 - \u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7684\u65b0\u53f0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5d07\u62dc\u7684\u9769\u547d\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u6df1\u7684\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe2020.\u4f46\u662f\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u6316\u6398\u5176\u5b63\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u597d\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u7ebd\u4f2f\u514b\u65af\u7ec8\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\n \u6240\u4ee5\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6212\u5f8b\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceStarling\u548cMonzo\u6316\u6398\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6765\u81ea\u7f57\u798f\u7279\u7684\u6709\u70b9\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bfa\u8d1d\u514b\uff1f \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684Romain Dillet\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e7f\u6cdb\u770b\u51fa\u7f57\u798f\u7279\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u5173\u5fc3\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002  \u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u4e3b\u65e8\u662f\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u662f\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bdb\u5229\u7387\u5141\u8bb8\u5176\u6bdb\u5229\u4e8e2020\u5e74\u98d9\u5347\u3002 ", "note_en": "Building a consumer-facing fintech company is expensive. And if you want to build one in a sector crowded by both incumbent companies and richly funded startups, it can be  super expensive.\n That was the  lesson we learned in late 2020 by examining operating results from a number of neobanks.\n Neobanks are essentially software layers atop banking infrastructure, offering consumers digital-first, mobile-friendly and often lower-fee banking services. The push to rethink consumer banking is a global effort, with neobanks cropping up in essentially every market you can think of. Private investors have shown up in droves to fund competing neobanks because they have the potential to secure users \u2014 customers \u2014 that generate revenues for long periods of time.\n  The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.   Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  Investors have proven more than willing to fund huge investments in growth and product at many neobanks, leading to steeply negative operating results at the unicorns. In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has  disclosed positive EBITDA \u2014 an adjusted profitability metric \u2014 many neobanks that we\u2019ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability.\n  Recent results from Revolut that  TechCrunch covered earlier this morning show that the company had a deeply unprofitable 2020. But if we dig into its quarterly results, there\u2019s good news to be found. Neobanks could be maturing into their cost structure at last.\n So today we\u2019ll parse the key Revolut financial results and look at what we can dig up from Starling and Monzo. Perhaps the somewhat good financial news from Revolut is not merely to be found at just one neobank?\n  Our own  Romain Dillet has a broad look at Revolut\u2019s business  here, if you would like a wider lens. We only care about its raw financial results at the moment.\n   The gist of these figures is that the company\u2019s revenue growth was solid, but improving gross margins allowed its gross profit to spike in 2020.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:16:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4f11\u606f,neobanks", "title":

before gathering in a dimly lit room packed with high-powered computers. There, coaches helped them learn to outmaneuver opponents in a digital fantasy world fraught with ambushes and monsters. School was over by 5 p.m., but individual practice continued well into the night \u2014 all in a hard day\u2019s work for the students at one of South Korea\u2019s many e-sports academies.\n \u201cI sleep only three or four hours a day,\u201d said Kim Min-soo, 17, a student who wore a brace around his right hand to lessen the pain from so much gaming. \u201cBut I want to become a star. I dream of an e-sports arena packed with fans all rooting for me.\u201d\n Students like Min-soo have brought the same intense competitive energy often associated with South Korean education to their training at e-sports academies. South Korea is considered a birthplace of e-sports, but the highly selective multibillion-dollar industry is still frowned upon by many in the country. The academies have worked to change that image and give thousands of young people a chance to pursue careers in a place where gaming has long been seen as a way of life.\n  \u201cIn South Korea, players must do homework on their game before playing it, because if they disrupt the efficiency of their \u200bteam, they can be expelled,\u201d said Jeon Dong-jin, Korea head of the American video game developer Blizzard Entertainment, during  a recent forum in Seoul. \u201cSouth Korean gamers are deadly serious.\u201d\n Online gaming took off sooner and faster in South Korea than anywhere else in the world. When the country began introducing high-speed internet in the late 1990s, it saw the proliferation of 24-hour gaming cafes called PC bangs.\n These dark, often underground parlors became hotbeds for gaming culture, eventually hosting informal tournaments. By 2000, South Korean cable channels were the first in the world to broadcast online gaming competitions.\n E-sports is now the fifth-most popular future job among South Korean students, after athletes, doctors, teachers and digital content creators, according to a survey by the Education Ministry last year. It will soon be a part of the Asian Games in 2022.\n Top players like  Lee Sang-hyeok, who goes by the gaming name Faker, earn as much fame and fortune as K-pop idols. Millions watch them play over livestream. Before the pandemic, fans packed into  e-sports arenas that looked like a cross between a rock concert and pro-wrestling stadium.\n  The allure can be hard to resist. Parents have dragged children to counseling for  gaming addiction or to rehabilitation  boot camps. When  conscientious objectors ask to be exempted from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service, officials will investigate whether they play online games involving guns and violence.\n Grades fall. Sometimes students drop out of school to spend more time gaming. Yet precious few will get the chance to make it big.\n The 10 franchised professional e-sports teams in South Korea competing in League of Legends, the most popular game here, hire only 200 players total. Those who do not make the cut have few alternatives.\n Lacking good grades \u2014 and often high school diplomas \u2014 gamers will find themselves with limited job prospects. And unlike some American universities, South Korean schools do not offer admission based on e-sports skills.\n When  Gen.G, a California-based e-sports company, opened its  Gen.G Elite Esports Academy in Seoul in 2019, it wanted to address some of those challenges because \u201cthis is where most of the talent is,\u201d said Joseph Baek, program director at the Gen.G academy. \u201cSouth Korea is still considered the mecca of e-sports.\u201d\n The school trains young South Koreans and other students on how to turn pro and helps gaming buffs find opportunities as streamers, marketers and data analysts. Together with the educational company  Elite Open School, it opened an English-only program that offers students a chance to earn an American high school diploma so they can apply to universities in the United States on e-sports scholarships.\n  On a recent morning, the sleep-deprived teenagers filed into Elite Open School wearing masks and branded T-shirts and hoodies. Divided into classrooms named after American universities like Columbia, M.I.T. and Duke, they studied English, American history and other required subjects. Some commuted two hours each morning to school.\n \u201c\u200bMy challenge is how to keep them awake and engaged during class,\u201d said Sam Suh, an English teacher.\n The real work began in the afternoon, when two buses carried the young gamers to a modest concrete building in a residential area for another intense training session at the Gen.G academy.\n Anthony Bazire, a 22-year-old former Gen.G academy student from France, said he had chosen South Korea as his training ground because he knew the country had some of the best players. Today, top prize winners in  League of Legends,  Overwatch and  StarCraft II are mostly South Koreans.\n \u201cWhen you see people working hard, it pushes you to work hard,\u201d he said.\n  The Gen.G program, the first of its kind in South Korea, has even helped some students convince their parents that they made a smart career move.\n In 2019, his second year in high school, Kim Hyeon-yeong played League of Legends for 10 hours a day. \u200bHis skills improved as he romped his way through the digital fantasy world\u200b. That summer, he decided to become a pro e-sports player, and quit school.\n \u201cMy parents were totally against it,\u201d said Mr. Kim, 19. \u201cI told them that I would have no regrets, because this was the one thing I wanted to try in my life, throwing in everything I got.\u201d\n His mother, Lee Ji-eun, 46, was so distressed that she lay in bed moaning. Ms. Lee eventually decided to support her son after he asked her one day: \u201cMom, what dream did you have when you were my age? Have you lived that dream?\u201d\n  Mr. Kim researched the Gen.G program, which costs $25,000 a year, and led his mother to the academy to convince her that he could find success as an e-sports professional. He cleared a big hurdle to his dream this year by winning admission, based on his online game skills, into the University of Kentucky.\n Mr. Bazire, the French gamer, joined Gen.G\u2019s League of Legends team as a trainee player in March. He and other trainees receive modest salaries along with food and lodging at a shared apartment in Seoul. They practice up to 18 hours a day, 60 to 70 percent more than players he knew in France, he said.\n But becoming a trainee is little more than securing a toehold. Trainees must climb fast through the second division to the main league, where professional League of Legends players are paid an average salary of $200,000 a year, and prize money and sponsorship deals.\n With younger and nimbler talents catching up constantly, the careers of most e-sports athletes in South Korea end before they turn 26, around the time when Korean men in their late 20s feel pressure to begin their mandatory military service.\n Min-soo, the student who dreams of becoming an e-sports star, first felt the electrifying vibe of an e-sports arena when he was in middle school. Since 2019, he has woken up at 6 a.m. every day, taking a two-hour bus and subway ride to the Gen.G academy. He returns home at 11:30 p.m. and then practices more, seldom going to bed before 3 a.m.\n This year, he was finally considered good enough to start taking tests to become a trainee on a pro team.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a hard and lonely life, because you have to give up everything else, like friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am happiest because I am doing what I enjoy the most.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:06:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "sports,\u97e9\u56fd,rise,\u6e38\u620f", "title": "\u770b\u770b\u97e9\u56fd\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5d1b\u8d77\uff0c\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7ade\u4e89\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\uff0c\u5e76\u52aa\u529b\u5728\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "A look at the huge rise of esports in South Korea, where thousands of young people compete to go pro, and efforts to create sustainable jobs in the industry", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/world/asia/south-korea-esports.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["sports", "\u97e9\u56fd", "rise", "\u6e38\u620f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cda9e9d41d93a93666ef59f881ad4bb7.png", "infoid": 1067215, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Shopify\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u5546\u5e97\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5546\u5bb6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u4eec\u6362\u53d6\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u5165\u7684\u524a\u51cf\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\n \u65b0\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u8054\u76df\u8425\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u548c\u6c83\u5c14\u739b\u7b49\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u96f6\u552e\u5de8\u5934\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u63d0\u4f9b\u51fa\u7248\u5546\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u6709\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7ad9\u5c06\u4e1a\u52a1\u53d1\u9001\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u90a3\u4e9b\u9500\u552e\u3002 BuzzFeed\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u65b0\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5176\u73b0\u573a\u3002\u719f\u6089\u6b64\u4e8b\u7684\u4eba\u4eec\u719f\u6089\uff0cShopify\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548cVOX\u5a92\u4f53\u3002\n    Shopify\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u5546\u5e97\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5546\u5bb6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u4eec\u6362\u53d6\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u5165\u7684\u524a\u51cf\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u65b0\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u79f0\u4e3a\u8054\u76df\u8425\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u53d1\u5e03\u5546\u548c...
