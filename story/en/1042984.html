Find the collection  here.</p><p>编者注：大西洋正在向所有读者提供有关冠状病毒的重要报道。在这里找到收藏。</p><p> A new variant of the coronavirus is spreading across the globe. It was first identified in the United Kingdom, where it is rapidly spreading, and has been found in multiple countries. Viruses mutate all the time, often with no impact, but this one appears to be more transmissible than other variants—meaning it spreads more easily. Barely one day after officials announced that America’s first case of the variant had been found in the United States, in a Colorado man with no history of travel, an additional case was found in California.</p><p> 冠状病毒的新变种正在全球范围内传播。它首先在英国迅速发现，并迅速传播，并在多个国家被发现。病毒一直在变异，通常不会产生影响，但是这种病毒似乎比其他变种更容易传播，这意味着它更容易传播。几乎没有一天，官方宣布在美国发现了第一例该变种，在科罗拉多州的一个没有旅行史的男子中，又有一个病例在加利福尼亚被发现。</p><p>   There are still many unknowns, but much concern has focused on whether this new variant would throw off vaccine efficacy or cause more severe disease—with some degree of relief after an initial study  indicated that it did not do either. And while we need more data to feel truly reassured, many scientists believe that this variant  will not decrease vaccine efficacy much, if at all. Health officials have started  emphasizing the  lack of evidence for more severe disease.</p><p>   仍然有许多未知数，但是很多关注点都集中在这个新变种是否会降低疫苗功效或引起更严重的疾病上-在初步研究表明它也不做之后，在某种程度上有所缓解。尽管我们需要更多数据才能真正放心，但许多科学家认为，即使有这种变异，也不会大大降低疫苗功效。卫生官员已经开始强调缺乏更严重疾病的证据。</p><p>  A more transmissible variant of COVID-19 is a potential catastrophe in and of itself. If anything, given the stage in the pandemic we are at, a more transmissible variant is in some ways much more dangerous than a more severe variant. That’s because higher transmissibility subjects us to a more contagious virus spreading with exponential growth, whereas the risk from increased severity would have increased in a linear manner, affecting only those infected.</p><p>  COVID-19的更易传播的变体本身就是潜在的灾难。如果有的话，考虑到我们处于大流行的阶段，在某些方面，更易传播的变异形式比更严重的变异形式更加危险。这是因为较高的可传播性使我们更容易传播具有传染性的病毒，并呈指数增长，而严重性增加的风险会呈线性增加，仅影响被感染的人。</p><p>  Increased transmissibility can wreak havoc in a very, very short time—especially when we already have uncontrolled spread in much of the United States. The short-term implications of all this are significant, and worthy of attention, even as we await more clarity from data. In fact, we should act quickly  especially as we await more clarity—lack of data and the threat of even faster exponential growth argue for more urgency of action. If and when more reassuring data come in, relaxing restrictions will be easier than undoing the damage done by not having reacted in time.</p><p>  传播能力的提高会在非常非常短的时间内造成严重破坏，尤其是在我们已经在美国许多地区肆无忌spread地蔓延的时候。所有这些对短期的影响都是重大的，值得关注，即使我们在等待数据更加清晰的时候也是如此。实际上，我们应该迅速采取行动，尤其是在等待更加清晰的信号时-数据不足以及指数增长更快的威胁表明，行动更加紧迫。如果有更多令人放心的数据出现，放宽限制比通过不及时做出反应来消除损害要容易得多。</p><p>   To understand the difference between exponential and linear risks, consider  an example put forth by Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine who focuses on mathematical analyses of infectious-disease outbreaks. Kucharski compares a 50 percent increase in virus lethality to a 50 percent increase in virus transmissibility. Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections—a plausible scenario for many European cities, as Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those numbers, we’d expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month—assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.</p><p>   要了解指数风险和线性风险之间的区别，请考虑伦敦卫生与安全学院教授Adam Kucharski提出的示例。致力于传染病暴发的数学分析的热带医学。库查尔斯基将病毒的致死率提高了50％，将病毒的传播能力提高了50％。假设病毒繁殖率约为1.1，感染致死风险为0.8％，并想象有10,000例活动感染，就像Kucharski指出的那样，对于许多欧洲城市而言，这是一个合理的情况。从目前的情况来看，根据这些数字，我们预计一个月内将有129人死亡。如果死亡率上升50％，将导致193人死亡。相比之下，如果将传播率提高50％，则仅在一个月内就将导致978人死亡，而在两种情况下，假设产生感染的时间都是六天。</p><p>  Transmissibility increases can quickly—very quickly—expand the baseline: Each new infected person potentially infects many more people. Severity increases affect only the infected person. That infection is certainly tragic, and this new variant’s lack of increase in severity or lethality thankfully means that the variant is not a bigger threat to the individual who may get infected. It is, however, a bigger threat to society because it can dramatically change the number of infected people. To put it another way, a small percentage of a very big number can easily be much, much bigger than a big percentage of a small number.</p><p>  传播能力的提高可以迅速（非常迅速地）扩大基准线：每个新感染的人都可能感染更多的人。严重程度提高仅影响感染者。这种感染肯定是悲剧性的，值得庆幸的是，这种新变种的严重性或致死性并未提高，这意味着该变种对可能被感染的个体没有更大的威胁。但是，这对社会构成了更大的威胁，因为它可以极大地改变受感染人数。换句话说，非常大的一小部分可能比非常大的一小部分大得多。 </p><p> I dismissed the news initially because viruses mutate all the time and there have been too many baseless “mutant-ninja virus” doomsaying headlines this year. The exaggerated, clickbaity alarmism makes it harder to discern real threats from sensationalism. Given the constant reality of mutation, genomic variants should be considered innocent until proved guilty. Even an increase in the proportion of cases attributable to a particular variant is not definitive proof of an evolutionary advantage.</p><p>我最初不屑一顾，因为病毒一直在变异，而且今年有太多毫无根据的“变异忍者病毒”在末日成为头条新闻。夸张的点击式警惕性使辨别煽情主义的真正威胁变得更加困难。鉴于不断发生的突变，在证明有罪之前，应将基因组变异视为无辜的。即使归因于特定变体的病例比例增加，也不是进化优势的确定证据。</p><p>   However, as data on the new variant roll in, there is cause for real concern. Trevor Bedford, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and a board member for the Covid Tracking Project at  The Atlantic,  points out that infections from the new variant are increasing very rapidly among the population in the U.K. Bedford also notes that this new variant seems to have  a higher secondary-attack rate—meaning the number of people subsequently infected by a known case—compared with “regular” COVID-19.  Finally, the new variant seems to result in  higher viral loads (though this is harder to be sure about as viral loads can be affected by sampling bias and timing). As Kucharski told me, all of this does not rule out other explanations. This increased transmission could be due to chance or founder effects—meaning one variant just happened to get somewhere before the other variants and then got “lucky”; it was early, rather than more transmissible. It could be due to changed behavior among people—quarantine fatigue, less masking—leading to more rapid spread. However, given the current evidence, along with the specifics of the mutation, it’s getting harder to assume that those other explanations are more likely than the simple proposition that this is truly a more transmissible variant.</p><p>   但是，随着有关新变体的数据的到来，确实引起了人们的关注。弗雷德·哈钦森癌症研究中心的科学家，大西洋沿岸的Covid追踪项目的董事会成员Trevor Bedford指出，新变异的感染在英国人口中增长非常迅速。Bedford还指出，这一新变异与“常规” COVID-19相比，二级攻击率似乎更高（这意味着随后被已知病例感染的人数）。最后，新的变体似乎会导致更高的病毒载量（尽管由于采样偏差和采样时间会影响病毒载量，所以很难确定这一点）。正如Kucharski告诉我的那样，所有这些都不排除其他解释。这种增加的传播可能是由于偶然或创始人的影响，这意味着一个变体恰好在其他变体之前到达某个地方，然后变得“幸运”。这是早期，而不是更容易传播。这可能是由于人们之间的行为发生了变化-隔离疲劳，掩盖较少-导致传播更快。但是，鉴于目前的证据以及突变的具体情况，人们越来越难以认为这些其他解释要比简单的命题更有可能，因为这确实是一种更容易传播的变体。</p><p>  So how much more transmissible? We aren’t completely sure yet, but the initial estimates from the data suggest that this variant could be  about 50 to 70 percent more transmissible than regular COVID-19. To make matters thornier, we aren’t yet exactly sure why it’s more transmissible, though reasonable theories are already being tested. This variant,  now called B.1.1.7, has “an unusually large number of genetic changes, particularly in the spike protein,” which is how the virus gains entry into our cells. The new variant  may be better at eluding our immune response and replicating, or be able to better bind to locations in our body more conducive to infecting others, but that is all speculative for the moment.</p><p>  那么还有多少可以传播？我们尚未完全确定，但是根据数据进行的初步估算表明，该变体的可传播性比常规COVID-19大约高50％至70％。使问题更棘手的是，尽管合理的理论已经受到考验，但我们尚不确定为什么它更容易传播。现在被称为B.1.1.7的这种变体具有“异常大量的遗传变化，特别是在刺突蛋白中”，这就是病毒进入我们细胞的方式。新的变体可能更好地掩盖了我们的免疫反应和复制，或者能够更好地结合到我们体内更有利于感染他人的位置，但目前还只是推测。</p><p> This uncertainty in understanding the variant’s exact mechanisms means that we don’t know if our existing tools—masks, distancing, and disinfecting—are as effective as they were compared with an identical scenario with the regular variant. To be clear: The variant is still a respiratory virus, so the basic tools will not change, and they will all continue to work. In fact, they have become more important, but we may need to be stricter—less time indoors, better masks, better ventilation, more disinfection of high-touch surfaces—to get the same bang for our protective buck. It may be a small difference, or not. We don’t know. We won’t know for a while.</p><p> 在理解变体的确切机制方面存在不确定性，这意味着我们不知道我们现有的工具（遮罩，隔离和消毒）是否能与常规变体的相同方案相比有效。需要明确的是：该变种仍然是呼吸道病毒，因此基本工具不会改变，并且它们都将继续起作用。实际上，它们已经变得越来越重要，但是我们可能需要更严格一些-室内更少的时间，更好的口罩，更好的通风，高接触表面的更多消毒-才能为我们的防护产品带来同样的收益。可能差异不大。我们不知道我们一会儿不会知道。</p><p>   Given that this new variant is already here in America, are we too late? No, but we are on our back foot. The United States does not have extensive  genomic surveillance, or a rapid turnaround with what surveillance it has, so in some ways, we are flying without a map. We have some indications that the variant is—so far—probably relatively rare  in the United States.</p><p>   鉴于这种新变体已经在美国上市，我们为时已晚？不，但是我们背着脚。美国没有广泛的基因组监视，也没有迅速的周转，因此在某些方面，我们没有地图就在飞行。我们有迹象表明，到目前为止，该变体在美国可能相对较少。</p><p> This could, of course, change extremely quickly, before we can even detect that change, but that highlights the importance of early action. In addition to the threat of exponential growth, we must remember that this pathogen is  quite overdispersed—meaning some people seem to cause many infections, while many do not transmit it at all (though these ratios may change as well). Early on, there was a lot of hand-wringing about why some European cities were very badly hit while others were spared—spared only until later, it often turned out—despite similar policies. The answer could be just a bit of bad luck and a few weeks of delay: For exponential processes, small initial differences can mean gargantuan differences in the long run, and we are not helpless.</p><p> 当然，在我们甚至还没有发现这种变化之前，这可能会非常迅速地改变，但这突出了早期行动的重要性。除了指数增长的威胁外，我们还必须记住，这种病原体非常分散，这意味着某些人似乎会引起许多感染，而许多人根本不会传播（尽管这些比率也可能发生变化）。早期，尽管有类似的政策，但为什么欧洲一些城市遭受严重打击而另一些城市却幸免于难-直到后来才保留下来，却屡屡发生，这真是令人费解。答案可能只是运气不佳和延迟几周：对于指数过程，小的初始差异在长期内可能意味着巨大的差异，而我们并非无可奈何。</p><p>  We can and should deploy whatever weapons we have in our arsenal, as soon as possible. If public-health officials can accelerate our ability to detect the new variant, they must. “You could imagine case-based interventions specifically targeting the early variant-transmission chains,” Bedford told me. “I wouldn’t expect to contain them, but I could imagine buying a week or two.”</p><p>  我们可以并且应该尽快部署我们军械库中拥有的任何武器。如果公共卫生官员可以提高我们发现新变异的能力，则必须这样做。 “您可以想象基于案例的干预措施专门针对早期的变异传播链，”贝德福德告诉我。 “我不希望包含它们，但是我可以想象买一两个星期。” </p><p>  A week or two may not seem like a lot, but combined with other aggressive public-health measures, we may actually gain a few additional weeks. Maybe all of that could delay this new variant’s widespread establishment until February or even March.</p><p>一两个星期似乎并不多，但结合其他积极的公共卫生措施，我们实际上可能会再增加几个星期。也许所有这些都可能将这个新变种的广泛建立推迟到2月甚至3月。</p><p> This moment is somewhat similar to America’s initial COVID-19 surge and shutdown in March. We need to once again talk about the importance of flattening the curve. We need to again preserve hospital capacity, so our fatality rate doesn’t increase. But this time around, we can be a lot more hopeful: We need to flatten the curve because delaying potential infections just a few weeks or a month can make a tremendous difference when highly effective vaccines are being rolled out.</p><p> 这一时刻有点类似于美国3月份最初的COVID-19激增和停产。我们需要再次谈论使曲线平坦的重要性。我们需要再次保持住院能力，因此我们的病死率不会增加。但是这次，我们可以寄予更大的希望：我们需要弄平曲线，因为在推出高效疫苗时，将潜在的感染延迟数周或一个月会产生巨大的变化。</p><p>  We are in a race against time, and the virus appears to be gaining an unfortunate ability to sprint just as we get closer to the finish line. Although the initial rollout of the vaccines has been slow, it is expected to increase rapidly. The U.S. may have 50 million to 100 million people vaccinated as early as March. That is a huge difference, one that could save many lives, especially since we also have perhaps that many people with some degree of postinfection immunity.</p><p>  我们正在与时间赛跑，而病毒似乎正变得越来越不幸，正当我们接近终点时。尽管最初推出疫苗的速度很慢，但预计会迅速增加。最早在3月，美国可能已有5000万至1亿人接种了疫苗。这是一个巨大的差异，可以挽救许多生命，尤其是因为我们也许还有很多人具有一定程度的感染后免疫能力。</p><p> Here’s how to think about it: Vaccinated people are a lot less likely to get sick in the first place. One hundred million vaccinated people will mean 100 million people with much less (or hardly any) risk for any symptomatic COVID-19, especially severe disease. That’s an enormous gain.</p><p> 这是怎么想的：首先，接种疫苗的人生病的可能性要小得多。 1亿人接种疫苗后，意味着1亿人患任何症状性COVID-19（尤其是严重疾病）的风险要低得多（或几乎没有）。那是巨大的收获。</p><p>  But that’s not all. Vaccines benefit not just the vaccinated, but potentially everyone else, too. Fewer people symptomatically sick with a contagious virus means fewer sick people infecting even more people. Every indication we have suggests that vaccinated people will also transmit less—how much less is still being studied, but the difference may well be substantive. The mRNA vaccines (both already approved in the United States) cut down symptomatic disease by about 95 percent. We already know that people who never develop symptomatic disease are  a lot less likely to transmit COVID-19. (Note the difference between people who are truly asymptomatic and people who are just about to get sick— presymptomatic—but are highly infectious.) In a preliminary study, the Moderna vaccine was found to even prevent  two-thirds of asymptomatic infections. Vaccinated people are thus not only much, much less likely to get any disease; they appear much less likely to get even a silent, asymptomatic infection. Although we need more data to be sure, all of this strongly suggests that vaccinated people will also transmit less. The fewer people there are to efficiently transmit a pathogen, the harder it is for that pathogen to spread.</p><p>  但这还不是全部。疫苗不仅使接种者受益，而且也可能使其他所有人受益。有症状地感染传染性病毒的人越少，意味着感染更多人的病人就越少。我们已经表明的每个迹象都表明，接种疫苗的人也会传播较少的病毒-仍在研究多少疫苗，但差异可能很大。 mRNA疫苗（均已在美国获得批准）将症状性疾病减少了约95％。我们已经知道，从未出现症状性疾病的人传播COVID-19的可能性要小得多。 （请注意，真正无症状的人与即将患病的人（有症状的人）但具有高度传染性的人之间的区别。）在一项初步研究中，发现Moderna疫苗甚至可以预防三分之二的无症状感染。因此，接种疫苗的人不仅很容易患任何疾病，而且感染的可能性也大大降低。他们似乎更不可能获得无声无症状的感染。尽管我们需要更多的数据来确定，但是所有这些都强烈表明，接种疫苗的人的传播率也会降低。有效传播病原体的人越少，病原体传播的难度就越大。</p><p>  Now that we have effective vaccines, flattening the curve into the future also means obliterating the curve. Dylan Morris, a postdoc at UCLA who studies virus transmission and quantitative biology of infectious disease, and a co-author of  a preprint paper studying the impact of timing on nonpharmaceutical interventions—such as reducing mobility and contacts, wearing masks, distancing, and avoiding indoor gatherings—told me that “delaying cases has always been valuable, but right now it is especially valuable. Buying even a bit of time to ramp up vaccination could avert a great deal of mortality and morbidity.” Every COVID-19 death is tragic, but with the existence of several effective vaccines, every death is now technically preventable too.</p><p>  现在我们已经有了有效的疫苗，将曲线展平到未来也意味着消除曲线。迪伦·莫里斯（Dylan Morris），加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）博士后，研究病毒传播和传染病定量生物学，是预印本的合著者，研究时间对非药物干预措施的影响，例如减少活动性和接触，戴口罩，疏远和避免室内聚会—告诉我，“延误案例一直很有价值，但是现在它特别有价值。”只要花一点时间来加强疫苗接种，就可以避免大量的死亡率和发病率。” COVID-19的每一次死亡都是悲惨的，但是由于存在几种有效的疫苗，从技术上讲，每一次死亡也可以预防。</p><p> Even without a vaccine, Morris said, knocking down the virus through temporary suppression can be valuable even though the virus will grow again, precisely because of these exponential effects. The same percentage growth amounts to a much smaller number of infected people when the baseline number is much smaller. Bringing the baseline level of contagion down also allows for safer experimentation: What happens if we relax X a bit? What restrictions work best? Which ones are most sustainable? If cases are growing from a very large base number, however, that means the state of the world is changing very quickly, so small mistakes are magnified. As Morris said, “You can’t finesse the steep part of an exponential.” He noted that throughout the pandemic, we bemoaned the absence of silver bullets while underestimating the value of crude hammers. But now we are in a different situation: We do have a silver bullet—vaccines—just as we have this new threat thrown at us. How we react in the next few weeks will matter immensely.</p><p> 莫里斯说，即使没有疫苗，即使由于这种指数效应，这种病毒会再次生长，通过暂时抑制将其击倒也很有价值。当基线人数要少得多时，相同的百分比增长意味着感染的人数要少得多。降低传染病的基线水平还可以进行更安全的实验：如果我们稍微放松X会发生什么？哪些限制最有效？哪些最可持续？但是，如果案件从一个非常大的基数增长，这意味着世界状况正在迅速变化，那么小错误就会被放大。正如莫里斯所说，“您无法精巧处理指数的陡峭部分。”他指出，在整个大流行中，我们为没有银弹而感到遗憾，同时低估了粗锤的价值。但是现在我们处在另一种情况下：我们确实拥有一头灵丹妙药（疫苗），就像我们面临新的威胁一样。在接下来的几周中，我们的反应方式将至关重要。 </p><p>   Imagine it this way: There is a tsunami heading our way, and we are ferrying people to a high point. Everyone we transport up to the top is safe, but even better, they can also help other people get to safety (the exponential desirable effect of the vaccine). The reverse is also true, however: Everyone we leave behind also pulls down more people (the exponential unwanted effect of increased transmissibility). And the whole process is very sensitive to when we start; it’s much easier in the beginning but gets nearly impossible as the wave grows higher and gets closer. With this variant, at least in the United States, we are likely at the beginning, or near the beginning.</p><p>试想一下：海啸正在袭来，我们正在把人们运送到高峰。我们运送到最高层的每个人都是安全的，但更好的是，它们还可以帮助其他人提高安全性（疫苗的指数效应）。但是，反之亦然：我们留下的每个人也会拉倒更多的人（增加可传递性的指数效应）。整个过程对我们何时开始非常敏感。一开始比较容易，但是随着浪潮越来越高越来越近，几乎变得不可能。使用此变体，至少在美国，我们很可能刚开始或即将开始。</p><p> All this means that the speed of the vaccine rollout is of enormous importance. There are already worrisome indicators of slow rollout. Vaccination of a broad population, not vaccines in and of themselves, saves lives, and epidemics are fought  with logistics and infrastructure. We should put every bit of energy, funding, and relentlessness into vaccinating as many people as possible as quickly as possible.</p><p> 所有这些意味着疫苗推出的速度非常重要。已经有令人担忧的缓慢部署指标。对广大人群进行疫苗接种，而不是本身进行疫苗接种，可以挽救生命，并通过后勤和基础设施应对流行病。我们应该尽一切力量，资金和不懈努力为尽可能多的人接种疫苗。</p><p>  Meanwhile, the United States was reportedly planning to  hold back half the vaccine it has in freezers as a hedge against supply-chain issues, and some states may be slowed down by murky prioritization plans. Scott Gottlieb—the former FDA chief and a current board member of Pfizer—has argued that the U.S. should also go ahead with vaccinating as many people as possible right now and trust that the supply chain will be there for the booster.  Researchers in Canada—where some provinces decided to vaccinate now as much as possible without holding half in reserve, and will administer the booster with future supplies—estimate that this type of front-loading can help “avert between 34 and 42 per cent more symptomatic coronavirus infections, compared with a strategy of keeping half the shipments in reserve.” (Note that this strategy, which is different from the one the United Kingdom  just announced it will adopt in prioritizing the first dose, does not even necessarily involve explicitly changing booster timing protocols in order to maximize vaccination now; it just means not waiting to get shots into arms when the vaccines are currently available.) These were already important conversations to have, but given the threat posed by this new variant,  they are even more urgent.</p><p>  同时，据报道，美国正计划将其所拥有的疫苗中的一半保留在冰柜中，以对付供应链问题，而一些州可能因模糊的优先计划而放慢了速度。前FDA负责人，辉瑞公司现任董事会成员斯科特·戈特利布（Scott Gottlieb）认为，美国也应该继续为尽可能多的人接种疫苗，并相信供应链将在这里为疫苗提供支持。加拿大的研究人员（一些省份决定在不保留一半储备的情况下，现在尽可能多地接种疫苗，并将用未来的补给品对加强疫苗进行管理）估计这种类型的前载可以帮助“将症状减轻34％至42％”与将一半货物保留备用的策略相比，冠状病毒感染。” （请注意，该策略与英国刚刚宣布将在优先使用第一剂疫苗时所采用的策略不同，甚至不必为了显着提高疫苗接种率而明确改变助推器计时方案;这只是意味着不等待获得这些已经是很重要的话题，但是鉴于这种新变种带来的威胁，它们变得更加紧迫。</p><p>   Maybe—just maybe—this variant will turn out to be a false alarm, not nearly as transmissible as we feared. We will know soon enough. Our precautions will still be net positives. But if it is indeed much more transmissible, we may face a true tragedy: exponential growth with massive numbers of illnesses and deaths just as highly effective vaccines are being made available. We’ve had a year to learn—about the importance of early action, of acting decisively even in the face of uncertainty, of not confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence. A year to learn to aim not for perfection in knowledge but for maximal impact even while considering the trade-offs. And most important, a year to learn to not wait when faced with threats with exponential dynamics but to act as early and as decisively as we can—and to adjust and tamper later, if warranted.</p><p>   也许-也许-这个变体将变成一个错误的警报，不会像我们担心的那样传播。我们很快就会知道。我们的预防措施仍将是积极的结果。但是，如果确实可以传播的话，我们可能会面临一场真正的悲剧：随着高效疫苗的问世，大量疾病和死亡的数量呈指数增长。我们有一年的时间要学习-了解早期行动的重要性，即使面对不确定性也要果断采取行动，不要将缺乏证据与缺乏证据混为一谈。一年学习时，即使考虑权衡取舍，也并非要追求知识的完美，而要争取最大的影响。最重要的是，一年要学会在面对指数动态威胁时不要等待，而是尽我们所能尽早采取果断行动，并在必要时进行调整和篡改。</p><p> “Exponentials are so cruel that nobody wants to look them in the eye,” Morris told me. This is true, but averting our eyes doesn’t avert the outcomes. Each one of us is now counting on every person who serves the public—mayors, city-council members, health officials, nurses, FDA regulators, members of Congress, journalists—to speak up now, and to speak up loudly. We must insist on swift and aggressive action, along with more resources, in order to get this right. It is not too late. Many lives depend on what we do next.</p><p> 莫里斯告诉我：“指数是如此残酷，以至于没人愿意看它们。”的确如此，但是睁大眼睛并不能避免结果。现在，我们每个人都指望为公众服务的每个人-市长，市议会议员，卫生官员，护士，FDA监管者，国会议员，新闻工作者-现在要大声说出来。为了做到这一点，我们必须坚持迅速采取积极行动，并增加资源。这还不算太晚。许多生活取决于我们下一步要做的事情。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/病毒/">#病毒</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/变异/">#变异</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/virus/">#virus</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/疫苗/">#疫苗</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
