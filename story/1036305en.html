She was 23, and by now she’d figured out that when she raised the pitch of her voice and dressed like an anime fantasy girl, switching her hair from purple to green to pink every few weeks, it drove certain guys wild. Guys like the CEO of this startup, a serial entrepreneur named Michael Williams. She examined him from her desk: he was 49 and seemed rich but painfully nerdy and obsessed with  Magic: The Gathering. Maybe if she acted all bubbly and let him stare, she could get a raise or a promotion. His crush was her opportunity.</p><p>当她的新老板开始抨击她时，罗尼*想知道她是否能够利用这种情况。她23岁，到现在，她想出了当她提高嗓音并打扮成动漫幻想女孩的样子，每隔几周就将头发从紫色变成绿色再变成粉红色时，某些人开始疯狂。像这家初创公司的首席执行官那样的家伙，是一个叫迈克尔·威廉姆斯的连续企业家。她从书桌上检查了他：他49岁，看上去很富有，但书呆子痛苦而痴迷于Magic：The Gathering。也许如果她举止得体，让他凝视，她可以得到加薪或晋升。他的暗恋是她的机会。</p><p> “I could tell he just wanted to hang out with a cute girl,” she tells me.</p><p> “我可以说他只是想和一个可爱的女孩一起出去玩，”她告诉我。</p><p> It was the summer of 2016, and this was Ronnie’s first office gig. “I called it my big girl job,” she says. Once she saw the perks of working in tech, she didn’t want to go back to retail. After all, Claire’s had never encouraged its mall employees to play beer pong at happy hour. The startup, called Oomba, was even doing something cool: building software that could run tournaments for any game, from Scrabble to soccer to  League of Legends. Ronnie liked video games, especially the art, and even a few trading card games, as long as they were fair and the rules stayed consistent. Yu-Gi-Oh, for example, she couldn’t stand. A few rare cards were too powerful, rigging the outcome. And where was the fun in that?</p><p> 那是2016年的夏天，这是罗尼（Ronnie）的第一场办公室演出。她说：“我称它为大女孩的工作。”一旦她看到了从事技术工作的好处，就不想再回到零售了。毕竟，克莱尔（Claire's）从未鼓励其商场员工在欢乐时光玩啤酒乒乓球。这家名为Oomba的创业公司甚至在做一些很棒的事情：开发可以运行任何游戏锦标赛的软件，从拼字游戏到足球再到英雄联盟。只要视频游戏公平且规则保持一致，罗尼就喜欢视频游戏，尤其是艺术品，甚至一些交易卡游戏。例如Yu-Gi-Oh，她受不了。一些稀有的卡片太强大了，从而影响了结果。有趣的地方在哪里？</p><p> “I think Mike was delusional, that he literally thought he was going to develop the next Facebook”</p><p> “我认为迈克是个幻想，他从字面上认为自己将要发展下一个Facebook”</p><p> Ronnie’s family had fled Mexico for Southern California when she was nine, after a cartel threatened to kill them if her father didn’t move drugs or at least pay a bribe. In the US, her parents worked hard, but she could relax. “My thing was just kind of partying,” she says. “A total scene kid.” At 20, she moved in with a boyfriend who became more and more domineering, until one day it escalated into a physical fight between them, and she says he picked her up by the throat and threw her. She left him, but in retrospect, Ronnie says she thinks Williams noticed she was “a damaged girl” and therefore vulnerable — that this was why he came by her desk, remembered her birthday, asked for her phone number.</p><p> 罗尼一家九岁时就逃离了墨西哥，前往南加州，此前卡特尔威胁说，如果她的父亲不吸毒或至少行贿，他们将杀死他们。在美国，她的父母努力工作，但她可以放松。她说：“我的事情只是开派对。” “一个总场景的孩子。” 20岁时，她与一个变得越来越霸气的男友住在一起，直到有一天，他们升级为他们之间的肉搏战，她说他在喉咙处将她抱起并扔了她。她离开了他，但回想起来，罗尼说她认为威廉姆斯注意到她是“一个受损的女孩”，因此很容易受到伤害-这就是为什么他来到她的办公桌旁，想起她的生日，问她的电话号码。</p><p> Two months after she started at Oomba, Williams invited her out after an office party.</p><p> 威廉姆斯在Oomba上班两个月后，经过一次办公室聚会邀请她出去。</p><p>  “Shhh,” he said — he’d meant just the two of them, alone.</p><p>  “嘘，”他说-他只是两个人的意思。</p><p> “Okay… yeah, sure,” Ronnie agreed. She tried to be accommodating, she tells me later. “I wanted to be his favorite, so I could stay there the longest and move up.”</p><p>“好吧……是的，”罗尼同意。她试着包容，稍后告诉我。 “我想成为他的最爱，所以我可以在那儿呆最长的时间，然后向上移动。”</p><p> Williams took Ronnie to an arcade and filled a card with points for her to play. In the flashing neon, above the clangs and hoots and whistles, he mentioned he also liked to go to strip clubs.  You like to spend money on girls, Ronnie thought,  so maybe you could spend some money my way.</p><p> 威廉姆斯（Williams）将罗尼（Ronnie）带到了一个街机店，并用点数填了一张卡片供她玩。在闪烁的霓虹灯中，叮当声，above叫声和哨笛声中，他提到自己也喜欢去脱衣舞俱乐部。罗尼想，你想在女孩身上花钱，所以也许你可以花点钱。</p><p> Afterward, in his BMW, Williams confided that being CEO wasn’t as fun as it seemed. He spent most of his time pestering investors, he said, trying to bring in more capital with a desperation that left him feeling like “a money whore.”</p><p> 后来，威廉姆斯（Williams）在他的宝马中坦言，担任首席执行官并不像看上去那样有趣。他说，他大部分时间都在困扰投资者，试图以绝望的方式引进更多的资金，这使他感到自己像个“妓女”。</p><p>  “I’m a money whore, too,” she told him. “I sell nudes online.”</p><p>  她告诉他：“我也是个妓女。” “我在网上出售裸照。”</p><p> “No way!” he said and offered her $500. It was more than the $130 she’d been charging guys on Tumblr for her collection, and more than she made in a week at Oomba. They stopped at an ATM, and she emailed him a drive of explicit photos and videos. This felt like a game she’d been playing for years. It was almost too easy.</p><p> “没门！”他说，并给了她500美元。这不仅比她在Tumblr上向收藏家收取的130美元还高，而且还超过她在Oomba一周内的收入。他们在自动取款机上停下来，她给他发了一封明确的照片和视频给他发电子邮件。感觉就像是她玩了多年的游戏。这太简单了。</p><p> “From that point forward, I basically became his sugar baby,” she tells me. “He even said he loved me, and I kind of feel that he did. But not in a healthy way — in a controlling, manipulative kind of way.” She’d thought that Williams would be “just another john,” that Oomba would be an easy win, but the rules kept changing and catching her by surprise. One move led to another, and soon everything got out of hand.</p><p> 她告诉我：“从那时起，我基本上成为了他的糖宝贝。” “他甚至说他爱我，我觉得他确实爱过我。但不是健康的方式，而是一种可控制的，操纵性的方式。”她曾以为威廉姆斯会“只是另一个约翰”，而翁巴将是一次轻松的胜利，但规则不断变化，令她大吃一惊。一招导致另一招，很快一切都变得一发不可收拾。</p><p>  By the summer of 2018, 18 months after Williams took Ronnie to the arcade, Oomba would be over, with Williams facing internal accusations of financial mismanagement and inappropriate sexual relationships. But first, after squeezing the same investors for years, and though Oomba had zero revenue, it seems the company raised about $35 million from Chicago firm ExWorks Capital and blew through all of it in about a year. Where did the money go? No one is quite sure. There was a seven-figure splurge on a Las Vegas extravaganza featuring  Big Bang Theory star Wil Wheaton that was so over budget  the company didn’t fully pay the venue, according to a former member of management. There were chic offices, where Williams fell hundreds of thousands of dollars behind in rent. And there were a whole lot of sex workers.</p><p>  到2018年夏天，在威廉姆斯将罗尼带到商场18个月后，Oomba结束了，威廉姆斯面临内部指控，涉及财务管理不善和不适当的性关系。但是首先，在挤压了相同的投资者多年之后，尽管Oomba的收入为零，但该公司似乎从芝加哥公司ExWorks Capital筹集了大约3500万美元，并在大约一年的时间里炸掉了所有资金。钱都去哪儿了？没有人能确定。一位前管理人员称，在一场由拉斯维加斯大爆炸理论明星威尔·惠顿（Wil Wheaton）主持的拉斯维加斯盛会上，挥霍了七位数，这笔预算太高了，公司未能全额支付场地费用。那里有别致的办公室，威廉姆斯在这里滞纳了数十万美元的租金。而且有很多性工作者。</p><p> I reviewed thousands of pages of documents and spoke with over 30 sources about Williams and Oomba, including investors, employees, and business partners. Most described him as narcissistic, a fast-talking salesman with a talent for separating people from their savings. He drank a lot of Red Bull and had a puerile sense of humor, asking an employee who brought her cat into work, “Can I pet your pussy?” again and again. Williams apparently didn’t like rules, couldn’t focus, and seemed unable to accept that he might ever be wrong. He could be volatile, swearing over text message (“if you don’t return my call by 5 PM you are fucking fired you fucking douche”) and chastising employees over the office PA system (“Come to my office now you dumb motherfucker”).</p><p>我审阅了数千页的文档，并与30多个有关Williams和Oomba的资料来源进行了交谈，其中包括投资者，员工和业务合作伙伴。多数人将他描述为自恋型，一个快速交谈的推销员，具有将人与他们的储蓄区分开的才能。他喝了很多红牛，并且有一种淡淡的幽默感，问一个让她的猫上班的雇员，“我可以宠你的猫吗？”一次又一次。威廉姆斯显然不喜欢规则，无法集中精力，并且似乎无法接受他可能错了。他可能会变得动荡不安，发誓要发短信（“如果您在下午5点之前不回电，那您就他妈的要开除您的混蛋”），并在办公室的公共广播系统上责骂员工（“现在到我的办公室来，您笨了，混蛋”） ）。</p><p> And he often stretched the truth, especially when doing so enabled access to more funding or let him out of paying for something.</p><p> 而且他经常伸张真理，尤其是在这样做可以使他们获得更多资金或让他不用花钱买东西的时候。</p><p> “It was my feeling that he cheated investors, he cheated employees, and he cheated vendors, and he felt zero guilt about that, I mean zero,” said one C-level executive who worked at Oomba for almost three years.</p><p> “在我看来，他欺骗了投资者，欺骗了员工，并且欺骗了供应商，对此他感到内为零，我的意思是零，”在Oomba工作了近三年的一位C级主管说。</p><p> (Williams refused repeated requests to speak with me, saying over text, “I hope you get all your facts straight and that you’ll spell my name correctly.”)</p><p> （威廉姆斯拒绝了再次与我交谈的要求，并在短信中说：“我希望您能弄清所有事实，并能正确拼写我的名字。”）</p><p> In some ways, the rise and fall of Oomba is so outlandish that it competes with the worst startup horror stories. Williams was allegedly dating three employees at a time. He raised over $250,000 on Kickstarter and never followed through on the project for which the money was meant. He pledged $400,000 in college sponsorships and only gave a quarter of it. He claimed that magician Penn Jillette and Atari founder Nolan Bushnell had invested in Oomba, something both men deny — though Bushnell is a friend who held  a formal role at one of Williams’ previous startups, which was called, almost unfathomably, Reality Gap.</p><p> 在某些方面，Oomba的兴衰是如此奇特，以至于与最糟糕的创业恐怖故事相抗衡。据称威廉姆斯一次与三名雇员约会。他在Kickstarter上筹集了超过25万美元的资金，但从没有进行过这笔钱意想不到的项目。他承诺提供40万美元的大学赞助，但只提供了四分之一。他声称魔术师Penn Jillette和Atari创始人Nolan Bushnell已投资了Oomba，双方都否认了这一点-尽管Bushnell是一位朋友，在威廉姆斯以前的一家初创公司中担任过正式职务，但几乎被称为Reality Gap。</p><p> “NBA stars were going to get involved, and Kobe Bryant would put in a million,” one Oomba investor recalls. “I think Mike was delusional, that he literally thought he was going to develop the next Facebook, but at some point, when he realized he wasn’t, he started lying.”</p><p> 一位Oomba投资者回忆说：“ NBA球星将参与其中，科比·布莱恩特将投入一百万。” “我认为迈克是个幻想，他从字面上认为自己将要发展下一个Facebook，但在某个时候，当他意识到自己不是Facebook时，他就开始撒谎。”</p><p> Bushnell, who has his own history of alleged inappropriate sexual behavior, is more forgiving. He describes Williams as “probably the most optimistic guy I’ve ever met,” and says he has no hard feelings about being falsely named in press releases as Oomba’s chief visionary officer, adding, “A lot of times, the difference between an optimist and a scoundrel is nuance.”</p><p> 布什内尔（Bushnell）曾经有过自己所谓的不当性行为的历史，但他的宽容程度更大。他将威廉姆斯描述为“可能是我见过的最乐观的人”，并说他对在新闻稿中被错误地任命为Oomba的首席远见官并不感到硬心，并补充说：“很多时候，乐观主义者之间的区别无赖是细微的差别。”</p><p> “He was wearing a suit two sizes too big and had a hole in the bottom of his shoe”</p><p>“他穿着的西装太大了两个，鞋子的鞋底有一个洞。”</p><p> Paychecks came late, if at all. Invoices went unpaid.  A $100,000 loan agreement was scanned and emailed without signatures, giving Williams cover to deny the loan had happened at all. And after four years, the company’s core product was never able to do what it said it was supposed to: work with any game. It’s possible this was because many of Oomba’s engineers were college students whom Williams apparently sometimes paid in free food and the promise of stock options. Or maybe, a few employees suggest, he preferred to keep the software unfinished.</p><p> 薪水迟到了，如果有的话。发票未付。扫描了一笔10万美元的贷款协议，并在没有签名的情况下通过电子邮件发送了电子邮件，威廉姆斯可以掩饰否认贷款已经发生。四年之后，该公司的核心产品再也无法做到其应有的功能：可以与任何游戏一起使用。这很可能是因为Oomba的许多工程师都是大学生，威廉姆斯显然有时向他们支付免费食物和对认股权的承诺。或者，也许是，一些员工建议，他更愿意保留未完成的软件。</p><p> “There’s glitches and glitches and glitches, but he didn’t want it to work. He wanted it to stay almost done, to raise more money from investors,” one senior-level employee believes. “I told people really early, ‘Listen, this is what it is. Just shut up and get paid while we’re getting paid.’”</p><p> “存在小故障，小故障和小故障，但他不希望它起作用。他希望它能保持几乎完成的状态，以从投资者那里筹集更多的资金。”一位高级员工认为。 “我很早就告诉人们，‘听着，就是这样。只需闭嘴并在我们获得付款时获得付款。’”</p><p> This was a common attitude at Oomba: grab the money hose and hold on before it all ran out. It’s almost hard to blame them. Why not try to catch some of that $35 million as it fell? I’ve done the same myself with other startups. Maybe you have, too. There’s little order or fairness in what gets funded and, of course, no justice whatsoever in who has the wealth to invest in a startup to begin with. Capitalism is capricious.</p><p> 在Oomba，这是一种普遍的态度：抓住钱管，等所有钱用完后再坚持。几乎很难怪他们。为什么不尝试在下降的那笔3500万美元中抓住一部分呢？我与其他创业公司也做过同样的事情。也许你也有。获得资金的方式几乎没有秩序或公平的，当然，对于谁有钱去投资一家初创公司，当然也没有公正可言。资本主义是反复无常的。</p><p> But how did Oomba manage to raise so much in the first place? Well, versatile tournament software is apparently a good idea and something that still hasn’t quite been done. When the company was founded in 2013, game-adjacent investments were prescient — before Twitch, the streaming platform, and Discord, the messaging service, got big. Competitive video game play, or esports, was taking off as a spectator sport in Asia. And of course, Williams is a white man who was trying to raise capital in the era of peak startup, a six-year period when the total amount invested by venture capital firms more than tripled: from $41.3 billion in 2012 to $140.2 billion in 2018.</p><p> 但是Oomba首先如何筹集这么多钱？嗯，多功能比赛软件显然是个好主意，但还没有完成。当公司于2013年成立时，与游戏相邻的投资是有先见之明的-在流媒体平台Twitch和消息传递服务Discord兴起之前。竞争性的视频游戏或电子竞技正在作为亚洲的一项观赏性运动而兴起。当然，威廉姆斯是一位白人，他试图在创业高峰期（这是六年间风险投资公司的总投资额增加两倍）期间筹集资金：从2012年的413亿美元增加到2018年的1,402亿美元。</p><p> So the story of Oomba is also the story of the average startup: most fail. At least half go out of business within four years. That’s usually the point for people who fund early-stage software companies: riskier investments in the hopes that a few will pan out spectacularly. And with great risk comes the occasional Oomba.</p><p> 因此，Oomba的故事也是普通创业公司的故事：大多数失败。四年内至少有一半倒闭。对于那些为早期软件公司提供资金的人来说，这通常是重点：风险更大的投资，希望其中一些能够大获成功。偶然的Oomba带来了很大的风险。</p><p>   Michael Williams started raising money for Oomba in 2012 and 2013. By his side was a blond actress, Dylan Hundley, who starred in the Oscar-nominated 1990 film  Metropolitan. The unlikely duo found an audience on the East Coast when a finance guy saw the pitch deck and brought it to his golf club buddies in Connecticut.</p><p>   迈克尔·威廉姆斯（Michael Williams）于2012年和2013年开始为Oomba筹集资金。在他身边的是一位金发碧眼的女演员迪伦·汉德利（Dylan Hundley），她出演了1990年奥斯卡提名的电影《大都会》。当财务人员看到球场并将其带到他在康涅狄格州的高尔夫俱乐部时，这个不太可能的二人组在东海岸找到了观众。</p><p> “He presented it as, ‘I get pitched all the time, over a long career, and this is one of the best concepts I’ve been presented with,’” explains one friend. The finance guy said Oomba was a hundred-bagger, or maybe a thousand-bagger, meaning they’d get back a thousand times their investment. To seal the deal, Williams and Hundley came to the golf club — a lush expanse dotted with white birch and sycamores — for cocktails, hors d’oeuvres, and a Powerpoint in a private room.</p><p>一位朋友解释说：“他的陈述是，‘在长期的职业生涯中，我一直都在不断推销，这是我被介绍过的最好的概念之一。”财务负责人说，Oomba的价格是100倍甚至1000倍，这意味着他们可以获得的投资是其一千倍。为了达成协议，威廉姆斯和亨德利来到了高尔夫俱乐部-郁郁葱葱的白桦树和梧桐点缀其间-在私人房间里品尝鸡尾酒，开胃菜和Powerpoint。</p><p> “There was a lot of enthusiasm, and everyone fed off each other,” one golf club member tells me. Williams didn’t quite impress — “He was wearing a suit two sizes too big and had a hole in the bottom of his shoe,” — but Hundley made up for it: “She was a very attractive woman, and she had been in the movies.”</p><p> 一位高尔夫俱乐部成员告诉我：“热情很高，每个人都互相厌烦。”威廉姆斯并没有给人留下深刻的印象-“他穿的西装太大了两个，并且在鞋的底部有一个洞。”-但亨德利弥补了这一点：“她是一个非常有魅力的女人，她曾经在电影。”</p><p> A few years earlier, Hundley had done some consulting for Williams when he was CEO at Reality Gap. Having already spent $7 million in investor funding, he paid her using money meant for payroll taxes; as a result, the board fired him. Now here she was, helping him secure new backers.</p><p> 几年前，洪德利（Hundley）担任Reality Gap首席执行官时曾为威廉姆斯（Williams）做过一些咨询。他已经花了700万美元的投资者资金，然后用工资税的钱付给了她。结果，董事会解雇了他。现在她在这里，帮助他争取到新的支持者。</p><p> One of the investors, Paul Rotondo, agreed the golfers were smitten with Hundley and therefore with Oomba: “The fellas at the club, they’re kind of all hornbags,” he says. “Your eyes glaze over. It’s a big frickin’ dream, you find something like this.”</p><p> 其中一位投资人保罗·罗通多（Paul Rotondo）同意，高尔夫球手被洪德利（Hundley）和Oomba迷住了：“俱乐部的伙计们，他们都是喇叭袋，”他说。 “你的眼睛凝视着。这是一个伟大的弗里金梦，发现这样的事情。”</p><p> Around 20 members of the golf club invested. Several brought in family and other friends. The finance guy got his ex-wife involved. Some people didn’t have the savings necessary to be accredited investors, but Williams helped “fudge” the paperwork, as one person put it. On an early shareholders’ call, Williams announced Oomba had “tens of thousands of users,” though the real number of accounts was more like 450. Expectations were high.</p><p> 高尔夫俱乐部的大约20名成员进行了投资。几个带来了家人和其他朋友。财务人员让他的前妻参与其中。有些人没有获得合格投资者所需要的积蓄，但是威廉姆斯像一个人所说的那样帮助“弄乱了”文书工作。在早期股东的电话会议上，威廉姆斯宣布Oomba拥有“成千上万的用户”，尽管真实的帐户数量已超过450个。人们的期望很高。</p><p> Rotondo says one golf buddy “was of the opinion that our group could buy some kind of airplane that we could share” when Oomba hit it big. “He had this money spent.”</p><p> 罗通多说，一个高尔夫球友“在Oomba大放异彩时，就认为我们的团队可以购买某种我们可以共享的飞机”。 “他花了这笔钱。”</p><p>  Meanwhile, in California, a college sophomore named Tyler Hogan met Williams at a midnight  Magic: The Gathering tournament during the fall of 2013. When Williams saw his University of California, Irvine sweatshirt and learned Hogan was studying computer science, he offered him an internship on the spot. Hogan is pale and towheaded, with soft features and trusting blue eyes. He was intrigued. “What’s the worst that could happen? I’m just getting experience,” he said. That spring, Hogan brought Williams to his video game development club at UCI. At least four additional students got hired. For a while, this was Oomba’s entire engineering team.</p><p>  同时，在加利福尼亚，一位名叫泰勒·霍根（Tyler Hogan）的大学二年级学生在2013年秋季的午夜魔术：聚会聚会上遇到了威廉姆斯。当威廉姆斯看到他的加利福尼亚大学欧文运动衫并得知霍根正在学习计算机科学时，他提供了实习机会。当场。霍根（Hogan）脸色苍白，头昏眼花，有着柔软的特征和令人信任的蓝眼睛。他很感兴趣。 “可能发生的最坏情况是什么？我只是获得经验，”他说。那年春天，霍根（Hogan）将威廉姆斯（Williams）带到他在UCI的视频游戏开发俱乐部。至少还招募了四名学生。有一阵子，这是Oomba的整个工程团队。</p><p> The college kids came in on evenings and weekends, even pulling all-nighters at the office. But Williams seemed determined to distract them. He insisted on adding streaming, stretching resources to form OombaTV. He set up promotional tournaments before the software was ready, announcing after one that over 200,000 people had watched — Google Analytics only showed 1,995 viewers.</p><p>大学的孩子们晚上和周末都来了，甚至整夜都在办公室里过夜。但是威廉姆斯似乎决心分散他们的注意力。他坚持要添加流媒体，扩展资源以形成OombaTV。他在软件准备就绪之前就举办了宣传比赛，并宣布了超过200,000人观看过的比赛-Google Analytics（分析）仅显示1,995位观众。</p><p> “It was always like, ‘Oh, quickly add this one fix in to make the tournament work for this weekend!’” Hogan says. “We were never taking the time to think through how this would work for hundreds of thousands of people at the same time.”</p><p> 霍根说：“一直以来，‘哦，赶快添加此修复程序，以使本周末比赛能够正常进行！” “我们从来没有花时间去思考如何同时为成千上万的人工作。”</p><p> As simple as digital brackets may sound, not all tournaments look like March Madness. Complications arise around scoring, teams, and elimination. But Oomba apparently ignored the tech dictum to design at scale. The company spent years writing code tailored to whatever kind of tournament it would be running next, without ever achieving a universal solution that could be customized.</p><p> 听起来似乎很简单，但并非所有比赛都像疯狂三月。得分，团队和淘汰会带来麻烦。但是Oomba显然忽略了大规模设计的技术准则。该公司花了多年的时间编写适合于接下来将要举办的任何比赛的代码，而从未实现可以定制的通用解决方案。</p><p> “I never did quite understand what he was trying to do, other than trying to make money off the investors”</p><p> “除了试图从投资者那里赚钱以外，我从来没有完全理解他的努力”</p><p> The limits of this strategy became clear by August 2014 when Oomba debuted at Gen Con, the annual 60,000-person gathering focused on “tabletop games,” meaning roleplaying games (like  Dungeons and Dragons), collectable card games (like  Pokémon), and board games (like Clue). These are the games that Williams loves, but they were not the priority of investors. Tabletop has grown in the past decade — driven by megahits like Cards Against Humanity and Catan — and in 2018, the category brought in $11.95 billion worldwide. But that same year, video games made over ten times more: $138.7 billion.</p><p> 到2014年8月，Oomba在Gen Con上首次亮相时，这种策略的局限性变得清晰起来。GenCon是每年60,000人的聚会，专注于“桌上游戏”，这意味着角色扮演游戏（例如《地下城与龙》），可收藏的纸牌游戏（例如《神奇宝贝》）和棋盘游戏游戏（例如线索）。这些是威廉姆斯喜欢的游戏，但它们并不是投资者的优先考虑。在过去的十年中，桌面游戏的增长是由诸如Cards Against Humanity和Catan之类的大热门推动的，到2018年，该类别在全球范围内带来了119.5亿美元的收入。但是在同一年，视频游戏的收入却增长了十倍以上：1387亿美元。</p><p> At Gen Con 2014, Oomba was supposed to run a Catan tournament and a Guinness World Record-setting tournament of rock, paper, scissors. It was chaos.</p><p> 在2014年Gen Con上，Oomba本应举办一次Catan锦标赛和一个由石头，纸，剪刀组成的吉尼斯世界纪录锦标赛。太混乱了。</p><p> “Everybody was just at the edge of their wits, super stressed, not getting enough sleep,” Hogan recalls. “The software was like half running it, but it was kind of falling over in a lot of places.”</p><p> 霍根回忆说：“每个人都处于机智的边缘，压力很大，睡眠不足。” “该软件只运行了一半，但在很多地方都掉了下来。”</p><p>  Larry Roznai, who was in charge of Catan as the president of Mayfair Games, says that in spite of months of promises, Oomba’s software couldn’t handle a Catan tournament. “At the end of the day, there was nothing functional behind it,” he tells me, adding that Mayfair never paid Williams a cent. “I never did quite understand what he was trying to do, other than trying to make money off the investors.”</p><p>负责加坦（Catan）梅菲尔游戏公司（Mayfair Games）总裁的拉里·罗兹奈（Larry Roznai）说，尽管有数月的承诺，但Oomba的软件无法处理加坦锦标赛。他告诉我：“归根结底，没有任何功能可言。”他补充说，梅菲尔从未向威廉姆斯支付一分钱。 “除了试图从投资者那里赚钱以外，我从来没有完全理解他在做什么。”</p><p>   After Gen Con, Williams decided he wanted a place where Oomba could host tournaments, and he chose two storefronts — one for tabletop and one for video games — in the Laguna Hills Mall, a cursed-feeling place that was set to close in a few years. Rent was cheap. Foot traffic was low.</p><p>   在Gen Con之后，威廉姆斯决定在Oomba举办比赛的地方，他在拉古纳山购物中心（Laguna Hills Mall）中选择了两个店面-一个用于桌面，一个用于视频游戏，这是一个被诅咒的地方，将在几个地方关闭年份。租金便宜。人流量低。</p><p> One afternoon, the team returned to the office to find someone changing the locks. So Oomba’s employees relocated everything to a cinder-brick storage space at the mall.</p><p> 一天下午，团队返回办公室，发现有人在换锁。因此，Oomba的员工将所有物品都转移到了商场中煤渣砖的存储空间中。</p><p> For about a year, this was Oomba’s home base. In the winter, it got so cold that Hogan wore his furry snowboarding jacket and kept a space heater under his desk. The demand from heaters and computers sometimes overloaded the circuits, cutting power to the room and sending everyone home. Many of the employees quit. Those who stayed were mostly in college and didn’t need the money — seeing as paychecks rarely came. “It would be like, ‘Hey, it’s Friday, let’s go to Buffalo Wild Wings!’, and we’d know intuitively that means we’re not getting a paycheck today,” Hogan says.</p><p> 大约一年来，这是Oomba的总部。冬天，天气如此寒冷，霍根穿上了他那毛茸茸的滑雪板外套，并在桌子下面放了一个取暖器。取暖器和计算机的需求有时会使电路过载，从而切断房间电源并把所有人送回家。许多员工辞职了。那些留下来的人大多是上大学，不需要钱-看到很少有薪水来。霍根说：“就像，‘嘿，今天是星期五，我们去布法罗野生之翼！’，我们凭直觉知道这意味着我们今天没有薪水。”</p><p> On the other side of the cinder bricks, Yelp reviewers complained the esports-oriented Oomba Lounge was disorganized, with rude staff and computers that often broke. “Do NOT take your kids here,” wrote Rainbow K. in July 2015. “They only want to take your money.”</p><p> 在煤渣砖的另一侧，Yelp的评论者抱怨说，面向电子竞技的Oomba Lounge杂乱无章，工作人员和计算机经常失灵。 Rainbow K.在2015年7月写道：“不要带你的孩子来。他们只想拿你的钱。”</p><p> Williams emailed investors that fall, asking for more funding and saying deals with Hasbro,  Rock Band, and the South By Southwest festival were in the works. “We are talking about a global RISKⓇ tournament! 12 year-old Mike is loving this!!” he wrote.</p><p> 威廉姆斯在秋天给投资者发了电子邮件，要求更多的资金，并说与孩之宝，摇滚乐队和South By Southwest音乐节的交易正在进行中。 “我们正在谈论全球RISKⓇ比赛！ 12岁的Mike喜欢这个！！”他写了。</p><p> But as the months wore on, the folks in Connecticut grew antsy. Williams and Hundley, who was living in New York, kept calling the golf club members looking for more money each quarter: $20,000 here, $23,000 there. “He knew the people who invested a lot, we were the ones with the most liability, so we would invest more,” one golf club member tells me.</p><p> 但是随着时间的流逝，康涅狄格州的人们变得越来越热闹。住在纽约的威廉姆斯和亨德利一直打电话给高尔夫俱乐部的成员，他们每个季度都在寻找更多的钱：这里20,000美元，那里23,000美元。 “他知道投资很多的人，我们是负债最多的人，所以我们会投资更多，”一位高尔夫俱乐部成员告诉我。</p><p> With all this financing, Williams didn’t seem to care about revenue, let alone profit. “He truly does not have any idea at all about the value of the dollar,” claims one person who has worked with Williams on and off. “He spends money whether he has it or not.”</p><p>有了所有这些融资，威廉姆斯似乎并不在乎收入，更不用说利润了。一位曾经和威廉姆斯断断续续地工作过的人说：“他对美元的价值真的根本一无所知。” “不管有没有钱，他都会花钱。”</p><p>  So in early 2016, Williams started looking into buying a chain of restaurant-arcades called GameWorks. GameWorks began in the late ‘90s as a joint venture between DreamWorks, Sega, and Universal Studios, with input from Steven Spielberg. Much had changed since then, including a few bankruptcies and restructurings. At his first meeting with GameWorks’ chairman Howard Brand, over lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan Beach, Williams wore a black-and-white striped referee’s jacket.</p><p>  因此，在2016年初，威廉姆斯（Williams）开始研究购买名为GameWorks的一系列餐厅商场。 GameWorks始于90年代后期，是DreamWorks，Sega和Universal Studios的合资企业，得到了Steven Spielberg的大力支持。从那时起，发生了许多变化，包括一些破产和重组。在与GameWorks董事长霍华德·布兰德（Howard Brand）的第一次会面中，威廉姆斯在曼哈顿海滩的一家中餐馆吃午饭，穿着黑白条纹的裁判外套。</p><p> “I thought he was a little eccentric. Typically when I go to these meetings I’m dressed pretty nice,” Brand says. “From my point of view, I didn’t really care, as long as he paid the price.”</p><p> “我以为他有点古怪。通常，当我参加这些会议时，我穿得很漂亮。”布兰德说。 “从我的角度来看，只要他付了价，我就不在乎。”</p><p> Howard Brand looks like George Costanza from  Seinfeld but has serious business acumen — the kind of guy who flips companies in trucking, health care, and scrap metal recycling. He led the purchase of GameWorks from Sega in 2011 and began learning the complexities of the family entertainment center space. “There’s so many parts to it that you have to know: gaming, party, food and beverage,” Brand explains.</p><p> 霍华德·布兰德（Howard Brand）看起来像塞因费尔德（Seinfeld）的乔治·科斯坦扎（George Costanza），但具有敏锐的商业头脑—那种在卡车运输，医疗保健和废旧金属回收方面翻转公司的人。他于2011年领导从世嘉公司收购GameWorks，并开始学习家庭娱乐中心空间的复杂性。布兰德解释说：“您必须了解很多部分：游戏，聚会，食物和饮料。”</p><p> His son, an enterprising gamer named Michael, was finishing college and convinced his father that GameWorks should get in early on esports. Howard was skeptical but allowed the younger Brand to build out dedicated esports lounges in three of GameWorks’ eight locations, where he began hosting video game tournaments that attracted several hundred players and spectators.</p><p> 他的儿子是一个富有进取心的游戏玩家，名为Michael，正在读完大学，并说服了父亲父亲GameWorks应该早日参加电子竞技。霍华德对此表示怀疑，但允许年轻的布兰德在GameWorks的八个地点中的三个地点建立专用的电子竞技休息室，在那里他开始举办视频游戏比赛，吸引了数百名玩家和观众。</p><p> “People would line up in the heat to come in. It was amazing. I didn’t realize how big it was,” Howard says with pride.</p><p> “人们会在热浪中排队。这真是太神奇了。我没有意识到它有多大。”霍华德自豪地说道。</p><p>  This was where Oomba would come in. “If you have software to automate the process, it would improve the experience for the average gamer,” Michael Brand says. Williams put in an offer to buy GameWorks, and he and Howard negotiated a deal. But Williams didn’t deliver the money.</p><p>  这就是Oomba的用武之地。“如果您有自动化该过程的软件，它将为普通游戏玩家带来更好的体验，”迈克尔·布兰德（Michael Brand）说。威廉姆斯提出要约收购GameWorks，他和霍华德达成了交易。但是威廉姆斯没有交付这笔钱。</p><p> “We gave Mike Williams four or five months,” Howard says, and he couldn’t come up with anything more than a few nonrefundable deposits.</p><p>霍华德说：“我们给了迈克·威廉姆斯四个或五个月的时间。”他除了拿出一些不可退还的存款外，什么也没想。</p><p> “My mentality was, it’s not going to happen,” Michael Brand says. You can’t pay for a company with enthusiasm. Silly costumes aside, if Williams was the kind of guy who had no follow-through, then that wasn’t going to change, no matter how many extensions he got.</p><p> “我的想法是，这不会发生，”迈克尔·布兰德（Michael Brand）说。您无法为一家热情的公司付费。除了笨拙的服装，如果威廉姆斯是那种没有后续行动的人，那么无论他得到多少扩展，这都不会改变。</p><p>   By the time Ronnie started at Oomba, in the late summer of 2016, the company had around two dozen employees spread across a two-story building in a low-slung office park with glass-walled conference rooms, a kitchen, and even a shower. Williams spent thousands on height-adjustable desks but sometimes didn’t pay the company’s health insurance bill; an employee once called a doctor’s office to schedule an appointment only to discover the policy was inactive.</p><p>   当罗尼（Ronnie）于2016年夏末开始在Oomba开业时，该公司已经有大约二十名员工分布在一座低矮的办公园区的一栋两层楼建筑中，那里设有玻璃墙会议室，厨房，甚至还有淋浴间。威廉姆斯在可调高度的桌子上花费了数千美元，但有时没有支付公司的健康保险费用；某位员工曾经打电话给医生办公室安排约会，只是发现该政策无效。</p><p> “I got my first paycheck when I was supposed to get my second, and I got my second when I wa</p><p> “我本应该拿到第二张薪水的，而我刚拿到第二张薪水的，</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/21571690/oomba-startup-work-environment-sex-lies-video-games-gameworks-exworks">https://www.theverge.com/21571690/oomba-startup-work-environment-sex-lies-video-games-gameworks-exworks</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/启动/">#启动</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/startup/">#startup</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/oomba/">#oomba</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
