At 11,600 years old, this mountaintop archaeological site has been described as the world’s oldest temple — so ancient, in fact, that its T-shaped pillars and circular enclosures pre-date pottery in the Middle East.</p><p>在一个晴朗的一天，Göbekli的废墟的看法一直延伸到土耳其南部，一路距离叙利亚边境约有50公里。这个山顶考古遗址在11600岁时被描述为世界上最古老的寺庙 - 这么古老，其实于其T形支柱和圆形围栏在中东地区的陶器。</p><p> The people who built these monumental structures were living just before a major transition in human history: the Neolithic revolution, when humans began farming and domesticating crops and animals. But there are no signs of domesticated grain at Göbekli Tepe, suggesting that its residents hadn’t yet made the leap to farming. The ample animal bones found in the ruins prove that the people living there were accomplished hunters, and there are signs of massive feasts. Archaeologists have suggested that mobile bands of hunter-gatherers from all across the region came together at times for huge barbecues, and that these meaty feasts led them to build the impressive stone structures.</p><p> 建造这些巨大结构的人在人类历史的重大过渡之前生活：新石器时代的革命，当人类开始耕种和驯养作物和动物时。但GöbekliTEPE没有驯化粮食的迹象，这表明其居民尚未成为农业的飞跃。在废墟中发现的充足的动物骨骼证明了生活在那里的人们已经完成了猎人，并且有大量盛宴的迹象。考古学家建议猎人 - 采集者的移动乐队有时会在一起举起巨大的烧烤，并且这些肉美的盛宴导致他们建立令人印象深刻的石结构。</p><p> Now that view is changing, thanks to researchers such as Laura Dietrich at the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. Over the past four years, Dietrich has discovered that the people who built these ancient structures were fuelled by vat-fulls of porridge and stew, made from grain that the ancient residents had ground and processed on an almost industrial scale  1. The clues from Göbekli Tepe reveal that ancient humans relied on grains much earlier than was previously thought — even before there is evidence that these plants were domesticated. And Dietrich’s work is part of a growing movement to take a closer look at the role that grains and other starches had in the diet of people in the past.</p><p> 现在，这种观点正在改变，感谢柏林德国考古学研究所的Laura Dietrich等研究人员。在过去四年中，饮食丛已经发现，由古代居民在几乎工业规模地处理和处理的谷物制造的葡萄干和炖斯坦制造了这些古老结构的人被推动。来自Göbekli的线索TEPE揭示了古代人类依赖于比以前思想的比例更早 - 甚至在有证据表明这些植物驯化了这些植物之前。而饮食中的作品是越来越多的运动的一部分，仔细观察谷物和其他淀粉在过去饮食中的作用。</p><p> The researchers are using a wide range of techniques — from examining microscopic marks on ancient tools to analysing DNA residues inside pots. Some investigators are even experimentally recreating 12,000-year-old meals using methods from that time. Looking even further back, evidence suggests that some people ate starchy plants more than 100,000 years ago. Taken together, these discoveries shred the long-standing idea that early people subsisted mainly on meat — a view that has fuelled support for the palaeo diet, popular in the United States and elsewhere, which recommends avoiding grains and other starches.</p><p> 研究人员正在采用各种技术 - 从古代工具上检查微观标记分析盆内DNA残留物。一些调查员甚至甚至在实验上使用当时的方法重新创建12,000岁的膳食。甚至看起来更进一步，证据表明有些人超过10万人吃淀粉植物。这些发现在一起，这些发现是长期以来的想法，即早期人民主要在肉类上染成肉类 - 这一观点，这一观点是促进了帕拉诺饮食，在美国和其他地方受欢迎，推荐避免谷物和其他淀粉。</p><p> The new work fills a big hole in the understanding of the types of food that made up ancient diets. “We’re reaching a critical mass of material to realize there’s a new category we’ve been missing,” says Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanist at University College London.</p><p> 新工作填补了一个大洞，了解古代饮食的食物类型。 “我们致力于实现一系列的重要材料，以实现我们缺失的新类别，”伦敦大学大学大学议员的大学富勒说。</p><p>  Dietrich’s discoveries about the feasts at Göbekli Tepe started in the site’s ‘rock garden’. That’s the name archaeologists dismissively gave a nearby field where they dumped basalt grinding stones, limestone troughs and other large pieces of worked stone found amid the rubble.</p><p>  Dietrich在GöbekliTepe的盛宴开始于该网站的“岩石花园”。这就是考古学家的名字，在瓦砾中发现了玄武岩磨石，石灰石槽和其他大块工作的石头，在那里倾倒了附近的领域。</p><p> As excavations continued over the past two decades, the collection of grinding stones quietly grew, says Dietrich. “Nobody thought about them.” When she started cataloguing them in 2016, she was stunned at the sheer numbers. The ‘garden’ covered an area the size of a football field, and contained more than 10,000 grinding stones and nearly 650 carved stone platters and vessels, some big enough to hold up to 200 litres of liquid.</p><p> 迪蒂希说，由于过去二十年来挖掘持续的挖掘，磨石的集合悄然成长。 “没有人想到他们。”当她开始在2016年开始编目时，她被纯粹的数字惊呆了。 “花园”覆盖了足球场大小的区域，并包含了超过10,000个磨石，近650架雕刻石板和船舶，足以容纳200升液体。 </p><p>  “No other settlement in the Near East has so many grinding stones, even in the late Neolithic, when agriculture was already well-established,” Dietrich says. “And they have a whole spectrum of stone pots, in every thinkable size. Why so many stone vessels?” She suspected that they were for grinding grain to produce porridge and beer. Archaeologists had long argued that stone vats at the site were evidence of occasional ceremonial beer consumption at Göbekli Tepe, but thought of it as a rare treat.</p><p>“在近东的其他解决方案都有这么多的磨石，即使在新石器时间的晚期，农业已经很好地建立，”Dietrich说。 “他们在每一个思想的大小都有整个石头盆。为什么这么多石船？“她怀疑他们是用于磨粒生产粥和啤酒。考古学家长期以来，该网站的石头大桶是偶尔在Göbekli·泰普偶尔的仪式啤酒消费的证据，但它将其视为一种罕见的享受。</p><p> Teasing answers from the stones there and at other sites is not a simple process. In archaeology, it is much easier to spot evidence of meat meals than ones based on grains or other plants. That’s because the bones of butchered animals fossilize much more readily than do the remains of a vegetarian feast. The fragile nature of ancient plant remains makes archaeobotany — the study of how ancient people used plants — tricky, time-consuming work. Researchers use sieves, fine mesh and buckets to wash and separate debris from archaeological sites. Tiny bits of organic material such as seeds, charred wood and burnt food float to the top, while heavier dirt and rocks sink.</p><p> 从那里的石头和其他网站的戏弄答案不是一个简单的过程。在考古学中，在基于谷物或其他植物的肉食的证据更容易发现肉类餐的证据。这是因为屠宰的动物的骨头比素食盛宴的遗体更容易僵化。古代植物的脆弱性仍然是archaeobotany  - 对古代人民使用植物的研究 - 棘手，耗时的工作。研究人员使用筛子，细网和铲斗从考古遗址清洗和分开碎片。微小的有机材料如种子，烧焦木材和烧焦的食物漂浮在顶部，而较重的污垢和岩石水槽。</p><p> The vast majority of what emerges amounts to the raw ingredients, the bits that never made it into a pot. By identifying and counting grass seeds, grain kernels and grape pips mixed into the soil, archaeobotanists can tell what was growing in the area around the settlement. Unusual amounts of any given species offer circumstantial evidence that those plants might have been used, and perhaps cultivated, by people in the past.</p><p> 绝大多数出现的是原料的成分，从来没有把它变成锅的比特。通过识别和计数草种子，谷物仁和葡萄馅在混合到土壤中，古代裔人可以在解决方面讲述该地区的日益增长。任何给定的物种的不寻常数量提供的间接证据表明这些植物可能已经使用，也许是过去的人培养。</p><p>  Some of the earliest evidence for plant domestication, for example, comes from einkorn wheat grains recovered from a site near Göbekli Tepe that are subtly different in shape and genetics from wild varieties  2. At Göbekli Tepe itself, the grains look wild, suggesting that domestication hadn’t taken place or was in its earliest stages. (Archaeologists suspect that it might have taken centuries for domestication to alter the shape of grains.)</p><p>  例如，植物驯化的一些最早的证据来自来自野生品种的Göbekli矿床附近的位点上回收的einkorn小麦籽粒2.在Göbekli本身，谷物看起来狂野，暗示驯化没有发生或在最早的阶段发生。 （考古学家怀疑它可能已经为驯化了几个世纪的驯化来改变谷物的形状。）</p><p> Direct proof that plants landed in cooking pots is harder to come by. To work out what people were eating, archaeologists are turning to previously ignored sources of evidence, such as charred bits of food. They’re the mistakes of the past: stews and porridge left on the fire for too long, or bits of bread dropped in the hearth or burnt in the oven. “Anyone who’s cooked a meal knows sometimes it burns,” says Lucy Kubiak-Martens, an archaeobotanist working for BIAX Consult Biological Archaeology &amp; Environmental Reconstruction in Zaandam, the Netherlands.</p><p> 直接证明植物落在烹饪盆中是艰难的。为了解决人们在吃东西，考古学家正在转向以前忽视的证据来源，例如烧焦的食物。他们是过去的错误：炖菜和粥在火上留下太长，或者在炉子里摔倒了一滴面包或烧烤。 “那些熟食饭的人有时会燃烧，”露西库布克 - 马登（Biax Consult Biological Archeology＆Amp）露西Kubiak-Martens说，“Lucy Kubiak-Martens说。荷兰Zaandam的环境重建。</p><p> Until the past few years, these hard-to-analyse remnants of ruined meals were rarely given a second look. “It’s just a difficult material. It’s fragile, ugly stuff,” says Andreas Heiss, an archaeobotanist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. “Most researchers just shied away.” Pottery sherds encrusted with food remains were cleaned off or discarded as ‘crud ware’, and charred bits of food were dismissed as unanalysable ‘probable food’ and shelved or thrown out.</p><p> 直到过去几年，这些难以分析的毁灭饭的残余物很少给予第二次外观。 “这只是一件难以的材料。它是脆弱的，丑陋的东西，“维也纳科学院的古老博物馆andreas heiss说。 “大多数研究人员都避开了。”用食物覆盖的陶器仍然被清除或被丢弃为“Crud Ware”，并且被烧焦的食物被驳回为不平衡的“可能的食物”并搁置或抛弃。</p><p> The first step towards changing that perception was to go back to the kitchen. That was the inspiration of Soultana Valamoti, an archaeobotanist at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece who, not coincidentally, is also a passionate home cook. Valamoti spent the early years of her career toting buckets and sieves from one excavation site to another across Greece, all while combing museum storerooms for ancient plant remains to analyse. The work convinced her there was an untapped wealth of evidence in burnt food remains — if she could find a way to identify what she was looking at.</p><p> 改变这种感知的第一步是回到厨房。这是灵魂的灵魂，这是一位在希腊塞萨洛尼基大学的aristotle大学的arikaeobotanist的灵感，谁不巧合，也是一个充满激情的家庭厨师。 Valamoti在她的职业生涯的职业生涯休息和筛片中从一个挖掘网站到另一个穿越希腊，同时梳理博物馆的古代植物仍然分析。这项工作确信她有一个彻底的丰富伯恩遗骸的证据遗骸 - 如果她能找到一种确定她在看的东西的方法。 </p><p> More than 20 years ago, Valamoti decided to turn her lab into an experimental kitchen. She ground and boiled wheat to make bulgur, and then charred it in an oven to simulate a long-ago cooking accident (see ‘Fast food of the Bronze Age’). By comparing the burnt remains to 4,000-year-old samples from a site in northern Greece, she was able to show that the ancient and modern versions matched, and that this way of preparing grain had its roots in the Bronze Age  3.</p><p>超过20年前，瓦莫蒂决定将她的实验室转变为一个实验厨房。她地磨碎了小麦来制作碾碎机，然后在烤箱里烧焦它来模拟一场长期烹饪事故（见'青铜时代的快餐）。通过将烧焦的遗骸与希腊北部的一家位点的比较，她能够表明古老和现代版本匹配，这种准备谷物的方式在青铜年龄3时左右。</p><p>  Over the decade that followed, she continued experimenting. Beginning in 2016, a European Research Council grant allowed her to create a crusty, charred reference collection of more than 300 types of ancient and experimental samples. After making bread dough, baked bread, porridge, bulgur and a traditional food called trachana from heirloom wheat and barley, Valamoti chars each sample in an oven under controlled conditions.</p><p>  在这十年之后，她继续尝试。从2016年开始，一名欧洲研究委员会的格兰特允许她创造一个古代和实验样本的300多种类型的烧结焦点。在制作面团，烤面包，粥，碾碎性和传统的食物中，叫做Trachana，从传赛鸽小麦和大麦，valamoti在受控条件下烤箱中的每个样品。</p><p> She than magnifies the crispy results by 750 to 1,000 times to identify the tell-tale changes in cell structure caused by different cooking processes. Whether boiled or fresh, ground or whole, dried or soaked, the grains all look different at high magnification. Baking bread leaves tell-tale bubbles behind, for example, whereas boiling grain before charring it gelatinizes the starch, Valamoti says. “And we can see all that under the scanning electron microscope.”</p><p> 她比将脆皮结果放大750至1000次，以确定不同烹饪过程引起的细胞结构的讲述变化。无论是煮沸还是新鲜，地面或全部，干燥或浸泡，谷物都看起来不同。例如，烘烤面包叶子留下的背后泡泡泡泡泡沫烧结谷物，在搅拌之前它会凝胶化淀粉，瓦洛莫说。 “我们可以在扫描电子显微镜下看到所有这些。”</p><p>  Comparing the ancient samples with her modern experiments, Valamoti has been able to go beyond identifying plant species to reconstruct the cooking methods and dishes of ancient Greece. There is evidence that people in the region have been eating bulgur for at least 4,000 years  4. By boiling barley or wheat and then drying it for storage and quick rehydration later, “you could process the harvest in bulk and take advantage of the hot sun”, Valamoti says. “Then you can use it throughout the year. It was the fast food of the past.”</p><p>  将古代样品与现代实验进行比较，瓦洛莫能够超越鉴定植物物种，以重建古希腊的烹饪方法和盘子。有证据表明，该地区的人们一直在4000年40年代碾碎。通过沸腾大麦或小麦然后将其烘干以便储存和快速补液后，“你可以在散装中加工收获并利用炎热的太阳“瓦莫蒂说。 “那么你可以全年使用它。这是过去的快餐。“</p><p> Other researchers are also pursuing ancient cooking mistakes. Charred food remains “are providing us with direct evidence of food”, says Amaia Arranz-Otaegui, an archaeobotanist at the Paris Museum of Natural History. “That’s revolutionary. It’s an unprecedented source of information.”</p><p> 其他研究人员也在追求古老的烹饪错误。 Amaia Arranz-Otaegui，Amaia Arranz-Otaegui是巴黎自然历史博物馆的古代议会博物馆的古代议员。 “那是革命性的。这是一个前所未有的信息来源。“</p><p> In the past, it has been difficult for researchers to find hard evidence that our distant ancestors ate plants. “We’ve always suspected starch was in the diet of early hominins and early  Homo sapiens, but we didn’t have the evidence,” says Kubiak-Martens.</p><p> 在过去，研究人员难以找到我们遥远的祖先吃植物的硬证据。 “我们总是怀疑淀粉是早期的母素和早期同性恋的饮食，但我们没有证据，”Kubiak-Martens说。</p><p> Genetic data support the idea that people were eating starch. In 2016, for example, geneticists reported  5 that humans have more copies of the gene that produces enzymes to digest starch than do any of our primate relatives. “Humans have up to 20 copies, and chimpanzees have 2,” says Cynthia Larbey, an archaeobotanist at the University of Cambridge, UK. That genetic change in the human lineage helped to shape the diet of our ancestors, and now us. “That suggests there’s a selective advantage to higher-starch diets for  Homo sapiens.”</p><p> 遗传数据支持人们吃淀粉的想法。例如，在2016年，遗传学家报告了5，人类有更多的基因拷贝，这些基因产生酶的酶，而不是我们的所有灵长类动物亲属。 “人类最多有20份，黑猩猩有2个，”剑桥大学英国大学的古代议员·斯诺斯·洛贝斯说。人类谱系的遗传变化有助于塑造我们祖先的饮食，现在我们。 “这表明对Homo Sapiens的更高淀粉饮食有一种选择性的优势。” </p><p>  To find supporting evidence in the archaeological record, Larbey turned to cooking hearths at sites in South Africa dating back 120,000 years, picking out chunks of charred plant material — some the size of a peanut. Under the scanning electron microscope, she identified cellular tissue from starchy plants  6 — the earliest evidence of ancient people cooking starch. “Right through from 120,000 to 65,000 years ago, they’re cooking roots and tubers,” Larbey says. The evidence is remarkably consistent, she adds, particularly compared with animal remains from the same site. “Over time they change hunting techniques and strategies, but still continue to cook and eat plants.”</p><p>为了找到考古记录的支持证据，Larbey转向南非的景点的炉膛，约会120,000年，挑选出烧焦植物材料的大块 - 花生的一些大小。在扫描电子显微镜下，她鉴定了淀粉植物6的细胞组织 - 最早的烹饪淀粉的证据。 “从120,000到65,000年前，他们正在烹饪根和块茎，”洛贝斯说。她补充说，证据非常一致，她补充说，与动物仍然来自同一地点。 “随着时间的推移，他们改变狩猎技术和策略，但仍然继续烹饪和吃植物。”</p><p> Early humans probably ate a balanced diet, leaning on starchy plants for calories when game was scarce or hard to hunt. “And being able to find carbohydrates as they moved into new ecologies would have provided important staple foods,” Larbey adds.</p><p> 早期人类可能吃了均衡的饮食，当游戏稀缺或难以打猎时，靠在淀粉植物上。 “并且能够找到碳水化合物，因为他们进入新的生态物时会提供重要的主食，”洛布斯补充说。</p><p> Evidence suggests that plants were popular among Neanderthals, too. In 2011, Amanda Henry, a palaeoanthropologist now at Leiden University in the Netherlands, published her findings from dental plaque picked from the teeth of Neanderthals who were buried in Iran and Belgium between 46,000 and 40,000 years ago. Plant microfossils trapped and preserved in the hardened plaque showed that they were cooking and eating starchy foods including tubers, grains and dates  7. “Plants are ubiquitous in our environment,” Henry says, “and it’s no surprise we put them to use.”</p><p> 证据表明，植物在尼安德特人中也受欢迎。 2011年，一位古生专家专家学家阿曼达亨利在荷兰莱登大学出版了她从牙齿斑点的发现，从尼安德特人的牙齿挑选，他在46,000到40,000年前埋葬在伊朗和比利时。植物微基捕获并保存在硬化的斑块中，显示它们正在烹饪和吃淀粉食品，包括块茎，谷物和日期7.“植物在我们的环境中普遍存在，”亨利说，“我们毫不奇怪，我们把它们搞定了。”</p><p>  In May, Christina Warinner, a palaeogeneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her colleagues reported the extraction of bacterial DNA from the dental plaque of Neanderthals, including a 100,000-year-old individual from what is now Serbia. The species they found included some that specialized in breaking down starch into sugars, supporting the idea that Neanderthals had already adapted to a plant-rich diet  8. Plaque on the teeth of early modern humans shared a similar bacterial profile, providing more evidence to suggest that they were eating starchy plants.</p><p>  5月，May，Massachides的哈佛大学古生公司Christina Warinner和她的同事们报告了从尼安德特人的牙科牌匾中提取细菌DNA，其中包括现在塞尔维亚的100,000岁的个人。他们发现的物种包括一些专门脱落成糖的物种，支持Neanderthals已经适应了富有植物的饮食8.斑块在早期现代人类的牙齿上分享了类似的细菌性概况，提供了更多的证据表明他们正在吃淀粉植物。</p><p> The finds push back against the idea that our ancestors spent their time sitting around campfires mostly chewing on mammoth steaks. It’s an idea that has penetrated popular culture, with proponents of the palaeo diet arguing that grains, potatoes and other starchy foods have no place on our plates because our hunter-gatherer ancestors didn’t evolve to eat them.</p><p> 发现推迟了我们的祖先在篝火旁的时间坐在篝火旁的想法上。这是一个穿透流行文化的想法，具有古玩的Palaeo饮食的支持者，争论谷物，土豆和其他淀粉食品在我们的盘子上没有地方，因为我们的猎人收集者祖先并没有进化吃它们。</p><p> But it has become clear that early humans were cooking and eating carbs almost as soon as they could light fires. “The old-fashioned idea that hunter-gatherers didn’t eat starch is nonsense,” says Fuller.</p><p> 但很明显，早些时候人类几乎一旦亮起，就会尽快烹饪和吃碳水化合物。 “猎人 - 采集者没有吃淀粉的老式的想法是废话，”富勒说。</p><p>  The push to better understand how people were cooking in the past also means paying more attention to the cooks themselves. It’s part of a larger trend in archaeology to look at household activities and daily lives. “Essentially, we’re trying to figure out what kind of information you can find out about people who have never had histories written about them,” says Sarah Graff, an archaeologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.</p><p>  推动更好地了解过去人们在过去的烹饪方面也意味着更多地关注自己的厨师。这是考古学趋势的一部分，以查看家庭活动和日常生活。 “基本上，我们正试图弄清楚你可以了解从未有过关于他们的历史的人可以了解什么样的信息，”斯坦加的亚利桑那州立大学考古学家Sarah Graff说。 </p><p> In the past, when researchers found plant remains at archaeological sites, they often considered them as accidental ‘ecofacts’ — natural objects, such as seeds, pollen and burnt wood, that offer evidence for what kind of plants grew in a region. But there has been a shift towards treating food remains as evidence of an activity that required craft, intent and skill. “Prepared food needs to be looked at as an artefact first and a species second,” Fuller says. “Heated, fermented, soaked — making food is akin to making a ceramic vessel.”</p><p>过去，当研究人员发现植物仍然在考古地点时，他们经常认为它们是偶然的“生物造法” - 自然物体，如种子，花粉和烧焦的木材，为一个地区种植的植物提供了证据。但是，朝向治疗食物的转变仍然是需要工艺，意图和技能的活动的证据。 “准备好的食物需要先作为一个人工制品和一个物种，”富勒说。 “加热，发酵，浸湿的食物类似于制造陶瓷血管。”</p><p>  And, as researchers increasingly collaborate to compare ancient remains, they’re finding remarkable similarities across time and cultures. At Neolithic sites in Austria dating back more than 5,000 years, for example, archaeologists found unusually shaped charred crusts. It was as though the contents of a large jar or pot had been heated until the liquid burned off, and the dried crust inside began to burn. The team’s first guess was that the crusts were from grain storage jars destroyed in a fire. But under the scanning electron microscope, the cell walls of individual grains looked unusually thin — a sign, Heiss says, that something else was going on.</p><p>  而且，随着研究人员越来越努力比较古老的遗体，他们在时间和文化中发现了显着的相似之处。在奥地利的新石器时代地点约会超过5000年，例如，考古学家发现异常形状的烧焦的外壳。就好像大罐子或锅的内容被加热，直到液体烧掉，然后将干燥的地壳开始燃烧。该团队的第一次猜测是外壳是从火灾中摧毁的谷物储存罐子。但是在扫描电子显微镜下，单个颗粒的细胞壁看起来异常薄 - 哈士说，别的东西正在发生。</p><p> After comparing the Austrian finds to similar crusts found in Egyptian breweries from around the same time, Heiss and Valamoti concluded that the thin cell walls were the result of germination, or malting, a crucial step in the brewing process. These early Austrian farmers were brewing beer  9. “We ended up with something completely different” from the earlier hypotheses, Heiss says. “Several lines of evidence really interlocked and fell into place.”</p><p> 比较奥地利在埃及啤酒厂的类似地壳的同时，Heiss和Valamoti得出结论，薄细胞壁是萌发或搅拌的结果，酿造过程中的关键步骤。 Heiss说，这些早期的奥地利农民酿造了啤酒9.“我们最终与早期的假设完全不同”。 “几行证据真的互锁并落入了地方。”</p><p> Bread, it seems, goes even further back. Arranz-Otaegui was working at a 14,500-year-old site in Jordan when she found charred bits of ‘probable food’ in the hearths of long-ago hunter-gatherers. When she showed scanning electron microscope images of the stuff to Lara González Carretero, an archaeobotanist at the Museum of London Archaeology who works on evidence of bread baking at a Neolithic site in Turkey called Çatalhöyük, both researchers were shocked. The charred crusts from Jordan had tell-tale bubbles, showing they were burnt pieces of bread  10.</p><p> 面包，似乎，进一步回来了。 Arranz-otaegui在乔丹的一个14,500岁的遗址工作，当时她在亨特收集者的壁炉中发现了“可能的食物”的烧焦位。当她向LaraGonzálezCaretero展示了扫描电子显微镜图像时，伦敦考古博物馆的古老博物馆均致力于叫做Çatalhöyük的新石器时代的面包烘烤的证据，这两个研究人员都很震惊。乔丹的烧焦的外壳讲述了故障泡沫，显示它们被烧掉了11块。</p><p>  Most archaeologists have assumed that bread didn’t appear on the menu until after grain had been domesticated — 5,000 years after the cooking accident in question. So it seems that the early bakers in Jordan used wild wheat.</p><p>  大多数考古学家都假设面包没有出现在菜单上，直到粮食驯化后 - 烹饪事故造成的5000年。所以似乎乔丹的早期面包师使用了野麦小麦。</p><p> The evidence provides crucial clues to the origins of the Neolithic revolution, when people began to settle down and domesticate grain and animals, which happened at different times in various parts of the world. Before farming began, a loaf of bread would have been a luxury product that required time-consuming and tedious work gathering the wild grain needed for baking. That hurdle could have helped to spur crucial changes.</p><p> 当人们开始安定下来和驯化粮食和动物时，证据向新石器时代革命的起源提供了关键的线索，当时在世界各地的不同时间发生在不同时间。在农业开始之前，一条面包将是一种奢侈品，需要耗时和繁琐的工作，收集烘焙所需的野生谷物。这种障碍可以帮助刺激至关重要的变化。</p><p> Arranz-Otaegui’s research suggests that — at least in the Near East — demand for bread might have been a factor in driving people to attempt to domesticate wheat, as they looked for ways to ensure a steady supply of baked goods. “What we are seeing in Jordan has implications for bigger processes. What drove the transition to agriculture is one of the fundamental questions in archaeology,” Arranz-Otaegui says. “This shows hunter-gatherers were using cereals.”</p><p> 阿拉瑞斯 - 奥塔格富的研究表明 - 至少在近东 - 对面包的需求可能是驱使人们试图驯化小麦的一个因素，因为他们寻找确保稳定供应烘焙食品的方法。 “我们在约旦看到的内容对更大的流程有影响。推动到农业过渡是考古学中的基本问题之一，“阿拉兰斯·奥·奥比伊说。 “这表明亨特收集者正在使用谷物。” </p><p> The next frontier for archaeobotanists is prehistoric salad bars. Researchers are working on ways to look for the remains of food that wasn’t cooked, such as leafy greens, another overlooked part of the ancient diet. Because raw greens and vegetables are even harder to find in the archaeological record than cooked seeds and grains, Kubiak-Martens calls them the “missing link” in knowledge about ancient diets. “There’s no way to prove green leaves were eaten from charred remains,” Kubiak-Martens says. “But you would be surprised at how much green vegetables are in human coprolites”, or preserved faeces. Kubiak-Martens got a grant in 2019 to look at 6,300-year-old palaeofaeces preserved at wetland sites in the Netherlands, which she hopes will reveal everything prehistoric farmers there had on their dinner tables.</p><p>Archaeobotanists的下一个边疆是史前沙拉吧。研究人员正在努力寻找没有烹饪的食物的遗体，例如绿叶蔬菜，另一个被忽视的古代饮食所忽视的部分。由于生蔬菜和蔬菜更难以找到考古记录而不是煮熟的种子和谷物，Kubiak-Martens称他们是关于古代饮食知识的“缺失的链接”。 “没有办法证明遗骸食用绿叶，”Kubiak-Martens说。 “但是你会感到惊讶的是，绿色蔬菜是人类群的多少”，或保存的粪便。 Kubiak-Martens于2019年获得了一项格兰特，看看荷兰湿地景点的6,300岁的古古代，她希望揭示史前农民的一切盛会。</p><p>  The quest to understand ancient diets has led some researchers to take extreme measures. That’s the case with Göbekli Tepe, which has yielded very few organic remains that could provide clues to the prehistoric plant-based meals there. So Dietrich has tried innovative thinking — and a lot of elbow grease. Her approach has been to recreate the tools people used to make food, not the dishes themselves.</p><p>  寻求理解古代饮食已经领导了一些研究人员采取极端措施。这就是GöbekliTEPE的情况，它产生了很少有机遗骸，可以为史前植物的膳食提供线索。因此，饮食蕾丝试过创新思维 - 以及很多肘部润滑脂。她的方法一直是重新创造人们曾经制作食物的工具，而不是那里的菜肴。</p><p> In her airy lab on a tree-lined street in Berlin, Dietrich explains her time-consuming and physically demanding process.

A software program then produces 3D models from the two sets of pictures. Her experiments have shown that grinding fine flour for baking bread leaves a different finish on the stones from producing coarsely ground grain that is ideal for boiling as porridge or brewing beer.</p><p> 花了八个小时后，磨了四公斤的雷奥洛姆einkorn小麦内核，迪素再次拍摄石头。然后，软件程序从两组图片中产生3D模型。她的实验表明，用于烘烤面包的细面粉在石头上留下不同的表面，从生产粗糙的地面谷物，这是煮沸作为粥或酿造啤酒的理想选择。</p><p> And after handling thousands of grindstones, she is often able to identify what they were used for by touch. “I touch the stones to feel for flattening,” she says. “Fingers can feel changes at the nano level.” By comparing the wear patterns on her modern replicas to the stones piled in Göbekli Tepe’s rock garden, Dietrich could show that fine-ground bread flour was the exception. In a 2020 study  11, she argues people there were mostly grinding grain coarsely, just enough to break up its tough outer layer of bran and make it easy to boil and eat as porridge or ferment into beer.</p><p> 在处理成千上万的磨石之后，她常常能够识别它们通过触摸使用的内容。 “我触摸了燃气的石头，”她说。 “手指可以感受到纳米水平的变化。”通过将她现代复制品上的磨损模式与在GöbekliTepe的岩石花园堆积的石头上进行比较，饮食尤其可以表明细地面面粉是例外。在2020年的研究11中，她认为人们大多数粗糙的谷物粗糙，足以分解它坚韧的麸皮，使其容易煮沸并作为粥或烧成啤酒。</p><p> To test the theory, Dietrich commissioned a stonemason to carve a replica of a 30-litre stone vat from Göbekli Tepe. In 2019, she and her team successfully cooked porridge using heated stones, carefully recording and timing each step of the process. They also brewed a Neolithic beer from hand-ground germinated grain, or malt, in the open vessel. The results were “a bit bitter, but drinkable”, Dietrich says. “If you’re thirsty in the Neolithic.”</p><p> 为了测试理论，迪素委员会委托了一个斯托克马斯，可以从GöbekliTEPE雕刻一个30升石头增值税的复制品。 2019年，她和她的团队使用加热的石头成功地煮熟粥，仔细录制和定时过程的每一步。他们还在公开血管中从手工磨粒谷物或麦芽酿造的新石器时代的啤酒。 Dietrich说，结果是“有点苦，但饮用”。 “如果你在新石器时士的口渴。”</p><p> From the grind stones and other plant-processing tools at Göbekli Tepe, a picture is now emerging for what was going on there 12,000 years ago. Rather than just starting to experiment with wild grains, the monument builders were apparently proto-farmers, already familiar with the cooking possibilities grain offered despite having no domesticated crops. “These are the best grinding tools ever, and I’ve seen a lot of grindstones,” Dietrich says. “People at Göbekli Tepe knew what they were doing, and what could be done with </p><p> 来自Grind Stones和其他植物加工工具在GöbekliTEPE，现在正在出现一张图片，这是12000年前在那里发生的事情。纪念碑建筑们而不是仅仅开始尝试狂野的谷物，显然是虽然没有驯化的作物，但已经熟悉粮食粮食已经熟悉粮食。 “这些是有史以来最好的磨削工具，我见过很多磨石，”Dietrich说。 “Göbekli的人们知道他们正在做的事情，并且可以做些什么 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/啤酒/">#啤酒</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/people/">#people</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷物/">#谷物</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
