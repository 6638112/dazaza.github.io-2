Signal Fire led the equity portion of its financing, which also included participation from existing seed investors Y Combinator and DN Capital.\n Accept.inc describes itself as an iLender, or a \u201ctechnology-enabled lender\u201d that gives people a way to submit all-cash offers on a home upon qualifying for a mortgage.\n  Using its platform, a buyer gets qualified first and then can start looking for homes that fall at or under the amount he or she is approved for. They can purchase a more expensive home, but any amount above what they are approved for would have to come out of pocket. Historically, most buyers don\u2019t know that they will have to pay out of pocket until they\u2019ve made an offer on a specific home and an appraisal comes under the amount of the price they are paying for a home. In those cases, the buyer has to cough up the difference out of pocket. With Accept.inc., its execs tout, buyers know upfront how much they are approved for and can spend on a new home \u201cso there are no surprises later.\u201d\n SignalFire Founding Partner and CTO  Ilya Kirnos describes  Accept.inc as \u201cthe first and only iLender.\u201d\n He points out that since it is a lender, Accept.inc doesn\u2019t make its money by charging buyers fees like some others in the all-cash offer space.\n \u201cUnlike \u2018iBuyers\u2019 or \u2018 alternative iBuyers,\u2019 Accept.inc fronts the cash to buy a house and then makes money off mortgage origination and title, meaning sellers, homebuyers and their agents pay no additional cost for the service,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n IBuyers instead buy  homes from sellers who signed up online, make a profit by often fixing up and selling those homes and then helping people purchase a different home with all cash. They also make money by charging transaction fees. A slew of companies operate in the space including established players such as  Opendoor and Zillow and newer players such as Homelight.\n  Since its 2016 inception, Accept.inc says it has  helped thousands of buyers, agents and sellers close on \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in homes. The company  saw \u201d14x\u201d growth in 2020 and from June 2020 to June 2021, it achieved \u201c10x\u201d growth in terms of the size of its team and number of transactions and revenue, according to CEO and co-founder Adam Pollack. Accept.inc wants to use its new capital to build on that momentum and meet demand.\n Pollack and Nick Friedman met while in college  and started building Accept.inc with the goal of \u201cturning every offer into a cash offer.\u201d The pair essentially \u201cfailed for two years,\u201d half-jokes Pollack.\n \u201cWe basically became an encyclopedia of 1,000 ways the idea of helping people make all-cash offers   wouldn\u2019t  work,\u201d he said.\n The team went through Y Combinator in the winter of 2019 and that\u2019s when they created the iLender concept. In the iLender model, the company uses its cash to buy a house for buyers. Once the loan with Accept.inc is ready to close, the company sells back the house to the buyer \u201cat no additional cost or fees.\u201d\n \u201cBasically what we learned through those two years is that you have to vertically integrate all of your core competencies, and you can\u2019t rely on third parties to own or manage your special sauce for you,\u201d Pollack told TechCrunch. \u201cWe also realized that if you\u2019re going to build a cash offer for anyone who could afford a mortgage, you\u2019ve got to make it a full bona fide cash offer that closes in three days as opposed to a better version of what existed. And you have to own that, and take the risk that comes with it and be comfortable with that.\u201d\n The benefits of their model, the pair say, is that buyers get to be cash buyers, sellers can close in as little as 32 hours, and agents \u201cget a guaranteed commission check.\u201d\n \u201cOur mission is that everyone should have an equal chance at homeownership,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cWe not only want to level the playing field, we want to create a new standard.\u201d\n Buyers using Accept.inc win 6-7 times more frequently, the company claims. With its new capital,  It also plans to double its team of 90 and enter new markets outside of its home base of Denver.\n SignalFire Partner Chris Scoggins believes that Accept.inc is different from other lenders in that its focus is on  \u201cwinning the home, not just servicing the loan, with a business model that\u2019s 10x more capital-efficient than other players in the market.\n \u201c The team is driven\u2026to level the playing field for homebuyers who today lose out against all-cash offers from home-flippers and wealthy individuals,\u201d he added. \u201c We see an enormous opportunity for Accept.inc to become the backbone of the future of mortgage lending.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 21:30:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6570\u5b57,equity,\u73b0\u91d1", "title": "\u63a5\u53d7\u3002inc\u5728\u503a\u52a1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u4e2d\u786e\u4fdd90\u7c73\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u6570\u5b57\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u5e73\u53f0 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAccept.inc secures $90M in debt and equity to scale its digital mortgage lending platform\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/accept-inc-secures-90m-in-debt-equity/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6570\u5b57", "equity", "\u73b0\u91d1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "15d1c22eed24cdd07338728d5b3a13f3.jpeg", "infoid": 1067969, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Luminar\u4e4b\u524d\u66fe\u5ba3\u5e03\u8fc7\u6c83\u5c14\u6c83\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\uff0cLuminar\u7684\u5806\u6808\u5c06\u5728\u65d7\u8230\u8f66\u4e0a\u662f\u53ef\u9009\u7684 - \u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c06\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5185\u7f6e\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5ba2\u6237\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u516c\u8def\u8bd5\u70b9\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u9a7e\u9a76\u65f6\u624d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4ece\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u653e\u51fa - \u5b83\u4eec\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u5fc5\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\uff0ca\u719f\u6089\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5ba2\u6237\u60f3\u8981\u5b83\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u4e3a\u6b64\u4ed8\u51fa\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002\n  \u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u88ab\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u5730\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5ba2\u6237\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u5957\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6c7d\u8f66\u4e8b\u6545\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\n \u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u6beb\u65e0\u7591\u95ee\u662fLuminar\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u798f\u97f3\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u5377\u5916\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u5c06\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u6570\u5343\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u6570\u5343\u82f1\u91cc - \u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9001\u56de\u5176\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5806\u6808\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7a7a\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5e94\u8be5\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u800c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u806a\u660e'\u3002\n \u6c83\u5c14\u6c83\u6ca1\u6709\u900f\u9732\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u98de\u884c\u5458\u52a0\u8f7d\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u8ba2\u9605\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6216\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8d2d\u4e70\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5236\u9020\u5546\u786e\u5b9e\u8bf4\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8f66\u8f86\u90fd\u5c06\u662f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u201c\u786c\u4ef6\u51c6\u5907\u201d\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u5b83\u53ef\u7528\u3002 ", "note_en": "Luminar had previously announced  the production deal with Volvo last May. But at that time, Luminar\u2019s stack was going to be optional on the flagship vehicle \u2014 an upgrade that would add on cost. Now, it will be built into each vehicle as a matter of course.\n However, customers will still have to pay if they want to take advantage of the Highway Pilot functionality. That capability, which will be available only when the vehicle is driving on a highway, puts the driver out of the loop \u2014 they won\u2019t even have to actively monitor the vehicle, as is common in some systems already on the road today, a source familiar with the technology told TechCrunch. It\u2019s the highest capability of autonomy that the system offers, and if customers want it, they will have to pay for it.\n  That functionality will be activated wirelessly when the conditions are verified to be safe, Luminar said in a news release. What customers won\u2019t have to pay for is a suite of safety capabilities, like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping, that target the most common cause of car accidents.\n The deal is undoubtedly a major boon for Luminar.

Thrusters are used throughout the lifespan of a satellite (or any object in space that needs to maintain its orbit, like the space station) to adjust orbital altitude, avoid collisions, and de-orbit the craft once it has reached the end of its useful life. Hall thrusters use a magnetic field to ionize a propellant and produce plasma.\n While they have long been used in space, this type of thruster has mostly been too expensive for small satellite operators.  Orbion says it has created a cost-effective production capacity to meet the growing demand of startups and developers launching to low Earth orbit. Orbion CEO Brad King said in a statement that the company considered contract manufacturers but ultimately chose a vertically integrated manufacturing model. Now, the company says it has outgrown its existing manufacturing space.\n  The company is facing \u201cunprecedented market demand\u201d for its Aurora system, King said. With the boom of the so-called new space economy, driven in part by the decreased costs of processors, components and even launch, it\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s been a concurrent uptick in demand for efficient in-space propulsion systems.\n  The company had previously raised a  $9.2 million Series A in August 2019. Since that time, the company secured a  research partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense that\u2019s testing the resiliency of American space systems. Orbion also landed a contract with satellite manufacturer Blue Canyon Technologies last September.\n This most recent funding round was led by the US-India VC firm Inventus Capital Partners, with additional participation from Material Impact, Beringea and Wakestream Ventures.\n \u201cThe space game is changing,\u201d Inventus Capital Partners investor Kanwal Rekhi said in a statement. \u201cLarge satellites are being replaced by a multitude of nano-satellites; just like the PCs replaced mainframes.

It comes on the heels of the company charting some massive growth, despite being a relatively quiet player in the industry.\n  Dave Otten, the CEO and co-founder of the company (which is named after another co-founder, Jeroen Wijering, who developed the initial technology), told TechCrunch in an interview that the company\u2019s video streaming traffic by nearly 200% over the last year, with live streaming growing 400% in that period.\n There are now over 600,000 applications and sites running video powered by JW Player, with about 10,000 of those premium users; the rest use its software for free, Otten said.\n This is enough of a balance that the company has been profitable for a number of years, he said. And in cases where the software is being used for free, JW Player is getting \u201cpaid\u201d in a\u00a0 Some of the many customers using its tools include Sesame Street, TIME, Hearst, Insider, IMDB and the Chelsea Football Club.\n  It\u2019s a long way away from JW\u2019s early days powering YouTube \u2014 screen shot of how it looked above \u2014 but contrary to so many examples of early movers being some of the slowest to innovate later on, JW is hoping that the fact that it was a first mover in video does not mean it will be the last to anticipate what is coming in the future.\n  Just as companies have increasingly started to create paywalls around their written content, they are looking to do the same for their video catalogues, too, and JW Player wants to be their partner for this. That will include more investments into subscription services, as well as a a new set of tools for personalizing videos and providing advertising opportunities by way of the extensive data that it has amassed and continues to gather about video usage.\n The company has a strong card to play in its hand for the latter business: those who use the free version of JW Player \u201cpay\u201d the company by way of helping it gather lots of insights into how videos are watched.\n Another area that the company will be doing more is in the area of live and on-demand video. In May, it acquired Vualto, a UK-based specialist in these areas that also builds DRM solutions, which it has already integrated into its platform.\n Video now accounts for a whopping 80% of all online traffic, with people typically spending more than two hours days watching it. While some of that is inevitably going big platforms like YouTube, Facebook, social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, there remains a big opportunity for others, aided by the likes of JW, to carve out spaces for themselves in the mix.\n \u201cJW Player has been at the forefront of digital video innovation ever since founder Jeroen Wijering created YouTube\u2019s original video player in 2008.

The change would prevent an advertiser that recorded your visit to a dieting website from later showing you ads for weight loss programs on other sites, for example.\n   On Thursday, Google pushed that move out by nearly two years, allowing itself more time to develop and test privacy-preserving alternatives to third-party cookies, and for websites to adopt the changes. The company said it had delayed the change, part of a collection of adjustments to what Google calls its  Privacy Sandbox, to chart a better course for advertisers and everyone else on the web.\n &#34;We need to move at a responsible pace, allowing sufficient time for public discussion on the right solutions and for publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services,&#34; Chrome Engineering Director Vinay Goel said in a blog post. &#34;This is important to avoid jeopardizing the business models of many web publishers which support freely available content.&#34;\n The delay comes amid intensifying pressure on Silicon Valley giants to fix the internet&#39;s privacy problem. Laws like  Europe&#39;s GDPR and the  California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) target the data collection that Google and other companies want for fine tuning the advertisements they deliver. The ad tech industry doesn&#39;t have forever to change course because anyone dissatisfied with Chrome&#39;s pace has abundant alternatives.\n All Chrome&#39;s top rivals, including  Apple&#39;s Safari,  Mozilla&#39;s Firefox,  Microsoft&#39;s Edge and  Brave Software&#39;s Brave, take more aggressive measures at stopping tracking than Google. If you want to stick with Chrome, browser extensions like  Ghostery,  DuckDuckGo,  Privacy Badger and  uBlock Origin, are designed to block trackers.\n One part of Google&#39;s rationale for pushing back its plan is that moving too fast will encourage tracking companies to use sneakier tracking methods than cookies. One such method, fingerprinting, uses trackers to gather browser configuration details, such as the version you&#39;re using and which fonts you&#39;ve downloaded. With enough of those details, trackers can identify you accurately.\n Google believes blocking third-party cookies at this stage is actually bad for people using the web because it drives tracking companies to covert approaches such as fingerprinting. &#34;Unlike cookies, users cannot clear their fingerprint, and therefore cannot control how their information is collected or used. We don&#39;t think that&#39;s a sustainable long term investment,&#34; Goel said in a statement to CNET.\n  Websites also are moving to other tracking methods like requiring logins for free content. That provides them a very specific identifier for profiling your behavior and potentially matching it to your activity on other sites that know it.\n Browsers don&#39;t block first-party cookies, which are set by the operator of the website you&#39;re visiting or advertisers contributing ads. First-party cookies help with tasks like remembering what&#39;s in your e-commerce shopping cart or keeping you logged in for subsequent visits. One ad tech workaround for third-party cookie blocking, though, is to tie in with websites to use their first-party privileges.\n First-party cookies also are a thorny issue for Google. It has giant websites like search and YouTube that let it set first-party cookies. It also has a big online advertising business that can benefit from Google&#39;s cookies and tracking information. Other advertising companies don&#39;t have that privileged status, which is why the  European Commission opened an antitrust investigation on Google&#39;s ad technology and the US  Justice Department reportedly also is examining Google&#39;s cookie approach.\n Goel denied that Google will get an edge, though. &#34;Privacy Sandbox technologies will not give preferential treatment or advantage to Google&#39;s advertising products or to Google&#39;s own sites,&#34; he told CNET. Indeed,   Google committed to &#34; no data advantage for Google advertising products&#34; after the UK&#39;s Competitions and Markets Authority   started investigating Google ad-tech competition issues.\n In addition to eventually phasing out third-party cookies, Google is working on a technology called  federated learning of cohorts, or FLOC, that matches ads to large groups of people, rather than individuals. With it, the browser monitors your browsing history and groups you with thousands of others with similar behavior into a cohort. Advertisers, noticing that a particular cohort is visiting a type of website, can then show ads to other members of that cohort on other sites.\n FLOC has its critics.  Brave opposes FLOC, as does the  Vivaldi browser. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit, says  FLOC is a &#34;terrible idea.&#34; And  Mozilla concluded FLOC lets sites &#34;learn a lot about you with far less effort than they would need to expend today.&#34;\n Google is working on revisions to FLOC, too. It plans to incorporate feedback for changes and a new round of testing.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 21:23:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u53d1\u5e03,\u5ef6\u8fdf,delay", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u5212\u4ece2022\u5e74\u521d\u52302023\u5e74\u521d\u963b\u6b62\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9Cookie\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u4e0d\u4f24\u5bb3\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u8005 ", "title_en": "Google will delay plans to block third-party cookies from early 2022 to late 2023, to find ways to protect privacy without hurting ad-dependent publishers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/google-delays-chromes-cookie-blocking-privacy-plan-by-nearly-2-years/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u53d1\u5e03", "\u5ef6\u8fdf", "delay"]}]
