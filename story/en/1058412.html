This was a few weeks into the coronavirus lockdown, so Adam initially took her garb to be a sign of precautionary vigilance. In fact, it was a disguise. “It’s so the crows don’t recognize me and—no offense—start associating me with you.”</p><p>当乌鸦哨者出现在亚当佛罗林和丹尼费舍尔的房子的侧门时，在加利福尼亚州奥克兰，她穿着黑色的脚趾，穿着连帽衫，手套和面具。这是冠状病毒锁定的几个星期，所以亚当最初将她的服装带到预防性警惕的迹象。事实上，这是一个伪装。 “这是所以乌鸦不认识我，而且 - 没有冒犯 - 开始与你联系起来。”</p><p> Adam found this odd, but he and his wife were out of options. Things had gotten bad. Two days earlier, the couple had just woken up their four-month-old, Lina, from a nap when they heard a concerning ruckus behind the house. At the far end of the yard, Dani—who is one of my oldest friends—spotted a menacing cloud of crows, cawing and encircling their dog, Mona. It looked as though they might carry her away or, worse, kill her on the spot. (“Do you know what a group of crows is called?” Dani later asked me, stricken. “A murder.”) She shouted, raced toward Mona, and dispersed the crows just long enough to get her dog inside.</p><p> 亚当发现了这个奇怪的，但他和他的妻子出了选择。事情已经变坏了。两天早些时候，这对夫妇刚刚醒来，当他们听到房子后面的ruckus时，从午睡中醒来。在院子的远端，丹尼 - 谁是我最古老的朋友之一 - 发现了一个威胁的乌鸦蔓延，包围他们的狗，蒙娜。它看起来好像可能会带走她或者更糟糕的是，在现场杀死她。 （“你知道一群乌鸦被称为什么？”丹尼后来问我，遭到袭击。“谋杀罪。”）她喊道，走向蒙娜，散开足够长的乌鸦，让她的狗在里面得到她的狗。</p><p> From then on, each time Adam or Dani walked onto their back deck, a crow would call out and the murder would reappear as if summoned, squawking so loudly that it was impossible to carry on a conversation. Sometimes the crows would dive-bomb them or attack Mona when she went out to pee. When Adam took the dog for a walk, the crows swooped low and followed them. He tried walking Mona in other neighborhoods, but the crows terrorized him there too. Adam and Dani felt under siege. They worried for Lina’s safety. “The crows are like the Mafia,” Dani told me a few weeks into their ordeal. They’d stopped going outside, she said, unless it was absolutely necessary. And because of the pandemic, they couldn’t really go anywhere else.</p><p> 从那时起，每次亚当或丹尼都走到了他们的背甲板上，乌鸦会叫出来，谋杀案会像召唤一样再次出现，大声地争吵，争吵是不可能进行谈话。有时，当她出去撒尿时，乌鸦将潜水或攻击蒙娜。当亚当拿走狗散步时，乌鸦猛扑猛扑，跟着它们。他在其他社区努力走路，但乌鸦也吓到了他。亚当和丹尼感到围攻。他们担心Lina的安全。 “乌鸦就像黑手党一样，”丹尼告诉我几个星期的时间。她说，除非是绝对必要的，否则他们会停止走到外面。而且由于大流行，他们无法真正去其他地方。</p><p> The day Dani rescued Mona from the crows, a neighbor thought he’d spotted a fledgling in Mona’s mouth before the murder first descended. Dani and Adam weren’t so sure—they had never seen Mona attack a bird before. But it nevertheless occurred to them that they might be on some kind of crow hit list. Through online research, Adam learned that crows have an uncanny ability to recognize humans, assign them moral qualities, and pass this information on to other crows, even to future generations. Desperate, Adam took to Reddit. If you’re at war with the crows, post after post advised, your best option is to move.</p><p> 当天丹尼从乌鸦救出蒙娜，一个邻居认为他在谋杀案之前在蒙娜的嘴里发现了一只雏鸟。丹尼和亚当不太确定 - 他们从未见过Mona之前攻击一只鸟。但它仍然发生在他们可能是某种乌鸦命中列表。通过在线研究，亚当知道乌鸦有一个不可思议的识别人类的能力，分配道德品质，并将这些信息传递给其他乌鸦，即使是后代。绝望，亚当采取了红土。如果您在与乌鸦的战争中，发布后邮寄建议，您最好的选择就是移动。</p><p> “What do you know about crows?” he posted on Facebook. “Namely, conflict resolution?” Friends and family members expressed concern and offered suggestions (“Try a squirt gun?” his mother wrote). A few neighbors chimed in with their own recommendation: he needed to talk to Yvette Buigues, the local crow whisperer. Adam wrote her a message, and she promised to come over right away.</p><p> “你对乌鸦知道什么？”他发布在Facebook上。 “即冲突解决方案？”朋友和家庭成员表示关切和提出建议（“尝试喷枪？”他的母亲写道）。几个邻居用自己的建议汇集了他们的建议：他需要与伊维特布里格斯交谈，当地乌鸦悄悄话。亚当写了一条消息，她答应马上过来。</p><p> The crows descended, cawing loudly, as soon as Buigues entered the backyard the next day. She began, she told me later, by offering soothing words, and sending the birds unspoken messages: that she came in peace, that she was there to help. They quieted almost immediately. Buigues poked around the area where the crows had congregated, which Adam and Dani had been avoiding. She spotted a fledgling hidden in the brush. Its wing was mangled and bloody, hanging from its body by mere strands. It peeped with fear and hunger. As a new father, Adam was moved almost to tears by the sight of the injured young bird.</p><p> 一旦Buigues在第二天进入后院，乌鸦也会下降，大声倾斜。她开始，她以后告诉我，通过提供舒缓的话语，并派出鸟类未说出口的信息：她和平，她在那里提供帮助。他们几乎立即安静下来。在乌鸦已经发烧的地区刺痛了布里格斯，亚当和丹尼一直在避免。她发现了一个隐藏在刷子里的雏鸟。它的翅膀被摧毁了，血腥，只用绞线悬挂在身体上。它偷袭着恐惧和饥饿。作为一个新的父亲，亚当被伤害的年轻鸟儿逐渐泪流满面。</p><p> The murder looked on as Buigues chatted calmly with the fledgling, which then staggered toward her, lugging its throbbing wing. She put out her hand and the trembling crow walked right into it, opening its beak in search of food. In all likelihood, said Buigues, it wasn’t going to make it.</p><p> 谋杀案在春天聊天的时候，刚刚用雏鸟聊天，然后朝着她交错，拖着悸动的翅膀。她伸出手，颤抖的乌鸦走进去，打开它的喙寻找食物。在所有可能性中，Buigues说，它不会成功。 </p><p> Buigues told Adam they had two options: take the bird to a vet to be euthanized and leave the crows an offering of peanuts—a favorite corvid treat—or simply provide the fledgling with a comfortable way to spend its final hours. Adam opted for the latter, and Buigues asked him to fetch a box and line it with soft towels. She then gently placed the bird inside, along with a small dish of water. Buigues sent a few silent messages of apology and thanks, then slowly backed away, leaving the baby bird in its makeshift coffin.</p><p>Buigues告诉亚当他们有两种选择：把鸟儿带到兽医被安乐死并离开乌鸦的花生 - 一个最喜欢的犬儒，或者只是用舒适的方式提供熟食的肉类治疗。亚当选择了后者，并Buigues问他取一个盒子，用柔软的毛巾行吧。然后她轻轻地将鸟儿放在里面，以及一小碟。 Buigues发出了一些道歉的无声消息，谢谢，然后慢慢退缩，让婴儿鸟在其临时棺材中。</p><p> A few hours later, the bird was gone—whether snatched up by a predator or retrieved by the parent crows, Adam and Dani weren’t sure. They scattered some birdseed around the emptied box, worrying that they’d be punished for choosing to leave the fledgling exposed. But when they stepped outside, the murder kept its distance. The couple could sit on the deck, and even in the shade of their trees, without bother. Something had shifted.</p><p> 几个小时后，鸟已经走了 - 无论是被捕食者抢走还是由父乌鸦，亚当和达尼都是不确定的。他们在空洞的盒子周围分散了一些小鸟，令人担忧他们被惩罚，选择留下暴露的刚刚蔓延。但是当他们走到外面时，谋杀案不距离。这对夫妇可以坐在甲板上，甚至在他们的树荫下，没有打扰。有些东西已经转移了。</p><p> Last May, as the number of coronavirus deaths continued to rise, many of the animals that live among us in cities and towns—residing in gutters and trees and parks and crawl spaces—had their worlds turned upside down. City centers were empty; dumpsters were no longer filled with scraps of food; fewer cars were on the road; neighborhood parks were thick with people who would otherwise have been working or at school. If it weren’t for the coronavirus, Mona would never have been outside that morning chasing fledglings, because Adam and Dani would have been where they usually were in the middle of the day—at work.</p><p> 最后，随着冠状病毒死亡人数持续上涨，许多生活在城市和城镇中居住在排水沟和树木和公园和爬行空间中的动物 - 让他们的世界颠倒了。城市中心是空的;垃圾箱不再充满了食物的废料;较少的汽车在路上;邻里公园与否则在学校工作或学校的人很厚。如果它不适用于冠状病毒，那么蒙娜将永远不会在那天早上追逐漂浮物，因为亚当和丹尼将是他们通常在日常工作中间的地方。</p><p> Around the same time, news began circulating in Oakland about a turkey named Gerald. He had taken up residence at the Morcom Rose Garden along with his mate and chicks, and was behaving aggressively toward humans. He clawed and chased and left bruises; he stole food; he threatened children and ruined picnics; he jumped onto one woman’s back as she was trying to flee. City workers relocated Gerald to the nearby hills, where I like to go running, but he soon returned. The parks department secured a permit for his execution.</p><p> 大约在同一时间，新闻开始在奥克兰传播关于一个名叫杰拉尔德的火鸡。他在Morcom玫瑰园和伴侣和小鸡一起居住，并对人类积极表现得很积极。他抓住和追捕并留下瘀伤;他偷了食物;他威胁了孩子和毁了野餐;当她试图逃离时，他跳到了一个女人的背上。市工人将杰拉尔德搬到附近的山丘，我喜欢去跑，但他很快就返回了。公园部门获得了执行许可证。</p><p> Elsewhere in Oakland, a solitary peacock roamed the streets screaming.  SFGate ran an article quoting a resident named Jesse T.: “It’s so loud inside my house it literally feels like he is inside my house.” In San Francisco, the quiet streets were overrun with coyotes. On Martha’s Vineyard, turkeys colonized the rooftops of empty houses, causing traffic jams of gawking rubberneckers. Antlered deer marched down boulevards in Paris, wild pigs wandered around suburban neighborhoods in Turkey, kangaroos hopped through downtown Adelaide, rams tore through villages in Wales, and pumas prowled the streets of Santiago before they were sedated by authorities and dragged back into the wild. A friend reported that her husband’s office in New York had been taken over by rattlesnakes.</p><p> 在奥克兰的其他地方，一个孤独的孔雀漫游街头尖叫。 SFGATE运行了一篇名叫Jesse T的居民的文章：“它在我家里面如此响亮，它真的感觉他在我的房子里面。”在旧金山，安静的街道被土狼用。在玛莎的葡萄园，火鸡殖民地殖民地的空房子的屋顶，导致交通堵塞的juldneckers。鹿茸的鹿岛在巴黎沿着郊区郊区徘徊，袋鼠徘徊在阿德莱斯市中心，在威尔士队的村庄队的村庄徘徊，在当局镇压之前徘徊在圣地亚哥的街道上并拖回野外。一位朋友报道，她的丈夫在纽约的办事处被响尾蛇队接管了。</p><p> At my own house, about a month into California’s shelter-in-place order, my husband spotted a hummingbird nest in the lower branches of the birch tree in our small backyard. The nest was well hidden, almost entirely concealed by drooping branches and abundant leaves. Each morning we’d watch, spellbound, as the hummingbird sat on its eggs, roosting, waiting. What else did we have to do? A co-worker reported that she too had found a hummingbird nest in her backyard. Soon after, other friends made the same discovery. It seemed like a delightful coincidence. But who knew how long these birds had been there without our knowing?</p><p> 在我自己的房子里，大约一个月进入加利福尼亚州的地下秩序，我的丈夫在小后院的桦树的下部分支中发现了一个蜂鸟巢。巢穴隐藏着，几乎完全隐藏着下垂的树枝和丰富的叶子。每天早上我们都会看，咒语，因为蜂鸟坐在鸡蛋上，栖息，等待。我们还有什么要做的？一名同事报告说，她也发现了她的后院的蜂鸟。不久之后，其他朋友发表了同样的发现。它似乎是一种令人愉快的巧合。但是，谁知道这些鸟类已经过多久了，没有我们知道？</p><p> These stories of animal invasion—even the more menacing ones—were a balm, a necessary distraction from the horrors of the news. And yet something more profound seemed to be at stake. What if dive-bombing crows were not just a reflection of the pandemic’s disruption but a glimpse of a world where the boundaries between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom had blurred? As I began to imagine a post-pandemic world—one with a more equitable education system, health care for all, accessible public spaces, a less exploitative economy—I wondered whether there was also an opportunity to rethink the relationship between humans and the natural environment. After Adam and Dani told me about the crow whisperer, I considered whether she might be uniquely able to help me imagine what this new relationship could look like. At the very least, it would give me something to think about besides the plague.</p><p> 这些动物入侵 - 甚至更为威胁的故事 - 是一种植物，是一个植物，这是来自新闻恐怖的必要分心。然而，更深刻的东西似乎有危险。如果潜水轰炸乌鸦不仅反映了大流行的中断，而且瞥见人类与动物王国之间的界限已经模糊？正如我开始想象一个大流行后的世界 - 一个拥有更公平的教育系统，对所有人，无障碍公共空间的医疗保健，一个较少的剥削性经济 - 我想知道是否有机会重新思考人类与自然之间的关系环境。在亚当和丹尼告诉我关于乌鸦低语之后，我考虑了她是否可能是独特的能够帮助我想象这种新的关系可能看起来像什么。至少，除了瘟疫之外，它会给我一些想法。 </p><p>  One morning in July, I texted Buigues to tell her I was interested in learning more about human-animal conflict mediation. She wrote back that same day, saying she would be happy to talk. “Right up my alley,” she said.</p><p>一天早上在7月，我发短信告诉她，我有兴趣了解人类冲突调解更多。她那天写回来，说她很乐意谈谈。 “就在我的巷子里，”她说。</p><p> I had imagined Buigues as some kind of ethereal new-age mystic, but she turned out to be a rowdy fortysomething raconteur with a gravelly voice who loves to cuss. In addition to being a pet trainer and cranio-sacral therapist working with animals and their owners, she is a painter. Her subjects include pets and monsters, as well as crows.</p><p> 我想象了Buigues作为某种空灵的新时代的神秘性，但她原来是一个吵闹的Fortysomething raconteur，具有砾石的声音，他喜欢诅咒。除了作为宠物训练师和颅骨治疗师与动物及其业主一起使用，她是画家。她的科目包括宠物和怪物，以及乌鸦。</p><p> Buigues told me that she had been transfixed by animals since childhood, often finding them better companions than people. In her twenties, she went on a hiking trip in Utah with her boyfriend. Ravens followed them everywhere, as if seeking her attention, and she began talking to them. Buigues and the birds seemed to have a common understanding. (The boyfriend found this so disturbing that he broke up with her.) Years later, her husband came across a stranded fledgling crow in the middle of a dog park. She was sure it would be mauled to death, and told him to bring it home. She named the bird Carl and nursed him back to health, fed him, chatted with him, and eventually helped him learn to fly. He lived with her and her husband for over a year, eating lavish scrambled-egg breakfasts and sleeping in an aviary they built outside.</p><p> Buigues告诉我，她自童年以来被动物重混，经常发现它们比人更好的同伴。在她二十几岁，她和她的男朋友在犹他州的旅行中徒步旅行。乌鸦随时随地跟进他们，就像在寻求她的关注一样，她开始与他们交谈。 Buigues和鸟类似乎有一个共同的理解。 （男朋友发现这么令人不安，他和她分手了。）几年后，她的丈夫在狗公园中间遇到了一只搁浅的漂浮乌鸦。她确信它会被殴打，并告诉他把它带回家。她命名为鸟卡尔，并将他送回健康，喂他，和他聊天，最终帮助他学会飞行。他和她和她的丈夫一起生活过了一年多，吃了奢侈的炒蛋早餐，睡在他们内心的鸟瞰。</p><p> Eventually, some wild crows took notice and began circling their yard in the mornings. Carl became curious, training his eyes skyward. One day Carl took off. He returned four days later, careening into Buigues’s chest. He had a gash in his head and had lost some feathers. “That bird had gone off and had so much fun and gotten into some real exciting trouble,” she said. It was as though he’d taken a rumspringa. “He was basically like, ‘Take me back! I’m not ready!’ ” Carl stayed with them for another six months before the murder returned and Carl left for good. After that, Buigues was even more popular with the neighborhood crows. Carl seemed to have communicated that she was an ally.</p><p> 最终，有些野生乌鸦注意到早上开始在他们的院子里结束。卡尔变得好奇，训练了他的眼睛天空。有一天卡尔起飞了。他又回到了四天后，切成了Buigues的胸膛。他头上有一个伤口，失去了一些羽毛。 “那只鸟已经走了，有很多乐趣，并进入了一些真正的令人兴奋的麻烦，”她说。好像他拍了一个rumspringa。 “他基本上就像，”带我回去！我不是准备好了！“”卡尔在谋杀案回来之前六个月待了他们六个月，留下了善良。之后，Buigues甚至更受邻居乌鸦流行。卡尔似乎已经传达了她是一个盟友。</p><p> Buigues is wary of calling herself a psychic or a medium. “I’m just an old punk rocker,” she says, “who happens to be able to communicate with animals.” She carries a fair dose of skepticism about her power—perhaps it’s just common sense, she wonders, or deep intuition. Sometimes she freaks herself out. She has tried psychically beaming treatments to horses from many states away, only to hear from their owners that the animals were acting very strangely at the exact moment that Buigues’s treatment was under way. Once, while waiting for her husband to pick her up from Costco, she tried communicating with her dog, Cecil, just for fun. “The dog park was good,” she heard the dog tell her. “We saw Debbie, but I didn’t like her cookie.” That sounded unusual to Buigues; her dog loved treats. But sure enough, her husband pulled up and told her that they’d run into their friend Debbie. When she gave Cecil a cookie, Cecil spat it out. “It’s trippy,” Buigues told me. “I can’t explain it! I just sometimes know exactly what the fuck my dog is thinking.”</p><p> Buigues是谨慎呼唤自己的心理或媒介。 “我只是一个古老的朋克摇滚乐，”她说，“谁碰巧能够与动物沟通。”她对她的权力进行了展望的怀疑论，也许这只是常识，她奇迹，或深刻的直觉。有时她吓坏了。她尝试从许多州的马匹的心理上的射门治疗，只要听到他们的主人，这些动物在诸如布里格斯治疗的确切时刻，这些动物的行动非常奇怪。曾经，在等待她的丈夫从Costco挑选她的时候，她试图与她的狗，塞西尔沟通，只是为了好玩。 “狗公园很好，”她听到狗告诉她。 “我们看到了黛比，但我不喜欢她的饼干。”这对Buigues感到不寻常;她的狗喜欢零食。但是，果然，她的丈夫赶紧告诉她，他们遇到了他们的朋友黛比。当她给Cecil一个饼干时，Cecil Spat出来了。 “这是Trippy，”Buigues告诉我。 “我无法解释它！我有时会确切地知道他妈的我的狗在想什么。“</p><p> I wanted to see how Buigues worked in person. After months and months indoors, steeped in Zoom meetings and books, I was craving a firsthand magical experience. “Come on over anytime,” she told me when I asked. “I’ll pour you a shot.”</p><p> 我想看看Buigues如何亲自工作。经过几个月和几个月的室内，沉浸在缩放会议和书籍中，我正在渴望第一手神奇的体验。 “随时都会过来，”当我问的时候，她告诉我。 “我会倒你一枪。”</p><p> A week or so later, Buigues texted me saying that one of her regulars, Pamela Fong, was willing to let me observe a session with her bull terrier, Ernie. Fong lives up a winding road in El Cerrito, in a handsome house overlooking the vast, parched hills of Wildcat Canyon. “You’ll see my car parked out front,” Buigues texted. It was a Mini Cooper with a vanity plate that read  2dingoes, after the breed of her dogs. Buigues, dressed entirely in black, greeted me in the driveway and took me inside to meet Ernie and Fong. I could see immediately that the house belonged to Ernie. Baskets of toys were scattered around the living room and bedroom—new ones arrived every month via the subscription service BarkBox. Portraits of bull terriers hung on the wall, including a custom work that Buigues had painted a few years earlier.</p><p> 一周左后，Buigues发布了我说，她的一个常客，帕梅拉奉，愿意让我与她的斗牛犬，厄尼与她的斗牛犬一起观察会议。奉命在El Cerrito蜿蜒蜿蜒的道路，在一个俯瞰着浩瀚，燕麦峡谷的广阔的山丘的英俊的房子里。 “你会看到我的车停在前面，”Buigues发短信。这是一个迷你库珀，一个带有梳妆台的梳妆板，在她的狗的品种之后阅读了2种。 Buigues，穿着黑色的，穿着黑色，在车道上迎接我，带我走进去厄尼和奉。我可以立即看到房子属于厄尼。玩具篮子散落在客厅和卧室 - 新的人每月到达订阅服务巴克箱。野蛮的斗牛犬挂在墙上的肖像，包括海关涂上几年前的习俗工作。 </p><p> We walked outside to Fong’s wide, sunny deck so that we could remove our masks. Buigues took a seat on a lawn chair and Ernie hopped up beside her. She slowly ran her hands along his spine, twisting his tail slightly this way and that. “There we go,” she’d say. “Let it out.” And Ernie would emit a great big yawn, or a yelp, or a prolonged, chirruping cry. Then he’d leap up and spin in place or circle the deck before coming back for more.</p><p>我们走到外面到Fong的阳光灿烂的甲板，以便我们可以去除我们的面具。 Buigues在草坪椅子上坐在座位上，厄尼跳到她旁边。她慢慢地沿着他的脊柱跑了双手，以这种方式略微扭曲他的尾巴。 “我们走了，”她说。 “说出来。”厄尼会发出一个大的大哈欠，或yelp，或延长的吱吱声哭泣。然后他在回来之前跳跃并旋转到位或圈出甲板。</p><p> It did seem as though he was speaking to her, and that she, in turn, was deciphering messages lodged deep inside his body. The yawns and cries, Buigues explained, were emotional releases, similar to what humans might emit during a particularly intense massage or chiropractic alignment. Yet Buigues was barely touching him. Eventually, as she was working on him, he fell into a deep, unmovable sleep. After one more adjustment, he awoke and, with a small bark, signaled to Buigues that he was done.</p><p> 似乎似乎他正在和她谈到，而且她又发言，正在破译留下在他的身体内部的内心。 Buigues解释说，打哈欠和哭泣，是情绪释放，类似于人类在特别强烈的按摩或脊椎按摩术中发出的东西。然而，Buigues几乎没有碰到他。最终，正如她在他努力的那样，他陷入了深深，不可移动的睡眠。经过一次调整之后，他醒了，醒来，用小树皮，发出了他所做的buigues。</p><p> “Isn’t it amazing?” Fong asked me as we watched Buigues. Ernie was a stiff dog who often hobbled on his walks. Thinking it could do no harm, Fong had conscripted Buigues for help. “I didn’t believe in any of this crap,” she said. “But then you just see it, and you know. She has a gift.” After the treatments, Fong said, Ernie runs like a puppy again. This was no illusion. Buigues was doing something, even if it wasn’t flashy or grand. It felt like a quiet little miracle.</p><p> “这不是惊人吗？”当我们看着Buigues时，Fong问我。厄尼是一只常见的狗，往往蹒跚而行。思考它可能没有伤害，奉征了征求帮助。 “我不相信任何垃圾，”她说。 “但是你只是看到它，你知道。她有一份礼物。“在治疗之后，Fong说，厄尼再次像小狗一样奔跑。这没有错觉。 Buigues也在做点什么，即使它不满或盛大。它感觉就像一个安静的小奇迹。</p><p> When I asked her to decode what was happening as she drew her hands along Ernie’s spine, Buigues struggled to explain it, as if interpreting another language. She was following the currents of his energy, she said, attempting to unravel metaphysical knots and twists. She understood the limitations of her explanation, but that was the best she could do. It was just something she felt.</p><p> 当我让她解散正在发生的事情时，当她沿着厄尼的脊椎引起双手时，Buigues努力解释它，就像解释另一种语言一样。她说，她正在追随他的能量的潮流，试图解开形而上学结和曲折。她了解她解释的局限性，但这是她能做的最好的。这只是她觉得的东西。</p><p> For most people who purport to communicate with animals, the ability is considered a lost art, something that was widely practiced before the advent of modernity, before mechanization and urbanization. This was, in part, a matter of necessity: reading animals helped humans evade predators, find prey, and monitor the needs of livestock. As the balance between humans and the nonhuman world has shifted, the thinking goes, we have become less attuned to natural signals—which isn’t to say that one can’t recover and master these skills today. “If you’re quiet, you’ll hear them,” Buigues told me.</p><p> 对于旨在与动物沟通的大多数人来说，这种能力被认为是一个迷失的艺术，在机械化和城市化之前在现代性出现之前广泛实践的东西。部分是，部分是必要的：阅读动物有助于人类逃避捕食者，找到猎物，并监测牲畜的需求。随着人类与非人类世界之间的平衡已经转变，思考是，我们已经变得越来越少地对自然信号 - 这并不是说今天无法恢复和掌握这些技能。 “如果你很安静，你会听到他们，”Buigues告诉我。</p><p> “I think every single person has the ability to communicate with animals,” Marji Lee Pearson, an animal healer based in Mill Valley, explained. “But for many people, their minds are so busy, they never stop, they’re always on their computer or their phone.” Laura Stinchfield, something of a celebrity among animal mediums, told me, “If they would just get quiet and centered, and just sit with the animal, they would pick up exactly what the animal feels and what the animal is saying.” Stinchfield, who calls herself the Pet Psychic, appears frequently on the TV show  AnimalZone, in which she travels across California to help resolve conflicts between pets and their humans, stunning owners with her ability to read their animals’ minds. “Empathetic people are doing this all the time,” she said. “They just don’t realize it.”</p><p> “我认为每个人都有能力与动物进行沟通，”磨坊山谷的动物治疗师“马吉李皮尔森解释说。 “但对于许多人来说，他们的思想是如此忙碌，他们永远不会停止，他们总是在他们的电脑或他们的手机上。” Laura Stinchfield，动物媒介中的一个名人，告诉我，“如果他们只是安静和集中，那么就像动物一样，他们会恰好拿起动物的感觉和动物所说的内容。” STINCHFIELD呼叫自己是宠物灵，常常在电视节目中展出，在电视节目中，她在加利福尼亚州旅行，帮助解决宠物和他们的人类之间的冲突，令人振奋的主人能够阅读他们的动物的思想。 “同情的人一直这样做，”她说。 “他们只是没有意识到这一点。”</p><p> Magical thinking had a particular appeal in the early months of the pandemic, but so did the clarity of science. I wrote to Frans de Waal, a leading primatologist, asking whether he’d be willing to discuss the potential scientific underpinnings of the kind of communication I’d witnessed between Buigues and Ernie. I received a quick response: “But I am sorry I don’t believe in telepathy.” It was all he wrote. I persisted, however, and he kindly agreed to talk to me about what, from his perspective, I had seen.</p><p> 神奇的思维在大流行早期有一个特殊的上诉，但科学的清晰度也是如此。我写信给一个领先的原始学家Frans de Waal，询问他是否愿意讨论我在Buigues和Ernie之间目睹的沟通的潜在科学的基础。我收到了一个快速的回应：“但对不起，我不相信心灵感应。”这是他写的。然而，我坚持，而且他善意与我谈论什么，从他看来，我看过。 </p><p> De Waal is a specialist in ethology, the biological study of animal behavior, a field that emerged in the 1930s. In contrast to behaviorism, which asserts that animal behavior can be explained in terms of incentives, rewards, and punishments, ethology posits that animals are innately intelligent, rather than simply programmable. It has only somewhat recently been considered mainstream science. “I had trouble with the idea that animal behavior could be reduced to a history of incentives,” de Waal wrote of his early days as a biology student. “It presented animals as passive, whereas I view them as seeking, wanting, and striving.”</p><p>De Waal是歌曲学的专家，动物行为的生物学研究，在20世纪30年代出现的领域。与行为主义相比，这声明了动物行为可以在激励，奖励和惩罚方面解释，动物是动物是聪明的，而不是简单的可编程。它只最近被认为是主流科学的某种程度上。 “我对动物行为可以减少到激励历史的想法有困难，”De Waal将他的早期作为生物学学生写道。 “它将动物呈现为被动，而我将他们视为寻求，想要和努力。”</p><p> I recounted Adam and Dani’s story and asked de Waal whether he could explain what had happened. In response, he told me about the widely discredited biologist Rupert Sheldrake, who coined the term “morphic resonance” for a theoretical exchange of feelings and knowledge between animals through time and space. According to this idea, rats would pass a test more easily if nearby rats had already passed that same test; dogs would know when their humans would walk back in through the door no matter the schedule they kept; and pigeons would be connected to their home via “something rather like an invisible elastic band.” De Waal explained that another scientist had tested Sheldrake’s theory by building a roost for pigeons on a truck bed. When he moved the truck out of sight, the pigeons found themselves homeless; they couldn’t trace their way back. “You need controlled experiments,” said de Waal. “And as soon as you do them, they fall apart.”</p><p> 我讲述了亚当和达尼的故事，并问到了他是否可以解释发生了什么。作为回应，他告诉我有关广泛信誉的生物学家Rupert Sheldrake，他们通过时间和空间来说，为动物的理论交流和动物之间的理论交流和知识。根据这个想法，如果附近的老鼠已经通过了同样的测试，大鼠将更容易地通过测试;无论他们保存的时间表，狗都会知道他们的人类何时会通过门口回来;和鸽子将通过“某种不可见弹性乐队的东西”连接到他们的家。 De Waal解释说，另一个科学家通过在卡车床上建造鸽子的栖息地测试了Sheldrake的理论。当他搬出视线时，鸽子发现自己无家可归;他们无法追溯到他们的路。 “你需要受控实验，”德沃尔说。 “一旦你这样做，他们就会崩溃。”</p><p> To ethologists such as de Waal, some animal communicators are classic grifters, manipulating their marks by inferring the obvious or telling them what they want to hear. (One famous pet psychic told me that my cat was exceedingly handsome and then proceeded to insist on just how stunningly well-behaved he was—mere hours after my husband had stepped in a steaming pile of cat shit on our living-room floor.) But biologists, like psychics, tend to believe that we vastly underestimate animal intelligence and the intricacy of their emotional worlds. Animals can cry and joke; they can hold celebrations and burials; they feel jealousy and monogamous love. Many animals understand justice and unfairness (a baboon will be happy with lettuce for a reward until he sees that his friend has been given grapes, a far tastier prize). A trendsetting Zimbabwean chimpanzee named Julie once decorated her ear with a blade of grass, and fellow chimps adopted the fashion as though she were a middle school It Girl. Bowerbirds, meanwhile, adorn their homes with attractive objects in order to entice a mate, painting rocks with berry juice to make them more beautiful. Dolphins call one another by name, while chickadees and prairie dogs form complex words using a kind of additive grammar. Crows recognize the particular proclivities of their beloveds, and, as I now know, seek retribution for perceived harm.</p><p> 对于De Waal等哲学家，一些动物沟通者是经典的Grifters，通过推断出明显或告诉他们他们想要听到的东西来操纵他们的标记。 （一位着名的宠物精神告诉我，我的猫非常帅气，然后继续坚持我在我丈夫在客房楼上踩到一堆猫屎之后，他是多么惊人的表现。）但像心理学一样的生物学家倾向于相信，我们非常低估了动物情报和情绪世界的复杂性。动物可以哭泣和笑话;他们可以举行庆祝活动和埋葬;他们觉得嫉妒和一夫一妻制。许多动物了解正义和不公平（一个狒狒对生菜为奖励，直到他认为他的朋友已经被葡萄，远景奖）。一个名叫朱莉的趋势津巴布韦黑猩猩曾经用一刃装饰着她的耳朵，他的丛生采用了时尚，好像她是一个中学的它。与此同时，波格鸟用有吸引力的物品装饰着他们的家，以诱使伴侣用浆果汁绘制岩石，让他们更加美丽。海豚按名称互相呼叫，而鹰雀和草原狗使用一种添加剂语法形成复杂的词语。乌鸦认识到他们心爱爱人的特定倾向，而且，正如我所知道的那样，寻求报应的伤害。</p><p> Animals communicate in myriad verbal and nonverbal languages, de Waal emphasized, which humans are capable of learning to decipher. Likewise, animals pick up on human cues for their own protection, and out of something like love. “Animal intelligence is beautiful enough, amazing enough,” de Waal told me. “You don’t need to add fictional elements to it. It’s already by itself quite remarkable.”</p><p> 动物在无数言语和非语言语言中沟通，De Waal强调，人类能够学习破译。同样，动物拿起人类提示，为自己的保护，出于爱情的东西。 “动物智慧足够美丽，令人惊叹，”de waal告诉我。 “您不需要向其添加虚构元素。它已经本身非常出色。“</p><p>  De Waal, Buigues, and the psychics I spoke with ultimately agreed on one thing: communicating with animals requires deep, sustained attention. The pandemic has established favorable conditions for this kind of communion. For those of us who aren’t essential workers, time has slowed, our vision has shrunk to that which is visible outside our newly compelling windows or inside our drastically reduced interiors. The hummingbirds transformed from backyard attractions into potential companions, even</p><p>  De Waal，Buigues和我谈到的心理学，最终同意一件事：与动物沟通需要深入，持续关注。大流行为这种圣餐建立了有利的条件。对于那些不是必不可少的工人而言，时间已经放缓，我们的愿景已经缩小到我们新推动的窗户外或在我们急剧减少的内部内部可见。蜂鸟从后院景点转变为潜在的伴侣，甚至</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/04/the-crow-whisperer-animal-communicators/">https://harpers.org/archive/2021/04/the-crow-whisperer-animal-communicators/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/悄悄话/">#悄悄话</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/whisperer/">#whisperer</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/乌鸦/">#乌鸦</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
