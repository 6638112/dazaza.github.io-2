In one instance, movies were played without music.\n  The research subjects, all UC Davis undergraduate and graduate students, were subsequently asked to remember as many details as they could from each movie as the music played. They were also quizzed about their recollection of the associated tunes and how often they experienced each of the tunes as an earworm. None of them had formal music training.\n   The results: the more often a tune played in a person\u2019s head, the more accurate the memory for the tune became and, critically, the more details the person remembered from the specific section of the movie with which the tune was paired.\n With only one week between when they saw the movie, and when they were asked to remember as many details from the movie as they could while listening to the movie soundtrack, the effect of repeatedly experiencing a tune from the soundtrack as an earworm resulted in near-perfect retention of the movie details.\n These people\u2019s memories, in fact, were as good as when they had first seen the movie. Additionally, most subjects were able to report what they were typically doing when their earworms occurred, and none of them mentioned the associated movies coming to mind at those times.\n \u201cOur paper shows that even if you are playing that song in your mind and not pulling up details of memories explicitly, that is still going to help solidify those memories,\u201d Janata said.\n \u201cWe typically think of earworms as random nuisance beyond our control, but our results show that earworms are a naturally occurring memory process that helps preserve recent experiences in long-term memory,\u201d Kubit said.\n   The authors said they hope the research, which is ongoing, could eventually lead to the development of nonpharmaceutical, music-based interventions to help people suffering from dementia and other neurological disorders to better remember events, people and daily tasks.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 02:42:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5e2e\u52a9,stuck,\u8bb0\u5fc6", "title": "\u90a3\u9996\u6b4c\u5361\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u8111\u6d77\u91cc\u6b63\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u5927\u8111\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6 ", "title_en": "That Song Stuck in Your Head Is Helping the Brain with Long-Term Memory", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/that-song-is-stuck-in-your-head-but-its-helping-you-to-remember/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e2e\u52a9", "stuck", "\u8bb0\u5fc6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066737, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "1989-12-31T20\uff1a00\uff1a27-05\uff1a00 https://images.c-span.org/files/4fe/19891231200933001_hd.jpg rutgers\u5927\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u6559\u6388\u5a01\u5ec9\u00b7\u83b1\u5179\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684T\u4e66\u53cc\u8bed\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u6b3a\u9a97\u4f60\u3002\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53cc\u8bed\u4f8b\u5b50\u662f\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u201d\u4ee3\u66ff\u201c\u4f53\u80b2\u201d\uff0c\u201c\u4eba\u884c\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u201d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u201c\u5751\u6d3c\u201d\u3002\u53cc\u8bed\u662f\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u3002 Lutz\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\u4e0d\u662f\u6839\u9664\u53cc\u8bed\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6d88\u9664\u4ece\u6700\u5371\u9669\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002\u4ed6\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u4e2d\u6700\u666e\u904d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u7d27\u968f\u5176\u540e\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u884c\u4e1a\u3002 Rutgers\u5927\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u6559\u6388William Lutz\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684T\u4e66\u53cc\u8bed\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6765\u6b3a\u9a97\u4f60\u3002\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5206\u6790\uff0c...\u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a\n \u62a5\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u53d1\u884c\u623f\u5c4b\u5f53\u524d\u8bb2\u8bdd\u8005\u7684\u623f\u5c4b\u4ee3\u8868\u3002\u6258\u9a6c\u65afFoley\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u56de\u987e\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u9762\u8bd5\u4e2d1968\u5e74\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6......\n \u524d\u6559\u80b2\u79d8\u4e66Bennett\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ed6\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u6240\u6709\u513f\u7ae5\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u6559\u5bfc\u7684\u7f8e\u5fb7......\n \u54c1\u724c\u5148\u751f\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u4e66\uff0c\u9c81\u83bd\u5341\u5e74\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u57281890\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u7531\u5723\u9a6c\u4e01\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u4ed6\u2026\n Michael Elliott\u8c08\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e66\uff0c\u6628\u5929\u524d\u4e00\u5929\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0......

The report, co-authored by academics at the Business School (formerly Cass), King&#39;s Business School, and the University of Malta, finds that the reliance on   in decision-making might be counterproductive as this reduces decision-making speed without ensuring more accuracy.\n  The research, based on information from 122 advertising, digital, publishing, and  , finds that using data to inform decision making under high uncertainty is often not optimal. This may explain why 12 different publishers initially rejected the opportunity to publish &#34;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone&#39; \u2013 because it had no data to inform its potential.\n  A  recent survey revealed that 92 percent of Fortune 1000 companies were reporting increased investment in data initiatives, although it appears this may not always be necessary.\n  The authors asked   how they made decisions on their most recent innovation project, including the extent to which they used data, instinct, and other simple heuristics (mental strategies). The findings outlined that among those decision-making methods were:\n  Managers were asked whether they think they made the   and how fast they were in reaching that decision. Results showed that managers relied on their own   as much as data, using &#39;tallying&#39; more than any other metric.\n  Dr. Oguz A. Acar, Reader in Marketing at the Business School and co-author of the report, said: &#34;This research shows that data-driven decision-making is not the panacea in all situations and may not result in increased accuracy when facing uncertainty.\n  &#34;Under extreme uncertainty, managers, particularly those with more experience, should trust the expertise and instincts that have propelled them to such a position.

From launch through June 3, more Roku active accounts streamed a Roku Original than the number of Quibi accounts that streamed Quibi shows during the start-up\u2019s entire run.\n Launched in April 2020 with $1.75 billion in financing, Quibi failed to gain traction with its subscription mobile service, shuttering by the fall. Roku had already been in discussions with Quibi about potential distribution, as the company saw its mobile-only focus floundering, in part due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n  Shows featuring Kevin Hart, Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lopez and other stars were made in a shortened episodic format befitting Quibi\u2019s name, which is short for \u201cquick bites.\u201d Those seven-to-10-minute running times happen to line up well with Roku\u2019s ad breaks.\n The company did not offer a specific number for the viewing of originals, but said a record number of accounts watched during the first two weeks of availability. More than one in three users of The   streamed a Roku Originals series, with users streaming over nine episodes on average. The Roku Channel reaches households with 70 million people. Roku has about 54 million active accounts.\n Roku has not previously offered an estimate for its investment in programming, but insiders familiar with the company\u2019s finances say it is approaching $1 billion in spending on content. That figure covers both library acquisitions and originals. Plans don\u2019t call for a dramatic ramp-up to Netflix levels of financial commitment but even at a more modest level Roku is punching well above its weight. Roku recently ordered a second season of Kevin Hart\u2019s action comedy series  Die Hart.\n In addition to Quibi, the company has also in recent months acquired the This Old House home improvement brand and set a pay-1 windows deal with Saban Films. It maintains a library of 40,000-plus on-demand film and TV titles on the Roku Channel, which launched in 2017. It also features nearly 200 live linear channels. Most of the programming on the Roku Channel is free and ad-supported, but the platform also enables viewers to sign up for premium services.\n  Within the Roku Channel, the top 10 most watched programs were all Roku Originals in the May 20-June 3 span, the company said.\n The viewing insights come as founder and CEO Anthony Wood appears today at the Tribeca Festival during a sidebar event called Tribeca X. The in-person event blends tech, advertising and entertainment.\n \u201cWe always believed Roku Originals would perform exceptionally well as free, ad-supported entertainment on The Roku Channel.\u201d Roku VP of programming Rob Holmes said in a press release. \u201cThe first two weeks have surpassed our expectations, with millions of people streaming Roku Originals, and provided a further demonstration of The Roku Channel flywheel, with great content driving record engagement that\u2019s appealing to advertisers seeking to reach the streaming audience.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 00:51:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "quibi,roku", "title": "Roku\u4ece5\u670820\u65e5\u52306\u67083\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684Roku\u89c2\u4f17\u5c06\u4eceQuibi\u7528\u6237\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u64ad\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aRoku\u539f\u59cb\u7684\uff0cQuibi\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fd1\u4e5d\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u5bff\u547d\u671f\u95f4\u663e\u793a\u4e86Quibi ", "title_en": "Roku says from May 20 to June 3, more Roku viewers streamed a Roku Original than Quibi users who streamed Quibi shows during the nine months of Quibi's lifetime", "transed": 1, "url": "https://deadline.com/2021/06/roku-originals-quibi-streaming-one-billion-1234777771/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["quibi", "roku"]}]
