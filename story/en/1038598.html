But in March, on leave from her job as a flight attendant with American Airlines and cooped up alone in her Philadelphia apartment, the 34-year-old taught herself to sew. Soon, she was stitching masks and donating them to health care workers.</p><p>大流行开始时，Kat Panchal尚未学习如何使用缝纫机。但是在三月份，这位34岁的年轻人在离开美国航空乘务员的工作后独自一人住在费城的公寓里，自学成衣。不久，她缝了口罩，并将其捐赠给医护人员。</p><p> With no sign of her job coming back anytime soon, Ms. Panchal — now furloughed — put her masks on Etsy, the online marketplace where crafters and artists around the globe sell handmade and vintage goods. Since April, she has sold more than 400 masks, raking in over $4,500. Sometimes, she sews until 4 in the morning to keep up with demand.</p><p> 潘查尔（Panchal）现已休假，她的工作很快就没有回来的迹象，她将自己的面具戴在Etsy（在线市场）上，全世界的手工艺品商和艺术家在这里出售手工和古董。自四月以来，她已经卖出了400多个口罩，收入超过4,500美元。有时，她会缝到早上4点才能跟上需求。</p><p> “It was a really big blessing,” Ms. Panchal said. “It gave me something else to focus on instead of thinking about losing my job.”</p><p> 潘查尔女士说：“这真是一个很大的祝福。” “这给了我其他方面需要关注的事情，而不是考虑失业。”</p><p> Tens of millions of masks have been sold on Etsy this year. The demand has created business opportunities for the likes of Ms. Panchal, but has also turned Etsy into something unexpected: a Wall Street darling.</p><p> 今年，Etsy已售出了数以千万计的口罩。需求为潘查尔（Panchal）女士等人创造了商机，但也使Etsy变成了意想不到的东西：华尔街宠儿。</p><p> Along with a cluster of “stay at home” stocks like Zoom Video, Peloton and Shopify — so called because their businesses took off during the pandemic as people’s shopping and work habits changed — Etsy has seen its share price soar. More than 90 percent of Wall Street analysts rate the stock a “buy.” Individual investors, mutual fund managers and hedge fund traders alike have been scooping up its shares, which have risen more than 250 percent this year. That makes Etsy by far the best-performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 stock index, to which it was added in September — a sign that it was now in the corporate big leagues.</p><p> Etsy的股票价格飞涨，再加上诸如Zoom Video，Peloton和Shopify之类的“呆在家里”的股票，之所以如此，是因为随着人们购物和工作习惯的改变，他们的业务在大流行期间起飞。超过90％的华尔街分析师将这只股票定为“买入”。个人投资者，共同基金经理和对冲基金交易员都一直在抢购其股票，今年以来其股价已上涨了250％以上。这使得Etsy成为9月份加入标准普尔500指数中表现最好的股票-这表明它现在已经进入了企业大联盟。</p><p>  Such blue-chip status would have seemed like a long shot just a couple of years ago for a company that began in 2005 as a site for a founder to sell handmade wood-clad computers, only to become a punchline for an emergent twee culture that values idealism, niceness and sincerity. By 2015, when Etsy went public, it had morphed into a crusader for socially conscious capitalism. In its offering documents to investors, Etsy promoted its do-gooder credentials almost as much as its business prospects.</p><p>  对于一家成立于2005年的公司来说，这种蓝筹股的地位似乎只是几年前的远景，该公司最初是一家创始人出售手工木制电脑的网站，但后来却成为新兴的三通文化的标杆重视理想主义，友善和真诚。到2015年，Etsy上市时，它已演变成具有社会意识的资本主义的十字军。在向投资者提供的文件中，Etsy宣传了其良好信誉，几乎与业务前景一样。</p><p> And while it treated investors to an unusual level of disclosure on its corporate composting practices, Etsy’s chief executive at the time, Chad Dickerson, flatly declared the company wouldn’t issue guidance on expected quarterly profits. The practice “is misaligned with Etsy’s mission,” which was to create a new kind of company that wouldn’t follow the conventional corporate path of “valuing products and profits over community,” Mr. Dickerson wrote.</p><p> 尽管Etsy的首席执行官查德·迪克森（Chad Dickerson）曾以特殊寻常的程度将其公司堆肥操作的信息披露给投资者，但他断然宣布该公司不会发布有关预期季度利润的指导。 Dickerson先生写道，这种做法“与Etsy的使命不符”，后者的目的是创建一种新型的公司，而不遵循传统的“通过社区评估产品和利润来评估产品”的公司路径。 </p><p>  After Etsy produced a series of ugly losses over the next year, its share price plummeted almost 80 percent. Buyout firms and activist hedge funds began to circle, snapping up shares and pushing the company to explore “strategic alternatives” — such as selling itself.</p><p>在明年Etsy造成一系列丑陋的亏损之后，其股价暴跌了近80％。收购公司和激进的对冲基金开始盘旋，抢购股票并推动公司探索“战略选择”，例如出售自己。</p><p> Etsy eventually bowed to Wall Street. In May 2017, the board ousted Mr. Dickerson, and the company axed 8 percent of its work force and committed to a change in strategy. A board member, Josh Silverman — a former executive at eBay and Skype — was named chief executive, and the company issued a statement saying it was “focused on maximizing value for all shareholders.”</p><p> Etsy最终屈服于华尔街。 2017年5月，董事会罢免了迪克森先生，该公司裁员了8％，并承诺改变战略。 eBay和Skype的前高管乔什·西尔弗曼（Josh Silverman）被任命为首席执行官，该公司发表声明说，公司“专注于为所有股东创造最大价值”。</p><p> In other words, it was ready to play by at least some of Wall Street’s rules.</p><p> 换句话说，它已经准备好按照华尔街的某些规则进行游戏了。</p><p> More changes were to come, including bigger layoffs. Projects that had been in the works for months were shuttered. The Values-Aligned Business division, which was tasked with ensuring that the company’s socially conscious ethics were ingrained into every aspect of the company, was broken up and reorganized. In 2017, it ceased being a B Corp — a certification given by a private nonprofit organization to companies with high social and environmental consciousness — which it had promoted as being crucial to its brand just two years earlier.</p><p> 将会有更多的变化，包括更大的裁员。已经进行了几个月的项目被关闭。价值观统一业务部门的职责是确保公司的社会意识道德根植于公司的各个方面，并进行了重组。 2017年，它不再是B公司，这是一家私人非营利组织向具有高度社会和环境意识的公司颁发的证书，两年前它就被提升为对其品牌至关重要的认证。</p><p> While the changes weren’t without controversy,  especially internally, Etsy officials say the company has significantly amplified its focus on corporate values since the management change. Mr. Silverman has brought an M.B.A.-style approach, refocusing the company on a few key issues — economic empowerment, gender and racial diversity and carbon neutrality — where, he argues, Etsy can make real progress.</p><p> 尽管变革并非没有争议，尤其是在内部，但Etsy官员表示，自管理层变更以来，该公司已大大扩大了对公司价值的关注。西尔弗曼（Silverman）先生采用了MBA风格的方法，将公司重新聚焦于几个关键问题-经济赋权，性别和种族多样性以及碳中和-他认为Etsy可以在其中取得真正的进步。</p><p>  “I am more proud of what we’ve done on social impact than I am of the share price,” Mr. Silverman said in an interview. “Now, I’m nervous about that quote because that implies that they’re somehow not related. And I very much believe that the great performance that we have is in no small measure because we have focused so much on citizenship” — a term Mr. Silverman used to describe the company’s efforts around social and cultural goals.</p><p>  希尔弗曼在接受采访时说：“我为我们在社会影响方面所做的努力比为股价感到自豪。” “现在，我对该报价感到不安，因为这意味着它们之间不存在某种联系。我非常相信，我们的出色表现在很大程度上要归功于我们对公民身份的关注。”这是西尔弗曼先生用来形容公司围绕社会和文化目标所做的努力。</p><p> Analysts and investors say Etsy’s progress on operational challenges, from payments to search to shipping, has been more important to their changing views on the stock than management’s efforts around corporate culture.</p><p> 分析师和投资者表示，Etsy在从付款到搜索再到运输的运营挑战方面取得的进展，对于他们对股票的看法变化而言，比管理层围绕企业文化所做的努力更为重要。 </p><p> Before Mr. Silverman’s arrival, Etsy’s homespun approach extended to its own operations; it stored and managed its data on its own servers rather than moving them to a decentralized cloud, as was the industry norm. A clunky payments processing system and pages that loaded slowly bogged down shoppers.</p><p>在西尔弗曼（Silverman）先生到任之前，埃兹（Etsy）的朴素做法扩展到了自己的业务。它将数据存储和管理在自己的服务器上，而不是像行业规范那样将其移动到分散的云中。笨拙的付款处理系统和加载缓慢的页面使购物者陷入困境。</p><p> Search was also a challenge for Etsy, whose handmade and often idiosyncratic items didn’t fit into intuitive and standardized search queries, frustrating would-be buyers who ultimately clicked away. That kept the share of people who made purchases on the site, versus those who merely visited — a metric that investors watch known as the conversion rate — low.</p><p> 对于Etsy来说，搜索也是一个挑战，Etsy的手工制作的商品（通常是特殊商品）不适合直观且标准化的搜索查询，这使最终点击的潜在买家感到沮丧。相对于那些只访问过网站的人来说，这使得网站上购买商品的人的比例较低（投资者将其称为转化率）。</p><p> “You had these buyers come, but they couldn’t find what they needed, or they didn’t know what they were looking for,” said Chris Mack, a stock portfolio manager at the investment adviser Harding Loevner in Bridgewater, N.J., who owned a roughly $17 million stake in Etsy for his funds, according to the most recent public filings.</p><p> 新泽西州布里奇沃特的投资顾问哈丁·洛夫纳（Harding Loevner）的股票投资组合经理克里斯·麦克（Chris Mack）说：“您吸引了这些买家，但他们找不到他们所需要的东西，或者他们不知道自己在寻找什么。”根据最近的公开文件显示，他拥有Etsy大约1700万美元的股份。</p><p> When they did buy, Etsy customers were often annoyed by high shipping costs and long waits for the products to arrive. Some delays were unavoidable. Unlike Amazon, Etsy doesn’t own warehouses stocked with inventory. Most of the items sold on the site are made to order for individual buyers, a process that defies the kind of next-day-delivery many online consumers have come to expect. (Etsy takes a 5 percent cut of sales.)</p><p> 当他们购买时，Etsy客户通常会因高昂的运输成本和长时间等待产品到达而感到烦恼。有些延误是不可避免的。与亚马逊不同，Etsy没有拥有库存的仓库。该网站上出售的大多数商品都是按订单定购的，这一过程违背了许多在线消费者期望的第二天交付方式。 （Etsy削减了5％的销售额。）</p><p> As Etsy began to find its financial footing, sales grew faster and its overhead costs fell. It migrated back-end operations to Google’s Cloud services unit, tapping into the bigger company’s search expertise and increasing processing speed.</p><p> 随着Etsy开始找到财务基础，销售增长更快，间接费用成本下降。它将后端业务迁移到Google的云服务部门，从而利用了大公司的搜索专业知识并提高了处理速度。</p><p> Etsy ended 2017 with a more than 70 percent jump in its stock price as it turned profits, and shares continued to climb the next year. However, Wall Street remained uncertain, and the company’s shares traded wildly through 2019 as it posted disappointing financial results. (Etsy’s chief financial officer, Rachel Glaser, is on the board of The New York Times Company.)</p><p> Etsy在2017年结束时因扭亏为盈而股价上涨了70％以上，第二年股价继续攀升。然而，华尔街仍然不确定，该公司的股票在2019年之前一直表现不佳，其财务业绩令人失望。 （Etsy的首席财务官Rachel Glaser是《纽约时报》的董事会成员。）</p><p>  Then, in April, came the mask boom. Almost immediately after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face coverings, mask searches exploded on the site, with nine searches every second during the first weekend of the month. As frantic buyers cleaned out store shelves and warehouse supplies of industrially manufactured masks, many turned to Etsy in search of handmade options.</p><p>  然后，在四月，面具热潮来了。在疾病控制和预防中心推荐遮盖脸面之后，现场几乎立即展开了口罩搜索，在该月的第一个周末每秒进行九次搜索。当疯狂的买主清理工业制造口罩的货架和仓库用品时，许多人转向Etsy寻找手工制作的选择。 </p><p> “It was like waking up and discovering that it was Cyber Monday, except that everyone in the world wanted just one product and that one product was in extremely limited supply,” Mr. Silverman, the Etsy chief, told analysts.</p><p>Etsy负责人西尔弗曼（Silverman）告诉分析师：“这就像醒来，发现那是网络星期一，只是世界上每个人都只想要一种产品，而且一种产品的供应极为有限。”</p><p> Since the start of April, the site has sold nearly 54 million masks, worth $600 million, and the boom has proved surprisingly durable, helping to supercharge key profit and sales metrics at the company. In the third quarter, the total value of goods sold on the site, excluding masks, was also up 93 percent, as housebound Americans bought home furnishings, craft supplies, jewelry and accessories.</p><p> 自4月初以来，该基地已经售出了近5400万个口罩，价值6亿美元，而且这种繁荣已经证明是持久的，有助于提高公司的主要利润和销售指标。在第三季度，由于无家可归的美国人购买了家具，手工艺品，珠宝和配件，该网站上销售的商品总价值（不包括口罩）也增长了93％。</p><p> Wall Street was impressed with Etsy’s ability to handle the surge of mask orders — which required flexible computing power, on-the-fly-tweaking of search abilities and a demanding pace for shipping — and it shone a spotlight on the strides the company had made.</p><p> Etsy处理口罩订单激增的能力给华尔街留下了深刻的印象，这需要灵活的计算能力，即时的搜索能力和苛刻的运输速度，这也使该公司取得了长足的进步。</p><p> “What they’ve been able to use Covid for is to bring either new customers to the platform or old customers back to a better experience,” said Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, who covers Etsy. “When you searched something, you actually found it. Or when you bought something, it actually came, like, pretty quickly, not weeks later, which was some of the issues with what we’ll call the old Etsy.”</p><p> Oppenheimer＆amp; amp;分析师Jason Helfstein说：“他们能够使用Covid的目的是将新客户带到平台上，或将旧客户带回更好的体验。”涵盖Etsy的公司。 “当您搜索某物时，您实际上找到了它。或者，当您购买某件东西时，它实际上很快就出现了，而不是几周后，这就是我们称为旧Etsy的一些问题。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/华尔街/">#华尔街</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/文化/">#文化</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/twee/">#twee</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
