Using a stream-of-consciousness style to describe twenty-four hours in the life of a lower-middle class Dubliner named Leopold Bloom, Joyce\u2019s classic, published in 1922, was brilliant, dense, convoluted, complex, and legally obscene.  Ulysses was the \u201conly volume of literary importance still under a ban\u201d in the country, Morris Ernst declared. He set out to \u201cliberate\u201d it, and the celebrated case, resolved by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1934, was not only a landmark in the law of literary censorship but also a turning point in Ernst\u2019s career.\n    Joyce\u2019s novel had a long history of suppression in the United States. Ulysses had been banned even before Joyce finished writing it. In 1918, as he was completing  Ulysses, Joyce sent chapters to the New York\u2013based literary magazine the Little Review, which published them in installments. The Post Office Department confiscated the issues and burned them. Shortly after, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice had obscenity charges brought against the Review\u2019s editors for having published the chapter in which Bloom masturbates while watching a young woman on the beach. John Quinn, a noted literary lawyer and patron of the arts, defended the editors in court. Despite Quinn\u2019s persuasive argument\u2014Ulysses was so dense and convoluted that no one could possibly understand it, much less be debauched by it, he argued\u2014a three-judge panel, using the Hicklin test, concluded that the book had the potential to corrupt youth and was therefore obscene. After the New York decision, no American publisher was willing to take a chance on  Ulysses. The book was eventually issued in Paris in 1922, under the imprint of the avant-garde bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Joyce gave Sylvia Beach, the bookstore\u2019s proprietor, the world rights to Ulysses.\n The ban on the book notwithstanding, Ulysses found a wide and receptive audience in the United States. Blue paperbound copies were smuggled into the country and sold at fantastic prices, sometimes as much as fifty dollars. Joyce won critical acclaim for Ulysses; articles and treatises were written about it, its style was widely imitated, and the book achieved masterpiece status. Observed critic Harry Hansen in 1933, a generation of Americans coming of age in the 1920s grew up \u201cwith the idea that [Ulysses] is a literary Bible.\u201d\n Because Ulysses could not be legally published in the United States, it could not be copyrighted. Samuel Roth, an infamous publisher of pornography, seized on this opportunity and began to publish bowdlerized installments of Ulysses in his magazine Two Worlds Monthly. Joyce sued Roth over the unconsented use of his name. One hundred sixty-seven of Joyce\u2019s literary friends, including T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Mann, signed a petition protesting the \u201cappropriation and mutilation\u201d of Joyce\u2019s work. Joyce won an injunction in 1927. Meanwhile, US Customs officials seized copies of the book that were imported from Paris. In 1928, the US Customs Court, in an action titled A. Heymoolen v. United States, affirmed the exclusion of Ulysses as an obscene book.\n  Joyce, who was living in Paris, launched a search for a reputable American publisher. Aging, syphilitic, and nearly blind, he was desperate for money, and it was rumored that Roth was going to sell another pirated edition, publishing as many as twenty thousand copies. A few US publishers, sensitive to the changing cultural climate around sex and the more liberal obscenity rulings in the New York courts, began to discuss the possibility of bringing out an American edition of  Ulysses. But no one was willing to commit to it; with the legal restrictions in place, publishing  Ulysses was a still a risky proposition. Ernst knew about the renewed interest in  Ulysses, and in the summer of 1931 he had asked Alexander Lindey to help him find a publisher that might be willing to publish the book and cooperate in a test case to remove the ban. Ernst planned to deploy the same strategy he had used in the Contraception and Married Love cases\u2014he would have a copy of Ulysses imported from France and seized by the Customs Office under the Tariff Act as an obscene book, and then he would challenge the seizure.\n  In August, Lindey had a lengthy conversation with Sylvia Beach\u2019s sister, Holly Beach Denis, about the possibility of an American publisher obtaining the rights and participating in the \u201clegalization of Ulysses.\u201d Denis said that she was \u201ctremendously interested\u201d and that Sylvia Beach would likely cooperate if a suitable publisher could be found. Shortly after, Lindey wrote to Ernst, \u201cI . . . feel very keenly that this would be the grandest obscenity case in the history of law and literature, and I am ready to do anything in the world to get it started. What do you suggest?\u201d\n \u201cTell Mrs. Denis that I want to see her,\u201d Ernst replied. \u201cI am sure I can get a good publisher.\u201d\n Two months later, Ernst lunched with Ben Huebsch, ACLU member and vice president of Viking Press. Viking had published Ernst\u2019s  To The Pure, as well as Joyce\u2019s  Dubliners and  Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In a letter after the lunch, Ernst told Huebsch he was confident that because of his recent victories in obscenity cases,  Ulysses can \u201cnow be tested (in court) with the real hope of gaining immunity for it.\u201d Ernst assured Huebsch that he had little to lose under his plan. Because customs actions proceeded against the book, rather than its publisher or mailer, no one risked fines or jail sentences. Huebsch didn\u2019t have to spend a dime on publishing  Ulysses until the court approved it\u2014the fight would be waged over an imported copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition. Success in the customs case didn\u2019t mean that it was completely safe to publish  Ulysses, however, Ernst warned. The book could still be seized by the post office, and the publisher could be charged under state obscenity laws. The approval of  Ulysses by a federal tribunal, however, made subsequent actions against the book \u201chighly improbable,\u201d according to Ernst.\n  As an incentive to get Viking to publish Ulysses and sponsor the case, Ernst offered Huebsch his usual deal. His normal fee was a retainer of $1,000. If the case were appealed to the Supreme Court, fees and costs could run as high as $8,000. Ernst proposed a contingency arrangement in which he would be paid a retainer of $500 and an additional $500 for each subsequent appeal. The maximum would be $2,000 if the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. In exchange for the reduced rate, Ernst wanted 4 percent of the book\u2019s royalties.\n Ernst knew he had a good chance of winning the case and that the publicity around the litigation would drive up the book\u2019s sales. Huebsch agreed and approached Sylvia Beach about obtaining the American rights to Ulysses. When she demanded $25,000, Huebsch balked. Huebsch then wrote to Bennett Cerf, the young president of Random House, who had also expressed interest in publishing  Ulysses. Huebsch told Cerf that it was fine for him to try to acquire the rights from Beach. Around the same time, Robert Kastor, a New York stockbroker who was the brother-in-law of Joyce\u2019s son, approached Cerf and asked if Random House was interested in publishing  Ulysses.\n Cerf was thrilled at the possibility of issuing the first legal edition of  Ulysses. It would bring Random House, then a fledgling company (only six years old), into major prominence in the publishing world. Cerf and Ernst met in March 1932, and Ernst offered him the same contingency deal he had presented to Huebsch. Meanwhile, under pressure from Joyce, Sylvia Beach agreed to give Joyce the world rights to  Ulysses. By the end of the month, Random House had worked out a contract with Joyce in which Joyce received $1,500 and the firm obtained the US rights to the book. Ernst would litigate the customs case, and if the book were cleared, Random House would publish it. Under the final agreement with Random House, Ernst would receive 5 percent of the royalties if the book were legalized and published. Cerf \u201chad not the faintest doubt\u201d that Ernst would win the case. Ernst, he was sure, could handle the litigation \u201cbetter than anyone else in the country.\u201d\n  Ernst set the wheels of the \u201cgrandest obscenity case\u201d in motion in 1932 when he instructed Cerf to have a copy of  Ulysses sent from Paris to Random House\u2019s office in New York. Cerf wrote to Joyce\u2019s secretary Paul Leon asking him \u201cto purchase the latest edition of Ulysses.\u201d Knowing the courts\u2019 resistance to hearing expert testimony in obscenity cases, Ernst had come up with the idea of pasting positive reviews of Ulysses into the book itself, which would be introduced as evidence. Cerf advised Leon, \u201cif there has been printed . . . any circular containing opinions of prominent men or critics on this book, paste a copy of the circular into the front of the book. It is important that this circular be actually pasted into the book, as if it is separate we may not be able to use it as evidence when the trial comes up, but if these opinions of respected people are actually pasted in the book, they become, for legal purposes, a part of the book, and can be introduced as evidence.\u201d Leon was told to notify Cerf what ship the book would be coming in on so that Cerf and Lindey could alert authorities. Cerf explained, \u201cIt is necessary that they catch this book or all our efforts in this matter will have been in vain.\u201d\n  The main argument Ernst planned to make in court was by then a familiar one\u2014that the question of whether a work was obscene should be determined by contemporary social standards, and it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that the public accepted  Ulysses. Ernst planned to demonstrate this by showing the accolades the book had won from literary critics, professors, and other \u201cprominent men\u201d whose sentiments reflected public opinion. Ernst instructed Lindey to have Random House send more than five hundred letters to esteemed writers and intellectuals surveying their opinion on  Ulysses. Cerf was also told to put together a massive file containing essays, articles, and positive reviews of  Ulysses, as well as statements from \u201cprominent critics, librarians, authors, physicians, psychologists, welfare workers, and the like,\u201d attesting that  Ulysses had major \u201cliterary, scientific, [and] sociological value.\u201d Random House also sent a circular to one hundred colleges and universities, asking whether Joyce was used in courses. Nine hundred letters were sent to librarians, querying whether  Ulysses was on their shelves or whether they would like to have it in their collections. By the end of May, Random House had received favorable responses from several important literary figures, including George Jean Nathan, Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hundreds of librarians said they wanted to have copies of the book and saw  Ulysses as having major literary importance.\n On April 27, 1932, Leon telegrammed Cerf that he had shipped a copy of  Ulysses on the SS Bremen, scheduled to arrive in New York on May 3. Leon had pasted positive reviews into the book\u2019s cover; he also sent several articles praising  Ulysses that he hoped Ernst could use in his \u201cspeech before either the lower or the higher court.\u201d31 Lindey alerted the collector of customs:\n \u201cA copy of James Joyce\u2019s novel, entitled Ulysses, has been dispatched into this country, addressed to our client. We are informed that the volume left on the Bremen on April 28, and is due at the port of New York on Tuesday, May 3, 1932.\n \u201cWe are transmitting this information to you because we do not wish the book to slip through the Customs without official scrutiny. As you may know, Ulysses during the last two decades has been praised by critics as probably the most important contribution to the world literature of the twentieth century. Entirely apart from its profound literary significance, we are convinced that Ulysses is not violative of the Tariff Act. In saying this we are not unmindful of the adverse attitude of your department with regard to the book in the past. We feel, however, that in view of such recent decisions as [the Dennett, Married Love, and Contraception cases] there is no longer any legal sanction for such attitude.\u201d\n A few days later the book showed up at Random House\u2014it had passed through customs. Furious, Ernst personally marched the package over to the customs office and demanded that it be searched.

", "note_en": "Little Red Dog Games is an indie game developer that primarily uses  Godot to create games such as   Deep Sixed,   Precipice, and their latest game,   Rogue State Revolution. To learn more about their experience developing games in Linux, we sat down for an interview with CEO Ryan Hewer and Lead Programmer, Denis Comtesse.\n Tell us a little about Little Red Dog Games. How did you come into being as a company?\n Ryan: We\u2019ve been around for the better part of a decade now\u2014I\u2019d say maybe 8 years. We\u2019re based out of northern New York, and Denis resides in Germany. We started off as a hobby business making point-and-click adventure games and playing around with various tools that are out there. With every product we said, alright, well what if we take it a little bit further? What if we push ourselves a little bit more? Then we started taking on increasingly ambitious games.\n Now we\u2019ve come to the point where we\u2019re not really a hobby business anymore, we\u2019re all full-time developers. We\u2019ve got a studio that has put out four commercial games\u2014and a smattering of other things we won\u2019t admit to. I think we\u2019re one of the larger companies out there that uses the Godot open source software, and we\u2019re definitely one of the larger Linux-focused companies out there.\n   Ryan: Denis is our lead programmer, and he works within the Linux environment, so it\u2019s kind of a requirement for anything that we do. We have to play nicely with Linux.\n Denis: It\u2019s all my fault. Originally the first game was made with Adventure Game Studio, which I believe was still Windows-based, but from 2016 onward we started to use Godot. Since I\u2019ve been a Linux user since about 2008, I just used the tools that I\u2019d always used, and we just went with it.\n  Linux, and by extension Godot, are not usually the go-to game development platforms. Why did you choose to design your games in this software?\n Ryan: We\u2019re not exclusively Linux developers, and working within the Godot system doesn\u2019t come at the expense of other platforms. So for us, because we use Godot for a lot of our products, adapting from Windows to Linux is quite literally like flipping a switch, changing a few parameters here and there; but I would say it\u2019s less than a half-hour\u2019s work to be able to support Linux consumers out there. Linux users represent about 7 percent of our market right now as game developers, which is more than enough to justify the minimal steps needed to be able to make the game compatible for Linux PCs.\n Denis: For my case, I\u2019ve always been using Linux. It\u2019s just my favorite operating system. I\u2019m doing all my work in it. I\u2019m also a musician and I\u2019m recording all my music in Linux, and so for me it was just obvious since most game engines support Linux.\n On the other hand, I didn\u2019t pick Godot because it has good Linux support\u2014that\u2019s a welcome bonus\u2014but because I really like the workflow of it. I tested a couple of engines, and this was the one I preferred. And since I had already worked with Godot, it was obvious that we would continue using this engine for similar projects.\n    What do you find are the benefits of Linux game development over more traditional avenues? Why is it your preference?\n Denis: I usually encourage everyone to use the tools they like. Of course in a game development team we have to agree on certain things like which game engine we use. But other than that, some people use Linux, and some people use Windows on our team. Everyone just uses what they like to use within the limitations of the project. We\u2019re not forcing anyone to work in an operating system they don\u2019t like.\n  Denis: Most of the work is translatable unless you need certain tools that aren\u2019t available on Linux. Sometimes you have to use workarounds, but with compatibility layouts like WINE and all the possibilities that allow you to run Windows software on Linux quite easily now, I haven\u2019t run into any problems. As a Linux user for many years, I know how to approach these things. I\u2019ve mostly used open source software even before I switched to Linux, so the switch wasn\u2019t difficult for me.\n  Ryan: Right now there exists very little pressure or incentive pushing game developers, practically speaking, into developing for Linux. It\u2019s more of a spillover benefit of trying to work with new and diverse tools. Godot\u2019s market share is slowly growing within the realm of non-traditional engines. And it\u2019s inevitable that with that, with an increasing number of developers that are adopting Godot as an engine, you\u2019re going to see more Linux games coming out into the market. There\u2019s no reason not to. It would be a huge oversight for any developer to not be putting out packages for that 7 percent demographic, and it\u2019s painless within Godot to do that. I think just for that reason you\u2019re going to see more content.\n We will say that our Linux users are often very grateful for all of our products that come out in the Linux environment, and they can be some of your biggest cheerleaders. I would encourage developers to pay attention to these overlooked markets, just because that kind of publicity can go a very long way.\n Denis: The only thing that any developer has to be aware of is that as soon as you release something for Linux, you have to do support for Linux. For us it\u2019s easy. If the lead programmer is already working in Linux, then it\u2019s no problem. Every build is tested in Linux by default because I\u2019m using it every day, but for other developers it\u2019s definitely something to consider because you need someone who knows Linux and knows how it works to be able to provide support. Godot was very easy to work with in that regard, and I don\u2019t think we had any Linux-specific bug reports, have we?\n Ryan: No. Actually it\u2019s the opposite. Historically when it comes to development we always get issues in Windows, and then the response back is, well we\u2019re not seeing that on the Linux build at all. And that\u2019s nice\u2014unless you\u2019re us, in which case that\u2019s just frustrating and awful. But I would say that usually the Linux builds have fewer stability issues. I would encourage developers to generally use a mix of OSes in their pipeline really early on in development, because you can catch some real weird behavior that way before it\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve definitely caught some issues when it comes to file naming for the Linux environment, for example, and that sometimes things that would be acceptable in Windows are not acceptable in Linux and vice versa.\n   Denis: I game almost exclusively on Linux because it\u2019s getting easier. A couple of years ago, I occasionally had to use  WINE to run Linux games when I had to run Windows games on Linux, which is getting more and more reliable. It works surprisingly well, and now with Steam Play it\u2019s getting even easier. Most of the time the game just runs out of the box. It surprises me, I usually don\u2019t even check to see if a game has Linux support when I buy it, just because even if it doesn\u2019t, I can usually get it to run.\n As for favorite games, I\u2019m not playing enough, to be honest. I play strategy games and adventure games, and the most recent title that had native Linux support that I played was   Beyond a Steel Sky. I like that one.\n  Denis: I rarely play on Windows. Only in the very rare case where a game just won\u2019t run, and that hasn\u2019t happened in a while. Most stores come with their own launchers, and installing a game is just a couple of mouse clicks, so for me it\u2019s not any different.\n  Ryan: Oh, man. The things I could tell you. We\u2019ve started work on what is our largest and most ambitious project ever, and I don\u2019t like saying the word magnum opus because I say it too much, but this really does qualify. This is a big one. Our team has grown rapidly over the past year or so, and we\u2019re going to be experiencing growth for the next year or so after that. The next game will be stunningly gorgeous.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:01:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u5f00\u53d1,linux,games",

officials that it plans to open the Supercharger network to other automakers by September 2022.\n The news comes amid several rumors of Tesla opening up its extremely valuable electric vehicle fast-charging network.\n  It\u2019s hard to put a number on that value, but there\u2019s no doubt at this point that Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network is the most extensive electric vehicle fast-charging network in the world.\n Instead of relying on third-party charging networks like most other automakers, Tesla developed its own network from the ground up, which was more of a necessity, considering how early Tesla was with electric vehicles.\n A decade after deploying the first Supercharger,\u00a0 Tesla now has over 25,000 Superchargers\u00a0at over 2,700 stations around the world.\n Unlike third-party networks, like Ionity, Electrify America, or ChargePoint, only Tesla vehicles can charge on the Supercharger network.\n However, Tesla has often indicated that it is open to the idea of sharing the Supercharger network with other automakers, but it would be dependent on coming to an agreement on sharing the cost.\n The automaker has been rumored to be in discussions with other automakers to come to such a deal in the past, but we have never seen any actual results.\n   The rumors of Tesla opening up the Supercharger network have been ramping up lately. A German official recently announced that they have been in  talks with Tesla to open up the network to other automakers.\n  Tesla has been in contact with  Vestland fylkeskommune, the governing body of Vestland county in Norway, about getting access to incentives to deploy charging stations.\n  In minutes of a council meeting obtained by Electrek (hat tip to Hillmann Hunter), government officials confirmed that Tesla told them that it plans to open the Supercharger network to other automakers by September 2022, and therefore, they agree to approve the incentives as long as Tesla goest through with the initiative.\n Here\u2019s the relevant segment of the meeting (translated from Norwegian via Google Translate):\n \u201cThe condition for benefits is that infrastructure must be developed with a publicly available offer. Tesla applied for benefits to expand 5 fast-charging stations. Tesla\u2019s charging stations today are just available for Tesla cars. That type of infrastructure is then only open for use by one group and not for the general public otherwise. In the application, Tesla describes the relevant charging stations will nevertheless be publicly available from the third quarter of 2022. The administration considers that the charging stations for which benefits have been applied for will then be eligible for the scheme, provided that the benefits paid out after Tesla opens the charging offer for all car brands no later than the end of September 2022. The administration recommends that Vestland County Municipality take note that the benefit can be removed if the conditions are not met.\u201d\n For the first time, this put an actual timeline for Tesla opening its Supercharger network to other automakers.\n It\u2019s unclear if it would only be for Norway, Europe, or globally, but as previously mentioned, Tesla has recently been in similar talks in Germany.\n It would be easier for Tesla to open the network in Europe, where its Supercharger network uses the CCS connector, which is standard in the region.\n  In North America, Tesla would have to offer an adapter since it uses a proprietary plug on its vehicles and charging stations in that market.\n  This is a big deal. It\u2019s the best source of information about Tesla opening up the Supercharger network to date, and it also gives us a timeline.\n The timeline should also be reassuring to people since one of the big concerns was that opening up the Supercharger network would result in more traffic and create possibly longer wait times.\n However, with over a year to plan the move, Tesla has some time to prepare and improve capacity where needed in order to welcome more EV owners on the network.\n Obviously, this will be a new source of revenue for Tesla, which it can then pour into expanding the Supercharger network.\n But more importantly, it will enhance the charging experience for every other EV, which will help Tesla\u2019s mission to accelerate EV adoption.\n This move is making some people show their true colors. When I say I&#39;m a Tesla fan, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m a fan of the mission to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles and this is a mission move. More charging solutions for every EV is a good thing for EV adoption period.  https://t.co/sNLoWvVdXg\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.

", "note_en": "Most movie companies require viewers to invest 90 minutes or longer to absorb their theatrical works in the way they were intended but this method of presenting a story is reportedly being undermined.\n Earlier this week, the Content Overseas Distribution Association (CODA) informed TF that people are now devoting entire YouTube channels to so-called \u2018fast movies\u2019.\n These are heavily edited copies of mainstream movies that aim to tell the whole story (complete with spoilers) within a very short period, often inside just 10 minutes.\n  As this image of one example channel shows, these edits are very popular and can generate millions of views. According to CODA, there are channels with hundreds of uploads being viewed tens of millions of times, often with a for-profit motive. This means that they may fall outside traditional \u2018 fair use\u2018 style exceptions.\n  During our discussions with CODA our impression was that \u2018fast movie\u2019 uploaders would be dealt with sometime in the future but a few hours ago the anti-piracy group informed us that police in Japan had already sprung into action.\n During Wednesday, the Miyagi Prefectural Police Life Safety Division and the Shiogama Police Station arrested three suspects under suspicion of uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube without the rightsholders\u2019 consent. The arrests were reportedly carried out under the Copyright Act, which was boosted with  new amendments on January 1, 2021.\n \u201cFrom June to July 2020, the suspects edited \u2018I Am a Hero\u2019 and two other motion pictures owned by Toho Co., Ltd. as well as \u2018Cold Fish\u2019 and one other motion picture owned by Nikkatsu Corporation down to about 10 minutes without the permission of the right holders. Further, the suspects added narration and uploaded the videos to YouTube to earn advertising revenue,\u201d CODA explains.\n  \u201cFast movies are clear copyright infringement and serious crime that goes beyond the scope of legally permitted citation, however minor each act may seem,\u201d CODA informs TorrentFreak.\n \u201cFast movies including spoilers would discourage viewers from watching the original films and thus have a serious adverse effect on the right holders.\u201d\n In addition to uploaders who do not seek to gain financially, CODA says that some are effectively commercial operations, working at scale to utilize existing copyrighted movies in order to generate profit.\n \u201cThere are also malicious contributors who make a profit from advertising revenue, such as uploading 270 works and channels that are played about 80 million times in total. In addition, the content including spoilers leads to not watching the official main movie, and the influence on the right holder is enormous.\u201d\n An earlier report from  NHK indicates that the losses cited by rightsholders are huge \u2013 95 billion yen (US$ 856.7m) in the past 12 months alone, roughly $10 per \u2018fast movie\u2019 view when working in the 80 million views cited by CODA.\n  Copyright laws in the United States (where YouTube is based) differ from those in Japan, so it is not yet clear what type of action will be taken overseas. According to CODA, however, the rightsholders it represents are \u201cseriously concerned\u201d with the rise of \u2018fast movies\u2019 and although specifics cannot be provided at the moment, CODA will play a prominent role in any action taken.\n \u201cCODA shall co-operate with international enforcement partners to identify malicious account operators and consult with the police for successful criminal prosecution to wipe out \u2018fast movies\u2019,\u201d the anti-piracy group says.\n In respect of civil action, CODA says it is yet to apply for DMCA subpoenas in US courts to identify people uploading \u2018fast movies\u2019 to YouTube but it will be assisting rightsholders when that takes place, or when lawsuits are filed.\n  CODA informs TF that some channels have already begun removing their \u2018fast movies\u2019. Indeed, CODA sent us a number of links to channels that were accused of infringing the rights of MPA members studios (including Disney) but just a few hours later, these channels had disappeared from YouTube ( 1, 2).\n All of the channels shared by CODA appear to be operated from Japan but there is no shortage of YouTube channels operated from the US too.\n CODA doesn\u2019t name any of these as specific problems but they are undoubtedly popular with movie fans. Well put together, with commentary describing the films in some detail, some appear to have been in operation for years while also managing to evade YouTube\u2019s Content ID system.\n It will remain to be seen what legal remedies the studios have available to them outside Japan but in the meantime, CODA is encouraging movie fans not to visit \u2018fast movie\u2019 channels at all.\n \u201cCODA urges viewers to remember that viewing illicit videos would benefit the criminals indirectly and damage the interests of the right holders who create the original works,\u201d the anti-piracy group concludes.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:00:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u7535\u5f71,\u53d1\u5e03,\u8b66\u65b9,arrest", "title": "\u8b66\u65b9\u902e\u6355\u4e86\u4e09\u6b21\u5728YouTube\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e0310\u5206\u949f\u7535\u5f71\u6458\u8981 ", "title_en": "Police Arrest Three for Posting 10 Minute Movie Summaries on YouTube", "transed": 1, "url": "https://torrentfreak.com/police-arrest-three-for-posting-10-minute-movie-summaries-on-youtube-210623/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u7535\u5f71", "\u53d1\u5e03", "\u8b66\u65b9", "arrest"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068061, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u632a\u5a01\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u521a\u521a\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u68a6\u5e7b\u822c\u7684\u65b0\u62a5\u544a\uff1a\u201c\u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u65f6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u201d\u4ece\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a\n \u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ae0\u8282\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u5a92\u4f53\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8db3\u591f\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u7981\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5229\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n \u7981\u6b62\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u5e94\u91c7\u53d6\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u73b0\u884c\u7acb\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u822c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u76d1\u7ba1\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u76d1\u7ba1\u548c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u60ef\u4f8b\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6267\u6cd5\u76ee\u524d\u6d88\u8017\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u635f\u574f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5c06\u5f3a\u8feb\u5bf9\u5e7f\u544a\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u5927\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u91cd\u5927\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\n \u7981\u6b62\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0d\u518d\u878d\u8d44\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5e7f\u544a\u6280\u672f\u3002 ", "note_en": "The Norwegian Consumer Council just published a fantastic new report: \u201c Time to Ban Surveillance-Based Advertising.\u201d From the Introduction:\n In the following chapters, we describe various aspects of these challenges and point out how today\u2019s dominant model of online advertising is a threat to consumers, democratic societies, the media, and even to advertisers themselves. These issues are significant and serious enough that we believe that it is time to ban these detrimental practices.\n A ban on surveillance-based practices should be complemented by stronger enforcement of existing legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation, competition regulation, and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. However, enforcement currently consumes significant time and resources, and usually happens after the damage has already been done. Banning surveillance-based advertising in general will force structural changes to the advertising industry and alleviate a number of significant harms to consumers and to society at large.\n A ban on surveillance-based advertising does not mean that one can no longer finance digital content using advertising. To illustrate this, we describe some possible ways forward for advertising-funded digital content, and point to alternative advertising technologies that may contribute to a safer and healthier digital economy for both consumers and businesses.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:59:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5e7f\u544a,\u76d1\u89c6,surveillance,\u6d88\u8d39\u8005", "title": "\u7981\u6b62\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u5e7f\u544a ", "title_en": "Banning Surveillance-Based Advertising", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/06/banning-surveillance-based-advertising.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e7f\u544a", "\u76d1\u89c6", "\u6d88\u8d39\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8f94fcff8cc451f1e6af986acee561ea.jpg", "infoid": 1068059, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u610f\u89c1\uff1a\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5e38\u8010\u7528\u7684\u65bd\u5de5\u6750\u6599\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u672a\u6210\u65e5\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u5706\u9876\u7f57\u9a6c\u7684\u5b8f\u4f1f\u4e07\u795e\u6bbf\uff0c\u5728\u8fd11,900\u5e74\u540e\u5904\u4e8e\u51fa\u8272\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u4e0a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784 -

The magnificent\u00a0 Pantheon\u00a0in Rome, the world\u2019s largest unreinforced concrete dome, is in excellent condition after nearly 1,900 years. And yet many concrete structures from last century \u2013 bridges, highways and buildings \u2013 are crumbling. Many concrete structures built this century will be obsolete before its end.\n Given the survival of ancient structures, this may seem curious. The critical difference is the modern use of steel reinforcement, known as\u00a0 rebar, concealed within the concrete. Steel is made mainly of iron, and one of iron\u2019s unalterable properties is that it rusts. This ruins the durability of concrete structures in ways that are difficult to detect and costly to repair.\n While repair may be justified to preserve the architectural legacy of iconic 20th-century buildings, such as those designed by\u00a0 reinforced concrete users like Frank Lloyd Wright, it is questionable whether this will be affordable or desirable for the vast majority of structures. The writer Robert Courland, in his book\u00a0 Concrete Planet, estimates that repair and rebuilding costs of concrete infrastructure, just in the United States, will be in the trillions of dollars \u2013 to be paid by future generations.\n   Steel reinforcement was a dramatic innovation of the 19th century. The steel bars add strength, allowing the creation of long, cantilevered structures and thinner, less-supported slabs. It speeds up construction times, because less concrete is required to pour such slabs.\n These qualities, pushed by\u00a0 assertive and sometimes duplicitous promotion by the concrete industry\u00a0in the early 20th century, led to its massive popularity.\n Reinforced concrete competes against more durable building technologies, like steel frame or traditional bricks and mortar. Around the world, it has replaced environmentally sensitive, low-carbon options like mud brick and\u00a0 rammed earth\u00a0\u2013 historical practices that may also be more durable.\n Early 20th-century engineers thought reinforced concrete structures would last a very long time \u2013 perhaps 1,000 years. In reality, their life span is more like 50-100 years, and sometimes less. Building codes and policies generally require buildings to survive for several decades, but deterioration can begin in\u00a0 as little as 10 years.\n Many engineers and architects point to the natural affinities between steel and concrete: they have similar thermal expansion characteristics, and concrete\u2019s alkalinity can help to inhibit rust. But there is still a lack of knowledge about their composite qualities \u2013 for example, in regard to\u00a0 sun-exposure-related changes in temperature.\n The many alternative materials for concrete reinforcement \u2013 such as stainless steel, aluminium bronze and fibre-polymer composites \u2013 are not yet widely used. The affordability of plain steel reinforcement is attractive to developers. But many planners and developers fail to consider the\u00a0 extended costs of maintenance, repair or replacement.\n   There are technologies that can address the problem of steel corrosion, such as\u00a0 cathodic protection, in which the entire structure is connected to a rust-inhibiting electric current. There are also interesting new methods to monitor corrosion, by\u00a0 electrical\u00a0or\u00a0 acousticmeans.\n Another option is to treat the concrete with a rust-inhibiting compound, although these can be toxic and inappropriate for buildings. There are several new non-toxic inhibitors, including\u00a0 compounds extracted from bamboo\u00a0and\u00a0 bacterially derived \u201cbiomolecules\u201d.\n Fundamentally, however, none of these developments can resolve the inherent problem that putting steel inside concrete ruins its potentially great durability.\n  This has serious repercussions for the planet. Concrete is the third-largest contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, after automobiles and coal-fuelled power plants. Cement manufacturing alone is responsible for\u00a0 roughly 5% of global CO\u2082 emissions. Concrete also makes up the largest proportion of construction and demolition waste, and represents about a third of all landfill waste.\n Recycling concrete is\u00a0 difficult and expensive,\u00a0 reduces its strength\u00a0and may catalyse chemical reactions that speed up decay. The world needs to reduce its concrete production, but this will not be possible without building longer-lasting structures.\n   In a recent paper, I suggest that the widespread acceptance of reinforced concrete may be the expression of a traditional, dominant and ultimately destructive view of matter as inert. But reinforced concrete is not really inert.\n Concrete is commonly perceived as a stone-like, monolithic and homogeneous material. In fact, it is a complex mix of cooked limestone, clay-like materials and a wide variety of rock or sandy aggregates. Limestone itself is a sedimentary rock composed of shells and coral, whose formation is influenced by many biological, geological and climatological factors.\n This means that concrete structures, for all their stone-like superficial qualities, are actually made of the skeletons of sea creatures ground up with rock. It takes millions upon millions of years for these sea creatures to live, die and form into limestone. This timescale contrasts starkly with the life spans of contemporary buildings.\n Steel is often perceived to be inert and resilient too. Terms such as \u201cIron Age\u201d suggest an ancient durability, although Iron Age artefacts are comparatively rare precisely because they rust. If construction steel is visible, it can be maintained \u2013 for instance, when the Sydney Harbour Bridge is\u00a0 repeatedly painted and repainted.\n However, when embedded in concrete, steel is hidden but secretly active. Moisture entering through thousands of tiny cracks creates an electrochemical reaction. One end of the rebar becomes an anode and the other a cathode, forming a \u201cbattery\u201d that powers the transformation of iron into rust. Rust can expand the rebar up to four times its size, enlarging cracks and forcing the concrete to fracture apart in a process called\u00a0 spalling, more widely known as \u201cconcrete cancer\u201d.\n    I suggest that we need to change our thinking, to recognise concrete and steel as\u00a0 vibrant and active materials. This is not a case of changing any facts, but rather of re-orientating how we understand and act on those facts. Avoiding waste, pollution and needless rebuilding will require\u00a0 thinking well beyond disciplinary conceptions of time, and this is especially true for the building and construction industries.\n The collapsed civilisations of the past show us the consequences of short-term thinking. We should focus on building structures that stand the test of time \u2013 lest we end up with hulking, derelict artefacts that are no more fit for their original purpose than the statues of\u00a0 Easter Island.\n Guy Keulemans is an associate lecturer, Art &amp; Design Research,\u00a0UNSW.

evidence that a coronavirus epidemic swept East Asia some 20,000 years ago and was devastating enough to leave an evolutionary imprint on the DNA of people alive today.\n  The new  study suggests that an ancient coronavirus plagued the region for many years, researchers say. The finding could have dire implications for the Covid-19 pandemic if it\u2019s not brought under control soon through vaccination.\n \u201cIt should make us worry,\u201d said David Enard, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who led the study, which was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cWhat is going on right now might be going on for generations and generations.\u201d\n Until now, researchers could not look back very far into the history of this family of pathogens. Over the past 20 years, three coronaviruses have adapted to infect humans and cause severe respiratory disease: Covid-19, SARS and MERS. Studies on each of these coronaviruses indicate that they jumped into our species from bats or other mammals.\n Four other coronaviruses can also infect people, but they usually cause only mild colds. Scientists did not directly observe these coronaviruses becoming human pathogens, so they have relied on indirect clues to estimate when the jumps happened. Coronaviruses gain new mutations at a roughly regular rate, and so comparing their genetic variation makes it possible to determine  when they diverged from a common ancestor.\n The most recent of these mild coronaviruses, called HCoV-HKU1, crossed the species barrier in the 1950s. The oldest, called HCoV-NL63, may date back as far as 820 years.\n But before that point, the coronavirus trail went cold \u2014 until Dr. Enard and his colleagues applied a new method to the search. Instead of looking at the genes of the coronaviruses, the researchers looked at the effects on the DNA of their human hosts.\n Over generations, viruses drive enormous amounts of change in the human genome. A mutation that protects against a viral infection may well mean the difference between life and death, and it will be passed down to offspring. A lifesaving mutation, for example, might allow people to chop apart a virus\u2019s proteins.\n But viruses can evolve, too. Their proteins can change shape to overcome a host\u2019s defenses. And those changes might spur the host to evolve even more counteroffensives, leading to more mutations.\n When a random new mutation happens to provide resistance to a virus, it can swiftly become more common from one generation to the next. And other versions of that gene, in turn, become rarer. So if one version of a gene dominates all others in large groups of people, scientists know that is most likely a signature of rapid evolution in the past.\n In  recent years, Dr. Enard and his colleagues have searched the human genome for these patterns of genetic variation in order to reconstruct the history of an array of viruses. When the pandemic struck, he wondered whether ancient coronaviruses had left a distinctive mark of their own.\n He and his colleagues compared the DNA of thousands of people across 26 different populations around the world, looking at a combination of genes  known to be crucial for coronaviruses but not other kinds of pathogens. In East Asian populations, the scientists found that 42 of these genes had a dominant version. That was a strong signal that people in East Asia had adapted to an ancient coronavirus.\n But whatever happened in East Asia seemed to have been limited to that region. \u201cWhen we compared them to populations around the world, we couldn\u2019t find the signal,\u201d said Yassine Souilmi, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Adelaide in Australia and a co-author of the new study.\n The scientists then tried to estimate how long ago East Asians had adapted to a coronavirus. They took advantage of the fact that once a dominant version of a gene starts being passed down through the generations, it can gain harmless random mutations. As more time passes, more of those mutations accumulate.\n Dr. Enard and his colleagues found that the 42 genes all had about the same number of mutations. That meant that they had all rapidly evolved at about the same time. \u201cThis is a signal we should absolutely not expect by chance,\u201d Dr. Enard said.\n They estimated that all of those genes evolved their antiviral mutations sometime between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago, most likely over the course of a few centuries. It\u2019s a surprising finding, since East Asians at the time were not living in dense communities but instead formed small bands of hunter-gatherers.\n Aida Andres, an evolutionary geneticist at the University College London who was not involved in the new study, said she found the work compelling. \u201cI\u2019m quite convinced there\u2019s something there,\u201d she said.\n Still, she didn\u2019t think it was possible yet to make a firm estimate of how long ago the ancient epidemic took place. \u201cThe timing is a complicated thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that happened a few thousand years before or after \u2014 I personally think it\u2019s something that we cannot be as confident of.\u201d\n Scientists looking for drugs to fight the new coronavirus might want to scrutinize the 42 genes that evolved in response to the ancient epidemic, Dr. Souilmi said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually pointing us to molecular knobs to adjust the immune response to the virus,\u201d he said.\n Dr. Anders agreed, saying that the genes identified in the new study should get special attention as targets for drugs. \u201cYou know that they\u2019re important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the nice thing about evolution.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:58:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "The financing values New York-based SmartAsset at over $1 billion, and brings its total raised since its 2012 inception to just over $161 million, according to  Crunchbase.\n TTV Capital led SmartAsset\u2019s Series D, which also included participation from Javelin Venture Partners, Contour Venture Partners, Citi Ventures, New York Life Ventures, North Bridge Venture Partners and CMFG Ventures.\n  The company last raised in June of 2018 \u2013 a $28 million Series C led by Focus Financial Partners. Since then, it says it has grown revenue \u201cby 10 times\u201d and is now on the cusp of reaching $100 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue). It recently made its one millionth consumer/advisor match on its  SmartAdvisor platform. Also in 2020, SmartAsset says it referred $10 billion in new, closed assets under management (AUM) to financial advisors and firms across the U.S.\n  Besides pairing consumers with advisors with its Automated Financial Modeling software, SmartAsset claims to reach over 100 million people each month through its personal finance content, tools and \u201cpersonalized\u201d calculators.\n Prior to starting the company, Carvin worked in finance. In  an interview with Y Combinator (one of its backers), he shared how his frustration in finding information about buying a home and getting a mortgage \u201cthat was useful, accurate and unbiased\u201d led him to join forces with Philip Camilleri to found SmartAsset.\n \u201cCalculators had obvious errors and the content seemed like it was all written by people that wanted me to take out the largest mortgage possible,\u201d he added. So the pair launched SmartAsset in an effort to provide people with the tools and content to help them make better decisions around topics such as retirement, taxes, savings, homeownership and insurance.\n The company plans to use the new capital to invest in new product offerings, technology infrastructure and data partnerships. It also plans to boost its current headcount of 202 by more than 75% this year.\n TTV Capital Partner Mark Johnson said the company \u201cis quickly expanding its lead in one of the largest markets in the U.S. by providing an incredibly valuable resource for both consumers and financial advisors alike.\u201d\n The funding and its flashy valuation comes with a certain weight, even in the growing world of unicorn companies.\n The company  claims that, with today\u2019s news, co-founder Michael Carvin now becomes the fourth Black founder and CEO of a company valued at over $1 billion. Others include Compass CEO and founder Robert Reffkin, whom we recently profiled  here, and Calendly CEO and founder Tope Awotona,  who we have also profiled.\n While exciting, the unfortunate rarity of Black-led unicorns is a symptom of historical underfunding in Black or African-American startup founders. Crunchbase estimates that in 2020, 1% of total venture capital funding, or $1 billion, went to this cohort of founders.\n A number of Black-led venture capital firms have closed investments in the past year, which could change this number, including  Collab Capital\u2019s $50 million investment vehicle,\u00a0Harlem Capital, which  closed a $134 million seed fund\u00a0earlier this year; Cleo Capital, which set a \u00a0$20 million target for Fund II; and MaC VC, which\u00a0 landed $103 million for its inaugural fund.\n HBCUvc and Google for Startups also announced this month two separate efforts to provide non-dilutive capital to early-stage, underrepresented founders.\n With a Series D under its belt, SmartAsset is working on taking out the bias from personal finance \u2013 while it itself is a case study in how overlooked founders, which routinely suffer from this exact phenomenon, continue to lead strong businesses.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:17:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651,rethinks,\u521b\u59cb\u4eba", "title": "SmartAsset\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u8d22\u52a1\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSmartAsset rethinks financial advisory, and becomes a unicorn in the process\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/smartasset-rethinks-financial-advisory-and-becomes-a-unicorn-in-the-process/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651", "rethinks", "\u521b\u59cb\u4eba"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eedf90c9de95b1434cbad316be4df517.jpg", "infoid": 1068055, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u5c06\u4e0e\u4e00\u5bb6\u516c\u5171\u516c\u53f8890 Fifth Avenue Partners Inc.\u7684Buzzfeed\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5408\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f53\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f30\u4ef7\u7ea6\u4e3a15\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n BuzzFeed\u7684Spac\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u8be5\u8868\u5e26\u67652.88\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\uff0c\u800cBuzzfeed\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u53ef\u8f6c\u6362\u503a\u52a1\u4e2d\u7b79\u96c6\u53e6\u59161.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u5728\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u5b57\u4e2d\uff0cBuzzfeed\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5927\u7ea6\u6570\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5927\u81f4\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u751a\u81f3\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4ecb\u7ecd\u9884\u8ba1\u57282020\u5e74\u6700\u5e73\u5766\u76842020\u5e74\u540e\u6062\u590d\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u76c8\u5229\u3002\n \u6240\u4ee5\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u6f14\u793a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5386\u53f2\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9884\u671f\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u516c\u53f8\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u5176\u65b0\u95fb\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8d70\u5427\uff01\n \u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u5411\u524d\u6e9c\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u7279\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u514d\u8d39\uff01\n  \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48Buzzfeed\u8d2d\u4e70\u7efc\u5408\u4f53\uff1f\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5b83\u4e3a\u5176\u5e73\u53f0\u589e\u6dfb\u4e86\u89c2\u4f17\u91cf\u8868\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u9884\u671f\u672a\u6765\u5e7f\u544a\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff08\u7247\u523b\u5185\uff09\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6536\u5165\u5230\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u9876\u7ebf\u56fe\u7247\u3002\n   \u4f46\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e1a\u7ee9\u5305\u62ec\u590d\u6742\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u5386\u53f2\u6536\u5165\uff08\u7070\u8272\uff09\u548c\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\uff08\u9ed1\u8272\uff09\u7684\u7ec6\u5206\u3002\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u662f\u5176\u5c3e\u968f\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684Buzzfeed\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a \n\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5d29\u6e83\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230Buzzfeed\u9884\u8ba12021\u5e74\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u7684\u589e\u957f19\uff05\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57282022\u5e74\u6536\u8d2d\u7684\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u589e\u957f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8623\uff05\u3002  \u4ee5\u540e\u7684\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\uff0cBuzzfeed\u4e8e2019\u5e74\u589e\u957f4\uff05\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5386\u53f2\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b57\u3002 \u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u5b57\u57282020\u5e74\u8dcc\u81f3-1\uff05\u3002  \u6211\u4eec\u9605\u8bfb\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u662f\u5b83\u5728\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0b\u98ce\u5316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u8361\u76842020;

The company\u2019s investor presentation anticipates a return to growth after a mostly flat 2020, and rising profitability over time.\n So let\u2019s get into the  company\u2019s investor presentation. We want to know about its historical growth, anticipated growth, revenue mix and profitability, as well as how the company thinks about its news division. Let\u2019s go!\n I\u2019ve broken each of our points into its own mini-section, so if you want to skate ahead to any particular point, feel free!\n  Why is BuzzFeed buying Complex? In part, because it adds audience scale to its platform, a key to the company\u2019s expected future advertising revenue growth (more on that in a moment). But also because Complex adds a lot of revenue to its overall top-line picture.\n   But the company\u2019s historical results are  inclusive of Complex. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the company\u2019s historical revenues (gray) and Complex\u2019s own (black). The combined figures are what BuzzFeed notes in its trailing metrics:\n  From this breakdown, we can see that BuzzFeed anticipates 19% growth from Complex in 2021, and just under 23% growth from the group it\u2019s acquiring in 2022.\n Per a later slide, BuzzFeed grew 4% in 2019, inclusive of historical Complex numbers. That figure fell to -1% in 2020.\n Our read of the company\u2019s historical revenue growth is that it weathered a turbulent 2020 in reasonable health; digital advertising took a huge hit in the first half of the year, likely impacting BuzzFeed\u2019s operating results. To see it manage an essentially flat revenue result last year feels pretty OK.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "buzzfeed", "title": "\u6765\u81eaBuzzfeed\u7684Spac\u7532\u677f\u76845\u4e2a\u5916\u5356 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t5 takeaways from BuzzFeed\u2019s SPAC deck\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/5-takeaways-from-buzzfeeds-spac-deck/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["buzzfeed"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9bb95a35c9a318700985e60e0dee439a.jpg", "infoid": 1068054, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u5728\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5077\u5077\u6478\u6478\u540e\uff0cInstagram\u6084\u6084\u5730\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u684c\u9762\u7f51\u7ad9\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u5e16\u5b50\u7684\u9009\u9879\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u662f\u5728iPad\u4e0a\uff09\u3002\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7167\u7247\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n  \u7531Matt Navarra\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8eInstagram\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e5f\u57289To5Mac\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u91cc\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u4e48\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u73b0\u5728\u63a8\u51faMac\u548cPC\u3002\n \u5982\u679c\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u4f9b\u60a8\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u767b\u5f55\u540e\uff0c\u5728Instagram\u4e3b\u9875\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u5c4f\u5e55\u9876\u90e8\u7684\u65b0\u5f39\u51fa\u8b66\u62a5\uff0c\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u73b0\u5728\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u5e16\u5b50\u3002\u201d\n   \u51e0\u4e4e\u70ed\u95f9\u5730\uff0cInstagram\u7ee7\u7eed\u5ffd\u7565iPad\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf7\u6c42Instagram\u7684\u684c\u9762\u7ad9\u70b9\u5728Safari\u4e2d\u8bbf\u95eeiPad\u4e0a\u7684\u65b0\u684c\u9762\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u73b0\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n  \u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  - \u5728\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u7684\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u5730\u6253\u7834\u82f9\u679c\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u8bf7\u52a1\u5fc5\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u9875\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728Twitter\uff0cFacebook\u548cLinkedIn\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce89to5Mac\u4ee5\u7559\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\uff1f\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u72ec\u5bb6\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0cHow-TO\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684YouTube\u9891\u9053 ", "note_en": "After we got a  sneak peek at the feature last month, Instagram has quietly rolled out the option to create and publish posts from its website on desktop (but not on iPad).

It\u2019s unclear how widely available the new feature is but it is rolling out now for Mac and PC.\n If the feature is available for you, you\u2019ll see a new pop-up alert at the top of your screen on the Instagram homepage after logging in that says: \u201cNow you can create and share posts directly from your computer.\u201d\n   Almost hilariously, Instagram continues to ignore iPad.

\u6210\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5458 ", "note_en": "Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our  AI survey to find out.\n Google today announced it has extended its Open Source Vulnerabilities ( OSV) database to incorporate data from additional open source projects, using a unified schema for \u201cdescribing vulnerabilities precisely.\u201d\n The benefits of  open source software are  widely understood, but concerns around vulnerabilities frequently rear their head. The  vast majority of codebases contain at least one known open source vulnerability, while a report this week concluded  that more often that not, developers don\u2019t update third-party libraries after including them in their software. That same report noted that 92% of open source library flaws could be easily fixed with a simple update.\n  Open source software impacts pretty much everyone, everywhere. From small startups to major enterprises, companies rely on community-driven components in most of their applications. So it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to ensure that open source software is properly maintained.\n  In February, Google  launched the Open Source Vulnerabilities database, which it called its \u201cfirst step toward improving vulnerability triage\u201d for developers and other open source consumers. Vulnerability triage is the process of assessing and ranking known flaws in software components in order of the risk they pose to an application that uses it.\n The OSV serves data on where a vulnerability first emerged and where it got fixed so developers can better understand how they are impacted. At launch, the OSV included data from \u201c fuzzing\u201d (a technique to find software programming errors) vulnerabilities gleaned from the  Google-led OSS-Fuzz service, which integrates with  hundreds of open source projects.\n Today Google is extending OSV to include vulnerability databases from major open source projects, including  Python,  Rust,  Go, and  DWF.\n One of the major challenges of aggregating data from multiple open source databases is that they often adhere to different formats, often created uniquely by an individual organization. This distributed model makes it more difficult to unify and describe vulnerabilities in a common vernacular. Thus Google, in conjunction with the wider open source community, has been working on a \u201cvulnerability interchange schema\u201d to describe vulnerabilities across open source projects in a format that can be used by both humans and automation tools.\n Given that collaboration is the core tenet of open source software, expanding the OSV to include other open source ecosystems required active participation from all maintainers involved.\n \u201cTheir feedback helped to iterate, improve, and generalize the format,\u201d Google software engineer Oliver Chang told VentureBeat. \u201cAfter the format was in a stable state, they made some changes in their existing vulnerability datasets to match the OSV schema format. This allowed aggregation of their datasets in the OSV service, which anyone could use to query for vulnerabilities in their open source dependencies.\u201d\n  Google has seemingly doubled down on its open source security investments of late. Last week  it proposed a new \u201cend-to-end framework for supply chain integrity\u201d called Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA), which designates security certification levels to different software packages. The internet giant was also a founding member of  a new Linux Foundation project called Sigstore, which is setting out to help software developers confirm the origin and authenticity of software. And in February, Google  revealed it would underwrite the salaries of two Linux Kernel developers to help improve security.\n With Google awaiting further feedback from the open source community, the new  vulnerability schema specification is not yet finalized. However, OSS-Fuzz, Python, Rust, Go, and DWF are all now exporting this format, and the OSV has combined these  vulnerability databases into a public portal that can also be queried using a single command  via the existing APIs.\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

It will be called the Microsoft Store, not the Windows Store, just like it has been  since a rebranding in 2017.\n Here are some of the very first images of the new store.  While Windows 11 was thoroughly leaked in mid-June, that leak notably did  not include any glimpse of an updated app store, so I figure you\u2019re eager to see how it might look!\n         The new store\u2019s got a few partners on board: Adobe will offer its Creative Cloud suite, and Zoom and Disney Plus will be there. Microsoft will contribute its own Visual Studio and name-dropped Microsoft Teams, Notepad and Paint for the store, which does seem a little odd as the latter two have long been pre-installed apps, and the company  just announced  Teams will be directly integrated into Windows.\n In a major move, Microsoft\u2019s Panos Panay says developers will now be able to keep 100 percent of their revenue \u201cif you do bring your own commerce engine\u201d \u2014 unlike app stores from Apple and Google that generally take 30 percent of developer revenue and insist on their own payment platforms and in-app purchases. We\u2019ll have to see if that applies to games as well, which Microsoft and other companies have generally treated separately from apps. If you do use Microsoft\u2019s payment platform, the company confirms the revenue shares are 85/15 and 88/12 for apps and games respectively.\n Another huge surprise: the new Microsoft Store  will also include Android apps that can run on your Windows 11 PC, thanks to a partnership with Amazon and some \u201cIntel Bridge\u201d technology. The Amazon Appstore will live inside the Microsoft Store, and you\u2019ll be able to drag and pin those apps side by side traditional Windows apps on your computer.\n     In a blog post, Microsoft introduces a couple other new features: if a website wants you to install a Windows app, it can automatically pop up the Microsoft Store to handle that install. Microsoft will also have curated \u201cstories\u201d about new apps to highlight those it deems worthy.\n   We\u2019ve known since April that Microsoft might have been planning to overhaul its Windows app store this year, and as usual, the devil\u2019s in the details: will it actually be open to all apps and give developers what they want and need? The company\u2019s  been haunted by its original vision of a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) ever since Windows 8, when it architected the store explicitly to house that new breed of cross-platform app instead of the legacy Win32 programs that developers and many users tended to prefer.\n Today, Panay said whether you\u2019re developing a UWP or traditional Windows app, the Microsoft Store is designed to house them all. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) to bring their apps regardless of whether they\u2019re built as a Win32, Progressive Web App (PWA), or Universal Windows App (UWP) or any other app framework, creating an opportunity to reach and engage with more people,\u201d he writes,  in a new blog post.\n It also tried renaming the Windows Store to the Microsoft Store, which wasn\u2019t at all confusing\n The company had already buried the UWP dream in 2019 with the news that  it would accept native Win32 games in its store, and it\u2019s tried many other tactics to attract developers over the years \u2014 including revised policies that allow app developers to  keep 95 percent of app revenue, and more recently,  88 percent of revenue from their games. It\u2019s also tried to  decouple APIs so Win32 apps can take advantage of modern Windows features.\n But at the end of the day, Microsoft\u2019s app store has never made a truly convincing case for itself \u2014 to the point that the simple package manager Microsoft introduced last May  felt like a breath of fresh air.

I was a college student attending a 24-hour hackathon where we had had to build something on top of live trucking data. We were given an API that sent GPS and other metadata for 100 trucks roaming across Europe, the data updating every five seconds.\n I entered the competition with friends, and we built some basic visualization in those 24 hours. It was passable, but not something I was too proud of.\n The event was won by my brother and his two friends, who also competed at the hackathon. They built a visualization of the trucks moving on top of Google Earth and Bing Maps in a way that you could switch between maps and various visualizations. This was mind-blowing stuff back in the day, as there was no public API to build any of this. They used an undocumented API that would fetch parts of the map and built their business logic on top of this custom-made engine.\n &#34;How did you manage to use both maps and do this so fast?&#34; - I asked him. I toyed with the idea of creating something similar but quickly gave up after I saw there were no APIs to do so.\n &#34;Oh, we did a similar kind of work a few months before for a contract. The client never paid, even though I spent a week understanding the APIs, finding workarounds, and building the prototype engine. I was really upset at the time, but I&#39;m glad this work paid off as an investment - even if a different one than I imagined.&#34;\n Could work that seems like &#34;sunk costs&#34; on the short-term really be an investment for the long-term? This example certainly proved it.\n This was the first time it dawned on me that there&#39;s more to work than getting immediate rewards - on top of being paid or rewarded on the spot, you can create longer term investments.\n Ever since this example, I&#39;ve started to challenge my thinking of &#34;sunk costs&#34; in cases where my &#34;sunk&#34; efforts can help in the long-term, even if it&#39;s a failure in the short-term.\n  Software engineering interviews are a great example of the investment mindset where in the short term, you can see them as sunk costs, but in the long term, they are investments.\n I&#39;ve heard countless people complain about how it&#39;s not worth putting time in preparing for   coding or systems design interviews  as it&#39;s a sunk cost. How  even if you spend weeks or months on this, you might still get rejected by the one company you applied to.\n But thinking of interview preparation as an investment: was it worth spending weeks or months to master a  specific set of interviews? After all, engineering interviews at similar types of companies are similar enough. If you prepare for the Facebook software engineering interview -  similar to how I did in 2015 - , even if you fail at it, that same preparation is an investment in your interviewing skills for other companies.\n Treating interview preparation as an &#34;investment&#34; over a &#34;sunk cost&#34; greatly helped my career. When I moved to the UK, I spent months preparing for Google-like interviews, in 2009, using the Stanford course  Solving for the CS interview as preparation resources.\n Most of the companies did not ask me to solve algorthmic challenges - except for one company, where I ended up getting and accepting an offer. I only learned in hindsight that this was one of the most difficult companies to get into in Edinburgh. I only succeeded because I invested my time upfront.\n My story of getting into Uber is a similar one: I am convinced I able to pass the interviews as well as I did because I invested months a year earlier to prepare for the Facebook interview. I wrote about my Facebook preparation in detail  in this series of emails.\n  I started to think about my activities as investments instead of a means to an end, and my approach changed. I started to ask myself, &#34;what can I learn from this activity, even if the outcome is not what I expect?&#34;. Questions that helped me decide whether or not to pursue an activity included:\n What experience would I gain from this project, even if I get paid less than my normal rate - and thus, I&#39;m investing some money to do the project?\n What skills would I build on this team, even if changing teams mean I definitely won&#39;t be promoted the next year? This means I&#39;m investing my time in this team - and possibly some money (with a promotion I could have otherwise gotten).\n What other people would I connect with by helping organize this conference, even if the organizers are unpaid? I&#39;m investing my time in this effort.\n What new ideas might I get from writing this article, even if no one reads it and I&#39;ve invested my time?\n What learnings would I get from my mobile/web app, even if I had very few users and I&#39;ve invested my time? How much more experience would I gain if I invested my money and made it free - trading money for more users?\n Using this &#34;investment mindset&#34;, you can justify &#34;loss-making&#34; activities that many people would dismiss because they don&#39;t have obvious returns. Working on open-source projects. Writing your blog. Volunteering to help organize a conference. Releasing a quality app, service, or book for free - and many others.\n  There is a lot of career advice that has not resonated with me, from discouraging people from doing free work to maximizing your income (salary, side projects). But there&#39;s a principle that I have been following, subconsciously, that has served me well. It&#39;s this:\n Don&#39;t be afraid to invest upfront. Invest in ways you cannot make a loss. Invest your time like you would your money.\n A software professional&#39;s career can easily  last forty years, and there are a wealth of small and large investment opportunities you can make.\n These are opportunities that most people associate with &#34;free work,&#34; &#34;not worth my time,&#34; or &#34;worthless distraction.&#34; However, for certain people, they are investments with little downside but major upsides.\n  Have I done this before? If not, can I learn something if I do it?\n   Is this something most people like me would say no to? If the answer is yes, I often push myself to consider it a bit more and come up with good reasons why not do it. There&#39;s a very real herd mentality among large groups of people, and going against the &#34;crowd wisdom&#34; is an underrated way to gain novel insights.\n Can I stop doing it if I don&#39;t like it? I hate committing long-term to things that don&#39;t work out.\n  This &#34;investment mindset&#34; has kept paying dividends for me - sometimes years later. Here are some of my &#34;investments&#34; that were not successful - or profitable - in the short term, but they brought outsized value the long term.\n Investing time building a social app on a small Facebook competitor that everyone ignored. While everyone I knew was building Facebook apps during the &#34;apps gold rush&#34;, in 2009, I decided to give a Hungarian social network  iWiW a go that just launched its app platform.\n I was thinking: what do I have to lose? The time I spend on the project. What do I have to gain? Experience building an app and a fair chance to build an app that can become  really popular.\n It turns out very few people took a risk on a new app network - by being early and investing a few weekends, I created  apps serving 1M users while I was in college, including more than 200,000 users on New Years&#39; day. This gave me incredibly valuable learnings on how to  build reliable distributed systems - as my DIY database setup crumbled under the load.\n  Building a Windows Phone app in the middle of the iPhone apps gold rush. In 2010, iPhone apps were taking off. Microsoft announced joining the smartphone race with Windows Phone 7. I decided to target to have an app ready for day one: a cocktail app. I had the database already with my website, and the concept worked.\n What would I lose? Time spending on this. What would I gain? Experience building native mobile apps and being on a new App Store early on.\n Teaming up with friends, we  launched Cocktail Flow - which became one of the only apps that were better on Windows Phone than any other app on iPhone or Android. I met many fellow Windows Phone developers, was invited to speak at meetups and conferences, and had a lot of doors open. All because we built a high-quality app early and on a platform that most other developers ignored at the time.\n This app led to Skyscanner first becoming a client of Team Distinction - a company formed by the other three friends helping build the app - then  acquiring their company later on. It also led to Whatsapp co-founder  Jan Koum reaching out to collaborate later on - an opportunity that - in hindsight - I should have said yes to but passed on.\n Saying &#34;yes&#34; to starting from scratch on a new technology. When I applied at Uber, the recruiter messed up my interviews. Instead of interviewing for a mobile role - I was doing iOS development - I was put on a backend loop. I went along and cleared these interviews, to the amazement to everyone - including myself.\n The reason I was able to do well was that in the past I said &#34;yes&#34; to learning new technologies. When I was working at Skype, I volunteered to help work on the backend of Skype on Outlook.com, even though I was a frontend engineer by title. I needed to learn a lot, and my performance review and promotion prospects probably suffered due to me getting up to speed. But it helped me gain hands-on experience building a backend that served in the range of 10,000 QPS and 400 million monthly users.\n Writing a book. Everyone who has written a book - including me - will tell you that it&#39;s just not worth it financially to do it. If you do the math: the hours you spent on a book come to below minimum wage for 99% of the books written.\n However, writing a book also  forces you to research a topic really well. By doing months of research while writing  The Tech Resume Inside Out, I probably know more about what makes a good software engineering resume than 99.9% of other people. At the very least, I&#39;ve spent more time on this niche topic - CVs for developers - than almost anyone else in the world.\n As I was writing  Building Mobile Apps at Scale, I learned about things I wish I knew earlier, like  pseudolocalization. I also connected with people heading up large mobile teams at well-known tech companies and got far more involved in the &#34;large scale&#34; mobile apps community than I ever thought I would.\n  With any investment, you put in resources: time and money. It&#39;s not wise to keep doing this indefinitely, especially when the results are not clear. Many of my &#34;investments&#34; were not worth it: either they were too painful in the short-term, or I just realized the long-term benefits are not relevant for me.\n Maintaining an open-source project turned out to be far bigger of a burden than I expected and with no real upside that was relevant for me. In 2012, I open-sourced  an ad-rotating component for Windows Phone that helped maximize my ad revenue. I figured this might help others make more money in their apps as well, and intended to offer it as a &#34;works for me&#34; approach.\n Soon, I was overwhelmed by support requests to make the component work for use cases I didn&#39;t have and did not want to support. These were fellow developers who opened issues and expected me to fix them, all while the fixes would have helped them make more money. I didn&#39;t like this setup. Luckily software engineer Simon Jackson,  stepped up to maintain the project and did a fantastic job throughout the next years. I learned that open-source maintenance is not my type of investment.\n Organizing a conference was an activity that I&#39;m happy I did once: only to learn it is not something I personally want to do. While I did meet speakers, I didn&#39;t feel positive about the experience due to too many moving parts. For every other &#34;investment&#34; I did, I  liked doing it. Perhaps the long-term efforts would be worth it, but I decided this type of activity is not for me, at least for now.\n My &#34;investment mindset&#34; and enjoying what I do go hand-in-hand and saying no to things that bring stress, anxiety, or negativity are important in keeping up with this approach.  Daniel Vasallo has a &#34;small bets&#34; mindset where cutting these &#34;bets&#34; short is trivial, as the effort you put in them is small enough.\n  I find the investment mindset and the entrepreneurial mindset to be connected. Making an investment involves a limited risk: you might lose all your invested time or money. It also involves a much less limited upside: your investment might repay itself multiple times.\n This mindset is very similar to starting a company - except the stakes are higher. When starting a company, you&#39;re investing a lot more time, and a lot more money than with some of the &#34;smaller&#34; investments.\n It is no surprise that my next investment will be  starting a startup. But first, I&#39;m going through some of my other investments: finishing  writing my remaining books on software engineering.\n What is the activity you&#39;re investing in that makes no real profit in the short-term but can have good upside in the long term?\n  Liked this article?

", "note_en": "Permissions, also known as authorization, is the process of granting access to resources in your system. For any team, it\u2019s crucial to get permissions right. At Carta, where we are working with financial data all day, it\u2019s the  most important thing.\n But we had a problem. Instead of maintaining one legacy system, we were maintaining  five. The permissions could conflict \u2014 and they were impossible to extend. Our business needs were growing, and we had several new products in the funnel.\n It was obvious we had to build a new authorization system to create leverage for engineering and product. We knew we needed it to be three things:\n  Sounds simple enough, but in reality it\u2019s not that easy. In my career, I\u2019ve seen permission systems that are too simple. They lack the features to support fine-grained access on single resources. I\u2019ve also seen them too complex. One small change might unravel a whole policy of attribute-based permissions.\n In this article, we\u2019ll look at how my team \u2014 Identity and Access Management \u2014 took a creative approach to avoid those pitfalls by rebuilding Carta\u2019s permissions system based on Google Zanzibar.\n  Our work began in mid-2019 when we started decomposing our monolithic application. Engineers were developing decomposed services and needed a way to authorize incoming requests. Permission data was still coupled to the legacy permission system in the monolith.\n Our first experiment was a distributed, token-based access control system. We passed user permission data between services with an encoded  JWT token. Distributed tokens made access checks fast, but there was a huge cost to build them. Token build times had a very long tail and caused performance issues for power users with large permission sets.\n  Some tokens reached almost 1mb (!!) in size. Almost every request payload had an embedded token and response times would suffer as large tokens passed between services.\n Additionally, the authorization token was not extendable. Service owners had to build their own system for new permission sets. We decided to scrap the authorization token and investigate other options.\n  During our discovery process, we evaluated both open source and vendor products. Many of the projects we evaluated were not granular enough to handle our use cases, so we ruled them out. Then we turned our focus on avoiding vendor lock-in.\n We identified a promising project named  Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA is a framework that provides a single interface for authorization checks.\n OPA serves as a system of record for authorization policies. Domain services push code-defined permission policies to OPA. Network traffic passes through OPA and policies are used to either authorize or deny incoming requests. OPA is built for distributed systems, so it scales well across a cluster.\n OPA has some downsides. It requires a large set of self-managed infrastructures. Permission checks are also slow. With OPA, the consumer controls the underlying data source. You store policy code in OPA, but policies query domain-level data for access checks. This worked fine for simple permissions, but complex ones caused major issues for us.\n Complex permissions often queried several data models and added hundreds of milliseconds to response times. That wasn\u2019t going to work for us.\n  Other projects failed to meet the requirements for our data because they operated on role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC grants access to users via permissive roles. Roles break down with large data sets due to a phenomenon called \u201crole explosion.\u201d\n  Role explosion is caused when users have many roles for several different system entities. (For example, if a user has four roles for 10 different entities, the user has 40 managed roles.) This number has no upper bound and can become millions of managed roles if there are thousands of entities in the system.\n At Carta, user permissions are complex because they\u2019re scoped to portfolio assets. A user has access to their individual portfolio for a set of shares they own. They also may access securities through a fund that is invested in the company. Or the fund might even invest in another fund which owns shares in the company. On top of all that, the company might have access to your portfolio so they can administer securities.\n Users have permission on each portfolio they can access. With millions of portfolios and securities on the platform, our permissions system has to manage a large amount of individual roles.\n  Mid-2019, Google released a white-paper titled \u201c Zanzibar: Google\u2019s Consistent, Global Authorization System.\u201d\n Google uses Zanzibar to service millions of authorization requests per second. Several high-traffic products, including YouTube and Drive, use Zanzibar for authorization. Zanzibar is powerful because it is scalable, flexible, and fast.\n One of Zanzibar\u2019s core features is a uniform language that is used to define permissions. Zanzibar consumers use the uniform language to build Access Control Lists (ACLs). ACLs are like unix file permissions. They give users access to individual resources in the system.\n With Zanzibar, services compose abstractions for user permission groups. User permission groups can compose each other. They also grant access to low-level resource ACLs.\n Unlike OPA, Zanzibar is the source of truth for the data. Consumers simply add permissions without thinking about how to implement fast lookups.\n  But we had a problem: There weren\u2019t any open source implementations available. We decided to build our own system, adding several of our own modifications to make it an even better fit for Carta.\n  At this point, I\u2019ll start referring to our next-gen authorization system as AuthZ. AuthZ stands for authorization.\n AuthZ configures permissions by adding and removing RelationTuples. A RelationTuple is a tuple consisting of an actor, relation, and object.\n Actor: The entity performing the action (e.g. User:Bob). An actor can also be a grouping of entities (e.g. Group:7 Members). It can even be a non-user (e.g. Service:Notification-Service).\n  Each part of the RelationTuple is freeform, so we don\u2019t limit the type of permissions that you can set with AuthZ. For example, \u201cread\u201d and \u201cissue_certificates\u201d are both valid permissions.\n Consumers combine RelationTuples using a domain-specific language. RelationTuples create direct access between actors and objects. RelationTuples automatically imply indirect access between actors and objects. I\u2019ll explain later how this makes AuthZ so powerful.\n Direct Relation: A row in the database that has been explicitly set by a client\n Indirect Relation: A row that does not exist in the database, but the graph gives access to the actor through an indirect relation.\n  RelationTuples construct a permission graph. Consumers query the permission graph to determine if an actor has access to an object. An actor has access to an object if there is either a direct or indirect relationship between the actor and the object. (A good mnemonic for this process: \u201cActors act on Objects.\u201d)\n Traversing the graph is expensive, so AuthZ maintains a custom secondary index. The secondary index responds to access checks on the permissions graph in sub-10ms response times.\n The architecture of this system is out of the scope of this article. We\u2019ll post about it later, so follow Building Carta for updates.\n  At Carta, we start every new project by building a minimum viable product (MVP). Internal services are no exception. MVPs help your team collect valuable early feedback. Early feedback prevents your team from spending time building the wrong features.\n   Our team started by aggregating several requirements from our consumers. At that time our authentication token was still used by most domain services to query legacy permissions. Most teams wanted a way to build new permissions.\n We started implementing a basic version of the index algorithm from Zanzibar. Our first goal was to test this system on new permissions.\n  Speed was one of the primary requirements for AuthZ. We built a prototype of the Zanzibar index to verify that we could achieve a similar level of performance.\n Once we built the prototype, we began testing. We conducted several tests with our version of the Zanzibar index. We compared AuthZ\u2019s custom index to a couple alternatives for a baseline metric.\n  The lookup time using the Zanzibar custom index is very fast. Checks on dense graphs aren\u2019t much slower than checks on sparse graphs and the index is an order of magnitude faster than an alternative optimized caching strategy.\n There is an initial cost for building the custom index as seen by the higher average time to add an edge.\n Eventually, this became a non-issue since AuthZ builds the index with an asynchronous pipeline. Consumers don\u2019t have to wait for the index updates to propagate through the system. To reduce load, index updates are also distributed among several workers. As the number of consumers increases, we can scale up workers to process index events faster.\n    AuthZ\u2019s Check endpoint performance impressed our consumers, but they felt like the API lacked features. Most use cases added several RelationTuples. Consumers called AuthZ tens of times during an update. Each call would add an individual RelationTuple.\n There were also some concerns around scalability. At this point the index was not built asynchronously. Thus, updates were slow. Since permissions were added individually, a full update could take several seconds.\n Finally, one of the biggest concerns was lack of visibility into the system. There was no way to inspect permissions once they were pushing into AuthZ. It was impossible to migrate an existing permission model without this feature.\n  This was hard feedback to hear. But this is why Carta works iteratively. They weren\u2019t saying \u201cNo.\u201d They were saying \u201cNot right now.\u201d\n We knew that if we added a couple of features (to our MVP, which was already deployed), we could get the adoption we wanted.\n    This feedback was a positive indicator for our initial requirements. The MVP addressed most of the problems that we set out to solve. The scaling issues weren\u2019t a big deal. We could solve those by implementing more features from the Zanzibar document.\n The MVP identified something we did not predict: Our consumers wanted tooling. They preferred software which helps them use the system, not features on the system itself. We quickly prioritized tooling due to the demand coming from our consumers.\n Our consumers also had issues adding RelationTuples. They didn\u2019t want to make 50 separate requests to bootstrap permissions. Rather they wanted to add multiple permissions in a single call. This customer request became the Template feature.\n  During our initial tests, we built some tools to debug issues with the index. One of the tools was a simple graph visualizer. Given a set of RelationTuples, it was able to generate a JPEG image of the graph.\n  We thought about creating an endpoint to serve this image to our consumers, but quickly decided it was a bad idea. We decided to build query APIs that let consumers view portions of the graph. These APIs acted as our backend. We then created Concord, a web app that acted as our presentation layer to visualize nodes in the graph.\n  This feature alone addressed most of the concerns around discoverability, with the ability to identify and inspect permissions previously added.\n   During our test sessions, we noticed some services botched other services\u2019 permissions. This happens when two services apply updates to the same permission type.\n For instance, one service might add a permission for a bank account. Another might add a permission for a user account. Both might try to write a permission with the actor type: \u201cAccount.\u201d One service could overwrite another service\u2019s change.\n  We introduced namespaces to separate domain-level permissions. Namespaces prevent permission overwrites, but promote cross-domain queries. Services write to one or many namespaces where they have write access. If a service attempts to write to a namespace they do not have access to, AuthZ rejects the update and throws an error.\n  Carta uses shared namespaces for a few use cases. For instance, user permissions are in one namespace; document permissions are in another. AuthZ grants the document service access for the Identity public namespace. Document service can give a user access to a document permission.\n   We solved the bulk update problem (add multiple permissions) by introducing RelationTuple templates. Templates allow consumers to predefine a set of changes that are applied in AuthZ. Templates make updates explicit and repeatable.\n Consumers construct templates using  Mustache templating language and pass templates to AuthZ with a set of data when a change occurs. AuthZ injects data into the template and executes a bulk update event.\n   # Set admins for this namespace {{#admin}} authz_service:{{service_id}}, admin, authz_namespace:{{namespace_id}} {{/admin}} # Give other services write access if they need it {{#write}} authz_service:{{service_id}}, create_any_relation, authz_namespace:{{namespace_id}} {{/write}}\n AuthZ uses this template to add permissions for a new namespace. AuthZ injects data for the change event. In this case, the namespace ID and any services that have access to the namespace. The template applies a bulk update to the permissions graph. Future AuthZ calls will include the RelationTuples applied by the template.\n  In some use cases, services display a list of resources that a user has access to (i.e., a search page).\n Traversing the graph with our query API returns the correct data, but it\u2019s expensive. Deep graphs can take seconds to retrieve a results set, as opposed to tens of milliseconds when using the custom index.\n We determined we could repurpose the custom index to retrieve a flat list of resources for an actor. Since consumers effectively flatten the graph, we called this API \u201cFlatten.\u201d\n  The index uses special filters to reduce the results returned to the consumer. Consumers use the output of Flatten to query their database for resources to show to the user.\n List lookups were much faster with the index, but slowed down when consumers used filters.\n We built a  trigram index on top of the custom index to support faster lookups with filters. All these optimizations reduced lookup times to 50ms for the 95th percentile.\n  A constant \u201cbuild, measure, learn\u201d feedback loop enabled our team to deliver immediate value. New features drove adoption across the company. Teams gravitated towards AuthZ because it was performant and easy to use.\n But it wasn\u2019t enough\u2014yet. People wanted to use the new system to query old permissions. To drive further adoption, we implemented a legacy permissions proxy.\n The proxy enables teams to call AuthZ for legacy permissions instead of using the JWT token. Legacy permission checks are slower than AuthZ calls. But the proxy encouraged a single interface. It is much easier to migrate customers on a single interface than it is on two disparate systems.\n Currently, AuthZ services seven different applications in our production environment for about 130 new, unique permission types. We have an average load rate of about 15 requests per second. Our metrics are growing quickly.\n We\u2019re working to replace the legacy permissions proxy with native AuthZ calls. Native AuthZ calls will make checks an order of magnitude faster on average than the proxy. The 95th percentile is more than two orders of magnitude faster.\n AuthZ has made it easier for teams to manage permissions. Developers can build new products without having to build underlying authorization infrastructure.\n  When building something new \u2014 be it an internal service or external product \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid to experiment. Our team had several failures until we built something that our consumers wanted to use. Ultimately, early release was key for us.\n I challenge you to use this process in your own work. Is there a broken system at your company? Can you launch a simple experiment to help build something useful?\n We\u2019ll be covering the architecture of AuthZ in future articles.
