With restaurant profit margins typically low to begin with, many complained that these app startups were gouging them and eating up what little money they might be making on each order, all in the name of convenience.\n San Francisco became one of the first U.S. cities to set a cap on what the apps could charge restaurants when Mayor London Breed  passed an emergency order last April capping the commission fees at 15 percent.\n &#34;In these tough financial circumstances, every dollar counts and can make the difference between a restaurant staying open, or shuttering,&#34; Breed said at the time.\n In Tuesday&#39;s vote, the Board of Supervisors makes the fee cap permanent, with Supervisors Ahsha Safa\u00ed and Aaron Peskin having led the charge. The legislation, which will still get a second vote and may get further amended, allows the app companies to charge extra fees for enhanced services \u2014 such as marketing services that give more prominent placement to a restaurant within an app. But the per-order fee will be capped at 15 percent.\n  &#34;We are happy to have worked with Supervisor Peskin and his staff on this important legislation to set a permanent cap on the delivery commission fees that third party delivery companies place on restaurants in San Francisco. This legislation is well thought out, allowing the ability for restaurant operators to sign a completely separate marketing agreement for additional services, while ensuring that a clear 15% cap will remain on the delivery service. \u00a0This legislation will help ensure our San Francisco restaurants can continue to operate in a financially sustainable way as they recover from the past year plus with limited capacity and lost revenue.&#34;\n  Multiple municipalities and states passed temporary, emergency legislation capping delivery commission fees during the pandemic, but most of these were set to expire after restaurants were allowed to more fully reopen.\n The California legislature failed to pass a permanent 15-percent cap on these fees, which had been championed by San Diego Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez. Instead, back in May, the  Assembly passed AB286, which simply requires more transparency in these fees from the app providers \u2014 showing customers and restaurants exactly who is being charged what in every transaction.\n Temporary caps set by other states, including New York State \u2014 which capped delivery commissions at 15% and marketing fees at 5% \u2014 are set to expire, and legislation to make them permanent still has not passed in most cases.\n The Wall Street Journal  covered the conflict in April, noting that while many restaurants and consumers have come to rely on the apps, many restaurants are &#34;tiring&#34; of paying exorbitant fees.\n The major three \u2014 GrubHub, DoorDash, and UberEats \u2014 have so far declined to comment on San Francisco&#39;s new legislation,  as the Chronicle notes.\n Comments on pending legislation around the country from the apps themselves has tended to focus on the impact on the consumer, saying they&#39;ll have to raise prices if their ability to charge commissions is capped.\n &#34;DoorDash has always supported restaurants,&#34; reads one such statement from earlier this year. &#34;Pricing regulations could cause us to increase costs for customers, which could lead to fewer orders for local restaurants and fewer earning opportunities for Dashers.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:42:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,\u9910\u5385,francisco,\u9910\u9986", "title": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6c38\u4e45\u5730\u5c06\u9910\u5385\u7684\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5e94\u7528\u8d39\u7528\u4e3a15\uff05 ", "title_en": "San Francisco Permanently Caps Delivery App Fees for Restaurants at 15%", "transed": 1, "url": "https://sfist.com/2021/06/23/san-francisco-permanently-caps-delivery-app-fees-at-15/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "\u9910\u5385", "francisco", "\u9910\u9986"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0b08335031c70e9a38d3479b0bec3e29.jpg", "infoid": 1067772, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\uff06\uff0334;

to highlight companies that have increased dividends and reduced outstanding shares for 10 consecutive years or more.\n (On a dual-axis time series chart, the trend-line of the share count and the trend-line of the dividend rate intersect to create an \u201cX&#34; shape.)\n There are at least 18 companies that meet my strictest criteria for inclusion, summarized as:\n    A hypothetical $100,000 portfolio invested equally amongst these companies in June 2011 would be presently valued at more than $750,000, assuming that dividends were reinvested (and notwithstanding the impact of taxes and trading fees).\u2020\n  I believe that a basket of companies using free cash flow growth to pay an increasing dividend and to simultaneously reduce the number of outstanding shares may outperform the broader stock market because of two complementary factors:\n   *In a shareholder&#39;s utopia, all share repurchases would result in fewer outstanding shares, yet this is rarely the case. Many companies use stock buybacks to mitigate executive compensation that is paid out in stock options or restricted stock units. Other companies issue new shares to fund dividend payments.\n  To make the X Factor Index suitable for the majority of investors, it may be necessary to broaden the stock selection criteria while attempting to avoid the dilution of investment returns. (Equity index funds can hold hundreds or thousands of stocks to diversify capital and to protect the investor from an over-concentration in a small number of securities.)\n   This loosened criterion would allow a stock to qualify for the index even if the parent company had a one year &#34;blip&#34; where outstanding shares increased (like Apple) or a multi-year stretch where outstanding shares remained constant (like Church &amp; Dwight).\n Another method is to maintain the strict criteria using a time horizon that is less than 10 years. This may result in higher returns if it allows the investor to &#34;get in early&#34; on a fundamental trend.\n  \u2020 Each of the companies above qualifies for inclusion in the X Factor Index as of this writing, however, this may not have been the case in June 2011. Therefore, the hypothetical 10-year performance of the portfolio above is potentially misleading. Additionally, past performance does not guarantee future results.

", "note_en": "(CNN)Covid-19 deaths have fallen dramatically across the United States -- average daily deaths are less than a tenth of what they were at the peak of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University -- but nearly 300 people are still dying of Covid-19 each day in the US.\n  People who died of Covid-19 in May were younger and more disproportionately Black than those who had died of Covid-19 throughout the pandemic, a CNN analysis of CDC data shows.\n     And Americans who are still dying of Covid-19 are &#34;overwhelmingly&#34; unvaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.\n    &#34;This is exactly what we would expect, given ongoing inequities in vaccine access and a smaller proportion of younger people having been protected by vaccination,&#34; William Hanage, a member of Harvard University&#39;s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and associate professor of epidemiology, told CNN.\n  Deaths are a lagging indicator of disease, following weeks and sometimes months behind initial Covid-19 diagnosis, experts say.\n &#34;For May, we might be looking at a group of individuals diagnosed in March or April, or in some cases even February,&#34; during a time when the US was still prioritizing older adults and those with certain comorbidities to be vaccinated, Dr. Judith O&#39;Donnell, hospital epidemiologist and director of infection prevention and control at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, told CNN.\n People 75 and older have accounted for about 57% of all Covid-19 deaths in the US, but the balance was shifted in May, with 59% of deaths among those under the age of 75 for that month, CDC data shows.\n Instead, those between the ages of 50 and 64 have represented a significantly larger share of deaths recently. In May, about a quarter of deaths occurred in this age group, compared to 16% of total deaths throughout the pandemic.\n And adults under 40 represented about 3% of Covid-19 deaths in May, more than double their share of total deaths since the pandemic began.\n  O&#39;Donnell, who has cared for inpatients with Covid-19, says there is a &#34;striking difference&#34; in the people she&#39;s treated over the past couple of months compared to a year ago, with the average age of hospitalized patients now  two decades younger than it was.\n But it&#39;s not just about age, she said. The same comorbidities -- including heart failure, kidney failure, obesity and history of smoking -- put people of all ages at higher risk, although vaccinations are making a difference.\n &#34;We&#39;re very rarely seeing the older population hospitalized and I think it&#39;s because they heard the vaccine message, rolled up their sleeves and, in most cases, got vaccinated early on,&#34; O&#39;Donnell said.\n &#34;The 18 to 29 group is really undervaccinated right now, and if it stays that way, we&#39;re going to see them accounting for a greater share of hospitalizations and deaths as time goes on.&#34;\n  Black people have also represented a larger share of Covid-19 deaths recently, as well as lower vaccination coverage, CDC data shows.\n  Throughout the pandemic, Black people have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, accounting for about 12.5% of the population but more than 15% of total deaths, according to CDC data.\n That disparity was even larger in May, with nearly 19% of Covid-19 deaths throughout the month among Black people. In recent weeks, Black people and American Indians have been more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic White people to die of Covid-19, CDC data shows.\n Indeed, Black people are the most undervaccinated racial or ethnic group in the US. More than 45% of the US population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, but coverage among Black people is less than half of that, at about 22%.\n &#34;These lower rates may be due in part, to vaccine hesitancy, but they may also be due to inequities in vaccine access,&#34; Dr. Lisa Cooper, founder of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity, told CNN. &#34;Many African Americans in the South live in rural areas with limited access to health care facilities. Furthermore, many people may have other stressors related to housing, food, or job insecurity, which may be preventing them from getting vaccinated.&#34;\n Sign up here to get  The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n The share of Covid-19 deaths among Asian and Hispanic people, however, decreased in May and both groups were underrepresented in their share of Covid-19 deaths relative to their share of the population.\n While vaccination coverage among Hispanic people also lags the US average -- about 25% overall -- rates have been increasing for this group over recent weeks, CDC data shows. And Asian people recently surpassed non-Hispanic White people in terms of vaccination coverage and have had one of the lowest death rates throughout the pandemic.\n &#34;Health equity plays into this because as we have learned over the past year, we are not safe until we are all safe,&#34; Cooper said. &#34;As long as some people in our society don&#39;t have what they need to stay healthy, we are all at risk of the infection spreading, overwhelming our health systems and leading to lockdowns that harm all of us through their negative effects of our psychological and social well-being, our physical health and our economic stability.&#34;\n   Experts stress that continued vaccination efforts are critical to stop the spread of the virus and prevent more deaths.\n &#34;As more Americans have rolled up their sleeves to get vaccinated, we have chipped away at the ability of the Covid-19 virus to cause more illness and more suffering,&#34; Walensky said. &#34;This new virus forced too many of our families to accept death as its outcome for too many of our loved ones, but now, this should not be the case.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:41:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "deaths,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u968f\u7740Covid Deaths\u547d\u4e2d\u4f4e\u70b9\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u66f4\u5e74\u8f7b ", "title_en": "As Covid deaths hit lows, new deaths are younger with more Blacks than before", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/health/covid-deaths-shifting-younger-more-disparities/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["deaths", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "847dafa55d7084b20b83435982c6921e.jpg", "infoid": 1067769, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5468\u4e8c\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u6263\u62bc\u4e8633\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u7531\u4f0a\u6717\u653f\u5e9c\u5206\u652f\u673a\u6784\u7ecf\u8425\uff0c\u57282020\u5e74\u603b\u7edf\u9009\u4e3e\u4e4b\u524d\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u5949\u884c\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fd8\u6263\u62bc\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u6050\u6016\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd0\u8425\u3002\n \u6628\u5929\u53f8\u6cd5\u5ba3\u5e03\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u957f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f0a\u6717\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u5e7f\u64ad\u7535\u89c6\uff08IRTVU\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8633\u4e2a\u4f0a\u6717\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u7531\u4f0a\u65af\u5170\u9769\u547d\u536b\u961f\u961f\u4f0d\uff08IRGC-QF\uff09\u62e5\u6709\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u3002 Doj\u8868\u793aIrtvu\uff06\uff0334;\u9488\u5bf9\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8bfd\u8c24\u7ade\u9009\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u52a8\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \uff06\uff0334;\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4f0a\u6717\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5982\u65b0\u95fb\u7535\u89c6\u548cAl-Alam\uff0c\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5730\u533a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u5e7f\u64ad\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e5f\u95e8\u7684Al-Masirah\u7535\u89c6\u9891\u9053\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u5ba3\u5e03\u7f51\u7ad9\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u5355\u9875\u9648\u8ff0;\u5df2\u88ab\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u6263\u62bc\uff06\uff0339;\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u8054\u90a6\u8c03\u67e5\u5c40\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u52a1\u90e8\u7684\u6d77\u8c79\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

", "note_en": "On Tuesday, the US government said it seized 33 websites run by a branch of the Iranian government that spread disinformation in the US before the 2020 presidential election. The US also seized three websites that it said were operated by an Iraqi terrorist organization.\n Yesterday&#39;s  Department of Justice announcement said the 33 Iranian sites were used by the Iranian Islamic Radio and Television Union (IRTVU), which is owned or controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force (IRGC-QF). The DOJ said the IRTVU &#34;targeted the United States with disinformation campaigns and malign influence operations.&#34;\n &#34;Visitors to leading Iranian media sites like  Press TV and Al-Alam, the country&#39;s main English- and Arabic-language broadcasters, as well as the Al-Masirah TV channel of Yemen&#39;s Huthis, were met with single-page statements declaring the website &#39;has been seized by the United States government&#39; accompanied by the seals of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Commerce Department,&#34; the  AFP wrote. The US\u00a0also &#34;took over the domain name of the news website Palestine Today, which reflects the viewpoints of Gaza-based Islamic militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad,&#34; The Washington Post  reported.\n The US obtained seizure warrants and was able to shut down the sites because the domains were provided by a US company.\n  In October 2020, the Treasury Department&#39;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  sanctioned IRTVU, IRGC-QF, and three other Iranian entities &#34;for attempting to influence elections in the United States.&#34; The sanction announcement described IRTVU as &#34;a propaganda arm of the IRGC-QF.&#34;\n    &#34;The Iranian regime has targeted the United States&#39; electoral process with brazen attempts to sow discord among the voting populace by spreading disinformation online and executing malign influence operations aimed at misleading US voters,&#34; the October 2020 announcement said. &#34;Components of the Government of Iran, disguised as news organizations or media outlets, have targeted the United States in order to subvert US democratic processes.&#34;\n Iranian disinformation campaigns &#34;have targeted a global audience through a variety of covert media organizations&#34; and &#34;focus on sowing discord among readers via social media platforms and messaging applications, and frequently involve mischaracterizing information,&#34; the Treasury Department said.\n &#34;IRGC-QF outlets amplified false narratives in English and posted disparaging propaganda articles and other US-oriented content with the intent to sow discord among US audiences,&#34; the sanction announcement also said.\n The Anti-Defamation League\u00a0 said in 2015 that &#34;Press TV is the Iranian government&#39;s primary English-language propaganda tool, promoting a wide range of pernicious antisemitic conspiracy theories as &#39;news&#39; to a worldwide audience. Operated by the\u00a0Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Press TV serves as a mouthpiece for American anti-Semites, conspiracy theorists, and Holocaust deniers, who help amplify the Iranian regime&#39;s hateful messages.&#34;\n Press TV &#34;push[ed] antisemitic conspiracies about the coronavirus to distract from the mullah regime&#39;s mishandling of the pandemic,&#34; for example by claiming that &#34;Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran,&#34; the Jerusalem Post  wrote in March 2020.\n  The October sanctions classified IRTVU as a Specially Designated National (SDN), meaning it is &#34;prohibited from obtaining services, including website and domain services, in the United States without an OFAC license,&#34; the DOJ said yesterday.\n &#34;The 33 [seized] domains are owned by a United States company. IRTVU did not obtain a license from OFAC prior to utilizing the domain names,&#34; the DOJ said. The DOJ did not identify the US company.\n    Because of the sanctions, all of the designated entities&#39; &#34;property and interests&#34; that are &#34;subject to US jurisdiction are blocked, and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,&#34; the Treasury Department said in October.\n The other three websites seized yesterday were operated by Kata&#39;ib Hizballah (KH), which is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US government. As with IRTVU, KH&#39;s domains &#34;were owned by a United States company&#34; and &#34;KH did not obtain a license from OFAC prior to utilizing the domain names,&#34; the DOJ said.\n KH, which is backed by Iran, launched attacks against US and coalition forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2011. &#34;KH returned its focus to opposing US presence in Iraq&#34; in late 2018 when it &#34;allegedly conducted a rocket attack that took place near the US Consulate in Basra, which was evacuated and indefinitely closed,&#34;  according to Stanford University&#39;s Center for International Security and Cooperation. After that attack and another rocket attack on the US embassy in Baghdad that was carried out by a related group, the US &#34;issued a statement that it would consider attacks carried out by Iranian-backed militias as attacks perpetrated by Iran.&#34;\n  The Iranian government condemned the website seizures, and President Hassan Rouhani&#39;s chief of staff said the US action is &#34;not constructive when talks for a deal on the nuclear issue are under way,&#34;  according to AFP.\u00a0IRIB &#34;accused the US of repressing freedom of expression and joining forces with Israel and Saudi Arabia &#39;to block pro-resistance media outlets exposing the crimes of US allies in the region,&#39;&#34; the AFP wrote.\n The seizures did not erase the Iranian organizations&#39; presence on the Internet. &#34;TV stations such as Press TV and Al-Alam switched to .ir domains and their websites remained accessible. They are also still present on social media, mainly Twitter, and their broadcasts have continued uninterrupted,&#34; the AFP wrote. Additionally, &#34;Al-Masirah quickly established a new website, using its name but swapping the .net domain for .com.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:01:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u56fd\u8425,state", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6263\u62bc33\u5c4a\u4f0a\u6717\u56fd\u8425\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7ad9\u88ab\u6307\u63a7\u9009\u4e3e\u7981\u4ee4 ", "title_en": "US seizes 33 Iranian state-run media sites accused of election disinformation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/us-seizes-33-iranian-state-run-media-sites-accused-of-election-disinformation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u56fd\u8425", "state"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "23b606564728a0865a7729d351286494.png", "infoid": 1067767, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u9c9c\u8d2d\u4e70\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u5927\u7684\u91c7\u8d2d\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u6536\u8d2d\u7684\u6536\u8d2dGlu Mobile\uff0c\u5468\u4e09\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4ee514\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8d2d\u4e70\u534e\u7eb3\u5144\u5f1f\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6e38\u620f\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4Playdex\u3002\u66fc\u5f7b\u65af\u7279\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u56e0\u5176\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u201c\u9ad8\u5c14\u592b\u51b2\u7a81\u201d\u800c\u95fb\u540d\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc78000\u4e07\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5168\u7403\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3002\n \u5f53\u65f6\u72c2\u70ed\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u5730\u88ab\u629b\u5f03\u4e86430\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8b66\u544a\u5144\u5f1f\u6e38\u620f\u5e08\u5c06\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684430\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8b66\u62a5\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a\u63a2\u7d22\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u88ab\u629b\u5f03\u3002\n   \u7535\u5b50\u827a\u672f\u662f\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u578b\u897f\u90e8\u7535\u5b50\u6e38\u620f\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u9650\u4e3a400\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u684c\u9762\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u6743\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6218\u573a\uff0c\u661f\u7403\u5927\u6218\u548c\u6cf0\u5766\u666e\u5229\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u5230\u516c\u53f8\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4fdd\u6301\u6b65\u4f10\uff0c\u5982\u6fc0\u8fdb\u66b4\u96ea\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e89\u593a2016\u5e74\u7684\u56fd\u738b\u6536\u8d2d\u3002\n \u7535\u5b50\u827a\u672f\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8d2d\u4e70\u72c2\u6b22\uff0c\u622a\u81f32021\u5e74\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e09\u5927\u6536\u8d2d\u4ef7\u503c\u7ea650\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 ", "note_en": "Fresh off the $2.4 billion acquisition of Glu Mobile this past April, their biggest purchase to date, Electronic Arts announced Wednesday that they are buying Warner Bros.

It\u2019s believed to be the first time a national law enforcement group carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group.\n The Ukrainian police also claimed at the time to have successfully shut down the server infrastructure used by the gang. But it doesn\u2019t seem the operation was completely successful.\n  While the Clop operation fell silent following the arrests, the gang has this week published a fresh batch of confidential data which it claims to have stolen from two new victims \u2014 a farm equipment retailer and an architects office \u2014 on its dark web site, seen by TechCrunch.\n If true \u2014 and neither of the alleged victims responded to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment \u2014 this would suggest that the ransomware gang remains active, despite last week\u2019s first-of-its-kind law enforcement sting. This is likely because the suspects cuffed included only those who played a lesser role in the Clop operation.  Cybersecurity firm Intel 471 said  it believes that last week\u2019s arrests targeted the money laundering portion of the operation, with core members of the gang not apprehended.\n \u201cWe do not believe that any core actors behind Clop were apprehended,\u201d the security company said. \u00a0\u201cThe overall impact to Clop is expected to be minor although this law enforcement attention may result in the Clop brand getting abandoned as we\u2019ve recently seen with other ransomware groups like DarkSide and Babuk.\u201d\n Clop appears to still be in business, but it remains to be seen how long the group will remain operational. Not only have law enforcement operations dealt numerous blows to ransomware groups this year, such as U.S. investigators\u2019 recent recovery of millions in  cryptocurrency they claim was paid in ransom to the Colonial Pipeline hackers, but Russia has this week confirmed it will begin to work with the U.S. to locate cybercriminals.\n Russia has until now taken a hands-off approach when it comes to dealing with hackers.  Reuters reported Wednesday that the head of the country\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) Alexander Bortnikov was quoted as saying it will co-operate with U.S. authorities on future cybersecurity operations.\n Intel 471 previously said that it does not believe the key members of Clop were arrested in last week\u2019s operation because \u201cthey are probably living in Russia,\u201d which has long provided safe harbor to cybercriminals by refusing to take action.\n The Clop ransomware gang was first spotted in early 2019, and the group has since been linked to a number of high-profile attacks. These include the breach of  U.S. pharmaceutical giant ExecuPharm in April 2020 and the recent data breach at  Accellion, which saw hackers exploit flaws in the IT provider\u2019s software to steal data from dozens of its customers including the\u00a0University of Colorado and cloud security vendor Qualys.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:00:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "TechCrunch recently sat down with  Leading Investor from  Well Known Firm to chat about their investing theses, the state of today\u2019s venture capital market, and why prices are so high for early-stage startups.\n We\u2019ve been hunting down Leading Investor for some time, so it\u2019s great to get their thoughts on today\u2019s startup market and the larger venture capital industry. Let\u2019s have some fun!\n  TechCrunch: To kick things off, the early-stage startup market has been super active lately. How has the accelerating cadence of deal-making impacted how you and Well Known Firm invest?\n Leading Investor: We\u2019ve made no changes to our process. Everyone who has is weak of conviction and poor of wallet.\n TC: Got it, got it. The rapid-fire, early-stage market, though, does seem expensive at times. At least compared to historical norms. Are you worried about overpaying for nascent startup shares?\n LI: Every deal that we\u2019ve been a part of has been fairly priced. Every deal that we didn\u2019t win was overpriced. Every deal we didn\u2019t see was stupid.\n TC: Cool. Sure. Let\u2019s talk about the technology market more generally. Where are you seeing the most startup opportunity? Or perhaps more simply, where are you paying the most attention today for future deals?\n LI: Please consult our portfolio page. Here is a name of a startup we\u2019ve backed. Here\u2019s another. Those are the hot areas and the hot companies. All other areas are ice-cold, overpriced, and generally over-hyped.\n  LI: Let me cut you off there to name drop Eric from Zoom, with whom I have a great relationship. Salesforce. Snowflake. On-demand pricing. Historical Twilio reference. Also have you read Recently Published Book? Someone gave me a copy and I read the dust cover. Books are good. I read them.\n TC: Right. Turning to the venture capital market, how competitive is Well Known Firm these days? Other firms are offering more services in addition to capital than you are. Does that impact your win rate in competitive deals?\n LI: Our firm\u2019s services are real and impactful and accretive. Other VCs offer services but don\u2019t deliver. You have to deliver. Delivery is key. We\u2019re like the AWS of service delivery. Except free. We only demand the right to profit from founder success while enriching ourselves as the cost of our fine, free services.\n TC: All right. Let\u2019s talk about the exit market. We\u2019ve seen a pretty active IPO market, and TechCrunch has heard that SPACs are getting incredibly frisky, even pinging Series B-funded companies in case they want to go public. What\u2019s your take on that?\n LI: Here\u2019s a generic answer that doesn\u2019t answer your question but ensures that my portfolio companies continue to receive all possible inbound in case we need to float a company that won\u2019t make it as a venture-backed, private company. Public investors are dumb and will happily hold our bags. They are the valets of the investing world.\n TC: Last question, how are returns at your firm? You\u2019ve raised successively larger funds over the years. Is your IRR holding up as you\u2019ve taken more capital under management?\n LI: Recall that Well Known Firm invested in Very Old Company, so our returns have historically been strong. Regarding Every Deal Since Then, it\u2019s a bit too soon to tell. But recall Very Old Company that did well.

Carriers and fleets can pay a per-mile subscription fee to access it. The company includes carriers Mesilla Valley Transportation and Bison Transport, and companies Anheuser-Busch InBev and HP Inc., amongst its partners.\n Carriers purchase trucks with compatible hardware directly from OEMs, so Embark says it has designed its system to be \u201cplatform agnostic\u201d across multiple components and manufacturers. The company says its software can simulate up to 1,200 60-second scenarios per second, and make adaptive predictions using those scenarios for the behaviour of other vehicles on the road.\n  Embark said in an investor presentation for the SPAC deal that it was targeting \u201cdriver-out,\u201d or operating on roads without a safety driver, by 2023 and launching at a commercial scale across the American sunbelt the following year. However, Embark still has technical milestones yet to achieve, noting in the presentation that the software still needs to accomplish actions such as interactions with emergency vehicles, and responding to blown tires and other mechanical failures.\n  Upon closing, the transaction will inject Embark with around $615 million in gross cash proceeds, including $200 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding from investors including CPP Investments, Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.\n Embark also said former Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao was joining its board, likely a boon for a company operating in the autonomous trucking industry, which is still only authorized for commercial deployment in 24 states.\n Embark was founded in 2016 by CEO Alex Rodrigues and CTO Brandon Moak, who worked together on autonomous driving while completing engineering degrees from Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo.

These stars, within 100 parsecs (or about 326 light-years) of the sun, were found using data from NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the European Space Agency\u2019s  Gaia mission.\n  And with thousands of exoplanets already found orbiting other stars in our universe, could we have already seen life on other planets come and go? Might they have seen us?\n  \u201cThe universe is dynamic,\u201d says  Lisa Kaltenegger, director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell, and lead author of the study. \u201cStars move, we move. First the Earth moves around the sun, but the sun moves around the center of our galaxy.\u201d\n  About 70% of exoplanets are found using the transit method: when a planet passes between a star and an observer, the star dims enough to confirm the presence of a previously unseen celestial body.\n  Kaltenegger and coauthor  Jackie Faherty of the American Museum of Natural History compiled a list of stars that either will see or already have seen Earth transit in their lifetimes. Of these, they found seven stars with orbiting exoplanets that could potentially be habitable.\n  Statistically, one out of four stars has a planet that exists in the \u201cGoldilocks zone\u201d\u2014not too hot, not too cold, and just far away from a star to support life. But how do we determine whether faraway exoplanets meet these criteria?\n  When transiting exoplanets block stellar light, part of that light filters through the atmosphere. Energy and light interact with the molecules and atoms of that planet, and by the time that light reaches an astronomer\u2019s telescope, scientists can determine whether it has interacted with chemicals like oxygen or methane.\n    \u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is people could have seen that the Earth was a habitable planet since about 2 billion years [ago], because of the oxygen buildup in the atmosphere,\u201d she says.\n  The idea of studying transits to find out if we\u2019re on someone else\u2019s radar isn\u2019t really new. Kaltenegger attributed much of her inspiration to a plan the SETI Institute, which pursues the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, had in the 1960s.\n  In 1960, a radioastronomer named Frank D. Drake was the first person to try to detect  interstellar radio transmissions, focusing on two stars 11 light-years away and similar in age to our sun. Though that attempt was unsuccessful, scientists and amateur enthusiasts have continued to look for such signals ever since.\n  But whether the signals we send are getting through is another matter entirely. In the new study, Kaltenegger and Faherty reported that human-made radio waves had already swept over the 75 closest stars on their list.\n  Even though humans have been sending out radio waves for roughly 100 years, that\u2019s nothing compared with Earth\u2019s billions of years of planetary evolution.\n   Meanwhile, much of our own solar neighborhood is still unexplored, but that\u2019s where missions like TESS, Gaia, and  Kepler come in. TESS spends months looking at different sectors of the universe in its hunt to find exoplanets, and Gaia seeks to create a three-dimensional map of the entire Milky Way. But Kepler was made to observe one patch of sky for longer periods of time\u2014the perfect way to track exoplanets using the transit method.\n  \u201cWith both Kepler and Gaia, one of the really big advantages was that they were able to sort of stare for a long time at the stars,\u201d says  Douglas Caldwell, a SETI researcher and instrument scientist for the Kepler mission.\n  Caldwell says missions dedicated to specific science goals like Gaia offer a kind of precision that he hopes will bode well for future astronomical discoveries.\n  \u201cSpace is really, really huge, and these

\u201cnext generation\u201d of Windows event is taking place later this week, on June 24th at 11AM ET. Thanks to a  big Windows 11 leak, we already have a good idea of what to expect from Microsoft\u2019s event.\n Microsoft is widely expected to announce a new version of Windows, named Windows 11.  Microsoft has been teasing \u201ca new version of Windows\u201d recently and has dropped a number of hints that it\u2019s likely to be Windows 11. This special Windows event starts at 11AM ET, and the invite includes a window that creates a shadow with an outline that looks like the number 11. Microsoft execs have also been teasing a  \u201cnext generation of Windows\u201d announcement for months, and an  11-minute video has teased a new Windows 11 startup sound.\n We\u2019re expecting Windows 11 to include a new user interface, new Windows store, and much more. We\u2019ll be covering the whole event live at  The Verge, but here\u2019s a rundown of what we expect to see.\n   We\u2019ve known for months that Microsoft has been working on UI improvements to Windows, and it looks like most of them will appear in Windows 11.  A leaked version of the operating system includes an updated design, with a new Start menu that now appears centered on the taskbar.\n  It\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve  seen in Windows 10X, which Microsoft canceled in favor of bringing parts of that OS to the main version of Windows. The 10X version of Windows was originally built for dual-screen devices, but Microsoft has now put that work on hold.\n The new Start menu in Windows 11 acts as more of a launcher in the leaked copy, allowing you to find recently used documents or favorite apps quickly. The Live Tiles that originally appeared in Windows 8 are now gone, but you can still move the Start menu to the left-hand side of the screen.\n There are other subtle UI improvements beyond just the Start menu and button. We\u2019re expecting to see a big focus on rounded corners with Windows 11 and new improvements to multitasking across tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs. The leaked copy doesn\u2019t have every UI change, and we\u2019re expecting additional changes to the taskbar, notification center, and general parts of Windows like the volume pop-up and more.\n  We also anticipate Microsoft will spend time talking about its new store approach in Windows 11. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella teased \u201csignificant updates\u201d for Windows that will focus on the economic opportunity for developers and creators. \u201cWe will create more opportunity for every Windows developer today and welcome every creator who is looking for the most innovative, new, open platform to build and distribute and monetize applications,\u201d  said Nadella last month.\n  Microsoft has  reportedly been working on a new Windows store that\u2019s open to all apps and games. The overhaul could pave the way for developers to submit any Windows application to the store, including browsers like Chrome or Firefox, and even allow third-party commerce platforms in apps.\n Enabling third-party commerce platforms across apps found in the Windows store would allow developers to bypass the 15 percent cut that Microsoft takes from developers who use in-app payments. That would be a significant change, during a time when Microsoft, Epic Games, and others are  piling on the pressure for Apple to make changes to its App Store policies.\n Microsoft  recently announced a reduction to the 30 percent cut it takes from PC games on the Windows store, too. This has dropped to just 12 percent, below the 15 percent cut it takes on apps. It matches what Epic Games offers in its own store, and the move will likely put more pressure on Valve\u2019s Steam store.\n   While Microsoft has tried to entice creators, developers, and others to Windows in the past, we\u2019re expecting the company to focus on core improvements in Windows 11 that will benefit those who rely on the operating system daily.\n Microsoft was surprised to see Windows usage explode during the pandemic, and it feels like Windows 11 is the chance to prove the company has invested more in the overall health of its decades-old operating system. We\u2019re hoping to see a bigger focus on productivity and even some power user features, alongside the usual improvements to security that Microsoft typically delivers with new Windows versions.\n We\u2019ve seen hints at improving the multitasking interface across desktop PCs and even tablets in the leaked version of Windows 11, with a new UI that lets you easily snap apps. Microsoft is also improving how it  handles multiple monitor support in Windows 11, bringing an end to the frustrations that power users have experienced for years.\n There\u2019s also an opportunity for Microsoft to focus more on gaming with Windows 11. It\u2019s been a big area of focus  on the Xbox side recently, and Microsoft admitted years ago that it has  a lot of work to do on Windows PC gaming. Some of that has already started with a new Xbox app we expect to see bundled in Windows 11, and the  impressive Xbox Game Bar. But there are some underlying changes Microsoft can make to Windows to improve PC gaming and performance.\n We\u2019re expecting to hear more about the  Auto HDR feature from Xbox that\u2019s coming to Windows, alongside improvements like  DirectStorage that will speed up game load times. We\u2019d also love to see some improvements around game security, to prevent aimbots and wallhacks in games, but we\u2019re not expecting Windows 11 to solve this complicated problem alone. Microsoft does have a chance to prove it\u2019s more committed to PC gaming with Windows 11, particularly as it\u2019s the platform of choice for PC gamers.\n  We\u2019re expecting Windows 11 to be a free upgrade for any PC running Windows 10 right now. Microsoft focused heavily on free upgrades to Windows 10 during its launch period, and it wouldn\u2019t make sense to suddenly start charging for Windows 11. Microsoft makes most of its Windows revenue through OEM or commercial licenses, so a free upgrade to Windows 11 for consumers seems like a no-brainer.\n  Stay tuned to The Verge  on June 24th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT.

Engineers push to the main branch and request reviews when they think it&#39;s necessary. In this blog post, I outline how we built an engineering culture that is based on trust and allows us to move incredibly fast.\n  When Petr and I started Raycast, we were sitting next to each other in the same flat for three months. Every day, we built features to iterate as fast as possible to something users want. At this time, we didn&#39;t do any code reviews and trusted each other blindly. If there was a technical question, we solved it in person, committed the code to the main branch and moved on to the next problem.\n When we started to grow our distributed team, we asked ourselves if we should adopt code reviews. Common wisdom tells you that pull requests are best practice in high-performing engineering teams. But we liked the trust, collaboration and speed of our &#34;process&#34; and decided to\u00a0  not\u00a0require code reviews. Instead, every engineer has the right to push their changes to the main branch. They can request a review if they want somebody else to take another look at their code. Sometimes this happens after the change has landed in the trunk.\n  We use GitHub for source control, which comes with the concept of pull requests (PR) for code reviews. Typically, an engineer works on a task and then proposes their changes to the repository. After a discussion and potential changes, the engineer merges their changes into the base branch. This model works great for open source and allows strangers to contribute to projects. However, we found it impractical for our team for a few reasons:\n Pull requests discourage trust.\u00a0Proposing every code change that somebody else has to approve doesn&#39;t feel encouraging for teams that should operate with a high degree of trust. There are more efficient ways to collaborate on code.\n Pull requests don&#39;t prevent bugs.\u00a0Reviewing code is hard! You can catch obvious mistakes, but you won&#39;t have consistent in-depth scrutiny. Many issues reveal themselves only after extensive use, which doesn&#39;t happen during code reviews. We rely on fast iterations with  user feedback.\n Pull requests slow down.\u00a0Code reviews aren&#39;t high priority for engineers. They have to make time to clean up their review queue. In reality, PRs are an afterthought and not what you want to spend your time on as an engineer.\n We value\u00a0 full responsibility\u00a0and all our engineers own features from ideation to maintenance. Our engineering culture reflects this by giving engineers the freedom to push to the main branch and only request code reviews if they think it&#39;s necessary.\n  Our goal is to dogfood changes as quickly as possible. For this, everybody works on the main branch. This produces a constant stream of changes that can be immediately tested by others. Our continuous integration builds and tests every commit. In addition, we trigger an internal release every night which includes all changes that got committed during the day. Each release is automatically installed for the entire team. This allows us to test new changes within 24 hours.\n The daily internal releases make it simple to collect a lot of feedback to iron out bugs or usability issues. If the team is happy with the quality of a feature, it gets released as part of our next public release. If it needs further iterations, we use a feature flag to keep it internal. This workflow helps us to consistently ship\u00a0 updates every other week.\n Side note:\u00a0We use rebase instead of merge to keep a much cleaner project history and eliminate unnecessary merge commits.\n There are some situations when we request code reviews. If we touch a new part of the codebase, we open a pull request. A good example for such a change is adding a database migration for the first time. Nobody wants to screw up the production environment and rather double checks it. Often new team members request code reviews for the first couple of weeks to familiarize themselves with our codebase. Over time, they gain confidence to work on bigger changes and start pushing to the main branch directly.\n It doesn&#39;t always have to be a PR. Sometimes it&#39;s enough to make a teammate aware of a particular change with a &#34;post-commit message&#34;. After somebody committed their change, they link the relevant person in a Slack channel that is subscribed to our repository or on the commit on GitHub itself. This is useful for changes that could affect the work of others. This is also a great way to avoid blocking code reviews due to time differences. If there is some problem that needs the input of multiple engineers, we hop on a quick\u00a0 Around\u00a0video call and use screen sharing to collaborate. This is handy to sort out bigger topics such as refactoring parts of the codebase or aligning on features that depend on each other.\n We found this way of working more effective. It avoids isolated work on long-lived branches and creates momentum through the continuous updating of the app.\n  Every company or team is different, but one thing is the same: They all want to build the best product in the shortest time possible. There are different ways to achieve this. Ours is to bet on our team and give all engineers the trust to do their best job. This includes letting them decide whenever they want their code reviewed by somebody else. This might be not the right process for other teams that have more strict security requirements. So far, this works well for us. It allows us to rapidly iterate on features, attract great engineers who want to tackle big problems, and establish an asynchronous communication culture that fits our fully distributed team.\n It&#39;s up to you and your colleagues to set the rules for your team.

You\u2019ll even learn how to make a lot of money along the way.\n One of  our recent episodes of React Native Radio seemed to have hit a nerve. In it, we discussed how to get a job or get consulting work as a React or React Native developer, and has brought exponentially more emails to my inbox with people either grateful for the discussion, or with questions about their particular situation.\n Speci  fically though, I\u2019ve had quite a few people reach out to me asking questions about getting into  consulting. In my consulting career, I\u2019ve had the fortune of working with companies all the way from fortune 500 (Amazon, Samsung, American Express, Visa), to small startups and everything in between (Warner Bros, Indeed).\n The advice we offer on that podcast episode and the advice offered in this blog post will apply to  anyone in the software field looking to either make a name for themselves, make more money, or to have more control in their dealing with clients and over their lives.\n Why should you listen to me? Well, maybe you shouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s up to you, but hear me out.\n Over the past 8 or so years I\u2019ve invested a lot of time and money into  books, paid mentorships, and paid time to consultants (that already were where I wanted to be one day) for their knowledge, and I am sharing the information I paid for here for free.\n I\u2019ve also managed to make between $200,000 and $400,000 a year for 4 years consecutively while living in Mississippi, a place without much opportunity for developers.\n I\u2019ve distilled the knowledge &amp; advice I\u2019ve received from these specialists and the techniques that have worked for me into seven items:  Building Bridges,  Specialization,  Content,  Flat Rate Pricing, Networking,  Image, &amp;  Learning.\n  A few years ago I was really into  Angular. I attended the NG Vegas conference, and there I saw one of the best talks I\u2019ve ever seen (by  Aaron Frost) that I still think about to this day:  Building Bridges.\n   This talk has helped frame my thought process as a developer and a person for the next couple of years, and implementing the ideas put forth in this talk has been extremely fulfilling both personally and professionally.\n The only reason I am where I am today is because of the work other people have done, the tutorials they have made, the open source projects they have created and tirelessly contributed to. I have since made it a priority to pay my way back in any way that I can.\n Depending on your confidence and level of expertise,  building bridges could look like many things. For me this has been free one on one mentorship, writing blog posts on things that I\u2019ve learned, hosting and paying for a  local meetup for over 3 years, &amp; answering questions on  Stack Overflow among other things.\n Not only does  building bridges help other people, it also helps you. Teaching and mentoring forces you to understand things on a deeper level than you would have otherwise felt the need to address or dig into. Questions that you did not know existed get answered when you are forced to explain something technical.\n   One of the best pieces of advice I\u2019ve acted on is deciding to specialize.\n Imagine that you have labeled yourself as a \u201cWeb Developer\u201d. When marketing yourself it would be easy to get lost in the millions of online ads, websites, blog posts, and general spam associated with this general term. The same goes for other general labels like Back End Developer, App Developer, etc\u2026 These developers end up competing on price, likely spinning their wheels and working with sub-par clients in the process.\n Imagine if you now change your strategy, persona, and marketing to being known as a \u201cProgressive Mobile Web Application Developer\u201d. You\u2019ve drastically differentiated yourself. Sure you will have less people looking for you, but when someone is looking for exactly what you do  you will be the one they want.  But you could and should go even deeper and more specialized.\n Some examples of specialists that I\u2019ve seen excel in the real world are: Python Training, Postgres Database Query Optimization, Mobile Development for Credit Unions, Progressive Mobile Web Applications for Financial Institutions, Cross Platform Mobile Applications for Furniture Stores, Python Machine  Learning Training, Node APIs.\n Being a specialist allows you to charge more, have more control over your terms, and generally work with more respect from your clients.\n You are not losing out on the millions of people that weren\u2019t finding you in the first place, you are instead standing out as a big fish in a small pond, VS a small fish in a large ocean.\n Companies are also more likely to bring you in more quickly and with more money as a specialist because you do not need much onboarding (onboarding that costs them time &amp; money). If you are already specialized in the thing they need you for, you can get up and running on their team extremely quickly, ultimately saving them both time  and money.\n Specialists also become much more efficient at the thing they specialize in. You will be able to build &amp; ship much more quickly, making your higher rate not only justifiable but actually cheaper for your client at the end of the contract.\n I\u2019ve learned a lot about specialization from books like  The One Thing,  The Freelancers Show Podcast, and paid time from other successful consultants.\n  Today  anyone can write a book or blog post or create a video series on YouTube. The more content you create, the more you learn and the more you increase the ability for potential clients to find you. You also position yourself as  an authority on the subject.\n This also allows you to stand out to your competition. When a client Googles your name, who is she more likely to seek out? If you are seen as the authority, the person that teaches your competition, the decision becomes a no brainer.\n This also goes back to \u201cBuilding Bridges\u201d, when you learn something new, give that knowledge away, it helps the community and it helps you!\n This now brings us to training. Offer workshops and on site training in the technology that you specialize in. This often opens the door to new clients, as they will buy training and then realize your expertise and value, and offer you more work on their project as a consultant. Again, this brings us back to what I mentioned earlier: If you are seen as the person that teaches your competition, the sale is already in the bag.\n And this is for good reason. After teaching a couple of classes, you gain a deeper level of understanding and can work much more efficiently. If you can accomplish the job 4x faster than your competition, charging 1.5 or 2x more is still much cheaper for your customer.\n After paying for mentorship and specialists for their time, I\u2019ve realized there are two big secrets in the high paying consulting industry:  training and  flat rate pricing.\n   Say for instance your hourly rate is $125.00, and you are billing 35 hours a week.\n If you work 48 weeks a year, the  max you can make is $210,000.00. Now, this is of course  really good money, but it is also a ceiling that you will not be able to break out of without negatively effecting either your quality of life or quality of work, or raising your rates.\n The solution to this dilemma is flat rate pricing. The gist of flat rate pricing is that  instead of charging for your time, you are charging for the value that you are providing to your customer.\n Imagine that your on site training will improve developer efficiency by 10% over the next 12 months for a class of 20 developers. If each developer costs them $200,000.00 per year, you are saving the company $400,000.00 that year alone with your training.\n It makes much financial sense to charge 10% ($40,000.00) of this amount for your services, even if only takes you two days to complete.\n Imagine if you were to turn this into hourly billing? Your rate would be $2,500.00 per hour were you charging hourly for 8 hour days.\n Billing based on value makes this invoicing and pricing discussion much more digestible than if you were to just come out and say that you are billing $2,500.00 per hour!\n This also applies to software development. If an e-commerce application you are building will bring in $500,000.00 in sales in the next year, then charging 10% to 20% of this amount is acceptable. The same goes with feature implementation. If your feature will save them $200,000.00 in the next year, price with that in mind vs the hourly rate.\n Jonathan Stark has a lot of great advice on flat rate pricing, including a podcast and a book. Check out his website  here.\n  Many gigs won\u2019t work out with flat rate pricing unfortunately. For me, less than half of my income came from flat rate pricing.\n What kind of gigs would I instead opt for billing hourly? If I\u2019m working on a team with other engineers &amp; we are banging out features or improving an existing application by fixing bugs &amp; or adding improvements, it usually makes more sense to bill hourly. So how much can or should you bill?\n  Does this mean gouging the client? Absolutely not. Your time is valuable. At first when I didn\u2019t have any work my hourly rate was low. I started off billing in the range of $50\u2013$75 / hour. As my hours filled up &amp; I started getting more opportunities, I raised my rates.\n Just like any free market you should choose your hourly rate by supply &amp; demand. Raise your rate until the demand equals the supply. I.e. if you are charging $100 / hour &amp; you have another client come in set your rate at $125.00 or $150.00 and see what happens. If you get a bite, propose a raise of your rate for the previous client to $150.00 / hour or move on to the higher paying client. If you have agreed to a certain price for a length of time, don\u2019t renege on your contract but propose the increase once your initial agreement has been completed.\n Does this mean you should abandon projects? Absolutely not. But once your contract is over or if you are just helping out another team then leaving for a higher rate or asking for a higher rate to meet another offer is a smart move.\n In my experience &amp; from what I have seen, the best consultants are billing in in the range of $200 \u2014 $500 / hour &amp; sometimes even more.\n The most I ever billed was $250.00 / hour. Towards the end of my last contracts I was billing an average of $200/hour.\n   Building a network of trusted friends and acquaintances that can help share your ideas and give valuable feedback on your work is an important part of being a successful consultant. Many of the leads I\u2019ve gotten have been as a direct result of my personal network.\n Networking is something I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m too good at though, regardless of how aware and proactive I try to be.\n Some people are really good at conversing with people online. I am always paranoid about saying the wrong thing or something stupid, but I am working on this! Also, imposter syndrome rears its ugly head even after doing this work for x number of years.\n Some people are really great at networking, people like  Kent C. Dodds  Preethi Kasireddy  Ken Wheeler and  Peggy Rayzis are just a few of the many people that come to mind that are naturally good at building communities, and seem to do so effortlessly (though I know it is a lot of work).\n For the software industry, the online network of choice is Twitter. For physical networking, in person conferences and meetups are a great place to meet other likeminded people.\n One thing I\u2019ve noticed is how  kind most of the people in this industry seem to be. If I have any questions or issues, rarely have I reached out with either a question or request for advice and have had a negative encounter with people working in this field. These small connections add up over time, and when you have an opportunity to contribute to their conversation or question in the future, having interacted with them personally in the past is a great icebreaker.\n I\u2019m aware though that I may have a skewed version of these interactions based on my gender and race.\n  Another way to take advantage of networking effects is to take advantage of other people\u2019s networks by providing them free content.\n For example, with Medium, you have the opportunity to guest post on other people\u2019s blogs. I will soon be cross posting to  Michael Jackson\u2019s  ComponentDidBlog, and have had people guest post to our own  React Native Training Blog. The post your reading is cross-posted to  Hacker Noon!\n The way I started the  React Native Radio podcast was by reaching out to Charles Max Wood, the owner of Devchat.tv, and pitching him on the idea for a new podcast. I would do all of the work and pay for the production if he would just let us be on his podcast network, it ended up being a win for both of us.\n If someone has a successful YouTube channel, ask if you can contribute a video to their channel, or maybe think about recording for  Egghead which already has thousands of users.\n  I spent a few thousand dollars hiring trainers &amp; other highly successful consultants that were already making the type of money I wanted to make to get pointers from them. One of the things that I kept on hearing was the question  \u201cWhen someone searches for you online, what is your online Image?\u201d.\n What they wanted to know was how my Twitter, LinkedIn, &amp; other similar online profiles said about me. Do I act &amp; present myself like someone who is a consultant? Does my bio say that I am a specialist &amp; I am a trainer?\n Before I had any clients, I hired a photographer to take pictures of me in an empty room with me in front of a projector with code on it. I used this picture at first to be on my Twitter &amp; LinkedIn profiles.\n They recommended that I change all of my bios so say that I was a consultant specializing in X thing that I wanted to be doing.\n These small changes (pictures of me teaching, changing my bios) immediately paid off. I started getting more &amp; more leads coming in.\n Two of the people who I learned the most from were  Reuven Lerner (Python specialist trainer) &amp;  Anthony Enlish (Business Development Coach).\n  I have made it a priority to spend a chunk of my time every week to learning new things.\n I\u2019m not sure how to quantify the actual benefit from continuous learning, but it has been something I\u2019ve been doing and have been given this advice by many others, so I\u2019m including it here.\n These new things that I\u2019m learning may or may not apply to my current specialization. For example, I\u2019ve recently been diving into Machine Learning (not close to what I\u2019m doing now), but I\u2019ve also been learning Vue (similar field to what I\u2019m doing now).\n It\u2019s hard to find the time to do all of the things I\u2019m laying out here, and learning (many times) gets pushed to the bottom of the priority list. There are a few ways I\u2019ve found to squeeze learning into my day:\n Lunch at my desk \u2014 Some days I eat lunch at my desk. When I do, I usually open up either  Egghead.io or YouTube and watch a quick video or two on something that I\u2019m interested in.\n Audiobooks \u2014 I\u2019m consuming most of my books via audiobooks these days. I use  Audible, but there are many ways to listen, including  Blinkist which basically is like the Cliffs Notes of audio books.\n Scheduling time on my calendar \u2014 I try to schedule at least 2 hours a week (which is still probably not enough) with no other meetings or obligations in order to learn something new and technical.\n  I\u2019ve tried to sum up a lot of what I\u2019ve learned over the past 8 or so years, things that I would have loved to have been taught right away that would have made my life and journey much better.\n One of my favorite books on software consulting specifically, and one that I have read a couple of times and helped me a lot is  The Nomadic Developer, I recommend checking it out if you have time.\n  My Name is  Nader Dabit . I am a Developer Advocate at  AWS Mobile working with projects like  AppSync and  Amplify, and the founder of  React Native Training.\n If you like React and React Native, checkout out our podcast \u2014  React Native Radio on  Devchat.tv.\n If you enjoyed this article,  please clap n number of times and share it!

", "note_en": "We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.\n        The first two videos demonstrate the \u201ctexture sticking\u201d issue in in two \u201ccinemagraphs\u201d created using generators trained on the unaligned FFHQ-U dataset. The looping videos show small random walks around a central point in the latent space. Observe how the details (hairs, wrinkles, etc.) the StyleGAN2 result (left) appear to be glued to the screen coordinates while the face moves under it, while all details transform coherently in our result (right).\n      The following videos show interpolations between hand-picked latent points in several datasets. Observe again how the textural detail appears fixed in the StyleGAN2 result, but transforms smoothly with the rest of the scene in the alias-free generator.\n      We note, in particular, how our alias-free generator appears to have learned to mimic camera motion in the Beaches dataset.\n    The following video illustrates translational equivariance, or lack thereof, in several \u201cbridge\u201d configurations, and aims to visually demonstrate the meaning of EQ-T equivariance scores. In all panels, the first image is the result of running the corresponding generator with analytically translated Fourier input features. The second image has obtained from the first by \u201cuntransforming\u201d the pixels using the inverse translation by an extremely high-quality resampling filter. For a perfectly equivariant generator, the first two images are the same, modulo image boundaries (not shown due to light cropping) and numerical noise from the resampling. The third image visualizes the difference of the first two images. As can be seen, EQ-T scores in the 60 dB range are essentially visually perfect. Please consult the Appendix for technical details.\n    The following video illustrates rotation equivariance in a manner similar to the previous video. Our alias-free Config-T, which has only been designed for translation equivariance, fails completely, as expected. The following comparison method is a variant of Config-T that uses a p4 symmetric G-CNN for rotation equivariance. The model shows a cyclic behavior, where the rotation is exact at multiples of 90 degrees but breaks down at intermediate angles Our alias-free Config-R features high-quality, though not visually perfect rotation equivariance.\n    The following video illustrates the aliasing inherent to pointwise nonlinearities (here, ReLU), and our solution.   Left column:  The original bandlimited signal z. Its ideal version (top) is sampled (middle), and then reconstructed from the samples (bottom). As the sampling rate is high enough to capture the signal, no aliasing occurs.   Middle column:  applying a pointwise non-linearity in the continuous domain (top) yields a non-smooth function due to clipping at the zero crossings. Sampling this signal (middle) and reconstructing the function from the samples (bottom) yields an aliased result, as the high frequencies created by the clipping cannot be represented by the sample grid.   Right column:  applying a low-pass filter to the ReLUed function in the continuous domain (top) yields again a smooth function; sampling it (middle) allows a faithful reconstruction (bottom).\n    The below video compares alias-free generators\u2019 internal activations to those of StyleGAN2 (top). Our alias-free translation (middle) and rotation (bottom) equivariant networks build the image in a radically different manner from what appear to be multi-scale phase signals that follow the features seen in the final image. Due to our alias-free construction, these signals must control both the appearance of as well as the relative positions of image features; we hypothesize that the local oriented oscillations form a basis that enables hierarchical localization. Our construction appears to make it natural for the network to construct them from the low-frequency input Fourier features.\n          @article{Karras2021, author = {Tero Karras and Miika Aittala and Samuli Laine and Erik H\\&#34;{a}rk\\&#34;{o}nen and Janne Hellsten and Jaakko Lehtinen and Timo Aila}, journal = {CoRR}, title = {Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks}, volume = {abs/2106.xxxxxx}, year = {2021}}\n    Images, text and video files on this site are made freely available for non-commercial use under the   Creative Commons CC BY-NC 4.0 license  .

This is due in large part to their past success in distributed IT development, remote IT operations, and remote maintenance. IT companies have required their staff to essentially do at home what they had been doing in the office years before. Moreover, to meet the constraints of working from home, the demand for IT services has increased across many other market sectors, including retail, entertainment, education, and healthcare, leading to a more profitable IT market.\n    While this news is largely positive for IT companies, the pandemic is also taking its toll on the upstream supply of IT labor, and software developers in particular. These effects could constrain hiring and innovation over the next two to three years. Due in part to travel embargos, limited access to educational loans, and delays in student visa processing, U.S. colleges and universities are observing significant declines in graduate-level enrollments in computer and information science this year. These declines are translating into one-year enrollment deferrals, meaning a temporary, but significant reduction in expected 2021 graduation rates.\n Two years ago, in 2019, U.S. colleges and universities awarded more than 136,000 bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information science (CIS).  6 Among which, 35,200 of these degrees were awarded to nonresident aliens, among whom 27,200 or 77% earned either a master&#39;s or doctoral degree, placing these graduates in a higher skilled technology category. Recently, the American Council on Education (ACE) reported a 43% decline in pandemic-era enrollments for international students based on recent surveys.  5 This decline will reduce CIS post-graduates by 11,700 students in 2021, and would disproportionately affect higher-skilled graduates with more than two years of industry experience. While this story is still playing out, we should already anticipate a tighter IT labor market, particularly among higher-skilled technology jobs.\n    Prior to the pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated that approximately 1,469,200 full-time software developers were working in the U.S. in 2019, earning an average salary of $107,510. Over the next 10 years, BLS estimates the U.S. labor market will add 316,000 software developer jobs, which is a phenomenal 22% growth rate, or an average of about 31,000 new jobs each year. By comparison, lesser-skilled computer programmer jobs would decline by 9% to fewer than 193,800 jobs by 2029, showing a continued shift in the U.S. labor market toward higher-skilled IT jobs that include the engineering practices of software design, software construction and maintenance. The 43% decline in new CIS graduates reported by the ACE would reduce BLS estimated job growth by 38% in 2021 by leaving thousands of jobs unfilled.\n In our review of published 2018 data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), 61% of the top 200 companies that hire graduates under Optional Practical Training (OPT) conduct business in management consulting, and information technology, including retail, finance, and healthcare;  9 see the sidebar  here. This includes popular consulting companies, such as Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and KPMG, as well as popular technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We estimate that in 2018 there were 46,700 new workers authorized under STEM OPT who were potentially working in IT-related fields. If true, then a decline of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021 could reduce the available OPT-authorized IT workforce by as much as 25%.\n    When labor-supply shortages arise in IT, the impact can negatively affect both productivity and innovation. In a survey of electronic and mechanical engineering and IT firms in Northern Ireland, Bennett and McGuinness found that skill shortages in hard-to-fill and unfilled vacancies reduce firm-level performance.  1 Hard-to-fill vacancies include those requiring more experience and qualifications, such as IT positions that require at least two years of experience, which are reported to be 40% more difficult to fill than entry-level positions. Unfilled vacancies are measured by the raw number of open positions within the last 12 months, which is independent of how recruiters interpret &#34;difficult to hire.&#34; In general, Bennett and McGuinness found that hard-to-fill vacancies reduced productivity levels by 65%, while unfilled vacancies reduced productivity levels by 75%. This productivity loss is amplified when the company has a large proportion of new graduates and inexperienced workers, or when the company has significant investments in R&amp;D, which otherwise drives up productivity when labor shortages are minimal. Substantiating the impact of labor shortages on innovation, Horbach and Rammer analyzed three years of the German Innovation Survey and found that unfilled positions in high skill areas correlates with increased canceling of innovation projects.  4\n Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies. What makes a company attractive to a prospective employee is driven in part by the skills that a prospective hire feels they can develop on the new job. Based on an analysis of employment data from over 50,000 workers, Tambe et al. found that IT employees accept a &#34;compensating differential,&#34; such as trading pay for other job attributes, when they can work with novel and emerging IT systems and develop their skills on the job.  7 Furthermore, their analysis shows employees value working on interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes, such as pay and other benefits. They also note that recent graduates who arrived with newer skills in a high-demand job market would have more job options, and thus be more competitive hires.\n    Instead of waiting for positions to become hard-to-fill and unfilled\u2014leading to more lost productivity and reduced innovation\u2014companies can take two strategic steps to attract and retain high-skilled employees: establish a dual career path for managerial and technical staff, and invest in employee education and training.\n In 1988, Ginzburg and Baroudi identified the need to define a non-managerial technical career ladder to complement the traditional management track for promotions.  3 Over the last seven years, we observed that over 50% of graduates of the Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have entered senior positions. These graduates enter either a managerial track, such as Project and Program Manager or Staff Software Engineer, or they enter a technical track, such as Senior Software Engineer and Software Development Engineer II and above. The technical track encourages career growth without shifting one&#39;s responsibilities to primarily cover management activities. In April 2020, we looked at career paths of alumni who graduated from 2015\u20132017 recording 44 alumni who ascended the technical ladder within their companies, and 10 who ascended by changing employers. Companies that allow employees to move between tracks afford employees more flexibility to pursue skill development within the company versus looking outward for open positions elsewhere. For example, we observed CMU MSE alumni working for a few years as technical leaders, building critical service infrastructure, who later chose to develop their personnel and project management skills by moving to a management track. We also see the converse, though less often: after having managed a team for some time, an alumnus/alumna chooses to re-enter a product or project team as a technical leader in a non-management role. In our discussions with alumni, these shifts were not viewed as career compromises, but as skill development opportunities.\n  Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies.\n  Another way to attract and retain employees, and to support internal career advancement, is to engage employees in on-the-job education by providing online learning benefits in addition to pay. One consequence of the pandemic has been large moves by colleges and universities toward online learning. Coursework in artificial intelligence and machine learning, DevOps, and software architecture are now online and taught by the world&#39;s experts in these topics. Online learning opportunities come in different sizes, from one-to three-course certificates to part-time degree programs that students complete over two to three years. In many cases, employees dedicate 10\u201312 hours a week to online courses, while applying this advanced knowledge to their workplace projects. To build such benefits, companies should consider several issues, including: how to allow for flexible schedules that accommodate online classes; how much to compensate employees for course tuition, recognizing these newly learned skills will transfer to their workplace performance; and whether a certificate or a degree program is the right incentive for recruitment and retention. Certificates may be attractive to senior employees, whereas a graduate degree could entice recent hires looking for more experience and seek additional formal education aimed at advancing their careers internally.\n By emphasizing career paths that foster skill development, companies can move to keep employees more engaged with new opportunities that demonstrate their intellect and entrepreneurship. Moreover, providing corporate support for online software engineering education can re-energize a culture of innovation. Together, these investments can help companies reduce their exposure to the effects of this pandemic, while the upstream supply of IT labor replenishes to meet growing demand.\n    It is evident a labor shortage is expected to arrive soon and that it will disproportionately affect highly skilled workers. With an estimated reduction of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021  5 and the BLS estimated 22% growth in software developer jobs,  8 there could be thousands of positions left unfilled or hard-to-fill. The added difficulty of hiring skilled employees from a smaller labor supply has the potential to cost companies through lost productivity and reduced innovation. The remaining question is how will companies creatively hire and retain high-skilled employees amidst all the coming turmoil? Companies can get ahead of the shortfall with two strategic steps: establishing a dual career path that allows employees to grow, and investing in employee education and training.\n  1.
