Now, as the world is figuring out how to slowly reopen for business, I spoke with Facebook&#39;s highest-profile VR advocate again -- this time remotely -- to talk about how his latest VR headset, the    Oculus Quest 2, is doing. In a world of remote work where VR headsets still don&#39;t fit into the picture too much -- just  5.5 million headsets were estimated to be sold last year -- I wanted to hear what Facebook&#39;s CEO thinks will come next.</p><p> 我一年半见面见过Mark Zuckerberg，谈论VR的下一步以及增强现实的可能性，只需几个月的地球进入冠状病毒锁定模式。现在，随着世界上的，弄清楚如何慢慢重新打开业务，我与Facebook谈话了，再次讲述了最高个人资料VR倡导者 - 这次远程 - 谈论他最新的VR耳机，Oculus任务2如何，是在做。在一个遥控器的世界里，VR耳机仍然没有＆＃39; t融入图片太多 - 估计去年只有550万头纪念碑销售 - 我想听听Facebook＆＃39;首席执行官的想法下一个。</p><p>  Zuckerberg says that the Oculus Quest&#39;s greatest strength against its competition is its convenient wire-free experience, and that bringing the price down from the original $399 to $299 in October was a strategic move, intended to get more people to embrace VR. But Zuckerberg says he wants to upgrade the VR experience even more with the Quest Pro, a device that could include new sensors -- face and eye tracking or maybe even fitness -- in a higher-end self-contained system. The new sensors could add a greater sense of &#34;presence&#34; as part of Facebook&#39;s plan for social VR. It could also come at a higher price, as Zuckerberg says, &#34;there&#39;s some ability for it to be a little more expensive.&#34;</p><p>  扎克伯格说，Oculus Quest＆＃39;最大的竞争力量是它的竞争方面的巨大优势是它的便捷经验，从10月份从原来的价格399美元到299美元的价格是一个战略举动，旨在让更多人接受VR 。但Zuckerberg表示，他希望用Quest Pro升级更多的VR体验，该设备可以包括新传感器 - 面部和眼睛跟踪或甚至适合 - 在高端的自包含系统中。新传感器可以增加更大的＆＃34;存在＆＃34;作为Facebook的一部分，社交VR计划。由于扎克伯格说，＆＃34;有一些能力，它也可以处于更高的价格。＆＃34;</p><p> But the overall goal for Facebook right now, Zuckerberg told me, is to widen adoption so the world&#39;s largest social media network can create more social opportunities for engaging in a virtual world. And he&#39;s willing to lose money to win over people.</p><p> 但是Facebook的整体目标现在，Zuckerberg告诉我，是为了拓宽采用，所以世界＆＃39;最大的社交媒体网络可以为参与虚拟世界创造更多的社交机会。他愿意忘记赢得人民的钱。</p><p> &#34;We&#39;re not approaching this from the perspective of, how do we charge people as much money as possible and make profit on the devices?&#34; Zuckerberg said in our 30-minute conversation. &#34;What we saw was virtual reality is really about this sense of presence and therefore, it&#39;s about social connection, more than it&#39;s about whatever the technology is.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们从角度来看，我们没有如何将众多收取人数尽可能多的钱，并在设备上赚取利润？＆＃34;扎克伯格在我们30分钟的谈话中说。 ＆＃34;我们所看到的是虚拟现实真的是关于这种存在感，因此，关于社会联系，而不是它的存在。＆＃34;</p><p>  For Zuckerberg, this isn&#39;t about resolution or processor speed. It&#39;s about creating an immersive world to fall into.</p><p>  对于Zuckerberg，这是一个关于分辨率或处理器速度的ISN＆＃39;它是关于创造一个沉重的世界陷入困境的＆＃39;</p><p> &#34;We want to get as many people as possible to be able to experience virtual reality and be able to jump into the metaverse and … to have these social experiences within that,&#34; he adds. &#34;That&#39;s really where our bread and butter as a company is in terms of building those experiences. That&#39;s also what our business is.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们希望获得尽可能多的人能够体验虚拟现实，并能够跳进成权和......以便在那里拥有这些社会体验，＆＃34;他补充道。 ＆＃34;那个＆＃39;真正在我们的面包和黄油作为公司的地方，是建立这些经历。那些＆＃39;也是我们的业务。＆＃34; </p><p> Facebook is getting closer to launching this world in the form of a large-scale social metaverse called    Facebook Horizon that, with creative tools and user-created worlds, looks reminiscent of apps like AltspaceVR, Rec Room, and maybe even  Fortnite,    Roblox and    Minecraft. Zuckerberg calls Horizon a &#34;very big priority&#34; for Facebook, something that will &#34;play a big role toward helping to build out this broader metaverse that will go across all of virtual and augmented reality.&#34; It&#39;s an approach that feels    similar to Microsoft&#39;s.</p><p>Facebook正在以大规模的社交成交形式推出这个世界，称为Facebook Horizo​​ n，与创意工具和用户创作的世界，看起来让人想起Altspacevr，REC室，甚至是Fortnite，Roblox和Minecraft 。 Zuckerberg称Horizo​​ n A＆＃34;非常大的优先级＆＃34;对于Facebook，一些意志＆＃34;在帮助建造这种更广泛的偏远的地方发挥重要作用，这将跨越所有虚拟和增强现实。＆＃34;它＆＃39;是一种感觉与微软的方法。</p><p> Zuckerberg plans for Facebook&#39;s employees, who will be able to work remotely in our new postpandemic, hybrid workplaces, to start testing Horizon. He says it&#39;s an important &#34;dogfooding&#34; step for developing the platform more as it nears public launch sometime in the as-yet-to-be-determined future.</p><p> Zuckerberg计划Facebook＆＃39;员工，员工将能够在我们的新后期性混合工作场所远程工作，以开始测试地平线。他说它＆＃39;这是一个重要的＆＃34;狗狗食品＆＃34;在迄今为止的未来的某个时间接近公开发布时，更多地开发平台的步骤。</p><p> Tellingly, we didn&#39;t speak over VR or even over Zoom video, instead opting for a Zoom audio call. Zuckerberg says he doesn&#39;t find Zoom meetings memorable or compelling. &#34;I find that when I&#39;m on a bunch of video calls, they all kind of blend together and I have a hard time remembering exactly which call something was said on or it&#39;s just kind of harder to place it because there&#39;s no real sense of space,&#34; he notes. And though he admits that videoconferencing has its positives today -- including higher video quality than you get in VR right now -- he&#39;s also confident that people will see the benefits of VR.</p><p> 讲述，我们在vr甚至在缩放视频中讲了＆＃39;它甚至在缩放视频上讲，而是选择缩放音频呼叫。扎克伯格说，他没有找到令人难忘或引人注目的放大会议。 ＆＃34;我发现当我在一堆视频通话时，他们一直混合在一起，我很难记住，究竟叫什么叫做什么，＆＃39;只要努力因为那里而不是真正的空间感，＆＃34;他指出了。虽然他承认视频会议今天有其积极态度 - 包括比现在在VR的视频质量更高 - 他也相信人们会看到VR的好处。</p><p> &#34;There are a lot of advantages to the presence that you get in virtual reality compared to the other modes of communication that we have. If we&#39;re already there with the fidelity of experiences that are possible today, to me that just says, wow, in five years this is going to be clearly better on almost all of these fronts for a lot of the things that we do.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;与我们所拥有的其他通信模式相比，在虚拟现实中存在很多优势。如果我们＆＃39;在今天有可能的经验的忠诚度上，对我来说，哇，五年来，这几乎所有这些方面都会显着更好做。＆＃34;</p><p> That VR future, however, still isn&#39;t designed for kids, despite a growing number of children I know using the Oculus Quest at home. Zuckerberg doesn&#39;t see a kid mode for Oculus VR being in the works anytime soon, either, but admits a large interest in VR for education overall.</p><p> 然而，VR未来仍然是为孩子们设计的，尽管我知道在家里的oculus任务越来越多的孩子们，但是越来越多的孩子。 Zuckerberg并不很快看到Oculus VR的孩子模式，也很快进入了工作中的大量兴趣。</p><p> Facebook is also working on    more advanced AR glasses with    wrist-worn neural interfaces, but that may still be many years away. Before that, an Oculus Quest Pro could bring more advanced sensors into Facebook&#39;s VR ecosystem first. We also talked about the possibilities for what a step-up Oculus Quest Pro could bring next and what VR apps Zuckerberg spends time with at home. Below is our conversation, lightly edited for clarity.</p><p> Facebook还在使用带有手腕磨损的神经界面的更先进的AR眼镜，但可能仍有很多年的距离。在此之前，Oculus Quest Pro首先可以将更多高级传感器带入Facebook＆＃39; S VR生态系统。我们还讨论了升级Oculus Quest Pro可以带来什么的可能性，以及VR应用程序Zuckerberg在家中花费时间。下面是我们的谈话，因为清晰而轻微编辑。</p><p>  It&#39;s been five years since the Oculus Rift came out. Where do you see VR and AR tech for you now versus what it was even in 2019? Are things significantly changed? Or are there things that you wish were here but still aren&#39;t?</p><p>  它＆＃39已经五年以来，自影像裂痕出来。您现在在哪里看到VR和AR技术与2019年甚至是什么？事情是否显着改变？或者是你想要的东西在这里，但仍然是aren＆＃39; t？ </p><p> It&#39;s an incredibly exciting time for this. It&#39;s pretty amazing to see how a lot of the aspects of the original vision, and what we hoped would play out here, are starting to fall into place. You know, it&#39;s still a long-term journey. There&#39;s still a ton that needs to get done over the next five-plus years to really deliver all the experiences that we want. But there are a lot of awesome pieces that are coming into place. And I&#39;m excited to get a chance to talk about those today.</p><p>它＆＃39;这是一个令人难以置信的令人兴奋的时间。它＆＃39非常惊人，看看原始愿景的众多方面如何，以及我们希望在这里发挥作用，开始落到它的地方。你知道，它仍然是一个长期的旅​​程。仍然是一个需要在接下来的五年内完成完成的吨，以确保我们想要的所有经验。但是有很多很棒的作品即将到来。和我很高兴有机会谈论今天的机会。</p><p> At the same time, you&#39;re right that with the pandemic and more people shifting toward being more remote more of the time, that&#39;s just put even more importance on building technologies that give us a sense of presence, and that help us feel like we&#39;re together and really get to connect naturally, whether that&#39;s socially or professionally or for entertainment and playing games. That&#39;s always been the promise of virtual and augmented reality. Unlike every other computing platform and type of screen that we&#39;ve had to date, these platforms give you a sense of presence, like you&#39;re right there with another person or in another place. That&#39;s pretty magical. Every other communication tool that we&#39;ve built up to this point is trying to approximate that, but virtual and augmented reality are the first ones that really deliver that sense of presence. And I know that is going to be increasingly important as the world, I imagine, will stay more remote as we come out of the pandemic.</p><p> 与此同时，你＆＃39;与大流行，更多的人往往更多的人更多的时间，即在建筑技术上甚至更加重要，这给我们带来了存在的存在这有助于我们觉得我们一起＆＃39;重新加入，真正能够自然地连接，无论是＆＃39;社交还是专业或娱乐和玩游戏。 ＆＃39;始终是虚拟和增强现实的承诺。与我们迄今为止的每个其他计算平台和屏幕类型不同，这些平台为您提供了一种存在的存在感，就像你和另一个人或在另一个地方就一样。那个＆＃39;非常神奇。我们建立在这一点的每个其他通信工具正在尝试近似，但虚拟和增强现实是真正提供这种存在感的第一个。而且我知道这将是世界上的越来越重要，我想，当我们走出大流行时会保持更加偏远。</p><p> You mentioned presence, and I think a lot about social [uses]. At the same time, I talk to some people and they don&#39;t have any VR headsets. Other people I know are starting to actually buy them. I was curious where you see that right now. You don&#39;t specifically mention sales numbers, but you&#39;ve mentioned sales coming along, but not necessarily being as big as the Nintendo Switch. Do you think VR has achieved that social level you wanted?</p><p> 你提到了存在，我认为很多关于社交[用途]。与此同时，我和一些人交谈，他们没有任何VR耳机。我所知道的其他人开始实际购买它们。你现在看到的好奇心。你不具体提到销售数字，但是你提到的销售额，但不一定像任天堂交换机一样大。您认为VR是否已达到您想要的社会层面？</p><p> We&#39;re in the second generation of Quest now, and what I can say is that Quest 2 is doing quite well. It&#39;s meaningfully outperforming even what we&#39;d hoped for it. So that&#39;s great. The Quest was where we really cracked the form factor and got it to be a wireless device that can do high-quality experiences. When you&#39;re talking about virtual reality, in the sense of presence, there really is something that&#39;s incredibly important about it being wireless. If you [have a] wire that&#39;s wrapped around your neck or draped over your shoulder and it&#39;s touching you, it really just breaks the whole illusion and sense of presence. It&#39;s a big step forward in terms of quality of the experience, and it requires a lot of innovation to achieve that. What we&#39;ve seen is that a lot of the other folks in the space haven&#39;t been able to deliver that wireless experience yet, and I think that will likely continue to hold back some of those products.</p><p> 我们现在在第二代任务中，我可以说的是，任务2做得很好。它＆＃39;也有意义地表现出我们的希望。所以＆＃39;很棒。任务是我们真正破解了表单因素的地方，并使其成为一种可以进行高质量体验的无线设备。当你谈论虚拟现实时，在存在的情况下，真的有些东西＆＃39;它对它是无线的非常重要。如果你[有一个]＆＃39; s缠绕在脖子上或覆盖在你的肩膀上，它触摸了你，它真的只是打破了整个幻觉和存在感。它＆＃39;在经验的质量方面向前迈出了一大步，它需要很多创新来实现这一目标。我们所看到的是，太空的很多其他人都有很多人在空间里＆＃39;它还能够提供这种无线经验，我认为这可能会继续遏制其中一些产品。</p><p> But we had the first-generation Quest, we improved on it with Quest 2. That&#39;s going quite well. So what I look at is the trajectory of how these things are going, how is the next version after that going to go, and the next version after that. We have really exciting products in the road map for down the line that I just think are going to be really awesome. But you know, Quest 2 has been an inflection point for the adoption around this.</p><p> 但我们有第一代的任务，我们用Quest 2改进了它。那个＆＃39;跳得很好。所以我看的是这些事情如何运作的轨迹，下一个版本在那里的下一个版本以及下一个版本之后。我们在路线图中有真正令人兴奋的产品，以便在线地图下，我只是认为会真的很棒。但是你知道，Quest 2一直是通过它采用的拐点。</p><p> You mentioned some of the road map. And recently I heard a chat mentioning the existence of a Quest Pro. Is that something that would be for business? Or do you imagine there being possibly different levels of interest at different tiers for what the Oculus Quest could be?</p><p> 你提到了一些路线图。最近我听说聊天提到了Quest Pro的存在。这是商业的东西吗？或者你想象在不同层对Oculus Quest可能是什么不同层次的兴趣？</p><p> This is certainly something that we&#39;re working on. Basically, having a higher-end virtual reality experience. Traditionally, if you wanted to get a virtual reality device that had more power, the thing that you did was you wired [it] into a PC or some other computer, that&#39;s one way to do it. But I think the trade-off on requiring the wire is too great in terms of the experience ... what you trade off on immersion and being able to walk around -- even if you&#39;re sitting at a desk and doing productivity work. I don&#39;t think you want that wire basically breaking the sense of presence. So even for Quest 2, we focused a lot on    AirLink, which we just released. It&#39;s the ability to now stream games from your PC, so you can take advantage of the power of the PC and still have a wireless experience, which is really important.</p><p> 这肯定是我们＆＃39;重申的东西。基本上，具有高端的虚拟现实体验。传统上，如果你想获得一个有更多电力的虚拟现实设备，你所做的事情是你有线[它]进入一个电脑或一些其他电脑，那个方法是这样做的。但我认为要求电线的权衡在经验方面太大了......你在沉浸在沉浸并能够走路时，即使你坐在一张桌子上并做生产力工作。我认为你想要那条电线基本上打破了存在感。所以即使是为了任务2，我们也集中了很多关于我们刚刚发布的空中链路。它＆＃39;现在可以从PC流出游戏的能力，因此您可以利用PC的电源，仍然具有无线体验，这非常重要。 </p><p> But there are other aspects that make virtual reality a higher-end experience as well, including putting more power in it in terms of different types of sensors and capabilities on the device. We do want to be able to support a wider range of use cases. I mean, it&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s been quite exciting with Quest 2 -- seeing it broadened out. It&#39;s still primarily gaming. But we&#39;re starting to see the top few apps are social apps where people hang out together. We&#39;re starting to see an increase in apps for creative production or productivity or people getting together to work. One of the things I&#39;ve been pretty excited to see is this growth of    fitness apps. So you see apps like    FitXR and    Supernatural, which are basically subscription services where you can take different classes doing boxing or dancing or different things. It&#39;s almost like Peloton. It&#39;s just kind of as easy to jump into, and you&#39;re paying a subscription. Now you can do your workouts that way.</p><p>但是还有其他方面使虚拟现实成为高端经验，包括在设备上的不同类型的传感器和能力方面放入更多的电力。我们确实希望能够支持更广泛的用例。我的意思是，它＆＃39;＆＃39;＆＃39; S一直令人兴奋的任务2  - 看到它扩大了。它仍然主要是游戏＆＃39;但是，我们开始看到顶级的应用程序是人们一起出去玩的社交应用程序。我们开始看到创造性生产或生产力的应用程序增加，或者共同努力工作。我＆＃39的一件事很兴奋，看起来是健身应用的这种增长。因此，您可以看到像Fitxr和超自然这样的应用程序，这是基本上订阅服务，在那里您可以采取不同的课程进行拳击或跳舞或不同的东西。它＆＃39;几乎像peloton。它只是易于跳进，你＆＃39;重申订阅。现在你可以这样做锻炼。</p><p> From my perspective, it&#39;s filling out the initial vision and hope that we had for VR about how there are going to be all these different use cases. It&#39;s amazing for gaming, but it&#39;s not only for gaming. Part of the question is if you were focused on building a higher-end device that could really max out further on some of those other use cases, in addition to doing the gaming pieces, there are some interesting questions about how you design. Now it&#39;s not coming out anytime soon, but that&#39;s certainly something that we&#39;re excited about and having different products that basically can serve different use cases really well.</p><p> 从我的角度来看，它填写了初步愿景，并希望我们对VR有关所有这些不同用例的愿景。它＆＃39;对于游戏而言，但它不仅适用于游戏。部分问题是，如果您专注于构建一个更高的设备，这些设备可以在一些其他用例中进一步突出，除了做游戏件之外，还有一些关于您设计的有趣问题。现在它不会很快出来，但是那些＆＃39;肯定是我们＆＃39;再次兴奋和拥有不同的产品，基本上可以很好地为不同用例提供服务。</p><p>  You mentioned fitness: It&#39;s an area I definitely want to talk to you about because I&#39;ve been using my [Quest 2] more for that. I see that it&#39;s being positioned for that. I saw an ad in the New York Times talking about it as a fitness device, and I believe Facebook as a company is allowing expensing of it as a health and wellness device. Do you use it for fitness yourself?</p><p>  你提到了健身：它＆＃39;我肯定想和你谈论的区域，因为我一直在使用我的[任务2]更多。我认为它是它的定位＆＃39。我在纽约时报看到了一个广告，谈到它作为一个健身装置，我认为Facebook作为一家公司，允许将其降为健康和健康设备。你自己用它来健身吗？</p><p> I use all these different apps. I love Beat Saber. That&#39;s one of my favorite things on Quest. I&#39;ve certainly enjoyed FitXR as well. And I&#39;m a big runner. So we don&#39;t quite have that in VR yet. I am also a surfer and a foiler. I really want us to get a good experience where you can basically do the pumping part in VR, but we don&#39;t quite have that yet. But I think in all these things, doing Beat Saber or FitXR or Supernatural, they&#39;re real workouts. If I&#39;m in Beat Saber, especially if I&#39;m competing with one of my friends for half an hour or an hour, you definitely work up a sweat. You get tired by the end of that. So it&#39;s pretty active. And I think it&#39;s pretty clear why people really like it.</p><p> 我使用所有这些不同的应用程序。我喜欢击败军刀。那个＆＃39;我最喜欢的任务之一。我＆＃39肯定也喜欢FitXr。和我是一个大跑步者。所以我们在vr中没有。我也是一个冲浪者和一个挫败机。我真的希望我们获得一个良好的体验，在你可以在VR中基本上做泵送部分，但我们还有很多。但我认为在所有这些事情中，做了击败刀剑或fitxr或超自然，他们＆＃39;重新真正的锻炼。如果我在击败军刀中，特别是如果我和我的一个朋友竞争了半个小时或一小时的话，你肯定会出汗。你已经累了。所以它＆＃39;很活跃。我认为它很清楚为什么人们真的喜欢它。</p><p> Do you set up a space in your home that&#39;s a dedicated VR zone where you do these things, and is there any time of day where you might do workouts with this?</p><p> 您是否在家中设置了一个空间，＆＃39; s一个专用的VR区域，在那里你做这些东西，在那里有哪些时间，你可能会用这个锻炼？</p><p> One of the things about Quest, and it being wireless and stand-alone, is it is really portable, to be able to do it anywhere. So I have [it] in our living room and in our basement. To be honest, sometimes I&#39;ll kind of go down there and there&#39;s sort of bigger open spaces. But I&#39;ll even just do it in our bedroom, where I probably have a more traditional, not particularly huge space to do it, but definitely enough. But again, I think this gets down to the form factor question. At the time we were getting into the experience, you had to be tethered to a desk or tethered to the same room as where your gaming PC was. [That] was just a bit more limiting for people and getting it to be more free-flowing is a very big advance in terms of letting people try it on in different places, making it easier to jump in.</p><p> 关于Quest的一件事，它是无线和独立的，它是真正的便携式，能够在任何地方做到。所以我有[它]在我们的客厅和地下室。说实话，有时候我会在那里和＃39;那种越来越大的开放空间。但是我＆＃39;甚至在我们的卧室里做到了，我可能有更传统的，而不是特别巨大的空间，但绝对足够。但是，我认为这会达到形式因素问题。当我们进入经验时，你必须被束缚在一张桌子上或束缚在与游戏PC所在的同一个房间。 [那]对人来说，让它更加限制，让它更自由流动是一个非常大的提前，让人们在不同的地方尝试它，使得更容易进入。</p><p> That&#39;s a big part of what we&#39;re seeing here, and why we&#39;re so dedicated to wireless as the form factor. All the things that we&#39;re going to focus on, including the future Quest Pro work that we&#39;re thinking about, that&#39;s just going to be a killer part of it.</p><p> 这是我们在这里看到的一部分的大部分，以及为什么我们＆＃39;重新致力于无线形式因素。我们＆＃39的所有事情;重新关注，包括未来的Quest Pro工作我们＆＃39;重新考虑，那个＆＃39;＆＃39;只是一个杀手部分。 </p><p> You also asked about routines. I have this one group of a bunch of my friends on a Messenger group thread. And it&#39;s like our metaverse thread. Every weekend or so, someone pings the thread and is like, &#39;Hey, do you want to play Onward?&#39; Or, &#39;Do you want to play Population: One? Or do you want to play Arizona Sunshine?&#39; Those are a bunch of my favorite multiplayer games. That&#39;s probably the closest thing that I have to a real ritual around this -- kind of getting together with friends and going to do this. Over the last year, especially during the pandemic, when I couldn&#39;t see a lot of these people in person, it was just really a neat thing to be able to do. [It] really drove home for me the value of being able to have those kinds of social and gaming experiences together.</p><p>您还询问了例程。我在Messenger Group帖子上有这一群一群朋友。它和＃39;像我们的偏执。每个周末左右，有人张望线，就像，＆＃39;嘿，你想跟上吗？＆＃39;或者，＆＃39;你想玩人口吗？或者你想玩亚利桑那阳光吗？＆＃39;那些是我最喜欢的多人游戏的一堆。那个＆＃39;我可能是最接近的事情，我必须对此的真实仪式 - 有点和朋友一起去，然后这样做。在去年，特别是在大流行期间，当我能够亲自看到很多这些人时，它真的可以做到这一点。 [它]真正为我带回家，能够将这些社会和游戏体验的价值在一起。</p><p> I&#39;m sort of getting into the same when you mentioned fitness. You mentioned sensors... it raises the question for me, do you think that there&#39;s a chance of these fitness apps working more with watches and trackers? I know you&#39;re working on wrist tech for neural inputs and AR. Does that open doorways for VR? And are you looking at more of a wellness direction for what fitness can do?</p><p> 当你提到健身时，我有点进入相同。你提到了传感器......它对我提出了这个问题，你认为有些健身应用程序的机会与手表和跟踪器一起工作吗？我认识你＆＃39;重新努力为神经投入和ar工作的腕力技术。那个开放的门口是否适用于VR？你是在看着健身可以做的更多的健康方向吗？</p><p> These are all really interesting questions. We are certainly working on the neural interfaces part and the wrist interface around that. Our hope is that eventually that works across virtual and augmented reality, and will be valuable across all these things.</p><p> 这些都是非常有趣的问题。我们肯定正在研究神经接口部分和周围的手腕界面。我们的希望最终跨越虚拟和增强现实工作，并且对所有这些事情都有价值。</p><p> Getting back to your question around Quest Pro, there are a lot of sensors that would add different senses to the overall experience. We&#39;ve talked a bit about things like eye tracking and face tracking, and you&#39;re talking now about things like different health sensors, whether that&#39;s heart rate monitoring or the different other kinds of fitness sensors that you might have on a fitness watch. The basic thing that these all have in common is that each of them takes additional compute power to power the thing. And the whole device needs to be tuned for that. So if you want to basically have a device over time that is just capable of all these things and is running an increasing number of sensors, you need to kind of get to higher- and higher-end devices. And then the question for us is going to be, well, how do we innovate on what that&#39;s going to look like and be able to deliver something that&#39;s a high-end product?</p><p> 追溯到Quest Pro周围的问题，有很多传感器会为整体体验增加不同的感官。我们＆＃39;谈到了一些关于眼踪和面部跟踪的东西，你＆＃39;现在对不同的健康传感器进行了谈话，无论是与不同的健康传感器一样的东西，是否心率监测或不同的其他种类的健身传感器你可能有健身手表。这些都是共同之处的基本事情是，每个人都需要额外的计算能力来为这件事供电。并且整个设备需要进行调整。因此，如果您希望随着时间的推移基本上有一个设备，并且正在运行越来越多的传感器，则需要进入更高的设备。然后我们的问题将是，我们如何创新它的形式和＃39; s的看起来像是能够提供的东西＆＃39; s高端产品？</p><p> And then also, how do we get it to be something that is really affordable for a very wide number of people, because our mission as a company is really to help connect everyone, right?</p><p> 然后，我们如何让它成为一个非常适用于一大群人的东西，因为我们作为公司的使命实际上是帮助每个人的帮助？</p><p> Our approach to VR, is, rather than building a device and trying to sell it at a premium and make a bunch of money on the device, what we want to do is build a great experience and make it so that as many people as possible can experience this and can be part of this metaverse. And at the end of the day, we build experiences that are part of that and that will be the long-term business that we do. So I think the innovation on the sensor side, the compute side, to make sure that we can build devices that power these both at the high end, and devices that can be broadly available to everyone, that&#39;s a big part of what we&#39;re focused on over the next five years.</p><p> 我们对VR的方法，而不是建立一个设备并试图在溢价上销售它，并在设备上制作一堆金钱，我们想要做的是建立一个伟大的体验，使其成为尽可能多的人可以体验这一点，可以成为这种成权的一部分。在一天结束时，我们建立了一部分的经验，这将是我们所做的长期业务。所以我认为传感器侧的创新，计算侧，以确保我们可以在高端和可广泛可用的设备上建立电源的设备，即＆＃39;什么是什么我们＆＃39;重点关注未来五年。</p><p> It sounds like affordability is a big part of that too, when you mentioned not climbing too high in price. Already the Quest 2 is reduced in price (from $399 to $299 today) and it&#39;s gotten to a point where it&#39;s game console-level, which is not something that other companies have been able to hit yet.</p><p> 这听起来像负担能力也是一个很大的一部分，当你提到没有攀爬的价格太高时也是如此。 Quest 2已经减少了价格（从今天的399美元到299美元），它得到了它的一点＆＃39;游戏机级别，这不是其他公司尚未达到的东西。 </p><p> That&#39;s right. I mean, getting to $299 on Quest 2 was a really big deal. That&#39;s something we wanted to get to, the team worked really hard on that. I&#39;m really proud of them. They did a lot of really hard work to be able to achieve that. And we wanted to see how that would affect accessibility for it. That&#39;s been pretty good in terms of the results that we&#39;ve seen there. But as you mentioned, at this point, even game consoles are more expensive than that. So I think there&#39;s some ability for it to be a little more expensive.</p><p>那个＆＃39;右。我的意思是，追求299美元是一个非常大的交易。那个我们想要到达的东西，团队对此工作非常努力。我为他们感到骄傲。他们做了很多真正的努力工作能够实现这一点。我们希望了解其如何影响它的可访问性。这与我们在那里看到的结果方面非常擅长。但正如你所说，此时，即使是游戏机也比这更昂贵。所以我认为有一些能力且有点贵。</p><p> But our bottom line on this is: We&#39;re not approaching this from the perspective of, how do we charge people as much money as possible and make profit on the devices? We want to get as many people as possible to be able to experience virtual reality and be able to jump into the metaverse and then be able to have these social experiences within that. Then that&#39;s really where where our bread and butter as a company is in terms of building those experiences. That&#39;s also what our business is.</p><p> 但是我们的底线是：我们从角度来看，我们没有接近这一点，我们如何尽可能多地将人收取多少钱并在设备上赚取利润？我们希望尽可能多地获得尽可能体验虚拟现实，并能够跳进偏见，然后能够在那里拥有这些社会体验。然后那个＆＃39;真的在哪里在我们的面包和黄油作为公司的地方，这是建立这些经历。那也是我们的业务的＆＃39;</p><p> Speaking of social, you just launched a revamped version of social avatars. [Facebook] Horizon, which seems like Facebook&#39;s metaverse, keeps approaching. Have you been spending time inside [Horizon]? I&#39;ve had two demos in Horizon over the past couple of years. But I was curious if you&#39;re spending time in there and whether that might be heading toward a launch?</p><p> 说到社交，你刚刚推出了一个改进的社会头像版。 [Facebook] Horizo​​ n，它看起来像Facebook＆＃39; SECAVESSE，保持接近。你有没有在[地平线]里面的时间？在过去的几年里，我在地平线上有两次演示。但是，如果你在那里度过时间以及那可能朝着发射开始时，我很奇怪？</p><p> Yeah, this is a big project for us because there needs to be a social fabric that goes across all of the different layers of virtual reality. That&#39;s what we hope to do with Horizon. So part of it is we&#39;re building this environment where individual creators can create worlds and you can hang out with your friends. Part of it is, we&#39;re building out this avatar system that is going to get increasingly expressive on the one hand, and then if you want, also increasingly realistic. Although I think not everyone wants to be exactly realistic all the time, so you want to kind of offer both expressive and realistic.</p><p> 是的，这是我们的一个大项目，因为需要一个社会面料，跨越所有不同的虚拟现实层。那个＆＃39;我们希望与地平线有所作为。所以它的一部分是我们＆＃39;重新建立这个环境，个人创造者可以创造世界，你可以和你的朋友一起出去玩。其中的一部分是，我们＆＃39;重新建立了这款化身系统，该系统一方面会越来越富有表现力，然后如果你想要的话，也越来越地逼真。虽然我认为不是每个人都想要一直都是逼真的，所以你想要提供表现力和现实的。</p><p> There are all these different services in this. But basically, that&#39;s a big part of what we want</p><p> 这是所有这些不同的服务。但基本上，那个＆＃39;我们想要什么的重要组成部分</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/features/mark-zuckerberg-explains-where-vr-goes-next-quest-pro-fitness-and-a-facebook-powered-metaverse/">https://www.cnet.com/features/mark-zuckerberg-explains-where-vr-goes-next-quest-pro-fitness-and-a-facebook-powered-metaverse/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facebook/">#facebook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/vr/">#vr</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
