You can&#39;t make this stuff up.</p><p>这是最令人难以置信的演示I＆＃39;在开源世界中提供的故事。你可以＆＃39; t做到这件事。</p><p> It was 2005, and I felt like I was in the eye of a hurricane. I was an independent performance consultant and Sun Microsystems had just released DTrace, a tool that could instrument all software. This gave performance analysts like myself X-ray vision. While I was busy writing and publishing advanced performance tools using DTrace (my open source  DTraceToolkit and other  DTrace tools, aka scripts), I noticed something odd: I was producing more DTrace tools than were coming out of Sun itself. Perhaps there was some internal project that was consuming all their DTrace expertise?</p><p> 这是2005年，我觉得我是飓风的眼睛。我是一个独立的绩效顾问，Sun Microsystems刚刚发布了DTrace，这是一个可以介绍所有软件的工具。这给了像我自己X射线愿景的性能分析师。虽然我正忙于使用DTrace写作和发布高级性能工具（我的开源DTRARATOOLKIT和其他DTRACE工具，AKA脚本），但我注意到了一些奇怪的东西：我正在生产更多的DTRACE工具，而不是从太阳脱离了。也许有一些内部项目，消耗了他们所有的DTRACE专业知识？</p><p>  As I wasn&#39;t a Sun Microsystems employee I wasn&#39;t privy to Sun&#39;s internal projects. However, I was doing training and consulting for Sun, helping their customers with system administration and performance. Sun sometimes invited me to their own customer meetings and other events I might be interested in, as a local expert. I was living in Sydney, Australia.</p><p>  正如我andn＆＃39; t一个sun microsystems员工，我没有阳光＆＃39;内部项目。但是，我正在为Sun进行培训和咨询，帮助他们的客户提供系统管理和表现。 Sun有时邀请我到自己的客户会议和我可能感兴趣的其他活动，作为当地专家。我住在澳大利亚悉尼。</p><p> This time I was told that there was a Very Important Person visiting from the US whom I&#39;d want to meet. I didn&#39;t recognize the name, but was told that he was a DTrace expert and developer at Sun, and was on a world tour demonstrating Sun&#39;s new DTrace-based product. Ah-hah – this must be the internal project!</p><p> 这次我被告知，来自美国的美国有一个非常重要的人，我想见面。我没有认可这个名字，但被告知他是在太阳的DTrace专家和开发人员，并在世界巡回演出中展示了Sun＆＃39;基于新的DTrace的产品。 Ah-Hah  - 这必须是内部项目！</p><p> But this would be no ordinary project. I&#39;d seen some amazing technologies from Sun, but I&#39;d never seen a developer on a world tour. This was going to be big, and would likely blow away my earlier DTrace work.</p><p> 但这将是没有普通项目。我看过来自太阳的一些惊人的技术，但我从未见过世界巡演的开发商。这将是很大的，并且可能会吹走我之前的DTrace工作。</p><p> The VIP was returning to Sydney for a few days before going to the next Australian city, so we agreed to meet at the Sun Sydney office.</p><p> 在去下一个澳大利亚城市之前，VIP正在返回悉尼，所以我们同意在悉尼办事处举行会面。</p><p>  The DTrace expert arrived wearing casual business attire and a heavy American accent, and seemed a bit weary from his world tour. He had just been to South Africa and New Zealand, and listed other countries and cities he was heading to next. Two other Australian Sun staff joined the meeting, and one introduced me with:</p><p>  DTRACE专家抵达休闲商业服装和沉重的美国口音，似乎有点疲惫地借着他的世界之旅。他刚刚去了南非和新西兰，并列出了他往下接下来的其他国家和城市。另外两名澳大利亚Sun员工加入了会议，一个人介绍了我： </p><p>  Low-key introductions are the norm in Australia (especially for Australians) and I wondered whether he knew of this cultural difference. Another difference was that there were few roles in Australia for engineers in 2005, unlike the US. The Sun Microsystems Australia jobs, for example, were all in support and none in development, and other tech giants had not yet arrived. So back then in Australia you could find amazing engineers doing whatever roles were available.</p><p>低调介绍是澳大利亚（特别是澳大利亚人）的常态，我想知道他是否知道这种文化差异。另一个不同之处在于，与美国不同，澳大利亚在澳大利亚的角色很少。例如，Sun Microsystems澳大利亚所有的工作都是支持，没有发展，其他科技巨头尚未到达。所以回到澳大利亚你可以找到令人惊叹的工程师，做任何角色。</p><p> I tried to expand on the &#34;stuff&#34; a bit by saying that I’d written the DTraceToolkit, but he wasn&#39;t impressed. He didn&#39;t recognize my name, nor had he heard of the DTraceToolkit. To him, I was just some random guy.</p><p> 我试图在＆＃34上扩展;东西＆＃34;一点地说我写了dtracetoolkit，但他留下了＆＃39;令人印象深刻。他没有认可我的名字，也没有听说过DTrARetoolkit。对他来说，我只是一个随机的家伙。</p><p> He was kind enough to give me a quick demo anyway. His DTrace product was an add-on for a larger Sun GUI that I was already familiar with. After it loaded, he showed how you could run one of several DTrace tools by double clicking an icon. Either the raw output would be printed in a separate window, or the results would be shown as a line graph. This seemed  quite underwhelming. The GUI already had this functionality: Showing the raw output of tools or drawing a line graph. I was hoping for a new GUI feature.</p><p> 无论如何，他很友好给我一个快速的演示。他的DTRACE产品是我已经熟悉的更大阳光的加载项。加载后，他展示了如何通过双击图标来运行几个DTrace工具之一。原始输出将打印在单独的窗口中，或者结果将显示为线图。这似乎非常强大。 GUI已经具有此功能：显示工具的原始输出或绘制行图。我希望有一个新的GUI功能。</p><p> The only new work was the tools themselves, of which there were several. He gave a quick sales pitch about the new and amazing observability they provided, something he must have said many times to impress customers. I got the feeling he wasn&#39;t expecting me to properly appreciate their value.</p><p> 唯一的新工作是工具本身，其中有几个。他提供了快速的销售促销，了解他们提供的新的和惊人的可观察性，他必须曾多次给客户留下深刻印象。我感觉到他是and＃39;期待我妥善欣赏他们的价值。</p><p> But I  did understand these tools, since I had coded similar functionality for my own DTraceToolkit. They were useful, but...I was expecting a hurricane of awesome  new DTrace content.</p><p> 但我确实了解这些工具，因为我为自己的DTrAcetoolkit编写了类似的功能。它们很有用，但......我期待飓风的令人敬畏的新DTrace内容。</p><p>  &#34;Yeah, sure.&#34; He didn’t quite say it, but gave me a look like he didn&#39;t really believe me, or that I could even truly understand what they were. This was an important innovation by Sun Microsystems, a US-based multinational company worth billions. I was just some random Aussie.</p><p>  ＆＃34;是的，肯定。＆＃34;他并没有说它，但给了我一个看起来像他没有真正相信我，或者我甚至可以真正了解他们是什么。这是Sun Microsystems的重要创新，这是一个值得数十亿美元的跨国公司。我只是一个随机的澳大利亚。</p><p>  I browsed the GUI icons for something new, and the closest was a tool for tracing socket I/O. I had tried this in 2004 ( socketsnoop.d) and published it as open source, but my tool was incomplete: I didn&#39;t have access to the kernel source code so I had to figure out everything the hard way using black box analysis. It worked for most TCP traffic types but not others, which I warned about in the script comments. I&#39;d also not included it in the DTraceToolkit yet as I didn&#39;t consider it finished. So of all the tools he had, I was most interested to see this one. Sun could do a much better job just by referring to the source code they were instrumenting, and actually finish this tool.</p><p>  我为新的东西浏览了GUI图标，最接近的是追踪套接字I / O的工具。我在2004年尝试过这个（Socketsnoop.d）并将其发布为开源，但我的工具不完整：我没有访问内核源代码，所以我必须弄清楚使用黑匣子的硬路分析。它适用于大多数TCP流量类型，而不是其他人，我在脚本评论中警告说。我＆＃39; d也没有在dtracetoolkit中包含它，因为我认为它又完成了。所以他所拥有的所有工具中，我最有兴趣看到这一点。孙可以通过参考他们的源代码来做一个更好的工作，并实际完成此工具。 </p><p> &#34;Can I see the socket I/O script?&#34;. I fired up a terminal. He looked alarmed at first, as if I wasn&#39;t supposed to look behind the curtain, then realized another selling feature: &#34;Well, sure, you could even add more tools to the GUI!&#34; and after a pause, added &#34;if you have them&#34;. Sure, I have them all right. He gave me a path to start looking under, and after a bit of searching I found the directory with all the tools he had been demoing.</p><p>＆＃34;我可以看到套接字I / O脚本吗？＆＃34;。我解雇了一个终端。他先看起来很惊慌，就好像我是＆＃39; t应该看看窗帘，然后实现另一个卖出功能：＆＃34;好吧，肯定，你甚至可以为GUI添加更多工具！＆＃34;暂停后，添加＆＃34;如果你有它们＆＃34;当然，我有它们好。他给了我一条开始看的道路，在搜索一点搜索后，我发现了一个他一直在发作的所有工具的目录。</p><p> The tools all had familiar names. One was even called socketsnoop.d. A new possibility dawned on me.</p><p> 这些工具都有熟悉的名字。一个人甚至被称为socketsnoop.d。对我来说是一种新的可能性。</p><p>  I printed socketsnoop.d. The screen filled with  my own script. It was the same incomplete attempt I had hacked up a year earlier, and published as open source. It included some weird code that only made sense when I wrote it (use of PFORMAT, prior to defaultargs) and was written in my earlier coding style. I was looking at  my own fucking script.</p><p>  我打印了socketsnoop.d。屏幕充满了自己的脚本。我同样不完整的尝试，我一年又攻击了一年，并作为开源发布。它包括一些奇怪的代码，只有在我写它时才才有意义（在DefaultArgs之前使用PFormat）并以我之前的编码样式编写。我正在看自己的他妈的脚本。</p><p>  I printed the other tools and saw the same – they were  all mine. This hot new Sun product that Mr. VIP was touring the world showing off was actually just my own open source tools.</p><p>  我印刷了另一个工具并看到了相同的工具 - 他们都是我的。这款热门新的Sun产品是VIP先生在展出世界炫耀的世界实际上只是我自己的开源工具。</p><p>   I used grep to search all his tools for my name, which was in the header comment of all my tools, to prove beyond a doubt that these were mine. But I found nothing. My name had been stripped.</p><p>   我用Grep搜索了他的所有工具，以便我的名字，这是我所有工具的标题评论，以证明这些是我的疑义。但我没有找到任何东西。我的名字被剥夺了。</p><p>   And now, here he was, in Sydney, Australia, trying to sell Brendan Gregg&#39;s tools to Brendan Gregg.</p><p>   现在，在这里，他是在澳大利亚悉尼，试图销售Brendan Gregg＆＃39;在Brendan Gregg的工具。</p><p> One of the Australian Sun staff interrupted: &#34;Those say copyright Sun Microsystems.&#34; Most of my tools had my own copyright and a GPLv2 or CDDL license. But these only had Sun&#39;s standard copyright message, and the open source licenses had been stripped.</p><p> 其中一个澳大利亚Sun工作人员中断：＆＃34;那些说得吸着版权的Sun Microsystems。＆＃34;我的大多数工具都有我自己的版权和GPLv2或CDDL许可证。但这些只有Sun＆＃39; S标准版权消息，并且剥离了开源许可证。 </p><p>  The other Aussie added, to the VIP: &#34;You  can&#39;t do that.&#34; A silence fell over the room as the magnitude of what had happened sunk in. While some at Sun were encouraging open source contributions and building a community, others were ripping off that same community. Taking their work, changing the licence and copyrights, and then selling it.</p><p>另一个澳大利亚添加了vip：＆＃34;你可以＆＃39; t做到这一点。＆＃34;由于发生沉没的程度，沉默落在房间里。虽然一些在阳光下令人鼓舞的开放来源贡献并建立一个社区，但其他人正在扯掉同一个社区。采取工作，改变许可证和版权，然后销售它。</p><p> The VIP wasn&#39;t prepared for this and had a look of confusion. He didn&#39;t say much, other than that he didn&#39;t know what had happened, and that he may have gotten the tools from someone else already like this (ie, don&#39;t blame me). He seemed to be only half believing what we were saying.</p><p> VIP WASN＆＃39; T为此准备并看起来困惑。他没有说太多了，除了他没有知道发生了什么，他可能已经从其他人那里得到了这样的工具（即不要责备我）。他似乎只相信我们所说的一半。</p><p> The meeting ended quickly. I suggested that he get newer copies of my tools, directly from the DTraceToolkit, since these older versions from my homepage were out of date, and some had errors that I had already fixed. I also reminded him to keep my name, copyright, and license on all of them.</p><p> 会议迅速结束。我建议他直接从DTRARATOOLKIT获取我的工具的更新副本，因为我的主页的这些旧版本已经过时，有些人有一些已经修复的错误。我还提醒他，以保留所有这些人的名字，版权和许可。</p><p> In his defense, perhaps the meeting may have gone differently had I not been given a low-key Australian introduction. That&#39;s an Australian cultural problem (tall poppy syndrome). To an Australian, introductions in the US can sound boastful, but they can also be useful as a quick way to share one&#39;s specialties.</p><p> 在他的辩护中，也许会议可能已经不同，因为我没有得到一个低调的澳大利亚介绍。那个澳大利亚文化问题（高罂粟综合症）。对于澳大利亚来说，美国的介绍可以听起来夸张，但它们也可以作为分享一个＆＃39; S Specialties的快速方式。</p><p>  Of all the tools I had published as open source, I still can&#39;t believe socketsnoop.d was included. It wasn&#39;t even very good. Later on I wrote much better socket tools (in my  DTrace and  BPF books).</p><p>  在我作为开放来源发布的所有工具中，我仍然可以＆＃39; T相信Socketsnoop.d。它甚至是非常好的＆＃39。后来我写了更好的套接字工具（在我的DTrace和BPF书中）。</p><p> A few years later, Apple added dozens of my tools to OS X. They left my name, copyright, and CDDL open source license intact, and even improved and enhanced some of them. Years later, Oracle did the same for Oracle Solaris 11, and the BSD community did for FreeBSD. My thanks to all of you.</p><p> 几年后，Apple将几十个工具添加到OS X.他们留下了我的名字，版权和CDDL开源许可证完整，甚至改进并增强了其中一些。几年后，Oracle对Oracle Solaris 11做了同样的事情，BSD社区为FreeBSD做了。我感谢你们所有人。</p><p> You might say that this wasn&#39;t really Sun the company doing this, but rather, a careless individual. But there was something in Sun&#39;s culture that contributed to this kind of carelessness. It was something I and my consulting colleagues had run into before: The belief at Sun that only Sun could make good use of its own technologies, and anything created outside of Sun was trash. When these Sun employees found something that was good, they were inclined to assume it came from Sun, and it was therefore safe to reuse and rebrand (and relicense) as they assumed they already held the copyrights.</p><p> 你可能会说这不是真正的孙公司这样做的，而是一个粗心的个人。但是，太阳＆＃39;文化中有一些贡献这类粗心的文化。这是我和我的咨询同事曾遇到过的：太阳只有太阳可以充分利用自己的技术，以及在阳光之外创造的东西都是垃圾的信仰。当这些Sun员工发现了很好的东西时，他们倾向于假设它来自太阳，因此可以安全地重用和重新定义（和重新定义），因为他们认为他们已经持有了版权。 </p><p> There were also others at Sun that did try hard to do the right thing by me and my work. On at least four other occasions my DTraceToolkit was built into observability products, without stripping licenses. (In one case they wanted to relicense to GPL, and talked to me and Sun legal about it, but that&#39;s another story.)</p><p>阳光下也有其他人，这确实努力做到了我和我的工作。在至少四个其他场合，我的DTRARETOOLKIT建立在可观察性产品中，而无需剥离许可证。 （在一个案例中，他们想要重新定义GPL，并与我和太阳谈谈它，但另一个故事。）</p><p> This also wasn&#39;t the last time someone unwittingly tried to sell me my own work, it was just the first. I&#39;ve learned to not tell sales people that I invented what they are showing me, as they then give me funny looks like I&#39;m a crazy person, but instead to simply say &#34;I have a lot of experience with that technology&#34; and leave it at that.</p><p> 这也是＆＃39;最后一次有人不知不觉地试图卖给我自己的工作，这只是第一个。我学会了没有告诉销售人员我发明了他们的展示我的销售人员，因为他们会给我搞笑看起来像我＆＃39;马疯人，而是简单地说＆＃34;我有很多经验与那种技术＆＃34;并离开它。</p><p> I&#39;m reminded of this first case since my BPF tools are now appearing in observability products, and will grow to a scale much bigger than my DTrace tools. I&#39;ll write about it more in future posts, but my immediate advice to developers is this: Please do not rewrite my BPF tools and the bcc libraries; build upon them as-is (either bcc Python or bcc libbpf-tool versions). They are still works-in-progress, and rewriting (forking) them divides engineering resources and has your customers using out of date versions. We are better off with all the wood behind one arrow. (Note that I think my flame graph software is different: Since it is a simple algorithm that doesn&#39;t need much maintenance, I don&#39;t see a big problem with people rewriting it. It is nice to get some thanks, however, just as I  have  done for those that inspired flame graphs.)</p><p> 我提醒了这一案例，因为我的BPF工具现在出现在可观察性产品中，并且将增长到比我的DTrace工具更大的比例。我＆＃39; ll在未来的帖子中写得更多，但我对开发人员的直接建议是这样的：请不要重写我的BPF工具和BCC库; AS-IS（BCC Python或BCC Libbpf-Tool版本）构建。它们仍然是正在进行的工作，并重写（分叉）它们划分工程资源，并使用过日期版本的客户。我们在一个箭头后面的所有木材都更好。 （请注意，我认为我的火焰图软件是不同的：因为它是一种简单的算法，它不需要多种维护，我不再看到了人们重写它的大问题。很高兴感谢但是，正如我为那些激发火焰图所做的那样。）</p><p> As for the unbelievable demo: This wasn&#39;t the great DTrace product I imagined when hearing about a world tour. It was, in fact, my own tools. I suspect that it&#39;s not uncommon for an open source developer to discover, at some point, that their own code has been rebranded. But the circumstance in this case may be a little unusual. A US developer got a world tour for software he didn&#39;t write, which included giving a sales pitch and demo in Australia, unwittingly, to the author. I don&#39;t think he even said thank you.</p><p> 至于令人难以置信的演示：这是我想象的伟大的DTRACE产品，我想象着世界巡演。事实上，它是我自己的工具。我怀疑它并不罕见，在某些时候，一个开源开发人员发现自己的代码已被重新​​命名。但这种情况下的情况可能有点不寻常。美国开发人员为他没有写的软件进行了世界之旅，其中包括在澳大利亚在不知不觉，向作者提供销售音高和演示。我不认为他甚至说谢谢。</p><p>    You can comment here, but I can&#39;t guarantee your comment will remain here forever: I might switch comment systems at some point (eg, if disqus add advertisements).</p><p>    您可以在此评论，但我可以＆＃39; t保证您的评论将永远留在这里：我可能会在某个点切换评论系统（例如，如果disqus添加广告）。</p><p> comments powered by  Disqus</p><p> 评论由Disqus提供动力 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://brendangregg.com/blog/2021-06-04/an-unbelievable-demo.html">https://brendangregg.com/blog/2021-06-04/an-unbelievable-demo.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/难以置信/">#难以置信</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
