The function of the Railway Clearing House is to clear or to apportion the receipts of the through traffic of Great Britain’s railways and of certain Irish lines and ports. Some 23,000 miles of rail routes come under the scope of the Railway Clearing House system.</p><p>                   铁路票据交换所中的排序票是由大量高技能员工组成的。铁路交换所的作用是清除或分摊英国铁路以及某些爱尔兰线路和港口的直通车收入。大约23,000英里的铁路路线属于铁路信息交换所系统的范围。</p><p>        A PROSPECTIVE passenger can walk into any station booking- office in Great Britain and purchase a ticket for practically any other station in the country -  and that ticket will take him right through to his destination, irrespective of the ownership of the lines over which he may have to travel.</p><p>        准乘客可以走进英国的任何车站预订处，并购买该国几乎任何其他车站的车票，而该车票将使他直接到达目的地，而不论他可能拥有的线路的所有权必须旅行。</p><p>    The traveller may buy a ticket at Dover, on the Southern Railway, for -  say, Oban, served by the LMS. How is the ticket money shared?</p><p>    旅行者可以在LMS服务的南部铁路的多佛购票，比如说奥本。机票钱如何分配？</p><p>    Again, a train of goods wagons on any line will often bear the initials of all the railway companies -  GWR, LMS, LNER, SR. How is carriage paid for on the goods in these wagons -  running as they do over the lines of other companies?</p><p>    同样，在任何一条线上的一列货车都会经常带有所有铁路公司的首字母缩写-GWR，LMS，LNER，SR。如何用这些货车中的货物支付运输费用-与其他公司的货物运输一样？</p><p>    In both instances settlement is made through the  Railway Clearing House. The story of the RCH, as it is usually known, goes back to the very early days of railway operation. At first there was no provision for through booking by passengers. It was not possible to send goods throughout the journey in the same wagon.</p><p>    在这两种情况下，都是通过铁路票据交换所进行结算的。众所周知，RCH的历史可以追溯到铁路运营初期。最初，旅客没有通过预订的规定。不可能在整个旅行过程中使用同一辆马车发送货物。</p><p>    The travelling public soon began to demand the convenience of through booking. Merchants, too, dissatisfied with the loss and delay occasioned by transhipping goods from one company’s wagons to those of another, agitated for a system of through- invoicing for goods traffic. The railways were forced to give facilities to meet the general demand, but for a time the difficulties of settlement between the various companies were a bar to progress.</p><p>    出差的公众很快开始要求通过预订获得便利。商家也对将货物从一家公司的货车转运到另一家公司的货车所造成的损失和延误感到不满意，这激起了对货物运输的整体开票系统。铁路被迫提供满足一般需求的设施，但是一段时间以来，各公司之间的结算困难是进步的障碍。 </p><p>    It is uncertain whether the credit for the idea of a central office to deal with the settlement of through accounts is due to  Mr. George Carr Glyn (afterwards Lord Wolverton), chairman; to  Mr. Robert Stephenson (son of George Stephenson), engineer; to Mr. Kenneth Morison, chief of audit department, all of the  London and Birmingham Railway, or to  Sir James Allport of the Midland Railway. Mr. Glyn, however, the banker, who was, of course, familiar with the methods of the historic Bankers’ Clearing House for the settlement of financial transactions, without doubt wholeheartedly supported the idea.</p><p>不能确定中央办公室处理直通帐户结算的想法是否归功于董事长乔治·卡尔·格林（George Carr Glyn）先生（后为沃尔夫顿勋爵）。致工程师罗伯特·斯蒂芬森先生（乔治·斯蒂芬森的儿子）；致伦敦和伯明翰铁路公司全部审计部门主管肯尼斯·莫里森先生，或致密德兰铁路公司詹姆斯·艾尔波特爵士。但是，格林先生是银行家，当然，他熟悉历史悠久的银行家票据交换所处理金融交易的方法，毫无疑问，他全心全意地支持这一想法。</p><p>    The Railway Clearing House was accordingly established on January 2, 1842. From that date travelling facilities began to expand.</p><p>    因此，铁路票据交换所于1842年1月2日成立。从那时起，旅行设施开始扩大。</p><p>    A staff of four men formed the nucleus of the Clearing House, which was situated in Drummond Street, opposite the present main entrance to Euston Station, a London terminus of the LMS. Business was carried on at Drummond Street until 1848, when the first block of the present building in Seymour Street, Euston Square, was built.</p><p>    由四人组成的交换所组成了票据交换所的核心，该票据交换所位于德拉蒙德街，在伦敦国际管理服务公司伦敦终点站Euston Station目前的正门对面。业务一直在德拉蒙德街（Drummond Street）开展，直到1848年，在尤斯顿广场（Euston Square）的西摩街（Seymour Street）修建了本大楼的第一块。</p><p>    The first secretary of the Clearing House was Mr. Kenneth Morison. Nine railway companies were admitted to participate in the business. They were the London and Birmingham, Midland Counties, Birmingham and Derby Junction, North Midland, Hull and Selby, Manchester and Leeds, Leeds and Selby, York and North Midland, and Great North of England. These companies have long since been merged in the constituent companies of the LMS or LNER.</p><p>    信息交换所的第一任秘书是肯尼斯·莫里森先生。九家铁路公司被接纳参与这项业务。他们是伦敦和伯明翰，米德兰县，伯明翰和德比交界处，北米德兰，赫尔和塞尔比，曼彻斯特和利兹，利兹和塞尔比，约克和北米德兰以及英格兰大北部。这些公司早已合并为LMS或LNER的组成公司。</p><p>                                                              OLD DOCUMENTS are stored in the muniment room of the Railway Clearing House, seen in the above picture. The Railway Clearing House is divided into three main departments -  the Secretarial, the Merchandise, and the Coaching sections.</p><p>                                                              如上图所示，旧文件存储在铁路票据交换所的文件室中。铁路票据交换所分为三个主要部门-秘书，商品和辅导部门。</p><p>        The traffic receipts handled by the original Clearing House were those for the through conveyance of goods, passengers, parcels and live stock between London and Darlington in one direction and between Manchester and Hull in the other.</p><p>        原始票据交换所处理的交通收入单是通过伦敦和达灵顿之间的一个方向以及曼彻斯特和赫尔之间的另一方向的货物，旅客，包裹和牲畜运输。</p><p>    The railways included in the RCH system had increased by 1845 to sixteen, with 656 route- miles of track. The difficulties of obtaining cash settlement between the railway companies and the clearing house, led in 1850 to the passing of an  Act of Parliament conferring on the RCH the right to sue in the courts. This ended the trouble and the companies subsequently settled all payments promptly.</p><p>    RCH系统中包含的铁路已增加了1845条，增至16条，有656条路线英里。铁路公司和票据交换所之间难以获得现金结算的情况，导致在1850年通过了一项赋予RCH法院起诉权的议会法案。这样就解决了麻烦，公司随后迅速结清了所有款项。 </p><p>    The Railway Clearing House was Incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1897. From its beginning it had been under the control of a Committee consisting of one delegate from each of the companies under the system. Changes were made, however, under the Railway Clearing House Amalgamation Scheme of 1922.</p><p>铁路票据交换所是根据1897年的《议会法》成立的。从一开始，它就由一个委员会控制，该委员会由该系统下各公司的一名代表组成。但是，根据1922年的铁路票据交换所合并计划进行了更改。</p><p>    The corporation now consists of four delegates from each of the four great amalgamated companies and one from each of the other companies, namely the London Passenger Transport Board, Mersey Railway, the lines of the Joint Committees, and the Irish Companies. An executive or “Superintending Committee” of eight members is elected from the delegates of the corporation.</p><p>    该公司现在由四家合并后的公司的四名代表以及伦敦客运委员会，默西铁路公司，联合委员会和爱尔兰公司的其他公司的四名代表组成。从公司代表中选出由八名成员组成的执行委员会或“监督委员会”。</p><p>    The number of companies working under the RCH system to- day is fifteen, with a total route length of 23,000 miles -  a figure in striking contrast to the 656 miles of 1845. The receipts of the Clearing House for 1842 were £193,246; for 1933 the amount involved was over £34,000,000, an equally striking comparison.</p><p>    如今，在RCH体系下工作的公司总数为15家，总路线长度为23,000英里-与1845年的656英里形成鲜明对比。1842年的票据交换所的收入为193,246英镑； 1933年，涉案金额超过3400万英镑，这是一个惊人的比较。</p><p>    The work of the Railway Clearing House is divided into three Departments -  Merchandise, Coaching, and Secretarial.</p><p>    铁路票据交换所的工作分为三个部门-商品部门，教练部门和秘书部门。</p><p>    The Merchandise Department apportions the receipts from the carriage of goods, minerals, and livestock. Coal traffic was formerly settled through the Clearing House, but adjustments are now made by the originating Company, which collects the charges and pays out the other companies&#39; proportions.</p><p>    商品部对运输货物，矿产和牲畜的收据进行分配。煤炭运输以前是通过票据交换所结算的，但现在由发起公司进行调整，由发起公司收取费用并向其他公司付款。比例。</p><p>    The first function of the Railway Clearing System is to ensure that charges in which two or more companies are concerned are correctly accounted for at both terminal stations, from which the respective agents send information each month to the Clearing House. Any differences between the two sets of accounts are then settled by correspondence through the Audit offices.</p><p>    铁路清算系统的第一个功能是确保在两个终端站正确计算涉及两个或多个公司的费用，各个代理商每月从该站向信息交换所发送信息。然后，通过审计办公室以信函方式解决两组帐户之间的任何差异。</p><p>    Perhaps the best means of understanding the system will be to consider, for example, a consignment of goods from Bristol (LMS) to Southampton (Southern) via The Somerset and Dorset Joint (between Bath and Templecombe).</p><p>    理解该系统的最佳方法也许是考虑例如从布里斯托尔（LMS）经由萨默塞特郡和多塞特郡联合处（巴斯与Templecombe之间）到南安普敦（南部）的一批货物。 </p><p>    We will assume that the load weighs 10 tons and the charge is £10, of which half is “paid” at Bristol and the other half “to be paid” at Southampton. On making a settlement there are three companies to share in the receipt of £10 -  the LMS (Bristol to Bath), the Somerset and Dorset Joint (Bath to Templecombe), and the Southern Railway (Templecombe to Southampton).</p><p>我们假设货物重10吨，费用为10英镑，其中一半在布里斯托尔“付”，另一半在南安普敦“付”。达成和解后，将有3家公司分享10英镑的收据-LMS（从布里斯托尔到巴斯），萨默塞特和多塞特联合（从巴斯到Templecombe）以及南部铁路（从Templecombe到南安普敦）。</p><p>    The first adjustment to be made on the accounts is that relative to what are known as “terminal services”, such as collection and delivery charges. The balance of the total charges is usually divided on a mileage basis, according to the distance the load is carried over each of the railways. There are, however, a number of exceptions to this principle, such as agreed apportionments, fixed tolls on tonnage, and other special methods of division.</p><p>    要对帐户进行的第一个调整是相对于所谓的“终端服务”，例如收取和交付费用。总费用的余额通常根据里程在每条铁路上的承载距离来划分。但是，该原则也有许多例外情况，例如议定的分摊额，吨位固定通行费以及其他特殊的划分方法。</p><p>                          This leaves a residue from £10 of £7 13s 4d, which is divided on a mileage basis, taking the total distance at 100 miles -  10 miles on the LMS, 30 miles on the Somerset and Dorset Joint, and 60 miles on the Southern Railway.</p><p>                          这会从10英镑的剩余7英镑13s 4d中剩余，按里程划分，取总距离为100英里-LMS为10英里，萨默塞特郡和多塞特联合镇为30英里，南部地区为60英里铁路。</p><p>                                                      If there had been traffic in the reverse direction, the two entries would have been combined in one settlement to cover both “up” and “down” traffic.</p><p>                                                      如果有反向交通，则这两个条目将合并为一个结算，以涵盖“向上”和“向下”交通。</p><p>    To minimize the clerical work involved, it is now the practice to limit individual division to the larger monthly sums, and to make a bulk settlement of the smaller monthly amounts. In practice, the larger amounts are not divided in detail until the close of the half years ended June and December. Each month “interim” accounts are brought out and payments made “on account” to the companies concerned, subject to adjustment at the half- yearly settlement.</p><p>    为了尽量减少所涉及的文书工作，现在的做法是将单独的划分限制为较大的每月金额，并批量结算较小的每月金额。实际上，直到6月和12月的半年结束时才对较大的金额进行详细划分。每个月都会开出“临时”账户，并“向”相关公司“支付”款项，并在半年结算时进行调整。</p><p>        The bulk settlement of small amounts is made on a basis of total receipts per pair of companies, irrespective of route. After a percentage deduction for terminal charges, the remainder is divided half- yearly, on an agreed formula. This is done to avoid many separate calculations. Since in each half year there are as many as three million transactions, three- fourths of are which “small”, the saving of work will be obvious.</p><p>        少量结算是基于每对公司的总收入进行的，与路线无关。在扣除了终端费用的百分比后，其余部分按商定的公式每半年分配一次。这样做是为了避免许多单独的计算。由于每半年有多达300万笔交易，其中四分之三是“小笔交易”，因此工作量的节省将是显而易见的。</p><p>    Passenger traffic is dealt with through the Railway Clearing House on different lines, and is divided by its Coaching Depart- ment into two main categories -  a “two companies” group and a “three companies” group. Under each of these heads, ordinary (including monthly and tourist tickets) and excursion bookings are dealt with separately. With “two companies” traffic, where only two railway systems are interested, the booking company shows particulars on its returns of the booking and also of the other company’s proportion of the receipts. This proportion is then credited by the Clearing House to the company to which it is due and entered as a debit against the booking company. The booking company’s returns are then sent forward to the non- booking companies for agreement or any necessary adjustment.</p><p>    旅客交通通过铁路票据交换所以不同的路线处理，并由其教练部门分为两个主要类别：“两个公司”组和“三个公司”组。在这些标题下，普通（包括月票和旅游票）和游览预订分别处理。在只有两个铁路系统感兴趣的“两家公司”交通情况下，预订公司会显示其预订退货的详细信息以及另一家公司在收据中所占的比例。然后，此比例由票据交换所记入应付款公司，并作为对订票公司的借方记入。然后，预订公司的退货将发送给非预订公司，以达成协议或进行任何必要的调整。 </p><p>    “Three companies” passenger traffic is similarly returned by the booking company, but the other companies’ proportions are not shown. The apportionment is made by the RCH in accordance with a method agreed between the companies con- cerned. The booking company, since it is in possession of the cash, retains its proportion of the total receipts and the RCH deals only with the proportions of the non- booking companies.</p><p>预订公司以类似方式返回“三公司”的客运量，但未显示其他公司的比例。由RCH按照有关公司之间商定的方法进行分配。由于预订公司拥有现金，因此保留其在总收入中所占的比例，而RCH仅与非预订公司的比例进行交易。</p><p>                                                                    THE EXTERIOR of the Railway Clearing House building in Seymour Street, London. The first block of the building shown above was built in 1848. The Railway Clearing House itself was established in 1842, and later incorporated by Acts of Parliament in 1850 and 1897.</p><p>                                                                    伦敦西摩街铁路票据交换所大楼的外部。上图所示建筑的第一栋楼建于1848年。铁路票据交换所本身于1842年成立，后来在1850年和1897年被国会法案合并。</p><p>        To consider an example, suppose £100 worth of passenger traffic is booked by the LMS, of which £30 is due for division among other companies. The latter, however, may owe the LMS, say, £50 in respect of their own bookings. The result will be, therefore, a credit of £20, which is paid to the LMS by the Clearing House.</p><p>        举一个例子，假设LMS预定了价值100英镑的客运量，其中30英镑应由其他公司分摊。但是，后者可能要为LMS自己的预订支付50英镑。因此，结果将是一笔20英镑的信用，由票据交换所支付给LMS。</p><p>    Where the receipts are 60s or under from one station to another (over one route) in a month, they are dealt with by what is known as a “light fund” arrangement. The light fund is apportioned in ratio to an actual division of similar traffic receipts in tour selected months prior to the month of settlement.</p><p>    如果收据在一个月内从一个站点到另一站点（通过一条路线）到60s或以下，则通过所谓的“轻型资金”安排进行处理。在结算月之前选定的几个月中，按与实际交通收入实际划分的比例分配轻型基金。</p><p>    The traffic returns of the booking companies are checked by the RCH by means of the tickets collected at the end of the journey. The tickets are sent to the Clearing House each month, where they are sorted into booking- company so as to facilitate comparison with the returns. This check efficiently safeguards the interests of the non- booking companies.</p><p>    RCH通过旅程结束时收集的车票检查订票公司的交通回报。门票每个月都会发送到票据交换所，在票据交换所中被分类到订票公司，以便于与退货进行比较。该检查有效地维护了非预订公司的利益。</p><p>    Parcel traffic is another important branch of Clearing House work. The present system of forwarding parcels was introduced in 1917, and involves the use of adhesive stamps affixed by the forwarding station agent, to cover the conveyance charges. Details of each parcel dispatched, and of the value of the stamps affixed are entered in a counter book, the receipts forming part of what is known as a “parcel pool”. The parcel pool is divided each month on an agreed basis, the apportionment being based on the receipts and number of parcels carried respectively in the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 (taken as a standard) and the number of parcels carried in the current month.</p><p>    包裹运输是票据交换所工作的另一个重要分支。本运送包裹的系统是在1917年引入的，它涉及使用运送站代理人粘贴的不干胶邮票来支付运输费用。派送的每个包裹的详细信息以及所贴邮票的价值都输入到柜台簿中，收据构成所谓“包裹池”的一部分。包裹库每月在商定的基础上进行划分，分摊的依据是分别在1928年，1929年和1930年（以标准为准）的收据和包裹数量以及当月的包裹数量。</p><p>    Before the passing of the  Post Office (Parcels) Act of 1882 the railway companies had practically the monopoly of parcel traffic. Although the Postmaster- General was prepared to accept parcels from the public, he was dependent mainly on the railways for conveyance. It was enacted that the PMG should pay the Railway Clearing House, each quarter, an agreed percentage of gross receipts collected by the Post Office in respect of parcels carried by rail. Over ninety per cent of the Post Office parcels are carried by the railways.</p><p>    在1882年《邮局（包裹）法》通过之前，铁路公司实际上垄断了包裹运输。尽管邮政局长准备好接受公众的包裹，但他主要依靠铁路运输。根据规定，PMG应每个季度向铁路票据交换所支付邮政局就铁路运输包裹收取的总收据的约定百分比。铁路运输的邮局包裹超过90％。 </p><p>          TRAFFIC RETURNS of the different railway companies are checked by the Railway Clearing House. The tickets surrendered to the collectors at the end of journeys are despatched to the Clearing House each month. This illustration shows how they are sorted into order so that the returns may be checked.</p><p>铁路票据交换所检查不同铁路公司的交通收益。旅程结束时交还给收藏家的门票每个月都会发往票据交换所。下图显示了如何对它们进行排序，以便可以检查退货。</p><p>          The Post Office accounts to the RCH by taking a count of all parcels delivered at every post office throughout the kingdom, and for one week in each quarter a detailed list is prepared showing postage of every parcel posted, and whether conveyed by rail or road. The average postage per parcel and the percentage of rail and road- borne parcels form the basis on which the railway companies receive their remuneration from the Post Office.</p><p>          邮局通过计算整个王国每个邮局交付的所有包裹的数量，向RCH核算，并在每个季度的一个星期内准备一份详细清单，显示所邮寄的每个包裹的邮资以及是否通过铁路或公路运输。每个包裹的平均邮费以及铁路和公路包裹的百分比构成了铁路公司从邮局获得报酬的基础。</p><p>    Apportionment, through the RCH, of the receipts among the railway companies is based partly on the number of PO receptacles carried and partly on each company’s earnings from ordinary parcel traffic,</p><p>    通过RCH对铁路公司的收据进行分配，部分是基于所携带的PO接收器的数量，另一部分是基于各公司从普通包裹运输中获得的收益，</p><p>    Another function of the RCH is operation of the “Bulk Travel” arrangement, which, by the issue of vouchers, enables traders and their employees to travel on business between any two stations in the United Kingdom at special rates. The trader must have incurred at least £300 in freight charges during the year before an application is made, and a minimum distance of 10,000 miles must be travelled within twelve months.</p><p>    RCH的另一个功能是“批量旅行”安排的运作，通过发放凭单，贸易商及其雇员可以以特殊价格在英国任何两个车站之间进行商务旅行。在提出申请之前的一年中，商人必须承担至少300英镑的运费，并且在12个月内必须行驶至少10,000英里。</p><p>    A commercial firm participating in the scheme deposits a sum of money with the RCH, and is then issued with books of vouchers. These are filled in as necessary and presented at the railway booking offices to obtain tickets, for which no payment is made at the time. There are now 3,000 firms for whom ledger accounts under the scheme are kept at the Clearing House, and monthly statements are rendered to them showing the balance standing to their credit.</p><p>    参加该计划的一家商业公司向RCH存入一笔钱，然后发行凭证书。这些票会根据需要填写，并在铁路售票处出示，以获取车票，当时无需付款。现在，该计划下有3,000家公司的账本存放在票据交换所中，并向他们提供月度报表，显示其贷方余额。</p><p>    We have seen how goods and passenger traffic are handled respectively through the Merchandise and Coaching depart- ments of the Clearing House. The third department is the Secretarial. This is sub- divided into two sections, the “Mileage” and “General”. The work of the Mileage Section is again sub- divided into three further sections, which deal respectively with charges of “mileage” and “demurrage” on coaching stock, the “balancing” of wagons under the “common user” system, and the apportionment of charges under the “journey payment” scheme.</p><p>    我们已经了解了如何通过票据交换所的商品和教练部门分别处理货物和旅客流量。第三部门是秘书。这分为两部分，“里程”和“常规”。里程科的工作又分为三个部分，分别处理长途汽车的“里程”和“滞期费”，“普通用户”制度下货车的“平衡”以及分摊费用。 “旅程付款”计划下的费用。</p><p>    “Mileage” is a charge payable to a company for the loan of its coaching stock to other companies where “through” coaches or trains are run. The mileage charge is fixed by a tariff, and involves an obligation on the receiving company to return the stock within certain periods and by appropriate routes, subject to a penalty known as the “demurrage” charge. Mileage and demurrage accounts relating to coaching stock are based mainly on weekly returns from all junctions where stock is exchanged, and from station returns of arrival and departure of foreign stock.</p><p>    “里程”是应向一家公司支付的教练车借给其他公司的费用，这些公司通过“教练”或“直通车”运行。里程费用由关税确定，涉及接收公司有义务在一定时期内和通过适当的路线归还存货，并受到称为“滞期费”的罚款。与客车存量有关的里程和滞期费账户主要基于交换存量的所有路口的周收益以及外国存货到达和离开的车站收益。 </p><p>    Mileage and demurrage charges were at one time raised on wagons, and their covering sheets or tarpaulins. Wagons at the end of a journey were unloaded and sent back empty to the forwarding company -  thus causing an enormous amount of unnecessary haulage. A company would frequently return empty wagons to another company at a junction and at the same time receive from that company its own empty wagons.</p><p>一次提高了货车及其覆盖物或防水油布的里程和滞期费。旅途结束时将货车卸下，然后空载回货运公司-这样会造成大量不必要的运输。一家公司经常会在联结处将空货车交还给另一家公司，同时又从该公司接收自己的空货车。</p><p>    Conditions arising out of the war of 1914- 18 brought about one of the most important changes in the history of the RCH. The immediate use of all stock was necessary, and wagons and sheets were urgently needed overseas for the use of the British and allied armies.</p><p>    1914至18年战争产生的情况带来了RCH历史上最重要的变化之一。必须立即使用所有库存，并且在国外急需使用货车和床单供英国和盟军使用。</p><p>        In January, 1917, the “common user” system was inaugurated for all railway companies’ wagons in Great Britain, although such an arrangement had been in operation previously between certain of the larger companies.</p><p>        1917年1月，英国所有铁路公司的货车都启用了“通用用户”系统，尽管这种安排以前已经在某些大型公司之间实行。</p><p>    Under “common user”, with certain exceptions, all wagons up to a carrying capacity of twelve tons are regarded as common property; and a company may load into any wagon, irrespective of ownership, which may be standing empty. Similarly, the load may be covered by any sheet. A trader also may use any railway company’s wagon that has delivered goods into his siding or works for an outward load if required.</p><p>    在“普通用户”下，除某些例外外，所有载重不超过十二吨的货车均视为共同财产；并且公司可能会随身携带任何货车，而不论所有权如何。类似地，负载可以用任何薄片覆盖。如果需要，商人也可以使用将货物运到侧板的铁路公司的货车，也可以使用向外运输的货车。</p><p>    To ensure that companies benefit equally under the “common user” scheme, the movements of all wagons passing from one railway system to another are recorded at exchange junctions and forwarded to the RCH. By means of these returns it is possible to ascertain the number of vehicles received or forwarded in excess of the exchanges, which have to be repaid in empty stock. Settlements are made by the Clearing House every three days, and the companies concerned are called upon to transfer the empty wagons accordingly.</p><p>    为了确保公司在“普通用户”计划下均能从中受益，所有从一个铁路系统到另一个铁路系统的货车的行进都记录在换乘枢纽处，并转发给RCH。通过这些退货，可以确定收货或转发的车辆数量是否超过交换所需要偿还的库存量。交换所每三天进行一次定居，要求有关公司相应地转移空货车。</p><p>    The “common user” arrangement made it difficult to apply mileage charges to stock under that system, so a “journey payment” scheme was inaugurated, whereby a fixed payment per wagon per journey is made in respect of all loaded wagons exchanged between the different companies. The scheme does not cover coal or mixed traffic, but it covers stock of over twelve tons capacity. Apportionments of the “journey payment” receipts are made by the Clearing House every six months.</p><p>    “普通用户”安排使得在该系统下难以对库存应用里程费，因此启动了“旅程付款”计划，从而针对不同公司之间交换的所有装载货车，对每辆货车的每次行程进行固定付款。 。该计划不涵盖煤炭或混合交通，但涵盖了十二吨以上的存货。交换所每六个月分配一次“旅程付款”收据。</p><p>                                                                    THE BOARD- ROOM of the Railway Clearing House. The organization is controlled by a committee comprising four representatives from the board of each of the main British companies and one from each of the other companies concerned. The total number of companies working under the system is fifteen .</p><p>                                                                    铁路票据交换所的会议室。该组织由一个委员会控制，该委员会由英国各主要公司的董事会的四名代表和其他有关公司的一名代表组成。该系统下的公司总数为15家。 </p><p>        Although we have considered the main functions of the RCH, there are other activities carried out by the Secretarial Department.</p><p>尽管我们已经考虑了RCH的主要功能，但秘书部还开展了其他活动。</p><p>    The control of the Clearing House rests with the General Section of the Secretarial Department, which, from the inception of the Clearing House, has dealt with the administration of the establishment, staff matters, and the maintenance of premises. Very early, however, in the history of the railways it was found necessary that the companies’ officers should have a common meeting ground, not only for the purpose of dealing with matters affecting the railway companies themselves and the working of the railways, but also for the purpose of considering the multitude of questions which arose between the railways and their patrons the public. Conferences of general managers, goods managers, superintendents, commercial managers, accountants, engineers (civil and mechanical), solicitors, advertising managers, chemists, and other railway officials and their representatives are held periodically at the Clearing House. Practically every description of railway officer has his appointed conference, and the numerous problems which constantly arise in connexion with railway transport are discussed in the board-  and meeting- rooms which form part of the accommodation of the department. The work associated with these meetings involves extensive correspondence with the public and the tabulation of voluminous information. Here also the companies from time to time meet representatives of various trade organizations and individual traders to discuss matters of mutual interest affecting the charging and conveyance of traffic over the railways. There is hardly a trade organization in the country or any business house of importance that has not at some time or other had some transaction with the RCH.</p><p>    信息交换所的总务处由信息交换所的总务处控制，该司自信息交换所成立以来一直负责机构的管理，人事和房舍维护。但是，在铁路历史的早期，发现公司的管理人员应该有一个共同的会议场所，不仅是为了处理影响铁路公司自身和铁路运营的事项，而且为了考虑铁路及其顾客之间出现的众多问题。总经理，商品经理，总监，商业经理，会计师，工程师（土木和机械），律师，广告经理，化学家和其他铁路官员及其代表的会议定期在票据交换所举行。实际上，铁路官员的每一次描述都有其任命的会议，并且与铁路运输相关的不断出现的众多问题在董事会和会议室中进行了讨论，这些会议室是该部门办公场所的一部分。这些会议的工作涉及与公众的广泛往来以及大量信息的列表。在这里，公司还会不时会见各种贸易组织和个体贸易商的代表，讨论共同关心的问题，这些问题会影响铁路运输的收费和运输。该国几乎没有一个贸易组织或任何重要的企业在某个时候或其他人与RCH没有任何交易。</p><p>        In one month as many as 180 meetings have been held at the Offices of the Clearing Ho</p><p>        在一个月的时间里，交换所办公室举行了多达180次会议</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.railwaywondersoftheworld.com/clearing-house.html">https://www.railwaywondersoftheworld.com/clearing-house.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/铁路/">#铁路</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/clearing/">#clearing</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
