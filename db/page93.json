So much so that, every year in October, the annual tax returns of Norwegian citizens are posted online on the Norwegian Tax Administration\u2019s official  website, and anyone can go and have a look. This tradition of publicly sharing everyone\u2019s earnings is not new, but it is very telling about the kind of society, and tax system, that Norwegians wish to have.\n  Personal income tax was first introduced in Norway back in 1882, and it was a public affair from the very beginning. This was almost a century before  oil was found in the North Sea, and back then, Norway was a relatively poor country, whose people were mostly farmers with a long history of fighting back on taxation, and whose municipalities were self-governed. Everyone was expected to give as much as they were able to keep the poor relief fund and the school fund running; if everything was out in the open, no one could complain. Back then, citizens would go to the City Hall or the local tax office to consult the tax lists, and in this way people could make sure that everyone was contributing fairly.\n  Religion also played a key part in this: Norway, as well as the rest of Scandinavia, has been a Lutheran country since the early 1500s, when the Protestant Reformation took place in Europe. Core Protestant values such as frugality, humility and hard work have been imbued into Scandinavians for centuries \u2013 paying one\u2019s taxes and contributing to the communal pot so that the state can help others was all part of being a good Christian.\n  Janteloven (the Law of Jante), a set of unspoken rules followed by most people in the Nordic countries (and first documented in 1933 by author  Aksel Sandemose), further enhances that Protestant mindset.  Janteloven warns against the perceived evils of individualism; Scandinavians are taught that they should not think they\u2019re special, or believe that they\u2019re better than their fellow Scandinavians. Privacy, in this context, is less coveted than it might be in a more individualistic and opportunistic society: when it comes to financial issues, one does not need privacy if one has nothing to hide.\n  Janteloven has played an integral part in Norway\u2019s and Sweden\u2019s policy of publishing everyone\u2019s salaries, and this helps to ensure that everyone gets the same amount of money for the same kind of work (in Sweden in particular, this policy has contributed significantly towards eliminating the  gender pay disparity). But it has also turned taxation into a way in which people can show that they trust the state. Norway uses a bracket tax rate that ensures the tax burden is distributed fairly depending on income, and the tax is deducted directly from your salary each month. This allows the state to use the tax money to keep funding its extensive public sector, from healthcare and education to transport and communications. Everyone can see that the system works, as everyone benefits from the social provisions of the state, so everyone is (mostly) eager to keep paying taxes.\n  Today, in a world where presidents and prime ministers of some countries famously refuse to disclose their tax returns, Norway\u2019s policy of publishing everything online can come as a shock to non-Scandinavians. In Sweden and Finland, people can find out about anyone else\u2019s tax returns just by making a phone call, but Norway is the only country where you can just look up that information on a government website. Some worry that this practice could lead to people snooping around to find out what their neighbours are earning, or how much tax their boss is paying. They\u2019re not entirely wrong to worry: in both Sweden and Norway, there has been a wave of what tabloids call \u2018tax porn\u2019, meaning people visiting the website for no other reason than to spy on what other people earn.\n  Thankfully, there are countermeasures in place to ensure that people are not abusing this service. Ever since 2014, you need to log in to access the information, and when you check the tax returns of a specific individual, your search is catalogued; when the person you searched for logs into the system, they can see right away that you searched for them. In addition, you can view a maximum of 500 records a month, although this restriction doesn\u2019t apply to journalists.\n  This transparency around tax in Norway makes it hard for people to consider tax evasion, if they were even so inclined. And it definitely keeps most companies in check, both in terms of declaring profits and when it comes to offering competitive salaries. When everyone can see how much everyone else is making, a conversation about a raise suddenly becomes that much easier \u2013 or unnecessary.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:00:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7533\u62a5\u8868,country,\u632a\u5a01", "title": "\u632a\u5a01\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u6709\u516c\u5171\u7eb3\u7a0e\u7533\u62a5\u8868\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff082018\u5e74\uff09", "title_en": "Norway Is the Only Country with Public Tax Returns (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://theculturetrip.com/europe/norway/articles/norway-country-public-tax-returns/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7533\u62a5\u8868", "country", "\u632a\u5a01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e4d22e129f8735e98d41851051ec12b5.png", "infoid": 1072463, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eba\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u516c\u53f8/\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8d26\u6237\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u4e0d\u5ba3\u4f20\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u4eec\uff1a\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u767b\u5f55\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5931\u8d25 - \u4ed6\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206 - \u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u771f\u7684.How\uff1f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\uff1a\n\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8b66\u544a\uff1f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5177\u6709\u4f7f\u5176\u5bb9\u6613\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\n\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u662f\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\u8b66\u544a\u4e2d\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u4fe1\u5f92\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d8a\u5c11\u3002", "note_en": "People expect companies/services to tell them when untoward things could be happening to their accounts:\n  These examples are things you  should probably be notified about.But, if you go overboard with these warnings, you might find phishers triggering them   intentionally.\n    Eek.Well, you\u2019re not in $Country, and you weren\u2019t just logging into your account\u2026Is someone trying to credential-stuff you?\n As you\u2019re trying to remember whether you actually used a unique password on this account, your phone rings.The caller introduces themselves as from the $eShop security team where they\u2019ve just blocked a takeover of your account.To secure your account, they need to walk you through the reset process over the phone.\n Hopefully, you\u2019re suspicious\u2014this is a common phishing lure\u2014but everything seems to check out:\n  So you oblige and go through an account reset process with them.They assure you they\u2019ve successfully stopped the attack and your account is now secure.Phew!\n   The caller was of course not from the $eShop security team.Instead, they were compromising your account using the details you gave them over the phone.\n But, the failed login email\u2014the key part of their believability\u2014was completely genuine.How? Simple:\n The phisher somehow learned your email, phone number, and that you were an $eShop customer. (Often not a difficult task given the number of data breaches available to correlate together.)\n The phisher used a bogus password to try to log into your account, intentionally generating the failed login email. They can use a VPN so that a suitably worrying country gets reported as the source.\n Then they called you and could be incredibly convincing because they knew the contents of the email you just received.\n This perfectly sensible sounding security feature (warning that someone might be trying to log into your account) is easily abused by a phisher to attack your account.\n And can you blame them?The ability to send a scary-sounding warning to any user sounds like a feature  built for phishers.\n So that they\u2019re more likely to believe my pretense and give me their credentials\n  Why was this a bad security warning?Because it had all the properties that make it easy to abuse.\n It was easy to trigger by attackers. \u201cYou\u2019ve logged in on a new device\u201d isn\u2019t very abusable\u2014by that point, the attacker already has control over your account.But a failed login email is extremely abusable\u2014attackers can trigger it without knowing anything more than your username or email address.\n It contained predictable, and worse, controllable content. The phisher was so believable because they could control (and hence know the value of) the country from which the failed login was attempted. Including more details, like the IP address of the failed login, would only make them more believable.\n The timing was predictable. Would the phisher have been so believable if they called before the warning email arrived or hours afterwards?Probably not.Either they\u2019d seem like every other tech support scam (with no warning email to back them up), or you\u2019d have already checked out your account yourself, finding it perfectly safe.\n (note: just adding a delay isn\u2019t sufficient. A fixed one hour delay on the warning requires slightly more planning from attackers but is otherwise just as abusable.)\n  Is the warning  essential? A warning that doesn\u2019t exist can\u2019t be abused.\n What knowledge is required to trigger it? If all a phisher needs is an email to trigger the warning, they\u2019ve got a huge pool of potential victims. Even simple knowledge-based challenges will make large scale abuse harder.\n What\u2019s the minimum amount of information you need to include? The less detail in the warning, the less insider knowledge a phisher can appear to possess.\n Does the warning need to be immediate? Unless the user needs to respond immediately, adding a random delay could make it much harder to abuse.\n Dealing with phishing sites manually? Check out  Phish Report!

Called in official parlance not censorship but publications control\u2014censorship was a word it sought to censor from public discourse about itself\u2014it controlled every form in which signs could be publicly disseminated, that is, not only books, magazines, newspapers, films, etc., but T-shirts, key-rings, dolls, toys, shop-signs\u2014anything, in fact, that might carry a forbidden message or representation. Every new T-shirt, key-ring, etc., as well as every new book, film, etc., had to pass the scrutiny of the censorship bureaucracy before it could be released upon the public. In the old Soviet Union there were some 70,000 bureaucrats supervising the activities of some 7,000 writers. The ratio of censors to writers in South Africa was, if anything, higher than ten to one.\n When a man reacts to the world around him as though the air is filled with coded messages deriding him or plotting his destruction, we call him paranoid. For decades the South African state behaved in a paranoid fashion. In itself, as a feature of what we can call the mentality of the state, the phenomenon is nothing new. Paranoia is the pathology par excellence of dictatorships. Among modern dictators Stalin was perhaps the most demonstrably and the most extremely paranoid. We can fairly say that of the millions who died at his behest a good proportion were victims of his paranoid delusions.\n One of the features distinguishing modern dictatorships from earlier dictatorships is how widely and rapidly the modern dictator\u2019s paranoia, or the paranoia of a ruling clique, can be disseminated to infect the populace as a whole. In fact it has been a positive strategy of government among modern paranoid dictatorships to spread their paranoia. Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union is again the prime example: every citizen was encouraged to suspect every other citizen of being a spy or saboteur; the bonds of human sympathy and trust between people were broken down; and \u201cSoviet society\u201d became in fact just a name for tens of millions of individuals living on individual islands of mutual suspicion and terror of one another.\n The Soviet Union was not unique. The Cuban novelist Reinaldo Arenas wrote of the atmosphere of \u201cunceasing official menace\u201d in his country that made a citizen \u201cnot only a repressed person, but also a self-repressed one, not only a censored person, but a self-censored one, not only one watched over, but one who watches over himself.\u201d  1 Exemplary punitive action in a context of \u201cunceasing official menace\u201d is an argument hard to resist: one effect to make certain kinds of writing and even speech a guilty activity, thereby reproducing the paranoia of the state in the psyche of the subject. Thus may the state look forward to the day when the censorship bureaucracy can afford to wither away, its function having been, in effect, privatized.\n I may seem to fling the word paranoia around rather loosely. The paranoia of the tyrant\u2014yes, perhaps. But if the writer stands a chance of being packed off to a real, objective reeducation camp, why should one call that paranoia rather than justifiable watchfulness?\n My answer is, No. The watchfulness of the writer in the paranoid state has a pathological quality that truly tips it over into paranoia. The evidence I call upon here comes from writers themselves. Time and again they record the feeling of being touched and contaminated by the sickness of the state. In a move typical of \u201cauthentic\u201d paranoids, they claim that their minds have been invaded; it is against this invasion that they express their outrage.\n The Greek writer George Mangakis, for instance, records the experience of writing in prison under the eyes of his guards. Every few days the guards searched his cell, taking away his writings and returning those which the prison authorities\u2014the censors\u2014considered \u201cpermissible.\u201d Mangakis recalls accepting his papers back and suddenly \u201cloathing\u201d them. \u201cThe system is a diabolical device for annihilating your own soul. They want to make you see your thoughts through their eyes and control them yourself, from their point of view.\u201d  2 By forcing the writer to see what he has written through the censor\u2019s eyes, the censor forces him to internalize a contaminating reading; Mangakis\u2019 sudden, revulsive moment is the moment of contamination.\n The ultimate proof that something has, so to speak, gone wrong with writers like Arenas or Mangakis is the excessiveness of the language of their response. To put the point in another way: as I use the term paranoia, it is not a figurative way of describing the situation of such a writer. Rather, the paranoia is on the inside, in the language, in the thinking; the terror and rage one hears in Mangakis\u2019 words is terror and rage at the most intimate of invasions, an invasion of the very style of the self, by a pathology for which there may be no cure. I suspect the same paranoia may be felt in my own language, as I write here: in the excessive insistence of its phrasing, in its vehemence, its demands for sensitivity to minutiae of style. The South African censorship began to wind down in the decade of the 1980s; today it is virtually dormant; yet I lived through its heyday, saw its consequences not only on the lives of fellow-writers but on the totality of public discourse, felt in my own person some of its more secret effects, and so must contemplate the possibility that I share (or feel I share) the position of an Arenas or a Mangakis because I too may have been infected with whatever infected them, real or delusional. That is to say, this essay may be a specimen of the same kind of paranoid discourse it seeks to describe.\n I stress that the paranoia I am talking about is not the imprint of censorship on those writers alone who have become the objects of official persecution. All writing that in the normal course of events can fall under the censor\u2019s eye may become tainted in the manner I have described, whether or not the censor passes it. All writers under censorship are at least potentially driven to paranoia, not just those who have books banned.\n Why should this be so? I can give only a speculative answer. It is an answer based not only on introspection, however: it is also based on a scrutiny (I should caution the reader, however: perhaps a paranoid scrutiny) of the accounts other writers (who may themselves have been infected with paranoia) have given of operating under regimes of censorship.\n No one believes any longer that the self is the monadic unit described by classical rationalism. On the contrary, we picture the self as multiple and in many ways divided against itself. We picture it as a zoo, for instance, in which all kinds of strange beasts have residence, over which the anxious, overworked zookeeper of rationality has rather limited control. In this zoo there are few internal bars. At night the zookeeper sleeps and some of the beasts roam about (we call this dreaming).\n Which, in this psychoanalytic fantasy, arc the beasts in the zoo of the self? Some have names like figure-of-the-father and figure-of-the-mother; others are memories or fragments of memories in transmuted form, with strong elements of feeling attached to them; a whole subcolony are semi-tamed but still treacherous earlier versions of the self, each with an inner zoo of its own over which it has less than complete control.\n Artists, says Freud, are people who move around in the inner menagerie with a degree of confidence and emerge from it when they wish more or less unscathed. Whether Freud\u2019s account of the creative process holds water is not my concern here. I poach from it one element: that artistic creation of a certain kind involves inhabiting and managing and exploiting quite primitive parts of the self. This is not a particularly dangerous activity but it is a delicate one, one that may take a writer years of preparation till he/she finally gets the codes and the keys and the balances right, and can move in and out more or less freely. It is also a very private matter, so private that it almost constitutes the definition of privacy: how I am with myself.\n Managing the inner selves, making them work for one (making them productive) is a complex matter of pleasing and satisfying and challenging and extorting and wooing and feeding, and sometimes even of destroying. For writing not only comes out of the zoo but (I become hypermetaphorical now) goes back in again. That is to say, insofar as writing is transactional, the figures for whom and to whom it is done are also figures in the zoo: for instance, the figure-of-the-beloved in the zoo, who may or may not be an idealized representation of some beloved in the real world, though for Freud she is more likely to be a heavily disguised version of a parent.\n Let us take the example of a kind of writing that is, in its essence, a transaction with some such figure of the beloved, that tries to please her (but that also tries continually though surreptitiously to revise and recreate her as the-one-who-will-be-pleased); and let us imagine what happens if into this transaction is introduced in a massive and undeniable way another figure-of-the-reader: the dark-suited, bald-headed censor, with his pursed lips and his red pen and his irritability and his censoriousness (for no good reason I present the censor as a rather parodic version of the figure-of-the- father). Then the entire balance of the carefully constructed inner drama is destroyed, and destroyed in a way that is hard to repair. For, as is the way with these psychic operations, the more one tries to ignore (repress) the censor, the larger he swells.\n Working under a censorship regime is like being intimate with someone who does not love you, with whom you don\u2019t want intimacy, but who is forced upon you. It is like writing for an intrusive reader, one who forces himself in upon the intimacy of the writing transaction, forces out the figure of the loved or courted reader, reads whatever you write in a disapproving and censorious fashion.\n I cite an exemplary case from the Soviet Union, the case of one of Stalin\u2019s principal victims among writers, Osip Mandelstam. It tells several important and appalling lessons about the paranoid state.  3\n In 1933 Mandelstam, then 42 years old, composed a short but powerful poem about a tyrant who orders executions left, right and center, and relishes the deaths of his victims like a man munching raspberries. Though the tyrant is not named (he is identified only as a Georgian), the reference is clearly to Stalin.\n Mandelstam did not write the poem down, but did recite it several times to friends. In 1934 his home was raided by security police looking for the poem. Though they did not find it\u2014it existed solely inside the heads of the poet and his friends\u2014they arrested Mandelstam. While Mandelstam was under arrest, the poet Boris Pasternak had a telephone call from the top man himself, Stalin. Who is this fellow Mandelstam? Stalin wanted to know. In particular, is he a master? (That was Stalin\u2019s word, the same in Russian as in English.)\n Pasternak correctly inferred the second half of the question: Is Mandelstam a master or is he disposable? Pasternak replied, in effect, that Mandelstam was a master, that he was not disposable. So Mandelstam was sentenced to internal exile in the city of Voronezh. While he was living there, enormous pressure was brought on him to pay tribute to Stalin by composing a poem in his honour. Mandelstam gave in and composed an adulatory ode. What he felt about this ode we will never know, not only because he left no record but because\u2014as his wife persuasively argues\u2014he was mad when he wrote it, mad with fear, perhaps, but mad too with the madness of a person not only suffering the embrace of a body he detests, but taking the initiative, day after day, line after line, to embrace that body.\n In fact the ode did not save Mandelstam. He was soon rearrested and sent to a labour camp, from which he never returned. There is a great deal that can be said about the fate of this great and tragic poet. All I will comment on are two moments in his persecution: the moment when Stalin asks whether Mandelstam is a master, and the moment when Mandelstam is ordered to celebrate his persecutor.\n \u201cIs he a master?\u201d We can be sure Stalin was not asking because he regarded great artists as above the state. What he meant was something like, Is he dangerous? Is he going to live, even if he dies? Is his sentence on me going to live longer than my sentence on him? Do I have to be careful?\n Hence the command later on that Mandelstam write an ode (whether the command came from Stalin himself or from the toadies surrounding him need not concern us here). Making the great artists of his day kowtow to him was Stalin\u2019s way of breaking them, of making it impossible for them to hold their heads up\u2014in effect, of showing them who was master, and of making them acknowledge him as master in a medium where no lie, no private reservation, is possible: one\u2019s own art.\n To the case of Mandelstam let me add a case from South Africa that is comparable in its dynamic if not in its scale.  4\n In 1972 the poet Breyten Breytenbach published a poem in Afrikaans entitled \u201cLetter to Butcher from Foreign Parts.\u201d As the poem made clear, the butcher to whom the letter was addressed was Balthazar John Vorster, then Prime Minister of the Republic of South Africa, the man who had done most to create a security-police empire with huge powers over life and death, a police force untouchable by the law, above the courts. Vorster did more than anyone to create an ethos of invulnerability among the police, an ethos whose terrible aftereffects still hang over South Africa. In the custody of Vorster\u2019s security police, scores of political detainees died unexplained deaths. It is important to remember that these people did not \u201cdisappear,\u201d as happened in Argentina and Chile. On the contrary, their bodies were produced for post-mortem examination; and, despite clear evidence that they had died under torture, patriotic or perhaps just frightened magistrates accepted the bland explanations produced by the police: that detainees had slipped on bars of soap and fatally concussed themselves while taking a shower, or had hurled themselves out of tenth-floor windows in tits of remorse, or had hanged themselves with their torn-up shirts.\n In Breytenbach\u2019s long poem there are recorded the names of many of these victims, as if the poem says of itself, \u201cIt is I that will live in history, that will be remembered, not the court record.\u201d But the heart of the poem is a passage addressed to the butcher himself in which Breytenbach asks Vorster in the most intimate of ways what it is like for him to use fingers red with blood to fondle his wife\u2019s private parts. It is a shocking and obscene passage, all the more obscene for addressing the sex-life of a couple in late middle age, public figures in a highly puritanical society.\n Some years later, Breytenbach\u2014who had been living abroad when he wrote the poem, and had published it in the Netherlands, publication back home being out of the question\u2014paid a visit to South Africa, using false papers and on a secret military assignment. He was soon picked up by the security police. He was not liquidated, he was not even tortured, but he was given a show trial. The formal charge was terrorism, but his writings, particularly the poem against Vorster, soon emerged as a subtext to the proceedings. The purpose of the trial, as it emerged, was to break him in much the same way as Mandelstam had been broken. In open court Breytenbach ultimately apologized to Vorster for what he called the \u201ccrass and insulting\u201d poem he had written and thanked the security police for the humanity with which they had treated him. In return for eating crow he got nothing. The deal he had been promised\u2014a lighter sentence\u2014was reneged on.\n There is a puzzling feature about both cases, Brcytenbach\u2019s and Mandelstam\u2019s. Compared with the vast machinery of the state, including its well-developed machinery of censorship, the writer was clearly powerless. Yet the state, and particularly the head of state (the head of the state in which the paranoia buzzes), deemed these writers, these master-writers, important enough in terms of their power\u2014and power is the only quantity that power understands\u2014to lavish much attention on. Why could the two poems in question, however insulting, not have been ignored like the pinpricks they were? Why do the activities of writers concern the state at all?\n To answer this question, to understand the long history of troubled relations between writers and the state, we need to reflect on authorship as an historical phenomenon cradled in the early modern age, and on the ambitions opened up for the first time in history by a career in authorship.\n Scribal culture, the culture of the West before the invention of printing, did not particularly foster the notion that by dint of writing a person could attain fame. This notion belongs to print culture. We begin to see evidence of it quite soon after the invention of printing, as printers begin to make a practice of attaching authors\u2019 names to the books they put out. What does this signing of the book mean? Of course it has legal and commercial implications: the author accepts a share of the legal responsibility for the book as he lays claim to a share of the profits.  5 But signing the book also has a symbolic meaning: the author uses the book as a vehicle for projecting his signature\u2014and sometimes his portrait\u2014into the world, in a multiplied form. It is this potentially endless multiplication of traces of himself that gives the author the sense of having the power to cross all spatial and temporal boundaries. In visions of fame and immortality authorship as we know it today is born: authorship and the mystique of the author.  6\n  The people, as a concept in the political philosophy of the West, also goes back to the early modern state. The question may be McLuhanesque, but it is worth asking nevertheless: Which achieved its aims earlier\u2014the state, fitting the concept of a people over the population under its control, or the early printer-publishers, creating a public (a reading public) for their products? Or, to put the question in a milder form: Does the reading public called into being by the invention of printing not constitute a model of the people as imagined in the philosophy of the early modern state?\n Whatever the answer, it seems to be no accident that, as soon as printing arrived, state censorship took on a more systematic, widespread and rigorous form, as though in printers and their authors the state had identified not so much an enemy (though in fact that is what they were often labeled) as a rival. From the sixteenth century onward we begin to detect in the language of the state, when it turns to authors and their powers, a note of distinctly modern paranoia. Here, for instance, is England\u2019s Lord Keeper, Sir Nicholas Bacon, speaking in 1567:\n These books\u2026 [make] men\u2019s minds to be at variance one with another, and diversity of minds maketh seditions, seditions bring in tumults, tumults make insurrections and rebellions, insurrections make depopulations and bring in utter ruin and destruction of men\u2019s bodies, goods and lands.   7\n We tend today to think of blanket pre- and post-publication censorship as a feature of absolutist and totalitarian states: the Russia of Nicholas I, Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union. But censorship in early modern Europe was at least as relentless\u2014draconian in its penalties and surprisingly sophisticated in its mechanisms too.  8 As early as the sixteenth century we find the state viewing authors and printer-publishers not only as an interest group with a strong (and self-justifying) sense of\n......", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:59:12", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5ba1\u67e5,emerging,\u4f5c\u5bb6", "title": "\u6765\u81ea\u5ba1\u67e5\u751f\u7684\u65b0\u5174\uff081993\u5e74\uff09", "title_en": "Emerging from Censorship (1993)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://salmagundi.skidmore.edu/articles/9-emerging-from-censorship", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5ba1\u67e5", "emerging", "\u4f5c\u5bb6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fb508e6cf18e791c484b3c2c3c695664.png", "infoid": 1072461, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b63\u5728\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c5e\u4e8e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a1 2 3\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u95ee\u201c\u4f60\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22x y z\u5417\uff1f\u201d\u56e0\u4e3a1 2 3\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u95ee\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22x y z\u5417\uff1f\u201d\u3002", "note_en": "The code that is being reviewed belongs to, and is a product of, a team.

Judging from Hacker News, software engineers and Silicon Valley people don\u2019t always know this standard piece of economics. So!\n Voluntary economic transactions make all parties better off. But not all transactions are voluntary on all sides. If I take the car to work, saving $10 of time, I may cause 10 cents worth of pollution to 1000 people in my neighbourhood. Even though society would be $90 better off if I didn\u2019t drive, those people can\u2019t stop me. My driving is a public bad. Another classic example is overfishing. If everyone can fish from a lake, they will not take account of the cost they impose on others by leaving less fish for them. The lake is a commons.  Elinor Ostrom won her Nobel Prize for studying how communities solve these common pool dilemmas.\n  Computers get faster and have more memory every year. Your computer is many times more powerful than one from 10 years ago. Yet these improvements don\u2019t always seem to translate into faster performance. Many common programs still take seconds to start, or they use gigabytes of memory, seemingly to do the same job they always did.\n Your computer\u2019s memory and processing power is a commons. Many different programs run simultaneously on it. Like a fisher on the lake, each software maker faces a trade-off: they can add features, which take up processing power and memory. The cost of this will be shared among all the programs on your computer. The software maker cares about making their program slower, but not about making other programs slower. (Most users are not tech-savvy enough to work out which programs slow the computer down.) The maker faces another trade-off: they can write faster, leaner software, but at a cost in development time and highly-paid engineers. They pay that cost alone, but the faster software benefits all the other programs on your computer. Again, lean software is a public good. The result is that programs are featureful, but bloated.\n  Firms are collections of people cooperating to produce something. Often, the interest of different divisions is not aligned. Division X works on feature Y. Feature Y may not actually be very useful: the product would be better, and bring in more revenue, without it. But getting rid of Y would mean shrinking division X. If the firm\u2019s leadership is not perfectly effective, division X may get its way, keeping the useless feature. The industry phrase for this is \u201cshipping your org chart\u201d.\n   Open source software licenses allow users to view and modify the source code for software, and to share their modifications. Open source software has some notable successes, most famously the Linux kernel which powers much of the internet and every Android smartphone. It also has problems. Open source authors suffer burnout from demanding users. Key pieces of software infrastructure are  underfunded, putting  security at risk.\n Companies can profit from selling open source software. But they know that a rival can take their code and resell it, effectively expropriating the development time they have put in. ( This  happens.) As a result, investment in open source software is like a public good. There are various imperfect workarounds for this, like selling extra closed-source features, or making money from consulting. In other cases, open source development is done by volunteers, out of altruism or personal passion, or so as to demonstrate their skills to possible employers. Again, this can work, but not perfectly, because altruism and personal passion do not perfectly track consumer demand. Open source hackers write many projects which are useful to hackers, but relatively few which are directly useful to Grandma.\n My point isn\u2019t to attack open source:  all software markets are imperfect, as we\u2019ve just seen. Thinking of open source as a public good can clarify the problems it faces.\n  Much modern software is delivered via the web. The frontend is written in languages like HTML, Javascript and CSS. These aren\u2019t developed by a company but by standards bodies. Anybody may write a web browser which uses them.\n These standards are big and complex. They include a way to display a  repeating elliptical gradient, for a web page styled like a tie-dye t-shirt; an HTML tag for  acronym, plus a completely different tag for  abbreviation. Yet they have notable gaps. On a modern smartphone, you can make a payment with a single finger press. After 25 years of the web, most payments still involve typing in a 16 digit number plus several other details \u2014 typically, yet mysteriously, stored on a separate piece of plastic. It took decades to develop  a standard method to show a video, or a  decent way to display things in rows and columns. And while nerds can write and host their own websites, there is no usable standard way for an ordinary person to author content.\n What explains these failings? The historical details are complex and fought over, but the fundamental issue is simple: open standards are a public good. Making video or payments easy in HTML benefits all the browser makers, and every website owner. By contrast, Apple takes a 30% cut whenever you pay for an iPhone app. Of course it\u2019ll make payment easy.\n  Indeed, a public goods problem can be fixed if a single agent has the power to enforce contributions. Classically, the government might tax your driving or enforce limits on overfishing. In the software world, monopolists can solve public goods problems. When Apple writes software for the iPhone, it has an incentive to minimize bloat, because it makes money from sales of the whole platform, not each individual program. For software that Apple won\u2019t write itself, it can provide a \u201cwalled garden\u201d App store. It takes a cut of the profits; it can also enforce some quality guarantees. Customers don\u2019t mind this, because Apple mitigates (some of) the public goods problems of bad software.\n Facebook lets ordinary people write content on the web and show it to their friends. It provides another platform. Instead of charging users, it extracts information from them and sells it to advertisers. Billions of people are prepared to pay this price.\n One web browser, Chrome, has an increasing share of the web browser market, and that browser\u2019s owner, Google, increasingly dominates the HTML standards-setting process. Effectively, the web might become Google\u2019s platform. Like Facebook, it profits from advertising. Google\u2019s monopoly is not, basically, the result of nefarious behaviour.

Some theorists and musicians claim that the 432 Hz tuning has better effects on the human body, but there are no scientific studies that support this hypothesis.\n To identify differences in vital parameters and perceptions after listening to music at different frequencies, 440 Hz versus 432 Hz.\n    Two sessions of music listening on different days. Both sessions used the same music (movie soundtracks) but tuned to 440 Hz on one day and 432 Hz on the other. Each session consisted of 20 min\u2019 listening.\n Vital parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), perceptions (physical and emotional sensations, for example fatigue and stress), levels of concentration during the listening session, and general satisfaction with the experience.\n 432 Hz tuned music was associated with a slight decrease of mean (systolic and diastolic) blood pressure values (although not significant), a marked decrease in the mean of heart rate (\u22124.79 bpm,  p\u202f=\u202f0.05) and a slight decrease of the mean respiratory rate values (1 r.a.,  p\u202f=\u202f0.06), compared to 440 Hz. The subjects were more focused about listening to music and more generally satisfied after the sessions in which they listened to 432 Hz tuned music.\n The data suggests that 432 Hz tuned music can decrease heart rate more than 440 Hz tuned music. The study results suggest repeating the experiment with a larger sample pool and introducing randomized controlled trials covering more clinical parameters.\n     One sentence summary: we listen to music tuned to 440 Hz but listening to 432 Hz tuned music can have a greater impact on human health.\n  View full text", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:57:27", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u97f3\u4e50,health,\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6", "title": "\u97f3\u4e50\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a440 Hz\uff0c\u4e0e432 Hz\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u6548\u679c", "title_en": "Music Tuned to 440 Hz versus 432 Hz and the Health Effects", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550830718302763", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u97f3\u4e50", "health", "\u97f3\u4e50\u5bb6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "44cc3c562cfb3896f12902316e131f35.png", "infoid": 1072457, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b64\u7c7b\u9501\u7cfb\u7edf\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bc6\u94a5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u6388\u4e88\u8fdb\u5165\u8bbe\u65bd\u6216\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u710a\u76d8\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6253\u5370\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u57fa\u672c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8f93\u5165\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5219\u5c06\u91ca\u653e\u95e8\u9501\u6216\u9501\u76f8\u5668\u3002\u67d0\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u7535\u6c60\u6216\u5c0f\u7535\u6d41\u6765\u89e3\u9501\u3002", "note_en": "Instead of a key, this type of lock system requires a numerical code to grant entry to a facility or property.

But what else will we lose when no-transaction shopping becomes the norm?\n   W elcome to the supermarkets of the future. They may look and feel like the supermarkets we are all used to \u2013 and stock the same bread, butter and bananas \u2013 but these shops are now fitted out with more than \u00a31m of the latest technology that their bosses promise will put an end to our biggest frustration (queueing) and our most persistent crime (shoplifting).\n Jill French, a legal secretary in her 30s, wearing a sharp navy suit and matching beret, has just left a Tesco Express on London\u2019s Holborn Viaduct empty-handed. It\u2019s coming up to 6.30pm on a Thursday and, like dozens of others, French has popped in for a few essentials on her way home. \u201cI just went in to grab pasta, milk and some broccoli,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there was such a queue I got frustrated and walked out.\u201d\n  An eight-minute walk away is another near-identical Tesco Express where there are no queues. This shop is the cleverest of all the 2,700 Tescos in the UK.\n There are no checkouts (self-scanning or traditional), no checkout assistants, and \u2013 in theory \u2013 no chance of shoplifting. This Tesco, called GetGo, is filled with thousands of cameras, weighted shelves and artificial-intelligence technology that watches your every move, figures out what you\u2019ve bought and bills you directly as you walk out.\n It\u2019s not just Tesco that is trialling these new \u201csmart\u201d supermarkets. Retailers across the UK, and the rest of the world, are racing to deploy rival technology. The model for all of them is similar.\n First, you must download an app, register a credit card and scan a QR code on your phone to enter through train station-style gates. Barriers prevent those without the app from entering the shop. Once inside, the technology follows you around the store recording every item you pick up (and put back). When you\u2019re done you just walk out and after a few minutes your phone alerts you as to how much you\u2019ve spent.\n The supermarkets say time-pressed, easily frustrated people are crying out for a better, hassle-free shopping experience, and if these trial stores are successful they will roll out the technology across the country.\n It\u2019s almost 74 years since the first British supermarket opened in Manor Park, east London. At this branch of the London Cooperative Society, customers could walk round the store and take items off the shelves by themselves. It was revolutionary. In the years before, shoppers had to present the shopkeeper at a counter with a list of items that their assistants would fetch. Choosing your own tomatoes was banned, and touching the products could lead to prosecution.\n As with many innovations, the \u201cself-service\u201d supermarket concept was exported from the US, where retail pioneer  Clarence Saunders opened Piggly Wiggly in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916. If you\u2019re wondering about the name, Saunders said it was named \u201cso people will ask that very question\u201d.\n Today all shops, big or small, follow a similar concept. But our retail needs are evolving.\n The days of \u201cthe big weekly shop\u201d are over, with Britons going to a supermarket at least twice a week, according to YouGov, while a growing minority admit to popping in more than twice a day.\n The new generation of AI stores is meant to respond to these changes, but are there dangers in tinkering with one of the last remaining social levellers?\n Supermarkets are more than just places to buy food; they provide a space for a daily mixing of people of different classes and backgrounds in our increasingly siloed world.\n  If AI takes over, will those without access to the latest smartphone be barred from the great supermarket melting pot? Will lonely older people lose their friendly chat with the cashier, which could be their only conversation of the day?\n Research backs up the retailers\u2019 hunch about our frustrations with shopping. A recent survey by packaging company DS Smith found that more than a third of 2,000 people polled would walk out of the store rather than wait five minutes in a checkout queue, and 46% said they were so irritated by queuing that they would consider not coming back to the shop again.\n Laura Saunter, a senior retail analyst at the consumer trends analytic firm WGSN, says supermarkets have spent years trying to bust queues because they are the customers\u2019 \u201cnumber one pain point\u201d.\n Many of us are now so impatient that waiting a few minutes for a checkout assistant to become free can feel like an unacceptable hassle in a world where technology dominates and instant gratification is expected.\n  \u201cThese stores are positioned at millennial parents who are busy; they want to be in and out, they don\u2019t want to waste their time,\u201d Saunter says. And younger people, generation Z, just don\u2019t want to interact with store staff.\u201d\n Tesco has already tested the technology at its employee-only supermarket in Welwyn Garden City for more than a year. Amazon has 15 stores that use similar technology, including one almost directly across the street from the Tesco on Holborn.\n The supermarkets\u2019 analytics teams seem to have a thing for the central London neighbourhood with Sainsbury\u2019s also opening a trial smart supermarket on the same street in late November.\n The race is on. Aldi is preparing to open a similar smart store in Greenwich, south London. Morrisons is testing its own vision of the technology, codenamed Project Sarah, at its Bradford headquarters, and plans to quickly roll out dozens of small stores at busy locations.\n Another two of the Amazon stores opened in Chingford and East Sheen shortly before Christmas. A recent leak of internal documents reveals that these are just baby steps on to the UK high street for Amazon, which was founded by the world\u2019s second-richest person, Jeff Bezos, in 1995 and is now the second-largest retailer on the planet, collecting sales of more than $1.2bn (\u00a3900m) every day.\n The internet giant is planning to open about 60 more UK stores next year, followed by 100 in 2023 and another 100 in 2024, according to a report by the blog  Business Insider. Amazon has long been accused of attempting to kill off the high street by encouraging us all to buy almost everything online. But could its desire to now open bricks-and-mortar stores revitalise our urban centres?\n All of the supermarkets say the technology is designed to make shoppers\u2019 lives easier, but experts say the real desire is to improve their bottom line as they can cut back on the wage bill and save some of the \u00a35.5bn lost every year to shoplifting and employee theft.\n The most frequently stolen items from UK stores include spirits, sirloin steaks, razor blades, cosmetics, infant formula and batteries, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Cheese also makes the top 10, with posh bries and aged camembert often stolen to order by restaurants.\n Retailers in Scandinavia are ahead of the UK, opening shops without checkout assistants, security guards or any other members of staff present. Instead, customers use their phones to open the doors of shipping container-like stores, shop completely alone and walk out to the beep of the bill notification on their phone.\n In less than three years, Stockholm-based start-up  Lifvs has opened 29 of the tiny stores in remote villages across Sweden, which in some instances had lost their last corner shops decades ago. Giulia Ray, a beekeeper in the village of Veckholm, 60 miles east of Stockholm, said the opening of the Lifvs \u201cshopping box\u201d added to rather than took away from community spirit. \u201cYou go inside and get something, and maybe someone else is here and you can have a chat,\u201d she says as she picks up essentials and restocks the shelves with her own honey at the same time.\n While fitting out supermarkets with the new technology costs about \u00a31m-per-store, the firms installing it claim it will pay for itself within 18 months because it will hopefully eliminate theft. \u201cWith this technology, you can\u2019t really steal, we know who is in the store and we know where all the products are,\u201d says Yair Holtzer, who helped develop the technology for Trigo, an Israeli firm that fitted out the Tesco store, and is working with other major retailers across the world.\n \u201cWith these systems it cuts out not just shoplifting but also mistakes, errors and employee fraud,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are problems that all retailers have, and could be solved.\u201d\n  Supermarkets lose about 1.4% of their combined \u00a3200bn annual revenue to \u201cshrinkage\u201d \u2013 industry code for customer or employee theft and admin errors.\n Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the CRR, says supermarkets thought they had found a solution to queue frustration and high wage bills with the introduction of self-scanning machines that were rolled out in the early 2000s and are now ubiquitous. \u201cBut it is very easy for customers to skip a few items through without scanning the barcode,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to get away with things that you wouldn\u2019t be able to at a staffed till.\u201d\n Probe a little, and even the most upstanding friends and acquaintances have a shoplifting tale \u2013 from the south London primary school teacher who makes a point of stealing one item in every shop to the writer who was tapped on the shoulder by a security guard who\u2019d seen her tap the screen for one banana when she bagged two.\n A study by the University of Leicester\u2019s criminology department found that theft from stores with self-checkout machines was between 33 and 147% higher than those with only traditional checkouts. The researchers also found that the number of self-checkout machines available to use was correlated to the level of theft.\n In response, shops have cut down on the number of self-checkout machines available per staff member which, Bamfield says, explains why supermarkets often annoyingly place out-of-order stickers on working terminals.\n Supermarkets, including Tesco, have also begun installing screens on self-checkouts showing a livestream of customers scanning their items. \u201cThey\u2019re reminding you that every action you take is being filmed,\u201d says Bamfield. \u201cIt\u2019s like the shop saying, \u2018Are you sure you want to steal?\u2019\u201d\n It\u2019s not just customers who steal. Bamfield\u2019s research shows that about \u00a31.4bn a year is lost to shoplifting, followed closely by \u00a31.3bn in employee theft. The new technology is designed to tackle that, too.\n \u201cIt might not seem so obvious, but a big proportion of theft is due to staff on the take, and by removing staff from tills this technology will eliminate that loss,\u201d he says.\n Bamfield believes the most common technique staff use to steal is referred to in the industry as \u201cthe switcheroo\u201d.\n \u201cAn uncle will say to his cashier nephew, \u2018I\u2019m coming into the store tomorrow afternoon and I\u2019d like a discount,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen the uncle comes to the checkout, the nephew will have a barcode sticker for a watermelon or orange or something on his palm and while pretending to scan the uncle\u2019s bottles of scotch whisky the nephew will scan the watermelon sticker.\u201d\n Bamfield, who has spent a career working with retailers, and has written a book on shoplifting (Waterstones describes his 2012 title  Shopping and Crime as \u201can interdisciplinary study of retail crime as a cultural phenomenon\u201d), isn\u2019t sure the new checkout-free supermarkets will succeed in eliminating shoplifting altogether.\n  \u201cI was at a retail conference in Norwich, and one of the speakers flashed up a picture of one of these new stores and said, \u2018Well, that is the end of shoplifting.\u2019\n But, we just don\u2019t know yet how good this technology will be at reducing theft.\u201d\n Shoplifting, which was first documented in the 16th century, began soaring in 2014 after the law was changed to define \u201clow-value shoplifting\u201d as a summary offence. This means that police forces can decide not to investigate thefts from shops of goods worth less than \u00a3200.\n Anyone caught stealing less than \u00a3200-worth of goods can still be arrested and face prosecution, but the 2014 antisocial behaviour, crime and policing act allows them to plead guilty by post. Police in England and Wales recorded 374,000 incidents of shoplifting in 2019 (the latest figures available), up from 317,000 in 2013, before the law changed.\n Retailers have responded with more technology. Sainsbury\u2019s is experimenting with machine-learning \u201cconcealment detector\u201d technology to monitor and record when shoppers place an item in their pocket and alert in-store security guards in real time.\n Sainsbury\u2019s says its 30-store trial partnership with UK artificial intelligence startup ThirdEye has helped cut theft from its spirits aisles by 47%. Razwan Ghafoor, co-founder and chief executive of ThirdEye, says the technology helps make CCTV smarter.\n \u201cYou can have hundreds of cameras in a store, but which feed should you be watching?\u201d Ghafoor says on the phone from Heathrow as he boards a plane to New York the day after selling ThirdEye to larger rival Standard AI for millions of pounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve taught the system to learn when someone picks up an item and pockets it. The system will flag it and send a four-second clip to a human to investigate. It means the security team can watch a lot less footage and concentrate on the footage they need to watch.\u201d\n No queues, less shoplifting, lower wage bills: the benefits of this new generation of hi-tech supermarkets are clear. But campaigners are concerned they represent another step in the UK\u2019s march towards an \u201ceveryday surveillance society\u201d.\n \u201cGoing to the supermarket is one of the most mundane, everyday things we do. The fact that surveillance and data gathering in such a space is being normalised is deeply troubling,\u201d says Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns officer at human rights group Liberty. \u201cShopping should be one of the great levellers, where the businessman in the sharp suit is shoulder-to-shoulder with the pensioner on benefits. Everyone has to buy food, but with this technology only those with a smartphone and credit cards will be able to shop there.\u201d\n In the near term, the biggest losers from this technological revolution are likely to be Britain\u2019s army of 270,000 checkout workers, most of whom are women. The pandemic has already hit retail workers hard, with some 190,000 jobs lost since the start of the first lockdown in March 2020. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has identified supermarket cashier jobs as among the most at risk of being replaced by automation, with 65% of checkout-operator jobs said to be in peril.\n \u201cThe checkout-free technology is specifically designed to eliminate jobs, and save money,\u201d says  Dr Carl Benedikt Frey, an Oxford University economist and expert on automation whose research the ONS statistics are based on. Up to 47% of all jobs could be done by machines \u201cover the next decade or two\u201d, he believes. Frey predicts that checkout workers are likely to be among the first to lose their jobs to the robots, alongside bar staff, farm workers and sewing machinists.\n Supermarkets have offered stable employment to generations of Britons excluded from higher-skilled roles, providing modest but reliable incomes \u2013 and the prospect of advancement \u2013 in communities blighted by manufacturing decline.\n Frey fears that a national rollout of AI stores would send the checkout worker the same way as the elevator operator, which as of today is the only one of 270 job descriptions listed in the 1950 US census to be completely eliminated by automation.\n \u201cWe think this coming change is unprecedented, but actually what is happening mirrors what we saw in the Industrial Revolution and hollowing out of middle-income jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe technology is very different, but the effects on the economy are quite similar.\u201d\n Back in that Holborn Tesco, among the familiar daily groceries, a change is coming that could herald the biggest revolution in how we shop for groceries since the opening of the first supermarket on 12 January 1948. Like their predecessors, the smart supermarkets are said to be designed to make our lives easier. But is it time to allow the shop assistant to follow the elevator operator into obsolescence, or could we all learn to wait a little longer and enjoy a friendly chat at the checkout?", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:55:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8d85\u5e02,supermarkets,\u6280\u672f", "title": "\u667a\u80fd\u8d85\u5e02\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u7ed3\u675f\u5417\uff1f", "title_en": "Do smart supermarkets herald the end of shopping as we know it?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/do-smart-supermarkets-herald-the-end-of-shopping-as-we-know-it", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d85\u5e02", "\u6280\u672f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ef6abc1be8f2f3b35838a55416b7be81.png", "infoid": 1072453, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u7ed9\u4e86\u6211\u4e00\u79cd\u611f\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8981\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u522b\u662f\u201c\u5206\u5e03\u201d\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u672c\u8eab\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ea\u662f\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002 \u201c\u5206\u5e03\u56e0\u7d20\u201d\u662f\u6307\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u903b\u8f91/\u6743\u9650\u66f4\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u751f\u547d\uff1a\u5728\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u4e2d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u201c\u96c6\u4e2d\u201d\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefAPI\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u751a\u81f3\u6ca1\u6709\u7b7e\u7f72\u3002\n\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u662f\u641e\u7b11\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u88ab\u9732\u73e0\u88ab\u53d6\u6d88\u4e86\u3002\u6211\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u662f\uff0c\u5f62\u8c61\u53d8\u5316\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u9a97\u5c40\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5Opensea\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a97\u5c40\u3002\n\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u4f7f\u7528OpenSea\u83b7\u5f97Opensea\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u90a3\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5728\u94fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u8ba2\u5355\u4e0a\u7684\u94fe\u6761\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4f1a\u5f88\u9177\u3002\n\u8fd9\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u4f60\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7b2c2\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8c22\u5929opensea\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u6211\u4eb2\u81ea\u5e0c\u671bZK-rollups\u771f\u6b63\u4f7f\u5b83\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\n\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u652f\u4ed8\u4e00\u5207\u8d39\u7528\u3002\u6211\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u81ea\u5df1\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u94c6\u63a5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d4c\u6ce8\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u6765\u652f\u4ed8\u975eWeb3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u542c\u5230\u522b\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9Web2\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528Web3\u3002 DM ME\uff01", "note_en": "Both gave me a feeling for how the space works. To be clear, there is nothing particularly \u201cdistributed\u201d about the apps themselves: they\u2019re just normal react websites. The \u201cdistributedness\u201d refers to where the state and the logic/permissions for updating the state lives: on the blockchain instead of in a \u201ccentralized\u201d database.\n Just to clarify, this is what the author wanted to do. You can create distributed apps easily using  Fleek or by manually uploading to IPFS, Arweave or Filecoin.\n A server! But, as we know, people don\u2019t want to run their own servers. As it happens, companies have emerged that sell API access to an ethereum node they run as a service, along with providing analytics, enhanced APIs they\u2019ve built on top of the default ethereum APIs, and access to historical transactions. Which sounds\u2026 familiar. At this point, there are basically two companies. Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain. In fact, even when you connect a wallet like MetaMask to a dApp, and the dApp interacts with the blockchain via your wallet, MetaMask is just making calls to Infura!\n This is true at the moment, but there is work being done on  Light Clients which:\n The purpose of the light client protocol is to allow users in low-capacity environments (embedded smart property environments, smartphones, browser extensions, some desktops, etc) to maintain a high-security assurance about the current state of some particular part of the Ethereum state or verify the execution of a transaction.\n And also alternatives to Infura such as  Pockt Network which is a decentralised Web3 infrastructure company. Per Pockt Network\u2019s website:\n Instead of deploying to a single service provider, paying absurd fees for random outages and leaked data, tap into Pocket\u2019s trustless API protocol and route your requests to 1000\u2019s of independent full nodes. Available for all major blockchain networks.\n  These client APIs are not using anything to verify blockchain state or the authenticity of responses. The results aren\u2019t even signed.\n   Partisans of the blockchain might say that it\u2019s okay if these types of centralized platforms emerge, because the state itself is available on the blockchain, so if these platforms misbehave clients can simply move elsewhere. However, I would suggest that this is a very simplistic view of the dynamics that make platforms what they are.I also wanted to create a more traditional NFT. Most people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain.\n This is true, most NFTs do not store data on-chain. But this is not always true, you can store the data on the chain. You can also use alternative layer-1s such as  Tezos,  https://www.avax.network/ which makes it much more cost efficient to store on-chain data. However, I am not a fan of this. One of the big rebuttals we don\u2019t have an answer for is \u201cwhat if we store illegal images on the chain?\u201d currently it is too expensive to do so, but genuinely there is no work being done on this that I can see and it is a concern for everyone.\n You also have to consider sending NFTs to other people that are prohibitively expensive to sell. You can easily make an NFT that costs say, $4000 to sell (just make it contain a lot of data) and this person will be stuck with it attached to their identity forever. Opensea lets you \u201chide\u201d them, but this only works on their frontend.\n Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere.\n This is a lie. Most NFTs which sell for millions use IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin or others for decentralised storage of data. A lot of NFTs do use Google Drive or Imgur or whatever. However, I can promise you that one of the first things people do when making sure they are not rugged (crypto-term for scammed) is to make sure it\u2019s not possible for the author to suddenly delete or change the image.\n So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester.\n I just wanted to point out that this was hilarious and I saw it was taken down by Opensea. My belief is that image changing is often related to scams, so Opensea took it down thinking it was a scam.\n What I found most interesting, though, is that after OpenSea removed my NFT, it also no longer appeared in any crypto wallet on my device.A wallet like MetaMask needs to do basic things like display your balance, your recent transactions, and your NFTs, as well as more complex things like constructing transactions, interacting with smart contracts, etc. In short, MetaMask needs to interact with the blockchain, but the blockchain has been built such that clients like MetaMask can\u2019t interact with it. So like my dApp, MetaMask accomplishes this by making API calls to three companies that have consolidated in this space.All this means that if your NFT is removed from OpenSea, it also disappears from your wallet. It doesn\u2019t functionally matter that my NFT is indelibly on the blockchain somewhere, because the wallet (and increasingly everything else in the ecosystem) is just using the OpenSea API to display NFTs, which began returning 304 No Content for the query of NFTs owned by my address!\n This is true, wallets suck so much it\u2019s funny. I was sent a \u00a32k NFT the other day which I can\u2019t sell because Opensea has glitched and my wallet won\u2019t show me the NFT, which means I can\u2019t send it or sell it! (they are working on this, and I have told them that relying on centralised Opensea is a very bad idea).\n Almost everyone in Web3 hates Opensea and their centralised mess. There are alternatives being worked on such as  OpenDao,  NFTX and more. The sooner Opensea dies, the better.\n I think this is a very fair comment from Moxie and we should dunk on wallets and Opensea for this mess they\u2019ve created. However, I wanted to point out that people in Web3 don\u2019t sit idly by and enjoy this centralised mess. We are actively building alternatives!\n Likewise, the web3 protocols are slow to evolve. When building First Derivative, it would have been great to price minting derivatives as a percentage of the underlying\u2019s value. That data isn\u2019t on chain, but it\u2019s in an API that OpenSea will give you.\n This is how markets work, and why arbitrage exists. See  Flash Boys for how this works in the stock market. Your NFT is only worth what someone wants to pay. Someone on Opensea may pay 5 eth for it, but someone on Discord may pay 10 eth.\n You chose to use Opensea to get the value of what people on Opensea will pay you for. That data isn\u2019t on chain because that\u2019s not how markets work, although it\u2019d be cool if every market place used the same market-order book on-chain.\n People are excited about NFT royalties for the way that can benefit creators, but royalties aren\u2019t specified in ERC-721\n You\u2019re right, royalties are specified in  ERC-2981. I would also like to point out that ERC-721 is not the only NFT standard, take a look at  ERC-1155 if you wanted to dive deeper :-)\n so OpenSea has its own way of configuring royalties that exists in web2 space. Iterating quickly on centralized platforms is already outpacing the distributed protocols and consolidating control into platforms.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s early days still\u201d is the most common refrain I see from people in the web3 space when discussing matters like these. In some ways, cryptocurrency\u2019s failure to scale beyond relatively nascent engineering is what makes it possible to consider the days \u201cearly,\u201d since objectively it has already been a decade or more.\n This is because it is early days, still. As you could read from my article there is so much work being done. NFTs are only 3 years old. Layer 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s are arguably only around a year old.\n When you think about it, OpenSea would actually be much \u201cbetter\u201d in the immediate sense if all the web3 parts were gone. It would be faster, cheaper for everyone, and easier to use.For example, to accept a bid on my NFT, I would have had to pay over $80-$150+ just in ethereum transaction fees.\n This sounds like you\u2019re describing a  layer-2 solution, thankfully Opensea supports polygon which does make it cheaper, faster, and easier to use. I am personally hoping for  zk-rollups to really make it cheaper, easier to use.\n I will say we shouldn\u2019t strive for \u201ccheaper\u201d, we should strive for \u201cso cheap its free\u201d. Opensea lets you mint NFTs for free using Polygon. The benefits of fully decentralised technologies without the downside of a microtransaction at every aspect of it. I talk more about this later.\n So the money draws people into OpenSea, they improve the experience by building a platform that iterates on the underlying web3 protocols in web2 space, they eventually offer the ability to \u201cmint\u201d NFTs through OpenSea itself instead of through your own smart contract, and eventually this all opens the door for Coinbase to offer access to the validated NFT market with their own platform via your debit card. That opens the door to Coinbase managing the tokens themselves through dark pools that Coinbase holds, which helpfully eliminates the transaction fees and makes it possible to avoid having to interact with smart contracts at all. Eventually, all the web3 parts are gone, and you have a website for buying and selling JPEGS with your debit card. The project can\u2019t start as a web2 platform because of the market dynamics, but the same market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization will likely drive it to end up there.\n Moxie is right about this currently. It is harder to use true web3 stuff than it is to use a centralised platform. The user experience of Web3 is its biggest problem, and something we are all working very hard on. Things like  Argent Wallet are working hard to improve this, but we still have a long way to go because we are in the early days.\n  I think was this a fair article that accurately portrays some parts of web3 at this given moment in time. Moxie mentions:\n  Which is fair. I just thought I\u2019d write this and explain what\u2019s being done to fix this and go further. My personal pet hates for crypto are:\n Illegal images being sent to your wallet, forcing you to go to prison in some places.\n  Every user will have to pay for everything. I am actually working on this myself, I think staking and using the proceeds from staking to pay for non-web3 users would work. I\u2019m interested to hear how others are letting web2 users use web3 without paying.  DM me!\n There is some genuinely cool tech being worked on here, but due to the monetrary aspect there are scams up to my eyeballs. And those scams make the whole industry look bad. I think Moxie focussed on the NFT side too much which is arguably the side with the most scams / problems. There\u2019s still a lot of genuinely cool technology that exists  outside of NFTs.\n   You also need to realise that Web3 is world-wide, not just America or Europe. Some countries have unstable currencies and to use USD you need to pay a hefty fee. Web3 lets them have the safety of USD without this fee. Or you can use decentralised finance to invest, bank or do other things not available to you. You can earn money in pay-2-earn games, a lot more than you could with a job in some countries.\n A lot of people who criticise Web3 come from a privileged position and do not see it benefitting them. It does, however, benefit everyone else in the world.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:54:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u56de\u7b54,impressions,opensea", "title": "\u56de\u7b54\u6211\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5370\u8c613", "title_en": "In Response to My first impressions of Web3", "transed": 1, "url": "https://skerritt.blog/response-to-moxie/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56de\u7b54", "opensea"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2c78658e363649cb9b032c7e00ce9414.png", "infoid": 1072452, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u653f\u5e9c\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u5371\u5bb3\u996e\u98df\u548c\u996e\u9152\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u5b83\u4ee4\u4eba\u8033\u76ee\u4e00\u65b0\uff08\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\uff09\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5c0a\u91cd\u7684\u98df\u54c1\u4f5c\u5bb6\u8fd1\u671f\uff0c\u201c\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u5bb3\u6015\u7ec6\u83cc\u201d\u3002\n\u6211\u627f\u8ba4\u8981\u8fdd\u53cd\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5236\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u51e0\u5929\u3002\u5f53\u6211\u716e\u4e00\u4e2a\u665a\u9910\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u5e9f\u6599\u548c\u9aa8\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u6e05\u7406\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u7168\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6211\u4e0a\u5e8a\u7761\u89c9\u524d\u62ff\u51fa\u9505\u3002\u5728\u90a3\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u70ed\u80a1\u6709\u592a\u9ebb\u70e6\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728\u51b0\u7bb1\u91cc\u52a0\u70ed\u90bb\u5c45\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6211\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u9505\uff0c\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u7559\u4e0b\u5b83\uff0c\u65e9\u4e0a\u518d\u52a0\u70ed\uff0c\u5728\u7d27\u5f20\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u548c\u5236\u51b7\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5927\u7ea6\u516b\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u6211\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba9\u6211\u6216\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u751f\u75c5\u3002\n\u6b63\u5982\u65af\u5948\u5fb7\u535a\u58eb\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u201c\u5750\u5728\u7089\u5b50\u548c\u751f\u957f\u7ec6\u83cc\u540e\u4e24\u4e09\u5929\u540e\uff0cRuhlman\u7684\u5e93\u5b58\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u6709\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4f20\u67d3\u6027\u68ad\u83cc\u7ec6\u80de\uff0c\u6216\u8089\u6bd2\u6746\u83cc\u6216\u82bd\u5b62\u6746\u83cc\u6216\u82bd\u5b62\u6746\u83cc\u7ec6\u80de\u53ca\u5176\u6bd2\u7d20\uff0c\u6216\u4e00\u4e9b\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u201c\n\u50cf\u8089\u7c7b\u5e93\u5b58\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6e7f\u6da6\u7684\u98df\u7269\u90fd\u6613\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u5b58\u8005\u7ec6\u83cc\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u6e17\u900f\u3002 \uff08\u70d8\u7119\u98df\u54c1\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u7ec6\u83cc\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5e72\u71e5;\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u6a21\u5177\u6240\u635f\u574f\u3002\uff09\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u8be5\u907f\u514d\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u51c6\u5907\u6d3e\u5bf9\u6216\u5047\u671f\u76db\u5bb4\u65f6\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u716e\u719f\u7684\u98df\u7269\uff08\u6216\u4eab\u53d7\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u61d2\u60f0 - UPS\uff09\u6216\u8005\u91ce\u9910\u6216\u4e3a\u5e7c\u513f\u6253\u5305\u5348\u9910\u76d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8001\u4eba\u548c\u751f\u75c5\u7684\u5e7c\u513f\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u6700\u597d\u8ba9\u6f6e\u6e7f\u7684\u5348\u9910\u7269\u54c1\u5bd2\u51b7\u6216\u70ed\uff0c\u5305\u56f4\u51b7\u85cf\u5305\u6216\u70ed\u6c34\u74f6\u3002\n\u65af\u5948\u5fb7\u535a\u58eb\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u5269\u83dc\u9732\u51fa\u5e76\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u6bd4\u4e24\u82f1\u5bf8\u539a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u4eec\u5f88\u5feb\u51c9\u723d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u70ed\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728\u53f0\u9762\u4e0a\u5f00\u59cb\u51b7\u5374\u3002\u5f53\u5bb9\u5668\u4e0d\u518d\u70ed\u5230\u89e6\u6478\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b83\u653e\u5165\u51b0\u7bb1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u98df\u7269\u597d\u51b7\u5374\u3002", "note_en": "PEPPERED as we are by government warnings about the potential health hazards of eating and drinking just about everything, it was refreshing (and perplexing) to see a widely respected food writer assert recently that \u201cpeople are unnecessarily afraid of bacteria\u201d in the kitchen.\n In April, Michael Ruhlman, author of \u201cRatio\u201d and \u201cThe Elements of Cooking\u201d and co-author of books by Thomas Keller and other chefs, said on his  blog that  he likes to make chicken stock and leave it out on the stovetop all week, using portions day to day to make quick soups and sauces.\n But what about the harmful microbes that could grow on foods if they were not kept either chilled or hot? \u201cOnce your stock is cooked, it\u2019s safe to eat,\u201d Mr. Ruhlman wrote. \u201cIf there were bad bacteria in it, you\u2019d have killed them.\u201d After the stock has cooled, simply reheat it, he continued, and \u201cany bacteria that landed there and began to multiply will be dispatched well before the stock hits a simmer.\u201d\n Sounds plausible, and Mr. Ruhlman and his family are alive and well. But after checking with an independent expert on food safety, I wouldn\u2019t follow this recipe without slapping a biohazard label on my stockpot.\n  The Food and Drug Administration sets regulations for commercial food production. These specify that cooked foods should sit out at temperatures from 41 degrees to 135 degrees, the range in which bacteria can grow and multiply, for no more than four hours.\n Guidelines for the consumer and home cook, which come from the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, are even stricter. The current brochure,  \u201cKeep Food Safe! Food Safety Basics,\u201d on the U.S.D.A. Web site, says not to leave prepared foods in the bacterial growth zone for longer than two hours. And if it\u2019s a 90-degree summer day, cut the two hours to one.\n Mr. Ruhlman\u2019s stock spends days in the bacterial growth zone, and he happily makes it into chicken soup for his children.\n I\u2019ll admit to violating the guidelines in my own stock-making, though by a few hours, not days. When I cook a roast for dinner, I use leftover scraps and bones to start the stock, simmer it while I clean up, and take the pot off the heat right before I go to bed. At that point it\u2019s too much trouble to cool the hot stock so it won\u2019t warm up its neighbors in the refrigerator. Instead, I cover the pot, leave it at room temperature and reheat it in the morning, about eight hours later, before straining, cooling and refrigerating it. And my stock hasn\u2019t made me or my family ill, either.\n Can I be even more relaxed about my stock-making? Or have Mr. Ruhlman and I just been lucky? For an expert opinion, I sent our recipes to  O. Peter Snyder, a food scientist and veteran educator and consultant to the food-service industry, who has at times taken issue with government guidelines he considers unnecessarily conservative.\n  Dr. Snyder replied in an e-mail: \u201cThe process described by Mr. Ruhlman is a very high-risk procedure. It depends totally on reheating the stock before it is used to be sure that it doesn\u2019t make anyone ill or possibly kill them.\u201d\n It\u2019s a basic fact that every cook should know: bacteria that cause illness inevitably end up on nearly every ingredient we cook with, and even boiling won\u2019t kill all of them.\n Boiling does kill any bacteria active at the time, including E. coli and salmonella. But a number of survivalist species of bacteria are able to form inactive seedlike spores. These dormant spores are commonly found in farmland soils, in dust, on animals and field-grown vegetables and grains. And the spores can survive boiling temperatures.\n After a food is cooked and its temperature drops below 130 degrees, these spores germinate and begin to grow, multiply and produce toxins. One such spore-forming bacterium is Clostridium botulinum, which can grow in the oxygen-poor depths of a stockpot, and whose neurotoxin causes botulism.\n Once they\u2019ve germinated, bacteria multiply quickly in nourishing stock. They can double their numbers every 90 minutes at room temperature, every 15 minutes at body temperature. A single germinated spore can become 1,000 bacteria in a matter of hours, a billion in a few days.\n As Dr. Snyder put it, \u201cAfter sitting on the stove and growing bacteria for two or three days, Mr. Ruhlman\u2019s stock almost certainly has high levels of infectious Clostridium perfringens cells, or Clostridium botulinum or Bacillus cereus cells and their toxins, or some combination thereof.\u201d\n  Why has the Ruhlman family survived? Because Mr. Ruhlman boils the stock before he serves it, Dr. Snyder wrote. Any active bacteria are killed by holding the stock for a minute at 150 degrees or above, and botulism toxin is inactivated by 10 minutes at the boil.\n  But quickly reheating a contaminated stock just up to serving temperature won\u2019t destroy its active bacteria and toxins, and the stock will make people sick.\n \u201cIf Mr. Ruhlman ever has a cup of his three-day-old stock without thoroughly boiling it first, he will probably only do it once,\u201d Dr. Snyder wrote. \u201cIt is irresponsible of any cook to prepare food in a way that actually creates a new and significant hazard, even though the hazard may be eliminated in a later step.\u201d\n Safety is one problem with keeping a stock at room temperature. Flavor is another. A reboiled three-day-old stock may be safe to eat, but it is now seasoned with millions to billions of dead bacteria and their inactivated toxins. It\u2019s conceivable that they might add an interesting flavor, but more likely that the bacteria have feasted on the stock\u2019s sugars and savory amino acids, the air has oxidized and staled the fat, and the stock has become less tasty.\n I spoke with Mr. Ruhlman about Dr. Snyder\u2019s analysis of his stovetop-stored stock. \u201cI agree that I should have been clearer about the importance of the \u2018kill step,\u2019 a good 10 minutes at the boil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd certainly to make the freshest, cleanest stock, it\u2019s always best to strain, cool and chill it as rapidly as possible.\u201d\n What about my lazy method of letting stock cool overnight, then reboiling and refrigerating it first thing in the morning? Dr. Snyder gave it a pass because it would spend only a few hours below 135 degrees, not enough time for the bacterial spores to germinate, start growing and reach hazardous numbers.\n Like meat stocks, all moist cooked foods are susceptible to being recolonized by survivalist bacteria. (Baked goods are generally too dry for bacteria; they\u2019re spoiled by molds.) That\u2019s why we should avoid leaving cooked foods out at room temperature for long when we\u2019re preparing for a party or holiday feast (or enjoying their lazy follow-ups), or having a picnic, or packing lunch boxes for young children, who along with the elderly and ill are more vulnerable. It\u2019s best to keep moist lunch items either cold or hot, surrounded by cold packs or in a thermos.\n  What are the actual odds of getting sick from casual food handling at home? No one really knows. There are many variables involved, and only a small fraction of illnesses are reported, even to a family doctor, since they\u2019re usually brief. But one unambiguous and heartbreaking story can bring home the value of handling food carefully.\n In 2008, a 26-year-old Japanese mother in the Osaka region shared a meal of leftover fried rice with her two children, ages 1 and 2. She had prepared and served the rice the day before and kept it at room temperature.\n All three became ill 30 minutes after eating the leftovers, and were hospitalized. Both children lost consciousness, and the youngest died seven hours after the meal. Pathologists later reported in the journal Pediatrics that the rice contained a very common spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus cereus, along with a heat-resistant toxin that the bacterium tends to make on starchy foods, and that can cause vomiting even after being heated to the boil.\n It may be true that most cases of food-borne illness aren\u2019t that serious, and that most reported cases can be traced to foods that were contaminated during their production or processing. But it is also true that one simple mistake at home can be fatal.\n Even though I know this, I tend to discount specific government guidelines because they seem to change arbitrarily, and they don\u2019t seem workable in real life. This is true of the latest U.S.D.A. numbers. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect home cooks to chill or reheat or discard dishes every two hours during a dinner party, or every hour at a summer barbecue.\n Dr. Snyder agreed that official pronouncements on food safety can be inconsistent and self-defeating. \u201cThe F.D.A. Food Code is very conservatively written,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFour hours after it\u2019s cooked is plenty fast enough to get food into the refrigerator.\u201d And slow enough to relax and enjoy the meal.\n Dr. Snyder added that it\u2019s safest to cool leftovers uncovered and in a mass no thicker than two inches, so they cool through quickly. If they\u2019re still hot, start the cooling on the countertop. When the container is no longer hot to the touch, put it in the refrigerator, and cover it once the food is good and cold.\n  My own everyday approach to safety is to try to keep cooked foods either hot or cold until I\u2019m ready to serve them, get leftovers in the fridge during the pause before dessert or soon after, and reheat leftovers that need it until they\u2019re boiling or steaming.\n This set of habits isn\u2019t dictated by an unnecessary, pleasure-killing fear of microbes.

It appears to be a fragment of code, but it has no purpose in the boot sector and is never executed. So why is the sequence of junk bytes there, and where did it come from?\n The immediate answer is \u201cit came from FORMAT.COM\u201d. The junk is copied verbatim from FORMAT.COM to the boot sector. But those junk bytes are  not part of FORMAT.COM, either. So the question merely shifts to \u201cwhy are the junk bytes in FORMAT.COM, and where did they come from?\u201d\n It is not known if anyone answered the question in the past, but the answer has been found now, almost 40 years later\u2014twice independently.\n  The junk bytes are a fragment of Microsoft\u2019s linker, LINK.EXE. There is an  almost identical code sequence within LINK.EXE that was shipped on the PC DOS 1.1 disk. The sequence is close enough and unique enough that it\u2019s extremely implausible that it might have come from anywhere else.\n For one thing, the code fragment looks like something generated by a high-level language compiler, yet the bulk of DOS 1.1 was written in assembly language. Notably MASM and LINK were not; both were written in Microsoft\u2019s Pascal.\n The first person to make this discovery (as far as we can tell) was Daniel B. Sedory aka The Starman, whose  illustrated PC DOS 1.1 boot sector page is much nicer than anything I could put together.\n I followed about two weeks later. Back when I was  reconstructing PC DOS 1.1, I noticed the boot sector junk, but at the time I did not make the next step of trying to identify where it might have come from.\n The junk in the PC DOS 1.1 boot sector isn\u2019t the only instance of such junk. For example IBMBIO.COM also contains a different and larger junk sequence which is partly a repetition of the contents of IBMBIO.COM itself.\n It is virtually certain that the junk bytes came indirectly from development tools used for building PC DOS 1.1, namely Microsoft\u2019s assembler/linker. MASM can define \u201cuninitialized data\u201d and the linker interprets that quite literally, placing uninitialized data into the resulting executable. The bytes are probably somewhat unpredictable memory contents and might contain fragments of the linked program\u2019s data or code, or even fragments of the linker itself.\n The junk somewhat complicates analysis of the resulting executables because it\u2019s not trivial to prove that it has no function; even if the junk bytes never get executed, they might end up being copied somewhere, or become part of the stack contents, and affect program execution indirectly.\n  There is no reason to believe that the junk bytes are the result of programmer intent. But there are two other oddities that are not random and are much harder to explain.\n One is \u201czero-terminated strings\u201d. When the boot sector checks whether a disk is bootable, it verifies that the first two root directory entries are IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM. To that end, the strings \u2018ibmbio com\u2019 and \u2018ibmdos com\u2019 are stored in the boot sector. They are stored in lowercase (and the root directory contents are forced to lowercase, too), which is itself odd, since it\u2019s not clear how the directory entries could ever not be uppercase. Perhaps this was not strictly enough specified, or the boot sector code tried to be extra careful.\n But the real weirdness is that the strings are \u201cterminated\u201d with ASCII character \u20180\u2019 (zero). That is to say, in the boot sector they are stored as \u201cibmbio com0ibmdos com0\u201d. The zeros have no function since only up to 11 bytes are compared for each of the two file names. This was perhaps a oversight and the strings were meant to be null-terminated, but instead of writing\n    Since the terminator has no function, the mistake was never found and corrected. That is just speculation but it makes at least some sort of sense.\n There is  another strangeness related to string termination, although it was mostly gone from PC DOS 1.1.\n In PC DOS 1.0, strings in the boot sector  and in IBMBIO.COM are null-terminated, but the last character of text also has the high bit set. The routine which prints the strings strips the high bit from all characters.\n Again, it\u2019s very unclear what purpose this might have had. The high bits are simply stripped and thrown away, but it cannot be a coincidence that the last character of each string in the boot sector and in IBMBIO.COM has the high bit set.\n In PC DOS 1.1, the high bits are no longer set on the boot sector and IBMBIO.COM strings, but the print string routine in the boot sector still strips them. That was presumably a harmless omission.\n It is possible that in some earlier incarnation, the strings were high-bit-terminated, then changed to null-terminated, but the high bit still remained set and stripped in PC DOS 1.0, and in PC DOS 1.1 only the stripping remained.\n Note that in the PC DOS 1.0 boot sector, the strange zero-termination is combined with high-bit-termination, and the strings \u2018ibmbio com0\u2019 and \u2018ibmdos com0\u2019 are each stored with the last byte as B0h, which is ASCII \u20180\u2019 (30h) + 80h. In PC DOS 1.1, the high bit is no longer set.\n  Terminating strings by setting the high bit of the last character was a somewhat common practice on machines with limited memory and no need to process anything beyond 7-bit ASCII (that is, a great many systems in 1980 and earlier). Microsoft used this technique in BASIC; especially for storing BASIC token tables, using the high bit instead of a length or terminator byte saved hundreds of bytes of precious ROM.\n DOS does not generally use this technique (strings are generally dollar-terminated), although for example DEBUG uses high bit termination for the instruction mnemonic table in the disassembler, again saving a byte per mnemonic which does add up.\n Terminating strings by setting the high bit was clearly a widespread technique at the time (one most likely independently invented more than once) and presumably known to all Microsoft programmers. It is thus not surprising to find it in the parts of DOS written by Microsoft (boot sector, IBMBIO.COM, SYS.COM, FORMAT.COM), quite possibly even written by a single programmer, Bob O\u2019Rear.\n It is possible that Microsoft used some assembler string definition macros which automatically added the high bit terminator (see e.g. \u2018Q\u2019 macro in BASIC\u2019s  BINTRP.H). That might partially explain the strange double termination seen e.g. in FORMAT.COM from  PC DOS 0.9 where strings are terminated with ASCII \u2018$\u2019 and a B0h byte (ASCII \u20180\u2019 with high bit set); whatever it was meant to accomplish, the B0h is redundant because DOS won\u2019t get past the \u2018$\u2019 when displaying strings. But if a string definition macro automatically set the high bit, an extra byte would have had to be added because DOS would not recognize ASCII \u2018$\u2019 with high bit set as the expected terminator.\n All in all, it\u2019s clear that the code Microsoft wrote for PC DOS underwent some evolution and was cleaned up only after the PC DOS 1.0 release, with some vestiges of the earlier iterations remaining even in PC DOS 1.1.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:53:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "pc,\u62c6\u5378", "title": "\u672a\u8ba4\u5b9a\u7684PC DOS 1.1\u5f15\u5bfc\u6247\u533a\u5783\u573e\u8bc6\u522b", "title_en": "Unidentified PC DOS 1.1 Boot Sector Junk Identified", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.os2museum.com/wp/unidentified-pc-dos-1-1-boot-sector-junk-identified/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pc", "\u62c6\u5378"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072449, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5357\u5361\u7f57\u6765\u7eb3\u5dde\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5df2\u8bc9\u8bf8\u4e8e20\u6b21\u6709\u5173\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u6b3a\u8bc8\u7f6a\uff0c\u8be5\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u7684PHONY\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7edf\u4e00\u7f51\u7edc\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8d85\u8fc7735,000\u4e2a\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u534f\u8bae\uff08IP\uff09\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u4ece\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u79df\u8d41\u6570\u5b57\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u79df\u8d41\u5317\u7f8e\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u3002\n\u52302013\u5e74\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u963b\u6b62\u5783\u573e\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u56e2\uff0c\u8bb8\u591aMicfo\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u964d\u843d\u5728Spamhaus\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e0a\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u65af\u5a01\u5c14\u6c83\u5c71\u5f00\u59cb\u963b\u6b62MICFO\u7684IP\u5730\u5740\u8303\u56f4\uff0cMICFO\u79fb\u4f4d\u9f7f\u8f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u8f6c\u552eIP\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u8425\u9500\u201c\u865a\u62df\u4e13\u7528\u7f51\u7edc\u201d\u6216VPN\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u7ebf\u9690\u85cf\u5176\u771f\u5b9eIP\u5730\u5740\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\u51e0\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\u540e\uff0c\u4e91\u521b\u65b0\u4f7f\u6cd5\u5b98\u5728Afrinic\u7684\u7956\u56fd\u5c45\u4f4f\u7684\u6cd5\u5b98\u4e2d\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e86Afrinic Bank\u8d26\u6237\u76845000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e89\u8bbaAfrinic\u201c\u4ee5\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u538c\u6076\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u73b7\u6c61\u4e86\u4e91\u521b\u65b0\u58f0\u8a89\uff0c\u201d\u5b83\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5176\u5ba2\u6237\u514d\u53d7\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002\n\u8fd9\u663e\u7136\u660e\u663e\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4eba\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d5a\u94b1\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u8086\u65e0\u5fcc\u60ee\u3002\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4e0d\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5236\u4f5c\u201c\u5de8\u5927\u201d\u91d1\u989d\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u5730\u52aa\u529b\u505a\u51fa\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u90a3\u4e48\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u5730\u72f1\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u957f\uff01\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u8db3\u591f\u8d85\u8fc71mm / yr\uff0c$ 200mm / yr ????\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u523050\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143/\u5e74\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u8db3\u4ee5\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u5982\u4f55\u751f\u6d3b\u5728500k /\u5e74\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u80fd\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e76\u4e0d\u50cf\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\u660e\u4eae\u3002\n\u5e03\u83b1\u6069\uff0c\u4f60\u53d1\u5e03\u4e862020\u5e74\u7684\u5e3d\u5b50\u91c7\u8bbf\u5417\uff1f\u9605\u8bfb\u4f1a\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u6211\u4f3c\u4e4e\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u5b83\u3002", "note_en": "The CEO of a South Carolina technology firm has pleaded guilty to 20 counts of wire fraud in connection with an elaborate network of phony companies set up to obtain more than 735,000 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the nonprofit organization that leases the digital real estate to entities in North America.\n  In 2018, the  American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), which oversees IP addresses assigned to entities in the U.S., Canada, and parts of the Caribbean, notified Charleston, S.C. based  Micfo LLC that it intended to revoke 735,000 addresses.\n ARIN said they wanted the addresses back because the company and its owner \u2014 38-year-old  Amir Golestan \u2014 had obtained them under false pretenses. A global  shortage of IPv4 addresses has massively driven up the price of these resources over the years: At the time of this dispute, a single IP address could fetch between $15 and $25 on the open market.\n Micfo responded by suing ARIN to try to stop the IP address seizure. Ultimately, ARIN and Micfo settled the dispute in arbitration, with Micfo returning most of the addresses that it hadn\u2019t already sold.\n But the legal tussle caught the attention of  South Carolina U.S. Attorney Sherri Lydon, who in May 2019  filed criminal wire fraud charges against Golestan, alleging he\u2019d orchestrated a network of shell companies and fake identities to prevent ARIN from knowing the addresses were all going to the same buyer.\n Each of those shell companies involved the production of notarized affidavits in the names of people who didn\u2019t exist. As a result, Lydon was able to charge Golestan with 20 counts of wire fraud \u2014 one for each payment made by the phony companies that bought the IP addresses from ARIN.\n  On Nov. 16, just two days into his trial, Golestan changed his \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea, agreeing to plead guilty to all 20 wire fraud charges. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Golestan about his case at length last year, but he has not responded to requests for comment on his plea change.\n By 2013, a number of Micfo\u2019s customers had landed on the radar of  Spamhaus, a group that many network operators rely upon to help block junk email. But shortly after Spamhaus began blocking Micfo\u2019s IP address ranges, Micfo shifted gears and began reselling IP addresses mainly to companies marketing \u201cvirtual private networking\u201d or VPN services that help customers hide their real IP addresses online.\n In a 2020 interview, Golestan told KrebsOnSecurity that Micfo was at one point responsible for brokering roughly 40 percent of the IP addresses used by the world\u2019s largest VPN providers. Throughout that conversation, Golestan maintained his innocence, even as he explained that the creation of the phony companies was necessary to prevent entities like Spamhaus from interfering with his business going forward.\n Stephen Ryan, an attorney representing ARIN, said Golestan changed his plea after the court heard from a former Micfo employee and public notary who described being instructed by Golestan to knowingly certify false documents.\n \u201cHer testimony made him appear bullying and unsavory,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBecause it turned out he had also sued her to try to prevent her from disclosing the actions he\u2019d directed.\u201d\n Golestan\u2019s  rather sparse plea agreement ( first reported by The Wall Street Journal) does not specify any sort of leniency he might gain from prosecutors for agreeing to end the trial prematurely. But it\u2019s worth noting that a conviction on a single act of wire fraud can result in fines and up to 20 years in prison.\n The courtroom drama comes as ARIN\u2019s counterpart in Africa is embroiled in a similar, albeit much larger dispute over millions of African IP addresses. In July 2021, the  African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC)  took back more than six million IP addresses from  Cloud Innovation, a company incorporated in the African offshore entity haven of Seychelles (pronounced, quite aptly \u2014 \u201csay shells\u201d).\n  AFRINIC revoked the addresses \u2014 valued at around USD $120 million \u2014 after an internal review found that most of them were being used outside of Africa by various entities in China and Hong Kong. Like ARIN, AFRINIC\u2019s policies require those who are leasing IP addresses to demonstrate that the addresses are being used by entities within their geographic region.\n But just weeks later, Cloud Innovation convinced a judge in AFRINIC\u2019s home country of Mauritius  to freeze $50 million in AFRINIC bank accounts,  arguing that AFRINIC had \u201cacted in bad faith and upon frivolous grounds to tarnish the reputation of Cloud Innovation,\u201d and that it was obligated to protect its customers from disruption of service.\n That financial freeze has since been partially lifted, but the legal wrangling between AFRINIC and Cloud Innovation continues. The company\u2019s CEO is also suing the CEO and board chair of AFRINIC in an $80 million defamation case.\n Ron Guilmette is a security researcher who spent several years tracing how tens of millions of dollars worth of AFRINIC IP addresses were  privately sold to address brokers by a former AFRINIC executive. Guilmette said Golestan\u2019s guilty plea is a positive sign for AFRINIC, ARIN and the three other  Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).\n \u201cIt\u2019s good news for the rule of law,\u201d Guilmette said. \u201cIt has implications for the AFRINIC case because it reaffirms the authority of all RIRs, including AFRINIC and ARIN.\u201d\n       Iranian?\u2026.hmmmmm\u2026.no foolin\u2019\u2026\u2026to paraphrase Frank Zappa from \u201cCamarillo Brillo\u201d\u2026..\n  If he had figured out a way to do this without deliberately lying in the notary process, somehow\u2026\n  The Notary process in the US is a joke. In many states you pay the fee and get someone to say you\u2019re a good person in front of a magistrate and *POOF*, you\u2019re a notary.\n    It\u2019s kind of sad that these obviously bright people think that the only way they can make money is to be unscrupulous. OK, maybe not the only way, but the only way to make \u2018huge\u2019 amounts of money. If they put as much effort into legitimate efforts, they probably wouldn\u2019t make quite as much, but they would sure as hell get to keep it longer! And, seriously, when is enough enough $1MM/yr, $200MM/yr???? The average person can live on $50K/yr. I\u2019d think they are bright enough to figure out how to live on $500K/yr. If they can\u2019t then they aren\u2019t as bright as they think they are.\n  Most hosting companies are now charging about $20 a month for a dedicated IP number now and days, because of the IP4 shortage\n      No worries, his younger brother Amin Golestan runs Braveway, Aventice, Micfo, ALTUS COMMUNICATIONS among other shell companies for him now.\n  Their sister also runs the same operation under Azadeh Golestan Parast trading as Virtual Dedicated Datacenter Services\n  If he\u2019s a green card holder, then he can be deported if convicted. He\u2019d probably be a hero back in Iran and treated well if he can continue scamming from there.\n If he\u2019s a US citizen, then he should become a televangelist, after studying the techniques of the masters of con, e.g. Ernest Angley, Peter Popoff, Reverend Ike, Robert Tilton, Jim Bakker and their like. He has already has the hair and the wardrobe. He could end up making more than he was making, tax free.\n  Why are all these retarded political comments being accepted? Is moderation broke? Half of the comments here are reddit-tier \u2018troll\u2019 posts.\n    Brian, did you publish the 2020 interview of Golestan? It would be interesting to read. I can\u2019t seem to locate it.\n    arin et afrinic we see that they have no qualms about helping crooks we must not forget all the others like apnic, lacnic , Ripe ncc , rirns.arin.net , ca -servers.ca , nic.expert , nic.art , dnsowl , ultradns , registrar -servers , cloudflare and etc \u2026 And above all we must not forget the hosts selling armored vps like frantech.ca buyvm.net which are used a lot by pedophile forums, zoophiles, phishing sites, botnets and etc \u2026 are they all accomplices or not? me on what I could see on their servers I said to myself that it might be time to step up and investigate them!\n  Quite strange that ARIN decided to settle out of court with a criminal. Almost smells here that someone inside at ARIN is in cahoots, perhaps providing him a roadmap of what to do, and then to facilitate the settlement with him. I\u2019m certain that he\u2019s passed along the blueprint to his family and friends, for them to enact the same crimes from different states and different countries. IMO -non attorney- Filing bogus notarized affidavits is a serious breach of laws and he should be held fully accountable. Stealing from public domain, what others could need and use, would have countless victims other than ARIN.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 21:51:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9996\u5e2d,ceo,afrinic", "title": "\u6280\u672f\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5728IP\u5730\u5740\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u6073\u6c42\u6b3a\u8bc8", "title_en": "Tech CEO pleads to wire fraud in IP address scheme", "transed": 1, "url": "https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/tech-ceo-pleads-to-wire-fraud-in-ip-address-scheme/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9996\u5e2d", "ceo", "afrinic"]}]
