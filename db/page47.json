The percentage of professional developers saying they were independent contractors, freelancers, or self-employed increased from 9.5% in 2020 to 11.2% in 2021 - indicating potential job insecurity or a shift to more flexible work arrangements.\n   Employment status  \u2192\n  The United States and India continue to provide the highest volume of survey responses, followed by Germany and UKI (UK and Ireland). The top ten countries account for almost 60% of all respondents. To see the top ten countries, refer to the methodology section. When we zoom into the United States (our top-responding country), we see that the states with established tech hubs have the most respondents: California, New York, Washington, and Texas.\n  Coders start young: over 50% of respondents wrote their first line of code between the ages of 11 to 17.\n  It is no surprise that almost 60% of respondents learned how to code from online resources. Younger respondents tend to learn from online courses, forums, and other online resources. Older respondents, on the other hand, learned from more traditional mediums like school and books.\n  50% of respondents have been coding for ten years or less. Respondents from the United Kingdom, on average, have the most years coding out of our top ten countries.\n  A majority of respondents have been working for ten or less years as a professional developer, meaning they\u2019ve never worked in a world without Stack Overflow.\n  Developers in more senior roles have the most years of coding professionally. Data scientists and machine learning specialists, meanwhile, have the least experience, with fewer years than academic researchers.\n  Full stack, back-end, front-end, and desktop developers continue to account for the majority of all respondents.\n  70% of all respondents and 80% of professional developers have completed some form of higher education, a bachelor\u2019s degree being the most common.\n  48% of professional developers are 25-34 years old. Almost half of the respondents 65 years or older do not consider themselves professional developers.\n  91% of all respondents and 92% of professional developers identify as a man. The United States has the highest percentage of gender minorities (Woman, Non-binary, genderqueer, or gender non-conforming). We have considerable work to do to ensure our platform is inclusive and that our survey is representative of developers everywhere.\n    11.5% of respondents identify as something other than straight / heterosexual, with 6.5% preferring not to identify with any orientation. There\u2019s still so much work to be done to ensure the developer community is more inclusive.\n    2,960 respondents have a physical difference, with the majority of these respondents being blind or having difficulty seeing.\n  Over 16,000 respondents replied to our question on mental health, with almost 10% of all respondents indicating they deal with anxiety.\n  JavaScript completes its ninth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language. For most developers, programming is web programming. Python traded places with SQL to become the third most popular language.\n  The most common databases are consistent between all respondents and professional developers. The only difference we observed is that professional developers are slightly more likely to use Microsoft SQL Server over MongoDB.\n  AWS maintains its lead as the most widely used cloud platform, but Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure made substantial gains from last year. It is worth noting that this is the first year that we broke out cloud platforms from our general platforms question.\n    The .NET framework gets the most love in other technologies, though several data science libraries for Python make strong showings.\n  Over 90% of respondents use Git, suggesting that it is a fundamental tool to being a developer.\n  Visual Studio Code has a significant lead as the IDE of choice across all developers.\n  Windows continues to be the most popular operating system, though slightly less so among professional developers. This year was also the first time we added WSL as an option.\n  For the sixth-year, Rust is the most loved language, while Python is the most wanted language for its fifth-year.\n  82,914 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  Redis is in its fifth year as the most loved database. PostgreSQL barely passes MongoDB with less than a percent as the most wanted database. And IBM DB2 is on its second year in a row as the most dreaded database.\n  72,517 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  AWS is leading as not only the most loved cloud platform but also the most wanted.\n  60,516 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  Newcomer Svelte takes the top spot as the most loved framework. React is the most wanted, desired by one in four developers.\n  66,202 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  While Tensorflow is the most wanted library, Pytorch is a more loved library. As .NET Core users here at Stack Overflow, we\u2019re pleased to see it in the top spot.\n  58,282 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  Earlier, we saw that Git was used by 93% of all respondents. Now we saw that 85% of those respondents want to continue working with Git. Git, Docker, and Kubernetes are both the most loved and most wanted tools.\n  75,793 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  81,838 responses  % of developers who are not developing with the language or technology but have expressed interest in developing with it\n  There is a lot to unpack here, but here are some of the most notable trends we uncovered. There are over 10k Javascript developers that want to start or continue developing in Go or Rust. The majority of developers that want to use Dart are currently using JavaScript. We also see the only developers that want to work in PHP are SQL developers.\n  12,590 MySQL developers want to work with PostgreSQL, while 6,429 PostgreSQL developers want to work with MySQL.\n  While AWS is the most loved platform, we see a large influx of AWS developers wanting to develop in Google Cloud next year. 8,586 AWS developers want to work with Google Cloud, while only 7,668 Google Cloud developers want to work in AWS. Developers currently using Heroku or Digital Ocean prefer to start working with or continue working with AWS, then Google Cloud, and lastly Azure. Very few developers currently using Azure want to move to Heroku.\n  Django, Flask, and Spring developers are content to continue working in their respective frameworks. Very few developers want to work with ASP.NET.\n  The developers who want to work in Hadoop are currently using Pandas or Numpy. There and 3,328 Tensorflow developers that want to continue to use PyTorch, but only 2,328 Pytorch developers that want to move to Tensorflow.\n    We see IPython/Jupyter users want to work in VS Code. This is likely due to VS Codes adding a Notebook API to their IDE.\n    Perl moves from being the highest-paid language last year to the fifth highest-paid this year. Clojure developers have the highest median salary, 14k more than second place which belongs to F#.\n  81% of professional developers are employed full-time, a decrease from 83% in 2020. The percentage of professional developers saying they were independent contractors, freelancers, or self-employed increased from 9.5% in 2020 to 11.2% in 2021 - indicating potential job insecurity or a shift to more flexible work arrangements.\n  The percent of employed full-time respondents from India decreased by 15 percentage points compared to last year. In contrast, the number of students increased by 9 percentage points.\n    Across the board, engineering managers, SREs, DevOps specialists, and data engineers tend to receive the highest salaries. When focusing on the US, we see some differences at the bottom of the salary spectrum. In the US, mobile developers and educators tend to have a higher salary relative to other occupations when compared to the global developer population.\n  Even though Engineering managers, SREs, DevOps specialist roles pay the most, we see they also have, on average, over ten years of professional experience. Data scientists or machine learning specialists are the 8th most paid but, on average, have the fewest years of experience. Designers are the lowest paid even though they have over ten years of experience on average.\n  Less than 1% of respondents have never visited Stack Overflow or the Stack Exchange Network.\n  We know that developers visit Stack Overflow a lot, and earlier this year, we confirmed that they copy code just as much. From this year\u2019s survey, we also know that 80% of respondents visit Stack Overflow weekly, and 55% of them visit daily.\n    Of those with a Stack Overflow account, 46% are participating on the site less than once per month or monthly.\n  Only 44% of respondents consider themselves \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d a member of the Stack Overflow community. Of these respondents, we see that gender minorities are less likely to consider themselves a member of the Stack Overflow community.\n  79,517 responses  Percent who consider themselves definitely or somewhat part of the Stack Overflow community out of all respondents.\n  Almost 25 thousand respondents belong to other online developer communities. 85% of the them are open to the public for anyone to join. The majority of these other communities belong on Reddit, Github or Discord.\n  This report is based on a survey of 83,439 software developers from 181 countries around the world. This is the number of responses we consider \u201cqualified\u201d for analytical purposes based on time spent on the full, completed survey; another approximately 172 responses were submitted but not included in the analysis because respondents spent less than three minutes on the survey.\n      Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the prompts to take the survey over the duration of collection promotion.\n  As an incentive, respondents who finished the survey could opt in to a \u201cCensus\u201d badge if they completed the survey.\n  Due to United States transport/export sanctions, our survey was unfortunately unaccessible to prospective respondents in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, due to the traffic being blocked by our third party survey software. While some respondents used VPNs to get around the block, the limitation should be kept in mind when interpreting survey results.\n  Many questions were only shown to respondents based on their previous answers. For example, questions about jobs and work were only shown to those who said they were working in a job.\n  We asked respondents about their salary. First, we asked what currency each respondent typically used. Then we asked that respondent what their salary was in that currency and whether that salary was weekly, monthly, or yearly.\n  The salary question, like most on the survey, was optional. There were 46,844 respondents who gave us salary data.\n  We converted salaries from user currencies to USD using the exchange rate on 2021-06-16, and also converted to annual salaries assuming 12 working months and 50 working weeks.\n  The top approximately 2% of salaries inside and outside of the US were trimmed and replaced with threshold values. The threshold values for inside and outside the US were different.\n  To identify which technologies to include on the survey this year, we looked at both the most popular and fastest growing tags on Stack Overflow (in terms of questions posted). We compared these to the technologies we included last year and looked at how many people chose each option. We synthesized all this together to curate a collection of technologies to include.\n  The questions were organized into several blocks of questions, which were randomized in order. Also, the answers to most questions were randomized in order.\n  The majority of respondents felt like this year\u2019s survey was an appropriate length.\n  Less than one percent of respondents felt like this year\u2019s survey was difficult.\n  I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work", "posttime": "2021-08-07 03:18:08", "source_domain":

"note_en": "The government of New Zealand confirmed on Thursday that Google co-founder Larry Page, the sixth wealthiest person in the world, has obtained residency in New Zealand, according to a report from the news outlet    Stuff. And with that, Page joins a growing list of super-wealthy Americans who are secretly buying residency status in New Zealand, a kind of insurance policy for doomsday.\n  New Zealand\u2019s borders have been tightly controlled since the start of the covid-19 pandemic and reporters started asking questions when word got out that Page, an American, might be in Auckland. New Zealand\u2019s Department of Internal Affairs did not respond to a request for comment overnight.\n Page applied for a special visa on Nov. 3, 2020 and first flew into the country on Jan. 11, 2021 after his child became ill in Fiji, according to    Stuff. Page\u2019s residency visa is known as the Investor Plus, which allows anyone into the country provided they have at least $10 million to invest. The visa wasn\u2019t approved until Feb 4, 2021, after Page entered the country.\n    The 48-year-old Page and his sick child were reportedly airlifted from Fiji to New Zealand\u2019s   Starship children\u2019s hospital using a New Zealand-based air ambulance, but government officials have refused to say whether Page paid for the flight himself, citing medical privacy concerns. It\u2019s not clear what illness Page\u2019s child is suffering from, but Page probably isn\u2019t in the country right now, according to  Stuff, and it\u2019s unclear where he might be at the moment.\n  Curiously, the New Zealand government denied to  Stuff that Page was a resident of the country earlier this week, but eventually the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment admitted that had recently received his special visa.\n   Page reportedly spent time in quarantine once he arrived in New Zealand, as everyone who enters is required to do, but the details around his accommodations haven\u2019t been released. It\u2019s not clear, for example, whether Page was allowed to see his sick child in person during that time.\n New Zealand, a country of just 5 million people, has seen 2,880 cases of covid-19 since the start of the pandemic and 26 deaths, one of the lowest rates of infection and death in the world. The country is essentially operating like covid-19 never happened and New Zealanders are understandably touchy about rich people buying their way into the country during a plague.\n  Page, worth an estimated $121 billion, is just the latest tech billionaire to be revealed as having secret residency or citizenship in the island nation, which has been attracting wealthy westerners who see it as a place to flee if society truly collapses from climate change, rampant disease, \u201c  pitchforks\u201d for the rich, or any other host of problems.\n Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, was revealed   in 2017 to have been granted New Zealand citizenship after locals questioned why he was allowed to own a house on protected land. Thiel, a close ally of former president Donald Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, apparently took the oath of citizenship for New Zealand in Santa Monica, California.\n  New Zealand was recently determined to be the best place to ride out the apocalypse, thanks to its relatively small population, renewable energy, and abundant fresh water supply. The   new study from the Global Sustainability Institute at Anglia Ruskin University also included spots like Australia, the UK, and Ireland, but New Zealand topped the list.\n The    New Yorker reported in 2017 about the flood of people, especially rich Americans and Europeans, who are getting a foothold in New Zealand as their insurance policy against collapse. And it\u2019s basically an open secret among the wealthy that we don\u2019t have much time left for any kind of \u201cnormalcy\u201d here on planet Earth.\n  \u201cSaying you\u2019re \u2018buying a house in New Zealand\u2019 is kind of a wink, wink, say no more,\u201d Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, told the  New Yorker back in 2017.\n Where is Page going to spend his $10 million in New Zealand, something that needs to happen within the next three years under the Investor Plus visa? The rumors are that he\u2019s interested in air taxis.\n   Page is understood to have an interest in Wisk Aviation, which has developed an electric, autonomous aircraft intended for use as an air taxi. The company has its headquarters in the US but has a presence in New Zealand and will trial aircraft here.\n  Page\u2019s interest in the company arises from Kitty Hawk, the aviation company he backs. Wisk, formerly called Zephyr, is a joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk.\n  While New Zealand\u2019s citizenship office didn\u2019t respond to our email, the agency notes on its website that processing applications is taking   longer than usual. Probably because so many tech billionaires are knocking on the door to get in.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 03:17:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

The article has been updated to reflect this.\n Coca-Cola, Kellogg and State Farm are reassessing partnerships with Activision Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch League, according to statements provided by all three companies. The news comes two weeks after the state of California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued the video game giant over allegations of widespread harassment and discrimination against female employees at the company.\n Activision Blizzard runs the Overwatch League and the Call of Duty League, two esports ventures that organize competitions around those respective first-person shooter titles. Coca-Cola and State Farm are two of five sponsors currently listed on the  Overwatch League website. Kellog\u2019s Cheez-it and Pringles brands were removed from the list Friday morning.\n   Brand deals with big companies bleed into all aspects of the league\u2019s match-day production. There are sponsored player rankings powered by IBM, prominently placed red Coca-Cola cups next to commentators and quick-rolling advertisements that run between the action in a match. The partnerships are key ways for the league \u2014 and Activision Blizzard \u2014 to bring in revenue alongside broadcasting rights and franchise fees.\n In two statements provided to The Post Thursday, a spokesperson for State Farm said the insurance provider is \u201creevaluating our limited marketing relationship with the Overwatch League,\u201d and the company has requested that \u201cno advertisements run during the matches this weekend.\u201d State Farm first became a sponsor of the Overwatch League  in 2019.\n  A spokesperson for Coca-Cola said Wednesday that the company is \u201caware of the allegations surrounding Activision Blizzard\u201d and has been closely monitoring the situation.\n \u201cWe are working with our partners at Blizzard as we take a step back for a moment to revisit future plans and programs,\u201d the statement reads.\n  The spokesperson for Coca-Cola declined to comment on whether Coca-Cola would continue to sponsor the Overwatch League. The next Overwatch League match is scheduled for Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern time. Coca-Cola, Kellogg and State Farm ran  advertisements in Overwatch League matches  earlier this week.\n    The lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, one of the world\u2019s biggest video game companies, alleges multiple instances of gender-based discrimination, inequality and harassment. Last week,  Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout outside of the headquarters of Blizzard Entertainment, known for its massively popular titles like \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d and \u201cOverwatch.\u201d\n On Tuesday, J. Allen Brack, stepped down from his post as president of Blizzard Entertainment. That same day, Jesse Meschuk, a human resources executive at the company, resigned. The company, which is a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, will now be co-led by Jen Oneal and Mike Ybarra, both of whom joined the company in the past two years.\n  Branding for T-Mobile, another company that once partnered with both the Overwatch League and Call of Duty League, also vanished from official broadcasts in the wake of the lawsuit.\n   Last weekend, the New York Subliners \u2014 one of 12 Call of Duty League teams \u2014 covered the T-Mobile logo on their jerseys with duct tape, and the company is no longer listed as a partner on either league\u2019s website.\n On \u201c Plat Chat,\u201d a talk show that covers the Overwatch League, pink coffee mugs sporting the words \u201cpresented by T-Mobile\u201d also disappeared. The podcast has a rotating cast of commentators, some of whom work full time for the Overwatch League, though one host told The Post the podcast is completely separate from Activision Blizzard. The host declined to answer questions earlier this week because they said the show is still in active talks with T-Mobile.\n   The Post has reached out to other Overwatch League sponsors \u2014 Xfinity, IBM, TeamSpeak and Toyota \u2014 and the sponsors of the Call of Duty League, who have not responded to requests for comments.\n     The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:33:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "state,lawsuit", "title": "\u5728\u9a9a\u6270\u8bc9\u8bbc\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50\u3001State Farm \u9000\u51fa\u66b4\u96ea\u7684\u5b88\u671b\u5148\u950b\u8054\u8d5b", "title_en": "Amid harassment lawsuit, Coca Cola, State Farm pull back from Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch League", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/05/activision-blizzard-sponsors-overwatch/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["state", "lawsuit"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9baa123b07533e46b69d71bce23e3ecc.jpg", "infoid": 1071829, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u5174\u7ea2\u6749\u5408\u4f19\u4eba Stephanie Zhan \u548c Rec Room \u521b\u59cb\u4eba Nick Fajt \u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5468\u52a0\u5165\u6211\u4eec\u7684 Extra Crunch Live\u3002 Rec Room \u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u4f4d\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u670b\u53cb\u5408\u4f5c\u6784\u5efa\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u4e16\u754c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\uff0cRec Room \u6b63\u5728\u601d\u8003\u672a\u6765\u7684\u51fa\u8def\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86\u8fd1 1.5 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7ea2\u6749\u9886\u6295\u4e86 Rec Room \u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u8f6e\u548c A \u8f6e\u878d\u8d44\u3002 Stephanie Zhan \u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u7ea2\u6749\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u4e00\u5458\uff0c\u5176\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5305\u62ec Sunday\uff08\u6237\u5916\u5bb6\u5ead\u8ba2\u9605\u670d\u52a1\uff09\u3001Linear\uff08\u73b0\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5de5\u5177\uff09\u548c Middesk\uff08\u4f01\u4e1a\u80cc\u666f\u8c03\u67e5\uff09\u3002\u5979\u8fd8\u5e2e\u52a9\u9886\u5bfc\u4e86\u5bf9 Graphcore\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff09\u3001Evervault\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\uff09\u548c Doppler\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u7ba1\u7406\uff09\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u542c\u53d6\u8fd9\u4f4d\u521b\u59cb\u4eba/\u6295\u8d44\u4eba\u4e8c\u4eba\u7ec4\u5173\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u8bc6\u3001\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u5f7c\u6b64\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u514b\u670d\u524d\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u514d\u8d39\u6ce8\u518c\uff01 Extra Crunch Live \u8fd8\u8bbe\u6709 ECL Pitch-off\uff0c\u89c2\u4f17\u4e2d\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5c06\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u865a\u62df\u5730\u4e3e\u624b\u5e76\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\u6295\u7403\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u73b0\u573a\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c2\u52a0 Extra Crunch Live\uff0c\u4f46\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u5bb9\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e Extra Crunch \u4f1a\u5458\u3002\u8be5\u6b7b\u7684\uff0cExtra Crunch \u5e93\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8fd8\u4e0d\u662f\u4f1a\u5458\uff0c\u60a8\u8fd8\u5728\u7b49\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5728\u6b64\u6ce8\u518c\u3002", "note_en": "So it should go without saying that we are absolutely thrilled to have  Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Rec Room founder Nick Fajt join us on Extra Crunch Live in the coming weeks.\n Rec Room is a Seattle-based startup that allows users to not only play games, but to build them collaboratively with their friends.

"note_en": "The company has seen strong uptake in its home market, and the first goal is to be #1 in Australia, said CEO and Founder Nick Hazell, formerly of Masterfoods and Pepsico R&amp;D. But in the meantime they\u2019ll be expanding their presence in Asia, where partner Burger King has launched a Whopper with their patty, and in Europe, where the product\u2019s minimal suspicious elements come into play.\n Currently v2Food makes plant-based ground beef and patties, sausages, and a ready-made Bolognese sauce. Obviously they have strong competition in those categories, which are sort of the opening play of most alternative protein companies. But v2Food has a leg up on many of them in two ways.\n  First, v2Food products are made, or at least can be made, using \u201cany standard meat production facility.\u201d That\u2019s a big plus for scaling and a minus for cost, since economies of scale are already in play. The processes for creating and mixing the plant-derived and other artificial substances that make up alternative proteins in general aren\u2019t always amenable to existing infrastructure. This also opens the door to partnerships with existing meat companies that might have balked at having to switch processes. (Incidentally, Hazell noted that what they\u2019re aiming for isn\u2019t so much about replacing traditional meats so much as growing the market in a new direction, a philosophy those companies may appreciate.)\n Second, as the press release announcing the fundraise puts it, \u201cv2food products do not contain GMOs, preservatives, colors or flavorings. This makes it an ideal product for the European market, where the many large competitors have been unable to enter the market due to strict regulation.\u201d It\u2019s also a soft advantage for winning over in-store buyers vacillating between two plant-based options; who hasn\u2019t on occasion ended up going for the one with fewer ingredients that proudly touts its lack of preservatives and such? The alt-protein buying demographic is likely especially sensitive to this consideration.\n The \u20ac45M round is a \u201cB Plus,\u201d led by European impact fund Astanor and with participation from Huaxing Growth Capitol Fund,  Main Sequence, and ABC World Asia. The money is going towards both R&amp;D and scaling.\n   \u201cThis funding is an important step towards v2food\u2019s goal of transforming the way the world produces food,\u201d said Hazell. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we scale quickly because these global issues need immediate solutions.\u201d\n To that end a large portion will go towards simply creating enough product to meet demand. They\u2019re also doubling R&amp;D spend to both accelerate new products and improve the existing ones. And rather than import the necessary ingredients to Australia, they\u2019re exploring the possibility of building a local manufacturing facility there. With luck and a bit of plant-based elbow grease, the region could become a net exporter, propping up the local economy as well as building up v2Food\u2019s resilience and cutting costs.\n The Europe expansion is still a twinkle in the company\u2019s (and Astanor\u2019s) eye, for even with its simplicity and non-GMO origins, it\u2019s not trivial to launch a new product in the European market.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:32:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "v2food,\u4ea7\u54c1", "title": "\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684 v2Food \u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5 4500 \u4e07\u6b27\u5143\u7684\u878d\u8d44\u5c06\u5176\u690d\u7269\u6027\u8089\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4e9a\u6d32", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAustralia\u2019s v2Food aims to expand its plant-based meats to Europe and Asia with \u20ac45M raise\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/australias-v2food-aims-to-expand-its-plant-based-meats-to-europe-and-asia-with-e45m-raise/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["v2food", "\u4ea7\u54c1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2d8c7651f25aa913a56d5ae2637defa1.jpeg", "infoid": 1071826, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Moderna Inc. \u5468\u56db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u63a5\u79cd\u4e24\u5242 Covid-19 \u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u79cb\u5b63\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u6ce8\u5c04\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u75ab\u82d7\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u5bf9\u9884\u9632 Covid-19 \u75be\u75c5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7387\u4e3a 90%\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u793a\u516d\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u6297\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5305\u62ec Delta \u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5185\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u3002 Moderna \u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u914d\u65b9\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u6b21\u6ce8\u5c04\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9 Covid-19 \u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6297\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u3002 Moderna \u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u65af\u8482\u82ac\u00b7\u73ed\u585e\u5c14 (St\u00e9phane Bancel) \u5468\u56db\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u91c7\u8bbf\u65f6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u5206\u6790\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u540e\uff0c\u5728 9 \u6708\u4efd\u5bfb\u6c42\u76d1\u7ba1\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u6279\u51c6\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u5242\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u514d\u75ab\u529b\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u800c\u7ee7\u7eed\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e00\u4e9b\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8005\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5305\u62ec Delta \u5728\u5185\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e2d\u548c\u6297\u4f53\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u8c28\u614e\u884c\u4e8b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u75c5\u6bd2\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\u3002\u201d \u300a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u300b\u5c06\u5411\u60a8\u6536\u53d6 $ + \u7a0e\u6b3e\uff08\u5982\u679c\u9002\u7528\uff09\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u66f4\u6539\u60a8\u7684\u8ba1\u8d39\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8d39\u7387\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u63d0\u524d\u6536\u5230\u901a\u77e5\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Moderna Inc. said Thursday it expects people who received its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine to need  a booster shot in the fall to keep strong protection against newer variants of the coronavirus.\n  The company said its vaccine remains 90% effective against preventing Covid-19 disease for at least six months, but said it sees a decline in antibody levels after six months, especially against newer strains of the coronavirus including the Delta variant.

booster for the first time on Friday morning, giving a look at the scale of the combined nearly 400-foot-tall vehicle.\n Musk, asked by CNBC what he thought of witnessing the milestone at the company&#39;s facility in Boca Chica, Texas, responded simply.\n    SpaceX is developing Starship to launch cargo and people on missions to the moon and Mars. Starship prototypes stand at about 160 feet tall, or around the size of a 16-story building, and are built of stainless steel \u2013 representing the early version of\u00a0 the rocket that Musk\u00a0unveiled in 2019.\n The rocket lifts off on top of a Super Heavy booster, which makes up the bottom half of the rocket and stands about 230 feet tall. Together, Starship and Super Heavy are nearly 400 feet tall when stacked for launch.\n    SpaceX has conducted multiple short test flights of Starship prototypes over the past year, but reaching orbit represents the next step in testing the rocket. The company in May\u00a0 revealed its plan for the first orbital flight, which would launch from the company&#39;s facility in Texas and aim to splash down off the coast of Hawaii.\n  The company has been working rapidly\u00a0to ready Starship and the Super Heavy booster for the orbital flight test, although\u00a0 a local environmental review by the Federal Aviation Administration needs to be completed\u00a0before the launch happens.\n   Musk outlined four &#34;significant items&#34; that SpaceX aims to complete over the next two weeks in preparing Starship 20 for launch.\n He said SpaceX needs to add the &#34;final heat shield tiles&#34; to the ship, add &#34;thermal protection&#34; to the Raptor rocket engines in Booster 4, complete work on &#34;ground propellant storage tanks,&#34; and add a quick disconnect arm to the top of the recently-built launch tower. The quick disconnect arm connects power and fuel lines to the rocket before launch.\n  While SpaceX&#39;s fleet of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets are partially reusable, Musk&#39;s goal is to make Starship fully reusable \u2014 a rocket that is more akin to a commercial airplane, with short turnaround times between flights such that the only major cost is fuel.\n  One important piece of making Starship fully reusable is improving its durability to survive the intense process of reentering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Small hexagonal heat shield tiles are SpaceX&#39;s answer to that problem, with the previously shiny Starship 20 rocket now covered in thousands of the tiles.\n Musk noted that work on the tiles is about &#34;98% done&#34; for Starship 20, as &#34;the remaining tiles are unique shapes requiring machining.&#34;\n   The U.S. space agency has been paying close attention to Starship&#39;s development, especially as NASA earlier this year  awarded SpaceX with a controversial $2.9 billion contract to deliver astronauts to the surface of the moon using the rockets.\n Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA&#39;s top official for science missions, told CNBC that he continues to watch progress on Starship.\n &#34;Yes, I have been following this all along and am excited for @SpaceX achieving this milestone! Can&#39;t wait to see it fly!&#34; Zurbuchen wrote in a tweet.\n   &#34;Due to its size &amp; ability to return science instruments even from deep space, Starship will enable a whole new class of science missions,&#34; Musk wrote.\n  Become a smarter investor with\u00a0   CNBC Pro .

Do we not trust everybody is working to the best of their ability?\u201d. I got the usual answers about the importance of estimation, planning, etc, and didn\u2019t entirely understand, but accepted.\n Years later, senior myself, I would insist \u2013  every code change must have an associated ticket. That isn\u2019t to say I\u2019m some kind of agile evangelist, but I certainly found ticketing systems indispensable, even for the smallest of teams. Somewhere along the way I had forgotten that I had ever felt otherwise.\n Next role I became the main SRE for a chaotic startup. Some people would hate it, but I  loved it. The buzz and thrill and of a war-room was incomparable to the transactional feature development that would eventually lead to an A/B release that would then possibly lead to a small % improvement in a metric. I loved fixing things for other engineers who I saw in person, who were happy and impressed that I would fix their issue and improved the whole system to make the issue impossible in the future.\n What I loved wasn\u2019t inherent to being an SRE itself. Though a high-stakes role, it can also be as isolating as any role. It can be waking up to an alarm at night to login in by oneself and fix an issue, file a ticket, and have nobody notice.\n  From another angle \u2013 when I go to whole foods and watch the cashier scan my overpriced items, I wonder what they think. Though small talk with strangers is far from a strength for me, I struggle anyways to connect in whatever small way I can. I don\u2019t think I could force a joke and trust the timing to line up with the variable checkout time. I try to be nice without being stiffly polite. It may mean bagging my own groceries, or avoiding the instinct to stare at my phone. I can\u2019t even say for sure that cashiers notice or like it.  I simply presume that if I were in their shoes I wouldn\u2019t want to feel like a machine.\n  Well first, the question: How do we reconcile our desire to feel individually noticed and human with the business needs of standardization? I think this question is the most important piece of this article. I\u2019ll make a proposal or two, to get the ball rolling, but the topic is wide-open.\n What if tickets are filed normally through jira, but then the filer must also come over to the desk of the person operating on the ticket and explain the issue face-to-face?\n What if tickets are described in a way that stresses the emotional importance to the user of the feature?\n What if end-user satisfaction and wishes, as captured by PMs who communicate with users, was shared with engineers?", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:18:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker

"note_en": "Technicolor film was not color film, and it did not produce anything like lifelike colors. But how did it produce color movies? And why did those colors glow? And why did all of it lead to Dorothy getting ruby slippers?\n  As anyone who has seen an old Technicolor film knows, it looks weird. Blue eyes look like they glow. Pink faces look like they&#39;ve been painted peach. Red looks scary. It all looks dyed, not recorded \u2014 and that&#39;s because it was. There wasn&#39;t any color film at the time that Technicolor was making its big splash. No one had figured out how to create a film stock that would record color. They had, however, found a way to make film stock that would filter out all the color that shouldn&#39;t get through. And they had dyes. By putting them together, they made Technicolor glorious.\n  Technicolor cameras didn&#39;t film in color. Instead they filmed in black and white, with different filters. The light entered the camera lens and went to a half-silvered mirror, which split the beam of light through a magenta lens (red and blue together), and a green lens. Behind the magenta lens was film sensitive to blue light, and film sensitive to red light. Behind the green lens was just plain light-sensitive film. The production crew ended up with three sets of film, one showing the blue light that the object they were filming gave off, one showing the red light, and one showing the green. All of these were black and white film strips. They just showed odd-looking pictures. For example, on the &#39;blue&#39; roll, a person with few blue tones in their skin would have skin that looked completely dark, while a blue ribbon would look pure white. Each of the black and white images were dyed with its proper color. Sometimes, when they were dyed, the films would combined and re-filtered, so that only bright blues would make it out of the blue-dyed film.\n    At last, when it was time for the film to be shown, the three dyed films would be layered on top of one another, to make &#39;glorious technicolor.&#39; This is why, especially in the early films, the coloring looks so painterly. It&#39;s also why most early films nearly cause eyestrain \u2014 especially the famous film  The Wizard of Oz. The Technicolor process was expensive, not just because of the camera and the technicians needed to film, but the many incidental technical issues. Some colors, if they were too subtle, would suddenly pop out as other colors. Yellows would turn green in random patches, if too much of the wrong color was filtered out. And since the beam of light entering the camera was split between multiple films, only a fraction of the light in the studio made it onto any one film. This meant that the studio needed to be extra bright. Many regulars on  The Wizard of Oz complained of eye damage from the studio lights, that lasted years.\n  Mostly, though, it meant that production teams didn&#39;t want to waste a single opportunity for color. In the books, Dorothy&#39;s slippers were silver, and the yellow brick road, silver slippers, and emerald green city were said to represent the gold standard, silverites, and paper money. But silver slippers were no fun at all on film. They might as well be filmed in black and white. Red, however, was easy to see, eye-catching, and didn&#39;t wreak havoc with the color mixing \u2014 the way the famed yellow-brick road often did. Hence the ruby slippers, which made the most of Technicolor, and an American fairy-tale was changed forever.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:18:22", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

......", "note_en": "At the conclusion of  my previous article on Sierra Online\u2019s corporate history, we saw how Ken and Roberta Williams moved their company\u2019s headquarters from the tiny Northern California town of Oakhurst to the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, home to Microsoft among others, in September of 1993. They did so for a mixture of personal and professional reasons, as Ken has since acknowledged. Their children were getting older, for one thing, and the schools in Oakhurst were far from world-class. Additionally, life in general as the biggest fish of all in the fishbowl of a company town that Oakhurst had become wasn\u2019t always pleasant; for example, Ken has claimed that his kids were at times bullied by \u201cthe children of former Sierra employees who had a grudge against Sierra.\u201d Some other former employees suspect still another reason for the move to Bellevue, one that Ken neglects to mention: the fact that Washington State had no personal income tax, while California\u2019s was the highest in the nation.\n Still, there are no grounds to doubt that the public reason Ken gave for the move back in the day was indeed a major part of the calculation: the need to recruit the sort of seasoned business talent that could take Sierra to the next level. The company\u2019s annual revenues had grown every single year since 1987, more often than not substantially, and this was of course wonderful. But less wonderful was the fact that profits had never been as high as that progression would imply; Sierra had a knack for spending almost every dime they earned. Of late in fact, the bottom line had dipped sharply into loss territory even as revenues continued their steady climb. Under pressure from his shareholders, Ken Williams realized that he had to find a way to make his company start to pay off. He believed that doing so must entail assembling the kind of top-flight management team which could only be found in a big city. He\u2019d been seeking a rock star of a chief financial officer for a long time from Oakhurst to no avail. Ken Williams:\n I had hired a San Francisco-based company, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, to lead the search, and after months of getting nowhere I called my contact at Heidrick in frustration. \u201cWhy do you keep sending me B and C level candidates?\u201d I asked. I was tired of having my time wasted interviewing candidates who were not at the level I was seeking. The answer came back without hesitation: \u201cKen, you\u2019re aren\u2019t getting it. No A player wants to move to Oakhurst.\u201d\n Nine months after the move to Bellevue, Ken finally found his rock star in the form of one Mike Brochu, a financial whizz who had spent the last nineteen years working for Burlington Resources. The man whom Ken still describes as \u201cprobably the best hire I ever made\u201d was a garrulous Texan who \u201cinspired confidence in everyone around him.\u201d Not coincidentally, Sierra began to display a newly hard-nosed, bottom-line-focused attitude toward their business from virtually the moment of his arrival. As one of his first projects, Brochu led the negotiations that resulted in the sale of  The ImagiNation Network, Sierra\u2019s visionary but perpetually money-losing online-gaming service, to AT&amp;T for $40 million in cash in November of 1994.\n Meanwhile Sierra implemented a significant shift in their product-development strategy. For many years now, the heart of the company\u2019s identity had been a set of long-running adventure-game series, most of which worked the word \u201cquest\u201d somewhere into their title. Dodgy from the standpoints of both writing and design though they sometimes were, they\u2019d all displayed enough lovable qualities to worm their way into fans\u2019 hearts. I\u2019ve described in earlier articles how Sierra fandom could feel like belonging to a big extended family. These games, then, were the cousins whom you could always expect to see at the family reunion every couple of years, dressed perhaps a bit differently than last time around but always the same person at bottom. They were comfortingly predictable, and that was exactly how the fans liked them.\n But for all that these ramshackle, puzzle-heavy adventure games were good at cementing the loyalty of the already converted, they were less equipped to unleash the sort of explosive growth Sierra was now after. It was a pivotal moment in the history of the personal computer, as Ken Williams and Mike Brochu well recognized. In 1994, more home computers would be sold than televisions, as consumers, tempted by the ease of use of  Microsoft Windows, the magic of multimedia, and rumors of a thing called the World Wide Web, jumped onboard the computing bandwagon in staggering numbers. These people didn\u2019t know a  King\u2019s Quest from an  Ultima. Reaching them would require a different sort of game: fresher,  hotter in the Marshall McLuhan sense, more in tune with what they were seeing on television and at the movies. It seemed like it was now or never for Sierra to capture their interest, even if it meant that some of the old fans were left feeling a bit abandoned.\n So, Sierra\u2019 new Bellevue management team took a hard look at their existing series in order to decide which were expendable and which were not.   King\u2019s Quest, the company\u2019s longstanding flagship series, which already enjoyed a measure of name recognition outside the traditional computer-gaming ghetto, would have been an obvious keeper even if it hadn\u2019t been the baby of Roberta Williams.   Leisure Suit Larry also had proven appeal with non-traditional demographics, and was thus also a no-brainer to keep around.   Space Quest was an edge case, but the managers decided to green-light one more game, if only to throw a bone to the old-school fans. But   Police Quest would get revamped from a line of adventure games into a line of tactical 3D action games, while   Quest for Glory would get the axe entirely. Going forward, the main focus would be on bigger-budget adventures employing filmed human actors, for which Sierra was now building their own sound stage down in Oakhurst at considerable cost. They would make fewer of this new type of adventure, but each of them would be a flashy, high-fidelity production, able to appeal to a mass market weaned on big-screen televisions and CD players. The idea was to make the release of each Sierra adventure from now on a real  event.\n Unfortunately, the transition from one product strategy to another came with a pitfall: it would take some time to bring it off, meaning that 1994 would be an unusually quiet year in terms of new games. And that reality, combined with the new management team\u2019s more hard-nosed attitude, meant that some of the folks in Oakhurst must lose their jobs. Among them were Corey and Lori Cole, the husband-and-wife team behind  Quest for Glory, who saw their roles cancelled along with the fifth game in their series, the most impressive of all the series in the Sierra lineup in terms of design ambition and innovation. Corey recalls a scene which made it all too clear to everyone present that Sierra was now being run as a business, not a family: \u201cAll employees in the meeting were handed envelopes; about half of them contained \u2018pink slips\u2019 notifying them that they no longer worked for Sierra. Those employees were escorted back into the building and watched as they retrieved personal belongings from their desks.\u201d Layoffs are never easy. Corey especially remembers the sight of Gano Haine, who had worked on Sierra\u2019s  two  EcoQuest games and  Pepper\u2019s Adventures in Time, standing in the parking lot crying: \u201cSierra had been her dream, and she was so thrilled to have gotten the job there.\u201d\n During this year of wrenching transition, Sierra released just one new Oakhurst-built adventure game, making it their least prolific year in that respect in almost a decade. Thankfully for the bean counters, the game in question was the latest installment in Sierra\u2019s most bankable adventure series of them all.  King\u2019s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride was a typical entry in a series that had been Sierra\u2019s ever-evolving technological showpiece since 1984. But then, that description in itself implies innovation on at least a technical front, and this the new entry certainly delivered.\n  Although it did not employ filmed actors,  King\u2019s Quest VII was indicative in another way of Sierra\u2019s new direction: rather than an interactive movie, it aimed to be an interactive cartoon worthy of comparison to the likes of Disney, an ambition which required it to look beyond Sierra\u2019s own stable of talented in-house artists for some of its visuals. Ken Williams first reached out to an up-and-coming animation studio known as Pixar. He even spoke personally with Steve Jobs, Pixar\u2019s chairman and majority owner, but in the end the studio proved to be simply too busy working on  Toy Story, their first full-length feature film, to take on this task as well. So, Sierra ended up contracting sequences out to no fewer than four other outside animation studios, in addition to employing their own artists to create what truly was an audiovisual extravaganza by the standards of its time.  King\u2019s Quest VII went full Disney, as Charles Ardai described in his review for  Computer Gaming World magazine.\n I tried this game on my mother (a big fairy-tale fan), who asked, \u201cIs that a game from Disney?\u201d When I replied in the negative, she said, \u201cBut they\u2019re trying to do Disney, right?\u201d\n They are indeed. From the opening frames, where drops of dew in an enchanted forest drop on the tummy of an enchanted ladybug, to the scene a few seconds later in which lovely Princess Rosella sings her royal heart out in a tuneful paean to her about-to-be-lost adolescence, King\u2019s Quest VII exudes Disney-like quality from each of its cel-animated poses.\n Every frame is beautiful, every line is neat and pert, the camera soars and glides, and the notes of the musical score tinkle out in bounding effervescence like the fizz out of a bottle of soda pop. This is the Disney of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, or Aladdin, if you deduct that film\u2019s adult-targeted sense of irony. It\u2019s the Disney of The Sword in the Stone and of Alice in Wonderland, light and fluffy as a souffl\u00e9. It\u2019s not the Disney of Bambi or Snow White; here even the menaces are adorable bits of whimsy. If the villains ever frighten, it\u2019s only for a brief time, and then everyone gets together again for one more song.\n It matters not at all that the game is from Sierra rather than Disney. It is true to the Disney spirit.\n Along with the mouth-watering new look, the game showed some welcome design evolution over Robera Williams\u2019s earlier work. Four years after LucasArts\u2019s   The Secret of Monkey Island had pointed the way,  King\u2019s Quest VII finally managed to free itself from the countless hidden dead ends that had always made playing a Roberta Williams game feel like playing make-believe with a sadist. Player deaths, on the other hand, were still copious, and still so unclued as to be essentially random, but were now at least relatively painless. Rather than expecting you to save every five minutes, the game was now kind enough to return you to the point you were at before you were so foolish as to look at the wrong thing or dilly-dally in the wrong room a second too long. In fact, save files as such disappeared altogether; exiting the game now automatically bookmarked your progress.\n  These changes all existed in the name of making the game more welcoming to brand new players, out of the hope that they could be convinced to give it a try despite the ominous Roman numeral after its name. To further emphasize that this was a kinder, gentler  King\u2019s Quest, it used a radically simplified interface built around a one-click-does-it-all mouse cursor. More oddly, Sierra made it possible to play any of its chapters at any time, meaning you could start with the climax and work backward to the prologue if you were so inclined. (The real point of this feature, of course, was to let you watch each chapter\u2019s opening movie without having to get your hands dirty with the actual game, if you happened to be one of the many people who typically bought each new  King\u2019s Quest as a tech demo for their latest computer.)\n But alas, in other ways this latest entry really was just another  King\u2019s Quest. The writing from Roberta Williams and Lorelei Shannon, her latest apprentice co-designer, was the usual scattershot blend of fairy-tale and pop-culture ephmera, lacking sufficient wit or imagination to be all that compelling even as pastiche, while the puzzle design was made less infuriating than usual only by the lack of dead-player-walking situations. Both the writing and the puzzles got noticeably worse as the game wore on, evidence perhaps of a lead designer who was feeling increasingly bored with her big series, and was in fact already working on her next, very different game. All of this was doubly disappointing coming on the heels of  King\u2019s Quest VI, a game which had seemed to herald a series that was at last beginning to take its craft a bit more seriously. Even the much-vaunted look of  King\u2019s Quest VII, although impressive in its individual parts, made for a rather discordant jumble when taken in the aggregate, being the work of so many different teams of animators.\n Nevertheless,  King\u2019s Quest VII sold very well upon its release in November of 1994, as games in the series always did. Meanwhile Dynamix, the most consistent of Sierra\u2019s subsidiary studios, delivered solid performers in the non-adventure games   Aces of the Deep,   Front Page Sports: Football \u2018Pro 95, and   Metaltech: EarthSiege. Most of all, though, it was the ImagiNation windfall that turned what would otherwise have been an ugly year into one that actually looked pretty good on the bottom line: $83.4 million in revenues, up from $59.5 million in 1993, with an accompanying $12 million profit, in contrast to an $8.6 million loss the previous year. Now it was up to the new product strategy to keep the party going in 1995.\n The first big test of that strategy was to be the game that Roberta Williams had been working on concurrently with  King\u2019s Quest VII.  Phantasmagoria would take full advantage of the Oakhurst sound stage Sierra had just built. It was to be a play against type worthy of any pop diva: Roberta, the family-friendly \u201cqueen of adventure gaming,\u201d was going  dark  and  sexy. \u201cWith  Phantasmagoria,\u201d wrote Sierra\u2019s marketers, \u201cRoberta Williams has created a superbly written interactive story, fraught with horror and suspense, and totally in the player\u2019s control at all times.\u201d Bill Crow, the mastermind of Sierra\u2019s new sound stage, believed that \u201c Phantasmagoria is going to open the market to a much broader audience of game players. We\u2019re now starting to deliver an audiovisual experience that\u2019s much closer to what the average consumer can relate to.\u201d With  Phantasmagoria, in other words, computer games were about to burst out of their nerdy ghetto to become sophisticated entertainments for discerning adults.\n How times do change. Today  Phantasmagoria is more or less a laughingstock, a tidy microcosm of everything that was wrong with the full-motion-video era of adventure games. In truth, some of its bad rap is a bit exaggerated; it\u2019s not really any worse than dozens of other similarly dated productions of the mid-1990s. Certainly plenty of other games had equally cheesy acting, equally clueless writing, and equally trivial gameplay.  Phantasmagoria\u2018s modern reputation for hilarious ineptitude stems to a large extent from its mainstream prominence in its heyday. The wave of hype that Sierra unleashed, much of it issuing from the mouth of Roberta herself, is catnip for snarky reviewers like yours truly, who can\u2019t help but throw it all back in her face. \u201cI want to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions,\u201d Roberta said. But  Phantasmagoria is so very, very much not that kind of game. If you squint just right, you can see what she was trying to create: a game of claustrophobic psychological horror, an interactive version of  The Shining. But alas, nobody involved had the chops to pull it off.\n Phantasmagoria revolves around a couple of artsy newlyweds named Adrienne and Don, a novelist and a photographer respectively. As the story begins, they\u2019ve just moved into a rambling old mansion on a sparsely inhabited island off the coast of New England. They\u2019re the first people to attempt to live in the house, we soon learn, in almost a century. The last person to do so before them was a strange stage magician named Carno the Magnificent, who went through pretty young wives at a prodigious rate \u2014 all of them abruptly disappearing from the island, never to be seen again. In the end, Carno himself disappeared, and that was that for the house until our heroes turn up. It comes as a surprise to absolutely no one except them when the place turns out to be haunted by a malevolent spirit. It quickly begins to take over the mind of Don, leaving Adrienne, the character the player controls, to try to sort out the mystery before her husband murders her like Carno killed all of his wives.\n Somewhat surprisingly in light of Sierra\u2019s mass-market aspirations, they never attempted to hire \u201cname\u201d actors for  Phantasmagoria in the way that Origin Systems was  doing at the time for the  Wing Commander franchise. The role of Adrienne went to Victoria Morsell, whom Sierra rather ambitiously described as a \u201cfilm, TV, and theater star,\u201d having apparently confused bit parts with starring ones. Still, she does a decent job within the awkward constraints of her task. David Homb in the role of Don, on the other hand, is just awful; his wooden performance comes off as more creepy before the horror starts, when he\u2019s trying to play a loving husband and failing at it abjectly, than it does after his head starts metaphorically spinning around. The rest of the cast is a similarly mixed bag.\n Sierra hired a director named Peter Maris, with a long run of schlocky ultra-low-budget films behind him, for a shoot that wound up taking fully four months. Even given that his oeuvre wasn\u2019t exactly of Oscar caliber, his complete disregard for pacing is bizarre.  Phantasmagoria\u2018s seven CDs \u2014 yes,  seven \u2014 are filled with interminable sequences where Adrienne disassembles a brick chimney piece by piece, or breaks through a wooden door board by board, or applies her morning makeup layer by agonizing layer. Indeed, Adrienne insists on stopping and preening herself at each of the many mirrors in the house throughout the game, and we\u2019re forced to watch and wait while she does so, hoping against hope that something interesting might happen this around. (For all of Roberta Williams\u2019s status as a female pioneer in a male-dominated industry, her games\u2019 view of gender isn\u2019t always the most progressive.) All of this, combined with the clumsy, overly wordy script, makes the game seem much longer than the few hours it actually takes to play. There\u2019s a (bad) 90-minute horror flick worth of plot-advancing footage here at the best; Sierra could easily have ditched three of the seven CDs without losing much at all.\n The much-vaunted \u201cadult\u201d content is rather less than it\u2019s cracked up to be. The opening movie includes the least sexy sex scene in the history of media. Ken Williams says that it was originally to have shown Adrienne topless, but Sierra lost their nerve in the end: \u201cWhen it came time to release the game, we edited it to only show some side boob.\u201d Given how weird and awkward it already is, we can only be thankful for their last-minute fit of prudishness.\n Nor is the game remotely scary, although it does get gruesome \u2014 a very different quality \u2014 from time to time. These sequences come when Adrienne is visited by visions of the murders that took place long ago in the different rooms of the house, or, in the latter stages of the game, when she herself meets an unfortunate end thanks to a failure on the player\u2019s part. For better or for worse, \n......", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:18:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u652f\u4ed8,sierra", "title":

The whole point of Clubhouse is to be seen. It doesn\u2019t matter who speaks or what they say. It matters that they are seen as high status people.\n Clubhouse rose to prominence when no one could be seen in person. Everyone was stuck in their homes. Someone with a high reputation, credibility, or value to a group couldn\u2019t flex their status in person. They couldn\u2019t brag in person about the work they were doing, signal how smart they were, or tell you about their role at some cool company. Clubhouse was a way to be seen with other high status people, especially in circles like tech and crypto.\n Now that high status people can be seen in person again, they are spending less time on Clubhouse. Lower status people are left trying to be seen amongst themselves. Without high status people, Clubhouse is not serving its purpose of helping people be seen. It is a cargo cult: low status people recreating the actions of high status people, after they have left, thinking it will cause them to be high status.\n  The relics of the status games are in the design. Even before you enter a room, Clubhouse shows you the people you follow in it. A user can judge the status of a room based on its size, the status of the speakers, and the status of any people they follow. High status people are often the most followed so they guide the discovery. Without these people, discovery is gamed and less relevant.\n Each room has status games being played within it as well. If you look at other live social apps, audiences generally do something like chat or react. On Clubhouse, anyone not talking has nothing to do except listen and look at other members of the room. When you look at the screen, you\u2019ll see every room is a hierarchy. The important people on top, their support in the middle, and the audience on the bottom.\n The important people are on stage. It is the highest form of being seen. In big rooms, if you are on stage, everyone\u2019s attention is on you, even if you aren\u2019t speaking. These people literally are at the top and take up the most space, having the largest avatars only three to a row. Their status increases by being there with high status people. This is the ultimate goal of a status-seeking Clubhouse user.\n The next level of the hierarchy is the status support group. It is a designated zone for the group of people who the speakers follow. If high status people are here, it means the people on stage must be very high status. They provide extra credibility for those on stage and help the room get discovered by more people.\n For example, a startup founder is speaking in a room and a prominent venture capitalist is in the audience. If that VC knows the company, there isn\u2019t any new information going to be shared, but there is status to doing it. It is beneficial to the status of both the speaker (founder) and the status support member (VC) to be there. The venture capitalist\u2019s authority rubs off on the speakers, making them seem more legitimate.\n  The lowest in the hierarchy is the audience. These people are so far down the hierarchy they are rarely ever seen in large rooms. Anyone who wants to be seen and gain status should try to leave this area. People are here because they are truly interested in the conversation or are trying to move up the hierarchy so they can gain status. Low status audience members rarely get a chance to engage in big rooms. They are status fodder for people up the hierarchy.\n  Now that the high status people are mostly gone, lower status people fill all levels and try to recreate the dynamics. The design of Clubhouse is still the same. People try to be seen on stage in popular rooms. Organizers try to optimize their room to be recommended. Users fill their bio with interests and topics they care about. All of this is diluted because the people with status aren\u2019t there anymore. The status and recognition people want is not there.\n There are fewer \u201cmust-listen\u201d rooms with massive audiences. Rooms are smaller and driven by interests or topics, rather than the people involved. The recommendation algorithm, which is driven by people you follow, is less relevant. Following lists are increasingly filled with low status people who are active on Clubhouse rather than high status people from the real world. The exclusivity from launching as invite and iPhone only is wearing off now that anyone can join including Android users. Clubhouse is not the high status place to be seen anymore.\n A way to illustrate this is the decline in fear of missing out on Clubhouse. Few people think they are missing anything by not being there. Compared to its peak when people were buying invites, sending them to their closest friends, spending hours on the platform, and talking about it on social media, Clubhouse doesn\u2019t have the same magic it once did.\n High status people can now be seen together in exclusive places in real life. In person parties and events are impossible to compete with. It also doesn\u2019t help that Clubhouse is being copied by seemingly every other big tech company. Everyone wants to recreate the magic Clubhouse had.\n Can Clubhouse ever recreate the magic of being a high status place to be seen? They can try. For every category of people, not only in tech and crypto, they must become \u201cthe place\u201d to be seen with other high status people. High status people must want to flex their status and share it with others on the platform. If this happened, the low status cargo cult members would gain the status boost they\u2019re looking for.\n The other option is to embrace the lower status people. Many interesting rooms and behaviours are happening outside the big ones. Recent releases like  messaging give hints they are moving away from only being a \u201cplace to be seen.\u201d The app has the potential to be the mass audio social network. This was likely the plan all along, and they had a lucky break with the \u201cplace to be seen\u201d diversion.\n Either way, people always want to be seen. Clubhouse, for a moment, captured that need. To succeed as once thought, they need to do it again at a larger scale or embrace the behaviours of lower status people. If not, the cargo cult of Clubhouse will continue.\n  Thanks to  Jesse Germinario,  Steven Ovadia,  Padmini Pyapali,  Diana Klatt,  Kat Dee, Stacey King Gordon, and Christine Cauthen from  Foster for the feedback.", "posttime": "2021-08-07 02:17:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8d27\u7269,cargo,\u5730\u4f4d", "title": "\u4f1a\u6240\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8d27\u7269\u5d07\u62dc", "title_en": "Clubhouse Is a Cargo Cult", "transed": 1, "url": "https://ianvanagas.com/2021/08/06/clubhouse-is-a-cargo-cult/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d27\u7269", "cargo", "\u5730\u4f4d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1071816, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u90e8\u7535\u8bdd\u3002\u4e0d\u662f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u60f3\u88ab\u76d1\u89c6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 CalyxOS \u6536\u56de\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u3002 CalyxOS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd Android \u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7f6e\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u7528\u6237\u7684\u624b\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u5efa\u8bae\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u8ba9\u60a8\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u731c\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002 \u270c\ufe0f microG \u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86 Google Play \u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u533f\u540d\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u9009\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u8fd1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u65e5\u8bb0\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7528\u6237\u662f\u8c01\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e0b\u8f7d\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\uff01\u4e0b\u8f7d PDF \u516b\u6708\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u3002\u5b83\u4e0e Special Pixel 4a \u7248\u672c (2.7.1) \u57fa\u672c\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u8865\u5145\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u5b98\u65b9 CalyxOS \u7248\u672c\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u79c1\u94a5\u7b7e\u540d\u3002\u65e0\u7ebf (OTA) \u66f4\u65b0\u4e5f\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u5b89\u88c5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5b89\u88c5\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u5bc6\u94a5\u7b7e\u540d\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\n\u67e5\u770b\u66f4\u591a CalyxOS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531 Calyx Institute \u8d5e\u52a9\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5f00\u6e90\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\uff0cCalyx Institute \u662f\u4e00\u5bb6 501(c)(3) \u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u52a0\u5165", "note_en": "Everyone needs a phone.
