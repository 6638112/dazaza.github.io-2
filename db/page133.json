The OnePlus 8 was part of the phone-maker&#39;s 2020 lineup. Though the OnePlus 8 Pro was bigger in size and spec, the high-level specs on this standard model still make it a decent flagship phone in 2021. OnePlus phones have generally appealed to us by offering flagship-level specs and performance for less than the ever-ballooning price of most high-end smartphones. This year\u2019s Prime Day sale takes the $500-600\u00a0 OnePlus 8 down to $349, a much more competitive price that again gives more expensive (and less expensive) phones a run for their money.\n Just looking at the spec sheet, you can see that\u2014with 5G support (on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile), a 6.55-inch 402 pixels-per-inch OLED display with a 90 Hz refresh rate, 8GB RAM (albeit of the slower LPDDR4X variety), 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage, and Qualcomm\u2019s 2020 flagship Snapdragon 865 processor\u2014the OnePlus 8 is a phone that remains competitive. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no removable storage, though that&#39;s not out of the ordinary in 2021.\n     There are big specs in the battery and camera department, as well. The 4,300 mAh battery uses OnePlus\u2019 Warp Charge technology to juice the phone from 1 percent to half-full in 22 minutes, according to the company, and it tends to last about a day under normal usage. Wireless charging is not available, though. To allow for varying shots and artistic expression, the camera array includes three different cameras: one with a standard lens, one with a macro lens, and one with an ultrawide-angle lens. The cameras range from decent to not so great, though we had a few surprisingly good moments in\u00a0 our experience with the phone.\n  Thankfully, OnePlus is  one of the better phone OEMs with regard to Android updates: the updates usually land within a few weeks of each release, though the company often lags 1 to 3 months behind on security updates. The company&#39;s Oxygen OS still looks good and makes useful customizations to the Android operating system, but because the OnePlus 8 is already a year old, you should only expect one more major software update  for Android 12 and a little less than two years of security updates.

As an independent producer of films and TV a company can secure its own licensing deals and operate in direct competition with similar businesses. As a subsidiary of Amazon, it would likely be in large part reduced to an in-house production company for the retail and web giant, not competing on the merits of its products but as part of a multi-industry empire.\n FTC Chair Lina Khan \u2014  appointed just last week \u2014 has been among the foremost critics of the latter business model. Her now famous \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox\u201d paper asserted that Amazon uses dominance in one industry, like AWS in web hosting, to shore up other less successful arms, like its nascent delivery service. If the latter would fail without the support of the former, the argument (roughly) goes, the company is potentially engaging in anti-competitive behavior enabled by market power.\n That the market power and the behavior are in different verticals excused it under the antitrust doctrine of the recent era (so long as consumers didn\u2019t see price increases), but Khan aimed to challenge that doctrine with her paper \u2014 and now, as one of the most powerful regulators in the country, she has been given the chance to shape it firsthand.\n  Such large deals are always reviewed by federal authorities, and in this case the FTC is reportedly in charge, probably because it has already taken on the role of antitrust investigation into Amazon in other circumstances. It\u2019s also handling Facebook (which it has tangled with repeatedly over the years), while the agency\u2019s enforcement partners at the Justice Department took charge of looking into Google and Apple. (The FTC declined to comment, saying it does not confirm the existence of investigations.)\n In this case it seems unlikely that the Amazon purchase of MGM will be blocked, seeing as there is certainly real competition in the space and MGM has not been able to make its own way \u2014 a sale is almost inevitable. But the review will take place nonetheless, and it will likely elucidate how the FTC has changed its approach to this type of merger.\n It\u2019s entirely possible that even in a light-touch approval of this deal there will be opportunity to see new doctrine in play; for example, Amazon\u2019s arguably monopolistic position in ostensibly unrelated markets is likely to take a greater role than under previous FTC leadership. It may even set the stage for more comprehensive and aggressive reviews to come, or perhaps even rewinding previously approved mergers, something Chair Khan  has said is a distinct possibility.",

significant as it recognizes that Intel will be enabling SiFive\u2019s IP portfolio on its 7nm manufacturing process for upcoming foundry customers. We are expecting Intel to offer a wide variety of its own IP, such as some of the x86 cores, memory controllers, PCIe controllers, and accelerators, however the depth of its third party IP support has not been fully established at this point. SiFive\u2019s IP is the first (we believe) official confirmation of specific IP that will be supported.\n    Announced earlier this year by Pat Gelsinger, Intel Foundry Services (or IFS) is one prong of Intel\u2019s strategy to realign itself with the current and future semiconductor market. Despite having attempted to become a foundry player in the past, whereby they build chips under contract for their customers, it hasn\u2019t really worked out that well \u2013 however IFS is a new reinvigoration of that idea, this time with more emphasis on getting it right and expanding the scope.\n  To that end, Intel has been reorganizing its manufacturing and operations hierarchy into its own vertical group under Keyvan Esfarjani, with IFS led by Randhir Thakur as President reporting to this group.  As reported by CRN in the past week, Intel has recently hired a number of key talents from its foundry competition to aid this transition, including Hong Hao, the former head of Samsung\u2019s North American foundry business, to \u2018 formulate business strategies and execute customer engagement plans\u2019. Intel has also hired Bob Brennan, a former 22 year Intel employee most recently at Micron, as Vice President of Customer Design Enablement at IFS, assisting with end-to-end contract-to-product solutions for IFS customers. This includes engagement with Intel\u2019s Design Engineering Group, putting customers on the right track with Intel roadmaps.\n    Simply offering Intel\u2019s portfolio of technologies alone to customers isn\u2019t going to entice many customers, and in order to compete with other foundry competition, Intel needs to engage with other IP holders to provide design kits and tools for other technologies. For example, if an Intel Foundry Services customer wants to use an Intel core paired with a third party memory controller on Intel\u2019s 14nm process, that third party memory controller design has to be validated at Intel. Similarly, if a customer wants to combine Arm cores or other accelerators, that IP has to be validated. Intel has to create a structure of supported IP aside from their own, and today\u2019s announcement is one of the initial steps to that.\n    Today\u2019s announcement from SiFive is the launch of a new family of \u2018Performance\u2019 cores, debuting with the P270 and the P550. Both cores are Linux capable, with full support for the RISC-V vector extension v1.0rc, and the P550 is SiFive\u2019s highest performance core ever with a reported SPEC2006 int score of 8.65 per GHz. As part of that announcement, Intel is the lead development partner of the P550 core on Intel\u2019s own 7nm process. That\u2019s what the press release says.\n  In our emails with PR however, the wording was a little loose, and stated that\n  Intel recently selected SiFive to work with the Intel Foundry Services (IFS) business  to offer IP to Foundry customers. As part of the growth and development of the IFS business, IFS is creating \u2026 the P550 on the Intel 7nm.\n  The first sentence is critical here; it broadens the scope of the initial press release beyond simple co-operation of a singular IP core (the P550) into something more encompassing. The first step on such an endeavor would obviously be a proof point, such as enabling the P550, but then going beyond to other elements of SiFive\u2019s portfolio. How wide the scope is beyond the P550 has not been commented on at this time, however if all goes well, we could easily imagine a wide remit for SiFive solutions at any foundry.\u00a0 It should be noted that some musings have been made that Intel might be trying to acquire SiFive, however nothing that AnandTech could confirm or get comment on \u2013 the fact that the two companies are putting this announcement out today might dampen those rumors a little.\n  The fact that the press release also mentions 7nm is an interesting angle. We\u2019re covering what Intel is making with SiFive P550 in a separate news article, as it is big enough news to get its own title.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:49:26", "source_domain":

Reddit, the self-proclaimed front page of the internet, is determining what should and should not appear on its feeds.\n  When it comes to content moderation, which has become an ever more high-profile problem in recent years, Reddit opts for a different approach compared to other large social platforms.\n  Unlike Facebook, for example, which outsources much of the work to moderation farms, Reddit relies in large part on its communities (or subreddits) to self-police. The efforts of volunteer moderators are guided by rules defined by each individual subreddit, but also a   set of values authored and enforced by Reddit itself.\n  The company has come under criticism for this model, though, which some have interpreted as laissez-faire and lacking in accountability. But Chris Slowe, Reddit CTO, says this is a total mischaracterization.\n  \u201cIt may seem like a crazy thing to say about the internet today, but humans on average are actually pretty good. If you look at Reddit at scale, people are creative, funny, collaborative and derpy - all the things that make civilization work,\u201d he told  TechRadar Pro.\n  \u201cOur underlying approach is that we want communities to set their own cultures, policies and philosophical systems. To make this model function, we need to provide tools and capabilities to deal with the [antisocial] minority.\u201d\n  Slowe was the first ever Reddit employee, hired in 2005 as an engineer after renting out two spare rooms to co-founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. The three had met during the first run of now-infamous accelerator program Y Combinator, which left Slowe with fond memories but also a failed startup and time to fill.\n Although he took a break from Reddit between 2010-2015, Slowe\u2019s experience gives him a unique perspective on the growth of the company and how the challenges it faces have changed over time.\n  In the early years, he says, it was all about scaling up infrastructure to deal with traffic growth. But in his second stint, from 2016 to present, the focus has shifted to trust, security and user safety.\n \u201cWe provide users with tools to report content that violates site policies or rules set by moderators, but not everything is reported. And in some cases, the report is an indication that it\u2019s too late,\u201d he explained.\n \u201cWhen I came back in 2016, one of my main jobs was figuring out precisely how Reddit communities operate and defining what makes the site healthy. Once we had identified symptoms of unhealthiness, we worked from there.\u201d\n   Unlike other social platforms, Reddit has a multi-layered approach to content moderation, which is designed to adhere as closely as possible to the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity-first\u201d ethos.\n The most primitive form of content vetting is performed by the users themselves, who wield the power to upvote items they like and downvote those they don\u2019t. However, while this process boosts popular posts and squashes unpopular ones, popularity is not always a mark of propriety.\n The community mods act as the second line of defence and are armed with the power to remove posts and ban users for breaching guidelines or the content policy. The most common subreddit rule, according to Slowe, is essentially \u201cdon\u2019t be a jerk\u201d.\n The company\u2019s annual   Transparency Report, which breaks down all the content removed from Reddit each year, suggests mods are responsible for roughly two-thirds of all post removals.\n To catch any harmful content missed by the mods, there are the Reddit admins, who are employed by the company directly. These staff members perform manual spot checks, but are also armed with technological tools to help identify problem users and police one-on-one interactions that take place in private.\n \u201cThere are a number of signals we use to surface issues and establish whether individual users are trustworthy and have been acting in good faith,\u201d said Slowe. \u201cThe tricky part is that you\u2019ll never catch it all. And that\u2019s partly because  it is always going to be somewhat grey and context-dependent.\u201d\n Asked how this situation could be improved, Slowe explained he is caught in a difficult position; torn between a desire to uphold the company\u2019s community-first policy and knowledge that there are technologies coming to market that could help catch a greater percentage of abuse.\n For example, Reddit is already beginning to employ advanced  natural language processing (NLP) techniques to more accurately assess the sentiment of interactions between users. Slowe also gestured towards the possibility of using AI to analyze images posted to the platform and conceded that a larger quantity of moderation actions will occur without human input as time goes on.\n However, he also warned of the fallibility of these new systems, which are   prone to bias and certainly capable of error, and the challenges they might pose to the Reddit model.\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of terrifying, actually. If we\u2019re talking about this as an enforcement model, it\u2019s the same as putting cameras literally everywhere and relying on the great overmind of the machine to tell us when there\u2019s a crime,\u201d he said.\n Although erecting a technological panopticon might limit the amount of unsavory material that lands on the platform, doing so would ultimately require Reddit to cast aside its core philosophy: community above content.\n   Content moderation is a problem that none of the social media giants can claim to have nailed, as demonstrated by the debate surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s accounts and the banning of Parler from app stores. Reddit was also caught up in these conversations, eventually taking the decision to ban the r/DonaldTrump subreddit.\n As powerful as the community-first model may be, there is significant conflict at the heart of Reddit\u2019s approach. The company aspires to give its communities near-total autonomy, but is ultimately forced to make editorial decisions about where to draw the line.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the arbitrary, capricious arbiter of what content is correct and what\u2019s not,\u201d Slowe told us. \u201cBut at the same time, we need to be able to enforce a set of [rules]. It\u2019s a very fine line to walk.\u201d\n Reddit tries to keep its content policy as succinct as possible to eliminate loopholes and make enforcement easier, but revisions are common. For example, revenge pornography was banned on the platform in 2015 under ex-CEO Ellen Pao. Last year, the company added a clause that outlawed the glorification of violence.\n \u201cBeing true to our values also means iterating our values, reassessing them as we encounter new ways to game the system and push the edges,\u201d explained Slowe.\n \u201cWhen we make a change that involves moving communities from one side of the line to the other, that is the end of a long process of figuring out holes in our content policy and working backwards from there.\u201d\n However, while the majority will agree that the absence of revenge porn is an unqualified positive, and that incitement of violence took place on r/The_Donald, both examples are evidence that Reddit has to engage with moderation on the same plane as Facebook, Twitter or any other platform.\n When hard questions need to be asked, in other words, Reddit has found it needs to rely on its own muscle.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:48:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5229\u7528,moderation,reddit", "title": "Reddit\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u793e\u533a - \u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u7528\u6237\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5916\u5305\u5ba1\u6838\u573a ", "title_en": "How Reddit uses its community-first approach to moderate content, relying heavily on its users instead of outsourced moderation farms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/in/news/how-reddit-turned-its-millions-of-users-into-a-content-moderation-army", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5229\u7528", "reddit"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067525, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0b\u8f7dPDF\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334; uncthed castle\uff06\uff0334;\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b49\u751a\u81f3\u4ecd\u7136\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u96c6\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5173\u8282\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f7f\u7528Ajoint Optimization\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684ramensidizers\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e8f\u5217/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c13\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\uff08i\uff09\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u666e\u901a\u7684MLPSSignight MLPS\u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982XGBoost\u3002\n      \u4e66\u76ee\u5de5\u5177\u4ee3\u7801\uff06amp;\u5173\u4e8eArxivlabs Arxivlabs\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u65b0\u7684Arxiv\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n  \u4e0eArxivlabs\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90fd\u63a5\u53d7\u5e76\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u5353\u8d8a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002 Arxiv\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u53ea\u4e0e\u9075\u5b88\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5c06\u589e\u52a0Arxiv\uff06\uff0339;\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u5173Arxivlabs\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Download PDF  Abstract: Tabular datasets are the last &#34;unconquered castle&#34; for deep learning, withtraditional ML methods like Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees still performingstrongly even against recent specialized neural architectures. In this paper,we hypothesize that the key to boosting the performance of neural networks liesin rethinking the joint and simultaneous application of a large set of modernregularization techniques. As a result, we propose regularizing plainMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks by searching for the optimalcombination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using ajoint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and theirsubsidiary hyperparameters. We empirically assess the impact of theseregularization cocktails for MLPs on a large-scale empirical study comprising40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that (i) well-regularized plain MLPssignificantly outperform recent state-of-the-art specialized neural networkarchitectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong traditional ML methods,such as XGBoost.\n      Bibliographic Tools      Code &amp; Data      Related Papers       About arXivLabs   arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n  Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n  Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv&#39;s community?
