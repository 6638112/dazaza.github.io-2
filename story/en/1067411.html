(Note: the first company is CB Insights.)</p><p>      这也是我开始领导第二家公司的那一天 - 他的公司。 （注意：第一家公司是CB Insights。）</p><p> His company was in India (a country I knew little about) in the chemical manufacturing industry (an industry I knew nothing about).</p><p> 他的公司在印度（一个我知道的国家）在化学制造业（一个我对我不认识的行业一无所知）。</p><p>  While I don’t think most people would ever find themselves in a similar situation (I certainly hope not), I thought I’d share the story and some of my learnings &amp; observations from that time about business, M&amp;A, teams, India, and assorted miscellaneous thoughts.</p><p>  虽然我不认为大多数人会在类似的情况下发现自己（我当然希望没有），但我以为我会分享我的故事和一些学习＆amp;从那时到来的观察，M＆amp; A，团队，印度和各种各样的杂项。</p><p>  Notes:  This will probably be slightly rambly and stream-of-consciousness as there are lots of thoughts rolling around in my head.</p><p>  注意：这可能会略微变得可靠和溪流，因为有很多想法在我的脑海里遍布。</p><p>      As I was going with family to cremate my father in a traditional Hindu funeral, someone who I didn’t know came up to me and said in Hindi, “  Saab, humara kya hoga? ”</p><p>      正如我和家人在传统的印度葬礼中会火，我不知道的人来找我，并在印地语中说，“萨博，Humara Kya Hoga？ “</p><p>     And I remember thinking to myself, “Why the F are you asking me about this right now?”</p><p>     我记得自己思考，“为什么你现在问我这件事吗？” </p><p> But this wasn’t the time for anger or to even to think about this so I just knee-jerk responded in my heavily American-accented Hindi that “  Meh dekh loonga ” which translates to “I’ll look after it.”</p><p>但这不是愤怒的时候或甚至想到这一点，所以我只是膝盖jerk在我的沉重的印度教中回应了“meh dekh loonga”，翻译成“我照顾它”。</p><p> And so at that point, in addition to CB Insights, I knew I was going to run my Dad’s business. To be honest, I had already thought about this possibility when he was admitted to the hospital when the doctors said the situation was looking dire.</p><p> 所以在那一点上，除了CB Insights之外，我知道我会跑爸爸的生意。说实话，当医生说这种情况看起来很可怕时，我已经想到了这种可能性。</p><p> But no matter my age, Dad was always the strongest, smartest person I knew, and so I assumed he’d pull through and things would go back to normal. With him tirelessly working on Atlas, the company he founded, and me going back to CB Insights.</p><p> 但无论我的年龄，爸爸都是我知道的最强大，最聪明的人，所以我认为他会通过它，事情会回到正常。与他不知疲倦地在阿特拉斯努力，他成立的公司，我回到了CB Insights。</p><p>     Before we go further, a bit of context on Atlas, my Dad’s business.</p><p>     在我们进一步前进之前，我父亲的一系列内容就是在阿特拉斯的业务。</p><p>  The company was recently renamed AIMS Impex, but it started and for most of its life, it was known as Atlas Fine Chemicals. Industry folks know it as Atlas, and my sisters and I grew up knowing it under that name so I will refer to it as Atlas going forward.</p><p>  该公司最近重新命名为Impex，但它开始和大部分生命，它被称为阿特拉斯精细化学品。行业人们知道它是阿特拉斯，我的姐妹们，我在这个名字下很明显，所以我将把它称为阿特拉斯前进。</p><p> Atlas is a manufacturer of specialty flavor &amp; fragrance chemicals such as coumarin, 6-methyl coumarin, safranal, natural vanilla, and cyclocitral among others. Atlas’ customers include the world’s largest flavor &amp; fragrance houses including IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich, Takasago, and Symrise among others.</p><p> 阿特拉斯是一家专业风味＆amp的制造商;香味化学品，如香豆素，6-甲基香豆素，野生醛，天然香草和环形等。阿特拉斯的客户包括世界上最大的味道＆amp;香水房屋包括IFF，Givaudan，Firmenich，Takasago和Symrise等。</p><p> Atlas is based 4 hours from Mumbai in a city called Nasik (1.486 million people) and the manufacturing facility is about 35 minutes from Nasik in a small village called Sinnar.</p><p> 阿特拉斯距离孟买在一个叫做纳西克（14.86亿人）的城市的4小时，距离塞纳尔的小村庄距离Nasik约35分钟。 </p><p>        I don’t remember the exact day I went to the office for the first time as the weeks after April 17th were a blur of family, tradition, and emotion.</p><p>我不记得在4月17日之后的几周是一个家庭，传统和情感的日子，我第一次前往办事处的确切一天。</p><p> Before even stepping foot in the office, I had asked the team to send me the reports they sent to Dad so I could get familiar with the business.</p><p> 在办公室甚至踩到办公室之前，我已经要求团队向我发送他们发送给爸爸的报告，所以我可以熟悉这项业务。</p><p> TBH, I didn’t know what I’d do with these reports, but I figured that acting like I knew what I might be doing might provide some confidence to the team.</p><p> TBH，我不知道我对这些报道做了什么，但我认为表现得像我知道我可能正在做的事情可能会对球队提供一些信心。</p><p> Candidly, my only qualification to run Atlas at this time was that I was the founder’s son.</p><p> 坦率地说，我在这个时候逃跑地图集的唯一资格是我是创始人的儿子。</p><p> I had tried to be the good Indian son back in 1998-2000 and work at Atlas so knew the biz a bit in its earlier days, but 18 years is a long time for a business and my mind was jammed with all sorts of other experiences and ideas since then. My time at Atlas was just a distant memory.</p><p> 我试图成为1998  -  2000年的良好印度儿子，在阿特拉斯工作，所以在早些时候的日子里一点就知道了比目，但是18年是一个很长一段时间，我的思绪被各种各样的经历卡住了从那以后的想法。我在阿特拉斯的时间只是一个遥远的记忆。</p><p> In 1998, moving from the fun of NYC to small town India was tough especially as someone born and brought up in the US. Moreover, I was a know-it-all who had all the answers despite just graduating from college and so my dad’s inability to recognize my genius bothered me.</p><p> 1998年，从纽约的乐趣转向印度小镇，特别是因为某人在美国出生和长大。而且，尽管刚从大学毕业，但我父亲无法承认我的天才困扰我，但我就是一位拥有所有答案的人。</p><p>   I still wonder what Atlas might have become if I could have figured out how to be more of a student and less of an Ivy League douche when I was working with my dad back then. What kind of duo might we have been?</p><p>   我仍然怀疑在我和爸爸一起工作的时候，我弄清楚如何更加学生和少年的联赛冲洗，那么它仍然可以成为什么。我们可能是什么样的二重奏？ </p><p> So, in a strange and sad way, this was an opportunity to finally be the good Indian son and run Dad’s business.</p><p>所以，以一种奇怪而悲伤的方式，这是一个终于成为善良的印度儿子和爸爸的生意的机会。</p><p>    I was referred to as Sir, which is what everyone referred to my father as.</p><p>    我被称为先生，这是每个人都提到我父亲的人。</p><p>  I remember thinking this was odd at the time, and during all my visits to the office subsequently, but in many ways, this sort of cultural deference to the unqualified boss’ son is what enabled Atlas to carry on.</p><p>  我记得当时思考这是奇怪的，在我随后对办公室的一次访问，但在很多方面，这种文化遗嘱对不合格的老板儿子的宣传是启用的阿特拉斯。</p><p> I imagine if the same had happened in the US, there would have been many more questions about my qualifications and capabilities. At Atlas, those conversations might have very well happened, but I doubt it. Or, if they did, these questions weren’t directed to me. I got lucky here.</p><p> 我想象如果在美国发生了同样的事情，就有更多关于我的资格和能力的疑问。在阿特拉斯，那些对话可能很好，但我怀疑它。或者，如果他们这样做，这些问题没有针对我。我在这里幸运了。</p><p> Everyone, for better or worse, assumed I had a clue and was looking for me to develop a plan.</p><p> 每个人都要更好或更糟，假设我有一个线索，正在寻找我制定计划。</p><p>      How does one develop a plan when you don’t understand the business, the science, the industry, the country, and sometimes even the language? (I have passable Hindi but a lot of the local conversations at Atlas were in Marathi which I don’t understand.)</p><p>      当您不了解业务，科学，行业，国家，有时甚至是语言时，如何建立一个计划？ （我已经通过了印地语，但在图拉斯的大量当地对话是我不明白的马拉地赛。）</p><p>   I entertained Option 1 for about 6 weeks. The ill-conceived idea was that I’d figure out how to run both Atlas and CB Insights, going forward with Atlas as the beachhead for a larger industrials business and CB Insights as the first part of a massive technology arm.</p><p>   我娱乐选项1约6周。令人无法虐待的想法是，我弄清楚了如何运行阿特拉斯和CB洞察力，前进，与阿特拉斯作为较大的工业企业和CB见解作为大型技术手臂的第一部分。 </p><p>   In India, you see all these families (Ambani, Birla, Tata, Godrej, Hinduja, etc) who are in every potential business line possible. I figured they all started somewhere. Maybe this would be my starting point.</p><p>在印度，您可以看到所有这些家庭（Ambani，Birla，Tata，Godrej，Hinduja等）可能是可能的。我想他们都开始在某个地方。也许这将是我的起点。</p><p> After about 6 weeks of trying to be present at CB Insights, but doing calls every morning at 6am with the Atlas team and emails every evening responding to the team or to Atlas customers, it became apparent that Option 1 wasn’t feasible.</p><p> 在大约6周后试图出现在CB Insights之后，每天早上凌晨6点打电话，每天晚上凌晨6点，每天晚上回应团队或者到阿特拉斯客户，那么明显的是，选项1是不可行的。</p><p> I kept this 6am morning call/evening email routine going for the last 13 months with CB Insights occupying the middle of the day and every other minute of idle brain time. Needless to say, I’ve aged immeasurably in the last 13 months. My desire to build a multi-industry conglomerate died because the idea was just too tiring.</p><p> 我将这个早上6点凌晨6点呼叫/晚餐常规进行过去13个月，CB Insights占据了一天中间，每隔一分钟的闲置大脑时间。毋庸置疑，我在过去的13个月里难以置信。我渴望建立一个多产业的企业集团死亡，因为这个想法太累了。</p><p>  For a second, I looked at what the company might fetch for its assets. Its land, plant, etc.</p><p>  一秒钟，我看了公司可能会为其资产提取的内容。它的土地，植物等</p><p> I’d never done something like this but I remember hearing about it when Gordon Gecko talked about it in the movie   Wall Street  so figured, why not?</p><p> 我从来没有这样做过这样的事情，但我记得在电影华尔街谈论它的戈登壁虎时听到它，为什么不呢？</p><p>   But this wasn’t a real option ever and was discounted in a few hours.</p><p>   但这不是有史以来的真正选择，几个小时内折扣。</p><p> My dad built this company over 30 years with many of his team having been with him for 20+. Selling the company’s assets, even if feasible, would be me failing his team and him.</p><p> 我父亲在30多年内建造了这家公司，他的许多团队一直和他在一起20+。销售公司的资产，即使是可行的，也是我失败的团队和他。 </p><p>   The third idea was to see if there was someone who could run Atlas with some guidance from Dad’s team and me (assuming I could eventually understand the business). And then give this person the ability to earn more and more equity over time.</p><p>第三个想法是看看是否有一个可以在爸爸的团队和我的一些指导中运行阿特拉斯（假设我最终能够理解业务）。然后让这个人能够随着时间的推移赚取越来越股权。</p><p>  This idea was appealing as it’d let my family continue to be involved with the business while also finding someone capable to take it to the next level.</p><p>  这一想法很有吸引力，因为它让我的家人继续参与业务，同时也发现有能力将其带到一个新的水平。</p><p> The problem here was that I had no network in India from which to even think about finding someone for this role. I spoke with a couple of candidates via introductions but nothing really stuck for them or me. Moving to Nasik was a challenge even for those in India, but that was just a symptom of not finding the right person.</p><p> 这里的问题是我在印度没有网络，甚至想想找到这个角色的人。我通过介绍与几个候选人交谈，但没有任何东西对他们或我来说。搬到纳西克甚至对印度的人来说是一个挑战，但这只是没有找到合适人选的症状。</p><p> This would have been an amazing opportunity for the right person, but it wasn’t in the cards.</p><p> 这对合适的人来说是一个惊人的机会，但它不在卡中。</p><p>   The challenge, however, was that Dad’s business didn’t have too many natural buyers and was considered a small market transaction making it even tougher.</p><p>   然而，挑战是爸爸的业务没有太多的自然买家，被认为是一个小市场交易，使其变得更加强硬。</p><p> And so I didn’t have any control on the M&amp;A side of things.</p><p> 所以我没有对M＆amp的任何控制;事情的一面。</p><p> I focused on running the business and hoped a suitable acquirer would show up. If nobody showed up, I’d keep running it.</p><p> 我专注于运行业务并希望合适的收购者出现。如果没有人出现，我会继续运行它。 </p><p> I gave myself 3 years to run both Atlas and CB Insights, thinking I could maintain the daily schedule of 6am calls and evening emails with India interspersed, with trips every 6-8 weeks before burning out. 3 years was a completely arbitrary timeline.</p><p>我给了自己3年才能运行阿特拉斯和CB洞察力，思考我可以维持凌晨6点呼叫和晚间电子邮件的日常时间表，并在烧毁前每6-8周一次旅行。 3年是一个完全任意的时间表。</p><p> About 6 months in, I realized doing both for that long really wasn’t sustainable for a number of reasons — health, family, and it wasn’t optimal for either CB Insights or Atlas.</p><p> 大约6个月的时间，我意识到这两者都没有因为多种原因而不是可持续的 - 健康，家庭，而且对于CB洞察力或阿特拉斯而言，这并不是最佳。</p><p> But I didn’t know the buyer market and couldn’t control it so I focused on what I could control.</p><p> 但我不知道买方市场，无法控制它，所以我专注于我可以控制的东西。</p><p>    Despite Atlas being very different than CB Insights, the answer about how to run it came to me easier than a lot of the other questions I had over the last 13 months.</p><p>    尽管阿特拉斯比CB Insights非常不同，但关于如何运行它的答案比我过去13个月的许多其他问题更容易。</p><p>       I looked at the financials for Atlas vs peers in the industry and talked to some of my dad’s trusted advisors, and it was apparent that Atlas’ margins were best-in-industry.</p><p>       我看着该行业的阿特拉斯与同行的财务人员，并与一些父亲的可信赖的顾问交谈，显然是阿特拉斯的利润是完善的。</p><p>  Atlas was efficient, and my dad obsessed about margins, foregoing business that was low margin to keep overall profit margins high.</p><p>  阿特拉斯效率高，我爸爸沉迷于边缘，上述业务低保证金，以保持整体利润利润率高。</p><p> It was clear that focusing on the margin side wasn’t the best place for my time or energy.</p><p> 很明显，专注于边缘方面不是我的时间或能量的最佳位置。 </p><p> Plus, most of the efficiency to be gained was in the manufacturing process and that is where I was zero value-add. Dad was also the ultimate technical co-founder. I was as non-technical as they come in a chemical manufacturing setting.</p><p>此外，大多数才能获得的效率在制造过程中，这就是我Zero的位置 - 添加。爸爸也是最终的技术联合创始人。我是非技术性的，因为它们进入化学制造环境。</p><p>   And I needed to paint a picture that the team could see. Improving margin by XX basis points wasn’t going to be what got anyone fired up.</p><p>   而且我需要画一张团队可以看到的照片。通过XX基本要点改善边际不会成为让任何人被解雇的东西。</p><p> So I decided to focus on growth. Growth not via new products as that would also require Dad, the technical co-founder.</p><p> 所以我决定专注于增长。由于这款技术联合创始人而不是通过新产品的增长不需要爸爸。</p><p>  This was also the only way to run the company that I had a chance of being useful in.</p><p>  这也是运营公司的唯一方法，我有机会在。</p><p> And it was also the way I could show the Atlas team we were doing well. And that I might have some value beyond being the boss’ son.</p><p> 这也是我可以展示我们做得很好的地图集团队的方式。而且我可能会超越成为老板的儿子的价值。</p><p> Selling is something everyone sees, especially in a manufacturing setting. From the workers at the factory to the plant staff, if they see trucks coming in for product dispatches, they know the product they’re making is selling. If the staff in the office is busy generating invoices and fielding customer calls, they see the product is selling.</p><p> 销售是每个人都看到的东西，特别是在制造环境中。从工厂的工人到工厂的工作人员，如果他们看到卡车进入产品调度，他们知道他们正在制作的产品正在销售。如果办公室的员工正忙于生成发票和现场客户电话，他们会看到产品畅销。</p><p> And while I’m by no means a natural at selling, if armed with the right product, I can sell. And Atlas’ Coumarin was the best in the world.</p><p> 虽然我绝不是自然的销售，但是，如果掌控着合适的产品，我可以卖。而阿特拉斯的香港林是世界上最好的。 </p><p> In the chemical industry, it’s unheard of to be a single product company for 30 years. But Atlas was able to do that because the product is hard to make, and they are the best at it.</p><p>在化学工业中，这是一个闻所未闻的单一产品公司30年。但阿特拉斯能够这样做，因为产品很难做出，而且它们是最好的。</p><p>  Note: It is worth noting that in a competitive chemical product, margins cannot be ignored. So while growth was the focus, I did focus on major expenses — raw materials, shipping, packaging. But this was only 5% of my time as the very capable team at Atlas managed these expertly.</p><p>  注意：值得注意的是，在竞争激烈的化学产品中，不忽视边缘。因此，虽然增长是重点，但我确实专注于主要费用 - 原材料，运输，包装。但这只有5％的时间，因为阿特拉斯的队伍队伍专注地管理了这些时间。</p><p>  So with growth being the focus, I went about assembling a list of people and firms in the industry I should reach out to.</p><p>  因此，随着增长的是重点，我已经完成了我应该伸出援手的行业中的人员和公司名单。</p><p> I went through my dad’s emails to see who he’d interacted with and reached out to all of them.</p><p> 我经历了父亲的电子邮件，看看他谁互动并伸出了所有人。</p><p> I visited various fragrance and flavor association and conference websites and took down their member and attendee names and reached out to them.</p><p> 我参观了各种香水和味道协会和会议网站，并取下了他们的会员和与会者名称并向他们联系。</p><p> It wasn’t a particularly structured process, but I wanted those that knew my dad to know that Atlas was still humming and they could rely on us for product.</p><p> 这不是一个特别结构化的过程，但我希望那些知道爸爸知道阿特拉斯仍然嗡嗡声，他们可以依靠我们的产品。</p><p> And for those that didn’t know us, the next time they had a need, they knew they could reach out to us.</p><p> 对于那些不认识我们的人，下次他们需要的时候，他们就知道他们可以伸向我们。 </p><p> This was a lot of cold emailing and cold calling. I have heightened respect for what SDRs do at CB Insights or anywhere. It is hard work. But also incredibly rewarding when someone closes based on your efforts.</p><p>这是很多冷电子邮件和冷呼叫。我已经提高了在CB见解或任何地方进行的SDR尊重。这是艰苦的工作。但是当有人根据您的努力关闭时，也令人难以置信的奖励。</p><p> At the same time, I also focused on price. Dad had built a high margin business which afforded me the opportunity to try to gain market share by being more aggressive with price.</p><p> 与此同时，我还专注于价格。爸爸建立了一项高利润率的业务，这为我提供了通过更具侵略性地获得市场份额的机会。</p><p> Coumarin is probably a 6,000 ton product per year. Atlas was about 10-12% of the global market, but we had capacity at the plant that wasn’t being used so I knew we could produce and sell more. There is some supply-demand curve, marginal cost calculation I could have done here, but I didn’t do any of that.</p><p> 香豆素每年可能是6,000吨的产品。阿特拉斯大约是全球市场的10-12％，但我们在没有被用的工厂的能力，所以我知道我们可以生产和销售更多。有一些供应需求曲线，我可以在这里完成的边际成本计算，但我没有这样做。</p><p> I did some back of the envelope math in my head and had worked out a simple, rudimentary cost per kg formula in Excel to ensure we were always making something on a sale, but I ran Atlas on instinct a lot more than analysis.</p><p> 我在我的头上做了一些信封数学的回报，并在Excel中制作了一个简单的，基本的成本在Excel中，以确保我们始终在销售上进行一些东西，但我在本能上跑了阿特拉斯，而不是分析。</p><p> Atlas has a great team with lots of experience. I assumed if I was doing something really really dumb, they’d tell me 🙂</p><p> 阿特拉斯拥有一个伟大的团队，拥有许多经验。我假设我是否正在做一些真的真的愚蠢，他们会告诉我♥</p><p> In the last financial year (April 2017-March 2018), Atlas had its best revenue in history. In November 2017, we dispatched 100 tons of Coumarin to customers for the first time in the company’s history.</p><p> 在最后一个财政年度（2018年4月至2018年3月）中，阿特拉斯在历史上获得了最佳收入。 2017年11月，我们在公司历史上第一次向客户发送100吨香豆素。</p><p> I remember taking   mithai  (sweets) to the site at the end of November when the 100 ton month happened and celebrating with the team. It was one of the proudest days I’ve ever had professionally. I was incredibly proud of the Atlas team who had seen a potentially company-sinking event happen with my dad’s death in April and who’d kept fighting and doing good work and then just had a historic month.</p><p> 我记得在11月底前往网站的网站，当时100吨月发生了100吨月，并与团队庆祝。这是我专业的最骄傲的日子之一。我非常自豪地为阿特拉斯队感到骄傲，他们在4月份在爸爸的死亡中看到了一个潜在的公司沉没的事件，谁一直在战斗，做好工作，然后刚刚有一个历史的月份。 </p><p>    As soon as I took over the business, the calls started coming from interested buyers or their investment banks.</p><p>一旦我接管了这项业务，那么呼吁就开始来自兴趣的买家或其投资银行。</p><p> Dad had already been in discussions with 1 firm prior to his death, and I’d met them once with him. They re-engaged.</p><p> 爸爸在他去世之前已经与1家公司进行了讨论，我会和他遇见过他们一次。他们重新订婚了。</p><p> The flavor &amp; fragrance industry in India is big, but small at the same time.</p><p> 风味＆amp;印度的香水产业大，但同时小。</p><p>  As a result, various buyers expressed interest. I reached out to a couple of our large customers to feel them out.</p><p>  结果，各种买家表示兴趣。我伸出了一些大客户来感受到他们。</p><p>  I had done some basic research on the space so I understood the players and sounded at least reasonably smart. A report by investment bank Avendus on the flavor &amp; fragrance industry was useful for a novice like me. Atlas was a base ingredient manufacturer. Our likely buyers were either larger base ingredient manufacturers or functional ingredient manufacturers who were interested in vertical integration.</p><p>  我对该空间做了一些基本研究，所以我理解球员并响起至少合理聪明。投资银行Avendus关于味道＆amp的报告;香水行业对像我这样的新手有用。阿特拉斯是一个基础成分制造商。我们可能的买家是较大的基础成分制造商或功能性成分制造商，他们对垂直整合感兴趣。</p><p>  There were 5 buyers that either came to us or that I’d identified and gotten some expression of interest from.</p><p>  有5个买家，要么来找我们，要么我发现并得到了一些感兴趣的表达。</p><p> Buyer 1 – A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes</p><p> 买方1  - 一个公开交易的印度公司，也使香豆素更小的卷 </p><p>  Buyer 3 – A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US</p><p>买家3  - 一个富裕的家庭，希望为他们的儿子从美国返回的儿子购买业务</p><p>   Before digging into how things went with each buyer, it is worth understanding that there were certain criteria I had for a deal which made eliminating certain buyers easy.</p><p>   在挖掘每个买家的事情挖掘出现的事情之前，值得理解的是，我有一定的标准，这是一笔交易，使得消除某些买家容易。</p><p>  They had to take care of the team  — I wanted to find a growth-oriented company as ensuring the team that had helped build Atlas would be taken care of was critical.  The biggest factor in any decision was this as I viewed it as intertwined with my dad’s legacy. He spent 30 years building this company with this team. It was important that this be maintained and hopefully taken to the next level. There is, of course, no way to know this for sure and this is where one’s gut and how the buyer across the table makes you feel is important.</p><p>  他们不得不照顾团队 - 我想找到一个成长为导向的公司，确保了帮助建立地图集的团队将得到关注至关重要。任何决定中最大的因素就是这样，因为我认为它与我父亲的遗产交织如此。他花了30年与这家团队建造这家公司。重要的是，这是维持并希望采取下一级别。当然，没有办法肯定知道这一点，这是一个人的肠道以及买方在桌子上的方式让你感觉很重要。</p><p> Simple deal  — I was not interested in stock in a private company or an illiquid public company or a long earn-out or some other complex structure. Atlas wouldn’t be a big deal for any credible buyer. Complexity wasn’t required. I also didn’t have time to educate a buyer on the space.</p><p> 简单的交易 - 我对私营公司的库存或没有公共公司的库存或长期或其他一些复杂的结构。阿特拉斯对任何可靠的买家来说不会是一个大的交易。复杂不需要。我也没有时间教育买方的空间。</p><p> A fair price  — When the founder/face of a company dies (my dad), a bunch of bottom feeding parasites can show up. I wasn’t expecting to get a top of the market price for Atlas, but I wanted a fair one. Moreover, the longer I ran Atlas, the more confident I became in my ability to run it. So the price was only going to go up with time.</p><p> 一个公平的价格 - 当公司的创始人/面对（我的父亲）时，一堆底部喂养寄生虫可以出现。我并没有期望获得地图集的市场价格，但我想要一个公平的地图。此外，我跑了越来越多的地图集，我更有信心的力量在我运行它的能力中。所以价格只是随着时间的推移。</p><p>  Buyer 1 — A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes</p><p>  买方1  - 一个公开交易的印度公司，也使香豆素更小的卷</p><p> I met with one of the execs of this firm along with their investment bank once.</p><p> 我与投资银行一起遇到了这家公司的一个官方。 </p><p> I shared high-level data on Atlas with them but the conversation ended after that. They were saddled with lots of debt as I could see given they were public and so didn’t think a deal with them would meet the criteria I had on fair price, simplicity, or even ability to take care of the team.</p><p>我在与他们共享了高级别数据，但在此之后谈话结束。由于我可以看到他们是公开的，他们掩盖了很多债务，所以没有想到他们的交易会符合我对公平价格，简单甚至能够照顾团队的标准。</p><p>     They were interested in Atlas. We talked a bit and they proposed a deal, but the structure was complicated and so I let this one go. They are a long-standing client and we were far enough away from any deal that it didn’t make sense to engage further.</p><p>     他们对阿特拉斯感兴趣。我们谈了一下，他们提出了一笔交易，但结构很复杂，所以我让这个一个人走了。他们是一个长期的客户，我们远离任何交易都足以进一步参与。</p><p> Buyer 3 — A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US</p><p> 买家3  - 一个富裕的家庭，希望为他们的儿子从美国返回的儿子购买业务</p><p>  They were a family with a large industrial business and were interested in expanding into new lines as their son was returning to India from the US. (I guess really wealthy people do things like this).</p><p>  他们是一个具有大型工业业务的家庭，并且有兴趣扩展到新的线条，因为他们的儿子从美国回到印度。 （我想真的很富有的人这样做的事情）。</p><p>  The challenge here was that it’d require lots of education about the industry and the probability of success even after investing would be low.</p><p>  这里的挑战是，即使在投资之后也需要大量的行业教育以及成功的可能性。</p><p>    This was the firm my dad was already in discussions with. The firm had seen Atlas’ numbers and had actually given an offer to my dad prior to his death. They seemed the most promising at the outset given the diligence they’d already done.</p><p>    这是我父亲已经讨论的公司。该公司已经看到了阿特拉斯的号码，并且在他去世之前曾在爸爸上给出了报价。当他们已经完成的勤奋时，他们似乎最有希望。</p><p>   For an hour, they told me all the reasons Atlas wasn’t a great business. I listened as I’m probably too deferential to those older than me than I should be.</p><p>   一小时，他们告诉我阿特拉斯不是一个很棒的事。我听了，因为我可能太恭敬于比我比我更老了。 </p><p> And after listening for a while, I asked them, “You’ve told me all the reasons Atlas is such a bad company. So why do you want to acquire it?”</p><p>在听一段时间后，我问了他们，​​“你告诉我阿特拉斯的所有原因是这么糟糕的公司。那么你为什么要获得它？“</p><p>   Part of this may have been culture fit and part of this was likely ownership by PE which complicated decision-making on their side. It’s important to understand the decision-making criteria and process of a buyer when discussing M&amp;A.</p><p>   其中一部分可能一直是文化适应，部分是PE在其身边复杂的决策中可能拥有的可能性。在讨论M＆amp时，了解买方的决策标准和过程非常重要; a。</p><p>  I told them that process didn’t work for Atlas or me or my family. And I told them that process was what we needed to run. When they said no, I wished them luck and moved on.</p><p>  我告诉他们这个过程不适用于阿特拉斯或我或我的家人。我告诉他们这个过程是我们需要运行的东西。当他们说不时，我祝你运气并继续前进。</p><p> I was nervous doing this tbh. There wasn’t a huge list of buyers for Atlas and shutting one of them out seemed at times like it might be foolish. But you have to go with your gut on these things.</p><p> 我很紧张地做这个tbh。没有一个巨大的买家名单，阿特拉斯并将其中一个人关闭似乎可能是愚蠢的。但你必须和你的肠道一起去这些东西。</p><p>    I’d received lots of calls from bankers prior and I insisted they tell me who they were representing as many were just fishing.</p><p>    我先前收到了来自银行家的许多电话，我坚持认为他们告诉我他们代表的是谁只是钓鱼。</p><p>    I explained my criteria, they explained their vision, they put a non-binding offer together that was clean/clear and we got moving on diligence.</p><p>    我解释了我的标准，他们解释了他们的愿景，他们把一个不合格的报价放在一起清洁/清澈，我们得到了努力。</p><p>   On May 31st, I flew back to India.  It was my 8th trip in the last 13 months.</p><p>   5月31日，我飞回印度。这是我过去13个月的第8次旅行。 </p><p> I landed at 10pm. The offices of Avendus, the investment bank representing Eternis, the buyer, was the first destination.</p><p>我降落在晚上10点。 Avendus的办公室，代表ETERNIS，买方的投资银行是第一个目的地。</p><p> I arrived at 11pm and we worked until 5am to hash out final details of the deal.</p><p> 我达到11点，我们才致力于凌晨5点到哈希出现的最终交易细节。</p><p> We went away for 4.5 hours to shower and get some sleep and resumed at Eternis’ office at 930am on June 1st. By 4pm that day, the deal was done.</p><p> 我们离开了4.5小时淋浴，睡个好觉，并于6月1日在埃特内斯的办公室恢复。那天下午4点，这笔交易已经完成。</p><p>  The news broke within the industry pretty quickly. During the 4-hour drive to Nasik, folks started calling and WhatsApp messaging me — customers, vendors, etc.</p><p>  这个消息很快就破裂了行业。在4小时的车程到NASIK，人们开始致电和WhatsApp Messing Me  - 客户，供应商等。</p><p>   I was hoping to tell the team on Saturday (6 day workweek at Atlas) in the office so I felt bad that some of them heard about the deal on Friday evening through others.</p><p>   我希望在办公室周六（阿特拉斯在地图集6天的工作周期）告诉这支球队，所以我感到难过，其中一些人在周五晚上通过其他人听到这笔交易。</p><p> The next day, I went to the factory and members of the Eternis team came. Manu of the Eternis team addressed the office and factory staff and gave a great view into their goals and their company.</p><p> 第二天，我去了工厂，Eternis团队的成员来了。 ETERNIS团队的Manu解决办公室和工厂员工，并欣赏到他们的目标和公司的壮丽景色。</p><p>   On June 4th, we decided that our family would officially say farewell to the entire Atlas team at the factory. We had everyone from the office come up.</p><p>   6月4日，我们决定，我们的家人会在工厂正式告别整个地图集团队。我们从办公室里的每个人都上了起来。 </p><p> My mom, kids, and wife flew in from the States. I wanted my kids to see what their “Dada” (grandfather) had built at least 1 time before it moved onto the next chapter in its story.</p><p>我的妈妈，孩子和妻子从各州飞行。我希望我的孩子看看他们的“祖父”（祖父）在其故事中的下一章进入下一章之前建造了至少1次。</p><p>   I had prepared a speech in English and my wife translated it to Hindi. My Hindi is not very good so beyond the emotion of this farewell, I was pretty scared of delivering a several minute speech in Hindi. I’d never done something like that.</p><p>   我准备了英语演讲，我的妻子将它翻译成印度。我的印度教不太好，如此告别的情绪，我非常害怕在印地语中提供几次讲话。我从来没有这样做。</p><p> We assembled in the warehouse, and I stood on top of the chemical mixer and talked to the team. I fought back tears several times during my speech. My Hindi was intelligible enough that I had several others on the Atlas team also crying so I guess that my message was understood.</p><p> 我们组装在仓库里，我站在化学混合器的顶部并与团队谈话。在发言中，我几次撕裂了泪水。我的印度是足够懂的，我在阿特拉斯队上有几个其他人也哭了，所以我想我的信息被理解了。</p><p>  My speech in English is below.  It was delivered in Hindi, and the video is something I hope to show my kids when they are old enough to understand.</p><p>  我用英语发言如下。它是在印地语中交付的，视频是我希望在足够老的时候向孩子们展示我的孩子。</p><p>  My Hindi is not very good so please forgive me if I make any mistakes.</p><p>  我的印度不是很好，所以如果我犯了任何错误，请原谅我。</p><p> Dad started Atlas 29 years ago. As my sisters and I were growing up, we joked that Atlas was his 4th child.</p><p> 爸爸29年前开始阿特拉斯。作为我的姐妹和我在成长，我们开玩笑说，阿特拉斯是他的第四个孩子。</p><p> But in reality, Atlas was less of a 4th child </p><p> 但实际上，阿特拉斯少了一个第四个孩子 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/team-blog/run-sell-company/">https://www.cbinsights.com/research/team-blog/run-sell-company/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/国家/">#国家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sell/">#sell</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
