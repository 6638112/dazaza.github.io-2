At the moment, it is back to where it started 2021, which was in the $29,000 range.\n We bring this up not to remind you that markets go up and markets go down. We bring it up because it rather perfectly shows the degree to which bitcoin is a completely speculative and momentum-driven asset.\n Bitcoin carried over a ton of momentum from 2020 into the first quarter of this year. At the crest of that wave was the public listing of Coinbase Global Inc. on April 14. The cryptoanarchists were at the proverbial gate, and it looked like one big buying opportunity. The same day, bitcoin hit a fresh record near $65,000.\n In retrospect, though, that was the turning point. \u201cThis is going to be a roller coaster,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives  told us that day. It was an understatement.\n The momentum peaked that very day, and it\u2019s been all downhill from there. Bitcoin is now down more than 50% from its record high, and everybody in cryptoland is trying to convince each other that this is the bottom.\n But without fundamentals for investors to latch onto, it is impossible to determine what a fair value is for bitcoin. So its bottom will likely be marked by the same thing its top was: exhaustion.

", "note_en": "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson will appear at a committee meeting of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee on Wednesday, and the meeting could be full of intrigue when the subject of NASA&#39;s Artemis Program to land humans on the Moon and SpaceX comes up.\n We can probably expect some happy talk as Nelson\u2014who as a US Senator in 2011 championed development of the Space Launch System rocket alongside Kay Bailey Hutchison\u2014references the recent stacking of the booster&#39;s core stage with its solid rocket motors at Kennedy Space Center. After a decade and more than $20 billion in costs, NASA&#39;s large SLS rocket is indeed finally getting closer to its first test launch.\n But the real intrigue will involve the Human Landing System needed as part of the Moon program to take astronauts down to the lunar surface and back up to orbit. In April, due in part to a lack of funding from Congress,  NASA selected SpaceX and its Starship vehicle as a sole provider for this critical component of Artemis. The space agency awarded $2.89 billion to SpaceX for the lander.\n  Nelson was formally named NASA administrator shortly after this award was made. He has supported the contract, because he knows it is the only real chance that NASA has to make a 2024 landing. But he has repeatedly asked Congress for more funding so that NASA can support a second lander contract, either  via the Biden administration&#39;s jobs and infrastructure bill\u00a0or as a straightforward budget addition.\n    That latter suggestion is the route recently taken by the Senate, which authorized the addition of $10 billion to NASA&#39;s budget as part of the Endless Frontier Act passed this month. The money would principally fund development of a second lander, likely the one being designed by a Blue Origin-led team, as well as some parochial NASA projects that can  justifiably be described as pork.\n What makes Wednesday&#39;s hearing before the House intriguing is that key US Representatives have signaled they will not follow the Senate&#39;s lead. As part of its version of the Endless Frontier Act, the House Science Committee skipped authorizing funds for a second lunar lander. A US Representative from Seattle, near where Jeff Bezos&#39; Amazon and Blue Origin companies are based, offered a stinging rebuke,  telling The Wall Street Journal, &#34;If Jeff Bezos wants to explore space, that\u2019s great, but I don\u2019t think he needs federal dollars.&#34;\n So it seems clear that the House will not just throw more money at NASA for a second lunar lander. At the same time, the House is fairly hostile toward SpaceX and commercial space. The chair of the House Science Committee, Dallas Democrat Eddie Bernice Johnson,  said she was &#34;disappointed&#34; after NASA selected SpaceX as its sole provider of a lunar lander in April.\n  Johnson&#39;s opposition was not a huge surprise. Last year, she and then-US Representative Kendra Horn issued  a joint statement expressing concerns about NASA&#39;s plans to rely on a &#34;commercial&#34; provider for a lunar lander. NASA wanted to issue a fixed-price contract for the lander instead of a cost-plus contract. NASA explained that it had used fixed-price contracting as part of its Commercial Crew program, and it proved a cheaper and faster method. The agency seemed justified in this, as SpaceX Crew Dragons now safely ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station.\n    However, many in Congress have opposed this approach. They cite a desire for NASA to have more &#34;oversight&#34; over these contracts as a rationale for favoring cost-plus contracts. Yet, an often unstated rationale likely has more sway over Congress. Under a cost-plus contract, Congress retains some control over who gets space jobs and in which states. Under fixed-price contracts, these decisions are left up to the contractors themselves.\n Here is Johnson, in 2020, expressing her concerns about funding the lunar lander with a fixed price contract:\u00a0&#34;The multi-year delays and difficulties experienced by the companies of NASA\u2019s taxpayer-funded Commercial Crew program\u2014a program with the far less ambitious goal of just getting NASA astronauts back to low Earth orbit\u2014make clear to me that we should not be trying to privatize America\u2019s Moon-Mars program, especially when at the end of the day American taxpayers\u2014not the private companies\u2014are going to wind up paying the lion\u2019s share of the costs,&#34; she said.\n  Given this backdrop, Wednesday&#39;s hearing, called to discuss NASA&#39;s budget request for fiscal year 2022, will be worth watching. Nelson&#39;s goal will be to secure some funding for Artemis, as he would like to have some competition to spur the program forward.\n Johnson, meanwhile, is likely to be unhappy. After Congress appropriated so little funding for a lander in last year&#39;s budget, NASA said, &#39;fine, we&#39;ll take the lowest cost option,&#39; which was SpaceX. To make things worse, from her perspective, NASA ignored her preferred solution for going to the Moon, which was to bypass the commercial lander approach entirely. She supports the SLS rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and big government space programs that supply a lot of jobs. She made this clear during a hearing in 2016, when the prospect of using lower-cost commercial vehicles for space exploration came up.\n \u201cTo all those NASA and contract employees I would simply say, Congress supports SLS and Orion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will continue to do so no matter what.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:06:44", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40,nasa,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u519c\u5386,administrator", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u6301\u6000\u7591\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u4f1a\u4e4b\u524d\u634d\u536b\u519c\u5386\u9884\u7b97 ", "title_en": "NASA administrator to defend lunar budget before a skeptical Congress", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/nasa-administrator-to-defend-lunar-budget-before-a-skeptical-congress/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40", "nasa", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u519c\u5386"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6e24164fe4d5b5e2cc18ec8b2e9f7b53.jpg", "infoid": 1067440, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6295\u5165\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u65b0\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u7403\u5458\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053Duolingo\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u94a2\u94c1\u57ce\u5e02\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u78e8\u6389\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002  \u8d85\u8fc775\u5bb6\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u63d0\u4ea4\u6210\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u805a\u5149\u706f\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u5230\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5230\u53e3\u9999\u7cd6\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002 \u662f\u7684\uff0c\u56bc\u53e3\u9999\u7cd6\u3002 \u662f\u7684\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f88\u68d2\u3002  \u5728\u5339\u5179\u5821\u6709\u4e00\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8HQ'd\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u5411\u4e16\u754c\u5c55\u793a\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff1f \u63d0\u4ea4\u60a8\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u3002  \u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u6709\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7403\u5458\u662f\u8c01\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5b83\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0cML\u548cAI\u7684\u70ed\u95e8\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff1f \u6ce8\u518c\u53c2\u52a0\u5e76\u4e8e6\u670829\u65e5\u5728et et et:::::::::::::::::::::10 \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u542c\u5230Carnegie Mellon Universition\uff0cMayor Bill Peduto\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5ba2\u4ebaFarningo\u3002 ", "note_en": "The pitch-off is also a great way to get to know players in locations that are new to us.

Submit your company  and you might be chosen.\n Interested in what\u2019s happening in the city, who the major players are and why it\u2019s a hot destination for robotics, ML and AI?   Register to attend  and join us on June 29th at 1:30pm ET. You\u2019ll hear from   Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo ,   Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian ,   Mayor Bill Peduto  and a few other fun guests.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "Sitting at multiple seats at the table showed Singh the \u201cunfortunate reality of what it takes to run a restaurant. Weeks into buying that meat pie shop, Singh watched tens of thousands of dollars burn due to failing equipment and contractor issues.\n \u201cI realized [that] I have so much support at the front of the house to drive revenue to the door, but I have no technology to support the back of the house,\u201d he said. Singh soon realized that his pain point was shared by many other restaurant owners, which seeded the idea for ResQ, a startup all about optimizing the back of the house, or non-customer facing, operation for restaurants.\n  ResQ announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by Homebrew, Golden Ventures, and Inovia Capital. Participating angel investors include Nilam Ganenthiran, president at Instacart; Gokul Rajaram, Doordash executive and board member of Pinterest and Coinbase, as well as customers, including Soul Foods, a global franchisee of Yum! Brands. ResQ has now raised $9 million in known venture capital to date.\n The capital will primarily help ResQ double or triple its 60-person team across engineering, sales, and operation roles. The company will also earmark money toward launching in new markets, building atop its current presence in San Francisco, LA, Dallas, Chicago, and Phoenix.\n  ResQ\u2019s business is split into two parts: a software platform and contractor marketplace.\n The platform allows restaurants to request, manage, and pay for a service that they need done, from plumbing issues to electrical mishaps. ResQ claims it can save restaurants between 10-30% in annual repairs by offering competitive rates, and faster communication and hiring loops. It charges a monthly SaaS fee per rooftop to a restaurant group.\n  The software layer sits on top of ResQ\u2019s contractor marketplace, which is essentially a supply of geographic-specific workers with a variety of specialties that can come to do repairs or management. In exchange for providing contractors with work, ResQ takes a portion of revenue they make from each service. Singh sees the marketplace business of ResQ as a differentiator from incumbents or startup competitors such as ServiceChannel.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t just need a fancy-looking piece of software,\u201d Singh said. \u201cYou need a product that can manage vendors, that can make sure they show up on time, that can make sure that they\u2019re not overcharging, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re a SaaS enabled marketplace in the background.\u201d By owning the supply side of the repair market, ResQ can have more precision when meeting demand and understanding its end customer.\n Of course, a challenge with any marketplace is balancing and sourcing a high-quality supply. ResQ has over 700 contractors on its platform right now, but it needs to continue building them up in order to meet needs and get restaurant services on time. Singh said that a majority of its contractor supply comes from its restaurant customers bringing on preferred partners to their platform. ResQ then backfills, he said, any gaps in supply or if there are any specialties that are missing. While that process may be convenient for now, the startup could eventually scale \u2013 and sweeten the deal \u2013 by generating its own supply of contractors.\n Hunter Walk, partner at  Homebrew, thinks that ResQ could eventually use its positioning as a marketplace to bring on edtech and fintech services to contractors. For example, it has plans to eventually turn into a skills provider to train and place local talent. ResQ also wants to turn into a \u201cbusiness in a box\u201d for these contractors, helping them grow their business through payment and billing support.\n \u201cFor me that\u2019s the difference between \u2018you\u2019re just making things more efficient\u2019 versus \u2018you\u2019re also giving some percentage of your worker base the chance to think in new ways about the services they provide,\u201d Walk said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just thinking about it as an as a optimization algorithm, then you\u2019re never really going to get into the \u2018what can I do to help make these people\u2019s lives better\u2019 and those are where some of the upside of the economics live as well.\u201d He noted that Singh\u2019s experience, and ethos as a founder, will lead to ResQ solving problems more holistically and humanly.\n   Even with successful operations, margins can be razor-thin in the restaurant industry. This reality puts any startup in the restaurant tech industry at risk: when costs need to be cut, SaaS tools could be the first to go. Toast, for example, initially  cut 50% of its staff due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\n  \u201cWe started building a new paradigm to our product and transitioned from a transactional marketplace mobile only focused on smaller restaurants, to a fully SaaS product focused on multi-unit operators powered by a local marketplace,\u201d Singh said. Surely enough, the company\u2019s revenue grew 750% over the past year.\n To date, ResQ has worked with over 3,000 restaurant groups including KFC, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons.

Timely has racked up 500,000 users since 2014, including more than 5,000 paying businesses in 160 countries.\n Now, Memory.ai has raised $14 million as it gears up to launch its next apps,  Dewo (pronounced \u201cDe-Voh\u201d), an app that is meant to help people do more \u201cdeep work\u201d by learning about what they are working on and filtering out distractions to focus better; and  Glue, described as a knowledge hub to help in the creative process. Both are due to be released later in the year.\n  The funding is being led by local investors Melesio and Sanden, with participation from Investinor, Concentric and SN\u00d6 Ventures, who  backed Memory.ai previously.\n \u201cProductivity apps\u201d has always been something of a nebulous category in the world of connected work. They can variously cover any kind of collaboration management software ranging from Asana and Jira through to Slack and Notion; or software that makes doing an existing work task more efficiently than you did it before (eg Microsoft has described all of what goes into Microsoft 365 \u2014 Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc. \u2014 as \u201cproductivity apps\u201d); or, yes, apps like those from Memory.ai that aim to improve your concentration or time management.\n These days, however, it feels like the worlds of AI and advances in mobile computing are increasingly coming together to evolve that concept once again.\n If the first wave of smartphone communications and the apps that are run on smartphone devices \u2014 social, gaming, productivity, media, information, etc. \u2014 have led to us getting pinged by a huge amount of data from lots of different places, all of the time, then could it be that the second wave is quite possibly going to usher in a newer wave of tools to handle all that better, built on the premise that not everything is of equal importance? No-mo FOMO? We\u2019ll see.\n In any case, some bigger platform players also helping to push the agenda of what productivity means in this day and age.\n For example, in Apple\u2019s recent preview of iOS 15 (due to come out later this year) the company gave a supercharge to its existing \u201cdo not disturb\u201d feature on its phones, where it  showed off a new Focus mode, letting users customize how and when they want to receive notifications from which apps, and even which apps they want to have displayed, all organized by different times of day (eg work time), place, calendar items, and so on.\n \u201c Today,  iPhone  plays  so  many  roles  in  our  lives.  It\u2019s  where  we  get  information,  how  people  reach  us,  and  where  we  get  things  done.  This  is  great,  but  it  means  our  attention  is  being  pulled  in  so  many  different  directions  and  finding  that  balance  between  work  and  life  can  be  tricky,\u201d said Apple\u2019s Craig Federighi in the WWDC keynote earlier this month. \u201c We  want  to  free  up  space  to  focus  and  help  you  be  in  the  moment.\u201d How well that gets used, and how much other platforms like Google follow suit, will be interesting to see play out. It feels, in any case, like it could be the start of something.\n And, serendipitously \u2014 or maybe because this is some kind of zeitgeist \u2014 this is also playing \u00a0into what Memory.ai has built and is building.\n Mathias Mikkelsen, the Oslo-based founder of Memory.ai, first came up for his idea for Timely (which had also been the original name of the whole startup) when he was working as a designer in the ad industry, one of those jobs that needed to track what he was working on, and for how long, in order to get paid.\n He said he knew the whole system as it existed was inefficient: \u201cI just thought it was insane how cumbersome and old it was. But at the same time how important it was for the task,\u201d he said.\n The guy had an entrepreneurial itch that he was keen to scratch, and this idea would become the salve to help him. Mikkelsen was so taken with building a startup around time management, that he sold his apartment in Oslo and moved himself to San Francisco to be where he believed was the epicenter of startup innovation. He tells me he lived off the proceeds of his flat for two years \u201cin a closet\u201d in a hacker house, bootstrapping Timely, until eventually getting into an accelerator (500 Startups) and subsequently starting to raise money. He eventually moved back to Oslo after two years to continue growing the business, as well as to live somewhere a little more spacious.\n The startup\u2019s big technical breakthrough with Timely was to figure out an efficient way of tracking time for different tasks, not just time worked on anything, without people having to go through a lot of data entry.\n The solution: to integrate with a person\u2019s computer, plus a basic to-do schedule for a day or week, and then match up which files are open when to determine how long one works for one client or another. Phone or messaging conversations, for the moment, are not included, and neither are the contents of documents \u2014 just the titles of them. Nor is data coming from wearable devices, although you could see how that, too, might prove useful.\n The basic premise is to be personalised, so managers and others cannot use Timely to track exactly what people are doing, although they can track and bill for those billable hours. All this is important, as it also will feed into how DeWo and Glue will work.\n The startup\u2019s big conceptual breakthrough came around the same time: Getting time tracking or any productivity right \u201chas never been a UI problem,\u201d Mikkelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a human nature problem.\u201d This is where the AI comes in, to nudge people towards something they identify as important, and nudge them away from work that might not contribute to that. Tackling bigger issues beyond time are essential to improving productivity overall, which is why Memory.ai now wants to extend to apps for carving out time for deep thinking and creative thinking.\n While it might seem to be a threat that a company like Apple has identified the same time management predicament that Memory.ai has, and is looking to solve that itself, Mikkelsen is not fazed. He said he thinks of Focus as not unlike Apple\u2019s work on Health: there will be ways of feeding information into Apple\u2019s tool to make it work better for the user, and so that will be Memory.ai\u2019s opportunity to hopefully grow, not cannibalize, its own audience with Timely and its two new apps. It is, in a sense, a timely disruption.\n \u201cMemory\u2019s proven software is already redefining how businesses around the world track, plan and manage their time. We look forward to working with the team to help new markets profit from the efficiencies, insights and transparency of a Memory-enabled workforce,\u201d said Arild Engh, a partner at Melesio, in a statement.\n Kjartan Rist,\u00a0 a partner at Concentric, added: \u201cWe continue to be impressed with Memory\u2019s vision to build and launch best-in-class products for the global marketplace.
