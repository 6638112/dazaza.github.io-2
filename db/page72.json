There are few breaking changes in special scenarios which are described in  Breaking changes section below.\n     You can also store Hasura metadata in a separate (Postgres) database given by the environment variable  HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL\n  The server has been generalized to support different databases. We start off by providing read-only support for MS SQL server and BigQuery.\n      Support for creating idiomatic REST API endpoints from GraphQL query templates so that users can support non-GraphQL clients easily and integrate with their existing REST tooling.\n   The permission system has been extended for Remote Schemas. You can do type/field masking and preset arguments (with session variables) over remote schemas.\n      You can now create an  Inherited Role which allows you to combine multiple roles into one role (in an additive way). This solves fundamental problems with permission system (as described in  #877 and  #3442) and also helps you manage roles in a modular way.\n  In the first version, only Postgres queries and subscriptions are exposed for an inherited role.\n PS: Inherited roles is currently an experimental feature. To enable inherited roles, start the Hasura server with environment variable  HASURA_GRAPHQL_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES: &#34;inherited_roles&#34;\n   Consider two tables,  items(id, name, stock) and  shopping_cart(id, item_id, quantity) and these two tables are related via the  item_id column. Now, while defining insert permission on the  shopping_cart table, there can be a check to insert an item into the shopping cart only when there is enough  stock present in the  items table.\n   Comparison operators on columns with  ltree,  lquery or  ltxtquery types are now supported, for searching through data stored in a hierarchical tree-like structure.\n   Comparison operators on spatial data types, geometry and geography, are now supported in MS SQL Server. The following operators are supported:\n   We now support the use of the functions  ST_3DDWithin and  ST_3DIntersects in boolean expressions. Note that  ST_3DIntersects requires PostGIS be  built with SFCGAL support which may depend on the PostGIS distribution used.\n  server: add request field to webhook POST body containing the GraphQL query/mutation, its name, and any variables passed (close  #2666)\n  server: some mutations that cannot be performed will no longer be in the schema (for instance, delete_by_pk mutations won&#39;t be shown to users that do not have select permissions on all primary keys) ( #4111)\n   server: Configurable websocket keep-alive interval. Add --websocket-keepalive command-line flag and HASURA_GRAPHQL_WEBSOCKET_KEEPALIVE env variable (fix  #3539)\n server: introduce optional custom table name in table configuration to track the table according to the custom name. The set_table_custom_fields API has been deprecated, A new API set_table_customization has been added to set the configuration. ( #3811)\n server: support joining Int or String scalar types to ID scalar type in remote relationship\n   server: various changes to ensure timely cleanup of background threads and other resources in the event of a SIGTERM signal.\n server: fix issue with event triggers defined on a table which is partitioned (fixes  #6261)\n server: action array relationships now support the same input arguments (such as where or distinct_on) as usual relationships\n  server: fix issue with non-optional fields of the remote schema being added as optional in the graphql-engine (fix  #6401)\n server: accept new config allowed_skew in JWT config to provide leeway for JWT expiry (fixes  #2109)\n server: always log the request_id at the detail.request_id path for both query-log and http-log ( #6244)\n  server: terminate a request if time to acquire connection from pool exceeds configurable timeout ( #6326)\n      server: fix issue when a remote relationship&#39;s joining field had a custom GraphQL name defined (fix  #6626)\n    server: remove the restriction of supporting only base type function arguments. The type of an argument with a table type is now  &lt;tablename&gt;_scalar to avoid conflicts with the object type  &lt;tablename&gt;.\n server: add  --async-actions-fetch-interval command-line flag and  HASURA_GRAPHQL_ASYNC_ACTIONS_FETCH_INTERVAL environment variable for configuring async actions re-fetch interval from metadata storage (fix  #6460)\n    server: update pg_dump clean output to disable function body validation in create function statements to avoid errors due to forward references\n    server: add &#34;kind&#34; field to query-log items. Kind can be &#34;database&#34;, &#34;action&#34;, &#34;remote-schema&#34;, &#34;graphql&#34;, &#34;cached&#34;, or &#34;subscription&#34;\n   server: accept a new env conf  HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_FETCH_BATCH_SIZE to configure the number of rows being fetched from the events log table in a single batch\n server: restore proper batching behavior in event trigger processing so that at most 2x batch events are checked out at a time\n    server: initialise  hdb_catalog tables only when required, and only run the event loop for sources where it is required\n         server: fix bigint overflow, incorrect geojson format in event trigger payload (fix  #3697) (fix  #2368)\n  server: forward the x-request-id header when generated by graphql-engine (instead of being user-provided) (fix  #6654)\n server: introduce  --graceful-shutdown-timeout server config which will wait for the in-flight scheduled and event trigger events and async actions to complete before shutting down\n server: sanitise event trigger and scheduled trigger logs to omit possibly sensitive request body and headers\n   server: fix a bug in query validation that would cause some queries using default variable values to be rejected (fix  #6867)\n       server: remote relationships (database to remote schema joins) are now supported on SQL Server and BigQuery (console pending)\n server: BigQuery: switches to a single query generation from a dataloader approach.

When there are  null value(s), the remote schema won&#39;t be queried and the response of the remote relationship field will be  null. Earlier, the remote schema was queried with the  null value arguments and the response depended upon how the remote schema handled the  null arguments but as per user feedback, this behaviour was clearly not expected.\n The  order_by operator accepts an array of objects as input to allow ordering by multiple fields in a given order, i.e.  [{field1: sortOrder}, {field2: sortOrder}] but it is also accepts a single object with multiple keys as an input, i.e.  {field1: sortOrder, field2: sortOrder}. In earlier versions, Hasura&#39;s query parsing logic used to maintain the order of keys in the input object and hence the appropriate  order by clauses with the fields in the right order were generated .\n As the  GraphQL spec mentions that input object keys are unordered, Hasura v2.0&#39;s new and stricter query parsing logic doesn&#39;t maintain the order of keys in the input object taking away the guarantee of the generated  order by clauses to have the fields in the given order.\n For example: The query  fetch_users(order_by: {age: desc, name: asc}) {id name age} which is intended to fetch users ordered by their age and then by their name is now not guaranteed to return results first ordered by age and then by their name as the  order_by input is passed as an object. To achieve the expected behaviour, the following query  fetch_users(order_by: [{age: desc}, {name: asc}]) {id name age} should be used which uses an array to define the order of fields to generate the appropriate  order by clause.\n The name of the computed field argument has changed from  &lt;function_name&gt;_args to  &lt;computed_field_name&gt;_&lt;table_name&gt;_args as the function name is internal detail for a computed field. This change also enables adding a root-level tracked function as a computed field which previously would have thrown input type conflict error.\n Hasura APIs generated by older Hasura versions cannot be added as Remote Schemas to Hasura v2\n With v2.0, some of the auto-generated schema types have been extended. For example,  String_comparison_exp has an additional  regex input object field. This means if you have a Hasura API with an older Hasura version added as a remote schema then it will have a type conflict. You should upgrade all Hasura remote schemas to avoid such type conflicts.\n While applying multiple migrations, in earlier Hasura CLI versions all migration files were run under one transaction block. i.e. if any migration threw an error, all the previously successfully executed migrations would be rolled back. With Hasura CLI v2.0, each migration file is run in its own transaction block but all the migrations are not executed under one. i.e. if any migration throws an error, applying further migrations will be stopped but the other successfully executed migrations up till that point will not be rolled back.\n In v2.0, the values of the following env vars are used to define the connection parameters of the  default database while updating an existing instance or while starting a fresh instance. During metadata initialization, their values are moved to the metadata of the  default database as defined  here.\n  Post the initial setup/update once the metadata is initialized, these env vars can be considered as deprecated. i.e. changing or setting values of these env vars will have no impact as the values in the Hasura metadata are now used to define the connection parameters.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 21:14:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "graphql,graphcell,\u670d\u52a1\u5668", "title": "HASURA GraphCell Engine 2.0 ", "title_en": "Hasura GraphQL Engine 2.0", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases/tag/v2.0.0", "via": "", "real_tags": ["graphql", "graphcell", "\u670d\u52a1\u5668"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067691, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u8bfb\u8005\u8ba2\u9605FT  \u9009\u62e9\u8d2d\u4e70\u5ba1\u5224\u8ba2\u9605$ 1\u6301\u7eed4\u5468\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u5ba1\u5224\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u6bcf\u6708\u6536\u8d3991\u7f8e\u5143  4\u5468\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95eeFT\uff06\uff0339;

Growth in this already astronomical segment is explosive, with over 1.4 trillion photos taken last year, according to InfoTrends. That&#39;s up from 1 trillion in 2017. Video is much the same, with YouTube  saying in recent years\u00a0that about 500 hours of video is uploaded to the platform  every minute.\n Finding a solution to organizing and safely storing these precious memories is more important than ever, and it&#39;s becoming an increasingly large problem to solve. Photos depict a special moment in time, a memory or event that can&#39;t be recreated. They are irreplaceable and largely only exist digitally. Because of this, there are few categories of data that suit a free and open self-hosted solution better.\n Purists will argue that your photos are yours and you should own them forever, no matter what, in full resolution. Pragmatists will argue that so long as the export tools are good enough, purity doesn&#39;t matter. For many day-to-day photo service users, though, that was all an academic thought experiment\u2014most people use Google Photos. The service  passed a billion users two years ago. (Exporting on Google Photos, by the way, means using  Google Takeout. I&#39;ve been waiting for my requested data for seven days as of this writing.)\n  But this month, the choice reopens for many Internet users.  As of June 1, 2021, any new photos and videos uploaded to Google Photos will begin to count against your Google storage quota. Space that previously felt never-ending is now finite for some accounts. Existing high-quality photos and videos are exempt from this change, but the move has a lot of people, me included, thinking about alternatives.\n    Specifically, I&#39;ve been thinking about self-hosted photo management alternatives\u2014particularly those with web apps.\n  Photo management is a juggernaut of a topic, and it means different things to different people. For example, a professional photographer&#39;s needs are poles apart from those of people taking selfies on their cell phones.\n Each app below has its pros and cons. At the time of writing, we think you&#39;re unlikely to find a magic &#34;one size fits all&#34; option. But stringing a few apps together might result in a coherent workflow that makes leaving Google Photos less painful.\n You can also look at ditching Google Photos as an opportunity. Trying out the following tools serves as a primer for the world of  self-hosted photo management and exposes you to the most exciting Google Photos alternatives. This space is developing rapidly, and we&#39;d advise making use of the demos most projects provide to evaluate the apps for yourself before proceeding.\n We&#39;ve deliberately ignored more desktop-focused apps like  Adobe Lightroom,  Darktable, and\u00a0 digiKam. Google Photos is a web app, after all, so the software being tested here follows that same paradigm.\n  There are countless examples of mainstream applications or services we rely on becoming obsolete or placing once-free features behind a paywall (you&#39;ve seen Ars&#39; ongoing &#34; Google Kills Product&#34; series, right?). So for many self-hosters, using something that is  open source is a fundamental requirement. In a show of self-hosting solidarity, we&#39;ll also focus primarily on open source software today.\n  Perhaps you&#39;ve made it to this point in a story inspired by the &#34;fall&#34; of Google Photos and simply thought to yourself, &#34;Good riddance.&#34; But there&#39;s a reason why Google Photos has become the de facto photo-management software for many since the service launched in 2015.\n    Google Photos does most things most people want from this type of software, and it does those things reasonably well and easily.\n Google Photos has searchable object and face recognition, album support, automatic backup from mobile devices, and simple photo sharing with granular permissions, among other features. The service supports photos, live photos, and videos all the same. And by allowing folks to search their growing libraries by date, place, object, or person, Google solved the problem of organization with a single stroke.\n Google&#39;s massive scale is what makes most of this possible. It&#39;s what allows the company to train its machine-learning algorithms to know the difference between a &#34;mountain&#34; and a &#34;tree&#34; so accurately or for those algorithms to learn which faces are in your photos. Google&#39;s scale also raises questions about privacy, however.  The company says that &#34;privacy is at the heart of everything we do,&#34; and it doesn&#39;t use data in personal products like Gmail, Drive, Calendar, or Photos for advertising purposes. One wonders what Google does use that data for, though. Plus, metadata is often more powerful than the data itself.\n &#34;Since so many of you rely on Google Photos... it&#39;s important that it is able to serve you over the long haul,&#34; Google Photos product lead David Lieb  wrote on Twitter last fall. I want to trust that Google Photos will be around in 50 years, but that feels like a risky bet given Google&#39;s track record for killing products.\n So yes, Google Photos is good. But can we trust our data to it? And will the service be around for as long as we need it to be? At what cost?

First Round Capital, Designer Fund, and Scribble Ventures also participated in the fundraise, which will be used to continue investing in product and also hiring: the company has 20 on its own books now and will aim to double that by the end of this year, on the heels of positive reception in the market.\n Since launching officially last year, Pequity has picked up over 100 customers, with an initial focus on fast-scaling companies in its own backyard, a mark of how D&amp;I have come into focus in the tech industry in particular. Those using Pequity to compare and figure out compensation include Instacart, Scale.ai and ClearCo, and the company said that in the last four months, the platform\u2019s been used to make more then 5,000 job offers.\n   Kaitlyn Knopp, the CEO who co-founded the company with Warren Lebovics (both pictured, right), came up for the idea for Pequity in much the same way that many innovations in the world of enterprise IT come to market: through her own first-hand experience.\n She spent a decade working in employment compensation in the Bay Area, with previous roles at Google, Instacart, and Cruise. In that time, she found the tools that many companies used were lacking and simply \u201cclunky\u201d when it came to compensation analysis.\n \u201cThe way the market has worked so far is that platforms had compensation as an element but not the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the end of the tagline, the final part of a \u2018CRM for candidates.\u2019 But you still have to fill in all the gaps, you have to set the architecture the right way. And with compensation, you have to bake in your own analytics, which implies that you have to have some expertise.\u201d\n Indeed, as with other aspects of enterprise software, she added that the very biggest tech companies sometimes worked on their own tools, but not only does that leave smaller or otherwise other-focused businesses out of having better calculation tools, but it also means that those tools are siloed and miss out on being shaped by a bigger picture of the world of work. \u201cWe wanted to take that process and own it.\u201d\n The Pequity product essentially works by plugging into all of the other tools that an HR professional might be using \u2014 HRIS, ATS, and payroll products \u2014 to manage salaries across the whole of the organization in order to analyse and compare how compensation could look for existing and prospective employees. It combines a company\u2019s own data and then compares it to data from the wider market, including typical industry ranges and market trends, to provide insights to HR teams.\n All of this means that HR teams are able to make more informed decisions, which is step number one in being more transparent and equitable, but is also something that Pequity is optimized to cover specifically in how it measures compensation across a team.\n And in line with that, there is another aspect of the compensation mindset that Knopp also wanted to address in a standalone product, and that is the idea of building a tool with a mission, one of providing a platform that can bring in data to make transparent and equitable decisions.\n \u201cA lot of the comp tools that I\u2019ve interacted with are reactive,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may have to do, say, a pay equity test, you do your promotion and merit cycles, and then you find all these issues that you have to solve. We\u2019re flagging those things proactively with our analytics, because we\u2019re plugging into those systems, which will give you those alerts before the decisions need to be made.\u201d\n As an added step in that direction, Knopp said that ultimately she believes the tool should be something that those outside of HR, such as managers and emploiyees themselves, should be able to access to better understand the logic of their own compensation and have more information going into any kind of negotiation.\n Ultimately, it will be interesting to see whether modernized products like Pequity, which are tackling old problems with a new approach and point of view, find traction in the wider market. If one purpose in HR is to address diversity and inclusion, and part of the problem has been that the tools are just not fit for that purpose, then it seems a no-brainer that we\u2019ll see more organizations trying out new things to see if they can help them in their own race to secure talent.\n \u201cCompensation reflects a company\u2019s values, affects its ability to hire talent, and is the biggest expense on its P&amp;L. And yet, most comp teams run on spreadsheets and emails,\u201d said Parker Barrile, Partner at Norwest, in a statement. \u201cPequity empowers comp teams to design and manage equitable compensation

Lower is also something that is kind of rare these days in the startup world: profitable. Silicon Valley-based Accel has a history of backing profitable, bootstrapped companies, having also led large Series A rounds for the likes of 1Password, Atlassian, Qualtrics, Webflow, Tenable and Galileo (which went on to be acquired by SoFi).\n In fact, Galileo founder Clay Wilkes introduced the VC firm to Dan Snyder, Lower\u2019s founder and CEO. The two companies have a few things in common besides being profitable: they were both bootstrapped for years before taking institutional capital and both have headquarters outside of Silicon Valley.\n  \u201cWe were immediately intrigued because Ohio-based Lower echoes both of these themes,\u201d said Accel partner John Locke, who led the firm\u2019s investment in Lower and is taking a seat on the company\u2019s board as part of the investment. \u201cLike Galileo, Lower will be one of the most successful bootstrapped fintech companies globally. The combination of a company built in a nontraditional region across the globe and a bootstrapped company reminds us of [other] companies we have partnered with for a large Series A.\u201d\n There were other unnamed participants in the round, but Accel provided the \u201cmajority\u201d of the investment, according to Lower.\n Snyder co-founded Lower in 2014 with the goal of making the homebuying process simpler for consumers. The company launched with Homeside, its retail brand that Snyder describes as \u201ca tech-leveraged retail mortgage bank\u201d that works with realtors and builders, among others. In 2018, the company launched the website for Lower, its direct-to-consumer digital lending brand with the mission of making its platform a one-stop shop where consumers can go online to save for a home, obtain or refinance a mortgage and get insurance through its marketplace. This year, it launched the Lower mobile app with a savings account.\n  Over the years, Lower has funded billions of dollars in loans and notched an impressive $300 million in revenue in 2020 after doubling revenue every year, according to Snyder.\n \u201cOur history is maybe a little atypical of fintech companies today,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a view going back to the start of the company that we wanted to run it profitably. That\u2019s been one of our pillars, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Also, we all grew up in the mortgage industry, so we saw firsthand the size of the market, but also how broken it was, so we wanted to change it.\u201d\n In launching the direct-to-consumer digital lending brand, the company was working to make the homebuying process more \u201c digital, transparent and easier for consumers to access,\u201d Snyder said.\n At the same time, the company didn\u2019t want to lose the human touch.\n \u201cWe tried to design the app flow in a way where you can get as far along as you can in the application but if you want, at any point in time, to talk or chat with someone, we\u2019re available,\u201d Snyder added.\n  Lower\u2019s typical customer is the millennial and now Gen Z who\u2019s aspiring to own their first home, according to Snyder.\n \u201cThey might be thinking, \u2018OK, I might be living in an apartment now, but in the next few years I\u2019m going to meet someone and/or have a child and I want to unlock the investment that is a home,\u2019 \u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll help them on that journey.\u201d\n Lower\u2019s recently launched new app offers a deposit account it\u2019s dubbed \u201cHomeFund.\u201d The interest-bearing FDIC-insured deposit account offers a 0.75% Annual Percentage Yield and is designed to help consumers save for a home with a \u201cdollar-for-dollar match in rewards\u201d up to the first $1,000 saved, Snyder said.\n Lower works with more than 35 major insurance carriers nationally, including Nationwide, Liberty Mutual and Allstate. It has more than 1,600 employees, about half of which are based in Lower\u2019s home state. That\u2019s up from about 650 employees in June of 2020.\n Looking ahead, the company plans to add more services and has an \u201caggressive roadmap\u201d for adding new features to its platform.\u00a0 Today, for example, Lower sells primarily to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And while it services the majority of its loans, like many large lenders, it uses a subservicer. That will change, however, in early 2022, when Lower intends to launch its own native servicing platform.\n And while the company intends to continue to run profitably, Snyder said he and his co-founders \u201cthink the time is now to gain share.\u201d\n \u201cWe want to become a global brand, raise money and gain market share,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to double down on product and build out our capabilities. We are the best-kept secret in fintech and plan to change that with smart branding, advertising and sponsorships.\u201d\n  And last but not least, Lower is eyeing the public markets as part of its longer-term roadmap.\n \u201cUltimately, we know we can build a great public company,\u201d Snyder told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re of the scale to be a public company right now, but we\u2019re going to keep our heads down and we\u2019re going to keep building for the next few years and then I think we can be in a spot to be a strong public business.\u201d\n Accel\u2019s Locke points out  that in the U.S., mortgage and home finance are among the largest financial service markets, and they have primarily been handled by large banks.\n \u201cFor most consumers, getting a mortgage through these banks continues to be an overly complex, slow-moving process,\u201d Locke told TechCrunch. \u201cWe believe by providing consumers a great mobile experience, Lower will gain share from incumbent banks, in the same way that companies like Monzo have in banking or Venmo in payments or Trade Republic and Robinhood in stock trading.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:37:08", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Today\u2019s announcement comes only a few weeks after PlanetScale launched its new hosted database platform, also dubbed PlanetScale. The company had previously offered a hosted version of Vitess, but with this new service, it is going a step further and offering what it calls a \u201cdeveloper-first database\u201d that abstracts away all of the infrastructures to ensure that developers won\u2019t have to think about cloud zones, cluster sizes and other details.\n Indeed, PlanetScale CEO and co-founder Jiten Vaidya was quite open about the limitations of this earlier product. \u201cWhat we had built last year was pretty much hosted Vitess, which was no different than how a lot of cloud providers today give you databases,\u201d he said. \u201cSo none of this ease of use, none of this elegance, none of these state-of-the-art experiences that the developers want and expect today, we had built into our product.\u201d\n  But a few months ago, the company brought on former GitHub VP of Engineering  Sam Lambert as its Chief Product Officer. Vaidya noted that Lambert brought a lot of developer empathy to PlanetScale and helped it launch this new product.\n \u201cPeople come to you because they\u2019re not database experts, but they have data, they have problems,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cAnd too many companies, especially in the database world, do not think about the daily lives of their users like we do. They don\u2019t think about the complete journey of what the user is actually trying to do, which is to provide value to their customers. They\u2019re just very impressed with themselves for storing and retrieving data. And it\u2019s like, yep, we\u2019ve been doing that. We\u2019ve been doing that since the 60s. Can we do something else now?\u201d\n The company\u2019s users today include the likes of Slack, Figma, GitHub and Square, so it\u2019s clearly delivering value to a lot of users. As Lambert noted, PlanetScale aims to offer them a product that is simple and easy to use. \u201cJust because it is simple and easy to use, and beautiful, honestly \u2014 like just beautiful, well-designed tooling \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inferior. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s missing anything. It means the others are missing the poetry and the additional elements of beauty that you can add to infrastructure products,\u201d he said.\n PlanetScale plans to use the new funding to scale its team globally and accelerate the adoption of its platform.

About half of the world\u2019s largest 10,000 websites now use Next.js . Given the open-source nature of the Next.js framework, not all of these users are obviously Vercel customers, but its current paying customers include the likes of Carhartt, Github, IBM, McDonald\u2019s and Uber.\n  \u201cFor us, it all starts with a front-end developer,\u201d Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch told me. \u201cOur goal is to create and empower those developers \u2014 and their teams \u2014 to create delightful, immersive web experiences for their customers.\u201d\n With Vercel, Rauch and his team took the Next.js framework and then built a serverless platform that specifically caters to this framework and allows developers to focus on building their front ends without having to worry about scaling and performance.\n Older solutions, Rauch argues, were built in isolation from the cloud platforms and serverless technologies, leaving it up to the developers to deploy and scale their solutions. And while some potential users may also be content with using a headless content management system, Rauch argues that increasingly, developers need to be able to build solutions that can go deeper than the off-the-shelf solutions that many businesses use today.\n Rauch also noted that developers really like Vercel\u2019s ability to generate a preview URL for a site\u2019s front end every time a developer edits the code. \u201cSo instead of just spending all your time in code review, we\u2019re shifting the equation to spending your time reviewing or experiencing your front end. That makes the experience a lot more collaborative,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now, designers, marketers, IT, CEOs [\u2026] can now come together in this collaboration of building a front end and say, \u2018that shade of blue is not the right shade of blue.&#39;\u201d\n \u201cVercel is leading a market transition through which we are seeing the majority of value-add in web and cloud application development being delivered at the front end, closest to the user, where true experiences are made and enjoyed,\u201d said Geoff Lewis, founder and managing partner at Bedrock. \u201cWe are extremely enthusiastic to work closely with Guillermo and the peerless team he has assembled to drive this revolution forward and are very pleased to have been able to co-lead this round.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:29:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u6e90,\u5f00\u53d1,react,\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458", "title": "Vercel\uff0c\u5b83\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90Next.js React Framework\uff0c\u7531Bedrock Capital\u8fbe\u52301.1\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u57f9\u517b\u4e86102\u7c73\u7cfb\u5217C LED ", "title_en": "Vercel, which develops the popular open-source Next.js React framework, raises $102M Series C led by Bedrock Capital at a $1.1B valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u6e90", "\u5f00\u53d1", "react", "\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9fe23b8ae301ebe4343cbc02d311047c.jpg", "infoid": 1067684, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0cApple\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u547c\u5401\u5141\u8bb8IOS\u548ciPadoS\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u4f7f\u79f0\u4e3a\u201cSideloading\u201d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b -

Allowing users to install apps on their iPhones and iPads without Apple serving as an intermediary would alleviate concerns about its  App Store rejections\u00a0and  fees, which have been part of an ongoing drama since the first authorized third-party iPhone apps debuted 13 years ago. Sideloading would also weaken arguments that Apple\u2019s control of the App Store amounts to  an illegal monopoly.\n But many security experts\u2014and fans of Apple\u2019s privacy features\u2014find such a proposal alarming. It\u2019s true that Android allows sideloading, but  sideloading is one of the main reasons that Google\u2019s mobile operating system is so riddled with malware. Bad actors know that if they want to attack an Android device, the easiest way to do so is to hide it in a sideloaded app disguised as, for example,  a popular anti-virus app or  even an Android system update. Once the app is installed on the Android device, it can then inject the malware payload,  such as ransomware.\n To help the public better understand Apple\u2019s stance on sideloading, the company  has released its newest privacy white paper, which focuses on the topic. In advance of the paper\u2019s release, I spoke to Apple\u2019s head of user privacy, Erik Neuenschwander, about the practice and why Apple\u2014judging from our conversation\u2014remains vehemently opposed to it.\n  As someone who frequently writes about privacy and security, I agree with Apple\u2019s position on the topic. Some who argue that Apple should allow sideloaded apps say that it would provide users with more choice. Yet choice is exactly what Neuenschwander says the company is offering users by providing a platform that does not allow sideloading.\n \u201cSideloading in this case is actually eliminating choice,\u201d he says. \u201cUsers who want that direct access to applications without any kind of review have sideloading today on other platforms. The iOS platform is the one where users understand that they can\u2019t be tricked or duped into some dark alley or side road where they\u2019re going to end up with a sideloaded app, even if they didn\u2019t intend to.\u201d\n If you\u2019ve ever had friends contact you in a panic, telling you their phone has been hit by malware, you\u2019ll understand just how sound Neuenschwander\u2019s argument is. Without iOS, users wouldn\u2019t have a mobile operating system platform they could choose from that is impossible to be targeted by malicious sideloading. In Apple\u2019s view, in other words: Do you want the best privacy and security possible? Your choice is iOS. Do you want sideloading? Your choice is Android.\n  Neuenschwander wouldn\u2019t speculate on just how much malware is floating around on the Android platform due to sideloading, but independent security experts have found a staggering amount of malware on Android devices\u2014 up to 15 times more\u00a0than iOS. One of the main vectors of attack?  Sideloaded apps.\n Even with the App Store\u2019s security measures in place, malware  does sneak onto iPhones. But Neuenschwander contends that its quantity \u201cwould be obviously much higher\u201d if Apple opened the iPhone to sideloading. Why? Because right now there are two security checks that protect users from malicious apps.\n The first is Apple\u2019s developer policies and processes, which regulate what an app can and cannot do. Apple can check whether a developer is following these policies, because a human reviews every app submitted to the App Store. And by the very act of uploading an app to the App Store, that app is also scanned for all known malware, protecting users from nefarious apps even more.\n  The second security check is the users themselves. Because Apple requires developers to ask the user for permission in a universal way before it can access such features as an iPhone\u2019s microphone or camera, a user can identify if something shady is going on inside the app.\n But if Apple were to allow sideloading via third-party app stores, it couldn\u2019t run those human and automated checks on apps posted to those stores\u2014negating that first important security check. It also couldn\u2019t verify that sideloaded apps are asking users for permission to access system services within the bounds they are used to, which means it would be easier to fool a user into granting a malicious app access to content such as their photos or messages.\n \u201cToday, we have our technical defenses, we have our policy defenses, and then we still have the user\u2019s own smarts,\u201d Neuenschwander says, referring to Apple\u2019s App Store processes. Sideloading would negate those defenses, he contends.\n  Some may argue that the drawbacks of sideloading would hit only those who sideload apps. Wouldn\u2019t those who still choose to download apps only through Apple\u2019s App Store be safe?\n But Neuenschwander points out (as does the company\u2019s white paper) that the mere existence of sideloaded apps would encourage bad actors to target unsuspecting users more by trying to lure them to download their malicious ones from unofficial stores or sites. You might be savvy and cautious enough to know a fake app store when you see it, but is your 15-year-old nephew or 75-year-old father?\n \u201cEven users who intend\u2014they\u2019ve consciously thought themselves that they are only going to download apps from the App Store\u2014well, the attackers know this, so they\u2019re going to try to convince that user that they\u2019re downloading an app from the App Store even when that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Neuenschwander says. \u201cReally, you have to think very creatively, very expansively as an attacker would trying to go after so many users with such rich data on their device. And so users will be attacked regardless of whether or not they intend to navigate app stores other than Apple\u2019s.\u201d\n  If you think that sounds far-fetched, let me introduce you to  the fake Google Play Store.\n  Despite Apple\u2019s insistence that sideloaded apps and app stores would be bad for both users who choose to access them and users who don\u2019t, it must be pointed out that Apple isn\u2019t against sideloading altogether. As a matter of fact, Apple\u2019s oldest platform allows it: MacOS.\n MacOS offers an App Store of its own, but you don\u2019t need to use it to download apps. You can also do so via third-party stores or websites. So why the discrepancy in policy between the Mac and iPhone when it comes to sideloading?\n  Part of the answer comes down to math. Neuenschwander notes that there are at least 10 times as many iPhones in the world as there are Macs, which makes the iPhone a much more enticing target to bad actors. An iPhone also likely carries much more sensitive user data than the average Mac does, and the iPhone is generally with a user everywhere they go.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the device you carry around with you,\u201d Neuenschwander notes. \u201cSo it knows your location. And therefore somebody who could attack that would get pattern-of-life details about you. It has a microphone, and therefore that\u2019s a microphone that could be around you much more than your Mac\u2019s microphone is likely to be. So the kind of sensitive data [on the iPhone] is more enticing to an attacker.\u201d\n But that\u2019s not all. \u201cThe pattern of use of the Mac\u2014just the style, how people use that platform\u2014tends to be that they get a few applications that they use to do their job or their hobby, and then it kind of reaches a steady state,\u201d Neuenschwander explains. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve all seen is that mobile platforms, including iPhone, are ones where users are downloading apps on a continuing basis. And that gives an attacker more opportunities to get in and get at that user. So the threat on the iOS side is much higher than the threat on the Mac side.\u201d\n  It should also be noted that at the recent  Epic Games v. Apple trial, Apple\u2019s software chief Craig Federighi  said there was an unacceptable level of malware on the Mac, an amount \u201cthat is much worse than iOS.\u201d It\u2019s understandable then that Apple doesn\u2019t want the problem to propagate over to the iPhone.\n If Apple ever does allow sideloading of iOS and iPadOS apps, it might be because it has no choice. Proposed laws in  Arizona and  North Dakota that aimed to break its App Store monopoly in those states have apparently failed. But the company  remains in legislators\u2019 crosshairs at the federal level, and antitrust remedies that would loosen its control over its platforms remain on the table.\n Still, I suspect the number of iPhone users who would like to see sideloading supported on iOS is relatively small. Device security and privacy are some of the most important aspects of any gadget, and a huge selling point for Apple products. It\u2019s hard to imagine that many iPhone users would be willing to sacrifice that for potentially dodgy sideloaded apps.\u00a0And if they  want to sacrifice security for sideloading, they  already have that choice: They can get an Android phone.\n  As for Neuenschwander, his argument against sideloading boils down to the case that everyone at Apple\u2014 including Tim Cook\u2014has been making all along. \u201cI believe that what we\u2019ve built and what we\u2019re offering users now is uniformly better, because we can focus in on that smaller attack surface and our stronger protections to help keep users safe,\u201d\u00a0Neuenschwander\u00a0says.\n Apple\u2019s white paper is out now  and can be accessed here. It\u2019s an interesting, nontechnical read for anyone pondering the pros and cons of sideloading and security.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:28:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "I made 56874 calls to explore the telephone network. Here\u2019s what I found.\n  This question appeared to me a while ago when leafing through an old telephone directory from the early 2000s.\n There are at least ordinary subscribers, business customer support lines, voice mails, and fax machines.Subscribers and customer support lines are not of special interest to me.I am more interested in automated systems that let the caller interact with them somehow.Voice mails and fax machines fit this definition.But is there something else as well?\n As the telephone network predates the Internet in Finland by over 100 years, the systems in it can be very old and obscure.Before the Internet gained popularity, these systems were used to provide similar services we use on the internet today.Would it not be interesting to explore a bit and see what has survived to this day?As there are no Shodan-like search engines for the telephone network, I needed to do the exploration myself.This post describes my exploration efforts.\n To explore, I used wardialing.Wardialing is a technique to call a list of telephone numbers automatically using a computer.Hackers of old used wardialing to explore the telephone network much like port-scanning is used today to explore the Internet.\n I used wardialing to call a bunch of numbers and recorded the first 60 seconds of audio received while staying quiet myself.This produced call recordings I could analyze to learn more about systems in the telephone network.To my knowledge, nobody has published the results of their wardialing efforts before.Especially about wardialing Finnish number-spaces or as recent as 2021.\n How I tried to avoid scaring people with ghost calls in the middle of the night\n On the receiving end, wardialing causes a ghost call.You get a call, which you pick up, but the caller remains silent.After a while, the caller hangs up.This alone can feel threatening to some people.What if additionally you were woken up by the call in the middle of the night and later you learned that everything you said on phone was recorded, shared with third parties, and published?I would be angry.Therefore, I took action to minimize any harm caused to the owners of phone numbers called.\n Voice is personal information in itself.People may also disclose information on the phone they do not want to be shared or published.To avoid violating people\u2019s privacy, I did the following:\n Ensured that any recording of private individuals did not end up outside the EU, being saved by third parties, or used to train machine learning models\n To avoid calling people altogether or flooding emergency services, I chose to call a number space that is typically not used by ordinary subscribers or emergency lines.I also chose to hide the number I was calling from (displays unknown number at the receiver\u2019s end) in hopes that people would not pick up my calls.\n I could have further minimized the personal information collection by recording each call for a shorter amount of time.This however would have made it harder to classify the recordings and recognize the service at the other end.The 60-second recording was considered optimal as it is enough for the call to be connected and for any recordings to play long enough to make sense of them.\n Despite my efforts to not harass private individuals, I woke at least 3 persons in the middle of the night.This was judged by their announcement of the time when answering or apparent sleepiness.My apologies to them!\n As wardialing was done at a very modest speed, I considered it to not be harmful to the bandwidth of the service providers.\n  Since I have no copper Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) line in my house, I had to look for other ways to wardial.I discovered a modern wardialer,  WarVOX, that uses VoIP for calling.I decided to use it.\n To work, WarVOX requires a VoIP trunk.VoIP trunk is a service that acts as a gateway between IP network and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).There are a few VoIP trunking services in Finland, but they are either for business customers only, or expensive for only occasional wardialing.I also assume they would not be happy with wardialing.Foreign VoIP trunking services are expensive for wardialing Finnish phone numbers.\n After learning about illegal termination in the VoIP business, I learned that there is equipment, such as VoIP GSM gateways, that can be used to set up your own VoIP trunk.Curiously, this equipment comes with the possibility to change the IMSI number.VoIP GSM gateways act as bridges between IP network and the PSTN network through the GSM network.\n With SIM card(s) inside, they connect to the PSTN network like your mobile phone does, allowing you to make and receive calls.On the IP network, they provide an interface, such as SIP, which can be used to programmatically make and receive calls.\n I bought the cheapest VoIP GSM gateway, which provides a SIP interface on the IP network.WarVOX speaks IAX2, not SIP, so I had to configure Asterisk as a proxy between the two protocols.\n To connect to the PSTN network, I bought the cheapest prepaid SIM with a 5 EUR credit.If the service provider does not like my actions, they can simply block this SIM card.\n   Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) publishes  decisions regarding telephone network numberings on their website.I used the  Finland\u2019s E164 numbering plan as a starting point for choosing target phone numbers to call.This document from early 2019 specifies the different number spaces and describes their purpose on a high level.\n  No private individuals (I did not want to annoy and scare people with ghost calls in the middle of the night)\n In the end, the freephone space (usage \u201cNon-geographic number - Nationwide service numbers (freephone)\u201d on Finland\u2019s R164 numbering plan) was determined to be the best candidate.The subscriber pays a higher fee for the numbers in this space to cover the costs of the callers.Thus the numbers in this space cost nothing to call so it fits the first requirement.\n I imagine the higher fee would keep the number of private individuals at a minimum, as you would not expect private individuals to pay higher fees so that they can be called for free.Therefore it hypothetically fits the second requirement.\n The number of systems in the freephone space is hard to predict.Having systems in this space would make sense to centralize the costs of using them.\n In the numbering plan, there is also a space for Machine-to-Machine communication that sounds like it contains only machines.Unfortunately, the space is so huge (11 digits) that it is very hard to find numbers that are in use in it.I initially chose this space but gave up after calling over 10 000 numbers without a single answer.\n  The bought VoIP GSM Gateway fits only a single SIM card, and it only supports a single line.Therefore I could only make a single call at a time.The calls were made randomly to numbers belonging to the freephone space.\n WarVOX spent 60 seconds on every call, whether it was answered or not.This resulted in a wardialing speed of 1 call/minute.For 56874 calls, this means roughly 40 days calling day and night.\n The time required to connect the call and the time it takes for someone to pick up is deducted from the 60 seconds.This means that the recordings are all shorter than 60 seconds.\n I configured the VoIP GSM Gateway to not send Caller ID, so fewer people would pick up and nobody would call me back.\n   After running WarVOX, I was left with audio files containing recordings of 1724 answered calls.WarVOX identifies Modems and Fax machines automatically and provides signal graphs for all recordings.The signal graphs can be used to sort the recordings by similarity, but I found this to be poor for classifying and identifying the recordings.\n To avoid listening to all recordings myself, used Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to transcribe the recordings, and then used the transcriptions to aside the call recordings that have the same message.This reduced the number of calls to listen manually to around 300, a bearable number.\n I then manually listened to the different recordings and classified them according to the following diagram:\n  In the diagram, prospect calls are classified and each classification is marked either not interesting or interesting.The interesting ones are the answers that let the caller interact with the service somehow, or may let, as in the case of music and unknown systems.How many recordings each classification contains is visible in the diagram.\n All calls answered by a human were either  businesses or  private individuals.I recognized private individuals from businesses by the informal style of answering the phone.\n It is not possible to determine what exactly there are at the other end when there is only  silence or  ringback on the wire.The fact that the recordings contain ringback indicates though that there is a PBX on the receiving end, which picks up and then tries calling an extension.\n All recordings that were answered by a machine were recordings of human voice,  fax machines, music, or unknown (machine). Music contains recordings that contain music for the whole recording. Unknown (machine) contains recordings of calls that contain electromechanical sound.\n Recordings of human voice were either  announcements that announced something (such as number not in use) or asked for input.Recordings asking for input were either  test numbers,  voice mails,  teleconferencing services or they could not be identified, thus  unknown (waiting for input).\n In total, only 3% of calls were answered.Out of these, 69% were identified as interesting.Thus only 2% of all calls got an interesting answer.\n  As the large majority of interesting recordings that wait for input were unknown, I decided to classify them further.The classification was done by identical recording content.Different recordings inside categories are called variants.Based on this classification, there are 74 unique interesting answers.\n The category of unknown recordings that wait for caller input contained 16 different variants.There were 2 different test number variants.The voice mail category contained 23 different variants and there were 24 different variants in the teleconference category.All fax machines sound the same to my ears, while there were 7 different songs played at my wardialing setup.Finally, both unknown machines sounded identical to me.\n   I hypothesize that all interesting recordings, except fax machines and unknown machines, are services offered by Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs).PBXs are telephone systems usually used by businesses that switch calls between multiple users and which can offer additional services such as voice mail and teleconferencing.\n There was a large number of answers from  Unknown (waiting for input), systems waiting for input that did not hint at what service they provide.Part of them ask for a PIN code or menu option using a dial-pad, others for voice commands.\n The ones asking for PIN could be for example voicemail boxes or teleconferencing services.Maybe they could be authentications to remote-controlled PBXs too?The only ways to find out would be to ask someone or trying to brute force the codes.Brute forcing is however illegal.\n  The ones asking for voice commands were bots.There was one Finnish and one English bot.They could be investigated further by interacting with them.\n   The former announces that it is an ICS test platform and proceeds to offer DTMF and FAX testing.The latter test service seems to belong to Twilio, an American communication platform provider.It offers DTMF testing, CL readback, echo test, and an SMS menu.\n Voice mail is still used.Part of the recordings were business voice mails asking for customer feedback or contact details.The rest were ordinary ones simply asking for messages after the beep.\n Teleconferencing was a popular service offered in among the recognized interesting recordings.Most of them seemed to be offered by businesses.The exact use cases of the teleconferencing services were not revealed.They could be company internal or aimed at external users.\n  11 Calls were answered with only  music.The music could indicate something, such as being in queue for some service.All music variants except for one sounded like generic elevator music that could be the default hold music in PBXs.\n  Two calls were answered identically by some  unknown machine.It was not possible to identify what kind of machines they are from the recording alone.They sound electromechanical.\n  There was a single response that was present in 1074 answered calls (91% of all interesting answers) and that waits for the caller to interact with itself.It says \u201cTervetuloa palveluun\u201d (Welcome to the service) followed by repeating \u201cAnna tunnusluku\u201d (Please give access code).The machine does not give any hint of what kind of service it is.\n I contacted Finnish telecommunications company Elisa in hopes they could identify this service.This post will be updated once I get an answer.\n  2 unknown machines sound electromechanical.These mystery machines sound like something out of  Evan Doorbell\u2019s tapes.I contacted Evan in hopes he will recognize the machines and will update this post in case he does.\n   This same recording was played at my wardialing setup on two different numbers.I was very surprised to hear this bizarre message about the end of the world and a zombie apocalypse when listening to the recordings.\n Googling the numbers or the sentences on the recording did not tell me what this is.The recordings sound like captchas.Note that I pressed no touch tones!\n  Maple confirmation message for Clevercrossing.There were 6 of these.What could this be?A confirmation message for what?\n   English speech bot that does not understand silence and is going to escalate my call:\n      Based on my results, there are private and business telephones, fax machines, PBXs, and unidentified systems.The PBXs serve for example as teleconferencing systems, test numbers, and voice mails.Some PBXs may also have other purposes, but this research was not enough to find out what.\n The systems I was not able to identify, such as the unknown machines and the unknown PBX services, could turn out to be something unexpected.Therefore if you know what they are, please contact me!You can find a link to the recordings at the end of this post.\n I cannot fully answer the original question, because of the narrow number space selection and relatively small sample size.My exercise thus serves better as a peek into what kind of systems there are in the Finnish freephone number space in 2021.\n I only called the numbers and passively listened for 60 seconds.It would be interesting to attempt interacting with the discovered services somehow and see how they react.\n Another idea would be to wardial other phone number spaces with the same methodology.The E164 numbering plan states that phone numbers of length 5 digits are still in use for older assignments.Therefore, it is a promising target to discover older services.As a bonus, this number space is sufficiently small to call through in a reasonable time.However, this range may contain service numbers that charge premium rates.\n  All raw recordings marked interesting in the sorting figure, except voice mail, are available  here.\n Voice mails are not published as part of them contain a recording of the owners themselves or the owner\u2019s number is being read by the recording.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:28:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Rooftop bouquets of dirty satellite dishes, jumbled architectural styles united by peeling paint, variously shaped (and largely face-masked) life-forms jostling on the sidewalk\u2014each sign of shabby modernity feels like something I glimpsed in childhood while hypnotized by George Lucas. In the director\u2019s 1977 space fantasy, wizards lived in what appeared to be crumbling stucco huts, and moon-size superweapons had onboard trash compactors. As a kid, I believed that Earth was just another planet in Lucas\u2019s universe. Today, I\u2019m still susceptible to that lovely illusion.\n The  Star Wars franchise offers action and escapism, but re-enchanting our own world was always its greatest trick. As Luke Skywalker rises from backwater farmhand to galactic savior over the course of the first three films, audiences gain a visceral sense of why the galaxy he lives in is worth saving. Debris-strewn sets convey that exotic planets have history and commerce. Silly-looking critters and robots carry themselves with dignity and purpose.  A supernatural \u201cForce\u201d hums throughout the interstellar menagerie. Viewers come to feel a humanistic, or even animistic, connection.  Star Wars immerses you in the awesome knowledge that peripheral things\u2014the neighbors you don\u2019t understand, the buildings you don\u2019t notice\u2014have their own sagas.\n  Right now,  Star Wars is at a turning point. Lucas\u2019s original vision famously inspired an era of big-budget blockbuster movies whose creators, just as famously, eventually ran out of new ideas and came to rely on sequels and spin-offs. Inevitably,  Star Wars itself succumbed to that fate. After releasing  a divisive trio of prequels around the turn of the millennium, in 2012 Lucas sold his franchise to Disney, Hollywood\u2019s chief recycler of old stories. Fresh  Star Wars films began to roll out in 2015. Though early acclaim and profits were impressive, creative troubles began to hurt the bottom line. In 2019,  dismayed reviews and relatively soft ticket sales greeted  The Rise of Skywalker, the finale of a trilogy set 30 years after the action of the first films. Around that time, Disney\u2019s CEO, Bob Iger, announced a moviemaking \u201chiatus\u201d for  Star Wars.\n Had Lucas\u2019s galaxy lost its power, or had its new stewards simply mismanaged it? The recent success of a remarkable  Star Wars television series suggests the latter. When the streaming-TV service Disney+ launched in late 2019, it featured  The Mandalorian, which picks up five years after the events of the original trilogy, and follows the adventures of a mysterious mercenary who has sworn never to take off his helmet. By the end of Season 2, a critical consensus had emerged: It was the best live-action  Star Wars product to arrive since the early 1980s. Millions of viewers cooed over the short-statured enigma known to fans as Baby Yoda, who has a price on his adorable head for unknown reasons. As  The Mandalorian\u2019s laconic and lethal hero travels from one planet to the next, the sublime feeling of immersion that laced Lucas\u2019s early movies reemerges. To watch the show and then look back at the sweep of  Star Wars history is to understand where that feeling comes from\u2014and why most of Hollywood\u2019s hero-driven, special-effects-laden fantasies never attain it.\n of  The Mandalorian unspools like a thin, near-invisible thread: Each week, the protagonist completes a discrete quest that unobtrusively points the way toward the next quest. The pleasure of watching lies very much in the journey and not the destination. This episodic, open-ended style of entertainment is a hallmark of dramatic TV\u2014but it\u2019s also very  Star Wars. Soon after its initial success, the first movie was retitled  Episode IV\u2014A New Hope because Lucas wanted viewers to feel as though the film were one chapter in an ongoing Saturday-morning serial. In the new book   Secrets of the Force: The Complete, Uncensored, Unauthorized Oral History of Star Wars, by Edward Gross and Mark A. Altman, Lucas says this of his work on the first film \u200a: \u201cIt\u2019s always been what you might call a good man in search of a story.\u201d\n What Lucas means is that when conceiving  Star Wars, he dreamed first of visuals, concepts, and feelings\u2014not of plot. He felt drawn to make \u201ca movie in outer space like  Flash Gordon used to be. Ray guns, running around in spaceships, shooting at each other.\u201d He also wanted to mash up tropes from samurai films, Westerns, and spy flicks. Above all, he wanted a look and feel that prized \u201ccredibility\u201d rather than the \u201cclean,\u201d sleek sci-fi of 1950s serials and  2001: A Space Odyssey. His own days working in a greasy mechanics\u2019 shop, plus the thought of NASA\u2019s Apollo capsule returning from the moon full of \u201ccandy wrappers and old Tang jars,\u201d informed that vision.\n Without a narrative he was burning to tell, Lucas had trouble turning such notions into a workable screenplay. He wrote multiple, overlong drafts that each radically refigured its characters, arcs, and themes. Eventually, he arrived at a relatively straightforward tale modeled on ancient legends. Lucas had been reading the work of Joseph Campbell, a literary scholar who identified a \u201cmonomyth,\u201d with a predictable structure, occurring across cultures throughout the centuries.  Star Wars would be a Chosen One story; Luke Skywalker was like King Arthur or Siddhartha Gautama. This blueprint, with its prescribed wise-mentor figures, talismanic weapons, and trusty sidekicks, helped make the mess of a script gel.\n  Lucas\u2019s reverse-engineered fairy tale resonated with audiences, but  Star Wars aficionados tend to overrate plot when explaining his success; books have been written about the profundity of Luke\u2019s search for identity. In the new oral history, the critic Roy Morton articulates conventional wisdom when he argues that Lucas\u2019s \u201cmost significant creative decision in crafting the script\u201d was to draw from myths. Disney\u2019s chief  Star Wars executive, Kathleen Kennedy, says that \u201cwhat was really important to [Lucas]\u2014and certainly important to me\u2014was story.\u201d Whenever  Star Wars films have faltered with audiences, commentators have blamed shoddy storytelling: the needless complexity of Lucas\u2019s prequels,  the inconsistent logic of Disney\u2019s sequels.\n Yet the hero\u2019s journey in the original movies was always sketchy. The opening 15 minutes of  A New Hope feature strikingly few recognizable human characters, and Luke Skywalker is usually the least interesting thing in any scene that follows. A lot of the film\u2019s suspense derives more from wondering what the movie\u2019s  about\u2014the touristic curiosity of \u201cWhere is this going?\u201d\u2014than from tracking clues to how Luke will fulfill his destiny.  Secrets of the Force documents that the trilogy\u2019s iconic twists, which would seem key to choreographing a monomyth, nearly weren\u2019t filmed. In the shooting script for  A New Hope, the mentor figure, Obi-Wan Kenobi, survives to the end rather than dying midway through. Some drafts of the second film,  The Empire Strikes Back, don\u2019t indicate that the evil Darth Vader is Luke\u2019s father. Glorious though such surprises are, Lucas\u2019s work wasn\u2019t driven by them.\n In fact, the story crescendos are compelling because they double as world-building. Learning who Darth Vader really is raises a host of tantalizing questions about the history of the galaxy (not least,  how does someone become Darth Vader?). Kenobi\u2019s early-movie references to mysterious concepts such as \u201cthe dark times\u201d\u2014exposition left unfinished once he dies\u2014also spark rich intrigue. \u201cLucas makes movies that are intentionally designed to have holes in them that need to be filled later,\u201d the producer Brian Volk-Weiss says in the oral history. He\u2019s right except for one thing: Do they need to be filled in? Many a mediocre  Star Wars product has arisen from trying to define every entry in the galactic glossary. The original films work precisely because of the holes.\n They also work because Lucas, as a filmmaker, was fastidious about blending novelty with naturalism. Directing the initial movie, he insisted that the sets be streaked with scum and scorch marks. He spliced together  footage of World War II dogfights and then invented special effects to make space battles look like those dogfights. When the time came to shoot, Mark Hamill (who plays Luke) first delivered his lines with campy panache\u2014but Lucas encouraged him to be more low-key. \u201cThese actors believed the world they were in,\u201d Liam Neeson, a star of 1999\u2019s  The Phantom Menace, says in  Secrets of the Force. \u201cMark Hamill jumps into his speeder and\u2014phooph!\u2014he\u2019s off ... To them, it was everyday stuff.\u201d\n Such far-out realism has rarely been achieved since then. In the dreary prequels, Lucas went overboard with then-novel computer-generated imagery, losing the lived-in feel he\u2019d once prized. The Disney sequels are too frantically paced\u2014and too packed with winks to old  Star Wars films\u2014for viewers to settle in with the new sets, creatures, and costumes. Both of those later trilogies told strenuously mythic stories: The prequels followed the tragic transformation of a hero into a villain, and the Disney movies amounted to another Chosen One tale. The flaws of their scripts have been rightly scrutinized, but fixing those flaws would not solve the more fundamental failures of execution. When  Star Wars is bad, its galaxy feels like a thing on a screen\u2014not a place you can go.\n of  The Mandalorian, thankfully, is sturdy, like well-worn concrete. The hero flies a rickety spaceship modeled on a \u201970s warplane. Baby Yoda\u2019s twitching puppet ears convey the expressive range of actual toddlers. Most important, the showrunner, Jon Favreau, has absorbed the take-your-time, exploratory ethos of Lucas\u2019s first trilogy. One early episode spends 10 dialogue-free minutes following the Mandalorian as he tries to survive on an arid planet. Two episodes later, the Mandalorian arrives in a forested village where locals harvest bioluminescent krill from ponds. He doesn\u2019t just save the village from a hostile tribe\u2019s attacks. He moves in to live the  Star Wars simple life for a few weeks.\n Such wanderings do have a mythic quality. The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda are an odd couple: protector and charge, father and son, man and beast. There is also a running plot, involving a black-armored arch-villain, that fulfills the demands of modern blockbusters to set up future spin-offs (10 other  Star Wars TV shows were announced in December). When the second season culminated in a CGI-assisted cameo from the original-trilogy cast,  some critics fretted that the show was about to devolve into Hollywood hackery. But thus far, archetypal storytelling and serialized intrigue\u2014ingredients often misused in franchise-driven entertainment\u2014have mainly just anchored Favreau\u2019s careful creative riffing. If the miracle of  The Mandalorian continues, viewers of future seasons will only rarely notice an overdetermined hand of fate guiding the action. They\u2019ll instead continue to be caught up in individual moments.\n To cheer for a Hollywood product that emphasizes look and feel rather than story and character may sound superficial. But in life, aesthetics are not incidental. The dents on a vehicle tell a story. So does the glint in a stranger\u2019s eyes. Tidy plots are scarce, and populations do not readily divide into Chosen Ones and Unchosen Ones.  Star Wars has proved that mass entertainment can wake us up to such realities. My favorite of the many arcs in  The Mandalorian involves a froglike creature carrying her unhatched eggs to another planet. Because the alien doesn\u2019t speak his language, the Mandalorian treats her coldly\u2014until she commandeers a droid\u2019s translation system and delivers a desperate plea for help. Watching that scene jangled my empathy so much that I began to look even at subway rats with a sense of wonder.

If that person launched into a monologue beginning, \u201cIt is the district of glorified dancing girls and millionaire playboys and, on a different plane, of dime-a-dance hostesses and pleasure-seeking clerks. Here, too, in a permanent moralizing tableau, appear the extremes of success and failure characteristic of Broadway\u2019s spectacular professions: gangsters and racketeers, panhandlers and derelicts, youthful stage stars and aging burlesque comedians, world heavyweight champions and once-acclaimed beggars,\u201d and then that person recounted the history of every theater and club, the development of the area\u2019s rapid public transit, and the origin of the phrase \u201cthe Great White Way\u201d (coined, supposedly, in 1901 by the adman O. J. Gude), all in a tone both disdainful and celebratory of the famed intersection that \u201clights the clouds above Manhattan with a glow like that of a dry timber fire\u201d\u2014you would know what it was like to read the  American Guides, a curious series of books that appeared during the last years of the Great Depression. Specifically, you\u2019d know what it was like to read the  New York City Guide, which was published in 1939. And you\u2019d be no closer to Times Square.\n  Alongside New York City, there was a guide for every state (48 of them then), plus the District of Columbia, the Alaska Territory, Puerto Rico, many cities and towns, locales such as Death Valley, and routes such as U.S. 1. The public bought them, expecting concise and functional travel companions. But the hefty  American Guides were something else.\n   These books sprawled. They hoarded and gossiped and sat you down for a lecture. They seemed to address multiple readers at once from multiple perspectives. Most were divided into three sections. First, perplexed readers paged through essays on history, industry, folkways, and other subjects. Then came profiles of notable cities and towns, and finally, a collection of automobile tours across the state. The tours highlighted scenic overlooks and recreation spots, but also infamous massacres, labor strikes, witches, gunfighters, Continental Army spies, Confederate deserters, shipwrecks, slave rebellions, famous swindlers, and forgotten poets. They traveled through towns with bizarre names and towns founded by religious cults. They paused for every old-timer\u2019s story that could be fastened to a patch of ground. They mentioned all the places where Washington ever slept (or so it seemed). They included research on subjects of little use to a traveler (the structure of local government, a state\u2019s literary residents) but barely noted diners, motels, and gas stations. They were rich and weird and frustrating. They guided tourists across the land but also deep into the national character, into a past that was assembled from the mythic and the prosaic, the factual and the farcical. The tours seemed less accessories for motorists than rambling day trips through the unsorted mind of the republic.\n  This shaggy opulence, this Americana maximalism, made the guides unusual. But their provenance made them remarkable. They weren\u2019t issued by some erratic publisher or obsessive tourist association: They were created by the federal government through the Federal Writers\u2019 Project, a division of the New Deal\u2019s Works Progress Administration. The  American Guides were among the unlikeliest weapons in the improvised arsenal that the Roosevelt administration brought to bear upon the Depression.\n  Launched soon after the formation of the WPA in 1935, the FWP provided work for unemployed writers, whether professional or aspiring, competent or otherwise. The program wasn\u2019t huge, comparatively. The entire WPA employed more than 2 million people a month, on average, while the FWP typically had 4,500 to 5,200 workers and peaked at 6,686, all scattered in offices around the country. They came from a range of professions: mostly white-collar workers whose jobs had disappeared and who were better suited to desk labor than, say, draining malarial swampland, along with poets and novelists, including some significant writers whose fame had been eclipsed by the Depression and others who had yet to become famous. (Richard Wright and Zora Neale Hurston were among those who collected an FWP paycheck.)\n   The FWP was a work-relief program, and its primary mission was to help writers survive the Depression, while putting cash into circulation and contributing, however modestly, to the economic recovery. But it was also a literary endeavor of unprecedented scale. When the FWP was finally dissolved, along with the rest of the WPA, in 1943,  Time magazine gave it the epitaph \u201cthe biggest literary project in history\u201d\u2014a claim that does not seem to be disputed.\n  The project might have been a disaster. Many doubted that staffing an unwieldy government bureaucracy with temperamental and often desperate writers\u2014not a few impaired by heavy drinking, professional jealousy, political sectarianism, or all three\u2014could lead to any good outcome. (The journalist Dorothy Thompson remarked, \u201cProject? For Writers? Absurd!\u201d and the poet W. H. Auden, unknowingly echoing Thompson, later called the entire WPA arts program \u201cone of the noblest and most absurd undertakings ever attempted by a state.\u201d) But from 1937, when the first guides appeared, to the project\u2019s end, the FWP managed to produce at least 1,000 publications and gather reams of unused material. (Some of these manuscripts, especially individual life histories and  the testimonials of formerly enslaved people, would be treasured and interrogated by future scholars.) Each successful publication chipped away at assumptions about the FWP, proving that it was no hopeless boondoggle for failed writers and unimaginative hacks. Reviewers were generally impressed, finding that the books far surpassed their expectations. The guides seemed, in their own odd and beguiling way, to represent a distinct aesthetic achievement.\n  The critic Alfred Kazin ended his book  On Native Grounds\u2014written contemporaneously with the FWP\u2014by taking up the \u201cliterature of nationhood\u201d that had emerged most forcefully after the crash of 1929. As Kazin described it, this genre comprised an upsurge of disparate writing \u201cwhose subject was the American scene and whose drive always was the need \u2026 to chart America and to possess it.\u201d Edmund Wilson\u2019s book of reportage  The American Jitters fit this pattern by issuing dispatches from the great national unraveling. So did  You Have Seen Their Faces, a documentary record of the southern poor, written by Erskine Caldwell and photographed by Margaret Bourke-White, which forced an introduction between its readers and their often-overlooked fellow citizens. Books such as these had literary ancestors in Ralph Waldo Emerson, who struggled to conjure up a distinct and meaningful American spirit at his desk, and in Walt Whitman, who chased that spirit down and sought to become possessed by it.\n The  American Guides epitomized this new literature. Kazin singled them out for praise and insisted on their literary merit (the superior volumes, anyway), perhaps because he knew that they had surpassed the low expectations of so many reviewers. In 1942, the books were still fresh\u2014several had only just been published\u2014but Kazin had a clear view of where they belonged in his story of American literature:\n The WPA state guides, seemingly only a makeshift, a stratagem of administrative relief policy to tide a few thousand people along and keep them working, a business of assigning individuals of assorted skills and interests to map the country, mile by mile, resulted in an extraordinary contemporary epic. Out of the need to find something to say about every community and the country around it, out of the vast storehouse of facts behind the guides\u2014geological, geographic, meteorological, ethnological, historical, political, sociological, economic\u2014there emerged an America unexampled in density and regional diversity \u2026 More than any other literary form in the thirties, the WPA writers\u2019 project, by illustrating how much so many collective skills could do to uncover the collective history of the country, set the tone of the period.\n  The  American Guides, in other words, could not be dismissed as mere curiosities\u2014or as evidence of the New Dealers\u2019 mania for spending tax dollars in creative ways. The books were key to understanding the historical moment, because the guides, as Kazin put it, had become \u201ca repository as well as a symbol of the reawakened American sense of its own history.\u201d\n  The guides\u2019 wandering, capacious, and yet startlingly resonant take on the American experience explains why so many people, including myself, have been drawn to these books and the story of how they came to be\u2014how it was that the federal government ended up in the publishing business, with such a peculiar list of titles to show for it. As a historical undertaking and a collective editorial project\u2014created under conditions of enormous strain, at a scale never attempted, by workers grappling with the stresses of poverty and, for many, their own inexperience\u2014the  American Guides were a triumph. But the books themselves are not triumphalist. They carry a whiff of New Deal optimism, sure, but for the most part they resist those signature American habits of boosterism and aggressive national mythologizing. As the young novelist Robert Cantwell wrote in  The New Republic in 1939, the guides are \u201ca grand, melancholy, formless, democratic anthology of frustration and idiosyncrasy, a majestic roll call of national failure, a terrible and yet engaging corrective to the success stories that dominate our literature.\u201d\n  Cantwell was right. For books that are ostensibly travel guides, the FWP publications have a habit of wandering off\u2014steering, more often than not, down forgotten back roads and toward the dead ends of American history. But that was the point. The guides do form \u201ca majestic roll call of national failure,\u201d as Cantwell put it, and also more than that. They are melancholic at times, but they are exuberant, suggestive, slapdash, overdetailed, and overconfident too. The spirit of the guides, in other words, is multitudinous and democratic\u2014they have a fundamentally public orientation to match the public enterprise that created them. They don\u2019t offer one way of looking at a state but several. They contain many voices but, as books for travelers, they convey essentially a single invitation to explore, to roam, to inquire.\n  These books, with their range of perspectives, emerged from the work of a diverse group of writers\u2014some who were among the boldest names in the history of 20th-century American literature and others who never quite escaped the pages of little magazines and obscure manifestos. These writers, whatever their relative renown, labored alongside thousands of others whose contributions are difficult to trace but who made up the majority of FWP workers, the ones who showed up to offices or issued field reports from everywhere in the country. They all experienced life on the project in different, and often totally opposing, ways. They loved the work; they felt like hacks. They saw the FWP as launching their careers; they saw it as a sad and bitter end. Black writers were marginalized, and yet a remarkable group of them produced groundbreaking studies of African American life. Native Americans were also largely excluded as workers in roles across the FWP, though nearly every guide includes references to their history. These passages are typically bundled up with sections about archaeology rather than appearing in essays on the contemporary scene; the guides, in other words, are often guilty of relegating Native Americans to the past rather than portraying them as active participants in the present. The guides themselves, meant to convey an argument about inclusion and pluralism, were sometimes undermined by their own creators\u2014and the compromises of language and of emphasis involved in their creation.\n  By plucking its workers from all corners of the land, the FWP inevitably became a showcase for their ideas, aspirations, and prejudices. All the tensions of American society in the \u201930s were stuffed between the lines of the project\u2019s books and pamphlets. The program was a roiling and seething experiment, and even its participants could not agree on what it all meant: Was it a noble vehicle for progressive patriotism, a fount of radical propaganda, or a bureaucratic instrument for managing social strife and whitewashing history? Was it all of these? The guides don\u2019t provide an obvious answer. Instead, they offer a snapshot of a nation reckoning with urgent questions\u2014about historical progress, the role of government, and the future of democracy itself\u2014at a moment when all the old answers seemed to be dissolving.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 20:26:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u65c5\u884c,weird,\u793e\u4f1a", "title":

", "note_en": "Apple    AAPL  1.27%  is stepping up its fight to maintain tight controls over which apps can be installed onto customers\u2019 iPhones, as political pressure grows in Washington, D.C. and Brussels to upend those restrictions.\n  In a report released Wednesday, the company argues that allowing users to download apps directly onto their iPhones without having to use Apple\u2019s App Store would harm customers by threatening privacy protections, complicating parental controls and potentially exposing users\u2019 data to ransomware attacks.\n  Apple\u2019s defense of its mobile operating system, or iOS, comes ahead of an expected debate Wednesday in the House Judiciary Committee on a package of  bills aimed at reining in the nation\u2019s largest tech companies.\n    Provisions in one of the bills, known as the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, could effectively give Apple\u2019s customers broader control over which apps to download on their devices. It could prohibit Apple from continuing to block a practice known as sideloading, in which users install apps directly onto their iPhones without having to go through the company\u2019s App Store. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act was  introduced in December and is making its way through the legislative process. It too includes provisions to open the door to sideloading.\n    Apple isn\u2019t the only tech company taking issue with the House committee\u2019s package of bills. Brian Huseman,  Amazon.com    AMZN  1.49%  vice president of public policy, said in a statement Tuesday that the proposed legislative language \u201cwould have significant negative effects on the hundreds of thousands of American small- and medium-sized businesses that sell in our store, and tens of millions of consumers who buy products from  Amazon  \u201d He urged the committee to delay action and assess the impact of the bills.\n  Apple\u2019s report before the committee\u2019s Wednesday meeting follows comments by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook during a virtual appearance at a Paris tech conference last week, in which he said that sideloading would damage privacy and security.\n  The Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group that includes Epic Games Inc. and  Spotify Technology  praised the legislation to allow sideloading. The group\u2019s executive director, Meghan DiMuzio, called it \u201can important step as momentum builds to hold platforms accountable for their anticompetitive behavior.\u201d Epic and Spotify both  have battled with Apple over  its rules regarding the App Store.\n    Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% of revenue generated by apps distributed through its digital store and imposes rules on content and other practices. The App Store was a major driver of  its $16.9 billion in services revenue generated in the most recent quarter.\n  \u201cAllowing sideloading would degrade the security of the iOS platform and expose users to serious security risks not only on third-party app stores, but also on the App Store,\u201d Apple said in the report Wednesday. \u201cBecause of the large size of the iPhone user base and the sensitive data stored on their phones\u2014photos, location data, health and financial information\u2014allowing sideloading would spur a flood of new investment into attacks on the platform.\u201d\n  Mr. Cook has made privacy a cornerstone of Apple\u2019s product pitch in recent years, rolling out additional tools  to make it harder for other companies to use iPhone users\u2019 data for profit. He has often drawn a contrast between Apple\u2019s business model of mostly selling devices and computers to that of tech rivals who make their fortunes from online ads, such as  Alphabet  Google.\n  Mr. Cook last week said Google\u2019s mobile operating system, Android, was at a greater risk of malware than Apple\u2019s. Android allows sideloading, and Google has defended its security in the past. Google\u2019s most recent transparency report said less than 0.2%\u00a0of Android devices have installed a malicious app through Google Play.\n  Apple\u2019s business practices regarding its App Store and third-party software were at the heart of a courtroom drama in May that pitted the company against one of the world\u2019s most popular videogame makers, Epic Games. The antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic aims to allow it to offer its games on Apple devices outside the App Store. Epic has said that Apple improperly controls the distribution of software onto devices it sells and forces developers to use its in-app payment system.\n  Epic said that the practice of sideloading on iPhones would be no different from what Apple allows on its PCs, where users can easily download software.\n  Apple pushed back against that argument. The company told the judge that threats against the iPhone are unique because of its nature as a phone and said that its process of vetting apps before distribution helped ensure security. The judge is expected to issue her ruling in the coming weeks.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:42:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Last Updated: June 18, 2021      Sony knew that 3D hardware can get very messy to develop for. Thus, their debuting console will keep its design  simple and  practical&amp;mldr Although this may come with a cost!\n   The main processor is one of those \u2018x designed by y, based on z and second-sourced from w\u2019 which is a bit dense to summarise in a few sentences, so why don\u2019t we start with some historical context?\n The early nineties were marked by a change in the fates of many popular CPUs. The once-leading 8-bit CPUs, such as the  Z80 and  6502, were already out of spotlight and Motorola\u2019s famous  68000, along with other  16-bit designs that enjoyed success in the late 80s, had become candidates for replacement. Even at this time in the PC world, Tanenbaum, in his celebrated debate with Torvalds, gave Intel\u2019s x86 architecture only  five more years until its demise from the home market.\n At first it may look as if technological development had hit a wall at this point. But in reality there was a new wave of relatively-unknown CPUs making their way into mainstream devices. Many of these designs had originated in academia, and so existed to prove particular sets of design ideas. Examples of next-gen CPUs at this point included:\n  All of these processors had something in common: They followed the  Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) discipline, which radically shifted how these chips had to be designed and programmed. One rule of RISC CPUs dictated that a single instruction can\u2019t mix memory with register operations, allowing hardware designers to simplify the circuitry that executes instructions&amp;mldr and then enhance it with parallelism techniques.\n In the late 80s, MIPS CPUs became a topic of conversion after being adopted (and later acquired) by Silicon Graphics Incorporated (SGI) to power their equipment. SGI was an influential innovator in the computer graphics market, especially with the development of  hardware-accelerated vertex pipelines, whose task was originally carried out by software (within the CPU).\n During the development of the PlayStation, MIPS was offering the  R3000A series of processors. These were 32-bit machines and part of their low-end catalogue. Consequently, while the R3000A was not part of the flagship lineup (unlike the R4000, which  others would later choose), it was an attractive investment in terms of cost.\n Sony designed their audio and graphics chips in-house, but they still needed the leading chip that could drive those two. The selected CPU had to be powerful enough to show off the  impressive capabilities of Sony\u2019s chips, but also affordable to keep the console at a competitive price.\n At the same time,  LSI Logic (a semiconductor manufacturer) was providing a \u2018build-your-own\u2019 CPU program to businesses. This service was referred to as  CoreWare and it enabled clients to build their own CPU packages by choosing a series of building blocks. Part of the CoreWare library included the \u2018CW33300\u2019 block, a CPU core derived from the LSI LR33300, an off-the-shelf CPU chip which LSI also commercialised.\n Now, where am I going with all this? It turns out LSI\u2019s LR33300 and CW33300 are a  binary-compatible version of the MIPS R3000A family. Their architectures slightly differ in some areas but the programming interface (MIPS I ISA) remains the same.\n In the end, Sony commissioned LSI to build their CPU package. They chose the CW33000, changed some bits and combined it with other blocks to form the chip you find on the PlayStation\u2019s motherboard.\n   The  MIPS I ISA: The first version of the MIPS instruction set. Among many things, words are 32-bit long and the instruction set includes multiplication and division instructions.\n 32 general-purpose registers and  2 multiplication/division registers: These are 32-bit as well. One general-purpose register is always zero (R0), which is common in RISC processors.\n 32-bit data bus: In the PS1, the data bus forks into two buses. Sub Bus (16/8-bit) \u2192 Connects to the rest of the chips and I/O. This bus is bridged by the  Bus Interface Unit, which also enables access to special ports of the GPU and SPU.\n 32-bit address bus: Up to 4 GB of physical memory (i.e. RAM, memory-mapped I/O, etc) can be accessed.\n 5-stage pipeline: Up to five instructions can be executed simultaneously (a detailed explanation can be found in a  previous article).\n 4 KB instruction cache and  1 KB of data cache: The data cache also works as  Scratchpad (fast RAM), meaning that it can have other uses apart from behaving as L1 cache. Instruction cache can be \u2018isolated\u2019 instead, allowing the program to manipulate it directly.\n To do something meaningful, Sony provided  2 MB of RAM for general-purpose use. Curiously enough, they fitted  External Data Out (EDO) chips on the motherboard. These are slightly more efficient than typical DRAM, obtaining lower latency.\n  At some point, any subsystem (graphics, audio or CD) will require large chunks of data at a fast rate. However, the CPU will not always be able to keep up with the demand.\n For this reason, the CD-ROM Controller, MDEC, GPU, SPU and the Parallel port have access to an exclusive  DMA controller whenever they require it. DMA takes control of the main bus and performs a data transfer. The resulting rate is a lot faster than relying on the CPU, though the latter is still needed to set up a DMA transfer.\n Also, bear in mind that once DMA kicks in, the CPU can\u2019t access the main bus. This means the CPU will be idling unless it\u2019s got something in Scratchpad to keep it busy!\n  Like other MIPS R3000-based CPUs, the CW33000 supports configurations with up to four coprocessors, Sony customised it with three:\n Identified as \u2018CP0\u2019, the  System Control Coprocessor is a common block found on MIPS CPUs. In R3000-based systems, like this one, the CP0 controls how the cache is implemented. Thus, enabling direct access to data cache (in the form of \u2018Scratchpad\u2019) and instruction cache (with \u2018cache isolation\u2019). The control coprocessor is also responsible for handling interrupts, exceptions and breakpoints, the latter is useful during debugging.\n Wait, shouldn\u2019t co-processors only  expand CPU functions? Why is CP0 tightly coupled to the CPU?\n Indeed, R3000 cores depend on the system control coprocessor to be able to make use of many components, but whether this should be \u2018legal\u2019 or not comes down to the interpretation of the word \u2018co-processor\u2019. According to MIPS, a co-processor is not strictly an optional part of the CPU, it may also command the CPU\u2019s surroundings (cache, interrupts, etc). Hence, a co-processor can be an integral part of the system. This is just something to bear in mind while talking about MIPS-related systems.\n Later  R4000-based systems incorporated a Memory Management Unit (MMU) and a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) into this block, thereby increasing its capabilities and taking up  new roles.\n The \u2018CP2\u2019 or  Geometry Transformation Engine (GTE) is a special math processor that accelerates vector and matrix calculations.\n While only operating fixed-point types, it still provides useful operations for 3D graphics such as:\n Depth Cueing and colour value from a light source (used for lighting and colour operations).\n Z/depth average (I suspect this is for the \u2018ordering table\u2019, more details in the \u2018Graphics\u2019 section).\n You don\u2019t have to remember all these to follow the rest of the article! Just keep in mind that the GTE will be taking care of the first stages of the graphics pipeline, such as 3D projection, lighting and clipping. This will help to generate the required data that will be sent to the GPU for rendering.\n The  Motion Decoder, also called \u2018MDEC\u2019 or \u2018Macroblock Decoder\u2019, is another processor living next to the CPU. This time, it decompresses \u2018Macroblocks\u2019 into a format the GPU can understand. A Macroblock is a data structure that houses a picture with similar encoding to JPEG.\n The MDEC decompresses bitmaps made of 8x8 24 bpp pixels at a time. Walker\u2019s programming guide states the MDEC can compute 9,000 macroblocks per second. This would allow to stream a 320x240 px  full-motion video (FMV) at 30 frames per second.\n DMA is used to send compressed data through CD-ROM \u2192 RAM \u2192 MDEC. The same path is taken in the opposite direction, though in this case, the destination is VRAM.\n While this component is sitting inside the SoC and shares the same data bus, it\u2019s not a MIPS co-processor, so the CPU/DMA access it through the memory map (as opposed to intercepting instructions).\n For more info about the MDEC unit, I suggest checking out Sabin\u2019s and Czeka\u0144ski\u2019s resources (see \u2018Sources\u2019 section).\n  So far, we got a \u2018CP0\u2019 and a \u2018CP2\u2019, but  where\u2019s the \u2018CP1\u2019? Well, that\u2019s reserved for a  Floating Point Unit (FPU) and I\u2019m afraid Sony didn\u2019t provide one. This doesn\u2019t mean the CPU can\u2019t perform arithmetic with decimal numbers, it just won\u2019t be fast enough (software-emulated FPU) or too precise (fixed-point arithmetic instead).\n Game logic (involving physics, collision detection, etc) still can get around with fixed-point arithmetic. Fixed-point encoding stores decimal numbers with an immutable number of decimal places. This implies a loss in precision after certain operations, but remember, this is a video-game console, not a professional flight simulator. Hence, the precision-performance trade-off is somewhat feasible.\n By the way, sometimes I mix up \u2018fixed-point\u2019, \u2018floating-point\u2019, \u2018decimal\u2019 and \u2018integer\u2019 number types (hopefully not anymore!). If you feel the same, I recommend taking a look at Gabriel Ivancescu\u2019s quick summary (see the \u2018Sources\u2019 section) to quickly refresh those concepts.\n  As we\u2019ve seen before, the CW33300 is a pipelined processor, meaning that it queues up multiple instructions and executes them in parallel at different stages. This hugely improves instruction throughput, but if it\u2019s not controlled properly, it can lead to  pipeline hazards, resulting in computational errors.\n The MIPS I architecture is susceptible to  control hazards and  data hazards, which means that instructions may get executed when they shouldn\u2019t be; and that instructions may operate with outdated data before it\u2019s been updated.\n Any instruction followed by a \u2018branch\u2019 or \u2018jump\u2019 type opcode is executed unconditionally: Thus, developers have to manually fill the pipeline with modest instructions (such as \u2018calculate 0 plus 0\u2019) after the branch or jump to mitigate the hazard. These fillers are called  branch delay slots. Modern CPUs converted this phenomenon into an advantage:  Branch prediction. By adding extra circuitry to detect the hazard, the CPU discards the new computations if the branch/jump condition didn\u2019t meet. But if it did, then the CPU has saved some time.\n \u2018Load\u2019 instructions don\u2019t stall the pipeline until the data arrives: Slow external access like RAM, the CD reader or any other memory-mapped I/O can take a significant number of cycles to read. Hence, fillers are needed to keep the pipeline busy until the values arrive.\n As we can see from the example, some delay slots are filled with meaningful instructions, which perform computations that are not affected by the hazard. Hence, delay slots don\u2019t always imply a waste of cycles.\n In most cases, the compiler will automatically re-arrange instructions to fill in slots, or add useless fillers as a last measure. So, all in all, this phenomenon is a bit of a mixed bag.\n   To recap, a large part of the graphics pipeline is carried out by the GTE. This includes perspective transformation (which projects the 3D space onto a 2D plane using the camera\u2019s perspective) and lighting. The processed data is then sent to  Sony\u2019s proprietary GPU for rendering.\n  The system features  1 MB of VRAM that will be used to store the frame buffer, textures and other resources the GPU will require to render the scene. The CPU can fill this area using DMA.\n The type of chip fitted ( VRAM) is dual-ported, like the  Virtual Boy\u2019s. VRAM uses two 16-bit buses, which enables concurrent access between the CPU/DMA/GPU and the Video encoder.\n  Though in later revisions of this console, Sony switched to  SGRAM chips (the single-ported option using an individual 32-bit data bus).  Boo!&amp;mldr Well, to be fair, each one comes with its pros and cons. One thing for sure, is that due to the timing differences, later games (such as Jet Moto 3) will display glitched graphics when ran on VRAM-based systems. If you want to know the details, Martin Korth\u2019s \u2018Nocash PSX Specifications\u2019 document the different timings and such.\n  If you\u2019ve been reading the  Sega Saturn article, let me tell you that the design of this GPU  a lot simpler!\n Now, to show how a scene is drawn, I\u2019ll mainly use Insomniac\u2019s  Spyro: Year of the Dragon as an example. Please bear in mind that the internal resolution of this game is too cramped (292x217 px), preventing me to clearly dissect it at each stage, so I\u2019ve upscaled it a bit for demonstration purposes. Here is a sample at original scale if you are curious.\n To start with, the CPU sends geometry data (vertices) to the GPU by filling its internal 64 byte FIFO buffer with  commands (up to three). Essentially, a command states how and where to draw one primitive.\n Once the geometry is received,  clipping is applied to skip operations over unseen polygons (residing outside the camera\u2019s viewport).\n The location of the primitive is stated with an X/Y coordinate system pointing to the frame buffer. The PS1\u2019s GPU employs an  integer coordinate model, where each coordinate corresponds to the centre point of a pixel (called  sampling point). In other words, there are no fractional coordinates.\n Just like the  competition, the PS1 doesn\u2019t include any hardware feature that solves the  visibility problem. Nonetheless, the GPU handles sorted polygons by providing an  ordering table: A dedicated table where each entry is indexed using a depth value (also called \u2018Z-value\u2019) and contains the address where the GPU command resides.\n The CPU needs to manually sort the polygons first, and then reference them in the correct entry of the table. Finally, the CPU orders DMA to send the table to the GPU. This process will enable the GPU to render the geometry in the correct order.\n Multiple DMA functions are also provided to assist both CPU and GPU with the creation and traversal of this table.\n Once the commands are decoded by the GPU, it\u2019s time to convert the geometry received (vertices) into pixels. This will enable the system to apply texture mapping, effects and ultimately display it on a two-dimensional panel (your TV or monitor). To do this, the GPU allocates a pixel matrix that is used as a working area, this is called a  frame buffer. Compared to the more complex  Sega Saturn, the GPU only needs a single frame buffer.\n The GPU uses  triangles as primitives to form 3D models. Being the only available primitive means that backgrounds and foregrounds make no difference in terms of composition (both are made of triangles). 2D games inherit the same nature: They are just two triangles joined to form a quadrangle (though the GPU provides routines for constructing sprites automatically).\n The rasterizer is the unit in charge of converting vectors into triangles; and then into pixels. This is done by:\n Analysing the area of the triangle to identify which pixels of the frame buffer they occupy. Any section of the triangle covering the sampling point is turned into a pixel.\n The generated pixels are not written into the frame buffer right away. Instead, they are sent to the next stages of the pipeline for further processing, which we\u2019ll see in the following paragraphs.\n Gouraud shading: Each primitive\u2019s vertex embeds its own light level, then the brightness between each point is automatically interpolated. As you can imagine, the results are more realistic. On the other hand, this algorithm is not available for sprites.\n The reason for having this choice comes down to the fact that flat shading fills ~2.5 times more polygons per second than Gouraud, so it\u2019s important to optimise which polygons need a more realistic shading than others.\n The GPU performs  inverse texture mapping, where the GPU traverses each rasterized pixel and looks for its corresponding pixel in the texture map (called  texel). Texels are calculated by linearly interpolating the texture map (found in VRAM) to conform to the shape of the polygon. The routine used for interpolation is called  Affine Texture Mapping, this technique only operates using 2D coordinates (X/Y values) while discarding the third coordinate (Z/depth) used for perspective.\n Because texture maps rarely have the exact dimension of the rasterized polygon,  aliasing (incorrect results) may appear. This is manifested with unwanted distortions, such as missing or enlarged texels. To remedy this, sophisticated GPUs employ  texture filtering to smooth out (interpolate) sudden colour changes. Now, The PS1\u2019s GPU doesn\u2019t implement any filter, so it resorts to an algorithm named  nearest neighbour to correct scales without smoothing out the results. This is very fast (and cheap) but it also explains why textured models may look \u2018blocky\u2019.\n Once finished, the GPU writes the pixels into the frame buffer area in VRAM, which is in turn picked up by the video encoder and broadcasted to the screen.\n  Let\u2019s take a break now from all this theory. Here are some examples of game characters designed from the ground up for the 3D era, they are interactive so I encourage you to check them out!\n   With the available amount of VRAM (1  whole megabyte), one could allocate a  massive frame buffer of 1024\u00d7512 pixels with 16-bit colours or a  realistic one of 960\u00d7512 pixels with 24-bit colours - allowing to draw the best frames any game has ever shown&amp;mldr This sounds pretty impressive, right? Well, it does raise a couple of issues, for instance:\n Those dimensions will have to be rescaled to follow a standardised definition (i.e. 480 NTSC, 576 PAL) so the video encoder can broadcast it to consumer TVs.\n How is the GPU going to be able to draw anything decent if there isn\u2019t any space left for the rest of the materials (i.e. textures, colour tables, etc)?\n The PS1\u2019s GPU can only draw frame buffers with up to 640\u00d7480 pixels and 16 bpp colours.\n All right, so let\u2019s have a 16 bpp 640x480 buffer instead, which leaves 424 KB of VRAM for materials. So far so good? Again, such resolution may be fine on CRT monitors, but not particularly noticeable on those 90s TVs everyone had at their homes. Then, is there any way to optimise the frame-buffer? Introducing  adjustable frame-buffers.\n In essence, instead of wasting valuable VRAM by using \u2018unappreciated\u2019 resolutions, this console\u2019s GPU allows decreasing the dimensions of the frame buffer to effectively increment the space available for other resources. In \u2018Gears Episode 2\u2019 (see \u2018Sources\u2019 section), Halkun shows a setup that divides the 640x480 frame-buffer into two 320x480 ones, and then relies on a technique called  page-flipping to render multiple scenes at the same time.\n Page-flipping consists of switching the location of the frame for display between the two available whenever the game wants it, allowing the game to render one scene while displaying another. Thus, hiding any flickering effect and improving loading times (something that the player will certainly appreciate!).\n Overall, Halkun\u2019s layout only consumes 600 KB of VRAM. The rest (424 KB) can be used to store colour lookup tables and textures that, combined with  2 KB of texture cache available, results in a very convenient and efficient setup.\n Finally, it is worth mentioning that VRAM can be mapped using  multiple colour depths simultaneously, meaning that programmers can allocate a 16 bpp frame buffer next to 24 bpp bitmaps (used by FMV frames, for instance). This is another feature facilitating further optimisation of space.\n  Whereas the PS1 had a very simple and suitable architecture, problems ended up ari\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:41:25",

", "note_en": "A French start-up aims to run \u2018hotels on rails\u2019 from Paris to 12 cities across Europe, including Edinburgh, from 2024\n    Less than a decade after  Europe\u2019s night trains appeared to have reached the end of the line, a new French start-up has announced plans for a network of overnight services out of Paris from 2024.\n Midnight Trains is hoping post-Covid interest in cleaner, greener travel will generate interest in its proposed \u201chotels on rails\u201d, which aims to connect the French capital to 12 other European destinations, including Edinburgh.\n  The founders say the aim is not to match the famous \u2013 and expensive \u2013 luxury of the Orient Express but offer an alternative to the basic, state-run SNCF sleepers and short-haul flights.\n Key to the service will be \u201chotel-style\u201d rooms offering privacy and security, and an onboard restaurant and bar.\n Three years ago, Europe\u2019s night trains were being consigned to the economic sidings, driven out of business by low-cost flights and long-distance buses. Since then, however, public concerns over the climate emergency have led to a  surge of interest in reviving night routes across the continent.\n I noted that people around me don\u2019t want to get on a plane because of concerns about carbon emissions&#34;\n Eventually, Midnight Trains plans to serve at least a dozen destinations between 500 and 900 miles from  Paris, including cities in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Scotland.\n The final list will be confirmed after agreements have been reached over leasing either new or second-hand rolling stock and the use of rail networks in France and destination countries.\n The company is funded by French entrepreneurs, including the telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel, co-owner of Le Monde newspaper.\n Midnight Trains co-founder Adrien Aumont, also co-founder of the crowdfunding platform KissKissBankBank, says his interest in sleeper trains was kindled by both professional and personal reasons.\n \u201cI noted that people around me don\u2019t want to get on a plane because of concerns about carbon emissions, but also my girlfriend is afraid of flying and decided she was never getting on a plane. I realised the only way travel was going to be possible was by train,\u201d said Aumont.\n  \u201cAt the moment there is no alternative for medium-distance travel [other] than flights or a bad night train. And the only way we can rival planes is to reinvent the train experience.\n \u201cPeople want intimacy,\u201d said Aumont. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be sharing a sleeping space with a stranger. They want privacy, security and a good quality bed. By offering a bar and restaurant we are also offering conviviality and a certain  art de vivre.\n \u201cWhat we aim to do is to make people who want to travel in Europe hesitate to take the plane, to make a 90-minute flight a thing of the past.\u201d\n Aumont was reluctant to give ticket prices, but said these would be competitive with that of a short-haul flight, including what he called the \u201chidden costs\u201d.\n \u201cThis includes what you would have to pay for baggage and things like taxis to and from the airport,\u201d he said.\n Midnight Trains is the latest arrival in what is becoming a crowded market. Across Europe, state-run railways are facing new competition from private operators looking to introduce night trains. Fans of rail travel have waited some time for new night train routes to come along \u2026 only to find, a bit like buses, several turning up at the same time.\n The  Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy, published by the European Commission in December 2020, calls for a major shift in passengers to rail, including night trains.\n Since 2016, Austrian Federal Railways (\u00d6BB) has introduced six  new overnight routes under the Nightjet brand that was already operating nine night routes. Private operators in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Belgium have announced new overnight services.\n In December last year, \u00d6BB, the German rail company Deutsche Bahn, SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) announced the signing of an  agreement to launch new night train services in Europe. This is the first step in developing the  Trans-Europe Express (TEE) 2.0 network, proposed by the German presidency of the Council of the European Union. This partnership plans to launch four new services to 13 of Europe\u2019s largest cities in the coming years.\n In the  International Railway Journal, David Burroughs wrote: \u201cA return to the golden era of night trains in Europe is not going to be easy. But if operators are able to fully develop attractive services to meet the growing demands from passengers, while overcoming the major challenges they face, it could mark the start of a major new era in the post-pandemic world, and offer a major boon for the rail sector.\n Burroughs added: \u201cClimate change will not be solved overnight, but moving from plane to train is widely understood to play an important role in reducing transport emissions, and night trains could contribute to this change.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 19:40:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5367\u94fa,european,\u94c1\u8def", "title": "\u8ba1\u5212\u65b0\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u5367\u94fa\u5217\u8f66 ", "title_en": "New network of European sleeper trains planned", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/jun/22/new-network-of-european-sleeper-overnight-trains-planned", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5367\u94fa", "european", "\u94c1\u8def"]}]
