Few \u2014 very few, in fact \u2014 come out willing or even able to express complex ideas in ways appealing to non-academics. John Gray is one of those rare intellectuals.   \rProfessors tend to scoff at books written for more general audiences. Anything that becomes popular is taken as potentially not serious. But the truth is, most professors simply cannot write, talk, and perhaps even think in a manner which can engage non-academics. Having gone through years of rigorous, specialized training, scholars find it hard to communicate their insights to anyone outside their narrow fields. Gray does not.  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life is broadly appealing. Even more impressive, it has readers seriously consider radical ideas.   \rIt is difficult to speak about the myth of human progress, the navel-gazing silliness of autonomy and reason, the pompous attitude of the righteous, and the associated paradoxical nature of morality, accepting that neither love nor death are really such a big deal and \u2014 this is the real point of the book \u2014 the meaninglessness of the meaning of life. Gray does so without strong arguments, logical deductions, or other conventional philosophical tools. Big-name philosophers are referenced, but mostly on the back of novels about cats. Intertwining stories and facts about cats with philosophy, Gray invites serious reflection without telling readers how to reason or what to think.   \rThe 111-page book is broken into six chapters. In the first one, \u201cCats and Philosophy,\u201d Gray plainly states: \u201cThe nature of cats, and what we can learn from it, is the subject of this book.\u201d Here, and in the second chapter, \u201cWhy Cats Do Not Struggle to Be Happy,\u201d Gray presents philosophy as an effect of restlessness: it is born as an attempt to calm the anxiety of living in a chaotic and unpredictable world. Happiness then becomes a project for the future, when we do not feel un-at-ease. Unfortunately, striving with a clear plan in mind only makes things worse. \u201cOur lives are shaped by chance and our emotions by the body. Much of human life \u2014 and much of philosophy \u2014 is an attempt to divert ourselves from this fact.\u201d For cats, on the other hand, happiness just might be their natural condition.   \rIn the next chapter, Gray revisits one of his more unique positions. Discussing \u201cFeline Ethics,\u201d Gray reminds readers that moral values, standards, and any way of thinking about what is good or bad, are historically and regionally relative and contingent. This is true not just of cultures or societies, but of individuals as well. \u201cWhen people talk of morality they do not know what it is they are talking about. At the same time they are unshakably certain in what they say. This may seem paradoxical. But it is not, since what they are doing is expressing their emotions.\u201d Borrowing heavily from Spinoza, Daoism ( Daodejing/Tao Te Ching), and Zen Buddhism, Gray eloquently dances through attacks on morality, rationalism, agency, and the self.   \rChapter four provides a soothing respite from serious philosophical discussions. Here, \u201cHuman vs Feline Love\u201d is discussed largely by way of summarizing novels about cats. It is difficult to say exactly what, if any, specific point Gray is trying to make. And this is not meant as a criticism. Like many great thinkers, Gray is simply inviting readers to reflect and consider certain perspectives. Chapter five, on \u201cTime, Death and the Feline Soul,\u201d is written in a similar manner. The overarching idea here is simply that cats seem to \u201caccept life as a gift,\u201d while humans anxiously toil over every aspect of life and often get caught up in endless speculation about death.   \rIn the final chapter, \u201cCats and the Meaning of Life,\u201d Gray challenges that \u201cthe good life for each of us is not chosen but found.\u201d We are asked to consider the Daoist idea that \u201cwe must follow the way within us.\u201d Should we do that, our lives will be \u201cricher than any idea of perfection.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe good life is not a life you might have led or may yet lead, but the life you already have. Here, cats can be our teachers, for they do not miss the lives they have not lived.\u201d   \rGray eventually gives us \u201cTen Feline Hints on How to Live Well.\u201d They are concise and eloquent lessons we might learn from thinking about a \u201cfeline philosophy,\u201d or even from an honest reflection on life. The last sentence well summarizes the book in both content and style: \u201cThe meaning of life is a touch, a scent, which comes by chance and is gone before you know it.\u201d   \rReaders might be surprised that in the 10 lessons we never hear about \u201cplay.\u201d Upon further intellectual consideration, this becomes even more puzzling. The English intellectual is extremely fond of Daoism and Zen Buddhism; he titled his book  Straw Dogs (2002) after the fifth chapter of the  Daodejing. But the second cardinal Daoist text, and the major facilitator of the philosophical interchange between Daoism and Buddhism that produced Zen, the  Zhuangzi ( Chuang-Tzu), is conspicuously absent in  Feline Philosophy. This Daoist classic is not only full of jokes, conversations between animals, and advice from trees \u2014 it introduces \u201cplay\u201d as a philosophical approach and advocates it as a possible approach to life. Readers may seriously wonder why Gray did not talk about play in  Feline Philosophy, and what he thinks of the  Zhuangzi.   \rRelatedly, one great feline novel not mentioned in Gray\u2019s book is  I Am a Cat\u00a0by S\u014dseki Natsume (1867\u20131916). Natsume\u2019s story is playfully written from a cat\u2019s perspective. In more than a few places, the cat, or people around it, dives into prolonged digs against Western theories of progress, reason, and positivism \u2014 an obvious overlap with Gray\u2019s own predilections. More important than the philosophical digressions, however, is the playful element of  I Am a Cat. Unsurprisingly, much of  I Am a Cat, and Natsume\u2019s work in general, draws heavily on the  Zhuangzi.   \rSome reviewers of  Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life have summarized John Gray as advocating a coupling of feline indifference with Daoist contemplation. This assessment is more of a review of reviews than of the book itself. The real joy of  Feline Philosophy comes from the very experience of reading it. The book does not attempt to \u201cprove\u201d anything. Gray has survived the wringer and now expertly plays with his philosophical reflections. Like the  Daodejing, the Daoist classic Gray constantly references, readers miss the point if they search  Feline Philosophy for evaluative judgments, truths, or even arguments. The  Daodejing is (most likely) a record of sayings written, rewritten, edited, and reedited for centuries. For over two millennia, everyone from rulers, scholars, and Daoist priests to farmers and hermits read the text in a similar manner. They repeated the short sayings and reflected on their lives. What was useful from the  Daodejing they used, what wasn\u2019t they ignored. And that was that.   \rPerhaps we can, or even should, do something similar with our philosophical discussions today. Gray undoubtedly has his own philosophical perspective. But he has certainly learned from cats, and his reflections are honest and humble. In a world where hubris of all kinds fuels objectively difficult situations, it might not be a bad idea to be a little less black and white. Indeed, it might be even better if we added a bit of playfulness.       Paul J. D\u2019Ambrosio is associate professor of Chinese philosophy at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China.

", "note_en": "When the coronavirus shut down New York last spring, many residents came to rely on a colossal building they had never heard of: JFK8, Amazon\u2019s only fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city.\n What happened inside shows how Jeff Bezos created the workplace of the future and pulled off the impossible during the pandemic \u2014 but also reveals what\u2019s standing in the way of his promise to do better by his employees.\n Each year, hundreds of thousands of workers churn through a vast mechanism that hires and monitors, disciplines and fires. Amid the pandemic, the already strained system lurched.\n   Last September, Ann Castillo saw an email from Amazon that made no sense. Her husband had worked for the company for five years, most recently at the supersize warehouse on Staten Island that served as the retailer\u2019s critical pipeline to New York City. Now it wanted him back on the night shift.\n \u201cWe notified your manager and H.R. about your return to work on Oct. 1, 2020,\u201d the message said.\n Ms. Castillo was incredulous. While working mandatory overtime in the spring, her 42-year-old husband, Alberto, had been among the first wave of employees at the site to test positive for the coronavirus. Ravaged by fevers and infections, he suffered extensive brain damage. On tests of responsiveness, Ms. Castillo said, \u201chis score was almost nothing.\u201d\n  For months, Ms. Castillo, a polite, get-it-done physical therapist, had been alerting the company that her husband, who had been proud to work for the retail giant, was severely ill. The responses were disjointed and confusing. Emails and calls to Amazon\u2019s automated systems often dead-ended. The company\u2019s benefits were generous, but she had been left panicking as disability payments mysteriously halted. She managed to speak to several human resources workers, one of whom reinstated the payments, but after that, the dialogue mostly reverted to phone trees, auto-replies and voice mail messages on her husband\u2019s phone asking if he was coming back.\n The return-to-work summons deepened her suspicion that Amazon didn\u2019t fully register his situation. \u201cHaven\u2019t they kept track of what happened to him?\u201d she said. She wanted to ask the company: \u201cAre your workers disposable? Can you just replace them?\u201d\n Mr. Castillo\u2019s workplace, the only Amazon fulfillment center in America\u2019s largest city, was achieving the impossible during the pandemic. With New York\u2019s classic industries suffering mass collapse, the warehouse, called JFK8, absorbed hotel workers, actors, bartenders and dancers, paying nearly $18 an hour. Driven by a new sense of mission to serve customers afraid to shop in person, JFK8 helped Amazon smash shipping records, reach stratospheric sales and book the equivalent of the previous three years\u2019 profits rolled into one.\n That success, speed and agility were possible because Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos, had pioneered new ways of mass-managing people through technology, relying on a maze of systems that minimized human contact to grow unconstrained.\n But the company was faltering in ways outsiders could not see, according to a New York Times examination of JFK8 over the last year.\n In contrast to its precise, sophisticated processing of packages, Amazon\u2019s model for managing people \u2014 heavily reliant on metrics, apps and chatbots \u2014 was uneven and strained even before the coronavirus arrived, with employees often having to act as their own caseworkers, interviews and records show. Amid the pandemic, Amazon\u2019s system burned through workers, resulted in inadvertent firings and stalled benefits, and impeded communication, casting a shadow over a business success story for the ages.\n Amazon took steps unprecedented at the company to offer leniency, but then at times contradicted or ended them. Workers like Mr. Castillo at JFK8 were told to take as much unpaid time off as they needed, then hit with mandatory overtime. When Amazon offered employees flexible personal leaves, the system handling them jammed, issuing a blizzard of job-abandonment notices to workers and sending staff scrambling to save them, according to human resources and warehouse employees.\n  After absences initially soared and disrupted shipping, Amazon left employees mostly in the dark about the toll of the virus. The company did not tell workers at JFK8 or other warehouses the number of cases, causing them to worry whether notifications about \u201cindividuals\u201d testing positive meant two or 22. While Amazon said publicly that it was disclosing confirmed cases to health officials, New York City records show no reported cases until November. The company and city officials dispute what happened.\n Amazon continued to track every minute of most warehouse workers\u2019 shifts, from how fast they packed merchandise to how long they paused \u2014 the kind of monitoring that  spurred a failed unionization drive led by frustrated Black employees at an Alabama warehouse this spring. If productivity flagged, Amazon\u2019s computers assumed the worker was to blame. Early in the pandemic, the online retailer paused its firing of employees for low output, but that change was not announced clearly at JFK8, so some workers still feared that moving too slowly would cost them their livelihoods.\n \u201cIt is very important that area managers understand that associates are more than just numbers,\u201d an employee wrote on JFK8\u2019s internal feedback board last fall, adding: \u201cWe are human beings. We are not tools used to make their daily/weekly goals and rates.\u201d\n The company touted breathtaking job-creation numbers: From July to October 2020 alone, it scooped up 350,000 new workers, more than the population of St. Louis. Many recruits \u2014 hired through a computer screening, with little conversation or vetting \u2014 lasted just days or weeks.\n Even before the pandemic, previously unreported data shows, Amazon lost about 3 percent of its hourly associates each week, meaning the turnover among its work force was roughly 150 percent a year. That rate,  almost double that of the retail and logistics industries, has made some executives worry about running out of workers across America.\n In documenting the untold story of how the pandemic exposed the power and peril of Amazon\u2019s employment system, reporters interviewed nearly 200 current and former employees, from new hires at the JFK8 bus stop to back-office workers overseas to managers on Staten Island and in Seattle. The Times also reviewed company documents, legal filings and government records, as well as posts from warehouse feedback boards that served as a real-time ticker of worker concerns.\n  This April, Mr. Bezos said he was proud of the company\u2019s work culture, the \u201cachievable\u201d productivity goals, the pay and benefits. In interviews, the head of human resources for warehouses and the general manager of JFK8 said that the company prioritized employee welfare, noted that it had expanded its H.R. staff and cited internal surveys showing high worker satisfaction. Some managers from JFK8 and beyond described building deep relationships with their teams.\n Amazon acknowledged some issues with inadvertent firings, loss of benefits, job abandonment notices and leaves, but declined to disclose how many people were affected. Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman, suggested that those problems and some others chronicled in this article were outliers.\n Ofori Agboka, the H.R. leader, noted that social distancing and masking had made it harder to engage employees in personal ways during the pandemic. Still, he said, \u201c98 percent of everything\u2019s going great \u2014 people are having the right experiences,\u201d getting the help they need when they want it.\n But several former executives who helped design Amazon\u2019s systems, and still call themselves admirers of the company, said the high turnover, pressure over productivity and consequences of scaling up have become too critical to ignore. The company has not ambitiously addressed those issues, said Paul Stroup, who until recently led corporate teams devoted to understanding warehouse workers.\n \u201cAmazon can solve pretty much any problem it puts its mind behind,\u201d he said in an interview. The human resources division, though, had nowhere near the focus, rigor and investment of Amazon\u2019s logistical operations, where he had previously worked. \u201cIt felt like I was in a different company,\u201d he said.\n David Niekerk, a former Amazon vice president who built the warehouse human resources operations, said that some problems stemmed from ideas the company had developed when it was much smaller. Mr. Bezos did not want an entrenched work force, calling it \u201ca march to mediocrity,\u201d Mr. Niekerk recalled, and saw low-skilled jobs as relatively short-term. As Amazon rapidly grew, Mr. Niekerk said, its policies were harder to implement with fairness and care. \u201cIt is just a numbers game in many ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe culture gets lost.\u201d\n  Even Mr. Bezos, in his final lap as chief executive of the company he created, is now making startling concessions about the system he invented. In a recent letter to shareholders, he said the union effort showed that \u201cwe need a better vision for how we create value for employees \u2014 a vision for their success.\u201d\n \u201cWe have always wanted to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u201d he wrote. Now, he added, \u201cwe are going to be Earth\u2019s best employer and Earth\u2019s  safest place to work.\u201d\n Amazon is also  on pace to become the nation\u2019s largest private employer within a year or two, as it continues expanding. About a million people in the United States, most of them hourly workers, now rely on the company\u2019s wages and benefits. Many describe the job as rewarding. Adama Ndoye had supported her family on her JFK8 pay while attending college remotely. \u201cLights on, food, clothes, everything,\u201d she said. Dawn George, a chef, said she was grateful to JFK8 for taking her in after hotel kitchen jobs disappeared last spring. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work my socks off just for an hourly income,\u201d she said.\n Some admire Amazon\u2019s ambition. \u201cIt was like being a pitcher on a team that had a game every night,\u201d said Dan Cavagnaro, who started at JFK8 when it opened in 2018 and worked with Mr. Castillo.\n  But Mr. Cavagnaro was mistakenly fired in July while trying to return from leave, and could not reach anyone to help.\n \u201cPlease note the following,\u201d he wrote in his final, unanswered email plea. \u201cI WISH TO REMAIN EMPLOYED WITH AMAZON.\u201d\n   In late March 2020, Traci Weishalla walked the length of JFK8, forgoing the fluorescent vest that marked her as a manager. She wanted an unfiltered look at what she would soon be helping to oversee: a warehouse the size of 15 football fields, serving America\u2019s largest metropolis just as it was becoming the national epicenter of the pandemic.\n The noise, from conveyor belts whipping around packages, was like the roar of an oncoming subway train. Built to conquer the most lucrative market in the country, the facility ran almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n Ms. Weishalla had helped open the warehouse a year and a half earlier, and now \u2014 as homebound customers across the nation  clamored for thermometers, disinfectant and puzzles \u2014 she saw opportunity and purpose in her return as assistant general manager. For an organization that dealt in logistical miracles, the coronavirus was just another obstacle to overcome, she said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Ms. Weishalla, 38, explained later. \u201cWe work to figure out the impossible problems.\u201d\n  But Amazon\u2019s mighty system was lurching. Semi trucks sat at warehouses around the country, without enough workers to unload them. Customers discovered that items the company had deemed nonessential might take a month to arrive \u2014 an eternity for a business that had routinely delivered within two days.\n   To lure them back, Amazon offered a temporary $2-an-hour raise, double pay for overtime and, for the first time, unlimited unpaid time off. Executives thought that workers should be able to stay home without fear of being fired, and that with greater flexibility, some might still come in for part of a shift, according to two people familiar with the decision. (Like some other senior leaders in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.)\n  Across the country, almost a third of Amazon\u2019s 500,000 workers were staying home. Some new hires abandoned jobs before they even began, according to former recruiters. JFK8 \u201cwas like a ghost town,\u201d recalled Arthur Turner, a worker who remained.\n Even Alberto Castillo considered staying home. The numbers on the news were unfathomable: at least 20,000 New Yorkers already infected, city hospitals jammed, as many as 1.7 million deaths projected nationwide.\n But this was no time to go without his income: The Castillos, immigrants from the Philippines, yearned to buy a house. He worked nights, troubleshooting and training with gentle mastery, frequent jokes and \u201cStar Wars\u201d references, colleagues said, and he had just applied for a promotion.\n JFK8 was also giving contradictory instructions: Despite Amazon\u2019s promise of unpaid time off, workers were alerted that every department would be on mandatory overtime.\n When Mr. Castillo arrived on March 24, he heard the warehouse had its first positive case. He messaged his boss, who replied, \u201cYes, forgot to bring that up,\u201d and added that everyone who worked with the employee had been notified. Mr. Castillo called his wife to discuss whether to head home. They decided he would finish out his shift.\n    That morning, two workers drove in the opposite direction, beelined to JFK8\u2019s break room and told dozens of colleagues: The virus had breached the warehouse, Amazon could not be trusted to tell them the truth and the facility should be shut down.\n Derrick Palmer and Chris Smalls, Amazon teammates and best friends, weren\u2019t part of any formal effort. Their employer considered unionization a dire threat, and had even backed out of building a second headquarters in New York  in part over potential labor-organizing plans. A  retail workers\u2019 union had once boldly declared that JFK8 would become the first unionized Amazon warehouse in the country, but the effort had died.\n Both men had been at Amazon since 2015 and knew the company from the lowest rungs. Mr. Palmer, then 31, was observant and deliberate, so fit that he often headed to the gym after a 10-hour shift. After dropping out of community college, he worked in a string of warehouses, joined Amazon and was now a \u201cpicker\u201d at JFK8, pulling products off robotic shelves. He often produced top numbers on the software that tracked productivity, and had been selected to train others and help open a warehouse in Illinois.\n He also felt let down, believing that Amazon\u2019s towering success didn\u2019t accrue to workers like him. Employees felt managed largely by app, algorithm and strict but poorly explained rules, he said. When he met Ms. Weishalla at a 2019 session for workers to share feedback, he said, he requested more human interaction from management and told her he aspired to a job like hers. But he saw no changes. \u201cIf we go beyond the requirements, there\u2019s no reward,\u201d he said in an interview.\n  When Mr. Palmer last sought a promotion, in early 2020, he was among 382 people who applied for the position. Though he didn\u2019t know it, the odds were steep by design, an outgrowth of Mr. Bezos\u2019 management philosophies.\n Amazon intentionally limited upward mobility for hourly workers, said Mr. Niekerk, the former H.R. vice president who retired in 2016 after nearly 17 years at the company. Dave Clark, then head of operations, had shot down his proposal around 2014 to create more leadership roles for hourly employees, similar to noncommissioned officers in the military, he recalled.\n Instead, Mr. Clark, who is now chief executive of Amazon\u2019s consumer business, wanted to double down on hiring \u201cwicked smart\u201d frontline managers straight out of college, Mr. Niekerk said. By contrast, more than 75 percent of managers in Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores started as hourly employees. Following a pattern across Amazon, JFK8 promoted 220 people last year among its more than 5,000 employees, a rate that is less than half of Walmart\u2019s.\n Amazon\u2019s founder didn\u2019t want hourly workers to stick around for long, viewing \u201ca large, disgruntled\u201d work force as a threat, Mr. Niekerk recalled. Company data showed that most employees became less eager over time, he said, and Mr. Bezos believed that people were inherently lazy. \u201cWhat he would say is that our nature as humans is to expend as little energy as possible to get what we want or need.\u201d That conviction was  embedded throughout the business, from the ease of instant ordering to the pervasive use of data to get the most out of employees.\n So guaranteed wage increases stopped after three years, and Amazon provided incentives for low-skilled employees to leave. Every year, Mr. Palmer saw signs go up offering associates thousands of dollars to resign, and as he entered JFK8 each morning, he passed a classroom for free courses to train them in other fields.\n Mr. Agboka, the H.R. leader, said while the company offered training and careers at Amazon to those interested, it was proud to also provide people short-term employment for the \u201cseasons and periods of time\u201d they need.\n  As the virus arrived at JFK8, Mr. Palmer worried about how Amazon would protect and communicate with workers. Notification about the warehouse\u2019s first positive case had been uneven. A colleague working near Mr. Smalls had appeared sick, her eyes bloodshot as she struggled through her shift.\n The two men saw only one solution: for JFK8 to pause, clean and reassess, as an Amazon facility in Queens had briefly done. Unpaid leave wasn\u2019t enough, they said \u2014 a company run by the richest man on earth shouldn\u2019t force workers to choose between safety and a paycheck.\n    \u201cAre you guys actually just picking essential items?\u201d one asked, referring to Amazon\u2019s early-pandemic efforts to ship only necessary merchandise.\n  Nearly all the workers in the group were Black, like Mr. Palmer and Mr. Smalls, or Latino. So were more than 60 percent of associates at JFK8, according to internal Amazon records from 2019. Management, the documents show, was more than 70 percent white or Asian. Black associates at JFK8 were almost 50 percent more likely to be fired \u2014 whether for productivity, misconduct, or not showing up for work \u2014 than their white peers, the records show. (Amazon said it could not confirm the data without knowing more specifics about its source.)\n Source: Amazon&#39;s 2018 report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u00b7 Note: Bar heights are scaled by the total number of employees in each category. \u201cOthers\u201d includes Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and employees belonging to two or more groups.\n Between the constant monitoring, the assumption that many workers are slackers, and the lack of advancement opportunity, \u201ca lot of minority workers just felt like we were being used,\u201d Mr. Palmer said later.\n \u201cWe\u2019re the heart and soul of that building,\u201d he wrote in the chat. \u201cNothing gets done without us.\u201d\n The two men continued their break-room warnings for several more days, and confronted JFK8 managers. \u201cIf, God forbid, somebody in this building passes away, or somebody\u2019s loved one passes away, that\u2019s going to be on your hands, not mine,\u201d Mr. Smalls, the firecracker of the pair, told the warehouse\u2019s top leader, according to an audio recording of one conversation.\n On March 30, they demonstrated in the parking lot with a small group of other employees. Mr. Palmer carried a sign that read, \u201cTreat your workers like your customers.\u201d\n In Seattle, executives still grappling with cratering attendance sought to minimize the protest but instead drew more  attention to it. Amazon fired Mr. Smalls, saying his demonstration had violated a quarantine order based on his contact with the sick co-worker.

The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers\u2019 data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information.\u201d\n Western Digital\u2019s  brief advisory includes  a link to an entry in the National Vulnerability Database for CVE-2018-18472. The NVD writeup says Western Digital WD My Book Live and WD My Book Live Duo (all versions) have a root Remote Command Execution bug.\n \u201cIt can be triggered by anyone who knows the IP address of the affected device, as exploited in the wild in June 2021 for factory reset commands,\u201d NVD wrote.\n Examine the CVE attached to this flaw and you\u2019ll notice it was issued in 2018. The  NVD\u2019s advisory credits VPN reviewer  Wizcase.com with reporting the bug to Western Digital three years ago, back in June 2018.\n In some ways, it\u2019s remarkable that it took this long for vulnerable MyBook devices to be attacked: The 2018 Wizcase writeup on the flaw includes proof-of-concept code that lets anyone run commands on the devices as the all-powerful \u201croot\u201d user.\n Western Digital\u2019s response at the time was that the affected devices were no longer supported and that customers should avoid connecting them to the Internet. That response also suggested this bug has been present in its devices for at least a decade.\n \u201cThe vulnerability report CVE-2018-18472 affects My Book Live devices originally introduced to the market between 2010 and 2012,\u201d reads a reply from Western Digital that Wizcase  posted to its blog. \u201cThese products have been discontinued since 2014 and are no longer covered under our device software support lifecycle. We encourage users who wish to continue operating these legacy products to configure their firewall to prevent remote access to these devices, and to take measures to ensure that only trusted devices on the local network have access to the device.\u201d\n  Wizcase said the flaw it found in MyBook devices also may be present in certain models of  WD MyCloud network attached storage (NAS) devices, although Western Digital\u2019s advisory makes no mention of its MyCloud line being affected.\n The vulnerable MyBook devices are popular among home users and small businesses because they\u2019re relatively feature-rich and inexpensive, and can be upgraded with additional storage quite easily. But these products also make it simple for users to access their files remotely over the Internet using a mobile app.\n I\u2019m guessing it is primarily users who\u2019ve configured their MyBooks to be remotely accessible who are experiencing these unfortunate drive wipes. Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from ethernet access.\n If you\u2019d still like to keep your MyBook connected to your local network (at least until you can find a suitable backup for your backups), please make double sure remote access is not enabled in your device settings (see screenshot above).\n       \u201cNo longer supported\u201d shouldn\u2019t mean \u201cSay goodbye to your data!\u2019\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Top hints: \u201cdefault password \u2018admin,\u2019 \u201d followed by \u201cfinal firmware update in 2015,\u201d and \u201cCVE-2018\u2026\u201d It\u2019s almost as though individuals are copying the cybersecurity practices of corporations!\n    I\u2019m not so sure\u2026WD did state that the device should not be connected to the Internet (but probably not in anything sent to people they knew had bought the device). The vulnerability was identified 3 years after they stopped producing it, and at this point it has been 6 years since the last one was produced.\n I\u2019m with Brian\u2026the surprising thing is that it took three years after the vulnerability with POC was exploited (at least on any scale).\n  There will always be a limit on how long manufacturers support their products. The more you pay the more support you can (or should) expect, but sooner or later it will end. And these customers can jump to any cheap as chips product from another manufacturer, yet the rules will be the same. Sorry for life being so hard on you.\n  Not victim shaming, but what the heck are you doing exposing a personal hard drive to the web in the first place?\n  I\u2019m a tech from way back and I also have external hard drives plugged up to my computer, two of them WD brand, but I never made use of the online cloud service provided by WD. In the world before cloud computing was available, I copied everything to two separate hard drives and then handed one to my father and another one to my grandmother and they stored them in the back of some closets in their own homes for years. My logic at the time was this: if there\u2019s ever a fire or some other kind of disaster, at least my data is safe in two different backup locations.\n  The first paragraph\u2019s use of \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d is either confusing (there\u2019s a 3-year old CVE and POC) or tautological (everything we know is \u201cpreviously unknown\u201d). Admittedly a nit, but one an article skimmer might think excuses WD somewhat.\n  &gt; Regardless, it\u2019s probably safest to observe Western Digital\u2019s advice and disconnect any MyBooks you have from **ethernet** access.\n Was this supposed to be **internet** access? Not nitpicking here, just wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think \u201coh it\u2019s ok mine\u2019s on WiFi not Ethernet\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:59:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "Researchers have dropped a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit on Twitter for a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA). The move comes as reports surface of in-the-wild exploitation of the bug.\n Researchers at Positive Technologies published the PoC for the bug (CVE-2020-3580) on Thursday. One of the researchers there, Mikhail Klyuchnikov, noted that there were a heap of researchers now chasing after an exploit for the bug, which he termed \u201clow-hanging\u201d fruit.\n   The hunt for low hanging CVE-2020-3580 by  @ptswarm has begun. A lot of submissions/duplicates are waiting for  @Bugcrowd and  @Hacker0x01  #bugbounty\n  Meanwhile, Tenable researchers published an alert about the PoC, noting that it has started to see cyberattacks using the vulnerability on targets in the wild.\n \u201cTenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild,\u201d according to its  Thursday alert. \u201cWith this new information, Tenable recommends that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580.\u201d\n And indeed, the PT PoC tweet was met with plenty of \u201cOoh thanks\u201d and \u201cthank you so much\u201d responses, presumably from would-be hackers.\n   Meanwhile, researchers at WebSec noted that the bug could be exploited for more than XSS:\n You could have gotten 2 CVE numbers for this, as this is not just XSS but also CSRF.\n  \u201cResearchers often develop PoCs before reporting a vulnerability to a developer and publishing them allows other researchers to both check their work and potentially dig further and discover other issues,\u201d Claire Tills, senior research engineer at Tenable, told Threatpost. \u201cPoCs can also be used by defenders to develop detections for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, giving that valuable information to defenders means it can also end up in the hands of attackers.\u201d\n Given that a patch has been available for this vulnerability for several months, organizations are able to protect themselves which isn\u2019t the case with 0-day disclosures, she pointed out. \u201cHowever, unpatched vulnerabilities continue to haunt many organizations,\u201d Tillis added. \u201cThe public availability of a PoC is another stark reminder that effective patching is a vital step for organizations to protect themselves.\u201d\n  The Cisco ASA is a  cybersecurity perimeter-defense appliance that combines firewall, antivirus, intrusion prevention and virtual private network (VPN) capabilities, all meant to stop threats from making it onto corporate networks. A compromise of the device is akin to unlocking the front door of the castle for storming cyberattackers.\n XSS attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites; any visitors to the compromised websites are thus subject to drive-by attacks.\n Successful exploitation in this case means that unauthenticated, remote attackers could \u201cexecute arbitrary code within the [ASA] interface and access sensitive, browser-based information,\u201d Tenable added.\n Once in, they could modify the device\u2019s configuration, according to Leo Pate, an application security consultant at nVisium.\n However, the target would need to be logged into the ASA for the attackers to see any joy. \u201cWhile this sounds dangerous, exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrative user to login and navigate to the webpage where the attacker uploaded the malicious code,\u201d he added.\n As Tenable researchers said: \u201cAn attacker would need to convince \u2018a user of the interface\u2019 to click on a specially crafted link.\u201d This can be accomplished via a spear-phishing email campaign targeting probable ASA users using malicious links, or via watering-hole attacks.\n \u201cThe attack vector to get this in the hands of the right people is complex requiring a firewall administrator to be duped into clicking a cleverly crafted link,\u201d Andrew Barratt, managing principal for solutions and investigations at Coalfire, told Threatpost. \u201cFirewall administrators will need to ensure they\u2019re not accessing links to the ASA interface that appear to originate from outside.\u201d\n  Thanks to the sheer size of its footprint (including inside Fortune 500 companies), the Cisco ASA is no stranger to attention from cyberattackers. Last year for example, public PoC for another bug in the device ( CVE-2020-3452) started making the rounds, leading to a  spate of exploitation efforts.\n  The flaw tracked as CVE-2020-3580  was patched on October 21 as part of a group of XSS issues in Cisco\u2019s ASA as well as the Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software, which is a unified firewall image that includes ASA management.\n \u201cAll four vulnerabilities exist because Cisco ASA and FTD software web services do not sufficiently validate user-supplied inputs,\u201d according to the advisory, which noted that the bug in question rates 6.1 out of 10 on the CVSSv3 vulnerability-severity scale.\n The number of vulnerable devices could be significant:  Researchers with Rapid7 last year found there to be 85,000 internet-accessible ASA devices. Of course, a good percentage of those could be patched against this particular vulnerability.\n \u201cExploits for appliances that may sit on the vanishing perimeter generally garner interest [from hackers], but fortunately in this case there are at least two things working against rampant exploitation,\u201d Tim Wade, technical director for the CTO team at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cFirst, a patch has been available since October. Second, an element of social engineering is required. This should provide some level of confidence for organizations with reasonable patch cycles and a security awareness program.\u201d\n Updating to the latest versions of the affected devices\u2019 software is of course recommended; however, there\u2019s more that can be done to mitigate the vulnerability, nVisium\u2019s Pate noted.\n \u201cOrganizations can ask their internal teams if they need to use the web management interface, and if so, is it available to everyone on the internet or just internally to our organization? If the web management interface isn\u2019t needed, then it should be disabled,\u201d he told Threatpost.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0  Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET \u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

\u201cThot Shit,\u201d some Black TikTok creators began  calling attention to that exploitation this week, inspiring others to  refuse to choreograph a dance to the hit song. The idea behind the movement is that Black artists on the platform create a disproportionate amount of content and culture \u2014 much of which is  re-packaged and monetized by popular white creators and culture at large.\n The song choice probably isn\u2019t a coincidence. The Megan Thee Stallion video is both a playful but important paean to essential workers \u2014 twerking grocery, food service and sanitation workers, in this case \u2014 and a biting commentary on the wealthy white establishment that exploits their labor without thinking twice.\n   The \u201cstrike\u201d doesn\u2019t have creators leaving the platform or even staying off of the app. Instead, Black creators who might normally contribute dances for the hot new song are sitting back and  pointing to what happens when they\u2019re not around. (Predictably: not a lot.)\n On the sound\u2019s page, some videos tease choreography but pivot into a statement about how  Black creators don\u2019t get their due on the app. In other videos, Black creators watch on in horror at awkward dance attempts failing to fill the void or laugh about how the song\u2019s lyrics are instructional but  non-Black TikTok still can\u2019t figure it out. The eminently danceable \u201cThot shit\u201d could build into Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s biggest hit yet, but just looking on TikTok you wouldn\u2019t know it.\n  When reached for comment on the phenomenon, TikTok praised Black creators as a \u201ccritical and vibrant\u201d part of the community. \u201cWe care deeply about the experience of Black creators on our platform and we continue to work every day to create a supportive environment for our community while also instilling a culture where honoring and crediting creators for their creative contributions is the norm,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said.\n Many TikTok accounts participating in the strike  cite a recent explosion of white TikTokkers lip-syncing obliviously to a clip of Nicki Minaj\u2019s 2016 song \u201cBlack Barbies\u201d that  specifically praises Black bodies (\u201cI\u2019m a fucking Black Barbie/Pretty face, perfect body\u2026\u201d). White TikTok inexplicably flocked to the sound, boosting its popularity and crowding out Black creators. It\u2019s just one incident in a long history of Black creators feeling exploited and appropriated on social networks. Black TikTok dancers have long been left in the cold: Their original dance moves explode in popularity and get picked up by non-Black creators, who also pick up the credit along the way.\n The TikTok strike truly is amazing b/c it shows not only how US pop culture is built on stealing from Black people, but how the music industry depends on this cycle of theft &amp; white washing in order to monetize the music.\n The recent strike is the latest beat in the ongoing conversation over who gets to cash in on the wellspring of creativity that pours out of a platform like TikTok. More broadly, some creators believe that  TikTok\u2019s economics are stacked against them, even compared to other major platforms like YouTube. Across social media sites, creators,  particularly creators of color, are turning to collective action and  even unionizing to assert their power.\n For Black creators tired of seeing their work appropriated, collectively refusing to gift the world a hot new TikTok dance is certainly one way to show just how vital they are to the online ecosystem \u2014 something even a quick glance at the desolate \u201cThot Shit\u201d sound makes abundantly clear.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:22:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u9ed1\u8272,black,tiktok", "title": "\u5728Tiktok\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u7f62\u5de5\u547c\u5524\u7740\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u53d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tOn TikTok, Black creators\u2019 dance strike calls out creative exploitation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/tiktok-strike-black-creators-thot-megan-thee-stallion/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u9ed1\u8272", "black", "tiktok"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dec31a285a19f7aa41b8b675fc3bbdad.jpg", "infoid": 1068348, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel de Icaza\u7684\u7740\u540d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel De Icaza\u5728\u63a8\u7279\u4e0a\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Android Apks\u3002\n \u5fae\u8f6f\u6628\u5929\u900f\u9732\uff0cWindows 11\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Amazon App Store\u901a\u8fc7Microsoft Store\u652f\u6301Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u5b89\u88c5\u81ea\u5df1\u7684APK\u3002\n \u5b83\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n  \u6628\u5929\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba3\u5e03Windows 11\u5c06\u652f\u6301\u6bcd\u8bedAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5168\u90e8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Microsoft Store\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728PC\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5b89\u88c5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210Amazon App Store\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid Apks\uff1f Sideloading\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4eceMicrosoft Store\u5916\u90e8\u5b89\u88c5Android\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e93\u3002\n \u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u201c\u662f\u201d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6839\u636e\u7740\u540d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08Miguel de Icaza\u3002 Miguel\u8d1f\u8d23\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5305\u62ecGNOME\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728Microsoft\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684Twitter Bio\u660e\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\u201c\u5728\u5fae\u8f6f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u8bdd\u201d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u4e9b\u6000\u7591\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u7c73\u683c\u5c14\u7684\u8840\u7edf\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6d88\u606f\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u3002 \n\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695aWindows 11\u4e0a\u7684\u4fa7\u9762\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid APKS\u5c06\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 \u60a8\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4e0b\u8f7dAPK\uff0c\u6309\u7167EXE\uff0c\u53cc\u51fb\u5b83\uff0c\u5e76\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\uff1f \u6216\u8005\u4f1a\u6709\u67d0\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u8bae\u5417\uff1f \u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u7b49\u5f85\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u3002  \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9Windows 11\u767b\u9646\u6b64\u79cb\u5929\u66f4\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\uff01 ", "note_en": "Famed software engineer Miguel de Icaza confirmed on Twitter that you will be able to sideload Android APKs in Windows 11.\n Microsoft revealed yesterday that Windows 11 will support Android apps through the Microsoft Store via the Amazon App Store. But it seems you\u2019ll be able to install your own APKs from anywhere.\n It isn\u2019t clear exactly how this will all work yet, but this is certainly exciting news.\n  Yesterday, Microsoft surprised us all by announcing that  Windows 11 will support native Android app installation. Using the Microsoft Store, you\u2019ll be able to search for, install, and use Android apps right on your PC. This is possible through an integration of the Amazon App Store.\n However, a big question loomed over the announcement: would you be able to sideload Android APKs on Windows 11? Sideloading apps would allow you to install Android programs from outside the Microsoft Store, which would give you a much larger potential library.\n It seems the answer to that question is \u201cyes,\u201d at least according to famed engineer  Miguel de Icaza. Miguel is responsible for numerous software projects, including GNOME, and currently works at Microsoft. However, his Twitter bio explicitly says \u201cWorking at Microsoft, not speaking for them,\u201d so we need to take this news with some skepticism.\n Still, Miguel\u2019s pedigree in the software space is very high, so it\u2019s likely he\u2019s correct on this news.\n Of course, it\u2019s not quite clear how sideloading Android APKs on Windows 11 will work. Will you be able to simply download an APK as you would an EXE, double-click it, and install it? Or will there be some sort of workaround protocol? We\u2019ll need to wait to see how this develops.\n In the meantime, though, you can get even more excited about Windows 11 landing this Fall!", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:16:06", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "According to an engineer at Microsoft, Windows 11 users will have the ability to sideload Android apps onto the operating system, which looks like an answer to one of the biggest questions we had when Microsoft announced it was  bringing Android apps to Windows 11 via the Amazon Appstore ( via  Android Police). This means that once Windows 11 launches, you won\u2019t just have to stick to the apps that Amazon makes available, but it does raise some new questions about how running Android apps on Windows will work.\n For example, it\u2019s unclear what the process for running or installing a sideloaded app will be. Chrome OS technically has the ability to run sideloaded apps, too, but  the process isn\u2019t exactly easy, as it involves enabling Linux and doing some command line work. We asked Microsoft for details about what running Android apps from outside the Amazon Appstore would be like, but we haven\u2019t gotten a response.\n  It\u2019s possible that the desire for sideloading apps onto Windows wouldn\u2019t be as strong had Microsoft included Google\u2019s Play Store instead of Amazon\u2019s Appstore. While having any app store will obviously grant Windows users access to many programs that they couldn\u2019t previously run on their computers, Amazon\u2019s  has some notable omissions from its catalog. If a Windows user wanted to run the Android version of Snapchat or Apple Music, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get them from Amazon.\n While sideloading apps helps solve this problem, it does raise concerns of its own. The first is the question of where users will obtain those apps: while there aren\u2019t likely to be piracy concerns with free apps like Snapchat, the ability to load an APK could allow people to get paid apps for free from less-than-legal repositories.\n There\u2019s also the question of safety and whether Windows will have the ability to scan sideloaded apps for potentially malicious behavior, a feature that Google builds into Android already.\n While it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s still a lot that Microsoft hasn\u2019t covered about what running Android apps on Windows 11\u2019s will actually be like (though  the technical details it\u2019s revealed are fascinating), it\u2019s still good to  have confirmation from someone at Microsoft that the selection of Android apps won\u2019t just be limited to what\u2019s on Amazon\u2019s Appstore.\n Hopefully Microsoft will start sharing more details on exactly how Android apps will work soon so it can get feedback from both Windows users and Android developers before the feature becomes available for everyone, likely later this year.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 07:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,android,microsoft,\u7a0b\u5e8f,engineer", "title": "Microsoft Engineer\u8868\u793a\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728Windows 11\u4e0a\u4fa7\u8f7dAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f ", "title_en": "Microsoft engineer says users will be able to sideload Android Apps on Windows 11", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550689/windows-11-android-app-sideload-amazon-app-store?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "android", "microsoft", "\u7a0b\u5e8f", "engineer"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "78826308b14523f1baf28a8c22b34209.jpg", "infoid": 1068346, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u62a5\u7f72\u7f72\u957f\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u521a\u521a\u5c06\u5176\u70ed\u60c5\u9884\u671f\u7684\u201c\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\u201d\u62a5\u544a\u201c\uff0c\u8fd9\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u5bf9\u201d\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u98de\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u201c\uff08UFO\uff09\u7684\u8a00\u8bed\u91cd\u5851\u3002\n \u661f\u671f\u4e94\u665a\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5916\u5356\uff1a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u3002\u57289\u9875\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e94\u89d2\u5927\u697c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u548c\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u6254\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u624b\uff0c\u627f\u8ba4\u4ed6\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e0d\u660e\u98de\u884c\u7269\u7684\u76ee\u51fb\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u5728\u91ca\u653e\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f1a\u8bf4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5916\u6765\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u6765\u8fc7\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u9646\u5730\u89e3\u91ca -

In the  9-page document, the Pentagon\u2019s best and brightest essentially threw up their hands and admitted that they can\u2019t explain the vast majority of apparent UFO sightings.\n The report drew immense amounts of speculation before its release because of the remote possibility that it would say something concrete about alien life, but that didn\u2019t come to pass.\n \u201cWe have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them \u2014 but we will go wherever the data takes us,\u201d an anonymous US government official  told  NBC News shortly before the report was released. \u201cWe do not have any data that indicates that any of these unidentified air phenomena are part of a foreign collection program nor do we have any data that is indicative of a major technological advancement by a potential adversary.\u201d\n    \u201cThere are probably multiple types of UAP requiring different explanations based on the range of appearances and behaviors described in the available reporting,\u201d reads one section. \u201cOur analysis of the data supports the construct that if and when individual UAP incidents are resolved they will fall into one of five potential explanatory categories: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, USG or U.S. industry developmental programs, foreign adversary systems, and a catchall \u2018other\u2019 bin.\u201d\n In total, the report examined 144 incidents, 143 of which investigators were unable to explain.\n    \u201cIn a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings,\u201d reads one.\n \u201cThe UAPTF holds a small amount of data that appear to show UAP demonstrating acceleration or a degree of signature management,\u201d reads another.

And so, I&#39;m of the opinion that people have the right to decide whether to accept a vaccine or not, especially since these are experimental vaccines,&#34; said Dr. Robert Malone  during a Wednesday segment on Fox News&#39;s Tucker Carlson Tonight, saying YouTube deleted a video of him speaking about the associated risks.\n Opening the segment, Carlson shared some studies showing heart inflammation and death correlating with the use of the vaccines.\n &#34;A Norwegian study conducted of 100 nursing home residents who died after receiving Pfizer&#39;s corona shots. They found that at least 10 of those deaths were likely caused by the vaccine. 10%,&#34; Carlson said.\n  &#34;Young adults in the prime of their lives are being forced to take the vaccine because Tony Fauci said that,&#34; he said, contending Malone\u2019s expertise makes him &#34;the single most qualified&#34; person to share information about the technology and warrants him &#34;a right to speak.&#34;\n Malone clarified that he was not discouraging the use of the vaccine but was providing people with as much fair information as he could about their risks.\n &#34;This is a fundamental right having to do with clinical research ethics,&#34; he said. &#34;And so, my concern is that I know that there are risks. But we don&#39;t have access to the data, and the data haven&#39;t been captured rigorously enough so that we can accurately assess those risks \u2014 and therefore \u2026 we don&#39;t really have the information that we need to make a reasonable decision.&#34;\n  &#34;That&#39;s one of my other objections, is that we toss about these words, risk-benefit analysis, casually as if it&#39;s a very deep science. It&#39;s not. Normally, at this stage, the CDC [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] would have performed those risk-benefit analyses. They would be data-based and science-based. They&#39;re not right now,&#34; Malone said.\n  Malone also said he has &#34;a bias that the benefits probably don&#39;t outweigh the risks&#34; for younger people who are being encouraged or required to take the vaccine.\n &#34;I can say that the risk-benefit ratio for those 18 and below doesn&#39;t justify vaccines, and there&#39;s a pretty good chance that it doesn&#39;t justify vaccination in these very young adults,&#34; he added.\n Malone  discovered in-vitro and in-vivo RNA transfection when he was at the Salk Institute in 1988, and he subsequently invented mRNA vaccines, which are being used over 20 years later to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n YouTube told the Washington Examiner of the video that while it is &#34;open [to] discussions of potential treatments and clinical trials related to COVID-19 on YouTube, based on guidance from the CDC, FDA and other local health authorities, we don\u2019t currently allow content that recommends Ivermectin as an effective treatment or prevention method for the virus.&#34;\n &#34;As such, we removed content from Bret Weinstein&#39;s channels that violated this policy.

Of those, 247 had mild to moderate illnesses and isolated at home, never becoming sick enough to be admitted to a hospital. Six months after testing positive, 136 of the 247 (55 percent) still had lingering symptoms. And those 136 weren\u2019t only in the older age groups. In fact, in all the age groups between 16 and over 60 years old, between 50 percent and 60 percent of COVID patients reported persistent symptoms.\n For instance, of those between 16 and 30 years old, 52 percent (32 of 61) still suffered COVID-19 symptoms after six months. The most common symptoms were disturbed taste and/or smell, fatigue, difficulty breathing, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems.\n The study is small, and the exact percentages may not hold up in larger studies. However, it adds to a growing body of data finding that long-term symptoms from COVID-19 are common\u2014even in young people and/or people who had mild or even asymptomatic disease.\n    In  a non-peer-reviewed preprint study posted in March, researchers found that a third of the patients identified through medical records as suffering from so-called \u201clong-haul\u201d COVID-19 had initially reported asymptomatic cases. The study\u2019s authors, led by researchers in California, tracked the electronic medical records of 1,407 patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, but these individuals were not sick enough to be hospitalized when they were infected. Of the 1,407, about 27 percent\u2014382 people\u2014developed long-term symptoms, and a third of them were initially asymptomatic.\n Likewise, in  another study posted this month, researchers tracked health insurance records of nearly two million people who tested positive for the coronavirus. The researchers found that about 23 percent of the patients sought care for a new post-COVID medical condition one or more months later. Of the people who had mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 that didn&#39;t require hospitalization, 27 percent experienced persistent symptoms, as did 19 percent of people who initially reported asymptomatic cases.\n The authors of the Norwegian study expressed concern about finding mild cases in young people leading to long-term problems. \u201cIt is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cParticularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress\u2026 Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:38:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

large Oort Cloud object approaching the outer regions of the solar system.\n   The discovery has caused ripples of excitement within the planetary science community because of the object\u2019s unusually large size \u2013 initial estimates suggest it may be as big as 130\u2013160\u00a0km across, substantially bigger than some of the largest comets. Studying the object could also give researchers insights into an enigmatic process in the solar system.\n Catalogued as C/2014 UN271, the wandering visitor was found in archival data captured by the DES project, which investigates the cosmological mystery of dark energy by photographing distant galaxies.\n  \u201cThe object appears in about thirty images out of the [approximately] 80,000 that were taken over six years for the survey,\u201d  Gary Bernstein of the University of Pennsylvania, who co-discovered C/2014 UN271 along with PhD student  Pedro Bernardinelli, tells  Physics World. \u201cPedro instantly recognized it as being of special interest because of its nearly-escaping orbit and the great distance at which it was first seen,\u201d he adds.\n C/2014 UN271 seems to have come from a region some 10,000\u201320,000 times farther from the Sun than Earth. This is within the Oort Cloud \u2013 an immense shell of icy objects thought to envelop the entire solar system. On its current trajectory, the object takes nearly 5.5 million years to complete just one loop of its orbit.\n The object is probably rich in ice like a comet and is currently around three billion kilometres from the Sun. It will reach its closest point, known as perihelion, in 2031. At that time, it will be positioned below the plane of the solar system, near the orbit of Saturn.\n  Part of the interest in C/2014 UN271 is that it may be something of a transition object. Astronomers believe that many of the long period comets, that occasionally appear with bright tails, actually come from the Oort Cloud. Stars wandering near the Sun can nudge these objects from their positions and over millennia they work their way inwards, with the gravity of the giant planets tweaking their paths on each visit until they reside where we see them today.\n \u201cThe fact that [C/2014 UN271] has a perihelion so far away from the Sun might be telling us that it\u2019s done this a couple of times but is still in that process of eventually becoming some of those long period comets we know and love,\u201d explains  Meg Schwamb a Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud expert at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\n Scientists will be keen to see how C/2014 UN271 behaves on its long journey. Will it, for example, exhibit outbursts in activity, or even disintegrate? The  Vera C Rubin Observatory, due to begin its ground-breaking survey from Chile in 2023, should be in a prime position to record whatever happens. \u201cWith Rubin Observatory coming back and imaging the sky every three nights we\u2019re going to get an effective movie of how this object has evolved over a decade,\u201d says Schwamb.\n  Initially, C/2014 UN271 did not appear to have a cloud of material \u2013 called a coma \u2013 around it. However, astronomers using the  Las Cumbres Observatory network announced in an Astronomer\u2019s Telegram bulletin on 22 June that they have detected such a feature using a large telescope in South Africa. The emergence of a coma could be the result of ices sublimating from the body\u2019s surface.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a complex range of processes involved, with much yet to understand, and this is the biggest of the small worlds on an orbit from the Oort Cloud that we\u2019ve seen go through that start-up of activity,\u201d says  Michele Bannister, an outer solar system specialist based at the University of Canterbury.\n Some researchers have suggested C/2014 UN271 could be a destination for a sample-return mission.

Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scrambled to save faltering markets at the start of the pandemic last year, America\u2019s top economic officials were in near-constant contact with a Wall Street executive whose firm stood to benefit financially from the rescue.\n  Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, was in frequent touch with Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Powell in the days before and after many of the Fed\u2019s emergency rescue programs were announced in late March. Emails obtained by The New York Times through a records request, along with public releases, underscore the extent to which Mr. Fink planned alongside the government for parts of a financial rescue that his firm referred to in one message as \u201cthe project\u201d that he and the Fed were \u201cworking on together.\u201d\n While some conversations were previously disclosed, the  newly released emails, together with public calendar records, show the extent to which economic policymakers worked with a private company as they were drawing up a response to the financial meltdown and how intertwined BlackRock has become with the federal government.\n Mr. Mnuchin held  60 recorded calls over the frantic Saturday and Sunday leading up to the Fed\u2019s  unveiling on Monday, March 23, of a policy package that included its first-ever program to buy corporate bonds, which were becoming nearly impossible to sell as investors sprinted to convert their holdings to cash. Mr. Mnuchin spoke to Mr. Fink five times that weekend, more than anyone other than the Fed chair, whom he spoke with nine times. Mr. Fink joined Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Powell and Larry Kudlow, who was the White House National Economic Council director, for a brief call at 7:25 the evening before the Fed\u2019s big announcement, based on Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s calendars.\n  The records reveal how often federal officials engaged with a Wall Street executive at a moment of crisis, as they strategized about how to turn around markets that were descending into chaos. Mr. Fink\u2019s firm is a huge player across many stock and debt markets, and its advisory arm helped to execute some of the Fed\u2019s crisis response during the 2008 financial meltdown. That market insight and experience got him a front-row seat at a pivotal moment, one that may have put him in a position to influence a rescue with huge ramifications for households, businesses and the entire U.S. economy.\n \u201cThey\u2019re about as close to a government arm as you can be, without being the Federal Reserve,\u201d said William Birdthistle, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and the author of a  book on funds.\n On March 24, 2020, the New York Fed announced that it had again hired BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm, which operates separately from the company\u2019s asset-management business but which Mr. Fink oversees, this time to carry out the Fed\u2019s purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and  corporate bonds.\n BlackRock\u2019s ability to directly profit from its regular contact with the government during rescue planning was limited. The firm signed a nondisclosure agreement with the New York Fed on March 22, restricting involved officials from sharing information about the coming programs.\n But how the Fed and Treasury devised their rescue package mattered to BlackRock. The company makes a profit by managing money for clients in an array of funds, generally charging a preset fee. It earns more when assets under its management grow. In the early days of the coronavirus crisis, as people converted financial holdings into cash, parts of its asset base  were contracting and its business outlook hinged on what happened in certain markets.\n While the Fed and Treasury consulted with many financial firms as they drew up their response \u2014 and practically all of Wall Street and much of Main Street  benefited \u2014 no other company was as front and center.\n Simply being in touch throughout the government\u2019s planning was good for BlackRock, potentially burnishing its image over the longer run, Mr. Birdthistle said. BlackRock would have benefited through \u201ctons of information, tons of secondary financial benefits,\u201d he said.\n Mr. Mnuchin could not be reached for comment. Asked whether top Fed officials discussed program details with Mr. Fink before his firm had signed the nondisclosure agreement, the Fed said Mr. Powell and Randal K. Quarles, a Fed vice chair who also appears in the emails, \u201chave no recollection of discussing the terms of either facility with Mr. Fink.\u201d\n \u201cNor did they have any reason to do so because the Federal Reserve Bank of New York handled the process with great care and transparency,\u201d the central bank added in its statement.\n Brian Beades, a spokesman for BlackRock, highlighted that the firm had \u201cstringent information barriers in place that ensure separation between BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory and the firm\u2019s investment business.\u201d He said it was \u201cproud to have been in a position to assist the Federal Reserve in addressing the severe downturn in financial markets during the depths of the crisis.\u201d\n  The disclosed emails between Fed and BlackRock officials \u2014 11 in all across March and early April \u2014 do not make clear whether the company knew about any of the Fed and Treasury programs\u2019 designs or whether they were simply providing market information.\n Emails indicate that Mr. Powell spoke with Mr. Fink on March 23, hours after the Fed announced its corporate bond program.\n \u201cLarry Fink is available to speak today regarding the project you will be working on together,\u201d an email from Mr. Fink\u2019s assistant directly to Mr. Powell said. \u201cPlease let us know if there is a convenient time for you.\u201d\n  The call does not appear on the  Fed chair\u2019s official schedule from that March. Those calendars generally track scheduled events, and may have missed meetings in early 2020 when staff members were frantically working on the market rescue and the Fed was shifting to work from home, a central bank spokesman said.\n Mr. Powell\u2019s calendars did show that he talked to Mr. Fink in March, April and May, and he has previously answered questions about those discussions.\n \u201cI can\u2019t recall exactly what those conversations were, but they would have been about what he is seeing in the markets and things like that, to generally exchanging information,\u201d Mr. Powell said at a  July news conference, adding that it wasn\u2019t \u201cvery many\u201d conversations. \u201cHe\u2019s typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads.\u201d\n BlackRock\u2019s connections to Washington are not new. It was a critical player in the 2008 crisis response, when the New York Fed  retained the firm\u2019s advisory arm to manage the mortgage assets of the insurance giant American International Group and Bear Stearns.\n Several former BlackRock employees have been named to top roles in President Biden\u2019s administration,  including Brian Deese, who heads the White House National Economic Council, and Wally Adeyemo, who was Mr. Fink\u2019s chief of staff and is now the No. 2 official at the Treasury.\n The firm has grown rapidly: Its assets under management swelled from $1.3 trillion  in early 2009 to $7.4 trillion in 2019. By the end of  last year, they were $8.7 trillion.\n As it expanded, it has stepped up its lobbying. In 2004, BlackRock Inc.  registered two lobbyists and spent less than $200,000 on its efforts. By 2019 it had 20 lobbyists and spent nearly $2.5 million, though that declined slightly last year, based on OpenSecrets data.  Campaign contributions tied to the firm also jumped, touching $1.7 million in 2020 (80 percent to Democrats, 20 percent to Republicans) from next to nothing as recently as 2004.\n  In March, as some of BlackRock\u2019s own offerings were being rocked at the pandemic\u2019s onset in the United States, the firm reached out to Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles, the emails show. In one or two cases, BlackRock appears to have had phone calls with Mr. Quarles. In others, Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles did not reply, based on the released records.\n The firm\u2019s representatives also talked to Treasury policymakers other than Mr. Mnuchin in March, the emails show. One former official said such calls were part of routine information-gathering from a big market participant when markets were rapidly falling apart.\n BlackRock operates in  short-term debt markets that came under intense stress as people and companies rushed to move all of their holdings into cash. And problems were brewing in the corporate debt market, including in exchange-traded funds, which track bundles of corporate debt and other assets but trade like stocks. Corporate bonds were difficult to trade and near impossible to issue in mid-March 2020. Prices on some high-grade corporate debt E.T.F.s, including one of BlackRock\u2019s,  were out of whack relative to the values of the underlying assets, which is unusual.\n People could still pull their money from E.T.F.s, which both the industry and several outside academics have heralded as a sign of their resiliency. But investors would have had to take a financial hit to do so, relative to the quoted value of the underlying bonds. That could have bruised the product\u2019s reputation in the eyes of some retail savers.\n \u201cThis was the first time that E.T.F.s came under stress in a really systemic way,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, associate director for economic policy at the Center for American Progress.\n The Fed\u2019s programs helped to turn that around. The central bank supported the corporate bond market on March 23, 2020, by pledging to buy both already issued debt and new bonds. The program for existing bonds promised to also buy E.T.F.s, because they are a quick way to get access to a wide swath of the market. The bond market and  fund recovery was nearly instant.\n When the New York Fed retained BlackRock\u2019s advisory arm to make the purchases, it  rapidly disclosed details of those contracts to the public. The firm did the program cheaply for the government, waiving fees for exchange-traded fund buying and rebating fees from its own iShares E.T.F.s back to the New York Fed.\n The Fed has explained the decision to hire the advisory side of the house in terms of practicality.\n \u201cWe hired BlackRock for their expertise in these markets,\u201d Mr. Powell  has since said in defense of the rapid move. \u201cIt was done very quickly due to the urgency and need for their expertise.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:30:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

", "note_en": "Report says intelligence sources do not think aliens are behind UFOs but what they are is unclear\n   The mystery of  UFOs seen in American skies is likely to continue following the release of the US government\u2019s highly anticipated UFO report.\n The  report released on Friday afternoon made clear that while American intelligence officials do not believe aliens are behind the UFOs \u2013 or what scientists prefer to call unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) \u2013 that were observed by navy pilots, they cannot explain what the flying objects are.\n  The report confirms that the observed phenomena are not part of any US military operations.\n The Pentagon studied over 140 incidents reported by navy pilots of UAP seen over the last two decades for the report. Many were seen from the summer of 2014 into the spring of 2015.\n While the report said that some incidents could be the result of technological errors in sensors or observers, it noted that most of the UAP reported \u201cprobably do represent physical objects\u201d since they were registered across multiple sensors.\n The only UAP intelligence officials were able to identify \u201cwith high confidence\u201d turned out to be \u201ca large, deflating balloon\u201d.\n   The release of the report caps a six-month wait, since a group of elected officials succeeded in including the  Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 in a $2.3tn coronavirus relief bill signed by Donald Trump last December.\n The act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified \u201cdetailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence\u201d and \u201ca detailed description of an interagency process\u201d for reporting UAP.\n In August, the Pentagon  resurrected a UAP investigations arm, calling it the UAP Task Force and directing it to \u201cdetect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to US national security\u201d. The taskforce and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence authored the report.\n The report notes that only since 2019 has the government had a standardized reporting system for UAPs, so \u201climited data and inconsistency in reporting\u201d were challenges in investigations.\n \u201cThe limited amount of high-quality reporting on unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP,\u201d the report reads.\n The discussion of UFOs \u2013 at government level or outside it \u2013 has been stigmatized for decades. While some have used the UAP materials as fodder for theories on alien life, officials have pointed to the possible threat of the UAPs being from an adversary using technology unknown to the US.\n \u201cIn this country we\u2019ve had incidents where these UAPs have interfered and actually brought offline our nuclear capabilities,\u201d Luis Elizondo, former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the earlier iteration of the Pentagon\u2019s UAP taskforce, told the  Washington Post. Elizondo resigned in 2017, out of frustration that UAP were not being taken seriously enough by defense leaders.\n  \u201cWe also have data suggesting that in other countries these things have interfered with their nuclear technology and actually turned them on, put them online.\u201d\n While the US government was ordered to publish the unclassified report, experts said that a classified annex, which the public will not see, contains some of the juiciest details.\n In recent years, the release of government videos showing unexplained flying things have provided firmer evidence that something, alien or not, is out there.\n Footage from two sightings in 2015 and a third in 2004 taken during training flights went viral online after they were leaked. The Pentagon ultimately confirmed the authenticity of the footage and  released them for the public in 2020.\n One of the videos shows an object resembling a flying, spinning top soaring through the air. \u201cLook at that thing!\u201d one of the pilots can be heard saying in amazement.\n  This April, more photos and videos taken by US navy personnel were  leaked online, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky. In May, leaked military footage showed  an oval flying object near a US navy ship off San Diego, an apparent hotspot for UAP.\n Members of the US navy have seen UAP frequently. Ryan Graves, a retired pilot,  told 60 Minutes pilots saw UAP in restricted airspace south-east of Virginia Beach \u201cevery day\u201d in 2014.\n  In a  statement released on Friday after the report\u2019s release, the Republican senator Marco Rubio, who has been a staunch advocate for investigation into UAPs, celebrated the report but emphasized that it is \u201cjust a first step\u201d.\n \u201cFor years, the men and women we trust to defend our country reported encounters with unidentified aircraft that has superior capabilities, and for years their concerns were often ignored and ridiculed,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe Defense Department and intelligence community have a lot of work to do before we can actually understand whether these aerial threats present a serious national security concern.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 06:29:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u53d1\u5e03,releases,\u62a5\u544a", "title": "\u5b83\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u671f\u7684UFO\u62a5\u544a ", "title_en": "It came out of the sky: US releases highly anticipated UFO report", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/ufos-us-government-report", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u53d1\u5e03", "releases", "\u62a5\u544a"]}]
