Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation,\u201d the CCI said in its 21-page order.\n  The probe follows a complaint from Digital News Publishers Association, which consists of the digital arms of some of India\u2019s biggest media firms. The association said their members get more than half of their traffic from online search engines, a category Google clearly commands, and the market-leading position has allowed Google to force the publishers into several unfavorable terms.\n In a wide-ranging complaint, the association said Google displaying snippets of news items limits the number of visitors to news outlets and impacts the ad revenue \u201cwhile Google continue[s] to earn ad revenue on its result page\u201d as well as enriches \u201cits search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries.\u201d\n \u201cIt has also been averred that the terms of the agreements entered between the members of the Informant [news publishers] and the OPs [Google and its subsidiaries] for sharing the advertisement revenues are unilaterally and arbitrarily dictated by the OPs, and the members of the Informant have no other option but to accept the terms, as they are, with no bargaining power whatsoever,\u201d the watchdog said.\n \u201cThe only alternate to the AMP system is for publishers to subscribe with Google, which benefits Google, to the detriment of the publishers,\u201d the watchdog said. The association accused that Google is forcing them to use its  AMP format, which has implications on their revenue.\n   \u201cIn a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders,\u201d the watchdog added.\n Friday\u2019s investigation is the latest of a series of probes the Indian competition watchdog has ordered in recent weeks.

M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawai\u02bbi Island \u2013 a team of researchers conducting the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient survey observed the red supergiant during its last 130 days leading up to its deadly detonation.\n \u201cThis is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,\u201d says Wynn Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley and lead author of the study. \u201cDirect detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova. For the first time, we watched a red supergiant star explode!\u201d\n  Pan-STARRS first detected the doomed massive star in Summer of 2020 via the huge amount of light radiating from the red supergiant. A few months later, in Fall of 2020, a supernova lit the sky.\n The team quickly captured the powerful flash and obtained the very first spectrum of the energetic explosion, named supernova 2020tlf, or SN 2020tlf, using Keck Observatory\u2019s Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS). The data showed direct evidence of dense circumstellar material surrounding the star at the time of explosion, likely the same exact gas that Pan-STARRS had imaged the red supergiant star violently ejecting earlier in the summer.\n   An artist\u2019s rendition of a red supergiant star transitioning into a Type II supernova, emitting a violent eruption of radiation and gas on its dying breath before collapsing and exploding. Credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/Adam Makarenko\n  \u201cKeck was instrumental in providing direct evidence of a massive star transitioning into a supernova explosion,\u201d says senior author Raffaella Margutti, an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a ticking time bomb. We\u2019ve never confirmed such violent activity in a dying red supergiant star where we see it produce such a luminous emission, then collapse and combust, until now.\u201d\n The team continued to monitor SN 2020tlf after the explosion; based on data obtained from Keck Observatory\u2019s DEep Imaging and Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) and Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES), they determined SN 2020tlf\u2019s progenitor red supergiant star, located in the NGC 5731 galaxy about 120 million light-years away as seen from Earth, was 10 times more massive than the Sun.\n The discovery defies previous ideas of how red supergiant stars evolve right before blowing up. Prior to this, all red supergiants observed before exploding were relatively quiescent: they showed no evidence of violent eruptions or luminous emission, as was observed prior to SN 2020tlf. However, this novel detection of bright radiation coming from a red supergiant in the final year before exploding suggests that at least some of these stars must undergo significant changes in their internal structure that then results in the tumultuous ejection of gas moments before they collapse.\n Margutti and Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n conducted most of the study during their time at Northwestern University, with Margutti serving as an Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy and member of CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics), and Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n as a graduate student.\n The team\u2019s discovery paves a path forward for transient surveys like YSE to hunt for luminous radiation coming from red supergiants, and gather more evidence that such behavior could signal the imminent, supernova demise of a massive star.\n \u201cI am most excited by all of the new \u2018unknowns\u2019 that have been unlocked by this discovery,\u201d says Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n. \u201cDetecting more events like SN 2020tlf will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution, uniting observers and theorists in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives.\u201d\n   The\u00a0Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)\u00a0is a very versatile and ultra-sensitive visible-wavelength imager and spectrograph built at the California Institute of Technology by a team led by Prof. Bev Oke and Prof. Judy Cohen and commissioned in 1993. Since then it has seen two major upgrades to further enhance its capabilities: the addition of a second, blue arm optimized for shorter wavelengths of light and the installation of detectors that are much more sensitive at the longest (red) wavelengths. Each arm is optimized for the wavelengths it covers.\u00a0This large range of wavelength coverage, combined with the instrument\u2019s high sensitivity, allows the study of everything from comets (which have interesting features in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum), to the blue light from star formation, to the red light of very distant objects.\u00a0LRIS also records the spectra of up to 50 objects simultaneously, especially useful for studies of clusters of galaxies in the most distant reaches, and earliest times, of the universe.\u00a0LRIS was used in observing distant supernovae by astronomers who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for research determining that the universe was speeding up in its expansion.\n  The DEep Imaging and Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) boasts the largest field of view (16.7arcmin by 5 arcmin) of any of the Keck Observatory instruments, and the largest number of pixels (64 Mpix). It is used primarily in its multi-object mode, obtaining simultaneous spectra of up to 130 galaxies or stars. Astronomers study fields of distant galaxies with DEIMOS, efficiently probing the most distant corners of the universe with high sensitivity.\n  The Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES) is a prism cross-dispersed near-infrared spectrograph built at the California Institute of Technology by a team led by Chief Instrument Scientist Keith Matthews and Prof. Tom Soifer. Commissioned in 2018, NIRES covers a large wavelength range at moderate spectral resolution for use on the Keck II telescope and observes extremely faint red objects found with the Spitzer and WISE infrared space telescopes, as well as brown dwarfs, high-redshift galaxies, and quasars. Support for this technology was generously provided by the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation.\n  The W. M. Keck Observatory telescopes are among the most scientifically productive on Earth. The two 10-meter optical/infrared telescopes atop Maunakea on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi feature a suite of advanced instruments including imagers, multi-object spectrographs, high-resolution spectrographs, integral-field spectrometers, and world-leading laser guide star adaptive optics systems.\u00a0Some of the data presented herein were obtained at Keck Observatory, which is a private 501(c) 3 non-profit organization operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Maunakea has always had within the Native Hawaiian community.\u00a0We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 04:33:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89c1\u8bc1,witness,deimos", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u89c1\u8bc1\u7740\u5782\u6b7b\u7684\u660e\u661f\u8fbe\u5230\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40", "title_en": "Astronomers Witness a Dying Star Reach Its Explosive End", "transed": 1, "url": "https://keckobservatory.org/dying-star/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c1\u8bc1", "witness", "deimos"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eacd6db4f090f9a8c3c6d49130509437.png", "infoid": 1072552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "RSS\u6e90\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aGovInfo\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u5e03\u7684100\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "note_en": "RSS feeds are available for many govinfo collections and generally include the 100 most recent documents published.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 04:32:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "feeds,govinfo", "title": "RSS\u6e90\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u6b63\u5728\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "RSS Feeds about what the Government is doing", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/feeds", "via": "", "real_tags": ["feeds", "govinfo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "debde01b42432d05c75483c0372bddf7.jpeg", "infoid": 1072551, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8b66\u65b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u201c\u6d3e\u9063\u201d\u5230\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5207 - \u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a", "note_en": "Police can access everything from \u201cpokes\u201d to private Messenger data \u2014 and increasingly do\n  In mid-September of 2019, Violet, a friend of mine, was jolted awake by a sound every activist dreads: the police door knock.

His brand of optimism is far more reserved than the full-throttle enthusiasm often associated with self-help gurus. \u201cWe don\u2019t live in a world of sunshine and lollipops,\u201d as he puts it. \u201cWe live in a real world of deadlines, sweat, blisters and muscle fatigue, and we have to look at what is a constructive way to think in those situations.\u201d\n In addition to his army duties, in his private practice Zinsser has worked with a glittering roster of clients, including neurosurgeons, congressional candidates, ballerinas, writers and star athletes, such as two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback  Eli Manning. Whether their arena is the surgical table or the running track, they come to him for gamechanging advice on how to dispel those pesky naysaying voices in their head so that they can deliver knockout performances under pressure. And now he\u2019s distilled his knowledge into a book,   The Confident Mind: A Battle-Tested Guide to Unshakable Performance.\n I\u2019m hoping to glean some tips from the famed confidence-whisperer. While hardly a quivering mess, I do have a habit of second-guessing myself in parts of my professional \u2013 and social \u2013 life. And the thought of public speaking sends me into a cold sweat. The chance to smooth out the chinks in my self-belief armour and come away with a quarterback\u2019s swagger is tempting to say the least.\n But is it realistic? We tend to view confidence as a magical elixir that\u2019s only available to Olympic sprinters, CEOs and other creatures blessed with rare talent, puffed-out chests and Colgate-white teeth (plus, the odd blustering buffoon). For most of us, being an adult means having a PhD in our multitude of shortcomings, foibles and crippling insecurities. And while I can improve my fitness with a Peloton, and my inner calm with meditation, surely I can\u2019t just learn how to think highly of myself, can I? How to be unflappable under pressure? How to believe \u2013 with a surety that overrides any lingering doubts \u2013 that I can be good at anything?\n In his poised, methodical way, Zinsser is here to tell me that, if I doggedly commit to altering the story I tell myself about myself, then yes: yes I can.\n First, some house  keeping: Zinsser wants to straighten out some common misconceptions around confidence \u2013 starting with how we define it. Although we tend to think of it as a sense of belief in one\u2019s own ability, he finds this unhelpful because it neglects a crucial fact: we are hardwired to perform skills unconsciously. When we\u2019re in the zone \u2013 whether during a tennis match, maths exam or violin concerto \u2013 we\u2019re not critically assessing each movement but operating in a free-flowing state. \u201cIf you\u2019re hung up with the mechanics, and trying to think about what you\u2019re doing as you\u2019re doing it, you access a whole lot of neural pathways that tie you up,\u201d he says. He defines confidence, then, as having \u201cthe sense of certainty about your ability that allows you to do something without thinking about it: that allows you to execute more or less unconsciously.\u201d\n Being in this state makes success possible, not guaranteed. It won\u2019t conceal a lack of ability, but it will enable you to go into a performance thinking: \u201cI\u2019ve got this money in my wallet and now I can spend it \u2013 let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got enough,\u201d he says. Without confidence, we\u2019ll never know how good \u2013 how talented, how skilled \u2013 an individual really is.\n For most of us, being an adult means having a PhD in our multitude of shortcomings, foibles and crippling insecurities\n Zinsser doesn\u2019t particularly see confidence as a product of genetics. Nor is it necessarily linked to competence. Sure, we idolise superstar athletes whose talent and bravado seem to go hand-in-hand, but he comes across just as many gifted people lacking self-belief. \u201cThe unfortunate fact I have seen is that our actual competence is higher than our degree of confidence in it,\u201d he says, speaking about the population generally. \u201cIt\u2019s the conclusion you draw about yourself from experiences of success [that breeds confidence],\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you make those conclusions, the actual success that you have might not do you any good.\u201d\n He believes confidence is cultivated during childhood \u2013 \u201chow you were encouraged as a young person to think about yourself\u201d \u2013 and cites as an example   King Richard, the recent biopic showing Richard Williams constantly telling his daughters Serena and Venus that they were destined to become the world\u2019s best tennis players.\n Can anyone become more confident or is it only attainable for certain individuals? He pauses for a few beats, chewing over his words. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite possible for anyone to develop a greater sense of certainty,\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cSome people might have to overcome more baggage from their past than others, but I\u2019m quite a believer in that kind of human potential.\u201d\n In any event, there\u2019s no such thing as \u201ca confident person\u201d; it\u2019s more that you\u2019re confident in a particular skill or situation (and even within a skill, you\u2019ll feel better about some things than others). Case in point: Eli Manning. The former NFL superstar, who twice led the New York Giants to Super Bowl triumphs, \u201cwas very confident in his ability to throw certain balls and reach certain defences, but he did not like to stand up and talk in front of a crowd,\u201d says Zinsser. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the case for all of us: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s confident across the board.\u201d\n \u201cHave you ever produced good work in suboptimal conditions?\u201d asks Zinsser rhetorically. We\u2019re back to helping me forge a bulletproof writing mindset. \u201cI would think so,\u201d he continues, \u201cotherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be in the job you\u2019re in. So what you need to be reinforcing, a story that you need to tell yourself about yourself, is: \u2018I work well, despite distractions. I work well, in almost any condition. My editor can count on me to deliver quality work, even when things are chaotic around me.\u2019\u201d\n This rather simple reframing of how I view myself feels pretty significant. And I put it into immediate practice: in a meta situation, I\u2019m writing this article from a cramped plane seat en route to Australia, a series of pre-flight texts from my editor demanding reassurance that I will be able to deliver words by the deadline still warming my phone. With each blood-curdling wail from a baby in a nearby bassinet, I repeat my new mantra about myself with an increasingly feverish vigour.\n Yet there\u2019s much more to be done. Zinsser likens confidence to a mental \u201cbank account\u201d that we must constantly top up with valuable deposits. That includes mining our memories for instances of when we have done things well. After each training session, or day at work, we should devote about five minutes to reflecting on things we have accomplished and committing them to our \u201cinternal hard drive\u201d. No victory is too small for inclusion. (He also notes that it\u2019s worth spending time looking ahead and envisioning, in realistic HD-film quality, the dreams you most desire.)\n This can apply to whatever knee-knocking situation is keeping you up. Plagued with impostor-syndrome thoughts of not being qualified to do your job? \u201cI\u2019d tell you to give me the whole of your r\u00e9sum\u00e9,\u201d says Zinsser. \u201cWe\u2019re so good at overlooking the skills that we have cultivated, the effort that we have put in to develop ourselves to the point where we are indeed employable and competent. Look for some of the reasons that you are indeed the genuine person for the job.\u201d\n His book contains countless tactics for keeping that bank account fat by recasting how you think about your missteps. Some are sourced from  Martin Seligman, the father of \u201cpositive psychology\u201d. These acknowledge that you will have negative thoughts and will make mistakes, but you can effectively see them off by viewing them as \u201ctemporary (\u201cIt\u2019s just this one time\u201d), limited (\u201cIt\u2019s just in this one place\u201d) and non-representative (\u201cthat\u2019s not the truth about me\u201d). There are physical techniques, too: keeping your shoulders slightly back and eyes straight ahead will improve your posture, while focusing on breathing during a performance can be a powerful way to bring a feeling of control and yank you into the present moment. (Note that none of these require you to obnoxiously strut about like  The Wolf of Wall Street.)\n The most extreme example of selective thinking, the \u201cshooter\u2019s mentality\u201d pursued by Golden State Warriors basketballer  Stephen Curry, involves treating missed shots as temporary and as an omen that you\u2019re about to experience a return to fortune (\u201cI\u2019m bound to make the next one\u201d), while viewing successes as permanent (\u201cNow I\u2019m on a roll\u201d).\n One nagging thought I had while reading these passages: building confidence often requires you to ignore logic. This took me back to the late 2000s when, as a tennis-obsessed teen who travelled around Australia competing in tournaments, my on-court confidence was fragile at best. If my warmup went badly, I was convinced the whole match would be a disaster. And I couldn\u2019t get my head into the game if I had assessed, pre-encounter, that my opponent was better than me \u2013 smoother technique, bigger shots, flashy overseas academy training. In those instances, I was defeated before the match started. As often happens when we enter a situation devoid of confidence, it became a self-fulling prophecy.\n There is a tendency in our modern world to over-identify with our shortcomings and even define ourselves by our mistakes\n If someone had told me about the shooter\u2019s mentality, which Zinsser calls a \u201cthermonuclear psychological weapon\u201d, I would\u2019ve said: \u201cGreat, but how am I actually meant to believe these things?\u201d To cast aside all reason and buy into a fantasyland where errors lead to success and success  also leads to success?\n  It is, he replies. But the way to wholeheartedly believe in it is to practise it, repeating these mantras, memories and mental tricks until the story they tell becomes \u201cyour dominant way of thinking about yourself in that context\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s got to become your dominant habit of thinking about yourself \u2013 just like you brush your teeth every morning and night \u2013 if you want it to materialise in a challenging atmosphere. You can\u2019t just turn it on. It has to be already in you.\u201d He can\u2019t say how long this could take: for some clients it\u2019s happened after only a few sessions, while for others it has taken six months of conscientious observance before it became endemic to their thinking.\n In case confidence wasn\u2019t slippery enough, once you have gained it, the struggle continues. \u201cWe\u2019re all imperfect beings and, no matter how many times you practise that second serve, occasionally you\u2019re going to mess it up,\u201d says Zinsser. Confidence is more delicate than a handblown vase. Acquiring some of it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to have it for ever. It can easily be knocked down. You\u2019re going to have to wake up again tomorrow and rebuild it.\u201d\n Talk of confidence has been around for as long as humans have been going into battle. Zinsser\u2019s book opens with a quote from the legendary Chinese general Sun Tzu who, in his fifth-century BC treatise  The Art of War, declared: \u201cVictorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.\u201d\n Yet now, perhaps more than ever, individuals need to embrace self-assured thinking. Modern society is, at best, \u201cvery ambivalent\u201d about confidence and is not about to puff us up, says Zinsser. Growing up, we\u2019re taught that a soup\u00e7on of it is good; any more and we risk becoming smug or arrogant and therefore unlikable. Zinsser believes the biggest hurdle to striving for greater confidence is \u201cthe misguided impression that if I become certain about myself, I will somehow become lazy and complacent and I will lose my fire and motivation to improve,\u201d he says. \u201cBoy, is that a big misconception.\u201d\n As part of our education and socialisation, we\u2019re taught to focus on fixing imperfections and mistakes, marking every facet of our lives with red pens. \u201cThere is a curious tendency in our modern world to over-identify with our shortcomings and even define ourselves by our mistakes, presumed limitations, and all the things we can\u2019t yet do,\u201d writes Zinsser. While he admits that there\u2019s a time for being a harsh critic, \u201cthere\u2019s also just as much value in being one\u2019s best friend\u201d.\n Social media hasn\u2019t helped the cause. \u201cThe 24/7, nonstop barrage of messages are always putting these somewhat false images in front of us: \u2018Look at me, at this place, enjoying this wonderful day and this fabulous drink,\u201d he says. \u201cIt tends to make us think, \u2018Well, gee, I\u2019m not in a beautiful location with a beautiful someone enjoying a beautiful drink. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019\u201d\n Are we less confident than previous generations? There\u2019s another long, reflective pause from Zinsser. In the 1950s and 1960s, he says, \u201cThere was a whole generation or two of folks who really grew up believing, \u2018Things can be better, I can have a great life, I can succeed. Today, with the generation that\u2019s grown up online, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s the same general level of optimism,\u201d he says. \u201cMy sense is that maybe we\u2019re not quite as confident and optimistic now.\u201d\n All the more reason to get to work on that movie about your life in which you\u2019re the charming protagonist who completes everything \u2013 real feats from your past and wishlist goals alike \u2013 at a remarkable level. It takes dedication to stream this flick in your mind each night, sure, but it makes all that other hard work you\u2019ve done \u2013 the backhand drills, the weekend reading, the university degrees, the blood and sweat \u2013 worthwhile by putting your head in the game come crunch time.\n Zinsser calls it the cherry on top. \u201cIt\u2019s the decision to say: \u2018I\u2019ve done the work. I know what I know. I\u2019m going to deliver now. I am enough.\u2019\u201d\n The Confident Mind: A Battle-Tested Guide to Unshakable Performance by Dr Nate Zinsser is published on 27 January by Cornerstone Press at \u00a314.99.

Hackers  made off with a variety of tokens on December 4th after using a stolen privacy key to gain access to one of BitMart\u2019s hot wallets, otherwise known as a crypto wallet that\u2019s connected to the internet.\n Shortly after the incident,  BitMart announced that it would use its own funding \u201cto cover the incident and compensate affected users.\u201d However, as  CNBC reports, there are still several frustrated users who have yet to see their funds returned.\n CNBC\u2019s report details the experience of an Iranian refugee who says he stored $53,000 worth of SafeMoon on BitMart, $40,000 of which is from a loan. The outlet also got in touch with a Kansas-based investor who has $35,000 in limbo \u2014 he claims that he and 6,800 other investors may file a class-action lawsuit against BitMart if nothing\u2019s done to resolve the situation.\n  Of all the tokens stolen in the BitMart hack,  data from blockchain security company, PeckShield, shows that SafeMoon was hit hardest. As pointed out by  CNBC, SafeMoon holders are fighting back on Twitter, and have been flooding the site with the  #WenBitMart hashtag to demand the return of their funds. This may be the only way users feel they can call attention to the issue, as  CNBC reports some users are met with vague responses when contacting BitMart to check on the status of their lost funds.\n It remains unclear just how BitMart plans on reimbursing all affected users.  CNBC notes that while the exchange could buy back all of the tokens lost, it may be doing so when those tokens are at a much higher value.

According to floor plans seen by The Wall Street Journal, the site will comprise outdoor and indoor seating, a front-of-house pizza oven, a back-of-house kitchen and an interior waiting bench.\n    The idea is for Deliveroo staff to learn how to manage a restaurant that offers dine-in and delivery, working out how best to balance the needs of both types of diners at peak times, the company said.\n    Deliveroo has experience running food-service operations. The company in 2016 began opening Deliveroo Editions, locations known as \u201cdark kitchens\u201d or \u201cghost kitchens,\u201d where multiple restaurant brands operate kitchens exclusively for delivery in one central space. It now operates nearly 300 such kitchens globally, in markets including the U.K., United Arab Emirates, France and Hong Kong.\n  But owning and operating a restaurant for eat-in customers is a novel concept for a technology business, said Trish Caddy, a senior food-service analyst at London-based market-research company Mintel Group Ltd. and a former restaurant chef and manager.\n  If Deliveroo uses its Swiss Cottage location to draw up a replicable operational blueprint for other eateries, it might be able to attract more restaurateurs into its network, she said.\n  \u201cIt could be people who say, \u2018We\u2019ve been running a mom-and-pop restaurant for forever, but we don\u2019t know how to adapt to accommodate this new world of home delivery, takeout and click-and-collect,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Caddy said.\n  Deliveroo\u2019s move comes as San Francisco-based  DoorDash  is reinstating a program, suspended earlier in the pandemic, that asks every employee to carry out a delivery shift or shadow a customer-service agent once a month to better understand how their service works.\n  Food-delivery companies can easily become disconnected from the restaurateurs and delivery people who power their platforms, said Nabeel Alamgir, who in 2019 founded Lunchbox Technologies Inc., a startup that allows restaurants to build ordering experiences on their own websites and apps. Earlier, Mr. Alamgir was chief marketing officer of Bareburger Group LLC after starting out as a busboy at the company\u2019s first location.\n    \u201cI can feel the distance, in losing touch with what is the challenge of being a restaurateur, just a tiny bit, and I\u2019m just three years out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m always in the restaurants.\u201d\n  Gaining more empathy for customers might help delivery companies find a competitive edge in a crowded sector that has  struggled to find a path to profitability, Mr. Alamgir said.\n  Deliveroo reported a pretax loss of \u00a3104.8 million for the first half of 2021, compared with a year-earlier loss of \u00a3128.4 million.\n  Shares in Deliveroo  fell 26% on their first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange last March, as investors worried whether the company could maintain the momentum driven by high volumes of customer orders made during European pandemic lockdowns. Deliveroo shares closed at \u00a31.97 on Friday, down 49% from their IPO price of \u00a33.90.\n  Transactions processed on Deliveroo\u2019s platform during the third quarter of 2021 rose 54% to \u00a31.59 billion, equivalent to $2.17 billion, from \u00a31.04 billion in the year-earlier quarter.\n  The third quarter\u2019s results marked a decline from the second quarter, when transactions totaled \u00a31.74 billion. Deliveroo said the drop was typical for the season, but told investors the third quarter also brought particular challenges for its restaurant partners in many markets, as they contended with a full return of dine-in customers alongside sustained high demand for delivery, as well as supply-chain issues and labor shortages.\n      Deloitte  More CMO Insights from  Deloitte The Wall Street Journal news department was not involved in the creation of this content.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 03:31:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8ba1\u5212,kitchens,\u62c5\u5fc3", "title": "\u9001\u8fbe\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u4f26\u6566\u5f00\u8bbe\u4e00\u5bb6\u9910\u5385\uff0c\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3restaurateurs;\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fd0\u8425\u301c300\u201c\u9ed1\u6697\u201d\u53a8\u623f", "title_en": "Deliveroo plans to open a restaurant in London, its first, to better understand restaurateurs; the company currently operates ~300 \u201cdark\u201d kitchens globally", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/deliveroo-probing-restaurant-delivery-snags-plans-to-open-own-eatery-11641590210?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8ba1\u5212", "kitchens", "\u62c5\u5fc3"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072546, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aFlux3D Beamo 30W CO2\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u5c5e\u96d5\u523b\u9884\u8bbe\uff0850\uff05\u529f\u7387\uff0c80mm / s\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u3002", "note_en": "I have a  Flux3D Beamo 30W CO2 laser.

A customer used their support contract to ask   how to change among the three levels of play in Space Cadet Pinball. My proudest achievement of Windows XP was   fixing the game so it didn\u2019t consume 100% CPU. People keep asking   if it can be brought back.\n One point of contention is over my claim that   I removed Pinball from Windows because I couldn\u2019t get the 64-bit version to work. Retrocomputing enthusiast   NCommander even undertook a   Zapruder-level analysis of all of the 64-bit versions of Windows he could find to prove or disprove my story.\n I was amazed at the level of thoroughness (and the fortitude it required to get those Itanium systems up and running, much less debug them), but there\u2019s one version of 64-bit Windows that NCommander didn\u2019t try out, and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s relevant to the story.\n When the 64-bit Windows project started, there was no Itanium hardware yet. The only way you could run any Itanium code was to run it in a simulator. Booting Windows on an Itanium simulator took forever. Clearly not the development environment you wanted when porting millions of lines of code.\n On the other hand, the Windows team did have access to a lot of copies of another 64-bit processor: The Alpha AXP.\n In 1999, Compaq announced that   it would no longer support Windows on the Alpha AXP, which left a lot of Windows team members with cumbersome paperweights on their desks.\n  \n The Alpha AXP is internally a 64-bit processor. It\u2019s just that 32-bit Windows used only the 32-bit subset.\n  Now, 64-bit Windows on the Alpha AXP would never ship. But the Alpha AXP did have the advantage of  existing in physical form, so the system could finish booting before the heat death of the universe. The assumption is that most of the effort in porting Windows to the Itanium is in the 32-bit to 64-bit transition, and not in dealing with quirks of the specific 64-bit processor you are porting to.\n The assumption was somewhat validated by experience: The 32-bit Windows code base had been ported to many 32-bit processors, with relatively few architecture-specific issues. Once you got a 64-bit version of Windows working for the Alpha AXP, it should be a comparatively small amount of additional work to port it to Itanium. The hard part was going from 32-bit to 64-bit.\n The team set to work, and we had 64-bit Windows running on physical Alpha AXP hardware long before we had any physical Itanium hardware. I could test my 64-bit port on a physical Alpha AXP system to validate that it was successful. And that\u2019s the system that had the broken collision detector.\n NCommander did find a collision detection bug on the Itanium, although that bug was nowhere as severe as the one that existed on the Alpha AXP. My guess is that it had to do with the default rounding mode established by the C runtime library.\n My theory as to what happened is that some time after I removed Pinball from the product, the C runtime team realized that they had a compatibility bug in the way they set the default rounding mode, and they fixed it. Or maybe there was a compiler bug, and the compiler team fixed that. Whatever the problem was, somebody fixed it, and then they went back and re-tested Pinball with this fix, and everything worked great, so they put Pinball back.\n I\u2019m just guessing about what happened afterward because nobody informed me that they had gotten Pinball working and added it back. I just assumed that it was gone forever.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 03:25:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,\u7a7a\u95f4,gaps,cadet", "title": "\u572864\u4f4d\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u586b\u5145\u7a7a\u95f4Cadet Pinball\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a7a\u767d", "title_en": "Filling in some gaps in the story of Space Cadet Pinball on 64-bit Windows", "transed": 1, "url": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220106-00/?p=106122", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "\u7a7a\u95f4", "gaps", "cadet"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f96b034c675a9ba40e7c30ea4bd03d5.png", "infoid": 1072544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u987e\u540d\u601d\u4e49\uff0c\u7535\u6e90\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u4ee5PowerShell\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u684c\u9762\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u5c06\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u8be6\u7ec6/\u6b63\u5e38\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u652f\u6301\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff08\u5728\u67e5\u770b\u5668\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5149\u6807\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5c3d\u529b\u51c6\u5907\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cPhrozen Sasu\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0d\u8bb2\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cPhrozen SASU\u4e0d\u5f97\u8d23\u4efb\u4efb\u4f55\u635f\u5931\u548c/\u6216\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "note_en": "As the name suggests, Power Remote Desktop is a Remote Desktop application entirely coded in PowerShell.\n It does not rely in any existing remote desktop application / protocol to function.
