List explains what makes an idea scalable to a larger audience, size, and impact. Drawing on his experience advising organizations including Uber, Lyft, the Chicago White Sox, and the federal government, List identifies five key signatures of ideas with scaling potential and four secrets entrepreneurs can use to grow their ideas successfully, or, in the book’s parlance, to increase their voltage. In this excerpt from chapter eight, “Quitting Is for Winners,” List shows how opportunity costs and sunken costs sometimes make throwing in the towel a virtue.— Laura Demanski, AM’94</p><p>在一本名为《电压效应：如何让好想法变得伟大》和《伟大想法的规模》（Currency，2022）的新书中，内西卡哥大学经济学家约翰·a·利斯特（John a.List）解释了是什么让一个想法可以扩展到更大的受众、规模和影响力。根据他为优步、Lyft、芝加哥白袜队和联邦政府等组织提供咨询的经验，List确定了具有扩展潜力的想法的五个关键特征和四个秘密，企业家可以利用这些秘密成功地发展他们的想法，或者用书中的说法，增加他们的影响力。在这段摘自第八章“戒烟是为了赢家”的摘录中，这个列表展示了机会成本和沉没成本有时是如何让认输成为一种美德的劳拉·德曼斯基，94岁</p><p>  When I was growing up, all of the men in my family were truck drivers (my grandfather, August Sr., my father, August Jr., and my older brother, August III!), and I had been told that I would be one, too. Yet I dreamed of a different life, even if I didn’t know exactly what that life might look like or where to find it. Golf, however, was a door that opened a whole new horizon of possibilities to me, since I very well might not have gone to college at all had it not been for the sport.</p><p>在我成长的过程中，我家里所有的男人都是卡车司机（我的祖父，老奥古斯特，我的父亲，小奥古斯特，我的哥哥，奥古斯特三世！），有人告诉我，我也会成为其中之一。然而，我梦想着一种不同的生活，即使我不知道那种生活会是什么样子，也不知道在哪里可以找到它。然而，高尔夫是一扇门，为我打开了一个全新的可能性视野，因为如果不是因为这项运动，我很可能根本就没有上过大学。</p><p> By attaining a four-year degree, I would hop up a rung on the socioeconomic ladder and gain access to opportunities withheld from my parents and grandparents. Golf had gotten me this far, so the best way I could imagine prospering was by making it my future career. If I stuck it out and gave the sport my all, was there a chance I could make it as a professional? I believed the answer was yes, though in retrospect I was a victim of my own confirmation bias, conveniently focusing on the tournaments I won while ignoring the empirical evidence of the ones I lost. I had no trouble remembering the good rounds—shooting 32 on the front nine of a prestigious tournament, for instance—but conveniently blocked out the 41 on the back nine that cost me first place. As I packed up my belongings and left my childhood home for the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point, playing on the PGA tour was the dream I clung to. And why shouldn’t I? I believed I could scale my past successes as a golfer into future ones on the PGA tour.</p><p>通过获得四年制学位，我将在社会经济阶梯上获得更高的地位，获得父母和祖父母不给我的机会。高尔夫已经让我走了这么远，所以我能想象的最好的成功方式就是把它作为我未来的职业。如果我坚持到底，全力以赴，我是否有机会成为一名职业选手？我相信答案是肯定的，但回想起来，我是我自己确认偏见的受害者，很方便地专注于我赢得的比赛，而忽略了我输掉的比赛的经验证据。例如，在一场著名的比赛中，我毫不费力地记住了前九局32投的好球，但却轻而易举地将后九局41投的球挡出，这让我失去了第一名的位置。当我收拾好我的东西，离开了我童年的家去威斯康星大学——史蒂文斯艺龙网，在PGA巡回赛上玩，这是我一直坚持的梦想。为什么我不能？我相信我可以在PGA巡回赛中把过去作为高尔夫球手取得的成功扩展到未来。</p><p> But then something surprising happened during my very first year in college that changed the trajectory of my life. About midway through our fall golf season, I had an off weekend, so I returned home to visit my family. When I went out to Cherokee Country Club in Madison, Wisconsin, to hone my game that Friday morning, there happened to be a bunch of college golfers at Cherokee, including some of the older players I used to compete against in high school—golfers like Steve Stricker from the University of Illinois and Jerry Kelly from the University of Hartford, both of whom have subsequently had long and successful PGA careers. I had not seen them for a few years, so I welcomed the chance to find out how my skills compared.</p><p>但在我上大学的第一年，发生了一件令人惊讶的事情，改变了我的人生轨迹。大约在秋季高尔夫赛季的中途，我度过了一个休周末，所以我回家探望家人。当我星期五早上去威斯康星麦迪逊切诺基乡村俱乐部训练我的比赛时，恰巧在切诺基大学有一群高尔夫球手，包括我曾经在伊利诺伊大学和Steve Stricker大学的高中高尔夫球手，像是来自伊利诺伊大学的Jerry Kelly的一些老球员，两人后来都有了长期而成功的PGA职业生涯。我已经好几年没见过他们了，所以我很高兴有机会了解我的技能对比。</p><p> Back in high school, I’d managed to stay competitive, even though I was a few years younger than them. Now, however, something had dramatically changed. As we all worked on the practice range, something felt amiss. Incredibly, they had become Jack Nicklauses, while I was stuck as John List. Yet rather than accept the reality of this fact, I brushed off the initial episode. They were always better ball-strikers than me, I told myself, but I always got them back around the greens. Plus, I reminded myself, this is just practice. It’s the score of the actual game that matters, so let’s see how their scores match up against mine.</p><p>回到高中，我一直努力保持竞争力，尽管我比他们年轻几岁。然而，现在情况发生了巨大的变化。当我们都在练习场工作时，感觉有些不对劲。难以置信的是，他们变成了杰克·尼克劳斯，而我却成了约翰·罗斯特。然而，我并没有接受这一事实的现实，而是无视了最初的情节。我告诉自己，他们总是比我更好的击球手，但我总是让他们回到果岭周围。另外，我提醒自己，这只是练习。重要的是实际比赛的分数，所以让我们看看他们的分数与我的分数如何匹配。</p><p> After they had all teed off, I followed by playing my round with a few friends. Same tees, same course, same weather conditions. The crushing outcome was that both Steve and Jerry scored in the high 60s, as did many of the dozen or so other golfers out with them (including a high schooler named Mario Tiziani, now also a professional golfer), and while I thought I played pretty well, I shot a 75. For those not familiar with golf scoring, at this level that difference was akin to an A+ versus a D.</p><p>他们开球后，我跟着几个朋友一起打球。同样的球座，同样的球场，同样的天气条件。毁灭性的结果是史蒂夫和杰瑞都在60年代的高中阶段得分，其他十几名高尔夫球手（包括高中生马里奥·蒂齐亚尼，现在也是一名职业高尔夫球手）也是如此。虽然我认为自己打得很好，但我还是打出了75分。对于那些不熟悉高尔夫得分的人来说，在这个水平上，这种差异类似于A+和D。</p><p> That night, rather than sleep, I did what any data guy would do: I researched all of their golf scores for the past several years, comparing them to what I had scored on the same courses. I did the same all day Saturday and Sunday. This was not easy work; since there was no internet back then, it took two solid days in the library digging through old local newspapers for data. By the end of that weekend, as I drove back to Stevens Point, sleepless, I came to terms with the fact that no matter how much I cared about golf and practiced it—and no matter what it symbolized for me—I was never going to be good enough to make it onto the PGA Tour, or even come close. I was playing fine for a collegiate golfer, but figuring out how to shave those last several strokes off my score necessary to compete at the highest levels was unfathomable. Suddenly I was unable to delude myself further. Reality had intervened and revealed my pro-golfer aspirations for what they were: a false positive.</p><p>那天晚上，我没有睡觉，而是做了任何数据员都会做的事情：我研究了他们过去几年的所有高尔夫成绩，并将它们与我在同一球场上的得分进行了比较。周六和周日我整天都是这样。这不是一件容易的工作；由于当时没有互联网，图书馆花了整整两天的时间翻阅当地的旧报纸以获取数据。周末结束时，当我驱车返回史蒂文斯角（Stevens Point），不眠之夜（Sleeptless），我终于接受了这样一个事实：无论我多么关心高尔夫，多么练习高尔夫，无论它对我来说象征着什么——我永远都不会有足够的能力参加PGA巡回赛，甚至无法接近。作为一名大学高尔夫球手，我打得很好，但要想弄清楚如何将最后几杆从我的分数中剔除，以达到最高水平，这是一件难以捉摸的事情。突然间，我无法再欺骗自己了。现实已经介入，并揭示了我对职业高尔夫球手的渴望：假阳性。</p><p> My talent had gotten me this far, but as a career, it just didn’t scale. Pursuing it past this point would only lead to a crushing voltage drop and perhaps even more crushing disappointment. So I decided it was time to quit on my dream.</p><p>我的天赋让我走到了这一步，但作为一个职业，它只是没有规模。超过这一点只会导致致命的电压下降，甚至更致命的失望。所以我决定是时候放弃我的梦想了。</p><p> Making this decision wasn’t easy. It went against the values I had learned as a child growing up in small-town Wisconsin, the kingdom of the legendary Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, “Winners never quit and quitters never win.” This was the local culture I was steeped in. I was a product of it, as were my supportive parents, who believed in my golf career and told me to stay resilient and never give up.</p><p>做出这个决定并不容易。这与我小时候在威斯康星州小镇长大时学到的价值观背道而驰。威斯康星州是传奇的绿湾包装工队教练文斯·隆巴迪的王国，他有句名言：“成功者永不放弃，放弃者永不胜利。”这就是我沉浸其中的当地文化。我是它的产物，支持我的父母也是如此，他们相信我的高尔夫事业，并告诉我要保持韧性，永不放弃。</p><p> This wasn’t a uniquely midwestern phenomenon. American culture as a whole tells us that if we refuse to quit, if we just hang on a little longer and give a little more, then all our dreams will come true. This is buttressed by the proliferation of success stories on social media that all seem to inevitably hit the same note: “Thankfully I didn’t quit and persevered through all of the setbacks.” This success should be applauded, but for every one of these feel-good stories, there are likely a hundred thousand people who toil away and never get to the finish line, never get to do the victory lap. Where are the tweets from these people? Who is talking about how they could have accomplished something really great if they’d quit something else twenty years ago and tried an entirely different path? How many lifesaving drugs, innovative new products, and bold policy interventions has our society lost because people refused to quit pursuing unscalable dreams? These are tragic and unwritten stories—unwritten because they have not had the chance to play out in reality, since from birth we are told we shouldn’t quit.</p><p>这不是中西部特有的现象。美国文化作为一个整体告诉我们，如果我们拒绝放弃，如果我们坚持得更久，付出得更多，那么我们所有的梦想都会实现。这一点得到了社交媒体上大量成功故事的支持，这些成功故事似乎都不可避免地达到了同一个目的：“谢天谢地，我没有放弃，在所有的挫折中都坚持了下来。”这一成功应该受到赞扬，但对于每一个感觉良好的故事来说，可能都有十万人在辛苦工作，永远无法到达终点线，永远无法完成胜利圈。这些人的推文在哪里？谁在说，如果他们在20年前放弃了别的东西，尝试了一条完全不同的道路，他们怎么会取得真正伟大的成就呢？因为人们拒绝放弃追求无法实现的梦想，我们的社会失去了多少救命药物、创新的新产品和大胆的政策干预？这些都是悲剧和不成文的故事，不成文是因为它们没有机会在现实中上演，因为从出生起我们就被告知我们不应该放弃。</p><p> But what if I told you that achieving something great often means quitting—that is, giving up a dream, pursuit, or career path that is going nowhere, in exchange for one where you can make a greater contribution?</p><p>但如果我告诉你，成就一件伟大的事情往往意味着放弃——也就是说，放弃一个没有出路的梦想、追求或职业道路，以换取一个你可以做出更大贡献的道路，那会怎么样？</p><p> In my case, once I gave up my dream of professional golfing, I turned my attention to the one thing that I had come to believe I did have a true talent—and passion—for: economics. In 1992, I graduated with an economics degree from UW–Stevens Point and received my doctorate four years later from the University of Wyoming.</p><p>就我而言，一旦我放弃了职业高尔夫的梦想，我就把注意力转向了一件我逐渐相信自己确实有天赋和激情的事情：经济学。1992，我毕业于UW经济学学位-史蒂文斯点，四年后从怀俄明大学获得博士学位。</p><p> After completing my PhD, I applied for 150 tenure-track jobs. I got turned down by 149 of them, yet I wasn’t shaken by this less than enthusiastic embrace from my chosen field. Because unlike golf, economics was an area where I knew I was good enough to make a mark. While I didn’t have a fancy Ivy League degree, the response to my research suggested I had the right kind of mind. So this time I heeded Lombardi’s advice and persisted. I threw myself into the fieldwork that has since defined my career at the one school that wanted me, the University of Central Florida.</p><p>完成博士学位后，我申请了150份终身职位。他们中有149人拒绝了我，但我并没有被我选择的领域中这种不那么热情的拥抱所动摇。因为与高尔夫不同，经济学是一个我知道自己足够优秀的领域，足以让我成名。虽然我没有一个漂亮的常春藤联盟学位，但对我的研究的回应表明我的思维是正确的。所以这次我听从了伦巴第的建议，坚持下去。我投身于田野工作，从此以后，我的职业生涯在我所希望的一所学校——中佛罗里达大学。</p><p> It paid off. In some alternate corner of the multiverse, John A. List is a golf “teaching pro” at a second-rate country club quoting Vince Lombardi to the clients he gives lessons to. Not the worst existence, but not the best, either. Thankfully, in this universe I’m me, constantly feeding my own curiosity with new field experiments and new science. I’ve done a few things I’m proud of, and maybe even helped some people. As a golfer, I simply wouldn’t have made much of an impact—not because economists are inherently more valuable to society than golfers (lots of professional golfers inspire children and contribute to social causes, and club pros do wonderful things as well) but simply because I am better at economics than at golf, which made me more likely to successfully contribute things of social value. Put another way, my skills as an economist were more scalable than my skills as a golfer.</p><p>它得到了回报。在多元宇宙的另一个角落里，约翰·A·李斯特是一家二流乡村俱乐部的高尔夫“教学专家”，他引用文斯·伦巴第的话给客户上课。不是最糟糕的生活，但也不是最好的。谢天谢地，在这个宇宙中，我就是我，不断用新的野外实验和新的科学来满足我自己的好奇心。我做了一些我感到自豪的事情，甚至可能帮助了一些人。作为一名高尔夫球手，我不会产生太大的影响，不是因为经济学家天生比高尔夫球手对社会更有价值（许多职业高尔夫球手激励孩子，为社会事业做出贡献，俱乐部职业球员也做了很棒的事情），而是因为我更擅长经济学而不是高尔夫，这让我更有可能成功地贡献出有社会价值的东西。换句话说，我作为经济学家的技能比我作为高尔夫球手的技能更具可扩展性。</p><p> In cases like these, the best thing you can do is quit. It may be a wrenching decision, but I would argue that getting good at quitting is one of the secrets for scaling successfully. Indeed, I believe that not only do people, companies, and organizations not quit enough, they also don’t quit soon enough.</p><p>在这种情况下，你能做的最好的事情就是辞职。这可能是一个痛苦的决定，但我认为，善于戒烟是成功扩大规模的秘诀之一。事实上，我相信，不仅人们、公司和组织没有足够的退出，他们也没有足够快地退出。</p><p>   It’s perhaps no coincidence that the field I turned to after giving up on my golf career was a discipline that could scientifically explain why I had made the right choice. That explanation can be found in one of the bedrock concepts of economics: opportunity cost, or the gains you miss out on when you choose one option over another. We can think of opportunity cost as an attempt to quantify the path not taken, which often means the path we would have taken if only we’d quit the path we were on. In my case, pursuing a golf career would have cost me the chance to teach economics to eager young minds, publish lots of scientific studies and books, and advise various leaders.</p><p>也许这不是巧合，我在放弃高尔夫职业生涯后转向的球场是一门可以科学地解释为什么我做出了正确选择的学科。这种解释可以在经济学的一个基本概念中找到：机会成本，或者当你选择一个选项而不是另一个选项时，你错过的收益。我们可以把机会成本看作是一种试图量化未走的道路的尝试，这通常意味着如果我们放弃我们所走的道路，我们就会走的道路。就我而言，从事高尔夫职业会让我失去向渴望成功的年轻人教授经济学、出版大量科学研究和书籍以及为各种领导人提供建议的机会。</p><p> I saw a useful example of the dynamics of opportunity cost at work one day when my son Mason, then eight years old and a precociously competitive baseball player, was shopping for a new bat. Mason had saved up $325 and wanted to buy a top-of-the-line baseball bat that he hoped would help him raise his batting average. (Yes, his data scientist dad tracked his stats from his very first at-bat as a five-year-old!) He quickly found two very good options—one for $200, the other for $325. He couldn’t decide between them, so I did what any economist father would do and said, “Mason, think about it like this. If you buy the $200 bat, then that leaves you $125 to also buy a good new Rawlings baseball glove.” He took this suggestion in. Within a minute we were at the cash register with the cheaper bat and a new Rawlings glove.</p><p>有一天，我看到了一个关于工作机会成本动态的有用例子，当时我八岁的儿子梅森是一名早熟的棒球运动员，他正在买一支新球棒。梅森攒了325美元，想买一个顶级棒球棒，希望能帮助他提高击球率。（是的，他的数据科学家父亲从他五岁第一次参加蝙蝠队时就开始追踪他的数据！）他很快找到了两个非常好的选择，一个200美元，另一个325美元。他无法在两者之间做出决定，所以我做了任何经济学家父亲都会做的事情，并说：“梅森，这样想吧。如果你买了200美元的球棒，那么你还可以花125美元买一个好的新罗林斯棒球手套。”他接受了这个建议。不到一分钟，我们就拿着更便宜的球棒和新的罗林斯手套来到收银台。</p><p> Mason had factored opportunity cost into his decision-making. Because he had a finite amount of money to spend, had he opted for the more expensive bat, not only would he have had to shell out $325, but he also would have had to forgo buying the new glove as well.</p><p>梅森在决策中考虑了机会成本。因为他有有限的钱可以花，如果他选择了更昂贵的蝙蝠，他不仅要花325美元，而且还必须放弃购买新手套。</p><p> Sometimes we do such calculations instinctively. But often we don’t stop to consider opportunity cost until both options come into our field of vision, a phenomenon demonstrated by a body of influential psychological research showing that our judgments and preferences tend to be based primarily on information that is explicitly presented. When we make decisions we tend to apply mental shortcuts, or heuristics, that allow us to think fast, which means there is no time for careful opportunity-cost thinking. Relatedly, research on affective forecasting—our ability to predict the emotions we will feel in the future—reveals that judgments about our future well-being are excessively sensitive to current mood, causing us to neglect other relevant factors. In other words, we magnify the importance of the emotions sitting in front of us, which can lead to more impulsive decision-making.</p><p>有时我们本能地做这样的计算。但我们常常不停下来考虑机会成本，直到两种选择进入我们的视野，一个有影响力的心理学研究表明，我们的判断和偏好倾向于主要基于显式的信息。当我们做决定时，我们倾向于使用思维捷径，或启发法，让我们快速思考，这意味着没有时间仔细考虑机会成本。与此相关的是，对情感预测的研究——我们预测未来情绪的能力——揭示了对未来幸福感的判断对当前情绪过于敏感，导致我们忽视了其他相关因素。换句话说，我们放大了摆在我们面前的情绪的重要性，这会导致更冲动的决策。</p><p> When I was a sports card dealer I saw this all the time. Too many times to remember, a buyer would have a hard time choosing between two cards—buying, say, a $250 Ken Griffey rookie card or a $200 A-Rod card—so I would frame the choice as follows: “Would you rather have the Griffey, or the A-Rod card and five packs of Upper Deck cards?” Remarkably, the decision that had seemed so difficult just moments before was suddenly no longer difficult at all: A-Rod and the five packs.</p><p>当我还是一名运动卡经销商时，我一直看到这一点。很多时候，买家很难在两张卡之间做出选择，比如250美元的肯·格里菲新秀卡或200美元的a-Rod卡，所以我会把选择框如下：“你更喜欢格里菲卡，还是a-Rod卡和五包上层卡？”值得注意的是，之前看起来很困难的决定突然变得不再困难：A-Rod和五包。</p><p> Experimental research suggests that policymakers are also vulnerable to the same bias, known as opportunity cost neglect, when evaluating the best programs to fund, causing decision-makers to commit to one program without fully considering others. I have often heard “What benefits can $10 million produce if invested in this policy?” But rarely have I heard “Alternatively, what benefits could the $10 million reap if invested elsewhere?” The business world is subject to this phenomenon, too, though it has more built-in practices to guard against it, since understanding opportunity cost is crucial in a competitive environment. This takes us back to the concept of marginal thinking, which is inseparable from opportunity cost. When resources are limited, if you’re not getting the most out of every last dollar spent, the opportunity cost includes the additional impact your dollars could have had if allocated more effectively.</p><p>实验研究表明，决策者在评估最佳融资项目时，也容易受到同样的偏见，即所谓的机会成本忽视，导致决策者在没有充分考虑其他项目的情况下致力于一个项目。我经常听到“如果在这项政策上投资1000万美元，能带来什么好处？”但我很少听到“或者，如果把1000万美元投资到其他地方，会有什么好处？”商业世界也受到这种现象的影响，尽管它有更多的内在做法来防范这种现象，因为在竞争环境中，了解机会成本至关重要。这让我们回到了边际思维的概念，它与机会成本密不可分。当资源有限时，如果你没有充分利用最后花费的每一美元，机会成本包括如果更有效地分配你的美元可能产生的额外影响。</p><p> All of this is to say that evaluating opportunity costs requires consideration of alternative options that are not explicit components of a decision, like the five packs of Upper Deck cards and Mason’s new baseball glove. But the opportunity cost isn’t always about what money can buy. When we ignore opportunity cost, we often squander that most precious limited resource of all: time.</p><p>所有这些都意味着，评估机会成本需要考虑不是决策明确组成部分的替代方案，比如五包上层卡片和梅森的新棒球手套。但机会成本并不总是钱能买到什么。当我们忽视机会成本时，我们经常浪费最宝贵的有限资源：时间。</p><p> In the same way that when we spend our money on one thing we can’t spend it on another, when we spend our time on one thing we can’t spend it on another. When a company focuses all of their resources on scaling one product, they can’t scale another. When a government scales one public program, they don’t scale another. To implement such endeavors means investing not just money but also thousands of hours of time by the people involved. In this manner, as an organization scales, opportunity costs grow—more money is spent, but so is more time. And time, economically speaking, is money.</p><p>同样，当我们把钱花在一件事上时，我们不能把它花在另一件事上，当我们把时间花在一件事上时，我们不能把它花在另一件事上。当一家公司将所有资源集中在扩展一种产品上时，他们就无法扩展另一种产品。当一个政府扩大一个公共项目时，他们不会扩大另一个。实施这些努力不仅意味着投入资金，还意味着相关人员投入数千小时的时间。通过这种方式，随着组织规模的扩大，机会成本也会增加。投入的资金越多，时间也越多。从经济角度讲，时间就是金钱。</p><p> Ever since Gary Becker [AM’53, PhD’55], the famous Chicago economist, began working on determining the actual value of time, economists have explored various ways to measure this slippery economic entity. At present, economists have managed to estimate the value of our time across different settings, places, and populations. For instance, what is the value of the time a transportation program will give back to citizens if, say, it funds a new rail line that will shorten riders’ commutes? There are numerical estimates that can be made by looking at the value of the productive things people will do with the time they recoup. But the opportunity cost of time isn’t just about money made or lost—it’s about how we spend the tick-tocking of hours endowed to us during our limited time on earth.</p><p>自从芝加哥著名经济学家加里·贝克尔（Gary Becker[AM'53，PhD'55]开始致力于确定时间的实际价值以来，经济学家们一直在探索各种方法来衡量这个不稳定的经济实体。目前，经济学家已经成功地评估了不同环境、不同地点和不同人群的时间价值。例如，如果一个交通项目为一条缩短乘客通勤时间的新铁路线提供资金，那么它将给公民的时间价值是多少？通过观察人们在回收时间内所做的富有成效的事情的价值，可以做出一些数字估计。但是，时间的机会成本不仅与金钱的获得或损失有关，还与我们在地球上有限的时间里如何度过分配给我们的时间有关。</p><p> We want to get the most out of our lives, which is why we don’t like requesting Lyft rides whose wait times feel too long (and why we hate waiting more generally) and are always on the lookout for productivity hacks. We want to maximize what we accomplish with our time and minimize the opportunity costs of time wasted deleting spam emails or standing on a corner waiting for a Lyft to show up.</p><p>我们想从生活中得到最大的收获，这就是为什么我们不喜欢要求等待时间过长的Lyft骑乘（以及为什么我们更普遍地讨厌等待），并且总是在寻找效率黑客。我们希望最大限度地利用时间完成任务，并将删除垃圾邮件或站在角落等待Lyft出现所浪费的时间机会成本降至最低。</p><p> For people and organizations with big, bold ideas they hope to take to scale, opportunity costs are especially important to consider. The more an idea scales, the more time, money, and opportunity can be lost. Moreover, for most people who dream of scaling something they are passionate about, there is also an emotional cost: the fear of disappointment and heartbreak that comes with investing their time—which is to say, their life—in something that doesn’t work out. Think about the scientist who chooses one line of research in the hope of discovering a cure to a disease, or the start-up founder with an idea for a new technology that might revolutionize an industry. Pursuing such objectives requires tremendous sacrifices, the most significant of which is the opportunity costs of paths not taken. This is why it is so devastating when an idea you pour your heart and soul and time into fails to scale. It’s not just voltage you lose. It’s all the other promising opportunities you turned down in the process. The more time you sink into the wrong idea, the more you are misspending life’s most precious resource. But if you quit at the right time (and ignore that sunk cost), then you can move on to scale something else—something with a better shot at success.</p><p>对于那些希望规模宏大、大胆的想法的人和组织来说，机会成本是特别重要的。一个想法规模越大，失去的时间、金钱和机会就越多。此外，对于大多数梦想扩展自己热爱的事物的人来说，还有一个情感代价：将时间——也就是说，他们的生活投入到不可行的事情中，会带来失望和心碎的恐惧。想想那些选择一条研究路线以期找到治愈疾病的方法的科学家，或者一个有可能彻底改变一个行业的新技术想法的初创公司创始人。追求这些目标需要做出巨大牺牲，其中最重要的是没有走上的道路的机会成本。这就是为什么当一个你倾注了全部心血和时间的想法无法扩展时，它是如此具有破坏性。你失去的不仅仅是电压。这是你在这个过程中拒绝的所有其他有希望的机会。你越是陷入错误的想法，你就越是浪费生命中最宝贵的资源。但是，如果你在正确的时间辞职（并且忽略沉没成本），那么你可以继续扩大规模，取得更大的成功。</p><p>  Sometimes you have to leave behind that professional golf career you’ve been dreaming of—by which I mean that idea you dreamed of scaling and changing the world with but which just isn’t performing how you want—in order to shift gears and find a better one. And the sooner you do this, the lower the opportunity cost you’ll pay. Yet giving up at the right moment—before we sacrifice overmuch—doesn’t come naturally to us for the same reason that accurately calculating opportunity cost doesn’t come naturally to baseball card collectors or eight-year-old Little Leaguers. It requires an effort that runs counter to our deep-rooted heuristics and fast way of thinking.
