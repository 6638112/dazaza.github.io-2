Yet onlya very few lifetimes ago things were different in the United States:originality and variety were common currency; our freedom fromregimentation made us the miracle of the world; social classboundaries were relatively easy to cross; our citizenry wasmarvelously confident, inventive, and able to do many thingsindependently, to think for themselves. We were something, all byourselves, as individuals. It only takes about 50 contact hours to transmit basic literacy and mathskills well enough that kids can be self-teachers from then on. The cryfor &#34;basic skills&#34; practice is a smokescreen behind which schools pre-emptthe time of children for twelve years and teach them the six lessons I&#39;vejust taught you. We&#39;ve had a society increasingly under central control in the UnitedStates since just before the Civil War: the lives we lead, the clothes wewear, the food we eat, and the green highway signs we drive by from coastto coast are the products of this central control. So, too, I think, arethe epidemics of drugs, suicide, divorce, violence, cruelty, and thehardening of class into caste in the U.S., products of the dehumanizationof our lives, the lessening of individual and family importance thatcentral control imposes. Without a fully active role in community life you cannot develop into acomplete human being. Aristotle taught that. Surely he was right; lookaround you or look in the mirror: that is the demonstration. &#34;School&#34; is an essential support system for a vision of social engineeringthat condemns most people to be subordinate stones in a pyramid that narrowsto a control point as it ascends. &#34;School&#34; is an artifice which makes sucha pyramidal social order seem inevitable (although such a premise is afundamental betrayal of the American Revolution). In colonial days andthrough the period of the early Republic we had no schools to speak of. Andyet the promise of democracy was beginning to be realized. We turned ourbacks on this promise by bringing to life the ancient dream of Egypt:compulsory training in subordination for everybody. Compulsory schooling was the secret Plato reluctantly transmitted in the Republic when helaid down the plans for total state control of human life. The current debate about whether we should have a national curriculum is phony; we already have one, locked up in the six lessons I&#39;ve told youabout and a few more I&#39;ve spared you. This curriculum produces moral andintellectual paralysis, and no curriculum of content will be sufficient toreverse its bad effects. What is under discussion is a greatirrelevancy. None of this is inevitable, you know. None of it is impregnable tochange. We do have a choice in how we bring up young people; there isno right way. There is no &#34;international competition&#34; that compels ourexistence, difficult as it is to even think about in the face of aconstant media barrage of myth to the contrary. In every importantmaterial respect our nation is self-sufficient. If we gained anon-material philosophy that found meaning where it is genuinely located-- in families, friends, the passage of seasons, in nature, in simpleceremonies and rituals, in curiosity, generosity, compassion, and serviceto others, in a decent independence and privacy -- then we would be trulyself-sufficient. How did these awful places, these &#34;schools&#34;, come about? As we know them, they are a product of the two &#34;Red Scares&#34; of 1848 and 1919, when powerful interests feared a revolution among our industrial poor, and partly they are the result of the revulsion with which old-line families regarded the waves of Celtic, Slavic, and Latin immigration -- and the Catholic religion -- after 1845. And certainly a third contributing cause can be found in the revulsion with which these same families regarded the free movement of Africans through the society after the Civil War. Look again at the six lessons of school. This is training for permanentunderclasses, people who are to be deprived forever of finding the centerof their own special genius. And it is training shaken loose from itsoriginal logic: to regulate the poor. Since the 1920s the growth ofthe well-articulated school bureaucracy, and the less visible growth ofa horde of industries that profit from schooling exactly as it is, haveenlarged schooling&#39;s original grasp to seize the sons and daughters ofthe middle class. Is it any wonder Socrates was outraged at the accusation that he tookmoney to teach? Even then, philosophers saw clearly the inevitabledirection the professionalization of teaching would take, pre-emptingthe teaching function that belongs to all in a healthy community; belongs,indeed, most clearly to yourself, since nobody else cares as much aboutyour destiny. Professional teaching tends to another serious error.It makes things that are inherently easy to learn, like reading, writing,and arithmetic, difficult -- by insisting they be taught by pedagogicalprocedures. With lessons like the ones I teach day after day, is it any wonder we have the national crisis we face today? Young people indifferent to the adult world and to the future; indifferent to almost everything except the diversion of toys and violence? Rich or poor, schoolchildren cannotconcentrate on anything for very long. They have a poor sense of timepast and to come; they are mistrustful of intimacy (like the children ofdivorce they really are); they hate solitude, are cruel, materialistic,dependent, passive, violent, timid in the face of the unexpected, addictedto distraction. All the peripheral tendencies of childhood are magnified to a grotesqueextent by schooling, whose hidden curriculum prevents effectivepersonality development. Indeed, without exploiting the fearfulness,selfishness, and inexperience of children our schools could not surviveat all, nor could I as a certified schoolteacher. &#34;Critical thinking&#34; is a term we hear frequently these days as a form oftraining which will herald a new day in mass schooling. It certainlywill, if it ever happens. No common school that actually dared teach theuse of dialectic, heuristic, and other tools of free minds could last ayear without being torn to pieces. Institutional schoolteachers are destructive to children&#39;s development.Nobody survives the Six-Lesson Curriculum unscathed, not even theinstructors. The method is deeply and profoundly anti-educational.No tinkering will fix it. In one of the great ironies of human affairs,the massive rethinking that schools require would cost so much less thanwe are spending now that it is not likely to happen. First and foremost,the business I am in is a jobs project and a contract-letting agency.We cannot afford to save money, not even to help children. At the pass we&#39;ve come to historically, and after 26 years of teaching,I must conclude that one of the only alternatives on the horizon for mostfamilies is to teach their own children at home. Small, de-institutionalized schools are another. Some form of free-market systemfor public schooling is the likeliest place to look for answers. But thenear impossibility of these things for the shattered families of the poor,and for too many on the fringes of the economic middle class, foretellthat the disaster of Six-Lesson Schools is likely to continue. After an adult lifetime spent in teaching school I believe the method ofschooling is the only real content it has. Don&#39;t be fooled into thinkingthat good curricula or good equipment or good teachers are the criticaldeterminants of your son and daughter&#39;s schooltime. All the pathologieswe&#39;ve considered come about in large measure because the lessons of schoolprevent children from keeping important appointments with themselves andtheir families, to learn lessons in self-motivation, perseverance,self-reliance, courage, dignity and love -- and, of course, lessons inservice to others, which are among the key lessons of home life. Thirty years ago these things could still be learned in the time leftafter school. But television has eaten most of that time, and acombination of television and the stresses peculiar to two-income orsingle-parent families have swallowed up most of what used to be familytime. Our kids have no time left to grow up fully human, and onlythin-soil wastelands to do it in. A future is rushing down upon our culture which will insist that all of us learn the wisdom of non-material experience; this future will demand, as the price of survival, that we follow a pace of natural life economical in material cost. These lessons cannot be learned in schools as they are. School is like starting life with a 12-year jail sentence in which bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned. I teach school and win awards doing it.
