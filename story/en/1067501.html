Basically, every platform is looking for a way to let creators charge their audiences directly, while taking a cut along the way.</p><p> 如果您一直在倾听解码或阅读边缘，您就知道支付创作者的想法直接在像Twitter，Instagram和Facebook这样的社交平台上弹出，以及一系列新的初创公司，如家食。基本上，每个平台都在寻找一种方法来让创造者直接向观众收费，同时沿途削减。</p><p> The buzzword for all of this is the “creator economy,” which is just an overloaded way of saying that individual creatives can become businesses with multiple lines of revenue and a direct relationship with their audiences, instead of relying on a platform’s advertising model.</p><p> 所有这一切的流行语都是“创作者经济”，这只是一种超载的方式，说个人的创造者可以成为具有多种收入的企业，与他们的观众直接关系，而不是依赖平台的广告模型。</p><p> Patreon’s been supporting that economy for eight years now and has grown into a formidable business because of it,  tripling its valuation to $4 billion just this past April. Several weeks after securing the investments that earned Patreon its new valuation, Jack announced the company was laying off 36 people from Patreon’s product and design team to refocus on a new product approach.</p><p> Patreon一直在支持经济八年，因为它已经增添了一个强大的业务，这是一个强大的业务，将其估值增长到4月份的40亿美元。杰克宣布了赢得帕勒顿新估值的投资后几周，该公司正在从帕勒顿的产品和设计团队汇出36人，以重新聚焦新产品方法。</p><p> As a musician, Jack has specific ideas of what Patreon can and should provide, and a specific vision of where the company fits. His vision is focused on offering a way to support creatives who work across multiple platforms, and creating diverse streams of revenue instead of being tied to a single platform. It came up right away in our talk — Jack refers to Patreon’s business model as “membership,” which we took some time to figure out.</p><p> 作为一个音乐家，杰克对Patreon可以并且应该提供的具体想法以及公司所适合的特定愿景。他的愿景专注于提供一种支持跨多个平台工作的创造者，并创造多元化的收入而不是与单一平台相关联。它立即在我们的谈话中出现 - 杰克是指帕勒顿的商业模式是“会员资格”，我们花了一些时间来弄清楚。</p><p> That also comes with a unique relationship to Apple and the App Store. Apple wants a 30 percent cut of every digital purchase on the iPhone, and Patreon lets creators sell things — but it doesn’t have to pay the cut, while other newer platforms appear to be stuck paying the tax. I asked Jack if he worries about an App Store crackdown, and how creators should feel about Apple and the App Store. If you ask me, the fight between Apple and creators is about to get really messy, and no one’s really ready for it. Jack’s answers here were pretty illuminating.</p><p> 这也包含与Apple和App Store的独特关系。 Apple希望在iPhone上每次数字购买的30％，而Patreon让创作者销售东西 - 但它不必支付削减，而其他较新平台似乎陷入税款。如果他担心App Store镇压，我问杰克，以及创造者如何感受Apple和App Store。如果你问我，苹果和创造者之间的斗争即将变得非常混乱，而且没有人真正为此做好准备。杰克的答案这里是漂亮的照明。</p><p>  It feels like the words “creator economy” come up in almost every conversation I have lately. You’re a recording artist yourself. You’ve seen this entire movement grow into the monster it is now — you started Patreon in 2013. It’s effectively a platform that allows people to pay creators directly.</p><p>  感觉就像“创造者经济”那样在我最近的谈话中出现。你是一位录音艺术家。你已经看到整个运动成长到怪物中它现在 - 你在2013年开始了帕勒顿。它有效地是一个允许人们直接支付创造者的平台。 </p><p> That’s right. We are a membership platform. We allow folks to have subscription pledges to creators, in exchange for exclusive content, community, and stuff like that.</p><p>这是正确的。我们是会员平台。我们允许人们向创造者订阅承诺，以换取独家内容，社区和类似的东西。</p><p> I want to dig in on why specifically you call it a membership platform. Basically, you’re transferring money from people who like things to people who make things, which is important. You’re very successful [at it] — I just read in   the   Wall Street Journal  that in April you raised another $155 million in funding. That tripled the value of Patreon to $4 billion.</p><p> 我想挖掘为什么特别是你称之为会员平台。基本上，你正在将钱从那些像那些成为一个重要的人那样转移钱。你非常成功[它]  - 我刚刚在华尔街日记中读过，四月你在筹集了155亿美元的资金。这将Patreon的价值增长到40亿美元。</p><p> That’s quite a journey over the past eight years to go from startup, to $4 billion valuation in a world where everyone is trying to compete in the creator space. Give me a sense of that ride and where you think things are now.</p><p> 在过去的八年里，从初学到初创公司的旅程，到了一个每个人都试图在创造空间竞争的世界中估价为40亿美元。让我有一种骑行，你认为现在的东西。</p><p> In many ways, I’m not surprised that the world is waking up to this.</p><p> 在许多方面，我并不感到惊讶世界正在唤醒这个问题。</p><p> I remember this feeling, in 2012, I had spent three months working on this music video. I poured my savings account into the video — I spent 10 grand on it. I maxed out two credit cards. I was taking daily trips to Home Depot, swiping my credit card, getting supplies for this music video. I was listening to a lot of electronic music at the time. I’d released this EP and I wanted to make a video with these robots. And I built a replica of the Millennium Falcon cockpit in my studio. I had worked so hard on this video. I killed myself for three months to do this, spent so much money, and gave it everything I had.</p><p> 我记得这一感觉，在2012年，我花了三个月在这个音乐视频上工作。我把储蓄账户倒入了视频中 - 我花了10次盛大。我最多消耗了两张信用卡。我正在每天旅行到家居仓库，刷卡我的信用卡，为此音乐视频提供供应。我当时正在听大量的电子音乐。我发布了这个EP，我想用这些机器人制作一个视频。我在工作室里建造了千年猎鹰驾驶舱的复制品。我在这个视频中努力工作。我杀了三个月来做到这一点，花了这么多钱，并给了它我所拥有的一切。</p><p>  I remember this feeling the night before upload, where I realized, I’m going to put this video on YouTube, it’s going to get a million views, because that’s what my videos would get at a time when I uploaded them, and my paycheck for that is going to be like $160 from YouTube. I remember thinking, “How the fuck is this still possible?”</p><p>  我记得上传前的那个夜晚的感觉，我意识到，我要把这个视频放在YouTube上，它会得到一百万个景观，因为这就是我上传他们的视频的时间，以及我的薪水因为这将是YouTube的160美元。我记得思考，“他妈的如何仍然是可能的？”</p><p> What world are we in, where creative people are pouring their hearts out, uploading stuff to the internet, getting millions of views — this is not like the starving artists problem. A million people are seeing this. Ten football stadiums full of humans are about to watch this thing that I made. Thousands of comments and excitement and passion and energy from the community. And I’m going to get paid $160 for this? What world is this? And how is everybody not screaming about this problem right now? It felt so obvious.</p><p> 我们在哪个世界，创意人们正在倾注他们的心脏，将东西上传到互联网，获得数百万次观点 - 这不像挨饿的艺术家问题。一百万人看到了这一点。十大充满人类的足球场即将观看我所做的事情。来自社区的成千上万的评论和激情和激情和能量。我要为此获得160美元？这是什么世界？现在每个人都没有尖叫着这个问题？它感觉很明显。 </p><p> I guess that’s why it doesn’t feel like a surprise to me now. I’m so grateful. I’m so glad that the rest of the world is waking up to this problem. I think the next decade is going to be awesome for creative people because they’re going to have options. They’re going to have the ability to generate revenue in whatever way they want. There’s going to be a bunch of companies building for them. Finally, the world seems to be waking up.</p><p>我猜这就是为什么它现在不像我惊讶。我很感激。我很高兴世界其他地方正在唤醒这个问题。我认为未来十年将为创意人员令人敬畏，因为他们会有选择。他们将有能力以任何想要的方式产生收入。这将是一堆公司为他们建造。最后，世界似乎正在​​醒来。</p><p>  Let me put that in an even longer timeframe, for context. In the ’90s, at the height of the CD era, a band would release a CD. A handful of radio stations and MTV would promote it. A lot of people would buy the CD, and the band would get rich. They made money selling the music directly. And if they monetized their work in other ways, like sync rights or movie licensing or whatever, there would actually be a conversation about authenticity and selling out.</p><p>  让我把它放在一个更长的时间范围内，以获取上下文。在90年代，在CD时代的高度，频带将释放CD。少数广播电台和MTV会促进它。很多人都会买到CD，乐队会致富。他们直接销售音乐。如果他们以其他方式通过其他方式将其工作中的工作，如同步权利或电影许可或其他任何情况，那么实际上就是关于真实性和卖出的对话。</p><p>   One of the reasons that’s gone is no one makes money selling the [music] itself anymore. You more or less give that away for free, or for $160 on YouTube. And then you’ve got to find all these other revenue streams around your work.</p><p>   一个人走了的原因之一，没有人可以再销售[音乐]。您或多或少地为您提供免费的，或以160美元的YouTube为您提供。然后，您必须在您的工作中找到所有这些其他收入流。</p><p> If we’re going back to the ’90s, let’s go all the way back. Let’s keep going.</p><p> 如果我们回到90年代，让我们一路走回。我们继续吧。</p><p> For thousands of years, the way the arts were funded globally was wealthy people or institutions were like, “I enjoy what you make. Here’s a bag of coins, go make more of that stuff, and let me know when it’s done.”</p><p> 几千年来，艺术被全球资助的方式是富裕的人或机构就像，“我喜欢你所做的一切。这是一袋硬币，去做更多的东西，让我知道什么时候完成了。“</p><p> And this sort of patronage model was the way that art was funded for literally thousands of [years]. Basically all the art we know in history books, the business model for that art was not unit sales. It was patronage. It was a person who made great stuff. And then an institution, a religious institution, a government, a wealthy individual, would pay that person to go make more of that. You name it, whether it’s the Sistine Chapel or the David or whatever, that art was funded through that business model. Those artists made money through that business model.</p><p> 这种惠顾模型是艺术为数千人提供资金的方式的方式。基本上我们在历史书中知道的所有艺术品，这艺术的商业模式不是单位销售。这是惠顾。这是一个做出很好的人。然后一个机构，宗教机构，政府，一个富有的个人，将支付该人更加努力。你说出它，无论是锡斯汀教堂还是大卫或任何东西，那种艺术由该商业模式资助。这些艺术家通过该商业模式赚钱。</p><p> Then the 1900s rolled around — the late 1800s, to right around the turn of the century. Essentially what happened was humans figured out how to record what would otherwise be ephemeral art onto physical objects. We figured out how to record light onto celluloid. We figured out how to record sound onto wax cylinders. That replaced, eventually, the business model of patronage, with unit sales being the primary revenue mechanism for artists.</p><p> 然后，1900年代遍布了19世纪末，到了世纪之交。本质上是人类弄清楚如何记录在物理物体上的季节性艺术。我们弄清楚了如何将光线记录到纤维素上。我们弄清楚如何在蜡缸上录制声音。替换，最终是惠顾的商业模式，单位销售是艺术家的主要收入机制。 </p><p> Starting in the 1900s, billions of dollars of infrastructure basically evolves — whether it’s jewel case manufacturers or trucking companies or brick-and-mortar retail — all this infrastructure evolved to basically help artists put their art on a physical object and then ship that physical object around the world to consumers who would purchase it and then enjoy the art. That became the primary business model for art and artists — whether they’re creating video or audio, music, talk, whatever it is — for a hundred years.</p><p>从19世纪开始，数十亿美元的基础设施基本上发展 - 无论是珠宝盒制造商还是货运公司或砂浆零售 - 所有这些基础架构都在发展到基本上帮助艺术家将他们的艺术放在物理对象上，然后发货向世界各地的消费者购买，然后享受艺术。这成为艺术家和艺术家的主要商业模式 - 无论是创建视频还是音频，音乐，谈论，无论是什么 - 百年。</p><p> At which point, the internet hit and scarcity disappears. Unit sales disappear as a business model. And suddenly everyone’s running around with their hair on fire, trying to figure out how to get creators to make money again.</p><p> 在哪一点，互联网击中和稀缺消失。单位销售作为商业模式消失。突然间，每个人都在跑去跑去火上浇油，试图弄清楚如何让创造者再次赚钱。</p><p> We’re right now in that time where I think humans are realizing [that] when we built the first version of the web, we wiped out a hundred years and billions of dollars of infrastructure to be the financial mechanism for artists to make money. And that needs to be rebuilt now in a digital-first age. That’s the place in history where I think humans are, with regard to creative people making money.</p><p> 我们现在在那个时候，我认为人类正在实现[那]当我们建立了第一版网络时，我们擦掉了一百年和数十亿美元的基础设施，以成为艺术家赚钱的财务机制。现在需要在数字第一时期重建。这就是历史上的地方，我认为人类是赚钱的创造性的人。</p><p> You described [Patreon] as a membership model, which is fascinating. Every one of the models you’ve described has huge inherent trade-offs. The church and some rich people are going to fund all art, is, like, the ultimate gatekeeper trade-off. A bunch of record labels and MTV executives funding all music had a huge set of trade-offs — MTV didn’t play rap music for the longest time.</p><p> 你描述了[Patreon]作为一个会员模型，这是令人着迷的。您所描述的每一个模型都具有巨大的固有权衡。教会和一些富人正在为所有艺术提供资金，就像是终极的守门人权衡。一堆记录标签和MTV高管资助所有音乐都有一系列巨大的权衡 -  MTV在最长的时间内没有发挥Rap音乐。</p><p> The internet removed that gatekeeping ability, but it also removed the underlying economic model. Patreon did not go back to unit sales; you’re calling it membership. I want to know: why are you calling it membership?</p><p> 互联网删除了该守望能力，但它也取消了潜在的经济模式。帕勒顿没有回到单位销售;你正在称之为会员资格。我想知道：你为什么要称之为会员资格？</p><p> I think that a really important insight is that all of these models have trade-offs. In a perfect world, art and commerce, I think, could be in vacuums and coexist in full purity. But the truth is, if you want to be a professional artist, [you’re] figuring out how to create a business model around your art.</p><p> 我认为这是一个非常重要的见解是，所有这些模型都有权衡。在一个完美的世界，艺术和商业中，我认为，可以在充分纯度的真空和共存。但事实是，如果你想成为一名专业艺术家，[你是]如何弄清楚如何在你的艺术周围创建一个商业模式。</p><p> Even with unit sales, there were certain inherent pressures of that overlap between art and commerce. Like a band goes through the classic thing: okay, there’s our first record. The second record, there’s a lot of pressure there. We want to sell a lot of copies of that second record. We want to get on Billboard charts. How do you do that? Well, here’s the big new sounds that are coming out.</p><p> 即使有单位销售，艺术与商业之间的重叠具有一定的固有压力。就像一个乐队经过经典的事情：好的，有我们的第一个记录。第二次记录，那里有很多压力。我们想销售那次第二次记录的大量副本。我们想要进入广告牌图表。你是怎样做的？好吧，这是出来的新声音。 </p><p> [It’s] not just bands. Artists have always had that pressure — or rather, it’s the eternal question that artists ask themselves, “Am I doing this for me, or am I doing this for my audience?” And I think if you involve commerce in any way with your art, then you start to grapple with those trade-offs, as an artist. So I agree. I don’t think those trade-offs go away with a membership model, or with a unit sales model, or even with a patronage model.</p><p>[它]不仅仅是乐队。艺术家始终有压力 - 或者相反，这是艺术家问自己的永恒问题，“我为我这样做，还是我为观众这样做了？”我认为如果您以任何方式与您的艺术涉及商业，那么您就会以艺术家为那些权衡的权衡努力。所以我同意。我不认为这些权衡与会员模型，或使用单位销售模型，甚至与惠顾模型一起消失。</p><p>  Membership is a new category of essentially a business line for creators, where they can make subscription revenue from their most important fans, in exchange for benefits of membership. Things like early access to content, exclusive content, community, extra spaces, where they get to be a part of a group of people that are talking about a certain subject.</p><p>  成员资格是一个新的类别，基本上是创造者的业务线，他们可以从最重要的球迷中取得订阅收入，以换取会员资格的利益。早期访问内容，独家内容，社区，额外空间，在那里他们成为一群正在谈论某个主题的人的一部分。</p><p> For me and my bands, Scary Pockets and Pomplamoose, some of our membership benefits are that we have a patron-only Discord and patron-only Discord events, where our singers will come in and they’ll play their favorite music for our members. And members get to hang out on Zoom with me, and my Scary Pockets co-founder, and singers, and listen to the band play music and talk about music, and people kind of get to have a little digital Zoom party together. And a few hundred people show up. It’s a really fun thing.</p><p> 对我和我的乐队，可怕的口袋和Pomplamoose，我们的一些会员福利是我们有一个借赞的不和谐，唯一的不和谐的事件，我们的歌手将进来，他们会为我们的会员发挥他们最喜欢的音乐。成员可以随身享受缩放，以及我可怕的口袋联合创始人，歌手，并倾听乐队播放音乐并谈论音乐，人们有点可以一起获得一点数码变焦派对。还有几百人出现。这是一件非常有趣的事情。</p><p> That’s an example of exclusive content community for members. So membership is this stronger connection that an artist has with their most important fans that really revolves around more stuff that they’re making, more art that they’re making, and then this sort of community of those members coming together and hanging out with each other.</p><p> 这是成员的独家内容社区的一个例子。所以成员资格是这种更强大的联系，艺术家拥有他们最重要的粉丝，真正围绕他们所做的更多东西，更多的艺术是他们所做的，然后这些成员的社区聚集在一起并闲逛彼此。</p><p> I want to dive into that, because the unit sales model is based on releasing a CD — to stay with the music example — and then hopefully a million people go out and buy it. Hopefully the artists have negotiated a good record company contract, and they will get a bunch of revenue from sales.</p><p> 我想潜入其中，因为单位销售模式是基于发布CD  - 与音乐榜样保持 - 然后希望一百万人出去购买。希望艺术家谈判了一个良好的记录公司合同，他们将获得一堆销售收入。</p><p> Membership sounds like there is no transaction. I’m just handing over money and hoping that you do cool stuff.</p><p> 成员资格听起来没有交易。我只是交出金钱，希望你能做酷的东西。</p><p> That’s a really good point. The way I would describe it is, where a unit sale is, “you made something, and I want that thing,” membership is, “I believe in you as an artist, I think you’re going to keep making cool things. I want to be a part of that journey of you as an artist.”</p><p> 这是一个非常好的观点。我将描述它的方式是，单位销售是，“你做了一些东西，我想要那件事，”会员资格“，”我相信你作为艺术家，我想你会继续酷的事情。我想成为你作为艺术家旅程的一部分。“ </p><p> It’s more of a belief in the future of that person and the things that they will make. It’s more of a commitment to that artist, that you want to be a part of their ongoing creative expression. It is still somewhat transactional because members have benefits and they’re paying for exclusive content and exclusive experiences. So there is a transactional component of it, but it is not purely transactional. And that separates it from the business model of unit sales, for sure.</p><p>它更像是对那个人的未来和他们将要做的事情的信念。这更像是对那位艺术家的承诺，你想成为他们正在进行的创造性表达的一部分。它仍然有些交易，因为成员有福利，他们正在为独家内容和独家体验付出代价。所以它有一个事务组成部分，但它不是纯粹的交易。并肯定地将其与单位销售的商业模式分开。</p><p> We’re up in the clouds. Let’s get down on the ground.</p><p> 我们在云中。让我们走下去。</p><p> Every platform has dynamics; every platform has best practices. At the end of the day, some people on Patreon are more successful than others. And some people have strategies to be successful on Patreon. What are the brass-tacks strategies to be successful on Patreon?</p><p> 每个平台都有动态;每个平台都有最好的实践。在一天结束时，Patreon的一些人比其他人更成功。有些人在帕勒顿有策略。帕勒顿在彭罗斯队的策略是什么？</p><p>  Membership is about that stronger relationship between a creator and their most important fans and the belief in that creator and their ongoing artistic expression. The creators who do best are the creators who deeply love their fans and whose fans deeply love them back if there’s a really strong connection. We find this is true with podcasters, with video creators, and especially with a lot of web comics.</p><p>  成员资格是创造者与最重要的粉丝之间的更强烈的关系以及对该创造者及其持续的艺术表达的信念。最能做的创造者是深深爱他们的粉丝的创造者，如果有一个非常强烈的联系，粉丝深深地爱他们。我们发现这是真实的，播放器，视频创建者，特别是在很多网络漫画中。</p><p>  I’ll give you some hard and fast leading indicators of successful creators on Patreon. If you have a lot of subscribers, say, or followers, that is less predictive of your success than your daily or weekly engaged fans. If, when you put something out, a lot of your fans listen to it, watch it, review it, read it, etc., that is more predictive of your success on Patreon, than, say, the sheer volume of subscribers that you have. That’s one thing.</p><p>  我会在帕勒顿给你一些成功创造者的一些艰难和快速的领先指标。如果您有很多订阅者，请或追随者，这比您的每日或每周参与的粉丝更少预测您的成功。如果，当你把东西放出来时，很多你的粉丝听它，看着它，审查它，阅读它等等，更能预测你对帕勒顿的成功，而不是说，你的用户庞大的投资者有。这是一件事。</p><p> [The] second thing is, if you’re the kind of creator who involves your fans, and you do a T-shirt design contest, when it comes time to make merch, and you’re answering emails, and you do DMs on Twitter, and you’re there with your community. If you’re a really good community manager, that’s highly predictive of your success on Patreon.</p><p> [这个]第二件事是，如果你是涉及你的粉丝的那种创造者，而且你做了一个T恤设计比赛，当它是时候制作Merch，你正在接听电子邮件，你做DMS Twitter，你和你的社区在一起。如果您是一个非常好的社区经理，那么对帕勒顿的成功非常高兴。</p><p> If you offer exclusive pieces of content, it is highly predictive of your success on Patreon. If you have bonus episodes, the podcasters that we’ve seen do best, do the freebie 30-minute thing to be out in the ecosystem and find a new audience. But then they do the hourlong, deep dive for their members only, and it drives a ton of conversion. We saw that when we added exclusive content to the creator page a couple of years ago — it literally doubled conversion rates from a logged-out fan to member.</p><p> 如果您提供独家内容，则高度预测您在Patreon的成功。如果您有奖金剧集，那么我们看到最好的播放者，可以在生态系统中进行30分钟的服务，找到一项新的观众。但是，他们只为他们的成员做了一个小小的潜水，它推动了大量的转换。我们看到，当我们在几年前为创建者添加了独占内容时 - 它将对成员的记录粉丝的转换率加倍。 </p><p> Those are some of the things: good exclusive content, good engaged creators that love their audience and whose audience loves them back. I think are two of the main things.</p><p>那些是一些事情：良好的独家内容，良好的有关的创造者，喜欢他们的观众，他们的观众爱他们。我想是两个主要的东西。</p><p> Let me be really reductive. It sounds like what you’re saying is: do a lot of stuff people like.</p><p> 让我真的还原。听起来你所说的是：做很多人喜欢的东西。</p><p>  When we’re talking about art and commerce and the collision between the two, making a lot of things that people like — it’s still kind of always the formula. I’m curious if you think membership has actually altered the dynamics of that formula.</p><p>  当我们谈论艺术和商业和两者之间的碰撞时，让很多人喜欢的东西 - 它仍然是始终是公式。如果您认为会员资格实际上改变了该公式的动态，我很好奇。</p><p> Well, I’ll tell you a story. I was asking this studio, what the best merch was for creators, because they were experimenting with creator merch and I was trying to figure out: what is predictive of a creator’s success with a merchandise line?</p><p> 好吧，我会告诉你一个故事。我问这个工作室，最好的Merch是创造者的，因为他们正在尝试创造商Merch，我试图弄清楚：预测创造者的成功与商品线是什么？</p><p> And their answer was, the creator has to love the thing that they’re making. So I would say the answer is a little similar for your analysis here. If you just do stuff that other people will like, I actually don’t think you’re going to be that successful as a creator. It’s got to come from your heart. It has to be a real thing that you yourself love. Otherwise, it’s too hard to be a creator. You’ll give up. I think it really is the overlap of things that light you up as a creative person and things that resonate with your audience.</p><p> 他们的答案是，创造者必须爱他们所做的事情。所以我会说答案是你这里的分析一点相似。如果你只是做其他人想要的东西，我实际上并不认为你会作为创造者成功。它必须来自你的心。它必须是你自己喜欢的真实事物。否则，这太难成为创造者。你会放弃。我认为它真的是将你作为一个创造性的人和与观众共鸣的东西的重叠。</p><p> “If you just do stuff that other people will like, I actually don’t think you’re going to be that successful as a creator”</p><p> “如果你只是做了其他人喜欢的东西，我实际上并不认为你会作为一个创造者那么成功”</p><p> Is Patreon a solution to supply and demand and traditional economic principles? I don’t think so. There are still markets and market forces that are at play. It’s still commerce, and Patreon does not solve that problem. What Patreon solves is, “I need a new revenue line for myself. I’m making $160 in ad revenue, and I want to grow a team and build a business and be a professional creator.” Patreon allows [you] to do that.</p><p> Patreon是提供提供和需求和传统经济原则的解决方案吗？我不这么认为。仍有市场和市场力量。它仍然是商业，帕勒顿并没有解决这个问题。 Patreon解决了，“我需要一个新的收入线。我在广告收入中赚了160美元，我想发展一支球队并建立一个企业并成为一个专业的创造者。“ Patreon允许[你]这样做。 </p><p> How many people on Patreon are earning a full-time salary or something equivalent to it?</p><p>Patreon上有多少人赚取全日制薪水或相当于它的东西？</p><p> I think the last number that we released is around 250,000 creators making money, and we actually don’t have data on how many creators are full-time creators. I don’t know that.</p><p> 我认为我们发布的最后一个数字大约是250,000名创作者赚钱，我们实际上没有数据有多少创造者是全职创作者。我不知道。</p><p> For my band, Scary Pockets, about a third of our revenue is membership, and we’re starting to see more and more creators whose business looks about like that, where a third to a half, sometimes more, of a creator’s income is coming from this membership line of business. It’s a solid, recurring, reliable line of business that creators can use to basically grow their income by 50 percent, if they’re just doing ads and streaming or something like that.</p><p> 对于我的乐队，大约三分之一的收入是会员资格，我们开始看到越来越多的创造者，他们的业务看起来像那样，其中三分之一到一半，有时更多，创造者的收入即将到来从这个会员资格的业务系列。这是一个坚实的，经常性，可靠的业务，创造者可以用来将他们的收入基本上增长50％，如果他们只是做广告和流媒体或类似的东西。</p><p> Let me put that in contrast to the new generation of creator platforms — I’ll pick on Substack. We had   Chris Best, the CEO of Substack, on   Decoder  a couple months ago. A lot of writers are quitting their jobs and going to Substack, and that is their full-time job. In some cases, they’re making a lot of money, sometimes much more than they made at their full-time jobs. It seems like with Patreon, that’s not quite as direct of a conversion from one thing to the other.</p><p> 让我与新一代创作者平台相反 - 我会选择家具。几个月前，我们有克里斯·最好的家庭首席执行官，在解码器上。很多作家正在退出他们的工作并进入时尚，这是他们的全职工作。在某些情况下，他们正在赚很多钱，有时比他们在全职工作中的更多资金。看起来帕勒顿，这并不像对另一件事的转换一样。</p><p> I actually think it is pretty similar. The main difference is that — in the case of Substack — many creators did not have a full-time job as a creator employed by another company. Media companies employ thousands and thousands of writers, and they can leave that job and go to Substack or Patreon. In the case of a lot of internet creators, they were not previously employed by a big institution that was paying them a salary. So these are new revenue lines for these creators.</p><p> 我实际上认为它很相似。主要区别在于 - 在家食的情况下，许多创造者没有全职工作作为另一家公司雇用的创造者。媒体公司雇用了数千和成千上万的作家，他们可以离开那份工作并转到别人或帕勒顿。在很多互联网创造者的情况下，他们以前没有被一项薪水支付的大型机构雇用。所以这些是这些创造者的新收入线。</p><p> “There are creators who are building small-business creative media companies, which were not a thing 10 years ago”</p><p> “有创造者正在建立小型企业创意媒体公司，这不是10年前的东西”</p><p> I’d say that’s one main difference. But in terms of the dynamic of people being able to quit their jobs and make a living on Patreon, absolutely. We’re seeing that in droves. We’re seeing people who are becoming full-time creators. They’re doing YouTube. They’re doing podcasts, and they’re doing whatever it is not just as a full-time job, but they’re building media companies. We see creators who are leasing office space and hiring teams.</p><p> 我会说这是一个主要区别。但是，对于能够戒掉工作并谋生于帕勒顿的人们来说，就可以了解。我们看到了拖车。我们看到了成为全日制创作者的人。他们正在做youtube。他们正在做播客，他们正在做什么不仅仅是一个全职工作，而是他们正在建立媒体公司。我们看到租赁办公空间和招聘团队的创造者。 </p><p> I was telling a story yesterday about  True Crime Obsessed. We were showing pictures of their office space at our all-hands [meeting]. There are creators who are building essentially what we’re calling small-business creative media companies, which were not a thing 10 years ago.</p><p>我昨天讲述了一个故事，关于真正的罪行痴迷。我们在全手中显示了他们的办公空间的照片[会议]。有创造者基本上建立了我们称之为小型企业创意媒体公司，这不是10年前的事情。</p><p> There’s a lot of risk in quitting your job, whether it’s your job in media or your job doing something else, and then going to be an independent creator or starting a small business. You’ve got to even out your cash flow. You’ve got to get health insurance. Substack will give people advances. They will pay for health insurance in some cases. They’re running into some questions about who gets those offers and who doesn’t. I think that’s totally fair, but they’re doing it. They’re basically lowering the risk involved.</p><p> 戒掉你的工作有很多风险，无论是你在媒体还是做其他事情的工作，然后是一个独立的创造者或开始小企业。你已经甚至超过了现金流。你必须得到健康保险。家用会让人们提出进展。他们将在某些情况下支付健康保险。他们遇到了一些关于谁获得这些优惠的问题，谁没有。我认为这完全是公平的，但他们正在这样做。他们基本上降低了涉及的风险。</p><p> Patreon has done some of that stuff in the past. I have a quote here that says you want to be a long-term   infrastructure provider for independent creators . Is that still the plan?</p><p> Patreon过去已经完成了一些这些东西。在这里，我有一个引用，说你想成为一个独立创作者的长期基础设施提供商。这仍然是这个计划吗？</p><p> Absolutely. We’ve talked a lot about the past so far, but when I think about the future — and I’m an optimist, so maybe take everything I say with a grain of salt — but I am opt</p><p> 绝对地。到目前为止，我们已经谈到了很多关于过去的事情，但是当我想到未来 - 而且我是一个乐观主义者，所以也许拿走了一粒盐的一切 - 但我是选择</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/22543655/patreon-ceo-decoder-interview-jack-conte?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/22543655/patreon-ceo-decoder-interview-jack-conte?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/例外/">#例外</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/创造者/">#创造者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
