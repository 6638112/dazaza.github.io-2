Creator Kevin Modzelewski tells TechRepublic where the project is heading next.\n  When Kevin Modzelewski and his colleagues at Dropbox set out to create Pyston in 2014, they had a very simple objective: to lower the costs of running Python code on Dropbox&#39;s servers, by making the code itself faster.\n &#34;We were growing exponentially, so our server cost was growing exponentially,&#34; Modzelewski tells TechRepublic. &#34;If we could get Python running faster, we would spend less money running Python.&#34;\n    The original cost reduction initiative  at Dropbox snowballed into a bigger project for Modzelewski when the company moved away from    Python  in 2017 and cancelled the Pyston project.\n He had realized while working on the language that there was a strong demand for faster Python among the developer community, and while there were plenty of tools around for improving the performance in smaller applications, there were none designed for big, business logic-type applications such as Dropbox.\n &#34;There&#39;s a lot of tools out there for helping you run Python faster, but there weren&#39;t any that were a good fit for Dropbox&#39;s use case,&#34; says Modzelewski.\n &#34;This was an area of the Python market where a lot of money was being spent, but not very many tools were being developed for helping. It was under served.&#34;\n  Fast forward to today and  Pyston is now in version 2.2, and has been open-sourced, with Modzelewski and fellow developer Marius Wachtler now leading the project as co-founders. The latest implementation promises a 30% performance improvement over Python 3.8.8, with a key benefit being that developers can simply drop their Python applications into Pyston and get going, without having to rewrite their code. It&#39;s also a &#34;completely separate thing&#34; to what Modzelewski and fellow developers built for Dropbox some seven years ago.\n &#34;We very much want you to be able to just drop in Pyston instead of the normal Python, and not have to do a single other thing,&#34; says Modzelewski.\n &#34;At the time we started, Dropbox&#39;s code base was millions of lines of code. And you can&#39;t really reasonably rewrite that into another language or annotate the whole thing.&#34;\n The goal for Pyston at the outset was to create a Python implementation that could push the programming language&#39;s performance to those comparable to traditional systems languages like    C++ .\n This would mean stripping out some of CPython&#39;s less-used features \u2013 such as debugging checks \u2013 and using just-in-time (JIT) techniques, such as those used in JavaScript, C# and Java, to edge up execution speeds.\n  Yet so many features had been added to Python over the years that it was hard to tell what was important and what could be ditched, says Modzelewski: &#34;I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about Python, and there were several features I didn&#39;t know about until actually having to implement them myself. I was like, &#39;I&#39;ve never heard about this, I&#39;ve never read about this, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone using it&#39;.&#34;\n The only way to figure out which features were useful to developers and which were not was to simply begin removing them and then wait for feedback. &#34;We wanted to start removing some of them so that we could start getting feedback from people saying, &#39;Hey, actually I use that feature and you removed it&#39;.&#34; Modzelewski says.\n This aggressive approach to optimization has allowed Pyston to gain significant performance improvements over CPython. While 30% is the figure officially touted, Modzelewski suggests that this is a conservative estimate, owing to the fact that Pyston uses more realistic performance benchmarks that better reflect how Pyston developers might actually experience it.\n &#34;We measure performance pretty differently than other projects do, so our 30% isn&#39;t directly comparable. If we were to measure performance the same way other people did our number would be higher,&#34; he says.\n &#34;Sometimes we think, should we do that? It sounds better to be &#39;more percent&#39; faster. But we try to measure performance similarly to how our users might actually experience it, and so that ends up giving us a lower number, and that&#39;s 30% for us.&#34;\n Python creator Guido van Rossum has himself called Python &#34;big and slow&#34;, which has  hindered its uptake in mobile app development and within web browsers. The language remains primarily aimed at data science and machine learning, as well as backend web services \u2013 though this is primarily dominated by JavaScript, and increasingly, Microsoft&#39;s TypeScript superset.\n  Pyston, meanwhile, is targeting web applications specifically. While there are a lot of tools for speeding up Python code \u2013 such as &#39;rival&#39; Pyton implementation PyPy \u2013 Modzelewski explains that these don&#39;t tend to work well for web applications, owing to the number of dependencies.\n It&#39;s this gap in the market that Pyston is targeting. &#34;We&#39;re looking to become the go-to way of speeding up Python web applications, by which I mean the components that run on a company&#39;s servers,&#34; he adds.\n  Guido van Rossum has pledged to address Python&#39;s performance issues in upcoming versions, boldly pledging to  double the language&#39;s speed in Python 3.11, one of three Python branches slated for a pre-alpha release in 2022.\n Modzelewski says there are similarities in what Python and Pyston are trying to achieve, but notes that any speed improvements in newer versions of Python won&#39;t translate over to Pyston; while the team has back-ported some of the newer Python code, it will continue to target version Python 3.8.\n Regardless, Modzelewski believes that Pyston can continue to be competitive. &#34;We&#39;ve been a lot more aggressive [than Python] with the types of things we&#39;ll do,&#34; he says, noting that Pyston&#39;s JIT compiler offers an edge in terms of the tools it has at its disposal.\n   There&#39;s currently no way of knowing for sure how many developers are using Pyston in the field. The project clearly has a following of enthusiastic and dedicated users, many of who will chime in to the Pyston Discord channel to report bugs or just let them know how they&#39;re getting on with it.\n Modzelewski says the primary goal of the project is to build something that people will get value from. &#34;I think in this space it&#39;s really easy to build something incredibly technically interesting, something intellectually very interesting, but isn&#39;t a useful product to users...We&#39;re very much taking a product approach to this where we want to build useful, and I think we&#39;re doing that.&#34;\n Pyston is still very much in the growing phase.

Identified by  Light Reading, T-Mobile\u2019s existing  Test Drive program now works over eSIM with compatible iPhones. All you need to do is download an app, follow the instructions to start the trial with eSIM, and you\u2019re up and running \u2014 no billing information required. There\u2019s no change to your current carrier plan or phone number, but you\u2019ll be using T-Mobile data on your device.\n The Test Drive program  has been around in one form or another since 2014. With the most recent iteration \u2014 which is still available to those who can\u2019t use the eSIM feature \u2014 T-Mobile will send you a free Wi-Fi hotspot you can connect to with your current phone to try out the network. This new eSIM version offers the same kind of trial (30 days or 30GB, whichever you reach first) with less hassle.\n   T-Mobile says the eSIM option is a pilot program that it introduced last week. Currently, it only works with unlocked iPhones starting with XS and newer devices that are running iOS 14.5 or higher. If you have an iPhone 12-gen device, you\u2019ll also have access to T-Mobile\u2019s 5G network during your trial.\n We gave it a shot and it actually is as easy as it looks \u2014 just follow the set-up prompts and you\u2019re good to go. It definitely beats visiting a store or carrying a Wi-Fi hotspot. It is, of course, particularly beneficial for T-Mobile, too; the carrier is  looking to flex its relatively strong 5G spectrum holdings before Verizon and AT&amp;T start catching up later this year with newly acquired C-band frequencies.

The enclosure, LCD, keypad, backlighting and speaker have been re-used however the motherboard was re-designed from the ground up with low power components, a modern STM32 H7 microcontroller, an ISM LoRA radio and expanded flash memory.\n    Sports enthusiasts - people who participate in remote area sporting activities, out of mobile service\n Why was this device created? It was developed as a science project to learn/teach everything about the STM32 ecosystem of products, hardware engineering, embedded systems engineering, and encrypted communications.\n This is considered an &#39;advanced&#39; project so if you&#39;re just starting out with embedded systems or have only ever used the arduino platform then the concepts shown here could be challenging. You should be familiar with C/C++, SWD debugging, ARM core knowledge along with bare metal device driver development.\n   User iterfaced developed with the amazing TouchGFX GUI builder created by ST. The e63 doesn&#39;t support touch and TouchGFX doesn&#39;t work with keypads or buttons so interfacing the keypad to the GUI engine was not a trivial exercise.\n    Touch GFX- the incredible ST GUI technology has been adapted to function with a Nokia e63 keypad\n    Self healing mesh networking - enables group communication over vast distances. Devices (nodes) act as relay stations.\n       Board Schematics and DesignI&#39;ll publish the motherboard if I get some positive interest in this project from the community.Contact me here:

significantly worse\u2019 in recent years.\n Less than three months before the collapse of the Champlain Towers South condo in Surfside, Fla., the president of the condominium association warned in a letter that the damage in the building had \u201cgotten significantly worse\u201d since it was  highlighted in a 2018 inspection.\n The letter was written to residents by Jean Wodnicki, president of the association\u2019s board of directors, explaining why a list of extensive construction projects were worth a $15 million special assessment that residents were being asked to pay.  Along with the 2018 inspection, which warned of \u201cmajor structural damage,\u201d the letter, a copy of which The New York Times obtained, adds to a growing body of evidence that engineers had raised alarms about serious flaws in the building months and even years before the catastrophic building failure, which killed 11 people and left 150 unaccounted for.\n  That 2018 inspection warned that concrete damage would \u201cmultiply exponentially\u201d in the coming years, Ms. Wodnicki wrote in the letter, which was first reported by  USA Today and  The Wall Street Journal. The engineer who prepared that initial report, Frank Morabito, carried out \u201ca much more detailed survey of the property\u201d and found signs that this acceleration was indeed already happening. \u201cWhen you can visually see the concrete spalling (cracking), that means that the rebar holding it together is rusting and deteriorating beneath the surface,\u201d Ms. Wodnicki wrote.\n Less than three months before the collapse of the Champlain Towers South condo complex, the president of the condominium association warned in a letter that the damage in the building had \u201cgotten significantly worse\u201d since it was highlighted in a 2018 inspection.\n  Read Document\n She explained that these signs of growing damage were why the estimated costs of repair had jumped by some 60 percent since that 2018 inspection. \u201cThe concrete deterioration is accelerating. The roof situation got much worse,\u201d she wrote adding: \u201cNew problems have been identified.\u201d\n \u201cA lot of this work could have been done or planned for in years gone by,\u201d she wrote in the letter. \u201cBut this is where we are now.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-30 04:17:27", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u516c\u5bd3,official,\u635f\u5bb3", "title": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u516c\u5bd3\u5b98\u65b9\u8b66\u544a\u4f24\u5bb3\u201c\u5f97\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u201d ", "title_en": "Condo official warned damage had \u2018gotten significantly worse\u2019 in recent years", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/us/surfside-building-collapse-warning-letter.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u516c\u5bd3", "official", "\u635f\u5bb3"]}]
