One common adaptation is the ability to make antifreezing proteins (AFPs) that prevent ice crystals from growing in blood, tissues, and cells. It’s a solution that has evolved repeatedly and independently, not just in fish but in plants, fungi, and bacteria.</p><p>为了在北极和南极洲周围的寒冷海洋水域生存，海洋生物进化了许多对致命感冒的防御。一种常见的适应是能够制造防止冰晶在血液，组织和细胞中生长冰晶的抗冻蛋白（AFP）。它是一种解决方案，它反复和独立地发展，而不仅仅是在鱼类中，而是在植物，真菌和细菌中。</p><p> It isn’t surprising, then, that herrings and smelts, two groups of fish that commonly roam the northernmost reaches of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, both make AFPs. But it is very surprising, even weird, that both fish do so with the same AFP gene—particularly because their ancestors diverged more than 250 million years ago and the gene is absent from all the other fish species related to them.</p><p> 这并不令人惊讶的是，鲱鱼和冶炼，两组鱼通常漫游大西洋和太平洋的最北端，都制作了一步。但是，这是非常令人惊讶的，甚至很奇怪，这两条鱼都是用同样的AFP基因这样做 - 特别是因为他们的祖先在超过2.5亿年前发散而且基因没有与他们相关的所有其他鱼类。</p><p> A March 2021 paper in   Trends in Genetics holds the unorthodox explanation: The gene became part of the smelt genome through a direct horizontal transfer from a herring. It wasn’t through hybridization, because herring and smelt can’t crossbreed, as many failed attempts have shown. The herring gene made its way into the smelt genome outside the normal sexual channels.</p><p> 2021年3月涉及遗传趋势的论文持有非正统的解释：基因通过鲱鱼的直接水平转移成为浓型基因组的一部分。由于鲱鱼和闻到，因此，由于许多失败的尝试表明，它并非杂交。鲱鱼基因在正常的性途径外进入熔炼基因组。</p><p> Laurie Graham, a molecular biologist at Queen’s University, in Ontario, and the lead author on the paper, knows she’s making a bold claim in arguing for the direct transfer of a gene from one fish to another. That kind of horizontal DNA movement once wasn’t imagined to happen in any animals, let alone vertebrates. Still, the more she and her colleagues study the smelt, the clearer the evidence becomes.</p><p> 在安大略省的女王大学的分子生物学家劳蒂格雷厄姆和本文的牵头作者，知道她在争论将基因直接转移到另一个鱼的直接转移方面进行了大胆的索赔。这种水平DNA运动曾经没有想到任何动物，更不用说脊椎动物。尽管如此，她和她的同事越多研究了冶炼，就可以更清晰地证明了。</p><p>  Nor are the smelt unique. Recent studies of a range of animals—other fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals—point to a similar conclusion: The lateral inheritance of DNA, once thought to be exclusive to microbes, occurs on branches throughout the tree of life.</p><p>  冶炼也是独一无二的。最近的一系列动物 - 其他鱼类，爬行动物，鸟类和哺乳动物 - 点到类似的结论：DNA的外侧遗传，一旦被认为是单微生物，就会发生在整个生命之树的树枝上。</p><p> Sarah Schaack, an evolutionary genomicist at Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, believes these cases of horizontal transfer still have “a pretty big wow factor” even among scientists, “because the conventional wisdom for so long was that it was less likely or impossible in eukaryotes.” But the smelt discovery and other recent examples all point to horizontal transfers playing an influential role in evolution.</p><p> 俄勒冈州波特兰的芦苇学院的进化基因组家莎拉·桑帕克认为，即使在科学家们，仍然有“一个非常大的哇因子”，“因为这么长时间的传统智慧就是不太可能或不可能的在真核生物中。“但冶炼发现和其他最近的例子都指向水平转移在演化中发挥着影响力的作用。</p><p>  Back in the early 2000s, Graham was studying AFPs under the direction of her lab leader, Peter Davies, when she was struck by the uncanny resemblance of the smelt protein’s gene to one of the antifreeze genes produced by herring. The genes’ introns—stretches of noncoding DNA, which generally mutate faster than coding regions—are more than 95 percent identical. “The only conclusion we could come up with was that the gene was transferred horizontally,” she says.</p><p>  回到2000年代初，格雷厄姆在彼得戴维斯的实验室领导者的方向下研究了法官，当时她被浓蛋白基因对鲱鱼产生的一种防冻基因的不可思议的相似之处。非致DNA的基因内含物延伸，其通常比编码区更快 - 超过95％。 “我们唯一可以提出的结论是基因被水平转移，”她说。 </p><p> But when the team tried to publish its findings, the researchers faced significant pushback. “We sent it to journal after journal, and we really had to fight to get it in,” Graham says. Their timing was perhaps unfortunate. In 2001, one of the major papers describing the newly sequenced human genome made extraordinary claims of horizontal gene  transfers from bacteria based on comparisons with some animal genomes. These claims were quickly refuted by work showing that the lineages of species between bacteria and humans had once had the genes but  lost them.</p><p>但是当团队试图发布其调查结果时，研究人员面临着显着的推动力。 “我们在日记期间发送了杂志，我们真的不得不打它，”格雷厄姆说。他们的时间可能是不幸的。 2001年，描述了新测序的人类基因组的主要论文之一是根据与一些动物基因组的比较，从细菌中转移水平基因的非凡索赔。这些权利要求通过工作迅速驳斥，表明细菌和人类之间的物种谱系曾经有过这种基因但失去了它们。</p><p> “Then we came along and tried to publish this, and it was in a climate where people were saying, ‘These claims are bunk,’” Graham says. Even after the paper was eventually published in 2008 by   Plos One, the conclusions were doubted. “Probably about half the people in our field said, ‘Oh! This is really cool!’ and the other half said, ‘No. We don’t believe you,’” she says.</p><p> “然后我们来了，试图发表这个，它是一个人们所说的气候，”这些索赔是铺位的，“格雷厄姆说。即使纸张最终在2008年由PLOS举行，结论是怀疑的。 “大概有一个关于我们领域的一半人说，'哦！这真的很酷！“另一半说，'不。我们不相信你，“”她说。</p><p> The disbelief in the team’s findings was understandable because the barriers to horizontal transfer in eukaryotes looked insurmountable. Horizontal transfers are common and easy in bacteria, whose DNA is just within their cytoplasm. If a DNA fragment can make its way through a bacterium’s cell wall and membrane, there’s not much to bar its integration into the genome. But eukaryotes keep their genome cloistered inside a second barrier, the nucleus, and most of the time, their DNA is tightly condensed into chromosomes that limit the opportunities for splicing into the genome. Moreover, for a horizontal transfer to establish itself in a eukaryotic species, it can’t integrate into just any cell’s DNA; it needs to end up in a germ cell, be passed on to offspring, and persist in the general population. That chain of events seemed wildly unlikely to many scientists.</p><p> 团队调查结果的难以理解是可以理解的，因为真核生物中水平转移的障碍看起来不可逾越。水平转移在细菌中是常见的且易于细菌的，其DNA在其细胞质内。如果DNA片段可以通过细菌的细胞壁和膜来使其粘附到基因组中的含量并不多。但真核生物将它们的基因组在第二个屏障内，细胞核和大部分时间内，它们的DNA紧密凝结成染色体，限制剪接到基因组中的机会。此外，对于水平转移以在真核物种中建立自己，它不能融入任何细胞的DNA;它需要最终在生殖器中，被转移到后代，并持续在一般人群中。这一事件链似乎很不可能对许多科学家来说都不敏感。</p><p> Not to be deterred, Graham and her colleagues probed deeper. By cloning large chunks of the smelt genome in bacteria, they determined that smelt have only one AFP gene. When they looked at the corresponding genomic regions of other fish with published genome sequences, they found  no traces of an AFP gene, not even a defunct one, although the array of genes that flanked the smelt’s AFP gene was there. “That suggested that this was something that came in; it was a new arrival in the smelt,” Graham explains. “And yet, we still had people who said, ‘No, we don’t buy it.’”</p><p> 不要被吓倒，格雷厄姆和她的同事探讨了更深。通过在细菌中克隆大块浓斑的基因组，他们确定冶炼只有一个AFP基因。当他们用公开的基因组序列看着其他鱼的相应基因组区域时，他们发现没有AFP基因的痕迹，甚至没有缺陷的痕迹，尽管在那里侧翼的基因阵列。 “这表明这是一个进来的东西;这是冶炼的新抵达，“格雷厄姆解释道。 “然而，我们还有人说，”不，我们不买它“。</p><p>  Finally, in 2019, a full sequence for the herring genome was  published. It let the team better examine the sequences surrounding the AFP gene, some of which appeared to be “transposable elements” (TEs, or transposons), mobile chunks of DNA that can copy and paste themselves in a genome. The herring genome holds many copies of these TEs, but they are absent from other fish—with one telling exception. Three of them flank the rainbow smelt’s AFP gene, in the same order seen around the herring AFP gene.</p><p>  最后，在2019年，公布了鲱鱼基因组的全序列。它让团队更好地检查AFP基因周围的序列，其中一些似乎是“转换元素”（TES，或转座子），DNA的移动大块可以在基因组中复制和粘贴自己。鲱鱼基因组持有这些TES的许多副本，但它们缺席其他鱼 - 一个讲述异常。其中三个以鲱鱼AFP基因周围看到的相同顺序侧翼了彩虹闻到的AFP基因。</p><p> Graham thinks that these sequences are “definitive proof” that a small chunk of a herring chromosome made its way into a smelt’s. “If anybody wants to dispute this,” she says, “you know, I don’t see how they possibly could.”</p><p> 格雷厄姆认为这些序列是“明确的证明”，鲱鱼染色体的一小块成功地进入了冶炼。 “如果有人想要解决这个问题，”她说，“你知道，我看不到他们可能的可能性。”</p><p> Cédric Feschotte, a genome biologist at Cornell University who was not involved in the study, agrees. “It seems unmistakable when you look at the data,” he says. What really intrigues him, though, is how well this finding lines up with work that he and others are doing on TEs and the rise of new genes.</p><p> Corcell大学的基因组生物学家CédricFeschotte，他不参与研究，同意。 “当你看待数据时，看起来难以理解，”他说。然而，真正有趣的是他的兴趣与他和其他人在特色和新基因的崛起的崛起中的作品有多好。 </p><p> For instance, in  a 2008 study published in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he and his colleagues identified a new kind of TE found in a disparate group of vertebrates, including a few species of mammals, a reptile, and an amphibian. These TEs were more than 96 percent identical in these species but were strangely absent from other examined genomes. Because the elements seemed to have appeared suddenly, Feschotte and his colleagues dubbed them “Space Invader elements” (“SPIN elements” for short) and concluded that they must have recently moved horizontally between the sundry lineages. These TEs weren’t merely genetic noise in their new hosts, either: Mice, for example, had obtained a whole new functional gene by co-opting a SPIN-element enzyme.</p><p>例如，在2008年在国家科学院的诉讼程序中发表的一项研究中，他和他的同事确定了一种在一个不同的脊椎动物组中发现的新类型，包括少数哺乳动物，爬行动物和两栖动物。这些特性在这些物种中具有96％比96％相同，但奇怪的是来自其他研究的基因组。因为这些元素似乎突然出现，因此Feschotte和他的同事被称为“太空入侵元素”（“旋转元素”短）并且得出结论，它们必须最近在杂物谱系之间水平移动。这些TES并不仅仅是其新宿主中的遗传噪声，例如：例如，通过共同旋转旋转元素酶获得全新的功能基因。</p><p> Since the 2008 SPIN paper, thousands of other horizontal TE transfers between animals have been reported. While these putative horizontal transfers were initially met with surprise, much as Graham’s AFP gene was, the evidence is now undeniable.</p><p> 自2008年旋转纸以来，报告了动物之间的数千种其他水平TE转移。虽然这些推定的水平转移最初令人惊讶地遇到，但随着Graham的AFP基因是，证据现在不可否认。</p><p> For context, it’s worth noting that horizontal transfers can be hard to detect: Over time, ever more mutations accumulate in both the original and the recipient lineages, obscuring similarities in a shared gene. Proving that a gene has been horizontally transferred also depends on demonstrating that it wasn’t once present in other related species and then lost through evolution, which can be difficult when some of those species are extinct.</p><p> 对于上下文，值得注意的是，水平转移可能很难检测到：随着时间的推移，在原始和接收者谱系中累积的更多突变，掩盖了共享基因中的相似性。证明基因已经水平转移也取决于证明它不曾出现在其他相关物种中，然后通过演变丢失，当其中一些物种灭绝时，这可能是困难的。</p><p> “The rate of actual horizontal transfer is probably much, much higher than we realize,” Schaack says.</p><p> “实际水平转移的速度可能很多，比我们意识到要高得多，”Schaack说。</p><p>  Although no one knows how often DNA jumps between vertebrate cells,  Clément Gilbert, an evolutionary biologist at Paris-Saclay University, in France, and his colleagues found at least  975 transfers when they screened the 307 vertebrate genomes that were publicly available on GenBank at the end of 2017. What stands out in that data is that these transfers occur overwhelmingly between fishes. Almost 94 percent of the transfers involved ray-finned fishes; less than 3 percent involved birds or mammals.</p><p>  虽然没有人知道在法国巴黎 - 萨莱大学的进化生物学家脊椎动物细胞之间的DNA吉尔伯特（ClémentGilbert）的频率如何发现，他的同事发现了至少975次转移，当他们筛选了在Genbank上公开使用的307个脊椎动物基因组2017年底。在那种数据中，有什么突出的是，这些转移在鱼类之间发生了压倒性。近94％的转移涉及射线炸鱼;少于3％的鸟类或哺乳动物。</p><p> “I’m still very much puzzled about how this is possible,” Gilbert says.</p><p> “我仍然非常困惑，吉尔伯特说。</p><p> One explanation could hinge on herring’s famously exuberant spawning efforts. “If you were flying in a plane, and you look down at the coastline where they’re spawning, the water is milky-white in color because there’s so much sperm being released during the mating process,” Graham says. The vast majority of those sperm fail to find eggs, degrade, and release their DNA.</p><p> 一个解释可以遵守鲱鱼的着名旺盛的产卵努力。 “如果你在飞机上飞行，你瞧不起他们产卵的海岸线，水是乳白色的，因为在交配过程中有很多精子，”格雷厄姆说。绝大多数精子未发现鸡蛋，降解，并释放他们的DNA。 </p><p> She thinks the DNA could stick to the gametes from other species spawning in the same area, and then get dragged into an egg cell during fertilization. For decades, genetic engineers have used a similar technique called  sperm-mediated gene transfer to make transgenic organisms. There’s no guarantee that this will result in a successful DNA insertion, but sometimes it does—“and then all of a sudden,  bam! There you go. You’ve got a transgenic organism,” Graham says. This could be how the herring AFP gene got into the smelt, and how many of the other horizontal gene transfers that Gilbert saw in fish occurred too.</p><p>她认为DNA可以粘在同一个区域中产卵的其他物种中的配子上，然后在受精期间被拖入卵细胞中。几十年来，遗传工程师使用类似的技术称为精子介导的基因转移以使转基因生物体。没有保证这将导致成功的DNA插入，​​但有时它会突然间，BAM！你去了。 “你有一个转基因生物，”格雷厄姆说。这可能是鲱鱼AFP基因如何融入冶炼，以及吉尔伯特在鱼中锯的其他水平基因转移有多少。</p><p> But it can’t be the only explanation: Horizontal genetic transfers also turn up in animals whose gametes don’t have the same opportunity to pick up errant DNA.</p><p> 但它不能是唯一的解释：水平遗传转移还会在动物的动物中出现，其配子没有相同的机会拿起错误的DNA。</p><p>  One day,  David Adelson, who studies genome evolution at the University of Adelaide, in Australia, was approached for help by his graduate student James Galbraith, who was assisting a colleague in annotating the genome of the olive sea snake ( Aipysurus laevis). Galbraith was finding that some of the sequences did not relate to anything else found in reptiles. So Adelson and Galbraith dug deeper.</p><p>  有一天，在阿德莱德大学研究阿德莱德大学的大卫阿德利森在澳大利亚接近他的研究生詹姆斯加里布里斯的帮助，他正在协助同事注释橄榄海蛇（Aipyyurus Laevis）的基因组。 Galbraith发现一些序列与爬行动物中发现的任何其他序列都没有涉及。所以亚德尔顿和加利器挖得深。</p><p> In the end, they discovered evidence of seven horizontal transfers of TEs into the sea-snake genome. It was hard to say exactly what species the donors had been, but Adelson said the best matches were found in fish and, in one case, corals.</p><p> 最后，他们发现了七种水平转移到海蛇基因组的证据。很难说捐助者已究竟是什么物种，但阿尔斯顿表示，在鱼类中发现了最佳比赛，在一个案例中发现了珊瑚。</p><p> Graham’s external-fertilization hypothesis doesn’t fit for these snakes, which fertilize internally and bear live young. Adelson is betting instead on the involvement of parasites. “Parasites go from species to species, they have interesting life cycles, and they can be internal,” he explains. Studies of horizontal transfers in terrestrial species have implicated parasites too.</p><p> 格雷厄姆的外部施肥假设不适合这些蛇，在内部施肥和熊生存的蛇。阿尔斯顿正在投注寄生虫的参与。 “寄生虫从物种到物种，他们有有趣的生命周期，他们可以内在，”他解释道。陆地物种水平转移的研究也意味着寄生虫。</p><p> While  Atma Ivancevic, now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder, was a doctoral student of Adelson’s, she traced the evolutionary history of TEs across vertebrates and other species. Of particular interest to her were the TEs called BovBs—small sequences of roughly 3,000 base pairs with a patchy distribution among animals. They are in cows and some marsupials, but in few mammals in between, and they also show up in snakes and other reptiles. Ivancevic searched for evidence of the loss of these transposons in the intermediate lineages, but found none.</p><p> 虽然Atma Ivancevic，现在是Colorado大学的博尔德大学的博士后研究员是Adelson的博士生，她追溯了脊椎动物和其他物种的进化史。对她特别感兴趣的是叫做大约3,000个碱基对的Bovbs小序列，在动物之间具有斑驳的分布。他们在奶牛和一些泥浆中，但在几乎没有哺乳动物，他们也出现在蛇和其他爬行动物中。伊凡芯在中间谱系中寻找丢失这些转座子的证据，但发现没有。</p><p>  Then the team found something even more intriguing: BovBs very similar to the ones in cows and snakes were also in ticks and bedbugs. Studies have shown that these biting parasites can pass viruses into their hosts through secreted vesicles called  exosomes. If TEs can also end up in exosomes, then Ivancevic thinks that the biting parasites and their exosomes might jointly act as vectors for transferring TEs from one host to a second host.</p><p>  然后球队发现了更具兴趣的东西：BOVBS与牛和蛇中的BOVBS也在蜱和臭虫中。研究表明，这些尖刺寄生虫可以通过称为外泌体的分泌囊泡通过病毒进入其宿主。如果TES也可以在外来体中最终，那么IVENCEVIC认为尖刺寄生虫和它们的外来物可能共同充当用于将TES从一个宿主转移到第二个主体的载体。 </p><p> Differences in how often various species are parasitized might therefore contribute to the frequency with which they pick up horizontal transfers. The differences might also reflect something more basic to their physiology or biochemistry: Certain organisms may be less discriminating about preventing wandering chunks of DNA from settling into their genome. Perhaps the increased abundance of transfers in fish has more to do with the animals themselves, rather than their habitat.</p><p>因此，各种物种的差异可能导致它们拾取水平转移的频率。差异也可能反映他们的生理学或生物化学的基础：某些生物可能不那么辨别，导致防止DNA的徘徊在其基因组中。也许鱼类的数量增加与动物自己有关，而不是他们的栖息地。</p><p> In reality, “there’s not a single answer,” Feschotte says. “It’s a little bit of everything.” Still, testing these hypotheses would be helpful. Not only might the research reveal potential environmental factors involved; it could help elucidate exactly how these transfers happen.</p><p> 实际上，“没有一个答案，”Feschotte说。 “这是一切的一切。”仍然，测试这些假设会有所帮助。该研究不仅可以揭示所涉及的潜在环境因素;它可以帮助阐明这些转移如何发生。</p><p>  “How often am I actually taking up a piece of DNA from my environment and I don’t know it?” Schaack asks. “Maybe a lot; maybe more than I realize.” Such transfers could go unnoticed unless they happened in germ cells. The detected transfer events must therefore be only a tiny proportion of the full number of transfers that occur.</p><p>  “我经常乘坐来自环境的一块DNA，我不知道吗？” Schaack问道。 “可能很多;也许比我意识到更多。“除非它们发生在生殖细胞中，否则这种转移可能会被忽视。因此，检测到的传输事件必须只是发生的全部数量的微小比例。</p><p> The unsettling possibility is that horizontal DNA transfers could happen all the time. For instance, a 2020   Plos Genetics paper found that TEs not only jump into mosquito genomes but can be transmitted into other species through filarial worms (nematodes) that the mosquitoes carry. “How many times have we all been bitten by mosquitoes?” Adelson asks. “My view is this happens at an astounding rate … I bet we’re constantly being bombarded.”</p><p> 令人不安的可能性是水平DNA转移可能一直发生。例如，2020 PLOS遗传学纸张发现，TES不仅跳入蚊子基因组，而且可以通过蚊子携带的丝状蠕虫（线虫）传输到其他物种中。 “我们都被蚊子咬了多少次？”阿德尔森问道。 “我的观点是这种发生的令人惊讶的速度......我打赌我们经常被轰炸。”</p><p> Whatever the rate of horizontal transfers, their cumulative impact on evolutionary history is undeniable. Take the effect of the transferred AFP gene in smelt. “We think that as soon as the smelt got this gene, it had an immediate selective advantage,” Graham says. “That selective advantage is not freezing to death in icy waters.” It meant the smelt could spread northward and enjoy free rein in the Arctic, shifting the composition of that ecosystem.</p><p> 无论水平转移率如何，它们对进化史的累积影响是不可否认的。采取转移的AFP基因在冶炼中的作用。 “我们认为，一旦冶炼获得了这个基因，它就会立即有选择性的优势，”格雷厄姆说。 “这种选择性优势在冰冷的水域中没有冻死。”这意味着冶炼可以在北极地向北传播并享受自由缰绳，转移该生态系统的组成。</p><p> Even if transmissible elements are sometimes dismissed as “junk” DNA, they can have dramatic impacts. TEs are “the most exciting, dynamic, and potentially influential sector of the genome,” Schaack says, especially because they represent “an internal source of mutagenesis in every genome.” Not only do they alter DNA when they’re pasted in, but because they consist of repetitive sequences, their very presence increases the likelihood of genetic recombination.</p><p> 即使传染性元素有时被驳回为“垃圾”DNA，它们也可以产生戏剧性的影响。 TES是“基因组最令人兴奋，动态和潜在的影响力，”Schaack说，特别是因为它们代表了“每种基因组中的内部诱变来源”。当它们粘贴到粘贴时，它们不仅会改变DNA，而且因为它们由重复序列组成，它们的存在增加了遗传重组的可能性。</p><p> “Anything you want, I can give you an example of what a transposon can do and has done,” Feschotte says. “Bringing in new genes, new regulatory sequences, rearranging chromosomes—you name it.” He points out that the immune system’s ability to generate an astronomical diversity of antibodies seems to have come from a TE that suddenly entered the genome of the ancestor of all jawed vertebrates 400 million years ago.</p><p> “你想要的任何东西，我可以给你一个超凡乐能可以做到的例子，”feschotte说。 “带入新的基因，新的调节序列，重新排列染色体 - 你叫做它。”他指出，免疫系统产生天文多样性的抗体的能力似乎来自于突然进入400万年前所有下巴脊椎动物的祖先的基因组的TE。 </p><p> Gilbert agreed that TEs can be an immense source of genomic novelty. “The fact that these elements are transferred a lot between taxa through horizontal transfer, and not only through vertical evolution, means that horizontal transfer has an important impact,” he says.</p><p>Gilbert同意TES可以是基因组新奇的巨大来源。 “通过水平转移，这些元素在分类群之间转移了很多，而且不仅通过垂直演变，这些要素的事实意味着水平转移具有重要影响，”他说。</p><p> Even though transfers into somatic cells are evolutionary dead ends, they could affect the health and fitness of individuals, Adelson notes. Altering any cell’s genome could have physiological ramifications, such as triggering a cancerous growth. “We just don’t really have any idea of what the impact of these things might be,” he says.</p><p> 即使转移到体细胞是进化的死亡时期，它们也可能影响个人的健康和适应性，阿尔森票据。改变任何细胞的基因组可能具有生理后果，例如引发癌症生长。 “我们并不真正了解这些事情的影响可能是什么，”他说。</p><p> Future studies may quantify the rate of DNA transfer in our everyday lives. Recent advances in single-cell and long-read sequencing put the experiments needed to see transfers in real time within reach, Adelson says. “I think the first time someone reports that there’s a transfer of DNA from a mosquito bite to a human … that’ll get some attention,” he says.</p><p> 未来的研究可能会量化我们日常生活中的DNA转移率。阿德利森说，单细胞和长读测序的最新进展将在REACH中实时查看转移所需的实验。 “我第一次认为有人报告说，从蚊子叮咬将DNA转移到一个人......这将得到一些关注，”他说。</p><p> Developments in evolutionary modeling and genetics may also finally allow us to look for ancient gene transfers that were too hard to spot just a decade ago. Gilbert believes enough whole genomes have now been sequenced that he could scan the vertebrate tree for whole-gene transfers, much as he and his colleagues detected hundreds of TE transfers. “We’ve been thinking of doing it,” he says. “We just need to do it.”</p><p> 进化建模和遗传学的发展也可能最终允许我们寻找古老的基因转移，这是十年前的难以发现的。吉尔伯特认为，现在已经测量了足够的全基因，以便他可以扫描脊椎动物，以便全基因转移，就像他和他的同事检测到数百个转移一样。 “我们一直在想，”他说。 “我们只需要这样做。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/gene-jumped-fish/619183/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/gene-jumped-fish/619183/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/遗传学/">#遗传学</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/fish/">#fish</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/转移/">#转移</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
