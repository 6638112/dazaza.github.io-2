This has resulted in Ingham\u2019s shipping more whole chickens to supermarkets and other retailers.\n Consumers have reported empty shelves in the chicken sections of supermarkets as shoppers clear out available stock.\n  Ingham\u2019s said its main sites were open and \u201chave not experienced significant on-site transmission of Covid\u201d.\n \u201cHowever, they are experiencing significantly lower levels of staff availability which is impacting production volumes and operational efficiency,\u201d the company said.\n \u201cOperational changes are being made to volume and mix across Ingham\u2019s Australian business and it is not currently possible to predict how long this disruption will continue.\u201d\n A KFC spokesperson said the fast food chain was \u201ccurrently experiencing intermittent supply chain disruptions nationally due to Covid-19 related absenteeism at our chicken suppliers, meaning some of our restaurants are unable to offer our full menu which relies on fresh chicken\u201d.\n \u201cWe\u2019re working with our multiple suppliers to mitigate the impact and provide them with support, but we expect some disruptions to continue in the coming weeks.\u201d\n  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\n Ingham\u2019s said it was too early to tell what effect the shortages would have on profit.\n Its managing director, Andrew Reeves, said many employees were \u201cforced to isolate at home due to contracting Covid in the community or as a result of being close contacts\u201d.\n He said a decision by state and federal governments which removed a requirement for asymptomatic close contacts who work in the meat industry to isolate for seven days \u201cshould assist to alleviate some of the current staff shortages\u201d.\n \u201cAs operating conditions begin to stabilise, we expect our production capacity to recover relatively quickly to meet customer and consumer demand.\u201d\n The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said workers in meatworks were particularly vulnerable to catching Covid-19.\n \u201cThere\u2019s social distancing that\u2019s been put in place but that is not enough with Omicron and inevitably if one person on that line gets sick and is infectious there\u2019s a high chance, especially as we know because of that type of wet, cold environment, for it to spread as well,\u201d she said.\n Eggs, however, are not yet in short supply, with the industry confident that it can handle the disruptions.\n \u201cAny absence of eggs in stores is a result of disruptions to supermarket staffing and logistics, and not a reflection of continuity of supply,\u201d said Rowan McMonnies, managing director of Australian Eggs.\n \u201cAustralia\u2019s 21 million hens are still laying eggs, and farmers are working around the clock to get those eggs to their customers,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 18:41:11",

"note_en": "TechCrunch in October was the first to report that Brex was raising the capital and had achieved decacorn status. Greenoaks Capital and TCV co-led the financing, which brings the three-year-old San Francisco startup\u2019s total raised to $1.2 billion.\n Brex started its life focused on providing credit cards aimed mainly at startups and SMBs. It has gradually evolved its model with the aim of serving as a one-stop finance shop for these companies. Last April, Brex said it had combined  credit cards, business cash accounts and new spend management and bill pay software \u201ctogether in a single dashboard\u201d as part of   a service  called Brex Premium that cost $49 per month. Today, the company is focused on the corporate card product it\u2019s been building since its inception, banking products and expense management products. Or put more simply, it aims to serve as a \u201cfinancial operating system\u201d for its customers.\n  Its latest raise follows a year that saw a \u201cmore than doubling\u201d of revenue, according to co-CEO and co-founder Henrique  Dubugras , who declined to reveal hard figures. Existing investors made up about  95% of those participating in the Series D-2 round, he added.\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t open up to new ones because we had so many new investors with deep pockets who we\u2019d promised we\u2019d give more allocation to over the years,\u201d  Dubugras  told TechCrunch. \u201cThey were comfortable that we had hit the targets we said we were going to so that gave us some credibility to them.\u201d\n In conjunction with the funding announcement, Brex also announced that it has hired away an exec from Meta:   Karandeep Anand . Anand  has been named the company\u2019s chief product officer after having led  Meta\u2019s business products group, which served more than 200 million businesses globally. Prior to that, Anand spent 15 years at Microsoft, where he led the product management strategy for Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and developer platform efforts.  The exec will lead Brex\u2019s product portfolio expansion efforts, where a good portion of its new capital will be directed.\n \u201cKarandeep is an engineer by background so he is product and engineering-oriented but also business and customer-oriented,\u201d Dubugras told TechCrunch. \u201cHe\u2019s a unique hire in that sense, and that\u2019s particularly important for Brex. Our software and card touches most of the employees in a company even though it\u2019s the CFO that decides to buy it. Since we want to provide a consumer-like experience, he\u2019s going to help there.\u201d\n   \u201cThe opportunity to create economic opportunity for millions of people and businesses globally through innovation in financial products is incredibly exciting,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cThe opportunity ahead for Brex is expansive, and I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to create products that will help our customers grow their businesses.\u201d\n In terms of customers, Brex continues to serve startups or e-commerce companies that might be smaller businesses but with higher growth. As its earlier customers have grown and matured, Brex is now adapting to also serve mid-market to larger businesses which have different financial needs as they grow. This is where it appears Anand will be able to offer the greatest value.\n  The landscape for startups clamoring to meet companies\u2019 financial needs seems to increase by the day. One of Brex\u2019s most well-known competitors, Ramp, is also growing impressively and  last August, announced it had   raised $300 million  in a Series C round of funding that valued the company at $3.9 billion.  With its move to serve larger and more established companies, Brex seems to only be further encroaching into Ramp\u2019s territory.\n Nell Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, believes Brex has been able to build a card that meets the needs of \u201cmodern\u201d businesses and startups. And while that alone was compelling enough to attract his firm\u2019s attention, Greenoaks also saw the broader potential for a \u201ctruly extensible platform that could solve a universal set of problems,\u201d including providing better controls over employee spend, \u201cpainless\u201d expense reporting and rewards tailored to a company\u2019s specific needs.\n \u201cThe result is a differentiated experience that shows up in attractive customer loyalty, and some of the best growth metrics we\u2019d ever seen,\u201d he wrote via email. \u201cOn top of this, we\u2019ve been consistently impressed with Brex\u2019s team, who build excellent products fast, with a profound vision for the future of business banking.\u201d\n Mehta went on to say that Brex has become the \u201ccognitive referent\u201d for modern business banking.

Its data sets \u201clook just as real as a company\u2019s original customer data with just as many details, but without the original personal data points,\u201d the company says.\n Talking to TechCrunch, MOSTLY AI CEO  Tobias Hann said that the company plans to use the proceeds to push the boundaries of what its product can do, grow its team, and gain more customers both in Europe and in the U.S., where it already has offices in New York City.\n  MOSTLY AI was founded in Vienna in 2017, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was implemented across the EU one year later. This demand for privacy-preserving solutions and the concomitant rise of machine learning have created significant momentum for synthetic data.  Gartner predicts that by 2024, 60% of the data used for the de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment of AI and an\u00ada\u00adlyt\u00adics projects will be syn\u00adthet\u00adi\u00adcally gen\u00ader\u00adated.\n MOSTLY AI\u2019s typical clients are Fortune 100 banks and insurers, as well as telcos. These three highly regulated sectors drive most of the demand for synthetic tabular data, alongside healthcare.\n Unlike some of its competitors, MOSTLY AI hasn\u2019t put its focus on healthcare in the past, but it could change. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that we are watching closely and we are actually starting some pilot projects this year,\u201d the CEO said.\n The democratization of AI means that synthetic data will eventually be used well beyond Fortune 100 companies, Hann told TechCrunch. His company therefore plans to serve smaller organizations and a wider range of sectors in the future. But until now, it made sense for MOSTLY AI to focus on enterprise-level clients.\n  At the moment, enterprise companies are the ones that have the budgets, need and sophistication to work with synthetic data, Hann said. To match their expectations, MOSTLY AI obtained  ISO certifications.\n Talking to Hann, one thing becomes clear: While the startup has a solid technical footing, it is equally invested in the commercialization of its technology and in the business value it can add for its clients. \u201cMOSTLY AI is leading this emerging and rapidly-growing space in terms of both customer deployments and expertise,\u201d Molten Ventures\u2019 investment director Christoph Hornung said.\n The need to comply with privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA clearly drives demand for synthetic data, but it\u2019s not the only factor at play. For instance, demand in Europe is also driven by a wider cultural context; while in the U.S., it also results from a desire to innovate. For instance, use cases can include advanced analytics, predictive algorithms, fraud detection and pricing models \u2013 but without data that can be traced back to specific users.\n \u201cMany companies are proactively approaching the space because they understand that customers value privacy,\u201d Hann said. \u201cThese companies understand that they can also gain a competitive advantage when dealing and working with data in a privacy-preserving way.\u201d\n Seeing more U.S. companies wanting to adopt synthetic data in innovative ways is the key reason why MOSTLY AI wants to grow its team in the U.S. But it is also recruiting more generally, both in Vienna and remotely. Its plan is to increase its headcount from 35 to 65 people by the end of the year.\n Hann expects 2022 to be \u201cthe year where synthetic data will take off,\u201d and beyond this year, \u201ca really strong decade for synthetic data.\u201d This will be supported by growing demand for responsible AI, articulated around key concepts such as AI fairness and explainability. Synthetic data helps answer these challenges. \u201cIt enables enterprises to augment and de-bias their data sets,\u201d Hann said.\n Machine learning aside, MOSTLY AI sees lots of potential for synthetic data to be leveraged in software testing. Supporting these use cases requires making synthetic data accessible not only to data scientists, but also to software engineers and quality testers. It\u2019s with them in mind that MOSTLY AI came up a few months ago with version 2.0 of its platform. \u201cMOSTLY AI 2.0 can be implemented on premise or in a private cloud, and adapts to different data structures of the company using it,\u201d the company  wrote at the time.\n \u201cWe are clearly a B2B software infrastructure company,\u201d Hann said. Both in its Series A and B rounds, the company looked for investors who understood that approach.\n Molten Ventures being a  publicly listed VC and consequently not subject to typical funding cycles also carried some weight, Hann confirmed when I asked. \u201cHaving this long term commitment from a partner is something that was very appealing to us, because it\u2019s a little more flexible.\u201d\n It doesn\u2019t hurt either that Citi Ventures is the venture arm of Citigroup, and that it is headquartered in the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019re significantly increasing the team in the U.S., and it\u2019s always great to also have a U.S.-based investor that can help with network and relationships there,\u201d Hann said.\n With $25 million in new funding and an increased U.S. presence, MOSTLY AI will now have more resources to compete against other companies in its segment of the synthetic data space. These include  Tonic.ai, which raised a  $35 million Series B last September;  Gretel AI, which disclosed a  $50 million Series B round last October; and  seed-funded British startup Hazy, as well as players that focus on specific verticals.\n \u201cWe do see more and more players emerging in the space and in the market in general, so it certainly shows that there\u2019s a lot of interest there,\u201d Hann said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 17:54:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u5546\u4e1a,commercialize,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u827e\u90fd\u7b79\u96c6\u4e862500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMOSTLY AI raises $25 million to further commercialize synthetic data in Europe and the US\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/mostly-ai-raises-25-million-to-further-commercialize-synthetic-data-in-europe-and-the-u-s/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u5546\u4e1a", "\u6570\u636e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5ca79d6601c52352e2dbfc484139c659.jpg", "infoid": 1072741, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6765\u81eaMozilla\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7b2c\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u975e\u8425\u5229\u6027\u65b0\u95fb\u5ba4\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u6709\u5173Meta\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "note_en": "Rally, the privacy-first data-sharing platform from  Mozilla, will team up with nonprofit newsroom  The Markup on a research project to learn more about Meta\u2019s tracking infrastructure.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 17:27:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,meta,data,\u8ddf\u8e2a", "title": "Mozilla\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u9879\u76ee\u96c6\u4f1a\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u542f\u52a8Facebook Pixel Hunt\uff0c\u4e00\u9879\u8c03\u67e5Meta\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u7814\u7a76", "title_en": "Mozilla's data sharing project Rally and The Markup launch Facebook Pixel Hunt, a study to investigate Meta's data collection and tracking practices", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.adweek.com/media/mozilla-the-markup-team-up-on-a-deep-dive-into-metas-tracking-infrastructure/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "meta", "data", "\u8ddf\u8e2a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3335c0ebb15fbcbbecc8a6860254c7bb.jpg", "infoid": 1072740, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u5976\u916a\u5236\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u662f\u201cFankhauser\u7684\u5976\u916a\u9875\u201d\u3002\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u6b63\u5728\u8f6c\u6362 - \u6211\u5f88\u6b23\u8d4f\u4f60\u7684\u8010\u5fc3\u3002\n\u5f00\u59cb\u5976\u916a\u4f7f\u60a8\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e86\u89e3\u6210\u5206\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5976\u916a\u5236\u4f5c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002\n\u6211\u6545\u610f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f00\u53d1\u98df\u8c31\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98df\u8c31\u5728\u8d85\u5e02\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6210\u5206\u3002\u8981\u6c42\u7ecf\u7406\u83b7\u5f97\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8981\u4ece\u4e13\u4e1a\u6765\u6e90\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "Welcome to Cheese Making, formerly \u201cFankhauser\u2019s Cheese Page.\u201d Yes, my site is transitioning\u2013I appreciate your patience.\n Please let me know if you have any difficulty finding something\u2013especially if it is something you have found here before.\u00a0~David Fankhauser\n Beginning Cheese Making\u00a0 takes you to further information on ingredients and equipment along with a link to a syllabus for a beginning cheese making course.\n Here is a pamphlet I put together to accompany my Cheese Making courses:  Make Your Own Cheese, A Workshop on Cheese Making..\n                                   I have purposely tried to develop recipes which use ingredients easily found locally in supermarkets.

Although the parliament has avoided a financial penalty this time.\n The European Data Protection Supervisor\u2019s (EDPS) intervention relates to a COVID-19 test booking website which the European Parliament launched in September 2020 \u2014 using a third party provider, called Ecolog.\n  The website attracted a number of  complaints, filed by six MEPs, last year \u2014 with the support of the European privacy campaign group  noyb \u2014 over the presence of third party trackers and confusing cookie consent banners, among a raft of other compliance problems which also included transparency and data access issues.\n Following an investigation, the EDPS  found the parliament was at fault in several respects and it has issued a reprimand \u2014 ordering rectification of any outstanding issues within one month.\n The test booking website was found to be dropping cookies associated with Google Analytics and Stripe \u2014 but the parliament failed to demonstrate it had applied any special measures to ensure that any associated personal data transfers to the US would be adequately protected in light of the landmark Schrems II decision by the EU\u2019s top court.\n In July 2020, the CJEU struck down the bloc\u2019s flagship data transfer agreement with the US (aka, the EU-US Privacy Shield) and issued further guidance that transfers of EU people\u2019s personal data to all third countries must be risk assessed on a case by case basis.\n  The ruling also made it clear that EU regulators must step in and suspend data flows if they believe people\u2019s information is at risk. So in order for some transfers to be legal (such as EU-US data flows) additional measures may be needed to raise the level of protection to the required standard of essential equivalence with EU law \u2014 something the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has  since issued  detailed guidance on.\n  However \u2014 in the case of the parliament\u2019s COVID-19 test booking site \u2014 the EDPS found no evidence that it or its provider had applied any such extra measures to safeguard EU-US transfers resulting from the inclusion of Google Analytics and Stripe cookies.\n Turns out the provider had copypasted code from another website it had built, for a test centre in the Brussels International Airport \u2014 hence the presence of cookies for payment company Stripe on the parliament site (despite no payments actually being required for testing booked via the website).\n Google Analytics cookies, meanwhile, had apparently been included by the provider to \u201cminimise the risk of spoofing and for website optimisation purposes\u201d, according to the EDPS\u2019 findings.\n Post- Schrems II, the presence of cookies designed to send data to US-based providers for processing creates immediate legal risk for EU-based websites \u2014 and/or their clients (in this case the parliament was found by the EDPS to be the sole data controller, while Ecolog was the data processor). So incorporating Google Analytics may do the opposite of \u2018optimizing\u2019 your site\u2019s compliance with EU data protection law.\n That said, enforcement of this particular compliance issue has been a slow burn, even since the 2020 CJEU ruling \u2014 with only a smattering of regulator-led investigations, and the  clearest leadership coming from the EDPS itself.\n A (very) long running complaint against Facebook\u2019s EU-US data transfers, meanwhile, brought by noyb founder Max Schrems in the wake of the 2013 Snowden disclosures about NSA mass surveillance of social network and Internet data, still hasn\u2019t resulted in a final decision by its lead data protection supervisor, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) \u2014 despite the latter agreeing   a full year ago that it would \u201cswiftly\u201d finalize the complaint.\n Again, though, that makes the EDPS\u2019 intervention on the parliament complaint all the more significant. tl;dr: EU banhammers are, gradually, falling.\n  In another finding against the parliament, the EDPS took issue with confusing cookie consent notices shown to visitors to the test booking website \u2014 which it found provided inaccurate information; did not always offer clear choices to reject third party tracking; and included deceptive design which could manipulate consent.\n By contrast, EU law on consent as a legal basis to process people\u2019s data requires is clear that choice must be informed, specific (i.e. purpose limited, rather than bundled) and freely given.\n The parliament was also found to have failed to respond adequately to complainants requests for information \u2014 breaching additional legal requirements law which provide Europeans with a suite of access rights related to their personal data.\n While the parliament has landed in the embarrassing situation of being reprimanded by the EDPS, it has avoided a fine \u2014 as the regulator only has narrow powers to issue financial penalties which it said these infringements did not trigger.\n But the findings of fault by the bloc\u2019s chief data protection supervisor draw fresh red lines around routine regional use of US-based tools like Google Analytics (or, indeed,  Facebook Pages) in the wake of the  Schrems II decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n Copypasting code with standard analytics calls might seem like a quick win to a website builder \u2014 but not if the entity responsible for safeguarding visitors\u2019 information fails to properly assess EU-based legal risk.\n The EDPS\u2019 reprimand for the parliament thus has wider significant as it looks likely to prefigure a wave of aligned decisions by EU regulators, given the  scores of similar complaints filed by noyb in August 2020 targeting websites across the bloc.\n \u201cWe expect more rulings on this matter in the next month,\u201d noyb\u2019s honorary chairman, Max Schrems, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe fact that the EDPS has taken a clear position is a good sign for other DPAs.\u201d\n The EDPS\u2019 sanction of the parliament over confusing cookie banners also sends a strong signal over what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not when it comes to obtaining users\u2019 consent to tracking \u2014 despite confusing dark patterns still being shamefully widespread in the EU.\n (For a particularly ironic example of that, see this  blog post by analyst Forrester \u2014 which warns that regulators are coming for \u201cdark patterns\u201d, even as the analyst\u2019s own webpage serves what very much looks like a non-compliant cookie notice given the only obvious button reads \u201cAccept cookies\u201d and it takes multiple clicks through sub-menus to find an option to reject tracking cookies, so er\u2026 )\n noyb also kicked off  a major effort targeting this type of cookie non-compliance last year \u2014 which it suggested could lead to it filing up to 10,000 complaints about dubious cookie banners with EU regulators.\n Regional regulators are clearly going to have their work cut out to clean up so much infringement \u2014 which in turn may encourage DPAs to coordinate on standardizing enforcements to drive the necessary scale of change.\n The EDPS decision adds high level accelerant by sending a clear signal that confusing cookie banners are the same as non-compliant cookie banners from the body responsible for providing EU lawmakers with expert guidance on how to interpret and apply data protection law.\n Here\u2019s an illustrative snippet from its decision \u2014 which describes a portion of the confusion that hit visitors to the parliament website as they tried to parse the cookie notices at the time of the complaints (tracking cookies have since been removed from the site):\n \u201cThe English version only referred to essential cookies and prompted the user to either click on the \u2018accept all\u2019 or the \u2018save\u2019 button. The difference between the two buttons was unclear. The French version of the second layer of cookie banner referred both to essential cookies and \u2018external media\u2019. These external media cookies included cookies from Facebook, Google Maps, Instagram, OpenStreetMap, Twitter, Vimeo and Youtube. The visitor could also choose between \u2018accept all\u2019 or \u2018save\u2019. The German version of the second layer of the cookie banner referred to only one \u2018external media\u2019 cookie \u2014 Google Maps \u2014 in addition to the essential cookie.\u201d\n The EDPS\u2019 conclusion was that the cookie banners in all three languages failed to meet the EU standard for consent.\n In another sign of the cookie (non)compliance reckoning that\u2019s now unfolding in the region, some EU regulators have been taking actual action \u2014 such as France\u2019s CNIL which issued a  major slap-down to Google and Facebook last week, announcing fines of $170M and $68M respectively for choosing dark pattern design over clear choices in their cookie consent flows.\n The EDPB, which supports DPAs\u2019 enforcement of pan-EU rules like the General Data Protection Regulation, established a task force on the cookie issue  last fall \u2014 saying it would \u201ccoordinate the response to complaints concerning cookie banners\u201d noyb had filed with a number of regional agencies.\n Schrems describes that step as a \u201cgood\u201d development \u2014 but said it is also slowing things down.\n Although he suggested the direction of travel is toward a standard that will require a simple yes/no for tracking.

For example, developers, who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play\u2019s billing system, would pay 11% through Google\u2019s alternative billing system.\n  Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s top executive in South Korea, Brandon Yoon, who was in charge of the app store system, abruptly left the iPhone maker in early November. According to media reports, Yoon\u2019s leave is not related to the alternative app payment system.\n  In late August 2021, the South Korean parliament  has passed the world\u2019s first bill to prevent the global tech giants from forcing developers to use their in-app billing systems.\n \u201cWe look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users,\u201d a spokesperson at Apple said.\n Apple said in its statement that the number of app developers operating in South Korea has increased to approximately 580,000, with more than 1.4 million apps available on the Korean App Store since 2008. Through its App Store, Apple has helped Korean developers access markets and customers in nearly 200 countries around the world, the company said.\n \u201cApple has a great deal of respect for Korea\u2019s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country\u2019s talented app developers.

dating to the last years of King Khufu\u2019s reign (c.2500 BC) at the oldest harbour in Egypt, a site on the Red Sea coast called Wadi al-Jarf.\n Excavations, led by Pierre Tallet and Gregory Marouard, began in 2011. Work had been ongoing along the coast for some years with the goal of learning more about ancient Egyptian trade with the mysterious land of Punt and of expeditions to Sinai for copper and turquoise extraction. The team excavated drystone buildings, a worker\u2019s camp, kilns and 30 storage galleries cut up to 30m into the hillside. These galleries held lengths of rope, wooden boat parts and ceramic storage jars. Each was used by a single boat, allowing it to be dismantled and stored safely, sealed at the entrance by a large stone block. A long, L-shaped stone jetty, still visible at low tide, stretches out into the sea, creating a sheltered dock where more than 21 stone anchors were found  in situ. Some of these are inscribed with short hieroglyphic texts that may be the names of boats.\n While clearing spaces in front of the galleries the team found over 400 papyrus fragments, from which seven documents have so far been reconstructed. Some are dated at the top of the page to \u2018The year after the 13th cattle count\u2019 of King Khufu, meaning around year 26 or 27 of his reign. This makes them the oldest papyrus documents yet found.\n Two types of document can be identified at Wadi al-Jarf: accounts and logbooks. The accounts detail the movement of the bread, beer, cereals and meat to feed the workers. This was their payment, as coinage was not used in Egypt until c.360 BC. The documents are laid out like a modern spreadsheet, showing what was needed, what had been delivered and what was still owed. Feeding the estimated 20,000-strong workforce spread across the pyramid site, quarries and transport teams would have been an immense commitment; the papyri reflect this, as different areas of Egypt take turns to deliver foodstuffs.\n To date, two of the logbooks have been published: one written by an inspector called Merer and one by a scribe named Dedi. Both men worked as part of a team, or\u00a0 aper, of around 1,000 workers called \u2018The Followers of \u201cThe Uraeus of Khufu is its Prow\u201d\u2019, whose name is well-attested on storage jars at Wadi al-Jarf. This team was divided into smaller crews of around 40 workers known as a  saa or  phyle, which were named \u2018The Big\u2019, \u2018The Small\u2019, \u2018The Asian\u2019 and \u2018The Prosperous\u2019. Merer led \u2018The Big\u2019 crew, while Dedi oversaw the work of all four crews centrally. Other inspectors are also named in the documents, although their names are sometimes incomplete: Mesou, Sekher[\u2026] and possibly [Ny]kaounesut lead the other crews. Together with the account books we can trace almost a year\u2019s activity, from June to May. From his writing, which is heavy with ink at the start of each column, we can tell that Merer wrote his journal daily, detailing the work of his team in bureaucratic detail. Their main work was transporting limestone blocks from the quarries of \u2018 Ro-Au\u2019 (Tura) to the site at Giza about 15-20km away. These bright white blocks were the casing of \u2018 Akhet Khufu\u2019 (\u2018Horizon of Khufu\u2019), as the pyramid was named, which provided an awe-inspiring finish to the structure that has since been removed, reused or lost (the internal blocks that are visible today were quarried close to Giza). Merer records what his team did each day and night, with occasional notes for the morning and noon activity.\n \u2018The Big\u2019 crew are described hauling stones at Tura, before loading cargo boats (usually a single boat, but sometimes up to five vessels at one time) and travelling two days down the Nile to Giza \u2018loaded with stones\u2019. The unladen return took only one day. The crew completed a round-trip between Giza and the quarries at Tura two or three times in each ten-day Egyptian week. This could only have taken place around the time of the yearly flood, when the high waters of the Nile made it more navigable for heavily laden vessels. It has been calculated that the boats could have carried a load of 70-80 tons, about 30 of the 2.5 ton blocks used to clad the pyramid of Khufu. This would mean that \u2018The Big\u2019 crew could have moved around 200 blocks a month; 1,000 in the period when the river and canals were navigable. Merer notes the presence of \u2018the nobleman Ankhhaf\u2019 serving as the Director of \u2018the entrance to the Pool of Khufu\u2019, probably an artificial lake, used as a staging post on the northbound journey from Tura to the Giza Plateau. Ankhhaf was Khufu\u2019s half-brother, Vizier (prime minister), Director of Royal Works and ostensibly the pyramid\u2019s project manager during its completion. He was buried only a stone\u2019s throw from the pyramid in a tomb in Giza\u2019s eastern cemetery.\n Merer and Dedi\u2019s records help us to flesh out the geography of lower Egypt and the network of canals and harbours that enabled the movement of stones, workers and supplies to the pyramid site. The teams were highly skilled and versatile, not only moving material for the pyramid and temples, but also engaging in storehouse management, potentially constructing a dock in the Delta and taking part in mining missions to Sinai. Merer and Dedi\u2019s logbooks and the accounts books were left behind at Wadi al-Jarf, possibly after the crew\u2019s final assignment there at a time when the Red Sea could be navigated. The site was closed, and operations under Khufu\u2019s successor, Khafre, took place at Ain Sukhna to the north.\n The survival of these documents is extraordinary, as is the unique sapshot they provide of the lives of dozens of workmen who were witnesses to the construction of a wonder of the ancient world. The personnel lists, delivery slips and other accounting documents are still to be published and they will surely add even more to our understanding, all of which we will be reading through the pens of Merer, Dedi and their colleagues.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 15:17:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u4eba,record,khufu", "title": "\u7eaa\u5ff5\u7891\u7eaa\u5f55\uff1a\u5efa\u9020\u5409\u8428\u4f1f\u5927\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u751f\u6d3b", "title_en": "Monumental Record: the lives of the workers building the Great Pyramid of Giza", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/monumental-record", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u4eba", "record", "khufu"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "706f995542453c714dcde073d8b7f78d.jpg", "infoid": 1072734, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u66f4\u6539\u662f70\u5e74\u5185\u5b98\u65b9\u5199\u4f5c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc770\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\uff0c\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u4f53\u80b2\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u51b3\u5b9a\u505a\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u662f\u6b63\u5f0f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u65e5\u672c\u653f\u5e9c\u5de5\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u53f7\u548c\u611f\u53f9\u53f7\u3002\n\u25bc\u4e0a\u8863\uff1aAnata Wa Ramen Wo Tabemashita./You Ate Ramen\u3002\u5e95\u90e8\uff1aAnata Wa Ramen Wo Tabemashita Ka./did\u4f60\u5403\u62c9\u9762\u5417\uff1f\u5728\u6b63\u7edf\u7684\u65e5\u8bed\u5199\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53e5\u5b50\u90fd\u4ee5\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\n\u8be5\u90e8\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e0a\u5468\u4e94\u65b0\u7684\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5b83\u627f\u8ba4\uff0c\u95ee\u53f7\u548c\u611f\u53f9\u53f7\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u8513\u5ef6\u5230\u653f\u5e9c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u597d\u7684\u3002", "note_en": "Change is part of  first update to Guidelines for Official Writing Composition in 70 years.\n  The Japanese government has something called the  kouyoubun sakusei no youryou, or the \u201c Guidelines for Official Writing Composition.\u201d It\u2019s basically a set of writing protocols for government documents and public notices, and it hasn\u2019t been updated in a long time.  The last overhaul happened all the way back in 1952, when documents were first officially allowed to be written horizontally instead of the more classical vertical orientation of Japanese text.\n But after 70 years, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has decided to make some changes, and one of the biggest is  officially giving Japanese government workers permission to use question marks and exclamation points.\n Up until now the Guidelines made no mention of question marks or exclamation points, with the implication being that, in principle, neither was to be used. That might seem like a major obstacle for written communication, but neither punctuation mark is indigenous to the Japanese language, and so there are other ways to express the concepts. For example, when forming questions in Japanese, the syllable  ka is tacked on to the end of a sentence, and so writing  ka, \u304b in the Japanese language\u2019s phonetic hiragana script, conveys that a question is being asked.\n \u25bc Top:  Anata wa ramen wo tabemashita./You ate ramen. Bottom:  Anata wa ramen wo tabemashita ka./Did you eat ramen? In orthodox Japanese writing, both sentences end with a period.\n  However, the updated guidelines, which were drafted by the Ministry\u2019s Council for Cultural Affairs, recognize that there are times when the inclusion of a question mark or exclamation point can make the meaning or emotion of a sentence clearer, such as rendering a conversation in written form, and so they\u2019re now cleared for use in documents, public notices, and public awareness/PR campaigns.\n The Ministry announced the new Guidelines last Friday, and while it admits that question marks and exclamation points had already begun creeping into government compositions, they\u2019re now got the official OK.\n Source:  Agency for Cultural Affairs via  Yomiuri Shimbun Online via  Livedoor News via  Jin  Top image:  Pakutaso (edited by SoraNews24)  Insert image: SoraNews24  \u25cf Want to hear about SoraNews24\u2019s latest articles as soon as they\u2019re published?

It was a Vitamix blender, a professional-grade splurge, and the couple was looking forward to a winter of smoothies and soups.\n  It arrived on Dec. 16 at their home on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Jessica put the hefty box down on the floor in the kitchen, just for a second. Her 4-year-old tuxedo cat, Max, otherwise known as the \u201csentient soccer ball,\u201d jumped up on the box. Jessica thought it was funny and snapped a photo.\n Then Max\u2019s 13-year-old feline siblings, George: Destroyer of Worlds (\u201csentient potato\u201d) and Lando Calrissian (\u201cthe questionably sentient dust bunny,\u201d), demanded their turn on the knee-high box.\n That was more than three weeks ago. Since then, the cats have refused to leave the box, fighting over who gets to perch upon it and taking turns standing guard while the others eat or are busy elsewhere. The blender remains ensconced inside.\n  The Gerson-Neeveses, who refer to themselves as \u201cthe middle-aged lesbians,\u201d documented the standoff, taking photos and posting daily updates on Facebook, specifically in the 900,000-plus-member group \u201c THIS CAT IS C H O N K Y.\u201d The hostage situation has drawn thousands of comments from those who know the \u201cbut the cat was on it!\u201d explanation all too well.\n   \u201cSTANDOFF: Day (are you KIDDING me) 4: The situation has come full circle as the sentient soccer ball took advantage of a moment of distraction by the sentient potato and reclaimed the Vitamix, immediately adopting a posture suggesting that he came to eat treats and bitchslap any lesbians who try to come for the Vitamix, and he\u2019s all out of treats,\u201d wrote Jessica, a psychologist and the writer of most of the updates. \u201cOne of the middle-aged lesbians appears to have locked herself in the bathroom; the other was heard in fervent prayer to the patron saint of all queer cat lovers, [Freddie] Mercury. \u201d\n The couple, who married in 2016, are accustomed to seeing their cats jump on boxes and sit on piles of things. The animals usually lose interest after a day or two at most. Not this time.\n Treats, decoy boxes and toys have been used, all for naught. The Gerson-Neeveses moved the box to a less-central area of the kitchen, hoping the change in geography would end the stalemate. But a cat remained on the box, on guard at all times. Jessica got up in the middle of the night to try to claim the box. Occupied.\n   \u201cThere is just something about the Vitamix box that just has really held their attention,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s turned into something so much bigger than us.\u201d\n People frequently ask why the couple doesn\u2019t just take the cats off the box. These are clearly dog owners. This is not how cats work.\n \u201cWe\u2019re far enough into it, I can\u2019t move them  now,\u201d said Nikii, 38, a utility billing clerk. \u201cThey\u2019re committed, we\u2019re committed. \u201d\n  They hoped that while they were away over Christmas that the cats would lose interest. The Gerson-Neeveses came home, put their bags on the floor and \u2014 nope. The Vitamix had not been abandoned. At one point, they coaxed Max into jumping onto a second box, but as soon as he leaped off, Lando jumped on. Max was not happy and quickly reclaimed the spotlight. The couple gave up on smoothies and started eating homemade ice cream.\n On Jan. 2, the couple reached out to Vitamix on a public Facebook post, asking for three empty boxes that might fool the cats into relinquishing the appliance. The company immediately obliged, but between snowstorms and customs, the empty boxes have yet to arrive \u2014 and Nikii and Jessica aren\u2019t quite sure how the boxes will fit in their small apartment, much less if they will satisfy the cats.\n  But the duo and their many followers are happy to let the battle run its course.\n   The truth is, the couple says, this could be easily resolved. The cats are not particularly heavy.

The startup focuses primarily on small and medium companies as well as freelancers. It currently operates in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n Tiger Global and  TCV are leading today\u2019s funding round. With 220,000 clients, Qonto still plans to grow at a rapide pace in the coming years. \u201cOur goal is to reach one million SMEs by 2025,\u201d co-founder and CEO Alexandre Prot told me. \u201cAnd we know that Tiger and TCV have supported quite a few companies to reach that scale.\u201d\n  Some new investors are also participating in the round, such as Alkeon, Eurazeo, KKR, Insight Partners, Exor Seeds, Guillaume Pousaz, Gaingels and Ashley Flucas. Existing investors Valar, Alven, DST Global and Tencent are putting more money on the table as well.\n That\u2019s quite a long list of investors and Qonto proves once again that private equity firms are actively looking for late-stage growth rounds in Europe.\n   What\u2019s interesting with Qonto is that it\u2019s a truly European startup. In the U.S., spend management solutions, such as  Brex and  Ramp, have been massively successful. As The Information\u2019s Kate Clark reported, they want to  replace American Express and hand out corporate cards to millions of employees in the U.S.\n Qonto started out with business bank accounts because that\u2019s the key financial component of European companies. Many companies use their bank accounts directly to move money around. They initiate transfers, share their bank account number (IBAN) to receive a payment and set up direct debits to pay bills.\n And Qonto does that really well. You can sign up from a computer and get a local IBAN a few minutes later. After that, you can also order debit cards to pay with your card.\n At first, Qonto relied heavily on a third-party banking partner \u2014  Treezor. The startup then applied to get its own license to become a payment institution. In 2020, Qonto moved all its clients to its in-house core banking system. The company now owns this critical part of the technical stack.\n Qonto has expanded beyond the simple bank account. The startup\u2019s CEO Alexandre Prot defines Qonto as three different products rolled into a single service. In addition to the everyday banking part, it also simplifies bookkeeping and accounting. It can become your spend management solution as well.\n On the bookkeeping front, Qonto lets you export or sync with your  existing accounting solution. This is a fragmented market as each country uses different accounting tools. For instance, you can export your data to Cegid if you\u2019re a French company, you can synchronize with Datev if you\u2019re a German company, etc. Qonto users can also import receipts directly in their Qonto account.\n As for spend management, Qonto lets you hand out physical, virtual or one-time cards to employees. Admins can set up different spending limits, an approval workflow and all the usual stuff that you get from a spend management solution. It might not be as feature complete as a dedicated product, such as  Spendesk, but it could be enough for small companies.\n For everything else, Qonto partners with other fintech startups. For instance, customers can open a credit line with  October and borrow \u20ac15,000 to \u20ac30,000. Customers can also open a savings account with  Cashbee and its banking partner My Money Bank.\n   There are 220,000 companies paying for Qonto every month. Pricing ranges from \u20ac9 per month for the most basic freelancer account to \u20ac249 per month for enterprise accounts. On top of that, some companies pay more to get more cards or when they go above certain limits.\n What makes the business model even more lucrative is that a lot of customers just sign up on their own. When they create their company, they use Qonto for the initial capital deposit in order to register the company. Essentially, Qonto combines inbound marketing with the high margins of a SaaS product.\n \u201cAround a third of our customers created their companies with us. It\u2019s their first account and the only one that they use,\u201d Alexandre Prot said. \u201cTwo-thirds of our customers are companies that existed before they opened an account with us. Roughly half of them close their existing bank account, half of them use Qonto in parallel with one or several accounts.\u201d\n With today\u2019s funding round, the company plans to grow its team from 500 employees to 2,000 people by 2025. Qonto will also invest heavily in its existing markets. \u201cWe will be able to invest more than \u20ac100 million on each of our markets,\u201d Prot said. While there are still a lot of SMEs that are not using Qonto in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, Qonto also plans to enter new market in 2023.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 13:58:08", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5546\u4e1a,\u4e1a\u52a1,billion", "title": "\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u542f\u52a8Qonto\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86552\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee550\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u4ef7", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBusiness banking startup Qonto raises $552 million at $5 billion valuation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5546\u4e1a", "\u4e1a\u52a1", "billion"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5fe52fdbbbce1c67cec2ababda465405.jpg", "infoid": 1072731, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u5de8\u578b\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u96c6\u56e2\u548c\u4ebf\u4e07\u5bcc\u7fc1Kumar Mangalam Birla\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\u7ea6\u4e3a67.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u80a1\u6743\u540e\uff0c\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u80a1\u6743\u5c06\u7a00\u91ca\u81f328.5\uff05\uff0c\u800cAditya Birla\u96c6\u56e2\u5c06\u7f29\u5c0f\u523017.8\uff05\u3002\u5370\u5ea6\u653f\u5e9c\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\u3002\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546Bharti Airtel\u4e5f\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\uff0c\u4e0a\u5468\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8f6c\u6362\u5ef6\u671f\u9891\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u5229\u606f\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6551\u63f4\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56JIO\u7684\u5230\u6765\u53d7\u4f24\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7531\u4e9a\u6d32\u6700\u5bcc\u6709\u7684\u4ebaMukesh Ambani\u906d\u5230\u524a\u5f31\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc74\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u3002\nAirtel\u548cVodafone Idea\u5728\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u7684140\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4e0a\u5bfb\u6c42\u6551\u6d4e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bf7\u6c42\u53bb\u5e74\u5370\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u9a73\u56de\u4e86\u3002\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u60f3\u6cd5\u9ad8\u7ba1\u53bb\u5e749\u6708\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5e0c\u671b\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u652f\u4ed8\u4f1a\u8d39\u3002", "note_en": "The operator, which is a joint venture between the British giant Vodafone Group and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla\u2019s conglomerate, owed the government dues of roughly $6.76 billion.\u00a0Following the conversion into equity, Vodafone Group\u2019s shareholding will be diluted to 28.5% while Aditya Birla Group\u2019s will shrink to 17.8%. The Indian government will become the largest shareholder in the wireless telecom operator.\n Shares of Vodafone Idea dropped 12.46% on the news and was trading at \u20b913 apiece at 11 am local time.\n  Bharti Airtel, the second largest telecom operator which also owes dues to the government, said last week it won\u2019t be converting the interest on deferred spectrum related payments and government dues into equity.\n Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes months after the Indian government gave operators more time to pay dues on  a two-decade dispute last year. (The Indian government and telecom operators have for a decade disputed how gross revenue should be calculated. The government has mandated the license and spectrum fee to be paid by operators as a share of their revenue. Telcos had argued that only core income accrued from use of spectrum should be considered for calculation of adjusted gross revenue.)\n The rescue plan, nonetheless, was critical to both the telecom operators who have been hurt by the arrival of Reliance Jio, run by Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, which undercut their offerings to become the top Indian telecom operator with over 400 million subscribers.\n Many private phone operators exited the market, merged with rivals, or filed for bankruptcy after Jio lured away subscribers with cheap data and free calls. Vodafone Idea hasn\u2019t reported annual profits since 2017.\n  Airtel and Vodafone Idea had sought relief on the $14 billion they owe to the government, a plea the Indian Supreme Court rejected last year. Vodafone Idea executives said in September last year that the company was hopeful of successfully raising funds to pay the dues.\n Analysts were expecting that Vodafone Idea won\u2019t have to resort to diluting its dues into equity. \u201cWith the recent ~20% tariff hikes and Vi having likely tied up the funding for repaying the non-convertible debentures maturing between December 2021 and February 2022, its prospects have improved. In our view, Vi is likely to continue its fund-raising efforts from its promoters and other investors rather than letting the government acquire a significant stake,\u201d brokerage firm IIFL said Monday.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 13:57:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30,idea,\u96c6\u56e2", "title": "\u5728\u4f1a\u8d39\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u5728\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u4e2d\u62e5\u670935.8\uff05", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia to own 35.8% in Vodafone Idea after conversion of dues\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/vodafone-idea-india-government/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30", "idea", "\u96c6\u56e2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a25414c340ca8beb7ea56829ba2f6456.jpg", "infoid": 1072730, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4e00\u65e5\u665a\u4e0a\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u6c61\u96e8\u4e0a\uff0c\u5df4\u897f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08Eduarda Martins Delcourt\u6b63\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u5357\u91cc\u5965\u5fb7\u00b7\u6770\u5c3c\u7f57\u6765\u5230\u5979\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u5723\u8bde\u8282\u3002\u5979\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b2\u52a8\u662f\u6253\u5f00\u5979\u7684\u4f18\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cMartins Delcourt\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8ba9\u5979\u7684\u5988\u5988\u4f7f\u7528Taxi.Rio\u8ba2\u8d2d\u4e86\u5979\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5ba4\uff0c\u7531\u91cc\u7ea6\u70ed\u5185\u5362\u653f\u5e9c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u9a91\u624b\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u3002 Taxi.Rio\u6536\u53d6\u4e8618\u5c81\u7684Reais\uff08\u7ea6\u54082.80\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u9a91\u884c -

Her first impulse was to open her Uber app.\n Uber indicated that the 15-minute trip would set her back 40 reais (around $7) \u2014 more than double what she had remembered paying for a similar trip just a couple years back.\n So, Martins Delcourt closed the app and had her mom order her a cab using Taxi.Rio, an app developed by the Rio de Janeiro government to connect riders to the traditional taxi service. Taxi.Rio charged just 18 reais (around $2.80) for the same ride \u2014 less than half of what Uber was asking.\n Martins Delcourt is part of a growing number of Brazilians ditching Uber for taxis, which are now becoming cheaper and easier to come by. According to the Union of Autonomous Taxi Drivers of the Municipality of Rio, demand for Rio taxi services, which now operate in a number of cities across Brazil, rose by  60% at the tail end of 2021. Taxi.Rio added roughly 38,000 monthly users in 2021, according to official Rio city government figures.\n Meanwhile, statistics from the state of Rio de Janeiro found that traditional taxis clocked around 226,800,000 completed trips in 2021, compared to 136,080,000 in the same period the previous year, claimed Rodrigo Lopes Cosendey, the general secretary of Rio Niteroi Municipality Taxi Driver\u2019s Union.\n Monthly completed trips in Brazil for Uber and 99, owned by Chinese tech giant DiDi, have not been disclosed to the public, but they are believed to have 28 million active users combined \u2013\u2013 approximately  90% of the Brazilian population \u2013\u2013\u00a0with 99 boasting 750,000 active drivers, compared to Uber\u2019s over 600,000.\n In recent years though, new, lesser-known competitors, like Taxi.Rio and  Lady Driver, have captured around 8% of Brazilian users.\n The shift back to traditional cabs was spurred in large part by pricing and longer wait times. Uber and 99 are grappling with driver shortages and high demand, which has translated to price surcharges, including a 30% increase over two months last fall, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n Andreia Santos, another Rio native, told  Rest of World that Uber charged her almost 150 reais (around $27) for a roughly 30-minute trip on New Year\u2019s eve. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of my weekly grocery trip,\u201d she said.\n   Meanwhile, taxi cab prices across Brazil are set by local authorities and have seen minimal increases over the past three years. And populous urban centers like Rio de Janeiro have recently invested heavily in apps like Taxi.Rio, which aim to make hailing a cab just as easy as hailing an Uber. This has meant that Brazilians have gradually begun to find traditional taxis are often cheaper and more convenient alternatives than private ride-hailing apps.\n \u201cGiven the increased demand for trips, there are many who are returning to taxis or even discovering them for the first time,\u201d Alessandro Ruiz Martinez, a leader of the National Taxi Front (Frennataxi), a union, told  Rest of World.\n A surging demand for rides and a limited pool of drivers have led to recent surges in Uber prices in  England and the  U.S., among other countries. But in Brazil, ride-hailing apps are in a particular bind because of spiking inflation, largely driven by high fuel prices.\n In Rio de Janeiro, as in the rest of Brazil, where the majority of drivers use  gasoline to fill their tanks, the price of gas has soared  by up to 46% in 2021. Natural gas had also risen by nearly  40% in 2021.\n For drivers, the addition of exorbitant gas prices to the cost of the ride-hailing companies\u2019 30% cut can be discouraging. \u201cIf it\u2019s a short trip, it\u2019s just not worth accepting the fare,\u201d Wilson Lucas, a 22-year-old driving for both Uber and 99 in Rio, told  Rest of World. He drives 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and takes home an average of under 1,900 reais (around $337) in a good month.\n And that money is worth less and less every day. While yearly inflation as measured by consumer price index is at 6.8% and 7.37% in the U.S. and Mexico respectively, Brazil is grappling with a 10.74% rate. Though surging gas prices affect both Uber and taxi drivers equally, Rio cabbies make a monthly base salary of 4,500 reais (approx $800), says Cosendey of the Taxi Union and can take home most of what they make on the road \u2014 Rio City Hall takes only a 5% cut, as opposed to the private apps\u2019  10%\u201335% commission.\n  Metered taxi fares are also determined by the regional municipality in advance, operating on what is known locally as the \u201c Bandeira 2\u201d system, where fares can increase by as much as  20%\u201340% during busy peak periods, like bank holidays and Saturday nights. Unlike the apps\u2019 dynamic pricing model, however, trip prices increase during fixed times.\n Uber, which still maintains  70% of the rider share market in Brazil, is improving its service to draw riders back. In September, the company banned 1,600 drivers from using its service for excessive cancellations. The company is also hoping to attract new talent and told  Rest of World that it was seeking to keep drivers on the road by instituting cashback schemes for health care and mobile plans, as well as at the fuel pump \u2014 although the refueling incentive adds up to just 600 reais (just over $100) a year.\n Still, municipal efforts like Taxi.Rio are putting up a fight. Launched in 2017, Taxi.Rio has something that private ride-hailing apps do not: local regulations that favor the local taxi service. For instance, the Rio government has offered cabs on Taxi.Rio the freedom to use  express bus lanes, which can drastically cut trip fares and times.\n The mayor has also  announced plans to tax private car-hailing apps, such as Uber, at a rate of 1.5% for using public roadways as part of a wider smart city initiative to reduce congestion. Taxi.Rio, legally designated as public transport, was exempted from the regulation.\n According to the Rio government\u2019s official figures, Taxi.Rio currently has 33,000 active drivers;  80% of the Rio state\u2019s 90,000 traditional taxi drivers are currently registered on the app. Between October and November last year, when Brazil grappled with two months of double-digit inflation, Taxi.Rio also reported an 8% increase in passengers and a 26% surge in completed trips, Kley Pontes, the main technical coordinator of IplanRio, Rio\u2019s municipal computer company, told  Rest of World.\n Edson Neves, a taxi driver who began working at Uber when the company first arrived in Brazil, made the move back to traditional taxis three months ago, when he realized that drivers\u2019 costs had increased while their workers\u2019 rights had diminished drastically, in the past year.\n For analysts, the question is how and whether Taxi.Rio will be able to maintain momentum beyond the specific moment of driver shortages, inflation, and the unemployment crisis in Brazil.\n  For Pedro Paulo Albuquerque, CEO at a Bras\u00edlia-based technology startup named Skill, the apps\u2019 current bottlenecks have offered an additional option for segments of the Brazilian population seeking express rides \u2014 particularly during rush hour, rainy days, and airport trips. However, he doesn\u2019t see state-backed ride-hailing alternatives replacing private apps. \u201cFor Taxi.Rio to truly prosper, it needs easy access and the ability to develop high-performance technology that goes beyond what a government department is capable of.\u201d\n Still, Neves won\u2019t be going back to Uber or 99 anytime soon, even if inflation subsides. \u201cWorking as a taxi driver is a profession, [with Taxi.Rio] we have security,\u201d he said.\n Yet Lucas, the 22-year-old Uber and 99 driver, says he\u2019ll wait it out. For him and many more struggling Brazilians accustomed to informal labor, the flexibility of working on the private apps \u2014 something that Taxi.Rio does not offer \u2014 has helped them when few employment alternatives are available. If prospects improve in the city, however, he dreams of one day completing his course in the military.

Can the 36 officers be arranged in a 6-by-6 square so that no row or column repeats a rank or regiment?\n The puzzle is easily solved when there are five ranks and five regiments, or seven ranks and seven regiments. But after searching in vain for a solution for the case of 36 officers, Euler concluded that \u201csuch an arrangement is impossible, though we can\u2019t give a rigorous demonstration of this.\u201d More than a century later, the French mathematician Gaston Tarry proved that, indeed, there was no way to arrange Euler\u2019s 36 officers in a 6-by-6 square without repetition. In 1960, mathematicians used computers to  prove that solutions exist for any number of regiments and ranks greater than two, except, curiously, six.\n Similar puzzles have entranced people for more than 2,000 years. Cultures around the world have made \u201cmagic squares,\u201d arrays of numbers that add to the same sum along each row and column, and \u201cLatin squares\u201d filled with symbols that each appear once per row and column. These squares have been used in art and urban planning, and just for fun. One popular Latin square \u2014 Sudoku \u2014 has subsquares that also lack repeating symbols. Euler\u2019s 36 officers puzzle asks for an \u201corthogonal Latin square,\u201d in which two sets of properties, such as ranks and regiments, both satisfy the rules of the Latin square simultaneously.\n  But whereas Euler thought no such 6-by-6 square exists, recently the game has changed. In  a paper posted online and submitted to  Physical Review Letters, a group of quantum physicists in India and Poland demonstrates that it is possible to arrange 36 officers in a way that fulfills Euler\u2019s criteria \u2014 so long as the officers can have a quantum mixture of ranks and regiments. The result is the latest in a line of work developing quantum versions of magic square and Latin square puzzles, which is not just fun and games, but has applications for quantum communication and quantum computing.\n \u201cI think their paper is very beautiful,\u201d said  Gemma De las Cuevas, a quantum physicist at the University of Innsbruck who was not involved with the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of quantum magic in there. And not only that, but you can feel throughout the paper their love for the problem.\u201d\n The new era of quantum puzzling began in 2016, when  Jamie Vicary of the University of Cambridge and his then-student Ben Musto had the idea that the entries appearing in Latin squares could be made quantum.\n  In quantum mechanics, objects such as electrons can be in a \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple possible states: here and there, for example, or magnetically oriented both up and down. (Quantum objects stay in this limbo until they are measured, at which point they settle on one state.) Entries of quantum Latin squares are also quantum states that can be in quantum superpositions. Mathematically, a quantum state is represented by a vector, which has a length and direction, like an arrow. A superposition is the arrow formed by combining multiple vectors. Analogous to the requirement that symbols along each row and column of a Latin square not repeat, the quantum states along each row or column of a quantum Latin square must correspond to vectors that are perpendicular to one another.\n Quantum Latin squares were quickly adopted by a community of theoretical physicists and mathematicians interested in their unusual properties. Last year, the French mathematical physicists  Ion Nechita and Jordi Pillet created a quantum version of Sudoku \u2014  SudoQ. Instead of using the integers 0 through 9, in SudoQ the rows, columns and subsquares each have nine perpendicular vectors.\n These advances led  Adam Burchardt, a postdoctoral researcher at Jagiellonian University in Poland, and his colleagues to reexamine Euler\u2019s old puzzle about the 36 officers. What if, they wondered, Euler\u2019s officers were made quantum?\n In the classical version of the problem, each entry is an officer with a well-defined rank and regiment. It\u2019s helpful to conceive of the 36 officers as colorful chess pieces, whose rank can be\u00a0 king, queen, rook, bishop, knight or pawn, and whose regiment is represented by red, orange, yellow, green, blue or purple. But in the quantum version, officers are formed from superpositions of ranks and regiments. An officer could be a superposition of a red king and an orange queen, for instance.\n Critically, the quantum states that compose these officers have a special relationship called entanglement, which involves a correlation between different entities. If a red king is entangled with an orange queen, for instance, then even if the king and queen are both in superpositions of multiple regiments, observing that the king is red tells you immediately that the queen is orange. It\u2019s because of the peculiar nature of entanglement that officers along each line can all be perpendicular.\n  The theory seemed to work, but to prove it, the authors had to construct a 6-by-6 array filled with quantum officers. A vast number of possible configurations and entanglements meant they had to rely on computer help. The researchers plugged in a classical near-solution (an arrangement of 36 classical officers with only a few repeats of ranks and regiments in a row or column) and applied an algorithm that tweaked the arrangement toward a true quantum solution. The algorithm works a little like solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube with brute force, where you fix the first row, then the first column, second column and so on. When they repeated the algorithm over and over, the puzzle array cycled closer and closer to being a true solution. Eventually, the researchers reached a point where they could see the pattern and fill in the few remaining entries by hand.\n Euler was, in a sense, proved wrong \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t have known, in the 18th century, about the possibility of quantum officers.\n \u201cThey close the book on this problem, which is already very nice,\u201d said Nechita. \u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful result and I like the way they obtain it.\u201d\n One surprising feature of their solution, according to the coauthor Suhail Rather, a physicist at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, was that officer ranks are entangled only with adjacent ranks (kings with queens, rooks with bishops, knights with pawns) and regiments with adjacent regiments. Another surprise was the coefficients that appear in the entries of the quantum Latin square. These coefficients are numbers that tell you, essentially, how much weight to give different terms in a superposition. Curiously, the ratio of the coefficients that the algorithm landed on was \u03a6, or 1.618\u2026, the famous golden ratio.\n The solution is also what\u2019s known as an Absolutely Maximally Entangled state (AME), an arrangement of quantum objects that\u2019s thought to be important for a number of applications including quantum error-correction \u2014 ways of redundantly storing information in quantum computers so that it survives even if there\u2019s data corruption. In an AME, correlations between measurements of quantum objects are as strong as they can be: If Alice and Bob have entangled coins, and Alice tosses her coin and gets heads, she knows for sure that Bob has tails, and vice versa. Two coins can be maximally entangled, and so can three, but not four: If Carol and Dave join the coin toss, Alice can never be sure what Bob gets.\n  The new research proves, however, that if you have a set of four entangled dice, rather than coins, these can be maximally entangled. The arrangement of the six-sided dice is equivalent to the 6-by-6 quantum Latin square. Because of the golden ratio\u2019s presence in their solution, the researchers have dubbed this a \u201cGolden AME.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s highly nontrivial,\u201d said De las Cuevas. \u201cNot only that it exists, but they provide the state explicitly and analyze it.\u201d\n Researchers have previously devised other AMEs by starting with classical error-correcting codes and finding analogous, quantum versions. But the newfound golden AME is different, with no classical cryptographic analogue. Burchardt suspects it could be the first of a new class of quantum error-correcting codes. Then again, it might be equally interesting if the golden AME remains unique.\n Correction: January 10, 2022  T his article originally identified Suhail Rather as a mathematician, when in fact he is a physicist.\n Editor\u2019s note: The author of this article is related to an editor at\u00a0Physical Review Letters , where the quantum Latin squares paper has been submitted for publication.

Chopped and processed fruits are exempt from the ban.\n There are a lot of things wrong with our (over)use of plastic.\u00a0 Pollution from discarded plastic is a major concern.\u00a0 As we all know, both large pieces of plastic and microplastic particles can have nasty environmental effects.\u00a0 The other big problem with plastic is that it is mostly made from fossil fuels; carbon-rich materials that we should be leaving in the ground.\n  There\u2019s a reason we started using plastic to pack food last century: it is very good at protecting food during transport, storage and display. It protects food from spoilage, from damage and from contamination.\u00a0 Plastic packaging makes it easier for manufacturers, retailers and consumers to transport, store and display and buy food. Compared to non-plastic alternatives, plastic packaging is lighter, cheaper, more impact-resistant and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 more appealing to consumers.\n Products like mass-produced bread rely on plastic packaging to retain moisture so they stay fresher for longer.\u00a0 Without plastic, many staple foods like mass-produced bread, which feeds millions of people every day, would be much more difficult to transport and display in our stores. \u00a0And they would suffer from much shorter shelf lives as well.\n I have three big reasons for loving plastic.\u00a0 My number one reason is its ability to keep food fresher for longer, which reduces food waste.\n Secondly, plastic is also effective at retaining nutrients in food.\u00a0 Compared to other packaging materials like glass and metal cans, plastic packaging needs less energy to make and transport, but can be equally effective at retaining nutrients. Frozen vegetables: I\u2019m looking at you.\n My third reason for loving plastic is a little controversial. This sounds crazy, but it\u2019s got to do with the global greenhouse effect. Plastic is an excellent store for carbon.\u00a0 The very same attribute that makes plastic such a long-lived pollutant makes it an effective means of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. Plastic is mostly carbon, and it (mostly) doesn\u2019t biodegrade, which means it isn\u2019t converted back into carbon dioxide when it becomes waste.\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n  Plastic is made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, either from crude oil or natural gas.\u00a0 More specifically, the building blocks of plastics are produced from the naphtha fraction when crude oil is refined, or from the ethane and propane components of natural gas.\n As a result, when we make plastic, we are using carbon from fossil fuels, carbon that \u2013 from a greenhouse effect perspective \u2013 should have been left underground.\n Of course, humans don\u2019t extract fossil fuels just to make plastic.\u00a0 The part of fossil fuels used for olefin plastics \u2013 which are by far the most common type of plastic - are different to the components (\u201cfractions\u201d) we use for other purposes, such as diesel fuel, town gas, heating oil and bitumen. \u00a0So, for as long as we are extracting fossil carbon for those purposes, we have access to a cheap and easy supply of components for plastics.\n Much of the fossil carbon we extract from the ground gets released into the atmosphere when we burn it for fuel; think gasoline, aviation fuel, heating oil and cooking gas.\u00a0 If we are going to extract oil and gas, we may as well turn some of it into stuff that doesn\u2019t get burnt, like plastic.\n Not all plastic ends up in our oceans.\u00a0 While single use plastics create litter and pollution, we also make plastic items that can last a lifetime. Plastic is used in building construction, pipes, cars (16% of an average European car is plastic, by one estimate), carpets and clothing.\u00a0 The longer a piece of plastic remains intact, unburnt, and not bio-degraded, the longer the carbon it contains is locked up and not contributing to the greenhouse effect. In these forms, it is an excellent, stable store of carbon.\n An even better way to store carbon in plastic is to use atmospheric carbon dioxide to manufacture it.\u00a0 We already have the technology to create plastic from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This can be done using biological processes like plants or algae, where photosynthesis is used to extract the carbon dioxide from the air, or by using synthetic processes powered by renewable electricity.\n Right now, these methods are not economically feasible, but that will change when demand for fossil fuels decreases.\u00a0 Less than ten percent of global oil production is used for making plastic, so we should expect higher prices for the plastic-producing fractions of crude oil as oil extraction diminishes. The changing economics of fossil fuel production is going to have a significant impact on the traditional plastic industry.\n Plastic is a major pollutant, but it\u2019s also an overlooked carbon storage solution. We need to capture food packaging plastics before they pollute our oceans or break-down into microplastics.\u00a0 We can capture and bury them in properly designed landfill (not ideal but better than most other options) or recycle them into new items.\u00a0 It\u2019s my fervent hope that in the future virgin plastics will be made using renewable-energy-powered carbon-capture processes.\n  In short: \ud83c\udf4f Plastic makes a great carbon store and helps keep fossil carbon from ending up in our atmosphere: crazy but true! \ud83c\udf4f Also, France banned single use plastic packaging for fruit and veg \ud83c\udf4f\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (I don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)", "posttime": "2022-01-11 12:57:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5851\u6599,plastic", "title": "\u8d5e\u7f8e\u5851\u6599\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5851\u6599\u9002\u5408\u73af\u5883\uff09", "title_en": "In Praise of Plastic (Why Plastic Is Good for the Environment)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://therottenapple.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-plastic", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5851\u6599", "plastic"]}]
