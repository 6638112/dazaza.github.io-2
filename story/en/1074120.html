Henry Dotstry lay on a cot, his gray curls puffed on a pillow. Fakorede smelled the circumstances — a rancid whiff, like dead mice. He asked a nurse to undress the wound on Dotstry’s left foot, then slipped on nitrile gloves to examine the damage. Dotstry’s calf had swelled to nearly the size of his thigh. The tops of his toes were dark; his sole was yellow, oozing. Fakorede’s gut clenched.  Fuck, he thought.  It’s rotten.</p><p>这是一个星期五的晚上，在经历了一周特别辛苦的工作后，密西西比州玻利瓦尔县唯一的心脏病专家福卢索·法科雷德医生走进336号房。亨利·多斯特里躺在帆布床上，灰色的卷发在枕头上蓬松。法科雷德闻到了周围的环境——一股恶臭，就像死老鼠一样。他让一名护士解开多特瑞左脚的伤口，然后戴上丁腈手套检查伤口。多斯特里的小腿肿胀得几乎和大腿一样大。他的脚趾尖是黑色的；他的脚底是黄色的，渗出水来。法科雷德的肠子紧绷着。操，他想。烂透了。</p><p> Fakorede, who’d been asked to consult on the case, peeled off his gloves and read over Dotstry’s chart: He was 67, never smoked. His ultrasound results showed that the circulation in his legs was poor. Uncontrolled diabetes, it seemed, had constricted the blood flow to his foot, and without it, the infection would not heal. A surgeon had typed up his recommendation. It began: “Mr. Dotstry has limited options.”</p><p>法科雷德被要求就此案进行咨询，他脱下手套，仔细阅读了多斯特里的图表：他67岁，从不吸烟。他的超声波检查结果显示他的腿部血液循环不良。不受控制的糖尿病似乎限制了他足部的血液流动，没有它，感染就无法治愈。一位外科医生把他的推荐信打了出来。它的开头是：“多特瑞的选择有限。”</p><p> Fakorede scanned the room. He has quick, piercing eyes, a shaved head and, at 38, the frame of an amateur bodybuilder. Dotstry was still. His mouth arched downward, and faint eyebrows sat high above his lids, giving him a look of disbelief. Next to his cot stood a flesh-colored prosthetic, balancing in a black sneaker.</p><p>法科雷德扫视了一下房间。他有一双敏锐的眼睛，剃光头，38岁时，身材酷似业余健美运动员。多斯特里仍然很安静。他的嘴向下拱起，淡淡的眉毛高高地垂在眼睑上方，让他看起来难以置信。在他的小床旁边放着一个肉色的假肢，穿着黑色运动鞋保持平衡。</p><p>    “How’d you lose that other leg?” Fakorede asked. Dotstry was tired, and a stroke had slowed his recall. Diabetes had recently taken his right leg, below the knee. An amputation of his left would leave him in a wheelchair.</p><p>“你是怎么失去另一条腿的？”法科雷德问道。多斯特里累了，一次中风使他的记忆力变慢了。糖尿病最近夺走了他的右腿，膝盖以下。他的左腿截肢会让他坐在轮椅上。</p><p> Fakorede explained that he wasn’t the kind of doctor who cuts. He was there because he could test circulation, get blood flowing, try to prevent any amputation that wasn’t necessary. He hated that doctors hadn’t screened Dotstry earlier — when he’d had the stroke or lost his leg. “Your legs are twins,” he said. “What happens in one happens in the other.”</p><p>法科雷德解释说，他不是那种割伤的医生。他在那里是因为他可以测试血液循环，让血液流动，试图防止任何不必要的截肢。他痛恨医生在他中风或失去双腿的时候没有对Dotsry进行筛查。“你的腿是双胞胎，”他说。“一个发生了什么，另一个也会发生什么。”</p><p> Dotstry needed an immediate angiogram, an imaging test that would show blockages in his arteries. He also needed a revascularization procedure to clean them out, with a thin catheter that shaves plaque and tiny balloons to widen blood vessels. His foot was decaying, fast. Though Fakorede ran an outpatient practice nearby, when doctors consulted him on inpatients at Bolivar Medical Center, the local hospital, he expected to use its facilities.</p><p>多特瑞需要立即进行血管造影，这是一项显示动脉阻塞的成像测试。他还需要一个血管重建程序来清除斑块，用一根细导管刮除斑块，用小气球扩张血管。他的脚在快速腐烂。虽然法科雷德在附近开了一家门诊诊所，但当医生向他咨询当地医院玻利瓦尔医疗中心的住院病人时，他希望使用该中心的设施。</p><p> He asked his nurse to schedule the procedures. But by the time he had driven home to his ranch house on the northern edge of town, he hadn’t received an answer. Nor had he when he woke up on Saturday at 3:30 a.m., as he did every morning. By sunrise, he was restless at his kitchen counter, texting the hospital’s radiology director, explaining the need for an intervention on Monday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Within a few hours, he got a response: “I don’t have the staff or the supplies. I’m sorry.”</p><p>他让护士安排手术时间。但是，当他开车回家到他位于小镇北边的牧场别墅时，他还没有得到答复。周六凌晨3:30醒来时，他也没有像每天早上那样醒来。日出时，他在厨房柜台前焦躁不安，给医院放射科主任发短信，解释周一马丁·路德·金日进行干预的必要性。几个小时后，他得到了回复：“我没有工作人员或物资。对不起。”</p><p> Now Fakorede was mad, walking briskly into his office, dialing friends on speaker phone, pacing around his conference room. He’d been raised in Nigeria, moved to New Jersey as a teenager and had come to practice in Mississippi five years earlier. He’d grown obsessed with legs, infuriated by the toll of amputations on African Americans. His billboards on Highway 61, running up the Delta, announced his ambitions: “Amputation Prevention Institute.”</p><p>现在，法科雷德疯了，他轻快地走进办公室，用扬声器给朋友们打电话，在会议室里踱来踱去。他在尼日利亚长大，十几岁时搬到新泽西州，五年前来到密西西比州训练。他对腿着迷，对非裔美国人截肢的人数感到愤怒。他在三角洲61号公路上的广告牌上宣布了他的抱负：“截肢预防研究所”</p><p> Nobody knew it in January, but within months, the new coronavirus would sweep the United States, killing tens of thousands of people, a disproportionately high number of them black and diabetic. They were at a disadvantage, put at risk by an array of factors, from unequal health care access to racist biases to cuts in public health funding. These elements have long driven disparities, particularly across the South. One of the clearest ways to see them is by tracking who suffers diabetic amputations, which are, by  one measure, the most preventable surgery in the country.</p><p>1月份没人知道，但几个月后，新冠病毒将席卷美国，导致数万人死亡，其中黑人和糖尿病患者的比例过高。他们处于不利地位，受到一系列因素的威胁，从不平等的医疗保健机会到种族主义偏见，再到削减公共卫生资金。这些因素长期以来一直在推动不平等，尤其是在整个南方。观察糖尿病截肢最清晰的方法之一是追踪谁患有糖尿病截肢，从某种程度上说，糖尿病截肢是美国最可预防的手术。</p><p> Look closely enough, and those seemingly intractable barriers are made up of crucial decisions, which layer onto one another: A panel of experts decides not to endorse screening for vascular disease in the legs; so the law allows insurance providers not to cover the tests. The federal government forgives the student loans of some doctors in underserved areas, but not certain specialists; so the physicians most critical to treating diabetic complications are in short supply. Policies written by hospitals, insurers and the government don’t require surgeons to consider limb-saving options before applying a blade; amputations increase, particularly among the poor.</p><p>仔细观察，这些看似难以克服的障碍是由关键决定组成的，这些决定相互影响：一个专家小组决定不支持腿部血管疾病筛查；因此，法律允许保险公司不承担测试费用。联邦政府免除了服务不足地区一些医生的助学贷款，但不免除某些专家的助学贷款；因此，对治疗糖尿病并发症最关键的医生供不应求。医院、保险公司和政府制定的政策不需要外科医生在申请刀片之前考虑肢体拯救方案；截肢人数增加，尤其是在穷人中。</p><p> Despite the great scientific strides in diabetes care, the rate of amputations across the country  grew by 50% between 2009 and 2015. Diabetics undergo 130,000 amputations each year, often in low-income and underinsured neighborhoods. Black patients lose limbs at a rate  triple that of others. It is the cardinal sin of the American health system in a single surgery: save on preventive care, pay big on the backend, and let the chronically sick and underprivileged feel the extreme consequences.</p><p>尽管在糖尿病治疗方面取得了巨大的科学进步，但在2009年至2015年间，全国的截肢率增长了50%。糖尿病患者每年接受13万次截肢手术，通常发生在低收入和保险不足的社区。黑人患者失去四肢的速度是其他人的三倍。在一次手术中，这是美国医疗体系的主要罪过：节省预防性医疗费用，在后端支付高额费用，让慢性病患者和弱势群体感受到极端后果。</p><p>    Fakorede grabbed his car keys and headed to the hospital. He walked straight to the lab. As he suspected, it had all the supplies that he needed.  Why won’t they give me staff? he wondered.  They wouldn’t do that to a surgeon.</p><p>法科雷德抓起车钥匙，前往医院。他径直走向实验室。正如他所怀疑的，实验室里有他所需要的所有用品。他们为什么不给我员工？他想知道。他们不会对外科医生那样做。</p><p> He has little tolerance for this kind of transgression. He is militaristic, to an extreme. To him, nonhealing wounds are like heart attacks. “Time is muscle,” he repeats. He calls huddles when nurses forget to check a patient’s ankles: “If you haven’t assessed both legs, I don’t want to walk into that room.” He considers each of his procedures an act of war. When people stand in his way, he sends a barrage of text messages, punctuated by exclamation marks. And he uses his cellphone to collect evidence that the system is working against his patients, and his efforts.</p><p>他对这种违法行为几乎不能容忍。他是一个极端的军国主义者。对他来说，无法愈合的伤口就像心脏病发作。“时间就是肌肉，”他重复道。当护士们忘记检查病人的脚踝时，他会打电话给大家：“如果你还没有对双腿进行评估，我就不想走进那个房间。”他认为他的每一个步骤都是战争行为。当有人挡住他的去路时，他会发送一连串的短信，并以感叹号为标点。他用手机收集证据，证明该系统对他的病人和他的努力不利。</p><p> He pulled out his iPhone and photographed the hospital’s wires and catheters, IVs and port protectors. He shot the images over to the hospital’s radiology director. Fakorede’s private practice was closed for the holiday weekend. He calculated that he had only a few days to carry out some plan before Dotstry’s remaining leg was amputated.</p><p>他拿出iPhone，给医院的电线、导管、静脉输液器和端口保护器拍照。他向医院的放射科主任拍摄了这些照片。法科雷德的私人诊所因假日周末关闭。他估计，在多斯特里剩下的一条腿被截肢之前，他只有几天的时间来执行一些计划。</p><p>   Two maps explain why Fakorede has stayed in the Mississippi Delta. One shows America’s amputations from vascular disease. The second shows the enslaved population before the Civil War; he saw it at a plantation museum and was stunned by how closely they tracked. On his phone, he pulls up the images, showing doctors, or history buffs, or anyone who will listen. “Look familiar?” he asks, toggling between the maps. He watches the realization set in that amputations are a form of racial oppression, dating back to slavery.</p><p>两张地图解释了法科雷德为什么留在密西西比三角洲。其中一幅展示了美国因血管疾病而截肢的情况。第二幅展示了内战前被奴役的人口；他在一家种植园博物馆看到了它，被他们追踪得如此之近而震惊。他在手机上调出图像，显示医生、历史爱好者或任何愿意倾听的人。“面熟吗？”他问道，在地图之间切换。他看到人们意识到截肢是一种种族压迫，可以追溯到奴隶制时期。</p><p>    Fakorede was initially tempted to move to the Delta while practicing in Tennessee. He befriended a medical device sales rep named Maurice Hampton who had grown up in the Mississippi region. Hampton talked about how black families were leery of local hospitals and how few black doctors in the Delta specialized in vascular work. “It’s the norm to go to Walmart and see an amputation or a permacath in the neck,” he’d told Fakorede. “If you don’t see one, then you didn’t stay but two minutes.”</p><p>法科雷德最初打算在田纳西州练习时搬到三角洲。他与在密西西比州长大的医疗器械销售代表莫里斯·汉普顿成为朋友。汉普顿谈到了黑人家庭对当地医院的戒心，以及三角洲地区专门从事血管工作的黑人医生寥寥无几。他告诉法科雷德：“去沃尔玛看截肢手术或颈部烫伤是很正常的。”。“如果你没看到，那你就只呆了两分钟。”</p><p> Then, a little over a year into his Tennessee job, Fakorede found himself at loose ends. He’d raised concerns that he was being billed for expenses that weren’t his and asked for an audit; though the audit later found that the clinic where he worked had claimed over $314,000 in improper expenses, he was quickly terminated. Fakorede  sued the clinic for retaliation under the False Claims Act and lost. (The clinic’s lawyer said his client had no comment, but there were “numerous” reasons for Fakorede’s departure.) In the spring of 2015, he had a mortgage, a quarter of a million dollars in student debt and four months of severance pay. He also had an impulse to understand the Delta.</p><p>然后，在田纳西州工作一年多一点的时候，法科雷德发现自己陷入了困境。他担心自己的账单不是他的，并要求审计；尽管审计后来发现他工作的诊所报销了超过31.4万美元的不当费用，但他很快就被解雇了。法科雷德根据《虚假索赔法》起诉该诊所进行报复，结果败诉。（该诊所的律师表示，他的当事人对此不予置评，但法科雷德的离开有“许多”原因。）2015年春天，他有抵押贷款、25万美元的学生债务和四个月的遣散费。他也有一种理解三角洲的冲动。</p><p>    Fakorede spent four days driving through its long, flat stretches of farmland dotted with small towns and shotgun houses. The wood-slat homes and bumpy roads reminded him of his grandparents’ village in the Nigerian state of Ondo, where he’d spent summers as a kid. He drove scores of miles on the Mississippi highways without seeing a single grocery store; fast-food chains lit the busiest intersections. He was startled by the markers of disease — the missing limbs and rolling wheelchairs, the hand-built plywood ramps with metal rails. He thought of amputees like “an hourglass,” he said, “that was turned the day they had their amputation.” Mortality rates rise after the surgeries, in part, because many stop walking. Exercise improves circulation and controls blood sugar and weight. The less activity a person does, the higher the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Within five years, these patients were  likely to be dead.</p><p>法科雷德花了四天的时间开车穿过长长的、平坦的农田，那里点缀着小城镇和猎枪房。木条房屋和崎岖不平的道路让他想起了他祖父母在尼日利亚翁多州的村庄，他小时候曾在那里度过夏天。他在密西西比高速公路上开了几十英里，一家杂货店也没看到；快餐连锁店照亮了最繁忙的十字路口。他被疾病的标志物吓了一跳——缺失的四肢和滚动的轮椅，手工建造的带金属栏杆的胶合板坡道。他认为截肢者就像“沙漏”，他说，“截肢者被截肢的那天就变成了沙漏。”手术后死亡率上升，部分原因是许多人停止行走。运动可以改善血液循环，控制血糖和体重。一个人活动越少，心脏病发作和中风的风险就越高。五年内，这些患者很可能已经死亡。</p><p> Fakorede weighed taking a lucrative job up north, near his parents, who had both been diagnosed with diabetes. He had professional connections there; he’d gone to Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and done a residency at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center. But the South, he felt, needed him. About 30 million people in America had diabetes, and Mississippi had some of the highest rates. The vast majority had Type 2; their bodies resisted insulin or their pancreas didn’t produce enough, making their blood sugar levels rise. Genetics played a role in the condition, but so did obesity and nutrition access: high-fat meals, sugary foods and not enough fiber, along with little exercise. Poverty can double the odds of developing diabetes, and it also dictates the chances of an amputation. One major study  mapped diabetic amputations across California, and it found that the lowest-income neighborhoods had amputation rates 10 times higher than the richest.</p><p>法科雷德在北边的父母附近找了一份有利可图的工作，他的父母都被诊断出患有糖尿病。他在那里有职业关系；他曾就读于罗格斯大学罗伯特·伍德·约翰逊医学院，并在纽约长老会威尔·康奈尔医学中心实习。但他觉得南方需要他。美国大约有3000万人患有糖尿病，密西西比州的糖尿病发病率最高。绝大多数为2型；他们的身体抵抗胰岛素或胰腺分泌不足，导致血糖水平升高。遗传因素在这种情况下起了作用，但肥胖和营养获取也起了作用：高脂肪食物、含糖食物和纤维不足，以及很少锻炼。贫困会使患糖尿病的几率翻倍，同时也决定了截肢的几率。一项主要研究绘制了加利福尼亚州糖尿病患者截肢率的分布图，发现收入最低的社区截肢率是最富有社区的10倍。</p><p> The Delta was Mississippi’s poorest region, with the worst health outcomes. Fakorede had spent years studying health disparities: African Americans develop chronic diseases  a decade earlier than their white counterparts; they are  twice as likely to die from diabetes; they live, on average,  three years fewer. In the Delta, Fakorede could treat patients who looked like him; he could find only one other black interventional cardiologist in the entire state. A growing body of evidence had shown how racial biases throughout the medical system meant worse results for African Americans. And he knew the  research — black patients were more responsive to, and more trustful of, black doctors. He decided after his trip that he’d start a temporary practice in Mississippi, and he rented an apartment deep in the Delta.</p><p>三角洲是密西西比州最贫穷的地区，健康状况最差。法科雷德花了数年时间研究健康差异：非裔美国人比白人更早患上慢性病十年；他们死于糖尿病的可能性是常人的两倍；他们平均少活三年。在三角洲，法科雷德可以治疗长得像他的病人；他在全州只能找到另外一位黑人心脏病介入医生。越来越多的证据表明，整个医疗系统中的种族偏见对非裔美国人来说意味着更糟糕的结果。他知道这项研究——黑人患者对黑人医生更敏感，也更信任他们。旅行结束后，他决定在密西西比州临时开业，并在三角洲深处租了一套公寓。</p><p> He fantasized about building a cardiovascular institute and recruiting a multidisciplinary team, from electrophysiologists to podiatrists. But as he researched what it would take, he found a major barrier. Medical specialists with student debt, who graduate owing a median of $200,000, generally could not benefit from federal loan forgiveness programs unless they got jobs at nonprofit or public facilities. Only a few types of private practice providers — primary care, dentists, psychiatrists — qualified for national loan forgiveness. The Delta needed many other physicians. Though Bolivar County was at the center of a diabetes epidemic, there wasn’t a single diabetes specialist, an endocrinologist, within 100 miles.</p><p>他幻想着建立一个心血管研究所，并招募一个多学科团队，从电生理学家到足病学家。但当他研究这需要什么时，他发现了一个主要障碍。有学生债务的医学专家毕业时平均欠20万美元，除非他们在非营利或公共设施找到工作，否则通常无法从联邦贷款减免计划中受益。只有少数类型的私人执业提供者——初级保健、牙医、精神病医生——有资格获得国家贷款减免。三角洲需要许多其他医生。尽管玻利瓦尔县是糖尿病疫情的中心，但在100英里以内没有一位糖尿病专家，一位内分泌学家。</p><p>    Fakorede leased a windowless space in the Cleveland Medical Mall, a former shopping center that had been converted to doctors’ offices. People came to him with heart complaints, but he also asked them to remove their socks. Their legs alarmed him. Their toes were black and their pulses weak. Their calves were cold and hairless. Some had wounds but didn’t know it; diabetes had numbed their feet. Many had been misdiagnosed with arthritis or gout, but when Fakorede tested them, he found peripheral artery disease, in which clogged arteries in the legs limit the flow of blood.</p><p>法科雷德在克利夫兰医疗中心租了一个没有窗户的空间，这是一个以前的购物中心，后来被改建为医生办公室。人们带着心脏病来找他，但他也要求他们脱掉袜子。他们的腿吓了他一跳。他们的脚趾是黑色的，脉搏微弱。他们的小腿冰冷无毛。有些人有伤口，但并不知道；糖尿病使他们的脚麻木。许多人被误诊为关节炎或痛风，但当法科雷德对他们进行检测时，他发现了外周动脉疾病，即腿部动脉阻塞限制血液流动。</p><p> This is what uncontrolled diabetes does to your body: Without enough insulin, or when your cells can’t use it properly, sugar courses through your bloodstream. Plaque builds up faster in your vessels’ walls, slowing the blood moving to your eyes and ankles and toes. Blindness can follow, or dead tissue. Many can’t feel the pain of blood-starved limbs; the condition destroys nerves. If arteries close in the neck, it can cause a stroke. If they close in the heart, a heart attack. And if they close in the legs, gangrene.</p><p>这就是不受控制的糖尿病对你身体的影响：如果没有足够的胰岛素，或者当你的细胞不能正常使用胰岛素时，糖就会通过你的血液循环。斑块在血管壁中积聚得更快，减缓血液流向眼睛、脚踝和脚趾的速度。失明可能会随之而来，也可能是死亡组织。许多人感觉不到缺血肢体的疼痛；这种情况会破坏神经。如果颈部动脉闭塞，可能会导致中风。如果它们靠近心脏，心脏病就会发作。如果它们在腿部闭合，就会导致坏疽。</p><p> Within a month, Bolivar Medical Center had credentialed Fakorede, allowing him to consult on cases and do procedures in the hospital. His most complicated patients came in through the emergency room. Some arrived without any inkling that they had gangrene. One had maggots burrowing in sores. Another showed up after noticing his dog eating the dead flesh off the tips of his toes. Fakorede took a photo to add to his collection. “It was a public health crisis,” he told me. “And no one was talking about amputations and the fact that what was happening was criminal.”</p><p>不到一个月，玻利瓦尔医疗中心就给法科雷德颁发了资格证书，允许他在医院咨询病例和进行手术。他最复杂的病人是通过急诊室来的。有些人抵达时丝毫没有察觉到他们患了坏疽。其中一个有蛆在疮中钻洞。另一个在注意到他的狗吃了他脚趾尖上的死肉后出现了。法科雷德拍了一张照片来增加他的收藏。“这是一场公共卫生危机，”他告诉我。“没有人谈论截肢和正在发生的事情是犯罪的事实。”</p><p> On weekends, Fakorede had been driving back to his five-bedroom home in Tennessee, but in August of 2015, he decided to go all-in on Bolivar County. He sold his house and black Mercedes G-Wagon, and applied for funding to build a practice in the Delta: Cardiovascular Solutions of Central Mississippi. He pitched himself as a heart guy and a plumber, removing buildup in the arteries. Four banks denied him loans, so he borrowed money from friends. He gave himself a two-year window to reduce amputations and publish his outcomes.</p><p>周末，法科雷德开车回他在田纳西州的五居室住宅，但在2015年8月，他决定全力攻打玻利瓦尔县。他卖掉了自己的房子和黑色梅赛德斯G型货车，并申请资金在密西西比州中部的三角洲地区建立一个机构：心血管解决方案。他把自己塑造成一名心脏病专家和水管工，负责清除动脉中的积存物。四家银行拒绝向他贷款，所以他向朋友借钱。他给了自己两年的时间来减少截肢并公布结果。</p><p>     The Delta flood plain runs 7,000 square miles along the northwestern edge of the state, with sweet-smelling, clay-like soil cordoned between bluffs and the banks of the Mississippi River. By the 19th century, the primeval forests had been transformed into a cotton empire; at the start of the Civil War, more than 80% of people in many Delta counties were enslaved. Sharecropping emerged after emancipation, and black farmers cultivated small plots in return for a portion of their crop. They lived on credit — for food and feed and clothing — until the harvest, but even then, their earnings rarely covered their expenses.</p><p>三角洲洪泛平原沿着该州西北边缘绵延7000平方英里，在断崖和密西西比河两岸之间有着芳香的粘土状土壤。到了19世纪，原始森林已经变成了一个棉花帝国；内战开始时，许多三角洲县80%以上的人被奴役。解放后出现了佃农制，黑人农民耕种小块土地以换取一部分作物。在收获前，他们依靠信贷生活——食物、饲料和衣物——但即使在那时，他们的收入也很少能支付他们的开支。</p><p> For decades, African Americans in the South struggled to find and afford health care. The American Medical Association excluded black doctors, as did its constituent societies. Some hospitals admitted black patients through back doors and housed them in hot, crowded basements. Many required them to bring their own sheets and spoons, or even nurses. Before federal law mandated emergency services for all, hospitals regularly turned away African Americans, some in their final moments of life.</p><p>几十年来，南部的非裔美国人一直在努力寻找并支付医疗费用。美国医学协会排除了黑人医生，其成员协会也排除了黑人医生。一些医院通过后门接收黑人患者，并将他们安置在炎热拥挤的地下室。许多人要求他们自带床单和汤匙，甚至护士。在联邦法律规定为所有人提供紧急服务之前，医院经常拒绝非裔美国人，有些人在生命的最后时刻。</p><p> Fakorede was drawn to Bolivar County, in part, because of its history. He’d run out of gas there when he was first scouting the region, and later that evening, he’d Googled its background. For a brief moment, Bolivar was the center of a movement for public health care, driven by the conviction that racial equality was not possible without justice in health. In 1964, when a group of physician activists traveled to the Delta, Robert Smith, a black doctor from Jackson, saw rocketing rates of intestinal parasites and maternal death. “I understood for the first time what it truly meant to be black in Mississippi,” he told a magazine. Under President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, a Boston doctor secured funding to open a community health center in Bolivar, which he grew with the help of Smith. Clinicians worked with residents to take on housing, sanitation, exercise and nutrition. Its success spawned a national project of more than a thousand Federally Qualified Health Centers for the underserved. But funding shrank under President Richard Nixon, and the centers’ initiatives were scaled back to basic primary care.</p><p>法科雷德被吸引到玻利瓦尔县，部分是因为它的历史。当他第一次在该地区侦察时，那里的汽油用完了，那天晚上晚些时候，他用谷歌搜索了它的背景。在一个短暂的时刻，玻利瓦尔是一场公共卫生保健运动的中心，这场运动的驱动力是，如果没有卫生方面的公正，种族平等是不可能的。1964年，当一群医生活动人士前往三角洲时，来自杰克逊的黑人医生罗伯特·史密斯（Robert Smith）看到了肠道寄生虫和产妇死亡率的飙升。“我第一次明白了在密西西比州成为黑人的真正含义，”他告诉一家杂志。在林登·B·约翰逊总统的反贫困战争中，一位波士顿医生获得了资金，在玻利瓦尔开设了一家社区卫生中心，他在史密斯的帮助下发展了这家中心。临床医生与居民一起承担住房、卫生、锻炼和营养方面的工作。它的成功催生了一个全国性的项目，为服务不足的人提供了1000多个联邦合格的医疗中心。但在理查德·尼克松总统的领导下，资金减少了，这些中心的计划也缩减到了基本初级保健。</p><p> By the time Fakorede moved to the Delta, in 2015, the state had the nation’s lowest number of physicians per capita. It had not expanded Medicaid to include the working poor. Across the country, 15% of African Americans were still uninsured, compared with 9% of white Americans. That year, Jennifer Smith, a professor at Florida A&amp;M University College of Law, wrote in the National Lawyers Guild Review what Fakorede saw firsthand: “While the roots of unequal and inequitable health care for African Americans date back to the days of slavery, the modern mechanisms of discrimination in health care has shifted from legally sanctioned segregation to inferior or non-existent medical facilities due to market forces.”</p><p>2015年，法科雷德搬到三角洲时，该州的人均医生人数是全国最低的。它没有将医疗补助扩大到包括有工作的穷人。在全国范围内，15%的非裔美国人仍然没有保险，相比之下，美国白人只有9%。那一年，佛罗里达a&amp；M大学法学院，在《全国律师协会评论》中写道，法科雷德亲眼目睹了：“虽然非裔美国人不平等和不公平医疗的根源可以追溯到奴隶制时代，但现代医疗歧视机制已经从法律认可的隔离转变为市场力量导致的劣质或根本不存在的医疗设施。”</p><p> Fakorede understood that to reach patients, he needed referrals, so he met primary care providers at hospitals and clinics. He asked them to screen for vascular disease, measuring blood pressure at the ankle and the arm. Many didn’t have the time; given the shortage of local physicians, some were seeing up to 70 patients a day. Others didn’t know much about peripheral artery disease or why it was important to diagnose. Some were offended by Fakorede’s requests. Michael Montesi, a family doctor, was grateful for the help, but he found it brash for the new doctor in town to start telling the veterans what to do. He recalled thinking, “Where were you the first 12 years of my practice, when I needed a cardiologist, when I needed an OB-GYN, when I needed a surgeon, when I had to do an amputation in the ER, or deliver a baby that was 23 weeks and watch the baby die because there was nobody there that could take care of him?”</p><p>法科雷德明白，要接触病人，他需要转诊，所以他在医院和诊所会见了初级保健提供者。他要求他们筛查血管疾病，测量脚踝和手臂的血压。许多人没有时间；考虑到当地医生的短缺，一些人每天要看多达70名患者。其他人不太了解外周动脉疾病，也不知道为什么诊断很重要。有些人被法科雷德的要求激怒了。家庭医生迈克尔·蒙特西（Michael Montesi）很感激他的帮助，但他发现城里的新医生开始告诉退伍军人该做什么是鲁莽的。他回忆起当时的想法：“我开业的头12年，当我需要一名心脏病专家，当我需要一名妇产科医生，当我需要一名外科医生，当我不得不在急诊室做截肢手术，或者分娩一个23周的婴儿，看着婴儿死去，因为那里没有人能照顾他，你在哪里？”</p><p> The brushoffs disturbed Fakorede, but when he dug deeper, he realized that the doctors weren’t only overwhelmed; they had no guaranteed payment for this vascular screening. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurers cover all primary care screenings that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of preventive care experts. The group, though, had not recommended testing anybody without symptoms, even the people most likely to develop vascular disease — older adults with diabetes, for example, or smokers. (Up to 50% of people who have the disease are believed to be asymptomatic.) As specialists, cardiologists are reimbursed if they screen patients with risk factors. But by the time patients got to Fakorede, the disease was sometimes too far along to treat. Many already had a nonhealing wound, what’s known as “end stage” peripheral artery disease, the last step before an amputation.</p><p>这些拒绝让法科雷德感到不安，但当他深入挖掘时，他意识到医生们不仅不知所措；他们没有为这项血管筛查保证付款。《平价医疗法》规定，保险公司必须覆盖美国预防服务工作组（一个由预防保健专家组成的独立小组）建议的所有初级保健筛查。不过，该研究小组并没有建议对任何没有症状的人进行检测，即使是最有可能患血管疾病的人——例如患有糖尿病的老年人或吸烟者。（据信，高达50%的患者没有症状。）作为专家，如果心脏病专家筛查有风险因素的患者，他们会得到补偿。但当患者到达法科雷德时，这种疾病有时已经太远而无法治疗。许多人已经有了无法愈合的伤口，即所谓的“终末期”外周动脉疾病，这是截肢前的最后一步。</p><p> When Luvenia Stokes came to Fakorede, she had already lost her right leg at the age of 48. Like many Delta residents, she grew up in a food desert, and without money for fresh produce, she’d developed diabetes at a young age. She said that a pedicurist nicked her toe, and the small cut developed an infection. Without good blood flow, it began bubbling with pus. Stokes told Fakorede that no doctor had performed an angiogram to get a good look at the circulation or a revascularization to clean out the arteries. A surgeon removed her second toe. Without cleared vessels, though, the infection spread. Within weeks, a new surgeon removed her leg.</p><p>当卢维尼亚·斯托克斯来到法科雷德时，她已经在48岁时失去了右腿。和许多三角洲居民一样，她在食物沙漠中长大，没有钱购买新鲜农产品，她很小就患上了糖尿病。她说一位足疗师在她的脚趾上留下了划痕，小伤口感染了。没有良好的血液流动，它开始分泌脓液。Stokes告诉Fakorede，没有医生做过血管造影来仔细观察血液循环，也没有医生做过血管重建来清除动脉。外科医生切除了她的第二个脚趾。然而，如果没有清除的血管，感染就会扩散。几周内，一位新外科医生为她切除了腿。</p><p>    Stokes lived in a single-wide trailer with her mother. Her wheelchair could not fit in the doorways, so she inched through sideways with a walker. Because she could hardly exercise, she gained 48 pounds in two years. The amputation hadn’t treated her vascular disease, and a stabbing pain soon engulfed her remaining leg, “like something is clawing down on you,” she said. When she finally made it to Fakorede, she told him that one doctor had prescribed neuropathy medication and another had diagnosed her with arthritis. “I’m not letting them get that other leg,” Fakorede told her. Stokes’ grandmother, Annie, who lives in a nearby trailer, had lost both her legs, above the knee, to diabetes. Her cousin Elmore had lost his right
