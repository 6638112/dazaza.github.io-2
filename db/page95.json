After months of teases, hints of the number 11, and a  giant Windows 11 leak, Microsoft\u2019s new operating system is official. The big focus for Windows 11 is a simplification of the Windows user interface, a new Windows store, and improvements to performance and multitasking.\n Windows 11 includes a new Start menu and updated Start button that are both centered on the taskbar. This UI is very similar to what we first saw in Windows 10X, a project originally planned for dual-screen devices that Microsoft eventually canceled. A lot of the UI work that went into Windows 10X is appearing in Windows 11.\n  The new Start menu drops the Live Tiles that were originally introduced with Windows 8 and opts for more of the typical launcher you\u2019d find in Chrome OS or Android. There are apps, recent documents, and a separate search interface. Much of the centered appearance is clearly influenced by macOS and Chrome OS, and Windows 11 also includes the rounded corners we\u2019ve seen in both Android and iOS.\n Windows chief Panos Panay says \u201cthe team has obsessed over every detail.\u201d Windows 11 will also include updated dark and light modes, that look a lot better than what we\u2019ve seen in Windows today.\n   There\u2019s also something Microsoft is calling snap layouts, which allow you to quickly snap apps into the various modes that Windows 11 supports. This new version of Windows 11 will also remember where your apps are stored, thanks to something called Snap Group layouts.\n It looks like a useful way to support multiple monitors, and ensure that apps always open on the correct screen. That\u2019s particularly helpful if you\u2019re using a laptop hooked up to a monitor, or a traditional desktop machine with multiple displays.\n Performance is also a big focus for Windows 11. Windows updates are 40 percent smaller, and more efficient as they now happen in the background. Hopefully that will mean that Windows 11 doesn\u2019t disturb you in the middle of work.\n   Microsoft is also integrating Microsoft Teams directly into Windows 11, for both consumers and commercial users. Teams is integrated directly into the taskbar, allowing Windows 11 users to call friends, family, or coworkers. It\u2019s clear that this is a big shift away from Skype, which was bundled as part of Windows 10.\n Windows Widgets and touch gestures are also a big part of Windows 11. Widgets is a personalized feed, powered by AI, and builds on the widgets we\u2019ve seen  Microsoft introduce in Windows 10. It slides in from the left-hand side of Windows 11 and you can also make it fullscreen. Built-in widgets include a news feed, weather, and maps.\n Interestingly, these widgets also include one that lets you tip local creators directly from within Windows 11.\n   Microsoft is also improving the gestures you can use on tablets, and the touch targets. Instead of flipping into a tablet mode, Windows 11 simply adapts to allow you to touch the OS easily.\n Coupled with this are improvements to inking and voice typing. With certain pens, Windows 11 will also support haptic feedback here. That could mean we\u2019ll see a lot of new hardware that will support these stylus changes in Windows 11.\n Xbox is a big part of Microsoft, and we also got to hear from Xbox executive Sarah Bond about PC gaming with Windows 11. Auto HDR, a feature in Xbox Series X / S, will be part of Windows 11. Enabling Auto HDR will add high dynamic range (HDR) to a large number of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games, as long as you have a compatible HDR monitor.\n   Microsoft is also promising speed and performance improvements for Windows 11. DirectStorage will be part of Windows 11, a big new feature from Xbox Series X / S. DirectStorage will require the latest NVMe drives to speed up game load times on Windows 11, and game developers will need to enable this technology to boost load times further.\n Xbox Game Pass is also being integrated into Windows 11, thanks to a new Xbox app that the company has been testing for months. This also includes xCloud integrated into this Xbox app, so you can stream games from Microsoft\u2019s cloud, too.\n   Finally, one of the biggest parts of Windows 11 is the new store. It\u2019s redesigned and will support a whole host of apps that haven\u2019t typically been available in the Windows app store. That includes apps from Adobe Creative Suite, and Android apps including TikTok and Instagram.\n Developers can use their own \u201ccommerce engines\u201d and Microsoft won\u2019t take a cut; devs can even use their own payment systems if they want to. \u201cWindows has always stood for sovereignty for creators,\u201d said Satya Nadella.\n Developing\u2026 we\u2019re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our   Windows 11 live blog  to get the news even faster.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:10:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8bbe\u8ba1,windows,microsoft,\u5ba3\u5e03,announces", "title": "Microsoft\u5ba3\u5e03\u63a8\u51faWindows 11\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u7b49 ", "title_en": "Microsoft announces Windows 11, with a new design, Start menu, and more", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bbe\u8ba1", "windows", "microsoft", "\u5ba3\u5e03", "announces"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "05408419fcc8573b537ad7b1db046d9a.png", "infoid": 1068022, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nCovid-19\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u57fa\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea\u9f3b\u54bd\u62ed\u5b50\u7684\u6837\u54c1\u7684RT-PCR\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSARS-COV-2\u6297\u4f53\u9633\u6027\u9633\u6027\u83cc\u7684\u8840\u6e05\u5b66\u8bc1\u636e26.\u611f\u67d3\u540e2\u4e2a\u6708\u6536\u96c6\u8840\u6e05\u6837\u54c1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6297SARS-COV-2\u6297\u4f53\u6ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u50a8\u5b58\u5728-80\u00b0C\u76f4\u5230\u5206\u6790\u3002\u572856\u2103\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u4e4b\u524d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65ELISA\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4bSARS-COV-2\u7279\u5f02\u6027IgG\u6297\u4f53\uff08South Biotech\uff0cCat\u3002No.2040-05\uff09\uff0c\u572856\u2103\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u70ed\u706d\u6d3b\u3002\u5bf9\u53d7\u4f53\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u57df\uff08RBD\uff09\uff08\u7b5b\u90091\uff1a100\u7a00\u91ca\uff09\u548c\u5c16\u5cf0\u86cb\u767d\uff08\u57285\u500d\u7a00\u91ca\u4e2d\u76841\uff1a100\u786e\u8ba4\uff09\u3002\u5c06\u7ec8\u70b9\u6ef4\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8840\u6e05\u7a00\u91ca\u7684\u5f80\u590d\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u524d\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8840\u6e05\u6837\u54c1\uff08n = 128\uff0926\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u4e0a\u65b9\u76843\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5149\u5bc6\u5ea6\u503c\u3002\u7528\u6297\u6297\u4f53\u6297\u4f53\u7684\u8840\u6e05\u4f7f\u7528\u5982\u524d\u6240\u8ff0\u7684\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u7ea7\u522b3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u5730\u9694\u79bbHCOV-19 /\u632a\u5a01/\u5351\u5c14\u6839-01 / 2020\u542b100\u4e2aTCID 50\u75c5\u6bd2\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e0e\u5154\u5355\u514b\u9686IgG\u5b75\u80b2SARS-COV2 NP\uff08SARS-COV2 NP\uff08SINI\u751f\u7269\uff0c\u732b\u300240143-R019-100\uff09\u548c\u751f\u7269\u7d20\u5316\u7684\u5c71\u7f8a\u6297\u5154IgG\uff08H + L\uff09\uff08\u5357\u90e8Biotech\uff0c\u732b\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u30024050-08\uff09\u548c\u5916\u52a0\u5de5\u7d20 - \u8fc7\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u9176\uff08Sigma-Aldrich\uff0cCat\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u3002E2886\uff09\u3002\u5fae\u751f\u529b\u817a\u5316\u6297\u4f53\u6ef4\u5ea6\u662f\u8840\u6e05\u7a00\u91ca\u7684\u5012\u6570\uff0c\u5f97\u523050\uff05\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2\u611f\u67d3\u6027\u6291\u5236\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u7167\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u8d1f\u9762\u8840\u6e05\u5b66\u57286\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u5f97\u5230\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\n  \u4f7f\u7528Redcap\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6848\u4f8b\u62a5\u544a\u8868\u683c\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7814\u7a76\u7535\u5b50\u6570\u636e\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u8303\u5fb7\u6bd4\u5c14\u7279\u5927\u5b66\uff09\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5206\u6790\u90fd\u5728R\u7248\u672c4.0.3\uff08www.r-project.org\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GGPLOT\u548cGRIDEXTRA\u5c01\u88c5\u5728R\u4e2d\u751f\u4ea7\u56fe\u3002\u60a3\u8005\n...... ", "note_en": "Long-term complications after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are common in hospitalized patients, but the spectrum of symptoms in milder cases needs further investigation. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a prospective cohort study of 312 patients\u2014247 home-isolated and 65 hospitalized\u2014comprising 82% of total cases in Bergen during the first pandemic wave in Norway. At 6 months, 61% (189/312) of all patients had persistent symptoms, which were independently associated with severity of initial illness, increased convalescent antibody titers and pre-existing chronic lung disease. We found that 52% (32/61) of home-isolated young adults, aged 16\u201330 years, had symptoms at 6 months, including loss of taste and/or smell (28%, 17/61), fatigue (21%, 13/61), dyspnea (13%, 8/61), impaired concentration (13%, 8/61) and memory problems (11%, 7/61). Our findings that young, home-isolated adults with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms highlight the importance of infection control measures, such as vaccination.\n     The respiratory tract is the site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry and infection; however, COVID-19 is a complex systemic disease, affecting the cardiovascular, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems  1. As evidence emerges of predominantly lasting impairment of lung function related to fibrosis, more data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 on other organs are required  2. A plethora of symptoms persist in patients surviving severe COVID-19 (refs.   3, 4), and a long COVID syndrome has been proposed  5, 6. However, the severity and duration of symptoms remain largely unknown. Chronic fatigue occurred after SARS infection in 2003 (ref.   7), and it is well known in the aftermath of a spectrum of infectious diseases  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patient management in intensive care was frequently associated with mental and physical decline, and this could partially explain long COVID in patients with severe illness  14. However, the burden of long COVID in mild to moderately ill patients is not well defined. We assessed persistent symptoms 6 months after initial COVID-19 in a prospective cohort of hospitalized and home-isolated patients from the first pandemic wave in Bergen, Norway.\n All patients diagnosed at the only centralized testing facility in the city of Bergen were invited to participate, as well as all patients admitted to the city\u2019s two hospitals: Haukeland University Hospital and Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital. Recruitment commenced with the first diagnosed home-isolated and the first hospitalized patients; 92% of patients during the first pandemic wave agreed to participate. The objective was to identify factors and biomarkers associated with long-term complications. From 28 February to 4 April 2020, we consecutively recruited 357 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We collected demographic and clinical data as well as blood samples. Household members of patients who tested positive were included to ensure completeness of the cohort, and their infection was diagnosed by SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies at 2 months  15. At 6-month follow-up, the study population available for analysis comprised 312 patients, of whom 247 were home-isolated and 65 were hospitalized (Fig.  1).\n Number of participants eligible for inclusion at baseline, blood sampling at 2 months and assessment and fatigue evaluation at 6 months. BMEC, Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic; LTF, lost to follow-up.\n The median age of the study population was 46 years (interquartile range (IQR) 30\u201358 years) with 51% (160/312) women. Forty-four percent had comorbidities (137/312), the most frequent being chronic lung disease (12%, 38/312, 34 with asthma), hypertension (11%, 35/312), chronic heart disease (7%, 22/312), rheumatic diseases (6%, 20/312), diabetes (4%, 13/312) and immunosuppressive conditions (4%, 11/312). In 272 patients who recorded symptoms during acute disease, fatigue (90%, 244/272), cough (71%), headache (64%), myalgia (58%) and dyspnea (55%) were the most frequent, whereas only 21% had fever. Hospitalized patients were older than home-isolated patients, had higher body mass index (BMI) and had more comorbidities, including chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease, hypertension and diabetes (Table  1).\n  Sixty-one percent (189/312) of the total patient population had persistent symptoms 6 months after initial COVID-19 illness, with the most common symptoms being fatigue (37%), difficulty concentrating (26%), disturbed smell and/or taste (25%), memory problems (24%) and dyspnea (21%). Whereas the frequency of most symptoms increased with age in the study population, disturbed smell and/or taste was more frequent in people younger than 46 years old (Table  2). Thirty-nine percent of the study population, commonly children and young adults, had no symptoms at 6 months. Even among the 247 home-isolated patients, 55% (136/247) experienced persistent symptoms at 6 months, most commonly fatigue (30%), disturbed taste and/or smell (27%), concentration impairment (19%), memory loss (18%) and dyspnea (15%) (Table  2).\n  The youngest age group (0\u201315 years) rarely suffered persistent symptoms (13%, 2/16), whereas 52% (32/61) of young adults aged 16\u201330 years who were home-isolated for mild to moderate initial illness had persistent symptoms, the most common being disturbed taste and/or smell (28%), fatigue (21%), dyspnea (13%) and impaired concentration (13%) and memory (11%) (Table  2). In these young adults, comorbidity was not significantly associated with persistent symptoms (33% versus 31%,  P\u2009=\u20091) or fatigue (47% versus 27%,  P\u2009=\u20090.2), although numbers of subjects were low.\n Convalescent antibodies reach a plateau approximately 1\u20132 months after infection, providing a general marker for the magnitude of the immune response  16. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific IgG and microneutralizing antibody titers detected after 2 months were significantly higher in hospitalized patients than home-isolated patients ( P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001; Extended Data Fig.  1). Increased antibody titers at 2 months were associated with the severity of initial illness, older age and higher BMI in multivariable analysis (Table  3 and Fig.  2; severity score adapted from Beigel et al.  17).\n  The relationship of severity of initial COVID-19 illness and of age with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike ( a and  b) and microneutralizing antibody titers ( e and  f) at 2 months. The relationship of antibody titers at 2 months with number of persistent symptoms ( c and  g) and total fatigue score according to the Chalder scale ( d and  h) at 6-month follow-up. The 13 symptoms used are listed in Table  2. The severity of illness was as follows: 1\u2014asymptomatic ( n\u2009=\u20095); 2\u2014home-isolated with symptoms ( n\u2009=\u2009242); 3\u2014hospitalized without medical needs ( n\u2009=\u20090); 4\u2014hospitalized with medical needs ( n\u2009=\u200931); 5\u2014hospitalized needing O 2 ( n\u2009=\u200924); 6\u2014hospitalized needing non-invasive ventilation ( n\u2009=\u20094); and 7\u2014hospitalized needing respirator ( n\u2009=\u20096). The cohort was divided into 15-year age groups: 0\u201315 ( n\u2009=\u200916), 16\u201330 ( n\u2009=\u200965), 31\u201345 ( n\u2009=\u200969), 46\u201360 ( n\u2009=\u200990) and &gt;60 ( n\u2009=\u200972).  a,  b,  e and  f show median spike IgG and microneutralizing antibody titers (horizontal line), 25% and 75% quantiles (box), plus 95% confidence intervals (lines) with outliers (dots).  c and  d are violin plots of number of symptoms (up to 13) or fatigue score (values 0\u201333) divided into four categories of spike IgG: &lt;150 ( n\u2009=\u200921), 150\u20134999 ( n\u2009=\u200996), 5,000\u201320,000 ( n\u2009=\u2009103) and &gt;20,000 ( n\u2009=\u200992). 5k,\u20095,000; 20k, 20,000.  g and  h are violin plots of four categories of microneutralizing titers: &lt;20 (neg  n\u2009=\u200942), 20\u201379 ( n\u2009=\u2009107), 80\u2013320 ( n\u2009=\u200992) and &gt;320 ( n\u2009=\u200971). O 2, supplemental oxygen.\n Increased antibody titers as well as pre-existing lung disease were independently associated with both persistent fatigue and total number of symptoms at 6 months in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Fig.  2c,d,g,h). Severity of initial illness was associated with persistent fatigue and weakly associated with total number of symptoms (Table  4).\n  Post-viral fatigue has been reported afer SARS infection  7 and other viral infections  11, 12, 13. To assess fatigue, we used the Chalder fatigue score, which is validated for adults  18, 19. Fatigue is defined as a total bimodal score of 4 or higher on 11 questions. Thirty percent (69/231) of home-isolated patients, 16 years of age or older, had fatigue at 6 months compared to 63% (39/62) of hospitalized patients. Severe fatigue at 6 months, defined as bimodal score \u22654 + total ordinal score \u226523, was present in 7% (17/231) of home-isolated and 24% (15/62) of hospitalized patients (Supplementary Table  1). In home-isolated patients, the most frequent symptoms of physical fatigue (questions 1\u20137) were tiredness (35%, 81/231), increased need for rest (30%) and lack of energy (29%); the most common symptoms of mental fatigue (questions 8\u201311) were difficulties finding words (23%), difficulties concentrating (19%) and memory problems (18%) (Supplementary Table  1).\n In patients 16 years of age or older, fever during acute illness, severity of initial illness and female gender were associated with fatigue at 6 months in binomial logistic regression (Supplementary Table  2). In addition to female gender, pre-existing lung disease, severity of acute illness and increased convalescent antibody titers were independently associated with increasing fatigue score at 6 months in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Fig.  2d,h).\n Despite the correlation between severity of initial disease and antibody titers at 2 months, both factors were independently associated with features of long COVID in multivariable analysis (Table  4 and Supplementary Table  2). In stratified analysis of 242 home-isolated patients with low to moderate symptoms, increased antibody titers remained associated with number of symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, confidence interval (CI) 1.23\u20131.96) and fatigue score (OR = 1.07, CI 1.02\u20131.12), although the association was not statistically significant for fatigue as a dichotomous variable (OR = 1.48, CI 0.98\u20132.31).\n Our study is novel in assessing long COVID symptoms, not only in hospitalized patients but also in young patients and home-isolated patients with milder disease. A strength is a near-complete, geographically defined cohort of both antibody- and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive patients from the first pandemic wave, including all severities of disease, in an immunologically naive population. The small subgroups are a limitation of this study, and our findings should be confirmed in larger cohorts.\n We found that a large proportion of survivors of COVID-19 in our cohort had persistent symptoms 6 months after their initial illness. Although it has previously been reported that patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 frequently suffer long-term symptoms  20, 21, 22, 23, we found that more than half of home-isolated, mildly to moderately ill patients with COVID-19 still suffered symptoms 6 months after infection. It is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16\u201330 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection. Particularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress.\n The high prevalence of persistent fatigue in patients with COVID-19 is striking and appears higher than observed after common infections, such as influenza, Epstein\u2013Barr virus mononucleosis and dengue  11, 12, 13. Data from Norway have previously shown slightly lower chronic fatigue prevalence (11%) in the general population  24 than in the present household controls (14%), who were younger and had fewer comorbidities than infected patients but were sampled at the same time. However, this apparent difference might be a coincidence owing to low numbers. Our finding that women had higher prevalence of fatigue concurs with results from an earlier study in the general Norwegian population  24. The association between severity of illness and persistent symptoms agrees with data from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (ref.   20). As the respiratory tract is the main target organ for COVID-19, our finding of an association between underlying chronic lung disease (mostly asthma) and persistent symptoms, including fatigue, is not surprising.\n The association between severe initial disease and increased antibody titers at 2 months could be due to higher viral load, which could trigger the immune system more profoundly  25. The finding of increased convalescent antibody titers with increasing age could be explained by more severe disease in older people, as age is a known strong risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, by contrast with the immunosenescence observed after influenza infection in the elderly, multivariable analysis indicated that age and severity of illness were independently associated with increased antibody titers. These findings call for enhanced surveillance of COVID-19 mass vaccination programs. Home-isolated patients aged 16\u201330 years with mild COVID-19 are at risk of long-lasting dyspnea and cognitive symptoms. Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.\n All participants, or their guardians for children younger than 16 years old, provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Western Norway (no. 118664). No compensation was provided to participants beyond reimbursing travel costs to the clinic.\n  As part of a prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up, we consecutively enrolled home-isolated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the period 28 February to 4 April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic in Bergen, Norway. For hospitalized patients, we accepted longer inclusion due to delay in hospitalization, up to 6 May. The study population included SARS-CoV-2 RT\u2013PCR-positive patients diagnosed at Bergen Municipality Emergency Clinic and those admitted to the two neighboring city hospitals: Haukeland University Hospital and Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital. Household contacts of identified patients were invited to participate in the study as secondary cases (seroconverters) or seronegative controls  15. All registered patients with SARS-CoV-2 were invited to participate. The initial rate of participation at inclusion was 92% (278/302); at 2 months, the rate of participation was 88% (336/381, numerator and denominator includes seropositive household members at this time point); and at 6 months, the rate of participation was 82% (312/381). Convalescent serum samples were collected 2 months after infection for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers.\n All testing in Bergen was centralized to the Emergency Clinic and the city\u2019s two hospitals, allowing recruitment of all consenting patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Bergen. In total, 3,319 patients were tested by RT\u2013PCR in the Municipality Emergency Clinic during the period. Of these, 228 tested positive by RT-PCR, and six were excluded because their address was outside of Bergen or because they were admitted to hospital and were categorized as hospitalized. All suspected cases seen at the Municipality Emergency Clinic were examined clinically and diagnosed by medical staff. Patients with moderate disease were sent home for home isolation, or, if considered severe, they were hospitalized. Most of the hospitalized patients were diagnosed upon admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for laboratory confirmation. Patients were telephoned with their results of the RT\u2013PCR test, which was conducted at the reference microbiology laboratory in the tertiary hospital. All confirmed home-isolated patients were contacted by telephone with an invitation to join the study. An additional 79 patients were identified through investigation of seroconversion of household members of RT\u2013PCR-positive patients. Telephone interviews were conducted by medical staff to collect clinical and demographic data. Participants attended the University Clinic at 2 months (6\u20138 weeks) and 6 months (\u00b11 month) for follow-up appointments with medical staff where they were interviewed about long-term symptoms.\n  All consenting patients attended a follow-up clinic and were interviewed by medical staff at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. They provided demographic information; clinical information on symptoms at baseline and 6-month follow-up; and information on potential risk factors, including comorbidities and use of medication. Specific symptoms recorded during acute illness included fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia and headache. Participants were asked if they had any comorbidities and, if so, which specific comorbidities from the following: asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, chronic heart disease, hypertension, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, neuromuscular disease, dementia, rheumatic disease, active cancer, other severe chronic disease and immunosuppressive conditions, including genetic immunodeficiency, HIV, organ transplant, and cytostatic or other immunosuppressive treatment. Data were collected on severity of initial illness\u2014that is, need for hospitalization, symptoms during acute illness and need for non-invasive ventilatory support or respirator treatment  17. Radiological investigations were conducted only on hospitalized patients. At 6-month follow-up, all participants aged 16 years or older were invited to complete a validated fatigue questionnaire containing 11 key questions according to the Chalder fatigue scale  18, 19. Fatigue was defined as a total dichotomized score of 4 or higher. Severe fatigue was defined as fatigue plus a total Chalder score of 23 or higher.\n  Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on RT\u2013PCR on samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and on serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity  26. Serum samples were collected 2 months after infection for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until analyzed. Samples were heat-inactivated for 1 h at 56\u2009\u00b0C before analysis in duplicate by a two-step ELISA for detecting SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies (Southern Biotech, cat. no. 2040-05) to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (screening 1:100 dilution) and the spike protein (confirmation from 1:100 in five-fold dilutions). Endpoint titers were calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving an optical density value of 3 standard deviations above the mean of historical pre-pandemic serum samples ( n\u2009=\u2009128)  26. Sera with antibodies against the RBD were tested in a microneutralization assay using the local isolate hCoV-19/Norway/Bergen-01/2020 (GISAID accession ID EPI_ISL_541970) in a certified Biosafety Level 3 laboratory as previously described  27. Briefly, sera were tested in duplicate in doubling dilutions starting from 1:20 dilution and mixed with 100 TCID 50 viruses, followed by incubation with rabbit monoclonal IgG against SARS-CoV2 NP (Sino Biological, cat. no. 40143-R019-100) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Southern Biotech, cat. no. 4050-08) and extravidin\u2013peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. E2886). The microneutralizing antibody titer is the reciprocal of the serum dilution giving 50% inhibition of virus infectivity. For all control individuals, negative serology was confirmed at 6 months.\n  Data were entered using electronic case report forms in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University). All analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.3 ( www.r-project.org), and graphs were produced in R using the ggplot and gridExtra packages.

But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest  stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is \u201c awash in other shots\u201d already, as the  The New York Times put it.\n Practically speaking, this is true. If the FDA sees no urgency, the Novavax vaccine might not be available in the U.S. for months, and in the meantime the national supply of other doses exceeds demand. But the asymmetry in coverage also hints at how the hype around the early-bird vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna has distorted perception. Their rapid arrival has been described in this magazine as \u201c the triumph of mRNA\u201d\u2014a brand-new vaccine technology whose \u201cpotential stretches far beyond this pandemic.\u201d Other outlets gushed about \u201c a turning point in the long history of vaccines,\u201d one that \u201c changed biotech forever.\u201d It was easy to assume, based on all this reporting, that mRNA vaccines had already proved to be the most effective ones you could get\u2014that they were better, sleeker, even   cooler than any other vaccines could ever be.\n But the fascination with the newest, shiniest options obscured some basic facts. These two particular mRNA vaccines may have been the first to get results from Phase 3 clinical trials, but that\u2019s because of superior trial management, not secret vaccine sauce. For now, they are harder and more expensive to manufacture and distribute than traditional types of vaccines, and their side effects are more common and more severe. The latest Novavax data confirm that it\u2019s possible to achieve the same efficacy against COVID-19 with a more familiar technology that more people may be inclined to trust. (The mRNA vaccines delivered efficacy rates of  95 and  94 percent against the original coronavirus strain in Phase 3 trials, as compared with  96 percent for Novavax in its first trial, and now 90 percent against a mixture of variants.\n  Pandemic-vaccine success, as I  wrote last year, was never just about the technology. You needed a good vaccine, sure\u2014but to get it out the door quickly, you also had to have a massive clinical-trial operation going, and it had to be situated in places where the virus would be spreading widely at just the right time. Even if your candidate worked amazingly well, if you weren\u2019t testing it in the middle of a huge outbreak, you\u2019d have to wait a very long time for the evidence to build.\n The precise timing of these studies mattered a great deal in practice. The Phase 3 clinical trials for Pfizer and Moderna, for example, were up and running in the U.S. by late summer 2020, and so they caught the nation\u2019s giant wave of infections in the fall. By the time Novavax had finished recruiting in the U.S. and Mexico,  in February, case rates had been dropping precipitously. This fact alone, independent of any aspect of vaccine technology, did a lot to shape the outcome.\n Corporate strategy was another crucial factor. To \u201cwin\u201d the vaccine race, a company would need to be able to produce high-quality vaccine doses reliably and quickly, and in vast numbers. It would also need to field the challenges of working with multiple regulatory agencies around the world. And it would need to do all of this  at the same time.\n BioNTech, the German company that developed the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, could not have accomplished so much, so quickly by itself. Last October, the company\u2019s CEO, U\u011fur \u015eahin,  told German interviewers that BioNTech had sought out Pfizer for help because of the scale of the clinical-trial program necessary for drug approvals. That strategic partnership, and not simply the \u201ctriumph of mRNA,\u201d was what propelled them past the post. (Moderna had the advantage of its partnership with the National Institutes of Health.) Consider this: The BioNTech-Pfizer first-in-human vaccine study appeared on the U.S. government\u2019s registry of clinical trials on  April 30, 2020\u2014the  same day as the first-in-human vaccine study for Novavax, which would be going it alone. In a parallel universe where Novavax had paired up with, say, Merck, this story could have come out very differently.\n In the meantime, the early success of two mRNA vaccines pulled attention away from the slower progress of other candidates based on the same technology. Just two days after last week\u2019s Novavax announcement came the news that an mRNA vaccine developed by the German company CureVac had delivered a  weak early efficacy rate in a Phase 3 trial, landing below even the 50 percent minimum level set by the World Health Organization and the FDA. \u201c The results caught scientists by surprise,\u201d  The New York Times reported. CureVac is the company that President Donald Trump  reportedly tried to lure to the U.S. early in the pandemic, and the one that Elon Musk  said he would supply with automated \u201cRNA microfactories\u201d for vaccine production. In the end, none of this mattered. CureVac\u2019s mRNA vaccine just doesn\u2019t seem to be good enough.\n The \u201c sobering\u201d struggles of CureVac perfectly illustrate what epidemiologists call \u201csurvivor bias\u201d\u2014a tendency to look only at positive examples and draw sweeping conclusions on their basis. When the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines triumphed,  The  Washington Post suggested that a bet on \u201c speedy but risky\u201d mRNA technology had paid off with a paradigm-shifting breakthrough. Anthony Fauci called the gamble \u201c a spectacular success.\u201d Such analyses usually had less to say about the non-mRNA vaccines that had gotten into clinical trials just as quickly\u2014and about the other mRNA vaccines that were hitting snags along the way.\n Now we\u2019ve seen what happened to CureVac, and that  some mRNA formulations clearly work much better than others.  By one count, nine groups were testing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in animal studies as of May 2020, and six were expected to be in clinical trials a few months later. By the end of the year, only BioNTech-Pfizer, Moderna, and CureVac had reached Phase 3 testing,  compared with 13 non-mRNA vaccines. Of the nine mRNA-vaccine candidates that were already testing in animals in mid-2020, just two have proved efficacy at this point, while no fewer than  nine vaccines based on more traditional technologies have reached the same mark.\n These other, non-mRNA vaccines have been widely used throughout the world\u2014and some could still make an important difference in the U.S. Although the U.S. has plenty of doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines available right now, demand for them has cratered.  The Washington Post  reports that in 10 states, fewer than 35 percent of American adults have been vaccinated. An international study of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, published in May, found that among the most common online rumors were those alleging particular dangers of mRNA technology\u2014that it leads, for example, to the creation of \u201c genetically modified human beings.\u201d The CDC has also made a point of  debunking the circulating falsehood that COVID-19 vaccines can change your DNA. For a time, it looked as though the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine would help address this worry. It\u2019s based on a fairly new technology, but not as new as mRNA. However, concerns about  tainted doses made at a Baltimore factory and the emergence of a  very rare but serious side effect have pretty much dashed that hope. The Johnson &amp; Johnson single-dose vaccine has reportedly accounted for  fewer than 4 percent of doses administered in the country.\n  In this context, the success of the Novavax vaccine should be A1 news. The recent results confirm that it has roughly the same efficacy as the two authorized mRNA vaccines, with the added benefit of being based on an older, more familiar science. The protein-subunit approach used by Novavax was first implemented for the hepatitis B vaccine, which has been used in the U.S.  since 1986. The pertussis vaccine, which is required for almost all children in U.S. public schools, is also made this way. Some of those people who have been wary of getting the mRNA vaccines may find Novavax more appealing.\n The Novavax vaccine also has a substantially lower rate of side effects than the authorized mRNA vaccines.  Last week\u2019s data showed that about 40 percent of people who receive Novavax report fatigue after the second dose, as compared with 65 percent  for Moderna and more than 55 percent  for Pfizer. Based on the results of Novavax\u2019s  first efficacy trial in the U.K., side effects (including but not limited to fatigue) aren\u2019t just less frequent; they\u2019re milder too. That\u2019s a very big deal for people on hourly wages, who already bear a disproportionate risk of getting COVID-19, and who have been less likely to get vaccinated in part because of the risk of losing days of work to post-vaccine fever, pain, or malaise. Side effects are a big barrier for COVID-vaccine acceptance. The  CDC reported on Monday that, according to a survey conducted in the spring, only about half of adults under the age of 40 have gotten the vaccine or definitely intend to do so, and that, among the rest, 56 percent say they are concerned about side effects. Lower rates of adverse events are likely to be a bigger issue still for parents, when considering vaccination for their children.\n Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been extraordinary lifesavers in this pandemic, and we may well be heading into a new golden age of vaccine development. (This week, BioNTech started injections in an  early trial for an mRNA vaccine for melanoma.)

Why not put more capital into a startup cohort that was recently immensely lucrative?\n But the venture capital group is up to a bit more than just writing new checks. We can tell that much from the firm\u2019s  short post announcing its new fund. Mix in a recent interview with a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen concerning the American regulatory environment, and we can understand that the firm is not simply planning a flurry of new deals.\n  The headline figure of $2.2 billion in capital available for crypto projects is driving headlines this morning, but the dollar figure should not be a surprise. There\u2019s essentially infinite money in the market for name-brand venture capital firms today, it appears, and with a16z\u2019s recent Coinbase win, I doubt it was monstrously difficult for the

", "note_en": "This round, a Series B, is led by ICONIQ Growth (the growth round investment arm of the storied ICONIQ, backed by a number of high profile family offices including that of Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg). Lead Edge Capital, Threshold Ventures, Heavybit, and Alliance Venture are also in this round, some of which also participated in Sanity\u2019s previous  $9.3 million fundraise in October 2020.\n This latest investment brings the total raised by Sanity to $51.8 million. It is not disclosing its valuation, but Magnus Hillestad, Sanity\u2019s CEO and co-founder, said the company was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the number. In any case, it comes on the back of some very strong growth. Sanity is now being used by almost 100,000 developers, marketers, content creators and product professionals, the company said, with \u201cactive users\u201d numbering at 30,000 (double the number of active users the company had in October, he said). Customers include the likes of National Geographic, Puma, InVision, Datastax and Brex \u2014 who are using it to manage their content repositories and letting them flexibly use information across a range of endpoints.\n  \u201cHeadless\u201d has become a big theme in the world of technology, covering services as varied as content (by way of content management systems, commerce, banking and financial services. Organizations that want to buy systems to, say, build websites without putting a lot of investment into design can use platforms that both help them manage the content of the sites, as well as the look of them. But some might want a more customized experience, and they will opt for headless offerings, where there are systems still built to help automate and manage data at the backend, but giving them the ability to design front ends that are tailored to their specific needs.\n In Hillestad\u2019s view, the rise of headless services has been an important development, but what Sanity has conceived of is the next step in extensibility: a platform that lets you use content on the fly in a number of ways without people having to work on that in separate systems.\n \u201cWe are taking a programmatic approach to content,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat businesses need now are not just marketing, or product, or e-commerce experiences.\u201d These are all converging, he believes, \u201cSo you need to be able to build experiences to catch people wherever they are.\n \u201cData is content, but content is also data. If you think about what we are doing, what we are giving companies is a content lake,\u201d he continued. \u201cLike data lakes, a content lake is structured, yet schema-less.\u201d\n This in turn gives companies the ability to use it across a number of use cases. This is notable because typically content is stored in silos created for specific purposes, part of the limitation of how CMS systems, even typical headless CMS systems, are conceived and built.\n For now, there are however also limitations in Sanity: the company has yet to come up with interesting ways to enable translations between, say, audio and printed content, although that would appear to be a logical step for the company to take as it grows, given how many consumers already switch between different kinds of media formats.\n \u201cIn an era of digital globalization, companies must rapidly deliver complex, multi-channel, and engaging digital experiences to reach customers wherever they are. This is forcing them to rethink the CMS. At the same time, developers are increasingly leading the adoption of new technologies and holding the keys to adapt effectively to this shift,\u201d said Doug Pepper, general partner at ICONIQ Growth, who is joining the board with this round. \u201cSanity has created the hero product for building innovative product experiences, with an impressive developer-oriented approach to content delivery and a personalized product experience that breaks down silos for content creators, marketing and developer teams. We\u2019re excited to support the Sanity team as they enter this next phase of growth.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 23:27:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5185\u5bb9,content", "title": "\u7406\u667a\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u7684\u201c\u4f7f\u7528 - \u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86390\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSanity raises $39M for its \u201cuse-anywhere\u201d approach to content repositories\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/sanity-raises-39m-for-its-use-anywhere-approach-to-content-repositories/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5185\u5bb9", "content"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5fb44189703568ecff32e4a28e9ed2c1.png", "infoid": 1068018, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b62\u5b50\u60f3\u8981\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u8005\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u4f53\u9a8c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u50cf\u7528\u6237\u70b9\u51fb\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u4e00\u8d77\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u8d2d\u7269\u7bee\u5b50\u3002 Spore Ceo Austin Hallock\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u521b\u9020\u8005\u5de8\u5934\u7ade\u4e89\u4e3a\u201c\u751f\u7269\u201d\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u521b\u9020\u8005\u5de8\u5934\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u521b\u9020\u8005\u81ea\u5df1\u7684URL\u7684\u767d\u6807\u5a92\u4f53\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6613\u4e8e\u6253\u9020\u7684\u96c6\u7ebf\u5668\u6709\u7c89\u4e1d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u3002\n \u901a\u8fc7\u5b62\u5b50\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u53d7\u4f17\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u6c9f\u901a\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e76\u4e0d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5141\u8bb8\u7206\u7834\u65b0\u95fb\u901a\u8baf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u64ad\u5ba2\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u5e97\u9762\u6216\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u804a\u5929\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u5176\u7ad9\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u630124/7\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u5c06\u514d\u8d39\u8ba2\u9605\u8005\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u8981\u5efa\u8bbe\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5141\u8bb8\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u5411\u5176\u652f\u4ed8\u98ce\u6247\u53d1\u9001\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n \u5c0f\u578b\u542f\u52a8\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86\u7531SignalFire\u76841\u7f8e\u5143\u9884\u5148\u79cd\u5b50\u5faa\u73af\uff0cjustin Kan\uff06amp\u7684\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u4e0e;

Spore CEO Austin Hallock is looking to compete with other creator giants for the \u201clink in bio\u201d real estate on social media sites with a white-label option that uses a creator\u2019s own URL, selling an easy-to-build hub focused solely on connecting personalities with their fans.\n With Spore, users can manage their audience, communicate with them and analyze what is and isn\u2019t working.\n  The platform allows for blasting out newsletter updates, podcasts or texts while embedding functionality like storefronts or Discord-like chat feeds into their sites to keep the interactions going 24/7. Creators can also use the tool to convert free subscribers to paying ones, managing the payments flow while also building flows to allow creators to send certain content to their paying fans.\n The small startup has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by SignalFire with additional participation from Justin Kan &amp; Robin Chan\u2019s GOAT, Canaan, Lenny Rachitsky, Nathan Baschez, Justin Waldron and Dave Nemetz, among others.\n  It\u2019s the first lead investment for former TechCrunch editor Josh Constine in his role at SignalFire (full disclosure: I used to work closely with Josh). Constine started using Spore to build out a site for his regular show on Clubhouse, fellow investor Justin Kan also grew familiar with the team by building out a website for his podcast and YouTube channel.\n \u201cI chose Spore as my first lead investment as a VC because it solves creators\u2019 biggest problems by giving them their own white-labeled website they control, and combining all the best content, communication, analytics, and payment tools so creators can spend their time making art instead of being web developers,\u201d Constine tells TechCrunch.\n Spore is certainly a small-scale operation at the moment with 4 full-time employees, though they\u2019re hoping to grow their team with this raise. All of these features are in their early MVP stages, but Hallock wants his company to continue building out its utility to creators so that they can build a direct connection with their fans, one that isn\u2019t obfuscated by algorithms..\n \u201cWe definitely want to give creators ownership,\u201d Hallock tells TechCrunch. \u201cToday, you\u2019re promoting your Linktree page or Patreon rather than just promoting your own brand\u2026 We don\u2019t want it to be about Spore.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 23:27:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

cultivate a kind of meta-community that brings people together from across other social media sites.\n  \u201cWe kind of view this as the essence of what the creator economy is all about,\u201d Happs CEO Mark Goldman told TechCrunch. \u201cThe idea of locking creators into an individual platform is a very traditional way of thinking about content creation.\u201d\n  Like Goldman, the other co-founders, David Neuman and Drew Shepard, come from the media world. Goldman was the founding COO of  Current TV, an experimental TV channel that dabbled in user-generated content and eventually sold to Al Jazeera in 2013.\n \u201cThe whole idea was to democratize media and open it up,\u201d Goldman said of his time working on Current TV, which he connects directly to his interest in building Happs. \u201c[We] loved the creativity unleashed by that.\u201d\n Online creators tend to be siloed within the app where they\u2019ve built the biggest community, but Happs wants to empower them to reach as many followers as possible in a platform-agnostic way. For creators, the appeal with multistreaming is maximizing reach while making content efficiently. There\u2019s a risk of alienating YouTube followers at the expense of your Twitch community if you don\u2019t play your cards right, but some savvy content creators have turned toward the model to grow their audiences.\n Happs connects people across platforms in a few ways. For one, Happs users can broadcast live to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Twitch simultaneously. The app also collects live comments from all supported social media sites and beams them into its own interface where they appear in a continuous cross-platform stream.\n The integrated comment feature is nice built-in option for anyone who\u2019s straddled comments across multiple devices simultaneously while livestreaming, which is no easy feat. When you\u2019re streaming live you can feature a comment so that followers can see it on the screen no matter what platform they\u2019re watching on.\n Other companies in the space like  OBS,\u00a0 Streamlabs and  Restream are focused on the tools part of the equation, offering power users a useful backend for pushing out multi-streamed live video.  Streamyard also offers multistreaming to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other platforms through a simple browser interface.\n  Unlike those services, Happs feels more like a social network, with familiar features like user profile photos, follower counts and a feed next to a \u201cgo live\u201d button. Anyone can use the multi-streaming platform through its iOS or Android apps or a web interface, whether they\u2019re a creator signing up for the tools or a fan looking to support the content they love.\n Happs lacks some of its competitors\u2019 bells and whistles, stuff like fancy customized graphics and lower-thirds, but has a few interesting tricks of its own. While streaming live on Happs, you can invite someone else on the app to join your feed for a real-time collaboration. The social networking elements are meant to encourage cross-platform creativity, so a YouTuber and a Twitch personality could hang out together and boost both of their reaches, all while streaming to a bunch of other apps.\n Happs also offers users monetization tools from the get-go, with no requirements before they can start making money. That speaks to the app\u2019s appeal for creators who might be less established or just starting out. Happs could be a much harder sell for a popular creator deeply invested in a platform like Twitch, which has rules against multi-streaming for most accounts that are allowed to monetize.\n There are a few different ways to monetize. One lets anyone on Happs sponsor a broadcaster through regular monthly payments. The other is a one-off option that lets you chip in an award for any livestream, or to the VOD (video on demand) after the fact. The in-app currency is a virtual coin that users can buy or earn through doing stuff on the app. There are no plans for ads (yet, anyway).\n The company will take 30% cut of subscription earnings, though according to Goldman they\u2019ll be waiving those fees for an unspecified period of time to attract people to the platform.\n \u201cWe raised this round to really build up product and tech team [and] to make the platform much more stable and reliable,\u201d Goldman said. The company is looking forward to leveraging the new resources to \u201creally go out now and get in front of creators so they know Happs exists.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 23:27:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e73\u53f0,multicast", "title": "\u5e78\u798f\u4e3a\u591a\u64adLivestream\u5e73\u53f0\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u9ad8470\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHapps raises $4.7 million for a multicast livestream platform creator community\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/happs-multistreaming-platform-creators/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e73\u53f0", "multicast"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fca5a2dde9a572349d2bc3b60c729c9e.jpg", "infoid": 1068016, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Microsoft\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u5047\u671f\u5411\u516c\u4f17\u53d1\u5e03Windows 11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u671f\u5f8511\u6708\u5e95\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u4e00\u540d\u516c\u5171\u8d4c\u6ce8\u3002\n \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8ddf\u968fWindows 10x\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6d88\u4ea1\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u578b\u548c\uff08\u6700\u7ec8\uff09\u5355\u5c4f\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u60a8\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u4e1c\u897f\u4f1a\u611f\u5230\u719f\u6089\uff0c\u4e0b\u964d\u5230\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u4eba\u5411\u4f60\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Windows 11\u548cWindows 10x\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4f60\u5c31\u4f1a\u52aa\u529b\u5730\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002\n   \u968f\u7740Microsoft\u9996\u5e2d\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b98Panos Panos Panay\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4e2d\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u8ba9\u60a8\u89c9\u5f97\u201c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u7684\u5e73\u9759\u611f\u201d\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0cWindows\u56e2\u961f\u4e5f\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u5b83\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5236\u4f5c\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cWindows\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u5feb40\uff05\uff0c\u4f46\u73ed\u7eb3\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u542f\u52a8\u60a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u751a\u81f3\u6d4f\u89c8\u5e94\u8be5\u611f\u89c9\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\n  \u9664\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u89e6\u6478\u5c4f\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u534a\u900f\u660e\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u65b0UI\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u4e00\u662fMicrosoft\u8c03\u7528\u6355\u6349\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u5f53\u60a8\u5c06\u9f20\u6807\u60ac\u505c\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f39\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u60a8\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u5c06\u7a97\u53e3\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u89d2\u843d\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u6d89\u53ca\u5c06\u7a97\u53e3\u62d6\u52a8\u5230\u5c4f\u5e55\u7684\u89d2\u843d\uff08\u5f53\u60a8\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u5c4f\u5e55\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\uff09\u3002\n \u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u662fWindows 11\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u5728\u8c08\u5230\u7403\u961f\u65f6\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u770b\u6da8\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u79d8\u5bc6\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u6700\u8fd1\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7248\u672c\u7684\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u5b83\u5e26\u5230Windows 11\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u662f\u6709\u9053\u7406\u7684\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u4ece\u672a\u5411Windows\u5e26\u6765Skype\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u5f97\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684FaceTime\u56e2\u961f\u3002\n  \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u770b\u5230Windows 11\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u60a8\u77e5\u9053Web Widgets\u662f\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 \u201cWindows\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u9972\u6599\uff0c\u7531AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b56\u5212\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u201dPanay\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5c0f\u90e8\u4ef6\u4e0d\u662f\u65b0\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u74f7\u7816\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c06\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u65b0\u7684\u753b\u5e03\u4ece\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u753b\u5e03\u3002 ", "note_en": "Microsoft plans to release Windows 11 to the general public by the holidays, so we can probably expect it sometime around late November. Before that, we\u2019ll likely see a slew of public betas.\n If you followed along with the development and eventual demise of Windows 10X, Microsoft\u2019s operating system with a simplified user interface for dual- and (eventually) single-screen laptops, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing here will feel familiar, down to the redesigned Start menu. Indeed, if somebody showed you screenshots of Windows 11 and early previews of Windows 10X, you\u2019d have a hard time telling them apart.\n   As Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay noted in today\u2019s announcement, the overall idea behind the design is to make you feel \u201can incredible sense of calm,\u201d but at the same time, the Windows team has also worked to make it a lot faster. Windows Updates, for example, are supposed to be 40 percent faster, but Panay also noted that starting up your machine and even browsing should feel much faster.\n  Besides the new user interface, which makes copious use of translucency and shadows and new features for touch screen users, one of the core new UI features is what Microsoft calls Snap Layouts, which pops up a small widget when you hover over the icon that maximizes your window to allow you to move the window to any corner, something that previously involved dragging your window to the corner of your screen (which was often hard when you used multiple screens).\n Another major new feature is that Windows 11 will come with Teams built-in from the outset. It\u2019s no secret that Microsoft is bullish when it comes to Teams. It recently launched the consumer version of Teams, so it makes sense to now bring it to Windows 11, too. It\u2019s worth noting that Microsoft never brought Skype to Windows, so this is quite a change, but it basically makes Teams Microsoft\u2019s Facetime.\n  If you saw the Windows 11 leaks, you know that web widgets are one of the more visible new features. \u201cWindows widgets is a new, personalized feed, powered by AI, serving you curated content,\u201d Panay said. Widgets aren\u2019t a new thing, of course, and in many ways, they make up for the removal of Live Tiles in the Start Menu. They\u2019ll also give developers a new canvas to surface information from their applications.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 23:26:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

announcing today that it is delaying its plans to phase out third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year or so later than originally planned. Other browsers like Safari and Firefox have already implemented some blocking against third-party tracking cookies, but Chrome is the most-used desktop browser, and so its shift will be more consequential for the ad industry. That\u2019s why the term \u201ccookiepocalypse\u201d has taken hold.\n In the blog post announcing the delay, Google says that decision to phase out cookies over a \u201cthree month period\u201d in mid-2023 is \u201csubject to our engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\u201d In other words, it is pinning part of the delay on  its need to work more closely with regulators to come up with new technologies to replace third-party cookies for use in advertising.\n Few will shed tears for Google, but it has found itself in a very difficult place as the sole company that dominates multiple industries: search, ads, and browsers. The more Google cuts off third-party tracking, the more it harms other advertising companies and potentially increases its own dominance in the ad space. The less Google cuts off tracking, the more likely it is to come under fire for not protecting user privacy. And no matter what it does, it will come under heavy fire from regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, publishers, and anybody else with any kind of stake in the web.\n Finding a way to balance those conflicting incentives has proven difficult to say the least. One reason is that, as a steward of the open web, Google is attempting to develop its new privacy technologies out in the open via the usual process of creating web standards. It has bundled several efforts under the rubric of a \u201c Privacy Sandbox,\u201d a catch-all term for a bunch of different new proposals for Chrome and the web.\n The most contentious of those proposals has been the \u201cFederated Learning of Cohorts\u201d technology, or FLoC. It is a  very complicated attempt to create groups of demographically similar users in a semi-anonymous decentralized system that advertisers could use to target ads. However,  not a single other browser vendor has signaled that it is on board with using FLoC, and several have explicitly said they would block it. The best response Google has really gotten is this  analysis from Mozilla that identifies some problems in a way that doesn\u2019t completely slam the door on future Firefox adoption.\n Google is pointing to a \u201crigorous, multi-phased public development process, including extensive discussion and testing periods\u201d for FLoC and other proposals, a fairly obvious signal that it will end up changing or replacing FLoC. \u201cWe plan to conclude this origin trial in the coming weeks and incorporate input, before advancing to further ecosystem testing,\u201d Google says.\n The company is promising a \u201cmore detailed schedule\u201d will be posted on its  Privacy Sandbox website. But in the meantime, here\u2019s its current schedule \u2014 complete with a note that this revised timeline will need to be approved by regulators:\n After this public development process, and subject to our engagement with the CMA, our plan for Chrome is to phase out support for third party cookies in two stages: Stage 1 (Starting late-2022): Once testing is complete and APIs are launched in Chrome, we will announce the start of stage 1.

The company has been teasing the concept for a couple of years now and  showed it off earlier this year at virtual CES.\n TCL calls it NxtWear G and emphasizes that it\u2019s not a VR or AR device in its current configuration. Instead, it acts as an external display for your mobile device or laptop, with two 1080p Micro OLED panels that give the effect of looking at a 140-inch screen.\n The wearable display works with phones, tablets, and laptops that offer USB-C DisplayPort functionality, including recent MacBooks, iPad Pros, and Samsung S21 series phones. The glasses plug directly into your device, displaying content on a 16:9 screen in front of your eyes. The whole thing, cable included, weighs 130g (4.6oz), and stereo speakers are built into the frames, though TCL recommends using wireless earbuds or a headset.\n  Among other global announcements timed for Mobile World Congress, TCL is announcing a new screen-sharing function for its smartphones called Multi-Screen Collaboration. At launch, it will work only with the TCL 20 Pro 5G and will allow owners of the phone to wirelessly share files, photos, clipboard content, and messages with a compatible Windows 10 laptop or PC.\n Photos and videos can also be shared from the phone to a TCL TV. In this mode, the phone acts as a trackpad so you can move a cursor around the TV screen to select images or clips to play. TCL says the feature will come to the 20 Pro 5G via a software update in the coming months.\n   TCL is also previewing another new wearable \u2014 one for the kids. Movetime Family Watch 2 is a kid-oriented version of its  4G-enabled smartwatch designed for seniors. It features a 1.54-inch screen along with voice and video calling. There\u2019s real-time location tracking and a geofencing feature, an IP65 rated housing, and up to seven days of standby time on its battery.

After months of teases, hints of the number 11, and a  giant Windows 11 leak, Microsoft\u2019s new operating system is official. The big focus for Windows 11 is a simplification of the Windows user interface, a new Windows store, and improvements to performance and multitasking.\n Windows 11 includes a new Start menu and updated Start button that are both centered on the taskbar. This UI is very similar to what we first saw in Windows 10X, a project originally planned for dual-screen devices that Microsoft eventually canceled. A lot of the UI work that went into Windows 10X is appearing in Windows 11.\n   The new Start menu drops the Live Tiles that were originally introduced with Windows 8 and opts for more of the typical launcher you\u2019d find in Chrome OS or Android. There are apps, recent documents, and a separate search interface. Much of the centered appearance is clearly influenced by macOS and Chrome OS, and Windows 11 also includes the rounded corners we\u2019ve seen in both Android and iOS.\n Windows chief Panos Panay says \u201cthe team has obsessed over every detail.\u201d Windows 11 will also include updated dark and light modes, that look a lot better than what we\u2019ve seen in Windows today.\n   There\u2019s also something Microsoft is calling snap layouts, which allow you to quickly snap apps into the various modes that Windows 11 supports. This new version of Windows 11 will also remember where your apps are stored, thanks to something called Snap Group layouts.\n It looks like a useful way to support multiple monitors, and ensure that apps always open on the correct screen. That\u2019s particularly helpful if you\u2019re using a laptop hooked up to a monitor, or a traditional desktop machine with multiple displays.\n Performance is also a big focus for Windows 11. Windows updates are 40 percent smaller, and more efficient as they now happen in the background. Hopefully that will mean that Windows 11 doesn\u2019t disturb you in the middle of work.\n Developing\u2026 we\u2019re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our   Windows 11 live blog  to get the news even faster.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 23:18:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,microsoft,\u7b80\u5316", "title": "Microsoft\u5ba3\u5e03\u63a8\u51faWindows 11\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684UI\uff0c\u65b0\u7684Windows Store\uff0c\u201c\u5f00\u59cb\u201d\u83dc\u5355\u7b49 ", "title_en": "Microsoft announces Windows 11, with a simplified UI, new Windows store, Start menu, and more", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22546791/microsoft-windows-11-announcement-features-updates?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "microsoft", "\u7b80\u5316"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "881932c516f7acdf18a105cff7aa5000.jpg", "infoid": 1068011, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u8fce\u6765\u65b0\u7248Windows\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u676511\u5c06\u662f\u9b54\u6cd5\u53f7\u7801\u3002 \u7ecf\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u8336\u53f6\uff0cWindows 11\u4e0a\u5468\u6cc4\u9732\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u65e9\u671f\u770b\u770b\u5fae\u8f6f\u4eca\u5929\u5e94\u8be5\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002  \u5fae\u8f6f\u56de\u5e94\u4e86\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u201c\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u59cb\u201d\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u5f88\u591a\u65e9\u671f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5efa\u9020\u6240\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u671f\u5f85\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u4e86\u89e3Microsoft\u5bf9Windows Store\u7684\u5927\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6253\u5f00\u66f4\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002  \u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8428\u8fea\u4e9a\u7eb3\u5f97\u5fb7\u62c9\u5df2\u7ecf\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684Windows\u620f\u5f04\u4e3a\u201c\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74Windows\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u201d \u6240\u4ee5\u5b83\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u516c\u544a\u5bf9Windows\u7528\u6237\u6765\u8bf4\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002  \u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u535a\u5ba2\u6240\u6709\u7684\u516c\u544a\u4ee5\u53ca\u6cbf\u9014\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e9b\u60ca\u559c\u3002 \u8c03\u6574\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u89c2\u770b\uff01 ", "note_en": "Microsoft is ready to usher in a new version of Windows, and it looks like 11 will be the magical number.

He lived on tea, coffee, soda water, and vitamins while living at home in  Tayport, Scotland, and frequently visiting  Maryfield Hospital for medical evaluation. He lost 276 pounds (125\u00a0kg) and set a record for the length of a fast.  [1]\n   In 1965, Barbieri, then a 27-year-old from  Tayport, Scotland, checked into the  Maryfield Hospital in  Dundee. Initially only a short  fast was planned, due to the doctors believing that short fasts were preferable to longer ones. Barbieri insisted on continuing because &#34;he adapted so well and was eager to reach his &#39;ideal&#39; weight&#34;.  [1] : 203  [2] For 382 days ending on 11 July 1966, he consumed only vitamins, electrolytes, an unspecified amount of yeast (a source of all essential amino acids) and zero-calorie beverages such as tea, coffee, and sparkling water, although he occasionally consumed small amounts of milk and/or sugar with the beverages, especially during the final weeks of the fast. He quit working at his father&#39;s fish and chip shop, which closed down during the fast. Barbieri&#39;s starting weight was recorded at 456 pounds (207\u00a0kg) and he stopped fasting when he reached his goal weight of 180 pounds (82\u00a0kg). After his weight loss, he moved to  Warwick and had two sons. Barbieri died in September 1990.  [2]\n  In the 1971 edition of   The Guinness Book of Records, Barbieri&#39;s 382-day fast was recognized as the longest recorded.  [1] : 203  [2] In 1973, Dennis Galer Goodwin went on a hunger strike for 385 days, but he was force-fed during this period. As of 2016 , Barbieri retains the record for the longest fast without solid food, according to Guinness officials.

Plus the countless number of LinkedIn profiles we proactively screened ourselves, with approximately 50 or so people we reached out to asking them to apply. 64 applicants had a phone screen with our recruiter or the hiring manager (that&#39;s me!). 10 made it through to a full interview loop and case study with the broader team. 1 offer went out. 1 offer was accepted.\n I wish a submitted CV was a fair and objective representation of somebody&#39;s experience and their potential. That isn&#39;t the case though. And so we have this imperfect process filled with potential bias made worse by incomplete information. I&#39;d love to be able to speak to each and every applicant to try give them the best opportunity possible to let themselves shine. That&#39;s not going to happen with 814 applicants though. There&#39;s going to be some sort of filtering required to distill it down to a number we can manage. That might mean we miss out on someone great, and that makes me sad.\n  While I&#39;ve got your attention, I&#39;m Glenn and it&#39;s great to meet you! \ud83d\udc4b    I&#39;m currently Director of Product @  HashiCorp,and we&#39;re  hiring!

If you&#39;d like to work with us please get an application in ASAP.\n  Especially given we were hiring for a Senior Product Manager at the time I was ok not cutting too much slack on CVs that didn&#39;t present well. Because like it or not, especially as someone applying for a senior role, your CV is in itself implicity the first test in the process. You have a potential customer (the recruiter/hiring manager) and you&#39;re trying to understand their needs and find them a solution (you!) to solve it.\n And so that&#39;s the journey I&#39;m going to go through today. A look at what it&#39;s like on the other side of this review process. The common pitfalls I see. The mistakes people make that either make it hard to get a sense for what they&#39;d be brining to the role or why they&#39;re different to the other hundreds of people we&#39;re potentially going to talk to.\n Because no matter what level of experience we&#39;re talking about the best problem for me to have is to have  too many amazing people with great potential.\n  This has been an eye-opening thing for me and has forced me to rethink some of my own long established process bias. I used to loathe cover letters. Too often they seemed like a pointless procedural thing that people just did because that&#39;s what they were told to do. Looking back I think I&#39;ve also been carrying the scars from hiring many, many years ago. Back when a HR team would physically dump a pile of printed out CVs on your desk to review. And cover letters and CVs would invariably end up becoming separated and you&#39;d get half way through and realise you&#39;d matched up two print outs for completely different people and then... well it was all just a mess.\n  Correlation is not causation, blah blah. But... I&#39;ve found it curious often a strong application also had a interest piquing cover letter submitted with it. Addressing the topics called out in the posted job description. Showing some curiosity for the role, at least a passing familiarity with the company or product. It&#39;s the opportunity to make the application is tailored specifically to the employer. Which is in part the first step in also trying to communicate that the person applying is perfectly tailored to the role. Back in my old timey days we expected the actual CV to be tailored to the role you were applying for. I&#39;ve got a half dozen slight variations of my own based on whether I was applying for a management role, one as an individual contributor, early stage vs large scale company, etc..\n This is step one in your opportunity to showcase your skills as a product manager. The job description has a list of expectations, you need to show you&#39;ve noticed them and help connect the dots directly to your relevant experience. Tailor your CV to speak to them directly, or write a cover letter that addresses them. The latter seems far more scalable if you&#39;re applying to multiple jobs.\n  I worked at a place that specialised in internet marketing and I still remember very trite advice I&#39;d hear in those circles: &#34;The subject line in an email has one job: to get someone to open the email&#34;. It&#39;s always served me as a good reminder that, especially when you&#39;re dealing with an audience that might have limited attention, you&#39;ve got to give them a reason to keep reading. If you don&#39;t want to take your lead from some internet marketing advice (but hey, why not? You are trying to market yourself here!) then maybe you should consider the  inverted pyramid approach commonly used in journalism, or the  BLUF approach used in military communication.\n   # Glenn Gillen ## Educational Experience* A college you&#39;ve never heard of - 20 years ago## Skills* Photoshop* MS Word* JIRA* Black belt in taekwondo\n  # Glenn Gillen ## Experience ### Job Title, Last Company* Biggest highlight, biggest impact, wow factor moment goes here\n There&#39;s some subtle signaling here in what you think is important and/or your ability to surface what you think the reader wants to learn about you. If you went to some world famous school 20 years ago you think it&#39;s worth putting that front and center. Who am I to disagree? But for the rest us, the schooling choices we made a decade or more ago probably aren&#39;t  the most important thing to tell someone. Same with the skills. Personally it doesn&#39;t matter to me if someone knows how to use JIRA or not. It&#39;s an interesting tidbit to know but it&#39;s also totally irrelevant to whether I&#39;ll hire them. Never used it before? It&#39;s fine, I&#39;m pretty confident we can help you learn it quickly.\n    ## Product Manager - Company A, most recent* Engaged stakeholders* Gathered requirements from customers* Delivered solutions* An extensive list of generic product management tasks## Product Manager - Company B, a little while ago* Engaged stakeholders* Gathered requirements from customers* Delivered solutions* An extensive list of generic product management tasks\n  ## Senior Product Manager - Company A, most recent* Facilitated design sprints, including rapid prototyping and user testing to validate approach for new product launch. * Scoped down intial launch requirements to ensure a delightful experience for an initial target cohort.* Over 40k signups in first month, but with 25% churn.

High collaboration with engineering peers through this process to iterate towards potential solutions.\n I&#39;m not going to say the first example is bad per se. Because it&#39;s the format of about half of the applications that came in. Therein lies the biggest problem though: you&#39;re completely undifferentiated amongst a sea of hundreds of other people. The other problem with the first approach is it doesn&#39;t really tell me much about what you&#39;ve actually done. It&#39;s a collection of overly abstract process bullet points. There&#39;s no evidence of how or where they were applied. No outcomes. No sense of what exactly you&#39;ve worked on. What&#39;s interesting about  your experience? No growth or development. Just generic PM experience after generic experience, each one the same as the previous, and the same as everybody else.\n  At the end of the day though it shouldn&#39;t be about copy &amp; pasting someone elses playbook or blindlyembracing their opinions. It&#39;s about developing a process, being reflective of what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not, and iterating on it. If you&#39;re not making it to the interview stage you need to work out why. Try arranging for 5 of your friends to get on a video call, give them 3 minutes to read/skim your CV or application, and then ask them what they can recall from it (without referring back to it). Is that the same few points you want your next employer to notice? If not, how do you bring more focus to the key points?\n The main job of your CV in a job application is to get you the next stage. Give the hiring manage a reason to  want to call you.\n Hi, I&#39;m Glenn! \ud83d\udc4b I&#39;m currently Director of Product @  HashiCorp, and we&#39;re  hiring!
