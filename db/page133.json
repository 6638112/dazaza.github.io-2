Smoking in public and in front of children is banned.\n      Mexico United Against Crime, a non-governmental organisation, said the decision &#34;does not decriminalise the activities necessary to carry out consumption&#34; such as possession and transportation.\n Mexico&#39;s lower house  approved a bill legalising the recreational use of cannabis in March, but it still needs final approval by the Senate.\n The legislation would let users with a permit carry up to 28g and grow as many as eight plants at home for personal use. At present, it is illegal to carry more than five grams.\n Supporters of legalisation hope it could reduce some of the violence related to illegal drugs trade, which claims the lives of thousands of

video platform had banned the channel for violating its rules.\n &#34;Right Wing Watch&#39;s YouTube  channel was mistakenly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,&#34; the tech company said in a statement.\n  It attributed the mistake to the large volume of videos on its site. YouTube automates much of the content moderation for the more than 500 hours of content that it says are uploaded every minute, and it said it tries to act quickly when a channel is mistakenly removed.\n   Right Wing Watch is a project of People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group founded in 1981 and based in Washington, D.C. The project had been posting video clips from politicians, preachers and other figures for more than 10 years on YouTube, carving out an audience of about  47,000 subscribers.\n Earlier Monday, Right Wing Watch said it had received a notice of a permanent ban related to rules violations in the video clips that it posts, which often show examples of alleged hate speech, conspiracy theories and other prohibited content.\n The group said the ban was an ironic outcome of YouTube trying to enforce its rules, as the company targeted not just the original source of material such as conspiracy theories, but also those who seek to document it.\n &#34;Our efforts to expose the bigoted view and dangerous conspiracy theories spread by right-wing activists has now resulted in @YouTube\u00a0banning our channel and removing thousands of our videos,&#34; Right Wing Watch had said in a  statement  early Monday.\n  Some conservative activists had  delighted in the removal, noting in posts on Twitter that Right Wing Watch had often called on YouTube to ban them or their allies for rules violations. But others said the ban showed a troubling inability by YouTube to distinguish between creators of prohibited content and those countering it.\n  YouTube and Right Wing Watch have battled for years over the presence of extremist videos.\n In October, Right Wing Watch said that YouTube  removed one of its videos documenting content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory, but had left up the original YouTube channel where the group found the content.\u00a0It reported a similar  dynamic in April with content related to the 2020 presidential election.\n  Kyle Mantyla, a senior fellow at Right Wing Watch, said in an interview that the project got two &#34;strikes&#34; from YouTube in April for clips about election-related conspiracy theories. He said YouTube delivered a third and final &#34;strike&#34; earlier this month for an eight-year-old video of a religious broadcaster who was denouncing gays.\n  &#34;Their inability to differentiate between the people who are trying to advocate this stuff and those who are trying to document and counter it is at the heart of the problem here,&#34; he said.\n He said early Monday that, beginning in 2019, the group began switching to the rival service Vimeo as its video host.\n  &#34;Without the ability to accurately portray dangerous behavior, meaningful journalism and public education about that behavior would cease to exist,&#34; Right Wing Watch Director Adele Stan said\u00a0in a statement.\n  &#34;We hope this is the end of a years-long struggle with YouTube to understand the nature of our work,&#34; she said.\n Journalists and researchers have warned for years about social media networks inadvertently erasing evidence of extremism or violence as they try to rid their services of objectionable material. In a report last year, Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group that investigates abuses worldwide,  warned that YouTube and other tech companies were failing to archive potential evidence of serious crimes including war crimes.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:41:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u6062\u590d,reinstates", "title": "YouTube\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u53f3\u7ffc\u624b\u8868 ", "title_en": "YouTube reinstates Right Wing Watch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtube-reinstates-channel-devoted-exposing-conservative-extremism-rcna1286", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u6062\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9895536060bdbda218c9640d64556e35.jpg", "infoid": 1068467, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6fc0\u5149\u6210\u4e3a\u6574\u4e2a\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u7c89\u4e1d\u5e2d\u5377\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u611f\u89c9\u597d\u50cf\u5c4f\u5e55\u5f00\u59cb\u6269\u5927\u3002\n \u6211\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u8001\u77f3\u5efa\u7b51......\u5c31\u50cf\u4e00\u5ea7\u57ce\u5821......\u6211\u5728\u5b83\u4e0a\u9762\u98de\u884c\u3002\n   \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u89c2\u770b\uff06\uff0334;

on their computers \u2013 an intense full-screen, red-and-black flicker  that anyone can access online and that we use in our experiments.\n In less than ten minutes, it creates altered states of  consciousness, with no lasting effects for the brain. Visual experiences set in almost as soon as you start looking at it.\n But our new study,  published in  Cortex, shows that while some people see castles or fractals in the Ganzflicker, others see nothing. We have come up with a theory of where those individual differences come from.\n Like a computer screen, the part of your brain that processes visual information (the visual cortex) has a refresh &#34;button&#34; which helps it sample the environment \u2013  taking snapshots of the world in quick succession.\n In other words, your brain collects sensory information with a certain frequency. Yet you see the world as continuous and dynamic, thanks to your brain&#39;s sophisticated ability to fill in the blanks.\n For example, your eyes have a blind spot right outside the center of vision, but you don&#39;t see a patch of blackness everywhere you look. Your visual cortex extrapolates from the surrounding visual information so that your whole field of view  appears to be complete. If the sensory information being processed is the Ganzflicker, this will interact with your brain&#39;s own rhythms to alter how you fill in or interpret what you are seeing.\n   Ganzflicker is known to elicit the experience of anomalous sensory information in the external environment, called pseudo-hallucinations. &#34;Simple&#34; experiences - like seeing lasers or illusory colours - have previously been explained as your brain reacting to  clashes between Ganzflicker and the brain&#39;s rhythms.\n   The brain is composed of many different regions interacting with each other, including &#34;low-level&#34; sensory regions and regions that correspond to &#34;high-level&#34; cognitive processes. Discriminating whether a line is vertical or horizontal, for example, is considered a low-level sensory process, whereas determining whether a face is friendly or annoyed is a high-level cognitive process. The latter is more open to interpretation.\n Visual mental imagery, or the mental simulation of sensory information \u2013 the &#34;mind&#39;s eye&#34; \u2013 is one of these high-level cognitive processes. High-level processes can interact with low-level processes to shape your brain&#39;s interpretation of what you are seeing.\n If someone sees simple pseudo-hallucinations in the Ganzflicker, their brains may automatically interpret that information as more meaningful or realistic with help from their mind&#39;s eye.\n   What most people don&#39;t realise is that everyone&#39;s imagery is different. Some people have imagery that is as vivid as actually seeing something in front of them. A small proportion of people have a &#34;blind mind&#39;s eye&#34; and cannot even visualize the faces of their friends or family. This condition  is called aphantasia, and has attracted an increasing amount of attention in the last few years.\n   It is very difficult to describe and compare imagery experiences, since they are private, internal, subjective events. But it turns out that the Ganzflicker can help.\n We discovered that imagery ability can be reflected in an individual&#39;s description of a ten-minute experience with Ganzflicker. Almost half of people with aphantasia see absolutely nothing in the Ganzflicker.\n The other half see mostly simple patterns like geometric shapes or illusory colors. Compare that to people with visual mental imagery, for whom the majority see meaningful complex objects, such as animals and faces. Some even see entire pseudo-hallucinatory environments, like a stormy beach or a medieval castle.\n   Going back to the idea of brain rhythms, it&#39;s possible that people who see imagery have naturally lower-frequency rhythms in visual cortex - closer to the Ganzflicker frequency - which makes them susceptible to experiencing pseudo-hallucinations.\n People with aphantasia, on the other hand, have naturally higher-frequency rhythms in the visual cortex \u2013 which may give them a buffer against the effects of the Ganzflicker.\n Our theory is that mental imagery and pseudo-hallucinations elicited by Ganzflicker are tapping into the same processes in the brain. This means that Ganzflicker captures a dynamic projection of people&#39;s imagined experiences, like opening a window to the mind&#39;s eye.\n Ganzflicker is therefore a promising tool for understanding individual differences in mental imagery and its interaction with the visual environment.\n The experiment can help people share their unique experiences with each other \u2013 ultimately bringing subjective experience into the real world.\n  This article is republished from  The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
