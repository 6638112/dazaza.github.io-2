This is someone trying to be funny with me,&#34; he thought, and he hung up the phone.</p><p>2017年4月的一天傍晚，这位当时46岁的加密货币企业家在巴西岛屿城市弗洛里安奥波利斯的办公室工作时接到了一个电话，告诉他，比特币将在未来几个小时内收到正式的赎金要求&#34;这只是另一个骗子。这是一个想跟我开玩笑的人；他想了想，就挂了电话。</p><p> He checked in with his family&#39;s maid anyway. His 32-year-old spouse had taken their daughter to school hours earlier, only a stone&#39;s throw from the family home, but never came home, the maid said. She didn&#39;t know where his wife had gone. That&#39;s when Lopes checked his home&#39;s security-camera system.</p><p>他与家人登记入住&#39；反正她是女佣。他32岁的配偶早几个小时就带女儿去上学了，只不过是一块石头&#39；“我们从家里扔出去，但再也没有回家，”女佣说。她没有&#39；我不知道他妻子去了哪里。那&#39；当洛佩斯检查他的家时&#39；美国的安全摄像系统。</p><p> Blurry CCTV footage from shortly after lunch that day showed several people loitering on the street just past his garden. His wife walked down the sidewalk toward their home when a man in a black-and-white top approached her.</p><p>那天午饭后不久的模糊闭路电视画面显示，有几个人在他花园旁边的街道上闲逛。他的妻子沿着人行道向他们家走去，这时一个穿着黑白上衣的男人走近了她。</p><p> She recoiled. A person in white swooped in behind her to intercept her. The huddle momentarily disappeared behind a fence. A few seconds later, pressed close to the person in white, she was hurried down a side street, and vanished.</p><p>她退缩了。一个穿白色衣服的人突然冲到她身后拦截她。那群人瞬间消失在篱笆后面。几秒钟后，她被紧紧地按在那个穿白衣的人身边，急忙沿着一条小街消失了。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s hard when you see someone you love is taken from you. It&#39;s really, really difficult,&#34; he said in an interview. &#34;My first thing was: &#39;Holy shit. What am I going to do now? I have no idea.&#39; I was not prepared for that kind of situation.&#34;</p><p>&#34;它&#39；当你看到你爱的人从你身边被夺走时，这很难。它&#39；这真的很难，&#34；他在接受采访时说&#34;我的第一件事是：&#39；天啊。我现在该怎么办？我不知道&#39; 我没有为这种情况做好准备&#34;</p><p> Lopes had made a name for himself in Brazil as the head of the blockchain firm CoinBR and a few months earlier had sold the operation to Stratum, where he still worked. The kidnappers&#39; demands were high. They wanted tens of millions of dollars, paid in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>洛佩斯作为区块链公司CoinBR的负责人在巴西名声大噪，几个月前，他将业务出售给了Stratum，至今仍在那里工作。绑架者&#39；要求很高。他们想要数千万美元，以各种加密货币支付。</p><p> &#34;Either you pay, or we kill her,&#34; Lopes recounted the hostage-takers telling him via WhatsApp. &#34;We&#39;re gonna send pieces of her to you.&#34;</p><p>&#34;要么你付钱，要么我们杀了她，&#34；洛佩斯讲述了劫持者通过WhatsApp告诉他的情况&#34;我们&#39；我们会把她的碎片寄给你&#34;</p><p>   Investors and techies who made early bets on crypto are now hailed as revolutionary financial prophets and gilded with the allure of sudden wealth — often flaunted through a  conspicuous-consumption culture of &#34;Lambos,&#34; yacht parties, aggressive boostering, million-dollar profile pictures, and crypto-branded everything.</p><p>早期押注加密技术的投资者和技术人员现在被誉为革命性的金融预言家，并被突如其来的财富所吸引——通常通过一种引人注目的消费文化来炫耀&#34；兰博斯和#34；游艇派对，激进的助推，百万美元的个人资料图片，以及加密品牌的一切。</p><p>   Hacks and digital scams are a dime a dozen in crypto circles — but security experts, investors, and others in the space say not enough attention is being paid to physical crimes targeting crypto owners, from simple robberies to home invasions, kidnappings, torture, and even murder.</p><p>黑客和数字骗局在加密领域可谓数不胜数，但安全专家、投资者和其他业内人士表示，针对加密所有者的实体犯罪，从简单的抢劫到入室抢劫、绑架、酷刑，甚至谋杀，没有得到足够的重视。</p><p> Such attacks illustrate a fundamental weak link in the blockchain-based digital currencies that tout new levels of financial security and privacy: For all the  complex cryptographic math that underpins the integrity of cryptocurrencies, if someone with a gun forces you to hand yours over, there&#39;s not much you can do about it.</p><p>此类攻击说明了基于区块链的数字货币中的一个根本薄弱环节，这些数字货币标榜着新的金融安全和隐私水平：对于支撑加密货币完整性的所有复杂加密数学，如果有人持枪强迫你交出你的，那么&#39；你对此无能为力。</p><p>  Jameson Lopp, a privacy-focused technologist and bitcoin advocate, has made a habit of tracking physical security threats to cryptocurrency users. His interest in the subject is personal. In October 2017, a heavily armed police unit descended on his North Carolina home after an anonymous hoaxer swatted him, submitting a false hostage report to law enforcement, as part of an effort to extort him for bitcoin.</p><p>Jameson Lopp是一位关注隐私的技术专家和比特币倡导者，他养成了追踪加密货币用户的物理安全威胁的习惯。他对这个问题的兴趣是个人的。2017年10月，一名匿名恶作剧者殴打了他，并向执法部门提交了一份虚假的人质报告，作为勒索他的比特币行动的一部分，一支全副武装的警察部队突袭了他在北卡罗来纳州的家。</p><p> &#34;On one hand it was a kind of amusement and bewilderment because I knew about swatting stuff — it was always something that I figured would only really happen to celebrities,&#34; he said. &#34;On the other hand it was extreme anxiety and, you know, not wanting the cops to run into my house and potentially shoot my dog.&#34;</p><p>&#34;一方面，这是一种娱乐和困惑，因为我知道拍东西——我一直认为这只会发生在名人身上，&#34；他说&#34;另一方面，这是极度焦虑，你知道，不希望警察跑进我家，并有可能射杀我的狗&#34;</p><p> Since then, he has been tracking physical attacks targeting crypto owners, from swatting attempts like the one he faced to kidnappings and more. He has  identified almost 100 incidents publicly reported in the media over the past few years, and he believes that number is most likely a drastic undercount as a result of victims not wanting to attract more attention from criminals.</p><p>从那以后，他一直在追踪针对加密软件所有者的物理攻击，从他面临的打击尝试到绑架等等。在过去几年里，他已经确认了媒体公开报道的近100起事件，他认为这一数字很可能是由于受害者不想引起犯罪分子更多关注而造成的严重漏报。</p><p> Lopp&#39;s list reads like a comprehensive primer to different flavors of violence across the globe. A man who was drugged by his Tinder date to induce him to give up his passwords. A 14-year-old schoolboy in Northern England who  was beaten and held for ransom after bragging on social media about his crypto-trading profits. A digital trader in the Netherlands targeted by attackers dressed as police officers who broke into his home in 2019 and tortured him with an electric drill in front of his 4-year-old daughter in an attempt to force him to surrender his crypto holdings.</p><p>洛普和#39；这张清单读起来像是一本全面的入门书，介绍了全球不同的暴力形式。一名男子被他的点火约会对象下药，诱使他放弃密码。英格兰北部一名14岁的小学生在社交媒体上吹嘘自己的加密交易利润后被殴打并勒索赎金。2019年，荷兰一名数字交易员被装扮成警察的袭击者锁定，闯入他的家，在他4岁的女儿面前用电钻折磨他，试图迫使他交出加密资产。</p><p> These incidents have become colloquially known as &#34;$5 wrench attacks&#34; — a reference to a  webcomic by the &#34;xkcd&#34; artist Randall Munroe in 2009. It jokes about how a &#34;crypto nerd&#34; might like to imagine that a bad guy&#39;s plot is foiled when faced with unbreakable encryption, but the reality is often simpler: &#34;Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.&#34; (This forcible approach to obtaining someone&#39;s private keys is also euphemistically known among cryptographers as &#34;rubber-hose cryptanalysis.&#34;)</p><p>这些事件通俗地称为&#34$5.扳手攻击&#34；-引用由&#34；xkcd和#34；2009年艺术家兰德尔·门罗。它开玩笑说a&#34；加密书呆子&#34；可能会想象一个坏人&#39；当面对牢不可破的加密时，他的阴谋失败了，但现实往往更简单：&#34；毒死他，用这把5美元的扳手打他，直到他告诉我们密码&#34; （这种强行获取某人私钥的方法在密码学家中也被委婉地称为胶管密码分析。）</p><p> Cryptocurrencies are different from other financial assets in one important way: Most assets in finance today are no longer &#34;bearer assets,&#34; Lopp said. &#34;They&#39;re generally controlled by some sort of authority that can revoke access or return access if it gets transferred incorrectly,&#34; he said, describing bitcoin as &#34;really more of a reversion back to a gold or physical-commodity type of asset such that if you get ahold of it and you can get away with it, then no one can just claw back.&#34;</p><p>加密货币在一个重要方面不同于其他金融资产：当今金融业的大多数资产不再是&#34；无记名资产和#34；洛普说&#34;他们&#39；他们通常由某种权威机构控制，如果访问权被错误地转移，他们可以撤销访问权或返回访问权，&#34；他说，比特币是&#34；实际上，更多的是回归到黄金或实物商品类型的资产，这样，如果你掌握了它，并且可以逃脱惩罚，那么就没有人可以收回&#34;</p><p>   Combined with the lack of real identities tied to digital wallets, and their ease of transferability — the keys for tens of millions of dollars&#39; worth of bitcoin can be stuck on a USB stick, inconspicuously emailed, or even written down and mailed — crypto is a uniquely attractive target.</p><p>再加上缺乏与数字钱包相关的真实身份，以及它们的易转移性——数千万美元的钥匙&#39；价值相当的比特币可以被粘贴在U盘上，不显眼地通过电子邮件发送，甚至被写下来并邮寄——加密是一个独特的吸引人的目标。</p><p>  In the early hours of a June morning in 2021, an entrepreneur stumbled out of an after-party for the Bitcoin Miami conference and into what he thought was an ordinary cab waiting outside a South Florida club.</p><p>2021年初的一个六月早晨，一位企业家从比特币迈阿密会议后的一个聚会上跌跌撞撞，走进了他认为是在南佛罗里达俱乐部外面等待的一辆普通出租车。</p><p> The driver asked for his passenger&#39;s phone for &#34;directions,&#34; and, intoxicated, the entrepreneur handed it over. But the driver kept asking for his phone pin, and the entrepreneur slowly realized he was being driven the opposite direction of his hotel. The driver then demanded more than $100 — far more than the fare — before he&#39;d take him home.</p><p>司机要他的乘客&#39；s电话&#34；方向&#34；这位企业家醉醺醺地把它交了出去。但司机一直在问他的电话号码，这位企业家慢慢意识到，他正被带到酒店的相反方向。然后，司机索要了100多美元——远高于车费——然后他&#39；我会带他回家。</p><p> After somehow persuading the driver to temporarily pass his phone back, the entrepreneur jumped out at a red light, miles away from his hotel, only to realize the driver had disabled his phone by removing the SIM card.</p><p>在以某种方式说服司机暂时把手机还给他后，这位企业家在离酒店几英里远的一个红灯处跳了出来，结果发现司机拔下了SIM卡，手机被禁用了。</p><p> The pair hadn&#39;t directly discussed crypto, and it&#39;s unclear whether the driver was planning to look for digital-currency wallets on the phone or whether it was instead a traditional robbery attempt. But, the entrepreneur told Insider in an interview, the abundance of wealthy cryptocurrency owners in the area was hardly a secret: &#34;This was BTC Miami. If you&#39;ve been around that week, you know, there&#39;s a bunch of crypto people there.&#34;</p><p>这对夫妇没有&#39；t直接讨论了密码，它&#39；目前尚不清楚这位司机是否打算在手机上寻找数字货币钱包，或者这是一次传统的抢劫企图。但是，这位企业家在接受《内部人士》采访时表示，该地区拥有大量富有的加密货币的人绝非秘密：；这里是BTC迈阿密。如果你&#39；你知道，那一周我一直在那里&#39；那里有一群加密人&#34;</p><p> For the entrepreneur it was a reminder of the vulnerability of his cryptocurrency holdings. Had the driver accessed his on-phone crypto wallet, he said, &#34;he could&#39;ve stolen enough for a house payment.&#34;</p><p>对这位企业家来说，这提醒了他加密货币的脆弱性。他说，如果司机打开了他的手机加密钱包，&#34；他可以&#39；我偷了足够的钱买房&#34;</p><p>  With its public displays of braggadocio and financial boasting, the crypto culture is inherently performative. Bullish crypto devotees identify themselves by adding laser eyes to their online profile pictures, and they broadcast their predilection for preferred coins with all manner of memes and catchphrases.</p><p>加密文化以其炫耀和财务吹嘘的公开展示，具有内在的表演性。乐观的加密爱好者通过在他们的在线个人资料图片中添加激光眼睛来识别自己，他们用各种各样的模因和流行语来传播他们对首选硬币的偏好。</p><p> It&#39;s not hard to find people sharing their latest crypto trades on Twitter and Instagram, bragging about their commitment to hanging (or &#34;hodling&#34;) on to all their crypto holdings and showing off some of the expensive, often bitcoin-branded swag they&#39;ve acquired thanks to their crypto riches.</p><p>它&#39；不难发现有人在Twitter和Instagram上分享他们最新的加密交易，吹嘘他们对绞刑的承诺（或胡闹）在他们所有的加密资产上炫耀他们的一些昂贵的、通常是比特币品牌的行当&#39；多亏了他们的加密财富。</p><p> That kind of behavior is a beacon to enterprising criminals, said Rigel Walshe, a burly, tattoo-covered New Zealander who worked as a cop protecting his nation&#39;s prime minister before becoming a developer at a crypto startup. &#34;You could, if you&#39;ve done your homework, find a person or a group of persons where if you and a team of five well-trained individuals showed up with a gun, you&#39;d very likely be able to walk out with a very substantial amount of money,&#34; Walshe said.</p><p>新西兰人里格尔·沃尔什（Rigel Walshe）说，这种行为是有进取心的罪犯的灯塔。他身材魁梧，身上有纹身，曾是一名保护国家的警察；在成为一家加密初创公司的开发人员之前，他是英国首相&#34;你可以，如果你&#39；如果你做了功课，找到一个人或一群人，如果你和一个由五名训练有素的人组成的团队带着枪出现，你&#39；d很可能会带着一大笔钱离开，&#34；她说。</p><p> He added: &#34;That&#39;s no different than any other sort of wealth stuff, right? You&#39;re flashy about what you have, then you&#39;re more likely to be robbed.&#34;</p><p>他补充道：&#34；那&#39；It’这和任何其他类型的财富都一样，对吧？你&#39；如果你对你所拥有的东西很浮华，那么你&#39；你更有可能被抢劫&#34;</p><p>  NFTs — buzzy, art-linked digital assets — also present unique security risks. They&#39;re often used as flashy profile pictures on public-facing social media, and there are clear records of their sometimes-astronomical values (the famous  &#34;Bored Ape Yacht Club&#34; NFTs have been sold for multimillion-dollar sums), but custodial tools aren&#39;t yet readily available to most people for protecting them.</p><p>NFT——时髦的、与艺术相关的数字资产——也存在独特的安全风险。他们&#39；在面向公众的社交媒体上，它们经常被用作浮华的个人资料图片，而且它们有时具有天文数字的价值（著名的无聊猿游艇俱乐部NFT以数百万美元的价格出售），但保管工具却没有；大多数人还没有现成的方法来保护他们。</p><p> &#34;These NFTs are starting to be worth a lot of money, millions of dollars,&#34; a venture investor warned. &#34;For the most part, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re using institutional-grade custody solutions.&#34;</p><p>&#34;这些NFT已经开始值很多钱，数百万美元，&#34；一位风险投资者发出警告&#34;在大多数情况下，我不&#39；我不认为他们&#39；重新使用机构级监护解决方案&#34;</p><p>  Unlike cybersecurity threats, like    phishing    and hacking, that have become well-understood among the public, there is less thought paid to real-life assaults — in part because such physical robberies are more difficult to pull off and, consequently, much less common. And, as was the case with two clients of the security consultant Karl Perman, victims often prefer to stay mum. Despite losing millions in digital assets as a result of home invasions last year, the victims avoided all publicity about the burglaries, Perman said, with one not even talking to the police.</p><p>与网络安全威胁（如网络钓鱼和黑客攻击）不同的是，人们对现实生活中的攻击考虑较少，部分原因是此类实体抢劫更难实施，因此也就不那么常见了。而且，就像安全顾问卡尔·佩尔曼的两位客户一样，受害者往往更愿意保持沉默。佩尔曼说，尽管去年因入室盗窃而损失了数百万数字资产，但受害者避免了所有有关入室盗窃的宣传，其中一人甚至没有与警方交谈。</p><p> The total number of such attacks is unknown, and it&#39;s unclear to what degree they&#39;re on law enforcement&#39;s radar. An FBI representative, when asked whether the agency tracked these crimes or whether the bureau could comment on their prevalence, said &#34;we do not have information to provide.&#34;</p><p>此类攻击的总数不得而知，目前为39起；目前尚不清楚他们在多大程度上&#39；关于执法&#39；这是雷达。当被问及联邦调查局是否追踪了这些罪行，或者联邦调查局是否可以对这些罪行的普遍程度发表评论时，一名联邦调查局代表说&#34；我们没有可以提供的信息&#34;</p><p> But crypto crime is almost as old as cryptocurrency. The first cryptocurrency enthusiast to grapple it with appears to have been Hal Finney, a 58-year-old cryptographer and early bitcoin adopter who some suspect may have secretly been  Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.</p><p>但加密犯罪几乎和加密货币一样古老。第一个与之抗争的加密货币爱好者似乎是58岁的密码学家哈尔·芬尼，他是比特币的早期使用者，一些人怀疑他可能是比特币的化名创造者中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto）。</p><p> Finney had the degenerative disease ALS, and in the months before he died in 2014 he was subjected to a vicious extortion campaign by an assailant demanding $400,000 worth of bitcoin. At one point his home was swatted, with the prank call prompting an armed police response.</p><p>芬尼患有退行性疾病ALS，在2014年去世前的几个月里，他遭到了一名攻击者的恶意勒索，要求获得价值40万美元的比特币。他的家一度遭到殴打，恶作剧电话引发了武警的回应。</p><p>  Michael Arrington, a media entrepreneur turned crypto investor,  recently tweeted that he was &#34;forced&#34; to move out of an 8,300-square-foot Miami home, which he had recently purchased for $16 million. Arrington accused a Sotheby&#39;s real-estate agent of leaking information about the deal, sabotaging the efforts he said he&#39;d taken to keep the home&#39;s location a secret &#34;because of the unique and violent security threats against people in crypto.&#34;</p><p>迈克尔·阿灵顿（Michael Arrington）是一位媒体企业家，后来成为加密投资者，他最近在推特上说自己是&#34；强迫&#34；搬出他最近花1600万美元买下的迈阿密一栋8300平方英尺的房子。阿灵顿指控一家苏富比39；s房地产经纪人泄露了交易信息，破坏了他所说的他&#39；d被用来维持家庭&#39；它的位置是个秘密&#34；因为加密技术对人们的独特和暴力的安全威胁&#34;</p><p> Awareness of the risks is rising among some members of the gilded crypto class. Some have taken it to the extreme, going so far as to cloak their identities with usernames and pseudonyms — even among their coworkers — to maintain anonymity and personal security.</p><p>一些镀金加密阶层的成员对风险的认识正在上升。有些人走到了极端，甚至用用户名和化名来掩盖自己的身份——甚至在同事之间——以保持匿名和个人安全。</p><p> Demand for high-tech physical security gear and services is growing. Many owners of crypto rig up their homes with visible alarms and cameras. Panic rooms are not unheard of at some particularly wealthy figures&#39; properties, according to tech workers, along with executive-protection agents — as well as sniffer dogs that have occasionally been seen patrolling the grounds at parties.</p><p>对高科技物理安全设备和服务的需求正在增长。许多crypto的所有者用可见的警报器和摄像头来装饰他们的家。在一些特别富有的人物那里，恐慌室并非闻所未闻；据技术工作者说，这里有房产，还有行政保护人员，还有偶尔在派对上巡逻的嗅探犬。</p><p> People don&#39;t need to make themselves invulnerable; they just need to create enough of a hassle to make attackers decide to go after easier targets, said Nick Neuman, who cofounded the crypto-security firm Casa with Lopp and is its CEO. &#34;It&#39;s kind of like the joke or metaphor of running from the bear,&#34; he said. &#34;You just need to not be the slowest person.&#34;</p><p>人们不&#39；不需要让自己无懈可击；他们只需要制造足够的麻烦，让攻击者决定追捕更容易的目标，尼克·纽曼说。他是加密安全公司Casa与Lopp的联合创始人，也是该公司的首席执行官&#34;它&#39；这有点像逃离熊的笑话或隐喻；他说&#34;你只需要不是最慢的人&#34;</p><p> For some crypto owners that means using &#34;custodial&#34; services like Anchorage, Coinbase Custody, or Fireblocks to remotely store their crypto assets for them, essentially serving as a digital bank vault. This makes it more difficult for anyone to steal them or forcibly obtain them. &#34;If you kidnap me today, I have no direct control of the funds,&#34; a venture capitalist said of his firm&#39;s holdings. An alternative is &#34;multisig&#34; wallets, where the consent or signatures of multiple &#34;key holders&#34; are required to move funds — protecting assets even if one person is compromised.</p><p>对于一些加密所有者来说，这意味着使用&#34；保管和#34；Anchorage、Coinbase托管或Fireblock等服务可以远程存储他们的加密资产，基本上是一个数字银行保险库。这使得任何人都更难窃取或强行获取它们&#34;如果你今天绑架我，我对资金没有直接控制权；一位风险投资家谈到他的公司时说#39；s控股公司。另一种选择是&#34；multisig和#34；钱包，多人的同意或签名&#34；钥匙持有者&#34；被要求转移资金——保护资产，即使一个人受到威胁。</p><p>   Geography matters too, with some countries seen as presenting higher risks. The cartel in particular is viewed as a potential threat by some security professionals in the industry.</p><p>地理位置也很重要，一些国家被视为风险更高。该卡特尔尤其被业内一些安全专业人士视为潜在威胁。</p><p> But given the ethos of fierce independence among cryptocurrency devotees, there&#39;s an inherent wariness of third-party services. A core tenet of the crypto culture is &#34;Not your keys, not your coins.&#34; It refers to the idea that decentralized networks like bitcoin allow people to transact directly, without intermediaries. If you&#39;re relying on a bank-like service to hold the keys to your crypto, it&#39;s arguably no longer really yours.</p><p>但考虑到加密货币爱好者强烈的独立精神，有#39；这是对第三方服务固有的警惕。加密文化的核心宗旨是&#34；不是你的钥匙，不是你的硬币&#34; 它指的是像比特币这样的分散网络允许人们直接进行交易，而无需中间人。如果你&#39；我们依赖银行式的服务来持有密码的密钥，它&#39；它可能不再是你的了。</p><p> In some cases, crypto owners have resorted to decidedly old-fashioned methods to protect their high-tech treasures. One well-connected tech-industry figure said he knew someone who kept the keys to $350 million worth of cryptocurrencies in a physical safe and had another contact who buried the private keys for millions of dollars of cryptocurrencies in a forest for safekeeping.</p><p>在某些情况下，加密软件的所有者已经采取了绝对过时的方法来保护他们的高科技宝藏。一位关系密切的科技行业人士说，他认识一个人，他把价值3.5亿美元的加密货币的钥匙放在一个实体保险箱里，还有另一个联系人把价值数百万美元的加密货币的私钥埋在森林里保管。</p><p>  Rocelo Lopes spent days trying to persuade his wife&#39;s abductors not to harm her — and trying to persuade them to lower their initial demand of an eye-watering $40 million, to be paid via the privacy-focused cryptocurrencies ZCash and Monero.</p><p>罗塞洛·洛佩斯花了几天时间试图说服他的妻子&#39；她呼吁绑架者不要伤害她——并试图说服他们降低最初的要求，即通过以隐私为中心的加密货币ZCash和Monero支付令人垂涎三尺的4000万美元。</p><p> Eventually, the price dropped as low as $2 million. Then the kidnappers screwed up. They had been communicating with him via the encrypted messaging app WhatsApp, but one of them finally placed a call to him from a payphone near their location.</p><p>最终，价格降到了200万美元。然后绑架者搞砸了。他们一直在通过加密信息应用WhatsApp与他通信，但其中一人最终在他们所在地附近的付费电话上给他打了个电话。</p><p> Despite the warnings not to, Lopes had secretly looped in law enforcement, and police investigators were able to identify the hostage-takers&#39; location: São Paulo, a 10-hour drive away. Armed police officers descended on the location and were able to free the hostage and arrest many of the conspirators, killing one in the process. Lopes&#39; wife was unharmed.</p><p>尽管有警告不要这样做，洛佩斯还是秘密参与了执法活动，警方调查人员能够识别劫持人质者#39；地点：圣保罗，10小时车程。武警突袭了现场，释放了人质，逮捕了许多同谋者，并在过程中杀死了一人。洛佩斯和#39；妻子安然无恙。</p><p> In the aftermath, he reassessed his approach to security. His family moved to a more secure condominium, bought a bulletproof car, and hired bodyguards to protect his wife and children.</p><p>事后，他重新评估了自己的安全措施。他的家人搬到了一个更安全的公寓，买了一辆防弹车，并雇了保镖来保护他的妻子和孩子。</p><p> At the time Lopes&#39; wife was kidnapped in 2017, bitcoin was on an upward tear at about $1,300 a coin. In 2022, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are worth many times that. Even after  the recent crash in crypto values, bitcoin is worth nearly $44,000 a coin — and many owners of crypto assets are no better prepared than Lopes was in 2017.</p><p>当时洛佩斯&#39；2017年，妻子被绑架，比特币价格上涨，每枚约1300美元。2022年，比特币和其他加密货币的价值是这一数字的许多倍。即使在最近的加密价值暴跌之后，比特币的价值也接近每枚44000美元——而且许多加密资产的所有者并没有比洛佩斯在2017年做好更好的准备。</p><p> In November, attackers broke into the Spanish home of the social-media entrepreneur Zaryn Dentzel and tortured him in an attempt to force him to give up tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin. Ten days later, thieves elsewhere in Spain forcibly  stole a bitcoin ATM from a Barcelona store after ramming it with an SUV. The following month, two men were arrested in Indonesia over a robbery that cost a couple $400,000 in cryptocurrency and cash. Two weeks after that,  11 people serving time at a jail in Ontario were accused of taking two of their fellow prisoners hostage to force them to transfer their cryptocurrency holdings.</p><p>11月，袭击者闯入社交媒体企业家扎林·丹泽尔（Zaryn Dentzel）在西班牙的家中，对他施以酷刑，试图迫使他放弃数千万美元的比特币。十天后，西班牙其他地方的小偷用一辆SUV撞毁了巴塞罗那一家商店的比特币ATM机，并强行将其偷走。接下来的一个月，两名男子在印度尼西亚因一起抢劫案被捕，这起抢劫案耗资40万美元的加密货币和现金。两周后，在安大略省一所监狱服刑的11人被指控劫持两名囚犯作为人质，迫使他们转移持有的加密货币。</p><p> &#34;This is still pretty niche and edge-case type of thing,&#34; Lopp said. &#34;But you know as the space goes more mainstream, it&#39;s something that we expect to come up more and more often — just because more malicious-minded people will be testing out to see what the risk and reward is for trying to physically attack people who have bitcoin and other digital assets.&#34;</p><p>&#34;这仍然是相当利基和边缘案例类型的东西，&#34；洛普说&#34;但你知道，随着空间变得更加主流，它&#39；这是我们预计会越来越频繁地出现的事情——只是因为越来越多怀有恶意的人将进行测试，看看试图对拥有比特币和其他数字资产的人进行物理攻击的风险和回报是什么&#34;</p><p>  By clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.</p><p>点击“注册”，即表示您同意接收内幕人士以及其他合作伙伴的营销电子邮件，并接受我们的服务条款和隐私政策。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/绑架/">#绑架</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nft/">#nft</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/加密/">#加密</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
