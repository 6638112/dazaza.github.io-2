It has been months since she recovered from Covid-19, but she is still nervous in public spaces, preferring to meet in a rented private study rather than a cafe. “I’m worried I might get it again,” Jeon says.</p><p>Jeon Woo-oak的表情麻木，紧张，使某人在公众视线中感到悲伤。自Covid-19康复以来已经有几个月了，但她仍然在公共场所感到紧张，她更愿意在租来的私人书房见面，而不是在咖啡馆见面。 Jeon说：“我担心我可能会再次得到它。”</p><p> In late May, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus swept through a warehouse owned by the e-commerce company Coupang in Bucheon, South Korea, where Jeon, 45, worked. Jeon caught the virus and brought it home to her 23-year-old daughter and husband. She asked for their names not to be published, to protect their privacy.</p><p> 5月下旬，这种新型冠状病毒爆发，扫过了韩国富川市电子商务公司Coupang拥有的一个仓库，现年45岁的Jeon曾在该仓库工作。 Jeon感染了该病毒，并将其带回家给她23岁的女儿和丈夫。她要求不要公开他们的名字，以保护他们的隐私。</p><p> After their diagnoses, the three shared a room at the Incheon Medical Center. They spent the first few days keeping each other in good spirits, discussing what to eat when they got out. But without warning, the infection spread to Jeon’s husband’s lungs, where the damage it inflicted appeared in X-rays as ghostly white blots. At around noon on June 7, her husband video-called from the intensive care unit, assuring Jeon that he was fine. About four hours later, he suffered cardiac arrest, then fell into a coma.</p><p> 经诊断，三人在仁川医疗中心共用一个房间。他们花了头几天彼此保持良好的情绪，讨论了出去后该吃些什么。但是这种感染没有事先警告，就传播到全田的丈夫的肺部，在那里造成的损害在X射线中以幽灵般的白色斑点出现。 6月7日中午左右，她的丈夫从重症监护室给他打了视频电话，向Jeon保证他很好。大约四个小时后，他心脏骤停，然后陷入昏迷。</p><p> “He’s been unconscious for three months, but he’s not going to get any better at this point, so I have to move him to a long-term care facility this weekend,” says Jeon. “But they can only manage his condition there. If he develops pneumonia again, I’ll have to move him back to the hospital.”</p><p> Jeon说：“他已经昏迷了三个月，但是此时他并不会好转，所以我必须在这个周末将他转移到一家长期护理机构。” “但是他们只能在那里管理他的病情。如果他再次出现肺炎，我将不得不将他送回医院。”</p><p> Jeon began working at Coupang, the biggest player in South Korea’s e-commerce market, in April. At the time, the Bucheon facility — a  six-story refrigerator where fresh food products are stored and packaged for delivery to the surrounding greater Seoul area — was one of the few places hiring. Jeon’s husband had been furloughed, and the family was struggling to make ends meet, so she signed a three-month contract.</p><p> Jeon于4月开始在Coupang（韩国电子商务市场的最大参与者）工作。当时，富川工厂是一台六层楼的冰箱，用于存放新鲜食品并包装好，然后运往更大的首尔周边地区，这是少数几个招聘场所之一。 Jeon的丈夫已经休假，全家都在努力维持生计，因此她签署了三个月的合同。</p><p> On  the morning of May 24, authorities reportedly called Coupang to notify them that a Covid-19 case had been traced back to its Bucheon warehouse. Work was suspended for three hours while the facility was disinfected. When Jeon came in later that afternoon, at 5 p.m., shift managers had already made the announcement to the hundreds of workers packed into the narrow foyer. When Jeon and her colleagues asked where in the facility the infections had been traced to, they were rebuffed. “Then they told the rest of us to go to our workstations, saying we were safe,” she says.</p><p>据报道，5月24日上午，当局打电话给Coupang，通知他们Covid-19案已追溯至其富川仓库。设施消毒后，工作暂停了三个小时。当Jeon下午下午5点钟进来时，轮班经理已经向挤在狭窄门厅的数百名工人宣布了这一消息。当Jeon和她的同事问到感染源在哪里时，他们被拒绝了。她说：“然后他们告诉我们其他人去我们的工作站，说我们很安全。”</p><p> Even before the outbreak, the risks of working in a windowless warehouse, where everyone breathed the same stale air, had been obvious. “We would always tell each other, ‘When it happens here, it’s going to be a complete disaster. We are all going to die,’” recalls Jeon.</p><p> 甚至在爆发之前，在无窗仓库工作的风险是显而易见的，每个人都呼吸同样的空气。 “我们总是会互相告诉对方，‘当这里发生时，将是一场彻底的灾难。我们都快要死了。”简恩回忆说。</p><p> She took every possible precaution, using her car instead of the employee shuttle and the stairs instead of the elevator. During her shift, she wore a mask and gloves. Not wanting to wait in the long line for the cafeteria, where people would eat crammed together with their faces uncovered, she skipped dinner. It wasn’t enough. The Bucheon warehouse carried on as usual, until the evening of May 25, almost two full working days after officials were warned of a possible outbreak. Jeon tested positive on May 26. In total,  there were 152 Covid-19 cases traced to the warehouse: 84 employees, as well as 68 others infected from subsequent contact.</p><p> 她采取一切可能的预防措施，使用汽车代替员工班车，使用楼梯代替电梯。在轮班期间，她戴着口罩和手套。她不想在排队等候的自助餐厅里等待，因为那里的人们会挤满他们的食物，而他们的脸却露出来，她不吃晚餐。这还不够。富川市的仓库照常营业，直到5月25日晚上，在警告官员可能爆发之后，整整两个工作日。 Jeon于5月26日测试呈阳性。总共有152例Covid-19病例被追踪到仓库：84名员工，以及68名其他因随后的接触而感染的人。</p><p> Jeon holds the company responsible for failing to take the necessary precautions to prevent the outbreak. “I’ve told Coupang that my husband is extremely ill, and that I want both a sincere apology and compensation,” she says.</p><p> Jeon对未能采取必要的预防措施以防止疾病爆发负责。她说：“我已经告诉库班，我丈夫病得很重，我要真诚的道歉和补偿。”</p><p>    Coupang’s apparent mishandling of the outbreak at Bucheon is embarrassing for a company that styles itself as a socially conscious innovator, one that offered delivery workers secure, full-time jobs while revolutionizing Korea’s e-commerce industry, the fifth largest in the world. But to stay ahead of its rivals, the company has driven its employees harder and harder, trying to win by turning around orders faster than anyone else. This year, at least two workers have died — in March,  a Coupang delivery man was found dead on the steps of a residence where he had been delivering packages, and in May,  a worker, in their 40s, at another Coupang warehouse died after collapsing in a bathroom. Warehouse workers and delivery drivers describe these deaths as the inevitable outcome of a business ethic that prioritizes rapid delivery over employee safety.</p><p>    Coupang对富川疫情的明显误解令这家公司定位为具有社会意识的创新者，这令人尴尬。该公司在为世界第五大的韩国电子商务产业带来革命性变革的同时，为送货员提供了安全的全职工作。但是为了保持领先地位，该公司越来越努力地推动员工发展，试图通过比其他任何人更快地处理订单来赢得胜利。今年，至少有两名工人死亡-3月份，一名库班快递员在他寄送包裹的住所的台阶上被发现死亡，5月份，另一名库班公司40多岁的工人死于库班在浴室里倒塌。仓库工人和送货司机将这些死亡描述为商业道德的必然结果，这种商业道德将快速送货置于员工安全之上。</p><p> “Even before [the Bucheon outbreak], I’d been struck by how the company seems to treat workplace injuries as a given and what I’ve perceived to be a deep-rooted and widespread problem of neglecting worker safety,” says labor researcher Jang Kwi-yeon, who has studied working conditions at Coupang. “Coupang has grown tremendously in the span of just a few years, and the intensity of work just keeps on increasing.”</p><p>劳工研究人员说：“甚至在[富川爆发]之前，我就对公司如何将工伤视为既定做法以及被我认为是根深蒂固且普遍存在的忽视工人安全的问题感到震惊”，张国妍，曾在Coupang研究过工作条件。 “ Coupang在短短几年间就取得了巨大的发展，而且工作强度还在不断增加。”</p><p> When Covid-19 struck, and homebound consumers turned in unprecedented numbers to e-commerce, the pressure worsened, and more workers were put in harm’s way. As another former Bucheon worker told  Rest of World: “What was bound to happen has happened.”</p><p> 当Covid-19罢工，而居家的消费者将前所未有的人数转向电子商务时，压力加剧了，更多的工人受到了伤害。正如另一位富川前工人告诉世界其他地区：“必然发生的事情已经发生了。”</p><p>      Coupang — a portmanteau of  coupon and the sound of one going off:  pang! — was launched in August 2010 by Kim Beom-seok, a Korean American in his early 30s, as a daily-deals “social commerce” venture modeled on Groupon. Launched with backing from  Clayton Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation Fund, it was turning a modest profit by 2012, when Kim — who goes by “Bom Kim” in English — decided to take the company public on the Nasdaq.</p><p>      Coupang-优惠券的Portmanteau和一个关闭的声音：砰！ —由30多岁的韩裔美国人金本硕（Kim Beom-seok）于2010年8月创立，该公司是模仿Groupon的日常交易“社交商务”企业。在克莱顿·克里斯滕森（Clayton Christensen）的颠覆性创新基金（Disruptive Innovation Fund）的支持下成立的该基金到2012年实现了微利，当时金（英语为“ Bom Kim”）决定在纳斯达克上市。</p><p> The weekend before the listing was due, Bom Kim pulled the plug. His vision, he had said in numerous interviews, was to create something that left customers saying, “How did I ever live without Coupang?” — and his company wasn’t that. From then on, the company would model itself not on Groupon, but on Amazon.</p><p> 上市到期前的一个周末，Bom Kim拔掉了电话。他在无数次采访中都曾说过，他的愿景是创造出一种让顾客流连忘返的东西：“我怎么没有Coupang住？” -那不是他的公司。从那时起，该公司将不再以Groupon为模型，而是以亚马逊为模型。</p><p> By 2015, Coupang had built something that surpassed even Amazon: a long, unbroken supply chain, whereby products moved seamlessly from warehouse to driver to customer, with 99% of orders delivered within 24 hours, all year and 7 days a week. (Amazon has since made a similar delivery network.) In 2016, Coupang was  named one of the 50 Smartest Companies by  MIT Technology Review. The same year, Bom Kim appeared on  Forbes’ “Global Game Changers” list with the tagline “beating Jeff Bezos at his own game.”</p><p> 到2015年，Coupang建立了甚至超越亚马逊的产品：漫长而完整的供应链，产品从仓库到司机再到客户无缝地转移，全年和每周7天的24小时内交付的订单达99％。 （亚马逊从此建立了类似的交付网络。）2016年，Coupang被《麻省理工学院技术评论》（MIT Technology Review）评选为“最聪明的50家公司”之一。同年，Bom Kim凭借“击败自己的游戏击败Jeff Bezos”的口号出现在福布斯的“全球游戏规则改变者”列表中。</p><p> Like Bezos, Bom Kim had rightly predicted that faster and “frictionless” delivery — not just competitive pricing and wide selections — would be the future of e-commerce. And with its dense, smartphone-friendly urban populations, South Korea was close to a perfect market. At the time, a slate of third-party marketplaces and Groupon imitators made up most of the country’s e-commerce sector.</p><p>与Bezos一样，Bom Kim正确地预测，更快，更“无摩擦”的交付-不仅仅是具有竞争力的价格和广泛的选择-将会是电子商务的未来。韩国拥有密集的，适合智能手机的城市人口，因此接近一个完美的市场。当时，大量的第三方市场和Groupon模仿者构成了该国大部分的电子商务部门。</p><p> “In modeling itself after Amazon by investing aggressively in its own logistical infrastructure, Coupang swooped in and set an entirely new standard for e-commerce [in South Korea],” says Im Il, a professor at the Yonsei University School of Business in Seoul. “It eventually sparked both a price war and a delivery war across the entire market.”</p><p> 首尔延世大学商学院教授Im Il表示：“在模仿亚马逊后，通过大力投资自身的物流基础设施，Coupang进军并为[韩国]设定了电子商务的全新标准。” 。 “最终，这引发了整个市场的价格战和交付战。”</p><p> E-commerce in South Korea was dogged by a challenge common to online retail around the world. So-called last-mile delivery — the stretch of the delivery process in which the package moves from hub to consumer — was expensive, time-consuming, and unreliable when handled by third-party shipping companies. Late, damaged, or lost packages were immensely consequential to customer satisfaction but nearly always out of a retailer’s control.</p><p> 韩国的电子商务受到世界范围内在线零售共同挑战的困扰。所谓的“最后一英里”交付（即包裹从集散中心转移到消费者的整个交付过程）是昂贵，费时且不可靠的，由第三方运输公司处理。延迟，损坏或丢失的包装极大地影响了客户的满意度，但几乎总是不受零售商控制。</p><p> Logistics,  Bom Kim believed, was “a fight of minutes and seconds.” In 2013, Coupang acquired the data-analytics company CalmSea and began to deploy artificial intelligence to pare down delivery times. Machine learning helps the company predict consumption patterns and position stock so that it is closest to likely buyers. In its warehouses, Coupang uses the same “random-stow” system as Amazon, in which algorithms tell stockers where to store items based on purchasing patterns, rather than on category. On deliveries, artificial intelligence software plots optimal routes for drivers and tells them where and how to stack packages in the truck.</p><p> 宝金（Bom Kim）认为，物流是“一场分秒必争的战斗”。 2013年，Coupang收购了数据分析公司CalmSea，并开始部署人工智能以减少交付时间。机器学习可帮助公司预测消费模式和库存状况，使其最接近可能的购买者。在其仓库中，Coupang使用了与亚马逊相同的“随机存放”系统，该系统中的算法根据购买方式（而不是类别）告诉库存商将物品存放在何处。在交货时，人工智能软件会为驾驶员绘制最佳路线，并告诉他们卡车在何处以及如何堆叠包裹。</p><p> To cement Coupang’s control over the last mile, Bom Kim did something that few others in the industry wanted to: he hired his own drivers.</p><p> 为了巩固Coupang在最后一英里的控制权，Bom Kim做了一些业内其他人想做的事情：他雇了自己的司机。</p><p> In March 2014, the company launched what has since become its crowning achievement, Rocket Delivery,  starting with 50 “Coupang Men” — full-time drivers in branded trucks — who guaranteed next-day delivery of packages, which the company calls “gifts.”</p><p>2014年3月，该公司推出了后来成为其最高成就的Rocket Delivery，从50名“ Coupang Men”（品牌卡车的专职司机）开始，他们保证第二天将包裹交付，该公司称之为“礼物”。 ”</p><p> Referred to internally as “spreaders of happiness,” Coupang Men were the spiritual ambassadors of the company. To win over female customers in their 20s and 30s — a key demographic — Coupang Men handed out flowers and handwritten cards, snapped photos of packages to confirm delivery, and would know not to ring the doorbell at homes with babies.</p><p> 在内部被称为“幸福的传播者”，Coupang Men是公司的精神大使。为了赢得20岁至30岁这一关键人群中的女性顾客，Coupang Men分发了鲜花和手写卡，拍下了包裹的照片以确认交货，并且不知道不要在有婴儿的家庭中敲门铃。</p><p> Bom Kim called them “ the weapon that Amazon doesn’t have.” And unlike local shipping companies, which hired fleets of drivers on precarious temp contracts, Coupang Men were given a fair wage, full insurance coverage, annual health checkups, 15 vacation days a year, and company trucks and gas.</p><p> Bom Kim称他们为“亚马逊没有的武器。”与当地的船运公司不同，后者以不稳定的临时合同雇用了车队的司机，而库珀人则获得了合理的工资，全额保险，年度健康检查，每年15个休假日以及公司的卡车和汽油。</p><p> More importantly, the company offered drivers the opportunity to become “regular” employees in a line of work where this was virtually unheard of. (In South Korea, employees are divided into “regular” and “irregular” labor, with only the former receiving comprehensive legal protection.)</p><p> 更重要的是，该公司为驾驶员提供了机会，使他们在几乎闻所未闻的工作中成为“正式”员工。 （在韩国，员工分为“常规”和“非常规”劳动，只有前者受到全面的法律保护。）</p><p>   To execute this vision, Bom Kim courted talent from his competitors — including Amazon — who recognized in Coupang a similar, single-minded zeal. “I was very impressed with the strategy and control of the last mile,” Darrin Shamo, who left Amazon-owned shoe retailer Zappos to become Coupang’s chief marketing officer in 2015, told  Rest of World. “There [was] an equally maniacal focus on the customer experience. Both [Amazon and Coupang] obsess over millisecond improvements in page-load times, breakneck delivery times, vast selection, and customer empowerment.” Shamo left Coupang in 2016 and later joined the U.S. food-delivery company DoorDash.</p><p>   为了实现这一愿景，Bom Kim向竞争对手（包括亚马逊）征求了人才，他们在Coupang中认可了类似的，专一的热情。 “最后一英里的战略和控制力给我留下了深刻的印象，”达林·沙莫（Darrin Shamo）对世界其他地区说，他于2015年离开亚马逊所有的鞋类零售商Zappos成为Coupang的首席营销官。 “客户体验同样受到关注。 [Amazon和Coupang]都在页面加载时间，突破性的交付时间，广泛的选择和增强客户能力方面都追求毫秒级的改进。 Shamo于2016年离开Coupang，后来加入了美国食品外卖公司DoorDash。</p><p> Big name investors got behind Kim’s vision. In late 2014, less than a year after launching Rocket Delivery, Coupang raised $300 million in a financing round led by BlackRock. In June 2015, SoftBank pledged to put down $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation. SoftBank’s  Vision Fund followed up with another $2 billion in  2018, this time valuing Coupang at $9 billion. Since 2010, the company has raised an estimated $3.8 billion,  according to investment database CB Insights.</p><p>大牌投资者落后于金正日的愿景。 2014年下半年，即推出Rocket Delivery不到一年，Coupang在由贝莱德（BlackRock）领投的一轮融资中筹集了3亿美元。 2015年6月，软银承诺以50亿美元的估值注资10亿美元。软银的愿景基金在2018年又追加了20亿美元的投资，这次对Coupang的估值为90亿美元。根据投资数据库CB Insights的数据，自2010年以来，该公司估计已筹集了38亿美元。</p><p> These massive cash injections have allowed Coupang to pursue a growth strategy known as  blitzscaling. The approach, applied by splashy disruptors such as Uber and WeWork — both backed by SoftBank — rests on the idea that scaling a novel service in an untapped market as quickly as possible lets a company secure an early advantage and outrun competition. Often, this has meant operating at a substantial loss and burning through investors’ money to win market share. The viability of blitzscaling has been tested over the past couple of years. WeWork’s IPO had to be pulled after investors questioned whether it could ever turn its market position into profit. Uber has disappointed since its listing in 2019 and  lost $8.5 billion last year.</p><p> 这些巨额现金注入使Coupang得以采用一种称为“闪电扩展”的增长策略。由软银支持的Uber和WeWork等颠覆性颠覆者采用的方法是基于这样的想法，即尽快在尚未开发的市场中扩展新服务，从而使公司获得早期优势并超越竞争。通常，这意味着大量亏损，消耗投资者的钱来赢得市场份额。在过去的几年中已经测试了快速缩放的可行性。在投资者质疑WeWork是否可以将其市场地位转化为利润之后，WeWork的IPO不得不取消。自2019年上市以来，Uber一直感到失望，去年亏损了85亿美元。</p><p> SoftBank’s lavish investments have helped Coupang on its way to becoming the market leader in South Korean e-commerce.  Half of South Korea’s population of 51 million  has downloaded the company’s app. Its Rocket Delivery Habitat — a vast latticework of logistics outposts — is so comprehensive that  nearly 70% of South Koreans  live within 10 minutes of a Coupang hub. The company has branched out into food delivery and fresh groceries and, in 2018, began offering “Dawn Delivery,” which guarantees that any one of Coupang’s  two million unique items will be at your door by 7 a.m. if the order is placed by midnight the previous day. Bom Kim is now South Korea’s second-youngest billionaire.</p><p> 软银的大量投资帮助Coupang成为了韩国电子商务的市场领导者。韩国5100万人口中有一半下载了该公司的应用程序。它的“火箭交付栖息地”（一个庞大的后勤基地）非常全面，以至于将近70％的韩国人居住在库邦枢纽的10分钟内。该公司已涉足食品外卖和新鲜食品杂货市场，并于2018年开始提供“黎明外卖”服务，该服务可确保如果Coupang的200万个独特商品中的任何一个在午夜12点前到达您的家，前一天。 Bom Kim现在是韩国第二年轻的亿万富翁。</p><p> This has come at a price. Although Coupang’s annual revenue has grown exponentially, reaching $5.9 billion in 2019 —  a 64% increase from 2018 — the company hasn’t turned a profit in years. Payroll costs have  increased fourteenfold since 2014, and the company recorded more than $1 billion in operating losses in  2018 and $593 million in  2019.</p><p> 这是有代价的。尽管Coupang的年收入成倍增长，但在2019年达到了59亿美元，比2018年增长了64％，但该公司多年来未实现盈利。自2014年以来，薪资成本增加了14倍，该公司2018年的运营亏损超过10亿美元，2019年的运营亏损超过5.93亿美元。</p><p> “I’m still skeptical whether Coupang can even make up its losses and become profitable at this point,” says Im, the business school professor. “It’s true that they’ve secured a sizable share of the market through their aggressive logistical expansion, but under their current model, this increased share will just lead to a proportional increase in losses.” Coupang, in his view, has dug itself into a hole: By dragging down prices to capture consumer loyalty, it has left little room to actually make money. “They can’t suddenly raise their prices now,” says Im. “But their operating costs can’t get any lower either.”</p><p> 商学院教授Im表示：“目前，我仍然对Coupang是否能弥补损失并实现盈利表示怀疑。” “的确，他们通过积极的物流扩张赢得了相当大的市场份额，但是在他们目前的模式下，份额的增加只会导致损失成比例的增加。”他认为，Coupang已陷入困境：通过降低价格以吸引消费者的忠诚度，Coupang几乎没有赚钱的余地。林说：“他们现在不能突然提高价格。” “但是他们的运营成本也无法降低。”</p><p> The toll of this rapid growth is not only financial. The pace of expansion and the demand for maximum speed and efficiency have placed an enormous burden on the people who work fulfilling Coupang’s orders.</p><p>这种快速增长的代价不仅是财务方面的损失。扩张的步伐以及对最大速度和效率的需求给履行Coupang订单的工作人员带来了巨大负担。</p><p>    Around 11 a.m. on September 8, Tae-il, a Coupang Man in his 40s who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution from the company, rolled up in his white one-ton Coupang truck outside an apartment building in Gimpo, a satellite city of Seoul, about an hour’s drive north of Bucheon. These high-rise suburbs have sprouted up all around the overpopulated capital. The apartments embody the same sort of one-stop-shop convenience that has defined Coupang: Amid groves of red pines, there is a senior center, a “mom Center,” a daycare, a library, a nature museum. Everything has a slightly unsettling new sheen.</p><p>    9月8日上午11点左右，一名40岁的Coupang男子Tae-il由于担心公司的举报而要求匿名，他用白色的一吨重Coupang卡车在金浦市一座卫星公寓楼外卷起。首尔，距离富川以北约一个小时的车程。这些高层郊区遍布人口过剩的首都。这些公寓体现了库珀定义的一站式便利：在红松树林中，有一个高级中心，一个“妈妈中心”，一个日托中心，一个图书馆，一个自然博物馆。一切都有新的光泽。</p><p> Tae-il, who is stocky with shaggy hair, is wearing his Coupang polo and navy-blue wraps on his arms and knees. He has just picked up the 300 or so packages he will be delivering today from the nearby delivery camp. These apartments are his first stop.</p><p> Tae-il矮胖的头发，蓬松的头发，手臂和膝盖上穿着Coupang马球衫和海军蓝色包裹。他刚从附近的派送营收拾了今天将要送达的300个左右的包裹。这些公寓是他的第一站。</p><p> “I have 180 homes today,” he says by way of greeting. His truck is one of the newer models, which supposedly eliminate dead space with sliding side doors that open into three horizontal shelves. The truck is packed to the brim, with boxes squeezed into even the passenger seat. When Tae-il yanks the sliding door open, an avalanche of stuff spills out. Asked how the AI system that orchestrates the loading process works, he answers with an exasperated laugh: “AI? It’s humans that do this work.”</p><p> “我今天有180所房屋，”他问候说。他的卡车是较新的车型之一，据称它可以通过滑动侧门打开三个水平架子来消除死角。卡车装满了边缘，箱子被挤进了乘客座位。当泰伊拉扯推拉门打开时，大量的东西溢出了。当被问及协调加载过程的AI系统如何工作时，他笑着回答：“ AI？这是人类的工作。”</p><p> Before running into each block with a cartload of packages — which today include boxes of ramen, coffee, lots of bottles of water and toilet paper, a foam roller, an air fryer, and countless mysterious Rocket Delivery boxes — he consults his work smartphone, on which an app displays the order of each delivery and flags any refunds. He has a well-tested method: At each floor, Tae-il runs out and deposits the packages at the door, snaps a verification photo while walking backward into the elevator, and punches it into the app. By 12:30 p.m., he’s hit 37 homes and is lightly panting.</p><p> 在带着一包包装进入每个街区之前，他先咨询了他的工作智能手机，其中包括包装的拉面，咖啡，许多瓶水和卫生纸，泡沫辊，空气炸锅以及无数神秘的Rocket Delivery盒子，应用程序会在该应用程序上显示每次交货的顺序并标记所有退款。他有一个经过充分测试的方法：在每层楼，泰伊（Tae-il）用尽并在门口存放包裹，在向后走入电梯的过程中拍摄验证照片，然后将其打入应用程序。到下午12:30，他已经打了37座房屋，并且喘着粗气。</p><p> Before becoming a Coupang Man two years ago, Tae-il was an educator.(Coupang recently changed the term  Coupang Man to the more inclusive “ Cou-chin,” a portmanteau of Coupang and the Korean word for “friend.”) Although the company likes to advertise delivery jobs as long-term careers for young men, in reality, says Tae-il, it has become a landing spot for down-and-out men in their 40s and 50s. “There are lots of people who signed up after their businesses failed.”</p><p>在两年前成为一名Coupang Man之前，Tae-il是一名教育家。（Coupang最近将Coupang Man一词更改为更具包容性的“ Cou-chin”，这是Coupang的写照，在朝鲜语中是“ friend”。） Tae-il说，该公司喜欢宣传送货工作作为年轻人的长期职业，实际上，它已经成为40多岁和50多岁的沉浮男子的着陆点。 “有很多人在业务失败后签约。”</p><p> Far from the idealized image of the Coupang Man as a “spreader of happiness,” Tae-il, who works 52 hours, five days a week, has a beleaguered air about him. When asked why he’s not writing any personalized letters or dropping off candy, Tae-il sneers. “Not a single person does that anymore. If you do, you get called an idiot. And you will probably get written up for not making deliveries,” he says.</p><p> 泰伊（Tae-il）每周工作五天，每天工作52个小时，这与Coupang Man的理想化形象相去甚远，而Tae-il却对他充满了困惑。当被问及为什么他不写任何个性化的信件或丢掉糖果时，泰伊笑了。 “不再有一个人这样做。如果这样做，您会被称为白痴。而且您可能会因为没有交货而被写下来，”他说。</p><p>  Since the early days of Rocket Shipping, delivery loads and deadline pressures have steadily increased, and the pandemic has ratcheted things up even further. According to data  compiled by the Coupang drivers’ union, average individual delivery loads increased from 57 packages a day in 2015 to 242 in August of 2019. By February 2020, near the peak of the pandemic in South Korea, it had risen to 340.</p><p>  自从Rocket Shipping成立以来，交付量和截止期限压力一直在稳步增加，大流行病进一步加剧了这种情况。根据Coupang司机工会收集的数据，平均个人交付量从2015年的每天57个包裹增加到2019年8月的242个包裹。到2020年2月，在韩国大流行高峰时，它已上升到340个。</p><p> Despite the growing delivery volumes, Tae-il says that wages have effectively dropped or stagnated, partly because the company  has recently stratified Coupang Men into “levels.” Rookie drivers are now automatically assigned to the “light” level, where they are paid minimum wage and assigned 75% of “normal” drivers’ loads, until they can prove their capacity to do more work. New drivers begin on irregular contracts and are eligible to turn regular only after a minimum of two years with the company. Coupang says that this system was introduced to give drivers the freedom to decide how much they work, but in reality, says Tae-il, the rising individual workload has simply turned “lights” into a less secure, minimum-wage version of what “normals” used to be. Although Coupang likes to point out that “over 90%” of drivers who have met the two-year eligibility requirement transition to regular contracts, Tae-il says  this is because over 90% of drivers quit within a year, according to the union’s data. “Anyone in their right mind ends up quitting,” he says. “The ones who stay and tough it out do it because they have no choice.”</p><p> 尽管交付量不断增长，但Tae-il表示，工资实际上已经下降或停滞，部分原因是该公司最近将Coupang Men划分为多个“级别”。现在，新秀驾驶员会自动分配到“轻便”级别，在该级别中，他们会获得最低工资，并分配“正常”驾驶员负担的75％，直到他们能够证明自己有能力做更多的工作。新司机以不定期的合同开始，只有在公司工作至少两年后才有资格转为常规司机。 Coupang说，引入此系统是为了让驾驶员自由决定他们的工作量，但实际上，Tae-il说，不断增加的个人工作量只是将“信号灯”变成了“安全性”最低，工资最低的版本。常态”。尽管Coupang喜欢指出，已经满足两年资格要求的“超过90％”的驾驶员已转变为常规合同，但Tae-il表示，这是因为根据工会的数据，有90％的驾驶员会在一年内辞职。他说：“任何有头脑的人最终都会辞职。” “那些坚持不懈地坚持下去的人之所以这样做，是因为他们别无选择。”</p><p> The pressure of performance-based promotion and incentives means that drivers feel constantly under the gun. This, Tae-il says, has led to accidents, like drivers tumbling down the stairs or getting into traffic collisions between routes, but many are reluctant to call in sick for fear of being  denied contract extensions.</p><p> 基于绩效的促销和激励措施带来的压力意味着驾驶员不断感到不安。泰伊（Tae-il）说，这导致了事故的发生，例如驾驶员跌下楼梯或在路线之间发生交通冲突，但许多人因担心无法续签合同而不愿病假。</p><p> In March, a Cou-chin in his mid-40s, publicly known by only his surname, Kim, was found dead by a colleague on the steps of a residence in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, after Kim’s supervisor noticed that his progress tracker had gone cold. An autopsy later showed that he had suffered a heart attack. Coupang claimed that as a “light” deliveryman, with fewer than three weeks on the job, he was only carrying around half the standard load. The union countered that that was still an “absurd” amount for a rookie.</p><p>3月，在金正日的主管注意到他的进度追踪器已经走了之后，一位同事发现一名40岁中期的下巴人在京畿道安山市的住所台阶上被同事杀死。冷。后来的尸检表明他患有心脏病。 Coupang声称，作为一名“轻型”送货员，工作时间不到三周，他只能承担大约一半的标准负荷。工会反驳说，对于新秀来说，这仍然是“荒谬”的数目。</p><p> Since his death, the company has been reminding drivers to take their one-hour breaks, but Tae-il bets that most of his coworkers will still be working through them. “If they want us to rest, they should assign us loads that actually leave us enough time for it,” he says over lunch at a convenience store. “It’s true that Coupang is a technology company on the outside. But underneath it all are masses of workers like an army of ants.”</p><p> 自从他去世以来，公司一直在提醒驾驶员要休息一小时，但泰伊打赌他的大多数同事仍将通过他们工作。他在一家便利店吃午饭时说：“如果他们要我们休息，就应该给我们分配负荷，这实际上给我们留出了足够的时间。” “ Coupang确实是一家外部技术公司。但在这一切之下，都是一群工人，就像一群蚂蚁。”</p><p>    Critics of Coupang draw a direct line between the company’s philosophy of speed at any cost and the outbreak at Bucheon.</p><p>    Coupang的批评者在该公司不惜一切代价的速度理念与富川爆发之间直截了当。</p><p> When Jeon Woo-oak started working at the distribution center on April 28th, she was struck by the place’s near-martial atmosphere and pace. There, from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m., she stood by an industrial conveyor rail on the second floor, packing items, including watermelons and eggs, into boxes that would then be overnighted to their destinations. To stay warm in the chilled air, she wore her long padded parka. On her way home, she saw Coupang Men hurrying to make deliveries by the 7 a.m. delivery deadline.</p><p> Jeon Woo-oak于4月28日开始在配送中心工作时，她对该地点近乎军火的气氛和步伐感到震惊。那里，从下午5点开始凌晨2点至凌晨2点，她站在二楼的工业传送带旁，将包括西瓜和鸡蛋在内的物品装进箱子，然后隔夜送到目的地。为了在寒冷的空气中保持温暖，她穿着她的长棉质派克大衣。在回家的路上，她看到Coupang Men赶在早上7点交货期限前交货。</p><p> Outside of the hour-long meal break, “there wasn’t even a second or minute to rest during the day,” she recalls. “After one ten-day stretch, every part of my body was swollen — arms, legs, fingers.”</p><p> 她回忆说，在长达一个小时的用餐休息时间之外，“白天甚至没有一秒钟或一分钟的休息时间。” “经过十天的伸展运动，我身体的每个部位都肿胀了-胳膊，腿，手指。”</p><p> After Coupang added same-day fresh-food delivery in late April, things became even more frenetic. “From 30 minutes to an hour before each deadline, it was just complete chaos,” Go Geon, a former Bucheon employee who worked the sam</p><p>在Coupang在4月下旬增加当日新鲜食品交付后，事情变得更加疯狂。 “在每个截止日期之前的30分钟到一个小时，这简直是一片混乱，”曾担任富山集团员工的富川前员工Go Geon</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/">https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/置于/">#置于</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warehouse/">#warehouse</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/coupang/">#coupang</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
