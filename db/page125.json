", "note_en": "Hundreds of years ago, people developed ingenious methods to secure their letters from prying eyes \u2013 and they did it with only paper, adhesive and folds.\n Late at night on 8 February 1587, an imprisoned Mary Queen of Scots composed her  last ever letter to her brother-in-law. &#34;Tonight, after dinner, I have been advised of my sentence: I am to be executed like a criminal at eight in the morning,&#34; she wrote. &#34;The Catholic faith and the assertion of my God-given right to the English crown are the two issues on which I am condemned.&#34; With a sad acceptance of her fate, she asked him to take care of her affairs and pay her servants, wishing him &#34;good health and a long and happy life&#34;.\n After Mary had finished writing, she then began to fold up the letter to secure its contents. She didn&#39;t want her captors snooping \u2013 and particularly not her cousin Queen Elizabeth I. However, envelopes were not used in the 1500s \u2013 not least because paper was expensive \u2013 and there was no trustworthy postal service at the time.\n Instead, Mary cut a thin strip from the paper margin, before folding up her message into a small rectangle. After poking the knife through the rectangle to make a hole, she then fed the strip through, looping it and tightening it a few times, creating a &#34;spiral lock&#34;. No wax or adhesive was required, but crucially, if someone tried to sneak a look, they would have to rip through the strip, so her brother-in-law would know the message had been intercepted.\n  Mary Queen of Scots was far from the only person who was skilled in the art of &#34;letterlocking&#34; \u2013 the technique became common throughout Europe during the Late Middle Ages (1250-1500) and Early Modern periods (1500-1815). By folding and cutting letters in various clever patterns, people attempted to hide their correspondence from unwanted readers, and the &#34;locks&#34; came in myriad types.\n &#34;This isn&#39;t something special that people do on special occasions. This is how you send a letter before the envelope is invented,&#34; explains Daniel Starza Smith, a lecturer in Early Modern English literature at King\u2019s College London. &#34;So, if it&#39;s a business letter, if it&#39;s a love letter, if it&#39;s a spy letter, if it&#39;s a diplomatic letter, they&#39;re all using letterlocking. So it&#39;s not something confined to experts, royalty or spy masters. Anyone who is capable of sending a letter is using letterlocking.&#34;\n But in the present day, we&#39;re only beginning to understand the technique&#39;s importance in history. In recent years, a whole taxonomy of apparently forgotten letterlocking tricks have been uncovered.\n    The  modern study of letterlocking began when the conservator Jana Dambrogio was leafing through a cache of documents in the Vatican Secret Archives in Italy. In the early 2000s, she had been the first woman from outside the archive&#39;s conservation laboratory who was allowed to work there. On her first day, she was offered the chance to work on the  Fondo Veneto Sezione II, a cache of maps, letters, legal and accounting documents from the late 1500s, many of which had not been repaired.\n As she completed her conservation work, Dambrogio didn&#39;t always follow the writing, since it was often in old Italian dialects, but she did notice cuts, creases and folds in the paper. While it could be mistaken for damage to the untrained eye, she realised it was evidence of letterlocking. So, she methodically described what she observed.\n  When Dambrogio returned to the US \u2013 she&#39;s now based at MIT in Massachusetts \u2013 those notes and models of the original documents would come in useful. &#34;There are probably thousands of letters of the Vatican, but this handful that I modelled started to help us build the language of letterlocking,&#34; she explains.\n After connecting with Starza Smith, she and her colleagues began to seek out more examples of letterlocking wherever they could find them, often hidden away in old archives and museum collections.\n A few years ago, they came across one particularly rich bounty: a whole trunk full of 2,600 letters from 17th-Century Europe which had gone undelivered \u2013 577 of which were unopened.\n  The collection had been kept by a married postmaster and postmistress called Simon Brienne and Marie Germain, who lived in the Netherlands. In the 1600s, the recipients of letters had to pay to receive them, so for various reasons \u2013 poverty, relocation or death \u2013 letters often failed to reach their destination. Many had the words &#34; niet hebben&#34; scribbled on them in Dutch, which means\u00a0&#34;refused&#34;. The couple and their employees kept them in the hope that recipients might eventually shell out, hence the trunk&#39;s nickname: \u201cthe piggy bank\u201d ( spaarpotje). Inadvertently, they had compiled one of the richest epistolary archives of the period.\n Many of the letters were everyday correspondence, but collectively they paint a detailed picture of life in Europe during the 1600s. &#34;The letters represent the thoughts, cares, and dreams of a cross-section of society: there are missives by ambassadors, dukes and duchesses, merchants, publishers, and spies, but also by actors and musicians, ordinary lovers, struggling refugees, and by women as well as men,&#34; write the researchers who have been  studying the collection.\n  Along with various other sources they found, the Brienne Collection has allowed Dambrogio and Starza Smith to identify a range of letterlocking techniques known to people during the Early Modern Age.\n Over time, the pair have compiled what is essentially a  &#34;periodic table&#34; of letterlocking. This includes at least 18 different formats, ranging from the simplest of locks \u2013 a rolled scroll sealed with wax \u2013 to a packet which has 12 edges once sealed. They also describe attributes such as whether they feature slits or tucks, as well as rating the security of locks, according to how tamper-resistant they would have been. While it might have been possible for a determined snooper to reinstate some locks undetected, the difficulty of doing so varied \u2013 in some cases, they&#39;d have no choice but to rip a strip of paper, or visibly break the adhesive.\n  I had a go at locking a letter myself recently in a workshop that the pair organised at MIT, making a &#34;triangle lock&#34;. This particular one wasn&#39;t found in the Brienne Collection, but was a technique used from the 1400s to the 1700s across Europe and England.\n It was surprisingly complex, and I was struck by the ingenuity of the process. We started with an A4 sheet of paper and some tape, with Dambrogio leading us through the steps: &#34;cut off a triangle from the bottom\u2026 fold short edge to short edge\u2026don&#39;t make a sharp crease, just bend it \u2026make a little slit and thread the little triangle through.&#34;\n And what we ended up with looked a bit like this. The triangle shape, poked through the letter, is then folded over the edges and stuck down with glue or wax.\n  You can try the triangle lock for yourself using  this video demonstration, or the team&#39;s diagram below, along with two others that they have identified.\n The second one in the diagram (middle) is modelled after a letter between two cousins from the Brienne Collection that the team recently  &#34;virtually unfolded&#34; using X-ray microtomography. This meant that they could open up the folds without having to unseal any of the locks.\n And if you fancy a true folding challenge, the third (bottom) is called the &#34;dagger trap&#34;, based on a British intelligence letter, sent from Italy in 1601, which Dambrogio and Starza Smith found in the UK National Archives. It was &#34;the most secure, complicated, and time-consuming letter we\u2019ve encountered&#34;. While it would have appeared to be a simple pleated letter from the outside, it was essentially booby-trapped, with a hidden strip of paper inside that &#34;trips&#34; when opened, revealing it had been unlocked. (This  video walk-through may help.)\n  Today, when people think about keeping their messages secure from prying eyes, they tend to focus on digital communication, such as the &#34;end-to-end encryption&#34; of services such as WhatsApp or Signal. But letterlocking demonstrates that the urge to communicate securely is much older than many might assume.\n &#34;As far back as humans have walked the Earth and wanted to document something, there&#39;s been a need to have discretion,&#34; says Dambrogio. The Ancient Greeks and Egyptians used seals for correspondence and notarisation. And the documentation of Mesopotamia, thousands of years ago, was often encased in clay envelopes called  bullae.\n These tricks for tamper-resistant communication have sometimes even played a role in pivotal historical events. When Mary Queen of Scots locked her last letter, she was acutely aware that the ruling powers might read her message, and wanted her brother-in-law to know if they did. After all, a previously intercepted letter was the reason that she faced her predicament: she had been caught authorising a plot to assassinate Elizabeth I.\n In this light, then, letterlocking becomes a new lens through which to view history and the ways we have sought to connect with one another over the centuries. As Starza Smith points out about the significance of Mary&#39;s final actions: &#34;People often say the last thing she did before she was executed was to write a letter. Not true!

I\u2019ve worked 70-hour weeks. I\u2019ve left work at 3:00 a.m, only to show back up at 10:00 a.m., after getting robbed on my way home. I\u2019ve ignored injuries to avoid the hassle of getting my shift covered.\n  The job is not glamorous, but it can be rewarding. Lately, however, I read a new story almost daily about a  massive  worker  shortage that\u2019s forcing restaurants to cut hours or close altogether. According to  one such piece in the Washington  Post, the culprit is \u201cunemployment benefits and pandemic assistance,\u201d which offer more money than a typical hospitality job \u2014 we\u2019re being told that workers would rather stay home living off an overly generous government. The New York  Post, for its part,  blames \u201cworkers who say they\u2019re better off collecting COVID-relief-bill enhanced unemployment checks.\u201d\n  Presumably, people who say this have never had to rely on those \u201cenhanced\u201d unemployment benefits to survive, as I did for nine months of this pandemic. I know what it\u2019s like to stay up all night worrying about bills. I once walked through my apartment making a list of all the belongings I could sell if I needed to.\n  Nobody chooses to live like this instead of going to a good-paying, reliable job. Instead, the industry was deeply flawed before COVID-19, and the pandemic only made things worse. Workers are staying away because the industry has never treated them with respect, and if restaurateurs expect to change nothing, and return to a time when they could count on a huge stack of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s from highly skilled individuals who would put up with all manner of abuse for meager pay, they are mistaken.\n  Long before lockdown, I worked in a restaurant that charged $225 for a meal prepared largely by an army of  stagiaires, unpaid kitchen staff working for \u201cexperience.\u201d There, I saw every angry-chef stereotype you can imagine: plates and pans thrown across kitchens, screaming, even physical abuse. I\u2019ve seen pot handles heated until they\u2019re glowing and left on a stove top for an unsuspecting line cook to grab while the rest of the staff chuckles. Racism and sexism, both from guests to staff and among employees, are rampant.\n  That abuse has always been stacked on top of low pay and owners who can\u2019t always be counted on to pay their employees in a timely manner. I\u2019ve been told to wait a few days before cashing paychecks, and have had direct deposits not go through because of \u201caccounting issues.\u201d Front-of-house staffers are paid  less than minimum wage in most states and make the majority of their income in tips, which disproportionately  benefit white men. Cooks, when they\u2019re paid at all, are frequently victims of  wage theft and  unpaid overtime.\n  Now, on top of all these issues, we\u2019ve been asked to work throughout a global pandemic, one that has been  particularly deadly for restaurant workers. Even though vaccines are widely available, only about half of American adults are vaccinated, and operators can\u2019t be counted on to prioritize their own employees\u2019 safety. This summer, I worked at a restaurant where the entire staff was exposed to someone with COVID. We closed for one day.\n  The  nature of the work has changed, too. Under the best circumstances, I get to be part of dozens of small celebrations every night \u2014 people come to toast engagements, weddings, birthdays, and promotions. It is deeply gratifying to make people happy every night. But now, instead of being providers, servers have been turned into cops: We must enforce countless, ever-changing rules and regulations for diners who simply don\u2019t care. Every night it\u2019s, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t move the tables; no, your friends can\u2019t join your ten-top; no, you can\u2019t stand up and walk around maskless.\u201d Some people are understanding, but most times, guests react as though we personally drafted these rules specifically to ruin their night. They beg, they withhold tips, they scream at us, and in extreme cases, they  assault us.\n  Asking for better working conditions is treated as a sign of laziness and entitlement. I can\u2019t count how many times a complaint to management has been met with, \u201cYou could always work somewhere else.\u201d Sucking it up and putting on a happy face is the only way to show that you\u2019re a \u201ctrue professional.\u201d\n  This is the only career I\u2019ve ever known and I desperately want this industry to succeed. There\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t. The  majority of staff leaving their restaurant jobs say they would stay if they were just paid a stable, living wage.\n  I understand the devastation that this pandemic wrought on our industry \u2014 80,000 restaurants have  closed permanently across the country \u2014 and I am fortunate to currently work somewhere with great owners who pay well and treat their employees with dignity and respect. But I shouldn\u2019t have to count myself among \u201cthe lucky ones.\u201d\n  The restaurants that come out of this period the strongest will be run by owners who understand this, and who know that putting the welfare of their employees first is the only real way forward. We take pride in our work; we only want to work for people who value that commitment with simple respect that has disappeared from far too many dining rooms.\n  This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and

", "note_en": "We are thrilled to release .NET 6 Preview 5. We\u2019re now in the second-half of the .NET 6 release, and starting to see significant features coming together. A great example is .NET SDK Workloads, which is the foundation of our  .NET unification vision and enables supporting more application types. Like other features, it is coming together to provide a compelling end-to-end user experience.\n   See the  ASP.NET Core,\u00a0 EF Core, and  .NET MAUI posts for more detail on what\u2019s new for web, data access, and cross-platform UI scenarios.\n Visual Studio 2022 Preview 1 is also releasing today and .NET 6 Preview 5 is included in that release. .NET 6 has also been tested with  Visual Studio 16.11 and  Visual Studio for Mac 8.9. We recommend you use those builds if you want to try .NET 6 with  Visual Studio.\n Check out the new  conversations posts for in-depth engineer-to-engineer discussions of the latest .NET features.\n  SDK workloads is a new .NET SDK feature that enables us to add support for new application types \u2014 like  mobile and  WebAssembly \u2014 without increasing the size of the SDK.\n The workloads feature has been updated to include  list and  update verbs. These new capabilities provide a sense of the expected final experience. You\u2019ll be able to quickly establish your preferred environment with a few simple commands and to keep it up-to-date over time.\n  The  update verb queries  nuget.org for updated workload manifests, updates local manifests, downloads new versions of the installed workloads, and then removes all old versions of a workload. This is analogous to  apt update and  apt upgrade -y (used on Debian-based Linux distros).\n The  dotnet workload commands operate in the context of the given SDK. Imagine you have both .NET 6 and .NET 7 installed. If you use both, the workloads commands will provide different results since the workloads will be different (at least different versions of the same workloads).\n As you can see, the workloads feature is essentially a package manager for the .NET SDK. Workloads were first introduced in the  .NET 6 preview 4 release.\n  Package Validation tooling will enable NuGet library developers to validate that their packages are consistent and well-formed.\n  Validate that the package has the same set of publics APIs for all runtime-specific implementations.\n    In .NET 5, we shipped approximately 250 analyzers with the .NET SDK. Many of them already existed but were shipped out-of-band as NuGet packages. We\u2019re  adding more analyzers for .NET 6.\n By default most of the new analyzers are enabled at Info level. You can enable these analyzers at Warning level by  configuring the analysis mode like this:  &lt;AnalysisMode&gt;AllEnabledByDefault&lt;/AnalysisMode&gt;.\n We published the set of analyzers we wanted for .NET 6 (plus some extras) and then made most of them  up-for-grabs.\n Credit to  Newell Clark\u00a0and\u00a0 Meik Tranel\u00a0for the following implementations, included in Preview 5. Note that the community has contributed other implementations in previous previews.\n    The CA1416 Platform Compatibility analyzer already recognizes platform guards using the methods in OperatingSystem/RuntimeInformation, such as  OperatingSystem.IsWindows and  OperatingSystem.IsWindowsVersionAtLeast. However,  the analyzer does not recognize any other guard possibilities like the platform check result cached in a field or property, or complex platform check logic is defined in a helper method.\n For  allowing custom guard possibilities we  added new attributes  SupportedOSPlatformGuard and  UnsupportedOSPlatformGuard for annotating the custom guard members with the corresponding platform name and/or version. This annotation is recognized and respected by the Platform Compatibility analyzer\u2019s flow analysis logic.\n  [UnsupportedOSPlatformGuard(&#34;browser&#34;)] // The platform guard attribute\r#if TARGET_BROWSER\r internal bool IsSupported =&gt; false;\r#else\r internal bool IsSupported =&gt; true;\r#endif\r\r [UnsupportedOSPlatform(&#34;browser&#34;)]\r void ApiNotSupportedOnBrowser() { }\r\r void M1()\r {\r ApiNotSupportedOnBrowser(); // Warns: This call site is reachable on all platforms.&#39;ApiNotSupportedOnBrowser()&#39; is unsupported on: &#39;browser&#39;\r\r if (IsSupported)\r {\r ApiNotSupportedOnBrowser(); // Not warn\r }\r }\r\r [SupportedOSPlatform(&#34;Windows&#34;)]\r [SupportedOSPlatform(&#34;Linux&#34;)]\r void ApiOnlyWorkOnWindowsLinux() { }\r\r [SupportedOSPlatformGuard(&#34;Linux&#34;)]\r [SupportedOSPlatformGuard(&#34;Windows&#34;)]\r private readonly bool _isWindowOrLinux = OperatingSystem.IsLinux() || OperatingSystem.IsWindows();\r\r void M2()\r {\r ApiOnlyWorkOnWindowsLinux(); // This call site is reachable on all platforms.&#39;ApiOnlyWorkOnWindowsLinux()&#39; is only supported on: &#39;Linux&#39;, &#39;Windows&#39;.\r\r if (_isWindowOrLinux)\r {\r ApiOnlyWorkOnWindowsLinux(); // Not warn\r }\r }\r}\n  You can now  set a default font for an application with  Application.SetDefaultFont. The pattern you use is similar to setting high dpi or visual styles.\n class Program\r{\r [STAThread]\r static void Main()\r {\r Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.SystemAware);\r Application.EnableVisualStyles();\r Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\r\r+ Application.SetDefaultFont(new Font(new FontFamily(&#34;Microsoft Sans Serif&#34;), 8f));\r\r Application.Run(new Form1());\r }\r}\n      The  default font was updated in .NET Core 3.0. However that change introduced a significant hurdle for some users migrating .NET Framework apps to .NET Core. This new change makes it straightforward to choose the desired font for an app and removes that migration hurdle.\n  Dropping a framework from a package is a source breaking change. At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we\u2019ve solved this issue by  harvesting, which basically meant:\n During build, we download the earlier version of the package and harvest the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\n While this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you\u2019ll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can\u2019t be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you\u2019re able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you\u2019re consuming the same old binary that we\u2019re no longer updating.\n Starting with .NET 6 Preview 5, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we\u2019re dropping support for any framework that is older than these:\n  If you\u2019re currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you\u2019ll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later framework version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you\u2019re already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\n For more details, including the full list of impacted packages, see  dotnet/announcement: Dropping older framework versions.\n  We\u2019ve been improving  Microsoft.Extensions APIs this release. In Preview 5, we\u2019ve focused on hosting and dependency injection. In Preview 4, we added a  compile-time source generator for logging.\n   We added a new ConfigureHostOptions API on IHostBuilder to make application setup simpler (e.g. configuring the shutdown timeout):\n   using HostBuilder host = new()\r .ConfigureServices(services =&gt;\r {\r services.Configure&lt;HostOptions&gt;(o =&gt;\r {\r o.ShutdownTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);\r });\r })\r .Build();\r\rhost.Run();\n  You might have noticed that disposal of a service provider will throw an  InvalidOperationException when it happens to register an IAsyncDisposable service.\n The new  CreateAsyncScope API provides a straightforward solution, as you can see in the following example:\n   using System;\rusing System.Threading.Tasks;\rusing Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;\r\rawait using var provider = new ServiceCollection()\r .AddScoped&lt;Foo&gt;()\r .BuildServiceProvider();\r\r// This using can throw InvalidOperationException\rusing (var scope = provider.CreateScope())\r{\r var foo = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService&lt;Foo&gt;();\r}\r\rclass Foo : IAsyncDisposable\r{\r public ValueTask DisposeAsync() =&gt; default;\r}\n     The backbone of nearly all .NET serializers is reflection. Reflection is a great capability for certain scenarios, but not as the basis of high-performance cloud-native applications (which typically (de)serialize and process a lot of JSON documents). Reflection is a problem for  startup, memory usage, and  assembly trimming.\n The alternative to runtime reflection is compile-time  source generation.  Source generators generate C# source files that can be compiled as part of the library or application build. Generating source code at compile time can provide many benefits to .NET applications, including improved performance.\n In .NET 6, we are including a new source generator as part of  System.Text.Json. The JSON source generator works in conjunction with  JsonSerializer, and can be configured in multiple ways. It\u2019s your decision whether you use the new source generator. It can provide the following benefits:\n  For example, instead of dynamically generating methods at runtime to get and set class properties during (de)serialization using  Reflection.Emit (which uses private memory and has start-up costs), a source generator can generate code that more simply and efficiently assigns or retrieves a value directly to/from properties, which is lightning fast.\n You can try out the source generator by using the latest preview version of the  System.Text.Json NuGet package. We are working on a  proposal for including source generators within the SDK.\n  By default, the JSON source generator emits serialization logic for the given serializable types. This delivers higher performance than using the existing  JsonSerializer methods by generating source code that uses  Utf8JsonWriter directly. In short, source generators offer a way of giving you a different implementation at compile-time in order to make the runtime experience better.\n Zooming out,  JsonSerializer is a powerful tool which has many features (and even more coming!) that can improve the (de)serialization of .NET types from/into the JSON format. It is fast, but can have some performance overhead when only a subset of features are needed for a serialization routine. Going forward, we will update  JsonSerializer and the new source generator together.\n  namespace Test\r{\r internal class JsonMessage\r {\r public string Message { get; set; }\r }\r}\n The source generator can be configured to generate serialization logic for instances of the example  JsonMessage type. Note that the class name  JsonContext is arbitrary. You can use whichever class name you want for the generated source.\n using System.Text.Json.Serialization;\r\rnamespace Test\r{\r [JsonSerializable(typeof(JsonMessage)]\r internal partial class JsonContext : JsonSerializerContext\r {\r }\r}\n We have defined a  set of  JsonSerializer features that are supported with the source generation mode that provides the best serialization throughput, via  JsonSerializerOptionsAttribute. These features can be specified to the source generator ahead of time, to avoid extra checks at runtime. If the attribute is not used, then default  JsonSerializationOptions are assumed at runtime.\n As part of the build, the source generator augments the  JsonContext partial class with the following shape:\n internal partial class JsonContext : JsonSerializerContext\r{\r public static JsonContext Default { get; }\r\r public JsonTypeInfo&lt;JsonMessage&gt; JsonMessage { get; }\r\r public JsonContext(JsonSerializerOptions options) { }\r\r public override JsonTypeInfo GetTypeInfo(Type type) =&gt; ...;\r}\n The serializer invocation with this mode could look like the following example. This example provides the best possible performance.\n using MemoryStream ms = new();\rusing Utf8JsonWriter writer = new(ms);\r\rJsonContext.Default.JsonMessage.Serialize(writer, new JsonMessage { &#34;Hello, world!&#34; });\rwriter.Flush();\r\r// Writer contains:\r// {&#34;Message&#34;:&#34;Hello, world!&#34;}\n Alternatively, you can continue to use  JsonSerializer, and instead pass an instance of the generated code to it, with  JsonContext.Default.JsonMessage.\n    The difference between these two overloads is that the first is using the typed metadata implementation \u2014  JsonTypeInfo&lt;T&gt; \u2014 and the second one is using a more general untyped implementation that does type tests to determine if a typed implementation exists within the context instance. It is a little slower (due to the type tests), as a result. If there is not a source-generated implementation for a given type, then the serializer throws a  NotSupportedException. It does not fallback to a reflection-based implementation (as an explicit design choice).\n The fastest and most optimized source generation mode \u2014 based on  Utf8JsonWriter \u2014 is currently only available for serialization. Similar support for deserialization \u2014 based on  Utf8JsonReader \u2014 may be provided in the future depending on your feedback.\n However, the source generator also emits type-metadata initialization logic that can benefit deserialization as well. To deserialize an instance of  JsonMessage using pre-generated type metadata, you can do the following:\n     Multiple types can be included for source generation via  [JsonSerializable] on a derived, partial  JsonSerializerContext instance, not just one.\n The source generator also supports nested object and collection members on objects, not just primitive types.\n  Compression is important for any data transmitted over a network.  WebSockets now enable compression. We used an implementation of  permessage-deflate extension for WebSockets,  RFC 7692. It allows compressing WebSockets message payloads using DEFLATE algorithm.\n This feature was one of the top user requests for Networking on GitHub. You can follow our journey to providing that API via  API review 1 and  API review 2.\n  We realized that using compression together with encryption may lead to attacks, like  CRIME and  BREACH. It means that a secret cannot be sent together with user-generated data in a single compression context, otherwise that secret could be extracted. To bring user\u2019s attention to these implications and help them weigh the risks, we renamed our API to  DangerousDeflateOptions. We also added the ability to turn off compression for specific messages, so if the user would want to send a secret, they could do that securely without compression.\n There was also a  follow-up by  Ivan that reduced the memory footprint of the WebSocket when compression is disabled by about 27%.\n Enabling the compression from the client side is easy, see the example below. However, please bear in mind that the server can negotiate the settings, e.g. request smaller window, or deny the compression completely.\n var cws = new ClientWebSocket();\rcws.Options.DangerousDeflateOptions = new WebSocketDeflateOptions()\r{\r ClientMaxWindowBits = 10,\r ServerMaxWindowBits = 10\r};\n WebSocket compression support for ASP.NET Core was also recently added. It will be included in an upcoming preview.\n  SOCKS is a proxy server implementation that can process any TCP or UDP traffic, making it a very versatile system. It is a  long-standing community request that has been  added to .NET 6.\n This change adds support for Socks4, Socks4a, and Socks5. For example, it enables testing external connections via SSH or  connecting to the Tor network.\n The  WebProxy class now accepts  socks schemes, as you can see in the following example.\n var handler = new HttpClientHandler\r{\r Proxy = new WebProxy(&#34;socks5://127.0.0.1&#34;, 9050)\r};\rvar httpClient = new HttpClient(handler);\n   We\u2019ve been  adding support for OpenTelemetry for the last couple .NET versions, as part of our focus on  observability. In .NET 6, we\u2019re adding  support for the  OpenTelemetry Metrics API. By adding support for OpenTelemetry, your apps can seamlessly interoperate with other  OpenTelemetry systems.\n System.Diagnostics.Metrics is the .NET implementation of the  OpenTelemetry Metrics API specification. The Metrics APIs are designed explicitly for processing raw measurements, generally with the intent to produce continuous summaries of those measurements, efficiently and simultaneously.\n The APIs include the  Meter class which can be used to create instrument objects (e.g. Counter). The APIs expose four instrument classes:  Counter,  Histogram,  ObservableCounter, and  ObservableGauge to support different metrics scenarios. Also, the APIs expose the  MeterListener class to allow listening to the instrument\u2019s recorded measurement for aggregation and grouping purposes.\n The  OpenTelemetry .NET implementation will be extended to use these new APIs, which add support for Metrics observability scenarios.\n  Meter meter = new Meter(&#34;io.opentelemetry.contrib.mongodb&#34;, &#34;v1.0&#34;);\r Counter&lt;int&gt; counter = meter.CreateCounter&lt;int&gt;(&#34;Requests&#34;);\r counter.Add(1);\r counter.Add(1, KeyValuePair.Create&lt;string, object&gt;(&#34;request&#34;, &#34;read&#34;));\n  MeterListener listener = new MeterListener();\r listener.InstrumentPublished = (instrument, meterListener) =&gt;\r {\r if (instrument.Name == &#34;Requests&#34; &amp;&amp; instrument.Meter.Name == &#34;io.opentelemetry.contrib.mongodb&#34;)\r {\r meterListener.EnableMeasurementEvents(instrument, null);\r }\r };\r listener.SetMeasurementEventCallback&lt;int&gt;((instrument, measurement, tags, state) =&gt;\r {\r Console.WriteLine($&#34;Instrument: {instrument.Name} has recorded the measurement {measurement}&#34;);\r });\r listener.Start();\n  Parsing of BigIntegers from both decimal and hexadecimal strings has been improved. We see  improvements of up to 89%, as demonstrated in the following chart.\n    Vector&lt;T&gt;  now supports the  nint and  nuint primitive types, added in C# 9. For example, this change should make it simpler to use SIMD instructions with pointers or platform-dependent lengths.\n  .NET cryptography APIs support using  OpenSSL 3 as the preferred native cryptography provider on Linux. .NET 6 will use OpenSSL 3 if it is available. Otherwise, it will use OpenSSL 1.x.\n  The  ChaCha20Poly1305 class has been added to  System.Security.Cryptography. In order to use the ChaCha20/Poly1305 algorithm, it must be supported by the underlying operating system. The static  IsSupported property can be used to determine if the algorithm is supported in a given context.\n    The team has been  adding Objective-C support, with the goal of having a single  Objective-C interop implementation for .NET. Up until now, the  Objective-C interop system was built around the Mono embedding API but we decided it wasn\u2019t the right approach to share across runtimes. As a result we\u2019ve create a new .NET API that will enable a single Objective-C interop experience that will eventually work on both runtimes.\n This new API for Objective-C interop has brought immediate support in both runtimes for   NSAutoreleasePool, which  enables support for Cocoa\u2019s reference-counted memory management system. You can now  configure whether you want each managed thread to have an implicit  NSAutoreleasePool. This enables the release of Cocoa objects on a per-thread basis.\n  A lot of  diagnostics features have been added into MonoVM since beginning of .NET 6. This has enabled features like managed EventSource/EventListener, EventPipe and DiagnosticsServer. It has enabled using diagnostics tools like  dotnet-trace,  dotnet-counters,  dotnet-stacks for apps running on mobile devices (iOS/Android) as well as desktop.\n These new features opens up ability to analyse nettrace files generated by MonoVM in tools like PrefView/Speed\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-18 22:34:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Pornhub was sued yesterday by 34 women alleging that the site hosted videos without their consent and profited from other nonconsensual content involving rape, child sexual abuse, and human trafficking.\n Of the victims involved in the lawsuit, 14 said they were victims of people charged with or convicted of sex crimes, and 14 said they were underage in the videos served on Pornhub.\n \u201cIt is time for the companies and individuals who have profited off of nonconsensual and illegal content be held liable for their crime,\u201d one of the plaintiffs said in a conference call reported by  CNN. \u201cI joined the lawsuit because I seek justice for myself and the countless victims who don&#39;t come forward.\u201d\n Pornhub\u2019s parent company, MindGeek, which owns or runs over 150 pornographic websites, was included in the lawsuit. Pornhub, which is among the largest pornography websites on the internet, drew scrutiny last December when New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof published a feature alleging that it \u201cmonetizes child rapes, revenge pornography, spy cam videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content, and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags.\u201d\n  At the time, the site reportedly received 6.8 million new videos per year, making it one of the largest video platforms on the web. In the wake of Kristof\u2019s article, MasterCard and Visa  investigated the site. The announcement sent Pornhub scrambling, and within two days, the site  blocked uploads by unidentified users and removed the ability to download videos (except for \u201cpaid downloads within the verified Model Program,\u201d the site said at the time). The changes weren\u2019t enough, though, and MasterCard and Visa both  banned it from their payment networks. Several days later, Pornhub  purged millions of user-uploaded videos, representing around two-thirds of the site\u2019s content.\n  In February, Pornhub announced that it had expanded moderation by relying on both software and \u201can extensive team of human moderators\u201d who review every upload. It also took a page from Facebook and let nonprofit groups do some of the lifting, giving them a \u201ctrusted flagger program\u201d that would disable videos those groups thought contained illegal content. Lastly, they began working with a third party, Yoti, to  verify the identities of its users. Despite those measures, Pornhub does not follow other standards that are followed in the more traditional pornography industry. It does not, for example, verify the ages of everyone in videos hosted on the site, nor does it confirm that they consented to the videos being taken or uploaded.\n    The lawsuit was filed by Brown Rudnick LLP, and several of the alleged victims who signed on were found through a site called Traffickinghub, which seeks to shut down Pornhub. The site is run by a religious organization known as Exodus Cry, and  CBS News notes the group \u201chas been criticized for its efforts to criminalize parts the sex industry and abolish pornography altogether.\u201d\n Yet Michael Bowe, the lawyer representing the women in the lawsuit, told CBS that he was not seeking to outlaw online porn but bring it in line with traditional pornography rules and regulations. \u201cThis case is not about porn, it\u2019s about rape. This is a legitimate industry that consenting people have every right to participate in. It just needs to be done legally and not with illegal content.\u201d he told CBS.\n Yesterday\u2019s lawsuit wasn\u2019t the first time Pornhub has been sued for hosting videos that allegedly featured sex trafficking. In December, shortly after MasterCard and Visa began their investigations, 40 women  filed a lawsuit saying they were victims of GirlsDoPorn, a company whose producers lured victims with \u201cfake modeling ads, false promises and deceptive front companies, ultimately devolving to threats to coerce these women into making sex videos,\u201d Acting US Attorney Randy Grossman  said after a recent sentencing hearing for one of the producers and actors who was convicted of crimes associated with his work for the site. In the February lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that \u201cMindGeek knew GirlsDoPorn was trafficking its victims by using fraud, coercion, and intimidation as part of its customary business practices to get the women to film the videos.\u201d\n MindGeek is also  under investigation by Canada\u2019s privacy commissioner.

In 2019, there were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria and 409,000 deaths globally, creating an extraordinary cost in terms of human morbidity, mortality, economic burden, and regional social stability. Worldwide, Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite species which causes the vast majority of deaths. Those at highest risk of severe disease include pregnant women, children and malaria na\u00efve travelers. Malaria countermeasures development has historically been a priority research area for the Department of Defense as the disease remains a top threat to U.S.   deployed to endemic regions.\n  A safe, effective malaria   has long been an elusive target for scientists. The most advanced malaria vaccine is RTS,S, a first-generation product developed in partnership with WRAIR. RTS,S is based on the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum, the most dangerous and widespread species of malaria parasite. While RTS,S is an impactful countermeasure in the fight against malaria, field studies have revealed limited sterile efficacy and duration of protection. The limitations associated with RTS,S and other first-generation malaria vaccines have led scientists to evaluate new platforms and second-generation approaches for malaria vaccines.\n  &#34;Recent successes with vaccines against COVID-19 highlight the advantages of mRNA-based platforms\u2014notably highly targeted design, flexible and rapid manufacturing and ability to promote strong immune responses in a manner not yet explored,&#34; said Dr. Evelina Angov, a researcher at WRAIR&#39;s Malaria Biologics Branch and senior author on the paper. &#34;Our goal is to translate those advances to a safe, effective vaccine against malaria.&#34;\n  Like RTS,S, the vaccine relies on P. falciparum&#39;s circumsporozoite protein to elicit an immune response. However, rather than administering a version of the protein directly, this approach uses mRNA\u2014accompanied by a lipid nanoparticle which protects from premature degradation and helps stimulate the immune system\u2014 to prompt cells to code for circumsporozoite protein themselves. Those proteins then trigger a protective response against malaria but cannot actually cause infection.\n  &#34;Our vaccine achieved high levels of protection against malaria infection in mice,&#34; said Katherine Mallory, a WRAIR researcher at the time of the article&#39;s submission and lead author on the paper. &#34;While more work remains before clinical testing, these results are an encouraging sign that an effective, mRNA-based   vaccine is achievable.&#34;             Citation: mRNA vaccine yields full protection against malaria in mice (2021, June 18) retrieved 18 June 2021 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-mrna-vaccine-yields-full-malaria.html\n  This document is subject to copyright.

open a formal investigation into its lucrative digital advertising business before the end of the year, said people familiar with the matter.\n It would mark a new front by the EU competition enforcer against Google. It has in the last decade fined the company more than 8 billion euros ($9.8 billion) for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising.\n An EU probe would focus on Google&#39;s position vis-a-vis advertisers, publishers, intermediaries and rivals, one of the people said, indicating deeper scrutiny than the French antitrust agency&#39;s case concluded last week.\n Google made $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world. Ads on its properties, including search, YouTube and Gmail, accounted for the bulk of sales and profits.\n About 16% of revenue came from its display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.\n Both units are under fire. The U.S. Justice Department, joined by some states, sued Google last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house.\n France last week settled with Google for $268 million and various commitments over similar allegations related to the network business, and the unit also must work closely with Britain&#39;s competition regulator on upcoming software changes as part of a settlement reached days later.  read more\n The Commission declined to comment. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google&#39;s ad empire. Market researcher eMarketer expects Google to control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display.\n While the numbers may not look monopolistic at first blush, advertisers and rivals contend that Google&#39;s various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid.\n They say Google takes advantage of the dependence buyers, sellers and intermediaries have on it to extract high fees from all sides and block rivals from fairly competing with it.\n In a questionnaire sent to Google rivals and third parties earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog asked if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.   read more\n The Commission should conclude ongoing cases before starting new ones, said Thomas Hoppner, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, and who advises several complainants against Google.\n &#34;From the practitioner&#39;s point of view and from the industry&#39;s point of view, it appears equally important to bring investigations into local search and Google&#39;s job search to an end when other authorities have opened investigations into Google&#39;s adtech,&#34;

This information will continue to be updated and overlaps somewhat with the  coreutils FAQ,with this list focusing on less frequent potential issues.\n chmod -R is redundant and tricky.If for example you copy a dir from VFAT and want to turn off executable bits on filesusing  chmod -R 644,that will fail to recurse as it removes the executable bits from dirs.This is achievable in various ways:  cut doesn&#39;t work with fields separated by arbitrary whitespace.It&#39;s often better to use  awk oreven  join -a1 -o1.$field $file /dev/null cut -s only suppresses lines without delimiters.Therefore if you have a line with a missing fieldbut it does contain some delimiters, a blank line is output\n Similarly, if you want to output a blank line when there are no delimitersone needs to append a delimiter like:\n  dd  iflag=fullblock is usually what you wantbecause when reading from a fifo/pipe you often get a short read,which means you get too little data if you specify &#34; count&#34;,or too much data if you specify &#34; sync&#34;. For example: Note we do warn in certain cases since version 8.10, but not with count=1 aboveas short reads are often used with count=1 as an idiom to &#34;consume available data&#34;,though perhaps  dd iflag=nonblock would be a moredirect and general way to do that? dd  conv=noerror really also needs  conv=syncso that if reading from failing disk,one gets correctly aligned data, with unreadable bits replaced with NULs.Note if there is a read error anywhere in a block,the whole block will be discarded. So one needsto balance between speed (bigger) and minimized data loss (smaller).This is simpler and more dynamic in a more dedicated toollike  ddrescue.\n dd  skip=0x100 doesn&#39;t skip anythingas the &#34;0x&#34; prefix is treated as a zero multiplier.coreutils &gt;= 8.26 will warn about this at least,suggesting to use &#34;00x&#34; if that really was the intention.\n For full portability the  -P option is neededwhen parsing the output from df. Line wrapping is avoided, thoughdf will no longer wrap lines since version 8.11 (Apr 2011) to helpavoid this gotcha. Also if one needs to parse the header,the  -P option will use more standardised (but ambiguous) wording.See also the  Block size issue. If two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of thehard links is counted. The FILE argument order affects which links arecounted, and changing the argument order may change the numbers that du outputs. Note this also impacts specified directories which is confusing: $ cd git/coreutils$ du -s ./ ./tests593120 ./$ du -s ./tests ./  # depth first gets items listed (though counted independently)10036 ./tests583084 ./ # Note order is significant even with implicit independence$ du -s --separate-dirs ./tests ./128 ./tests16268 ./$ du -s --separate-dirs ./ ./tests16268 ./\nNote du doesn&#39;t handle  reflinked files specially,and thus will count all instances of a reflinked file.  echo is non portable and its behaviour diverges betweensystems and shell builtins etc. One should really consider using printf instead.This shell session illustrates some inconsistencies.Where you see  env being used, that is selecting the coreutilsstandalone version: $ echo -e -n  # outputs nothing$ echo -n -e$ echo -- -n  # option terminator outputted-- -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -e -n-e -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -n -e  # no output either \u203d\n The exit status of expr is a confusing gotcha.POSIX states that exit status of 1 is used if &#34;the expression evaluates to null or zero&#34;,which you can see in these examples: $ expr 2 - 1; echo $?10$ expr 2 - 2; echo $?01$ expr substr 01 1 1; echo $?01$ expr &#39; &#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?10$ expr &#39;&#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?01 # number of matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;[0-9]$&#39;; echo $?10 # actual matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;\\([0-9]\\)$&#39;; echo $?01\nThe string matching above is especially confusing, thoughdoes conform to POSIX, and is consistent across solaris, FreeBSD and GNU utils. As for changing the behaviour, it&#39;s probably not possible due tobackwards compatibility issues. For example the &#39;^..*$&#39; casewould need to change the handling of the &#39;*&#39; in the expression,which would break a script like: printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; 1 2 &#39;&#39; 3 |while read line; do expr &#34;$line&#34; : &#39;^[0-9]*$&#39; &gt;/dev/null || break # at first blank line echo process &#34;$line&#34;done\nNote, using a leading ^ in the expression is redundant and non portable. ls -lrt will also reverse sort names for fileswith matching timestamps (common in /dev/ and /proc/ etc.)This is as per POSIX but probably not what the user wanted.There is no way to reverse by time and have non reversed name sorting.  ln -nsf is needed to update symlinks,though note that this will overwrite existing files,and cause links to be created within existing directories.  mkdir -p --mode=... only applies the mode to theright-most directory. Any parent directories are created with&#39;u+wx&#39; modified by umask. If you want to control the mode for all created dirs,you can use a umask like Note that the user &#39;wx&#39; bits can not be cleared for parent dirs.Note also that special mode bits like setuid are not set atomically,either with --mode on the right-most directory, or a subsequent chmod requiredfor created parent directories. Note also to be careful with  chmod -R  If changing the umask before invoking mkdir is not that easy - maybebecause not called via a shell -, then an alternative to the aboveumask method is to specify each of the target directories separately,e.g.: But it is important to know that &#39;mkdir&#39; does not adjust the permissionbits if any of those directories already existed.If you do want to ensure a directory hierarchy with particular permissionsone can use the `install` command instead like:   nl defaults to  -d &#39;\\:&#39; by default.Therefore any lines that contain only  &#39;\\:&#39;,  &#39;\\:\\:&#39;or  &#39;\\:\\:\\:&#39; will reset numbering.If you want to number lines irrespective on content then you need to specify  -d &#39;&#39;,or alternatively use the less flexible  cat -n option. The checksum utilities like md5sum, sha1sum etc. add backslashes to the output namesif those names contain &#39;\\n&#39; or &#39;\\&#39; characters. Also &#39;*&#39; is added to the outputwhere O_BINARY is significant (CYGWIN). Therefore automatic processing of theseutilities require one to  unescape first.  rm -rf does not mean &#34;delete as much as possible&#34;. It only avoids prompts.For example with a non writeable dir, you will not be ableto remove any contents. Therefore this is sometimes necessary to:  A very common issue encountered is with the default ordering of the  sort utility.Usually what is required is a simple byte comparison, though by default the collationorder of the current locale is used. To use the simple comparison logic you can LC_ALL=C sort ... as detailed in the FAQ. As well as being slower, the locale based ordering can often be surprising.For example some character representations,like the full width forms of latin numbers, compare equal to each other. $ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | ltrace -e strcoll sortsort-&gt;strcoll(&#34;\\357\\274\\222&#34;, &#34;\\357\\274\\221&#34;) = 0\uff12\uff11$ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | sort -u\uff12\nThe equal comparison issue with --unique can even impact inthe &#34;C&#34; locale, for example with  --numeric-sort dropping items unexpectedly.Note this example also demonstrates that --unique implies --stable,to select the first encountered item in the matching set.  Related to locale ordering, there is the  i18n patchon Fedora/RHEL/SUSE which has its own issues. Note disabling the locale specifichandling as described above effectively avoids these issues.  Example 2: case folding results in incorrect ordering:  Fields specified with  -k are separated by default by runs of blank characters (space and tab),and by default the blank characters preceding a field are  included in the comparison,which depending on your locale could be significant to the sorting order. This is confusing enoughon its own, but is compounded with the  --field-separator and  --ignore-leading-blanks options.Ignoring leading blanks (-b) is particularly confusing, because... Also precisely specifying a particular field, requires both the start  and endfields specified. I.E. to sort on field 2 you use -k2 ,2. These field delineation issues along with others are so confusing,that the  sort --debug option was addedin version 8.6 to highlight the matching extent and other consequences of the various options.\n  sort -R does randomize the input similarlyto the shuf command, but also ensures that matching keys are grouped together.shuf also provides optimizations when outputting a subset of the input.  split produces file names that may be surprising,as it defaults to a two letter suffix for initial files, butto support an arbitrary number of files, has a feature to widen the letters inthe output file names as needed. The widening scheme ensures file names are sorted correctlywhen using standard shell sorting, when subsequently listing orconcatenating the resultant files. For example:  split behaves the same with the --numeric-suffixes/-d option, which couldlead to unexpected numeric sequences. This was done again to ease sortingof the output (which is usually not inspected by humans for large sequences),but mainly for backwards compatibility with existing concatenation scriptsthat use standard sorting. The recommended solution is to specify a -a/--suffix-length parameterwhich still allows for standard ordering at the shell,but with more natural numbers:  tac like  wc has issues dealing with files withouta last &#39;\\n&#39; character.  tail -F is probably what you want rather than -fas the latter doesn&#39;t follow log rotations etc. tee by default will exit immediately upon receiving SIGPIPEto be POSIX compliant and to support applications like yes | tee log | timeout process.Now this is problematic in the presence of &#34;early close&#34; pipes,often seen when combining tee with bash &gt;(process substitutions).Starting with coreutils 8.24 (Jul 2015), tee has the new -p, --output-erroroption to control the operation in such cases. $ seq 100000 | tee &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)114139$ seq 100000 | tee -p &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)1100000\n The mode of operation of test depends on the number of arguments.Therefore you will not get an expected error in cases like test -s $file || echo no data &gt;&amp;2,if &#34;$file&#34; is empty or unset. That&#39;s because test(1) will thenbe operating in string testing mode, which will return successdue to &#34;-s&#34; being interpreted as a true expression.Instead ensure the variable is appropriately quoted to avoid such issues: test -s &#34;$file&#34; || echo no data &gt;&amp;2.  wc -l on a file in which the last linedoesn&#39;t end with &#39;\\n&#39; character will return a value of one-less thanmight be expected as wc is standardised to just count &#39;\\n&#39; characters.POSIX in fact doesn&#39;t consider a file without a &#39;\\n&#39; as the last characterto be a text file at all. Also by only counting &#39;\\n&#39; characters resultsin consistent counts whether counting concatenated files, ortotaling individual files.  wc -L counts the maximum  display width for a line,considering only valid, printable characters, but not terminal control codes. # invalid UTF-8 sequence not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\xf2\\xa5&#34; | wc -L0 # unprintable characters  even in the C locale are not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C wc -L0 # Bytes can be counted using sed:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C sed &#39;s/././g&#39; | wc -L3 # Terminal control chars are not handled specially:$ printf &#39;\\x1b[33mf\\bred\\x1b[m\\n&#39; | tee /dev/tty | wc -L red10\n The  df,  du,  ls --block-sizeoption is unusual in that appending a  B to the unit, changes it  from binary to decimal.I.E. KB means 1000, while K means 1024. In general the units representations in coreutils are unfortunate,but an accident of history.POSIX species &#39;k&#39; and &#39;b&#39; to mean 1024 and 512 respectively.Standards wise &#39;k&#39; should really mean 1000 and &#39;K&#39; 1024.Then extending from that we now have (which we can&#39;t change for compatibility reasons): Note there is new flexibility to consider when controlling theoutput of numeric units, by leveraging the  numfmtutility. For example to control the output of du you could definea function like:  Discussed separately at  Time zone ambiguities", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:51:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "When Ring wanted to boost sales of it surveillance cameras and burnish its self-styled image as a crime-fighting company, it embarked on a brand-ambassador marketing campaign that would be familiar to many startups. But rather than chase down the Instagram influencers or beat bloggers, the company instead wooed officers at the Los Angeles Police Department.\n For years, including during Amazon\u2019s early ownership of the company, Ring gave no fewer than 100 LAPD officers free devices or discount codes worth tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, according to a new report from the  Los Angeles Times.\n Emails obtained by the LA Times through a public records request reveal Ring employees encouraging LAPD officers to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods\u201d and offering freebies and discounts.\n \u201cRing and its relationship with police departments, including the LAPD, is but one example of a burgeoning problem in which there is a lack of clarity as to where the public sector ends and private surveillance capitalism begins,\u201d Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, told Ars.\n As word of the influencer campaign spread through the LAPD, officers who weren\u2019t approached by Ring employees reached out to them anyway, requesting free products and discounts.\n \u201cWe have a favor to ask..,\u201d wrote Officer Maria Gray. \u201cEvery year, we have a West LA Division Beach party... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d August Cziment, Ring\u2019s director of operations, replied, \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Another station received more than $12,000 in freebies after an officer sent an email containing promotional language that he first had Cziment approve.\n     LAPD has an  ethics code, of course. It says that officers may not \u201cuse their position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others\u201d and they \u201cshall not accept any gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business.\u201d But for many of the cases the Times uncovered, the LAPD did not appear to be concerned. Discount codes are \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar told the LA Times. \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis.\u201d\n One email exchange shows how officers blurred the lines between advocating for a class of security products like security cameras\u2014which is allowed and sometimes encouraged\u2014and becoming outright salespeople for specific brands like Ring. Officer Eric Mollinedo emailed Ring\u2019s Cziment in April 2016 asking for promo codes and a free doorbell, mentioning that he would be working a booth at a public safety fair. Cziment happily sent him a free unit along with flyers for the booth. Mollinedo later emailed Cziment, saying, \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n Tajsar, the ACLU attorney, said this sort of arrangement isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cRing in particular has a history of poaching police chiefs and executives, hiring them, and then using them to peddle Ring\u2019s wares with the connections they have from their former lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a revolving door Ring has created to gain market share across the country. That raises a whole host of ethical concerns about corruption, pay to play, and ethics rules around disclosures.\u201d\n  Ring\u2019s campaign came at a time when the company had partnered with LAPD to give out 500 free video doorbells in Los Angeles\u2019 Wilshire Park neighborhood in an attempt to prove its crime-fighting claims. In March 2016, LAPD and Ring held a  joint news conference announcing that, after installing just 40 cameras in the neighborhood, burglaries had dropped by 55 percent in six months. Later, the company would amend the results, saying the drop occurred over seven months, not six.\n    Neither claim was peer-reviewed, and Ring hasn\u2019t released the specifics of its study, but a report by  MIT Technology Review cast doubt on the findings. After receiving the locations of the installed cameras from the neighborhood association and after examining public data on crime in those districts, reporter Mark Harris found that burglaries had, in fact, increased when compared with the previous year. What\u2019s more, by 2017, burglaries had surged to their highest in seven years. Nonetheless, Ring  continued to tout its \u201ccrime fighting\u201d capabilities.\n  Ring wound down its influencer campaign around the time it rolled out its Neighbors app, which allows users to share and comment on nearby videos. LAPD was given access to a special Ring-provided portal to locate and request footage. The company bills the portal as a time-saver,  saying in videos it sends to police departments, \u201cNo more going door-to-door to look for cameras and asking for footage.\u201d All investigators have to do is set a specific time and area of interest and Ring assists in contacting users whose camera logs match the query.\n In addition to the arrangement with the LAPD, Ring has made deals with  hundreds of police departments across the US to give them access to the law enforcement portal. Ring\u2019s privacy policy regarding footage is \u201clax,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why Ring is so aggressively marketing toward police departments,\u201d Tajsar said. \u201cThey see police departments as the cat\u2019s paw. They can do Ring\u2019s marketing for them rather than Ring coming directly to us.\u201d\n The portal also allows law enforcement in many instances to sidestep the need for a warrant, which provides judicial oversight and greater transparency. Since many Ring users voluntarily post videos to the Neighbors app, departments have access to a pool of people who are more willing to share footage with them.\n After the LA Times contacted Ring for comment ahead of the story, the company updated its policies so people can view footage requests from law enforcement agencies by adding a post category called \u201cRequest for Assistance.\u201d The hitch? You have to use the Neighbors app to see the footage.\n The spread of a privately controlled surveillance network that offers ready access for law enforcement has privacy advocates concerned. \u201cThe potential for abuse here is tremendous,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cIt has so much room for civil liberties violations,\u201d Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, told the LA Times. \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:15:49",

The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a  225% increase in total losses from ransomware in the United States in 2020. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, businesses are under attack every 11 seconds, on average, and damage losses are projected to  reach $20 billion worldwide. Against this backdrop, the Cybereason Global Ransomware Study measured how much financial and reputational damage these attacks wreak on businesses.\n Dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack can be complicated and costly. The vast majority of organizations experienced  significant business impact due to ransomware attacks, including loss of revenue (66%), damage to the organization\u2019s brand (53%), unplanned workforce reductions (29%), and even closure of the business altogether (25%).\n   After an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top 5 solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%), security operations (SOC) (48%), endpoint protection (44%), data backup and recovery (43%), and email scanning (41%).\u00a0The least deployed solutions post-attack included web scanning (40%), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) technologies (38%), antivirus software (38%), mobile and SMS security solutions (36%), and managed security services provider (MSSP) or managed detection and response (MDR) provider (34%). Only 3% of respondents said they did not make any  new security investments after a ransomware attack.\n Cybereason\u2019s study found that the majority of organizations that chose to pay ransom demands in the past were not immune to subsequent ransomware attacks, often by the same threat actors. In fact, 80% of organizations that paid the ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half were hit by the same threat group.\n This study offers insight into the business impact of ransomware attacks across key industry verticals and reveals data that can be leveraged to improve ransomware defenses. For example, after an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top two solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%) and security operations (48%). This research underscores that prevention is the best strategy for managing ransomware risk and ensuring your organization does not fall victim to a ransomware attack in the first place.\n 1,263 cybersecurity professionals took part in the study commissioned by Cybereason and fielded by Censuswide, with participants in varying industries from the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.\n  VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

Katie Brown signed   House Bill 2574 into law on Tuesday, adding natural organic reduction to the range of approved after-life options in the west coast state. Sponsored and developed by Rep. Pam Marsh (D - Southern Jackson County), the bill met Oregonians\u2019 growing interest in sustainable alternatives to traditional deathcare.\n    \u201cThis is a hard issue for people to think about; it&#39;s not a decision that any of us get to avoid,\u201d Marsh told Motherboard over the phone. \u201cIt has an appeal, certainly not to all consumers, but to many of us who are really looking for ways to think about how our footprint on the earth continues after life is gone.\u201d\n  The move heeds a   growing call from environmentalists across the country to clean up the end-of-life industry. The most common methods of body disposal come with hefty environmental impacts: traditional burials, in which a corpse is embalmed with formaldehyde and placed in a casket underground, permanently   occupy large swaths of land and have been found to   leach toxins into nearby soil and waterways. Cremation\u2013in which a body is burned into ash\u2014is an energy suck and emits damaging   pollutants and   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n  By comparison, the process of so-called   natural organic reduction, which breaks down the body into soil, has a small environmental footprint. For example,   Recompose,   the country\u2019s first human composting funeral home does it like this: a corpse is placed in a cylinder with organic materials, like wood chips, plants, and straw, then heated and turned repeatedly for several weeks with a hook until it\u2019s broken down into a nutrient-rich soil that can be delivered back to the family or used for planting.\n   Human composting is the latest of a handful of environmental deathcare options to gain traction across the country as available   cemetery space declines and emissions from cremation mount .\n  Before human composting gained traction,   green burials\u2014in which the body is prepared without chemicals and planted underground in an organic, biodegradable container, often underneath a tree sapling\u2014emerged in 1998 as an alternative to traditional high-impact burial methods, according to the   Green Burial Council. Lauded as an environmentally superior deathcare method, it also makes reckoning with death easier for some. It\u2019s a difficult topic, says Jodie Buller, board member of the Conservation Burial Alliance, but knowing that you or a loved one can die sustainably\u2014through composting or green burials\u2014makes it easier to handle.\n  \u201cIt feels like a very peaceful option,\u201d Buller said. \u201cThe idea that the soil that someone becomes then can be used to nourish plants feels really good to people. It helps break down some of that taboo around death and dying.\u201d\n  Oregon\u2019s law, slated to go into effect in July, 2022, follows similar momentum in neighboring states. Washington became the first in the U.S. to legalize natural organic reduction in   2019, which led to the   opening of   Recompose.

 video) and over 100 augmentations. Each modality\u2019s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.\n AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook&#39;s -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you&#39;re working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these &#34;internet user&#34; types of data augmentations are prelevant.\n  To see more examples of augmentations, open the Colab notebooks in the README for each modality! (e.g. image  README &amp;  Colab)\n        Or clone AugLy if you want to be able to run our unit tests, contribute a pull request, etc:\n git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/AugLy.git[Optional, but recommended] conda create -n augly  &amp;&amp; conda activate augly  &amp;&amp; conda install pippip install -e AugLy/\n NOTE: In some environments,  pip doesn&#39;t install  python-magic as expected.

", "note_en": "In the database field and information retrieval in general, there is a very common scenario. I have a list of (sorted) integers that I want to store, and I want to do that in an as efficient a manner as possible. There are dozens of methods to do this and this is a hot topic for research. This is so useful because there are so many places where you can operate on a sorted integer list and gain massive benefits. Unlike generic compression routines, we can usually take advantage of the fact that we understand the data we are trying to work with and get better results.\n The reason I need to compress integers (actually, int64 values) is that I\u2019m trying to keep track of matches for some data, so the integers that I\u2019m tracking are actually file offsets for user\u2019s data inside of Voron. That lead to a few different scenarios that I have to deal with:\n  I\u2019m trying to figure out what is the best way to store the later two options in as efficient manner as possible.\n The first stop was  Daniel Lemire\u2019s blog, naturally, since he has wrote about this extensively. I looked at the following schemes: FastPFor and StreamVByte. They have somewhat different purposes, but basically, FastPFor is using a bits stream while StreamVByte is using byte oriented mode. Theoretically speaking, you can get better compression rate from FastPFor, but StreamVByte is supposed to be faster. Another integer compression system come from the Gorilla paper from Facebook, that is a bigger scheme, which include time series values compression. However, part of that scheme talks about how you can compress integers (they use that to store the ticks of a particular operation). We are actually using that for the time series support inside of RavenDB.\n I\u2019m not going to cover that in depth, here  is the paper on Gorilla compression, the relevant description is at section 4.1.1. Suffice to say that they are using a bit stream and delta of deltas computation. Basically, if you keep getting values that are the same distance apart, you don\u2019t need to record all the value, you can compute that naturally. In the best case scenario, Gorilla compression needs a single bit per value, assuming the results are spaced similarly.\n For my purpose, I want to get as high a compression rate as possible, and I need to store just the list of integers. The problem with Gorilla compression is that if we  aren\u2019t getting numbers that are the same distance apart, we need to record the  amount that they are different. That means that at a minimum, we\u2019ll need a minimum of 9 bits  per value. That adds up quickly, sadly.\n On the other hand, with PFor, there is a different system. PFor computes the maximum number of bits required for a  batch of integer, and then record just those values. I found the Binary Packing section (2.6) in  this paper to be the clearest explanation on how that works exactly.\u00a0 The problem with PFor, however, is that if you have a single large outlier, you\u2019ll waste a lot of bits unnecessarily.\n I decided to see if I can do something about that and created an encoder that works on batches of 128 integers at a time. This encoder will:\n Check the maximum number of bits required to record the  deltas of the integers. That along already saves us a lot.\n Then we check the top and bottom halves of the batch, to see if we\u2019ll get a benefit from recording them separately. A single large value (or a group of them) that is localized to a part of the batch will be recorded independently in this case.\n Finally, instead of only recording the meaningful bit ranges, we\u2019ll also analyze the batch we get further. The idea is to try to find ranges within the batch that have the same distance from one another. We can encode those as repetitions instead of each independent value. That can end up saving a surprisingly amount of space.\n You can look at the results of  my research here. I\u2019ll caution you that this is raw, but the results are promising. I\u2019m able to beat (in terms of compression rate) the standard PFor implementation by a bit, with a  lot less code.\n I\u2019m also looking at a compression rate of 30% \u2013 40% for realistic data sets. And if the data is setup just right and I\u2019m able to take advantage of the repeated delta optimization, I can pack things  real tight.\n Currently numbers say that I can push upward of 10,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer without any repeated deltas. It goes to just under 500,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer if I can take full advantage of the deltas.\n The reason I mention the delta so often, it is very likely that I\u2019ll record values that are roughly the same size, so we\u2019ll get offsets that are the same space from one another. In that case, my encoder goes to town and the compression rate is basically crazy.\n This is a  small piece of a much larger work, but this is the first time in a while that I got to code at Voron\u2019s level.

[1] The extreme temperatures in Antarctica \rnecessitated large amounts of fuel oil to maintain operations, making \rthe prospect of nuclear power, an attractive alternative. [1] During its \r10 year lifetime, the nuclear power station produced over 78 million \rkilowatt hours of electricity and produced 13 million gallons of fresh \rwater using the excess steam in a desalination plant. [1] Though this \rdevice reduced the necessity for fuel imports, it was plagued with \rproblems which ultimately forced its early retirement in 1972. The cost \rassociated with nuclear power in the Antarctic made it impractical, and \rdiesel-electric generators have since powered the base. [1] The PM-3A \rnuclear reactor that powered McMurdo Station stands as the only nuclear \rpower station to operate on the Antarctic continent.\n    The ice-free southern tip of the Hut Point Peninsula \ron Ross Island in Antarctica has a history of over 100 years of \rexploration and scientific history and is the site of the present day \rMcMurdo Station. [2] This site is located just 729 nautical miles from \rthe South Pole and is where Robert F. Scott staged the first expedition \rto the South Pole in 1902. [2] The United States established a permanent \rbase at this site beginning in December 1955 as part of Operation Deep \rFreeze I. [2] Known as Naval Air Facility McMurdo, this site was to \rserve as a sea port and logistics base from which to build and support a \rresearch facility at the geographic South Pole. [2] The name McMurdo was \rchosen to honour a lieutenant on the British ship HMS Terror that \rdiscovered Ross Island on an Antarctic expedition in 1841. [2] In 1958, \rthe site was renamed to McMurdo Station and has since maintained the \rability to support a population of over 1200 people. [2] McMurdo Station \rserves as the hub for activity in the Antarctic and is currently \roperated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), a division of \rthe Nation Science Foundation (NSF). [2]\n      The decision to install a nuclear power station at \rMcMurdo station was based on several factors. [3] First, there were \rdifficulties associated with supplying the large fuel demands required \rfor operations. Aircraft, diesel-electric generators, heating units, and \rvarious types of land vehicles consumed fuel in excess of half of the \rtotal freight delivered to Antarctica in the late 1950s. [3] To further \rcomplicate supply chain logistics, McMurdo can only be accessed by \rsupply ships during the aural summer months (summer in the southern \rhemisphere), thus requiring all supplies for the entire year to be \rdelivered during this short time frame. [3] It was concluded that an \rincreased supply of electricity from nuclear power would give rise to a \rmore efficient use of freight, reduced costs, as well as electric \rheating to replace the fire hazards associated with oil-fired heating \runits. [3] In addition, experience would be gained from installing and \roperating a nuclear power plant in an isolated and harsh environment. \r[3]\n  In August 1960, the United States Congress authorized \rthe design and construction of a nuclear reactor for McMurdo. [3] That \rsame month, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission contracted the Martin \rMarietta Company of Baltimore, Maryland to design, fabricate, test, \rpackage, transport, install, and initially operate the PM-3A (A for \rAntarctic) nuclear reactor on site in Antarctica. [4] The PM-3A reactor \ris a portable, medium sized nuclear reactor, the third of its type. [4] \rTwo others of this type were built and fielded prior to the PM-3A. [4] \rThe first was the PM-1, also built by Martin, which was used to power a \rremote radar station in Wyoming as part of the North American Aerospace \rDefense Command (NORAD). [4] The PM-2A (A for Arctic) was built by the \rAmerican Locomotive Company to power the remote US military base known \ras Camp Century setup in Northern Greenland. [4] Each of these reactors \rwas in the 1.25-2.0 MW power range, PM-1 and PM-3A were operational by \r1962, with PM-2A being operational in 1960. [4]\n    Fig. 3: Components of the PM-3A arriving at McMurdo. \r (Source:  United States\r Antartcia Program. Courtesy of the\r  NSF)\n  The PM-3A nuclear reactor was above all meant to be \rportable as it was designed with the LC-130 aircraft in mind as its \rdelivery system. [3] Although McMurdo is accessible by ship, it was \roriginally thought that this reactor would power bases inland such as \rthat located at the South Pole which are accessible only by aircraft. \r[3] For reliability and transportability reasons, the PM-3A was designed \rto be a pressurized water reactor. [3] Its core utilized highly enriched \ruranium, 93.1% in relative amount of the isotope U-235, whose fuel \rassembly was roughly the size of an oil drum. [5] Fig. 2 shows the \rinstallation of the PM-3A core onsite. The reactor arrived in modules at \rMcMurdo in December of 1961 by way of the USNS Arneb. [3] Fig. 3 shows \rone of the nuclear reactor modules being unloaded at McMurdo. The PM-3A \rwas assembled on a foundation of solid volcanic rock at an altitude of \r300 feet on the side of Observation Hill, a site that overlooks McMurdo \rStation. [3] Fig. 4 shows the completed reactor site overlooking McMurdo \rStation.\n  The PM-3A was operated by the Naval Nuclear \rPropulsion Unit consisting of a crew of 25. [3] The reactor went \rcritical in March of 1962 and supplied useful electricity to McMurdo in \rJuly of 1962. [3] It took a total of 23 months to complete testing and \rdebugging of the PM-3A nuclear plant. [3] After this time, control of \rthe plant was turned over from the Martin Company to the US Navy. [3] \rOnce fully operational, the role of the plant was twofold, to produce \relectricity for McMurdo in the amount of 1.8 MW as well as to produce \rsteam to operate a desalination plant for the production fresh drinking \rwater in the amount of 14,000 gallons per day. [3]\n    With a total of 438 malfunctions during its \roperational lifetime from 1964 to 1972, the reactor at McMurdo proved to \rbe an unreliable source of power generation, available only 72% of the \rtime. [1] Because of this, in May of 1972, it was determined by an \rindependent assessment from the Bechtel Corporation that the PM-3A was \rnot cost effective and that replacement with modern diesel-electric \rgenerators would require less staff and would also be more reliable. [1] \rIn September 1972, the PM-3A was shut down for routine maintenance and \rinspection. [1] It was determined that conditions existed in the system \rfor chloride stress corrosion cracking, a situation where sudden failure \rcan occur in normally ductile materials under tension in a corrosive \renvironment. [1,6] Inspection of a an accessible section of pipe \rrevealed no incidences of this occurring, however, the Navy refused to \rrule out cracking on surfaces which could not be inspected and thus \rcalled for a full dismantling and inspection of the reactor before it \rcould be deemed safe. [1] The cost associated with this full inspection \rand possible repair of reactor components was a major factor in the \rdecision to decommission the plant. [1]\n    After 10 years of operation, the PM-3A was \rpermanently shut down in 1972, achieving only half of the expected \rdesign life of 20 years. [1] The next step was clean up of the reactor \rsite. The PM-3A and generated radioactive waste could not remain at \rMcMurdo due to the internationally agreed upon Antarctic Treaty which \rprevents both nuclear weapons testing as well as nuclear waste dumping \rin the Antarctic. [7] As such, a large-scale effort was undertaken to \rremove the reactor components, buildings, and contaminated soil for a \rtotal of 365 metric tons of radioactive waste to the continental United \rStates. [7] It was later determined that there were indeed cracks in the \rcontainment vessel which leaked coolant water into the crushed gravel \rthat had been used as the reactor shield which is what resulted in such \ra large area of contamination. [4] As such, more than 9000 cubic meters \rof contaminated soil was relocated to the continental US. [1] In total, \rseven enriched uranium fuel cores were shipped to McMurdo, three of \rwhich had yet to be used as the plant was expected to operate for \rseveral more years. [7] The reactor cores, components, and highly \rradioactive gravel that was used to shield the reactor were shipped to \rthe Department of Energy Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. [1] The \rremaining low-level contaminated soil was shipped to the Naval base at \rPort Hueneme, California. [1] The clean up operation lasted until 1979 \ras work on the site could be performed only during the austral summer. \r[7]\n    As a result of the multiple malfunctions of the PM-3A \ras well as it&#39;s clean up activities, there have been concerns that the \rhealth of personnel involved with the reactor may have been adversely \raffected. [7] Although members of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Unit were \rcontinuously monitored for radiation, many of the military support crew \rwere not. [7] As such, a study was undertaken by the Department of \rDefense to estimate an upper bound on radiation exposure for these \rindividuals based on the worst cases of the available data from McMurdo. \r[7] Levels of radioactivity in the water were monitored once the PM-3A \rwas used in the production of drinking water. [7] During the first few \ryears of fresh water production (between 1967 and 1969) there were \rseveral instances of abnormally high amounts of tritium in the drinking \rwater. [7] In addition, there was a case of abnormally high amounts of \rlong-lived beta activity in the drinking water in 1969. [7]\n    In addition to problems with the drinking water and \renvironmental contamination, there were several recorded instances of \rcrew radiation exposure, some resulting in injury. [7] During the plant \roperation, 223 reports of abnormal levels of radiation were recorded. \r[7] Of these cases, 14 resulted in injury and 123 resulted in exposure \rin the amount of 0.350 rem over a period of 7 days. [7] This is a \rsubstantial amount of radiation when it is estimated that, one average, \ra typical yearly dose from background sources is 0.240 rem. [8] The \rremaining 86 instances were abnormal radiation levels detected within \rthe plant and its immediate surroundings. [7] The conclusion was that a \rsupport member would have received a maximum dose of 0.2 to 0.6 rem to \rthe thyroid or 0.2 to 0.5 rem to the red bone marrow per austral summer \rtour. [7] The upper bound here is equivalent a typical radiation dosage \rreceived by a person living in the United States from typical background \rradiation and medical procedures. [7] It is, however, recognized that \rthere were personnel who may have been exposed to radiation outside the \rconfines of factors and data considered in those figures that may be \religible for compensation. [7] In addition, the estimated dose above \rdoes not include members who were part of the decommissioning procedures \rwho may have inhaled or ingested contaminated particles. [7]\n    The nuclear reactor installed at McMurdo Station was \rthe first and only to operate on the Antarctic continent. It operated \rfor 10 years and greatly reduced the need for fossil fuels in the \rAntarctic. Although it was initially thought to be a cost saving device, \rits unreliability, large operational crew, and large clean up proved it \rto be an expensive experiment.
