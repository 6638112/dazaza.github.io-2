According to reporting and data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, more than 7,000 individuals from nearly 2,000 public agencies nationwide have used Clearview AI to search through millions of Americans’ faces, looking for people, including Black Lives Matter protesters, Capitol insurrectionists, petty criminals, and their own friends and family members.</p><p>专门用于警务的争议面部识别工具已经在全国范围内悄然部署，几乎没有公众监督。根据BuzzFeed新闻审查的报告和数据，全国近2,000名公共机构的7,000多人使用了Clearview Ai来搜索数百万美国人的面孔，寻找人们，包括黑人生活抗议者，国会议会起义主义者，小罪犯和他们自己的朋友和家人。</p><p> BuzzFeed News has  developed a searchable table of 1,803 publicly funded agencies whose employees are listed in the data as having used or tested the controversial policing tool before February 2020. These include local and state police, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Air Force, state healthcare organizations, offices of state attorneys general, and even public schools.</p><p> Buzzfeed新闻已开发出一个可搜索的表1,803个公共资助的机构，其员工在2月2020年2月之前使用或测试了有争议的警务工具的数据。这些包括当地和州警察，美国移民和海关执法，空军，州医疗组织，国家律师的办公室，甚至公立学校。</p><p> In many cases, leaders at these agencies were unaware that employees were using the tool; five said they would pause or ban its use in response to questions about it.</p><p> 在许多情况下，这些机构的领导人没有意识到员工使用该工具;五表示他们会暂停或禁止其使用以回应有关它的问题。</p><p> Our reporting is based on data that describes facial recognition searches conducted on Clearview AI between 2018 and February 2020, as well as tens of thousands of pages of public records, and outreach to every one of the hundreds of taxpayer-funded agencies included in the dataset.</p><p> 我们的报告基于数据描述于2018年至2020年2月至2020年间在ClearView AI上进行的面部识别搜索，以及数万页的公共记录，以及数据集中包含的数百名纳税人资助机构的每一个纳税人。</p><p>    The data, provided by a source who declined to be named for fear of retribution, has limitations. When asked about it in March of this year, Clearview AI did not confirm or dispute its authenticity. Some 336 public entities in the dataset confirmed to BuzzFeed News that their employees had tested or worked with the software, while 210 organizations denied any use. Most entities — 1,160 — did not respond to questions about whether they had used it.</p><p>    由拒绝被命名为恐惧报复的来源提供的数据具有局限性。当在今年3月询问时，ClearView AI没有确认或争取其真实性。 DataSet中的大约336个公共实体已确认为BuzzFeed新闻，他们的员工已经测试或与软件合作，而210个组织否认任何使用。大多数实体 -  1,160  - 没有回答关于他们是否已经使用过的问题。</p><p> Still, the data indicates that Clearview has broadly distributed its facial recognition software to federal agencies and police departments nationwide, offering the app to thousands of police officers and government employees, who at times used it without training or oversight. Often, agencies that acknowledged their employees had used the software confirmed it happened without the knowledge of their superiors, let alone the public they serve.</p><p> 尽管如此，该数据表明，ClarWive将其面部识别软件广泛分发给全国各国的联邦机构和警察部门，为该应用程序提供成千上万的警察和政府雇员，有时在没有培训或监督的情况下使用它。通常，承认其员工的机构已经使用该软件确认它在没有上级知识的情况下发生了，更不用说他们服务的公众。</p><p>    Such widespread use of Clearview means that facial recognition may have been used in your hometown with very few people knowing about it.</p><p>    这种广泛使用明智意味着面部识别可能已在您的家乡中使用，很少有人知道它。 </p><p> In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Hoan Ton-That, the company’s cofounder and CEO, said it was “gratifying to see how quickly Clearview AI has been embraced by US law enforcement.” He declined to answer more than 50 detailed questions about the company&#39;s practices and relationships with law enforcement agencies.</p><p>在Buzzfeed新闻，Hoan Ton  - 这是公司的CoFounder和CEO的声明中，表示这是“令人欣慰的清除扫视艾美执法迅速。”他拒绝回答有关该公司的50多个详细问题和与执法机构的实践和关系。</p><p> “Americans shouldn’t have to rely on BuzzFeed to learn their local law enforcement agencies were using flawed facial recognition technology,” Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, told BuzzFeed News. “This report pulls back the curtain on Clearview’s shady campaign to encourage the secret adoption of its service by local police. Inaccurate facial recognition will inevitably cause innocent people to be wrongly accused and convicted of crimes and could very well lead to tragedies.”</p><p> “美国人不应该依靠Buzzfeed来学习他们的当地执法机构正在使用有缺陷的面部识别技术，”俄勒冈州民主党罗恩·威登，告诉Buzzfeed新闻。 “此报告拉回清晰度的阴暗活动的窗帘，以鼓励当地警察秘密通过其服务。不准确的面部承认将不可避免地导致无辜的人被错误地指责并被判犯有罪行，并且可以很好地导致悲剧。“</p><p>    For years, law enforcement agencies have experimented with facial recognition, a technology that promises to help identify people of interest by matching surveillance photos to known images — such as a headshot from a driver’s license or passport. But there are several barriers to its adoption, including  high costs,  unreliable results, and  public opposition.</p><p>    多年来，执法机构已经尝试了面部认可，这是一项承诺通过将监控照片与已知图像相匹配 - 例如来自驾驶执照或护照的爆头来帮助识别兴趣的人们。但是，采用有几个障碍，包括高成本，效果不可靠和公众反对。</p><p> Clearview has pushed its technology into the mainstream with a product it claims is both more accurate and cost-effective than those of its competitors. For a time, it made the tool accessible via a free trial to almost any law enforcement officer who wanted to sign up.</p><p> ClearView已将其技术推入主流的产品，其产品均声称比其竞争对手更准确和成本效益。一时间，它使工具通过免费试验来访问几乎任何想要注册的执法人员。</p><p> “I found this site on a law enforcement web site last year, I set up an account to see if it worked,” Adrian Williams, police chief in Wilson’s Mills, North Carolina, wrote to BuzzFeed News in December 2020.</p><p> “我去年在执法网站上找到了这个网站，我设立了一个账户，看看它是否有效，”威尔逊·米尔斯（北卡罗来纳州）北卡罗来纳州的警察局长在2020年12月写信给Buzzfeed新闻。</p><p> If you have information about Clearview AI, or other facial recognition technology used by law enforcement, please email us at tips@buzzfeed.com. Or, to reach us securely, see  this page.</p><p> 如果您有关于ColleView AI或法律执行所使用的其他面部识别技术的信息，请在TIPS@BuzzFeed.com上发送给我们。或者，安全地联系我们，请参阅此页面。</p><p> Williams said he had tested Clearview AI using his own personal photos, but the software returned no matches. “I ran two known persons to see if they came back with any useful info. I didn’t think it worked the way the ad said it would,” he said.</p><p> 威廉姆斯表示，他已经使用自己的个人照片测试了ClearView Ai，但该软件返回没有匹配。 “我跑了两个已知的人，看他们是否回到任何有用的信息。他说，我不认为它的工作方式是，“他说。 </p><p> The New York City–based startup claims to have amassed one of the largest-known repositories of pictures of people’s faces — a database of more than 3 billion images scraped without permission from places such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. If you’ve posted images online, your social media profile picture, vacation snapshots, or family photos may well be part of a facial recognition dragnet that’s been tested or used by law enforcement agencies across the country.</p><p>纽约市的创业公司声称已经拥有了人们面临的最大的储存库之一 - 一个超过3亿张图片的数据库，无需Facebook，Instagram和LinkedIn等地方。如果您已在线发布图像，您的社交媒体概况图片，假期快照或家庭照片可能是面部识别龙的一部分，该判断在全国范围内的执法机构进行了测试或使用。</p><p>    Data analyzed by BuzzFeed News indicated that individuals at some 1,803 agencies — which were all contacted and asked whether they had ever used Clearview — ran almost 340,000 searches. Based on conversations with people who have used the software, a Clearview search may include a demonstration scan at a trade show, a police officer looking up a colleague as a test, or an actual investigative attempt to find a person of interest. While this database represents only a snapshot of Clearview’s reach as of February 2020, it provides unprecedented insight into how facial recognition technology can spread through law enforcement agencies across the country.</p><p>    Buzzfeed新闻分析的数据表明，在约1,803个机构的个人 - 全部联系并询问他们是否曾经使用过ClearView  - 跑了近340,000名搜索。基于与使用该软件的人的对话，清除视图搜索可能包括贸易展的演示扫描，警察查询同事作为考试，或者实际的调查试图找到一个兴趣人士。虽然该数据库仅代表了截至2020年2月的ClearView的范围，但它提供了前所未有的深入了解面部识别技术如何通过全国范围内的执法机构传播。</p><p> Smaller police departments were among Clearview’s earliest users. Officials in Mountain Brook, Alabama, which has a population of about 20,000, tested the product and ran nearly 590 searches. In Illinois, the secretary of state’s office ran nearly 8,900 searches, telling BuzzFeed News that the software was used “to assist other law enforcement agencies in their investigations.”</p><p> 小型警察部门是明确的最早用户之一。阿拉巴马州山区山区官员大约有20,000人的人口，测试了该产品，并跑了近590次搜寻。在伊利诺伊州，国务卿办公室跑了近8,900名搜查，告诉Buzzfeed新闻，该软件被用来“协助其他执法机构进行调查”。</p><p> A police department crime analyst in Leawood, Kansas, tried Clearview thanks to a recommendation from a peer, only to discover another detective had already been using the software, a spokesperson said. The two officers ran 50 searches before the department decided it didn’t want to buy the product. The Wyoming Highway Patrol gave Clearview a go for about three weeks last February, Sgt. Jeremy Beck said.</p><p> 发言人表示，由于同行的建议，堪萨斯州利伍德，堪萨斯州的警察局犯罪分析师试图ClearView，这是一个侦探已经使用该软件已经使用该软件。两名官员在部门决定不想购买产品之前进行50次搜索。怀俄明高速公路巡逻队在去年2月举行了大约三周的明确观点。杰里米·贝克说。</p><p> Even representatives at Washington’s Department of Fish and Wildlife and Minnesota’s Commerce Fraud Bureau confirmed to BuzzFeed News that individuals within their organizations tested the software. A spokesperson for Iowa’s public defender’s office said people used it “to better understand how law enforcement might use it.”</p><p> 甚至华盛顿鱼类和野生动物部和明尼苏达州商业欺诈局的代表甚至是Buzzfeed的新闻，其组织内的个人测试了该软件。一位为爱荷华州的公共卫生员办公室的发言人表示，人们使用它“更好地了解法律执法可能会使用它。”</p><p> Following an inquiry from BuzzFeed News, the Washington National Guard’s Counterdrug Program found that an instructor at its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center had not only registered to use Clearview’s facial recognition software without permission but had also incorporated it into the curriculum for an officer training course. This course was open to “federal, state, local and tribal law enforcement,” per emails obtained by BuzzFeed News through a public records request.</p><p> 在Buzzfeed新闻的询问之后，华盛顿国民卫队的反驳计划发现，其西部地区计金公司培训中心的教练不仅在未经许可的情况下注册使用ClearView的面部识别软件，而且还将其纳入了官员培训课程的课程。本课程对“联邦，州，地方和部落执法”开放，通过BuzzFeed新闻通过公共记录请求获得的电子邮件。</p><p>    “Any mention of this software has now been stripped from our training materials,” said Karina Shagren, communications director for Washington’s military department. “And we’re now conducting a top-down review of all training programs.”</p><p>    “现在已经提到了这款软件的培训材料，”华盛顿军事署通讯总监Karina Shagren说。 “我们现在正在对所有培训计划进行自上而下的审查。” </p><p> Clearview’s promotional materials and communications with law enforcement agencies were obtained via  more than 140 public records requests from BuzzFeed News. The documents detail the startup’s flood-the-market strategy, in which it hawked free trials of its technology to seemingly anyone with an email address associated with the government or a law enforcement agency and told them to “ run wild.&#34; The data shows that this marketing push put an  unproven and federally unregulated facial recognition tool into the hands of people associated with taxpayer-funded agencies in the District of Columbia, the US Virgin Islands, and every state except Vermont.</p><p>ClearView的宣传材料和与执法机构的沟通通过来自BuzzFeed新闻的超过140个公共记录请求获得。该文件详细说明了启动的洪水市场策略，其中它可以免费试用其技术，似乎有人有与政府或执法机构相关联的电子邮件地址，并告诉他们“狂奔。这些营销推动该营销推动将未经证实和联邦未经监测的面部识别工具纳入与哥伦比亚特区，美国维尔京群岛和佛蒙特州以外的每个州的纳税人资助机构的人员手中。</p><p> After March 2020, according to emails obtained via a public records request, Clearview placed a few checks on its free trial program, including the requirement of a superior&#39;s approval and appointment of an administrator to monitor use. Clearview’s website was also updated last month  to state that officers have to provide a case number before conducting a search.</p><p> 在2020年3月之后，根据通过公共记录请求获得的电子邮件，ClearView对其免费试用计划进行了一些支票，包括优越的要求和＃39; S批准和任用管理员以监控使用。 ClearView的网站上个月也更新，以说明官员必须在进行搜索之前提供案例编号。</p><p> But between summer 2019 and February 2020, none of these checks existed. Any officer could sign up, and Clearview explicitly encouraged them to test its software on friends and family members.</p><p> 但在2019年夏季和2020年2月之间，这些检查都没有存在。任何官员可以注册，明确鼓励他们在朋友和家庭成员上测试其软件。</p><p> “No strings attached,” a November 2019 email to police in Lakeland, Florida, reads. “It only takes one minute to install and you can start searching immediately.”</p><p> 2019年11月11月在佛罗里达州Lakeland的警察发送给警察的“没有条纹”，读。 “它只需要一分钟才能安装，您可以立即开始搜索。”</p><p> In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Ton-That said that in two years the company had helped “thousands of agencies” solve crimes including “child exploitation, financial fraud, and murder,” but did not provide specific examples when asked.</p><p> 在对Buzzfeed新闻的陈述中，吨 - 这表示，在两年内，该公司已经帮助了“成千上万的机构”解决犯罪，包括“儿童剥削，金融欺诈和谋杀”，但在被问及时没有提供具体的例子。</p><p> “As a young startup, we’re proud of our record of accomplishment and will continue to refine our technology, cybersecurity, and compliance protocols,” he said. “We also look forward to working with policymakers on best practices to forge a proper balance between privacy and security that serves the interests of families and communities across America.”</p><p> “作为一个年轻的初创公司，我们为我们的成就记录感到自豪，并将继续改善我们的技术，网络安全和合规协议，”他说。 “我们还期待着与政策制定者合作，以最佳实践，以促进隐私和保安之间的适当平衡，这些私密性和安全性地为美国家庭和社区的利益。”</p><p>    Created by Ton-That, an Australian-born college dropout who  traveled in  far-right circles, Clearview AI debuted in 2017 as SmartCheckr, a tool for  tracking people across disparate social media platforms. With funding from Facebook board member Peter Thiel, the company changed its name a year later when it began focusing on facial recognition.</p><p>    由TON创建的澳大利亚出生的大学辍学者在右右圈，Clearview AI在2017年作为SmartCheckr进行首次亮相，该工具是一种跟踪各种社交媒体平台的人。通过Facebook董事会成员彼得·泰尔的资金，该公司在开始关注面部识别时，每年稍后更改其名称。 </p><p> Clearview has touted its software as the “world’s best facial-recognition technology,” but its most novel innovation is doing what no other company has been willing to do: rip billions of personal photos from social media and the web without permission or consent.</p><p>ClearView将其软件推出为“世界上最好的面部识别技术”，但其最具新颖的创新正在做任何其他公司愿意做的：在未经许可或同意的情况下从社交媒体和网络中划分数十亿个个人照片。</p><p> In his statement, Ton-That compared Clearview to a search engine and said the facial recognition tool only searches public information available on the internet. “The work we do is fully protected by the First Amendment and complies with all applicable laws,” he said.</p><p> 在他的陈述中，吨 - 将ClearView与搜索引擎进行比较，并表示面部识别工具仅在互联网上搜索可用的公共信息。 “我们所做的工作受到第一个修正案的完全保护，并遵守所有适用的法律，”他说。</p><p>  “Protecting privacy means maintaining control of private information that is most revealing of our identities, our activities, our selfhood, and Clearview’s business is based on taking that control away from people without their consent,” Nathan Freed Wessler, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, told BuzzFeed News. “You can change your Social Security number if it is taken without your consent, but you can’t change your face.”</p><p>  “保护隐私意味着维持对大多数揭示我们身份，我们的活动，自我和清除观点的私人信息的控制是基于在未经他们同意的情况下远离人民的控制，”内森释放Wessler是一名高级员工律师ACLU告诉Buzzfeed新闻。 “如果没有您的同意，您可以更改您的社会安全号码，但您无法改变脸部。”</p><p>    Last May, the  ACLU sued Clearview for allegedly violating an Illinois law overseeing the collection of biometric data by private companies. The company is also facing multidistrict litigation for the sale of its technology in Illinois — an alleged violation of a state biometric privacy law — a suit from the Vermont attorney general, and a  suit from Latinx and Chicanx rights group Mijente.  Facebook,  LinkedIn,  Google,  and Twitter have all sent Clearview cease-and-desist letters alleging that the company violated its terms of service by scraping people’s data. (All four companies declined to say if they have plans to take further legal action against Clearview.)</p><p>    最后5月，ACLU据称违反了私营公司收集生物识别数据收集的伊利诺伊州法律。该公司还面临着伊利诺伊州销售其技术的多渠道诉讼 - 据称违反了国家生物识别隐私法 - 佛蒙特州一般司机的诉讼，以及拉丁裔和芝坦克斯权利集团Mijente的诉讼。 Facebook，LinkedIn，Google和Twitter都有所有已发送的ClearView停止信件，声称该公司通过刮掉人们的数据违反其服务条款。 （所有四家公司都拒绝说，如果他们有计划采取进一步的法律诉讼。）</p><p> None of this has hampered Clearview’s aggressive marketing efforts toward law enforcement. The company regularly promoted itself to email lists of officers with  claims that its software can scan “over 1 billion faces in less than a second&#34; and that it is “100% accurate across all demographic groups.&#34;</p><p> 这一切都没有阻碍ClearView对执法的侵略性营销努力。该公司定期向索赔提供给官员的电子邮件列表，其中软件可以扫描其扫描超过10亿面的＆＃34;并且它在所有人口组中的100％准确。＆＃34;</p><p> This strategy has worked brilliantly. By February 2020, almost 2,000 taxpayer-funded entities and police departments across the US had at least one person run at least one search with Clearview, according to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News. The company assured those users in marketing emails that the more searches they ran, the  more likely they were to match a suspect.</p><p> 这一战略已经辉煌了。于2020年2月，据BuzzFeed新闻的数据根据​​数据审查的数据，近2,000名纳税人资助的实体和警察部门至少有一个人使用ClearView进行了至少一个搜索。该公司向这些用户提供营销电子邮件，这些电子邮件更多的搜索越多，他们就越有可能与嫌疑人相匹配。</p><p>  “Their claims of near-perfect identification have never been substantiated, and the pervasive tracking of our faces and whereabouts with a flawed technology is just too dangerous to have in the hands of the government,” he said.</p><p>  “他们的近乎完美识别的索赔从未得到证实，而普遍的追踪我们的面部和下落与缺陷的技术在政府手中太危险，”他说。 </p><p>    In recent years, Clearview reached hundreds of law enforcement agencies by using a sales strategy commonplace among software companies like Slack or Dropbox. Rather than rely on standard procurement channels to make a sale, it also targeted individual employees with free trials. That allowed Clearview to create internal demand in a bottom-up manner with the hope that users would advocate within their departments to move to a paid version.</p><p>近年来，ClearView通过使用像松弛或Dropbox这样的软件公司中的销售战略普遍达到数百名执法机构。它而不是依靠标准采购渠道进行销售，它还针对具有免费试验的个别员工。允许ClearView以自下而上的方式创建内部需求，希望用户能够在其部门内提倡到付费版本。</p><p> These free trials have helped Clearview create a broad swath of connections with local police officers; Ton-That recently claimed that  3,100 law enforcement agencies have used the software as of March 2021. Listed in the data BuzzFeed reviewed, for example, were more than 40 individuals in the New York Police Department who had collectively run over 11,000 searches — the most of any entity as of February 2020. The NYPD announced  new facial recognition policies in March 2020 following a BuzzFeed News story that detailed  how it used the software.</p><p> 这些免费试验有助于ClearView与当地警察建立了广泛的联系;吨 - 最近声称，3,100名执法机构使用了截至3月2021年3月的软件。例如，在纽约警察局的纽约警察局审查的数据中列出了纽约警察局的40多人，其中最多截至2020年2月的任何实体。诺维德在一个BuzzFeed新闻故事之后，3月2020年3月宣布了新的面部识别政策，详细说明它如何使用该软件。</p><p> The New York State Police ran more than 5,100 searches and used the software “to generate potential leads in criminal investigations as well as homeland security cases involving a clearly identified public safety issue,” according to Beau Duffy, director of public information. The data lists other police departments that have run more than 4,000 searches as of February 2020: Bergen County Sheriff’s Office in New Jersey (more than 7,800), Indiana State Police (more than 5,700), Broward County Sheriff’s Office in Florida (more than 6,300), and Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana (nearly 4,200). Indiana State Police confirmed its use of Clearview. The Broward County and Jefferson Parish offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A Bergen County Sheriff spokesperson denied the agency used Clearview.</p><p> 纽约州警察率先搜索了5,100多个搜索，并使用该软件“在公共信息总监Beau Duffy涉及明确确定的公共安全问题的国土安全案件”以产生潜在的潜力。“该数据列出了截至2月2020年2月的其他警察局，截至2020年2月：卑尔根县警长办公室（超过7,800多），印第安纳州警察（超过5,700），布罗沃德郡佛罗里达州警长办公室（超过6,300 ）和杰斐逊教区警长在路易斯安那州的办公室（近4,200）。印第安纳州警方证实了它使用明确观点。 Broward County和Jefferson Parish Offices没有回应多种评论请求。卑尔根县警长发言人否认了代理商使用ClearView。</p><p> According to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News, individuals at 15 different state attorneys general offices tried the software, including those in Texas, Alabama, and New Jersey, which banned its own law enforcement agencies from using it in January 2020. The Texas attorney general’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment, while a spokesperson for the Alabama attorney general’s office said it “had no contracts with Clearview AI.”</p><p> 根据Buzzfeed新闻审查的数据，15个不同的州律师将军的个人试图该软件，包括德克萨斯州德克萨斯州，阿拉巴马州和新泽西州的软件，该软件禁止其自身执法机构于2020年1月在德克萨斯州授权书没有回应多个评论请求，而阿拉巴马州律师的办公室的发言人表示，它“没有与ClearView Ai合同。”</p><p>    When BuzzFeed News notified the California attorney general’s office of accounts tied to its employees, a spokesperson said the state’s Department of Justice had “not authorized the use of facial recognition software.” The department subsequently blocked access to Clearview’s website on employees’ devices, the spokesperson added, “out of an abundance of caution.”</p><p>    当Buzzfeed新闻通知加州律师将军委托人与员工界的账户办公室表示，该发言人表示，该州的司法部“未授权使用面部识别软件”。发言人补充说，该部门随后阻止了对员工设备上的ClearView的网站的访问权限，“出于丰富的谨慎”。</p><p> Individuals associated with public schools have also apparently tried the company’s facial recognition software. As of early 2020, data reviewed by BuzzFeed News lists 31 public community colleges and universities — including the University of Alabama and West Virginia University, neither of which responded to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for California State University, Long Beach, confirmed a detective had reviewed the platform’s capabilities on a 30-day trial.</p><p> 与公立学校相关的个人也显然也试过公司的面部识别软件。截至2020年初，Buzzfeed新闻列出了31份公共社区学院和大学 - 包括阿拉巴马大学和西弗吉尼亚大学，这两者都不回应多种评论要求。加州州立大学长滩的发言人确认了侦探在30天的试验中审查了平台的能力。</p><p> Records seen by BuzzFeed News show that individuals associated with two high schools —  Somerset Berkley Regional High School in Massachusetts and Central Montco Technical High School in Pennsylvania — and Texas’s Katy Independent School District appear to have run searches.</p><p> Buzzfeed新闻显示的记录显示，与两所高中相关的个人 - 宾夕法尼亚州马萨诸塞州和蒙科市中心高中的萨默塞特伯克利区域高中 - 和德克萨斯州的Katy独立学区似乎已经开始搜索。 </p><p> Officials at Central Montco Technical High School did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Somerset Police Department, which is tied to Somerset Berkley Regional High, according to data seen by BuzzFeed News, confirmed that a detective had used Clearview on a 30-day trial.

And to some extent these claims were born out in BuzzFeed News’ reporting.</p><p> 在营销陈述中，ClearView声称其软件已被用于帮助识别子捕食者。在某种程度上，这些索赔诞生于BuzzFeed新闻的报告中。</p><p> ICE — as well as police in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, and Raleigh, North Carolina — told BuzzFeed News the software had been used in such cases. “Clearview AI is most often used to investigate formidable crimes that are extraordinary in nature, such as reports of human trafficking and shootings,” said Laura Hourigan, a spokesperson for the Raleigh Police Department. “These searches are fairly narrow in their scope, are limited, and are focused specifically on what they are looking for at that time.”</p><p> 冰 - 以及北卡罗来纳州斯佩森特，威斯康星州和罗利的警察 - 告诉Buzzfeed新闻该软件已被用于这种情况。 “ClearView AI最常用于调查自然界非凡的强大罪行，例如人口贩运和射击的报告，”罗利警察局的发言人Laura Hotigan说。 “这些搜索在其范围内相当缩小，有限，专门专注于当时他们正在寻找的东西。”</p><p> Ton-That told BuzzFeed News that law enforcement agencies have also used Clearview to identify insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6, though he declined to provide specifics.

Individuals associated with the departments of Justice, Defense, and State have all apparently tried the facial recognition software, according to data reviewed by BuzzFeed News. Spokespeople for those departments declined or did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>    ClearView的免费试验，其中大部分提供用户无限制的搜索30天，也可能有助于将其软件放在全国最大的执法机构中许多最大的执法机构的员工手中。根据BuzzFeed新闻的数据审查的数据，与司法部门，防御和国家部门相关的个人显然已经尝试了面部识别软件。这些部门的发言人拒绝或没有回复评论要求。</p><p> The data lists people at the five largest branches of the US military — the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines — as having used the company’s software.
