use Quad9 normally, no data containing your IP address is ever logged in any Quad9 system. Connections can employ encryption if your system supports it, and the entire Quad9 platform has been designed to be GDPR-compliant from the first public announcement in 2017.\n  Every transaction on the Internet starts with a DNS event. This name lookup reveals critically sensitive data about the person triggering that transaction. The nature of those name lookups has created a strong and dangerous motivation for commercialization of personal data from DNS recursive resolver services. Quad9 is the only large DNS resolver with a founding charter that includes privacy as a primary goal, and the Quad9 team is devoted to the concept of keeping personal data under the control of the end user.\n  Quad9\u2019s organizational move to Switzerland is important for the free and open internet because it provides much-needed geographic and legal diversity in the open DNS resolver space. It also shows that Quad9 is actively seeking to work within the legislative framework that best serves the privacy of its users.I support the Quad9 open resolver because it puts the end user first and helps build a secure and private internet without collecting \u2013 and therefore without the possibility of commercializing \u2013 users\u2019 personal information. I believe Quad9\u2019s philosophy of openness and transparency in handling users\u2019 data resonates strongly with the core beliefs of our community.\u201d\n I\u2019m really impressed by the privacy architecture of Quad9. In addition to providing great security as a DNS resolver, Quad9 doesn\u2019t collect or retain personal data. Now, it is relocating to Switzerland, where it will become subject to the rigors of Swiss data protection law, which is similar to GDPR. In addition, it obtained findings of law from the Swiss government whereby it won\u2019t be required to retain personal information, nor will it be subject to requests from law enforcement or national security\u201d\n  Quad9 routes your DNS queries through a secure network of servers around the globe. The system uses threat intelligence from more than a dozen of the industry\u2019s leading cybersecurity companies to give a real-time perspective on what websites are safe and what sites are known to include malware or other threats. If the system detects that the site you want to reach is known to be infected, you\u2019ll automatically be blocked from entry \u2013 keeping your data and computer safe.\n  For the Internet to be an effective tool, users must trust their ability to use online services without fear of theft, fraud, or misuse of their devices by criminals. Public and private network operators need protection against malicious use of infrastructure resources and attacks against their users or customers. Quad9\u2019s mission is to improve the security and stability of the Internet to allow everyone to be less vulnerable to risks and more effective in their daily online interactions.\n  Quad9 can be used simply by setting the DNS server settings for your device to the addresses given in  one of our service profiles. No sign-up is required, no account data needs to be given to Quad9, and there is no contract. Quad9 is free to use and collects no personal data about you. You can configure your router or wifi access point to distribute these settings, which will extend protection to all the elements on your local network including IoT devices, many of which otherwise would not have any anti-malware defenses.\n  Quad9 is a not-for-profit organization, relying on grants and partnerships with commercial and non-commercial sources and from individuals. Your use of Quad9 may prevent a ransomware attack, prevent your bank account from being compromised, or protect your laptop from being used as part of an illicit criminal attack on others.

The family said their thermostat had been changed remotely, raising the temperature of their home during a three-hour \u201cenergy saving event.\u201d\n  The family\u2019s smart thermostat was installed a few years ago as part of a new home security package. Many smart thermostats can be enrolled in a program called &#34;Smart Savers Texas.&#34; It&#39;s operated by a company called  EnergyHub.\n  The agreement states that in exchange for an entry into sweepstakes, electric customers allow them to control their thermostats during periods of high energy demand.

There was a time and a place for me to play the punditry game with Apple, but I feel like that was years ago in a much different time and place. I spent 17 years at Apple, and boy, do I have opinions about the place, both how it was and how it is, but I also sometimes remind myself it was almost that long ago that I left, and things change. I changed.\u00a0  Does the world need one more Apple pundit? God, no, there are so many people with so many opinions I mostly sit on the sidelines and don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the time to try to get heard above the noisy of the mob that circles around Apple with their endless hot takes. (To answer a question I get every so often: the way I stay up to date on Apple these days is I pay attention to what Jason and Dan write at  Sixcolors.com, and what Jason and Myke talk about on the  Upgrade podcast. They connect me to basically everything I feel I should know about with Apple, and give me good, thoughtful opinions about the things they discuss and point to.\u00a0  I am still very much embedded in that ecosystem, and I have never seriously considered doing anything else, and I at this point never expect to. I depended on my iPhone even when I was working and evangelizing a phone that wanted to pretend it was competing with Apple (but honestly, we never really did). That doesn&#39;t mean I love, or even like, everything Apple does. But mostly I think Apple is doing good things, most of the time.\u00a0   The Apple Silicon Transition  One thing I think Apple is doing very well: the transition to Apple Silicon (aka the ARM chips). I replaced my fairly recent Apple 16&#34; Macbook Pro with the M1 Macbook Air, and it works wonderfully well. As someone who lived through the 68K -&gt; PowerPC transition, was leaving Apple in the early days of the PowerPC -&gt; Intel transition, and for good measure had to survive the Classic MacOS -&gt; MacOSX transition, I&#39;ve seen this floorshow before. Apple is knocking this one out of the park.\u00a0  In day to day use, the M1 laptop blows away the 16&#34; pro -- which I loved and which Laurie now has and uses. There are a few places where it&#39;s consumer designs appear, and the one way I can systematically drag it down to a crawl is by telling Lightroom to do multiple compute intensive things at once: for instance, a common operation for me is to import a bunch of photos, then set up Lightroom to convert them all to DNG, and build 1:1 and Smart profiles for each. The 16&#34; handles this load fine; the M1 slogs and struggles, because Adobe makes no attempt to recognize overload conditions and self-throttle. If I do them serially, all is fine, but multiple, independent compute intensive threads can kick the computer in the kneepcap.\u00a0  This doesn&#39;t bother me, because I expected it and it&#39;s avoidable with some thought (one might wish Adobe would make their background processing smarter, but, well, it&#39;s Adobe). And it&#39;s a great example of the difference between the higher end Intel chips in the Macbook pro, and the M1 Macbook air: the M1 is way better at 99% of what I use it for, but it has its limitations -- limitations which were obvious and expected, and limitations which will be removed when Apple brings out newer, more powerful chips.\u00a0  This is a place where I think many of the so-called pundits fell down in their discussions about Apple; they look at the M1 and complain about its limits, not seeming to understand this isn&#39;t the best Apple can do, it&#39;s the first that Apple did. The M1 is \u00a0a great entry level chip for good entry level systems, and a strong indication of what&#39;s possible in this new Apple Silicon era as Apple improves and matures its chips. If you follow a pundit that couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t see this basic idea, you really need to upgrade your pundits.\u00a0  So far, the software translation that allows Intel software to work has, well, just worked. It&#39;s been flawless. Way better than the first generation of Rosetta tools we lived with in previous transitions.  My plan, in fact, is when the rumored 30&#34; iMacs come out, with hopefully a more pro-sumer capable CPU (M1x or M2?) I&#39;ll be adding one to the clan and make that my primary computer, with my laptop going back to pure mobile use. We&#39;ll probably replace Laurie&#39;s iMac, also, and then at some point I&#39;ll likely upgrade back to a Macbook Pro and she&#39;ll get this M1 Air.\u00a0   Other Products  I love my iPhone, although once again, my &#34;plan&#34; to get serious about using it for photography has fallen victim to this &#34;I have no time to spare to invest in learning this&#34; thing. I like my iPad, but it is very much a consumption device for me, so I&#39;m not demanding more of it than it&#39;s able to offer me, and I fully agree with and support the people who complain about how much more limited the OS is than the hardware could potentially offer. I wonder why they put an M1 in an iPad, when to me, all it does is highlight how much less an iPad can do than my M1 Macbook can -- although there are various aspects of how I use an iPad where I much prefer it to my Mac. But the iPad is still trying to figure out how to be a mature platform, and in many ways, falling short. I also note I haven&#39;t touched my Apple Pencil since about a month after I bought it with my latest iPad model -- it just doesn&#39;t sync into how I work with the device.\u00a0  Yet. (see: &#34;this year, I&#39;m going to get serious about using iPhones in my photography&#34;)  I love my Apple Watch. First thing I do -- before getting out of bed in the morning -- is put it on. Last thing I do, as I sit on the edge of the bed, is take it off so it can charge. I struggle to find a watch face I love, but I have some I like, and that&#39;s more than good enough for someone like me. Rene Ritchie once said that the Apple Sports Band was the yoga pants of watchbands, and well, yes, I wear my watch with one of those bands 100% of the time, because it&#39;s nice and comfortable and that&#39;s what I want. Fashionista I am not, nor do I ever want to be...  Other Apple Hardware is less successful for me. I own a Homepod, and mostly, I forget it&#39;s there and I forget to tell my devices to send audio to it. If it were to fail, I wouldn&#39;t replace it. I was for a long time a big supporter of the Apple TV, but when the one in my office failed, I replaced it with a Roku. the only reason we still have an Apple TV in the house is because it hasn&#39;t failed yet, and we frankly never use it any more. Apple took this product down the wrong paths, and it&#39;s become irrelevant as far as I&#39;m concerned. And Earpods -- I just bought a new pair when my older pair finally became somewhere beyond unreliable and trending into broken. For the last couple of months, I&#39;ve been kind of down on them, but with a new pair that is working properly, I&#39;m a lot happier with them now. I did, in fact, buy a replacement pair, but I don&#39;t make them my only/default hearing device; I still prefer my Bose QC35&#39;s when I&#39;m in my office, and I use the earpods for phone calls and when I&#39;m mobile. I don&#39;t love wearing the earpods for multiple hours at a time, but that&#39;s probably my biggest complaint about them.  If I were to assign letter grades, how about these: Apple Silicon Macs A, Intel Macs B, iPads: B-, the iPhone a B+, Homepod gets a boring C, Apple TV gets a D, and Earpods get a B-. Overall, not bad results for Apple.   Software  When it comes to Apple&#39;s software, though, I have some bigger gripes. One of the big draws of App&#39;e&#39;s infrastructure is how apps can integrate and move data around between sets of related apps. Given that idea, though, why is it I feel like I&#39;m always looking for a better third party app than the standard Apple one? I&#39;m talking about apps like Mail, like Calendar and the Contacts app specifically.\u00a0  I currently use Spark as my mail client. It&#39;s been -- fine -- but I&#39;m about to shift back to the app I used before I was tired of it&#39;s glitches and moved to Spark, which is Airmail. I&#39;m shifting away from Spark because I&#39;m tired of its glitches and want to see if Airmail is less glitchy now. I&#39;m betting -- not. But still, I keep hoping.\u00a0  Apple Mail? I really want to like it. I don&#39;t dislike it, actually, and every so often I use it for a while, but it&#39;s missing some key features (like snooze) I&#39;d like to have, and it feels -- fine. It&#39;s a fine app that is also more or less forgettable.\u00a0  How to define how I feel about the Mail app? Remember back in high school or college that cute person you worked up the the nerve to ask out on a date, and they spent the entire evening looking disinterested and killing any attempt at conversation with one or two word answers and silences? That&#39;s Apple Mail to me; they&#39;re a nice person and all, but... there&#39;s nothing I feel like building a relationship around. I&#39;ve tried it enough times to know I don&#39;t want to try again unless Apple does something that really convinces me they&#39;ve spent time understanding what a modern mail app should be. I&#39;m not holding my breath. For a calendar I use  Fantastical, and love it and pay for it willingly. For contacts? Allow me to exhale a deep, loud sigh. I&#39;ve been using Busycontacts for a while, and it&#39;s -- it&#39;s fine, just like Apple Mail is fine. And the Fantastical people just bundled Cardhop with Fantastical, so I&#39;ve been working with it for the last week, and it&#39;s actually a pretty good app, but it works in ways I don&#39;t like, where I can honestly say &#34;it&#39;s not you it&#39;s me&#34;, so I&#39;ve uninstalled it again (for the third time). And since I can be equally uninspired by both Apple&#39;s Contacts app and Busycontacts, I&#39;ve decided it&#39;s time to go back to Apple&#39;s Contacts app again. (edit later: or more correctly, I tried for about an hour, and I&#39;m back with Busycontacts because there were just too many issues with the contacts app) For a while. Until I meet some new contacts app and take it out for a spin, hoping it&#39;ll actually do what I&#39;d like a Contacts app will do.\u00a0  These apps are a good example of an ongoing problem I think Apple hasn&#39;t taken seriously enough: they commit resources to build something and they promote that thing with marketing and keynotes and all of the hype -- and then many of those things get stuffed in a closet and mostly ignored year after year as the market moves forward and innovates. Apple Mail is a great example of a really good email app if it was ten years ago, and remember Apple&#39;s Airport wifi devices? Apple&#39;s long neglect of them is why I&#39;m a pretty happy user of Eero these days.\u00a0  But in the case of something like a mail app, Apple giving a basic app away for free inhibits other developers from tackling that idea, and limits their ability to make enough money to warrant doing the hard investment in doing a real killer version of an app of that type. I do wish Apple would choose to either commit hard to an app and make it best of show, or kill the app and open the market to other companies. Instead, they do a middle policy of doing minimal work on an adequate app, making it harder for non-Apple apps to thrive, but not really serving the needs of the users very well, either.\u00a0  Itunes -- oh, sorry, Apple Music -- is another app like this. A number of years ago I wrote a piece that described it as a dumpster fire. Now? It feels like a dumpster fire where Apple closed one half of the dumpster lids, declared victory and went off to design even more interesting iPhones instead.\u00a0  Apple, I think, has too many things they&#39;ve built and committed to market and not enough resources committed to properly maintain and push them forward. Whether it&#39;s the Apple Airports or the Apple TV, which I think Tim Cook should just retire and embrace the Apple TV software on other devices -- or software like Mail that goes years without any significant innovation -- there are parts of Apple&#39;s ecosystem that seem to go on idle for years at a time, and where Apple simply doesn&#39;t care enough or have enough resources to commit to doing those bits and pieces justice. And because of it, its users are not as well served as Apple users deserve to be.\u00a0  A side aspect of this &#34;benign neglect?&#34; thing I see is that software quality at Apple, which for years was rock solid, has become more hit and miss. I do believe Apple has figured this out and I do believe they&#39;re working on it -- but I also believe the results have been spotty. I&#39;m one of those people who still install updates when tehy&#39;re released -- for the most part, and maybe a few hours after the real early adopters have had a chance to bleed their edges first -- but I&#39;ve become more and more hesitant about that in the last few years. I should trust Apple&#39;s software quality, and for a long time I did, but now? I hesitate more, because I&#39;ve hit too many rough edges.\u00a0   The Podcast App and Paid Podcasts  Recently, Apple made a lot of noise about Podcasts and the Podcasts app. And you know what? If you look up &#34;adequate app&#34; in the dictionary, the Podcast app logo will be \u00a0there, because that&#39;s exactly what that app is. So since Apple seems to be getting serious about podcasts (finally), did they invest in making the podcast app great?\u00a0  No. They created a system of paid podcasts, which can be listened to only in their podcast app. They didn&#39;t innovate to an app you want to use, they built a service that tries to force you to use it. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good for those podcasters who choose to sign up for that service, and I don&#39;t expect that service to thrive or ever be a major player in podcasts -- and I don&#39;t think Apple has done its users any favors by playing this exclusive content game.\u00a0  It&#39;s an example of a bad trend I see out of Apple, a refusal to embrace and compete in existing market areas, but instead trying to use their existing ecosystem to force people into exclusive relationships with Apple. Almost as if they don&#39;t feel they can compete and win, so instead they attempt use their 800 pound gorilla status in some area to force us into doing it their way in others. And often, this blows up in their face, and it may be blowing up in their face big time right now, but we&#39;ll get to that shortly.\u00a0  It&#39;s an indication of an attitudinal shift in Apple I don&#39;t like: it&#39;s one thing to believe it can and should be the dominate player in a market, and when you turn out dominant products like the iPhone, you deserve to be. But increasingly, it seems Apple is shifting from &#34;we can be the biggest player in this market&#34; to &#34;we don&#39;t believe we should have any competitors in this market&#34;. And that trend really worries me and makes me less supportive of Apple in general.\u00a0   The App Store and Apple&#39;s developers  A bit of background seems to be in order. I went to work at Apple to help found a team known as the Direct Response Center. It&#39;s purpose was to act as paid tech support for the &#34;complex&#34; Apple products where &#34;call your dealer&#34; was Apple&#39;s support policy. That included initially Apple&#39;s A/UX Unix product, and later various other things as well. You&#39;ve likely never heard of A/UX, because this was the 68K era of Apple products and possibly before you were born, but that organization grew up, ultimately moved to Austin (without me) and you probably have heard the name of the organization it became, which is Applecare. Over the years, especially after I shifted over to IS&amp;T and became fully involved in building and running email things for Apple, I was involved in many parts of Apple in one way or another.\u00a0  After leaving Apple, I shifted into roles that were various parts of Community Management for outside developers and acting as the Developer Advocate within the company for those outside developers. Two of the companies I did this for were Palm (for the WebOS reboot attempt) and Cisco (when Susie Wee founded their Devnet team, which unlike Palm, has grown and succeeded wildly).\u00a0  At Palm I was involved in the launch of the app store and the developer programs, and I really came to learn and love the challenges of that role. I also really came to believe -- and argue for -- strong support for the independent developers, not just for the big development houses, because I believe that&#39;s where the new developers mature out of that go on to big things, and that&#39;s where the true innovation on a platform happens.\u00a0  Palm was a disaster on many levels and deserved to fail, but the core intentions were good and the plans we tried to implement were worth fighting for. I had always had a belief that the indie developers were vital to any platform, but Palm and working with them on a daily basis and arguing their cases inside the company helped me crystalize that belief -- the indie developer is the lifeblood of an active and innovative development ecosystem, and deserves to be encouraged and nurtured. It may not be an investment that pays off today, but those developers will go on to lead and push forward those bigger teams, and do so as external evangelists for your products and platforms.\u00a0  As part of my work at Palm, I was part of the team that launched that App store, and actually ran the store during beta before we hired the real App Store team, which, of course, included people we hired from Apple.\u00a0   Apple doesn&#39;t value its developers  So when I talk about App Stores and developer programs and how developers should be treated, I point all this out to show that it&#39;s not exactly theoretical for me, it&#39;s personal. I&#39;ve lived that life, fought those wars (and at Palm, more or less lost at every opportunity, but that&#39;s a sad story for another time). And to a degree, it&#39;s why I&#39;ve always hesitated talking about Apple and their developer programs and App Store.\u00a0  Because to me, Apple does an absolute crap job of taking care of their developers. The defining word that comes to mind to me is -- arrogance. An expectation that the developers need Apple, so Apple doesn&#39;t have to reciprocate.\u00a0  And... With the IOS App store, Apple is absolutely correct. Developers need to be on IOS. It&#39;s far less true on MacOS, and if you&#39;ve ever taken a look at the Apple TV App Store, you can easily see how ludicrously poorly that platform is considered by developers.\u00a0  Apple has never been that interested or great at relationships with developers, and I say that with great respect for many members of Apple&#39;s DTS/Devrel teams, some of whom are friends and who have spent years fighting the good fight internally as well.  It&#39;s gotten worse over the years, and while I will cut Apple some slack -- I don&#39;t think people remotely understand the complexity and difficulty of doing things at the scale Apple has to do them -- but where Apple has over the years had opportunities to improve things for developers and make these platforms more appealing, they have consistently chosen to not take those opportunities. There&#39;s zero reason the App Store cut is still 30%, other than Apple believing it can get away with it.\u00a0  I won&#39;t complain about Apple cutting deals with big companies others can&#39;t get -- I&#39;m thinking Amazon&#39;s 15% cut, for one -- because, well, that&#39;s how business operates and honestly, should. But Apple could have shown some love to the smaller devs as well, and didn&#39;t.  Apple has always had a bad track record with indie/smaller developers -- the term &#34;Sherlocked&#34; comes to mind, and that was purely a case of Apple stepping on t\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 06:01:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u5f00\u53d1,\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b,arrogance,warning", "title": "Apple\uff0c\u5176\u50b2\u6162\u548c\u6743\u5229\u611f\u77e5\u8ba9\u5b83\u5c06\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ebb\u70e6\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u76df\u53cb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e89\u53d6\u4e86\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1 ", "title_en": "Apple, whose arrogance and sense of entitlement let it treat developers as a hassle for two decades, will find few allies as it fights looming regulation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mailchi.mp/eb9158dad79e/v3n6-my-life-in-the-apple-ecosystem", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b", "arrogance", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f388e6a282cdc96cfe83dec81b9e973c.jpg", "infoid": 1066946, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4IOS\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u7981\u7528iPhone\u8fde\u63a5\u5230Wi-Fi\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n \u5728Twitter\u4e0a\uff0cCarl Schou\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u540d\u79f0\u52a0\u5165Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\uff08\u201c\uff05P\uff05S\uff05S\uff05S\uff05N\u201d\uff09\uff0ciPhone\u4e0a\u7684\u6240\u6709Wi-Fi\u529f\u80fd\u90fd\u88ab\u7981\u7528\u4e86\u8be5\u70b9\u3002\n  \u4e00\u65e6iPhone\u6216iPad\u4e0e\u540d\u79f0\u201c\uff05p\uff05s\uff05s\uff05s\uff05n\u201d\u52a0\u5165\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fde\u63a5\u5230Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u4f7f\u7528AirDrop\u7b49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f51\u7edc\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u540e\uff0c\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3002\n \u867d\u7136Schuo\u6ca1\u8be6\u7ec6\u8be6\u8ff0\u4ed6\u5982\u4f55\u5f04\u660e\u767d\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u4f55\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u90fd\u5e94\u8be5\u6ce8\u610f\u89e6\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u9ae6\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n \u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u201c\uff05[\u5b57\u7b26]'\u8bed\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002\u5728C\u4e2d\uff0c\u201c\uff05n\u201d\u8bf4\u660e\u7b26\u662f\u6307\u5c06\u5199\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5199\u5165\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u683c\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002 Wi-Fi\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u4e0d\u9648\u8ff0\u7684Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u540d\u79f0\uff08SSID\uff09\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9\u6267\u884c\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u5e93\uff0c\u8fd9\u53c8\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u610f\u5185\u5b58\u5199\u5165\u548c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u635f\u574f\uff0ciOS\u770b\u95e8\u72d7\u5c06\u6740\u6b7b\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7981\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7684Wi-Fi\u3002\n \u663e\u7136\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6666\u6da9\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u7591\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5373\u4efb\u4f55\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5916\u5730\u843d\u5165\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u6709\u4e00\u5806Wi-Fi Pranksters\u7a81\u7136\u7528\u6bd2\u51fa\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u7a81\u7136\u6253\u5f00Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u7a81\u7136\u5f39\u51fa\u3002\u76f4\u5230Apple\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u6b64\u8fb9\u7f18\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55Wi-Fi\u7f51\u7edc\u7559\u51fa\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u574f\u786c\u4ef6\u3002 \n\u60a8\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u91cd\u7f6e\u6240\u6709\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 \u5728\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f6c\u5230\u4e00\u822c - \uff06gt;

The issue persists after rebooting the device (although a workaround does exist, see below).\n Although Schuo does not detail exactly how he figured this out, any programmer should notice a pattern in the funky network name required to trigger the bug.\n Here\u2019s the likely explanation: the \u2018%[character]\u2019 syntax is commonly used in programming languages to format variables into an output string. In C, the \u2018%n\u2019 specifier means to save the number of characters written into the format string out to a variable passed to the string format function. The Wi-Fi subsystem probably passes the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) unsanitized to some internal library that is performing string formatting, which in turn causes an arbitrary memory write and buffer overflow. This will lead to memory corruption and the iOS watchdog will kill the process, hence effectively disabling Wi-Fi for the user.\n Obviously, this is such an obscure chain of events that it is highly unlikely that any person accidentally falls into this, unless a load of Wi-Fi pranksters suddenly pop up in the wild with open Wi-Fi networks using the poisoned name. Until Apple fixes this edge case in a future OS update, just keep an eye out for any Wi-Fi networks with percent symbols in their name.\n Nevertheless, If you  are somehow affected by this, the bug does not appear to permanently damage your hardware.\n You should be able to reset all network settings and start over. In Settings, go to General -&gt; Reset -&gt; Reset Network Settings. This resets all saved Wi-Fi networks on the iPhone (as well as other things like cellular settings and VPN access), thereby removing the knowledge of the malicious network name from its memory. You can then join your standard home Wi-Fi once more.\n After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID \u201c%p%s%s%s%s%n\u201d, my iPhone permanently disabled it\u2019s WiFi functionality.
