fzf. fzf is a command-line tool for fuzzy searching. Well, at first, it might sound that not attractive.

Or, if you are on macOS and want to skip all the fuss, you can use the following command:\n    After installing, let\u2019s go and try the basic fzf functionality. You can try to run  fzf inside your terminal. You should see something like this:\n  The fuzzy finder launches across your terminal window, and you can search for whatever file you want. The cool thing is that fzf if indexing files as you type. If your directory doesn\u2019t have much complexity regarding files and dirs, you won\u2019t notice the indexing at the bottom.\n  The first trick today is using fzf to quickly  cd into a directory. You can press  ALT + c ( OPTION + c on macOS), and you will get an interactive prompt. Take a look below:\n  It starts indexing the contents of all the directories that are inside the one you are in right now. You can start typing for the wanted directory, select the one you need with arrow keys, and press the enter key to get into it. Convenient, right?\n  The second trick and one of my favorites, to be honest, is the ability to search through the command history with fzf. To get started, press  CTRL + r in your terminal. Then, search for a command you typed previously. You should see something like this:\n  You can quickly jump to the command you typed some time ago. I find it super useful on a day-to-day basis.\n  You can utilize fzf almost anywhere in your terminal. One of the default features is to allow you to find the process to kill quickly. You can try it out by typing  kill -9 and pressing  TAB. If that doesn\u2019t work, type  kill -9 ** and  TAB. You can now search for the process or multiple processes you want to end.\n You can also quickly search through hostnames to SSH. To do this, type  ssh ** and press  TAB. You will get the interactive search to find the wanted hostname.\n   If you get tired of typing  **, you can change the fzf trigger by setting  FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER variable. For example:\n  If you want to take this to the next step, try out the  fzf-tab plugin. I am using zsh and oh-my-zsh, so it was pretty straightforward to set up. The plugin basically \u201cplugs in\u201d fzf into your default tab completion. I suggest you try it out.\n  Another cool thing to try out is the preview feature of the fzf. It allows you to preview files before you open them. To access it, you need to pass  --preview- to fzf. Let\u2019s see it in action:\n    But you can customize this all you want. My command uses the  bat, the  cat clone you can find on  GitHub. You can also go with the simple  cat command like so:\n  Or, if you want to push this a bit more, you can set the default preview options when completing specific commands. You can show the tree view of the directories and files like so:\n  You can achieve the similar using the power of the  tree. I had to install it on macOS with  brew install tree. Then, I added the  _fzf_comprun function to load on shell initialization (you can add it in  .bashrc or  .zshrc). Here is how it looks:\n ( )  {    command = $1    case  &#34; $command&#34;  in   ) fzf  &#34;  [email\u00a0protected]&#34; --preview  &#39;tree -C {} | head -200&#39;  ; ; * ) fzf  &#34;  [email\u00a0protected]&#34;  ; ;  esac }\n You can add more cases with more commands if you\u2019d like because you might want the different commands to show the preview in other cases. For example,  cat and  bat will work well for files but not for previewing directories and hostnames to SSH into.\n  If you\u2019re already using Vim (or you\u2019re planning), I must tell you that fzf fits with Vim perfectly. The fuzzy search, preview windows, and customization options are so lovely you\u2019d going to wish to have it in every other situation.\n If you\u2019re interested in setting up Vim and fzf, check out my blog post about  improving Vim workflow with fzf.\n  fzf is a great tool to have in your toolbelt, especially if you\u2019re dwelling inside the terminal.

", "note_en": "From tech in NYC to chemical manufacturing in Nasik (India), here&#39;s a guide that hopefully nobody ever needs.\n      It was also the day I started to lead a second company \u2013 his company. (Note: the first company is CB Insights.)\n His company was in India (a country I knew little about) in the chemical manufacturing industry (an industry I knew nothing about).\n  While I don\u2019t think most people would ever find themselves in a similar situation (I certainly hope not), I thought I\u2019d share the story and some of my learnings &amp; observations from that time about business, M&amp;A, teams, India, and assorted miscellaneous thoughts.\n  Notes: \u00a0This will probably be slightly rambly and stream-of-consciousness as there are lots of thoughts rolling around in my head.\n      As I was going with family to cremate my father in a traditional Hindu funeral, someone who I didn\u2019t know came up to me and said in Hindi, \u201c  Saab, humara kya hoga? \u201d\n     And I remember thinking to myself, \u201cWhy the F are you asking me about this right now?\u201d\n But this wasn\u2019t the time for anger or to even to think about this so I just knee-jerk responded in my heavily American-accented Hindi that \u201c  Meh dekh loonga \u201d which translates to \u201cI\u2019ll look after it.\u201d\n And so at that point, in addition to CB Insights, I knew I was going to run my Dad\u2019s business. To be honest, I had already thought about this possibility when he was admitted to the hospital when the doctors said the situation was looking dire.\n But no matter my age, Dad was always the strongest, smartest person I knew, and so I assumed he\u2019d pull through and things would go back to normal. With him tirelessly working on Atlas, the company he founded, and me going back to CB Insights.\n     Before we go further, a bit of context on Atlas, my Dad\u2019s business.\n  The company was recently renamed AIMS Impex, but it started and for most of its life, it was known as Atlas Fine Chemicals. Industry folks know it as Atlas, and my sisters and I grew up knowing it under that name so I will refer to it as Atlas going forward.\n Atlas is a manufacturer of specialty flavor &amp; fragrance chemicals such as coumarin, 6-methyl coumarin, safranal, natural vanilla, and cyclocitral among others. Atlas\u2019 customers include the world\u2019s largest flavor &amp; fragrance houses including IFF, Givaudan, Firmenich, Takasago, and Symrise among others.\n Atlas is based 4 hours from Mumbai in a city called Nasik (1.486 million people) and the manufacturing facility is about 35 minutes from Nasik in a small village called Sinnar.\n        I don\u2019t remember the exact day I went to the office for the first time as the weeks after April 17th were a blur of family, tradition, and emotion.\n Before even stepping foot in the office, I had asked the team to send me the reports they sent to Dad so I could get familiar with the business.\n TBH, I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d do with these reports, but I figured that acting like I knew what I might be doing might provide some confidence to the team.\n Candidly, my only qualification to run Atlas at this time was that I was the founder\u2019s son.\n I had tried to be the good Indian son back in 1998-2000 and work at Atlas so knew the biz a bit in its earlier days, but 18 years is a long time for a business and my mind was jammed with all sorts of other experiences and ideas since then. My time at Atlas was just a distant memory.\n In 1998, moving from the fun of NYC to small town India was tough especially as someone born and brought up in the US. Moreover, I was a know-it-all who had all the answers despite just graduating from college and so my dad\u2019s inability to recognize my genius bothered me.\n   I still wonder what Atlas might have become if I could have figured out how to be more of a student and less of an Ivy League douche when I was working with my dad back then. What kind of duo might we have been?\n So, in a strange and sad way, this was an opportunity to finally be the good Indian son and run Dad\u2019s business.\n    I was referred to as Sir, which is what everyone referred to my father as.\n  I remember thinking this was odd at the time, and during all my visits to the office subsequently, but in many ways, this sort of cultural deference to the unqualified boss\u2019 son is what enabled Atlas to carry on.\n I imagine if the same had happened in the US, there would have been many more questions about my qualifications and capabilities. At Atlas, those conversations might have very well happened, but I doubt it. Or, if they did, these questions weren\u2019t directed to me. I got lucky here.\n Everyone, for better or worse, assumed I had a clue and was looking for me to develop a plan.\n      How does one develop a plan when you don\u2019t understand the business, the science, the industry, the country, and sometimes even the language? (I have passable Hindi but a lot of the local conversations at Atlas were in Marathi which I don\u2019t understand.)\n   I entertained Option 1 for about 6 weeks. The ill-conceived idea was that I\u2019d figure out how to run both Atlas and CB Insights, going forward with Atlas\u00a0as the beachhead for a larger industrials business and CB Insights\u00a0as the first part of a massive technology arm.\n   In India, you see all these families (Ambani, Birla, Tata, Godrej, Hinduja, etc) who are in every potential business line possible. I figured they all started somewhere. Maybe this would be my starting point.\n After about 6 weeks of trying to be present at CB Insights, but doing calls every morning at 6am with the Atlas team and emails every evening responding to the team or to Atlas customers, it became apparent that Option 1 wasn\u2019t feasible.\n I kept this 6am morning call/evening email routine going for the last 13 months with CB Insights occupying the middle of the day and every other minute of idle brain time. Needless to say, I\u2019ve aged immeasurably in the last 13 months. My desire to build a multi-industry conglomerate died because the idea was just too tiring.\n  For a second, I looked at what the company might fetch for its assets. Its land, plant, etc.\n I\u2019d never done something like this but I remember hearing about it when Gordon Gecko talked about it in the movie   Wall Street  so figured, why not?\n   But this wasn\u2019t a real option ever and was discounted in a few hours.\n My dad built this company over 30 years with many of his team having been with him for 20+. Selling the company\u2019s assets, even if feasible, would be me failing his team and him.\n   The third idea was to see if there was someone who could run Atlas with some guidance from Dad\u2019s team and me (assuming I could eventually understand the business). And then give this person the ability to earn more and more equity over time.\n  This idea was appealing as it\u2019d let my family continue to be involved with the business while also finding someone capable to take it to the next level.\n The problem here was that I had no network in India from which to even think about finding someone for this role. I spoke with a couple of candidates via introductions but nothing really stuck for them or me. Moving to Nasik was a challenge even for those in India, but that was just a symptom of not finding the right person.\n This would have been an amazing opportunity for the right person, but it wasn\u2019t in the cards.\n   The challenge, however, was that Dad\u2019s business didn\u2019t have too many natural buyers and was considered a small market transaction making it even tougher.\n And so I didn\u2019t have any control on the M&amp;A side of things.\n I focused on running the business and hoped a suitable acquirer would show up. If nobody showed up, I\u2019d keep running it.\n I gave myself 3 years to run both Atlas and CB Insights, thinking I could maintain the daily schedule of 6am calls and evening emails with India interspersed, with trips every 6-8 weeks before burning out. 3 years was a completely arbitrary timeline.\n About 6 months in, I realized doing both for that long really wasn\u2019t sustainable for a number of reasons \u2014 health, family, and it wasn\u2019t optimal for either CB Insights or Atlas.\n But I didn\u2019t know the buyer market and couldn\u2019t control it so I focused on what I could control.\n    Despite Atlas being very different than CB Insights, the answer about how to run it came to me easier than a lot of the other questions I had over the last 13 months.\n       I looked at the financials for Atlas vs peers in the industry and talked to some of my dad\u2019s trusted advisors, and it was apparent that Atlas\u2019 margins were best-in-industry.\n  Atlas was efficient, and my dad obsessed about margins, foregoing business that was low margin to keep overall profit margins high.\n It was clear that focusing on the margin side wasn\u2019t the best place for my time or energy.\n Plus, most of the efficiency to be gained was in the manufacturing process and that is where I was zero value-add. Dad was also the ultimate technical co-founder. I was as non-technical as they come in a chemical manufacturing setting.\n   And I needed to paint a picture that the team could see. Improving margin by XX basis points wasn\u2019t going to be what got anyone fired up.\n So I decided to focus on growth. Growth not via new products as that would also require Dad, the technical co-founder.\n  This was also the only way to run the company that I had a chance of being useful in.\n And it was also the way I could show the Atlas team we were doing well. And that I might have some value beyond being the boss\u2019 son.\n Selling is something everyone sees, especially in a manufacturing setting. From the workers at the factory to the plant staff, if they see trucks coming in for product dispatches, they know the product they\u2019re making is selling. If the staff in the office is busy generating invoices and fielding customer calls, they see the product is selling.\n And while I\u2019m by no means a natural at selling, if armed with the right product, I can sell. And Atlas\u2019 Coumarin was the best in the world.\n In the chemical industry, it\u2019s unheard of to be a single product company for 30 years. But Atlas was able to do that because the product is hard to make, and they are the best at it.\n  Note: It is worth noting that in a competitive chemical product, margins cannot be ignored. So while growth was the focus, I did focus on major expenses \u2014 raw materials, shipping, packaging. But this was only 5% of my time as the very capable team at Atlas managed these expertly.\n  So with growth being the focus, I went about assembling a list of people and firms in the industry I should reach out to.\n I went through my dad\u2019s emails to see who he\u2019d interacted with and reached out to all of them.\n I visited various fragrance and flavor association and conference websites and took down their member and attendee names and reached out to them.\n It wasn\u2019t a particularly structured process, but I wanted those that knew my dad to know that Atlas was still humming and they could rely on us for product.\n And for those that didn\u2019t know us, the next time they had a need, they knew they could reach out to us.\n This was a lot of cold emailing and cold calling. I have heightened respect for what SDRs do at CB Insights or anywhere. It is hard work. But also incredibly rewarding when someone closes based on your efforts.\n At the same time, I also focused on price. Dad had built a high margin business which afforded me the opportunity to try to gain market share by being more aggressive with price.\n Coumarin is probably a 6,000 ton product per year. Atlas was about 10-12% of the global market, but we had capacity at the plant that wasn\u2019t being used so I knew we could produce and sell more. There is some supply-demand curve, marginal cost calculation I could have done here, but I didn\u2019t do any of that.\n I did some back of the envelope math in my head and had worked out a simple, rudimentary cost per kg formula in Excel to ensure we were always making something on a sale, but I ran Atlas on instinct a lot more than analysis.\n Atlas has a great team with lots of experience. I assumed if I was doing something really really dumb, they\u2019d tell me \ud83d\ude42\n In the last financial year (April 2017-March 2018), Atlas had its best revenue in history. In November 2017, we dispatched 100 tons of Coumarin to customers for the first time in the company\u2019s history.\n I remember taking   mithai  (sweets) to the site at the end of November when the 100 ton month happened and celebrating with the team. It was one of the proudest days I\u2019ve ever had professionally. I was incredibly proud of the Atlas team who had seen a potentially company-sinking event happen with my dad\u2019s death in April and who\u2019d kept fighting and doing good work and then just had a historic month.\n    As soon as I took over the business, the calls started coming from interested buyers or their investment banks.\n Dad had already been in discussions with 1 firm prior to his death, and I\u2019d met them once with him. They re-engaged.\n The flavor &amp; fragrance industry in India is big, but small at the same time.\n  As a result, various buyers expressed interest. I reached out to a couple of our large customers to feel them out.\n  I had done some basic research on the space so I understood the players and sounded at least reasonably smart. A report by investment bank Avendus on the flavor &amp; fragrance industry was useful for a novice like me. Atlas was a base ingredient manufacturer. Our likely buyers were either larger base ingredient manufacturers or functional ingredient manufacturers who were interested in vertical integration.\n  There were 5 buyers that either came to us or that I\u2019d identified and gotten some expression of interest from.\n Buyer 1 \u2013 A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes\n  Buyer 3 \u2013 A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US\n   Before digging into how things went with each buyer, it is worth understanding that there were certain criteria I had for a deal which made eliminating certain buyers easy.\n  They had to take care of the team  \u2014 I wanted to find a growth-oriented company as ensuring the team that had helped build Atlas would be taken care of was critical. \u00a0The biggest factor in any decision was this as I viewed it as intertwined with my dad\u2019s legacy. He spent 30 years building this company with this team. It was important that this be maintained and hopefully taken to the next level. There is, of course, no way to know this for sure and this is where one\u2019s gut and how the buyer across the table makes you feel is important.\n Simple deal  \u2014 I was not interested in stock in a private company or an illiquid public company or a long earn-out or some other complex structure. Atlas wouldn\u2019t be a big deal for any credible buyer. Complexity wasn\u2019t required. I also didn\u2019t have time to educate a buyer on the space.\n A fair price  \u2014 When the founder/face of a company dies (my dad), a bunch of bottom feeding parasites can show up. I wasn\u2019t expecting to get a top of the market price for Atlas, but I wanted a fair one. Moreover, the longer I ran Atlas, the more confident I became in my ability to run it. So the price was only going to go up with time.\n  Buyer 1 \u2014 A publicly traded Indian firm that also makes Coumarin at much smaller volumes\n I met with one of the execs of this firm along with their investment bank once.\n I shared high-level data on Atlas with them but the conversation ended after that. They were saddled with lots of debt as I could see given they were public and so didn\u2019t think a deal with them would meet the criteria I had on fair price, simplicity, or even ability to take care of the team.\n     They were interested in Atlas. We talked a bit and they proposed a deal, but the structure was complicated and so I let this one go. They are a long-standing client and we were far enough away from any deal that it didn\u2019t make sense to engage further.\n Buyer 3 \u2014 A wealthy family looking to buy a business for their son returning from the US\n  They were a family with a large industrial business and were interested in expanding into new lines as their son was returning to India from the US. (I guess really wealthy people do things like this).\n  The challenge here was that it\u2019d require lots of education about the industry and the probability of success even after investing would be low.\n    This was the firm my dad was already in discussions with. The firm had seen Atlas\u2019 numbers and had actually given an offer to my dad prior to his death. They seemed the most promising at the outset given the diligence they\u2019d already done.\n   For an hour, they told me all the reasons Atlas wasn\u2019t a great business. I listened as I\u2019m probably too deferential to those older than me than I should be.\n And after listening for a while, I asked them, \u201cYou\u2019ve told me all the reasons Atlas is such a bad company. So why do you want to acquire it?\u201d\n   Part of this may have been culture fit and part of this was likely ownership by PE which complicated decision-making on their side. It\u2019s important to understand the decision-making criteria and process of a buyer when discussing M&amp;A.\n  I told them that process didn\u2019t work for Atlas or me or my family. And I told them that process was what we needed to run. When they said no, I wished them luck and moved on.\n I was nervous doing this tbh. There wasn\u2019t a huge list of buyers for Atlas and shutting one of them out seemed at times like it might be foolish. But you have to go with your gut on these things.\n    I\u2019d received lots of calls from bankers prior and I insisted they tell me who they were representing as many were just fishing.\n    I explained my criteria, they explained their vision, they put a non-binding offer together that was clean/clear and we got moving on diligence.\n   On May 31st, I flew back to India. \u00a0It was my 8th trip in the last 13 months.\n I landed at 10pm. The offices of Avendus, the investment bank representing Eternis, the buyer, was the first destination.\n I arrived at 11pm and we worked until 5am to hash out final details of the deal.\n We went away for 4.5 hours to shower and get some sleep and resumed at Eternis\u2019 office at 930am on June 1st. By 4pm that day, the deal was done.\n  The news broke within the industry pretty quickly. During the 4-hour drive to Nasik, folks started calling and WhatsApp messaging me \u2014 customers, vendors, etc.\n   I was hoping to tell the team on Saturday (6 day workweek at Atlas) in the office so I felt bad that some of them heard about the deal on Friday evening through others.\n The next day, I went to the factory and members of the Eternis team came. Manu of the Eternis team addressed the office and factory staff and gave a great view into their goals and their company.\n   On June 4th, we decided that our family would officially say farewell to the entire Atlas team at the factory. We had everyone from the office come up.\n My mom, kids, and wife flew in from the States. I wanted my kids to see what their \u201cDada\u201d (grandfather) had built at least 1 time before it moved onto the next chapter in its story.\n   I had prepared a speech in English and my wife translated it to Hindi. My Hindi is not very good so beyond the emotion of this farewell, I was pretty scared of delivering a several minute speech in Hindi. I\u2019d never done something like that.\n We assembled in the warehouse, and I stood on top of the chemical mixer and talked to the team. I fought back tears several times during my speech. My Hindi was intelligible enough that I had several others on the Atlas team also crying so I guess that my message was understood.\n  My speech in English is below. \u00a0It was delivered in Hindi, and the video is something I hope to show my kids when they are old enough to understand.\n  My Hindi is not very good so please forgive me if I make any mistakes.\n Dad started Atlas 29 years ago. As my sisters and I were growing up, we joked that Atlas was his 4th child.\n But in reality, Atlas was less of a 4th child \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-22 19:12:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u56fd\u5bb6,sell", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u60a8\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u9500\u552e\u516c\u53f8 ", "title_en": "How to Manage and Sell a Company in an Industry and a Country You Don\u2019t Know", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cbinsights.com/research/team-blog/run-sell-company/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fd\u5bb6", "sell"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5eed17fcff4511246cecb99cf020f36c.gif", "infoid": 1067409, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53bb\u5e74\u7684\u660e\u661f\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u666f\u89c2 -

Astrophysicists reached this conclusion, published on 16 June in  Nature  1, using high-resolution imaging of Betelgeuse before and after the dimming, combined with computer simulations.\n Normally, Betelgeuse is one of the ten brightest stars in the night sky. For decades, researchers have known that it undergoes cycles of dimming roughly every 425 days, during which it temporarily loses about one-quarter of its peak brightness. But in February 2020, astronomers noticed that the star\u2019s brightness had dropped by an unprecedented two-thirds \u2014 enough to be noticeable with the naked eye.\n  The unexplained dimming fuelled speculation that the star could be about to explode. Betelgeuse is a red supergiant \u2014 a type of star that\u2019s more massive and thousands of times shorter-lived than the Sun \u2014 and it is expected to end its life in a spectacular supernova explosion sometime in the next 100,000 years. This event would provide a spectacle the likes of which Earthlings have not seen in centuries: the last supernova in the Milky Way that could be observed from Earth was in 1604, and Betelgeuse is so close to our planet that its supernova will be bright enough to be visible during daytime for weeks. The star is around 168 parsecs (548 light years) away, according to the most current estimates  2.\n But many astrophysicists warned that the supernova speculation was wishful thinking. They pointed out that the dimming was likely to be caused by more mundane mechanisms, such as a blob of unusually cold matter appearing on the surface of the star in what\u2019s known as a convective cell, or a cloud of dust crossing the line of sight to it.\n Now, astrophysicist Miguel Montarg\u00e8s at the Paris Observatory and his collaborators have found that the reason for the \u2018great dimming\u2019 was probably a combination of both of those factors.\n  The team took a series of high-resolution images of the star in January 2019, December 2019, January 2020 and March 2020, using the Very Large Telescope in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. Betelgeuse is more than 16 times the mass of the Sun, and 764 times its width \u2014 so big that if it were located at the centre of the Solar System, it would engulf the orbits of all the planets up to Mars. This makes it one of the few stars that astronomers can resolve as a disk, rather than as a single dot of light, explains Montarg\u00e8s, who has been studying Betelgeuse on and off for a decade and has been interested in it since he was ten years old, when it was the first star that he was able to identify in the sky.\n  The images clearly showed that the bottom left-hand part of the star \u2014 as seen from Earth&#39;s Northern Hemisphere \u2014 had dimmed dramatically, and that the position of the darker region did not change substantially over the imaging period. This indicated that the dim spot was caused by a cloud of dust that had been spewed by the star itself, and was moving roughly in the direction of the line of sight, rather than passing by. \u201cIf it had been one cloud transiting, it should have crossed the star,\u201d Montarg\u00e8s says.\n The team\u2019s explanation for the dimming is that an unusually cool convective cell led to a drastic drop in temperature in the star\u2019s atmosphere.

"note_en": "The funding round, said to be the largest Series A investment in cybersecurity history and one of the highest valuations for a bootstrapped company, was led by  Insight Partners and General Atlantic, with additional investment from Cyberstarts, Geodesic, SYN Ventures, Vintage, and Artisanal Ventures.\n Transmit Security said it has a pre-money valuation of $2.2 billion, and will use the new funds to expand its reach and investing in key global areas to grow the organization.\n Ultimately, however, the funding round will help the company to accelerate its mission to help the world go passwordless. Organizations lose millions of dollars every year due to \u201cinherently unsafe\u201d password-based authentication, according to the startup; not only do weak passwords account for more than 80% of all  data breaches, but the average help desk labor cost to reset a single password stands at more than $70.\n Transmit says its biometric-based authenticator is the first natively passwordless identity and risk management solution, and it has already been adopted by a number of big-name brands including Lowes, Santander, and UBS. The solution, which currently handles more than 9,000 authentication requests per second, can reduce account resets by 96%, the company says, and reduces customer authentication from 1 minute to 2 seconds.\n \u201cBy eliminating passwords, businesses can immediately reduce churn and cart abandonment and provide superior security for personal data,\u201d said Transmit Security CEO Mickey Boodaei, who co-founded the company in 2014. \u201cOur customers, whether they are in the retail, banking, financial, telecommunications, or automotive sectors, understand that providing an optimized identity experience is a multimillion-dollar challenge. With this latest round of funding from premier partners, we can significantly expand our reach to help rid the world of passwords.\u201d\n Transmit Security isn\u2019t the only company that\u2019s on a mission to kill off the password. Microsoft has announced plans to make  Windows 10 password-free, and  Apple recently previewed Passkeys in iCloud Keychain, a method of passwordless authentication powered by  WebAuthn, and Face ID and Touch ID.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 18:30:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bc6\u7801,\u5b89\u5168\u6027,security", "title": "\u4f20\u8f93\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86543\u7c73\u7cfb\u5217A\u624d\u80fd\u7ec8\u6b62\u5bc6\u7801 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTransmit Security raises $543M Series A to kill off the password\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bc6\u7801", "\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "security"]}]
