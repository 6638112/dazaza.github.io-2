It was a combination of four chips, and it could be programmed to do other things too, like run a cash register or a  pinball game. Flexible and inexpensive, the 4004 propelled an entire industry forward; it was the conceptual forefather of the machine upon which you are probably reading this very article.</p><p>您可能听说过的第一个微处理器的故事是这样的：英特尔4004于1971年末推出，用于计算器。它是四个芯片的组合，还可以编程来做其他事情，例如运行收银机或弹球游戏。 4004灵活且价格便宜，推动了整个行业的发展。这是您可能正在阅读本文的机器的概念先驱。</p><p> That’s the canonical sketch. But objects, events, people—they have alternate histories. Their stories can often be told a different way, from a different perspective, or a  what could have been.</p><p> 这就是规范的草图。但是对象，事件，人-他们有着不同的历史。他们的故事通常可以从不同的角度，以不同的方式讲述，或者可以说是这样。</p><p> This is the story, then, of how  another first microprocessor, a secret one, came to be—and of my own entwinement with it. The device was designed by a team at a company called Garrett AiResearch on a subcontract for Grumman, the aircraft manufacturer. It was larger, it was a combination of six chips, and it performed crucial functions for the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of its first flight this week. It was called the Central Air Data Computer, and it computed things like altitude and Mach number; it figured out the angle of attack, key to landing and missile targeting; and it controlled the wing sweep, allowing the craft to be both maneuverable when the wings were at about 50 degrees and very, very fast when they were swept all the way back.</p><p> 这就是关于另一个第一个微处理器（一个秘密的微处理器）如何诞生的故事，以及我自己与之交织在一起的故事。该设备是由一家名为Garrett AiResearch的公司的团队设计的，该飞机是为飞机制造商Grumman分包的。它更大，由六个芯片组成，并且为F-14雄猫战斗机执行了关键功能，该机庆祝本周首飞50周年。它被称为中央航空数据计算机，它可以计算高度和马赫数。它确定了攻击角度，着陆和导弹瞄准的关键；它控制了机翼后掠，使飞机既可以在机翼处于约50度角时进行机动，又可以在机翼向后扫过时非常快速地操作。</p><p>  Ray Holt was one of the engineers for the Central Air Data Computer. He is probably not someone you have heard of—how could you have? He worked on the project, one of two people doing what’s called the logic design, for two years, between 1968 and 1970, with a team that included his younger brother, Bill. He couldn’t tell anyone about what they had built. The project was kept quiet by the Navy and by Garrett for decades as other engineers were awarded credit for inventing firsts. Later, when he was able to talk about the device, people were skeptical. Maybe they were uncomfortable with history being revised.</p><p>  雷·霍尔特（Ray Holt）是中央航空数据计算机的工程师之一。他可能不是您所听说的人，您怎么能拥有？在1968年至1970年之间，他从事了这个项目，这是从事逻辑设计的两个人之一，他的团队包括他的弟弟比尔（Bill），工作了两年。他无法告诉任何人他们的建造物。几十年来，该项目一直被海军和加勒特（Garrett）所静默，因为其他工程师因发明了第一件发明而获得荣誉。后来，当他能够谈论该设备时，人们对此表示怀疑。也许他们对修改历史感到不舒服。</p><p> I wanted to know more about him. Ray has always been in the margins of my life, ghosting around the edges of my consciousness. I remember visiting his parents’ house in Compton, California, when I was very young. His family came to our place once, and I have a memory of chasing one of his three sons up the stairs. One time, when I was in my mid-twenties, I unknowingly sat next to him in the audience at a  health food talk my mother was giving. She was surprised to see us sitting together when she came out afterward to say hello.</p><p> 我想进一步了解他。雷一直在我生命的边缘，在我意识的边缘徘徊。我记得我很小的时候去过他父母在加利福尼亚州康普顿的房子。他的家人曾经来过我们的住所，我对追逐他的三个儿子中的一个有记忆。有一次，我二十多岁的时候，不知不觉中我妈妈在讲保健食品，在听众旁边坐在他旁边。后来我们出来打个招呼时，她很惊讶地看到我们坐在一起。</p><p>  Ray Holt is 76 years old now. He lives in rural Mississippi, where he teaches high school STEM classes and runs  a robotics nonprofit. Me, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, with my husband, a software engineer, and two sons; I’ve been an editor at WIRED for more than a decade. Ray and I reconnected over the summer, and after he told me his story, I wanted to learn more about the Central Air Data Computer and its place in history—and how his life might have branched around mine.</p><p>  雷·霍尔特（Ray Holt）今年76岁。他住在密西西比州的乡村地区，在那里他教高中STEM课，并经营一个机器人公益组织。我，我和丈夫，一位软件工程师和两个儿子住在旧金山湾区。我已经在WIRED担任编辑十多年。我和Ray在整个夏天重新建立了联系，在他告诉我他的故事之后，我想了解更多有关Central Air Data Computer及其历史地位的信息，以及他的生活可能如何在我的身边发展。</p><p>  His career as an engineer almost didn’t happen. Growing up in Compton, Ray made extra cash fixing bicycles and old tube radios; in high school he was class president and a great baseball player, but he was also a B student who had difficulty reading. His teachers sometimes discounted him. One once said to him, “I wish you were as good a student as Bill.” Everybody loved Bill. Math genius, they said. When Ray took an aptitude test during his senior year, he was told that he had low mechanical ability. He was told, “Don’t go into engineering.”</p><p>  他的工程师生涯几乎没有发生。雷在康普顿长大，赚了很多钱，用来修理自行车和旧的收音机。在高中时，他曾是班长和出色的棒球运动员，但他还是一名B学生，阅读困难。他的老师有时会贬低他。曾经有人对他说：“我希望你像比尔一样好。”每个人都爱比尔。他们说，数学天才。当雷在他高三的时候进行能力测试时，他被告知他的机械能力很低。他被告知：“不要进入工程领域。” </p><p>  He made his way to the University of Idaho; Bill was off to Stanford on a baseball scholarship. Ray was struggling until he took a course called Physics of Electricity. He aced it. He got an A in calculus, made the dean’s list, and ultimately graduated with a degree in electronic engineering from Cal Poly Pomona, getting job offers from Bendix, Westinghouse, and Garrett AiResearch. Turns out, Bill was interviewing at Garrett too, for a job as a computer programmer. They both decided to work for Garrett, but maybe for Bill the decision was a little more layered: At the time, he was dating a young woman he had met at Stanford named Sally Wetzel, who happened to be the daughter of the president of Garrett AiResearch. Later, she would be Sally Fallon—my mother.</p><p>他去了爱达荷大学。比尔以棒球奖学金去了斯坦福大学。雷一直在苦苦挣扎，直到他参加了一个名为“电力物理”的课程。他a了一下。他获得微积分A学位，并入围院长名单，并最终获得了Cal Poly Pomona的电子工程学位，并从Bendix，Westinghouse和Garrett AiResearch获得了工作机会。原来，比尔也在加勒特（Garrett）面试，从事计算机程序员的工作。他们俩都决定为加勒特工作，但也许对比尔而言，这个决定更加复杂：当时，他正在约会一个在斯坦福认识的年轻女子，名叫萨莉·韦泽尔（Sally Wetzel），恰好是加勒特总统的女儿。 AiResearch。后来，她将是我的母亲萨莉·法伦。</p><p> The story of my mom and Bill is an alternate history, one lightly sketched in the mind and emotionally charged, a little trickle of current.</p><p> 我妈妈和比尔的故事是另类的历史，一个在脑海中轻描淡写，充满感情的故事，时而流淌。</p><p> Bill met Sally when she went to a party for incoming freshmen. “We were together from the first day I was at college. We were an item,” Sally says. In addition to being smart, extremely athletic, good looking, and kind, “Bill was musical. He played the clarinet and had a beautiful voice. It was so much fun to harmonize with him in church.”</p><p> 比尔去参加聚会的新生时遇到了莎莉。 “从我上大学的第一天起，我们就在一起了。我们是一个项目，”莎莉说。除了比尔聪明，极具运动能力，好看和友善之外，“比尔还是音乐剧。他演奏单簧管，声音优美。在教堂里和他和睦相处真是太有趣了。”</p><p>  When I was young, I’d find Bill’s signature and inscriptions in books I idly plucked from shelves on bored afternoons. He had lovely cursive handwriting. Squirreled away in my possession is a book of e.e. cummings poetry that he gave Sally in 1967. This is the inscription:</p><p>  小时候，我在无聊的下午从书架上随手拿来的书中找到比尔的签名和题词。他的草书很可爱。藏在我身上的是一本e.e.他在1967年送给莎莉的康明斯诗歌。这是题词：</p><p> Whatever distance lies between us (but cannot blind our eyes to the happiness we owe), howmuchever time separates us (but does not calm the fire of two minds and two hearts bound in one soul); we will always be “wonderful one times one” …..</p><p> 无论我们之间有多远（但不能使我们对所欠的幸福视而不见），无论时间如何分隔我们（但无法使两个心灵和束缚在一个灵魂中的两颗心的火焰平静下来）；我们将永远是“美好的一次”。</p><p> A shadow relationship. A reminder, perhaps, that my mother existed before I did, had her own noncanonical life that stretched back beyond the one that had instantiated me.</p><p> 影子关系。也许是在提醒我，母亲比我先存在，她的非规范生活可以追溯到使我实例化的生活之外。</p><p> I had always kind of known about Bill, and I had always been curious about him. He was so  handsome. So smart. Poetic, too. When I got older, I’d sometimes Google around to see what else I could find out about him. I knew he had worked at Garrett, and I once found a list of people who worked on something to do with the F-14. His name was on it. A Ray Holt was on the list too—must be some other Holt, I thought.  Weird, though, right? I said to my husband. Who could that be? I didn’t make the connection with the man who once visited my house, or the one sitting next to me at the conference. I could have asked Sally, of course, but I never did.</p><p> 我一直对比尔有所了解，并且一直对他感到好奇。他好帅。这么聪明。富有诗意。等我长大后，有时我会在Google周围逛逛，看看还能从中找到关于他的更多信息。我知道他曾在加勒特（Garrett）工作，而我曾经找到了一些从事F-14工作的人员名单。他的名字在上面。雷·霍尔特（Ray Holt）也在名单上-我想一定是其他霍尔特。不过很奇怪，对吧？我对我丈夫说。那会是谁？我没有和曾经去过我家的人，或者会议中坐在我旁边的那个人建立联系。我本可以问萨利，但我从未问过。 </p><p> My husband did some Googling of his own, more directed, efficient, unromantic, logical Googling, and found that Ray Holt had a website. That led my husband to a slim autobiography Ray self-published called  The Accidental Engineer. He gave it to Sally, who was flabbergasted. She emailed Ray and we all set up a Zoom call: She had known Bill had worked on some computations related to fighter planes, but she never knew Ray had been involved.</p><p>我的丈夫用自己的，更有针对性的，高效的，浪漫的，合乎逻辑的谷歌搜索功能进行了一次谷歌搜索，结果发现雷·霍尔特（Ray Holt）拥有一个网站。这使我丈夫有了雷·雷·索尔（Ray）自己出版的苗条的自传，名为《偶然工程师》。他把它送给了饱经风霜的萨莉。她给Ray发了电子邮件，我们所有人都发起了Zoom呼叫：她知道Bill从事与战斗机相关的某些计算工作，但她从来不知道Ray参与其中。</p><p>  And what a plane to have been involved with. It is my personal truth that the F-14 is the most radical, hella gnarliest airplane in history. I was 13 when I first saw  Top Gun in the theater; I had the soundtrack on cassette tape. Maybe the opening scene is etched into your neural network too, the ’80s synth chords rising portentously as the Tomcats whine their way into position on the flight deck. Then the afterburners blast to life in the dawn’s early light, and the thing punches into the atmosphere. It is arguably the star of the movie and it doesn’t even chew gum or take its shirt off. As Dave Baranek, a former Naval Flight Officer and Topgun instructor, who operated the radar from the back seat of F-14s starting in the early 1980s, puts it, “We felt like rocket men flying this thing.” The back seat is what made the F-14 an especially good vehicle for a movie: Maverick has a Goose, and you can have a friendship and a death and an emotional arc.</p><p>  以及涉及的飞机。我个人的事实是F-14是有史以来最激进，最恐怖的飞机。当我第一次在剧院里看到《壮志凌云》时，我才13岁。我的录音带是盒式磁带。也许开放的场景也被刻蚀到您的神经网络中，随着雄猫在驾驶舱中的鸣叫声，上世纪80年代的合成和弦迅速上升。然后，加力燃烧器在黎明的晨曦中爆炸成生命，然后东西冲入大气。它可以说是电影的明星，甚至不嚼口香糖或脱掉衬衫。正如前海军飞行官员兼Topgun教练戴夫·巴兰内克（Dave Baranek）所说，他从1980年代初期开始就在F-14的后座上操作雷达，“我们感觉就像是火箭弹的人在飞这东西。”后排座椅使F-14成为电影的特别出色的工具：小牛拥有一只鹅，您可以拥有友谊，死亡和情感。</p><p>  One of the things that made the plane so revolutionary was its wing sweep abilities. The Navy had wanted a plane that could go faster than Mach 2 but still be an agile dogfighter, easy (ish) to land on an aircraft carrier, and able, also, to fly relatively slowly so it could growl around the ocean on patrol. A wing that changes position enables this. Check out the scene in  Top Gun where Maverick turns to head home after a dogfight. His wings are out and he’s kind of floating slow in the air there. Then the wings sweep back and he zooms to the aircraft carrier. When it’s time to land on that harrowingly short runway, the wings swing out for a lower landing speed that gives the pilots a fraction more time to react.</p><p>  使飞机如此革命性的事情之一是其机翼后掠能力。海军曾希望这架飞机的速度可以比2马赫快，但仍然是敏捷的战斗机，易于（有点）降落在航空母舰上，并且能够相对缓慢地飞行，因此可以在海上巡逻时咆哮。改变位置的机翼可以做到这一点。看看《壮志凌云》中的场面，小牛在打架之后转头回家。他的翅膀向外张开，他有点像在空中飘荡。然后机翼向后掠去，他放大了航母。当需要降落在那段令人痛苦的短跑道上时，机翼会摆动以降低降落速度，从而使飞行员有更多的时间做出反应。</p><p>  The F-14 wasn’t the first plane to have wings that changed position. The long-snouted F-111, which started flying in the late ’60s, allowed the pilot to shift its wings mid-flight, grasping a lever on his left-hand side and sloooowly sliding it back. The F-14 wings adjusted themselves automatically—largely thanks to the Central Air Data Computer designed by the Garrett AiResearch team of two dozen engineers, including Bill and Ray.</p><p>  F-14并不是首架机翼改变位置的飞机。 F-111一直受到人们的青睐，于60年代后期开始飞行，它使飞行员能够在飞行途中移动机翼，抓住左手的操纵杆，然后向后滑动。 F-14机翼可自动调整，这主要归功于Garrett AiResearch团队由包括Bill和Ray在内的20名工程师设计的中央空气数据计算机。</p><p> (I am an unabashed apologist for the Blue Angels’ F-18 Hornets that buzz the San Francisco office every year before Fleet Week. Next-generation ultra-octane fighter jet, yes, but still.)</p><p> （我是“蓝色天使” F-18大黄蜂的坚定辩护者，每年在“舰队周”之前，都在旧金山办公室里嗡嗡作响。下一代超辛烷值战斗机是，但仍然如此。）</p><p>  On Ray’s first day of work at Garrett, in Torrance, California, the personnel manager walked him over to a box and took off its lid. Inside was what looked like a big heavy transmission. “It was quite pretty, gears and cams and gold and silver or chrome,” Ray says. He was looking at a mechanical flight computer for an F-4 Phantom. You are the only person in your department to have taken a computer design class, the man said. Your job is to turn this into a 100 percent electronic computer for a new airplane.</p><p>  在Ray在加利福尼亚州托伦斯的Garrett工作的第一天，人事经理将他带到一个盒子里，然后取下盖子。里面似乎是一个巨大的重型变速器。雷说：“齿轮，凸轮，金，银或铬非常漂亮。”他当时正在寻找一架F-4 Phantom的机械飞行计算机。那个人说，您是部门中唯一参加计算机设计课程的人。您的工作是将其转变为用于新飞机的100％电子计算机。</p><p> It’s fall 2020, and Ray is sitting in a workshop explaining to me how you design a microprocessor. Black metal-frame shelves to his right are filled with bins and boxes; wrenches dangle like piano keys from a wooden workbench behind him. Genial, kind, encouraging, supersmart, in wire-rimmed glasses, Ray often wears one of several Ole’ Miss baseball caps, but not today. He’s at Wilkinson County Christian Academy, where he teaches subjects like computer science, electronics, and drafting. An array of orange tubs at the back of the room holds resistors, capacitors, wire, and other tinkerer’s bits and pieces. “We are trying to find out what the kids are really interested in,” he says. “Some like to build, some like to program, some like electricity.”</p><p> 2020年秋天，雷坐在车间里，向我解释了如何设计微处理器。他右边的黑色金属架子上摆满了箱子和盒子。扳手像钢琴键一样从他身后的木制工作台上垂下。雷恩（Ray）戴着金属丝眼镜，是一种温柔，友善，令人鼓舞，超级聪明的人，经常戴几只Ole’Miss棒球帽之一，但今天却不戴。他在威尔金森县基督教学院任教，教授计算机科学，电子学和制图等科目。房间后面的一排橙色浴缸用来盛放电阻器，电容器，电线和其他修补匠的零配件。他说：“我们正在尝试找出孩子们真正感兴趣的东西。” “有些喜欢建造，有些喜欢编程，有些喜欢电力。” </p><p>  He glances down from the Zoom screen and then holds up a sketch of what looks like a sideways family tree of ovals and lines connecting and branching out. Each of these logic gates represents a mathematical operation inside the computer, which takes information about air speed and temperature and altitude gathered by probes on the nose and belly of the plane, feeds it to quartz analog sensors inside the Central Air Data Computer box, and turns it into digital information.</p><p>他从“缩放”屏幕上向下看了一眼，然后举起了一张看起来像是椭圆形的侧面家谱的草图，这些椭圆形的线条和线条相互连接并分支。这些逻辑门中的每一个都代表计算机内部的数学运算，该运算获取有关飞机机头和腹部上的探针收集的空气速度，温度和高度的信息，并将其馈送到中央空气数据计算机箱内的石英模拟传感器，然后将其转化为数字信息。</p><p> Ray walks me through how he and the team developed the system. One guy would work out the math, another would do the big-picture system design. Ray focused on the detailed implementation, sketching it out on paper. They built a physical prototype that put all the circuits in place. Bill programmed the Fortran simulator that helped check the team’s work. Along the way, the manufacturer, a company called AMI, would assess the prototype. “They would say, well, we think the design will work, but the chips won’t work because they&#39;re too big, or they&#39;re going to get too hot,” he explains to me. “They&#39;re not going to be reliable. So you&#39;re gonna have to change this part.” And the guys would go back and change the paper design and the prototyping and Bill would run the simulation again and they’d iterate until AMI said they’d be able to manufacture it.</p><p> 雷向我介绍了他和团队如何开发该系统。一个人会计算数学，另一个人会做大图系统设计。 Ray专注于详细的实现，并在纸上画了草图。他们建立了一个物理原型，将所有电路都放置到位。 Bill对Fortran仿真器进行了编程，以帮助检查团队的工作。在此过程中，制造商（一家名为AMI的公司）将评估原型。他对我解释说：“他们会说，嗯，我们认为设计会奏效，但是芯片不会奏效，因为它们太大了，或者它们会变得太热。”他们不会可靠。因此，您将不得不更改此部分。”伙计们将返回并更改纸张设计，然后制作原型，Bill将再次运行模拟，然后反复进行迭代，直到AMI表示他们可以制造为止。</p><p>  The Central Air Data Computer allowed co-processing, which means you could shove math calculations off onto other chips. It ran, Ray told me, what is called pipeline execution of instructions—the next instruction could be started while the previous instruction was being completed. Plus, it could have been configured with multiple CPUs, if you wanted, and it was fully self-contained. This all meant it was flexible and expandable, and it was powerful and reliable and there wasn’t anything like it in the world at the time.</p><p>  中央空气数据计算机允许进行协同处理，这意味着您可以将数学计算推到其他芯片上。 Ray告诉我，它运行了所谓的指令流水线执行-下一条指令可以在上一条指令完成时开始。另外，如果需要，它可能已经配置了多个CPU，并且完全是独立的。这一切都意味着它既灵活又可扩展，既强大又可靠，当时世界上还没有类似的东西。</p><p>  When they were kids, the boys “fought like brothers”: Bill would hide around corners and jump out and scare Ray. Once Ray knocked Bill&#39;s teeth out with a broom. But of their time at Garrett, Ray says, “Those were our best years together. We had lots of time to share intellectually—and play flag football.”</p><p>  当他们还是孩子的时候，男孩们“像兄弟一样战斗”：比尔会躲在角落里，跳出来吓scar雷。雷一扫帚就把比尔的牙齿knock掉了。雷说，但在他们在加勒特（Garrett）期间，“这些是我们在一起最好的时光。我们有很多时间可以进行思想上的分享-踢旗足球。”</p><p>  Ray served as best man when Bill and Sally got married in May 1970. The couple rented a little bungalow on 34th Street in Santa Monica for $250 a month, and sometimes a Garrett colleague and friend of Bill’s, another engineer named John, would stop by. Things were good.</p><p>  当Bill和Sally于1970年5月结婚时，Ray担任伴郎。这对夫妇在圣莫尼卡第34街租了一个小平房，每月租金250美元，有时Garrett的同事和Bill的朋友，另一位工程师John停下来。一切都很好。</p><p>  Bill was in the office one Saturday in September, working on a parabolic reflector project with John, when he had a seizure and passed out. John found him on the floor. Bill was diagnosed with a brain tumor the size of a baseball. He died a week later, and the funeral service was held at the church where he and Sally had gotten married. The same people were there; the wedding party acted as pallbearers.</p><p>  比尔在九月的一个星期六在办公室，与约翰一起进行抛物线反射器项目，当时他癫痫发作并去世。约翰发现他在地板上。比尔被诊断出患有棒球般大小的脑瘤。一周后，他去世了，葬礼在他和萨利结婚的教堂举行。同样的人在那里。婚礼派对担当晚会。</p><p> Sally had enrolled in a masters program at UCLA, and her first day of class was the day after Bill died. I cannot imagine the will it took to get in the car and drive there. She parked about a mile away from her classes and had to walk across campus, past the cheerleaders and the football field. “I thought to myself, well, the test is going to be if I can make this walk and hear all these things and smell the grass and not burst into tears,” she says.</p><p> 萨莉（Sally）在加州大学洛杉矶分校（UCLA）攻读硕士学位，而她上课的第一天就是比尔（Bill）去世的第二天。我无法想象要开车上车去那里要花多少时间。她停在离课室约一英里的地方，不得不走过校园，经过啦啦队和足球场。她说：“我心想，好吧，考验是否是我能走这条路，听到所有这些东西，闻到草的味道，而不会泪流满面。” </p><p>  I had known about Bill; I had known he died. But Sally never told me about this day, when she’d had to engineer her own way through awful sadness, until now. It’s piercing: Writing a story for WIRED about Ray, this low-key not-uncle, seems to revive this gleaming not-father who once stood with Sally in the doorway to a different life that never happened.</p><p>我知道比尔；我知道他死了。但是Sally从来没有告诉过我这一天，那时她不得不通过自己的方式来度过可怕的悲伤，直到现在。令人震惊：为WIRED撰写有关雷的故事，这个低调的叔叔，似乎使这位闪闪发光的非父亲复活，他曾经与Sally站在门口，经历了从未有过的另一种生活。</p><p>   “It will be … a fighter—a dogfighter in the old tradition. It will turn and roll with the best of them, even at supersonic speeds, keep up with most of them straight-and-level, and outshoot any of them with guns, rockets and missiles. It will fly fast and it will fly long.</p><p>   “这将是……一个战斗机-古老的传统中的战斗机。即使在超音速下，它也能以最好的状态转动和滚动，保持它们大部分的水平和水平，并用枪，火箭和导弹超越它们中的任何一个。它会飞快，会飞很长。</p><p> In short, the F-14 is an air-superiority fighter, designed to clear the skies of anything that might threaten the fleet.”</p><p> 简而言之，F-14是空中优势战斗机，旨在清除天空中任何可能威胁机队的东西。”</p><p> And the Central Air Data Computer worked. Three years ago, Ray spoke to a non-commissioned officer who had been in charge of maintenance for the F-14s and she told him that they never changed out the technology.</p><p> 中央航空数据计算机也开始工作了。三年前，雷与一名负责F-14维修的军官交谈，她告诉他他们从未改变过这种技术。</p><p>  It was a terrific breakthrough, to have turned a mechanical thing into an electronic device, especially one that was so rugged and accurate and dependable and could perform at the extreme temperatures and stress levels required by the military. But Garrett then simply turned to the next contract; it made lots of aerospace systems, for lots of customers. NASA even.</p><p>  将机械的东西变成电子设备，这是一个了不起的突破，特别是一种坚固，准确，可靠并且可以在军方要求的极端温度和压力水平下运行的电子设备。但是加勒特然后只是求助于下一份合同。它为许多客户制造了许多航空航天系统。美国宇航局甚至。</p><p>  Ray wrote a paper called “ Architecture of a Microprocessor,” for  Computer Design magazine, but the Navy and Garrett didn’t want it published. Security reasons. Indeed, one of the hardest things for Ray after Bill died was the fact that the F-14 project was secret. Which meant Bill’s part in it was secret. “I had no opportunity to brag about Bill&#39;s contribution,” Ray says.</p><p>  雷为《计算机设计》杂志撰写了一篇名为“微处理器的体系结构”的论文，但海军和加勒特不希望将其发表。安全原因。确实，比尔去世后，对于雷而言，最难的事情之一就是F-14计划是秘密的。这意味着比尔的参与是秘密的。雷说：“我没有机会自夸比尔的贡献。”</p><p> My mother stayed in touch with Bill and Ray’s parents over the years. Their father, Mark, would garden with Sally in the months after Bill died. Mark was part Cherokee, and he was very proud of that fact. “He would never say he was from Oklahoma,” Ray says. “He would say, ‘I’m from the Cherokee Nation.’” Before Oklahoma became a state, nation members were offered an allotment of land, typically between 80 and 160 acres, a large portion of which the government took back over the ensuing decades. Mark was part of a class action lawsuit against the government, and when Ray was in high school Mark got a check. A dollar an acre. He tore it up. “He never talked again about Oklahoma.”</p><p> 这些年来，我的母亲一直与Bill和Ray的父母保持联系。比尔去世后的几个月，他们的父亲马克与萨莉一起园艺。马克是切诺基的一分子，他为此感到非常自豪。 “他永远不会说自己来自俄克拉荷马州，”雷说。 “他会说，'我来自切诺基国家。'”在俄克拉荷马州成为州之前，向成员国提供了一块土地，通常为80到160英亩，这其中很大一部分是政府收回来的几十年。马克是针对政府的集体诉讼的一部分，当雷在读高中时，马克得到了一张支票。一英亩一英亩。他撕毁了它。 “他再也没有谈论俄克拉荷马州。” </p><p> Ray designed other microprocessors for other companies; in the early ’70s he and his business partner contracted with Intel to teach other engineers how to use the 4004 and the 8008— that was a little weird. And here’s a cool thing: He also designed a flexible and easy-to-program single-board computer called the Sym. Bart Everett, who ultimately became the technical director for robotics at the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacific, used it inside two sentry robots he built called Robart I and Robart II. The next generation, Robart III, was “one of the most significant autonomous systems in the world,” he says. Kind of an early precursor to (if you squint your eyes and don’t trace the family tree too assiduously) much more famous and advanced machines, like the Boston Dynamics robots. Ray was a vice president at Honeywell for a while. He did some consulting. And when he retired, he went to Oklahoma to see his family’s land. He spent eight years there, visiting the houses his family had lived in, and when he found the deed to his family’s original plot, he went there too. It’s some kind of Army training center now, so he couldn’t go on it. He just looked over the fence to see the land that should have been his.</p><p>雷为其他公司设计了其他微处理器；在70年代初，他和他的商业伙伴与英特尔签约，教其他工程师如何使用4004和8008，这有点奇怪。这是一件很酷的事情：他还设计了一种灵活且易于编程的单板计算机，称为Sym。最终成为太平洋航天和海军作战系统中心太平洋地区机器人技术总监的巴特·埃弗里特（Bart Everett）在他所建造的两个哨兵机器人中使用了该机器人，这两个哨兵机器人分别是Robart I和Robart II。他说，下一代Robart III是“世界上最重要的自治系统之一”。较早的先驱（如果您着眼睛而又不刻意追踪家谱）则是更著名的和先进的机器，例如Boston Dynamics机器人。雷曾在霍尼韦尔（Honeywell）担任副总裁一段时间。他做了一些咨询。当他退休时，他去了俄克拉荷马州看他家人的土地。他在那里呆了八年，参观了他家人住过的房屋，当他发现了他家人最初的住所事迹时，也去了那里。现在是某种陆军训练中心，所以他不能继续。他只是看着篱笆，看看应该是他的土地。</p><p> When Ray was about to leave Oklahoma, he got a call from an old friend, Dolphus Weary, a pastor and racial justice advocate. He asked if maybe Ray, who had founded a group called Christian Athletic Association back in 1977, would come down for a little while and help local Christian ministries build websites. (The way Weary tells it, Ray is the one who called him—history is told a number of different ways.)</p><p> Ray即将离开俄克拉荷马州时，他接到了一位老朋友Dolphus Weary的电话，Dolphus Weary是一位牧师兼种族正义倡导者。他问雷，也许早在1977年就成立了一个名为“基督教运动协会”的组织的雷先生会撤职一段时间，并帮助当地的基督教政府部门建立网站。 （疲倦的告诉方式，雷是给他打电话的人-历史被告知了许多不同的方式。）</p><p>  So Ray moved to Mississippi. He was supposed to be there for a year; that was a decade ago. He got his master’s in education and established Mississippi Robotics, which runs after-school programs for kids all over the state, holding robot competitions twice a year. He teaches engineering classes. Liz Patin, a teacher who works with Ray often, told me that Ray is most passionate about the underdogs, and being sure kids don’t get discounted and left behind. “Just finding something that a kid can do well, and promoting it, and making sure that the kid is aware of it. You think you can go conquer the world after you talk to him.” She calls the kids “little Ray Holts.” I love that.</p><p>  因此，雷搬到了密西西比州。他应该在那里呆一年；那是十年前。他获得了硕士学位，并建立了密西西比机器人技术公司，该公司为全州的孩子们提供课后计划，每年举办两次机器人比赛。他教授工程课。经常与雷合作的老师利兹·帕汀（Liz Patin）告诉我，雷对失败者最热衷，并确保孩子们不会被打折和落伍。 “只要找到一个孩子可以做得好的事情，并加以推广，并确保孩子意识到这一点。您认为与他交谈后就可以征服世界。”她称这些孩子为“小雷·霍尔茨”。我喜欢那个。</p><p>  Was the Central Air Data Computer the first microprocessor? Well, histories are complicated. In 1998, Ray finally got clearance from the Navy to tell people about it, and  The Wall Street Journal published a piece titled “Yet Another &#39;Father&#39; of the Microprocessor Wants Recognition From the Chip Industry.” The Intel engineers who share the title told the paper that the Central Air Data Computer was bulky, it was expensive, it wasn’t a general purpose device. One expert said it was not a microprocessor because of how the processing was distributed among the chips. Another—Russell Fish—said it was, noting, “The company that had this technology could have become Intel. It could have accelerated the microprocessor industry at the time by five years.&#34; But other people around that time also wanted to claim the title of father of the microprocessor; there were some  big patent fights, and not everyone even agrees on the exact  definition of a microprocessor in the first place.</p><p>  中央空气数据计算机是第一个微处理器吗？好吧，历史很复杂。 1998年，雷终于从海军上获通行证，向人们讲述了这件事，《华尔街日报》发表了一篇题为《又一个父亲》的文章。微处理器部门希望获得芯片行业的认可。”共享标题的英特尔工程师告诉该报纸，中央航空数据计算机体积庞大，价格昂贵，而且不是通用设备。一位专家说，这不是微处理器，因为处理是如何在芯片之间分配的。另一位代表拉塞尔·菲什（Russell Fish）表示，他指出：“拥有这项技术的公司可以成为英特尔。它可能在当时将微处理器产业加速了五年。＆＃34;但是那时其他人也想声称微处理器的父亲的头衔。发生了一些大规模的专利斗争，但并不是所有人都首先同意微处理器的确切定义。</p><p> “The discussion,” says Fish, who today runs an  IP licensing company called Venray, “is not a technical one, it is a philosophical one.” Fish at one point wrote that the 4-bit 4004 could “count to 16,” while the 20-bit CADC “was evaluating sixth order polynomial expressions rapidly enough to move the control surfaces of a dogfighting swing-wing supersonic fighter.” When I spoke to him recently, he said he had gone back and read through the documentation. “What Ray Holt did was absolutely brilliant,” he says. “Particularly given the timeframe. Ray was generations ahead, algorithmically and computationally.”</p><p> 如今经营着一家名为Venray的IP许可公司的Fish表示：“这种讨论不是技术性的，而是哲学性的。” Fish一时写道，4位4004可能“计数为16”，而20位CADC“正在迅速评估六阶多项式表达式，以使格斗式摆动翼超音速战斗机的控制面移动。”当我最近与他交谈时，他说他已经回去阅读了文档。他说：“雷·霍尔特（Ray Holt）的所作所为绝对出色。” “特别给出了时间表。 Ray在算法和计算上都领先于下一代。”</p><p> Official histories have </p><p> 官方历史有</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/secret-history-of-the-first-microprocessor-f-14/">https://www.wired.com/story/secret-history-of-the-first-microprocessor-f-14/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/微处理器/">#微处理器</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ray/">#ray</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
