The best features of iOS 14 like Home Screen widgets and App Library are coming to iPads. That means you can put the Weather widget directly on your Home Screen just like on the iPhone. Widgets update with new information like temperature and forecast, and tapping a widget launches the app just like tapping an icon\u2026\n  Apple\u2019s Weather app has a brand new design on iOS 15 that organizes data points like humidity and UV index into blocks. It\u2019s really great on the iPhone at presenting a lot of information without being overwhelming.\n For some reason, Apple\u2019s Weather app on iPadOS 15 doesn\u2019t have exactly the same design. Information is still organized into blocks, but a lot of the blocks are weirdly not about weather conditions.\n The top of the Weather app for iPad includes a giant banner for a subscription version with more features and fewer ads. I missed the announcement about a paid version of the Weather app, but Apple is really into services these days so it\u2019s no surprise.\n  Weird Weather+ announcement aside, the Weather app for iPad is just as useful as the new Weather app for iPhone. It\u2019s actually even better in some ways.\n The Weather app for iPad includes all the great data points like humidity, visibility, and UV index just like on the iPhone. There\u2019s even a cool section for telling you the current phase of the Moon. How cool!\n  Something else unique about the Weather app for iPad is a neat tidbit about UPS. According to the Weather app for iPad, you can save 50% on global shipping with code REACH from now through July 19. I couldn\u2019t find this curious but helpful data point on the Weather app for iPhone. Now I\u2019m worried folks who check the weather on their iPhone are overpaying for shipping.\n  The perks of Apple\u2019s Weather app for iPad don\u2019t end there. You can confirm your suspicion that the yellow stuff covering your car is actually pollen. I live a few minutes from the beach so it\u2019s also good to see tide levels. That\u2019s the power of iPad, people.\n  The Weather app for iPad also features some really cool photo galleries of weather conditions around the world. These are attached to weather-related news stories sort of like how Stocks has business-related news stories, but stories in the iPad Weather app don\u2019t use Apple News for some reason.\n You can also learn about innovative ways to cut your grass with the Weather app on iPad. Top that, iPhone Weather app. This section of the Weather app for iPad will also stop any audio playing from your device \u2014 presumably part of the new Focus feature.\n  Weather news isn\u2019t the only kind of stories you can learn about in the Weather app for iPad. There\u2019s an adorable puppy story, a suggestion for attaching a pop-up tent to your car, and something about turning your room into a fridge. Fascinating!\n Some of Apple\u2019s Weather app for iPad is particularly not very Apple-y, but this is definitely Apple\u2019s Weather app for iPad. It launches every time you tap the Weather widget, and that\u2019s just how widgets work. It also mentions data vendors and controlling your data. Apple is all about empowering you to own your data and preventing companies from profiting from your information.\n  I tried to learn more about the subscription to Apple\u2019s Weather app for iPad, but I couldn\u2019t find any information about it on Apple\u2019s website. Is it included in the Apple One bundle?\n I\u2019m not sure, but you can use promo code SUMMER to get access for $1/month for 90 days before the price jumps to $5/month! The fine print for the subscription mistakenly mentions something about a website, but this is definitely the Weather app for iPad.\n And before you try to tell me this isn\u2019t the Weather app for iPad, hear me out. The Weather widget launches the Weather app on iPhone, and I\u2019m certain the Weather widget launches the Weather app on iPad. That\u2019s just how widgets work!\n The Weather app for iPhone has some cool new features this year like precipitation alerts, but Apple will probably add those to the Weather for iPad app next year. That\u2019s how widgets worked, after all, right?\n  You\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

", "note_en": "Since 1935, Berlin engineer Konrad Zuse has spent his entire career developing a series of automatic calculators, the first of their kind in the world: the Z1, Z2, Z3, S1, S2, and Z4. He accomplished this with a motley group of engineers, technicians, and mathematicians who were operating against all odds. With all the hardships and shortages of war and the indifference of their peers, the fact that they succeeded at all is a testament to their dedication and resourcefulness. And with the end of the war, more hardships have been piling on.\n Two years ago, during the Battle of Berlin, bombers completely destroyed the Zuse family home and adjacent workshops on the Methfesselstra\u00dfe, where they performed research and fabrication. All of the calculators, engineering drawings, and notes were lost in the rubble, save for the new Z4 nearing completion across the canal in another workshop on Oranienstra\u00dfe. In the midst of all this, Zuse married in January of this year, but was immediately plunged into another crisis when the largest Allied air raid of the war destroyed the Oranienstra\u00dfe workshop in February. They managed to rescue the Z4 from the basement, and miraculously arranged for it to be shipped out of the Berlin. Zuse, his family, and colleagues followed soon thereafter. Here and there along the escape route, they managed to complete the final assembly and testing of the Z4 \u2014 even giving a demonstration to the Aerodynamics Research Institute in G\u00f6ttingen.\n On arrival here in the Bavarian Alps, Zuse found a ragtag collection of refugees, including Dr Werner Von Braun and a team of 100 rocket scientists from Peenem\u00fcnde. While everyone here is struggling just to stay alive and find food and shelter, Zuse is further worried with keeping his invention safe from prying eyes. Tensions have risen further upon circulation of a rumor that an SS leader, after three bottles of Cognac, let slip that his troops aren\u2019t here to protect the\u00a0scientists\u00a0but to kill them all if the Americans or French approach.\n In the midst of all this madness, Zuse and his wife Gisela welcomed a baby boy, and have taken up residence in a Hinterstein farmhouse. Zuse spends his time working on something called a  Plankalk\u00fcl, explaining that it is a mathematical language to allow people to communicate with these new machines. His other hobby is making woodblocks of the local scenery, and he plans to start a company to sell his devices once the economy recovers. There is no doubt that Konrad Zuse will soon be famous and known around the world as the father of automatic computers.\n  It was 80 years ago that  Konrad Zuse demonstrated his model Z3, an appropriate occasion to look back at his life and accomplishments. But despite the musings of our imaginary correspondent above, most people outside of computer history buffs have never heard of Konrad Zuse. How is it that someone created and built the world\u2019s first programmable computer and yet is only a footnote in history?\n Konrad Zuse had trouble finding his niche in life. As a young teen he seemed destined to become an engineer based on his interests and skills, always tinkering with erector sets and inventing gadgets. But he was also a talented sketch artist, photographer, and enjoyed acting in skits and plays. During his time at the  Technical University of Berlin, he changed majors twice. Initially put off by the rigid conformity of mechanical engineering, he switched to architecture, only to find it equally boring. He finally settled on civil engineering, which struck the right balance between engineer and artist.\n  After completing his studies in 1935, his first job was at the Henschel Airplane Works just outside of Berlin. But he quit after only a few months, turning his attention to something he had been pondering for some time \u2014 could he build a machine to automate those boring and repetitious engineering calculations?\n  Zuse was working in almost complete isolation from others in the nascent field of computing. And initially, at least, he wasn\u2019t so much focused on a general purpose computer as we think of it today. His goal was to make an automated mechanical adding machine of sorts, to handle the tedious calculations such as those required in static stress analyses. Early on, he made a key decision to use binary rather than decimal. He rightly saw that this would greatly simplify the building of such a machine, no matter what the implementation.\n You might think that the choice of binary numbers would immediately make relays the most obvious choice. And while he did experiments with relays, they were ruled too unreliable. Today we take for granted the reliability and quality of relays, but Zuse was living in 1930s Germany and operating on a shoestring budget supported by his family and friends. Relays were expensive, and they were designed to switch infrequently, not run continuously at many Hertz. The relays that he could obtain were more often than not discards his friends rescued from the trash at the local telephone exchange. Along with his friend Helmut Schreyer, they also experimented with using of vacuum tubes, but realized that technology would be significantly delayed due to wartime shortages.\n  So how did he implement a computer without relays or vacuum tubes? It was all mechanical. Zuse devised a clever arrangement of plates, flat bars, and steel pins to make a digital memory store and a floating point binary arithmetic logic unit (ALU).\n  This  video explains the basic operation of the mechanical adder (don\u2019t let the fact that it\u2019s in German discourage you from watching it).\n If you want to dig into how Zuse implemented memory and an ALU mechanically, check out [fjkraan]\u2019s project explaining  the basics and OpenSCAD 3D printer examples you can make yourself:\n   The memory consisted of 64 each 22-bit words ( 14-bits of mantissa and 8-bits of exponent and sign). The ALU could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The program instructions were provided on punched tapes, and consisted of only eight operations:\n  The computer\u2019s clock was equivalent to a four-phase CPU clock of modern times. But it was mechanical rather than electrical, and could be driven by either a hand crank or an electric motor. Each clock phase was one of four planar motions \u2014 imagine pushing a square plate a few centimeters North, then West, then South, then East back to the starting point. Each phase performed a basic operation, and fortunately no basic operation took more than three of these cycles.\n As hinted to by the instruction set, Zuse also built converters to permit the use of human-friendly decimal numbers for input and output. Paper tape was too rare a commodity at the time, so another solution was needed. They found that blank 35 mm movie film worked just fine, and wrote their programs using a hand-held hole punch.\n  The Z1 was finished in 1938, but was never very reliable. But it\u00a0wasn\u2019t meant to be a finished product, only a proof-of-concept prototype. Work next began on the Z2, which was planned to test whether relays could would be suitable. Zuse kept the mechanical memory for the Z2, but replaced the ALU with a relay version, but only operating on fixed-point numbers. It was completed and successfully demonstrated in 1938, whereupon Zuse received partial funding to build a successor model.\n The Z3 was designed entirely with relays. It was basically an improvement on the Z1, was faster and more reliable. It was delivered and demonstrated on 12 May 1941, and then Zuse began construction of yet another computer, the Z4 mentioned in the introduction. The Z4 expanded on the Z3, adding new features like square root, punch tape output, multiple tape input units, and a conditional branch instruction. Zuse continued to use relays in the ALU, but returned to the mechanical memory because of its greater density. The Z4 was eventually put into full time service and operated from 1950 until 1959.\n  As the Z3 project was underway, a request came from Henschel for help in the production of guided missile wings. Zuse built what are probably the first process control computers, the S1 and S2, and invented an analog to digital converter. These single-purpose computers followed the contour of newly-manufactured wings as a hundred analog-to-digital-equipped rollers measured their curvatures.\n The machines would then automatically calculate the required trim for the tail surfaces and ailerons from this data, a task that previously been done by a dozen computers (people, not machines). After performing their jobs around the clock for two years, the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, and the S1 and S2 were either destroyed or possibly captured by the Soviets.\n If you want to learn more about each model, check out this  extensive website describing all the computers and much more. It was made by Konrad Zuse\u2019s son who was born in the introduction above,  Prof Horst Zuse, who became an electrical engineer, a software engineer, and an expert on computer history.\n  Zuse and his team were able to switch back and forth between mechanical, relay, and even vacuum tube realizations of the computer components because of Zuse\u2019s grasp on the underlying equations at work. He developed his own system of rules and notation, until his former math teacher told him he had reinvented propositional calculus, or Boolean algebra as is more commonly used today. By reducing the computer operations into equations, the design concepts were separated from the physical construction, making it easier to jump back and forth between implementations.\n Zuse realized that with the framework, what we would call a computer language today, the computer could do so much more than just solve equations. He had been thinking of such a language since 1939, and in the immediate aftermath of the war, he spent much of his time formalizing what he called  Plankalk\u00fcl, the first high-level programming language for a computer \u2014 in English, it translates as  a formal system for planning. Despite Zuse\u2019s high hopes, Plankalk\u00fcl never took off, although some say that elements of it can be found in Algol 58, albeit uncredited.\n   Zuse made patent applications for many of his inventions, and a number of patents were issued. His patent for the computer itself, would be frustrated. He filed a patent application on 16 Jun 1941. It wasn\u2019t until after the war in 1952 that the German Patent Office  published his claims. No company in the whole industry objected, except for one \u2014 the  Triumph calculator company filed opposition to the patent, later revealed to be backed by IBM. The court case lingered for years, only to ultimately be rejected in 1967 on the grounds that the invention was not worthy of a patent.\n The innovation and progressiveness of the object concerned in the main application are not doubted. Yet a patent cannot be granted due to insufficient inventive merit.\n In the meantime, Zuse had begun commercializing his own line of computers. There was a false start with IBM, who wanted the patents but wouldn\u2019t let Zuse continue development.  Remington Rand became an important early client, followed closely by the  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Z\u00fcrich who took delivery of the Z4 in 1950.\u00a0Business grew over the next 15 years, with a series of computers and even a plotter,  the Graphomat 64. But by the mid 1960s the company was having financial troubles, and it was acquired by Siemens in 1967.\n  As with many historical computers that have been destroyed or sold for scrap, there have been several recreations of Zuse\u2019s computers built over the years.\n  With support from Siemens, Zuse began a project in 1984 to reconstruct the Z1. It was completed in 1989 and is  now on display at the  German Museum of Technology in Berlin. Prof Ra\u00fal Rojas of the Free University of Berlin has written an  excellent, in-depth paper on how the Z1 and its reconstruction work. Regarding this project, Zuse once remarked:\n Back then, it didn\u2019t function very well, and in that regard, this replica is very reliable \u2014 it also doesn\u2019t work well.\n  The relay-based Z3 has been reconstructed three times. First, in 1961, Zuse himself built a replica that is still on display in the  Deutsches Museum in Munich. Again in 1997, Profs Ra\u00fal Rojas and Horst Zuse built a recreation that is now on display  Konrad Zuse Museum in H\u00fcnfeld, Germany. And most recently, Prof Horst Zuse built an original size reconstruction which was installed at the Konrad Zuse museum in 2010.\n  And speaking of replicas, this is a replica of Konrad Zuse himself, in the form of a LEGO brick man, holding a relay storage unit from the Z3 computer.\n   Zuse had the misfortune to have made his most important invention in times of war. Otherwise, the practical, entrepreneurial Zuse might be known today not only as a technology pioneer, but also as the founder of a global technology corporation of the stature of Bill Gates.\n It does make you wonder why Konrad Zuse isn\u2019t well known and why his groundbreaking inventions and computers are often ignored. Whether or not he made the first programmable computer, his contributions were undeniably significant, well ahead of their time, and deserve better recognition. Konrad Zuse\u2019s accomplishments are best summarized by Eric Weiss, who wrote  Zuse\u2019s obituary\u00a0for the IEEE in 1996 :\n Zuse was a man of many talents. He was a persistent, innovative, and extraordinarily creative engineering designer and builder, a mathematical logician, the founder of several successful computing manufacturing businesses, and an impressive artist.

", "note_en": "Here at Ars, we&#39;re big fans of situations where emulation creates a classic gaming experience that&#39;s actually  better than what you could get with original hardware in some way or another. In the past, that has meant  upsampling rotated sprites in SNES&#39; &#34;Mode 7&#34; games or  adding &#34;widescreen&#34; support to NES games or  mitigating the controller lag that was built into certain older consoles or  overclocking an emulated SNES to remove slowdown without ruining gameplay timing. The latest emulation-powered retro-gaming upgrade to cross our paths greatly simplifies an oft-overlooked capability built in to many Game Boy Advance titles. Namely, it adds the ability to play multiplayer titles in split screen on a single display.\n This upgrade is the work of  Robert Peip, a developer who&#39;s spent years working on  field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). These days, Peip works primarily on  the MiSTer FPGA an open source project that recreates classic gaming hardware extremely accurately through emulation &#34;cores&#34; that replicate every single logic gate involved in the schematics of the original system (most of  Analogue&#39;s high-end retro hardware is similarly powered by FPGA cores). Such cores are  currently available for consoles ranging from the Odyssey 2 through the  Neo Geo era and more.\n Peip&#39;s new &#34;special version&#34; of  the Game Boy Advance FPGA core works relatively simply, running two GBA cores in a single MiSTer. As Peip explains, &#34;you get 2 raw GBA cores, one connected to SDRAM, one connected to DDR3, communicating directly inside the FPGA. Sound is used from Core 1 only.&#34;\n     Thus, games originally designed to be played on two consoles connected via link cable can now be played in split screen on a single MiSTer with a single connected display, as shown  in this demonstration video. Peip says that &#34;most multiplayer games should be supported,&#34; a statement that presumably includes original Game Boy games (which work on a GBA link-cable through a supported secondary mode). Playing these multiplayer GBA games on original hardware required two separate consoles, two copies of the game, and a GBA link cable, ensuring most casual players probably never even bothered (some GBA games offered limited multiplayer with just one cartridge). And while previous GBA emulators  have offered link-cable support, even that required a LAN or Internet connection between two separate machines with two separate displays. While some RetroPie users have  done a bit of finagling to get multiplayer games for the original Game Boy working via split screen, we&#39;ve never seen a similar one-machine, one-display solution for Game Boy Advance multiplayer games before this.\n Peip&#39;s turnkey test core for multiplayer GBA emulation is currently only available by  supporting his Patreon, and it is currently missing features like savestates, fast forward, and visual filters available on other GBA cores. Still, we&#39;re excited to have a new, easier-to-use method to try the oft-ignored multiplayer modes in some classic portable titles.

Qidni Labs was founded in 2014, has raised $1.5 million and is currently in the due diligence process leading up to another round of funding. Qidni Labs was also an   award winner  at the 2019 KidneyX Summit for developing an air removal system for a wearable renal therapy device.\n The jackets are a prototype of Qidni\u2019s mobile hemodialysis machine called Qidni/D. The idea behind Qidni/D is that it will be significantly smaller than a traditional hemodialysis setup and use fewer fluids, allowing patients to be more mobile.\n  \u201cWe see this device, and this technology, to be a bridge to a blood purification technology that allows the patients to be mobile, although we do not anticipate that to be the first product,\u201d says Morteza Ahmadi, the founder and CEO of Qidni Labs.\n Per the CDC , about one in seven people in the US have some type of chronic kidney disease. Over time, that could progress kidney failure, at which point it\u2019s recommended that patients start dialysis or receive a transplant. That threshold is typically   symptom based ; people might experience weight loss, shortness of breath or an irregular pulse to name a few symptoms.\n There are two major types of dialysis: hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis passes blood through a filter and a liquid called dialysate, whereas peritoneal dialysis inserts fluid into the body, which absorbs toxins, then drains it out. Qidni/D is a hemodialysis machine that can fit into a sheep sized jacket, and uses its own cartridges and gel-based system to cut down on the amount of liquid needed to perform dialysis. (TechCrunch reviewed images of the device).\n In an early animal trial \u2013 the results of which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal \u2013 the device was able to reduce levels of urea in sheep\u2019s blood at the threshold of an   adequate dose of traditional dialysis . TechCrunch reviewed data from the study over Zoom.\n  These sheep had no functioning kidneys, and were hooked up to the machine for between four and eight and a half hours. Morteza adds that the data so far suggests that four hours of treatment should be sufficient to cleanse the sheep\u2019s blood.\n This is just one small animal study, so it\u2019s hard to draw massive conclusions from it. It didn\u2019t include an active control arm, for instance, and instead compared the amount of urea and electrolytes removed from the sheep\u2019s blood to published standards from other studies on dialysis.\n The study alone is far from enough to suggest that the technology is ready for market, but those within the company are taking it as a good sign that the design of Qidni\u2019s mobile dialysis machine bears further testing.\n \u201cWe can say that in this study, we could replace daily dialysis based on the data,\u201d he says.\n The team will continue to tweak the technology in more sheep-based studies this year, and is aiming to begin human trials in 2022. The overall goal is to file for FDA approval, provided that clinical studies can demonstrate safety and efficacy, by the second half of 2023.\n The kidney treatment landscape is dominated by dialysis, which is an onerous treatment \u2013\u00a0despite the fact that a kidney transplant, in many cases, could relieve that burden.\n At the moment, far more people with end stage renal disease are on dialysis than receive kidney transplants.   The CDC estimates  that 786,000 people in the US live with end stage renal failure, of which 71 percent are on dialysis and 29 percent have received transplants.\n The dialysis industry, and in particular Fresenius and DaVita, the two giants that control about   70 percent  of the industry, also has a   controversial and complicated history  of poor performance.\n The kidney treatment landscape is also notable because it\u2019s covered by Medicare, however, it remains expensive. Dialysis and transplants make up about   seven percent  of Medicare\u2019s budget. Because of this complex landscape, startups have been pursuing alternatives like   implantable kidneys .\n Qidni\u2019s current product is not an artificial kidney in that it could live forever in the body of a participant and replace a non-functional organ. Rather, it\u2019s a more mobile take on dialysis. Qidni/D, the blood purification device, is the company\u2019s main focus for the time being.\n  That said, Qidni/D\u00a0 does have some unique elements that may make it as \u201cdisruptive\u201d as Morteza hopes it will be. Namely, its small size, and low water requirements.\n During an average week of dialysis treatment, the average person is exposed to about   300 to 600 liters of water , per the CDC. Some of that water is used in the dialysate solution that helps to leach toxins out of the blood. Per Morteza, Qidni/D uses just one  cup of water per treatment session, most of which is contained with the dialysate solution.\n \u201cIn our understanding, this is probably one of the first times in the world that waterless technology is useful for blood purification over a long period of time in a large animal model,\u201d he says.\n Removing the liquid components of dialysis may streamline an already onerous process. Morteza, for one, hopes that this would make at-home dialysis more attainable (fewer stringent water safety requirements) and limit risks of infection (  water-related infections  sometimes occur during dialysis).\n It\u2019s also a small step towards creating an implantable kidney, which would, ideally, not require massive amounts of external fluid \u2013 though mobile dialysis remains Qidni\u2019s current focus. The company\u2019s upcoming round will be focused on testing their cartridge technology in small human trials.\n \u201cIn this round of funding we would be raising $2.5 million, and that should take us to a point that we can test this technology in a small group of patients, connected to an existing dialysis machine using our own cartridges instead of existing dialysate,\u201d he says.\n It\u2019s ultimately a step towards a machine that functions more like the organ it\u2019s supposed to mimic, though the holy grail for patients is a solution that ends the need for dialysis in the first place.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 05:59:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u900f\u6790,animal", "title": "\u79fb\u52a8\u900f\u6790\u542f\u52a8\u773c\u775b\u5728\u9f13\u52b1\u52a8\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u540e2022\u5e74\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bd5\u9a8c ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMobile dialysis startup eyes human trials in 2022 following encouraging animal study\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/mobile-dialysis-startup-eyes-human-trials-in-2022-following-encouraging-animal-study/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u900f\u6790", "animal"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7fb42ae88c58e2f2b4381818592ae423.png", "infoid": 1066597, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5176\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6536\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6e\u80ce\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u4fdd\u9669\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9500\u552e\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9CANOO\u7684\u5927\u6b21\u507f\u8fd8\u3002\u5982\u679c\u666e\u901a\u7684Canoo\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u62e5\u6709\u53e6\u5916\u4e24\u8f86\u8f66\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u774050,000\u4ef6\u9500\u552e\u7684Canoos\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8fbe15\u4e07\u8f86\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0cCanoo\u7684\u5168\u7403\u5ba2\u6237\u65c5\u7a0b\u548c\u4e9a\u592a\u5c71\u57fa\u7763\u5f92Treiber\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7VP\u3002\n \u201c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u6574\u4f53\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201cCanoo Ecosystem\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u6574\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u8f66\u5e93\u3002\u201d\n  \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u8f66\u8f86 -

If the average Canoo driver owns two other vehicles, that could mean that 50,000 sold Canoos could yield data on up to 150,000 vehicles total, Canoo\u2019s senior VP of global customer journey and aftersales Christian Treiber said.\n \u201cLet\u2019s think about the opportunity overall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Canoo ecosystem, but for the entire customer garage.\u201d\n  For all vehicles \u2013 Canoo or not \u2013 that are hooked into the app, the driver will be able to see details on range and battery life for their EVs, as well as the odometer, miles per gallon, and total range for their internal combustion engine vehicles. Treiber said this could be accomplished simply using an ODB connector.\n \u201cWe know how to translate data in cars, we know how to take that metadata and put in service maintenance, repair and asset information, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve built a multi billion dollar business doing this,\u201d Canoo CEO Tony Aquila told TechCrunch. \u201cSo we can take that data and do that for you. It\u2019s nothing for us on our platform. It\u2019s just an OBD dongle. OEMs spend money on stupid stuff, we\u2019d rather give you a dongle for your second car. If you want to connect it, you can run it all off the same app.\u201d\n Aquila took the helm at Canoo in April, after co-founders Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz departed in June 2020 and April, respectively. ( Kranz was hired by Apple to help with the development of its first car.) Aquila founded Solera Holdings in 2005, a risk management and asset protection software company.\n Canoo\u2019s hoping to use its app to drive revenue in other ways as well. For Canoo cars, drivers can access the Maintenance and Upgrades section to instantly upgrade the horsepower of their vehicle, schedule a service appointment or check for software updates. Up to 94% of the electronic control units will have wireless updating capability. The app will also make predictive wear and tear reminders for when you\u2019ll likely need new tires \u2013 and it will push special offers for these services in advance.\n  Drivers will also be able to order other vehicle upgrades for the Canoo, like a roof rack or floor or seat protection.\n Much of these features \u2013 especially the services for non-Canoo vehicles \u2013 will likely come together through partnerships with service providers, insurance companies and vehicle detailers. Trieber hinted at other potential partnerships as well, such as using the Canoo app as a digital wallet to pay for a meal at a restaurant, for example\n \u201cThe single greatest opportunity for the automotive industry is monetizing data, and we want to be part of it, and we will be part of it,\u201d he said.\n The news was announced during the company\u2019s investor day presentation Thursday, where Aquila also revealed  Oklahoma as the site for its first factory. That location is expected to open in 2023.
