", "note_en": "On May 17, the City Council of Mesa, Arizona, approved the  $800 million development of an enormous data center -- a warehouse filled with computers storing all of the photos, documents and other information we store \u201cin the cloud\u201d -- on an arid plot of land in the eastern part of the city.\n But keeping the rows of powerful computers inside the data center from overheating will require up to 1.25 million gallons of water each day, a price that Vice Mayor Jenn Duff believes is too high.\u201cThis has been the driest 12 months in 126 years,\u201d she said, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWe are on red alert, and I think data centers are an irresponsible use of our water.\u201d\n   Duff was the only Mesa City Council member to vote against  the development. But she\u2019s one of a growing number of people nationwide raising concerns about the proliferation of data centers,  which guzzle electricity and water while creating relatively few jobs, particularly in drought-stricken parts of the United States.\n  The spike in use of data-intensive cloud services such as video conferencing tools, video streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube and online gaming, particularly as people quarantined during the pandemic, has increased demand for the computing power offered by data centers globally. And this means more data centers are being built every day by some of America\u2019s largest technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google and used by millions of customers.  According to the Synergy Research Group, there were about 600 \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers, massive operations designed and operated by a single company that then rents access to cloud services, globally by the end of 2020. That\u2019s double the number there were in 2015. Almost 40 percent of them are in the United States, and  Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of the total.\n The U.S. also has at least 1,800 \u201ccolocation\u201d data centers, warehouses filled with a variety of smaller companies\u2019 server hardware that share the same cooling system, electricity and security, according to  Data Center Map. They are typically smaller than hyperscale data centers but,  research has shown, more resource intensive as they maintain a variety of computer systems operating at different levels of efficiency.\n Many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. Researchers at Virginia Tech estimate that one-fifth of data centers draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds, mostly in the Western United States, according to a  paper published in April.\n  Typically, where data centers are located is based on proximity to customers and infrastructure, the cost of land, the tax incentives offered by local governments and access to low-cost electricity, the researchers said.\n \u201cI am not sure the degree to which environmental considerations are in the decision-making process,\u201d said Landon Marston, lead author of the paper.\n All centers need some form of cooling technology, typically either computer room air-conditioning systems -- essentially large units that cool air with water or refrigerant -- or evaporative cooling, which evaporates water to cool the air. Evaporative cooling uses a lot less electricity, but more water. Since water is cheaper than electricity, data centers tend to opt for the more water-intensive approach.\n The growth in the industry shows no signs of slowing. The research company Gartner predicts that spending on global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion this year, an increase of 6 percent from 2020, followed by 3-4 percent annually over the next three years. This growth comes at a time of record temperatures and drought in the United States,  particularly in the West.\n  \u201cThe typical data center uses about 3-5 million gallons of water per day -- the same amount of water as a city of 30,000-50,000 people,\u201d said Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University.\n  Although these data centers have become  much more energy and water efficient over the last decade, and don\u2019t use as much water as other industries such as agriculture, this level of water use can still create potential competition with local communities over the water supply in areas where water is scarce, he added.\n But some tech companies like Google say they are trying to address their water use.\n \u201cAs part of our water stewardship efforts, we\u2019re working to utilize water more efficiently and exploring ways to incorporate circularity,\u201d said Gary Demasi, senior director of energy and location operations at Google. \u201cWe have a site-specific approach where we work within the constraints of the local hydrological environment to find the best solutions.\u201d\n He added that \u201cmany arid environments provide an abundant supply of carbon-free solar and wind energy,\u201d which explains why data centers are drawn to those areas.\n  Sergio Loureiro, vice president of core operations for Microsoft, said that the company  has pledged to be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030, which means it plans to replenish more water than it consumes globally. This includes reducing the company\u2019s water use and investing in community replenishment and conservation projects near where it builds facilities.\n    In recent years,  tensions over water use by data centers have flared in communities across the United States. In 2017, conservation groups in South Carolina  criticized Google over its request for a permit to draw 1.5 millions of gallons of water per day from a depleted aquifer to cool its expanding data center in Goose Creek. The facility already required 4 million gallons of tap water each day, and residents and conservation groups were concerned about the company\u2019s  impact on the dwindling groundwater supply. After a two-year battle with the South Carolina Coastal Conservation league over the plans, Google reached an agreement to use only groundwater under limited conditions, for example, during maintenance work or as a backup during drier months, and instead pay for an alternative source of surface water from the Charleston Water System.\n  Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said that the company partnered with local community stakeholders and water conservation experts to assess the data center\u2019s impact and conducted studies that showed that even in an \u201cextreme worst-case scenario\u201d the data center\u2019s water use in the area would be sustainable.\n Both companies and consumers need to start treating water conservation as seriously as reducing carbon emissions, experts say.\n   \u201cWe are going to experience a drier and more water-scare future, and every drop of water counts,\u201d said Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Amazon, Microsoft and Google causing these water footprints. But it\u2019s you and me, searching and needing data that ends up in these data centers.\u201d\n Ajami said that water has been historically undervalued as a resource in part because it has been cheap for companies to purchase. While many industries have taken great leaps in reducing their electricity use and carbon footprints, they lag behind in water efficiency throughout their supply chains, she said.\n  \u201cWe often overlook the communities impacted, who are often disadvantaged,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was a wealthy community, maybe they wouldn\u2019t allow the data centers to be built in their backyard.\u201d\n   Water conservation experts say that a key challenge has been the lack of alignment between cities\u2019 economic development plans and their resource conservation efforts. Often the promise of attracting a household-name technology company to build a billion-dollar data center that will bring jobs and investment to the region will override concerns over the water supply.\n  \u201cCities don\u2019t want to tell tech companies that they can\u2019t come to their city because of lack of water,\u201d said Cora Kammeyer, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on water conservation.\n   \u201cWhen it comes to economic development, I don\u2019t think we are fully transparent about the water concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep the image that we are a great place to invest and start a business. But we don\u2019t like to talk about the water.\u201d The Mesa project approved on May 17, which was submitted under the name of a developer called Redale LLC, has been shrouded in secrecy. The name of the company that will run the data center has only been supplied to the city under a nondisclosure agreement, although one Mesa city source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was Facebook. The specialist news site  Data Center Dynamics also reported that it was likely to be Facebook based on similarities in the planning specifications to its other data centers. Facebook declined to comment, and Redale did not respond to a request for comment. The proposed data center will employ an estimated 150 people across three buildings and pay the city millions of dollars in sales tax on the construction and utilities.\n Duff added that even though data centers don\u2019t use as much water as other industries, they are \u201cstill depleting water in the desert, and that is a concern.\u201d\n She noted that this is the \u201ceighth or ninth\u201d data center project in Mesa. The city previously approved a Google facility, currently under construction, that will consume up to 4 million gallons of water per day,  as reported by Bloomberg. The Redale project represents a significant milestone to Mesa\u2019s water supply as it\u2019s the first where the city required the developer to obtain water credits from the Salt River Project to use groundwater in the event that the city can\u2019t meet the data center\u2019s demand for water.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could say we had enough water for the business,\u201d Duff said.\n  Surface water supplies that Arizona uses from Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, and the Colorado River that feeds it, have already  dwindled to their lowest levels ever, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal water management agency. The water level is so low that federal restrictions are likely to be triggered on Arizona\u2019s water allocation from the reservoir, which could happen at the start of 2022. S ix other states in the West could also face such restrictions.\n As that happens, Duff said, more companies will start to draw on their \u201cwater credits\u201d to use groundwater supplies. However,  according to research by Arizona State University, these water credits are over allocated, meaning that if everybody started using them at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough water to go around.\n \u201cWe are very resourceful, but I think we need to wake up,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe analysis shows our safeguards aren\u2019t there and we need to come up with a concrete plan instead of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n   To the south of Mesa, the city of Chandler, Arizona, has taken a different approach. In 2015 the city passed an ordinance that restricted new water-intensive businesses from developing unless they aligned with the city\u2019s plan for economic development. It effectively deters businesses that use a lot of water but don\u2019t create many jobs, including data centers, in favor of those that create thousands of jobs,  such as semiconductor plants.\n  The city\u2019s water resource manager, Gregg Capps, said the ordinance, the first of its kind in the U.S., was introduced as a direct result of discovering in 2013 how much water one of the data centers in the city was using after the company started requesting additional water connections. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them back then, but that brought our attention to their water use,\u201d he said.\n His team took their concerns to the City Council, which spent months developing the ordinance. Since it was adopted in 2015, there have been no new data center developments in Chandler.\n \u201cWater is a strategic resource. It\u2019s important to us,\u201d Capps said.\n   The Silicon Valley technology companies that dominate the hyperscale data center market -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- are conscious of the business and reputational risk associated with data centers\u2019 thirst. All of them have made some progress in reducing their data centers\u2019 water footprint through innovative cooling strategies. These include free-air cooling, which uses fresh outdoor air to cool a space, and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in a liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, taking the heat with it. However, free-air cooling only really works in cooler climates, and immersion was just used  for the first time in a commercial setting by Microsoft in April.\n  Some companies,  including Microsoft have developed underwater or partially submerged data centers that rely on large bodies of already cool water to disperse heat.\n Google\u2019s Demasi said that the company cooled its data centers using seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium and recycled wastewater in the United States, at its site in Douglas County, Georgia.\n  Switching over to new technologies can be extremely costly, and data center operators are more likely to wait until the end of the lifecycle of the existing equipment than retrofit cooling systems, said Todd Boucher, founder of the data center design firm Leading Edge Design Group.\n   In Mesa, Duff is thinking about the legacy of the decisions her city, and others, are making about water now. \u201cI am 61 years old, and I know that in whatever lifetime I have left I will not see the total impact of what we are doing today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our children and their children will, and we have to take responsibility for that.\u201d\u201cI hope the next generation does not look back at ours and say, \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we saw the warnings and started taking aggressive measures in order to preserve our planet and our lives.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:59:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51ccc39be54934eba67eff9d55cfe0b6.png", "infoid": 1066936, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Phabricator\u662f\u4e00\u7ec4\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 \u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u6258\u7ba1\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002  GitHub\u662f\u8d85\u8fc76500\u4e07\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7ef4\u57fa\u514b\u9686\u5982\u6b64\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002  \u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9\u5b83\u6bcf\u5929\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u95f2\u901b\u3002  \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002 \u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0cDEVOPS\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5236\u4f5c\u3002  Microsoft\u56e2\u961f\u662fMicrosoft 365\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u96c6\u7ebf\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002  Gitter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u957f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u793e\u533a\u3002 \nTutanota\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u79c1\u5bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002  \u5c06\u516c\u5171Web\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002  Outlook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u60a8\u7ba1\u7406\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e5\u5386\uff0c\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002  LucidChart\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u4eceJira\uff0cBitbucket\uff0cSonarqube\u6536\u96c6\u654f\u6377\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u5f39\u6027\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5728Kibana\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316  CLI\u5de5\u5177\u4eceJIRA\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff06amp;

Consequently, it has become important to pay attentionto these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We presentand motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thoroughsurvey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modelingtechniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We alsopresent an experiment-based guide along with code, for practitioners tooptimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the firstcomprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers thelandscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. Ourhope is that this survey would provide the reader with the mental model and thenecessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques toimmediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas forfurther research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:52:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "It took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since the early 2010\u2019s, it has been booming \u2014 and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java and JavaScript in popularity.\n But until when will that trend continue? When will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?\n Putting an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting Python\u2019s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.\n   Python\u2019s success is reflected in the  Stack Overflow trends, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform. Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.\n  While R has been plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline, Python\u2019s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are tagged \u201cpython\u201d, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for that.\n  Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn\u2019t only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large and supportive community.\n So if you have any issue while you\u2019re coding in Python, the odds are high that you\u2019ll be able to solve it with a single Google search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and written something helpful about it.\n  It\u2019s not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very human-readable.\n For starters, there\u2019s no need to specify the data type. You just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it\u2019s an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for beginners. If you\u2019ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is your program won\u2019t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.\n And if you\u2019ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you\u2019ll know how understandable Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it\u2019s a rather bumpy read compared to Python code.\n  Since Python has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose. These days, you can find a package for almost everything.\n Want to crunch numbers, vectors and matrices? NumPy is your guy. Want to do calculations for tech and engineering? Use SciPy. Want to go big in data manipulation and analysis? Give Pandas a go. Want to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use Scikit-Learn.\n Whichever computational task you\u2019re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments, can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.\n  Based on the previous elaborations, you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.\n  Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you\u2019ll need about 2\u201310 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language.\n There are  various reasons for that. One of them is that it\u2019s dynamically typed \u2014 remember that you don\u2019t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time.\n Another reason is that Python can only execute one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes \u2014 Python needs to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could mess that up.\n In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.\n But at the end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten so cheap that we\u2019re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn\u2019t really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.\n  Originally, Python was dynamically scoped. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.\n The problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every possible context \u2014 which is tedious. That\u2019s why most modern programming languages use static scoping.\n Python tried to transition to static scoping, but messed it up. Usually, inner scopes \u2014 for example functions within functions \u2014 would be able to see and change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.\n  Despite all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive. Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.\n On the other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means that Lambdas cannot be used for them.\n This distinction between expressions and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn\u2019t occur in other languages.\n   In Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code. This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.\n Other languages, for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.\n Newer languages like Haskell solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax for those who wish to go without.\n  As we\u2019re witnessing the shift from desktop to smartphone, it\u2019s clear that we need robust languages to build mobile software.\n But not many mobile apps are being developed with Python. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be done \u2014 there is a Python package called Kivy for this purpose.\n But Python wasn\u2019t made with mobile in mind. So even though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.\n To be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come. But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it\u2019s safe to say that learning Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.\n  A Python script isn\u2019t compiled first and then executed. Instead, it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a lot of tests. Like, a lot of tests.\n This is great for beginners since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.\n   Rust offers the same kind of safety that Python has \u2014 no variable can accidentally be overwritten. But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing. It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according to  StackOverflow Insights.\n Go is great for beginners like Python. And it is so simple that it\u2019s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go developers are among the  highest-paid programmers on the market.\n Julia is a very new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now, one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.\n While there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies, most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small, as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is clear: upwards.\n  Given the ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade, maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.\n Which of the languages it will be \u2014 Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future \u2014 is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.\n This article was written by \u00a0 Rhea Moutafis\u00a0and was originally published on \u00a0 Towards Data Science.

\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "In 1993, a media studies professor at Fordham University named Edward Wachtel visited several  famous caves in southern France, including Lascaux, Font-de-Gaume, Les Combarelles, and La Mouthe. His purpose: to study the cave art that has justly made these caves famous. \u00a0Wachtel was puzzled by what he called &#34;spaghetti lines&#34; on the drawings, partially obscuring them. There were also images of, say, an ibex with two heads, a mammal with three trunks, or a bull drawing superimposed over the drawing of a deer.\n His guide for the La Mouthe tour was a local farmer, and since there were no electric lights in this cave, the farmer brought along a gas lantern. When the farmer swung the lantern inside the cave, the color schemes shifted, and the engraved lines seemed to animate. &#34;Suddenly, the head of one creature stood out clearly,&#34; Wachtel recalled. &#34;It lived for a second, then faded as another appeared.&#34;\u00a0As for those mysterious spaghetti lines, &#34;they became a forest or a bramble patch that concealed and then reveled the animals within.&#34;\n Wachtel subsequently published a paper entitled, &#34; The First Picture Show: Cinematic Aspects of Cave Art,&#34; in which  he concluded that the cave drawings were meant to be perceived in three dimensions\u2014one of them being time. These could have been the first &#34;protomovies,&#34; he thought.\n It&#39;s an intriguing take, although it must be said that Wachtel&#39;s ideas are speculative. There is no way to definitively prove what those prehistoric cave artists intended, and therefore it&#39;s unwise to draw strong inferences about these being cinematic in nature, or to assume that this tells us anything about prehistoric artists&#39; conception of time. But his point about the importance of viewing cave paintings under the lighting conditions in which they were created and viewed in prehistoric times is sound.\n  Wachtel&#39;s story recently resurfaced in  a Twitter thread, and it couldn&#39;t be more timely. Lighting sources could indeed hold vital clues to the different ways prehistoric peoples used caves, according to\u00a0 a new paper\u00a0by a team of Spanish scientists, published in the journal PLOS ONE. They conducted  in situ experiments with three different kinds of Paleolithic lighting sources, in the hopes of shedding some light (pun intended) on what those various illumination methods might tell us about the emergence of &#34;human symbolic and artistic behavior&#34; in the form of cave art.\n There are nearly 350 such prehistoric caves in France and Spain alone, including the oldest cave painting yet known: a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Caceres, Spain, likely drawn by a Neanderthal some 64,000 years ago. (The oldest known depiction of an animal was discovered in 2018 on the island of Borneo in Indonesia, dating back 40,000 years.)\u00a0The Spanish team chose to conduct their experiments at the Isuntza 1 Cave in Spain&#39;s Basque country, and selected two distinct spaces in particular.\n    The first was a large, wide chamber with walls of bedrock, with 99.7 percent relative humidity and an average temperature of 17.6 degrees C (63.6 degrees F). \u00a0They thought it would be ideal as a &#34;staying chamber&#34; for the experiments The second space was a second, slightly smaller chamber with similar relative humidity (99.9 percent) and average temperatures (14.2 degrees C, or 57.5 degrees F) similar to the first space.\u00a0The two spaces are connected by a rough passage 40 meters long (about 131 feet).\n  The Spanish researchers chose lighting types for their eight experiments based on known archaeological data: five torches tested in both spaces and the passage, as well as two stone lamps with animal fat, and a small fireplace, both tested just in the first space. All the torches were made from dry juniper branches joined together, like the remains of ancient torches found in the Aldene and Reseau Clastres caves. The researchers included a bit of birch to act as tinder, and added pine resin, animal fat, or a combination thereof to assess how well different fuel types worked.\n The lamps were replicas of a sandstone lamp found in La Mouthe Cave in Dordogne, France. They used bovine animal fat as fuel, with three juniper wicks, arranged in a teepee shape inside the lamp. They also built a small fireplace on a clay substrate in the first chamber with juniper and oak as wood fuel.\n For all the lighting experiments, the team measured how long the lighting source lasted (duration); the total amount of light reaching a specific surface or point relative to the human eye (illuminance, or lux); how much illumination was emitted in certain directions (luminous intensity); the minimum distance between the light source and total darkness (action radius); and luminance, which connects light intensity with the surface of the source. They also kept track of the highest temperature reached by each type of lighting source.\n    Those measurements showed that the various lighting sources had very different characteristics, and thus were probably used in different contexts. The wooden torches, for instance, emitted light in all directions, up to nearly six meters (19.6 feet), and lasted an average of 41 minutes. The torches exhibited uneven light intensity, and often needed to be relit by waving them from side to side, and they produced a lot smoke. So they worked best for exploring caves or crossing wide spaces. The team also found that adding resin intensified the flame, while adding animal fat extended its duration.\n    In contrast, the grease lamps emitted weaker light akin to the intensity of a candle, over a span of three meters (9.8 feet) or so. They burned consistently, and didn&#39;t smoke, for over an hour, but they had a dazzling effect if the person was moving and didn&#39;t illuminate the floor very well. Also, &#34;It was necessary to maintain constant control over the wick to prevent it from sinking into the fatty fuel, causing the flame to be extinguished,&#34; the authors wrote. This makes the lamps better suited for lighting small cave spaces over a longer period, complementing the advantages of the torches.\n As for the fireplace\u2014the only truly static system\u2014its illumination covered a range of 6.6 meters (21.6 feet). However, it burned for just 30 minutes and gave off a lot of white smoke, making it unsuitable for use unless there were strong enough air currents to disperse that smoke. &#34;The fireplace location was not appropriately placed regarding air currents,&#34; the authors noted, which are &#34;essential to achieving a prolonged stay underground. However, in the case of large fires, convection currents are produced, and they would be efficient enough to evacuate gases outside of the cave.&#34;\n The Spanish team also built a virtual 3D model of a section of the Atxurra cave known as the Ledge of the Horses. It&#39;s a naturally formed platform just above a passage floor, with two panels of about 50 animal engravings: bison, goats, horses, and hinds, many of them overlapping. The ledge was also littered with scattered charcoal, lithic tools, and ashes from three probable fireplaces. In the virtual model, they conducted a spatial analysis of all three tested lighting sources.\n    The modeling showed that the decorated panels would be &#34;barely perceptible&#34; to someone standing in the lower parts of the gallery, even if that person were carrying a lamp or a torch. It would need to be illuminated from the top of the ledge to be seen. In contrast, the fireplaces appeared to be strategically located to illuminate the entire decorated space. Torches did prove to be a good lighting source for accessing that space, however, with an estimated travel time of 38.39 minutes\u2014in line with the measured duration of the torches. &#34;It does not seem by chance that the optimal routes estimated to access this space are covered with scattered charcoals, surely fallen from the torches used in the Magdalenian period,&#34; the authors wrote.\n The findings have no direct bearing on Wachtel&#39;s speculation about prehistoric cinematic art. But the more archaeologists learn about Paleolithic lighting sources, the more we will understand about how those lighting sources affect human perception in a cave environment, with implications for the emergence of cave art. That&#39;s why the Spanish team thinks it is essential to continue conducting these kinds of experiments.\n &#34;Only with a large corpus of archaeological remains, including different types of lighting systems (and fuels), studied through an interdisciplinary approach, will it be possible to adequately reproduce Paleolithic light resources,&#34; they concluded in their paper, &#34;Our experiments in Paleolithic lighting point to planning in the human use of caves in this period, and the importance of lighting studies to travel the activities carried out by our ancestors in the deep areas of caves. &#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:15:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6d1e\u7a74,recreated", "title":

diversify the world of venture capital,  launched a million-dollar fund. Founder Hadiyah Mujhid told me that the capital would provide nondilutive financing to overlooked founders, which they define as Black, Indigenous and LatinX entrepreneurs, replacing the traditional angel round. But she also admitted that supporting founders wasn\u2019t the only primary goal. Instead, she explained to me the importance of what she defines as \u201cteaching capital.\u201d\n Similar to how teaching hospitals give aspiring doctors a way to practice and learn their craft before formally entering the field, the fund wants to do that for their some 230 aspiring investors that they already work with, many stemming from historically Black colleges and universities. Notably, nondilutive capital provides entrepreneurs with funding sans equity and a learning experience with lower stakes.\n There are a lot of organizations right now that are starting funds [with] the primary goal of supporting founders. And that\u2019s a goal of ours, but we\u2019re hoping to have a ripple effect of training and really providing on-ramps for the next best-in-class investors \u2026 and in order to do that, they have to have a training vehicle.\n While I\u2019m not always a fan of rebranded names for capital, \u201cteaching capital\u201d is certainly a compelling framing. Track record is everything in this industry, and underrepresented folks often don\u2019t have the benefit or privilege of access on their side \u2014 from a dollar or deals perspective. Scout programs have long existed to fill this gap, but I think that there is still a lacking of intentionality around who feels empowered to write an investment memo, ask questions and be new. This week, BLCK VC  launched its scout program and Google for Startups launched a nondilutive financing instrument for Black founders, underscoring a growing focus in seeding diverse entrepreneurs.\n HBCUvc\u2019s fund was announced nearly one year after it almost shut down due to a lack of capital. Mujhid explained how the unjust killing of George Floyd led to the biggest one-day donation in her nonprofit\u2019s lifetime, which \u201cchanged the trajectory of programming.\u201d She also said that a lot of interest was a knee-jerk reaction, urging people to view this work as a long-term commitment.\n   In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll get into Waymo\u2019s latest raise, the Nubank EC-1 and a Pittsburgh event that I can\u2019t wait to nerd out about.\n    Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving arm,  raised $2.5 billion in its second-ever institutional round. Investors include Alphabet, Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Temasek and, of course, Tiger Global.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Waymo is going external after some internal shuffling. The funding comes only months after CEO John Krafcik stepped down from his title after spending five years in that position. Last month,  Waymo lost its CFO and head of partnerships.\n      Another week, another EC-1! Marcella McCarthy wrote about Nubank, a Brazillian credit card and banking fintech company that just last week raised at a $30 billion valuation. It\u2019s one of the most valuable startups in the world, with over 40 million users.\n Here\u2019s what to know: As McCarthy puts it in the piece, Nubank  started by trying to solve a massive challenge: \u201cHow to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.\u201d Maybe, the story goes on to tell, it would start with California Street.\n  Co-founder dynamics \u201c One woman\u2019s drive to make a neobank as magical as Disney\u201d (1,900 words/8 minutes)\n Launching and scaling \u201c How Nubank\u2019s CX strategy made it one of the most loved digital banks\u201d (2,700 words/11 minutes)\n Market expansion and future \u201c Which Nubank will own the financial revolution?\u201d (2,250 words/9 minutes)\n   In May, thousands of you  read my Duolingo EC-1, a deep dive into Pittsburgh\u2019s favorite edtech unicorn. Now, we\u2019re taking you to Pittsburgh to hear from Karin Tsai,  the head of engineering there, as well as Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian, Mayor Bill Peduto and a smattering of local startups.\n Our  TC City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event will be held on June 29,  so make sure to register here (for free) to listen to these conversations, enjoy the pitch-off and network with local talent.\n Also, a friendly reminder that we\u2019re making a list of  the best growth marketers for startups.

He will continue to also hold the CEO position. This makes it the first time since 2000, when co-founder Bill Gates stepped down as CEO, that the same person is holding both positions, demonstrating the company\u2019s confidence in Nadella\u2019s ability to take it into the future.\n  In February 2014, when Nadella was appointed CEO, Microsoft\u2019s flagship Windows business was weakening, and the company was struggling with its failures in the mobile phone and internet search markets. Nadella, who grew up in Hyderabad and joined Microsoft in the US in 1992, refocused the company around cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and instilled a greater sense of ownership among employees \u2014 moves that paid off handsomely. The company\u2019s share price has risen nearly 600% since 2014. And since the fourth quarter of 2018, Microsoft has frequently been the most valued publicly listed company in the world, with Apple the only other contender for that spot.\n On Nadella\u2019s appointment as chairman, Microsoft said in a statement, \u201cIn this role, Nadella will lead the work to set the agenda for the board leveraging his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify key risks and mitigation approaches for the board\u2019s review.\u201d\n Nadella, 53, succeeds John Thompson, a former CEO of Symantec who took over as chairman when Gates stepped down from that post in 2014.\n In December, in a filing to the US stock market regulator SEC, the board heaped praise on Nadella for the way he navigated the company through the pandemic, and the manner in which he had transformed the company\u2019s culture. \u201cDuring fiscal year 2020, Microsoft increased revenue by 14% year over year, while facing unprecedented constraints due to Covid-19 in the second half of the year. Under Mr Nadella\u2019s leadership during 2020, many of Microsoft\u2019s products achieved significant growth\u2026,\u201d it said.\n The board, the filing said, had asked Nadella to create additional focus on the culture of the organisation for fiscal year 2020 and is very pleased with the results that were achieved. \u201cBased on poll data, 95% of employees feel proud to work at Microsoft. The board credits Mr Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organisation,\u201d it said.\n Nadella was born in Hyderabad. His mother was a Sanskrit lecturer and his father an IAS officer. He attended the Hyderabad Public School, and went on to do a Bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka. He then went to the US to do a Master\u2019s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n            Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:49:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5fae\u8f6f,microsoft,ceo", "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u4e3b\u5e2d ", "title_en": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Now Also Elevated to Microsoft's Chairman", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/satya-nadella-elevated-as-microsoft-chairman/ar-AALa3HE", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5fae\u8f6f", "microsoft", "ceo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7ba9870e9562b164b17858b3a511c10c.jpeg", "infoid": 1066929, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5468\u56db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u94c1\u9508\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5199\u4f5c\u90e8\u5206\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\uff0339;\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8Linux\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u52aa\u529b\u6765\u589e\u52a0Linux\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\n       \u5982\u679c\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

Such a change would mark a major technological and cultural shift for an open-source software project that&#39;s become foundational to Google&#39;s Android and Chrome operating systems as well as vast swaths of the internet.\n Miguel Ojeda, who&#39;s written software used by the  Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator and worked on programming language security, is being contracted to write software in  Rust for the Linux kernel. Google is paying for the contract, which is being extended through the  Internet Security Research Group, a nonprofit that&#39;s also made it easier to  secure website communications through the  Let&#39;s Encrypt effort.\n       Adding Rust modules to the Linux kernel would improve security by closing some avenues for hackers can use to attack phones, computers or servers. Since it was launched in 1991, Linux has been written solely in the powerful but old  C programming language. The language was developed in 1972 and is more vulnerable to hacks than contemporary programming languages.\n    Better security for Linux is good news for everyone but hackers. In addition to the Android and Chrome OSes, Google services like YouTube and Gmail all rely on servers running Linux. It also powers Amazon and Facebook, and is a fixture in  cloud computing services.\n It isn&#39;t clear if Linux kernel leaders will accommodate Rust. Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux, has said he&#39;s  open to change if  Rust for Linux champions prove its worth. Ojeda has proposed 13  changes needed to allow Rust modules in Linux to get things started.\n Google already has taken some early steps to make it possible to  use Rust for Linux Android. Getting buy-in at the highest levels of the Linux kernel project means many other software projects could benefit, too.\n Google credits the Linux community programmers who began the Rust for Linux project. &#34;The community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system,&#34; Google said in a blog post.\n  Rust, which was developed by Firefox maker  Mozilla and is now run by the independent  Rust Foundation, makes it safer for software to write to memory.  Hackers can exploit memory problems, hiding malicious extra code in out-of-bounds memory areas. Rust checks for those and other problems when programmers are building their software. And it&#39;s been the  most loved programming language for five years running in Stack Overflow&#39;s annual developer survey.\n &#34;Rust represents the  best alternative to C and C++ currently available,&#34; Microsoft&#39;s security team concluded in 2019. The team said Rust would have prevented memory problems at fault in 70% of its significant security issues. And because Rust&#39;s checks happen while software is being built, the safety doesn&#39;t come at the expense of performance when the software is running.\n The goal of the Linux on Rust project isn&#39;t to replace all of Linux&#39;s C code but rather to improve selective and new parts.\n &#34;For the foreseeable future we plan to focus on certain security critical components and drivers,&#34; said Josh Aas, who runs ISRG&#39;s Prossimo project to move critical Internet software to memory safe software. Drivers are operating systems modules that control specific devices like printers, network adapters and graphics chips.\n Google isn&#39;t placing its only bets on Linux and Rust.

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard&#39;s podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\n  Last week  Motherboard revealed that hackers stole a wealth of data from game publishing giant Electronic Arts, including source code for the Frostbite engine and  FIFA 21 game. The hackers said they did this, in part, by purchasing a cookie for $10 that let them  log into an EA Slack account, and then tricking EA&#39;s IT support into granting access to the company&#39;s internal network.\n  Now, a representative for the hackers has told Motherboard where they allegedly bought that cookie: Genesis Market, an invite-only underground site where cybercriminals can source cookies that have been lifted from hacked computers for a cornucopia of services.\n    &#34;Can filter for sale by URL,&#34; the representative of the EA hackers said in an online chat, specifying that criminals can search for domains such as Slack or Okta, a popular cybersecurity and sign-in service designed to make access to company assets more secure.\n   Have you used data from Genesis Market in a hack? Do you know anything else about the site? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on\u00a0  jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email\u00a0joseph.cox@vice.com.\n  A  handful of  cybersecurity companies  and trade publications have covered the site in the past few years. But its alleged link to a high profile breach demonstrates its increasing relevance in the digital underground.\n  Cookies are small files stored on your computer that can hold all sorts of information. Sometimes they can be used by advertising firms to track browsing activity from site to site; other times they&#39;re used for storing login details and keeping you logged into different websites. On Genesis, criminals don&#39;t just buy one cookie; they buy exclusive access to a &#34;bot,&#34; a compromised computer that is part of a botnet which could contain any number of login details. But more importantly, Genesis also lets customers essentially recreate a one-to-one replica of that victim&#39;s browser, with their cookies and device fingerprints intact.\n    &#34;Someone is essentially getting a perfect mask of you,&#34; Matthew Gracey-McMinn, head of threat research at cybersecurity firm Netacea which has investigated Genesis, told Motherboard. In some cases, using data bought from Genesis could let a hacker bypass two-factor authentication, because the logged in service may not prompt a user who appears legitimate for the extra code from their phone, for example. In the website&#39;s eyes, whoever is logging in is using an already known device.\n  This sort of data makes a hacker and the victim &#34;pretty much indistinguishable,&#34; Gracey-McMinn added.\n   Whereas bots are often used for re-routing a hacker&#39;s traffic to make it harder for law enforcement to identify their location, or carry out distributed denial of service attacks, Genesis has presented an opportunity to diversify a botnet owner&#39;s income stream, Gracey-McMinn said.\n  &#34;We&#39;re on these computers, we can see everything happening on them. Why don&#39;t we exfiltrate that data as it comes in\u2014login credentials, browser fingerprints, the whole works,&#34; Gracey-McMinn said.\n  When selecting a bot to purchase, Genesis shows a user what particular sites are included, according to screenshots and videos shared by Gracey-McMinn and Dan Woods from cybersecurity firm F5 which has also tracked Genesis. One bot for sale had 5,000 cookies linked to it across multiple web browsers, and included sites as diverse as Facebook, Spotify, Reddit, Pinterest, Apple, Netflix, Binance, GitHub, Steam, Instagram, Adobe, Amazon, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, Dropbox, PayPal, LinkedIn, NvidiaStore, EANetwork, and Slack.\n    Both Gracey-McMinn and Woods said that a search for bots across the marketplace mentioning Slack returned over 3,500 results. The number of listings overall has grown substantially, with nearly 400,000 listings available, both researchers showed Motherboard.\n  The site itself provides a slick, self-service interface for users. Woods showed Motherboard customer support communications he had with the site administrators while using the marketplace. The responses were in perfect English.\n   After buying a bot, hackers can simply take the exposed login details included in cookies such as email addresses and passwords and access the relevant sites. Or, they can use a browser plugin that Genesis offers which lets the hackers use the exposed information to mimic the victim on a much more convincing level. Here, Genesis will create a configuration file\u2014the mask that Gracey-McMinn mentioned\u2014that the hackers then import into their own browser. The first file is free, but customers need to pay to generate new configuration files based on the cookies and browser information after that, screenshots showed.\n  And new data may keep flowing in. The customer doesn&#39;t necessarily just buy a bot, use the credentials, and move on. If whatever malware which is collecting the information is still active on the victim&#39;s machine, Genesis will update itself with that new data, and notify the user when it arrives.\n    &#34;If I&#39;ve bought early, I&#39;ve essentially got a great bargain. I could get something that would eventually be worth hundreds of dollars for 70 cents,&#34; Gracey-McMinn said.\n  Gracey-McMinn said they think Genesis is a single seller marketplace, with only one group of people selling information gleaned from malware. Woods believes that the creators of Genesis originally populated the marketplace with items collected with their own malware, and then allowed others to sell products too. One reason is that out of the hundreds of thousands of bots on the market, some of the bot names, a series of alphanumeric characters, have a constant substring in them.\n    Both researchers said they believe information from Genesis is being used in real-world attacks. Specifically Woods said F5 has reverse-engineered the Genesis plugin so it can observe when attackers use it against their customers.

And all this before we\u2019ve even reached the hottest part of the summer.\n  Among the 40 million Americans enduring the triple-digit temperatures are scientists who study droughts and the climate. They\u2019d long forewarned of this crisis, and now they\u2019re living through it. The Guardian spoke with researchers across the west about how they\u2019re coping.\n    I feel a little bit lucky because I\u2019m in Orange county, relatively close to the coast \u2013 so the temperatures are not as severe here as they are in other parts of California and the west. I\u2019m worried about this summer \u2013 this doesn\u2019t bode well, in terms of what we can expect with wildfire and the worsening drought. This current drought is potentially on track to become the worst that we\u2019ve seen in at least 1,200 years. And the reason is linked directly to human caused climate change.\n As a paleoclimatologist my main point, always, is that we are able to look into the past. By looking at tree rings and other paleoclimate records, we\u2019re able to gain really important perspectives about how climate has varied and changed in the past. And having done that, it\u2019s clear that what we\u2019re experiencing now is not natural. This is undoubtedly being caused by human activities, by greenhouse gas emissions.\n The more we see these extreme events, piled on top of each other, and not just in the western US but globally, the more I think the reality of climate change becomes inescapable. And it feels absolutely overwhelming and sad. We are going to have less water, increased wildfires and more extreme heatwaves. But it\u2019s also motivating. We need to continue to push for urgent action on climate change\n    This is really, really bad. Here on the eastern side of the Rockies, here in Boulder, we\u2019re seeing record high temperatures. That\u2019s the case in other parts of the state and in other states. And we\u2019re seeing smoke plumes \u2013 not from local fires but from fires in Arizona and Utah. I think for a lot of people, it\u2019s traumatic. The fires we saw in the last couple of years were really awful, and this year it seems like we\u2019re on that same trajectory. It kind of feels like deja vu.\n It does get rough sometime \u2013 talking about these things year after year. I live in the west, and all my family, pretty much, lives in the west. Most of my friends live in the west. It\u2019s where I grew up, and seeing the landscape-scale transformations that are happening here, and seeing how it\u2019s affecting people is overwhelming sometimes. But actually to me, the most distressing part is that this is very much in line with predictions. Climate scientists have been repeating essentially the same messages and warnings since before I was born.\n Climate change is a major contributor to, if not the dominant factor, in a lot of the changes that we\u2019re seeing out west and elsewhere. And it just is going to keep getting worse unless we do something about it. And so far, you know, we have yet to do the kinds of things, on a large enough scale, that are actually going to make a meaningful difference.\n The atmospheric scientist: \u2018It\u2019s surreal to see your models become real life\u2019\n   The extreme heat and the wildfires aren\u2019t surprising. But it is just surreal to see what you only ever saw before in your research studies and models, actually happening in real life. And you\u2019re almost dumbfounded by the speed at which your projections have become reality.\n Climate change is loading the weather dice against us. We always have a chance of rolling a double six naturally, and getting an intense record breaking summer heatwave. But decade by decade as the world warms, it\u2019s as if climate change is sneaking in and taking one of those numbers on the dice and turning it into another six, and then another six. And maybe even a seven. So we are seeing that heatwaves are coming earlier in the year, they are longer, they are stronger.\n Still, public opinion data shows that there\u2019s a disconnect, where even though about 72% of people in the US say global warming is happening, only 40% say that they think that it will affect them directly. But we actually did a  recent study, looking at climate and weather extremes \u2013 and we found that really hot, dry conditions are the only thing that most people in the US directly connect to climate change. So right now is a really important time for scientists to communicate with the public that climate change is here, and climate action matters.\n    Yesterday, when Salt Lake City hit record temperatures, we went to one of our grad students\u2019 back yards to barbecue some burgers and do some work. But it was so hot \u2013 oh my gosh, 107F (42C). So hot that, actually three out of five students\u2019 computers overheated and broke. I was the first to throw in the white flag and ask to go home \u2013 I really hurting.\n As a meteorologist, of course this isn\u2019t a surprise. The warming climate is making these dry, hot periods even drier and hotter. Since we\u2019re in a drought, we don\u2019t really have much moisture in the soil. And without that moisture, the sun really heats up the ground and the air much faster. So, really what we\u2019re seeing in the south-west is, the ground is burning like a hotplate. And we\u2019re standing on it.\n But you know, I actually feel kind of optimistic. In the restaurants and beer houses right now, everybody is talking about the weather, and how hot it is. And a few of them will even comment, \u201cThis is the new normal.\u201d And I mean \u2013 we\u2019re in Utah! Whatever people believe in, they know it\u2019s really hot, and the climate is changing \u2013 and they don\u2019t like that. These compounding extreme weather events are really bad \u2013 but they\u2019re going to keep happening, no matter what. Maybe if there\u2019s some good to come out of it, it\u2019s that people are becoming more aware. And the sooner the general public starts to become aware of this issue, the sooner, hopefully, they\u2019ll push for changes to address the crisis. So actually, if you saw me walking around outside this week, I probably had a smile on my face as I listened to some of these conversations.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:47:56", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Twenty miles south of Cairo, on the Nile&#39;s west bank, where riverfed crop fields give way to desert, the ancient site of Saqqara is marked by crumbling pyramids that emerge from the sand like dragon&#39;s teeth. Most striking is the famous Step Pyramid, built in the 27th century B.C. by Djoser, the Old Kingdom pharaoh who launched the tradition of constructing pyramids as monumental royal tombs. More than a dozen other pyramids are scattered along the five-mile strip of land, which is also dotted with the remains of temples, tombs and walkways that, together, span the entire history of ancient Egypt. But beneath the ground is far more\u2014a vast and extraordinary netherworld of treasures.\n        One scorching day last fall, Mohammad Youssef, an archaeologist, clung to a rope inside a shaft that had been closed for more than 2,000 years. At the bottom, he shined his flashlight through a gap in the limestone wall and was greeted by a god\u2019s gleaming eyes: a small, painted statue of the composite funerary deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, with a golden face and plumed crown. It was Youssef\u2019s first glimpse of a large chamber that was guarded by a heap of figurines, carved wooden chests and piles of blackened linen. Inside, Youssef and his colleagues found signs that the people buried here had wealth and privilege: gilded masks, a finely carved falcon and a painted scarab beetle rolling the sun across the sky. Yet this was no luxurious family tomb, as might have been expected. Instead, the archaeologists were astonished to discover dozens of expensive coffins jammed together, piled to the ceiling as if in a warehouse. Beautifully painted, human-shaped boxes were stacked roughly on top of heavy limestone sarcophagi. Gilded coffins were packed into niches around the walls. The floor itself was covered in rags and bones.\n  This eerie chamber is one of several \u201cmegatombs,\u201d as the archaeologists describe them, discovered last year at Saqqara, the sprawling necropolis that once served the nearby Egyptian capital of Memphis. The excavators overseen by Youssef uncovered hundreds of coffins, mummies and grave goods, including carved statues and mummified cats, packed into several shafts, all untouched since antiquity. The trove includes many individual works of art, from the gilded portrait mask of a sixth- or seventh-century B.C. noblewoman to a bronze figure of the god Nefertem inlaid with precious gems. The scale of discoveries\u2014captured in the  Smithsonian Channel documentary series  \u201cTomb Hunters,\u201d an advance copy of which was made available to me\u2014has excited archaeologists. They say it opens a window into a period late in ancient Egyptian history when Saqqara was at the center of a national revival in pharaonic culture and attracted visitors from across the known world. The site is full of contradictions, entwining past and future, spirituality and economics. It was a hive of ritual and magic that arguably couldn\u2019t seem more distant from our modern world. Yet it nurtured ideas so powerful they still shape our lives today.\n    Travelers visiting Egypt have long marveled at the vestiges of the pharaohs\u2019 lost world\u2014the great pyramids, ancient temples and mysterious writings carved into stone. But Egyptology, the formal study of ancient Egyptian civilization, didn\u2019t begin in earnest until Napoleon Bonaparte invaded at the turn of the 19th century and French scholars collected detailed records of ancient sites and scoured the country for antiquities. When Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion deciphered hieroglyphs, in the 1820s, the history of one of humanity\u2019s great civilizations could finally be read, and European scholars and enthusiasts flocked to see not only the pyramids at Giza but also the colossal Ramses II statues carved into the cliffs at Abu Simbel and the royal tombs in Luxor\u2019s Valley of the Kings.\n    Apart from its eroding pyramids, Saqqara was known, by contrast, for its subterranean caverns, which locals raided for mummies to use as fertilizer and tourists ransacked for souvenirs. Looters carted off not only mummified people but also mummified animals\u2014hawks, ibises, baboons. Saqqara didn\u2019t attract much archaeological attention until the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who became the first director of Egypt\u2019s Antiquities Service, visited in 1850. He declared the site \u201ca spectacle of utter devastation,\u201d with yawning pits and dismantled brick walls where the sand was mixed with mummy wrappings and bones. But he also noticed the half-buried statue of a sphinx, and probing further he found a sphinx-lined avenue leading to a temple called the Serapeum. Beneath the temple were tunnels that held the coffins of Apis bulls, worshiped as incarnations of Ptah and Osiris.\n  Since then, excavations have revealed a history of burials and cult ceremonies spanning more than 3,000 years, from Egypt\u2019s earliest pharaohs to its dying breaths in the Roman era. Yet Saqqara has remained overshadowed by the glamour of Luxor to the south, where in the second millennium B.C. pharaohs covered the walls of their tombs with depictions of the afterlife, and the Great Pyramids just miles to the north.\n    It certainly took a while for Mostafa Waziri, the archaeologist directing the latest project, to be converted to Saqqara\u2019s charms. He spent most of his career excavating in Luxor, but in 2017 he was appointed director of  Egypt\u2019s Supreme Council of Antiquities (making him, among other things, a successor to Mariette). The new job entailed a move to Cairo. Continuing to dig in southern Egypt was therefore no longer practical, he says, but on his doorstep was another great opportunity: \u201cI realized it was less than one hour from my office to Saqqara!\u201d\n  Working with an Egyptian team, including Youssef, the site director, Waziri chose to excavate near a mysterious temple called the Bubasteion, dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet, that had been cut into limestone cliffs near the site\u2019s eastern boundary around 600 B.C. A group of French archaeologists had worked nearby for decades, where they found, among other discoveries, the 14th-century B.C. tomb of King Tutankhamen\u2019s wet nurse, Maia. But Waziri targeted an area that the French team had used to pile the debris from their excavations, calculating that whatever lay beneath it had remained untouched.\n    His approach paid off. In December 2018, Waziri announced the discovery of a 4,400-year-old tomb, intact and ornately carved, that belonged to a high-ranking priest named Wahtye. The next season yielded intriguing caches of animal mummies\u2014not just cats but a cobra, a lion cub, a mongoose and even a scarab beetle. Then, in September 2020, the team unearthed a vertical shaft dug 30 feet down into the bedrock, the first of the \u201cmegatombs.\u201d In separate niches at the bottom were two giant coffins, and when the archaeologists cleared the surrounding debris they found dozens more. \u201cI had to call the [antiquities] minister,\u201d says Waziri. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How many?\u2019\u201d Eighteen months later, Waziri is still counting.\n    In a simple conservation lab set up at the site, Youssef and his colleagues admired the first coffin to be removed from the shaft. Sealed with black resin, it was roughly human-shaped but huge and squat\u2014more than 7.5 feet long and 3 feet wide\u2014with a wide, impassive face. Removing the intricately carved wooden lid revealed a glint of gold: A second coffin was nested inside, complete with gilded mask. Beautifully preserved, it showed the face of a woman with large, kohl-lined eyes. The rest of the inner coffin was intricately painted in blue, green and red, and included flower and leaf motifs and a depiction of the sky goddess, Nut, with outstretched wings. Most exciting, though, were the hieroglyphs, because they provided valuable information about the occupant: not just spells to aid her journey to the afterlife but details of her family, as well as her name: Ta-Gemi-En-Aset.\n    These details and the distinctive style of the coffin indicate that she lived during the sixth or seventh century B.C., at the start of Egypt\u2019s Late Period, when a pharaoh named Psamtik I reunified the country after a period of instability and foreign invasions. Egypt was strong and prosperous once again, a global power alongside Babylon and Persia. Psamtik also revived the powerful city of Memphis, then home to around two million people, and nearby Saqqara to hold its dead. According to Campbell Price, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the Manchester Museum in England, the name Ta-Gemi-En-Aset means \u201cshe who was found by Isis.\u201d The coffin inscriptions describe her mother as a singer, and include a symbol representing a sistrum, a musical rattle used in temples. Price suggests that Ta-Gemi may have belonged to the cult of Isis, and perhaps played a role in rituals and festivals in a nearby temple devoted to the goddess.\n  The second coffin retrieved from the shaft was similar to Ta-Gemi\u2019s, and it also contained an inner coffin with a gilded mask. This time, the portrait mask showed a bearded man named Psamtik (probably in honor of one of several pharaohs of this period who shared the name). At first, the team wondered whether Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were related. The hieroglyphs revealed that their fathers had the same name: Horus. But their mothers\u2019 names were different, and further discoveries revealed a different picture.\n    The team dug deeper, a painfully slow process that involved the help of local laborers, who scooped out the sand by hand and hauled basketsful of debris to the surface using a traditional wooden winch called a  tambora, the design of which hasn\u2019t changed in centuries. Below Psamtik\u2019s burial niche was a room filled with many additional coffins, covered in rubble and damaged by ancient rockfalls. The bottom of the shaft led to a second, even bigger cavern, inside of which were jammed more than a hundred coffins of different styles and sizes. There were also loose grave goods, including  ushabtis, miniature figures intended as servants in the afterlife, and hundreds of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statuettes. There were even coffins buried in the base of the shaft itself, as if whoever put them there was running out of space. The result was a megatomb described by the research team as the largest concentration of coffins ever unearthed in Egypt.\n              Great collections of mummies and coffins have been found before, but never grouped so densely together. This was mass burial on an astonishing scale, and it shines a light on Egyptian culture at a moment of transition. In the Old Kingdom, in the third millennium B.C.\u2014Djoser\u2019s time\u2014the elites appear to have favored private family spaces such as the priest Wahtye\u2019s rock-cut tomb, which included an ornate, above-ground chapel for visitors lined with painted reliefs, inscriptions and statues of Wahtye himself. Burial shafts dug into the floor of such tombs were dedicated to particular family members. By the Late Period, some 2,000 years later, well-to-do Egyptians such as Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were packed into tight, shared spaces like cheap crates. Why did people who could clearly afford expensive coffins settle for such a crowded resting place?\n  According to Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, in England, they did so in part because by then the practice was simply routine. Shared tombs became popular across Egypt around 1000 B.C., driven by economic necessity as the kingdom faced a period of instability and collapse. When Psamtik I restored order in the seventh century B.C., the practice stuck. \u201cWe know that from the Late Period, that\u2019s how burials are done,\u201d Dodson says.\n    Campbell Price, of the  Manchester Museum, adds that the answer also has to do with Saqqara\u2019s pyramids. The necropolis had always been a center for religious cults, from the time high-ranking Egyptians were first buried there, often in low, flat-roofed tombs called  mastabas, and probably long before. To help bring the country together after turbulent times, Psamtik encouraged a revival of traditional rituals and belief; after a long period as a backwater, Saqqara exploded again in popularity. Far more than a local cemetery, says Price, it became a pilgrimage site, \u201clike an ancient Mecca or Lourdes,\u201d attracting visitors not just from Egypt but from all over the eastern Mediterranean. Buildings such as the Step Pyramid were already thousands of years old at this time, and people believed their creators, such as Djoser and his architect Imhotep, were gods themselves. Cults and temples sprang up. Pilgrims would bring offerings, and they vied for burial spaces for themselves and their families near the ancient, sacred tombs. \u201cSaqqara would have been the place to be seen dead in,\u201d says Price. \u201cIt had this numinous, divine energy that would help you get into the afterlife.\u201d\n    That created conditions for a thriving commercial operation entwined with the spiritual one, resulting in a kind of real estate market for the dead. \u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d says Dodson. There was probably a sliding scale of options available. Senior officials and military officers were interred in large tombs near the Old Kingdom pyramids of Unas and Userkaf, for example, while the poorest in society were probably buried \u201cin the desert in a sheet.\u201d But the wealthy middle classes appear to have opted for a shared shaft, perhaps with a private niche if they could afford it, or were simply piled with others on the floor. If you wanted to be close to the magical energy of Saqqara\u2019s gods and festivals, Dodson says, \u201cyou bought yourself a space in a shaft.\u201d\n    The supersized burials unearthed by Waziri\u2019s archaeology team reveal how intense the desire for particular locations became\u2014and how profitable they were. Instead of digging new tombs, the priests in charge of burials reused older shafts, expanding them and, Price and Dodson suggest, cramming in as many coffins as they could. The cliffs of the Bubasteion, overlooking the landscape and close to the main processional route, may have been one of the most sought-after spots of all.\n    Last October, the archaeologists found a new shaft beneath the ruins of the Bubasteion\u2014the chaotic, painted chamber illuminated by Youssef\u2019s flashlight. It was another megatomb, bursting with some of the finest coffins and mummies yet discovered, as well as grave goods including a falcon-topped wooden box (possibly a canopic chest, used to store internal organs removed during mummification) and numerous painted Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statues, one of which contained seeds of corn, a symbol of rebirth.\n    Many of the burials date later than the other finds at Saqqara, to the era of Greek rule in Egypt following the Late Period, after Ptolemy, one of Alexander the Great\u2019s top generals, founded a new dynasty of pharaohs in 305 B.C. With the Ptolemaic pharaohs came strong Greek cultural influences, particularly at the Mediterranean capital of Alexandria, home to some of the finest scholars of the Hellenistic world, such as the mathematician Euclid and the physician-anatomist Herophilus. Hundreds of thousands of migrants from across the Greek world settled elsewhere in Egypt, and many were awarded plots of land. Public life was Greek-run, but in private life, including religious worship, there was considerable freedom, and many of the new arrivals appear to have adopted Egyptian beliefs and customs, including mummification. As time went on, says Dodson, \u201cmore people who self-identified as Greeks were being buried according to Egyptian customs.\u201d Saqqara was as busy as ever, and the new discoveries suggest the priests were still squeezing as many bodies as possible into the shafts.\n        In a nearby shaft, the team unearthed cat mummies along with human remains. Previous excavations had discovered a huge cat necropolis at the Bubasteion, where the animals, sacred to the feline goddess Bastet, were embalmed and left as offerings. It was one of many local animal cults. Just north of the Bubasteion is the Anubieion, a temple complex dedicated to the jackal-headed god of death, Anubis, where mazelike tunnels are estimated to have held millions of mummified dogs. Beyond that are catacombs once filled with mummified ibises, hawks and baboons. To the west is the Serapeum, where Apis bulls were laid to rest.\n      These cults always existed at Saqqara. Their roots stretch back to predynastic times, and they thrived especially in the Late Period, during the renaissance inaugurated by Psamtik, perhaps because they were seen as archetypally Egyptian, says Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist based at the  American University in Cairo\u2014a symbol of national identity when foreign influence was an ever-present threat. But they became even more popular under the Greeks, with millions of animals bred to order, presumably on nearby farms, and often sacrificed shortly after birth. Waziri and his colleagues found animal mummies of varying qualities, which were probably priced accordingly. X-rays reveal that some \u201cmummies\u201d have no cat remains inside at all. And the mix with human bones suggests that if priests ran out of space in the dedicated animal catacombs, they simply commandeered older human tombs. The animal cults, in other words, became an ever more significant economic and spiritual force, helping to drive Saqqara\u2019s final flourish. Or as Price puts it: \u201cSaqqara was like an enormous, divine magnet or battery, powered by all these animal mummies.\u201d\n  To the Greeks, part of the appeal of such Egyptian customs may have been the ease of making a personal plea to the gods, by visiting a stall selling mummified animals and choosing from a range of prepared products on offer. And the reward would likewise have been appealing: the promise, unique to Egyptian theology at that time, of an eternal afterlife of splendor. By contrast, \u201cGreek ideas for the afterlife were pretty dull,\u201d says Price. In classic Greek literature, for example, the dead were mere shadows inhabiting a dark underworld. The Babylonian and Jewish traditions had very exclusive notions of heaven; eternal life was reserved for the gods. But Egyptian texts covering the walls inside the Saqqara pyramids describe the king\u2019s soul rising up after death to join the sun in the sky. By around 2000 B.C., resurrection spells were written onto coffins directly, enabling even ordinary citizens such as Ta-Gemi to make the journey to idyllic, golden fields. Although the details of the afterlife changed over time, the most desirable postmortem destination during the Ptolemaic period was the \u201cField of Reeds,\u201d an agricultural paradise with unfailing harvests and eternal spring.\n      After Cleopatra ended her life in 30 B.C., bringing the Ptolemaic era to an end, Rome ruled Egypt. Whereas the Greeks had integrated into Egyptian culture, the Romans remade it, imposing their laws and administrative systems and, in time, their newly adopted Christian faith. At Saqqara, the last Egyptian mummies date to the third century A.D. Despite the cultural triumph of Rome, however, some Egyptian iconography lives on in Christian narratives. Many scholars have noted similarities between Egyptian and Christian religious symbolism, for example in stories of the goddess Isis and her son Horus and the Virgin Mary and her son Jesus. \u201cA lot of the iconography in Christianity is derived from ancient Egypt,\u201d says Ikram, of the American University in Cairo.\n    Which is not to say that these images were necessarily appropriated directly; rather, in antiquity these influences ran in many directions. The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, of Oxford, notes that Christian ideas of the afterlife in particular drew heavily on Greek belief, which by then had developed a \u201cvocabulary\u201d for concepts such as Plato\u2019s notion that the human soul \u201cmight reflect a divine force beyond itself.\u201d Plato, for his part, was influenced by Pythagoras, who is thought to have studied in Egypt in the sixth century B.C. \u201cBy the time Chris\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:47:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "saqqara,tombs,\u57c3\u53ca", "title": "\u5728Saqqara\u7684\u575f\u5893\u91cc\u9762 ", "title_en": "Inside The Tombs of Saqqara", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/inside-tombs-saqqara-180977932/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["saqqara", "tombs", "\u57c3\u53ca"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066924, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u7ec8\u6b62\u7ec8\u6b62\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5bf9\u4e8eC\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7410\u788e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136C\u578b\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u590d\u5236\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u51fd\u6570\u58f0\u79f0\u5728C.\u8f76\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u6e34\u671b\u5177\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u590d\u5236\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\n \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6574\u6570\u3002\n  \u8fd4\u56de\u540e\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u65f6\uff08\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u5668\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u5927\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u672a\u7ecf\u672a\u52ff\u7ed2\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6307\u5411\u5305\u542b\u6e90\u6781\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u3002 \uff08\u867d\u7136\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56de\u529b\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u6307\u793a\u5b83\u4ece\u6e90\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u793a\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002 \uff08\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u5141\u8bb8\u5904\u7406\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u8bfb\u53d6\u6216\u5199\u5165\u5b83\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u643a\u624b\u5408\u4f5c\uff1a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5199\u5165NUL\u5b57\u8282IT\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ece\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u8bfb\u53d6\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u786e\u5b9a\u5b83\u5df2\u586b\u5145\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u662f\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\uff08\u653e\u5bbd\u4e00\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff09\u3002\n  \u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u7b26\u5408ISO C\u6216POSIX.1\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6700\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u3002\n \u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8c03\u7528strxcpy\uff1a \nchar * strxcpy\uff08char *\u9650\u5236dst\uff0cconst char *\u9650\u5236src\uff0csize_t len\uff09{if\uff08\uff01len\uff09{return null; } whiled\uff08 -

While C-style strings are a fundamental part of using the language, manipulating them is a common source of security bugs and lost performance. One of the most common operations is copying a string from one buffer to another, and there are a variety of string functions that claim to do this in C. Anecdotally, however, there is much confusion about what they actually do, and many people desire a string copying function with the following properties:\n The function should accept a null-terminated source string, a destination buffer, and an integer representing the size of the destination buffer.\n  Upon return the function should ensure that the destination buffer points to a null-terminated string containing a prefix of the source string when possible (specifically, when the destination buffer has a non-zero size) to avoid issues in the future with unterminated strings. (While string truncation has its own issues, it is often a fairly reasonable fallback.)\n  The function should indicate how many characters it copied from the source, as well as indicate if an overflow occurred. (This allows for dealing with the overflow, if desired.)\n  The function should be efficient, and it should not read or write memory that it does not have to. These go partially hand-in-hand: the function should run in a single pass, not write to the destination buffer past the NUL byte it places, or read characters from the source string once it\u2019s determined that it has filled the destination buffer. Ideally, the implementation would be vectorizable (relaxing some of the previous constraints slightly to within platform alignment guarantees).\n  The function should be standardized, so that it may be used portably across systems. Conformance to  ISO C or  POSIX.1 are generally the most desirable.\n That is, what is often necessary is the function below, which we\u2019ll call  strxcpy:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t return  NULL ;\t }\t while  ( -- len  &amp;&amp;  ( * dst ++  =  * src ++ ))\t\t ;\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t * dst ++  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t\t return  * src  ?  NULL  :  dst ;\t }  else  {\t\t return  dst ;\t } }\n Other than standardization, this function will copy the smaller of  strlen(src) or  len - 1 bytes from  src to  dst and cap the copy with a NUL character. In the case where  src fits in  dst, it will return a pointer past the NUL byte it placed; otherwise it returns  NULL to indicate a truncation. While  current  compilers seem to have trouble with its control flow, it should also be fairly straightforwards to vectorize, as the core loop is somewhat similar to a combination of  strncpy and  strlen.\n With guidance to look back to, let\u2019s take a look at a variety of copying routines and see if they can help us.\n To head off the usual concerns, we\u2019ll assume that we must use C, and that we will be eschewing the various length-prefixed or aggregate string constructions available as third-party libraries. While using a different language can solve many of the issues in C besides the one mentioned here; it\u2019s not always desirable or even possible to utilize them. In addition to the usual drawbacks to using third-party libraries, replacing null-terminated strings often causes added syntactical overhead and incompatibilities with other code that has been designed to work with them.\n   The standard  strcpy function, which copies characters from  src to  dst, up to and including the first NUL byte encountered. If  dst is smaller than or aliases  src, then the behavior of the program is undefined.  dst is returned.\n strcpy certainly fulfills requirement 2 and parts of 4: it will always write out a null-terminated string and it\u2019ll do so quickly. However, it cannot perform bounds checks at all, so we can only use it if we know our destination buffer is smaller than our source buffer\u2013it fails requirement 1. Plus it doesn\u2019t tell us how many characters it wrote, either\u2013that\u2019s requirement 3. It\u2019s been part of C forever, so it does meet requirement 5.\n  strncpy copies up to  len characters from  src to  dst. If  src is shorter than  len, then  dst is NUL-padded to  len characters.  dst is returned.\n strncpy takes the parameters we want, so it satisfies requirement 1; even in the face of an arbitrary source string it won\u2019t exhibit undefined behavior, provided that we supply it with the correct destination buffer length. However, if the source is longer that the destination, the buffer will not be null-terminated, and if it is shorter  strncpy will continue writing NUL bytes to the destination up to its size. In addition, it doesn\u2019t indicate how many characters from the source were written, though it is possible to detect overflow by writing a NUL byte to the last character of the destination buffer and checking it after the call. That means it fails requirements 2, 3, and 4, but as it\u2019s been around in C for as long as  strcpy it does meet requirement 5.\n   memcpy doesn\u2019t care about NUL characters at all; it doesn\u2019t even require the source to be a null-terminated string. It fails the first three requirements right off the bat, but it\u2019s part of C and it sure is fast so it meets requirements 4 and 5.\n  strcpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strcpy that performs the same operation and returns zero except it can write unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, and if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, it will write a NUL byte to  *dst if possible, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function.\n On the surface, this function  seems useful\u2013but a closer look shows that it has a number of unfortunate issues. The largest is that any truncation will call a constraint handler function which can do many things,  like abort the program. In addition, it doesn\u2019t tell us how much it wrote, can scribble over the destination, and is standardized but only available as an optional extension to C11. Overall, it only satisfies requirement 1.\n  strncpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strncpy, that returns a non-zero value if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, in which case it will write the NUL byte to  *dst if possible, unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function. Otherwise is will copy  len bytes from  src to  dst and then add a NUL terminating byte at  dst[len - 1], returning zero.\n This function has the same constraint handler issue as  strcpy_s, and is also standardized but often not available. While it will null-terminate when the string fits and only clobber the destination on an error, it still only satisfies the first requirement.\n  Identical to  strncpy, except that a pointer to the written NUL byte is returned, if any; otherwise  dst + len is returned.\n stpncpy is an improvement on  strncpy, but it only fixes the issue of detecting termination or overflow, which is requirement 3. It still fails requirement 2 because it doesn\u2019t necessarily null-terminate and it fails requirement 4 because it writes NULs to the end of the destination buffer. Unlike  strncpy it\u2019s part of POSIX, but it still meets requirement 5 in addition to requirement 1.\n  When used with  %s as  fmt, copies the first variadic parameter (a string) to  dst, or the first  len - 1 bytes followed by the NUL byte. Returns the length of the first variadic parameter.\n snprintf is a somewhat strange inclusion, but it\u2019s a standard function that can help us if we use \u201c%s\u201d as the format string, taking a size and null-terminating its destination. It fulfills requirements 1, 2, and 5, but falls short on 3 and 4: its return value is essentially \u201cwhat  sprintf would have returned\u201d, which means it must perform an equivalent of a  strlen at the very least. This is slow, not what we want, and an  int (not a  size_t).\n  Semantically equivalent to  sprintf(dst, len, &#34;%s&#34;, src) save for the return value, which is a  size_t.\n strlcpy is identical to the  sprintf invocation from before, except it uses the correct  size_t return type. This still means it fails to satisfy the performance requirements of 3 and 4, and it\u2019s not standard so it doesn\u2019t satisfy 5 either. Since it does the copy and leaves you with a null-terminated string it fills the first two requirements.\n  strscpy copies  src to  dst if it fits in the buffer and return the number of characters copied excluding the trailing NUL byte; otherwise it will copy the first  len - 1 characters and set  dst[len - 1] to a NUL byte, returning  -E2BIG.\n strscpy is the first function we\u2019ve seen that satisfies the four functional requirements: it copies the as much of the source string as possible, null terminates the destination buffer, returns the number of characters copied, and does not perform excessive reads or writes. In fact, we can implement our  strxcpy function using it:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t ssize_t  copied  =  strscpy ( dst ,  src ,  len );\t return  copied  !=  - E2BIG  :  src  +  copied  +  1  :  NULL ; }\n It has two issues: the first, is that it returns an  ssize_t rather than a  size_t, but in practice this isn\u2019t really a problem. The second is that it\u2019s unfortunately non-standard\u2013it\u2019s something the Linux kernel wrote for itself\u2013which means it violates requirement 5.\n  memccpy is identical to  memcpy, but may stop prematurely if  src contains  chr, copying  chr and returning pointer after its location in  dst. If  len characters are copied without encountering  chr, then  NULL is returned.\n memccpy, when used with the NUL character, satisfies all the requirements except for the second one, but this is trivial to fix:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t char  * end  =  memccpy ( dst ,  src ,  &#39;\\0&#39; ,  len );\t if  ( ! end )  {\t\t dst [ len  -  1 ]  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t }\t return  end ; }\n While it\u2019ll ship in an upcoming C standard, it\u2019s already widely available as a popular, optional POSIX extension.\n  There\u2019s a couple of other functions\u2013 stpcpy,  mempcpy,  sprintf,  sprintf_s, and  snprintf_s\u2013that have been omitted for brevity, as their behavior (and issues) are fairly self-explanatory based on the other functions. ( mempcpy is a GNU extension.)\n  Copying strings in C is an extremely common operation, but doing so safely and efficiently is non-trivial. Almost all currently available string routines, standardized or not, have subtle quirks that often prevent them from matching the expectations of the programmer who reaches for them. This issue is compounded by the fact that many style guides or linters will recommend the use of one (or sometimes more than one!) of these functions to replace  strcpy without discussing their limitations. Finally, as we saw above the functions compose quite poorly: our  strxcpy, an academic but not improbable scenario, could not use any of them in its implementation; one can only imagine that those writing an ad-hoc replacement for it may make both errors in doing so.\n In contrast, the standardization of  memccpy is a very welcome improvement, as it facilitates the construction of safer and more efficient string algorithms\u2013in addition to  strxcpy, a number of the functions discussed are  also easy to construct with it. As it becomes more widespread, most code that relies on some of the semantics of  strxcpy but uses one of the other functions to achieve it should probably migrate to  memccpy, and ideally the push to phase out the use of them will drive the standardization and adoption of many more widely applicable string functions.\n Questions?

The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials.\n    We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality, in secondary outcomes, and in chemoprophylaxis, among people with, or at high risk of, COVID-19 infection.\n    We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion.\n    Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19\u20130.73; n = 2438; I 2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian\u2013Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff\u2013Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%\u201391%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for \u201cneed for mechanical ventilation,\u201d whereas effect estimates for \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201cdeterioration\u201d clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty. Evidence on other secondary outcomes was very low certainty.\n    Moderate-certainty evidence finds that large reductions in COVID-19 deaths are possible using ivermectin.

Additionally, their lineup will only consist of \u201ce-\u201d branded cars by 2028.\n  This isn\u2019t the first signal the German automaker would be shifting to electric. Earlier this year Duesmann said the European Union\u2019s strict emission guidelines helped push them to end development of new internal combustion engines (ICE).\n Audi recently unveiled the  2022 Audi Q4 e-tron. The electric crossover will come in three different trim options, and offer ranges varying from 200 miles (321km) up to 323 miles (520km) on a full charge.\n The automaker plans to introduce as many as 20 EV models in the next five years as part of parent company  Volkswagen\u2019s push to electrification.\n Editor\u2018s  note: A previous version of this article stated Audi would stop making gas cars by 2026. Instead, Audi will no longer bring new gas cars to market by 2026.
