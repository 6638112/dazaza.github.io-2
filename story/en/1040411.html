(That’s what “the complete stance” means.) We’ll look at what wonder is, what it implies, and what its value may be. And we’ll discuss how to cultivate wonder as a method for   adopting,   maintaining, and   stabilizing the complete stance; and as a prerequisite for other textures such as  curiosity,  play, and  creation.</p><p>奇怪的是，您同时感知到了模糊性和模式，而没有施加任何意义或无意义。 （这就是“完整立场”的意思。）我们将研究什么是奇迹，它意味着什么，以及它的价值是什么。我们将讨论如何培养奇迹，作为采用，维护和稳定整体立场的方法；并作为好奇，玩耍和创造等其他纹理的前提。</p><p>   Recall that a good way to understand the complete stance is by  comparison with peak experiences. That works here:</p><p>   回想一下，要了解完整的立场，最好的方法是与最佳经历进行比较。在这里工作：</p><p>  So what is awe? An influential psychological study found that it consists of perceiving overwhelmingness plus incomprehensibility.  1 It can be experienced as either ecstatic or terrifying, depending on whether the vastness, the overwhelmingness, seems threatening. The emotional intensity of awe motivates you to make sense of the experience; to expand your horizons to admit its meaning. That is what gives peak experiences their transformational power.  2</p><p>  那么敬畏是什么？一项有影响力的心理学研究发现，它包括感知压倒性加不可理解性。 1可以将其体验为狂喜还是惊恐，这取决于广阔，压倒性的威胁。敬畏的情感强度激发您去理解经验；扩大视野，承认它的含义。这就是使高峰体验获得变革动力的原因。 2</p><p> I suggest that wonder occurs in  heightened agendaless attention combined with  suspension of habitual interpretation. Heightened agendaless attention allows and perceives unexpected patterning; suspension of habitual interpretation allows and perceives unexpected nebulosity. This is what makes it a texture of the complete stance:  recall that the stance consists in recognizing pattern and nebulosity inseparably.</p><p> 我建议，在无议程的关注日益加深和中止惯性解释的同时，就会产生奇迹。无议程的关注度提高了，并且可以感知到意外的模式；习惯性解释的中止允许并感知到意想不到的模糊性。这就是使它成为完整姿态的原因：请记住，该姿态在于不可分割地识别模式和模糊性。</p><p> “Agendaless attention” means that you are not looking or listening for anything in particular. Wonder is not wonder ing. Instead, you appreciate the  vividness of pattern, the fascinating richness. That is what draws and heightens your attention. Wonder appreciates phenomena just as they are, for their own sake, not for some external value. It is a non-instrumental attitude. (We’ll come back to this as a major theme in the  play page, and then again in the  complete stance for purpose.)</p><p> “无休止的关注”意味着您没有在寻找或聆听任何特别的声音。奇迹不是奇迹。相反，您会欣赏到图案的生动感和令人着迷的丰富性。这就是吸引并引起您注意的地方。 Wonder出于自身的原因而不是出于某种外部价值来欣赏现象。这是一种非工具性的态度。 （我们将在播放页面中将其作为主要主题再次讨论，然后再以完整的立场再作说明。）</p><p> “Habitual interpretation” is the usually-automatic, unthinking, barely noticed, nearly-instantaneous perceptual process that assigns meanings to phenomena, or dismisses them as meaningless. Eternalism is hard to overcome because we normally  see meanings, as if they were objectively given.  3 We see vomit on the sidewalk  as revolting, a smile  as flirtatious, a bit of fluff on the carpet  as meaningless.  Suspending interpretation means  allowing   meaningness: neither imposing nor opposing meaning; leaving it alone as it is, not messing with it. Wonder grants instant freedom from  metaphysical confusions: not because you resolve them conceptually, but because you have set aside their implications.</p><p> “习惯性解释”是通常自动执行的，未思考的，鲜为人知的，近乎瞬时的感知过程，可将现象赋予含义或将其视为无意义。永恒主义很难克服，因为我们通常会看到含义，就像它们是客观给出的一样。 3我们看到人行道上的呕吐令人反感，微笑像轻浮，地毯上的一点绒毛毫无意义。悬而未决的解释意味着允许意义：既不强加也不反对。保持原样，不要弄乱它。 Wonder可以立即摆脱形而上的混乱：这不是因为您从概念上解决了问题，而是因为您已经排除了它们的含意。</p><p> Now we can understand awe more precisely: as  forced wonder. Overwhelmingness compels attention, and makes it agendaless by eliminating any possibility of effective action. Incomprehensibility makes habitual interpretations impossible. Thus, in awe it is impossible  not to perceive pattern and nebulosity simultaneously.</p><p> 现在我们可以更精确地理解敬畏了：作为强迫的奇迹。压倒性的压力会引起人们的注意，并且通过消除任何可能采取有效行动的可能性而使其变得毫无议程。不可理解使习惯性的解释成为不可能。因此，敬畏的是不可能不同时感知模式和雾状。 </p><p> As this page progresses, we’ll see ways wonder differs from awe in terms of the points of contrast between the complete stance and peak experiences:  4</p><p>随着本页的进展，我们会发现，就完全立场和最佳体验之间的对比而言，奇迹与敬畏的方式有所不同：4</p><p> Awe is rare—because overwhelming, incomprehensible situations are usually dangerous, or else soon become overly familiar. Wonder can occur frequently.</p><p> 敬畏是罕见的，因为压倒性的情况通常很危险，否则很快就会变得过于熟悉。奇迹会经常发生。</p><p> Awe’s overwhelming emotions and its incomprehension prevent conceptual thought. It can be stupefying as it occurs, though it may motivate subsequent work at understanding. Wonder may involve intricate conceptual thinking (or not).</p><p> Awe的压倒性情绪及其理解力阻碍了概念思考。尽管它可能会激发以后的理解工作，但它可能会令人震惊。奇迹可能涉及（或不涉及）复杂的概念思考。</p><p>   Wonder is a natural way of being. It’s not esoteric or  special. You may often adopt it briefly, without even noticing—if you don’t recognize its significance, and don’t know what to look for.</p><p>   奇迹是自然存在的方式。这不是深奥的或特殊的。如果您不认识它的重要性并且不知道要寻找什么，则可能经常会简短地采用它，甚至没有注意到。</p><p> Let’s do an example. There’s a black scallop shell in the corner of my window. I noticed, from across the room, the sun glinting on the web a spider had built across it. There was a moment of revulsion at the mess—but, without thinking, I suspended that habitual interpretation.</p><p> 让我们举个例子。我窗户的角落有一个扇贝贝壳。我从房间对面注意到，阳光照在蜘蛛网上，蜘蛛在上面横扫。乱七八糟的时候片刻让我感到愤慨，但是我没有思考，便中止了这种习惯性的解释。</p><p> Unexpected beauty had captured my attention. Walking across to the window, spots of dust stuck to strands of the web were glittering. (I’m afraid the photo does not accurately show the effect, due to camera limitations. Maybe you can supply the gleam from memories of similar scenes.)</p><p> 出乎意料的美丽吸引了我的注意。穿过窗户，粘在网上的灰尘点闪闪发光。 （由于相机的限制，恐怕照片无法准确显示效果。也许您可以从类似场景的记忆中得到微光。）</p><p> Like stars in the night sky. I stopped and just looked, enjoying their brilliance, for perhaps a second or less.</p><p> 就像夜空中的星星。我停了下来，只是看着，享受着他们的光辉，也许只有一秒钟或更短的时间。 </p><p> It occurred to me then that the bejeweled spider-strands looked like  galaxy filaments, the largest known structures in the universe.</p><p>当时我突然想到，宝石般的蜘蛛链看上去像银河丝，是宇宙中已知的最大结构。</p><p>  Wonder is intrinsic, non-referential; it involves no external purpose. In the moment, none of this was either meaningful or meaningless. Not the visual activity of my eyes moving from point to point, not the feeling of unexpected enjoyment, not the conceptual analogy between dust motes and galaxies. These were just present, as-they-were—because my heightened attention was agendaless.</p><p>  奇迹是内在的，非指称的；它不涉及外部目的。目前，这些都不是有意义或毫无意义的。不是我的眼睛的视觉活动到处移动，不是我意想不到的愉悦感，不是尘埃和星系之间的概念类比。这些只是存在的，因为我的高度关注是毫无议程的。</p><p> If I had not been writing about wonder, I would have left them there. The entire event took only seconds, and I would immediately have forgotten it. Meaningfulness and meaninglessness were equally irrelevant.</p><p> 如果我没有写奇迹，我会把它们留在那里。整个事件只花了几秒钟，而我会立即忘记它。意义和无意义同样无关紧要。</p><p> As wonder is a texture of the complete stance, eternalism and nihilism are both naturally opposed to it.</p><p> 令人惊讶的是，这是一种完整立场的纹理，永恒主义和虚无主义都自然地反对它。</p><p> The eternalist impulse is to turn this into something  special: a Meaningful Experience. A   dualist eternalist might say this was a moment of grace, granted by God, revealing the majesty of His Creation. A   monist eternalist might say I had a profound revelation of the unity of the Macrocosm and the Microcosm; “ as above, so below.” A physics crank might invent some theory about how the cosmic web is causally similar to a spider’s.</p><p> 永恒的冲动是将其变成一种特殊的东西：有意义的经历。双重主义永恒主义者可能会说这是上帝赋予的恩典时刻，彰显了祂创造的威严。一元论的永恒主义者可能会说我对宏观世界和微观世界的统一有深刻的启示。 “ 以下如上。”物理学上的怪人可能会发明一些理论，关于宇宙网与蜘蛛的因果相似。</p><p> The nihilist impulse is to dismiss it as obviously meaningless. Spider webs are utterly mundane and  ordinary. They have nothing in common with the large-scale structure of the universe, apart from a purely coincidental and superficial visual similarity. There is, as a matter of objective fact, no meaningful connection between dust specks and galaxies. This whole thing was a straightforward cognitive error, embroidered into an emotional fantasy, in order to preserve the delusion that life has some sort of “meaning” beyond animals being wired up to maximize their evolutionary fitness.</p><p> 虚无主义的冲动将其视为毫无意义。蜘蛛网完全是普通的。除了纯粹的巧合和表面上的视觉相似性外，它们与宇宙的大规模结构没有任何共同之处。作为客观事实，尘埃斑点和星系之间没有有意义的联系。整个过程都是一个直接的认知错误，被绣成一种情感幻想，目的是保留这样一种幻想，即除了将动物连接起来以最大化其进化适应性之外，生命还具有某种“意义”。</p><p> Both these impulses terminate wonder as soon as it you notice it, inhibiting the natural process.</p><p> 一旦发现，这两种冲动都会终止奇迹，从而抑制自然过程。 </p><p> On the other hand, if you  don’t notice wonder when it arises spontaneously, then you don’t cut it off by reflex—but maybe you don’t get much benefit from it, either.</p><p>另一方面，如果您不知道它是何时自发出现的，那么您就不会通过反射来切断它，但也许您也不会从中受益。</p><p> In this case, wonder lasted perhaps three seconds. I had seen what there was to be seen. I walked away.</p><p> 在这种情况下，奇迹持续了大约三秒钟。我已经看到了将要看到的东西。我走开了</p><p> But it turned out that there was meaning in it after all. In wonder, there is no external purpose; but a minute later, it occurred to me to use the example here. Perhaps it will help you notice your own moments of everyday wonder.</p><p> 但事实证明，其中毕竟有含义。奇怪的是，没有外部目的。但是一分钟后，我想到在这里使用示例。也许它将帮助您注意到自己每天奇妙的时刻。</p><p> The  overview of textures explained that wonder leads to curiosity, and then to humor, and play, and enjoyment, and creation. I hope you can see how each of those contributed to the writing of this little story.</p><p> 纹理概述说明，奇迹会导致好奇心，然后导致幽默，游戏，娱乐和创造。我希望您能看到每个人如何帮助撰写这个小故事。</p><p>  All   stances have thinking, feeling, and activity aspects, which pervade their textures. The previous section explained wonder’s activity aspect, consisting just of heightened attention and the suspension (non-activity!  5) of interpretation. Here I’ll cover feelings typical of wonder; then we’ll do thinking in the next section.</p><p>  所有姿势都具有思维，感觉和活动方面的内容，这些方面普遍存在。上一节解释了奇迹的活动方面，其中包括高度重视和中止解释（不活动！5）。在这里，我将介绍奇妙的感觉；那么我们将在下一部分中进行思考。</p><p>  Fixed meanings are claustrophobic. “Ugh, dirty, and I’m stuck in a house  6 full of spiders, they’re creepy, maybe poisonous, I don’t want to have to clean this up, it’s a hassle, I don’t have time for it, I have  other stupid stuff I have to do.” All that in a fraction of a second: not as thoughts articulated in words, but as the overall, oppressive gestalt of the encounter.</p><p>  固定的含义是幽闭恐惧症。 “丑陋，肮脏，我被困在满是蜘蛛的6屋子里，它们令人毛骨悚然，甚至有毒，我不想清理这些东西，这很麻烦，我没有时间这样做，我还有其他愚蠢的事情要做。”所有这些只需不到一秒钟的时间：不是像用言语表达的思想，而是作为相遇的整体压抑形像。</p><p> The routine meanings of a situation block your view of it. Habitual categorization suppresses details; it dulls the senses. I felt shut in a small box, confined in space and time and possibilities for action. But bright sunlight drew my attention sharply, my perception became agendaless, I saw vivid details I would otherwise have overlooked, and so other meanings were revealed.</p><p> 情境的例行含义会阻止您对此进行查看。习惯性分类会压制细节。它会使感官变钝。我觉得自己被关在一个小盒子里，限于时间和空间以及行动的可能性。但是明亮的阳光吸引了我的注意力，我的感知变得毫无意义，我看到了本来可以忽略的生动细节，所以其他含义也被揭示了出来。 </p><p> Re-seeing the web as beautiful, the usual interpretations fell away. It’s not that I realized they were untrue—all my complaints  were true, pretty much. It’s that they were suspended; ceased to have any relevance.</p><p>重新将网络视为美丽，通常的解释就消失了。不是我意识到他们是不真实的，我的所有抱怨几乎都是真实的。因为他们被暂停了；不再有任何关联。</p><p> Aesthetic appreciation, fascination with beauty in its intricate specificity, typically accompanies wonder. Heightened agendaless attention can perceive the unexpected, which reveals  freshness: whatever you see, hear, smell, taste or touch is unique, not merely another instance of a familiar category. Wonder is almost synonymous with amazement, astonishment, and perplexity. Reality is a delicious surprise. Not a surprise as in “maybe this will happen, or maybe that, but I expect  this”—and then you get  that. Surprise as in “I couldn’t have imagined this beforehand.”</p><p> 审美欣赏，对复杂细节的迷恋通常伴随着奇迹。无议程的注意力的增强可以感知到意料之外的事物，这突显了新鲜感：无论您看到，听到，闻到，品尝或触摸到的事物都是独特的，而不仅仅是熟悉类别的另一个实例。奇迹几乎是惊奇，惊讶和困惑的代名词。现实是一个美味的惊喜。不足为奇，例如“也许会发生，或者那会发生，但我希望如此”，然后您就会明白。惊奇地发现，“我以前无法想象这一点。”</p><p> Wonder is the feeling of accepting contact with nebulosity. Wonder requires  willingness to allow chaos, uncertainty, ambiguity, discontinuity, meaninglessness.</p><p> 奇迹是接受与星云联系的感觉。奇迹要求愿意允许混乱，不确定，模棱两可，间断，无意义。</p><p> Wonder is ambivalent. In wonder, there are no set boundaries, and the world opens up into vastness. That can come as a release and a relief; or you may feel agoraphobia. You realize nothing is altogether solid, and that groundlessness provokes  vertigo. If eternalism or nihilism is habitual, wonder’s open-endedness—its non-confirmation of your stance toward meaning—seems threatening.  7 That’s why there’s an immediate urge to shut it down by insisting that whatever is happening is either meaningful or meaningless, rather than letting it be.</p><p> 奇迹是矛盾的。奇怪的是，没有设定的界限，世界打开了广阔的天空。这可以作为一种释放和一种解脱；否则您可能会感到恐惧症。您意识到没有什么是完全牢固的，而毫无根据的则引起了眩晕。如果永恒主义或虚无主义是习惯性行为，那么惊奇的开放性（即您对意义立场的非确认）似乎是威胁。 7这就是为什么我们迫切希望通过坚持认为发生的一切有意义或无意义而不是顺其自然而将其关闭。</p><p> The   confused stances are defenses against the anxiety of nebulosity. Stabilizing the complete stance involves learning from practice how and when you can tolerate it—or enjoy it.</p><p> 困惑的立场是对星云焦虑的防御。稳定完整的姿态涉及从实践中学习如何以及何时可以容忍（或享受）它。</p><p> That is the cost of  freedom. It is the exit toll you pay for stepping out of a musty, dingy box into a bigger, brighter, stranger world. It is the price for freshness, appreciation, and insight. Wonder is the prerequisite too for curiosity, humor, play, enjoyment, and creation; they rest on clouds. They are often joyful, but inevitably also sometimes queasy.</p><p> 那就是自由的代价。这是您为走出霉烂，肮脏的盒子进入更大，更明亮，更陌生的世界而付出的出路费。这是新鲜感，欣赏力和洞察力的价格。好奇心，幽默感，娱乐性，创造力也是创造奇迹的前提。他们在云上休息。他们通常很快乐，但有时也很不安。</p><p>  Studies of awe have found that it can be provoked by conceptual vastness, just as by perceptual vastness. Encountering an overwhelmingly powerful, initially incomprehensible intellectual system can blow you away.  8 You recognize that its vast sweep implies you will be forced to reevaluate much of what you thought you understood—which might radically change how you think, feel, and act—but specifically  what requires revision is obscure until you have assimilated it.</p><p>  对敬畏的研究发现，它可以由概念上的巨大和感知上的巨大引起。遇到功能强大，起初难以理解的知识体系会使您震惊。 8您认识到它的广泛应用意味着您将不得不重新评估自己认为理解的许多内容，这可能会从根本上改变您的思维，感受和行为，但是具体来说，需要修改的内容在您被吸收之前是晦涩的。 </p><p> Let’s call the analog of conceptual awe “intellectual wonder.” As a response to incomprehensibility, we can contrast it with wondering and with bafflement.  Wondering has a specific question in mind, and expects a specific form of answer. (I’ll call this “ closed-ended curiosity” on the next page.) It may involve heightened attention, but does not suspend habitual interpretations.  Bafflement is the inability to even get started on making sense. Familiar meanings are suspended because they’re obviously irrelevant, but you cannot bring conceptual attention to bear, so you are incurious.  Intellectual wonder recognizes that your existing systems of meaning cannot encompass the new one, so you must suspend your usual ways of thinking. Simultaneously, the new one is fascinating, so it draws your attention to its intricate details; but you don’t yet know what to attend to, so it is agendaless. (This leads naturally to “ open-ended curiosity,” which is similar, but more active, directed.)</p><p>让我们将概念敬畏的类比称为“智力奇迹”。作为对不可理解性的回应，我们可以将它与好奇和困惑相提并论。想知道有一个特定的问题，并且期望有特定形式的答案。 （我将在下一页将此称为“封闭式好奇心”。）它可能会引起人们的更多关注，但不会暂停习惯性的解释。折磨是无法理解的。熟悉的意义已被暂停，因为它们显然无关紧要，但是您无法在概念上引起注意，所以您很好奇。理智的奇迹认识到您现有的意义系统不能包含新的意义系统，因此您必须中止通常的思维方式。同时，新产品令人着迷，因此吸引您注意其复杂的细节。但您尚不知道该参加什么，所以它没有议程。 （这自然会导致“开放式好奇心”，这是相似的，但更为主动的指示。）</p><p>  Understanding gained from wonder is nebulous, especially initially. The complete stance recognizes that  all understanding is nebulous—whereas  complete understanding is a  false promise of eternalism. However, the new meanings emerging in wonder should later be tested and reconciled with one’s other, more solid understandings. Apparent insights may be productive, or not. The spider web/cosmic web analogy was spurious and unproductive (other than for its use here). A famously valuable example was August Kekulé’s breakthrough understanding of the chemical structure of benzene  in a dream of the ouroboros—a snake biting its own tail.  9</p><p>  从奇迹中获得的理解是模糊的，尤其是在最初。完全的立场承认所有理解都是模糊的，而完全的理解是永恒主义的错误承诺。但是，奇迹中出现的新含义应在以后进行测试，并与他人的其他更扎实的理解保持一致。明显的见解可能会产生效果，或者没有效果。蜘蛛网/宇宙网的类比是虚假的，没有生产力（除了此处使用）。一个著名的有价值的例子是奥古斯特·库库莱（AugustKekulé）在梦见衔尾蛇（一条蛇咬自己的尾巴）时对苯的化学结构的突破性理解。 9</p><p> Insight opens new possibilities for action: alternative responses to situations and feelings. This points the way into the more active textures of the complete stance. You are freed for  curiosity,  play, and  creation.</p><p> 洞察力为行动提供了新的可能性：对情况和感觉的替代反应。这指出了进入完整姿态的更活跃纹理的方式。您会因为好奇心，游戏和创造而得到释放。</p><p>  To the extent that you have stabilized the complete stance, its six textures often occur naturally and effortlessly. Short of that, the textures can also be used as methods for   adopting and   stabilizing it.</p><p>  只要您稳定了整个姿势，它的六种纹理通常就会自然而轻松地出现。除此之外，纹理也可以用作采用和稳定纹理的方法。</p><p> Wonder is the most receptive, least active texture, so it’s harder to apply deliberately than the others. You can’t just say “right, I’ll do an hour’s worth of wonder now, and then have lunch.” (Or anyway I can’t!)</p><p> Wonder是最容易接受，最不活跃的纹理，因此比其他纹理更难以刻意应用。您不能只说“对，我现在要做一个小时的奇事，然后吃午餐。” （或者无论如何我都做不到！）</p><p> That there is no specific method for producing wonder may contribute to the misleading and counterproductive sense of  specialness around it. It helps to consider it  no big deal; something to enjoy when it occurs, but not something to try to hold onto, crank up artificially, or make a fuss about after the fact.</p><p> 没有特殊的产生奇迹的方法可能会导致其周围产生误导和适得其反的特殊感。认为没什么大不了；当事情发生时会享受一些乐趣，但不要试图抓住，捏造或者在事后大惊小怪。</p><p> On the other hand, wonder is not a subjective experience;  10 it’s not something that just happens to you, like awe. It does have subtle  doing components: attention and suspension.</p><p> 另一方面，奇迹不是主观的体验。 10它不是像敬畏之类发生在您身上的事情。它确实有一些细微的组成部分：注意力和悬念。 </p><p> The circumstances conducive for awe may also produce wonder. Going to a concert  just in order to find wonder might be slightly silly (or not!). But if you are going to one  anyway, you could maintain background awareness that wonder (or awe)  might occur, and intend to  notice and  allow it if it does.</p><p>有利于敬畏的环境也可能产生奇迹。仅仅为了发现奇迹而去听音乐会可能有点愚蠢（或者不是！）。但是，无论如何，您都可以保持背景意识，以免发生奇迹（或敬畏），并打算注意到并允许它发生。</p><p> So in fact the method for wonder is: wonder at wonder! Recall that wonder is heightened agendaless attention plus suspension of interpretation. When wonder occurs, maintain heightened agendaless attention  to attention itself, and suspend interpretation  of suspended interpretation. Attention to attention intensifies wonder. Suspension of interpretation of interpretation allows it to persist. (If you think “oh, yes, I seem to have suspended interpretation, so this must be wonder, which means I’m adopting the complete stance, so the next thing is, I have to figure out what ‘the inseparability of nebulosity and pattern’ is supposed to mean”—then the moment is lost, and wonder collapses into a fixed system of conceptual interpretation you read about on  some website.)</p><p> 因此，事实上，惊奇的方法是：惊奇！回想一下，奇迹得到了越来越多的关注，加上暂停了解释。当发生奇迹时，请保持对议程本身的高度关注，并暂停解释。注意引起人们的注意。暂停解释的解释可以使其持续存在。 （如果您认为“哦，是的，我似乎暂停了解释，那么这一定是奇怪的，这意味着我正在采用完整的立场，因此，接下来的事情是，我必须弄清楚“星云和模式”应该意味着“”，然后瞬间消失了，奇迹就变成了您在某个网站上读到的固定的概念解释系统。）</p><p> Noticing wonder requires knowing what it is like: the associated thoughts, feelings, and (in)actions. I hope this page gives a preliminary, conceptual sense of that. Practice develops a non-conceptual familiarity, which is more reliable.</p><p> 注意到奇迹需要知道它是什么样的：相关的思想，感觉和行动。我希望该页面对此有初步的概念意义。实践会发展出一种非概念上的熟悉度，这是更可靠的。</p><p> Many meditation methods that aim at “emptiness”—nebulosity,  roughly—train you to suspend interpretation. These do seem to facilitate wonder. It  is possible to decide to suspend interpretation for an hour before lunch.</p><p> 许多针对“空虚”的冥想方法（大致是模糊性）会训练您中止解释。这些似乎确实促进了奇迹。可以决定在午餐前一个小时暂停翻译。</p><p> There are meditation methods that train you in heightened attention—including, in some cases, attention to attention. However, nearly all aim at single-pointed focus for a particular purpose. I do not know of one that specifically trains you in the agendaless attention that wanders about according to its evolving fascinations.  11 The poet Robert Bly recommends training in art appreciation for this purpose; he describes it as “ sharpening the senses by labor.”</p><p> 有一些冥想方法可以训练您注意力，包括在某些情况下注意注意力。但是，几乎所有目标都是针对特定目的的单点聚焦。我不知道有谁会特别训练您如何根据其不断发展的着迷而徘徊在无议程的关注中。 11诗人罗伯特·布莱（Robert Bly）建议为此目的进行艺术欣赏方面的培训。他将其描述为“通过劳动来增强感官”。</p><p>    I’ll tell you a story that gave me a moment of intellectual wonder. It may or may not for you!</p><p>    我给你讲一个故事，这让我有一点智慧。它可能适合您，也可能不适合您！</p><p> What I suggest is that, as you read it, you maintain awareness of the possibility of noticing heightened, agendaless, conceptual attention, and the possibility of suspending of your usual understanding. At a certain point in the story, you may notice a slightly uncanny frisson of disorientation. Then, metaphorically, your ears may suddenly prick up—you may find yourself fascinated. Your mind may dart in all directions looking for answers, or you may want to read on as quickly as possible. I suggest instead that you stop for a moment then, and pay attention to the feelings, and what you are thinking, and what you are wanting to do. Then proceed slowly, dividing your attention between the story and watching your own attention and interpretation. And allow the story to not make sense for a moment, but do not attempt to make your allowing incomprehension to mean anything itself.</p><p> 我的建议是，当您阅读本书时，您应该意识到以下几点：可能会注意到更多，毫无议程的概念性注意，以及中止通常理解的可能性。在故事的某个点上，您可能会注意到迷失方向有点不可思议的弗里森。然后，隐喻地，您的耳朵可能会突然p起-您可能会发现自己着迷。您的思维可能会四处搜寻，以寻找答案，或者您可能希望尽快阅读。相反，我建议您停一会儿，注意感受，想想的事和想做的事。然后慢慢进行，将您的注意力集中在故事之间，并观察自己的注意力和解释。暂时不要让故事变得毫无意义，但不要试图让您的不理解意味着任何东西。 </p><p> In 1765, surveyor Jeremiah Dixon and astronomer Charles Mason of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England, set out to survey the Pennsylvania-Maryland border—later known as the Mason-Dixon Line. It took two years to mark the boundary across 233 miles. Through uninhabited wilderness, dense forests, hostile Indian territory, up and down mountains, they made painstaking observations using delicate, state-of-the-art scientific instruments. Mason’s astronomical career was devoted to the most pressing technological challenge of the time: accurately determining one’s geographical position, especially when at sea. The best method involved using a highly accurate clock and fancy telescopes, which they brought.</p><p>1765年，英国格林威治皇家天文台的测量员耶利米·迪克森（Jeremiah Dixon）和天文学家查尔斯·梅森（Charles Mason）着手调查宾夕法尼亚州与马里兰州的边界，后称梅森-狄克逊线。花费了两年时间才划定了233英里的边界。在无人居住的荒野，茂密的森林，充满敌意的印度领土，上下山之间，他们使用精致而先进的科学仪器进行了艰苦的观察。梅森的天文事业致力于应对当时最紧迫的技术挑战：准确确定自己的地理位置，尤其是在海上。最好的方法是使用他们带来的高精度时钟和高档望远镜。</p><p> The boundary was legally defined as running due west from a specific point, so for the survey it was mainly important to get the latitude—the north/south coordinate—right. For this, Mason and Dixon used a  zenith sector. That was a six-foot telescope mounted on a wheel, like in the picture above. Tick marks on the wheel told them the telescope’s angle from straight up. The wheel was mounted on a tripod that they adjusted to verticality using a plumb bob—a weight on a string that points straight down. By locating stars in the telescope, checking their angles from the vertical, and consulting tables that said where they should appear at what time of night, they could determine their position. As a simplified example, as you go north, the pole star appears to move higher above the horizon, and closer to the zenith—the point in the sky directly above you.</p><p> 边界在法律上被定义为从特定点向西延伸，因此对于调查而言，正确确定纬度（南北坐标）非常重要。为此，Mason和Dixon使用了天顶扇区。如上图所示，那是一个安装在轮子上的六英尺望远镜。方向盘上的刻度线告诉他们望远镜从垂直向上的角度。车轮安装在三脚架上，然后使用铅锤将其调整到垂直度-弦上的重物指向下方。通过在望远镜中定位星星，检查它们与垂直方向的角度，并查阅表说它们应该在晚上的什么时间出现，就可以确定它们的位置。举一个简化的例子，当您向北行驶时，极星看起来似乎在地平线上方移动得更高，而在天顶附近（您上方的天空中的点）则更近。</p><p> From first principles, they calculated that their position error should not be more than fifty feet. Yet over the course of the survey, they repeatedly found anomalies of several hundred feet. They attributed this to imprecision in the instruments, which they corrected by taking multiple measurements and averaging. Or so they thought! But they were wrong. In fact, the line they laid out does repeatedly veer hundreds of feet off from straight east-west.  12 And not at random…</p><p> 根据第一原理，他们计算出位置误差不应超过五十英尺。然而，在调查过程中，他们反复发现了数百英尺的异常。他们将其归因于仪器的不精确性，他们通过进行多次测量和求平均值来纠正了错误。还是他们以为！但是他们错了。实际上，他们布置的线确实反复偏离了直线的东西方向数百英尺。 12并非随意...</p><p> When Mason got back to Greenwich, his boss, the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, suspected a different explanation. Newton’s theory of gravitation had been thoroughly confirmed as applying to planets. In principle, it was supposed to apply to any sufficiently large object, but there was no evidence for this. However, physicists had calculated that it should be just barely possible to measure the gravitational force exerted by a mountain using instruments as precise as were then available. Maskelyne guessed that the anomalies Mason and Dixon noted were due partly to the Allegheny Ranges, which they repeatedly crossed. Mountains to the immediate north or south of their path had sucked the plumb bob sideways, toward themselves. That threw off the verticality of the azimuth sector, which did not point straight up as it should.</p><p> 梅森（Mason）回到格林威治（Greenwich）时，他的老板，天文学家Royal Nevil Maskelyne怀疑是另一种解释。牛顿的万有引力理论已被完全证实适用于行星。原则上，它应该适用于任何足够大的对象，但是没有证据表明这一点。但是，物理学家计算得出，使用当时可用的精确仪器来测量山所施加的重力几乎是不可能的。马斯凯琳（Masselyne）猜测，梅森（Mason）和迪克森（Dixon）指出的异常现象部分是由于他们反复穿越的阿勒格尼山脉（Allegheny Ranges）所致。路径正北或偏南的山脉已将铅锤向侧面吸去。这就消除了方位角扇区的垂直性，而该垂直度并没有像应有的那样向上指向。</p><p> In 1772, Maskelyne submitted a funding proposal to test the hypothesis.  13 Money came through in 1773, and Maskelyne put Mason on the job of finding a suitable mass. Mason chose Schiehallion, an isolated Scottish peak whose nearly-symmetrical conical shape would simplify calculations. Using a ten-foot azimuth sector, Maskelyne confirmed that the mountain did deflect the plumb-bob. This was a spectacular confirmation of Newtonian gravitation. The amount of the deflection, together with the measured geometry of the peak, made it possible to calculate the ratio of the density of mountain rock (which was known) with that </p><p> 1772年，马斯凯琳（Masselyne）提出了一项资助提案，以检验这一假设。 13金钱在1773年问世，Masselyne使梅森开始寻找合适的质量。梅森选择了Schiehallion，这是一个孤立的苏格兰峰，其圆锥形几乎对称，可以简化计算。 Maskelyne使用十英尺的方位角扇区，确认山确实使铅锤偏斜。这是牛顿引力的壮观证实。偏转量以及测得的峰的几何形状使得计算山岩密度（已知）与密度之比成为可能。</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://meaningness.com/wonder">https://meaningness.com/wonder</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/奇迹/">#奇迹</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
