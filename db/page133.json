While the average vehicle age has risen steadily over the last 15 years, the trend accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic partly because of  a drop in new-car sales, IHS said.\n  The finding reflects the stronger value of vehicles throughout their life cycles, from higher new-vehicle prices Americans have been paying for years to  steeper prices on the used-car lot, said Todd Campau, associate director of aftermarket solutions at IHS. Improved vehicle quality also is a factor, he said.\n  Whereas 20 years ago a car might have changed hands once or twice and lasted 100,000 miles, it is more common today for a car to have multiple owners and last for 200,000 miles or more, he said.\n  \u201cThat has extended the life cycle of the vehicle and created value for more buyers up and down the chain,\u201d Mr. Campau. \u201cFor that second or third or fourth owner, there\u2019s still meat on the bone.\u201d\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

", "note_en": "Practical Common Lisp contains introductory material as well aspractical examples, such as a unit testing framework, web server, spamfilter and ID3 tag parser.\n  ANSI Common Lisp is a book for Lisp beginners. It has a niceexample of writing a simple ray tracer in Common Lisp, and another (ratherdated) example of using macros to generate HTML.\n ANSI Common Lisp combines an introduction to Lisp programming, and aconvenient, up-to-date reference manual for ANSI Common Lisp. Beginnerswill find that its careful explanations and interesting examples make Lispprogramming easy to learn. Professional programmers will appreciate itsthorough, practical approach.\n  On Lisp is \u201ca comprehensive studyof advanced Lisp techniques, with bottom-up programming as the unifyingtheme\u201d.\n The book also covers important subjects related to bottom-up programming,including functional programming, rapid prototyping, interactivedevelopment, and embedded languages. The final chapter takes a deeper lookat object-oriented programming than previous Lisp books, showing thestep-by-step construction of a working model of the Common Lisp ObjectSystem (CLOS).\n  With his brilliantly quirky comics and out-of-this-world games, longtimeLisper Conrad Barski teaches you the mysteries of Common Lisp. You\u2019ll startwith the basics, like list manipulation, I/O, and recursion, then move onto more complex topics like macros, higher order programming, anddomain-specific languages. Then, when your brain overheats, you can kickback with an action-packed comic book interlude!\n You can get an idea of the book\u2019s style in this tutorial by the same author:  Casting SPELs in Lisp\n  This book is about macros, that is programs that write programs. Macros arewhat make lisp the greatest programming language in the world. When usedproperly, macros enable amazing feats of abstraction, programmerproductivity, and code efficiency and security that are unheard ofelsewhere. Macros let you do things you simply cannot do in otherlanguages.\n If you are looking for a dry coding manual that re-hashes common-sensetechniques in whatever langue du jour, this book is not for you. This bookis about pushing the boundaries of what we know about programming. Whilethis book teaches useful macro skills that can help solve your programmingproblems today and now, it has also been designed to be entertaining andinspiring. If you have ever wondered what lisp or even programming itselfis really about, this is the book you have been looking for.\n  Professional Automated Trading: Theory and Practice uses CommonLisp to describe the implementation of automated trading systems.\n Reflecting author Eugene Durenard\u2019s extensive experience in this field,Professional Automated Trading offers valuable insights you won\u2019t findanywhere else. It reveals how a series of concepts and techniques comingfrom current research in artificial life and modern control theory can beapplied to the design of effective trading systems that outperform themajority of published trading systems. It also skillfully provides you withessential information on the practical coding and implementation of ascalable systematic trading architecture.\n    Common Lisp Recipes is a bookevery Common Lisper should keep within arm\u2019s reach.\n  Common Lisp Recipes is a collection of solutions to problemsand answers to questions you are likely to encounter when writingreal-world applications in Common Lisp. Written by an author whohas used Common Lisp in many successful commercial projects overmore than a decade, this book covers areas as diverse as webprogramming, databases, graphical user interfaces, integrationwith other programming languages, multi-threading, and mobiledevices as well as debugging techniques and optimization, to namejust a few. It is also the first Common Lisp book to tackle suchadvanced topics as environment access, logical pathnames, Graystreams, delivery of executables, pretty printing, setfexpansions, or changing the syntax of Common Lisp.\n Common Lisp Recipes is written in a style that mixes hands-on,no frills pragmatism with precise information and prudentmentorship.\n  If you are unsure how to create executables, fighting with library versionconflicts, or struggling with reproducible builds then this book can saveyou hours.\n The text lays out a framework that solves these issues. It works both forstandalone applications and for programs that run from source code.\n Understanding and using the framework does not require any advanced Lispknowledge.

Its success has, of course,\rendlessly tempted people to improve upon it. Thus, C is probably the patriarch of the\rlongest list of languages. Notable among these are C++, the D programming language,\rand most recently, Go. There are endless discussion threads on how to fix C, going\rback to the 80\u2019s.\n  So this is well trod ground. What could possibly be added to this soup? I posit\rthat most such discussions center around detail. More interesting is what is\rthe largest fundamental mistake. We should take into account the context of the times\rthat spawned C, and the problems it was trying to solve and the environment\rin which it was intended to be used. Keep in mind it was developed for a 16\rbit machine, with extremely limited resources available.\rI\u2019d like to dismiss things like it doesn\u2019t\rdo garbage collection, functional programming, dynamic typing, or OOP. Those aren\u2019t problems C\rattempted to address, so the lack of them are not mistakes.\n  What mistake has caused more grief, more bugs, more workarounds, more endless hours\rconsumed, etc., than any other? Many people would say\r null pointers.\rI don\u2019t agree.\n    I don\u2019t mean them using the same syntax, or the implicit conversion of\rarrays to pointers. I mean the inability to pass an array to a function\ras an array, even if it is declared to be an array. C will silently convert\rthe array to be a pointer, and will rewrite the function declaration\rso it is semantically a pointer:\n        This seemingly innocuous convenience feature is the root of endless evil.\rIt means that once arrays leave the scope in which they are defined,\rthey become pointers, and lose the information which gives the extent\rof the array \u2014 the array dimension. What are the consequences of losing\rthis information?\n  An alternative must be used. For strings, it\u2019s the whole reason for the 0 terminator.\rFor\rother arrays, it is inferred programmatically from the context. Naturally,\revery situation is different, and so an endless array (!) of bugs ensues.\n    The galaxy of C string functions, from the unsafe strcpy() to sprintf() onwards,\ris a direct result. There are various attempts at fixing this, such as the\r Safe C Library.\rThen there are all the buffer overflows, because functions\rhanded a pointer have no\ridea what the limits are, and no array bounds checking is possible.\n  This problem was inherited in toto by C++, which consequently spawned 10+ years\rof attempts to create a usable string class. Even the eventual  std::string result\ris compromised by its need to be compatible with C 0-terminated strings.\rC++ addressed the more general array problem by inventing  std::vector , and\rmany programming guidelines eschew using  T[] style arrays. But the legacy of\rC arrays continues in C++ with the\r unsafe iterator design.\n  The C99 attempted to fix this problem, but the fatal error it made was still\rnot combining the array dimension with the array pointer into one type.\n  But all isn\u2019t lost. C can still be fixed. All it needs is a little new syntax:\n    meaning an array is passed as a so-called \u201cfat pointer\u201d, i.e. a pair consisting of a\rpointer to the start of the array, and a  size_t of the array dimension.\rOf course, this won\u2019t fix any existing code, but it will enable new code to be written\rcorrectly and robustly. Over time, the syntax:\n    can be deprecated by convention and by compilers. Even better, transitioning to the\rnew way can be done by making the declarations binary compatible with older code:\n  #if NEWC\r  extern  void foo( char a[..]);\r#elif C99\r  extern  void foo(size_t dim,  char a[dim]);\r#else\r  extern  void foo(size_t dim,  char *a);\r#endif\n  This change isn\u2019t going to transform C into a modern language with all the shiny\rbells and whistles. It\u2019ll still be C, in spirit as well as practice. It will\rjust relieve C programmers of dealing with one particular constant, pernicious source of\rbugs.\n    The relevant text from K+R\u2019s The C Programming Language 5.3 is\r\u201cWhen an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the\rlocation of the beginning of the array. Within the called function,\rthis argument is a variable, just like any other variable, and so an\rarray name argument is truly a pointer, that is, a variable containing\ran address.\u201d\n  The relevant text from the C 99 Standard 6.7.5.3.7 is\r\u201cA declaration of a parameter as \u2018array of type\u2019\r\rshall be adjusted to \u2018qualified pointer to type\u2019\r\u201d\n  From Stroupstrup\u2019s The C++ Programming Language first edition 7.1\r\u201cand as usual, array names are converted to pointers.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:12:55", "source_domain":

 ...... ", "note_en": "Maine officials and a California company hired to upgrade the state\u2019s ancient human resources management software are locked in  a multimillion-dollar contract dispute after a months-long standoff over how to complete the long-delayed project. But while the state has claimed the company, Workday, has failed to deliver a workable system, an investigation by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram reveals that a series of problems on the state\u2019s side are largely to blame for the project\u2019s collapse.\n  Inexperienced and poorly qualified people were running the complex project for the state at multiple levels, according to state contractors. Payroll data imported from the old system was faulty. A state manager was accused of harassing both state and Workday personnel. The work environment grew so toxic that project workers would go outside to cry or sit in silence inside their cars, their colleagues said.\n  And when the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services brought in a new project manager to rescue the distressed project, it hired the DAFS commissioner\u2019s husband, a move that was legal under the state nepotism laws but one that government ethics experts say should have been avoided.\n This dysfunctional picture of the state of Maine\u2019s stalled project to introduce a new human resources management software system emerged from an examination by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram into how things went awry, leaving the state\u2019s 12,000 employees relying on an antiquated software system the commissioner herself has described as \u201cbeing held together with duct tape and paper clips.\u201d\n The effort, which has sought to replace a nearly 40-year-old system programmed in an obsolete language only one state employee knows how to use, has spanned two administrations and lead vendors, has missed its deadlines three times, and has resulted in legislative oversight hearings, calls for an investigation by the state\u2019s watchdog agency, and a multimillion-dollar dispute between Workday and the state that\u2019s likely to go to court.\n In the process, the state has spent $34.7 million\u00a0over five years with nothing to show for it, just a partially functional system that hasn\u2019t yet been put online. Kirsten Figueroa, the DAFS commissioner, has blamed Workday for the project\u2019s failure, saying it had \u201cconsistently operated in bad faith and has knowingly misled state officials\u201d in a Feb. 25 letter to the company. Estimated costs to deliver a working system are now expected to total $55 million.\n State officials declined to answer the Press Herald\u2019s questions about the project, citing the potential for litigation. DAFS referred questions to the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which is now handling the contract dispute with Workday, under which DAFS seeks $22 million in refunds and compensation. The Attorney General\u2019s Office declined to comment, answer questions or provide information about the status of the Workday dispute.\n Gov. Janet Mills\u2019 spokesperson said in an email that she would like to see the dispute resolved \u201cin an efficient and timely manner so that the State may move forward in the most cost-effective way with replacing its severely outdated system.\u201d\n  The Press Herald reviewed hundreds of pages of letters, contracts, emails, meeting minutes, reports and presentations about the troubled project provided to the legislative oversight committee or directly to the newspaper, some of which had not previously been made public.\n The newspaper also spoke with three former state contractors who worked on the project, all of whom dispute the commissioner\u2019s characterization of events, telling the Press Herald that the effort was damaged by distracted senior management, shifting requirements from the state, a work environment that turned toxic, and the state\u2019s failure to recruit and hire experienced and qualified personnel to staff the state\u2019s side of the complex implementation effort.\n  Two of the former contractors asked that their names not be published because they fear professional repercussions for speaking out. The exception was Ahmadah Afif, a Maryland-based global training consultant who worked on the Workday Maine project from February 2019 to May 2020.\n Afif, who has helped states, universities and local governments across the country implement Workday and other complex software systems, said the underlying problem became clear soon after she relocated to Augusta and began working on the project.\n \u201cMaine didn\u2019t have the right people in the right places, and the rates they were offering were not going to bring the right expertise to Maine,\u201d Afif said. \u201cIn order to save money, they gave jobs to people with little or no experience. It was like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to drop you in the fire. Dance for me!\u2019\u201d\n Another former state contractor said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us were qualified for the jobs we had. They were quick to hire whoever they could.\u201d\n With DAFS declining to answer most questions for this story, the Press Herald was unable to independently determine the technical qualifications of managers and contractors to execute the demanding implementation.\n There were management problems as well, the contractors said, with inexperienced managers, a lack of attention from the department\u2019s top officials, and, in one case, inappropriate behavior.\n At an appropriations committee hearing March 4, state Rep. Justin Fecteau, R-Augusta, caused  a stir when he said he would not support new funding for the project because he had \u201clearned of probable sexual misconduct in the program directed at the capable women who work there.\u201d\n The Press Herald spoke with a state contractor who said she had been among several victims of sexual harassment by a manager, a state employee, and had filed a complaint with DAFS\u2019 human resources department. The employee said the manager had frequently made offensive comments to and about female state employees and Workday contractors, including references to their menstrual cycles and his desire to be romantically involved with them.\n The human resources department, she said, had recently informed her that its investigation had concluded and that the manager would remain. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one to make a complaint, but somehow he is still in the same post he\u2019s in,\u201d the contractor said, adding that this manager\u2019s behavior damaged staff morale.\n DAFS spokesperson Kelsey Goldsmith confirmed that the investigation \u2013 conducted by outside legal counsel contracted by the Attorney General\u2019s Office \u2013 had found the accusations did \u201cnot meet the legal definition of hostile workplace or harassment of any kind.\u201d\n  The effort to replace the state\u2019s HR management system goes back to 2016, when then-Gov. Paul LePage contracted Infor, a New York firm, to replace it for $13.5 million. That company proved incapable of delivering the promised system, and in November 2018 the LePage administration signed contracts with Workday to provide both the software and an implementation team to work alongside state contractors and staff to get the new system launched by Jan. 1, 2020. The price was $15 million.\n By the time the project got underway in January 2019, Janet Mills was in the Blaine House and Figueroa, a  former colleague of the governor at the Attorney General\u2019s Office, had taken the leadership of DAFS. In the coming months, the state hired contractors to work alongside Workday\u2019s consultants to complete the wide-ranging project, which included customized cloud-based software for payroll, recruitment, time tracking, benefits administration and security.\n   In formal letters later sent to Workday, Figueroa asserted that reports to the department\u2019s Executive Steering Committee \u201cthroughout the project were rosy and optimistic\u201d and that \u201cat no point was the ESC given any indication of the depth and magnitude of the problems.\u201d\n But minutes and presentations from the Executive Steering Committee\u2019s meetings show senior department leaders were well-apprised of the unfolding crisis starting in August 2019, when the group began contemplating pushing the \u201cgo online\u201d deadline from Jan. 1 to March 31, 2020, because of ongoing personnel shortages and testing delays. Minutes from their Aug. 22 meeting \u2013 attended by senior state managers and Workday consultants \u2013 said such a contingency plan had been discussed with the commissioner and had her support.\n The independent auditor Maine hired to evaluate the project, Panorama Government Solutions, completed a report the same day that judged the project to be in \u201cyellow\u201d status overall, warning of tight timelines and fatigue among project staff already working overtime. It warned the project \u201cwill quickly move to Red should something unforeseen arise in Testing or elsewhere on the project that causes delays.\u201d\n \u201cThis feels like the movie \u2018Apollo 13,\u2019\u201d the department\u2019s chief information officer, Fred Brittain, said at a special meeting of the committee on Sept. 13, 2019, referring to the film about how moon-bound astronauts saved themselves through improvised onboard repairs after an explosion damaged their spacecraft. \u201cAre we going to splash down on water or burn down on entry?\u201d\n Thirteen days later, the ESC concluded that the entire project was \u201csignificantly at risk\u201d because of testing problems and other issues. The 15 attendees \u2013 including Brittain, Deputy Commissioner Heather Perreault and at least two Workday consultants \u2013 unanimously recommended moving the deadline, meeting minutes show, though the final decision to do so didn\u2019t come until November.\n   Testing of the payroll portion of the Workday system revealed enormous problems. Figueroa later testified to legislators that the system had a greater than 50 percent \u201cerror rate\u201d but that Workday pressured the state to go ahead with an April 1, 2020, launch all the same.\n A Workday spokesman, Sion Rogers, said via email that neither assertion is accurate. The problem lay not with Workday\u2019s system, which was calculating payroll accurately, but with the data being imported from the state\u2019s existing system, which was filled with errors and inaccuracies. \u201cWorkday did not recommend the State go-live\u201d on April 1, Rogers said. \u201cRather, Workday answered questions and provided guidance to help the State make its decision.\u201d\n The former contractors agreed the payroll problem was with the legacy data for the 12,000 employees covered by the system, a shortcoming also mentioned in several of Panorama\u2019s periodic reports on the project. In essence, the state in many instances hasn\u2019t been calculating pay in accordance with the rules and parameters it provided Workday during the system\u2019s design phase, which resulted in large numbers of variances when the systems were tested side by side.\n \u201cThey wanted the payroll to match the old system, but the old system wasn\u2019t paying people correctly,\u201d one said. \u201cIt uncovered that people were being paid improperly.\u201d\n Afif said the payroll modules of HR management systems are by far the most complex and difficult to execute. Governments have diverse workforces, from police officers to hospital staff to librarians, drivers and boat captains, with different rules, union memberships and requirements. \u201cPayroll is always problematic, no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pull it together if you don\u2019t have experienced people who know how the process works.\u201d\n In Maine\u2019s case, two other former contractors said, the state police had a wide range of small hourly pay differentials based on whether a given officer had spent time working with a K9, wearing scuba gear, or carrying a weapon, which generated a huge number of variances.\n \u201cIn any case, payroll was dead on arrival in early 2020 because of the testing results and needed to be reworked,\u201d one said. \u201cAt that point they could have cut payroll out to work on and rolled out benefits, recruiting, security, time management and the other modules that were ready to go, but they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n  Instead, state officials decided to put the brakes on everything and hire somebody to come in and sort out the mess. That somebody would turn out to be the commissioner\u2019s husband, Doug Birgfeld.\n Birgfeld, who had been working at the Department of Economic and Community Development since shortly after Mills became governor, was hired to resurrect and head DAFS\u2019 Project Management Office, a position he had held for the three and a half years until LePage shut it down in 2016 as part of his  drive to slash the state workforce. The department tasked him with undertaking a strategic review to put the project back on track. He received $114,280 in wages and benefits from this staff position during 2020, state records show.\n  The department says his hiring was legal because officials acted in accordance with  the state\u2019s nepotism rules and laws, which prohibit family members from making the final decision to hire relatives but allow relatives to serve in jobs overseen by them.\n \u201cBirgfeld was selected by (Chief Information Officer) Brittain from a competitive pool of applications for the role of Director and Birgfeld reports directly to Brittain,\u201d DAFS spokesperson Goldsmith said via email. \u201cCommissioner Figueroa was not involved in his hiring.\u201d\n Goldsmith provided a written statement from Brittain in which he said the commissioner wasn\u2019t involved in the process and had proactively alerted him that her husband was applying and \u201cthat she did not want to be involved or consulted in any way.\u201d Brittain said he chose Birgfeld from a field of \u201cthree well-qualified finalists.\u201d\n Scott H. Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a government ethics group in Washington, D.C., said such hires are still problematic.\n \u201cAny situation in which a senior official is overseeing their spouse is a recipe for waste and abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat scenario should be avoided and appropriate screening should take place. These ethics dilemmas are easy to avoid, and another qualified candidate should have been hired.\u201d\n Asked about Birgfeld\u2019s hiring, the governor\u2019s press secretary, Lindsay Crete, said via email that the administration adheres to state laws governing the hiring of family relations and \u201cfocuses on hiring the best, most qualified individuals for jobs throughout State government as required by Maine\u2019s Civil Service law.\u201d\n As Birgfeld began his review in March 2020, Panorama issued a new report warning that his intended plan to come up with a revised workplan and launch date by the end of that month was unrealistic and that if he undertook significant changes it would likely have an adverse impact on the team\u2019s productivity and morale, and that some were scheduled to move to other projects in May.\n The former contractors said morale was already flagging. \u201cPeople were leaving the building crying and others would storm out cursing and get in their car and sit there for an hour,\u201d one said. With the project at a standstill, contractors started being let go.\n When the coronavirus pandemic reached Maine in March 2020, state government went into lockdown, and DAFS became the lead agency in ensuring state buildings and employees had personal protective equipment, Plexiglas partitions, remote computer access and all the other things required to keep essential operations going.\n What went wrong in the 10 months that followed remains unclear, with the state and Workday offering fragmentary and contradictory assessments. Workday withdrew its consultants on short warning in May 2020, alarming department leaders, but then replaced them. Birgfeld developed measures meant to improve the state\u2019s governance of the stalled project but complained about a lack of \u201cday-to-day tactical support\u201d from the Workday consultants. The state and Workday went back and forth for months about whether the latter would receive additional consulting fees, with at least 42 proposals exchanged between them.\n  In September the parties appeared to try to reset their relationship and get the system implemented, but they disagreed over whether Workday should be paid for the additional work. The state hired IJA Strategies, a firm that implements Workday systems for clients, to conduct another independent assessment that detailed longstanding problems, almost all of them involving the state\u2019s side of the ledger.\n The problems IJA identified in its November 2020 report included the state frequently changing plans, deadlines, and configurations \u201cas new staff review previous design decisions\u201d; fatigue, turnover and loss of motivation among project staff; disagreements among state agencies over how statewide payroll rules should be interpreted; and bad data being loaded into the new systems from the old one, ensuring errors and delays.\n This assessment, Workday\u2019s Rogers said via email, highlighted issues the company had been raising with the state for many months. \u201cAny technology deployment is nuanced and requires both parties \u2013 the customer and vendor \u2013 to complete certain requirements on their end in order to be successful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn the customer side this can include project staffing, clear business and functional requirements, and data quality, among others.\u201d\n Workday says it sought to engage the department\u2019s leaders this winter in finding a path forward but were continually rebuffed, denied access to weekly status report meetings and stopped being included in Executive Steering Committee meetings.\n \u201cThere has been no discussion around the major issues that have been hindering project success such as poor data quality, resource turnover challenges, and incomplete/changing requirements due to policy interpretation, amongst other issues,\u201d Workday\u2019s senior vice president for implementation services, Christopher Curtis, wrote Deputy Commissioner Perreault on Feb. 11. \u201cAttempts to engage with the State of Maine teams are often met with resistance, deflection, defensiveness and other tactics.\u201d\n Curtis said Workday\u2019s consultants were now \u201crelegated to a staff augmentation or ad-hoc consulting role\u201d with no real partnership or collaboration with their state counterparts. As a result, he said he was pulling them from the project Feb. 12 until the department decided if it was committed to act on addressing the problems identified in the IJA report.\n Perreault responded that the state would take its time determining how to move forward with the failed project, would share its decision when it came to it, and considered Workday to have been pervasively \u201cacting in bad faith.\u201d She said that if Workday\u2019s consultants paused work, the state would consider the company to be in default of its contract.\n Two weeks later, Figueroa put Workday on notice that it was being fired as implementation partner as of March 9. The state, which has paid Workday about $7.5 million to date, is seeking $22 million from the company, including compensation for having to keep the legacy system going. Workday rejects the claim, and the matter has been turned over to the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n In March, Rep. Fecteau asked for the Legislature\u2019s watchdog agency, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, to launch a formal investigation of the project. The government oversight committee, which must approve such a request, held a hearing April 9 where Figueroa gave her testimony, but has decided not to act until after the state resolves its $22 million dispute with the company.\n \u201cOPEGA investigations require considerable resources from the agency or department involved,\u201d the House chair of the committee, Rep. Genevieve McDonald, D-Stonington, said via email. \u201cThere was bipartisan agreement among members of the Government Oversight Committee to keep Workday on our unfinished business list pending the outcome of settlement agreements.\u201d\n DAFS has put forward a number of specific grievances against Workday that it says amount to a breach of contract, including an alleged failure to produce certain features relating to labor cost distribution and the creation o\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:12:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,failure,\u56fd\u5bb6", "title": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\uff1a\u7f05\u56e0\u5185\u76843500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7194\u70b9 ", "title_en": "System failure: Inside Maine\u2019s $35M human resources software meltdown", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.pressherald.com/2021/06/20/system-failure-inside-maines-35-million-human-resources-software-meltdown/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "failure", "\u56fd\u5bb6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "923de1516460f142ad382060d92b865d.jpg", "infoid": 1067040, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Prolog\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u96be\u9898\u3002 \u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u768418\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Prolog\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d....
