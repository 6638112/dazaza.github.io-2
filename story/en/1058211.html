Police Chief James Craig later apologized for what he called “shoddy” investigative work. Williams, who said he had been driving home from work when the 2018 theft had occurred, was interrogated by detectives and held in custody for 30 hours before his release.</p><p> 检察官在不到两周后丢弃了这个案子，争论官员依赖的证据不足。警方詹姆斯克雷格酋长后来为他所谓的“伪造”调查工作道歉。威廉姆斯表示，当2018年盗窃已经发生时，他一直在上班开车回家，被侦探审查并在他发布前30小时举行监管。</p><p>   Williams’s case sparked a public outcry about the fast-growing police use of a technology that  research has shown often misidentifies people of color. His lawsuit is at least the third in the United States brought by Black men to raise doubts about the software’s accuracy.</p><p>   威廉姆斯的案件引发了关于快速增长的警察使用技术的公开屈服，这些技术的研究已经证明了经常被误区的彩色。他的诉讼至少是美国的第三位，黑人带来了对软件的准确性提出怀疑。</p><p> The case could heighten the legal challenges for a technology that is largely unregulated in the country, even as it has become a prolific investigative tool used by police forces and federal investigators. While the software has been banned by more than a dozen cities nationwide, it has been cited in a growing number of criminal cases, including in the  landmark investigation of rioters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.</p><p> 案件可以提高在该国在基本上不受管制的技术的法律挑战，即使它已成为警察部队和联邦调查人员使用的多产调查工具。虽然该软件被全国多个城市禁止，但它被引用在越来越多的刑事案件中，包括在1月6日在美国国会大厦对骚乱者调查。</p><p>  Williams’s attorneys did not make him available for comment Tuesday. But Williams  wrote in The Washington Post last year that the episode had left him deeply shaken, in part because his young daughters had watched him get handcuffed in his driveway and put into a police car after returning home from work.</p><p>  威廉姆斯的律师并没有让他在周二提供评论。但是，威廉姆斯去年在华盛顿邮报写道，这一集中留下了深深地摇摇欲坠，部分原因是他的年轻女儿已经看着他在车道上戴上手铐，并在下班回家后进入警车。</p><p>   “How does one explain to two little girls that a computer got it wrong, but the police listened to it anyway?” he wrote. “As any other black man would be, I had to consider what could happen if I asked too many questions or displayed my anger openly — even though I knew I had done nothing wrong.”</p><p>   “一个人如何向两个小女孩解释一下电脑弄错了，但是警方无论如何都听取了吗？”他写了。 “就像任何其他黑人一样，如果我问过多的问题或公开展示我的愤怒，我不得不考虑可能发生的事情 - 尽管我知道我做错了什么。” </p><p> Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a Detroit police spokeswoman, said the department does not comment on pending litigation. But she pointed to comments from Craig last year in which the police chief said the case’s failures “had nothing to do with technology, but certainly had everything to do with poor investigative work.”</p><p>SGT。底特律警察发言人妮可柯克伍德表示，该部门对待诉讼不发表评论。但她指出了克雷格去年的评论，警察主席说案件的失败“与技术无关，但肯定有与贫困的调查工作有关。”</p><p> “This was clearly sloppy, sloppy investigative work. There’s no other way for me to say it but that way,” Craig told a Detroit Board of Police Commissioners meeting last June that is cited in the lawsuit. “If you just rely solely on facial recognition technology, there’s a high probability that it’s going to misidentify.”</p><p> “这显然是邋and，邋spectiative的工作。对我来说，没有别的办法，但这种方式，“克雷格于去年6月谈到了底特律的警察局委员会，这是在诉讼中引用的。 “如果你只是依赖面部识别技术，那么它会误识别很高。”</p><p>  Kirkwood told The Post in a statement last year that the department does not make arrests based solely on a facial recognition search and that, in Williams’s case, investigators had reviewed video, interviewed witnesses, conducted a photo lineup and submitted evidence to prosecutors, who recommended charges against Williams for first-degree retail fraud.</p><p>  柯克伍德去年在一份声明中告诉邮政，该部门不会仅仅基于面部认可搜索逮捕，而在威廉姆斯的案例中，调查人员审查了视频，采访的目击者，为推荐的检察官提交了证据对威廉姆斯的收取一级零售欺诈。</p><p>   Wayne County prosecutors later said the facial recognition result was not enough evidence to bring charges and that the store security official shown the photo lineup hadn’t been in the store during the crime.</p><p>   韦恩县检察官后来表示，面部识别结果并没有足够的证据来带来收费，并且店铺阵容的商店安全官员在犯罪期间没有进入商店。</p><p> “This case should not have been issued based on the DPD investigation, and for that we apologize,” prosecutor Kym L. Worthy said in a  statement. “Thankfully, it was dismissed on our office’s own motion. This does not in any way make up for the hours that Mr. Williams spent in jail.”</p><p> “这一案子不应根据DPD调查发出，因为我们道歉，”检察官Kym L.值得在一份声明中说。 “谢天谢地，我们办公室自己的议案就被驳回了。这不是任何方式弥补威廉姆斯先生在监狱的时间。“</p><p>  Williams’s identification as the thief happened after Detroit detectives sent a blurry, dimly lit image from a surveillance camera to the Michigan State Police, which ran a facial recognition search that pointed to Williams’s old driver’s license photo as a possible match.</p><p>  威廉姆斯在底特律侦探派出模糊后的小偷从监视相机发送到密歇根州警察的小偷发生的小偷的身份证明，这是一个面部识别搜索，该搜索指向威廉姆斯旧驾驶执照照片作为可能的匹配。</p><p>  But the state police’s “investigative lead report” also said, in all capital letters, that the document was not a positive identification or sufficient probable cause for an arrest. The detective nevertheless submitted the photo to prosecutors as evidence to support an arrest warrant.</p><p>  但州警方的“调查牵头报告”还表示，在所有大写字母中，该文件并不是逮捕的积极识别或足够可能的原因。然而，侦探将照片提交给检察官，作为支持逮捕令的证据。 </p><p>  The  civil suit argues that Williams’s rights were violated under the Fourth Amendment, which bans “unreasonable” police searches, as well as a state civil rights law prohibiting racial discrimination. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount for damages as well as policy changes for the Detroit Police Department, which continues to use the software.</p><p>民事诉讼认为，威廉姆斯的权利是根据第四修正案侵犯的权利，该修正案禁止禁止“不合理”的警察搜查，以及禁止种族歧视的国家民权法。该诉讼寻求未指明的赔偿金额以及底特律警察局的政策变更，该部门继续使用该软件。</p><p>  Williams is being represented by student attorneys at the University of Michigan Law School’s Civil Rights Litigation Initiative as well as lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the advocacy group’s Michigan affiliate.</p><p>  威廉姆斯正在密歇根州法学院大学的民权诉讼倡议以及来自美国公民自由联盟和倡导集团密歇根联盟的律师的学生律师代表。</p><p>  One of the student attorneys, Jeremy Shur, said Tuesday that Williams’s daughters, ages 3 and 7, have been “traumatized” by the incident. “When they see police, they wonder if they’re taking Daddy away,” Shur said.</p><p>  星期二杰里米·斯科斯的学生律师之一，威廉姆斯的女儿们，3和7岁，事件已被“创伤”。 “当他们看到警察时，他们想知道他们是否爸爸走了，”庇伦说。</p><p> The software’s accuracy is heavily dependent on image quality: Blurry, grainy or dark photos often lead to poor results. But even the algorithms used in a facial recognition search can offer a wide range of effectiveness: Several of those tested in  a 2019 federal study were up to 100 times more likely to misidentify the face of a Black or Asian person, compared with a White person.</p><p> 该软件的准确性严重依赖于图像质量：模糊，颗粒状或暗照片经常导致结果不佳。但是，即使是面部识别搜索中使用的算法也可以提供广泛的有效性：与白人相比，2019年联邦研究中测试的几个人可能更可能误定的可能性超过100倍。 。</p><p>  Williams’s lawsuit is the second accusing Detroit police of making a false facial recognition match: In September, a 26-year-old man named Michael Oliver sued the department, saying his false arrest on a 2019 larceny charge led him to lose his job and spend three days in jail.</p><p>  威廉姆斯的诉讼是第二次指责的底特律警察制定虚假面部认可：9月份，一个名叫迈克尔奥利弗的26岁的男子起诉了该部门，称他对2019年的盗窃罪被逮捕导致他失去工作并花钱在监狱里三天。</p><p>  The same detective, Donald Bussa, investigated both Oliver and Williams and is named in both lawsuits. Craig has criticized Bussa’s use of a “blurry” photo and said the department has worked to change the facial recognition policies that led to the arrest.</p><p>  同样的侦探，唐纳德Bussa调查了Oliver和Williams，并在两个诉讼中命名。克雷格批评了Bussa的使用“模糊”照片，并表示，该部门曾致力于改变导致逮捕的面部识别政策。</p><p> In a third lawsuit, filed in January, a man named Nijer Parks sued New Jersey police and prosecutors, saying he was held in jail for 10 days after he was falsely accused of stealing from a hotel gift shop in 2019. All three cases are ongoing.</p><p> 在第三次诉讼中，1月份提交的一个名为Nijer Parks的人起诉了新泽西州警察和检察官，称他被逮捕10天在2019年被诬告的酒店礼品店被逮捕10天。所有三个案件都在进行中。 </p><p>  Defenders of the technology said it should be used solely to generate leads for police, not as the lone piece of evidence, and that officers should not rely too heavily on its results or apply it to every low-level crime. The Detroit department’s policy has since been changed to allow the use of facial recognition software only in cases of violent crime.</p><p>该技术的捍卫者表示应该仅用于产生警察的领导，而不是作为孤独的证据，而且官员不应该依靠其结果，或将其应用于每个低级犯罪。自底特律部门的政策已被改变，以允许在暴力犯罪情况下使用面部识别软件。</p><p>   But critics argue that officers who put too much trust in the systems’ findings — or who  alter the search images in hopes of achieving better results, as researchers have found evidence of in some police departments — could end up placing the burden of proof on innocent people who may not be told what investigative techniques were used as the basis for their arrest.</p><p>   但批评者认为，作为研究人员在一些警察部门发现的证据表明，批评者在制度'调查结果中提出了太多信任的人员 - 或者将搜索图像改变了搜索型，或者在研究人员中发现了一些警察部门的证据 - 最终可能会让诸如无辜的证据负担可能没有被告知的人被用过哪种调查技巧作为他们被捕的基础。</p><p> Both the Detroit and Michigan state police have a contract with a South Carolina-based company, DataWorks Plus, that makes facial recognition software. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p> 底特律和密歇根州警方都与南卡罗来纳州的公司合同，DataWorks Plus，制作面部识别软件。该公司没有立即回复评论要求。</p><p> The Detroit department is also among hundreds of police agencies that have used Clearview AI, a facial recognition tool that searches through a large database of photos taken from across the Internet, according to a BuzzFeed News report earlier this month based on data from a confidential source. Neither the Detroit police nor Clearview have confirmed the report, and it does not appear Clearview was used in Williams’s case.</p><p> 底特律部门也是几百人士中使用了ClearView AI的警察机构，这是一个面部识别工具，通过来自互联网的大量照片，根据该月的基于机密来源的数据，根据Buzzfeed新闻报告。底特律警察和ClearView都没有确认该报告，并且在威廉姆斯的案例中使用了ClearView。</p><p>  Clare Garvie, a senior associate at Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology who has studied facial recognition software and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the lawsuits have helped shed light on investigative and technological breakdowns that would otherwise remain unseen.</p><p>  Georgetown法律和技术中心高级助理高级助理中心Clare Garvie表示，研究了面部识别软件并没有参与诉讼，表示，该诉讼有助于阐明否则否则仍然看不见的技术崩溃。</p><p>   But she expressed concern that slow court proceedings and a patchwork approach to regulation could lead to more cases of facial recognition misidentification before the existing damage could be addressed.</p><p>   但她表示关切的是，慢异的法院诉讼和监管的拼凑方法可能导致在现有损害可以解决之前的面部认可错误识别。</p><p> Garvie also worried that the cases shifted the costs of police failures to the people who had been falsely identified — and to the general public, who both live in fear of false arrests and end up paying to defend or settle the cases in court.</p><p> Garvie还担心，这些案件将警察失败的成本转移到被错误地确定的人 - 以及向公众担心害怕虚假逮捕，并最终在法庭上支付辩护或解决案件。 </p><p> “There’s the burden of somebody after the fact, who’s already been injured by a misidentification, to inform the public of what happened to them,” she said. Then “the taxpayer bears the burden of the mistake.”</p><p>“事实上，有人的负担，谁已经被误识化受伤，通知公众发生在他们身上的事情，”她说。 然后“纳税人带来了错误的负担。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/13/facial-recognition-false-arrest-lawsuit/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/13/facial-recognition-false-arrest-lawsuit/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/逮捕/">#逮捕</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/arrested/">#arrested</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/警察/">#警察</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
