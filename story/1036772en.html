Now, as he moored his boat to the shaky wooden dock, he heard a familiar and short song that sounded like &#39;oh-sweet-Canada&#39;. The whistle was from a white-throated sparrow calling hopefully for a mate.</p><p>  超过25年的每个夏天，贡瑟（Gonser）和他的妻子伊莱娜·塔特尔（Elaina Tuttle）都去了阿迪朗达克山脉（Adirondack Mountains）的这个野外工作地点，距最近的道路只有45分钟的船程。现在，当他将船停泊在摇摇欲坠的木制码头上时，他听到了一首熟悉的简短歌曲，听起来像是“哦，甜美的加拿大”。哨子是从白喉麻雀传来的，希望有一个伴侣。</p><p>  What he didn&#39;t hear was the voice or laughter of his wife. For the first time, Gonser was at Cranberry Lake alone. Just a few weeks earlier, Tuttle had died of breast cancer.</p><p>  他没有听到的是妻子的声音或笑声。贡瑟第一次独自一人在蔓越莓湖。就在几周前，塔特尔死于乳腺癌。</p><p>  Her entire career, and most of Gonser&#39;s, had been devoted to understanding every aspect of the biology of the white-throated sparrow ( Zonotrichia albicollis). Less than six months before she died this year at the age of 52, the couple and their team published a paper  1 that was the culmination of that work. It explained how a chance genetic mutation had put the species on an extraordinary evolutionary path.</p><p>  她的整个职业生涯以及Gonser的大部分职业都致力于了解白喉麻雀（Zonotrichia albicollis）生物学的各个方面。在她今年52岁去世之前不到六个月，这对夫妇及其团队发表了一篇论文1，这是这项工作的高潮。它解释了遗传突变如何使该物种走上了非同寻常的进化道路。</p><p>  The mutation had flipped a large section of chromosome 2, leaving it unable to pair up with a partner and exchange genetic information. The more than 1,100 genes in the inversion were inherited together as part of a massive &#39;supergene&#39; and eventually drove the evolution of two different &#39;morphs&#39; — subtypes of the bird that are coloured differently, behave differently and mate only with the opposite morph. Tuttle and Gonser&#39;s leap was to show that this process is nearly identical to the early evolution of certain sex chromosomes, including the human X and Y. The researchers realized that they were effectively watching the bird evolve two sex chromosomes, on top of the two it already had.</p><p>  该突变使2号染色体的很大一部分翻转，使其无法与伴侣配对并交换遗传信息。倒置中的1100多个基因作为巨大的“超基因”的一部分被一起遗传，并最终推动了两种不同“变体”的进化-鸟类的亚型颜色不同，行为不同且仅与相反的变体交配。 Tuttle和Gonser的飞跃是表明这一过程与某些性染色体的早期进化几乎相同，包括人类X和Y。研究人员意识到，他们正在有效地观察鸟类进化出两个性染色体，在这两个染色体之上。已经有。</p><p>  “This bird acts like it has four sexes,” says Christopher Balakrishnan, an evolutionary biologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, who worked with Tuttle and Gonser. “One individual can only mate with one-quarter of the population. There are very few sexual systems with more than two sexes.”</p><p>  “这只鸟的行为就像是有四个性别一样，”北卡罗来纳州格林维尔的东卡罗莱纳大学的进化生物学家克里斯托弗·巴拉克里希南说，他曾与塔特尔和冈瑟一起工作。 “一个人只能与四分之一的人口交配。很少有超过两个性别的性系统。”</p><p>  The work helps to explain a long-standing puzzle for biologists. It shows how two identical chromosomes can evolve into distinct subtypes that can define the sexes of a species and their different behaviours. “These birds are an amazing system,” says Catherine Peichel, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Berne. “The process of sex-chromosome evolution tends to erase much of the evidence of how it happened, so being able to watch the process in action is a huge benefit.”</p><p>  这项工作有助于为生物学家解释一个长期存在的难题。它显示了两个相同的染色体如何演变成可以定义物种性别及其不同行为的不同亚型。伯尔尼大学的进化生态学家凯瑟琳·佩切尔（Catherine Peichel）说：“这些鸟是一个了不起的系统。” “性染色体进化的过程往往会抹去很多关于它是如何发生的证据，因此能够观察实际过程是巨大的好处。”</p><p>    What makes Tuttle and Gonser&#39;s project even more unusual is the accumulation of almost 30 years of data, “something that is almost unheard of in biology now”, says Melissa Wilson Sayres, a computational biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe. “Most people tend to jump from project to project.”</p><p>坦佩和亚利桑那州立大学的计算生物学家梅利莎·威尔逊·赛雷斯（Melissa Wilson Sayres）说，使Tuttle和Gonser的项目更加与众不同的是近30年的数据积累，“现在生物学上几乎闻所未闻”。 “大多数人倾向于从一个项目跳到另一个项目。”</p><p>  Gonser is determined to carry on the project. He returned to the field station this summer to continue Tuttle&#39;s legacy and use this drab little garden bird to understand how sex chromosomes may have evolved. “Who knows — there might be many more species that have weird sex chromosomes and we&#39;ve just never bothered to look,” he says.</p><p>  Gonser决心继续进行该项目。他于今年夏天回到野外站，继续Tuttle的遗产，并用这种单调的小花园鸟来了解性染色体是如何进化的。他说：“谁知道-可能会有更多具有奇怪的性染色体的物种，而我们从来没有打扰过它们。”</p><p>    Gonser&#39;s mind moves at a mile a minute, his thoughts racing ahead of his grey Honda Civic. Dressed in basketball shorts and a T-shirt, and sporting days-old stubble, he speeds west on the I-70 interstate towards Indiana State University in Terre Haute, where he and Tuttle shared an office. As ideas tumble out — about new research projects, people to meet, restaurants to avoid — he pauses briefly and apologizes. “Sorry if I&#39;m repeating myself. My brain hasn&#39;t been working right since …” he pauses briefly, and clears his throat, “since Elaina passed.”</p><p>    贡瑟的思维以每分钟一英里的速度移动，他的思想比他的灰色本田思域快。他身着篮球短裤和T恤，运动着数天的茬，他在I-70州际公路上向西行驶，驶向特雷霍特（Terre Haute）的印第安纳州立大学，在那里他与塔特尔（Tuttle）共用了一个办公室。随着新想法的涌现（关于新的研究项目，需要见的人，需要避开的餐馆），他短暂地停顿并道歉。 “抱歉，如果我要重复自己。自从……以来，我的大脑一直无法正常工作。”他短暂地停下来，清了清嗓子，“自从Elaina过去以来。”</p><p>  Tuttle and Gonser first met in 1991 at the State University of New York at Albany, where both were pursuing PhDs in ecology. Gonser was investigating the Puerto Rican frog  Eleutherodactylus coqui and Tuttle was studying fish ecology at New York&#39;s Finger Lakes. Long months in the field suited her love for the natural world, and it was there that she got to know the curious lifestyle of the white-throated sparrow.</p><p>  Tuttle和Gonser于1991年在纽约州立大学奥尔巴尼分校首次会面，他们俩都在这里攻读生态学博士学位。贡瑟（Gonser）正在研究波多黎各人的青蛙Eleutherodactylus coqui，而塔特尔（Tuttle）正在纽约的手指湖研究鱼类生态学。在田野里度过了漫长的几个月，这适合她对自然世界的热爱，在那儿，她开始了解白喉麻雀的好奇生活方式。</p><p>  The bird is relatively common in gardens across the eastern half of North America — and on first glance it is rather plain. All the birds have mostly tan and grey plumage, except for a patch of white under the chin and a bright pop of yellow between the eyes and beak. But closer scrutiny reveals the two types: some have white stripes on their heads, and some have tan stripes. And, as bird spotters and naturalists have long known, the two morphs behave in different ways.</p><p>  该鸟在北美东半部的花园中相对常见-乍一看它很平淡。除了下巴下的白色斑点以及双眼和喙之间的黄色明亮斑点外，所有鸟类均具有棕褐色和灰色的羽毛。但是仔细检查就会发现这两种类型：有些头上有白色条纹，有些头上有棕褐色条纹。而且，就像鸟类发现者和博物学家早就知道的那样，这两种变体的行为方式不同。</p><p>  The tan-striped birds are poor at singing, monogamous and fiercely protect their hatchlings from predators such as raccoons and snakes. The white-striped ones are aggressive, promiscuous, more cavalier about their offspring, and tuneful: Gonser says that they produce a more operatic refrain of oh-sweet-Canada. White-striped birds seem to mate only with tan-striped ones — a relatively unusual phenomenon called disassortative mating (see &#39;Opposites attract&#39;). Tuttle became interested; why do the two morphs behave in this way?</p><p>  棕褐色条纹的鸟不善唱歌，一夫一妻制，并且强烈地保护其幼虫免受浣熊和蛇等掠食者的侵害。白条纹的那些好斗，混杂，对他们的后代更加勇敢，好听：贡瑟说，它们对加拿大甜味的影响更大。白条纹的鸟似乎只与棕褐色的鸟交配-这是一种相对不寻常的现象，称为杂合交配（请参阅“相反吸引”）。塔特尔开始产生兴趣。为什么两个变体以这种方式表现？</p><p>    The literature already contained a huge clue. In 1966, ornithologist H. B. Thorneycroft published a paper in  Science  2 pointing out the bird&#39;s unusual chromosome pair. Tan birds carry two identical copies of chromosome 2, but in white birds, one copy contains an inversion. It&#39;s as if someone had taken a pair of scissors, snipped out most of the chromosome and placed the DNA back in reverse. A chromosomal inversion this large was rare in vertebrates, Thorneycraft noted. It looked like disassortative mating maintained the two morphs in equal proportions in the population, because Mendelian inheritance ensures that, on average, half the offspring of a white–tan pair will inherit the inverted version of chromosome 2. But it would take more work to prove that this was true.</p><p>    文学已经包含了巨大的线索。 1966年，鸟类学家H. B. Thorneycroft在《科学2》上发表了一篇论文，指出了这只鸟的不寻常染色体对。棕褐色的鸟带有两个相同的2号染色体副本，但在白鸟中，一个副本包含一个倒位。好像有人拿了一把剪刀，剪掉了大部分染色体，然后将DNA反向放置。 Thorneycraft指出，如此大的染色体倒置在脊椎动物中很少见。看起来像是杂散交配在种群中保持了两个等比例的变体，因为孟德尔遗传确保了平均而言，白棕褐色对的一半后代将继承2号染色体的反向版本。证明这是真的。</p><p>  To Tuttle, it was a fascinating puzzle — a way to shed light on chromosome evolution, as well as the genes underlying social behaviour. In the early 1990s, however, it was too expensive and laborious to find answers by sequencing the bird&#39;s genome. So Tuttle initially focused on collecting more detail about their behaviour, such as how they selected mates and where they built nests. The goal was to understand what might affect offspring survival. She caught and tagged birds, drew blood samples and perfected the art of collecting semen. “Elaina was the best bird masturbator I ever met,” Gonser says.</p><p>对于塔特尔来说，这是一个令人着迷的难题-一种阐明染色体进化以及社会行为基础基因的方法。然而，在1990年代初期，通过对鸟类的基因组测序来寻找答案太昂贵且费力。因此，Tuttle最初专注于收集有关其行为的更多细节，例如他们如何选择伴侣以及在何处筑巢。目的是了解什么可能影响后代的生存。她捕捉并标记了鸟类，抽取了血液样本，并完善了收集精液的艺术。 “埃琳娜是我见过的最好的鸟类手淫者，”贡瑟说。</p><p>  Gonser soon became drawn into the work. (The couple married in 1994.) After the birth of their son Caleb in 2000, the family began spending summers at Cranberry Lake, and they slowly learnt more about the sparrow. For a 2003 paper  3, Tuttle used genetic analysis of nestlings to quantify the different reproductive strategies of the two morphs. She showed that nearly one-third of the offspring fathered by white-striped males were not born to females with whom they shared a nest. Tan males, by contrast, spent less of their energy finding extra partners and more time guarding their own, so they were more likely to have fathered the chicks they were raising. Although the two morphs went about reproduction in very different ways, both achieved equal reproductive success.</p><p>  贡瑟很快就被这项工作吸引了。 （这对夫妇于1994年结婚。）他们的儿子Caleb在2000年出生后，一家人开始在Cranberry Lake度过夏天，他们慢慢了解了更多关于麻雀的知识。在2003年的论文3中，塔特尔使用雏鸟的遗传分析来量化这两种变体的不同繁殖策略。她表明，由白色条纹的雄性父亲所生的后代中，有近三分之一并非由与之共享巢穴的雌性所生。相比之下，棕褐色的雄性则花费更少的精力寻找更多的伴侣，并花费更多的时间来保护自己的伴侣，因此他们更有可能育出自己饲养的小鸡。尽管两种形态以非常不同的方式进行繁殖，但两者均取得了相同的繁殖成功。</p><p>  Six years later, the team secured a grant from the US National Institutes of Health to start genetic analyses. They mapped chromosome 2 in detail  4 and found that the changes were not a single inversion as Thorneycroft had indicated, but actually a series of inversions within inversions that scrambled the order of genes. They identified several genes that seemed to be associated with feather colour and behaviour, and that might explain the differences between the two morphs. “It&#39;s really, really rare to find such a direct relationship between a set of genes and behaviours. That&#39;s what makes these birds so interesting to study,” says Donna Maney, a neuroendocrinologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who uses the white-throated sparrow as a model to understand how hormones affect the brain.</p><p>  六年后，该研究小组获得了美国国立卫生研究院的资助，开始进行基因分析。他们详细绘制了2号染色体的图谱，发现这些变化并非如Thorneycroft所指出的那样是一个单一的反转，而是实际上是在反转中扰乱了基因顺序的一系列反转。他们鉴定了几种似乎与羽毛颜色和行为有关的基因，这可能解释了这两种形态之间的差异。 “在一组基因和行为之间发现如此直接的联系真的非常罕见。这就是让这些鸟变得如此有趣的原因。”佐治亚州亚特兰大市埃默里大学的神经内分泌学家Donna Maney说，他使用白喉麻雀作为模型来了解激素如何影响大脑。</p><p>  But then, in 2011, just as Tuttle and Gonser were ramping up their genome sequencing, a routine mammogram revealed a lump in one of Tuttle&#39;s breasts. A biopsy confirmed that it was invasive cancer. The couple was shocked — their son was only 11 — but a mastectomy and the drug tamoxifen seemed to contain the disease. Determined not to let the cancer control her life, Tuttle pressed on with her work.</p><p>  但是随后，在2011年，就在塔特尔（Tuttle）和贡瑟（Gonser）加快他们的基因组测序工作时，常规的乳房X线照片显示塔特尔（Tuttle）的一个乳房有肿块。活检证实它是浸润性癌症。这对夫妇感到震惊-他们的儿子只有11岁-但乳房切除术和他莫昔芬药物似乎包含了这种疾病。为了不让癌症控制她的生活，塔特尔继续她的工作。</p><p>      By this point, the researchers had come up with the concept that the birds were evolving a second set of sex chromosomes. “It&#39;s a bizarre idea, but it just makes sense from the data,” said Alan Bergland, a geneticist who studies the molecular basis of evolutionary adaptation at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. No other species was known to have one set of fully operational sex chromosomes and another pair that subdivided the species again on another aspect of mate choice.</p><p>      至此，研究人员提出了鸟类正在进化第二套性染色体的概念。遗传学家艾伦·伯格兰德（Alan Bergland）说：“这是一个奇怪的想法，但是从数据上讲才有意义。”他在夏洛茨维尔的弗吉尼亚大学研究进化适应的分子基础。尚无其他物种具有一套完全可操作的性染色体，而另一对物种又在配偶选择的另一个方面将其再细分。</p><p>  Evolution has led to many weird and wonderful sexes and means of determining them. Some animals, such as reptiles, have two sexes and no sex chromosomes, whereas the freshwater protozoan  Tetrahymena thermophila  has seven sexes, each of which can mate with any type except its own. Two sexes with one set of sex chromosomes is the most common arrangement, and has evolved independently many times. But there&#39;s no reason a species can&#39;t have more sex chromosomes, Wilson Sayres says. “If you&#39;ve got two genes linked together that can&#39;t cross over during meiosis, and one of them plays a role in sex determination, suddenly you can have a new sex chromosome.”</p><p>  进化导致了许多奇怪而美好的性别以及确定它们的手段。有些动物（例如爬行动物）具有两种性别，并且没有性染色体，而淡水原生动物嗜热四膜虫具有七种性别，每种类型都可以与自己的任何一种交配。带有一组性染色体的两种性别是最常见的排列方式，并且已经独立进化了许多次。威尔逊·塞雷斯说，但是没有理由没有一个物种拥有更多的性染色体。 “如果您有两个连接在一起的基因在减数分裂期间无法交叉，并且其中一个在性别决定中起作用，那么突然间您可以拥有一个新的性染色体。”</p><p>  Researchers believe that the X and Y chromosomes in many mammals, and the W and Z in birds, emerged from a major inversion on a normal pair of chromosomes that prevented them from swapping genetic material, or &#39;crossing over&#39;. The suite of genes in the inversion was cemented together as a supergene that was inherited in one large chunk. On both the Y and Z chromosomes, the inversion shifted the location of a gene that determined male or female sexual development, respectively (male birds are ZZ and females are ZW). Over time, the Y and Z chromosomes accumulated mutations, because  crossing over wasn&#39;t weeding them out. But, because all this happened in the distant evolutionary past, scientists had struggled to identify the precise steps involved.</p><p>  研究人员认为，许多哺乳动物的X和Y染色体，以及鸟类的W和Z染色体，是由于正常一对染色体发生了重大反转而导致它们无法交换遗传物质或“交叉”。倒置中的基因组被巩固在一起，成为一个大块遗传的超基因。在Y和Z染色体上，倒置均改变了确定雄性或雌性性发育的基因的位置（雄鸟为ZZ，雌鸟为ZW）。随着时间的流逝，Y和Z染色体积累了突变，因为交叉并没有消除它们。但是，由于所有这些都是在遥远的进化历史中发生的，因此科学家们一直在努力寻找所涉及的精确步骤。</p><p>  The sparrows offered such a chance. The inversion on chromosome 2 doesn&#39;t include genes that determine sexual development — but it does contain some that affect the birds&#39; reproductive behaviour. Over time, those genes diverged and drove the different characteristics of the two morphs. “Whatever genes control these behavioural differences will ultimately be traced back to this inversion,” says Maney.</p><p>麻雀提供了这样的机会。 2号染色体上的倒位不包括决定性发育的基因，但是它确实包含一些会影响鸟类繁殖行为的基因。随着时间的流逝，这些基因发散并驱动了两种形态的不同特征。 “无论哪种基因控制这些行为差异，最终都可以追溯到这种倒置，” Maney说。</p><p>    But to truly show that chromosome 2 was evolving like a sex chromosome, Tuttle and Gonser would need to demonstrate that the genes in the inversion were acquiring mutations much faster than those on other chromosomes. This would prove that the white and tan morphs were using true disassortative mating, so that all pairs were white–tan. Even a tiny percentage of white–white matings would allow the inverted chromosome 2 to undergo crossing over that would help to cleanse it of mutations, and undermine the idea that it was acting like a sex chromosome. Tuttle and Gonser would need to sequence the genomes of many birds, to show parentage and to compare mutation rates in the inversion with the rest of the genome.</p><p>    但是要真正表明2号染色体正在像性染色体一样进化，Tuttle和Gonser需要证明倒置中的基因获得突变的速度比其他染色体上的突变快得多。这将证明白色和棕褐色的变体正在使用真正的分解交配，因此所有配对都是白色棕褐色的。甚至很小比例的白-白交配也会使倒转的2号染色体越过，这将有助于清除其突变，并破坏了它像性染色体那样的观念。 Tuttle和Gonser将需要对许多鸟类的基因组进行测序，以显示亲缘关系，并将倒置中的突变率与其他基因组进行比较。</p><p>  Finding DNA to sequence was easy. By now, Tuttle had several freezers full of blood samples collected over the years from thousands of birds. But other biology was getting in the way.</p><p>  找到DNA进行测序很容易。到现在为止，塔特尔（Tuttle）拥有数台冷冻机，这些冷冻机多年来已从数千只鸟身上收集了血液样本。但是其他生物学正在阻碍。</p><p>  In autumn 2013, a chronic cough sent Tuttle back to the doctor with what she thought was bronchitis. She learned that her cancer had returned and spread to her lungs. Genome sequencing of her tumour revealed that her original cancer was a mosaic of cell types; the tamoxifen had tamed the hormone-sensitive cancer cells, but the insensitive ones had survived. She underwent more chemotherapy, which held the cancer in check.</p><p>  2013年秋天，由于慢性咳嗽，塔特尔以其认为是支气管炎的病情回到了医生手中。她得知自己的癌症已经复发并扩散到了肺部。她的肿瘤的基因组测序表明她的原始癌症是细胞类型的镶嵌。他莫昔芬已经驯服了激素敏感性癌细胞，但不敏感的癌细胞得以幸存。她接受了更多的化疗，从而控制了癌症。</p><p>    By the summer of 2015, the team had gathered both the ecological and the genetic data that they needed and were putting the finishing touches to their big paper — when a routine scan revealed that Tuttle&#39;s tumours were growing again. Tuttle made the 13-hour drive from Terre Haute to Cranberry Lake between chemo treatments. “We knew she was sick, but we didn&#39;t realize just how sick she really was,” says graduate student Lindsay Forrette. Soon, Tuttle was getting increasingly grim predictions about how much time she had left. “We were all thinking she was going to beat the cancer, and when we finally understood she wasn&#39;t …” Gonser&#39;s voice trails off. When Tuttle realized she would never return to Cranberry Lake, she broke down and cried.</p><p>    到2015年夏天，研究小组已经收集了他们所需的生态和遗传数据，并在大篇幅上作了画龙点睛—例行扫描显示，塔特尔的肿瘤又在生长。在进行化学疗法之间，塔特尔（Tuttle）从Terre Haute到蔓越莓湖（Cranberry Lake）有13小时的车程。研究生Lindsay Forrette说：“我们知道她生病了，但我们没有意识到她真的有病。”很快，塔特尔对她离开了多少时间的预测越来越严峻。 “我们都以为她将战胜癌症，而当我们最终了解到她不是……” Gonser的声音逐渐减弱。当塔特尔意识到自己永远不会回到蔓越莓湖时，她崩溃了，哭了起来。</p><p>  In January 2016, when the paper was published in  Current Biology, it showed unequivocally that chromosome 2 was evolving like a sex chromosome. White–white and tan–tan matings were exceedingly rare. Using the whole-genome sequences of 50 birds, the team demonstrated that the genes in the inversion were acquiring mutations much more quickly than elsewhere in the genome, a pattern that echoed the evolution of sex chromosomes in humans and birds.</p><p>  2016年1月，当该论文发表在《现代生物学》上时，它明确表明2号染色体正在像性染色体一样进化。白白色和棕褐色的交配非常罕见。研究小组利用50只鸟类的全基因组序列，证明了倒置中的基因比基因组中其他任何地方更快地获取突变，这一模式呼应了人类和鸟类中性染色体的进化。</p><p>  In a press release, Tuttle said: “This is probably my pinnacle paper.” It would also be her last. By spring, her health had worsened. Just five days before she died, Tuttle busied herself from her hospital bed, writing more papers and helping graduate students to analyse data. She died on 15 June. When Gonser announced the news, he received condolences from around the world. “Everyone who knew her, loved her. She was just that kind of person,” Gonser says.</p><p>  塔特尔在新闻稿中说：“这可能是我的巅峰之作。”这也是她的最后一次。到了春天，她的健康状况恶化了。就在她去世的前五天，塔特尔（Tuttle）从医院的病床上忙碌起来，写了更多论文，并帮助研究生分析数据。她于6月15日死亡。当贡瑟宣布这一消息时，他受到了世界各地的哀悼。 “认识她的每个人都爱她。她就是那种人。”贡瑟说。</p><p>  Tuttle leaves a rich research legacy that raises further questions, including whether this chromosomal system is ultimately destined to disappear. Balakrishnan says it is unsustainable. “That we never see systems with four sexes says that they&#39;re evolutionarily unstable and one of these alleles will ultimately go extinct.” That&#39;s because in a four-sex system, each bird must work that much harder to find a mate — a white female is not just looking for a male, she needs a tan one — so selection will favour a more advantageous two-sex system instead. Balakrishnan intends to use the white-throated sparrow to further tease apart the genetic and environmental factors that drove its evolution in the first place.</p><p>塔特尔留下了丰富的研究遗产，这引发了进一步的问题，包括这种染色体系统是否最终注定要消失。 Balakrishnan说这是不可持续的。 “我们从未见过具有四个性别的系统说它们在进化上是不稳定的，这些等位基因之一最终将灭绝。”那是因为在四性系统中，每只鸟必须更加努力地寻找伴侣-白人雌性不仅在寻找雄性，还需要棕褐色-因此选择将更有利于更有利的两性性系。 Balakrishnan打算使用白喉麻雀进一步挑逗推动其进化的遗传和环境因素。</p><p>  Gonser will keep going back to Cranberry Lake. He and his group want to better understand which genes control the sparrow&#39;s behaviour — from mate selection to parenting — and how those characteristics were affected by the inversion. They are using digital maps and satellite data to chart nesting sites, track tagged birds and build a richer set of behavioural data.</p><p>  贡瑟将继续返回蔓越莓湖。他和他的团队希望更好地了解哪些基因控制了麻雀的行为-从配偶选择到育儿-以及这些特征如何受到倒置的影响。他们正在使用数字地图和卫星数据来绘制筑巢地点的图表，跟踪标记过的鸟类并建立更丰富的行为数据集。</p><p>  “There&#39;s a lot more information left in these birds,” Gonser says. “And I think Elaina would like that we&#39;re trying to uncover their secrets.”</p><p>  “这些鸟身上还有很多信息，”贡瑟说。 “而且我认为Elaina希望我们试图发现他们的秘密。”</p><p>        For the best commenting experience,  please login or register as a user and agree to our  Community Guidelines.
