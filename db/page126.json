From the perspective of a programmer, SSDs and disks look very similar: both are persistent, enable page-based access through file systems and system calls, and have large capacities.  However, there are also important differences, which become important if one wants to achieve optimal SSD performance. As we will see, SSDs are more complicated and their performance behavior can appear quite mysterious if one simply thinks of them as fast disks. The goal of this post is to provide an understanding of why SSDs behave the way they do, which can help creating software that is capable of exploiting them. (Note that I discuss NAND flash, not Intel Optane memory, which has different characteristics.)\n  SSDs are often referred to as disks, but this is misleading as they store data on semiconductors instead of a mechanical disk. To read or write from a random block, a disk has to mechanically move its head to the right location, which takes on the order of 10ms. A random read from an SSD, in contrast, takes about 100us \u2013 100 times faster. This low read latency is the reason why booting from an SSD is so much faster than booting from a disk.\n  Another important difference between disks and SSDs is that disks have one disk head and perform well only for sequential accesses. SSDs, in contrast, consist of dozens or even hundreds of flash chips (&#34;parallel units&#34;), which can be accessed concurrently.  SSDs transparently stripe larger files across the flash chips at page granularity, and a hardware prefetcher ensures that sequential scans exploit all available flash chips. However, at the flash level there is not much difference between sequential and random reads. Indeed, for most SSDs it is possible to achieve almost the full bandwidth with random page reads as well. To do this, one has to schedule hundreds of random IO requests concurrently in order to keep all flash chips busy. This can be done by starting lots of threads or using asynchronous IO interfaces such as libaio or io_uring.\n  Things get even more interesting with writes. For example, if one looks at write latency, one may measure results as low as 10us \u2013 10 times faster than a read. However, latency only appears so low because SSDs are caching writes on volatile RAM. The actual write latency of NAND flash is about 1ms \u2013 10 times slower than a read. On consumer SSDs, this can be measured by issuing a sync/flush command after the write to ensure that the data is persistent on flash. On most data center/server SSDs, write latency cannot be measured directly: the sync/flush will complete immediately because a battery guarantees persistence of the write cache even in the case of power loss.   To achieve high write bandwidth despite the relatively high write latency, SSDs use the same trick as reads: they access multiple flash chips concurrently. Because the the write cache can asynchronously write pages, it is not even necessary to schedule that many writes simultaneously to get good write performance. However, the write latency cannot always be hidden completely: for example, because a write occupies a flash chip 10 times longer a read, writes cause significant tail latencies for reads to the same flash chip.\n  Our understanding is missing one important fact: NAND flash pages cannot be overwritten. Page writes can only be performed sequentially within blocks that have been erased beforehand. These erase blocks have a size of multiple MB and therefore consist of hundreds of pages. On a new SSD, all blocks are erased, and one can directly start appending new data.  Updating pages, however, is not so easy. It would be too expensive to erase the entire block just to overwrite a single page in-place. Therefore, SSDs perform page updates by writing the new version of the page to a new location. This means that the logical and physical pages addresses are decoupled. A mapping table, which is stored on the SSD, translates logical (software) addresses to physical (flash) locations. This component is also called Flash Translation Layer (FTL).  For example, let&#39;s assume we have a (toy) SSD with 3 erase blocks, each with 4 pages. A sequence of writes to pages P1, P2, P0, P3, P5, P1 may result in the following physical SSD state:\n    Using the mapping table and out-of-place write, everything is good until the SSD runs out of free blocks. The old version of overwritten pages must eventually be reclaimed. If we continue our example from above by writing to pages P3, P4, P7, P1, P6, P2, we get the following situation:    At this point we have no more free erase blocks (even though logically there should still be space). Before one can write another page, the SSD first has to erase a block. In the example, it might be best for the garbage collector to erase block 0, because only one of its pages is still in use. After erasing block 0, we make space for 3 writes and our SSD looks like this:\n  To garbage collect block 0, we had to physically move page P0, even though logically nothing happened with that page. In other words, with flash SSDs the number of physical (flash) writes is generally higher than the number of logical (software) writes. The ratio between the two is called write amplification. In our example, to make space for 3 new pages in block 0, we had to move 1 page. Thus we have 4 physical writes for 3 logical writes, i.e., a write amplification of 1.33.  High write amplification decreases performance and reduces flash lifetime. How large write amplification is depends on the access pattern and how full the SSD is. Large sequential writes have low write amplification, while random writes are the worst case.  Let&#39;s assume our SSD is filled to 50% and we perform random writes. In steady state, wherever we erase a block, about half the pages of that block are still in use and have to be copied on average. Thus, write amplification for a fill factor of 50% is 2. In general, worst-case write amplification for a fill factor f is 1/(1-f):     Because write amplification becomes unreasonably high for fill factors close to 1, most SSDs have hidden spare capacity. This overprovisioning is typically 10-20% of the total capacity. Of course, it is also easy to add more overprovisioning by creating an empty partition and never write to it.\n  SSDs have become quite cheap and they have very high performance. For example, a Samsung PM1733 server SSD costs about 200 EUR per TB and promises close to 7 GB/s read and 4 GB/s write bandwidth. Actually achieving such high performance requires knowing how SSD work and this post described the most important behind-the-scenes mechanisms of flash SSDs.  I tried to keep this post short, which meant that I had to simplify things. To learn more, a good starting point is  this tutorial, which also references some insightful papers. Finally, because SSDs have become so fast, the operating system I/O stack is often the performance bottleneck.

", "note_en": "Note: I\u2019m writing this as a former employee (as of June 2021) of Autodesk. My views are entirely my own, based on my recollections and personal experiences during my time with the company.\n I\u2019ve been working with the  Shotgun team in various capacities for t  he past 7 years, shortly after it was acquired by  Autodesk. The first few months I worked with the team, people would ask me what it was like, and I\u2019d always answer \u201cabsolutely everyone is super-smart, it\u2019s really weird\u201d. Practically everyone who was there back then has now moved onto other things outside of Autodesk, but I stay in touch with many of them and miss working with them all greatly.\n Today I read  this post (warning: the language used in the post is quite strong). It\u2019s the kind of thing no Product Manager wants to read, as it signifies us having failed our users. It made me reflect on how things have changed both in the company and how those changes have manifested in the formerly beloved product itself over the past few years.\n When I started, the feeling within the Shotgun team was one of a startup embedded within a larger corporation. We had a great deal of autonomy, and I spent the first few months blissfully unaware of what most of the rest of Autodesk was doing. We were focused on one thing, and that singular purpose, combined with the fact that most of the team (myself included) had been plucked out of the industry we were now serving, meant that all of us cared deeply about the work we were doing. Customer pain wasn\u2019t a cliche, it was our pain too. I spent months embedded with people trying to use Shotgun to get their film and episodic shows produced, I was there when things went wrong for them and they lost time or got frustrated. Our company mission was to \u201cget people home in time for dinner\u201d and we all knew how important that was. We had seen people work long hours, sacrificing everything for the sake of a single shot in a piece of media (or had been one of those people). We desperately wanted to succeed.\n  Even when I joined seven years ago, much of the technology used in the web-based product was dated, and many of the design patterns and user interactions were archaic or undercooked in a rush to get them out the door. From a certain perspective, this was a good thing\u2013 the product had product-market fit, and arguably a big part of the reason for that was that its development process was optimised for being responsive to the multitude of varying needs of its customers, not in spending time and energy in polishing features that were good enough. One thing I learned about building B2B software, is that every customer needs different things. So if you have customer A who needs something, then you go and build it as quickly as possible, when customer B comes along with a different problem, you are incentivised in the short term to now go and build the thing customer B needs, rather than iterating on the feature you just made for the benefit of some imaginary future customer. Everyone wants to build software that delights, but doing so often means not doing something else, and when you are trying to make people \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cwilling to pay\u201d, as opposed to \u201cdelighted\u201d, something has to give.\n Years of this mindset had created a product that was feature-rich, had incredible retention, even winning an Academy Award, but was falling apart at the seams from product debt. We had reached a point with the product where whenever we tried to build anything new or otherwise update certain aspects of the software, dozens of unrelated things would break. There was limited test coverage across all the code, and conversely a lot of different ways for users to configure their particular experience. It wasn\u2019t that every instance of Shotgun was unique, but it wasn\u2019t far off.\n It was a problem that always seemed incomprehensible to new leadership. Someone would join the team with the ambition to make us go faster, assuming it was down to lack of motivation or willingness to make changes. I referred to  this excellent article often when I was thinking about this situation, and this graph in particular:\n  We were constantly in the red area of the graph. We had tons of data on what we needed to do with the product, debated furiously about what was the most important of all the things to commit our scarce resources to, because doing anything at all would be extremely challenging and costly; and then failed to execute effectively. That though, was not down to any technical hurdles. It was down to an existential issue.\n  Autodesk is a big corporation, albeit one with less than 10,000 employees globally. It\u2019s best known for AutoCAD, though the overall product portfolio probably numbers in the hundreds. Most of what Autodesk does is serve the architectural, construction and manufacturing industries. A tiny portion of its revenue though, comes from media &amp; entertainment, predominantly high-end 3D content creation and rendering (with Shotgun as the product that focuses on the business functions of those processes). No one seems to know, or at least be able to articulate why it maintains its deathgrip (over time it has acquired many of the dominant products in the space) over a vertical that doesn\u2019t materially factor into the company\u2019s bottom line. We would speculate that there\u2019s the sex appeal (such as it is) of big splashy visual effects showreels in stark contrast to photos of people with hardhats and the umpteenth render of a building exterior in corporate marketing materials. Whatever the reason, we constantly felt that the corporate overlords would at some point decide to cut their losses and drop the entire division. That never happened though. Instead we had a string of reorgs and their corresponding shifts in focus.\n Around three years ago our product group was selected to pilot a new \u201cincubation\u201d process within Autodesk. On paper it was a superb idea- you allow a group to effectively function with the same level of autonomy\u2013 and accountability\u2013 as a startup would. Our goals became growth-based, we had targets and if those targets were successfully met then our \u201cfunding\u201d would increase accordingly.\n The problem though, was that no-one on the team actually cared about growth. \u201cGet people home in time for dinner\u201d had to become something more like \u201cget even more people home at some time\u201d. Our growth targets then just became a means to an end: get more users and then we get permission to do the stuff that we actually felt excited by.\n With all of this came a sense of (in retrospect) unjustified optimism. The team was restructured, some development teams were dropped and more senior managers were hired in their place. The idea was to get them in place for when our team would be able to grow. The only thing we needed to figure out was where to find the growth opportunity.\n The high-end visual effects industry that we dominated is notoriously slow to adapt to change, and operates for the most part on razor-thin margins. There were billions flowing into film and episodic production every year, but there wasn\u2019t (and likely still isn\u2019t) an obvious opportunity to further monetise our existing customers. But there were two bets that might make a difference. First, Shotgun was too hard to get up and running for anyone unfamiliar with it (due to us never having paid back the aforementioned product debt). Fixing this might lead to greater adoption. Second, although Shotgun popular with Producers and Coordinators, Artists didn\u2019t get on well with it. It was estimated that in a given company there were many more artists not using Shotgun than there were people already using it and that winning them over would lead to significant growth.\n We organised around going after those two potential opportunities and then almost immediately ran into trouble. I (along with a couple of other product managers) was involved with solving the ease of use problem. What was easy was identifying the roadblocks and them prioritising their importance. Where we came unstuck was in actually trying to implement viable solutions to those problems. Any single problem we tried to address was going to be a multi-month effort with the team we had and the technical challenges we would have to overcome (and again, in retrospect even those estimates seem woefully optimistic). There was also the problem which no-one really wanted to admit, which was we didn\u2019t have experience of building things that were easy to use (fortunately, for me at least, many of the people we hired over the past couple of years  did have that experience, and I learned a lot from them).\n But we tried, thinking we could tackle smaller line items in shorter time spans and build up a sort of momentum. We budgeted work by the quarter, but the first quarter worth of work stretched out to two quarters, then required further work in addressing regressions, then more regressions. My choice each time was between abandoning the work half-finished and try something else, or else seeing things through to completion. I chose the latter option, because we had a long history of leaving things half-finished, and everyone on the team, and our customers, was pretty tired of it. I still don\u2019t know if it was the right one, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the wrong one.\n Meanwhile, the artist opportunity was pursued by building out a new product from the ground up, using a much more modern technology stack than we were used to. It represented the future, but it also meant that many developers who were experienced with Ruby or C++ had to reskill in a very short space of time. It was hard. The product, Shotgun Create, ultimately launched as a vastly superior (in terms of user experience) alternative to Shotgun\u2019s capabilities for reviewing and approving work. But it was hard to get people to actually use it. For a couple of months or so, everyone across the organisation stopped what they were doing to help out on the adoption push. It was a stressful time for many, and when it was over, had left a deep scar on the team.\n Two opposing schools of thought were forming. In one camp, the only way forward was to completely redesign and rebuild Shotgun from scratch, using modern engineering and design. In the other, we had to make incremental changes, minimizing disruption to users above all else. Both approaches had their pros and cons, but the team couldn\u2019t be aligned to one or the other. From leadership down, we oscillated back and forth between each. During this stormy time, the strategy to improve adoption through changes in the product was jettisoned in favour of a focus on Go To Market, and a number of key people departed the company, either through frustration or having been terminated.\n The result of this was that for the first time the majority of employees on the Shotgun team were not native to the media and entertainment industry. Many of them were willing to learn, and had a strong sense of empathy, but it would take time to build the domain knowledge up. Priorities shifted once more, this time to focus on integrating with the Autodesk corporate machinery. It was a sensible approach, as it would remove things that were bespoke to Shotgun without providing any real benefit, such as billing and sales channels, but it carried a massive opportunity cost, with leadership making it the top priority for us, and requiring a lot of work over a number of months for the team without having anything users would actually care about to show for it. More reorgs happened, as if to drive this point home. The \u201cStreet Team\u201d, a support team comprised of extremely smart and knowledgeable former Shotgun experts and workflow specialists, was dissolved, with the general Autodesk support team attempting to fill in. From the perspective of the product team, we pretty much stopped hearing from customers altogether (aside from those we were speaking to directly).\n The incubation process ended, or perhaps fizzled out. Many customers were complaining that their needs were not being met, but there wasn\u2019t capacity to do anything about it (others had since given up complaining, which was in many ways worse). What we were trying to focus our energies on at that point was creating the infrastructure to create new experiences in a piecemeal way that would be decoupled from the problematic technology stack. Our bet was that being able to build in a new environment would allow for experimentation and iteration at a speed expected of a modern software company. It represented our attempt to finally break free of the technical debt that had plagued us for years. It was exciting.\n  I can\u2019t say (both for legal reasons, and because I don\u2019t know) where things are headed for Shotgun going forwards. It has recently been renamed to \u201cShotGrid\u201d in an effort to make it less problematic, as part of the integration work (and needless to say, requiring a lot of work in its own right). I can count the number of people still working on the ShotGrid team who have industry experience on one hand (and the former willingness to learn and empathise seems to have dissipated), a far cry from how it was when I joined. Perhaps that doesn\u2019t matter. Perhaps the remaining ShotGrid team will be able to address the product debt issues and modernise or otherwise improve it for the userbase in a way we were unable to do. More than anything, I hope to read a post from a customer at some point in the future, telling a story about how the product helped them get home in time for dinner.", "posttime": "2021-06-21

", "note_en": "I&#39;m switching to Julia after running this comparison of Julia vs Numpy and Fortran, for performance and code simplicity.\n      Julia is a pretty new language, which, among other things, aims tosolve the so-called  \u201ctwo-language problem\u201d in scientific computing.\n That is, we usually test ideas in a  rapid-prototyping languagelike Matlab or Python, but when the testing is done, and its timeto do some serious computation, we need to rely on a different (compiled)programming language.\n Many tools exist to ease the transition, and  wrapping Fortran librariesinto Python has been my preference so far. For example, wrapping up some Fortran with F2PY seems like a very convenient wayto use (and distribute) efficient Fortran code that anybody can run.I also keep track of various ways of using Fortran in Python in  this post.\n Now,  Julia aims to solve this issue in a radical way. The idea is to usea single programming language, which has both an interactive mode, suitablefor rapid prototyping, but that can also be compiled and executed at C/Fortranperformance.\n     Numpy is restricted to single-threading in many cases, is hard to code and read, and can be much slower than the two alternatives.\n Fortran offers great performance with pretty simple code, but some wrapping is required to call Fortran from high-level languages like Python.\n Julia is faster and easier to write than Numpy and is even able to beat gfortran\u2019s performance.\n Honestly, I was shocked by what I found in my performance comparison.Julia is amazing.  I didn\u2019t expect Julia would beat gfortran with compiler optimizations in my test.And it currently does so  by a lofty margin.\n  Opinions on code readability are, of course, subjective, but I want to explainwhy I think  Numpy offers the worst quality experience.\n So far, interpreted languages have required manual re-writing of loops as vector operations.With some practice, this becomes and easy task, but after having done so extensively for many years (first in Matlab, then in Python),I came to the conclusion that  I hate to manually vectorize code. I prefer to write for loops and have the compiler vectorize them for me!\n   Can you tell what it does, at first sight? Can you reason about the code\u2019s performance?Can you even guess the dimension of the output M?\n Now, here is a nested for loop which does the same as the above code.\n    No wonder why they named Fortran \u201cFORmula TRANslator\u201d in the first place.Interestingly, the Julia syntax is exactly similar in this regard.\n So even though I agree with the idea than Python is a beautiful language to work with,I don\u2019t think the same holds for Numpy. Yes, Numpy allows us to stay within a Python framework and get things donewith simple one-liners (which is pretty neat anyway) but the resulting Numpycode becomes hard to read afterward.\n  I believe there is no such thing as a definitive benchmark. Running a seriesof completely unrelated tests of toy problems, and claiming that a certain languageis overall the best because it does well in most of the tests,is meaningless if we are interested in certain specific and more realisticcases.\n Rather than trying to rely on big, all-purpose benchmarks, I believe it is preferable to run,from time to time, some micro-benchmarks suited to our own projects.\n If we can predict what the major performance bottlenecks of our code will be,major performance bottleneck of our codeWe can then come up with a minimalistic, but spot-on example, and create a specific performancetest that suits our needs.\n In my numerical projects, for example, I do a lot of array operations and I evaluate a lot of complex exponentials.So that\u2019s why this test is about just that. My benchmark was already described above,it\u2019s just: given a vector a, form the matrix\n   All tests were run in an Intel i7-4700MQ CPU (3.40 GHz, 6MB of Cache)with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM\n   function eval_exp(N) a = range(0, stop=2*pi, length=N) A = Matrix{ComplexF64}(undef, N, N) @inbounds  [email\u00a0protected] for j in 1:N for i in 1:N A[i,j] = exp((100+im)*im*sqrt(a[i]^2 + a[j]^2)) end end return Aendeval_exp(5)print(string(&#34;running loop on &#34;, Threads.nthreads(), &#34; threads \\n&#34;))for N in 1000:1000:10000 @time begin A = eval_exp(N) endend\n   note: ST and MT stand for single-threaded and multithreaded,respectively. Note that in all cases, the fast-math optimization flag was used, which allows compilers to reorder mathematical expressions to obtain accuracy, but in a way that could break IEEE compliance.\n  Interestingly, from the above table, we can compute the threading efficiency,that is, the speed-up factor when moving from single to multithreading.\n  In a quad-core CPU, Julia\u2019s Multithreading efficiency is about 4.9,whereas when relying on gfortran and OpenMP, we get about 3.6. So Julia is effectively taking advantage of hyperthreading, somethingwhich is rarely seen in OpenMP.\n    It turns out that Julia has further tools to increase performance. One of such toolsis LoopVectorization.jl\n As suggested by Mason in  this topicof the JuliaLang forum, at least the single-threaded version can besped up quite significantly by resorting to that library.\n I\u2019ll continue to dig deeper on how to skeeze the last bit of performanceout of computer hardware by resorting to Julia. Stay tuned!\n  Why is Fortran still used. I had a fair degree of experience with Fortran, and I believe there are solid reasons to use Fortran for scientific computing today.\n Will Julia Replace Fortran in HPC?. However, afeter comparing Fortran with Julia on various grounds, I tend to think that, over time, Julia seems on track to superseed Fortran, even in the HPC niche.\n I&#39;m Martin D.

the history of life took place. A primitive bacterium was engulfed by our oldest ancestor \u2014 a solo, free-floating cell. The two fused to form a mutually beneficial relationship that has lasted more than a billion years, with the latter providing a safe, comfortable home and the former becoming a powerhouse, fueling the processes necessary to maintain life.\n  That\u2019s the best hypothesis to date for how the cellular components, or organelles, known as mitochondria came to be. Today, trillions of these bacterial descendants live within our bodies, churning out ATP, the molecular energy source that sustains our cells. Despite being inextricably integrated into the machinery of the human body, mitochondria also carry remnants of their bacterial past, such as their own set of DNA.\n    These features make mitochondria both a critical element of our cells and a potential source of problems. Like the DNA inside the nuclei of our cells that makes up the human genome, mitochondrial DNA can harbor mutations. Age, stress and other factors may disrupt mitochondria\u2019s many functions. On top of that, mitochondrial injury can release molecules that, due to their similarities to those made by bacteria, can be mistaken by our immune system as foreign invaders, triggering a harmful inflammatory response against our own cells.\n  There is one organ that appears to be particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial damage: our power-hungry brains.\u00a0\u201cThe more energetically demanding a cell is, the more mitochondria they have, and the more critical that mitochondria health is \u2014 so there\u2019s more potential for things to go wrong,\u201d says Andrew Moehlman, postdoctoral researcher who studies neurodegeneration at the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). According to some estimates, each neuron can have up to 2 million mitochondria.\n  A small but growing number of scientists are now turning their attention to the contributions of mitochondria in brain health. Studies in humans and lab animals \u2014 though much of it still preliminary \u2014 suggest these organelles could be key players in virtually every type of brain disorder, including neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism, psychiatric illnesses like depression and schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s. They may even be at the heart of an enduring mystery for researchers who study brain disorders: how genetic predispositions and environmental influences interact to put people at risk for developing these conditions.\n    In the 1960s, researchers discovered that mitochondria possess a unique set of genetic material. Investigations revealed that mitochondrial DNA, like that of bacteria, forms a circular strand and encodes just 37 genes \u2014 a mere fraction of the tens of thousands found in the human genome.\n  A short time later, in the 1970s, a doctoral student at Yale University named Douglas Wallace developed an interest in mitochondria DNA. Wallace reasoned that since mitochondria were the primary producers of the body\u2019s energy, mutations in their DNA would lead to disease. \u201cAt the time no one thought it was rational,\u201d he says. It wasn\u2019t until 1988, when Wallace and his colleagues established the first link between a mutation in mitochondrial DNA and a human disease \u2014 Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy, a condition that causes sudden blindness \u2014 that medical researchers began to take the idea seriously, Wallace recalls.\n  Researchers have since linked dozens of disorders to alterations in mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA related to mitochondrial function \u2014 and interestingly, the majority of these are either neurological in nature or have some effect on the brain. Wallace, who is now director of the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia\u2019s Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, has a simple explanation: Despite making up only 2 percent of a human\u2019s body weight, the brain uses roughly a fifth of the body\u2019s energy. In the same way that high-energy appliances will be disproportionately affected when voltage levels drop during a metropolitan brownout, even small reductions in mitochondrial function can have large effects on the brain, Wallace says.\n  Wallace is particularly interested in how mitochondria might contribute to autism spectrum disorder. Studies by several research teams have revealed that\u00a0 mitochondrial diseases, a mix of symptoms caused by defects in the organelle, are much more prevalent in people with autism (5 percent) than in the general population (about 0.01 percent). An additional 30 percent to 50 percent of children with autism show signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as abnormal levels of certain byproducts generated by cellular respiration, the process through which ATP is produced.\n  In some people with autism, scientists have identified genetic differences either in mitochondrial DNA, or in some of the thousand or so genes in the human genome known to influence mitochondrial function. More work is needed to establish whether these genetic variations actually cause or contribute to autism, but a recent study with mice hints that there could be a link. Wallace and colleagues reported earlier this year in\u00a0 PNAS\u00a0that a specific mutation in mitochondrial DNA can lead to autism-like traits in mice, including impaired social interactions, skittishness and compulsive behavior.\n  Genetic alterations aren\u2019t the only way mitochondria could contribute to autism. Certain environmental factors, such as toxic pollutants, have been associated with a higher risk of developing the condition. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist and autism researcher at the Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital in Arizona, and his colleagues have found that such factors may also perturb the health of mitochondria in people with autism. In one study, they found that the amount of air pollution that children with autism were exposed to before birth altered the rates at which their mitochondria produced ATP. In another, the researchers found correlations between early-life exposure to both nutritional metals such as zinc as well as toxic metals such as lead, and how well the organelles functioned in those with autism later in life. Together, Frye says, these findings suggest that mitochondria be the missing link between autism and the environmental influences that contribute to the condition.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to make any firm conclusions about a lot of this stuff, but it sure looks like the mitochondria are disrupted in many kids with autism,\u201d Frye says. \u201cAnd environmental exposures, especially early on, may be programming the mitochondria to have different types of respiratory physiology.\u201d\n  Researchers have also found signs of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as disturbances in the way they metabolize sugars to create energy, in people with schizophrenia and depression. In addition, studies also suggest that mitochondria may be sensitive to a risk factor for many mental illnesses: psychological stress in early life. For example, people who experience a traumatic event in childhood appear to have a larger number of mitochondrial genomes per cell. This uptick in mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which can indicate the formation of new mitochondria \u2014 may occur to compensate for problems in the organelle, according to Teresa Daniels, a biological psychiatry researcher at Brown University, where she is working on addressing this question. Daniels is a coauthor of a 2020 paper in the\u00a0 Annual Review of Clinical Psychology\u00a0that discusses the\u00a0 role of mitochondria in psychiatric disorders.\n  Although mitochondrial dysfunction appears in a wide range of brain disorders, it\u2019s not yet clear whether defects in these organelles are a primary cause of these conditions or a secondary effect, says Robert McCullumsmith, a physician-scientist at the University of Toledo who studies brain disorders but is not involved in the work on mitochondria. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d he says. However, McCullumsmith adds, studying the role of mitochondria in these disorders is important, and he sees promising evidence that therapeutics that target mitochondria may end up benefiting patients, even if they don\u2019t cure these conditions.\n    When mitochondria become damaged or dysfunctional, one consequence is simply less ATP, and therefore less energy for the normal operations of the brain. But another way mitochondria could contribute to brain disorders stems from their ancestral past.\n  As descendants of bacteria, mitochondria have DNA and other components that can be released when cells are injured or stressed and mistaken by our immune system as a foreign threat. In 2010, researchers at Harvard University reported a rapid release of mitochondrial DNA into the bloodstream in people with severe physical injuries \u2014 such as fractures or hemorrhages caused by a car crash. This, in turn, attracted immune cells and triggered a severe inflammatory response that mimicked sepsis \u2014 a life-threatening condition in which the immune system attacks the body\u2019s own tissues.\n  A few years later, A. Phillip West, who was then a postdoc at Yale University, and his colleagues showed that DNA can leak out of mitochondria and activate the immune system even in the absence of such severe injuries \u2014 for example, when the organelles became deficient in a key protein.\n  Inflammation caused by the release of mitochondrial DNA may contribute to the damage found in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), according to a growing number of studies. In separate lines of research, scientists have linked these disorders with both inflammation and an inability to properly rid cells of defective mitochondria. Mitochondria-triggered inflammation may be the missing link between the two.\n  For example, mutations in two genes associated with some forms of inherited Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014\u00a0 PINK1\u00a0and\u00a0 PRKN\u00a0\u2014 lead to problems in the process through which damaged mitochondria are broken down and cleared from the cell. In 2019, a group led by Richard Youle at the NINDS demonstrated that in mice with mutations in\u00a0 PINK1\u00a0and\u00a0 PRKN, inducing mitochondrial damage (either through exhaustive exercise or by altering mitochondrial DNA) activated inflammatory molecules. Those animals also lost dopamine-producing neurons in their brains and developed problems with movement \u2014 hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. These effects didn\u2019t occur, however, when the researchers repeated the experiment with mice engineered to lack an important inflammatory molecule. Together, these findings illustrated that in animals genetically predisposed to Parkinson\u2019s, either stress or glitches in mitochondrial DNA could trigger the inflammation that promotes the disease.\n    Although more work is needed to establish whether the same process occurs in humans, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of evidence that the failure to maintain the healthy mitochondria is one of the early pathological events that leads to development of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms,\u201d says Moehlman, who coauthored a 2020 paper in the \u00a0Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology\u00a0with Youle that discusses how\u00a0 problems in mitochondria may lead to neurodegeneration.\n  As evidence mounts that leaking mitochondrial DNA is bad news, some researchers are turning their attention to why. Many processes may be at play, says West, who is now an immunobiologist Texas A&amp;M University. One scenario, he says, is that the organelle ejects constant, low levels of DNA over time \u2014 and when exacerbated by genetic or environmental factors, this accumulation can reach a threshold where diseases occur.\n  Psychological stress could be one such factor. In a 2019 study, Martin Picard, a mitochondrial psychobiologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues reported that after a brief public-speaking task where participants were asked to defend themselves against an alleged transgression, levels of free-floating mitochondrial DNA in the bloodstream rose, indicating that the mitochondria had expelled their genetic material.\n  This sort of mitochondrial damage and DNA release could contribute to human diseases where inflammation appears to play a role, even in the absence of an infection, such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and neurodegenerative disorders, West says.\n  He and others also suspect that mitochondria-induced inflammation may be a key driver of aging itself. In a recent study, West\u2019s team demonstrated that mice engineered to have unstable mitochondrial DNA aged more quickly, developing problems such as hair and bone loss and dying prematurely. Eliminating the elements of the immune system activated by mitochondria DNA reversed this process, extending the animals\u2019 lifespans by around 40 days. (These results were posted before publication on bioRxiv and have yet to be peer-reviewed.) If future research bears this out, it would provide evidence that aging, in these mice at least, is partly driven by mitochondrial damage, West says.\n    Mitochondria have other functions that help maintain healthy brain function \u2014 or cause problems when they go awry. For example, mitochondria help control the balance of potentially toxic byproducts of cellular metabolism called reactive oxygen species and the synthesis of stress hormones like cortisol. Mitochondria are also highly dynamic \u2014 communicating with each other via signaling molecules and physical connections. They continuously undergo fission, where a large mitochondrion splits into two smaller ones, or fusion, when they combine. These ongoing interactions may also influence brain function and behavior in ways that researchers are only beginning to realize.\n  Carmen Sandi, a behavioral neuroscientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and her group have examined mitochondria in mice with high levels of anxiety-like behaviors, such as less willingness to spend time in open areas. They\u2019ve found that in those animals, mitochondria in the neurons of the nucleus accumbens, a brain area involved in processing reward, were less adept at producing ATP compared to those found in animals that displayed lower levels of anxiety. The high-anxiety animals also displayed lower levels of an enzyme involved in fusion \u2014 which enables mitochondria to combine and mix their contents to support one another in times of need. Increasing the level of this protein not only restored mitochondrial function, but also reduced anxious behaviors, the researchers found.\n  Findings like these give scientists reason to hope they may one day be able to develop treatments for brain disorders that target these organelles. Frye, for example, recently began a clinical trial to investigate whether nutrient supplements can reverse the mitochondrial abnormalities his team has found in children with autism. Wallace adds that researchers already know of many potential\u00a0 treatments\u00a0that help boost the function of mitochondria \u2014 from medications to behavioral interventions, such as\u00a0 exercise.\n  It will take time to test such interventions. For now, scientists are busy unraveling the multitude of functions mitochondria have in the brain. Much of this work is still preliminary, but evidence coming from a variety of disciplines \u2014 including neuroscience, immunology and psychology \u2014 has scientists excited about the future.

We can also loosely tie these cohorts to their anticipated cloud spend; identify typical tasks each user cohort is responsible for completing; assess compute and storage requirements for each user cohort; and estimate cohort size, based on survey responses.\n  Survey respondents are overwhelmingly performing  exploratory analysis using small- to medium-sized data sets stored as flat files, on local machines. Machine learning projects \u2013 if ML is being attempted at all \u2013 are in  early stages, using traditional methods that are best-suited for  high-RAM CPU rather than GPU SKUs (ex: scikit-learn and clustering approaches).\n Based on responses,  data science teams trend small (0-5 engineers), with light rigor on SDLC best practices (ex: version control); and  most data scientists come from non-CS backgrounds, with minimal programming experience. Preferred tools are overwhelmingly  open-source and non-proprietary. If Visual Studio Code is being used by survey respondents, it is most often being used for  non-interactive, production machine learning and data science work.\n   Annual survey of 6-7M registered Kaggle users. Kaggle is the world\u2019s largest online community for machine learning and data science.\n Annual survey of StackOverflow users. Not domain-specific; ~8% of respondents indicated doing data-affiliate work (data science, ML, research).\n Annual survey of Python developers, completed in partnership between the PSF and JetBrains. Not data science and ML-specific, though ~50% of respondents indicate they use Python for EDA.\n Focused survey for data analysts and ML engineers administered by Anaconda. Data not released publicly; but an executive summary is available.\n Not a domain-specific survey, and not segmented out by tools used. More than half of ML and data science respondents (5K) are hobbyists and students, and just learning how to do ML; not professionals.\n Given the focused nature of the two survey instruments,  the Anaconda survey and the Kaggle surveys were both selected as the most useful for the purpose of this analysis. The data science and machine learning respondents from the Python Developers Survey (55% of total); the professional data science and machine learning respondents for the SlashData Survey (25% of total); and the data science respondents from the StackOverflow Developer Survey (8% of total) are used as supplemental evidence.\n Though just under a third of total respondents for the Kaggle Survey and the PSF Survey indicated that they were using VS Code, this was found -- through qualitative interviews, as well as from social media scraping and Github issues analysis -- not to be for exploratory data analysis or interactive model building, but rather for  machine learning model deployment; for  other types of software development or Python library building; or for  lightweight editing of Python and markdown files.\n  The data is available to  view via Github&#39;s Flat Data, and to download from the Kaggle website.\n  The Kaggle survey data was cleaned, and then one-hot encoded for each developer tool based on survey responses. Tools used by less than 10% of respondents were removed from the dataset. We then used UMAP clustering with nearest neighbors of 32 to define clusters of users; six distinct clusters were found and translated into cohorts, with no apparent correlation to self-assigned role title.\n  Clusters were validated with the qualitative data in the Anaconda Data Science Survey, as well as with blog and social media posts; StackOverflow issues; and Github issues (for example: ML Ops engineers tend to have backgrounds that fall more commonly on the &#34;software engineering&#34; side of the spectrum).\n  Primary findings from the aggregated survey responses can be found below. The numbers adjacent to each bullet point indicate which survey above (1 through 5) supports each assessment.\n  Many of the survey respondents  do not have a computer science background, but have been trained in some other domain (physical, natural or biological sciences; statistics; etc.) -- often obtaining a graduate or professional degree. [1,2,3,4]\n Most survey respondents have been  programming for less than a decade, and have less than three years of experience with machine learning or software engineering. [1,4]\n The majority of survey respondents  work in small teams (0-5 engineers), or in large communities of practice (20+ engineers). These data scientists are not likely to be using version control systems; but do often  indicate using GitHub as both a place to find code for their experiments, and a way to showcase their work. [1,4,5]\n Most survey respondents appear to be in their  late 20s or early 30s, with 60% between 22 and 34. Only 20% are above the age of 40; and there are signs of the numbers skewing even younger, as Generation Z becomes more involved with data science and machine learning work.  Nearly 7% of Kaggle survey data scientists are aged 18-21, an increase from 5% in 2019. [1,2,4,5]\n  Jupyter products (JupyterLab and original Jupyter notebooks)  are the overwhelming winner in terms of IDE use (74.1%), with VS Code, PyCharm, and RStudio neck-in-neck for second place (all around 32%).  It is common for survey respondents to use more than one development environment. [1,2,3,4,5]\n Survey respondents prefer having a  quick scratchpad that is automatically connected to data sources and does not require manual authentication. Though free-tier hosted notebooks (ex: Colab, Binder) are used by a subset of respondents, hosting and sharing code externally is not a P0. [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are using  small to medium-sized data sets that can fit in memory. [1,4]\n These data sets are usually comprised of  local flat files (CSVs, JSON, etc.), or tables exported from relational databases. Data lakes and non-SQL databases are rarely used, if ever. [1,4]\n Preferred databases are primarily open-source ( PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.), though a significant number of users are opting for Microsoft SQL Server. [1]\n Exploratory data analysis is a significant component of both data science and machine learning work; and is usually done using open-source libraries.  Please note: EDA is distinct from and a precursor to ETL pipeline-building.[1,4]\n Little to no exploratory data analysis is being done using large clusters of machines (Spark, Dask). If these tools are used, it is most commonly by the cohorts that are described in the table below as ML Ops professionals, data engineers, or deep learning engineers. [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are doing either  exploratory data analysis, or traditional machine learning with scikit-learn. These models are most commonly logistic and linear regression; random forests and decision trees; Bayesian methods; and gradient boosted trees. [1,3,4]\n It is common for data scientists to use more than one language \u2013 and the usual suspects are  R, Python, and SQL. [1,2,3,4,5]\n Most survey respondents  are not using automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques, or experiment management and model orchestration tools (ex: Weights &amp; Biases, MLFlow). [1,4]\n  Most survey respondents are  not yet using machine learning in production, though that number is steadily increasing year over year (28.9% in 2019 compared to 30.8% in 2020). [1,4,5]\n Most survey respondents are  not yet using self-hosted cloud technologies, though they often leverage third-party hosted notebooks (ex: Colab, Binder). [1]\n Segmenting out Kaggle survey respondents who indicated spending more than $100K (n = 729) on cloud resources, we find that:\n There are a substantial number of respondents using Power BI and Tableau (22% and 30%, respectively).\n Azure jumps to second place (31%) for survey respondents who indicate that they spend more than $100K on cloud resources. For survey respondents in aggregate, the second most popular cloud is GCP. The most popular cloud for both segments is AWS.\n Large-scale cloud customers have even less of a focus on deep learning; if they are using machine learning at all, they are using traditional models.\n Only half of large-scale cloud compute users (49%) are using GPUs - and, even for those users, those GPUs are local.\n Survey respondents who indicated spending $100K or more on cloud resources were more likely to be tenured employees (5+ years of experience).\n The other data points still hold: VS Code is in a distant second place to Jupyter* as an IDE; flat files and relational databases still most common data sources; most teams don\u2019t have machine learning models running in production and are still exploring; etc.\n  The survey data described above has been used to create a customer cohort table (distilled view below).\n Please note: this table is not meant to be a comprehensive assessment of each of these cohort groups and the tools they used; just a brief overview. Additional blog posts with a deep dive for each group to follow.\n New to programming, data science, and machine learning. Canonical example would be high school and college students. Primary mechanism to learn is video content (Coursera, YouTube, EdX, etc.).\n New to data science and ML, and just beginning to learn.

The operations team will be running tests and collecting more information on the system to further isolate the problem. The science instruments will remain in a safe mode state until the issue is resolved. The telescope itself and science instruments remain in good health.\n The computer halted on Sunday, June 13. An attempt to restart the computer failed on Monday, June 14. Initial indications pointed to a degrading computer memory module as the source of the computer halt. When the operations team attempted to switch to a back-up memory module, however, the command to initiate the backup module failed to complete. Another attempt was conducted on both modules Thursday evening to obtain more diagnostic information while again trying to bring those memory modules online. However, those attempts were not successful.\n The payload computer is a NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer-1 (NSSC-1) system built in the 1980s that is located on the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling unit. The computer\u2019s purpose is to control and coordinate the science instruments and monitor them for health and safety purposes. It is fully redundant in that a second computer, along with its associated hardware, exists on orbit that can be switched over to in the event of a problem. Both computers can access and use any of four independent memory modules, which each contain 64K of Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) memory. The payload computer uses only one memory module operationally at a time, with the other three serving as backups.\n  Launched in 1990, Hubble has contributed greatly to our understanding of the

See our  ethics statement.\n    Minority languages are often associated with aging rural communities, thought to have fallen out of use or confined to textbooks. Defined simply as a language spoken by less than half of the population in a country, they adapt with the times like any living language, often due to the efforts of enterprising young people.\n Recently, many of these languages have found new life from an unexpected source: video game streamers.\n On Twitch, streamers from around the world are showcasing indigenous languages as a form of entertainment and activism.  Estimates show that we lose one language every two weeks, and half of our 7,000 languages will be extinct by the end of the century, so preserving these tongues and the cultural identities that go with them is crucial. With its easy access, potential for a huge audience, and creators\u2019 ability to combine hobbies and language promotion, it\u2019s easy to see why young minority language speakers have turned to Twitch.\n Many minority language streamers lack an official language tag for their streams, and these creators see their content lost in the miscellany of the \u201cOther\u201d tag, making it hard for other speakers to find, connect with, and enjoy gaming in their own language. Good news arrived for some on May 26th when Twitch announced that it would  add over 350 new stream tags, encompassing different ethnic groups and underrepresented communities. The platform was frank about how it has been slow to act on adding the tags users want. However, not all streamers received the opportunity for visibility they\u2019d been hoping for.\n  Two groups who missed out were Basque and Galician streamers. Basque, which is native to the semi-autonomous Basque Country straddling southwestern France and northern Spain, is one of the oldest languages still spoken and unrelated to any other in the world. Further along the Iberian Peninsula, the Galician language is spoken by around 2.4 million people in a tiny corner of Spain.\n Inspired by the success of the #CatalanLoveTwitch campaign, which saw the minority Romance language added as a streaming language tag, a group of Basque streamers launched #3000Twitz last December, a campaign to see their language achieve the same status. Despite a petition, which is by far the most voted in the Twitch User Voice forums and having now surpassed the number of votes the Catalan petition received, Basque streamers are still awaiting a response from the streaming giant.\n Iru\u00f1e, who streams as arkkuso, is one of the founding members of the campaign. For her, the addition of Basque as a streaming language has broader implications for the survival and visibility of the language. \u201cIt is very important that Basque has a presence online and therefore on social networks,\u201d she says. \u201cNowadays, if you\u2019re not on the internet, you don\u2019t exist. The same will happen very soon with languages.\u201d\n \u201cNowadays, if you\u2019re not on the internet, you don\u2019t exist\u201d\n Without the help of a tag to identify streamers, Iru\u00f1e feels that Twitch has made Basque creators invisible. As a result, the growth of the Basque streaming community has been entirely grassroots, and language activism is part and parcel of her channel. \u201cI believe that at the end of the day, all of us who create content in Basque are [activists],\u201d she says. \u201cFor many of us, the relationship we have with our mother tongue is fundamental for us when it comes to enjoying what we do.\u201d\n Fellow streamer and native Basque speaker Eneko found himself in a similar situation. \u201cAt first, I started streaming without knowing anyone on Twitch. And since there was no Basque language tag, I didn\u2019t know if there were more people or if they were just very difficult to find. I hit a roadblock because I wanted to stream in Basque, but it meant not reaching anyone,\u201d he says. The current camaraderie between Basque streamers and the popular support their campaign enjoys would have seemed like a fantasy when he first started out.\n \u201cWhen you meet people, it is through raids and not by randomly finding someone streaming the type of content you like. There are campaigns calling for double labeling because today, many of us speak several languages, and choosing only one (especially when one is a minority) greatly reduces your ability to reach people. In these circumstances, either you participate in the digital disappearance of your language or you remain visible only to a very small part of Twitch.\u201d\n The collective Galician Gamers launched a language tag petition around the same time as their Basque neighbors, with the aim of \u201cpromoting the use of Galician, not only as a home life language, but as a language for culture and entertainment as well.\u201d Dubbed \u201cTwitch en Galego\u201d (\u201cTwitch in Galician\u201d), the movement\u2019s social media accounts announce when any Galician-speaking streamer is going live and has exploded from a small group of four or five streamers to having a Discord server with over 200 members with 58 Twitch channels registered.\n Given that other less popular language petitions such as Ukrainian have now been added as official streaming languages, Iru\u00f1e is understandably frustrated. \u201cWe are going to continue creating varied content in Basque, quality content that we want to use to reach more people as we are still a small community. Likewise, we want to create channels of dialogue with Twitch, and for this, we want to work together with the Basque government as well as get Basque streamers who have lots of followers to help us achieve this.\u201d\n Adri\u00e1n, who goes by Dinav in the Galician Gamers team, is equally undeterred. CRTVG, a regional TV network in Galicia, recently created a Twitch channel and invited the Galician Gamers on to discuss their cause. \u201cThough we\u2019ll still act independently, organising events on certain dates to generate movement on the internet and get more people to sign the request, getting the support of Galician public institutions is a path we are open to explore.\u201d\n  On the other side of the world, a community of streamers of te reo M\u0101ori, the indigenous language of New Zealand, is thriving. Despite suffering a decline after the Second World War, it has been enjoying a renaissance due to revitalization efforts in recent years, including national M\u0101ori Language Week and M\u0101ori immersion schools. According to the 2018 census, 4 percent of the population speaks the language.\n Twitch creator Rangiora has lived his whole life through teo reo M\u0101ori. Combining his two passions, he streams under the moniker PrideLandz, and it\u2019s only natural that he would do so in his native tongue. \u201cTe reo M\u0101ori is what connects me to my culture, my ancestors, my family, my environment, and helps to navigate the world I live in,\u201d he shares. \u201cIn the last five years, I noticed I was speaking next to no M\u0101ori because I wasn\u2019t surrounded by confident speakers. Streaming in M\u0101ori has provided a space where I can practice, share, and learn about the language more often.\u201d\n One of the most fascinating aspects of M\u0101ori streamers\u2019 content is their incorporation of an ancestral language into modern gaming. As he lays waste to beasts on the screen superimposed behind him, Rangiora explains how game titles are translated into te reo M\u0101ori.  Call of Duty is composed using the name of the M\u0101ori god of war, translating as something like \u201ca call to arms in the realm of T\u016bmatauenga.\u201d\n  His streams are open to speakers of all levels and even those just interested in learning more about the culture. \u201cI don\u2019t stream entirely in M\u0101ori, but I try to share some knowledge such as having M\u0101ori word of the week or M\u0101ori phrase or saying as something viewers can redeem with their channel points. Hopefully we can inspire more people to speak [the language] because I\u2019m aware that a lot of M\u0101ori [people] aren\u2019t confident due to colonization and the suppression in the past. I feel as if people are learning something every time I stream as we try to normalize M\u0101ori in this space.\u201d\n The community of M\u0101ori and Pacific Islander streamers on Twitch have been a huge motivator for Rangiora, so much so that he\u2019s launched a campaign to achieve Partner status on the platform. Spurred on by support from Ngati Gaming, a Discord community of M\u0101ori streamers, the ultimate goal is to launch a M\u0101ori esports organization.\n  Multiplayer online gaming has been a lifeline for speakers of regional tongues to stay connected over the course of the pandemic. YnChwarae, meaning \u201cIn Play,\u201d is a group of Welsh language streamers. Pre-COVID, they met monthly to livestream games while chatting in Welsh; for the time being, they\u2019ve brought their club online on a weekly basis. \u201cI feel it\u2019s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable. For Welsh as a language to grow quicker, there has to be a space for people to do everything in Welsh and this includes the digital realm,\u201d says Morgan from the group. \u201cGaming can be an extremely sociable activity and the majority of our streams reflect this.\u201d\n Despite a gradually increasing amount Welsh speakers over the last decade, there\u2019s still work to be done in maintaining its survival. \u201cA lot of the crew are not able to use Welsh in their everyday jobs, so streaming with YnChwarae gives them the opportunity to use the language meaningfully doing something they love and not forget it,\u201d Morgan explains. \u201cWe are allowing other Welsh speakers to access Welsh language content on Twitch and be a part of our streams through communicating with us in the chat.\u201d\n Lacking in the community size of their Welsh counterparts, streamers of other Celtic languages have pioneered the use of their tongue on Twitch. Gwenn, a streamer from Brittany in the northwest of France, is the only person on Twitch who regularly streams in Breton, the traditional language of the region. As a severely endangered language, Breton faces more challenges than just visibility online. Having lost around 800,000 speakers since 1950, the language is not recognized at a national level by the French state, and so it receives little government support in media or public services.\n \u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to express yourself in the language you feel most comfortable\u201d\n \u201cI think it is important for Breton to be everywhere Breton speakers are,\u201d Gwenn says. \u201cThere are a lot of young Breton speakers, and they use what young people use: Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Instagram... I think it\u2019s a good thing to grow minority language communities on those platforms.\u201d\n Like YnChwarae, the interactive aspect of Twitch is a huge draw. Although happy to help learners, Gwenn\u2019s target audience is advanced speakers. \u201cWhen I stream, the beginners can take their time to write out sentences that I will read and correct, and the people who are fluent are happy with just meeting other Breton-speaking people, which could be already rare in the pre-lockdown world and is even rarer now. That is why I usually stream chill games like  GeoGuessr that allow [people] to read the chat and have subjects to talk about.\u201d\n Twitch\u2019s addition of new tags is bittersweet. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for the communities that will benefit from those new tags. I wasn\u2019t expecting Twitch to add minority languages, so I\u2019m not really disappointed. I will follow what happens for more active language communities like Basque to see if it is something that can be achievable for Breton before trying to spend energy on this.\u201d\n Cluicheamaid, the brainchild of Scottish streamer Robbie, is an award-nominated Scots Gaelic video game streaming series including  Fall Guys,  Among Us, and  Dark Souls III all in the ancient Scottish tongue. Classed as definitely endangered on the UNESCO Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger, Robbie\u2019s channel is an opportunity for speakers to use their Gaelic in a world without English subtitles. \u201cStreaming is such a new form of entertainment, and I like giving Gaelic representation on the cutting edge,\u201d he says.\n Existing in a linguistic niche has given him a different perspective of what success on Twitch looks like. \u201cThere are fewer folk I can get watching my stream in terms of total numbers, but also I am not in competition with thousands of other video game streamers at the same time. I think when you grow up speaking a minoritised language, you have to adjust your expectations of success. Every stream that I get four or five folk all talking Gaelic in the chat feels like a massive win because that is what it is.\u201d\n  Included in Twitch\u2019s recent launch of new tags is \u201cScottish,\u201d referring streamers from Scotland as opposed to those speaking Scots Gaelic. Irish, Welsh, and M\u0101ori creators found themselves with a new national identifier for their streams. For minority language speakers who fall into these groups, the reaction in terms of linguistic visibility has been ambivalent. \u201cLanguage tags would be more useful to me than nationality tags,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cMy stream will have more in common with Irish-language streamers than most generic \u2018Scottish\u2019 streams. So I am hopeful but not expectant that the addition of the new tags is a step towards more easy identification.\u201d\n  Across the sea in Ireland, \u00dana-Minh \u2014 or yunitex as she is known on Twitch \u2014 has brought the Irish national language to an audience of over 2,500 followers. Like Gwenn and Robbie, she is the only person regularly creating content in her language, but the main aim of her bilingual channel isn\u2019t activism. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m using it [Irish] as I would in my everyday life, and if that inspires people to become more interested, then that\u2019s a welcome bonus,\u201d she explains.\n She has partnered with language-learning app Duolingo to bring a little more Gaeilge to the world through her streams, be that through livestreaming  Final Fantasy or painting and sketching. However, she believes that minority language Twitch creators like herself can\u2019t be at the forefront of language revival alone. \u201cToo many times do I see people treating people like me, fluent speakers, like their personal teachers or translators, and it\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m not a teacher, I\u2019m just me. I think it\u2019s important that communities don\u2019t rely on one person ever to be a beacon, they need to work together to keep the language alive.\u201d\n With or without formal support from Twitch, those who stream in minority languages are doing the important work of ensuring that their mother tongue is used among young people, outside of the classroom, and within a modern context \u2014 the key ingredients for survival.\n Aur\u00e9lie Joubert, assistant professor of Language and Society at the University of Groningen, is all too aware of this. \u201cThe problem is that for languages to survive, they need to be considered as equal in their function and their communicative value for their own community. Language planners have realized that if kids nowadays speak more Irish, Breton, or Basque at school, it doesn\u2019t mean that they use it in the playground. The reality is that a language needs to be perceived positively everywhere. This type of modern online interaction attracts the younger generation who needs to see and hear their minority language being used in modern online platforms.\u201d\n Across linguistic groups, one thing remains clear: minority language movements on Twitch are grassroots, community-centric, and driven by small gains.

probably aliens elsewhere in the universe. But the UFO\u2019s we\u2019ve heard about lately are not them. Instead, what we\u2019re seeing is ordinary phenomena, treated irresponsibly and incompetently by the news media.\n  The Drake Equation is supposed to help us estimate the number of civilizations in our galaxy that we might detect. It says:\n The # of civilizations we can receive signals from = (the average rate of star formation in our galaxy)*(the fraction of stars that have planets)*(the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets)*(the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life)*(the fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life)*(the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signals into space)*(the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space)\n  The main problem with this equation is that it gives us the desired quantity in terms of seven other quantities that are almost all unknown. (Maybe the first one is known?) So that\u2019s not so helpful for estimating anything.\n Here\u2019s another try. There are said to be on the order of 10^22 stars in the known universe. What\u2019s the probability that at least one of those stars, other than the Sun, has life living around it? Obviously, no one knows. But there is an argument that there are probably some such other stars, given the information that (i) there is life here, and (ii) there is an extremely large number of other stars.\n Note: It\u2019s hard to appreciate how large 10^22 is. That\u2019s ten thousand million million millions. We can\u2019t adequately grasp such an astronomical quantity. But here is something that helps: Have a look at the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image (below). That picture came from aiming the Hubble space telescope at a particularly dark-looking area of the night sky (to avoid light from \u201cnearby\u201d stars). The image captures ~10,000 points of light. Each one of those dots is a  galaxy, containing an average of 100 billion stars. Some of those are ~13 billion years old. That\u2019s all found in a tiny area equal to one  26 millionth of the area of the night sky. If you hold up a 1 mm square at arm\u2019s length, it would cover up those 10,000 galaxies.\n  In place of the 7 quantities in the Drake Equation, let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a quantity, p, which is the physical probability (or \u201cobjective chance\u201d) of a random star having at least one life-supporting planet. We know very little about the value of p. It\u2019s nonzero (since there is life here), and I think we can safely say that it is lower than 50%, maybe much lower.\n We can entertain hypotheses about the value of p. Suppose p is, say, 1%. In that case, there should be about 10^20 life-supporting star systems out there. Suppose p is only one in a million. Then there should still be about ten million billion life-supporting stars. If p is one in a  trillion, there should be ten billion life-supporting stars.\n Of course, it\u2019s easy to hypothesize values of p such that it\u2019s unlikely that that there would be more than one life-supporting star in the universe. Just set p really, really low. But not  too low \u2013 if life is extremely improbable, then we shouldn\u2019t be here. (In general, if a theory assigns an extremely low probability to some event, and we observe that event to happen, then this is strong evidence against the theory. So we have strong evidence that the value of  p is not so low that we should expect there not to be life anywhere in the universe.)\n To create any reasonable chance of having  exactly one life-supporting star, we have to set p extremely close to 1/10^22. If it\u2019s less than that, then we should expect not to be here ourselves. If it\u2019s more than that, then we should expect there to be multiple life-supporting stars. But it would be a bizarre coincidence if p just happened to be extremely close to one over the number of stars in the universe. (There\u2019s no reason for p to be tied to the # of stars that happen to exist in our universe.)\n Mathy aside: Here\u2019s the formula: P(exactly one life-supporting star) = (10^22)*(p)*[(1-p)^{(10^22)-1}]. If p is almost exactly 1/10^22, that comes out to close to one third. Otherwise, it comes out to about zero.\n This type of argument, btw, can be applied to any event with an unknown physical probability: In a large number of trials, it is highly unlikely that the number of occurrences of the event will be  exactly one. The larger the # of trials, the less likely this is. If the # of trials is one of these astronomical numbers like 10^22, then it\u2019s incredibly improbable that you have exactly one occurrence.\n Caveats: There could of course be  other information about the probability of the event that this reasoning ignores. E.g., we  could have other evidence that indicates that life is extremely difficult to create, so difficult as to have a probability less than 10^-22. I haven\u2019t addressed this. I also haven\u2019t addressed the proportion of life-supporting planets that develop intelligence.\n  Contrary to slightly scientifically-informed opinion, it\u2019s not impossible or ridiculous that,  if there were intelligent aliens in our galaxy, they could come here. This would not require some new physics or warp drives. It  would require what we consider extremely long voyages. Most stars in our galaxy are thousands of light years away, so it would take  at least thousands of years for an alien civilization to reach us from most places where they could be, even tens of thousands of years. However, I don\u2019t see what\u2019s impossible or absurd about this.\n If there is another planet where civilization arose, it probably arose  millions, maybe even  billions of years before we did. That\u2019s because of the extreme differences in the ages of planets across the galaxy, as well as the extremely unpredictable course of events leading to civilization.\n If there is a civilization  millions of years more advanced than us, it probably cured aging within its first 100,000 years. Members of that civilization could very well be millions of years old. They would have enormous wealth and material resources. And they could very well have launched missions (either manned or unmanned) to other stars thousands of years ago, planning to hear news from those missions thousands of years later. This doesn\u2019t strike me as particularly unlikely at all.\n   Lately, UFO enthusiasm is spreading. The  New York Times ran this headline and teaser text: \u201c U.S. Finds No Evidence of Alien Technology in Flying Objects, but Can\u2019t Rule It Out, Either: A new report concedes that much about the observed phenomena remains difficult to explain, including their acceleration, as well as ability to change direction and submerge.\u201d ( https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/us/politics/ufos-sighting-alien-spacecraft-pentagon.html)\n Fox News reports that UFO\u2019s have gone from the fringe to the mainstream. They mention \u201cserious defense implications\u201d, and they include some of the mysterious footage. They include a UFO enthusiast \u00a0talking about the amazing capabilities of these objects. ( https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unclassified-ufo-findings-us-intel-community-cant-explain-aerial-objects)\n Tucker Carlson has reported about UFO\u2019s repeatedly. Marco Rubio is urging the government to seriously investigate them.\n   Some of these reports mention that the Pentagon found no evidence of aliens, but they go on to imply that it could still be aliens, and they try to make it sound as if that\u2019s a likely theory. They show clips from some of the UFO\u2019s that have been caught on camera, sometimes they interview UFOlogists, but they do  not interview UFO skeptics. They mention that the U.S. military has \u201cconfirmed\u201d that the videos are \u201creal\u201d, or that they were taken by military personnel.\n    It raises an interesting point: Why do UFO\u2019s only get photographed with really low-quality cameras, or in really bad conditions (out of focus, low light, very far away, etc.)? This continues to be true, even as high quality cameras become more widespread.\n Hypothesis: It\u2019s a selection effect. High quality images get selected out because they never look like alien spacecraft, because there aren\u2019t any alien spacecraft around here.\n  There are a few video clips that keep getting replayed. I did a little searching for explanations, and here is what I found:\n  This is a video taken by a military pilot. It shows a black, roughly round object with a kind of halo of light around it. The object seems to rotate slowly. It\u2019s very mysterious. (\u201cGimbal\u201d is the Navy\u2019s name for the video.)\n Here is an explanation (includes the original video clip, with explanation of what it actually is):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr1cfpos6vo\n Summary: The video shows infrared glare from the engine of another airplane. The actual airplane can\u2019t be seen, just the heat from the engine. The camera rotates during the filming, which causes the glare to rotate. There is an automatic compensation mechanism in the camera that causes the horizon to continue to appear level even when the camera rotates, but it doesn\u2019t stop the glare from rotating. A similar effect was reproduced by a debunker using his own infrared camera aimed at a passing jet.\n  This is a video of a blurry, tic-tac-shaped object. At the end of the video, the object seems to shoot off to the left suddenly. This seems to show amazing maneuvering capabilities.\n  Summary: It is a very far away airplane, seen from the side, moving to the left. It is so far that it just appears as an elongated smudge. The object stays in the center of the picture for most of the video due to the auto-tracking camera. At the end of the video, the pilot switches lenses and changes the zoom from 1x to 2x. This causes the camera to lose the target lock and hence stop tracking the object. Hence, the object appears to shoot off to the left.\n  This is a video, taken by another military pilot, of a roundish object which appears to be flying extremely fast, close to the surface of the ocean.\n  Summary: The object is probably a balloon. It is not close to the surface of the ocean; it\u2019s roughly halfway between the altitude of the airplane and the ocean surface. The apparent speed of the balloon is due to parallax \u2013 basically, the balloon appears to be moving quickly relative to the water because the  jet is moving quickly while the camera tracks that balloon.\n  This is a video taken from a U.S. naval ship, which appears to show pyramid-shaped, flashing objects flying through the air.\n  Summary: If you film a light with a camera that is badly out of focus, the light will appear to take the shape of the lens aperture. Some cameras have triangular apertures. The video shows a normal airplane with flashing lights. The ship that took this video was under the flight path of airplanes flying from Asia to Los Angeles.\n  Those were all from Mick West, who is a dedicated UFO debunker. Here is a playlist of his videos:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-4ZqTjKmhn5Qr0tCHkCVnqTx_c0P3O2t\n  This was another case of the news media being full of crap. I see two possibilities:\n Dishonesty: They\u2019re trying to make viewers think that maybe there are space aliens here, when they know that\u2019s not true. Why might they do this? Clickbait. They don\u2019t care about accuracy; they just want people to watch and share their stories.\n Utter incompetence: It took me under an hour on the internet to find the above explanations. I looked for explanations on YouTube, and the first video I found referenced Mick West. I then looked up Mick West\u2019s web site, which lists all his videos. That was my research. So we can infer that the \u201cjournalists\u201d working for the UFO-crazed media sources did less than that amount of research. Which is to say, they must have made no effort at all to find explanations for the videos that they keep replaying clips of.\n After you see enough BS like this, you realize that this is just how the media operate. They make approximately zero effort to check their stories, and they try to sensationalize and spin everything.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 00:00:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

crater on our planet\u2019s surface.\n   Boltysh crater, a 15-mile-wide formation in central Ukraine, may not be as famous as the Chicxulub crater under the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico, which is directly implicated in the death of the dinosaurs and many other species about 66 million years ago. Nevertheless, Boltysh has long led to debate among scientists. Some have suggested that the crater, which is buried under more than 1,000 feet of sediment, could have formed before or after the Chicxulub event, making its role in this cataclysmic period unclear.\n Now, a team led by Annemarie Pickersgill, a research associate at the University of Glasgow, estimates that Boltysh formed about 650,000 years after the Chicxulub catastrophe. The refined age has implications for understanding how Boltysh affected this tumultuous time, and can shed light on our own era of sudden climate change.\n For  a study published on Friday in Science Advances, the researchers performed a technique known as argon-argon dating with rocks extracted from Boltysh. They also analyzed specimens from a geological layer in Montana, the K-Pg boundary, that marks the dramatic transition wrought by the Chicxulub impact. This comparative approach, along with advances in radiometric dating methods, yielded a more refined sequence of events than previous studies.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the first comparison of Boltysh samples directly to K-Pg boundary samples,\u201d Dr. Pickersgill said. \u201cBecause we analyzed everything under the same experimental conditions, we could neglect a lot of the uncertainties that we would get if, say, one lab had analyzed the K-Pg boundary and a different lab had analyzed Boltysh.\u201d\n The new age estimate places Boltysh about a half-million years after the dinosaur-killing asteroid, contradicting the conclusions of  a 2010 study in Geology that dated it to a few thousand years before Chicxulub. The researchers who wrote that paper embraced the new findings, and some became co-authors of Dr. Pickersgill\u2019s study.\n \u201cThe guys who did the previous work, who ended up being my collaborators, are really good scientists,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came up with an answer that apparently conflicted with their results, I was surprised and somewhat alarmed. But we double-checked everything and the data is what it is.\u201d\n \u201cIt was a very nice science experience for me because they were so happy to adopt the new hypothesis and come up with new interpretations,\u201d she added.\n  For years, scientists  speculated that the Boltysh and Chicxulub impactors may have acted as a one-two punch that shattered life at the end of the Cretaceous period. The revised age suggests that the impact that made the Ukrainian crater did not factor into the apocalyptic die-off of the dinosaurs, though it may have interfered with the recovery from the mass extinction.\n Dr. Pickersgill\u2019s team raises the possibility that Boltysh could be linked to a warming event, called the lower C29N hyperthermal, which occurred around the same time, though confirming that relationship would require more substantial evidence.\n Sean Gulick, a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the new age for Boltysh appeared sound, but that he doubted the impact had any connection to the coincident hyperthermal or the pace of recovery from the extinction.\n \u201cThis is an important study\u201d that can help \u201cunravel this question about whether smaller events have had major climate effects or not,\u201d Dr. Gulick said.\n \u201cI think in this case, the evidence would be that it didn\u2019t, necessarily,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the only way we can figure that out is if you get these really precise dates.\u201d\n Pinpointing these connections not only opens a window into Earth\u2019s ancient history, but it can also help us prepare for modern human-driven climate change.\n \u201cMany of my colleagues are paleoclimatologists \u2014 they\u2019re studying the effects of climate in the past \u2014 and the reason they\u2019re doing that is out of nerdiness, but also to understand what\u2019s happening to the climate right now,\u201d Dr. Pickersgill said.\n Ken Amor, a geochemist at the University of Oxford, also emphasized the importance of assessing the risk of Boltysh-scale impactors striking Earth. Chicxulub-level impacts appear to be extremely rare \u201cBlack Swan events,\u201d he said, but our planet is vulnerable to smaller objects, like the roughly one-mile-wide impactor that produced Boltysh.\n \u201cSomething like that falling on London or Paris or somewhere would just totally wipe it out,\u201d Dr. Amor said. \u201cThe chances of that happening on human time scales is quite small, but there does always remain that possibility.\u201d\n He added that one way to build on the new study was to collect more samples from Boltysh and other impact craters to further refine their ages and the properties of the objects that created them.

I really wanted to keep this as quiet as possible, but I don&#39;t feel I can anymore. Here&#39;s my side of what happened.  On an exchange like MtGox, there are typically hundreds of standing &#34;buy orders&#34; where people are offering to buy bitcoins at various amounts and prices. When a large sell order comes in, an exchange will start with the highest priced buy order, match up the buyer and seller, then move down to the next lowest buy order. This repeats until the entire quantity of bitcoins being sold have found buyers, or there are no more buyers at the minimum price the seller was willing to accept.  I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn&#39;t execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn&#39;t merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market&#39;s total bitcoins at once.  I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I&#39;d made. I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and everyone was saying that it wasn&#39;t accepting trades. I had to try several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.  The site stopped responding completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:   06/19/11 17:51\u00a0 Bought BTC\u00a0 259684.77 for 0.0101  I had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I tried to figure out what to do. I wasn&#39;t sure what was really going on. Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about Mt Gox&#39;s security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now and force my account to execute some other crazy trade.  I attempted to withdraw the bitcoin balance into my own wallet, and hit the limit that Mt Gox has, preventing you from withdrawing more than $1000 USD worth of bitcoins (at the current market value) in a day. This transferred 643.27 bitcoins to my personal bitcoin account before hitting that limit. It was pretty well known that the limit for transferring bitcoins was actually broken in Mt Gox. It stopped you from moving more than that in one withdrawal, but you could immediately ask for more and get another $1000 USD worth, over and over. I decided against this, since it was exploiting a bug, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to do anything suspicious looking or improper.   The thought also occurred to me that there were only about 100 bitcoins worth of buy orders back on the market in the minutes immediately following all of this. I could place a reasonably sized sell order for $0.001, crash the market again, and withdraw probably all of the bitcoins, since they&#39;d be valued at $0.001 each and would fit under the $1000 USD limit. I also decided against this, when I realized that whoever placed the gigantic sell order was probably doing so for the exact same reasons and I knew how that would make me look.  I then sent an private message on IRC to MagicalTux (Mark Karpeles, the founder of Mt Gox) to explain that I was the one who won the giant buy order, and that I wasn&#39;t the same person as whoever placed the huge sell order. We&#39;d talked previously, including a private talk a couple of days ago about Mt Gox&#39;s &#34;change my password&#34; system not working. He didn&#39;t respond to me at all, but I figured he was busy. A few minutes later he was saying in public that he&#39;d decided to reverse all the recent trades, effectively undoing the final 3602 trades that were executed before he shut the site down.  We talked a bit, and I started to become increasingly concerned with what Mt Gox was saying in public which was totally contradicting what I knew to have happened. The Mt Gox status page said:    &#34;One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.&#34;\n There are three very misleading elements in that line alone.  First, this makes it sound like the &#34;hacker&#34; is the one who was buying back all the bitcoins at a penny. We all were watching the trades execute in real time, there was only one buy order of anywhere near the size of the huge sell order that went through, and I was the buyer not the hacker. Other people in IRC were saying which other buy orders they were able to get. The hacker couldn&#39;t have been able to buy back even 10% of the bitcoins that were sold during the sell-off. Did this mean Mark thought *I* was the hacker? I have repeatedly asked him this question, which he&#39;s managed to ignore each time.  Recently I&#39;ve been getting into the bitcoin trading market. Over the last couple of weeks, I was hitting the $1000 USD Dwolla cash withdrawal limit from Mt Gox, so I requested that it be increased. I sent Mt Gox a copy of my driver&#39;s license and two utility bills in my name/address to prove my identity, which Mark accepted and increased my limit. Could that have been faked? Sure. But, if I was the hacker I was going about this whole thing stupidly. I had several ways I could have drained the Mt Gox account, and deliberately didn&#39;t. I immediately contacted Mark to identify myself as the buyer and offer assistance. If I were up to something shady, I was doing a really bad job at it.  The second thing wrong with Mt Gox&#39;s statement is that it makes it sound like only the hacker managed to withdraw any money, and even then only $1000 worth. I alone withdrew 643 bitcoins (worth more than $10,000 USD easily). The withdrawal limit feature was so broken, it was hard to imagine the hacker didn&#39;t know how to exploit it.  On top of how misleading I felt they were being about what I knew occurred, I felt it was far worse that they were using this argument for why they wanted to undo the trades. From reading their public statements, they&#39;re making it sound like they&#39;re reverting the trades because they want to prevent a hacker from profiting from it. This is simply not true, the vast majority, if not all of the buy orders that picked up coins at a low price were regular users like myself. Any profit this hacker was going to make, he&#39;s already done so. The majority of the buy orders that got executed were standing orders from legit users that had been in the system for quite some time, and those are the orders he&#39;s threatening to revert.  And this is where I, like others here, have a problem. Of course I am greatly biased here, but look at what&#39;s going on:   1)  Rolling back/Breaking trades is something Mt Gox said they wouldn&#39;t do.  Many exchanges will break trades if something truly unusual happened, but there&#39;s a policy listed in advance so everyone knows how, when and why it will kick in. Mt Gox never claimed they felt they had the authority to undo trades, in fact the Mt Gox website states:    &#34;You are trading with other users of Mt Gox. Mt Gox does not act as a counter party to any trades.&#34;\n Claiming that Mt Gox isn&#39;t a &#34;counter party&#34; to trades has a specific legal meaning. Typically market participants, stock brokers and other associated people are &#34;counter parties&#34; or &#34;central counter parties&#34; to trades, taking on the burden of insuring trades were executed properly. Put simply, Mt Gox was saying in legal terms they were only acting as a match maker between buyers and sellers, not involving themselves in any issues that may come up from the trades themselves.  If they&#39;re claiming they have no responsibility for what occurs, that means they don&#39;t get to flex any control over it. You&#39;re either merely introducing buyers and sellers to each other and have no liability or power over what happens after that point, or you are a central counter party to the trade and do get to make those decisions. Mt Gox is trying to have it both ways, after telling us that they didn&#39;t want the responsibility. No rollback policy was ever published or even discussed anywhere I could find.    2)  Mt Gox had been repeatedly warned about password security issues recently, and continued to reassure us everything was safe.  An exchange cannot be allowed to reassure customers of their security and fail to accept responsibility when it is proven to be insecure. As customers of Mt Gox, we cannot have the same visibility into their systems that they do and must rely on their word that the exchange is trustworthy. If exchanges are allowed to repeatedly tell us we can rely on their trading platform, fail at securing it, then be given a blank check to remove funds from anyone they desire to make themselves whole again, no exchange has any incentive to secure themselves.   3)  The precedent they&#39;re setting here cannot be maintained.  Exactly what happened here may never be fully known, but according to Mt Gox an unauthorized user accessed someone&#39;s account and placed a sell order. Passwords get guessed/leaked all the time, and any exchange that attempts to undo that in every case will undoubtably fail.   If I&#39;m careless with my password and someone places orders on my behalf in my account without my permission, will Mt Gox revert an hour&#39;s worth of trading to fix it? What if I only had 2 bitcoins? Or 20? or 200? There is no way rolling back trades to handle a compromised password in any way that will scale to the size of bitcoin&#39;s current economy. Unless Mt Gox is wiling to explicitly say they&#39;ll give this same treatment to any user who has their account compromised, it&#39;s blatantly unfair to everyone else.   This also opens the door to allowing anyone to request equal treatment if they made some trades they later regret. Log in through a proxy to make it seem like someone from a distant country was using your account, make your trades, then later scream about how your account was compromised and you want a do-over.   4)  The whole situation seems fishy once you know everything thats been made public.  Mt Gox&#39;s story is requiring extreme leaps of faith to believe. They have insisted that only one account was accessed. This means they expect us to believe:  \u00a0* A Mt Gox user had more than 500,000 bitcoins stored in their Mt Gox account (more than $8 million by Sunday&#39;s prices). \u00a0* This user chose a password that was able to be guessed by a password cracker from the encrypted hash of their pass. (This means their password was likely quite simple) \u00a0* This user managed to amass this many bitcoins without being involved in the community enough to hear everyone screaming about the password file being leaked to the world. \u00a0* Mark claimed to me that police reports were filed in less than an hour after Mt Gox&#39;s trading was halted. \u00a0* The decision to roll back trades was announced within minutes of them investigating. \u00a0* Mt Gox&#39;s public statements have been, at best, misleading.  All of this is so implausible that I can&#39;t help but believe we are not being told the whole story. I am  not implying that I believe Mt Gox is acting dishonorably, but that if they don&#39;t respond to this sort of thing, people will start jumping to worse conclusions.  If I had $8 million worth of easily convertible currency, there is absolutely no way I would store it on a public website like Mt Gox, no matter how secure I believed it was. If I had to store that much there, even temporarily, I would use a password so long it would make War and Peace look like a Twitter message.   Is the account owner a friend or investor in Mt Gox?\u00a0 The account owner managed to get decisions made and a police report filed faster than I was able to get a response out of Mark. If there is some kind of connection between the account owner at Mt Gox, this needs to be fully disclosed and explained before any actions are taken, or any trust in what Mt Gox does is going to be shattered.  I am not actually accusing Mt Gox of scamming us or anything, but asking their users to accept over 500,000 BTC in orders to be reversed due to a story that has some serious holes in it, greatly benefits an anonymous account holder, and has some elements that are provably false is simply unacceptable.   5)  Claims that they want to revert to protect the market are false.  Again, unless there are major pieces of the story missing, the hacker has already gotten away with whatever they were going to. Secure the compromised account with a better password and that matter is closed.  Mt Gox&#39;s website was severely affected by the large sell order, very very few new sell orders made it into the system. A few people did get some panic sells in during the freefall, but they were tiny in comparison to the volume of the big sell that started the mess.  The majority of the &#34;buy&#34; orders that got executed were long standing buy orders that were already in the system. Those people, before any crash started, told the system of their intent to buy at specific prices, and those agreements were honored. At worst, buyers got exactly what they already agreed to purchase, at best got a good deal.  The market made a 70% recovery within minutes, and was continuing to trend upwards before Mt Gox halted trading and shut their web server down.  The only parties that need to be involved in this are Mt Gox and the original account owner to determine if any unauthorized trades were actually made from their account, and how Mt Gox is going to make it up to them.   6)  Mt Gox has several options before them, and are choosing to screw over the community to protect their profit.  I&#39;ve seen people throwing around three options:  Option 1: Rollback all trades.  + The guy who chose to store $8m in bitcoins on a public website gets the majority of his money back + Mt Gox is out very little ? Sellers who placed a panic sell during the freefall get a free undo. - This sets a precedent that trades can be reversed, which increases risk and will likely result in some players want to wait for their trades to &#34;clear&#34; before taking further action making us no better than using PayPal. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Buyers who had both new and long time orders that were executed are getting them revoked by a policy that didn&#39;t exist yesterday. - Had I not decided to &#34;do the right thing&#34; and leave the funds in Mt Gox, this wouldn&#39;t even be an option.  Option 2: Mt Gox tells the account owner &#34;tough luck&#34; and does nothing.  + Everyone else who placed orders will be unaffected - The account owner that got hacked is facing massive losses from something that may have not been completely their fault. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Mt Gox ends up earning their trading fees off someone&#39;s loss that they were likely partially or fully responsible for.  Option 3: Mt Gox takes responsibility, and reimburses the original account owner&#39;s account to the best of their ability.  + The exchange is forced to deal with the consequences of their negligent lapse in security + Faith in the trading market would be largely restored if not increased + Buyers who placed orders that were executed get what they paid for + Mt Gox has clearly made several times more revenue (through trading fees) than this incident would cost them to completely absorb. + If this became an expected feature of an exchange, only exchanges that actually protected our accounts would survive. + Mt Gox is the only party that can go after the auditor that they are claiming was responsible for this incident - It is uncertain if Mt Gox actually has that much liquid reserve to do this fully.  I am publicly asking Mt Gox to explain why they are unwilling to go for Option 3. They&#39;re choosing the option that costs them the least, protecting this mystery user at the expense of the entire bitcoin community. Their decision will result it everyone refusing to keep balances in the exchange for fear that profitable trades will be lost at the whim of the exchange owner. You&#39;ve heard my story, if you make a sudden windfall trade that nets you a good profit, how long are you going to let Mt Gox hold onto it, out of fear they&#39;re going to claim it was invalid? If everyone is doing this, where is the money going to come from to make trades?   I realize a lot of this is going to fall on deaf ears who think Im only doing this for my own profit. Id believe this no matter what, but I probably wouldnt be fighting so passionately if I didnt have some stake in it.  I made a bunch of attempts to try to come up with some kind of mutually agreed on plan with the Mt Gox people, only to get stalled (they won&#39;t even talk to me until I sent them notarized copies of my photo ID on a Sunday?). I&#39;d like to end as much uncertainty as I can, so this is my side. We all have opportunities to totally disrupt the market. I could threaten legal action which would cause an even bigger run on their reserves. Mt Gox could close their doors and take everyone&#39;s cash. I could have drained the money from Mt Gox but didn&#39;t.

Of the 139 million Americans who have become fully vaccinated since December, a mere 3,459 (0.000024 per cent)  have suffered a serious COVID-19 infection in spite of vaccination.\n    The couple were leaving a state of 10 million people that was now counting  record-low case rates of only 300 infections per day. Comprehensive infection data from Israel, meanwhile, has shown that people like the Floridas are now  94 per cent less likely to transmit the virus to others. And on top of everything, they both showed up at the border with negative COVID-19 test results.\n    The Government of Canada did not care. The couple was forced into mandatory 14-day home quarantine and supervised by \u201c10 or 20\u201d phone calls per day from quarantine officers \u2014 as well as regular in-person visits.\n  It seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest\n  \u201cIt seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest,\u201d Florida told the National Post.\n  Florida is but one of thousands of people now caught in a latticework of Canadian COVID-19 restrictions that have ceased to have any relationship to reality. As COVID-19 goes into full retreat across the country, Canadian governments are stubbornly adhering to restrictions that are not only pointless, but incur a daily tithe of debt, closed businesses and lockdown-related fatalities. At a time when Canada should be casting off the shackles of one of its most damaging single events,\u00a0 entrenched interests seem bent on seeing it continue.\n  . @ranaflorida &amp; I just got a visit from Canadian public health authorities checking on our quarantine. We are now being observed doing our Day 8 online Covid test. We are both fully vaccinated. Is it crazy to think such precious public health resources could be put to better use\n\u2014 Richard Florida (@Richard_Florida)  June 16, 2021\n    On Thursday,  only 12 people in Canada died from COVID-19. For context, in a typical year 19 Canadians  can be expected to die every day from flu or pneumonia. In that same average day, 17 will die of Alzheimers, 38 will be killed in accidents and 11 will die by suicide.\n    In much of the country, the risks from COVID-19 have now been definitively outstripped by Canada\u2019s other public health emergency: the opioid crisis. Two Albertans died of COVID-19 on Thursday. By contrast, in just the first two months of 2021 Alberta saw an  average of four fatal overdoses per day.\n    Canada now has one of the lowest rates of per-capita COVID-19 fatalities in the entire G20. At the end of this week, the average citizen of the European Union is now  61 per cent more likely to die of COVID-19 than the average Canadian, even though the case rates in both places are  roughly the same. And while the rise of the Delta variant has spurred worry, it is proving to be just as resilient to vaccination as any other strain of COVID-19.\n  COVID-free for the first time since March 26, 2020! \ud83c\udf89 This is the first time the MSICU at Toronto General does not have any COVID patients. We are very grateful for the extraordinary MSICU team!  #ThankYou  pic.twitter.com/LGmNsF8snY\n\u2014 University Health Network (@UHN)  June 16, 2021\n    On every front, Canada\u2019s pandemic is speeding towards its end: A fast-tracked and innovative national  vaccine strategy has bought Canadians deliverance from COVID-19 faster than almost anyone thought possible.\n  The country now has the world\u2019s second-highest rate of first-dose vaccine coverage, and 4.8 million people are now fully vaccinated \u2014  including half of all Canadians over the age of 80.\n  The country\u2019s reward for this epidemiological miracle? A continued lockdown on commerce and civic life that, in many ways, is indistinguishable from the summer of 2020, when a vaccine still seemed a distant pipe dream and more than two thirds of the country\u2019s 26,000 COVID fatalities had yet to die.\n    For more than a year, schools have been identified around the world as negligible vectors for COVID-19 transmission, in large part because the virus  has such a hard time sticking to children. Regardless, Ontario schools have remained under indefinite closure since April, despite  even a May 29 statement from Ontario\u2019s own COVID-19 Science Advisory Table saying that the province \u201ccan re-open schools safely.\u201d\n    The Government of Ontario had promised that as soon as 70 per cent of adults reached first-dose vaccination, the province would legalize hair salons, outdoor amusements and tables of up to six people at outdoor restaurants \u2014 all of which have been allowed for months in many other regions of North America. Even with Ontario now at 75 per cent vaccination coverage, a government-mandated interval of three weeks means that hair salons will continue to remain shuttered until July.\n  \u201cEvery single \u2026 hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever,\u201d Dan Kelly, CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, wrote in a Thursday Tweet.\n  Every single day, hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever. Yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the capacity for small firms to hang on is extremely limited.\n\u2014 Dan Kelly (@CFIB)  June 17, 2021\n    But the most overzealous COVID strictures can be found at the Canadian border. The federal government  has put in plans to lift its mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers \u2014 but not until July. And even then, incoming travellers must continue to provide two negative COVID-19 tests regardless of vaccination status \u2014 a requirement well beyond the pale of almost any other Western nation.\n  As a renowned urban theorist, Florida can usually be heard talking up his adoptive Toronto home as a haven for what he calls the \u201ccreative class\u201d \u2014 the scientists, engineers, tech investors and others who help invigorate urban economies.\n  Now, as Florida\u2019s usual world of conferences, summits and book tours start up again, he  faces fines and even jail time if he so much as steps outside for a walk before his quarantine ends on Tuesday. He suspects he\u2019s not the only one thinking hard about whether it\u2019s still possible for him to do his job from Canadian soil.\n  Yup same story, we are on day 13 of quarantine and tomorrow is our last day.  An official actually showed up on day 7. He agreed with us that it is pointless we are quarantining despite being fully vaccinated (and 2 negative tests), but he is just doing his job \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2014 Avinash Collis (@avi_collis)  June 15, 2021\n    \u201cThis is literally like hanging out a sign and saying \u2018global talent, we\u2019re kind of on the fence about you,\u2019\u201d he told the National Post.\n  Canada\u2019s hesitance on reopening also risks leaving whole sectors of the economy out of the global rebound, including the country\u2019s  $100 billion-per-year tourism industry. As early as February, Poland lifted its quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated tourists. France opened its borders to vaccinated visitors earlier this month. As of this writing,  more than 30 countries are jumpstarting their tourism industries with special provisions for vaccinated travellers \u2014 particularly those from the heavily vaccinated U.S.\n  Canada, by contrast, just extended its non-essential travel ban with the U.S.  until at least July 21, ostensibly to keep \u201cCanadians safe,\u201d according to a statement by Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair. The borders similarly remain closed to everyone else looking to take a Canadian vacation, regardless of their vaccination status. \u201cYou can\u2019t enter Canada for discretionary travel,\u201d reads a blunt declaration on the Government of Canada\u2019s  official information page for foreign visitors.\n  Our number one priority as we fight  #COVID19 is keeping Canadians safe. In coordination with the U.S., we are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel and with the United States until July 21st, 2021.\n\u2014 Bill Blair (@BillBlair)  June 18, 2021\n    Not only is this shutting out yet another summer for Canada\u2019s bankruptcy-plagued tourism sector, but it risks permanently altering long-established travel patterns. Canada\u2019s refusal to reopen its ports to even fully vaccinated cruise vessels, for instance, has spurred a legislative push in the U.S. to encourage cruise operators to  bypass Canadian ports permanently.\n  \u201cCanada\u00a0cannot afford to be left behind as other countries around the world begin to reopen,\u201d Susie Grynol, president of the Hotel Association of\u00a0Canada,  said in a statement this week.\n  But while overzealous Canadian lockdowns may be progressively losing touch with scientific evidence, it would be wrong to say that they\u2019re necessarily against public opinion.\n    A  June 9 poll by Maru Public Opinion found that 69 per cent of Ontarians approved of school closures. And despite living within North America\u2019s most locked-down jurisdiction, half approved of the performance of Premier Doug Ford. An Angus Reid Institute poll released the same day wasn\u2019t nearly as warm towards Ford, but it nevertheless found that Ontarians  approved of his performance on COVID more than any other single file, including the economy, healthcare and education.\n  As the U.S. crawls out of its pandemic, American communities have reached out to Canadians with a wave of good neighbourliness. Communities in Alaska, Montana and Washington State have even offered extra vaccine doses to Canadian towns across the border to speed up reopening.\n  The Blackfeet Nation in Montana gifted their surplus COVID-19 vaccines (750 doses) to nearby residents in Alberta, Canada.  People drove for hours and lined up for miles on the highway to be vaccinated at a mobile clinic set up at the border crossing.  pic.twitter.com/7gdjVYvT9F\n\u2014 CeeJay Yellow Hawk (@AdriftAlchemist)  May 2, 2021\n    Canadians, in contrast, have seemed unusually willing to seal off outsiders for as long as possible. Last month, Ontario premier Doug Ford said his province could not afford to watch the fourth wave of COVID-19 \u201c walk across\u00a0our\u00a0border.\u201d Last July in B.C., following a rash of vandalism on cars bearing U.S. licence plates, Premier John Horgan told Americans that if they didn\u2019t like it  they should ride the bus.
