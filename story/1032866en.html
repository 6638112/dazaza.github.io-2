He wanted to get away, maybe from something and maybe from everything. He didn’t bring a phone; he didn’t bring a credit card. He didn’t even really bring a name. Or at least he didn’t tell anyone he met what it was.</p><p>2017年4月，一名男子开始在纽约市北部的一个州立公园徒步旅行。他想要逃离，也许是远离一些东西，也可能是远离一切。他没有带电话；他没有带信用卡。他甚至连名字都没带来。或者至少他没告诉任何人他见过的是什么。</p><p> He did bring a giant backpack, which his fellow hikers considered far too heavy for his journey. And he brought a notebook, in which he would scribble notes about  Screeps, an online programming game. The Appalachian Trail runs through the area, and he started walking south, moving slowly but steadily down through Pennsylvania and Maryland. He told people he met along the way that he had worked in the tech industry and he wanted to detox from digital life. Hikers sometimes acquire trail names, pseudonyms they use while deep in the woods. He was “Denim” at first, because he had started his trek in jeans. Later, it became “Mostly Harmless,” which is how he described himself one night at a campfire. Maybe, too, it was a reference to Douglas Adams’  The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy. Early in the series, a character discovers that Earth is defined by a single word in the guide:  harmless. Another character puts in 15 years of research and then adds the adverb. Earth is now “mostly harmless.”</p><p>他确实带了一个巨大的背包，其他徒步旅行者认为这个背包对他的旅行来说太重了。他还带了一本笔记本，上面写着关于在线编程游戏“爬虫”(Screep)的笔记。阿巴拉契亚小径穿过这个地区，他开始向南走，缓慢而稳定地穿过宾夕法尼亚州和马里兰州。他告诉沿途遇到的人，他曾在科技行业工作，他想从数字生活中戒毒。徒步旅行者有时会取小径的名字，这是他们在森林深处使用的化名。起初他是“牛仔裤”，因为他穿着牛仔裤开始了他的长途跋涉。后来，它变得“几乎是无害的”，这是他有一天晚上在篝火上这样形容自己的。也许这也是指道格拉斯·亚当斯的“搭便车的银河系指南”(the Pitchhiker‘s Guide to the Galaxy)。在该系列的早期，一个角色发现地球是由指南中的一个词定义的：无害。另一个人物花了15年的时间研究，然后加上了副词。地球现在“基本上是无害的”。</p><p> By summer, the hiker was in Virginia, where he walked about a hundred miles with a 66-year-old woman who went by the trail name  Obsidian. She taught him how to make a fire, and he told her he was eager to see a bear. On December 1, Mostly Harmless had made it to northern Georgia, where he stopped in a store called Mountain Crossings. A veteran hiker named Matt Mason was working that day, and the two men started talking. Mostly Harmless said that he wanted to figure out a path down to the Florida Keys. Mason told him about a route and a map he could download to his phone. “I don’t have a phone,” Mostly Harmless replied. Describing the moment, Mason remembers thinking, “Oh, this guy’s awesome.” Everyone who goes into the woods is trying to get away from something. But few people have the commitment to cut their digital lifelines as they put on their boots.</p><p>到了夏天，这位徒步旅行者来到了弗吉尼亚州，在那里他和一名66岁的女子步行了大约100英里，这名女子的步道名为黑曜石。她教他如何生火，他告诉她他渴望看到一只熊。12月1日，大多数无害的人到达了佐治亚州北部，在那里他在一家名为Mountain Crosings的商店停了下来。那天，一位名叫马特·梅森(Matt Mason)的资深徒步旅行者正在工作，两人开始交谈。大多无害的人说他想找出一条通往佛罗里达群岛的路。梅森告诉他一条路线和一张地图，他可以下载到他的手机上。“我没有电话，”大多是无害的回答。在描述那一刻时，梅森记得当时他在想，“哦，这家伙太棒了。”每个走进树林的人都在试图躲避什么东西。但很少有人承诺在穿上靴子时切断自己的数字生命线。</p><p>  Mason printed the 60 pages of the map and sold it to Mostly Harmless for $5 cash, which the hiker pulled from a wad of bills that Mason remembers being an inch thick. Mason loves hikers who are a little bit different, a little bit strange. He asked Mostly Harmless if he could  take a picture. Mostly Harmless hesitated but then agreed. He then left the shop and went on his way. Two weeks later, Mason heard from a friend in Alabama who had seen Mostly Harmless hiking through a snowstorm. “He was out there with a smile on his face, walking south,” Mason recalls.</p><p>梅森打印了60页地图，并以5美元的现金将其卖给了几乎无害的人，徒步旅行者从梅森记得有一英寸厚的一叠钞票中拿出了这张地图。梅森喜欢有点不同，有点奇怪的徒步旅行者。他问他是否可以拍一张照片，这几乎是无害的。大多数情况下都是无害的，犹豫了一下，然后同意了。然后他离开了商店，继续上路。两周后，梅森收到了阿拉巴马州一位朋友的来信，他看到在暴风雪中徒步旅行几乎是无害的。梅森回忆说：“他脸上挂着微笑，朝南走着。”</p><p>  By the last week of January, he was in northern Florida, walking on the side of Highway 90, when a woman named Kelly Fairbanks pulled over to say hello. Fairbanks is what is known as a “trail angel,” someone who helps out through-hikers who pass near her, giving them food and access to a shower if they want. She was out looking for a different hiker when she saw Mostly Harmless. She pulled over, and they started to chat. He said that he had started in New York and was heading down to Key West. She asked if he was using the Florida Trail App, and he responded that he didn’t have a phone.</p><p>到了1月的最后一周，他正在佛罗里达州北部走在90号高速公路的一侧，这时一位名叫凯利·费尔班克斯(Kelly Fairbanks)的女子靠边停车打招呼。费尔班克斯是被称为“步道天使”的人，他会帮助从她附近经过的徒步旅行者，如果他们愿意的话，给他们食物和淋浴的机会。她当时正在外面寻找另一个徒步旅行者，这时她发现几乎没有伤害。她把车停在路边，他们开始聊天。他说他已经从纽约出发，正前往基韦斯特。她问他是否在使用佛罗里达小径应用程序，他回答说他没有手机。</p><p>  Fairbanks took notice of his gear—which was a mix of high-end and generic, including his  black-and-copper trekking poles. And she was struck by his rugged, lonely look. “He had very kind eyes. I saw the huge beard first and thought, ‘It’s an older guy.’ But his eyes were so young, and he didn’t have crow&#39;s feet. I realized he was a lot younger.” She was concerned though, the way she used to be concerned about her two younger brothers. The trail could be confusing, and it wouldn’t be long before everything started getting intolerably hot and muggy. “I remembered him because I was worried,” she added.</p><p>费尔班克斯注意到了他的装备-这是高端和普通的混合，包括他的黑铜相间的徒步旅行杆。她被他粗犷、孤独的表情打动了。“他有一双非常善良的眼睛。我首先看到了那大胡子，心想，“是个年纪大一点的家伙。”但是他的眼睛太年轻了，而且他没有鱼尾纹。我意识到他要年轻得多。“。不过，她很担心，就像她过去担心她的两个弟弟一样。这条小径可能会让人感到困惑，不久之后，一切都开始变得令人无法忍受的炎热和闷热。“我记得他，因为我很担心，”她补充说。</p><p>  Six months later and 600 miles south, on July 23, 2018, two hikers headed out into the Big Cypress National Preserve. The humidity was oppressive, but they trudged forward, crossing swamps, tending aching feet, and dodging the alligators and snakes. About 10 miles into their journey, they stopped to rest their feet at a place called Nobles Camp. There they saw a yellow tent and a pair of boots outside. Something smelled bad, and something seemed off. They called out, then peered through the tent’s windscreen. An emaciated, lifeless body was looking up at them. They called 911.</p><p>六个月后，2018年7月23日，向南600英里，两名徒步旅行者前往大柏树国家保护区。潮湿令人窒息，但他们艰难地向前走，穿过沼泽，照顾疼痛的脚，躲避鳄鱼和蛇。行程大约10英里后，他们在一个叫贵族营地的地方停下来休息。在那里，他们看到外面有一个黄色的帐篷和一双靴子。有什么东西闻起来很难闻，而且好像有什么不对劲。他们喊了一声，然后从帐篷的挡风玻璃往外看。一具消瘦、死气沉沉的身体正抬头看着他们。他们打了911。</p><p>  It’s usually easy to put a name to a corpse. There’s an ID or a credit card. There’s been a missing persons report in the area. There’s a DNA match. But the investigators in Collier County couldn’t find a thing. Mostly Harmless’ fingerprints didn’t show up in any law enforcement database. He hadn’t served in the military, and his fingerprints didn’t match those of anyone else on file. His DNA didn’t match any in the Department of Justice’s missing person database or in CODIS, the national DNA database run by the FBI. A picture of his face didn’t turn up anything in a facial recognition database. The body had no distinguishing tattoos.</p><p>给身体取名字通常很容易。有身份证或信用卡。该地区有一份失踪人口报告。有一个DNA匹配。但科里尔县的调查人员什么也没找到。几乎无害的指纹没有出现在任何执法数据库中。他没有在军队服役，他的指纹与档案上其他任何人的指纹都不匹配。他的DNA与司法部失踪的PER中的任何一个都不匹配</p><p> Nor could investigators understand how or why he died. There were no indications of foul play, and he had more than $3,500 cash in the tent. He had food nearby, but he was hollowed out, weighing just 83 pounds on a 5&#39;8&#34; frame. Investigators put his age in the vague range between 35 and 50, and they couldn’t point to any abnormalities. The only substances he tested positive for were ibuprofen and an antihistamine. His cause of death, according to the autopsy report, was “undetermined.” He had, in some sense, just wasted away. But why hadn’t he tried to find help? Almost immediately, people compared Mostly Harmless to Chris McCandless, whose story was the subject of  Into the Wild. McCandless, though, had been stranded in the Alaska bush, trapped by a raging river as he ran out of food. He died on a school bus, starving, desperate for help,  22 miles of wilderness separating him from a road. Mostly Harmless was just 5 miles from a major highway. He left no note, and there was no evidence that he had spent his last days calling out for help.</p><p>调查人员也无法理解他是如何或为什么死亡的。没有谋杀的迹象，他帐篷里有超过3500美元的现金。他在附近有食物，但是他被掏空了，体重只有83磅，身躯5#39；8&34；调查人员认为他的年龄在35岁到50岁之间，没有发现任何异常。他唯一检测呈阳性的物质是布洛芬和一种抗组胺药物。根据尸检报告，他的死因“尚未确定”。从某种意义上说，他只是虚度年华。但他为什么不试着寻求帮助呢？几乎立刻，人们就将其与克里斯·麦克坎德利斯(Chris McCandless)相提并论，后者的故事是“荒野”(Into The Wild)的主题。然而，麦克坎德利斯被困在阿拉斯加灌木丛中，由于食物耗尽，他被一条汹涌的河流困住了。他死在一辆校车上，饥饿，绝望地寻求帮助，22英里的荒野将他与一条道路隔开。基本上无害，距离一条主要高速公路只有5英里。他没有留下字条，也没有证据表明他在生命的最后几天里一直在呼救。</p><p> Sign up for our  Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.</p><p>注册我们的Longreads时事通讯，从“连线”获得最好的功能、想法和调查。</p><p> The investigators were stumped. To find out what had happened, they needed to learn who he was. So the Florida Department of Law Enforcement drew up an image of Mostly Harmless, and the Collier County investigators shared it with the public. In the sketch, his mouth is open wide, and his eyes too. He has a gray and black beard, with a bare patch of skin right below the mouth. His teeth, as noted in the autopsy, are perfect, suggesting he had good dental care as a child. He looks startled but also oddly pleased, as if he’s just seen a clown jump out from behind a curtain. The image started to circulate online along with  other pictures from his campsite, including his tent and his hiking poles.</p><p>调查人员被难住了。为了找出发生了什么，他们需要知道他是谁。因此，佛罗里达州执法部门绘制了一张几乎无害的图像，科利尔县的调查人员将其与公众分享。在素描中，他的嘴巴张得很大，眼睛也睁得很大。他留着灰黑色的胡须，嘴巴正下方有一块裸露的皮肤。尸检发现，他的牙齿完好无损，这表明他小时候受到了良好的牙齿护理。他看起来很吃惊，但也很奇怪地高兴，就像他刚刚看到一个小丑从窗帘后面跳出来一样。这张照片开始和他营地的其他照片一起在网上流传，包括他的帐篷和徒步旅行杆。</p><p>  Kelly Fairbanks works at the Army and Air Force exchange store on a Florida military base. She normally monitors the CCTV cameras for shoplifters, but if there’s no one in the store she might sneak a look at Facebook. It was a quiet moment, and suddenly the picture popped into her feed. There  he was: eyes wide open and looking up. She recognized the eyes and the beard. “I started freaking out,” she says. It was the kind man she’d seen on Highway 90. The sheriff’s office had also posted a photo of the hiker’s poles, and Fairbanks knew she had an image of the same man holding the same gear.</p><p>凯利·费尔班克斯在佛罗里达州军事基地的陆军和空军交流商店工作。她通常会监控闭路电视摄像头是否有商店扒手，但如果商店里没有人，她可能会偷偷看一眼Facebook。那是一个安静的时刻，突然，这张照片弹出到了她的信息源中。他就在那里：眼睛睁得大大的，抬起头来。她认出了那双眼睛和胡须。“我开始抓狂了，”她说。这是她在90号高速公路上见过的那个善良的人。警长办公室还发布了一张徒步旅行者杆子的照片，费尔班克斯知道她有一张同一个男人手持相同装备的照片。</p><p> She clicked right over to the Collier County Sheriff’s Facebook page and sent in two photographs she had taken of Mostly Harmless. She got a message back immediately asking for her phone number. Soon a detective was on the line asking, “What can you tell me?”</p><p>她点击了科里尔县警长的Facebook页面，并上传了两张她拍摄的几乎无害的照片。她立即收到一条信息，询问她的电话号码。不久，一名侦探在电话里问道：“你能告诉我什么？”</p><p> She told him everything she knew. And she shared the original post, and her photo, all over Facebook. Soon there were dozens of people jumping in. They had seen the hiker too. They had journeyed with him for a few hours or a few days. They had sat at a campfire with him. There was a GoPro  video in which he appeared. People remembered him talking about a sister in either Sarasota or Saratoga. They thought he had said he was from near Baton Rouge. One person remembered that he ate a lot of sticky buns; another said that he loved ketchup. But no one knew his name. When the body of Chris McCandless was found in the wilds of Alaska in the summer of 1992 without any identification, it took authorities only two weeks to figure out his identity. A friend in South Dakota, who’d known McCandless as “Alex,” heard a discussion of the story on AM radio and called the authorities. Clues followed quickly, and McCandless’ family was soon found.</p><p>她把她知道的一切都告诉了他。她在Facebook上分享了最初的帖子和她的照片。很快就有几十个人跳了进去。他们也看到了徒步旅行者。他们和他一起旅行了几个小时或几天。他们和他一起坐在篝火旁。有一段GoPro视频，他出现在其中。人们记得他谈到过萨拉索塔或萨拉托加的一个姐妹。他们认为他说他来自巴吞鲁日附近。一个人记得他吃了很多粘包；另一个人说他喜欢番茄酱。但是没有人知道他的名字。1992年夏天，当克里斯·麦克坎德利斯(Chris McCandless)的身体在阿拉斯加的荒野中被发现时，没有任何身份证明，当局只花了两周时间就查明了他的身份。南达科他州的一位朋友，他叫麦克坎德利斯为“亚历克斯”，在AM广播中听到了关于这个故事的讨论，于是打电话给当局。线索很快就接踵而至，麦坎德利斯的家人很快就被找到了。</p><p>  Now it’s 2020, and we have the internet. Facebook knows you’re pregnant almost before you do. Amazon knows your light bulb is going to go out right before it does. Put details on Twitter  about a stolen laptop and people will track down the thief in a Manhattan bar. The internet can decode  family mysteries, identify  long-forgotten songs, solve  murders, and, as this magazine showed a decade ago, track down almost anyone who tries to  shed their digital skin. This case seemed easy.</p><p>现在是2020年，我们有了互联网。Facebook几乎在你之前就知道你怀孕了。亚马逊知道你的灯泡会在熄灭之前熄灭。将一台被盗笔记本电脑的详细信息发布到Twitter上，人们就会在曼哈顿的一家酒吧里追捕到这名小偷。互联网可以破解家庭秘密，识别被遗忘已久的歌曲，破解谋杀案，正如这本杂志10年前所展示的那样，几乎可以追踪任何试图摆脱数字皮肤的人。这个案子看起来很简单。</p><p>  An avid  Facebook group committed to figuring out his identity soon formed.  Reddit threads popped up to analyze the notes he had taken for  Screeps. Amateur detectives tracked down leads and tried to match photographs in missing persons databases. A  massive timeline was constructed on Websleuths.com. Was it possible, one  Dr. Oz viewer asked, that Mostly Harmless was a boy featured on the show who went missing in 1982? Was it possible that Mostly Harmless was a suspect in Arkansas who had murdered his girlfriend in 2017? None of the photos matched.</p><p>一个狂热的Facebook小组致力于查明他的身份，很快就成立了。Reddit上的帖子突然冒出来，分析他为斯克里普斯做的笔记。业余侦探追查线索，并试图与失踪人口数据库中的照片进行匹配。Websleuths.com上构建了一个巨大的时间线。奥兹博士的一位观众问道，有没有可能，节目中出现的一个1982年失踪的男孩基本上是无害的？有没有可能阿肯色州的一名嫌疑人在2017年谋杀了他的女朋友，基本上是无害的？没有一张照片匹配。</p><p> The story pulled people in. Everyone, at some point, has wanted to put their phone in a garbage can and head off with a fake name and a wad of cash. Here was someone who had done it and who seemed to have so much going for him: He was kind, charming, educated. He knew how to code. And yet he had died alone in a yellow tent. Maybe he had been chased by demons and had sought an ending like this. Or maybe he had just been outmatched by the wilderness and the Florida heat.</p><p>这个故事吸引了很多人。在某种程度上，每个人都想把手机扔进垃圾桶，然后带着假名字和一叠现金离开。这是一个做过这件事的人，而且似乎对他有很多好处：他善良，有魅力，受过教育。他知道如何编写代码。然而，他却孤独地死在一个黄色的帐篷里。也许他曾被恶魔追赶，并寻求过这样的结局。或者，也许他只是被荒野和佛罗里达的炎热所击败。</p><p> It just wasn’t a normal story in any way. And, as Fairbanks said, “he was a good-looking dude,” which, she notes, might explain why so many of the searchers are women. In mid-October, one woman in the Facebook group posted a slideshow comparing his photos  to those of Brad Pitt. “Actually I think MH looks better. 😉,” one commenter wrote.</p><p>不管怎么说，这都不是一个正常的故事。而且，正如费尔班克斯所说，“他是个英俊的家伙”，她指出，这可能解释了为什么这么多搜索者是女性。10月中旬，Facebook群中的一名女性发布了一张幻灯片，将他的照片与布拉德·皮特(Brad Pitt)的照片进行了比较。“事实上，我认为MH看起来更好。😉，“一位评论者写道。</p><p>  The dude, though, seemed to have followed, to near perfection, the hiker credo of “Leave no trace.” None of the clues panned out. Nothing actually got people close to solving the mystery. An industrious writer named Jason Nark spent more than a year obsessively tracking down leads and then  wrote  an elegy to the hiker that began, “Sometimes I imagine him falling through space, drifting like dust from dead stars in the vast nowhere above us.”</p><p>不过，这家伙似乎近乎完美地遵循了徒步旅行者“不留痕迹”的信条。所有的线索都没有查出结果。实际上，没有任何东西能让人们接近解开这个谜团。一位名叫杰森·纳克(Jason Nark)的勤奋作家花了一年多的时间痴迷地追查线索，然后写了一首挽歌给这位徒步旅行者，开始时他写了一首挽歌：“有时我想象他从太空中坠落，像尘埃一样从我们头顶上广袤无垠的死星上飘落。”</p><p> Natasha Teasley manages a canoe and kayak company in North Carolina. As business slowed when the coronavirus hit, she started to spend more time online, and she started to fill the gap in her life with the hunt for Mostly Harmless. She sent flyers to the Chambers of Commerce in every city where people thought he might have come from, including Sarasota, Florida, and Saratoga Springs, New York. She tracked down details about every car that was towed out of Harriman State Park, where he likely started his journey. She scoured missing persons databases. I asked her what motivated her to spend so much time looking for a man she’d never met. She responded achingly, “He’s got to be missed. Someone must miss this guy.”</p><p>娜塔莎·蒂斯利(Natasha Teasley)在北卡罗来纳州管理着一家独木舟和皮划艇公司。当冠状病毒来袭时，随着生意的放缓，她开始花更多的时间上网，她开始用寻找几乎无害的东西来填补生活中的空白。她向人们认为他可能来自的每个城市的商会发了传单，包括佛罗里达州的萨拉索塔和纽约的萨拉托加斯普林斯。她追踪了从哈里曼州立公园拖出来的每辆车的细节，他很可能就是从那里开始他的旅程的。她搜索了失踪人口数据库。我问她是什么驱使她花这么多时间寻找一个她从未谋面的男人。她痛苦地回答说，“一定会想念他的。一定有人怀念这个家伙。“。</p><p> When we think of DNA tests, we normally think of their miraculous ability to give us a yes or a no. The unique thread of base pairs that make us who we are exists in every cell. So we take the genetic information found at a crime scene, or in the saliva on a coffee cup, or on the hand of a deceased hiker. Then we look closely at roughly 20 chunks, or what geneticists call markers, and we search in a database of collected samples to see whether the markers match. Imagine if a book, 1 million pages long but without a cover, washed up on the shore. And then imagine you could scan one page and search all the books in a giant database to see if that exact page appeared. That’s conventional DNA testing.</p><p>当我们想到DNA测试时，我们通常会想到它们神奇的能力，可以给我们一个是或不是的答案。造就我们的独特碱基对线索存在于每个细胞中。所以我们提取在犯罪现场发现的基因信息，或者咖啡杯上的唾液中，或者已故徒步旅行者手上的基因信息。然后我们仔细观察大约20块，或者遗传学家所说的标记，然后我们在收集的样本数据库中搜索，看看这些标记是否匹配。想象一下，如果一本长达100万页但没有封面的书被冲上了海岸。然后想象一下，你可以扫描一页，在一个巨大的数据库中搜索所有书籍，看看是否出现了确切的页面。这是常规的DNA检测。</p><p>  But DNA also can tell the story of human history. By running a different kind of test, you get beyond yes or no and into a million variations of maybe. The genetic markers in your body are closer to those of your first cousin than your third. And they’re closer to those of your third cousin than your sixth. There’s a little bit of each generation in each of us, from our parents to our great grandparents to the chimpanzees and bonobos of the forests of Africa. So now imagine that book, and imagine that instead of comparing one page, you could compare everything in the book with everything in all other books, to find similar words, syntax, and themes. You would need complicated math and pattern tracing, but, eventually, you might figure out the author. And so, early in the summer of 2020, the organizers of the Facebook group searching for Mostly Harmless’ identity sent news about the case to a Houston company called Othram. It had been started two years earlier and  pitches itself as a one-stop shop for solving cold cases.</p><p>但是DNA也可以讲述人类历史的故事。通过运行一种不同的测试，你超越了是或否，进入了可能的一百万种变体。你体内的遗传标记更接近你的第一个表亲，而不是你的第三个表亲。比起你的第六个表弟，它们更接近你的第三个表弟。从我们的父母到我们的曾祖父母，再到非洲森林中的黑猩猩和矮黑猩猩，我们每一代人身上都有一点。现在想象一下这本书，想象一下，不是比较一页，而是可以将书中的所有内容与所有其他书籍中的所有内容进行比较，以找到相似的单词、语法和主题。您需要复杂的数学和模式跟踪，但最终您可能会找出作者。因此，在2020年初夏，Facebook这个寻找基本无害身份的小组的组织者向休斯顿一家名为Othram的公司发送了有关此案的消息。它成立于两年前，并将自己标榜为破获悬案的一站式商店。</p><p>  Othram’s founder, David Mittelman, is a geneticist who had worked on the original human genome project, and he was drawn to this odd case. The company asks the public for suggestions for mysteries to solve, and that’s one of the best parts of the job. “I like doing the cases from the tip line,” Mittelman told me. “Lab work for the sake of lab work is kind of boring.” If he could crack the hiker’s identity, he’d get attention for his technology. But there was something else, too, drawing him in, a riddle he wanted to answer. The hiker seemed to have found an internet family but had no connection to his real one.</p><p>Othram的创始人David Mittelman是一位遗传学家，他曾参与过最初的人类基因组计划，他被这个奇怪的案例所吸引。该公司征求公众对要解开的谜团的建议，这是这项工作最好的部分之一。米特尔曼告诉我：“我喜欢从小道消息中接手案件。”“为实验室工作而做的实验室工作有点无聊。”如果他能破解徒步旅行者的身份，他的技术就会引起人们的注意。但还有另一件事吸引着他，一个他想要回答的谜题。这位徒步旅行者似乎找到了一个互联网家庭，但与他真正的家人没有任何联系。</p><p> Othram called up the Collier County Sheriff’s Office and offered to help. DNA analysis is expensive, though, and the company estimated that the whole project—from evidence to answers—would cost $5,000. The sheriff&#39;s office couldn&#39;t spend that much money on a case that involved no crime. But it would love Othram’s help if there were another way to pay for the work. And so three of the great trends of modern technology—crowdfunding, amateur sleuthing, and cutting-edge genomics—combined. Within eight days, the Facebook group had  raised the money to run the analysis. Soon a small piece of bone from the hiker was on its way west from Collier County to the Othram labs.</p><p>奥瑟姆打电话给科利尔县警长办公室，表示愿意提供帮助。然而，DNA分析是昂贵的，该公司估计，整个项目-从证据到答案-将耗资5000美元。治安官办公室不能在一个不涉及犯罪的案件上花那么多钱。但如果有另一种方式支付这项工作，它会很乐意得到奥瑟姆的帮助。因此，现代技术的三大趋势-众筹、业余侦探和尖端基因组学-结合在一起。在8天内，Facebook小组就筹集了运行这项分析的资金。不久，徒步旅行者的一小块骨头正往西飞去。</p><p> The first step for Othram’s team was to extract DNA from the bone fragment and to then analyze it to make sure they had enough to proceed. They did, and so they soon put small samples of DNA onto glass slides, which they inserted into a sequencer, a machine that costs roughly a million dollars and  looks like a giant washing machine made by Apple.</p><p>Othram团队的第一步是从骨头碎片中提取DNA，然后进行分析，以确保他们有足够的证据继续进行。他们做到了，所以他们很快就把小样本DNA放到了玻片上，然后把它们放进了测序仪中，测序仪耗资约100万美元，看起来就像苹果公司制造的巨型洗衣机。</p><p> Unfortunately, it’s a washing machine that has a long run cycle. And it doesn’t always work. Sometimes the pages of the book you find are ripped or blurry. Sometimes the process is iterative and you have to tape fragments back together. So, as the sequencer spun, the Facebook hunters fretted that, once again, nothing would come of a promising lead. But by mid-August, Othram had a clean read on the DNA: They knew exactly what combination of As, Cs, Gs, and Ts had combined to create the mysterious hiker. A company spokesperson appeared live on the Facebook group’s page to detail the progress; posters responded with  gratitude and euphoria.</p><p>不幸的是，这是一台运行周期很长的洗衣机。而且它并不总是有效的。有时你会发现书的页面被撕裂或模糊。有时这个过程是迭代的，您必须将片断粘合在一起。因此，随着测序仪的旋转，Facebook的猎人们担心，再一次，没有什么有希望的线索。但到了8月中旬，奥特拉姆对DNA有了一个清晰的解读：他们确切地知道As，Cs，Gs和Ts的组合创造了这个神秘的徒步旅行者。一位公司发言人出现在Facebook小组的页面上，详细说明了进展情况；海报上的人表达了感激之情，并欣喜若狂。</p><p> Science sometimes gets harder with every step, though, and having the sequence was just the beginning. In order to identify Mostly Harmless, the team at Othram would have to compare his genetic information with other people’s. And they would start with a service called GEDMatch, a database of DNA samples that people have submitted, voluntarily, to answer their own hopes and questions—they want to find a lost stepsister or a clue about their grandpa. That collection of DNA has become a cornucopia for law enforcement. Each new sample submitted provides one more book for the library that can be searched and scoured. It was through this technique that investigators in Contra Costa County, California,  found the Golden State Killer in the spring of 2018, connecting a DNA sample of the killer to GEDMatch samples of relatives. Just this past week, Othram helped law enforcement  identify the murderer of a 5-year-old in Missoula, Montana, a case that had gone unsolved for 46 years.</p><p>然而，科学有时会随着每一步的进展而变得更加困难，而有了这个序列只是个开始。为了识别出大部分无害的DNA样本，奥瑟姆的团队必须将他的基因信息与其他人的基因信息进行比较。他们将从一项名为GEDMatch的服务开始，这是一个DNA样本数据库，人们自愿提交这些样本，以回答自己的希望和问题--他们想要找到失踪的同父异母姐妹或关于他们祖父的线索。收集的DNA已经成为执法部门的聚宝盆。每个提交的新样本都会为图书馆提供多一本可以搜索和搜索的书籍。正是通过这种技术，加利福尼亚州孔特拉科斯塔县的调查人员在2018年春天发现了金州杀手，将凶手的DNA样本与GEDMatch的亲属样本进行了连接。就在过去的一周，Othram帮助执法部门查明了蒙大拿州米苏拉一名5岁儿童的凶手，这起案件已经悬而未决46年了。</p><p>  It’s been over a month since Othram started looking through the GEDmatch database. It won’t say anything about what it has found, and the Collier County Sheriff’s Office is keeping quiet as well. But one source outside of the company who is familiar with its progress says that, while Othram doesn’t know Mostly Harmless’ name, it has found enough matching patterns to identify the region of the country from which his ancestor’s hail.</p><p>自从Othram开始搜索GEDMatch数据库已经一个多月了。它没有透露任何关于它的发现，科利尔县警长办公室也保持沉默。但一位熟悉其进展的公司外消息人士表示，尽管Othram并不知道大部分无害的名字，但它已经找到了足够的匹配模式，可以识别出他祖先的冰雹来自这个国家的哪个地区。</p><p> That isn’t sufficient though. Knowing for sure, for example, that his relatives came from Baton Rouge doesn’t mean Mostly Harmless came from Baton Rouge. His parents could have been born there and moved to Montreal. He could have been born in Louisiana and dropped on a doorstep in Maine. But, right now, the data scientists at Othram are combing through all the DNA samples in GEDMatch, looking for patterns and trying to circle closer to his identity. They’re most likely building out a family tree. Let’s say they found someone in GEDMatch whose DNA seems like a fourth cousin of Mostly Harmless, and then perhaps someone who seems like a third cousin. How do those two people connect? Through this sort of slow, painstaking analysis, they can get closer to an answer. Soon they might find his extended family, and then perhaps his parents’ names. And then law enforcement will be able to solve a case that has stumped them for more than two years.</p><p>不过，这还不够。例如，知道他的亲戚来自巴吞鲁日并不意味着大部分无害的人来自巴吞鲁日。他的父母可能在那里出生，然后搬到蒙特利尔。他可能出生在路易斯安那州，然后掉在缅因州的门阶上。但是，现在，Othram的数据科学家正在梳理GEDMatch中的所有DNA样本，寻找模式，并试图接近他的身份。他们很可能是在构建家谱。比方说，他们在GEDMatch中发现了一个人，他的DNA似乎是几乎无害的第四个表亲，然后可能还有一个看起来像第三个表亲的人。这两个人是怎么联系起来的？通过这种缓慢而艰苦的分析，他们可以更接近答案。很快，他们可能会找到他的大家庭，然后也许还会找到他父母的名字。到那时，执法部门将能够破获一起困扰了他们两年多的案件。</p><p> They might get there, and they might not. A source familiar with the work suggests that the earliest we’ll get an answer is December. Unless between now and then, perhaps, someone reading this article or browsing a Facebook group recognizes his face. Or puts together clues that have eluded everyone else. Finally, he won’t be “Mostly Harmless”; he’ll have a real name.</p><p>他们可能会到达那里，也可能不会。一位熟悉这项工作的消息人士表示，我们最早会在12月得到答案。也许，除非从现在到那时，有人在阅读这篇文章或浏览Facebook群时认出了他的脸。或者把其他所有人都不知道的线索拼凑在一起。最后，他不会是“几乎无害的”；他会有一个真实的名字。</p><p>  And then, with that mystery solved, a new one will open up. Why did Mostly Harmless walk into the woods? And why, when things started to go wrong, didn’t he walk out?</p><p>然后，随着这个谜团的解开，一个新的谜团将会打开。为什么大体上无害的人会走进树林？当事情开始出问题的时候，他为什么不离开呢？</p><p> To contact the author of this piece, please send a direct message over  Twitter,  Linkedin, or  Facebook.
