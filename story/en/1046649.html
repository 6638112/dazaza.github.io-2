For a time I experienced difficulty in trying to read it as well as in attempting to write it. My attention span had gone out on me; I no longer had the patience to try to write novels. It&#39;s an involved story, too tedious to talk about here. But I know it has much to do now with why I write poems and short stories. Get in, get out. Don&#39;t linger. Go on. It could be that I lost any great ambitions at about the same time, in my late 20&#39;s. If I did, I think it was good it happened. Ambition and a little luck are good things for a writer to have going for him. Too much ambition and bad luck, or no luck at all, can be killing. There has to be talent.</p><p>1966年，我27岁，是一位讲故事的人，我发现我无法集中精力于长篇叙事小说。有一段时间，我在尝试阅读和写作时遇到困难。我的注意力集中在我身上。我再也没有耐心尝试写小说了。这是一个涉及的故事，太累了，无法在这里谈论。但是我知道现在与为什么我写诗和短篇小说有很大关系。进去，出去。不要绕。继续。可能是我20多岁的同时失去了任何野心。如果我做到了，我认为这是件好事。野心和一点运气对于作家来说是一件好事。野心太大，运气不好，或者根本没有运气，可能会杀死人。必须有才能。</p><p>  Some writers have a bunch of talent; I don&#39;t know any writers who are without it. But a unique and exact way of looking at things, and finding the right context for expressing that way of looking, that&#39;s something else. &#39;&#39;The World According to Garp&#39;&#39; is of course the marvelous world according to John Irving. There is another world according to Flannery O&#39;Connor, and others according to William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. There are worlds according to Cheever, Updike, Singer, Stanley Elkin, Ann Beattie, Cynthia Ozick, Donald Barthelme, Mary Robison, William Kittredge, Barry Hannah. Every great, or even every very good writer, makes the world over according to his own specifications.</p><p>  有些作家有很多才华。我不认识没有它的作家。但是，这是一种独特且准确的方式来查看事物，并找到合适的上下文来表达这种查看方式，这是另一回事。 ＆＃39;根据Garp的世界根据约翰·欧文（John Irving）的说法，这当然是一个了不起的世界。根据弗兰纳里·奥康纳（Flannery O＆Connor）的说法，还有另一个世界，根据威廉·福克纳（William Faulkner）和欧内斯特·海明威（Ernest Hemingway）的说法，还有另一个世界。根据Cheever，Updike，Singer，Stanley Elkin，Ann Beattie，Cynthia Ozick，Donald Barthelme，Mary Robison，William Kittredge和Barry Hannah的说法，存在一些世界。每个伟大的作家，甚至每个非常优秀的作家，都按照自己的规范走向世界。</p><p>  It&#39;s akin to style, what I&#39;m talking about, but it isn&#39;t style alone. It is the writer&#39;s particular and unmistakable signature on everything he writes. It is his world and no other. This is one of the things that distinguishes one writer from another. Not talent. There&#39;s plenty of that around. But a writer who has some special way of looking at things and who gives artistic expression to that way of looking: that writer may be around for a time.</p><p>  这与样式有关，我在说什么，但并非仅样式一种。这是作者在他撰写的所有内容上的独特而明确的签名。这是他的世界，没有别的。这是区分一位作家与另一位作家的事情之一。不是才华。周围有很多东西。但是，一位作家拥有某种特殊的观望方式，并且以这种表达方式表现出艺术表达：这位作家可能会待一段时间。</p><p>  Isak Dinesen said that she wrote a little every day, without hope and without despair. Someday I&#39;ll put that on a three-by-five card and tape it to the wall beside my desk. I have some three-by-five cards on the wall now. &#39;&#39;Fundamental accuracy of statement is the ONE sole morality of writing.&#39;&#39; Ezra Pound. It is not everything by ANY means, but if a writer has &#39;&#39;fundamental accuracy of statement&#39;&#39; going for him, he&#39;s at least on the right track.</p><p>  Isak Dinesen说，她每天写一点，没有希望也没有绝望。有一天，我会把它放在三乘五的卡上，然后用胶带贴在我办公桌旁边的墙上。我现在在墙上有一些三乘五的卡片。 ＆＃39;＆＃39;陈述的基本准确性是写作的唯一道德。以斯拉镑。绝不是任何手段，而是作者具有陈述的基本准确性。为了他，他至少在正确的轨道上。</p><p>  I have a three-by-five up there with this fragment of a sentence from a story by Chekhov: &#39;&#39;... and suddenly everything became clear to him.&#39;&#39; I find these words filled with wonder and possibility. I love their simple clarity, and the hint of revelation that is implied. There is a bit of mystery, too. What has been unclear before? Why is it just now becoming clear? What&#39;s happened? Most of all - what now? There are consequences as a result of such sudden awakenings. I feel a sharp sense of relief - and anticipation.</p><p>  我在那里有五分之三的位置，上面有契Che夫的一个故事的一段句子：＆＃39;＆＃39; ...突然间，一切都变得对他很清楚。我发现这些话充满了惊奇和可能性。我喜欢它们的简单明了，以及暗示的启示。也有一些神秘感。以前不清楚的是什么？为什么现在才变得清楚？发生什么事了？最重要的是-现在呢？这种突然的唤醒会带来后果。我感到非常的宽慰和期待。</p><p>  I overheard the writer Geoffrey Wolff say &#39;&#39;No cheap tricks&#39;&#39; to a group of writing students. That should go on a three-by-five card. I&#39;d amend it a little to &#39;&#39;No tricks.&#39;&#39; Period. I hate tricks. At the first sign of a trick or a gimmick in a piece of fiction, a cheap trick or even an elaborate trick, I tend to look for cover. Tricks are ultimately boring, and I get bored easily, which may go along with my not having much of an attention span. But extremely clever chi-chi writing, or just plain tomfoolery writing, puts me to sleep. Writers don&#39;t need tricks or gimmicks or even necessarily need to be the smartest fellows on the block. At the risk of appearing foolish, a writer sometimes needs to be able to just stand and gape at this or that thing - a sunset or an old shoe - in absolute and simple amazement.</p><p>  我听不到作家杰弗里·沃尔夫（Geoffrey Wolff）说的“便宜招”。给一群写作学生。那应该放在三乘五的卡片上。我将其稍加修改为“绝招”。期。我讨厌花招。在小说中出现花样或花招的第一个迹象时，我倾向于寻找掩饰。技巧最终很无聊，而我很容易感到无聊，这可能与我没有太多注意力的情况有关。但是非常聪明的chi-chi写作，或者仅仅是愚蠢的愚弄行为，使我入睡。作家不需要技巧或头，甚至不需要成为街区上最聪明的家伙。冒着看起来很愚蠢的风险，作家有时需要能够站起来并以绝对和简单的惊奇惊叹于日落或旧鞋之类的东西。</p><p>  Some months ago, in this Book Review, John Barth said that 10 years ago most of the students in his fiction writing seminar were interested in &#39;&#39;formal innovation,&#39;&#39; and this no longer seems to be the case. He&#39;s a little worried that writers are going to start writing mom and pop novels in the 1980&#39;s. He worries that experimentation may be on the way out, along with liberalism. I get a little nervous if I find myself within earshot of somber discussion about &#39;&#39;formal innovation&#39;&#39; in fiction writing. Too often &#39;&#39;experimentation&#39;&#39; is a license to be careless, silly or imitative in the writing. Even worse, a license to try to brutalize or alienate the reader. Too often such writing gives us no news of the world, or else describes a desert landscape and that&#39;s all - a few dunes and lizards here and there, but no people; a place uninhabited by anything recognizably human, a place of interest only to a few scientific specialists.</p><p>  几个月前，约翰·巴特（John Barth）在《书评》中说，十年前，在他的小说写作研讨会上，大多数学生都对“形式创新”感兴趣。而且似乎不再如此。他有点担心作家们将在1980年代开始写妈妈和流行小说。他担心，随着自由主义的到来，实验可能即将到来。如果我发现自己在关于“正式创新”的严肃讨论中不禁感到有些紧张。在小说写作中。经常＆＃39;＆＃39;＆＃39;＆＃39;是书面上的粗心，愚蠢或模仿的许可证。更糟糕的是，试图残酷或疏远读者的许可证。这样的文字常常没有给我们世界的任何新闻，或者描述了一片沙漠风景，而这一切-到处都是一些沙丘和蜥蜴，但是没有人。一个没有任何可识别的人类居住的地方，只有少数科学专家才感兴趣的地方。 </p><p>  It should be noted that real experiment in fiction is original, hard-earned and cause for rejoicing. But someone else&#39;s way of looking at things - Barthelme&#39;s, for instance - should not be chased after by other writers. It won&#39;t work. There is only one Barthelme, and for another writer to try to appropriate Barthelme&#39;s peculiar sensibility or mise en scene under the rubric of innovation is for that writer to mess around with chaos and disaster and, worse, selfdeception. The real experimenters have to Make It New, as Pound urged, and in the process have to find things out for themselves. But if writers haven&#39;t taken leave of their senses, they also want to stay in touch with us, they want to carry news from their world to ours.</p><p>应该注意的是，小说中的真实实验是原创的，来之不易，并且很容易让人高兴。但是其他人不应追随别人看待事物的方式，例如巴特尔姆。它不会起作用。巴瑟尔姆只有一个，而另一位作家试图在创新的专栏下适应巴特尔默特有的感性或场景，是因为该作家会陷入混乱和灾难，更糟的是自欺欺人。庞德敦促，真正的实验者必须使它变得新颖，并且在此过程中必须自己寻找事物。但是，如果作家们没有放任自己的理智，他们也希望与我们保持联系，他们希望将新闻从他们的世界传播到我们的世界。</p><p>  It&#39;s possible, in a poem or a short story, to write about commonplace things and objects using commonplace but precise language, and to endow those things - a chair, a window curtain, a fork, a stone, a woman&#39;s earrings - with immense, even startling power. It is possible to write a line of seemingly innocuous dialogue and have it send a chill along the reader&#39;s spine - the source of artistic delight, as Nabokov would have it. That&#39;s the kind of writing that most interests me. I hate sloppy or haphazard writing whether it flies under the banner of experimentation or else is just clumsily rendered realism. In Isaac Babel&#39;s wonderful short story, &#39;&#39;Guy de Maupassant,&#39;&#39; the narrator has this to say about the writing of fiction: &#39;&#39;No iron can pierce the heart with such force as a period put just at the right place.&#39;&#39; This too ought to go on a three-by-five.</p><p>  可以用一首诗或一则短篇小说，用平凡而又精确的语言写一些平凡的事物和物体，并赋予它们—椅子，窗帘，叉子，石头，女人39; s耳环-巨大，甚至令人吃惊。可以写一系列看似无害的对话，并让读者感到不寒而栗，这就像纳博科夫所希望的那样，是艺术乐趣的源泉。那是我最感兴趣的一种写作。我讨厌草率的或随意的写作，无论它是在实验的旗帜下飞翔，还是只是笨拙地呈现为现实。在以撒·巴贝尔（Isaac Babel）的精彩短篇小说中，盖伊·莫帕桑（Guy de Maupassant）叙述者对小说的写作有这样的说法：＆＃39;＆＃39;铁不能用在正确的时期放置的力量刺穿心脏。这也应该进行三乘五进行。</p><p>  Evan Connell said once that he knew he was finished with a short story when he found himself going through it and taking out commas and then going through the story again and putting commas back in the same places. I like that way of working on something. I respect that kind of care for what is being done. That&#39;s all we have, finally, the words, and they had better be the right ones, with the punctuation in the right places so that they can best say what they are meant to say. If the words are heavy with the writer&#39;s own unbridled emotions, or if they are imprecise and inaccurate for some other reason - if the words are in any way blurred -the reader&#39;s eyes will slide right over them and nothing will be achieved. The reader&#39;s own artistic sense will simply not be engaged. Henry James called this sort of hapless writing &#39;&#39;weak specification.&#39;&#39;</p><p>  埃文·康奈尔（Evan Connell）曾经说过，当他发现自己经历了一段短篇小说并拿出逗号然后再次经历该故事并将逗号放回原处时，他知道自己已经完成了一个短篇小说。我喜欢这种工作方式。我尊重正在做的事情。最后，这就是我们所拥有的所有单词，并且最好是正确的单词，并在正确的位置标点，以便他们能够最好地说出要说的意思。如果这些字眼沉重地表达了作者自己的无拘无束的情绪，或者由于某些其他原因它们不准确且不准确-如果这些字眼模糊不清，读者的视线将直接滑过它们，并且什么都不会实现。读者自己的艺术意识将完全不会参与。亨利·詹姆斯（Henry James）称这种倒霉的文字“弱规范”。</p><p>  I have friends who&#39;ve told me they had to hurry a book because they needed the money, their editor or their wife was leaning on them or leaving them - something, some apology for the writing not being very good. &#39;&#39;It would have been better if I&#39;d taken the time.&#39;&#39; I was dumbfounded when I heard a novelist friend say this. I still am, if I think about it, which I don&#39;t. It&#39;s none of my business. But if the writing can&#39;t be made as good as it is within us to make it, then why do it? In the end it&#39;s all we have, the only thing we can take into the grave. I wanted to say to my friend, for heaven&#39;s sake go do something else. There have to be easier and maybe more honest ways to try and earn a living. Or else just do it to the best of your abilities, your talents, and then don&#39;t justify or make excuses. Don&#39;t complain, don&#39;t explain.</p><p>  我有一些朋友告诉我，他们必须赶紧读书，因为他们需要钱，他们的编辑或妻子正倚靠在他们身上或离开他们-有些东西，对于写作的歉意有些不好。如果花时间，那会更好。当我听到一个小说家的朋友这样说时，我很傻。如果我考虑的话，我仍然不会。不关我的事。但是，如果写作不能达到我们内心的要求，那为什么要这么做呢？最后，我们拥有的一切，是我们唯一可以带入坟墓的东西。我想对我的朋友说，为了天堂，去做些别的事情。必须有更简单，也许更诚实的方式来谋生。否则，请尽其所能，发挥才能，然后再没有理由或找借口。不要抱怨，不要解释。</p><p>  In an essay called, simply enough, &#39;&#39;Writing Short Stories,&#39;&#39; Flannery O&#39;Connor talks about writing as an act of discovery. O&#39;Connor says she most often did not know where she was going when she sat down to work on a short story. She says she doubts that many writers know where they are going when they begin something. She uses &#39;&#39;Good Country People&#39;&#39; as an example of how she put together a short story whose ending she could not even guess at until she was nearly there:</p><p>  在一篇名为“写短篇小说”的简单文章中， Flannery O＆＃39; Connor谈到写作是一种发现行为。康纳说，当她坐下来写短篇小说时，她通常不知道要去哪里。她说，她怀疑许多作家在开始创作时就知道他们要去哪里。她使用的是“好乡下人”。举一个例子，说明她如何编成短篇小说，直到她快到那里时，她的结局都无法猜测：</p><p>  &#39;&#39;When I started writing that story, I didn&#39;t know there was going to be a Ph.D. with a wooden leg in it. I merely found myself one morning writing a description of two women I knew something about, and before I realized it, I had equipped one of them with a daughter with a wooden leg. I brought in the Bible salesman, but I had no idea what I was going to do with him. I didn&#39;t know he was going to steal that wooden leg until ten or twelve lines before he did it, but when I found out that this was what was going to happen, I realized it was inevitable.&#39;&#39;</p><p>  ＆＃39;＆＃39;当我开始写那个故事时，我不知道会有博士学位。有一条木腿。我只是发现自己一个早晨写了一个我所了解的两个女人的描述，而在意识到之前，我给其中一个女人装备了一个带木腿的女儿。我带来了圣经推销员，但我不知道该如何对待他。我不知道他会在那条木腿被偷走之前先偷十条或十二条，但是当我发现这将要发生时，我意识到这是不可避免的。 ＃39;</p><p>  When I read this some years ago it came as a shock that she, or anyone for that matter, wrote stories in this fashion. I thought this was my uncomfortable secret, and I was just a little uneasy with it. For sure I thought this way of working on a short story somehow revealed my own shortcomings. I remember being tremendously heartened by reading what she had to say on the subject.</p><p>  几年前，当我读到这篇文章时，她或任何与此有关的人以这种方式写故事时感到震惊。我以为这是我不舒服的秘密，对此我有点不安。可以肯定的是，我认为这种处理短篇小说的方式以某种方式揭示了我自己的缺点。我记得读过她在这个问题上要说的内容后，我倍受鼓舞。 </p><p>  I once sat down to write what turned out to be a pretty good story, though only the first sentence of the story had offered itself to me when I began it. For several days I&#39;d been going around with this sentence in my head: &#39;&#39;He was running the vacuum cleaner when the telephone rang.&#39;&#39; I knew a story was there and that it wanted telling. I felt it in my bones, that a story belonged with that beginning, if I could just have the time to write it. I found the time, an entire day - twelve, fifteen hours even - if I wanted to make use of it. I did, and I sat down in the morning and wrote the first sentence, and other sentences promptly began to attach themselves. I made the story just as I&#39;d make a poem; one line and then the next, and the next. Pretty soon I could see a story, and I knew it was my story, the one I&#39;d been wanting to write.</p><p>我曾经坐下来写一个看起来很不错的故事，尽管当我开始讲故事时只有故事的第一句话给了我。几天来，我一直在脑海里回想着这句话：＆＃39;＆＃39;电话铃响时，他正在运行吸尘器。我知道那里有一个故事，而且想讲。如果能有时间写一个故事，那我就深深地感到这是一个故事的开始。我想花一整天的时间-甚至十二，十五个小时-即使我想利用它。我做到了，我早上坐下来写下了第一句话，其他的句子很快就开始与众不同。我讲故事就像写诗一样；一行，然后下一行，再下一行。很快我就能看到一个故事，而且我知道那是我的故事，我一直想写一个故事。</p><p>  I like it when there is some feeling of threat or sense of menace in short stories. I think a little menace is fine to have in a story. For one thing, it&#39;s good for the circulation. There has to be tension, a sense that something is imminent, that certain things are in relentless motion, or else, most often, there simply won&#39;t be a story. What creates tension in a piece of fiction is partly the way the concrete words are linked together to make up the visible action of the story. But it&#39;s also the things that are left out, that are implied, the landscape just under the smooth (but sometimes broken and unsettled) surface of things.</p><p>  当短篇小说有某种威胁感或威胁感时，我喜欢它。我认为故事中有一点威胁是可以的。一方面，它有利于流通。必须要有紧张感，某种即将来临的感觉，某些事物会不停地运动，否则，在大多数情况下，根本就不会有故事。在一部小说中产生张力的部分原因是将具体单词链接在一起以构成故事的可见动作。但这也就是被遗忘的事物，即隐含的事物，位于事物的光滑（但有时是破碎和不稳定）表面之下。</p><p>  V.S. Pritchett&#39;s definition of a short story is &#39;&#39;something glimpsed from the corner of the eye, in passing.&#39;&#39; Notice the &#39;&#39;glimpse&#39;&#39; part of this. First the glimpse. Then the glimpse given life, turned into something that illuminates the moment and may, if we&#39;re lucky -that word again - have even further-ranging consequences and meaning. The short story writer&#39;s task is to invest the glimpse with all that is in his power. He&#39;ll bring his intelligence and literary skill to bear (his talent), his sense of proportion and sense of the fitness of things; of how things out there really are and how he sees those things - like no one else sees them. And this is done through the use of clear and specific language, language used so as to bring to life the details that will light up the story for the reader. For the details to be concrete and convey meaning, the language must be accurate and precisely given. The words can be so precise they may even sound flat, but they can still carry; if used right, they can hit all the notes.</p><p>  V.S.普里切特（Pritchett）对短篇小说的定义是顺便一眼从眼角瞥见的东西。请注意＆＃39;＆＃39;＆＃39;部分。首先，一瞥。然后，给定生命的一瞥，变成了照亮当下的事物，如果我们很幸运（再说一遍）的话，可能会产生更深远的后果和意义。短篇小说家的任务是尽其所能，一窥一切。他将发挥他的才智和文学技巧（他的才华），他的分寸感和事物适应性；真实存在的事物以及他如何看待这些事物-没人能看到它们。这是通过使用清晰明确的语言来完成的，所使用的语言使细节栩栩如生，这些细节将为读者点亮故事。为了使细节具体化并传达含义，语言必须准确准确。这些单词可能非常精确，甚至听起来很平淡，但它们仍然可以携带。如果使用得当，他们可以击中所有音符。</p><p>  Raymond Carver is the author of two collections of short stories, &#39;&#39;Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?&#39;&#39; and the forthcoming &#39;&#39;What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.&#39;&#39; He is a professor of English in the writing program of Syracuse University.</p><p>  雷蒙德·卡佛（Raymond Carver）是两个短篇小说集的作者，请您安静下来，好吗？以及即将到来的＆＃39;＆＃39;当我们谈论爱情时，我们谈论的是什么。＆＃39;＆＃39;他是锡拉丘兹大学写作计划的英语教授。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/21/specials/carver-shoptalk.html">https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/21/specials/carver-shoptalk.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/讲故事/">#讲故事</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/写作/">#写作</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
