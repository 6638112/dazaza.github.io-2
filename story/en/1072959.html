This is that post. First I deal with Katja’s post, then Scott Alexander’s  Long Covid: Much More Than You Wanted to Know.</p><p>不久前，我提到我打算写一篇关于长新冠病毒的更长的帖子，以及Katja Grace关于它的帖子。这就是那个帖子。首先是Katja的帖子，然后是Scott Alexander的长篇新冠病毒：比你想知道的要多得多。</p><p>  Reports of Long Covid are often people who have symptoms, then blame them on Long Covid whether or not they even had Covid. The exception is loss of taste and smell.</p><p>长期新冠病毒的报告通常是那些有症状的人，然后将他们归咎于长期新冠病毒，无论他们是否有新冠病毒。唯一的例外是味觉和嗅觉的丧失。</p><p>  If you didn’t notice you had Covid, you’re at very very low risk for developing Long Covid.</p><p>如果你没有注意到自己感染了新冠病毒，那么你患长时间新冠病毒的风险非常低。</p><p>    My current estimate of the forward-looking-practical-use chance of a healthy non-elderly person getting serious, life-impacting Long Covid from a case of Omicron is about 0.2%, or 1 in 500. This number will decline further once Paxlovid is readily available.</p><p>我目前估计，一个健康的非老年人从奥米克龙病例中获得严重、影响寿命的长时间新冠病毒的前瞻性实际使用机会约为0.2%，即每500人中就有一人。一旦Paxlovid可用，这一数字将进一步下降。</p><p>  Diseases often have long-term negative health effects. Long Covid is not fundamentally so different from  Long Other Disease. If you are worried going forward about Long Covid you should consider things like permanently not living in a city to avoid diseases.</p><p>疾病往往会对健康产生长期的负面影响。长期新冠病毒与长期其他疾病并没有本质上的区别。如果你担心长时间的饥渴，你应该考虑一些永久性的不住在城市里的疾病来避免疾病。</p><p> A lot of people are in poor health. It is likely worthwhile to treat your health a lot more seriously than most people do, irrespective of Covid.</p><p>很多人身体不好。不管新冠病毒如何，与大多数人相比，更认真地对待自己的健康可能是值得的。</p><p>  Remember that the chance of preventing a Covid case via additional Covid prevention, going forward, even with extreme measures, is not all that high.</p><p>记住，即使采取极端措施，通过额外的新冠病毒预防来预防新冠病毒病例的可能性也不高。</p><p> If you compare the potential costs of Long Covid to the costs of Long Covid Prevention, it is obvious the second is a bigger threat.</p><p>如果你将长期新冠病毒的潜在成本与长期新冠病毒预防的成本进行比较，显然第二个是更大的威胁。</p><p>  Using Long Covid as a reason for not returning to normal once case levels come down would not be reasonable.</p><p>一旦病例水平下降，用长期新冠病毒作为不恢复正常的理由是不合理的。</p><p>  This may or may not be entirely fair, but I am going to use  Katja Grace’s post on LessWrong as a steelman of the case for worrying about Long Covid. It is by a thinker I respect, and is clearly advocating for the side of ‘be worried,’ and seems to aim to be exhaustive. It doesn’t cover  every concern I’ve heard, but it’s a lot of them.</p><p>这可能完全公平，也可能不完全公平，但我将利用Katja Grace在LessWrong上的帖子，作为担心长期新冠病毒的钢铁侠。这本书出自一位我尊敬的思想家之手，显然是在倡导“担忧”这一方，而且似乎旨在详尽无遗。它并没有涵盖我所听到的每一个担忧，但其中有很多。</p><p> I’m placing sufficient stock by her selection process that I will focus in detail on the ones she includes.</p><p>我通过她的挑选过程准备了足够的存货，我将详细关注她包括的那些。</p><p> Katja assigns letters A-R to her points, and I deal with these in order. Before I begin, I’ll summarize my takeaways so you can decide which sections you want to read or skip, and have perspective on what you are reading, if you want to go in non-blind.</p><p>Katja将字母A-R指定给她的点，我按顺序处理。在我开始之前，我将总结一下我的收获，这样你就可以决定你想读或跳过哪些部分，如果你想不看的话，对你正在读的内容有一个看法。</p><p> A, B, C and D establish that Long Covid exists but don’t make the case about frequency or causation that they might seem to be making. They do establish that a lot of people have a lot of chronic health conditions.</p><p>A、 B、C和D确定存在长时间的新冠病毒，但没有说明它们可能产生的频率或原因。他们确实证实了很多人有很多慢性疾病。</p><p> E is effectively punted to the section on Scott’s post since it talks about Scott’s estimate.</p><p>E被有效地推到了斯科特帖子的部分，因为它谈到了斯科特的估计。</p><p> F, G and H are a claim that there is a bunch of ‘dark matter’ style damage being done and that it manifests in lots of additional deaths that aren’t attributed to Covid. The population statistics don’t match up with this, and I consider these to be selection effects or otherwise non-causal.</p><p>F、 G和H声称存在一系列“暗物质”类型的损伤，并表现为许多非新冠病毒引起的额外死亡。人口统计与此不匹配，我认为这些是选择效应或其他非因果关系。</p><p> I reminds us that lesser outcomes can also be concerning but I don’t see how they can be that big a share of the overall problem.</p><p>我提醒我们，较小的结果也可能令人担忧，但我不认为它们会在整个问题中占那么大的份额。</p><p> J asks about future unknowns. Given how much time has now passed, and what I see as the relevant reference classes, I don’t think we need worry about this going foward, but precautionary principle does apply.</p><p>J询问未来的未知。考虑到现在已经过去了多少时间，以及我所看到的相关参考类，我认为我们不需要担心这一点，但预防原则确实适用。</p><p> K deals with the French study that says that Long Covid is correlated with  thinking you had Covid but not with Covid itself once you control for whether you think you had it, but when you only check Covid versus symptoms you still find the correlation. I agree with Katja’s claim that mostly this isn’t psychosomatic, but I do continue to think a lot of it is ‘blame whatever is wrong with me on Covid.’</p><p>K处理了法国的一项研究，该研究表明，长时间的新冠病毒与认为自己感染了新冠病毒相关，但一旦你控制了自己是否认为自己感染了新冠病毒，则与新冠病毒本身无关，但当你只检查新冠病毒与症状时，你仍然会发现相关性。我同意Katja的说法，即大多数情况下这不是心身疾病，但我仍然认为，这在很大程度上是“把我的问题归咎于新冠病毒”</p><p> L, M, N and O say already established true things but those facts don’t seem to provide evidence for Long Covid being concerning.</p><p>五十、 M、N和O说已经确定了事实，但这些事实似乎并不能为长期关注新冠病毒提供证据。</p><p>   R has logic I disagree with, and to extent it was a consideration I think it is no longer one.</p><p>R的逻辑我不同意，在某种程度上，我认为它不再是一个考虑因素。</p><p> The key question with all her points is what you’d expect to find in various different worlds that have different severities of Long Covid.</p><p>她所有观点的关键问题是，在不同的世界中，长新冠病毒的严重程度各不相同，你会期望发现什么。</p><p>  This is strong evidence in the sense that if we  couldn’t easily find really bad anecdotes, we could be confident that Long Covid  wasn’t a Thing worth worrying about.</p><p>从某种意义上说，这是强有力的证据，如果我们不能轻易地找到真正糟糕的轶事，我们可以相信，长期新冠病毒是不值得担心的事情。</p><p> It’s also strong evidence that people  believe that Long Covid is a thing.</p><p>这也有力地证明了人们相信长时间的新冠病毒是一种疾病。</p><p> Beyond that, it’s  not strong evidence, because a large percentage of people have had Covid, more people than we realize get long-term debilitating health problems from a range of causes, and anyone who experiences long-term debilitating health problems during the pandemic is likely to consider blaming them on Covid.</p><p>除此之外，这并不是强有力的证据，因为大部分人都有COVID，比我们意识到的更多的人从一系列原因中得到长期衰弱的健康问题，并且在大流行期间经历长期衰弱健康问题的任何人都有可能把他们归咎于贪婪。</p><p> Similar things happen for example with Lyme disease. The degree to which Long Lyme is a real thing is similarly disputed, but there’s little doubt that a lot of people will claim they’re suffering from Long Lyme who very clearly are not.</p><p>类似的情况也会发生，例如莱姆病。长莱姆病在多大程度上是真实存在的，同样也存在争议，但毫无疑问，许多人会声称自己患有长莱姆病，而他们显然不是。</p><p> Another key question is  where the anecdotes are drawn from. It is not surprising that Katja can receive a response to a bat signal put up on the internet – her social vicinity matters more, so I’m more interested in B than A.</p><p>另一个关键问题是这些轶事的来源。Katja可以收到互联网上蝙蝠信号的回应，这并不奇怪——她的社交关系更重要，所以我对B比a更感兴趣。</p><p>  Katja uses the plural in the title. She cites two anecdotes here,  that of Michael Osborne from her extended network, and the claim of a distant relative. As she notes, the distant relative was sufficiently distant that she didn’t hear about them having Covid first, and only mentioned it due to the Long Covid discussion, which is a far larger network and involves a much lower reporting threshold.</p><p>Katja在标题中使用复数形式。她在这里引用了两件轶事，一件是迈克尔·奥斯本从她庞大的人际网络中得到的，另一件是一位远亲的说法。正如她所指出的，这位远房亲戚的关系非常疏远，以至于她没有听说他们先感染了新冠病毒，只是因为长时间的新冠病毒讨论才提到这一点，这是一个更大的网络，涉及的报告门槛要低得多。</p><p> It seems that Michael ended up recovering, so it wasn’t lifelong, but this sounds a lot like losing a year and a half of one’s life. It’s really bad, bad enough that his account went viral on Twitter.</p><p>迈克尔似乎最终康复了，所以这不是终身的，但这听起来很像是失去了一年半的生命。真的很糟糕，他的账号在Twitter上疯传了。</p><p> For reference later, Michael got Long Covid in March 2020, so on average it was more likely severe, wasn’t treated as well as we can now, and he was certainly unvaccinated.</p><p>作为以后的参考，迈克尔在2020年3月感染了长时间的新冠病毒，所以平均来说病情更严重，没有得到我们现在所能接受的治疗，而且他肯定没有接种疫苗。</p><p> So the question becomes, how many people does Katja know as well or better than Michael, and also to what extent knowing Michael caused Katja to write the post and have her concerns.</p><p>所以问题变成了，有多少人Katja比Michael了解得更好，以及对Michael的了解在多大程度上导致Katja写了这篇文章，并引起了她的关注。</p><p> As an additional data point, in my fully extended networks, I have two examples of Long Covid. One is  also from someone who was of a broadly similar age, in excellent shape and did a ton of exercise. Not as bad as Michael, but a major hit to their long-term health that they strongly believe is due to Covid. The other is someone older, and I don’t know what happened there beyond a vague claim, it’s a very weak connection and we haven’t communicated in almost two years now.</p><p>作为一个额外的数据点，在我完全扩展的网络中，我有两个长新冠病毒的例子。其中一个也是来自一个年龄大致相似、身材极好、做了大量运动的人。虽然没有迈克尔那么糟糕，但他们坚信新冠病毒对他们的长期健康造成了重大影响。另一个是年纪较大的人，我不知道那里发生了什么，除了一个模糊的说法，这是一个非常薄弱的联系，我们已经有将近两年没有沟通了。</p><p>  If I was quickly ranking how striking hearing about a given person’s case of Long Covid would be to me, I’m guessing the younger of these cases was somewhere between 50th and 200th most potentially salient, and the older one between 200th and 1000th. I don’t know how many people fall into ‘I would have heard about it at all’ but I’m guessing the number is in the low thousands.</p><p>如果我很快对听到一个人的长时间新冠病毒病例对我来说会有多惊人进行排名，我猜这些病例中较年轻的在50到200之间，最具潜在显著性，而较年长的在200到1000之间。我不知道有多少人会说“我本来会听说的”，但我猜这个数字只有几千人。</p><p> There’s also a third potential case, but the person in question already had other chronic conditions, and claims to have had Covid three times but never got a confirmed Covid diagnosis. I am skeptical.</p><p>还有第三个潜在病例，但此人已经患有其他慢性疾病，并声称曾三次感染新冠病毒，但从未得到确诊。我对此表示怀疑。</p><p> Other than those cases, I don’t know of anyone claiming they have serious Long Covid that I know personally.</p><p>除了这些病例，我不知道有谁声称他们有我个人知道的严重的长期新冠病毒。</p><p> So overall, this seems like evidence that things that seem like Long Covid do happen, but it doesn’t seem especially strong or scary with respect to frequency.</p><p>所以总的来说，这似乎是长期新冠病毒确实发生的证据，但就频率而言，它似乎并不特别强烈或可怕。</p><p> C.  Rates of ambiguously-maybe-quite-bad symptoms seem very high, even for people who only had mild Covid</p><p>C.隐晦或相当严重的症状的发生率似乎非常高，即使对于只有轻度新冠病毒的人来说也是如此</p><p> This Norwegian study, n = 70k, has, for mild cases (in a sample mixing people who had Covid 1-6 months prior with people who had it 11-12 months prior):</p><p>挪威的这项研究，n=70k，针对轻度病例（将1-6个月前感染新冠病毒的人群与11-12个月前感染新冠病毒的人群混合在一起）：</p><p>   That’s among the unvaccinated – she estimates based on other studies that vaccination cuts this in half.</p><p>这是未接种疫苗的人群中的一员——她根据其他研究估计，接种疫苗可以将其减半。</p><p> As I said when I first saw this study, these results would show up at the population level. The United States has had 61 million  official Covid cases, and at least two thirds or so of cases are missed. The  majority of Americans have had Covid. A lot of those are from December 2021 and January 2022 so it’s too soon to know their long-term outcomes, but even excluding them we’re looking at half the population, so going from 4% to 7% fatigue, 1.5% to 4% shortness of breath and 4% to 7% brain fog, if it was all happening at once and symptoms are frequently long-term or permanent. I believe these are snapshot numbers. But given the correlation between different symptoms is imperfect, and how often the polls I’ll get to shortly showed that these symptoms interfere with the ability to work, this is a  very large set of claims, enough to materially decrease the size of the productive workforce.</p><p>正如我第一次看到这项研究时所说的，这些结果将在人群水平上得到体现。美国有6100万例官方新冠病毒病例，至少有三分之二左右的病例没有发现。大多数美国人都感染了新冠病毒。很多人都是从2021年12月到2022年1月，所以知道他们的长期结果还为时过早，但是即使不包括他们，我们也会看到一半的人口，所以从4%到7%的疲劳，1.5%到4%的呼吸急促，4%到7%的脑雾，如果所有这些都同时发生，症状往往是长期的或永久的。我相信这些是快照数字。但考虑到不同症状之间的相关性并不完美，而且我将很快进行的民调显示，这些症状干扰工作能力的频率有多高，这是一组非常大的说法，足以大幅减少生产性劳动力的规模。</p><p> Does the anecdata above match several percent increases in a large number of distinct symptoms? No, it doesn’t. People are primed by their Covid to look for problems that aren’t there, or are barely even there, or were caused by something else.</p><p>上述数据是否与大量不同症状的几个百分比的增加相匹配？不，它不是。人们被新冠病毒所激发，去寻找那些不存在的问题，或者根本不存在的问题，或者是由其他原因引起的问题。</p><p> As Katja notices, these numbers imply that a lot of people can’t work.</p><p>正如卡佳所注意到的，这些数字意味着很多人不能工作。</p><p> As an experiment, I did a poll while writing this asking if people (1) had Covid and (2) if they currently have at least one of the four symptoms above – fatigue, poor memory, brain fog or shortness of breath. Every study says there’s a correlation between such symptoms and  self-reported Covid but I’m curious as to magnitude in practice. I expect this to be true regardless of whether there’s a substantial causal link, both because the studies say there is one, and because I expect people to be more likely to notice such problems if they have Covid and to think they have had Covid on the basis of now having such problems.</p><p>作为一项实验，我在写这篇文章时做了一项民意调查，询问人们（1）是否患有新冠肺炎（2）目前是否至少有上述四种症状之一——疲劳、记忆力差、脑雾或呼吸短促。每项研究都说，这些症状与自我报告的新冠病毒之间存在相关性，但我对实际情况的严重程度感到好奇。无论是否存在实质性的因果关系，我都希望这是真的，因为研究表明存在一种因果关系，而且我希望人们在有新冠病毒的情况下更容易注意到这些问题，并在现在有这些问题的基础上认为他们有过新冠病毒。</p><p>   Early results had things reversed a bit, but this makes more sense. Here are the big observations.</p><p>早期的结果有点颠倒，但这更有意义。以下是重要的观察结果。</p><p> Wow, that’s a  lot of people reporting those symptoms. Like, a lot. 29%!</p><p>哇，有很多人报告了这些症状。比如，很多。29%!</p><p>     This is not a scientific study but it also  really is not compatible with rates doubling or more.</p><p>这不是一项科学研究，但它也确实与倍增或更高的利率不相容。</p><p>   So what we do know is, these kinds of problems  are a really freaking big deal in general. Almost 45% of those who report these symptoms say they’re wiping out half of their ability to work, and 29% of respondents reported the symptoms in the other poll, so this is at more than 10% of all productivity lost. And for a quarter of all people, at least one of these is being reported as a big deal.</p><p>所以我们所知道的是，这类问题总体上是一个非常可怕的大问题。报告这些症状的人中，近45%的人说他们正在丧失一半的工作能力，而在另一项民意调查中，29%的受访者报告了这些症状，因此这占所有生产力损失的10%以上。对于四分之一的人来说，其中至少有一个被报道为重大事件。</p><p> Once again, not a scientific study or representative sample or anything, but ouch. Seems worth exploring this more. Also, I realized I don’t know how to thread polls in Twitter’s interface, someone in the comments clue me in please for next time.</p><p>再一次，不是科学研究或代表性样本或任何东西，而是哎哟。似乎值得进一步探索。此外，我意识到我不知道如何在Twitter的界面上进行投票，评论中有人提示我下次请。</p><p>  If a lot of people can indeed no longer do their jobs, and we can be confident this is due to Covid, then this is a big deal.</p><p>如果很多人真的不能再做他们的工作，我们可以相信这是由于新冠病毒，那么这是一件大事。</p><p>  Katie Bach of Brookings argued a few days ago that an estimate of 1.1 million people out of work because of long Covid is reasonable, out of 103 million working age Americans she estimated had had Covid, i.e. a roughly 1% chance of being entirely out of work</p><p>布鲁金斯大学（Brookings）的凯蒂·巴赫（Katie Bach）几天前辩称，估计有110万人因长时间感染新冠病毒而失业是合理的，她估计在1.03亿工作年龄的美国人中有新冠病毒，也就是说，完全失业的几率约为1%</p><p> But that’s Katie’s estimate and not an actual argument or evidence.</p><p>但这是凯蒂的估计，不是真正的论点或证据。</p><p> Her second source is  a Washington Post article I’d seen before claiming lots of people were out of work due to this problem.</p><p>她的第二个消息来源是《华盛顿邮报》的一篇文章，我之前看过一篇文章，声称很多人因为这个问题失业。</p><p> Hard data is not available and  estimates vary widely, but based on published studies and their own experience treating patients, several medical specialists said 750,000 to 1.3 million patients likely remain so sick for extended periods that they can’t return to the workforce full time.</p><p>目前尚无确凿的数据，估计值也存在很大差异，但根据已发表的研究和他们自己治疗患者的经验，几位医学专家表示，75万至130万患者可能长期患病，无法全职重返工作岗位。</p><p> Long covid is testing not just the medical system, but also government  safety nets that are not well suited to identifying and supporting people with a newly emerging chronic disease that has no established diagnostic or treatment plan. Insurers are denying coverage for some tests, the public disability system is hesitant to approve many claims, and even people with long-term disability insurance say they are struggling to get benefits.</p><p>Long covid不仅在测试医疗系统，还在测试政府安全网，这些安全网不太适合识别和支持没有既定诊断或治疗计划的新出现慢性病患者。保险公司拒绝为一些测试提供保险，公共残疾系统对批准许多索赔犹豫不决，甚至有长期残疾保险的人也表示，他们很难获得福利。</p><p>  The Washington Post interviewed more than 30 people around the country experiencing the sudden financial slide caused by the long form of the disease.</p><p>《华盛顿邮报》采访了全国30多人，他们正经历着这种长期疾病导致的突然经济下滑。</p><p>  “I have hundreds of patients who have had to take time off for long periods of time, quit their jobs, or get fired from their jobs, or take lesser-paying jobs” because of long covid, said Janna Friedly, vice chair for clinical affairs at the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where she and her team are helping long haulers build strength and return to work.</p><p>华盛顿大学医学院康复医学系的临床事务副主任Janna Friedly说：“我有成百上千的病人不得不长时间休假，辞掉工作，或者被解雇，或者因为长期的贪恋而从事低收入的工作。”在那里，她和她的团队正在帮助长途运输工人增强体力，并重返工作岗位。</p><p>  John Buccellato, 64, an emergency medicine doctor at an urgent care clinic on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, was hospitalized with the virus in March 2020, in the same hospital where his mother died of covid.</p><p>64岁的约翰·布切拉托（John Buccellato）是曼哈顿上东区一家急救诊所的急诊医生，他于2020年3月因病毒住院，母亲死于新冠病毒。</p><p>  Chimere Smith, 39, a middle school teacher in Baltimore who has  testified in Congress about covid’s impact on her life, has not worked since she caught the virus in the early weeks of the pandemic.</p><p>39岁的Chimere Smith是巴尔的摩的一名中学教师，她曾在国会就新冠病毒对她生活的影响作证。自从她在疫情爆发的前几周感染了新冠病毒以来，她一直没有工作。</p><p>  The Social Security Administration said in an email that it has received 16,000 covid-related disability claims since December 2020, but the agency would not disclose how many of those were approved or denied.</p><p>社会保障局在一封电子邮件中表示，自2020年12月以来，该局已收到1.6万份与新冠病毒相关的残疾索赔，但该机构不愿透露其中有多少被批准或拒绝。</p><p>  She said she was laid off in March 2020. She  got covid eight months later and has been plagued by fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain and spikes in body temperature ever since.</p><p>她说她在2020年3月被解雇了。八个月后，她感染了新冠病毒，此后一直饱受疲劳、呼吸急促、关节疼痛和体温飙升的困扰。</p><p>  Hood got sick with covid in October 2020, forcing her this year to close the small business she had run with a friend for 15 years, selling wigs, specialized clothing and other needs for cancer patients. Hood’s attempt to return to the job she loved ended in frustration.</p><p>胡德在2020年10月患上新冠病毒，迫使她今年关闭了与一位朋友经营了15年的小企业，为癌症患者销售假发、专用服装和其他必需品。胡德试图重返她热爱的工作，但以失败告终。</p><p>  Two months after the September [2020] birth of her baby, Leon, she tested positive for the coronavirus.</p><p>2020年9月，她的孩子里昂出生两个月后，她的冠状病毒检测呈阳性。</p><p> I list all the article’s anecdotes both to illustrate that the article is largely a long list of such anecdotes, and also to note the  times of infection. Two were again  very early (March 2020 and ‘the early weeks’) and the others were all in 2020 as well. To which you could say, sure, it takes time to call Long Covid long and for financial distress to overwhelm you. But there really  weren’t that many cases in March 2020. What stands out about March 2020 is that cases were on average more severe and we had both poor understanding of how to treat Covid and a lack of hospital capacity. If lots of our examples of Long Covid  also come from that early, we should be skeptical that the risks are similar going forward.</p><p>我列出了这篇文章的所有轶事，既是为了说明这篇文章基本上是一长串这样的轶事，也是为了说明感染的时间。其中两次又是非常早的（2020年3月和“最初几周”），其他都是在2020年。你可以说，当然，把长期新冠病毒称为长期新冠病毒需要时间，让财务困境压倒你。但2020年3月的病例确实不多。2020年3月最突出的一点是，病例平均更严重，我们对如何治疗新冠肺炎的理解很差，而且医院能力不足。如果我们的许多长期新冠病毒的例子也来自早期，我们应该怀疑未来的风险是否相似。</p><p> Janna Friedly specializes in treating such patients, and they often get referred to her, so her seeing many such patients may not be indicative of a general public health pattern. Similarly, the ‘many medical specialists’ estimate here is the kind of thing that tends to be inflated for various reasons, and also that doesn’t come with any method, reasoning or data attached.</p><p>Janna Friedly专门治疗此类患者，他们经常会被转介给她，因此她看到许多此类患者可能并不代表一般的公共卫生模式。类似地，这里的“许多医学专家”估计是一种由于各种原因往往被夸大的东西，而且没有任何方法、推理或附加数据。</p><p> The only data we get here is the 16,000 disability claims related to Covid since December 2020. Is that a lot? About 500,000 disability claims are filed each quarter, and it’s been four quarters, so that’s about 0.8% of all disability claims. If we say that half the country has had Covid, then if Covid-related disability claims correspond with Covid-related disability, that means getting Covid raises your chances of claiming disability within a year by 1.6%. If some such cases don’t cite Covid, it could be more, and if some people are using Covid as a false justification (either intentionally or unintentionally), it’s less. I can think of other factors as well but the effect here is so small I’m not going to worry about them.</p><p>我们在这里得到的唯一数据是自2020年12月以来与新冠肺炎相关的1.6万份残疾索赔。很多吗？每个季度大约有50万人提出残疾索赔，已经四个季度了，这大约占所有残疾索赔的0.8%。如果我们说全国有一半人感染了新冠病毒，那么如果与新冠病毒相关的残疾索赔与新冠病毒相关的残疾索赔相符，这意味着感染新冠病毒会使你在一年内声称残疾的几率增加1.6%。如果一些这样的病例没有引用新冠病毒，可能会更多，如果一些人（有意或无意地）将新冠病毒用作错误的理由，可能会更少。我也能想到其他因素，但这里的影响很小，我不必担心它们。</p><p> It’s fair to care a  non-zero amount about something that causes a 1.6% rise in chances of disability within the year, but this does not rise to the level of ‘distort my life for months or years to avoid this.’ If Long Covid was causing several percent of people who get Covid to have a long-term inability to work, also known as disability, it would be a lot more than 1% of new disability claims.</p><p>对一年内导致残疾几率增加1.6%的事情给予非零关注是公平的，但这并没有达到“为了避免这种情况而扭曲我的生活数月或数年”的水平如果长时间感染新冠病毒的人中有百分之几长期无法工作，也被称为残疾，那么这将远远超过新的残疾索赔的1%。</p><p>  This meta-analysis of 81 studies I mentioned earlier also looked at work: “29.0% and 47.4% of those who were employed premorbidly were not able to return to work”; “5% to 90% were unable to reach their pre-COVID employment level” (p. 128) (As noted earlier, a lot of the studies in the meta-analysis seem to be small n, involving hospitalized people, without controls, and I don’t know what they did about this. Also, it’s possible I’m misunderstanding what group the meta-analysis is about, given how crazy high the numbers are).</p><p>我之前提到的81项研究的荟萃分析也着眼于工作：“29.0%和47.4%的病前就业者无法重返工作岗位”；“5%至90%的人无法达到新冠肺炎前的就业水平”（第128页）（如前所述，荟萃分析中的许多研究似乎都是小n，涉及住院患者，没有对照组，我不知道他们对此做了什么。而且，考虑到这些数字有多高，我可能误解了荟萃分析是关于哪个群体的。）。</p><p> Feels kind of grim to call these people ‘employed premorbidly.’ Academic writing is so bizarre, and also those are some of the broadest ranges I’ve ever seen and the control problem seems extreme, so it seems like this is a case of having to read the paper.</p><p>称这些人为“提前就业”感觉有点可怕学术写作非常奇怪，而且这些都是我见过的最广泛的范围，控制问题似乎非常严重，所以这似乎是一个必须阅读论文的案例。</p><p>  The literature search yielded 10,979 studies, and 81 studies were selected for inclusion. The fatigue meta-analysis comprised 68 studies, the cognitive impairment meta-analysis comprised 43 studies, and 48 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. Meta-analysis revealed that the proportion of individuals experiencing fatigue 12 or more weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27, 0.37;  p &lt; 0.001; n = 25,268; I2 = 99.1%). The proportion of individuals exhibiting cognitive impairment was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.17, 0.28;  p &lt; 0.001; n = 13,232; I2 = 98.0). Moreover, narrative synthesis revealed elevations in proinflammatory markers and considerable functional impairment in a subset of individuals.</p><p>文献检索结果为10979项研究，81项研究入选。疲劳荟萃分析包括68项研究，认知障碍荟萃分析包括43项研究，叙事综合包括48项研究。Meta分析显示2019冠状病毒疾病后12周或0.32周以上的疲劳的个体比例为0.32（CI为95%，0.27，0.37；P& lt；0.001；n=25268；I2=99.1%）。出现认知障碍的个体比例为0.22（95%可信区间为0.17,0.28；p&lt；0.001；n=13232；I2=98.0）。此外，叙事合成显示促炎标志物升高，在一部分个体中存在相当大的功能损害。</p><p> After three months, they’re claiming one third had fatigue and one in five were cognitively impaired. As I’ve noted in the past when discussing many similar studies (some of which likely got into this analysis) proper controls are key. This includes controlling for perception. That all goes double now given my quick survey found such high rates of impairment in the general population at an arbitrary time.</p><p>三个月后，他们声称三分之一的人疲劳，五分之一的人认知受损。正如我过去在讨论许多类似的研究时所指出的那样（其中一些可能被纳入本分析），适当的控制是关键。这包括控制感知。考虑到我的快速调查发现，在任意时间，普通人群的损伤率如此之高，这一切都翻了一番。</p><p> In the studies I’ve previously examined, there were a few that had very strong controls and found little or no Long Covid effect, and a lot that had little or no controls and found strong Long Covid effects.</p><p>在我之前检查过的研究中，有一些有很强的对照组，发现很少或没有长时间的新冠病毒效应，还有很多有很少或没有对照组，发现了很强的长时间新冠病毒效应。</p><p> Looking at their criteria for inclusion, I see the requirement that Covid diagnosis was confirmed, which is good and was not always present in studies I have seen, but I see zero mention of controls of any kind. The list of studies doesn’t mention their controls, nor do the exclusions. So looks like their control strategy was not to have one?</p><p>从他们的纳入标准来看，我看到了确认新冠病毒诊断的要求，这是好的，在我所看到的研究中并不总是存在，但我看到没有提到任何类型的对照。研究清单没有提到他们的对照，也没有提到排除。看来他们的控制策略是没有的？</p><p>  Taken together, the NOS rating of the component studies was moderate, evidenced by mean scores of 6.0 out of 9.0 for prospective/ambidirectional cohort studies, 4.1 out of 6.0 for retrospective cohort studies, and 5.6 out of 9.0 for cross-sectional studies.  Common methodological limitations were the failure to include a non-exposed group in cohort studies, failure to ascertain whether outcomes were present prior to COVID-19 infection, and a lack of sample size justification in cross-sectional studies. NOS scores within each category for all component studies organised by design are included (Table S1 in the  supplementary material).</p><p>总的来说，成分研究的NOS评分为中等，前瞻性/双向队列研究的平均分为9.0分中的6.0分，回顾性队列研究的平均分为6.1分，横断面研究的平均分为9.0分中的5.6分。2019冠状病毒疾病的研究中，没有一个非暴露组，未能确定COVID-19感染前是否存在结果，以及在横断面研究中缺乏样本大小的正当性。包括设计组织的所有成分研究的各类别NOS分数（补充材料中的表S1）。</p><p>  Herein we identified that approximately a third of individuals experienced persistent fatigue and over a fifth of individuals exhibited  cognitive impairment 12 or more weeks following confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Similar incidences of fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, were observed amongst hospitalized and non-hospitalized populations. Furthermore, in contradistinction to other persistent symptoms which may be self-limiting (e.g., anosmia) ( Hopkins et al., 2020), fatigue and cognitive impairment appear to endure and may potentially worsen over time in susceptible individuals ( Jason et al., 2021), as evidenced by similar proportions of affected individuals at &lt;6 and ≥6 months follow-up.</p><p>在2019冠状病毒疾病中，我们发现大约有第三的个体经历持续性疲劳，超过第五的个体在证实COVID-19诊断后12周或更多周出现认知障碍。在住院和非住院人群中分别观察到类似的疲劳和认知障碍发生率。此外，与其他可能具有自我限制性的持续性症状（如嗅觉缺失）不同（霍普金斯等人，2020年），易感个体的疲劳和认知障碍似乎持续存在，并可能随着时间的推移而恶化（Jason等人，2021年），at&lt；6和≥随访6个月。</p><p> A lower incidence of fatigue and cognitive impairment, respectively, were identified amongst children as compared to adults.</p><p>与成人相比，儿童疲劳和认知障碍的发生率分别较低。</p><p>   Those make perfect sense  if the symptoms are unrelated to Covid.
