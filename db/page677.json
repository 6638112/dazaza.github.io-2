You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society. Millions of people motivated simply by human compassion laid down the burdens of division. Around the country and the world you set aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity.\n That is why I had to visit Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, though I was admitted to the hospital the following day. I just had to see and feel it for myself that, after many years of silent witness, the truth is still marching on.\n Emmett Till was my George Floyd. He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor. He was 14 when he was killed, and I was only 15 years old at the time. I will never ever forget the moment when it became so clear that he could easily have been me. In those days, fear constrained us like an imaginary prison, and troubling thoughts of potential brutality committed for no understandable reason were the bars.\n  Though I was surrounded by two loving parents, plenty of brothers, sisters and cousins, their love could not protect me from the unholy oppression waiting just outside that family circle. Unchecked, unrestrained violence and government-sanctioned terror had the power to turn a simple stroll to the store for some Skittles or an innocent morning jog down a lonesome country road into a nightmare. If we are to survive as one unified nation, we must discover what so readily takes root in our hearts that could rob Mother Emanuel Church in South Carolina of her brightest and best, shoot unwitting concertgoers in Las Vegas and choke to death the hopes and dreams of a gifted violinist like Elijah McClain.\n Like so many young people today, I was searching for a way out, or some might say a way in, and then I heard the voice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on an old radio. He was talking about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice. He said it is not enough to say it will get better by and by. He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out. When you see something that is not right, you must say something. You must do something. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.\n Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble. Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it.\n You must also study and learn the lessons of history because humanity has been involved in this soul-wrenching, existential struggle for a very long time. People on every continent have stood in your shoes, through decades and centuries before you. The truth does not change, and that is why the answers worked out long ago can help you find solutions to the challenges of our time. Continue to build union between movements stretching across the globe because we must put away our willingness to profit from the exploitation of others.\n Though I may not be here with you, I urge you to answer the highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly believe. In my life I have done all I can to demonstrate that the way of peace, the way of love and nonviolence is the more excellent way. Now it is your turn to let freedom ring.\n When historians pick up their pens to write the story of the 21st century, let them say that it was your generation who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression and war. So I say to you, walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.\n  John Lewis, the civil rights leader and congressman who died on July 17, wrote this essay shortly before his death.\n  The Times is committed to publishing   a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"note_en": "Emergency crews are responding to reports a helicopter has crashed in the New South Wales Riverina after colliding with powerlines.\n The United Nations human rights office has issued a stark warning to authorities in the US against using disproportional force against protesters and journalists involved in anti-systemic racism protests across the country.\n The UN human rights office voiced concerns about officers obscuring their badge numbers in order to act with anonymity\n Police across the world have faced sharp criticism for using excessive force against the largely peaceful protests\n The UN called on authorities to specifically ensure federal and local police were clearly identifiable, after images emerged of officers hiding their badge numbers when using force against protesters.\n &#34;There have been reports that peaceful protesters have been detained by unidentified police officers,&#34; said Liz Throssell, UN human rights spokesperson.\n &#34;That is a worry because it may place those detained outside the protection of the law and may give rise to arbitrary detention and other human rights violations.&#34;\n  The Black Lives Matter movement, rekindled in May after the murder of unarmed black man George Floyd by Minneapolis police, saw protests against systemic racism held across the world. Police used riot dispersion techniques to disperse the largely peaceful protests, including in Australia.\n  The city of Portland, Oregon has become a flashpoint for flare-ups between protesters and authorities, so much so that a federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against federal law enforcement, barring them from using force against journalists and legal observers in Portland.\n The militarised federal authorities,  deployed by the Trump administration against the wishes of local officials, have used tear gas, less-lethal ammunition and other force against protesters who have been targeting the Portland courthouse with vandalism.\n  Under the law, the Federal Government has the authority to protect federal buildings and property, though some analysts see it as a mark of Mr Trump&#39;s campaign strategy of cracking down on law and order.\n On Wednesday night, Mayor Ted Wheeler was among those tear-gassed by police. He called it an abuse of federal power that was escalating the violence.\n   A lawsuit has also been filed on behalf of journalists whom federal agents had hit with non-lethal &#34;impact munitions.&#34;\n Police in Chicago have also been accused of excessive force after using their batons against demonstrators who threw frozen water bottles, fireworks and other projectiles at officers.\n The Chicago protests targeted the statue of Christopher Columbus, which was officially removed from its pedestal in Grant Park on Friday morning.\n Violence also erupted in Denver after Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with supporters of police.\n Police said they used pepper balls and pepper spray to disperse the larger Black Lives Matter contingent.", "posttime": "2020-07-31

"note_en": "An amendment proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that would ban the US military from recruiting on Twitch failed a House vote Thursday evening. Had it passed, it would have been  an amendment to the House Committee on Appropriations bill, which is part of the process in how the Pentagon\u2019s annual budget is set.\n The vote is now at 45 yeas to 105 nays. Majority is not in favor of  @AOC&#39;s bill. The US Navy and Army have stated they will continue to stream on Twitch and declined to comment on pending legislation.\n\u2014 Shannon Liao (@Shannon_Liao)  July 30, 2020\n  Imagine trying to explain to your colleagues who are members of Congress what Twitch is\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)  July 30, 2020\n Ocasio-Cortez gave an impassioned speech on the House floor in advance of the vote on Thursday. \u201cChildren should not be targeted in general for many marketing purposes in addition to military service,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cRight now, currently, children on platforms such as Twitch are bombarded with banner ads linked to recruitment signup forms that can be submitted by children as young as 12 years old. These are not education outreach programs for the military.\u201d\n  The US military isn\u2019t new to using streaming channels and video gaming to recruit people. Several branches of the military \u2014 with the exception of the Marines \u2014 have had esports  teams since 2018. And according to  Military.com, the Army\u2019s esports efforts alone generated 3,500 recruiting leads in fiscal year 2019.\n Last week, the Army  paused its use of Twitch for recruitment after its channel was criticized for banning viewers who asked about war crimes. The Army told   GameSpot: \u201cThe team has paused streaming to review internal policies and procedures, as well as all platform-specific policies, to ensure those participating in the space are clear before streaming resumes.\u201d\n And earlier this month,  Twitch told the Army to stop sharing phony prize giveaways on its channel that promised an Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, only for users to be directed to a recruitment page when they clicked through.\n The language of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s draft would have made that pause permanent, banning US military organizations from using funds to \u201cmaintain a presence on Twitch.com or any video game, e-sports, or live-streaming platform.\u201d\n Update July 30th, 7:19PM ET : Made changes to reflect that the amendment failed a

"note_en": "Twitter provided an update about the unprecedented July 15th attack that allowed hackers to tweet from some of the most high-profile accounts on the service, in  a blog post and  a series of tweets published Thursday evening. Twitter now says that a few employees were targeted in a phone spear phishing attack. While Twitter doesn\u2019t quite say, that presumably means hackers called up Twitter employees while posing as colleagues or members of Twitter\u2019s own security team, and got them to reveal the credentials they use to access internal systems.\n Twitter had previously said its  own tools were compromised in the attack, but up until this point, the company hadn\u2019t specified how that had happened. \u201cThis attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,\u201d Twitter said  in a tweet from its support account.\n By obtaining employee credentials, they were able to target specific employees who had access to our account support tools. They then targeted 130 Twitter accounts - Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7.\n\u2014 Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)  July 31, 2020\n Twitter also reiterated that the attackers targeted 130 accounts, tweeted from 45, and accessed the direct messages of 36, but lowered the number of accounts that had their Twitter data downloaded (which would have also included direct messages)  from \u201cup to 8\u201d to 7.\n Twitter limited features and  locked accounts for some users in the immediate aftermath of the attack. While many features have come back, \u201csome features (namely, accessing the  Your Twitter Data download feature) and processes have been impacted,\u201d Twitter said in its blog post. The company  also said it has \u201csignificantly limited\u201d access to its internal tools for the moment  and is \u201cimproving our methods for detecting and preventing inappropriate access to our internal systems.\u201d\n We\u2019re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools. We are also improving our methods for detecting and preventing inappropriate access to our internal systems and prioritizing security work across many of our teams.\n\u2014 Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)  July 31, 2020\n During the attack, hackers tweeted a bitcoin scam from the Twitter accounts of President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and more. The FBI  has launched an investigation into the attack.", "posttime": "2020-07-31 10:10:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,\u8bbf\u95ee,twitter",

chip in the C128.I\u2019m now mostly done with this process so I think it\u2019s time to share some of the findings.\n This has been a very interesting project as I did not really know much about semiconductor designand manufacturing. My existing knowledge extended to having seen some die shots and admiring the prettylooking pictures.\n It all started with me buying a cheap microscope to help with soldering surface mount components.\n  Some time later I ended up watching a video on youtube showing a simpler way of getting silicon dies outof the packaging.\n This looked simple enough to try at home as I already had all the equipment needed. Decapping an IC usually involves heated sulphuric acid orother similar nasty chemicals which I do not really want to play with at home. So I dug out a couple of broken MOS chips I had lying around(never throw things away, could come in handy). After fiddling around a bit I ended up with two 8521R0 dies and one 8721 PLA.The first real photo was the one show in the last post.\n   While this was a success I quickly realised that this microscope did not have enough resolution for me to be able to capture images of highenough quality. The maximum magnification is 90x, when using a 2x barlow lens. Additionally it does not have a stage so I had to place the dieon a table and then move the whole microscope, which is very unstable and makes it hard to capture the bits you want to see.\n   This proved to be much better at taking pictures of decent quality, I was however not happy with the camera I bought with it. It\u2019s a cheap camera with no capability for me to manage it remotely except using the AmScope application. Around this time, the Raspberry Pi foundationreleased the new High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi. This camera has a C-mount on it which matches the microscope so I quickly boughtone and put in on the microscope. This camera is fantastic for this job, full control of the whole process from the comfort of linux.\n  All in all a vast improvement to the previous setup. With the higher resolution I started needing to stitch the photos together to makelarger pictures. This sounded simple at the start and ended up being (as you can probably guess) not very easy at all. I\u2019m still strugglingwith the stitching, but slowly improving. One of the key things for a successful panorama stitch is to have consistent photos when it comesto panning, focus, white balance etc. etc. The more even the photos, the easier and better the stitching becomes.\n  This led me to start working on motorizing the table. It was getting really tiresome having to manually move the table around and the photosended up being moved in multiple axis etc.\n Lots of design work, 3D printing and research into CNC firmwares later I ended up with the following setup:\n  Going from the top we have a Raspberry 7\u201d display, with a Raspberry Pi4 mounted on the back. Not see is also the RPi HiQ camera mounted onthe microscope. The RPi takes photos, displays previews on the display and also runs the python code that controls the CNC board.\n The stage and the levelling table is motorized with 28BYJ-48 steppers controlled using a small board with an ESP32 running  Grbl_Esp32 and four AD4498 stepper motor controllers.\n This whole setup has some issues both in software and hardware but it works well enough for now to enable me to do some work.\n  With the logistics now sorted out I returned to the work of reverse engineering the chip itself. My initial focus was on the PLA chipas this should be one of the simpler ones to figure out. PLA stands for  Programmable Logic Array and is a very common structure in designs from this era.\n Looking at the schematic diagram from wikipedia we should expect to see two main arrays, AND and OR. Inputs are connected to AND andoutputs from the OR array.\n Going back to the previous die shot with can improve it with some annotations for the pins and the general areas of the chip. Once wehave established the pins we can see that all the inputs are connected to one array and all the outputs to the other array, just asexpected. This also helps us establish which array is which.\n  Here we see the I/O pins marked up with how they are connected to the lead frame and the pins on the DIP itself. We can also see the two mainareas that make up a PLA structure, the AND array and the OR array. Additionally there is some extra logic at the bottom marked with a questionmark. The function of this was unknown to me but as all the output pins are passing through it I was guessing that it was an output stage ofsome kind.\n  So, if we take a closer look at the AND matrix to start with we will see the following. The colours are a bit off as this was still doneusing the AmScope camera and I didn\u2019t figure out how to set the white balance on it.\n  This was not very helpful to understand what was going on as all the interesting bits are covered up by the top-most metal layer. This wasearly on when I was still learning a lot so to remove the metal I took a very brute force approach. I use heavy mechanical scrubbing toremove the metal which I also learned once I put it back in the microscope had removed everything but the substrate itself. Oops.\n   Looking closely at this image we can see little squiggly lines where a transistor is located to create a connection within the matrix.\n  Moving on to the OR array we see the exact same pattern. Hard to tell with the metal layer in place, though easier compared to the ANDmatrix. Much easier with just the substrate and diffusion left.\n   Armed with this knowledge we can now proceed with extracting the full PLA logic matrix from the images.\n I marked all transistors in each matrix with a dot and got the following picture:\n  All inputs are horizontal in the AND matrix, with each line having a normal and an inverted signal being fed in.All outputs are horizontal in the OR matrix and they are connected with vertical lines called product terms.\n By looking at the dots, we can decode the product terms by doing logic and for all vertical lines in the AND matrix, for example\n p0 = CHAREN &amp; HIRAM &amp; BA &amp; !MS3 &amp; GAME &amp; RW &amp; AEC &amp; A12 &amp; !A13 &amp; A14 &amp; A15\n For the outputs we instead look horizontal for each output and combine with or, for example\n    Going back to the full die picture, we now have everything but the box marked with a question mark in the output path.\n Looking at higher resolution photos of this we can see similar structures for each output. In all cases except two the structureis bypassed and the output from the OR matrix goes directly to the output pin. This is however not the case for the two pins  DWE and  CASENB.\n DWE is the Write Enable signal going to the main system DRAM chips, CASENB is gating the CAS signal towards the RAM. These two signals areprocessed in some form using these output gate structures, so I had to reverse engineer this block.\n  After quite some time reading up on silicon chip design and manufacturing and a lot of attempts I managed to come up with a schematicfor this that makes sense. I\u2019m not going to go into the whole process here but I will document and post it later. Here I would also liketo thank  Frank Wolf for his help, please support his project if you can!\n  Going a bit further, the way this is used in the  DWE and  CASENB outputs makes it a normal D-latch. The latch enable for this also comesfor the PLA matrix in a pair of lines in the OR matrix.\n  So as a final result we can now write down the full HDL code for the C128 PLA chip. I\u2019m using verilog for this. Mind you this is the firstverilog I\u2019ve ever written so it\u2019s probably suboptimal. Using a D-latch for the output in verilog is normally seen as a bad thing, howeverin this case I am doing it to replicate the logic and function of the existing chip.\n I have validated this to the best of my knowledge, but if I\u2019ve missed anything please let me know!\n In difference to the C64 PLA the C128 PLA can not be replaced with just an EPROM or similar due to the presence of the

"You may be forgiven for having thought that Wednesday\u2019s Big Tech CEO hearing\u2014in which the top executives at Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook were scheduled to get grilled by Congress on antitrust and unfair competition issues\u2014would be one of the must-see Hill events of the season.\n  But as with earlier congressional events in 2020\u2014notably the impeachment in the House and trial in the Senate of President Donald Trump\u2014Congress overpromised and underdelivered. What could have been a teachable moment for students of American public policy quickly morphed into something that was mostly (although not entirely) an empty exercise. Given how much the hearing overall was focused on the merely performative\u2014with so many members seeking primarily to score points for audiences on C-SPAN or at home\u2014it\u2019s worth asking what kind of lessons could be learned from Wednesday\u2019s hearings. I have a few ideas.\n        For me, the first lesson is clear: If you\u2019ve managed to corral the top four of this country\u2019s CEOs for an afternoon of questioning\u2014quite a  coup de  th\u00e9\u00e2tre in itself\u2014you must impose enough discipline on your committee members to keep their questions on the nominal subject of the hearing. Wednesday\u2019s hearing was convened by the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust. This should have meant that the members\u2019 questions\u2014and the tight intervals of time in which they got to ask them\u2014should have been focused on antitrust and competition questions. As a practical matter, this should have meant that Republicans\u2019 complaints about  anti-conservative bias were out of order\u2014and that Democrats\u2019 questions and comments about 2016 election interference by the Russians should have been out of order, too. It\u2019s not that these issues are categorically unrelated to competition questions, but they mostly are. The chair and the ranking member ought to insist that their colleagues stick to the topic.\n      A second lesson is that it does no one any good for a member to start out with his or her rage volume amped up to 11. Many Republican members lock-stepped their furious way through talking points based on dubious claims of anti-conservative bias, sometimes seasoned with conspiracy theories. Florida Rep. Greg Steube made it clear that he\u2019s certain the tech companies have deliberately made it harder for constituents and his family members to reach him through email.\n  That said, Steube was a bit calmer than Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who\u2014in addition to insisting that the tech companies are discriminating against conservative news sources and opinions\u2014fumed that the companies are actively plotting to ensure election victories for Democrats this fall. He also believes, or at least performs as if he believes, that Google tried to engineer a victory for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cIn 2016, Google tried to tailor their features to help Clinton in key states,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson on Wednesday, adding that \u201c[t]he good news is in 2016, in spite of what Google did, the American people saw it for what it was and Donald Trump was elected.\u201d The conspiracy theory claims were disturbing enough in their substance, but to anyone watching the hearing, the delivery was disturbing, too. Jordan seemed barely able to contain himself when other committee members expressed disagreement with his assertions, and at one point it seemed possible that the chairman might have to order Jordan removed from the room. Later, Jordan tried to steer the questioning to his concerns about \u201ccancel culture,\u201d which he insisted has made a victim of former New York Times opinion writer and editor Bari Weiss. \u201cI thought we had a First Amendment,\u201d he complained. (As a legal matter, the First Amendment has nothing to do with Weiss\u2019 decision to resign from the Times.)\n        I don\u2019t mean to suggest that only Republican members seemed driven by animus. Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline of Rhode Island basically declared that he already had concluded the companies were acting anti-competitively. Well, let\u2019s assume they have\u2014even if that\u2019s true, there\u2019s something to be said for saving your anger until after the first damaging admissions \u2026 or lies. By comparison, ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican from Wisconsin, seemed calm, perhaps comforted by the knowledge that he\u2019s retiring from the House after this year\u2014even if he did feel compelled once or twice to echo, pro forma, concerns about the purported anti-conservative bias. (My own representative, Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, thankfully took time to point out that, to judge by available statistics, conservative news and opinion sources are doing quite well at reaching their online audiences.)\n      A third lesson, which several members of the committee already have successfully internalized, is that there\u2019s no real substitute for being prepared at a highly granular level to challenge the witnesses about this or that company practice that you want to call into question. Let\u2019s be real here: Of course Amazon, a platform for other vendors that\u2019s also selling its own branded products, is using its data to decide what products to offer, how to price them, and how to compete. Of course Facebook, once it had a lot of cash in its coffers, ended up weighing whether to compete against uppity rivals or just buy them. If it\u2019s less clear whether Google or Apple have indulged to the same degree in similar strategic uses of platform data or the ability to purchase rivals, a prepared member of Congress ought to have done the homework necessary to dig down into what the differences are. Among the members who deserve good grades for meeting the homework requirement are Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, challenging Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg about the acquisition of Instagram and Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, who quizzed Google/Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai about \u201c geofence warrants\u201d that force tech companies to turn over data for anyone who happened to be near the scene of a particular crime.(OK, I\u2019m not entirely sure of the antitrust connection for geofence warrants, but I was still glad to see the question asked.)\n          Which brings us to the fourth lesson, which is this: Members of Congress, don\u2019t let the sheer dramatic impact of haling a couple of billionaires (Zuckerberg and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos), together with a couple of high-performance multimillionaires (Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and arguably Pichai, although the latter may already have crossed into the billionaire club) distract you from the primary purpose of these hearings, which is both to inform the public and to make the case (if there is one) for legislative intervention in these markets, with these particular businesses. The witness list was impressive, but it was hard to ignore the fact that committee members were so focused on Facebook, Google, and Amazon that we hardly heard much from Tim Cook, other than some not-entirely well-researched questions about Apple\u2019s App Store. At one point I found myself imagining Cook\u2019s sending a message in Zoom chat: \u201cGuys, I\u2019m still here? In case you want to ask me anything?\u201d Shortly afterward I wondered openly on Twitter whether \u201cTim Cook is filling out a crossword puzzle right now.\u201d To which I got this tweet in reply:\n    Today\u2019s NYT puzzle had \u201cIPHONE SEVEN PLUS\u201d as an answer, coincidentally!\n\u2014 Brett Thomas (@the_quark)  July 29, 2020\n  Don\u2019t get me wrong: I think there actually can be socially useful purposes\u2014even morally instructive ones\u2014in compelling Jeff Bezos to listen to a recording (provided by Rep. Lucy McBath, a Democrat from Georgia) of a hapless vendor whose textbook store was delisted by Amazon. If the hearing had had even that much dramatic focus throughout, the five-plus-hour event would have flown by. But the overall lack of discipline and focus on the part of so many of the committee members\u2014together with the CEOs\u2019 risk aversion that led them to avoid straight answers even when a \u201cyes or no\u201d answer might have been the safest response\u2014transmuted what should have been a historic confrontation with, and possibly a calling-to-account of, the biggest of Big Tech CEOS into a dreary slog. If Congress ever has another chance to assemble this all-star witness panel again\u2014which seems unlikely\u2014let\u2019s hope the members have at least learned a few lessons from this one about what not to do.\n  Future Tense is a partnership of  Slate,  New America, and  Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.", "posttime": "2020-07-31

Under that deal, Ford and VW have equal ownership stakes, which will be roughly 40% each over time. The remaining equity sits with Argo\u2019s co-founders as well as employees. Argo\u2019s board is comprised of two VW seats, two Ford seats and three Argo seats.\n Ford\u2019s announcement in February 2017 that it was investing in Argo AI surprised many. The startup was barely six months old when it was thrust into the spotlight. Its founders, Bryan Salesky and Peter Rander, were known in the tight knit and often overlapping autonomous vehicle industry; prior to forming Argo, Salesky was director of hardware development at the Google self-driving project (now Waymo) and Rander was the engineering lead at Uber Advanced Technologies Group. But even those insiders who knew Salesky and Rander wondered what to make of the deal.\n  Since then, Argo has focused on developing the virtual driver system \u2014 all of the sensors,\u00a0 software and compute platform \u2014 as well as high-definition maps designed for Ford\u2019s self-driving vehicles.\n That mission now extends to VW Group as well. Ford and VW will share the cost of developing Argo AI\u2019s self-driving vehicle technology under the terms of the deal. The Pittsburgh-based company also has offices in Detroit, Palo Alto and Cranbury, N.J. It has fleets of autonomous vehicles mapping and testing on public roads in Austin, Miami, Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C.\n The investment by VW expands its workforce and operations to Europe.\u00a0Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID), the self-driving subsidiary that was\u00a0 launched in 2017 to develop autonomous vehicle technology for the VW Group, is being absorbed into Argo AI. AID\u2019s Munich offices will become Argo\u2019s European headquarters. In all, Argo now employs more than 1,000 people.\n While the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles will be a long journey \u2014 a remark shared Thursday by Ford CEO Jim Hackett \u2014 the Argo investment has already provided the automaker with a short-term and timely gain.\n The automaker said Thursday it netted  $3.5 billion in the second quarter from selling\u00a0some of its Argo equity to Volkswagen. That gain gave the automaker a one-time boost in its second-quarter earnings.\n Ford posted a $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter, if the Argo transaction is counted. Ford lost $1.9 billion in the quarter before interest and taxes and one-time items. Ford reported a revenue of $19.4 billion, a 50% decrease from the same period in 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused the company to idle its factories for weeks.\n Still, the result could have been far worse. Ford had previously warned that it could post as much as a $5 billion net loss in the second quarter.\n Despite these COVID-19 headwinds, Hackett said Ford is still committed to the long-term pursuit of AVs, a point reiterated by CFO Tim Stone, who said the automaker continues to make investments to commercialize its autonomous vehicle business, including product development, engineering and testing.\n \u201cThe AV journey will be a long one, but Ford is now well positioned to run this race and compete like few others can,\u201d Hackett added.", "posttime": "2020-07-31 09:22:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9a7e\u9a76,startup,argo", "title": "\n\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8Argo AI\u4f30\u503c\u8fbe\u523075\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSelf-driving startup Argo AI hits $7.5 billion valuation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/self-driving-startup-argo-ai-hits-7-5-billion-valuation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9a7e\u9a76", "startup", "argo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "76597fa56f4265a2638f3da1a06c8dfd.jpg", "infoid": 1015347, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u636e\u798f\u7279\u79f0\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u8d85\u8fc715\u4e07\u540d\u5ba2\u6237\u65a5\u8d44100\u7f8e\u5143\u9884\u8ba2\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u7684\u8ba2\u5355\u3002\n\u54c8\u514b\u7279\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u8d8a\u91ce\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u6709\u9886\u5148OEM\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u53d7\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002\u201d\n\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9884\u8ba2\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8ba2\u5355\u3002\u62bc\u91d1\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u798f\u7279\u5728\u5236\u5b9a\u8be5\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u5236\u9020\u6218\u7565\u65f6\uff0c\u6b63\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e2d\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u5c06\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8ba2\u5355\u3002\n\u798f\u7279\u91ce\u9a6c2\u548c\u91ce\u9a6c4\u5c06\u5728\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5dde\u97e6\u6069\u7684\u5bc6\u6b47\u6839\u5dde\u7ec4\u88c5\u5382\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u91ce\u9a6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5c06\u5728\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u7684\u5de5\u5382\u7ec4\u88c5\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5bb6\u5de5\u5382\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u73ed\u6b21\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba2\u5355\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002\n\u798f\u7279\u9996\u5e2d\u8fd0\u8425\u5b98\u5409\u59c6\u00b7\u6cd5\u5229(Jim Farley)\u5468\u56db\u5728\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8981\u505a\u3002\u201d\u201c\u4f46\u7ec4\u5408\u5f88\u68d2\u3002\u201d\nBronco\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6000\u65e7\u3001\u5b9a\u5236\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u54c1\u724c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8be5\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u5a31\u4e50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u8f68\u8ff9\u5730\u56fe\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8ba9\u8f66\u4e3b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\u3002\n\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u91ce\u9a6c\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u6109\u5feb\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8d62\u5f97\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u901a\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u672c\u5468\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8c03\u4f83\u5176\u5168\u7535\u52a8GMC\u608d\u9a6c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u662f\u6d41\u884c\u8bed\u7684\u5ba3\u4f20\u6df7\u642d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u5df2\u7ecf\u660e\u786e\u5c06\u798f\u7279\u91ce\u9a6c(Ford Bronco)\u548c\u7279\u65af\u62c9(Tesla)CyberTruck\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\u7136\u540e\u662f\u7535\u52a8\u65b0\u8d35Rivian\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8ba1\u5212\u57282021\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u751f\u4ea7\u5176\u7535\u52a8\u76ae\u5361\u548cSUV\u3002", "note_en": "More than  150,000 customers have plunked down $100 to reserve a spot to order one of the vehicles, according to Ford.\n \u201cWe think this family of vehicles has big upside potential in the growing off-road category and this is a category with a leading OEM has not been seriously challenged until now,\u201d Hackett said.\n  These are, of course, mere reservations, not actual orders. The deposits are refundable. Now, Ford is focused on the due diligence required to determine how many of these reservations will be converted to orders as it lay outs its manufacturing strategy for the brand.\n The Ford Bronco 2 and Bronco 4 will be built at Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan. The Bronco Sport will be assembled at plant in Mexico.

(a) CurveBoards are 3D breadboards directly integrated into the surface of physical objects. (b) CurveBoards offer both the high circuit fluidity of breadboards, while maintaining the look and feel of prototypes.\t\t    \t\tCurveBoards are breadboards integrated into physical objects. In contrast to traditional breadboards, CurveBoards better preserve the object\u2019s look and feel while maintaining high circuit fluidity, which enables designers to exchange and reposition components during design iteration.\t\t   \t\tSince CurveBoards are fully functional, i.e., the screens are displaying content and the buttons take user input, designers can test interactive scenarios and log interaction data on the physical prototype while still being able to make changes to the component layout and circuit design as needed.\t\t   \t\tWe present an interactive editor that enables users to convert 3D models into CurveBoards and discuss our fabrication technique for making CurveBoard prototypes. We also provide a technical evaluation of CurveBoard\u2019s conductivity and durability and summarize informal user feedback.\t\t     \t\tIntroduction\t\t    \t\tBreadboards are widely used in early-stage circuit prototyping since they enable users to rapidly try out different components and to change the connections between them [23].\t\t   \t\tWhile breadboards offer great support for circuit construction, they are difficult to use when circuits have to be tested on a physical prototype. Since breadboards are box-like shapes, they distort the look and feel of the prototype when attached onto it and can interfere with user interaction during testing. In addition, they limit where electronic components can be placed on the prototype since the area for circuit construction is limited to the size of the breadboard.\t\t   \t\tOne workflow to better preserve the look and feel of the prototype is to solder components onto a protoboard or to fabricate a PCB. However, this requires designers to give up circuit fluidity since all components are fixed in place. Trying out different components and changing connections between them can no longer be done without additional soldering. Alternative methods, such as taping the components onto the prototype, offer more flexibility; however, they make it difficult for designers to exchange and rewire parts and do not offer the same circuit building support as breadboards.\t\t   \t\tIn this paper, we present a new electronic prototyping technique called CurveBoard that embeds the structure of abreadboard into the surface of a physical prototype (Figure 1). In contrast to traditional breadboards, CurveBoards better preserve the object\u2019s look and feel while maintaining high circuit fluidity, which enables designers to exchange and reposition components during design iteration.\t\t   \t\tSince CurveBoards are fully functional, i.e., the screens are displaying content and the buttons take user input, designers can user test interactive scenarios and log interaction data on the physical prototype while still being able to make changes to the component layout and circuit design as needed.\t\t   \t\tCurveBoards are not thought to replace existing techniques, such as breadboards or PCBs, but rather provide an additional prototyping technique for early stage interactive device experimentation. CurveBoards work particularly well during mid-fidelity prototyping when designers have already tested basic electronic functionality and in a next step want to work on the interaction design, i.e. integrate electronic parts within the context of a prototype form as part of interactive design practice [26].\t\t   \t\tIn summary, we contribute:\t\t a demonstration of its applicability across different application scenarios &amp; object geometries at the example of five interactive prototypes\n  an interactive editor for converting 3D models into CurveBoards including different options for the channel layout\n  a fabrication method for CurveBoards that uses 3D printing for the housing and conductive silicone for channels\n      an algorithm for automatic pinhole and channel generation given the specific curvature of a 3D model\n  a discussion of extensions of our approach, including the use of CurveBoard templates and flexible electronics\n\t\tIn the remainder of the paper, we will first review the related work on electronic prototyping tools and then discuss each of the contributions listed above in order.\t\t     \t\tCURVEBOARDS\t\t    \t\tThe main benefit of CurveBoards is that they allow designers to iterate on the interaction design of a prototype directly in the context of its physical shape. Using CurveBoards, designers can quickly exchange and reposition components on the prototype\u2019s surface. Once rewired, the prototype is fully functional, i.e. screens on a CurveBoard display content and buttons take user input.\t\t   \t\tBy enabling designers to prototype electronic circuits directly on a physical prototype, CurveBoards are particularly suitable for: (1) finding ergonomic and efficient component layouts, (2) ensuring that the components fit onto the physical prototype, (3) preserving a prototype\u2019s look and feel while iterating on a visual design, (4) preserving an object\u2019s intended function while testing a circuit, and (5) identifying component needs based on the prototype\u2019s form factor.\t\t   \t\tIn the next section, we illustrate each of these use cases at the example of prototyping an interactive device.\t\t      #1 Finding Efficient and Ergonomic Component Layouts \t\tFor interactive devices, the placement of I/O components plays an important role in achieving efficient and ergonomic interaction. The design of wearables is particularly challenging since I/O components have to be placed with respect to the user\u2019s body and the way the wearable device is worn.\t\t   \t\tFigure 2 shows this at the example of headphones with built-in speakers and music streaming capabilities, for which we explore the placement and type of menu controls to optimize for user\u2019s arm reach and ability to distinguish controls.\t\t   \t\tOur initial version of the prototype had the volume controls on the side of the user\u2019s dominant hand and the playlist controls on the non-dominant hand. After analyzing the logged interaction data recorded on the micro-controller over the course of a day, we realize that the playlist controls are being used more often than the volume controls. We therefore move the playlist controls to the side of the dominant hand.\t\t   \t\tIn addition, users informed us that it was difficult to distinguish between the volume and channel controls since they both used press input with similar button sizes. To avoid wrong user input, we replaced the volume buttons with a dial.\t\t         \t\tFigure 2. Finding efficient and ergonomic I/O layouts for a pair of headphones.\t\t       #2 Ensuring that Components Fit onto the Prototype \t\tWhen prototyping on a traditional breadboard, it is difficult for designers to estimate if all components will later fit onto the physical prototype. A physical design, especially when small or filigree, can limit which types of interactive components can be used and where they can be placed, which is an important part of interaction design.\t\t   \t\tFigure 3 shows this at the example of an interactive bracelet with display and button for menu control, a photoresistor and LED for heart rate monitoring, and an IMU for step counting. While prototyping directly on the bracelet, we notice that the large display that we initially selected does not fit on the slender bridges of bracelet, we thus exchange it for two smaller ones. After testing different button sizes on the bracelet prototype ranging from 2.3mm to 16mm, we find that the 7mm button fits best while providing the largest interactive space among other different options. We next add the LED and photoresistor and make sure they can be positioned together and offer enough space for users to place their finger. Finally, we exchange the wider IMU with a slimmer one, and replace the larger microcontrollers with two smaller ones.\t\t   \t\tWhile some components, like micro-controllers, can be made more compact in later design iterations via custom PCBs, user-facing I/O components (buttons, displays) will be similar in size since they relate to user\u2019s physical characteristics, such as finger sizes and what the human eye can see.\t\t         \t\tFigure 3. Upon the available space on the prototype, we iterate designs with the exchange of large OLED display with two smaller ones, and add selected push button &amp; DIP LED.\t\t       #3 Preserving \u201cLook\u201d and \u201cFeel\u201d \t\tWhen prototyping visual designs, such as a piece of interactive jewelry, it is difficult for designers to get a sense of the overall look and feel when using a breadboard that significantly distorts the prototype\u2019s shape. CurveBoards, in contrast, allow designers to integrate the components directly on the prototype\u2019s surface, which better preserves the shape..\t\t         \t\tFigure 4. The look and feel of this interactive ring is preserved since the pinholes are directly integrated into its geometry.\t\t    \t\tFigure 4 shows this at the example of an interactive ring for which we iterate on the placement of LEDs. Since in our CurveBoard the pinholes form a part of the object geometry, no additional space is needed for them. We try different LED arrangements and based on how the ring looks on our hand, we decide to use multiple LEDs in a row rather than side by side. Note that while CurveBoard better preserved the shape, the pinholes are still visible and impact overall aesthetics.\t\t      #4 Preserving an Object\u2019s Intended Function \t\tTraditional breadboards add volume to an interactive object, which can hinder its intended function. For instance, a frisbee may not fly anymore since its shape is no longer aerodynamic, a ring may no longer fit on a user\u2019s hand, and a teapot may not be able to hold the same amount of liquid inside.\t\t   \t\tFigure 5 shows this in more detail with the example of an interactive frisbee that displays a light pattern when thrown. Prototyping this frisbee with a breadboard attached to its surface would make the frisbee dysfunctional, i.e. it would not fly anymore. CurveBoard, in contrast, preserves the shape of the frisbee and thus its function. Our frisbee design initially contained a microcontroller and an IMU for sensing when the frisbee is in motion. We then iterated on different LED layouts until we settled on the one shown in Figure 5b.\t\t         \t\tFigure 5. CurveBoard keeps this frisbee functional, which allows us to test the appearance of different light patterns: (a) circular design, and (b) POV \u201cCHI\u201d design when thrown.\t\t       #5 Identifying Component Needs \t\tBrainstorming interactive functionality without considering the physical form can be challenging for a designer, who is left with an abstract circuit on a breadboard. The direct, hands-on interaction with a prototype, in contrast, supports exploration, which enhances creativity and can help designers to envision interactive workflows and to identify the components needed to realize them [28]. In addition, since certain object geometries can affect component placement (e.g., high curvature may prevent access to movable elements like knobs or sliders [12]), brainstorming in the context of shape also allows to take such challenges into account.\t\t   \t\tFigure 6 shows this via the Utah teapot example for which we want to visualize its inside liquid temperature. After trying different display and temperature components on the teapot, we realize that the temperature is also needed for the teapot handle as an indicator to show if it is safe to hold. Since the tea handle is too small for another OLED display, we instead add one RGB LED onto the handle that displays either red or blue color to indicate the hot/cold. Later on, we decide to add a camera module on the inside of the lid to detect the tea concentration so that we know exactly when the brewed tea reaches the best saturation based on our preferences.\t\t         \t\tFigure 6. Here we brainstorm interactive functionality for the Utah teapot: (a) camera and display to monitor tea shade, and (b) LED and display to indicate temperature.\t\t      \t\tINTERACTIVE EDITOR FOR CREATING CURVEBOARDS\t\t    \t\tTo support designers in creating CurveBoards from their digital prototype designs, we developed an interactive editor. After loading the 3D model of the prototype, our editor first generates the pinholes across the model\u2019s surface. Next, designers connect the pinholes into a desired channel layout using either the automatic or manual layout tools. Once the layout is completed, our editor automatically generates the channel geometry and provides the fabrication files.\t\t         \t\tFigure 7. (a) CurveBoards interactive editor UI, (b) Example of a generated pinhole pattern.\t\t       #1 Converting the 3D Model into a Set of Pinholes \t\tDesigners start by loading a 3D model into the CurveBoard editor. Next, designers click the \u2018generate pinholes\u2019 button, which creates the characteristic pinhole pattern across the surface of the board (Figure 7).\t\t      #2 Creating the Board Layout \t\tNext, designers create the board layout, i.e. define how to connect the pinholes into power and terminal lines. Similar to 2D breadboards that have a fixed row and column layout that cannot be modified dynamically, CurveBoards are also subject to this limitation once the board is fabricated. However, besides the standard breadboard layout that the CurveBoard editor can generate automatically, designers can also modify the layout manually depending on their prototyping needs, or for maximum flexibility leave all pinholes on the board disconnected, effectively creating a Curve-Protoboard.\t\t     Automatic Channel Layout:  This method automatically generates a default breadboard layout across the surface of the 3D model. It requires minimal effort from the designer but also pre-defines how components can be placed (Figure 8a). Users can explore different versions of the automatic layout with different channel orientations on the object geometry by pressing \u201cGenerate Board Layout\u201d button multiple times.\t\t         \t\tFigure 8. (a) Automatic layout, (b) manual layout.\t\t      Manual Channel Layout:  Alternatively, designers can customize the automatic layout or create a new manual layout from scratch using the interactive tools for terminal and power line creation. Designers only have to select a set of pinholes and then indicate the desired type of connection using the corresponding button. This provides designers with more freedom in how to route the channels but comes at the expense of additional manual effort (Figure 8b).\t\t     No Channel Connections (Curve-ProtoBoard):  Finally, designers also have the choice to leave all pinholes disconnected, effectively creating a Curve-Protoboard. The holes for a Curve-Protoboard are bigger in diameter (1mm vs. ~0.3mm for Curveboards) and fit both a component\u2019s header pin and a wire. While this provides maximum flexibility, it requires additional wiring while prototyping.\t\t      #3 Export &amp; Fabrication \t\tOnce designers hit the \u2018export\u2019 button, the CurveBoard editor generates the final CurveBoard geometry containing all the pinholes and connection channels underneath the CurveBoard\u2019s surface (Figure 9). The CurveBoard editor then exports the geometry as an .stl file for 3D printing.\t\t         \t\tFigure 9. Generated 3D printable file: (a) in render mode, and (b) in transparent \u2018ghost\u2019 mode.\t\t      \t\tFABRICATION METHOD OF CURVEBOARDS\t\t    \t\tIn the next section, we describe the fabrication technique used for CurveBoards and provide details on the material preparation and mixing procedure.\t\t      Dual Material 3D Printing with Conductive Rubber \t\tOur initial goal was to use dual-material 3D printing to fabricate CurveBoards, with one rigid non-conductive material used for the housing and a deformable conductive material (e.g., conductive rubber) used for the channels to facilitate repeated plugging of components.\t\t   \t\tSince dual-material 3D printing with conductive rubber is still an experimental fabrication technique, we used the external printing services from ACEO, which is the only company we found to offer this type of fabrication (materials: ACEO Silicone GP White for the housing, and ACEO Silicone EC for the conductive rubber, Shore Hardness 30 A).\t\t   \t\tWe developed a range of 3D printed object geometries to test with their printing service, including different channel widths ranging from 0.6-1.5mm. However, we found that even the best of our prototypes still had a resistance of 1.4k ohm per channel (6-hole length). Thus, while the resistance was good enough to light up an LED (see Figure 10 for the 3D printed result), it was not conductive enough to work with other standard electronic I/O components. In addition, the maximum volume currently supported by the 3D printer is 200 cm3, with resolution ~1 mm to achieve reliable prints. Therefore, we conclude that dual-material 3D printing it is not yet suitable for fabricating CurveBoards.\t\t         \t\tFigure 10. (a) Dual-material silicone 3D printed CurveBoard, and (b) with SMD LED connected.\t\t       3D Print Housing + Fill with Conductive Silicone \t\tTo address this issue, we developed a fabrication technique based on 3D printing the housing and filling the channels with conductive silicone (Figure 11). It enables high conductivity at the expense of additional manual effort (filling the channels for a CurveBoard takes between 15-30min based on our experience building the prototypes for this paper).\t\t         \t\tFigure 11. (a) 3D printing the CurveBoard housing. (b) Filling the hollow channels with conductive silicone.\t\t    \t\tWe next provide more details on both the 3D printing process and the task of filling the channels with conductive silicone.\t\t     3D Printing: For 3D printing, we used FDM 3D printers and printed on both the Ultimaker 3 and Prusa i3 MK2. We tried layer heights from 0.1mm-0.2mm and found that all created CurveBoard housings with channels that were suitable for filling them with conductive silicone. The prototypes in this paper were printed with a layer height of 0.15mm.\t\t     Conductive Silicone for Channels:  To find a material mix that is both conductive and easy to extrude, we tested a range of different carbon fiber lengths, carbon-silicone ratios, and needle sizes.\t\t   Carbon fiber length:  The longer the carbon fibers are the more conductive the mixture is but the harder to extrude. We tried fibers ranging from 0.5mm to 2.5mm.\n  Carbon-Silicone ratios:  A higher carbon amount increases conductivity but makes the mixture harder to extrude. We tried ratios ranging from 3% to 10% carbon.\n  Needle size:  The larger the needle size, the easier it is to extrude the mixture but the more difficult it is to insert the needle into a pinhole. We tried needle sizes ranging from 20G (0.6mm) to 14G (1.55mm).\n    \t\tBelow, we describe the mixing procedure that we empirically determined to work best for filling CurveBoards.\t\t   \t\tTo create the conductive silicone, we first mixed 10g of chopped carbon fiber (0.7mm long, 7 \u03bcm diameter from Procotex [4]) with 3ml of isopropyl alcohol. After stirring and dispersing the fiber hairs, we mix them into 100g part A of a regular two-component silicone (type:  Smooth-On SORTA-Clear 37 Clear [34]) and stir for 5 minutes (Figure 12a/b). The carbon-silicone ratio is 5wt%, with same amount of part B added. Without part B, the conductive silicone will not start curing, i.e. we can keep the mix of part A + carbon fiber on the shelve to use over several days if stored covered.\t\t   \t\tOnce we are ready to use the silicone, we add 100g of part B ( Smooth-On SORTA-Clear 37 Clear) to the mix (Figure 12c), which initiates curing. After stirring for 5 minutes, we transfer the conductive silicone to a syringe (3ml, with 16-gauge blunt tip tapered dispensing needle) (Figure 12d).\t\t   \t\tThe sy\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-31 09:20:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7269\u7406,integrating,\u539f\u578b", "title": "CurveBoards\uff1a\u5c06\u9762\u5305\u677f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d", "title_en": "CurveBoards: Integrating Breadboards into Physical Objects", "transed": 1, "url": "https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/research/curveboard/curveboard.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7269\u7406", "\u539f\u578b"]}]
