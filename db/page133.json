Weeks into buying that meat pie shop, Singh watched tens of thousands of dollars burn due to failing equipment and contractor issues.\n \u201cI realized [that] I have so much support at the front of the house to drive revenue to the door, but I have no technology to support the back of the house,\u201d he said. Singh soon realized that his pain point was shared by many other restaurant owners, which seeded the idea for ResQ, a startup all about optimizing the back of the house, or non-customer facing, operation for restaurants.\n  ResQ announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in seed funding led by Homebrew, Golden Ventures, and Inovia Capital. Participating angel investors include Nilam Ganenthiran, president at Instacart; Gokul Rajaram, Doordash executive and board member of Pinterest and Coinbase, as well as customers, including Soul Foods, a global franchisee of Yum! Brands. ResQ has now raised $9 million in known venture capital to date.\n The capital will primarily help ResQ double or triple its 60-person team across engineering, sales, and operation roles. The company will also earmark money toward launching in new markets, building atop its current presence in San Francisco, LA, Dallas, Chicago, and Phoenix.\n  ResQ\u2019s business is split into two parts: a software platform and contractor marketplace.\n The platform allows restaurants to request, manage, and pay for a service that they need done, from plumbing issues to electrical mishaps. ResQ claims it can save restaurants between 10-30% in annual repairs by offering competitive rates, and faster communication and hiring loops. It charges a monthly SaaS fee per rooftop to a restaurant group.\n  The software layer sits on top of ResQ\u2019s contractor marketplace, which is essentially a supply of geographic-specific workers with a variety of specialties that can come to do repairs or management. In exchange for providing contractors with work, ResQ takes a portion of revenue they make from each service. Singh sees the marketplace business of ResQ as a differentiator from incumbents or startup competitors such as ServiceChannel.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t just need a fancy-looking piece of software,\u201d Singh said. \u201cYou need a product that can manage vendors, that can make sure they show up on time, that can make sure that they\u2019re not overcharging, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re a SaaS enabled marketplace in the background.\u201d By owning the supply side of the repair market, ResQ can have more precision when meeting demand and understanding its end customer.\n Of course, a challenge with any marketplace is balancing and sourcing a high-quality supply. ResQ has over 700 contractors on its platform right now, but it needs to continue building them up in order to meet needs and get restaurant services on time. Singh said that a majority of its contractor supply comes from its restaurant customers bringing on preferred partners to their platform. ResQ then backfills, he said, any gaps in supply or if there are any specialties that are missing. While that process may be convenient for now, the startup could eventually scale \u2013 and sweeten the deal \u2013 by generating its own supply of contractors.\n Hunter Walk, partner at  Homebrew, thinks that ResQ could eventually use its positioning as a marketplace to bring on edtech and fintech services to contractors. For example, it has plans to eventually turn into a skills provider to train and place local talent. ResQ also wants to turn into a \u201cbusiness in a box\u201d for these contractors, helping them grow their business through payment and billing support.\n \u201cFor me that\u2019s the difference between \u2018you\u2019re just making things more efficient\u2019 versus \u2018you\u2019re also giving some percentage of your worker base the chance to think in new ways about the services they provide,\u201d Walk said. \u201cIf you\u2019re just thinking about it as an as a optimization algorithm, then you\u2019re never really going to get into the \u2018what can I do to help make these people\u2019s lives better\u2019 and those are where some of the upside of the economics live as well.\u201d He noted that Singh\u2019s experience, and ethos as a founder, will lead to ResQ solving problems more holistically and humanly.\n   Even with successful operations, margins can be razor-thin in the restaurant industry. This reality puts any startup in the restaurant tech industry at risk: when costs need to be cut, SaaS tools could be the first to go. Toast, for example, initially  cut 50% of its staff due to the economic impact of the pandemic.\n  \u201cWe started building a new paradigm to our product and transitioned from a transactional marketplace mobile only focused on smaller restaurants, to a fully SaaS product focused on multi-unit operators powered by a local marketplace,\u201d Singh said. Surely enough, the company\u2019s revenue grew 750% over the past year.\n To date, ResQ has worked with over 3,000 restaurant groups including KFC, Taco Bell, and Tim Hortons. With millions in the bank, let\u2019s hope that number grows and it continues to find ways to grow its back of the house footprint.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:05:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u623f\u5b50,house,resq", "title": "Resq\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86750\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u56de\u5f52\u623f\u5b50\uff0c\u5934\u8111 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tResQ raises $7.5 million to make back of the house, top of mind\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/resq-seed-75/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u623f\u5b50", "house", "resq"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f4020b934dbbb20ce4d54d69ff343f6e.png", "infoid": 1067438, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u632a\u5a01\u5965\u65af\u9646\u632a\u5a01\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u4f7f\u7528\u53ca\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u662f\u4eba\u4eec\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6267\u884c\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u81ea\u6211\u602a\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u987e\u95ee\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u81ea2014\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u53ca\u65f6\u638c\u63e1\u4e86500,000\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5305\u62ec160\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u76845,000\u591a\u4e2a\u652f\u4ed8\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n \u73b0\u5728\uff0cMemory.ai\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u51fa\u5b83\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0cDewo\uff08\u53d1\u97f3\u4e3a\u201cde-voh\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5728\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5206\u6563\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5173\u6ce8;\u548c\u80f6\u6c34\uff0c\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u521b\u9020\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u5e74\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\n  \u8be5\u8d44\u91d1\u662f\u7531\u5f53\u5730\u6295\u8d44\u8005Melesio\u548cSanden\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\uff0c\u540c\u5fc3\u548cSn\u00d6Sthens\u4ee5\u524d\u652f\u6301\u7684\u3002\n \u201c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u201d\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5173\u8054\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u5730\u6db5\u76d6\u4efb\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u4eceAsana\u548cJira\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5f1b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5;\u6216\u8005\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\uff08\u4f8b\u5982Microsoft\u5df2\u7ecf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86Microsoft 365\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9 -

Timely has racked up 500,000 users since 2014, including more than 5,000 paying businesses in 160 countries.\n Now, Memory.ai has raised $14 million as it gears up to launch its next apps,  Dewo (pronounced \u201cDe-Voh\u201d), an app that is meant to help people do more \u201cdeep work\u201d by learning about what they are working on and filtering out distractions to focus better; and  Glue, described as a knowledge hub to help in the creative process. Both are due to be released later in the year.\n  The funding is being led by local investors Melesio and Sanden, with participation from Investinor, Concentric and SN\u00d6 Ventures, who  backed Memory.ai previously.\n \u201cProductivity apps\u201d has always been something of a nebulous category in the world of connected work. They can variously cover any kind of collaboration management software ranging from Asana and Jira through to Slack and Notion; or software that makes doing an existing work task more efficiently than you did it before (eg Microsoft has described all of what goes into Microsoft 365 \u2014 Excel, Word, Powerpoint, etc. \u2014 as \u201cproductivity apps\u201d); or, yes, apps like those from Memory.ai that aim to improve your concentration or time management.\n These days, however, it feels like the worlds of AI and advances in mobile computing are increasingly coming together to evolve that concept once again.\n If the first wave of smartphone communications and the apps that are run on smartphone devices \u2014 social, gaming, productivity, media, information, etc. \u2014 have led to us getting pinged by a huge amount of data from lots of different places, all of the time, then could it be that the second wave is quite possibly going to usher in a newer wave of tools to handle all that better, built on the premise that not everything is of equal importance? No-mo FOMO? We\u2019ll see.\n In any case, some bigger platform players also helping to push the agenda of what productivity means in this day and age.\n For example, in Apple\u2019s recent preview of iOS 15 (due to come out later this year) the company gave a supercharge to its existing \u201cdo not disturb\u201d feature on its phones, where it  showed off a new Focus mode, letting users customize how and when they want to receive notifications from which apps, and even which apps they want to have displayed, all organized by different times of day (eg work time), place, calendar items, and so on.\n \u201c Today,  iPhone  plays  so  many  roles  in  our  lives.  It\u2019s  where  we  get  information,  how  people  reach  us,  and  where  we  get  things  done.  This  is  great,  but  it  means  our  attention  is  being  pulled  in  so  many  different  directions  and  finding  that  balance  between  work  and  life  can  be  tricky,\u201d said Apple\u2019s Craig Federighi in the WWDC keynote earlier this month. \u201c We  want  to  free  up  space  to  focus  and  help  you  be  in  the  moment.\u201d How well that gets used, and how much other platforms like Google follow suit, will be interesting to see play out. It feels, in any case, like it could be the start of something.\n And, serendipitously \u2014 or maybe because this is some kind of zeitgeist \u2014 this is also playing \u00a0into what Memory.ai has built and is building.\n Mathias Mikkelsen, the Oslo-based founder of Memory.ai, first came up for his idea for Timely (which had also been the original name of the whole startup) when he was working as a designer in the ad industry, one of those jobs that needed to track what he was working on, and for how long, in order to get paid.\n He said he knew the whole system as it existed was inefficient: \u201cI just thought it was insane how cumbersome and old it was. But at the same time how important it was for the task,\u201d he said.\n The guy had an entrepreneurial itch that he was keen to scratch, and this idea would become the salve to help him. Mikkelsen was so taken with building a startup around time management, that he sold his apartment in Oslo and moved himself to San Francisco to be where he believed was the epicenter of startup innovation. He tells me he lived off the proceeds of his flat for two years \u201cin a closet\u201d in a hacker house, bootstrapping Timely, until eventually getting into an accelerator (500 Startups) and subsequently starting to raise money. He eventually moved back to Oslo after two years to continue growing the business, as well as to live somewhere a little more spacious.\n The startup\u2019s big technical breakthrough with Timely was to figure out an efficient way of tracking time for different tasks, not just time worked on anything, without people having to go through a lot of data entry.\n The solution: to integrate with a person\u2019s computer, plus a basic to-do schedule for a day or week, and then match up which files are open when to determine how long one works for one client or another. Phone or messaging conversations, for the moment, are not included, and neither are the contents of documents \u2014 just the titles of them. Nor is data coming from wearable devices, although you could see how that, too, might prove useful.\n The basic premise is to be personalised, so managers and others cannot use Timely to track exactly what people are doing, although they can track and bill for those billable hours. All this is important, as it also will feed into how DeWo and Glue will work.\n The startup\u2019s big conceptual breakthrough came around the same time: Getting time tracking or any productivity right \u201chas never been a UI problem,\u201d Mikkelsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a human nature problem.\u201d This is where the AI comes in, to nudge people towards something they identify as important, and nudge them away from work that might not contribute to that. Tackling bigger issues beyond time are essential to improving productivity overall, which is why Memory.ai now wants to extend to apps for carving out time for deep thinking and creative thinking.\n While it might seem to be a threat that a company like Apple has identified the same time management predicament that Memory.ai has, and is looking to solve that itself, Mikkelsen is not fazed. He said he thinks of Focus as not unlike Apple\u2019s work on Health: there will be ways of feeding information into Apple\u2019s tool to make it work better for the user, and so that will be Memory.ai\u2019s opportunity to hopefully grow, not cannibalize, its own audience with Timely and its two new apps.

The investment also included capital from LinkedIn, which previously invested, and corporate venture dollars from both HubSpot and Salesforce.\n The round caught our eye not due to its scale \u2014  nine-figure rounds are a daily occurrence in today\u2019s super-heated venture capital market \u2014 but due to the interesting position that G2 and its rivals occupy in the technology space. They provide a guide of sorts to various software niches, not only exposing a number of competing services in a single space, but also some signal about what service might be a good pick.\n  For the  immensely deep and  immensely wide software market, offering potential buying entities \u2014 all companies, in other words \u2014 directions when it comes to software buying decisions is a position of power. And one that comes with a unique set of challenges.\n G2 cannot simply provide lists of competing software products and user reviews. It needs to command a position of trust; if its users are worried that commercial interests are clouding its ratings and lists, the company\u2019s core product could be compromised.\n  In response to our question regarding balancing G2\u2019s commercial interests and review purity, Abel said that \u201cwhether a software vendor pays G2 or not has no impact on their rating on G2 and their placement in our category rankings which are 100% algorithmic and data-driven.\u201d That\u2019s a good start.\n Abel went on to say that G2 verifies all reviews, checks the \u201cbusiness identity\u201d of reviewers via their online profiles, and uses \u201cNLP and AI to score and validate all reviews including preventing any reviews by competitors or employees of a vendor.\u201d And, the CEO added, G2 has humans in the loop for verification as well.\n The process seems reasonable, but the company and its rivals like  Capterra will need to manage market trust as they continue to scale.\n On that front, the CEO expanded a bit on the growth metrics that it disclosed as part of its release. In that document the company said that it added \u201c700 paying customers for its Marketing Solutions in the past 12 months.\u201d TechCrunch wanted to know what percent growth that number represented, and what portion of G2\u2019s revenues come from that particular business line.\n Per Abel, the customer number represented a 45% growth rate, and that that \u201cpiece of [its] business represents the bulk of [its] current revenue.\u201d\n Parsing that a little, seeing 45% customer growth in a majority revenue line implies healthy growth. We lack several data points that we\u2019d need to convert that customer growth figure into revenue expansion itself, sadly.\n With lots of new cash in the bank, G2 has plenty of space to keep growing. Its CEO highlighted international investment as a place where he intends to invest, citing \u201cexceptionally strong growth across Europe and Asia as our international software buyer traffic and revenue have been nearly doubling.\u201d And Abel said that his company will also \u201caccelerate\u201d its coverage of the software market with its new capital, along with investments into data work to improve G2\u2019s recommendation engine.\n G2 itself is now valued like a company that\u2019s on an IPO path, which means that the standards we\u2019ll hold it to have reached their zenith.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:05:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,review,g2", "title": "G2\u4e3a\u5176\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5ba1\u6838\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u9ad815700\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tG2 raises $157M for its software review service\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/g2-raises-157m-for-its-software-review-service/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "review", "g2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bb612aedcb5a2e85ff6b4b9eda0a2f53.jpg", "infoid": 1067436, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "6\u670822\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 - \u5b57\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\uff08GOOGL.O\uff09\u8c37\u6b4c\u8ba1\u5212\u5173\u95ed\u4e00\u9879\u957f\u671f\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u8def\u900f\u793e\u6240\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u201c\u5168\u8eab\u652f\u4ed8\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u201d\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u975e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u3002 \u3002\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u786e\u8ba4\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u7528\u4e00\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u5021\u8bae\u53d6\u4ee3\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c45\u4f4f\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u5b83\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u59cb\u7ec8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u5c55\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\u800c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6211\u4eec\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n  \u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u53ca\u5176\u6280\u672f\u884c\u4e1a\u540c\u884c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u62db\u8058\uff0c\u4fc3\u9500\u548c\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u767d\u8272\uff0c\u4e9a\u6d32\u548c\u7537\u6027\u5de5\u4eba\u3002\u81ea\u4ece\u9ed1\u4eba\u751f\u6d3b\u6297\u8bae\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u9605\u8bfb\u66f4\u591a\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u5c45\u4f4f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\uff06\uff0334;

Companies have grown more attuned to concerns about workforce diversity since the Black Lives Matter protests a year ago.   read more\n The Google residency, often referred to as &#34;Eng Res,&#34; has since 2014 given graduates from hundreds of schools a chance to work on different teams, receive training and prove themselves for a permanent job over the course of a year. It offered a cohort of peers for bonding, three former residents said.\n Residents were Google&#39;s &#34;most diverse pool&#34; of software engineers and came &#34;primarily from underrepresented groups,&#34; according to a June 2020 presentation and an accompanying letter to management that one source said over 500 current and former residents signed.\n Compared with other software engineers, residents received the lowest possible pay for their employment level, a smaller year-end bonus and no stock, creating a compensation deficit &#34;in the mid tens of thousands of dollars,&#34; the presentation said.\n Nearly all residents converted to regular employees, according to the presentation. Many alumni years later have continued to feel the &#34;negative effect&#34; of their starting pay on their current salary, it said. Google said it worked to eliminate long-term disparities when hiring residents permanently.\n The letter came after Google  gave big donations to promote racial justice amid the global outcry over the police murder of George Floyd. Black, Latinx and female staff &#34;deserve more than just &#39;the opportunity to be at Google,&#39;&#34; the letter said.\n &#34;Google is willing to invest large sums of money in issues of racial inequity outside of the workplace, but still seems unwilling to address or even acknowledge the role that the Eng Res program plays in enforcing systemic pay inequities,&#34; it said.\n Vice President Maggie Johnson emailed alumni on June 2 saying Google would replace the residency with a new program it was devising for 2022, called Early Career Immersion (ECI). The message, seen by Reuters, did not explain reasons for the switch but said ECI would include mentoring and training.\n The company said the program would provide permanent employment. Concerns about being offered a job made the engineering residency feel &#34;probationary,&#34; the Google employees&#39; presentation said.\n The old program tried to provide &#34;a wide range of high potential engineers&#34; a chance to &#34;hone their skills and gain relevant experience as they start their careers,&#34; Google said in a statement. &#34;Our Early Career Immersion onboarding program will provide a new approach.&#34;\n Google continues to run other fixed-term residencies, including 26-month roles working on internal technical systems and an 18-month program for artificial intelligence researchers.

GV invested $25 million in the round, which also included the company&#39;s existing investors. JoyTunes had previously raised $43 million in three funding rounds. \r     The Israeli startup&#39;s previous round was at the end of 2019 for $25 million led by Tel Aviv-based venture capital firm Qumra Capital with participation from existing investor New York-based venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners.\n  Calcalist also learned that JoyTunes&#39; revenue in 2020 surged to around $100 million, although the company is still believed to not be profitable. Once that happens, JoyTunes is set to target a Wall Street IPO at a far higher valuation. \r       The 150% increase in revenue compared to 2019 is largely attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lengthy lockdowns that left many teenagers and adults searching for online activities. Downloads surged in countries as soon as they entered lockdown, and even though much of the world is beginning to return back to normal, the pandemic has changed consumer habits for good, helping applications like JoyTunes build on the momentum. \r   The company&#39;s apps, Simply Piano and Simply Guitar, help novices learn to play an instrument using AI and algorithms. They have had 10 million downloads worldwide and 1 million songs played every week since the start of the pandemic. Simply Piano is used by hundreds and thousands of students around the world, listed as one of Apple\u2019s \u2018Editor\u2019s Choice\u2019 in its App Store, and voted Best App in Google Play. Its Facebook group, where users can upload and share videos of their progress, has a community of more than 150,000 users with videos racking up thousands of views and reactions. \r   JoyTunes was recently ranked in fourth place in Calcalist&#39;s most promising startups for 2021. The company currently employs 100 people, all of them in Israel. \r   JoyTunes was founded in 2011 by Yigal Kaminka, and Roey Izkovsky, and Yuval Kaminka who serve as the company\u2019s CTO and CEO, respectively. Its technology uses sound recognition technology and AI to develop educational apps for music lovers around the world. Its piano teacher app, Piano Maestro, is used by 10% of American piano teachers.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 20:58:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "joytunes,led", "title": "\u8d44\u6599\u6765\u6e90\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u7684JOYTUNES\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5b66\u4e60\u5409\u4ed6\u548c\u94a2\u7434\uff0c\u4ee5GV\u4e3a11B\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u63d0\u9ad850\u7c73 ", "title_en": "Source: Israel-based JoyTunes, which helps users learn guitar and piano using AI, raises $50M at a $1B valuation led by GV", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3910571,00.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["joytunes", "led"]}]
