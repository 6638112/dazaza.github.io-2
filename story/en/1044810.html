This made it possible to reduce the size of music files without any significant loss of audible sound quality.</p><p> 德国工程师Karlheinz Brandenburg及其同事于1993年首次公开了MP3格式。这使得减小音乐文件的大小成为可能，而不会明显降低可听声音的质量。</p><p> At the time, the music industry was breaking all-time sales records thanks to the CD, but that would soon change.</p><p> 当时，借助CD，音乐行业打破了历来的销售记录，但这种情况很快就会改变。</p><p>  Filmmaker  Jed I. Rosenberg directed a documentary for Bloomberg called “ System Shock” which provides an intriguing and insightful overview of how the “MP3” set in motion a series of events that completely disrupted the music industry.</p><p>  电影制片人杰德·罗森伯格（Jed I. Rosenberg）为彭博社导演了纪录片《系统冲击》，该片对“ MP3”如何引发一系列事件产生了深刻而深刻的概述，这些事件彻底破坏了音乐产业。</p><p>  While we recommend everyone to watch all three parts in full, we’ll highlight some quotes in the article below.</p><p>  我们建议大家都完整地观看所有三个部分，但在下面的文章中，我们将突出显示一些引述。</p><p> After Brandenburg published the MP3 format it didn’t take long before hobbyists started using it to rip CDs. Some people shared or traded these files with friends, which initially happened mostly offline. However, little by little these MP3s made their way onto the Internet.</p><p> 勃兰登堡（Brandenburg）发布MP3格式后不久，业余爱好者便开始使用它来翻录CD。有些人与朋友共享或交易了这些文件，这些文件最初大多是在离线状态下发生的。但是，这些MP3逐渐进入Internet。</p><p>  These new developments didn’t go unnoticed by the music industry. The RIAA’s former CEO, Hilary Rosen, recalls that they mostly viewed compressed music as an opportunity.</p><p>  音乐行业并不忽视这些新发展。 RIAA的前首席执行官希拉里·罗森（Hilary Rosen）回忆说，他们大多将压缩音乐视为机遇。 </p><p> “In the late ’90s, my staff started monitoring the online space and we really did see a significant amount of interest in MP3 all of a sudden because of its ability to compress a music file.</p><p>“在90年代后期，我的工作人员开始监视在线空间，我们确实确实突然间对MP3产生了极大的兴趣，因为它具有压缩音乐文件的能力。</p><p> “I think there really wasn’t any sort of panic in the industry in the early days. My team did look at it and saw it as not really as much of a threat as an opportunity,” Rosen said.</p><p> “我认为行业初期确实没有任何恐慌。我的团队确实看到了这一点，并认为它实际上没有带来太大的威胁，”罗森说。</p><p>  In the late 90s, before the file-sharing boom had started, music industry insiders had already toyed with the idea of a ‘celestial jukebox’ that could access all music in the world.</p><p>  在90年代后期，在文件共享热潮开始之前，音乐行业内部人士就已经开始设想一种“天文自动点唱机”，可以访问世界上所有音乐。</p><p> The RIAA realized that with compression, this jukebox idea would move nearer to reality, a position that was shared by others.</p><p> RIAA意识到，通过压缩，自动点唱机的想法将更接近于现实，这一立场已为他人所认同。</p><p> “The ‘celestial jukebox’ was a theoretical construct at the time,” Al Teller, a former executive at MCA Records and CBS records recalls. “Every song ever made was gonna be in what we call the cloud right now, and would be instantaneously available to anyone on the planet simply by pressing a button on your gizmo.”</p><p> MCA Records和CBS Records的前高管Al Teller回忆说：“当时的天体点唱机是一种理论结构。” “现在所制作的每首歌曲都将出现在我们现在所说的云中，只要按一下Gizmo上的按钮，地球上的任何人都可以立即使用它。”</p><p> While the music industry ‘thought’ about it, there was little need to innovate at that time. The surge in CD sales resulted in record-breaking revenues year after year, and computers were seen as spreadsheet and word-processing tools by most people.</p><p> 尽管音乐界对此有所“思考”，但那时几乎不需要创新。 CD销量的激增导致创纪录的年复一年的收入，而计算机被大多数人视为电子表格和文字处理工具。</p><p>  This all changed when a young student named Shawn Fanning came up with Napster. At the time, Fanning and Sean Parker were already sharing MP3s on IRC channels, but Fanning envisioned something bigger. A central database that everyone in the world could access.</p><p>  当一个名叫肖恩·范宁（Shawn Fanning）的年轻学生想出Napster时，一切都改变了。当时，范宁和肖恩·帕克已经在IRC频道上共享MP3，但是范宁设想了更大的东西。世界上每个人都可以访问的中央数据库。 </p><p>  To realize this dream Fanning stopped going to school. He set everything aside for months and didn’t stop until the first version of Napster saw the light. That moment came in 1999. Soon after, it went viral.</p><p>为了实现这个梦想，范宁停止上学。他将所有内容搁置了几个月，直到第一版Napster见到光，他才停下来。那一刻发生在1999年。不久之后，它开始传播开来。</p><p> The documentary shows how millions of people flocked to the new app. Some people, mostly teenagers, were completely consumed by it and downloaded thousands of MP3s just because they could.</p><p> 纪录片显示了成千上万的人涌向新应用。一些人，大多数是青少年，完全被它消耗了，并下载了成千上万的MP3，只是因为他们可以这样做。</p><p>  “My head of anti-piracy, Frank Creighton, came into my office and said, ‘I’ve just found the most fascinating thing.’ It was Napster,” Former RIAA CEO Rosen recalls.</p><p>  RIAA前首席执行官罗森回忆说：“我的反盗版负责人弗兰克·克赖顿（Frank Creighton）来到我的办公室，说：‘我发现的最有趣的东西。是纳普斯特（Napster）。”</p><p> Rosen immediately tried Napster and put in a search for Madonna’s ‘Holiday’ that returned plenty of results.</p><p> 罗森立即尝试使用Napster并搜索了麦当娜的“假日”，该搜索返回了很多结果。</p><p> “I was like, ‘Whoa, that’s pretty amazing.’ That’s like the celestial jukebox. We’ve been talking about this for years.”</p><p> “我当时想，‘哇，真是太神奇了。’就像天文点唱机一样。我们谈论这个问题已有多年了。”</p><p> After the initial excitement sunk in, Rosen realized that Napster was a treasure trove of pirated content. She reached out to Napster in an effort to have the infringing content removed, starting with the Billboard 200. Napster said it would try to help, but nothing really happened.</p><p> 最初的兴奋沉入后，罗森意识到纳普斯特是盗版内容的宝库。她与Napster取得了联系，努力从Billboard 200开始删除侵权内容。Napster表示会尽力提供帮助，但实际上没有任何反应。</p><p>  In the months that followed, the file-sharing revolution grew and grew. The music industry shifted to panic mode and in February 2000 all major label executives discussed the threat during an RIAA board meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.</p><p>  在随后的几个月中，文件共享革命不断发展。音乐行业转向恐慌模式，2000年2月，所有主要唱片公司高管在洛杉矶四季节酒店举行的RIAA董事会会议上讨论了这一威胁。 </p><p> “I will never forget this day. All of the heads of the labels, literally the titans of the music business, were in that room. I had somebody wheel in a PC and put some speakers up and I started doing a name that tune,” Rosen says.</p><p>“我永远不会忘记这一天。所有唱片公司的负责人，实际上是音乐界的巨头，都在那个房间里。罗森说：“我有人轮到PC上了，并放了一些扬声器，然后我开始做一个调子。”</p><p> The major music bosses started to name tracks, including some that weren’t even released yet, and time and again Napster would come up with results. Needless to say, the board was terrified.</p><p> 主要的音乐老板开始命名曲目，包括尚未发行的曲目，而Napster一次又一次提出结果。不用说，董事会很害怕。</p><p> “We used to have this line in the record business that there was sort of nothing a good hit couldn’t fix. There was no screw up a good hit couldn’t fix. There was no amount of money lost on a deal that a good hit couldn’t fix.</p><p> “我们以前在唱片业中有这条线，那就是好唱片无法解决。没有一个好办法无法解决。没有一笔大笔交易无法弥补的金钱损失。</p><p> “I think that was the moment when people said, ‘Ooh, maybe a good hit can’t fix this one’,” Rosen added.</p><p> 罗森补充说：“我认为那是人们说‘噢，也许好打不能解决这个问题’的那一刻。”</p><p>  While the big music bosses were scared, others saw opportunities. Not just the pirates, but also artists who used Napster to deliver their music directly to the rest of the world. They included rapper  Benefit, for whom Napster was a  major breakthrough.</p><p>  当大型音乐老板感到害怕时，其他人却看到了机会。不仅是海盗，而且还有使用Napster将音乐直接传播到世界各地的艺术家。他们包括说唱歌手Benefit，Napster对此是一个重大突破。</p><p>  Benefit entered and won a contest organized by Public Enemy’s  Chuck D, who himself was a major supporter of Napster. He was one of the first major musicians to argue that this could be good for artists.</p><p>  Benefit参加了比赛，并赢得了由公共敌手Chuck D组织的比赛，他本人是Napster的主要支持者。他是最早认为这可能对艺术家有益的主要音乐家之一。</p><p> “I look at Napster as being new radio and people are finding ways that now you’re going to have a million artists, and a million labels, now all in the record game,” Chuck D said at the time.</p><p> “我认为Napster是一台新兴的广播电台，人们正在寻找方法，现在您将拥有一百万个艺术家和一百万个唱片公司，现在所有唱片公司都在唱片中，” Chuck D当时说。 </p><p> The major labels and the band Metalica clearly disagreed and famously sued Napster. This resulted in public outrage including massive protests, but eventually the court decided that Napster had to stop the copyright infringement. The company later shut down its servers, barely two years after the first launch.</p><p>主要唱片公司和Metalica乐队显然不同意并以Napster起诉。这导致了包括大规模抗议在内的公众愤慨，但最终法院裁定Napster必须停止侵犯版权。该公司后来在第一次启动后仅两年就关闭了服务器。</p><p>  The problems for the music industry didn’t stop there. Soon, new and better file-sharing tools popped up, and these became increasingly decentralized. Fromm Kazaa, through Morpheus to LimeWire, music sharing was suddenly unstoppable.</p><p>  音乐行业的问题并不仅限于此。不久，出现了新的更好的文件共享工具，这些工具越来越分散。 Fromm Kazaa，通过Morpheus到LimeWire，音乐共享突然变得势不可挡。</p><p> The problem was that the music industry didn’t really have a good alternative. There was no digital equivalent of the music store yet, as Larry Kenswill, a former executive at Universal Music Group, explains:</p><p> 问题在于音乐界真的没有很好的选择。环球唱片集团的前高管拉里·肯斯威尔（Larry Kenswill）解释说，音乐商店还没有类似的数字产品：</p><p> “The huge, huge problem at the time is that it was very hard to tell people not to use peer-to-peer methods and they’ll say, well, what should we use? And the answer was, go to a record store and buy a CD. That’s not what they wanted to hear.”</p><p> “当时的巨大问题是，很难告诉人们不要使用点对点方法，他们会说，我们应该使用什么？答案是，去唱片店买一张CD。那不是他们想听到的。”</p><p>  The labels were desperately looking for a solution and just around that time Steve Jobs, who had just returned to Apple, entered the scene. Apple had their iPod and was secretly working on its own music store.</p><p>  唱片公司拼命寻找解决方案，而就在那时，刚回到苹果的史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）进入了现场。苹果拥有iPod，并且正在秘密地经营自己的音乐商店。</p><p>  In late 2002 Jobs reached out to the major labels to share his plan. Several major executives were invited to Cupertino where Apple’s CEO personally gave an hour-long demo of the iTunes store.</p><p>  2002年底，乔布斯与主要唱片公司联系，分享他的计划。苹果公司的首席执行官亲自邀请了几位主要高管到库比蒂诺（Cupertino），苹果首席执行官亲自进行了一个小时的iTunes商店演示。</p><p> “It worked better than anything we’d ever seen before. And it became obvious this, this was a good thing to go with,” Kenswill recalls. “The one thing of course about the iTunes music store, he wanted every song to be a buck.”</p><p> “它的工作比以往任何时候都要好。显而易见，这是一件好事，”肯斯威尔回忆道。 “当然，关于iTunes音乐商店的一件事，他希望每首歌都能赚钱。” </p><p>  With this demand, Steve Jobs arguably changed the music business more than pirates did. It meant that a song couldn’t cost more than a dollar and tracks would become unbundled from a full album.</p><p>有了这种需求，史蒂夫·乔布斯可以说比海盗更能改变音乐业务。这意味着一首歌的价格不会超过一美元，而且曲目会从完整专辑中解开。</p><p> While this sounds reasonable today, it was a revolution back then. For decades artists have sold full albums even though many people were only interested in a few tracks at most. This generated heaps of excess revenue. With iTunes, that model changed. And the money too.</p><p> 虽然今天听起来很合理，但那是一次革命。几十年来，即使很多人最多只对几首曲目感兴趣，但艺人已经售出了完整专辑。这产生了大量的超额收入。使用iTunes，该模型发生了变化。还有钱。</p><p> “The unbundling of albums meant that the revenue that came in was significantly diminished,” Rosen says.</p><p> 罗森说：“专辑的捆绑销售意味着收入大大减少了。”</p><p> While much of the decline in music sales revenue has been blamed on piracy, it can be argued that the move to digital downloads and the unbundling that came with it had a much bigger impact. This is something we already argued  over a decade ago.</p><p> 虽然音乐销售收入的下降大部分归咎于盗版，但可以说，向数字下载的转移以及随之而来的捆绑带来了更大的影响。这是我们十年前已经争论过的事情。</p><p> While iTunes did well, there were still plenty of people pirating music. Apple’s store didn’t provide the ‘celestial jukebox’ experience pirate apps had, simply because most people could not afford to fill up their MP3 players legally.</p><p> 尽管iTunes表现不错，但仍有很多人在盗版音乐。苹果商店没有提供盗版应用提供的“天文自动点唱机”体验，仅仅是因为大多数人无力合法地购买MP3播放器。</p><p>  Faced with a rampant music piracy boom the RIAA decided to go to court again. This time they were not targeting the creators of file-sharing tools, but the people who downloaded tracks.</p><p>  面对猖pi的音乐盗版热潮，RIAA决定再次提起诉讼。这次，他们的目标不是文件共享工具的创建者，而是下载轨道的人。</p><p> This idea was controversial, also within the RIAA, and CEO Hilary Rosen even resigned over the matter.</p><p> 这个想法在RIAA内也引起争议，首席执行官希拉里·罗森（Hilary Rosen）甚至就此事辞职。 </p><p> “I didn’t want us to go against individuals, even though they were the source of a huge amount of illegal activity, I felt like ultimately they were still music fans. But essentially I was kind of overruled.</p><p>“即使他们是大量非法活动的源头，我也不希望我们与个人对立，我觉得最终他们仍然是音乐迷。但从本质上讲，我有点被否决了。</p><p> “My last day at the RIAA was the day before the litigation against individuals started,” Rosen adds.</p><p> “我在RIAA的最后一天是对个人提起诉讼的前一天，” Rosen补充道。</p><p> The lawsuits became a trainwreck, especially because thousands of people seemed to be randomly targeted. Some may have been prolific downloaders, but the RIAA also sued ‘dead people,’ grandmas, and other unlikely targets.</p><p> 这些诉讼成了一场沉船事故，特别是因为成千上万的人似乎是随机目标。其中一些下载者可能是多产的下载者，但RIAA还起诉了“死者”，“祖母”和其他不太可能的目标。</p><p>  Meanwhile, piracy wasn’t stopping. Stephen Witt, author of the book “How Music Got Free,” argues that the lawsuits only made things worse. This is corroborated by musician Nick Koenig, who was one of the RIAA’s targets at the time.</p><p>  同时，盗版活动没有停止。 《音乐如何自由》一书的作者斯蒂芬·维特（Stephen Witt）认为，诉讼只会使事情变得更糟。音乐家尼克·科尼格（Nick Koenig）证实了这一点，他当时是RIAA的目标之一。</p><p> “I ended up having to pay like, I think close to a thousand dollars to the RIAA. But in the end, I ended up recouping my losses by downloading overtime and doubling down,” Koenig says.</p><p> “我最终不得不向RIAA支付近一千美元。但是最后，我最终通过加班下载和加倍下载来弥补损失。”科尼格说。</p><p>  Around the mid-2000s the lawsuits had ended. It was the time when torrent sites started to dominate the piracy scene and these became even more popular when LimeWire shut down.</p><p>  在2000年代中期左右，诉讼已经结束。那时洪流站点开始主导盗版现场，而当LimeWire关闭时，这些站点变得更加流行。</p><p>  A BitTorrent client named uTorrent became particularly popular, up to the point where its creator, Ludvig Strigeus, sold it. That money was then used for another startup that would shake up the music industry: Spotify.</p><p>  一个名为uTorrent的BitTorrent客户特别受欢迎，直到其创建者Ludvig Strigeus出售了它。然后，这笔钱被用于另一家将撼动音乐产业的创业公司：Spotify。 </p><p> When Spotify first went public in a few select countries in late 2008, we joined the ‘invite-only’ platform to see what it was all about.  We were blown away.</p><p>当Spotify于2008年底在几个特定国家/地区首次公开发行时，我们加入了“仅邀请”平台以了解其全部内容。我们被吹走了。</p><p> Having all music tracks available for streaming was another Napster moment. Or perhaps it was better than Napster. It was the ‘celestial jukebox’ the music industry could only dream about a decade earlier.</p><p> Napster的另一个时刻就是让所有音乐曲目都可以流式传输。也许它比Napster更好。音乐界只能梦想大约十年前的“天文自动点唱机”。</p><p>  While Spotify and other platforms are great for users, not all artists are happy. Especially those who have to share a big chunk of their revenue with labels. But even for independent artists, the revenues are rather limited.</p><p>  虽然Spotify和其他平台非常适合用户，但并非所有艺术家都满意。特别是那些必须与标签分享大部分收入的人。但是即使对于独立艺术家，收入也相当有限。</p><p> The documentary goes on to show how recorded music sales transformed from being the primary source of income to more of a promotional tool. Increasingly, musicians had to rely on other means such as concerts, merchandising, Bandcamp, or even Patreon to earn a decent living.</p><p> 纪录片继续展示录制的音乐销售如何从收入的主要来源转变为更多的促销工具。越来越多的音乐家不得不依靠音乐会，推销，Bandcamp甚至Patreon等其他手段谋生。</p><p>  For older musicians, this isn’t easy. There’s an idea that music has lost its value. At the same time, unbundling and on-demand streaming are seen as desecrating the art of an album as a whole.</p><p>  对于年长的音乐家来说，这并不容易。有人认为音乐已经失去了价值。同时，取消捆绑和按需流式传输被视为亵渎了整个专辑的艺术。</p><p> For labels, things have changed as well. Their monopolies are starting to crumble. While they still serve a purpose, artists are increasingly able to make it on their own. This is in part thanks to the many public outlets that are available today, where they can easily record, publish, and promote their work.</p><p> 对于标签，情况也发生了变化。他们的垄断开始崩溃。尽管它们仍然可以达到目的，但艺术家越来越有能力自己实现目标。在某种程度上，这要归功于当今可用的许多公共场所，它们可以轻松地记录，发布和推广他们的作品。</p><p> Those independent artists can keep more revenue for themselves. This is a topic we  addressed in the past and in the documentary, rapper  R.A. the Rugged Man brings this up too.</p><p> 那些独立的艺术家可以自己赚更多的钱。这是我们过去和纪录片说唱歌手R.A.中谈到的主题。坚固耐用的人也提出了这一点。 </p><p> “It got to the point where I hated my label. So I said, Hey, I’m going to run and do this myself. And when I started doing independent records that’s when all my money started coming in. And that’s where all my success started coming in. And that’s where all of my fans started coming in.”</p><p>“到了我讨厌我的标签的地步。所以我说，嘿，我要自己跑步去做。当我开始制作独立唱片时，那就是我所有的钱都开始流入的地方。那就是我所有的成功开始出现的地方。那就是我所有的粉丝开始进入的地方。”</p><p>  At the same time, new technology also presents opportunities that, until recently, have never existed. For example, services such as Spotify can target concert promotions at a specific set of fans, be used to scout talent for festivals, and help users discover new content based on their musical taste.</p><p>  同时，新技术也带来了直到最近还不存在的机会。例如，诸如Spotify之类的服务可以将音乐会促销活动瞄准特定的粉丝群，用来发掘音乐节的才华，并根据用户的音乐品味帮助用户发现新内容。</p><p> New technologies also allow fans and musicians to get in direct contact. And without the middlemen, having 1000 passionate fans can already be enough to make a decent living, as DJ and music journalist  Dani Deahl notes.</p><p> 新技术还使歌迷和音乐家可以直接接触。正如DJ和音乐记者Dani Deahl所指出的，没有中间人，拥有1000名热情的粉丝就已经足以过上体面的生活。</p><p> And who says that things will stop here? Streaming subscription platforms are the norm today, but these may be outdated again in the future. Looking back, it seems fair to conclude that piracy hasn’t destroyed the music industry, it mostly helped to get closer to the ‘celestial jukebox.’</p><p> 谁说事情会在这里停止呢？流媒体订阅平台已成为当今的规范，但将来可能会过时。回顾过去，似乎可以得出这样的结论：盗版并没有摧毁音乐产业，它在很大程度上帮助人们接近了“自动点唱机”。</p><p> The MP3 played a crucial role in this process. It was the catalyst that helped to shift the powers in the music business. This has hurt some companies and musicians, but also helped many others.</p><p> MP3在此过程中起着至关重要的作用。正是催化剂推动了音乐业务的力量转移。这伤害了一些公司和音乐家，但也帮助了许多其他公司。</p><p> The “System Shock” documentary fittingly ends with a quote from the MP3’s co-inventor Karlheinz Brandenburg looking back, so we’ll do the same.</p><p> “ System Shock”纪录片的结尾恰好是MP3的共同发明者Karlheinz Brandenburg的一句话，所以我们将照做。</p><p> “I had the feeling, this is not good for the music industry. But in the end, I think it changed for the better,” Brandenburg says.</p><p> “我有种感觉，这对音乐行业不利。但最终，我认为情况有所好转。”勃兰登堡说。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-mp3-pirates-and-apple-changed-the-music-industry-210117/">https://torrentfreak.com/how-the-mp3-pirates-and-apple-changed-the-music-industry-210117/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mp3/">#mp3</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/盗版/">#盗版</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/pirates/">#pirates</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
