His cubicle looked identical to the other eighty or so scattered around the room except for the custom-built mechanical keyboard with unmarked keycaps and neon-backlight sitting on his desk. We&#39;d been getting along great, but now he was looking back at me with an expression of betrayal on his face that told me exactly what he was thinking: “Please tell me you haven’t wasted my entire Saturday.”</p><p>登录表单下方的红色文本为&#34；意外错误&#34; 我正从一位名叫埃里克的技术支持人员的身后看过去，他刚刚第一次尝试登录我们的产品。他的隔间看起来和房间里其他大约80个分散的隔间一模一样，只是办公桌上有一个定制的机械键盘，上面有没有标记的键帽和霓虹灯背光。我们&#39；我一直过得很好，但现在他回头看着我，脸上露出背叛的表情，告诉我他在想什么：“请告诉我，你没有浪费我整个周六的时间。”</p><p> I turned around and felt my throat tighten as I saw the same error message appearing all around the room and his colleagues starting to look up in confusion.</p><p>我转过身，感觉自己喉咙发紧，因为我看到房间里到处都是同样的错误信息，他的同事们开始困惑地抬起头来。</p><p>  It was a sweltering Saturday morning in Houston in 2018, and I was in the network operations center for an IT managed service provider (MSP). MSPs manage IT as a service for other businesses - everything from domains and websites, email and cloud services, to security operations and network infrastructure.</p><p>2018年，休斯顿的一个闷热的周六上午，我在一家It管理服务提供商（MSP）的网络运营中心工作。MSP将IT作为一项服务来管理其他业务——从域和网站、电子邮件和云服务，到安全运营和网络基础设施。</p><p> This company was one of our first ever customers and by far the largest. We&#39;d organized a weekend training session for their support team to learn how to use our startup&#39;s web app to rapidly locate information about the systems they managed so that they could respond more efficiently to support requests. But now, only a handful of them could even log in, and as I walked between the cubicles seeing the same error pop up on every screen I passed, I could feel frustration starting to buzz around the room.</p><p>这家公司是我们最早的客户之一，也是迄今为止最大的客户之一。我们&#39；d为他们的支持团队组织了一次周末培训课程，学习如何使用我们的初创公司&39；s的web应用程序可以快速定位有关他们管理的系统的信息，以便他们能够更高效地响应支持请求。但现在，只有少数人甚至可以登录，当我在隔间之间走动时，看到我经过的每个屏幕上都出现了相同的错误，我感到沮丧，开始在房间里嗡嗡作响。</p><p> Our CEO waved me over. &#34;Hey man, it looks like we have a problem.&#34; He was projecting calm as always, but his smile was forced. Even though he said “we” he meant “you” because it was definitely  my problem. Despite joining the team just a few months ago, I was one of just two software engineers in the entire eight-person company at the time and the only one in the room that day.</p><p>我们的首席执行官向我挥手致意&#34;嘿，伙计，看来我们有麻烦了&#34; 他一如既往地表现出镇定，但他的微笑是被迫的。尽管他说“我们”，但他的意思是“你”，因为这肯定是我的问题。尽管几个月前才加入这个团队，但当时我是整个八人公司中仅有的两名软件工程师之一，也是当天唯一一名。</p><p> That&#39;s how I found myself desperately hunched over my laptop, hands shaking, searching through a codebase that still felt foreign to me, and wracking my brain. This exact build had worked fine when we were testing it during the past week. What was different about today? Why couldn&#39;t anybody log in?</p><p>那&#39；这就是为什么我发现自己绝望地蜷缩在笔记本电脑前，双手颤抖，在一个对我来说仍然陌生的代码库中搜索，折磨着我的大脑。在过去一周的测试中，这个精确的构建工作得很好。今天有什么不同？为什么不能&#39；没有人登录吗？</p><p> Every second felt like an eternity as I tried to keep my rising panic at bay. “Focus, you can do this,” I told myself. The error message was generic and unhelpful in narrowing down the problem, but I knew the issue must have something to do with the login functionality because that&#39;s where people were getting stuck.</p><p>每一秒都像是一个永恒的时刻，我试图控制住自己日益加剧的恐慌。“专注，你能做到，”我告诉自己。错误消息是通用的，对缩小问题范围没有帮助，但我知道问题一定与登录功能有关，因为&#39；这是人们陷入困境的地方。</p><p> Then it hit me. Today was the first time we&#39;d ever had a large group of people accessing the product simultaneously. I was still learning the codebase, but I knew we had some half-baked security feature setup to prevent too many bad login attempts. Sure enough, when I logged into the database, I could see that we were incorrectly tracking the total number of login attempts. Instead of counting per user, it was counting each attempt across the whole system. Gigantic facepalm.</p><p>然后它击中了我。今天是我们第一次&#39；d曾经有一大群人同时访问该产品。我还在学习代码库，但我知道我们有一些不成熟的安全功能设置，以防止太多错误的登录尝试。果不其然，当我登录数据库时，我可以看到我们错误地跟踪了登录尝试的总数。它不是计算每个用户的次数，而是计算整个系统中的每次尝试次数。巨大的掌心。</p><p> I called the other engineer on the team to confirm what I was seeing and that what I was about to do wasn&#39;t completely crazy, and then fired off the command to wipe the table that tracked these attempts. The table emptied. I asked Eric to try to login again and held my breath as I listened to his clacking keyboard. A second later, the dashboard of our product appeared on his screen. &#34;I&#39;m in!&#34; he exclaimed.</p><p>我打电话给团队中的另一位工程师，确认我看到了什么，我要做的不是&#39；t完全疯了，然后启动命令，清除跟踪这些尝试的表。桌子空了。我让埃里克再次尝试登录，我屏住呼吸，听着他键盘的咔嗒声。一秒钟后，我们产品的仪表盘出现在他的屏幕上&#34;我&#39；我加入&#34; 他喊道。</p><p> Relief flooded me as I heard someone behind me say &#34;I just got in too. It’s working now.”</p><p>当我听到身后有人说&#34；我也刚进去。它现在起作用了。"</p><p> For the rest of the morning, I walked around the room answering questions, and occasionally crouching down behind a cubicle to discreetly re-wipe both the database table and the sweat off my forehead, grinning to myself at the ridiculousness of the situation. Despite our near-disaster, the training ended up being a success.</p><p>上午剩下的时间里，我在房间里走来走去回答问题，偶尔蹲在一间小隔间后面，小心翼翼地重新擦拭数据库表和额头上的汗水，对这种荒谬的情况对自己咧嘴大笑。尽管我们险些遭遇灾难，但训练最终还是取得了成功。</p><p> It&#39;s been three and a half years since that day, and it feels like that time passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>它&#39；从那天起已经三年半了，感觉时间一眨眼就过去了。</p><p> In-person Saturday training sessions have been replaced by monthly feature update webinars, a Slack community, bi-weekly customer onboarding calls, and an outstanding documentation site to support more than 1500 MSPs and tens of thousands of users globally. The product that began as a bowl of digital spaghetti has transformed into a collection of well-tested microservices that can scale to collecting tens of terabytes of configuration data. Our backlog used to be so short it fit on a whiteboard. Now our product management team maintains a year-long roadmap and meets with users daily to collect usability feedback. And our engineering team has grown into a delivery machine with a mature software development lifecycle.</p><p>周六的亲自培训课程已经被每月的功能更新网络研讨会、一个松弛的社区、每两周一次的客户入职电话和一个优秀的文档网站所取代，该网站支持全球1500多个MSP和数万用户。该产品最初只是一碗数字意大利面，现在已经转变为一系列经过良好测试的微服务，可以扩展到收集数十TB的配置数据。我们的待办事项过去很短，可以放在白板上。现在，我们的产品管理团队制定了一年的路线图，并每天与用户会面，收集可用性反馈。我们的工程团队已经成长为具有成熟软件开发生命周期的交付机器。</p><p> In other words, if you were looking at the team and the company today, you would be forgiven for believing that we knew what we were doing all along. You&#39;d also definitely have trouble imagining just how fragile and humble things in the early days were. Sometimes I even have trouble remembering it objectively myself, and I was there! That&#39;s why I love this story. It helps me remember more clearly despite the rosy haze of nostalgia.</p><p>换句话说，如果你今天看到的是团队和公司，你相信我们知道我们一直在做什么是可以原谅的。你&#39；d当然也很难想象早期的事物是多么脆弱和卑微。有时我自己甚至难以客观地记住它，而我当时就在那里！那&#39；这就是为什么我喜欢这个故事。它帮助我更清楚地记得，尽管怀旧的迷雾是玫瑰色的。</p><p>  They were hard because everything was so uncertain. When I joined, there were just five of us: the two founders, a sales guy, an engineer who had been building out a prototype of the core product over the past six months or so, and me. We didn&#39;t have any funding, the product was barely functional, we didn&#39;t have any paying customers yet, and we didn&#39;t know what we needed to do to get them.</p><p>他们很艰难，因为一切都很不确定。当我加入时，我们只有五个人：两位创始人、一位销售人员、一位工程师，他在过去六个月左右的时间里一直在构建核心产品的原型，还有我。我们没有&#39；没有任何资金，产品几乎没有功能，我们没有&#39；我们还没有付费客户，我们也没有&#39；我不知道我们需要做什么才能得到他们。</p><p> This uncertainty created tension. The sales guy wanted to build more data collectors, the founders wanted to focus on platform integrations, and we engineers wanted to over engineer a graph database for storing IT configurations. We were working as fast as possible and creating a graveyard of technical debt in our wake. Everybody cared, everybody wanted to make it work, and everybody was smart and headstrong, which meant that we each would start tugging in the direction we thought things needed to go. I assume this happens a lot in early-stage startups, and the only ones that survive this have founders that have a strong vision and can sell that vision to the early team. It&#39;s a cliche for a reason: if you can&#39;t all start rowing in the same direction, you won&#39;t make any forward progress.</p><p>这种不确定性造成了紧张局势。销售人员希望构建更多的数据采集器，创始人希望专注于平台集成，我们工程师希望过度设计用于存储IT配置的图形数据库。我们正以尽可能快的速度工作，并在这之后创造了一个技术债务的坟墓。每个人都很关心，每个人都想让它发挥作用，每个人都很聪明和任性，这意味着我们每个人都会开始朝着我们认为需要的方向努力。我认为这种情况在早期创业公司中经常发生，只有那些在这种情况下幸存下来的创业者有着强烈的愿景，并且能够将这种愿景推销给早期团队。它&#39；这是一个陈词滥调，原因是：如果可以&#39；不要都朝同一个方向划船，你赢了&#39；我没有取得任何进展。</p><p> Fortunately, the founders did have a powerful vision for the product they wanted to build. Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t create it all overnight, so it felt like the engineering priorities shifted almost daily. We had many features that were only half-implemented, brittle, or buggy. We were continually hammering on different parts of the product, slowly beating it into shape, and simultaneously they were actively meeting with prospects and trying to close our first deal. We were trying to meet in the middle -- get the product to &#34;useful enough&#34; to where somebody would be willing to pay for it.</p><p>幸运的是，创始人确实对他们想要开发的产品有着强大的愿景。不幸的是，我们不能&#39；我们无法在一夜之间完成这一切，所以感觉工程优先级几乎每天都在变化。我们有很多功能只是实现了一半，很脆弱，或者有缺陷。我们不断地敲打产品的不同部分，慢慢地将其敲定，同时他们积极地与潜在客户会面，并试图完成我们的第一笔交易。我们试图在中间相遇-得到产品到& 34；足够有用&#34；去有人愿意付钱的地方。</p><p> I remember being dumbstruck when we closed our first deal because I knew just how buggy and brittle the product was at that time. But I realized that most of those early customers weren’t buying because the product worked so much as they were buying into the vision for what we were trying to build. Our earliest customers were like an extension of the team in this way. A drip of validation was addicting, and it sustained us for a little bit longer. So we kept listening to our customers, and kept iterating on the product. The product got better, and the drip of new customers became a trickle.</p><p>我记得当我们达成第一笔交易时，我目瞪口呆，因为我知道当时的产品有多笨重和脆弱。但我意识到，大多数早期的客户并没有购买产品，因为他们购买的是我们试图构建的愿景。我们最早的客户就像是团队的延伸。一滴验证让人上瘾，它让我们持续了更长的时间。因此，我们不断听取客户的意见，并不断对产品进行迭代。产品越来越好，新客户的点滴变成了涓涓细流。</p><p> In those days, there was tremendous pressure on engineering. Nobody knew for sure which piece of the roadmap we should bite off next and how polished it needed to be until somebody would buy it, and we had about 2% of the bandwidth that we needed to finish all the tasks in our queue anyway.</p><p>在那些日子里，工程学面临着巨大的压力。没有人确切地知道我们下一步应该啃掉路线图的哪一部分，以及在有人购买它之前它需要有多精致，而且我们有大约2%的带宽来完成队列中的所有任务。</p><p> In the beginning, I used to tell myself, &#34;as soon as we solve this, we&#39;ll be able to take our foot off the gas just a little bit.&#34; This was a fallacy. The challenge currently facing us was simply obscuring the endless future challenges queued up behind it. Once we got our first couple of customers, we quickly shifted from pure &#34;execution-and-delivery&#34; mode to &#34;keep-doing-that-but-also-fix-all-these-damn-bugs-or-we-might-lose-this-customer&#34; mode.</p><p>一开始，我常常告诉自己，&#34；一旦我们解决了这个问题，我们&#39；我们就可以稍微少踩油门了&#34; 这是一种谬论。我们目前面临的挑战只是掩盖了它背后无休止的未来挑战。一旦我们得到了第一批客户，我们很快就从单纯的&#34；执行和交付&#34；模式为&#34；继续这样做，但也要修复所有这些该死的错误，否则我们可能会失去这个客户&#34；模式</p><p> In fairness, this pressure was self-imposed versus a toxic work environment. We didn’t want to let our teammates down, and this made it feel like the world was on our shoulders and led to more than my fair share of anxiety attacks when the product broke. One time a new customer imported a CSV of 50,000 users into his instance accidentally, burning through an AWS Service limit and completely hanging the instance up for the afternoon. A few months later, there was a four-day stretch where I was woken up by our monitoring alarm at 3 AM and had to crawl out of bed to get the app back online and then obsess the rest of the day over finding the root cause. These were challenging but invaluable learning experiences. Nothing burns the importance of observability into you more than a week of sleep deprivation and stress.</p><p>公平地说，这种压力是自我施加的，而不是有害的工作环境。我们不想让我们的队友失望，这让我们感觉整个世界都在我们的肩上，当产品坏了的时候，我的焦虑症发作的比例超过了我应得的比例。有一次，一位新客户意外地将50000个用户的CSV导入到他的实例中，烧穿了AWS服务限制，并在下午完全挂断了该实例。几个月后，有一段四天的时间，凌晨3点，我被监控警报吵醒，不得不爬下床让应用重新上线，然后一整天都在纠结于寻找根本原因。这些都是具有挑战性但非常宝贵的学习经历。没有什么比一周的睡眠剥夺和压力更能让你感受到观察力的重要性了。</p><p> Even though it was a pressure cooker, there was nothing more fun than being in the trenches with the early team. Everybody was working so hard. The vision was ambitious and exciting, and it felt like we could see a future that hardly anybody else seemed to be able to see. It was exhilarating to finally have some customers that were truly getting value out of the product.</p><p>尽管这是一个压力锅，但没有什么比和早期团队一起在战壕里更有趣的了。每个人都在努力工作。这一愿景雄心勃勃，令人兴奋，感觉我们可以看到一个几乎没有其他人能够看到的未来。终于有了一些真正从产品中获得价值的客户，这真是令人振奋。</p><p> After we found some traction and raised some money, we started growing the team. The first few people we hired back then always came from our personal networks. They either were people we encountered at the co-working space, consulting with us already, or they were an old friend or acquaintance.</p><p>在我们找到了一些动力并筹集了一些资金后，我们开始发展团队。当时我们雇佣的最初几个人总是来自我们的个人网络。他们要么是我们在合作空间遇到的人，已经和我们商量过了，要么是老朋友或熟人。</p><p> Once we got a little bigger, we began hiring outside our networks. That was a lot harder and time-consuming (especially for engineering hiring) because we needed to write job requisitions, advertise positions, get familiar with an applicant tracking system, and formalize our interview loops. It took us six months to land our first outside-of-network engineering hire. Before that, we had two candidates get to the offer stage only to realize that they weren&#39;t that serious about joining our team and had been going through the hiring pipeline for practice and to use our offer as leverage. It was a good learning experience, but it was demoralizing to be on the receiving end of that. Don’t do this, especially to small startups where time and energy are limited. Anyway, hiring got easier after we built out our applicant funnel and the profile of the company started to grow. Once we hired a few solid folks, our collective network grew and we started getting referrals again.</p><p>一旦我们变得更大，我们就开始在我们的网络之外招聘。这是一个非常困难和耗时的过程（尤其是对于工程招聘），因为我们需要编写工作申请、发布职位广告、熟悉申请人跟踪系统，并使我们的面试循环正式化。我们花了六个月的时间才找到第一份网络工程以外的工作。在那之前，我们有两位候选人进入录用阶段，却发现自己并不是&#39；我对加入我们的团队不是那么认真，一直在通过招聘渠道进行练习，并利用我们的报价作为筹码。这是一次很好的学习经历，但作为一个接受者却让人泄气。不要这样做，尤其是对时间和精力有限的小型初创公司。不管怎样，在我们建立了求职渠道，公司的形象开始增长之后，招聘变得更容易了。一旦我们雇佣了一些可靠的人，我们的集体关系网就扩大了，我们又开始得到推荐。</p><p> As the team grew, all of our processes, both internal and external, started evolving constantly. More people on the team meant we needed more efficient ways for information to travel through and out of the company. There were many knobs we experimented with: changing how teams and departments were organized, making sure all meetings had a clear purpose and were scheduled at the right cadence, making sure everybody knew which communication channel was for what (when to Slack versus email versus make a Confluence page), and tweaking how we used our task tracking tools to better align with the way we were working together. There&#39;s an art to it because changing a process causes mental friction as the team adjusts, so you find that you have to balance the necessity and frequency of changes with the severity of the communication bottleneck you are trying to address. The key is just to reflect with the team regularly (retrospectives are the perfect time for this) and build consensus on the team for small, experimental iterations. &#34;Let&#39;s try this change out for the next two weeks, and if it&#39;s not working, we&#39;ll try something else.&#34;</p><p>随着团队的成长，我们所有的内部和外部流程都开始不断发展。团队中有更多的人意味着我们需要更高效的方式让信息在公司内外传播。我们尝试了很多方法：改变团队和部门的组织方式，确保所有会议都有明确的目的，并以正确的节奏安排，确保每个人都知道哪种沟通渠道是为了什么（什么时候放松，什么时候发邮件，什么时候做合流页面），调整我们如何使用任务跟踪工具，以更好地配合我们的合作方式。那里&#39；这是一门艺术，因为改变一个过程会在团队调整时产生心理摩擦，所以你发现你必须平衡改变的必要性和频率，以及你试图解决的沟通瓶颈的严重性。关键是要定期与团队进行反思（回顾是最好的时机），并就小型实验性迭代在团队中建立共识&#34;让&#39；让我们在接下来的两周内尝试一下这个改变，如果它&#39；这不管用，我们&#39；我试试别的&#34;</p><p> We started slowly shifting from every engineer on the team knowing everything about all the code, to the minority of the team having that legacy knowledge, to nobody on the team that knew about everything. It was around this point that some engineering decisions and code from the early days started to look completely insane. This was a transcendent experience to have because these were often problems of my own making. Years ago, when considering a design tradeoff I told myself, &#34;if we get to that point, it will be a good problem to have.&#34; And sure enough, we finally got to that point!</p><p>我们开始慢慢地从团队中的每一位工程师都知道所有的代码，转变为团队中少数拥有这些遗留知识的人，转变为团队中没有人知道所有的代码。正是在这一点上，早期的一些工程决策和代码开始看起来完全疯狂。这是一次超凡的体验，因为这些问题往往是我自己造成的。几年前，在考虑设计折衷方案时，我告诉自己，&#34；如果我们做到这一点，这将是一个很好的问题&#34; 果然，我们终于做到了这一点！</p><p> It made me realize just how evolutionary the development process is. As we built, we were slowly refining our understanding of how the product delivered value to our customers. Thus, we were guaranteed to have stuff in there we didn’t need anymore because priorities shifted, or we overengineered something because we weren’t sure what direction the feature would take. We knew that we should probably back out that thing that only 0.5% of the customer base is using, or add tests and refactor that old service that&#39;s become difficult to work with, but our product team wanted us to stay focused on delivering roadmap promises. There was not enough bandwidth to perfectly execute in both directions and so you always have to work out a compromise. Don’t get frustrated by this! Remember: everybody is tugging in the direction they think is right for the company. The product team (and all departments outside of engineering really) want the same overarching thing you want in the end – happy customers and a successful outcome – so it’s important to make them aware of land mines they can’t see and at the same time listen carefully to make sure you haven’t lost sight of the larger picture. It&#39;s so much easier to build consensus when people feel heard.</p><p>这让我意识到开发过程是多么进化。随着我们的建设，我们正在慢慢完善我们对产品如何为客户带来价值的理解。因此，我们保证会有一些我们不再需要的东西，因为优先级发生了变化，或者我们过度设计了一些东西，因为我们不确定该功能会朝着什么方向发展。我们知道，我们可能应该放弃那些只有0.5%的客户群在使用的东西，或者添加测试并重构那些&#39；我们很难与之合作，但我们的产品团队希望我们专注于实现路线图承诺。没有足够的带宽在两个方向都能完美执行，所以你必须找到一个折衷方案。不要因此而沮丧！记住：每个人都在向他们认为对公司有利的方向努力。产品团队（以及工程部门以外的所有部门）最终想要的都是你想要的东西——快乐的客户和成功的结果——因此，让他们意识到他们看不到的地雷，同时仔细倾听，确保你没有忽视大局，这一点很重要。它&#39；当人们感到被倾听时，建立共识就容易多了。</p><p> At some point, I looked up and realized I was now in a “real company”. We’d raised multiple rounds of funding, there were 100+ people on the team, and we had thousands of customers. I had a weekly management meeting with other department heads where I gave an update on my team’s KPIs, and a monthly meeting with the CFO and our VP of Engineering to review the budget and hiring plan. I didn’t have as much headspace to think about code and architecture anymore because I was doing lots of one-on-ones, interviews with candidates, and meeting with the product management team to talk about shifting roadmap priorities. In other words, I had become a much smaller cog in a much more well-oiled machine, and just like everybody else in the company at this point, I wasn’t mission-critical anymore.</p><p>在某个时刻，我抬起头，意识到我现在在一家“真正的公司”。我们筹集了多轮资金，团队中有100多人，我们有数千名客户。我每周与其他部门负责人举行一次管理层会议，向他们介绍团队KPI的最新情况，每月与首席财务官和我们的工程副总裁举行一次会议，审查预算和招聘计划。我不再有那么多的空间去思考代码和架构，因为我做了很多一对一的工作，面试候选人，与产品管理团队会面，讨论改变路线图优先级。换言之，在一台运转良好的机器上，我变成了一个小得多的齿轮，就像公司里其他人一样，此时此刻，我不再是任务关键型的。</p><p> This was such a bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, it was wonderful because it meant we had been successful in building processes and a product together that could stand on their own, which was always the goal. On the other hand, I felt a sense of loss. I missed the days of hacking for 10 hours straight, when the backlog was on a whiteboard and the whole team could fit around one table. I missed personally knowing every single person in the company and recognizing the name of each company using our product. I even missed how broken and messy everything was in the early days when it seemed like a stiff gust of wind could cause an uptime alarm to go off, or you needed to truncate a misbehaving database table to prevent an in-person training session from devolving into a disaster.</p><p>这是一种苦乐参半的感觉。一方面，这很美妙，因为这意味着我们已经成功地构建了一个能够独立存在的流程和产品，这一直是我们的目标。另一方面，我感到一种失落感。我连续10个小时错过了黑客攻击的日子，那时积压的文件放在白板上，整个团队可以围坐在一张桌子上。我没有亲自认识公司里的每一个人，也没有认出使用我们产品的每一家公司的名字。我甚至错过了早期的一切是多么破碎和混乱，当时一阵风似乎会导致正常运行时间警报响起，或者你需要截断一个行为不当的数据库表，以防止亲自培训课程演变成灾难。</p><p> Early in my career, I wanted nothing more than to be part of a high-growth startup company. I used to think that in order to be successful a startup had to get the massive majority of strategic decisions correct, as if building a great company was like tiptoeing your way across a tightrope.</p><p>在我职业生涯的早期，我只想成为一家高增长初创公司的一员。我曾经认为，为了取得成功，一家初创公司必须正确地做出绝大多数战略决策，就好像建立一家伟大的公司就像踮着脚尖走过一条钢索。</p><p> Now that I’ve actually been a part of one, I’m convinced that it’s much less about getting everything right so much as it is about focusing on what you can control: patience and persistence. The journey is long and you are going to mess up a lot along the way. It’s an endless cycle of showing up every day, making mistakes, recognizing them, and then applying what you’ve learned to do better the next day. If you want to maximize your chances of success, find founders (or be a founder!) that has the humility and fortitude to commit to this endless cycle of getting incrementally better. Then, just show up every day with a smile on your face, ready to grind.
