Needless to say, it was at an  early-stage startup.</p><p>我第一次支付使用Clojure只有两年的语言发布。毋庸置疑，它是在早期的启动。</p><p> The idea behind Runa was that we’d do dynamic pricing for smaller online retailers, offering targeted discounts based on individual shopper behavior. In practice, we offered a fixed discount to anyone who abandoned their shopping cart. By treating a small percentage of customers as a control group, we could calculate our effect on the retailer’s sales, and take a cut. Our biggest problem was convincing retailers to let us control their prices, closely followed by convincing them the math behind our calculated “lift” was sound.</p><p> Runa背后的想法是我们为较小的在线零售商提供动态定价，根据个人购物者行为提供有针对性的折扣。在实践中，我们向任何抛弃购物车的人提供了固定折扣。通过将少量客户视为对照组，我们可以计算我们对零售商的销售的影响，并削减。我们最大的问题是说服零售商让我们控制他们的价格，紧随其后，说服他们计算的“升降机”背后的数学。</p><p> We told ourselves a big contract was always just about to close, permanently increasing our traffic by an order of magnitude. We used  HBase as our primary data store, because it was designed to scale, just like us.  1 In the future, we would power a loosely federated Amazon, composed of independent online retailers, knit together by our software. If we built it, they would come.</p><p> 我们告诉自己，一份大合同总是即将关闭，永久地将我们的交通量永久提高。我们使用HBase作为我们的主要数据存储，因为它旨在缩放，就像我们一样。 1在未来，我们将为一位松散的联邦亚马逊供电，由独立在线零售商组成，由我们的软件编织在一起。如果我们建造它，他们会来。</p><p> But they didn’t. The only thing that kept us afloat was a bespoke product we had built for eBay, because our CEO knew an executive there. Later, after I left, that same executive moved to Staples and convinced them to acquire the startup outright. Nothing we had built was useful to Staples, it was just evidence of our ability to “innovate”. The resulting  “skunk works” team has since been disbanded.</p><p> 但他们没有。让我们漂浮的唯一一件事是我们为eBay建造的定制产品，因为我们的首席执行官知道那里的执行官。后来，在我离开之后，同一行政行政转移到Staples，并说服他们彻底获取初创公司。我们建造的没有什么对钉书钉有用，这只是我们“创新”的能力的证据。由此产生的“Skunk Works”团队已被解散。</p><p> My next job was at  Factual, a more established startup that had built their product using Java and  embedded Javascript, and were beginning to adopt Clojure. Their product was an index of all the places in the world, generated by applying hundreds of different heuristics to web crawl data. Each entry had a canonical id and various properties like name, address, and hours. More interestingly, it also had the equivalent ids from different platforms like Yelp and Foursquare, and we offered an API that could resolve an an incomplete (or even partially incorrect) set of properties to the corresponding entity in our index.</p><p> 我的下一份工作是事实上，一个更建立的创业公司使用Java和嵌入式JavaScript建立了他们的产品，并开始采用Clojure。他们的产品是世界上所有地方的指数，通过将数百种不同的启发式应用于Web爬网数据而产生。每个条目都有一个规范ID和各种属性，如名称，地址和小时。更有趣的是，它还具有来自不同平台的等效ID，如yelp和foursquare，我们提供了一个API，它可以解决一个不完整的（或甚至部分不正确）属性集到我们的索引中的相应实体。</p><p> Our product could stitch together thousands of disparate datasets, so long as they had some geographic component; I liked to describe it as a “foreign key for the world”. Unfortunately, there’s not much money in ontologies. By the time I had joined, the dataset had already been used as the basis for  Facebook Places and as part of Apple’s then-new map offering. These were large contracts, but there are only so many big tech firms in the world, and even fewer with a geographic component to their data. No matter how much we tried to make up the difference with our smaller customers, we didn’t have a path to a billion dollar valuation.</p><p> 我们的产品可以缝合成千上万的不同数据集，只要他们有一些地理成分;我喜欢将其描述为“世界外钥匙”。不幸的是，在本体中没有多少钱。当我加入时，数据集已被用作Facebook地点的基础，作为Apple的新地图产品的一部分。这些是大合同，但世界上只有这么多的大型技术公司，甚至更少地与他们的数据进行地理组件。无论我们试图弥补与我们较小的客户的差异，我们没有估价十亿美元的途径。</p><p> We began to offer services powered by our data. Internally, this was presented as less a pivot than a demonstration of the intrinsic value of our data; once people saw what  we could do with our data, surely they’d have some ideas of their own. Our first customers were adtech firms, hoping to do better geographic targeting for mobile ads. We hired salespeople and marketing executives with a background in digital advertising, and when sales started to take off we hired more. Even as I built  services to ingest billions of daily ad impressions and bespoke  almost-databases to power on-premise services for our adtech partners, I told myself it was all incidental; our business was data, not ads.</p><p> 我们开始提供由我们的数据提供支持的服务。在内部，这呈现为缺点，而不是证明我们数据内在价值的枢轴;一旦人们看到我们可以用数据做些什么，他们肯定会有自己的一些想法。我们的第一个客户是Adtech公司，希望为移动广告做更好的地理目标。我们在数字广告的背景下聘请了销售人员和营销高管，当销售开始脱掉我们雇用更多。即使我建立了为您的数十亿日广告印象和定制的近似数据库为我们的Adtech Partners提供了电源的服务，我告诉自己所有偶然;我们的业务是数据，而不是广告。 </p><p> I was wrong, of course. The advertising side of the company was where all the growth was happening, and our product direction was whatever helped them close deals. But I wasn’t the only person who was slow to acknowledge this fact. In my exit interview with the CEO, just after I had given notice, I told him that he should be more direct with everyone that Factual’s focus had permanently shifted. He told me what I had only just stopped telling myself: ads were a temporary diversion, and we’d return to the underlying data before too long. In the years that followed, however, Factual became increasingly focused on location-based advertising, until it finally  merged with Foursquare.</p><p>当然，我错了。该公司的广告方面是所有增长发生的地方，我们的产品方向是帮助他们接近交易的任何东西。但我不是唯一一个缓慢的人，以承认这一事实。在我的退出采访中，在我发出通知之后，我告诉他，他应该更直接地与每个人的重点永久转移。他告诉我，我刚刚停止告诉自己：广告是一个临时转移，我们将在太长时间恢复到底层数据。然而，在遵循的几年里，事实上变得越来越关注基于位置的广告，直到它最终与Foursquare合并。</p><p>  When a startup takes venture funding, its singular goal becomes growth; it will either reach a billion dollar valuation or die trying. With that growth comes ever-greater technical challenges. Some of these are obvious: more users will not only require more machines, but a more complex infrastructure.  2 Others are less obvious: as the userbase grows, each individual becomes increasingly abstracted in the business logic of our software. To deal with the first challenge, we must have technical acumen. To deal with the second, we must have a deep understanding of our business domain.</p><p>  当一个创业者拿起风险投资时，其奇异的目标变得增长;它将达到十亿美元的估值或死亡。随着这种增长，具有更大的技术挑战。其中一些是显而易见的：更多的用户不仅需要更多的机器，而且需要更复杂的基础设施。 2其他不太明显：随着UserBase的增长，每个人都在我们软件的业务逻辑中越来越多地抽象。要处理第一个挑战，我们必须具有技术敏锐。要处理第二个，我们必须深入了解我们的业务领域。</p><p> This means that as long as a startup continues to grow, its engineers can (and must) continue to improve their knowledge and acumen. But most startups fail. Some of those failures are because the company  couldn’t keep up with their own growth, but these are the exception. The common, boring reason for failure is that the startup barely grew at all.</p><p> 这意味着只要初创公司继续增长，它的工程师就可以（并且必须）继续改善他们的知识和敏锐。但大多数初创公司失败了。其中一些失败是因为公司无法跟上自己的增长，但这些都是例外。常见的，无聊的失败原因是启动根本不断增长。</p><p> Confronted with stagnation, an engineering organization can have two reactions: they can try to help reinvent the company, or they can continue to prepare for the growth that must, inevitably, come. At Runa, we chose the latter.</p><p> 对抗停滞不前，工程组织可以有两个反应：他们可以试图帮助重塑公司，或者他们可以继续为必须，不可避免的增长做好准备。在Runa，我们选择了后者。</p><p> At first, the engineering leadership adopted promising, poorly-understood technologies (Clojure! HBase!) which would give them the necessary leverage down the line. But once they launched, and the stagnation set in, that preparation became a need for constant readiness. Any early technical mistakes, however regrettable, were baked in. Trying to revisit them, to build something better, would just leave us flat-footed when the growth finally came.</p><p> 起初，工程领导层采用了有希望的，理解的技术（Clojure！HBase！），这将使他们下行必要的杠杆。但是一旦他们发起，并且停滞不前，那么准备就是需要不断准备。然而，任何早期的技术错误都令人遗憾的是，被烘焙了。试图重新审视他们，建立更好的东西，当增长终于来了，我们会挡住我们平脚。</p><p> I joined Runa only a few months before the engineering organization entered its defensive crouch. I was too inexperienced and too distracted  3 to question it. Every day we played Jenga, trying to jostle the existing codebase as little as possible with each new commit. Later, as I realized I wasn’t proud of any of the work I had done so far, I began to energetically push for rebuilding key pieces of the system.</p><p> 我在工程机构进入其防守蹲伏之前几个月加入了Runa。我太过于经验，太分散了3个问题。每天我们都玩jenga，尝试尽可能少地追逐现有的代码库。后来，当我意识到我到目前为止的任何工作都不为我所做的任何工作都不自豪，我开始强大地推动重建系统的关键作品。</p><p> After a few months, I was told to either drop it or take three weeks severance. I took the severance.</p><p> 几个月后，我被告知要丢弃它或留下三周的遣散费。我接受了遣散费。 </p><p> Of course, even if I had gotten my way, nothing would have changed. All of us were carefully ignoring the actual problem, which is that our business model didn’t really work. Our product and pricing model both required unjustifiable levels of trust from our prospective customers, but none of us saw that as our problem to solve. We were downstream of the business model; our job was simply to wait and prepare for its eventual success.</p><p>当然，即使我已经得到了我的方式，也没有任何改变。我们所有人都仔细忽略了实际问题，这就是我们的商业模式并没有真正工作。我们的产品和定价模型都需要我们未来的客户所需的无疑，但我们都没有看到这是我们解决的问题。我们在商业模式下游;我们的工作只是等待和准备最终的成功。</p><p> I joined Factual because I found the problem space fascinating, but most of it had been solved by the time I joined. About six months later, the leadership began to acknowledge that our business model, while successful, wasn’t going to get us to a billion dollar valuation. So began my descent into adtech.</p><p> 我加入了事实，因为我发现问题空间令人着迷，但它的大部分都已解决了我加入的时间。大约六个月后，领导力开始承认我们的商业模式，同时成功，不会让我们估值十亿美元。所以开始我的血统。</p><p> I wanted to prove that I had learned my lesson; if the current business model wasn’t working, I’d help them build a new one. I built services to consume the raw data, and on-premise servers to provide the processed result to our customers. I attended sales meetings, wrote design docs, and painstakingly analyzed packet dumps to prove to partners that latency spikes were occurring elsewhere in their system.</p><p> 我想证明我已经了解了我的课程;如果目前的商业模式不起作用，我会帮助他们建立一个新的。我建立了消耗原始数据的服务，以及为客户提供处理结果的服务器。我参加了销售会议，写了设计文档，并煞费苦地分析了分析的包垃圾，以证明延迟尖峰在其系统中其他地方发生的合作伙伴。</p><p> In the end, I learned that I didn’t like the advertising industry very much. When a brand wanted to run a digital ad campaign, they went to an agency, which is be responsible for spending their budget to the greatest effect. The agency then went to a demand-side platform (DSP), which was be responsible for making real-time bids on individual ad impressions on an exchange. To inform those decisions, the DSP went to a company like Factual, which could distill a phone’s current and past locations into binary features relevant to the campaign.</p><p> 最后，我了解到我不喜欢广告业。当一个品牌想要经营一个数字广告活动时，他们就前往一个机构，这是负责将他们的预算支出最大的效果。该机构然后去了一个需求侧平台（DSP），该平台（DSP）负责对交易所的个人广告印象进行实时出价。要告知这些决策，DSP将像事实一样的公司进入公司，这可以将手机的当前和过去的位置蒸馏出与广告系列相关的二元特征。</p><p> Crucially, when you’re not selling something online, it’s almost impossible to measure the efficacy of a digital ad campaign.  This means that the agency could say almost anything, so long as it closed the deal. The DSP, in turn, sold whatever they thought would help agencies close their deals. And at the end of this chain was Factual, selling whatever we thought would entice the salespeople enticing the salespeople enticing the brands.</p><p> 至关重要的是，当您没有在线销售某些东西时，几乎不可能衡量数字广告活动的效果。这意味着该机构几乎可以说，只要它关闭交易即可。反过来，DSP又出售了他们认为有助于机构的交易。在这个链条的尽头是事实上，销售我们认为的任何东西都会吸引销售人员诱人的销售人员。</p><p> I thought I had become product-focused, ready to solve any problem that would help the company to succeed. In truth, I was only really paying attention to the technical problems. Once they were largely solved, it became harder to ignore my ambivalence for what the product actually did. Eventually, I left.</p><p> 我以为我已经成为产品专注，准备解决任何有助于公司成功的问题。事实上，我只是真正关注技术问题。一旦他们在很大程度上得到解决，它就会变得越难以忽视我的矛盾，因为产品实际上是什么。最终，我离开了。</p><p>  I learned two lessons from this time in my life. The first was personal: I am, at heart, a technologist. I like to generalize, to abstract. While I believe it’s crucial to understand the context around your software, I’m happiest when that context is other people’s software.</p><p>  我从这个时候学到了两节课。第一个是个人的：我是，在内心，技术人员。我喜欢概括，摘要。虽然我相信了解软件周围的背景是至关重要的，但是当上下文是其他人的软件时，我最开心。 </p><p> The second lesson was broader, and less obvious:  our industry is designed to foster people like me.</p><p>第二课更广泛，而且不太明显：我们的行业旨在培养像我这样的人。</p><p> This was surprising because it seems so clearly against our own interest. In almost every case, companies fail because they build the wrong thing. Unless your customers are themselves engineers, I’m the wrong person to help with that. You want someone comfortable at the periphery of your system, who wants to learn about the competitive landscape, who wants to talk to customers. You want a product engineer.</p><p> 这令人惊讶，因为它似乎很清楚地反对我们自己的兴趣。在几乎每种情况下，公司都失败了，因为他们建立了错误的东西。除非您的客户自己是工程师，否则我是错误的人的帮助。您希望有人在系统的周边舒适，他们希望了解竞争景观，愿意与客户交谈。您想要产品工程师。</p><p> But consider our standard interview questions: data structures, recursion, and computational complexity. It always feels a little strange when I see someone arguing that these don’t reflect “real” day-to-day software tasks; I write recursive functions all the time. But that’s a consequence of the abstraction; what might be a simple nested lookup on any specific datatype becomes recursion when you try to generalize over a set of possible datatypes.</p><p> 但考虑我们的标准面试问题：数据结构，递归和计算复杂性。当我看到有人认为这些不反映“真实”的日常软件任务时，它总是感到有点奇怪;我一直在写递归函数。但这是抽象的结果;当您尝试通过一组可能的数据类型概括时，任何特定数据类型都可能是一个简单的嵌套查找变为递归。</p><p> Likewise, I’ve seen it argued that the difference between, say,  O(log N) and  O(N) isn’t important, because in practice  N tends to be small enough. That may be true for some domains, maybe even most of them, but if you’re building a general-purpose tool you have to focus on the pathological cases.</p><p> 同样，我已经看到它认为，说，O（log n）和o（n）之间的区别并不重要，因为实际上n往往足够小。对于某些域来说，这可能是真的，甚至可能是大多数域，但如果您正在构建一个通用工具，您必须专注于病理案件。</p><p> Of course, others will argue this first-year CS material is the essence of what we do. This was certainly the attitude when I was at Google;  6 since their existing employees were  going to any length to avoid writing Javascript, they decided that anyone with frontend experience would be held to a lower technical standard. These hires were widely viewed as second-class; people who were only allowed in because they were willing to do the work no one else wanted.</p><p> 当然，其他人将争论这一年度CS材料是我们所做的本质。这肯定是我在谷歌时的态度; 6由于他们现有的员工将避免编写JavaScript的任何长度，他们决定将有前部经验的人持有较低的技术标准。这些雇员被广泛被视为二等级;只允许的人因为他们愿意做其他人想要的工作。</p><p> But if we want to hire product engineers, what questions should we ask instead? It’s impractical, given the sprawling scope of our industry, to only consider candidates with prior experience in our exact product space. Likewise, it’s unrealistic to expect that we’d have expertise in a candidate’s prior product spaces. We lack a common vocabulary, a common understanding of the nuances that separate good design choices from middling ones.</p><p> 但如果我们想聘请产品工程师，那么我们应该问哪些问题？考虑到我们行业的范围，鉴于我们的精确产品空间，只考虑候选人是不切实际的。同样，期望我们在候选人的先前产品空间中拥有专业知识是不现实的。我们缺乏共同的词汇，对差别的差别很常见，从中间林分开良好的设计选择。</p><p> And so we continue to  search for our keys under the streetlamp; they could be anywhere, but this is where the light is. If we’re lucky, the technologists we hire will also have all the other skills necessary to make humane, useful software.</p><p> 因此，我们继续搜索街灯下的钥匙;他们可以在任何地方，但这就是光线的地方。如果我们幸运，我们雇用的技术人员也将拥有使人性化，有用的软件所需的所有其他技能。 </p><p> This means that even if you’re not a technologist, you have to learn how to pretend.  7 And this brings us back to the beginning, when it was obvious that my first Clojure job, only two years after the language was released, would have been at an early-stage startup.</p><p>这意味着即使您不是技术人员，您也必须学习如何假装。 7，这让我们回到了开始，当我的第一个Clojure工作很明显，只有两年的语言被释放，就会在早期启动。</p><p> Most new technologies, if they get adopted at all, follow a familiar path: first come the hobbyists, and then the companies which employ those hobbyists. This second step is easiest when the company has little to no process around adopting a new technology; in other words, an early-stage startup. The  standard narrative around this phenomenon is that certain technologies are simply more powerful, but only startups are daring enough to hire from the niche pool of talent that knows how to wield them.</p><p> 大多数新技术，如果他们完全被采用，请遵循熟悉的道路：首先来到业余爱好者，然后雇用那些业余爱者的公司。当公司几乎没有进程采用新技术时，第二步是最简单的;换句话说，早期启动。这种现象周围的标准叙述是某些技术简单地更加强大，但只有初创公司才能达到足够的才能雇用知道如何挥动它们的人才池。</p><p> But new technologies  8 don’t have power; for that they’d need a community, documentation, and a thriving ecosystem of ancillary technology. What they have is  potential, which resonates with the potential within the startup and the early adopter; perhaps they can all, over time, grow together.</p><p> 但新技术8没有权力;为此，他们需要一个社区，文件和繁荣的辅助技术生态系统。他们有什么是潜在的，这在启动中的潜力和早期采用者共鸣;或许他们可以随着时间的推移，一起成长。</p><p> As many have pointed out, this is not a rational strategy for building a company. It is, however, a phenomenal way to train new technologists.  Chesterton notwithstanding, the fastest way to learn why a fence exists is to tear it down and see what happens.</p><p> 正如许多人所说，这不是建立公司的理性战略。然而，培训新技术人员是一种现象的方式。叶鹿尽管是最快的方式来学习为什么围栏存在的是将它撕下并看看会发生什么。</p><p> Seen from this perspective, it doesn’t seem so irrational; most startups fail before reaching a scale that has any existential technical risks. The only guaranteed benefit they can offer their engineers is the freedom to invent their own challenges, and learn through iterative failure.  9 If the startup fails, there’s no harm done. If the startup gets traction, the engineers can apply their newfound wisdom.</p><p> 从这个角度看，似乎不合理;在达到具有任何存在的技术风险的规模之前，大多数初始启动失败。他们可以提供其工程师的唯一保证福利是发明自己挑战的自由，并通过迭代失败来学习。 9如果启动失败，则没有损害。如果启动获取牵引力，工程师可以应用他们的新发现智慧。</p><p> This means startups don’t adopt new technologies despite their immaturity, they adopt them  because of that immaturity. This drives a constant churn of novelty and obsolescence, which amplifies the importance of a technologist’s skillset, which drives startups to adopt new technologies.</p><p> 这意味着初创公司尽管他们不成熟，但由于这种不成熟，他们不采用新技术。这推动了不断流失的新奇和过时，这可以放大技术专家技能集的重要性，这使得启动是采用新技术的启动。</p><p> This flywheel has been spinning for a long time, and won’t stop simply because I’ve pointed out that we’re conflating novelty with technological advancement. Hopefully we can slow it down, though, because I believe it’s causing real harm.</p><p> 这款飞轮一直在旋转很长一段时间，并不会仅仅因为我指出，我们指出我们与技术进步的新颖性。希望我们能够减慢它，因为我相信它导致真正的伤害。 </p><p> By introducing abstraction into every problem we solve, we distance ourselves from how our work is ultimately used. We tell ourselves we’re in the business of building sharp knives; if we made them safer, they’d be useless for everything except spreading butter. We float above the the effects of what we’ve created, treating them as inexorable consequences of  progress.</p><p>通过将抽象引入我们解决的每个问题，我们将自己与我们的工作最终如何偏信。我们告诉自己，我们正在建设锋利的刀具;如果我们让他们更安全，他们就会对除了传播黄油以外的一切。我们浮动到我们创造的内容的影响，将它们视为进展的不可原谅的后果。</p><p> It’s true we can’t encode our values into general-purpose software,  10 but we’re not simply atomized technologists, and our worlds are not bounded by the interfaces we expose. We share a collective responsibility for what we create, and are capable of collectively acting on that responsibility.</p><p> 这是真的，我们无法将我们的价值编码为通用软件，但我们不仅仅是雾化技术人员，我们的世界并不受到我们曝光的界面的限制。我们为我们创造的集体分享了一个集体责任，并能够集体起到这一责任。</p><p> But what does a belief in collective responsibility mean, in practical terms? What actions does it entail? Honestly, I don’t know. All I know is that we can’t stay under the streetlamp forever. At some point, we’ll have to see what’s out there in the dark.</p><p> 但是，在实际术语中，集体责任的信念是什么意思？它需要什么行动？老实说，我不知道。我所知道的就是我们不能永远留在街灯下面。在某些时候，我们必须在黑暗中看到那里的东西。</p><p>  In a twist that will surprise no one, the way we used it could never scale. To support linear scans over the key space, HBase partitions on contiguous ranges in the keyspace. Since we wanted to scan over the events for a given day, all of our keys began with a timestamp. This meant every write for a given time period was focused on a single shard, which would drive HBase to constantly repartition its shards in a futile attempt to equally distribute the load. Our HBase cluster was always on the cusp of falling over.  ↩</p><p>  在一个人的扭曲中，没有人惊喜，我们使用它的方式永远不会缩放。支持在关键空间上的线性扫描，在键盘中的连续范围内的HBase分区。由于我们想扫描给定日期的事件，因此我们所有的密钥都开始使用时间戳。这意味着每个写入时间段都专注于单个碎片，这会驱动HBase以在徒劳的尝试中不断重新分配其碎片，以便同样地分配负荷。我们的HBase集群始终在跌倒的尖端上。 ↩</p><p>  Even in the exceedingly rare case where your core services can horizontally scale, processing the increasing volumes of data they generate will introduce complexity elsewhere in your system.  ↩</p><p>  即使在您的核心服务可以水平划分的非常罕见的情况下，处理他们生成的增加的数据量将在您的系统其他地方引入复杂性。 ↩</p><p>  My first year at Runa coincided with a bout of mostly-unrelated depression, and the one-foot-in-front-of-the-other approach to software development perfectly mirrored how I was approaching pretty much everything else in my life.  ↩</p><p>  我的第一年符合突破大多数不相关的抑郁症，以及软件开发的一步前方的途径完全反映了我生命中的其他一切。 ↩</p><p>      This was back in 2010, but I’d be surprised if anything has substantially changed.  ↩</p><p>      这是2010年的回归，但如果任何事情都大幅改变，我会感到惊讶。 ↩ </p><p>  I know of a few ways to skip this gauntlet, but none of them have universal appeal. If someone at an early-stage startup vouches for you, they’ll often skip straight to making sure you’re a “culture fit”. This only works, however, for a candidate with a strong network, who wants to work for a small startup, and who fits the culture in question. Likewise, you can simply found your own company, but being a founder places you first and foremost at the interface between business and investor; the interface between product and user is always further down the list.  ↩</p><p>我知道几种方法来跳过这个手套，但他们都没有普遍上诉。如果有人在一个早期的启动凭借你的奉献，他们往往会跳过直接，以确保你是“文化合适”。然而，这仅适用于拥有强大网络的候选人，他们想要为一个小型启动工作，谁适合有问题的文化。同样，您可以简单地找到自己的公司，但作为创始人首先在商业和投资者之间的界面中首先让您首先放置产品和用户之间的接口始终在列表中进一步。 ↩</p><p>  And the niche technologies adopted by startups are, almost without exception, new. Graham’s Lisp evangelism didn’t lead to widespread adoption of Common Lisp, it led to the adoption of Clojure, a brand new Lisp which was still full of potential.  ↩</p><p>  初创公司采用的利基技术几乎没有例外，新的。格雷厄姆的丽水福音派没有导致普遍采用普通的丽斯普斯，它导致了克洛康的采用，这是一个仍然充满潜力的全新的Lisp。 ↩</p><p>  Given our current situation, telling junior engineers to only use boring technologies can actually be portrayed as the older generations of engineers pulling up the ladder.
