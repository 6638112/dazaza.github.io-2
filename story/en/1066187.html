Lynch has seen Apple Watch grow considerably during his time at the company, but he’s also been integral to the evolution of the its health initiatives. He explained how it became what it is today and provided some hints as to where it might go in the future.</p><p>我与Apple Technology Kevin Lynch副总裁谈到凯文林奇，他在2014年9月的考试事件2014年9月期间首次在世界阶段展示了Apple手表。 Lynch已经看到Apple Watch在该公司的时间期间增长了很大的增长，但他对其健康倡议的演变也是一体化的。他解释了它是如何成为今天的东西，并为未来的地方提供了一些提示。</p><p> “It’s been amazing how much it’s evolved over time,” Lynch said, referring to the original Health app. “It actually started from Apple Watch, where we were capturing heart rate data for calorimetry activity, and [Activity] ring closure, and we needed a place to put the heart rate data. So we created the Health app as a place to store the data.”</p><p> “随着时间的推移，它一直很棒，这是指原始的健康应用程序。 “它实际上从Apple Watch开始，在那里我们正在捕获热量测定活动的心率数据，以及[活动]圈关闭，我们需要一个放置心率数据的地方。所以我们创建了健康应用程序作为存储数据的地方。“</p><p>   From there, Lynch says Apple realized that once you had this centralized location, they could develop a system that could store other data types, as well, and create an API and architecture that allowed developers to store related data there, as well, in a privacy-respecting way. In the early days, the Health app was still essentially a passive storehouse, providing users one touchpoint for various health-related information, but the company soon began thinking more about what else it could offer, and inspiration came from users.</p><p>   从那里，Lynch说Apple意识到一旦你有这个集中的位置，他们就可以开发一个可以存储其他数据类型的系统，也可以创建一个API和架构，允许开发人员存储相关数据，也可以在其中存储相关数据隐私尊重方式。在早期，健康应用程序仍然是一个被动仓库，为用户提供各种与健康相关信息的一个接触点，但该公司很快就开始了更多关于它可以提供的东西，而且来自用户的灵感来自用户。</p><p>  A key turning point for Apple’s approach to health came when the company saw that users were doing more with features available via the Apple Watch than the company ever intended, Lynch said.</p><p>  当公司看到用户通过Apple Watch提供更多的功能时，苹果公司健康方法的一个关键转折点来自苹果手表的功能比有史以来有目的的产品。</p><p> “We were showing people their heart rate, and you could look at it — we were using it for calorimetry,” he told me. “But some users actually were looking at their heart rate when they weren’t working out, and noticed it was high. […]They would go talk to their doctor, and the doctor would find a heart issue, and we would start getting letters about this. We still get letters today about our work in the space, which is amazing. But some of those early letters were clueing us into ‘Wait, we could actually look for that ourselves in the background.”</p><p> “我们向人们展示了他们的心率，你可以看看它 - 我们正在使用它来热量测量法，”他告诉我。 “但是当他们没有锻炼时，一些用户实际上正在看他们的心率，并注意到它很高。 [...]他们会和他们的医生一起谈谈，医生会发现一个心脏问题，我们将开始发言。我们今天仍然会收到关于我们在空间的工作，这是惊人的。但其中一些早期的信件是把我们送入'等等，我们实际上可以在背景中寻找自己。“</p><p> Apple then developed its high heart rate alert notifications, which can tell users when Apple Watch detects an unusually high heart rate that occurs when they aren’t moving around very much. High resting heart rates are good indicators of potential issues, and Apple also later added notifications for unusually low heart rates. This was all data that was already available to the user, but Apple saw that it could proactively provide it to users, providing the benefits already enjoyed by the most vigilant of all Apple Watch owners.</p><p> 然后，Apple开发了它的高度心率警报通知，可以告诉用户，当Apple Watch发现当他们没有非常移动时发生异常高的心率。高休息心率是潜在问题的良好指标，苹果还为异常低的心率增加了通知。这是用户已经可用的数据，但Apple看到它可以主动向用户提供，提供所有Apple Watch所有者最警惕的福利。</p><p>  From there, Apple started investing more heavily in thinking about more areas where it could glean similar insights. Rather than waiting for user behavior to identify new areas to explore (though Lynch says that’s still important to the team), the company started hiring more clinicians and medical researchers to chart the path forward for Health.</p><p>  从那里开始，Apple开始在思考更多领域，在那里它可以收集类似的见解。而不是等待用户行为来识别要探索的新领域（虽然Lynch说这对团队仍然很重要），但该公司开始招聘更多临床医生和医学研究人员来绘制前进的道路。 </p><p> One example of where that led was announced at WWDC: Walking steadiness, a new metric that provides a simple score of how stable a Watch wearer’s average gait is.</p><p>其中LED在WWDC宣布的位置的一个例子：行走稳定性，这是一种新的公制，提供了一个简单的分数，表明佩戴者平均步态的稳定性。</p><p> “Walking steadiness […] actually came from fall detection,” Lynch said. We were working on fall detection, and and that’s been really awesome, but as we’re working on it, we’re brainstorming about how we can actually help people not fall, rather than just detecting that they fell. It’s pretty tricky to do that in the moment — there’s not much you could do once that’s actually happening.”</p><p> “散步稳定[...]实际上来自跌倒检测，”林奇说。我们正在努力检测，而且真的很棒，但正如我们正在努力的那样，我们对我们的头脑风暴我们如何实际帮助人们不会堕落，而不是只是检测他们跌倒。在此时这样做是非常棘手的 - 你可能会做一次实际发生的事情。“</p><p> Lynch is referring to the fall detection feature that Apple introduced in 2018, which could use motion sensor data to detect what was likely a sudden and severe fall, and provide emergency alerts to hopefully render aid to the wearer who had fallen. Apple was able to look at fall detection data for users in its 100,000-participant strong  Heart and Movement study and combine that with data gathered from the iPhone in the same study about walking metrics.</p><p> Lynch指的是苹果在2018年推出的秋季检测特征，它可以使用运动传感器数据来检测可能突然和严重的跌倒，并提供紧急警报，希望能够向堕落的佩戴者提供援助。 Apple能够在其10,000名参与者强大的心脏和运动研究中查看用户的堕落检测数据，并将其与iPhone收集的数据相结合在同一关于步行指标的研究中。</p><p> “[The Heart and Movement study data] has been super helpful in some of the work here on machine learning,” Lynch said. “And then we did a focus study of particularly around falls with walking steadiness, where we used [as] the source of truth a set of traditional measurements of walking steadiness; so questionnaires, clinical observation, people meeting with doctors and they’re observing the person walking. And then as over the period of a year or two, as people in that study happened to fall, we were able to look at all their metrics ahead of that and understand, ‘What are the real predictors here of potential fall?’ Then we were able to build a model around that.”</p><p> “[心脏和运动研究数据]在机器学习的一些工作中一直非常有用，”林奇说。 “然后我们做了一个焦点研究，特别是在散步的堕落中，我们使用的是，真理的来源是一套散步的传统测量;所以问卷调查，临床观察，人们与医生开会，他们正在观察走路。然后在一两年或两年的时间内，随着那个研究的人发生堕落，我们能够在此之前看待他们的所有指标并理解，“潜在的堕落中的真正预测变量是什么？”然后我们能够建立一个模特。“</p><p>  Apple actually accomplished something with its Walking Steadiness feature that is very rare in the health and fitness industry: It created a clinically validated, meaningful new metric around individual health. The Health app assigns a score from Very Low to Low or OK, based on motion-sensing data passively gathered through Apple’s iPhone sensors (the phone is better able to detect these metrics since it’s positioned on your hip, Lynch says). Perhaps best of all, according to Lynch, the data is actually something people can use to make real improvements.</p><p>  Apple实际上已经完成了散步稳定功能，在健康和健身行业中非常罕见：它在个人健康方面创造了一个临床验证，有意义的新公制。卫生应用程序根据通过Apple的iPhone传感器被动地收集的运动传感数据分配得分从非常低到低电平或确定（手机更能够检测到这些指标，因为它位于臀部，Lynch说）。也许最好的，根据林奇的说法，数据实际上是人们可以用来做出真正的改进。</p><p> “The other compelling thing is that it’s actionable,” he said. “Some of these things can be harder to change. But with walking steadiness, there are exercises you can do to improve your walking steadiness. And so we built those into the Health app. You can watch the videos and do the exercises and work to improve your steadiness ahead of falling.”</p><p> “另一个引人注目的事情是它是可行的，”他说。 “其中一些事情可能更难以改变。但随着行走的稳定，有练习可以做到提高你的行走稳定性。所以我们建造了那些进入健康应用程序的人。您可以观看视频，并进行练习和工作，以提高您的稳定性。“</p><p> Walking steadiness is perhaps the best expression yet of an area of increased focus for Apple when it comes to health: Turning the devices you carry with you into an ambient protector of sorts.</p><p> 步行稳定性可能是一个最佳表达，尚未在苹果的焦点增加的情况下，在健康方面：转动你随身携带的设备进入各种环境保护者。 </p><p>  Apple’s Health app provides a good overview of the metrics that you might want to keep track of, and the company has steadily built out a library of vetted contextual information to make it easier to understand what you’re seeing (including through new updated lab displays that translate results into plain language in iOS 15). But one of the areas where it’s in a unique position to innovate is in proactive or preventative health. Lynch pointed out that the walking steadiness feature is a progression of those efforts.</p><p>Apple的Health App提供了您可能希望跟踪的指标概述，并且公司稳步建立了审计的上下文信息库，以便更容易理解您所看到的内容（包括通过新的更新的实验室显示将结果转化为iOS 15中的纯语言）。但是它在一个独特的创新位置的领域是主动或预防性健康。林奇指出，行走稳定性特征是这些努力的进展。</p><p> “The walking steadiness work is in this category that we think of as ‘Intelligent Guardian’; it’s ‘How can we help watch out for people with data that they may not otherwise be even looking at or aware of, and let them know of potential changes,” he said.</p><p> “走路稳定工作在这个类别中，我们认为是”智能卫报“;这是'我们如何帮助甚至甚至可以看待他们的数据，以其他方式甚至看出或意识到，让他们知道潜在的变化，“他说。</p><p> Lynch admits that the ‘Intelligent Guardian’ category wasn’t something that was initially really part of the plan for Apple Watch and health.</p><p> 林奇承认，“智能监护人”类别不是苹果手表和健康计划的最初真正的一部分。</p><p> In the early days, we weren’t as onto this line of thinking about ‘Intelligent Guardian, as we are now,” he said. “Those early letters were really inspiring in terms of [pointing out] we could actually let people know these things that are really meaningful.”</p><p> 在初期，我们并没有就像我们现在一样的思考“智能卫士”，“他说。” “那些早期的信件就是在[指出]方面真正鼓舞人心，我们实际上可以让人们知道这些真正有意义的事情。”</p><p>  Those letters still inspire the team working on health features and help motivate the team and validate their work. Lynch cites one Apple received where a person had purchased an Apple Watch for their father, and while his father was out biking he got thrown off the bike and fell into a gully. Apple Watch detected the fall, and also that he was unconscious, and the Watch was luckily set up to notify emergency contacts and 911, and did both. It provided the son with a location on a map, so his son rushed to the spot, but found paramedics on scene already loading his father (who ended up being okay) into an ambulance.</p><p>  这些信件仍然激发了在健康特征上工作的团队，并帮助激励团队并验证他们的工作。 Lynch Cites将一个人收到一个人为他们父亲购买了一个苹果手表的苹果，而他的父亲出去骑自行车，他被扔掉了自行车，落入了一个沟壑。苹果手表检测到秋天，而且他也是无意识的，幸运的是，幸运地建立了通知紧急联系和911，并做了两者。它为儿子在地图上提供了一个位置，所以他的儿子赶到了现场，但发现了现场的护理人员已经装载了他的父亲（最终结束了）进入救护车。</p><p> “Now, there’s a lot of thought that we put into ‘What are the other things that we could maybe sense about someone and let them know about?&#39;” he said. “Our work on health very much involves this ongoing discussion of, from a clinical perspective, what is really interesting to know about somebody? Then from a science perspective, what do we think that we can sense about somebody? It’s this intersection of what might we be able to know and extract from the data that we gather, or are their new sensors that we might be able to build to get some data that could answer the questions that, clinically, we think would be really valid.”</p><p> “现在，有很多想法我们投入'我们可能意识到某人的其他事情是什么，让他们了解？＆＃39;”他说。 “我们对健康的工作非常涉及这种正在进行的讨论，从临床的角度来看，了解某人真正有趣的是什么？然后从科学的角度来看，我们认为我们可以对某人感到意识到？这是我们可以从我们收集的数据中了解和提取的内容，或者是他们可以建立的新传感器，以获得一些可以回答的数据，临床上，我们认为真的有效的。”</p><p>  Another big change coming in iOS 15 for Apple Health is sharing. Apple will allow private, secure sharing of health data from users to loved ones and caregivers, including doctors. Users can choose exactly what health data to share, and can revoke access at any time. Apple itself never sees that data, and it’s encrypted locally on your device and then decrypted in local memory on the receiving device.</p><p>  Apple Health IOS 15的另一个大变化是分享。 Apple将允许私人，确保用户从用户提供健康数据，以便包括医生在内的亲人和照顾者。用户可以确切地选择要共享的健康数据，并且可以随时撤销访问权限。 Apple本身从未看到该数据，它在设备上本地加密，然后在接收设备上的本地存储器中解密。 </p><p>  Health sharing is a natural extension of Apple’s work with the ‘Intelligent Guardian’ since it elevates personal health care into what it always has been — something managed by a network of connected individuals — but augmented by modern technology and sensing capabilities.</p><p>卫生分享是苹果公司与“智能卫报”合作的自然延伸，因为它将个人保健升级到它始终的东西 - 由连通人网络管理的东西 - 但是由现代技术和传感能力增强。</p><p> “The other person you’re watching out for can see that information, and be notified of changes, and you can see a little dashboard of the data,” Lynch said. “That’s going to be super helpful, we hope, for people, especially as you’re caring for an older adult, or caring for a partner of yours — that’s going to basically enable people to do that kind of mutual support on their health journey.”</p><p> “你正在观看的另一个人可以看到这个信息，并被通知更改，你可以看到数据的小仪表板，”林奇说。 “这将是超级乐于助人的，我们希望人们希望，特别是因为你在照顾老年人，或照顾你的伴侣 - 这将基本上使人们能够为他们的健康旅程做那种相互支持。“</p><p> Lynch points out that it’s not just about surfacing data that people might not otherwise find, but it’s actually about opening the door for more communication around health between families and personal networks that typically might never happen.</p><p> Lynch指出，它不仅仅是关于人们可能无法找到的资料，但它实际上是关于打开门，以便在家庭和通常可能永远不会发生的个人网络之间进行更多沟通。</p><p> “It enables conversations, where maybe people wouldn’t maybe naturally talk about how much they’ve been walking lately or how their sleep’s been going,” he said. “If you’re up for sharing that, then it can be a conversation that maybe you otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then it’s the same with doctor interactions; when you’re interacting with a doctor, they may not have a great view of your daily health. They have these little silo views of blood pressure at the time and stuff like that, so how can we help you tell your whole story when you’re talking with your doctor and make that conversation even richer than it would have been otherwise, in a very quick period of time?”</p><p> “它可以实现谈话，也许人们不会自然地谈论他们最近一直走的程度或者他们的睡眠是多么努力，”他说。 “如果你正在分享那个，那么它可能是一个可能的对话，否则你也不会有。然后与医生相互作用一样;当您与医生互动时，他们可能并不是对日常健康的看法。他们在那样拥有这些小筒仓的血压和血压，所以我们如何帮助您在与医生交谈时告诉您的整个故事，并使谈话更加丰富，而不是其它情况。非常快的时间？“</p><p> Sharing with a doctor relies on integrating with a healthcare provider’s electronic healthcare records (EHR) system, but Lynch notes that it’s using all interoperable standards to make this work, and they have a range of providers with large footprints in the U.S. already lined up to participate at launch. Healthcare professionals using this feature will be able to see data users share with them in a web view in their EHR system, and while that data is only shared ephemerally, they can easily annotate and store specific readings in their permanent EHR for a patient should they require it to back up a diagnosis or course of treatment.</p><p> 与医生分享依赖于与医疗保健提供者的电子医疗保健记录（EHR）系统集成，但Lynch指出它正在使用所有可互操作的标准来制定这项工作，并且他们拥有一系列具有大量占地面积的提供商已经排队参加发布。使用此功能的医疗保健专业人员将能够在其EHR系统中的Web视图中查看数据用户与它们共享，而该数据仅在单次分享时，它们可以轻松注释并将其永久EHR中的特定读数存储在他们的永久EHR中应为患者要求它备份诊断或治疗过程。</p><p> I asked Lynch about the state of EHR, which has had a tricky history in terms of adoption and interoperability, and he said that it’s true that this is something they initially started working on years ago, at a time when making it work would have required a much more massive technical undertaking on Apple’s side to make it actually work. Luckily, the industry in general has been trending toward adopting more open standards.</p><p> 我向ehr的状态要求埃希尔，在通过和互操作性方面存在棘手的历史，他说这是他们最初开始在几年前开始工作的事情，这是在使其工作所需的时间在苹果方面更加庞大的技术承诺，使其实际上工作。幸运的是，该行业一般一直贯彻采用更多开放标准。</p><p> “There really has been a change in how you can connect to the EHRs in a more standardized way,” he said. “And certainly, we’ve been working with and across all of them to help get this mature.”</p><p> 他说：“如何以更标准化的方式连接到EHRS的变化，”他说。 “当然，我们一直在合作，并在所有这些中都有帮助实现这一成熟。” </p><p>  One of the biggest potential benefits for both users and their doctors of Apple Health is just how much data they can gain access to over time. Apple users who have stuck with the platform and used Health have now been tracking at least heart rate data for around seven years. That’s why another iOS 15 feature, Health Trends, has even more potential future impact.</p><p>用户和他们的苹果健康医生的最大潜在利益之一就是他们可以随时间获得多少数据。陷入平台和二手健康的Apple用户现在已经在七年内跟踪了至少心率数据。这就是为什么另一个iOS 15功能，健康趋势，更潜在的未来影响。</p><p>  “Trends is looking at the longer term changes, and starting to identify what may be statistically significant changes in those areas,” Lynch explained. “There are about 20 areas that we’re starting with to do this, and if we start seeing those notable trends, then we can highlight those to you and show you how, for instance, your resting heart rates change now, you know, versus a year ago.”</p><p>  “趋势正在寻找长期变化，并开始确定这些区域可能存在统计上有统计学的变化，”林奇解释说。 “有大约20个区域，我们从这做了这一点，如果我们开始看到那些值得注意的趋势，那么我们可以突出显示那些对你的人，并告诉你如何，例如，你知道，你知道，你知道，你知道，你知道，你知道，与一年前。“</p><p> This is once again the result of the Apple Heart and Movement study and the insights that the company continues to derive from that work. During the study, Apple focused a lot on how to fine-tune insight delivery, so as to ensure that it was providing users with information they could use, but at the same time avoiding any kind of overload or generating more confusion.</p><p> 这再次成为苹果心脏和运动研究的结果以及公司继续派生那项工作的见解。在研究期间，Apple重点是如何进行微调的洞察力交付，以确保它为用户提供了他们可以使用的信息，但同时避免任何过载或产生更多的混乱。</p><p> “When you work on something like trends, we don’t want to overwhelm people with insights, if you will, but we also don’t want to like not have, you know, if there’s something relevant to show, we don’t want to suppress that. How do we tune that in? So we did a lot of that tuning with the data that we have in the Heart and Movement study, and we’re excited to see how it goes with the with public launch, and we’ll keep iterating on it. We think this is going to be a really powerful way for people to understand long-term changes.”</p><p> “当你在像潮流等类似的事情时，我们不想压倒人们的洞察力，如果你愿意，但我们也不想要没有，你知道，如果有什么相关的表演，我们就没有想要压制。我们如何调整它的？所以我们做了很多关于我们在心脏和运动研究中的数据调整，我们很高兴看到它如何与公开发布会如何，我们将继续迭代。我们认为这将是人们了解长期变化的一种非常有力的方式。“</p><p>  Apple’s health story to date is largely one made up of realizations that the sensors the iPhone and Apple Watch carry, originally for other purposes, can provide tremendous insights into our health on a continuous basis — something that previously just hasn’t been possible or practical. That evolved into an intentional strategy of seeking out new sensor technologies to integrate into Watch and other Apple devices to address even more daily health concerns, and Apple continues to figure out new ways to use the sensors that are there already — the addition of respiratory rate measurement during sleep in iOS 15 is a prime example — while working on what new hardware comes next to do even more.</p><p>  迄今为止迄今为止的苹果的健康故事主要是一个实现的传感器，即最初用于其他目的的传感器，可以持续地对我们的健康提供巨大的见解 - 以前刚刚尚未实现或实用。这进入了一个有意的策略，寻求新的传感器技术，以融入观察和其他苹果设备，以解决更多的日常健康问题，并且苹果继续弄清楚使用已经存在的传感器的新方法 - 增加了呼吸率IOS 15睡眠期间的测量是一个典范 - 在处理新硬件的过程中，续方甚至更多。</p><p> Perhaps one place to look for even more potential in terms of future health capabilities lies in sensor fusion, however. Walking steadiness is the result of not just the iPhone or the Apple Watch acting independently, but of what’s possible when the company can use them in combination. It’s another place where Apple’s tight integration of software and hardware give it an edge, and it multiplies as Apple’s ecosystem of devices, and the sensors they carry, continues to grow.</p><p> 然而，在未来的健康能力方面，也许一个寻找更具潜力的地方。然而，传感器融合在于传感器融合。行走的稳定是不仅是iPhone或Apple手表独立行动的结果，而且公司可以组合使用它们的可能性。这是Apple对软件和硬件的紧密集成的另一个地方，使其成为一个优势，它乘以Apple的设备生态系统，以及他们携带的传感器继续增长。</p><p> I ended our interview by asking Lynch about what kind of possibilities might open up when you consider that AirPods, too, contain their own sensors and gather different data that could complement that monitored by the iPhone and Apple Watch in terms of health.</p><p> 我通过询问Lynch关于当您考虑Airpods的情况下，询问我们的面试，这些可能性也包含他们自己的传感器并收集可能补充的不同数据，这些数据可以在健康方面得到iPhone和Apple手表监控。 </p><p> “We already do sensor fusion across some devices today, and I think there’s all kinds of potential here,” he said.</p><p>“我们今天已经在某些设备上进行了传感器融合，我认为这里有各种各样的潜力，”他说。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ios/">#ios</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/reveals/">#reveals</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/数据/">#数据</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
