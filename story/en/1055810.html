Take off your suit and tie. End your commute. Get paid for your craft.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34; gumroad使您可以：逃离您的9-5桌面工作。脱掉你的西装和领带。结束你的通勤。为您的工艺付款。＆＃34;</p><p> Today, that promise might not seem that unusual. Multiple companies like Patreon, Substack, Ko-Fi, Teachable, Cameo and others have all carved out space for themselves in the growing creator economy and promise their users similar things. But Gumroad&#39;s story, and the beliefs that define its strategy, break from the norm.</p><p> 今天，这一承诺可能似乎不寻常。像Patreon一样的多家公司，家谱，Ko-Fi，教育，客串和其他公司都在不断增长的创造者经济中拥有所有雕刻的空间，并承诺他们的用户类似的东西。但Gumroad＆＃39; s的故事，以及定义其战略的信念，从常规中断。</p><p> Sahil Lavingia founded Gumroad in 2011 after leaving his job at Pinterest, forfeiting his one-year cliff and going all-in on what he saw as a burgeoning market for people to sell their work. The next 10 years were not an easy road. Despite the creator economy&#39;s growing presence today, Lavingia wrote a blog titled &#34; Reflecting on my Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company&#34; which chronicled the startup&#39;s rocky history of layoffs, growth spurts, pressure to fold and how those experiences informed the way he runs the company today. As a result, Gumroad is a company that rejects the typical venture-backed metrics of success and instead chooses to operates on loose schedules and flexible hours. The pitch Gumroad makes to its creators is that they can quit their job, work at their leisure and get paid for their craft — so why shouldn&#39;t Gumroad hold itself to the same standard?</p><p> 萨希尔·拉威纳在2011年在Pinterest离开工作后成立了GumRoad，从而丧失了他的一年悬崖，并全力以赴，他认为他被认为是人们销售他们的工作的新兴市场。未来10年不是一个简单的道路。尽管创造者经济，但今天不断增长的成长，Lavingia撰写了一个标题为＆＃34的博客;反思我未能建立十亿美元的公司＆＃34;这是一年反击的裁员的裁员，生长刺激，折叠压力以及如何在他今天运行公司的情况下折叠的压力。因此，Gumroad是一家拒绝典型的风险投资支持度量的公司，而是选择在松散的时间表和灵活的时间内运行。球场古罗瓦对其创造者来说，他们可以戒掉他们的工作，休闲工作，为他们的工艺进行报酬 - 那么为什么不应该＆＃39; T gumroad保持同一标准？</p><p> That philosophical approach hasn&#39;t made Gumroad the most popular company in the space. Patreon, Substack and others are all growing rapidly despite being formed years later. But Lavingia is convinced that the ever-growing creator economy and Gumroad&#39;s philosophical approach will pay off in the end.</p><p> 这种哲学方法HASN＆＃39; T制作了GumRoad这个空间中最受欢迎的公司。尽管在几年后形成了帕勒，家人和其他人都迅速增长。但Lavingia相信，不断增长的创造创造者经济和古罗河＆＃39;哲学方法将在最后还清。</p><p> The Business of Business spoke to Lavingia about his read on the state of the creator economy, how Gumroad stacks up against the competition, and what it will take to make the space grow even faster than it already is.</p><p> 业务的业务与莱佛因对创作者经济的读书，古罗路如何反对竞争，以及使空间更快地增长的东西比它更快。</p><p>  You founded Gumroad in 2011. Around then, “influencers,” “creators,” and “personalities” were already a big part of the online culture and ecosystem, but they were not at all talked about or utilized in the way that they are today. What did you see back then before other big companies in the space like Patreon were getting started that you kind of identified as an opportunity and made you want to go all-in on Gumroad?</p><p>  您在2011年创立了Gumroad。然后，随后，“影响者”，“创作者”和“人物”已经是在线文化和生态系统的重要组成部分，但他们根本并不谈论或以他们今天的方式谈论或利用。你看到了什么，然后在帕勒顿的空间中的其他大公司开始前开始，你有点被认定为一个机会，让你想在gumroad上全力以赴？ </p><p> There&#39;s two parts to this. One was that I wanted to solve my own problem — I wanted to sell this pencil icon that I designed to my Twitter audience, and I didn&#39;t even have a website. I just had around 1,000 people following me on Twitter. This was kind of a new problem, because most of the time if you have an audience, it means you already have a website. The order of operations was flipped for me. Then the next phase of that was realizing that there are probably a lot of people who are having this experience right now because the internet is making it much easier to build an audience without needing a website. The insight I had was that people are connecting directly with their audience [via Instagram or YouTube or Twitter], and the next phase of that for me was commerce. You can talk to your fans directly — you don&#39;t need a record store or radio to get in front of them. That’s step one.</p><p>这两个部分到了。一个是我想解决自己的问题 - 我想卖掉我设计的铅笔图标，我设计为我的Twitter受众，我甚至没有网站。在推特上，我刚刚在我追随我的1000人。这是一个新的问题，因为大多数时候如果你有一个观众，这意味着你已经有一个网站。操作顺序是为我推翻的。然后，下一阶段意识到现在有很多人现在拥有这种体验的人，因为互联网使得在不需要一个网站的情况下建立观众更容易。我所拥有的洞察力是人们直接与他们的观众联系[通过Instagram或YouTube或Twitter]，而对我来说的下一阶段是商业。您可以直接与您的粉丝交谈 - 您不需要录制商店或收音机进入他们。这是第一步。</p><p> Step two was asking, “Well, why do you need the record label or radio star at all?” I felt like that structure was going to inevitably change because creators were just getting more and more powerful. Though, at the time, the “creator economy” was not even a word. I believe we were actually the first company to ever use the term “creator economy” in 2015, so it even took us three or four years to realize that this was really a new kind of use case from the term “influencer” that people were mostly using to describe things back in the day.</p><p> 第二步是问，“好吧，你为什么根本需要记录标签或无线电星？”我觉得这种结构将不可避免地改变，因为创作者只是越来越强大。虽然，当时，“创造者经济”甚至都是一个词。我相信我们实际上是2015年首次使用“创作者经济”一词的公司，所以它甚至需要我们三四年来意识到这是人们所在的“影响者”一词的新用例。大多数用来用来描述一天的东西。</p><p> In your blog about the history of Gumroad, you said that you had this all-star cast of angel investors. I’m curious — Since you talked about identifying the “creator economy” before people were catching on to it, was it difficult to sell those investors on your vision?</p><p> 在你的博客中，关于GumRoad的历史，你说你拥有这个天使投资者的全明星演员。我很好奇 - 因为你谈到了识别人们在人们捕获之前识别“创作者经济”，这是否难以向您的愿景销售这些投资者？</p><p> It was really easy, honestly. Most people were sold pretty early. The simple “why now?” was basically that every human being is going to be able to build an audience without any gatekeepers. The next step was this sort of deep unbundling of the storefront and the marketplace, which means people will be able to sell things on their own accord. This was also around the time when Bitcoin was first making waves — it was around $1 at the time — so a lot of people were talking about Bitcoin, decentralization, and unbundling even in 2011. I think that helped as well.</p><p> 真的，真的很容易。大多数人都很早就出售了。简单的“为什么现在？”基本上，每个人都将能够在没有任何看门人的情况下建立观众。下一步是这种深入的店面和市场的深度，这意味着人们将能够自己销售事物。这也是比特币首次制作浪潮的时候了，这是当时约为1美元 - 所以即使在2011年也谈论比特币，权力下放和分开的分裂。我认为也有所帮助。</p><p> So yeah, I think Chris Sacca, Naval, and some other folks got it even back then. Maybe they got   too  much, right? Because it turned out that maybe we were all a few years too early. Now, because of COVID, we’re really seeing a big boost and “Creator economy” is now becoming a term, but it&#39;s still insanely early.</p><p> 所以是的，我觉得克里斯卡卡，海军和其他一些人甚至回来了。也许他们太过分了，对吧？因为它结果可能是我们几年的时间。现在，由于Covid，我们真的看到了一个大的提升和“创造者经济”现在正在成为一个术语，但它仍然疯狂地疯狂地成为一个术语。</p><p>  On that note, could you talk about how Gumroad differs from services like Patreon, Ko-Fi Substack, and other companies that are in the creator economy space?</p><p>  在那张笔记中，你能谈谈Gumroad如何与帕勒顿，Ko-Fi家庭住宅等其他公司等服务不同？</p><p> We were first, but who cares, right? I think we just really try to prioritize the creator. I think the crowdfunding round that we did was in that vein — we asked, “How do we get creators equity in the company itself?” So I think that&#39;s just philosophically very different. Substack just raised $65 million at a $650 million valuation, and we raised $6 million at $100 million valuation from our customers and community. I don&#39;t think Substack really even considers themselves to be in the creator economy. I think they&#39;re really focused on kind of being this all-in-one solution. At Gumroad, we don&#39;t care as much about becoming massive; it&#39;s more about whether we can build a really great extensible product that&#39;s affordable, and also just way cheaper than Substack and Patreon. We’re also profitable. That&#39;s another big thing that a lot of these companies can&#39;t really say. They&#39;re generally losing money. Which if you&#39;re a creator, I think you probably want to be a little cautious with who you build your own business on top of.</p><p> 我们是第一个，但谁关心，对吧？我想我们真的试图确定创造者的优先考虑。我认为我们所做的众所周知是在那静脉里 - 我们问道，“我们如何在公司本身获得创作者股权？”所以我认为这只是哲学上非常不同。 Suppl刚筹集了6500万美元的估价，我们从客户和社区筹集了600万美元的估价值为600万美元。我不认为家人真的认为自己是在创造者经济中。我认为他们真的专注于这种全能的解决方案。在Gumroad，我们不关心巨大的照顾;它的更多关于我们是否可以建立一个非常伟大的可扩展产品，而且可以比家用和帕勒顿更便宜。我们也有利可图。那个＆＃39;这是许多这些公司可以＆＃39;真的说的那么重要。他们通常会亏钱。如果你＆＃39; re一个创造者，我认为你可能希望与你在顶部建立自己的业务的人有点谨慎。 </p><p> I found the philosophical differences you mentioned really compelling. When I was reading your blog. You quit your Pinterest job before your one-year cliff to pursue a passion, which means you had no payout. It reminded me almost immediately of the story that a lot of creators who jump to platforms like Gumroad end up telling. The pitch Gumroad makes to creators is to quit their job today and pursue their passions. Do you see that comparison, and does it make you think differently about Gumroad’s role in the creator economy?</p><p>我发现你提到的哲学差异真的引人注目。当我读你的博客时。在你的一年悬崖之前，你戒掉了你的热情工作，以追求激情，这意味着你没有付款。它让我想起了几乎立即让很多创造者跳到像Gumroad这样的平台的创造者结束了。球场Gumroad对创造者今天辞职并追求他们的激情。您是否看到比较，并且它会让您对GumRoad在创造者经济中的角色不同吗？</p><p> Yeah, totally. I like to think of Gumroad as a company built by creators for other creators. We hire a lot of our top Gumroad creators to basically run chunks of the organization because my belief is that they should be able to decide — and are probably better positioned, honestly — to make decisions on what we should be building or prioritizing.</p><p> 是的，完全。我喜欢将Gumroad视为由其他创造者创造者建造的公司。我们雇用了很多顶级Gumroad创作者，基本上运行组织的块，因为我的信念是他们应该能够决定 - 并且可能更好地定位，诚实 - 决定我们应该建立或优先考虑的决定。</p><p> I&#39;m not trying to be a Steve Jobs-ian visionary. I think some of these other companies, just by the nature of the beast, raise a bunch of capital and try to build a $5 billion or $10 billion company. To do that, you have to predict the future in a sense. My opinion was just like, “I&#39;m just going to build the best product. I’m going to talk to creators to make our product better, and I’m going to try to be pretty low-ego about it.” I don&#39;t think creators want someone to come in and say, “Hey we&#39;ve solved all your all your problems!” and take 10-15% of earnings and constantly make changes. A lot of creators just want the simple stuff to do what it does and they don&#39;t want it to get more expensive. At Gumroad, we want to be the onramp to the creator economy. We want to help people quit their jobs. If they use Gumroad and it helps them succeed, and they decide they want to go use Teachable or Patreon instead, they’re welcome to do that.</p><p> 我不是试图成为史蒂夫乔布斯梦想的历史。我认为这些其他公司中的一些，只是为了野兽的性质，提高了一堆资本，并试图建造50亿美元或100亿美元的公司。为此，您必须在某种意义上预测未来。我的意见就像，“我只是打造最好的产品。我要和创造者谈谈，让我们的产品更好，而且我将尝试非常低于自我。“我不认为创造者希望有人来说，“嘿，我们解决了所有问题！”并占10-15％的收益，不断变化。很多创造者只想让简单的东西做它所做的事情，他们不希望它变得更加昂贵。在Gumroad，我们希望成为创造者经济的宣传。我们希望帮助人们辞职。如果他们使用GumRoad并帮助他们成功，他们决定他们想去使用教育或帕勒顿，欢迎来看。</p><p>  &#34;If there is a “winner,” it’s not going to be purely about pricing or functionality. It&#39;s going to be about creator consensus. I think a lot of creators will pick the platform that feels more aligned with them philosophically.&#34; — Lavingia</p><p>  ＆＃34;如果有一个“赢家”，那就不会纯粹是关于定价或功能。它与创造者共识至关＃39;我认为很多创造者将选择与他们更加平衡的平台。＆＃34; - 拉丁岛</p><p>   We&#39;re bigger than Substack, by the way. We do far more revenue and volume than Substack or Cameo, but obviously we&#39;re not growing as fast. Sometimes I think that maybe I should get back on that path, but I just try to remind myself that the creator economy is not about making millions of dollars. In my view, the creator economy is about quitting your job, and it just seems kind of ironic to me [to be a company that says] we want to make it possible for more people to quit their jobs, but the way we do that is by basically hiring people and making them work 60 hours a week. That seems a bit weird. I just really want to kind of eat my own dog food and build a company in this really weird way where we don&#39;t have meetings or schedules or deadlines and we just hire dozens or hundreds of creators to chip in. And everyone gets paid, obviously.</p><p>   顺便说一下，我们比重塑更大。我们的收入和批量比家食或群体更多，但显然我们＆＃39;重复不快速发展。有时我认为也许我应该回到那条路，但我只是试着提醒自己，创造者经济并不是赚到数百万美元。在我看来，创造者经济是关于戒掉你的工作，似乎有点讽刺意味着我是一家表示的公司，我们希望更多人能够辞掉工作，但我们这样做的方式是基本上雇用人，并使他们每周工作60小时。这似乎有点奇怪。我真的想要吃自己的狗粮，并以这种真正奇怪的方式建立一家公司，在那里我们没有会议或时间表或截止日期，我们只是雇用了几十个或数百名创作者进入筹码。每个人都得到了显然。</p><p> I think a lot of VCs will hear that and say “Sorry, but you’re gonna die. This is a winner-take-all market.” But I just don&#39;t buy that. I think the creator economy is absolutely massive. Gumroad is gonna be a great business, and so are Substack and Patreon. The other thing I like to say is that if there is a “winner,” it’s not going to be purely about pricing or functionality. It&#39;s going to be about creator consensus. I think a lot of creators will pick the platform that feels more aligned with them philosophically. So my long-term map of that is that over time, these services will all roughly have the same functionality just like Shopify and Squarespace will basically offer the same functionality, but depending on what you care about you’ll choose one or the other.</p><p> 我认为很多vcs会听到这个消息并说“对不起，但你会死。这是一个赢家的所有市场。“但我只是不买那个。我认为创造者经济绝对是巨大的。 Gumroad将成为一个很棒的业务，也是家庭形式的家园和帕勒顿。另一件事我喜欢说，如果有一个“赢家”，它不会纯粹是关于定价或功能。它与创造者共识至关＃39;我认为很多创造者将选择与他们哲学相一致的平台。因此，我的长期地图是，随着时间的推移，这些服务将大致具有相同的功能，就像购物和广场一样，基本上会提供相同的功能，但取决于您关心的是您将选择一个或另一个。</p><p> It&#39;s refreshing to hear you talk about building a company this way. I&#39;m so used to interviewing founders who talk about the typical venture-backed metrics for success like rapid, non-stop growth and being the winner in their space.</p><p> 它令人耳目一新，听到你谈论这种方式建造公司。我曾经习惯于采访谈论典型风险支持的度量的创始人，以获得成功，如快速，不间断的增长，并成为他们空间中的胜利者。 </p><p> It&#39;s funny because I run a venture fund, so I write checks to startups. I’m not necessarily opposed to that way of thinking, but for me personally — and maybe this is just me being selfish — I just don&#39;t think I need to work 60 hours a week anymore. I don&#39;t say that to brag, but I do have a level of confidence that I did something correctly and I&#39;m pretty good at what I do. I don’t think a lot of people would have the confidence to crowdfund their company at a $100 million valuation. I get emails from VCs all the time that are like, “Hey, do you want to raise more money?” When that happens, I just say, “Look, please do the research on the way that I run Gumroad and then get back to me if this is something that you would want to fund.” Like, go read this article about how we have no full time employees and I don&#39;t have deadlines. [They always come back and say] “yeah, we don&#39;t really want to give you $30 million.” There’s a reason I’m very open. It saves everyone a lot of time.</p><p>它＆＃39;很有趣，因为我经营了一个风险投资，所以我写了检查到初创公司。我不一定反对那种思维方式，但对我而言，也许这只是我是自私的 - 我只是不认为我需要每周工作60小时。我不说这是为了吹嘘，但我确实有一种信心，我确实做了正确的东西，我很擅长我所做的事情。我不认为很多人都会有信心以1亿美元的估值克定公司。我一直从VCS获取电子邮件，“嘿，你想筹集更多钱吗？”当发生这种情况时，我只是说，“看，请在我运行gumroad的方式上进行研究，然后如果这是你想要资助的东西，请回复我。”喜欢，请阅读本文有关我们如何没有全职员工，我不遵守截止日期。 [他们总是回来说]“是的，我们真的想给你3000万美元。”有一个我很开放的原因。它节省了大量的时间。</p><p>  I want to pivot here to something that you said recently in a Clubhouse room.</p><p>  我想在这里枢转到你最近在一个俱乐部房间所说的东西。</p><p>  No, no! It’s nothing awful. You said, “It&#39;s easy to get caught up in millions of followers. But 400 followers is an insane amount of people. You&#39;d fly to another city to speak at an event with 400 people. 400 people subscribing to your newsletter for $10 a month is a living for almost anybody in the world.” That really changed the way that I think about the creator economy. I’d like to hear you talk about whether it&#39;s become easier or harder over time to be able to monetize a hobby with a smaller audience like 400. Is that something that Gumroad uniquely enables, or has it just evolved over time?</p><p>  不，不！这没什么可怕的。你说，“它＆＃39;很容易陷入困境的追随者。但是400名粉丝是一种疯狂的人。 ＆＃39; d飞到另一个城市，在400人中举行。 400人每月为10美元订购您的时事通讯，是世界上几乎任何人的生活。“这真的改变了我对创造者经济的看法。我想听你谈论它是否变得更容易或更难以随着时间的推移，能够用较小的观众货币化为400。是古罗罗独一无二的东西的东西，或者它刚刚随着时间的推移而进化？</p><p> I think it&#39;s a combination. Certainly Gumroad and other platforms have made it easier. But I do think that the larger shift is that consumers are used to this way of supporting creators more than they were in the past. If you asked somebody 10 years ago how they supported a YouTuber, they would have said that they watch their videos, which they make ad revenue on. But today it&#39;s much more complex. You can support people through a newsletter subscription, you could give them money for digital products, you can join their communities. Online courses are another thing that will be absolutely massive. I think the nice thing about COVID is that it really forced people to figure that out. Like, “What is the online version of the offline?” As it turns out, not too different.</p><p> 我认为它＆＃39;组合。当然gumroad和其他平台使其更容易。但我确实认为更大的转变是消费者习惯于这种支持创造者的方式比过去更多。如果您10年前询问某人，他们如何支持一个Youtuber，他们会说他们看他们的视频，他们拨打了广告。但今天它＆＃39;得更复杂。您可以通过通讯订阅支持人员，您可以为他们提供数码产品，您可以加入他们的社区。在线课程是另一件事绝对是巨大的。我认为关于Covid的好事是它真正强迫人们弄清楚。喜欢，“脱机的在线版是什么？”事实证明，不要太差异。</p><p>  &#34; We don&#39;t want to replace the record label with Gumroad; we want to get out of the way. And I think the top creators know that.&#34; — Lavingia</p><p>  ＆＃34;我们希望用gumroad替换记录标签;我们想摆脱困境。我认为顶级创造者知道。＆＃34; - 拉丁岛</p><p>   But the other thing I&#39;d say is that it&#39;s still very difficult. It sounds easy to have 400 people follow you on the internet. I think one of the issues with how easy it’s become to get started is that it makes people think that it&#39;s easy [to actually do]. Like, the technical burden is easier — the cost is zero — but you still have to become a really good writer. That doesn&#39;t happen overnight. So that part is sometimes lost on people where they think, “Oh, just because I   can  build an audience on the internet means that I   will .” But no, you still have to spend years getting good at your skill. You still need the thousands and thousands of hours of painting or writing. And I think that sometimes gets lost.</p><p>   但是另一件事我＆＃39; d说是它＆＃39仍然很难。有400人在互联网上关注你的声音很容易。我认为这是一个问题之一，它可以开始才能开始，是它让人们认为它＆＃39;很容易[实际上]。就像，技术负担更容易 - 成本为零 - 但你仍然必须成为一个非常好的作家。这一点也不会发生一夜之间。因此，那部分有时会丢失他们认为的人，“哦，只是因为我可以在互联网上建立观众意味着我会的。”但不，你仍然必须花年擅长你的技能。你仍然需要数千和数千小时的绘画或写作。我认为有时会迷失。</p><p> To use your 400-follower example, You could have 400 followers on Twitter, but really only 100 or fewer of those followers are “activated” and engaging with your content. How can a creator get the most out of their audience? How does somebody judge whether their platform is actually big enough to go independent via a service like Gumroad?</p><p> 要使用您的400跟随器示例，您可以在Twitter上有400个粉丝，但真的只有100个或更少的追随者是“激活”并与您的内容进行搞。创造者如何充分利用他们的受众？有人如何判断他们的平台是否实际上足够大，可以通过古罗罗等服务来独立吗？ </p><p> I think a lot of it comes down to the fidelity of those relationships, right? I think that generally, creators have a pretty good sense that they should be engaging with their audience back and forth through several modalities. It&#39;s kind of like product market fit, right? You should have a pretty good sense of if you&#39;re actually solving the problem that your audience has. I think the other thing to point out is that it&#39;s unlikely that you’ll have 100 people paying $10 a month, for example. Usually you have 80 people paying you $10 a month, and then you have 10 people paying you $50 bucks a month, and you have one person paying you $300 a month or $1000 a month because they’re your super fan who like wants to sit down with you and have a Zoom call one hour a week. Often what we see is that these people who run newsletters are doing it as lead generation for consulting businesses. So I think it&#39;s helpful for people to think about multiple revenue streams. It&#39;s very pure, to say, “I&#39;m gonna have 1000 people paying $1 a month.” But the truth is, generally, there&#39;s a first class ticket, a business class ticket, and an economy ticket. And those things scale. Because your audience is not all at the same income level, right?</p><p>我认为很多它归结为这些关系的保真度，对吧？我认为这一般，创造者有一个非常有意义的感觉，他们应该通过几种方式来回与他们的观众一起参与。它的＆＃39;类似产品市场适合，对吗？如果您＆＃39;重新解决您的受众所拥有的问题，您应该有一个非常好的感觉。我认为另一件事是指出它，例如，你有100人每月支付10美元的人。通常，你有80人支付每月10美元，然后你有10人支付每月50美元的钱，你有一个人每月支付300美元或每月1000美元，因为他们是你喜欢坐的超级粉丝和你在一起，每周有一个缩放电话。我们看到的是，这些运行新闻通讯的人正在作为咨询企业的主要发电。所以我认为它＆＃39;有助于人们思考多个收入流。它＆＃39;非常纯洁，说，“我有1000人支付1美元的人。”但实际上，一般来说，有一个第一类票，商业班票和经济票。和那些东西规模。因为你的观众并非所有收入水平都在，那么吧？</p><p> Do you think it&#39;s the role of a company like Gumroad to provide tools to help build and develop that audience? Or is it on the creator to build the audience and then go to a platform?</p><p> 您认为它是否像GumRoad这样的公司的角色，以提供帮助构建和发展观众的工具？或者是在创造者上建立观众然后去一个平台吗？</p><p> It&#39;s funny — people are pretty split on this. A lot of creators, especially the ones who are just getting started or thinking about getting started, like to ask, “Hey, does Gumroad help with distribution? Will you give me sales?” Or they’ll say, “I&#39;m an amazing writer, but I don&#39;t have an audience.” To be honest, I&#39;m always a little skeptical of those people. Because if you&#39;re a really great writer, you should have some people who want to read that stuff. It also makes me worry because generally people who really like doing something are doing it already. When people are waiting for the panacea, it often means that they actually don&#39;t want to do the hard work.</p><p> 它＆＃39;有趣 - 人们对此很漂亮。很多创造者，特别是那些刚刚开始或思考入门的人，喜欢问，“嘿，古董帮助分发吗？你会给我销售吗？“或者他们会说，“我是一个惊人的作家，但我没有观众。”说实话，我总是对那些人持怀疑态度。因为如果你＆＃39;重新成为一个非常棒的作家，你应该有一些想要阅读那种东西的人。它也让我担心，因为一般来说真的喜欢做某事的人已经这样做了。当人们在等待灵丹妙药时，它经常意味着他们实际上不会＆＃39想要做艰苦的工作。</p><p> I think most creators don&#39;t actually want Gumroad to participate in the discovery. We don&#39;t want to become the new middleman. We don&#39;t want to replace the record label with Gumroad; we want to get out of the way. And I think the top creators know that. They also know that the economics become very different, right? If we start to drive more and more of their traffic, that gives us the leverage, and we can charge more money. So I always think it&#39;s healthy for a creator to have their own audience to be able to communicate with them directly.</p><p> 我认为大多数创造者不会＆＃39; t实际上想要gumroad参加发现。我们不想成为新的中间人。我们希望用gumroad替换记录标签;我们想摆脱困境。我认为顶级创造者知道这一点。他们还知道经济学变得非常不同，对吧？如果我们开始推动越来越多的流量，那就给了我们杠杆，我们可以收取更多金钱。所以我总是认为它是一个健康的创造者，让自己的受众能够直接与他们沟通。</p><p> As the creative economy grows, how will the role of platforms like Gumroad, Patreon and others develop over the next 10 years?</p><p> 随着创意经济的增长，平台像Gumroad，Patreon等的平台的角色如何在未来10年内发展？</p><p> I think financial services is going to be a big thing that we do probably in the next five to 10 years. Things like helping creators spin up LLCs or help them split pay with their bandmates. I think the difficulty with that is that you just need a lot of scale. There are a lot of things that we could get into with accounting services for creators. However, we&#39;re still very small. The number one thing I tell people trying to start creator economy companies is that you need a   lot  of creators. Gumroad has roughly as many creators using the product as Shopify did when they IPOd. All you are as a platform is the growth of your customers.</p><p> 我认为金融服务将成为我们可能在未来五到10年的大事。像帮助创造者旋转LLC的东西，或帮助他们用他们的携带件拆分支付。我认为这是你只需要大量的规模。有很多事情可以在创作者中进入会计服务。但是，我们＆＃39仍然很小。我告诉人们试图启动创作者经济公司的数字是你需要很多创造者。 Gumroad大致多于使用产品的创造者，因为它们在iPod时备份。所有你都是平台的是您的客户的增长。</p><p> I did an interview recently with Austin Rief of Morning Brew, and one of the questions I asked him was, “How does Morning Brew prevent itself from running into the situation you often see where a very popular writer decides to leave and go to Substack to start their own newsletter?” He said that the company needs to create a flywheel where they offer editors, different ways to monetize — all these things to make Morning Brew an appealing place for creators to stay. I want to ask you about the flip side of that equation. Is it the goal of companies in the creator economy to pull creators away from where they’re at and towards their platform?</p><p> 我最近对早晨酿造的奥斯汀旅游业进行了采访，以及我问他的问题之一，“早晨啤酒如何防止自己跑进局势，你经常看到一个非常受欢迎的作者决定离开并搬到什么开始自己的时事通讯？“他说，该公司需要创建一个飞轮，他们提供编辑，不同的方式可以通过这些方式 - 所有这些东西让早晨酿造了一个吸引人的创造者留下的地方。我想向您询问那个方程的翻转方。是公司在创作者经济中的目标，将创造者拉出他们在他们的平台上的地方吗？ </p><p> I think Gumroad’s goal is that we want to provide a really great suite of software that creators can choose to use to basically get leverage over the traditional media industry that they&#39;re in. We want to be able to do that affordably, profitably, and sustainably. I think for Substack, they&#39;re on a path where, for this to be a success for their new funding round, they probably have to become a multi, multi, multi-billion dollar company. The market’s just not big enough for that yet; they&#39;re gonna have to pull people away from other outlets.</p><p>我认为Gumroad的目标是，我们希望提供一套非常大的软件，即创建者可以选择使用，基本上得到传统媒体行业的杠杆，他们＆＃39;我们希望能够合理，有利可图和可持续的。我认为是重置，他们＆＃39;重新在一条路上，因为这对他们的新资金循环取得了成功，他们可能必须成为一个多元化的多十亿美元的公司。该市场对此不够大;他们＆＃39;重新将人们拉离其他网点。</p><p> But to Austin&#39;s point, the truth is that most people don&#39;t want to be part of the creator economy, and I don&#39;t know if that will ever really change. Most people I talk to on a daily basis are very happy getting paid a salary and getting health care. I think if you talked to most musicians you’d see that the vast majority want to sign with a label because they want to have someone help them do it right. With Gumroad, I want to make it easier and easier for people to choose to go independent, but I understand that no matter how easy we make it, if there are other cognitive burdens that mean most people will never do it. And I hope I’m wrong. [Personally], I can&#39;t imagine working for somebody. I worked for Pinterest for eight months and that&#39;s the only job I&#39;ve ever really had and probably ever will. So I just can&#39;t fathom working a nine-to-five, But most of my friends can&#39;t fathom   not  doing that.</p><p> 但对于奥斯汀＆＃39; spe，事实是，大多数人都不会成为创造者经济的一部分，我不知道这是否会真正改变。我每天谈论的大多数人都非常幸福地获得了薪水和保健。我想如果你和大多数音乐家谈到你看到绝大多数想要与标签签名，因为他们想要有人帮助他们对他们做对。通过GumRoad，我想让人们更容易，让人们选择独立，但我理解，无论我们如何让它变得多么容易，如果还有其他认知的负担，那意味着大多数人永远不会这样做。我希望我错了。 [个人]，我可以和＃39想象一下。我在八个月内工作了八个月，＆＃39;这是唯一的工作和＃39; vere真的，可能会有。所以我只能＆＃39; t fathom工作了九到五个，但我的大多数朋友可以＆＃39; t fathom没有这样做。</p><p>  Is there anyone in the creator economy or otherwise who’s really captivated you and you recommend people pay attention to?</p><p>  创造者经济中有人还是否则谁真正着迷了你，你建议人们注意？</p><p> What I&#39;m really interested in is regulation. The number one thing holding back the creator economy is not better software; I think it&#39;s the fact that you don&#39;t get health care. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#</p><p> 我真的很感兴趣的是什么。遏制创作者经济的数字是不是更好的软件;我认为它和＃39;你没有得到医疗保健的事实。也许它＆＃39; s只是因为我＆＃</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/sahil-lavingia-interview-rise-of-creator-economy/">https://www.businessofbusiness.com/videos/sahil-lavingia-interview-rise-of-creator-economy/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/lavingia/">#lavingia</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/创造者/">#创造者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
