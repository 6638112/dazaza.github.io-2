The startup focuses primarily on small and medium companies as well as freelancers. It currently operates in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n Tiger Global and  TCV are leading today\u2019s funding round. With 220,000 clients, Qonto still plans to grow at a rapide pace in the coming years. \u201cOur goal is to reach one million SMEs by 2025,\u201d co-founder and CEO Alexandre Prot told me. \u201cAnd we know that Tiger and TCV have supported quite a few companies to reach that scale.\u201d\n  Some new investors are also participating in the round, such as Alkeon, Eurazeo, KKR, Insight Partners, Exor Seeds, Guillaume Pousaz, Gaingels and Ashley Flucas. Existing investors Valar, Alven, DST Global and Tencent are putting more money on the table as well.\n That\u2019s quite a long list of investors and Qonto proves once again that private equity firms are actively looking for late-stage growth rounds in Europe.\n   What\u2019s interesting with Qonto is that it\u2019s a truly European startup. In the U.S., spend management solutions, such as  Brex and  Ramp, have been massively successful. As The Information\u2019s Kate Clark reported, they want to  replace American Express and hand out corporate cards to millions of employees in the U.S.\n Qonto started out with business bank accounts because that\u2019s the key financial component of European companies. Many companies use their bank accounts directly to move money around. They initiate transfers, share their bank account number (IBAN) to receive a payment and set up direct debits to pay bills.\n And Qonto does that really well. You can sign up from a computer and get a local IBAN a few minutes later. After that, you can also order debit cards to pay with your card.\n At first, Qonto relied heavily on a third-party banking partner \u2014  Treezor. The startup then applied to get its own license to become a payment institution. In 2020, Qonto moved all its clients to its in-house core banking system. The company now owns this critical part of the technical stack.\n Qonto has expanded beyond the simple bank account. The startup\u2019s CEO Alexandre Prot defines Qonto as three different products rolled into a single service. In addition to the everyday banking part, it also simplifies bookkeeping and accounting. It can become your spend management solution as well.\n On the bookkeeping front, Qonto lets you export or sync with your  existing accounting solution. This is a fragmented market as each country uses different accounting tools. For instance, you can export your data to Cegid if you\u2019re a French company, you can synchronize with Datev if you\u2019re a German company, etc. Qonto users can also import receipts directly in their Qonto account.\n As for spend management, Qonto lets you hand out physical, virtual or one-time cards to employees. Admins can set up different spending limits, an approval workflow and all the usual stuff that you get from a spend management solution. It might not be as feature complete as a dedicated product, such as  Spendesk, but it could be enough for small companies.\n For everything else, Qonto partners with other fintech startups. For instance, customers can open a credit line with  October and borrow \u20ac15,000 to \u20ac30,000. Customers can also open a savings account with  Cashbee and its banking partner My Money Bank.\n   There are 220,000 companies paying for Qonto every month. Pricing ranges from \u20ac9 per month for the most basic freelancer account to \u20ac249 per month for enterprise accounts. On top of that, some companies pay more to get more cards or when they go above certain limits.\n What makes the business model even more lucrative is that a lot of customers just sign up on their own. When they create their company, they use Qonto for the initial capital deposit in order to register the company. Essentially, Qonto combines inbound marketing with the high margins of a SaaS product.\n \u201cAround a third of our customers created their companies with us. It\u2019s their first account and the only one that they use,\u201d Alexandre Prot said. \u201cTwo-thirds of our customers are companies that existed before they opened an account with us. Roughly half of them close their existing bank account, half of them use Qonto in parallel with one or several accounts.\u201d\n With today\u2019s funding round, the company plans to grow its team from 500 employees to 2,000 people by 2025. Qonto will also invest heavily in its existing markets. \u201cWe will be able to invest more than \u20ac100 million on each of our markets,\u201d Prot said. While there are still a lot of SMEs that are not using Qonto in France, Germany, Spain and Italy, Qonto also plans to enter new market in 2023.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 13:58:08", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5546\u4e1a,\u4e1a\u52a1,billion", "title": "\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u542f\u52a8Qonto\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86552\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee550\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u4ef7", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBusiness banking startup Qonto raises $552 million at $5 billion valuation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5546\u4e1a", "\u4e1a\u52a1", "billion"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5fe52fdbbbce1c67cec2ababda465405.jpg", "infoid": 1072731, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u5de8\u578b\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u96c6\u56e2\u548c\u4ebf\u4e07\u5bcc\u7fc1Kumar Mangalam Birla\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\u7ea6\u4e3a67.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u80a1\u6743\u540e\uff0c\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u80a1\u6743\u5c06\u7a00\u91ca\u81f328.5\uff05\uff0c\u800cAditya Birla\u96c6\u56e2\u5c06\u7f29\u5c0f\u523017.8\uff05\u3002\u5370\u5ea6\u653f\u5e9c\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\u3002\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5927\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546Bharti Airtel\u4e5f\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\uff0c\u4e0a\u5468\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8f6c\u6362\u5ef6\u671f\u9891\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u652f\u4ed8\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8d39\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u5229\u606f\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6551\u63f4\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56JIO\u7684\u5230\u6765\u53d7\u4f24\u7684\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7531\u4e9a\u6d32\u6700\u5bcc\u6709\u7684\u4ebaMukesh Ambani\u906d\u5230\u524a\u5f31\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc74\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u7535\u4fe1\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u3002\nAirtel\u548cVodafone Idea\u5728\u6b20\u653f\u5e9c\u7684140\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4e0a\u5bfb\u6c42\u6551\u6d4e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8bf7\u6c42\u53bb\u5e74\u5370\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u9a73\u56de\u4e86\u3002\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u60f3\u6cd5\u9ad8\u7ba1\u53bb\u5e749\u6708\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5e0c\u671b\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u652f\u4ed8\u4f1a\u8d39\u3002", "note_en": "The operator, which is a joint venture between the British giant Vodafone Group and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla\u2019s conglomerate, owed the government dues of roughly $6.76 billion.\u00a0Following the conversion into equity, Vodafone Group\u2019s shareholding will be diluted to 28.5% while Aditya Birla Group\u2019s will shrink to 17.8%. The Indian government will become the largest shareholder in the wireless telecom operator.\n Shares of Vodafone Idea dropped 12.46% on the news and was trading at \u20b913 apiece at 11 am local time.\n  Bharti Airtel, the second largest telecom operator which also owes dues to the government, said last week it won\u2019t be converting the interest on deferred spectrum related payments and government dues into equity.\n Tuesday\u2019s announcement comes months after the Indian government gave operators more time to pay dues on  a two-decade dispute last year. (The Indian government and telecom operators have for a decade disputed how gross revenue should be calculated. The government has mandated the license and spectrum fee to be paid by operators as a share of their revenue. Telcos had argued that only core income accrued from use of spectrum should be considered for calculation of adjusted gross revenue.)\n The rescue plan, nonetheless, was critical to both the telecom operators who have been hurt by the arrival of Reliance Jio, run by Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, which undercut their offerings to become the top Indian telecom operator with over 400 million subscribers.\n Many private phone operators exited the market, merged with rivals, or filed for bankruptcy after Jio lured away subscribers with cheap data and free calls. Vodafone Idea hasn\u2019t reported annual profits since 2017.\n  Airtel and Vodafone Idea had sought relief on the $14 billion they owe to the government, a plea the Indian Supreme Court rejected last year. Vodafone Idea executives said in September last year that the company was hopeful of successfully raising funds to pay the dues.\n Analysts were expecting that Vodafone Idea won\u2019t have to resort to diluting its dues into equity. \u201cWith the recent ~20% tariff hikes and Vi having likely tied up the funding for repaying the non-convertible debentures maturing between December 2021 and February 2022, its prospects have improved. In our view, Vi is likely to continue its fund-raising efforts from its promoters and other investors rather than letting the government acquire a significant stake,\u201d brokerage firm IIFL said Monday.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 13:57:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30,idea,\u96c6\u56e2", "title": "\u5728\u4f1a\u8d39\u8f6c\u6362\u540e\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u5728\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u4e2d\u62e5\u670935.8\uff05", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia to own 35.8% in Vodafone Idea after conversion of dues\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/vodafone-idea-india-government/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6c83\u8fbe\u4e30", "idea", "\u96c6\u56e2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a25414c340ca8beb7ea56829ba2f6456.jpg", "infoid": 1072730, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4e00\u65e5\u665a\u4e0a\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u6c61\u96e8\u4e0a\uff0c\u5df4\u897f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08Eduarda Martins Delcourt\u6b63\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u5357\u91cc\u5965\u5fb7\u00b7\u6770\u5c3c\u7f57\u6765\u5230\u5979\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u5723\u8bde\u8282\u3002\u5979\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b2\u52a8\u662f\u6253\u5f00\u5979\u7684\u4f18\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cMartins Delcourt\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8ba9\u5979\u7684\u5988\u5988\u4f7f\u7528Taxi.Rio\u8ba2\u8d2d\u4e86\u5979\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5ba4\uff0c\u7531\u91cc\u7ea6\u70ed\u5185\u5362\u653f\u5e9c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5c06\u9a91\u624b\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u3002 Taxi.Rio\u6536\u53d6\u4e8618\u5c81\u7684Reais\uff08\u7ea6\u54082.80\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u9a91\u884c -

Her first impulse was to open her Uber app.\n Uber indicated that the 15-minute trip would set her back 40 reais (around $7) \u2014 more than double what she had remembered paying for a similar trip just a couple years back.\n So, Martins Delcourt closed the app and had her mom order her a cab using Taxi.Rio, an app developed by the Rio de Janeiro government to connect riders to the traditional taxi service. Taxi.Rio charged just 18 reais (around $2.80) for the same ride \u2014 less than half of what Uber was asking.\n Martins Delcourt is part of a growing number of Brazilians ditching Uber for taxis, which are now becoming cheaper and easier to come by. According to the Union of Autonomous Taxi Drivers of the Municipality of Rio, demand for Rio taxi services, which now operate in a number of cities across Brazil, rose by  60% at the tail end of 2021. Taxi.Rio added roughly 38,000 monthly users in 2021, according to official Rio city government figures.\n Meanwhile, statistics from the state of Rio de Janeiro found that traditional taxis clocked around 226,800,000 completed trips in 2021, compared to 136,080,000 in the same period the previous year, claimed Rodrigo Lopes Cosendey, the general secretary of Rio Niteroi Municipality Taxi Driver\u2019s Union.\n Monthly completed trips in Brazil for Uber and 99, owned by Chinese tech giant DiDi, have not been disclosed to the public, but they are believed to have 28 million active users combined \u2013\u2013 approximately  90% of the Brazilian population \u2013\u2013\u00a0with 99 boasting 750,000 active drivers, compared to Uber\u2019s over 600,000.\n In recent years though, new, lesser-known competitors, like Taxi.Rio and  Lady Driver, have captured around 8% of Brazilian users.\n The shift back to traditional cabs was spurred in large part by pricing and longer wait times. Uber and 99 are grappling with driver shortages and high demand, which has translated to price surcharges, including a 30% increase over two months last fall, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n Andreia Santos, another Rio native, told  Rest of World that Uber charged her almost 150 reais (around $27) for a roughly 30-minute trip on New Year\u2019s eve. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of my weekly grocery trip,\u201d she said.\n   Meanwhile, taxi cab prices across Brazil are set by local authorities and have seen minimal increases over the past three years. And populous urban centers like Rio de Janeiro have recently invested heavily in apps like Taxi.Rio, which aim to make hailing a cab just as easy as hailing an Uber. This has meant that Brazilians have gradually begun to find traditional taxis are often cheaper and more convenient alternatives than private ride-hailing apps.\n \u201cGiven the increased demand for trips, there are many who are returning to taxis or even discovering them for the first time,\u201d Alessandro Ruiz Martinez, a leader of the National Taxi Front (Frennataxi), a union, told  Rest of World.\n A surging demand for rides and a limited pool of drivers have led to recent surges in Uber prices in  England and the  U.S., among other countries. But in Brazil, ride-hailing apps are in a particular bind because of spiking inflation, largely driven by high fuel prices.\n In Rio de Janeiro, as in the rest of Brazil, where the majority of drivers use  gasoline to fill their tanks, the price of gas has soared  by up to 46% in 2021. Natural gas had also risen by nearly  40% in 2021.\n For drivers, the addition of exorbitant gas prices to the cost of the ride-hailing companies\u2019 30% cut can be discouraging. \u201cIf it\u2019s a short trip, it\u2019s just not worth accepting the fare,\u201d Wilson Lucas, a 22-year-old driving for both Uber and 99 in Rio, told  Rest of World. He drives 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and takes home an average of under 1,900 reais (around $337) in a good month.\n And that money is worth less and less every day. While yearly inflation as measured by consumer price index is at 6.8% and 7.37% in the U.S. and Mexico respectively, Brazil is grappling with a 10.74% rate. Though surging gas prices affect both Uber and taxi drivers equally, Rio cabbies make a monthly base salary of 4,500 reais (approx $800), says Cosendey of the Taxi Union and can take home most of what they make on the road \u2014 Rio City Hall takes only a 5% cut, as opposed to the private apps\u2019  10%\u201335% commission.\n  Metered taxi fares are also determined by the regional municipality in advance, operating on what is known locally as the \u201c Bandeira 2\u201d system, where fares can increase by as much as  20%\u201340% during busy peak periods, like bank holidays and Saturday nights. Unlike the apps\u2019 dynamic pricing model, however, trip prices increase during fixed times.\n Uber, which still maintains  70% of the rider share market in Brazil, is improving its service to draw riders back. In September, the company banned 1,600 drivers from using its service for excessive cancellations. The company is also hoping to attract new talent and told  Rest of World that it was seeking to keep drivers on the road by instituting cashback schemes for health care and mobile plans, as well as at the fuel pump \u2014 although the refueling incentive adds up to just 600 reais (just over $100) a year.\n Still, municipal efforts like Taxi.Rio are putting up a fight. Launched in 2017, Taxi.Rio has something that private ride-hailing apps do not: local regulations that favor the local taxi service. For instance, the Rio government has offered cabs on Taxi.Rio the freedom to use  express bus lanes, which can drastically cut trip fares and times.\n The mayor has also  announced plans to tax private car-hailing apps, such as Uber, at a rate of 1.5% for using public roadways as part of a wider smart city initiative to reduce congestion. Taxi.Rio, legally designated as public transport, was exempted from the regulation.\n According to the Rio government\u2019s official figures, Taxi.Rio currently has 33,000 active drivers;  80% of the Rio state\u2019s 90,000 traditional taxi drivers are currently registered on the app. Between October and November last year, when Brazil grappled with two months of double-digit inflation, Taxi.Rio also reported an 8% increase in passengers and a 26% surge in completed trips, Kley Pontes, the main technical coordinator of IplanRio, Rio\u2019s municipal computer company, told  Rest of World.\n Edson Neves, a taxi driver who began working at Uber when the company first arrived in Brazil, made the move back to traditional taxis three months ago, when he realized that drivers\u2019 costs had increased while their workers\u2019 rights had diminished drastically, in the past year.\n For analysts, the question is how and whether Taxi.Rio will be able to maintain momentum beyond the specific moment of driver shortages, inflation, and the unemployment crisis in Brazil.\n  For Pedro Paulo Albuquerque, CEO at a Bras\u00edlia-based technology startup named Skill, the apps\u2019 current bottlenecks have offered an additional option for segments of the Brazilian population seeking express rides \u2014 particularly during rush hour, rainy days, and airport trips. However, he doesn\u2019t see state-backed ride-hailing alternatives replacing private apps. \u201cFor Taxi.Rio to truly prosper, it needs easy access and the ability to develop high-performance technology that goes beyond what a government department is capable of.\u201d\n Still, Neves won\u2019t be going back to Uber or 99 anytime soon, even if inflation subsides. \u201cWorking as a taxi driver is a profession, [with Taxi.Rio] we have security,\u201d he said.\n Yet Lucas, the 22-year-old Uber and 99 driver, says he\u2019ll wait it out. For him and many more struggling Brazilians accustomed to informal labor, the flexibility of working on the private apps \u2014 something that Taxi.Rio does not offer \u2014 has helped them when few employment alternatives are available. If prospects improve in the city, however, he dreams of one day completing his course in the military.

Can the 36 officers be arranged in a 6-by-6 square so that no row or column repeats a rank or regiment?\n The puzzle is easily solved when there are five ranks and five regiments, or seven ranks and seven regiments. But after searching in vain for a solution for the case of 36 officers, Euler concluded that \u201csuch an arrangement is impossible, though we can\u2019t give a rigorous demonstration of this.\u201d More than a century later, the French mathematician Gaston Tarry proved that, indeed, there was no way to arrange Euler\u2019s 36 officers in a 6-by-6 square without repetition. In 1960, mathematicians used computers to  prove that solutions exist for any number of regiments and ranks greater than two, except, curiously, six.\n Similar puzzles have entranced people for more than 2,000 years. Cultures around the world have made \u201cmagic squares,\u201d arrays of numbers that add to the same sum along each row and column, and \u201cLatin squares\u201d filled with symbols that each appear once per row and column. These squares have been used in art and urban planning, and just for fun. One popular Latin square \u2014 Sudoku \u2014 has subsquares that also lack repeating symbols. Euler\u2019s 36 officers puzzle asks for an \u201corthogonal Latin square,\u201d in which two sets of properties, such as ranks and regiments, both satisfy the rules of the Latin square simultaneously.\n  But whereas Euler thought no such 6-by-6 square exists, recently the game has changed. In  a paper posted online and submitted to  Physical Review Letters, a group of quantum physicists in India and Poland demonstrates that it is possible to arrange 36 officers in a way that fulfills Euler\u2019s criteria \u2014 so long as the officers can have a quantum mixture of ranks and regiments. The result is the latest in a line of work developing quantum versions of magic square and Latin square puzzles, which is not just fun and games, but has applications for quantum communication and quantum computing.\n \u201cI think their paper is very beautiful,\u201d said  Gemma De las Cuevas, a quantum physicist at the University of Innsbruck who was not involved with the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of quantum magic in there. And not only that, but you can feel throughout the paper their love for the problem.\u201d\n The new era of quantum puzzling began in 2016, when  Jamie Vicary of the University of Cambridge and his then-student Ben Musto had the idea that the entries appearing in Latin squares could be made quantum.\n  In quantum mechanics, objects such as electrons can be in a \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple possible states: here and there, for example, or magnetically oriented both up and down. (Quantum objects stay in this limbo until they are measured, at which point they settle on one state.) Entries of quantum Latin squares are also quantum states that can be in quantum superpositions. Mathematically, a quantum state is represented by a vector, which has a length and direction, like an arrow. A superposition is the arrow formed by combining multiple vectors. Analogous to the requirement that symbols along each row and column of a Latin square not repeat, the quantum states along each row or column of a quantum Latin square must correspond to vectors that are perpendicular to one another.\n Quantum Latin squares were quickly adopted by a community of theoretical physicists and mathematicians interested in their unusual properties. Last year, the French mathematical physicists  Ion Nechita and Jordi Pillet created a quantum version of Sudoku \u2014  SudoQ. Instead of using the integers 0 through 9, in SudoQ the rows, columns and subsquares each have nine perpendicular vectors.\n These advances led  Adam Burchardt, a postdoctoral researcher at Jagiellonian University in Poland, and his colleagues to reexamine Euler\u2019s old puzzle about the 36 officers. What if, they wondered, Euler\u2019s officers were made quantum?\n In the classical version of the problem, each entry is an officer with a well-defined rank and regiment. It\u2019s helpful to conceive of the 36 officers as colorful chess pieces, whose rank can be\u00a0 king, queen, rook, bishop, knight or pawn, and whose regiment is represented by red, orange, yellow, green, blue or purple. But in the quantum version, officers are formed from superpositions of ranks and regiments. An officer could be a superposition of a red king and an orange queen, for instance.\n Critically, the quantum states that compose these officers have a special relationship called entanglement, which involves a correlation between different entities. If a red king is entangled with an orange queen, for instance, then even if the king and queen are both in superpositions of multiple regiments, observing that the king is red tells you immediately that the queen is orange. It\u2019s because of the peculiar nature of entanglement that officers along each line can all be perpendicular.\n  The theory seemed to work, but to prove it, the authors had to construct a 6-by-6 array filled with quantum officers. A vast number of possible configurations and entanglements meant they had to rely on computer help. The researchers plugged in a classical near-solution (an arrangement of 36 classical officers with only a few repeats of ranks and regiments in a row or column) and applied an algorithm that tweaked the arrangement toward a true quantum solution. The algorithm works a little like solving a Rubik\u2019s Cube with brute force, where you fix the first row, then the first column, second column and so on. When they repeated the algorithm over and over, the puzzle array cycled closer and closer to being a true solution. Eventually, the researchers reached a point where they could see the pattern and fill in the few remaining entries by hand.\n Euler was, in a sense, proved wrong \u2014 though he couldn\u2019t have known, in the 18th century, about the possibility of quantum officers.\n \u201cThey close the book on this problem, which is already very nice,\u201d said Nechita. \u201cIt\u2019s a very beautiful result and I like the way they obtain it.\u201d\n One surprising feature of their solution, according to the coauthor Suhail Rather, a physicist at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, was that officer ranks are entangled only with adjacent ranks (kings with queens, rooks with bishops, knights with pawns) and regiments with adjacent regiments. Another surprise was the coefficients that appear in the entries of the quantum Latin square. These coefficients are numbers that tell you, essentially, how much weight to give different terms in a superposition. Curiously, the ratio of the coefficients that the algorithm landed on was \u03a6, or 1.618\u2026, the famous golden ratio.\n The solution is also what\u2019s known as an Absolutely Maximally Entangled state (AME), an arrangement of quantum objects that\u2019s thought to be important for a number of applications including quantum error-correction \u2014 ways of redundantly storing information in quantum computers so that it survives even if there\u2019s data corruption. In an AME, correlations between measurements of quantum objects are as strong as they can be: If Alice and Bob have entangled coins, and Alice tosses her coin and gets heads, she knows for sure that Bob has tails, and vice versa. Two coins can be maximally entangled, and so can three, but not four: If Carol and Dave join the coin toss, Alice can never be sure what Bob gets.\n  The new research proves, however, that if you have a set of four entangled dice, rather than coins, these can be maximally entangled. The arrangement of the six-sided dice is equivalent to the 6-by-6 quantum Latin square. Because of the golden ratio\u2019s presence in their solution, the researchers have dubbed this a \u201cGolden AME.\u201d\n \u201cI think it\u2019s highly nontrivial,\u201d said De las Cuevas. \u201cNot only that it exists, but they provide the state explicitly and analyze it.\u201d\n Researchers have previously devised other AMEs by starting with classical error-correcting codes and finding analogous, quantum versions. But the newfound golden AME is different, with no classical cryptographic analogue. Burchardt suspects it could be the first of a new class of quantum error-correcting codes. Then again, it might be equally interesting if the golden AME remains unique.\n Correction: January 10, 2022  T his article originally identified Suhail Rather as a mathematician, when in fact he is a physicist.\n Editor\u2019s note: The author of this article is related to an editor at\u00a0Physical Review Letters , where the quantum Latin squares paper has been submitted for publication.

Chopped and processed fruits are exempt from the ban.\n There are a lot of things wrong with our (over)use of plastic.\u00a0 Pollution from discarded plastic is a major concern.\u00a0 As we all know, both large pieces of plastic and microplastic particles can have nasty environmental effects.\u00a0 The other big problem with plastic is that it is mostly made from fossil fuels; carbon-rich materials that we should be leaving in the ground.\n  There\u2019s a reason we started using plastic to pack food last century: it is very good at protecting food during transport, storage and display. It protects food from spoilage, from damage and from contamination.\u00a0 Plastic packaging makes it easier for manufacturers, retailers and consumers to transport, store and display and buy food. Compared to non-plastic alternatives, plastic packaging is lighter, cheaper, more impact-resistant and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 more appealing to consumers.\n Products like mass-produced bread rely on plastic packaging to retain moisture so they stay fresher for longer.\u00a0 Without plastic, many staple foods like mass-produced bread, which feeds millions of people every day, would be much more difficult to transport and display in our stores. \u00a0And they would suffer from much shorter shelf lives as well.\n I have three big reasons for loving plastic.\u00a0 My number one reason is its ability to keep food fresher for longer, which reduces food waste.\n Secondly, plastic is also effective at retaining nutrients in food.\u00a0 Compared to other packaging materials like glass and metal cans, plastic packaging needs less energy to make and transport, but can be equally effective at retaining nutrients. Frozen vegetables: I\u2019m looking at you.\n My third reason for loving plastic is a little controversial. This sounds crazy, but it\u2019s got to do with the global greenhouse effect. Plastic is an excellent store for carbon.\u00a0 The very same attribute that makes plastic such a long-lived pollutant makes it an effective means of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. Plastic is mostly carbon, and it (mostly) doesn\u2019t biodegrade, which means it isn\u2019t converted back into carbon dioxide when it becomes waste.\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n  Plastic is made almost exclusively from fossil fuels, either from crude oil or natural gas.\u00a0 More specifically, the building blocks of plastics are produced from the naphtha fraction when crude oil is refined, or from the ethane and propane components of natural gas.\n As a result, when we make plastic, we are using carbon from fossil fuels, carbon that \u2013 from a greenhouse effect perspective \u2013 should have been left underground.\n Of course, humans don\u2019t extract fossil fuels just to make plastic.\u00a0 The part of fossil fuels used for olefin plastics \u2013 which are by far the most common type of plastic - are different to the components (\u201cfractions\u201d) we use for other purposes, such as diesel fuel, town gas, heating oil and bitumen. \u00a0So, for as long as we are extracting fossil carbon for those purposes, we have access to a cheap and easy supply of components for plastics.\n Much of the fossil carbon we extract from the ground gets released into the atmosphere when we burn it for fuel; think gasoline, aviation fuel, heating oil and cooking gas.\u00a0 If we are going to extract oil and gas, we may as well turn some of it into stuff that doesn\u2019t get burnt, like plastic.\n Not all plastic ends up in our oceans.\u00a0 While single use plastics create litter and pollution, we also make plastic items that can last a lifetime. Plastic is used in building construction, pipes, cars (16% of an average European car is plastic, by one estimate), carpets and clothing.\u00a0 The longer a piece of plastic remains intact, unburnt, and not bio-degraded, the longer the carbon it contains is locked up and not contributing to the greenhouse effect. In these forms, it is an excellent, stable store of carbon.\n An even better way to store carbon in plastic is to use atmospheric carbon dioxide to manufacture it.\u00a0 We already have the technology to create plastic from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This can be done using biological processes like plants or algae, where photosynthesis is used to extract the carbon dioxide from the air, or by using synthetic processes powered by renewable electricity.\n Right now, these methods are not economically feasible, but that will change when demand for fossil fuels decreases.\u00a0 Less than ten percent of global oil production is used for making plastic, so we should expect higher prices for the plastic-producing fractions of crude oil as oil extraction diminishes. The changing economics of fossil fuel production is going to have a significant impact on the traditional plastic industry.\n Plastic is a major pollutant, but it\u2019s also an overlooked carbon storage solution. We need to capture food packaging plastics before they pollute our oceans or break-down into microplastics.\u00a0 We can capture and bury them in properly designed landfill (not ideal but better than most other options) or recycle them into new items.\u00a0 It\u2019s my fervent hope that in the future virgin plastics will be made using renewable-energy-powered carbon-capture processes.\n  In short: \ud83c\udf4f Plastic makes a great carbon store and helps keep fossil carbon from ending up in our atmosphere: crazy but true! \ud83c\udf4f Also, France banned single use plastic packaging for fruit and veg \ud83c\udf4f\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (I don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)\n Subscribe for free to The Rotten Apple for more like this (we don\u2019t use your email address for anything else, ever)", "posttime": "2022-01-11 12:57:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5851\u6599,plastic", "title": "\u8d5e\u7f8e\u5851\u6599\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5851\u6599\u9002\u5408\u73af\u5883\uff09", "title_en": "In Praise of Plastic (Why Plastic Is Good for the Environment)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://therottenapple.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-plastic", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5851\u6599", "plastic"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0897194e1c3ff9d617dc9092c39013cd.jpg", "infoid": 1072725, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6d77\u8c5a\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u6027\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u590d\u5236\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u56e0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u63d0\u4f9b\u6027\u6109\u60a6\u3002\n\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6d77\u8c5a\u5728\u5357\u8377\u5170\u7701\u5357\u8377\u5170\u7701\u9ea6\u5229\u5965\u65af\u5b66\u9662\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u5e15\u7279\u91cc\u897f\u4e9a\u5e03\u4f26\u5357\uff0c\u74f6\u9888\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u8482\u53ef\u5728\u6027\u4ea4\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e50\u8da3\u3002\n\u50cf\u5973\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u9634\u8482 - \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u6d77\u8c5a - \u4e0e\u96c4\u6027\u751f\u6b96\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u57281998\u5e74\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u9634\u8482\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u516c\u5e03\u3002\n\u4ece\u6d77\u8c5a\u6807\u672c\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6b7b\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6d77\u8c5a\u6807\u672c\uff0cBrennan\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u53d1\u73b0\u6d77\u8c5a\u9634\u830e\u4f53\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u5927\u795e\u7ecf\u4f9b\u5e94\u3002 \u201c\u6240\u4ee5\u5c31\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u201d\n\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u548c\u6210\u4eba\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9634\u8482\u5f62\u72b6\u4e5f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5c11\u5e74\u5973\u6027\u5177\u6709C\u5f62\u9634\u8482\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u751f\u6b96\u6210\u719f\u7684\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u4e14S\u5f62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f62\u72b6Brennan\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u653e\u677e\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6536\u5165\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002 \u201c\u5f53\u90a3\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7528\u8840\u6db2\u586b\u6ee1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u76f4\u5347\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e2d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u53e6\u5916\u4e24\u4e2a\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u4e8e\u5973\u6027\u6d77\u8c5a\u4e2d\u7684\u6269\u5927\u9634\u8482\u3002\u4f9b\u5e94\u9634\u8482\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u4e1b\u96c6\u53ef\u80fd\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u96c4\u6027\u9634\u830e\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7684\u80da\u80ce\u6839\u3002\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u672f\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u6765\u81ea\u76f8\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u9634\u830e\u4e5f\u826f\u597d\u5730\u4f9b\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9634\u8482\u4e5f\u4e0d\u592a\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u3002\n\u5728\u751f\u6b96\u751f\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7269\u79cd\u4e2d\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u5973\u6027\u6027\u6b32\u3002 \u201c\u6d77\u8c5a\u201d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u201c\u5e03\u4f26\u5357\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e1c\u897f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5927\u81ea\u7136\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u3002\u201d\np.l.r.

One reason may be that the prominent female dolphin clitoris provides sexual pleasure.\n A new up-close look at clitoral tissue from common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus) reveals  many similarities to the human clitoris. Abundant sensory nerves and spongy tissues in the genitalia of our female flippered friends suggest the dolphin clitoris may be highly sensitive to physical contact, researchers report January 10 in  Current Biology.\n The findings suggest that the bottlenose dolphin clitoris likely provides pleasure during sex, which adds up since dolphins have sex all the time, says Patricia Brennan, an evolutionary biologist at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.\n Heterosexual and homosexual sex is common in wild dolphins, including female-female sex. \u201cWhat that looks like is females stimulating each other\u2019s clitoris,\u201d with snouts, flippers or flukes, Brennan says. Females also masturbate by rubbing their clitoris against objects on the sea bottom.\n  Like female reproductive anatomy generally, the clitoris \u2014 in many species, not just dolphins \u00a0\u2014 is poorly studied in contrast to male genitalia. The  first rigorous study of clitoral anatomy in humans wasn\u2019t published until 1998.\n During Brennan\u2019s  recent research on dolphin vaginal anatomy, the large size of the common bottlenose dolphin clitoris aroused her curiosity ( SN: 12/15/17). The paucity of prior research prompted Brennan and colleagues to examine the organ and look under the hood \u2014 including under the wrinkled clitoral hood \u2014 an area of enlarged erectile tissue near the vaginal entrance where contact and penile stimulation during copulation is likely.\n Excising the clitorises from dolphin specimens that died of natural causes, Brennan\u2019s team found that the dolphin clitoral body is supplied by abundant large nerves at the skin surface. \u201cSo just like humans,\u201d she says, \u201cthese are areas of high sensitivity.\u201d\n CT scans and dissection also revealed many structural features similar to the human clitoris, though differing in shape and with more spongy tissues. Like in humans, the dolphin clitoris has erectile bodies with dense layers of connective tissue, comprised of collagen and elastin fiber that maintains structural integrity under pressure. The team also found genital corpuscles, encapsulated sensory nerve endings called \u201ccorpuscles of pleasure\u201d in humans.\n Clitoral shape also differs between young and adult dolphins, the researchers report. Juvenile females have a C-shaped clitoris, whereas it is larger and S-shaped in reproductively mature females. These bendy shapes, Brennan predicts, represent a relaxed rather than engorged state. \u201cWhen that tissue fills up with blood, it\u2019s going to straighten up,\u201d she explains.\n These new findings are \u201cstriking but not surprising,\u201d notes Teri Orr, a physiological ecologist at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces who was not involved in this study. Orr, a former postdoc of Brennan, studies genitalia across species. Like bonobos and chimps, she says, dolphin group dynamics involve bonding and pleasure-seeking through sex.\n However, there are at least two other potential hypotheses for the evolution of an enlarged clitoris in female dolphins, Orr says. The thicket of nerves supplying the clitoris may reflect its shared embryological root with the penis in males. During development both arise from the same types of tissues, and the penis is also well-supplied with nerves, so it\u2019s not too surprising that the clitoris is as well.\n Additionally, although modern dolphins do not have ovulation that is induced by an external stimulus, in dolphin ancestors, clitoral stimulation could have played a role in stimulating ovulation, Orr speculates. Across species, theories abound about why female clitoral stimulation can lead to orgasm, and perhaps pleasure and fertility coevolved.\n With a historical and persistent gender bias in reproductive biology research, there is much about female sexuality in all species that we still don\u2019t know.

Car owners get the chance to offset ownership costs, and users get the benefit of affordable short-term rentals at a time when  rental car prices are increasing due to pandemic-induced supply chain issues. Challenges in the traditional car rental industry have certainly allowed Turo to gain some market share, despite steep competition, but that popularity has come with a cost at times, a reading of the risk factors portion of the S-1 shows.\n    Turo generated net revenue of $149.9 million in 2020, a 6% growth from the previous year, according to the S-1. Net losses were $97.1 million in 2020, a slight improvement from the $98.6 million in net losses it had in 2019.\n Turo points to a couple of drivers of its revenue growth, notably a digital tool called the Turo Risk Score. This feature, which launched in April 2020, dynamically adjusts the fees that Turo charges guests to complete a booking. Turo said this tool, along with hosts increasing the prices for vehicles that they charge to guests, contributed to its increased net revenue.\n   Turo says it generated $330.5 million in net revenue in the first nine months of 2021, a whopping 207% increase from $107.8 million for the same period in 2020. Its net losses also expanded as well. Turo reported a net loss of $129.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2020.\n The reason? Turo notes in its S-1 that revenue increased as the number of days booked rose along with gross booking value per day.\n Scanning the S-1, it also appears that Turo tried to do more with less in 2020 and has since turned the financial faucet back on this year. The company tightened its spending in 2020, with operating expenses dropping from $133.9 million in 2019 to $95.8 million in 2020.\n The first nine months of 2021 tell a different story. The company\u2019s operating expenses in the first nine months of the year were $124.01 million compared to $71.6 million during the same period last year.\n  Risk factors facing the company include the obvious \u201cwhat if people don\u2019t use Turo\u201d and \u201cwe face competition\u201d from similar apps and traditional car rental companies. But a few others stick out.\n For one, Turo notes that the COVID-19 pandemic added volatility to its business. The company was forced to lay off staff and even closed its operations in Germany in 2020, only to have the business come roaring back to \u201cabove pre-Covid levels.\u201d\n The car rental app notes it may face liability for criminal activities of its hosts. There don\u2019t appear to be any lawsuits or fines, yet but in August last year,  Turo and other peer-to-peer rental apps were found to have been used by criminals for human trafficking and other crimes, a trend that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection admits is a growing trend near the border.\n Turo is also liable for lawsuits from cities \u2014 or more specifically airport authorities \u2014 that would require the long-time startup to obtain rental car permits. And in this area, Turo has in fact been sued and countersued. There have been four lawsuits regarding airport use and three of them, including one initiated by Turo versus the City of Los Angeles, have yet to be settled.\n  Despite potential risks, Turo estimates its current serviceable addressable market to be $146 billion and its total addressable market to be $230 billion.\n \u201cWe estimate that our $230 billion TAM includes $134 billion in North America, $65 billion in Europe, and $31 billion in the rest of the world (which consists of selected countries in which we believe we have a medium- to long-term opportunity to onboard hosts),\u201d according to the filing.\n Notably, the company appears to be ready to expand its operations within its home U.S. market as well as internationally. It also is ready to make some strategic acquisitions and partnerships \u201cto offer our hosts and guests services and features that we do not currently offer in-house.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:52:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6c7d\u8f66,ipo,\u9762\u4e34", "title": "\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u6c7d\u8f66\u5206\u4eab\u516c\u53f8Turo\u6587\u4ef6IPO\u516c\u5f00", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPeer-to-peer car-sharing company Turo files IPO to go public\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6c7d\u8f66", "ipo", "\u9762\u4e34"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5f7ca654add5665efc98d49cec2cc6a9.jpeg", "infoid": 1072723, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u798f\u7279\uff0cAV\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8ARGO AI\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u6b63\u5728\u4e0eARGO\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u5965\u65af\u6c40\uff0c\u8fc8\u963f\u5bc6\u548c\u534e\u76db\u987f\u5dde\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u5bb6\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8f66\u8f86\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u7684\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u7ec8\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u798f\u7279\uff0c\u90a3\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \uff08ARGO\u8fd8\u62e5\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5339\u5179\u5821\uff0c\u5e95\u7279\u5f8b\u548c\u5e15\u6d1b\u963f\u5c14\u6258\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8230\u961f\u548c\u8bbe\u65bd\uff09\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u8bae\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d1\u5c55\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u901a\u884c\uff0c\u798f\u7279\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u4e94\u5e74\u7684\u8de8\u5ea6\u7a81\u7834\u5f81\u6536\u7a0e\u6536\u4f11\u606f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8be5\u5e02\u8fd8\u5c06\u7b79\u5907250,000\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u5efa\u8bbe\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u65bd\u65e8\u5728\u4f4d\u4e8e2335\u8258\u4f2f\u94f6\u8857\u768432,361\u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u5c3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u8ba8\u4ef7\u8fd8\u4ef7\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u798f\u7279\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8be5\u7269\u4e1a\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u81f3\u5c11250\u9879\u65b0\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c97\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u6295\u8d44\u6700\u4f4e1.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAV\u8230\u961f\u3002\n\u798f\u7279\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8bc4\u8bba\u8fbe\u62c9\u65af\u5e02\u8bae\u4f1a\u7684\u8bae\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u79f0\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u4f55\u989d\u5916\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5e76\u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u5168\u90e8\u521d\u6b65\u201d\u3002", "note_en": "Ford, an investor and customer of AV technology company Argo AI, is working with Argo to commercialize the self-driving technology. The two companies have established three test vehicle depots in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C. in a run up to its commercialization plans. The facility in Dallas, if the location is ultimately chosen by Ford, would be similar to those operations. (Argo also has its own test fleets and facilities in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Palo Alto).\n The two companies plan to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on ride-hailing company Lyft\u2019s app in a number of cities over the next five years, beginning with Miami and Austin.\n  If the agenda item passes with Dallas\u2019s Office of Economic Development, Ford might be looking at over $3 million in proposed tax breaks over the span of five years. The city would also commit a $250,000 grant toward the construction of the facility, which is proposed to be located at a 32,361-square-foot space at 2335 Burbank Street. To meet its end of the bargain, Ford would need to create a minimum of 250 new jobs and invest a minimum of $160 million, including the AV fleet, at the property.\n The Dallas site is one of three final locations that Ford is scouting for its new AV facility,  according to city documents. The other two are in California, where Ford\u2019s AV unit already has a presence. However, Ford might see the benefits of building in Texas, a state that doesn\u2019t require permits to operate driverless autonomous vehicles. California, on the other hand,  requires separate permits for testing with a driver, testing without a driver, commercial autonomous delivery deployment and commercial robotaxi deployment.\n Ford would not comment on the Dallas City Council\u2019s agenda item, saying it has not made any decisions or chosen any additional cities to expand to, and that \u201cthis is all preliminary.\u201d\n \u201cFord is building its self-driving business for ride-hailing and goods delivery in Austin, Texas, Miami and Washington, D.C., and focused on building a profitable self-driving business,\u201d the company told TechCrunch. \u201cScaling this technology is key, driving us to explore a variety of cities in the U.S. to expand our self-driving services.

Existing investors who returned for its latest round include Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, ACV and East Ventures. The new funds will be used for hiring about 400 new employees and scaling KoinWorks\u2019 latest suite of products, SME Neobank.\n KoinWorks is headquartered in Jakarta, with holding in Singapore and tech offices in Yogyakarta, India and Vietnam. KoinWorks was originally created to help SMEs, which are often turned away by traditional financial institutions, get access to working capital. Since then, it has also developed a comprehensive platform of financial tools to help its customers, including e-commerce vendors and social commerce sellers, increase their sales.\n  TechCrunch  first profiled KoinWorks in 2019 when it raised $12 million for its lending platform. Demand increased as more businesses went online during the COVID-19 pandemic and the startup says its user base tripled to 1.5 million customers, and a waitlist of 100,000 SMEs who are being onboarded onto its new financial software. Co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin told TechCrunch in an email that since 2019, monthly loan disbursements have also tripled to nearly $50 million and revenue had quadrupled.\n KoinWorks focuses on SMEs that are underserved by traditional financial institutions and may not have a bank account or credit cards. On the platform, users can create an online bank account and card, borrow working capital, and access accounting, point-of-sale, early wage access and human resources management systems tailored for small businesses.\n Arifin said that since KoinWorks\u2019 monthly disbursement rate reached $50 million a month, its take rate has grown enough that the company became cash flow positive earlier this year, and its non-performing loan (NPL) percentage is lower than 2%. He says banks serving traditional SMEs have at least double KoinWorks\u2019 NPL. \u201cAs many as 20% of businesses shifted their sales channels offline to online during the pandemic, and 89% of businesses now use online channels to sell their products and services,\u201d he said.\n Over the last three years, KoinWorks\u2019 competitors have grown to include other neobanks and startups that started out as accounting software but are expanding to include working capital loans and other financial services. Two notable examples included rivals BukuWarung and BukuKas, both of which have raised significant rounds of funding.\n   \u201cWhen we started out, we were among hundreds of traditional financial institutions. Fast forward to the present day, we are seeing those same banks now undergo digitalization,\u201d Arifin said. \u201cDespite that, Indonesia\u2019s yearly funding gap is $80 billion USD, so those who remain unbanked or underbanked are still at a disadvantage. There\u2019s still a lot of room for improvement\u201d\n He added that with tens of millions of entrepreneurs in Indonesia, \u201cit\u2019s not a winner-takes-all market.\u201d The top five banks in the country have a combined market value of close to $160 billion USD. There will undoubtedly be fintech companies out there tackling the unbanked/underbanked space, however, KoinWorks has a best in class approach tailored to the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs that we believe will have a significant impact on the future sector.\n  In a statement, MDI Ventures CEO Donald Wiharia said, \u201cInvesting in KoinWorks is investing in the financial literacy of underbanked and underserved communities. We are ecstatic to be in concert with a team that understands the importance of each step in the journey of entrepreneurship and SME growth.\u201c", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:50:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a,koinworks", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u52a0\u8fbe\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u5e73\u53f0Koinworks Scoops US $ 108M\u7cfb\u5217C.", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tJakarta-based SME financial platform KoinWorks scoops up $108M Series C\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/jakarta-based-sme-financial-platform-koinworks-scoops-up-108m-series-c/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a", "koinworks"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "53131827bf467c4d7f4653c6ef95644b.jpg", "infoid": 1072721, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "1967\u5e746\u6708\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aCES\u6d3b\u52a8\u5438\u5f15\u4e8617,500\u540d\u4e0e\u4f1a\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7fa4\u88abGE\u7684\u65b0\u6b3e24\u78c5\u5f69\u8272\u7535\u89c6\u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71\u3002\u5728\u4ecb\u5165\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u589e\u957f\u5982\u6b64\u4e4b\u591a\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005\uff0c2020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4f4d\u57282020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86171,268\u4eba\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u62c9\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u5ba1\u67e5\u671f\u520a\uff0c\u53ea\u670940,000\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u662f75\uff05\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n\u57282014\u5e74\u5de6\u53f3\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u5de6\u53f3\uff0cCES\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u8f66\u5c55\u3002\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u4eba\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u5931\u53bb\u6c7d\u8f66\u5149\u6cfd\u7684CES 2022\u3002\n\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u5e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8f66\u8f86\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u516c\u544a\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u4eba\u5305\u62ecLas Vegas Speedway\u7684\u5934\u8111\u524d\u5f80\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d5b\u9a6c\u573a\uff0cGM\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Mary Barra\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u51fa\u552e\u4e2a\u4eba\u81ea\u6cbb\u8f66\u8f86\uff08\u867d\u7136\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u548c\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7ed9\u4e58\u7528\u8f66\uff0c\u5361\u8f66\u548cSUV\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6743\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a7e\u9a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u51fa\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u672a\u6765\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u72ed\u9698\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u505c\u8f66\u573a - \u6216\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u516c\u544a\u6307\u5411CES 2022\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "note_en": "The first CES event in June 1967 drew 17,500 attendees, where many in the crowd were absolutely dazzled by GE\u2019s new 24-pound color television. In the intervening decades, the conference grew so much, it essentially created its own gravity. The last in-person CES held in 2020 attracted a total verified attendance of 171,268, according to organizers.\n The trade show shifted to online-only in 2021, but CES returned last week, even though many exhibitors and publications (including this one) declined to send representatives, citing the ongoing omicron surge. \u201cIt\u2019s time we return to making the world better rather than living in fear,\u201d wrote Consumer Trade Association president and CEO Gary Shapiro  in an opinion column.\n But just 40,000 people attended,  according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. That\u2019s a 75% decline.\n If an event only attracts 25% of its usual crowd, for whom is it essential? Today, TechCrunch Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec, Hardware Editor Brian Heater and reporter Haje Jan Kamps shared their thoughts on CES 2022:\n    Somewhere around 2014 or so, CES turned into a car show. And even with the latest variant of COVID derailing in-person plans for many companies, CES 2022 didn\u2019t lose its automotive luster.\n This year was different in a few respects, signaling that the automotive industry has taken a few cupfuls of we-really-need-revenue punch. Technology that is further away from commercialization showed up, but not in the same force as in previous years. CES 2022 was not the year for evtols, hyperloop, and to a lesser degree, autonomous vehicle technology.\n  Autonomous vehicle technology wasn\u2019t absent from the show, and there were some key announcements and activities. A few of the notable ones included the head-to-head autonomous racecar competition at the Las Vegas Speedway, GM CEO Mary Barra\u2019s intention to  sell personal autonomous vehicles\u00a0by mid-decade (although some key details were missing) and Intel subsidiary Mobileye\u2019s plan to bring a new\u00a0 supercomputer to market\u00a0designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\u00a0When automated driving did come up, it was often in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking \u2014 or both.The Mobileye announcement points to one of the themes at CES 2022: compute.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:49:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "In fact, silly as it sounds, try being  more worried about it than seems normal. After all, for-profit biometric data collection has undergone an astounding degree of normalization in the last decade. The idea of Apple scanning your fingerprint on a daily basis once sounded startling. Now it\u2019s how we unlock our banking app and our laptop \u2014 unless, of course, we do it with our face. It\u2019s gone mainstream.\n We embraced FaceID, thumbprint scanning and similar functions specifically because they are convenient. No passcode, no problem.\n  Corporations and businesses saw this, and now convenience is among the two biggest reasons typically given for the adoption of biometric data collection \u2013 the other is public safety, which we\u2019ll get to later. Quick biometric scans, we\u2019re told, make things faster and easier.\n In a bid to save time, a number of primary schools throughout the U.K. recently  implemented facial scanning for lunch payment. Several schools ended up suspending the program after data privacy experts and parents  pushed back. They argued convenience was not exactly worth the price of the accumulation of an entire database of young children\u2019s faces stored on a server somewhere. And they\u2019re right.\n  This September, U.S. ticketing company AXS announced a flagship program to use Amazon One palm-print scanners at Red Rocks Amphitheater as an optional alternative to print or mobile concert tickets ( with plans to expand into additional venues in the coming months). The decision was met with  immediate resistance from both privacy experts and musicians, and it was hardly the first flashpoint over biometric data collection within the live music industry.\n In 2019, major promoters LiveNation and AEG (which coordinates major festivals such as Coachella)  stepped back from plans to invest in and implement facial recognition technology at concerts after public outcry from fans and artists.\n  But the fight over the use of biometric recognition during live entertainment is far from settled. When the coronavirus pandemic sent professional sports executives who depend on full stadiums back to the drawing board, their new plans often incorporated mass facial recognition. Faces would replace tickets, and this would ostensibly make everyone safer from the virus.\n These executives are determined. The Dutch football team AFC Ajax is seeking to reinstall its pilot facial recognition program that was initially halted by data protection regulators. Henk van Raan, the chief innovation officer of Ajax\u2019s home field, Amsterdam ArenA, was  quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying, \u201cHopefully we use this coronavirus pandemic to change rules. The coronavirus is a bigger enemy than [any threat to] privacy.\u201d\n This is terrible reasoning, as the risks posed to our privacy are in no way mitigated or lessened by our risk to a virus.\n In the same article, Shaun Moore, CEO of facial-recognition supplier Trueface, described his conversations with professional sports executives as overwhelmingly concerned with touch points by sidestepping the handing over of credentials, citing the risk of virus transmission while scanning ticket barcodes.\n This is a stretch, and you don\u2019t need to be an epidemiologist to call it one. When the main event involves a big crowd of people yelling and cheering next to one another, it\u2019s probably not the momentary masked interaction when an agent scans a ticket that is worth worrying about. As the safety argument falls apart, so does the convenience one. The simple fact is that our lives are not made exponentially and meaningfully better by the replacement of a mobile ticket with our palm print. Those extra five seconds are a moot point.\n It\u2019s interesting to see van Raan speak so directly about using the pandemic to override privacy protections and concerns. But his reasoning is frightening and flawed.\n Yes, the coronavirus is a real threat, but it\u2019s not an \u201cenemy.\u201d It\u2019s not embodied, nor does it have a motive. It\u2019s a virus. It is outside human control. In insurance terms, it\u2019s an \u201cact of God.\u201d And it\u2019s being used to justify something that is very much in human control: The huge uptick in biometric data collection under the guise of public safety or convenience.\n  Public safety is often the cause upon which increased biometric surveillance is foisted. In August, U.S. lawmakers  introduced a mandate that would require auto manufactures to include passive technology in new cars to prevent drunken drivers from starting vehicles. That \u201cpassive\u201d tech could end up being anything from eye-scanning devices and breathalyzers to an infrared sensor that tests BAC levels through the skin.\n Sure, this is a seemingly noble cause with a respectable motive. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drunken driving kills nearly 10,000 people per year; the European Commission  lists a similar number for the EU.\n But where is all that data going? Where is it being stored? Who is it being sold to, and what do they plan to do with it? The privacy risks are too great.\n The pandemic obliterated many of the obstacles standing in the way of the adoption of mass biometric data collection, and the consequences will be disastrous for civil liberties if it\u2019s allowed to continue in this manner. The intensity of surveillance is ramping up in record time, making governments and for-profit corporations privy to that most private minutiae of our lives and bodies.\n A mobile ticket is surveillance enough \u2013 it announces to the system you\u2019ve entered the venue at an exact time, after all. Don\u2019t fix it if it\u2019s not broken! And don\u2019t add biometric data collection just because you can under the shaky guise of not spreading germs.\n Give out as little biometric data as possible, period. It\u2019s not enough to avoid giving your biometric data to Google or Amazon specifically, given those corporations\u2019 abysmal records when it comes to, say, basic human rights and civil liberties.\n A smaller company unaffiliated with your typical tech giant might feel like less of a threat, but don\u2019t be fooled. The moment Amazon or Google acquires that company, they acquire your and everyone else\u2019s biometric data with it. And we\u2019re back where we started.\n A safe society need not be a heavily surveilled society. We built increasingly safe and healthy societies for centuries without the use of a single video camera. And beyond safety, heavy surveillance that is this detailed and individualized is the death knell of a society that values civil liberties.\n Maybe that\u2019s what this all comes down to.

If protein isolates are produced in the correct way, so to be safe, they could be considered as human food in the future.\u201d\n \u201cThe whole point about gorse is it is actively being removed from marginal lands \u2013 it\u2019s something we can gain protein from at no extra cost,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a huge amount of gorse all over  Scotland and when we did the calculations, just by active removal from marginal land, there\u2019s enough gorse protein to easily feed [Scotland\u2019s] population.\u201d\n Russell was speaking at a Science Media Centre event on alternative proteins which looked at the health and environmental benefits and drawbacks of alternatives to meat and dairy. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a  polling report at the event that showed 60% of people in the UK were willing to try plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy; a third were willing to try lab-grown meat and a quarter were willing to try edible insects.\n Livestock and fodder production occupies  83% of the world\u2019s farmland but produces only 18% of protein. It also has a very heavy environmental impact, driving the climate crisis and pollution. Studies have shown  sharp cuts in meat eating in rich nations are needed to halt global heating.\n From 1950 to 2000 the global population doubled, but meat intake increased fivefold, said Russell. Continuing this trend in the future is not feasible for the environment, she said: \u201cWe really do have to change our diet.\u201d\n Scotland has little arable land, which is why Russell examined invasive plants on marginal land. \u201cWhen you make a protein isolate from gorse, 57% of the total leaf protein can be recovered at up to 95% purity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re using about 4.5 to 6kg of CO 2 to produce [a kilogram of] isolate, compared to an average for meat of 102kg of CO 2.\u201d\n Fifteen Scottish farmers also planted hemp this year for the first time, Russell said. \u201cThey\u2019re really concerned about the climate and want to do their best. They really are optimistic about the commercial viability of the crop and its climate credentials.\u201d\n Russell, who leads the Scottish government\u2019s strategic research programme on food systems and supply, added: \u201cThese alternative plant proteins are very healthy, high protein, high in fibre, and high in micronutrients.\u201d\n Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA said: \u201cThere is a huge potential for novel proteins to have massive benefits in terms of environmental benefit, nutritional benefit, and access of a wider population [to good food]. Our priority is to do everything possible to help businesses get those novel, innovative products safely onto the shelves as swiftly as possible.\u201d\n May said that while many people were reluctant to try new products, such as lab-grown meat, a quarter said they would change their minds if they were confident it was safe and well regulated. \u201cThat\u2019s where we play a key role,\u201d said May.\n Lab-grown meat went on sale for the first time in December 2020 in Singapore. Proponents say they are produced in clean facilities and do not carry the risk of bacterial contamination of meat from livestock.\n In the FSA poll, 90% of people said they had heard of plant-based alternatives and 78% said they had heard of lab grown meat.\n Neil Shah, at the Edison Group investment research firm, which published a report on lab-grown meat on Monday, said: \u201cThe cultivated meat industry is booming as a result of increased appetite for ethical and environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional meat. The sector has already begun attracting significant investor interest as it offers the chance to enter an industry which could disrupt the global meat market over the coming decades.\u201d\n A 2019 report by consultancy AT Kearney predicted that  most of the meat people eat in 2040 will not come from slaughtered animals.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:42:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28,gorse", "title": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bf4\uff0c\u6765\u81eaGorse\u704c\u6728\u4e1b\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u517b\u6d3b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba", "title_en": "Protein From Gorse Bushes Could Feed Millions of People, Says Expert", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/protein-from-gorse-bushes-could-feed-millions-of-people-says-expert", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u86cb\u767d\u8d28", "gorse"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e91f8f8fffce6f53f110d2ad66ac2980.jpg", "infoid": 1072718, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u661f\u671f\u516d\uff0cAndroid Boss Hiroshi Lockheimer\u6307\u8d23Apple\u7684\u201c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6b3a\u51cc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9500\u552e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u201d\uff0c\u5728\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5982\u4f55\u5c06Apple\u7684Imessage\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9501\u5b9aAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42Apple\u5728Android\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de8\u578b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42Apple\u652f\u6301IMESSage\u4e2d\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff08RCS\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u652f\u6301\u65e7\u7684SMS / MMS\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\u201c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5305\u542bRCS\uff0cApple\u6b63\u5728\u963b\u6b62\u884c\u4e1a\u5e76\u904f\u5236\u200b\u200b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd8\u6301\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u201d\u5728Twitter\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7a0d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u6d1b\u514b\u6d77\u9ed8\u3002\n\u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u524d\u9762\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eApple\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u611f\u8c22epic v\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u5ba1\u5224\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u5bc6\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u6545\u610f\u6263\u7559IMessage\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9501\u5b9a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u62c5\u5fc3Android\u4e0a\u7684IMESSage\u5c06\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5220\u9664\u4e00\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\u7684iPhone\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ed9\u5b69\u5b50Android\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u201dApple Exec Craig Federighi\u4e8e2013\u5e744\u6708\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u201c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5ba2\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56Apple\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002 \u3002\u201c\n\u66f4\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u77ed\u4fe1\u662frcs\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7eb3\u5165imessage\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9Apple\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8c37\u6b4c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u51fb\u538b\u529b\u3002\n\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u8bb8\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u80ae\u810f\u6d17\u8863\u623f\uff08\u4ee5\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u88ab\u64ad\u51fa\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u9762\u524d\uff0c\u5176\u5458\u5de5\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u50cfWSJ\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u788e\u7247\u662f\u51fa\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8482\u59c6\u53a8\u5e08\u53ef\u80fd\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6269\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8102\u80aa\u5305\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1......\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4e3aAndroid\u5e26\u6765\u4e86IMessage\u6216\u8005\u5bf9imessage\u7684rcs\u662f\u82f9\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u5c0f\u7279\u8bb8\u6743\u3002", "note_en": "On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer  accused Apple of \u201cusing peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products,\u201d after  a  Wall Street Journal report revealed how US teens have turned Apple\u2019s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out.\n Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive  said Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\u201d\n We\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\n\u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer)  January 10, 2022\n \u201cBy not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\u201d  adds Lockheimer, later in the Twitter thread.\n That\u2019s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple  accept Google\u2019s olive branch to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones?\n On the lock-in front, there\u2019s little question about Apple\u2019s motivation. Thanks to the  Epic v. Apple trial,  the world has now seen confidential emails between Apple executives that show the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. \u201cI am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,\u201d  wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013, adding \u201cI think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.\u201d\n \u201cJoz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,\u201d  wrote Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller in March 2016, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he \u201cmissed a ton of messages from friends and family\u201d after switching to an Android phone.\n What\u2019s less clear is whether RCS,  the next-gen replacement for SMS that\u2019s championed by Google and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That\u2019s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.\n  The Verge has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS  literally years with no comment, so we\u2019re not holding our breath. We\u2019ve also made  the moral case that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we\u2019ve written about  the personal plight of dealing with Apple\u2019s inaction. (And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I\u2019m writing this post because he\u2019s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren\u2019t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)\n But maybe now that Apple  is basically a three-trillion dollar company, and it\u2019s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and  its employees are speaking out, and pieces like the  WSJ\u2019s are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy  larger than simply scaling up the company to become the most valuable in the world with  a fat pay package as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make.\n Correction, 7:48PM ET : Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was \u201cNo comment.\u201d I regret the error.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:19:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,android,lead", "title": "Android Lead Hiroshi Lockheimer\u8868\u793a\uff0cApple\u662f\u201c\u963b\u6b62\u201d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0d\u652f\u6301IMessage\u4e2d\u7684RCS", "title_en": "Android lead Hiroshi Lockheimer says Apple is \u201cholding back\u201d the messaging experience for not just Android but its own users by not supporting RCS in iMessage", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877304/google-lockheimer-accuse-apple-imessage-holding-back-rcs-text-sms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "android", "lead"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072716, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "CREV\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002 CREV  - \u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67097\u4e2a\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002\u5728github\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "note_en": "Repositories for the crev project. crev - Code REView system has 7 repositories available.
