Chipotherm has been running for over a year now at the arcade, and it\u2019s still working great! Armed with enthusiasm for my DIY smart thermostat, and having just moved into a new house that came with a  Ring doorbell, I thought I might try building my own DIY doorbell to replace it.\n My motivations for this project were beyond just wanting to build something new and fun. The Ring Doorbell, which is now owned by advertising megacorp Amazon, suffers from all of the same privacy problems described in my post about the Nest thermostat, but even worse. Like the Nest thermostat, the client software is a total \u201crace to the bottom\u201d one-size-fits-all garbage iOS app that not only looks bad, but is full of bugs. Also like the Nest, all of your data is hosted in \u201cthe cloud\u201d, and a monthly ransom is required before you (\u201cthe customer\u201d) are actually allowed to access it. Worse than the Nest, however, is the fact that the Ring doorbell actually has a camera and microphone built-in, so video and audio feeds are also held for ransom in \u201cthe cloud\u201d, and are shared with any interested party, sometimes even  without your permission.\n Just like many other Internet of Things products, the Ring has also been subject to multiple disastrous  data breaches, meaning besides law enforcement agencies and advertising partners, many Ring customers\u2019 private data is now also in the hands of malicious hackers, who may in the future offer ransoms that are much harder to refuse than the one offered by Amazon. This article from  Ars Technica seems to indicate that the problem is also about to get much worse, with automatic license plate detection in the works and more police partnerships.\n In today\u2019s world of corporate surveillance, building your own DIY smart appliances is a true superpower\u2014and a lot of fun too! I originally planned to just have a simple button, perhaps attached to an  ESP8266, which is a wonderful new WiFi microcontroller that\u2019s becoming extremely popular these days with home automation enthusiasts. The project quickly grew in scope as I decided to also add a cool LED and a camera (whose feed is hosted entirely  on-prem).\n  For the hardware, the first thing that comes to mind is obviously the button. I decided to buy a cool \u201cengine starter\u201d  automotive button   1 first, and design the rest of the doorbell around that. The LED around button is powered via 12vDC as well, so if I wanted to be able to control it via software, I\u2019ll also need to get a MOSFET and build a small circuit.\n  To control everything, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi Zero, since it has ample GPIO pins for detecting the switch press, a PWM pin for modulating the LED inside of the button, and a special camera bus. The Raspberry Pi Zero\u2019s super small size also meant I can probably fit it inside of pretty much anything, and it was very unlikely to demand very much power or cooling resources.\n As for wiring, fortunately the previous owner of my homestead had already wired the front gate (where this was to be installed) with Ethernet, presumably for some kind of call box or security system. This meant that using Power-Over-Ethernet (PoE), I could run both power and networking from the garage where my router/server was located to the gate where the doorbell was to be installed. This required a basic PoE splitter/receiver, and an Ethernet adapter for the Raspberry Pi Zero (since it doesn\u2019t have onboard Ethernet like the full-size Raspberry Pi does).\n Lastly, the case to put everything in. I thought this would be easy to 3D print, since it\u2019s just an enclosure with a hole in the front and in the back, but it turned out to be rather difficult to build. The 3D printer in my possession, a first generation Makerbot Replicator, wasn\u2019t able to print parts that fit together nicely. The end result was three separate plastic pieces that didn\u2019t fit together well and ended up being really flimsy.\n  A friend of mine had a much more expensive Stereo-lithography 3D printer, so I had him try and print the same design I originally came up with. This resulted in a much more accurate print, with pieces that fit together really nicely. However, perhaps due to the type of resin that was used, also ended up being extremely flimsy.\n   I ended up buying a really great  injection molded enclosure from Digikey for about $9. It ended up being really easy just drilling holes in a mass-produced enclosure instead of 3D printing a custom design. The quality is also far better than any of my prints.\n       In order to replicate the most important part of the functionality of the Ring, there will need to be some software running on the Raspberry Pi that polls for button presses, which then contacts some computer on my network to notify me about doorbell events. I call these \u201cdings\u201d   2. Just recently, I had learned about this great protocol admired by DIY IoT enthusiasts called  MQTT, or The Message Queuing and Telemetry Transport protocol. The gist of it is that it\u2019s a PubSub (publisher-subscriber) protocol for any kind of message. It\u2019s kind of like  NSNotificationCenter, but for your local network. There are topics and messages, and that\u2019s about it. Topics are usually in the format of  domain/subdomain/topic, but it can really be anything you want, as long as it\u2019s consistent in your implementations.\n In the case of my doorbell, the topic I chose is  doorbell/ding for ding events. The button is physically connected to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi, so there\u2019s a bit of code that polls for this pin to go high, and when it does, a message is published to the  doorbell/ding topic over MQTT.\n Now that the doorbell itself is notifying my network about ding events, I just need something on the other end that  subscribes to these events and notifies me somehow. Just recently, I had set up a small GNU/Linux PC and a receiver connected to the speakers in my living room as an  MPD server for playing music. Getting this computer to play a doorbell sound whenever a message was posted to the ding MQTT topic was extremely easy! All I had to do was write a small shell script that runs in a loop.\n  All this shell script does is use  mosquitto_sub to subscribe to the  doorbell/ding topic on  hassio.nor (that\u2019s my MQTT server, only accessible on my LAN) and play  doorbell.wav whenever a message is sent to that topic. The  -C 1 option says to wait for one message, then exit. This is executed in a loop forever. So far this has been working great. I really love the simplicity of MQTT.\n  Since I run  Kodi Media Center on my TV, it was also extremely easy to get these notifications to show up on my TV!\n The next thing I had to do was figure out some way to notify my iPhone about ding events as well, in case someone rings my doorbell while I\u2019m away from home. I thought this might be really difficult, since in order to do push notifications, I\u2019d probably have to write an iOS app, and also run a server to sign and publish to Apple\u2019s Push Notification service, and a bunch of other hooey. Fortunately, I had recently set up a  Home Assistant server at home for some other projects I was working on. The Home Assistant iOS app supports push notifications, which can be used in automations triggered by MQTT events. All I had to do was set up an automation in Home Assistant that subscribes to the  doorbell/ding topic, and when a message a published on that topic, Home Assistant will call its own \u201cnotify\u201d service to push the notification to my phone (and do any number of other things). The seemingly infinite number of ways to extend and hack Home Assistant is the reason why I love using it so much for DIY IoT projects. All in all, I ended up writing  no code for the server-side of this project, which is pretty neat.\n  The most important part of this project for me was getting the button to notify me about doorbell dings in a way that\u2019s entirely controlled by me, and runs only on my local network. Secondarily, I did think it would be nice to have a camera attached to it as well so I can see  who is at the door before going outside to greet them. Again, since all of this is local and controlled by me, I had very little privacy concerns about adding a camera.\n The fisheye camera I had bought for the Raspberry Pi was pretty good, but it\u2019s actually missing an infrared filter on the front, so all of the images have a really purple-ish tint to them. While not very aesthetically pleasing, it does at least get the job done, and for a very low cost. Apparently this is one of the most expensive parts on a commercial-grade security camera, many of which have a mechanical IR filter that can move out of the way of the sensor at nighttime for an optimal picture in low light scenarios in addition to working well in the daylight.\n  A live camera feed is accessible via the Home Assistant interface, or I can subscribe to another MQTT topic where photos of people who pressed the doorbell are posted to. The Raspberry Pi acquires these images from the camera via a Video4Linux abstraction layer that\u2019s pretty easy to use in my program. The frames are then currently encoded as JPEGs and posted to MQTT. In the near future, I would like to have the Raspberry Pi encode a RTSP stream instead, since the Pi has a video core in its SOC specifically designed to encode video, so it would use very little power/resources.\n   Above is the final product, drilled, screwed, and installed onto the gate in front of my house. The LED ring is not really that noticeable during the daytime, but trust me, it\u2019s very bright at night! It does a cool pulsing effect when idle, and blinks when pressed to acknowledge the press and to notify the visitor that someone is coming.\n Since I have complete control over the hardware, there\u2019s a lot more fun stuff I can do with this in the future. Some ideas I had were automatic face detection (in a privacy-centric on-prem way, of course), secret button codes to do things, and maybe even a built-in microphone and speaker so I could have a conversation with the visitor. Unfortunately that box is  quite cramped as it is! At least the software is really easy to change.\n Speaking of software, the code for the doorbell is free and open-source. You can find it on my  SourceHut page.\n  Yes, I\u2019m aware of the cognitive dissonance around dissing Ring/Amazon and ordering parts from Amazon.

", "note_en": "Tiger got to hunt, Bird got to fly; Lisper got to sit and wonder, (Y (Y Y))?  Tiger got to sleep, Bird got to land; Lisper got to tell himself he understand.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 Kurt Vonnegut, modified by Darius Bacon\n  I recently wrote a blog post about the Y combinator. Since then, I&#39;ve received so many useful comments that I thought it was appropriate to expand the post into a more complete article. This article will go into greater depth on the subject, but I hope it&#39;ll be more comprehensible as well. You don&#39;t need to have read the previous post to understand this one (in fact, it&#39;s probably better if you haven&#39;t.) The only background knowledge I require is a tiny knowledge of the Scheme programming language including recursion and first-class functions, which I will review. Comments are (again) welcome.\n   Before I get into the details of what Y actually is, I&#39;d like to addressthe question of why you, as a programmer, should bother to learn about it. Tobe honest, there aren&#39;t a lot of good nuts-and-bolts practical reasons forlearning about Y. Even though it does have a few practical applications, forthe most part it&#39;s mainly of interest to computer language theorists.Nevertheless, I do think it&#39;s worth your while to know something about Y forthe following reasons:\n It&#39;s one of the most beautiful ideas in all of programming. If you have any sense of programming aesthetics, you&#39;re sure to be delighted by Y.\n It shows in a very stark way how amazingly powerful the simple ideas of functional programming are.\n In 1959, the British scientist C. P. Snow gave a famous lecture called  The Two Cultures where he bemoaned the fact that many intelligent and well-educated people of the time had almost no knowledge of science. He used knowledge of the Second Law of Thermodynamics as a kind of dividing line between those who were scientifically literate and those who weren&#39;t. I think we can similarly use knowledge of the Y combinator as a dividing line between programmers who are &#34;functionally literate&#34; ( i.e. have a reasonably deep knowledge of functional programming) and those who aren&#39;t. There are other topics that could serve just as well as Y (notably monads), but Y will do nicely. So if you aspire to have the True Lambda-Nature, read on.\n By the way,  Paul Graham (the Lisp hacker, Lisp book author, essayist, and now venture capitalist) apparently thinks so highly of Y that he named his startup incubator company  Y Combinator. Paul got rich from his knowledge of ideas like these; maybe someone else will too. Maybe even you.\n    We&#39;ll start our exploration of the Y combinator by defining some functions to compute factorials. The factorial of a non-negative integer  n is the product of all integers starting from  1 and going up to and including  n. Thus we have:\n factorial 1 = 1 factorial 2 = 2 * 1 = 2 factorial 3 = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 factorial 4 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24\n and so on. (I&#39;m using a function notation without parentheses here, so\u00a0 factorial 3\u00a0 is the same as what is usually written as\u00a0 factorial(3).\u00a0 Humor me.) Factorials increase veryrapidly with increasing  n; the factorial of  20 is 2432902008176640000. The factorial of  0 is definedto be  1; this turns out to be the appropriate definition for the kinds of things factorials are actually used for (like solving problems incombinatorics).\n  It&#39;s easy to write a function in a programming language to compute factorials using some kind of a looping control construct like a  while or  for loop ( e.g. in C or Java). However, it&#39;s also easy to write a recursive function to compute factorials, because factorials have a very natural recursive definition:\n  where the second line applies for all  n greater than zero. Infact, in the computer language  Haskell,that&#39;s the way you actually define the factorial function. In  Scheme, the language we&#39;ll be using here,this function would be written like this:\n  Scheme uses a parenthesized prefix notation for everything, so something like  \u00a0(- n 1)\u00a0 represents what is usually written  \u00a0n - 1\u00a0 in most programming languages. The reasons for this are beyond the scope of this article, but getting used to this notation isn&#39;t very hard.\n In fact, the above definition of the factorial function in Scheme could also be written in a slightly more explicit way as follows:\n (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))\n The keyword  lambda simply indicates that the thing we&#39;redefining ( i.e. whatever is enclosed by the open parenthesis to theimmediate left of the  lambda and its corresponding closeparenthesis) is a function. What comes immediately after the word lambda, in parentheses, are the  formal arguments of thefunction; here there is just one argument, which is  n. The body of the function comes after the formal arguments, and hereconsists of the expression  (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n1)))). This kind of function is an  anonymous function. Here youdo give the anonymous function the name  factorial after you&#39;vedefined it, but you don&#39;t have to, and often it&#39;s handy not to if you&#39;re onlygoing to be using it once. In Scheme and some other languages, anonymousfunctions are also called  lambda expressions. Many programminglanguages besides Scheme allow you to define anonymous functions, includingPython, Ruby, Javascript, Ocaml, and Haskell (but not C, C++, or Java,unfortunately). We&#39;ll be using lambda expressions a lot below.\n In the Scheme language, the definition of  factorial just givenis identical to the one before it; Scheme simply translates the firstdefinition into the second one before evaluating it. So all functions inScheme are really lambda expressions.\n Note that the body of the function has a call to the  factorialfunction (which we&#39;re in the process of defining) inside it, which makes thisa recursive definition. I will call this kind of definition, where the name ofthe function being defined is used in the body of the function, an explicitly recursive definition. (You might wonder what an &#34;implicitlyrecursive&#34; function would be. I&#39;m not going to use that expression, but thenotion I have in mind is a recursive function which is generated throughnon-recursive means \u2014 keep reading!)\n For the sake of argument, we&#39;re going to assume that our version of Schemedoesn&#39;t have the equivalent of  for or  while loops inC or Java (although in fact, real Scheme implementations do have suchconstructs, but under a different name), so that in order to define a functionlike  factorial, we pretty much have to use recursion. Scheme isoften used as a teaching language partly for this reason: it forces studentsto learn to think recursively.\n  Scheme is a cool language for many reasons, but one that is relevant to ushere is that it allows you to use functions as &#34;first class&#34; data objects(this is often expressed by saying that Scheme supports  first-classfunctions). This means that in Scheme, we can pass a function to anotherfunction as an argument, we can return a function as the result of evaluatinganother function applied to its arguments, and we can create functionson-the-fly as we need them (using the  lambda notation shownabove). This is the essence of functional programming, and it will featureprominently in the ensuing discussion. Functions which take other functions asarguments, and/or which return other functions as their results, are usuallyreferred to as  higher-order functions.\n  Now, here&#39;s the puzzle: what if you were asked to define the factorial function in Scheme, but were told that you could notuse recursive function calls in the definition (for instance, in the factorial function given above you cannot use the word factorial anywhere in the body of the function). However, you are allowed to use first-class functions and higher-order functions anyway you see fit. With this knowledge, can you define the factorial function?\n The answer to this question is yes, and it will lead us directly to the Ycombinator.\n   The Y combinator is a higher-order function. It takes a single argument,which is a function that isn&#39;t recursive. It returns a version of the functionwhich is recursive. We will walk through this process of generating recursivefunctions from non-recursive ones using Y in great detail below, but that&#39;sthe basic idea.\n More generally, Y gives us a way to get recursion in a programming languagethat supports first-class functions but that doesn&#39;t have recursion built into it. So what Y shows us is that such a language already allows us to definerecursive functions, even though the language definition itself says nothingabout recursion. This is a Beautiful Thing: it shows us that functionalprogramming alone can allow us to do things that we would never expect to beable to do (and it&#39;s not the only example of this).\n  We will be looking at two broad classes of computer languages: those that use  lazy evaluation and those that use  strict evaluation. Lazyevaluation means that in order to evaluate an expression in the language, youonly evaluate as much of the expression as is needed to get the final result.So (for instance) if there is a part of the expression that doesn&#39;t need toget evaluated (because the result will not depend on it) it won&#39;t beevaluated. In contrast, strict evaluation means that all parts of anevaluation will be evaluated completely before the value of the expression asa whole is determined (with some necessary exceptions, such as if expressions, which have to be lazy to work properly). Inpractice, lazy evaluation is more general, but strict evaluation is morepredictable and often more efficient. Most programming languages use strictevaluation. The programming language  Haskell uses lazy evaluation, and this isone of the most interesting things about that language. We will use both kindsof evaluation in what follows.\n  Even though we often refer to Y as &#34;the&#34; Y combinator, in actual fact thereare an infinite number of Y combinators. We will only be concerned with two ofthese, one lazy and one strict. We need two Y combinators because the Ycombinator we define for lazy languages will not work for strict languages.The lazy Y combinator is often referred to as the  normal-order Ycombinator and the strict one is referred to as the  applicative-order Ycombinator. Basically,  normal-order is another way of saying &#34;lazy&#34;and  applicative-order is another way of saying &#34;strict&#34;.\n  Another big dividing line in programming languages is between  statictyping and  dynamic typing. A statically-typed language is one wherethe types of all expressions are determined at compile time, and any typeerrors cause the compilation to fail. A dynamically-typed language doesn&#39;t doany type checking until run time, and if a function is applied to arguments ofinvalid types ( e.g. by trying to add together an integer and a string),then an error is reported. Among commonly-used programming languages, C, C++and Java are statically typed, and Perl, Python and Ruby are dynamicallytyped. Scheme (the language we&#39;ll be using for our examples) is alsodynamically typed. (There are also languages that straddle the border betweenstatically-typed and dynamically-typed, but I won&#39;t discuss thisfurther.)\n One often hears static typing referred to as  strong typing anddynamic typing referred to as  weak typing, but this is an abuse ofterminology. Strong typing simply means that every value in the language hasone and only one type, whereas weak typing means that some values can havemultiple types. So Scheme, which is dynamically typed, is also strongly typed,while C, which is statically typed, is weakly typed (because you can cast apointer to one kind of object into a pointer to another type of object withoutaltering the pointer&#39;s value). I will only be concerned with strongly typedlanguages here.\n It turns out to be much simpler to define the Y combinator in dynamicallytyped languages, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. It is possible to define a Ycombinator in many statically typed languages, but (at least in the examplesI&#39;ve seen) such definitions usually require some non-obvious type hackery,because the Y combinator itself doesn&#39;t have a straightforward static type.That&#39;s beyond the scope of this article, so I won&#39;t mention it further.\n  A combinator is just a  lambda expression with no  freevariables. We saw above what lambda expressions are (they&#39;re justanonymous functions), but what&#39;s a free variable? It&#39;s a variable ( i.e. a name or identifier in the language) which isn&#39;t a  boundvariable. Happy now? No? OK, let me explain.\n A bound variable is simply a variable which is contained inside the body of a lambda expression that has that variable name as one of its arguments.\n   Are the variables in the body of these lambda expressions free variables or bound variables? We&#39;ll ignore the formal arguments of the lambda expressions, because only variables in the body of the lambda expression can be considered free or bound. As for the other variables, here are the answers:\n The  x in the body of the lambda expression is a boundvariable, because the formal argument of the lambda expression is also x. This lambda expression has no other variables, therefore ithas no free variables, therefore it&#39;s a combinator.\n  The  y in the lambda body is a free variable. This lambda expression is therefore not a combinator.\n  Aside from the formal arguments of the lambda expression, there is only one variable, the final  x, which is a bound variable (it&#39;s bound by the formal argument of the outer lambda expression). Therefore, this lambda expression as a whole has no free variables, so this is a combinator.\n  Aside from the formal arguments of the lambda expression, there are two variables, the final  x and  y, both bound variables. This is a combinator.\n  The entire expression is not a lambda expression, so it&#39;s by definition not a combinator. Nevertheless, the  x is a free variable and the final  y is a bound variable.\n  Again, the entire expression isn&#39;t a lambda expression (it&#39;s a function application), so this isn&#39;t a combinator either. The second  x is a bound variable while the  y is a free variable.\n  (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))\n is a combinator, you don&#39;t consider the  define part, so what you&#39;re really asking is if\n  is a combinator. Since in this lambda expression, the name factorial represents a free variable (the name factorial is not a formal argument of the lambda expression), this is not a combinator. This will be important below. In fact, the names  =,  *, and  - are also free variables, so even without the name  factorial this would not be a combinator (to say nothing of the numbers!).\n     (define factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorial (- n 1))))))\n What we want to do is to come up with a version of this that does the same thing but doesn&#39;t have that pesky recursive call to  factorial in the body of the function.\n Where do we start? It would be nice if you could save all of the function except for the offending recursive call, and put something else there. That might look like this:\n (define sort-of-factorial (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (&lt;???&gt; (- n 1))))))\n This still leaves us with the problem of what to put in the place marked  &lt;???&gt;. It&#39;s a tried-and-true principle of functional programming that if you don&#39;t know exactly what you want to put somewhere in a piece of code, just abstract it out and make it a parameter of a function. The easiest way to do this is as follows:\n (define almost-factorial (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))))\n What we&#39;ve done here is to rename the recursive call to factorial to  f, and to make  f anargument to a function which we&#39;re calling  almost-factorial.Notice that  almost-factorial is not at all the factorialfunction. Instead, it&#39;s a higher-order function which takes a single argument f, which had better be a function (or else  (f (- n1)) won&#39;t make sense), and  returns another function (the (lambda (n) ...) part) which (hopefully) will be a factorialfunction if we choose the right value for  f.\n It&#39;s important to realize that this trick is not in any way specific to the  factorial function. We can do exactly the same trick with any recursive function. For instance, consider a recursive function to compute fibonacci numbers. The recursive definition of fibonacci numbers is as follows:\n fibonacci 0 = 0 fibonacci 1 = 1 fibonacci n = fibonacci (n - 1) + fibonacci (n - 2)\n (In fact, that&#39;s the definition of the fibonacci function in Haskell.) In Scheme, we can write the function this way:\n (define fibonacci (lambda (n) (cond ((= n 0) 0) ((= n 1) 1) (else (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))))\n (where  cond is just a shorthand expression for nested  if expressions). We can then remove the explicit recursion just like we did for  factorial:\n (define almost-fibonacci (lambda (f) (lambda (n) (cond ((= n 0) 0) ((= n 1) 1) (else (+ (f (- n 1)) (f (- n 2))))))))\n As you can see, the transformation from a recursive function to a non-recursive  almost- equivalent function is a purely mechanical one: you rename the name of the recursive function inside the body of the function to  f and you wrap a  (lambda (f) ...) around the body.\n If you&#39;ve followed what I just did (never mind  why I did it; we&#39;ll see that later), then congratulations! As Yoda says, you&#39;ve just taken the first step into a larger world.\n  I probably shouldn&#39;t do this yet, but I&#39;m going to give you a sneak preview of where we&#39;re going. Once we define the Y combinator, we&#39;ll be able to define the factorial function using  almost-factorial as follows:\n  where  Y is the Y combinator. Note that this definition of factorial doesn&#39;t have any explicit recursion in it. Similarly,we can define the  fibonacci function using almost-fibonacci in the same way:\n  So the Y combinator will give us recursion wherever we need it as long as we have the appropriate  almost- function available ( i.e. the non-recursive function derived from the recursive one by abstracting out the recursive function calls).\n   Let&#39;s assume, for the sake of argument, that we already had a working factorial function lying around (recursive or not, we don&#39;t care). We&#39;ll call that hypothetical factorial function  factorialA. Now let&#39;s consider the following:\n    (define factorialB ((lambda (f) (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (f (- n 1)))))) factorialA))\n Now, by substituting  factorialA for  f inside the body of the lambda expression we get:\n (define factorialB (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (factorialA (- n 1))))))\n This looks a lot like the recursive factorial function, but it isn&#39;t: factorialA is not the same function as  factorialB.So it&#39;s a non-recursive function that depends on a hypothetical factorialA function to work. Does it actually work? Well, it&#39;spretty obvious that it should work for  n = 0, since (factorialB 0) will just return  1 (the factorial of 0). If  n &gt; 0, then the value of  (factorialBn) will be  (* n (factorialA (- n 1))). Now, we assumedthat  factorialA would correctly compute factorials, so (factorialA (- n 1)) is the factorial of  n - 1, andtherefore  (* n (factorialA (- n 1))) is the factorial of n (by the definition of factorial), thus proving that factorialB computes the factorial function correctly as long as factorialA does. So this works. The only problem is that we don&#39;tactually have a  factorialA lying around.\n Now, if you&#39;re really clever, you might be asking yourself whether we can just do this:\n  The idea is this: let&#39;s assume that  factorialA is a valid factorial function.

\n...... ", "note_en": "Status:  Rough working notes \u2013 me thinking aloud. Speculative, and likely contains errors, misconceptions, and omissions; thoughtful, informed comments are welcome. Intended for a general scientifically curious audience, not requiring much detailed specialist background.\n  It is sometimes said physics is nearing its end \u2013 closing in on a \u201ctheory of everything\u201d \u2013 because we understand so much about the basic rules governing the particles and forces in our universe. This is like asserting that computer science ended in 1936 with the Turing machine, computing&#39;s \u201ctheory of everything\u201d. Of course, that&#39;s not what happened. Rather, the invention of the Turing machine opened a new creative frontier, enabling an extraordinary profusion of new ideas.\n  Science is going through a similarly exciting transition today. Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the elementary particles and forces, and we&#39;re getting increasingly good at manipulating matter. And so we&#39;re beginning to ask: what can we build,  in principle? Not just in a practical sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but in a fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?\n  Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what Turing and company did for computation? Can we invent new high-level abstractions and design principles for matter, similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for computing? What design space is opened up when we control matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What beautiful new design ideas are possible?\n  Most of the matter in our everyday experience is constructed from just three particles: protons, electrons, and neutrons. These can be used to build an astonishing array of different things: diamonds; human beings; galaxies; black holes; iPhones. With sufficiently good tweezers and a lot of patience you could reassemble a human being into a bicycle of comparable mass; and vice versa.\n  So, what else can we build from protons, electrons, and neutrons* * Martin Rees has pointed out that we humans tend to engage in particle chauvinism, often assuming that what we think of as \u201cordinary matter\u201d is all there is to matter. Indeed, I&#39;ve engaged in just such a chauvinism in asserting above that \u201cwe understand the fundamentals of how matter works\u201d. However, based on what we currently suspect about dark matter, so-called \u201cordinary matter\u201d may actually be rather unusual, the exception rather than the rule. Nonetheless, in the absence of a good understanding of dark matter I shall continue to engage in particle chauvinism, and restrict myself in this essay to ordinary matter. Indeed, I shall go further and restrict the discussion (mostly) to protons, electrons, and neutrons. ?\n  It seems likely we can build things that would astonish us, things going radically beyond anything we can even conceive of today, much less build.\n  Consider that ten million years ago conscious minds were absent from the earth, except in quite primitive forms. Might there be forms of matter possible which are as different from anything familiar to us today as consciousness is from a rock* * Some people don&#39;t believe consciousness is a property of matter. There are limited senses in which that is reasonable: certainly, matter is a substrate, and aspects of consciousness may be independent of the details of that substrate, in a matter analogous to the way an algorithm has an existence independent of the computer it runs on. Nonetheless, I don&#39;t think there is much serious reason to doubt that consciousness is a property that emerges out of ordinary matter.?\n    One way to explore the \u201cwhat can we build?\u201d question is to look at different  maps of matter. Probably the best known such map is the periodic table, showing all the different types of atoms which make up most of the matter in the world around us. But there&#39;s many other maps of matter. There&#39;s phylogenetic trees, which show the relationship between different types of life. There&#39;s maps of the different types of stars, of the different phases of matter, of all the proteins we&#39;ve found. And many more.\n  In these notes we&#39;ll go on safari through several such maps of matter. We won&#39;t go too deep into any individual map \u2013 everything I discuss could be (often has been) the subject of PhD theses, or even an entire field. Instead, we&#39;re going to look rapidly at several different ways we explore matter. The purpose is to discern some general principles that can help us explore in generative ways.\n  When I began writing these notes I had a whimsical question in mind: is there a single, unified map we can use to understand all of matter? I hoped the attempt to make such a unified map would give me some insight into the question \u201cwhat can we build, in principle?\u201d And so, as I wrote the notes I toyed with multiple ways of making a unified map. Eventually, I realized matter is too rich and variegated for a really good unified map to be possible. What&#39;s more, to do even a passing job these notes would need to be a hundred times longer! Nonetheless, I found the attempt stimulating. And so at the end of the notes I show a single diagram which encapsulates many of the ideas for exploration developed in these notes. It&#39;s grossly incomplete, but hopefully interesting and generative.\n    The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to guide research: \u201cIn any field, find the strangest thing and explore it\u201d. One great thing about maps is that they suggest strange things. This is true even when the map itself is familiar, like the periodic table. We can ask ourselves: where are the strangest \u201cplaces\u201d in the periodic table? And then challenge ourselves to explore those places.\n  One candidate for the strangest place in the periodic table is the most recently discovered chemical element, oganesson. It&#39;s the heaviest known element, with an atomic number of 118. It&#39;s highlighted below with a red circle in the bottom right* * Image adapted from images due to users \u201cDouble sharp\u201d and \u201cOffnfopt\u201d on  Wikipedia.:\n       Oganesson was discovered in 2002 by a team of scientists headed by Yuri Oganessian, after being predicted in 1895 by Hans Peter J\u00f8rgen Julius Thomsen. It was made by using calcium ions to bombard a target of californium atoms, at very high speed. Only a handful of oganesson atoms have ever been observed \u2013 around a half dozen, with several of those observations regarded as unconfirmed.\n  We don&#39;t know much for sure about oganesson \u2013 the handful of atoms observed decayed too quickly to get much idea of what oganesson does. Despite this, intensive theoretical studies have been done, and some surprising predictions made. Oganesson is in the final column of the periodic table, and these are of course the \u201cnoble gases\u201d, highly non-reactive gases like helium and argon.\n  At least, that&#39;s the story we learn in high school chemistry. In fact, oganesson confounds these expectations. Theoretical calculations suggest oganesson is likely to be a solid semiconductor at standard temperature and pressure, not a gas. Furthermore, it may be significantly reactive, unlike the other noble gases* * Clinton S. Nash,  Atomic and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118 (2005). Note that the other noble gases  are at least somewhat reactive (disodium helide, anyone?) \u2013  Wikipedia&#39;s discussion is a good place to start \u2013 but oganesson is predicted to be significantly moreso..\n  There is a standard argument for why noble gases are non-reactive gases \u2013 the gist is to understand the electron orbital shell structure, the number of electrons in each, and why full shells are particularly stable and lead to non-reactive elements. What you learn from oganesson is that some of the principles underlying that argument can&#39;t be quite right. I must admit, I haven&#39;t worked through the details of how the standard argument breaks down (beyond quickly skimming the above paper); nonetheless, it&#39;s extremely useful to have a little flag in my head saying that the standard argument about electron orbitals and noble gases actually breaks down for some elements. That argument is often presented as being based on universal principles, but those principles are not, in fact, universal.\n  And so one benefit of exploring oganesson is that it improves other parts of your understanding of matter, even if only by informing you of limits to that understanding. And it pokes at you: the periodic table has the shape it does  because of those underlying principles. If those principles break down, should the shape of the periodic table be changed? And that in turn suggests a different question, one about human psychology and understanding rather than the principles of nature: what are the best alternative ways of visualizing the elements? Are there better ways than the standard periodic table? Just for fun, let me show you a snapshot from  Wikipedia&#39;s page of alternative periodic tables:\n       I have a biologist friend, Laura Deming, who has pointed out what she calls  the biological flywheel* * Laura Deming,  Sequencing is the new microscope (2018). Incidentally, searching on \u201cbiology flywheel\u201d also yields this  stimulating essay on a different kind of flywheel, in synthetic biology.. The flywheel works like this. As we get better at biology, we discover more and more biological processes \u2013 all sorts of amazing proteins and other molecular nanomachines* * Animation of a kinesin protein walking along a microtubule. By Wikipedia user \u201cJzp706\u201d :\n       When we discover such a machine, and start to understand the principles it operates by, that in turn becomes part of humanity&#39;s toolkit for making more discoveries. It&#39;s a kind of bootstrap or flywheel generating more progress. Here&#39;s some examples, quoted in  Deming&#39;s essay:\n  If you look at the most important techniques in biology, in the second half of the 1900s, they\u2019re all driven by tools discovered in biology itself. Biologists aren\u2019t just finding new things - they\u2019re making their new tools from biological reagents. PCR (everything that drives PCR, apart from the heater/cooler which is 1600s thermodynamics, is either itself DNA or something made by DNA), DNA sequencing (sequencing by synthesis - we use cameras/electrical detection/CMOS chips as the output, but the hijacking the way the cell makes DNA proteins remains at the heart of the technique), cloning (we cut up DNA with proteins made from DNA, stick the DNA into bacteria so living organisms can make more copies of it for us), gene editing (CRISPR is obviously made from DNA and with RNA attached), ELISA (need the ability to detect fluorescence - optics - and process the signal, but antibodies lie at the heart of this principle), affinity chromatography (liquid chromatography arguably uses physical principles like steric hindrance, or charge, but those can be traced back to the 1800s - antibodies and cloning have revolutionized this technique), FACS uses the same charge principles that western blots do, but with the addition of antibodies.\n  \u2026 If you\u2019d asked a physicist in the early 1900s how\twe\u2019d figure out the complicated, tangled structure of DNA,\the\u2019d probably say to look at it with a microscope. Sequencing\thas become the new microscope. It\u2019s easier for us to\tcross-link, fragment and sequence a full genome to figure out\tits 3-dimensional structure than it is for us to figure that\tout by looking at it head-on. We used to rely on photons and\telectrons bouncing off of biological sample to tell us what\twas going on down there. Now we\u2019re asking biology directly -\tand often the information we get back comes through a natural\tbiological reagent like DNA. Which we then sequence using\tmotors made from the DNA itself!\n  Many recent examples of this biological flywheel may be seen in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for Covid-19. Here&#39;s one: historically, vaccines have typically been developed by delivering inactivated fragments of the virus they protect against. The human immune system learns to recognize and destroy those fragments, and this provides protection against the underlying disease. But the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines for SAR-CoV-2 use a different approach. Instead of delivering inactivated virus, they simply deliver mRNA inside the body, and then rely on human cells to use the mRNA  in vivo to manufacture the spike protein characteristic of the disease. In some sense, they&#39;re using the machinery inside the human body to eliminate one complex step in the vaccine manufacturing process. This greatly simplifies the design and manufacture of the vaccine.\n  There are similar flywheels all through science, and they drive a lot of discovery. One virtue of exploring the periodic table is that it&#39;s another example of such a flywheel. As you explore you unlock new substances and new understanding: the discovery of uranium helped lead to plutonium; that helped lead to curium; that helped lead to californium; which in turn played a role in the discovery of oganesson. It&#39;s a flywheel of exploration and discovery:\n       It&#39;s perhaps a little too tongue-in-cheek, but I think there&#39;s at least a grain of truth in saying much of science has really been about discovering these flywheels, a kind of flywheel flyweel.\n    Let&#39;s come back to the map we were exploring, the periodic table. Another good question to ask is: \u201ccan we extend the map?\u201d And going even further: \u201cis there stuff that could never be on the map, even if we extend it?\u201d\n  I&#39;m going to mostly focus on the second question. The first question is, of course, a great question. There&#39;s many people working on making new elements, and lots of exciting questions. What are the ultimate limits of the periodic table? Is there some upper limit on the atomic number? There&#39;s disagreement on this question: according to Wikipedia, there are proposals that it ends at element number 128, 137, 146, 155, and 173.\n  It perhaps sounds strange that we have such a disagreement. In fact, it&#39;s in part a reflection of some flexibility in what we mean by atom. In some sense it&#39;s important that an atom be a reasonably stable, bound system. But stability is a matter of degree: even relatively common elements like uranium are unstable, decaying into other substances, like thorium. Indeed, if  proton decay occurs, then in some sense  all atoms are unstable.\n  And so the disagreement about the possible number of elements depends in part on how stable you require a system to be to qualify as an atom. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if in the far future we can cram far more than 173 protons together into a nucleus-sized region; the only in-principle limit I can think of is fermi pressure. But such pseudo-atoms won&#39;t ordinarily be very stable (though perhaps we can find clever ways of stabilizing them)!\n  What about things which aren&#39;t on our map (the periodic table) at all? Can we get entirely off the periodic table?\n  Of course, we can. Indeed, depending on whereabouts you are in the universe, atoms may actually be a relatively uncommon (or unstable) form of matter.\n  For example, the sun is often described as being made up of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other elements. That&#39;s true near the surface of the sun, which is at a temperature of about 6,000 Kelvin. But as you go inward the sun gets far hotter, eventually rising to millions Kelvin. That increasing temperature rips the hydrogen molecules and even the hydrogen atoms apart \u2013 they ionize, meaning that the single electron is ripped apart from the single proton. And so inside the core of the sun it&#39;s no longer really hydrogen atoms, but rather a giant sea of protons and electrons, largely unbound to one another (together with a lot of ionized helium, as well). In the core it doesn&#39;t make sense to say the sun is made of atoms.\n  Of course, we can get far more exotic. Inside a neutron star for the most part you won&#39;t find any atoms (though there are some ionized atoms near the surface). A neutron star is formed from the collapse of a supermassive star \u2013 so massive that the gravitational forces crush the electrons into the nucleus, where they merge with the protons to form neutrons. And you end up with an incredibly dense sea of neutrons and other, potentially more exotic, particles* * Neutron stars may not just contain a sea of neutrons, but also other even stranger states of matter. A stimulating discussion may be found  here. \u2013 a liter of neutron star has a mass of on the order of a hundred billion tonnes. If you somehow lived inside a neutron star you wouldn&#39;t think in terms of atoms at all. Rather, you&#39;d need patterns made out of neutrons. I wonder if it&#39;s possible to do that in a stable way* * The astronomer Frank Drake apparently proposed a nuclear \u201cchemistry\u201d in a 1973 interview (which I haven&#39;t read, and wasn&#39;t able to find online). The idea was later fleshed out into the science fiction novel \u201cDragon&#39;s Egg\u201d by Robert Forward.? Less speculatively, we can take away that it&#39;s actually a provincial point of view, a kind of atomic chauvinism, to regard atoms as typical, \u201cthe fundamental constituents of matter\u201d as so many of us are taught when growing up.\n    So far, we&#39;ve been concentrating mostly on types of matter found in nature, like neutron stars. But we can turn this around, and ask questions about design: what kinds of matter configuration can we stabilize in principle? In other words, instead of looking for naturally occurring substances, let&#39;s ask the question: what types of matter do the laws of physics enable us to  design? In this designer&#39;s viewpoint you ask how you can engineer reality to fit what you want. And the emphasis isn&#39;t so much on the \u201cengineer\u201d as on \u201cwhat you want\u201d. Because it turns out that figuring out what is  possible requires immense imagination.\n   This design point of view is very different than the naturalistic view of matter, where you continually explore what occurs \u201cnaturally\u201d, with relatively minimal interventions. And this designerly point of view leads to very deep questions:\n  What patterns of matter can we stabilize, in principle? What\t patterns cannot be stabilized, by any means?\n  What patterns of matter and fields are possible, in\tprinciple? How can we create them? What patterns are\t impossible?\n  Are there fundamental new design abstractions we can\tinvent for matter? In some sense the notion of an atom (or the\tplasmas inside the sun, or the ribosome inside our cells) are\tdesign abstractions supplied by nature. Can we find new ones\t ourselves?\n  Even a very simple question like \u201cWhat pattern of static electromagnetic fields can we create?\u201d is actually a pretty great question. And then: can we build a universal device to create that field? And we can ask analogous questions for other types of matter and fields.\n  Many non-designers think of design as relatively unimportant. Once on Twitter an experienced programmer and manager made the following comment about design in the software realm:\n  Honestly, I have a hard time taking the idea of a \u201cDesigner\u201d as a whole job seriously. Like you lay out buttons and text? That&#39;s it?\n   Now, what does it mean that (visual) design is \u201clay[ing] out buttons and text\u201d? It seems a little like claiming that Shakespeare was merely laying out letters of the alphabet in a particularly well-chosen fashion. There is some sense in which that&#39;s true. But the point of design, as with Shakespeare and great writing, is to discover powerful higher-order ideas. Those ideas \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:05:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7269\u8d28,maps,\u539f\u5b50", "title":

", "note_en": "Today, we\u2019re announcing ARM64EC (\u201cEmulation Compatible\u201d), a new way to build apps for Windows 11 on ARM. With the latest Visual Studio tools in preview and the Windows 11 Insider SDK, you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of ARM64EC to incrementally transition your app to running with native speed on ARM, even if you have dependencies or plugins that don\u2019t support ARM yet.\n  ARM64EC is a new application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM\u2019s built-in emulation.\n The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the existing  ARM64 ABI in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.\n  Traditionally, rebuilding an app for ARM has meant recompiling the entire app. The result is a great native experience for the customer that unlocks the full power of the ARM device. However, from a developer perspective, porting an app can be all-or-nothing, since all the binaries within a process need to be rebuilt before a customer can see the benefit.\n With ARM64EC, you can choose to start small and build incrementally. You can identify a part of your codebase that would benefit most from native performance and rebuild it as ARM64EC. The rest of the app will remain fully functional as emulated x64, but the recompiled ARM64EC parts will now have native speed.\u00a0 Over time, you can recompile more of the app as ARM64EC to further improve performance and conserve battery life for your app\u2019s customers.\n The ability to mix and match x64 and ARM64EC makes it possible to build an app for Windows 11 on ARM even if it depends on x64 code outside of your control. Projects with third-party dependencies that don\u2019t support ARM can leave them as x64.\u00a0 And apps with an in-proc plugin ecosystem can build as ARM64EC to get native speed, while continuing to load and use x64 plugins.\n  We\u2019re motivated by the potential of ARM64EC and excited to see the kinds of apps developers can build for Windows 11 on ARM using this technology.\u00a0Internally, we\u2019ve rebuilt the binaries of the Windows 11 on ARM operating system itself with ARM64EC so that any system code loaded by x64 apps runs with native speed.\u00a0 In addition, the Office team is using ARM64EC in the coming  64-bit Office for ARM so that existing x64 plugins will work seamlessly.\n You can get started with ARM64EC by downloading the latest  Windows Insider SDK and  Visual Studio Preview, then following the steps on  docs.microsoft.com to add an ARM64EC configuration.\u00a0 Looking forward, we\u2019ll have more content to share as we walk through in more detail how to take advantage of ARM64EC in your apps.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:04:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,windows,arm,building,arm64ec", "title": "ARM64EC\uff1a\u5728ARM\u4e0a\u4e3aWindows 11\u6784\u5efa\u672c\u673a\u548c\u53ef\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f ", "title_en": "ARM64EC: Building Native and Interoperable Apps for Windows 11 on ARM", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/06/28/announcing-arm64ec-building-native-and-interoperable-apps-for-windows-11-on-arm/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "windows", "arm", "building", "arm64ec"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ec3dab0920d33aa1c2fe8e6f7a51b2f1.png", "infoid": 1068517, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6570\u5b57\u3002\u7011\u5e03\u56fe\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5728Covid-19\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u4e4b\u524d\u548c\u4e4b\u540e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5185\u7684\u603b\u673a\u7cbe\u5b50\u6570\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\n      1.\u5144\u5f1f\u59d0\u59b9\r PGTK\uff0c\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\r k\uff0cshah\r MD\uff0c\r \u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u4f17\u83b7\u5f97Covid-19\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1a4\u67081\u65e5\u81f312\u67088\u65e5\uff0c2020\u5e74.Jama\u3002 2020;

A one-sample baseline and a one-sample after vaccination sperm analysis could not have shown anything.\n    Cite  This   Gonzalez DC, Nassau DE, Khodamoradi K, et al. Sperm Parameters Before and After COVID-19 mRNA Vaccination.  JAMA. Published online June 17, 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.9976\n        Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Despite high efficacy and few adverse events found in clinical trials, only 56% of individuals in the US reported wanting to receive the vaccine.  1 One of the reasons for vaccine hesitancy is the potential negative effect on fertility.  2 Because reproductive toxicity was not evaluated in the clinical trials and SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with decreases in sperm parameters,  3 we assessed sperm parameters before and after mRNA vaccine administration.\n          This single-center prospective study at the University of Miami recruited healthy volunteers aged 18 to 50 years scheduled for mRNA COVID-19 vaccine through flyers posted throughout the university hospital and internal listserve emails. The University of Miami institutional review board approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n    Men were prescreened to ensure they had no underlying fertility issues. Those with COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test result within 90 days were excluded. Participants provided a semen sample after 2 to 7 days of abstinence, prior to receiving the first vaccine dose and approximately 70 days after the second. Semen analyses were performed by trained andrologists per World Health Organization guidelines and included semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and total motile sperm count (TMSC).  4 Individuals with oligospermia (sperm concentration &lt;15 million/mL) were included. After calculating data distribution on normality test, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported for all variables. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare pre- and postvaccination semen parameters. Change in TMSC is presented graphically. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 24 (IBM). A 2-tailed  P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.\n        Between December 17, 2020, and January 12, 2021, 45 men volunteered (median age, 28 years [IQR, 25-31]); follow-up samples were obtained at a median of 75 days (IQR, 70-86) after the second dose. The study ended on April 24, 2021. Baseline samples were obtained after a median abstinence period of 2.8 days (IQR, 2-3) and follow-up samples after a median of 3 days (IQR, 3-4). Of the 45 men, 21 (46.7%) received BNT162b2 and 24 (53.3%) received mRNA-1273. Baseline sperm concentration and TMSC were 26 million/mL (IQR, 19.5-34) and 36 million (IQR, 18-51), respectively. After the second vaccine dose, the median sperm concentration significantly increased to 30 million/mL (IQR, 21.5-40.5;  P\u2009=\u2009.02) and the median TMSC to 44 million (IQR, 27.5-98;  P\u2009=\u2009.001). Semen volume and sperm motility also significantly increased ( Table).\n    Eight of the 45 men were oligospermic before the vaccine (median concentration, 8.5 million/mL [IQR, 5.1-12]). Of these 8, 7 men had increased sperm concentration to normozoospermic range at follow-up (median concentration, 22 million/mL [IQR, 17-25.5]), and 1 man remained oligospermic. No man became azoospermic after the vaccine.\n    The waterfall plot shows the within-participant change in TMSC from baseline (range, \u221222 million to 93 million) for each man ( Figure).\n        In this study of sperm parameters before and after 2 doses of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, there were no significant decreases in any sperm parameter among this small cohort of healthy men. Because the vaccines contain mRNA and not the live virus, it is unlikely that the vaccine would affect sperm parameters. While these results showed statistically significant increases in all sperm parameters, the magnitude of change is within normal individual variation and may be influenced by regression to the mean.  5 Additionally, the increase may be due to the increased abstinence time before the second sample. Men with oligospermia did not experience further decline.\n    The limitations of the study include the small number of men enrolled; limited generalizability beyond young, healthy men; short follow-up; and lack of a control group. In addition, while semen analysis is the foundation of male fertility evaluation, it is an imperfect predictor of fertility potential. Despite this, the study\u2019s time frame encompasses the full life cycle of sperm.\n                 Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Gonzalez, Nassau, Ibrahim, Blachman-Braun, Ory, Ramasamy.\n     Additional Contributions: We thank Iakov Efimenko, BSc, Justin Dubin, MD, and Manuel Molina, MD (all with University of Miami Department of Urology), for assistance with recruitment and institutional review board preparation, as well as Ali Tourchi, MD (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Department of Urology), for developing the concept of the study.

Layers upon layers of  trusted 3rd parties are necessary to distribute content online. It requires ongoing maintenance and is susceptible to censorship or hostile takedowns. In this blog post, I describe the steps I took to host my blog in a trustless, permanent, and censorship-resistant way using the IPFS network and Ethereum blockchain.\n We\u2019ll be covering many topics, including NFTs, Ethereum smart contracts, and ENS domains, but you don\u2019t need to be familiar with any of those. This post aims to help you configure your own trustless and decentralized website even if you don\u2019t have any blockchain-related experience.\n Disclaimer: The information provided in this blog post is for educational purposes only. Please do your own research on the potential consequences of trying to circumvent censorship in your jurisdiction.\n  Since I\u2019ve started blogging, it was my goal to publish on an infrastructure that I  own. Publishing on platforms like Medium is giving away your work for free.  Don\u2019t do it. If you trust the corporations to host your content permanently, you might want to read up on the  story of Yahoo groups and the desperate community attempts to salvage them.\n This blog is a static website generated with  Jekyll hosted on an AWS EC2 instance with an NGINX server and distributed via Cloudflare CDN. Cloudflare is also a registrar of my domain.\n The setup of this blog is as  proprietary as it can get with the standard web toolkit. However, it would be a vast overstatement to say that I\u2019m  in control of it.\n This blog has a bus factor of one. If I fail to fund or renew my credit cards, all my blog posts will disappear within a month or two. The best I could hope for is that someone would eventually buy back this domain to harvest the backlinks for SEO.\n Recently I\u2019ve started exploring the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. It turns out there\u2019s more to it than gambling and overpriced kittens. Read of if you want to learn how the slowly emerging Web 3.0 can help make your online presence more independent and permanent.\n  IPFS is an alternative protocol to HTTP for serving static assets. The main principle that distinguishes it from HTTP is that files are addressed by the cryptographic hash (so-called CID - Content Identifier) of their content rather than location. File with the text  Hello world! will always be addressed as  ipfs://QmXgBq2xJKMqVo8jZdziyudNmnbiwjbpAycy5RbfDBoJRM regardless if a node in the USA or India serves it.\n You can use the IPFS protocol directly if your browser supports it (Brave or Opera). Otherwise, you can access it using one of the many HTTP gateways available, i.e., the one by Cloudflare:\n  An additional bonus is that since the file\u2019s address is derived from its content, you can always verify that it has not been tampered with. After installing the  ipfs CLI you can check that our  Hello world! is indeed legit by running the following command:\n    Another powerful side-effect is that contrary to hosting files by their location, content-based addressing means that you can easily achieve the ultimate redundancy. If you host assets on AWS S3 and your account is suspended, they will no longer be accessible. IPFS assets can be downloaded as long as there\u2019s at least one node hosting them. We\u2019ll discuss how it can help the permanence of your website later in this article.\n  This blog post is by no means trying to be a comprehensive introduction to IPFS. But I\u2019d like to quickly address common misconceptions.\n IPFS is not free storage in the cloud. Noone will permanently host your files for free. Some nodes might cache them temporarily, but unless you use the so-called commercial  \u201cpinning service\u201d or run a 24/7 node yourself, your files will eventually disappear from the network.\n IPFS is uncensorable so that files can be accessed as long as at least one copy remains in the peer-to-peer network. In 2017 a Catalan government  used IPFS to bypass Spain\u2019s censorship attempts. Also,  an uncensorable version of Wikipedia was created after the Turkish government banned it. However, IPFS  is not anonymous. All the nodes publicly advertise their IPs and which files they are hosting. It means that distributing illegal content might have consequences.\n Once you upload the file to IPFS, it cannot be removed as long as at least one node is hosting it. You cannot force other nodes to remove your file.\n Unless configured otherwise, your node will temporarily cache all the content you\u2019ve accessed and distribute it to the rest of the network. However, files that you\u2019ve not accessed will never automatically be hosted by your node.\n  Short answer, YES. Long answer below, but spoiler alert: it\u2019s not yet straightforward.\n My approach when I\u2019ve started migrating this website to IPFS was to do it as close to the metal as possible. A few services can help host your website on IPFS. But, these are additional  trusted 3rd parties that I want to avoid to follow the rule that  \u201cAny trusted 3rd party is a security hole.\u201d.\n To upload content to the IPFS network, you need to start with installing the IPFS CLI. On macOS, it\u2019s a simple as typing:\n  Please refer to the  official documentation for information on how to install it on other systems.\n   The rest of this tutorial assumes that you have a folder with the contents of your static website. I\u2019m using Jekyll, but the following process will work the same regardless of the toolkit you use to generate it.\n   Next you have to make all the internal links relative. We\u2019ll be using IPFS CID of the main folder rather than hashes of individual files for linking. It means that i.e. our CSS link must look like that:\n      Otherwise, it would fail to resolve the IPFS path correctly. There\u2019s a great tool that automates this process  npm all-relative package. Let\u2019s use it:\n  Jekyll generates files with an  html extension. On IPFS, no NGINX server will translate  /about path to  about.html file. We need to strip this extension from all the files other than  index.html. In the  _blog_ipfs folder, run these commands:\n  Now we\u2019re ready to upload our static website to the IPFS network. In the parent folder, run the following command:\n if  [  -f ~/.ipfs/api  ] ;  then  export  NEW_CID = $(ipfs add  -r  --cid-version 1 _blog_ipfs |  tail  -1 |  cut  -d &#39; &#39;  -f2 ) else  echo  &#34;IPFS daemon not running&#34; ; fi\n It checks if the local IPFS node is running, uploads the whole folder, and saves its hash in the  $NEW_CID variable.\n At this point, you should already be able to access your blog both locally and via a public gateway. Assuming your CID was  bafybeiahpn3zpsp27kyxrtbelh56w7n3djorilv7um3n7df4fpbqq5gibe you can use the following links:\n    Our website is now reachable in the public IPFS network. But, we\u2019ve only uploaded our files using the local node. It means that when our computer goes offline, the website might no longer be reachable after it\u2019s cleared from other nodes\u2019 cache.\n Let\u2019s fix it by using the previously mentioned  \u201cpinning\u201d services. Currently, I\u2019m uploading each new release of my blog to both  Pinata Cloud and  Infura. Since files are addressed by the hash of their content instead of location, uploading to multiple providers is possible.\n Both services have a support for HTTP API. After obtaining your credentials you can use Pinata like that:\n curl  -X POST  &#34;https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinByHash&#34;  \\ -H  &#34;pinata_api_key:  $PINATA_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;pinata_secret_api_key:  $PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34;  \\ -d  &#34;{  \\&#34; hashToPin \\&#34; : \\&#34; $NEW_CID \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; pinataMetadata \\&#34; : {  \\&#34; name \\&#34; : \\&#34; blog_release \\&#34;  }}&#34;\n   I\u2019m not completely satisfied with this setup. Both services are currently dependent on my credit cards. I\u2019d love to find a service that allows me to prepay the storage period up front. There used to be  Eternum that worked exactly like that but they are no longer onboarding new clients.\n There\u2019s a lot of discussion about  Filecoin that\u2019s designed to store files in a trustless way. However, I could not find a production-ready service that supports hosting IPFS folder files and is backed by Filecoin protocol. If you know something reliable, please let me know in the comments.\n Two providers instead of a single EC2 instance is still a considerable improvement compared to my previous infrastructure. This ecosystem is evolving rapidly. I\u2019m looking forward to revisiting this part of my setup in a couple of months.\n  You can now reach your audience, but those URLs are just ugly and impossible to memorize. Let\u2019s see how we can improve it.\n A standard way to address IPFS files using a DNS system is to use the so-called  DNSLink. It is a TXT DNS record that maps the website URL to its corresponding IPFS CID. I\u2019m mirroring the contents of this blog on the  ipfs subdomain:\n  More details on why I did not migrate the root domain will be provided later.\n You can check out the current DNSLink entry for this blog by running the following command:\n      I use the following cURL call during the deployment process to update the TXT DNS entry with a new CID value in Cloudflare:\n curl  -X PUT  &#34;https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/ $CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID /dns_records/ $IPFS_DNS_ID &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;X-Auth-Email:  $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;X-Auth-Key:  $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34;  \\ -d  &#34;{  \\&#34; type \\&#34; : \\&#34; TXT \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; name \\&#34; : \\&#34; _dnslink.ipfs \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; ttl \\&#34; :1,  \\&#34; content \\&#34; : \\&#34; dnslink=/ipfs/ $NEW_CID \\&#34;  }&#34;\n Make sure to always always enable  DNSSEC to at least somehow mitigate the threat of tampering with DNS query results.\n We still depend on our domain and its registrar as a trusted 3rd party. It means that this solution is nowhere close to the promised  censorship-resistant and  trustless.\n Let\u2019s see how  Ethereum\u2019s Name Service can help us improve that.\n  ENS is a simple way to share your cryptocurrency wallet addresses and other data like social media accounts.  pawelurbanek.eth just in case one of the readers decided to throw some ETH or crypto kitties donation my way.\n Information about the domain ownership and all the corresponding metadata persists in the Ethereum blockchain. In addition to the cost of the domain ($5/year), you have to pay the gas fees. You can claim domain ownership for as long as you see fit. On the contrary, the Cloudflare domain registrar supports a maximum of 10 years. Being able to purchase your domain for an unrestricted period is an excellent step towards the permanence of your online presence.\n    There\u2019s a special  CONTENT entry that lets you specify a CID hash of an IPFS file that should be assigned to your domain. It will display the file, in our case a previously built website, to the visitors. No more cumbersome hash addresses!\n  The  link suffix is necessary because  eth is not a top-level domain supported by standard browsers. In theory, Brave and Opera have added native support for it, but I\u2019ve found it to be randomly lagging and sometimes completely broken. On Firefox and Chrome, you can add support for  eth domains  via a popular Metamask extension. Unfortunatelly, it\u2019s a bit confusing because you have to prefix domain name with  https://. You can also use  an Unstoppable Domains extension that does not require the manual prefix.\n Please be aware that ENS also uses DNS protocol under the hood. You can inspect what TXT entries are added for your domain by running this command:\n  An honorable mention here is an  Unstoppable Domains project that works similarly to ENS. It offers a more  cool  crypto domain extension.\n Both projects distribute domains in the form of NFT (non-fungible token, ERC271 standard). It means that ownership is confirmable on an Ethereum blockchain and cannot be tampered with. Since NFT is a unified standard, you can see all your domains by logging into a popular NFT marketplace  OpenSea.\n    ENS blockchain-based addressing eliminates a trusted 3rd party, i.e., your ICANN dependent domain registrar. One downside is that each data update costs money, ~$1.5 at the time of writing. Also, there\u2019s a slight inconvenience for visitors who must install the extension or use the  link suffix.\n When it comes to censorship, your subdomain in the  *.eth.link namespace could be censored by government-level actors. But CID of your IPFS website can always be retrieved straight from the blockchain or via the  web3 JavaScript API:\n   But, can you completely trust the Ethereum ENS system? I think it all depends on your level of paranoia and trust issues. In theory, you must have access to private keys to update domain-related data. But in practice\u2026\n   \u201ckeyholders can replace the contracts that govern issuing and managing domains (on .eth or any other top-level domain), giving them ultimate control over the structure of the ENS system and the names registered in it.\u201d\n \u201cOver time, we plan to reduce and decentralise human control over the system\u201d\n It means that currently, ENS is not 100% trustless. If you want to distribute your content CID in a way that\u2019s entirely under your control and impossible to censor, you could use a custom Ethereum smart contract. Smart contracts are immutable programs deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. You could use it as a medium for advertising the recent CID of the website to your audience. UX would be terrible. Potential users would have to read the raw contract state on the Etherscan or directly from blockchain on their proprietary full node.\n But, I could not think of a better way to publicly distribute information in a way that\u2019s 100% independent of any 3rd party. Feedback appreciated.\n Check out a sample code for the Solidity smart contract that could serve this purpose:\n contract  CIDStorage  {  address  public  immutable  owner  =  msg . sender ;  uint256  public  updatedAt  =  block . timestamp ;  string  public  currentCID ;  function  setNewCID ( string  memory  _newCID )  external  {  require ( msg . sender  ==  owner ,  &#34;Access denied!&#34; );  currentCID  =  _newCID ;  updatedAt  =  block . timestamp ;  } }\n I\u2019ve deployed this sample contract to the  Ropsten test network. You can read its state even if you don\u2019t have a Metamask extension configured.\n    Here\u2019s a full script that I currently use to build and deploy my Jekyll website.\n if  [  !  -f ~/.ipfs/api  ] ;  then  echo  &#34;IPFS daemon not running&#34; ;  exit 1 ; fi JEKYLL_ENV =production jekyll build  --destination _blog_ipfs/ cd _blog_ipfsall-relative for file  in  *.html ;  do  mv  --  &#34; $file &#34;  &#34; ${ file %%.html } &#34; done mv index index.html cd .. export  NEW_CID = $(ipfs add  -r  --cid-version 1 _blog_ipfs |  tail  -1 |  cut  -d &#39; &#39;  -f2 ) echo  &#34;New release CID:&#34; echo  $NEW_CID echo  $NEW_CID  &gt; latest_ipfs_release.txtcurl  &#34;https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/ $NEW_CID /&#34;  &gt; /dev/nullcurl  -X PUT  &#34;https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/ $CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID /dns_records/ $IPFS_DNS_ID &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;X-Auth-Email:  $CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;X-Auth-Key:  $CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34;  \\ -d  &#34;{  \\&#34; type \\&#34; : \\&#34; TXT \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; name \\&#34; : \\&#34; _dnslink.ipfs \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; ttl \\&#34; :1,  \\&#34; content \\&#34; : \\&#34; dnslink=/ipfs/ $NEW_CID \\&#34;  }&#34;curl  -X POST  &#34;https://api.pinata.cloud/pinning/pinByHash&#34;  \\ -H  &#34;pinata_api_key:  $PINATA_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;pinata_secret_api_key:  $PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY &#34;  \\ -H  &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34;  \\ -d  &#34;{  \\&#34; hashToPin \\&#34; : \\&#34; $NEW_CID \\&#34; ,  \\&#34; pinataMetadata \\&#34; : {  \\&#34; name \\&#34; : \\&#34; blog_release \\&#34;  }}&#34; sleep 45curl  -X POST  &#34;https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/api/v0/pin/add?arg= $NEW_CID &#34;  \\ -u  &#34; $INFURA_IPFS_PROJECT_ID : $INFURA_IPFS_PROJECT_SECRET &#34;\n   This script does not automatically update the CID hash in the ENS domain. It costs ~$1.5 per deployment, so I only do it manually for major releases. I use a cURL call to Cloudflare IPFS gateway to speed up the new upload propagation.  sleep 45 is necessary to prevent timeouts when trying to pin a new CID in Infura before it propagates in the network.\n  As previously mentioned, I\u2019ve not decided to migrate my root domain to IPFS. There are a few disadvantages of the described setup. Let\u2019s cover them one-by-one:\n  My commenting system Commento expects a single predefined domain. IPFS website can be browsed via any gateway or natively, so it wouldn\u2019t work correctly. Right now, commenting is possible only if you access my blog via its root domain.\n  It\u2019s not possible to add client-side caching headers for IPFS websites configured with DNSLink.Instead, they use an ETag for caching. It\u2019s not a disaster but generates unnecessary additional 304 requests on each page refresh. Websites accessed via  \u201cugly\u201d CID URLs use the correct client-side caching but for the cost of suboptimal browsing UX.\n    You can compare caching related headers used for  \u201cnice\u201d vs.  \u201cugly\u201d URLs by running the following commands:\n  You\u2019ll notice that the latter is missing the  cache-control header. It\u2019s not a bug but rather a limitation of this setup because adding this header could result in stale cache issues for new releases.\n  Unfortunatelly, I\u2019ve noticed both  crypto and  eth.link domains to randomly fail. From time to time my website would not load and cURL call returned the following DNS resultion error:\n  It usually fixed itself after a few tries. DNSLink with custom domain was working more reliably than  eth.link and  crypto extensions.\n Most of my traffic comes from Google search results. I\u2019m afraid that the degraded reliability of this website could hurt its SEO rating. All the posts mirrored to IPFS advertise their root domain copies as a canonical version using  rel=&#34;canonical tag. I suspect that the main culprit of the problems I\u2019ve noticed is the so-called IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System) that\u2019s currently known to be imperfect. I\u2019m sure that this situation will improve over time. But, right now, I\u2019d not risk moving a domain that\u2019s depending on SEO organic traffic to IPFS.\n  This blog has been around for a while, and I use a few custom NGINX redirect rules to salvage my old backlinks and smoothly handle no longer supported Google AMP pages. IPFS does not allow for such a fine-tuned control. This problem would probably not exist for new websites or the ones with simpler SEO-related requirements.\n  My website might not be the perfect candidate to use IPFS as its primary hosting platform. But, I believe that for some use cases, none of the issues mentioned would outweigh the benefits of running an uncensorable and decentralized website.\n This post turned out much longer than I had anticipated. Congrats on making it to the end! As I\u2019ve mentioned, these are my first steps in the Web 3.0 ecosystem, so I may have mixed something up. Please let me know in the comments if you\u2019ve noticed any errors.\n I want to exaggerate that the setup described has nothing to do with anonymity. Your website might be uncensorable from the outside, but it\u2019s possible to track your public IP address based on your IPFS node or blockchain operations.\n The vision of the future internet that\u2019s decentralized and controlled by users rather than a few IT giants is pretty exciting. The current Web 3.0 ecosystem offers some truly unique features but is still in a pretty rough state. I believe that now might be a perfect time to get involved as an early adopter.\n       Advertisement  Big thanks to ScoutAPM for sponsoring my blog\u2019s Ruby and Rails performance related content.

", "note_en": "Last week\u2019s mass-wiping of Western Digital My Book Live storage devices involved the exploitation of not just one vulnerability\u00a0but a second critical security bug that allowed hackers to remotely perform a factory reset without a password, an investigation shows.\n The vulnerability is remarkable because it made it trivial to wipe what is likely petabytes of user data. More notable still was that, according to the vulnerable code itself, a Western Digital developer actively removed code that required a valid user password before allowing factory resets to proceed.\n  The undocumented vulnerability resided in a file aptly named system_factory_restore. It contains a PHP script that performs resets, allowing users to restore all default configurations and wipe all data stored on the devices.\n Normally, and for good reason, factory resets require the person making the request to provide a user password. This authentication ensures that devices exposed to the Internet can only be reset by the legitimate owner and not by a malicious hacker.\n As the  following script shows, however, a Western Digital developer created five lines of code to password-protect the reset command. For unknown reasons, the authentication check was cancelled, or in developer parlance, it was commented out as indicated by the double / character at the beginning of each line.\n  \u201cThe vendor commenting out the authentication in the system restore endpoint really doesn&#39;t make things look good for them,\u201d HD Moore, a security expert and the CEO of network discovery platform Rumble, told Ars. \u201cIt\u2019s like they intentionally enabled the bypass.\u201d\n To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would have had to know the format of the XML request that triggers the reset. That\u2019s \u201cnot quite as easy as hitting a random URL with a GET request, but [it\u2019s] not that far off, either,\u201d Moore said.\n   The discovery of the second exploit comes five days after people all over the world reported that their  My Book Live devices had been compromised and then factory-reset so that all stored data was wiped. My Book Live is a book-sized storage device that uses an Ethernet jack to connect to home and office networks so that connected computers have access to the data on it. Authorized users can also access their files and make configuration changes over the Internet. Western Digital stopped supporting the My Book Live in 2015. Western Digital personnel  posted an advisory following the mass wiping that said it resulted from attackers exploiting  CVE-2018-18472. The remote command execution vulnerability was  discovered in late 2018 by security researchers Paulos Yibelo and Daniel Eshetu. Because it came to light three years after Western Digital stopped supporting the My Book Live, the company never fixed it.\n    An analysis performed by Ars and Derek Abdine, CTO at security firm Censys, found that the devices hit by last week\u2019s mass hack had also been subjected to attacks that exploited the unauthorized reset vulnerability. The additional exploit is documented in log files extracted from two hacked devices.\n One of the logs was  posted in the Western Digital  support forum where the mass compromise first came to light. It shows someone from the IP address 94.102.49.104 successfully restoring a device:\n rest_api.log.1:Jun 23 15:46:11 MyBookLiveDuo REST_API[9529]: 94.102.49.104 PARAMETER System_factory_restore POST : erase = none rest_api.log.1:Jun 23 15:46:11 MyBookLiveDuo REST_API[9529]: 94.102.49.104 OUTPUT System_factory_restore POST SUCCESS\n A  second log file I obtained from a hacked My Book Live device showed a different IP address\u201423.154.177.131\u2014exploiting the same vulnerability. Here are the telltale lines:\n Jun 16 07:28:41 MyBookLive REST_API[28538]: 23.154.177.131 PARAMETER System_factory_restore POST : erase = format Jun 16 07:28:42 MyBookLive REST_API[28538]: 23.154.177.131 OUTPUT System_factory_restore POST SUCCESS\n After presenting these findings to Western Digital representatives, I received the following confirmation: \u201cWe can confirm that in at least some of the cases, the attackers exploited the command injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-18472), followed by the factory reset vulnerability. It\u2019s not clear why the attackers exploited both vulnerabilities. We\u2019ll request a CVE for the factory reset vulnerability and will update our bulletin to include this information.\u201d\n  The discovery raises a vexing question: if the hackers had already obtained full root access by exploiting CVE-2018-18472, what need did they have for this second security flaw? There\u2019s no clear answer, but based on the evidence available, Abdine has come up with a plausible theory\u2014that one hacker first exploited CVE-2018-18472 and a rival hacker later exploited the other vulnerability in an attempt to wrest control of those already compromised devices.\n The attacker who exploited CVE-2018-18472\u00a0used the code execution capability it provided to modify a file in the My Book Live stack named language_configuration.php, which is where the vulnerability is located. According to a  recovered file, the modification added the following lines:   }\n   $langConfigObj = new LanguageConfiguration();  if(!isset($changes[&#34;submit&#34;]) || sha1($changes[&#34;submit&#34;]) != &#34;56f650e16801d38f47bb0eeac39e21a8142d7da1&#34;) \t{ \tdie(); \t}  The change prevented anyone from exploiting the vulnerability without the password that corresponds to the cryptographic SHA1 hash 56f650e16801d38f47bb0eeac39e21a8142d7da1. It turns out that the password for this hash is p$EFx3tQWoUbFc%B%R$k@. The plaintext appears in the recovered log file  here.\n    A  separate modified language_configuration.php file recovered from a hacked device used a different password that corresponds to the hash 05951edd7f05318019c4cfafab8e567afe7936d4. The hackers used a third hash\u2014b18c3795fd377b51b7925b2b68ff818cc9115a47\u2014to password-protect a separate file named accessDenied.php. It was likely done as an insurance policy in the event that Western Digital released an update that patched language_configuration.\n  According to Western Digital\u2019s advisory linked above, some of the My Book Live devices hacked using CVE-2021-18472 were infected with malware called  .nttpd,1-ppc-be-t1-z, which was written to run on the PowerPC hardware used by My Book Live devices. One user in the support forum  reported a hacked My Book Live receiving  this malware, which  makes devices part of a botnet called Linux.Ngioweb.\n  So why would someone who successfully wrangled so many My Book Live devices into a botnet turn around and wipe and reset them? And why would someone use an undocumented authentication bypass when they already have root access?\n The most likely answer is that the mass wipe and reset was performed by a different attacker, very possibly a rival who either attempted to take control of the rival\u2019s botnet or simply wanted to sabotage it.\n \u201cAs for motive for POSTing to this [system_factory_restore] endpoint on a mass scale, it is unknown, but it could be an attempt at a rival botnet operator to take over these devices or render them useless, or someone who wanted to otherwise disrupt the botnet which has likely been around for some time, since these issues have existed since 2015,\u201d Abdine wrote in a  recent blog post.\n The discovery of this second vulnerability means that My Book Live devices are even more insecure than most people thought. It adds authority to Western Digital\u2019s recommendation to all users to disconnect their devices from the Internet. Anyone using one of these devices should heed the call immediately.\n For many hacked users who lost years&#39; or decades&#39; worth of data, the thought of buying another Western Digital storage device is probably out of the question.

 \r\tCM-1 T-shirt\n   Thirty years after its launch in 1987, a CM-2 is on exhibit as part of the show:  \r &#34; Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959-1989&#34; \rMoMA NY, November 13, 2017 - April 8, 2018\n  I participated in a panel discussion at MoMA on Nov. 14, 2017: \r &#34; Thinking Machines: An Evening with Beryl Korot, Zabet Patterson, and Tamiko Thiel&#34; \rWatch the recording  &gt; here\n  See also the pages on the  CM-1/CM-2 Design Legacy, and the untold story of how \r the Connection Machine  changed Steve Jobs sense of the potential of design.\n       The  Connection Machine CM-1 was the first commercial supercomputer designed expressly for problems of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A massively parallel supercomputer with 65,536 processors, it was the brainchild \r of Danny Hillis, conceived in the early 1980s while he was a doctoral student with\r Marvin Minsky at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, and built at his start-up Thinking Machines Corporation. Departing from conventional computer \r architecture of the time, the CM-1 was modeled on the structure of a human brain: rather than relying on a\r single powerful processor to perform calculations one after another, the data was distributed over the\r tens of thousands of simple 1-bit processors, all of which could perform calculations simultaneously, an architecture known as Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD).\n  What enabled the processors to communicate faster than previous SIMD designs was the internal network, a 12-dimensional boolean n-cube structure suggested by Nobel Prize physicist  Richard Feynman, who spent his summers working with us. Within this hardwired physical structure, the software data\r structures for communication and transfer of data between processors could change as needed depending \r on the nature of the problem. The connections between processors were more important\r than the processors themselves, hence the name &#34;Connection Machine.&#34;\n  In 1987 the CM-1 was superceded by the more powerful CM-2 in the same package and similar architecture. In 1991 the CM-1/CM-2 hypercube design was superceded by the  CM-5, with a very different form and architecture. Each in their day won the prestigious  Gordon Bell Prize as the most powerful supercomputers in the world, the CM-2 in 1989 and the CM-5  in 1993.\n      From 1983-1985 I directed the packaging and industrial design of the \rConnection Machine CM-1 at Thinking Machines Corporation, working with industrial design consultants\r  Allen Hawthorne and  Gordon Bruce, and mechanical engineering consultant Ted Bilodeau. The CM-2, released\rin 1987, was a more advanced successor (including floating point hardware) contained in the same physical package.\n  The form of the machine was to express both its function and the passions of its creators: \rthe dream of producing a &#34;Machina Sapiens,&#34; a new genus of living, thinking machines. For a description of the design history, theory and concepts behind the visual design, see my article:\n  Thiel, Tamiko. &#34;The Design \r of the Connection Machine,&#34; ( pdf or  html) in Design Issues, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, Vol. 10, No. 1, Spring 1994. pp. 5-18.    \r Republished in \r\rthe book &#34;The Designed World: Images, Objects, Environments.&#34; Editors: Richard Buchanan, Dennis Doordan and Victor Margolin, 2010.\n    My old friend  Joanna Hoffman was marketing manager for the first Macintosh and the NeXT computer, and Steve Jobs&#39; &#34;right hand,&#34; as depicted by Kate Winslet in the film &#34; Steve Jobs.&#34; In 1986, when the Connection Machine came out, Jobs asked her to get its designer to create his new  NeXT computer as well. To which Joanna replied, &#34; Too late, Tamiko has gone to Europe to become an artist!&#34; But the machine made a lasting impression on him, and from that point on, Jobs&#39; designs were not merely useful - they were visually sublime.\n        &#34;There have even been heroes of computer design: The CM-1 and CM-2 parallel supercomputers of the 1980s, designed by a team headed by Tamiko Thiel, were elegant and fascinating. At Yale, visitors stopped by the machine room often to admire the thing just as sculpture.&#34; \r Gelernter, David. &#34; Beyond the Grey Box,&#34; ID Magazine, Vol. 45 #2, March/April 1998, page 60.\n        In the early/mid 1980s both AI and parallel processing were considered of interest only for ivory tower academics, not for real world computing and problem solving. Danny Hillis&#39; radical new approach to computing, however, attracted scientists to Thinking Machines who saw the value and the promise of a computing paradigm that focused on the structures required by the data itself, rather than faster and faster serial processors.\n  Today&#39;s History of AI timelines omit the work that Danny and other scientists did at Thinking Machines and on the Connection Machines. Their contributions have been forgotten. But my interviews with several colleagues reveal how the ideas, the programming techniques, the software and the hardware shaped the technology of the world today. A few examples:\n  Nobel physicist Richard Feynman used the Connection Machine to work on his seminal ideas for a new field:  quantum computing.\n  Brewster Kahle talks about his term &#34;Big Data&#34; and how he used the Connection Machine to develop the first natural language search engine.\n  Danny Hillis talks about how Google became the world&#39;s premiere search engine and AI company, first using parallel programming techniques that Sergey Brin learned on a Connection Machine, and then with the acquisition of Danny&#39;s subsequent company MetaWeb - whose CTO John Giannandrea is now Google&#39;s head of AI.\n  Even the hardware enabling Deep Learning today consists of chips that are in essence miniature Connection Machines, as are the GPUs built by nVidia that enable the success of virtual reality now, 30 years later.\n            At its height, I have heard there were various Connection Machines (CM-1, CM-2, CM-2a, CM-200 and the successor CM-5 in a completely different package design) at 70 installations around the world. The following machines\r have been preserved in museum collections. Machines are not always on exhibit - see notes.\n  CM-2a:  Mus\u00e9e Bolo, Lausanne, Switzerland  (Permanent exhibit)  \r (\r The CM-2a is a single cube package by Mark Harrison.)", "posttime":

been put up for sale online, making this one of the largest LinkedIn data leaks to date. And after making contact with the seller, we have updated this article with more information, including how the data was obtained and the possible impact on LinkedIn users.\n Many people trust LinkedIn with all sorts of private data, hoping and trusting that the information remains in safe hands. But is this trust warranted? So far in 2021, we have already seen two separate incidents where bad actors have exploited the professional networking platform to harvest vast amounts of user data.\n The implications of this are far-ranging, from identity theft to phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, and more. Before we dive into the consequences of this leak, let\u2019s first examine what happened.\n  On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from  700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a  sample of the data that includes  1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n   The user claims that the complete database contains the personal information of 700 Million LinkedIn users. Since LinkedIn has 756 million users, according to its website, this would mean that  92% of all LinkedIn users can be found in these records.\n Below is a small section of the sample we examined to show you how much information one record can contain:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all  data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data  does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n While we did not find login credentials or financial data in the samples we examined, there is still a treasure trove of information for bad actors to exploit for financial gain, as we\u2019ll explain more below.\n  We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by  exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n  We have also reached out to LinkedIn for comment on this latest data leak, but have not yet heard back.\n  While this latest LinkedIn leak did not contain any financial records or login credentials, there are still serious consequences. This is because it puts 700+ million people at risk of:\n  Cybercriminals can use the information found in the leaked files with other data in order to create  full detailed profiles of their potential victims. Additionally, bad actors can use the available data, particularly usernames, emails, and personal information, to gain access to other accounts.\n Above all else, this information exposes LinkedIn users to a higher risk of exploitation by bad actors.\n   This leads us to an interesting question. Should companies be held liable when user data is exploited by bad actors? In this specific case, it does not appear that LinkedIn servers were hacked or there was a full \u201cbreach\u201d in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, however, the  data was harvested through LinkedIn\u2019s own API ( application program interface) by threat actors.\n   We\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: any business, individual, or entity that has control over your private data puts you at risk. Whether this risk is minimal or vast depends on the data, who is securing it, and the consequences of it being lost.\n To minimize this risk, you need to  limit the amount of data that is available to others.\n This could include getting off of all social networks entirely, or limiting the information you share.

I was always happy not to be them or be sitting with them.  I always kept the lively conversation flowing at my table.  I had good boundaries between my on- and offline lives. But now, restaurants around the world have nonconsensually turned us all into the people I used to judge. I hate it. And it\u2019s time for us to go back.\n    It all started when outdoor dining resumed after initial waves of mandated closures last spring. Wary of wayward coronaviruses lingering on physical menus, restaurants taped QR codes to their tables and outsourced the act of menu delivery to the diner and her smartphone. This might have made sense when it still seemed possible that the coronavirus was largely spreading through surface transmission. But we now know that the risk of infection via a contaminated surface  is low. In tons of communities across the U.S., vaccination rates are high and COVID-19 case rates are low. People are attending indoor concerts, grinding at dance clubs, and heading back to the office. And yet, even as we eat and slobber and sneeze in restaurants seated at full capacity, in many of those establishments, we\u2019re still obliged to use our own smartphones to figure out what we want to eat. Why? Why should we be scared to go back to touching a communal piece of paper when we\u2019re already breathing one another\u2019s theoretically more dangerous air?\n        The obvious pitfalls of the QR code menu were well worth the aggravation as a temporary public health measure, and I truly feel for restaurant owners and workers who\u2019ve been forced to redesign their businesses every few months in response to changing municipal regulations and public health findings. But the QR code\u2019s continued ubiquity well into the era of the low surface transmission consensus and the full reopening of public spaces has me worried that digital-only menus will be one pandemic modification that becomes a permanent element of public life. Maybe restaurant owners will welcome the demise of physical menus as a way to eliminate one small but constant expense. Maybe their employees will relish their newfound freedom from the hassle of reprinting menus every time there\u2019s a new seasonal entree on offer. Maybe it will free servers from patrons who always seem to want to order the one dish that\u2019s out of stock. (It can be easily deleted from a digital menu as soon as it runs out.) Maybe diners who already love scrolling on their phones at restaurants will be more than happy to check out the menu there, too. Other customers may be content to touch one less surface that might be stained with food or invisibly smeared with another person\u2019s snot.\n      Not I! I\u2019m tired of having to navigate a new digital platform every time I eat out. I despise spending the first 10 minutes of a social engagement on my phone. I never again want to encounter, as I did last week, a QR code that leads to a website where  each of the seven menu pages is a separate PDF that must be clicked, zoomed in on, and closed before moving on to the next.\n  If you think I\u2019m being overdramatic, let me ask you this: Have you gone to a restaurant with your boomer parents during the pandemic? If not, have you ever had to teach your boomer parents how to set up a Roku or connect their printer to Bluetooth? Same tedious, excruciating, relationship-straining thing. One of my family members is in his late 70s, loves dining out, and only owns a flip phone with no internet connectivity. He\u2019s already excluded from much of our increasingly digital society; before the pandemic, the American restaurant was one of the few places left where he was entirely comfortable with the mores and knew exactly what was expected of him when he walked through the door. Now, he never knows what to anticipate or what he\u2019ll be asked to do when he goes out for lunch.\n      Default-digital menus are alienating for other kinds of customers, too. Critics have rightly noted that the  cashless trend in food and retail is prohibitive for customers who don\u2019t have bank accounts. Likewise, for a customer who doesn\u2019t have a smartphone or robust data plan\u2014including about  one-quarter of adults with household incomes below $30,000 per year\u2014a QR code menu means having to ask for special accommodations she never used to need. Ditto foreign travelers, whose smartphones may not work on U.S. soil. QR codes also  open the door for easily executed scams, malware, and digital surveillance. There is no good reason to add an exclusionary, risky, socially deadening digital step to an analog system that was working just fine before the pandemic hit.\n    Some restaurants have taken it even further, digitizing not just the menu but the entire dining experience. Two months ago, I ate outdoors at a Basque restaurant that used to have fantastic service on its outdoor patio. This time, it required diners to page through an extensive website that held its menu options. We had to place food and drink orders on an online platform and punch in our credit card information on our tiny phone keyboards with our big, dumb fingers. Then, we had to wait for a notification on our phones to tell us our drinks were ready to pick up indoors. When we decided to order a second bottle of cider midway through the meal, we had to place a whole new order online. It felt more like ordering takeout or shopping on Amazon than dining out.\n      It is possible that I socialize in some kind of Luddite bubble, but I\u2019ve only ever heard from one person who loves the new QR code restaurant experience. My colleague, a single woman in her 30s in D.C., said she likes the restaurants that now require customers to view the menu, order,  and pay via QR code, fully eliminating most of a server\u2019s responsibilities. (This mode of operation may make sense for restaurants that have faced  staffing shortages since reopening. I will happily pay higher prices at an adequately staffed restaurant that pays a living wage.) Since each diner orders and pays on her own, my colleague said, it\u2019s made it easier to dine with groups of friends who might have otherwise struggled with splitting a check, and it\u2019s preempted awkward conversations with guys on dates about who\u2019s getting the bill.\n      I suppose I can see where she\u2019s coming from. During a bad date or a social interaction that\u2019s reached its natural end, the wait to receive and pay the check can feel interminable. But people don\u2019t visit sit-down restaurants because they want a meal marked by extreme convenience and speed. As several restaurant workers have told me during the pandemic,  diners come to restaurants for hospitality. For me, the pleasure of poring over a physical menu is so integral to the experience of dining out that I  made my friends mimic it during an early-pandemic dinner over Zoom. We\u2019ve all just had the most isolated, screen-mediated year of our lives. If there\u2019s an opportunity for us to make a familiar social interaction more tangible and human, and less coldly transactional, let\u2019s take it.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u83dc\u5355,menus,\u9910\u5385", "title": "\u5e26\u56de\u83dc\u5355\uff0cQR\u7801\u662f\u53ef\u6015\u7684 ", "title_en": "Bring back menus, QR codes are terrible", "transed": 1, "url": "https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/06/bring-back-menus-end-qr-codes.html?via=rss", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u83dc\u5355", "menus", "\u9910\u5385"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4ac7b3fafb966aad80cfb00e4b0a8b41.png", "infoid": 1068511, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9Wioguard VPN\u96a7\u9053\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u5f7c\u6b64\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5728\u5bb6\u91cc\uff0c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u3002\n  Wiretrustee\u4f7f\u7528\u5728PION / ICE\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684WebRTC Ice\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u8bbe\u5907\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u63a5\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002\n  \u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u5bf9\u7b49\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7528Wioguard\u952e\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u67e5\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u8def\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5171Wiguard\u952e\u3002\n \u5076\u5c14\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684NAT\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7ea7NAT\uff09\uff0cNAT-Traversal\u662f\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b64\u4e8b\u9879\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u56de\u9000\uff08\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u5b89\u5168\u7684Wireguard\u96a7\u9053\u3002 Coturn\u662f\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u548c\u7ffb\u8f6cWiretrustee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\n  Wioguard\u5bc6\u94a5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u7b49\u952e\u5e76\u5728WireTrustee\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n \u5bf9\u7b49\u5730\u5740\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u914d\u7f6eWiretrustee\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u5fc5\u987b\u6307\u5b9a\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u672c\u5730\u5730\u5740\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c10.30.30.1/24\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n                      \u5bf9\u4e8eWindows Systems\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728PowerShell\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u547d\u4ee4\u5c06WireTrustee\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\uff1a \nCD C\uff1a\\ path \\ to \\ wiretrustee \\ bin\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1--help\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1\u5b89\u88c5\uff03\u8fd9\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6743\u9650\u624d\u80fd\u5b89\u88c5\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunurls stun\uff1astun.wiretrustee.com\uff1a3468\uff0cstun\uff1astun.l.google.com\uff1a19302 \\ --turnurls\uff06lt;\u8f6c\u52a8\u7528\u6237\uff06gt ;:\uff06lt;\u6253\u5f00\u5bc6\u7801\uff06gt;

At home, the office, or anywhere else.\n  Wiretrustee uses WebRTC ICE implemented in  pion/ice library to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between devices.\n  Contents of the messages sent between peers through the signaling server are encrypted with Wireguard keys, making it impossible to inspect them.The routing of the messages on a Signalling server is based on public Wireguard keys.\n Occasionally, the NAT-traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT).For that matter, there is support for a relay server fallback (TURN) and a secure Wireguard tunnel is established via TURN server. Coturn is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in Wiretrustee setups.\n  Wireguard key management. In consequence, you need to generate peer keys and specify them on Wiretrustee initialization step. This feature is on the roadmap.\n Peer address management. You have to specify a unique peer local address (e.g. 10.30.30.1/24) when configuring Wiretrustee. This feature is on the roadmap.\n                      For Windows systems, we can use the service command to configure Wiretrustee as a service by running the following commands in Powershell:\n cd C: \\path \\to \\wiretrustee \\bin. \\wiretrustee.exe service --help. \\wiretrustee.exe service install   # This will prompt for administrator permissions in order to install a new service\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302 \\ --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468 \\ --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000 \\ --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24 \\ --log-level info\n  . \\wiretrustee.exe init   `  --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302  ` --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468   `  --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000  ` --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24   `  --log-level info\n It is important to mention that the  wgLocalAddr parameter has to be unique across your network.E.g. if you have Peer A with  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.1/24 then another Peer B can have  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.2/24\n If for some reason, you already have a generated Wireguard key, you can specify it with the  --wgKey parameter.If not specified, then a new one will be generated, and its corresponding public key will be output to the log.A new config will be generated and stored under  /etc/wiretrustee/config.json\n       sudo wiretrustee up --log-level info   # orsudo wiretrustee up --log-level info  &amp;   # to run it in background\n         This will launch the Signal server on port 10000, in case you want to change the port, use the flag --port.\n  We have packed the Signal server into docker image.

If you don&#39;t already have an SSL certificate, you can follow  Certbot&#39;s official documentationto generate one from  Let\u2019s Encrypt, or, we found that the example provided by  BigBlueButton covers the basics to configure Coturn with Let&#39;s Encrypt certs.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u7f51\u72b6,wireguard,wiretrustee", "title": "WireTrustee\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eWioguard\u7684\u7f51\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc ", "title_en": "Wiretrustee: WireGuard-Based Mesh Network", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u7f51\u72b6", "wireguard"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068509, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86javascript\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd\uff06\uff0339;\u865a\u62dfDom\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u7684\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u793a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u6bd4\u771f\u6b63\u7684dom\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u56e0 - \u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u95ee\u4e86\u5728\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62dfDOM\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5feb\u901f\u5feb\u901f\u3002\n    \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u6e32\u67d3\uff08\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6b64\u7b80\u5355\u7684React\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\n    ...\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684 - \u4ee3\u8868\u9875\u9762\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u865a\u62dfDOM\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u60a8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff06\uff0339;

It&#39;s a surprisingly resilient meme \u2014 for example people have asked how Svelte can be fast when it doesn&#39;t use a virtual DOM.\n    In many frameworks, you build an app by creating  render() functions, like this simple  React component:\n    ...but the result is the same \u2014 an object representing how the page should now look. That object is the virtual DOM. Every time your app&#39;s state updates (for example when the  name prop changes), you create a new one. The framework&#39;s job is to  reconcile the new one against the old one, to figure out what changes are necessary and apply them to the real DOM.\n   Misunderstood claims about virtual DOM performance date back to the launch of React. In  Rethinking Best Practices, a seminal 2013 talk by former React core team member Pete Hunt, we learned the following:\n This is actually extremely fast, primarily because most DOM operations tend to be slow. There&#39;s been a lot of performance work on the DOM, but most DOM operations tend to drop frames.\n  But hang on a minute! The virtual DOM operations are  in addition to the eventual operations on the real DOM. The only way it could be faster is if we were comparing it to a less efficient framework (there were plenty to go around back in 2013!), or arguing against a straw man \u2014 that the alternative is to do something no-one actually does:\n   React is not magic. Just like you can drop into assembler with C and beat the C compiler, you can drop into raw DOM operations and DOM API calls and beat React if you wanted to. However, using C or Java or JavaScript is an order of magnitude performance improvement because you don&#39;t have to worry...about the specifics of the platform. With React you can build applications without even thinking about performance and the default state is fast.\n    Not exactly. It&#39;s more like &#39;the virtual DOM is usually fast enough&#39;, but with certain caveats.\n The original promise of React was that you could re-render your entire app on every single state change without worrying about performance. In practice, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s turned out to be accurate. If it was, there&#39;d be no need for optimisations like  shouldComponentUpdate (which is a way of telling React when it can safely skip a component).\n Even with  shouldComponentUpdate, updating your entire app&#39;s virtual DOM in one go is a lot of work. A while back, the React team introduced something called React Fiber which allows the update to be broken into smaller chunks. This means (among other things) that updates don&#39;t block the main thread for long periods of time, though it doesn&#39;t reduce the total amount of work or the time an update takes.\n   Most obviously,  diffing isn&#39;t free. You can&#39;t apply changes to the real DOM without first comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous snapshot. To take the earlier  HelloMessage example, suppose the  name prop changed from &#39;world&#39; to &#39;everybody&#39;.\n Both snapshots contain a single element. In both cases it&#39;s a  &lt;div&gt;, which means we can keep the same DOM node\n We enumerate all the attributes on the old  &lt;div&gt; and the new one to see if any need to be changed, added or removed. In both cases we have a single attribute \u2014 a  className with a value of  &#34;greeting&#34;\n Descending into the element, we see that the text has changed, so we&#39;ll need to update the real DOM\n Of these three steps, only the third has value in this case, since \u2014 as is the case in the vast majority of updates \u2014 the basic structure of the app is unchanged. It would be much more efficient if we could skip straight to step 3:\n  (This is almost exactly the update code that Svelte generates. Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Svelte is a compiler that knows at  build time how things could change in your app, rather than waiting to do the work at  run time.)\n   The diffing algorithms used by React and other virtual DOM frameworks are fast. Arguably, the greater overhead is in the components themselves. You wouldn&#39;t write code like this...\n  ...because you&#39;d be carelessly recalculating  value on every update, regardless of whether  props.foo had changed. But it&#39;s extremely common to do unnecessary computation and allocation in ways that seem much more benign:\n function  MoreRealisticComponent ( props )  {  const  [selected , setSelected ]  =  useState ( null ) ;  return  (  &lt;div &gt;  &lt;p &gt;Selected  {selected  ? selected .name  :  &#39;nothing&#39; } &lt; /p &gt;  &lt;ul &gt;  {props .items . map ( item  =&gt;  &lt;li &gt;  &lt;button onClick = { ( )  =&gt;  setSelected (item ) } &gt;  {item .name }  &lt; /button &gt;  &lt; /li &gt;  ) }  &lt; /ul &gt;  &lt; /div &gt;  ) ; }\n Here, we&#39;re generating a new array of virtual  &lt;li&gt; elements \u2014 each with their own inline event handler \u2014 on every state change, regardless of whether  props.items has changed. Unless you&#39;re unhealthily obsessed with performance, you&#39;re not going to optimise that. There&#39;s no point. It&#39;s plenty fast enough. But you know what would be even faster?  Not doing that.\n  The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to &#39;death by a thousand cuts&#39; with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it&#39;s time to optimise.\n    It&#39;s important to understand that virtual DOM  isn&#39;t a feature. It&#39;s a means to an end, the end being declarative, state-driven UI development. Virtual DOM is valuable because it allows you to build apps without thinking about state transitions, with performance that is  generally good enough. That means less buggy code, and more time spent on creative tasks instead of tedious ones.\n But it turns out that we can achieve a similar programming model without using virtual DOM \u2014 and that&#39;s where Svelte comes in.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:01:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u865a\u62df,dom", "title": "\u865a\u62dfDOM\u662f\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff082018\uff09 ", "title_en": "Virtual DOM is pure overhead (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u865a\u62df", "dom"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0cfce70aa621e219e9420dd61ad18913.png", "infoid": 1068508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51faGithub Copilot\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002 github copilot\u4ece\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7ed8\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6574\u884c\u6216\u6574\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0API\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5f53\u60a8\u952e\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7b26\u5408\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n GitHub Copilot\u4e0eOpenai\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7531Openai\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u7535\u3002 Openai Codex\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684GPT-3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u57f9\u8bad\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u5927\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002 GitHub Copilot\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u5bf9\u4e8ePython\uff0cJavaScript\uff0cCyperscript\uff0cRuby\u548cGo\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u3002\n \u5728GitHub CopIlot\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u7684\u6591\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4eca\u5929\u6ce8\u518c\uff01 ", "note_en": "Today, we are launching a technical preview of  GitHub Copilot, a new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code.

There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. Andyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when Iwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.  One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you&#39;llhave to work very hard. I wasn&#39;t sure of that as a kid. Schoolworkvaried in difficulty; one didn&#39;t always have to work super hard todo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed todo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hardwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.There isn&#39;t.  The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had lowstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do thingseffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.  Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural abilitytoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but todo the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot  and to be trying very hard.  [  1]  Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in businessin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. &#34;I nevertook a day off in my twenties,&#34; he said. &#34;Not one.&#34; It was similarwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youthcoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent buthis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probablyget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I hadto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no oneever worked harder. At 74, he wrote with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one&#39;s toes and makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases twenty times.\nSounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds evenmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had aboutas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they alsoworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.  That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hardto grasp. There&#39;s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comespartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, andpartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talentand great drive are both rare, then people with both are raresquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have lessof the other. But you&#39;ll need both if you want to be an outlieryourself. And since you can&#39;t really change how much natural talentyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reducesto working very hard.  It&#39;s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some techniqueto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, andnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of disciplineseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they wantit.  What I&#39;ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goalsthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You&#39;llprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.  The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be workingwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarmbells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m workinghard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and itfeels awful. [  2]  There wasn&#39;t a single point when I learned this. Like most littlekids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or didsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling ofdisgust when I wasn&#39;t achieving anything. The one precisely dateablelandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age\u00a013.  Several people I&#39;ve talked to remember getting serious about workaround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started tofind idleness distasteful, he said I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday.\nPerhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.  Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious aboutwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was beforeI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, becauseeven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entiredepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of realwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they&#39;dbeen made for each another.  I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they canlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in  A Mathematician&#39;sApology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any  passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively.\nHe didn&#39;t learn what math was really about till part way throughcollege, when he read Jordan&#39;s  Cours d&#39;analyse. I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant.\nThere are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn todiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kindHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they&#39;readapted to be taught to kids \u2014 often so distorted that they&#39;renothing like the work done by actual practitioners. [  3]The otherkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some typesof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.  There&#39;s a kind of solidity to real work. It&#39;s not all writing the Principia, but it all feels necessary. That&#39;s a vague criterion,but it&#39;s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot ofdifferent types. [  4]  Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how manyhours a day to spend on it. You can&#39;t solve this problem by simplyworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there&#39;s apoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.  That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.I&#39;ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits weredifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing orprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was runninga startup, I couldwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I&#39;dkept going much longer, I&#39;d probably have needed to take occasionalvacations. [  5]  The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate asensitivity to the quality of the work you&#39;re doing, and then you&#39;llnotice if it decreases because you&#39;re working too hard. Honesty iscritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you&#39;rebeing lazy, but also when you&#39;re working too hard. And if you thinkthere&#39;s something admirable about working too hard, get that ideaout of your head. You&#39;re not merely getting worse results, butgetting them because you&#39;re showing off \u2014 if not to other people,then to yourself. [  6]  Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work andyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to beconstantly judging both how hard you&#39;re trying and how well you&#39;redoing.  Trying hard doesn&#39;t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.There may be some people do who, but I think my experience is fairlytypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I&#39;mstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That&#39;swhen I&#39;m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, Itend to keep going.  What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was workingon Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinatedat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beastby doing it, why wait?  [  7]Whereas what drives me now, writingessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. Butonce I get started on one, I don&#39;t have to push myself to work,because there&#39;s always some error or omission already pushing me.  I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Manyproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuffat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to theextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you&#39;llonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you shouldalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.  The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of theseproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at thecenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones atthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved inworking on a specific problem, you&#39;ll occasionally have to makebig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward thecenter \u2014 toward the most ambitious problems.  By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the currentconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems aremost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specificfields. If you disagree with it, and you&#39;re right, that couldrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.  The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but althoughyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treatdifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If youdiscover some ambitious type of work that&#39;s a bargain in the senseof being easier for you than other people, either because of theabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you&#39;vefound to approach it, or simply because you&#39;re more excited aboutit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done bypeople who find an easy way to do something hard.  As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure outwhich kind you&#39;re suited for. And that doesn&#39;t just mean figuringout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn&#39;tmean that if you&#39;re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. Whatyou&#39;re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps evenmore on your interests. A   deep interest in a topic makes peoplework harder than any amount of discipline can.  It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start tobe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is asubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerfulsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you reallyinterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you&#39;ll makea lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,or because your parents want you to? [  8]  The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormouslyfrom one person to another. That&#39;s one of the most important thingsI&#39;ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get theimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do isfigure out what it is. That&#39;s how it works in movies, and in thestreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that wayin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children andjust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlesslyfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identifyone as their calling \u2014 we can wish Newton spent more time on mathand physics and less on alchemy and theology \u2014 but this is an  illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.  So while some people&#39;s lives converge fast, there will be otherswhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out whatto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoingpart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For thesepeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: alongwith measuring both how hard you&#39;re working and how well you&#39;redoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working inthis field or switch to another. If you&#39;re working hard but notgetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simpleexpressed that way, but in practice it&#39;s very difficult. You shouldn&#39;tgive up on the first day just because you work hard and don&#39;t getanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how muchtime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops goingwell? How much time do you give yourself then? [  9]  What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.If you&#39;re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may noteven know what good results look like. History is full of examplesof people who misjudged the importance of what they were workingon.  The best test of whether it&#39;s worthwhile to work on something iswhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerouslysubjective measure, but it&#39;s probably the most accurate one you&#39;regoing to get. You&#39;re the one working on the stuff. Who&#39;s in a betterposition than you to judge whether it&#39;s important, and what&#39;s abetter predictor of its importance than whether it&#39;s interesting?  For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.Indeed, that&#39;s the most striking thing about the whole question ofworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest withyourself.  Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It&#39;s a complicated,dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. Youhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kindyou&#39;re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as youcan, accurately judge at each moment both what you&#39;re capable ofand how you&#39;re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you canwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is toocomplicated to trick. But if you&#39;re consistently honest andclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, andyou&#39;ll be productive in a way few people are.             Notes  [  1]In &#34;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&#34; I said the three ingredientsin great work work were natural ability, determination, and interest.That&#39;s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interestyield practice and effort.  [  2]I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You&#39;ll oftenget somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution toa problem comes to you while taking a   shower, or even in your sleep,but only because you were working hard on it the day before.  It&#39;s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,I like to learn new things. I wouldn&#39;t like just sitting on a beach.  [  3]The thing kids do in school that&#39;s most like the real versionis sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games playedin schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactlywhat adults do.  In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretendingto do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.Arguably the latter is no worse.  [  4]Knowing what you want to work on doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be ableto. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on thingsthey don&#39;t want to, especially early on. But if you know what youwant to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.  [  5]The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution tothe problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switchto harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.  [  6]Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. Idon&#39;t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of somethingimportant and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doingthings that don&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t know enough to say for sure whetherit&#39;s net good or bad, but my guess is bad.  [  7]One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is thatstartups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be bothdecisive and conspicuous.  [  8]It&#39;s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You needto solve the money problem somehow, and there&#39;s nothing wrong withdoing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I supposeit would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you&#39;re conscious of yourmotivations. The thing to avoid is  unconsciously letting the needfor money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find mostinteresting.  [  9]Many people face this question on a smaller scale withindividual projects. But it&#39;s easier both to recognize and to accepta dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of workentirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like aSpanish Flu victim, you&#39;re fighting your own immune system: Insteadof giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And whocan say you&#39;re not right?
