Dagny searched Yelp to find the phone number for U.S. Private Vaults, a Beverly Hills facility where she&#39;d rented a safe deposit box since 2017. That&#39;s when she saw the bad news.</p><p> 她＆＃39; D由朋友询问，推荐方便和安全的位置，以保持一些贵重物品。 Dagny搜索了Yelp，找到了美国私人保险库的电话号码，这是一个贝弗利山庄设施，在那里她自2017年以来租用了一个保险箱。那个＆＃39;她看到坏消息时。</p><p>  After a brief moment of panic, some phone calls, and several days, Dagny and her husband Howard (pseudonyms used at their request to maintain privacy during ongoing legal proceedings) figured out what happened. On March 22, the FBI had raided U.S. Private Vaults. The federal agents were armed with a warrant allowing them to seize property belonging to the company as part of a criminal investigation—and even though the warrant explicitly exempted the safe deposit boxes in the company&#39;s vaults, they were taken too. More than 800 were seized.</p><p>  经过短暂的恐慌时刻，有些电话，以及几天，Dagny和她的丈夫霍华德（在正在进行的法律程序中用于保持隐私的假名）弄清楚发生了什么。 3月22日，联邦调查局袭击了美国私人保险库。联邦代理商武装有逮捕令，允许他们抓住该公司的财产，作为刑事调查的一部分 - 虽然逮捕令明确地豁免了公司的保管箱＆＃39; S＆＃39。超过800人被扣押。</p><p> Howard tells  Reason there was no attempt made by the FBI to contact him, his wife, or their heirs—despite the fact that contact information was taped to the top of their box. Six weeks later, the couple is still waiting for their property to be returned. (Both individuals are supporters of Reason Foundation, the nonprofit that publishes this website.)</p><p> 霍华德讲述了没有通过FBI与他联系，他的妻子或其继承者的尝试 - 尽管联系信息被录音到盒子的顶部。六周后，这对夫妇仍在等待他们的财产。 （两个人都是推理本网站的非营利组织的支持者。）</p><p> The FBI and federal prosecutors have &#34;no authority to continue holding the possessions of some 800 bystanders who are not alleged to have been involved in whatever USPV may have done wrong,&#34; Benjamin Gluck, a California attorney who is representing several of the people caught up in the FBI&#39;s raid of U.S. Private Vaults, tells  Reason.</p><p> 联邦调查局和联邦检察官有＆＃34;没有权力继续持有一些800名旁观者的财产，这些旁观者并没有被涉及到任何USPV可能做错了什么，＆＃34; Benjamin Grauck是一位代表其中几个人的加州律师，在FBI＆＃39;我们的美国私人保险库袭击中赶上了理由。</p><p> Legal efforts to force the FBI to return the items seized during the March 22 raid have so far been unsuccessful, but at least five lawsuits are pending in federal court.</p><p> 迫使联邦调查局返回3月22日突袭中缉获的物品的法律努力已经取消了不成功，但至少五项诉讼在联邦法院待定。</p><p> A federal grand jury indicted U.S. Private Vaults (USPV) on counts of conspiracy to distribute drugs, launder money, and avoid mandatory deposit reporting requirements.</p><p> 联邦大陪审团在统治毒品，洗钱和避免强制存款报告要求时，私人保险队（USPV）指责。 </p><p> In legal filings, federal prosecutors have admitted that &#34;some&#34; of the company&#39;s customers were &#34;honest citizens,&#34; but contend that &#34;the majority of the box-holders are criminals who used USPV&#39;s anonymity to hide their ill-gotten wealth.&#34;</p><p>在法律申请中，联邦检察官承认了＆＃34;一些＆＃34;公司＆＃39;客户＆＃34;诚实的公民，＆＃34;但争吵和＃34;大多数箱子持有人是使用uspv＆＃39;匿名的犯罪分子来隐藏他们的缺陷。＆＃34;</p><p> Whatever the original motivation for the raid, the FBI&#39;s seizure of hundreds of safe deposit boxes held by U.S. Private Vaults raises serious Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues. In order to have the contents of their boxes returned, federal authorities are asking owners to come forward, identify themselves, and describe their possessions. Some owners may be unwilling to do that—U.S. Private Vaults allowed anonymous rentals of safe-deposit boxes—while others may rightfully object to being subjected to the scrutiny of federal law enforcement when they have done nothing wrong.</p><p> 无论RAID的原始动机是什么，FBI＆＃39; S扣除了U.S.私人金库持有的数百个保险箱提出了严重的第四和第五修正案问题。为了让他们的盒子内容返回，联邦当局要求所有者前进，识别自己，并描述他们的财产。有些业主可能不愿意做到这一点。私人万座允许匿名租赁的保管箱 - 而其他人可能会让对象遭受联邦执法的审查，当他们做错了什么。</p><p> &#34;The constitution does not abide guilt by association,&#34; argues Robert Frommer, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian law firm, in  an op-ed published by  The Orange County Register.</p><p> ＆＃34;宪法并未遵守协会的内疚，＆＃34;罗伯特（Robert）律师是一个自由律师律师事务所的律师，在由橙县登记册发布的Op-eD中。</p><p> &#34;What the government has done here is completely backward,&#34; writes Frommer. &#34;The government cannot search every apartment in a building because the landlord is involved in a crime. After all, when somebody rents an apartment, that apartment is theirs.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;政府在这里完成的是完全落后的，＆＃34;写道。 ＆＃34;政府无法在建筑物中搜索每间公寓，因为房东涉及犯罪。毕竟，当有人租了一个公寓时，该公寓是他们的。＆＃34;</p><p> Indeed, the  unsealed warrant authorizing the raid of U.S. Private Vaults granted the FBI permission to seize the business&#39;s computers, money counters, security cameras, and &#34;nests&#34; of safe deposit boxes—the large steel frames that effectively act as bookshelves for the boxes themselves.</p><p> 实际上，未密封的逮捕令授权美国私人金库授权联邦调查局授权业务销售股票，金钱计数器，安全摄像机和＆＃34;巢和＃34;安全存款盒 - 大型钢框架，有效地作为盒子本身的书架。</p><p> Importantly, the warrant &#34;does not authorize a criminal search or seizure of the contents of the safe-deposit boxes,&#34; according to a copy of the warrant contained in court filings. The warrant also states that it &#34;authorize[s] the seizure of the nests of the boxes themselves, not their contents.&#34;</p><p> 重要的是，保证＆＃34;不授权犯罪搜索或扣押保管箱的内容，＆＃34;根据法院申请中的诉讼副本。逮捕令还指出它＆＃34;授权[S]扣押盒子本身的巢，而不是他们的内容。＆＃34;</p><p> But the FBI&#39;s own policies seem to have allowed a roundabout legal rationale for seizing the boxes as well. Agents are required to take into custody any property that could otherwise be stolen or left &#34;in a dangerous manner&#34; after carrying out a warrant. To put it in the context of a simpler situation: If the FBI seized a truck carrying cargo, it would not simply dump the cargo on the side of the road. Instead, there is a specific procedure for law enforcement to follow, which involves identifying and notifying rightful property owners, as well as securing the property.</p><p> 但是FBI＆＃39;自己的政策似乎允许环形交叉路口的法律理由抓住盒子。代理人必须拘留任何可能被盗或留下的财产或留下的财产;以危险的方式＆＃34;执行权证后。把它放在更简单的情况下：如果联邦调查局扣押卡车携带货物，那就不会简单地将货物倾倒在路边。相反，执法的具体程序遵循，这涉及识别和通知合理的财产所有者，并确保财产。 </p><p> In court filings, however, Gluck and other attorneys representing anonymous plaintiffs  argue that the seizure of the nests &#34;does not appear to be the government&#39;s  true purpose here.&#34;</p><p>然而，在法庭申请中，格鲁克和其他代表匿名原告的律师争辩说，巢穴＆＃34扣押;似乎不是政府＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> &#34;A reasonable person could easily conclude that taking and searching the  contents of the boxes was the true purpose of the USPV seizure, not just an unintended but unavoidable byproduct as the government seeks to portray and justify it,&#34; they  write.</p><p> ＆＃34;一个合理的人可以很容易地得出结论，采取和搜索框的内容是USPV癫痫发作的真正目的，而不仅仅是一个意外但不可避免的副产品，因为政府寻求描绘并证明它，＆＃34;他们写。</p><p> Now that the FBI has nearly 1,000 safe deposit boxes in its custody, anyone who comes forward to identify themselves and claim their possessions risks becoming the target of a criminal investigation. The U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Central District of California  told the  Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal industry publication, last month that &#34;each box is being considered on a case-by-case basis, and we will investigate the boxes, or claims made on them&#34; to determine if &#34;the contents are related to criminal activity.&#34;</p><p> 现在，联邦调查局在其监护下拥有近1,000个保险箱，任何向前识别自己并声称他们的财产风险成为刑事调查的目标。美国律师＆＃39;加州中部地区的办公室告诉洛杉矶每日期刊，是一个法律行业出版物，上个月＆＃34;每个盒子都在逐案中被考虑，我们将调查盒子，或在它们上制作的声明;确定＆＃34;内容与犯罪活动有关。＆＃34;</p><p> Attorneys for the plaintiffs  argue that this amounts to an admission that prosecutors intend &#34;to use any information gleaned in the claims process in order to conduct criminal investigations.&#34; U.S. Private Vaults had assured its customers that their anonymity would be protected, and people could have valid, non-criminal reasons for wanting to keep their identities a secret.</p><p> 原告的律师认为，这增加了检察官打算＆＃34的录取;使用索赔进程中收集的任何信息以进行刑事调查。＆＃34;美国私人保险库确保其客户，他们的匿名将受到保护，人们可能会有有效的，非刑事原因，希望保持其身份秘密。</p><p> The rights violations are bad enough, but the FBI raid seems to have had serious procedural shortcomings as well. One 80-year-old woman represented by Gluck—and identified in court documents only as &#34;Linda R.&#34;—may have lost a significant portion of her life savings due to what legal filings say are shoddy inventories of the safe deposit boxes&#39; contents.</p><p> 侵权行为足够糟糕，但FBI突袭似乎也有严重的程序缺点。一个80岁的女子由Gluck-of Court-officons签名，只有＆＃34;＆＃34;  - ＆＃34;  - 原因，由于法律申请是什么是伪劣库存的伪造库存保险箱＆＃39;内容。</p><p> In  a lawsuit filed on April 26, Linda R.&#39;s attorneys argue that the FBI &#34;failed to account for or return&#34; 40 gold coins worth an estimated $75,000 that had been stored in a safe deposit box housed at U.S. Private Vaults. Department of Justice  documentation detailing the contents of Linda&#39;s box makes note of &#34;miscellaneous coins&#34; without any specific amounts or other identification of the coins—Linda&#39;s attorneys  note that the description could apply to everything from a pair of pennies to a box full of 1933 double eagle gold coins, some of the rarest and most valuable coins ever minted. For now, it remains unclear whether the government even possesses an accurate accounting of what was in her safe deposit box when it was seized.</p><p> 在4月26日提交的诉讼中，琳达R.＆＃39; S律师争辩说FBI＆＃34;未能考虑或返回＆＃34; 40个金币价值估计为75,000美元，已存放在私人保险库的保险箱中。律法文献系详细描述了Linda＆＃39; s盒的内容，记下＆＃34;杂项硬币＆＃34;没有任何特定金额或其他识别硬币 - 琳达＆＃39;律师的律师注意到，该描述可以从一副便士到一个充满1933年双鹰金币的盒子，一些最稀有和最有价值的硬币薄荷。目前，仍然不清楚政府甚至在被扣押时准确会计安全存款盒中的准确会计。</p><p> Despite the broad claims of criminality from prosecutors, Linda has been charged with no crimes but may have lost tens of thousands of dollars of her retirement savings anyway. Even if the FBI&#39;s raid of U.S. Private Vaults eventually uncovers criminal activity relating to some of the safe-deposit boxes stored there, that hardly seems to justify the potential losses incurred by innocent bystanders like Linda, who kept her retirement savings there because she distrusted the banking system, according to court filings.</p><p> 尽管对检察官的刑事主义的广泛索赔，但琳达已被指控没有犯罪，但无论如何都可能失去了数万美元的退休储蓄。即使FBI＆＃39;我们的私人金库最终揭开了与那里的一些保管箱有关的犯罪活动，这几乎似乎是依附于Linda这样的无辜旁观者所产生的潜在损失，他们将退休储蓄储蓄在那里保持良好因为据法院申请，她不信任银行系统。 </p><p> &#34;It was improper that the government seized these possessions in the first place, unconscionable that they are using them as hostages to pressure owners to divulge private information, and outrageous that they apparently treated the possessions so carelessly that they seem to have lost at least some of them,&#34; Gluck tells  Reason.</p><p>＆＃34;政府首先扣押这些财产是不合适的，不合情理为他们将它们作为人质到压力所有者透露私人信息，并且令人遗憾的是，他们显然非常粗心地对待财产，他们似乎似乎已经丢失了至少有些人，＆＃34;格鲁克讲述了理由。</p><p> Jeffrey B. Isaacs, an attorney for another anonymous customer of U.S. Private Vaults—identified in court records as &#34;James Poe&#34;— tells the  Los Angeles Times that the FBI&#39;s raid is &#34;as illegal a search and seizure as I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;</p><p> jeffrey b. isaacs是一个匿名客户的律师，用于美国私人金库的另一个匿名客户 - 在法庭记录中鉴定为＆＃34;詹姆斯Poe＆＃34;  - 告诉洛杉矶时代FBI＆＃39; raid是＆＃34;如非法搜索和扣押，因为我见过。＆＃34;</p><p> For Dagny and Howard, the situation seems particularly cruel. They&#39;d rented the box at U.S. Private Vaults after having their home burgled several years ago. They have the key and rental agreement for the box—and, Howard notes, they paid for the box with a credit card, hardly the sort of thing you&#39;d do if you were trying to hide your identity from the feds or engage in criminal conduct. None of that has made a difference so far.</p><p> 对于Dagny和霍华德，情况似乎特别残忍。他们＆＃39; d在几年前的房屋击败后租用了美国私人金库的盒子。他们拥有盒子的关键和租赁协议 - 而且，他们为带信用卡的盒子支付的盒子，几乎没有那种，如果你试图隐藏你的身份或从事你的身份，那就做了那种。在犯罪行为中。到目前为止，这都不是差异。</p><p>  Editor&#39;s Note: We invite comments and request that they be civil and on-topic.

A couple of years ago the NYT had an article “Safe Deposit Boxes Aren’t Safe When Philip Poniz opened Box 105 at his local Wells Fargo, he discovered it was empty — and that he was totally unprotected by federal law.” Of course, when it’s the feds who take your stuff, you’re really screwed.</p><p>这是特别可怕的，但安全的存款盒根本不安全。几年前，NYT有一篇文章“菲利普·佩斯在他当地的井法戈开箱105时，安全存款盒不安全，他发现它是空的 - 并且他完全受联邦法律的保护。”当然，当它是拿走你的东西的美联储时，你真的搞砸了。</p><p>  Her name is Dagny? You people are soooooooo weird. She probably waited her whole life for “gubmint overreach” so she could bitch and moan and whine and cry and sob……..Sad when your whole existence is based on terribly written junk philosophy.</p><p>  她的名字是叫话吗？你们的人很奇怪。她可能会等待她的一生为“gubmint overrace”，所以她可以婊子和呻吟，呜咽和哭泣和呜咽......当你的整个存在是基于非常写的垃圾哲学时。</p><p>  I would like to see original reporting on this from reason, as we have seen in days past.</p><p>  正如我们在过去的日子里看到的那样，我想从原因看原因原因。</p><p>  The allegations in this article are already enough to convict government agents of criminal and civil violations, if true.</p><p>  如果是，这篇文章中的指控已经足以让刑事和民事侵犯的政府代理商犯罪。</p><p>  But we never see from these sorts of cases is perspective from the courts, ancillary people involved, agents on the ground, the sort of sources who know things about what is really going on and how it is affecting people.</p><p>  但是，我们从未从这些案件中看到的是从法院的角度来看，辅助人员参与，代理人在地上，这些来源是关于真正发生的事情以及如何影响人们的来源。</p><p>  We get statements from FBI spokesman, or US attorneys, or rulings from the judge, but none of these people given depth interviews. Particularly absent are the judges. They always sit up on high, pretending that their opinions are not personal but are empirical analysis of the law, unquestionable outside of the realm of the appeals courts. There have to be clerks who would be willing to talk to somebody on background.</p><p>  我们从FBI发言人或美国律师或来自法官的裁决获得了陈述，但这些人都没有给予深度访谈。特别缺席是法官。他们总是坐在高位，假装他们的意见并不是个人的，而是对法律的实证分析，毫无疑问，在上诉法院的领域之外。必须有职员愿意与背景上的人交谈。</p><p>  I really would love to hear what people think as they are in the midst of doing people this great harm.</p><p>  我真的很想听到人们认为是在做人们的危害中的伤害。 </p><p>  I was accidentally privy to some of these sorts of things during the Little Rascals daycare moral panic. Through friend of a friend type connections I heard from a highly ranked judge in North Carolina and from a prosecutor who took on the case after the fact. Their thoughts were very informative.</p><p>在小流氓日托道德恐慌期间，我不小心刺势了一些这些东西。通过朋友的朋友类型连接，我从北卡罗来纳州的一位高度排名法官中听到的，并从一个案件之后从案件中获得的检察官。他们的想法非常丰富。</p><p>  The high-ranking judge basically washed his hands like Pontius Pilate. The way the courts work, they can’t choose their cases and they have to wait for a case to come before them. So even though it was patently obvious to anyone on the outside that these people were getting railroaded into life sentences despite having done absolutely nothing wrong, this judge slept soundly at night knowing that although he had the power to overturn the whole thing, it was not his responsibility until the case was before him.</p><p>  高级法官基本上像Pontius Pilate一样洗手。法院工作的方式，他们不能选择他们的案件，他们必须等待在他们面前出现案件。所以即使它对外面的任何人显然是显而易见的，这些人仍然没有做错了句子，尽管做出了绝对没有错，这位法官在夜间睡了很大，知道虽然他有能力推翻整个东西，但不是他的责任直到他面前。</p><p>  The prosecutor who later took over the case during the appeals process was also informative. Just a preface things, to me it is blindingly obvious that every allegation was completely made up out of whole cloth. You have to go watch the frontline documentaries or do a bunch of reading to reach that point if you don’t know anything about it, but suffice it to say that despite allegations of extreme sexual abuse of toddlers, including rape with butcher knives, there was never any physical evidence. In the allegations were so fantastical as to be entirely unbelievable. The documentaries present a solid theory as to exactly why these allegations were brought forward, a theory having absolutely nothing to do with anything being done to the children.</p><p>  后来在上诉过程中接管的检察官也是有信息。只是一个前言事情，对我来说，这很明显，每一个指控都是完全由整布制成的。如果您对其一无所知，您必须去观看前线纪录片或做一堆阅读以达到那个点，但这就是说，尽管有针对幼儿的极端性虐待的指控，那么在那里有屠夫刀强奸从来没有任何身体证据。在指控中是如此奇妙，完全令人难以置信。纪录片呈现了一个稳定的理论，即提出了为什么这些指控提出，这是一个绝对与孩子所做的任何事情无关的理论。</p><p>  In any event, the follow-on prosecutor was absolutely convinced that they were guilty. She kept pursuing the appeals and pursuing new prosecutions for years, despite it being almost impossible to justify as a rational human being. I found that to be very informative as well. Because I am going to take it as an article of faith that she is not a demonic creature but rather a well-meaning human being. This means that there were psychological forces at play that caused her to believe something that was wholly unbelievable. (Where have we seen that lately?)</p><p>  无论如何，后续检察官绝对相信他们有罪。她一直追求上诉并追求新的起诉多年来，尽管它几乎不可能是理性的人权。我发现这也是非常富有信息的。因为我将作为一篇信仰的文章，因为她不是一个恶魔生物，而是一个伟大的人类。这意味着在比赛中有心理力量导致她相信一些完全难以置信的东西。 （我们最近看过哪里？）</p><p>  I was just a kid and didn’t have a platform, so I wasn’t able to use those tidbits of knowledge to shape an article. I would really love to see cases like those covered by Radley Balko when he was at reason or this case given the deep dive treatment where we see other perspectives and dig into the justifications that people give themselves.</p><p>  我只是一个孩子，没有一个平台，所以我无法使用那些知识的tidbits来塑造文章。我真的很乐意看到克莱利·鲍克罗所涵盖的案件，当他原因或如此案例给出了深度潜水治疗，我们看到其他观点并挖掘人们给自己的理由。</p><p>  but contend that “the majority of the box-holders are criminals who used USPV’s anonymity to hide their ill-gotten wealth.”</p><p>  但是，“大多数箱子持有人是犯罪分子，犯罪分子是利用uspv的匿名来隐藏他们的不良财富。”</p><p>  Another reason to get rid of qualifies immunity for all government workers.
