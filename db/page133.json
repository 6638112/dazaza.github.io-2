The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.\n   Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best \u2014 the ones who bet on you earlier than others \u2014 are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn\u2019t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.\n Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator  changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.\n \u201cWe have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,\u201d the  accelerator wrote in a post then. \u201cIn addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.\n \u201cSaid simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668,accelerators,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u542f\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u5668''\u503c\u6dfb\u52a0'\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\u5237\u65b0", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tStartup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a0\u901f\u5668", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e306d0d4b5502e34e4dd43d93da7faae.jpg", "infoid": 1072510, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2020\u5e744\u6708\uff0cNextview VC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u539a\u5b9e\u4e2d\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u800cy\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u548c500\u540d\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u5386\u53f2\u5b75\u5316\u5668\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u6279\u6b21\u5b8c\u5168\u9065\u8fdc\u548c\u6284\u5199\u961f\u5458\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u8c03\u6574\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5077\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u9884\u5148\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\nNextview\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u53d1\u5c04\u623f\u5b50\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u6837\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u8d8a\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff1a\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cBankaya\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaCeo Mauricio Cordero\uff0cRam\u00f3nChedraui\u548c\u8fed\u6208\u00b7\u74e6\u5c14\u52a0\u65af\u58f0\u79f0\u4ed6\u4eec\u964d\u843d\u4e8645\u4e07\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u542f\u52a8\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "note_en": "In April 2020,  NextView VC launched its debut accelerator in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.\n Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator  is launching its third cohort with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.\n  The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh\u2019s perspective is that the cash will \u201carm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.\u201d Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups \u2014 which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.\n \u201cIt just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,\u201d she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.\n Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they\u2019re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders  more activation energy when they need it most.\n And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThe way we engage with every company is \u2026 \u2018OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,\u2019 so we don\u2019t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.\u201d\n NextView isn\u2019t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.\n Even in a world where  capital is a commodity, investors are preparing \u2014 perhaps even more so \u2014 to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. \u201cValue add\u201d chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they\u2019re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That\u2019s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.\n For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column:  Startup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh.\n In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll dig into CES 2022 trends, a fintech startup with a contrarian view on CAC and a feature on the future of Black Girls Code. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter  @nmasc_ \u00a0or listen to me and my friends on  Equity.\n   From  smart cat collars to  color-changing cars, CES never fails to surprise us. While the TechCrunch team chose to cover the annual tech conference remotely due to surging COVID-19 cases, our reporters were all over the latest and greatest technology sneak peeks nonetheless. All of our CES coverage  can be found at this nifty link, but I recommend starting with Brian Heater\u2019s  CES 2022 themes just to wet your palate.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Stand out announcements so far include BMW\u2019s plan  to turn cars into rolling cinemas, a  mission to scale paper-based tooth brushes and, on a more serious note, a statement on the  importance of a cushion that tracks your child\u2019s temperature.\u200b\u200b\n     Bankaya! As our own Mary Ann Azevedo reports, this Mexican fintech is opting for a non-traditional strategy when it comes to acquiring customers: going offline. The new, early-stage company is targeting 50 million underbanked individuals with face-to-face advertising: think street sales and debit card kiosks strategically placed in vaccination centers.\n Here\u2019s what to know:  Just one year after launch, Bankaya co-founders CEO Mauricio Cordero, Ram\u00f3n Chedraui and Diego Vargas claim they landed 450,000 customers. And, adding to their counterintuitive strategy, the company is fully bootstrapped to date.\n     Over the holidays, news broke that Black Girls Code co-founder and  CEO Kimberly Bryant was \u201csuspended indefinitely\u201d from the nonprofit organization she launched nearly a decade ago. I spoke to the nonprofit board that decided to place her on leave, former employees who allege rising tensions between Bryant and the organization, and of course, Bryant herself to get the full story.\n Here\u2019s what to know: There\u2019s too much nuance in this story to sum it all up in a perfect blurb, so I\u2019d really recommend those interested  to read the entire story. As of now, the board claims it has formed a special committee to review complaints against Bryant from former and current employees and put Bryant on paid administrative leave last week \u201cto ensure a full and fair review process.\u201d\n    Our events calendar got leaked (by us) so now\u2019s your chance to  check out our legendary line up for this year. I\u2019m so excited to share that TechCrunch Disrupt, our flagship event, will be returning as an in-person event. Three days, a lot of startup chatter, and over-caffeination.

Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are the current weapons of choice, driving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to embrace crypto as an  investable asset class.\n Bitcoin has witnessed  strong year-to-date returns, outshining traditional hedges by  rallying over 130% compared to gold\u2019s meager 4%. In addition, increased  institutional adoption, sustained appetite for digital assets based on  weekly inflows\u00a0and growing exposure in the media strengthened bitcoin\u2019s case among weary investors.\n  If these are the moves being made by big money, they must be smart moves. However, while the prospect of hedging against bitcoin may seem enticing to retail investors, certain lingering question marks remain over its viability in mitigating financial risk for individuals.\n  The ongoing discussion of bitcoin as an inflation hedge needs to be prefaced with the fact that the currency is often susceptible to market jitters and gyrations: Bitcoin\u2019s value plummeted over  80% during December 2017, by  50% in March 2020 and by another  53% in May 2021.\n Bitcoin\u2019s ability to improve user returns and reduce volatility over the long term has yet to be proven. Traditional hedges like gold have  demonstrated efficacy in preserving purchasing power during periods of sustained high inflation \u2014 take the U.S.  during the 1970s as an example \u2014 something bitcoin has yet to be tested on. This increased risk, in turn, makes returns subject to the drastic short-term swings that sometimes affect the currency.\n  Many make the argument for bitcoin based on the fact that it\u2019s designed for a limited supply, which supposedly protects it from devaluation compared to traditional fiat currencies. While this makes sense in theory, bitcoin\u2019s price has been shown to be vulnerable to external influences. Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d are known for their ability to manipulate prices by selling or buying in large quantities, meaning that bitcoin can be dictated by speculative forces, not solely the money-supply rule.\n Another key consideration is regulation: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still at the mercy of regulators and wildly varying laws across jurisdictions. Anti-competitive laws and shortsighted regulations could significantly hamper the adoption of the underlying technology, potentially depreciating the asset\u2019s price further. All this is to say one thing: It\u2019s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.\n  Against the background of this debate, another salient trend has been driving its momentum. As bitcoin\u2019s popularity grows, it continues to drive adoption and institutionalization of the currency among consumers, including several wealthy individuals and corporations.\n A recent survey found that  72% of U.K. financial advisers have briefed their clients about investing in crypto, with nearly half of the advisers saying they believed crypto could be used to diversify portfolios as an uncorrelated asset.\n  There has also been a great deal of bitcoin advocacy from prolific individuals, known for being technologically progressive, namely billionaire Wall Street investor  Paul Tudor, Twitter CEO  Jack Dorsey,  the Winklevoss twins and  Mike Novogratz. Even powerful companies such as  Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley have expressed their interest in bitcoin as a viable asset.\n If this momentum continues, bitcoin\u2019s infamous volatility will gradually dissipate as more and more wealthy people and institutions hold the currency. Ironically, this accrual of value on the network would lead to the concentration of wealth \u2014 the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for, subject to the influence of the elite and exclusive  1%.\n In line with classical schools of financial thought, this would actually expose retail investors to greater risk, as institutional buying and selling would resemble whale-like market manipulations.\n  Bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity will no doubt lead to more people owning it, and one can argue that the people with the most money will be the ones who are going to (as usual) end up owning most of it.\n This noticeable shift of influence toward ultra-high-net-worth individuals and firms among bitcoin and other crypto circles goes against the very ethos that the Bitcoin white paper was based upon when it described a  peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n Among the  fundamental rationales for cryptocurrencies is their need to be permissionless and  resistant to censorship and control by any given institution.\n Now, as the 1% seeks a greater slice of the crypto pie, they boost the prices of these assets in the short term in a way that traditional and less influential retail investors are unable to.\n While this move would undoubtedly make a few wealthier, there is an argument to be made that this might leave the market at the mercy of the 1%, contradicting Bitcoin\u2019s intended vision.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u7535\u529b,richer,\u8d27\u5e01", "title": "\u5bcc\u88d5\u7684\u5bcc\u4eba\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u7535\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u51b2", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThe rich get richer: Rethinking Bitcoin\u2019s power as an inflation hedge\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/the-rich-get-richer-rethinking-bitcoins-power-as-an-inflation-hedge/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u7535\u529b", "richer", "\u8d27\u5e01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b43f57bd875f3c24ccf6fb98d5d35168.jpg", "infoid": 1072508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u60f3\u8981 - \u5e76\u671f\u671b - \u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u5c06\u52a0\u8f7dWhiz-Band\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u3002 CES 2022\u5305\u88f9\u672c\u5468\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6c7d\u8f66\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u535a\u4e16\u8868\u793a\u9884\u8ba1\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u5e74\u589e\u957f\u7387\u76f4\u81f32030\u5e74;\u677e\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u773c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u62ac\u5934\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u62e5\u67091000\u74e6\u548c25\u4e2a\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u7684ELS Studio 3D\u97f3\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9d\u9a6c\u63ed\u5f00\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e1a\u4e3b\u6539\u53d8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5e76\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u663e\u793a\u6570\u5b57\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u7f6e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u540e31\u82f1\u5bf8\u5267\u9662\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\n\u6839\u636eFisher\uff0cCR 2021\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u7aef\u7535\u52a8SUV\u662f\u6700\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u3002\n\u8d1d\u5c14\u5728Apple\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4e86\u8fd117\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u62db\u52df\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684Lucid Tech\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7b7e\u8ba2\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5411\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u953b\u70bc\u3002 \u201c\u4f60\u4e0d\u80fd\u8015\u79cd\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5728Lucid\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eceTier Whatevers\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u505a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u3002\u201d\n\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u6e34\u671b\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u6d88\u5931\u3002 Edmunds\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8463\u4e8b\u6770\u897f\u5361\u8003\u5fb7\u5a01\u5c14\uff08Edmunds\uff09\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u5361\u8f66\u5439\u6367\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u7528\u9014\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e70\u5bb6\u90fd\u5f88\u611f\u6fc0\u3002", "note_en": "Surveys show that consumers want \u2014 and expect \u2014 that their next car will be laden with whiz-bang features, demand that is a driver for the current bloat. CES 2022, which wrapped this week, provides a glimpse of what the future car might hold. Bosch said to expect double-digit annual growth in automotive software until 2030; Panasonic showed off an augmented reality head-up display with eye tracking, plus the ELS Studio 3D audio system with 1,000 watts and 25 speakers. BMW unveiled future technology that will allow owners to change the exterior color of their cars and display digital art inside them, not to mention a rear 31-inch Theatre Screen with  built-in Amazon Fire TV.\n And that\u2019s just a tiny sampling of the  car tech shown at CES 2022.\n  But if that tech is unreliable \u2014 as some of it has proven \u2014 then it\u2019s not a win for consumers. Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have a chip shortage; we have software bloat,\u201d said Mike Juran, CEO and co-founder of Altia, which provides graphical user interface design and tools to many automakers. \u201cThere is way too much unnecessary software out there.\u201d\n Take the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid had more than 10 million lines of code when it was introduced for the 2011 model year; \u00a0today\u2019s mid- to high-level vehicles have something like 100 million lines, said Michael Hill, vice president of engineering at Altia.\n \u201cIt\u2019s at the level you might have seen in a jet fighter 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Hill told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd there is no bug-free software.\u201d\n   \u201cToday\u2019s cars are being burdened with features consumers aren\u2019t necessarily asking for or demanding,\u201d Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports told TechCrunch.\n According to Fisher,  CR\u2019s 2021 Auto Reliability Report found that high-end electric SUVs are among the least-reliable vehicles.\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because their powertrains are problematic,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cInstead, automakers saw an opening with the early EV adopters to package the cars with all the technology they could come up with. They\u2019re trying to differentiate the product\u2013and justify the high cost. And that results in cars that aren\u2019t very reliable.\u201d\n Buggy software caused by inefficiency and coding problems are being driven by a shift \u2014 or more accurately, an acceleration \u2014 in the vehicle development cycle, according to Jason Williamson, vice president of marketing at Altia.\n \u201cPeople are used to seeing new phones every year, and automakers are trying to keep up with consumer electronics,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing to develop completely new cars in two years or less. And that means using building blocks that are maybe intended for laptops and not necessarily custom-built for automotive applications.\u201d\n It\u2019s not only expensive EVs that are enticing consumers with tech; it\u2019s happening in many mid- and upscale product lines.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more feature bloat than software bloat,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights. \u201cThe software is only there to make all the features work, and do we really need 30-way power adjustable seats with five massage-pattern options? Or sequential taillights, multi-zone automatic climate control and audio systems with concert hall and studio settings? The insatiable desire to one-up the competition is what\u2019s driving this.\u201d\n   \u201cThe hardest thing is to figure out what the feature set should be and stick to it,\u201d said Mike Bell, senior vice president of digital at Lucid Group. \u201cIt can be easier to say, \u2018We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re doing, so we\u2019re just going to throw in the whole kitchen sink.\u2019 The smart approach is to decide what customers actually want to do, then figure out how to give them the best experience. There shouldn\u2019t be seven ways to do something.\u201d\n Bell spent nearly 17 years at Apple, and recruited part of his Lucid tech team from there. He said one source of problems is that, contrary to tech company norms, automakers contract much of their software work out to suppliers. \u201cYou can\u2019t farm it out and expect to have a good experience,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Lucid, instead of buying from the tier whatevers, we do our own software and our own integration.\u201d\n  \u201cLaunching a car now is not just about the hardware, but about the software, too\u201d according to Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.\u00a0 He added in an interview that the ability to do over-the-air updates of that software \u201cmakes a big difference in consumer satisfaction. We can quickly respond to issues that come up.\u201d\n  A major factor here is consumer expectations. It\u2019s true that auto buyers don\u2019t need certain features, but they do appear to want them. A November  study from CoPilot, a data-driven car-buying app, suggests that automakers are simply responding to public demand. It found that 65.7% of current lease holders expect better feature functionality in their next car or truck, and slightly more than 56% think they\u2019ll pay about the same or less than they do for their current vehicle.\n Similarly, a September  CarMax survey of more than 1,000 car owners found that almost 50% \u201csaid they wish their current car had more tech features.\u201d\n Buyers in their 20s and 30s, a highly desirable demographic for automakers, were the most likely to say that tech features were \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as a purchase consideration. Overall, 15.9% considered the tech package extremely important; 36.7% saw it as very important; and 31.8% were in the \u201csomewhat important\u201d camp. Only 3.9% said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d important.\n  Pat Ryan, CEO and founder of CoPilot, said in an interview that consumers are likely on a collision course in three areas. \u201cFirst, it may take three to six months just to get a car, and people aren\u2019t used to that,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe second issue is that shoppers may find that their new car actually has fewer features than the one they\u2019re turning in.\n Premium sound, wireless charging, even heated seats may not be available because of the chip shortage. And people used to paying maybe 95% of the sticker price may find themselves hit with stickerplus.\u201d\n But the desire for high-tech cars is not likely to go away. Jessica Caldwell, executive director, Insights, at Edmunds, told TechCrunch that automakers are touting their cars and trucks as multi-purpose offices and living spaces on wheels, and buyers are appreciative.\n \u201cConsumers are enjoying the growing number of features and amenities, and most importantly are willing to pay for these highly contented vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chip shortage has made it challenging to produce models with more options and features, but the consumer interest is still there. And as long as there\u2019s a consumer appetite, automakers will find a way to feed it for the sake of their own profits and market share.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:14:39", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u82af\u7247,\u81a8\u80c0,bloat,\u6c7d\u8f66", "title": "\u201c\u529f\u80fd\u81a8\u80c0\u201d\u5982\u4f55\u63a8\u52a8\u82af\u7247\u77ed\u7f3a", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow \u2018feature bloat\u2019 is driving the chip shortage\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/feature-bloat-cars-chip-shortage/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82af\u7247", "\u81a8\u80c0", "bloat", "\u6c7d\u8f66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4d1a26bc86ee04dce7173178f011d939.jpg", "infoid": 1072507, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u7740\u9646\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u89c2\u770b\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u7535\u89c6\u53f0\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u9891\u9053\u7684\u76f4\u64ad\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5373\u5c06\u4e3e\u529e\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u95fb\u7b80\u62a5\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u7740\u9646\u3002", "note_en": "NASA launches, landings, and events.
