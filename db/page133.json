Their product analyzes public blockchain information across some 90 million Ethereum wallets to clue users into evolving opportunities.\n \u201cNansen\u2019s high-quality data enables investors to follow where the smart money is moving, where influential investors are taking positions as well as for discovering new projects to invest and perform due diligence,\u201d Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik tells TechCrunch in an email.\n  The startup just closed a $12 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which recently unveiled a whopping $2.2 billion crypto fund designed to bankroll the firm\u2019s crypto land grab. Other investors in the round include Coinbase Ventures, Skyfall Ventures, imToken Ventures, Mechanism Capital and QCP Capital.\n Nansen\u2019s primary product is a network of dashboards designed around specific verticals in the crypto space.\n Beyond the very hot DeFi space, Nansen is tapping their labeled database to find investor opportunities in yield farming, liquidity pools, DEX data, and even helping traders scout out particularly hot NFT collections. One of its popular dashboards called \u201cToken God Mode\u201d allows investors to tap into blockchain data on a particular ERC20 token, witnessing movement across exchanges over time as well as notable transactions across individual wallets.\n  As the crypto industry largely aims to bring more retail investors into its fold, Nansen\u2019s pricing showcases an effort to bring in a fairly wide range of customers. The startup sells a $116 per month package designed to help traders tap into real-time analytics across a variety of market indicators, while also shopping a $2,500 per month plan designed to foster a closer relationship with more bespoke support access including weekly calls, exclusive chat groups and vertical-specific information sessions.\n The team has been publishing some of its higher-level data  publicly on its site, but saves the more granular up-to-the-moment data for its network of paying customers.

Today, there are over 6,000 publicly available apps across the Shopify App Store, and on average, a merchant will use around six apps to run their business.\n Now, Shopify says it will drop its commissions on app developer revenue to 0%, down from 20%, for developers who make less than $1 million annually on its platform. This benchmark will also reset annually, giving developers \u2014 and, particularly those on the cusp of $1 million \u2014 more earning potential. And when Shopify\u2019s revenue share kicks in, it will now only be 15% of \u201cmarginal\u201d revenue. That means developers will pay 15% only on revenue they make that\u2019s over the $1 million mark.\n  The same business model will apply to Shopify\u2019s Theme Store, which opens to developer submissions July 15.\n As the two stores are separate entities, the $1 million revenue share metric applies to each store individually. The new business model will begin on August 1, 2021 and will be made available to developers who register by providing their account details in their partner dashboard.\n Shopify says the more developer-friendly business model will mean a drop in company revenue, but says it doesn\u2019t expect this impact \u201cto be material\u201d because it will encourage greater innovation and development.\n The changes to Shopify\u2019s App Store follow a shift in the broader app store market around developer commissions.\n Last year, amid increased\u00a0 regulatory\u00a0 scrutiny\u00a0over how it runs its App Store, Apple\u00a0 announced\u00a0it would reduce the App Store commissions for smaller businesses under a new program where developers earning up to $1 million per year would only have to pay a 15% commission on in-app purchases.  Google and  Amazon have since followed suit, each with their own particular spin on the concept. For example, in Google\u2019s case, the fee is 15% on the first million the developer earns. Amazon is still charging a higher percentage at 20%, but is tacking on AWS credits as a perk.\n Apple and Google, in particular, hope these changes can help shield them from antitrust investigations over their alleged app store monopolies, while also giving developers a better reason to participate in their own slice of the app economy.\n Outside of mobile, Microsoft this year agreed to  match the 12% cut on game sales that Epic Games takes on its Windows Store, as a means of increasing the pressure on its rivals. With the larger update to the new Windows 11 Store, it will allow developers to  use their own payment platforms, while keeping its commission at 15% on apps.\n To date, much of the momentum in the market has been focused on lowering the cut of app and games sales. Shopify\u2019s app platform is different \u2014 it\u2019s about apps that are used to enhance an e-commerce business, like those that help with shipping and delivery, marketing, merchandising, store design, customer service and more. These are not consumer-facing apps, but they are\u00a0 still \u00a0 marketed in an app store environment.\n While the changes to developers\u2019 businesses is the big news today from Unite 2021, that\u2019s not to diminish from the host of updates Shopify announced related to its larger platform.\n Among the updates are: the debut of\u00a0Online Store 2.0, a more flexible and customizable update to Shopify\u2019s Liquid platform (its  templating language), which  Netflix was the first to test; investments in custom storefronts for faster response times; a new React framework for building custom storefronts called Hydrogen; a way to host Hydrogen storefronts on Shopify called Oxygen; support for more Metafields for products and product variants and custom content that\u2019s built on top; speedier Spotify Checkout; Checkout Extensions (customizations built by developers); easier and more powerful Shopify Scripts; a Payments Platform for integrating third-party payment gateways into Checkout; updates to its Storefront API; and more.\n The company today also shared a few more business metrics, noting, for instance, that last year over 450 million people checked out on Shopify, totaling $120 billion in gross merchandise volume. It said its Shopify partners \u2014 which include app developers, theme builders, designers, agencies and experts \u2014 earned $12.5 billion in revenue in 2020, up 84% year-over-year, and 4x the revenue of Shopify\u2019s own platform.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:47:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,app,drops,\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title": "Shopify\u5c06\u5176App Store\u4f63\u91d1\u5220\u9664\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u6536\u5165\u76840\uff05 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tShopify drops its App Store commissions to 0% on developers\u2019 first million in revenue\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/shopify-drops-its-app-store-commissions-to-0-on-developers-first-million-in-revenue/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "app", "drops", "\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "de28ee5ab18e90c5fb4226bcf7b36542.jpg", "infoid": 1068703, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Life360\u5728\u4e24\u5e74\u524d\u4e0a\u5e02\u81ea\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\uff08ASX\uff09\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6e\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u6709\u5173\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u5229\u76ca\u6538\u5173\u65b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5229\u76ca\u6538\u5173\u65b9\u4e5f\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u5173\u6ce8Life360\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u8ffd\u8e2a1100\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728195\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5730\u533a\u8d85\u8fc72800\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u622a\u81f32021\u5e743\u6708\uff0c916,000\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u6b63\u5728\u4e3aLife360\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\n Life360\u8bf4\uff0cCeleb\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4e0eLife360\u4e00\u8d77\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u5bb6\u5ead\u54a8\u8be2\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff0c\u8be5\u54a8\u8be2\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c06\u501f\u9274\u987e\u95ee\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5851\u9020\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002\n  \u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u76f4\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5bb6\u5ead\u6210\u5458\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u66f4\u52a0\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5bb6\u5ead\u6210\u5458\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e1c\u897f -

The company says it\u2019s currently on track to top $110 million USD in revenue this year for its app now used by over 28 million monthly users across 195+ countries. As of March 2021,\u00a0916,000 families are paying for Life360\u2019s service.\n The celeb investors along with Life360 will form the Family Advisory Council which will draw on the advisors\u2019 own family experiences to help inform feature developments and shape the future of the product and marketing strategy, Life360 says.\n  The company has been working to be more responsive to family members\u2019 concerns, as it wants to position its app as something all family members want to use \u2014 not just helicopter parents snooping on their kids. In fact, Life360 CEO Chris Hulls  took to TikTok last year to listen to teens\u2019 complaints about their lack of privacy, then used that to develop a more privacy-respecting feature called \u201cBubbles.\u201d The feature shows a bubble around a general location, not a blue dot with an exact location. This is meant to give teens a sense of the freedom they crave, while also helping parents and kids establish better trust.\n The new Family Advisory Council could help Life360 streamline similar sorts of input from families, it appears.\n \u201cInvesting and advising in companies is typically an adult thing, not something you do with your children,\u201d said Hulls, in a statement about the investment. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a unique opportunity to advise on a product side by side with your kids. Having the support of these icons speaks volumes to our long term vision to be the leading provider in family safety services. Life360 wants to create a brand that feels meaningful and relevant for both parents and kids. So it\u2019s only natural that we would ask our investors to participate in the same spirit,\u201d he added.\n \u201cOne of my passions is ensuring children get the opportunities they deserve,\u201d noted new investor, Vanessa Bryant (Kobe\u2019s widow). \u201cLife360 helps families feel safe and protected by making carpooling, pickup and drop-offs easier for parents, while also providing locations at their kids\u2019 schools, activities and sports practices. Having modern tools like driving information, speed and phone usage makes me feel a lot more at ease, especially with my teenage driver. I love the fact that I can see my daughter\u2019s location and speed in a vehicle whether she\u2019s driving or as a passenger,\u201d her statement said.\n Though best known for its location services, Life360 has been working to establish itself as more than just a family tracker, given the competition from apps like Find My that now come built into mobile devices, as well as services provided by mobile operators. Today, Life360\u2019s suite of family tools includes those for driving safety, emergency assistance, identity protection, and more.\n Earlier this year, Life360 also announced the  acquisition of wearable device maker Jiobit to expand its tracking abilities to include family members without phones, like young children and even pet.\n  The addition of the new investors follows Life360\u2019s  appointment of Randi Zuckerberg to its Board of Directors earlier this year, and last year\u2019s addition of new C-Suite execs, CFO Russell Burke and CPO Jonathan Benassaya, to focus on the company\u2019s business mode and product offerings, respectively.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:47:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "app,celebs,life360",

(Indian regulator, the Competition Commission of India, needs to approve the investment.) Zomato\u2019s proposed investment is part of a broader round, in which others including Tiger Global and SoftBank Vision Fund 2 are expected to chip in some capital. Zomato said it had no comment.\n The leadership teams at Grofers and Zomato have long been close friends and began exploring this investment earlier this year. Both the firms are also open to the idea of Zomato acquiring a majority stake in Grofers in the coming quarters, though a decision hasn\u2019t been reached and won\u2019t be fully explored until Zomato becomes a publicly traded company, the source told TechCrunch.\n  Zomato, which  acquired Uber\u2019s Indian food delivery business early last year, has told some of its major investors that it envisions a future where the Gurgaon-based firm has expanded much beyond the food delivery category, the source said, requesting anonymity as the talks are private.\n Grofers operates an online grocery delivery service in India. The startup has witnessed a sharp surge in its popularity in the past year as several Indian states enforced strict lockdown restrictions to contain the spread of the virus. The startup competes with BigBasket, which recently  sold its majority stake to Indian conglomerate Tata Group.\n The Indian online grocery market has seen a new player emerge in the past one year, Reliance Industries, India\u2019s most valuable firm. Reliance, which operates the largest retail chain in India, last year  launched JioMart.\n \u201cJioMart\u2019s growth is a testament to its already loyal customer base, 80% of whom are repeat shoppers. JioMart New commerce\u2019s aim is to transform and grow the small merchant ecosystem, so our merchant partners prosper. Over the past year, over 300,000 merchant or shopkeeper partners across 150 cities were enabled and empowered to transform their businesses both physically and digitally,\u201d said Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, earlier this month.\n In a note to clients earlier this year, Bank of America analysts estimated that the online grocery delivery market could be worth $12 billion in India by 2023.\n \u201cCompetition is high in the sector with large verticals like BigBasket/Grofers and horizontal like Amazon/Flipkart trying to convert the unorganized market to organized one. Till recently the No 1 player in the space was BigBasket, with it hitting $1 billion annualized GMV &amp; selling over 300,000 orders every day. Reliance Industries also threw its hat with the company launching its JioMart app in May-20 across 200 cites,\u201d they wrote.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:46:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "grofers,investment,\u5370\u5ea6", "title": "Zomato\u76841\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6295\u8d44\u5c06Grofers\u53d8\u6210\u72ec\u89d2\u517d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tZomato\u2019s $100 million investment to turn Grofers into a unicorn\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["grofers", "\u5370\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "adc62c392bbe660014de64eac65c06ff.jpg", "infoid": 1068700, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\uff0c6\u670829\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 -  Elon Musk\u5468\u4e8c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4f01\u4e1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u79ef\u6781\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u4e4b\u524d\uff0cStarlink\u7684\u603b\u6295\u8d44\u5c06\u8fbe\u523050\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u548c100\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002  Tesla Inc\uff08Tsla.o\uff09\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98The Tesla Inc\uff08Tsla.o\uff09\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\uff0c\u603b\u6295\u8d44\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u523020-300\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 ", "note_en": "BARCELONA, June 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Tuesday that total investments in Starlink would reach between $5 billion and $10 billion before the satellite internet venture achieves positive cash flow.\n Over the lifetime of the project, total investments could run to $20-$30 billion, the Tesla Inc  (TSLA.O) CEO told the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 02:38:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6295\u8d44,total", "title": "Musk\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65af\u5854\u9686\u7684\u603b\u6295\u8d44\u8fbe\u523020\u7f8e\u5143\u81f330\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "Musk Says Total Investments in Starlink To Reach $20-$30 Billion", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-total-investments-starlink-reach-20-30-billion-2021-06-29/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6295\u8d44", "total"]}]
