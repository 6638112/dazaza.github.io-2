For a human to communicate with a computer, English-like commands on text shell or graphical user interfaces that uses point-and-click model works great. But once that ends and when two or more computers have to interact, text protocols may not be all that helpful. Yet, text based computer-to-computer protocols are extremely common and often seemingly ubiquitous even in places where it&#39;s impossible for an average human to interact.\n Here are some shaky arguments you&#39;ll come across on the internet that glorifies text based protocols.\n    To be clear, historically computers had different bit widths ranging anywhere from 1 to 48 bits per byte between vendors and models. Even text itself was encoded differently on different computers from BCD, IBM, ISO, and 100s more. If you have any latest Linux or BSD computer, type  iconv -l to list some popular text encoding formats. ASCII and UTF-8/16/32 eventually fixed the encoding problems only recently in late 80s and early 90s. Text was never as portable as it&#39;s believed to be.\n It was only somewhere in early 90s did  ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993 came up suggesting power of 2 for measuring data widths -- fixing byte as 8 bits. And now nearly almost all CPUs in use today represent numbers in two&#39;s complement making binary messages a simpler alternative over text formats.\n  Surely, it&#39;s not like you will open a terminal on your cell-phone and then type in  SIP like this to call your friend.\n INVITE sip:1001@10.0.0.1:2780;transport=udp SIP/2.0Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 10.0.1.12:5060;rportFrom: &lt;sip:2001@10.0.1.12&gt;;tag=a1b2c3d4e5To: &#34;1001&#34;&lt;sip:1001@10.0.1.12&gt;;tag=z1y2x3w4v5Contact: &lt;sip:2001@10.0.1.12&gt;Call-ID: OWYwZTg2NDRkOTZjYjc4NjUzYTE1ZGY5ZGY3ZGVkMmQ.CSeq: 102 INVITEUser-Agent: Asterisk PBXMax-Forwards: 70Allow: INVITE, ACK, CANCEL, OPTIONS, BYE, REFER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, INFOSupported: replacesContent-Type: application/sdpContent-Length: 210.v=0o=root 6668 6669 IN IP4 10.0.0.2s=sessionc=IN IP4 10.0.0.2t=0 0m=audio 5004 RTP/AVP 8 101a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000a=fmtp:101 0-16a=ptime:20a=sendrecv\n People don&#39;t even dial an actual number any more these days. It&#39;s usually a name searched in contacts followed by the &#34;Dial&#34; button. Any argument around this usually derives from the idea that it&#39;s as easy as opening a socket and typing out a command. It maybe true with FTP or  telnet, but not so much with HTTP or any modern day text based protocols.\n   Without a visualiser (even a  rudimentary one), the above message and the subsequent control-plane communication is not easy to debug. Sure you can view this on a terminal or edit this in your favourite text editor, but what next? How are you going to feed this into the call controller machinery without extensive debug openings into the state machine library?\n  struct ntp_ts { uint32_t secs; uint32_t frac;};struct ntp_packet { unsigned int li: 2; /* Leap Indicator */ unsigned int vn: 3; /* Version number of the protocol */ unsigned int mode: 3; /* Client or server */ uint8_t stratum; /* Stratum level of the local clock */ uint8_t poll; /* Maximum interval between successive messages */ uint8_t precision; /* Precision of the local clock */ uint32_t root_delay; /* Total round trip delay time */ uint32_t root_dispersion; /* Maximum error allowed from primary clock source */ uint32_t ref_id; /* Reference clock identifier */ struct ntp_ts ref_ts; /* Reference time-stamp */ struct ntp_ts org_ts; /* Originate time-stamp */ struct ntp_ts rx_ts; /* Received time-stamp seconds */ struct ntp_ts tx_ts; /* Important field for client: Transmit time-stamp */} __attribute__((packed));\n It is as simple as dumping  struct ntp_packet on wire and reading it off it -- no parsing involved except for calling  ntohX()/ htonX() on all fields except  li,  vn and  mode. But with SIP/HTTP, a simple line like  Content-Length: 300 will require a good bit of string parsing, manipulation, etc.\n Do you think JSON/XML would look nicer? If a parser was to be written that parsed NTP over JSON using DOM or Stream parser, it won&#39;t be apparent what is being parsed by just looking at the source code. Now of course you can add a few extra layers on top where there is some kind of style sheet or meta XML that is parsed during build that gives you a  class NTPPacket with several  get/ set functions and also a cute looking serializer function or perhaps a class too. Parsing now is no more a  O(1) problem but a complex  O(wtf) problem with equally complex memory usage. But because that equation can somehow be expressed in terms of  n, people will have cartoonish light bulb moment, concluding that the said parsing algorithm is  linearly scalable. Since hardware is also cheap, it&#39;s easier to add more hardware to handle more messages, so it&#39;s a matter of client side economics and that there&#39;s nothing to worry about code-readability and long term maintainability. Any attempt to use  struct again will be branded backward thinking or a futile attempt at premature optimisation.\n  When people talk about extensibility, they often expect adding or removing fields at will. Probably, they&#39;ve never heard of  Tag-Length-Value technique or the modern day  CBOR. I mean sure, you can add a new  Content-Type: application/batmobile but if the other end doesn&#39;t recognise the value or even the entire field, it isn&#39;t so much useful anyway.\n  How many HTTP/XML/JSON parsers out there recover from failed tokens and read the remaining contents? And how useful will that data be overall? Most popular parsers usually fail on the first error and report it. Protocols built on this usually send an error message back. So there&#39;s not much of error recovery either. Arguments around this usually suggests that somehow text protocols are resilient to 1 off errors and that the message as a whole is not corrupted. This argument is actually true for  syslog vs  journalctl but not so much in communication protocols.\n  This is not to say text protocols are wrong; they have a place. They are very useful in programming languages that cannot offset into a memory chunk directly without using  unholy,  bloated APIs. But using them in telecommunication systems which is predominantly machine-to-machine is just an overkill. Hardware is getting cheaper by the day and adding more memory and more CPUs to do a task will be economical. Nevertheless, binary protocols are both space and time efficient. They have less overhead in parsing/building and are slightly easier to maintain.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 14:12:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Mustafa Hashem al-Darwish has been executed. His family received no advance notice, and found out Mustafa had been executed by reading the news online.\n Mustafa was arrested in May 2015, and charged with offences related to his participation in protests, many of which occurred when he was 17 years old. He was placed in solitary confinement and beaten so badly that he lost consciousness several times. To make the torture stop, he confessed to the charges against him.\n  At his trial, Mustafa told the court that he had been tortured and recanted his confession. The court was also aware that Mustafa was a child at the time of many of the alleged offences. Despite these clear violations of domestic and international law, he was sentenced to death.\n In the last five years, Saudi Arabian authorities have repeatedly stated that they have abolished the death penalty for children.\n In September 2016, Saudi Arabia\u2019s delegation to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child\u00a0 stated\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cthere is no application of the death penalty on children.\u201d\n In August 2018, promoting the Juvenile Law, the Kingdom\u2019s delegation\u00a0 told the UN: \u201cif the crime committed by the juvenile is punishable by death, the sentence shall be reduced to a term of not more than ten years detention\u201d.\n On April 23, 2019, six young men sentenced to death for childhood crimes were among those killed in a\u00a0 mass execution\u00a0of 37 people.\n In April 2020, the Saudi Human Rights Commission (SHRC)\u00a0 announced\u00a0a Royal Decree extending the Juvenile Law and later\u00a0 insisted\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cno-one in Saudi Arabia will be executed for a crime committed as a minor.\u201d\n In February 2021, the Saudi authorities\u00a0 told\u00a0the UN Human Rights Council that\u00a0\u201canyone who commits a death-eligible crime as a child\u201d will be subject to\u00a0\u201ca maximum sentence of ten years in a juvenile institution\u201d.\n The execution of Mustafa al-Darwish once again shows that the Kingdom\u2019s claim to have eliminated capital punishment for childhood crimes is not true.\n Mustafa\u2019s family has released the following statement: \u201c Six years ago, Mustafa was arrested with two of his friends in the streets of Tarout. The police released him without charge but confiscated his phone. We later found out that there was a photograph on the phone that offended them.\n Later they called us and told Mustafa to come and collect his phone, but instead of giving it back they detained him and our suffering began. How can they execute a boy because of a photograph on his phone? Since his arrest, we have known nothing but pain. It is a living death for the whole family.\u201d\n Reprieve Director Maya Foa commented:\u00a0 \u201cIt is not enough for Saudi Arabia\u2019s partners to \u2018raise human rights issues,\u2019 as British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reportedly did on his recent visit to the Kingdom.

In addition to its shady cherry blossom tree-lined pathways and beautiful lotus pond, the park is home to multiple museums and a zoo, and now it\u2019s added even more attractions with a pair of brand-new\u00a0Pokemon manhole covers.\n   These are\u00a0the first-ever Pokemon manhole covers, or Pokefuta, as they\u2019re called in Japanese, to be installed in central Tokyo, and none other than Pikachu himself was on-site for a special ceremony prior to their June 14 installation.\n Appearing on the first of the two covers is\u00a0Tyrunt, the Tyrannosaurus-like Pokemon who Trainers can resurrect from a fossil in the\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon. Appropriately, the Tyrunt Pokefuta, which also features\u00a0Wynaut, is found in Ueno Park near the entrance to the\u00a0National Museum of Nature and Science, which has an impressive collection of dinosaur fossils itself.\n   \u25bc The Tyrunt/Wynaut Pokefuta is found not far from the museum\u2019s full-scale blue whale replica statue.\n   Meanwhile, Ueno\u2019s other Pokemon manhole cover stars\u00a0Baltoy, whose design is inspired by\u00a0Japan\u2019s traditional earthenware\u00a0 dogu\u00a0figures\u00a0from the late Jomon period (c. 1000 BC), and\u00a0Bronzor, a mysterious steel/psychic-type found in tombs, according to\u00a0Pokemon\u00a0lore.\n    Because of Dogu and Bronzor\u2019s connections to ancient civilizations, their Pokefuta has been placed near the main gate of the park\u2019s\u00a0Tokyo National Museum, whose extensive collection of artistic antiquities includes dogu.\n \u25bc\u00a0Both Pokefuta are in public areas of the park, so you don\u2019t need to purchase a museum admission ticket to see them.\n      As the first Pokefuta in Tokyo\u2019s 23 central wards (the capital\u2019s others are\u00a0out in the suburbs\u00a0or\u00a0a town that\u2019s 24-hour boat ride from downtown that\u2019s still technically part of Tokyo), the two new covers are sure to get plenty of visitors Thankfully, the Pokefuta are permanent installations, so there\u2019s no rush to see them if a trip to Tokyo isn\u2019t in your immediate travel plans, and if you end up having to wait until next spring you\u2019ll be just in time to also see\u00a0the full-size Pok\u00e9mon skeletons\u00a0at the special exhibit coming to the National Museum of Nature and Science.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 14:11:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "manhole,\u535a\u7269\u9986", "title": "Pokemon Manhole Covers\u5b89\u88c5\u5728\u4e1c\u4eac\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3 ", "title_en": "Pokemon manhole covers installed in downtown Tokyo", "transed": 1, "url": "https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/first-ever-pokemon-manhole-covers-installed-in-downtown-tokyo", "via": "", "real_tags": ["manhole", "\u535a\u7269\u9986"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ee61055bd21b27ce85dfd35da164d4bb.jpg", "infoid": 1066389, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Wayne Nutt\u82b1\u4e8637\u591a\u5e74\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec3\u4e60\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u5317\u5361\u7f57\u6765\u7eb3\u5dde\u675c\u90a6\u516c\u53f8\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u90a3\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u8f93\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u5c55\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1Wayne\u662f\u6b63\u5f0f\u57f9\u8bad\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff08Iowa'67\u5927\u5b66\uff09\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4ece\u672a\u6210\u4e3a\u6301\u724c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08 -

In that time, he worked with a variety of different technologies and designed and built a variety of things, including pipes for transportation of fluid, while developing deep expertise in chemical engineering and technology.\n Although Wayne is formally trained as an engineer (University of Iowa \u201867) and worked as an engineer, he\u2019s never been a  licensed engineer\u2014none of the projects he worked on at DuPont required a stamp from a professional engineer, and, by working directly for DuPont, he avoided the licensing requirement in the various states where he worked (which included Texas, Tennessee, and briefly Virginia, in addition to his primary base in North Carolina).\n Wayne is also a man with opinions, and he has regularly expressed them in public, more so since his retirement in 2013. He has written letters to county and state government officials about proposed projects; he has objected to an error he discovered in the drainage study a licensed engineer conducted for a proposed development in his hometown of Ogden; he has testified before a county commission about what he calls a \u201csimple addition\u201d error made in a traffic engineer\u2019s report to the county. Simply put, like many lifelong engineers, Wayne notices when things are wrong, and it bugs him.\n This has gotten him into trouble most recently when he agreed to help his son, Kyle, a North Carolina attorney, with a case about a piping system that had flooded a few local homes. Both sides in the case had retained experts, but none of the experts discussed the pipe\u2019s capacity or what the effect of a blockage might be on the flow of fluid through the pipes. So, Wayne offered to tell them about it. From Wayne\u2019s perspective, it was a simple calculation that just required him to pick up the book   Cameron Hydraulic Data off his bookshelf and do a little simple math\u2014or, at least, math that was pretty simple for someone who had been doing this his whole life.\n That simple math, though, turned into a problem when Wayne was deposed in the underlying case. After Wayne testified truthfully that he was not (and never had been) a licensed engineer, the lawyers for the defendant threatened to report him to the North Carolina Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors. Wayne didn\u2019t take the threat seriously; he wasn\u2019t designing anything or building anything, he was just offering his opinion about something that might have happened in the past.\n The Board, though, did take it seriously. The Board\u2019s position, as summed up in an  email from its attorney, is \u201cthat any testimony that requires engineering knowledge to adequately provide and to protect the public falls with the definition of the practice of engineering and requires [an engineer] license.\u201d Even if a judge rules that someone\u2019s testimony is admissible in court, the Board makes a separate determination of whether the testimony was too steeped in \u201cengineering knowledge\u201d and therefore the unlicensed practice of engineering\u2014and, therefore, a crime. Not only was Wayne\u2019s testimony in the deposition probably a crime, but many of his other public statements about engineering seem (at least in the Board\u2019s view) to have been crimes as well.\n In other words, the Board\u2019s position is that Wayne did not need a license to actually engineer things in North Carolina. He only needs a license to talk about how to engineer things in North Carolina. In the Board\u2019s view, Wayne should either become a licensed North Carolina engineer or simply shut up.\n Wayne does not want to become a licensed North Carolina engineer because he is 77 years old and not looking for a new job. He also does not want to shut up because he is Wayne Nutt, and when he finds a math error in someone else\u2019s work or sees a question that he knows how to answer, he intends to speak up. But the Board is moving against him anyway\u2014in May, they sent a  certified letter to his house informing him that they were investigating charges that had been brought against him for the unlicensed practice of engineering in the form of answering questions at his deposition.\n  North Carolina, like every state in the country, licenses engineers. [i] And licensed professional engineers play an important role under North Carolina law. A professional engineer, like a licensed architect, gets a personalized stamp that can be used to approve plans or designs. [ii] And that stamp matters. Certain kinds of building permits require a stamp from an engineer or architect. [iii] Certain public buildings cannot be constructed without a stamp from an engineer or architect. [iv] Cities cannot use red-light cameras unless an engineer has stamped the traffic plan that sets the timing for their yellow lights. [v]\n Becoming a licensed engineer is correspondingly onerous: Would-be engineers must pass two examinations, pay fees, meet minimum education and experience requirements, and get a certain number of continuing-education hours each year. [vi]\n But North Carolina, also like every state in the country, has an \u201cindustrial exemption\u201d to its licensing requirement. [vii] That exemption means that unlicensed people are free to work as engineers\u2014to design, build, or engineer things like pipelines or machinery\u2014so long as they work for a business that is making a product. If someone is hired to design a system of drainage pipes for a town, that person likely needs to be a licensed engineer. If someone, like Wayne Nutt, is hired to design a system of drainage pipes for DuPont, that person can generally work without a license.\n And that is exactly what most engineers do. According to  one scholar, about 80 percent of Americans who earn a living as an engineer do not hold a license to do so. They actually engineer things, but because they work for a manufacturer and have no desire to officially stamp plans, they do not need a license.\n The problem is that North Carolina (again like other states) has a sweeping definition of what it means to \u201cpractice\u201d engineering that goes far beyond stamping plans. Under state law, \u201cany service or creative work, the adequate performance of which requires engineering education, training, and experience, in the application of special knowledge of the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences to such services or creative work as consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning, and design of engineering works and systems\u201d is the \u201cpractice of engineering.\u201d [viii] In other words, creative work requiring you to do math about the physical world is engineering. And, unless you work for a big company, it\u2019s probably illegal.\n This puts Wayne Nutt, like many other American engineers in an awkward position. He did not need a license to be an engineer, but the state says he needs a license if he wants to talk about engineering.\n  Wayne Nutt is not alone. Across the country, licensing authorities are wielding their power to silence speakers they do not approve of or punish people for speech they do not like. In Oregon, the state engineering board fined  Mats J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m $500 for the crime of publicly complaining about yellow-light timing without a license. In California, a state board has tried to forbid  a horseshoeing school from teaching horseshoeing to people who have not graduated from high school. And in North Carolina itself, this same state board has cracked down on  drone enthusiasts who take pictures of land on the theory that these pictures constitute \u201csurveying.\u201d\n And these growing crackdowns on speech come alongside a national explosion of occupational-licensing requirements. Today,  about a fifth of American workers need a license from the government to do their job. With the boards in charge of those licenses increasingly acting as if the First Amendment does not apply to them, the speech rights of literally millions of Americans hang in the balance.\n  The legal claims are straightforward. Talking about engineering\u2014including talking about engineering on a witness stand\u2014is speech, and the government cannot make it illegal to speak on certain topics without a license. There is no exception to the First Amendment for occupational licensing, and there is no point at which speech becomes so complex that it loses its First Amendment protection. Quite the contrary: The First Amendment protects our right to hear useful speech on complex topics, and the fact that Wayne wants to share his opinions about important and complicated engineering questions make it more, not less, important that his speech receive legal protections.\n  This case is being litigated by IJ Senior Attorney Robert McNamara and IJ Attorney Joseph Gay, along with local counsel Cory Reiss of the Wilmington law firm of Reiss &amp; Nutt, PLLC.\n  The Institute for Justice is a non-profit, public interest law firm. IJ\u2019s pioneering defense of occupational speech and the First Amendment right to speak for a living has resulted in victories for tour guides, technology entrepreneurs, makeup artists, diet bloggers, engineers, psychologists, and others across the country.\n    Sign up to receive IJ&#39;s biweekly digital magazine,  Liberty &amp; Law along with breaking updates about our fight to protect the rights of all Americans.\n   \u00a9 Institute for Justice 2021  IJ \u00ae is a registered trademark of the Institute for Justice.

", "note_en": "It\u2019s now closed a series B round of \u20ac20M / $24M, and merged with another competitor, Homefully, founded by Sebastian Wuerz in 2016. The round was backed by HV Capital (formerly Holtzbrink Ventures), Vorwerk Ventures, P101 and Picus Capital.\n Founded in 2017 by Luca Bovone, Habyt will now have over 5,000 units across 15 cities and 6 countries. The merged companies will offer fully furnished and serviced living units, coupled with a tech-enabled user-experience and a focus on community, aimed at young professionals between 20 and 35 years old who move jobs and cities fairly frequently.\n  Luca Bovone, Founder and CEO of Habyt, said: \u201cWe have been on an incredible journey in the past year and a half. In spite of less than perfect market conditions we have been able to grow a lot via a very successful M&amp;A strategy that brought us into the position of leaders of our sector in Europe and that still has a lot of potential. This 20M series B round really opens our doors to keep building Habyt both via organic growth and via more M&amp;As. We are now looking at strategic targets in Europe, specifically in France and Italy, and also in other continents, especially in Asia.\u201d\n Sebastian Wuerz, Founder of homefully, said: \u201cThe coliving market is going through a consolidation phase and Habyt has really seized this opportunity quickly and effectively and is on the best track to become the leader of the sector at a global scale. Joining forces is a crucial step in this direction and I am very excited for the team to be part of this journey.\u201d\n Felix Kluehr, Partner at HV said: \u201cWe are happy to see that Habyt has emerged as the leading player in the European co-living market and HV is excited to support the team in their ambitious plan to build the leading European coliving company\u201d.\n Over an interview, Bovone told me: \u201cIt\u2019s like a member\u2019s club. We have a subscription model, where people pay a monthly fee, which is your rent, and then you can, of course, apply for a room somewhere else and know that we have a fairly decent scale across Europe and eventually, also in southern Europe. You are able to move from one place to the other. Our motto is live anywhere.\u201d\n He said that the pandemic had meant that people were ditching co-working spaces and \u201cThey would prefer to spend 50 to 100 euro more per month on getting better housing where they can work comfortably from home.\u201d\n \u201cWe are already seeing within our customer base, they want to stay six months in Berlin, three months in Madrid, then move back to Berlin and so on. The traditional housing market just doesn\u2019t allow that to happen. You have contracts with utilities and so on, which you can never break and it\u2019s just an outdated product offering, and we\u2019re trying to tackle that.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-17 13:35:16",

\u6210\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5458 ", "note_en": "Imply, a startup developing a real-time analytics platform, today announced that it raised $70 million in series C funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, valuing the company at $700 million post-money. CEO Fangjin Yang says that the proceeds will help to support Imply\u2019s product and go-to-market efforts, including its cloud service and its prebuilt visualization application Imply Pivot, as well as investments in people and technology that will help the company to \u201crapidly grow business.\u201d\n Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to extract meaningful insights.\u00a0Businesses that use big data increase their profits by an average of 8% according to a  survey conducted by research firm BARC. A range of organizations can use data to boost their marketing strategies, increase their bottom line, personalize their content, and better understand their customers. But only 4% of companies say they have the people, tools, data, and intent to draw meaningful insights from that data and to act on them, according to a Bain  report.\n   Burlingame, California-based Imply provides a suite of tools to run large-scale analytic workloads. It\u2019s built on  Apache Druid, a column-oriented, open source distributed data store written in Java that\u2019s designed to quickly ingest massive quantities of event data and provide low-latency queries on top of that data. Druid was started in 2011 to power analytics products at  Metamarkets, a programmatic advertising startup Snap acquired in 2017, and it was moved to an Apache license in 2015.\n Imply was founded by Yang, Gian Merlino, and Vadim Ogievetsky, the lead engineers of the original team that created Druid.\u00a0 Their goal with the Druid project was to enable users to arbitrarily explore and aggregate data, and to have visualizations update as fast as users could navigate through the data. This required a data store that could support interactivity \u201cat scale\u201d as well as offer complete flexibility in how data could be explored.\n \u201cDruid came into existence to fill a gap in the data world, and was architected with a few key attributes in mind: sub-second queries so users can explore data without breaking their workflow, streaming data ingestion so events can be explored immediately after they occur. After Druid was open sourced, people began using it for everything from analyzing ad tech, network traffic, website usage, finance, and sensor data,\u201d Yang told VentureBeat via email. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way over the past few years in terms of both adoption and scale. Existing Druid clusters now scale to petabytes of raw data, trillions of events, and millions of daily queries.\u201d\n  Yang asserts that Imply is one of the few analytics solution providers with a true full-stack solution for \u201canalytics-in-motion\u201d use cases. Leveraging the power of Druid, the platform allows customers to create data analytics queries on the fly and receive answers immediately \u2014 or almost immediately.\n Imply is built to scale with technologies including large data volumes and high search concurrency, Yang says, as well as low-latency infrastructure. And unlike several rival products, Imply can compare present data with past data as well as data in motion.\n \u201cSome people refer to real-time analytics as analytics based on real-time data, but they don\u2019t mention that questions need to be predetermined; that the data is only historical data; that the solution doesn\u2019t scale beyond a certain number of records; and that the solution is prohibitively expensive. They also don\u2019t mention that they provide only an engine, not also a UI or app,\u201d Yang explained. \u201cThis is a huge handcuff as you have to wait hours or days to iterate and get to the \u2018a-ha moment.\u2019 Moreover, you can\u2019t know what\u2019s happening now or compare what\u2019s happening now to the past, or account for data volumes that grow exponentially every year.\u201d\n To illustrate the ostensible benefits of Imply, Yang gave the example of Sift, a fraud detection startup using the platform for AI and machine learning workloads. Sift is tapping Imply\u2019s analytics engine for real-time data ingestion, allowing the company to aggregate data by a range of dimensions from thousands of servers and query across a moving time window with on-demand analysis and visualization.\n  \u201cThe pandemic has accelerated the rate of digital transformation in our customers, and analytics is at the forefront of their initiatives,\u201d Yang said. \u201c[Our over 100 customers, including Plaid and Cisco ThousandEyes,] leverage analytics-in-motion as the analytics engine behind applications centered around security, operational, and business insights, and as a complete solution to solve internal business intelligence and operational analytics use cases such as operational analytics, security analytics, advertising analytics, behavioral analytics, and more.\u201d\n Imply, which has around 132 employees, isn\u2019t disclosing annual recurring revenue just yet.\u00a0 But the market opportunity for big data analytics is large and growing, as evidenced by the funding rounds closed by competitors like  Firebolt,  Leadspace,  Dremio, and  Noogata.\u00a0Market Research Future\u00a0 predicts that the global data analytics market will be valued at over $132 billion by 2026.\n Imply\u2019s latest funding round brings its total raised to $116 million to date, and comes as the company hires a new chief marketing officer \u2014 ex-Confluent product marketing leader Praveen Rangnath \u2014 and VP of customer success \u2014 former Fivetran customer success head Kevin Hodgkins. In addition to Bessemer, the round saw participation from Tiger Global Management, A16z, Khosla Ventures, and Geodesic Capital.\n VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

"Cond\u00e9 Nast has agreed to its first contract with unionized employees at the New Yorker and two other publications, marking the media company\u2019s first labor agreement in its history and averting a threatened strike after 2\u00bd years of negotiations.\n  The three-year deal, which also covers staffers at music website Pitchfork and technology publication Ars Technica, raises the salary floor to $60,000 in the final year of the contract, places a cap on healthcare cost increases and establishes a defined 40-hour workweek. It also includes stipulations that employees can be fired only for cause, an issue that had been a sticking point in the contract talks.\n  \u201cThanks to our members\u2019 hard work, the era of at-will employment and wage stagnation at the New Yorker is finally over,\u201d said Natalie Meade, unit chair of the New Yorker Union. \u201cThroughout two and half years of negotiations, our union remained steadfast in our commitment to improve the quality of life for ourselves and for future employees.\u201d\n    The deal comes amid a continuing wave of  labor organizing in media companies around the country over the past several years, from digital startups to legacy news organizations like Cond\u00e9 Nast that had never before had unions. Editorial employees at The Wall Street Journal have been unionized since 1937.\n    Tensions around the New Yorker Union negotiations had risen in recent months after unionized employees voted to authorize a strike in March. Earlier in June, dozens of Cond\u00e9 Nast employees picketed outside the Manhattan home of Global Chief Content Officer Anna Wintour. Ms. Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue magazine, has gained a more expansive leadership role across Cond\u00e9 Nast in recent years but doesn\u2019t oversee the New Yorker, which is led by Editor David Remnick.\n  The New Yorker Union said publicly last week that its members were \u201con the verge of a strike\u201d and set up a  website enumerating its demands and publicizing plans for \u201cboth a physical and a digital picket\u201d were the group\u2019s leaders to call for such actions.\n    The deal must now be ratified by union members, who are represented by the NewsGuild of New York. The contract covers 120 employees at the New Yorker, including copy editors, fact checkers and designers, but not writers. The contract also covers 15 people at Ars Technica and 17 at Pitchfork.\n  In a statement, Cond\u00e9 Nast said it was pleased to have reached an agreement with unions at the three publications.\n  \u201cOver the last year, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s new executive leadership team has implemented equitable compensation and inclusive benefits standards across our workforce. These standards are now reflected in our agreement with union employees,\u201d the statement said.\n    Staffers at the New Yorker unionized in mid-2018, with Ars Technica and Pitchfork following in 2019. Wired staffers joined the union in 2020.\n  Appeared in the June 17, 2021, print edition as &#39;Cond\u00e9 Nast Reaches Its First Union Pact.&#39;", "posttime": "2021-06-17 13:27:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "technica,nast,\u5458\u5de5", "title": "Conc\u00e9danast\u540c\u610f\u4e0eArs Technica\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4eba\uff0c\u5e72\u8349\u53c9\u7684\u8054\u76df\u5408\u540c ", "title_en": "Cond\u00e9 Nast Agrees to Contract with Union at Ars Technica, New Yorker, Pitchfork", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/conde-nast-agrees-to-contract-with-new-yorker-union-averting-strike-11623889643", "via": "", "real_tags": ["technica", "nast", "\u5458\u5de5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0d620e52d8f1399fa73ad4247612bfe8.jpg", "infoid": 1066384, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6240\u6709\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u8be2\u95ee\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e2\u961f\uff1a\u5f53\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6c7d\u8f66\u66f4\u6539\uff1f\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be2\u95ee\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u5b83\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u8eab\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1 - \u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u643a\u5e26\u4eba\u4eec\n NORO\uff06\uff0339;\u7b54\u6848\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u7684\u8857\u9053\u4e0a\u904d\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u9001\u8d27\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u662f\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a - \u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u83b7\u5f97\u5546\u54c1\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u62ef\u6551\u4eba\u4eec\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u505a\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u516c\u53f8\u5199\u9053\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u81ea\u6cbb\u9001\u8d27\u8f66\u5747\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u8857\u533a\u5f00\u8f66\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ea\u643a\u5e26\u8d27\u7269\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u5730\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u8dd1\u9053\u66f4\u52a0\u806a\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n   4\u6708\u4efd\uff0cNuro R2\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u56f4\u7ed5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u793e\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u56f4\u7ed5\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u4eea\u5668\u822c\u7684\u666e\u9510\u65af\u4eba\u4e4b\u540e\u6d3e\u51fa\u591a\u7c73\u8bfa\u9aa8\u724c\u548c\uff0339;\u5728\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u9009\u62e9\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e0e\u8054\u90a6\u5feb\u9012\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u6279Nuro\uff06\uff0339;\u987a\u4fbf\u8bf4\u4e00\u5708\uff08\u987a\u4fbf\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e0b\uff09\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6210\u957f\u8230\u961f\uff06\uff0334;\u5230\u7269\u6d41\u548c\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u8f6c\u578b\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5199Dave Ferguson\uff0cNuro\uff06\uff0339;\u540c\u4e8b\u3002\n  \u56de\u5230R2\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\uff06\uff0339;

The startup is in the business of last-mile delivery\u2014ideally in underserved areas, the company says\u2014and reckons the best way to get goods to people is to save people as much of the trip as possible. &#34;It&#39;s time for robots to do the driving,&#34; the company writes. &#34;Our custom autonomous delivery vehicles are designed to drive in neighborhoods. And because they only carry goods, they prioritize the safety of others. It&#39;s a safer, smarter approach to everyday errands.&#34;\n   In April  the Nuro R2 began delivering Domino&#39;s pizzas to select customers in Houston, after exhaustively mapping the test neighborhoods with a fleet of instrument-riddled Priuses. Now they&#39;ve  announced a partnership with FedEx, who has committed to using a fleet of Nuro&#39;s deliverybots (which are electric, by the way). The eventual goal is to grow that fleet &#34;to a scale that will be transformative for logistics and for everyday life,&#34; writes Dave Ferguson, Nuro&#39;s Co-Founder.\n  Back to the design of the R2 itself. It can&#39;t be a coincidence that it shares its name with a certain friendly robot, and like R2-D2, Nuro&#39;s vehicle is electric. (I always assumed R2-D2 was electric, you never see Luke pouring gas into him.) And by looking at the R2, we can guess at least two things the designers were thinking:\n It&#39;s got to be friendly-looking. This is a new type of vehicle and we don&#39;t want it freaking people out.\n  Thus the form of the R2 has no caffeinated-CAD-jockey creases, brutal surface changes, zigzags or pointy bits. The body style is rounded, soft-looking, gentle even. No angry, slit-like LED headlights, but old-school round ones, like on a VW bug. An expansive windshield, even if no human is looking out of it, as if to say &#34;Relax, I&#39;m obviously a car-like object, you&#39;ve seen stuff like me before.&#34;\n   Since the designers decided\u2014presumably for safety reasons\u2014to have the packages only accessible from the curb-side of a two-way street, there are only doors on one side. And you don&#39;t want delivery recipients having to lean into the vehicle and reach across the entire width of a car to get at a package in the back. Thus the R2 is accessibly narrow, which I feel is good UX design. And the gullwing doors are a nice touch as well, admitting plenty of natural light, revealing both the packages and the friendly teal color within. There&#39;s no ducking and having to reach into the dark space of an unknown vehicle.\n   The company doesn&#39;t actually say much about the design, but does confirm that &#34;We designed it differently on purpose,&#34; on  their website. &#34;When we founded Nuro, we set out to build a new class of vehicle designed purely for transporting things instead of people. We wanted to build a self-driving vehicle, but not just a driver-less vehicle\u2014a passenger-less vehicle, too.\n   &#34;We were convinced that this kind of vehicle had the potential to be safer than passenger vehicles: more nimble, narrower, and better able to prioritize the well-being of other road users. And by building such a vehicle, we could also lower vehicle cost, improve the customer experience, and accelerate autonomous technology deployment by solving problems jointly through both hardware and software development.&#34;\n  In terms of safety, it&#39;s worth noting that with no passengers to worry about jostling, the R2 can slam on its brakes as hard as it wants. &#34;R2 can come to a quick emergency stop when necessary without concern for the groceries, pizza, or other items onboard,&#34; the companys says. &#34;But rest assured: if your pizza gets damaged along the way, we&#39;ll make sure to send another one without delay.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-17 13:27:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u643a\u5e26,autonomous,r2", "title": "R2\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u643a\u5e26\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eba ", "title_en": "The R2: An Autonomous Car Designed to Carry Things, Not People", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.core77.com/posts/109167/The-R2-An-Autonomous-Car-Designed-to-Carry-Things-Not-People", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u643a\u5e26", "r2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066383, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n1917\u5e7412\u67087\u65e5\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5ba3\u5e03\u5bf9\u5965\u5730\u5229\u5308\u7259\u5229\u7684\u6218\u4e89\uff0c\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u5927\u6218\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002[42]\u5965\u5730\u5229\u5308\u7259\u5229\u4e8e1918\u5e7411\u67083\u65e5\u6295\u964d\u3002[43]\u5965\u5730\u5229\u6210\u4e3a\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u548c\u7b7e\u7f72\u6761\u7ea6\u7684\u5171\u548c\u56fd1919\u5e74\u5723\u65e5\u8033\u66fc\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6eb6\u89e3\u5965\u5730\u5229\u5308\u7259\u5229\u3002 [44]\u8be5\u6761\u7ea6\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u5965\u5730\u5229\u4e0e\u5fb7\u56fd\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bf9\u8be5\u6761\u7ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u6279\u51c6\u5b83\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u57281921\u5e74\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u5e73\u6761\u7ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65b0\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u5de9\u56fa\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u3002 [45]\u5728\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u6c11\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u540e\uff0c\u5308\u7259\u5229\u6210\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u541b\u4e3b\u7684\u541b\u4e3b\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7531\u7687\u5bb6\u7687\u5bb6\u7edf\u6cbb\u3002\u5308\u7259\u5229\u4e8e1920\u5e74\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86Trianon\u7684\u6761\u7ea6\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5fe0\u8bda\u3002 [46]\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e8e1921\u5e74\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd - \u5308\u7259\u5229\u7684\u548c\u5e73\u6761\u7ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5de9\u56fa\u3002 [47]\n    1918\u5e74\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u519b\u961f\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5185\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u76df\u519b\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u767d\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u63a8\u7ffbBolsheviks\u3002 [48]\u5a01\u5c14\u900a\u603b\u7edf\u540c\u610f\u5728\u7ade\u9009\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u6d3e\u90635000\u540d\u7f8e\u56fd\u9646\u519b\u90e8\u961f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\uff06\uff0334;\u7f8e\u56fd\u5317\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u8fdc\u5f81\u529b\u91cf\uff06\uff0334;

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  United States involvement in regime change describes  United States government participation or interference, both overt and covert, in the replacement of foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for  regime change mainly in  Latin America and the southwest Pacific, including the  Spanish\u2013American and  Philippine\u2013American wars. At the onset of the 20th century, the United States shaped or installed governments in many countries around the world, including neighbors  Panama,  Honduras,  Nicaragua,  Mexico,  Haiti, and the  Dominican Republic.\n During  World War II, the United States helped overthrow many  Nazi Germany or  imperial Japanese  puppet regimes. Examples include regimes in the  Philippines,  Korea, the Eastern portion of  China, and much of  Europe. United States forces were also instrumental in ending the rule of  Adolf Hitler over Germany and of  Benito Mussolini over Italy. After World War II, the United States in 1945 ratified  [1] the  UN Charter, the preeminent international law document,  [2] which legally bound the U.S. government to the Charter&#39;s provisions, including Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations, except in very limited circumstances.  [3] Therefore, any legal claim advanced to justify regime change by a foreign power carries a particularly heavy burden.  [4]\n In the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. government struggled with the  Soviet Union for global leadership, influence and security within the context of the  Cold War. Under the  Eisenhower administration, the U.S. government feared that national security would be compromised by governments propped by the  Soviet Union&#39;s own involvement in regime change and promoted the  domino theory, with later presidents following Eisenhower&#39;s precedent.  [5] Subsequently, the United States expanded the geographic scope of its actions beyond traditional area of operations,  Central America and the  Caribbean. Significant operations included the United States and  United Kingdom-orchestrated  1953 Iranian coup d&#39;\u00e9tat, the 1961  Bay of Pigs Invasion targeting Cuba, and support for the  overthrow of Sukarno by General  Suharto in  Indonesia. In addition, the U.S. has  interfered in the national elections of countries, including the Philippines in 1953, and  Japan in the 1950s and 1960s  [6]  [7] as well as  Lebanon in 1957.  [8] According to one study, the U.S. performed at least 81 overt and covert known interventions in foreign elections during the period 1946\u20132000.  [9] Another study found that the U.S. engaged in 64 covert and six overt attempts at regime change during the Cold War.  [5]\n Following the  dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States has led or supported wars to determine the governance of a number of countries. Stated U.S. aims in these conflicts have included fighting the  War on Terror, as in the ongoing  Afghan war, or removing dictatorial and hostile regimes, as in the  Iraq War.\n      The United States had been at war with  Ottoman Tripolitania (an  Ottoman colony in North Africa  indirectly ruled through a  pasha) to stop them from capturing United States ships and enslaving crew members from the United States. The United States blockade had been ineffective at getting the  Pasha of Tripoli,  Yusef Karamanli, to surrender, and the United States had suffered a number of military defeats. So the United States decided to try a new tactic.  William Eaton, was given permission to and appointed by  Thomas Jefferson, to lead troops from  Alexandria, into Tripolitania to try and install Karamanli&#39;s exiled brother,  Hamet Karamanli, as the  Pasha. Eaton&#39;s troops were a combination of US soldiers and hired mercenaries, along with Hamet.  [10] He led them into the  Battle of Derna, and won a victory capturing  Derna, turning the war in US favor. Under pressure, Yusef met with State Department diplomats, and agreed to release the slaves for a ransom.  [11] Despite protest from Eaton this agreement went through, there was no regime change, and Hamet was forced to return to Egypt. William Eaton felt betrayed by the decision.  [12]\n   The United States annexed the  Republic of Texas, at the time considered by Mexico to be a rebellious province of Mexico.  [13] During the war with Mexico that ensued, the United States seized California from Mexico.  [14]\n    While the  American Civil War was taking place in the United States, France and other countries took the opportunity to invade Mexico to collect debts. France then installed  Habsburg prince  Maximilian I as the  Emperor of Mexico. After the Civil war ended the United States began supporting the  Liberal forces of  Benito Ju\u00e1rez (who had been the interim president since 1858 under the liberal  Constitution of 1857 and then elected as president in 1861 before the French invasion) against the forces of Maximilian. The United States began sending and dropping arms into Mexico and many Americans fought alongside Juarez. Eventually, Juarez and the Liberals took back power and executed Maximillian I.  [15]  [16]  [17] The United States was against it and had invoked the  Monroe Doctrine.  William Seward even said afterwards &#34;The Monroe Doctrine, which eight years ago was merely a theory, is now an irreversible fact.&#34;  [18] With the liberal victory, Mexico returned to democracy for the period of the  Restored Republic until the military coup of 1876, which was not recognised by the US until 1878.\n       In the 1880s,  Samoa was a monarchy with two rival claimants to the throne,  Malietoa Laupepa or  Mata&#39;afa Iosefo. The  Samoan crisis was a confrontation between the United States,  Germany and  Great Britain from 1887 to 1889, with the powers backing rival claimants to the throne of the  Samoan Islands which became the  First Samoan Civil War.  [19] The powers eventually agreed that Laupepa would become king. After the powers withdrew, the civil war went on until 1894, when Laupepa secured his power.\n     Anti-monarchs, mostly Americans, in  Hawaii, engineered the  overthrow of the  Kingdom of Hawaii. On January 17, 1893, the native monarch, Queen  Lili&#39;uokalani, was overthrown. Hawaii was initially reconstituted as an independent  republic, but the ultimate goal of the action was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was finally accomplished in 1898.\n     In 1821, after declaring independence from  Spain,  Panama was persuaded to join  Simon Bolivar&#39;s  Gran Colombia. It was however to be an independent entity. For the next 82 years, Panama tried to separate from Colombia more than 80 times. In 1903, the U.S. aided the  secession of Panama from the Republic of Colombia, engineered by a Panamanian faction backed by the  Panama Canal Company, a French\u2013US corporation whose aim was the construction of a waterway across the  Isthmus of Panama thus connecting the  Atlantic and  Pacific Oceans.\n In 1903, the U.S. signed the  Hay-Herr\u00e1n Treaty with Colombia, granting the United States use of the Isthmus of Panama in exchange for financial compensation.  [20]  [21] amidst the  Thousand Days&#39; War. But the Colombian Senate, seeking more money, refused to ratify the treaty. President  Theodore Roosevelt was furious and was persuaded to encourage the rebels in Panama to seek independence from Colombia. They did in November 1903 and signed a treaty with the United States. The  Panama Canal Zone was created as an  unincorporated territory under United States control. The US did not transfer the zone back to Panama until 1999.\n    In what became known as the &#34; Banana Wars,&#34; between the end of the  Spanish\u2013American War in 1898 and the inception of the  Good Neighbor Policy in 1934, the U.S. staged many military invasions and interventions in  Central America and the  Caribbean.  [22] One of these incursions (in 1903) involved regime change rather than regime preservation. The  United States Marine Corps, which most often fought these wars, developed a manual called   The Strategy and Tactics of Small Wars in 1921 based on its experiences. On occasion, the  Navy provided  gunfire support and  Army troops were also used. The  United Fruit Company and  Standard Fruit Company dominated  Honduras&#39; key  banana export sector and associated land holdings and railways. The U.S. staged invasions and incursions of US troops in 1903 (supporting a coup by  Manuel Bonilla), 1907 (supporting Bonilla against a Nicaraguan-backed coup), 1911 and 1912 (defending the regime of  Miguel R. Davila from an uprising), 1919 (peacekeeping during a civil war, and installing the caretaker government of  Francisco Bogr\u00e1n), 1920 (defending the Bogr\u00e1n regime from a general strike), 1924 (defending the regime of  Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez from an uprising) and 1925 (defending the elected government of  Miguel Paz Barahona) to defend US interests.  [23] Writer  O. Henry coined the term &#34; Banana republic&#34; in 1904 to describe Honduras.\n    After the explosion of  The Maine the United States declared war on Spain, starting the  Spanish\u2013American War.  [24] The United States invaded and occupied Spanish-ruled  Cuba in 1898. Many in the United States did not want to annex Cuba and passed the  Teller Amendment, forbidding annexation. Cuba was occupied by the U.S. run by military governor  Leonard Wood during the first occupation from 1898 to 1902, after the end of the war. The  Platt Amendment was passed later on outlining U.S. Cuban relations. It said the U.S. could intervene anytime against a government that was not approved, forced Cuba to accept U.S. influence, and limited Cuban abilities to make foreign relations.  [25] The United States forced Cuba to accept the terms of the Platt Amendment, by putting it into their constitution.  [26] After the occupation, Cuba and the U.S. would sign the  Cuban\u2013American Treaty of Relations in 1903, further agreeing to the terms of the Platt Amendment.  [27]\n Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma became the first president of Cuba after the U.S. withdrew. He was a member of the  Republican Party of Havana. He was re-elected in 1905 unopposed, however, the  Liberals accused him of electoral fraud. Fighting began between the Liberals and Republicans. Due to the tensions he resigned on September 28, 1906, and his government collapsed soon afterwards. U.S. Secretary of State William Howard Taft invoked the Platt Amendment and the 1903 treaty, under approval of Theodore Roosevelt, invading the country, and occupying it. The country would be governed by  Charles Edward Magoon during the occupation. They oversaw the election of  Jose Miguel Gomez in 1909, and afterwards withdrew from the country.  [28]\n   Governor  Juan Jose Estrada, member of the  conservative party, led a revolt against the democratically elected president,  Jose Santos Zelaya, member of the liberal party. This became what is known as the Estrada&#39;s Rebellion. The United States supported the conservative forces, because Zelaya had wanted to work with Germany or Japan to build a new canal through the country. The U.S. controlled the Panama Canal, and did not want competition from another country outside of the Americas. Thomas P Moffat, a US council [   clarification needed] in  Bluefields, Nicaragua would give overt support, in conflict with the US trying to only give covert support. Direct intervention would be pushed by the secretary of state  Philander Knox. Two Americans were executed by Zelaya for their participation with the conservatives. Seeing an opportunity the United States became directly involved in the rebellion and sent in troops, which landed on the Caribbean coast. On December 14, 1909 Zelaya was forced to resign under diplomatic pressure from America and fled Nicaragua. Before Zelaya fled, he along with the liberal assembly choose  Jose Madriz to lead Nicaragua. The U.S. refused to recognize Madriz. The conservatives eventually beat back the liberals and forced Madriz to resign. Estrada then became the president.  Thomas C Dawson was sent as a special agent to the country and determined that any election held would bring the liberals into power, so had Estrada set up a constituent assembly to elect him instead. In August 1910 Estrada became president of Nicaragua under U.S. recognition, agreeing to certain conditions from the U.S. After the intervention, the U.S. and Nicaragua signed a treaty on June 6, 1911.  [29]  [30]  [31]\n      In the years after the Estrada rebellion, conflict between the liberals and conservatives continued. U.S. loans and business were under threat. Estrada was forced to resign by the Minister of War General  Luis Mena and conservative Vice President  Adolfo Diaz replaced him. Diaz was aligned with the U.S. and this made him unpopular with the Nicaraguan populace and Mena. Mena forced the cabinet to name him the successor to Diaz, but the U.S. did not recognize the decision. Due to this Mena led a rebellion with the liberals against Diaz declaring himself president of Nicaragua.\n The  Taft administration sent troops into Nicaragua and occupied the country. When the  Wilson administration came into power, they extended the stay and took complete financial and governmental control of the country, leaving a heavily armed legation. U.S. president  Calvin Coolidge removed troops from the country, leaving a legation and Adolfo Diaz in charge of the country. Rebels ended up capturing the town with the legation and Diaz requested troops came back, which they did a few months after leaving. The U.S. government fought against rebels led by  Augusto Cesar Sandino.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt pulled out because the U.S. could no longer afford to keep troops in the country due to the  Great Depression. The second intervention in Nicaragua would become one of the longest wars in United States history. The United States left the US-friendly  Somoza family in charge, and in 1934 they would kill Sandino.  [32]\n   During the  Mexican revolution, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico,  Henry Lane Wilson backed the  coup d&#39;\u00e9tat of 1913, which deposed then assassinated democratically elected president  Francisco I. Madero, leading to the military rule of  Victoriano Huerta, which was not recognised by the US. Later, in April 1914, the USA army  invaded Veracruz and occupied it for 7 months, helping to trigger Huerta&#39;s resignation and the restoration of democratic government under  Venustiano Carranza. And later in 1916  USA invaded Mexico through the northern border in an attempt to kill  Pancho Villa and his revolutionary army.\n    The U.S.  occupied  Haiti from 1915 to 1934. U.S.-based banks had lent money to Haiti and the banks requested U.S. government intervention. In an example of &#34; gunboat diplomacy,&#34; the U.S. sent its navy to intimidate to get its way.  [33] Eventually, in 1917, the U.S. installed a new government and dictated the terms of a new Haitian  constitution of 1917 that instituted changes that included an end to the prior ban on land ownership by non-Haitians. The  Cacos (military group) were originally armed militias of formerly enslaved persons who rebelled and took control of mountainous areas following the  Haitian Revolution in 1804. Such groups fought a guerrilla war against the U.S. occupation in what were known as the &#34; Caco Wars.&#34;  [34]\n    U.S. marines invaded the  Dominican Republic and  occupied it from 1916 to 1924, and this was preceded by US military interventions in 1903, 1904, and 1914. The  US Navy installed its personnel in all key positions in government and controlled the Dominican army and police.  [35] Within a couple of days, the constitutional president,  Juan Isidro Jimenes, resigned.  [36]\n  After the release of the  Zimmermann Telegram the United States joined the  First World War on April 6, 1917, declaring war on the  German Empire, a  monarchy.  [37] The Wilson Administration made a requirement of surrender be the abdication of the Kaiser and the creation of a German Republic.  Woodrow Wilson had made U.S. policy to &#34;Make the World Safe for Democracy&#34;. Germany surrendered November 11, 1918.  [38]  Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on November 28, 1918.  [39] While the United States did not ratify it, the  Treaty of Versailles in 1919 had much input from the United States. It mandated for Kaiser Wilhelm II to be removed from the government and tried, though the second part was never carried out.  [40] Germany would then become the  Weimar Republic, a  liberal democracy. The United States signed the  U.S.-German peace Treaty in 1921, solidifying the agreements made previously to the rest of the  Entente with the U.S.  [41]\n   On December 7, 1917, the United States declared war on  Austria-Hungary, a  monarchy, as part of World War I.  [42] Austria-Hungary surrendered on November 3, 1918.  [43]  Austria became a republic and signed  Treaty of Saint Germain in 1919 effectively dissolving Austria-Hungary.  [44] The Treaty disallowed Austria to ever unite with Germany. Even though the United States had much effect on the treaty it did not ratify it and instead signed the  U.S.-Austrian Peace Treaty in 1921, solidifying their new borders and government to the United States.  [45] After brief civil strife,  Hungary became a monarchy without a monarch, instead governed by a  Regent. Hungary signed the  Treaty of Trianon, in 1920 with the Entente, without the United States.  [46] They signed the  U.S.-Hungarian Peace Treaty in 1921 solidifying their status and borders with the United States.  [47]\n    In 1918 the U.S. military took part in the  Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War to support  White movement and overthrow the  Bolsheviks.  [48]  President Wilson  agreed to send 5,000  United States Army troops in the campaign. This force, which became known as the &#34;American North Russia Expeditionary Force&#34;  [49] (a.k.a. the  Polar Bear Expedition) launched the  North Russia Campaign from  Arkhangelsk, while another 8,000 soldiers, organised as the  American Expeditionary Force Siberia,  [50] launched the  Siberia intervention from  Vladivostok.  [51] The forces were withdrawn in 1920.\n     In 1931  Arnulfo Arias overthrew democratically elected liberal president  Florencio Harmodio Arosemena and put his brother  Harmodio Arias Madrid into power. In 1940, Arias became the president of Panama. While the United States had not yet entered the war, tensions were already increasing with the  Axis. The United States knew that if war broke out, which it most likely would and did, the Panama canal would be strategically important and were worried about Arias being in power. The United States government used its contacts in the  Panama National Guard, which the U.S. had earlier trained, to back a coup against the government of Panama in October 1941. The U.S. had requested that the government of Panama allow it to build over 130 new military installations inside and outside of the  Panama Canal Zone, and the government of Panama refused this request at the price suggested by the U.S.  [52] President Arnulfo Arias fled the country and  Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia Arango, the leader of the coup and a friend of the US government, became president, serving until the return of democratic government in 1945.  [53]\n    In December 1941, the US joined the  Allies in  war against the  Empire of Japan, a monarchy. After the Allied victory, Japan was occupied by Allied forces under the command of American general  Douglas MacArthur. In 1946, the  Japanese Diet ratified a new  Constitution of Japan that followed closely a &#39;model copy&#39; prepared by MacArthur&#39;s command,  [54] and was promulgated as an amendment to the old  Prussian-style  Meiji Constitution. The constitution renounced aggressive war and was accompanied by liberalization of many areas \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-17 13:27:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "How do you improve the performance of the software you write?Consolidating data into contiguous regions of address space is a generally useful approach because most programs are bottlenecked on memory access.The consolidation has a positive impact on performance because processors fetch data in cache lines, for two reasons.\n A contiguous and aligned layout minimises the total number of cache lines required to store the program data.\n  The likelihood that data for subsequent operations is already in a cache line is increased by a dense layout.\n The benefits are kind of obvious, but it takes some work to profit from this when using the JVM because of the layout of the heap.One way to think about Java objects laid out throughout the heap is to think of a sausage; amidst the innards and the breadcrumbs there is a bit of meat. Java objects have headers of implementation defined size, usually 12 or 16 bytes, and are aligned, by default, on 8 byte boundaries.This means if you have an array of objects which wrap a  long:\n  Even assuming compressed references, you end up with the composition of a typical sausage: 12 bytes for the header, eight bytes for the word, four bytes of  alignment shadow.That\u2019s 33% meat.\n For more details about JVM object layout, read Aleksey Shipil\u00ebv\u2019s  objects inside out.\n If you have a collection of these  WordMask objects, this will impact application performance in the two ways mentioned before:\n Three times more memory needs to be addressed and fetched to process the entire collection than is strictly necessary.\n  If a cache line is 64 bytes, eight  longs could fit, but only two entire  WordMask objects.\n The way around this - and there\u2019s a lot written about it - is to transpose the object graph so that you don\u2019t have collections of wrappers but a wrapper of an array:\n  Assuming compressed references again, this means you have 12 bytes of header, four bytes of array length, the data, and then 0-7 bytes of shadow at the end.The relative space wasted quickly becomes negligible as the array grows.People really do this (though often off-heap) to improve performance.\n  I have a toy project called  multi matcher which, given some classification rules, allows the construction of a decision tree which, when queried, will give all the classifications which apply to an input object.To my horror, I occasionally hear from people who are using it, or trying to.I wrote about what it does and how it works in another  post, but it\u2019s not really important.Recently I decided to improve its performance by improving the layout of its data, and, predictably got better than 2x performance gains from consolidation.\n How far can you take this approach before you start running in to other problems?Once you have consolidated all your data and increased the likelihood that it fits densely in cache, you probably want to exploit SIMD.What if the object you started off with contained an array rather than a single field:\n   The basic - and very simple - idea in multi-matcher is to assign an integer identity to each rule and decompose the set of rules by constraint.The evaluation starts off by assuming all rules apply by setting all the bits in a bit set.Then, values are extracted from the classified object and used to access the set of rules which accept the value.This set is intersected with the bit set.If the bit set becomes empty, the evaluation terminates.When there are no more values to extract, the bits left in the bit set are the rules which accept the input.\n  long [][]  masks ;  public  void  match ( long []  stillMatching ,  int  id )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  stillMatching . length ;  ++ i )  {  stillMatching [ i ]  &amp;=  masks [ id ][ i ];  }  }\n  long []  masks ;  int  size ;  public  void  match ( long []  stillMatching ,  int  id )  {  int  offset  =  id  *  size ;  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  stillMatching . length ;  ++ i )  {  stillMatching [ i ]  &amp;=  masks [ i  +  offset ];  }  }\n   C2 can autovectorise some code, such as the very simple loop above.The compiler does some analysis when it unrolls the loop, and notices blocks of the same instructions which don\u2019t depend on each other except in the value of the induction variable.Some blocks of instructions can be replaced with special instructions which operate on vectors of several elements at once; it depends on the availability of a vector counterpart instruction.When this is successful, the code is much faster, and is especially effective when the input data is in cache. Vladimir Ivanov has  slides on the topic.\n I happened to know there was a limitation in C2\u2019s autovectorisation when there are dynamic offsets into arrays.I knew this because I had encountered it  investigating a weak matrix multiplication baseline and Vladimir actually explained in a comment what the problem was:\n \u201cRegarding C2 auto-vectorization issue, it\u2019s a limitation in current implementation: compiler can\u2019t prove different vectorized accesses won\u2019t alias if index differs, so it gives up to preserve correctness (if aliasing happens, then different memory accesses can overlap and interfere which changes observable behavior).\n  The task in Java is simpler than in C/C++, but still it has to prove that source/destination arrays are different objects.\n  There\u2019s a develop flag -XX:+SuperWordRTDepCheck (not available in product binaries, requires JVM recompilation), but it misses proper implementation (ptr comparisons) and just enables vectorization in such case.\u201d\n The comment did not survive migrating my blog to Github Pages, but I still have it in my email inbox and getting information like this directly from an expert like Vladimir is great.\n What this means is that the code above can only be vectorised safely if the arrays certainly differ or if the vector width divides the offset.If there\u2019s an offset, the compiler needs to  prove that the arrays are different, and instead C2 just gives up rather than do the wrong thing.\n I wrote a quick benchmark to convince myself that pursuing better locality by flattening a  long[][] would be counter-productive.The results are noisy because they were run on an otherwise busy laptop (Ubuntu 18, JDK11, Skylake mobile class CPU). The point was to show that avoiding the offset would be much better; outside any reasonable measurement error, and I was more interested in checking the disassembly anyway.\n Benchmark (offset) (sourceSize) (targetSize) Mode Cnt Score Error Unitsintersection 0 1024 256 thrpt 5 6.118 \u00b1 1.049 ops/usintersection 256 1024 256 thrpt 5 8.025 \u00b1 1.413 ops/usintersection 512 1024 256 thrpt 5 6.099 \u00b1 1.363 ops/usintersection 768 1024 256 thrpt 5 8.005 \u00b1 1.472 ops/usintersectionNoOffset 0 1024 256 thrpt 5 13.596 \u00b1 1.724 ops/us\n This difference is (partially - there\u2019s more to this post) explained by autovectorisation when there is no offset.Here with no offset ( reference).\n 5.26% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2197\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6aa0: vmovdqu 0x10(%r11,%rdx,8),%ymm0 3.10% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6aa7: vpand 0x10(%r8,%rdx,8),%ymm0,%ymm0 12.08% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6aae: vmovdqu %ymm0,0x10(%r8,%rdx,8) 2.94% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6ab5: vmovdqu 0x30(%r11,%rdx,8),%ymm0 9.36% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6abc: vpand 0x30(%r8,%rdx,8),%ymm0,%ymm0 14.32% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6ac3: vmovdqu %ymm0,0x30(%r8,%rdx,8) 2.34% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6aca: vmovdqu 0x50(%r11,%rdx,8),%ymm0 2.00% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6ad1: vpand 0x50(%r8,%rdx,8),%ymm0,%ymm0 12.54% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6ad8: vmovdqu %ymm0,0x50(%r8,%rdx,8) 1.34% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6adf: vmovdqu 0x70(%r11,%rdx,8),%ymm0 0.24% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6ae6: vpand 0x70(%r8,%rdx,8),%ymm0,%ymm0 15.32% \u2502\u2502\u2502 \u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f844c3f6aed: vmovdqu %ymm0,0x70(%r8,%rdx,8)\n  \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f6699: mov 0x10(%rax,%r13,8),%r10 0.50% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f669e: and %r10,0x10(%r9,%rsi,8) 16.95% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66a3: mov 0x18(%rax,%r13,8),%r10 1.01% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66a8: and %r10,0x18(%r9,%rsi,8) 18.76% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66ad: mov 0x20(%rax,%r13,8),%r10 1.83% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66b2: and %r10,0x20(%r9,%rsi,8) 19.30% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66b7: mov 0x28(%rax,%r13,8),%r10 1.63% \u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502\u2502 0x00007f5afc3f66bc: and %r10,0x28(%r9,%rsi,8)\n The results above confirmed my beliefs adequately, but this is where it actually gets interesting.Look at the pattern in the throughput as a function of offset; high at 256 and 768; low at 0 and 512. Whilst these measurements are very poor quality, there\u2019s more to the pattern than noise. This leads to an interesting benchmarking pitfall relating to precise data layouts called  4K aliasing.\n  The pattern above - and I present some better measurements below - is caused by something called 4K aliasing which only happens on Intel hardware.When the processor loads data from memory, the load comes through a queue called the  load buffer; when it writes data back out to memory it goes through the  store buffer.The buffers are basically independent.In principle, any ordering of load and store events could be possible, just as if you implemented a pair of unsynchronised queues in software without taking measures to ensure ordering guarantees are met.The kinds of ordering guarantees made by these buffers determine the architecture\u2019s  memory model.\n On x86 processors (like mine), the store and load buffers are each FIFO (this is not true on ARM, for instance).Stores cannot be reordered with older loads, but loads may be reordered with older stores  if the address is different.The ability to reorder some of the loads with older stores is good for program performance and makes basic sense; the pending store couldn\u2019t possibly change the data being loaded as it\u2019s going to a different address.This just allows data to be loaded without waiting for an unrelated store to complete, which could take several cycles. Disallowing reordering of loads and older stores to the same address means that if, for whatever reason, a write  must store to memory rather than to a register, the program will slow down and bottleneck on storing to that memory address.\n How is this enforced?Whenever there is a load, it must be checked whether there is a pending store to the same address.If there is one, it means that the load must be stale: an earlier instruction, according to program order, should have already modified the data at that address.It\u2019s just an implementation detail that the write hasn\u2019t completed yet.The load needs to wait until the right data can be read, and is reissued.\n The way Intel processors do this is by querying the store buffer for a pending store to the load\u2019s address.If there is a match, the load is reissued, but the match is determined by checking the  lower 12 bits of the address!This means that whenever there is a recent store to an address at any offset $2^{12}$ bytes or 4KB away from one being loaded, then the pending store aliases with the load.So the load will be spuriously reissued, slowing the program down by a few cycles every time this happens.\n  This all means that benchmarks like the one above, where data from one array is written to another, are at risk of producing wildly different numbers depending on the precise locations at which data resides in memory.The variation due to location dependent effects can actually be very high.To illustrate this point, I wrote a more complex benchmark which implicitly varies the addresses of the allocated arrays.I was also curious to know if autovectorisation would also be disabled if the offset were static final, so included benchmarks with constants to match the dynamic offsets.\n The simplest way to do this is to allocate an array between the two arrays, though this limits the smallest possible offset to the size of the array header.The array\u2019s header and data will be allocated into a TLAB in between the two arrays. Since Java objects are 8 byte aligned by default, it doesn\u2019t make sense to measure offsets smaller than a  long. To make sure the arrays are not moved by garbage collection, I use EpsilonGC.I use JOL to record the addresses of the arrays just so I can check that the arrays are at the relative offsets I think they are.\n In the benchmark below, the 1024 element  source will be allocated somewhere, it doesn\u2019t matter where, and will take up 8KB ignoring its (irrelevant) header. Then the padding array will be allocated, which will take up between 16 bytes and 2KB of space between the  source and  target array.The  target is always 2KB.Since  source is allocated before  target, when there is a zero offset into  source, there should be between an 8KB-10KB distance between the read and the write.So 4K aliasing effects should be seen at the start of the range but not the end.When the offset is 256, the difference is 6KB-8KB; 4K aliasing should show up at the end but not the start, and so on.To prove 4K aliasing is happening, the counter  ld_blocks_partial.address_alias can be tracked with  -prof perfnorm.\n public  class  LogicalAggregationBenchmark  {  public  static  void  main ( String ...  args )  {  for  ( int  i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  256 ;  ++ i )  {  System . out . println ( &#34;\\&#34;&#34;  +  i  +  &#34;\\&#34;, &#34; );  }  }  @State ( Scope .

Thishappened despite members of Freenode staff participating in the community meeting, as well as reassuring us publicly andprivately that they would respect and support the resulting review andour decision. These channels were seized without informing the FSF orGNU representatives of any disagreements Freenode staff had with ourplan, whether by means of the group contact system or otherwise.Adding to the situation&#39;s instability was their switch to a new IRCdaemon late last night, also without notice, which dropped allexisting nicks and channels from the database.\n This has forced us to adjust our plans for the transition, a move thatwas already necessary due to an abrupt change in Freenode policy thatoccurred shortly after our announcement, which eliminated thedistinction between # and ## channels that we planned to use to passownership of the #fsf and #gnu channels over to the wider freesoftware community.\n After several additional meetings of the working group FSF and GNUformed to investigate this issue, we announce the following changes:\n The #fsf and #gnu channels on the Freenode network are to be considered unofficial and will not be moderated by FSF staff or GNU volunteers.\n So as not to mislead users, who might otherwise think that the #fsf and #gnu channels on Freenode are the official channels for our organizations, the irc.gnu.org alias is being retired effective immediately. Instead, it is now pointed at a server of ours that will give notice of our migration to the Libera.Chat network to IRC clients that attempt to connect to it.\n In light of these events, we would like to reiterate our call for GNUmaintainers to move their channels away from the Freenode network,whether to a self-hosted server, alternate IRC networks such asHackint or Libera.Chat, or other networks that fit the  criteriawe devised for our decision.

Because we lose a lot of detail to the ravages of time, it&#39;s very difficult for geology to get small again\u2014to tell us about what happened in individual locations or over short periods of time.\n So it&#39;s not every day that you read a scientific paper titled &#34;The first day of the Cenozoic.&#34; The Cenozoic is the name  geologists give to the era spanning the last 66 million years, and it started with the mass extinction event that killed off (most of) the dinosaurs. There were incredible eruptions that contributed to the extinction event and spanned a considerable amount of time.\n But the asteroid that struck off the coast of what is the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula today was the opposite\u2014it couldn&#39;t have been much more sudden. A recent drilling project recovered a long core of rock from the Chicxulub impact crater, leading to greater clarity about how the calamity played out\u2014including on that first day.\n  Big enough impact craters actually have a knob of uplifted rock in the center that forms due to the incredible shock forces involved. But the very largest impacts\u2014like Chicxulub\u2014end up with a  ring of uplifted rock around the center, as if to mark the bulls-eye. Computer modeling, supported by observations of the deepest bedrock in the core, shows that the rock would have bounced around like jelly. Over 10 minutes or so, a new mountain would have soared into the sky before collapsing and spreading out into a raised ring on the crater floor.\n    Higher up in the core, a layer of seafloor sediment seems to  record a miraculous return of small critters to the crater within just a couple of years.\n Between the jellified granite and the brave plankton fossils lies about 130 meters of chaotic rock. A team of researchers led by the University of Texas at Austin&#39;s Sean Gulick have analyzed that rock and produced a timeline of that impossibly violent day. They threw just about every tool available at the rock core, including X-ray techniques that image it and identify minerals, to a machine-learning analysis that identified trends in the visible shards of rock, to measurements of magnetism.\n The first layer above the messed-up bedrock that formed the peak ring is made up of 40m of broken pieces of melted rock. The researchers say this material was likely flowing out from the center of the crater for some tens of minutes after the impact. It settled into place while it was still hot, and the tiny crystals of magnetite in this rock are all aligned with Earth&#39;s magnetic field at that time.\n  The next layer up contains about 10m of pieces of melt in addition to shocked bedrock that was blasted out (roughly) intact. The researchers say this actually appears to be the first part of the &#34;resurge&#34; deposit\u2014material that flowed with seawater as it rushed back into the crater and over the peak ring. Modeling shows that the tsunami generated during the impact would have bounced off the nearest Central American coastline and returned in about an hour. Apart from pushing stuff around, this water probably also caused some explosions as it encountered still-hot melted rock.\n    The next 80m of rock up from there shows the first signs of order. From the bottom of this layer toward the top, the pieces get smaller and less jagged, indicating that tumbled rocks and sediment were more gradually settling out of the water column. This is topped off by a 10cm-thick layer of sand and gravel deposited in ripples, indicating a flow of water with a consistent direction. The researchers interpret this as a later tsunami wave return from the Gulf of Mexico several hours after impact.\n  The uppermost materials contain combustion byproducts called PAHs and even some charcoal, which likely represents residue from wildfires on land. It&#39;s believed that the impact may have started wildfires worldwide, contributing to the particulate matter that blocked out the Sun and sent temperatures plunging.\n While 30% to 50% of the rock struck by the Chicxulub impactor was made up of evaporite deposits like salt and gypsum, almost none of that material is found in the core. That provides more support for the idea that these minerals were vaporized, sending massive amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere where it could form sunlight-blocking particles. Much of the rest of the bedrock was limestone, which would have released CO 2, causing the long-term global warming that followed after the short-lived sulfur particles washed out of the atmosphere.\n In a world where a centimeter of sediment can take centuries to accumulate, the fact that 130  meters of material was deposited in a day is remarkable. More importantly, it gives you no shortage of clues to look through to learn about one of the wildest events in the geologic record\u2014and the first day of the Cenozoic Era.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 11:18:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53d1\u751f,impact,\u5ca9\u77f3", "title": "\u5728DINOS\u4e2d\u7684\u90a3\u5929\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u51b2\u51fb\u706b\u5c71\u53e3\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff082019\u5e74\uff09 ", "title_en": "What happened in the impact crater the day it did in the dinos (2019)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/heres-what-happened-in-the-impact-crater-the-day-it-did-in-the-dinos/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u751f", "impact", "\u5ca9\u77f3"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4b5f14c37a4af26c965efa6afa85fafa.png", "infoid": 1066373, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6761\u7eb9\u9605\u8bfb\u5668M2\u652f\u6301EMV\u82af\u7247\uff0c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u548c\u5237\u5361\u4ed8\u6b3e\u3002 \u5b83\u662f\u7535\u6c60\u4f9b\u7535\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u84dd\u7259\u4e0a\u4e0e\u60a8\u7684\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e8eGo-Go-Go\u4f7f\u7528\u3002  \u6761\u7eb9\u8bfb\u5361\u5668M2\u662fEMV\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\uff0c\u9644\u5e26\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08E2EE\uff09\u5f00\u7bb1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u70b9\u52a0\u5bc6\uff08P2PE\uff09\u5c31\u7eea\u3002  \u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u914d\u4ef6\u8f7b\u677e\u5c06\u6761\u5e26\u9605\u8bfb\u5668M2\u5b89\u88c5\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5176\u4e0a\u53f0\u4f7f\u7528\u3002 \u60a8\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u4ef6\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u914d\u4ef6\u3002  \u6761\u7eb9\u8bfb\u8005M2\u4e0e\u7ec8\u7aef\u548c\u5176\u4f59\u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u5e73\u53f0\u914d\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u652f\u4ed8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u7ed3\u7b97\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u7b49\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u3002 ", "note_en": "Stripe Reader M2 supports EMV chip, contactless, and swipe payments.
