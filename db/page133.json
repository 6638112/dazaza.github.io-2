"note_en": "The award for \u201cBest Small Talk on a Flight to Space\u201d goes to Oliver Daemen, the 18-year-old from the Netherlands who was part of Blue Origin\u2019s   inaugural crewed flight to space earlier this week. On the roughly 10-minute flight, Daemon told Amazon founder Jeff Bezos what probably sounded like blasphemy to his billionaire ears: He had never bought anything on Amazon.\n  In an   interview with Reuters on Friday, Daemen recounted his first flight to space, from when he got the call asking him if he was interested to the conversations he had with his crewmates, which included Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, and 82-year-old pilot Wally Funk. Daemen, whose father is the CEO of a private equity firm in the Netherlands, became the youngest person to ever fly to space, while Funk became the oldest.\n The teen also holds the distinction of surprising Bezos, whose Amazon empire has made him one of the richest men in the world.\n    \u201cI told Jeff, like, I\u2019ve actually never bought something from Amazon,\u201d Daemen told Reuters. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018oh, wow, it\u2019s [been] a long time [since] I heard someone say that.\u2019\u201d\n  Considering that Bezos thanked   \u201cevery Amazon employee and every Amazon customer\u201d for making the flight possible after he and the crew returned to Earth, Daemen\u2019s comments may have been a little awkward. However, it\u2019s nice (and kind of funny) to hear that someone was frank with him. Bezos no doubt has enough people telling him that Amazon is God\u2019s gift to humanity, so it\u2019s cool to see one of the youths set him straight.\n   Daemen wasn\u2019t originally supposed to go on the flight with Bezos and crew. He was offered the opportunity after the winner of the online auction for the seat, whose identity is still unknown and who paid a whopping $28 million for it, said they couldn\u2019t go because of   \u201cscheduling conflicts.\u201d Daemen, who was a participant in the auction and had already secured a spot on the second flight, was then moved up on the list. His father, Joes Daemen,   paid for the seat.\n According to Daemen, his family didn\u2019t pay anything near what the mysterious bidder paid for the opportunity.\n  \u201cWe didn\u2019t pay even close to $28 million, but they chose me because I was the youngest and I was also a pilot and I also knew quite a lot about it already,\u201d he said.\n The teen, who will begin his studies at Utrecht University in September, said he wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to do professionally, but would consider focusing on space travel. He also told the outlet that his fellow travelers were \u201csuper fun and all down to Earth.\u201d Well, considering Daemen\u2019s referring to a man that wants to stupidly   move all polluting industry into space, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m sold on that.", "posttime": "2021-07-24 12:53:06", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8d1d\u4f50\u65af,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u592a\u7a7a,amazon,teen", "title": "\u4e0e\u8d1d\u4f50\u65af\u4e00\u8d77\u53bb\u592a\u7a7a\u7684\u8377\u5170\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u4ece\u672a\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e0a\u4e70\u8fc7\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f", "title_en": "Dutch Teen Who Went to Space with Bezos Told Him Never Bought Anything on Amazon", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/dutch-teen-who-went-to-space-with-jeff-bezos-told-him-h-1847354287", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d1d\u4f50\u65af", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u592a\u7a7a", "amazon", "teen"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9aea7ea3ba8b167614da0ba3f25fa355.png", "infoid": 1069411, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u590d\u5236\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f2b\u753b\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u51fa\u552e\u5b83\u4eec\uff09\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "note_en": "This means you&#39;re free to copy and share these comics (but not to sell them).

consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on a scale that&#39;s become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up.\n  Facing an ongoing drought that is squeezing surface water supplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual.\n  California&#39;s farmers probably will pump an additional six to seven million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according to  Josue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000 square miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.\n  &#34;It&#39;s a huge amount,&#34;says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. &#34;I&#39;d say 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.&#34;\n    This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California&#39;s great groundwater grab. The state is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on the state&#39;s farmers.\n  California is a powerhouse of food production, growing some 40 percent of the country&#39;s fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on a supply of water that&#39;s increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.\n  &#34;Drought reveals the lie of a place,&#34; says Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author of  The Dreamt Land, a history of California&#39;s water conflicts. &#34;The lie is our ambition. We&#39;ve taken on too much.&#34;\n  In good years, an intricate system of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and melting snow, much of it in the northern part of the state, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. The system also supplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water.\n  This year, rivers are running low. The state&#39;s biggest reservoirs contain  less than half the average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. &#34;This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,&#34; says Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, and she&#39;s relying on her wells instead.\n    Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that water source seemed inexhaustible.\n  The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. &#34;A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,&#34; Arax says. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep.\n  But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extracting so much water even changed the region&#39;s geology.&#34;As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself then collapses and sinks,&#34; Arax says. &#34;We&#39;re not sinking by inches. We&#39;re sinking by feet.&#34;\n    Briano says the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. &#34;Everybody was pumping,&#34; she says. &#34;You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.&#34;\n  On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well that supplied water to her house went dry. The same thing happened to hundreds of people who relied on shallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. &#34;People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!&#34; she says.\n  During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of the  Community Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. &#34;When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to be sure that we&#39;re sharing that for all beneficial uses,&#34; she says. &#34;That means that we should not over-pump.&#34;\n  In 2014, California passed the  Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades.\n  Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of the state&#39;s groundwater must be in balance.\n  State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they&#39;re using this year.\n  In order to enforce these limits, some authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use through satellites that can detect which crops are being grown.\n  The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. &#34;It is a lifeline, but I think that it&#39;s a lifeline that we&#39;ve all taken for granted, and it&#39;s not infinite,&#34;he says. &#34;I think that&#39;s what&#39;s coming home to all of us.&#34;\n  The limits probably will mean that some land will no longer grow crops, although there&#39;s dispute about how much. One study, backed by the agricultural industry,  predicts that a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchers  think it will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt by shifting their limited water supplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy and sell groundwater allotments, shifting the water to the places where it&#39;s worth the most.\n  Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makes sense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it, she wants the state to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to which she says the farms are entitled. &#34;My solution is, you need to bring us more water,&#34; she says. &#34;We can&#39;t keep taking from the valley, because we&#39;re taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!&#34;\n  Mark Arax, the writer, says the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country. &#34;How we deal with this becomes an example for the rest of America, when it comes to their doorstep,&#34; he says.\n  The California dream was born in the Gold Rush, claiming nature and re-shaping the land. Now, Arax says, it&#39;s time to re-invent that dream.", "posttime": "2021-07-24 12:14:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

accepting assistance and fewer people sent to the hospital,  early data shows.\n  It&#39;s one of  a number of programs underway around the country trying to address police violence and systemic racism  following George Floyd&#39;s murder by providing alternatives to sending law enforcement to respond to emergency calls involving issues such as mental health or drug and alcohol crises.\n     In June, New York City started its Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, or B-HEARD, to provide more targeted care for those struggling with mental health issues and emergencies such as suicide attempts, substance misuse and serious mental illness.\n  During the first month of the pilot program, B-HEARD teams \u2014 consisting of fire department paramedics and social workers \u2014 responded to calls in northern Manhattan, which includes parts of Harlem and receives the city&#39;s highest number of mental health emergency calls.\n  From June 6 to July 7, B-HEARD received roughly 16 mental health calls each day in this zone.\n       In 95% of cases, people accepted care from the B-HEARD team, data from the city shows. That&#39;s compared with 82% for traditional 911 response teams, which include police.\n  Additionally, 50% of people treated by B-HEARD were transported to the hospital for more care, a far lower number than the 82% who are transported to the hospital with traditional 911 response.\n  The city said that 911 operators routed 138 mental health emergency calls \u2014 25% of the number of calls during the pilot period \u2014 to B-HEARD and expect that number to grow to 50% in the coming months.\n  &#34;This is great news. A smarter approach to public health and public safety. A smarter use of resources. And the evidence \u2014 from Denver to New York \u2014 shows that responding with care works,&#34; U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y.,  tweeted.\n     New York&#39;s program is modeled after a successful, decades-old program in Eugene, Ore., known as Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, or  CAHOOTS. Other similar programs have launched in California, Colorado, Georgia and Montana.\n  In Minneapolis, where police killed Floyd last summer, the city will start sending out  civil crisis response teams instead of police to certain mental health calls next month.\n  Mental health-related calls accounted for  22% of cases in which on-duty police used lethal force and killed someone, according to data from 2009 to 2012 from 17 states where data was available.", "posttime": "2021-07-24 12:14:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

hours. The GPU is not exactly fully functional, as it cannot yet run games, but it can render the GUI, 3D elements and also decode hi-res videos.\n Back when  Nvidia was announcing the intentions to buy ARM and many industry analysts immediately expressed their concern regarding the status of the ARM architecture that might not remain open source for too long,  SiFive came out with a big push for its RISC-V CPU architecture as a true open source alternative. Similar to the Windows-on-ARM initiative, SiFive promised to deliver a general use PC platform that would allow software developers to adapt the Windows and Linux-based code for the RISC-V processors. It only took SiFive a few months to launch its first PC motherboard called the  HiFive Unmatched, which is based on the U7 SoC. However, since the RISC-V community is not that big, development on the PC platform is not exactly fast. Interestingly enough,  Nvidia recently managed to enable RTX 3000 support for ARM-based laptops, and, almost at the same time, a RISC-V enthusiast managed to make an  AMD RX 6700 XT work on Linux-based HiFive Unmatched system.\n This is essentially a double milestone for the RISC-V community. Hackster.io reports that computer scientist Ren\u00e9 Rebe first managed to make the HiFive Unmatched run Linux, and then added support for the Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU through the Mesa Gallium 21.1.5 driver. Apparently, the U7 SoC is not properly supported in Linux, but Rebe was able to work his magic and patched the Linux kernel to support both the RISC-V architecture and the  RDNA2 GPU in around 10 hours. The GPU is not fully functional as of yet. It can display the GUI, can render 3D graphics in accelerated-mode and also decode hi-res videos, but cannot run games. Nevertheless, this is still an impressive achievement that is not facilitated by the SiFive team itself.\n With a bit more work, RISC-V can become a serious alternative for the ARM and even the X64 architectures. The HiFIve Unmatched already offers support for most of the popular PC interfaces like PCIe 3.0, M.2 and USB, so it all comes down to the CPU-specific coding advancements in order to enable broader compatibility with Linux and eventually Windows.", "posttime": "2021-07-24 12:13:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,based,risc", "title": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u53f0\u57fa\u4e8e RISC-V \u7684 Linux PC \u642d\u914d AMD RX 6700 XT GPU", "title_en": "First RISC-V-Based Linux PC Coupled with an AMD RX 6700 XT GPU", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-scientist-showcases-world-s-first-RISC-V-based-Linux-PC-coupled-with-an-AMD-RX-6700-XT-GPU.552002.0.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "based", "risc"]}]
