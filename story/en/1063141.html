Beunza wanted to know how they had run a trading desk while working from home. Did finance require flesh-and-blood humans?</p><p>2020年夏天，丹尼尔贝杜·丹尼尔·贝杜萨（Daniel Beunza）是一家在伦敦的Cass商学院授课，组织了一流的视频电话，在美国和欧洲有十几名高级银行家。 Beunza想知道他们在家里工作的同时运行交易台。财务是否需要血肉和血液？</p><p> Beunza had studied bank trading floors for two decades, and had noticed a paradox. Digital technologies had entered finance in the late 20th century, pushing markets into cyberspace and enabling most financial work to be done outside the office – in theory. “For $1,400 a month you can have the [Bloomberg] machine at home. You can have the best information, all the data at your disposal,” Beunza was told in 2000 by the head of one Wall Street trading desk, whom he called “Bob”. But the digital revolution had not caused banks’ offices and trading rooms to disappear. “The tendency is the reverse,” Bob said. “Banks are building bigger and bigger trading rooms.”</p><p> Beunza已经研究了银行交易楼两十年​​，并注意到了悖论。数字技术在20世纪后期进入了金融，将市场推向网络空间，并在办公室外面实现了大多数财务工作 - 理论上。 “每月1,400美元，您可以在家里拥有[布鲁姆伯格]机器。您可以拥有最好的信息，您所在的所有数据，“Beunza于2000年被一个墙街交易台的头部被告知，他称之为”Bob“。但数字革命没有导致银行的办公室和交易室消失。 “趋势是反面的，”鲍勃说。 “银行正在建设更大，更大的交易室。”</p><p>  Why?  Beunza had spent years watching financiers like Bob to find the answer. Now, during lockdown, many executives and HR departments found themselves dealing with the same issue: what is gained and what is lost when everyone is working from home? But while most finance companies focused on immediate questions such as whether employees working remotely would have still access to information, feel part of a team and be able to communicate with colleagues, Beunza thought more attention should be paid to different kinds of questions: how do people act as groups? How do they use rituals and symbols to forge a common worldview? To address practical concerns about the costs and benefits of remote working, we first need to understand these deeper issues.</p><p>  为什么？ Beunza花了几年看着像鲍勃这样的金融家找到答案。现在，在锁定期间，许多高管和人力资源部门发现自己处理相同的问题：在家里工作时，当每个人都在工作时丢失了什么？但是，虽然大多数金融公司专注于即时的问题，如员工是否仍然可以远程获取信息，但感受团队的一部分，并能够与同事沟通，Beunza想到更多的注意力应该支付不同类型的问题：怎么做人民作为群体？他们如何使用仪式和符号来伪造一个共同的世界观？为了解决对遥控工作的成本和益处的实际问题，我们首先需要了解这些更深层次的问题。</p><p> Office workers make decisions not just by using models and manuals or rational, sequential logic – but by pulling in information, as groups, from multiple sources. That is why the rituals, symbols and space matter. “What we do in offices is not usually what people think we do,” Beunza told me. “It is about how we navigate the world.” And these navigation practices are poorly understood by participants like financiers – especially in a digital age.</p><p> 办公室工作人员不仅通过使用模型和手册或合理的顺序逻辑 - 而是通过从多个来源中拉动信息的信息来进行决策。这就是为什么仪式，符号和空间问题。 “我们在办公室做了什么，通常是人们认为我们所做的事情，”Beunza告诉我。 “这是关于我们如何浏览世界。”这些导航措施与融资者这样的参与者很难理解 - 特别是在数字时代。</p><p> The engineers who created the internet have always recognised that people and their rituals matter. Since it was founded in 1986, the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has provided a place for people to meet and collectively design the architecture of the web. Its members wanted to make design decisions using “rough consensus”, since they believed the internet should be an egalitarian community where anybody could participate, without hierarchies or coercion. “We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code” was, and still is, one of its key mantras.</p><p> 创建互联网的工程师始终认识到人和他们的仪式问题。由于它成立于1986年，互联网工程工作组（IETF）为人们提供了一个迎接和集体设计网络架构的地方。其成员希望使用“粗略共识”来制定设计决策，因为他们认为互联网应该是任何人都可以参与的平等教育，而没有等级或胁迫。 “我们拒绝：国王，总统和投票。我们相信：粗略的共识和运行代码“是，仍然是它的主要咒语之一。</p><p> To cultivate “rough consensus”, IETF members devised a distinctive ritual:  humming. When they needed to make a crucial decision, the group asked everyone to hum to indicate “yay” or “nay” – and proceeded on the basis of which was loudest. The engineers considered this less divisive than voting.</p><p> 为了培养“粗略共识”，IETF成员设计了一个独特的仪式：哼唱。当他们需要做出至关重要的决定时，小组要求每个人都哼到“耶”或“缺点” - 并在最响亮的基础上进行。工程师认为这比投票少得多。</p><p>  Some of the biggest decisions about how the internet works have been made using this ritual. In March 2018, in a bland room of the Hilton Metropole on London’s Edgware Road, representatives from Google, Intel, Amazon, Qualcomm and others were gathered for an IETF meeting. They were debating a controversial issue: whether or not to adopt the “draft-rhrd-tls-tls13-visibility-01” protocol. To anybody outside the room, it might sound like gobbledegook, but this protocol was important. Measures were being introduced to make it harder for hackers to attack crucial infrastructure such as utility networks, healthcare systems and retail groups. This was a mounting concern at the time – a year or so earlier, hackers seemingly from Russia  had shut down the Ukrainian power system. The proposed “visibility” protocol would signal to internet users whether or not anti-hacking tools had been installed.</p><p>  一些关于如何使用此仪式进行互联网工作的最大决定。 2018年3月，在伦敦·埃格沃尔州希尔顿·埃格多尔路的Bland房间，谷歌，英特尔，亚马逊，高通公司和其他人的代表被聚集在一起为IETF会议。他们正在辩论一个有争议的问题：是否采用“草案 -  rhrd-tls-tls13-disibility-01”议定书。对于房间之外的任何人来说，它可能听起来像Gobbledocook，但这个协议很重要。正在介绍措施使黑客更难攻击公正的基础设施，如公用事业网络，医疗保健系统和零售集团。这是当时的一个令人关注的关注 - 一年左右，黑客似乎来自俄罗斯关闭了乌克兰电力系统。建议的“可见性”协议将向互联网用户发出信号，无论是否已安装防黑客工具。 </p><p> For an hour the engineers debated the protocol. Some opposed telling users the tools had been installed; others insisted on it. “There are privacy issues,” one said. “It’s about nation states,” another argued. “We cannot do this without consensus.” So a man named Sean Turner – who looked like a garden gnome, with a long, snowy-white beard, bald head, glasses and checked lumberjack shirt – invoked the IETF ritual.</p><p>一小时，工程师辩论了该协议。一些反对的告诉用户已安装工具;其他人坚持下去。 “有隐私问题，”一个人说。 “这是关于民族国家，另一位争论。 “我们不能在没有共识的情况下做到这一点。”所以一个名叫肖恩特纳的男人 - 谁看起来像一个花园侏儒，带有长长，雪白的胡子，秃头，眼镜和检查的伐木工衬衫 - 调用了IETF仪式。</p><p> “We are going to hum,” he said. “Please hum now if you support adoption.” A moan rose up, akin to a Tibetan chant, bouncing off the walls of the Metropole. “Thanks. Please hum now if you oppose.” There was a much louder collective hum. “So at this point there is no consensus to adopt this,” Turner declared. The protocol was put on ice.</p><p> “我们要哼哼，”他说。 “如果您支持采用，请立即嗡嗡声。”呻吟着升起，类似于藏族的吟唱，弹出了大都会的墙壁。 “谢谢。如果你反对，请现在哼哼。“有一个更响亮的集体嗡嗡声。 “所以在这一点上，没有共识是通过这一点，”特纳宣称。议定书被放在冰上。</p><p> Most people do not even know that the IETF exists, much less that computer engineers design the web by humming. That is not because the IETF hides its work. On the contrary, its meetings are open to anyone and  posted online. But phrases like “draft-rhrd-tls-tls1.3” mean most people instinctively look away, just as they did with derivatives before the 2008 financial crisis. And, as with finance, this lack of external scrutiny – and understanding – is alarming, particularly given the accelerating effects of innovations such as AI. Many of the engineers who build the technologies on which we rely are well-meaning. But they – like financiers – are prone to tunnel vision, and often fail to see that others may not share their mentality. “In a community of technological producers, the very process of designing, crafting, manufacturing and maintaining technology acts as a template and makes technology itself the lens through which the world is seen and defined,” observes Jan English-Lueck, an anthropologist who has studied Silicon Valley.</p><p> 大多数人甚至都不知道IETF存在，那么计算机工程师通过嗡嗡声设计网页。这不是因为IETF隐藏了它的工作。相反，它的会议对任何人开放并在线发布。但是，像“草案 -  rhrd-tls-tls1.3”这样的短语意味着大多数人本能地瞧不起，就像他们在2008年的金融危机面前的衍生品一样。而且，与金融一样，这种缺乏外部审查 - 和理解 - 令人震惊，特别是赋予AI等创新的影响。建立我们依赖的技术的许多工程师都是很好的。但是，他们就像金融家 - 易于隧道愿景，并且经常没有看到其他人可能不会分享他们的心态。 “在一个技术生产者社区中，设计，制作，制造和维护技术的过程充当了模板，使技术本身通过了世界所看到和定义的镜头，”观察一位人类学家Jan English-Lueck学习硅谷。</p><p> When the IETF members use humming, they are reflecting and reinforcing a distinctive worldview – their desperate hope that the internet should remain egalitarian and inclusive. That is their creation myth. But they are also signalling that human contact and context matter deeply, even in a world of computing. Humming enables them to collectively demonstrate the power of that idea. It also helps them navigate the currents of shifting opinion in their tribe and make decisions by reading a range of signals.</p><p> 当IETF成员使用嗡嗡声时，他们正在反思和加强一个独特的世界观 - 他们绝望希望互联网应该保持平等和包容性。这是他们的创造神话。但是，它们也发挥了人类的联系和情境，即使在一个计算世界中也是如此。嗡嗡声使他们能够集体展示该想法的力量。它还有助于他们通过读取一系列信号来导航在其部落中转移意见的电流。</p><p> Humming does not sit easily with the way we imagine technology, but it highlights a crucial truth about how humans navigate the world of work, in offices, online or anywhere else: even if we think we are rational, logical creatures, we make decisions in social groups by absorbing a wide range of signals. And perhaps the best way to understand this is to employ an idea popularised by anthropologists working at companies such as Xerox during the late 20th century, and since used by Beunza and others on Wall Street: “Sense-making”.</p><p> 嗡嗡声并不像我们想象技术的方式轻松坐下，但它强调了人类如何在办公室，在线或其他任何地方导航工作的关键真相：即使我们认为我们是理性的，逻辑生物，我们做出决定通过吸收各种信号来社会群体。也许是最好的理解方法是采用由在20世纪末施乐等公司在Xerox等公司工作的人类学家推广的想法，因为Beunza和Wall Street的其他人使用：“感觉制作”。</p><p>  O ne of the first thinkers to develop the concept of sense-making was a man named John Seely Brown. JSB, as he was usually known, was not trained as an anthropologist. He studied maths and physics in the early 60s, and finished a PhD in computer science in 1970, just as the idea of the internet was emerging, and then taught advanced computing science at the University of California, with a particular interest in AI. Around this time, after meeting some sociologists and anthropologists, he became fascinated by the question of how social patterns influence the development of digital tools, too.</p><p>  第一款思想家开发感觉制作概念的思想是一个名叫John的男人。 JSB，因为他通常知道，没有被作为人类学家培训。他在60年代初研究了数学和物理，并于1970年完成了计算机科学博士学位，正如互联网的想法正在新兴，然后在加利福尼亚大学教授先进的计算科学，对AI特别兴趣。在遇到一些社会学家和人类学家之后，他也被社会模式如何影响数字工具的发展的问题所迷住。</p><p> He applied for a research post at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), a research arm that the Connecticut-based company set up in Silicon Valley in 1969. Xerox was famous for developing the photocopier, but it also produced many other digital innovations. The authors of Fumbling the Future, a book about the history of the company, credits it with inventing “the first computer ever designed and built for the dedicated use of a single person … the first graphics-oriented monitor, the first handheld ‘mouse’ simple enough for a child, the first word-processing programme for non-expert users, the first local area communications network … and the first laser printer.”</p><p> 他在施乐的Palo Alto研究中心（PARC）申请了一个研究帖子，这是一项关于康涅狄格州的公司成立于1969年硅谷的研究部门。施乐公司以开发复印机而闻名，但它也产生了许多其他的数字创新。未来的作者，一本关于公司历史的书，它通过发明了“曾经设计的第一台电脑，为专门使用单个人而设计......第一个面向图形的监视器，第一个手持式”鼠标“对于一个孩子来说，对于非专家用户，第一本地通信网络和第一激光打印机的第一个文字处理程序。“ </p><p> During his application process to Parc, JSB met Jack Goldman, its chief scientist. The two men discussed Xerox’s research and development work, and its pioneering experiments with AI. Then JSB pointed to Goldman’s desk. “Jack, why two phones?” he asked. The desk contained both a “simple” phone and a newer, more sophisticated model.</p><p>在申请进程到PARC，JSB会见其首席科学家Jack Goldman。这两个人讨论了施乐的研发工作，以及艾美的先驱实验。然后JSB指向高盛的桌子。 “杰克，为什么两个手机？”他问。桌面包含“简单”手机和更新，更复杂的模型。</p><p> “Oh my God, who the hell can use this phone?” Goldman said, referring to the new phone. “I have it on my desk because everyone has to have one, but when real work gets done I’ve got to use a regular one.”</p><p> “哦，我的上帝，谁可以使用这款手机？”高盛表示，参考新手机。 “我有它在我的桌子上，因为每个人都必须拥有一个，但是当真正的工作完成时，我必须使用常规。”</p><p> That was exactly the kind of thing, Seely Brown said, that scientists at Xerox should also be researching: how humans were (or were not) using the dazzling innovations that Silicon Valley companies kept creating. Having started steeped in “hard” computing science, JSB realised that it paid to be a “softie” when looking at social science, or – to employ the buzzwords that were later popularised in Silicon Valley by the writer Scott Hartley – to be a techie and  a “fuzzy”.</p><p> 这正是那种东西，Seely Brown说，施乐的科学家也应该在研究：使用硅谷公司留下创造的令人眼花缭乱的创新，人类如何（或不是）。 jsb开始沉浸在“艰难”的计算科学中，意识到当看社会科学时，它被支付是“软菲”，或者 - 雇用后来在硅谷普通的流行者·斯科特哈特利普通 - 成为一个技术人员和一个“模糊”。</p><p> JSB joined Parc and put his new theories to work. Although the research centre had initially been dominated by scientists, by the time JSB arrived, a collection of anthropologists, psychologists and sociologists were also there. One of these anthropologists was a man named Julian Orr, who was studying the “tribe” of technical repair teams at Xerox.</p><p> JSB加入了PARC并将他的新理论付诸实施。虽然研究中心最初是由科学家统治的，但JSB到达时，人类学家，心理学家和社会学家也在那里。这些人类学家中的一个是一个名叫朱利安ORR的人，他正在研究施乐的技术维修团队的“部落”。</p><p>  By the late 20th century, copy machines were ubiquitous in offices. Work could collapse if one of these machines broke down. Xerox employed numerous people whose only job was to travel between offices, servicing and fixing machines. These technicians were routinely ignored, partly because the managers assumed that they knew what they did. But Orr and JSB suspected this was a big mistake, and that the technicians did not always think or behave as their bosses thought they should.</p><p>  到20世纪末，复印机在办公室中无处不在。如果其中一个机器崩溃，工作可能会崩溃。施乐雇用了许多人，唯一的工作是在办公室，维修和修理机之间旅行。这些技术人员经常被忽略，部分原因是经理假设他们知道他们所做的事情。但是ORR和JSB怀疑这是一个很大的错误，而技术人员并不总是认为或表现出他们的老板认为他们应该。</p><p> JSB first noticed it early in his time at Xerox, when he met a repairman known as “Mr Troubleshooter”, who said to him: “Well, Mr PhD, suppose this photocopier sitting here had an intermittent image quality fault, how would you go about troubleshooting it?”</p><p> JSB首先在Xerox早期注意到它，当他遇到一个被称为“Troubleshooter”的修理工时，谁对他说：“博士博士，假设这款复印机坐在这里有一个间歇性的图像质量错，你会如何进入关于故障排除吗？“</p><p> JSB knew there was an “official” answer in the office handbook: technicians were supposed to “print out 1,000 copies, sort through the output, find a few bad ones, and compare them to the diagnostic”. It sounded logical – to an engineer.</p><p> JSB知道办公手册中有一个“官方”答案：技术人员应该“打印出1000份，排序通过输出，找到一些坏的，并将它们与诊断进行比较”。它听起来逻辑 - 到工程师。 </p><p> “Here is what I do,” Mr Troubleshooter told JSB, with a “disgusted” look on his face. “I walk to the trash can, tip it upside down, and look at all the copies that have been thrown away. The trash can is a filter – people keep the good copies and throw the bad ones away. So just go to the trash can … and from scanning all the bad ones, interpret what connects them all.” In short, the engineers were ignoring protocols and using a solution that worked – but one that was “invisible … and outside [the] cognitive modelling lens” of the people running the company, JSB ruefully concluded.</p><p>“这是我所做的，”故障排除者先生告诉JSB，脸上的“厌恶”看。 “我走到垃圾桶，把它倒下来倒下，看看已经被扔掉的所有副本。垃圾桶可以是一个过滤器 - 人们保留好副本并将坏人扔掉。所以只需去垃圾桶......并且从扫描所有坏的垃圾，解释所有连接的东西。“简而言之，工程师忽略了协议并使用工作的解决方案 - 但其中一个是“看不见的......和外面的[”认知建模镜头“的运营公司，JSB Ruefly的结论。</p><p> How common was this kind of subversive approach? Orr set off to find out. He first enrolled in technical training school. Then he shadowed the repair teams out on service calls, at the parts depot, eating lunch and just hanging out when there was not much work to do. The fact that Orr had once worked as a technician himself helped in some respects: the repair crews welcomed him in. But it also created a trap: he sometimes had the same blind spots as the people he was studying. “I had a tendency to regard certain phenomena as unremarkable which are not really so to outsiders,” he later wrote in a report. He had to perform mental gymnastics to make “familiar” seem “strange”. So, like many other anthropologists before him, he tried to get that sense of distance by looking at the group rituals, symbols and spatial patterns that the technicians used in their everyday life.</p><p> 这种颠覆方法是多么常见？ ORR掀起了解。他首先参加了技术培训学校。然后他在服务电话上遮蔽了维修团队，在零件仓库，吃午饭，只是在没有多少工作的时候闲逛。 ORR曾经工作过的事实是在某些方面曾经有帮助的技术人员：修复工作人员对他感到欢迎。但它也创造了一个陷阱：他有时会像他学习的人一样与他所学习的人一样。 “我倾向于将某些现象视为不起眼的现象，这并不是真正的外在人，”他后来在一份报告中写道。他不得不表演精神体操，使“熟悉”似乎“奇怪”。所以，像他面前的许多其他人类学家一样，他试图通过看着他们日常生活中使用的技术人员的小组仪式，符号和空间模式来获得这种距离感。</p><p> Orr quickly realised that many of the most important interactions took place in diners. “I drive to meet the members of the customer support team for breakfast at a chain restaurant in a small city on the east side,” Orr observed in one of his field notes. “Alice has a problem: her machine reports a self-test error, but she suspects there is some other problem … [so] we are going to lunch at a restaurant where many of [Alice’s] colleagues eat, to try to persuade Fred, the most experienced [technician], to go to look at the machine with her … Fred tells her there is another component that she needs to change, according to his interpretation of the logs.” The repair teams were doing collective problem solving over coffee in those diners, using a rich body of shared narrative about the Xerox machines, and almost every other part of their lives. Their “gossip” was weaving a wide tapestry of group knowledge, and tapping into the collective views of the group – like the IETF humming.</p><p> ORR快速意识到，许多最重要的互动在食客中发生。 “我开车去迎接客户支持团队的成员，在东侧的一个小城市的一家连锁餐厅，”Orr在他的一个领域票据中观察。 “爱丽丝有一个问题：她的机器报告了一个自我测试错误，但她怀疑还有其他问题...... [所以]我们要在一家餐馆午餐，其中许多[Alice]的同事吃，试图说服弗雷德，最经验丰富的[技术员]，要去看看机器......弗雷德告诉她，根据他对日志的解释，她需要改变另一个组件。“维修团队正在通过关于施乐机的丰富的共同叙事，以及他们生活的几乎所有其他一部分的食客，在那些食客中解决了咖啡的集体问题。他们的“八卦”正在编织群体知识的宽带挂毯，并挖掘集团的集体观点 - 就像IETF嗡嗡声一样。</p><p> This knowledge mattered. The company protocols assumed that “the work of technicians was the rote repair of identical broken machines,” as Lucy Suchman, another anthropologist at Parc, noted. But that was a fallacy: even if the machines seemed identical when they emerged from the Xerox factory, by the time repairmen encountered the machines they had histories shaped by humans. What engineers shared at the diner was this history and context. “Diagnosis is a narrative process,” Orr said.</p><p> 这种知识问题。该公司议定书认为，“技术人员的工作是同型破损机器的死记硬背修复”，作为Parc的另一个人类学家露西如此。但那是一种谬论：即使当机器似乎与施乐工厂出现时似乎相同，当时修理官遇到机器，他们有人类塑造的历史。在餐馆共享的工程师是这个历史和背景。 “诊断是一个叙事过程，”ORR说。</p><p>  T he Xerox scientists eventually listened to the anthropologists – to some degree. After Orr issued his report on the technicians, the company introduced systems to make it easier for repair people to talk to one another in the field and share knowledge – even outside diners. A two-way radio system allowed tech reps in different regions to call on each other’s expertise. Xerox later supplemented these radios with a rudimentary messaging platform on the internet known as Eureka, where technicians could share tips. JSB viewed this as “an early model for social media platforms”.</p><p>  何施乐科学家最终听取了人类学家 - 一定程度。 ORR发布了他的技术人员的报告后，该公司介绍了系统，使人们更容易修理人们在现场互相交谈并分享知识 - 即使是外部食客。双向无线电系统允许不同地区的技术代表来呼吁彼此的专业知识。 Xerox后来通过称为Eureka的互联网上的基本消息平台补充了这些收音机，技术人员可以分享提示。 JSB认为这是“社交媒体平台的早期模型”。</p><p> Other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs became increasingly fascinated by what Parc was doing, and tried to emulate its ideas. Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple,  toured Parc in 1979, saw the group’s efforts to build a personal computer, and then developed something similar at Apple, hiring away a key Parc researcher. Other Parc ideas were echoed at Apple and other Silicon Valley companies. But Xerox’s managers were not nearly as adept as Jobs in terms of turning brilliant ideas into lucrative gadgets, and in subsequent decades Xerox’s fortunes ailed. That was partly because the company culture was conservative and slow-moving, but also because Parc was based on the west coast, while the main headquarters and manufacturing centres were on the other side of the country. Good ideas often fell between the cracks, to the frustration of Parc staff.</p><p> 其他硅谷企业家因Parc正在做的事情而越来越令人着迷，并试图刺激其想法。 1979年，Apple的联合创始人史蒂夫乔布斯（Apple）是Parc的一位博士，看到集团建立个人电脑的努力，然后在Apple开发了类似的东西，聘请了一个关键的Parc研究员。其他PARC的想法是在苹果和其他硅谷公司的回声。但施乐的经理在将辉煌的想法转变为有利可图的小工具方面并不像工作，并且在随后的数十年中，施乐的财富融合了。部分原因是公司文化是保守和缓慢的，而且还因为Parc是基于西海岸，而主要总部和制造中心则在该国的另一边。良好的想法经常在裂缝之间落后于PARC工作人员的挫败感。</p><p> Still, as the years passed, Parc’s ideas had a big impact on social science and Silicon Valley. Their work helped to spawn the development of the “user experience” (UX) movement, prodding companies such as Microsoft and Intel to create similar teams. Their ideas about “sense-making” spread into the consumer goods world, and from there to an unlikely sphere: Wall Street.</p><p> 仍然是随着年的过去，PARC的思想对社会科学和硅谷产生了很大影响。他们的作品有助于产生“用户体验”（UX）运动，诸如Microsoft和Intel等公司创建类似的团队的发展。他们对“感知”传播到消费品世界的想法，从那里到一个不太可能的球体：华尔街。 </p><p> A social scientist named Patricia Ensworth was one of the first to use sense-making in finance. Starting in the 80s, she decided to use social science to help explain why IT issues tended to generate such angst in finance. Her research quickly showed that the issues were social and cultural as much as technical. In one early project she found that American software coders were completely baffled as to why their internally developed software programmes kept malfunctioning – until she explained that office customs in other locations were different. In the early 90s, Ensworth joined Moody’s Investors Service, and eventually became director of quality assurance for its IT systems. It sounded like a technical job. However, her key role was pulling together different tribes – software coders, IT infrastructure technicians, analysts, salespeople and external customers. Then she formed a consultancy to advise on “project management, risk analysis, quality assurance and other business issues”, combining cultural awareness with engineering.</p><p>一个名叫Patricia Ensworth的社会科学家是第一个在金融中使用感应制作之一。从80年代开始，她决定使用社会科学来帮助解释为什么它往往会在金融中产生这种焦虑。她的研究很快表明，这些问题与技术一样社会和文化。在一个早期项目中，她发现美国软件编码器完全困扰，以为他们的内部开发的软件程序保持故障 - 直到她解释了其他地方的办公海关不同。在90年代初，Ensworth加入了穆迪的投资者服务，最终成为其IT系统的质量保证总监。它听起来像一份技术工作。但是，她的关键作用是拉动不同的部落 - 软件编码器，IT基础设施技术人员，分析师，销售人员和外部客户。然后，她组建了一个咨询，建议“项目管理，风险分析，质量保证和其他业务问题”，与工程结合起来。</p><p>  In 2005, Ensworth received an urgent message from a managing director at a major investment bank. “We need a consultant to help us get some projects back on track!” the manager said. Ensworth was used to such appeals: she had spent more than a decade using techniques pioneered by the likes of Orr and Seely Brown in order to study how finance and tech intersected with humans.</p><p>  2005年，Ensworth从一家主要投资银行获得了董事总经理的紧急信息。 “我们需要一位顾问来帮助我们回到轨道上的一些项目！”经理说。 Ensworth习惯了这样的吸引力：她花了超过十年的人使用由Orr和Seely Brown的喜欢的技巧，以研究如何与人类交叉的金融和技术。</p><p> The investment bank project was typical. Like many of its rivals, this bank had been racing to move its operations online. But by 2005 it was facing a crisis. Before 2000 it had outsourced much of its trading IT platform to India, since it was cheaper than hiring IT experts in the US. But while the Indian coders and testers were skilled at handling traditional investment products, they struggled to cope with a new derivatives business that the bank was building, since the Indian coders had formal, bureaucratic engineering methods. So the bank started to use other suppliers in Ukraine and Canada who had a more flexible style and were used to collaborating with creative mathematicians. But this made the problems even worse: deadlines were missed, defects emerged and expensive disputes erupted.</p><p> 投资银行项目是典型的。像许多竞争对手一样，这家银行一直在赛车上在线移动其运营。但到2005年，它面临着危机。 2000年之前，它将其大部分交易平台外包给印度，因为它比雇用美国专家更便宜。但是，虽然印度编码器和测试人员擅长处理传统的投资产品，但他们努力应对银行正在建设的新衍生品业务，因为印度编码人员具有正式，官僚工程方法。因此，银行开始在乌克兰和加拿大的其他供应商使用更灵活的风格，并被用来与创意数学家合作。但这使得问题甚至更糟糕：截止日期，出现了出现的缺陷，昂贵的争议爆发。</p><p> “In the New York office, tensions were running high between the onsite employees of rival outsourcing vendors,” Ensworth later wrote. “The pivot point occurred when a fight broke out: a male Canadian tester insulted a female Indian tester with X-rated profanity and she threw hot coffee in his face. Since this legally constituted a workplace assault, the female tester was immediately fired and deported. Debates about the fairness of the punishment divided the office … [and] at the same time auditors uncovered some serious operational and security violations in the outsourced IT infrastructures and processes.”</p><p> “在纽约办事处，竞争外包供应商的现场雇员之间的紧张局势越来越高，”恩斯沃思之后写道。 “当战斗爆发时，枢轴点发生了：一位男性加拿大的测试人员侮辱了一位女性印度测试师，X-ry亵渎，她脸上扔了热咖啡。由于这一法律构成了工作场所攻击，女性测试仪立即被解雇并驱逐出境。关于惩罚公平的辩论分为办公室...... [和]同时审计员在外包IT基础设施和流程中发现了一些严重的运作和安全违规行为。“</p><p> Many employees blamed the issues on inter-ethnic clashes. But Ensworth suspected another, more subtle problem. Almost all the coders at the bank, whether they were in India, Manhattan, Kyiv or Toronto, had been trained to think in one-directional sequences, driven by sequential logic, without much lateral vision. The binary nature of the software they developed also meant that they tended to have an “I’m-right-you’re-wrong” mentality. Although the coders could produce algorithms to solve specific  problems, they struggled to see the whole picture or collaborate to adapt as conditions changed. “The [coders] document their research in the form of use cases, flowcharts and system architecture designs,” Ensworth observed. “These documents work well enough for version 1.0, because the cyberspace model matches the user community’s lived experience. But over time, the model and the reality increasingly diverge.”</p><p> 许多员工归咎于民族间冲突的问题。但是为了荣誉嫌疑人，更细微的问题。几乎所有在银行的编码人员，无论是在印度，曼哈顿，基辅还是多伦多，都经过训练，以思考一方向序列，通过顺序逻辑驱动，没有太多的侧视。他们开发的软件的二进制本质也意味着他们倾向于有一个“我是正确的 - 你是错误的”心态。虽然编码器可以产生算法来解决特定问题，但他们努力看到整个画面或合作以适应条件改变。 “[编码器]以用例，流程图和系统架构设计的形式记录他们的研究，”Ensworth观察到。 “这些文件适用于1.0版，因为网络空间模型与用户社区的生活体验相匹配。但随着时间的推移，模​​型和现实越来越分歧。“</p><p> The coders often seemed unaware of the gap between their initial plan and subsequent reality. Ensworth persuaded the suppliers in India to provide training about American office rules and customs, and tried to teach the suppliers in Ukraine and Canada about the dangers of taking an excessively freewheeling approach to IT. She showed coders videos of the noisy and chaotic conditions on bank trading floors; that was a shock, since coders typically toiled in library-like silence and calm. She explained to managers at the bank that coders felt angry that they could not access important proprietary databases and tools. The goal was to teach all “sides” to copy the most basic precept of anthropology: seeing the world from another point of view.</p><p> 编码器似乎不知道其初始计划与后续现实之间的差距。以斯沃思说服了印度的供应商，为美国办公室规则和习俗提供培训，并试图教导乌克兰和加拿大的供应商关于采取过度常飞的方法的危险。她展示了在银行交易地板上的嘈杂和混沌条件的编码器视频;这是一个震惊，因为编码人员通常在图书馆沉默和平静中劳动。她向管理人员解释道，编码者感到愤怒，因为他们无法访问重要的专有数据库和工具。目标是教授所有“方面”，复制人类学最基本的戒律：从另一个角度看世界。</p><p> Ensworth did not harbour any illusions about changing the bank’s overall culture. When the financial crisis erupted in 2008, the project was wound down and she moved on. However, she was thrilled to see that du</p><p> Ensworth没有对改变银行整体文化的任何幻想。当金融危机于2008年爆发时，该项目被卷起来，她继续前进。然而，她很激动，看到杜 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jun/03/the-empty-office-what-we-lose-when-we-work-from-home">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jun/03/the-empty-office-what-we-lose-when-we-work-from-home</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/人类学家/">#人类学家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/business/">#business</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
