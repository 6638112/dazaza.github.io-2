Bloomberg  reports that Tesla is currently building a battery installation in Tesla CEO Elon Musk&#39;s new home state of Texas. The project is in Angleton, about an hour south of Houston.</p><p>特斯拉最知名为电动汽车公司，但该公司还拥有电池存储中的繁荣业务 - 包括公用事业尺度的电池装置，以支持电网。 Bloomberg报道，Tesla目前正在Tesla Ceo Elon Musk的电池安装＆＃39;德克萨斯州的新家庭状态。该项目位于赫勒顿，大约一小时休斯顿。</p><p> Tesla hasn&#39;t publicized the project, which is operating under the name of an obscure Tesla subsidiary called Gambit Energy Storage LLC. When a Bloomberg photographer visited, a worker discouraged picture-taking and said the project was &#34;secretive.&#34; The project appears to consist of 20 large banks of batteries that have been covered by white sheets.</p><p> Tesla Hasn＆＃39;宣传该项目，该项目正在以叫做Gambit Energy Storage LLC的一个晦涩的特斯拉子公司的名称运作。当彭博摄影师访问时，一名工人劝阻图片并表示该项目是＆＃34;秘密。＆＃34;该项目似乎由白张覆盖的20个大型电池组成。</p><p> A  document on the city of Angleton&#39;s website provides some details about the project. It&#39;s listed as being a project of Plus Power but includes a photo of a Tesla battery cabinet. Plus Power counts two former Tesla employees among its executives. Plus confirmed to Bloomberg that it had started the project, then sold it to an undisclosed party.</p><p> 关于Angleton城市的文件＆＃39; S网站提供有关该项目的一些细节。它＆＃39; s列为Plus电源的项目，但包括TeSLA电池柜的照片。加号在其高管中占用了两个前特斯拉员工。加上它已经开始了项目的彭博，然后将其卖给了一个未公开的派对。</p><p>  The installation will use lithium iron phosphate batteries that are expected to last 10 to 20 years. The document says that it will generate around $1 million in property tax revenue for the city of Angleton. The site will be unmanned but will be remotely monitored at all times, according to the document.</p><p>  安装将使用预期持续10至20年的锂磷酸锂电池。该文件表示，它将在安尔顿市的财产税收入中产生约100万美元。根据该文件，该网站将无人驾驶，但将始终远程监控。</p><p> Texas has its own electric grid overseen by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. &#34;Angleton forms an especially volatile &#39;node&#39; on the ERCOT energy grid and the greater system will benefit from the energy balancing properties that the battery can provide,&#34; the document says.</p><p> 德克萨斯州拥有自己的电网，由德克萨斯州的电力可靠性委员会监督。 ＆＃34; angleton形成尤其是挥发性＆＃39;节点＆＃39;在ERCOT能量网格中，更大的系统将受益于电池可以提供的能量平衡特性，＆＃34;该文件说。</p><p> The Texas grid got a lot of attention in February after unusually cold weather left much of the state without power for several days. In a  sarcastic tweet last month, Musk wrote that &#34;ERCOT is not earning that R.&#34;</p><p> 德克萨斯州网格在2月份在没有动力的情况下留下了很多州后，2月份的注意力很大。上个月在一个讽刺的推文中，麝香写了那个＆＃34; ercot没有收入r。＆＃34;</p><p>    And Musk has a lot of reason to be concerned about the quality of the electric grid in Texas. Not only did Musk recently relocate to the state, but both of his companies—SpaceX and Tesla—are expanding their footprint there. Tesla is  building a car factory in the Austin area. SpaceX has long had a testing facility in McGregor, Texas, about halfway between Austin and Dallas. More recently, SpaceX has been  pouring resources into its Boca Chica launch facility at the very southern tip of the state.</p><p>    而且麝香有很多理由担心德克萨斯州电网的质量。麝香最近不仅搬迁到国家，而且他的公司都是-Spacex和特斯拉 - 正在那里扩大他们的足迹。特斯拉正在奥斯汀地区建造汽车厂。 Spacex长期以来在德克萨斯州McGregor，德克萨斯州的一家测试设施，大约在奥斯汀和达拉斯之间。最近，SpaceX一直在倾向于在州南端的博卡奇卡发射机构中倾倒资源。 </p><p> An ERCOT official told Bloomberg that the secretive installation has a proposed commercial operation date of June 1, so it may be nearing completion.</p><p>埃尔科官员告诉布隆伯格，秘密安装有一个拟议的6月1日商业运营日期，因此它可能会接近完成。</p><p> Back in 2017, we covered Tesla&#39;s  construction of a massive battery installation in South Australia. At the time, the 100 MW system was the largest in the world. According to Bloomberg, the new Texas battery system will be at least as big.</p><p> 回到2017年，我们覆盖了南澳大利亚南澳大利亚巨大电池安装的建设。当时，100 MW系统是世界上最大的系统。根据彭博的说法，新的德克萨斯州电池系统将至少大。</p><p>  In the long run, massive battery facilities will be needed to shift intermittent solar and wind power in time. But a lot of battery installations today don&#39;t have enough capacity to do much of this. Tesla&#39;s South Australia battery, for example, only had enough capacity to supply power for a little over an hour at its full 100 MW power level.</p><p>  从长远来看，需要大量的电池设施，以便在时间移动间歇性太阳能和风力。但是今天很多电池装置Don＆＃39; T有足够的能力来做到这么大。例如，特斯拉＆＃39; S南澳大利亚电池只有足够的容量在其全额100 MW功率水平下供电。</p><p> Rather, early utility-scale batteries are being used to smooth out shorter-term fluctuations and keep supply of power perfectly balanced with demand. If a power plant unexpectedly fails or demand suddenly spikes, a utility-scale battery can provide a few minutes of power while electric utilities make necessary adjustments.</p><p> 相反，早期的公用电池被用来平滑短期波动，并随着需求完全平衡的电力。如果发电厂突然出现故障或需求突然飙升，则电池可以提供几分钟的电力，而电力实用程序做出必要的调整。</p><p> Utilities traditionally deal with this by having plants powered by natural gas on standby 24/7. Because these &#34;peaker plants&#34; might only be used for a few hours per year, the energy they produce is extremely expensive on a per-kilowatt basis. Batteries can soak up excess power at times when it&#39;s plentiful, then release it at times of peak demand, allowing electric utilities to retire some of their gas-fired peaker plants without compromising grid reliability.</p><p> 公用事业传统上通过在待机24/7上用天然气供电的植物来处理这一点。因为这些＆＃34;峰值植物＆＃34;只能使用每年几个小时，它们生产的能量在每千瓦的基础上非常昂贵。电池可以在＆＃39;在峰值需求中释放它时，电池可以浸泡多余的电力，然后在峰值需求中释放它，允许电力公用设施在不影响电网可靠性的情况下退出一些燃气峰值植物。</p><p> As batteries get cheaper, it will become economical to install even larger batteries to balance out supply and demand over a 24-hour cycle, enabling utilities to rely more heavily on solar and wind power. This is why analysts expect utility-scale batteries to be a massive growth market over the next decade or two; it&#39;s going to take a lot more storage capacity to de-carbonize the electric grid.</p><p> 随着电池更便宜，它将经济应用更大的电池，以在24小时周期中平衡供需，使公用设施更依赖于太阳能和风力。这就是为什么分析师预计未来十年或两个人在未来十年内成为大规模增长市场的原因;它＆＃39; s将采取更多的存储容量来碳化电网。</p><p>  Texas (and everywhere else) has been building lots of batteries lately. This is way too quick to break ground as a response to the recent power outage though; it would have been in planning for months, and probably is targeting to get connected before the summer to help with what was expected to be the hard time to keep the lights on: a heat wave.  Nit: HPR has a bit over an hour at its 150 MW level -- it got upgraded from the original 100 MW.</p><p>  德克萨斯州（和其他地方）最近一直在建造大量电池。尽管如此，这太快了，以作为对最近的停电的回应;它将在规划几个月，并且可能是在夏天之前联系，以帮助您预期的是难以保持灯光的困难：热浪。 NIT：HPR在150 MW水平上有一个小时 - 它从原版100 MW升级。 </p><p> Not to mention, a battery installation like this wouldn&#39;t have had much effect on the recent power outage - it was too big/long lasting. As mentioned in the second part of the article, battery installations are more about smoothing out the demand curve and getting rid of instantaneous spikes. This installation would have been drained dry in the first day.</p><p>更不用说，这样的电池安装就像这个那样会对最近的停电有很大的影响 - 它太大/持久。如图中的第二部分所述，电池装置更多地详细说明需求曲线并摆脱瞬时尖峰。这套安装在第一天将在干燥。</p><p>  I don&#39;t think this isn&#39;t entirely true. The Texas grid was quickly being overwhelmed and was minutes away from much more severe and long lasting damage. While a battery installation this size couldn&#39;t keep the power on long term, it likely could provide enough energy to buy ERCOT et al. a little more time to analyze and handle similar emergency situations. Even an additional 30 minutes could help avoid catastrophe.</p><p>  我不认为这不是真实的，觉得这个是＆＃39;德克萨斯州网格很快被淹没，距离更严重和持久的损害更加严重和持久的几分钟。虽然电池安装这个尺寸可以长期保持电源，但它可能会提供足够的能量来购买ercot等。更多的时间来分析和处理类似的紧急情况。即使还有30分钟也可以帮助避免灾难。</p><p>  Texas (and everywhere else) has been building lots of batteries lately.

Once ERCOT started dropping in frequency, it was only a matter of time before various suppliers kicked offline due to phasing issues and trying to keep their equipment from damaging itself as a result. If the plant is pedal to the metal, and it&#39;s still slowing down due to the drag on it from the grid, at some point it needs to kick offline before it essentially stalls out -- there things are made to run at 60Hz +/- a couple of Hz. Get outside of that regime while trying to supply a ton of power, and things get really weird and out-of-phase and scary. Best to retreat and live to fight (generate power) another day, versus being totaled and requiring lots of expensive repairs to get back online.  What batteries can do (and Tesla has done) is that since it&#39;s a synthetic waveform, they can easily and dynamically voltage-lead the waveform on the grid, essentially helping to push those generators back into their design spec and keep things in frequency. Because often the death spiral is too much load -&gt; frequency drops -&gt; generators go offline to save themselves -&gt; brown outs. With a battery you cut that off during the &#34;frequency drops&#34; phase, and provide the synthetic inertia to keep those plants connected to the grid. Hornsdale has made tremendous amounts of money providing this synthetic inertia (FCAS) to the grid, which has allowed it to stay in spec and stay online to wild success.  edit: In fact, there are some trials with some decently large batteries attached to NG/coal plants where they&#39;ll do the synthetic inertia thing themselves instead of ramping up/down in frequency at the turbine itself, which takes a lot of time and is somewhat costly.

The more you&#39;re out-of-phase, the more stress and waste you&#39;re putting on the grid, so keeping it tight is good. But that&#39;s for grid management. ERCOT got down to 59Hz or so. For plants, it&#39;s different. But most plants can reasonably supply electricity down to 58Hz before they&#39;re really starting to drop into the non-linear portions of their RPM/Torque power curve and limits for blade life/fatigue and equipment stresses, etc.  edit: As that reddit chain (live updates from a grid watcher/grid expert) shows, ERCOT *should* have needed to curtail about 8GW of load. They curtailed 22GW due to their mismanagement/bad plans around regulation. Lots of generation was shed due to the grid being under-frequency and out of spec. If they had had something like this (no idea of this battery is big enough or not) that could synthetically make the grid appear/be more in-spec, they probably could have curtailed generation more controlled and efficiently and gotten closer to curtailing the necessary 8GW versus the 22GW they shed. That&#39;s a lot of homes that could have had power that didn&#39;t due to their poor management, and not having things like good synthetic reserves on the grid in order to keep frequency from collapsing.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comment ... s/gnii3el/</p><p>  是的，网格试图以不到十分之一的Hz留在规格中。你越＆＃39;重新阶段，压力越多，浪费你＆＃39;重新放在网格上，所以保持紧张，是好的。但是，对于网格管理，＆＃39; ercot降到了59hz左右。对于植物，它不同。但大多数植物可以在它们＆＃39之前合理地向58Hz提供电力。重新开始进入其RPM /扭矩功率曲线的非线性部分和叶片寿命/疲劳和设备应力的限制等Reddit Chain（来自网格观察员/网格专家的实时更新）显示，ERCOT *应要求缩减8GW的负载。由于他们在监管周围管理不善/不良计划，他们缩减了22GW。由于栅格低于频率和规格而导致的很多生成。如果他们有这样的东西（不知道这款电池足够大）可以合成可以综合制作网格/更具规范，他们可能可能会更加控制和有效地缩减一代，并将更接近限制必要的措施8GW与他们棚的22GW。 ＆＃39;很多可能有能力，由于他们的管理差，而不是在网格上没有像良好的合成储量一样，以保持频率倒塌。 https://www.reddit.com/r/austin/comment ... s / gnii3el / </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/report-tesla-is-secretly-building-a-giant-100-mw-battery-in-texas/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/report-tesla-is-secretly-building-a-giant-100-mw-battery-in-texas/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/特斯拉/">#特斯拉</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/建造/">#建造</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/battery/">#battery</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电池/">#电池</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
