Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.</p><p>2010年，Photoshop普遍存在。无论您是编辑照片，都在编辑一张照片，还是设计网站，它发生在Photoshop中。</p><p> Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the  best companies at M&amp;A; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p><p> 今天，Adobe看起来非常强烈。由于对已经支付的大胆赌注进行了清洁的管理，他们已经有壮观的股票表现。他们到SaaS的过渡已经是无缝的，公共市场对他们来说令人享有奖励。他们在历史上看了M＆amp的最佳公司之一;他们的产品阵容是他们获得新产品系列的能力，并将其整合到它们的多产品生态系统中。也许最重要的是最不赞赏的，他们已经大大加快了其内部产品开发过程和反馈回路的节奏。与Microsoft一样，他们已成功从一家年度（或更长）发布计划运营的传统公司转移到一个真正的云公司以亚每周速度运输更新。</p><p> Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in  2019. They reprised in  2020, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p><p> 尽管如此，有几个设计的部分，他们不再是市场领导者。如图，素描和帆布等公司是能够成为顶级产品的产品，尽管Adobe在所有内容设计中都有顶级产品。 Figma在2019年首次出现了Adobe的年度报告。他们在2020年重复，我并不难以努力继续进入它。</p><p> How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p><p> 我们该如何理解这些市场过渡以及为什么这些年轻的公司能够茁壮成长，即使是像Adobe这样的强大现任？</p><p> These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p><p> 这些公司从Adobe有明显的原子概念。其产品建立的原始原因与Adobe的产品阵容根本不同。这是这些不同的基本原子概念，使Adobe成为一个已建立的产品和现有UserBase的优势成为阻碍了他们对抗这些初学者的能力的弱点。这些新的原子概念来茁壮成长的机会是由新用例和在市场转型期间出土的用户类型的推动。</p><p> Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p><p> 了解市场转型的阶段以及驱动器的阶段是一个值得审查的普遍过程。</p><p>  For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p><p>  对于大多数市场而言，有利于现任的优势。随着公司到达客户的偏好前沿，市场汇集了市场。这留下了很少的潜在能量，以利用新的初创公司。 </p><p>  It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p><p>通过蛮力闯入市场并不是不可能的，但它很难。很难。大多数成功的公司，尤其是初创公司，已经找到了尾部的线程，帮助他们前进。</p><p> Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p><p> 改变客户需求是市场中最大的熵源。当客户需要迅速变化时，现任者的优势较少。相反，遗留公司留下了所有的开销和产品，不再是客户想要的。</p><p> There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p><p> 改变客户需求的原因很多。通常有不同用例的客户有新的和越来越多的段。现有产品可能为他们工作，但它们并不是理想的。他们关心的功能以及它们如何将它们与客户习惯于客户的价值截然不同。公司抵抗其产品的核心部分，因为每一个新的用例都是工作，金钱和关注的昂贵。但是每次偶尔，一旦小用例都会成长为一个足够大的东西来支持自己的公司。</p><p> Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p><p> 其他时候，市场转移的规模或动态足以让产品不再有效，尽管有很好的契合。公司经常被这些情况平息，因为他们已经成功完成了多年的事情突然开始动摇 - 他们并不确定为什么。 eBay是一个很好的例子。当在网上销售的物品稀缺时，他们分散的拍卖模式在新兴的互联网经济中非常好。一旦电子商务变得普遍，价格和速度变得更加重要的因素，eBay的分散模式处于劣势。亚马逊在这次流动性生态系统中建立规模经济的建设经济。</p><p> Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p><p> 另一个来源是客户自己改变的时候。通常，工具的功能保持不变，但用户的类型更改。这些新型客户经常有不同的东西，他们关心并导致产品需求。</p><p> The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p><p> 互联网驱动了全新的设计用例。 Photoshop是为编辑照片和图像而构建的。它是一个在像素级别运行的强大工具。但是，这些新的许多用途都不是图像操作。图像是一个组成部分 - 不是工作用户的本质正在努力实现。</p><p> For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p><p> 对于某些用户来说，这是设计数字产品。软件公司或任何与网站的公司的设计人员想要创建他们工作的网站和软件产品。这对图像操纵较少，更多关于设计这些数字产品的UI和UX。矢量比光栅图形更重要。设计这些高价值设计的复杂性和过程也变得越来越复杂。这些设计师与其他设计师和非设计师的团队合作。他们的设计是更大的产品开发过程的一部分，而且不仅仅是制作设计的重要性，而且如何改进整个过程，以更好地提高协作和切换设计。迭代地。 </p><p> The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p><p>设计代码中的设计和组件的复杂性也变得更加复杂。他们的工具需要对组件和变体的更高级别了解变得更加重要。设计用于了解与生成的最终产品中的HTML和CSS相同的概念和抽象级别越来越有用。</p><p> For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p><p> 对于某些用户来说，这是为社交平台，数字广告甚至婚礼邀请设计内容。这些通常在Photoshop中进行，但同样，像素是错误的抽象级别。图像不是唯一的组件;它们只是一个更大的设计，包括图形，文本等。同样，客户非常不同。现在，许多人在做什么，实质上，设计工作并不认为自己是设计师。他们只有一个非常具体的东西，他们想要创造，可能是可能的最少的摩擦力。</p><p> The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their  stock price is a testament to this.</p><p> 互联网大大缩放了设计新用例的音量和类型。在许多方面，这有助于Adobe。使用Instagram等平台，编辑照片的人数已经扩大了许多数量级。在像Instagram这样的平台上编辑可能会增加显着增加，Adobe一直是互联网的巨大受益者，而云的转变 - 他们的股价是迄今为止的估约。</p><p> [KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</p><p> [kk注意：像Instagram将编辑器中的平台捆绑在他们的社交平台上，从底部进食到Lightroom非常值得自己的讨论。也许有人会说服迈克克里格，以做出明确的作品。]</p><p>  This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p><p>  视频中的甚至更真实。由于录制视频的能力变得普遍存在，并且视频是默认格式的平台，有更多的视频创建者作为录制视频的能力。更加醒目，许多主要的视频平台 - 就像Youtube  - 纯粹的分布集中。它们甚至没有任何编辑能力。相反，像Adobe这样的公司最终成为这种需要的大受益者。</p><p> [KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</p><p> [kk注意：像youtube这样的平台仍然没有建立任何一个编辑器进入他们的平台，是*非常值得自己的讨论。我会说我们永远不会知道可能是什么，但后来我看着Tiktok，一切都是对世界的。]</p><p> But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p><p> 但是Adobe没有抓住它。在许多新的紧急用例和客户类型中，Adobe已经失去了新的创业公司。 </p><p>  The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p><p>最好的产品地图，以如何考虑他们的工作流程。它们与客户的抽象级别相匹配：不太高，这是不可用的，但不太低，以至于很难轻易使用或以更复杂的方式扩展。</p><p>  These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word… compound.</p><p>  这些是整个产品构建的核心概念。它们不仅与客户如何考虑其工作流程，而且常常为客户结晶它们应该如何结晶。伟大的原子概念是磨练的，然后在更复杂的化合物中延伸，建立在......缺乏更好的单词......化合物。</p><p> Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p><p> 类似的公司通常具有略微不同的原子概念，最终使它们有意义地截然不同。 Photoshop专注于像素和图像。它的重点是编辑图像和图片。其功能通过将它们转换在像素级别上来运行。</p><p> Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p><p> Illustrator类似，但它在向量上运行，而不是像素。这是一个更高的级别抽象。两者都没有更好或更差，它们更适合不同的用例。 Photoshop更适合修改图像，而Illustrator是为无缝缺陷载体最佳的设计而设计的。</p><p> Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p><p> 素描，如插画家是基于矢量。但是专为建立数字产品而言，这意味着在项目级别运行的东西。它不是单独的设计，而是制定整个产品和用户界面 - 以及固有的重复性和一致性的需求。</p><p> Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p><p> Figma建立在素描的方法上，而且还包括更重要的是，不仅仅是项目，而是整个协作过程作为相关范围。同样，它还处理更高的抽象，如插件，社区，以及更重要的概念。</p><p> Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different templates and components to help them easily accomplish the job they are doing. And the designs they are working on are not quite at the project level of making a digital product. They are canvases that include images and design.</p><p> Canva类似于Photoshop和Illustrator，但其用户不是关心低级工具的设计师。相反，Canva的核心原子概念是在不同的模板和组件周围，以帮助他们轻松完成他们正在做的工作。他们正在努力的设计并不是在制作数字产品的项目水平。它们是包含图像和设计的画布。 </p><p>  Atomic concepts are fundamentally linked to the core loops of a company. Expanding or changing these loops often involves adding to a company’s vocabulary of atomic concepts or adding them together in more complex ways.</p><p>原子概念从根本上与公司的核心环联系起来。扩展或更改这些环路通常涉及到公司的原子概念的词汇，或者以更复杂的方式将它们添加在一起。</p><p> Emergent use cases and new customer types lead to new ideal atomic concepts. These new workflows and different customers have different priorities than existing customers. How they think about their problems and weight possible solutions is different, even if often the end output has similarities. Of course, astute readers will pick up that causality is reversed here. New types of customers are a good proxy for where to pay attention. But it is  actually the changed atomic concepts that are what make startups a compelling contender against incumbents in the space.</p><p> 紧急用例和新客户类型导致新的理想原子概念。这些新的工作流和不同客户的优先级不同于现有客户。它们如何考虑他们的问题和重量可能的解决方案是不同的，即使最终输出通常具有相似性。当然，精明的读者将在此撤销因果关系。新类型的客户是一个良好的代表，在哪里关注。但它实际上是改变的原子概念，这些概念是使初创企业对空间中的现任者的令人信服的竞争者。</p><p> Customers don’t care about your technical architecture or internal org structure. When these no longer align with the job they are trying to do, then all the sprawl of the company becomes harmful, not helpful. These are the core bedrock that are much more difficult for a company to change mid-flight. Everything that makes an established company strong is built on top of this foundation and will fight back against changing them. Take Blockbuster and its reliance on physical stores and late fees. People often fall into the easy narrative that incumbents are asleep at the wheel. That they are too stupid to see the coming threat. This can be true but it isn’t the most common reason. Contrary to popular belief, many execs at Blockbuster not only saw the threat Netflix posed, but also the opportunity for Blockbuster to have claimed the mantle Netflix now holds. They even spun up a team to take Netflix head on. But what made retail stores and late fees so powerful and profitable for Blockbuster is also what made them so hard to displace. Every move to prepare Blockbuster’s core for a digital future was resisted by execs who generated more revenue, store operators who were livid at being cut out, and Wall Street investors uncomfortable with turning a consistent business into a high risk venture.</p><p> 客户不关心您的技术架构或内部组织结构。当这些不再与他们想要做的工作保持一致时，那么公司的所有蔓延都变得有害，而且没有帮助。这些是核心基岩，对公司更加困难的难以改变中间飞行。使成熟公司强大的一切都建立在这个基础之上，并将反对改变它们。占据大批准及其对物理商店和延迟费用的依赖。人们经常陷入容易的叙述中，现任者在车轮上睡着了。他们太愚蠢，无法看到即将到来的威胁。这可能是真的，但这不是最常见的原因。与普遍的信念相反，磅塞的许多股票不仅看到了Netflix的威胁，而且遭到了大片的机会，以便现在举行地幔Netflix。他们甚至削弱了一个团队才能接受netflix头。但是，零售商店和延迟费用如此强大和盈利的延迟费用也是让他们如此难以取代的原因。为数字未来做准备的每一项搬家都是由产生更多收入，商店运营商在被削减的储存，而华尔街投资者对高风险企业转变为高风险企业的储存运营商。</p><p> Rare is the company that can change its core atomic concepts. It’s why companies like Amazon are so impressive and so daunting. Startups thrive by finding asymmetric angles on incumbents that they are unable to follow. What is safe from a company with no sacred cows?</p><p> 罕见的是可以改变其核心原子概念的公司。这就像亚马逊这样的公司是如此令人印象深刻的令人兴奋的原因。启动通过查找他们无法遵循的现任者的不对称角度而茁壮成长。什么是一个没有神圣奶牛的公司安全？</p><p> Understanding the core abstraction levels of a company is hard to understand from a distance. Which is why looking for emergent customer types with different needs is a useful substitute.</p><p> 了解公司的核心抽象级别很难从远处理解。这就是为什么寻找具有不同需求的紧急客户类型是一个有用的替代品。</p><p>  Sketch was the company to first understand the market opportunity in designing digital products. Launched in 2010, Sketch was built entirely for designing the UI and UX of these products. Its atomic concepts were those best for digital products: vectors and projects. These were also what made it hard for Adobe to compete with their pre-existing product line.</p><p>  素描是公司首先了解设计数字产品的市场机会。在2010年推出，素描完全建立了设计这些产品的UI和UX。其原子概念是最适合数码产品的概念：向量和项目。这些也是难以与其预先存在的产品线竞争的原因。</p><p> In a classic innovator’s dilemma, Sketch’s best feature against Adobe was that it dropped everything that wasn’t best for making digital products. This allowed it to focus only on creating the best experience for vector-based digital design. Unlike Photoshop, it was vector based. And unlike Illustrator it was built with larger complex projects as the focus rather than specific isolated designs.</p><p> 在经典的创新者的困境中，素描对抗Adobe的最佳特点是它丢弃了最不适合制作数字产品的一切。这允许它仅关注创造基于向量的数字设计的最佳体验。与Photoshop不同，它是基于矢量。与Illustrator不同，它建于较大的复杂项目，作为焦点而不是特定的孤立设计。 </p><p> In retrospect, Sketch stopped at a half measure. Designers creating digital products did need vector-based design tools. And Sketch also understood that they were working on more complex projects vs one off designs that needed better project-first features. But these designers were  also often working on teams—both with other designers and, more importantly, with non-designers. They weren’t designing in isolation, but as part of a larger process.</p><p>回想起来，草图在半尺寸下停止。设计人员创建数字产品确实需要基于向量的设计工具。和素描还可以理解，他们正在研究更复杂的项目与一个需要更好的项目的设计，更好的项目。但这些设计师也经常与其他设计师一起工作，更重要的是，与非设计师。他们没有孤立地设计，而是作为更大过程的一部分。</p><p> Sketch, like Adobe before it, lacked in this area. Everything from Sketch’s technical architecture and desktop based product to its pricing model and platform structure were a poor fit for this collaboration. The demand for these features could be seen in the messy ways that companies hacked together solutions to this and the many products that sprung up to fill these holes. Companies like Zeplin, Sympli, and Invision grew out of designers’ needs for better ways to coordinate with the other designers, PMs, and engineers they worked with. Sketch’s plugin system, like Adobe’s, felt more bolted on than core to the platform.</p><p> 在这个领域缺少它之前的素描，就像Adobe一样。从素描的技术架构和基于桌面的产品到其定价模型和平台结构的一切都是这种合作的不良契约。这些特征的需求可以以凌乱的方式看到，公司在一起的杂乱方式以及涌现的许多产品来填充这些孔。像Zeplin，Sympli和Invision这样的公司逃离了设计人员，以便更好地与他们合作的其他设计师，PM和工程师协调。素描的插件系统，如Adobe的系统，比核心更闪烁到平台上。</p><p> When Figma first started, it was more directly a Photoshop competitor. Over its first two years, though, they shifted their focus specifically to designers working on the UI and UX of digital products as they talked to more potential users. Building out the product to enable collaboration uniquely was key to these designers. Doing this was non-trivial. The technical challenges to do so were very hard, though Figma was well set up due to Evan Wallace’s technical prowess and specific knowledge in new technologies like WebGL. Building for collaboration to its fullest extent has led Figma to rethink almost all of the company—leading to new pricing models, distribution models, and sharing form factors.</p><p> 当Figma首次启动时，它更直接为Photoshop竞争对手。然而，在前两年的前两年，他们专注于在与更多潜在用户交谈的数字产品上的UI和UX的设计师。构建产品以使合作唯一的是这些设计人员的关键。这样做是非微不足道的。由于evan华莱士的技术实力和WebGL这样的新技术的特定知识，因此Figma是非常艰难的技术挑战非常艰难。建立合作以最大程度的合作使得重新思考几乎所有公司 - 导致新的定价模型，分销模式和共享形式因素。</p><p> For those interested in reading more on Figma, I have a prior post that can be found  here so will avoid rehashing many of the same observations. Figma’s success came as it honed in on this growing use case of complex digital products built by larger teams of designers and non-designers—and in finding the atomic concepts that were uniquely needed for this new skew of users.</p><p> 对于有兴趣阅读更多图形的人，我有一个可以在这里找到的先前帖子，所以避免重新恢复许多相同的观察结果。 Figma的成功来到了由更大的设计师和非设计师建造的复杂数码产品的不断增长的用例，以及寻找这种新用户偏差所需的原子概念。</p><p> As discussed in  Why Figma Wins, over the last few years this is most visible in their expansion into larger enterprise customers. Large companies have the same (if not greater) need for design tools that are built for the collaboration in their org as small startups or smaller teams within them. However, the set of features and tools they need around this look very different from a small team. When Figma started, it found its fit first with small teams, but as entire large companies started to look at it seriously it needed to understand how to think about collaboration and building a design tool not just at a team level—but at the scale of an entire company.</p><p> 正如为什么Fogma WINS所讨论的那样，在过去的几年中，这在扩展到较大的企业客户方面最可见。大公司具有相同的（如果不更大）需要为在其ORG中为其中的协作构建的设计工具，因为它们内部的小型启动或更小的团队。但是，他们需要的一组功能和工具，这看起来与小型团队非常不同。当Figma开始时，它首先与小型团队合适，但随着整个大公司开始认真地看待它，需要了解如何考虑合作和建立一个设计工具，而不仅仅是在团队级别 - 但在规模中整个公司。</p><p>  With the rise of digital platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube, marketing and advertising have increasingly shifted online. Online advertising has many differences from traditional advertising. Most notably, it is much faster paced—and often more targeted. Companies now do many small variations on the same campaign: testing which versions do best, making personalized versions for different customer cohorts, and adjusting them to the different required form factors of each ad platform. The traditional process of having a few large campaigns each year looks increasingly archaic. The cadence was a function of the primary channels being areas like TV and print, where campaigns are costly so only a few large campaigns can be run a year. As the channels shift, the campaigns, tools, and teams adjust to match the new dynamics.</p><p>  随着像Facebook，Instagram和YouTube这样的数字平台的兴起，营销和广告越来越多地转移。在线广告与传统广告有许多差异。最值得注意的是，它的节奏更快 - 并且往往更具目标。现在，公司在同一个广告系列中做了许多小变化：测试哪种版本最佳，为不同的客户队列制作个性化版本，并将其调整到每个广告平台的不同必需的形式因素。每年拥有一些大型活动的传统过程看起来越来越古老。节奏是主要渠道是电视和印刷品的主要渠道的函数，广告系列昂贵，所以只有几个大型广告系列可以运行一年。随着频道转移，广告系列，工具和团队调整以匹配新动态。</p><p>  Increasingly, marketing teams don’t need whole design teams working on each campaign. Rather, they want tools that made it easy for them to adjust their marketing designs in small ways—like being able to format it for both their instagram ad as well as their Youtube banner. The background of the person needed to do this changes, too. Instead of hiring design agencies, companies bring this work in house, both because more of the work can be done by non-designers and because the pace of iterations makes working with an external agency too slow.</p><p>  营销团队越来越需要在每个广告系列上工作的整个设计团队。相反，他们希望工具使他们能够轻松地以小型方式调整他们的营销设计，就像能够为他们的Instagram广告以及YouTube横幅格式化它。也需要执行此类变化的人的背景。公司在房子里携带这项工作，而不是招聘设计机构，这两者都是因为更多的工作可以由非设计者完成，因为迭代的步伐使外部机构更加慢。 </p><p>  Marketers and people posting on Instagram don’t think of the design work they want to do in terms of pixels. It’s the wrong abstraction level. They aren’t trying to directly edit the photos themselves. The photos are just an aspect of the specific goal they have in mind. They think of it in terms of the aesthetics and purpose of the design—not just the images but also the text and graphics and more.</p><p>在Instagram上发布的营销人员和人们不会想到他们想要在像素方面所做的设计工作。这是错误的抽象级别。他们并不试图直接编辑照片。照片只是他们记住的具体目标的一个方面。他们就设计的美学和目的而言，他们认为 - 不仅仅是图像，还包括文本和图形等。</p><p> Photoshop can do everything they want, but it is too low level. Photoshop’s atomic concepts are images and pixels. Editing at the pixel level is perfect for photos and image manipulation. Canva operates at a higher abstraction level—the one its users care about. Canva designs start with their purpose in mind, whether that’s designing a pitch deck, an Instagram post, or a wedding invitation. Canva has templates and layouts built for that specific purpose, while making it easy for users to add their own creativity, whether by putting in their own photos or using any of the many graphics and components made by the community.</p><p> Photoshop可以尽一切努力，但它太低了。 Photoshop的原子概念是图像和像素。在像素级别编辑是完美的照片和图像操作。 Canva在更高的抽象级别运行 - 其用户关心的一个。 Canva Designs的目的在于设计，无论是设计音高甲板，Instagram帖子还是婚礼邀请。 CANVA具有模板和布局，用于该特定目的，同时使用户可以轻松添加自己的创造力，无论是通过自己的照片还是使用社区所做的众多图形和组件中的任何一个。</p><p> This need is even more felt by SMBs and teams who can’t have a full design team work on every project.
