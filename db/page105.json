The truth is that documentation can make or break someone\u2019s success with your software. Often, developers form their first impressions through docs, even before they make it to the product. Bringing documentation to life with a personalized engaging experience can be the antidote to stale, esoteric docs. Build docs that act as the butler to your product.\n   Today, too many documentation sites are static, out-of-date, and lifeless. They aren\u2019t thought of with the same care and detail as the core product, even though they often are a core product. The reader is expected to do too much work, open tab after tab, search endlessly and scroll through verbose articles just to find a simple code example.\n Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the docs knew that you were writing a Python app on a Windows machine and that you preferred watching videos instead of reading through text? I want you to find the answer to your questions in the docs, easily and efficiently. When you\u2019re stuck on a problem and you turn to the docs, there\u2019s a moment of magic as you find the solution, try it out and it works. In that moment you become unblocked, you learn something new and you can move on to keep building your application.\n Over the past year, I\u2019ve spent time with our documentation team at GitHub where we have been working together to understand the challenges that developers face with documentation today. We want to build an experience that works better, inspires more, teaches instead of assumes, confuses less, and is personalized to your needs as a developer. Together, we learned a few key things that have helped misunderstand some of the pain developers face with documentation every day:\n People have a hard time finding what they need: Documentation is not linked from the right places in the product.\n Support teams rely on a knowledge management system (KM) that duplicates the docs instead of referencing them \u2014 focusing on content storage, retrieval, and assessment (instead of end-user success).\n Developers learn different things in lots of different ways \u2014 tutorials, videos, examples, guides, etc. Docs today mostly offer static content with code examples that aren\u2019t interactive.\n People use search as a way to navigate, and they often lose the search UX when they\u2019re deep into an article.\n When developers get stuck, they want to ask other developers questions &amp; get an answer from their peers.\n By the way, if we solve for these pain points, not only are we making the experience of reading and interacting with the docs better, but we\u2019re also able to improve the experience of writing the docs. If you\u2019re lucky to have an amazing group of technical writers, like we do at GitHub, it\u2019s important to take advantage of their deep knowledge of the product and give them the tools to write great docs. We open sourced the entire GitHub Docs application in October of 2020, this includes the content, the code, and even the process for authoring articles. With a system that\u2019s authored in a collaborative, immersive way, we have to build a user experience to match.\n  After talking with hundreds of developers, learning what they were struggling with, and what they wished for, I wrote up a few principles. The intent was to have something to lean on, that I could use as I brainstormed ideas that may solve some frustrations developers have with documentation.\n Lead with code: Developers want to write code, give them the code examples as starting blocks. Don\u2019t bury the lede.\n Solve the problem (aka: answer the question): Developers come to docs to learn the answer to a question, challenge, or problem they\u2019re trying to resolve. Give them the answer through multiple methods (video, text, tutorials, guides, etc.), so they learn the solution in a way that works for them.\n Enable community: Embrace the fun of collaboration, the support of the community, and empower people teaching people.\n Meet user&#39;s needs: Docs should never be optimized to result in a support ticket, we don\u2019t funnel devs to open tickets, we ensure our content meets the user\u2019s need.\n Encourage contribution: Open source \u2014 anyone should be able to contribute to docs &amp; help improve the content.\n Keep docs fresh: Software changes, so should the docs! They should feel alive, fresh, and relevant.\n Refine and simplify: Simplicity is hard to achieve, we consistently refine and simplify our platform and access to content \u2014 minimize the clicks to content.\n Measurable success: We are actively measuring if our content successfully meets users\u2019 needs and consistently improves its efficacy.\n Encourage play and experimentation: Developers come to docs to do many things, let them discover and engage creatively through playing around. \u201cTry it yourself!\u201d\n Medium agnostic &amp; portable: Developers should be able to call docs from wherever they are, like their terminal or their IDE. Code examples should be easy to take with you and re-use.\n  This next part is a little peek into the brain of a product person. What follows are a series of ideas \u2014 some of these are provoking actual improvements to GitHub\u2019s docs, but I use them as a way to spark curiosity and generate ideas for how we can build better docs for developers in general.\n My goal with these sketches was to set a direction for how we can take docs into a more community-driven, developer-first, extensible &amp; interactive, engaging world. The idea is that they\u2019re medium agnostic (devs can call docs from wherever they are), they\u2019re open source (anyone can contribute to the docs easily, which will mean updating our publishing process), and they\u2019re content as software (we treat the content like it\u2019s part of the software development process, not secondary to it).\n I wanted to move from a system that focuses on the brevity of our content platform to one that also highlights the intent behind what the developer is trying to do. When you look at other learning and content systems like Stripe, Twilio, or Circle CI, they structure the content around intent models. \u201cGet started with Stripe\u2019s API\u201d, for example, pinpoints the intent of the content upon entry, which puts the power into the hands of the developer as they explore and learn.\n These sketches are designed to help our users get to the right place faster, and force us as curators to think about what the reader is trying to do \u2014 we can structure based on intent, instead of brevity.\n Finally, they introduce a system that we can expand on as we explore and start building against it. So, there are a few things that I intentionally didn\u2019t focus on, but we\u2019ll need to address at some point because they\u2019re important:\n    I started with the article page for a tutorial or guide. I picked it first because developers often end up looking at these pages before they see any other part of the site and that\u2019s thanks to referral links and Google search.\n The idea behind this page is to get the reader into the content as quickly as possible so that they can experiment and try things themselves. The page is broken down into three parts: the left rail that walks through the tutorial steps, the right interaction box that highlights code examples, and the bottom which tells you where to go next and if you\u2019re feeling generous asks for feedback. The most important part of the page: the interaction.\n     Developers I talk with about documentation always tell me that they primarily learn from each other. Sometimes it\u2019s through code review, other times it\u2019s from googling and reading through other developer\u2019s examples. Taking this feedback to heart, I decided to play around with what it might look like to have a conversation about the software or code from within the documentation itself.\n      Docs are about learning and people learn in many ways. The idea that you learn in only one way has always seemed a little bananas to me. Sometimes I\u2019m an audible learner, sometimes I\u2019m visual. Embracing that, and the desire to make the docs come to life a little bit, I decided to add some video.\n This page works similarly to the article/tutorial page that uses code examples. If you\u2019d rather watch a video about the content, then click the video tab and press play. The video will show you a developer walking through the steps in the content on the left rail \u2014 and as you scroll, the video will advance to that part of the tutorial.\n   And because SSH is a bit of a white whale for documentation (it\u2019s the most visited article page for docs.github.com), I decided to explore a bit more about what would make the SSH article a little more friendly, but these layout options work for any tutorial. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\n    Search and navigation are often one in the same for content sites, but the UX is driven by intent.\n Let\u2019s start with navigation. To make sense of the breadth of content on the GitHub documentation page, we organize things into categories. However, category bloat happens when there are too many choices for a user to think about. This is the \u2018soup aisle conundrum,\u2019 which can of soup do you choose when you have over 100 options? The choice becomes so overwhelming that the customer eventually gives up. To combat category bloat, we curate what we serve to the user (we can lean on the search features to allow readers to navigate with more precision). When we curate aggressively we increase the precision and accuracy of our content. This helps get our users to the right place faster, and forces us as curators to think about what the reader is trying to do \u2014 we can structure these categories based on intent, instead of content brevity.\n Because navigation is a cornerstone for the site, I wrote down some rules for this sketch:\n    Navigation hierarchy works in cooperation with content hierarchy. Products are top-level, categories are curated based on intent, topics organize articles within a category and articles teach concepts in a topic. What you see above is an example of how the navigation fluctuates as you dive into a product area. Since there\u2019s more than one product, we need a view for that, too.\n  As you\u2019re exploring the site, use the navigation (this mega menu) to keep you oriented and find new things. What I\u2019ve learned from watching developers use docs.github.com, and from the usage data, is that people typically stay within one product area \u2014 they don\u2019t often explore across products during the same session. But if you wanted to, we need to make that kind of behavior easy, because the docs navigation is part of the way people discover new GitHub products!\n Now onto search. Search is a way to navigate with more precision (as opposed to browsing). You have an idea for what you\u2019re looking for, and you want to search for the answer. For example, if you\u2019re like me you constantly forget how GitHub SSH works, so whenever you need to use it you search for the SSH article. Search is also a cornerstone to the entire site experience, so it should be front and center.\n    The entire motivation for exploring these sketches is to build a doc experience that meets developers where they\u2019re at. Docs.github.com can do a better job of organizing the content, giving you new ways to access it, and customizing a reading experience that is designed for you. Developer documentation is part of the product, an extension of the application, and a part of the code. Without it, people can get lost, so it\u2019s important to give waypoints and that\u2019s what this system is intended to provide. The more magic \u201caha!\u201d and \u201cit worked!\u201d moments that we can inspire through documentation, the more we\u2019re unlocking a path for people to be creative, productive, and get back to the business of coding.\n If you think that documentation sites don\u2019t need to be prioritized or that we shouldn\u2019t invest in them, just ask a developer what they need, and then go think again about what you might be missing out on if you don\u2019t have an immersive, interactive and engaging experience for docs. Instead of just making Yet Another Docs Site (YADS), let\u2019s make experiences that stands apart \u2014 our developers deserve it.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 04:22:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u60f3\u5230,\u6587\u6863", "title": "\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\u6587\u4ef6 ", "title_en": "Maybe it\u2019s time we re-think docs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://kathykorevec.medium.com/building-a-better-place-for-docs-197f92765409", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u60f3\u5230", "\u6587\u6863"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8e0538daae4cea7a15c114ed73dc31a3.jpg", "infoid": 1067543, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Cat Contillo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a84\u50b2\u7684\u5947\u8ff9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u548c\u4ea8\u7279\u585e\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u3002\u5979\u5bf9LGBTQ +\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u5927\u5b66\uff0cDEI\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u3002\n  \u795e\u7ecf\u5927\u5b66\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c2\u770b\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6982\u5ff5 -

She&#39;s passionate about LGBTQ+ rights, autism, neurodiversity, DEI and cybersecurity.\n  Neurodiversity can mean different things to different people. It\u2019s a concept that views the spectrum of neurological differences \u2014 like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette\u2019s and other cognitive and developmental disorders \u2014 as natural variations of the human brain. In a nutshell, neurodiversity recognizes that brain differences are just that: differences.\n I was always aware of the fact that I had a different operating system. It was like growing up on a Mac OS, but made specifically for Windows OS. It wasn\u2019t until I was diagnosed as autistic that I understood why I am the way that I am. My diagnosis gave me a purpose. It\u2019s a purpose I\u2019ve taken with me into the working world, and it\u2019s helped me realize how vital neurodiverse individuals can and will be to the cybersecurity industry.\n   There are many inherent traits in people with autism that are well suited for working in cybersecurity. For example, many people with autism are pattern thinkers and are highly detail-oriented. This allows someone in a threat-hunting position to find those subtle differences between malicious and nonmalicious code and catch the threats that automated tools might miss. We also have the ability to hyperfocus, which allows us to concentrate on problem-solving and stick with complex issues that other people may abandon.\n Of course, we all have a different set of skills, interests, strengths and weaknesses. But there are some characteristics that \u2014 when given the right support and environment \u2014 can translate to cybersecurity positively.\n This is especially true when autistic adults are interested in technology and cybersecurity. Their interest can complement their attention to detail, which can make for a successful blue team cyber professional. The number and types of cyber threats are constantly changing. Some are obvious to hunt down, and some are much more subtle. Some malware even has the ability to \u201clive off the land\u201d by using already created applications or executables that live natively on a computer. Knowing this information, and knowing what to look for and where to hone in, allows a neurodivergent person to consistently inspect, investigate and hunt down even the most persistent threats.\n  Instead of focusing on what makes a neurodivergent person \u201cdifferent,\u201d we should embrace the benefits that different minds and viewpoints bring to the field of cybersecurity. Let\u2019s face it: The world is going to need more cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring diversity in these teams includes embracing neurodiversity. Having a blend of unique talents provided by these detail-oriented, rule-bound, logical and independent-thinking individuals is \u2014 and will be \u2014 a competitive edge in cybersecurity.\n Having a career in cybersecurity typically requires logic, discipline, curiosity and the ability to solve problems and find patterns. This is an industry that offers a wide spectrum of positions and career paths for people who are neurodivergent, particularly for roles in threat analysis, threat intelligence and threat hunting.\n Neurodiverse minds are usually great at finding the needle in the haystack, the small red flags and minute details that are critical for hunting down and analyzing potential threats. Other strengths include pattern recognition, thinking outside the box, attention to detail, a keen sense of focus, methodical thinking and integrity.\n The more diverse your teams are, the more productive, creative and successful they will be. And not only can neurodiverse talent help strengthen cybersecurity, employing different minds and perspectives can also solve communication problems and create a positive impact for both your team and your company.\n According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for Information Security Analysts \u2014 one of the common career paths for cybersecurity professionals \u2014 is expected to grow 31% by 2029, much higher than the average growth rate of 4% for other occupations. While vital jobs in cybersecurity are going unfilled, millions of smart people who\u2019d be ideally suited for the work remain unemployed.\n  It\u2019s time to challenge the assumption that qualified talent equals neurotypicality. There are many steps companies can take to ensure inclusivity and promote belonging in the workplace. Let\u2019s start all the way at the beginning and focus on job postings.\n Job postings should be black and white in terms of the information they are asking for and the job requirements. Start by making job postings more inclusive and less constrictive in what is being required. Include a contact email address where an applicant can ask for accommodations, and provide a less traditional approach by providing these accommodations.\n Traditional interviews can be a challenge for neurodivergent individuals, and this is often the first hurdle to employment. For example, to ease some candidates\u2019 nerves, you could provide a list of questions that will be asked as a guideline. More importantly, don\u2019t judge someone based on their lack of eye contact.\n To promote an inclusive and belonging culture of neurodiversity in the workplace, the workplace should be more supportive of different needs. It is vital to ensure employees at all levels have the knowledge and understanding on how to empower a diverse team and create an open and inclusive workplace. This starts with diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging training for all employees. Companies should also consider changing their communication style. Neurodiverse individuals communicate differently and not altering the way you communicate could lead to a disconnect in the workplace.\n My advice to other neurodivergent and/or autistic adults looking to break into the cybersecurity field is to continue your learning, connect with cybersecurity professionals for networking purposes and never give up.

What are you going to actually do to prevent those crashes, to save those lives?\u201d Mark Rosekind, the company\u2019s chief safety innovation officer and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.\n   Zoox is a bit different from its rivals. It isn\u2019t just developing the self-driving software stack. The company is responsible for creating the on-demand ride-sharing app and the vehicle itself. Zoox also plans to own, manage and operate its robotaxi fleet.\n Zoox unveiled in December the  electric, autonomous robotaxi it built from the ground up \u2014 a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. At the time, Zoox shared a few specs on the four-seat vehicle, including the face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter, and the 133 kilowatt-hour battery that the company said allows it to operate for up to 16 continuous hours on a single charge. But not everything was revealed, particularly details about how it would protect occupants in the vehicle as well as the pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers it will be sharing the road with.\n To be clear, Zoox is not the only AV company issuing safety reports. Voluntary safety self-assessment reports, or VSSAs, have become fairly common in the industry. These voluntary safety reports, which are included in  NHTSA\u2019s Automated Driving Systems VSSA Disclosure Index, are supposed to cover 12 areas, including the vehicle\u2019s design, crash simulation scenarios, benchmarks for testing as well as protective measures for occupants and other road users.\n Zoox\u2019s  first safety report came out in 2018, which outlined the company\u2019s \u201cprevent and protect\u201d philosophy. This latest one reveals how Zoox plans to meet its safety goals, including specific details on the design of the vehicle. And more safety reports are coming \u2014 per a few hints in this latest one \u2014 including details about its collision avoidance system and the lighting system the vehicle uses for communicating with other road users.\n Zoox has designed and built more than 100 safety innovations into its purposeful vehicle. Rosekind shared details on nine of them that fall into three categories: driving control, no single point of failure and rider protection.\n   Zoox\u2019s purpose-built vehicle has independent braking and inactive suspension system, which means that each of the brakes has its own electronic control unit, allowing for more control over traction on the road, weight distribution and an active suspension. All of that translates to shorter stopping distances.\n The vehicle also has four-wheel steering, which Rosekind noted doesn\u2019t exist on any car on the road today, and is bidirectional. Four wheel steering allows the vehicle to simultaneously adjust where it is headed and its position within the lane.\n \u201cOnce our software has determined the path for the vehicle, it\u2019ll stay on that path down to centimeters accuracy \u2014 even at speed through a curb, Rosekind explained.\n The four-wheel steering combined with the vehicle\u2019s  symmetrical design allows for it to travel bidirectionally. The bidirectional capability means no more U-turns or three-point turns, two maneuvers  that are more complex, time consuming and can make occupants more vulnerable to oncoming traffic.\n Rosekind said the company\u2019s design objective was that there would be no single point of failure for its safety critical systems. For instance, the vehicle has two powertrains. The motors, drive systems and batteries work in conjunction with each other. If one component in the system fails, the other one will take over.\n The vehicle also has two batteries as well as a safety diagnostics system that monitors all of the hardware, software and firmware. Sensors like lidar and. radar are also placed on the four corners of the vehicle, each one which provides a 270-degree field of view.\n The diagnostic system goes beyond monitoring and will  mitigate a failure or performance problem that it identifies. For instance, if a sensor has degraded performance from damage or debris, it will activate a cleaning system on the vehicle or turn it from\u00a0 bidirectional to unidirectional, so the sensor in a position where basically doesn\u2019t matter if it is obscured, Rosekind explained.\n \u201cFailsafe operational means it\u2019s going to continue the ride, let you out, and then go take care of whatever the issue is, or pull over to a safe spot,\u201d he said.\n   Zoox\u2019s goal is for its vehicle to meet a five-star crash protection for every seat in the vehicle. The vehicles are currently going through crash testing now, Rosekind said, adding that it is \u201cgoing quite well and almost complete.\u201d\n The company also designed a new kind of airbag system that contains five different airbags. Curtain airbags are on each side of the vehicle, a frontal one is divided in two parts to protect the head, neck and chest. There are also rear and side seat airbags.\n Within the system is an\u00a0airbag control unit that can monitor where a collision is coming as well as the velocity and determine which airbags and in what order to deploy. Instead of every airbag deploying at once, they will inflate based on the collision location and the severity of the impact.\n Finally, the vehicle has sensors in the seat, the buckle and even the coating on the webbing of the seatbelt to be able to tell if passengers are using the seatbelt. The vehicle will not start until everybody\u2019s buckled up, Rosekind said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 03:45:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bbe\u8ba1,amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,zoox,owned", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u62e5\u6709\u7684Zoox\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow Amazon-owned Zoox designed its self-driving vehicles to prevent crashes and protect if they do\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/how-amazon-owned-zoox-designed-its-self-driving-vehicles-to-prevent-crashes-and-protect-if-they-do/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bbe\u8ba1", "amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "zoox", "owned"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3a4f1314a5220a4b4a8dd0b4ce68ee2b.jpg", "infoid": 1067541, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Twitter\u6b63\u5728\u6253\u5f00\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5bf9\u5176\u8d85\u7ea7\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Twitter\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f;\u8d85\u7ea7\u9075\u5faa\u9650\u5236\u4e3aiOS\uff0c\u800ciOS\u548cAndroid\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\n Twitter\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5c0f\u7ec4\u201d\u7528\u6237\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u65b0\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5ba3\u5e03\u3002 Super\u4ee5\u4e0b\u529f\u80fd\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u6536\u53d62.99\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c4.99\u7f8e\u5143\u6216\u6bcf\u67089.99\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95ee\u72ec\u5bb6\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u552e\u7968\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6536\u53d61\u7f8e\u5143\u81f3999\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95eeTwitter\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u97f3\u9891\u5ba4\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u8bbe\u7f6e\u623f\u95f4\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u76d6\u5b50\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fa7\u680f\u4e2d\u67e5\u770b\u65b0\u7684\u201cMometization\u201d\u9009\u9879\u6765\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n   \u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u56e2\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6700\u521d\u5c06\u4fdd\u755997\uff05\u7684\u94b1\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7528\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u8d85\u7ea7\u6362\u53d6\uff0c\u5728IOS\u548cAndroid\u6536\u53d6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u5185\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u8d39\u7528\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u603b\u517150,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5219Twitter\u5c06\u4ece3\uff05\u589e\u52a0\u523020\uff05\u3002\n \u65e9\u671f\uff0c\u81ea\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u9884\u89c8\u4e86\u552e\u7968\u5e2d\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u6177\u6168\u7684\u6536\u5165\u62c6\u5206\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ecf\u7406Esther Crawford\u63a8\u65ad\u4e86\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u786e\u4fdd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u80fd\u591f\u8d5a\u94b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 ...\u4ece\u8d85\u7ea7\u8d5b\u540e\u83b7\u5f97$ 50k +\u7968\u636e\u548c\u552e\u7968\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u793a\u60a8\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u201c\n  Twitter\u768420\uff05\u7684\u4f63\u91d1\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u8ba2\u9605\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u670d\u52a1\u62bd\u6410\u4ece\u8ba2\u9605\u4e2d\u524a\u51cf\u4e8650\uff05\uff0c\u800cYouTube\u5219\u6536\u53d630\uff05\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u8d39\u3002\u8d39\u7528\u4e5f\u4e0e\u552f\u4e00\u768420\uff05\u76f8\u79f0\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5927\u5e45\u9ad8\u4e8e10\uff05\u7684\u901a\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6216\u8005\u4f1a\u5458\u5e73\u53f0Patreon\u76845\uff05\u57fa\u672c\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u670d\u52a1\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u5904\u7406\u8d39\u3002\u867d\u7136Facebook\u57282018\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba2\u9605\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u91c7\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u4f63\u91d1\uff08\u9664\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u5916\uff09\u76f4\u52302023\u5e74\u3002 ", "note_en": "Twitter is opening applications for a limited test of its Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces features. US-based users can apply separately for each program through Twitter\u2019s mobile app; Super Follows are restricted to iOS, while Ticketed Spaces are available on iOS and Android.\n Twitter will select a \u201csmall group\u201d of users to test its new monetization features, both of which were announced earlier this year. The  Super Follows feature lets users charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month for access to exclusive content.  Ticketed Spaces lets them charge between $1 and $999 for access to one of  Twitter\u2019s social audio rooms, and it offers extra features like setting a room size cap. Users can see if they\u2019re eligible to apply by checking a new \u201cMonetization\u201d option in the mobile app sidebar.\n   Test group participants will initially keep 97 percent of the money they make with Ticketed Spaces or Super Follows, after the fee that iOS and Android charge for in-app purchases. Twitter will increase its cut from 3 percent to 20 percent if a user makes a total of $50,000 on both systems.\n That early, far more generous revenue split has been added  since a preview of Ticketed Spaces last month. Today, senior product manager Esther Crawford tweeted that \u201cwe want to ensure that emerging voices are able to earn money, which is why they\u2019ll be eligible to earn a larger share starting out. ...

But it\u2019s substantially higher than the 10 percent commission from newsletter platform Substack or the 5 percent base rate of membership platform Patreon, although both those services require additional payment processing fees.

Following that topic, I&#39;d like to put down some thoughts about how browsers decode images - and how they do it differently, which can make things a bit tricky for you if you want to deliver the same user experience for every user of your application.\n So what does this mean exactly? Well, let&#39;s say that you have a single  img tag on your web page, but you update the  src attribute of it via JavaScript, and you do this often enough to trigger  this bug in Firefox. You can easily trigger it if you hook a scroll event to switching the  src attribute so that on each scroll the image source updates, which should work just fine on Chrome, but on Firefox will start blinking.\n Why does it start blinking? Well, it has everything to do with image decoding. The reason that it blinks on Firefox is that the image hasn&#39;t yet decoded when your scroll event is being triggered, but you are already attempting to display it - hence the blink.  There&#39;s a pretty easy solution for this that I also wrote about on the bug report but the gist of the matter is that the   HTMLImageElement  has a Promise called   decode and that you should not replace the  src attribute until the decode finishes, which you can do like this:\n const imgUrl = &#39;yournewimage.png&#39;; // your new imageconst img = new Image(); // create temporary imageimg.src = imgUrl; // add your new image as src on the temporary imageimg.decode().then(() =&gt; { // wait until temporary image is decoded document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl; // replace your actual element now});\n You see because in Firefox once the decode happens, even if it happens on an image element other than the one you are updating, the decoded result of that image is cached, and with it, the bug resolved.\n  Technically yes,  the MDN recommends that to know when it is safe to add the image to DOM, but what happens in Chrome with this code? Well, turns out it slows to a crawl and you&#39;re better off not using it. Now I don&#39;t think Chrome has implemented this feature in any other way from Firefox, except that for some unbeknownst reason it is a lot slower, but I do think that the two browsers decode images in a different way.\n While in Firefox you will see an artifact in the form of a blink when the decode is taking place, I think in Chrome you&#39;ll just not see an updated image until that image has decoded, thus you don&#39;t see a blink and everything  feels smoother, even if it is probably just the same. I tried to find more information on the differences but was unsuccessful, so if you do know something please get in touch. For now, without knowing more, my best recommendation is to in such a case simply write one implementation targeting Firefox and the other Chrome, like this:\n const firefox = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(&#39;firefox&#39;) &gt; -1;const imgUrl = &#39;yournewimage.png&#39;;const img = new Image();img.src = imgUrl;if (firefox) { img.decode().then(() =&gt; { document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl; });} else { document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl;}\n In Firefox we wait for the  decode Promise to tell us when we can safely update the image  src attribute, according to MDN spec. Otherwise, we&#39;ll just update the  src regardless of waiting for the decode to happen or not.\n And that&#39;s how I unified the experience across Firefox and Chrome with this particular issue. It&#39;s actually funny because just recently I remember thinking that browsers had come such a long way in the past 10 years that if you write something in one it always works in the others.

I ran them all with  docker-compose from a  Debian VPS.\n For the last couple months, however, I\u2019ve been meaning to move awayfrom Debian and towards something more minimal and clean. Over thislast weekend, I decided to move to  Alpine Linux.\n     In a previous move between two servers, I simply  rsynced therelevant files over to the new VPS. Here, where I\u2019m just switchingoperating systems on a single server, I figured I could make a backupwith Tarsnap, and be done within the day.\n However, backups are much more complex than simply transferring filesfrom one server to another. My haphazard strategy resulted in threedays of stress and frustration as I clambered to restore aself-hosting empire that I myself had reduced to ash.\n  I began my work on the transition full of optimism, if a bit stressed.I had read through the Tarsnap online documentation a number of times,and was ready to make my first attempt. I loaded my Tarsnap account upwith USD$10 and ran:\n  My terminal sat empty for hours. There were no changes \u2013 the processwas running, but there was no feedback. I was nervous.\n   To my horror, stats printed to the screen: the backup had been 90%complete, and I had stopped it. Convinced I had ruined the backupcompletely, I deleted the partial backup from Tarsnap and startedagain from scratch.\n This was my first, but not last, moment close to tears. I went tosleep and let the backup run overnight.\n  Day Two began well: I woke and the backup was finished! I wiped theVPS, installed Alpine, and brought it up to spec. I created a regularuser, configured SSH, and decided to use  doas instead of  sudo fora change. Alpine, so far, feels great to use. None of the cruft thatbothered me when using Debian.\n     I opened up a new  tmux window and poked around the filesystem. Allmy files seemed like they were already there\u2026\n    It errored out. All my environment variables were undefined. Then ithit me: I forgot to back up the  .env file. My eyes welled up.\n Still, I was determined. I worked to reconstruct the  .env file fromsecrets I had stored in  Bitwarden (my offline copy, because my vaultis self-hosted and was thus down).\n   One of my services was missing a Dockerfile to build. I shouldn\u2019t havepressed  &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;! I was a total moron.\n  I gathered what was left of my resolve and trudged onwards. I searched tarsnap\u2019s manpages looking for something to speed up my download.\n I found a number of flags that could have helped me  make a backupbetter the next time around, but nothing that would help me restorethe backup any faster. With nothing in the manpages, I went to look atthe  helper scripts.\n  That\u2019s when I found it:  redsnapper. A Ruby script that runs multipletarsnap clients at once to extract archives  fast. Fuckingprecisely. I wiped out the incomplete files I had restored, downloadedRuby and started restoring from the backup once again:\n  I changed  the song, and watched the files fly by on my screen. Iwent to sleep, confident I would wake to good news.\n    I restarted  redsnapper, explicitly excluding the  .mkv it hadfailed to download, and let it run until it came on another movie andcrashed again (an hour or so later). I excluded the second movie fileand sent it to run again.\n   Then I realized something.  redsnapper kept crashing when it hitmovies I had stored in  Jellyfin.\n I don\u2019t need Jellyfin at all. I\u2019ve never watched a movie more thanonce.\n The movies take up massive storage on disk, and keep causing tarsnapto crash. They don\u2019t compress well either, so they take up a fucktonof space in the archives.\n I stopped the download in the middle - the day\u2019s third, after twoearlier attempts that ended after encountering movie files \u2013 andchanged the command slightly before rerunning. After a number oferrors I couldn\u2019t explain, I realized my account was negative andtopped it up with another USD$25 before running:\n  I returned to my computer a couple hours later.  redsnapper hadstopped, with a whole lot of files extracted and a couple errors atthe bottom about symlinks.\n I figured, this time, it had probably done everything properly butcouldn\u2019t create the symlinks (probably a flag missing somewhere). Imanually went through my files creating the symlinks, and then broughteverything up with docker-compose.\n      After shutting down my containers, I backed up my entire setup.This included a number of  \u201clive\u201d databases,  .git folders,and other data that I either did not need or could reconstructonce the move had been completed.\n I didn\u2019t back up the  .env file I use to store secrets for use in docker-compose.yml. I was luckily able to reconstruct it fromindividual secrets I stored in my password manager.\n A thorough read of the manpages before I started (rather than justthe online guides) would have revealed several helpful flags: -v to see what files  tarsnap is operating on, --aggressive-networking to take advantage of the datacenterinternet speeds, and  --recover to resume interrupted backups, toname a few.\n We already talked about Jellyfin. Even with very little content inJellyfin, the collection took up huge amounts of space on disk andin the backup (especially because video files don\u2019t compresswell), and sat entirely unused. It is now gone. Good riddance.\n  What did I learn? Well, I\u2019m still devising a plan to prevent thingslike this from happening in the future. Here\u2019s the plan currently:\n  Back up everything every day. I\u2019ll build a buffer of three \u201crolling\u201dbackups, where backups collect up to a max of three and then, as newbackups are created, the older backups are removed.\n The backup script will shut down the services, dump the databases(i.e. convert as much content to plain-text, easily-compressibleformats as possible) and make a time-stamped backup (currently onlywith Tarsnap, but perhaps in the future with a number of otherservices).\n  Simply having high-quality backups to restore will already be a hugeleap forward. I\u2019m also  definitely going to continue using redsnapper: the speed gains it gives on large backups are crucial.\n    I\u2019ll write further about my self-hosting setup as it evolves, andpublish the backup script once its finished.

Repin recorded the years of work along the lower edge of the canvas.  Alexander III bought the painting for 35,000  rubles, at the time the greatest sum ever paid for a Russian painting. Since then, the canvas has been exhibited in the  State Russian Museum in  Saint Petersburg.\n   Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of  Cossacks sending an insulting reply to an ultimatum from the  Sultan of the  Ottoman Empire,  Mehmed IV.\n According to the (unsubstantiated) story, the  Zaporozhian Cossacks (from &#34;beyond the rapids&#34;, Ukrainian:  za porohamy), inhabiting the lands around the lower  Dnieper River in  Ukraine) had defeated  Ottoman Empire forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by  Ivan Sirko, replied in a characteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks&#39; pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities.\n  Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks:As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians \u2013 I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.\n   O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil&#39;s kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons. We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee. Fuck thy mother.\n Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia,  Podolian thief,  catamite of Tartary, hangman of  Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig&#39;s snout, mare&#39;s arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow. Screw thine own mother!\n So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won&#39;t even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we&#39;ll conclude, for we don&#39;t know the date and don&#39;t own a calendar; the moon&#39;s in the sky, the year with the Lord. The day&#39;s the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!\n  In the 19th century, the historical Zaporozhian Cossacks were sometimes the subject of picturesque tales demonstrating admiration of their primitive vitality and contemptuous disregard for authority (in marked contrast to the more civilized subjects of the authoritarian Russian state).  [2] Whether the incident portrayed actually happened or is a just another of these tales is not known, but no concrete or reliable evidence exists that it did happen,  [2] although the question remains disputed.\n Nikolai Gogol&#39;s 1842  romantic- historical novella   Taras Bulba describes the incident in passing. Repin associated with  Savva Mamontov and his artistic circle and probably heard the story there; at any rate, Repin made his first sketches for the painting in Mamontov&#39;s home.  [2]\n While working on the original version,  Repin in 1889 began work on a second version. This work remained unfinished. The artist tried to make the second version of  The Cossacks more &#34;historically authentic&#34;. In 1932 it was transferred by the  Tretyakov Gallery to the  M. F. Sumtsov Kharkiv Historical Museum. In 1935, it was moved to the  Kharkiv Art Museum \u00a0[ ru;  fr;  de], where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version.\n The historian  Dmytro Yavornytsky assisted Repin in portraying the scene authentically.   Vladimir Gilyarovsky, a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was said to be one of the models who posed for Repin. This, however, turned out to be a falsehood.  [4]\n   The French poet  Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a versified version of the letter (&#34;R\u00e9ponse des Cosaques Zaporogues au Sultan de Constantinople&#34;) as part of his poem &#34;La Chanson du mal-aim\u00e9&#34; in his collection of poems   Alcools (1913).\n This versified version of the letter has been set to music by the French singer-songwriter  L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, who composed a whole  oratorio on   La Chanson du mal-aim\u00e9 for soloists, choir and orchestra (1953). Verses were also set to music by  Dmitri Shostakovich in his  Symphony No. 14, amongst other poets (Lorca, Rilke) writing about death.\n   Art critic  Clement Greenberg selected Repin&#39;s painting as a bad example of &#34; kitsch&#34; in his influential essay   Avant-Garde and Kitsch (1939).  [5]\n   A trailer for the &#34;Cossacks&#34; expansion to the video game   Europa Universalis IV includes an altered version of the reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks (2015).  [6]\n The game   Cossacks: European Wars has the central detail of the picture in its logo.\n A parody of the painting was created in 2017 titled &#39;Letter to the Enemies of Russia&#39; by Vasily Nesterenko which depicts Russian soldiers in Syria writing a letter to President Erdogan of Turkey.\n  Several full-size copies of the Repin painting exist, including a famous reproduction by  Pavel Porfirov (Repin&#39;s student), currently held by the  Cincinnati Art Museum.\n  ^     a     b     c    Walther K.

Perhaps, she speculated, these journalists were jealous of her, \u201ca woman who wears size four\u201d and who has \u201cno trouble staying slim.\u201d Her theory was put to the test when  The Saturday Evening Post sent Joan Didion to profile her in 1968, the year that Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, would lose the Republican presidential primary to Richard Nixon. If not a competition of looks or a comparison of waistbands, then what could have accounted for the resulting article? \u201cPretty Nancy\u201d followed the style that was then becoming distinctive of Didion\u2019s journalistic prose: a blunt, self-assured series of descriptions and observations that lead the reader to believe she was just writing down what she saw. Here is Nancy pretending to pluck a rhododendron blossom. Here is Nancy finding her light. Here is Nancy wearing \u201cthe smile of a woman who seems to be playing out some middle-class American woman\u2019s daydream, circa 1948.\u201d 1     Nancy, of course, did not like Didion\u2019s profile. She found it sardonic and judgmental and accused Didion of having written the piece before they even met. She couldn\u2019t understand it, she said later. She thought they were having a nice time. 2 What is it about Joan Didion that seduces and then betrays? In her writing she promises little, and in her public life she offers even less. The title of Didion\u2019s new essay collection,  Let Me Tell You What I Mean, almost seems like the kind of cruel joke one might find in one of her pieces. Has a writer ever been less likely to say just what she means? Across the 12 works included\u2014which span Didion\u2019s entire career from her column in  The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1960s and \u201970s to one-off essays and reports for  The New Yorker to speeches given at her alma mater, as well as introductions to other people\u2019s books\u2014the impression one gets is that of reading a magazine made up of all ledes and kickers. This is the case with \u201cPretty Nancy,\u201d too. It contains many of Didion\u2019s trademarks. Her sentences often exist as aphorisms, all the more brutal for being brief; her choice of weapon tends to be the direct quote. These tendencies capture something true about her writing in general: Her essays show a writer who attempts a close reading of the powerful people and strange circumstances she encounters but then, when understanding proves difficult, draws back to look at them from a great, flat distance. 3  In  Blue Nights, her 2011 memoir about grief, family, and work, Didion said that when she and her husband, John Gregory Dunne, worked on dialogue for their screenplays, they would mark the time a character spent speaking before coming up with the words themselves: What was said was not as important as the rhythm and length of the speech. Her essays also have this novelistic approach. As Hilton Als notes in his foreword to  Let  Me Tell You What I Mean, \u201ca peculiar aspect of Joan Didion\u2019s nonfiction is that a significant portion of it reads like fiction.\u201d This appears to be the case, however, not because Didion is too imaginative in her journalistic renderings but rather because of her sense of control over the material and her certainty of its meaning, as though nothing happens without her permission. 4  One finds echoes of this approach in the way Didion circles around the California governor\u2019s wife, the tension hovering in the sharp point she holds back from making. There are inferences into what kind of person Nancy is, what kind of mother her teenage son might see her as, what kind of sycophantic circle a political family might live within. In many ways, Didion casts Nancy in a film of her own making. The writing could serve as cues for a character in a screenplay rather than as descriptions of a real-life woman in a magazine profile. 5 Let Me Tell You What I Mean includes a kind of corollary to \u201cPretty Nancy,\u201d Didion\u2019s 2000 profile of Martha Stewart (or, more to the point, of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia LLC), another story of a woman in the business of promising domestic harmony. \u201cThis is getting out of the house with a vengeance, and on your own terms,\u201d Didion writes, \u201cthe secret dream of any woman who has ever made a success of a PTA cake sale.\u201d Didion\u2019s sentences have a way of taking a person at face value and seeing the way subtle truths lie under glossy surfaces. 6  Other profiles are of groups, like her essay on a meeting of Gamblers Anonymous, in which she writes that she had to leave as soon as she heard the people there speak of \u201cserenity,\u201d because it is a word she associates with death. There is a profile of a building, too\u2014San Simeon, the castle William Randolph Hearst built with his newspaper fortune. Here, Didion\u2019s classic cruelties are put to good use, showing her disdain for the wealthy who never had to learn how to use their money wisely: \u201cSan Simeon was\u2026exactly the castle a child would build, if a child had $220 million and could spend $40 million of it on a castle.\u201d 7 When writing about what she likes, Didion finds herself drawn to her subjects with an intimate approach; she writes about them as if she is sharing their secret. In \u201cAlicia and the Underground Press,\u201d the subject is alternative newspapers, but the essay is really about the purportedly objective mainstream press and Didion\u2019s fatigue in the face of it\u2014she much prefers a journalistic tone that mimics a conversation between friends. \u201cThese papers ignore the conventional newspaper code,\u201d she explains in what, for her, can be read as praise, and instead \u201csay what they mean.\u201d When a writer at an underground newspaper has a thought, Didion adds, they say so, and best of all \u201cquite often in lieu of who, what, where, when, how.\u201d 8 But as the reader continues through the essays in this collection, her writing can also take on the feeling of being alone in someone else\u2019s living room: She is going through their homes in search of a secret. In her article about the Hearst castle, she critiques the childishness of grown men, and in \u201cOn Being Unchosen by the College of One\u2019s Choice,\u201d she critiques the overgrown precociousness in children. As with a face in profile, the angles are everything. 9 Didion loves other people\u2019s words, to turn them over and examine them from all sides. This does not necessarily mean that she is faithful to what they said: \u201cWhy I Write,\u201d a speech she gave at UC Berkeley and included here, is now frequently quoted in essays about Didion for its unrelenting admission that she considers writing a hostile act. She also returns in the speech to the cinematographer\u2019s lens: 10 Many people know about camera angles now, but not so many know about sentences. The arrangement of the words matters, and the arrangement you want can be found in the picture in your mind\u2026. The picture tells you how to arrange the words and the arrangement of the words tells you, or tells me, what\u2019s going on in the picture. 11\n The questions such a collection of essays demands\u2014for example, why these pieces, and why now?\u2014invite a cynical answer that is then attached, inextricably so, to the thought itself: Because these are the pieces that haven\u2019t been recently collected; because these are the pieces that can be sold either to the completist or to the casual reader. If this book does have a theme, it is one indistinguishable from what many readers already know about Didion: that all of this writing is less about the topic than about how Didion feels about it. This unanswerable approach can almost lead the reader to the point of hypnosis\u2014no matter the subject, her preferred subtext is what she won\u2019t tell and we can\u2019t know. Nancy Reagan probably had many reasons to feel betrayed by Didion\u2019s article, but the reason she was insulted had nothing to do with Didion\u2019s insincerity: She evades, but she does not lie. In her writing, she may not tell us what she means, but we can certainly sense how she feels. 12 Betrayal, of course, is possible only when a loyalty has been broken. Who, readers might ask, does Didion stand with? What is she for or against? In a 1972 essay, \u201cSeduction and Betrayal,\u201d Elizabeth Hardwick said that these two illicit actions have become a question more of psychology than of ethics. \u201cWe ask ourselves how the delinquent ones feel about their seductions, adulteries, betrayals, and it is by the quality of their feelings that our moral judgments are formed\u2026. In novelistic relations, where the pain inflicted is only upon the feelings of another person, everything is blurred.\u201d 13    When New York Review Books reissued this essay along with some of Hardwick\u2019s other essays in 2001, Didion made the following observation in her introduction: 14 At the time  Seduction and Betrayal was first published, a reviewer in  The New  York  Times complained that if the book had a fault, it was that its author failed to \u201cmake sufficient distinctions between the real and the literary.\u201d That there are no such distinctions to be made, that the women we invent have changed the course of our lives as surely as the women we are, is in many ways the point of this passionate book. 15\n This fuzziness that both Hardwick and Didion describe\u2014of novels that seem like biographies, of news reports that read like fiction\u2014is perhaps the only way to read Didion\u2019s work. Every profile is of a character; every article invents a story. As she told a student reporter for Berkeley\u2019s  Daily Californian in 2001: 16 The whole way I think about politics came out of the English Department. They taught a form of literary criticism which was based on analyzing texts in a very close way. If you start analyzing the text of a newspaper or a political commentator on CNN using the same approach of close textual analysis, you come to understand it in a different way. It\u2019s not any different from reading Henry James. 17\n For Didion, politics, like a novel, pulls from life but also can exists as fantasy, and can therefore be read like literature. 18 With this, a key is handed to those inclined to read Didion like code. A woman can accept her fate or she cannot, Didion seems to say again and again; she can play heroine, or she can escape the narrative altogether. The future awaits us either way. A woman with no loyalties is a Madame Bovary. A woman who cannot help her loyalties is an Anna Karenina. A woman who is the last to discover her own loyalties is an Isabel Archer. And a woman who will write book after book and essay upon essay without ever claiming her own loyalties is a Joan Didion. 19 In novels by Henry James and his contemporaries, being a journalist is something of a punishment to the journalist and to those around the journalist: Reporters, editors, and critics are a necessary burden on the social circles of much more interesting characters and a quiet threat to good manners. Like Henrietta Stackpole, the feminist journalist who acts as a comic foil for Isabel Archer in  The Portrait of a Lady, their presence signals someone who knows a secret is currency. We wait in suspense to see if they try to cash it in. 20    The curious thing about reading Didion is finding her agree with this literary assessment. In \u201cAlicia and the Underground Press,\u201d and in other essay collections like  Political Fictions and nonfiction books like  Miami, we often find Didion describing a certain kind of journalist as a marginal figure, at the boundaries of an event. Their access\u2014and their determination to keep it\u2014often is a central theme in her descriptions of her peers. 21 Perhaps that\u2019s why Didion has also so frequently become a subject for other writers, and a subject of such strong critiques. The many roles she occupies\u2014journalist, novelist, and screenwriter\u2014has made her an idol of publishing, and with that vaunted status comes an ever-rotating inquiry into who she is and what she believes. I\u2019m sure some people read Didion and think she\u2019s just fine, but given her style, fame, and other forms of capital and cachet, it is also hard not to notice the extremes of love and hate. Readers and subjects alike often report the same mistaken expectations, the same hurt feelings, as they periodically look to excavate some meaning or matter from the extensive collection of writing that exists by or about Didion. 22 When critics go looking for signs or theories about Didion, they often turn to her politics. Writing for  Popula, Maria Bustillos argued that she was \u201cthe First Lady of Neoliberalism\u201d and that the fandom around Didion misses the politics at the center of so much of her writing. \u201cThe weirdest thing about it,\u201d Bustillos writes, \u201cis this dyed-in-the-wool conservative woman\u2026somehow became the irreproachable darling of New York media and stayed that way for decades, all on the strength of a dry, self-regarding prose style and a \u2018glamor shot\u2019 with a Corvette.\u201d 23 Reading Didion\u2019s latest collection is enough to convince anyone that her writing is often more evocative than empathetic, more interested in style than in meaning. For some this might be primarily a literary feature of her writing, but for Bustillos this has made her journalism often read like \u201can unrelenting exercise in class superiority.\u201d And it is true that Didion\u2019s politics, while often contradictory and strange, were not all that inscrutable or indiscernible. She was a woman who loved Barry Goldwater, who told her friends that Nixon was too liberal, who unironically embraced a gently nostalgic interpretation of Americana and never missed an opportunity to cite a Hemingway sentence or a John Wayne scene. Her ideology is right there for the reader\u2014laid out on the page, waiting for your interpretation. 24 But a reader is not a voyeur, and an audience has its own autonomy. Didion\u2019s calculated vanity turns other people into a reflection that somehow manages to show nothing; this does indeed look, to a certain type of romantic, like seduction. She puts herself in view and then shuts the blinds. This may frustrate some readers, but it is hardly an act of \u201cbetrayal.\u201d I often think about a line in Robert McKee\u2019s popular and frequently skewered screenwriting manual,  Story, in which he says that he is always surprised to see audiences who want to know everything possible about a character over the span of one film. You couldn\u2019t know everything about a person in an entire lifetime, he reminds us. What makes you think you can get it all in a 90-minute movie? 25 There was a time when reading Didion made me feel like I had swallowed something that burned\u2014that I could taste what it might be like to make someone sick with desire\u2014and she retains that sense of being both divisive and adored; she will remain a powerful observer of our times and someone whose style people are quick to turn into metaphor. You could read every Joan Didion book ever released, study every sentence, look for her name in the margins of other biographies and in the bylines of archived clippings, in the credits rolling past on the screen, and still, you might know nothing. 26\n    In order to comment, you must be logged in as a paid subscriber.\u00a0 Click here to log in\u00a0or subscribe.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 03:35:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u592a\u6781,didion,warning", "title": "\u743c\u8fea\u592a\u6781\u7684\u6f2b\u957f\u89c2\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Joan Didion\u2019s Long View", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/joan-didion-tell-you-what-mean-review/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u592a\u6781", "didion", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c28e87ba9b1fb310a21aab809066587f.png", "infoid": 1067534, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0d\u77e5\u4f55\u6545\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u534a\u5f26\u534a\u51fd\u6570\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u91c7\u53d6\u4e00\u4e9b\u4efb\u610fCSS\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u914d\u7ed9React\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7CSS\u9009\u62e9\u5668We\uff06\uff0339;

You don&#39;t need to understand how cars work in order to drive, but it sure as heck helps when your car breaks down on the side of the road.\n Debugging CSS is hard enough on its own without adding in a layer of tooling magic! By demystifying styled-components, we&#39;ll be able to diagnose and fix weird CSS issues with way less frustration.\n In this blog post, we&#39;ll pop the hood and learn how it works by building our own mini-clone of \ud83d\udc85 styled-components.\n     styled-components comes with a collection of helper methods, each corresponding to a DOM node. There&#39;s  h1,  header,  button, and dozens more (they even support SVG elements like  line and  path!).\n The helper methods are called with a chunk of CSS, using an obscure JavaScript feature known as \u201ctagged template literals\u201d. For now, you can pretend that it&#39;s written like this:\n  h1 is a helper method on the  styled object, and we call it with a single argument, a string.\n These helper methods are little component factories. Every time we call them, we get a brand-new React component.\n   When we run  const Title = styled.h1(...), the  Title constant will be assigned to our  NewComponent component. And when we render the  Title component in our app, it&#39;ll produce an  &lt;h1&gt; DOM node.\n What about the  styles parameter that we passed to the  h1 function? How does it get used?\n  We come up with a unique class name by hashing  styles into a seemingly-random string, like  dKamQW or  iOacVe.\n  We inject a new CSS class into the page, using that hashed string as its name, and containing all of the CSS declarations from the  styles string.\n       In React, it&#39;s common to render some JSX conditionally. In this example, we only render our  &lt;Wrapper&gt; element if our  ItemList component is given some items:\n function ItemList({ items }) { if (items.length === 0) { return &#34;No items&#34;; } return ( &lt;Wrapper&gt; {/* Stuff omitted */} &lt;/Wrapper&gt; )}const Wrapper = styled.ul` background: goldenrod;`;// Rendering with an empty array:render(&lt;ItemList items={[]} /&gt;);\n It may surprise you to learn that styled-components doesn&#39;t do anything with the CSS we provided in this case. That  background declaration is never added to the DOM.\n Instead of eagerly generating CSS classes whenever a styled component is  defined, we wait until the component is  rendered before injecting those styles into the page.\n This is a good thing! On larger websites, it&#39;s not uncommon for  hundreds of kilobytes of unused CSS to be sent to the browser. With styled-components, you only pay for the CSS you render, not the CSS you write  .\n The only reason this works is because JavaScript has closures. Every component generated from  styled.h1 has its own little scope that holds the CSS string. When we render our  Wrapper component, even if it&#39;s seconds/minutes/hours later, it has exclusive access to the styles we&#39;ve written for it.\n There&#39;s one more reason that we defer CSS injection: because of interpolated styles. We&#39;ll cover those near the end of this article.\n  You might be wondering: how does that  createAndInjectCSSClass function work? Can we really generate new CSS classes from within JS?\n We can! One straightforward way is to create a  &lt;style&gt; tag, and then fill it with raw CSS text:\n  This method works, but it&#39;s cumbersome and slow. A more modern way to do this is with the CSSOM, the CSS version of the DOM. The CSSOM provides a friendlier way to add or remove CSS rules using JavaScript:\n  For a long time, styles generated through the CSSOM couldn&#39;t be edited in the Chrome developer tools. If you&#39;ve ever seen &#34;greyed out&#34; styles in the devtools, it&#39;s because of this limitation:\n   Thankfully, however, this changed in Chrome 85. If you&#39;re interested, the Chrome team  wrote a blog post about how they added support for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components to the devtools.\n    This works, but we need many many more helpers! We need buttons and links and footers and asides and marquees  .\n There&#39;s another problem, too. As we&#39;ll see,  styled can be called as a function directly:\n  The  styled object is both a function and an object. Bewilderingly, this is a totally valid thing in JavaScript. We can do stuff like this:\n  Let&#39;s update our styled-components clone to support these new requirements. We can borrow some ideas from functional programming to make it possible.\n  This code uses a technique known as  currying. It allows us to &#34;preload&#34; the  Tag argument.\n If you haven&#39;t seen it before, currying can be a bit mindbending. But it&#39;s helpful in this case, as it allows us to easily create many shorthand helper methods:\n     One of the coolest things about styled-components is that we can mix them with our own custom components!\n  function Message({ children, ...delegated }) { return ( &lt;p {...delegated}&gt; You&#39;ve received a message: {children} &lt;/p&gt; );}const UrgentMessage = styled(Message)` background-color: pink;`;render( &lt;UrgentMessage&gt; We&#39;re having a fire sale! &lt;/UrgentMessage&gt;);\n At first glance, this seems absolutely magical. How are we applying those styles to our custom component?\n The key is in the prop delegation. Here&#39;s what we&#39;d see if we logged out that  delegated object:\n     We come up with a unique class name ( OkjqvF), and render the  Tag variable (our  Message component) with a  className prop.\n This only works if we apply the  className prop to an HTML node inside our component though.  The following won&#39;t work:\n  By delegating all of the props that  Message receives to the  &lt;p&gt; element it renders, we unlock this pattern. Thankfully, many third-party components (eg. the  Link component in react-router) follow this convention.\n    const Button = styled.button` background-color: transparent; font-size: 2rem;`const PinkButton = styled(Button)` background-color: pink;`;render( &lt;PinkButton&gt;Hello World&lt;/PinkButton&gt;);\n I used to think that the library &#34;merged&#34; these styles somehow, creating a new &#34;mega class&#34; that contained all the declarations. But it actually creates two distinct classes.\n   Our goal in this process is to make sure that the  PinkButton styles &#34;extend&#34;  Button styles. In the event of a conflict,  PinkButton should win.\n Rather than overcomplicating things in JavaScript, we can rely on CSS to do the hard work for us!\n In CSS, there is a complex hierarchy of rules that governs how to resolve conflicts. An ID selector,  #btn, will win out against a class selector,  .btn. Which in turn beats a tag selector,  button.\n But in this case, we have two classes! The two selectors,  .abc123 and  .def456, are equally matched. So the algorithm falls back to a secondary rule. It looks at the order of rules defined in the stylesheet.\n  An important clarification: The order that we  apply the classes doesn&#39;t matter. Consider this case:\n  You might  expect that the first paragraph would be red, and the second paragraph would be blue. But that would be incorrect: both paragraphs will be blue. The order of the classes in the  class attribute doesn&#39;t matter:\n  The styled-components library takes great care to ensure that CSS rules are inserted in the correct order, to make sure that the styles are applied correctly. This is a non-trivial problem: we do all kinds of dynamic things in React, and the library is constantly adding/removing classes, while ensuring that a sensible order is preserved.\n  We need to update our code so that it applies both of the classes. We can combine them like so:\n  When we render  PinkButton, the  Tag variable is equal to our  Button component.  PinkButton will generate a unique class name ( def456), and pass that as the  className prop to  Button.\n If you&#39;re confused by this process, you&#39;re not alone; we&#39;ve entered the mindbending realm of recursion, where styled-components are rendering styled-components. As I wrote this article, I tripped over this bit, and had to spend a minute reconfiguring my own understanding.\n But here&#39;s the thing: the exact JS mechanics that accomplish this aren&#39;t important. That&#39;s an implementation detail. The important thing is that you understand these takeaways:\n styled-components makes sure to insert these rules in the correct order, so that  PinkButton&#39;s styles will overwrite any conflicts in  Button.\n  We&#39;ve almost finished creating our minimum-viable styled-components clone, but there&#39;s one more task in our list:  .\n Sometimes, our CSS will depend on React props. For example, an image might take a  maxWidth prop:\n const ContentImage = styled.img` display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: ${p =&gt; p.maxWidth};`;render( &lt;&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A running shoe with pink laces and a rainbow decal&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe.png&#34; maxWidth=&#34;200px&#34; /&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A close-up shot of the same running shoe&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe-closeup.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/&gt;)\n   The first class,  sc-bdnxRM, is used to uniquely identify the React component that was rendered ( ContentImage). It doesn&#39;t provide any styles, and we can ignore it for our purposes.\n  The seemingly-random class names,  JDSLg and  eXyedY, are actually hashes of the styles that will be applied. When we interpolate in a different  maxWidth prop, we get a different set of styles, and so a unique class is generated.\n This explains why we can&#39;t &#34;pre-generate&#34; the classes! We  have to wait until the component is rendered before we know what CSS will be applied, because the same  styled.button instance won&#39;t always produce the same styles.\n Interpolation isn&#39;t the only way we can customize the styles of one particular component instance. My personal favourite way is to use CSS variables. It looks like this:\n const ContentImage = styled.img` display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; width: 100%; max-width: var(--max-width);`;render( &lt;&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A running shoe with pink laces and a rainbow decal&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe.png&#34; style={{ &#39;--max-width&#39;: &#39;200px&#39;, }} /&gt; &lt;ContentImage alt=&#34;A close-up shot of the same running shoe&#34; src=&#34;/images/shoe-closeup.png&#34; /&gt; &lt;/&gt;)\n If we inspect the HTML, we&#39;ll notice that both elements share the same CSS class:\n  By letting modern CSS do the dynamic stuff for us, we produce less CSS. This is also a potential performance win: when the dynamic data changes, we don&#39;t need to generate a whole new CSS class and append it to the page!\n I wrote about this pattern (and many others!) in my blog post,  \u201cThe styled-components Happy Path\u201d.\n     Tagged template literals are wild, and it would take an entirely separate blog post to explain how they work and what they&#39;re doing here.\n The important thing to know is that all of those little interpolation functions are called when the component is rendered, and used to &#34;fill in the gaps&#34; in our style string.\n   When we render our component,  reconcileStyles is able to invoke each of those interpolated functions with the data passed through props. In the end, we&#39;re left with a plain ol&#39; string with populated values.\n When the props change, the process is repeated, and a new CSS class is generated.\n  This blog post has been  a journey. Perhaps more than any other post I&#39;ve written, this one covers some pretty treacherous terrain. This stuff is not easy to wrap our mind around.\n If parts of this post didn&#39;t make much sense to you, that&#39;s alright! It might require a bit of percolation. As you continue to use styled-components, hopefully the ideas in this post will become clear.\n In addition to the practical benefits of understanding your tools, I hope that this post also helps you appreciate what the styled-components team has accomplished. Building and maintaining open-source software is never easy, and it&#39;s  especially fraught when working on a CSS-in-JS tool, in a community where the entire category is contentious.\n If you found this post helpful, you might be interested in something else I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s called  CSS for JavaScript Developers. It&#39;s a comprehensive online course specifically created for JS framework devs who find CSS confusing or frustrating. We learn exactly how CSS works as a language, from first principles, building a robust mental model that can be used to solve just about every layout challenge you encounter.\n I&#39;m planning to launch the course in September of this year.

The OnePlus 8 was part of the phone-maker&#39;s 2020 lineup. Though the OnePlus 8 Pro was bigger in size and spec, the high-level specs on this standard model still make it a decent flagship phone in 2021. OnePlus phones have generally appealed to us by offering flagship-level specs and performance for less than the ever-ballooning price of most high-end smartphones. This year\u2019s Prime Day sale takes the $500-600\u00a0 OnePlus 8 down to $349, a much more competitive price that again gives more expensive (and less expensive) phones a run for their money.\n Just looking at the spec sheet, you can see that\u2014with 5G support (on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile), a 6.55-inch 402 pixels-per-inch OLED display with a 90 Hz refresh rate, 8GB RAM (albeit of the slower LPDDR4X variety), 128GB of UFS 3.0 storage, and Qualcomm\u2019s 2020 flagship Snapdragon 865 processor\u2014the OnePlus 8 is a phone that remains competitive. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no removable storage, though that&#39;s not out of the ordinary in 2021.\n     There are big specs in the battery and camera department, as well. The 4,300 mAh battery uses OnePlus\u2019 Warp Charge technology to juice the phone from 1 percent to half-full in 22 minutes, according to the company, and it tends to last about a day under normal usage. Wireless charging is not available, though. To allow for varying shots and artistic expression, the camera array includes three different cameras: one with a standard lens, one with a macro lens, and one with an ultrawide-angle lens. The cameras range from decent to not so great, though we had a few surprisingly good moments in\u00a0 our experience with the phone.\n  Thankfully, OnePlus is  one of the better phone OEMs with regard to Android updates: the updates usually land within a few weeks of each release, though the company often lags 1 to 3 months behind on security updates. The company&#39;s Oxygen OS still looks good and makes useful customizations to the Android operating system, but because the OnePlus 8 is already a year old, you should only expect one more major software update  for Android 12 and a little less than two years of security updates. The OnePlus 8&#39;s update prowess, good looks, low cost, and not-cheap-feeling hardware are a lot more than we can say for many Android phones in 2021, particularly at this price point.\n Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0  affiliate programs .", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:57:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u4ea4\u6613,\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a,day,oneplus", "title": "149\u7f8e\u5143\u7684oneplus 8\u662f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65e5\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4ea4\u6613 ", "title_en": "The OnePlus 8 for $349 is the best Prime Day smartphone deal", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-2021-best-smartphone-deals-oneplus-8/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u4ea4\u6613", "\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a", "day", "oneplus"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dd8894544d6c1664f7da11526a549ad3.jpg", "infoid": 1067530, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u62df\u8bae\u7684\u6536\u8d2d\u662f\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86MGM\u76844,000\u90e8\u7535\u5f71\u548c17,000\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76db\u4f1a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5e97\u9762\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u5176\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff01\u7528\u4e8e\u6309\u9700\u5a92\u4f53\u3002\n  \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6743\u5229\u53d8\u5316\u624b\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6d41\u666f\u89c2\u662f\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684;\u867d\u7136Netflix\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e0d\u8fdc\u5904\uff09\u548c\u8fea\u65af\u5c3c\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5907\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8282\u76ee\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5a92\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u5229\u6da6\u4e30\u539a\u7684\u5c3e\u5df4\u3002\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u5e94\u8be5\u62e5\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u5f71\u548c\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u4ea7\u5546\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u76f4\u63a5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u5185\u90e8\u751f\u4ea7\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5de8\u5934\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7ade\u4e89\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u884c\u4e1a\u5e1d\u56fd\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n FTC\u4e3b\u5e2dLina Khan  -

As an independent producer of films and TV a company can secure its own licensing deals and operate in direct competition with similar businesses. As a subsidiary of Amazon, it would likely be in large part reduced to an in-house production company for the retail and web giant, not competing on the merits of its products but as part of a multi-industry empire.\n FTC Chair Lina Khan \u2014  appointed just last week \u2014 has been among the foremost critics of the latter business model. Her now famous \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox\u201d paper asserted that Amazon uses dominance in one industry, like AWS in web hosting, to shore up other less successful arms, like its nascent delivery service. If the latter would fail without the support of the former, the argument (roughly) goes, the company is potentially engaging in anti-competitive behavior enabled by market power.\n That the market power and the behavior are in different verticals excused it under the antitrust doctrine of the recent era (so long as consumers didn\u2019t see price increases), but Khan aimed to challenge that doctrine with her paper \u2014 and now, as one of the most powerful regulators in the country, she has been given the chance to shape it firsthand.\n  Such large deals are always reviewed by federal authorities, and in this case the FTC is reportedly in charge, probably because it has already taken on the role of antitrust investigation into Amazon in other circumstances. It\u2019s also handling Facebook (which it has tangled with repeatedly over the years), while the agency\u2019s enforcement partners at the Justice Department took charge of looking into Google and Apple. (The FTC declined to comment, saying it does not confirm the existence of investigations.)\n In this case it seems unlikely that the Amazon purchase of MGM will be blocked, seeing as there is certainly real competition in the space and MGM has not been able to make its own way \u2014 a sale is almost inevitable. But the review will take place nonetheless, and it will likely elucidate how the FTC has changed its approach to this type of merger.\n It\u2019s entirely possible that even in a light-touch approval of this deal there will be opportunity to see new doctrine in play; for example, Amazon\u2019s arguably monopolistic position in ostensibly unrelated markets is likely to take a greater role than under previous FTC leadership. It may even set the stage for more comprehensive and aggressive reviews to come, or perhaps even rewinding previously approved mergers, something Chair Khan  has said is a distinct possibility.",

significant as it recognizes that Intel will be enabling SiFive\u2019s IP portfolio on its 7nm manufacturing process for upcoming foundry customers. We are expecting Intel to offer a wide variety of its own IP, such as some of the x86 cores, memory controllers, PCIe controllers, and accelerators, however the depth of its third party IP support has not been fully established at this point. SiFive\u2019s IP is the first (we believe) official confirmation of specific IP that will be supported.\n    Announced earlier this year by Pat Gelsinger, Intel Foundry Services (or IFS) is one prong of Intel\u2019s strategy to realign itself with the current and future semiconductor market. Despite having attempted to become a foundry player in the past, whereby they build chips under contract for their customers, it hasn\u2019t really worked out that well \u2013 however IFS is a new reinvigoration of that idea, this time with more emphasis on getting it right and expanding the scope.\n  To that end, Intel has been reorganizing its manufacturing and operations hierarchy into its own vertical group under Keyvan Esfarjani, with IFS led by Randhir Thakur as President reporting to this group.  As reported by CRN in the past week, Intel has recently hired a number of key talents from its foundry competition to aid this transition, including Hong Hao, the former head of Samsung\u2019s North American foundry business, to \u2018 formulate business strategies and execute customer engagement plans\u2019. Intel has also hired Bob Brennan, a former 22 year Intel employee most recently at Micron, as Vice President of Customer Design Enablement at IFS, assisting with end-to-end contract-to-product solutions for IFS customers. This includes engagement with Intel\u2019s Design Engineering Group, putting customers on the right track with Intel roadmaps.\n    Simply offering Intel\u2019s portfolio of technologies alone to customers isn\u2019t going to entice many customers, and in order to compete with other foundry competition, Intel needs to engage with other IP holders to provide design kits and tools for other technologies. For example, if an Intel Foundry Services customer wants to use an Intel core paired with a third party memory controller on Intel\u2019s 14nm process, that third party memory controller design has to be validated at Intel. Similarly, if a customer wants to combine Arm cores or other accelerators, that IP has to be validated. Intel has to create a structure of supported IP aside from their own, and today\u2019s announcement is one of the initial steps to that.\n    Today\u2019s announcement from SiFive is the launch of a new family of \u2018Performance\u2019 cores, debuting with the P270 and the P550. Both cores are Linux capable, with full support for the RISC-V vector extension v1.0rc, and the P550 is SiFive\u2019s highest performance core ever with a reported SPEC2006 int score of 8.65 per GHz. As part of that announcement, Intel is the lead development partner of the P550 core on Intel\u2019s own 7nm process. That\u2019s what the press release says.\n  In our emails with PR however, the wording was a little loose, and stated that\n  Intel recently selected SiFive to work with the Intel Foundry Services (IFS) business  to offer IP to Foundry customers. As part of the growth and development of the IFS business, IFS is creating \u2026 the P550 on the Intel 7nm.\n  The first sentence is critical here; it broadens the scope of the initial press release beyond simple co-operation of a singular IP core (the P550) into something more encompassing. The first step on such an endeavor would obviously be a proof point, such as enabling the P550, but then going beyond to other elements of SiFive\u2019s portfolio. How wide the scope is beyond the P550 has not been commented on at this time, however if all goes well, we could easily imagine a wide remit for SiFive solutions at any foundry.\u00a0 It should be noted that some musings have been made that Intel might be trying to acquire SiFive, however nothing that AnandTech could confirm or get comment on \u2013 the fact that the two companies are putting this announcement out today might dampen those rumors a little.\n  The fact that the press release also mentions 7nm is an interesting angle. We\u2019re covering what Intel is making with SiFive P550 in a separate news article, as it is big enough news to get its own title.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:49:26", "source_domain":

Reddit, the self-proclaimed front page of the internet, is determining what should and should not appear on its feeds.\n  When it comes to content moderation, which has become an ever more high-profile problem in recent years, Reddit opts for a different approach compared to other large social platforms.\n  Unlike Facebook, for example, which outsources much of the work to moderation farms, Reddit relies in large part on its communities (or subreddits) to self-police. The efforts of volunteer moderators are guided by rules defined by each individual subreddit, but also a   set of values authored and enforced by Reddit itself.\n  The company has come under criticism for this model, though, which some have interpreted as laissez-faire and lacking in accountability. But Chris Slowe, Reddit CTO, says this is a total mischaracterization.\n  \u201cIt may seem like a crazy thing to say about the internet today, but humans on average are actually pretty good. If you look at Reddit at scale, people are creative, funny, collaborative and derpy - all the things that make civilization work,\u201d he told  TechRadar Pro.\n  \u201cOur underlying approach is that we want communities to set their own cultures, policies and philosophical systems. To make this model function, we need to provide tools and capabilities to deal with the [antisocial] minority.\u201d\n  Slowe was the first ever Reddit employee, hired in 2005 as an engineer after renting out two spare rooms to co-founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. The three had met during the first run of now-infamous accelerator program Y Combinator, which left Slowe with fond memories but also a failed startup and time to fill.\n Although he took a break from Reddit between 2010-2015, Slowe\u2019s experience gives him a unique perspective on the growth of the company and how the challenges it faces have changed over time.\n  In the early years, he says, it was all about scaling up infrastructure to deal with traffic growth. But in his second stint, from 2016 to present, the focus has shifted to trust, security and user safety.\n \u201cWe provide users with tools to report content that violates site policies or rules set by moderators, but not everything is reported. And in some cases, the report is an indication that it\u2019s too late,\u201d he explained.\n \u201cWhen I came back in 2016, one of my main jobs was figuring out precisely how Reddit communities operate and defining what makes the site healthy. Once we had identified symptoms of unhealthiness, we worked from there.\u201d\n   Unlike other social platforms, Reddit has a multi-layered approach to content moderation, which is designed to adhere as closely as possible to the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity-first\u201d ethos.\n The most primitive form of content vetting is performed by the users themselves, who wield the power to upvote items they like and downvote those they don\u2019t. However, while this process boosts popular posts and squashes unpopular ones, popularity is not always a mark of propriety.\n The community mods act as the second line of defence and are armed with the power to remove posts and ban users for breaching guidelines or the content policy. The most common subreddit rule, according to Slowe, is essentially \u201cdon\u2019t be a jerk\u201d.\n The company\u2019s annual   Transparency Report, which breaks down all the content removed from Reddit each year, suggests mods are responsible for roughly two-thirds of all post removals.\n To catch any harmful content missed by the mods, there are the Reddit admins, who are employed by the company directly. These staff members perform manual spot checks, but are also armed with technological tools to help identify problem users and police one-on-one interactions that take place in private.\n \u201cThere are a number of signals we use to surface issues and establish whether individual users are trustworthy and have been acting in good faith,\u201d said Slowe. \u201cThe tricky part is that you\u2019ll never catch it all. And that\u2019s partly because  it is always going to be somewhat grey and context-dependent.\u201d\n Asked how this situation could be improved, Slowe explained he is caught in a difficult position; torn between a desire to uphold the company\u2019s community-first policy and knowledge that there are technologies coming to market that could help catch a greater percentage of abuse.\n For example, Reddit is already beginning to employ advanced  natural language processing (NLP) techniques to more accurately assess the sentiment of interactions between users. Slowe also gestured towards the possibility of using AI to analyze images posted to the platform and conceded that a larger quantity of moderation actions will occur without human input as time goes on.\n However, he also warned of the fallibility of these new systems, which are   prone to bias and certainly capable of error, and the challenges they might pose to the Reddit model.\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of terrifying, actually. If we\u2019re talking about this as an enforcement model, it\u2019s the same as putting cameras literally everywhere and relying on the great overmind of the machine to tell us when there\u2019s a crime,\u201d he said.\n Although erecting a technological panopticon might limit the amount of unsavory material that lands on the platform, doing so would ultimately require Reddit to cast aside its core philosophy: community above content.\n   Content moderation is a problem that none of the social media giants can claim to have nailed, as demonstrated by the debate surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s accounts and the banning of Parler from app stores. Reddit was also caught up in these conversations, eventually taking the decision to ban the r/DonaldTrump subreddit.\n As powerful as the community-first model may be, there is significant conflict at the heart of Reddit\u2019s approach. The company aspires to give its communities near-total autonomy, but is ultimately forced to make editorial decisions about where to draw the line.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the arbitrary, capricious arbiter of what content is correct and what\u2019s not,\u201d Slowe told us. \u201cBut at the same time, we need to be able to enforce a set of [rules]. It\u2019s a very fine line to walk.\u201d\n Reddit tries to keep its content policy as succinct as possible to eliminate loopholes and make enforcement easier, but revisions are common. For example, revenge pornography was banned on the platform in 2015 under ex-CEO Ellen Pao. Last year, the company added a clause that outlawed the glorification of violence.\n \u201cBeing true to our values also means iterating our values, reassessing them as we encounter new ways to game the system and push the edges,\u201d explained Slowe.\n \u201cWhen we make a change that involves moving communities from one side of the line to the other, that is the end of a long process of figuring out holes in our content policy and working backwards from there.\u201d\n However, while the majority will agree that the absence of revenge porn is an unqualified positive, and that incitement of violence took place on r/The_Donald, both examples are evidence that Reddit has to engage with moderation on the same plane as Facebook, Twitter or any other platform.\n When hard questions need to be asked, in other words, Reddit has found it needs to rely on its own muscle.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 02:48:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5229\u7528,moderation,reddit", "title": "Reddit\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5176\u793e\u533a - \u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5176\u7528\u6237\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5916\u5305\u5ba1\u6838\u573a ", "title_en": "How Reddit uses its community-first approach to moderate content, relying heavily on its users instead of outsourced moderation farms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/in/news/how-reddit-turned-its-millions-of-users-into-a-content-moderation-army", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5229\u7528", "reddit"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067525, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0b\u8f7dPDF\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334; uncthed castle\uff06\uff0334;\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7b49\u751a\u81f3\u4ecd\u7136\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u9ad8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u96c6\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5173\u8282\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4f7f\u7528Ajoint Optimization\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u548c\u5b83\u4eec\u7684ramensidizers\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e8f\u5217/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c13\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u5f0f/\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6765\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5bf9MLP\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\uff08i\uff09\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6b63\u89c4\u5316\u666e\u901a\u7684MLPSSignight MLPS\u663e\u7740\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u7b51\uff0c\uff08ii\uff09\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f20\u7edfML\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982XGBoost\u3002\n      \u4e66\u76ee\u5de5\u5177\u4ee3\u7801\uff06amp;\u5173\u4e8eArxivlabs Arxivlabs\u7684\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u65b0\u7684Arxiv\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n  \u4e0eArxivlabs\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u90fd\u63a5\u53d7\u5e76\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u793e\u533a\uff0c\u5353\u8d8a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002 Arxiv\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u53ea\u4e0e\u9075\u5b88\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5408\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5c06\u589e\u52a0Arxiv\uff06\uff0339;\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff1f\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u5173Arxivlabs\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Download PDF  Abstract: Tabular datasets are the last &#34;unconquered castle&#34; for deep learning, withtraditional ML methods like Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees still performingstrongly even against recent specialized neural architectures. In this paper,we hypothesize that the key to boosting the performance of neural networks liesin rethinking the joint and simultaneous application of a large set of modernregularization techniques. As a result, we propose regularizing plainMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks by searching for the optimalcombination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques for each dataset using ajoint optimization over the decision on which regularizers to apply and theirsubsidiary hyperparameters. We empirically assess the impact of theseregularization cocktails for MLPs on a large-scale empirical study comprising40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that (i) well-regularized plain MLPssignificantly outperform recent state-of-the-art specialized neural networkarchitectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong traditional ML methods,such as XGBoost.\n      Bibliographic Tools      Code &amp; Data      Related Papers       About arXivLabs   arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n  Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n  Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv&#39;s community?
