And yet it seems it&#39;s still possible to discover new things about his remarkable life.</p><p>关于托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）的文章，比恰好是850年前在坎特伯雷大教堂被枪杀的大主教，要多得多。然而，似乎仍然有可能发现有关他非凡人生的新事物。</p><p> Before dawn on 14 October 1164, Thomas Becket found an open gate in the city walls and rode out of Northampton with a servant and two guides, the sound of their horses&#39; hooves masked by high wind and driving rain.</p><p> 1164年10月14日拂晓前，托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）在城墙里发现了一扇敞开的大门，与一名仆人和两名向导一起骑兵从北安普敦（Northampton）骑出，他们的马声sound绕。蹄被大风和暴雨掩盖。</p><p> The archbishop was making a run for it after a week on trial in Northampton Castle. The initial charge had been a minor one, but King Henry II had added new and increasingly serious accusations, and a verdict of treason was looking likely.</p><p> 大主教在北安普敦城堡接受了一周的审判后，正在为此奔波。最初的指控是次要的，但亨利二世国王又增加了新的指控，而且指控日益严重，叛国罪的判决似乎很有可能。</p><p> Becket headed north, making it to Lincoln in two days, then put on the rough, dark woollen tunic of a local religious order, adopted the name Brother Christian, and turned south into the wilderness of the fens. His companions were genuine lay brothers, able to lead him through the marshes and waterways to isolated hermitages and priories, where he would be able to plan his next moves. Had he been caught, the leading Becket expert Prof Anne Duggan says, the king could have chosen any punishment he liked - castration, blinding, even death.</p><p> 贝克特（Becket）向北行驶，两天之内到达林肯，然后穿上当地宗教团体的粗，深色羊毛外衣，取名克里斯蒂安（Brother Christian），然后向南进入芬斯的荒野。他的同伴是真正的外行兄弟，能够带领他穿越沼泽和水道，到达偏僻的偏僻隐居和优先事项，在那里他可以计划下一步行动。领先的贝克特专家安妮·杜甘（Anne Duggan）教授说，如果他被抓了，国王本可以选择他喜欢的任何惩罚-ration割，致盲甚至死亡。</p><p>   He made it, ultimately, to Kent and was rowed from there to France in the first days of November.</p><p>   最终他到达肯特，并于11月初从那里划船到法国。</p><p> In exile he would need money, so before leaving Northampton, Becket had secretly sent his closest confidant, the scholar Herbert of Bosham, to Canterbury, to gather as much as he could and to take it to the Abbey of St Bertin, near Calais. But there was also one other thing he wanted Herbert to find - a certain little book.</p><p> 流亡期间他需要钱，所以贝克特在离开北安普敦之前，已经秘密地把他最亲密的知己博斯汉的学者赫伯特（Herbert of Bosham）送到坎特伯雷，以尽可能多地收集并带到加来附近的圣贝丁修道院。但是他还想让赫伯特找到另一件事-一本小书。</p><p> &#34;The implication is that it was a book that was very important to Becket, and that Herbert would know what it was,&#34; Anne Duggan says.</p><p> ＆＃34;暗示这是一本对贝克特非常重要的书，而赫伯特会知道那是什么，＆＃34;安妮·杜根（Anne Duggan）说。 </p><p> &#34;It&#39;s quite interesting that he doesn&#39;t tell us - so there is a mystery there. It wasn&#39;t a law book, it wasn&#39;t a gospel, it was a little book - a  codicella.&#34;</p><p>他没有告诉我们，这很有趣-所以那里有一个谜。这不是法律书籍，不是福音，而是一本小书-菊苣。</p><p>  In the summer of 2014, Dr Christopher de Hamel, then librarian of one of the smallest Cambridge colleges, invited to lunch a medieval historian, Dr Eyal Poleg. Over coffee, de Hamel mentioned that he&#39;d always thought it was odd that while any fragment of a saint&#39;s clothing had been regarded in the Middle Ages as a holy relic, saturated with the Holy Spirit and capable of working miracles, the saint&#39;s books were almost never regarded as such.</p><p>  2014年夏天，当时剑桥最小的学院之一的图书馆馆长克里斯托弗·德·哈默尔（Christopher de Hamel）邀请中世纪历史学家Eyal Poleg博士共进午餐。在喝咖啡时，德哈梅尔（De Hamel）提到，他一直以为奇怪的是，尽管中世纪的圣徒衣服的任何碎片都被视为圣物，充满了圣灵并且能够工作奇迹，圣人的书几乎从未被视为如此。</p><p>  De Hamel says Poleg said he knew of a counterexample and, tapping on his laptop, called up a list made in 1321 of treasures held in Canterbury cathedral. In Latin he read out loud: &#34;Item, a binding with the psalter of St Thomas, bound in silver gilt, decorated with jewels…&#34;</p><p>  德·哈默尔（De Hamel）说，波莱格（Poleg）说他知道一个反例，他轻敲笔记本电脑，调出了1321年坎特伯雷大教堂保存的宝藏清单。他用拉丁文大声朗读：＆＃34; Item，与圣托马斯诗篇的装订，装订在银色金上，饰有珠宝……＆＃34;</p><p> As he heard these words, de Hamel says he had &#34;one of those sudden heart-stopping shivers of recognition that make our lives as historians worthwhile&#34;. He&#39;d read them before - in one of the manuscripts he looked after in the Parker library, a collection bequeathed to Corpus Christi College Cambridge by a former archbishop of Canterbury, Matthew Parker, in 1574.</p><p> 德·哈默尔（De Hamel）听到这些话时说，他是“突然的令人心碎的认可寒颤之一，这使我们作为历史学家的生活值得”。他曾经读过这些书-在帕克图书馆看过的其中一部手稿中，这是坎特伯雷前大主教马修·帕克（Matthew Parker）在1574年将遗赠交给剑桥科珀斯克里斯蒂学院的收藏。</p><p>   De Hamel and Poleg abandoned their coffee and rushed across the 200-year-old &#34;New&#34; Court, to the library. De Hamel brought from the vault a 1,000-year-old psalter - a book of psalms - and showed Poleg a note added to one of the final pages about 500 years ago, in the time of Matthew Parker.</p><p>   德哈梅尔（De Hamel）和波莱格（Poleg）放弃了咖啡，冲向拥有200年历史的＆＃34; New＆＃34;法院，到图书馆。德哈梅尔（De Hamel）从金库中拿出了1000年的诗篇-一本诗篇-并向波勒格（Poleg）展示了大约500年前马修·帕克（Matthew Parker）时代的最后一页中添加的便条。</p><p> &#34;This psalter,  in boards of silver-gilt and decorated with jewels,&#34; it began, &#34;was once that of N, archbishop of Canterbury [and] eventually came into the hand of Thomas Becket, late archbishop of Canterbury, as is recorded in the old inscription.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;此诗篇，镀银-金，饰有珠宝，＆＃34;它开始了，曾经是坎特伯雷大主教N的名字，并最终由坎特伯雷大主教托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）掌控，正如旧铭文所记录的那样。</p><p>  Up until this moment the note had been taken with a pinch of salt - &#34;almost certainly a complete fiction&#34; was one recent assessment - but suddenly it was believable. The monks of Canterbury in 1321 certainly seemed to believe it.</p><p>  直到这一刻，笔记已经被夹上少许盐-＆＃34;几乎可以肯定是完整的小说＆＃34;是最近的一次评估-但突然之间，这令人难以置信。当然，1321年的坎特伯雷修士们似乎对此深信不疑。 </p><p> One reason for scepticism had been the psalter&#39;s absence from an early 14th Century inventory of the cathedral&#39;s manuscripts, a list that does include about 75 other volumes that had once belonged to Becket, along with the shelf numbers where they were kept in a passage way off the cloisters. (It&#39;s still a storage area today, de Hamel notes, where vergers keep their bicycles and gardeners their watering cans.)</p><p>怀疑的一个原因是诗篇没有出现在14世纪初期的大教堂手稿目录中，该目录确实包括曾经属于贝克特的其他75卷，以及书架号在哪里他们被隔离在回廊之外。 （德哈梅尔（De Hamel）指出，今天仍然是一个储藏区，佛瑞斯在这里存放自行车，园丁在这里存放喷壶。）</p><p> But this could now be explained: the psalter wasn&#39;t kept with the other manuscripts, but in a store room for valuables, or on the shrine of St Thomas - as Becket became within three years of his murder on 29 December 1170.</p><p> 但这现在可以解释了：诗篇与其他手稿并没有保存在一起，而是存放在贵重物品的储藏室中，或在圣托马斯神殿上-因为贝克特在1170年12月29日被谋杀三年内就成为了。</p><p> De Hamel and Poleg gazed at the 8in-by-6in manuscript &#34;trembling with excitement&#34;, de Hamel writes in a short book published earlier this year, The Book in the Cathedral: The Last Relic of Thomas Becket. There was no jewelled Anglo Saxon silver-gilt binding - this would have been torn off and melted down during the Reformation, but here was a book, de Hamel now felt, that was surely a lost holy relic of the Middle Ages.</p><p> 德·哈默尔（De Hamel）和波莱格（Poleg）激动地看着8乘6英寸的手稿，颤抖着颤抖。没有珠宝上的盎格鲁撒克逊银-金订书钉-在宗教改革时期，它会被撕毁并融化，但德哈默尔现在觉得这里有一本书，那肯定是中世纪遗失的圣物。</p><p>  As someone who has been familiar with Becket&#39;s manuscripts since the 1970s, de Hamel was aware of a curious habit of the Canterbury monks of that era: they took the description of each book in the inventory and copied it on to the flyleaf or the first page of the book itself.</p><p>  作为自1970年代以来就熟悉贝克特手稿的人，德哈默尔意识到了那个时代的坎特伯雷修士们的一种奇怪习惯：他们将清单中的每本书的描述都复制到了the页上或书籍本身的首页。</p><p> The front flyleaf of the psalter in front of de Hamel and Poleg had long been missing. But the Elizabethan note appeared to be a version of it, judging from the final phrase - &#34;as is recorded in the old inscription&#34;. Perhaps in the 16th Century it was already hard to read, or the flyleaf was loose? That would explain why someone might have copied it on to a different page. And as Henry VIII had ordered the obliteration of the cult of St Thomas of Canterbury not long before, it was understandable that the reference to &#34;St Thomas&#34; had been changed to &#34;Thomas Becket, late archbishop of Canterbury&#34;.</p><p> 在德哈默尔和波莱格面前的诗篇的前fly叶早已失踪。但是伊丽莎白时代的音符似乎是它的一个变体，从最后一句话-就像旧铭文中记录的一样。也许在16世纪已经很难读懂了，或者or叶很松？这将解释为什么有人可能将其复制到其他页面上。正如亨利八世在不久前下令消灭坎特伯雷的圣托马斯邪教一样，可以理解的是，对“圣托马斯”的提法。已更改为坎特伯雷已故大主教托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）。</p><p>  While the match between the entry in the 1321 inventory of cathedral relics and the note in the psalter was exciting, the note&#39;s wording also contained a puzzle.</p><p>  尽管1321年大教堂文物清单中的条目与诗篇中的音符之间的匹配令人兴奋，但音符的措辞也包含了一个谜。</p><p> The book was &#34;once that of N, archbishop of Canterbury [and] eventually came into the hand of Thomas Becket&#34;, it says. So who was N?</p><p> 书中说，这本书曾经是坎特伯雷大主教N的书，并最终由托马斯·贝克特（Thomas Becket）执掌。那谁是N？ </p><p> There is only one earlier archbishop whose name begins with N - Nothelm, in the early Eighth Century. And there is no way, de Hamel says, that this manuscript dates from that period. Judging from its style, it&#39;s generally thought to have been made in Canterbury around 1000.</p><p>在八世纪初，只有一个早期的大主教以N-Nothelm开头。德哈默尔说，这种手稿不可能追溯到那个时期。从其样式来看，通常认为它是在坎特伯雷（Canterbury）制造的，大约在1000年左右。</p><p> But de Hamel had an idea - perhaps the Elizabethan who annotated the psalter had mistaken the medieval AE - a combination of A and E - for an N? Sometimes they can look similar, he points out.</p><p> 但是德哈默尔有一个主意-也许注释诗篇的伊丽莎白女王时代把中世纪的AE（A和E的组合）误认为是N？他指出，有时它们看起来相似。</p><p>  As it happens, the first two archbishops of the 11th Century both have names beginning with AE - Aelfric and Aelfheah (commonly known as Alphege) - and de Hamel argues that the psalter belonged first to one and then the other.</p><p>  碰巧的是，11世纪的前两个大主教的名字都以AE开头-Aelfric和Aelfheah（通常称为Alphege），而de Hamel认为诗篇首先属于一个，然后是另一个。</p><p> There are clues that point towards this conclusion, he says, including two curious additions to the text.</p><p> 他说，有一些线索可以得出这个结论，其中包括对文本的两个奇怪的补充。</p><p> One is a litany of saints added to the end of the book, at roughly the same time the rest of the book was made, in which the names of two minor saints, Vincent and Eustace, appear in capital letters. This has previously been taken to suggest a connection between the psalter and the abbey of Abingdon, on the River Thames south of Oxford, which held important relics of both saints. De Hamel now suggests it is because the book belonged to Aelfric, who had been a monk at Abingdon, and possibly abbot, before he became archbishop in 995.</p><p> 一个是在书末增加的一连串圣人，大约是在本书其余部分的同一时间，其中以大写字母出现了两个未成年人的名字，文森特和尤斯塔斯。以前有人认为这是在牛津以南的泰晤士河上的诗篇诗人和阿宾登修道院之间的联系，那里保存着两位圣人的重要遗物。德哈默尔现在暗示这是因为这本书属于艾尔弗里克（Aelfric），他曾在Abingdon出家，可能是住持，直到995年成为大主教之前。</p><p>    The second addition consists of religious texts to be read in memory of Alphege, archbishop from 1006 to 1012, when he was beaten to death by Danes at Greenwich. The simplest explanation for this, de Hamel argues, is that the psalter belonged to Alphege and became associated with his cult after he was canonised in 1078.</p><p>    第二部分包括宗教文本，以纪念Alphege，从1006年到1012年的大主教，当时他在格林威治被丹麦人殴打致死。德·哈默尔认为，对此最简单的解释是，诗篇属于阿尔弗格，并在1078年将其封圣后与他的邪教联系在一起。</p><p> Alphege is recorded as joyfully reciting the psalms while in Danish captivity. Could it be, de Hamel asks, that he was holding this book when martyred? That would certainly have made it a relic in the eyes of the medieval church, he says, justifying the jewelled silver-gilt binding.</p><p> 据记载，Alphege在丹麦被囚禁期间快乐地朗诵诗篇。德哈默尔问，难道是he难时他拿着这本书吗？他说，那肯定会使它成为中世纪教堂眼中的遗物，证明镶有银silver金的珠宝是合理的。 </p><p>    So there are now two candidates for the N mentioned in the inscription - Aelfric and Alphege.</p><p>因此，题词中提到的N现在有两个候选人-Aelfric和Alphege。</p><p> Alphege appears to have been particularly important to Becket, who &#34;in some way adopted Alphege as a patron saint&#34; de Hamel says. Becket&#39;s sermon in Canterbury Cathedral on Christmas Day 1170, just days before he was murdered, was on the death of St Alphege. And according to two contemporary accounts of the archbishop&#39;s death, one by an eyewitness, his final words were to commend his soul into St Alphege&#39;s care.</p><p> Alphege对Becket似乎特别重要，他以某种方式采用Alphege作为赞助人圣人。德哈默尔说。在他被谋杀的前几天，贝克特（Becket）的布道于1170年圣诞节在坎特伯雷大教堂举行，当时他的死是在圣阿尔弗格（St Alphege）死后。根据两个关于大主教之死的当代说法，其中一个是目击者，他的最后一句话是表扬他的灵魂受到圣阿尔弗基的照料。</p><p>  When de Hamel told this story in a lecture to the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2017, Anne Duggan was in the audience, and asked a question about the &#34;little book&#34; she had long wondered about.</p><p>  当德哈默尔（De Hamel）在2017年伦敦伦敦古玩学会的一次演讲中讲述了这个故事时，安妮·杜根（Anne Duggan）在场，并问起有关这本《小书》的问题。她很想知道。</p><p> In his biography of Becket, Herbert of Bosham says the archbishop told him &#34;to take care of a particular book of his, lest when his flight was known to other people, it might be destroyed in the plundering&#34; (using the translation in de Hamel&#39;s book). He goes on to say that although Becket was &#34;rightly indifferent to possessions&#34; - actually he was renowned for his extravagance - &#34;there was at least one little book that he cared about&#34;.</p><p> 博舍姆的赫伯特在赫本（Becket）的传记中说，大主教告诉他“要照顾好他的一本特殊的书，以免当其他人知道他的飞行时，它可能会在掠夺中被摧毁”。 （使用de Hamel书中的翻译）。他继续说，尽管贝克特对财物一视同仁。 -实际上，他以自己的铺张而闻名-＆＃34;他至少关心一本小书。</p><p>  De Hamel  can be seen on the video of the lecture listening with wide eyes and open mouth. &#34;I feel a shiver going down my spine,&#34; he says. Becket was probably already thinking about martyrdom, he adds, and the &#34;evocative association with this martyr&#39;s book must have mattered to him enormously&#34;.</p><p>  在演讲视频中可以看到De Hamel睁大眼睛和张开嘴巴听。 ＆＃34;我感到脊椎发抖，＆＃34;他说。他补充说，贝克特可能已经在考虑难了，与此this难者书中令人回味的联想一定对他有重大影响。</p><p> In his book, he comments: &#34;It may have been his most intimate possession. He probably took it to bed.&#34;</p><p> 他在书中评论：＆＃34;可能是他最亲密的财产。他可能把它睡觉了。＆＃34;</p><p>  Drawing on his deep knowledge of medieval manuscripts, de Hamel tells a gripping tale, extrapolated from tiny clues. But is it true?</p><p>  凭借对中世纪手稿的深入了解，德哈默尔讲述了一个令人抓狂的故事，该故事是从微小线索中推断出来的。但这是真的吗？ </p><p> &#34;I wasn&#39;t there when Becket died,&#34; he tells the BBC, &#34;and all the narrative constructed here [in the book] is like a detective story drawing on multiple strands of evidence, which all converge at the same and simplest conclusion. You must decide, gentlemen of the jury, whether you are convinced.&#34;</p><p>当贝克特死后，我不在那儿，他告诉英国广播公司（BBC），这里[在书中]构造的所有叙述都像侦探小说一样，借鉴了多条证据，所有这些证据都汇聚在同一且最简单的结论上。陪审团的先生们，您必须确定自己是否被说服。</p><p> He says he&#39;s certain that this is the psalter listed in Canterbury&#39;s 1321 inventory of valuables and that the monks accepted it as having been Becket&#39;s. Not a shred of evidence has led him to doubt that they were right, he says.</p><p> 他说，他确定这是坎特伯雷（Canterbury）1321年贵重物品清单中列出的诗篇，并且僧侣认为它是贝克特（Becket）的。他说，没有丝毫证据使他怀疑它们是正确的。</p><p> The idea that it belonged to Aelfric and Alphege is supposition but &#34;overwhelmingly likely&#34; he adds, and it is even more likely that Becket  thought it was Alphege&#39;s.</p><p> 它属于Aelfric和Alphege的想法是假设，但“很有可能”。他补充说，Becket认为这是Alphege的可能性更大。</p><p> &#34;Fascinating hypothesis&#34; is the verdict of de Hamel&#39;s successor as Parker librarian at Corpus Christi College, Dr Philippa Hoskin.</p><p> ＆＃34;有趣的假设＆＃34;是科珀斯克里斯蒂学院的帕克图书管理员de Hamel的继任者Philippa Hoskin博士的判决。</p><p>  But Eyal Poleg, who left his coffee and rushed with de Hamel to the Parker library to gaze excitedly at the psalter, advises caution.</p><p>  但是，埃亚尔·波勒格（Eyal Poleg）离开咖啡，随德哈梅尔（de Hamel）奔赴帕克图书馆，兴奋地凝视着诗篇，他建议人们谨慎。</p><p> &#34;I think the only thing we can say for certain is that in the 14th Century this is seen as the psalter of Thomas Becket in Canterbury. I think that&#39;s where we start and that&#39;s where we stop.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我认为我们唯一可以确定的是，在14世纪，这被视为坎特伯雷的托马斯·贝克特的诗篇。我认为那是我们开始的地方，那是我们停止的地方。</p><p> There&#39;s no evidence that it actually was Becket&#39;s psalter, he says, and he&#39;s not persuaded that it belonged to Aelfric or Alphege. Also he doesn&#39;t think it was necessarily regarded as a relic of St Thomas of Canterbury. (As he remembers the initial after-lunch conversation, he and de Hamel were talking about sacred texts in elaborate bindings - referred to in Latin as  textus - and both remarked that they only knew of one that was a psalter, leading to the sudden realisation.)</p><p> 他说，没有证据表明它实际上是贝克特的诗篇，并且他没有说服它属于Aelfric或Alphege。他也不认为这一定是坎特伯雷圣托马斯的遗物。 （当他记得午餐后的最初谈话时，他和德哈默尔谈论的是精心制作的圣经中的神圣文本-拉丁语中称为textus-都说他们只知道一个诗篇，导致突然意识到） </p><p>  Another expert with doubts is Prof Alexander Heslop of the University of East Anglia. He believes the psalter&#39;s capital letters were based on designs created by a master scribe, Eadwig Basan, who is not known to have been working in Canterbury until a few years after Alphege&#39;s death.</p><p>另一个有疑问的专家是东英吉利大学的亚历山大·赫斯洛普教授。他认为，诗篇的大写字母是基于大师级抄写员Eadwig Basan的设计而来的，Eadwig Basan直到Alphege死后才在坎特伯雷工作。</p><p> None of this necessarily means that de Hamel&#39;s theory is incorrect, though if Heslop is right Aelfric and Alphege may have to drop out of the picture.</p><p> 这一切都不一定意味着德哈默尔的理论是不正确的，尽管如果赫斯洛普是正确的话，艾尔弗里克和阿尔弗格可能不得不退出现实。</p><p> &#34;When you&#39;re a medievalist, you&#39;re kind of in the dark, and you&#39;re grasping for things, you&#39;re hoping to find something to hold on to,&#34; says Lloyd de Beer, curator of the British Museum&#39;s forthcoming exhibition on Becket, delayed by the pandemic to the spring. &#34;And the thing about Christopher&#39;s work, because he writes so beautifully, and you read such a kind of compelling story, is that he really brings you very close to this history.&#34;</p><p> 当您是一名中世纪主义者时，您就像是在黑暗中，而您正在抓紧事物，您希望找到可以保留的东西， 34;大英博物馆即将在贝克特举办的展览的策展人劳埃德·德·比尔（Lloyd de Beer）说，大流行推迟到了春季。克里斯托弗（Christopher）的作品之所以如此，是因为他写得如此优美，而您读到的是这样一种引人入胜的故事，是因为他确实使您非常了解这段历史。</p><p>  &#34;There&#39;s just still some work to be done, but that&#39;s what&#39;s great about Christopher, he&#39;s throwing out all these big ideas and the best kind of scholars leave those trails.&#34;</p><p>  仍然有一些工作要做，但这就是克里斯托弗的妙处所在，他抛弃了所有这些大思想，而最好的学者离开了这些足迹。＆＃34;</p><p>  During his six years in exile in France, Becket&#39;s negotiations with Henry II, mostly carried out through intermediaries, succeeded in papering over some of the cracks in their relationship, but there had been no kiss of peace before Becket re-crossed the Channel in early December 1170. Some of those close to him warned him not to do it; others pointed out that martyrdom might be a positive outcome.</p><p>  在流亡法国的六年中，贝克特与亨利二世的谈判主要通过中间人进行，成功地化解了他们之间的某些裂痕，但在贝克特重归于好之前，并没有和平之吻。 1170年12月上旬在海峡。一些接近他的人警告他不要这样做；其他人指出难可能是积极的结果。</p><p> Becket massively increased the danger on the eve of his departure by suspending or excommunicating three bishops who had taken part in the coronation of Henry&#39;s son, Henry the Young King, who was now serving as co-ruler. It was this that precipitated the events of 29 December.</p><p> 贝克特通过暂停或驱逐参加亨利儿子亨利年轻国王加冕典礼的三位主教，大大增加了他离任前夕的危险。正是这一点促成了12月29日的事件。</p><p> Christopher de Hamel believes the archbishop may have read the psalter the night before four barons broke into the cathedral to arrest him and - when he refused to go - killed him with sword blows to the head. He even wonders whether Thomas was holding the psalter when he died, though he acknowledges that none of Becket&#39;s contemporary biographers mention this.</p><p> 克里斯托弗·德·哈默尔（Christopher de Hamel）认为，大主教可能在四名男爵闯入大教堂逮捕他的前一天晚上读过诗篇，并且-当他拒绝离开时-用剑头砸死了他。他甚至想知道托马斯死后托马斯是否抱着诗篇，尽管他承认贝克特的当代传记作者都没有提到这一点。 </p><p>  Vespers in the cathedral was coming to an end when the attack occurred in the north transept - it would have been out of sight of the worshippers in the nave, but they would have heard everything. One of the fully armed barons stood guard to prevent anyone coming to Becket&#39;s aid.</p><p>当袭击发生在北半部时，大教堂中的Vespers即将结束-教堂中殿的信徒本来是看不见的，但他们会听到一切。全副武装的男爵之一守卫着警卫，以防止任何人来贝克特的援助。</p><p> People began scooping up his blood almost immediately, in the expectation that it would work miracles - and these soon began to be reported. Canterbury then became for 300 years one of Europe&#39;s main centres of pilgrimage, a fact that the British Museum will emphasise with &#34;extraordinary&#34; loans from across the continent.</p><p> 人们开始几乎立刻sc起他的血，希望这会产生奇迹-很快就开始报道了这些。坎特伯雷（Canterbury）随后成为欧洲主要的朝圣中心之一，已有300年的历史了，大英博物馆将特别强调这一事实。来自整个非洲大陆的贷款。</p><p> In time, the east end of the cathedral was rebuilt in pink-tinged stone around  a shrine to Becket, also in pink stone with a golden canopy. The psalter, in its jewelled binding, would have been carried in procession to the altar nearby.</p><p> 随着时间的流逝，大教堂的东端用粉红色的石头围绕着贝克特的神built重建，同样用粉红色的石头和金色的天篷重建。诗篇以其宝石般的装束，将被带到附近的祭坛。</p><p>  But like everything connected with Becket and his cult, the shrine was destroyed on Henry VIII&#39;s orders in 1538. Officials smashed two stained glass windows that must have depicted the life of Becket, says Anne Duggan, but left others intact, probably because they didn&#39;t realise they contained images of the martyred archbishop. Some of the fragments of stone from the shrine were re-used in Canterbury and have been gathered up over the years.</p><p>  但是就像与贝克特及其崇拜者有关的一切事物一样，圣殿在1538年根据亨利八世的命令被摧毁。安妮·杜根说，官员们砸碎了两个描绘贝克特生平的彩色玻璃窗，但其他人则完好无损。因为他们没有意识到其中包含the难的大主教的图像。靖国神社的一些石头碎片在坎特伯雷（Canterbury）被重新使用，并已收集了多年。</p><p> Apart from that, all that remains are the 146 parchment leaves of the psalter, and it will go on display in the British Museum, along with one of the surviving fragments of rose marble.</p><p> 除此之外，剩下的全部是146首诗篇的羊皮纸叶子，它将与大英博物馆中尚存的玫瑰大理石碎片之一一起展出。</p><p> &#34;The discovery of this book at Corpus Christi college really provides a kind of tangible connection to Becket&#39;s cult in the Middle Ages at Canterbury,&#34; says Lloyd de Beer. &#34;And considering that almost nothing survives, that&#39;s a really exciting thing.&#34;</p><p> 科珀斯克里斯蒂学院的这本书的发现确实为贝克特在坎特伯雷的中世纪崇拜提供了一种切实的联系。劳埃德·戴比尔（Lloyd de Beer）说。考虑到几乎没有任何东西可以幸存，这是一件非常令人兴奋的事情。</p><p> Photographs of the Parker Library psalter are courtesy of the Master and Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</p><p> 帕克图书馆诗篇的照片由剑桥科珀斯克里斯蒂学院的硕士和研究员提供 </p><p> The psalter, known as MS 411, can be  viewed page by page on the Parker Library On the Web</p><p>可以在Parker Library的网页上逐页查看称为MS 411的诗篇</p><p> You can listen to  Christopher de Hamel talking about Becket and the psalter  with Andrew Marr on Start the Week (December 2020), or watch him  discussing other Parker Library manuscripts  with Newsnight&#39;s Stephen Smith (October 2016)</p><p> 您可以在``开始一周''（2020年12月）上听克里斯托弗·德·哈默尔（Christopher de Hamel）与安德鲁·马尔（Andrew Marr）谈论贝克特和诗篇，或者观看他与《新闻之夜》的史蒂芬·史密斯（Stephen Smith）讨论其他帕克图书馆的手稿（2016年10月）</p><p>  A clause in Matthew Parker&#39;s bequest insists on an annual audit and says that if six large manuscripts or 12 small ones are found to have been lost the entire collection passes to Gonville and Caius college, and from there, if further manuscripts are lost, to Trinity Hall college. (None have yet been lost.)</p><p>  马修·帕克（Matthew Parker）遗赠中的一项条款要求进行年度审核，并说，如果发现丢失了六本大手稿或12个小手稿，则整个收藏将转到贡维尔大学和凯斯学院，如果还有其他手稿，则从那里进行。输给了三一堂学院。 （尚未丢失。）</p><p> The library includes the Sixth Century Gospels of Saint Augustine, which is taken to Canterbury to swear in all new archbishops, and the original of the Anglo-Saxon chronicle.</p><p> 图书馆中有圣奥古斯丁六世纪福音传给坎特伯雷（Canterbury）在所有新的大主教中宣誓，以及盎格鲁-撒克逊编年史的原著。</p><p> It also has another of Becket&#39;s books, his copy of John of Salisbury&#39;s Polycraticus and Metalogicon. As with many of Becket&#39;s books, his name, where it was written on the front flyleaf, was erased in the 16th Century. &#34;I suspect that I handled it more often than Becket did,&#34; de Hamel writes.</p><p> 它还有贝克特（Becket）的另一本书，他的著作为《索尔兹伯里的约翰（Salisbury's Polycraticus）和Metalogicon》。与贝克特的许多书籍一样，他的名字写在前叶上，在16世纪被抹去了。 ＆＃34;我怀疑我比贝克特更经常地处理它，＆＃34;德哈默尔写道。</p><p> The psalter is sometimes referred to noncommittally as &#34;the Becket psalter&#34;, meaning &#34;the psalter that has the note in it that says it is connected to Becket&#34;, says librarian Philippa Hoskin.</p><p> 诗篇馆长Philippa Hoskin表示，有时将诗篇有时毫无疑问地称为“贝克特诗篇”，意为“其中带有注释的诗篇与贝克特相连”。</p><p>   Long hair and a beard, sandals and a robe. Everyone knows what Jesus looked like. Or do they?</p><p>   长长的头发和胡须，凉鞋和长袍。每个人都知道耶稣的模样。还是他们？ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-55370722">https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-55370722</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/thomas/">#thomas</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/becket/">#becket</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/诗篇/">#诗篇</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
