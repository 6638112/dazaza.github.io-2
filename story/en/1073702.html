For four years, Campbell had been using a high-tech implant in her left eye that gave her a crude kind of bionic vision, partially compensating for the genetic disease that had rendered her completely blind in her 30s. “I remember exactly where I was: I was switching from the 6 train to the F train,” Campbell tells  IEEE Spectrum. “I was about to go down the stairs, and all of a sudden I heard a little ‘beep, beep, beep’ sound.”</p><p>芭芭拉·坎贝尔（Barbara Campbell）在高峰时段穿过纽约市的一个地铁站时，她的世界突然变黑了。四年来，坎贝尔一直在左眼使用高科技植入物，这给了她一种粗糙的仿生视力，部分弥补了30多岁时导致她完全失明的遗传疾病。坎贝尔告诉IEEE Spectrum：“我清楚地记得我当时在哪里：我从6号列车换到了F号列车。”。“我正要下楼，突然听到一点‘哔，哔，哔’的声音。”</p><p> It wasn’t her phone battery running out. It was her Argus II retinal implant system powering down. The patches of light and dark that she’d been able to see with the implant’s help vanished.</p><p>不是她的手机电池没电了。是她的Argus II视网膜植入系统断电。在植入物的帮助下，她能看到的光和暗的补丁消失了。</p><p>  Terry Byland is the only person to have received this kind of implant in both eyes. He got the first-generation Argus I implant, made by the company 	 Second Sight Medical Products, in his right eye in 2004 and the subsequent Argus II implant in his left 11 years later. He helped the company test the technology, spoke to the press movingly about his experiences, and even  met Stevie Wonder at a conference. “[I] went from being just a person that was doing the testing to being a spokesman,” he remembers.</p><p>Terry Byland是唯一一位接受过这种双眼植入手术的人。2004年，他在右眼植入了由Second Sight Medical Products公司制造的第一代Argus I植入物，11年后在左眼植入了随后的Argus II植入物。他帮助该公司测试了这项技术，向媒体生动地讲述了自己的经历，甚至在一次会议上见到了史蒂夫·旺德。“我从一个做测试的人变成了一个发言人，”他回忆道。</p><p> Yet in 2020, Byland had to find out secondhand that the company had abandoned the technology and was on the verge of going bankrupt. While his two-implant system is still working, he doesn’t know how long that will be the case. “As long as nothing goes wrong, I’m fine,” he says. “But if something does go wrong with it, well, I’m screwed. Because there’s no way of getting it fixed.”</p><p>然而，在2020年，Byland不得不间接发现，该公司已经放弃了这项技术，濒临破产。虽然他的双植入系统仍在工作，但他不知道这种情况会持续多久。“只要没事，我就没事，”他说。“但如果真的出了问题，我就完蛋了。因为没办法把它修好。”</p><p>  Ross Doerr, another Second Sight patient, doesn’t mince words: “It is fantastic technology and a lousy company,” he says. He received an implant in one eye in 2019 and remembers seeing the shining lights of Christmas trees that holiday season. He was thrilled to learn in early 2020 that he was eligible for software upgrades that could further improve his vision. Yet in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, he heard troubling rumors about the company and called his Second Sight vision-rehab therapist. “She said, ‘Well, funny you should call. We all just got laid off,’ ” he remembers.	  “She said, ‘By the way, you’re not getting your upgrades.’ ”</p><p>另一位复视患者罗斯·多尔直言不讳地说：“这是一项了不起的技术，一家糟糕的公司，”他说。2019年，他接受了一只眼睛的植入手术，并记得在那个节日看到了圣诞树上闪闪发光的灯光。2020年初，他得知自己有资格进行软件升级，从而进一步提高自己的视力，感到非常激动。然而在2019冠状病毒疾病的早期，他听到了有关公司的令人不安的传言，并称他的第二视力康复理疗师。“她说，‘好笑，你应该打电话。我们都刚刚被解雇，’”他回忆道。“她说，‘顺便说一句，你没有升级。’”</p><p> These three patients, and more than 350 other blind people around the world with Second Sight’s implants in their eyes, find themselves in a world in which the technology that transformed their lives is just another obsolete gadget. One technical hiccup, one broken wire, and they lose their artificial vision, possibly forever. To add injury to insult: A defunct Argus system in the eye could cause medical complications or interfere with procedures such as MRI scans, and it could be painful or expensive to remove.</p><p>这三名患者，以及全世界350多名眼睛植入了“第二视力”的盲人，发现自己身处的世界里，改变他们生活的技术只是另一个过时的小玩意。一次技术故障，一根断丝，他们就失去了人工视觉，可能会永远失去。雪上加霜：眼睛中一个失效的Argus系统可能会导致医疗并发症或干扰MRI扫描等程序，移除它可能会很痛苦或昂贵。</p><p>  Neural implants—devices that interact with the human nervous system, either on its periphery or in the brain—are part of a rapidly growing category of medicine that’s sometimes called electroceuticals. Some technologies are well established, like deep-brain stimulators that  reduce tremors in people with Parkinson’s disease. But recent advances in neuroscience and digital technology have sparked a gold rush in brain tech, with the outsized investments epitomized by Elon Musk’s buzzy brain-implant company,  Neuralink. Some companies talk of reversing depression, treating Alzheimer’s disease, restoring mobility, or even dangle the promise of superhuman cognition.</p><p>神经植入与人类神经系统（无论是在其外围还是在大脑中）相互作用的设备是一个快速增长的医学类别的一部分，有时被称为电中微子。一些技术已经成熟，比如可以减少帕金森病患者震颤的脑深部刺激器。但神经科学和数字技术的最新进展引发了脑科技领域的淘金热，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）旗下轰动一时的脑植入公司Neuralink就是一例。一些公司谈论逆转抑郁症、治疗阿尔茨海默氏症、恢复机动性，甚至动摇超人认知的承诺。</p><p> Not all these companies will succeed, and Los Angeles–based Second Sight provides a cautionary tale for bold entrepreneurs interested in brain tech. What happens when cutting-edge implants fail, or simply fade away like yesterday’s flip phones and 	 Betamax? Even worse, what if the companies behind them go bust?</p><p>并非所有这些公司都会成功，而洛杉矶的《第二视线》为对脑技术感兴趣的大胆创业者提供了一个警示故事。当尖端植入物失败，或者像昨天的翻盖手机和Betamax一样消失时，会发生什么？更糟糕的是，如果背后的公司破产了怎么办？</p><p> After Second Sight discontinued its retinal implant in 2019 and nearly went out of business in 2020, 	 a public offering in June 2021 raised US $57.5 million at $5 per share. The company promised to focus on its ongoing clinical trial of a brain implant, called Orion, that also provides artificial vision. But its stock price plunged to around $1.50, and in February 2022, just before this article was published, the company  announced a proposed merger with an early-stage biopharmaceutical company called  Nano Precision Medical (NPM). None of Second Sight’s executives will be on the leadership team of the new company, which will focus on developing NPM’s novel implant for drug delivery.</p><p>在第二次视力停止后，视网膜植入物在2019和2020几乎倒闭，2021年6月的公开募股以每股5美元的价格提高了5750万美元。该公司承诺将专注于正在进行的一种名为Orion的大脑植入物的临床试验，该植入物也可以提供人工视觉。但其股价暴跌至1.50美元左右，2022年2月，就在本文发表之前，该公司宣布了与一家早期生物制药公司Nano Precision Medical（NPM）的拟议合并。Second Sight的高管都不会加入新公司的领导团队，该公司将专注于开发NPM的新型药物输送植入物。</p><p>  The company’s current leadership declined to be interviewed for this article but did provide an emailed statement prior to the merger announcement. It said, in part: “We are a recognized global leader in neuromodulation devices for blindness and are committed to developing new technologies to treat the broadest population of sight-impaired individuals.”</p><p>该公司目前的领导层拒绝接受本文的采访，但在宣布合并之前提供了一份电子邮件声明。它在一定程度上说：“我们是全球公认的盲人神经调节设备的领导者，并致力于开发新技术来治疗最广泛的视力受损人群。”</p><p> Spectrum pieced together Second Sight’s story by interviewing half a dozen patients, a company cofounder, and eight doctors or researchers involved with the company. In their telling, the company took hundreds of patients on a roller-coaster ride of technological innovations, regulatory successes, medical and financial setbacks, and a near-total meltdown. Now, as the company fades away, the future of high-tech vision implants seems blurrier than ever.</p><p>Spectrum通过采访六名患者、一名公司联合创始人以及与该公司有关的八名医生或研究人员，拼凑出了Second Sight的故事。在他们的讲述中，该公司让数百名患者坐上了技术创新、监管成功、医疗和财务挫折以及几乎完全崩溃的过山车。现在，随着该公司的衰落，高科技视觉植入物的未来似乎比以往任何时候都更加模糊。</p><p> Second Sight began with a flash of light. In 1991,  Robert Greenberg , an electrical engineer turned medical student, stood in an operating room watching as a retinal surgeon inserted a tiny wire into the eye of a blind patient, who was awake and under local anesthesia. When the wire touched the patient’s retina and delivered a minuscule jolt of electric current, the man reported a spot of light in his pitch-black field of vision. The surgeon inserted a second wire, and the man saw two spots of light. “If you can create two spots, it seemed obvious to me that you could do a lot of spots and create images,” Greenberg said in a 2011 interview for an   Spectrum article . “We just needed to build a device.”</p><p>第二眼是从一道闪光开始的。1991年，罗伯特·格林伯格（Robert Greenberg）是一名电气工程师出身的医学生，他站在一间手术室里，看着一名视网膜外科医生将一根微小的电线插入一名失明患者的眼睛，这名患者当时醒着，处于局部麻醉状态。当电线接触到病人的视网膜并发出微小的电流时，该男子报告说，在他漆黑的视野中有一个光点。外科医生插入了第二根电线，这名男子看到了两个光点。格林伯格在2011年为Spectrum的一篇文章接受采访时说：“如果你能创建两个点，我觉得很明显，你可以创建很多点和图像。”。“我们只需要制造一台设备。”</p><p>  Of course, it wasn’t that easy. Greenberg spent many years developing the technology while working at the 	 Alfred Mann Foundation, a nonprofit organization that develops biomedical devices; he spun off the company Second Sight with three cofounders in 1998. The clinical trials of the first-generation Argus I (with a 16-electrode array) and the subsequent Argus II retinal implant (with a 60-pixel array) resulted in European regulatory approval in 2011 and U.S. approval in 2013.</p><p>当然，这没那么容易。格林伯格在开发艾尔弗雷德生物医学工程的非盈利组织——曼曼基金会工作了很多年。1998年，他与三位联合创始人剥离了该公司的Second Sight。第一代Argus I（具有16个电极阵列）和随后的Argus II视网膜植入物（具有60个像素阵列）的临床试验于2011年获得欧洲监管机构批准，2013年获得美国批准。</p><p>    The Argus II system consists of more than just the implant, which is surgically implanted in a procedure that takes about 4 hours. The user also wears special glasses outfitted with a small camera that sends video down a wire to a video processing unit (VPU), typically attached to the user’s belt.</p><p>Argus II系统不仅仅由植入物组成，植入物通过手术植入，需要大约4小时。用户还戴着配有小型摄像头的特殊眼镜，摄像头通过电线将视频发送到视频处理单元（VPU），视频处理单元通常连接在用户的腰带上。</p><p> The VPU reduces the images to patterns of 60 black-and-white pixels and sends them back to a transponder in the glasses, which beams them wirelessly to an antenna on the outside of the eye. From there, the signal goes to the 60-electrode array attached to the patient’s retina. The electrodes stimulate the eye in different patterns multiple times per second, creating flashes of light that correspond to the low-resolution video feed. Essentially, the electrodes take the place of the photoreceptor cells in a healthy eye that respond to light and send information up the optic nerve to the brain.</p><p>VPU将图像缩小为60个黑白像素的图案，并将其发送回眼镜中的应答器，应答器通过无线方式将图像发送到眼睛外侧的天线。从那里，信号传输到连接到患者视网膜的60电极阵列。电极每秒多次以不同的模式刺激眼睛，产生与低分辨率视频馈送相对应的闪光。基本上，电极取代了健康眼睛中的感光细胞，感光细胞对光线做出反应，并通过视神经向大脑发送信息。</p><p> Normal vision, this is not. Patients and doctors alike stress that the Argus II provides a kind of artificial vision, really a brand-new sense that people must learn how to use. Argus II users perceive shades of gray that appear and disappear as they move their heads. “This was the first of its kind, it was a fledgling technology,” Greenberg told 	 Spectrum in a recent interview. “We asked ourselves a lot: What’s good enough? There’s no doubt that it was very crude.” In its e-mailed statement, Second Sight says that most patients saw well enough to assist with basic locomotion.</p><p>正常视力，这不是。病人和医生都强调，Argus II提供了一种人工视觉，这是一种全新的感觉，人们必须学会如何使用。Argus II用户在移动头部时会看到灰色阴影的出现和消失。格林伯格在最近的一次采访中告诉Spectrum，“这是第一次，这是一项新兴技术。”。“我们问了自己很多问题：什么足够好？毫无疑问，它非常粗糙。”《第二视线》在其电子邮件声明中说，大多数患者的视力都足够好，可以帮助进行基本的运动。</p><p> But the company admits that the results varied. While some patients could make out the white stripes of a crosswalk against a dark road or the brightness of a face turned toward them, others struggled to see even basic patterns and shapes. Still, for many, it was worth it. Doerr remembers his attitude before the surgery: “Although it isn’t normal vision, it’s 100 percent better than what I have now.”</p><p>但该公司承认，结果各不相同。虽然一些患者可以辨认出人行横道上的白色条纹和黑暗的道路，或者脸转向他们时的亮度，但其他人甚至难以看到基本的图案和形状。然而，对许多人来说，这是值得的。多尔记得自己在手术前的态度：“虽然视力不正常，但比我现在的视力好100%。”</p><p> Jeroen Perk, who lives in the Netherlands, lost his sight almost completely by the age of 19. In 2013, at the age of 36, Perk became one of the youngest people to receive an Argus II. He was a success story: Within just a couple of years, Perk was shown in Second Sight videos 	 skiing and  shooting arrows.</p><p>住在荷兰的杰伦·珀克在19岁时几乎完全失明。2013年，36岁的珀克成为接受阿古斯II的最年轻的人之一。他是一个成功的故事：短短几年内，Perk就出现在了滑雪和射箭的二视视频中。</p><p>  Lucian Del Priore was one of the physicians involved in the clinical trials; he did the implantation for Barbara Campbell while at NewYork-Presbyterian, in New York City. He remembers the excitement when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Argus II technology for people with a genetic condition called  retinitis pigmentosa, and notes that there were no other options for such patients.</p><p>Lucian Del Priore是参与临床试验的医生之一；他在纽约市纽约长老会为芭芭拉·坎贝尔做植入手术。他还记得美国食品和药物管理局批准Argus II技术用于患有色素性视网膜炎的遗传病患者时的激动心情，并指出，这类患者没有其他选择。</p><p>  “These people were completely in the dark,” he says. “They couldn’t tell the difference between a bright day at the beach and being in a coal mine in Pittsburgh. The idea that they were getting some kind of vision, it was kind of electrifying—for the patients and the doctors.”</p><p>“这些人完全处于黑暗之中，”他说。“他们分不清在海滩上晴朗的一天和在匹兹堡的煤矿里有什么区别。他们获得了某种视力的想法，这对病人和医生来说是一种兴奋。”</p><p> While the Argus II was technically impressive, it faced financial headwinds. Second Sight was selling the Argus II for around $150,000 in the United States—about five times as much as other neuromodulation devices, according to Greenberg. But even so, he says, the company was losing money: “With all the overhead of sales and regulatory people, it wasn’t profitable.”</p><p>虽然Argus II在技术上令人印象深刻，但它面临着财务上的阻力。据格林伯格介绍，Second Sight在美国的售价约为15万美元，是其他神经调节设备的五倍。但即便如此，他说，该公司仍在亏损：“由于销售和监管人员的管理费用，它没有盈利。”</p><p> Moreover, implanting the Argus II was just the start of a long, tough journey for patients. Second Sight employed its own vision-rehabilitation specialists to work one-on-one with implantees, often for months or years. One Argus II patient estimated that the total cost of the device, surgery, and rehabilitation was $497,000. Typically, at least 80 percent of the device fee and most of the other costs were covered by insurance.</p><p>此外，植入Argus II只是患者漫长而艰难旅程的开始。Second Sight聘请了自己的视力康复专家与植入物进行一对一的治疗，通常长达数月或数年。一名Argus II患者估计，该设备、手术和康复的总成本为49.7万美元。通常情况下，至少80%的设备费用和大部分其他费用由保险支付。</p><p>  A positive outcome was far from certain. Although Linda Kirk was the subject of an 	 optimistic news story on receiving her Argus II in New York in 2017, she found the implant more distracting than enabling. “I really wanted to be able to tell them, this is great; it’s a success. And I couldn’t do that,” she tells  Spectrum. Kirk stopped using the device a couple of years later.</p><p>积极的结果还远未确定。尽管琳达·柯克（Linda Kirk）在2017年于纽约接受Argus II时成为了一则乐观新闻的主题，但她发现植入物更让人分心，而不是让人兴奋。她告诉Spectrum：“我真的很想告诉他们，这很好；这是一个成功。但我做不到。”。几年后，柯克停止使用该设备。</p><p> At the nonprofit 	 Lighthouse International, a senior fellow in vision science named  Aries Arditi was a principal investigator for the Argus II clinical trial. Arditi says his experiences with patients slowly soured him on the technology. He tells  Spectrum that in his decades of work with people who were born sighted and later lost their vision, he’s learned that “they often develop a desperate hope for something that will help and are willing to try anything.” Arditi feels that Second Sight promised more than it delivered. “I found it very disturbing that [Second Sight] sold so many of these devices to patients who were relying on hope rather than proven performance.”</p><p>在非营利组织Lighthouse International，视觉科学高级研究员Aries Arditi是Argus II临床试验的主要研究者。阿迪蒂说，他与病人相处的经历慢慢让他对这项技术感到不满。他告诉Spectrum，在他几十年来与那些天生有视力但后来失去视力的人合作的过程中，他了解到“他们往往对一些有帮助的东西抱有绝望的希望，并且愿意尝试任何事情。”阿迪蒂觉得第二次视力带来的希望比它带来的更多。“我发现非常令人不安的是，[第二视觉]向依赖希望而不是可靠性能的患者销售了这么多此类设备。”</p><p> Arditi also says that he did a research study including nearly all the U.S. participants in the Argus II clinical trial that showed “weakness” with the device’s vision quality. He says Second Sight wouldn’t let him publish or present the results; the company says it disagreed with his analysis and discouraged him from publishing.</p><p>阿迪蒂还说，他做了一项研究，包括几乎所有参与Argus II临床试验的美国参与者，该试验显示，该设备的视觉质量存在“弱点”。他说，“第二视觉”不允许他发表或展示研究结果；该公司表示不同意他的分析，并阻止他发表文章。</p><p> Barbara Campbell, who received her implant during the clinical trial of the Argus II, did find the bionic vision system useful. As a New York City resident, she used it outside on the busy sidewalks and while taking a subway or bus. “The more I used it, the benefits increased,” she remembers. “I think I was retraining my brain to see stuff.” But in 2013, after four years of regular use, Campbell’s system shut down in the subway station, and despite some repair attempts by Second Sight, never worked again. While she talked with her doctors about having the implant removed, she ultimately decided that the risks of another surgery weren’t worth it. She still has the defunct technology in her left eye.</p><p>芭芭拉·坎贝尔（Barbara Campbell）在Argus II的临床试验中接受了植入物，她确实发现仿生视觉系统很有用。作为一名纽约市居民，她在外面繁忙的人行道上以及乘地铁或公交车时使用它。“我用得越多，好处就越大，”她回忆道。“我想我是在重新训练我的大脑去看东西。”但在2013年，经过四年的正常使用后，坎贝尔的系统在地铁站关闭了，尽管有一些第二眼力的修复尝试，但再也无法工作。当她与医生讨论移除植入物的问题时，她最终决定不值得再做一次手术。她的左眼里仍然有已经不存在的技术。</p><p> Simply not working isn’t the worst thing that could happen — there ’ s also the possibility of medical problems.  Second Sight conducted an FDA-mandated  postapproval study of the Argus II, following 30 patients from 2007 to 2019. Over that time, 36 serious and 152 nonserious “adverse events” were observed. The FDA did not make the study’s final report available to   Spectrum , and a Freedom of Information Act request filed in May 2021 has yet to be fulfilled.</p><p>根本不工作并不是可能发生的最糟糕的事情——还有可能出现医疗问题。Second Sight在2007年至2019年间追踪了30名患者，对Argus II进行了FDA授权的批准后研究。在这段时间里，观察到36起严重和152起非严重的“不良事件”。FDA没有将这项研究的最终报告提供给频谱，而2021年5月提交的信息自由法案要求尚未完成。</p><p> However, the FDA also maintains a public database called Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, or 	 MAUDE, where manufacturers are required (and health care professionals and patients are encouraged) to submit reports of serious adverse events.</p><p>然而，FDA还维护一个名为“制造商和用户设施设备体验”（Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience，简称MAUDE）的公共数据库，要求制造商（以及鼓励医疗保健专业人员和患者）提交严重不良事件的报告。</p><p> Spectrum analyzed all 90 MAUDE reports for the Argus II, submitted from 2014 to 2020. These reports are unverified and could be duplicate, biased, inaccurate, or incomplete, warns the FDA. While some described inflammation, infection, or pain that could be managed with medication, nearly 80 percent reported a surgical intervention. The reasons for surgery included hemorrhages, low eye pressure and, in about 15 percent of cases, detached retinas.</p><p>Spectrum分析了2014年至2020年间提交的所有90份莫德报告。FDA警告称，这些报告未经证实，可能重复、有偏见、不准确或不完整。虽然一些人描述了可以通过药物治疗的炎症、感染或疼痛，但近80%的人报告了手术干预。手术原因包括出血、低眼压，约15%的病例视网膜脱离。</p><p> To be sure, such outcomes were not very common. Data from 2017 (	 published in 2020) showed that 83 percent of 244 postapproval patients had experienced no serious events after two years.</p><p>平心而论，这样的结果并不常见。2017年（2020年发布）的数据显示，244名审批后患者中有83%在两年后没有发生严重事件。</p><p>  Terry Byland did not encounter any problems with his 2004 Argus I implant. In fact, when Second Sight offered him the Argus II, he was eager to try it. “Once you get a taste of being able to see certain things again, you want to continue on and make it better,” he tells  Spectrum. By June 2015, Byland was the only person on the planet with two bionic eyes.</p><p>Terry Byland在2004年的Argus I植入手术中没有遇到任何问题。事实上，当“第二视线”向他提供阿古斯二世时，他急于尝试。他告诉Spectrum：“一旦你尝到了再次看到某些东西的滋味，你就想继续下去，让它变得更好。”。到2015年6月，比兰德成为地球上唯一拥有两只仿生眼睛的人。</p><p> The jump from the Argus I’s 16 electrodes to 60 in the newer technology improved Byland’s vision, and it seemed like more advances were just around the corner. During a series of tests at the University of Southern California and Second Sight in 2016 and 2017, Byland was told about “virtual electrodes,” that is, software upgrades that would boost his system fourfold to around 250 pixels, as well as a new video processing unit. “I was sold,” he says. “I felt like we were on the verge of really making a big breakthrough.”</p><p>在较新的技术中，从Argus I的16个电极跳到60个，提高了Byland的视力，而且似乎更多的进步就在眼前。在南加州大学的一系列测试和2016和2017的第二次实验中，拜伦被告知“虚拟电极”，也就是说，软件升级将把他的系统提高四倍到大约250像素，以及一个新的视频处理单元。“我被出卖了，”他说。“我觉得我们即将取得重大突破。”</p><p> Other Argus II patients 	 Spectrum spoke with were also told they would be getting upgrades, such as a digital camera, thermal imaging, and even facial recognition software. In 2016, a USC professor even  raised the possibility of color vision.</p><p>与Spectrum交谈的其他Argus II患者也被告知他们将获得升级，例如数码相机、热成像，甚至面部识别软件。2016年，南加州大学的一位教授甚至提出了色觉的可能性。</p><p> By 2018, Byland’s impressions had shifted. Second Sight continued to ask him to do promotional visits, but testing had slacked off—and there was no sign of any new technology. “It just felt like maybe somebody there wasn&#39;t being completely honest with me,” he says.</p><p>到2018年，比兰德的印象发生了变化。Second Sight继续要求他进行宣传访问，但测试已经放缓，没有任何新技术的迹象。“我只是觉得那里可能有人&#39；对我不完全诚实，”他说。</p><p> Company cofounder  Greenberg says Second Sight’s long-term plan was always to pivot to a brain implant that would bypass the eye altogether and directly stimulate the visual cortex. A neural device could help more people with vision problems, even those who weren’t eligible for an Argus II implant because of severe damage to the retina or optic nerve. But Greenberg wasn’t able to steer the company through that transition.</p><p>该公司的联合创始人格林伯格说，Second Sight的长期计划一直是转向一种大脑植入物，这种植入物将完全绕过眼睛，直接刺激视觉皮层。神经装置可以帮助更多有视力问题的人，即使是那些因为视网膜或视神经严重受损而不符合Argus II植入条件的人。但格林伯格没能引导公司完成这一转变。</p><p> Greenberg’s relationship with Second Sight’s investors had been worsening over the years; he stepped down as CEO in 2015 and then 	 left the board of directors in 2018, a move that he has characterized as a  forced departure but that he declined to discuss with  Spectrum because of a non disclosure agreement (NDA).</p><p>格林伯格与Second Sight投资者的关系多年来一直在恶化；他于2015年辞去首席执行官一职，然后于2018年离开董事会，他称此举是被迫离职，但由于保密协议（NDA），他拒绝与Spectrum讨论此事。</p><p> On 18 July 2019, Second Sight sent Argus patients a letter saying it would be phasing out the retinal implant technology to clear the way for the development of its next-generation brain implant for blindness, Orion, which had begun a clinical trial with six patients the previous year. The U.S. National Institutes of Health is funding that trial as a 	 $6.4 million project over five years.</p><p>2019年7月18日，Second Sight向Argus患者发送了一封信，表示将逐步淘汰视网膜植入技术，为其下一代盲人大脑植入物Orion的开发扫清道路。Orion在前一年开始了一项针对六名患者的临床试验。美国国立卫生研究院（U.S.National Institutes of Health）正在资助该试验，作为一个为期五年、耗资640万美元的项目。</p><p> “The leadership at the time didn’t believe they could make [the Argus] part of the business profitable,” Greenberg says. “I understood the decision, because I think the size of the market turned out to be smaller than we had thought.”</p><p>格林伯格说：“当时的领导层不相信他们能让（阿古斯）的部分业务盈利。”。“我理解这个决定，因为我认为市场规模比我们想象的要小。”</p><p> Second Sight was quick to assure Argus patients that its support of their retinal devices would not change. “Second Sight will be maintaining a full team of Customer Care and Vision Rehab Specialists accessible to you as we have in the past,” read the letter. “In addition, we have taken all measures to ensure the ongoing supply needs for your device.”</p><p>Second Sight迅速向Argus患者保证其对视网膜设备的支持不会改变。信中写道：“Second Sight将维持一个完整的客户护理和视力康复专家团队，就像我们过去所做的那样。”。“此外，我们已采取一切措施，确保您的设备的持续供应需求。”</p><p> However, the letter’s promises were already looking shaky, according to one ex-engineer at the company, who asked not to be named because they had also signed an NDA. “We didn’t really support the basic Argus after that,” the engineer tells  Spectrum. “We didn’t sell any more, we didn’t make any more, we didn’t have anything to do with it anymore.”</p><p>然而，该公司的一位前工程师表示，这封信的承诺看起来已经摇摇欲坠，他要求不具名，因为他们还签署了保密协议。“在那之后，我们并没有真正支持基本的Argus，”这位工程师告诉Spectrum。“我们再也卖不出去了，再也赚不到钱了，我们和它没有任何关系了。”</p><p>  In February 2020, the senior director of implant R&amp;D left the company, swiftly followed by its CEO. On 30 March, Second Sight laid off the majority of its remaining employees and announced its “	 intention to wind down operations,” citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its ability to secure financing. Within weeks, most of its physical assets—including manufacturing equipment, scientific instruments, laptops, and shelving—went up for sale at  auction.</p><p>2020年2月，植入研发部高级总监；D离开了公司，紧接着是公司的首席执行官。3月30日，第二2019冠状病毒疾病裁员，宣布了“减少运营的打算”，理由是COVID-19流行病对其融资能力的影响。几周内，它的大部分实物资产，包括制造设备、科学仪器、笔记本电脑和货架，都在拍卖会上出售。</p><p>  Second Sight didn’t inform any of its patients of the company’s collapse. “No letter, email, or telephone call,” Ross Doerr wrote on Facebook after weeks of fruitlessly trying to contact the company. “Those of us with this implant are figuratively and literally in the dark.”</p><p>Second Sight没有告知任何患者公司倒闭的消息。“没有信件、电子邮件或电话，”罗斯·多尔（Ross Doerr）在Facebook上写道，此前几周，他一直试图联系该公司，但都没有结果。“我们这些植入物的人都是在暗中进行的。”</p><p> The implications of Second Sight’s implosion would soon strike home for Doerr. While using the Argus II for more than a few hours had always caused him to feel a little dizzy—a well-known side effect—early in 2020 he started to experience severe vertigo.</p><p>“第二视线”内爆的影响很快就会让多尔明白。虽然使用Argus II超过几个小时总是让他感到有点头晕——这是一种众所周知的副作用，但在2020年初，他开始出现严重的眩晕。</p><p> Doerr’s doctor scheduled an MRI scan to rule out a brain-stem tumor. But because an MRI’s intense magnetic fields can interact with the Argus II, MRI providers are instructed to contact Second Sight before performing any scans—and Second Sight wasn’t picking up the phone. Doerr eventually got a CT scan instead, which found nothing. “I still don’t know if I have a brain-stem tumor or not,” he tells 	 Spectrum.</p><p>多尔的医生安排了核磁共振扫描以排除脑干肿瘤。但由于核磁共振成像的强磁场可以与Argus II互动，核磁共振成像供应商被指示在进行任何扫描之前联系Second Sight，Second Sight没有拿起手机。多尔最终接受了CT扫描，结果什么也没发现。“我仍然不知道自己是否患有脑干肿瘤，”他告诉Spectrum。</p><p> Jeroen Perk also suffered from the transition. A regular user of the Argus II for up to 9 hours a day, Perk was using the system in November 2020 when the video processing unit (VPU) fell from his belt to the ground and shattered. “I had no vision, no Argus, and no support from Second Sight,” he remembers.</p><p>杰伦·珀克也受到了转型的影响。Perk是Argus II的常客，每天使用时间长达9小时。2020年11月，Perk在使用该系统时，视频处理单元（VPU）从腰带上掉到地上，摔碎了。“我没有视力，没有阿古斯，也没有第二眼力的支持，”他回忆道。</p><p> For a week Perk considered his options, including having the device removed from his retina. “My conclusion was, I must have [my vision] back,” he says. Perk shared his situation with the Argus II community in Europe, asking if anyone had spare parts. He quickly heard back from a patient who was no longer using the device and from a doctor with a spare VPU. By February 2021, he had a refurbished system, and Perk is now happily using it.</p><p>珀克考虑了一周的选择，包括从视网膜上移除设备。“我的结论是，我必须找回（我的愿景），”他说。Perk与欧洲的Argus II社区分享了他的情况，询问是否有人有备件。他很快收到了一位不再使用该设备的患者和一位配备备用VPU的医生的回复。到2021年2月，他有一个翻新系统，珀克现在很高兴地使用它。</p><p>  “It is a pity that the Argus is not going any further,” he says. “But I’m a lucky bastard. I never have any regrets about doing this.”</p><p>“很遗憾，阿古斯号没有再前进了，”他说。“但我是个幸运的混蛋。我对这样做从不后悔。”</p><p> In its statement to 	 Spectrum, Second Sight says that during its financial difficulties, its reduced workforce “was unable to continue the previous level of support and communication for Argus II centers and users.” After  Spectrum contacted Second Sight, the company sent letters to Argus clinicians and users stating, “we will do our best to provide virtual support” to physicians and that it has a limited supply of VPUs and glasses for replacements. No repairs or replacements are possible, however, for the implants themse</p><p>在对Spectrum的声明中，Second Sight表示，在财政困难期间，其减少的劳动力“无法继续为Argus II中心和用户提供先前水平的支持和沟通”Spectrum联系Second Sight后，该公司致信Argus临床医生和用户，表示“我们将尽最大努力为医生提供虚拟支持”，并且其VPU和替代眼镜的供应有限。然而，植入物本身不可能进行修复或更换</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sight/">#sight</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/patients/">#patients</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
