Now, I see that Matt Clancy (whose  blog on the economics of innovation you should definitely check out) is  starting an Econ Twitter book club with a recommendation from my list!\n  Meanwhile, a few friends in the tech industry asked me for sci-fi recommendations the other day, and I told them I\u2019d send them this list!\n Anyway, here it is. 2013 was a long time ago, and I\u2019ve read a lot of sci-fi since then, so I plan to go through and make additions to the list in the future. In the meantime I added a couple of especially good ones at the end.\n  Really, most science fiction is about economics. What makes most future visions interesting is not just the technical particulars of the cool new Stuff, but the social ramifications. Here are some of the sci-fi books that I thought dealt with important economic issues in the most insightful and interesting ways. I also chose only books that I think are well-written, with well-conceived characters, engaging plots, and skillful writing.   1.\u00a0   A Deepness in the Sky , by Vernor Vinge  In addition to being quite possibly the best science fiction novel I&#39;ve ever read,\u00a0 Deepness\u00a0is also a great meditation on public economics. When Vernor Vinge became famous in the 80s, he was a hard-core libertarian - his novel\u00a0  The Peace War, and its sequel short story &#34;The Ungoverned&#34;, are\u00a0like a Real Business Cycle model come to life, with lone-wolf genius engineers teaming up with private police forces to bring down a fascist technocratic government made up of...university administrators. Ha. But by the 90s, Vinge&#39;s views on government and markets had become markedly more nuanced - in the swashbuckling space opera\u00a0  A Fire Upon the Deep, we see private security forces failing miserably when faced with a powerful external threat (in fact, that book made me think of the &#34; Tamerlane Principle&#34;). Security, Vinge realizes, is a public good.  In\u00a0 Deepness, Vinge adds another public good: Research. The narrative of\u00a0 Deepness\u00a0is split between a race of spider-people with roughly 20th-century technology, and a spacefaring guild of human merchants called the Qeng Ho. On the spider world, the protagonist is a brilliant scientist named Sherkaner Underhill, who is basically a Von Neumann or Feynman type. Sherkaner is the ultimate lone genius, but he ends up needing the government to fund his research. In space, meanwhile, the heroic merchant entrepreneur Pham Nuwen (who is a recurring protagonist in Vinge novels) struggles to decide whether he should turn his merchant fleet into an interstellar government. Governments, he finds, are good at producing really new scientific breakthroughs, but eventually they become unwieldy and stifle the economy and society, then collapse under their own institutional weight. The very very end of the book is - or at least, seemed to me to be - a metaphor for the Great Stagnation and the death (and future rebirth) of Big Science.   2.\u00a0   Makers , by Cory Doctorow  Cory Doctorow is known both for his science fiction and for being the creator of the blog\u00a0  Boing Boing, one of the oldest and best blogs on the internet. In\u00a0 Makers, Doctorow dishes up a near future that is almost spooky in its prophetic vision. The book is all about economics, the death of corporations, the rise of freelance and temp economies, the death of old media and the rise of blogs, and the disruptive impact of technology on people&#39;s jobs. It envisions the rise of 3D printing, the startup craze (and the startup glut), and the use of intellectual property as corporations&#39; weapon of choice to fight back against progress. It&#39;s incredibly well-written, but also extremely sad, just to warn you.   3.\u00a0   The Dispossessed , by Ursula K. LeGuin  It&#39;s incredibly hard to imagine a world without private property, but LeGuin pulls it off. Spoilers: A world without property is pretty boring and fairly poor. But LeGuin also shows us another world, much like our own, where the anti-property anarcho-syndicalist movement was suppressed and tamed, much like Marxism was suppressed and tamed here on Earth. What&#39;s interesting is that although anarcho-syndicalism doesn&#39;t work incredibly well on the world where it&#39;s implemented, the anarcho-syndicalist\u00a0 idea\u00a0and\u00a0 movement\u00a0serve as a sort of permanent opposition force on the capitalist world. When\u00a0 I read Robert M. Buckley\u00a0writing that Marxism has fulfilled a similar role in the West here on Earth, I immediately thought of\u00a0 The Dispossessed.   4.\u00a0   Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom , by Cory Doctorow  Doctorow again. In this book, he examines what a true post-scarcity society would look like. Spoiler: It looks a lot like a bunch of sarcastic bohemian Canadian people. But basically, I think that&#39;s probably what the future\u00a0 will\u00a0look like, at least if we&#39;re lucky. Anyway, this book is notable for the concept of &#34;whuffie&#34;, an online currency based on peer approval, which arguably inspired Facebook&#39;s &#34;like&#34; button.   5.\u00a0   Rainbows End , by Vernor Vinge  Vinge again.\u00a0 Rainbows End\u00a0is a sad, thoughtful novel about old age and obsolescence (notice that there is no apostrophe in the title). But it&#39;s also one of the most visionary novels about future labor markets. In an interconnected world in which skills never stay fresh for long and most value is created through entertainment, old engineers have to go back to high school, and new corporations are started by teenagers collaborating online with strangers halfway around the world.\u00a0 Rainbows End\u00a0is also famous for envisioning the technology of Augmented Reality; this novel probably inspired Google Glass. Interestingly, Vinge continues his evolution toward a balanced view of public goods, adding education to the list of things that government needs to provide. (Update: In an email, Vinge points out that he never specified that the high school in\u00a0 Rainbows End\u00a0was government-funded! Touche!)   6.\u00a0   Accelerando , by Charles Stross  Charles Stross, another\u00a0 noted blogger, loves to play with ideas, even if he doesn&#39;t believe in them. In\u00a0 Accelerando, he mainly plays with the idea of the Singularity, but he also plays with a bunch of far-out funky future economics. In one part, the main character, impresario and wandering entrepreneur Manfred Macx, uses advanced computer algorithms to successfully implement an optimal centrally planned economy, by predicting what humans will want before they even know they want it. Macx&#39;s various disruptive innovations inevitably draw the ire of the law, and he creates a protective cloud of AI lawyers to wage constant &#34;lawfare&#34; against governments and corporations alike. In another part of the book, the entire solar system is taken over by sentient High-Frequency Trading algorithms. But I haven&#39;t really spoiled the book for you, since these are only about 0.1% of the ideas contained within. Note: Stross has also written a series called the\u00a0 Merchant Princes\u00a0series that deals even more with economics, but I haven&#39;t read it.   7.\u00a0   Lucifer&#39;s Hammer , by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle   Lucifer&#39;s Hammer\u00a0is a story about a comet hitting Earth, and the aftermath. It&#39;s notable for its quaint Reaganite conservative politics (it came out in 1977), and does make a couple of glaring economic mistakes (for example, a guy trying to build a nuclear power plant is an independent wildcatting entrepreneur instead of a giant government-backed corporation). But it makes up for that with its excellent portrayal of what the economy would be like in the immediate aftermath of an abrupt civilizational collapse. Hint: Farming, containment of contagious diseases, de-specialization of labor, and collective security become very very important.   8.\u00a0   The Windup Girl , by Paolo Bacigalupi  Brutally dark and hopeless,\u00a0 The Windup Girl\u00a0is a book about peak oil, global civilizational decline, and the (temporary) end of positive-sum economies. In a suddenly overpopulated world, humans are forced into a constant Hobbesian zero-sum game, and most moral norms go right out the window. Warning: This is very tough book to read. But it serves as an important reminder of the Malthusian menace that forever lurks just outside the circle of light provided by the flickering candle-flame of modern technology.   9.\u00a0   The Moon is a Harsh Mistress , by Robert Heinlein  Actually a mythic retelling of the American Revolution,\u00a0 The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\u00a0contains some very interesting thoughts on colonialism and the Resource Curse. Unsurprisingly, terrorism is used as a way to make resource colonialism too expensive for the occupying power. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t get to see the political struggles and despotic regimes that probably arose in the aftermath of lunar independence. But Heinlein also does use the book to play with some interesting libertarian ideas, like a privatized court system.   10.\u00a0   Schismatrix , by Bruce Sterling  Simply one of the most wide-ranging and visionary science fiction novels ever written. Bruce Sterling is like an eternally erupting quasar of creativity, and this is his finest book. None of the economics here makes any sense - or, more accurately, it all takes place in such a funky, crazy future world that it&#39;s impossible to know if it makes any sense.   11.\u00a0   Permutation City , by Greg Egan  If there&#39;s any sci-fi novel that beats\u00a0 Schismatrix\u00a0for far-out blow-your-brain-out-the-back-of-your-skull vision, it&#39;s\u00a0 Permutation City. If I hadn&#39;t already had the idea for\u00a0 D-Mod, this book (written over a decade before I thought of the concept) would have given it to me fully formed.\u00a0 Permutation City\u00a0is about the ultimate nature and purpose of human consciousness and experience, and yet it has implications for technologies that are being developed right now, as we speak.   12.\u00a0   Reamde , by Neal Stephenson  Most people would recommend Stephenson&#39;s\u00a0 Snow Crash\u00a0or\u00a0 Cryptonomicon, but for economics I like\u00a0 Reamde\u00a0the best. Although not technically sci-fi, it has that flavor. The hero is an aging tech entrepreneur who owns a game that&#39;s a combination of World of Warcraft and Bitcoin (yes, this book predicts Bitcoin). It also deals with the economic incentives of the Russian mob, the challenges facing smart young tech workers in China and Hungary, and lots of other cool features of today&#39;s global economy. It&#39;s not Stephenson&#39;s #1 awesomest book, though; that would be\u00a0  Anathem.   13.\u00a0 The\u00a0   Game of Thrones  \u00a0series, by George R.R. Martin\n Actually, I lied earlier...the person who requested a &#34;Sci-fi for economists&#34; list also asked me to include fantasy. But the\u00a0 Game of Thrones\u00a0books (actually called A Song of Ice and Fire, though few use that name anymore) are really the only fantasy novels I can think of that deal with economics in an interesting way. You get to see a lot of the messed-up economies of medieval times, including feudalism, slavery, anarchy, blood sport, and the difficulty of international trade with poor information and unreliable transportation.   14.\u00a0   The Year of the Flood , by Margaret Atwood   The Year of the Flood\u00a0is the companion novel to\u00a0  Oryx and Crake, a philosophical dystopia/apocalypse novel (and one of the best such novels ever written, IMHO). But you can read\u00a0 The Year of the Flood\u00a0on its own. This book is, basically, about a market dystopia. Everything is for sale in this future, and yet negative externalities, asymmetric information, and weak institutions make the world a nightmare.   15.\u00a0   When Gravity Fails , by George Alec Effinger  This is basically a novel about underground economies and organized crime. Interesting for those who like to think about the economics of such things. Also, an extremely well-written and fun book.   16.\u00a0   Stand on Zanzibar , by John Bruenner   Stand on Zanzibar\u00a0is a little dated, but it really picks up on a lot of economic trends that were just starting in the 60s (e.g. the pricing of previously plentiful commodities such as water). The economics are all about the effects of overpopulation, which seems less menacing in the 2010s, but is still a major problem in parts of the world. A great futurist novel from the past.\n  I\u2019m proud to say I consulted a bit on the econ ideas for this book! I helped come up with the idea that sentient robots begin their lives as indentured servants (in order to cover their capital costs of production). But that\u2019s just one of many super-interesting ideas in this book, which is very focused on the economics of the future biotech industry. It\u2019s also a very fun read.\n  I attempted to consult on this one as well, but was utterly bamboozled by the idea of a city where there\u2019s a different currency for each type of good you might want to purchase, and the only way to exchange the currencies is at illegal underground exchanges! It\u2019s an utterly insane system, but it turns out that that\u2019s the whole point. In fact, the system slightly anticipates the world of crypto, where corporate tokens can be used to buy specific products (but thankfully, crypto has Ether and various exchanges to make sense of the system, so it works better than the one in the book!). Anyway,  The City in the Middle of the Night is an awesome novel, and you should read it.  Note: Still no\u00a0 Foundation\u00a0series. I love the\u00a0 Foundation\u00a0series, and it&#39;s really fun, but the economics are crappy (agglomeration economies encourage the collapse of empires?). And more importantly, the whole conceit of psychohistory is very dangerous for economists; our models will never forecast that well, the Universe is stochastic rather than deterministic, and we should avoid the temptation for intellectual hubris. \u00a0Foundation is social science&#39;s &#34;physics envy&#34; writ large. We are not, and will never be, Hari Seldon, so\u00a0 Foundation, classic as it is, doesn&#39;t go on my list!\n Anyway, there&#39;s my list. I haven&#39;t read everything out there, obviously. But if you&#39;re in the econ field and you want to think big deep thoughts about economics under different technological and social conditions, these books are for you. They&#39;re also a lot of fun.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 07:28:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Thanks to a twist of fate, two large cups of coffee and help from editor Annie Saunders, the Extra Crunch team is taking over today\u2019s edition of Daily Crunch.\n Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll hand it back as soon as Henry Pickavet returns or Alex Wilhelm is back from vacation, whichever occurs first.\n Since I\u2019ve been handed the mic: We\u2019re trying to identify the most effective growth marketers who are helping startups build their businesses. With that in mind, Managing Editor Eric Eldon  interviewed growth leader Susan Su, currently head of portfolio strategy at Sound Ventures, about the need for founders to develop a growth-centered mentality as the economy reopens.\n \u201cThey don\u2019t need to memorize all the right buttons to push in an ads dashboard, but they need to be familiar and comfortable with the core work of gap-finding,\u201d says Su.\n \u201cFounders will fail if they adopt a mentality that someone else can or should do it for them. The founder\u2019s job is to supply ambition and opinions, and then magnetize high-quality talent to come and pull the levers and bring their creative vision to life.\u201d\n If you\u2019ve worked with a growth expert you recommend,  please get in touch and let us know.\n      Apple doesn\u2019t rank with top personal health brands like Procter &amp; Gamble, Peloton or Fitbit, but perhaps it doesn\u2019t need to. Cupertino\u2019s health-related products and services are broad enough to touch each of these companies \u2014 and many others \u2014 in some way.\n In   an interview with Apple VP of Technology Kevin Lynch, Darrell Etherington tracked the evolution of the company\u2019s user-guided approach to developing hardware, software and data management policies around personal health.\n \u201cIt actually started from Apple Watch, where we were capturing heart rate data for calorimetry activity, and [Activity] ring closure, and we needed a place to put the heart rate data,\u201d says Lynch. \u201cSo we created the Health app as a place to store the data.\u201d\n Sarah Perez reported on   today\u2019s launch of Spotify Greenroom, a live audio app based on the code of Locker Room. In March, Spotify purchased Betty Labs, which developed Locker Room.\n Best known for music streaming, Spotify has been branching out into a more robust media company in recent years. Greenroom will allow users to host and join audio chat rooms, \u201cand optionally turn those conversations into podcasts,\u201d says Sarah.\n There\u2019s a reason why advertising units are called \u201cimpressions.\u201d CPG companies are eager to literally place their messages in our faces.\n So it should come as no surprise that   Facebook today announced its plans to start testing ads on its Oculus platform in a limited rollout. A company blog post indicates that \u201cfor now, this is a test with a few apps.\u201d\n  Software testing platform BrowserStack announced today that it has raised $200 million in a Series B round. The round, which values the company at $4 billion, was led by BOND, with Insight Partners and Accel participating.\n PandaDoc competitor Templafy has raised a Series D worth $60 million. Since launch, the business document creation platform based in Denmark has raised $125 million, including a $25 million Series C 14 months ago.\n After securing a $100 million Series E round led by Accel partners,   last-mile delivery platform Bringg is now valued at $1 billion, the company confirms. CEO Guy Bloch told TechCrunch the funds will be used to continue fueling growth, expanding operations and acquiring new customers. \u201cCompanies need our urgent help to do a job,\u201d says Bloch.\n  The prevailing post-pandemic edtech narrative, which predicted higher ed would be DOA as soon as everyone got their vaccine and took off for a gap year, might not be quite true.\n Natasha Mascarenhas explores a new crop of edtech SaaS startups that function like guidance counselors, helping students with everything from study-abroad opportunities to swiping right on a captivating college (really!).\n \u201cStartups that help students navigate institutional bureaucracy so they can get more value out of their educational experience may become a growing focus for investors as consumer demand for virtual personalized learning increases,\u201d she writes.\n  (Extra Crunch is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.   You can sign up here .)\n  Facebook rolls out new tools for Group admins : Facebook launched a new set of tools aimed at helping Facebook Group administrators get a better handle on their online communities and, potentially, help keep conversations from going off the rails. (May the odds be ever in your favor!) Among the more interesting new tools is a machine-learning-powered feature that alerts admins to potentially unhealthy conversations taking place in their group. Another lets the admin slow the pace of a heated conversation by limiting how often group members can post. As the adage goes, if you can\u2019t say anything nice, say it slower.\n Google updates online safety curriculum for kids : Perhaps we can teach the next generation to just be nice on the internet instead of using machine learning to prevent them from rapidly disseminating vaccine disinformation? Google updated and expanded its digital safety and citizenship curriculum, Be Internet Awesome, which has lessons for parents and educators about online gaming, cyberbullying and online empathy. Fingers crossed!\n Waymo, Alphabet\u2019s self-driving arm, raises $2.5B : In its second outside funding round, Waymo raised $2.5 billion to grow Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving platform, and its team.

Multiple  reports have found organized efforts to spam the store with meaningless 5-star reviews in exchange for free products or cash. I have myself received such offers, or sellers promising payment for raising a star rating.\n After the requisite preliminary palaver about being \u201cobsessed with delighting customers\u201d and all that, Amazon explains that it, like all big tech giants, uses automated systems to vet reviews before they go up. The company has always been cagey about the actual numbers, but in this post it drops a whopper: \u201cIn 2020, we stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer.\u201d\n  200 million is a lot no matter how you look at it, but it\u2019s really a lot when you consider that Amazon  told CNBC that same year that it \u201canalyze[s] over 10 million review submissions weekly,\u201d which adds up to somewhere north of 520 million submissions yearly. These two Amazon-provided numbers suggest that a third of all reviews submitted, at a minimum, are rejected as fake.\n Hard numbers on Amazon\u2019s total reviews are hard to come by.  Speaking to Buzzfeed, Amazon listing analysis site ReviewMeta\u2019s Tommy Noonan estimated that in 2020 Amazon hosted around 250 million reviews (of which, incidentally, he calculated about 9 percent were \u201cunnatural\u201d). But if over 500 million were submitted in 2020 and about 200 million of those were fake, that indicates a far larger total. I\u2019ve asked Amazon for more precise information on this, and will update the post if I hear back, but the company is not communicative about these numbers in general.\n Groups organizing on social media numbering in the tens of thousands have been repeatedly pointed out as major contributors to the fake review ecosystem. Amazon writes that in the first quarter of 2020, it reported 300 such groups to the platforms hosting them, and the same period in 2021 it reported over 1,000. Takedown times have increased, but it\u2019s hard to take this increase as anything other than a thriving business model \u2014 certainly not something in the process of being stamped out.\n  \u201cIt is imperative for social media companies to invest adequately in proactive controls to detect and enforce fake reviews ahead of our reporting the issue to them,\u201d Amazon declares. Indeed social media companies are being pressed from multiple directions to  take more responsibility for what users do on their platforms, but they make the same noises Amazon does: \u201cwe\u2019re doing what we can,\u201d (and, it is left unsaid, clearly it\u2019s not enough).\n \u201cWe need coordinated assistance from consumer protection regulators around the world,\u201d Amazon writes. But the company  lobbied forcefully and successfully against the INFORM act, which would have helped identify sellers with bad intent and add transparency to online marketplaces (strangely, Amazon has  taken some of the actions it objects to independently). And that line is suspiciously absent  when it is Amazon that consumers need to be protected against.\n \u201cIt is also critical that we hold bad actors\u2014and the service providers that provide them with fake reviews\u2014accountable for their activity,\u201d the post continues. But while lawsuits and partnerships with law enforcement are part of that, once again the call to \u201cwork together\u201d rings hollow when Amazon itself is where the activity occurs and the company is in complete control of that ecosystem.

It will also use the investment to continue building out its technology, specifically to help build out better, AI-based techniques of processing and parsing pictures that are taken on smartphones \u2014 by their nature small in size.\n Insight Partners and Georgian co-led the round and it brings the total raised by the company to $115 million.\n Dalyac, a deep learning researcher by training who co-founded the company with Razvan Ranca and Adrien Cohen, said that the \u201copportunity\u201d (if you could call an accident that) Tractable has identified and built to fix is that it\u2019s generally time-consuming and stressful to deal with an insurance company when you are also coping with a problem with your car.\n And while a new generation of \u201cinsuretech\u201d startups have emerged in recent years that are bringing more modern processes into the equation, typically the incumbent major insurance companies \u2014 the ones that Tractable targets \u2014 have lacked the technology to improve that process.\n It\u2019s not unlike the tension between fintech-fuelled neobanks and the incumbent banks, which are now scrambling to invest in more technology to catch up with the times.\n \u201cGetting into an accident can be anything from a hassle to trauma,\u201d Dalyac said. \u201cIt can be devastating, and then the process for recovery is pretty damn slow. You\u2019re dealing with so many touch points with your insurance, so many people that need to come and check things out again. It\u2019s hard to keep track and know when things will truly be back to normal. Our belief is that that whole process can be 10 times faster, thanks to the breakthroughs in image classification.\u201d\n That process currently also extends not just to taking pictures for claims, but also to help figure out when a car is beyond repair, in which case which parts can be recycled and reused elsewhere, also using Tractable\u2019s computer vision technology. Dalyac noted that this was a popular enough service in the last year that the company helped recycle as many cars \u201cas Tesla sold in 2019.\u201d\n Customers that have integrated with Tractable to date include\u00a0Geico in the U.S., as well as a large swathe of insurers in Japan, specifically Tokio Marine Nichido, Mitsui Sumitomo, Aioi Nissay Dowa and Sompo. Cov\u00e9a, the largest auto insurer in France, is also a customer, as is Admiral Seguros, the Spanish entity of UK\u2019s Admiral Group, as well as Ageas, a top UK insurer.\n Japan is the company\u2019s biggest market today Dalyac said \u2014 the reason being that it has an ageing population, but one that is also very strong on mobile usage: combining those two, \u201cautomation is more than a value add; it\u2019s a must have,\u201d Dalyac said. He also added that he thinks the U.S. will overtake Japan as Tractable\u2019s biggest market soon.\n The new directions into property and other car applications will also open the door to a wider set of use cases beyond working with insurance providers over time. It will also bring Tractable potentially into new competitive environments. There are other companies that have also identified this opportunity.\n For example,  Hover, which has built a way to create 3d imagery of homes using ordinary smartphone cameras, is also eyeing ways of selling its tech (originally developed to help make estimates on home repairs) to insurance companies.\n For now, however, it sounds like the opportunity is a big enough one that the race is more to meet demand than it is to beat competitors to do so.\n \u201cTractable\u2019s accelerating growth at scale is a testament to the power and differentiation of their applied machine learning system, which continues to improve as more businesses adopt it,\u201d said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners and Tractable Board member, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to double down on our partnership with Tractable as they work to help the world recover faster from accidents and disasters that affect hundreds of millions of lives.\u201d\n Emily Walsh, Partner at Georgian Partners added: \u201cTractable\u2019s industry-leading computer vision capabilities are continuing to fuel incredible customer ROI and growth for the firm.

with the country&#39;s adoption of bitcoin.   read more\n   Investors have recently demanded higher premiums to hold Salvadoran debt, on growing concerns over the completion of the IMF deal, key to patching budget gaps through 2023.\n On Wednesday, bonds sold off across the curve with the 2032 issue down more than 2 cents to 96.25 cents on the dollar. The spread of Salvadoran debt to U.S. Treasuries  (.JPMEGDELSR) dipped to 705 basis points after hitting on Tuesday a four-month high of 725 bps.\n &#34;There is no fast track for a solution on an IMF program and even uncertainty on whether the bitcoin proposal is compatible with diplomatic U.S. (or) multilateral relations,&#34; said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income strategy at Amherst Pierpont Securities in New York.\n El Salvador this month became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, with President Nayib Bukele touting the cryptocurrency\u2019s potential as a remittance currency for Salvadorans overseas.   read more\n This month, Bukele also pulled out of an anticorruption accord with the Organization of American States, which dismayed the U.S. government, as Washington looks to stem corruption in Central America as part of its immigration policy.\n &#34;The recognition of a &#39;Bukele&#39; risk premium has probably done some permanent damage to investor sentiment,&#34; Morden said on her client note.\n However, the market may be focusing too much on the news headlines and not enough on the possibility of a deal with the IMF, according to Shamaila Khan, head of EM debt strategies at AllianceBernstein in New York.\n &#34;It is important for El Salvador to get the IMF program done. If it was lost on them, they wouldn\u2019t have the conversations,&#34; she said.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:45:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Hundreds of Southwest Airlines flights were delayed or canceled again on Wednesday as the company sought to resolve disruptions from earlier in the week amid a pickup in summer travel.\n  The headaches for Southwest, which is widely credited for pioneering the low-fare airline business model, began on Monday night, when a problem with a weather data supplier prevented the airline from safely flying planes. The issue was resolved within hours, but on Tuesday the airline suffered its own technological problems, resulting in half of its flights that day being delayed and many being canceled, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service.\n Spillover from that episode caused Wednesday\u2019s problems, the airline said. About 10 percent of Southwest\u2019s flights were canceled and another 19 percent were delayed by midafternoon, according to FlightAware.\n \u201cWhile our technology issues from Tuesday have been resolved, we are still experiencing a small number of cancellations and delays across our network as we continue working to resume normal operations,\u201d Dan Landson, a Southwest spokesman, said in a statement.\n Southwest said on Tuesday that it was having problems with \u201cnetwork connectivity.\u201d Mr. Landson said that those troubles were unrelated to the weather data problems from Monday and that there was no indication the airline\u2019s computer systems had been breached or hacked.\n The flight disruptions came at a critical time for a company celebrating its 50th year.\n After seeing demand for travel plummet during the pandemic, airlines are experiencing a rebound as coronavirus cases in the United States fall and vaccinations increase. More people are flying for summer vacations, and businesses and states and cities are opening up. The  governors of California and New York on Tuesday lifted most pandemic restrictions. The Transportation Security Administration screened more than two million people at airports on Sunday, more than at any point since March 2020.\n Southwest was fortunate in that the delays and cancellations occurred during a part of the week that is typically less busy, but thousands of customers were still affected.\n One passenger, Efia Brown, and her daughter were trying to return to their home in St. Louis from Los Angeles on Monday when Southwest Airlines canceled a connecting flight while they were waiting at the airport in Denver. Ms. Brown\u2019s daughter became sick on their earlier flight, and after the airline notified them of the cancellation, Ms. Brown booked another for 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday. But her daughter was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday after vomiting several times at the airport gate. The family is still in Denver.\n \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing because this is the only airline I fly with,\u201d Ms. Brown said. \u201cWhen this happened, it was so frustrating, I had to hold back my tears.\u201d\n Another traveler, Azavier Jackson, 29, said she was disappointed with Southwest, which she was flying for the first time. Her flight from Los Angeles to Charlotte, N.C., was delayed, as was her return trip home on Monday. Ms. Jackson\u2019s connecting flight from Dallas to Los Angeles kept getting pushed back on Monday night, and she left the airport at 6 a.m. on Tuesday. Her biggest frustration was that the airline didn\u2019t inform her of an earlier flight that she could have taken.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not humane to make us wait in the airport that long,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cThere was terrible communication. It felt like they were saying, \u2018Just deal with it.\u2019\u201d\n The disruptions have been difficult for Southwest\u2019s staff, too, said Lyn Montgomery, president of Transport Workers Union Local 556, which represents Southwest\u2019s flight attendants. The airline\u2019s management has been providing regular updates to flight attendants, and Southwest worked to provide accommodations for those who were stranded, she said, adding that such outages happen.\n \u201cWe are all victims to computers and computer issues,\u201d she said, \u201cand when it happens at an airline, it tends to be massive.\u201d\n Like other airlines, Southwest suffered severe losses as the pandemic forced many people to cancel travel plans and stay home for months on end. But the airline, which carried more passengers than any other in the United States in 2019, fared better than most.\n Southwest, which reported an annual loss in 2020, its first in nearly 50 years, entered the pandemic with less debt than any other major U.S. airline. And because it flies largely within the United States, it has been relatively unaffected by the sharp drop in international travel. As a result, Southwest reported a modest profit in the first three months of the year, the first major U.S. airline to make money since the pandemic began.\n So far this year, the airline has announced it was  expanding an order for Boeing\u2019s 737 Max by 100 planes and  recalling all flight attendants who had taken extended leaves of absence in time for the seasonal increase in travel during the summer. In May, Southwest said it  was seeing improvements in demand, and this month it said it would  buy even more Max jets.\n But the rebound hasn\u2019t been without its difficulties. Business travel has yet to recover meaningfully, and the number of people traveling is still about 20 percent below 2019 levels, according to T.S.A. data. Like other airlines, Southwest has also had to contend with a surge in  unruly and sometimes violent behavior from passengers, leading it to pause plans to restart selling alcohol on its flights.",

", "note_en": "About four years ago, Paul Hollowell found out that Amazon was making a gadget he desperately wanted: a camera whose sole purpose was to photograph his clothes.\n The oval camera, called the  Echo Look, worked by photographing several clothing combinations and using artificial intelligence to highlight which outfit looked best. Mr. Hollowell, an entrepreneur and a frequent traveler from Dallas, usually spent hours picking clothes to pack for a trip and believed the camera would help him decide. He ordered one for $200.\n He was correct \u2014 the camera saved time. But what he didn\u2019t predict was that Amazon would send an email three years later with sad news: The product and its app would soon cease to work. The company said it had included some of the Echo Look\u2019s features, like giving style advice, in more popular Amazon products, so it was time to put the digital fashionista to rest.\n Mr. Hollowell, 39, was angry. \u201cYou can sunset the service, but at least let me use the camera,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just did nothing.\u201d\n Many have learned a hard lesson about what it means to be an Amazon customer. Even when you\u2019re paying lots of money, you are a guinea pig at the whims of a company endlessly striving to innovate. At any moment, the company could surprise you with an unwelcome change to an Amazon product you own or decide to kill it altogether.\n Last week, many people who own Amazon devices were automatically enrolled in  Sidewalk, a new internet-sharing program that drew intense scrutiny. Basically, the program lets owners of newer Amazon products share their internet connections with others nearby. If a neighbor\u2019s Ring camera has a spotty internet connection and yours has a strong one, you can share your bandwidth with your neighbor.\n That all sounds nice if everything works as expected, but security experts have raised concerns that device makers could have inappropriate access to people\u2019s data. They advised that people opt out of the program to avoid becoming part of Amazon\u2019s experiment because there are still many unknowns.\n  This high-risk, high-reward approach to innovation is woven into Amazon\u2019s culture. Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, has said Amazon\u2019s  failures cost it billions of dollars. He once told investors that his company was \u201cthe best place in the world to fail (we have a lot of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins.\u201d\n Indeed, Amazon\u2019s unbridled embrace of failure has included high-profile flops in consumer electronics. For about four years, it sold millions of  Amazon Dash Buttons, which you could push to replenish items like toilet paper. Amazon killed the Dash in 2019, after orders placed through the buttons significantly decreased. In 2014, the company  aggressively marketed the Fire, its first smartphone, and shelved it just a year later amid lukewarm reviews and sluggish sales.\n Amazon continues to experiment with kitschy ideas. Last year, it unveiled an  autonomous drone that flies around your home and shoots video to catch intruders. The drone, which was widely panned by the press because of privacy concerns, has yet to be released. Halo, a fitness product that Amazon claims can tell you precisely how fat you are, received mixed ratings from  professional reviewers and  early customers, including complaints that the gadget could give people body dysmorphia.\n Why does Amazon, a brand that probably knows more about what we want to buy than any other company, need to sell us experimental products just to figure out what it\u2019s doing? Tech companies big and small typically do their research and development in house before releasing products to us.\n What\u2019s more, when Amazon fails like this, you, the guinea pig, lose your hard-earned cash and a product you may enjoy. There is also an environmental impact: The electronic device could end up in a landfill, and even if you recycle it, only a small portion of its materials can be reused.\n Lisa Levandowski, an Amazon spokeswoman, said that internal teams tested the company\u2019s inventions extensively but that, because they were novel and ambitious, customer feedback could help improve them. This approach allows Amazon to make products like the Echo and Alexa what they are today, she said.\n Design veterans with experience creating products for big tech brands like Apple and Samsung confirmed that Amazon\u2019s method was atypical. My general recommendation is to think twice before buying cutting-edge tech products made by Amazon \u2014 and if you do, be aware of the risk.\n  A television, no matter how thin, makes an ugly centerpiece in a living room once it\u2019s turned off. With this in mind, Yves B\u00e9har, a Swiss designer, teamed up with Samsung to design a TV that could blend into the room like an art piece, he said.\n  Mr. B\u00e9har said he and Samsung designers had started with making observations about consumers: Homes were getting smaller, and tastes were becoming more eclectic. With that insight, the product developers worked with curators in museums and galleries to assemble art that could be shown on the TV.\n After a few years of testing prototypes and forming partnerships to procure artwork, the collaboration resulted in the 2017 introduction of  the Frame TV, a Samsung television that resembled a picture frame. It used motion sensors to show art when people were present and shut off when nobody was around. The TV has become a best seller.\n Mr. B\u00e9har, who founded Fuseproject, an industrial design firm, said he understood Amazon\u2019s approach as a retail company to rapidly test ideas \u2014 like when it measures how customers respond to different prices in its stores. But \u201cwith hardware, people end up being left with stuff that\u2019s useless or doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the world that we live in today, with global warming and plastics and waste, I do think it\u2019s something to be very careful about.\u201d\n Don Norman, who founded the Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego, and wrote the book \u201cThe Design of Everyday Things,\u201d said that throughout his career, he had seen some other companies use approaches similar to Amazon\u2019s.\n In the 1990s, when Mr. Norman worked with Apple as a user experience architect, the company collaborated with Sony on a product. He said Apple had planned to spend years doing market research and testing prototypes before shipping it.\n \u201cSony laughed at us and said: \u2018What a stupid way of doing things. We just build a product, and we sell it. We get the feedback, and we kill it and do a better one. It\u2019s much more efficient and faster than your method,\u2019\u201d Mr. Norman said.\n This on-the-fly approach to development is unpopular, he said, because most companies recognize that customers get angry when gadgets are quickly killed. \u201cThere\u2019s some logic to it but also a complete disrespect to what it might mean to your customers or environment or the world,\u201d Mr. Norman said.\n Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, a company that sells parts for people to repair gadgets, said there were better ways than Amazon\u2019s to discontinue products. When Pebble, a smartwatch maker, shut down in 2016, the company said the software  would continue to work. People continued to enjoy the product  years after the company\u2019s death.\n Mr. Norman\u2019s advice for consumers is simple: Protest. Amazon is more likely to change its ways if people complain when they are treated as guinea pigs and steer clear of experimental gadgets like surveillance drones until they are proved to be lasting products.\n Mr. Hollowell is an example of how tough it can be to pacify unhappy customers. When Amazon was announcing the death of the Echo Look, the company sent two emails. The first included a promotional code to get a newer product, the Echo Show 5, for free. Mr. Hollowell took the offer but found that the Echo Show was a poor substitute: The camera was subpar and lacked software to organize his closet, he said.\n The second email was a reminder that the Echo Look would soon be dead and that it could be recycled. Mr. Hollowell missed the part about recycling. \u201cI very distinctly remember putting it in the trash one day because it just wasn\u2019t working,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:44:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,amazon,\u56de\u58f0,dash", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4f7f\u7528\u50cf\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u6309\u94ae\u548c\u56de\u58f0\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4f7f\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7531\u4e8e\u9500\u552e\u989d\u6216\u8d1f\u9762\u53cd\u9988\u800c\u592a\u5feb\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u5907 ", "title_en": "With products like Dash Buttons and Echo Look, Amazon uses customers to test features then sunsets the devices too quickly due to low sales or negative feedback", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/technology/personaltech/buyers-of-amazon-devices-are-guinea-pigs-thats-a-problem.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "amazon", "\u56de\u58f0", "dash"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a4cb500f427207e16f55b041bbe9d305.jpg", "infoid": 1066329, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Apple\u7684Kevin Lynch\uff0cTechnology\u7684VP\u548cDeidre Caldbeck\uff0c\u4ea7\u54c1\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u804a\u5929\u4e0eApple Watch\u548cHealth\uff0c\u65b0\u529f\u80fdl ...

", "note_en": "Since its inception screen printing has been transforming the world by producing art, posters, and colorful patterns on textiles. New developments in the realm of material sciences will propel this technology to the center of next-generation electronics.\n  Screen printing, as the name suggests, is a printing technique based on a patterned screen. The screen is made up of threads with small openings through which ink can be passed onto a substrate. Patterning is achieved by using a light-sensitive emulsion to block the openings where no ink is supposed to flow. To know more about screen printing check out this superb tutorial by Applied Science on YouTube.\n  Multiple copies of the same pat  tern can be printed quickly, and this makes screen printing ideal for large-scale production or even producing small batches of customized solutions. Nearly all customized logo apparel is made with screen printing. So, can this technique be employed to manufacture next-generation electronics? The answer is yes!\n  Currently, electronics are mainly produced by subtractive processes like PCB etching which are unsustainable. Screen printing, being an additive process, saves materials and energy can make manufacturing sustainable. This technology is highly developed and is behind most of the printed textiles in the market today.\n Screen printing electronics has been known for quite some time. Membrane switches and RFIDs are manufactured using conductive silver ink. But recent advances in material sciences have resulted in commercially feasible inks with copper, carbon, conductive polymers, and many more. Combined with large-scale manufacturing, this technique can replace conventionally manufactured PCB-based sensors and small electronic devices.\n  The most obvious application of screen printing is to print copper directly onto FR-4 PCB substrates. Such inks can be sourced easily via  Copprint or  Novacentrix to name a few. The best part of using these inks that they are directly solderable, so need for silver epoxy or likes. The YouTube video below shows the application of Copprint\u2019s copper ink onto FR-4.\n   Of course, one needs to consider the economic and technical feasibility of new innovative techniques. Let us consider a regular double-sided Arduino UNO board with dimensions 68.6 mm x 53.4 mm. Assume that we need to cover 100% of both sides, which means we need to print 0.00733 square meters of ink. Consider the thickness of the dry layer is chosen to be 25 microns because the datasheets normalize the sheet resistance to this thickness.\n One of the thinnest traces on the Arduino board has a width of about 11 mils. So let\u2019s consider a trace of that width and having a length of twice the board length, i.e., 2 x 68.6 mm. The following table lists the cost of coating a double-sided Arduino UNO PCB (including a 20% ink loss) and the resistance of the above-defined \u2018thin trace\u2019.  This table does not include Novacentrix inks because their datasheets do not state the theoretical coverage of the ink.\n  An Arduino UNO board screen printed with conductive inks has a cost of about $1.19 to $1.89. The thinnest trace on the PCB will exhibit electrical resistance between 1.08 ohms to 6.37 ohms. Copper inks are more economical and offer better electrical performance. However, for applications that require biocompatibility, silver inks from  Dycotec Materials and others are more suitable.\n    Ynvisible\u2019s Electrochromic  Ink Kit is ideal if you want to build displays instead of just PCBs. Electrochromic displays change their color in response to an electric impulse. You could include these low-power displays in your next IoT project.\n   Want to build something bright? Then follow this tutorial by the Zurich University of Arts to screenprint electroluminescent devices. These devices emit light in response to an electrical signal.\n   The beauty of screen printing electronics lies in its scalability. You can use a screen printer to print several thousands of devices in a single day. One can even print disposable eco-friendly RFIDs on paper! Or mass produces health sensors using roll-to-roll screen printing like  Mekoprint. This revolution in the electronics industry is just getting started.\n  So what are you planning to make with a screen printer? Comment below if you have any questions or suggestions. You can message me on LinkedIn if you want to discuss the new opportunities made possible by screen printing.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:43:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

store in the San Francisco area after residents suggested the drug businesses may have been a target of rampant, monthslong shoplifting.\n       The store is  set to permanently shut its doors on March 17, and the move has  drawn an online petition against the closure, which accrued over 200 signatures at the time of publishing. The closure is the third since mid-October 2020, and those living in the area reported brazen thefts at Walgreens pharmacies throughout their hometowns.\n    \u201cAll of us knew it was coming. Whenever we go in there, they always have problems with shoplifters, \u201d a regular customer, Sebastian Luke, told the   San Francisco Chronicle.\n One October incident was  caught on video as  Inside Edition reporters were following a story on the rampant larcenies. A thief, donning black clothing, was seen on video scaling a counter, grabbing an air vent, and leaving the store on a scooter as shelves in the store were left bare from similar sprees.\n  \u201cI feel sorry for the clerks, they are regularly being verbally assaulted,\u201d Luke said. \u201cThe clerks say there is nothing they can do. They say Walgreens\u2019 policy is to not get involved. They don\u2019t want anyone getting injured or getting sued, so the guys just keep coming in and taking whatever they want.\u201d\n At the time, Walgreens declined to provide a reason for the store closures but indicated \u201cthe safety of our team members and customers is our top concern.\u201d The drug store chain did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the  Washington Examiner.\n When a store employee was asked about why the shelves were empty, he said, \u201cGo ask the people in the alleys, they have it all.\u201d\n One store in the San Francisco area reportedly lost $1,000 a day to theft, and some have pointed to the city&#39;s homeless as a potential culprit. Law enforcement at the time responded by stationing uniformed officers near the businesses, but the move didn&#39;t last, and officers were quickly pulled away from the post.\n  Under California law, theft under $950 is considered a misdemeanor, but many prosecutors throughout the state have opted to free those charged with the offense under certain conditions rather than holding them in jail for the maximum sentence of six months.\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n                Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:43:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71,san,walgreens", "title": "Walgreens\u767e\u53f6\u7a9710\u5bb6\u5e97\u5728\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u5e97\u7531\u4e8e\u7316\u7357\u7684\u5165\u5e97\u884c\u7a83 ", "title_en": "Walgreens shutters 10 stores in San Francisco due to rampant shoplifting", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/walgreens-shutters-10-stores-in-san-francisco-as-residents-point-to-rampant-shoplifting/ar-BB1ef4Hc", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71", "san", "walgreens"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "131f32dbc237e646c2ac3cd5097a1037.png", "infoid": 1066325, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "300+\u68c0\u67e5\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709AWS\u5730\u533a\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002 \u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5305\u62ecHIPAA\uff0cPCI DSS\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u5b89\u5168\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u6700\u65b0\uff08V1.4.0\uff09CIS\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a  \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u60f3\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6b64Mod\uff08\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\uff09\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u7231\u60a8\u52a0\u5165\u793e\u533a\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u8d21\u732e\u3002 \uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u60a8\u53ea\u60f3\u5e2e\u52a9\u6587\u6863\u3002\uff09  \u8bf7\u53c2\u9605\u8d21\u732e\u6307\u5357\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u5219\u3002 \u6240\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8eApache 2.0\u5f00\u6e90\u8bb8\u53ef\u3002 ", "note_en": "300+ checks covering industry defined security best practices across all AWS regions.

", "note_en": "Happy to announce version 1.0.0 of the  Big Time Public License, a software license that\u2019s free for noncommercial and small-business use, with a guarantee of fair commercial terms for big-company users.\n        These terms let you use and share this software for noncommercial purposes and in small business for free, while also guaranteeing that paid licenses for big businesses will be available on fair terms.\n  As usual, writing this part was the most difficult and important part. I\u2019ve written about this  elsewhere. I will probably never be happy with this paragraph for more than five minutes at a time.\n  In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.\n  This license is very much informed by  Blue Oak and the  PolyForm licenses. It\u2019s most directly a \u201cfork\u201d of PolyForm  Noncommercial and  Small Business.\n    I\u2019ve avoided PolyForm\u2019s \u201cpluggable\u201d concept of \u201cpermitted purpose\u201d, for clarity. We\u2019ll likely do the same in the next versions of the PolyForm licenses. Makes for easier reading.\n  Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious observance, without any anticipated commercial application, count as use for noncommercial purposes.\n    Use by any charitable organization, educational institution, public research organization, public safety or health organization, environmental protection organization, or government institution counts as use for noncommercial purposes, regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting from the funding.\n    Many drafters, including this one, continue to have misgivings about whether American universities really deserve this generosity. This week\u2019s link on that theme  here. There will be another next week.\n  You may use the software for the benefit of your company if it meets all these criteria:\n  had fewer than 100 total individuals working as employees and independent contractors at all times during the last tax year\n    received less than 1,000,000 USD (2019) total debt, equity, and other investment in the last five tax years, counting investment in predecessor companies that reorganized into, merged with, or spun out your company\n  Adjust these dollar figures for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 consumer price index for all urban consumers, United States city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, with 1982\u20131984=100 reference base.\n  This comes largely from  PolyForm Small Business, with the addition of the financing prong. Folks interested in this license were particularly concerned not to exempt well financed startups.\n    This serves as a time limit on license negotiations. If your business starts out small but grows over the limits, you have 128 days of free use to get a deal done.\n  indefinitely, if the licensor or their legal successor does not offer a fair commercial license for the software within 32 days of  written request\n  This is the teeth of the guarantee that fair licenses will be available to big business. If you need a big-company license, reach out for a big-company license, and either don\u2019t get a response, or get a clearly unfair, unreasonable, or discriminatory proposal, this is your fallback.\n  If this software includes an address for the licensor or an agent of the licensor in a standard place, such as in documentation, software package metadata, or an \u201cabout\u201d page or screen, try to request a fair commercial license at that address. If this package includes both online and offline addresses, try online before offline. If you can\u2019t deliver a request that way, or this software doesn\u2019t include any addressees, spend one hour online researching an address, recording all your searches and inquiries as you go, and try any addresses that you find. If you can\u2019t find any addresses, or if those addresses also fail, that counts as failure to offer a fair commercial license by the licensor under  Big Business.\n  I was torn here. On the one hand, a \u201cfixed form\u201d license, without blanks to fill out at the top, aids standardization, and is often just easier for everyone to handle. On the other hand, the license text is an obvious place to identify the licensor and share contact information. We need contact information so big companies can reach out to licensors for paid terms.\n  In practice, we have the Internet. It\u2019s rarely difficult to put a name and an e-mail address to published source code. So the approach here is to set a baseline expectation for good faith effort to reach the licensor, without requiring companies to hire private investigators to secure software licenses.\n  The licensor grants you a copyright license to do everything with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor\u2019s copyright in it for any purpose allowed by these terms.\n    You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with  Required Notice: that the licensor provided with the software. For example:\n      The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software.\n    You may have \u201cfair use\u201d rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.\n    These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses.\n    If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.\n    The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.\n    As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.\n  All of the above come right out of PolyForm Noncommercial, with some small readability and consistency tweaks.\n  The  licensor is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the  software is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.\n    Your company is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization.  Control means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise. Control can be direct or indirect.\n  Your licenses are all the licenses granted to you for the software under these terms.\n    A  fair commercial license allows use of the software in business by a company that does not qualify under  Small Business, for a fair price, on reasonable terms, without discriminating against any particular licensee. A fair commercial license may be perpetual or for a term, and may or may not cover new versions of the software.\n  We could have just said \u201cfair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory license\u201d above, and relied on usage in trade and developing case law to flesh that out. We don\u2019t want to sacrifice the flexibility in that concept, or to make our use of it here unrecognizable. On the other hand, experience with FRAND councils a bit of clarification.\n  This license itself discriminates, in that it privileges some users and organizations with free use, while requiring others to deal. In the vast majority of cases, that will fairly (and, I believe, legally) reflect massive differences in the costs of negotiating with large for-profit companies, as well as the kinds of legal terms\u2014warranties, indemnities\u2014deemed \u201creasonable\u201d in that commercial context. Still, \u201cdiscriminating\u201d here is somewhat narrowed to discrimination against \u201cspecific licensees\u201d.\n  The last sentence is arguably the most important. Free users effectively get a perpetual license, so long as they qualify. But large commercial licensees buy a mix of perpetual and subscription licenses all the time. It will effectively be up to the licensor what structure they want to propose. Of course, the licensee can try to negotiate a change. But not with arguments that only their preferred structure meets the requirements written out here.\n  A  fair price is a fair market price for a fair commercial license. If the licensor advertises a price or price structure for generally available fair commercial licenses, and more than one customer not affiliated with the licensor has paid that price in the past year, that is fair.\n  Earlier drafts of this license placed much firmer upper limits on fair price, based on statistical measures of average coder compensation. I\u2019ve removed that limit for 1.0.0. First because it\u2019s redundant of the more general requirements of fairness and reasonableness. Second because its numerical specificity had the potential to massively over- and under-value specific projects.\n  Declaring published pricing for previous arms-length transactions \u201cfair\u201d may also be redundant. But I anticipate that will be a common case. The certainty should be welcome.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:42:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65f6\u95f4,\u8bb8\u53ef", "title": "\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc11.0.0 ", "title_en": "Big Time Public License 1.0.0", "transed": 1, "url": "https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/06/15/Big-Time-1.0.0.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u95f4", "\u8bb8\u53ef"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3b7addec870d4f757dd7748f5bf1b2f8.jpg", "infoid": 1066323, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u603b\u517115\u500d\u7684\u9a7b\u624e\u00b7\u804c\u52a1830\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5e74\u524d\u3002\n  Stebbings\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u57fa\u91d1\u65e9\u671f20VC\uff0c\u5c06\u5728250,000\u7f8e\u5143\u5230750,000\u7f8e\u5143\u4e4b\u95f4\u6295\u8d44\u652f\u7968\uff0c\u800c\u4ed6\u7684\u589e\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u91d120VC\u63a2\u9669\u5bb6\u5c06\u6295\u8d44B\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u652f\u7968\u5728100\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u81f3500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\n 20VC\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e9b\u62a5\u544a\u7684Unicorns\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u97f3\u9891App Clubhouse\u548c\u865a\u62df\u6d3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005Hopin\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4ed6\u6240\u627f\u62c5\u7684\u6210\u529f -

But, maybe more notable, is what his assumed success \u2013 as a 24 year-old who has won a spot in competitive deals and raised a massive venture capital fund \u2013 means for the way that tech is evolving.\n First, media experience, and the ability to spout useful content in a noisy world, is being increasingly valued as an asset in the modernizing world of VC. This week, Andreessen Horowitz launched Future, a full-fledged media operation that will cover trends in startups and tech.Stebbings\u2019 podcast, which has over 200,000 subscribers and 80 million downloads to date, has cultivated an audience by interviewing tech\u2019s elite, from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone to Slack founder Stewart Butterfield and to A16z\u2019s Angela Strange. Those connections getting leveraged into dollars is a proof point of this growing idea, and sometimes meme, that Twitter followers can help anyone start a rolling fund.\n Which brings me to my second point, which is that Stebbings raising such a massive tranche of capital could quiet some of the worry around emerging fund managers being unable to, well, 15X their initial micro-funds. In other words: you might be able to get a few of your buddies to venture to throw some checks in, but how do you get a full endowment to sign on board? Based on recent conversations I\u2019ve had with emerging fund managers, it\u2019s hard to get institutions, the ones with real check-writing power, on board for new funds because they only have so much capital allocated toward venture.

A lot of automakers, Toyota included, are looking for what\u2019s next. Automakers are very well positioned to leverage what they already know about robotics and manufacturing to take on the robotics market.

The 2021 show was, like so many other things over the past year-and-a-half, a historic anomaly. After opting to skip the 2020 show altogether (understandably), it went ahead with the first \u2014 and for the time being, last \u2014 all virtual event.\n The virtual event always seems like a good idea, in theory. In practice, results vary wildly depending on a number of factors, not the least of which is content. Many shows have an uphill battle when it comes to moving all online. CES, I think, was a struggle, due in part to the size of the show, but also the content. As ubiquitous as consumer electronics are, I don\u2019t see wide swaths of the internet champing at the bit to watch a presentation from anyone but, say, Apple and maybe Samsung.\n   E3 doesn\u2019t have that problem. The show already had a leg up, having moved away from industry-only to something more hybrid years ago. Unlike other shows I attend regularly, people in downtown LA actually get a bit of a buzz when E3 comes to town. Everyone\u2019s a gamer and most are excited about some piece of upcoming news. Uber and Lyft drivers love to tell you about it that week.\n It follows that the show\u2019s online presence is immense. The days leading up to the event, E3-related content was trending all over the place \u2014 people watch trailers, argue about the trailers, stream about the trailers and argue about other people\u2019s streams about the trailers on their own streams. It\u2019s a recipe for success around a virtual event \u2014 especially coming after a year when, even before the latest Xbox and PlayStation were released, the industry was already setting records amid the pandemic.\n Of the big three, Microsoft won, hands down. Sorry, Sony, you can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play. Nintendo was solid, but not spectacular. But more on that in a moment.\n  I talked a fair bit about the Xbox press conference  in the last one of these. But the long and short of it is Microsoft won on two flanks: sheer volume and Game Pass titles. That last bit feels about as close to a silver bullet as we\u2019re going to see in this generation of consoles. Likely Sony is going to have its own virtual event in the near future \u2014 but it\u2019s going to be a tough act to follow.\n In all, Microsoft showed off 30 games (and a fridge), a whopping 27 of which will be available on Game Pass, if there were any doubt as to how all-in the company is on its subscription service. And, of course, there\u2019s the fact that this was billed as a Microsoft/Bethesda event, which shows you how important that massive acquisition is to the future of Xbox.\n As for Nintendo, let\u2019s be honest. Anything that didn\u2019t include the long-rumored Switch Pro was going to be a disappointment. The original Switch is four years old and due for a big upgrade, beyond the Switch Lite and a refresh with added battery. It\u2019s time for that HD screen \u2014 the thing would sell like hotcakes next holiday.\n  Thing is, the Switch had a spectacular 2020. Even with an initial supply chain shortage (something all three current consoles are guilty of), it did gangbusters during the pandemic, due in no small part to the arrival of a long-awaited new Animal Crossing game. A low-pressure, social title between fuzzy animals was precisely what the world needed last year, and Nintendo was happy to deliver.\n There\u2019s also a good chance that Nintendo is dealing with continued supply chain issues around the new components. So while it seems likely the Pro is on the way (see: the new Guardians of the Galaxy game), we\u2019ll likely have to wait until next year.\n  We\u2019ll also have to wait until next year for Breath of the Wild 2, but at least the sequel to the much-loved Zelda game had the decency to show up this year. And, of course, we\u2019ve got a bunch of great-looking titles coming for the system. Some highlights.\n          Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania arrives October 5, doing what Super Monkey Ball does best.\n In addition to all of the Square-Enix and Ubisoft stuff we discussed last time, Capcom gave us updates to Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin and Resident Evil Village.\n  That about does it. See you next year in LA. But maybe leave the Minion costumes at home (sorry Mr. Mayor).", "posttime": "2021-06-17 06:05:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "e3,\u6e38\u620f", "title": "E3 2021\u5305\u88c5 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tE3 2021 wrap-up\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/e3-2021-wrap-up/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["e3", "\u6e38\u620f"]}]
