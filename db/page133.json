It also stretches out to full micro-ATX size, and adds more expansion slots so that you can easily design and add your own peripherals.\n   The Raspberry Pi Pico is the core of the Neotron Pico. It uses PIO statemachines to generate 12-bit Super VGA video, and digital 16 bit 48 kHz stereo audio. It also has both I\u00b2C and SPI buses. SPI chipselects and IRQs are handled by an SPI-to-GPIO expander. This provides eight chip-selects and eight IRQs, to support up to eight expansion slots or peripherals. The eight chip-selects are gated with a tri-state bus transceiver, allowing the Pico to talk to either the I/O exander, or the selected expansion slot. The board has an SD Card fitted in the &#39;Slot 1&#39; position, and the Board Management Controller in the &#39;Slot 0&#39; position, leaving &#39;Slot 2&#39; through to &#39;Slot 7&#39; available for expansion. Each expansion slot has both I\u00b2C and SPI, along with unique chip-select and IRQ signals.\n  The Neotron Pico is designed to run the Neotron OS - a CP/M or MS-DOS alike OS written in Rust. But, being open-hardware, you can program your Neotron Pico to do pretty much anything.\n  12-bit (4096 colour) VGA video output Capable of 640x480 @ 60 Hz 16-colour and 320x240 @ 60 Hz 256-colour graphics modes\n     The limited I/O on the Pico (we are using half the available pins just for the video output) is supplemented using a Microchip MCP23S17 SPI to GPIO expander, and an octal buffer. See the  I/O Expanders section for more details.\n   The Raspberry Pi Silicon RP2040 generates 12-bit VGA video at a range of standard resolutions (including 640x480 @ 60 Hz).\n  The design could easily be adapted to remove the TPF133A/THS7316 video buffer and the TPD7S019 level shifter/filter, and instead use the  1BitSquared DVI PMOD board if you prefer a DVI output (using an HDMI connector).\n  The audio subsystem offers 16-bit 48 kHz stereo audio in and out through a classic blue/green/pink triple 3.5mm TRS jack. Input and Output volume can be software controlled.\n Extra line-level output pin header (e.g. for additional RCA audio jacks - operates in addition to 3.5mm headphone jack output)\n Internal line-level input pin header (e.g. for CD-ROM audio - disabled when 3.5mm line-in jack in-use)\n  Power-on Reset sequencing, soft shutdown, voltage monitoring and PS/2 interfacing is handled by a separate STM32F0 SoC.\n   Note that in the above table, the UART signals are wired as  Data Terminal Equipment (DTE).\n This design should also be pin-compatible with the following SoCs (although the software may need recompiling):\n  Note that not all STM32 pins are 5V-tolerant, and the PS/2 protocol is a 5V open-collector system, so ensure that whichever part you pick has 5V-tolerant pins (marked  FT or  FTt in the datasheet) for the PS/2 signals. All of the parts above  should be OK, but they haven&#39;t been tested. Let us know if you try one!\n      Because we used so many pins on the Pico for Audio and Video, we don&#39;t have enough pins to use for  Chip Select lines. Each device we wish to communicate with on the SPI bus must have a unique chip select line and so have limited lines means we could only have a limited number of SPI devices.\n However, in this design, we cheat and use a Microchip MCP23S17 I/O expander. This is an SPI peripheral with 16 GPIO pins that can be controlled by sending it commands over SPI. It also has an IRQ output which be programmed to fire when the input pins match a certain state.\n The problem would come when the Pico has finished talking to our select SPI device - how does it tell the MCP23S17 to release the current chip select, without the SPI bus traffic also going to the currently selected expansion slot? We resolve this by using a simple 8-bit buffer with an enable pin. This allows the Pico to disconnect all of the chip select signals at once, regardless of the output of the MCP23S17. Once this is disabled, we know we are talking to only the MCP23S17 and the Pico can command it to select the next chip select of interest to us.\n Interrupts are also processed through the MCP23S17. We configure the device to provide an IRQ (edge, active low) whenever any of the eight IRQ inputs are active (programmable for edge or level, active high/rising or low/falling). When the Pico receives an IRQ from the MCP23S17, it must do a read of the pins (using SPI) to find out which device actually raised the interrupt. This model is similar to that used in the IBM PC - where the Intel 8088 must talk to an Intel 8259A programmable interrupt controller over the ISA bus to find out which interrupt was raised - except that in our case, our CPU is very fast and our bus is pretty slow, so our interrupt latency isn&#39;t very good. Worse, if there is a big SPI transaction happening (such as transferring a 512 byte block from an SD card) when an interrupt fires, the Pico will have to wait for that to complete before it can talk to the MCP23S17 to handle the IRQ. That or it could just drop the SPI transaction mid-way through and re-try it later (if your expansion device can tolerate such rudeness).\n +------+ +-----+| |----------OUTPUT_EN--------------&gt;| || | | || | +----------+ | || | | | | || | | |----CS0---&gt;| |----CS0----------------------------------+| | | | | | || | | |----CS1---&gt;| B |----CS1------------------------------+ || | | | | U | | || | | |----CS2---&gt;| F |----CS2--------------------------+ | || | | | | F | | | || | | |----CS3---&gt;| E |----CS3----------------------+ | | || | | | | R | | | | || | | |----CS4---&gt;| |----CS4------------------+ | | | || | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS5---&gt;| |----CS5--------------+ | | | | || | | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS6---&gt;| |----CS6----------+ | | | | | || Pico | | MCP23S17 | | | | | | | | | || | | |----CS7---&gt;| |----CS7------+ | | | | | | || | | | +-----+ v v v v v v v v| | | | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+| |----CS----&gt;| | | S | S | S | S | S | S | S | S || |&lt;---IRQ----| | | l | l | l | l | l | l | l | l || |&lt;===SPI===&gt;| |&lt;============SPI============&gt;| o | o | o | o | o | o | o | o || | | | | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t || | | | | | | | | | | | || | | | | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 || | | | +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+| | | |&lt;---IRQ7-----------------------+ | | | | | | || | | | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ6---------------------------+ | | | | | || | | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ5-------------------------------+ | | | | || | | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ4-----------------------------------+ | | | || | | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ3---------------------------------------+ | | || | | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ2-------------------------------------------+ | || | | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ1-----------------------------------------------+ || | | | || | | |&lt;---IRQ0---------------------------------------------------++------+ +----------+\n  The seven expansion sockets allow you to add on I\u00b2C or SPI based devices at a later date. Each provides a single chip-select and a single IRQ line - the motherboard design should ensure each socket gets a unique signal for each of these. Each expansion device should also contain a AT24C256 or similar EEPROM device. To allow these EEPROM devices to be scanned, each slot also contains three  EEPROM_ADDRESS pins, tied to Vcc or GND in a unique combination. These should be connected through to the EEPROM address lines on your AT24C256, thus ensuring that each expansion card has its EEPROM at a unique address - 0x50 on Slot 0 through to a maximum possible 0x57 for Slot 7. Where your board has on-board devices, you should fit an AT24C256 EEPROM for each device so that the on-board devices can be discovered, exactly as if they were on an expansion card.\n The expansion slot is a simple 2x10 header. We suggest the use of a TE card-edge connector, but you could equally use two 1x10 pin-headers if desired.\n  SPI_COPI 1 2 GND SPI_CIPO 3 4 GND SPI_CLK 5 6 GND ~SPI_CS 7 8 ~IRQ I2C_SDA 9 10 I2C_SCL EEPROM_ADDR0 11 12 EEPROM_ADDR1 EEPROM_ADDR2 13 14 ~RESET 5V 15 16 5V 3V3 17 18 3V3 GND 19 20 GND\n Four expansion slots line up with the ATX case expansion brackets, allowing you to use cards with external connectors. Note that these are aligned the &#34;PCI way around&#34; with components facing away from the board&#39;s I/O area, rather than the &#34;ISA way around&#34; which would have the components facing the I/O area. A further three of the expansion slots are available for internal use only.\n  All I\u00b2C device address given below are 7-bit values. The first byte in a message is the  control byte; this is comprised of the device address in the top seven bits, and an extra bit at the bottom to indicate read (1) or write (0).\n The memory addresses given are 8-bit values used to access the contents of an I\u00b2C device, and are usually supplied as the second byte in a message.\n      A Mikro Electronika Click adaptor, allow many of the range of  Click boards to be fitted\n    An ISA adaptor card (taking an ISA card at right-angles, i.e. parallel to the base board) - a simple microcontroller should be able to bit-bang the ISA bus at 8 MHz and offer an SPI peripheral interface to the Neotron Expansion Slot\n An IDE interface card, allowing 40-pin IDE Hard Disk Drives and CD-ROM drives to be used - this will be quite similar to an ISA bus adaptor\n A floppy drive controller card - either using an eSPI Super I/O chip, or connecting a legacy ISA bus floppy controller as per the ISA adaptor\n A video card for a second monitor output, perhaps based on the CPLD used in the  VGAtonic\n     $ git config --global filter.kicad_project.clean &#34;sed -E &#39;s/^update=.*$/update=Date/&#39;&#34;$ git config --global filter.kicad_project.smudge cat$ git config --global filter.kicad_sch.clean &#34;sed -E &#39;s/#(PWR|FLG)[0-9]+/#\\1?/&#39;&#34;$ git config --global filter.kicad_sch.smudge cat\n      Please note that the models provided in the  Kicad/Models directory are from various manufacturers.

"The following story happened in 1985 but subsequently vanished into obscurity. Over the years, many details have been twisted, others created. Even the original storytellers got some things just plain wrong. After extensive research, writer Nickolai Belakovski is able to present, for the first time to an English-speaking audience, the complete story of Soyuz T-13\u2019s mission to save Salyut 7, a fascinating piece of in-space repair history.\n  It\u2019s getting dark, and Vladimir Dzhanibekov is cold. He has a flashlight, but no gloves. Gloves make it difficult to work, and he needs to work quickly. His hands are freezing, but it doesn\u2019t matter. His crew\u2019s water supplies are limited, and if they don\u2019t fix the station in time to thaw out its water supply, they\u2019ll have to abandon it and go home, but the station is too important to let that happen. Quickly, the sun sets. Working with the flashlight by himself is cumbersome, so Dzhanibekov returns to the ship that brought them to the station to warm up and wait for the station to complete its pass around the night side of the Earth. [1]\n He\u2019s trying to rescue Salyut 7, the latest in a series of troubled yet increasingly successful Soviet space stations. Its predecessor, Salyut 6, finally returned the title of longest manned space mission to the Soviets, breaking the 84-day record set by Americans on Skylab in 1974 by 10 days. A later mission extended that record to 185 days. After Salyut 7\u2019s launch into orbit in April 1982, the first mission to the new station further extended that record to 211 days. The station was enjoying a relatively trouble-free start to life. [4]\n However, this was not to last. On February 11, 1985, while Salyut 7 was in orbit on autopilot awaiting its next crew, mission control (TsUP) noticed something was off. Station telemetry reported that there had been a surge of current in the electrical system, which led to the tripping of overcurrent protection and the shutdown of the primary radio transmitter circuits. The backup radio transmitters had been automatically activated, and as such there was no immediate threat to the station. Mission controllers, very tired now that the end of their 24-hour shift was approaching, made a note to call specialists from the design bureaus for the radio and electrical systems. The specialists would analyze the situation, and produce a report and recommendation, but for now the station was fine, and the next shift was ready to come on duty.[9]\n Without waiting for the specialists to arrive, or perhaps not bothering to call them in the first place, the controllers on the next shift decided to reactivate the primary radio transmitter. Perhaps the overcurrent protection had been tripped accidentally, and if not, then it should still be functional and should still activate if there really was a problem. The controllers, acting against established tradition and procedures of their office, sent the command to reactivate the primary radio transmitter. Instantly, a cascade of electrical shorts swept through the station, and knocked out not only the radio transmitters, but also the receivers. At 1:20pm and 51 seconds on February 11, 1985, Salyut 7 fell silent and unresponsive. [8][9]\n  The situation put flight controllers in an uncomfortable position. One option available to them was to simply abandon Salyut 7 and wait for its successor, Mir, to become available before continuing the manned space program. Mir was on schedule to be launched within one year, but waiting for Mir to become available would not only mean suspending the space program for a year; it also meant that a significant amount of scientific work and engineering tests planned for Salyut 7 would have to go undone. Moreover, admitting defeat would be an embarrassment for the Soviet space program, particularly painful considering the multitude of previous failures in the Salyut series as well as the apparent successes the Americans were enjoying with the Space Shuttle. [9]\n    There was only one other option: fly a repair crew to the station to fix it from the inside, manually. But this could easily become yet another failure. The standard procedures for docking to a space station were entirely automated and relied heavily on information from the station itself about its precise orbital and spatial coordinates. During those rare occurrences when the automated system failed and a manual approach was required, the failures were all within several hundred meters of the station. How does one approach a silent space station? [9] The lack of communication presented another problem: there was no way to know the status of the onboard systems. While the station was designed to fly autonomously, the automated systems could only cope with so many failures before human intervention would be required.\u00a0The station could be fine upon the repair crew&#39;s arrival, requiring no more repair work than replacing the damaged transmitters, or there could have been a fire on the station, or it could have depressurized from having been struck by space debris, etc.; there would be no way to know.[3]\n If there was a meeting in which top managers discussed and weighed all the options, the notes of that meeting have not been made public. What *is* known, however, is that the Soviets decided to attempt a repair mission. This would mean rewriting the book on docking procedures from scratch and hoping that nothing else went wrong aboard the station while communication was down, because if something else did go wrong, the repair crew might not be able to handle it. It was a bold move.\n  The first order of business for the repair mission was figuring out how they would get to the station. For an approach to the station under better circumstances, the Soyuz (a 3-seat ship used to ferry cosmonauts to and from space stations) would receive information from the station via mission control (TsUP) as soon as it reached orbit, long before the station would be visible to the crew. This communication would contain information about the orbit of the space station so that the visiting craft could plot a rendezvous orbit. Once the two craft were 20-25km apart, a direct line of communication would be established between the station and the ship, and the automated system would bring the two craft together and complete the docking.[3]\n  Although all Soyuz pilots were trained to perform a manual docking, it was rare for the automated system to fail. Of those rare failures, the worst was in June 1982 on Soyuz T-6 when a computer failure stopped the automated docking process 900m away from the station. Vladimir Dzhanibekov immediately took over controls and successfully docked his Soyuz with Salyut 7 a full 14 minutes ahead of schedule [4]. Naturally, Dzhanibekov was the leading candidate to pilot any proposed mission to rescue Salyut 7.\n An entirely new set of docking techniques had to be developed, and this was done under a project titled \u201cdocking with a non-cooperative object.\u201d [5] The station\u2019s orbit would be measured using ground-based radar, and this information would be communicated to the Soyuz, which would then plot a rendezvous course. The goal was to get the ship within 5km of the station, from which point it was deemed a manual docking was technically possible. [3] The conclusion of those responsible for developing these new techniques were that the odds of mission success were 70 to 80 percent, after proper modifications to the Soyuz. [2],[3] The Soviet government accepted the risk, deeming the station too valuable to simply let it fall from orbit uncontrolled.\n    Modifications to the Soyuz began. The automated docking system would be removed entirely, and a laser rangefinder installed in the cockpit to assist the crew in determining their distance and approach rate. The crew would also bring night vision goggles in case they had to dock with the station on the night side. The third seat of the ship was removed, and extra supplies, like food and, as would later prove critical, water, were brought on board. The weight saved by the removal of the automatic system and the third chair were used to fill the propellant tanks to their maximum possible level. [1],[3],[11]\n  When it came to selecting a flight crew, two things were very important. First of all, the pilot should have had experience performing a manual docking in orbit, not just in simulators, and secondly, the flight engineer would need to be very familiar with Salyut 7\u2019s systems. Only three cosmonauts had completed a manual docking in orbit. Leonid Kizim, Yuri Malyshev, and Vladimir Dzhanibekov. Kizim had only recently returned from a long duration mission to Salyut 7, and was still undergoing rehabilitation from his spaceflight, which ruled him out as a possible candidate. Malyshev had limited spaceflight experience, and had not trained for Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA, or spacewalk), which would be required later in the mission to augment the station\u2019s solar panels, provided the rehabilitation of the space station went well.[1]\n This left Dzhanibekov, who had flown in space four times for a week or two each time, but had trained for long duration missions and for EVA. However, he was restricted from long duration flight by the medical community. Being at the top of the short list for mission commander, Dzhanibekov was quickly placed into the care of physicians who, after several weeks of medical tests and evaluation, cleared him for a flight lasting no more than 100 days. [1]\n To fulfill the role of flight engineer the list was even shorter: just one person. Victor Savinikh had flown once before, on a 74 day mission to Salyut 6. During that mission he played host to Dzhanibekov and Mongolia\u2019s first cosmonaut as they visited the station on Soyuz 39. Moreover, he was already in the process of training for the next long-duration mission to Salyut 7, which had been scheduled to launch on May 15, 1985. [1]\n By the middle of March, the crew had been firmly decided. Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Victor Savinikh were chosen to attempt one of the boldest, most complicated in-space repair efforts to date. [1]\n  On June 6, 1985, nearly four months after contact with the station had been lost, Soyuz T-13 launched with Vladimir Dzhanibekov as commander and Victor Savinikh as flight engineer. [1],[6] After two days of flight, the station came into view.\n As they approached the station, live video from their ship was being transmitted to ground controllers. To the right\u00a0is one of the images controllers saw.\n The controllers noticed something very wrong: the station\u2019s solar arrays weren\u2019t parallel. This indicated a serious failure in the system which orients the solar panels toward the sun, and immediately led to concerns about the entire electrical system of the station. [1]\n  Dzhanibekov: \u201cDistance, 200 meters. Engaging engines. Approaching the station at 1.5 m/s, rotational speed of the station is normal, it\u2019s practically stable. We\u2019re holding, and beginning our turn. Oh, the sun is in a bad spot now\u2026 there, that\u2019s better. Docking targets aligned. Offset between the ship and the station within normal parameters. Slowing down\u2026 waiting for contact.\u201d\n Silently, slowly, the crew\u2019s Soyuz flew toward the forward docking port of the station.\n  The successful docking to the station was a great victory, and demonstrated for the first time in history that it was possible to rendezvous and dock with virtually any object in space, but it was early to celebrate. The crew received no acknowledgement, either electrical or physical, from the station of their docking. One of the main fears about the mission, that something else would go seriously wrong while the station was out of contact, was quickly becoming a reality.\n A lack of information on the crew\u2019s screens about the pressure inside the station led to concerns that the station had de-pressurized, but the crew pressed ahead, carefully. Their first step would be to try to equalize the pressure between the ship and the station, if possible.

", "note_en": "The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a range of disease phenotypes in infected patients with asymptomatic, mild, or severe clinical outcomes, but the mechanisms that determine such variable outcomes remain unresolved. In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.\n     Uncovering the immunological responses to COVID-19 infection will help in designing and developing next-generation therapies and manage the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients. Many host factors associated with mild or severe disease symptoms have been reported. For example, leukopenia, exhausted CD8 T-cells, higher levels of T H2 cytokines in serum, a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, blunted interferon response, dysregulation of the myeloid cell compartment, activated NK cells, and the size of the na\u00efve T-cell compartment is associated with critically ill patients  1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This wide range of variable factors shares a common immunological underpinning\u2014that of a systemic dysregulation in immune homeostasis due to the failure of the host immune system to clear the virus during the early stages of the infection  6. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that susceptibility to respiratory virus infections is associated with compromised CD8 T-cell immunity  7, 8, 9, 10, 11. A delay in the activation of CD8 T-cells and a lack of early IFN-\u03b3 production by the innate immune arm leads to an increase in viral load triggering overactivation of the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system leading to a loss of immune homeostasis resulting in severe disease phenotype, including death. Therefore, an early wave of strong CD8 T-cell response may delay viral titer build-up, allowing rapid clearance of the virus by the immune system without perturbing immune homeostasis.\n Healthy humans not exposed to COVID-19 show pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens  12, 13, 14. The pre-existing immunity to CD4 and CD8 T-cells was detected against structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins by overlapping 15-mer peptide pools. The existence of a pool of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in unexposed individuals is thought to arise from coronaviruses that cause common cold  13, 15, 16. Whether pre-existing immunity provides any protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection or contributes to a faster recovery from infection remains speculative. Besides, it is unclear whether a pre-existing immunity, involving either CD4 or CD8 T-cells, or both, is required for maximal protection. Identifying robust pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the healthy population can be used as a measure to assess the mode of recovery and also viral spread in the global population.\n In this study, we identified strong CD8 T-cell-activating epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by a combination of epitope prediction and T-cell activation assays in healthy donors unexposed to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale for identifying epitopes that favor CD8 T-cell activation was twofold. First, robust CD8 T-cell activating epitopes can be formulated as second-generation vaccines for short and long-term protection against viral infection. Second, detection of pre-existing immunity in healthy donors using epitopes that favor CD8 T-cell activation may provide a framework to understand the complex immune responses observed in clinical settings. It may also shed light on the differences in morbidity and mortality in different population groups across the globe.\n We developed a proprietary algorithm OncoPeptVAC to predict CD8 T-cell activating epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. OncoPeptVAC predicts binding of the HLA-peptide complex to the T-cell receptor (TCR). We selected a cocktail of eleven 15-mer peptides with a broad class-I and class-II coverage and favorable TCR engagement predicted by the algorithm. The cocktail of peptides was tested for T-cell activation in healthy donors from the USA and India unexposed to COVID-19. We observed higher CD8 T-cell activation by the 11-peptide pool compared to the overlapping 15-mer peptide pools from the spike-S1 and S2 proteins. Homology analysis of the selected peptides with other coronavirus spike proteins indicated a lack of significant amino acid identity with any of the 11 peptides, suggesting engagement of one or more peptides in the pool to cross-reactive TCRs from other viruses, not particularly from a coronavirus. Bulk and single-cell TCR analysis revealed expanded clonotypes recognizing epitopes from CMV, Influenza-A, and other viruses to which most of us are exposed. Taken together, our findings support that strong pre-existing CD8 T-cell immunity in unexposed donors is contributed by cross-reactive TCRs from other viruses. Significantly, we discovered multiple immunodominant epitopes in our predicted pool of peptides that favored CD8 T-cell activation. Finally, we show that our cocktail of 11-peptides induced a robust immune response in convalescent patients demonstrating that these peptides are recognized by infected patients. Taken together, our study uncovered strong pre-existing CD8 T-cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 using a small set of 11 epitopes that engaged cross-reactive TCRs recognizing epitopes from other viruses, not necessarily common cold viruses belonging to the coronavirus family as hypothesized by other studies. Additionally, our findings raise the possibility that many individuals carrying antigen-experienced T-cells against other viruses may be naturally protected against COVID-19 without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n A deep CNN model OncoPeptVAC was implemented to predict the immunogenicity of peptides based only on the peptide and HLA sequences. A total of 8870 immunogenic and non-immunogenic peptide-HLA pairs were obtained from the IEDB  17. The BLOSUM encoding was used to represent the peptide and HLA molecules. The BLOSUM substitution scores encode evolutionary and physicochemical properties of the amino acids  18. In addition, hydrophobicity indices and predicted HLA binding scores were also used to represent the peptide and HLA sequences.\n OncoPeptVAC used the CNN model with multiple 2D convolutional layers combined with max-pooling to confirm the additive effect of different input features on the performance of the model. All the model versions were trained using fivefold cross-validation. The AUC of the final model was 0.87 based on a blind test dataset (Fig.\u00a0 1A). The prediction algorithm showed a sensitivity of 0.64 and a specificity of 0.84 based on the score cut-off of 0.2 (Fig.\u00a0 1B). By increasing the cut-off score to 0.5, the specificity could be further increased to 96.8 with a concomitant loss in sensitivity. OncoPeptVAC reduced the number of false positives significantly compared to the HLA-binding rank (Compare Fig.\u00a0 1B,C) reducing the number of epitopes by 30% that needed to be screened in a T-cell activation assay to identify true immunogenic epitopes. For example, to identify 50% (119 out of 238) of the immunogenic peptide-HLA pairs present in the blind test dataset, 256 top peptide-HLA pairs from OncoPeptVAC prediction needed to be screened, compared to 753 top peptide-HLA pairs predicted by netMHCpan-4.0.\n Identification of immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 by OncoPeptVAC. ( A) ROC curves of OncoPeptVAC TCR-binding and netMHCpan-4.1 HLA binding algorithms. A blind dataset of non-immunogenic or immunogenic HLA class-I binding T-cell epitopes from IEDB was used to assess the performance of OncoPeptVAC (cyan). The HLA-binding affinity of the epitopes expressed as percentile rank\u2009&lt;\u20091% was used to assess the performance of netMHCpan-4.1 in predicting true immunogenic epitopes (orange).

( F) HLA-A, B and C-restricted epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteome.\n The prediction algorithm was applied to the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and screened against 23 class-I HLAs covering over 98% of the world population. A schematic of the in silico screening approach is shown in Fig.\u00a0 1D. Briefly, 9\u201311-mer peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were screened for TCR-binding against 23 HLA, and peptides with OncoPeptVAC score\u2009&gt;\u20090.2 were analyzed for class-I HLA binding. Peptide-HLA pairs with a high predicted binding affinity (&lt;\u20091 percentile rank) were selected, their length extended to 15-mer, and screened for class-II HLA binding (See \u201c Methods\u201d for details). Peptides with favorable TCR binding and class-I/II HLA binding features were selected for further validation. The number of predicted immunogenic epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 protein-coding genes is shown in Fig.\u00a0 1E. The distribution of OncoPeptVAC scores against different class-I HLA genes indicates a higher number of favorable TCR-binding peptides for HLA-B and C compared to HLA-A (Fig.\u00a0 1F). Natural biases in HLA restrictions have been reported for immunogenic HIV epitopes  19.\n  We performed T-cell activation assay using a set of 11 prioritized epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (Table  1) in unexposed donors. We selected epitopes from the spike antigen because it is highly immunogenic and generates strong B and T-cell responses. Besides, identifying strong immunogenic epitopes from the spike antigen can become useful reagents to study mechanisms of immune toxicity, and for long-term immune monitoring studies in na\u00efve and vaccinated populations. The 15-mer peptides contained in the 11 selected epitopes cover different segments of the RBD and the non-RBD regions of the spike antigens and few peptides harbor ACE2 receptor binding sites (Fig.\u00a0 2A and Table  1). Many of the predicted peptides reside in flexible regions of the spike protein that could favor efficient processing and presentation. Only two out of the 11 peptides showed 100% identity to the 315 peptides present in the spike-S1 and S2 pools obtained from a commercial vendor (Table  2) (See the \u201c Methods\u201d section for the creation of the peptide pool).\n  T-cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide pools and OncoPeptVAC prioritized peptides. Reactivity was determined by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining and surface expression of 4-1BB by FACS after stimulation of PBMCs from unexposed donors (n\u2009=\u200914) using separate pools of Spike-S1 and S2 peptides and the 11-Peptide-mix predicted by OncoPeptVAC (see \u201c Methods\u201d).

( G,H) CD8 T-cell response of donors D167 and D089 to individual peptides from the 11-peptide-mix. Statistical significance determined by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test in Figures ( B- E).\n  We screened PBMCs from 14 unexposed donors from the US collected between 2016\u20132018 and India (2015\u20132017), much before SARS-CoV-2 was recognized as a global pandemic (Table- S1). Activation of T-cells using the cocktail of 11 peptides (All-peptide mix) was compared to the responses from Spike-S1 (157 peptides) and S2 (158 peptides) pools (see \u201c Methods\u201d for assay details). At 48\u00a0h, the All peptide-mix induced a strong IFN-\u03b3 response in CD8 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2B left panel), and a weaker response in CD4 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2C, left panel). The IFN-\u03b3 response by the All peptide-mix was stronger in CD8 T-cells, compared to responses from spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools (Fig.\u00a0 2B, left panel). The 4-1BB response in both cell types was weaker at 48\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a0 2B,C right panels). IFN-\u03b3 levels increased in CD8 T-cells at day-7 by the All-peptide mix compared to the Spike peptide pools (Fig.\u00a0 2C, left panel). The higher expression of IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB in the CD4 and CD8 T-cells in certain donors at\u00a07-day suggested de novo activation (Fig.\u00a0 2D,E). At 48\u00a0h, 70% of the unexposed donors showed\u2009&gt;\u20090.5% IFN-\u03b3 response in CD8 T-cells to the predicted peptide mix suggesting recall to pre-existing antigen-experienced CD8 T-cells (Fig.\u00a0 2F). In most donors, the maximal response was detected by 7-days, but in donors D142 and D176 the response peaked at 48\u00a0h and declined thereafter (Fig.\u00a0 2F). Although the use of 15-mer peptides is expected to skew the response towards CD4 T-cells, we observed a stronger CD8 T-cell response to the Peptide-mix suggesting that the 15-mer peptide though added exogenously, was processed and presented by class-I HLAs efficiently. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the use of OncoPeptVAC identified potent CD8 T-cell epitopes in the spike antigen that could not have been detected by using large overlapping peptide pools used in T-cell activation assays.\n Next, we tested individual peptides from the mix to assess their contribution to T-cell activation. The magnitude and kinetics of IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB induction in CD8 T-cells by individual peptides were variable in different donors (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1,  S2). Peptide-7 was an exceptionally strong CD8 T-cell epitope inducing IFN-\u03b3 in 3 out of 7 donors (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Supplementary Figure  S1E). Most immunogenic epitopes activated CD8 T-cells at 48\u00a0h and achieved\u2009&gt;\u20092% activation by 7-day. The early activation at 48\u00a0h suggested that these epitopes engaged pre-existing T-cell immunity in the unexposed donors. However, activation at day-7 could come from both pre-existing and na\u00efve T-cells. In many donors, a strong CD4 T-cell response was detected by individual peptides (Figure  S3-4). Interestingly, in many donors, both IFN-\u03b3 and 4-1BB expression was induced by multiple individual peptides, although the magnitude of response by the All-peptide mix was not always additive (compare donor responses to the All peptide mix, Fig.\u00a0 2F, with responses to individual peptides, Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1 for IFN-\u03b3 and Figure  S2A with S2B-H for 4-1BB) confirming that the T-cell activation potential of individual peptides could be masked, when present as a part of a larger peptide pool.\n Multiple studies have reported pre-existing T-cell immunity in unexposed donors using spike peptide pools and attributed the response to T-cells recognizing epitopes from common cold-causing coronaviruses to which a large section of the global population is exposed  12, 13, 15. Homology analysis of the selected epitopes (see \u201c Methods\u201d) indicated that 6 out of the 11 peptides share\u2009&gt;\u200967% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and only 1 (Peptide-11) out of the 11 peptides has over 70% identity with multiple coronaviruses (Table  3). Peptide-11 is in the S2 domain of the spike protein and showed\u2009\u2265\u20091% CD8 T-cell response at 48\u00a0h in 1 out of 7 donors tested (D167, Fig.\u00a0 2G). However, peptides 3, 6, 7, and 9 lacking significant identity to other coronaviruses (Table  3) showed\u2009\u2265\u20091% CD8 T-cell activation at 48\u00a0h in at least one donor out of 7 (Fig.\u00a0 2G,H and Figure  S1). Peptide-7 induced high CD8 T-cell activation at 48\u00a0h in two donors (D089 and D225 (Fig.\u00a0 2F and Figure  S1E). Taken together, the data suggest that pre-existing T-cell immunity to these peptides may be derived from cross-reactive TCRs recognizing other viruses.\n   To identify CDR3s amplified by individual peptides, or the All-peptide-mix, bulk TCR analysis was performed on antigen-stimulated PBMCs from donors D089 and D225 at days 7, 14, and 21 post-stimulation with antigens (see \u201c Methods\u201d). Both donors showed a robust IFN-\u03b3 response to Pep-7, and the Pep-Mix, but not to Pep-1 (Figure  S4). Diversity and clonal amplification of unique public and private CDR3s were analyzed at three different time points (Fig.\u00a0 3A,B). Both the donors showed clonal expansion of multiple public CDR3s recognizing HCMV, human herpes virus-5 (HHV-5), and Influenza-A peptides when stimulated with Pep-7 and All-peptide mix, but not with Pep-1 (Table  S2). HCMV and HHV-5 CDR3s were expanded in donor D089 (Fig.\u00a0 3A, top panel), whereas D225 showed expansion of HCMV and Influenza-A CDR3s (Fig.\u00a0 3A, bottom panel). Significantly, these CDR3s were not amplified by Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools or by Pep-1, the latter failed to activate T-cells in these donors. Further, CDR3s recognizing HCMV peptide NLVPMVATV in donors 089 and 225 were different, suggesting that the same antigen engages multiple cross-reactive TCRs in different donors. Next, we analyzed private CDR3s in these two donors to identify novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific CDR3 (Fig.\u00a0 3B). Donor 089 showed a lack of specific amplification of private CDR3s suggesting that the robust CD8 T-cell response detected in this donor may be contributed by the amplified public CDR3s (Fig.\u00a0 3B, top panel). In contrast, two private CDR3s were clonally amplified by Pep-7 and All-peptide mix in D225 suggesting that the T-cell response is derived from both public and non-public TCRs in this donor (Fig.\u00a0 3B, bottom panel). Given that the TCR analysis was performed on day-7 and beyond, the amplified CDR3s may be derived from both pre-existing and na\u00efve T-cells. A list of clonally amplified public and private CDR3s detected in the two donors is given in Table  S2.\n Bulk TCR repertoire analysis after in unexposed donors following in vitro stimulation of PBMCs at different time points with the indicated peptides. ( A) Expanded public CDR3-\u03b2s recognizing shared antigens in the D089 (upper panel) and D225 (lower panel). ( B) Expanded private CDR3-\u03b2s in D089 (upper panel) and D225 (lower panel). ( C) V\u2013J gene usage in D225. ( D) V\u2013J gene usage in D089.\n To further investigate the TCR repertoire profile of donors 089 and 225 we analyzed the VDJ gene usage in the bulk CDR3 data. In D225, two V segments TRVB2 and TRVB30, and a J gene TRBJ2-1 were significantly over-represented in Pep7 and Peptide-mix treated samples (Fig.\u00a0 3C), whereas in D089 TRBV12-4 and TRBJ1-2 genes were amplified (Fig.\u00a0 3D).\n  To characterize the phenotype and functional state of activated T-cells and reveal differences between the different treatments, we performed single-cell sequencing on a 10X platform. Single-cell transcriptomics and TCR data obtained from 3500\u20134500 cells identified 3000\u20133500 unique transcripts (see \u201c Methods\u201d). Using graph-based clustering of uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) we captured transcriptomes of 4 distinct cell types (Fig.\u00a0 4A and Table  S3). Our assay method is enriched for the growth and proliferation of T-cells causing depletion of other immune cell types present in PBMC in a 14-day culture. Three cell types, CD8, \u03b3/\u03b4, and NK-T were detected in all the samples. Compared to DMSO and Pep-7 in which the CD8 T-cell fraction was\u2009~\u200960%, in spike-S1 and spike-S2 the CD8 T-cell fraction was 50% and 38% respectively. Conversely, the CD4 cluster was expanded in spike-S\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 14:26:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

parent company of an online marketplace for sneakerheads, said it has raised $195 million through private investors to continue its push into international markets.\n  The latest funding round values the company at $3.7 billion, more than double its valuation when the company  raised $100 million in September.\n  The company also provided detail about its financial performance, saying $2 billion of merchandise was sold on its Goat platform over the past year. Sales of sneakers during the period doubled compared with the previous year.\n  Do you buy sneakers or apparel from Goat? If so, how have your buying habits changed over the past year? Join the conversation below.\n  Goat remains best known as a platform to buy popular or hard-to-find sneakers, and much of its success can be traced to the continued  ascendancy of sneaker and streetwear culture. Wealthy shoppers have proved willing to shell out far more than the retail price of popular styles and colorways, fueling a competitive and controversial market for buying and flipping shoes.\n    The sneaker and streetwear resale market in North America hit more than $2 billion last year, according to Cowen, which estimates that the global market could reach $30 billion by 2030.\n  Unlike competitors such as StockX LLC and  eBay    EBAY  2.00%  which  are exclusively resell platforms, Goat also sells directly from its more than 350 brand partners, including Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.\n  In 2019, the company began expanding beyond sneakers into luxury apparel and accessories. Eddy Lu, Goat Group\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview that the retailer has been careful about adding new categories to ensure the marketplace remains in line with the desires of its young customer base.\n  \u201cWe care about authenticity, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t create all of these verticals,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cWe have a point of view on fashion, culture and style.\u201d\n  The Goat customer base is young, fashionable and comfortable wearing expensive items alongside their secondhand purchases, Mr. Lu said. Of Goat\u2019s 30 million customers, 80% are millennials and Gen Zers.\n    For fashion labels concerned about preserving brand integrity, the Goat marketplace offers access to those shoppers on a more curated platform, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling their products next to  Nvidia graphics cards and batteries and things like that,\u201d Mr. Lu said.\n  International markets remain a primary target for growth, Mr. Lu said. Part of the proceeds from the latest funding round will be used to open four additional fulfillment centers this year. Three of those centers will be located in Asia, adding to three existing international facilities. The new facilities will help cut costs associated with international shipping and make shipping speeds more competitive, he said.\n  The retailer has 13 fulfillment centers across the U.S., Europe and Asia, where it checks the authenticity and quality of resale merchandise before shipping it to customers.\n  Goat Group, which was founded in 2015, previously raised about $300 million over multiple fundraising rounds, with past investors including D1 Capital Partners LP, Accel, Upfront Ventures and retailer  Foot Locker    FL  3.63%  The latest funding round was led by Park West Asset Management LLC.\n  Appeared in the June 25, 2021, print edition as &#39;Goat Group Valued at $3.7 Billion.&#39;", "posttime": "2021-06-26 13:02:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5c71\u7f8a,goat,\u8fd0\u52a8\u978b", "title": "\u5c71\u7f8a\u96c6\u56e2\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8fd0\u52a8\u978b\u5e02\u573a\u5c71\u7f8a\u7684\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4f30\u4ef7\u4e3a3.7\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e0a\u6da82\u500d\uff0c\u5f53\u516c\u53f8\u57289\u6708\u7b79\u96c6100\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "GOAT Group, parent company of online sneaker marketplace GOAT, raises $195M Series F at a valuation of $3.7B, up 2x when the company raised $100M in September", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goat-group-parent-of-sneaker-marketplace-valued-at-3-7-billion-in-latest-funding-round-11624532400?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5c71\u7f8a", "goat", "\u8fd0\u52a8\u978b"]}]
