The police had identified him using facial recognition software, even though he was 30 miles away at the time of the incident.</p><p>2019年2月，尼耶·帕克斯（Nijeer Parks）被指控在纽约州伍德布里奇的汉普顿酒店（Hampton Inn）盗窃糖果并试图用汽车殴打警务人员。尽管当时他在30英里外，警察还是使用面部识别软件对其进行了识别。事件。</p><p> Mr. Parks spent 10 days in jail and paid around $5,000 to defend himself. In November 2019, the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.</p><p> 帕克斯先生被判入狱10天，并支付了大约5,000美元为自己辩护。 2019年11月，该案因缺乏证据而被驳回。</p><p> Mr. Parks, 33,  is now suing the police, the prosecutor and the City of Woodbridge for false arrest, false imprisonment and violation of his civil rights.</p><p> 现年33岁的帕克斯先生目前正在起诉警察，检察官和伍德布里奇市，罪名是错误逮捕，错误监禁和侵犯其公民权利。</p><p> He is the third person known to be falsely arrested based on a bad facial recognition match. In all three cases, the people mistakenly identified by the technology have been Black men.</p><p> 他是第一个因面部识别不佳而被误捕的人。在这三种情况下，被技术错误识别的人都是黑人。</p><p> Facial recognition technology is known to have flaws. In 2019, a national study of over 100 facial recognition algorithms found that  they did not work as well on Black and Asian faces. Two other Black men —  Robert Williams and  Michael Oliver, who both live in the Detroit area — were also arrested for crimes they did not commit based on bad facial recognition matches. Like Mr. Parks, Mr. Oliver  sued over the wrongful arrest.</p><p> 面部识别技术已知存在缺陷。在2019年，一项针对100多种面部识别算法的全国性研究发现，它们在黑人和亚洲面孔上效果不佳。居住在底特律地区的另外两名黑人-罗伯特·威廉姆斯和迈克尔·奥利弗也因涉嫌面部识别不佳而没有犯罪而被捕。像帕克斯先生一样，奥利弗先生也因不当逮捕而提起诉讼。</p><p> Nathan Freed Wessler, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who believes that the police should stop using face recognition technology, said the three cases demonstrated “how this technology disproportionately harms the Black community.”</p><p> 美国公民自由联盟的律师内森·弗里德·韦斯勒（Nathan Freed Wessler）认为警察应该停止使用面部识别技术，他说这三起案件表明“该技术如何严重损害黑人社区。”</p><p> “Multiple people have now come forward about being wrongfully arrested because of this flawed and privacy-invading surveillance technology,” Mr. Wessler said. He worries that there have been other arrests and even mistaken convictions that have not been uncovered.</p><p> 韦斯勒先生说：“由于这种有缺陷且侵犯隐私的监视技术，现在有很多人提出要被错误逮捕。”他担心还有其他逮捕行动，甚至还有未被发现的错误信念。 </p><p> Law enforcement often defends the use of facial recognition, despite its flaws, by saying it is used only as a clue in a case and will not lead directly to an arrest. But Mr. Parks’s experience is another example of an arrest based almost solely on a suggested match by the technology.</p><p>尽管存在缺陷，但执法部门通常会辩护使用面部识别，方法是说面部识别仅用作案件的线索，不会直接导致逮捕。但是帕克斯先生的经历是另一个逮捕案件的例子，几乎完全是基于技术建议的比赛。</p><p>  On a Saturday in January 2019, two police officers showed up at the Hampton Inn in Woodbridge after receiving a report about a man stealing snacks from the gift shop.</p><p>  2019年1月的一个星期六，两名警察接到报告称一名男子从礼品店偷窃小吃后，在伍德布里奇的汉普顿酒店出现。</p><p> The alleged shoplifter — a Black man, nearly 6 feet tall, wearing a black jacket — was visiting a Hertz office in the hotel lobby, trying to get the rental agreement for a gray Dodge Challenger extended. The officers confronted him, and he apologized, according to the police report. He said he would pay for the snacks and gave the officers a Tennessee driver’s license.</p><p> 涉嫌入店行窃的是一名身高接近6英尺，身穿黑色外套的黑人男子，他正前往酒店大堂的赫兹办公室，试图获得一份延期的灰色道奇挑战者的租赁协议。根据警方的报告，警察与他面对面，他道歉。他说，他将为零食买单，并给了官员田纳西州的驾驶执照。</p><p>  When the officers checked the license, they discovered it was fraudulent. According to a police report, one of the officers spotted a “big bag of suspected marijuana” in the man’s pocket. They tried to handcuff him. That was when the man ran, losing a shoe on the way to his rental car, police said.</p><p>  当军官检查许可证时，他们发现许可证是欺诈性的。根据警方的报告，其中一名警察在该男子的口袋里发现了“一大袋可疑大麻”。他们试图给他戴上手铐。警察说，那是那人跑的时候，在去他的租车的路上丢了鞋子。</p><p> As he drove off, the man hit a parked police car and a column in front of the hotel, the police said. One of the officers said he had to jump out of the way to avoid being hit. The rental car was later found abandoned in a parking lot a mile away.</p><p> 警察说，当他开车离开时，该名男子撞到一辆停着的警车和旅馆前的一列。其中一名警官说，他必须跳开路，以免受到打击。后来发现这辆出租汽车被遗弃在一英里外的停车场中。</p><p>   A detective in the Woodbridge Police Department sent the photo from the fake driver’s license to state agencies that had access to face recognition technology, according to a police report.</p><p>   根据警方的报告，伍德布里奇警察局的一名侦探将伪造的驾照中的照片发送给了可以使用面部识别技术的州机构。</p><p> The next day, state investigators said they had a facial recognition match: Nijeer Parks, who lived in Paterson, N.J., 30 miles away, and worked at a grocery store. The detective compared Mr. Parks’s New Jersey state ID with the fake Tennessee driver’s license and agreed it was the same person. After a Hertz employee confirmed that the license photo was of the shoplifter, the police issued a warrant for Mr. Parks’s arrest.</p><p> 第二天，州立调查人员说他们参加了一次面部识别比赛：生活在30英里外的新泽西州帕特森市并在一家杂货店工作的Nijeer Parks。侦探将帕克斯先生的新泽西州身分证与假的田纳西州驾照进行了比较，并同意是同一个人。在赫兹（Hertz）的一名雇员确认驾照的照片是入店行窃的照片之后，警察发布了逮捕帕克斯先生的手令。 </p><p> “I don’t think he looks like me,” Mr. Parks said. “The only thing we have in common is the beard.”</p><p>帕克斯说：“我认为他看起来不像我。” “我们唯一的共同点是胡须。”</p><p> Mr. Parks’s mistaken arrest was first reported by  NJ Advance Media, which said the facial recognition app Clearview AI had been used in the case, based on a claim in Mr. Parks’s lawsuit. His lawyer, Daniel Sexton, said he had inferred that Clearview AI was used, given media reports about facial recognition in New Jersey, but now believes he was mistaken.</p><p> 帕克斯先生的误捕最早是由新泽西新闻媒体报道的，该新闻称，基于帕克斯先生诉讼中的一项说法，面部识别应用程序Clearview AI已用于此案。他的律师丹尼尔·塞克斯顿（Daniel Sexton）说，他已经推断出使用了Clearview AI，因为有媒体报道了新泽西州的面部识别，但现在认为他是错的。</p><p> Clearview AI is a facial recognition tool that uses billions of photos scraped from the public web, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram. Clearview AI’s founder, Hoan Ton-That, said officers affiliated with the state agencies where information was analyzed in the case, known as fusion centers, involved in the case were not using his company’s app at that time.</p><p> Clearview AI是一种面部识别工具，它使用从公共网络（包括Facebook，LinkedIn和Instagram）抓取的数十亿张照片。 Clearview AI的创始人Hoan Ton-That说，隶属于负责分析此案信息的州立机构的官员当时没有使用他公司的应用程序。</p><p> According to the police report, the match in this case was to a license photo, which would reside in a government database, to which Clearview AI does not have access. The law enforcement involved in making the match — the New York State Intelligence Center, New Jersey’s Regional Operations Intelligence Center and two state investigators — did not respond to inquiries about which facial recognition system was used.</p><p> 根据警察的报告，在这种情况下，匹配的是许可证照片，该照片位于政府数据库中，Clearview AI无法访问该数据库。参与这场比赛的执法人员-纽约州情报中心，新泽西州的地区行动情报中心和两名州调查人员-并未回答使用哪种面部识别系统的询问。</p><p> In January, after  a New York Times article about Clearview AI, New Jersey’s attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, put  a moratorium on Clearview’s use by the police and announced an investigation into “this product or products like it.” A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said that New Jersey’s Division of Criminal Justice was still evaluating the use of facial recognition products in the state, and that the development of a policy governing their use was ongoing.</p><p> 1月，在《纽约时报》发表有关Clearview AI的文章后，新泽西州检察长Gurbir S. Grewal暂停了Clearview的使用，并宣布对“这种产品或类似产品”进行调查。总检察长办公室发言人说，新泽西州刑事司法部仍在评估该州面部识别产品的使用，并且正在制定管理使用面部识别产品的政策。</p><p>  After his arrest, Mr. Parks was held for 10 days at the Middlesex County Corrections Center. New Jersey’s  no-bail system uses an algorithm that evaluates the defendant’s risk rather than money to determine whether a defendant can be released before trial.</p><p>  被捕后，帕克斯先生在米德尔塞克斯郡教养中心被关押了十天。新泽西州的免保系统使用一种算法来评估被告的风险而不是金钱，来确定是否可以在审判前释放被告。</p><p> A decade ago, Mr. Parks was arrested twice and incarcerated for selling drugs. He was released in 2016. The public safety assessment score he received, which would have taken his past convictions into account, was high enough that he was not released after his first hearing. His mother and fiancée hired an attorney, who was able to get him out of jail and into a pretrial monitoring program.</p><p> 十年前，帕克斯先生因贩毒被捕两次并被监禁。他于2016年获释。考虑到他过去的信念，他收到的公共安全评估分数非常高，以至于他在初次听证会后没有被释放。他的母亲和未婚妻聘请了一位律师，他得以将他从监狱中带出并进行了审前监视程序。 </p><p> His history with the criminal justice system is what made this incident so scary, he said, because this would have been his third felony, meaning he was at risk of a long sentence. When the prosecutor offered a plea deal, he almost took it even though he was innocent.</p><p>他说，他在刑事司法系统中的历史使这一事件如此可怕，因为这将是他的第三次重罪，这意味着他有可能被判长期监禁。检察官提出认罪协议时，即使他是无辜的，他也几乎接受了。</p><p> “I sat down with my family and discussed it,” Mr. Parks said. “I was afraid to go to trial. I knew I would get 10 years if I lost.”</p><p> 帕克斯先生说：“我和家人坐下来讨论了一下。” “我害怕去审判。我知道如果我输了，我会得到十年。”</p><p> Mr. Parks was able to get proof from Western Union that he had been sending money at a pharmacy in Haledon, N.J., when the incident happened. At his last court hearing, he told the judge that he was willing to go to trial to defend himself. But a few months later, his case was dismissed.</p><p> 帕克斯先生能够从Western Union获得证据，证明事件发生时他一直在新泽西州哈利登的一家药房汇款。在最后一次庭审中，他告诉法官，他愿意出庭为自己辩护。但是几个月后，他的案子被驳回。</p><p> Robert Hubner, the chief of the Woodbridge Police Department, declined to comment on the case because of the pending lawsuit, but said his department had not been served the complaint. The Middlesex County prosecutor’s office also declined to comment.</p><p> 伍德布里奇警察局局长罗伯特·胡伯纳（Robert Hubner）由于悬而未决的诉讼而拒绝对此案发表评论，但他说他的部门没有得到投诉。米德尔塞克斯郡检察官办公室也拒绝置评。</p><p> Mr. Parks’s lawsuit over the wrongful arrest does not yet ask for damages.</p><p> 帕克斯先生因不当逮捕而提起的诉讼尚未要求赔偿。</p><p> “I was locked up for no reason,” Mr. Parks said. “I’ve seen it happen to other people. I’ve seen it on the news. I just never thought it would happen to me. It was a very scary ordeal.”</p><p> 帕克斯先生说：“我无缘无故被关起来。” “我已经看到其他人会遇到这种情况。我在新闻中看到了。我只是从未想过会发生在我身上。这是一次非常可怕的考验。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html#click=https://t.co/8xMMA2qM0u">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html#click=https://t.co/8xMMA2qM0u</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/缺陷/">#缺陷</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facial/">#facial</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/先生/">#先生</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
