Seafood or intelligent marine life?\n A group of Conservative MPs think it&#39;s the latter and argue they should be included in a law to protect animals.\n The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill recognises animal sentience - which is the capacity of animals to have feelings, including pain and suffering.\n It currently says fish, and other vertebrates which feel pain, should be protected as much as possible.\n Animals like lobsters and octopus are not currently protected by the bill because as invertebrates, their body is different to ours, so they aren&#39;t thought to have those complex feelings, says a report by the  Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF).\n  The report says arguments against recognising these species focuses on physical differences between these animals and humans - but this fails to understand what it means for an animal to have feelings.\n   It says those species &#34;undoubtedly experience the world in extremely different ways to ourselves,&#34; but what matters is whether they feel pleasure and pain.\n  &#34;Animals have helped us quite a lot, so we should return the favour and help them,&#34; marine biologist Emily Sullivan tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n The 25-year-old manages the research aquarium at the Marine Biological Association, which means she&#39;s worked with lots of invertebrates such as octopus, lobster, crabs, crayfish and cuttlefish.\n She feels they should be recognised in the bill - which is currently in the House of Lords.\n  There are already regulations around using animals in scientific research, including octopus and squid - though not all species.\n &#34;The aim of that is to minimise pain, stress and suffering in research,&#34; Emily says.\n  &#34;I personally do think they can recognise and feel pain, so should be protected more.&#34;\n Having interacted with lots of these species, Emily feels they are self-aware and understand what&#39;s around them.\n &#34;It definitely varies between species, and it&#39;s not the same level for all of them. But for example cuttlefish, related to octopus, are very intelligent,&#34; she says.\n &#34;The ones we have here, when you walk past their tank they come up and have a look, see what you&#39;re doing and definitely respond. You can see them watching you.&#34;\n  Emily feels it&#39;s clear when they feel pain or suffering &#34;because their behaviour changes a lot&#34;.\n &#34;They become quite lethargic and their appetite changes. That&#39;s true for a lot of the animals, including crabs and lobsters.&#34;\n  Emily says including them in the bill will have a big impact on the animals themselves because &#34;they aren&#39;t really protected or regulated much&#34;.\n The report found the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million of species such as squid, octopus, crabs and lobsters each year, and says &#34;with so many individuals at stake&#34;, it&#39;s important to be cautious even if there&#39;s not complete certainty these animals are sentient.\n  The new animal welfare legislation will mean any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy.\n That will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.\n A spokeswoman from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs told Newsbeat the UK was &#34;proud to have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world&#34;.\n &#34;We are fully committed to strengthening them further to ensure all animals avoid any unnecessary pain, distress or suffering,&#34; she said.\n She added there is already a review on the feelings of species such as octopus, cuttlefish and squid and the government will &#34;carefully consider the results&#34; of this.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:02:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ae0\u9c7c,octopuses,\u52a8\u7269", "title": "MPS\uff1a\u7ae0\u9c7c\u611f\u5230\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "MPs: Octopuses feel pain and need legal protection", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-57528249", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ae0\u9c7c", "octopuses", "\u52a8\u7269"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067025, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "zsync\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u4f20\u8f93\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u60a8\u4ece\u8fdc\u7a0b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u60a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6709\u65e7\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u526f\u672c\u3002 zsync\u4ec5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0ersync\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679crsync\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u540c\u6b65\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u5219Zsync\u4e13\u4e3a\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u53d1\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5668\u3002 Zsync\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8f6f\u4ef6 -

It allows you to download a file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as  rsync. However, where rsync is designed for synchronising data from one computer to another within an organisation, zsync is designed for file distribution, with one file on a server to be distributed to thousands of downloaders. zsync requires no special server software \u2014 just a web server to host the files \u2014 and imposes no extra load on the server, making it ideal for large scale file distribution.\n zsync is  open source, distributed under version 2 of the Artistic License. Feedback, bugs reports and patches are welcome.\n  zsync fills a gap in the technology available for large-scale file distribution. Three key points explain why zsync provides a genuinely new technique for file distribution:\n \u2014 zsync uses the rsync algorithm, but runs it on the client side, thus avoiding the high server load associated with rsync.\n \u2014 zsync provides transfers that are nearly as efficient as rsync -z or cvsup, without the need to run a special server application. All that is needed is an HTTP/1.1-compliant web server. So it works through firewalls and on shared hosting accounts, and gives less security worries.\n \u2014 rsync is ineffective on compressed files, unless they are compressed with a patched version of gzip. zsync has special handling for gzipped files, which enables update transfers of files which are distributed in compressed form.\n The special handling of compressed files is, as far as I know, entirely new and unique to zsync. The combination of client-side rsync and HTTP is also unique to zsync, to the best of my knowledge.\n I have put up  technical papers. There is a current paper, which reflects zsync&#39;s latest development, and which I update with new figures as I run new tests and comparisons; there are also older snapshots of the technical paper, included for reference and citation.\n  zsync is only useful if people offer zsync downloads. I have made a deliberate effort to make zsync simple and reliable in use, and easy to deploy.\n \u2014 zsync downloads are offered by building a .zsync file, which contains the meta-data needed by zsync. This file contains the precalculated checksums for the rsync algorithm; it is generated on the server, once, and is then used by any number of downloaders.\n \u2014 .zsync files have a simple text header, so they can be edited with any good editor to change details like the download URL.\n \u2014 The .zsync contains either a relative URL to the full content of the file, so you can either generate and offer it on the same server as hosts the full download (and so it can be distributed like any other file onto mirror sites). Or it can contains one or more absolute URLs (the client will try multiple URLs if necessary to find the content), meaning the .zsync can be hosted on a different server entirely; in fact, the .zsync can be generated and offered by a third party, while still leaving most of the download to the original distribution site.\n Because zsync is a file distribution method, it is useful only when people offer .zsyncs for downloads. It&#39;s a little hard to demonstrate the program and build up a user base because of this. So I am suggesting a number of uses for zsync on the  client page; these include some zsync downloads that I am offering downloads myself to give some immediate use to the program.\n If you are a server operator looking to use zsync for file distribution, see the  server page, which gives some guidance on how to create and offer .zsync files.\n  I am fairly happy with how zsync works so far, but I am still open to new ideas and optimisations. I have made sure that the format is fairly extensible in a compatible way; I expect that users of the current version of zsync will not experience compatibility problems with later versions for the foreseeable future.\n I am also looking to freeze the interface between the zsync library and thecurrent command-line client; I will at some point split zsync into a dynamiclibrary, which implements the format and allows it to be embedded into otherprograms, and the client program. This to some extent depends on whether anyoneis interested in embedding zsync into other programs; if I don&#39;t hear of anyoneintending to do so, this might wait until I have a use for it myself.\n I am interested in  hearing feedback about zsync. Bugs, crashes, and feature suggestions are welcome. Perhaps most of all I am interested in hearing about uses of zsync: I would like to hear about any serious use of zsync, because knowing how people are using it will affect which features I work on. If there are features that you need to enable a particular use, then I would like to hear about that too, particularly anyone that is interested in using zsync as a library as part of a larger program; please note that support for multiple files has already been asked about many times, but due to lack of time I am not likely to work on this in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:01:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7b97\u6cd5,\u4e0b\u8f7d,differential,zsync", "title": "zsync\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528rsync\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728http\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5dee\u5206\u6587\u4ef6\uff082010\uff09 ", "title_en": "Zsync: Differential file downloading over HTTP using the rsync algorithm (2010)", "transed": 1, "url": "http://zsync.moria.org.uk/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7b97\u6cd5", "\u4e0b\u8f7d", "zsync"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cf6f68a0d14132c82f7a2fd3ce349ff6.jpg", "infoid": 1067024, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u867d\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b -

Once seen as a liberatory technology that would usher in an era of creativity and new connections across the globe, many - from casual Twitter users to  professional content creators - have turned on the technology.\nYou can get a sense of the shift in mood from our media output: There&#39;s Netflix&#39;s popular, dystopian reality show &#34; The Circle,&#34; in which contestants cynically compete for money using often fake internet personas. One of the streaming site&#39;s most popular documentaries in the last year was &#34; The Social Dilemma,&#34; which captured viewers&#39; attention with its explanations of Facebook&#39;s privacy faux-pas. And even some of the most buzzed-about novels this year are about the darker sides of the internet, like Lauren Oyler&#39;s &#34; Fake Accounts,&#34; and Patricia Lockwood&#39;s &#34; No One Is Talking About This .&#34; We&#39;re all re-analyzing our relationship to the internet for good reason, but we&#39;ve misclassified what this relationship really is. It&#39;s not like a bad relationship, where you can just walk away, and it&#39;s not like junk food, where you can decide to eat less - it&#39;s an all-encompassing technology, our main economic engine, the tool we are forced to use to meet others and mediate our entire lives.    A solution to our current internet-use crisis cannot come at an individual level anymore than one person quitting their job would solve capitalism&#39;s poor working conditions. If we want any hope of making the internet less stressful, less back-breaking, and more fulfilling, content creators, gig economy workers, and even casual internet users need to push for a systemic solution.  A growing body of evidence suggests that the internet really is terrible for us. A  2018 study of college students found that limiting social media use to 10 minutes a day significantly reduced anxiety in its participants. A  2019 study found that teens who spent more time online were more likely to have mental health conditions.  Other studies find that social media users end up feeling more lonely, more isolated, and less self confident.\nA veritable cottage industry has cropped up to capitalize on people&#39;s knowledge that the internet is bad for them. The web is littered with how-tos on taking a break from social media, and self-help books have been written encouraging us to unplug. There are  several popular TED Talks from former internet engineers and executives telling people that the internet is bad for them and they should leave social media behind.  Retreats for the wealthy which forbid phones and computers have cropped up, and, perhaps most worryingly, the very people who build this technology are  sending their kids to schools where the technology is banned - a tacit admission of its potential to harm people&#39;s minds.        We&#39;re constantly reminded that the internet is bad for us and yet social media use is as high as it&#39;s ever been,  averaging 145 minutes per person per day globally. We&#39;re stuck in a cycle where we know something is bad, we want to stop, and yet, seemingly, we can&#39;t.\n We can&#39;t quit the internet because we&#39;ve conceptualized the problem all wrong. Social media is not an individual addiction that can be addressed at an individual level - it&#39;s a societal problem that needs a societal fix. We need to think of the internet less as a tool we all somehow can&#39;t stop using, and more as a factory we&#39;re required to be in. Our entire society has been reformulated around the internet, much like it was centered around the factory during the Industrial Revolution. If there&#39;s an  Amazon Web Services outage, much of our society stops functioning. Without the internet, we couldn&#39;t find jobs, or, at this point, even friends.     The &#34;gig economy&#34; - the often  underpaid and  exploitative labor performed by Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers - was enabled by the internet, and now  more than a quarter of workers in the US participate in this economy in some form. During the pandemic, office workers were only able to fulfil their required job duties through the internet, and college students forked over full tuition for the privilege of staring at Zoom for hours each day.\n We&#39;re all required to be here - online - for our livelihoods. But even when we&#39;re not required to be here, companies attempt to make sure we still are: App and game developers  use the same science that keeps people playing the slots in Las Vegas to keep us glued to our screens.\nAs culture and media theorist McKenzie Wark  writes in her book &#34;Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?&#34;, the internet uses our labor without us really knowing it. Unlike the broadcast era of media, during which the owners of television networks and movie studios had to at least create the content to sell to us, we now create all the content for each other, mostly without being paid.     &#34;[Social media companies like Facebook] don&#39;t even bother to provide any entertainment,&#34; Wark writes. &#34;We have to entertain each other, while they collect the rent, and they collect it on all social media time, public or private, work or leisure, and (if you keep your FitBit on) even when you sleep.&#34;\n We produce the memes, tweets, posts, and pictures that keep us tethered to the internet, and then that  content is monetized in the form of advertisements - revenue users help produce, but do not usually see a penny of.\nAlthough a very select number of internet users  can get paid for their labor - i.e.  influencers or popular YouTubers - most of us do not. If the internet is a factory, it is one in which the vast majority of people are not getting paid. Instead, users often fight with each other for non-monetary payment  in the form of clout - recognition that we can produce the most and best content for free.   &#34;In some quarters [of society], this affective currency has replaced the wages of industrialization, especially for professionals who used to earn a structured living from paid content and who now disseminate their bylines far and wide in hopes of securing a niche livelihood from name recognition,&#34; the sociologist Andrew Ross  writes. This free or cheap labor has widened income inequality massively, according to some theorists. We fight for followers, retweets, and likes, all for free, while the platforms we&#39;re on profit massively. And only a few, large companies are collecting these profits;  almost 70% of all digital ad spending goes to either Google, Facebook, or Amazon.\nAs Yasha Levine writes in his book &#34; Surveillance Valley,&#34; the internet was never meant to be a place friendly to the average user - it was developed by the US military to spy on people during wars, and then used to spy on Americans at home too. Some of Google&#39;s initial funding  came from grants from US spy agencies. When the infrastructure of the internet was sold off by the US government to private companies, the people who stood to profit off that privatization funded magazines, advertisements, and lobbying to reframe the internet from a surveillance tool to one that could liberate us culturally. As detailed by Levine, Louis Rossetto - the founder of Wired Magazine, the biggest megaphone for evangelizing the new, privatized internet in the 1990s - was an Ayn Rand fan who believed the internet would come to replace the need for a government.     Today we live in this libertarian vision of the internet in which companies exist largely unregulated, undertaxed, and able to do what they want without worry that the government will interfere.\n But now, more people seem to be seeing through the hype. So, the question now is what to do with this new, collective revelation.If the internet is somewhat like a factory, perhaps we should treat it like one. In 2014, the artist Laurel Ptak created a manifesto called  Wages for Facebook in which she argued that Facebook should pay users for their content:     &#34;They say it&#39;s friendship. We say it&#39;s unwaged work. With every like, chat, tag or poke our subjectivity turns them a profit. They call it sharing. We call it stealing.&#34;\n Though Ptak&#39;s work is a piece of art, not a  strategy for changing the web, it could be a starting point. Perhaps we as internet users can organize to stop giving away our hearts and minds for free so that a select few can profit off of them. Just as labor organizers have pushed to make other industries less exploitative, perhaps we need a movement to do the same with the internet.\nAs Levine writes, in 1969, hundreds of students at Harvard gathered to protest the university&#39;s involvement in the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet.

It\u2019s a glitchy, 10-year-old underdog of a game with a cult following of programmers, engineers, astronaut candidates, and your typical lay explosion enthusiasts, and it has a unique and active community of modders who\u2019ve been fixing bugs, adding new features, and generally keeping the game fresh for nearly a decade.\n In the game, you are the omniscient director of a space program composed of literal little green men (and beloved little green woman Valentina Kerman\u2014we see you, trailblazer) that you send skyward in spacecraft of your own design. It often feels like watching those blurry old videos of rockets launching only to come straight back down in an explosion of fiery schadenfreude: you feel a little bit frightened, a little bit sadistic, and you really want to try it again.\n  One of the most prolific  Kerbal modders is Chris Adderley, Nertea in the game, who is an engineer at the Canadian space company  MDA by day, designing ground-based systems that retrieve data from spacecraft. But in his off time, Adderley gets into the pilot\u2019s seat himself. He started playing  Kerbal Space Program soon after its release, and in 2013 started building his first mod for the game\u2014a pack of spare parts, including a xenon fuel tank and a magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (just try saying that three times fast).\n Since then, he\u2019s designed dozens of additional mods, including a Mark IV Spaceplane and space station add-ons like centrifuges and inflatable habitats.\n \u201cI build stuff that I\u2019d like to see us as a species build in the future,\u201d says Adderley.\n Recently, Addlerley decided to take some of the most plausible far-future theoretical rocket engine concepts and build them in the game\u2014introducing a way for gamers to try out these sci-fi  concepts in a simulated environment that can teach us how they might actually work, on a more practical level, in the future.\n    Adderley combed through dozens of scientific papers that outlined theoretical blueprints for these ultra-advanced propulsion systems, looking for those that were most realistic.\n \u201cEverybody tries to sell their project as the propulsion system of the future,\u201d says Adderley. \u201cYou need to kind of think a little bit critically about what people have hand waved.\u201d\n He crunched the numbers, considered how much power a specific engine would need, how to deal with the heat produced, and how you\u2019d harness the energy to propel the virtual rocket further. \u201cThat was superfun, which might be a supernerdy statement, but you know.\u201d\n In the end, he built out 13 different engine concepts, including fusion engines\u2014like   The Expanse&#39;s Epstein drive is theorized to be\u2014fission engines, and antimatter rockets.\n Though we don\u2019t yet have the technology to implement these specific-impulse demons, there is some real world value in being able to simulate advanced engines in a low-stakes environment. In fact, it\u2019s such a great sandbox that engineers at SpaceX and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have used Kerbal graphics in their presentations. In 2018,  NASA released Open MCT, a telemetry data visualization software designed for operating spacecraft, to the public on Github. It\u2019s costly and time-consuming to test these systems on real spacecraft, so some participants ran their programs through Kerbal instead.\n For Sumontro Sinha, an aerospace engineer and fusion researcher at the Propulsion Research Lab at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Kerbal is the go-to for testing out new ideas and training new engineers.\n \u201cInstead of Powerpoint slides and pages of equations, just make the ship and see how it works,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it works in Kerbal, then it has a good chance of working in real life.\u201d\n  The  spherical tokamak fusion engine is based on the fictional spaceship in   2001: A Space Odyssey, sans HAL the killer AI. Adderley found the actual science behind it in  a NASA study, in which the paper\u2019s lead author, Craig Williams, says NASA funded a number of projects focused on developing advanced propulsion systems. Williams\u2019 team designed an engine that uses the energy produced by a fusion reaction to generate thrust. Fusion occurs naturally in the interior of stars like our sun, where lightweight atoms are superheated to the point where their electrons and neutrons decouple and neutrons, normally repellant to one another, fuse together and produce massive amounts of energy. One of the biggest challenges in producing this energy on Earth is that you need a way to confine the resultant plasma and harness its power.\n    One way to do this is with a tokamak, a device that generates a donut-shaped magnetic field that keeps the superheated plasma in place. In Williams\u2019 engine prototype, this tokamak would be nearly spherical\u2014more like a donut hole. The exhaust produced would propel the vehicle to over 166,000 mph, taking passengers to Jupiter in just under 4 months. To put that into perspective, the deep space probe Voyager is traveling away from our solar system at 35,000 mph.\n When Williams\u2019 paper came out in 2001, the authors wrote that the capability to produce this type of engine might be 30 years out. Now that it\u2019s 2021, Williams is revising his estimate. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not any closer,\u201d he says. His paper came out in an era of enthusiasm for advanced propulsion, but much of that zeal has waned until recently. \u201cYou can\u2019t really make much progress when there\u2019s no active program going on, \u201c he says. \u201cUntil you start the clock again, that 30-year projection will just keep moving forward.\u201d Bummer. But in the decades between now and humanity\u2019s era of two-week Saturn vacations, you can still try out your own digital version of Williams\u2019 engine.\n  The Afterburner  fission fragment rocket engine is based on another NASA-funded engine concept study from 2011 that utilizes the energy created in nuclear reactions to propel a spacecraft forward. Reactors filled with  Americium, a highly radioactive rare material that is a byproduct of uranium-driven nuclear reactions, generate fission products that flow down a chamber. This chamber is injected with hydrogen gas, which gets intensely excited when it meets up with the fission fragments and generates a plasma that is funneled through a powerful magnetic nozzle as thrust.\n With this breakthrough, a round trip to Mars would take 292 days, including a 60-day stay on the planet. While the engine is slower overall than a fusion engine would be, it\u2019s far closer to what we\u2019re technologically capable of at present.\n \u201cThe nuclear thermal rocket is a technology that is getting developed, and it\u2019s already been demonstrated,\u201d says Jason Cassibry, who leads the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In April, DARPA  selected three contractors to demonstrate the first phase of a nuclear thermal rocket, and NASA and the DOE put out  a call for similar preliminary designs in February. Cassibry says fission fragment and nuclear pulse engines are not far behind, but they have additional engineering hurdles to face, including figuring out how to divert all that energy away from the hull of the spacecraft so it doesn&#39;t burn up in space.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 19:02:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "space,kerbal", "title":

", "note_en": "In a tumultuous time humanity looks to the ancient world for guidance and inspiration. It\u2019s a dynamic at least as old as Petrarch, the 14th-century Italian poet whose scholarship on the Greeks and Romans helped kick-start the Renaissance.\n  Paul Skallas, a 36-year-old technology lawyer and writer, has today picked up antiquity\u2019s torch. He\u2019s an evangelist for wisdom derived from the distant past: like, say, skip the mouthwash.\n \u201cEveryone tells you to do it. Your breath is clean, it feels like the right thing to do,\u201d he said during a Zoom call from Deauville, France, where he moved from New York City last fall to ride out the pandemic. \u201cAnd then you read about  higher cancer rates for people who used it, and  how it destroys good and bad bacteria, and you go, \u2018You\u2019re right, there was no mouthwash back then.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cBack then\u201d is the ancient world, from which Mr. Skallas draws an inexhaustible supply of practical lessons.\n \u201cNo breakfast,\u201d he said. \u201cBreakfast was unknown in early history, Rome, Byzantium, ancient Greece, breakfast wasn\u2019t really a thing.\u201d He\u2019s  written about the anti-breakfast positions of Plutarch and Thomas Aquinas.\n Mr. Skallas is a proponent for a lifestyle based on a relatively obscure theory called the Lindy Effect, from which he has derived his Twitter handle, LindyMan; his Substack,  The Lindy Newsletter; his podcast, \u201c Lindy Talk\u201d; and his practical philosophy of health, exercise, diet and consumer choice.\n  The Lindy Effect can be traced to a  1964 article in The New Republic called \u201cLindy\u2019s Law,\u201d by the historian Albert Goldman, who described the \u201cbald-headed, cigar-chomping know-it-alls who foregather every night at Lindy\u2019s,\u201d the diner then on Broadway known for its cheesecake, and postulated that since comedians have an exhaustible supply of good material, the \u201clife expectancy of a television comedian is proportional to the total amount of his exposure on the medium.\u201d\n Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a statistician and scholar, tweaked this idea into a broad theory of survivability in his 2012 book, \u201cAntifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.\u201d He named it the Lindy Effect: \u201cFor the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy.\u201d\n For example, a play that has run on Broadway for five years will likely stick around for five more. He concluded: \u201cThe robustness of an item is proportional to its life!\u201d\n Mr. Taleb argued that the Lindy Effect helps explain why so many seemingly earthshaking new developments end up forgotten or disproved. For example, many scientists have spent the last decade in a state of alarm about  the \u201creplication\u201d crisis: that many findings turn out not to hold up when other scientists repeat the studies.\n Inaccurate science, in other words, is constantly being published. The Lindy-conscious consumer of scientific data will take seriously only information that has held up over a period of time.\n Lindy, he wrote in  a 2017 post on Medium, cannot be fooled: \u201cThe only effective judge of things is time.\u201d\n  Mr. Skallas has long followed and read Mr. Taleb, with whom he shares a fascination with the ancient world. He even once managed to elicit a rare correction from the scholar after disproving an assertion in one of Mr. Taleb\u2019s books, which claimed the ancients did not have a word for the color blue.\n While Mr. Taleb primarily discussed the Lindy Effect as in terms of statistics and social science, Mr. Skallas has expounded at length about the practical applications of Lindy when it comes to diet, health, dating, exercise and practically everything else. He has become something of a lifestyle guru to thousands of Twitter followers and newsletter readers: think Goop or Joe Rogan by way of the Bronze Age.\n In a 2020 Substack post outlining his ideas, he wrote, \u201cLindy exists chiefly for your protection, for risk/survival strategies in the modern world,\u201d with its constant onslaught of \u201cnew products, new academic disciplines, new books, new technologies, new foods, new living arrangements, new \u2018theories\u2019 on life, new postures.\u201d\n  Lindy is not Luddism: Mr. Skallas is an avid social media user, after all. Rather, he scours the ancient world for applicable nuggets of what he calls \u201cuseful tradition,\u201d using the Lindy Effect\u2019s heuristic of older is better as a \u201cbulwark against consumerism,\u201d to sift through the \u201ctons of products coming out every day.\u201d\n \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the store, I think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at skepticism of modern commercial life.\u201d\n Mr. Skallas endorses practices with a basis in antiquity, like intermittent fasting, which appears across religious traditions and has demonstrable  health benefits (though  also detractors). \u201cYour body gets stronger through stressors, and it gets stronger through the lack of food,\u201d he said.\n He follows a diet drawn from Greek Orthodox tradition, alternating between veganism and pescatarianism (today some call this serial cycling). A tweet from his account @LindyDiet laid out further specifics: \u201cFast 2 times a week (vegan or abstain from food) and a month straight 2 times a year.\u201d\n Somewhat akin to the advocates of the paleo diet, Mr. Skallas recommends avoiding eating any foods or beverages invented in the past 500 years. This means no Beyond Beef, Monster Energy or Go-Gurt but yes to mutton, hot cross buns and the like.\n \u201cCoffee is relatively new,\u201d he said, acknowledging the arbitrariness of the cutoff. \u201cIt\u2019s 400 years old, but that\u2019s 400 years of pretty good filtering, and it\u2019s probably not bad for you.\u201d Tea merits his highest compliment: It\u2019s a \u201cdeep Lindy\u201d beverage, with thousands of years of provenance.\n Cigarettes, a 20th-century vice, are not Lindy, though tobacco is; for those who want to smoke in a \u201cLindy compatible way,\u201d he suggests a pipe.\n Mr. Skallas eschews modern exercise machines, urging his readers in a newsletter post to stick with simple weight lifting, citing Milos of Croton, the mythical Greek bodybuilder who lifted a calf daily until he could hoist the adult bull.\n \u201cBodybuilding culture is some grotesque subculture that is a product of modernity,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWorking out isn\u2019t about the muscles, but about the other systems in your body, interconnected to each other.\u201d\n Likewise he is skeptical of yoga, given that the form practiced by most Americans today was  invented in the 20th century. \u201cIs Yoga good or bad for you? I have no idea,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLindy doesn\u2019t say \u2018don\u2019t do it,\u2019 it says \u2018we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\u201d\n  Mr. Skallas, who spends his work day reading contracts, does not see himself as a self-help figure or a philosopher. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Jordan Peterson thing,\u201d he said, referring to the Canadian philosopher whose books offer advice  directed at young men. \u201cI\u2019m not into motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018Whoa, look at this.\u2019\u201d\n    Sleek midcentury modernism? \u201cAnytime you get away from fractal patterns and ornate details, it\u2019s not Lindy.\u201d\n How about sex toys? \u201cLindy,\u201d he said, adding, by way of explanation, \u201c ancient Egypt.\u201d\n The Jeffrey Epstein scandal? \u201cSome rich guy going around and doing criminal behavior and abusing people? It\u2019s pretty Lindy!\u201d\n Epstein, he pointed out, exemplified how Lindy is not a moral compass; lots of common behaviors in the ancient world would be considered abhorrent today.\n  Yet the persistence of behaviors across millenniums makes the lessons of antiquity potent. \u201cHuman nature doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he said. The ancients \u201creally did study the person and how people act, and some of it is quite good.\u201d\n Therapy, for example, is something he believes in, but not because he holds stock in the theories of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud; rather, he argued, therapy works because the therapist embodies the deep Lindy role of a sympathetic friend in the alienating modern world.\n Of course, the Lindy effect doesn\u2019t work in every domain; if you are diagnosed with cancer, seek chemotherapy, Mr. Skallas said, rather than relying on Roman medical practices. He thinks Lindy is more useful when it comes to skepticism of industrial-age consumables, like mouthwash or processed seed oils, and faddish social science, like the  debunked Myers-Briggs test.\n And ancient practices can provide powerful inchoate benefits to their practitioners, even when the exact cause and effect may be unclear at the time. In his newsletter, Mr. Skallas cited the 2016 book \u201cThe Secret Of Our Success,\u201d by Joseph Heinrich, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard.\n Mr. Heinrich researched the history of manioc, a bitter root domesticated in South America, which can be toxic if not prepared properly. In the Amazon, \u201cIndigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots,\u201d to remove cyanide.\n After the Portuguese transported manioc to West Africa in the 17th century, the root spread rapidly, but the proper processing techniques did not. \u201cEven after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa,\u201d Mr. Heinrich writes.\n  Mr. Skallas often invents new terms of art: He talks about \u201c the 4HL,\u201d or four-hour life, as in the amount of free time available to modern office workers, and of \u201c refinement culture,\u201d the smoothed-down sameness of contemporary aesthetics, exemplified by the similarity of new car designs, brand logos and urban cafe interiors.\n His most significant coinage may be \u201cLindy walk,\u201d which he came up with last year, seeking an escape from the quarantine doldrums.\n \u201cThat just basically means a stroll,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also in a lot of ancient cultures, a heavy tradition of walking, right? There\u2019s the Sabbath stroll. In Greek, it\u2019s called Volta. There\u2019s an Italian version of it. It\u2019s just walking for the sake of walking.\u201d\n In a newsletter post, Mr. Skallas cited Greek walkers \u201cfrom Diogenes wandering the world looking for an honest man to Thales stumbling into a pit while lost in thought.\u201d\n A Lindy walk isn\u2019t just a beeline from Point A to Point B; there should be no set destination, with turns made at random to stimulate the mind. \u201cAn interesting thing happened when I walked. I had thoughts popping into my head,\u201d Mr. Skallas wrote. \u201cWaves of ideas would come through. I wasn\u2019t \u2018trying\u2019 to think or even come up with an idea. It would just appear. Like magic.\u201d\n  Many of Mr. Skallas\u2019s readers began taking daily Lindy walks and posting about them on social media, and the term has now spread beyond his immediate readership.\n \u201cEssentially it\u2019s just conscious habit forming, but I think the cute name for some reason makes it more enticing and endearing,\u201d as one follower put it.\n Mr. Skallas thinks the pandemic \u2014 itself deep Lindy (\u201cthey put on a mask 500 years ago, right?\u201d) \u2014 opened people\u2019s eyes to the worldview by evoking ancient, world-historical dangers that many had felt insulated from. \u201cI think before this pandemic hit, we were living in a time of, \u2018Hey, man, we\u2019re untouchable,\u2019\u201d he said. But quarantine forced many to begin \u201cthinking about scarcity,\u201d and ask themselves, \u201cWhat is Lindy? Like, what is the stuff you need in this life?\u201d\n Vaccination was among those things, and so the next time Mr. Skallas was contacted for this article, he was in Chicago, where he\u2019d traveled for his shot. He wrote in an email that although he wasn\u2019t giving up his day job just yet, a book (very Lindy) might be in the works.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 18:55:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u751f\u6d3b,lindy,\u6797\u8fea", "title": "\u6797\u5fb7\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f ", "title_en": "The Lindy Way of Living", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/style/lindy.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u751f\u6d3b", "lindy", "\u6797\u8fea"]}]
