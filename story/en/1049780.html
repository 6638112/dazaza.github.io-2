There were endless tasks to perfect, like memorizing chemotherapy regimens, monitoring a patient during a stem cell infusion, and recognizing clinical emergencies like septic shock or hemorrhagic stroke before they progressed past the point of intervention. I quickly learned that working with cancer patients required a sharp attention to detail and an almost exhausting level of stoicism. But above all else, my greatest fear stemmed from knowing I’d eventually have a patient die under my care.</p><p>当我是一名新手肿瘤科护士时，我是一个走路，说话的焦虑症患者。有许多任务需要完善，例如记住化疗方案，在干细胞输注过程中监视患者，以及在进展超过干预点之前识别败血症性休克或出血性中风等临床紧急情况。我很快了解到，与癌症患者一起工作需要对细节的高度关注和近乎疲惫的坚忍态度。但最重要的是，我最大的恐惧来自于知道自己最终将在我的照顾下死亡。</p><p> I was overwhelmed with uncertainty and dreaded the inevitable. One day, I’d have to coordinate hospice care, communicate with distraught family members, perform post-mortem tasks, and zip a body bag shut. During my three months of orientation, I asked every experienced nurse I knew to share insights and wisdom on death and dying.  What if the person is suffering? How can I tell if someone is close to the end? What am I supposed to do once it’s over? In many cases, death is expected, and—from what I understood, reading from the tiny notepad I kept with my colleagues’ answers—my only real responsibility was to keep them comfortable while they are passing away.</p><p> 我对不确定性不知所措，对不可避免的事情感到恐惧。有一天，我必须协调临终关怀，与心烦意乱的家庭成员沟通，执行验尸任务，然后将尸体袋拉上拉链。在入职培训的三个月中，我请我认识的每位经验丰富的护士分享有关死亡和死亡的见解和智慧。如果这个人受苦了怎么办？我该如何判断某人是否接近尾声？结束后我该怎么办？在许多情况下，都可能会导致死亡，而且，据我了解，从我随同同事们回答的小记事本中读取的内容，我唯一真正的责任就是让他们过世时保持舒适。</p><p> However, sometimes death comes unexpectedly. The vital sign machine blinks its red “abnormal parameter” alarm, or the unit telemetry monitor starts beeping, or you hear a loud, gasping noise from down the hall before someone runs in and discovers the patient to be pulseless. In those cases, depending on a person’s “Code Status,” my team has to figure out what to do next. If the patient legally decided to have a warning banner on their medical record saying “Do Not Resuscitate,” we don’t intervene medically, and instead notify their family of the passing. However, if their chart has a banner saying “Full Code,” we immediately start CPR and other life saving interventions. In these situations, an emergency call is paged over the hospital loudspeakers. A team of nurses, anesthesiologists, pharmacists, doctors and advanced care providers sprint to the bedside, and so begins the carefully orchestrated task of attempting to bring someone back to life.</p><p> 但是，有时死亡会意外地到来。生命体征机闪烁其红色的“异常参数”警报，或者单元遥测监视器开始发出蜂鸣声，或者您听到有人从大厅向下传来巨大的喘气声，然后才发现患者没有脉搏。在这种情况下，根据一个人的“代码状态”，我的团队必须弄清楚下一步该怎么做。如果患者依法决定在病历上贴上警告标语“请勿复苏”，则我们不会进行医疗干预，而是将其通过通知家属。但是，如果他们的图表上标有“ Full Code”（完整代码），我们将立即开始进行CPR和其他挽救生命的干预措施。在这些情况下，医院的扬声器上会呼叫紧急呼叫。一支由护士，麻醉师，药剂师，医生和高级护理人员组成的团队冲向了床边，因此开始了精心策划的尝试，以使某人重获新生。</p><p>    In an effort to calm my anxieties, I sought comfort in reading on my days off. While browsing a bookstore, I came across a collection of prose called  Upstream. I knew nothing about the author, and truly only picked up the book because I loved the cover art. From this serendipitous discovery, I was introduced to the writer and poet Mary Oliver, and her life-changing work.</p><p>    为了平息我的焦虑，我在休假时寻求阅读的安慰。浏览书店时，我遇到了一系列散文集，称为Upstream。我对作者一无所知，并真正只选择了这本书，因为我喜欢封面艺术。从这个偶然的发现中，我被介绍给作家和诗人玛丽·奥利弗（Mary Oliver）及其改变生活的作品。</p><p>   Her prose and poetry resonated with me in such an indescribably strong way, and learning about her personal life made the experience even more meaningful. I identified with her complicated upbringing, her queerness, her love and worship of nature, but most of all, the way she used words to navigate hardship. Unsurprisingly, I was most drawn to her poems and essays on the topics of life and death. Her curiosity wove in and out of my own, and in much of my free time I found her words standing alone, like a bright neon sign, in the dark space of my wondering.</p><p>   她的散文和诗歌以一种难以形容的强烈方式与我产生了共鸣，对她个人生活的了解使这一经历变得更加有意义。我从她的成长经历，她的古怪，对自然的热爱和崇拜中发现了她的身份，但最重要的是，她使用文字来度过困难的方式。毫不奇怪，我对她有关生与死的诗歌和散文最感兴趣。她的好奇心在我自己身上来回移动，在我的大部分空闲时间里，我发现她的话像明亮的霓虹灯一样独自站立在我纳闷的黑暗空间中。</p><p>  When death comes like the hungry bear in autumn; when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse to buy me, and snaps the purse shut; when death comes like the measle-pox when death comes like an iceberg between the shoulder blades, I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering: what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?</p><p>  当死亡像秋天的饥饿熊一样来临时；当死亡来临时，从钱包里拿走所有的亮硬币买给我，然后把钱包关上；当死亡像麻疹痘痘一样来临，而死亡像肩blade骨之间的冰山一样来临时，我想好奇地走进那扇门，想知道：那座黑暗的小屋会是什么样？</p><p>  Despite my dutiful note-taking and mental preparation, the fateful day of my first patient death came to me in an unexpected way. I had been off orientation for about six months, working as a nurse for nine in total, which was a surprisingly long time to go without a Code or patient death on my floor. Even though I was growing more comfortable in my role, the pestering worries circled in my brain, tapping on the walls of the tight container I kept them in.  Will it be too overwhelming? Am I prepared? Is anyone, ever?</p><p>  尽管我尽心尽力地做笔记并做好了心理准备，但我第一例患者去世的命运却以一种意想不到的方式降临到了我。我已经偏离方向大约六个月，总共担任九个护士，这真是一段令人惊讶的长时间，因为我没有地板上的守则或患者死亡。即使我的角色变得越来越舒适，缠扰的忧虑仍在我的脑海中盘旋，敲打着我放在里面的紧容器的墙壁。会不会太压倒性的？我准备好了吗？曾经有人吗？ </p><p> …Will the garden grow, will the rivers flow in the right direction, will the earth turn as it was taught, and if not how shall I correct it?</p><p>…花园会长大吗，河流会朝着正确的方向流动吗？地球会按照所教的那样转动吗？如果没有，我该如何纠正呢？</p><p>   I was on an overnight rotation, getting ready for a stretch of multiple shifts in a row. When I came in at 6:30 pm to look up my patient assignment, my heart sank. A small summary of one patient’s daily events were highlighted on the right side of the screen, and I skimmed and scrolled to find more information:  extensive treatment history for Leukemia, now internally bleeding, multiple failed interventions, transitioning to comfort care. I found the dayshift nurse and got a report from her explaining the patient’s situation. L had extensive disease, a low platelet count, and was uncontrollably bleeding into her abdomen. That morning, a team of providers had explained to her that surgery was not an option, and that unfortunately there was nothing more that could be done.</p><p>   我在一夜之间轮换，准备好连续进行多次轮班。当我在晚上6:30进来查看我的病人任务时，我的心沉没了。屏幕右侧突出显示了一个患者的日常事件的一小部分摘要，我浏览并滚动以查找更多信息：白血病的广泛治疗史，目前内部出血，多种干预措施失败，过渡到舒适护理。我找到了日班护士，并从她那里得到了一份报告，解释了病人的情况。 L有广泛的疾病，血小板计数低，并且无法控制地渗入她的腹部。那天早上，一个医疗服务提供者团队向她解释说，手术是没有选择的，不幸的是，别无选择。</p><p>  “The last time they checked her bloodwork, her hemoglobin was unbelievably low,” the dayshift nurse started, “She looks so pale right now. I wouldn’t be surprised if it drops to 1 by the end of the night.”</p><p>  “上一次他们检查她的血液检查时，她的血红蛋白低得令人难以置信，”一日班护士开始说，“她现在脸色苍白。如果它在深夜降到1，我不会感到惊讶。”</p><p> If God exists he isn’t just butter and good luck. He’s also the tick that killed my wonderful dog Luke. Said the river: imagine everything you can imagine, then keep on going.</p><p> 如果上帝存在，他不只是黄油和好运。他也是杀死我那只好狗卢克（Luke）的the虫。河边说：想象得到您能想象得到的一切，然后继续前进。</p><p>   When I walked into the room to check on the family, I was surprised to see L sitting up in bed, smiling at me. I half expected her to be on the brink of death already, drained and unable to speak—but there she was, quietly introducing herself. I met her sister and husband, who told me they would be staying in the room overnight.</p><p>   当我走进房间去检查家人时，我很惊讶地看到L坐在床上，对我微笑。我一半希望她已经处于死亡的边缘，精疲力尽，无法说话-但是她在那里，悄悄地自我介绍。我遇到了她的姐姐和丈夫，他们告诉我他们要在房间里过夜。</p><p>  I quickly discovered L’s dynamic personality when she clearly laid out the expectations of her demise. Since hearing the news of her prognosis, she had begun to carefully and purposefully orchestrate her own dying process. She had a list of things she wanted in place, including keeping her family close by, and to be in as little pain as possible. The first mission I dedicated myself to was securing a bag of IV morphine to begin its slow drip before the night was through. She might have been terrified, as I assume anyone would be, but somehow she held up her head that night. L radiated an air of calm as I started the IV pump. She seemed at peace, sure of herself,  prepared.</p><p>  当L清楚地说明了她去世的期望时，我很快发现了L的动态人格。自从听到预后的消息后，她就开始认真，有目的地安排自己的临终过程。她列出了自己想做的事情，包括与家人保持亲密关系，并尽可能减轻痛苦。我致力于的第一个任务是固定一袋IV吗啡，以在夜幕降临时开始缓慢滴注。就像我想的那样，她可能很害怕，但是那天晚上她不知何故抬起了头。当我启动IV泵时，L散发出平静的空气。她似乎很安心，确信自己已经准备好了。</p><p>  As the hours passed and L became too lethargic to keep up conversation, I spent more time talking with her husband and sister. Her sister told me stories about L’s life, her personality, her love of reading; and at one point mentioned that she wanted to read to L while she slept. We struck up a conversation about creative writing and poetry, and found we had similar taste. L’s sister pulled out her phone to take note of my recommendations. The first poem that came to mind was “Don’t Hesitate,” by Mary Oliver of course.</p><p>  随着时间的流逝，L变得昏昏欲睡，无法继续交谈，我花了更多时间与她的丈夫和妹妹交谈。她的姐姐告诉我有关L的生活，性格和对读书的热爱的故事；有一次提到她想在睡觉时朗读L。我们进行了有关创意写作和诗歌的对话，发现我们有相似的品味。 L的姐姐掏出手机，记下了我的建议。我想到的第一首诗当然是玛丽·奥利弗（Mary Oliver）的《不要犹豫》（Do n't Hesitate）。 </p><p> If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, don’t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that’s often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, don’t be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb.</p><p>如果您突然感到意外的喜悦，请不要犹豫。屈服于它。有很多人的生活和整个城镇被摧毁或将要被摧毁。我们不是聪明人，也不是很善良。而且绝不能赎回很多东西。尽管如此，生活还有一些可能性。也许这就是它的反击方式，有时候发生的事情比世界上所有的财富或权力都要好。它可以是任何东西，但是很可能您会在爱开始时立即注意到它。无论如何，通常都是这样。无论如何，不​​要害怕它的丰富。欢乐不是要成为面包屑。</p><p>  Only a few months after I started my job, Mary Oliver died of lymphoma. This only added to the strangely long list of things that connected us.</p><p>  我开始工作仅几个月后，玛丽·奥利弗（Mary Oliver）因淋巴瘤去世。这只会增加连接我们的事物的奇怪列表。</p><p>  I was at work the night I learned of her death, and something seemed so moving, so pressing about the announcement. After caring for so many lymphoma patients myself, I could so clearly picture what she may have looked like, how many treatments she had available to her, the side effects she could have experienced, and how her illness probably had progressed. Maybe she had scarred and blistered skin from radiation, or became weak and lost her hair from multiple cycles of chemo—or maybe she had opted for hospice care in the beginning, and chose to go without medical intervention.</p><p>  当我得知她去世的那天晚上，我正在上班，似乎有些感动，对宣布的消息如此紧迫。在我自己照顾了这么多淋巴瘤患者之后，我可以清楚地看到她的模样，可以接受的治疗方法，可能经历的副作用以及她的病情可能如何发展。也许她因放射线而形成了疤痕和水疱，或者由于多次化疗而变得虚弱无力，失去了头发，或者也许她一开始就选择了临终关怀服务，并选择了不进行医疗干预的方式。</p><p> In between trying to imagine what she may have been physically experiencing, my mind searched for an answer as to what she was  feeling during the transition.  Was it what she imagined, the cottage of darkness? Did she have something else she wanted to say? Was she afraid?</p><p> 在试图想象她可能经历过的身体之间，我的思想一直在寻找关于她在过渡期间的感受的答案。她想像的是黑暗的小屋吗？她还有其他想说的话吗？她害怕吗？</p><p> When it’s over, I want to say all my life I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it’s over, I don’t want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don’t want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don’t want to end up simply having visited this world.</p><p> 当结束时，我想说我一生都是一个惊奇的新娘。我是新郎，将世界带入了我的怀抱。当一切结束时，我不想问自己是否使自己的生活变得特别而真实。我不想发现自己在叹气，害怕或充满争论。我不想仅仅因为访问了这个世界而结束了。</p><p>   As the night went on, L became more pale and somnolent as her hemoglobin count dropped. Her full-sentence descriptions of pain became non-verbal cues, and before I knew it she was unwavering in her deep sleep. While she lay between us, L’s sister, husband, and I talked about Mary Oliver’s writing for a long time. I was amazed that they loved her poetry just as much as I did, and continually astonished that all of Mary’s work seemed so relevant in my life. Her observations of humanity, connectedness, and a fluid higher power came together in those quiet moments standing in L’s hospital room. Mary saw the world for exactly what it is—more deep and meaningful than any of us generally believe it to be. L and her family’s ability to connect, flow and move forward with me that night in early May is evidence enough.</p><p>   随着夜晚的继续，L的血红蛋白数量下降，L变得更加苍白和清醒。她对疼痛的完整句子描述成为非语言暗示，在我不知不觉中，她一直在熟睡中坚定不移。当她躺在我们之间时，L的姐姐，丈夫和我谈论了玛丽·奥利弗（Mary Oliver）的写作很久了。他们和我一样喜欢她的诗歌，这让我感到惊讶，并且不断感到玛丽的所有作品对我的生活都如此重要。在L的病房里，那些安静的时刻，她对人类，连通性和强大动力的观察融合在一起。玛丽从本质上看待世界，这比我们所有人普遍认为的更为深刻和有意义。 L和她的家人在5月初的那晚与我保持联系，交流和前进的能力就足够了。</p><p>  In the morning, I left work thinking that L would be gone by mid-day, but when I clocked in for my second overnight shift, I saw that she was once again assigned to me. When I walked into the room to assess her, her family looked calm and exhausted, and L was barely hanging on.</p><p>  早上，我离开工作，以为L会在中午消失，但是当我想起第二夜的倒班时，我发现她再次被分配给了我。当我走进房间评估她的时候，她的家人显得平静又疲惫，而L几乎没有坚持。 </p><p>  When you watch someone slowly die, there are noticeable phases the body goes through. Blood doesn’t circulate effectively to the limbs, so their hands and feet become cool to touch. Feet can get “mottled” (wrinkly). Breathing can look like gasping, the whole body moving with each inhale. When it’s really close to the end, those energy-depleting breaths usually become quiet and shallow, while all the muscles in their face relax, sinking down.</p><p>当您看着某人慢慢死亡时，身体会经历明显的阶段。血液无法有效地流到四肢，因此手脚变得凉爽。脚可能会“斑驳”（皱纹）。呼吸看起来就像喘着粗气，每次吸气都会使整个身体移动。当真正接近尾声时，那些消耗能量的呼吸通常会变得安静而浅沉，而他们脸上的所有肌肉都会放松，下沉。</p><p>   At around 9:00 pm, I lightly knocked on the door of L’s room. I peeked inside to see her sister and husband on each side of the bed, holding her hands and stroking her face.</p><p>   大约在晚上9:00，我轻轻敲了敲L房间的门。我向里偷看，在床的两边看到她的姐姐和丈夫，握住她的手，抚摸着她的脸。</p><p>    against your bones knowing your own life depends on it; and, when the time comes to let it go, to let it go.</p><p>    知道自己的生命取决于生命；并且，当需要放手的时候，就放手。</p><p>  The rest of the night, I followed the carefully laid out instructions for post-mortem care. I called the nurse practitioner on service to officially declare L dead, called the chaplain to offer support if needed, and gave the family about two hours to say their final goodbyes and gather their belongings. Although L’s husband let himself cry, her sister never shed a tear. She looked moved and somber, but also relieved and proud of how it all happened. Perhaps this air of calm runs in the family.</p><p>  剩下的一夜，我遵循了精心安排的验尸指导。我打电话给在职护士护士，宣布L正式死亡，并在必要时打电话给牧师提供支持，并给家人约两个小时的时间说最后的告别，并收拾行李。尽管L的丈夫让自己哭泣，但她的妹妹从未流泪。她看上去既忧郁又忧郁，但也为这一切发生而感到欣慰和自豪。也许这种平静的气氛在家庭中流传。</p><p>  “I’m so sorry for your loss,” I said, hugging L’s sister, “I can tell that she was a really special person.”</p><p>  “我为您的损失感到非常抱歉，”我抱着L姐姐说，“我可以说她是一个非常特别的人。”</p><p> She smiled, looking at L, “She really was. And thank you so much for the recommendations. I was reading to her as she passed, and one of the poems I read was ‘Don’t Hesitate.’ I really loved that one.”</p><p> 她看着L微笑着，“她真的是。非常感谢您的建议。当她过去时，我正在读她的诗，我读的一首诗是《不要犹豫》。我真的很喜欢那首诗。</p><p> Sometimes we get this sudden urge to look up before realizing that another person is staring at us, or just seem to know when someone walks up behind us on the sidewalk. There’s a kind of energy to other people that enables spatial awareness—but when you are in a room with a lifeless body, that feeling becomes noticeably absent for the first time. As I looked down at L, motionless and cool, it was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who had bravely declared her wishes to me the night prior. In her place there was a patch of negative space; her entire presence had evaporated.</p><p> 有时，我们突然有一种抬头的冲动，希望在意识到另一个人在盯着我们，或者只是知道有人何时在人行道上向我们走来时抬起头来。他人有一种能量可以激发空间意识，但是当您身处一具没有生命的房间时，这种感觉就第一次明显消失了。当我低头一动不动地看着L时，很难想象这是前天晚上勇敢地向我宣告她愿望的那个女人。在她的位置上有一小片负空间。她的整个存在都消失了。 </p><p>  This body had been in the room all along, but L was nowhere to be found.</p><p>这个尸体一直在房间里，但是找不到L。</p><p> When we die the body breaks open like a river; the old body goes on, climbing the hill.</p><p> 当我们死时，身体像河一样破裂。老人继续前进，爬上山坡。</p><p>  My coworkers helped me shut off L’s morphine drip, remove her IV, and place her in a white body bag in preparation for the morgue. We quietly and respectfully performed our work in about ten minutes. The whole time, my mind was empty. It didn’t fully hit me until I had left the room how powerful an experience all of it was. I couldn’t help but feel grateful to be a part of such a beautiful transition. Even though I recognized that other deaths I might experience would likely not be as positive or easygoing as my first, I no longer felt terrified of the event itself.</p><p>  我的同事帮助我关闭了L的吗啡滴注液​​，取走了她的静脉注射液，并将其放在白色的尸体袋中，以准备停尸房。我们在大约十分钟内悄悄地恭敬地完成了我们的工作。整个时间里，我的心是空虚的。直到我离开房间后，这一切都没有完全打击到我。我不禁感激能成为如此美好的过渡的一部分。即使我认识到我可能经历的其他死亡可能不会像我的第一次那样积极或随和，但我不再对事件本身感到恐惧。</p><p>  L taught me about the transformative gifts we receive through acceptance. Just like Mary Oliver so often encouraged, L didn’t try to push the truth away—instead, she welcomed it, looked at it with curiosity and patience, and honored what she truly needed in those final moments. She helped me realize that despite all the fear I’d held surrounding the end of a life, it’s possible to make peace with the inevitable unknown.</p><p>  L教了我关于我们通过接受而获得的变革性礼物的信息。就像玛丽·奥利弗（Mary Oliver）经常受到鼓励一样，L并没有试图把真理推开。相反，她欢迎真理，充满好奇和耐心地看着真理，并荣幸地表达了她在最后时刻真正需要的东西。她帮助我意识到，尽管我一直怀着对生命的尽头的恐惧，但还是有可能与不可避免的未知世界和平相处。</p><p>  It’s more than bones. It’s more than the delicate wrist with it’s personal pulse. It’s more than the beating of the single heart. It’s praising. It’s giving until the giving feels like receiving. You have a life—just imagine that!
