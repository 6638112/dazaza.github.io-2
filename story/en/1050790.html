She thinks of the two as the “glue” of their respective domains; just as the viola creates a richer orchestral sound, “there’s a sense in which category theory makes mathematics deeper,” she said.</p><p>Emily Riehl在她长大的中提琴之间看到了相似之处，以及更高类别理论的数学领域，她目前是一个领先的参与者。她认为这两个人是他们各自领域的“胶水”;正如中提琴创造了一个更丰富的管弦乐声音，“在这个类别理论使数学更深的意义上，”她说。</p><p> The categorical perspective emerged in mathematics in 1945 when Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane published their radical paper, “General Theory of Natural Equivalences.” It proposed a deeply unconventional idea, arguing that mathematics needed to  do away with the equal sign, and the whole simplistic notion of equality, and replace it with the deeper, more sophisticated idea of “equivalence.”</p><p> 1945年在数学中出现的分类透视，当时塞缪尔·埃里纳伯格和桑德斯Mac巷发表了自由派纸，“自然等量的一般理论”。它提出了一个深刻的非常规的想法，争论数学需要消除等标志，以及平等的整体概念，并用更深刻的更复杂的“等价”。</p><p> Instead of calling two things exactly equal, Eilenberg and Mac Lane urged mathematicians to embrace sophisticated new mathematical structures that captured the many ways in which two things might be the same, or equivalent.</p><p> 而不是调用两件事完全相等，Eilenberg和Mac Lane敦促数学家拥抱复杂的新数学结构，捕获了两种东西可能相同的许多方式或等同的方式。</p><p> The proposal was received with skepticism. Riehl, an associate professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, says that many early readers of Eilenberg and Mac Lane’s work wondered, “Is this even mathematics?”</p><p> 提案是以怀疑主义收到的。 Johns Hopkins University的数学副教授Riehl说，Eilenberg的许多早期读者和Mac Lane的作品想知道，“这是偶数数学吗？”</p><p> But the doubts didn’t persist for long. Today, category theory and its next-generation version, higher category theory, are central to many fields of math, from algebraic geometry to mathematical physics. In those areas, Riehl said, “I think it would be impossible to describe the kind of basic objects of study without categorical language.”</p><p> 但是，疑惑并不持续。如今，类别理论及其下一代版本，更高的类别理论，是许多数学领域的核心，从代数几何到数学物理学。在那些地区，Riehl说：“我认为不可能描述没有分类语言的那种学习的基本对象。”</p><p> In higher category theory, mathematicians like Riehl don’t just think about ways in which two objects are equivalent. They also think about equivalences between equivalences, and equivalences between equivalences between equivalences, and so on upward in a never-ending tower of relationships. These equivalence relationships are captured in an abstract mathematical object called an infinity category.</p><p> 在更高的类别理论中，像Riehl这样的数学家不仅考虑两个对象等同的方式。他们还考虑等价物之间的等价性，等同率之间的等效性之间的等价性，因此在永无止境的关系塔中向上。这些等价关系在一个名为Infinity类别的抽象数学对象中捕获。</p><p> Riehl is currently working to expand the usefulness of infinity categories in mathematics. She and her longtime collaborator,  Dominic Verity of Macquarie University in Australia, are nearly finished with a book that rewrites the massive, highly technical foundations of the field. Riehl hopes that their reframing will make higher category theory accessible to more mathematicians while offering new insights into why the mathematics of equivalence is so powerful. In part because of this work, Riehl was recently announced as the winner of the  2021 AWM-Joan and Joseph Birman Research Prize in Topology and Geometry.</p><p> Riehl目前正在努力扩展无限类别在数学中的有用性。她和她的长期合作者，澳大利亚的麦古里大学的多米尼克常态几乎完了一本书，可以重写野外的大量技术基础。 Riehl希望他们的重新塑造将使更多数学家提供更高的类别理论，同时提供新的见解为什么对等当量的数学是如此强大。部分原因是这项工作，Riehl最近被宣布为2021年AWM-Joan和Joseph Birman研究奖的拓扑和几何研究奖。 </p><p> Quanta Magazine recently spoke with Riehl about her forthcoming book as well as her years playing high-level Australian rules football, how her identity as a queer woman has been “protective” in mathematics, and the obligation mathematicians have to address the social justice issues of the moment. This interview is based on phone and email interviews and has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p>Quanta Magazine最近与Riehl关于她即将到来的书以及她的年份玩高级澳大利亚统治足球，如何在数学中是“保护性”，而且数学家必须解决社会司法问题此时此刻。这次采访是基于电话和电子邮件访谈，并为清楚起见而被凝聚和编辑。</p><p>  You mentioned  in another interview that you’ve known you wanted to be a mathematician since you “knew that that was a thing that somebody could be.” When was that?</p><p>  你在另一个面试中提到你所知，你想成为一个数学家，因为你“知道这是某人可以成为的事情。”那是什么时候？</p><p> I think the first time I heard of mathematician as a career option was in  Jurassic Park. Jeff Goldblum’s character was obviously the only one who took the threat of the dinosaurs seriously and he was a mathematician. I was 9.</p><p> 我认为我第一次听说数学家作为职业选择是在侏罗纪公园。 Jeff Goldblum的角色显然是唯一一个认真对待恐龙威胁的人，他是一个数学家。我是9。</p><p>  It was very helpful. I was also a musician growing up. I played viola. I knew that the kids who practiced the most were the best. It was just very clear, this correlation between effort and outcome. I knew from a pretty young age that if I could find something that I was passionate about, it would give me a chance to really develop an expertise.</p><p>  这非常有帮助。我也是一位成长的音乐家。我播放中提琴。我知道那些练习最多的孩子是最好的。这很清楚，努力与结果之间的相关性。我从一个漂亮的年轻人那里知道如果我能找到我热情的东西，它会给我一个真正发展专业知识的机会。</p><p>  When I was an undergraduate I was really attracted to abstract algebra. I found the proofs really satisfying. If you’re proving something that relies on some sort of geometric intuition or visualization, I never felt sure that I had it 100% correct. I had the sense that the abstract things are somehow clearer to me than the more concrete things, because I was just more confident that I was understanding them correctly. Category theory is like that to the  nth degree.</p><p>  当我是本科生时，我真的被抽象代数所吸引。我发现证明真的令人满意。如果您已经证明了依赖于某种几何直觉或可视化的东西，我从未觉得我有100％正确。我有这种感觉，抽象的东西对我来说比更具体的东西更清楚，因为我更有信心我正确地了解它们。类别理论就像第n次。</p><p>  What is the difference between equivalence and equality, and what’s gained by thinking about equivalence?</p><p>  等价和平等之间有什么区别，通过思考等价来获得什么？</p><p> Over time, mathematicians have developed an increasingly flexible view of what it means for two objects to be “the same.” In a sense, this progression is inevitable as mathematical objects become increasingly sophisticated. Two objects in a higher category should be considered “the same” when they are equivalent. This essentially means “seen as the same by all other objects in the higher category.” What’s subtle is that an equivalence between two objects should be recorded as additional data.</p><p> 随着时间的推移，数学家已经开发了一个越来越灵活的观点，这两个物体是“相同”的意义。从某种意义上说，随着数学对象变得越来越复杂，这种进展是不可避免的。当它们相当的时，较高类别中的两个对象应该被视为“相同”。这基本上意味着“看到了更高类别中的所有其他物体的相同”。“什么是微妙的是，应该将两个对象之间的等价记录为其他数据。 </p><p> You’ve compared  the role of a category theorist to the role of a violist in an orchestra. In what way are they similar?</p><p>你将一个类化学者在管弦乐队中的角色中的角色进行了比较了一个类别主义者的作用。他们类似的方式是什么？</p><p> If you just had a cello and violin, those are both very pretty instruments, but the sound is not filled out in the way it is when you add a viola, a kind of midlevel harmony. I really think that is how category theory functions in a lot of mathematics.</p><p> 如果你刚刚有一个大提琴和小提琴，那么这些都是非常漂亮的乐器，但声音不是在你添加中提琴的方式填写，这是一种中际和谐。我真的认为这是类别理论在很多数学中的职能。</p><p> You have a forthcoming book,   Elements of ∞-Category Theory, that you hope will be kind of the new standard text for the field. What inspired the book?</p><p> 您有一个即将到来的书籍，∞级理论的元素，您希望将是现场的新标准文本。什么启发了这本书？</p><p> This book describes results from something like 10 papers that I’ve written together with Dominic Verity starting in 2012. We’ve been developing a new approach to the foundations of infinity category theory. Those foundations were developed already by André Joyal and independently by  Jacob Lurie. But they’re increasingly central to certain areas of mathematics, and so a lot of mathematicians are trying to learn these topics, but it’s not easy going and depends in a kind of unfortunate way on the choice of a specific model of an infinity category.</p><p> 本书描述了10篇论文的结果，即我在2012年开始与多米尼克符合一起编写的。我们一直在为无限类别理论的基础开发一种新的方法。这些基础已经由André乔梦和独立由Jacob Lurie开发。但是，他们对某些数学领域越来越核心，所以很多数学家正在努力了解这些主题，但它并不容易进入，并取决于选择无限类别的特定模型的一种不幸的方式。</p><p>  What Dom and I have hit upon is a way to do everything from scratch that lets you start off working model-independently. So, thinking about infinity categories more abstractly, rather than more concretely. And so now we feel like our perspective is mature enough that we want to rewrite the theorems that we’ve published in various papers in a more accessible form directed at somebody who’s learning this stuff for the very first time.</p><p>  什么Dom和我击中是一种从头划痕做所有事情的方法，让您从独立的模式开始工作。所以，更加抽象地思考无限类别，而不是更具体地思考无限类别。所以现在我们觉得我们的观点是足够成熟的，我们希望重写我们在各种论文中发表的定理，以更具可触及的形式，该文件是第一次学习这个东西的人。</p><p> The specific, more concrete model for infinity categories originated in large part with Jacob Lurie’s massive foundational works from a decade or more ago. Is it fair to call your work a user-friendly rewriting of Lurie?</p><p> 特定的，更具体的无限类别模型起源于十年以上或以前的雅各布Lurie的大规模基础作品。致电你的工作是一个用户友好的Lurie的重写是公平的吗？</p><p> Part of what we’re trying to do is give a user-friendly rewrite of Lurie. The theorems are the same, the proofs are very different. There are some new insights and, frankly, I think that the new proofs are better.</p><p> 我们想要做的一部分是给予一个用户友好的Lurie。定理是相同的，证据非常不同。坦率地说，有一些新的见解，我认为新的证据更好。 </p><p>  I’m not sure whether Lurie realized that it was possible to give rigorous model-independent proofs laying the foundations of infinity category theory. Part of the reason that Dom and I are able to establish something along the lines that I suspect Lurie would have wanted is that we were coming along later. There is also a sociological component to the history. Lurie was forced by the community to choose a specific model to prove theorems about infinity categories, because the ideas were so new, and people didn’t believe the proofs otherwise.</p><p>我不确定LURIE是否意识到，有可能给出铺设无限类别理论的基础的严格模型的证据。 DOM和我能够建立沿着我怀疑LURIE的线条的部分原因是我们以后的兴趣。历史也有一个社会学组成部分。 LURIE被社区强迫选择一个特定模型，以证明关于无限类别的定理，因为这些想法是如此之越新，人们不相信证明。</p><p>  In mathematics, the glory tends to go to people who prove new theorems. There’s less currency in improving known results. How do you think about that with respect to your book?</p><p>  在数学中，荣耀往往会去那些证明新定理的人。改善了已知结果的货币较少。你如何考虑一下你的书？</p><p> I’ve sometimes thought of myself as a categorical consultant. One of the things that give me the greatest satisfaction when I think about my career is, it’s not so much about the theorems that I’ve proven, but I think I am playing a supporting role in the mathematical community that is valuable to people.</p><p> 我有时会认为自己是一个分类顾问。当我想到我的职业生涯时，给我最大满足的事情之一，这对我已经证明的定理来说并不是那么多，但我认为我正在在数学社区中发挥支持作用，这对人们有价值。</p><p> Bill Thurston had this  famous MathOverflow post where he responds to, I think it was an undergraduate, who was concerned that they might not be able to contribute to mathematics, because they weren’t sure how they stacked up to Gauss and Euler and Grothendieck. Thurston reminded this person that mathematics really is a community endeavor and there’s a part to be played by everyone.</p><p> 比尔·瑟斯顿拥有这个着名的数学流出帖子，他回应的地方，我认为这是一个本科，他们担心他们可能无法为数学做出贡献，因为他们不确定他们如何依赖于高斯和欧拉和格罗纳伯德。 Thurston提醒这个人，数学真的是一个社区努力，每个人都有一部分。</p><p>   Nobody would choose to play viola for the glory. But you choose to play the viola because you want to be in an orchestra and you kind of feel like you’re right in the middle of the orchestra a lot of the time. If there’s a big swell, the dramatic ending of  The Firebird, you know, you’re right in the middle of it.</p><p>   没有人会选择为荣耀打中提琴。但是你选择扮演中提琴，因为你想成为在管弦乐队，你有点像你在管弦乐队中间的时候很多时间。如果有一个大膨胀，你知道的火鸟的戏剧性结局，你就是在中间的。</p><p> Switching topics to another field in which you’ve excelled, you played Australian rules football at a high level, even playing for the U.S. women’s national team.</p><p> 将主题转换为您表现出色的另一个领域，您在高水平的澳大利亚规则足球上播放了澳大利亚统治足球，甚至为美国妇女的国家队而播放。</p><p>   Well, frankly, what ruined me is, in 2017, I went on sabbatical to Sydney. I was there for eight months and got to play a full season with a proper Australian team. It was really, really wonderful. I was on the best team in Sydney. When I came back, I just knew that it would feel a bit like a letdown after having had the chance to play in Australia for a full season. So, apologies to my U.S. teammates. That was the real reason. I felt like it was time to move on.</p><p>   好吧，坦率地说，在2017年，我在悉尼休假了。我在那里八个月了，必须用一个适当的澳大利亚队来玩一个全赛季。真的很棒真的很棒。我在悉尼最好的球队。当我回来的时候，我刚知道在澳大利亚有机会播放一个全赛季后，它会感到有点像放松。所以，向我的美国队友道歉。这是真正的原因。我觉得是时候开始了。 </p><p> You and  Mike Shulman are working on a project to translate higher category theory into the language of homotopy type theory. You’ve said you hope this work will make it possible to teach infinity categories to undergrads 100 years from now. Why is that the dream?</p><p>您和Mike Shulman正在努力将更高类别理论转化为同型理论的语言。你说你希望这项工作能够从现在开始向100年来教授无穷大类。为什么梦想？</p><p> Mathematicians feel that they haven’t really understood something until it seems simple. So part of the dream for my field is that someday the community will understand it well enough that we can explain it to undergraduates. That’s a proxy for simplicity.</p><p> 数学家觉得他们似乎并没有真正了解，直到它看起来很简单。所以我的领域的一部分是，有一天，社区将很好地了解它，以至于我们可以向本科生解释。这是简单的代理。</p><p> In your response to the Birman Prize announcement, you thanked the  Women in Topology network. Why is that network important to you?</p><p> 在您对Birman奖励公告的回应中，您感谢拓扑网络的妇女。为什么网络对你很重要？</p><p> In my experience, the proportion of female mathematicians varies wildly by subfield, and in algebraic topology I can see exactly why it’s such a welcoming area for young women. It has a lot to do with very specific, proactive efforts taken by the generation of women above me who launched the Women in Topology network. They deserve a lot of credit for everything that feels good about algebraic topology today.</p><p> 在我的经验中，女性数学家的比例因子场而异，而且在代数拓扑中，我可以看到为什么这是一个为年轻女性的温馨区域​​。在推出拓扑网络上的女性上方，妇女的妇女产生的非常具体，主动努力有很多事情要做很多。他们应该为今天代数拓扑的一切感到很大的信誉。</p><p>  Prior to Spectra, there wasn’t really a visible, online association for queer mathematicians. So one of the things we have at Spectra that I think is most powerful is the “ outlist,” where essentially you just volunteer your name, your position and your institution and you can indicate that you identify as a member of the LGBTQ community in mathematics. The intention with this public list is that a Ph.D. student or a postdoc or somebody who wants to know how comfortable they would feel in a particular city or at a particular institution could get in touch with you.</p><p>  在光谱之前，Queer数学家没有真正可见的在线协会。因此，我们认为最强大的频谱的东西是“低估”，在基本上，您只需自愿您的姓名，您的职位和机构，您就可以指出您作为数学中LGBTQ社区的成员。 。与本市名单的意图是博士学位。学生或博士后或有人想知道他们在特定城市或特定机构的舒适程度可以与您联系。</p><p>  No, absolutely not. And I think actually it’s been protective for me in many ways. I think there’s more stigma attached to femininity in mathematics than femaleness necessarily. As a semi-androgynous queer woman, I think that I kind of fit in in the mathematics community better than I would if I were a cis, straight female. I think it also means I’m less likely to get hit on, which is a horrible thing that has happened to a lot of young women in fields where there aren’t enough women.</p><p>  不，绝对没有。我认为实际上它在很多方面对我来说是保护的。我认为数学中的女性气质都比女性更有更多的耻辱。作为一个半雌雄同体的象棋女性，我认为我在数学群落中的适合比我是独联体，直的女性。我认为这也意味着我不太可能被击中，这是一个可怕的事情，这是在那些没有足够的女性的田地里发生了很多年轻女性。</p><p> Spectra came out with a statement in support of Black Lives Matter. You, along with more than 1,500 other mathematicians, also signed a pledge to boycott working with police departments. Why was it important for you to sign that letter?</p><p> Spectra与支持黑人生活的声明出来。您还与超过1,500多名数学家一起签署了抵制与警察部门合作的承诺。为什么要签署那封信很重要？ </p><p> I’m concerned. We’ve definitely had issues with corruption and abuse in the police department in Baltimore.  And at Johns Hopkins, there’s this controversy surrounding a proposal by the administration to introduce a private police force on campus. We’re in a situation where Baltimore is a majority Black city, whereas the majority of people on Johns Hopkins’ campus are not Black. That makes me very concerned for Black students on campus, including one of my Ph.D. students.</p><p>我很担心。我们绝对在巴尔的摩警察局有腐败和滥用问题。在约翰斯霍普金斯，在政府当局向校园推出私人警察部队的建议存在这种争议。我们处于一个巴尔的摩是大多数黑城市的情况，而约翰斯霍金斯校园的大多数人不是黑色。这让我非常关心校园里的黑人学生，包括我的一个博士学位。学生。</p><p> What role or responsibility do you feel that mathematicians have to address social issues of the moment?</p><p> 您认为数学家必须解决这一刻的社会问题的角色或责任是什么？</p><p>  I think it’s very important that we do as much as we can to make sure that all our students have an equal opportunity to learn. If your class has one Black Indigenous person of color and no one else who looks like them, and everyone else is in a study group and this one individual is not, that’s a huge problem.</p><p>  我认为我们尽可能多地确保所有学生都有平等的学习机会非常重要。如果你的班级有一个黑色的颜色，并且没有其他人看起来像他们，而其他人则在一个学习组中，这个人不是，这是一个巨大的问题。</p><p> It’s also a problem if as an instructor you’re using language that suggests that certain arguments are trivial or that this is something that everybody learned in kindergarten. These are tropes that mathematicians like to use, and I think they’re very alienating to people who, for one reason or other, did not learn about modular arithmetic in kindergarten. We have to figure out ways to be allies and mentors for people who are not having the same experiences that we did.</p><p> 这也是一个问题，如果你正在使用语言，这表明某些参数是微不足道的，或者这是每个人都在幼儿园学到的东西。这些都是数学家喜欢使用的，我认为他们对那些一个原因或其他人的人来说非常疏远，没有学习幼儿园的模块化算术。我们必须弄清楚与我们所做的经历没有相同的经验的人来说是盟友和导师。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/emily-riehl-conducts-the-mathematical-orchestra-from-the-middle-20200902/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/emily-riehl-conducts-the-mathematical-orchestra-from-the-middle-20200902/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/理论/">#理论</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/riehl/">#riehl</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/数学/">#数学</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
