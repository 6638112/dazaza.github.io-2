Broadly construed, logic, therefore, is that specific branch of philosophy that studies the processes of correct thinking.\n Etymologically speaking, the term \u201clogic\u201d is derived from the Greek word logos, which is often translated in English as \u201cword\u201d, \u201cdiscourse\u201d or \u201creason\u201d. In the Greek tradition of understanding the nature of reality, the term \u201creason\u201d was commonly appropriated. And for the ancient Greek thinkers, logos as \u201creason\u201d could mean two things, namely: 1) that which refers to \u201chuman reason\u201d, which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality, and 2) that which refers to \u201cuniversal intelligence\u201d or \u201crational divine intelligence\u201d\u2015indeed, that universal ruling force that governs the cosmos.\n   When understood in the  second sense, logos then means (as the ancient Greek thinkers would have us believe) the \u201clight-giving principle\u201d, which enables human persons to understand the nature, dynamics, and mysteries of the universe. When understood in the  first sense, that is, as \u201chuman reason\u201d, logos connotes \u201cstudy\u201d, that is, the rationality of the human mind which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality. Thus, when we employ the term logos in our attempt to make sense of or study something, then we are dealing with the term logos in the first sense. For example, when we define the term \u201cpsychology\u201d from the vantage point of its etymology, then we say that psychology comes from the two Greek words, namely,  psyche, which means \u201cmind\u201d, and  logos, which means \u201cstudy\u201d. Thus, etymologically speaking, psychology is defined as the study of the mind. Indeed, it is in this context that \u201clogic\u201d is, again, defined as the study (or science or reason) of the correct processes of thinking or reasoning.\n More specifically, when we study the correct processes of thinking or reasoning, we are necessarily dealing with arguments. Hence,  in logic, we will be primarily dealing with the principles that govern the validity of arguments, that is, whether a certain conclusion follows from the given premises or assumptions. Let us consider the examples below.\n If it rains today, then the road is wet.  It rains today.  Therefore, the road is wet.\n  The professor will be absent if and only if she is sick.  The professor is sick.  Therefore, she will be absent.\n  The arguments above are obviously valid arguments because their conclusions necessarily follow from the premises. Again, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true for the argument to be valid. However, there are more complicated arguments whose validity cannot be determined by simply looking at them. These arguments require a thorough analysis before we can say that they are indeed valid or not. This is precisely what concerns us in logic, and this is what the rest of the discussions in logic would like to address.

Introduction A QR-code is used to encode text as a graphical image. Depending on the characters used in the text various encoding options for a QR- code exists, e.g. Numeric, Alphanumeric and Byte mode. Even in Byte mode a typical QR-code reader tries to interpret a byte sequence as an UTF-8 or ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded text. Thus QR-codes cannot be used to encode arbitrary binary data directly. Such data has to be converted into an appropriate text before that text could be encoded as a QR-code. Compared to already established Base64, Base32 and Base16 encoding schemes, that are described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], the Base45 scheme described in this document offer a more compact QR- code encoding. One important difference from those and Base45 is the key table and that the padding with &#39;=&#39; is not required.2. Conventions Used in This Document The key words &#34;MUST&#34;, &#34;MUST NOT&#34;, &#34;REQUIRED&#34;, &#34;SHALL&#34;, &#34;SHALL NOT&#34;, &#34;SHOULD&#34;, &#34;SHOULD NOT&#34;, &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;, &#34;MAY&#34;, and &#34;OPTIONAL&#34; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].3. Interpretation of Encoded Data Encoded data is to be interpreted as described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648] with the exception that a different alphabet is selected. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 2] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214. The Base45 Encoding A 45-character subset of US-ASCII is used; the 45 characters usable in a QR code in Alphanumeric mode. Base45 encodes 2 bytes in 3 characters, compared to Base64, which encodes 3 bytes in 4 characters. For encoding two bytes [a, b] MUST be interpreted as a number n in base 256, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 16 bits so that the number n = (a*256) + b. This number n is converted to base 45 [c, d, e] so that n = c + (d*45) + (e*45*45). Note the order of c, d an e which are chosen so that the left-most [c] is the least significant. The values c, d and e are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a three character string. The process is reversed when decoding. For encoding a single byte [a], it MUST be interpreted as a base 256 number, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 8 bit. That integer MUST be converted to base 45 [c d] so that a = c + (45*d). The values c and d are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a two character string. A byte string [a b c d ... x y z] with arbitrary content and arbitrary length MUST be encoded as follows: From left to right pairs of bytes are encoded as described above. If the number of bytes is even, then the encoded form is a string with a length which is evenly divisible by 3. If the number of bytes is odd, then the last (rightmost) byte is encoded on two characters as described above. For decoding a Base45 encoded string the inverse operations are performed.4.1. When to use Base45 If binary data is to be stored in a QR-Code one possible way is to use the Alphanumeric mode that uses 11 bits for 2 characters as defined in section 7.3.4 in ISO/IEC 18004:2015 [ISO18004]. The ECI mode indicator for this encoding is 0010. If the data is to be sent via some other transport, a transport encoding suitable for that transport should be used instead of Base45. It is not recommended to first encode data in Base45 and then encode the resulting string in for example Base64 if the data is to be sent via email. Instead the Base45 encoding should be removed, and the data itself should be encoded in Base64. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 3] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.2. The alphabet used in Base45 The Alphanumeric mode is defined to use 45 characters as specified in this alphabet. Table 1: The Base45 Alphabet Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding 00 0 12 C 24 O 36 Space 01 1 13 D 25 P 37 $ 02 2 14 E 26 Q 38 % 03 3 15 F 27 R 39 * 04 4 16 G 28 S 40 + 05 5 17 H 29 T 41 - 06 6 18 I 30 U 42 . 07 7 19 J 31 V 43 / 08 8 20 K 32 W 44 : 09 9 21 L 33 X 10 A 22 M 34 Y 11 B 23 N 35 Z4.3. Encoding examples It should be noted that although the examples are all text, Base45 is an encoding for binary data where each octet can have any value 0-255. Encoding example 1: The string &#34;AB&#34; is the byte sequence [65 66]. The 16 bit value is 65 * 256 + 66 = 16706. 16706 equals 11 + 45 * 11 + 45 * 45 * 8 so the sequence in base 45 is [11 11 8]. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;BB8&#34;. Encoding example 2: The string &#34;Hello!!&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [72 101 108 108 111 33 33]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [18533 27756 28449 33]. Note the 33 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[38 6 9] [36 31 13] [9 2 14] [33 0]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;%69 VD92EX0&#34;. Encoding example 3: The string &#34;base-45&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [98 97 115 101 45 52 53]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [25185 29541 11572 53]. Note the 53 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[30 19 12] [21 26 14] [7 32 5] [8 1]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;UJCLQE7W581&#34;. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 4] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.4. Decoding examples Decoding example 1: The string &#34;QED8WEX0&#34; represents, when looked up in Table 1, the values [26 14 13 8 32 14 33 0]. We arrange at the numbers in chunks of three, except last which can be two, and get [[26 14 13] [8 32 14] [33 0]]. In base 45 we get [26981 29798 33] where the bytes are [[105 101] [116 102] [33]]. If we look at the ascii values we get the string &#34;ietf!&#34;.5. IANA Considerations There are no considerations for IANA in this document.6. Security Considerations When implementing encoding and decoding it is important to be very careful so that buffer overflow or similar does not occur. This of course includes the calculations for modulo 45 and lookup in the table of characters (Table 1). A decoder also must be robust regarding input, including proper handling of any octet value 0-255, including the NUL character (ASCII 0). It should be noted that Base64 and some other encodings pad the string so that the encoding starts with an aligned number of characters, Base45 specifically avoids padding. Because of this, special care has to be taken when odd number of octets are to be encoded, which results not in N*3 characters, but (N-1)*3+2 characters in the encoded string and similarly, at decoding, when the number of encoded characters are not evenly divisible by 3. Base encodings use a specific, reduced alphabet to encode binary data. Non-alphabet characters could exist within base-encoded data, caused by data corruption or by design. Non-alphabet characters may be exploited as a &#34;covert channel&#34;, where non-protocol data can be sent for nefarious purposes. Non-alphabet characters might also be sent in order to exploit implementation errors leading to, e.g., buffer overflow attacks. Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains characters outside the base alphabet (in Table 1) when interpreting base-encoded data. Even though a Base45 encoded string contains only characters from the alphabet in Table 1 the following case has to be considered: The string &#34;FGW&#34; represents 65535 (FFFF in base 16), which is a valid encoding. The string &#34;GGW&#34; would represent 65536 (10000 in base 16), which is represented by more than 16 bit. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 5] Internet-Draft Base45 June 2021 Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains a triplet of characters which, when decoded, result in an unsigned integer which is greater then 65535 (ffff in base 16). It should be noted that the resulting string after encoding to Base45 might include non-URL-safe characters so if the URL including the Base45 encoded data have to be URL safe, one have to use %-encoding.7.

Between hunts, raucous groups \u201chaul out\u201d onto sea ice to rest. In recent decades, the withering of Arctic ice floes has forced such gatherings onto land, where thousands of walruses lie two or three deep\u2014the weak and the young can die from suffocation or stampedes. In 2019, the Russian photographer Evgenia Arbugaeva spent two weeks, with a scientist, stuck in the middle of a haul-out in the far eastern Chukotka region. The animals stank so badly that her eyes watered. At night, they fought, or made noises, she says, like orcs in \u201c The Lord of the Rings.\u201d In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s more haunting images, a walrus looks in toward her camera through the rough wooden doorway of a gloomy hut. Behind the creature was a floundering mass of its fellows, all leathery flesh and raised tusks. The transfixing thing is the walrus\u2019s eye, which appears to regard the hut\u2019s interior the way an albatross seemingly did  Melville\u2019s Ishmael: \u201cThrough its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.\u201d\n   Arbugaeva was born in the port town of Tiksi, in Siberia. A graduate of the photojournalism program at the International Center of Photography and a contributing photographer to  National Geographic, Arbugaeva made the \u201cChukotka\u201d series between 2018 and 2019, over the course of four trips. The image of the walrus in the doorway sits alongside photos of more or less austere interiors and scenes of traditional hunting life. A dead whale lies at the water\u2019s edge, stars winking overhead. In a small boat, four men\u2014one of them, cigarette in mouth, raising his rifle\u2014approach a walrus in a ritual that looks (firearm aside) ancient and still, violence as bated breath. As Arbugaeva tells it, Chukchi hunters speak silently to their prey after the hunt is over, asking for forgiveness and explaining how they will use the whale\u2019s body. In these photographs, and frequently in Arbugaeva\u2019s work, the scenes have a subdued underwater look, as if recovered from the deep past or icebound legend.\n   The darkling aesthetic is already present in \u201c Weather Man,\u201d the earliest of the four stories (as Arbugaeva prefers to say) in the project, begun in 2013. Arbugaeva told me that it takes weeks to reach each of her Arctic destinations\u2014by plane, boat, and dogsled. Once there, detached from news and ordinary life, the mind behaves strangely, filling the blankness of a daylight landscape, then losing itself in darkness and distance. \u201cWeather Man\u201d is a study of a meteorologist, Vyacheslav Korotki, who lives amid this emptiness, in Khodovarikha, in northern Russia. Arbugaeva uses digital cameras robust enough for Arctic weather; nonetheless, in some respects, her photographs of Korotki\u2014attending to his paper records, visiting an old lighthouse for firewood, making matchstick houses to pass the time\u2014look as though they could have been made at any point in the past century.\n  This atmosphere is not just a matter of style. Some of the places that Arbugaeva photographs really do hover on the edge of history, threatening to blink out. The island of Dikson, in the Kara Sea, is one of the fastest-warming spots in all of Russia, one half of a settlement\u2014the other half is on the mainland\u2014whose population greatly declined after the end of the Soviet Union, from five thousand to around three hundred today. The island portion is populated only by meteorologists. Arbugaeva travelled there with her brother, a filmmaker; she visited all the vacant buildings but struggled to find a way to photograph them. Pictures of ruins from the Soviet era have become a clich\u00e9 in recent decades, but those taken by Arbugaeva conjure something other than the  frisson of  Ostalgie. Her project was saved by, of all things, the fantastical arrival of the aurora borealis; for a matter of hours, confectionary spirals of jade light transformed the island. Arbugaeva raced, sweating, between scenes she had already scouted: a piano clogged with snow, a button-eyed toy by a frosted window, sharp-edged green shadows advancing on the town.\n   An exhibition of Arbugaeva\u2019s work, which recently concluded at the Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London, is called \u201c Hyperborea\u201d\u2014an allusion to a tribe in Greek mythology that lived beyond the north wind. Arbugaeva has long been fascinated by speculative maps of this territory, \u201cthe way the Arctic was alive in people\u2019s imagination before they even set foot there.\u201d Though she calls herself a documentarian, imagination and even magic play parts in her work. Her photographs, she says, may seem too detached from history, \u201ctoo sweet\u201d in their auroral spectacle or still-life hush. The unreality is deliberate. Her work is meant to invoke the folktales attached to Arctic landscapes, the sense of a world subtended by spirits that must be thanked or placated. It is also meant to reflect a modern, magic-realist attitude, with which the facts of the Arctic\u2014the harshness of traditional life, the exploitation of natural resources,  the depredations of global warming\u2014may be expressed in all their complexity. Arbugaeva\u2019s series \u201cKanin Nos\u201d is a portrait of a couple, Ivan and Evgenia, who are lighthouse keepers and meteorologists at a remote station on the Kanin Peninsula, between the White and Barents Seas. In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s images, the couple hardly register amid a snowy haze as they approach the lighthouse. (Evgenia avoids going outside alone, for fear of polar bears.) When Arbugaeva travelled to photograph Ivan and Evgenia, they asked her to bring some apples, and she photographed those, too. Wrapped in newspaper, to protect against the cold, they appear as treasures from a world left behind.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.",

With two dots for eyes and a slight hint of a smile, the 7,000-year-old figurine could be a ritual object, perhaps an amulet, or even a simple doll. The thumb-sized face is one of several dozen figures \u2014 mostly of goats and sheep \u2014 unearthed during an archaeological exploration lasting almost three years at En Esur in Israel  1, about 52 kilometres north of Tel Aviv.\n The excavation at En Esur, also known by its Arabic name of Ein Asawir, \u201cis an extraordinary project\u201d, says Dina Shalem, an archaeologist employed by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), who co-directed the dig with IAA archaeologists Yitzhak Paz and Itai Elad. By the Early Bronze Age, 5,000 years ago, Paz says that En Esur was a \u201cmega-city, the largest so far known in the Southern Levant\u201d, a region spanning modern Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Excavating En Esur was, he says, \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime experience\u201d.\n Built over the remains of an earlier, smaller village (from which the stone face was unearthed), the metropolis spanned an estimated 65 hectares and was home to between 5,000 and 6,000 people; more than 20 times the typical size of villages in that area at the time. Thanks to a year-round flowing spring, the townspeople of En Esur thrived, growing wheat, barley, lentils, grapes and olives, and raising cows, pigs, sheep and goats.\n A visit to the site in November 2019 during an excavation showed how enormous the place once was. Stretching into the distance were the remains of house foundations and alleyways. A grand, 600-square-metre temple enclosed two massive stone basins \u2014 the larger of which was 3.3 metres long and was filled with burnt animal bones, possibly from sacrifices. \u201cWe were really amazed at how densely built the city was,\u201d Shalem says, \u201cthe planning, the streets\u201d. A gigantic pile of approximately 5 million pottery shards, excavated from the site, attests to the domestic life of this bustling town. \u201cPottery, flint, figurines, burials \u2014 we can tell that it\u2019s a complex society,\u201d she says.\n There\u2019s a lot for the archaeologists and labourers to label and store for shipment. But they were not the only ones working at the site. Engineers were also taking measurements for Netivei Israel, the country\u2019s transport infrastructure company, which funded the archaeological excavation in preparation for the building of a road intersection on part of the site. This vanished world, briefly uncovered, disappeared again from view when it was covered with earth and cement over the winter.\n En Esur is a huge site, so most of it is still underground and untouched. But the massive temple and the other excavated parts will remain buried under the road intersection for decades \u2014 possibly longer. Critics charge that this important evidence will never be seen again.\n  This year, hundreds of other archaeological sites might also be buried or destroyed. That\u2019s because most excavations in the country are salvage digs, authorized by the IAA, the government body that oversees antiquities and archaeological sites within the state of Israel. Salvage digs are conducted to document archaeological remains in danger of destruction because of development plans. But the IAA very rarely blocks construction on top of an important archaeological site or takes steps to preserve some portion of the site from being destroyed, says Yonathan Mizrachi, chief executive of Emek Shaveh, an Israeli non-governmental organization based in Jerusalem that works to protect ancient sites as public assets.\n In 2019, salvage digs accounted for more than half of the 424 licences issued by the IAA for archaeological excavations and surveys, according to the agency. In almost all cases, after the archaeologists excavated the sites and removed valuable artefacts, construction projects were allowed to proceed, says Mizrachi.\n  Paving over archaeologically valuable sites isn\u2019t unique to Israel, Mizrachi says. In Turkey, for example, the 12,000-year-old town of Hasankeyf, a monumental site on the Tigris river, has slowly been submerged beneath the new Il\u0131su dam. But some archaeologists say that the situation is particularly problematic in Israel compared with many other countries. One big issue is that the majority of the IAA\u2019s budget comes from the salvage digs before construction projects \u2014 and the government itself is the biggest developer in Israel, says archaeologist Uzi Dahari, a former deputy director of the IAA. The country is also building rapidly to keep up with a surging population. Archaeologists also argue that the Israeli government favours saving ancient Jewish sites, especially in Jerusalem, over ones linked to other religions.\n In Israel, says Mizrachi, \u201cthere are no red lines, or any understanding or rules [for] what should be kept and should be destroyed\u201d.\n Gideon Avni, head of the archaeology division at the IAA, says that rather than block construction after a salvage dig, the IAA tries to prevent development projects in advance if a site is known to be important. The agency, he says, follows strict criteria established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization when deciding whether or not a site should be permanently saved, or covered and built on. He adds that \u201cevery act that we are doing is subject to public monitoring, professional monitoring, our internal system, which tries to prevent this conflict of interest.\u201d\n And some archaeologists in Israel say that many sites would not be excavated at all if it weren\u2019t for the construction projects that provide funding and an impetus for digs. Given Israel\u2019s fast-growing population, they say, the country can\u2019t preserve as many archaeological sites as supporters would like. \u201cI would like the whole country to be covered in archaeology,\u201d says Avni. \u201cBut my children need a place to live.\u201d\n   Compared with other countries around the Mediterranean, Israel has a much higher concentration of archaeological sites in a smaller area, Dahari says. There are about 35,000 sites in a country of 22,145 square kilometres.\n An average of 200\u2013300 archaeological sites are excavated each year as rescue or salvage digs before development. But in evaluating whether construction at the sites can go ahead, the IAA has a conflict of interest because it is heavily funded by the construction industry, says Dahari.\n In 2019, construction-funded salvage digs accounted for 83% of the IAA\u2019s budget of 426 million shekels (US$122.7 million). \u201cOn the one hand, their responsibility is to restore and to protect archaeological sites, but on the other hand, if you will tell the constructor, \u2018don\u2019t build, because this is an archaeological site\u2019, where will the money come from for the IAA? That\u2019s a big contradiction,\u201d Dahari says. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the Israel Antiquities Authority,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I blame the government, because of the budgetary system of salvage excavations.\u201d\n Yorke Rowan, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of Chicago, Illinois, agrees. \u201cThat is one contradictory aspect of the way the IAA works: a major bureaucracy depends on funding from the construction industry to fund itself.\u201d Rowan, who has studied stone bowls, mortars and grinders dating to 5000\u20133000   from previous digs at En Esur, says the difficulty is that the IAA is \u201cmandated to preserve and protect archaeological sites and heritage, but that funding is tied to positive outcomes for development projects\u201d.\n Adding to the pressure is Israel\u2019s rapidly growing population. The nation had a fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman in 2018, compared with 1.7 for the United States and an average of 1.6 in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to which Israel belongs (see \u2018Population boom\u2019). Israel\u2019s current population is more than 9 million; by 2065, according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the population is predicted to swell to 20 million, which would make the country  one of the most densely populated on the planet.\n  The effects of this population boom are obvious across the country. New neighbourhoods crammed with high-rise apartment blocks are springing up on the outskirts of many towns; multi-lane highways criss-cross the country; gleaming malls and industrial zones mark the landscape. Between 2014 and 2017, according to HaMaarag, a consortium of environmental agencies based in Jerusalem, Israel lost 107 square kilometres of undeveloped land to construction and farming.\n With population growth driving so much construction, says Dahari, \u201cthe IAA cannot say, \u2018this is an archaeological site, don\u2019t build anything\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s impossible\u201d. He says the authority \u201cis not finding the middle way between the needs of development and the protection of the archaeological site\u201d. Dahari says that during his tenure at the IAA, the agency classified about 700 of the 35,000 sites in Israel as unique archaeological sites and therefore off-limits for development. But some of these 700 sites \u201care only partially protected\u201d, he says.\n  The list includes a site called Tel Beit Shemesh, which dates back at least to the seventh century  . The settlement was possibly a large-scale centre for olive-oil production  2. Archaeologists regard this site as important because it was located between two rival population centres more than two and a half millennia ago. It would take archaeologists decades to study this kind of site, but a four-lane highway will soon run through it. That is, says Dahari, \u201cin my point of view, a crime against archaeology\u201d. Avni acknowledges that the construction at Tel Beit Shemesh, \u201cwas a very, very painful compromise for us\u201d, balancing the need to preserve the site and building a highway that would serve up to 250,000 people. He said the current plan is to recreate the site in a park on a bridge over the highway.\n  Time is also running out for an ancient hill village called Nebi Zechariah that is at least 2,000 years old. The excavations of the village lie in an industrial zone on the outskirts of Modiin, a city about 26 kilometres northwest of Jerusalem. The excavated buildings have a forsaken air. The stone walls, doorways and mosaic-tiled floors are overgrown with brambles and weeds; a nearby billboard trumpeting a new industrial and logistics centre is pasted with a red sign saying \u201csales closed\u201d. In the distance, the high-rise blocks of the expanding city of Modiin can be glimpsed. By 2040, according to the city plan, the addition of 43,000 housing units will enable the population to more than double, from 93,000 to 240,000. And those plans call for construction in the city\u2019s industrial zone, including over Nebi Zechariah.\n  The ancient site was clearly once a bustling place. Originally founded as a Jewish village during the Roman period, beginning in 63  , it was occupied continuously for about 1,000 years by waves of polytheists, Byzantine Christians and Muslims, living together until it was abandoned in the eleventh century during a period of climate-change-induced drought. Its inhabitants built luxurious houses paved with mosaics, chiselled Christian crosses and Greek inscriptions into their olive presses, and produced glass weights inscribed with Arabic script for weighing coins.\n \u201cThere is a very interesting story in this type of site, because it consists of a kind of continuity of the rural population of ancient Palestine from Roman until Crusader times,\u201d says Avni. \u201cIt also shows a kind of living together of different communities in a settled place at the same time.\u201d\n But that does not mean the decision to build on it was wrong, according to Avni. He says that the settlement is just one out of 400 similar sites of the period in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s not unique when you look at the whole country,\u201d he says. And population pressures inevitably lead to compromises that enable modern development. Even so, \u201cit\u2019s really a pity, when you look at it as a citizen, to destroy it\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful site, and could have been preserved as a park.\u201d\n That\u2019s unlikely to happen. Eyal Malul, a spokesperson for the municipality of Modiin, says part of the land is designated for building.\n  Nebi Zechariah and sites like it might have a better chance of being preserved if they dovetailed with Israel\u2019s national narrative, Mizrachi suggests. \u201cIn general, the Israeli government, for generations, is dealing with Jewish history,\u201d he says. As an example of the government\u2019s interest in preserving Jewish history through archaeology, Mizrachi and other researchers point to a site called the City of David, located in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. An organization called the Ir David Foundation (El-Ad) is authorized by the government to sponsor excavations there and run the City of David National Park. El-Ad claims that the biblical King David built a palace in the City of David 3,000 years ago and says it is \u201cdedicated to the preservation and development of the Biblical City of David\u201d.\n But there is serious disagreement among archaeologists as to whether the large structure that El-Ad identified as King David\u2019s palace was actually from the era in which the biblical king supposedly lived, and whether this ancient stone structure can be linked to him. \u201cEl-Ad\u2019s narrative is based on biblical history, not archaeology. They are content as long as archaeology doesn\u2019t contradict their reading,\u201d says Raphael Greenberg, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University. He argues that El-Ad is \u201csupported by the Israeli administration, that uses archaeology selectively to market its ideology\u201d.\n El-Ad rejects that argument. Doron Spielman, a spokesperson for the organization, says that there have been 20 excavations of the site over 150 years and they have found numerous carved inscriptions and clay stamps with the names of biblical figures. \u201cThere is no other place on Earth that has found more corroborative evidence of the biblical story than the City of David.\u201d\n When it comes to saving or excavating ruins, Avni says, \u201cwe have been accused many times of giving preference to Jewish sites or synagogues. When you look at the history of archaeology in this country, it\u2019s not baseless.\u201d But he says that those criticisms applied to the early years of the country\u2019s modern history, and that now, \u201cmost of the sites we are excavating are Byzantine Christian, early Muslim, medieval Muslim and Ottoman.\u201d Avni\u2019s own speciality is early Islamic archaeology.\n Yet some researchers say that when archaeological sites involve religions other than Judaism, they sometimes get less protection. And many Israelis aren\u2019t aware that people of different religions coexisted in the region after Islam arrived in the seventh century  , says Mizrachi. He adds that sites from the early Islamic period \u201care extremely important to be preserved and Nebi Zechariah is a very good example of that\u201d.\n  Without financing, however, the likelihood of preserving such sites is slim. Unlike the excavations funded by El-Ad, very few of the digs that the IAA conducts are financed independently. There would be no excavation at En Esur had a road junction not been planned there, and laboratory research on material collected at the site will continue for years, say the IAA archaeologists who work there. \u201cWhat we rescue is the knowledge, not necessarily the site,\u201d says Paz. He and the other IAA archaeologists who excavated En Esur declined to say whether the site itself should have been preserved.\n But others aren\u2019t so guarded. Greenberg, an expert on the Bronze Age in the Levant and a former IAA employee, questions the speed at which the salvage dig at En Esur was conducted, although he emphasizes that this is not the fault of the archaeologists but of the system that forces rapid excavations. \u201cBecause the site was excavated under severe time constraints, and because of the unprecedented quantity of finds that must be processed, it will be years before we have a detailed understanding of the results,\u201d he says.\n Less-destructive alternatives exist, Greenberg contends. For example, he suggests that 5% of the threatened site could have been set aside and excavated thoroughly, with the road project covering the rest of it.\n  Greenberg has general concerns about speedy salvage excavations. Academic excavations typically take many years. Researchers alternate time in the field with longer stretches in the lab to study findings and adjust their plans for later stages of the dig. That\u2019s not possible during a salvage operation, he says.\n The kind of alternative that Greenberg envisaged for En Esur is sometimes possible in other countries, such as the United States and France, even if excavations do get paved over there, too. Archaeologist Morag Kersel at DePaul University in Chicago, points to the Miami Circle in Florida, a round structure linked to the Native American Tequesta people that was scheduled to be destroyed, but was preserved after protests. Sometimes, she says, \u201cwhen it is feasible, projects are redesigned to avoid the destruction of the site\u201d.\n One difference in the United States, explains Rowan, is that \u201cthere is an extra level of oversight at the state level\u201d. Each US state has a State Historic Preservation Office that oversees surveys and excavations. If nothing important is found during a salvage survey, the office will approve the site for development, but it can mandate extra testing, including remote sensing and excavation, if significant evidence is found.\n \u201cSomething like En Esur, if it was in the United States, that would be stunning. There\u2019s not a chance you would pave it over,\u201d says Rowan. \u201cI have great faith that they did a good job, because I know the archaeologists. It does seem a shame to pave over a site like that.\u201d\n Archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji, former director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Nanterre, calls En Esur \u201ca great discovery\u201d. In France, he says, \u201cit has happened many times that the line of a highway had to be changed because an important discovery was made\u201d.\n Even so, his approach is pragmatic: \u201cWe have to look for an equilibrium, for balance, between the necessity of modern life and the necessity of preserving the heritage.\u201d\n      1.

goal is to make our Camera the fastest way to share a moment. We do not want Snapchatters to face any delays when they are in the moment and want to share with their real friends.\n Network requests are on the critical path of using Snapchat. Compared to a UI update or disk write that takes milliseconds, network latency can take seconds with high error rate and device constraints. To reduce network latency and error, we make requests and responses smaller, reduce unnecessary sync, utilize global content distribution partners to bring media close to the people who use it, and use an efficient, next generation network protocol called Quick UDP Internet Connections, or   QUIC for short.\n   Let\u2019s first take a quick look at the network stack before QUIC. Take a Snap send as an example: on the application layer, we put the Snap media into the   HTTP2 request payload. Then we use   TLS to ensure the connection safety on the security layer and leverage   TCP to split the request into chunks and upload the Snap to the server. However the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 stack is suboptimal for the mobile network environment. For example, TCP requests will fail if a Snapchatter\u00a0switches between WiFi and WWAN. For a user chatting with friends, failure to send a message due to a connection drop can lead to a degraded experience.\n   QUIC is a transport protocol for the internet, developed by engineers at Google. QUIC is the foundation of   HTTP3 that replaces the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 and is built on top of UDP. QUIC solves a number of transport-layer and application-layer problems while requiring little or no change from application developers. As the above diagram depicts, QUIC does not alter the low-level operating system network protocols nor does it alter high-level HTTP.\n  Faster connection establishment: QUIC handshakes support   zero roundtrips before sending payload, compared to   1-3 round trips for TCP+TLS.\n Improved congestion control: QUIC has pluggable congestion control, and provides richer information to the congestion control algorithm than TCP. For example   QUIC BBR v1 and   QUIC BBR v2.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: For HTTP2 connections, when a TCP packet is lost, no streams on that connection can make forward progress until the packet is retransmitted and received by the far side. This leads to increased latency and a potentially degraded user experience on mobile network connections. QUIC eliminates this stalling for other streams multiplexed over the same connection.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: A TCP request will fail if the IP changes. However, QUIC connections are recognized by a QUIC protocol layer randomly generated 64 bit identifier, so a client using QUIC can continue in-flight requests, uninterrupted across a change in IP address, allowing for an undisturbed user experience.\n   Faster connection establishment: At Snapchat, before QUIC, p90 connection setup took up to 300ms. This connection setup latency translates to user waiting latency, and blocks the user from receiving Snaps and viewing Stories. Faster connection on QUIC directly reduces user waiting latency and improves the user experience.\n Improved congestion control: At Snap, the size of upload media can be as large as 10MB. A better congestion control algorithm improves throughput, reduces latency and error rate especially for large media.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: Snapchat has rich use cases with short content, including Snaps, Stories, Discover content, etc. Normally there are multiple download streams using the same connection. QUIC eliminates the HTTP2 head of blocking issues, such as avoiding the send message requests blocking spotlight requests.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: When with friends, failure to send a message due to a drop in their wifi connection can lead to a degraded experience. Connection migration solves this pain point.\n Detection of lost connection: A long loading spinner due to a lost connection is disturbing, especially when a Snapchatter is in full screen mode enjoying content. With QUIC, when requests fail due to a lost connection, we can detect and retry while providing a user-friendly UI.\n  Snapchat\u2019s client network stack is built on top of the open-source mobile network library   Cronet. Snap leverages Cronet not only for QUIC but also for improved observability through rich metrics and logs. We are able to build a cohesive view of client and server network performance.\n  We chose different protocols based on the network performance across countries and platforms. In general, we observed that enabling QUIC improved p90/P99 network latency by 6-20% and network errors by 3%-8%. There are even more improvements on the low network connectivity user cohort. Here we showcase three examples.\n In the first example, we enabled QUIC on our ads service in Oct 2019. We observed latency improvements across P90/P99 and error rate.\n   We observed error rate improvements across all error codes, including connection timeout, connection lost, request timeout. In further breakdowns of the latency improvements by country and region, we observed higher latency improvement for countries and regions with relatively worse network quality and further geo distance to our services.\n In the second example, on top of QUIC, enabling BBR congestion control on the client to server path also brought significant latency improvements. And there are more improvements with larger request payload.\n   In the last example, by enabling connection migration on Android, the network request success rate when losing a wifi connection increased by 20%.\n  With the success story on QUIC integration, moving forward, we will double down on QUIC, including:", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:45:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "quick,quic", "title": "quick.
