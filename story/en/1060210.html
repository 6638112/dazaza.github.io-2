After all, that’s where most of us are, and so that’s where we have our wild ideas.</p><p>  将他们追溯到足够的地方，你会发现许多农场故事在城市开始。毕竟，这就是我们大多数人所在的地方，所以这就是我们拥有我们狂野的想法的地方。</p><p> This one begins in Toronto in the summer of 1983, when a 32-year-old artist named David Holmes threw out his back. At the time, David’s art practice involved collecting artifacts from the side of an old highway leading out of the city. He’d come to see the trash-filled ditch as a sort of beachfront on the ocean of our collective unconscious; every day he bicycled alongside it, gathering odd bits of detritus—clothing, jewellery, letters—and assembling them in his cramped rented studio above a souvenir spoon factory in the west end of the city. For money, David did small carpentry jobs and other contract work, until the day he took a gig laying flagstones, hurt himself, and that was that.</p><p> 这一人于1983年夏天开始于多伦多，当时一个名叫大卫霍尔姆斯的32岁的艺术家扔了他的背部。当时，大卫的艺术实践涉及从一个城市前往城市的老高速公路的一侧收集文物。他将在我们集体无意识的海洋上看到垃圾充满垃圾的沟渠;每天他都骑自行车，聚集奇特的碎屑服装，珠宝，信件，并在他狭窄的租盘的工作室里装配它们在城市西端的纪念品勺工厂上方。为了钱，大卫做了小型木工就业和其他合同工作，直到他拿了一场演出的那一天，伤害自己，这就是那样。</p><p> After a month flat on his back, sweating in the August heat and listening to the regular stamp of the metal press below, he finally made it to a chiropractor, who told him to avoid manual labour for a while. By then, the pinch of hunger was starting to squeeze harder. So David reached out to a friend whose work involved matching independent support workers with people who need assistance, to see if he knew of any open positions. That’s how David met Peter.</p><p> 一个月后，在他的背上平坦，在八月的热量中出汗，听到下面的金属压力机的常规印章，他终于将它交给了一名脊椎按摩师，他告诉他避免了手工劳动一段时间。到那时，饥饿的捏开始挤压。所以大卫向一个朋友伸出协议，他们涉及与需要帮助的人匹配独立的支持工人，看看他是否知道任何开放职位。这就是大卫遇到彼得的方式。</p><p>    Peter was 16 years old and had Down syndrome. His parents invited David to sit in on a class Peter attended at a junior high school in the city, to see how he was doing. “I went into this classroom and there was Peter, sitting on the floor,” David recalls. That encounter would prove to be the start of a friendship which has spanned nearly four decades, and though they had no way of knowing it at the time, it marked the beginning of both of their lives’ work. It would eventually lead them to a small farm (hereafter: the Farm) about an hour north of Toronto, where David has lived since 1998, and where Peter travels most days to help care for the animals.</p><p>    彼得16岁，唐氏综合症。他的父母邀请David坐在一堂课上，彼得在城市的一所初中参加，看看他是如何做的。 “我走进这个教室，彼得，坐在地板上，”大卫召回。这遭遇将被证明是跨越近四十年的友谊的开始，尽管他们当时没有理解它，它标志着他们的生活的开始。它最终会将他们带到一个小农场（下文：农场）大约一九九八年以来一直居住在多伦多，在大卫自1998年以来，彼得旅行大部分时间以帮助您的动物。</p><p> From the beginning, theirs has been a relationship based on mutual respect and appreciation, but not on spoken language, as Peter doesn’t use words to communicate.</p><p> 从一开始，他们的是基于相互尊重和欣赏的关系，但不是口语，因为彼得不用用词来沟通。</p><p>  David was captivated by the way that not talking changed how it felt to be in the world. “There’s something frightening about it,” he recalls of those early days getting to know Peter. “You feel out of your depth. How do you connect? But very gradually, something forms.”</p><p>  大卫被没有说话的方式被迷恋，而没有改变它在世界上它是如何感受到的。 “它有一些可怕的东西，”他回忆起那些早期了解彼得。 “你感觉不到你的深度。你如何连接？但非常逐渐，某种形式。“ </p><p>  Overwhelmed in the classroom, Peter and David began taking long, slow walks around the neighbourhood together. In Peter’s unhurried pace and frequent pauses, they found a shared rhythm and a way of enjoying each other’s company.</p><p>在课堂上不堪重负，彼得和大卫开始长时间慢慢地走在邻居周围。在彼得的不起作道的速度和频繁的暂停中，他们发现了一个共享的节奏和一种享受彼此的公司的方式。</p><p> Before long Peter’s parents hired David to support him full-time, and David introduced Peter to his world of artist friends. They began documenting their time together, and David got a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to make a film with Peter, which led to a collaboration with some other artists to make a sound-art performance. But over time, their partnership gradually shifted from artmaking to gardening, and ultimately, to farming. For a while, the two worked in a farm-garden north of Toronto and delivered boxes of produce to their CSA (community-supported agriculture) members back in the city.</p><p> 在长彼得的父母之前聘请大卫全职支持他，大卫介绍了他的艺术家世界的彼得。他们开始在一起记录他们的时间，大卫获得了加拿大艺术委员会的批准，以便与彼得的电影制作，这导致了与其他一些艺术家合作进行了健全的表现。但随着时间的推移，他们的伙伴关系逐渐从艺术中转向园艺，最终到农业。有一段时间，两人在多伦多北部的一个农场花园里工作，并向他们的CSA（社区支持的农业）成员交付了一箱产品。</p><p>    Through the 1990s David grew enamoured with the local food movement. One day, he dug up the entire backyard and converted it into a garden. He dreamed obsessively about having his own land to farm. Finally, in 1998, he and his then-wife bought 25 acres at the end of a dirt lane near Lake Simcoe, with a rickety barn, a big yard for gardening, several pastures for grazing, and a charming old farmhouse. David bought two Belgian draft horses, along with a small flock of sheep and a coop full of hens. Ultimately, David’s wife realized the Farm was more his dream than hers, but he felt he needed to see it through, so they decided to separate. Peter kept coming, and the Farm became their mutual project.</p><p>    通过20世纪90年代，大卫成长为当地的食物运动。有一天，他挖了整个后院并将它转化为一个花园。他曾痴迷地梦想着拥有自己的土地。最后，1998年，他和他的当时妻子在辛科湖附近的一条泥土的末端买了25亩，盐鳟鱼，园艺大院子里，几个牧场放牧，以及一个迷人的老农舍。大卫买了两匹比利时的马匹，以及一小群羊和一个装满母鸡的鸡舍。最终，大卫的妻子意识到农场更像是他的梦想，而不是她的梦想，但他觉得他需要看到它，所以他们决定分开。彼得一直到来，农场成为他们的共同项目。</p><p> David’s version of farm life has always been more focused on presence than productivity. Over the years, vegetables have been grown and hens have laid eggs, but the value of the Farm could never be measured by quantities of food.</p><p> 大卫的农场生活版本始终比生产力更集中。多年来，蔬菜已经成长，母鸡已经占用了鸡蛋，但农场的价值永远无法通过量的食物来衡量。</p><p>  Rather than crops or yields, David and Peter’s harvest is each little detail noticed and celebrated: a trusting moment that passes between Peter and one of the horses, or the bright red sumac buds that David hangs above the kitchen table.</p><p>  大卫和彼得的收获而不是庄稼或产量，而不是庄稼，而且庆祝的是：彼得和其中一匹马匹之间的信任时刻，或大卫悬挂在厨房桌子上方的明亮红色的Sumac芽。</p><p>  From the beginning, the Farm was a place where David and Peter could break the limitations imposed on people with developmental disabilities. David abhors condescension, and he hates that people like Peter are sometimes confined and excluded under the guise of care. His approach has always been to make space for spontaneity and to let Peter take the lead. Life on the Farm is thoroughly anti-systematic: there are no programs and no therapeutic outcomes, just the quiet routines of preparing and sharing meals, tending to a few animals, and passing the time. In that sense, the Farm is a lifelong extension of the moment when David and Peter first walked out of the classroom and took to the streets.</p><p>  从一开始，农场是大卫和彼得可以打破对具有发展残疾人罪的局限性的地方。 David Abhors Condescension，他讨厌像彼得这样的人有时被限制在关怀的幌子下。他的方法一直是为自发性制造空间，让彼得拿领先铅。农场的生活是彻底的反系统：没有课程，也没有治疗结果，只是准备和分享餐的安静惯例，抚育到几只动物，并通过时间。从这个意义上说，当大卫和彼得首先走出教室并坐在街上时，农场是一瞬间的终身延伸。</p><p>    Inspired by what David and Peter were doing at the Farm, others began joining them. David and Peter were connected to a larger network of families with members who were on the autism spectrum and used no spoken language, and some of these men became regulars. Neighbours started dropping in regularly, and friends and acquaintances from around Ontario began making the trip, to lend a hand and savour the atmosphere. (I was one of those, for several years.) The numbers have ebbed and flowed, but a small community has always coalesced around the Farm: loose, evolving, and delightfully unlikely. Today, it’s mainly just Peter and his close friend Kevin. Kevin doesn’t use spoken language either, but he, Peter, and David have found a rich and subtle terrain of conversation that goes beyond words: gestures, body language, touch, and eye contact.</p><p>    灵感来自大卫和彼得在农场做的事情，其他人开始加入他们。大卫和彼得与在自闭症频谱上的成员的较大网络连接到更大的家庭网络，并没有使用口语语言，其中一些人变得常客。邻居们经常开始滴加，来自安大略省周围的朋友和熟人开始前往旅行，伸出手，品尝气氛。 （我是其中一个，多年来。）数字已经开始了，流动了，但小社区一直在农场聚会：松动，不断发展，不太可能。今天，它主要只是彼得和他亲密的朋友凯文。凯文不使用口语，但他，彼得和大卫发现了一个丰富而微妙的交谈地形，超越了单词：手势，肢体语言，触摸和目光接触。 </p><p>    Many fail to realize how extensively and aggressively our society has excluded people like Peter and Kevin. Since the middle of the 19th century, people with developmental disabilities were shunted to remote institutions in the countryside, where they were cruelly labelled and robbed of their autonomy and privacy. Many were abused, whether physically, psychologically, or sexually. The inclusion movement has now grown strong, and most of the large institutions have closed, but our collective habit of ostracizing nonconformists is still powerfully ingrained. We were taught fear rather than curiosity, pity rather than enjoyment. We learned to patronize and infantilize, not to trust and learn.</p><p>许多人未能意识到我们的社会在彼得和凯文等人民中排除了多大洋感。自19世纪中叶以来，发展障碍的人被分发到乡村的偏远机构，在那里他们被残酷地标记并抢劫了他们的自主权和隐私。许多人被滥用，无论是身体素质，心理上还是性。纳入运动现已发展强劲，大部分大型机构已关闭，但我们对不合格主义者的集体习惯仍然有力地加入。我们被教导而不是好奇心，怜悯而不是享受。我们学会了光顾和婴儿，不相信和学习。</p><p> Most of us share this wound: our capacity for appreciating our fellow humans has been curtailed by programs of segregation, so that we don’t even understand what we’ve lost. When we cut ourselves off—consciously or unconsciously—from those who don’t fit our ideals of productivity or standards of success, we are more easily trapped by the need to prove ourselves.</p><p> 我们大多数人分享这个伤口：我们欣赏我们的人民的升值能力被隔离计划被缩减，因此我们甚至不明白我们失去了什么。当我们自觉或无意识地削减自己的人 - 从那些不符合我们的生产力或成功标准的理想，我们更容易被证明自己所困扰。</p><p>  One finds an uncommon freedom at the Farm, in the company of Peter and Kevin, as well as a certain grief, realizing what we’ve habitually missed, and what it’s cost us. If we ignore those who don’t talk, we fail to develop beyond our words.</p><p>  人们在彼得和凯文公司以及一定的悲伤中发现了农场的罕见自由，实现我们习惯性错过的东西，以及它的费用。如果我们忽略那些不说话的人，我们就无法发展超出我们的话。</p><p>  David believes that the men who come to the farm are able to connect deeply with the animals and the natural world, in part because of the way that society has dismissed them. “If you’re in a place where no one can see you, you feel it,” he says. “For a lot of people, their life-saving connection is nature. Because nature does not project onto them a life sentence. Nature doesn’t do that. The animals don’t do that. Their relational capacity is not blocked by that construct.”</p><p>  大卫认为，那些来农场的人能够深入与动物和自然界深入联系，部分原因是社会解雇了他们的方式。 “如果你在一个没有人能看到你的地方，你觉得它，”他说。 “对于很多人来说，他们的救生连接就是性质。因为大自然没有投入他们的终身判决。自然并不那样。动物不这样做。他们的关系容量不会被该构造阻挡。“</p><p> David says that the men who come to the farm have acted as guides for him. Spending time with them, his perception alters, and there are moments of breakthrough, when the grass is sharper and the moon is more familiar. “It has to do with the stopping. You have to stop, to get to wonder. It’s a different window.”</p><p> 大卫说，那个来农场的人为他担任指南。与他们共度时光，他的感知改变，当草更锐利时，有突破的时刻，月亮更熟悉。 “它与停止有关。你必须停下来，想知道。这是一个不同的窗口。“</p><p>    Nowadays, a day at the Farm starts with a gathering in the living room, where the cast iron wood stove emanates comforting waves of heat. Kevin arrives first. He and David spend the first hour or so eating a light breakfast and relaxing on the sofa. Kevin prefers things to be more orderly than David, so he does some tidying up. A Great Pyrenees named Babette pads noisily around, knocking the furniture with her long tail, before settling to snore under a side table.</p><p>    如今，农场的一天从起居室的聚会开始，铸铁木炉在那里散发着舒适的热量。凯文先到达。他和大卫花了第一小时左右吃饭，并在沙发上放松身心。凯文更喜欢比大卫更有序的东西，所以他做了一些整理。一个伟大的比利牛斯吵闹地命名为孩儿垫，在侧桌子下沉淀到打鼾之前将家具敲门。</p><p> Then Peter arrives, and the three men begin their routine of reading aloud from a book. It’s something they all enjoy and has become a staple of their day. Mary Oliver has long been a favourite for the men at the Farm, but for the last few years David has mainly been reading the works of the eco-philosopher Thomas Berry (1914–2009), who wrote about what he called the “Great Work”: the process of transforming our collective relationship to the earth, to make it mutually beneficial rather than simply extractive. But we can’t have a mutually beneficial relationship with the earth until we have a real relationship, says David.</p><p> 然后彼得到了，这三人从一本书开始大声朗读他们的阅读。这是他们都喜欢的东西，已经成为他们一天的主食。玛丽奥利斯长期以来一直是农场的男人的最爱，但在过去几年大卫主要一直在阅读生态哲学家托马斯·贝瑞（1914-2009）的作品，他写了他所谓的“伟大的工作“：将我们与地球的集体关系转化的过程，使其互利而不是简单地提取。但我们不能与地球有一个互利的关系，直到我们有着真正的关系，说大卫说。 </p><p>  Since the beginning of their friendship, Peter has been showing him how to find that communion with nature. “I’ve watched him go into states of wonder and awe,” David says. “It’s affecting when someone’s in that space. It communicates. And if you’re not talking, that’s helpful, because words aren’t interfering.”</p><p>自从他们的友谊开始以来，彼得一直向他展示如何与大自然找到这个圣餐。 “我看着他进入奇迹和敬畏的州，”大卫说。 “当某人在那个空间时，它会影响。它沟通了。如果你不说话，那就很有帮助，因为言语并不干扰。“</p><p>  After the reading, if everyone is feeling well, they make a trip to the barn. The 300-foot journey is as slow and deliberate as a religious procession, especially across the winter snow and ice. Once arrived, the atmosphere inside the barn is precisely like a cathedral, with its sombre light and air of stillness. One feels an instinct to whisper, and, like Peter and Kevin, to take careful, quiet steps.</p><p>  阅读后，如果每个人都感觉良好，他们就会去谷仓旅行。 300英尺的旅程与宗教游行一样缓慢和刻意，特别是在冬天的雪和冰上。曾经到了，谷仓内的气氛正好像大教堂一样，其阴沉的光明和静止的空气。一个人感觉到耳语，而且像彼得和凯文一样，要小心，安静的步骤。</p><p>    The first order of business is to feed and water the sheep. On this particular day, we discover that one of the ewes has given birth. The little newborn is already skittering around on four legs while keeping close to its mother. Seeing the lamb, the quietness among the men intensifies. For several long minutes, they hover in the corner, taking in the scene. Kevin reaches out and removes some straw from Peter’s hat.</p><p>    第一批业务是喂养和养羊。在这个特殊的一天，我们发现其中一个母羊生了出生。小新生儿已经在四条腿上闻到了四条腿，同时保持接近母亲。看到羔羊，男人之间的安静加剧了。几分钟，他们悬停在角落里，占据了现场。凯文从彼得的帽子里伸出去除一些稻草。</p><p> After the sheep, it’s Whistler’s turn. A gorgeous standardbred horse with a dark brown coat and black mane, Whistler has gotten some burrs in his coat from the pasture. David sets about pulling them off while Kevin gets to work with a curry comb, lifting clouds of dust into the slanting light. With a word or two of coaching from David every now and then, Kevin runs the brush lightly in circles along Whistler’s flank.</p><p> 羊后，这是惠斯勒的回合。惠斯勒从牧场上戴上了一些华丽的标准马匹和黑色鬃毛，从牧场上拿着一些毛刺。大卫套装关于将它们拉下来，而凯文搭配咖喱梳，将灰尘升降到倾斜的光线。现在然后，随着David的一句话或两者，凯文沿着惠斯勒的侧翼轻轻地用圈子翩翩起舞。</p><p> The barn was once busier than it is now. There used to be eight horses, not one, along with 100 hens and 12 sheep, plus goats, pigs, and rabbits. For David, working with the men has eclipsed his work with the animals and the gardens, and over time, the Farm has gradually shrunk to just one horse, seven sheep, and a dog.</p><p> 谷仓曾经比现在更忙。曾经有八匹马，而不是一个，以及100母鸡和12只羊，加上山羊，猪和兔子。对于大卫而言，与男人合作已经用动物和花园的工作黯然失色，随着时间的推移，农场逐渐缩小到一匹马，七只羊和一只狗。</p><p>  “At times, I see the Farm as a failure, and myself as a failure,” he tells me that evening after Peter and Kevin have gone home. “But the part that hasn’t been a failure is that I made a choice to stay with the men. For me, it has opened up some cracks that I think are precious and vital.”</p><p>  “有时，我认为农场是一个失败，而且我自己是一个失败，”他在彼得和凯文回家后晚上告诉我。 “但是没有失败的部分是我做出了选择与男人一起待在一起。对我来说，它已经开辟了一些我认为珍贵和至关重要的裂缝。“</p><p>  No one who’s visited the Farm would call it a failure, in any sense. But it does defy the traditional logic of farms: to work hard and live off the land. What else is a farm for? View the Farm, instead, as a sanctuary for both nature and humans, as an experiment in moving slowly and mindfully, and the answer appears instantly: it’s sacred. That word feels fragile and mysterious, like a newborn lamb adjusting to the soft light of the barn, and three men standing quietly together to watch. No other word quite fits such a scene, but if “sacred” or “holy” seem too shaky, don’t say anything at all. It’s fine. There’s no need.  ■</p><p>  没有人参观过农场会在任何意义上称之为失败。但它确实违反了农场的传统逻辑：努力工作并从土地上生活。还有什么农场？看看农场，而是作为自然和人类的避难所，作为慢慢和心动的实验，答案立即出现：这是神圣的。这一词感觉脆弱而神秘，就像一个新生的羊羔调整到谷仓的柔和光线，三人静静地站在一起观看。没有其他单词非常适合这样的场景，但如果“神圣”或“圣洁”似乎太糟糕了，根本不说什么。没关系。没有必要。 ■ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://beside.media/besiders/the-great-work/">https://beside.media/besiders/the-great-work/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/great/">#great</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/大卫/">#大卫</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
