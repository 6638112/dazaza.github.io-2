There’s a fair amount of backstabbing in the government, even in the civil service. Whenever you chose to reach out to a 3rd party to ask for help you were taking a risk that the person you reached out to would screw you over. Just because DC doesn’t have a palace doesn’t mean we don’t have palace intrigues.</p><p>这是我最喜欢的USDS故事之一：在USDS的职业生涯中，我很快就受到了声名狼藉，因为您可以向其发出SOS求救电话，而不仅仅是USDS内部，而是外部与承包商和其他政府合作伙伴的联系。政府甚至在公务员制度中都有相当多的背叛行为。每当您选择向第三方求助时，您都会冒与被求助者相处的危险。仅仅因为DC没有宫殿，并不意味着我们没有宫殿的阴谋。</p><p> Anyway, one day this group of security researchers reached out to me and let me know that the agency they were working with was being actively targeted by domestic white supremacists. They had alerted the appropriate people and made recommendations but were getting the run around. The website the white supremacists were interested in targeting had  thousands of known security vulnerabilities but it also had a very specific launch date non-negotiable and written into law (this is a stupidly common thing in government). Leadership did not want to stop development work to fix security issues, but they also could not be seen to be ignoring security issues. Especially not thousands of them. So they would engage with the researchers, put on this big performance with meetings and field trips and PowerPoint decks, and then do nothing.</p><p> 无论如何，有一天，这群安全研究人员与我联系，并让我知道与他们合作的该机构正受到国内白人至上主义者的积极攻击。他们已经警告了适当的人员并提出了建议，但是却四处奔波。白人至上主义者感兴趣的网站有成千上万个已知的安全漏洞，但它也有一个非常具体的发布日期，不可协商，并已写入法律（这在政府中非常普遍）。领导层不想停止开发工作来解决安全问题，但是也不能认为他们忽略了安全问题。尤其是其中的数千个。因此，他们将与研究人员互动，通过会议，实地考察和PowerPoint演示文稿进行这项大型表演，然后什么也不做。</p><p> And they were doing this on multiple fronts, slow walking both external consultants and government oversight authorities. It wasn’t a situation where we could report the problem up to one of the many organizations in charge of information security in the federal government. Everyone who could be called upon to apply pressure was already aware of the situation and applying maximum pressure.</p><p> 他们在多个方面都在这样做，外部顾问和政府监督部门的步伐都很缓慢。在这种情况下，我们无法向联邦政府负责信息安全的众多组织之一报告问题。每个可能被要求施加压力的人都已经意识到情况并施加最大压力。</p><p> I suggested we let the FBI know and see if they could block the potential attackers for us without worrying about the website. No crime had yet been committed, so the FBI couldn’t technically do anything about the threats. But they do track this kind of information and perhaps what the security researchers had could support other investigations. It took me a couple of weeks to find the right contact and reach out. After establishing that he was on the relevant task force and that they did track this info and were interested in hearing about what we had found, I suggested we go grab coffee and fill in some of the details. I had provided a set of potential locations, including the agency cafeteria which was super nice.</p><p> 我建议我们让FBI知道，看看他们是否可以为我们阻止潜在的攻击者而无需担心网站。尚未犯下任何罪行，因此FBI在技术上无法对威胁采取任何措施。但是他们确实跟踪此类信息，也可能跟踪安全研究人员可以支持其他调查的内容。我花了几周的时间才找到合适的联系人并与我们联系。在确定他在相关工作组中并且他们确实跟踪了此信息并且对听到我们的发现感兴趣之后，我建议我们去喝咖啡并填写一些详细信息。我提供了一组潜在的位置，包括超好的代理商餐厅。</p><p> “Actually do you have an office or a conference room we can use?”</p><p> “实际上您有可以使用的办公室或会议室吗？”</p><p> Sure, I said. And this didn’t bother me because the phrase  let’s get coffee is always kind of figurative. To begin with, I don’t drink coffee.</p><p> 当然，我说。这并没有打扰我，因为“让我们喝咖啡”一词总是很具象。首先，我不喝咖啡。</p><p> A huge part of my job at USDS was coffee dates. The way we fought the bureaucracy was to build networks of people whose goals were aligned and whose skill sets or resources were compatible. The first contact with a new node was always informal. I needed to size you up, determine your incentives, your tolerance for risk, how you defined success. But I also needed to establish trust. I never thought to handle this situation any differently just because the FBI was on the other end of it.</p><p> 我在USDS工作的很大一部分是喝咖啡。我们与官僚作风的方法是建立目标一致，技能或资源兼容的人际网络。与新节点的第一次接触始终是非正式的。我需要确定您的规模，确定您的动机，对风险的承受能力，如何定义成功。但是我也需要建立信任。我从未想过要以其他方式处理这种情况，仅仅是因为FBI处于另一端。 </p><p> Anyway, the agent comes up to my office, he closes the door and takes out his badge. “I have to show you this first.”</p><p>无论如何，特工来到我的办公室，他关上门，拿出他的徽章。 “我必须首先向你展示。”</p><p> This seemed strange to me because I did not actually have any reason to believe he wasn’t who he said he was, but certain jobs will make you paranoid so I shrugged it off.</p><p> 这对我来说似乎很奇怪，因为我实际上没有任何理由相信他不是他所说的那个人，但是某些工作会使您产生偏执，所以我不予理会。</p><p> As we chatted, I noticed he was taking a lot of very thorough notes, which struck me as odd but — again — I dismissed. The conversation was friendly and productive. He set expectations appropriately. We agreed on how to follow up later. He stood up to leave, shook my hand, turned for the door, but stopped short as he touched the door knob.</p><p> 当我们聊天时，我注意到他正在记很多非常详尽的笔记，这使我感到奇怪，但是-再次-我被解雇了。对话友好而富有成效。他适当地设定了期望。我们同意以后如何跟进。他站起来离开，握住我的手，转向门，但是当他碰到门把手时停了下来。</p><p> “Oh wait, I forgot something. Could you raise your right hand for a minute?”</p><p> “哦，等等，我忘记了一些东西。你能举起右手一分钟吗？”</p><p>  “Everything you told me today is true to the best of your knowledge?”</p><p>  “就您所知，您今天告诉我的一切都是真实的吗？”</p><p> I looked at my still raised right hand.   Oh…….. “This is one of those things where if it isn’t I go to jail for a million years, right?”</p><p> 我看着仍然举起的右手。哦……..“这是我不入狱一百万年的事情之一，对吧？”</p><p>    Dazed, starting to appreciate that I might have accidentally bitten off way more than I could chew, I eventually wandered back to USDS HQ, which is a townhouse off of Lafayette Park just outside the White House. I ran into Matt Cutts in the foyer.</p><p>    茫然无知，开始意识到我可能不小心咬了太多东西，最终我回到了USDS HQ，这是位于白宫外拉斐特公园旁的联排别墅。我在休息室碰到了马特·库茨（Matt Cutts）。 </p><p>  “The strangest thing just happened,” I said before telling him the whole story. When I finished I realized that Matt was just  staring at me, completely silent. He stared at me like that for an uncomfortably long time.</p><p>“最奇怪的事情发生了，”我在告诉他整个故事之前说道。当我完成时，我意识到Matt只是凝视着我，完全保持沉默。他像这样盯着我，呆了很长时间。</p><p>      “I have two hundred employees, Marianne. It’s always you. No one else gets into these situations.  It’s always you. If someone had told me that one of my employees was hunting white supremacists with the FBI I wouldn’t have to ask who it was because, of course it’s you. It’s always you. Why is it always you?”</p><p>      “我有200名员工，玛丽安。永远是你没有其他人陷入这些情况。永远是你如果有人告诉我，我的一名员工正在与FBI一起寻找白人至上主义者，那么我就不必再问是谁了，因为当然是您。永远是你为什么总是你呢？”</p><p> People tend to think that the biggest deciding factor in their career is their talent or skill, but I don’t believe that. The way you process risk and handle fear has more impact on what kind of career you have than any other single factor. At USDS people saw me as something of a big game hunter. One of those few people always tied up on really critical national security type things, but I didn’t pursue those projects I just took opportunities that came across my desk and that other people were too scared to act on. With the FBI situation a large part of my ability to do that was rooted in ignorance. I didn’t stop to think that the FBI’s culture and process might assign a significance to my outreach that other organizations would not. But I also didn’t see myself as taking on this huge responsibility and all the corresponding risks. I was just there to connect two groups of people. To open the door for them so that they could get things done. I didn’t worry about whether I was qualified or capable of handling domestic white supremacists because I didn’t see that as my role. I trusted the researchers to be good at their jobs. I trusted the FBI to be good at their jobs.</p><p> 人们倾向于认为职业生涯中最大的决定因素是他们的才华或技能，但我不相信。处理风险和处理恐惧的方式对您所从事的职业的影响比其他任何单一因素都大。在USDS，人们将我视为一个伟大的游戏猎人。少数几个人总是把真正重要的国家安全问题束之高阁，但是我没有从事那些项目，我只是抓住了办公桌旁碰到的机会，而其他人也不敢采取任何行动。在联邦调查局的情况下，我这样做的能力很大一部分是由于无知。我一直不停地认为联邦调查局的文化和过程可能会给我的外展活动赋予重要的意义，而其他组织则不会。但我也不认为自己承担着巨大的责任和所有相应的风险。我只是在那里连接两组人。为他们打开门，以便他们可以完成工作。我并不担心自己是否有资格或有能力处理国内白人至上主义者，因为我不认为这是我的职责。我相信研究人员擅长于他们的工作。我相信联邦调查局擅长他们的工作。</p><p> A lot of getting people to perform well as their manager is about anticipating their decision making, and a lot of that is about understanding two things:</p><p> 促使人们表现出色的很多原因是他们的经理要期待他们的决策，而其中很多是要了解两件事：</p><p>  But it’s not just about managers considering their employees, surviving in an organization at any level involves anticipating the behavior of others. When people begin to take on leadership roles eventually they have to decide how they are going to handle fear. When you are the leader, you are the person who is held accountable for failure. The higher up you go, the more you are accountable for and the less you have control over it. Trust in you team is important, but your perception and acceptance of risk even more so. Leaders with a low tolerance for risk do not become leaders with a high tolerance for risk if you change their employees looking for trustworthy ones. Everybody wants to have this implicit , instinctual, don’t-need-to-think-about-it-and-never-doubt-it-for-a-second trust. That’s the gold standard. But most relationships of trust are formed because you just choose to set aside your doubts and trust, not because you have these great reservoirs of faith.</p><p>  但这不仅仅是管理者考虑员工，在组织的任何级别生存下来都涉及预期他人的行为。当人们开始担当领导角色时，他们最终必须决定如何处理恐惧。当您是领导者时，您就是负责失败的人。您走得越高，您承担的责任就越多，对它的控制权也就越少。对团队的信任很重要，但是您对风险的感知和接受就更重要。如果您改变员工寻找值得信赖的员工，那么风险承受能力低的领导者就不会成为风险承受能力强的领导者。每个人都希望拥有这种隐含的，本能的，不需要思考并且永远不会怀疑的信任度。那是黄金标准。但是，大多数信任关系之所以形成，是因为您只是选择摒弃怀疑和信任，而不是因为您拥有这些强大的信仰储备。</p><p> Leaders as they develop tend to break in one of two directions on risk. There are the leaders that — like samurai — embrace death. They see their role as protecting and empowering the people below them who do the real work and it’s an honor to serve the team’s interests even if things do not go well for them personally. In the best organizations the leader’s manager also does not fear death and they have the same safety as they grant to their people.</p><p> 领导者在发展过程中倾向于在风险的两个方向之一上突破。有些领导人像武士一样拥抱死亡。他们将自己的角色视为保护和授权自己下面的人做真正的工作，即使个人情况不佳，也很荣幸能够为团队的利益服务。在最好的组织中，领导者的经理也不惧怕死亡，他们拥有与授予员工相同的安全性。</p><p> But some people don’t process risk in that way. Those leaders get drawn into trying to outrun death, which is as impossible metaphorically as it would be literally. You can’t avoid taking responsibility forever. Eventually there will be some disappointment or mistake that you will be called on to answer for.</p><p> 但是有些人不会以这种方式处理风险。这些领导人被吸引尝试超越死亡，这在隐喻上和从字面上看都是不可能的。您无法避免永远承担责任。最终会有一些令人失望或错误的事情，您会被要求回答。 </p><p> The leaders who have a low tolerance for risk — and I say leaders instead of  managers because on engineering teams these concepts also apply to Staff and Principal engineers — will respond to risk by either avoiding it outright or figuring out how to spin the situation so that it is Not Their Fault(TM)</p><p>风险承受能力低的领导者（我说领导者而不是经理，因为在工程团队中，这些概念也适用于员工和首席工程师）将通过完全避免风险或弄清楚如何扭转局势来应对风险。这不是他们的错（TM）</p><p> These leaders ultimately become bureaucrats. The perfect job is the job with the glamorous title and the big paycheck where no decisions and no risks need to be taken. These leaders end up in startups more often than you might expect. That’s because continuing down a career where you’re running from death all the time does real damage to you psychologically. It’s important to understand that even though it seems like these people don’t care they are still human and they still have the same basic needs and feelings as anyone else. Fleeing death doesn’t just hurt the people they throw under the bus, it also hurts them. They want to be respected by their employees and often know they are not. They want to be admired and often know they are not. They also feel guilty screwing people over to survive.</p><p> 这些领导人最终成为官僚。完美的工作是具有光荣头衔和高薪水的工作，无需做出任何决定，也无需冒险。这些领导者进入初创企业的频率比您预期的要高。那是因为继续从事您一直死里逃生的职业，会对您的心理造成真正的伤害。重要的是要理解，即使这些人似乎不在乎他们仍然是人类，他们仍然具有与其他任何人相同的基本需求和感觉。逃亡不仅伤害了他们丢在公共汽车下的人，还伤害了他们。他们希望得到员工的尊重，并且经常知道自己没有得到尊重。他们想受到钦佩，常常知道他们不是。他们也感到内ing地将人们束之高阁以求生存。</p><p> When you are in a work situation where you are respected and admired, that is often its own reward. If you don’t have that, the components of your job that give you a sense of value and satisfaction are all connected directly to the career ladder. What is your title? What is the prestige value of your projects? How many people report up to you? How many people report up to them? How much are you getting paid? How much equity do you have? All that shit becomes very important because it is often all you have. People who flee death are in a state of constant anxiety. It’s like the worst form of impostor syndrome. They self soothe by climbing the career ladder. So even though a startup may seem like a poor fit if you don’t want to take on responsibility and just want to rubber stamp things all day, those opportunities are very attractive to leaders who fear death because the prestige of them is a substitute for the satisfaction of doing a good job.</p><p> 当您处在受到尊重和钦佩的工作环境中时，这通常是它自己的奖励。如果没有的话，可以带给您价值感和满意度的工作要素都直接与职业阶梯相连。你叫什么名字您的项目的声望价值是多少？有多少人向您报告？有多少人向他们举报？您得到多少钱？你有多少股份？所有这一切变得非常重要，因为它通常就是您所拥有的。逃离死亡的人们处于持续的焦虑状态。这就像最糟糕的冒名顶替综合症。他们通过爬上职业阶梯来自我安抚。因此，即使您不想承担起责任，只想整天加盖橡皮戳，对于初创公司来说似乎不合适，但对于那些惧怕死亡的领导者来说，这些机会还是很有吸引力的，因为他们的威望可以代替他们做好工作的满意度。</p><p> And once people start working that way it becomes a cycle that escalates. No one is born knowing how to run a 1,000 person engineering organization. People need time to build skills before they are ready for a promotion. If your actual job triggers enough fear and anxiety for you to betray the trust of your closest colleagues, you won’t do better one level up. The further beyond your area of competence you get, the worse the stress gets, the faster you need to run to escape death.</p><p> 一旦人们开始以这种方式工作，就会变成一个不断升级的循环。没有人知道如何运营拥有1000名员工的工程组织。人们在准备晋升之前需要时间来培养技能。如果您的实际工作引起足够的恐惧和焦虑，使您背叛了最亲密的同事的信任，那么您就不会做得更好。获得的能力越远，压力越严重，逃脱死亡的速度就越快。</p><p> Eventually you end up spending all your time trying to look busy, avoid responsibility and save face by scapegoating others. Meanwhile leaders who don’t fear death tend to have slower career progressions because they take more satisfaction from their actual jobs and focus on building skills that will make them better. The end result of this is that it often feels like everyone at the top is maliciously incompetent.</p><p> 最终，您最终将所有时间都花在试图显得忙碌，避免责任和与他人视线上来挽回面子。同时，不惧怕死亡的领导者往往会有较慢的职业发展，因为他们从实际工作中获得更多的满足感，并专注于培养可以使他们变得更好的技能。最终的结果是，通常感觉到每个高层都恶意地无能为力。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://bellmar.medium.com/why-is-this-idiot-running-my-engineering-org-c6e815790cdb">https://bellmar.medium.com/why-is-this-idiot-running-my-engineering-org-c6e815790cdb</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/运行/">#运行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/running/">#running</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
