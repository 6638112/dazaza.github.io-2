"note_en": "Self-improvement of the transhumanist sort requires that we adopt an entirely functional understanding of who and what we are: All of our abilities can be improved upon and all of our parts are replaceable. Upgradable.\n The quirks that make us human are interpreted, instead, as faults that impede our productivity and progress. Embracing those flaws, as humanists tend to do, is judged by the transhumanists as a form of nostalgia, and a dangerously romantic misinterpretation of our savage past as a purer state of being. Nature and biology are not mysteries to embrace but limits to transcend. This transhumanist mindset is, in fact, taking hold. We can see it in the way we bring digital technologies closer and closer. The screen is encroaching on the eye, from TVs to computer monitors to phone screens to smartwatches to VR goggles to tiny LEDs that project images onto the retina to neural implants that communicate directly with the optic nerve.\n With each leap in human\u2013machine intimacy, resolution increases, and our utility value is improved along some measurable metric. This is the mindset encouraged by wristbands that count our heartbeats and footsteps under the pretense of improved health or life extension. Health, happiness, and humanity itself are all reducible to data points and subject to optimization.\n  Like a music recording that can be reduced to code and stored in a file, the quantified human can also be reduced to bits, replicated infinitely, uploaded to the cloud, or installed in a robot. But only the metrics we choose to follow are recorded and translated. Those we don\u2019t value, or don\u2019t even know about, are discarded in the new model.\n Improved longevity, supercognition, or military prowess all sound promising until we consider what is being left behind, whose values are being expressed (and whose aren\u2019t), and how these choices change the larger systems of which we are a part. Just as life-saving antibiotics also strengthen bacteria and weaken the collective immune system, or as steroids improve short-term performance at the expense of long-term health, there are trade-offs. We\u2014or the companies selling the improvements\u2014are actively picking which features of humanity to enhance and which to suppress or ignore. In amplifying an individual\u2019s brainpower, we may inadvertently disable some of their ability to connect with others or achieve organismic resonance. What of racial diversity, gender fluidity, sexual orientation, or body type? The human traits that are not favored by the market will surely be abandoned.\n Could that happen to a civilization as supposedly enlightened as our own? Our track record suggests it will.\n The internet\u2019s tremendous social and intellectual potential was surrendered to short-term market priorities, turning a human-centered medium into a platform for manipulation, surveillance, and extraction. The more we see the human being as a technology to be enhanced, the greater the danger of applying this same market ethos to people, and extending our utility value at the expense of others. Life extension becomes the last-ditch attempt of the market to increase our available timeline as consumers\u2014and consumers willing to spend anything for that extra few years of longevity.\n Sure, many of us would accept a digital implant if it really worked as advertised. Who wouldn\u2019t want some painless enhancements, free of side effects? Or the choice of when or whether to die? Besides, participation in the ever-changing economy requires some acquiescence to technology, from streetcars and eyeglasses to elevators and computers.\n But our technological investments come with strings. The deals are not honest; they\u2019ve never been. Companies change their user agreements. Or they sell the printers at a loss and then overcharge us for the ink cartridges. The technologies we are currently bringing into our lives turn us into always-on customers\u2014more like subscribers than purchasers, never really owning or fully controlling what we\u2019ve bought. Operating system upgrades render our hardware obsolete, forcing us to buy new equipment. How long until that chip in my brain, and the neurons that grew around it, are obsolete?\n It\u2019s not that wanting to improve ourselves, even with seemingly invasive technology, is so wrong. It\u2019s that we humans should be making active choices about what it is we want to do to ourselves, rather than letting the machines, or the markets propelling them, decide for us.", "posttime": "2020-07-24 21:33:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u5f53\u4f5c,improvement,\u63d0\u9ad8", "title": "\u6211\u4eec\u628a\u81ea\u6211\u63d0\u5347\u5f53\u4f5c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5347\u7ea7", "title_en": "We\u2019re treating self-improvement like a software upgrade", "transed": 1, "url": "https://medium.com/team-human/were-treating-self-improvement-like-a-software-upgrade-b25a8e3a80c6", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u5f53\u4f5c", "\u63d0\u9ad8"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d3c99e3c2e29aab73ff4b8f986fc71cc.jpeg", "infoid": 1013951, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f(\u8def\u900f\u793e)-\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u822a\u7a7a\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40(FAA)\u5468\u4e94\u5bf92000\u67b6\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u6ce8\u518c\u7684\u6ce2\u97f3737 NG\u548cClassic\u98de\u673a\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7d27\u6025\u9002\u822a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8b66\u544a\u79f0\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u8150\u8680\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cc\u5f15\u64ce\u6545\u969c\u3002\n\u8be5\u6307\u4ee4\u6db5\u76d6\u8fde\u7eed\u4e03\u5929\u6216\u66f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u672a\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u98de\u673a\u3002\u5728\u68c0\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u98de\u673a\u5e26\u51fa\u4ed3\u5e93\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u7a7a\u6c14\u6b62\u56de\u9600\u53d7\u635f\u540e\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u822a\u7a7a\u5c40\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\n\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u822a\u7a7a\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u8150\u8680\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u98de\u673a\u6062\u590d\u670d\u52a1\u4e4b\u524d\u66f4\u6362\u9600\u95e8\u3002\n\u6ce2\u97f3\u516c\u53f8\u5468\u4e94\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5df2\u5efa\u8bae\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u68c0\u67e5\u98de\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u8865\u5145\u79f0\uff0c\u201c\u7531\u4e8e\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u75ab\u60c5\u671f\u95f4\u9700\u6c42\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u98de\u673a\u50a8\u5b58\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9600\u95e8\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u8150\u8680\u3002\u201d\n\u5728\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u65c5\u884c\u9700\u6c42\u540e\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u50a8\u5b58\u4e86\u6570\u5343\u67b6\u98de\u673a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u822a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8ba9\u4e00\u4e9b\u98de\u673a\u6062\u590d\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n\u8be5\u6307\u4ee4\u6db5\u76d6737 NG(600\u81f3900\u7cfb\u5217)\u548c737 Classic(737-300\u81f3737-500\u7cfb\u5217)\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6700\u8fd1\u6709\u56db\u4efd\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u6392\u6c14\u7b2c5\u7ea7\u6b62\u56de\u9600\u5361\u5728\u6253\u5f00\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u5f15\u64ce\u5173\u95ed\u3002\n\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u822a\u7a7a\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff0cAD\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u53f0\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u6392\u6c14\u7b2c5\u7ea7\u6b62\u56de\u9600\u7684\u8150\u8680\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u90a6\u822a\u7a7a\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u538b\u7f29\u673a\u5931\u901f\u548c\u53cc\u5f15\u64ce\u529f\u7387\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u3002\n\u6ce2\u97f3\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u673a\u961f\u6240\u6709\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5411\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u66f4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "note_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday issued an emergency airworthiness directive for 2,000 U.S.-registered Boeing 737 NG and Classic aircraft that have been in storage, warning they could have corrosion that could lead to a dual-engine failure.\n The directive covers planes not operated for seven or more consecutive days. The FAA issued the directive after inspectors found compromised air check valves when bringing aircraft out of storage.\n If corrosion is found,\u00a0the valve\u00a0must be replaced prior to the aircraft\u2019s return to service, the FAA said.\n Boeing said on Friday it had advised operators to inspect the planes and added \u201cwith airplanes being stored or used infrequently due to lower demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the valve can be more susceptible to corrosion.\u201d\n U.S. airlines stored thousands of airplanes after the coronavirus pandemic sharply reduced travel demand and some have been bringing some aircraft back into service as demand rises.\n The directive covering the 737 NG (600 to 900 series) and 737 Classic (737-300 to 737-500 series) was prompted by four recent reports of single-engine shutdowns caused by engine bleed air 5th stage check valves stuck in the open position.\n The FAA said the AD is to address corrosion of the engine bleed air 5th stage check valves for both engines. The FAA said that could result in compressor stalls and dual-engine power loss without the ability to restart.\n Boeing said it is providing inspection and replacement information to fleet owners if they find an issue.", "posttime": "2020-07-24 21:33:40", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u53d1\u5e03,classic,\u98de\u673a", "title":

As a tiny programming note, we\u2019re going back to posting some videos on YouTube in a few weeks, so make sure to peep  the TechCrunch channel if that\u2019s your jam.\n And we did  a special episode on the SPAC boom, if you are into financial arcana. For more on SPAC\u2019s \u2013&gt;  here\n The Equity crew tried something new this week, namely centering our main conversation around a theme that we\u2019re keeping tabs on: The resilience of tech during the current pandemic-led recession.\n Starting with the  recent economic news, it\u2019s surprising that  tech\u2019s layoffs have slowed to a crawl. And, as we\u2019ve recently seen, there\u2019s  still plenty of money flowing into startups, even if there  are some dips present on a year-over-year basis. Why are things still pretty good for startups, and pretty good for major tech companies? We have a few ideas, like the  acceleration of the digital transformation (more  here, and  here), and software eating the world. The latter concept, of course, is related to the former.\n After that it was time to go through some neat funding rounds from the week, including:\n Kibbo\u2019s shot at  making the #vanlife happen for more folks, something that we think is a good fit for the pandemic and the mobile professional.\n Sora\u2019s $5.3 million raise  for no-code HR connective tissue, something that I was rather bullish on but drew some chat about no-code itself, and if the trend is more hype than substance.\n All that and I have a newsletter launching this weekend that if you read, you will automatically be 100% cooler. It\u2019s called the TechCrunch Exchange, and you can snag it for free  here.\n Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PT and Friday at 6:00 a.m. PT, so subscribe to us on\u00a0  Apple Podcasts ,\u00a0  Overcast ,\u00a0  Spotify  and all the casts.", "posttime": "2020-07-24 21:11:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,gap,techcrunch", "title":

"note_en": "TikTok and the US-based National Music Publishers\u2019 Association (NMPA) have inked a multi-year licensing agreement.\n  According to the NMPA \u2013 whose members include all three major music publishers, plus the world\u2019s biggest indies \u2013 the deal \u201caccounts for TikTok\u2019s past use of musical works\u201d as well as setting up a \u201cforward-looking partnership\u201d.\n The first part of that phrasing suggests that TikTok has agreed to pay the NMPA a fee for unlicensed usage of its members\u2019 works in the past.\n  The second part (the bit about the \u201cforward-looking partnership\u201d) will give NMPA members the ability to opt-in to a licensing agreement which is effective retroactively as of May 1, 2020.\n The deal appears to have brought to a close mounting tensions between the NMPA and TikTok \u2013 with the former party publicly (and very deliberately) heaping pressure on the Bytedance-owned company.\n In October 2019, the NMPA called for the \u201cscrutiny\u201d of TikTok, writing that the video-sharing platform has \u201cconsistently violated US copyright law and the rights of songwriters and music publishers\u201d.\n And in April, according to a  Financial Times report, music publishers \u2013 via the NMPA \u2013 officially threatened to sue TikTok.\n At the time, David Israelite, CEO of the NMPA, told the FT that a lawsuit against TikTok for copyright infringement was a \u201clikely future step\u201d.\n As you\u2019d expect, Israelite\u2019s quote announcing today\u2019s news is rather more cordial.\n He said: \u201cWe are pleased to find a way forward with TikTok which benefits songwriters and publishers and offers them critical compensation for their work.\n \u201cMusic is an important part of apps like TikTok which merge songs with expression and popularize new music while also giving new life to classic songs.\n \u201cThis agreement respects the work of creators and gives them a way to be paid for their essential contributions to the platform.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with the NMPA to bring their member companies on to the platform and help hundreds of millions of people discover and enjoy their songs.\u201d\n Ole Obermann, Global Head of Music at TikTok, said: \u201cTikTok is proud to partner with music publishers and songwriters to enable artist and song discovery, and support revenue opportunities.\n \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with the NMPA to bring their member companies on to the platform and help hundreds of millions of people discover and enjoy their songs.\n \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with songwriters to help them use TikTok as a powerful and innovative channel to reach a global audience through a unique format of creation

On Wednesday, members of the staff have unanimously taken a stand by the dismissed editor-in-chief, describing Bodolai&#39;s decision as\u00a0 unacceptable.\n  For years, we&#39;ve been saying that there are two conditions for the independent operation of Index: that there be no external influence on the content we publish or the structure and composition of our staff. Firing Szabolcs Dull has violated our second condition. His dismissal is a clear interference in the composition of our staff,\u00a0  and we cannot regard it any other way but as an overt attempt to apply pressure on Index.hu.\n  Under these circumstances, following Bodolai&#39;s decision, the editorial board deemed that the conditions for independent operation are no longer in place and have initiated the termination of their employment.\n    The list

"note_en": "Amazon has been using the startup investment process to help it make its own competing products, according to a new report from  The Wall Street Journal&#39;s Dana Mattioli and Cara Lombardo.\n The Journal spoke with dozens of startup founders, investors, and advisers, who said Amazon met with or invested in their companies, only to later build its own products that directly competed with the smaller company. The Amazon-made products often went on to crush the competition, the Journal found.\n The Journal discovered several examples of Amazon&#39;s investments leading to in-house product development. LivingSocial, a deals website, told the Journal that after Amazon took a 30% stake in the company, it began requesting troves of data from the company, hiring away employees, and contacting LivingSocial&#39;s clients to offer better deals.\n In another example, investors from the Alexa Fund purchased a stake in the startup Nucleus, which made a video communication device for the home. Eight months later, after gaining access to Nucleus&#39; plans and financials, Amazon announced the Echo Show, an Alexa-enabled device with a large video screen. Sales of Nucleus&#39; consumer device quickly declined and the company has since pivoted to selling to the healthcare market, the Journal reports.\n   Amazon later settled with Nucleus for $5 million but did not admit any wrongdoing, according to the report.\n Other companies, like DefinedCrowd, Vocalife, and Ubi \u2014 which made a voice-operated speaker similar to the Echo \u2014 also told the Journal Amazon had met with them or invested in them, then later seemed to use their technology.\n In many instances, the smaller companies said they could no longer compete in the space, and downsized or closed.\n &#34;We ended up burning through our cash and ended up having to downsize most of the company,&#34; Leor Grebler, who created the voice-operated speaker Ubi, an Echo predecessor, told The Wall Street Journal.\n   Amazon told Business Insider that it does not use confidential information that companies share when Amazon invests to create competing products.\n &#34;For 26 years, we&#39;ve pioneered many features, products, and even whole new categories. From amazon.com itself to Kindle to Echo to AWS, few companies can claim a track record for innovation that rivals Amazon&#39;s,&#34; an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. &#34;Unfortunately, there will always be self-interested parties who complain rather than build. Any legitimate disputes about intellectual property ownership are rightly resolved in the courts.&#34;\n The Journal&#39;s report comes as Amazon is facing scrutiny about potentially anticompetitive behavior. The House Judiciary Committee is  holding an antitrust hearing on Monday at which Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and other prominent tech executives will testify.\n The Federal Trade Commission is also looking into &#34;hundreds&#34; of acquisitions by Amazon and other tech firms to determine whether they gained any unfair advantages by purchasing &#34;nascent competitors.&#34; The FTC has also spoken with sellers on Amazon&#39;s platform after  a Journal investigation from April found that Amazon used data from third-party vendors to launch competing products.\n  By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Business Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.", "posttime": "2020-07-24 20:46:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,amazon,\u538b\u57ae,reportedly", "title": "\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf9\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e13\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u538b\u57ae\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "title_en": "Amazon reportedly invested in startups and gained proprietary information before launching competitors, often crushing the smaller companies in the process", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-startup-investment-competitors-wsj-report-echo-nucleus-ubi-2020-7", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "amazon", "\u538b\u57ae"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "224751e443d59973e2b6d5d18c525439.jpg", "infoid": 1013945, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5468\u4e94\uff0cIndex\u7684\u4e09\u4f4d\u4e3b\u8981\u7f16\u8f91Attila T\u00f3th-Szenesi\u3001Veronika Munk\u548cJ\u00e1nos Ha\u00e1sz\u5df2\u5f00\u59cb\u7ec8\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728Index\u7684\u96c7\u4f63\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u670970\u591a\u540d\u8bb0\u8005\u5728\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n\u4ed6\u4eec\u505a\u51fa\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662fIndex.hu Zrt\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u62c9\u5179\u6d1b\u00b7\u535a\u591a\u83b1(L\u00e1szl\u00f3Bodolai)\u3002\u5df2\u7ecf\u89e3\u96c7\u4e86\u524d\u603b\u7f16\u8f91\u65af\u5179\u535a\u5c14\u8328\u8fdf\u949d\uff0c\u5e76\u62d2\u7edd\u6062\u590d\u4ed6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5468\u4e09\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u4e00\u81f4\u7ad9\u5728\u88ab\u89e3\u96c7\u7684\u4e3b\u7f16\u4e00\u8fb9\uff0c\u79f0\u535a\u591a\u83b1\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002\n\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8bf4\uff0c\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u8425\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6216\u6211\u4eec\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u89e3\u96c7\u6c89\u95f7\u7684\u65bd\u535a\u5c14\u8328\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u89e3\u96c7\u662f\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u5458\u5de5\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u660e\u663e\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u80fd\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u516c\u5f00\u8bd5\u56fe\u5411Index.hu\u65bd\u538b\u3002\n\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u535a\u591a\u83b1\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u518d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5f00\u59cb\u7ec8\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u96c7\u7528\u3002\n\u56e0\u4e3b\u7f16\u65af\u5179\u535a\u5c14\u8328\u79bb\u804c\u800c\u9012\u4ea4\u8f9e\u5448\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u540d\u5355\u6c89\u95f7\uff1a\n\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u6b27\u76df\u5206\u90e8EUROLOGUS\u7684\u56e2\u961f(\u963f\u62c9\u6258\u00b7\u62c9\u5179\u6d1b\uff0c\u798f\u5c14\u514b\u00b7\u683c\u5965\u5c14\u57fa\uff0c\u9a6c\u5c14\u987f\u00b7\u5df4\u62c9\u5179\uff0cSz\u0171cs\u00e1gnes\uff0c\u624e\u5170\u00b7\u57c3\u5179\u7279)", "note_en": "On Friday, the three leading editors of Index, Attila T\u00f3th-Szenesi, Veronika Munk, and J\u00e1nos Ha\u00e1sz have initiated the termination of their employment at Index, followed by more than 70 journalists working at the site.\n  The reason behind their decision was that L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bodolai, the president of the board of Index.hu Zrt. has  fired former editor-in-chief Szabolcs Dull and has  refused to reinstate him in order to secure the independence and future of Index despite the request from the site&#39;s editorial staff. On Wednesday, members of the staff have unanimously taken a stand by the dismissed editor-in-chief, describing Bodolai&#39;s decision as\u00a0 unacceptable.\n  For years, we&#39;ve been saying that there are two conditions for the independent operation of Index: that there be no external influence on the content we publish or the structure and composition of our staff. Firing Szabolcs Dull has violated our second condition. His dismissal is a clear interference in the composition of our staff,\u00a0  and we cannot regard it any other way but as an overt attempt to apply pressure on Index.hu.\n  Under these circumstances, following Bodolai&#39;s decision, the editorial board deemed that the conditions for independent operation are no longer in place and have initiated the termination of their employment.\n    The list

"note_en": "On Thursday, I quickly consumed and reported on  the first &#34;gameplay&#34; reveal of  Halo Infinite, the long-awaited sequel slated to launch this holiday on Xbox Series X. I&#39;ll admit, I really liked what I saw at first blush. Its combat, movement, and weapon impact struck a clever balance between the glory of  Halo 3 and the uneven-but-ambitious experiments of later sequels. (At least, as much as a five-minute sequence can demonstrate.)\n I also liked the new weirdness of the &#34;grapple shot,&#34; which lets series hero Master Chief cast a line and zip toward foes or pick up objects. I&#39;m a sucker for a grappling hook, and I have previously felt that another Xbox game series,  Gears of War, would benefit from such a gimmick. With that in mind, I went back to  my 2019 review of  Gears 5, where I&#39;d last suggested such a thing.\n I noticed that game&#39;s screenshots, which prompted me to look at images I captured from  Halo infinite. Then I looked at  Gears 5 again. And  Halo Infinite again.  Hmm, I said out loud.\n  It&#39;s officially time to talk about  Halo Infinite&#39;s gameplay world premiere, because something isn&#39;t adding up. The 2019 game  Gears 5, designed to max out the Xbox One console, currently looks superior to this year&#39;s  Halo Infinite, which is supposed to be the highlight for a brand-new, super-powerful console.\n As of press time, the game&#39;s developers at 343 Industries have yet to answer\u00a0Ars Technica&#39;s questions about the demo&#39;s visuals and performance. We&#39;re not alone: Commenters across our site and others exploded with everything from nitpicks to insults (along with memes in between), and while much of that discourse is trash, some of it has merit.\n    The problem arguably begins with  a 2018 reveal video that used the dubious descriptor of &#34;game engine demonstration.&#34; We saw a variety of virtual biomes whizz by, from sand-swept, bone-filled deserts to lush jungles, all full of detailed wildlife and rich fauna, before the series&#39; seminal Warthog vehicle appeared (along with a brief shot of that Master Chief guy everyone seems to love). This is  Halo Infinite! Boy, that sure looks next-gen. The fields were full of detailed grass; the valleys were lined with varied trees.\n One year later, the game received  a more cinematic reveal, the kind clearly built for hype. The short version: Master Chief&#39;s back; the classic Halo structure was damaged; he had worlds to save. This, too, was made from &#34;game engine footage,&#34; though this emphasized faces and up-close details, the kinds you&#39;d see in a non-combat story sequence. Maybe the next Xbox could look this good with real-time sequences? And how might this engine scale up to a next-gen console  and down to the original 2013 spec of Xbox One, since we were hearing more about cross-generational compatibility?\u00a0We didn&#39;t get those answers back then.\n   This week&#39;s  Halo Infinite reveal begins with yet another &#34;in-engine&#34; sequence: high-fidelity humans in a high-fidelity armor-construction facility. We see tight zooms of shiny Spartan armor and realistic, wrinkled faces complete with sparkling, lively eyes.\n After this intro, the camera blacks out, and we&#39;re treated to a &#34;press start to play demo&#34; message. From here, the sequence revs up to a 60fps refresh. For the first time with  Halo Infinite, we see a shaking camera, a mild aliasing of pixellated edges, and most importantly, some lower-fidelity geometry whizzing by. This is the look of actual gameplay. Remember, &#34;game engine footage&#34; is a tricky phrase, because you can build all kinds of glossy, realistic-looking content in a game engine without worrying about the hardware in question. A supercomputer can run the best &#34;in-engine&#34; content, with every reflective effect, particle-filled transparency trick, and massive dump of extra polygons, that might get removed from the version that runs on an older, less powerful game console.\n  But there&#39;s something weird about one physical construct that the demo reinforces over and over: a series of solid-gray pillars everywhere. Some of these, seen in the above image, have a &#34;wash&#34; of textured lines you might expect from a PS3 game. Others are solid-gray, like they&#39;d been imported from an N64 game. The amount of detail varies based on how close they are to the camera, and this &#34;level of detail&#34; (LOD) system, which auto-removes details based on distance from the game&#39;s camera, is pretty severe throughout the rest of the  Halo Infinite demo.\n  Grass comes and goes depending on the camera&#39;s position in the environment, as well, as evidenced by these images of a Warthog&#39;s drive:\n    The third image in that gallery pulls out to show a quizzical arrangement of trees, as well. They&#39;re identical in composition, which might make sense if they grew bunched together, but their sporadic placement doesn&#39;t make them appear organic in the environment. And that amount of vegetation absolutely pales compared to the game&#39;s 2018 engine reveal.\n There&#39;s also the matter of elements in the latest build&#39;s environment looking flat in general. Let&#39;s start with a comparison of &#34;the pilot,&#34; a new character introduced in the 2019 demo, between last year&#39;s reveal and this year&#39;s update:\n    The fidelity on his clothing&#39;s textures in the latest build is clearly high, beyond the average texture capacity of base Xbox One consoles. But the stark, flat lighting spread across his face makes him look plastic and artificial in the 2020 build. This quality is doubly emphasized by comparisons to the handsomely lit and occluded folds and bumps on his 2019 face. The geometry is nearly identical in both demos, and the comparison shows how much impact an unnatural lighting pass can have on everything else in a virtual environment.\n     These are just some of the many examples in the demo of objects failing to either receive realistic shadow or occlusion mapping, or effects not having\u00a0 any color or light impact on nearby environs. There&#39;s also the matter of these shots mostly consisting of the same repeating rocky textures.\n And if you think I&#39;m being too nitpicky, let&#39;s go back to the handsome game that started this whole comparison for me:  Gears 5, which launched with the base Xbox One as a target platform last year.\n    All of the above  Gears 5 images were captured on a high-end Windows PC, to be fair, but they&#39;re still reflective of the visuals you could expect on Xbox One consoles. There&#39;s also the matter of the game&#39;s &#34;wide linear&#34; approach: massive outdoor environments connect more finely tuned, carefully crafted battle zones, so you ride on a high-speed &#34;skiff&#34; from mission to mission. Its open world is decidedly lacking in detail compared to the crazier, dramatically lit missions in this gallery.\n  Yet  Halo Infinite promises to deliver a larger, more open campaign than any Halo game we&#39;ve ever seen. In a videoconference interview with Ars Technica, 343 staffers pledged that nearly any distant thing you might see in the game world, you should be able to reach\u2014much like in Nintendo&#39;s  Breath of the Wild. When asked pointedly about whether the new grapple shot would extend further for that purpose, or whether other tools or abilities would help Chief traverse this large world, the developers chose not to answer the question.\n Crafting such a vast, explorable world\u2014in such a way that can be rendered on everything from Xbox One to Xbox Series X\u2014is clearly no easy task. But this week&#39;s game reveal did little to emphasize an enormous scope, one whose scale might astound fans to the point that they&#39;d forgive repetitive geometry, aggressive LOD settings, or missing shadow and ambient occlusion effects. If that&#39;s the selling point, why not have Master Chief drive, drive, and drive some more\u2014perhaps while cranking up the Warthog&#39;s radio to soundtrack such an epic road trip?\n Instead, the video&#39;s selling points seemed to be the very things I described in my Thursday article: Combat, enemy movement, and weapon variety. And, sure, without those things nailed, there&#39;s no point to a Halo game. You can smother a universe in mystical deer and luscious grasslands all you want, bathed in pitch-perfect shadows, but if the gunplay behind such traversal feels shallow, fans will bail faster than you can say the word &#34; Destiny.&#34;\n Still, it&#39;s hard to argue that many things about  Halo Infinite&#39;s 2020 reveal seem rushed. As  former Easy Allies critic Kyle Bosman pointed out on Thursday, the ending sequence, in which a new series monster rants for an eternity about wanting to battle Master Chief, includes a garish polygon collision between its arm and chest:\n    Is such a visual mishap the end of the world for  Halo Infinite? Nah. But it puts a noticeable blemish on the sequence&#39;s finale, already made weird by this creature&#39;s squishy facial animations (and these look particularly lousy compared to  Gears 5&#39;s cinematic sequences). And it looks like the kind of glitch that a rushed, overworked staff either missed altogether or waved off, too busy knocking out even bigger bugs just to get this demo out the door during the insanity of developing a triple-A video game in the remote-workplace world of 2020.\n All of the above issues, for what is currently Xbox&#39;s only real &#34;statement&#34; game this holiday season alongside a new console, add up to serious question marks. Maybe the cross-generational promise of working on the older Xbox One should&#39;ve gotten the boot (or been altered so that the older console only reaches 30fps, instead of this video&#39;s admittedly smooth 60fps refresh). Maybe the promise of an open-world Halo wasn&#39;t worth the cost of so many visual cutbacks, especially compared to gorgeous first-party Xbox One games of the past few years.\n Or maybe this will all be moot when the game launches by year&#39;s end with both campaign and multiplayer packages hitting their marks, assuming the whole seemingly huge game doesn&#39;t get delayed beyond its &#34;holiday 2020&#34; release window.\n I mean, based on the above reveal footage,  Halo Infinite&#39;s not going to get delayed... right?

It is currently set to take off from Antartica in December 2023, and the main payload is an 8.4-foot telescope that will point itself at four primary targets, including two regions in the Milky Way where scientists have observed star formation activity.\n That telescope, the largest ever to be flown in this way, will be held aloft by a balloon that will measure roughly 400 feet wide, when fully inflated, with scientists on the ground able to precisely direct the orientation of the business end of the observation instrument. It\u2019s mission will include between two or three full loops around the South Pole, during a period spanning between three and four weeks as it drifts along high-altitude stratospheric winds. After that, the telescope will separate from the balloon and return to Earth slowed by a parachute so that it can potentially be recovered and reflow again in future to perform similar experiments.\n  While floating a balloon up to the edge of Earth\u2019s atmosphere might sound like more of a relaxed affair than launching a satellite using an explosion-propelled rocket, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab engineer Jose Siles said in an  agency release that balloon science missions are actually higher-risk than space missions, in part because many elements of them are novel. At the same time, however, they have the potential to provide significant rewards at a reduced cost relative to satellite launches on rockets.\n The end goal is for ASTRHOS to create \u201cthe first detailed 3D maps of the density, speed and motion of gas\u201d in these regions around newborn stars, in order to help better understand how they can impeded the development of other stars, or encourage the birth of some. This will be helpful in refining existing simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies, the agency says.", "posttime": "2020-07-24 20:22:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

Starting inthe upper left and going counter-clockwise: aggressivelyconventional-minded, passively conventional-minded, passivelyindependent-minded, and aggressively independent-minded.  I think that you&#39;ll find all four types in most societies, and thatwhich quadrant people fall into depends more on their own personalitythan the beliefs prevalent in their society. [  1]  Young children offer some of the best evidence for both points.Anyone who&#39;s been to primary school has seen the four types, andthe fact that school rules are so arbitrary is strong evidence thatthe quadrant people fall into depends more on them than the rules.  The kids in the upper left quadrant, the aggressively conventional-mindedones, are the tattletales. They believe not only that rules mustbe obeyed, but that those who disobey them must be punished.  The kids in the lower left quadrant, the passively conventional-minded,are the sheep. They&#39;re careful to obey the rules, but when otherkids break them, their impulse is to worry that those kids will bepunished, not to ensure that they will.  The kids in the lower right quadrant, the passively independent-minded,are the dreamy ones. They don&#39;t care much about rules and probablyaren&#39;t 100% sure what the rules even are.  And the kids in the upper right quadrant, the aggressivelyindependent-minded, are the naughty ones. When they see a rule,their first impulse is to question it. Merely being told what todo makes them inclined to do the opposite.  When measuring conformism, of course, you have to say with respectto what, and this changes as kids get older. For younger kids it&#39;sthe rules set by adults. But as kids get older, the source of rulesbecomes their peers. So a pack of teenagers who all flout schoolrules in the same way are not independent-minded; rather the opposite.  In adulthood we can recognize the four types by their distinctivecalls, much as you could recognize four species of birds. The callof the aggressively conventional-minded is &#34;Crush &lt;outgroup&gt;!&#34; (It&#39;srather alarming to see an exclamation point after a variable, butthat&#39;s the whole problem with the aggressively conventional-minded.)The call of the passively conventional-minded is &#34;What will theneighbors think?&#34; The call of the passively independent-minded is&#34;To each his own.&#34; And the call of the aggressively independent-mindedis &#34;Eppur si muove.&#34;  The four types are not equally common. There are more passive peoplethan aggressive ones, and far more conventional-minded people thanindependent-minded ones. So the passively conventional-minded arethe largest group, and the aggressively independent-minded thesmallest.  Since one&#39;s quadrant depends more on one&#39;s personality than thenature of the rules, most people would occupy the same quadranteven if they&#39;d grown up in a quite different society.  Princeton professor Robert George recently wrote: I sometimes ask students what their position on slavery would have been had they been white and living in the South before abolition. Guess what? They all would have been abolitionists! They all would have bravely spoken out against slavery, and worked tirelessly against it.\nHe&#39;s too polite to say so, but of course they wouldn&#39;t. And indeed,our default assumption should not merely be that his students would,on average, have behaved the same way people did at the time, butthat the ones who are aggressively conventional-minded today wouldhave been aggressively conventional-minded then too. In other words,that they&#39;d not only not have fought against slavery, but thatthey&#39;d have been among its staunchest defenders.  I&#39;m biased, I admit, but it seems to me that aggressivelyconventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionateamount of the trouble in the world, and that a lot of the customswe&#39;ve evolved since the Enlightenment have been designed to protectthe rest of us from them. In particular, the retirement of theconcept of heresy and its replacement by the principle of freelydebating all sorts of different ideas, even ones that are currentlyconsidered unacceptable, without any punishment for those who trythem out to see if they work. [  2]  Why do the independent-minded need to be protected, though? Becausethey have all the new ideas. To be a successful scientist, forexample, it&#39;s not enough just to be right. You have to be rightwhen everyone else is wrong. Conventional-minded people can&#39;t dothat. For similar reasons, all successful startup CEOs are notmerely independent-minded, but aggressively so. So it&#39;s no coincidencethat societies prosper only to the extent that they have customsfor keeping the conventional-minded at bay. [  3]  In the last few years, many of us have noticed that the customsprotecting free inquiry have been weakened. Some say we&#39;re overreacting that they haven&#39;t been weakened very much, or that they&#39;ve beenweakened in the service of a greater good. The latter I&#39;ll disposeof immediately. When the conventional-minded get the upper hand,they always say it&#39;s in the service of a greater good. It justhappens to be a different, incompatible greater good each time.  As for the former worry, that the independent-minded are beingoversensitive, and that free inquiry hasn&#39;t been shut down thatmuch, you can&#39;t judge that unless you are yourself independent-minded.You can&#39;t know how much of the space of ideas is being lopped offunless you have them, and only the independent-minded have the onesat the edges. Precisely because of this, they tend to be verysensitive to changes in how freely one can explore ideas. They&#39;rethe canaries in this coalmine.  The conventional-minded say, as they always do, that they don&#39;twant to shut down the discussion of all ideas, just the bad ones.  You&#39;d think it would be obvious just from that sentence what adangerous game they&#39;re playing. But I&#39;ll spell it out. There aretwo reasons why we need to be able to discuss even &#34;bad&#34; ideas.  The first is that any process for deciding which ideas to ban isbound to make mistakes. All the more so because no one intelligentwants to undertake that kind of work, so it ends up being done bythe stupid. And when a process makes a lot of mistakes, you needto leave a margin for error. Which in this case means you need toban fewer ideas than you&#39;d like to. But that&#39;s hard for theaggressively conventional-minded to do, partly because they enjoyseeing people punished, as they have since they were children, andpartly because they compete with one another. Enforcers of orthodoxycan&#39;t allow a borderline idea to exist, because that gives otherenforcers an opportunity to one-up them in the moral purity department,and perhaps even to turn enforcer upon them. So instead of gettingthe margin for error we need, we get the opposite: a race to thebottom in which any idea that seems at all bannable ends up beingbanned.  [  4]  The second reason it&#39;s dangerous to ban the discussion of ideas isthat ideas are more closely related than they look. Which means ifyou restrict the discussion of some topics, it doesn&#39;t only affectthose topics. The restrictions propagate back into any topic thatyields implications in the forbidden ones. And that is not an edgecase. The best ideas do exactly that: they have consequencesin fields far removed from their origins. Having ideas in a worldwhere some ideas are banned is like playing soccer on a pitch thathas a minefield in one corner. You don&#39;t just play the same gameyou would have, but on a different shaped pitch. You play a muchmore subdued game even on the ground that&#39;s safe.  In the past, the way the independent-minded protected themselveswas to congregate in a handful of places first in courts, andlater in universities where they could to some extent make theirown rules. Places where people work with ideas tend to have customsprotecting free inquiry, for the same reason wafer fabs have powerfulair filters, or recording studios good sound insulation. For thelast couple centuries at least, when the aggressively conventional-mindedwere on the rampage for whatever reason, universities were thesafest places to be.  That may not work this time though, due to the unfortunate factthat the latest wave of intolerance began in universities. It beganin the mid 1980s, and by 2000 seemed to have died down, but it hasrecently flared up again with the arrival of social media. Thisseems, unfortunately, to have been an own goal by Silicon Valley.Though the people who run Silicon Valley are almost all independent-minded,they&#39;ve handed the aggressively conventional-minded a tool such asthey could only have dreamed of.  On the other hand, perhaps the decline in the spirit of free inquirywithin universities is as much the symptom of the departure of theindependent-minded as the cause. People who would have becomeprofessors 50 years ago have other options now. Now they can becomequants or start startups. You have to be independent-minded tosucceed at either of those. If these people had been professors,they&#39;d have put up a stiffer resistance on behalf of academicfreedom. So perhaps the picture of the independent-minded fleeingdeclining universities is too gloomy. Perhaps the universities aredeclining because so many have already left. [  5]  Though I&#39;ve spent a lot of time thinking about this situation, Ican&#39;t predict how it plays out. Could some universities reverse thecurrent trend and remain places where the independent-minded wantto congregate? Or will the independent-minded gradually abandonthem? I worry a lot about what we might lose if that happened.  But I&#39;m hopeful long term. The independent-minded are good atprotecting themselves. If existing institutions are compromised,they&#39;ll create new ones. That may require some imagination. Butimagination is, after all, their specialty.               Notes  [  1]I realize of course that if people&#39;s personalities vary in anytwo ways, you can use them as axes and call the resulting fourquadrants personality types. So what I&#39;m really claiming is thatthe axes are orthogonal and that there&#39;s significant variation inboth.  [  2]The aggressively conventional-minded aren&#39;t responsible for allthe trouble in the world. Another big source of trouble is the sortof charismatic leader who gains power by appealing to them. Theybecome much more dangerous when such leaders emerge.  [  3]I never worried about writing things that offended theconventional-minded when I was running Y Combinator. If YC were acookie company, I&#39;d have faced a difficult moral choice.Conventional-minded people eat cookies too. But they don&#39;t startsuccessful startups. So if I deterred them from applying to YC, theonly effect was to save us work reading applications.  [  4]There has been progress in one area: the punishments for talkingabout banned ideas are less severe than in the past. There&#39;s littledanger of being killed, at least in richer countries. The aggressivelyconventional-minded are mostly satisfied with getting people fired.  [  5]Many professors are independent-minded especially in math,the hard sciences, and engineering, where you have to be to succeed.But students are more representative of the general population, andthus mostly conventional-minded. So when professors and studentsare in conflict, it&#39;s not just a conflict between generations butalso between different types of people.

"note_en": "\u201cBeing a creator of and steward for Flash as a platform was a privilege. I felt that we were building a pencil and it was the community of creators that was responsible for the creation of Flash as a creative form. Our job as stewards was to anticipate needs, listen and make sure it worked. The core idea of having an accessible system for creating interactive media content that works across a range of devices is still a powerful one. Just like pencil and paper is a powerful tool. I hope it will happen again. Many years ago, I had the idea of Flash Forever. How can we treat what is created in Flash as valuable information like a book? Sadly, the need to drive business growth by adding features and capabilities, trumped the need for permanence. It\u2019s great that Flash still lives in the skills and experiences of the community of people who learned and grew with it.\u201d\n  \u201cOver the years, my companies have made a number of software tools, but Flash was by far the most impactful. For me, the most gratifying thing has been having Flash animators thank me for giving them a career. Not just a tool, but a career. But the person that really is the one to be thanked is Jonathan Gay, the visionary behind Flash from day one and all the way until Adobe acquired it. Jonathan is an amazing man, and I was lucky to start working with him from the time he was a 17-year old in high school.\u201d\n  \u201cHaving grown up tinkering with animation software while programming text-based games, Flash was the first program that merged art and code in a way that I always hoped could be possible. Even better, anything you made could be played instantly on any computer via the web.     It was a magical time of experimentation and a lot of goofing off with friends found over the Internet. The moment was especially ideal for newcomers and outsiders, who now had a low barrier to entry and no industry gatekeeping. The joy of that era embodies what Newgrounds seeks to achieve to this very day; a place where people with no experience can learn, create and share wonderful things together.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash made the online game industry evolve, flourish and then explode. We played a small part, but it was a huge part of my life. I saw our games being played close to 3 billion times, with some including Bowman being played hundreds of millions of times. It is with great sadness I am witness to the death of Flash. Flash games made me, my business and altered my life. They allowed me to connect with the world and feel slightly less alone.\u201d\n  \u201cI owe my success as a game developer to Flash. My Rebuild series and my husband&#39;s Fantastic Contraption both started as Flash games played by millions of people freely in their browsers. That ease of sharing was so revolutionary - we went from buying games at the mall to just clicking a link! Flash gave all these small experimental games an instant audience, and gave rise to indie games as we know them today including my own.\u201d\n  \u201cFor me, Flash was an integral part of my game dev journey - a wonderful, eccentric piece of tech that I will always hold dear. I&#39;d been making games using various tools and languages since I was a kid but when Flash arrived on the scene it was a &#39;lightbulb moment&#39;, because I was a little bit of an artist, a little bit of a coder and this bridged that gap perfectly.   There just weren&#39;t any tools that I know of that allowed animators to make creations and coders to bring them to life. The fact that it compiled into this one tiny SWF file that could be distributed everywhere, (fonts, sounds, graphics and all!) just meant games could go viral in an instant and reach millions of players - which is exactly what happened when I launched the first Swords and Sandals game way back in 2007.   It&#39;s funny, I still find myself defending Flash against the lumbering and dreary HTML5 pipeline that proclaimed itself successor - even now, HTML5 gaming struggles to hold a candle to what Flash could do a decade ago with a lack of decent vector animation and inconsistent performance across browers.     Ten years after Steve Jobs declared it dead tech I still have a bunch of games on Steam made with AIR ( a sort of desktop &#39;successor&#39; to Flash ) that have sold well enough to allow me to build an indie games business and given me the freedom to continue the Swords and Sandals story - I owe Flash a huge debt, thanks for saving the universe (for me at least!)\u201d\n  \u201cThe old Flash scene was an incredible place to learn gamedev: it was a lively and fun community, and the content was free to access, but devs could still get paid for &#34;pretty much any project&#34; through the (honestly, kind of insane) sponsorship market - which also ended up handling distribution and marketing for you. These combined into a perfect storm of weird and unrestrained experimentation in all directions. I didn&#39;t realize until it was already over, but it was a tech bubble for strange art!\u201d\n  \u201cI was coming out of art school right when Flash was becoming popular and for me it was a way to create something and put it out in the world with no mediation \u2014 a Flash website was accessible to anyone with a web-browser. I would get emails from people at libraries enjoying my work! And I didn\u2019t really think of the things I was making as games \u2014 it seemed that a browser window could have absolutely anything inside of it, and it didn\u2019t need to be explained as long as it was compelling. To me, that element of surprise (or sometimes, confusion) is really magical. It probably had as much to do with the time as the technology, but it\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve tried to keep alive in my work ever since.\u201d\n  \u201cMy background is in visual arts and design so Flash was the perfect gateway drug to game making. It allowed me to start from simple animations, and gradually add more complex gameplays release after release. I still miss its timeline-based logic, its IDE, and its sharp vector rendering. Flash&#39;s streamlined workflow and huge ecosystem meant that I could make a game responding to an urgent issue in a matter of days and immediately make it accessible to an audience of millions. Tools and communities change all the time but certain kinds of Flash games are almost impossible to make with other tools, and the exuberant, fast and dirty world of online games has been only partially replaced by platforms like http://itch.io.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash as a platform gave &#34;outsiders&#34; an accessible tool to make games, but this wasn&#39;t the most important aspect: it was reach. It was mindblowing to put my game on Kongregate and have *thousands* of people play it overnight. This combo &#34;runs in browser + access to player community&#34; put a beginner, unknown, south american developer in the spotlight and allowed me to have a career in game development. It was just sad that Flash was in the hands of Adobe, who didn&#39;t know what to do with it and let it wither. HTML5 is still no replacement because it lacks the toolchain, it was a calamity when it died.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash games at their best had such a raw, personal connection to their creators. When playing them you could feel artist\u2019s hand, and the passion they poured into their work. Flash games and animations felt accessible, they had a way of making you think, \u2018Hey, I could do that!&#39; The effect was immediate and intoxicating. The first shape on your canvas, no matter how crude, had the potential to be given life.     For someone who made videos, stop motion animations, built contraptions, and generally felt the urge to just making something, Flash just felt like exactly what I needed. I\u2019ve heard \u2018I didn\u2019t know Flash could do that\u2019 a few times in regards to The Fancy Pants Adventures, but in reality, the series was shaped heavily by Flash\u2019s unique vector based, animation-centric workflow. I was able to build something that I felt was distinctly mine, while working around and also embracing my own strengths and weaknesses.     The insane reach, the community, the crazy creatives, nothing else comes close, and most people just have no clue how absolutely massive Flash was.     It\u2019s still almost impossible for me to wrap my head around the fact that I was able to create something that had an impact in the world, and Flash made that possible.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash had a huge influence on me as a game developer and designer. Relatively accessible code and very easy online sharing made game making a social activity, even when I didn&#39;t know a lot of other designers in person. Folks I met through making Flash games starting almost 15 years ago are still people I count as my very best friends. I have no idea what my life or career would look like without Flash. I also feel very honored and privileged to have had a hand in thousands of Flash games over the years by sharing my Flash game engine Flixel with other developers. Flash ruled and I miss it a lot.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash gave me the opportunity to be creative and ambitious with what I was making while I was still learning to use it. It taught me how I could make games with the most basic of coding ability, and then taught me something new with every little project I made. Once I started making games professionally, it gave me the tools to make something new and fresh on an almost monthly basis without ever feeling particularly restricted by the platform.     Unfortunately as technology advanced, Adobe either dragged or dug in their heels and refused to adapt. Casual gamers and our target audience moved to mobile platforms which we simply were not provided any meaningful tools to properly cater to until it was years too late and there were other engines and technologies better suited to it.     It became harder to make just a simple game and have it run well, and I found myself recommending to others to stay away or choose a different path.     What didn&#39;t change though, was the experience of making so many games in an industry that was just beginning to find its feet, and I find it influencing so many decisions I make now that I work as a designer at SEGA.     Making Flash games for Armor Games was one of the best experiences of my life, even if the fast pace sometimes did feel crushing, there was nothing more thrilling than releasing a game out to Armor, Newgrounds and Kongregate and seeing the mostly positive reviews roll in. I met some amazing people, and got the chance to do amazing things. I miss Flash, and the ease of prototyping something so quickly and easily and just having it work everywhere. I also miss all the players of the games I had, it was incredible seeing people react to something I&#39;d created and I still every so often hear from people who played one of my games and it&#39;s the best feeling in the world.     I&#39;ve heard from people that Apple helped kill of Flash by not supporting it on iPhone, but Adobe had years and years to adapt and constantly let the community down, and I wonder what the world of casual games would be like now if Flash was still a viable platform for developers to use. I have a suspicion that the democratisation of platform and development that was seen in the early flash days on web portals would mean a less stale corporate run culture around small free to play games these days.\u201d\n  \u201cFlash was a remarkable technology: an accessible programming tool that created games that you could play from almost any computer connected to the internet. Where Steam and Apple are often credited with democratising development, an incredible number of developers entering the industry around that time had already learned that anyone could make games that could become &#39;a hit&#39; via Flash and the many Flash games portals around.     Each technology shapes the work created in it, through the things that are easy to achieve in it, the opportunities of what is possible in it, and the challenges from what is not possible in it. Flash was an incredibly fast 2D animation tool, and the limitations of the internet in the Flash era limited the filesize you could expect players to wait for. This gave Flash a primary aesthetic of fast, 2D action games - and seeking to stand out within that space, a huge amount of experimentation and iteration followed. As the community found tricks and shortcuts, new possibilities would open up, and new experiments would follow. The community turned into a self-growing organism, ever seeking the ever-expanding possibilities of the space - some excelled in animation, others in design, others in creation speed, others in humor, and again others in technology. Whatever your focus, there were others chasing that same dream, appreciating your efforts - and that felt exciting.     It wouldn&#39;t be an exaggeration that Vlambeer, and with it games as Super Crate Box, Ridiculous Fishing, LUFTRAUSERS, and Nuclear Throne, would not have existed without Flash. We made our first dollar via Flash, and earned the money we needed to keep the studio afloat for the first few years via Flash. I know for a fact that we&#39;re not the only one. Many people I would consider indie legends today would not have been able to create their defining works, or sustain their passion projects without messing around in Flash.\u201d\n  \u201cI was doing a PhD in BioChemistry back in 2008. I was conducting experiements where I needed to press a button every 5 minutes for over 6 hours. I started playing flash games to pass the time. They were so simple, accessible and fun that after a while I was drawn to making one.  I followed some tutorials and code examples (thanks Keith Peters!) and made a couple of games. They were played hundreds of thousands of times and I was instantly hooked. I never finished the PhD. I could no longer motivate myself to spend years writing something that will be read by 1 or 2 people if I\u2019m lucky when instead I could spend a week making something silly and fun that 100k+ people would play. I\u2019ve been making web games for over a decade now and they\u2019ve been played around a billion times. I will never forget the start of my journey. Thinking up a bonkers new game idea, throwing it together then putting it on Kongregate and Newgrounds to see what people think. It was the golden age of indie game development in my opinion. The most creative and fun ideas got the most attention no matter who made them. No need for a marketing budget and definitely no in-app purchases etc. I\u2019ve closed my flash site now (TheGameHomepage.com) to focus on my new(er) HTML5 game site FreeGames.org. I\u2019ve had a few hiatuses and a job in between but I\u2019m still making web games 12 years later!\u201d\n  \u201cA lot of new indie studios were popping up all across Indonesia in 2010. The main driving factor was Flash games. Flash games and its sponsorship business model had opened doors for Indonesians to create games and earn a decent living from web-based games. For Indonesians, making Flash games were the closest thing to being a \u201creal\u201d game developer. There were no big AAA studios nor schools with game development courses in Indonesia back then, even now access to game development knowledge is still very limited. And to make things even harder, games are still considered \u201cbad\u201d and not a legit career path in the eyes of parents, teachers, and government officials in Indonesia.     Many Indonesians who dreamt of working in the games industry or wanted to create their own games turned to Flash games and started forming studios or teams, I was one of them. The best thing was, you don\u2019t need a lot of capital to start making Flash games and you can earn a pretty decent living in Indonesia. To put things into perspective, a simple Flash game that a single developer worked on for less than a month could get US$500 - US$1000 in sponsorships and ads, while the standard salary for a university fresh graduate in Jakarta was about Rp 3,000,000/month (US$200/month in today\u2019s currency), even less if you live outside of Jakarta. The higher quality Flash game could even earn US$20K and more.     In this era, Indonesian game developers released many notable games and hits, such as the Epic War series from Artlogic games, Infectonator and Necronator series from Toge Productions, Valthirian Arc series from Agate, and many more. These games were being played by millions of people worldwide and their success helped the growth of Indonesian games industry.\u201d\n  \u201cI started making Flash games when I was 18. It was just a hobby, because I loved video games, was a computer science student and always wanted to make my own game. Flash was the easiest tool to do it, and it also had a huge community which could actually play the game and provide some feedback.     And the feedback from players became the most valuable thing for me. It inspired me to move further, make bigger, better and more detailed games. For example, Feudalism III had an AI system equal to Final Fantasy XII or Dragon Age: Origins, with unique settings for every one of 184 types of units. The feedback also really helped to improve my English ;)     I\u2019ve been making Flash games fulltime for 10 years (2004 \u2013 2014), and it was the best part of my life. In 2014, when the flash started slowly dying, I\u2019ve accidentally found an opening in big company making AAA games. I\u2019ve decided to give it a try \u2013 mostly because I was curious if my skills would interest them. Surprisingly, they did! Since then I was even promoted to a lead UI programmer. So, I\u2019m still a game developer, but currently as a part of big team.\u201d\n  \u201cI basically grew up on Newgrounds and developed an interest in making my own games very early on. I begged my parents to buy Flash (I believe the first version I got was Macromedia Flash MX 2004) and they were very skeptical of the cost, a few hundred dollars IIRC, but they got it for me for my 13th birthday.     I made a few low quality games which are lost to the ether, and then I started releasing some slightly better games under the name IcyLime. I made Multitask in 2009 when I was 15. Actually it only took about 10 days to make, and I figured it would get maybe a few hundred, or maybe even a thousand views.     Multitask ended up getting over 10 million views across different sites like Kongregate, Newgrounds, ArmorGames, and others. I was overwhelmed and had NO idea how to properly monetize it at the time so I gave away licenses for less than market value, but since then it has still made around $15,000. I then made a few other games including Multitask 2 before life took over, and I never had time to return. I credit Flash for guiding me to my career path as a software developer, although I no longer have as much of an interest in making games specifically.\u201d\n  \u201cLong before Mario Maker was a thing, N by Metanet Software offered a level editor, and I submitted a couple hundred of my own designs to nmaps.net, where the community would play them and give feedback. My college offered a quality game design program, but I unironically learned more from this one little community of players and designers.\u201d\n  \u201cI was basically a kid during the Flash-era, and I feel like I grew up alongside it. I would always frequent Newgrounds as I was enthralled by all the amazing content people were uploading and the community around it all. I would mess-around on the computers at school slowly teaching myself both animation and scripting with dreams of also uploading my own content one-day.     The first &#39;game&#39; I ever made was entirely based off someone else&#39;s scripts they had uploaded for public use. I kept tweaking the code and drawing art, learning as much as I could but honestly just having fun; the concept of being a real game developer just didn&#39;t exist in my mind. Eventually I released my first serious game and people loved it, and that blew me away. So I kept doing it. A decade later and I&#39;ve since changed careers to pursuing game development professionally, still learning and still honestly just having fun. Flash made that possible.\u201d\n  \u201cNitro\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-24 19:17:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,games,flash",

"note_en": "A federal judge has temporarily blocked federal law enforcement officers deployed to Portland, Ore., from targeting journalists and legal observers at the protests against police violence and racial injustice that have  intensified in recent days.\n  U.S. District Judge Michael Simon issued a  restraining order Thursday preventing federal agents from &#34;arresting, threatening to arrest, or using physical force&#34; directed at anyone they know to be a journalist or legal observer, unless they have probable cause to believe they have committed a crime.\n  The order also blocks the defendants from seizing any photographic, audio and video recording equipment and press passes from people in those two categories, as well as from ordering them to stop recording or observing a protest.\n    The order comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, on behalf of a group of legal observers and local journalists.\n  They wrote that they were seeking to stop local and federal defendants from attempting to intimidate the press and &#34;assaulting news reporters, photographers, legal observers, and other neutrals who are documenting the police&#39;s violent response to protests over the murder of George Floyd.&#34;\n       The order details several examples of journalists, identifiable by press passes, clothing and gear, being fired upon, pepper sprayed and hit with batons by federal agents. They described being shot with pepper balls and what are identified as &#34;less lethal munitions.&#34;\n  In one instance, Noah Berger, a photojournalist of 25 years on assignment for the Associated Press, describes being attacked repeatedly by federal agents with batons and pepper spray, even as he was clearly not participating in the protest and, in a later incident, leaving the area.\n  The order also detailed the story of photojournalist Jungho Kim, who has covered protests in California and Hong Kong and has experience &#34;distinguishing himself from a protester.&#34; Kim was recording protesters on the scene when federal agents pushed them away from the area.\n  &#34;He was around 30 feet away from federal agents, standing still, taking pictures, with no one around him,&#34; reads the order. &#34;He asserts that suddenly and without warning, he was shot in the chest just below his heart with a less lethal munition. Because he was wearing a ballistic vest, he was uninjured. He also witnessed, and photographed, federal agents firing munitions into a group of press and legal observers.&#34;\n  Thursday&#39;s order adds the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Marshals Service, the federal defendants, to an  existing injunction that bars Portland police from arresting or attacking journalists and legal observers at protests.\n  &#34;This order is a victory for the rule of law,&#34;  said Jann Carson, interim executive director of the ACLU of Oregon. &#34;Federal agents from Trump&#39;s Departments of Homeland Security and Justice are terrorizing the community, threatening lives, and relentlessly attacking journalists and legal observers documenting protests. These are the actions of a tyrant, and they have no place anywhere in America.&#34;\n  The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening.\n  In a Thursday  press release describing the situation in Portland, the department said federal law enforcement officers are working &#34;diligently and honorably&#34; to enforce federal law by defending federal property and the lives of fellow officers against &#34;violent anarchists&#34; rioting in the streets.\n  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service deployed officers earlier this month to guard federal buildings in Portland, where demonstrators have taken to the streets for more than 50 consecutive days to protest racial injustice and police brutality.\n  Since then, federal agents have come under fire for attacking and detaining protesters, in some cases  using unmarked vehicles and failing to identify themselves while taking individuals into custody.\n  On Wednesday night, Portland Mayor  Ted Wheeler was among a crowd of protesters that federal agents tear gassed.\n     State and  local leaders have said that the presence, and violence, of federal agents in the city have worsened a situation that was tense to begin with.\n  &#34;There&#39;s absolutely no question that by having the presence of federal officers here, it&#39;s simply like adding gasoline to a fire,&#34; Oregon Gov. Kate Brown told NPR on Sunday.\n  In his order, Simon called the federal agents&#39; actions &#34;part of a pattern of officially sanctioned conduct,&#34; and said they would continue to target journalists and legal observers without an injunction.\n    Other groups are seeking to put an end to the presence of federal law enforcement in Portland and elsewhere.\n  The mayors of  more than a dozen cities sent President Trump a letter this week, calling on his administration to withdraw federal agents. The ACLU of Oregon filed a  lawsuit on Wednesday against the DHS, U.S. Marshals Service and the city of Portland for attacking volunteer street medics.\n  And the Justice Department&#39;s Office of the Inspector General on Thursday announced  an investigation into allegations that DOJ law enforcement personnel have improperly used force in responding to protests in Portland and Washington,

"note_en": "With  Hamilton on my mind, I had a fanciful thought while reading the new book  Love Drugs: The Chemical Future of Relationships. The Founding Father, stressed and tired and focused on getting his bill for a national bank through Congress, could have saved himself a lot of grief if, in his moment of weakness with the temptress Maria Reynolds, he\u2019d had an anti-love drug to cool his loins. Instead his response to her feminine wiles, as conjured by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is to pray, \u201cLord, show me how to say no to this.\u201d It didn\u2019t prove effective.\n  Love drugs harken back to fairytale fantasies about potions and spells, but the notion isn\u2019t purely fiction. The authors of  Love Drugs\u2014Julian Savulescu, an Oxford philosopher, and Brian Earp, a Yale doctoral candidate in philosophy and psychology\u2014make plain that our brain\u2019s love, lust, and attachment systems can be affected by real-life neuro-technologies. With cogent arguments, vivid experimental detail, and engaging storytelling, the authors show that chemical interventions to foster, enhance, and diminish love will only become more sophisticated as scientists discern the biochemical nature of the romantic bond.\n  Aficionados of Aldous Huxley\u2019s  The Doors of Perception and  Brave New World will find  Love Drugs both entertaining and sobering. In fact,  Love Drugs was almost titled  Brave New Love. \u201cThere is a part of me that still prefers  Brave New Love,\u201d Earp says. \u201cI think a lot of people think this is a pro-love drugs book. We tried not to do that. This is not \u2018science will fix all of our problems.\u2019 A title like  Brave New Love says, \u2018There\u2019s a real danger here.\u2019 Maybe if I could wave a magic wand I\u2019d go back to  Brave New Love. But it is what it is.\u201d\n  I was excited to speak to Earp, a research fellow in the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford. I first learned of him in 2011 from YouTube. At the time, Earp was getting his master\u2019s degree in psychology at Oxford, which was where philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris happened to be giving a talk on his then-new book  The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values. Earp, skeptical of the ostensible novelty of his thesis, incisively asked him to defend it. The  recording of the exchange has almost 2 million views. In our conversation, Earp didn\u2019t disappoint. He was as thoughtful and careful and smart in his responses to me as I expected him to be.\n      One possibility is that people will begin to see that love is something that is at least partly in our command. Many believe the opposite is the case, that love is a mysterious thing that just happens to you if you meet the right person. You might fall into and potentially fall out of love, but there\u2019s not much you can really do about it. There\u2019s something about this view that is potentially immature, in that it may prevent us from exercising our agency to try to work on the love that we share with someone to whom we\u2019re committed. We\u2019re never going to have a magic potion, like in  A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, that just causes you to feel a certain kind of love for somebody. But we can nudge the probability that we\u2019ll have a certain kind of loving relationship with someone, or they will be able to enhance certain aspects of that loving relationship.\n    The attachment system is underwritten by oxytocin and vasopressin, and some other neurochemicals. Lots of things go into libido. One of them is testosterone, and testosterone levels can be manipulated. Similarly, serotonin is involved in attraction. People have noticed that there are similarities in certain aspects of feeling in the early stages of attraction to somebody and in obsessive compulsive disorder. Both of these things seem to turn on serotonin levels.\n    You can\u2019t tweak these things like independent knobs. Instead we have these really big blunt-style effects that operate across multiple systems. If you depress libido with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for example, you can lose interest in being physically intimate with your partner. That means you\u2019re not going to be releasing oxytocin as you would naturally. That has potential to degrade your attachment bond over time. You can start to have a looping effect. On the other hand, if you\u2019re riddled with depression, and you\u2019re among the subset of people for whom SSRIs are helpful in treating the symptoms of depression, maybe you\u2019re lucky that the SSRI doesn\u2019t diminish your libido. In that case, one and the same drug could potentially be a relationship helper.\n  You write about the potential benefits of psychoactive drugs. How can they affect our love systems?\n  The psychedelics and MDMA, or ecstasy, are more global drugs. You wouldn\u2019t use them for a precise intervention on a subroutine of your neurochemistry. Rather they have a global effect in altering our disposition toward our partner and our emotions, where we can engage meaningfully with the content of our relationship. MDMA can cause feelings of warmth and closeness, at least under the influence of the drug. But it can also cause a sense of openness to talking about emotions that otherwise might be scary to talk about. People in recent trials say they feel more loving toward those around them, more interested in taking things from other people\u2019s perspective, and more mentally flexible, so that if somebody says something that might have hurt their feelings before, they don\u2019t immediately take it in just that one way.\n  What\u2019s going on in our brains that might explain how psychedelics can help our love lives?\n  Our view is the brain is a big Bayesian prediction mechanism. We try to predict what\u2019s going on in the world as efficiently as possible. Once we notice certain patterns or regularities, we just store that as an expectation. Then we continue to interpret the world in light of those prior beliefs. But some of these prior beliefs can just be ruts that we get stuck in. I\u2019ve had a certain number of arguments with my partner, and I just start to interpret everything that they say in light of my prior conclusions about what was going on, rather than being able to hear them in a new way. I just can\u2019t be bothered or I\u2019m too defensive or whatever it is. What psilocybin seems to do is temporarily wash out some of these prior assumptions so that you are seeing anew, you\u2019re taking in information without prejudging it as much as you might have in the past. So for people who are stuck in a rut, who can\u2019t seem to talk their way out of a rut, having a drug that directly suppresses these problematic priors and allows you to look at the world with fresh eyes could be really helpful.\n A chart\u2019s purpose is usually to help you properly interpret data. But sometimes, it does just the opposite. In the right (or wrong) hands, bar graphs and pie charts can become powerful agents of...  READ MORE\n    It seems like love drugs are ripe for abuse. They\u2019re not a panacea. They\u2019re not something that just everybody should try. They have to be used under particular circumstances, where people have been properly screened. And we have to keep developing the evidence for when, and under what conditions, they\u2019ll be helpful rather than harmful. It\u2019s easy to get carried away because some of these drugs, the psychedelics, are very powerful. Many people who try them feel transformed by them. We need to decide what we want our future to look like. We haven\u2019t even taken care to properly study the interpersonal effects of medications we already use. That\u2019s a risk that is unfolding under our very noses. For the most part, we\u2019re just stumbling along without thinking carefully about the ethical and the normative implications of using love drugs.\n    There\u2019s a small pilot study happening where some of the researchers who are involved in psilocybin for PTSD trials are bringing in the PTSD sufferer\u2019s partner, and both of them are undergoing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy. A couple first has multiple interactions with a therapist to establish the therapeutic relationship. They\u2019ll talk about what they hope to get out of the experience. They\u2019ll be counseled on the effects these drugs can have. Part of the effect of the drug is how you relate to what\u2019s going on when you\u2019re in an altered state of consciousness in a therapeutic context. Then, separately, each one will be made comfortable, probably given eyeshades and some headphones, and they\u2019ll take a dose of the drug. With the therapist there to help respond to any concerns that may arise, the couple will reflect on their own emotions. They will talk with the therapist and then with each other, when they\u2019re ready, about how they\u2019re going to implement whatever lessons they feel they\u2019ve learned as the effects of the drug are wearing off. In some cases, people report that six months or a year after their sessions they still feel more mentally flexible and more able to deal with conflict in a productive manner.\n  If someone says that using love drugs is an easy solution that avoids the tough work of a loving relationship, how do you respond?\n  One reason why people have that worry is they think that if something feels like a quick fix, it simply won\u2019t work or won\u2019t be effective over the long run. Or it will be a replacement for dealing with the underlying issues that are really important. I would agree with that. But if there\u2019s a drug that enhances your ability to engage with what\u2019s really going on with the relationship, and that therefore makes it more likely that the changes you make are going to be long-lasting and rooted in a genuine understanding of what\u2019s good for the both of you, then it\u2019s harder to raise that kind of criticism.\n  You worry that interventions in the biological side of love could be used to homogenize the sexual landscape. How could that be done?\n  Jewish yeshiva students, for example, are being prescribed SSRIs supposedly to treat their depression. But the reason why they\u2019re depressed is because they have same-sex attraction or desire to masturbate, and that\u2019s forbidden in their communities. They\u2019re constantly feeling shame. And then, as a \u201chelpful\u201d side effect of this drug treatment, it also will likely lower their libido, which will make it easier for them to not masturbate or not want to become sexually involved with the wrong person, according to the norms of the society. This is an example where a drug is currently being used to have anti-sexual effects on sexual-orientation minorities within religious communities. And it\u2019s quite explicit, the point of it. It\u2019s not a wink-wink, nudge-nudge. The psychiatrists and the rabbis are getting together to lower the libido with the drug.\n Are you skeptical about whether love drugs can be used, developed, and marketed in an ethical, responsible manner, given the sort of profit-driven pharmaceutical environment we have right now?\n  Sure. There will almost certainly be problematic pharmaceutical involvement in any development of any new drug. We need to wake up, and figure out what our response is to the ability of pharmaceutical companies to pathologize our lives as a way of hawking their wares.\n    One way to diffuse the problem of pharmaceutical companies coming up with diseases that they can use to explain why people need their drug, is by decoupling the concept of applying a medical technology and treating a disease. We support an enhancement model of medicine, where we think treating a disease is just one of the ways that we can improve our lives with technology. If I go to work on my relationship with a couples\u2019 counselor, I\u2019m not admitting to having a relationship disorder. The same thing should be true for drug use for enhancement purposes. If there\u2019s a way that a person or a couple could have access to a drug that, if used in the right therapeutic context, could help improve their life, we need to talk about what that model would look like in society, whereby we don\u2019t first have to conjure up some sort of disorder that we think that they have, so that we can justify giving them access to the drug.\n    No. I like how the philosopher Carrie Jenkins understands love in her book  What Is Love: And What It Could Be. She doesn\u2019t collapse into saying love is just an animalistic drive. Like so many things, love\u2019s a biopsychosocial phenomenon. Much of our cultural narrative about love is based on psychological, subjective, experiential aspects. It\u2019s only in the last few decades that we\u2019ve even been able to see what\u2019s going on biologically and neurochemically. She says any full understanding of love is going to require that we appreciate what\u2019s going on at these different levels of analysis. How we both experience and express our own emotions surrounding love is shaped by cultural factors, and that can have effects down on the level of biology and back up again.", "posttime": "2020-07-24

"note_en": "SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working with sound. It consists of:\n scsynth, a real-time audio server with hundreds of unit generators (&#34;UGens&#34;) for audio analysis, synthesis, and processing\n sclang comes with its own package manager, called Quarks. scsynth and supernova both support third-party plugins via C and C++ APIs.\n SuperCollider is written in C++11 using several third-party libraries, including Qt and Boost. It can be used on Windows, macOS, a variety of Linux and BSD distributions, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black.\n  macOS and Windows builds for stable releases are provided at our  downloads page. See the  macOS README and  Windows README for instructions on usage, and how to build SC yourself.\n To get the latest stable version, Linux users will need to build SuperCollider themselves. See the  Linux README for instructions.\n See the  Raspberry Pi and  BeagleBone Black READMEs for instructions on building on those platforms.\n          The official docs can be viewed in the SuperCollider IDE&#39;s built-in documentation browser. You can also view them online at  doc.sccode.org.\n    You can  sign up for mailing lists, and view the archives for  sc-users and  sc-dev.\n    Development of SuperCollider happens here on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving SuperCollider.\n  Please read our adopted  code of conduct before contributing, so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n  Read our  contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes.\n  To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of  good first issues that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started. You can also ask on our developer&#39;s mailing list, on  Slack, or on the  forum.\n  SuperCollider uses a Requests for Comment (RFC) system to propose, design, and discuss &#39;big&#39; changes. Submitting a new RFC or discussing an existing one is a great way to get involved, especially if you are looking for a way to contribute that doesn&#39;t involve writing code or using a terminal. You can learn more at the  RFC repository.\n  SuperCollider is free software available under Version 3 the GNU General Public License.

"note_en": "It&#39;s great when people get excited about things, but sometimes they get a little  too excited. This an awesome (rigorous and respectful) and curated (I read every suggestion and make judgement calls) list of cold showers on overhyped topics. This does  not mean the enthusiasm is bad or wrong: we&#39;re just reminding people to stay grounded. Feel free to submit your favorites!\n  Hype: &#34;Formal Verification is a great way to write software. We should prove all of our code correct.&#34;\n Shower: Extensive literature review showing that formal methods are hard to learn, extremely expensive to apply, and often miss critical bugs.\n Caveats: Written in 2000 and doesn&#39;t cover modern tools/techniques, such as TLA+ or dependent typing.\n Notes: Part of  Peter Gutmann&#39;s thesis, &#34;The Design and Verification of a Cryptographic Security Architecture&#34;.\n  Shower: A review of all the available literature (up to 2014), showing that the solid research is inconclusive, while the conclusive research had methodological issues.\n Caveats: Does not cover other possible benefits of static typing, like documentation. Does not address research on gradual type systems, like mypy or Typescript.\n  Shower: Benchmarking cutting-edge graph-processing algorithms running on 128-core clusters against a single-threaded 2014 Macbook Pro. The laptop consistently wins, sometimes by an order of magnitude.\n Caveats: McSherry is really good at optimizing his algorithms and has skills the average data scientist does not. Big data systems might be better if you have ad-hoc queries and don&#39;t want to take the time to optimize them.\n Notes: &#34;If you are going to use a big data system for yourself, see if it is faster than your laptop. If you are going to build a big data system for others, see that it is faster than my laptop.&#34;\n  Caveats: Raw data you have to interpret yourself.  Does not provide a complete dump of the raw data for your own analysis. Raw data can now be found  here\n Notes:  Continually updating with new benchmarks. All implementations are public and you can improve them with a PR.\n  Shower: Review of all the different styles of Agile and how some of the practices (particularly replacing requirements with user stories and the lack of proper specification) are harmful in the long run.\n Caveats: While Meyer calls out some problems, overall he&#39;s very positive about Agile and recommends it as a good (but imperfect) methodology.\n  Shower: Researchers looked at three formally verified systems, and found critical correctness bugs in all three. The bugs were from &#34;a wide range of mismatched assumptions&#34; and caused servers to crash or produce wrong data.\n Caveats: Most bugs were at the system boundaries; none were found in the implemented protocols. Formally verified systems, while not perfect, were considerably less buggy than unverified systems.\n  Shower: Researchers had programmers fix bugs in a codebase, either with all of the identifiers were abbreviated, or where all of the identifiers were full-words. They found no difference in time taken or quality of debugging.\n Caveats: Only applies to fixing bugs. Otherwise watertight. This is honestly one of the most rigorous and comprehensive papers I&#39;ve ever read.\n Notes: Includes ethnography on how programmers debug abbreviated code. Link is to the author preprint.\n  Shower: Presents five fallacies of &#34;why microservices solve problems monoliths have&#34; and shows how either monoliths don&#39;t actually have those problems or that microservices make the problem even worse.\n  Hype: Your favourite programming language has been updated. The newversion makes impressive performance improvement claims.\n Shower: Benchmarking modern programming languages under near-idealcircumstances, just for longer than before, suggests that we have not beenbenchmarking language implementations as accurately as we might wish. Manybenchmarks slow down over time. Some never stabilise. Many benchmarkingexperiments will not be repeatable due to non-determinism. Warmup time isimportant, but is usually either ignored, or reported inaccurately.\n Caveats: Only evaluates the x86_64 architecture, and for only twooperating systems (Linux and OpenBSD). Experiment conducted in 2017 (prior tomeltdown patching). Evaluates mainly JITted language implementations(although C benchmarks were included).\n Notes: The experiment and the benchmark runner are published under anopen source license.  Start here.\n  Hype: &#34;Scaling out is better than scaling up. Cloud is more scalable than bare metal.&#34;\n Shower: Expensify found that running a single bare-metal server was both faster and cheaper than using an x1e.32xlarge EC2 instance. By using one server, they could avoid sharding their data.\n Caveats: Does not cover if scaling out bare metal has the same advantages over scaling out EC2 (assuming you can affording sharding). Can&#39;t really compare how much cheaper the bare metal is, because they don&#39;t list the cost. I&#39;m guessing their servers are 100k each?
