Coming in at a $10 billion market capitalization would make SentinelOne the most valuable cybersecurity IPO to date.\n A source said that the road show has been stronger than anticipated, in part because of the strength of one of its competitors, CrowdStrike, which is publicly traded and currently sitting at a  market cap of $58 billion.\n  The other reason for the response is a slightly grimmer one: Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue for businesses of all sizes, public organizations, governments and individuals. \u201cNo one wants to see another SolarWinds, and there is no reason that there shouldn\u2019t be more than one or two strong players,\u201d a source said.\n As is the bigger trend in cybersecurity, Israel-hatched, Mountain View-based  SentinelOne\u2018s approach to combat that is artificial intelligence \u2014 and in its case specifically, a machine-learning-based solution that it sells under the brand  Singularity that focuses on endpoint security, working across the entire edge of the network to monitor and secure laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network.\n Last year, endpoint security solutions were estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as  $18.4 billion by 2024 \u2014 another reason why SentinelOne may have moved up the timetable on its IPO (last year the company\u2019s CEO Tomer Weingarten had told me he thought the company had one or two years left as a private company before considering an IPO, a timeline it clearly decided was worth speeding up).\n SentinelOne  raised $267 million on a $3.1 billion valuation led by Tiger Global as recently as last November, but it has been expanding rapidly. Growth last quarter was 116% compared to the same period a year before, and it now has more than 4,700 customers and annual recurring revenue of $161 million, according to its  S-1 filing. It is also still not profitable, posting a net loss of $64 million in the last quarter.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

to grow our understanding of the company beyond  our EC-1.\n First, we\u2019ll explore the growth of Duolingo\u2019s total user base, how much money it makes per active user, and how effectively the company has managed to convert free users to paid products over time. The numbers will set us up to understand what else can be learned about Duolingo\u2019s business beyond our original deep dive into the company\u2019s finances \u2014 specifically underscoring the pressure cooker it finds itself in when looking for new revenue sources.\n Starting with  Duolingo\u2019s growth in total active users, guess how fast they rose from 2019 to 2020. Hold that number in your head.\n The actual numbers are as follows: In 2019, Duolingo closed the year with 27.3 million monthly active users (MAUs); it wrapped 2020 with 36.7 million MAUs. That\u2019s a gain of 34%. If we narrow our gaze to Q1 2021 numbers compared to Q1 2020, we can see that Duolingo\u2019s MAUs rose from 33.5 million to 39.9 million, or growth of around 19%.\n  The bulk of Duolingo\u2019s growth, then, came in early 2020 when we consider its pandemic bump. Put more simply, the company scaled from 27.3 million MAUs at the end of 2019 to 33.5 million MAUs at the end of Q1 2020; from then, the company added 3.2 million more MAUs throughout 2020 and 6.4 million during the next four quarters.\n Another lens through which to view the numbers is simply a recognition that first-quarter results at Duolingo appear to be stronger than results in the rest of the year, perhaps due to New Year\u2019s resolutions to learn a new language or brush up on a second language learned in high school.\n Next, let\u2019s examine  Duolingo\u2019s monetization efforts regarding converting free users to paying users.\n Here we can see a very different growth story. While the company\u2019s MAUs rose 34% from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s paying users rose from 900,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million at the end of 2020. That is a far-sharper gain of 84% on a year-over-year basis.\n So, while Duolingo did see material user growth during 2020, it saw turbo-charged expansion in the users it was able to shake revenue from. Improved monetization, more than acceleration in user growth, was the pandemic\u2019s effect on Duolingo.\n What can we see in the company\u2019s more recent results? From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Duolingo\u2019s paid subscribers rose from 1.1 million to 1.8 million, a gain of around 64%. That was a slower pace than the company managed more generally in 2020, which matches Duolingo\u2019s slower revenue growth in Q1 2021 than it recorded in 2020.\n The number is still strong, we think. But not as impressive as the more than 100% revenue expansion that the company put on the board last year.\n In percentage terms, 3.3% of Duolingo\u2019s MAUs were paid subscribers in 2019. That figure rose to 4.4% in 2020. And in Q1 2021, it reached 4.5%. Duolingo rounds that number to 5% in its S-1, which feels somewhat aggressive to us, given the somewhat modest pace at which the metric is improving. Here\u2019s the wording:\n As of March 31, 2021, approximately 5% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Duolingo Plus. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to our revenue more than doubling every year since.\n  Next, let\u2019s chat about  revenue per MAU. To get consistent numbers, we\u2019ll divide quarterly revenues by MAU figures from the same period. So, we\u2019ll compare Q4 2019 revenue at Duolingo with its year-end MAU figure. We\u2019ll do the same for 2020, and for Q1 2021 we\u2019ll use both numbers from that period.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u589e\u957f,depicts,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u7684S-1\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u609a\u7136\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u8ba4\u8bc1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDuolingo\u2019s S-1 depicts heady growth, monetization, new focus on English certification\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u589e\u957f", "depicts", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068686, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f9d\u9760\u60a8\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6bcf\u67083\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684Phoronix\u4fdd\u8d39\uff1f\u4eca\u5929\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b83\u6765\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u867d\u7136\u6536\u76ca\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u591a\u7684Linux\u786c\u4ef6\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002 Linus Torvalds\u521a\u521a\u5c06Linux 5.13\u5185\u6838\u53d1\u5e03\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u53ea\u662f\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u3002\u5185\u6838\u5728\u65b0\u7684\uff06\uff0334\u4e0b\u8fd0\u9001;\u6e38\u884c\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd;\u4e0a\u5468\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4ee3\u53f7\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u4e3aApple M1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u672c\u652f\u6301\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u71a8\u70eb\u524d\u65b9\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u65b0\u7684Linux 5.13\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982Landlock LSM\uff0cClang CFI\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u5730\u968f\u610f\u5730\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5806\u6808\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u3002\u8fd8\u6709AMD\u6709\u8da3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u56f4\u7ed5FreeSync HDMI\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u521d\u59cbAldebaran\u4fc3\u9500\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5728Alder Lake\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5e26\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 Linux 5.13\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5IO_\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u7528USB\u663e\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\u542f\u7528\u3002\r   \u8bf7\u53c2\u9605Linux 5.13\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Linux 5.13\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u9876\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u3002\r     \u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u4e0eLinux 5.14\u5468\u671f\u548c\uff0339; s\uff06\uff0339;\u5728Linux 5.14\u4e0a\u671f\u5f85\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aLinus Torvalds\u73b0\u5df2\u53d1\u5e035.13\u516c\u544a\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u81eaRC7\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5f88\u5e73\u9759\u7684\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u5ef6\u8fdf5.13\u3002\u672c\u5468\u7684\u77ed\u8def\u662f\u5c0f\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u670988\u4e2a\u975e\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u548c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ea\u662f\u6062\u590d\uff09......\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0a\u5468\u5c0f\u800c\u4e14\u5e73\u9759\uff0c\u603b\u4f535.13\r\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b83\u548c\uff0339;\uff06\uff0339;\u8f83\u5927\u76845.x\u7248\u672c\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc716k\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u5e76\u8d85\u8fc717k\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u8d85\u8fc72k\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; s\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u5168\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u7279\u522b\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "We Rely On Your Support: Did you know that you can get  Phoronix Premium for under $3 per month?

The kernel is shipping under the new &#34;Opossums on Parade&#34; codename that was put in place last week.\r   Linux 5.13 brings initial but still early support for the Apple M1 with basic support but not yet accelerated graphics and a lot more to iron out moving ahead. There are also new Linux 5.13 security features like the Landlock LSM, Clang CFI support, and optionally randomizing the kernel stack offset at each system call. There is also AMD fun this cycle around FreeSync HDMI support, initial Aldebaran bring-up, and more. Intel has more work on Alder Lake, a new cooling driver, and more discrete graphics bring-up. There are also other changes for Linux 5.13 around faster IO_uring, a generic USB display driver, and other new hardware enablement.\r   See  the top features of Linux 5.13 or the complete  Linux 5.13 feature overview.\r     Now it&#39;s onward to the Linux 5.14 cycle and already  many features to look forward to with Linux 5.14.   Update: Linus Torvalds has now posted his 5.13  announcement, &#34; So we had quite the calm week since rc7, and I see no reason to delay 5.13. The shortlog for the week is tiny, with just 88 non-merge commits (and a few of those are just reverts)...Of course, if the last week was small and calm, 5.13 overall is\ractually fairly large. In fact, it&#39;s one of the bigger 5.x releases, with over 16k commits (over 17k if you count merges), from over 2k developers. But it&#39;s a &#34;big all over&#34; kind of thing, not something particular that stands out as particularly unusual.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,\u53d1\u5e03,apple,released,\u652f\u6301", "title": "Linux 5.13 kernel\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5305\u62ecApple M1\u652f\u6301\uff0cClang CFI\u548cLineux\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757 ", "title_en": "Linux 5.13 Kernel Released, Includes Apple M1 Support, Clang CFI, and Landlock's Linux Security Module", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.13-Released", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "\u53d1\u5e03", "apple", "released", "\u652f\u6301"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7e2dd72d1344aaf19b9a913a9227a5c5.jpg", "infoid": 1068685, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u666e\u7f57\u7ef4\u767b\u65af\uff08AP\uff09 - \u5f53\u7f8e\u56fd\u6267\u6cd5\u5b98\u5458\u9700\u8981\u7f29\u5c0f\u51c0\u8d44\u6599\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u8f6c\u5411\u5927\u578b\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u6c60\u5858\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u7ecf\u6302\u94a9\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4eba\u3002\n \u7531\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7f16\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6267\u6cd5\u8bf7\u6c42 - \u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u8d2d\u7269\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8def\u7ebf\u548c\u66f4\u591a - \u81ea2015\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u8b66\u65b9\u4e5f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7cbe\u660e\u5173\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u66f2\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u514d\u8b66\u60d5\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\n \u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u63ed\u793a\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u662f\uff0c\u7279\u6717\u666e\u65f6\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u8981\u6c42\u6765\u81ea\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u56fd\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u8bb0\u8005\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d - \u7136\u540e\u8ffd\u6c42\u7981\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u547d\u4ee4\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\n   \u57282020\u5e74\u7684\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74 - \u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6570\u636e -  Apple\uff0cGoogle\uff0cFacebook\u548cMicrosoft\u4e00\u8d77\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5f53\u5730\uff0c\u5dde\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b98\u5458\u7684112,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u5728\u5176\u4e2d85\uff05\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4ea4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u3002 Facebook\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176Instagram\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5360\u62ab\u9732\u6700\u591a\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u3002\n  \u8003\u8651\u7ebd\u6ce2\u7279\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e0224,000\u4e2a\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u590f\u5b63\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\u5c11\u4e8e100\u540d\u519b\u5b98\u5de1\u903b\u57ce\u5e02 - \u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u3002\n \u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "PROVIDENCE\u00a0(AP) \u2014 When U.S. law enforcement officials need to cast a wide net for information, they&#39;re increasingly turning to the vast digital ponds of personal data created by Big Tech companies via the devices and online services that have hooked billions of people around the world.\n Data compiled by four of the biggest tech companies shows that law enforcement requests for user information \u2014 phone calls, emails, texts, photos, shopping histories, driving routes and more \u2014 have more than tripled in the U.S. since 2015. Police are also increasingly savvy about covering their tracks so as not to alert suspects of their interest.\n That&#39;s the backdrop for recent revelations that the Trump-era U.S. Justice Department sought data from Apple, Microsoft and Google about members of Congress, their aides and news reporters in leak investigations \u2014 then pursued court orders that blocked those companies from informing their targets.\n   In just the first half of 2020 \u2014 the most recent data available \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft together fielded more than 112,000 data requests from local, state and federal officials. The companies agreed to hand over some data in 85% of those cases. Facebook, including its Instagram service, accounted for the largest number of disclosures.\n  Consider Newport,\u00a0a coastal city of 24,000 residents that attracts a flood of summer tourists. Fewer than 100 officers patrol the city \u2014 but they make multiple requests a week for online data from tech companies.\n That&#39;s because most crimes \u2014 from larceny and financial scams to a recent fatal house party stabbing at a vacation rental booked online \u2014 can be at least partly traced on the internet. Tech providers, especially social media platforms, offer a &#34;treasure trove of information&#34; that can help solve them, said Lt. Robert Salter, a supervising police detective in Newport.\n  &#34;Everything happens on Facebook,&#34; Salter said. &#34;The amount of information you can get from people&#39;s conversations online \u2014 it&#39;s insane.&#34;\n As ordinary people have become increasingly dependent on Big Tech services to help manage their lives, American law enforcement officials have grown far more savvy about technology than they were five or six years ago, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n  That&#39;s created what Cohn calls &#34;the golden age of government surveillance.&#34; Not only has it become far easier for police to trace the online trails left by suspects, they can also frequently hide their requests by obtaining gag orders from judges and magistrates. Those orders block Big Tech companies from notifying the target of a subpoena or warrant of law enforcement&#39;s interest in their information \u2014 contrary to the companies&#39; stated policies.\n Of course, there&#39;s often a reason for such secrecy, said Andrew Pak, a former federal prosecutor. It helps prevent investigations getting sidetracked because someone learns about it, he said \u2014&#34;the target, perhaps, or someone close to it.&#34;\n Longstanding opposition to such gag orders has recently resurfaced in the wake of the Trump-era orders. Apple in 2018 shared phone and account data generated by two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, but the politicians didn&#39;t find out until May, once a series of gag orders expired.\n Microsoft also shared data about a congressional aide and had to wait more than two years before telling that person. Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, last week called for an end to the overuse of secret gag orders, arguing in a Washington Post opinion piece that &#34;prosecutors too often are exploiting technology to abuse our fundamental freedoms.&#34;\n  Critics like Cohn have called for revision of U.S. surveillance laws drawn up years ago when the police and prosecutors typically had to deliver warrants to the home of the person being targeted for searches. Now that most personal information is kept in the equivalent of vast digital storehouses controlled by Big Tech companies, such searches can proceed in secret.\n &#34;Our surveillance laws are really based on the idea that if something is really important, we store it at home, and that doesn&#39;t pass the giggle test these days,&#34; Cohn said. &#34;It&#39;s just not true.&#34;\n  Many tech companies are quick to point out that the majority of the information they are forced to share is considered &#34;non-content&#34; data. But that can include useful details such as the basic personal details you supply when you register for an account, or the metadata that shows if and when you called or messaged someone, though not what you said to them.\n Law enforcement can also ask tech companies to preserve any data generated by a particular user, which prevents the target from deleting it. Doing so doesn&#39;t require a search warrant or any judicial oversight, said Armin Tadayon, a cybersecurity associate at advisory firm the Brunswick Group.\n If police later find reasonable grounds for conducting a search, they can return with a warrant and seize the preserved data. If not, the provider deletes the copies and &#34;the user likely never finds out,&#34; Tadayon said.\n  In Newport, getting a search warrant for richer online data isn&#39;t that difficult. Salter said it requires a quick trip to a nearby courthouse to seek a judge&#39;s approval; some judges are also available after hours for emergency requests. And if a judge finds there is probable cause to search through online data, tech companies almost always comply.\n &#34;Most of the companies do play ball,&#34; Salter said. &#34;We can speak with people, get questions answered. They&#39;re usually pretty helpful.&#34;\n Nearly all big tech companies \u2014 from Amazon to rental sites like Airbnb, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and service providers like Verizon \u2014 now have teams to respond to such requests and regularly publish reports about how much they disclosed. Many say they work to narrow overly broad requests and reject those that aren&#39;t legally valid.\n  Some of the most dramatic increases in requests have been to tech companies that cater to younger people. As the messaging app Snapchat has grown in popularity, so have government requests for its data. Snap, the company behind the app, fielded nearly 17,000 data requests in the first six months of 2020, compared to 762 in the same period of 2015.\n Salter said the fact that we&#39;re all doing so much online means police detectives need to stay tech-savvy. But training courses for how to file such requests aren&#39;t hard to find.\n For those worried about the growing volume of online data sought by law enforcement, Salter said: &#34;Don&#39;t commit crimes and don&#39;t use your computer and phones to do it.&#34;\n &#34;Judges are not going to sign off on something if we don&#39;t have probable cause to go forward,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re not going to look at people&#39;s information without having something to go on.&#34;\n But Cohn said more tech companies should be using encryption technology to make all personal information, including metadata, virtually impossible to decipher without a user key to unlock it.\n Until then, she said, police can short circuit constitutional protections against unreasonable searches &#34;by just going to the company instead of coming directly to us.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3,requests", "title": "\u201c\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\u201d\uff0c\u8b66\u65b9\u57286\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u63d0\u51fa112,000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8981\u6c42 ", "title_en": "'Golden Age of Surveillance', as Police Make 112,000 Data Requests in 6 Months", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newportri.com/story/news/local/2021/06/27/newport-police-use-big-tech-social-media-aid-investigations/5334035001/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3", "requests"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ba188861a0e659785786f8568f21e7d7.jpg", "infoid": 1068684, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa\u201c\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u201d\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\n \u4ed6\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u8bba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5176\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u5e01\u3002\n    Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u4eca\u5929\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u8ba1\u5212\u5217\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5141\u8bb8\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u63d0\u9192Coinbase\u5982\u4f55\u5217\u51fa\u8d44\u4ea7\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa*\u6bcf\u4e2a*\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u53d1\u4e86\u63a8\u6587\u3002\n \u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u6717\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u5e01\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6b8a\u5f85\u9047\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0a\u5e02\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u5916\uff08\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168/\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5c31\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u610f\u89c1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u81ea\u7531\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5bc6\u7801\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

It has already added a few of them, including ankr (ANKR), curve (CRV) and skale (SKL). Just three days ago, the exchange added more tokens including barnbridge (BOND), livepeer (LPT) and quant (QNT) to its roster.\n But with thousands more assets out there, it still has a long way to go if it truly wants to list every cryptocurrency.\n   \u00a9 2021 The Block Crypto, Inc.
