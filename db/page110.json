the national expansion of its virtual behavioral health solution designed specifically to support children, teenagers, and their families.\n   GV (formerly Google Ventures) led\u00a0Brightline\u2019s series B round, with participation from new investors Optum Ventures, 7wireVentures, and Gaingels, the leading venture investment syndicate in support of diversity and representing the LGBTQ community and allies. Debra Lee, chairman and CEO Emeritus, BET Networks, also contributed to the round as an independent investor.\n  Returning investors in the round include Oak HC/FT, Threshold Ventures, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, SemperVirens VC\u00a0and City Light Capital.\n The round includes $7 million of venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. Brightline has now raised a total of nearly $100 million in funding to date.\n Brightline, formerly Emilio Healthcare, developed a technology-enabled behavioral health home for children and their families. The company&#39;s growth\u00a0comes at a time when rates of behavioral health conditions are skyrocketing across the country and having a disproportionate impact on working families\u2014leading to rampant productivity loss and employees leaving the paid workforce in droves, according to Brightline.\n  Around 10 million American mothers living with their school-age children were not working at the start of 2021, a 1.4 million increase over the previous year, according to data from the Census Bureau.\n Brightline\u2019s own survey of working parents and caregivers found that 50% reported losing significant productivity at work in caring for their children\u2019s behavioral health needs.\n There is a need for family-oriented solutions to deliver behavioral health care services, according to Brightline executives.\n \u201cIn the past year, families everywhere have felt the impact of the pandemic on their children and daily lives. We\u2019re seeing more children, adolescents, and teens than ever with behavioral health challenges\u2014now is the time for us to get ahead of the coming wave of need,\u201d said Naomi Allen, Brightline CEO and co-founder in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are fortunate to have incredible partners in GV and all of our investors who joined us to make a difference in the lives of children and families. The latest funding will allow us to innovate even more quickly, expand rapidly, and help more children and families get the care they deserve.\u201d\n Brightline will use the cash infusion to scale its virtual\u00a0care across the country\u2014fueling the company&#39;s\u00a0growth as it\u00a0partner with leading national employers and major health plans to bring behavioral health support to families, according to the company.\n \u201cCDC data shows that an estimated 1 in 5 U.S. children has a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition\u2014yet 80% will not get the care they need. Pediatric behavioral health care is often less accessible and comprehensive than care for adults,\u201d said Ben Robbins, psychiatrist and venture partner at GV who is joining Brightline\u2019s board of directors. \u201cBrightline addresses the huge unmet need of pediatric behavioral health services and is uniquely positioned to provide multiple levels of care based on the needs of patients and families.\u201d\n Livongo founder Glen Tullman, now CEO of Transcarent and managing partner at 7wireVentures, and Laura Veroneau, partner at Optum Ventures, are joining Brightline as board observers.\n Brightline also announced that they are embarking on their biggest expansion to date, introducing new products with nationwide availability and expanding clinical services to new states.\n Launched in 2019, Brightline&#39;s platform offers multidisciplinary care teams, a family-focused approach and\u00a0evidence-based care delivery, and innovative technology, Brightline is able to support families with whatever challenges they&#39;re facing.\n Telehealth helps to make mental health care easier to access for kids by doing away with some of the logistical burdens\u00a0of getting to and from frequent appointments.\n  There are a few pediatric startups making inroads in the digital health market. Hazel Health operates virtual care clinics inside the school nurse&#39;s\u00a0office\u00a0to connect\u00a0students to a physician via telehealth and recently landed a $33 million funding round.\u00a0Sprout, a tech-enabled autism care and treatment program, launched in July\u00a0on the back of $10 million in seed funding.\n Daybreak Health is another startup\u00a0trying to tackle the gaps in mental health care for kids. The company launched in February 2020 and specializes in providing online counseling services, especially for teens.\n Brighline has launched new products with nationwide availability and is expanding\u00a0clinical services to new states. The company&#39;s Connect feature, which\u00a0provides families access to personalized content and tips, interactive exercises\u00a0and the ability to chat with a coach for support, will be available nationwide this summer.\n The Brightline Coaching feature also expands nationwide this summer, which provides\u00a0families with support from\u00a0behavioral health coaches to\u00a0help with issues like stress, anxiety, organizational skills, tantrums, disruptive behavior and\u00a0social-emotional learning.\n Brightline\u00a0Care will be available nationwide by the end of 2021 to support national employers and health plans, the company said.\u00a0Brightline\u2019s clinical services\u2014including behavior therapy, medication support, and speech therapy\u2014are now available in California and Massachusetts, with Washington launching in July and several more states coming soon. Brightline expects to expand these services to all 50 states by the end of this year.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:59:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u603b\u91cf,led,brightline", "title": "\u4e3a\u513f\u7ae5\u548c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u63d0\u4f9b\u865a\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u5065\u5eb7\u7597\u6cd5\u7684Brightline\u57f9\u517b\u4e86GV\u76847200\u4e07\u7cfb\u5217B\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u603b\u91cf\u5347\u81f3\u301c100\u7c73 ", "title_en": "Brightline, which provides virtual behavioral health therapy for children and teenagers, raises $72M Series B led by GV, bringing its total raised to ~$100M", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/gv-backs-brightline-s-72m-boost-expand-pediatric-behavioral-health-services", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u603b\u91cf", "led"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066995, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2akerfuffle\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u521b\u9020\u8005\u8981\u6c42\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5305\u88f9\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5154\u5b50\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6743\u529b -

What does it mean when the creator of a software package uses their social power - but not their legal power - to try and influence user behavior? Are they violating the spirit of open source? Or simply making requests that acknowledge open source realities?\n  The actual back-and-forth is in the  pull request discussion. The  citadel of internet debate that is Hacker News will give you a sense of the larger community response. Briefly, what happened was:\n The creator of an open source software package asked that the package not be incorporated into a larger project. The creator acknowledged that it was technically legal to incorporate the package, but asked that it not be included anyway.  As the author of the package that is being re-packaged here. I\u2019m against it being repacked into here.While licensing wise I cannot stop you, I do hope you can honor my request.Thank you for considering respecting the author\u2019s wishes.\n  When pushed by the project\u2019s maintainers, the package creator explained that they were worried that including the package in the larger project would result in many support requests from the community.  If users experiencing issues with [the package], they will knock on my door. And I\u2019m not willing to support that or accept that burden.\n  Downstream maintainers pushed for more information or explanation. The creator continued to express disinterest in having the package included and in a conversation about the decision\n  Eventually the creator threatened to relicense the package in a way that would make it legally incompatible with the project\n Online opinion is split on this situation. However, some substantial part of the community has responded with a  version of:\n  What can be learned from this? Is this kind of request really against the spirit of FOSS?\n  It is notable that the creator did not kick off this discussion with the threat of legal action. Instead, the creator simply requested that the package not be included. They then explicitly acknowledged that they did not have the legal power to prevent it.\n This was a request that no one had a legal obligation to respect. And yet, the creator made it because (presumably) they believed that the package maintainers lived in a world that was governed by more than black letter legal rules.\n This strikes me as a totally healthy response on behalf of the creator. They clearly understood the consequences of releasing software under an open source license and the potential consequences of being included in a popular software package. The creator expressed these concerns by way of a social request instead of a legal threat because part of living in society is being able to resolve disputes without going to court.\n We will never know, but it strikes me as entirely plausible that the creator may have been willing to leave it at that - as a request that may or may not be complied with - until the maintainers decided to follow up.\n To be clear, the maintainers\u2019 initial response also strikes me as a reasonable one. They probably wanted to understand the concerns that would motivate someone to make the request. They may have also hoped to be able to address those concerns and/or talk the creator out of the objection.\n Unfortunately, this very human response by the maintainers also happened to push the creator to do exactly what the creator was hoping to avoid by raising the concern - spend time talking to people that they do not know about their package. Eventually, after the discussion continued, the creator decided to threaten to relicense the package in a way that would legally prevent inclusion.\n It is important to recognize that this discussion ran on parallel tracks. One track was based on legal requests (or the lack of legal requests). The other was based on social/cultural requests.\n That social/cultural track has the potential to be just as powerful as the legal one (in fact, it is the basis for  this idea). Its existence illustrates that the reasonable resolution of the dispute did not have to rely on a strict interpretation of legal rights. Society is more than the law! The maintainers could have ignored the request and faced meaningful social/cultural consequences without any sort of legal enforcement. Social norms are real and create real change in the world. Even in open source.\n  On the flip side, the package in question is licensed under an MIT license. That license includes a pretty clear \u201canything that breaks is not my problem\u201d disclaimer (in all caps):\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n If the legal rules were all that mattered here, the text of the license makes this entire dispute a non-issue. The creator offers the software as-is and disclaims any responsibility for it. Why would anyone come back to them if the software had a bug?\n Of course, the text of the license does not match social expectations. Licensing terms aside, the creator recognizes that there is a social expectation in the open source software community that creators maintain packages - or, at a minimum, that it is acceptable for users to reach out to creators to ask for support and/or flag bugs.\n While the creator seems to have understood that they have no legal obligation to deal with these requests, they also understood that they might have a social/cultural obligation to deal with them. Or, at a minimum, that the tools available to open source software creators make it hard to ignore a flood of requests. No amount of pedantic textual analysis of the license terms changes that.\n  This fits in with a long list of stories about how small pieces of code are used by millions without any sort of support for maintainers of the code. In some ways, this is a success story - a random person can create something that is used by millions! In other ways, it is a tragedy - a random person can create something that will make millions of people angry if it breaks!\n Regardless of how you see this dynamic, it is pretty clear that it can create disincentives for individuals (and small groups) to strive for success in open source software. While companies like  Tidelift are working to help solve this problem, being aware of the problem - and wary of how the problem might impact you - is far from failing to understand the spirit of open source software. In fact, it may be an incredibly clear-eyed understanding of how the spirit of open source software interacts with the reality of open source software. Furthermore, framing concerns about that dynamic as a social objection instead of a legal objection seems deeply within the spirit of open source software.\n As a related community, this type of creator burden is something that the open source hardware community should be aware of and work to address. At the same time, I am not convinced that it is exactly the same type of problem in hardware as it is in software. To the extent that open source hardware includes open source software the problems are essentially identical. However, it is different when applied to the hardware itself.\n That difference rests in the fact that design and distribution of software is collapsed into a single step - just post it to the repo. In hardware those steps are quite distinct. Designing open source hardware is quite separate from distributing actual pieces of hardware. That may make it harder for a single person to be responsible for maintaining a piece that is incorporated into millions of projects without any sort of support. But that\u2019s another blog post for another day. Even if the dynamic is not identical, it is certainly similar enough to think about and try to avoid in open hardware.\n  This post originally appeared on the OSHWA blogToday we are excited to announce that the open hardware journal HardwareX is integrating O...\u2026  Continue reading", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:58:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u6e90,\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1,govern,\u521b\u9020\u8005", "title": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53d7\u884c\u4e3a ", "title_en": "Licenses Alone Do Not Govern Behavior in Open Source", "transed": 1, "url": "https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2021/06/17/licenses-and-social-norms/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u6e90", "\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1", "govern", "\u521b\u9020\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fc3c31c58253862ab75e5fa9215631c1.jpg", "infoid": 1066994, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u8df3\u8f6c\u4ee5\u641c\u7d22\u80a1\u7968\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f5c\u5bb6EdwinLef\u00e8vre\u76841923\u5e74\u7f57\u9a6c\u00e0\u8c31\u53f7\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e2d\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5609\u5408\u6770\u897f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u7075\u611f\u5230\u90a3\u4e00\u70b9\u3002 [1]\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4ecd\u5728\u6253\u5370\u4e2d\uff08ISBN 0471770884\uff09\u3002 2009\u5e7412\u6708\uff0cWiley\u5728Holdcover\u4e2d\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\u7248\uff0cISBN 0-470-48159-5\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86Lef\u00e8vre\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u56fe\u4e66\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u548c\u5730\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406Paul Tudor Jones\u7684\u524d\u8a00\u3002 [2]\n    1890-1910\uff1a\u5229\u6c83\u7f57\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u80a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u6760\u6746\u961f\u5728\u94f2\u6597\u5546\u5e97\u6760\u6746\u7387\u4e3a100\u81f31\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u6765\u6613\u4e8e\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002\n 1910-1920\uff1aLivermore\u662f\u7ebd\u7ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5546\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\u5730\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7528\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6760\u6746\u3002\n 20\u4e16\u7eaa20\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a\u5229\u5f17\u96f7\u4ece\u4e8b\u5e02\u573a\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u6536\u8d39\u768425\uff05\u7684\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u57281934\u5e74\u521b\u5efa\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\n  \u57282008\u5e74\u7684\u4e66\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a9a\u52a8\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u827e\u4f26\u683c\u6797\u65af\u6f58\u53eb\u4e66\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4e2a\u6295\u8d44\u667a\u6167\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7684\u62a5\u4ef7\u5982\uff06\uff0334;\u516c\u725b\u548c\u718a\u8d5a\u94b1;\u732a\u88ab\u5c60\u6740\uff06\uff0334;\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u8c1a\u8bed\u3002 [3]\n 2005\u5e743\u6708\u7684\u8d22\u5bcc\u6587\u7ae0\u5728\uff06\uff0334\u4e2d\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u5b83;\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u548c\uff0334;\u5173\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002 [4] \n\u5728Jack D.

It is told in the first person by a character inspired by the life of  stock trader  Jesse Livermore up to that point.  [1]\n The book remains in print (  ISBN\u00a0 0471770884). In December 2009,  Wiley published an annotated edition in  hardcover,   ISBN\u00a0 0-470-48159-5, that bridges the gap between Lef\u00e8vre&#39;s fictionalized account and the actual people and places referred to in the book. It also includes a foreword by  hedge fund manager  Paul Tudor Jones.  [2]\n    1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the  bid\u2013ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at  bucket shops.\n 1910-1920: Livermore was a  stock trader on the  New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.\n 1920s: Livermore engaged in  market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.

At the time,\u00a0KAERI\u00a0initially confirmed and then denied that the attack occurred.\n In a  statement and press conference held yesterday by\u00a0KAERI, the institute has officially confirmed the attack and apologized for attempting to cover up the incident.\n  KAERI states the attack\u00a0took place on June 14th after North Korean threat actors breached their internal network using a VPN vulnerability.\n KAERI\u00a0states that they have updated the undisclosed VPN device to fix the vulnerability. However,\u00a0access logs show that thirteen different unauthorized IP addresses gained access to the internal network through the VPN.\n One of these IP addresses is linked to a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known as &#39;Kimsuky&#39; that is believed to work under the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau intelligence agency.\n  In October 2020, CISA issued an  alert on the\u00a0Kimsuky\u00a0APT group and stated\u00a0that they are &#34;likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.&#34;\n More recently, Malwarebytes has issued a report on how Kimsuky\u00a0(aka Thallium, Black Banshee, and Velvet Chollima) has been actively targeting the South Korean government using the &#39;AppleSeed&#39; backdoor in phishing attacks.\n &#34;One of the lures used by Kimsuky named \u201c\uc678\uad50\ubd80 \uac00\ud310 2021-05-07\u201d in Korean language translates to \u201cMinistry of Foreign Affairs Edition 2021-05-07\u201d which indicates that it has been designed to target the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea,&#34; explains  Malwarebytes&#39; report on the threat actor&#39;s recent activities.\n &#34;According to our collected data, we have identified that it is one entity of high interest for Kimsuky.&#34;\n Malwarebytes states that Kimsuky\u00a0has targeted other South Korean government agencies in recent phishing attacks, including:\n  KAERI\u00a0states that they are still investigating the attack to confirm what information has been accessed.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:22:16", "source_domain":

And the company said it now reaches more than 30 million families worldwide with its mobile apps.\n The company targets its \u201cplaylearning\u201d app at children 2-8 as it tries to expand their vocabulary, improve their literacy skills, and develop important 21st-century skills in a fun, safe environment.\n  Lingokids also invites families to take part in their kids\u2019 playlearning journey through exciting play-together activities. All told, the company\u2019s apps have more than 600 learning activities and songs. The games teach an array of topics and everyday language, as well as 21st-century skills like creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking.\n The apps feature fun, unique characters, developed by Guillermo Garc\u00eda-Cars\u00ed (creator of the famous cartoon  Pocoy\u00f3) and his team. Featuring both original and Oxford University Press content, the Lingokids curriculum has been specially crafted by the company\u2019s educational board with experts in early language learning from companies like LeapFrog, Hasbro, Disney, and Nickelodeon.\n Lingokids has received accolades from programs like PTPA, Mom\u2019s Choice Awards, Product Hackers Awards, enlightED, and Educational App Store. Lingokids was also named one of the Top Startups in 2020 by LinkedIn. The platform is certified by the KidSafe Seal Program and offers a kid-safe environment that is ad-free.\n   Launched in 2016, the San Francisco-based Lingokids has created its \u201cplaylearning\u201d app, and most of its developers are in Madrid, Spain. Lingokids is dedicated to supporting parents in their child\u2019s learning journey, giving them a parents portal featuring each child\u2019s progress with weekly reports, curriculum overviews, activity timeline, as well as advice and tips for parents\u2019 everyday lives through its Parents Community.\n \u201cI was just coming out from an exit, and my sister asked me to help my niece learn English,\u201d Viedma said. \u201cI was something of a gamer with a computer science background. I had always wanted to do games at some point in my life. So I started building some games for my 2-year-old niece.\u201d\n Viedma wanted to get away from passive video experiences. His games worked, and the business snowballed. He formed a company and started making games that he thought were fun. They had real gameplay elements, and then added ecuational elements. They now range from puzzles to endless runner games. The biggest market today is the U.S., where 60% of the families are based. Mexico and Brazil are also large markets.\n The third institutional funding round was led by an undisclosed investor, with participation from GP Bullhound and existing investors HV Capital and Ravensburger, among others. The funding will be used for further international expansion, development of new and engaging forms of content for kids, as well as global hiring, especially for the platform engineering and development teams. Lingokids has raised $65 million to date, reaching positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020.\n Crist\u00f3bal Viedma, the CEO and founder of Lingokids, said in an interview with GamesBeat that its goal is to help parents and caretakers raise their kids and break down educational barriers. He said the company provides quality education options that parents can trust and these are more important than ever.\n During the pandemic, more than  65% of households with children reported the use of online learning, and 68% of parents said they now rely on early learning apps to supplement their children\u2019s education, according to the U.S. Census. As a trusted resource for educational and interactive content, Lingokids tripled its number of users since the beginning of the pandemic, and is poised to transform the early education market.\n   With this new funding, Lingokids will rapidly increase its international growth. In addition, it will expand its offerings related to science technology engineering and math (STEM), and the learning of skills that many kids missed out on during the past school year like emotional intelligence, empathy, and critical thinking. Lingokids will also develop new audio content in audiobooks and audio-exercises, focusing on topics related to mental health, mindfulness, and meditation.\n \u201cWe\u2019re doing early childhood education for kids ages two to eight years old, teaching them all the basics like language, literacy, reading, writing, mathematics, logic, and programming,\u201d Viedma said. \u201cA billion kids are accessing digital content. But while there are lots of companies in the industry, we are different.\u201d\n The company targets families, with the customer being the parent rather than schools. It creates original content that creates playful interactive experiences for kids. And it reaches those kids through mobile apps.\n \u201cWe are a trusted brand that people learn about when they are looking for kids-safe learning,\u201d Viedma said.\n Lingokids plans to hire an additional 60 people around the world this year, adding to its team of close to 100. The latest additions to Lingokids include Vladimir Klimov as director of content strategy and Tiago Pregueiro, former product director at Cabify, as vice president of product.\n   With its previous investment last year, Lingokids also joined forces with the international toy and puzzles company, Ravensburger. Lingokids and Ravensburger will develop merchandising and new games and toys offline to complement Lingokids\u2019 online activities.\n The company\u2019s partners include Save the Children, UNICEF, UNHCR and American Red Cross.\u00a0The company has been approached multiple times by companies that want to license brands to it or buy it, but Viedma said the company wants to invest in its own learning games and brands.\n \u201cThe long-term vision of the company is building this iconic brand for early childhood education,\u201d he said. \u201cSome experiences are multiplayer, as we think learning can be a social experience.\u201d\n GamesBeat&#39;s creed when covering the game industry is &#34;where passion meets business.&#34; What does this mean?

"Wealth-management software provider Addepar Inc. more than doubled its valuation to $2.17 billion from seven months ago in its latest funding round, the company said Tuesday.\n  Addepar said it had raised $150 million from New York hedge-fund firm D1 Capital Partners. It was previously valued at nearly $1 billion after its last funding round in November, according to a person familiar with the deal.  Earlier investors in Addepar, founded in 2009 by Palantir Technologies Inc. co-founder and serial entrepreneur Joe Lonsdale, include venture firms Valor Equity Partners and WestCap Group.\n  Turbulent markets and a desire by investment advisers to know what could happen to their clients\u2019 portfolios during the pandemic has spurred Addepar\u2019s recent growth, said Chief Executive Eric Poirier. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company makes software for investment advisers, banks and family offices that aims to simplify the tracking of how investment portfolios perform across asset classes. Addepar currently tracks about $2.7 trillion of assets and has added an average $15 billion in assets a week since mid-2020.\n  \u201cThis has been a human trust business since the beginning of time, and having a human who is the financial professional use technology to serve their clients is a sea change,\u201d said Mr. Poirier.\n      He declined to say if the company was profitable or to disclose its revenue but said Addepar was bringing on clients and assets at its fastest pace yet. The company says it thinks the total market demand for investible assets is more than $200 trillion globally. Clients include  AllianceBernstein Holding LP,  Morgan Stanley and  Stifel Financial  , whose investment arm previously invested in Addepar.\n  Mr. Lonsdale, who ran Addepar for its first three years and now is chairman of its board, described it as \u201can operating system for finance.\u201d He said he sees users turning to Addepar because the software aggregates large amounts of information needed to help them make decisions about money.\n  Mr. Lonsdale also said Addepar could have an ecosystem of applications built around its software in several years. In addition to simplified performance reporting, Addepar lets clients view net worth at a glance and last year rolled out a feature called Marketplace that provides information about investment products such as hedge funds, private-equity funds and shares in private companies.\n  Mr. Lonsdale said building out the technology of the firm had taken longer than expected.\n  \u201cIt turns out there are a lot of hard problems to solve in wealth management\u201d such as the distribution of data across thousands of custodians and fund administrators, he said.\n  Addepar plans to use the funding to scale up its sales force globally, particularly in Europe, and continue to invest in research and development. Roughly 90% of its client base is in the U.S. currently, Mr. Poirier said.\n  D1 will take a board observer role.

In a large cluster, if all servers communicate with all the other servers, a lot of network bandwidth can be consumed. Information should reach all the nodes even when some network links are experiencing issues.\n Cluster nodes use gossip style communication to propagate state updates. Each node selects a random node to pass the information it has. This is done at a regular interval, say every 1 second. Each time, a random node is selected to pass on the information.\n   The messages should not consume a lot of network bandwidth. There should be an upper bound of say a few hundred Kbs, making sure that the applications&#39; data transfer is not impacted by too many messages across the cluster.\n The metadata propagation should tolerate network and a few server failures. It should reach all the cluster nodes even if a few network links are down, or a few servers have failed.\n  Each cluster nodes stores the metadata as a list of key value pairs associated with each node in the cluster as following:\n     At startup, each cluster node adds the metadata about itself, which needs to be propagated to other nodes. An example of metadata can be the IP address and port the node listens on, the partitions it&#39;s responsible for, etc. The Gossip instance needs to know about at least one other node to start the gossip communication. The well known cluster node, which is used to initialize the Gossip instance is called as a seed node or an introducer. Any node can act as an introducer.\n  public Gossip(InetAddressAndPort listenAddress, List&lt;InetAddressAndPort&gt; seedNodes, String nodeId) throws IOException { this.listenAddress = listenAddress; //filter this node itself in case its part of the seed nodes this.seedNodes = removeSelfAddress(seedNodes); this.nodeId = new NodeId(nodeId);  addLocalState(GossipKeys.ADDRESS, listenAddress.toString()); this.socketServer = new NIOSocketListener(newGossipRequestConsumer(), listenAddress); } private void addLocalState(String key, String value) { NodeState nodeState = clusterMetadata.get(listenAddress); if (nodeState == null) { nodeState = new NodeState(); clusterMetadata.put(nodeId, nodeState); } nodeState.add(key, new VersionedValue(value, incremenetVersion())); }\n Each cluster node schedules a job to transmit the metadata it has to other nodes at regular intervals.\n  private ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor gossipExecutor = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1); private long gossipIntervalMs = 1000; private ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; taskFuture; public void start() { socketServer.start(); taskFuture = gossipExecutor.scheduleAtFixedRate(()-&gt; doGossip(), gossipIntervalMs, gossipIntervalMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS); }\n When the scheduled task is invoked, it picks up a small set of random nodes from the list of servers from the metadata map.

This is fine for a newly joined node, but once the state is up to date, it&#39;s unnecessary to send the complete state. The cluster node just needs to send the state changes since the last gossip. For achieving this, each node maintains a version number which is incremented every time a new metadata entry is added locally.\n   Each value in the cluster metadata is maintained with a version number.

The sender can then immediately respond with the requested metadata. This avoids an extra message that otherwise would have been required.\n Gossip protocol used in  [cockroachdb] maintains state for each connected node. For each connection, it maintains the last version sent to that node, and the version received from that node. This is so that it can send &#39;state since the last sent version&#39; and ask for &#39;state from the last received version&#39;.\n Some other efficient alternatives can be used as well, sending a hash of the entire Map and if the hash is the same, then doing nothing.\n Cluster nodes randomly select the node to send the Gossip message. An example implementation in Java can use java.util.Random as following:\n  private Random random = new Random(); private InetAddressAndPort pickRandomNode(List&lt;InetAddressAndPort&gt; knownClusterNodes) { int randomNodeIndex = random.nextInt(knownClusterNodes.size()); InetAddressAndPort gossipTo = knownClusterNodes.get(randomNodeIndex); return gossipTo; }\n There can be other considerations such as the node that is least contacted with. For example, Gossip protocol in  Cockroachdb selects nodes this way.\n Maintaining the list of available nodes in the cluster is one of the most common usage of Gossip protocols. There are two approaches in use.\n [swim-gossip] uses a separate probing component which continuously probes different nodes in the cluster to detect if they are available. If it detects that the node is alive or dead, that result is propagated to the entire cluster with Gossip communication. The prober randomly selects a node to send the Gossip message. If the receiving node detects that this is new information, it immediately sends the message to a randomly selected node. This way, the failure of a node or newly joined node in the cluster is quickly known to the entire cluster.\n The cluster node can periodically update its own state to reflect its heartbeat. This state is then propagated to the entire cluster through the gossip messages exchanged. Each cluster node can then check if it has received any update for a particular cluster node in a fixed amount of time or else mark that node as down. In this case, each cluster node independently determines if a node is up or down.\n The versioned values does not work well if the node crashes or restarts, as all the in-memory state is lost. More importantly, the node can have different values for the same key. For example, the cluster node can start with a different IP address and port, or can start with a different configuration.  Generation Clock can be used to mark generation with every value, so that when the metadata state is sent to a random cluster node, the receiving node can detect changes not just by the version number, but also with the generation.\n It is useful to note that this mechanism is not necessary for the core Gossip protocol to work. But it&#39;s implemented in practice to make sure that the state changes are tracked correctly.\n [cassandra] uses Gossip protocol for the group membership and failure detection of cluster nodes. Metadata for each cluster node such as the tokens assigned to each cluster node, is also transmitted using Gossip protocol.\n   Blockchain implementations such as  Hyperledger Fabric use Gossip protocol for group membership and sending ledger metadata.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:14:43", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u516b\u5366,gossip,\u8282\u70b9", "title": "\u516b\u5366\u4f20\u64ad ", "title_en": "Gossip Dissemination", "transed": 1, "url": "https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/gossip-dissemination.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u516b\u5366", "gossip", "\u8282\u70b9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "afab6ba73b70acbe35cb9d128ff6eea4.jpeg", "infoid": 1066988, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u8fd9\u662f\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u7684\u4eba\u7edd\u5bf9\u575a\u6301\uff0c\u6559\u4f1a\u56fe\u7075\u8bba\u6587\u610f\u5473\u7740Muh\u7535\u8111\u662f\u4e00\u5207\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u91cd\u590dAI\u5c06\u53d6\u4ee3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u63d0\u51fa\u7cbe\u5fc3\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0a\u9762\u5217\u51fa\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684VLSI\u65f6\u4ee3\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u90fd\u5f88\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u51fb\u8d25\u7684\u90e8\u843d;\u8058\u8bf7\u4e00\u4e2a\u201cAI\u201d\uff08\u5916\u661f\u4eba\u6216\u79fb\u6c11\uff09\u5974\u96b6\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u4ee5\u5199\u4e0bTerraform\u6216\u7535\u5b50\u524d\u7aef\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u652f\u4ed8\u5de7\u5999\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u66f4\u52a0\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5c06\u5438\u6536\u5b83\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u5212\u8fc7\u65f6\u8d2d\u4e70\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u786c\u4ef6\u884c\u4e1a\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u4e2d\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0d\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u4f60\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e;\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8425\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u597d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u8d2d\u4e70\u5927\u91cf\u9644\u52a0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c3d\u5feb\u78e8\u635f\u3002 ", "note_en": "There are a number of things that people theoretically know how to do, but which aren\u2019t possible because of how software gets made. Some of these are almost forgotten, but there are at least examples of all of them in existence.\n Automated FFI parsers. In 2021 I should be able to point any interpreted language at a C include file and have all the functions described in it turned into reasonably safe FFIed function calls, complete with autogenerated documentation. For example, if I want javascript calls to libsodium, I shouldn\u2019t have to write anything; javascript knows about C APIs. I\u2019m not asking for runtimes to talk to each other, you can keep up the insipid RPC-serialization conga dance for that. I\u2019m just asking for a technology that encapsulates C (and Fortran and \u2026. maybe C++) function calls and makes them accessible to other runtimes without actually doing any work. Of course parsers that do useful things are hard; people would rather write new serialization protocols. There will always be exceptions where such things don\u2019t work, but you should be able to do 95% of the work using metaprogramming. Crap that runs on the JVM; same story -not only could you technically parse .h files and turn them into JNI, you should be able to have all your hooks into Clojure or Scala or whatever without writing anything. Clojure at least seems well equipped to do it, but I\u2019m pretty sure this hasn\u2019t happened yet. You see pieces of  this idea  here and  there, but like everything else about modernity, they suck.\n While I\u2019m talking about FFIs to high level languages, how about a VM that recognizes that it is not a unique snowflake, and that sometimes you have to call a function which may allocate memory outside its stack or something similarly routine but insane. Most VM designs I\u2019ve seen are basically just student exercises; why not assume the outside world exists and has useful things to say? I think Racket has some good  ideas in this domain, but I\u2019m pretty sure it could be done better and there should be a higher standard.\n Cloud providers should admit they\u2019re basically mainframes and write an operating system instead of the ad-hoc collection of horse shit they foist on developers. Imagine if the EC2 were as clean as, I dunno,  z/OS, which has more or less been around since the 1960s. That would be pretty cool. I could read a single book instead of 100 books on all the myriad tools and services and frameworks offered by Oligarch Bezos. He would be hailed as a Jobs-like technical innovator if he had some of his slaves do this, and he would be remembered with gratitude, rather than as the sperdo who dumped his wife for sexorz with lip filler  Cthulhu. There\u2019s no excuse for this from an engineering perspective; Bezos was smart enough to know he was going to do timesharing, he was also smart enough to constrain the spaghetti into something resembling an OS. Same story with all the other cloud services. Really, they should all run like Heroku and you\u2019d never notice they were there. You could also draw flowcharts for most of this shit and replace devops with something that looks like labview. Nobody will do that either, as innovation in core software engineering, or even learning from the past in core software engineering is basically dead.\n Front ends could be drag and drop native GUIs instead of electron apps. There are still examples of this around, but it seems to be a dying paradigm. It\u2019s fascinating to me that people find it easier to write a pile of React and HTML on top of electron rather than dragging and dropping native widgets for a framework like we did in the old days. Literally this was possible on a 286 PC/XT running DOS; it worked great, looked great, had fewer problems. You know why it doesn\u2019t get done? Because doing it is kind of hard, and electron apps are \u201ceasy\u201d in that there are tons of cheap, fungible engineers with those skills.\u00a0 In general  native GUI frameworks are shit and they almost never include a GUI to develop them in. Even if you made something not as shitty as electron; maybe something that took 10mb instead of 500mb and didn\u2019t gobble up all memory on your system that would be amazing. This is completely possible. People used to make GUI frameworks which did  more than electron apps, looked better and fit in the tens of kilobytes range.\n Compilers and interpreters should learn how modern computers work. Pretty much all compilers and interpreters think computers are a PDP-11 stack machine. There are consequences to this everyone knows about: security is fairly execrable. There\u2019s other consequences though! For example, the fact that memory is godawful slow and there are multiple cache speeds is a very serious performance problem unless you\u2019re dealing with trivial amounts of memory. There are no compilers which can help you with this, unless you count meta-compilers on limited problems like ATLAS-BLAS or FFTW. There are a few interpreted languages whose designers have awareness of this and at least don\u2019t fight the OS over these facts, or attempt to insist they\u2019re really running on a PDP-11.\n Operating systems don\u2019t have to look like your crazy hoarder aunt\u2019s house. I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but in my lifetime there were excellent multitasking operating systems with superior GUIs, networking, development toolchains, RTOS subsystems, cryptography that made the NSA nervous, and they all fit on a  70mb tape drive, and they would support something like 20 people checking their email and compiling Fortran for general relativity calculations from emacs terms. Meanwhile, my phone needs a constant diet of gigabyte upgrades to continue functioning reliably as a fucking telephone; telephones theoretically don\u2019t even need a single transistor. Even my linux machines are ridiculously bloated and seem to require daily updates and patches. Why does shit like DPDK exist? Because your OS is stuck in the 1990s when ethernet was 10mbps. There\u2019s zero reason or excuse for this, other than modern programmers are like your crazy hoarder aunt because storage is cheap and competent coder time is expensive. Clean OS design has a lot of follow on benefits, such as rare patching, higher security and lower maintenance in general. I have 4 objects in my house who require constant OS\u00a0 upgrades (used to be 5, but my macbook committed suicide after an \u201cOS upgrade\u201d so I now use it as a paperweight), not including my TV or my car; make a cleaner OS and life actually gets better instead of everyone being a sort of shitty IT slave to keep their refrigerator and telephone running.\u00a0Instead of a nice OS, current year innovation\u00a0 is the open source \u201c code of conduct\u201d -apparently hoping you\u2019ll attract enough people mentally ill enough to work for free, but sane enough to do useful work; arguably a narrow demographic.\n The funny thing is, the same people who absolutely insist that the Church Turing thesis means muh computer is all-powerful simulator of everything, or repeat the fantasy that AI will replace everyone\u2019s jobs will come up with elaborate reasons why these things listed above are too hard to achieve in the corporeal world, despite most of them being solved problems from the VLSI era of computer engineering. The reality is they\u2019re all quite possible, but nobody makes money doing them. Engineers are a defeated tribe; it\u2019s cheaper to hire an \u201cAI\u201d (Alien or Immigrant) slave to write the terraform or electron front end rather than paying clever engineers well enough to build themselves useful tooling to make them more productive and the world a better place. Consumers will suck it up and buy more memory, along with planned obsolescence, keeping the hardware industry in business. Computers aren\u2019t for making your life easier; they\u2019re for surveillance and marketing, and for manufacturers a consumer good they hope you buy lots of add-ons and\u00a0 upgrades for, and which wears out as soon as possible.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:14:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,software,\u8d2d\u4e70", "title":

", "note_en": "OpenZFS founding developer Matthew Ahrens merged one of the most sought-after features in ZFS history\u2014RAIDz expansion\u2014into master last week. The new feature allows a ZFS user to expand the size of a single RAIDz vdev. For example, you can use the new feature to turn a three-disk RAIDz1 into a four, five, or six RAIDz1.\n  OpenZFS is a complex filesystem, and things are necessarily going to get a bit chewy explaining how the feature works. So if you&#39;re a ZFS newbie, you may want to refer back to our comprehensive ZFS 101  introduction.  In addition to being a filesystem, ZFS is a storage array and volume manager, meaning that you can feed it a whole pile of disk devices, not just one. The heart of a ZFS storage system is the zpool\u2014this is the most fundamental level of ZFS storage. The  zpool\u00a0in turn contains  vdevs, and  vdevs\u00a0contain actual disks within them. Writes are split into units called  records\u00a0or  blocks, which are then distributed semi-evenly among the  vdevs.\n A storage  vdev\u00a0can be one of five types\u2014a single disk, mirror,\u00a0 RAIDz1,  RAIDz2, or  RAIDz3. You can add more  vdevs\u00a0to a  zpool, and you can  attach\u00a0more disks to a single or mirror  vdev. But managing storage this way requires some planning ahead and budgeting\u2014which hobbyists and homelabbers frequently aren&#39;t too enthusiastic about.\n Conventional\u00a0 RAID, which does not share the &#34;pool&#34; concept with ZFS, generally offers the ability to expand and/or reshape an array in place. For example, you might add a single disk to a six-disk  RAID6\u00a0array, thereby turning it into a seven-disk  RAID6\u00a0array. Undergoing a live reshaping can be pretty painful, especially on nearly full arrays; it&#39;s entirely possible that such a task might require a week or more, with array performance limited to a quarter or less of normal the entire time.\n Historically, ZFS has eschewed this sort of expansion. ZFS was originally developed for business use, and live array re-shaping is generally a non-starter in the business world. Dropping your storage&#39;s performance to unusable levels for days on end generally costs more in payroll and overhead than buying an entirely new set of hardware would. Live expansion is also potentially very dangerous since it involves reading and re-writing all data and puts the array in a temporary and far less well-tested &#34;half this, half that&#34; condition until it completes.\n For users with many disks, the new  RAIDz\u00a0expansion is unlikely to materially change how they use ZFS. It will still be both easier and more practical to manage  vdevs\u00a0as complete units rather than trying to muck about inside them. But hobbyists, homelabbers, and small users who run ZFS with a single  vdev\u00a0will likely get a lot of use out of the new feature.\n   From a practical perspective, Ahrens&#39; new  vdev\u00a0expansion feature merely adds new capabilities to an existing command, namely,  zpool attach, which is normally used to add a disk to a single-disk  vdev\u00a0(turning it into a  mirror vdev) or add an extra disk to a  mirror\u00a0(for example, turning a two-disk  mirror\u00a0into a three-disk  mirror).\n    With the new code, you&#39;ll be able to  attach\u00a0new disks to an existing  RAIDz\u00a0vdev as well. Doing so expands the vdev in width but does not change the  vdev\u00a0type, so you can turn a six-disk  RAIDz2\u00a0vdev into a seven-disk  RAIDz2\u00a0vdev, but you\u00a0 can&#39;t turn it into a seven-disk  RAIDz3.\n Upon issuing your  zpool attach\u00a0command, the expansion begins. During expansion, each  block\u00a0or  record\u00a0is read from the  vdev\u00a0being expanded and is then rewritten. The sectors of the rewritten  block\u00a0are distributed among all disks in the  vdev, including the new disk(s), but the width of the stripe itself is not changed. So a  RAIDz2 vdev\u00a0expanded from six disks to ten will still be full of six-wide stripes after expansion completes.\n So while the user will see the extra space made available by the new disks, the storage efficiency of the expanded data will not have improved due to the new disks. In the example above, we went from a six-disk  RAIDz2\u00a0with a nominal storage efficiency of 67 percent (four of every six sectors are data) to a ten-disk  RAIDz2. Data\u00a0 newly written to the ten-disk RAIDz2 has a nominal storage efficiency of 80 percent\u2014eight of every ten sectors are data\u2014but the old expanded data is still written in six-wide stripes, so it still has the old 67 percent storage efficiency.\n It&#39;s worth noting that this isn&#39;t an unexpected or bizarre state for a vdev to be in\u2014 RAIDz\u00a0already uses a dynamic, variable stripe width to account for  blocks\u00a0or  records\u00a0too small to stripe across all the disks in a single  vdev.\n For example, if you write a single metadata block\u2014the data containing a file&#39;s name, permissions, and location on disk\u2014it fits within a single  sector\u00a0on disk. If you write that metadata block to a ten-wide  RAIDz2, you don&#39;t write a full ten-wide stripe\u2014instead, you write an undersized  block\u00a0only three disks wide; a single data  sector plus two parity  sectors. So the &#34;undersized&#34;  blocks\u00a0in a newly expanded  RAIDz\u00a0vdev aren&#39;t anything for ZFS to get confused about. They&#39;re just another day at the office.\n  As we discussed above, a newly expanded  RAIDz vdev won&#39;t look quite like one designed that way from &#34;birth&#34;\u2014at least, not at first. Although there are more disks in the mix, the internal structure of the data isn&#39;t changed.\n Adding one or more new disks to the  vdev\u00a0means that it should be capable of somewhat higher throughput. Even though the legacy  blocks\u00a0don&#39;t span the entire width of the  vdev, the added disks mean more spindles to distribute the work around. This probably won&#39;t make for a jaw-dropping speed increase, though\u2014six-wide stripes on a seven-disk  vdev\u00a0mean that you still can&#39;t read or write two  blocks\u00a0simultaneously, so any speed improvements are likely to be minor.\n The net impact to performance can be difficult to predict. If you are expanding from a six-disk  RAIDz2\u00a0to a seven-disk  RAIDz2, for example, your original six-disk configuration didn&#39;t need any padding. A 128KiB  block\u00a0can be cut evenly into four 32KiB data pieces, with two 32KiB parity pieces. The same record split among\u00a0 seven disks requires padding because 128KiB/five data pieces doesn&#39;t come out to an even number of sectors.\n    Similarly, in some cases\u2014particularly with a small  recordsize\u00a0or  volblocksize\u00a0set\u2014the workload per individual disk may be significantly less challenging in the older, narrower layout than in the newer, wider one. A 128KiB  block\u00a0split into 32KiB pieces for a six-wide  RAIDz2 can be read or written more efficiently\u00a0 per disk than one split into 16KiB pieces for a ten-wide  RAIDz2, for example\u2014so it&#39;s a bit of a crapshoot whether more disks but smaller pieces will provide more throughput than fewer disks but larger pieces did.\n The one thing you can be certain of is that the newly expanded configuration should typically perform\u00a0as well as the original non-expanded version\u2014and that once the majority of data is (re)written in the new width, the expanded  vdev\u00a0won&#39;t perform any differently, or be any less reliable, than one that was designed that way from the start.\n  It might seem odd that the initial expansion process doesn&#39;t rewrite all existing  blocks\u00a0to the new width while it&#39;s running\u2014after all, it&#39;s reading and re-writing the data anyway, right? We asked Ahrens why the original width was left as-is, and the answer boils down to &#34;it&#39;s easier and safer that way.&#34;\n One key factor to recognize is that technically, the expansion\u00a0 isn&#39;t moving  blocks; it&#39;s just moving  sectors. The way it&#39;s written, the expansion code doesn&#39;t need to know where ZFS&#39;\u00a0logical  block\u00a0boundaries are\u2014the expansion routine has no idea whether an individual  sector\u00a0is parity or data, let alone which  block\u00a0it belongs to.\n Expansion could traverse all the  block pointers to locate  block\u00a0boundaries, and\u00a0 then\u00a0it would know which  sector\u00a0belongs to what  block\u00a0and how to re-shape the  block, but according to Ahrens, doing things that way would be extremely invasive to ZFS&#39;\u00a0on-disk format. The expansion would need to continually update  spacemaps\u00a0on  metaslabs\u00a0to account for changes in the on-disk size of each  block\u2014and if the  block\u00a0is part of a  dataset\u00a0rather than a  zvol, update the per-dataset and per-file space accounting as well.\n If it really makes your teeth itch knowing you have four-wide stripes on a freshly five-wide vdev, you can just read and re-write your data yourself after expansion completes. The simplest way to do this is to use  zfs snapshot,  zfs send, and  zfs receive\u00a0to replicate entire  datasets and  zvols. If you&#39;re not worried about ZFS properties, a simple  mv\u00a0operation will do the trick.\n However, we&#39;d recommend in most cases just relaxing and letting ZFS do its thing. Your undersized  blocks\u00a0from older data aren&#39;t really hurting anything, and as you naturally delete and/or alter data over the life of the  vdev, most of them will get re-written naturally as necessary, without the need for admin intervention or long periods of high storage load due to obsessively reading and re-writing everything all at once.\n  Ahrens&#39; new code is in OpenZFS master but is not yet a part of any OpenZFS release, let alone added to anyone else&#39;s repositories. We asked Ahrens when we might expect to see the code in production, and unfortunately, it will be a while.\n RAIDz expansion hit master too late to be included in the upcoming OpenZFS 2.1 release, expected very soon (2.1 release candidate 7 is available now). It should be included in the next major OpenZFS release; it&#39;s too early for concrete dates, but major releases typically happen about once per year.\n Broadly speaking, we expect RAIDz expansion to hit production in the likes of Ubuntu and FreeBSD somewhere around August 2022, but that&#39;s just a guess. TrueNAS may very well put it into production sooner than that, since ixSystems tends to pull ZFS features from master before they officially hit release status.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:14:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7c89\u4e1d,fans,\u6269\u5c55", "title": "ZFS\u7c89\u4e1d\uff0cEnjoice  -  Raidz\u6269\u5f20\u5c06\u5f88\u5feb\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b ", "title_en": "ZFS fans, rejoice \u2013 RAIDz expansion will be a thing soon", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/raidz-expansion-code-lands-in-openzfs-master/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7c89\u4e1d", "fans", "\u6269\u5c55"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066985, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8d5e\u52a9\u7684\u9876\u90e8\u7f51\u7ad9\uff08\u6216\u201c\u8d5e\u52a9\u74f7\u7816\u201d\uff09\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u6570Firefox\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7279\u5f81\u3002 Mozilla\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728Firefox\u4e3b\u9875\uff08\u6216\u65b0\u9009\u9879\u5361\uff09\u4e0a\u4e3aFirefox\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d5e\u52a9\u7684\u74f7\u7816\u3002 \u5f53\u7528\u6237\u5355\u51fb\u8d5e\u52a9\u74f7\u7816\u65f6\uff0cMozilla\u662f\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u3002  \u9690\u79c1\u662fMozilla\uff06\uff0339;\u7279\u6d3e\u56e2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u4e0e\u7b26\u5408Firefox\u9690\u79c1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5408\u4f5c\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u662fAdmarketplace\u3002  \u70b9\u51fb\u8d5e\u52a9\u74e6\u7247\u65f6\uff0cFirefox\u901a\u8fc7Mozilla\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u53d1\u9001\u533f\u540d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6570\u636e\u3002 \u6b64\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u4f55\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u60a8\u5355\u51fb\u8d5e\u52a9\u7684\u9876\u7aef\u7ad9\u70b9\u65f6\u624d\u5171\u4eab\u3002 ", "note_en": "Sponsored Top Sites (or \u201csponsored tiles\u201d) is an experimental feature currently being tested by a small percentage of Firefox users in a limited number of markets.

They surveyed 902 people in the United States, 975 in the Netherlands, and 993 in Portugal.\n In a comment template designed to look like the common commenting platform Disqus, researchers randomly showed survey participants social media posts. Here\u2019s how they did it:\n Participants were exposed to a social media post that contained either hate speech or profanity. Then they were exposed to a post from a moderator \u2014\u00a0either a human or an algorithm \u2014\u00a0that deleted the initial post because it was offensive. This message either explained specifically why the post was deleted, gave a general sense of why it was deleted with a clickable link to community guidelines for the site, or offered no explanation. Afterward, participants answered questions about how fair or legitimate the deletion was and how transparent or trustworthy the moderator was.\n  In all countries, survey participants thought that removing hate speech was more fair and legitimate than removing profanity, and found the moderators who did so and offered a detailed explanation of why to be more transparent. In the U.S. and the Netherlands, participants found moderators removing hate speech to be more trustworthy than those who removed profanity. While the method of removal \u2014 either by a human or an algorithm \u2014 did not impact how Americans and Dutch people felt about content removal, in Portugal, \u201cparticipants perceived deletions by human moderators as more fair and legitimate compared to deletions by algorithms.\u201d\n  Moderators should focus more on hate speech, because people see hate speech as more in need of deletion than profanity.\n  Algorithmic moderators may be perceived equally to human moderators, although specific cultural contexts should be considered because this may not be the case in every country.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 12:31:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "rust,\u4ec7\u6068,speech,\u5220\u9664", "title": "\u8c03\u67e5\uff1a\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u7528\u6237\u770b\u5230\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u5220\u9664\uff0c\u6bd4\u6d88\u9664\u4eb5\u6e0e\u66f4\u5177\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u8ba8\u8bba\u4ec7\u6068\u7684\u4e3b\u6301\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u66f4\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56 ", "title_en": "Survey: social media users see the removal of hate speech as more fair than removing profanity, with moderators who removed hate speech seen as more trustworthy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/comment-moderators-should-focus-more-on-hate-speech-than-profanity-a-new-study-suggests/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u4ec7\u6068", "speech", "\u5220\u9664"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "20045e6910b397b737151b247891ced2.jpg", "infoid": 1066982, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u8d39\u57ce\u90ca\u533a\u88ad\u51fb\u4e86\u6bd2\u8d29\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u9ebb\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee4\u4ed6\u4eec\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u9c7c\u7f38\u4e0b\u65b9\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u8231\u5185\u85cf\u7684\u73b0\u91d1250\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u5899\u58c1\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u827a\u672f -  14\u5f20\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u52a0\u60ca\u8bb6\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u7684\u827a\u672f\u54c1 -  14\u5f20\u5c71\u4e0a\u5806\u653e\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u4e4b\u5bb6\uff0c\u7f57\u7eb3\u5fb7\u8d1d\u897f\u4e9a\u8bfa\u51e0\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u50a8\u7269\u5355\u5143\u3002\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u5305\u62ecRenoir\uff0cPicasso\u548cSalvadorDal\u00ed\u3002\n \u201c\u8fd9\u8df3\u4e86\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u8eab\u8fb9\uff0c\u201d\u5bb6\u4e61\u5b89\u5168\u8c03\u67e5\u8d39\u57ce\u7684\u7279\u522b\u4ee3\u7406\u4ebaBrian A.

The artists included Renoir, Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed.\n \u201cThat jumped out at us,\u201d said Brian A. Michael, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations Philadelphia. \u201cThat amount of artwork was not something you come across in every investigation.\u201d\n  It turned out, Mr. Belciano used the art to launder some of his drug cash, purchasing the works from an established gallery near Philadelphia\u2019s Museum Row.\n In 2015, he was  sentenced to more than five years in prison for dealing drugs and for laundering the illicit proceeds by taking advantage of one of the art market\u2019s signature features \u2014 its opacity.\n Billions of dollars of art changes hands every year with little or no public scrutiny. Buyers typically have no idea where the work they are purchasing is coming from. Sellers are similarly in the dark about where a work is going. And none of the purchasing requires the filing of paperwork that would allow regulators to easily track art sales or profits, a distinct difference from the way the government can review the transfer of other substantial assets, like stocks or real estate.\n But now authorities who fear the Belciano case is no longer an oddity, but a parable of how useful art has become as a tool for money launderers, are considering boosting oversight of the market and making it more transparent.\n In January,  Congress extended federal anti-money laundering regulations, designed to govern the banking industry, to antiquities dealers. The legislation required the Department of the Treasury to join with other agencies to study whether the stricter regulations should be imposed on the  wider art market as well. The U.S. effort follows laws recently  adopted in Europe, where dealers and auction houses must now determine the identity of their clients and check the source of their wealth.\n \u201cSecrecy, anonymity and a lack of regulation create an environment ripe for laundering money and evading sanctions,\u201d the U.S. Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said  in a report last July in support of increased scrutiny.\n  To art world veterans, who associate anonymity with discretion, tradition and class, not duplicity, this siege on secrecy is an overreaction that will damage the market. They worry about alienating customers with probing questions when they say there is scant evidence of abuse.\n \u201cWe are in the paranoid-terrified phase of what\u2019s going to come down the pike,\u201d Andrew Schoelkopf, then the president of the Art Dealers Association of America, said at  an industry panel this year. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a whole lot of paperwork and a whole lot of compliance and I don\u2019t think we will extinguish much of a problem.\u201d\n Their concerns are great enough that lobbyists for the dealers\u2019 association and major auction houses have been trying in Washington to shape the evolving policy on this and other regulatory measures. Since 2019, the lobbying bill for Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and the dealers\u2019 association has approached $1 million.\n Still, there is no question the art market has exploded in value and scope from the sleepy days when its customs were created. Paintings routinely sell for $10 million, $20 million, often as much as the penthouses in which they hang. Though the profits from art sales are subject to the robust capital gains tax on luxury goods of 28 percent, the I.R.S.\u2019s ability to track who is accurately reporting windfalls is something of a struggle. Even figuring out who sold what is a hurdle. Half the purchases are in private, not at public auction, so many prices never become public.\n Recent  studies have projected substantial tax evasion by the richest Americans, which led to President Biden\u2019s  plan to boost audits. While there is no evidence of widespread cheating involving art, experts say it\u2019s clear the secrecy of the market creates vulnerabilities for an enforcement system that rarely conducts audits and relies heavily on the willingness of collectors to make plain their profits.\n \u201cThe only ones who know,\u201d said Khrista McCarden, a professor at Tulane Law School who specializes in the tax code, \u201care you, the art gallery and God.\u201d\n  The secrets of the art world sometimes tumble out at places like the Eden Rock hotel on St. Barts, where in a lunch in 2014 overlooking the turquoise waters of St. Jean Bay, the Russian billionaire Dmitry E. Rybolovlev, a collector, was introduced to Sandy Heller, a New York art adviser. Naturally, the conversation turned to art, and money.\n  Mr. Rybolovlev had paid $118 million for a Modigliani nude from an unknown seller. Mr. Heller confirmed that the seller had been his client, the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen. But something was off. Mr. Cohen had charged only $93.5 million, Heller said.\n Mr. Rybolovlev had used an art adviser, Yves Bouvier, to make that and many other purchases, totaling nearly $2 billion. It turned out Mr. Bouvier was buying the works at one price and flipping them at huge markups to his client.\n Mr. Bouvier has said it was always clear he was operating as an independent seller who could buy the art and resell on his own terms. But  in the legal battle that has ensued, Mr. Rybolovlev has castigated not only his former adviser, but the art world itself.\n \u201cIf the market were more transparent, these things wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n  What is the origin of such secrecy? Experts say it likely dates to the earliest days of the art market in the 15th and 16th centuries when the Guilds of St. Luke, professional trade organizations, began to regulate the production and sale of art in Europe. Until then, art was not so much sold as commissioned by aristocratic or clerical patrons. But as a merchant class expanded, so did an art market, operating from workshops and public stalls in cities like Antwerp. To thwart competitors, it made sense to conceal the identity of one\u2019s clients so they could not be stolen, or to keep secret what they charged one customer so they could charge another client a different price, incentives to guard information that persist today.\n  The market is less secretive than it once was. Auction houses, for example, today publish estimates of prices they expect artworks to achieve. But so much about it remains opaque, which lends an air of mystery and romance to a world where values and profits can rely on something as capricious as a fleeting consensus on genius.\n Auction catalogs say works are from \u201ca private collection,\u201d often nothing more. Paintings are at times brought to market by representatives of owners whose identities are unknown, even to the galleries arranging the sale, experts  and officials say. Purchasers use surrogates, too. When Mr. Rybolovlev sold Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, for example, it was bought by a friend of the prince, which obscured who was shopping.\n In these circumstances, the galleries rely on the integrity of the agents, with whom they have long done business. Sometimes the buyers and sellers are not individuals at all, but shell companies, opaque investment structures often designed to conceal identity.\n \u201cVery rarely is anybody buying a $5 million painting as a person because they don\u2019t buy anything else that way,\u201d said Cristin Tierney, a New York gallerist.\n And once works are purchased, many of them, including some of the world\u2019s most expressive and expensive, end up  hidden away in cavernous, nondescript, tax-sheltered free ports, their whereabouts largely unknown.\n \u201cThe variety of frauds in the art world is almost infinite and that is facilitated by the fact that the art world operates with a secrecy that no other investor would dream of operating in,\u201d said Herbert Lazerow, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law.\n  Now the federal government is considering using a law designed to combat money laundering at financial institutions to further regulate the art market. The law, the  Bank Secrecy Act, requires banks to report cash transactions of more than $10,000, highlight suspicious activity and understand the identity of their customers and where their wealth comes from.\n Congress has  already authorized Treasury officials to tailor the regulations to fit the antiquities market, which has long been burdened by worries about illicit artifacts trafficked from countries like Syria and Iraq. Now dealers of ancient treasures like Roman marble statues or Egyptian reliefs will be treated like financial institutions, and federal regulators will study whether the restrictions should be extended to the broader art market.\n Antiquities dealers are concerned about the cost of complying with the so-called AML (anti-money laundering) regulations. They say they already know their customers well enough to know they are not engaged in illicit activities.\n Randall Hixenbaugh, a New York antiquities dealer, complained that small businesses would be forced to hire compliance officers. \u201cI can\u2019t even afford to hire a full-time assistant in this horrible economic climate,\u201d he said in an email.\n  If the new strictures are extended to the much broader art market, dealers and auction houses would likely be required by law to determine who the actual owners are, even pierce the veils of shell companies.\n Christie\u2019s said it \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to work with U.S. regulators on appropriate and enforceable\u201d guidelines. Sotheby\u2019s said it \u201chas long-established due diligence procedures and will comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d\n Auction houses have already responded to the changes in Europe with more thorough vetting of their customers in the United States, too. Christie\u2019s says sellers at its New York auctions must fully disclose their identity. For buyers, it says it verifies the identity of any agent and works to identify the sources of funds when there is any suggestion of risk.\n But last year, Senate investigators found gaps in the policies the art market now has in place. Auction houses and dealers  were cited for having allowed two Russian oligarchs, close to President Vladimir V. Putin and under sanctions, to buy and sell art using shell companies fronted by an art adviser. The subcommittee concluded that the auction houses, in transactions between 2011 and 2019, did not determine who the real owners were despite professing to have adopted safeguards.\n Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican and a sponsor of the report, said  \u201cthe art industry cannot be trusted to self-police.\u201d\n \u201cWhile the auction houses claimed to have robust anti-money laundering programs, we found that the actual employees who facilitated the transactions never asked who the art intermediary was buying the painting for or where the money was coming from,\u201d he said in a statement.\n Even if the tighter rules were adopted, the names of buyers and sellers would not become public. But dealers and auction houses would need to determine who they are dealing with in case of law enforcement inquiry.\n  How much money laundering involves art? No one seems to have quantified it, though many experts agree the art market is  a natural place for it to flourish. \u201cPieces are portable, there is a high level of secrecy around who owns what and the value that they\u2019re paying, and it\u2019s debatable in some ways,\u201d said Nienke Palstra, a researcher at Global Witness.\n Still, the number of prosecutions that have been made would not, by itself, suggest the problem is ubiquitous.\n In a typical case, someone uses illicit profits to purchase art, parking the money there until a later sale results in \u201cclean\u201d money with a legitimate pedigree. A famous case concerns the financier Jho Low, who  prosecutors say helped siphon billions of dollars from a Malaysian government fund employing a network of bank accounts and shell companies. He then laundered the money, prosecutors say, via a spending spree on things like art. In 2014, a Cayman Island company he owned received a $107 million  loan from Sotheby\u2019s using some of the art as collateral. (Mr. Low denied any wrongdoing and remains at large.)\n  Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s said they stopped doing business with him once they knew he was under investigation. They were not accused of wrongdoing.\n Some experts say enforcement efforts have simply been too anemic to detect laundering, and that the size of the problem will become apparent if dealers and auction houses are required to report suspicious activities.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know,\u201d said Peter D. Hardy, a former U.S. prosecutor.\n Advisers to collectors say they also do not believe that the opacity of art transactions has led to major cheating on the reporting of capital gains, even though dealers have no obligation to provide independent reporting of sales to the government.\n \u201cCollectors are savvy business people of prominent standing in their communities,\u201d said Michael Plummer, principal at an art management and investment firm in New York, \u201cand advised by sophisticated tax and legal professionals \u2014 saving tax dollars by not reporting capital gains and committing outright tax fraud is just not worth the risk to their other business and social interests.\u201d\n In cases where people fail to report the profits from art sales, some advisers think the banking system is able to flag possible tax evasion. But other experts said the ranks of I.R.S. and other regulators were too thin to follow up on the millions of banking alerts that come in each year.\n \u201cThey get so many reports, they could not possibly follow up on all of them,\u201d said Julie A. Hill, a University of Alabama School of Law professor.\n  Four months after his arrest, Ronald Belciano returned to I. Brewster &amp; Co., the Philadelphia gallery where, investigators said, he had bought the art he used to launder money.\n But he was not there to shop for himself. Instead, he introduced the gallery owner, Nathan Isen, to Lisa, who he identified as a drug dealer with lots of cash to spend on art, according to court records.\n  \u201cLike, I\u2019m willing to invest in stuff like this, but this I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, according to a transcript of their conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to sell this. Cars, other things I can get rid of easy. Like this I\u2019m nervous about.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s different than selling a car,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2019cause car has to have the registration, the title, and this and that and everything. \u2026 These are nothing. \u2026 These could have been, these could have been your grandmother\u2019s. You follow me?\u201d\n \u201cSo I can say, \u2018hey, this is stuff that I inherited not that I bought,\u2019\u201d Lisa asked.\n \u201cRight. \u2018I found it at a thrift store, they were $10 a piece,\u2019\u201d Mr. Isen replied.\n Mr. Isen had not been accused of wrongdoing in Belciano\u2019s case and has denied knowing Mr. Belciano was using the art to launder money, but as a result of his conversations with Lisa, who was an undercover agent wearing a wire, he would later be charged with money laundering and plead guilty in 2015. He was sentenced to 320 hours of community service and received a $15,000 fine.\n A week after their first conversation, Lisa returned to Mr. Isen\u2019s gallery to buy 12 Salvador Dal\u00ed lithographs for $20,000. She had the cash in a brown paper bag. It smelled of drugs, she told the gallerist, because she kept it with her marijuana stash.\n He told her she was not getting an invoice for her purchases, according to the court papers.\n \u201cNo invoices? Cool,\u201d she replied. \u201cNo receipt, no invoice, I\u2019m good with that. That\u2019s the way I like to do business.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 12:30:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Texas is one of   several states suffering through a record-breaking heat wave that\u2019s pushing electric grids to their limits. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, has   urged residents to do their part by raising the temperature on their thermostats, but several smart thermostats owners say their devices have been controlled remotely to conserve energy, leaving them in sweltering homes without a clue as to why.\n  Turns out, some of them just didn\u2019t read the fine print. Several residents in the Houston area said they\u2019d unknowingly enrolled in a program called \u201cSmart Savers Texas\u201d as part of a promotion, according to a report from local ABC-affiliate   WFAA on Friday. The agreement states that in exchange for an entry into sweepstakes, electric customers grant permission for the program\u2019s operator, EnergyHub, to control their thermostats during periods of high energy demand.\n Brandon English, one of the residents WFAA spoke with, said he arrived home from work on Wednesday to find the temperature on his smart thermostat had been jacked up while his wife and newborn daughter napped.\n    \u201cThey\u2019d been asleep long enough that the house had already gotten to 78 degrees,\u201d English said. \u201cSo they woke up sweating.\u201d\n  He unenrolled from the program as soon as he found out and expressed concern about how the remote temperature adjustment could affect his family\u2019s health.\n   \u201cWas my daughter at the point of overheating?\u201d English told WFAA. \u201cShe\u2019s 3 months old. They dehydrate very quickly.\u201d\n EnergyHub\u2019s website says it\u2019s partnered with several thermostat providers, including   Google and Amazon, and its   list of clients includes major energy companies such as National Grid, CenterPoint Energy, and ERCOT.\n  During energy saving events, the program \u201cincreases the temperature on participating thermostats by up to four degrees to reduce energy consumption and relieve stress on the grid,\u201d said Erika Diamond, vice president of customer solutions at EnergyHub, in an emailed statement to Gizmodo on Saturday. She added that customers will typically receive an offer to join the program from their energy provider or the manufacturer of their thermostat and can opt-out at any time. On average, these energy saving events occur between two to eight times each summer, Diamond told   USA Today.\n In a statement to Houston-based NBC affiliate   KPRC 2, CenterPoint Energy said it conducted a \u201ctest curtailment event\u201d on June 16 from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and notified EnergyHub to reduce energy consumption for their residential customers that agreed to participate in the Smart Savers Texas program. Once it received the notification, EnergyHub adjusted the thermostats for participating customers.\n   \u201cSmart Savers Texas helps support grid reliability by working with thermostat manufacturer and security dealer partners to sign up connected thermostat owners to participate in reducing energy use when the grid needs it most.\n Thermostat owners typically receive an offer to participate from their manufacturer or service provider within their mobile app or via email. During a demand response event, Smart Savers Texas increases the temperature on participating thermostats by up to four degrees to reduce energy consumption and relieve stress on the grid. Every participant actively agrees to the terms of the program and can opt-out of a demand response event at any time.\n  The ability to reduce energy consumption is critical to managing the grid, in Texas and nationwide. EnergyHub works with more than 50 utilities across the country to harness connected devices to meet grid needs. This is a tool to reliably reduce load on the grid enabled through the technology of EnergyHub and our connected thermostat partners.\u201d\n         In other words, Texas consumers too stupid to read the contracts they\u2019re signing.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 12:29:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Harvard professor has made the news for being the easy mark of grifters. Take  the law professor who, over the course of four years, found himself drawn into a web of fraud and false accusations, until he was finally out of a job, homeless, and out $300,000 in legal fees to defend himself.\n In another case,  a Harvard scientist working in cancer research heartlessly conned his own trusting friends and colleagues, some of whom lost their homes and savings, out of $600,000. He promptly, but naively, sent it all to Nigerian scammers, who had promised him a cool $50 million in return. After being arrested, he still could not admit to having been fooled himself after fooling so many of the people around him.\n   It just goes to show that even the smartest person can still be as gullible or as greedy as the rest of us, if the conditions are right.\n Researchers often have pondered  the psychology of how and why certain people fall for scams, especially ones that appear to be so obvious to others.  Scammers target certain human traits, including vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited, such as naivet\u00e9,\u00a0overconfidence in one\u2019s intelligence or abilities, an overly optimistic expectation of immediate success in life, or a desire to feel good about helping others. As communication on the internet has gotten more sophisticated,  so have the scams. Many still fall for it, as con artists continue to target businesses as well as individuals.\n Before you even get to the level of a personal interaction with a mysterious Nigerian prince, however,  this short study by linguist Deborah Schaffer can give you the 4-1-9 on how to recognize the linguistic patterns of a scam email when it first enters your inbox and greets you in flattering, if broken, flowery language.\n    Nigerian 419 cons (the number refers to the fraud section of the Nigerian Criminal Code) are practically the oldest scams on the internet. They can actually be traced back to the 1920s, in the form of a confidence trick most gothically known as the Spanish Prisoner. The victims are asked to pay out more and more money to release the wealthy relative of your respectable foreign correspondents (who naturally doesn\u2019t exist), cruelly imprisoned in Spain, in return for a large reward (that never comes).\n In the updated 419 Nigerian scam, the potential mark is asked to pay a small advance fee, or asked to send their bank information or personal details to help move funds that have been locked up, perhaps in a foreign country, or somewhere plausibly difficult. In return, they\u2019re promised a much larger fund in return. As the story goes, perhaps it comes from the coffers of a prince in exile, a government official on the take, or a dying philanthropist anxious to bequeath his or her wealth upon a deserving email recipient.\n While Schaffer found half of her collection of 419 emails originated from Nigeria, the rest were from elsewhere, often other African and Middle Eastern countries. What\u2019s really interesting is how language is used in these con jobs. The stories are colorful variations of each other, but the language used to tell them are key to capturing a potential mark\u2019s (greedy) imagination, relieving their fears, and building a bond and relationship between an ongoing victim and grifter.\n It\u2019s well-known that most of the emails are composed by nonnative speakers of English, as is clear from the many grammatical and punctuation mistakes, broken syntax, missing words, and malapropisms ( \u201cthe will to personify the fa\u00e7ade to its practical conclusion\u201d for  \u201cpursue the charade\u201d). With so many mistakes, how can this language really fool anyone? Often, victims know the message comes from a nonnative speaker, or they may be nonnative English speakers themselves and may not always recognize grammatical errors. These are the ludicrous linguistic warning signs that helpfully remove most people who are savvy enough to escape the trap and leave the much smaller percentage who stay to be intrigued, starry-eyed, by an implausible story.\n Despite this lack of English fluency, the scammers seem to have read and absorbed the most swashbuckling tales of linguistic derring do. 419 scam emails are full of unusually florid language, meant to persuade and cajole the reader into biting the bullet and complying, such as in opening greetings ( \u201cCompliments of the season, and I pray that this mail meet you in go\u201d) and apologies ( \u201cPardon the abruptness of this letter; it is due to its exigency\u201d). Scammers make liberal use of flattery ( \u201cYou have been recommended by an associate who assured me in confidence of your ability and reliability in prosecuting a business transaction of high net value requiring maximum confidentiality.\u201d), religious appeals invoking God in the hopes of finding common ground, even secrecy and intrigue ( \u201cFirst, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.\u201d).\n Schaffer also shows how 419 scammers use strategies such as pressuring readers to act now before it\u2019s too late ( \u201cGet Back To Me Urgently!\u201d) and assuring them that the proposed schemes are quite safe ( \u201cThis transaction is 100% risk free\u201d) and of immense worth and value. The scammers make extraordinary efforts to use technical, military, financial or otherwise professional language in a clumsy caricature of what formal, educated English sounds like ( \u201cgovernment officials . . . awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals\u201d) to keep up the pretence of being a barrister, a brigadier-general, or a bank official.\n  You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\n  This is all wrapped up in unrealistic, yet intriguing narratives that many ordinary people are not familiar with, of the lives of dead millionaires\u2019 relatives, down on their luck, philanthropists and princes who want to do good for others, distressed business executives and oil tycoons, all who\u2019ve lost their way and need your help. By telling these tall tales, and playing on sympathy, grifters try to entice their victims into a bond that keeps them deeply invested in the scheme and the outcome for as long as possible. The longer they feel invested and loyal, the more they\u2019ll continue to deny it\u2019s a scam. Sometimes they never do.\n The language scammers use to impress and flatter is so obvious and amateurish that it can seem astonishing that anyone could ever be taken in. Yet many ordinary people do fall into the trap every year. The language, however puzzling, is designed to be persuasive as part of story victims are often wishing and wanting to be real. It\u2019s a simple scam, but appears to be effective when it reaches credulous types who are willing to ignore the warning signs in search of a treasure hunting adventure that can make a life extraordinary for a while, before it all ends in grief.\n        JSTOR is a digital library for scholars, researchers, and students.
