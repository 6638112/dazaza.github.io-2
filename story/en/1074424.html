The chickens are under threat of frostbite, the dog has to be pushed outside, and our jeans are bulky from long underwear; the weather app shows negative numbers in the evenings. Cold is something we are subject to—it hurts, and all we can do is dress for it. I can’t prevent the storm that encases my car in ice any more than I can disperse the sticky air of a subway station in July.</p><p>我们家住的卡茨基尔一直很冷。鸡受到冻伤的威胁，狗不得不被推到外面，我们的牛仔裤从长内衣里脱下来，显得笨重；天气应用程序在晚上显示负数。寒冷是我们所受的伤害，我们所能做的就是为它穿衣服。我无法阻止暴风雪把我的车困在冰里，就像我无法驱散7月份地铁站的粘乎乎的空气一样。</p><p> And yet hints of another world push back against the cold. In 1981, Herbert Benson, then a physician at Harvard Medical School, travelled to the Himalayas to take the temperatures of three Buddhist monks. The monks had been living in near-solitude for nearly a decade, in small stone huts without heat or insulation at elevations of six thousand feet or higher; they’d been practicing g-tummo, a secret meditation technique, every day for several years. Benson attached disk thermometers to several parts of each monk’s body, during meditation or afterward. In a study published in the prestigious journal  Nature, he reported that, while meditating, the monks could increase the temperature in their fingers and toes by up to seventeen degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists had previously documented the possibility of a person heating her own extremities using biofeedback, but those temperature increases had been slight. Here was evidence that a person could be his own furnace.</p><p>然而，另一个世界的迹象却在对抗寒冷。1981年，时任哈佛医学院医生的赫伯特·本森（Herbert Benson）前往喜马拉雅山为三名佛教僧侣测体温。僧侣们近十年来一直生活在近乎孤独的地方，住在海拔6000英尺或更高的小石屋里，没有暖气或隔热材料；几年来，他们每天都在练习g-tummo，这是一种秘密的冥想技巧。在冥想期间或之后，本森在每个僧侣身体的几个部位安装了盘式温度计。在一项发表在著名杂志《自然》上的研究中，他报告说，在冥想时，僧侣们可以将手指和脚趾的温度提高17华氏度。科学家以前曾记录过一个人使用生物反馈加热自己四肢的可能性，但这些温度升高幅度很小。这里有证据表明一个人可能是他自己的熔炉。</p><p> A few years later, Russ Pariseau, a documentary filmmaker who was covering Benson’s research, stood behind his camera in a prayer room in Manali, Himachal Pradesh, in India. The room was cold, about forty degrees. A group of monks wearing only undergarments sat on the floor, along with a few buckets of cool water. As Pariseau’s camera rolled, the monks dipped thin white sheets in the buckets, then draped the wet sheets around their backs and shoulders. They began g-tummo. In an e-mail, Pariseau recalled that he soon noticed “vapor rising from bodies all around.” The room began “noticeably warming up.” The event was a friendly competition among advanced students to see who could dry the greatest number of sheets—“something like a championship tournament.” On another winter night, Pariseau witnessed several monks sleeping on a stone ledge somewhere between the Himalayan and Karakoram mountains. “I was dressed in layers of down but still uncomfortably cold,” he said. The monks were wearing thin shawls of wool or cotton.</p><p>几年后，在印度喜马偕尔邦玛纳利的一间祈祷室里，报道本森研究的纪录片制作人鲁斯·帕里索站在相机后面。房间里很冷，大约40度。一群只穿内衣的僧侣坐在地板上，还有几桶凉水。帕里索的相机转动时，僧侣们将薄薄的白床单浸入桶中，然后将湿床单披在后背和肩膀上。他们开始了g-tummo。在一封电子邮件中，帕里索回忆说，他很快就注意到“蒸汽从四周的尸体上升起。”房间开始“明显升温”这是一场高级学生之间的友谊赛，看谁能烘干最多的床单——“有点像锦标赛。”在另一个冬夜，帕里索看到几名僧侣睡在喜马拉雅山和喀喇昆仑山之间的石壁上。“我穿着一层层羽绒服，但仍然冷得令人不舒服，”他说。僧侣们披着羊毛或棉质的薄披肩。</p><p> Maria Kozhevnikov, a neuroscientist at the National University of Singapore and Massachusetts General Hospital who also holds an appointment in radiology at Harvard Medical School, wasn’t that impressed by Benson’s study. The steaming sheets, she figured, were just the physics of water hitting cold air—like seeing your breath on a frigid day. And what was so special about heating up one’s digits? “It’s not unusual,” she told me. “Anyone can imagine putting their fingers into warm water and eventually the peripheral body temperature could be increased.”</p><p>新加坡国立大学和麻省总医院的神经学家Maria Kozhevnikov也在哈佛医学院接受了放射学的任命，这并不是本森的研究留下的印象。她认为，这些热气腾腾的床单只是水撞击冷空气的物理过程，就像在寒冷的日子里看到你的呼吸一样。加热手指有什么特别之处？“这并不罕见，”她告诉我。“任何人都可以想象将手指放入温水中，最终周围体温可能会升高。”</p><p> Kozhevnikov wanted to know if the monks could raise their core body temperatures. That’s a harder problem: maintaining an internal temperature of 98.6 degrees is more or less a requirement of having a human body on Earth. She travelled to Nangchen town, in the Amdo region of Tibet, an area known for g-tummo practice. There, she took the core body temperatures of several monks and nuns during meditation. It was January, and even inside the house where she ran the experiment the temperature hovered between thirty-two and thirty-six degrees. Kozhevnikov taped disk thermometers to the meditators’ armpits, attaching them to a computer, which allowed her to obtain readings without being in the room with the nuns. Her skepticism changed to awe as she watched the data emerge. “It was amazing,” she said. “You see the core body temperature change.” It wasn’t just that they increased their core body temperature; aerobic exercise can do that, too. It was that the meditators gave themselves fevers. At least one monk raised his body temperature from 98.6 degrees to 100.8.</p><p>科兹夫尼科夫想知道僧侣们是否能提高核心体温。这是一个更难的问题：维持98.6度的内部温度或多或少是地球上有人体的一个要求。她去了西藏安多地区的南陈镇，那里以通摩练习而闻名。在那里，她在冥想时测量了几位僧侣和尼姑的核心体温。那是一月份，即使在她进行实验的房子里，温度也徘徊在32到36度之间。Kozhevnikov将盘式温度计贴在冥想者的腋下，并将其连接到计算机上，这样她就可以在不与修女在房间的情况下获取读数。当她看到数据出现时，她的怀疑变成了敬畏。“太棒了，”她说。“你可以看到核心体温的变化。”这不仅仅是因为他们提高了核心体温；有氧运动也可以做到这一点。是冥想者让自己发烧。至少有一名僧人将体温从98.6度提高到100.8度。</p><p>  In Kozhevnikov’s report, published with some colleagues in the journal  PLOS One, she explains that g-tummo involves a breathing technique called “the vase,” in which meditators contract their abdominal and pelvic muscles. They picture a flame rising from below the navel to the top of the head. I asked Kozhevnikov if she could share more about how g-tummo is done; she told me that she’d agreed to keep the practice confidential as a condition of her visit. “They visualize the spine being on fire,” she said. G-tummo meditation, she went on, is not a state of relaxation but arousal. She thinks it may increase blood flow to the brain. G-tummo is difficult, requiring years of dedication to master. As I contemplated whether it could help me cope with the cold, it occurred to me that using this sacred technique to avoid discomfort might not be in line with its origins in Buddhism, a religion in which suffering is acknowledged and accepted. Kozhevnikov thinks that it could be useful for pilots and astronauts who run the risk of losing consciousness during acceleration; for the average cold-averse person, though, she suggested sticking to the imagination. Try “visualizing your fingers in hot water, or yourself in a hot environment,” she said. It might not raise your core body temperature, but it could make you cozier.</p><p>Kozhevnikov的报告与一些同事发表在《公共科学图书馆·综合》杂志上，她在报告中解释说，g-tummo涉及一种被称为“花瓶”的呼吸技术，冥想者在其中收缩腹部和骨盆肌肉。他们想象火焰从肚脐下面升到头顶。我问Kozhevnikov她是否可以分享更多关于g-tummo是如何完成的；她告诉我，她已同意将这一做法保密，作为她来访的条件。“他们想象着脊柱着火了，”她说。她接着说，G-tummo冥想不是一种放松状态，而是一种唤醒状态。她认为这可能会增加流向大脑的血液流量。G-tummo很难，需要多年的努力才能掌握。当我思考它是否能帮助我应对寒冷时，我突然想到，使用这种神圣的技巧来避免不适可能与它起源于佛教不符，佛教承认并接受痛苦。Kozhevnikov认为，它可能对在加速过程中有失去意识风险的飞行员和宇航员有用；不过，对于一般厌恶寒冷的人来说，她建议坚持想象力。她说，试着“想象你的手指在热水中，或者你自己在炎热的环境中”。它可能不会提高你的核心体温，但会让你更舒适。</p><p> Meditation and visualization aren’t the only ways to self-generate heat. Anger makes us hot under the collar. Romantic crushes make us sweaty. The same is true for embarrassment, and for menopause. Clearly there are mechanisms in our bodies designed to heat us up, either as a goal or a side effect, and there is a tight link between our behavior and our temperature. Most of the research seeking to understand why our cheeks start burning when we trip on the sidewalk involves the fight-or-flight response. The release of adrenaline triggered by such moments gives us a burst of survival-driven energy, and that’s accompanied by a surge of heat.</p><p>冥想和想象并不是自我产生热量的唯一方式。愤怒使我们感到愤怒。浪漫的迷恋让我们汗流浃背。尴尬和更年期也是如此。很明显，我们的身体中存在着加热我们的机制，无论是作为目标还是作为副作用，我们的行为和我们的体温之间有着紧密的联系。大多数研究试图理解为什么我们在人行道上绊倒时脸颊会开始灼热，其中包括打架或逃跑反应。由这些时刻引发的肾上腺素释放给我们一股由生存驱动的能量，伴随着一股热浪。</p><p> Could the process be reverse-engineered? Could we force a bout of heat-inducing anger that blunts a brutal wind chill? If you wanted to do that, you’d first need a map showing which body parts heat up in response to which kinds of thoughts. In fact, we have the technology to create such a map, courtesy of the U.S. military. Modern soldiers find people in the dark using thermal imagery, which detects heat radiated by the human body; as soon as the technology was declassified, in 1992, it became available for psychological experiments.</p><p>这个过程可以被逆向工程吗？我们能强迫一轮热引发的愤怒来缓和残酷的风寒吗？如果你想这样做，你首先需要一张地图，显示身体的哪些部位会随着哪种想法而升温。事实上，我们有技术来制作这样的地图，这是美国军方提供的。现代士兵使用热成像技术在黑暗中发现人，热成像技术检测人体辐射的热量；1992年，这项技术一解密，就可用于心理实验。</p><p>  Emilio Gómez Milán, a research psychologist at the University of Granada, in Spain, has conducted several psycho-thermal studies. In 2018, he and some colleagues told ten psychology students that they were part of a top-secret research program, and that they needed to call a friend or relative and lie about their current whereabouts. A control group were asked to make similar phone calls, but were allowed to reveal that, in fact, they were part of an experiment. Using thermal imagery, the researchers found that the noses of seven lying students grew hotter by two degrees before the calls, while they were crafting their alibis; during the calls themselves, nose temperatures among eight students dropped by two degrees. Forehead temperature also increased during the planning stage—and then, for six of the students, increased again during the telling of the lie itself. Gómez Milán and his colleagues speculated about the warming and cooling. Perhaps the initial nose and forehead warming could be attributed to the anxiety of planning to lie, and the subsequent forehead warming to the mental workload of maintaining the ruse; after the lying was finished, anxiety lessened, along with facial temperatures. In the end, changes in nose and forehead temperature enabled the researchers to determine liars with eighty-five per cent accuracy. This “Pinocchio effect,” as Gómez Milán calls it, may be connected to hypothalamus activation, and also to the insula, a part of the brain’s reward system which is activated by emotions and involved in regulating body temperature.</p><p>西班牙格拉纳达大学的研究心理学家Emilio G·米兹•米尔曾进行了多项心理热学研究。2018年，他和一些同事告诉十名心理学学生，他们是一个绝密研究项目的一部分，他们需要给朋友或亲戚打电话，谎报他们目前的行踪。一个对照组被要求打类似的电话，但被允许透露，事实上，他们是实验的一部分。研究人员利用热成像技术发现，7名说谎学生在打电话之前，当他们在捏造不在场证明时，他们的鼻子会变热2度；在通话过程中，8名学生的鼻温下降了2度。在计划阶段，额头温度也会升高，然后，对于六名学生来说，在说谎的过程中，额头温度再次升高。戈梅斯·米兰和他的同事们推测气候变暖和降温。也许最初的鼻子和额头变暖可能是由于计划撒谎的焦虑，而随后的额头变暖可能是由于维持诡计的精神负担；说谎结束后，焦虑感和面部温度都有所减轻。最后，鼻子和前额温度的变化使研究人员能够以85%的准确率确定说谎者。戈梅兹·米兰（Gómez Milán）称之为“匹诺曹效应”，它可能与下丘脑的激活有关，也与脑岛有关，脑岛是大脑奖励系统的一部分，由情绪激活，参与调节体温。</p><p>  In the name of psycho-thermal research, Gómez Milán has put study volunteers into tense imaginary situations. He has asked them to decide whether they’d call the police on a loved one suspected of having terrorist ties, whether to pay a ransom to free a journalist being tortured by the Taliban, and whether U.S. soldiers should stop or continue the torture of an Islamic terrorist who may have information about a forthcoming attack in Spain. In all these studies, temperatures shifted in specific ways related to emotion and calculation. “In economic dilemmas hot decisions are the emotional ones and cold decisions are the rational ones,” Gómez Milán told me. When the sympathetic nervous system prepares us to deal with an emergency—stopping the torture, for example—nose temperature decreases. As the parasympathetic system takes over and we calm down, nose temperature tends to rise. Yet the effects vary depending on whether a person is already in a state of arousal or relaxation. The effects are complicated. Passion can make a nose cold; tenderness can make it warm; mental fatigue heats the forehead and cools the nose. All this may not be very helpful as you wait for a bus on a cold night.</p><p>戈梅斯·米兰以心理热研究的名义，将研究志愿者置于紧张的想象情境中。他已要求他们决定是否会就涉嫌与恐怖分子有联系的亲人报警，是否支付赎金以释放一名被塔利班折磨的记者，以及美国士兵是否应该停止或继续折磨一名可能掌握西班牙即将发生袭击的信息的伊斯兰恐怖分子。在所有这些研究中，温度的变化都与情绪和计算有关。“在经济困境中，热决策是情绪化的，冷决策是理性的，”戈梅兹·米兰告诉我。当交感神经系统为我们应对紧急情况做好准备时，比如停止酷刑，鼻温就会降低。随着副交感神经系统的接管，我们冷静下来，鼻温往往会上升。然而，效果取决于一个人是否已经处于觉醒或放松状态。影响是复杂的。激情会让鼻子发冷；温柔能使它温暖；精神疲劳使额头发热，鼻子变凉。当你在寒冷的夜晚等公共汽车时，所有这些可能都没有多大帮助。</p><p> Enough already, you might say—there are four seasons, and you must live with them. There’s a lot of pressure to embrace the cold. The Dutch athlete Wim Hof, a.k.a. the Iceman, plunges into icy water with a tolerance that makes him just as awe-inspiring as the self-heating monks; he argues that this exposure, combined with a breathing technique that helps him withstand extreme cold, has enabled his immune system to resist serious bacterial infections. There is some  evidence to support this claim. In one study, mice that have been genetically engineered to have reduced body temperatures lived longer than non-mutated mice. Some research has suggested that cold showers ward off depressive symptoms.</p><p>够了，你可以说有四季，你必须和它们一起生活。接受寒冷有很大的压力。荷兰运动员维姆·霍夫（Wim Hof，又名冰人）跳入冰冷的水中，他的忍耐力让他和自热僧侣一样令人敬畏；他认为，这种暴露，加上帮助他抵御严寒的呼吸技术，使他的免疫系统能够抵抗严重的细菌感染。有一些证据支持这一说法。在一项研究中，通过基因工程降低体温的小鼠比未经突变的小鼠寿命更长。一些研究表明，冷水浴可以预防抑郁症状。</p><p> I prefer to model my own defense mechanisms on certain honeybees who, when faced with a dangerous giant hornet, swarm around it to create what scientists call a “hot defensive bee ball.” They beat their wings until the air heats so much that it kills the invader. The unity here is inspiring, and so is the amount of heat generated just by being together. I’m also a fan of the Arctic ground squirrel: in Alaska, these rodents, which can weigh just a pound and look like tiny-eared mice covered in lush fur, begin hibernating in late summer. In the days before they hunker down, their little mouths are stained blue from gorging on enough wild berries to double their weight; they go into their underground nests, plug up the entrances, flop their tails over their heads, and stay that way for several months, during which nearly all of their bodily reactions stop.</p><p>我更喜欢在某些蜜蜂身上模拟我自己的防御机制，当它们面对一只危险的大黄蜂时，会成群结队地围着它，形成科学家所说的“热防御蜂球”它们拍打翅膀，直到空气加热到足以杀死入侵者。这里的团结是鼓舞人心的，仅仅在一起产生的热量也是如此。我也是北极地松鼠的粉丝：在阿拉斯加，这些啮齿类动物在夏末开始冬眠，它们的体重只有一磅，看起来像长着茂密皮毛的小耳鼠。在它们蜷缩下来的前几天，它们的小口被染成了蓝色，因为它们大口大口地吃下了足够多的野生浆果，体重增加了一倍；它们进入地下巢穴，堵住入口，将尾巴垂在头上，并在那里停留几个月，在此期间，几乎所有的身体反应都停止了。</p><p> A few decades ago, Brian Barnes, a zoophysiologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, began trapping Arctic ground squirrels so that he could study their hibernation habits. He also started sticking thermometers into their burrows. He discovered that their body temperatures can plummet to 26.5 degrees Fahrenheit. “That turned out to be a world record,” he told me; no other warm-blooded mammal gets quite that cold. The ability is puzzling, since, like people, Arctic ground squirrels contain a lot of water. How do they survive life below the freezing point? “They’re spending half their lives at a body temperature lower than that of an ice cube, and that’s normal for them,” Barnes said. It turns out that, instead of turning to ice crystals, the water inside the squirrels becomes a supercooled liquid. The animals filter their own bloodstreams, removing particles that might help water turn into ice (dust and pollen play this role on plant surfaces); this enables their blood to keep flowing even at temperatures below freezing. “Think ice-rimmed streams,” Barnes suggested. “It’s quite spectacular.”</p><p>几十年前，阿拉斯加费尔贝克斯大学的动物生理学家Brian Barnes开始捕捉北极松鼠，以便研究它们冬眠的习性。他还开始将温度计插入他们的洞穴。他发现他们的体温可以骤降到26.5华氏度。“这是一项世界纪录，”他告诉我；没有其他温血哺乳动物会那么冷。这种能力令人费解，因为和人类一样，北极地松鼠也含有大量的水。他们如何在冰点以下生存？巴恩斯说：“他们在低于冰块的体温下度过了半生，这对他们来说很正常。”。事实证明，松鼠体内的水不是变成冰晶，而是变成过冷液体。这些动物会过滤自己的血流，去除可能有助于水变成冰的颗粒（灰尘和花粉在植物表面起着这种作用）；这使得他们的血液即使在低于冰点的温度下也能保持流动。巴恩斯建议说：“想想冰边的溪流吧。”。“非常壮观。”</p><p> A southern Californian transplanted to Alaska, Barnes has spent his entire career studying animals that survive extreme cold. Hibernation isn’t sleep, he explained. Instead, it’s a state of “deep torpor.” The brain is active just enough to keep the animal’s heart and lungs operating. Torporous animals are far less responsive than sleeping ones. In the nineteen-sixties, one researcher removed several golden-mantled ground squirrels from their hibernation nests, tossed them in the air, and put them back; the animals stirred briefly during the event but returned to torpor within a day. He took the squirrels from their nests a second time and tossed them in the air again. This time, the animals only sometimes stirred, and their brain temperatures remained near forty degrees the whole time. Having learned that the sensation posed no threat, they stayed in torpor—some through a hundred throws.</p><p>作为一名移植到阿拉斯加的南加州人，巴恩斯整个职业生涯都在研究能在严寒中生存的动物。冬眠不是睡眠，他解释道。相反，这是一种“深度麻木”的状态大脑的活跃程度刚好足以维持动物的心脏和肺的运转。多动症动物的反应远不如睡眠动物。在20世纪60年代，一名研究人员将几只金冠地松鼠从它们的冬眠巢穴中取出，抛到空中，然后放回原处；在活动期间，动物们短暂地搅拌了一下，但在一天之内又恢复了麻木状态。他第二次把松鼠从巢穴里拿出来，再次把它们抛向空中。这一次，这些动物只是偶尔会动一下，它们的大脑温度一直保持在40度左右。在得知这种感觉不构成威胁后，他们保持着麻木的状态，有些人投了100次球。</p><p>  There is enough to love about winter to make a state like that unappealing—no matter how cold it is, I don’t want to be that out of it. Still, Barnes wonders if humans will be able to hibernate someday. Perhaps, if we could elucidate the natural chemical processes involved, we could simulate hibernation by creating a drug that mimics them. Hibernation chemistry might be used to make donated organs last longer, since time is the archenemy of transplantation; when researchers injected blood plasma from hibernating woodchucks into lungs, hearts, and kidneys, some of the organs remained viable for three times longer than usual. Hypothetically, Barnes said, putting a severely injured person into a hibernation state might reduce their bodily demands for oxygen and energy enough to keep them alive until they receive medical attention.</p><p>对冬天的热爱足以让这样一种状态变得毫无吸引力，不管它有多冷，我不想就此置身事外。不过，巴恩斯想知道人类是否有一天能冬眠。也许，如果我们能够阐明其中涉及的自然化学过程，我们可以通过创造一种模仿它们的药物来模拟冬眠。冬眠化学可以用来延长捐赠器官的寿命，因为时间是移植的大敌；当研究人员将冬眠土拨鼠的血浆注射到肺、心脏和肾脏时，一些器官的存活时间比平常长三倍。巴恩斯说，假设将一名严重受伤的人置于冬眠状态，可能会减少他们对氧气和能量的需求，足以维持他们的生命，直到他们得到医疗护理。</p><p> Barnes has made peace with the Alaskan winter. He enjoys the northern lights and the occasional ice festival. He doesn’t visualize fire or do logic problems or attempt torpor. “Layers,” he told me. “That’s how we cope.” During our first full year in the Catskills, my family didn’t see the bare ground for five months; then a mighty thaw melted the deep snow and the layers of ice beneath it, softening the earth. I’d never felt such awe for the changing seasons; I registered in a new way the extreme pleasure of sunlight on bare skin and the vividness of newly grown green. Visualizing spring: another strategy worth trying. That, and layers.</p><p>巴恩斯已经和阿拉斯加的冬天讲和了。他喜欢北极光和偶尔的冰雪节。他不会想象火灾，也不会做逻辑问题，也不会试图麻木。“分层，”他告诉我。“这就是我们的应对方式。”在我们在卡茨基尔的第一年里，我们家有五个月没有看到光秃秃的土地；然后，一场巨大的融化融化了厚厚的积雪和下面的冰层，使大地软化。我从未对季节的变化感到如此敬畏；我以一种新的方式记录了阳光照射在裸露皮肤上的极度愉悦和新长出的绿色的生动。想象春天：另一个值得尝试的策略。那个，还有层次。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/心灵/">#心灵</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warm/">#warm</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/研究/">#研究</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
