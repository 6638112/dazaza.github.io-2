Martin’s claim that they are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up to scrutiny. This is something that I have been suggesting I would get to since (checks notes),  May. Of Last Year. So it is about time we actually get to it.</p><p>这是三部分（第二，三部分）的第一部分，介绍了多斯拉奇（Dothraki），《权力的游戏》 /《冰与火之歌》系列中虚构的马生游牧民族，以及乔治·罗·马丁（George RR Martin）声称他们是“多种草原和平原文化的混合物”经受住了审查。我一直建议我从五月开始（检查笔记）。去年因此，现在是我们真正实现目标的时候了。</p><p> The plan is for this series to run in three parts. Part I (this part) will discuss how the Dothraki  look in the setting. Part II will look at broader questions of social organization and culture (I am nearly certain this is one of those cases where there will be a IIa and a IIb, but my hope for brevity springs eternal). Part III will look at military culture. In all three parts I am going to use both the books and the show – noting where they diverge – in part because the heaviest characterization the Dothraki got in the show was when Martin was still significantly involved with it (meaning that large parts of it likely still reflect his vision), but also because the show is how the vast majority of people experience this particular fiction. Both the original text and the show derived from it deserve to have their vision discussed.</p><p> 该系列计划分三部分进行。第一部分（本部分）将讨论Dothraki在背景中的外观。第二部分将研究社会组织和文化的更广泛的问题（我几乎可以肯定，这是会有IIa和IIb的情况之一，但我对简洁的希望源远流长）。第三部分将探讨军事文化。在这三个部分中，我将同时使用书籍和展览-指出它们之间的差异-部分原因是Dothraki在展览中获得的最重的特征是马丁仍在很大程度上参与其中（这意味着其中很大一部分可能是仍然反映出他的远见），也是因为这个节目是绝大多数人如何体验这种特殊的小说。原始文本和由此产生的展览都应讨论其愿景。</p><p> As always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on  Patreon.

More to the point, it is a discussion of what – I will argue – Martin presents as one of, if not the most brutal and sexually violent society in that setting. And that means those themes are going to come up here (less in this essay, but more in the other parts); we are going to remain serious and adult about those things of course, but they will be a part of this analysis nonetheless. If that is not for you, by all means feel free to check out for a few weeks.</p><p>  首先，本系列的内容警告：这是在讨论《冰与火之歌》和《权力的游戏》，其中包含很多内容，但未获得G级评分。更重要的是，这是关于马丁（如果不是的话）是那种情况下最残酷和性暴力的社会之一的讨论，我会说。这意味着这些主题将在这里出现（在本文中较少，而在其他部分则更多）；当然，我们将对这些事情保持认真和成人的态度，但是它们仍将是此分析的一部分。如果这不适合您，那么请务必退房几周。</p><p> Before we get into the main point,  I want to note that I am going to reference my series on the  Fremen Mirage  a lot here, because there is a lot of Fremen stuff going on with how Dothraki society is depicted. As a result, it may be useful to go back and read those, but just to recap, we may define the Fremen Mirage this way:</p><p> 在进入要点之前，我想指出的是，我将在这里大量参考我的Fremen Mirage系列，因为关于Frethman社会的描绘有很多Fremen的东西。因此，返回并阅读这些内容可能会很有用，但仅是回顾一下，我们可以这样定义Fremen Mirage：</p><p>  Next, a note on citation here from the books. My understanding is that different printings of the books have different pagination, which seems to be why the Wiki of Ice and Fire cites by chapter numbers (except that the chapters of the books, as printed,  aren’t numbered in the print editions I’ve seen, making this classical-style citation extremely cumbersome and inexact). I am going to cite by the page numbers of my edition, which is the 2011 Bantam Books Trade Paperback Edition (the box set). Hopefully that will be enough.</p><p>  接下来，从书中获得关于引文的注释。我的理解是，书籍的不同印刷品具有不同的分页，这似乎就是为什么《冰与火之歌维基》按章节编号引用的原因（除了印刷的书籍各章未在我的印刷版本中编号）我们已经看到，这使得这种古典风格的引用极为繁琐和不精确。我要引用的是我的版本的页码，即2011年Bantam图书贸易平装版（盒装）。希望这足够了。</p><p> Finally, a note on my expertise here.  I am not a scholar of either the peoples of the Eurasian Steppe or the American Great Plains. The former group does intrude into my period and study, as steppe nomads, in the form of Scythians, Sarmatians and Huns did interact (sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently) with the broader Mediterranean world. Consequently, my knowledge of steppe peoples tend to be better that my knowledge of the Native American peoples of the Great Plains, but I have tried, within the limits of time and availability, to do my research.   I actually think, in a strange sense, this is useful, because my own initial unfamiliarity with the topic has demonstrated to me just how  basic the level of research and reading necessary to avoid the failures of this depiction are. You do not, in turns out, need to be an experienced scholar on the topic; just a few books and a couple of emails is enough to already radically improve on what we see and read in  A Song of Ice and Fire, much less the absolute  mess of what we see in  A Game of Thrones.</p><p> 最后，请注意我的专业知识。我不是欧亚草原或美国大平原人民的学者。前者确实入侵了我的时代，像草原游牧民族那样，以斯基泰人，萨尔玛提亚人和匈奴人的形式与整个地中海世界进行了互动（有时是和平的，有时是暴力的）。因此，我对草原民族的了解往往比对大平原美洲原住民的了解要好，但是我尝试在时间和可用性的限制内进行研究。我实际上以一种奇怪的方式认为这是有用的，因为我自己最初对该主题的不熟悉已经向我展示了避免这种描述失败所必需的研究和阅读水平的基础。事实证明，您不需要成为该主题的资深学者。仅几本书和几封电子邮件就足以从根本上改善我们在《冰与火之歌》中所看到和阅读的内容，远没有我们在《权力的游戏》中所看到的完全混乱。 </p><p> Writing this has been tricky. I am well aware that both of these broad cultural groups (that is, Steppe peoples and Plains Native Americans) are often represented in popular culture only in the form of inaccurate and demeaning stereotypes. I do not want to be just another link in that chain of poor understanding. I have thus tried to root my argument here, wherever possible, in either the writings of specialist scholars (there will be more of that next week as we get into subsistence patterns, warfare, etc.) or primary evidence, particularly in terms of  period photographs, when it comes to clothing and dress. With luck I have not erred overmuch.</p><p>写这篇文章很棘手。我很清楚，这两个广泛的文化群体（即草原民族和美国原住民平原）通常仅以不正确和贬低的陈规定型观念在大众文化中得到代表。我不想只是那条理解不周的链中的另一个环节。因此，我试图在这里尽可能地以专业学者的著作（随着下周的生活模式，战争等问题的出现，将会有更多的篇幅）或主要证据，特别是根据时期来论证照片，涉及到衣服和衣服。幸运的是，我并没有犯太多错误。</p><p>   But before we get into the issue proper, it is important to clear away the standard objections, both why subject  A Song of Ice and Fire (and its spin-off properties) to critical analysis at all and also why, if we are going to do that, we are going to focus squarely in on the Dothraki. The answer to the first is something that we’ve rehearsed a number of times, but bears restating: for most of its readers (and the watchers of  A Game of Thrones),  A Song of Ice and Fire will be their primary exposure to the idea of the Middle Ages. This is particularly true because of the reputation that the series has for being ‘ how it really was,’ a reputation that George R.R. Martin has consciously cultivated (as with his classic complaint of  ‘what was Aragorn’s tax policy’ – there is a rich irony that, had Martin understood rulership in the Middle Ages better, he would have understood why Aragorn’s tax policy was less important). Martin has been quite open that he “ draw[s] inspiration from history” and that fact has long been a selling point of the series over more obviously fantastical kinds of medieval-themed high fantasy as well as a  response to some of the series’ more controversial moments.</p><p>   但是，在我们深入探讨这个问题之前，务必要消除标准的异议，这既是为什么要对《冰与火之歌》（及其附带的性质）进行彻底的批判分析，以及为什么要为此，我们将专注于Dothraki。第一个问题的答案是我们经过多次演练，但需要重申：对于大多数读者（和《权力的游戏》的观看者）来说，《冰与火之歌》将是他们对《冰与火之歌》的主要了解。中世纪的想法。尤其如此，因为该系列因其“真实的样子”而享有盛誉，是乔治·RR·马丁有意识地树立的声誉（就像他对“阿拉贡的税收政策是什么”的经典抱怨一样-颇具讽刺意味） （如果马丁更好地理解了中世纪的统治制度，他会理解为什么阿拉贡的税收政策不那么重要）。马丁很开放，他“从历史中汲取灵感”，而且事实一直是该系列的卖点，而这些产品显然是对以中世纪为主题的奇幻奇幻题材的高幻想以及对该系列某些作品的回应。更多有争议的时刻。</p><p> Naturally, that cloak of verisimilitude has tended to intensify the degree to which elements of  A Song of Ice and Fire is taken by its readers and viewers as representative of the Middle Ages more generally. And of course as I have noted in the (quite recent) past,   fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present. In the case of  A Song of Ice and Fire in particular, this vision of the past is  particularly worth interrogating because it serves as the basis for a  parable on power and violence.</p><p> 自然地，那种真实感的斗篷趋于增强了《冰与火之歌》的元素被读者和观众所接受的程度更普遍地代表了中世纪。当然，正如我在（相当近期）的过去所指出的那样，小说通常是公众如何对过去进行概念化，而过去的概念则决定着我们目前所做的决定。特别是在《冰与火之歌》的案例中，对过去的这种看法特别值得质疑，因为它是关于权力与暴力的寓言的基础。</p><p> But  even if it didn’t, it would still be worth discussing these aspects of the universe of  A Song of Ice and Fire, because that is what we are supposed to do with cultural products, with  literature.  I am sometimes baffled that the very fans who insist that their particular loves be treated seriously, as  art are the same fans who react with frustration if one then sets out to interrogate those same genres the way one would interrogate serious art or literature. This is it, after all! This is what you (we, really) wanted! A (quite unimpressive, I’ll grant you) ivory tower academic is taking this genre seriously and subjecting it to serious criticism! Isn’t that what emerging genres often hope for, to be taken seriously as ‘high’ literature?</p><p> 但是，即使不是这样，仍然值得讨论《冰与火之歌》的这些方面，因为我们应该将其与文化产品和文学联系在一起。我有时会感到困惑，那些坚持坚持认真对待自己的爱情的歌迷，因为艺术是同样的歌迷，如果他们开始以质疑严肃的艺术或文学的方式审问相同的流派，他们会感到沮丧。就是这样！这就是您（我们，真的）想要的！一位（很不令人印象深刻，我会同意的）象牙塔学者正在认真对待这一类型，并对其进行认真的批评！这不是新兴流派经常希望被视为“高级”文学的东西吗？</p><p> And of course we should take it seriously. And here I want to speak briefly to the purpose of these sorts of endeavors,  because the goal here is not to force anyone to dislike  A Song of Ice and Fire. We’re not here to ‘cancel’  ASOIF any more than we were going to ‘cancel’   AC:Valhalla two weeks ago (a game I continue to play, I might add). Instead, discussing cultural products like this is a form of inoculation against their potentially negative aspects, because once a reader knows that, for instance, the depiction of a given culture in a work of fiction has relatively little to do with any real world culture, they can compartmentalize that to the fiction itself;  it loses its power to mislead  and so may be enjoyed in safety, as it were. And there are good things in  A Song of Ice and Fire and in the first six or so seasons of  Game of Thrones; but we also need to be honest about the failings.</p><p> 当然，我们应该认真对待它。在这里，我想简单地谈一谈这些努力的目的，因为这里的目的不是要强迫任何人都不喜欢《冰与火之歌》。与两周前我们要取消AC：Valhalla相比，我们在这里尚无法“取消” ASOIF（我可能还会继续玩这款游戏）。相反，讨论这样的文化产品是一种针对其潜在负面影响的接种方式，因为一旦读者知道，例如，在小说作品中对特定文化的描绘与任何现实世界的文化都没有多大关系，他们可以将其与小说本身区分开；它会失去误导的力量，因此可能会像以前一样在安全方面享有享受。在《冰与火之歌》和《权力的游戏》的前六个赛季中，都有好事。但是我们也必须对失败诚实。</p><p> (Of course, more broadly, doing this as a practice exercise is a key part of building up that skill – what we may term ‘critical reading’ – more generally, rendering the alert reader more resistant to this sort of thing, both in its unintended form (as, I suspect, in this case) or in its more dangerous  intended form. Put another way, developing critical reading skills is one important way to make one’s self a harder target for misinformation, including historical misinformation.)</p><p> （当然，从更广泛的意义上讲，将其作为练习练习是建立该技能的关键部分，我们可以将其称为“批判性阅读”，更广泛地说，这是使警报阅读器在这种情况下更加抵制这种情况意外的形式（例如，我怀疑是这种情况）或更危险的预期形式。换句话说，发展批判性阅读技能是使自己成为更难获得错误信息（包括历史错误信息）目标的一种重要方法。</p><p>  Alright, so  A Song of Ice and Fire is worth looking at closely. So why  this part of the fiction? It comes down to something  George R.R. Martin wrote:</p><p>  好吧，因此《冰与火之歌》值得一看。那么，为什么这部分小说呢？归结为George R.R. Martin写道： </p><p> The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p><p>Dothraki实际上是多种草原和平原文化的混合物……当然，蒙古人和匈奴人，还有Alans，Sioux，Cheyenne和其他美洲印第安人部落……充满了纯粹的幻想。</p><p> In many aspects of the world of Westeros, Martin has  implied that he is presenting a more historically grounded setting. But this is the case where he most directly  stated that, a point that is presented – without comment – on  both  wikis and thus seems to reflect the general consensus about this fictional culture. In short,  Martin claims, and it appears generally accepted by his fans, that the Dothraki represent an amalgam of   historical  horse nomads, with only a ‘dash’ of pure fantasy. There is, on this point, no hiding behind the fantastic nature of the setting, or the conventions of the genre, instead  the claim to historicity is made baldly,  and that deserves investigation.</p><p> 在维斯特洛世界的许多方面，马丁暗示他所呈现的是一个更具历史意义的背景。但是，在这种情况下，他最直接地指出，在两个Wiki上都表达了这一点-不加评论，因此似乎反映了对这种虚构文化的普遍共识。简而言之，马丁声称，他的歌迷似乎已经被他的粉丝们普遍接受，它代表着历史悠久的马游牧民族的混合体，只有一点点纯粹的幻想。在这一点上，没有隐藏在场景的奇妙性质或流派惯例背后的事实，相反，对历史性的主张是光秃秃的，值得研究。</p><p> (Of course there is the cover that thereis a ‘dash’ of pure fantasy – that is why this is going to be a rather comprehensive look. If we just discussed this or that aspect, one might well claim “ah, but there is the dash of fantasy.” But at the same time, a ‘dash’ only goes so far; if I ask you to add a ‘dash’ of pepper to a recipe and the end product comes back 51% pepper by mass, we need not debate semantics to understand that something has gone really rather wrong.)</p><p> （当然，封面上有一个纯粹的幻想“破折号”-这就是为什么它将是一个相当全面的外观。如果我们只是讨论了这个或那个方面，可能会声称“啊，但有但是，与此同时，“破折号”只能走这么远；如果我要您在配方中添加“破折号”的胡椒粉，而最终产品返回的胡椒粉质量为51％，我们不需要对语义进行辩论，以了解某些地方确实出了点问题。）</p><p> Now how are we to assess that? Because Martin has claimed that this fantasy culture is an amalgam of two  different cultural groups, we cannot simply compare it to one or the other in isolation, because it might be reasonably argued that any aspect of the culture that didn’t fit our model simply came from the other group. So instead,  we are going to move through the depiction of the Dothraki, comparing them at each stage to  both Steppe Nomads and plains Native American cultures in order to try to detect the possible roots of the elements of Dothraki culture or their absence.</p><p> 现在我们如何评估呢？因为马丁声称这种幻想文化是两种不同文化群体的结合体，所以我们不能简单地将其与一种或另一种文化进行比较，因为有理由认为，该文化的任何方面都不适合我们的模型来自另一组。因此，相反，我们将遍历Dothraki的描绘，将它们在每个阶段与草原游牧民族和平原美洲原住民文化进行比较，以尝试发现Dothraki文化元素的可能根源或它们的缺失。</p><p> Because – and this is going to surprise literally no one who reads this blog – that claim to historicity is fundamentally empty.  The Dothraki are not an amalgam of Steppe and Plains cultures, they are an amalgam of stereotypes  about Steppe and Plains cultures. There it is, that is the thesis for the next three to four weeks of the blog! All of the angry hurt-fan-commenters can just go shout angrily into the void of comment moderation right now.</p><p> 因为–从字面上看，没有哪个人会读过此博客-声称历史性根本上是空的。 Dothraki不是草原和平原文化的混合物，它们是关于草原和平原文化的刻板印象的混合物。就是了，这是博客接下来三到四个星期的论文！所有愤怒的受伤粉丝评论者现在都可以愤怒地大喊大叫，以免评论温和。</p><p>    The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts” ( AGoT, 83).</p><p>    骑马者在参观自由城市时可能会穿上丰富的面料和甜美的香水，但在开阔的天空下，他们却保留了旧的方式。男人和女人都穿着裸露的胸部涂漆的皮革背心，铜质纪念章皮带束缚着马毛绑腿”（AGoT，83）。</p><p> Now as details go, that’s not a lot, but it is the clearest description of Dothraki clothing that I can find (there’s an echo of it in  AGoT, 329; the same patterns made for Viserys, but out of linen). But we’re given some context to interpret that description in the passage that surrounds it, the event has “barbaric splendor” ( AGoT, 82; this is a statement, I should note, delivered by the narrator, not a thought of Daenerys’), the people a “seething sea of Dothraki” ( AGoT 83) who “gorged themselves” and “drank themselves blind” and “spat jests” ( AGoT, 84). We’ll return to this wedding scene next week in some detail, but it is hard to avoid that we are supposed to read the Dothraki leathers as ‘barbaric,’ rough and somewhat wild compared to the fine silks, linens and wools they are often described against.</p><p> 现在，细节就不多了，但这是我能找到的最清晰的Dothraki服装描述（在AGoT，329中有相似之处；与Viserys相同的图案，但亚麻制）。但是我们得到了一些上下文来解释围绕它的段落中的描述，该事件具有“野蛮的光彩”（AGoT，82岁；我应该指出，这是一个由叙述者发表的声明，而不是丹妮莉丝的想法），人们就是“沸腾的多拉斯基海”（AGoT，83岁），他们“自食其力”，“盲目饮酒”和“开玩笑”（AGoT，84岁）。下周我们将详细介绍这个婚礼现场，但是很难避免我们应该将Dothraki皮革读作“野蛮的”，与通常使用的细丝，亚麻和羊毛相比，粗糙且有些百搭描述反对。 </p><p> And of course, that is  exactly how the show has opted to read Dothraki clothing:</p><p>当然，这正是该节目选择阅读Dothraki服装的方式：</p><p>  And I should note, not only the show, but also the tie-in products, like the trading card illustrations ( which the book wiki uses to the exclusion of the show, I assume because they are thought to be more accurate to Martin’s vision):</p><p>  而且我应该注意，不仅是演出，而且还有配套产品，例如交易卡插图（本书Wiki排除了演出所使用的插图，我认为是因为它们被认为更符合Martin的设想） ：</p><p>  And when they are exposed to the cold climates of Westeros (we’ll come back to this point in a moment) they supplement the leather-strap-gear with lots of rough fur pelts:</p><p>  当他们暴露于韦斯特罗斯（Westeros）的寒冷气候时（我们稍后会回到这一点），他们在皮革皮带上补充了许多粗糙的毛皮：</p><p>  What I think unites these interpretations is in all cases we are to understand that this is an unsophisticated, barbaric form of dress for what are represented as relatively unsophisticated people: rough, unprocessed, inelegant and brutally functional. It is, in short,  very Fremen. And I want to be clear that I think this is absolutely what is intended; we will, in a moment, treat Martin’s words  much more charitably than they probably deserve. But we should be clear  that the straight-line reading of Martin’s words is  exactly the form of clothing we see in the show. Again, the contrast between the “rich fabrics” and Dothraki clothing in its “barbaric splendor” is  explicit in the text ( AGoT 82-3).</p><p>  我认为将这些解释结合起来的意思是，在所有情况下，我们都应该理解这是一种相对简单的，野蛮的衣服形式，代表着相对简单的人们：粗糙，未经加工，优雅且残酷的功能。简而言之，这是非常弗雷曼。我想明确一点，我认为这绝对是我们的预期。一会儿，我们将对马丁的话语给予应有的慈善对待。但我们应该清楚，马丁的话语的直线阅读正是我们在演出中看到的服装形式。同样，在文本中（AGoT 82-3），“丰富的面料”和Dothraki服装在“野蛮的光彩”之间的对比也很明显。</p><p>   First, let’s talk about  materials. We can rule out a Steppe Nomad inspiration for any of this right off. The Eurasian Steppe is very large and covers a range of arid climates (that is to say, parts of it are colder, parts of it are warmer), but they all have  spinning and  weaving  technology, by which the supple hairs of woolly animals, or plant fibers like linen, or cotton, or even natural protein fibers like silk can be fashioned into fabric which is more flexible, comfortable, breathable and temperature controlled than the raw leather we see in the show. To the surprise of no one, they used that:</p><p>   首先，让我们谈谈材料。我们可以立即排除草原游牧民族的灵感。欧亚草原非常大，涵盖了一系列干旱气候（也就是说，部分地区较冷，部分地区较暖），但是它们都具有纺纱和编织技术，通过这种技术，羊毛动物的柔软毛发，或诸如亚麻之类的植物纤维或棉，甚至诸如蚕丝之类的天然蛋白质纤维，都可以制成比我们在展会上看到的原皮革更加柔软，舒适，透气和温度受控的织物。令所有人惊讶的是，他们使用了：</p><p>  You will note that there is a distinct lack here of lots of  leather, except in the sort of things that lots of cultures use leather for (boots, fittings, saddles, bags, tents). Instead, clothing is mostly made out of nice, comfortable, breathable textiles, because of course it is. That is not to say, to be clear, that leather or hides or fur were  never used – fur especially was used; merely that they were generally used to supplement clothing primarily made out of textile. Also, please note all of the animals in the background there. We’ll come back to them next week.</p><p>  您会注意到这里明显缺少皮革，除了许多文化使用皮革的东西（靴子，配件，马鞍，包，帐篷）。取而代之的是，衣物通常是由美观，舒适，透气的纺织品制成的，因为它确实如此。显然，这并不是说从未使用过皮革，皮革或毛皮，尤其是使用了毛皮；只是它们通常用于补充主要由纺织品制成的衣服。另外，请注意背景中的所有动物。我们下周再来找他们。</p><p> Now Plains Native American clothing does make much greater use of animal skin as a clothing material, but there is an important distinction to be made here. The problem here is with the plasticity of the term ‘leather’ which can  technically include a wide range of products, but in practice is understood to mean  exactly what the  Game of Thrones costume department and literally every piece of official artwork of the Dothraki understand it to mean, which is the product of tanning processes. I am not an expert, but as far as I can tell, Native American clothing was not made in the same way; animal products were used in a process I have seen described as ‘brain tanning’ (rather than using chemical tannins) and the final product was then smoked. The result – which is often called ‘buckskin’ regardless of the animal source for the hide – is  very different from the leather we see in the show:</p><p> 现在，美国原住民平原的服装确实大量使用了动物皮肤作为服装材料，但是这里有一个重要的区别。这里的问题是“皮革”一词的可塑性，从技术上讲它可以包括各种各样的产品，但实际上应该理解为“权力的游戏”服装部门以及Dothraki的每件官方艺术品的确切含义。是指鞣制过程的产物。我不是专家，但据我所知，美洲印第安人的服装并非以相同的方式制造。我见过将动物产品用于“大脑鞣制”过程（而不是使用化学单宁），然后将最终产品熏制。结果（无论皮革的动物来源如何，通常都称为“鹿皮”）与我们在展会上看到的皮革有很大不同： </p><p>  This is, in terms of material, very clearly  not what the ‘vests’ the Dothraki in the show are wearing. Buckskin would also be used to make trousers, as opposed to the “horsehair leggings” of Martin’s wording, which also strike me as  deeply improbably. Haircloth – fabric made from horsehair (or camel hair) – is durable, but typically stiff, unsupple and terribly itchy; not something you want in direct contact with your skin (especially not between your rear end and a saddle), unless you just really like skin irritation. It is also a difficult material to get in any kind of significant quantity – and you would need a significant quantity if you intended to make most of your trousers out of it.</p><p>就材料而言，这显然不是节目中Dothraki的“背心”穿着的东西。鹿皮还可以用来做裤子，这与马丁的措词“马鬃绑腿”相反，后者也使我深深地感到不可能。毛布-由马毛（或骆驼毛）制成的织物-坚固耐用，但通常会僵硬，不柔软且发痒。除非您真的很喜欢皮肤刺激，否则不要将其直接与皮肤接触（特别是不要在后端和鞍座之间）。这也是一种很难获得大量数量的材料–如果您打算从中使用大部分裤子，则需要大量。</p><p> So the book materials are either 100% or 50% wrong on materials, depending on how far we let Martin stretch the word ‘leather,’ while the film depiction is just wrong on all the merits regardless.  Well that’s for materials, what about patterns?</p><p> 因此，这本书的材料在材料上是100％还是50％是错误的，具体取决于我们让Martin拉伸“皮革”一词的程度，而无论如何，电影描写都是错误的。好吧，那是材料，图案呢？</p><p>  Once again, we can quite easily rule out anything steppe inspired. Again, the Eurasian Steppe is big and has lots of variety, but relatively long robes are generally the norm in terms of dress; where long robes were not worn (see our Scythian above), the common pattern was heavy sleeved garments and trousers with very complete coverage. A common example of the type of long robe-like garments is the Mongolian   deel, a long sleeved robe or tunic which provides a lot of protection against the elements. In the case of elites – and Daenerys is, initially, mostly around elites – these could be made of expensive silk or brocade – but poorer versions might be made of wool.</p><p>  再一次，我们可以很容易地排除任何草原灵感。同样，欧亚草原很大，种类繁多，但长袍通常是穿着的常态。在没有穿长袍的地方（请参见上面的Scythian），常见的样式是厚袖的衣服和长裤，覆盖范围很广。长袍状服装类型的一个常见示例是蒙古de，这是一种长袖袍或束腰外衣，可为各种元素提供大量保护。就精英而言-丹妮莉丝起初主要是围绕精英-可以用昂贵的丝绸或锦缎制成-但较差的版本可能由羊毛制成。</p><p> (Note if you want to go further back historically and look at the dress of western Eurasian steppe nomads in the Roman period, take a look at M. Gleba, C. Munkholt and M-L Nosch,   Dressing the Past (2008), which has discussions and reconstructions of both Scythian and Sarmatian clothing and the sort of evidence that effort is based on. Much like Mongolian clothing shown above, both Scythian and Sarmatian clothing is ‘high coverage’ for the same reasons discussed below.)</p><p> （请注意，如果您想进一步追溯历史，看看罗马时期西方欧亚草原游牧民族的穿着，请看看M. Gleba，C。Munkholt和ML Nosch，《打扮过去》（2008年），其中进行了讨论以及Scythian和Sarmatian服装的重建以及基于努力的证据。与上述蒙古服装非常相似，Scythian和Sarmatian服装都是“高覆盖率”，原因如下所述。）</p><p>  And there is good reason for these relatively high-coverage garments. Plains or Steppe peoples naturally tend to live on, well,  plains and steppes – that is large expanses of semi-arid grasslands. The very nature of that  terrain  configuration produces fairly extreme seasonal temperature variations (that is, very hot summers and very cold winters) as well as extreme  daily temperature variations (that is, hot days and cold nights) because such places are far from the large bodies of water and also don’t have tree-cover, both of which serve to moderate rapid temperature changes. Consequently, as anyone who has lived in a plains state in the USA (or on the Eurasian Steppe, though that is fewer of my readers, but for my brave handful of hits from that part of the world, hello and welcome!) can tell you, you need clothes that can be layered and which can be both warm in the winter and cool in the summer. For us moderns, we mostly do this by owning multiple season-specific wardrobes, but clothing is expensive in pre-modern societies, so multi-purpose garments, or garments that be layered, to turn a warm-weather outfit into a cold-weather outfit are important!</p><p>  这些覆盖率较高的服装有充分的理由。平原或草原人民自然倾向于生活在平原和草原上，那是大片半干旱的草原。该地形配置的本质是产生相当极端的季节性温度变化（即非常炎热的夏季和非常寒冷的冬天）以及极端的每日温度变化（即炎热的白天和寒冷的夜晚），因为这些地方远离大范围水体也没有树木遮盖物，这两者都可以缓解温和的快速温度变化。因此，就像住在美国平原州（或欧亚草原）的任何人一样，尽管我的读者人数较少，但是对于我来自世界那部分地区的几本热门小说，您好，欢迎光临！您需要的是可以分层的衣服，冬天既要保暖，夏天又要凉爽。对于我们现代人来说，我们通常是通过拥有多个按季节分类的衣柜来做到这一点的，但是在前现代社会，服装价格昂贵，因此，多用途服装或分层服装会使温暖的衣服变成寒冷的衣服。衣服很重要！</p><p> There’s no reason to suppose the  Dothraki Sea would be any different: it sits at about the same latitude as King’s Landing so there is little reason to assume it would be warm all-year-round. Parts of the Eurasian Steppe stretch decently far south, sharing a latitude with northern Italy and Spain; nevertheless they do not enjoy the same Mediterranean climate because they don’t have the same exposure to the weather patterns created by the sea. The southern end of the Great Plains stretches down all the way into Texas, but still gets properly cold in the winter with  temperatures regularly dipping below freezing in the winter despite the latitude. For a people who are camping and working outside all of the time, warm clothing is going to be a must.</p><p> 没有理由认为Dothraki海会有所不同：它的纬度与国王的登陆岛处于相同的纬度，因此没有理由认为它全年都会温暖。欧亚草原的部分地区向南延伸，与意大利北部和西班牙共享纬度。不过，由于它们对海洋造成的天气模式的暴露程度不同，因此他们无法享受相同的地中海气候。大平原的南端一直延伸到得克萨斯州，但在冬季，尽管纬度较高，但冬季仍会适当变冷，冬季的温度经常会降至零度以下。对于一直在外面露营和工作的人来说，保暖衣服是必须的。</p><p> (Now, of course adherents to the  Fremen Mirage will want to treat this as just civilized weakness and assume that more</p><p> （现在，Fremen Mirage的拥护者当然希望将其视为文明的弱点，并假设 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/蛮族/">#蛮族</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/horde/">#horde</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dothraki/">#dothraki</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
