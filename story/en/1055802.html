He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out discordant beeping electronic jingles. He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does nothing less than place the entire telephone system of the world, satellites, cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge.</p><p>我在Al Gilbertson *，“蓝色框”的造物主中提供的便携式客厅。吉尔伯顿正在手掌掌握着他的闪亮的黑色和银色的“蓝色盒子”，指出了从控制台上伸出的十三个小红色推动按钮。他在按钮上跳舞手指，点击不讨而不容的令人愉快的令人愉快的令人鼓舞的电子叮当声。他正试图向我解释他的小蓝盒子如何不仅仅是将世界整个电话系统放置在蓝箱操作员的全球电话系统，卫星，电缆和所有人，免费。</p><p> “That’s what it does. Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator. You seize a tandem with this top button,” he presses the top button with his index finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, “and like that”—cheep goes the blue box again—“you control the phone company’s long-distance switching systems from your cute little Princess phone or any old pay phone. And you’ve got anonymity. An operator has to operate from a definite location: the phone company knows where she is and what she’s doing. But with your beeper box, once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 [tollfree] number, they don’t know where you are, or where you’re coming from, they don’t know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number. They don’t even know anything illegal is going on. And you can obscure your origins through as many levels as you like. You can call next door by way of White Plains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and then back here by satellite. You can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay phone next to you. And you get your dime back too.”</p><p> “这就是它的所作所为。基本上它为您提供了超级操作员的力量。你用这个顶部按钮抓住串联，“他用食指按下顶部按钮，蓝色盒子发出高音吱吱声，”像那个“-Cheep再次出现蓝色盒子”你控制手机公司的长期 - 从可爱的小公主手机或任何旧的薪酬电话的切换系统。你有匿名的。运营商必须从明确的位置运营：手机公司知道她在哪里以及她在做什么。但是用你的哔哔声，一旦你跳上一个行李箱，从假日酒店800【Tollfree]号码，他们不知道你在哪里，或者你来自哪里，他们不知道你是如何滑翔的他们的线条并在800号码中弹出。他们甚至不知道任何违法行为。你可以根据你喜欢的级别掩盖你的起源。你可以通过白皮的方式打电话，然后通过电缆转到利物浦，然后通过卫星回来。您可以将自己从一个手机拨打到世界各地的手机到您旁边的付费电话。你也得到了一毛钱。“</p><p> “And they can’t trace the calls? They can’t charge you?”</p><p> “他们无法追踪电话？他们不能向你收费？“</p><p> “Not if you do it the right way. But you’ll find that the free-call thing isn’t really as exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having one of these babies in your hand. I’ve watched people when they first get hold of one of these things and start using it, and discover they can make connections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and forth across the world. They hardly talk to the people they finally reach. They say hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next. They go a little crazy.” He looks down at the neat little package in his palm. His fingers are still dancing, tapping out beeper patterns.</p><p> “如果你这样做，不是正确的方式。但是，你会发现自由呼叫的事情并不像你手里拥有其中一个婴儿所获得的权力的感觉一样令人兴奋。当他们第一次掌握其中一个并开始使用它并发现他们可以建立连接，在世界上来回来建立连接。他们几乎没有与他们终于到达的人交谈。他们说你好，开始考虑下一个呼叫。他们有点疯狂。“他俯视着他掌上整齐的小包裹。他的手指还在跳舞，挖出蜂鸣器的模式。</p><p> “I think it’s something to do with how small my models are. There are lots of blue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most sophisticated electronically. I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big syndicate order.”</p><p> “我认为这与我的模型有多少钱有关。周围有很多蓝色框，但我的是电子是最小，最复杂的电子。我希望我能告诉你我们为我们的大型唱结订单制作的原型。“</p><p> He sighs. “We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate front man in Las Vegas. They use them to place bets coast to coast, keep lines open for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay. The deal was a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. Before then we retailed them for $1,500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down. We had a manufacturing deal worked out in the Philippines. Everything ready to go. Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to fit inside a flip-top Marlboro box. It had flush-touch panels for a keyboard, rather than these unsightly buttons sticking out. Looked just like a tiny portable radio. In fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to get one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch on the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anything illegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model—I had it lined with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny button transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes instantly in case of a bust. It was beautiful. A beautiful little machine. You should have seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came back after trying it out. They’d hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, and they’d say, I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it.’  You probably won’t believe it until you try it.”</p><p> 他叹了一口气。 “我们在拉斯维加斯的一个唱片前男子的一千个蜂鸣器箱中有这个命令。他们用它们将赌注海岸放在海岸，保持线路开放时间，所有这些都可以支付昂贵。这笔交易是一千张蓝色盒子，每股300美元。在那之前，我们以1500美元的价格零售，但一次肿块300,000美元很难拒绝。我们在菲律宾进行了一项制造业。一切都准备好了。无论如何，我已经准备好的批量生产的模型足够小，以适应一个翻页的万宝路箱。它有一个键盘的冲洗面板，而不是伸出的这些难看的按钮。看起来就像一个小型便携式收音机。事实上，我设计了一个微小的晶体管接收器来获得一个AM频道，所以如果法律变得可疑，所有者可以打开无线电部分，开始抓住他的手指，没有人可以判断任何非法发生的事情。我想到了这个模型的一切 - 我的一切都衬有一条热量，可以通过腰带上的微小按钮发射器通过无线电信号点燃，所以可以在胸围的情况下立即燃烧到灰烬。它过去挺美。一台漂亮的小机器。在尝试之后，你应该在这些辛迪加人上看到面孔。他们就像他们从不想要放手一样掌握它，他们说，我无法相信它。我无法相信它。“在你尝试之前，你可能不会相信它。”</p><p>   About eleven o’clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right. He is standing inside a phone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1. I am standing outside the phone booth.</p><p>   大约十一点两晚，后来Fraser Lucey在他的左手掌中有一个蓝色的盒子，在他的右手掌上手机。他站在一个孤立的关闭汽车旅馆旁边的一个电话亭里面，距离公路1旁边。我站在电话外面。 </p><p> Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people. Until a few weeks ago when Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey liked to bring his blue box** to parties. It never failed: a few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the very hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for hours. He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico. He became a dealer.</p><p>弗雷泽喜欢炫耀他的蓝色盒子。直到几周前，太平洋电话在他的城市逮捕了一些逮捕时，弗雷泽·卢迪耶喜欢将他的蓝色框**带到派对上。它永远不会失败：从他的设备和弗雷泽的一些吱吱声成为了在Hippest聚会上的关注的中心，玩电话技巧并完成时间的要求。他开始在墨西哥的制造商接受订单。他成了经销商。</p><p> Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box. But he never gets tired of playing with it. “It’s like the first time every time,” he tells me.</p><p> 弗雷泽现在是谨慎的，他在哪里炫耀他的蓝色盒子。但他永远不会厌倦玩它。 “这就像每次第一次一样，”他告诉我。</p><p> Fraser puts a dime in the slot. He listens for a tone and holds the receiver up to my ear. I hear the tone.</p><p> 弗雷泽在插槽中放置了一毛钱。他倾听了一个语气，并将接收器保持在我耳边。我听到了语气。</p><p> Fraser begins describing, with a certain practiced air, what he does while he does it.</p><p> 弗雷泽开始描述，有一定的练习空气，他在他做的时候他做了什么。</p><p> “I’m dialing an 800 number now. Any 800 number will do. It’s toll free. Tonight I think I’ll use the —– [he names a well-known rent-a-car company] 800 number. Listen. It’s ringing. Here, you hear it? Now watch.”</p><p> “我现在正在拨到800号码。任何800号码都将是。这是免费的。今晚我想我会使用 -  [他命名着一个着名的租金 - 汽车公司] 800号码。听。它的响声。在这里，你听到了吗？现在看。“</p><p> He places the blue box over the mouthpiece of the phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward me. He presses the silver button—the one at the top—and I hear that high-pitched beep.</p><p> 他将蓝色盒子放在手机的喉舌上，使一个银和十二个黑色按钮面临着我。他按下银色按钮 - 顶部的一个人 - 我听到高级哔哔声。</p><p> “That’s 2600 cycles per second to be exact,” says Lucey. “Now, quick, listen.”</p><p> “这是每秒2600个周期来确切，”Lucey说。 “现在，快，听。” </p><p> He shoves the earpiece at me. The ringing has vanished. The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing but soft white noise.</p><p>他把耳机推到我身上。振铃消失了。这条线路略有封闭，有一个尖锐的嗡嗡声，而且没有柔软的白噪声。</p><p> “We’re home free now,” Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying the blue box to its mouthpiece once again. “We’re up on a tandem, into a long-lines trunk. Once you’re up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhere you want to go.” He decides to check out London first. He chooses a certain pay phone located in Waterloo Station. This particular pay phone is popular with the phone-phreaks network because there are usually people walking by at all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.</p><p> “我们现在自由了，”姑娘告诉我，收回手机并再次将蓝色盒子涂抹在喉舌。 “我们在串联上，进入一个长线的行李箱。一旦你在串联上，你可以在任何你想去的地方发送自己。“他决定先查看伦敦。他选择了一个位于滑铁卢站的一台薪酬电话。这种特殊的薪酬电话与电话关键网球接受流行，因为通常有些人在所有时间都在走路，谁会拿起一段时间。</p><p> He presses the lower left-hand corner button which is marked “KP” on the face of the box.</p><p> 他按下左下角的左下角按钮，在盒子的脸上标记为“kp”。</p><p> The phone company let some technical journal publish the frequencies used to create their tones. It took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first blue box.</p><p> 电话公司让一些技术期刊发布用于创建他们的音调的频率。从我看到这篇文章放在一起的第一个蓝盒时，它可能需要12个小时。</p><p> “That’s Key Pulse. It tells the tandem we’re ready to give it instructions. First I’ll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into the overseas sender in White Plains.” I hear a neat clunk-cheep. “I think we’ll head over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connection is somewhat better, but I like going by satellite. So I just punch out KP Zero 44. The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the country code for England. Okay…we’re there. In Liverpool actually. Now all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up the pay phone. Here, listen, I’ve got a ring now.”</p><p> “那是关键脉搏。它讲述了我们准备好给它指令的串联。首先，我将打出KP 182开始，这将使我们滑入白皮中的海外发件人。“我听到了一个整洁的笨蛋。 “我认为我们将通过卫星前往英格兰。电缆实际上是更快的，连接有点更好，但我喜欢卫星去。所以我只是打出kp零44.零应该保证卫星连接，44是英格兰的国家代码。好的......我们在那里。在利物浦实际上。现在我所要做的就是打出伦敦区代码，是1，并拨打付费电话。在这里，听，我现在有一个戒指。“</p><p> I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring. Then someone picks up the phone. “Hello,” says the London voice.</p><p> 我听到了伦敦戒指的软快速私人。然后有人拿起电话。 “你好，”伦敦的声音说。</p><p>  “Hello. There’s actually nobody here. I just picked this up while I was passing by. This is a public phone. There’s no one here to answer actually.”</p><p>  “你好。这里实际上没有人。我在经过的时候刚刚拿到了这件事。这是一部公用电话。这里没有人回答。“ </p><p> “Hello. Don’t hang up. I’m calling from the United States.”</p><p>“你好。不要挂断电话。我从美国呼唤。“</p><p> “Oh. What is the purpose of the call? This is a public phone you know.”</p><p> “哦。电话的目的是什么？这是一个你知道的公用电话。“</p><p> “Oh. You know. To check out, uh, to find out what’s going on in London. How is it there?”</p><p> “哦。你知道。要退房，呃，找出伦敦发生了什么。那边如何？”</p><p> “It’s five o’clock in the morning. It’s raining now.”</p><p> “早上五点钟。现在正在下雨。“</p><p>  The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the base in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-six-hour pass. He and Fraser talk about the rain. They agree that it’s nicer when it’s not raining. They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up. His dime returns with a nice clink.</p><p>  伦敦路人成为一个r.a.f.在林肯郡回到基地的道路上，在三十六小时的通行证后，宿舍。他和弗雷泽谈到了雨。他们同意，当它没有下雨时，它就会更好。他们说再见，弗雷泽挂了起来。他的角钱回归了一个很好的眨眼。</p><p> “Isn’t that far  out,” he says grinning at me. “London. Like that.”</p><p> “这不是很遥，”他说咧着嘴笑。 “伦敦。像那样。”</p><p> Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm. “I told ya this thing is for real. Listen, if you don’t mind I’m gonna try this girl I know in Paris. I usually give her a call around this time. It freaks her out. This time I’ll use the —– (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number and we’ll go by overseas cable, 133 ; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sends you by cable. Okay, here we go….Oh damn. Busy. Who could she be talking to at this time?”</p><p> 弗雷泽在他的手掌中深情地挤压了小蓝盒子。 “我告诉你这件事是真实的。听，如果你不介意，我会试试这个女孩，我知道在巴黎。我通常会在这个时候给她一个电话。它吓坏了她。这次我将使用 - （一个不同的租盘汽车公司）800号码，我们将通过海外电缆，133; 33是法国的国家代码，1通过电缆发送您。好的，我们走了......该死的。忙碌的。她此时可以和谁交谈？“ </p><p> A state police car cruises slowly by the motel. The car does not stop, but Fraser gets nervous. We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in the opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night. We pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes inside and tries the Paris number. It is busy again.</p><p>州警车慢慢地由汽车旅馆巡航。汽车不会停止，但弗雷泽很紧张。我们跳回他的车并在相反的方向上驾驶十英里，直到我们到达一个坦克站夜间锁定。我们通过轮胎泵拉到电话展位。弗雷泽里面的弗雷泽划线，并试图了巴黎号码。它再次忙碌。</p><p> “I don’t understand who she could be talking to. The circuits may be busy. It’s too bad I haven’t learned how to tap into lines overseas with this thing yet.”</p><p> “我不明白她可以和谁说话。电路可能很忙。太糟糕了，我还没有学会如何用这件事挖掘海外的行。“</p><p> Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say. He dials a leading nationwide charge card’s 800 number and punches out the tones that bring him the Time recording in Sydney, Australia. He beeps up the Weather recording in Rome, in Italian of course. He calls a friend in Boston and talks about a certain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily. He finds the Paris number busy again. He calls up “Dial a Disc” in London, and we listen to  Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week in London. He calls up a dealer of another sort and talks in code. He calls up Joe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects. There are other calls. Finally Fraser gets through to his young lady in Paris. They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paris telephone system. At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, pockets his dime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his “lovely little blue box” in the other.</p><p> 弗雷泽开始关键，正如手机的关键词所说的那样。他拨打了一个领先的全国性的充电卡的800号码，并掌握了带他在澳大利亚悉尼录制的音调。当然，他在意大利语中发出了罗马的天气录音。他叫波士顿的朋友，谈论他们陷入困境的某个柜台。他再次发现巴黎号码。他在伦敦打电话给“拨打光盘”，我们通过David和Ansil Collins聆听双桶，这是伦敦一周的一周。他在代码中呼唤另一个排序和谈话的经销商。他呼唤Joe Engressia，原来的盲人电话 -  Phreak Genius，并尊重他的尊重。还有其他电话。弗雷泽终于乘坐了巴黎的小姐。他们都同意电路一定是忙碌，并批评巴黎电话系统。弗雷泽的两点三十岁时挂了他的角钱，然后用一只手转向，拿着他召唤他的“可爱小蓝盒”的东西。</p><p>   “You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake,” Gilbertson explains two days later in his apartment. “They were careless enough to let some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their multi-frequency tones. Just a theoretical article some Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tones in passing. At —– [a well-known technical school] I had been fooling around with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the engineering library. I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box. It was bigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked.”</p><p>   “你看，几年前，电话公司发出了一个大错，”吉尔伯森在他的公寓后两天解释了两天。 “他们足以让一些技术期刊发布用于创建所有多频音的实际频率。只是一个理论上的文章，一些钟电话实验室工程师正在做切换理论，他在通过时列出了音调。在[一个着名的技术学校]我在遇到了工程图书馆的期刊副本之前，我一直在欺骗电话。我回到了实验室，从我看到这篇文章把第一个工作蓝盒子放在一起的时候可能需要十二小时。它比这个小宝宝更大，笨拙，但它的工作。“</p><p> It’s all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers. Or at least it was public. “Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now. Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation,” Gilbertson tells me.</p><p> 这是在该技术期刊上撰写的公共纪录，主要由贝尔实验室人为其他电话工程师撰写。或者至少是公开的。 “只需尝试在某些工程学学校图书馆就获得该问题的副本。贝尔已经让他们所有红标标签和撤出了流通，“Gilbertson告诉我。</p><p> “But it’s too late. It’s all public now. And once they became public the technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of any twelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old  blind kid as a matter of fact. And he can do it in  less than the twelve hours it took us. Blind kids do it all the time. They can’t build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, but theirs can do anything mine can do.”</p><p> “但为时已晚。现在就是公开的。一旦他们成为公众创造自己的蜂鸣器设备所需的技术就在任何十二岁的孩子的范围内，任何十二岁的盲人孩子就是事实。他可以在不到12个小时内完成它。盲目的孩子一直这样做。他们不能像我的蜂鸣声那样建造任何精确和紧凑的东西，但他们的东西可以做任何事情可以做到的事情。“</p><p>  “Okay. About twenty years ago A.T.&amp;T. made a multibillion-dollar decision to operate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve electronically generated combinations of six master tones. Those are the tones you sometimes hear in the background after you’ve dialed a long-distance number. They decided to use some very simple tones—the tone for each number is just two fixed single-frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beat frequency. Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played together give you the tone for digit 5. Now, what some of these phone phreaks have done is get themselves access to an electric organ. Any cheap family home-entertainment organ. Since the frequencies are public knowledge now—one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of those talking books for the blind—they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which correspond to the phone tones. Then they tape them. For instance, to get Ma Bell’s tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys F-5 and A-5 [900 and 700 cycles per second] at the same time. To produce the tone for 2 it’s F-5 and C-6 (i [1100 and 700 c.p.s]. The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of notes so there’s no trial and error anymore.”</p><p>  “好的。大约二十年前A.T.＆amp; t。在十二个电子产生的六个主音调的组合上运行其整个长距离交换系统的多金米路决定。在拨打长距离数后，这些是您有时在后台中听到的音调。他们决定使用一些非常简单的音调 - 每个数字的音调只是两个固定的单频音调，同时播放，以创建一定的节拍频率。如每秒1300个周期，每秒900个周期一起播放给你数字5的音调。现在，一些这些手机的关键词已经完成了什么可以访问电风箱。任何便宜的家庭家庭娱乐器官。由于频率是公众知识，现在一只盲人手机关键词甚至让他们记录在其中一个谈话的书籍中为盲目的书籍 - 他们只需要找到对应于电话音调的器官的音符。然后他们把它们留给它们。例如，要获得第1号的MA Bell的音调，请同时按下器官键F-5和A-5 [900和700周期]。为了产生2，它是2 IT的F-5和C-6（I [1100和700 C.p.s]。手机短暂的备注列表，所以不再有试验和错误。“ </p><p> He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ keys that produce them.</p><p>他向我展示了一份电话号码的其余部分和产生它们的两个电风琴钥匙。</p><p> “Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches-per-second tape speed and double it to 7 1/2 inches-per-second when you play them back, to get the proper tones,” he adds.</p><p> “实际上，你必须在3 3/4英寸的每秒录音速度录制这些音符，并在播放它们时向7 1/2英寸的每秒进行双倍，以获得适当的音调，”他补充道。</p><p> “So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phone system?”</p><p> “所以一旦你记录了所有音调，你如何将它们插入电话系统？”</p><p> “Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging out entire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country codes, routing instructions, ‘KP’ and ‘Start’ tones. Or, if they don’t have an organ, someone in the phone-phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded, with a voice saying ‘Number one,’ then you have the tone, ‘Number two,’ then the tone and so on. So with two cassette recorders they can put together a series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Any idiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls he wants.”</p><p> “嗯，他们采取他们的器官及其卡式录音机，并开始在器官的音调中敲击整个电话号码，包括国家代码，路由指令，'kp'和'开始'音调。或者，如果他们没有器官，那么电话线上的某人就会用记录的所有音调发出一个盒式磁带，用声音说'第一个，'然后你有音调，'二号，'那么音调等等。因此，使用两个盒式录像机，它们可以通过从号码的来回切换到数字来组合一系列电话号码。这个国家的任何白痴都有一个廉价的卡带录音机可以制作他想要的所有免费电话。“</p><p> “You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up to the mouthpiece and switch in a series of beeps you’ve recorded? The phone thinks that anything that makes these tones must be its own equipment?”</p><p> “你的意思是你只是把卡式录音机拿到吹嘴，并在你录制的一系列哔哔声中切换？这款手机认为任何让这些音调必须是自己的设备的东西吗？“</p><p> “Right. As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of the phone company’s tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voice talking to it. The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the phone. An operator could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company’s electronic tone generator, but the phone company’s switching circuit can’t tell them apart. The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human operators it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone phreaking.”</p><p> “对。只要你在每秒电话公司的音调中获得30周期的频率，手机设备认为它听到了自己的声音与之交谈。原来的爷爷手机Phreak是这个盲人的孩子，乔·埃格里亚队，曾经吹进手机。操作员可以讲述他的哨声和电话公司的电子音发电机之间的区别，但电话公司的开关电路无法分开。手机公司获得的较大程度和远离人类运营商的越来越脆弱，它变得越脆弱，它变成了各种各样的手机。“</p><p>   “But wait a minute,” I stop Gilbertson. “If everything you do sounds like phone-company equipment, why doesn’t the phone company charge you for the call the way it charges its own equipment?”</p><p>   “但等一下，”我停止吉尔伯顿。 “如果您所做的一切都喜欢手机公司设备，为什么手机公司没有向您收取您自己设备的通话费用？” </p><p> “Okay. That’s where the 2600-cycle tone comes in. I better start from the beginning.”</p><p>“好的。这就是2600周期的音调进来的地方。我从一开始就更好地开始。“</p><p> The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the continent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from each of the hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices. Each toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long-distance tandems constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.</p><p> 他对我描述的开始是大陆的电话系统的愿景，作为数千个腹板，从数百个收费转换办公室辐射到其他收费转换办公室。每个收费交换机都是蜂巢压缩的数千次长距离串联，不断吹口哨和令人振奋到围栏的收费转换办公室。</p><p> The tandem is the key to the whole system. Each tandem is a line with some relays with the capability of signaling any other tandem in any other toll switching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programming a roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes are busy. For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities, your tandem in New York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to a tandem in New Orleans, then up to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleans tandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up to Los Angeles.</p><p> 串联是整个系统的关键。每个串联都是一种带有一些继电器的线路，其能够在大陆上的任何其他收费交换机办公室中的任何其他串联信号，无论是一对一的一对一还是通过其他几个串联编程迂回路线，如果所有直接路由都忙碌。例如，如果您想从纽约打电话给洛杉矶和交通在两个城市之间的所有直接中继线上，您在纽约的串联被编程为尝试下一个最佳路线，这可能会让您送到串联队新奥尔良，然后到了旧金山，或向新奥尔良串联，回到亚特兰大串联，终于到了洛杉矶。</p><p> When a tandem is not being used, when it’s sitting there waiting for someone to make a long-distance call, it whistles. One side of the tandem, the side “facing” your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the home phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is at their service, should they be interested in making a long-distance call. The other side of the tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long-distance trunk lines, telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a call through that trunk at the moment, that it has no use for that trunk at the moment.</p><p> 当没有使用串联时，当它坐在那里时，等待某人进行长途电话，它吹口哨。串联的一面，侧面“面向”你的家庭电话，每秒2600个周期的吹口哨向所有的家庭手机由交换服务，告诉他们它是在他们的服务中，他们是否有兴趣制作长途电话。串联的另一边是吹口哨2600 c.p.s.进入一个或多个长距离的中继线，告诉其余的电话系统，即目前既不发送也不会通过该突发器接收呼叫，即目前它没有使用该主干。</p><p> As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles of the phone company’s tones, the phone equipment think it hears its own voice. The original granddaddy phone phreak was a blind kid with perfect pitch.</p><p> 只要你在手机公司音调的三十周周期内获得频率，手机设备认为它听到了自己的声音。原来的爷爷手机Phreak是一个完美的球场的盲人孩子。</p><p> When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that you are hooked into a tandem. A register comes up to the side of the tandem facing away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed. This sending side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line. When a tandem stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said to be “seized,” and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed—converted into multi-frequency beep tones—to a tandem in the area code and central office you want.</p><p> 当你拨打长距离编号时，就是你陷入串联的第一件事。一个寄存器朝着远离你的串联侧面，并展示了你拨打的号码。该串联的发送侧停止吹口哨2600进入其行李箱线。当串联停止2600色调它一直通过行李箱发送时，主干被称为“抓住”，现在准备随身携带的数字转换为多频哔声 - 到串联您想要的区域代码和中心办公室。</p><p> Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have its headquarters in Los Angeles. The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops sending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles, thereby seizing the trunk. Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a tandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles. The receiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens to the beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring, and starts ringing the 800 number. Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tape notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. has been initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is routine so far.</p><p> 现在，当蓝盒操作员想要从新奥尔良拨打纽约的呼叫时，他首先拨打800个公司，这可能发生在洛杉矶的总部。新奥尔良的送方串联停止向洛杉矶中央办公室发送2600，从而抓住了行李箱。您的新奥尔良串联开始向串联发送蜂鸣声，它发现了洛杉矶的闲置了2600次循环。该L.A.串联的接收结束被抓住，停止吹口哨2600，侦听告诉它的哔哔声，告诉它的嘟嘟声，并开始振铃800号码。与此同时，新奥尔良办公室会计磁带中制作的标志注意到从新的Orleans手机到L.A中的800号电话的呼叫已启动并发出代码号码。到目前为止一切都是例行。 </p><p> But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the 2600-cycle button, sending 2600 out from the New Orleans tandem to the L.A. tandem. The L.A. tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and assumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle. The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number. But as soon as the phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button, the L.A. tandem assumes the trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for a new series of digit tones—to find out where it must send the call.</p><p>但是，手机关键字将他的蓝色箱压出喉舌并按下2600周期按钮，从新奥尔良串联发送2600次，向L.A.串联。 L.A.Tandem注意到2600个周期再次超过该线，并假设新奥尔良已经挂断了，因为行李箱吹口哨就像空闲一样。 L.A. Tandem立即停止振铃L.A. 800号码。但是一旦Phreak将手指从2600纽扣中拿出来，La Tandem假定后备箱再次被使用，因为2600消失了，所以它会听取一系列新的数字音调 - 找出它必须发送的地方称呼。</p><p> Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A. which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next. The blue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell the L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City. Which it promptly does. As soon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleans tandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and starts carrying his voice to you by way of the L.A. tandem. A notation is made on the accounting tape that the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and noted earlier. When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the 800 call has ended.</p><p> 因此，新奥尔良的蓝箱操作员现在在L.A中与串联联系。哪个是等待的顺从的精灵被告知下一步。然后蓝箱老板发出纽约人的十位数，告诉L.A. Tandem致电对纽约市的呼吁。它及时它。一旦你的派对在纽约拿起电话，新奥尔良的一侧面对你就会停止向你发送2600次循环，并开始通过L.A.串联向您带来声音。在会计磁带上进行了一个表示法，即在早些时候发起并注意到的800个呼叫上进行了连接。当你停止与纽约交谈时，一个表示法则已经结束了800个电话。</p><p> At three the next morning, when the phone company’s accounting computer starts reading back over the master accounting tape for the past day, it records that a call of a certain length of time was made from your</p><p> 在第二天早上三，当电话公司的会计计算机开始阅读过去一天的主会计磁带时，它记录了一定长度的呼叫是由你制作的</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestacksreader.com/secrets-of-the-blue-box-ron-rosenbaum-steve-jobs-influence/">http://www.thestacksreader.com/secrets-of-the-blue-box-ron-rosenbaum-steve-jobs-influence/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/盒子/">#盒子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/blue/">#blue</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电话/">#电话</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
