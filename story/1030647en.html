Thus the key decision makers—the unit leaders—lack a deep understanding of all the domains that answer to them.</p><p>它们通常被组织成业务单位，每个业务单位都有自己的一组功能。因此，关键的决策者-单位领导-缺乏对所有与他们相关的领域的深刻理解。</p><p>    The company is organized around functions, and expertise aligns with decision rights. Leaders are cross-functionally collaborative and deeply knowledgeable about details.</p><p>公司围绕职能进行组织，专业知识与决策权保持一致。领导者具有跨职能的协作性，并且对细节了如指掌。</p><p>    Apple is well known for its innovations in hardware, software, and services. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000 employees and $7 billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned, to 137,000 employees and $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Much less well known are the organizational design and the associated leadership model that have played a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.</p><p>苹果以其在硬件、软件和服务方面的创新而闻名。多亏了他们，它从1997年史蒂夫·乔布斯回归时的约8000名员工和70亿美元的收入增长到2019年的13.7万名员工和2600亿美元的收入。鲜为人知的是组织设计和相关的领导模式，它们在公司的创新成功中发挥了关键作用。</p><p>    When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional structure for a company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each with its own P&amp;L responsibilities. General managers ran the Macintosh products group, the information appliances division, and the server products division, among others. As is often the case with decentralized business units, managers were inclined to fight with one another, over transfer prices in particular. Believing that conventional management had stifled innovation, Jobs, in his first year returning as CEO, laid off the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the entire company under one P&amp;L, and combined the disparate functional departments of the business units into one functional organization.</p><p>当乔布斯回到苹果的时候，对于像他这样规模和范围的公司来说，它有一个传统的结构。它被划分为业务部门，每个部门都有自己的盈亏责任。总经理们管理着麦金塔产品集团、信息家电事业部和服务器产品事业部等。就像分散经营的业务部门经常出现的情况一样，经理们倾向于相互争斗，特别是在转移价格上。乔布斯认为传统管理扼杀了创新，在他重新担任首席执行官的第一年，他(在一天内)解雇了所有业务部门的总经理，将整个公司置于一个损益表之下，并将业务部门中不同的职能部门合并为一个职能组织。</p><p>  The adoption of a functional structure may have been unsurprising for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What  is surprising—in fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, even though the company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more complex than it was in 1998. Senior vice presidents are in charge of functions, not products. As was the case with Jobs before him, CEO Tim Cook occupies the only position on the organizational chart where the design, engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of Apple’s main products meet. In effect, besides the CEO, the company operates with no conventional general managers: people who control an entire process from product development through sales and are judged according to a P&amp;L statement.</p><p>对于当时苹果这样规模的公司来说，采用功能性结构可能并不令人意外。令人惊讶的是，尽管苹果的营收是1998年的近40倍，也远比1998年复杂，但苹果今天仍然保留了这一点，这一点令人惊讶。高级副总裁负责职能，而不是产品。就像他之前的乔布斯一样，首席执行官蒂姆·库克在组织结构图上占据着唯一的位置，在苹果的任何主要产品的设计、工程、运营、营销和零售方面都有交汇之处。实际上，除了首席执行官，该公司没有传统的总经理：他们控制着从产品开发到销售的整个过程，并根据宝洁的一份声明进行评判。</p><p>  Business history and organizational theory make the case that as entrepreneurial firms grow large and complex, they must shift from a functional to a multidivisional structure to align accountability and control and prevent the congestion that occurs when countless decisions flow up the org chart to the very top. Giving business unit leaders full control over key functions allows them to do what is best to meet the needs of their individual units’ customers and maximize their results, and it enables the executives overseeing them to assess their performance. As the Harvard Business School historian Alfred Chandler documented, U.S. companies such as DuPont and General Motors moved from a functional to a multidivisional structure in the early 20th century. By the latter half of the century the vast majority of large corporations had followed suit. Apple proves that this conventional approach is not necessary and that the functional structure may benefit companies facing tremendous technological change and industry upheaval.</p><p>商业历史和组织理论表明，随着创业型公司规模的扩大和复杂性的增加，它们必须从职能结构转变为多部门结构，以使责任和控制保持一致，并防止当无数决策沿着组织结构图向上流动到最高层时发生的拥堵。赋予业务部门领导对关键职能的完全控制权，使他们能够做最能满足各自单位客户需求并最大化其结果的事情，并使监督他们的高管能够评估他们的业绩。正如哈佛商学院(Harvard Business School)历史学家阿尔弗雷德·钱德勒(Alfred Chandler)所记录的那样，杜邦(DuPont)和通用汽车(General Motors)等美国公司在20世纪初从功能性结构转变为多部门结构。到本世纪下半叶，绝大多数大公司都效仿了这一做法。苹果证明，这种传统的方法没有必要，这种功能结构可能会让面临巨大技术变革和行业剧变的公司受益。</p><p>  Apple’s commitment to a functional organization does not mean that its structure has remained static. As the importance of artificial intelligence and other new areas has increased, that structure has changed. Here we discuss the innovation benefits and leadership challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational model, which may be useful for individuals and companies wanting to better understand how to succeed in rapidly changing environments.</p><p>苹果对一个功能性组织的承诺并不意味着它的结构一直保持不变。随着人工智能和其他新领域的重要性增加，这种结构已经改变。在这里，我们讨论苹果独特且不断发展的组织模式的创新优势和领导力挑战，对于希望更好地了解如何在快速变化的环境中取得成功的个人和公司来说，这可能是有用的。</p><p>    Apple’s main purpose is to create products that enrich people’s daily lives. That involves not only developing entirely new product categories such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch, but also continually innovating within those categories. Perhaps no product feature better reflects Apple’s commitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone camera. When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs devoted only six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote event for unveiling new products. Since then iPhone camera technology has contributed to the photography industry with a stream of innovations: High dynamic range imaging (2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone flash (2013), optical image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), portrait mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode (2019) are but a few of the improvements.</p><p>苹果的主要目的是创造丰富人们日常生活的产品。这不仅包括开发全新的产品类别，如iPhone和Apple Watch，还包括在这些类别中不断创新。也许没有什么产品功能比iPhone摄像头更能体现苹果对持续创新的承诺。2007年，当iPhone问世时，史蒂夫·乔布斯在一年一度的发布新产品的主旨活动中，只花了6秒的时间在相机上。从那时起，iPhone相机技术以一系列创新为摄影业做出了贡献：高动态范围成像(2010)、全景照片(2012)、真色调闪光灯(2013)、光学稳像(2015)、双镜头相机(2016)、肖像模式(2016)、肖像照明(2017)和夜间模式(2019年)只是其中的一小部分改进。</p><p>    To create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure that centers on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief is that those with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights for that domain. This is based on two views: First, Apple competes in markets where the rates of technological change and disruption are high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people with deep knowledge of the technologies responsible for disruption. Long before it can get market feedback and solid market forecasts, the company must make bets about which technologies and designs are likely to succeed in smartphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts rather than general managers increases the odds that those bets will pay off.</p><p>为了创造这样的创新，苹果依赖于以功能专业知识为中心的结构。它的基本信念是，那些在某个领域拥有最多专业知识和经验的人应该拥有该领域的决策权。这是基于两种观点：首先，苹果在技术变革和颠覆率较高的市场上竞争，因此它必须依靠对导致颠覆的技术有深刻了解的人的判断和直觉。早在获得市场反馈和可靠的市场预测之前，该公司就必须押注哪些技术和设计可能在智能手机、电脑等领域取得成功。依赖技术专家而不是总经理会增加这些赌注获得回报的可能性。</p><p>  Second, Apple’s commitment to offer the best possible products would be undercut if short-term profit and cost targets were the overriding criteria for judging investments and leaders. Significantly, the bonuses of senior R&amp;D executives are based on companywide performance numbers rather than the costs of or revenue from particular products. Thus product decisions are somewhat insulated from short-term financial pressures. The finance team is not involved in the product road map meetings of engineering teams, and engineering teams are not involved in pricing decisions.</p><p>其次，如果短期利润和成本目标是评判投资和领导者的压倒一切的标准，那么苹果提供尽可能好的产品的承诺将被削弱。值得注意的是，高级研发主管的奖金是基于整个公司的业绩数据，而不是特定产品的成本或收入。因此，产品决策在某种程度上不会受到短期财务压力的影响。财务团队不参与工程团队的产品路线图会议，工程团队不参与定价决策。</p><p>  We don’t mean to suggest that Apple doesn’t consider costs and revenue goals when deciding which technologies and features the company will pursue. It does, but in ways that differ from those employed by conventionally organized companies. Instead of using overall cost and price targets as fixed parameters within which to make design and engineering choices, R&amp;D leaders are expected to weigh the benefits to users of those choices against cost considerations.</p><p>我们并不是说苹果在决定公司将追求哪些技术和功能时不考虑成本和收入目标。是的，但方式与传统组织的公司不同。研发领导者不会把总体成本和价格目标作为做出设计和工程选择的固定参数，而是应该权衡这些选择给用户带来的好处和成本考量。</p><p>  In a functional organization, individual and team reputations act as a control mechanism in placing bets. A case in point is the decision to introduce the dual-lens camera with portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016. It was a big wager that the camera’s impact on users would be sufficiently great to justify its significant cost.</p><p>在职能组织中，个人和团队声誉在下注时起着控制机制的作用。一个很好的例子是2016年决定在iPhone 7 Plus中引入双镜头肖像模式摄像头。这是一场豪赌，认为这款相机对用户的影响将足以证明其巨大的成本是合理的。</p><p>  One executive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader who played a central role in the portrait mode effort, was “out over his skis,” meaning that he and his team were taking a big risk: If users were unwilling to pay a premium for a phone with a more costly and better camera, the team would most likely have less credibility the next time it proposed an expensive upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a defining feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further enhanced the reputations of Hubel and his team.</p><p>一位高管告诉我们，在肖像模式努力中发挥核心作用的高级领导人保罗·胡贝尔(Paul Hubel)“对他的滑雪板感到失望”，这意味着他和他的团队正在冒很大的风险：如果用户不愿意为摄像头更昂贵、更好的手机支付溢价，那么下一次团队提出昂贵的升级或功能时，他们的可信度很可能会下降。事实证明，摄像头是iPhone7 Plus的一项决定性功能，它的成功进一步提高了胡贝尔和他的团队的声誉。</p><p>    It’s easier to get the balance right between an attention to costs and the value added to the user experience when the leaders making decisions are those with deep expertise in their areas rather than general managers being held accountable primarily for meeting numerical targets. Whereas the fundamental principle of a conventional business unit structure is to align accountability and control, the fundamental principle of a functional organization is to align expertise and decision rights.</p><p>当领导者做出决策时，更容易在关注成本和增加用户体验价值之间取得平衡，因为领导者在各自领域拥有深厚的专业知识，而不是总经理主要负责实现数字目标。传统业务单位结构的基本原则是协调责任和控制，而职能组织的基本原则是协调专业知识和决策权。</p><p>  Thus the link between how Apple is organized and the type of innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler famously argued, “structure follows strategy”—even though Apple doesn’t use the structure that he anticipated large multinationals would adopt.</p><p>因此，苹果的组织方式和它产生的创新类型之间的联系是显而易见的。正如钱德勒的著名论断，“结构跟随战略”--尽管苹果没有使用他预期的大型跨国公司将采用的结构。</p><p>      Ever since Steve Jobs implemented the functional organization, Apple’s managers at every level, from senior vice president on down, have been expected to possess three key leadership characteristics: deep expertise that allows them to meaningfully engage in all the work being done within their individual functions; immersion in the details of those functions; and a willingness to collaboratively debate other functions during collective decision-making. When managers have these attributes, decisions are made in a coordinated fashion by the people most qualified to make them.</p><p>自从史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)实施职能组织以来，苹果公司各级管理人员，从高级副总裁到下一级，都被期望拥有三个关键的领导特征：深厚的专业知识，使他们能够有意义地参与到各自职能范围内的所有工作中；沉浸在这些职能的细节中；愿意在集体决策期间就其他职能进行协作辩论。当管理者具备这些特质时，最有资格做出决策的人会以协调一致的方式做出决策。</p><p>    Apple is not a company where general managers oversee managers; rather, it is a company where experts lead experts. The assumption is that it’s easier to train an expert to manage well than to train a manager to be an expert. At Apple, hardware experts manage hardware, software experts software, and so on. (Deviations from this principle are rare.) This approach cascades down all levels of the organization through areas of ever-increasing specialization. Apple’s leaders believe that world-class talent wants to work for and with other world-class talent in a specialty. It’s like joining a sports team where you get to learn from and play with the best.</p><p>苹果不是一家总经理监督经理的公司；相反，它是一家专家带领专家的公司。我们的假设是，把一位专家培养成一名优秀的管理专家，要比把一位经理培养成一名专家容易得多。在苹果，硬件专家管理硬件，软件专家管理软件等等。(偏离这一原则的情况很少见。)。这种方法通过不断增长的专业化领域向下延伸到组织的所有级别。苹果的领导人相信，世界级的人才希望在某一专业领域为其他世界级的人才工作，并与其他世界级的人才一起工作。这就像加入了一支运动队，在那里你可以向最好的人学习，并与最好的人一起比赛。</p><p>    Early on, Steve Jobs came to embrace the idea that managers at Apple should be experts in their area of management. In a 1984 interview he said, “We went through that stage in Apple where we went out and thought,  Oh, we’re gonna be a big company, let’s hire professional management. We went out and hired a bunch of professional management. It didn’t work at all….They knew how to manage, but they didn’t know how to  do anything. If you’re a great person, why do you want to work for somebody you can’t learn anything from? And you know what’s interesting? You know who the best managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never, ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be…because no one else is going to…do as good a job.”</p><p>很早，史蒂夫·乔布斯就开始接受这样一种观点，即苹果的经理们应该成为各自管理领域的专家。在1984年的一次采访中，他说，“我们在苹果经历了那个阶段，我们走出去想，哦，我们会成为一家大公司，让我们聘请专业的管理人员。我们出去雇了一群专业的管理人员。这根本不管用，…。1.他们知道如何管理，但他们什么都不知道。如果你是一个伟大的人，为什么你想要为一个你什么都学不到的人工作呢？你知道有趣的是什么吗？你知道谁是最好的经理吗？他们是伟大的个人贡献者，他们从来没有想过要成为一名经理，但却决定必须成为…。因为没有人会去…。尽最大努力做好这件事。“。</p><p>  One current example is Roger Rosner, who heads Apple’s software application business, which includes work-productivity apps such as Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote (presentations) along with GarageBand (music composition), iMovie (movie editing), and News (an app providing news content). Rosner, who studied electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, joined Apple in 2001 as a senior engineering manager and rose to become the director of iWork applications, the vice president of productivity apps, and since 2013 the VP of applications. With his deep expertise gained from previous experience as the director of engineering at several smaller software companies, Rosner exemplifies an expert leading experts.</p><p>目前的一个例子是罗杰·罗斯纳(Roger Rosner)，他负责苹果的软件应用业务，包括Pages(文字处理)、Numbers(电子表格)和Keynote(演示)等提高工作效率的应用，以及GarageBand(音乐创作)、iMovie(电影编辑)和News(提供新闻内容的应用)。罗斯纳曾在卡内基梅隆大学(Carnegie Mellon)学习电气工程，2001年加入苹果担任高级工程经理，并晋升为iWork应用总监、生产力应用副总裁，并自2013年以来担任应用副总裁。罗斯纳从之前担任几家较小软件公司的工程总监的经验中获得了深厚的专业知识，他是专家和领军专家的典范。</p><p>  In a functional organization, experts leading experts means that specialists create a deep bench in a given area, where they can learn from one another. For example, Apple’s more than 600 experts on camera hardware technology work in a group led by Graham Townsend, a camera expert. Because iPhones, iPads, laptops, and desktop computers all include cameras, these experts would be scattered across product lines if Apple were organized in business units. That would dilute their collective expertise, reducing their power to solve problems and generate and refine innovations.</p><p>在一个职能组织中，专家领导专家意味着专家在特定的领域创造一个很深的长凳，在那里他们可以相互学习。例如，苹果公司的600多名相机硬件技术专家在一个由相机专家格雷厄姆·汤森(Graham Townsend)领导的小组中工作。由于iPhone、iPad、笔记本电脑和台式电脑都包括摄像头，如果苹果按业务部门组织，这些专家将分散在不同的产品线上。这将稀释他们的集体专业知识，降低他们解决问题、产生和完善创新的能力。</p><p>    One principle that permeates Apple is “Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels down,” because that is essential for speedy and effective cross-functional decision-making at the highest levels. If managers attend a decision-making meeting without the details at their disposal, the decision must either be made without the details or postponed. Managers tell war stories about making presentations to senior leaders who drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test result on a product.</p><p>苹果普遍遵循的一条原则是“领导者应该知道他们组织的三层以下的细节”，因为这对最高层快速有效的跨职能决策至关重要。如果经理们在没有掌握细节的情况下参加决策会议，那么要么在没有细节的情况下做出决策，要么推迟决策。经理们讲述了向高级领导做演示的战争故事，这些高级领导深入到电子表格、代码行或产品测试结果的单元格中。</p><p>  Of course, the leaders of many companies insist that they and their teams are steeped in the details. But few organizations match Apple. Consider how its senior leaders pay extreme attention to the exact shape of products’ rounded corners. The standard method for rounding corners is to use an arc of a circle to connect the perpendicular sides of a rectangular object, which produces a somewhat abrupt transition from straight to curve. In contrast, Apple’s leaders insist on continuous curves, resulting in a shape known in the design community as a “squircle”: The slope starts sooner but is less abrupt.  An advantage of hardware products without abrupt changes in curvature is that they produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light reflection along the corner). The difference is subtle, and executing on it isn’t simply a matter of a more complicated mathematical formula. It demands that Apple’s operations leaders commit to extremely precise manufacturing tolerances to produce millions of iPhones and other products with squircles. This deep immersion in detail isn’t just a concern that is pushed down to lower-level people; it is central at the leadership level.</p><p>当然，许多公司的领导人坚称，他们和他们的团队都沉浸在细节中。但很少有组织能与苹果相提并论。想想它的高级领导是如何极其关注产品圆角的确切形状的。圆角的标准方法是使用圆的圆弧连接矩形对象的垂直边，这会产生从直线到曲线的有点陡峭的过渡。相比之下，苹果的领导人坚持使用连续的曲线，从而形成了设计界所熟知的“蠕动”形状：坡度开始得更快，但不那么陡峭。没有曲率突变的硬件产品的一个优点是它们会产生更柔和的高光(也就是说，沿着拐角的光反射很少跳跃，甚至没有跳跃)。差别是微妙的，在它上面执行不仅仅是一个更复杂的数学公式的问题。它要求苹果的运营领导人承诺极其精确的制造公差，以生产数百万部iPhone和其他带有蠕动的产品。这种对细节的深度沉浸不仅是下层人员关心的问题，也是领导层的核心问题。</p><p>    Having leaders who are experts in their areas and can go deep into the details has profound implications for how Apple is run. Leaders can push, probe, and “smell” an issue. They know which details are important and where to focus their attention. Many people at Apple see it as liberating, even exhilarating, to work for experts, who provide better guidance and mentoring than a general manager would. Together, all can strive to do the best work of their lives in their chosen area.</p><p>拥有各自领域的专家并能深入细节的领导者对苹果的运营方式有着深远的影响。领导者可以推动、调查和“嗅探”问题。他们知道哪些细节是重要的，应该把注意力集中在哪里。苹果的许多人认为，为专家工作是一种解放，甚至是令人振奋的事情，因为专家提供的指导和指导比总经理更好。团结起来，所有人都可以努力在他们选择的领域做他们一生中最好的工作。</p><p>      Apple has hundreds of specialist teams across the company, dozens of which may be needed for even one key component of a new product offering. For example, the dual-lens camera with portrait mode required the collaboration of no fewer than 40 specialist teams: silicon design, camera software, reliability engineering, motion sensor hardware, video engineering, core motion, and camera sensor design, to name just a few. How on earth does Apple develop and ship products that require such coordination? The answer is collaborative debate. Because no function is responsible for a product or a service on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial.</p><p>苹果拥有数百名专家</p><p>  When debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, higher-level managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at times the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with sufficient attention to detail is challenging for even the best of leaders, making it all the more important that the company fill many senior positions from within the ranks of its VPs, who have experience in Apple’s way of operating.</p><p>当辩论陷入僵局时，就像一些人不可避免的那样，更高级别的经理会介入，成为决胜局的决胜者，有时包括首席执行官和高级副总裁。即使对于最优秀的领导者来说，要在足够关注细节的情况下快速做到这一点也是具有挑战性的，这使得该公司从副总裁队伍中填补许多高级职位变得更加重要，这些副总裁对苹果的运营方式有经验。</p><p>  However, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive team can resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The many horizontal dependencies mean that ineffective peer relationships at the VP and director levels have the potential to undermine not only particular projects but the entire company. Consequently, for people to attain and remain in a leadership position within a function, they must be highly effective collaborators.</p><p>然而，考虑到苹果的规模和范围，即使是高管团队也只能解决有限数量的僵局。许多水平依赖关系意味着副总裁和主管级别的无效同事关系不仅有可能破坏特定的项目，而且有可能破坏整个公司。因此，为了让人们在一个职能部门内获得并保持领导地位，他们必须是高效的合作者。</p><p>  That doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of view. Leaders are expected to hold strong, well-grounded views and advocate forcefully for them, yet also be willing to change their minds when presented with evidence that others’ views are better. Doing so is not always easy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and open-minded is facilitated by two things: deep understanding of and devotion to the company’s values and common purpose, and a commitment to separating how  right from how  hard a particular path is so that the difficulty of executing a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected.</p><p>这并不意味着人们不能表达他们的观点。人们期望领导人持有强有力的、有根据的观点，并有力地倡导这些观点，但当有证据表明其他人的观点更好时，他们也愿意改变主意。当然，这样做并不总是那么容易。领导者兼具党派和开放思想的能力得益于两件事：对公司价值观和共同目标的深刻理解和奉献，以及承诺将特定道路的正确程度与艰难程度区分开来，这样执行决策的困难就不会阻止决策被选中。</p><p>  The development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates a fanatical attention to detail at the leadership level, intense collaborative debate among teams, and the power of a shared purpose to shape and ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 Hubel had the idea of developing an iPhone feature that would allow people to take portrait photos with  bokeh—a Japanese term that refers to the pleasing blurring of a background—which photography experts generally consider to be of the highest quality. At that time only expensive single-lens reflex cameras could take such photos, but Hubel thought that with a dual-lens design and advanced computational-photography techniques, Apple could add the capability in the iPhone. His idea aligned well with the camera team’s stated purpose: “More people taking better images more of the time.”</p><p>IPhone肖像模式的发展显示了领导层对细节的狂热关注，团队之间激烈的合作辩论，以及塑造并最终解决辩论的共同目标的力量。2009年，胡贝尔有了开发iPhone功能的想法，可以让人们用bokeh拍摄肖像照片-bokeh是一个日语术语，指的是令人愉悦的背景模糊-摄影专家通常认为bokeh是质量最高的。当时只有昂贵的单镜头反光相机才能拍摄这样的照片，但胡贝尔认为，通过双镜头设计和先进的计算摄影技术，苹果可以在iPhone中添加这一功能。他的想法很好地契合了摄制组宣称的目标：“更多的人在更多的时间拍摄更好的图像。”</p><p>  As the team worked to turn this idea into reality, several challenges emerged. The first attempts produced some amazing portrait pictures but also a number of “failure cases” in which the algorithm was unable to distinguish between the central object in sharp relief (a face, for instance) and the background being blurred. For example, if a person’s face was to be photographed from behind chicken wire, it was not possible to construct an algorithm that would capture the chicken wire to the side of the face with the same sharpness as the chicken wire in front of it. The wire to the side would be as blurred as the background.</p><p>当团队努力将这一想法变成现实时，出现了几个挑战。第一次尝试产生了一些令人惊叹的肖像图片，但也出现了一些“失败案例”，在这些案例中，算法无法区分清晰浮雕的中心物体(例如，一张脸)和模糊的背景。例如，如果一个人的脸是从铁丝网后面拍摄的，就不可能构建一个算法，以与前面的铁丝网一样的锐度将铁丝网捕捉到脸部的一侧。侧面的电线会和背景一样模糊。</p><p>  One might say, “Who cares about the chicken wire case? That’s exceedingly rare.” But for the team, sidestepping rare or extreme situations—what engineers call  corner cases—would violate Apple’s strict engineering standard of zero “artifacts,” meaning “any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology.” Corner cases sparked “many tough discussions” between the camera team and other teams involved, recalls Myra Haggerty, the VP of sensor software and UX prototyping, who oversaw the firmware and algorithm teams. Sebastien Marineau-Mes, the VP to whom the camera software team ultimately reported, decided to defer the release of the feature until the following year to give the team time to better address failure cases—“a hard pill to swallow,” Hubel admits.</p><p>有人可能会说，“谁会在乎铁丝网的案子呢？这是极其罕见的。“。但对于该团队来说，回避罕见或极端的情况--工程师们称之为“拐角情况”--将违反苹果严格的工程标准，即零“人工制品”，即“通过涉及的技术和/或技术在数字过程中引入的任何不受欢迎或无意的数据更改”。负责固件和算法团队的传感器软件和UX原型副总裁迈拉·哈格蒂(Myra Haggerty)回忆说，角落案件在相机团队和其他相关团队之间引发了“许多艰难的讨论”。相机软件团队最终向其报告的副总裁塞巴斯蒂安·马里诺-梅斯(Sebastien Marineau-Mes)决定将该功能的发布推迟到次年，以便让团队有时间更好地解决失败案例--胡贝尔承认，这是“一颗难以下咽的药丸”。</p><p>  To get some agreement on quality standards, the engineering teams invited senior design and marketing leaders to meet, figuring that they would offer a new perspective. The design leaders brought an additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, “What makes a beautiful portrait?” To help reassess the zero-artifacts standard, they collected images from great portrait photographers. They noted, among other things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a face but sharpness on the eyes. So they charged the algorithm teams with achieving the same effect. When the teams succeeded, they knew they had an acceptable standard.</p><p>为了在质量标准上达成一致，工程团队邀请了资深设计和营销负责人会面，认为他们将提供一个新的视角。设计领导们给辩论带来了额外的艺术敏感性，他们问道：“是什么构成了一幅美丽的肖像画？”为了帮助重新评估零人工制品的标准，他们从伟大的肖像摄影师那里收集了图像。他们注意到，除了其他因素外，这些照片通常在脸部边缘模糊，但在眼睛上却很锐利。因此，他们要求算法团队实现同样的效果。当球队成功时，他们知道他们有一个可以接受的标准。</p><p>  Another issue that emerged was the ability to preview a portrait photo with a blurred background. The camera team had designed the feature so that users could see its effect on their photos only  after they had been taken, but the human interface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting that users should be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance about how to make adjustments  before taking the photo. Johnnie Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera team a demo. “When we saw the demo, we realized that this is what we needed to do,” Townsend told us. The members of his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do it, but difficulty was not an acceptable excuse for failing to deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After months of engineering effort, a key stakeholder, the video engineering team (responsible for the low-level software that controls sensor and camera operations) found a way, and the collaboration paid off. Portrait mode was central to Apple’s marketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved a major reason for users’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of the phone.</p><p>出现的另一个问题是预览背景模糊的肖像照片的能力。摄像团队设计了这一功能，以便用户只有在拍照后才能看到照片上的效果，但人性化界面(HI)设计团队进行了反击，坚持要求用户在拍照前应该能够看到“实时预览”，并获得一些关于如何进行调整的指导。HI团队成员约翰尼·曼扎里(Johnnie Manzari)给摄制组做了演示。汤森告诉我们：“当我们看到演示时，我们意识到这就是我们需要做的。”</p><p>  As this example shows, Apple’s collaborat</p><p>如本例所示，苹果的合作。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-apple-is-organized-for-innovation">https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-apple-is-organized-for-innovation</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/创新/">#创新</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/organized/">#organized</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030616.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_5b552713e2b268cc98eb7ba4b741bd2d.jpeg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030616.html">苹果开始隐藏其Mac应用程序的流量</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-23 1:53</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030596.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_4ba1f2679567f68d92bfa6c4b77733e8.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1030596.html">
