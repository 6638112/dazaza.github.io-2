The Spanish Flu was sweeping the world. It would ultimately kill as many as 50 million people.</p><p>那是1918年。西班牙流感席卷全球。它最终将导致多达5000万人死亡。</p><p>  On a small island in the Irish Sea, more than 25,000 men—mostly of German descent—had been  interned. The British government had rounded them up and put them into camps as part of World War I sweeps targeting foreign nationals. One of the prisoners, trying to relieve boredom and keep his fellow inmates fit, began prescribing a sequence of exercises. The man had been a gymnast and boxing coach in Germany, and now he began to fashion machines, some for exercise and some for rehabilitation, out of what he could find at the camp: wood, old beds, salvaged springs for resistance.</p><p>在爱尔兰海的一个小岛上，超过25000名男子被拘留，其中大部分是德国后裔。作为第一次世界大战针对外国人的扫荡行动的一部分，英国政府将他们围捕起来，并将他们关进营地。其中一名囚犯试图缓解无聊感，让其他囚犯保持健康，于是开始开处方进行一系列锻炼。这名男子曾在德国担任体操运动员和拳击教练，现在他开始用营地里能找到的东西来打造机器，有些用于锻炼，有些用于康复：木头、旧床、回收的抵抗弹簧。</p><p> Years later, after immigrating to America, the trainer would recall his days at the Knockaloe Camp on the windswept island. He’d say that, even as influenza marauded across Europe, his comrades, using his routine, stayed healthy. He’d repeat the claim in interviews and to students he taught at his New York studio, one of whom retold the story for an Isle of Man historian: “[He] had the opportunity to work with all these gentlemen who were coming in with different problems and different ailments, and [with] exercises given on a regular basis, they did not get the influenza that was ravaging everyone,” recalled  Lolita San Miguel, a former ballet dancer who later taught the same exercise method.</p><p>几年后，在移民到美国后，这位教练会回忆起他在风吹岛上的诺克库洛营地的日子。他会说，即使流感肆虐整个欧洲，他的同志们仍然按照他的常规保持健康。他会在采访中和他在纽约工作室教过的学生中重复这一说法，其中一人向马恩岛的一位历史学家复述了这个故事：“他有机会与所有这些带着不同问题和不同疾病来到这里的绅士们一起工作，并且定期进行锻炼，他们没有感染肆虐每个人的流感，”洛丽塔·圣米格尔回忆道，一名前芭蕾舞演员，后来教授同样的锻炼方法。</p><p> The “nobody got sick” assertion became central to the trainer’s regimen, and it was repeated over and over. In a 1962 profile, a writer for Sports Illustrated summarized the legend: “No man who exercised his principles came down with influenza during the great epidemic.” Decades later, when I was embracing the method—first as an injured athlete, and then later as I trained to be a teacher—the “no influenza” tale was repeated as canon.</p><p>“没人生病”的说法成了培训师的养生法的核心，并且反复出现。在1962年的一篇简介中，《体育画报》的一位作家总结了这个传说：“在大流行病期间，没有一个遵循原则的人患上流感。”几十年后，当我作为一名受伤的运动员第一次接受这种方法时，后来当我接受培训成为一名教师时，“没有流感”的故事被作为经典重复。</p><p> The exercise system was originally called “Contrology,” but after the discipline’s founder passed away, in 1967, it became better known by his last name: Pilates.</p><p>这个运动系统最初被称为“控制学”，但在1967年该学科的创始人去世后，它以他的姓氏而闻名：普拉提。</p><p> In case you weren’t sure—or in case you thought it was something only celebrities with buff bodies do—here’s what Pilates really is: a systematic sequence of exercises designed to bring functional strength and flexibility to the whole body. For example, a classic Pilates exercise is “The Teaser,” which has you raise your upper and lower body into a V-like shape while balancing on your tail. Another one—named after the animal it resembles—is called “The Seal,” which has you articulate your spine and roll as you clap your feet together like flippers. The trick is that everything is done from the core.</p><p>如果你不确定，或者你认为这是只有身材健美的名人才会做的事情，那么下面是普拉提的真正含义：一系列系统的锻炼，旨在为整个身体带来功能性力量和灵活性。例如，一个经典的普拉提运动是“挑逗”，它让你把上半身和下半身抬高成V形，同时用尾巴保持平衡。另一种以它相似的动物命名的海豹叫“海豹”，它让你像脚蹼一样把脊椎关节连接起来并滚动。诀窍在于一切都是从核心开始的。</p><p> Social distancing may thwart your preferred exercise plans. Here are 22 apps, YouTube channels, and streaming services offering no-cost workouts.</p><p>社交距离可能会阻碍你首选的锻炼计划。这里有22个应用程序、YouTube频道和流媒体服务，提供免费训练。</p><p> Joseph Pilates was born in Germany in 1883. As a youth, the story goes, he became interested in the fluid movements of house cats and children, and he began to mimic them as he built his own strength, becoming a boxer and gymnast.</p><p>约瑟夫·普拉提1883年出生于德国。故事说，年轻时，他对家猫和孩子们流畅的动作产生了兴趣，并开始模仿他们锻炼自己的力量，成为一名拳击手和体操运动员。</p><p> Pilates moved to England before World War I, and when Germans living there were interned, he was assigned a position as a nurse at the Knockaloe Camp on the Isle of Man. One of his jobs was rehabilitation, and he built custom devices—wheelchairs and bed-mounted exercisers—for the invalids at the camp’s hospital. He was also a boxing coach, and he is given credit for German dominance of the sport (led by men who’d been trained at Knockaloe) in the 1920s.</p><p>普拉提在第一次世界大战前移居英国，当住在那里的德国人被拘留时，他被分配到马恩岛的诺克库洛营地担任护士。他的工作之一是康复，他在营地的医院为残疾人定制轮椅和床上健身器。他还是一名拳击教练，他因在20世纪20年代德国在这项运动中的主导地位（由受过拳击训练的男子领导）而受到赞誉。</p><p> In 1926, after working with future world heavyweight champion Max Schmeling, Pilates was befriended in New York by legendary sports writer  Nat Fleischer. He opened a gymnasium on Eighth Avenue, near Columbus Circle. He also began manufacturing furniture and exercise machines, including a V-shaped bed; a chair that converted into a step resistance device; and one that looked remarkably like a spring-loaded prison cot, which he called the “Reformer.”</p><p>1926年，在与未来的世界重量级冠军马克斯·施梅林合作后，普拉提在纽约得到了传奇体育作家纳特·弗莱舍的友爱。他在第八大道哥伦布圈附近开了一家健身房。他还开始制造家具和运动器械，包括一张V形床；一把椅子，可以转换成一个阶梯阻力装置；还有一个看起来非常像弹簧床，他称之为“改革者”</p><p> Along with his wife, Clara, Pilates always welcomed men and women into his studio, and soon injured dancers began to hear that the method—centered on strengthening what we now call the core, but which Pilates disciples term the “Powerhouse”—could restore them to health. They flocked to his studio.</p><p>普拉提总是和他的妻子克拉拉一起欢迎男男女女来到他的工作室，很快受伤的舞者们开始听说，这种方法的核心是强化我们现在所说的核心，但普拉提弟子称之为“动力”——可以让他们恢复健康。他们蜂拥到他的工作室。</p><p> The principles of Pilates were astonishingly modern. They revolved around what’s known today as “functional fitness,” meaning that the goal wasn’t to look hot or get swole. The aim was to master everyday life and tasks. The method revolved around a series of  34 mat exercises, performed in sequence, that today remain at the heart of Pilates instruction.</p><p>普拉提的原理非常现代。他们围绕着今天所说的“功能性健身”展开，这意味着他们的目标不是让自己看起来很性感或晕眩。目的是掌握日常生活和任务。该方法围绕着一系列34个垫子练习展开，这些练习按顺序进行，今天仍然是普拉提教学的核心。</p><p> After testing 38 yoga mats, Lululemon’s The Reversible Mat 5mm is the one we’d recommend first. We have rubber-free, budget, and travel picks too.</p><p>在测试了38块瑜伽垫后，我们首先推荐Lululemon的5毫米双面瑜伽垫。我们也有无橡胶、预算和旅行选择。</p><p> Pilates was also a master marketer. He advertised his studio in newspapers; he opened a second location in a New York department store; he wrote books and pamphlets. He was wildly quotable. Describing the benefits of his method, he said: “Do animals go on diets? Eat what you want, drink what you want. I drink a quart of liquor a day, plus some beer, and smoke maybe fifteen cigars. And what do Americans do? They play golf, they play baseball, they use half their muscles, a quarter of their muscles. They get fat, they go jogging, they go on crazy diets, they jump up and down in crazy exercises, they have bad backs, they have beer bellies, they slouch, they complain.”</p><p>普拉提也是一位营销大师。他在报纸上宣传他的工作室；他在纽约一家百货公司开了第二家分店；他写书籍和小册子。他很容易被引用。描述他的方法的好处，他说：“动物们节食吗？想吃什么就吃什么，想吃什么就喝什么。我每天喝一夸脱酒，外加一些啤酒，抽十五支雪茄。美国人做什么呢？他们打高尔夫球，打棒球，他们用一半的肌肉，四分之一的肌肉。他们发胖，他们慢跑，他们疯狂节食，他们疯狂地跳上跳下。”他们经常运动，背部不好，啤酒肚，无精打采，他们抱怨。"</p><p> After Pilates died, in 1967, a few of his students, including San Miguel, opened their own studios. By the 1990s, the method had migrated to the West Coast, where it began to gain a reputation—one that I, as a Pilates teacher, have to add I can’t stand—as an exercise regimen best suited to celebrities. Today, thousands of teachers offer Pilates classes, and like any cult worth the name, the method has sectionalized. The version I teach is called “Classical Pilates,” and it tries to stay as close to Joe’s original methods as possible. Since Classical teachers orient themselves toward history, it isn’t surprising that we hear, and often repeat, the influenza origin myth.</p><p>1967年普拉提去世后，他的一些学生，包括圣米格尔，开设了自己的工作室。到了20世纪90年代，这种方法已经转移到了西海岸，在那里它开始获得声誉，作为一名普拉提老师，我不得不补充说，我不能忍受最适合名人的锻炼方式。如今，成千上万的老师开设普拉提课，就像任何名副其实的邪教一样，这种方法已经被分割开来。我教的版本叫做“古典普拉提”，它试图尽可能接近乔的原始方法。由于古典教师将自己定位于历史，因此我们听到并经常重复流感起源的神话并不奇怪。</p><p> The truth, of course, is more complicated. Sean Gallagher is a New York–based physical therapist and Pilates teacher. He is also one of the linear inheritors of the original Pilates legacy, passed down through Clara Pilates and Romana Kryzanowska—a teacher who is usually seen as Joe’s top protégé—and through Kryzanowska to Gallagher. Gallagher owns and has refurbished some of Pilates’s original studio equipment, and he holds workshops at Pilates’s old country home in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, near the legendary Jacob’s Pillow dance center, where Pilates frequently taught during the summers of the 1950s and 1960s. “The flu story is possible,” Gallagher says, “but it is also just as possible it isn’t true. Because the island was so isolated, they didn’t have a big outbreak of influenza. So, if nobody got it, nobody died.” Of course Pilates’s exercise regimen isn’t some magic charm against disease. But Pilates himself was such a believer in his method that he didn’t mind a little bending of the truth, Gallagher adds.</p><p>事实当然更为复杂。肖恩·加拉赫是纽约的物理治疗师和普拉提老师。他也是最初普拉提遗产的线性继承人之一，通过克拉拉·普拉提和罗曼娜·克里扎诺夫斯卡（一位通常被视为乔的顶级门生的教师）以及克里扎诺夫斯卡（Kryzanowska）传给加拉赫（Gallagher）。加拉赫拥有并翻新了普拉提的一些原始工作室设备，他在普拉提位于马萨诸塞州伯克希尔山脉的老家里举办工作室，位于传奇的雅各布枕头舞中心附近，在20世纪50年代和60年代的夏天，普拉提经常在这里授课。加拉赫说：“流感的故事是可能的，但也有可能不是真的。因为岛上非常孤立，他们没有大规模的流感暴发。所以，如果没有人感染，就没有人死亡。”当然，普拉提的锻炼方案并不是对抗疾病的神奇魅力。但加拉赫补充说，普拉提本人非常相信他的方法，所以他不介意稍微歪曲事实。</p><p> Look, exercise is obviously good for you. But no fitness routine—Pilates or anything else—can reliably stop everyone from getting sick, no matter the tall-tale claims of its founder. That said, exercise helps!</p><p>看，锻炼显然对你有好处。但是，无论创立者如何夸张地宣称，任何健身常规普拉提或其他任何东西都不能可靠地阻止每个人生病。也就是说，锻炼有帮助！</p><p> COVID-19 is often more  serious and more fatal to those who aren’t in good physical condition. Here’s an  interesting blog post on COVID-19, exercise, and immunity, published by the American College of Sports Medicine. Here’s another study from 2019 on links between  immunity and exercise.</p><p>2019冠状病毒疾病对身体状况不好的人更为严重，更致命。这是一本2019冠状病毒疾病杂志，由美国运动医学院出版，是COVID-19，运动和免疫。下面是2019年的另一项关于免疫和运动之间联系的研究。</p><p> I love Pilates because it makes me feel good, and because it is deeply systematic: It challenges the body and the brain in a sequence that allows rapid improvement  and lifetime progress. Since the world went into quarantine, I’ve been doing my workouts remotely. I’ve even taken classes with teachers who’ve been trained directly by the original Pilates disciples, former students of both San Miguel and Kryzanowska. It really has kept me from going stir crazy, and that’s a benefit that was definitely felt a century ago on the Isle of Man.</p><p>我喜欢普拉提，因为它让我感觉很好，而且因为它是一种深层次的系统性运动：它以一种顺序挑战身体和大脑，允许快速改善和终身进步。自从世界被隔离以来，我一直在远程锻炼。我甚至和老师们一起上课，他们直接接受了普拉提的原始弟子们的培训，他们曾是圣米格尔和克里扎诺夫斯卡的学生。这真的让我没有发疯，这是一个世纪前马恩岛上肯定能感受到的好处。</p><p> “What he did for his fellow internees was help them stay healthy and fit,” says Pilates biographer  Eva Rincke, who has seen letters to Pilates from his former campmates that thank him for his work. “He was somebody who was able to inspire people, to motivate them to stay fit.” And, Rincke adds, “he helped them not to freak out during that very long time they spent locked away behind barbed wire.”</p><p>普拉提传记作者伊娃·林克（Eva Rincke）说：“他为其他被拘留者所做的是帮助他们保持健康，”她看到了他以前的同学写给普拉提的信，感谢他的工作。“他能够激励人们，激励他们保持健康。”林克补充说，“在他们被锁在铁丝网后面的很长一段时间里，他帮助他们不要惊慌失措。”</p><p> For most self-massage applications, the AmazonBasics High-Density Round Foam Roller 36″ gets the job done. We have picks for different preferences too.</p><p>对于大多数自我按摩应用，AmazonBasics高密度圆形泡沫辊36〃可以完成这项工作。我们也有不同偏好的选择。</p><p> Virtual reality is still niche, but a growing crop of VR games with a fitness element, like Beat Saber may inspire people to pick up a headset.</p><p>虚拟现实仍然是一个利基市场，但越来越多的带有健身元素的虚拟现实游戏，比如《击败军刀》，可能会激励人们拿起耳机。</p><p> We slept on 15 sleeping pads on five camping trips and found the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite to be the best for backpackers; the Therm-a-Rest LuxuryMap is tops for car campers.</p><p>我们在五次露营旅行中睡在15个睡垫上，发现Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite最适合背包客；Therm-a-Rest LuxuryMap是露营车的顶级配置。</p><p> Working from home with kids isn’t easy.
