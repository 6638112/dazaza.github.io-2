See our  ethics statement.\n Windows 11 is arriving later this year as a  free upgrade for Windows 10 users, but many are discovering that their hardware isn\u2019t compatible. Microsoft has  altered its minimum hardware requirements, and it\u2019s the CPU changes that are most surprising here. Windows 11 will only officially support 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, alongside Apollo Lake and newer Pentium and Celeron processors.\n That potentially rules out millions of existing Windows 10 devices from upgrading to Windows 11 with full support, and even devices like Microsoft\u2019s own Surface Studio 2 which the company is still  selling right now for $3,499. Older devices that aren\u2019t officially supported will be met with a warning during the Windows 11 install that the upgrade is not recommended, but the OS should still install.\n Windows 11 will also only officially support AMD Ryzen 2000 and newer processors, and 2nd Gen or newer EPYC chips. You can find the full list of  supported processors on Microsoft\u2019s site, but here\u2019s the basic breakdown:\n     Originally,  Microsoft noted that CPU generation requirements are a \u201csoft floor\u201d limit for the Windows 11 installer, which should have allowed some older CPUs to be able to install Windows 11 with a warning, but hours after we published this story,  the company updated that page to explicitly require the list of chips above. We\u2019ve reached out to Microsoft to clarify its CPU requirements and support, and we\u2019ll update you accordingly.\n Many Windows 10 users have been downloading Microsoft\u2019s PC Health App ( available here) to see whether Windows 11 works on their systems, only to find it fails the check. As Microsoft now requires a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), this has led to some additional confusion around hardware support.\n That earlier page said Windows 11  would also require TPM capable of at least 1.2 support and UEFI Secure Boot. Both of these technologies are designed to improve the security of Windows, and prevent malware and ransomware from tampering with encryption keys and other secure elements of the operating system. Now, it appears Microsoft may be mandating TPM 2.0, but again, we\u2019re checking on that.\n While Microsoft has required TPM support for OEM hardware certification since Windows 10, it hasn\u2019t actively required Windows to have this fully enabled. That\u2019s changing in Windows 11, and it means if your laptop or PC shipped without these BIOS options enabled then you\u2019re going to have to go searching for a setting to switch on.\n   \u201cAlmost every CPU in the last 5-7 years has a TPM,\u201d  explains David Weston, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft. Weston is recommending that Windows 10 users failing Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 upgrade checker requirements should ensure BIOS options for \u201cPTT\u201d on Intel systems are enabled, or \u201cPSP fTPM\u201d on AMD devices. As every BIOS has different settings, you might need to refer to your laptop\u2019s manual if you\u2019re struggling to find the option.\n If you\u2019ve enabled TPM support but you\u2019re still not passing the Windows 11 upgrade checker, it\u2019s likely because your CPU isn\u2019t on the fully supported list. Intel has confirmed Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 CPU requirements. \u201cA broad range of Intel-based platforms are expected to support Windows 11: 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, as well as Intel Pentium processors and Intel Celeron processors from the \u2018Apollo Lake\u2019 generation and newer,\u201d says an Intel spokesperson in a statement to  The Verge.\n This is the first significant shift in Windows hardware requirements since the release of Windows 8 back in 2012, and the CPU changes are understandably catching people by surprise. Microsoft is also requiring a front-facing camera for all Windows 11 devices except desktop PCs from January 2023 onwards. It\u2019s another change that will shape the hardware that Windows 11 will run on in the coming years.\n Update, 5:45AM ET : Added details about Microsoft\u2019s soft limit for the Windows 11 installer.\n Update, 4:06PM ET:  Added that Microsoft\u2019s compatibility page has now changed, with different CPU and TPM requirements.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:23:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,cpu,list", "title": "Windows\u7528\u6237\u60ca\u8bb6\u4e8eWindows 11\u7684\u652f\u6301CPU\u5217\u8868 ", "title_en": "Windows Users Surprised by Windows 11's Short List of Supported CPUs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "cpu", "list"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8e3ca1ad7620172a416275f2e495f24a.png", "infoid": 1068572, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u7684MWC\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684SmartWatch\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u624b\u8868\u3002\u8be5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c06\u5728\u65b0\u7684WEAR OS\u4e4b\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0eGoogle\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u90a3\u4e9b\u9075\u5faa\u4e09\u661f\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u7559\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u624b\u8868 - \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u548c\u624b\u8868\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u754c\u9762\u611f\u89c9\u66f4\u52a0\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u4eca\u5929\u6240\u770b\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u4f69\u6234\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u65b0UI\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u89c2\u770b\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5e73\u53f0\u4e00\u8d77\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u65b0\u7684Galaxy Watch\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u5f53\u8c37\u6b4c\u5ba3\u5e03\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u4e09\u661f\u5408\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5206\u4eab\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u97e9\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u67d0\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u5982\u53cc\u51fb\u7269\u7406\u6309\u94ae\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5d29\u6e83\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4e8b\u60c5\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5f53\u60a8\u5728\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u60a8\u7684SmartWatch\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5230\u60a8\u7684SmartWatch\u4e0a\u3002\u624b\u673a\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e5f\u5c06\u4fb5\u5165\u624b\u8155 - \u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\uff06\uff0339\u6240\u9009\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u5c06\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u60a8\u5219\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e14ve\u88ab\u5c01\u9501\u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u963b\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u963b\u6b62\u4f60\u7684\u624b\u8868\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u7535\u8bdd\u4e0a\u62ff\u51fa\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u3002\u6839\u636e\u65b0UI\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u624b\u8868\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\uff0339;

This software will run on top of  the new Wear OS, which the company co-developed with Google. Those who follow Samsung closely will remember a version of  One UI already exists for watches \u2014 it&#39;s meant to make the interface between Galaxy phones and watches feel more coherent. From what we saw today, it appears the latest One UI for Wear OS will attempt to do that too. In  a press release, the company said &#34;One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience.&#34;\n When Google announced the latest wearable platform was made in collaboration with Samsung, it shared how it learned from the Korean company how to optimize certain processes for better responsiveness and battery performance. We also saw some changes to navigation, like a double click of a physical button to switch between running apps. But we have yet to get a full breakdown of the updated OS.\n  Today, Samsung showed a few more details on how things will work. For example, when you install compatible apps on your phone, they&#39;ll also be downloaded onto your smartwatch. Settings from your phone will also port over to your wrist \u2014 the various clocks for different cities you&#39;ve picked will show up, while the numbers you&#39;ve blocked will remain blocked. This also works the other way around, so if you block a person from your watch, they&#39;ll also get blacklisted on your Galaxy phones. According to a video of the new UI, the layout of the watch&#39;s Settings menu will also &#34;closely reflect&#34; that on your phone.\n  One of Tizen&#39;s shortcomings was a lack of third-party app support, and with the new Wear OS that opens up a whole new library of titles you can install. One UI Watch will offer the Google Play Store so you can get apps directly from your wearable. Some of the apps this brings include Couch25K, Facer, Adidas, GolfBuddy, Calm, as well as Google&#39;s apps like Maps, Messages, YouTube Music and more.\n Samsung and Google both also said there will be a new watch face design tool for Android developers to create more useful options that better display the data their users want at a glance.\n While this is by no means an exhaustive look at the new Wear OS or One UI Watch, it gives us a better idea of what to expect.

Its most recent publicly disclosed financing was a $27 million Series B in October of 2018.\n Terms of the Discord acquisition weren\u2019t disclosed, though in recent months the startup seemed to abandon most of the products it had spent its first several years building, suggesting that Ubiquity6 had been having some issues finding wide audiences for its products.\n   Launching back in 2017, Ubiquity6 hoped to build an app that would be the central way mobile phone users would browse augmented reality content. In late 2019, the startup  launched a product called Displayland, which aimed to gamify the process of 3D scanning physical environments with a smartphone\u2019s camera.\n The company\u2019s efforts to find mass adoption were hampered by a mobile AR market, which has largely failed to gain any momentum in recent years despite hefty investment from tech giants, including Apple and Google.\n In early 2020, CEO Anjney Midha told TechCrunch that the startup had some 65 employees.\n  In recent months, Ubiquity6 had executed a pretty drastic pivot, leaving augmented reality completely behind in favor of building out a desktop platform that allowed users to play simple online party games together remotely. The beta platform, called  Backyard, was designed for pandemic era habits that seem to be on the decline as the US springs back into action. Backyard was discontinued this week as part of the acquisition announcement.\n In a  Medium post announcing the acquisition, Midha seems to downplay any expectations that Ubiquity6\u2019s augmented reality technology will be living on inside Discord.\n \u201cOur mission at Ubiquity6 has always been to unlock new ways for people to connect through shared experiences,\u201d Midha wrote. \u201cJoining Discord today allows us to accelerate that mission \u2014 Ubiquity6\u2019s team, Backyard product and multiplayer technology will be integrated into Discord.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:22:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u534f\u4f5c,collaborative,\u6536\u8d2d", "title": "Discord\u83b7\u53d6\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u542f\u52a8\u6cdb\u7d20ithiquity6\uff0c\u5b83\u7b79\u96c6\u4e8637.5\u7c73\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u67a2\u8f6c\u6210\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u670d\u52a1 ", "title_en": "Discord acquires augmented reality startup Ubiquity6, which had raised $37.5M and recently pivoted to become a collaborative service for simple online games", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/discord-acquires-augmented-reality-startup-ubiquity6/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6e38\u620f", "\u534f\u4f5c", "\u6536\u8d2d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "558be2d47a7c345a5128f7a0a3f8d302.jpg", "infoid": 1068570, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Coinbase\u5df2\u6536\u5230\u5fb7\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\uff08Bafin\uff09\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6258\u7ba1\u8bb8\u53ef\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e50\u961f\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fd\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5df4\u592b\u6797\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u3002\n Bafin\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0cCoinbase\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u5bb6\u6536\u5230\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n 2019\u5e7411\u6708\uff0c\u5fb7\u56fd\u7684\u8bae\u4f1a - \u8054\u90a6\u8bae\u9662 - \u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fd\u7533\u8bf7\u52a0\u5bc6\u62d8\u7559\u8bb8\u53ef\u6216\u79bb\u5f00\u5fb7\u56fd\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u7533\u8bf7\u3002 2020\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u5728\u8be5\u56fd\u5728\u8be5\u56fd\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u88ab\u8981\u6c42\u5ba3\u5e03\u5176\u76ee\u7684\u7533\u8bf7\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e2a\u5e74\u5ea631\u65e5\u7533\u8bf7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e11\u670830\u65e5\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n \u6279\u51c6\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4e50\u961f\u961f\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u5e02\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u516c\u5f00\u3002\n  \u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u94f8\u9020\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u5df2\u88ab\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4ee5\u505c\u6b62\u5728U.K.\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u7701\u7701\u5916\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u7701\u8bc1\u5238\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff08OSC\uff09\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\n \u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8eCOINDESK\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u540c\u610f\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u548camp;\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u3002\n   COINDESK\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u8d8a\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u653f\u7b56\u3002 COINDESK\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u8425\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002 ", "note_en": "Coinbase has received a crypto custody license from Germany\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), allowing Coinbase to continue serving the German market.

Companies that were already operating in the country on Jan. 1, 2020,  were required to announce their intent to apply by March 31 of that year and apply by Nov. 30.\n The approval comes at a time in which Coinbase is trying to prove itself to be an exchange that embraces regulation after having gone public in the U.S.  via a direct listing in April.\n  At the same time, Coinbase rival Binance has been warned by regulators to stop operating in the  U.K. and  Japan, and has  pulled out of Canada\u2019s Ontario province to avoid scrutiny from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).\n By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our  terms &amp; conditions and  privacy policy.\n   Disclosure The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

"note_en": "Instructure, the company that develops the learning management system Canvas, has filed with the Securities Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, the company announced Monday.\n The private equity firm Thoma Bravo, which focuses on technology companies,  acquired Instructure in March 2020 for $2 billion, removing it from public trade as schools and universities shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic and moved to online learning platforms.\n For the first three months of 2021, Instructure reported  $94 million in revenue and a net loss of $33.1 million. The company\u2019s prospectus asserts that online learning will become a permanent part of education and that federal relief funding will contribute to further investment in edtech.\n \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has created a set of conditions in which students of all ages have been learning remotely for a year, providing an opportunity to demonstrate the efficacy of distance learning at scale and opening up new possibilities for learners who previously could not access quality education,\u201d  the filing reads. \u201cAlmost overnight, schools and universities had to rapidly adopt or redeploy online platforms for students and teachers to conduct lessons remotely. As a result of government stimulus and realigned school and university budget priorities, hardware, software, and internet connectivity began to proliferate in regions and markets with historically low levels of access. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a massive tailwind to adoption over the past year, but the need for ongoing technology in education will persist well beyond the pandemic.\u201d\n Instructure serves more than 6,000 customers worldwide. Its learning management system, Canvas, passed more than 30 million K-12 and university users in 2020, according to the filing.\n Despite the widespread use of Instructure\u2019s technology, executives warn in the prospectus that the company could face significant challenges in the coming months, such as possible reversals of new business initiated during the pandemic.\n \u201cWe have a history of losses, and we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future,\u201d the prospectus reads.\n It lists net losses by Instructure of $80.2 million in 2019 and $200.2 million in 2020.\n The filing says that Instructure, since being acquired, is now focusing primarily on education, citing its sale of Bridge, which catered to corporate learning. Instructure sold Bridge for $50 million, EdSurge reported.\n Since being acquired by Thomas Bravo, Instructure in December acquired Certica Analytics, an education analytics provider.

He said ShipBob had between 1,200 and 1,500 customers on its platform as it entered 2020.

", "note_en": "The round was co-led by Fireside Ventures (a prominent Indian investor in consumer and hardware tech space) and an unnamed global investor, the Indian startup said, without revealing the other firm\u2019s name. HeyDay, PDS International, Class 5 Global, Secocha Ventures, and founders of  hardware startup boAt (Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta) also participated in the round. It\u2019s not clear whether the round also includes debt \u2014 as is popular among Thrasio-like ventures \u2014 and if the entire financing is being wired in one tranche.\n 10club acquires small brands that sell their products on e-commerce platforms and scales those businesses.\n  \u201cGreat businesses are growing on the backs of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa and more. They get their foundational years right but find it difficult to scale, and understand that competition is hard to curb.That\u2019s where we step in, allowing you \u2013 the entrepreneurs \u2013 to enjoy an exit and benefit from years of hard work,\u201d the startup describes on its LinkedIn page.\n 10club is one of a few dozen firms that is  attempting to replicate what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model in India. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. TechCrunch  reported earlier this month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany\u2019s Razor Group to raise capital.\n Pity the folks at Thrasio that must be scratching their heads wondering why they&#39;re getting so many hits/mentions from India.  https://t.co/N9r2JYWCyp\n Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell mid-range to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so under-appreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.\n New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise  consolidated about 6,000 third party sellers on Amazon as of earlier this year.\n \u201cIndia and online-first brands are at the cusp of the next revolution. We, at Fireside, believe that both VC and acquisition driven model will co-exist going forward and can turbocharge the growth of early-stage brands. Together with the team at 10Club, we will be able to drive this change and enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands,\u201d said Vinay Singh, Partner at Fireside Ventures, in a statement. As part of the deal, Singh is also joining 10club\u2019s board.\n Bhavna Suresh, co-founder of 10club and former chief executive of real-estate marketplace Lamudi, said the startup has already built its foundational pillars of the centralized platform and signed letters of intent worth $15 million from several firms and will deploy the fresh capital to operate the new businesses.\n &#34;Thrasio

", "note_en": "Workforce analytics company Visier has secured $154 million CAD ($125 million USD), becoming the latest Canadian tech startup to surpass a $1 billion valuation.\n The all equity, Series E round was sole-sourced from Goldman Sachs Asset Management and brings Visier\u2019s valuation to $1.2 billion CAD ($1 billion USD).\n  An already profitable company with a healthy bottom line, Visier raised the capital after Goldman Sachs expressed interest in helping the startup optimize for companies facing new human resource (HR) challenges coming out of COVID-19.\n Visier is a Vancouver-based startup that offers cloud-based workforce analytics software. Its tech helps companies build programs and plans focused on employee wellness, retention, and more. The startup was founded in 2010 and currently serves around 8,000 customers, including the likes of Adobe, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, and Uber. Visier is available in more than 75 countries.\n It was created by Ryan Wong (CEO), John Schwarz (chairman), Jan Schwarz, and Brett Schwarz. John Schwarz began his career at IBM, later becoming president of Symantec (now NortonLifeLock). He also led Business Objects, which was acquired by SAP. It was there he worked with Wong, who focused on engineering at both Business Objects and SAP after the merger.\n This Series E capital brings Visier\u2019s total funding to date to $270 million CAD ( $219.5 million USD). Visier\u2019s past investors include Summit Partners, Foundation Capital, Adams Street Partners, BYU Cougar Capital, and Sorenson Capital.\n  In addition to the $154 million in primary capital, Goldman Sachs also bought out around $92 million CAD ($75 million USD) from existing investors. CEO Wong declined to disclose the details of that deal.\n \u201cAccess to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,\u201d said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company\u2019s continued growth.\u201d\n Visier plans to use the capital to ensure it can win big in what it sees as a \u201cswift and massive transformation\u201d occurring in the HR space. Visier sees two major trends in the HR sector: an increased demand placed on organizations to \u201cbetter know, care for, and support their employees\u201d and the need for new recruitment strategies as COVID-19 has created a more distributed workforce.\n \u201cWhen the pandemic is over, the surveys are saying that there will be a change in the workforce,\u201d Wong said in an interview. \u201cI think that turnover is as high as between 25 to 40 percent.\u201d\n \u201cI think it will be headline news that companies will finally wake up in the morning and find they [have lost] that percentage of their workforce,\u201d the CEO added. \u201cAnd it is a real problem. [Visier has] been beating that drum, and telling and warning that is coming because of all the data that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n \u201cThis whole returning to work is not going to be smooth sailing,\u201d he lamented.\n  The workforce analytics market Visier operates in is expected to reach $5.97 billion USD globally by 2026.  Reports show a surge in investment in workforce analytics from multinational companies and note the demand for workforce analytics software surged during the pandemic, as companies look for ways to ensure productive and efficient management of the workforce amid remote and hybrid work models.\n Companies have been increasingly announcing new hybrid or remote work models, including Shopify, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, and Salesforce, which declared the  nine to five workday \u201cdead.\u201d\n Wong pointed to how companies being more willing to hire remote workers can create new challenges as much as it creates new opportunities and access to talent.\n \u201cThe whole recruiting and where we hire has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, companies that have a workforce planning or talent strategy on where they recruit and how they actually retain talent and assume the classic way of working [will continue], they will be in shock.\u201d\n In addition to changes brought about by COVID-19, Wong also sees a shift in overall employee culture over the past year, led by social movements. He sees employees demanding more than their employers when it comes to addressing social issues, internally and externally.\n \u201cThe last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n \u201cIn the last 25 years, organizations were very much about profit and loss (P&amp;L),\u201d Wong said. \u201cI think the next 25 years is more than just P&amp;L. It is not acceptable to be just looking at P&amp;L, the social responsibility [expectations] that organizations will put in, by law and by the employee pressure, is very high. The last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n Many companies, especially in the tech space, have seen employees demanding action on diversity and inclusion and holding their employers more accountable for actions across a wide spectrum of issues. A homegrown example is  Shopify, which has faced long-standing criticisms over some of its company policies.\n \u201cThe partnership with Goldman Sachs on the next phase of Visier\u2019s growth underscores the fact that people analytics has become mainstream business practice,\u201d said Visier chairman John Schwarz. \u201cThis investment is key to establishing Visier as the independent global cloud platform for people related business insights.\u201d\n Visier, a company of more than 400 employees, is looking to use part of the funding to grow its own employee base, globally. The startup plans to hire around 100 workers in the next 12 months and may look to create a Toronto base in addition to its Vancouver headquarters.\n One major use for the Goldman capital will be to create a partner ecosystem within Visier\u2019s existing platform. This is something the company had been working on prior to the Series E round but the launch of which has been accelerated by the injection of capital. Visier plans to launch the platform this summer.\n Visier also plans to make acquisitions using its newfound capital, something that has not been part of its strategy in the past.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u52b3\u52a8\u529b,cad,visier", "title": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684Visier\uff0c\u4eceGoldman Sachs\u83b7\u5f9715400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u7cfb\u5217E\uff0c\u4ee51.2\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u4f30\u4ef7 ", "title_en": "Visier, which develops cloud-based workforce analytics software, raises $154M CAD Series E from Goldman Sachs at a $1.2B CAD valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://betakit.com/workforce-analytics-startup-visier-secures-154-million-cad-from-goldman-sachs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b", "cad", "visier"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3c56705dcd8765a269238027d3bed46a.jpg", "infoid": 1068562, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761/\u66fc\u8c376\u670828\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09\n \u6cf0\u56fd\u4fdd\u7687\u515a\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u8096\u514b\u6d1b\u5fb7\uff06\uff0334;

Chuenchoopol told Reuters he and a team of 80 volunteers had created the maps and planned to report everyone named on them to police on accusations of insulting the monarchy.\n A spokesperson for Alphabet&#39;s Google  (GOOGL.O) said by email &#34;the issue is now fixed&#34;, and noted: &#34;We have clear policies about what&#39;s acceptable for user generated My Maps content. We remove user generated maps that violate our policies.&#34;\n A version of one of the maps seen by Reuters included the names and addresses of nearly 500 people, many of them students, together with their photos in university or high school uniforms. It had received over 350,000 views.\n The faces of those named had been covered by black squares with the number 112, in reference to the article under the country&#39;s criminal code which makes insulting or defaming the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n  Songklod said that he and the team of volunteers sought to highlight those they accused of breaking that law.\n &#34;When each of us sees something offensive posted on social media, we put it on the map,&#34; he said. Describing it as a &#34;psychological&#34; warfare operation, Songklod said the aim was to dissuade people from online criticism of the monarchy.\n Youth-led protests that began last year brought unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and calls for its reform both on the streets and online.\n The government did not immediately respond to comment on the removal of the Google Maps or the content they contained.\n Songklod, 54, a retired army captain and prominent right-wing activist, said he considered the operation targeting opponents of the monarchy a &#34;massive success&#34; despite the removal of the maps.\n  Human rights groups and critics of the establishment said the maps included the private data and addresses of hundreds of people and could put them at risk of violence.\n &#34;I started to get panicked messages from young people in Thailand who had been doxxed in a royalist document on Google Maps accusing them of being anti-monarchy,&#34; said Andrew MacGregor Marshall, a Scotland-based critic of the monarchy and one of the earliest to highlight the existence of the maps.\n &#34;It\u2019s clear that young Thai people who just want democracy are facing worsening risks.&#34;\n Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Panu Wongcha-um in Bangkok, additional reporting by Jessie Pang; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alison Williams", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u8868\u793a,removed,\u5730\u56fe", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u540d\u6cf0\u56fd\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u548c\u5730\u5740\u88ab\u6307\u8d23\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u541b\u4e3b\u5236 ", "title_en": "Google says it removed two user-generated maps that listed names and addresses of hundreds of Thai activists accused of opposing the monarchy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-takes-down-maps-targeting-hundreds-thais-accused-opposing-king-2021-06-28/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u8868\u793a", "removed", "\u5730\u56fe"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7aa6ffe3cc64f79984b9637328856626.jpg", "infoid": 1068561, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u521b\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u90a3\u4e9b\u5e93\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u836f\u7269\u9001\u7ed9\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u7528\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4f1e\uff0c\u6216\u77ed\u6682\u7684RTSM\u3002\n \u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79f0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u957f\u671f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\n  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5242\u91cf\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a6\u5929 -

That means randomizing patients into treatment and placebo groups, locating medicines and placebos, keeping the supply of those medicines stocked, and, at least during the pandemic, delivering those medicines to patients. All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of Randomized Trial Supply Management, or RTSM for short.\n Specifically, 4G Clinical\u2019s software, called Prancer, uses natural language processing to take specific requirements needed to manage a clinical trial, which are often written in long, complex documents, and configures them into a platform.\n  The fastest the company has been able to move from a phone call to the first dose in a clinical trial was 6 days \u2013\u00a0a sprint that created the software needed for a COVID-19 study during the pandemic. That was an exceptionally fast case, but in general, 4G Clinical says it can beat standard timelines by considerable margins.\n \u201cMost vendors in the world would say that they are probably, you know, between 10 and 16 weeks from, you know, from the kicking off a study until they can dose a patient,\u201d says Dave Kelleher, a company co-founder. \u201cOur typical timeline is generally four to six weeks post spec signature.\u201d\n Generally, large pharmaceutical companies are capable of creating these trial management systems internally. Small companies, however, may not have the capability to do so. 4G Clinical goal is to provide a service that can be of use to both. 4G Clinical has currently designed systems for over 230 companies \u2013\u00a0though the company would not disclose the specific trials in which its systems are being used.\n  4G clinical is also announcing over $200 million in a growth equity round led by Goldman Sachs. Before Goldman, the primary investment came from Boston-based Schooner Capital and First Analysis, a VC firm out of Chicago.\n Kelleher declined to say what the plans for the round were, other than company has plans to pursue more go-to-market strategies and R&amp;D, and ultimately aims to \u201ctake up as much air\u201d in the eClinical and RTSM space as possible.\n The eClinical market is expected to reach about   $14.7 billion by 2027 . RTSM made up about 17 percent of market share in 2020. With the complexity of clinical trials increasing, and the number of trials growing \u2013\u00a0even after COVID-19 related issues shut many trials down in 2020 \u2013 there may be room for more growth.\n Before COVID-19, there was evidence that the amount of clinical trials had   steadily been increasing . In 2000, there were 2,119 clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. By 2010, 100,208, and by 2020, 362,532 registered by the end of the year (that includes massive slowdowns created by the pandemic for non-COVID research).\n Within that landscape, there is some evidence that sponsors of clinical trials are using more external applications to manage those clinical trials. Of 500 clinical operations professionals respondents   surveyed  by Veeva (another eClinical company, keep in mind) found that 63 percent were using an RTSM system, up from about 43 percent in 2017.\n 4G Clinical, generally, is looking to benefit from the increased public attention to the clinical trials process, and the flexibility that the pandemic has created for sponsors to get creative with clinical trial designs.\n The pandemic did encourage some innovation in this regard. Take, for example, the World Health Organization\u2019s SOLIDARITY trial, which used an adaptive trial design in which multiple drugs could be tested at once. Drugs that showed no promise mid-way through the trial could be dropped (as hydroxychloroquine was in June 2020). The adaptive part, in short, allows for mid-trial tweaks.\n It\u2019s not the traditional design of the gold-standard randomized controlled clinical trial, but it did glean a significant amount of knowledge in a short period of time.   After seven months , three of four drugs tested showed no effect on mortality, whereas the fifth remdesivir, showed some limited promise.\n  Adaptive trial designs weren\u2019t unheard of before the pandemic \u2013\u00a0the FDA had actually released guidance on adaptive clinical trials   in 2019 . But the post-pandemic landscape might encourage more flexibility in this regard, and with it, increase a need for software that can be tweaked to accommodate such changes.\n \u201cI think that we saw some regulatory hurdles reduced as part of this process that allows for more creativity in study design,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cProbably the most important thing for us is our flexibility, we can make changes to studies very rapidly \u2013\u00a0to live studies.\u201d\n 4G Clinical and other RTSM software like it, are looking to hone tools that already exist within clinical trials \u2013\u00a0specifically software used to actually run them. It\u2019s an area of research that the team itself has both a personal stake in, and strong industry knowledge.\n Kelleher was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 23 (a disease to which there is still no definitive cure), and previously founded the Portland-based ACME business consulting. His co-founder Ed Tourtellotte, lost his wife to breast cancer around the same time. Neither have a background in pharmacology, but rather, the team is tackling drug development through streamlining clinical trial software.\n By contrast, other companies aim to streamline clinical trial processes through A.I-based drug target identification, an especially hype-induced area of the space in which investment quadrupled to   $13.9 billion between 2019 and 2020 . Clinical trial management software may seem more mundane, but it\u2019s still an essential part of running Phase III and most Phase II studies.\n Tourtellotte has designed bespoke software systems for major drug developers, including Pfizer\u2019s Impala system (used in 80 percent of Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials for the past 20 years, says Kelleher) and another system Trident, which was sold   to Bioclinica in 2009 \u00a0(along with Tourtoulette\u2019s company, Tourtellotte Solutions). Trident was   utilized by GlaxoSmithKlein  for clinical trials in 2010.\n At this point, the company has declined to confirm a total amount of funding, but in 2020, revenue grew 110 percent with just ten percent of its portfolio focused on COVID-19 related projects.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,goldman,\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c", "title": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7531Goldman Sachs\u63d0\u9ad8200\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "4G Clinical, which develops software to manage clinical trials, raises $200M led by Goldman Sachs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/4g-clinicals-clinical-trial-management-software-attracts-over-200m-in-new-funding/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "goldman", "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d9370be530678a1c667467fa48442d82.jpg", "infoid": 1068560, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ece2019\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74\u52302020\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u4ece405\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5230520\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u589e\u52a0\u4e8628.4\uff05\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 -

This is due, in part, to demand from markets like the Philippines, where the COVID-19 pandemic has forced business closures and quarantines, Sensor Tower noted.\n Consumer spend outside of games was driven by sports, finance, business, book and entertainment apps. Subscription-based apps in the top 100 apps (excluding games) were a large part of this spend, too, contributing $8.3 billion during the period. TikTok remained a top grossing app during the first half of 2021, followed by YouTube and regular top-earner Tinder.\n  Of course, mobile game spending continues to contribute to the largest part of the overall consumer spend, reaching $44.7 billion during the first half of the year. The App Store accounted for $26 billion of that figure, but growth slowed from 26.5% in the year-ago period to 13.5% from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021.\n  Top-grossing games in the first half of 2021 were, in order, Tencent\u2019s Honor of Kings ($15 billion+), PUBG Mobile (including its localized version for China, reached nearly $1.5 billion), Genshin Impact ($848 million+), Roblox and Coin Master.\n Mobile app download growth also significantly slowed in the first half of this year, the firm found.\n Last year, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a surge of new mobile app installs around the world, as consumers looked to apps for work, school, shopping, heath, grocery and more. During the first half of 2020, app installs had jumped 25.7% year over year to reach 71.3 billion downloads. But in the first half of 2021, downloads only grew 1.7% to reach 72.5 billion installs.\n  The App Store even saw a year-over-year decline in nongame installs in the first half of 2021, dropping 10.9% to 16.3 billion from 18.3 billion in the first half of 2020. Sensor Tower believes this is reflective of the increased competition for consumer attention in markets with a high number of iOS users, like the U.S., where businesses have been reopening and in-person activities are resuming.\n Meanwhile, Google Play (nongame) installs climbed 6% in the first half of this year to 56.2 billion from the 53 billion in the first half of 2020. This could be tied to the demand for apps in markets where Android is dominant, like India, which has continued to be impacted by the pandemic. As a result, app adoption on Google Play was 3.5 times higher than on the App Store during the first half of 2021.\n  The (nongame) app with the most downloads was TikTok, which gained 384.6 million new installs during the first half of this year. But this is down by around 38% from the 619 million installs it saw during the year-ago period \u2014 a change that can be attributed to  its ban from the Indian market last year.

However, unlike ClassPass\u2019 BTC model, Gympass partners with employers who then pay a flat fee for the platform (an app) which then allows their employees to choose from several wellbeing plans that give them access to myriad in-person gyms and studios, and a directory of health apps, such as Calm. The offerings are broken up into the following categories: physical health, emotional health, nutrition and sleep.\n According to the company, in May, Gympass saw a record 4 million monthly check-ins across its network of more than 50,000 global partners. In fact, for some of the partners, usage hit above pre-COVID levels.\n  Between increased anxiety rates and documented weight gain during the pandemic, it\u2019s clear that people are eager to get active again with the hopes of improving their mental health and their waistlines.\n GymPass is the brainchild of Cesar Carvalho, a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant in Brazil who was always on the road and yearned for a corporate wellness product that would comply with his hectic work schedule.\n  \u201cSome days I worked from home, other days I worked from the office, and then there was the time I was traveling. I could never go to the gym in one place,\u201d Carvalho told TechCrunch. \u201cI realized that my needs were the same as others,\u201d he said.\n  \u201cI\u2019m one of those crazy entrepreneurs that drops out of their MBA to start a company, but looking back now, it worked out okay,\u201d he said, later telling TechCrunch that Gympass is now in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, the U.S., Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and the U.K.\n Since its launch in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2012, the company achieved product-market fit fairly quickly, and its growth and expansion have been largely organic.\n Originally, Gympass was a BTC concept, and one of its first clients was an executive at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Brazil. He liked the product so much that he eventually said to Carvalho, \u201cCan\u2019t I communicate this to my 5000 employees in all the cities where we have offices in Brazil?\u201d With that question \u2013 and offer \u2013 Carvalho saw the need to pivot and build a B2B company.\n After only three years in Brazil, one of his biggest Brazilian clients asked Carvalho to expand to Mexico, because his company had a large presence there and he wanted to offer Gympass to its employees. And so follows most of the expansion stories.\n \u201cWe expanded to Spain, because we worked with a Spanish bank in Mexico, and they wanted their employees in Spain to have access to our product,\u201d he said.\n This round, which doubles the company\u2019s valuation to $2.2 billion, includes participation from SoftBank, General Atlantic, More Strategic Ventures, Kaszek Ventures and Valor.

The latter fund is in addition, and designed to complement, a  previously unannounced   $2.3 billion global \u201cLeaders\u201d fund that is focused on later-stage investing \u00a0that Accel closed in December.\n  Accel expects to invest in about 20 to 30 companies per fund on average, according to Partner Rich Wong. Its average investment in its growth fund will be in the $50 million to $75 million range, and $75 million and $100 million out of its global Leaders fund.\n But the firm is also still eager and \u201cexcited\u201d to incubate companies, Wong said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll still write $500,000 to $1 million seed checks,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to work with companies from the very beginning and support them through their entire journey.\u201d\n Indeed, as TechCrunch recently reported, Accel has a history of backing companies that were previously bootstrapped (and often profitable) -\u2013 the latest example being  Lower, a Columbus, Ohio-based fintech, which just raised a  $100 million Series A.\n Interestingly, Accel is often referred to some of these companies by existing portfolio companies (also in the case of Lower, whose CEO was referred to Accel by Galileo Clay Wilkes). More often than not, companies that Accel backs out of its early-stage and growth funds are bootstrapped and located outside of Silicon Valley.\n The venture firm has long looked outside of Silicon Valley for opportunities, and has had offices not only in the Bay Area, but in London and Bangalore for years. Part of its investment thesis is to \u201cinvest early and locally,\u201d according to Wong. Examples of this philosophy include investments in companies based all over the world \u2014 from Mexico to Stockholm to Tel Aviv to Munich.\n Since the time of its last fund closure in 2019, the firm has seen 10 portfolio companies go public, including  Slack, Austin-based Bumble, Bucharest-based UiPath, CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, Deliveroo and  Squarespace, among others.\n  It also had 40 companies experience an M&amp;A, including Utah-based Qualtrics\u2019s $8 billion acquisition by SAP and Segment\u2019s $3.2 billion acquisition by Twilio. Also, just last week, Rockwell Automation announced it was   buying Michigan-based Plex Systems  for  $2.22 billion in cash. Accel first invested in Plex, which has developed a subscription-based smart manufacturing platform, in 2012.\n Recent investments include a number of fintech companies such as LatAm\u2019s  Flink, Berlin-based  Trade Republic,  Unit and Robinhood rival  Public. Accel has also backed as existing portfolio companies such as  Webflow, a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites and events startup  Hopin.\n   \u201cFor example, we\u2019ll look at automation companies, consumer businesses and security companies, but at a global scale. Our goal is to find the best entrepreneurs regardless of where they are,\u201d she said.\n That has only been intensified by the recent rise of the smartphone and cloud, Wong said.\n \u201cBefore, companies were mostly selling to the consumer in their own country,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now the size of the market is so dramatically bigger, allowing them to become even larger, which is one of the reasons why I believe we\u2019re seeing investment pace at this speed.\u201d\n To support this, it\u2019s notable that Accel\u2019s global Leaders fund is \u201cdramatically\u201d larger than the $500 million Leaders fund the firm closed in 2019.\n Also, de Rycker points out, companies are staying private longer so the opportunity to invest in them until they sell or go public is greater.\n Accel is also patient. In some cases, the firm\u2019s investors will develop \u201cyears-long\u201d relationships with companies they are courting.\n \u201c1Password is an example of this approach,\u201d Wong said. \u201cArun [Mathew] had that relationship for at least six years before that investment was made. Finally, 1Password called and said \u2018We\u2019re ready, and we want you to do it.\u2019 \u201d\n And so Accel led the Canadian company\u2019s first external round of funding in its 14-year history \u2014  a $200 million Series A \u2014 in 2019.\n While the firm is open-minded, there are still some industries it has not yet embraced as much as others. For example, Wong said, \u201cWe\u2019re not announcing a $2.2 billion crypto fund, but we have done crypto investments, and see some very interesting trends there. We\u2019ll look at where crypto takes us.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:18:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u9636\u6bb5,stage", "title": "Accel\u5ba3\u5e03\u7b2c\u5341\u4e94\u6b21\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u4e03\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e03\u5c4a\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u57fa\u91d1\u4e3a6.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7b2c\u516d\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u589e\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u91d1\u4e3a1.75\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "Accel announces fifteenth early-stage US fund at $650M, seventh early-stage European and Israeli fund at $650M, and sixth global growth stage fund at $1.75B", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/accel-closes-on-3b-across-three-funds/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u9636\u6bb5", "stage"]}]
