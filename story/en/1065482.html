Would you believe that I clicked into the &#34;General Discussion&#34; forum, a subforum on this site I almost never visit, specifically to post my own rant on this  very topic?  The internet is dead. Whatever this thing is, it isn&#39;t the internet. It&#39;s just a bunch of billboards and propaganda.  I give wikipedia two more years -- at most -- before it has to sell and move to a profit-earning model.  The Wild West metaphor is appropriate. We used to be able to do whatever we wanted. And since the internet and its culture was built by nerds and geeks, the content of the internet was built around geek culture. Special interest sites  everywhere. And, everywhere, a general anti-&#34;the-man&#34; ethos. But Web 2.0 effed that up completely. When boards like this one moved off Usenet and onto website, it created two separate internets -- the &#34;above board&#34; internet for the plebs, and the original internet underneath it. As usual, the plebs are too numerous, and their internet has completely overshadowed the internet I knew and helped make in my own little corner of it.  With the plebs online, we skipped gentrification and moved directly into turning the internet into a suburban bedroom community for the corporate sheeple. And  god is it   awful.  Like it or lump it, even PC users should be Mac users these days. With a Mac, you buy an entire interface system that defines how you do and use almost everything. Windows, to become successful again, is shifting themselves into a different version of the Mac environment. The old days of the internet basically required you to be a PC/Windows user (or whatever other OS you&#39;d like, cuz they were easy to find, half of them were free... And all the shell mods... remember the shell mods?). Everything was customizable. The state of your hardware rig was far more important than your social media profile.  Remember when Quake 3: Arena came out and you HAD to buy your 3D graphics card to play it? That was a huge move. Took Mac forever to catch up to that development. I had three Voodoo IIs linked through SLI. Man, those explosions were beautiful. More FPS than my monitor could even show!!! And the gamer mod culture was  everything. I still want to slap the idiots who think TF1 was for Half Life.  I went online in 1994, age 13, with the first public ISP offered where I grew up. Most of the sites I visited were text-only at that time. IRC was about the most fun you could have until we got Doom a few months later and my neighbour and I started fighting each other from across the street. 14.4 modem -- booyah! By 15, I had authored numerous Geocites pages (some of which used to be stashed on the WayBack Machine, but are no longer there :&#39;( ).  I was a member of webrings, and a huge Usenet poster in fan sites. I still have the personal email addresses of several celebrities I used to talk to in Usenet.  Remember ripping  Syndicate from a Usenet binary, the builder spreading it across like eleven 3.5&#34; floppies? Then selling copies at school? Mwaa haa haaaaaaa.  In Nova Scotia, where I grew up, the ISP mPoweredPC started up in the mid 90s, offering 10mbps service over aDSL. (We used to run FTP servers for our entire Napster libraries and all of our warez. [When&#39;s the last time someone knew what the word &#34;warez&#34; meant?]) A few years later, a Bell spin off, Aliant, bought them out and offered 1mbps aDSL service for three times the price, with a bandwidth limit.  That was the beginning of the end. In the ENRON days, some douchebag noticed that you could price bandwidth as a free market commodity like ENRON had done with energy. Whichever politico OKed that is the one who effed us all.  Imagine if you could only flush your toilet 4 times in one day, because that&#39;s the service package you could afford.    That decision paved the way for DPI (deep packet inspection), which is what killed torrenting, and all the other traffic shaping policies ISPs now use. Forget SOPA; the end started much earlier.  When Google was new, it was truly a revelation. Hotbot was my fave before that. Metacrawler was pretty sweet when it launched. Now, the only old-school search engine left is Webcrawler, which, believe it or not, I now use more often than Google when searching for research because you can  actually find what you&#39;re looking for with it.  Seriously, try it out. The web it shows you is much, much nicer than the one Google, Bing, Yahoo, or DuckDuckGo shows you. Webcrawler still searches by keyword, not page rank, so is now often (hilariously) more accurate at finding what you&#39;re looking for than Google. Google&#39;s first several pages of results are now prioritized by their ad revenue probability.  Of all the legislation that needs to be passed, we need a rule to ensure that Google Search (and it&#39;s ilk) is defined properly as what it is really is -- a directory. A phonebook should not be allowed to filter your query by its income-earning potential. Or, someone needs to start a searchable directory that runs like a phonebook and is public (Trudeau? Musk? Do you guys read this? I&#39;m fairly certain Elon Musk used to be [or still is] an SFFWorld user, btw).  I miss the internet. I also miss the free time I used to have as a student, though, so it&#39;s possible the internet is still healthy -- just in some place the 40-year-old version of myself is no longer hip enough to access. But I did the whole dark web thing, tried mining bitcoin (what a pointless endeavour that was), and I&#39;m pretty sure the true internet is simply vanishing because all of us old fogeys stopped maintaining it. Or we were herded out by the all fanboys and instagram users looking for a provided platform.  The news that Apple is looking to deploy technology that takes Apple devices onto an entirely separate internet structure from the main body of the internet&#39;s architecture is actually the best news I&#39;ve heard in years. Hopefully now the digital ecosystems move off the internet proper, which may end their normalizing and centralizing functions that are subsuming the internet.  The entire nature of the internet is now to generate ad revenue and user data revenue -- period, the end. Even Google News and Apple News are little more than clickbait RSS feeds. AWS owns most of the internet&#39;s spine and flesh and profits off almost every move anyone makes online.  These are some good stats:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernar...wing-stats-everyone-should-read/#4503143e60ba  I was looking for an article (which, of course, I can&#39;t find, because ad revenue largely requires novel views, these days) that I had read before that showed how an AP news article, once published to the 6 major newspaper sites, is turned into an additional 2000 webpages of content within an hour by content copying bots. Headlines get modified to be more controversial. And the clickbait cycle goes on.  I miss Winamp. I miss ICQ (I was 3101074). I miss QuakeSpy. I miss mIRC. I miss 7zip. I miss the original torrent client. I miss pbem AD&#39;n&#39;D campaigns (2nd Edition -- the only one that matters). I miss ASCII graphics. I miss webzines. I miss the Weezer video on the Windows 95 CD. Hell, I miss CDs.  Really, I miss the innocence and the creativity. And more than that, I miss having a place where everyone was probably like me. I miss the geeks. The internet was a place unlike any other. This new things looks like the internet, but it&#39;s really just a shopping mall built for the popular kids.  (I&#39;m sure someone about 10-15 years older than me thinks the things I am lamenting are the things that killed  their internet. Sorry about that.)</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sffworld.com/forum/threads/i-miss-the-old-internet.57195/">https://www.sffworld.com/forum/threads/i-miss-the-old-internet.57195/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/念旧/">#念旧</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/internet/">#internet</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
