", "note_en": "I can no longer feel the top of my head. Apparently it takes 3-5 months to regain sensation up there, and some people never get the feeling back. Oh well, what do you need to feel things from the top of your head for anyway?\n But, it\u2019s truly bizarre touching the top of my head and only getting feedback from my hand. Almost like touching someone else\u2019s head except my brain knows where my hand is and seems to get confused, as if it doesn\u2019t know how to close the loop. Proof I guess of just how connected the body and the mind are.\n Anyway, you probably want to know, what its like? What does it feel like to be awake while someone is drilling deep inside your head? Well, let me walk you through it as best as I can.\n  The day began by getting this lovely looking frame bolted onto my skull. It didn\u2019t feel as bad as it looks. They froze the areas where the bolts go so other than the weight and some added pressure around my skull I couldn\u2019t really feel it. But, after they turned me into a cartoon supervillain, I learned that an emergency case had come in that would delay my surgery by an hour or two. So, I sat there in the cramped pre-op room staring at the other patients who were doing their best not to look horrified when we made eye contact.\n Eventually I got wheeled into the OR. Like a guest of honor there were many onlookers waiting for me when I got there. In addition to the surgical team itself of at least 7 or 8 people, there were a couple rows of students who had come to watch and learn.\n First I was laid out on the table and had the frame locked into a much larger contraption that would keep my head securely in place no matter how much I wriggled and writhed about. Then there was about half an hour of prep that the team did in a flurry of activity happening all around me. During which time my hair was cut, but only the parts that might get in the way of the procedure, giving me that classically handsome friar tuck look. Then all sorts of sterilizing ointments were applied. Between that, the oxygen, and the mild sedatives I was given it was almost starting to feel like a trip to a spa.\n    Throughout the morning I had felt very ready for what I was about to experience. I\u2019m not sure exactly what to attribute that to, but in the days preceding it my mind was completely at ease with what I was about to experience. One fear I thought I might have going in was that I would start to doubt the decision I had made.  As I wrote before, DBS was not the only option available to me. What if I got into the OR and started to second guess myself? Thankfully I never paid the thought much attention. Part of it was that I knew I was in great hands, Dr. Suneil Kalia and his team at Toronto Western Hospital are as good as it gets. It also helped that I knew I had done my homework.\n Four years earlier on a Friday morning in Jerusalem I was wandering the halls of Hadassah medical center looking for Prof. Hagai Bergman. Friday is the start of Shabbat, the day of rest when all of Jerusalem shuts down. I wandered through the empty halls of his building wondering if I had come at the wrong time, but there he was and he seemed anxious to see me.\n He ushered me into his office and spent the next three hours taking me on a guided private tour of the basal ganglia as well as a new therapy that he was helping make a reality \u2013 closed loop deep brain stimulation. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time but he was showing me my future.\n He also recommended to me a pair of books,  The Mind\u2019s I and  I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. I\u2019ve had them close to me ever since and often return to them. I haven\u2019t read anything else that comes as close to explaining who and what we are, why we experience what we experience, and why we think the thoughts that we think. Some say we have no idea how DBS, or the brain for that matter, works. But, if closed loop DBS is successful, I think it would prove that while we may not ever know all the details, we do already have the right conceptual framework. We are a collection of strange loops and most of the neurological problems we face can be attributed to a break in one or more of those loops. Find the right loop or loops to close and we can fix just about anything that goes wrong.\n I haven\u2019t spoken to Prof. Bergman since, but will forever be grateful for those three hours he spent patiently explaining this new technique that I will soon be turning on inside my own head to me. Here is a taste of that lecture he gave me.\n    I\u2019ll have much more to say on closed loop DBS in the future. Back to the OR.\n Now, as much as I believed I was ready for what I was about to experience, nothing can really prepare you for what it is\u00a0like to be awake during it all. Every detail of that morning has been indelibly etched into my memory, yet I struggle to find the words to describe it. Language isn\u2019t really suited for such things and whatever words I\u2019ll choose to use won\u2019t really be able to capture it. Such is life I guess.\n I\u2019ll start with the pain, which there really isn\u2019t that much of. The only thing that really really hurt were all the needles used to freeze my scalp, after that I didn\u2019t really feel anything. So I was a little surprised when after the freezing they told me that they were ready to start drilling through my skull, meaning they had already sliced through all the various layers of my scalp.\n  Next came the drilling of the bore holes. If there is any part of this procedure that is likely to induce trauma it is this. I will never forget that sound. Usually sound is created by your ear picking up tiny vibrations of particles in the air. But in this case the sound comes more from your entire skull shaking violently to the rotating drill boring a hole through your head. I didn\u2019t hear it as much as I felt it, as if the entire universe was grinding together inside my skull.\n Once the brain is exposed the team covered themselves and me in protective gear so they can turn on the giant stereotactic imaging device that guides the surgeon through my brain deep into my subthalamic nucleus. All of that is displayed on a screen in front of you allowing yourself and the team to see everything happening in real time. This goes by surprisingly quickly and was somewhat uneventful, though I do remembered some murmured remarks between the surgeons about avoiding a particular vein somewhere along the way.\n I did wonder, what would it be like if something went wrong. What would the reactions of the surgeons have been if they tripped that vein? All through the procedure the team sounded very calm and business like. Would the tone of their words suddenly have turned to panic? And what would I experience? Would the world suddenly go dark? Would my conscious awareness and this chain of experience I call my self suddenly shift to something else?\n Anyway, once it looks like it is in the right spot, which you can tell by the lead penetrating the crosshairs on the screen, they began the microelectrode recording. They played the live sound on a speaker which emitted the different sounds of each cortical layer as it went deeper and deeper. Throughout the procedure I was talking and lucid. Lobbing question after question at the team, here Dr. Kalia had to tell me to shut up so they could listen and confirm they were in the right spot.\n The crescendo slowly builds until it reaches the target and then the sound of hundreds of thousands of your own neurons excitedly relaying the information they carry to one another fills the room. This was the most intimate moment of the day. My brain was speaking to me, though in a language \u201cI\u201d could not understand. And even though I knew there was some perturbation in that sound that was responsible for the symptoms I felt, I smiled thinking of all that was going right inside me.\n     Once they confirmed they were in the desired position the stimulation was turned on. It was in the left hemisphere of my brain which controls the right side of my body. I was asked to do a few simple movement tasks with my hands like tapping my index finger and thumb together as quickly as possible and pretending to turn a doorknob. It was roughly noon and I had not taken any medication up to that point. Normally if I had gone till noon without any medication I would have had a pronounced tremor, the tapping would have been very slow and labored, and I would have barely been able to turn my wrist over and back. But at that moment I felt as though I had travelled back in time eight years to before my diagnosis. My fingers and my wrist moved fluidly. It was liberating. I was back in control. Despite being strapped to a table with my head in a giant vice I felt euphoric. This disease had suddenly and magically dissipated. Nothing short of a modern medical miracle.\n But it was short lived as I was then reminded that the entire process needed to be repeated for the other side. Now the novelty of the whole experience wore off and I started to really feel the weight of the frame tying me down. I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth and got through it. But not without the whole thing taking its toll. A mix of nausea and a shearing headache crept over me that slowly grew in intensity. I wanted to tell them not to bother with getting this side as precise as possible, to just hurry up and get it all over with as quickly as they could.\n There is a lot more I could say about the whole ordeal, including the tunneling of the wires through my neck and the placement of the battery in my chest two days later, but I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. It has been 12 days since the operation and I am feeling much better than I would have expected, though not entirely like myself either. In less than a month I should begin programming the device which hopefully will make everything I experienced worthwhile. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019ll do if, once we get all the parameters right, they flick that switch and I get to permanently return to that state I felt when they turned on the stimulation in the OR, but suffice it to say that I am looking forward to getting there.\n The last thing I\u2019ll show is the MRI I had taken the day after. The white dots you see on the left is the inflammation surrounding the holes that were drilled. I close my eyes and wonder how all the cells surrounding that spot must be reacting, all the neurons trying to communicate with this foreign object, all the glial cells now busily forming the scar tissue that will lock those long leads you see on the right in place for the rest of my life.\n  Soon enough the stimulator will be turned on and the contacts will be activated, hopefully restoring mobility to this strange loop that I am.\n   I am very pleased that your operation appears to have gone welll; You will be looking foreward to switching it on no doubt. Keith\n    As usual. Great post! You are an inspiration and good luck turning on the juice soon, best wishes, Frank\n  This was a fascinating post to read as a neurosurgery resident. Thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope DBS works out for you.\n  The human body is an incredible, complex, designed piece of artistry. May you go forth with renewed joy and gratefulness for this wonderful second chance of life.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:47:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6027\u8111,awake", "title": "\u5728\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u8111\u624b\u672f\u671f\u95f4\u9192\u6765\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48 ", "title_en": "What it felt like to be awake during invasive brain surgery", "transed": 1, "url": "https://tmrwedition.com/2021/06/13/the-agony-and-the-ecstacy-of-deep-brain-stimulation-surgery/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u8111", "awake"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "080e3b0db1f05ffd1aed9f27aaae1e92.png", "infoid": 1067294, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8ba9\u6211\u6f84\u6e05\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1a\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u7edd\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u5bf9\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n \u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff06\uff0339;\u51c6\u200b\u200b\u786e\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u4f60\u7684\u5c04\u51fb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u505a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u5e76\u88ab\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u59d3\u540d\u548c\u7f9e\u8fb1\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u91d1\u878d\u90e8\u95e8\u3002\u6211\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u8d8a\u8fc7\u8db3\u591f\u7684Shitbags\u7684\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4ed6\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u591f\u4e86\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\u4f1a\u8ba9\u6211\u53bb\u878d\u8d44\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339;\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u5728\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\u89d2\u843d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u5728\u6211\u7684\u7b80\u5386\u4e2d\u611a\u8822\u3002\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u91ccand\uff0339;

You tried to do the right thing and got crapped on for it. For that, name and shame all you like. Welcome to the financial sector. I crossed paths with enough shitbags from there and enough of their fuckery early enough in my career that no amount of money will make me go anywhere near finance  ever. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not qualified to work in that corner of the industry, I just don&#39;t want the stink of it on my resume. Not that there aren&#39;t shitbags elsewhere; finance just seems to attract more of them. Let the downvoting begin.\n LoanStreet either intentionally deceived me or accidentally deceived me but have since refused to make it right by fulfilling what a reasonable person would consider to be the promise they made me.\n This is where you&#39;re wrong. Hear me out before you start going on again about how I&#39;m one of Ian Lampl&#39;s robot minions. Beep boop.\n Contracts exist because of exactly the thing you think is the problem: somebody failed to do &#34;the right thing.&#34; The guy who got screwed as a result decided it would be a good idea to put &#34;the right thing&#34; in writing and get both parties to say they&#39;re okay it before doing anything else. You keep going on about what&#39;s true and moral; the contract  is the truth and the moral standard, full stop.\n If you dig through the agreement you signed, there&#39;s very likely a paragraph like this one, taken verbatim from one I signed:\n Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire contract between the parties heretowith regard to the subject matter hereof and supersede any other agreements, representations orunderstandings (whether oral or written and whether express or implied) which relate to the subject matterhereof.\n Here&#39;s the point I&#39;m trying to drive home: Your signature on that agreement is your word that you&#39;re okay with your options being granted at the next board meeting after you started, not having any of them vest for twelve months afterward and that anything you were told outside the agreement being meaningless.\n Let me repeat that:  You gave them your word that you were okay with this.\n Those &#34;reasonable people&#34; you cited would expect you to not go back on your word because things didn&#39;t turn out in your favor. As far as your options are concerned, LoanStreet held up its end of that bargain by granting you the options it promised. You weren&#39;t there long enough for them to vest. If LoanStreet came to you demanding your cat, every sock you own and three pounds of cheese, you&#39;d tell them to jump in the East River because you don&#39;t owe them that. How moral or reasonable is it of you to expect that they be held to a standard to which they didn&#39;t agree?\n  Yes, there was, and it wasn&#39;t because of any crafty language in the offer. The information imbalance existed before you accepted their offer. You had the leverage of being able to walk away from the negotiation if they didn&#39;t rectify it. It&#39;s easy: you say &#34;I can&#39;t consider accepting your offer until I have the missing documents.&#34; Not only did you not use that leverage, you gave it up entirely by accepting. That&#39;s a classic rookie negotiating mistake. Fortunately, this one didn&#39;t cost you anything.\n  Word to the wise on that stuff: It doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re speaking of. Posting on Reddit is making a public statement, and you&#39;ve said more than enough for LoanStreet to identify you. You also said Lampl defrauded you of $100,000. That&#39;s an accusation you&#39;re unlikely to be able to prove.\n A lot of companies pay a service to keep an eye out for mentions; if they&#39;re one of them, this could end up on their general counsel&#39;s desk. This post is already  at the top of the Google results for their name on Reddit. Had I not mentioned it, what you said would have stood as-posted. Backpedaling may not even matter. Defending yourself against a suit will hurt you a lot more than filing it will hurt them; that&#39;s where the real imbalance lies. You might also explore whether or not you signed anything that forbids disparaging the company and, if so, whether or not it&#39;s still in force. They could get a judgment against you on that with less effort than libel.\n Wow, that got long. Look, I&#39;m sorry you lost your job, but what you&#39;re doing with this isn&#39;t productive and isn&#39;t going to make your life any better. Go have a couple of beers, learn from your mistake and move on to whatever&#39;s next.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:47:09", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ebd\u7ea6,loanstreet", "title": "\u59d3\u540d\u548c\u7f9e\u803b\uff1aLoanstreet\uff08\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff09\u6b3a\u9a97\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u80a1\u6743 ", "title_en": "Name and Shame: LoanStreet (NY) cheated me out of equity", "transed": 1, "url": "https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/o3jpfc/name_and_shame_loanstreet_ny_cheated_me_out_of/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ebd\u7ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "78dee1329ebee87973ad40dd283d7df2.jpg", "infoid": 1067293, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9999\u6e2f\uff06\uff0339;\u82f9\u679c\u6bcf\u5929\u6700\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u4eb2\u6c11\u4e3b\u62a5\u7eb8\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u7a81\u88ad\u4e86\uff0c\u5176\u9ad8\u7ba1\u902e\u6355\u4e86\uff0c\u5176\u8d44\u4ea7\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5929\u4e2d\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9a91kn\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u6bcf\u65e5\u82f9\u679c\uff06\uff0339;\u57282019\u5e74\u7684\u53cd\u5f15\u6e21\u6297\u8bae\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u5929\u5b89\u95e8\u5927\u5c60\u6740\u5b88\u591c\u7684\u6811\u6728\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u5929\u5185\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5371\u9669\u3002\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f52\u6863\u7684noob\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u6211\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c06\u5176\u5907\u4efd\u5230Wayback\u673a\u5668\u3002\n   \u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2aPayWall\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f2\u7ebf\u662f\u7528cookie\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7684\u3002\u5728\u6211\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4ePayWall\u5e76\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cdWGet\u6216Curl\u7b49\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528GoogleBot\uff06\uff0339; s\u7528\u6237\u4ee3\u7406\uff1a\n   \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u4ecd\u7136\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u51fb\u4e2d\u4ed8\u8d39\u5899\uff0c\u8bf7\u7ee7\u7eed\u4fdd\u5b58\u3002 PayWall\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eJavaScript\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5185\u5bb9\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\n  \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fed\u4ee3\u65e5\u671f\u3002\u8bf7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u86512019\u5e742\u6708\u81f3\u4eca\u3002\n \u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u5168\u786e\u5b9a\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u6293\u53d6\u7f51\u7ad9\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u4e3b\u610f\u3002\n \u8bb8\u591a\u6587\u7ae0\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46YouTube-DL\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\uff06\uff0339; m\u8131\u79bb\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5f97\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\n    \u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8be5\u9891\u9053\u5305\u542b\u8bb8\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684Livestreams\u3002\u90a3\u4e9b\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u6297\u8bae\u6d3b\u52a8\u524d\u7ebf\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u5f55\u97f3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\uff06\uff0339;\u62b1\u6b49\u3002 \n\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u4f60\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002 \u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u6211\u8981\u628a\u6240\u6709\u7684\u9999\u6e2f\u90fd\u5927\u5174\u3002  P.S.:1\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6218\u6597\u5f52\u6863\u76d2\uff0c\u65e0\u6d4e\u4e8e\u4e8b\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u53cb\u597d\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u8bf7\u8bc4\u8bba\u8c22\u8c22\u3002 ", "note_en": "Hong Kong&#39;s most-read pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily,  has had its office raided, its executives arrested, its assets frozen in the last few days.

Grab your handlinks and step into the imaging chamber because it&#39;s time to talk about  Quantum Leap. We were lucky enough to snag some time with legendary TV producer  Donald P. Bellisario, whose name has graced the closing credits of some of the most influential and popular TV shows of the &#39;80s and &#39;90s\u2014including   Airwolf,  Magnum, P.I., and of course  Quantum Leap. Though he&#39;s now retired, Bellisario gamely agreed to allow an Ars film crew\u2014with props!\u2014into his California home to badger him with occasionally obscure questions about what is easily the best time-travel show ever to grace television.\n This was a special episode to film, if for no other reason than that  Quantum Leap was a special show. Today it feels like a relic from another age\u2014an age in which story serialization was the exception rather than the rule, where twenty-two episodes per season represented the expected minimum, and where commercial breaks were a bit less frequent. (The first-season episodes of  Quantum Leap clock in at almost  forty-eight minutes\u2014that&#39;s about six minutes longer than most hour-long dramas on network TV today!)  Quantum Leap&#39;s 97 episodes originally aired from 1989 to 1993, and the show was a huge part of my junior high and early high school experience\u2014though the parts of the show I wanted to see most were those rare glimpses into &#34;the future,&#34; the show&#39;s infrequently glimpsed vision of 1999 where Project Quantum Leap was taking place.\n    And what a future it was\u2014a future of neon and blinking lights, of cool blue lightning arcing across colored plastic, of &#39;90s retro-future fashion sense run amok, all overseen by an intelligent and somewhat snippy artificial intelligence named Ziggy. The time travel stories of the week were cool, but the overarching narrative about Project Quantum Leap is what really hooked me\u2014would Sam ever return home?\n Though there have been rumors floating around for years about a   Quantum Leap reboot, I want to temper expectations a bit: Don had a lot of neat stuff to tell us, but one thing you will not find in this interview is any discussion of whether or not  Quantum Leap will be coming back. It is Don&#39;s firm belief that Sam is still out there leaping\u2014and Sam has somehow made the conscious choice to continue doing it. It is, as Don puts it, Sam&#39;s life&#39;s work.\n So the heartbreaking ending of the series finale still stands: Sam Beckett never makes it back to his retro-neon 1999 home, and he&#39;s still out there somewhere, working with Al, striving to put right what once went wrong.\n I&#39;m hopeful that we&#39;ll be able to do at least one more episode of &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; with Don\u2014 Airwolf, anyone? Stay tuned!\n  Slipping out of long time lurker mode to comment. Thank you for this interview Lee! I could have listened to Don talk for hours. Hopefully your interview helps to introduce a new audience to the show -- great stories and memories for me.\n Don was so nice\u2014and  super accommodating. We shot this at his house, and the film crew rolled up there with this giant Ziggy table that we built (it&#39;s nice having a budget sometimes!), and rather than telling us to GTFO, he said we could set up anywhere we wanted. We fought through connection issues (the producer and I were both dialed in on Zoom, so when Don is looking down and to his left, he&#39;s looking at me and Adam asking him questions on an iPad) and COVID precautions, and the end result was great. He was such a good sport.

", "note_en": "Some Texas residents who opted into programs that remotely raise thermostat temperatures during heat waves regretted that decision last week.\n Power companies in multiple states offer promotions to enroll users into services that let the companies remotely adjust smart thermostats&#39; temperatures by a few degrees when energy demand is high. These programs apparently worked as intended during a heat wave in which the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)  requested that thermostats be set at 78\u00b0F (26\u00b0C) or higher to  cut electricity use. But some residents who didn&#39;t realize what they&#39;d signed up for were taken by surprise, according to local news reports.\n Deer Park resident Brandon English said his wife and their daughters, including a 3-month-old, &#34;woke up sweating&#34; after an afternoon nap during which their thermostat had been remotely raised to 78\u00b0, according to a  KHOU story on Thursday. English said he unenrolled the family&#39;s thermostat from the program after discovering that it was being operated remotely.\n &#34;I wouldn&#39;t want anybody else controlling my things for me... If somebody else can manipulate this, I&#39;m not for it,&#34; he said, according to KHOU.\n Karen Rogers of Galveston also apparently didn&#39;t realize that her family had signed up for a remote temperature-change program. After the family&#39;s home &#34;became noticeably hot and uncomfortable,&#34; Rogers said she &#34;found an activity log, and it said that a saving event was initiated by the utility company,&#34;  according to KPRC. She said she then opted out of the program, KPRC wrote.\n In addition to making remote changes because of heat waves, a power company called CenterPoint Energy said it also conducts twice-yearly tests that raise homes&#39; temperatures for three hours at a time. CenterPoint said it conducted one such test on Wednesday last week, which happened to be during a stretch of very hot days. But the main purpose of these programs is to lower electricity use during extreme weather.\n     Rogers was apparently enrolled in a service run by a New York-based company called  EnergyHub, which contracts with thermostat makers and power companies. The company&#39;s  system can remotely change the temperature by up to 4\u00b0F (2.2\u00b0C), and EnergyHub estimates that in Texas, &#34;there will be two to eight adjustment events from June 1st through September 30, 2021.&#34;\n &#34;By participating in the Program, you agree to allow EnergyHub, Inc. and your thermostat provider to remotely access your thermostat to make brief, limited adjustments to your thermostat temperature setting at times of peak electricity demand in the summer. You may benefit by seeing a reduced electricity bill,&#34; the EnergyHub website says. Customers &#34;can opt out from your thermostat, mobile device, or web app simply by resetting your thermostat setting to any temperature that you desire.&#34;\n EnergyHub works with  Nest, Ecobee, and other thermostats, and the company has deals with about 50 utilities nationwide. &#34;Your utility may pay you for using your smart thermostat to create a smarter electric grid. See if a program is available in your area and start earning rewards today,&#34; EnergyHub&#39;s &#34;Enroll my thermostat&#34;  page says.\n One EnergyHub deal offers entries into a $5,000 sweepstakes in exchange for enrolling, but that isn&#39;t the only method for signing up customers.\n &#34;Thermostat owners typically get an offer to participate in the program from their device manufacturer or energy provider via mobile app or email, [EnergyHub VP of customer solutions Erika] Diamond said, and &#39;every participant actively agrees to the terms of the program and can opt out of a demand-response event at any time,&#39;&#34;  according to Business Insider.\n  Houston-area residents complained about the remote temperature changes in a  Reddit thread. While one person wrote, &#34;This sounds like what happens when you get the subsidized thermostat,&#34; others said it happened to them despite purchasing a smart thermostat on their own. &#34;I have a Nest, self purchased, did not sign up for any type of energy saving program or anything,&#34; one person wrote.\n    &#34;My Ecobee that I purchased from Amazon automatically enrolled us in Eco+ feature set which has a setting called &#39;Community Energy Savings&#39; which we could not turn off,&#34; another person wrote. &#34;It would randomly adjust our thermostat based on directives from ERCOT. It took Ecobee months to unenroll us from the program. We almost went back to a simple dumb thermostat because it took them so long to fix it.&#34;\n The thread included some debate over whether these users had been automatically enrolled or opted in themselves without reading the details. Companies that operate these programs say that users must provide their consent.\n Ecobee partners with utilities for its  Community Energy Savings\u00a0program that does remote temperature changes. Ecobee  says the process in which a user enables Community Energy Savings includes selecting the user&#39;s utility provider from a list, viewing an offer from the provider, and then clicking &#34;OK&#34; to enroll.\n Community Energy Savings is part of Ecobee&#39;s Eco+ program, which includes several other features. &#34;Eco+ cannot be disabled entirely once you have enrolled in a program. However, you can still disable it for the day or for the week. Eco+ can be disabled permanently only if you unenroll from the program by contacting your utility or its program manager,&#34; Ecobee says.\n  EnergyHub makes its remote thermostat changes at the direction of power companies. &#34;When CenterPoint Energy, or another utility, initiates a curtailment event based on high temperatures or high demand, EnergyHub then starts the energy curtailment through the customers it has enrolled in its program,&#34;  CenterPoint Energy told KPRC last week.\n In some cases, this is conducted as part of a test rather than due to an extreme weather event.\u00a0CenterPoint Energy said it conducts &#34;a test curtailment event&#34; twice per year and that the most recent occurred on Wednesday, June 16 from 2 pm to 5 pm local time. CenterPoint Energy said it offers energy-efficiency programs through third-party service providers because &#34;Texas law prevents us from offering programs directly to residential customers.&#34;\n San Antonio-based CPS Energy, meanwhile, offers a one-time bill credit of $85 per thermostat when customers enroll in its program,  saying that &#34;[d]uring summer peak energy demand days, we may briefly adjust your thermostat settings by a few degrees... You can opt out of participating in a peak demand event by manually adjusting your thermostat or through your thermostat&#39;s app.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:06:10", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "There\u2019s a bug in iOS that disables Wi-Fi connectivity when devices join a network that uses a booby-trapped name, a researcher disclosed over the weekend.\n By connecting to a Wi-Fi network that uses the  SSID \u201c%p%s%s%s%s%n\u201d (quotation marks not included), iPhones and iPads lose the ability to join that network or any other networks going forward, reverse engineer Carl Schou  reported on Twitter.\n After joining my personal WiFi with the SSID \u201c%p%s%s%s%s%n\u201d, my iPhone permanently disabled it\u2019s WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~)  pic.twitter.com/2eue90JFu3\n\u2014 Carl Schou (@vm_call)  June 18, 2021\n    Schou, who is the owner of hacking resource  Secret Club, initially saw no easy way to restore Wi-Fi capabilities. Eventually, he found that users could reset network functionality by opening Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings.\n Apple representatives didn\u2019t respond to emailed questions, including if there were plans to fix the bug and whether it affected macOS or other Apple offerings.\n Schou said in an Internet message that the bug is caused by the internal logging functionality in the iOS Wi-Fi daemon, which uses the SSID inside of format expressions. The condition makes it possible in some cases for unauthorized format strings to be injected into sensitive parts of the highly fortified Apple OS. He and other security experts, however, said there was little chance of the bug being exploited maliciously.\n    \u201cIn my opinion, the real-world threat is minimal as you are quite constrained by the length of the SSID and the format expression itself,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou could potentially turn this into an information disclosure in the logger, but I do not think it is even remotely possible to get code execution.\u201d\n A  quick analysis of the bug by an outside researcher agreed that it isn\u2019t likely the bug could be exploited to execute malicious code. The analysis also found that the bug appears to stem from a flaw in an iOS logging component that uses the  concat function to effectively convert the SSID string into a format string before writing it to the log file.\n Because the strings aren\u2019t echoed to sensitive parts of the iOS, a hacker is unlikely to succeed in abusing the logging feature maliciously. Besides that, an exploit would require a person to actively join a network that contains a suspicious-looking name.\n \u201cFor the exploitability, it doesn\u2019t echo and the rest of the parameters don\u2019t seem to be controllable,\u201d the researcher wrote. \u201cThus I don\u2019t think this case is exploitable. After all, to trigger this bug, you need to connect to that WiFi, where the SSID is visible to the victim. A phishing Wi-Fi portal page might as well be more effective.\u201d\n  Not all researchers reached the same assessment. Researchers from security firm AirEye, for instance,  said that the technique could be used to bypass security appliances that sit at the perimeter of a network to block unauthorized data from entering or exiting.\n \u201cWhat we found was that although the latest iPhone Format String flaw is perceived as seemingly benign, the implications of this vulnerability stretch far and beyond any joking matter,\u201d AirEye researcher Amichai Shulman wrote. \u201cIf you are responsible for the security of your organization, you should be aware of this vulnerability as a related attack can affect corporate data while bypassing common security controls such as NAC, firewalls and DLP solutions.\u201d\n    Shulman also said that macOS is affected by the same bug. Ars couldn\u2019t immediately verify this claim. Schou said he hasn\u2019t tested macOS but that others have reported they were unable to reproduce the error on the OS.\n  Schou told me that the network crashes don\u2019t happen every time an iOS device connects to a malicious SSID. \u201cIt&#39;s nondeterministic, and sometimes you are lucky enough that the Wi-Fi daemon crashes without it persisting [in] the SSID,\u201d he explained. The flaw has existed since at least iOS 14.4.2, which was released in March, and possibly for years before that.\n He said he discovered the bug when he connected an iPhone to one of his wireless routers. \u201cAll of my devices are named after various injection techniques to mess with old devices that do not sanitize input,\u201d Schou said. \u201cAnd apparently, the latest iOS.\u201d\n The crash is caused by what researchers call a  uncontrolled format string bug. The flaw arises when corrupted user input is the format string parameter in certain functions written in C and C-style languages. Use of format tokens such as %s and %x can in some cases print data to memory. The bug was initially considered harmless. More recently, researchers have recognized the potential for writing malicious code using the %n format token.\n The most surprising thing about this bug is the fact that it exists at all. A wide assortment of programming guidelines exists for preventing these types of format string flaws.

This \u201cfundamental knowledge\u201d unlocks a huge number of paths to new experiments and findings.\n  The   gut brain greatly affects on how you body works. Your digestive system has a daily job to do as part of your metabolism, but it\u2019s also subject to fluctuations in functionality, and otherwise related to your emotions.\n Digestive symptoms and anxiety can be comorbid, and your gut is heavily affected by stress. So scientists believe having a better understanding of what happens in your ENS could lead to better medicines and treatments for a variety of conditions, as well as improved knowledge of the connection between the ENS and central nervous system.\n This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n  The   new research appears in  Nature Neuroscience. In a related commentary, scientist Julia Ganz explains what the researchers found and   why it\u2019s so important:\n \u201cUsing single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile the developing and juvenile ENS, the authors discovered a conceptually new model of neuronal diversification in the ENS and establish a new molecular taxonomy of enteric neurons based on a plethora of molecular markers.\u201d\n  Neuronal diversification happens in, well, all the organisms that  have neurons. Similar to stem cells, neurons develop first as more generic \u201cblanks\u201d and then into functional specialties. The human brain has types like sensory and motor neurons, each of which has subtypes. There are so many subtypes, in fact, that scientists   aren\u2019t sure how to even fully catalog them yet.\n Neurons of the same superficial type are different in the brain versus the brain  stem\u2014let alone in the digestive tract. So researchers had to start at the very beginning and trace how these neurons develop. They tracked RNA, which determines how DNA is expressed in the cells made by your body, to follow how neurons formed both before and after birth. Some specialties emerge in utero, and some split and form afterward.\n  To find this new information, the scientists developed a finer way to separate and identify cells. Ganz explains:\n \u201cUsing extensive co-staining with established markers, they were able to relate the twelve neuron classes to previously discovered molecular characteristics of functional enteric neuron types, thus classifying the ENCs into excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons, interneurons, and intrinsic primary afferent neurons.\u201d\n With a sharper protocol and new information, the researchers were able to confirm and expand on the existing body of ENS neuron knowledge. And now they can work on finding out what each of the 12 ENS neuron types is responsible for, they say.\n By isolating different kinds and \u201cswitching\u201d them on or off using genetic information, scientists can try to identify what\u2019s missing from the function of the mouse ENS. And studying these genes could lead to new treatments that use stem cells or RNA to control the expression of harmful genes.\n   This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

Free community support is available through the Rocky Linux  Mattermost,  IRC, and  forums. Paid commercial support is currently available through CIQ.\n        Corporations come and go, their interests as transient as they are self-serving. But a community persists, and that\u2019s who we dedicate Rocky Linux to: you.\n Rocky is more than the next free and open, community enterprise operating system. It\u2019s a community. A commitment to an ideal bigger than the sum of its parts, and a promise that our  principles\u2014embedded even within our repositories and ISOs\u2014are immutable.\n We\u2019d like to extend a special thanks to our sponsors and our partners, whose contribution of resources, financial backing, software, and infrastructure were all critical in supporting our efforts:\n  Each one brings something special to the community, and we\u2019re grateful for their support.\n  This is just the beginning, and the RESF is more than just Rocky Linux\u2014it\u2019s a home for those that believe that open source isn\u2019t just a switch that can be toggled at will, and that projects that many rely on not be subject to the whims of a few. To this point, you can easily find all of our sources, our build infrastructure, Git repositories, and everything else anyone would need to fork our work and ensure that it continues if need be. Expect more from the RESF in the coming weeks and months.\n When we announced our release candidate, we asked you to come build the next free, open, community enterprise operating system with us.

The same is true even when people using these chemicals urinate them into the sewage system. Once there, these compounds\u2014from  prozac to  cocaine\u2014can end up in the bodies of aquatic creatures. And, research suggests, the chemicals can impact them:  birth control, for instance, affects frog breeding after it enters the water.\n We metabolize many of the drugs we take, and water treatment plants remove some of rest. But some concentration can still remain as the water is released to the surrounding lakes and streams.\n So far, there&#39;s not been much research into how, if at all, other drugs like cocaine and  various opioids, affect aquatic life\u2014but scientists say negative effects are not wholly impossible. And there is now some evidence that at least some classification of drugs do cause trouble.  New research suggests that a common antidepressant, citalopram, can change the behavior of crayfish, making them bolder than they would be otherwise.\n The data come from A.J. Reisinger\u2014assistant professor in the Soil and Water Sciences Department at the University of Florida\u2014and his team, which travelled to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 2017. The facility has several artificial streams that mimic natural conditions but allow researchers to control different aspects of the environment. Reisinger&#39;s team went out into the field and collected rocks, bugs, leaves, and crayfish and put them into the artificial streams.\n Crayfish were chosen because they can reach high biomasses in aquatic ecosystems and will &#34;eat anything they can get their claws on. They&#39;ll eat bugs, they&#39;ll eat algae, they&#39;ll eat leaves, they&#39;ll eat juvenile fish, even,&#34; Reisinger told Ars.\n     The researchers brought their subjects to the Cary Institute and began their experiment after setting up each stream as close to reality as possible using the rocks and other material from the crayfish&#39;s normal environment. They set up a quarter of the streams to have neither citalopram\u2014a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant\u2014nor crayfish as a control. In a second quarter of the streams, they added crayfish but no citalopram. In a third quarter, they had only the SSRI\u2014in concentrations that have been found in nature\u2014and in the fourth, they added both.\n From there, the researchers let the experiment run for two weeks before removing individual crayfish and putting them in new tanks. These tanks had mazes in the middle, and Reisinger&#39;s team initially introduced the crayfish to them via a small shelter at one end. At the opposite side of the maze, the team placed either a substance that smelled like food (sardine gelatin, in this case) or another crayfish. The researchers wanted see how their subjects would react.\n The crayfish that were exposed to citalopram left their shelters faster, and they spent more time moving toward the food, compared to their peers who didn&#39;t get the SSRI. They didn&#39;t show any more interest in moving toward the other crayfish, however.\n &#34;That tells us they&#39;re more bold. They&#39;re more likely to leave their shelter in their real environment,&#34; Reisinger said.\n That boldness could potentially have a broader impact on the environment. The team found that the streams containing crayfish saw an increase an algal biomass and organic matter. However, this wasn&#39;t dependent on the crustaceans being exposed to the antidepressant.\n According to Reisinger, the bolder crayfish that had been exposed to citalopram might have had a different effect on the streams if the researchers had run the experiments for longer than two weeks. There were likely lags between the addition of the drug and the crayfish&#39;s altered behavior as well as between that and the crayfish having a different impact on their environment. &#34;We think that, if we had run the study for a little bit longer, we might have seen a difference,&#34; he said.\n     Alex Ford, a professor of biology at Portsmouth University in the UK, ran one of the earliest studies on the effects on prozac, another antidepressant, on shrimp. Much like Reisinger&#39;s work, Ford&#39;s suggested that the drug made them more reckless and active. Since then, his team has looked into a  slew of other substances in aquatic organisms, including other SSRIs and benzodiazepines.\n Ars asked Ford if it&#39;s possible for shrimp and other aquatic species to become intoxicated (or otherwise have their behaviors changed) as a result of recreational or medicinal psychoactive substances reaching the waterways. He said, &#34;Theoretically, yes. Not just with cocaine, but with the whole suite of drugs out there\u2014the illegal ones.&#34;\n Ford noted that, in the past, he and various colleagues studied if low amounts of cocaine would affect shrimp behavior, but it did not appear to. However, they simply looked at swimming speed among shrimp, and it&#39;s possible that other behaviors would&#39;ve changed. The concentration of the drugs\u2014which usually appears in water in low but continuous levels\u2014is also a factor.\n Hypothetically, say there&#39;s a small village that used a lot of fentanyl, an incredibly potent opioid. This hypothetical village also doesn&#39;t have the best water treatment plant, and the river into which wastewater flows is tiny. Under these conditions there could, theoretically, be an effect.\n Last month, Ford and around 30 international authors penned  a report suggesting that regulating bodies should consider potential changes to behavior in aquatic organisms before greenlighting a new chemical. Currently, they are tested for their effects on growth and reproduction. &#34;When we assess the impact of chemicals on the environment, we need to consider behavior, because at the moment, most chemicals only go through quite simple tests before they go on the market,&#34;

Rocky Linux 8.4 is binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, making it possible to run apps designed and tested only for RHEL without RHEL itself.   One of the questions we&#39;ve gotten repeatedly since first covering CentOS Linux&#39;s deprecation is &#34;why not just use [my favorite distro]?&#34; Linux and BSD users tend to be so accustomed to the same software working on multiple distributions, with similar package names and installation procedures, that they forget what using and installing proprietary software is frequently like. Rocky Linux and competitor  AlmaLinux (which released its own binary-compatible RHEL 8.4 clone in March) aren&#39;t simply &#34;Linux distros&#34; or even &#34;Linux distros which closely resemble RHEL.&#34; They&#39;re built from the same source code as RHEL 8.4, which guarantees that a wide array of proprietary software designed with nothing but RHEL 8.4 in mind will &#34;just work,&#34; regardless of how obscure a feature (or bug!) those packages depend upon in RHEL 8.4 might be.\n Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux aren&#39;t the only RHEL-compatible options out there, of course. Last December, we published a partial  list\u00a0of binary-compatible alternatives to RHEL, including RHEL&#39;s own CentOS Stream (which is only available as a rolling release) and Oracle Linux, as well as Rocky, Alma, and Alma&#39;s parent distro, CloudLinux.\n What makes Rocky Linux\u2014and AlmaLinux\u2014special is that both distros were created specifically to fill the void left by CentOS&#39;s deprecation. Their specific goal is to be available for anyone who needs them with commercial support also available. That latter point is in contrast with, for example, Springdale Linux\u2014which is another long-running &#34;RHEL rebuild&#34; which should &#34;just work.&#34; But it was primarily intended for and supported by a relatively small academic community.\n  Like any other Linux distro, you can simply  download an ISO of Rocky Linux and install it from scratch. But since Rocky Linux is specifically intended to serve as an easy replacement for similar distributions, it comes with easy-to-use conversion scripts as well.\n    There is no supported migration path from one of Rocky Linux&#39;s earlier release candidate (RC) builds to today&#39;s production build\u2014but interested users of other RHEL 8.4 binary-compatible distributions can use the free  migrate2rocky tool for convenient, in-place migration to Green Obsidian that should not mess up existing users, installed software, etc. The following distributions are supported by  migrate2rocky:\n  The Rocky Linux team warns that while migrations from other point releases &#34;may work,&#34; the only supported migration sources are those specifically built from RHEL 8.4 source. There are also issues with  Katello and some error messages associated with migrations beginning with RHEL 8.4 itself. We strongly recommend interested users carefully read the full  migrate2rocky release notes prior to attempting a migration\u2014and, as always, have tested and working backups available before proceeding!\n  Although Rocky Linux 8.4 is offered as a production-ready distribution today, one notable feature isn&#39;t available yet\u2014support for Secure Boot, which the Rocky team describes as a &#34;non-trivial process&#34; to get going on a new distribution.\n The process of enabling Secure Boot with Rocky is underway, however, and the team expects a second set of ISOs with Secure Boot support to be built and released relatively soon. Until then, potential Rocky Linux users who can&#39;t wait for Secure Boot support should consider AlmaLinux 8.4, which received its own Secure Boot support this May.\n Although there is always some element of risk when doing in-place migrations, it&#39;s worth noting that installing AlmaLinux (or another 8.4 compatible distro) with Secure Boot today does not mean you can&#39;t shift over to Rocky Linux later\u2014the  migrate2rocky\u00a0tool referenced in the last section should typically work simply, relatively quickly, and reliably if you need Secure Boot today but still prefer Rocky Linux once its Secure Boot support becomes available.\n  In the words of the Rocky Linux team, &#34;this is just the beginning, and the [Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation] is more than just Rocky Linux.&#34; The team goes on to describe the RESF as &#34;a home for those that believe that open source isn&#39;t just a switch that can be toggled at will.&#34;\n In order to put its money where its mouth is, the RESF didn&#39;t stop with making Green Obsidian&#39;s source code available\u2014the build infrastructure, Git repos, and &#34;everything else anyone would need to fork our work&#34; is easy to find.\n Although the RESF hasn&#39;t specified any other projects by name, it says that users should expect more in the coming weeks and months\u2014strongly implying that it may assist in hosting software and projects from like-minded developers and communities in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:17:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Amazon&#39;s warehouse in Dunfermline, Scotland. The footage showed laptops, TVs, jewelry, headphones, books, and face masks being loaded into crates marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n  An anonymous former Amazon employee told ITV that workers at the warehouse were given a weekly target of 130,000 items to destroy. This was corroborated by an internal memo viewed by ITV, which showed that during one week in April, 124,000 items were marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n      &#34;There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 COVID (face) masks still in their wrappers,&#34; the ex-employee told ITV. About half of the items marked for destruction were still in their shrink-wrap, while the other half were returned items in good condition, they said.\n An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that Dunfermline handles all products marked for destruction for the entire UK.\n  If 130,000 is a weekly average, that would translate to more than 6 million products marked for destruction every year. In 2019, undercover reporters in France found that Amazon destroyed  over 3 million products in one year.\n     ITV filmed the boxes of products marked &#34;destroy&#34; being loaded into trucks and driven to recycling centers, as well as to a landfill site.\n In a statement to Insider, the Amazon spokesperson said the landfill site mentioned by ITV was also a recycling center.\n &#34;We are working toward a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations, or recycle any unsold products. No items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero,&#34; the spokesperson said.\n In 2019, the  Mail on Sunday sent undercover reporters into a different UK warehouse where they witnessed unsold products being placed in a so-called &#34;destruction zone.&#34; The Mail then tracked the products from that warehouse as they were loaded into trucks and taken to a waste-disposal site and a landfill.\n     Amazon&#39;s spokesperson did not comment on whether the company had changed its infrastructure since the Mail&#39;s 2019 investigation.\n  By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.\n          Two crossed lines that form an &#39;X&#39;.

", "note_en": "Both creators were  suspended following ASMR streams that pushed the bounds of Twitch\u2019s community guidelines forbidding content that isn\u2019t  quite sexual in nature but is still too risqu\u00e9 for a platform deeply self-conscious about its advertising business. The Amazon-owned company declined to comment on the length of the bans or what provoked them, but pointed TechCrunch toward its rules on sexual content.\n It\u2019s possible that both Amouranth (Kaitlyn Siragusa) and Indiefoxx (Jenelle Dagres) will be reinstated Monday, 72 hours after their Friday ban, but both channels remained unavailable at the time of writing. Siragusa  confirmed to Polygon that she was suspended after a stream in which she did yoga poses while making ear-licking sounds into a microphone.\n   The so-called \u201c ASMR-meta\u201d on Twitch, where streamers boost their views by whispering into their microphones or producing licking sounds, sometimes while holding yoga poses, follows the  controversy around hot tubs on Twitch that exploded last month. In both instances, some Twitch creators believe that the platform\u2019s rules are selectively enforced.\n \u201cWith ASMR meta and crazy yoga poses, believe it or not I watched two other girls doing it to the tune of 2-5k views without any bans for months before I folded the activity into ASMR creating the infamous \u2018ASMR\u2019 meta,\u201d Siragusa wrote on Twitter. \u201cThose other streamers are still unbanned and continue to do it. My sin was taking inaction as a sign of tacit acceptance, and then blowing the top off the secret and hitting 30k viewers.\u201d\n Because both the ASMR meta and the hot tub meta were dominated by female streamers, the whole situation has attracted even more misogyny within the Twitch community, where  female streamers are still regularly harassed off the platform.\n I will always find it ENORMOUSLY IRONIC that the generation that fought \u201cviolent video games don\u2019t cause an uptick in gun/violent crimes\u201d(I agree), instantly turn tail &amp; succumb to a bad take like \u201cHOT TUB/ASMR GIRLS LITERALLY CREATE CREEPERS that plague other girl creators!\u201d\n  In a blog addressing the proliferation of women streaming from pools and hot tubs at the time, Twitch wrote that \u201cbeing found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness.\u201d The company clarified that while a bathing suit in a bedroom might break the rules, \u201ccontextually appropriate\u201d swimwear is allowed.\n  \u201cOur intention with the Sexually Suggestive policy was to draw a line on content that is overtly or explicitly sexually suggestive, not to ban all content that could be viewed as sexually suggestive \u2013 but we acknowledge that our rules are not as clear as they could be.\n Prohibiting every form of content that could be interpreted as suggestive would also result in far more restrictions on the video games and premium content that we currently allow, especially considering the ways that female characters are sometimes objectified or presented in a sexualized manner.\u201d\n Its solution at the time was to create a \u201cPools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches\u201d category where that content could live. Most of Twitch\u2019s categories are dedicated to specific games, with most of the platform\u2019s non-gaming streams listed in the popular catch-all category \u201cJust Chatting.\u201d\n ASMR has its own category with 2.4 million followers, encompassing ear-tingling ASMR streams that don\u2019t push the boundaries of Twitch\u2019s rules with the more recent crop of those that do. So far, instead of building out a more thoughtful way to corral sexually suggestive content, the company is opting to punish anybody who it decides crosses the line. But it\u2019s possible that could all change: Last month, Twitch said it was working on new policies to further clarify the rules on sexually suggestive content.\n Unfortunately for Twitch \u2014 and for the female creators disproportionately affected by its uneven policies \u2014 the abundance of ear-licking streams suggests that until then, the company will be making these same determinations over and over as it tries to draw a line within a gray area of its own making.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:16:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "asmr,suspends,\u62bd\u6410", "title": "\u62bd\u6410\u6682\u505c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684ASMR\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5973\u6027\u521b\u4f5c\u8005 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTwitch suspends two popular female creators over sexy ASMR streams\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/twitch-asmr-meta-amouranth-indiefoxx/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["asmr", "suspends", "\u62bd\u6410"]}]
