Late on the evening of 29 January 2017,  Daniel David and Victor Opariuc parked up and made their way towards the Frontier Forwarding customs warehouse in Feltham, less than a mile from Heathrow. After cutting a hole in the fence, the men made their way to the side of the building and scaled a wall to the roof. There, they cut through a skylight and lowered themselves on to shelving inside the building. The warehouse burglar alarms stayed silent; the men had carefully avoided tripping motion sensors positioned by the doors.</p><p>    E一切都按计划进行了。 2017年1月29日深夜，丹尼尔·大卫（Daniel David）和维克多·奥帕里乌克（Victor Opariuc）停下车，驶向距离希思罗机场不到一英里的费尔顿（Feltham）边境运输海关仓库。在栅栏上打了一个洞之后，这些人走到了建筑物的侧面，并在屋顶上缩放了一堵墙。在那儿，他们穿过天窗，然后降落到建筑物内的架子上。仓库的防盗警报器保持沉默。这些人小心翼翼地避免了门旁边的运动传感器跳闸。</p><p> Once inside, with several lookouts posted around the surrounding industrial estate, the men took their time. Over the next five hours and 15 minutes, they broke padlocks off packing cases and placed items inside 16 large holdalls taken from inside the warehouse. The men escaped the same way they had entered: out through the skylight and back into the night.</p><p> 进了屋子之后，周围的工业区张贴了一些监视信号，这些人花了很多时间。在接下来的5小时15分钟内，他们将挂锁从包装箱中解开，并将物品放在从仓库内部取出的16个大行李箱中。这些人以与他们进入时相同的方式逃脱：从天窗出来然后回到黑夜。</p><p>  About 12 hours later, Alessandro Meda Riquier received a phone call from his shipping company. Riquier was at home in Italy when he learned that 52 valuable books that were meant to be on their way to a major trade fair in the US had been stolen. Riquier was one of three book dealers affected by the theft. In total, around 240 books and manuscripts were taken, including works by Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci and the 18th-century Spanish painter Francisco de Goya. The total value was estimated at more than £2.5m.</p><p>  大约12小时后，亚历山德罗·梅达·里基尔（Alessandro Meda Riquier）接到了他的运输公司的电话。里基耶（Riquier）当时在意大利家里，当时他得知有52本本打算前往美国举行的大型贸易展览会的珍贵书籍被盗。里基尔是受盗窃影响的三本书商之一。总共拍摄了约240本书和手稿，包括艾萨克·牛顿爵士，伽利略，莱昂纳多·达·芬奇和18世纪西班牙画家弗朗西斯科·德·戈雅的作品。总价值估计超过250万英镑。</p><p> Riquier immediately called the  Antiquarian Booksellers Association, a trade body for rare book dealers in the UK, providing details of the stolen items for circulation. Going through the list of missing books, he thought about the time the collection had taken him to assemble. Thirteen years before, he had given up a law career to pursue his passion for book collecting. “At one point of my professional life I said, ‘I don’t want to be a lawyer any more,’” he tells me. “I want something that gives me more satisfaction.” Riquier would spend months researching books before negotiating to acquire them. “I started from zero,” he says.</p><p> 里基尔立即致电英国古董书商协会（Antiquarian Booksellers Association），该书提供了被盗物品的详细流通信息。在浏览丢失的书籍清单时，他想了想收藏的时间。十三年前，他放弃了从事律师的职业，以追求对书籍收藏的热情。他告诉我：“在我的职业生涯中，我曾说过''我不再想当律师'。' “我想要让我更加满意的东西。”里基尔（Riquier）将花费数月的时间研究书籍，然后再进行谈判以获取书籍。他说：“我从零开始。”</p><p> Works by Sir Isaac Newton, Galileo, Leonardo da Vinci and Francisco de Goya were taken, valued at more than £2.5m</p><p> 艾萨克·牛顿爵士，伽利略，莱昂纳多·达·芬奇和弗朗西斯科·德·戈雅的作品成交价超过250万英镑</p><p> Now, more than half his stock had disappeared. The collection was insured, but that was only of limited consolation. “It’s not a question of money,” he says. The stolen items were not things you could “buy just around the corner”.</p><p> 现在，他一半以上的股票都消失了。该收藏品已获得保险，但这仅仅是有限的安慰。他说：“这不是金钱问题。”被盗的物​​品不是您可以“马上购买”的东西。 </p><p> Historically, book thieves have come in two varieties. First, there are the rogue custodians, those who exploit their privileged access to literary treasures. In June this year, Gregory Priore, an archivist at the Carnegie Library in Pittsburgh, was convicted of stealing more than 300 rare books and other artefacts estimated to be worth around £6m over a 20-year period. Then there are the academics – or, at least, those who profess an academic interest in the texts they go on to steal. In 2009, Iranian author  Farhad Hakimzadeh was convicted of stealing pages from as many as 150 rare books at the Bodleian and British libraries, smuggling a scalpel into reading rooms to remove maps and illustrations for his personal collection. The following year,  William Jacques, a Cambridge University graduate dubbed the “ Tome Raider”, was jailed for a series of thefts from the Royal Horticultural Society library. Jacques was believed to have carried out his crimes over several months, signing into the library under a fake name before walking out with rare books hidden beneath his jacket.</p><p>从历史上看，窃贼有两种。首先，有一些流氓保管人，他们利用特权来获取文学宝藏。今年6月，匹兹堡卡内基图书馆的档案保管员格里高里·普里奥（Gregory Priore）被判盗窃了300多本稀有书籍和其他手工艺品，估计在20年内价值约600万英镑。然后是学者，或者至少是那些对自己继续窃取的文字表现出学术兴趣的学者。 2009年，伊朗作家法哈德·哈基姆扎德（Farhad Hakimzadeh）被判犯有从Bodleian和英国图书馆盗窃多达150本稀有书籍中的页面，将解剖刀偷运到阅览室中以删除其个人收藏的地图和插图的罪名。次年，剑桥大学的毕业生威廉·雅克（William Jacques）被称为“圣多美攻略”，因皇家园艺协会图书馆的一系列盗窃罪而入狱。人们相信雅克已经犯了好几个月的罪行，以假名签入图书馆，然后走出外套藏在书本下的稀有书籍。</p><p> What these cases illustrate is that book theft is a slow and surreptitious crime. Thefts typically take place over many years. Sometimes, the books are taken for the thief’s personal pleasure. Alternatively, identifying marks are removed and the books are sold before anyone has noticed they are missing. But the Feltham heist was different. Several experts told me they could not recall a similar crime, in which hundreds of books had been brazenly stolen in a highly targeted raid. David Ward, a borough officer with Hounslow police, who was assigned to investigate the burglary, knew immediately that the break-in was the work of professionals. “They did it with a degree of finesse,” he says. “A less-sophisticated way would be just to jam a door open. But that obviously would trigger alarms. Going in via the ceiling, while quite dangerous, was the safest way for them not to be detected.”</p><p> 这些案件说明，偷书是一种缓慢而秘密的犯罪。盗窃通常发生多年。有时，这些书是为小偷的个人娱乐而准备的。或者，在任何人注意到书名丢失之前，先删除识别标记并出售书。但是Feltham的抢劫是不同的。几位专家告诉我，他们不记得类似的罪行，在一次针对性很强的突袭中，数百本书被偷偷地偷走了。霍恩斯洛警察局的区长戴维·沃德（David Ward）被指派调查盗窃案，他立即知道闯入是专业人士的工作。他说：“他们做到了一定的技巧。” “不那么复杂的方法就是将门打开。但这显然会触发警报。穿过天花板，虽然很危险，但是是不被发现的最安全的方法。”</p><p> During the investigation, Ward and his colleagues trawled through 50 hours of CCTV footage, eventually identifying two cars used in the burglary, and vehicle insurance records provided the investigation’s first lead. “It became apparent that the people we were identifying were Romanian nationals,” says Ward. “But they weren’t known to our criminal systems.” Around two weeks after the burglary, Ward received a phone call from a senior officer with the Romanian national police. Ward listened as the man recounted intelligence that connected the raid to an organised crime gang that operated out of Romania. Following the call, the two forces opened a joint investigation.</p><p> 在调查过程中，沃德和他的同事翻阅了50个小时的闭路电视录像，最终确定了两起在盗窃中使用的汽车，车辆保险记录提供了调查的第一线索。沃德说：“很明显，我们所识别的人是罗马尼亚国民。” “但是我们的犯罪系统并不了解它们。”入室盗窃发生大约两周后，沃德接到了一名高级官员与罗马尼亚国家警察的电话。当这名男子讲述了将袭击与罗马尼亚以外的一个有组织犯罪团伙联系起来的情报时，沃德听了。接到电话后，两军展开了联合调查。</p><p> Over the subsequent months, officers linked the Feltham raid to a series of other burglaries at commercial warehouses across the UK. Elsewhere, the thieves had stolen high-value electronics rather than books. But the break-ins all carried the hallmarks of a professional team. As the scale of the gang’s activities began to emerge, the case was elevated to the Metropolitan police’s specialist crime squad, led by detective inspector Andy Durham, and Ward joined the team to assist with the investigation. Their first goal was to try to prevent further offences. “There was an ongoing risk to London and to the UK from this organised group,” says Durham. “But the other main objective was recovering these books.” That meant grappling with an unprecedented question: what might an organised crime gang want with a trove of rare books?</p><p> 在随后的几个月中，官员将Feltham袭击与英国各地商业仓库的一系列其他入室盗窃案联系在一起。在其他地方，小偷窃取的是高价值电子产品，而不是书籍。但是闯入都带有一支专业团队的标志。随着该团伙活动规模的扩大，案件由侦探督察安迪·达勒姆（Andy Durham）带领，移交给了大都会警察的专职犯罪小队，沃德（Ward）也加入了该团队以协助调查。他们的首要目标是试图防止进一步的犯罪。达勒姆说：“这个有组织的组织正在对伦敦和英国构成持续的风险。” “但是另一个主要目标是回收这些书。”这意味着要应对一个前所未有的问题：一个有组织的犯罪团伙想要一堆稀有书籍，是什么？</p><p>  Like many an old-school copper, Dick Ellis can appreciate a well-executed crime. “This was one of them, no question,” he says. “Hats off to them.” Ellis, the former head of Scotland Yard’s art and antiquities squad, has investigated plenty of high-profile cultural thefts during his 30-year career. In 1994, he recovered  Edvard Munch’s   The Scream, three months after the painting was stolen from a Norwegian museum. That was a rare happy ending. Ellis says the recovery rate for stolen artworks is less than 5%. “It is abysmally low.”</p><p>  像许多老式的铜线一样，迪克·埃利斯（Dick Ellis）可以欣赏到执行良好的犯罪。他说：“毫无疑问，这就是其中之一。” “向他们致敬。”苏格兰场前艺术与文物小队负责人埃利斯（Ellis）在他30年的职业生涯中，调查了许多备受瞩目的文化盗窃案。 1994年，在这幅画从挪威博物馆被盗三个月后，他收回了爱德华·蒙克的《呐喊》。那是一个难得的幸福结局。埃利斯说，被盗艺术品的回收率不到5％。 “这真是太低了。”</p><p> According to Ellis, book theft has undergone an evolution over the past 10 to 15 years. “Prior to that, the theft of manuscripts and rare books was unusual, and quite often committed by people who had access,” he says, such as librarians and academics. But every new high-profile heist raises awareness of the fact that rare books are valuable enough to be worth stealing. At some point, “People realised that these were a comparatively soft target,” Ellis says. And it was only a matter of time before organised criminals spotted an opportunity.</p><p> 根据埃利斯（Ellis）的说法，在过去10到15年中，图书盗窃经历了一次演变。他说：“在此之前，手稿和稀有书籍的盗窃是不寻常的，而且经常是有访问权限的人所为，”他说，例如图书馆员和学者。但是，每一次新的引人注目的抢劫案都使人们意识到，稀有书籍的价值足以值得窃取。在某些时候，“人们意识到这是一个相对较软的目标，”埃利斯说。有组织的犯罪分子发现机会只是时间问题。</p><p> Hetty Gleave, a partner at Hunters Law and a specialist in art and cultural property law, says the risks posed to rare books took longer to recognise than it did elsewhere in the cultural sector. “Books haven’t really featured on the radar in the same way that looted property or stolen art have,” she says, “partly because it takes people a long time to notice they’ve gone.”</p><p> 亨特·法（Hunters Law）合伙人，艺术和文化财产法专家赫蒂·格里夫（Hetty Gleave）表示，与文化部门其他地方相比，发现稀有书籍所面临的风险要花费更长的时间。她说：“书本上没有像抢劫财产或被盗艺术品那样真正引起人们的关注，部分原因是人们花了很长时间才注意到书已经走了。” </p><p> In the past, the rarity of book thefts may also have contributed to a laissez-faire attitude when texts changed hands. Adrian Edwards, head of printed heritage collections at the British Library, says provenance checks by purchasers were carried out much less stringently in decades gone by. “I just don’t think they thought to ask the questions then,” he says. But in recent years the book trade has become more attuned to the need for robust checks around an item’s history. Today, Edwards says, “It’s more at the forefront of people’s minds.”</p><p>过去，当文本易手时，书籍盗窃的稀有性也可能导致自由放任的态度。大英图书馆印刷遗产收藏负责人阿德里安·爱德华兹（Adrian Edwards）表示，过去几十年中，购买者对原产地的检查并不那么严格。他说：“我只是不认为他们当时想问问题。”但是近年来，图书交易已经变得更加顺应需求，需要对商品的历史进行严格的检查。如今，爱德华兹说：“如今，它已成为人们关注的最前沿。”</p><p> With increased awareness of provenance issues and the high-profile nature of the Feltham heist, how did the gang expect to sell the looted items? “It’s a good question, because what was stolen was so rare that you couldn’t have gone to a book fair anywhere in the world and been able to sell them,” says Ellis. Art sold on the black market tends only to fetch up to 10% of its open-market value, he adds. And while stolen artwork has been used as collateral in deals between crime gangs, “I don’t think that the criminal underworld would go into dealing in books as collateral in the same way as they do with fine art.”</p><p> 随着人们对出处问题的认识不断增强，以及Feltham抢劫案的高调性质，该团伙如何期望出售被掠夺的物品？埃利斯说：“这是一个很好的问题，因为被盗的东西非常罕见，以至于您不可能去世界任何地方参加书展并能够出售它们。”他补充说，在黑市上出售的艺术品往往只能拿到其公开市场价值的10％。而且，虽然盗窃的艺术品已被用作犯罪团伙之间的交易的抵押品，但“我不认为犯罪的黑社会会以与艺术品一样的方式来处理书籍作为抵押品。”</p><p> The fact that the books stolen in Feltham would be easily identifiable was a reason to remain hopeful about their recovery. Privately, however, officers at the Metropolitan police feared a different outcome. As the investigation progressed, evidence emerged suggesting links between the gang and a notorious Romanian crime family. Intelligence provided by the Romanian police suggested the family had previously stolen valuable paintings and those paintings were believed to have been burned when the gang felt law enforcement tightening the net around them. “So, yeah,” says Durham, “we certainly had to tread lightly.”</p><p> 在费尔顿（Feltham）被盗的书籍很容易被识别的事实，使人们对其恢复抱有希望。然而，私下里，大都会警察担心结果会有所不同。随着调查的进行，越来越多的证据表明该团伙与一个臭名昭著的罗马尼亚犯罪家庭之间存在联系。罗马尼亚警方提供的情报显示，这家人以前曾盗走过有价值的画作，并且当该团伙感到执法部门收紧他们周围的网眼时，这些画作被焚毁。 “是的，是的，”达勒姆说，“我们当然必须轻踩。”</p><p> In the early   hours of 25 June 2019, Durham and Ward joined police colleagues from Romania and Italy at a Europol command centre in Rotterdam. More than 300 officers had been assigned to search 45 addresses in the three countries. In Rotterdam, there was an air of trepidation in the room as the officers waited nervously to see how the raids would play out. “It was very exciting,” says Durham, “and a long time coming.”</p><p> 在2019年6月25日凌晨，达勒姆和沃德与来自罗马尼亚和意大利的警察同事一起在鹿特丹的欧洲刑警组织指挥中心。已指派300多名官员在这三个国家搜索45个地址。在鹿特丹，当警官紧张地等待观察突袭如何进行时，房间里充满了恐惧的气氛。达勒姆（Durham）说：“这非常令人兴奋，而且还有很长一段时间。”</p><p> At 4am London time, police broke down doors across the continent and Durham and Ward started to tick off names of suspects as news of arrests came in. “We got the vast majority of people that we were hoping to find,” says Durham. By the end of the operation, 15 men were in custody. At one of the properties, officers found a holdall matching the description of those taken from Feltham, but there was no sign of the stolen books.</p><p> 伦敦时间凌晨4点，警察闯入了整个非洲大陆，随着逮捕消息的到来，达勒姆和沃德开始对嫌疑犯的名字进行打勾。“我们找到了我们希望找到的绝大多数人，”达勒姆说。到手术结束时，有十五人被拘留。在其中一处房产中，警官发现了一个与从费尔顿（Feltham）手中取来的描述相符的手提袋，但没有被盗书籍的迹象。</p><p>  Durham says it was always an outside chance that the books would be recovered that day. Instead, the officers got back to work following up new leads. In the weeks after the first arrests, a further three members of the gang were apprehended. In January 2020, Cristian Ungureanu, one of the gang’s most senior members, was detained in Turin. Each time, the suspects were empty-handed.</p><p>  达勒姆（Durham）说，那天总是可以收回这些书。相反，军官们重新开始工作以追踪新线索。在第一次被捕后的几周内，又逮捕了该团伙的三名成员。 2020年1月，该团伙最高级成员之一克里斯蒂安·安古里亚努（Cristian Ungureanu）被拘留在都灵。每次，犯罪嫌疑人都是空手而归。</p><p> Early on in the investigation, Riquier, the Italian book dealer, was hopeful. “In the beginning I said to myself, ‘They are probably going to recover the books,’” he says. As the case dragged on, however, his optimism wavered. Just as the police had fears about the likelihood of the books’ return, Riquier considered other scenarios. He wondered if the books would remain hidden for decades. At times, he imagined the books burnt to a pile of ash. “Even if I had been paid by my insurance company,” he says, “that would be the worst case that I can imagine.”</p><p> 在调查初期，意大利图书经销商里基尔（Riquier）充满希望。他说：“起初，我对自己说：‘他们很可能会找回书本。’然而，随着案件的进行，他的乐观情绪开始动摇。就像警察担心书籍归还的可能性一样，Riquier也考虑了其他情况。他想知道这些书是否会隐藏几十年。有时，他想象书本会燃烧成灰烬。他说：“即使我已经由保险公司付款，这也是我能想到的最糟糕的情况。” </p><p> Thirteen men were eventually charged with offences related to a string of commercial burglaries across the UK, including the Feltham raid. Twelve pleaded guilty. In September this year, two weeks before the gang was due to be sentenced, the Romanian national police searched a house in the northeast of the country. Hidden in a cement pit beneath the floor, they found more than 200 individually wrapped packages. Shortly after the raid, Ward called Riquier. “I have good news for you,” he said.</p><p>最终有13名男子被指控犯有与英国境内一系列商业盗窃案有关的罪行，包括Feltham袭击。十二人认罪。在今年9月，也就是该团伙被判刑之前的两个星期，罗马尼亚国家警察在该国东北部搜寻了一所房屋。他们藏在地板下的水泥坑中，发现了200多个单独包装的包裹。突袭后不久，沃德打电话给里基尔。他说：“我对你有个好消息。”</p><p> Twelve men have so far been sentenced to more than 48 years in prison for their part in the burglaries. During their trial, the court heard how gang members were flown into the UK from Romania, then swiftly flown out again, with stolen property taken out of the country by different individuals. The crime wave was solved in part by analysis of DNA evidence found at the scene of some of the break-ins – a metal bar from Feltham, a drinks can in Southall, a half-finished bottle of milk in Milton Keynes. Most of the time, electronic goods had been stolen. Only one burglary involved the theft of rare books.</p><p> 迄今为止，已有十二人因入室盗窃被判入狱48年以上。在审判过程中，法院得知黑帮成员是如何从罗马尼亚飞抵英国，然后迅速飞回的，被盗财产是由不同个人带出该国的。犯罪浪潮在某种程度上是通过对在一些闯入现场发现的DNA证据的分析得以解决的，这些证据是来自Feltham的金属棒，Southall的饮料罐和Milton Keynes的半瓶牛奶。大多数时候，电子商品被盗。只有一个盗窃案涉及盗窃珍本。</p><p> That may have been the gang’s downfall. The theft of such high-profile cultural property prompted the allocation of resources and a level of international co-operation that would probably never have been committed to investigate missing laptops. “Hopefully, it will make similar organised crime groups think twice about stealing items like that,” says Durham. “They know we won’t give up, we will turn over every stone, we will try every trick, and actually, they don’t want to be looking over their shoulders.”</p><p> 那可能是该团伙的垮台。如此高调的文化财产被盗，促使资源分配和一定程度的国际合作，这可能永远不会致力于调查丢失的笔记本电脑。达勒姆说：“希望这将使类似的有组织犯罪集团在窃取此类物品时三思而后行。” “他们知道我们不会放弃，我们会把所有的石头都翻过来，我们会尝试所有的把戏，实际上，他们不想看着自己的肩膀。”</p><p> Still, there are plenty of unanswered questions about the case. I ask Durham about the timing of the books’ recovery so close to the gang’s sentencing. Was this a coincidence? Durham laughs. “No, it’s not coincidence,” he says. But he declines to give more details, only stating that the raids were based on intelligence. A press statement issued by  Eurojust, the EU agency for cross-border police cooperation, suggested the arrest of Ungureanu in January was a pivotal point in the investigation, describing him as a “kingpin” and stating that “his arrest and collaboration were decisive for the success of this important joint operation”. Asked to confirm if this was the case, the Met police said in a statement: “We would never confirm, nor deny, if any defendant has assisted police with the investigation.”</p><p> 尽管如此，有关此案仍有许多未解决的问题。我问达勒姆（Durham）关于书籍恢复的时间如此接近该团伙的判决。这是巧合吗？达勒姆笑了。他说：“不，这不是巧合。”但是他拒绝透露更多细节，只说这次袭击是基于情报。欧盟跨界警察合作机构Eurojust发表的新闻声明暗示，在一月份逮捕Ungureanu是调查的关键点，称他为“关键人物”，并指出“他的逮捕与合作对于这一重要联合行动的成功”。当被问及是否是这种情况时，大都会警察在一份声明中说：“我们永远不会确认，也不会否认是否有任何被告协助警察进行调查。”</p><p> It also remains unclear how the gang knew where, and when, to strike. The books were only due to be stored at the warehouse for a weekend. “The natural assumption was to believe it was some sort of inside job,” says Ward. Officers followed that line of enquiry, but turned up nothing. “We did thoroughly look at all of those possibilities,” says Durham. “We were never able to work it out. And we were hoping one of the defendants might be kind enough to tell us after arrest and charge, but so far, that’s not been the case.”</p><p> 还不清楚该团伙如何知道何时何地罢工。这些书只应在仓库存放一个周末。沃德说：“自然的假设是相信这是某种内部工作。”警务人员遵循了这条询问线，但未发现任何问题。 “我们确实仔细研究了所有这些可能性，”达勒姆说。 “我们永远无法解决。我们希望其中一名被告能在逮捕和指控后告诉我们，但到目前为止，情况并非如此。”</p><p> If the gang had a buyer for the books in mind, it appears the transaction never took place. Dick Ellis suggests another possibility: that the gang acted on a tip-off about the location of the books, but never considered how they would be brought to market. “They hadn’t thought, ‘How do we now sell these on?’” he says. “And that would suggest to me these are very professional organised criminals who dipped a toe into an area that they’re not familiar with, and they hadn’t actually worked out what to do with the end product.” Ellis is full of praise for the investigation and the successful recovery of the books. But he also warns this won’t be the last time that antique books attract the attention of organised criminals. “They are collectible. They have a value,” he says, “and, therefore, they will be targeted.”</p><p> 如果该团伙有购买书的买家，那么看来交易从未发生。迪克·埃利斯（Dick Ellis）提出了另一种可能性：该团伙为有关书籍的位置提供了一些提示，但从未考虑过如何将它们推向市场。他说：“他们没有想到，‘我们现在如何出售这些东西？’” “这向我暗示这些是非常专业的有组织犯罪分子，他们将脚趾浸入了他们不熟悉的区域，并且实际上还没有弄清楚如何处理最终产品。”埃利斯（Ellis）对书籍的调查和成功收回赞不绝口。但是他也警告说，这不是古董书籍最后一次吸引有组织犯罪分子的注意。他们是可收藏的。他说，它们具有价值，因此将成为目标。</p><p> On the morning   of 19 October, Alessandro Meda Riquier arrived at the Romanian National Library. Also in attendance were Andy Durham and David Ward, their colleagues in the Romanian police and two other book dealers who had items stolen in the Feltham heist. Over the course of two days, the dealers catalogued the books and assessed their condition. Of around 240 books that were stolen, four were still missing, according to the Met police. One in three had suffered some kind of damage. Riquier felt the outcome could have been much worse.</p><p> 10月19日上午，亚历山德罗·梅达·里基尔（Alessandro Meda Riquier）到达了罗马尼亚国家图书馆。出席活动的还有安迪·达勒姆（Andy Durham）和大卫·沃德（David Ward），他们在罗马尼亚警察的同事以及另外两名在Feltham抢劫中被盗的书商。在两天的时间里，经销商对书籍进行了分类并评估了它们的状况。根据大都会警察局的说法，在大约240本书被盗中，仍有4本书失踪。三分之一的人遭受了某种伤害。里基尔觉得结果可能会更糟。 </p><p> I spoke briefly to him after his return to Italy. He sounded relieved; his books had arrived safely just an hour before. I asked him about the atmosphere at the meeting in Romania. “Everybody was happy,” he recalled. “It was the end of a long story.”</p><p>他回到意大利后，我曾与他简短交谈过。 他听起来松了一口气。 一个小时前，他的书就安全到达了。 我问他在罗马尼亚会议上的气氛。 他回忆说：“每个人都很高兴。” “这是一个漫长故事的结尾。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/13/tome-raiders-solving-the-great-book-heist">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/13/tome-raiders-solving-the-great-book-heist</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/袭击者/">#袭击者</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/raiders/">#raiders</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/书籍/">#书籍</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
