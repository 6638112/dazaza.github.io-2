We had a wonderful time in Abu Tig and in Egypt in general. Youasked us to let you know how our transit of the canal went.</p><p>    再次感谢。我们在阿布蒂格和埃及度过了美好的时光。你要求我们让你知道我们的运河过境如何。</p><p>  Overall, the transit was a lot like we expected and perhaps a bit better. Ofcourse, we had heard some very bad stories and felt prepared to deal with whatwould occur.</p><p>  总的来说，过境就像我们预期的那样，也许有点更好。的当然，我们听到了一些非常糟糕的故事，并觉得准备处理什么会发生。</p><p>  We sailed overnight from Abu Tig and arrived at the Suez Canal Yacht Clubaround 9am. We had been in radio contact with Felix Agency for hours and theydid a good job of juggling quite a few boats that were arriving. We got tied upto the buoys quickly and with plenty of help from the yacht club people.</p><p>  我们从阿布蒂格航行过夜，到了苏伊士运河游艇俱乐部凌晨9点左右。我们一直在与Felix局的无线电接触，几个小时做了很好的工作，杂耍了很多船。我们被捆绑了快速到浮标和游艇俱乐部人的帮助。</p><p>  A number of boats had previously reports excessive charges for canal transit.In Abu Tig, at least 5 boats were carefully measured and we calculated theexpected charges based on the published formula. We all had these numbers forreference. The measurer was on Sea Witch with a couple of hours of arrival.Although Felix Agency had promised to accompany the measurer, they were notpresent on our boat or any of the other boats I spoke with that day.</p><p>  此前，许多船只报告了运河过境的过度费用。在阿布蒂格中，小心地测量至少5个船只，我们计算了基于已发布公式的预期费用。我们都有这些数字参考。测量员在海女巫上有几个小时的抵达。虽然Felix局答应伴随着衡量标准，但他们不是在我们的船上或那天有任何其他船上。</p><p>  The measurer came down below and sat at my saloon table. He asked me tomeasure my engine room - width, height and length. No other measurements of anykind were taken. He asked for the numbers from my coast guard doc certificateand also looked at the measurement form I had prepared. I showed him mycalculations and the expected amount. He said he &#34;would see&#34;.</p><p>  测量器下面下面并坐在我的救球桌旁。他问我测量我的发动机室 - 宽度，高度和长度。没有其他任何测量拍摄了。他要求来自海岸卫队Doc证书的数字并看待我准备的测量表。我向他展示了我的计算和预期金额。他说他＆＃34;会看到＆＃34;</p><p>  The previous week, Heartsong III and Nighthawk had transited the canal. Theirmeasurer (no idea if it was the same gentleman or not) had asked them for awatch, sunglasses and a phone. We had cigarettes, money in an envelope andsunglasses prepared. When he went to leave, we gave him the money ($10 USD - allthe boats had agreed to not give more than that) and a pack of cigarettes. Hepolitely asked if we had anything &#34;to remember the boat by&#34;. We gavehim a hat and a picture of the boat. So far, we were content with the process.</p><p>  前一周，Heartong III和Nighthawk过渡了运河。他们的测量者（不知道它是否是同一个绅士或不是）询问了他们手表，太阳镜和手机。我们在信封中有香烟，钱太阳镜准备了。当他离开时，我们给了他钱（10美元 - 全部船只同意不提供超过那个）和一包香烟。他礼貌地问我们是否有任何东西＆＃34;记住船只＆＃34;我们给他是帽子和船的照片。到目前为止，我们满足于这个过程。 </p><p>  Well, nothing happened the rest of the day. No results, bills, etc. We metAchmed from Felix Agency and had a coffee with him. He seemed like a very niceyoung man. He even showed us a nice local place to each and facilitated thegroups transportation, etc.</p><p>好吧，剩下的时间里没有什么发生的。没有结果，账单等我们遇到过从菲利克斯局疼痛，并与他喝咖啡。他看起来很好年轻人。他甚至向每个人向我们展示了一个很好的地方，并促进了团体运输等</p><p>  The next morning, the wind was blowing and the canal was not permitting anyvessels to transit. It took until noon for us to find out what was happening.Prior to that, the person from Felix (not Achmed) kept telling people we wouldtransit that day. OK. No big deal.</p><p>  第二天早上，风吹，管道不允许任何东西船只过境。直到中午给我们找出正在发生的事情。在此之前，来自Felix（没有Achmed）的人一直告诉别人我们会的那天过境。好的。没什么大不了。</p><p>  We had heard from Nighthawk that they had showed up in the morning with thebill and a pilot. Even though the bill was judged excessive by Nighthawk, theypaid it because they were told there was no time to discuss/review it. We wantedto avoid this.</p><p>  我们已经听过九条，他们在早上出现了比尔和飞行员。即使截至九条判断裁判过多支付它，因为他们被告知没有时间讨论/审查它。我们要避免这种情况。</p><p>  We all waited all day with constant promises that the bills would come and wecould pay and get everything out of the way for the transit the next day.Despite constant promises, nothing happened. A number of us went to the movies;Achmed accompanied us. I did wonder who was dealing with the Suez CanalAuthority but assumed they would probably pull what they did with prior boats.</p><p>  我们都在一整天都有不断的承诺，票据会来的第二天可以支付并让所有内容都在过境的方式。尽管承诺不断，但没有任何事情发生。我们许多人去看电影;Achmed伴随着美国。我做了奇迹谁在处理苏伊士运河权威，但假设他们可能会拉动他们用前船只所做的事。</p><p>  Sure enough, the &#34;bills&#34; showed up between 9 and 10am the nextmorning. Actually, Achmed showed up with a &#34;form&#34; that he wrotenumbers on in front of me. The amount for Suez Canal Fees (not agent or portfees) was $225, not the $149 I had carefully calculated. I told Achmed this wastoo high and he said I wouldn&#39;t get to transit if I wanted to argue. I knew Icould be in for at least a day or two of delays, more Yacht Club Fees, etc. so Iagreed to pay it. It was &#34;only&#34; $75 too much. I was never told whatthe calculations were, the gross tons, etc. I was never given a receipt from theSuez Canal Authority, etc. I talked with Outlandish and Poppy (the boats next tome) and they also were 50% higher than expected. By the way, all of us hadprecalculated our tonnage. And, our calculations matched the US calculations onour documentation certificates.</p><p>  果然，＆＃34;账单＆＃34;在下一个和上午10点播出早晨。实际上，Achmed与A＆＃34;形式＆＃34;他写道在我面前的数字。苏伊士运河费用的金额（不是代理人或港口）费用）是225美元，而不是我仔细计算的149美元。我告诉疼痛这是太高了，他说我不会在我想争辩的情况下进入过境。我知道我可能在至少一天或两个延迟，更多的游艇俱乐部费用等。所以我同意支付它。它是＆＃34;只有＆＃34; 75美元太多了。我从未告诉过什么计算是，总吨等我从未收到过收据苏伊士行驶权，我与奥地兰和罂粟交谈（旁边的船我）他们也比预期的50％。顺便说一下，我们所有人都有预计我们的吨位。而且，我们的计算与美国计算相匹配我们的文档证书。</p><p>  Our first pilot was delightful. His name was Halid. After we got used to thefact that he liked to drive very close to the poles on the left side, werelaxed. He was definitely paying attention to where he was going andwatching/driving carefully. Our whole group was held up when a convoy wascatching us. We anchored in the lake for an hour and had a pleasant conversationwith Halid. He had no problems when we asked him to smoke outside the cockpitand to use the facilities over the side. We had expected to be held up at someof the &#34;stations&#34; and asked for cigarettes. We mentioned this to Halidand none of this happened.</p><p>  我们的第一个飞行员令人愉快。他的名字是黑烟。我们习惯了事实上，他喜欢在左侧靠近杆，我们轻松。他肯定会注意他要去的地方仔细观察/驾驶。我们的整个团队在一个车队的时候被搁置了抓住我们。我们在湖中锚定了一个小时，并有一个愉快的谈话含光拉。当我们让他在驾驶舱外吸烟时，他没有问题并在侧面使用设施。我们预计将被搁置在一些＆＃34;车站＆＃34;并要求香烟。我们提到了光环没有这种情况发生过。</p><p>  We arrived in Ismalia two hours after dark and anchored (the club was full).Halid tried to get a pilot boat to take him off but a friend came by in a dinghyto do it. All the boats had agreed to give the pilots $10. We gave Halid $15 (wethought he was very nice and didn&#39;t ask for a thing and gave us great service, acouple packs of cigarettes (we hadn&#39;t had to use any at the intermediatestations), some crayons, balloons and toys for the kids (we always enjoy sendingstuff to the kids). Halid gave us his phone number and said we should come visitif we get back to Egypt or stay in Ismalia. This was the kind of Egyptianhospitality we had often experienced.</p><p>  我们在黑暗和锚定后两小时到达Ismalia（俱乐部已满）。Halid试图让飞行员乘船带走他，但一个朋友在一个dinghy来去做吧。所有的船只都同意给飞行员10美元。我们给了35美元（我们以为他非常好，并要求一件事情，给我们伟大的服务，一个夫妇的香烟（我们不得不在中间使用任何＆＃39;站点），一些蜡笔，气球和儿童玩具（我们总是喜欢发送给孩子们的东西）。 Halid给了我们他的电话号码，并说我们应该来参观如果我们回到埃及或留在Ismalia。这是那种埃及人热情好客经常经历过。 </p><p>  Around 11pm that night, the Pilot/Police boat came by and asked for our crewlist. No problem. Then, they asked for cigarettes. We gave them a pack. Theyasked for more and we explained we were out. Then, they asked for beer. Theywere getting a bit pushy. We told them we only had one left.</p><p>那天晚上11点左右，飞行员/警察船来了并要求我们的船员列表。没问题。然后，他们要求香烟。我们给了他们一包。他们要求更多，我们解释了我们出来了。然后，他们要求啤酒。他们有点咄咄逼人。我们告诉他们我们只有一个左边。</p><p>  Day 2 of our transit was different. Our pilot was Mohammed, the chief pilot.He was polite and friendly for the first hour. He ask all the right questions tofigure out whether we were wealthy or not and made repeated excuses to try andgo below. We were uncomfortable with his driving as he did not seem to pay muchattention. He weaved all over the place and spent a lot of time writing stuffand keeping track of the other boats. I helped him write down all the boatnames, flags, etc. He spent a lot of time yelling into the radio. One minute hewas friendly, the next he was yelling or complaining about his job. It seems hewas a pilot on large ships where it &#34;was air conditioned, they served greatfood and he didn&#39;t have to drive&#34;. He was very upset when we asked him touse the facilities outside and told us he had never been asked to do this. TheRed Sea Pilot recommends this so we can assume that most boats do this. But, wesimply explained that our toilet was already sealed for our open ocean passageto Cyprus.</p><p>  我们的过境第2天是不同的。我们的飞行员是穆罕默德，首席飞行员。他对第一个小时很有礼貌和友好。他问了所有正确的问题弄清楚我们是否富裕，并使重复的借口试图和走下去。当他似乎没有支付太多时，我们驾驶不舒服注意力。他在整个地方编织，花了很多时间写东西并跟踪另一艘船。我帮助他写下所有的船名字，标志等他花了很多时间大喊大叫。一分钟他很友好，接下来他大喊大叫或抱怨他的工作。看来他似乎是一个在大船上的飞行员，它＆＃34;空调是空调，他们提供了伟大的食物和他不必开车＆＃34;当我们要求他时，他非常沮丧使用外面的设施告诉我们，他从未被要求这样做。这红海飞行员推荐这一点，所以我们可以假设大多数船只这样做。但我们简单地解释说我们的厕所已经被封入我们的开放海洋段落到塞浦路斯。</p><p>  Around noon, we served lunch. At that point, Mohammed was going to let medrive so he could eat. I punched the autopilot. After that, he let me&#34;steer&#34; the rest of the way. We were grateful for that.</p><p>  在中午左右，我们午餐了。那时，穆罕默德会让我开车让他可以吃。我打了自动驾驶仪。之后，他让我＆＃34;转向＆＃34;其余的方式。我们很感激。</p><p>  Mohammed kept asking us to go faster. We were running about 7 knots most ofthe way, close to max for us. I was burning fuel at a ridiculous rate but washappy at that point to do it and get this guy off my boat. About halfway to PortSaid, Mohammed was talking with one of the stations. We got the impression thatwe were about to stop. I put 5 packs of cigarettes on the table, told him thatwas what I had left and said that any packs we had to give out came from those5. About 2 hours south of Port Said, Mohammed told me that if we went faster, wecould avoid having to stop. I cranked it up another 100 rpms to maximum safethrottle and made a show of watching the engine temp carefully. We did not stopat any of the stations.</p><p>  穆罕默德一直要求我们走得更快。我们大部分时间都跑了大约7节对我们来说，靠近最大的方式。我以荒谬的速度燃烧燃料，但是在这一点上幸福，让我的船上得到这个家伙。大约是港口的一半说，穆罕默德正在与其中一个站交谈。我们留下了印象我们即将停止。我把5包在桌子上放了一块香烟，告诉他是我离开的，并说我们不得不发出的任何包装来自那些5.港区以南约2个小时说，穆罕默德告诉我，如果我们走得更快，我们可以避免不得不停下来。我将100个rpms发布到最大的安全扼杀并仔细观察发动机温度。我们没有停止在任何一个站点。</p><p>  Near Port Said, Mohammed talked with customs and told us we might have tostop. He knew that any cigarettes came out of his stash. He had a heck of anargument on the radio. We eventually put a crewlist and a pack of cigarettes anda small weight in a plastic jar and just tossed these to the customs boat.</p><p>  靠近港口说，穆罕默德与习俗交谈并告诉我们我们可能需要停止。他知道任何香烟都从他的藏匿处出来了。他有一个哎呀关于收音机的论点。我们最终填充了船员和一包香烟塑料罐中的一个小重量，只是将这些扔到海关船上。</p><p>  We had been told not to give the pilot their &#34;present&#34; until theywere getting off the boat. Mohammed kept hinting but we found excuses to delay -check engine, make adjustments to the boat, etc. He asked us if we needed thethird pilot and we declined.</p><p>  我们被告知不要给试点他们的＆＃34;现在＆＃34;直到他们下了船。穆罕默德保留暗示，但我们发现借口延迟 - 检查引擎，对船进行调整等。他问我们是否需要第三个飞行员，我们拒绝了。</p><p>  With the pilot boat approaching, we gave him his &#34;present&#34; - $10and the remaining 4 packs of cigarettes. Earlier, he had mentioned that his deafdaughter collected money from other countries. We also gave him a number ofsmall bills from a number of other countries. He tried to hit us up for more butwe held firm. No problem. We gave him two packs of cigarettes for the pilotboat. He was good about holding them up and making sure the pilot boat saw themso they wouldn&#39;t bump us.</p><p>  随着飞行员乘船接近，我们给了他他的＆＃34;现在＆＃34; -  10美元剩下的4包香烟。早些时候，他提到他的聋人女儿从其他国家收集了钱。我们也给了他一些来自其他一些国家的小票据。他试图为我们击中我们，但我们坚持不懈。没问题。我们为飞行员给了他两袋香烟船。他很高兴抱着它们，并确保飞行员看到他们所以他们会＆＃39; t碰到我们。 </p><p>  We went out the harbor entrance and, since it was getting dark and we weretired, we anchored with 2 other boats. Just before midnight, we were awakened bya pilot/patrol boat. They were holding their boat 2-3 feet from ours and shininga huge spotlight in my face. I was instructed to contact Port Said control.Control asked what we were doing, I explained and they said that there was noproblem. Then, the pilot/patrol boat asked for cigarettes. We actually had onepack left and gave it to them. This wasn&#39;t enough for them. They got veryinsistent and told us they needed a pack for each of the 4 people on the boat.The moved their boat right up against us and wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. Itried to contact Port Said Control on the radio but the pilot boat kept keyingtheir mic and preventing me from contacting them. They then turned off theirlights and took off in a hurry but continued to click their mic for 15 minutesas I tried to contact Port Said. We decided we didn&#39;t feel comfortable there sowe left for Cyprus.</p><p>我们出去了海港入口，因为它变得黑暗，我们是累了，我们用2个其他船锚。就在午夜之前，我们被唤醒了飞行员/巡逻艇。他们从我们的船上拿到2-3英尺和闪亮我脸上的一个巨大的聚光灯。我被指示联系端口表示控制。控制问我们在做什么，我解释说，他们说没有问题。然后，飞行员/巡逻艇要求香烟。我们实际上有一个包装留下并给了他们。这不是对他们来说的。他们得到了很多坚持不懈，并告诉我们他们需要一个船上的4人中的每一个包装。将他们的船搬到了美国，并不会答案。一世试图联系端口在收音机上说控制，但导频船保持键控他们的麦克风，阻止我联系它们。然后他们关掉了他们的灯光匆匆起飞，但继续点击他们的麦克风15分钟正如我试图联系口头所说的那样。我们决定我们在那里感到舒适我们离开了塞浦路斯。</p><p>  We had dealt with small amounts of baksheesh and even some minor amounts ofphysical intimidation while visiting Egypt and weren&#39;t terribly bothered butwhat we experienced in the canal transit was excessive and left a bad taste inour mouths. We thoroughly enjoyed the Red Sea and thought about coming back nextseason but we do not want to deal with the canal.</p><p>  我们处理了少量Baksheesh甚至一些少量的在访问埃及和Weren＆＃39; T非常困扰时的身体恐吓我们在运河过境中所经历的是过度的，留下糟糕的味道我们的嘴。我们彻底享受红海，并思考下一步季节，但我们不想处理运河。</p><p>  We recounted our experiences with other boats. Tatanka had no problems witheither pilot, only the overcharging in Port Suez. Piquet&#39;s pilot insisted ondriving the boat into the club in Port Said and ended up hitting the wall. BlownAway II&#39;s pilot ran them aground at almost 7 knots while leaved Ismailia. Theyinsisted on going back to the dock and checking the damage. The pilot - Mohammed- tried to get them to sign a paper in Egyptian that supposedly said they werehappy with his services. They insisted on not transiting until the next day andinsisted on a different pilot.</p><p>  我们讲述了我们与其他船只的经历。 Tatanka没有问题无论是飞行员，只有苏塞港的过充电。 Piquet＆＃39; S飞行员坚持了在港口驾驶船进入俱乐部，并最终击中了墙壁。吹嘘远离II＆＃39; S的飞行员在近7节时搁浅，伊玛利亚近7节。他们坚持回到码头并检查伤害。飞行员 - 穆罕默德 - 试图让他们在埃及人签署一张纸张，据说他们是对自己的服务感到满意。他们坚持不要过境，直到第二天和坚持在不同的飞行员上。</p><p>  Overall, it seems that this year&#39;s experiences were very similar to what waswritten up in last year&#39;s cruising notes.</p><p>  总的来说，似乎今年＆＃39; S的经历非常相似于什么在去年写完＆＃39;巡航笔记。</p><p>  Again, thanks for all your help. We really enjoyed Abu Tig and haverecommended it highly to next year&#39;s group...jpc   Jeff &amp; Gail Sea Witch</p><p>  再次，感谢您的所有帮助。我们真的很喜欢阿布蒂格，并拥有推荐到明年的高度＆＃39; s组... jpc杰夫＆amp; g海女巫 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sailsafely.com/suez_canal.htm">http://www.sailsafely.com/suez_canal.htm</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/私人/">#私人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/suez/">#suez</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/飞行员/">#飞行员</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
