Set in a beautiful neoclassical building that dates to 1812, it was founded on the fortune one man made from his meat juice—which is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>在弗吉尼亚州的里士满，一个名为“情人节”的博物馆讲述了这座城市400年前的故事。它坐落在一座美丽的新古典主义建筑内，建于1812年，它的基础是一个人用他的肉汁制成的财富，这正是它听起来的样子。</p><p> Before it became a museum, The Valentine was the home of dry goods merchant Mann S. Valentine II. In the fall of 1870, Valentine’s wife Anne Maria fell ill, apparently suffering from a “severe and protracted derangement of the organs of digestion,” as Valentine  later wrote. Doctors had given up hope of curing her, and Valentine himself had been holed up in their basement for weeks.</p><p>在成为博物馆之前，瓦伦丁是干货商人曼·S·瓦伦丁二世的家。1870年秋天，瓦伦丁的妻子安妮·玛丽亚病倒了，正如瓦伦丁后来写道的那样，她显然患有“消化器官严重而持久的紊乱”。医生们已经放弃了治愈她的希望，瓦伦丁本人也在他们的地下室里躲藏了好几个星期。</p><p> But when Valentine emerged from the basement, he brought with him a potential cure that he’d cooked up. Knowing that Anne Maria couldn’t stomach solid food, but that she was in desperate need of nutrients, Valentine had concocted a tonic from beef juice and egg whites. The tonic was more effective than beef broth, he reasoned, because boiling meat for broth alters its proteins and leaves it “impaired in value.” By gently cooking the beef at a low temperature and then pressure-cooking it, he extracted juice from the meat that retained more of its nutritional value and “was acceptable to the most irritable stomach,” he wrote.</p><p>但当瓦朗蒂娜从地下室出来时，他带来了一种他精心设计的潜在疗法。瓦伦丁知道安妮·玛丽亚吃不下固体食物，但她急需营养，于是用牛肉汁和蛋清调制了一种补品。他推断，这种补品比牛肉汤更有效，因为将肉煮成肉汤会改变其蛋白质，使其“价值受损”他写道，通过在低温下轻轻烹调牛肉，然后加压烹调，他从肉中提取出的汁液保留了更多的营养价值，并且“对最易过敏的胃来说是可以接受的”。</p><p>  Valentine administered his tonic to Anne Maria, and in the following days, watched as she began to recover. Thrilled with his success, Valentine returned to his basement. He made more meat juice, sent samples off to doctors, and started to bottle and sell the tonic out of his home. Valentine’s Meat Juice company was born.</p><p>瓦朗蒂娜给安妮·玛丽亚服用补药，在接下来的几天里，她开始康复。瓦伦丁为自己的成功而激动，回到了地下室。他制作了更多的肉汁，把样品寄给医生，并开始在家里装瓶销售补品。情人节肉汁公司诞生了。</p><p> “I have been using your ‘Meat Juice’ on different cases in this hospital,” one New York Surgeon wrote to Valentine. “It has more than answered my expectations. I find that patients improve rapidly in appetite and strength under its administration.”</p><p>“我在这家医院的不同病例中使用了你的‘肉汁’，”一位纽约外科医生写信给瓦伦丁。“它远远超出了我的预期。我发现，在它的管理下，患者的食欲和体力迅速改善。”</p><p> By 1874 Valentine had published a booklet filled with similar testimonials from doctors, who swore to its efficacy in curing everything from nausea to dysentery and cholera. Several doctors described administering Valentine’s Meat Juice to patients who refused any other form of nourishment, liquid or solid,  and witnessing signs of recovery.</p><p>到1874年，瓦伦丁已经出版了一本小册子，里面装满了医生们的类似证明，他们发誓它能有效地治疗从恶心到痢疾和霍乱的各种疾病。几位医生描述说，对拒绝任何其他形式的营养（液体或固体）的患者服用情人节肉汁，并看到康复迹象。</p><p> “One of my patients, seriously ill with typhoid fever, was nourished exclusively by it for two weeks, and daily increased in strength from its use, until firmly convalescent,” wrote one Virginia physician.</p><p>一位弗吉尼亚州的医生写道：“我的一位患伤寒的病人，在两周的时间里完全靠它来营养，从使用到完全康复，他的体力每天都在增强。”。</p><p>  “I have found that this preparation stimulates the stomach when enfeebled from almost any cause, not only in dyspepsia and chronic gastritis, but in seasickness, the sickness of pregnancy, and such kindred complications,” another physician wrote. He claimed that he used the tonic by enema, to achieve better absorption, and found that it “exhibits its nutrient qualities in a remarkable degree.”</p><p>另一位医生写道：“我发现，这种制剂在几乎任何原因导致虚弱时都会刺激胃，不仅在消化不良和慢性胃炎中，在晕船、妊娠疾病和类似并发症中也是如此。”。他声称，他通过灌肠来使用补药，以实现更好的吸收，并发现它“在显著程度上展示了其营养品质”</p><p> Another doctor eagerly suggested that Valentine’s Meat Juice be used as a substitute for meals when necessary. “In the hurry of business … many young men are debarred from taking their meals at regular hours, and to remove a sense of hunger or exhaustion, they are led to the use, or abuse, of alcoholic stimulation.” Taking a dram of meat juice instead of whiskey, he wrote, would be far more nutritious and avoid “any of the pernicious effects of the latter.”</p><p>另一位医生急切地建议，必要时可以用情人节肉汁代替正餐。“在匆忙的工作中……许多年轻人被禁止在正常时间吃饭，为了消除饥饿感或疲惫感，他们被引导使用或滥用酒精刺激。”他写道，喝一大杯肉汁而不是威士忌将更有营养，并避免“后者的任何有害影响”</p><p> By the late 1870s, Valentine’s Meat Juice had become one of the most popular and highly available patent medicines around the world. It was a top-selling product in American pharmacies and a fixture in many household medicine cabinets.</p><p>到19世纪70年代末，瓦伦丁肉汁已成为世界上最受欢迎和最易获得的专利药物之一。它是美国药店最畅销的产品，也是许多家用药柜的固定装置。</p><p> “The Meat Juice was incredibly popular the first decade or so that it came out,” says Lauren Gleason, a historian at the  Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Museum in Alexandria, Virginia. “It was one of many pre-manufactured products that you could have bought at your average pharmacy in the late-19th century.”</p><p>弗吉尼亚州亚历山大市Stabler Leadbater药剂师博物馆的历史学家劳伦·格里森（Lauren Gleason）说：“肉汁在问世的头十年左右就非常受欢迎。”。“这是19世纪末你可以在普通药店买到的许多预制产品之一。”</p><p>  The Apothecary Museum is the site of an original apothecary, or pharmacy, where Valentine’s Meat Juice was sold. Visitors often notice a small box in the museum’s collection that carries the Valentine’s Meat Juice label. “[The name] gets a good reaction out of visitors, which is fun,” Gleason says. “They’re like, ‘Ew, what’s that? That’s so gross.’”</p><p>药剂师博物馆是一家原始药剂师或药房的所在地，出售情人节肉汁。参观者经常会注意到博物馆藏品中有一个小盒子，上面贴着情人节肉汁标签。格里森说：“[名字]得到了游客的良好反应，这很有趣。”。“他们会说，‘呃，那是什么？太恶心了。’”</p><p> The preparation of Valentine’s Meat Juice, however, sounds almost savory. “Beef was pressure-cooked and strained to remove its juice, which was then boiled down into a concentrated liquid that was mixed with egg whites, later glycerin,” explains Meg Hughes, director of collections and chief curator at The Valentine. Patients were instructed to take one teaspoon of the protein-rich tonic diluted with two or three tablespoons of water (cold or lukewarm, but not hot). Many people also mixed it into soup or gruel, or if they had especially tender stomachs, into crushed ice.</p><p>然而，情人节肉汁的制作听起来几乎很美味。“牛肉经过压力煮熟和过滤，去除汁液，然后将其煮沸成浓缩液体，再与蛋白、后来的甘油混合，”情人节收藏总监兼首席策展人梅格·休斯解释说。患者被要求服用一茶匙富含蛋白质的补品，并用两到三汤匙水稀释（冷或温水，但不要热）。许多人还将其混合到汤或稀饭中，或者如果他们的胃特别嫩，则将其混合到碎冰中。</p><p> Valentine’s Meat Juice was sold in a tiny brown bottle with a distinctive pear shape. After it achieved commercial success, other companies came out with their own meat-juice knockoffs. To foil copycats, Valentine trademarked the design of his bottle and his logo, which, for unknown reasons, featured a bird’s nest. He also  successfully sued a London company called the Valentine Extract Company of London, which manufactured “meat globules” (similar to bouillon cubes), over its name.</p><p>情人节的肉汁装在一个棕色的小瓶里，瓶里有一个独特的梨形。在取得商业成功后，其他公司推出了自己的仿肉果汁。为了挫败模仿者，瓦伦丁在他的瓶子设计和标识上做了商标，不知为什么，标识上有一个鸟巢。他还成功起诉了一家名为“伦敦瓦伦丁提取物公司”的伦敦公司，该公司生产“肉球”（类似于肉汤块），罪名是该公司的名称。</p><p>  Valentine was also a savvy marketer. He showed up with his meat juice at the International Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1876, determined to get greater visibility for his product. Two years later, he took it all the way to Europe for the Paris Exposition, where Meat Juice made a splash on the world stage.</p><p>瓦伦丁也是一个精明的营销者。1876年，他带着他的肉汁出现在费城的国际博览会上，决心让他的产品更具知名度。两年后，他一路前往欧洲参加巴黎博览会，在那里，肉汁在世界舞台上引起了轰动。</p><p> Back in the United States, Valentine’s Meat Juice saw another boost in popularity in 1881, after the  Boston Medical and Surgical Journal reported that President James A. Garfield took two teaspoons of it with his midday meal while recovering from an assassination attempt. However, Garfield ultimately died from complications arising from the gunshot wound, more than two months after it had been inflicted.</p><p>回到美国，1881年，《波士顿医学与外科杂志》报道，詹姆斯·A·加菲尔德总统在从一次暗杀企图中恢复时，在午餐中吃了两茶匙的情人节肉汁，之后，情人节肉汁的受欢迎程度又得到了提升。然而，加菲尔德最终死于枪伤引发的并发症，这是在枪伤造成两个多月后。</p><p> As for Valentine’s wife, Anne Maria, she lived for two more years after Valentine first revived her with his beef tonic. So did it actually play a role in her recovery that time?</p><p>至于瓦伦丁的妻子安妮·玛丽亚，在瓦伦丁第一次用牛肉补品使她苏醒后，她又活了两年。那这对她当时的康复有影响吗？</p><p> “Of course we can never know if her husband’s tonic was actually effective, but I have to think that the dose of iron Anne Maria ingested in the meat juice could have been beneficial,” says Hughes.</p><p>休斯说：“当然，我们永远无法知道她丈夫的补品是否真的有效，但我不得不认为，在肉汁中摄入一定剂量的铁安妮·玛丽亚可能是有益的。”。</p><p> The 1800s, when Valentine’s Meat Juice came along, was a sketchy time for medicine. There was nothing to stop patent medicine makers like Valentine from making misleading or even false claims about their products. Medical “quackery” was  alive and well, and apothecaries often stocked drugs that were at best ineffective and at worst,  downright dangerous. A patent medicine known as Fulton’s Renal Compound, for example, that claimed to treat kidney disease probably killed more patients than it cured. The 1906 Food &amp; Drug Act, which was the first federal regulation of medicine in the U.S., cracked down on misinformation from the patent medicine industry. Among other things, it required manufacturers to list ingredients on their labels.</p><p>19世纪，当瓦伦丁肉汁出现时，对医学来说是一个粗略的时期。没有什么能阻止瓦伦丁这样的专利药品制造商对其产品做出误导甚至虚假的声明。医学上的“庸医”还活着，而且很健康，药剂师通常储备的药物充其量是无效的，最糟糕的是完全危险的。例如，一种被称为富尔顿肾脏化合物的专利药，声称可以治疗肾病，可能导致更多患者死亡，而不是治愈。1906年的食品与药品展览会；《药品法》是美国第一部联邦药品法规，它打击了专利药品行业的错误信息。除此之外，它还要求制造商在标签上列出成分。</p><p>  Gleason says there was probably nothing nefarious about how Valentine made or marketed his meat juice (and it may even have had mild health benefits). “When the product comes out, it was pre-Food &amp; Drug Act, so there are no regulations that he’s having to adhere to,” she says. “He’s not having to say what was in his product. But it seems that it wasn’t anything terrible. You’d just squeeze a piece of meat, collect the stuff. Cook it.”</p><p>格里森说，瓦伦丁如何制作或销售他的肉汁（甚至可能对健康有轻微的好处）可能没有什么恶意。她说：“当产品上市时，是《食品和药品法》颁布之前，所以他没有必须遵守的规定。”。“他不必说他的产品里有什么。但似乎没什么可怕的。你只要挤一块肉，把东西收起来，煮一下就行了。”</p><p> Sometime after 1906, however, the company rebranded its product as a flavoring for cooking, rather than a health tonic, and Hughes suspects the Food &amp; Drug Act was a factor. By then, Valentine had passed away. His other legacy, The Valentine museum, opened in 1898 and featured art and curios Valentine had collected over the years. Valentine’s Meat Juice remained within his family until it closed in 1986, by which time the product was more commonly found in kitchen pantries than medicine cabinets.</p><p>然而，1906年后的某个时候，该公司将其产品重新命名为烹饪用调味品，而不是健康补品，休斯怀疑该食品&amp；毒品行为是一个因素。那时，瓦伦丁已经去世了。他的另一个遗产是瓦伦丁博物馆，该博物馆于1898年开放，展出了瓦伦丁多年来收藏的艺术品和古董。瓦伦丁的肉汁一直留在他家里，直到1986年关闭。到那时，这种产品更常见于厨房食品间，而不是药柜。</p><p> While Valentine’s Meat Juice evokes an unfamiliar era, it isn’t entirely forgotten. As Hughes notes, there are still plenty of Richmonders who remember seeing it in the grocery store.</p><p>虽然情人节的肉汁让人想起了一个陌生的时代，但它并没有被完全遗忘。正如休斯所指出的，仍然有很多里士满记得在杂货店看到它。</p><p> Gastro Obscura covers the world’s most wondrous food and drink.
