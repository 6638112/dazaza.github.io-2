Whether it’s something as mundane as addresses of railway depots—did you know there was once one  facing City Hall Park?—or as interesting as finding out that Benjamin Franklin conducted electrical experiments from the steeple of the  old Dutch Church (which was, fittingly, later converted into the main post office), guidebooks often contain nuggets of information left out of more conventional histories.</p><p>跳到主要内容作为一个散步导游和历史学家，我发现了一个经常被忽视的来源，了解纽约市是旧指南。无论是MUNDANE作为铁路仓库的地址 - 你知道曾经有一个面向市政府公园吗？ - 唱歌，因为发现本杰明富兰克林从老荷兰教堂的尖顶进行电气实验（这是恰当的，后来转换为主邮局），指南通常包含从更多传统历史中留出的信息块。</p><p> One day, as I was reading the 1866 edition of  one such guide,  Miller’s New York As It Is; or Stranger’s Guide to the Cities of New York, Brooklyn, and Adjacent Places, I noticed an addendum at the back of the book called &#34;Supplemental Hints.&#34; The book had come out sporadically since 1859; in this edition, author/publisher James Miller had included, for the first time, suggestions for how visitors could create their own walking tour of the city.</p><p> 有一天，正如我正在阅读1866年版的一个这样的指导，米勒的纽约;或陌生人指南，纽约，布鲁克林和邻近地区的城市，我注意到这本书后面的成本＆＃34;补充暗示。＆＃34;自1859年以来，这本书偶尔出来了;在本版中，作者/出版商James Miller首次包括参观者如何创造自己的徒步旅行的建议。</p><p> Miller—mindful that a &#34;tour of the entire city would be a too arduous performance for a pedestrian&#34;—instead advised his reader &#34;to limit his perambulations to Broadway, from the Bowling Green to Union Square.&#34;</p><p> 毫无思想的是一个＆＃34;整个城市的巡演将是一个太艰苦的行人＆＃34; -instead建议他的读者＆＃34;将他的幽灵限制在百老汇，从保龄球绿化到联合广场。 ＆＃34;</p><p> What would it be like, I wondered, to walk the streets of New York with an 1866 guidebook in my hand? How much of Miller’s city still exists? I downloaded  New York As It Is onto my iPad and prepared to find out.</p><p> 我想知道，在我手中使用1866指南沿着纽约的街道走了什么样的？米勒城市仍然存在多少？我下载了纽约，因为它是我的iPad并准备好了解。</p><p>  Before I left, I first wanted to see how Miller’s book compared with his competitors’. Though guidebooks to the city have been around since at least 1817, when Edmund Blunt published his   Stranger’s Guide to the City of New York, the era around the Civil War saw a proliferation of titles.</p><p>  在我离开之前，我第一次想看看米勒的书与他的竞争对手相比如何。虽然自从至少1817年以来，埃德蒙钝性迄今为止，虽然引导到城市以来一直存在于纽约市的陌生人指南，但内战周围的时代举行了冠军。</p><p> Miller’s main rival seems to have been   Lloyd’s Pocket Companion and Guide Through New York City, 1866-67, which is made up exclusively of seven walking tour itineraries. These walks were purportedly compiled by a native New Yorker named John Wetherby, though I have found no evidence that such a person ever existed. Wetherby’s first walking tour itinerary turned out to be very similar to Miller’s—a stroll up Broadway from Battery Park.</p><p> 米勒的主要竞争对手似乎是Lloyd的口袋伴侣和指导通过1866  -  67年纽约市，它专门由七个散步旅游行程组成。这些散步据称是一个名叫约翰·韦比特的本地人纽约人编制，尽管我发现没有证据表明这样的人存在。 Wetherby的第一个步行旅游行程结果与米勒的百老汇从电池公园漫步非常相似。</p><p>  The  Pocket Companion’s conversational style reminded me of a book I’d unearthed during my research into the history of  West Broadway, a guidebook written before the Civil War. Titled   Glimpses of New-York by a South Carolinian (Who Had Nothing Else to Do), the book came out in 1852 with the goal of proving to Southern readers that New York was just as wretched as they expected it to be. It seemed like the perfect antidote to the native boosterism of my other two guides.</p><p>  口袋伴侣的会话风格让我想起了一本书，我在研究西百老汇历史时出土，这是一个在内战前写的指南。由南卡罗林（别无别可做的纽约州的纽约瞥见，这本书于1852年出版，目的是向南方读者证明纽约就像他们预期的那样。似乎是我其他两个指南的原生助推器的完美解毒剂。 </p><p> Then, because I couldn’t help myself, I downloaded another book called  Phelps’ New York City Guide (1867). And then  A Picture of New York (1848);  The Stranger’s Hand-Book for the City of New York; or, What to See, and How to See It (1854);  Nelson’s Guide to the City of New York and its Neighbourhood (1859); and  Appleton’s Illustrated Hand-Book of American Travel: The Eastern and Middle States and the British Provinces (1860).</p><p>然后，因为我无法帮助自己，我下载了另一本名为菲尔普斯的纽约市指南（1867年）的书。然后是纽约的照片（1848年）;陌生人为纽约市的手写;或者，看看，以及如何看待它（1854年）;尼尔森纽约市和其附近的指南（1859年）;和Appleton的插图的美国旅行手册：东部和中美和英国省（1860年）。</p><p> Finally, armed with more mid-19th-century guides than any reasonable person should read, I was ready to set out.</p><p> 最后，与任何合理的人都应该阅读，武装更多的19世纪中期的指南，我已经准备好了。</p><p>  Seeing as how the  Pocket Companion is not only exactly 150 years old, but also the only book in my arsenal entirely devoted to walking tours, I decide to use its &#34;Walk the First&#34; to structure my itinerary, supplementing from  New York As It Is,  Glimpses of New-York,  and the other guides as necessary.</p><p>  看到作为口袋伴侣的口袋伴侣的速度不仅仅是150岁，而且我的阿森纳里唯一的书也完全致力于徒步旅行，我决定使用它的＆＃34;走第一＆＃34;建立我的行程，从纽约补充，因为它是纽约的瞥见，以及必要的其他指南。</p><p>  As I take the No. 1 train downtown, I read the introduction to the  Pocket Companion, which begins with a section called &#34;Why It Was Written.&#34; After the narrator introduces himself as John Wetherby, he announces:</p><p>  当我接受第1次火车市中心时，我读到了口袋伴侣的介绍，以叫做＆＃34;为什么写的。＆＃34;在叙述者介绍了自己作为John Wetherby的人之后，他宣布：</p><p> Walking is my delight. Often, stick in hand, do I start out on a morning, and roam about the whole long day, viewing the various places of interest, and noting down in my memory any curious or quaint story.</p><p> 走路是我的喜悦。经常，粘在手中，我一天早上开始，并漫游整整漫长的一天，观看各种感兴趣的地方，并在我的记忆中记下任何好奇或古怪的故事。</p><p> Wetherby realizes that his vast stores of knowledge would help visitors; lo and behold, an old friend, Jonathan Griggs, immediately shows up at his doorstep looking for a place to stay. Wetherby seizes on the opportunity to show his friend around; for a week, they set off on a different walk each morning, each becoming one of the  Pocket Companion’s seven itineraries. Each walk is told as a conversation between the two men: Griggs, the country rube, asks all sorts of leading questions; Wetherby, of course, has all the answers.</p><p> Wetherby意识到他的广阔知识商店将有助于访客; Lo和Behold，一位老朋友Jonathan Griggs，立即在他的门口寻找寻找一个留下的地方。 Wetherby抓住机会向周围展示他的朋友;每周一周，每天早上散步，每个人都成为一个口袋伴侣的七分之一。每次散步都被告知这两个人之间的谈话：葡萄牙葡萄酒，鲁布，询问各种各样的领先问题;当然，Wetherby拥有所有答案。</p><p> &#34;Walk The First&#34; begins with Griggs and Wetherby deposited by horse-drawn stagecoach at Battery Park; unable to catch a stagecoach, I instead exit the subway at South Ferry and make my way to their first stop: Castle Clinton, then known as Castle Garden.</p><p> ＆＃34;走第一个＆＃34;从电池公园的马拉架子存放的Griggs和Wetherby开始;无法抓住驿马目，而是在南渡轮退出地铁，并达到他们的第一站：城堡克林顿，随后被称为城堡花园。 </p><p>  &#34;I have heard of that before,&#34; Griggs tells Wetherby in the book, in an example of what will become their usual banter. &#34;When Jenny Lind came to this country, she made her first appearance there.&#34; The book goes on to note &#34;Griggs was delighted at his knowledge.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我之前听说过，＆＃34; Griggs在这本书中告诉Wetherby，在将成为他们通常的戏剧性的例子中。 ＆＃34;当Jenny Lind来到这个国家时，她在那里做了第一次出现。＆＃34;这本书继续说明＆＃34;格里格斯对他的知识很高兴。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;It was one time a fortification, but now it is devoted to more peaceful pursuits, being used as an emigrant depot.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;这是一个设防，但现在它致力于更平和的追求，被用作移民仓库。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;Yes, every one of them. It is an excellent institution, and saves many a poor person from being robbed of all they possess in the world.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;是的，每个人。这是一个很好的机构，并拯救了许多穷人被抢劫他们在世界上拥有的所有人。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;In former times the emigrant, as soon as the ship touched the dock, was dumped out upon the pier like so much merchandise, and made to shift for himself the best way he could. Sharpers were on the watch for him; he was robbed and cheated in every direction; and in a few hours he had not a cent left to bless himself with.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;在船舶触摸码头时，在前次移民，就像这么多商品一样倾倒在码头上，并使自己成为他能够的最佳方式。尖锐的人在手表上;他被抢劫并欺骗了每个方向;在几个小时内，他没有留下一分钱祝福自己。＆＃34;</p><p> Most of the  Pocket Companion continues in this fashion: Griggs is inordinately proud of himself for knowing some fact or figure about New York, but Wetherby is always there to prove he knows more.</p><p> 大多数口袋伴侣以这种方式持续下去</p><p> It would be the equivalent today of having the subway run at grade level down the middle of the street.</p><p> 今天的地铁在街道中间的级别跑步时，这将是相同的。</p><p> These conversations are generally accurate.  Castle Clinton was a fortification, built for the War of 1812. As a theater, it did host Jenny Lind; it was then the state-run Emigrant Landing Depot, which it would remain until 1889, when the federal government took over the job of processing incoming passengers.</p><p> 这些对话通常是准确的。城堡克林顿是一个设防，为1812年战争而建造的。作为一部剧院，它确实主持了珍妮林德;然后，当联邦政府接管加工来乘客的工作时，它将留在1889年之前的国立移民着陆仓库。 </p><p>  Following Griggs and Wetherby’s itinerary, my next stop is Bowling Green, where there &#34;was once a leaden statue of George III, which, at the commencement of the Revolution, was torn down and moulded into bullets.&#34;</p><p>在格里格斯和Wetherby的行程之后，我的下一站是保龄球绿色，那里的人和＃34;曾经是乔治三世的领导雕像，这在革命的开始时，被撕毁并塑造成子弹。＆＃34;</p><p> Griggs, however, is more fascinated by the sheer number of horse-drawn omnibuses surrounding the small park than in  hearing about King George. It can be hard for the modern New Yorker to imagine just how much worse traffic in the city was 150 years ago, but—as Wetherby points out—&#34;nearly seven hundred stages [went] up and down Broadway daily,&#34; with each one making &#34;ten trips per diem&#34; for a total of &#34;seven thousand stages daily for the use of our citizens.&#34; It would be the equivalent today of having the subway run at grade level down the middle of the street.</p><p> 然而，格里格斯对小公园周围的马拉·综合数量比听到乔治王的纯粹数量令人着迷。现代纽约人可能很难想象城市的流量在150年前，但 - 因为Wetherby指出 - ＆＃34;近七百个阶段[去了百老汇日常，＆＃ 34;每一个制作和＃34;每日迪姆＆＃34的十次旅行;总共＆＃34;每天七千阶段用于使用我们的公民。＆＃34;今天的地铁在街道中间的级别跑步时，这将是相同的。</p><p> Fourteen years earlier, the Southern author of  Glimpses of New-York had noted that &#34;[Broadway] has become quite difficult to cross ... and whenever attempted it is at the peril of your life or limbs.&#34; The traffic problem would take generations to improve. In 1885, nearly two decades after the  Pocket Companion’s release,  engineer Francis V. Greene still counted nearly 8,000 horse-drawn vehicles pass him as he stood at the corner of Broadway and Pine Street.</p><p> 纽约瞥见的南方作者已注意到，＆＃34; [百老汇]已经变得非常困难......每当尝试它都处于生命或肢体的危险。＆＃34;交通问题将需要几代改善。 1885年，在口袋伴侣的释放后近二十年，工程师弗朗西斯V.Grege仍然计算近8,000辆马拉车辆，因为他站在百老汇和松树街的拐角处。</p><p> But the  Pocket Companion’s  Griggs has little time to ponder the wondrous traffic; soon Wetherby is whisking him up to the top of the steeple of Trinity Church. Though I follow in their footsteps, I have to be content with the view from across the street—the steeple has been  closed to visitors since 1883.</p><p> 但是口袋伴侣的格里格斯几乎没有时间思考奇妙的交通;很快，Wetherby正在将他搅打到三位一体教堂的尖顶。虽然我追随他们的脚步声，但我必须在街对面的视野中满足 - 自1883年以来，尖顶已关闭到游客。</p><p> Back in the 1860s, a visit to Trinity’s spire—then the tallest tower in the city—was the one constant in every guidebook. As Miller notes in  New York As It Is:</p><p> 在1960年代回来，访问Trinity的Spire-The The City中最高的塔 - 每个导游中的一个常量。作为纽约的米勒笔记，因为它是：</p><p> By way of introduction to the city in detail, we recommend the visitor first get a bird’s-eye view of it from the steeple of Trinity church. A view from this elevation, over 320 feet in height [ Note: the spire is only 284 feet tall], affords a good idea of the general extent and topography of the city. The tower is accessible to the public any time of the day excepting the hours devoted to divine service ….</p><p> 通过详细介绍城市，我们推荐访客首先从三位一体教堂的尖端获得鸟瞰图。从这个高度的看法，高度超过320英尺[注意：尖顶只有284英尺高]，为城市的一般程度和地形提供了一个好主意。除了致力于神圣服务的时间之外，公众可以访问塔楼。</p><p>  As we … cast our eyes upon the stores and warehouses, many of them filled to depletion with the products of every nation upon the earth, brought hither by those very ships we now see fringing the shore, we can scarcely believe that a little over 230 years ago the whole of this island was purchased of the Indians for a sum equivalent to twenty-four dollars. Yet so it was.</p><p>  当我们施到储存和仓库时，他们中的许多人都充满了地球上每艘全国的产品的耗尽，我们现在看到了我们现在看到环绕着岸边的那些船只，我们几乎不相信230多个多年前，这个岛上被印第安人购买了相当于二十四美元的金额。然而它是。 </p><p> When the  Pocket Companion came out, that $24 figure was only about four decades old, so it’s notable how quickly it became enshrined in the city’s lore. The dollar amount was calculated by state historian John Romeyn Brodhead in 1826, and was, even then, essentially meaningless. It’s better to  think of Colonial prices in terms of purchasing power; what the Dutch paid for the island of Manhattan in 1626 would have also bought them 2,400 tankards of beer—a bargain, but not $24.</p><p>当口袋伴侣出来时，24美元的数字只有四十年的历史，所以这是值得注意的是，在这个城市的洛洛中所在的速度是多么迅速。美元金额由国家历史学家约翰罗美大学在1826年计算出来，甚至那么毫无意义。在购买力方面思考殖民价格更好; 1626年为曼哈顿岛支付的荷兰人还购买了2,400桶啤酒的讨价还价，而不是24美元。</p><p>  Up to this point, Miller’s walk in  New York As It Is and Wetherby’s have been basically the same. Miller doesn’t bother with Castle Garden (which he derides as having &#34;little architectural beauty to boast&#34;), but starts at Bowling Green before heading to Trinity. He then suggests the natural detour down Wall Street. Wetherby, by contrast, won’t be diverted from his route up Broadway, promising Griggs they’ll come back another day.</p><p>  到目前为止，米勒在纽约散步，因为它和Wetherby已经基本相同。米勒不打扰城堡花园（他嘲笑为＆＃34;小建筑美容吹嘘＆＃34;），但在前往Trinity之前从保龄球开始。然后他建议自然绕道街道。相比之下，瓦尔比比不会从百老汇的路线上转移，承诺咧嘴笑容他们会再次回来。</p><p> I choose to follow Miller’s route, first heading down to Federal Hall, then known simply as the United States Treasury. Built in 1842 by the architectural firm Town &amp; Davis, it served as the federal Custom House before that department moved down the street to the old Merchant’s Exchange at 55 Wall Street in 1862. Miller steers his visitors from the Treasury to 55 Wall and then back to Broadway to see the various banks at the heart of the Financial District. In the middle of the work day, Wall Street was even then one of the city’s most crowded thoroughfares: Miller warns walkers that at &#34;every moment&#34; they &#34;are in danger of being jostled or pushed aside by … crowds of pedestrians, all eagerly in pursuit of something.&#34;</p><p> 我选择关注米勒的路线，首先向联邦大厅前进，然后被称为美国财政部。建于1842年由建筑公司镇＆amp;戴维斯，它曾担任联邦定制房子，然后在1862年在55华尔街迁至旧商人的交流。米勒将他的访客从库里队到55墙，然后回到百老汇，看到各种银行看到各种银行金融区的核心。在工作日中间，华尔街甚至是该市最拥挤的通道之一：Miller警告＆＃34;每一刻＆＃34;他们＆＃34;有危险的危险被赶出或推开......人群的人群，都热切地追求一些东西。＆＃34;</p><p>  As I return to Broadway, I pick up Wetherby’s narrative; he is busy showing Griggs around Trinity’s cemetery, including the graves of Alexander Hamilton, Commodore James &#34;Don’t Give Up the Ship&#34; Lawrence, and Lieutenant Ludlow. The first two I’ve visited often, but I confess that I had to look up the last one; it turns out Ludlow was Lawrence’s second-in-command on the   USS Chesapeake and is buried alongside his commanding officer.</p><p>  当我返回百老汇时，我拿起Wetherby的叙述;他正忙着展示Trinity的公墓周围的Griggs，包括亚历山大·汉密尔顿，Commodore James＆＃34的坟墓;不要放弃船＆＃34;劳伦斯和卢德洛中尉。我经常访问的前两个，但我承认我必须仰望最后一个;事实证明，Ludlow是劳伦斯在USS Chesapeake上的第二个指挥，并埋在他的指挥官。</p><p> After admonishing Griggs not to give to beggars on the street but instead to charity (some things never change), Wetherby has to rescue his companion from nearly being trampled by a horse. The entire incident seems to have been concocted for two reasons: one, as a warning for out-of-towners to look where they’re going; two, so that Wetherby can introduce Griggs—and his readers—to the first of many stores the two will visit on their walk: Knox’s Great Hat and Cap Establishment.</p><p> 在劝告Griggs不要在街上乞丐而且慈善机构（一些事情永远不会改变），Wetherby必须拯救他的伴侣，几乎被马践踏。整个事件似乎已经被解雇了两个原因：一，作为向外推送人员的警告看他们要去的地方;二，因此，Wetherby可以介绍格里格斯 - 他的读者 - 到了许多商店的第一个将访问他们的步行：诺克斯的大帽子和帽子。</p><p> I have no idea if the  Pocket Companion’s publisher, Thomas Lloyd, solicited these advertisements as product placements, but as Wetherby and Griggs make their way up Broadway, they stop into everything from a billiard table factory to a drugstore to two different sewing machine shops. When Wetherby describes these spots to Griggs, he’s sometimes quoting verbatim from the advertisements. Alas, though the modern-day walker can visit many trendy shops along the same stretch of Broadway—shops that continue to lure tourists from around the world—none of the places mentioned in the  Pocket Companion still exist, at least not in their 1866 locations.</p><p> 我不知道Pocket Companion的出版商，托马斯劳伊德，招揽这些广告作为产品展示位置，但由于Wetherby和Griggs向百老汇开始了，他们从台球台工厂停下来到药店到两种不同的缝纫机商店。当Wetherby将这些斑点描述为Griggs时，他有时会引用广告中的逐字。唉，虽然现代化的沃克可以沿着相同的百老汇商店探望许多时尚的商店，但在世界各地的游客继续诱惑游客 - 没有在口袋伴侣中提到的地方仍然存在，至少不是在他们的1866个地点。</p><p> Leaving Knox’s with a new cap, Wetherby and Griggs stop at St. Paul’s Chapel,  having first glanced at the still-under-construction  New York Herald building across the street. What Wetherby fails to mention is that the site of the  Herald had for many years been occupied by P.T. Barnum’s American Museum, which burned to the ground in a spectacular fire a year earlier, in 1865. (Earlier guidebooks grudgingly acknowledge Barnum’s success; as  Francis’s New Guide to the Cities of New-York and Brooklyn put it, &#34;the wonders contained in which building none but a Barnum could either have collected … or can adequately describe.&#34;)</p><p> 在圣保罗教堂留下了新的帽子，Wetherby和Griggs停在圣保罗的教堂，首先瞥了一眼街对面的纽约州纽约海纹大楼。 Wetherby未能提及的是，预示的网站已经被P.T占领了多年。 Barnum的美国博物馆在1865年之前在壮观的火灾中烧毁了地面。包含在哪个建筑物中，除了巴纳姆可以收集......或者可以充分描述。＆＃34;） </p><p> It’s at this spot that I realize that using the  Pocket Companion as my guide was the right choice. The walking tour in Miller’s  New York As It Is would have had its readers searching in vain for Barnum’s Museum. James Miller, I later discover, wasn’t very good at updating his guide.  New York As It Is continued to be published through the early 1880s, but critics complained that he was still describing the city as it had looked in 1859, when the first edition came out.</p><p>在这个地方，我意识到使用口袋伴侣作为我的指导是正确的选择。米勒纽约的徒步旅行，因为它的读者将在徒劳的博物馆中寻找徒劳的博物馆。 James Miller，我后来发现，在更新他的指导时并不是很好。纽约州继续发表于1880年代初，但批评者抱怨说，当第一版出来时，他仍然在1859年看着这座城市。</p><p> At St. Paul’s, Wetherby and Griggs visit George Washington’s pew, along with the tombs of General Richard Montgomery, who died at the Battle of Quebec in 1775, Robert Emmet  (&#34;the Irish patriot&#34;), and actor George Frederick Cooke, all of which are still visible in the church and yard, but none of which draw many people—certainly not compared to the crowds that flock to Alexander Hamilton’s grave down the street.</p><p> 在圣保罗，Wetherby和Griggs参观乔治华盛顿的PEW，以及罗伯特·埃尔穆格（＆＃34;爱尔兰爱国者＆＃34;）和演员乔治Frederick Cooke，所有这些都在教堂和院子里仍然可见，但其中没有人吸引许多人 - 肯定没有与群岛朝向街道朝向亚历山大·汉密尔顿的坟墓的人群相比。</p><p>  After a quick stop at the now-demolished Astor Hotel—where Wetherby writes that &#34;the thirsty can bibulate and the hungry can be fed (if their impecuniosity is not too great to prevent them)&#34;—they continue to City Hall Park  and its Croton Aqueduct fountain (replaced in 1872). In the bad old days, Wetherby tells Griggs,</p><p>  经过快速停在现在拆除的阿斯特酒店 -  Whertingby写道，其中＆＃34;口渴可以培养和饥饿可以喂食（如果他们的个人心脏不是太大而无法阻止它们）＆＃34;  - 他们继续市政厅公园及其巴豆渡槽喷泉（于1872年取代）。在糟糕的旧天里，Wetherby告诉Griggs，</p><p> visitors from the country were often fleeced by sharpers when they attempted to enter any one of the park gates. One of these scamps would accost the stranger and demand money for admittance, which the stranger, not being accustomed to the ways and manners of New York, would incontinently pay.</p><p> 当他们试图进入任何一个公园大门时，来自该国的游客往往被尖锐的人羊毛。其中一个斯巴斯人会加强陌生人和需求为入场的资金，这是陌生人，没有习惯于纽约的方式和方式，将无法支付。</p><p> City Hall Park’s poor reputation would endure for over a century. As recently as the 1980s, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern was  calling it a &#34;shabby, rundown patch of grass and roots surrounding a parking lot.&#34; Part of the park’s downfall came in 1869, when the lower quadrant was taken over by construction of the new main post office, finished in 1880. The post office stood until 1938 (when it was superseded by the current building on Eighth Avenue), and it took 50 years from its demolition for the park to recover.</p><p> 市政厅公园的声誉很差，持续多个世纪。最近，作为20世纪80年代，公园委员亨利J.斯特恩正在呼叫它A＆＃34;破旧，围绕停车场的草和根的破旧补丁。＆＃34; 1869年，当时，当地象限被新的主邮局建造，1880年完成，这部分公园的垮台。邮局直到1938年（当前建筑物在第八大道上的当前建筑物取代时，邮局从拆除公园拆除了50年的时间来恢复。</p><p> The next stop in the  Pocket Companion is City Hall  itself, which, like Trinity Church, is one of the &#34;must-see&#34; sights of Lower Manhattan in every 19th-century guidebook. In  New York As It Is, Miller calls the building, constructed at great expense from 1803 to 1810, &#34;an imposing edifice,&#34; but saves most of his praise for the clock in the cupola. Wetherby similarly tries to impress his visitor with the massive timepiece:</p><p> Pocket Companion中的下一站是City Hall本身，如Trinity Church，它是＆＃34;必看＆＃34;每一19世纪指南中达曼哈顿的景点。在纽约，米勒呼叫建筑物，以1803年至1810年以1803年的牺牲品，＆＃34;一个巨大的大厦，＆＃34;但节省了他对圆顶时钟的大部分赞美。 Wetherby同样尝试用大规模钟表留下深刻的印象：</p><p> &#34;New York time is governed by that clock. I presume that every man who possesses a watch, and whose business is down town, regulates his timepiece by it. It originally cost $4,000.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;纽约时间受到该时钟的管辖。我认为每个拥有手表的人，谁的业务都在镇上，规范了他的钟表。它最初耗资4,000美元。＆＃34; </p><p>  &#34;True; but then it’s a good clock for the price. The main wheels of it are two feet six inches in diameter, and the pendulum-bob weighs three hundred pounds.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;真;但是这是一个好时钟的价格。它的主轮直径为两英尺6英寸，摆锤鲍勃重量为三百磅。＆＃34;</p><p> Nearly all of this conversation seems like it is cribbed from  New York As It Is.  Indeed, despite Wetherby’s early boast about how much he knows about New York, the deeper one delves into the  Pocket Companion, the more apparent it becomes that the material is cobbled together from other guidebooks, and—like the language lifted directly from advertisements—put into quotes as dialogue between the two characters.</p><p> 几乎所有这次谈话似乎都是从纽约瘫痪。事实上，尽管他早早吹嘘了他对纽约的多大了解，但更深入的人进入口袋伴侣，这就是将材料从其他指南中拼凑的更明显，类似于直接从广告举起的语言在两个角色之间的对话中的引号。</p><p>  (By the way,  the clock and cupola were restored and rebuilt in 1998 during the Giuliani administration.)</p><p>  （顺便说一下，在Giuliani管理期间，1998年恢复并重建时钟和圆顶。）</p><p> Before leaving City Hall Park, Wetherby takes Griggs to see what he calls &#34;the new City Hall … larger and more commodious than the present one.&#34;</p><p> 在离开市政厅公园之前，Wetherby需要Griggs看他所说的话和＃34;新的市政厅......比现在更大，更宽敞的夸张。＆＃34;</p><p> New City Hall? I knew that at the turn of the 20th century, the city flirted with the idea of building a new government building, which ultimately became Surrogate’s Court instead. But I had never heard of a new City Hall under construction in 1866.</p><p> 新的市政厅？我知道在20世纪之交，这座城市与建设新政府大楼的想法调情，最终成为代理人的法院。但我从未听说过1866年的一个新的市政厅。</p><p> &#34;The corner-stone,&#34; Wetherby explains, &#34;was laid in 1862, and there is no doubt that 1867 will see the completion of the building.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;角落石，＆＃34; Wetherby解释说，＆＃34;在1862年奠定了举行，毫无疑问，1867年将看到建筑物的完成。＆＃34;</p><p> Wetherby is actually talking about the Tweed Courthouse, the greatest boondoggle in New York’s history and the building that ultimately brought down William M. &#34;Boss&#34; Tweed. In hindsight, Wetherby’s prediction that the building would be finished in 1867 seems like impossibly wishful thinking. By the time Tweed was arrested for fraud in 1871, the exterior of the building was standing but little else had been finished.</p><p> Wetherby实际上正在谈论Tweed Courthouse，这是纽约历史的最伟大的营业力，最终带来William M.＆＃34; BOSS＆＃34; Tweed。在后威尔，Wetherby的预测，建筑物在1867年将在不可思议的一厢情愿的思考。当Tweed于1871年被欺诈被捕，建筑物的外部是站立的，但别无他完成。 </p><p> The frauds involved in this project  are legendary: for example, Andrew Garvey, who was the building’s plasterer, was paid $133,187 for two days’ work. That sum was more than half the building’s original budget. After Tweed’s downfall, architect Leopold Eidlitz expanded and finished the structure, which now serves as the headquarters for the city’s Board of Education.</p><p>该项目涉及的欺诈是传奇的：例如，作为建筑物的石膏机的安德鲁加维是支付了133,187美元的两天工作。这笔总和超过了建筑的原始预算的一半。在Tweed的垮台之后，建筑师Leopold Eidlitz扩大并完成了该结构，现在是该市教育委员会的总部。</p><p>  Up to this point on my walk, with the exception of the Astor Hotel, the  New York Herald building, and the old fountain in City Hall Park, everything on Wetherby’s itinerary still stands. Miller’s book would have shown me some banks and newspaper offices that are now gone, but it’s still remarkable that what was considered noteworthy in the Financial District 150 years ago are the same sites people visit today.</p><p>  截至我散步的这一点，除了纽约先驱大厦和市政厅公园的旧喷泉，距离Wetherby的行程中的一切都仍然存在。 Miller的书将向我向我展示了一些现在已经消失的银行和报纸办事处，但在150年前的金融区被认为是值得注意的仍然是显着的。</p><p> North of Chambers Street, however, the tours fall apart. While A.T. Stewart’s Marble Palace (a &#34;great emporium of costly shawls, satins, silks, brocades, &amp;c.&#34;) still stands at the northeast corner of Broadway and Chambers Street—filled mostly with New York City government offices—almost all of the other locations that  New York As It Is and the  Pocket Companion point out are long gone.</p><p> 然而，北朝北街道，旅游突出了。虽然A.T. Stewart的大理石宫（A＆＃34;昂贵的披肩，缎子，丝绸，锦缎，＆amp; c。＆＃34;）仍然位于百老汇的东北角，街头街头街头大部分与纽约市政府办公室 - 最多的所有其他地方，纽约和口袋伴侣指出很长一点。</p><p> There are a couple of exceptions. Wetherby and Griggs stop for lunch at Taylor’s Saloon, which was housed in the ground floor of the International Hotel at the corner of Franklin Street. Wetherby explains it is &#34;the favorite resort … of the fashion and  elite of New York,&#34; pointing out the variegated marble flooring and the $3,500 ceiling embellishments. Alas, Taylor’s is  all but gone today. When the building was &#34;renovated&#34; in 2010, only a smattering of original architectural details were preserved.</p><p> 有几个例外。 Wetherby和Griggs在泰勒的轿车停留午餐，该午餐在富兰克林街的拐角处于国际大酒店的底楼。 Wetherby解释了它是＆＃34;最喜欢的度假村......时尚和精英的纽约，＆＃34;指出杂色的大理石地板和3,500美元的天花板装饰。唉，Taylor今天都是消失的。当建筑物＆＃34;翻新＆＃34; 2010年，只保留了对原始建筑细节的讽刺。</p><p> Sometimes history repeats itself; though the specific store may be gone, as Wetherby and Griggs stroll through what we call Soho, Griggs opines, &#34;here on Broadway a man can obtain everything he wants. Let him make known his wishes, whether an article of luxury or necessity, and he can be supplied without leaving the street.&#34;</p><p> 有时历史重复自己;虽然特定的商店可能已经消失，因为wetherby和griggs漫步通过我们所说的萨哈，格里格斯·鸦片，＆＃34;在百老汇，一个人可以获得他想要的一切。让他知道他的愿望，无论是奢侈品还是必要的，他都可以在没有离开街道的情况下提供。＆＃34;</p><p> In  New York As It Is, James Miller points out Haughwout &amp; Co., which today stands as one of the  finest cast-iron structures in Soho; both books note the St. Nicholas Hotel, one small portion of which (521-523 Broadway) today houses a Lady Footlocker, but the next real point of interest that I can actually step inside is Grace Church, at the corner of 10th Street. Miller first praises the James Renwick-designed structure as &#34;the most ornate of the ecclesiastical buildings&#34; in the city before noting it contains &#34;a little too much theatrical glitter in the interior, to comport with the chastened solemnities of religious worship.&#34;</p><p> 在纽约，詹姆斯米勒指出了Haughwout＆amp;公司，今天是苏哈中最好的铸铁结构之一;两本书都注意到圣尼古拉斯酒店，一小部分（521-523百老汇）今天拥有一位女士脚道，但下一个真正的兴趣点，我实际上可以走内部是恩典教堂，在第10街的拐角处。米勒首先赞扬詹姆斯·伦维克设计的结构和＃34;最具华丽的教会建筑＆＃34;在这座城市之前，它在注意它包含＆＃34;在内部有点太多戏剧闪光，与宗教崇拜的惩罚庄严争论。＆＃34;</p><p> Both tours then bring walkers to the equestrian statue of</p><p> 然后两次旅游都将步行者带到马术雕像 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://ny.curbed.com/2016/7/27/12278588/new-york-city-historic-guidebooks-walking-tour">https://ny.curbed.com/2016/7/27/12278588/new-york-city-historic-guidebooks-walking-tour</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/指南/">#指南</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/walking/">#walking</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/纽约/">#纽约</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
