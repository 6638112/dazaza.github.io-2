Nowadays? Not so much.  I know, I know. Grumpy old gits are a dime a dozen, and their views about the past are often filtered through a golden haze of blissful forgetfulness and nostalgia. This is of course the case for me, too, but I still think the point is valid: computers used to be much cooler - by orders of magnitude - than they are now.  The situation can perhaps be explained by an analogy: You&#39;ve got a rusty old 1994 FIAT Punto and there is a rather pressing need for you to invest in a new vehicle. Of course, you can dream big - maybe you&#39;d like some kind of armoured personnel carrier, perhaps a souped-up, pimped-out Tesla with all the bells and whistles or why not a Ferrari? Realistically, though, you&#39;re probably considering something along the lines of a brand new Ford: the kind of sensible family car that would still be an upgrade to the withering piece of junk you&#39;re currently driving. And, as soon as you&#39;ve amassed enough funds, that&#39;s probably what you&#39;re going to buy. That APC, though... Man, how sweet would it be to drive one of those? Just thundering through morning traffic, fist pumping in the air, shouting crude insults at that guy with the SUV who always cuts in front of you at the intersection down by the grocery store. Not so smug now, eh, Mr. Sports Utility?  That&#39;s what it used to be like with computers.  Don&#39;t get me wrong. You can spend nearly infinite amounts of money on a computer if you&#39;d like to - it&#39;s always been like that and probably will be for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for supercomputer clusters used in science and the mainframes keeping the banks and stock markets ticking. But when dreaming about computer power, few of us imagine having access to a behemoth like that. The things we do with our machines can only go faster up to a certain point, unless we dabble in computational biology in our spare time. It would be like replacing our feeble FIAT with an aircraft carrier: sure, it&#39;s powerful, but it&#39;s not very practical for getting to and from work.  No, the computer we dream about having on our desk is usually something a little bit faster, a little bit sleeker and just a little bit more expensive than what we can actually afford. If you&#39;re a dedicated games player, there&#39;s always the next graphics card, that extra gig of RAM, those extra few frames per second you can chase - but that&#39;s still the realistic dreaming, it&#39;s something within reach; perhaps not quite in line with a sensible Ford, but not as far out there as an APC.  And, even if you are currently dreaming of the home computer equivalent of an APC (let&#39;s pretend that&#39;s a top of the line Mac Pro, just for the sake of argument), getting one won&#39;t make much of a difference in day to day use. Sure, the machine might be faster than your current one, but except for the rare few cases when you actually utilize all that power, it won&#39;t provide a profoundly different user experience compared to what an iMac will deliver at a fraction of the cost. It&#39;s the same OS, the same applications and the same basic architecture. This is true for Windows and Linux machines as well: you can add more RAM and disk and CPU cores, but the machine won&#39;t behave in a significantly different way from what you&#39;re used to.  Now, when I was a kid... computers were cool.  In 1994, I bought a second hand Amiga 1200 with a 120 megabyte hard drive. It was a low cost, capable home computer with good sound and graphics. It was more than enough for the kind of gaming and school work a kid my age wanted to do, but the 14 MHz processor was a tad slow when it came to heavy lifting. Applying just a hint of Gaussian blur to a very low resolution JPEG file took ages. Dabbling in animation, I frequently hit the barrier of the 2 megs of RAM it came with. However, it also had a motherboard connector for adding more memory and a faster CPU. This was the reasonable dream: it was within my reach, it was the sensible family Ford.  Thus, in 1995, I got a CPU and RAM upgrade for it, making it roughly four times faster. In those days, that was a pretty hefty upgrade: speeding up from 10 to 40 MPH is more noticeable to a human compared to the difference between the 10000 and 40000 MPH speeds of today&#39;s machines. But the speed-up didn&#39;t profoundly change my user experience. I was still shuffling about with the same old software and I was still waiting around for that Gaussian blur calculation to finish - although not quite as many minutes as before.  As I sat there, watching the Gaussian blur progress bar, I of course dreamt of the computing equivalent of an Armoured Personnel Carrier. It wasn&#39;t an Amiga 4000 or a Pentium PC or one of those new-fangled PowerMacs. It was something completely different, something that would have utterly changed my all-round user experience, from boot-up to shutdown. I wanted something the likes of which actually no longer exists: I dreamt of a Unix Workstation.  Not just any old Unix box mind you, but a rather specific one: a Silicon Graphics Indy with a 24-bit frame buffer, 128 megabytes of memory and a 175 MHz MIPS R4400 CPU.  It was, hands down, just about the most maxed-out piece of hardware that could grace the top of a desk. Design-wise, computers have always been kind of beige - literally and figuratively. Black computers became commonplace some time around, say, 2000, but that was hardly a giant leap in design. Depending on your tastes, you might think companies like Apple or Alienware produce attractive machines - but then again, perhaps you&#39;ve never seen an SGI Indy.  The teal blue pizza box case sports a horizontal, slightly diagonally skewed cut along the middle, shifting the top and bottom parts in a slight offset. The monitor was huge for its time: a 17&#34; CRT cased in grey granite plastic, matching the mouse and keyboard. Both the computer and the screen were adorned with embossed SGI cube logos in a gleaming silver finish. It was over the top, maximalist 1990s more-is-more design in a strangely tasteful package and a far cry from the sleek, subdued designer machines of today. Yet, it wasn&#39;t an overstatement - it might&#39;ve talked the talk, but it sure as hell could walk the walk.  For example, it didn&#39;t even have a regular floppy drive - it had a bizarre floptical unit capable of storing 20 megabytes on a single, magneto-optical disk. On top of the giant screen a webcam was poised, surely one of the absolutely first computers to come with such a device as standard. In fact, it was called an IndyCam - the term webcam hadn&#39;t really caught on yet and was more commonly used to describe just about any camera that regularly uploaded a still image to a public web server.  And that, of course, are all trivial oddities compared to the guts of the machine. Even though it was an entry-level workstation, SGI&#39;s custom hardware was capable of churning out both 2D and 3D graphics unmatched by any contemporaneous gaming PC, however expensive, and the CPU could run in circles around even the most outrageously-priced Pentium home computer available at the time.  And then there was the operating system. And the software.  IRIX, SGI&#39;s in-house Unix flavour, came with their own proprietary GUI and desktop. It was called Indigo Magic and, featuring things like scalable vector icons, animated desktop backgrounds and visual feedback cues, it was just about as outlandish as the name suggests. It should be noted that this was ten years before any PC owner had gotten the chance to grow tired of such pointless flash and that for the serious hacker, there was always a terminal emulator with a capable shell on hand.  Apart from all the usual Unix-related niceties such as stability, pre-emptive multitasking, multi-user support, excellent command line utilities and a bunch of readily available programming languages, it had an impressive array of professional productivity software. Most of it was not available on my home computer, and even if it was, the Indy could run it both faster and in higher resolution. Apart from industry standards such as Photoshop and Netscape, there was a world of curious and wonderful applications written with nothing but SGI hardware in mind: web authoring, video editing, image manipulation and graphics creation unavailable on any other platform. It was a true digital media production workhorse, an overgrown distant cousin to the machines available on the then budding multimedia PC market.  In short, it was a cool computer. Far too expensive for any home user, of course. But so. Damn. Cool.  There are computers aimed at this kind of work today as well. One of the high-end Macs mentioned before, for example, or perhaps a suitably high-powered Windows machine. In fact, pretty much any dirt cheap home computer will, pixel for pixel, do what the Indy did - except faster, cheaper and in many cases better.  Yet there isn&#39;t, today, an equivalent of the SGI Indy, or the Sun SPARCstation, or the DEC Alpha, or any of the other professional workstations. The only thing that&#39;s on offer is more of the same user experience, only slightly faster.  That&#39;s why computers are so boring these days. Because even though IRIX, Indigo Magic and the Indy by no means was a perfect solution to all of my computational desires back then, it had the lure of the unknown and unattainable: it was a goal to strive for, a source of inspiration and aspiration and a promise that better things were possible.  Today, we all know about the different quirks, mannerisms, privacy issues, drawbacks and occasional benefits of Windows update loops, overpriced Mac hardware and the tiresome fiddliness of Linux. Those are the choices we have and they&#39;re not going to change any time soon.  I&#39;d somehow be more okay with all of this if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that, to top it all off, we have no other platform left to dream of.  That&#39;s just not cool.</p><p>当我还是个孩子的时候，电脑很酷。现在？没那么多。我知道，我知道。脾气暴躁的老家伙一毛钱一打，他们对过去的看法往往被幸福的健忘和怀旧的金色阴霾所过滤。当然，对我来说也是如此，但我仍然认为这一点是有道理的：计算机过去比现在酷得多--比现在酷了几个数量级。或许可以用一个类比来解释这种情况：你有一辆生锈的1994年的菲亚特庞托(Fiat Pinto)，你迫切需要投资一辆新车。当然，你可以有远大的梦想--也许你想要一辆装甲运兵车，也许是一辆马力十足、拉皮条的特斯拉(Tesla)，配上所有的铃铛和口哨，或者为什么不想要一辆法拉利(Ferrari)呢？然而，现实地说，你可能正在考虑一辆全新的福特汽车：一款明智的家用汽车，仍将是你目前驾驶的那辆破旧汽车的升级版。而且，一旦你积累了足够的资金，那很可能就是你要买的东西。不过，那个APC..。伙计，开一辆这样的车该多甜蜜啊？只是在早上的交通中雷鸣般的通过，拳头在空中挥舞，对那个开着SUV的家伙大喊大叫，这个家伙总是在杂货店的十字路口超车，冲到你前面。现在可不是那么自鸣得意了，嗯，运动公用事业先生？这就是电脑过去的样子。别误会我的意思。如果你愿意，你可以花几乎无限的钱买一台电脑--它一直都是这样的，而且很可能在可预见的将来也是这样。对于用于科学的超级计算机集群和维持银行和股票市场运转的大型机来说，情况尤其如此。但是，当我们梦想着计算机的能力时，很少有人能想象有机会接触到这样的庞然大物。除非我们在业余时间涉足计算生物学，否则我们用机器做的事情只能快到一定程度。这就像用一艘航空母舰取代我们虚弱的菲亚特一样：当然，它是强大的，但它上下班不太实用。不，我们梦寐以求的办公桌上的电脑通常比我们实际买得起的要快一点，时尚一点，贵一点。如果你是一名专心玩游戏的人，总会有下一块显卡、额外的内存，以及你可以追逐的额外每秒几帧--但这仍然是现实的梦想，它是触手可及的；或许不太像一辆明智的福特，但也没有APC那么远。而且，即使你目前梦想拥有一台相当于APC的家用电脑(让我们假装自己是最好的Mac Pro，只是为了争辩)，买一台也不会对日常使用有太大影响。当然，这台机器可能会比你现在的机器更快，但除了极少数情况下你真正利用了所有的电力外，它不会提供与iMac相比完全不同的用户体验，成本只有iMac的一小部分。它是相同的操作系统、相同的应用程序和相同的基本架构。对于Windows和Linux计算机也是如此：您可以添加更多的RAM、磁盘和CPU核心，但是计算机的行为方式与您习惯的方式不会有明显的不同。现在，当我还是个孩子的时候。电脑很酷。1994年，我买了一台带120兆硬盘的二手Amiga1200。这是一台低成本、功能强大的家用电脑，声音和图形效果都很好。对于我这个年龄的孩子想做的游戏和学校作业来说，这已经绰绰有余了，但14 MHz的处理器在搬运重物时有点慢。对分辨率非常低的JPEG文件仅应用一丝高斯模糊需要花费很长时间。在涉足动画的过程中，我经常遇到它附带的2兆RAM的障碍。然而，它也有一个主板接口，可以增加更多的内存和更快的CPU。这就是合情合理的梦想：这是我触手可及的，这是明智的福特家族。因此，在1995年，我对它进行了CPU和RAM升级，使其速度提高了大约4倍。在那些日子里，这是一次相当大的升级：与今天机器时速10000英里和40000英里之间的差异相比，人类更容易注意到从每小时10英里到40英里的加速。但是加速并没有深刻地改变我的用户体验。我仍然在拖着同样的旧软件走来走去，我仍然在等待高斯模糊计算完成-尽管没有以前那么长的时间。当我坐在那里，看着高斯模糊进度条时，我当然梦见了一辆装甲运兵车的计算等价物。它不是Amiga4000，也不是奔腾PC，也不是那些新奇的PowerMac。这是完全不同的东西，完全改变了我从启动到关机的全方位用户体验。我.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://datagubbe.se/coolcomp.html">https://datagubbe.se/coolcomp.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/计算机/">#计算机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/computers/">#computers</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
