Since her novel  Water for Elephants sold 10 million copies worldwide and inspired a movie starring Reese Witherspoon, Sara Gruen has received 60 or so letters from people behind bars, but this one was different. The sender’s name was Charles Murdoch, prisoner No. C76287, sentenced to life without parole for first-degree murder. “I just finished devouring your WATER FOR ELEPHANTS,” he wrote. “Oh man … it was AWESOME!” The 2006 book, a tale of star-crossed lovers in a traveling circus, was personal for Murdoch. When he was a kid, he wrote, his grandpa told tales of performing in an early-20th-century circus with his teenage bride, Lottie. Murdoch wondered if Sara had based one of her characters, Lottie the Aerialist, on his grandmother; if so, his “long departed grandfolks would have sure been tickled and honored.” He signed off “Respectfully, Chuck Murdoch” and added a strange moniker: “Badfish.”</p><p>它开始了来自加利福尼亚州愉快的山谷州监狱的一封信。由于她为大象的新型水销售了1000万份副本，并激发了一部马塞斯塞斯隆的电影，Sara Gruen从酒吧后面的人们收到了60左右的信件，但这一个不同。发件人的名字是Charles Murdoch，囚犯No.C76287，判处没有假释的生活，以获得一级谋杀。 “我刚刚为大象吞噬了你的水，”他写道。 “哦，人......这太棒了！” 2006年的书籍是一个旅行马戏团的星际恋人的故事，是默多克的个人。他写的时候，他写道，他的爷爷在20世纪的海峡乐蒂·卢蒂耶告诉20世纪初的马戏团的故事。 Murdoch想知道Sara是否以她的祖母为基础的一个人物，Lottie兰迪师;如果是这样，他的“长期离去的祖母肯定会被诞生和荣幸。”他签了“恭敬地，查克默多克”，并添加了一个奇怪的绰号：“Badfish”。</p><p>  The letter came from Gruen’s publisher in June 2015, which had forwarded it to her home in Asheville, North Carolina, where she lives with her husband, her son (the youngest of her three adult children), and a menagerie of pets, including horses named Tia and Fancy. Even aside from the remarkable connection to her book — Sara, 52, had indeed researched a real-life performer named Lottie — Murdoch’s letter stood out. He had created his own stationery, decorating his letter with intricate doodles: two flowers, a tiny heart, a spiky fish with neon stripes. He wrote that former chief justice Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit “described my (wrongful) conviction as ‘a truly spectacular miscarriage of justice.’”</p><p>  这封信于2015年6月来自Gruen的出版商，这已经将其转发给她在北卡罗来纳州阿什维尔的家中，她和她的丈夫住在一起，她的儿子（她的三个成年儿童中最年轻）以及宠物的动物园，包括马命名为tia和pastancy。即使除了与她的书的卓越联系之外 - 萨拉，52，确实研究了一个名为Lottie的真实表演者 - 默多克的信突出了。他创造了自己的文具，用复杂的涂鸦装饰他的信：两朵花，一颗小心，一条带有霓虹条纹的尖刺鱼。他写道，前首席大法官Alex Kozinski对第九回路的上诉法院“描述了我的（错误的）被定罪作为”真正壮观的司法诉讼“。</p><p> Most surprising to Sara: Murdoch did not ask for money or help or even a response. Since publishing her book, she’d experienced a surge of readers and fans reaching out, seemingly interested in how her celebrity might benefit them. Some instances were so outrageous I might think Sara was exaggerating had I not witnessed them myself.</p><p> 萨拉最令人惊讶的是：默多克没有要求金钱或帮助甚至回应。自从发布她的书以来，她经历了读者和粉丝的激增，似乎对她的名人如何使他们有益。有些情况是如此令人发指，我可能认为萨拉夸大了，我没有见证他们自己。</p><p> One reader wrote to her, musing about how easy it would be to attend an event and shoot her. Another reader, with whom Sara corresponded often on Facebook, eventually became so obsessed with her that she had to block him; a year to the day later, he died by suicide. Once, a woman in her neighborhood banged on Sara’s door for help, saying that her dog had fallen down a steep hole nearby. The woman didn’t seem to know who the author was, which she found comforting, and they became casual friends. Two months later, the woman revealed that she had known who Sara was all along and wanted access to her publishing contacts. Suspecting that the woman had gone so far as to purposely drop her dog down that hole, Sara enlisted her husband, Bob, to intervene. “Sara has been approached so many times by people wanting something from her,” he wrote to the woman, “that she has trouble trusting that those who befriend her really just want to be her friend. Too often her suspicions are warranted — and some of the people involved have actually been dangerous. Unfortunately, you now fall into the category of those who contribute to her worry about whom she can let into her life.” Such bizarre encounters affected Sara so deeply that our mutual friend nicknamed her “Sara Suspicious.”</p><p> 一位读者写信给她，纪念参加活动并射击她的容易。另一个读者，萨拉经常在Facebook上致电，最终变得如此痴迷，她不得不阻止他;一年到一天后，他被自杀死亡。曾经，她的邻居的一个女人敲了萨拉的门，以帮助她的狗落在附近的陡峭洞中。女人似乎没有知道作者是谁，她发现安慰，他们成为随意的朋友。两个月后，该女士透露，她已知萨拉一直都是谁，并希望获得她的出版联系人。怀疑这位女士在故意落下了那个洞，萨拉赢了她的丈夫，鲍勃，干预。 “萨拉已经被想要一些东西从她那里得到了这么多次，”他写信给女人，“她有不信任那些与她交朋友的人真正想要成为她的朋友。她的怀疑经常是有保证的 - 其中一些参与者实际上是危险的。不幸的是，你现在属于那些为她担心她能进入她的生活的人的类别。“这种奇怪的遭遇影响了萨拉，深深地，我们的共同朋友绰号绰号了她的“萨拉怀疑”。</p><p> Still, Murdoch’s letter piqued Sara’s curiosity. She spent the next hour Googling Murdoch’s case — and the next hour, and the next. She had been in the midst of researching her next novel, featuring a cast of characters whose fates collide on the Orient Express, but her outline, arranged along her walls in a sprawling web of Post-its, suddenly seemed trivial in comparison to Murdoch’s case.</p><p> 仍然，默多克的信激起了萨拉的好奇心。她花了下一小时谷歌岭默多克的案例 - 下一小时，下一个小时，下一步。她一直在研究她的下一部小说中，采用了一个字符的演员，其命运在东方表达上碰撞，但她的轮廓，沿着她的墙壁排列在庞大的帖子中，突然似乎与默多克的案例相比似乎微不足道。</p><p> Each new page about Murdoch’s twisted legal saga contained a revelation more outrageous than the last. As Sara saw it, the investigation hinged on a coerced confession, and the trial, she concluded, was marred by mercurial witnesses, the suppression of crucial evidence, and a judge who seemed motivated to secure Murdoch’s conviction. Kozinski’s idiosyncratic dissent in Murdoch’s appeal stayed with her:</p><p> 关于默多克扭曲的法律佐贺的每个新页面都有比上一个更加令人发指的启示。随着萨拉看到它，她在被胁迫的忏悔和审判中讨论的调查是由梅尔梅利证人的造成的，抑制关键证据，以及似乎有动力以保护默多克信念的法官。 Kozinski在Murdoch的呼吁中的特殊异步留在她身边：</p><p> “If it wasn’t for bad luck, Murdoch wouldn’t have no luck at all. He’s wakin’ up this mornin’ in jail when there’s strong proof he ain’t done nothing wrong. I would certainly defer to a jury’s contrary verdict if it had seen this evidence and convicted Murdoch after a fair trial, presided over by a fair judge, followed by an appeal where the justices considered all of his constitutional claims. But Murdoch had none of these.”</p><p> “如果不是运气不好，默多克根本不会有运气。当有强有力的证据时，他在监狱里在监狱里，他没有做错任何问题。如果在公平的审判之后，我肯定会推迟陪审团相反的判决，并在公平的审判之后被定罪，由公平法官主持，随后是一项诉诸所有宪法索赔的诉求。但默多克没有这些。“ </p><p> Sara uncharacteristically wrote Murdoch back. Her package contained signed copies of all of her books and a note: “May justice finally prevail.” After sending it, she immediately regretted her response. “Justice is not going to fucking prevail finally on its own,” she thought, “and that was a really asinine thing to write to a guy who’s doing life.”</p><p>萨拉无论如何写下默多克背部。她的包裹包含了她所有书籍的签名副本和一个注释：“愿正义终于占上风。”发送后，她立即后悔了她的回应。 “正义不是为了他妈的终于自己，”她想，“这是一个真正的asinine，给一个正在做生活的人。”</p><p> She didn’t yet know that Murdoch’s letter was to change her own life. It also nearly ruined it. She is now, in her words, “absolutely broke,” “seriously ill,” and her current work in progress is “years past deadline.” Since 2016, she has been in a perpetual state of emergency. She has borrowed against her house. Death threats forced her to flee her home for months. Her health declined mysteriously and with terrifying speed. As Sara’s friend of nearly 20 years, I worried that she might die — or that if she lived, it would be as an incomplete, foreign version of herself, one incapable of coherent conversation, let alone writing books.</p><p> 她还没有知道默多克的信是改变自己的生活。它也几乎毁了它。她现在，在她的话说，“绝对破产了，”“严重生病”，而她目前正在进行的工作是“过去截止日期”。自2016年以来，她一直处于紧急情况的永恒状态。她借了她的房子。死亡威胁迫使她逃离她的家几个月。她的健康神秘地拒绝了恐吓速度。作为萨拉的朋友近20年，我担心她可能会死 - 或者如果她活着，那将是一个不完整的外国版，一个无法连贯的谈话，更不用说写书。</p><p> As a journalist, I watched, increasingly confounded, as her casual investigation of an old murder case bloomed into a frenzied obsession. Six years on, I tried to make sense of the chaos that subsumed Sara’s existence.</p><p> 作为一名记者，我看着，越来越多地混淆，因为她随便调查了盛开的旧谋杀案中疯狂的痴迷。六年来，我试图了解召开萨拉的存在的混乱。</p><p>    In the days following their initial correspondence, Sara began her own investigation of the murder case and Murdoch’s long criminal history. He was not the “fuzzy bunny of wrongfully convicted inmates,” she acknowledged. His rap sheet spanned six pages. In Long Beach, California, during the ’80s, he became known as the “Baskin-Robbins Bandit” for holding up ice-cream stores, although he insisted that his .38-caliber revolver was never loaded. He picked locations that had high school students for clerks because they were less likely to create a problem. Before leaving, he always asked for a cone to go.</p><p>    在他们初次通讯后的日子里，Sara开始调查谋杀案和默多克的长期犯罪历史。她不是“错误被错误定罪的囚犯的模糊兔子”，“她承认。他的说唱板界六页。在加利福尼亚州的长滩，在80年代，他被称为“Baskin-Robbins Bandit”，用于举起冰淇淋店，虽然他坚持他的.38-Calibre左轮手枪从未装过。他选择了有高中生职员的地点，因为它们不太可能创造一个问题。在离开之前，他总是要求锥体去。</p><p> Then came the case that would lead to Murdoch’s murder conviction. On May 17, 1983, three men robbed Chris’s Horseshoe Bar in Long Beach. A patron was fatally shot, and another stabbed and critically wounded. One of the thieves left a fingerprint on the cash register, and more than a decade later, with advances in forensic science, police were able to trace it to a man named Dino Dinardo.</p><p> 然后是将导致默多克的谋杀定罪的案例。 1983年5月17日，三名男子在长滩抢劫了克里斯的马蹄铁酒吧。赞助人在致命的射击，另一个刺伤和严重受伤。其中一个盗贼在收银机上留下了指纹，并且在前几十年之后，法医学的进步，警方能够将其追溯到一个名叫迪诺迪卡多的人。</p><p> Homicide detective Ronald Pavek arrested him in Berkeley in June 1994. At first Dinardo denied being involved with the crime, but he recanted when presented with the fingerprint evidence. Then, according to Dinardo’s testimony at a later hearing, Pavek said that he was “interested in someone other than you” and that if Dinardo “helped them out,” things “would be all right.” Pavek later testified that he “just happened to have photographs with me of Mr. Murdoch,” which he showed to Dinardo. When Dinardo failed to come up with Murdoch’s surname, Pavek flipped the photo over so Dinardo could read it. Dinardo named Murdoch as an accomplice.</p><p> 凶杀案侦探罗纳德·潘克克于1994年6月在伯克利逮捕了他。在第一个迪纳德多被拒绝参与犯罪，但他在指纹证据呈现时发出。然后，根据Dinardo的证词在后来的听证会上，Pavek表示，他“对你以外的人感兴趣”，如果Dinardo“帮助他们，”事情“将是正确的。” Pavek后来证明他“刚刚与Murdoch先生有照片，”他向Dinardo展示了。当Dinardo未能拿出默多克的姓氏时，Pavek将照片翻过来，所以Dinardo可以阅读它。 Dinardo命名为默多克作为一个帮凶。</p><p> Both Dinardo and Murdoch were charged with murder and tried separately; Dinardo was first. At a hearing before his trial, Dinardo testified that the police coerced him to implicate Murdoch in the crime. He was convicted and sentenced to 25 years to life. Although judges don’t typically bargain with either the defense or prosecution teams, Judge Charles Sheldon made an unusual offer during Dinardo’s sentencing: “I have 90 days to change the sentence if anything changes in the way of your mind.” Sheldon added that Murdoch’s prosecutors had “a very difficult case” without Dinardo’s assistance and that he would be inclined to reduce the sentence should Dinardo testify against his alleged accomplice.</p><p> Dinardo和Murdoch都被指控谋杀并单独尝试; Dinardo是第一个。在他的审判前听证会，Dinardo作证，警方强迫他致力于犯罪的默多克。他被定罪并被判处25岁。虽然法官通常不讨价还价，但谢尔斯·谢尔顿法官在Dinardo的判决中发出了一个不寻常的报价：“如果任何事情都以你的想法变化，我有90天的判决。”谢尔顿补充说，默多克的检察官没有Dinardo的援助，默登的检察官“是一个非常困难的案例”，他将倾向于减少判决，因为Dinardo对他所谓的同罪作证。 </p><p>    Dinardo agreed, but before the trial began, he sent a letter to his then-attorney, reiterating that Pavek had coerced a statement from him and had promised not to charge him with murder if he implicated Murdoch. In the letter (which was sealed under attorney-client privilege but was paraphrased by a judge who had seen it), Dinardo said, “I do not actually know Mr. Murdoch, although I know his brother. Mr. Murdoch and I did not commit any crime.”</p><p>Dinardo同意，但在审判开始之前，他寄给了他的那封信，重申Pavek从他那里强迫了一份声明，并承诺如果他暗示默多克，就答应没有谋杀罪。在信中（在律师的特权下被封锁，但被一审曾看到它的法官），Dinardo说：“我实际上并不知道默多克先生，虽然我认识他的兄弟。默多克先生，我没有犯罪。“</p><p> Dinardo went on to become the prosecution’s key witness. But the jury never learned of the letter’s existence. Murdoch, accused of firing the fatal shot, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole. Meanwhile, Dinardo’s sentence was reduced to 12 years for voluntary manslaughter, and he ended up serving about five.</p><p> Dinardo继续成为检察机关的关键见证。但陪审团从未了解过这封信的存在。默多克被指控射击致命射击，被判犯有一级谋杀罪并被判处没有假释的生活。与此同时，Dinardo的判决减少到志愿杀人杀戮的12年，他最终提供了大约五个。</p><p> By the time Sara received Murdoch’s letter, the California Court of Appeal had upheld Murdoch’s conviction, the state’s Supreme Court had denied his petition for review, and a federal petition to the district court was dismissed. Every prisoner who’d written to Sara claimed innocence, but Murdoch is the only one she came to believe. In her view, the only relevant point about Murdoch’s rap sheet was that he’d pleaded guilty to every crime he’d been accused of — except for the murder charge, which she considered further proof of his innocence. Her husband agreed. “I thought, ‘This is really terrible,’” Bob says today. “We naively thought that with Sara having a public image, we could just push it and tell people about it and someone would clear it up. But it became obvious that that wasn’t true.”</p><p> 当萨拉收到默多克的信时，加州上诉法院已经追求默多克的信念，州最高法院否认了他的审查请愿，并将联邦法院申请被驳回。每个囚犯那些写信给萨拉声称无罪，但默多克是她唯一一个相信的人。在她看来，关于默多克的说唱表的唯一有关点是他向他被指责的每一项罪行都恳求诉讼 - 除了谋杀罪，她认为她的清白的进一步证明。她的丈夫同意了。 “我想，”这真的很可怕，“鲍勃今天说。 “我们天真地认为，与萨拉有一个公共形象，我们可以推动它并告诉别人，有人会清除它。但这显然是不是真的。“</p><p>  Sara and Murdoch quickly became close, corresponding about much more than just his legal woes. Murdoch told her that he, too, was a parent, a father of two girls — one of whom he’d never even hugged because she’d been born after his imprisonment. He’d grown up in the U.S. Army Housing Projects on the edge of Long Beach, close to Compton, and claimed that when he was young, his mother told him that she “should have pinched your head off and flushed it down the toilet” instead of giving birth to him. After his father was run over and killed by an 18-wheeler, his head completely crushed, 16-year-old Murdoch had to identify the body. His older stepbrother hung with a rough crowd, including Dino Dinardo.</p><p>  萨拉和默多克很快就变得很近，相当不仅仅是他的法律困境。默多克告诉她，他也是一个父母，两个女孩的父亲 - 其中一个人，他甚至没有拥抱，因为她被监禁后出生。他在长滩边缘的美国陆军房项目中长大，靠近康普顿，声称当他年轻时，他的母亲告诉他，她“应该把你的头捏住，用厕所冲下来”而不是生育他。在他的父亲被一个18载者碾过并被一个18载者杀死之后，他的头完全被粉碎，16岁的默多克必须识别身体。他的较旧的继兄弟挂着粗糙的人群，包括Dino Dinardo。</p><p> When Murdoch began doing drugs and stealing, his mother sent him to a facility for juvenile delinquents where he said he was frequently attacked. Sara, normally very reluctant to speak about her past, confided the darker parts of her own history. She spoke of being left to fend for herself at age 15, a “street urchin” who scrambled to survive.</p><p> 当默多克开始做毒品和偷窃时，他的母亲将他送到了一个少年违法的设施，他说他经常被攻击。萨拉，通常非常不愿意谈论她的过去，将自己历史的较暗部分呈现。她谈到15岁以上的“街道核心”争夺了追捕才能生存。</p><p> Murdoch sent poems, greeting cards, and detailed accounts of prison life. His signoff, “Badfish,” was often accompanied by a watercolor portrait of a surfer, Murdoch’s alter ego, free to ride the waves and feel the heat of the sun. In turn, she sent news of her sons, her novel research, her animals, and her friends. They shared triumphs and frustrations, secrets large and small. “Of course he fell in love with her,” Bob says of Murdoch. “I wasn’t bothered by it. I knew she wasn’t attracted to him. I know people want to make her into one of those women who, for whatever reason, fall in love with men in jail.”</p><p> 默多克派出了诗歌，贺卡和监狱生活的详细叙述。他的签收，“Badfish，”常常伴随着冲浪者的水彩肖像，默多克的改变自我，自由骑海浪，感受太阳的热量。反过来，她派了她的儿子的消息，她的小说研究，她的动物和她的朋友。他们分享了胜利，挫折，秘密大而小。 “当然，他爱上了她，”鲍勃说默多克说。 “我没有被它困扰。我知道她没有被他吸引。我知道人们希望她成为其中一个女人，无论是什么原因，都爱上了监狱的男人。“</p><p> Sara and Bob believed they were Murdoch’s best and final hope. In October 2015, four months after receiving Murdoch’s first letter, Sara hired Jeffrey Hammerschmidt, a criminal defense attorney in Fresno. His tasks were twofold: Find new information about the 1983 murder that might prove Murdoch’s innocence, and defend him against a different, current charge for “possession of deadly weapon.” In letters to Sara, Murdoch explained the incident: A year earlier, he and another prisoner were talking in the prison common room when there was a commotion; a prisoner had been stabbed. Murdoch told Sara that he’d been standing in the wrong spot at the wrong time and was charged with possession of three shanks that the guards had found nearby.</p><p> 萨拉和鲍勃认为，他们是默多克的最佳希望。 2015年10月，收到默多克第一封信后四个月，萨拉聘请了Fresno的刑事辩护律师杰弗里·哈默克米德。他的任务是双重的：找到有关1983年谋杀案的新信息，可能证明默多克的纯真，并捍卫他的违法行为“拥有致命武器”。在给Sara的信中，默多克解释了这一事件：一年同期，他和另一个囚犯在监狱普通房间谈话时;囚犯被刺伤了。默多克告诉萨拉，他在错误的时间站在错误的地方，被指控拥有卫兵在附近找到的三个小腿。 </p><p> The charge struck Sara as suspicious. Fifty-seven years old at the time of the incident, Murdoch wore a knee brace and walked with a cane. She trusted him enough to arrange and pay for an MRI of his knee to be used as evidence should the case go to court. But she hoped such a precaution would ultimately be unnecessary; if Hammerschmidt could get the prosecutor to dismiss the charges, they could then focus on the bigger picture. He estimated that this would cost her $78,000, and Sara believed it was possible that Murdoch would be free by Easter 2016.</p><p>充电击打萨拉和可疑。发生事件时五十七岁，默多克戴着膝盖支撑并带着拐杖走路。她信任他足以安排和支付他的膝盖MRI，因为案件去法院应该被用作证据。但她希望如此预防措施最终是不必要的;如果Hammerschmidt可以让检察官解雇指控，然后他们可以专注于更大的画面。他估计，这将花费78,000美元，萨拉认为默多克2016年复活节将是免费的。</p><p> Sara wrote an initial $7,500 retainer check and agreed to pay $20,000 per month while also continuing to investigate on her own. She transformed her “lair,” as she calls her office, into a legal war room, piling boxes of paperwork by her favorite chaise lounge, hoping to unearth anything in 10,000 pages of transcripts and records that might secure Murdoch’s release.</p><p> 萨拉写了一份最初的7,500美元保留支票，并同意每月支付20,000美元，同时也继续进行自己调查。她改变了她的“巢穴”，因为她叫她的办公室，进入一个法律战争室，由她最喜欢的躺椅堆积的文书工作，希望能够在10,000页的成绩单和记录中解除任何可能保护默多克释放的记录。</p><p> Each finding enraged her. No physical evidence linked Murdoch to the shooting. The bar&#39;s stabbing victim, who had testified against Murdoch, admitted to being so drunk that he couldn’t even recall being attacked, and he was not shown any pictures of possible suspects in the immediate aftermath. Dyanne Spence, a bartender at Chris’s Horseshoe Bar who was considered a key witness in the original murder case, had been shown a photo of Murdoch immediately following the robbery and didn’t recognize him. Twelve years later, however, she pointed confidently to Murdoch from the witness stand. As Kozinski concluded, “There was no way the prosecution could have gotten a conviction without a miracle called Dinardo.”</p><p> 每次发现引起她。没有物理证据将默多克联系在射击中。酒吧＆＃39; S刺伤的受害者，他对默多克作证的，承认醉酒，甚至难以回忆遭到攻击，他没有在后期后发现可能嫌疑人的任何可能的嫌疑人。 Dyanne Spence，克里斯的马蹄铁酒吧的调酒师被认为是原来谋杀案中的一个关键见证，已经被抢劫后立即显示了默多克的照片，并没有认出他。然而，十二年后，她自信地向默多克从证人的立场指出。正如Kozinski所结束的那样，“如果没有奇迹的奇迹，则无法让起诉的定罪。”</p><p>    Sara visited Murdoch for the first time on November 2, 2015. “I saw hope bloom across his face, and it was honestly one of the most poignant moments of my life,” she emailed me afterward. “Right up there with seeing my babies for the first time.” She tried to prepare him for the difficulties he might encounter should he finally be freed. “When you finally do let your guard down,” she wrote to him, “and learn to trust (but only those who are trustworthy — I hope you’ll let me help vet people at first) I think the enormity of what you’ve been through will hit you, and it may feel like more than you can manage … The universe has been hurtling us toward each other our whole lives.”</p><p>    萨拉于2015年11月2日第一次访问默多克。“我看到了他的脸上的希望绽放，老实说，这是我生命中最令人痛苦的时刻之一，”她以后通过电子邮件给我发了电子邮件。 “在那里第一次看到我的婴儿。”她试图为他做好准备，因为他终于难以释放他可能会遇到的困难。 “当你终于做到了让你的守卫，”她写信给他，“并学会信任（但只有那些值得信赖的人 - 我希望你能让我先帮助我的兽医）我认为你的巨大经历过来会击中你，可能觉得比你能管理更多......宇宙一直在互相碰撞我们的整个生活。“</p><p> But spring 2016 was fast approaching and Murdoch was seemingly no closer to being released. Sara also hadn’t worked on her Orient Express novel in nine months. In touch with her on a daily basis, I began to worry about Sara’s growing fixation on the case, her willingness to put her life on hold in the hope of saving Murdoch’s. Other longtime friends and I pleaded with her to focus on her novel, even if she continued to finance the legal battle. Desperate, Sara recorded a 95-second  video explaining Murdoch’s case and sent it to Dr. Phil. “If ever there was a situation that was broken and needed fixing,” she concluded, holding back tears, “it’s this. Please, Dr. Phil, help.”</p><p> 但2016年春季快速接近，默多克似乎没有更接近被释放。萨拉也没有在9个月内在她东方表达小说上工作。与她每天都与她联系，我开始担心萨拉对案件的越来越多的修复，她愿意将她的生命置于拯救默多克的希望。其他长期朋友，我恳求她专注于她的小说，即使她继续融资法律战斗。绝望，萨拉记录了一个95秒的视频解释默多克的案例并将其发送给菲尔博士。 “如果有一个破坏和需要定影的情况，”她得出结论，抱着眼泪，“这就是这样。请菲尔博士，帮助。“</p><p> Dr. Phil’s producer called. Her first question, as Sara recalls it: Was Sara in love with Murdoch? Why him, of all wrongfully convicted prisoners? She had been expecting this question. “Because he’s a goddamned human being,” she fumed. “That is categorically not the case, and I will take it very badly indeed if someone tries to frame it in that light.” I believed her. For Sara — highly competitive, monumentally stubborn, and singularly obsessive in pursuit of her goals — the battle to save Murdoch had nothing to do with a love affair; it was a  challenge. She would take on the system, find new exculpatory evidence, and win.</p><p> 菲尔的生产者博士叫。她的第一个问题，正如萨拉回忆起：萨拉爱上了默多克？为什么他，所有错误被定罪的囚犯？她一直在期待这个问题。 “因为他是一个致命的人类，”她发胖。 “这是一个没有这种情况，如果有人试图在那种光线中框架，我将非常糟糕。”我相信她。对于萨拉 - 竞争，唯一的顽固，追求她的目标，拯救默多克的战斗与爱情无关;这是一项挑战。她会接受系统，找到新的吞噬证据，并获胜。</p><p> In the meantime, she was frustrated with her lawyer’s apparent lack of progress, especially considering his fee had far exceeded the original estimate of $78,000. She believed Hammerschmidt hadn’t read the volumes of files she’d sent and was slow to respond to emails. (To me, Hammerschmidt responded: “Of course I read the files. I would estimate that I responded to more than 500 of Ms. Gruen’s emails, during the day, at night, and on weekends, often receiving and responding to multiple emails from her per day. Having spent considerable time on this case, I strongly believe Mr. Murdoch was wrongfully convicted of murder.”) After Easter had come and gone, Sara fired Hammerschmidt and hired a new team.</p><p> 与此同时，她对她的律师明显缺乏进步感到沮丧，特别是考虑到他的费用远远超过了78,000美元的原始估计。她相信哈塞奇米德没有阅读她发送的文件的卷，并慢慢回复电子邮件。 （对我来说，Hammerschmidt回答说：“当然，我读了这些文件。我估计我在白天，晚上和周末，经常收到和回复多个电子邮件，我估计了超过500个Gruen的电子邮件。她的每天。在这种情况下度过了大量的时间，我强烈地相信默多克先生被错误地被判犯有谋杀罪。“）在复活节过来之后，萨拉解雇了Hamperchmidt并聘请了一支新的团队。 </p><p> They seemed a perfect fit for Murdoch’s case: Robin Sax was a former prosecutor in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office. Steven Graff Levine previously worked for the California Supreme Court and had worked on high-profile cases involving Paris Hilton, Phil Spector, and Michael Jackson. And Luis Bolaños, a private investigator, boasted a litany of surveillance and counterterrorism specialties. Sara agreed again to a budget of $20,000 per month. Levine considered the question of Murdoch’s guilt or innocence to be irrelevant. “Chuck was stitched up,” he told me. “Enough for me. Did he do it? I really don’t know and don’t care because he should be out.”</p><p>他们似乎是默多克的案例的完美契合：Robin Sax是洛杉矶区律师办公室的前检察官。 Steven Graff Levine以前为加利福尼亚最高法院工作，并致力于涉及巴黎希尔顿，菲尔斯特斯特和迈克尔杰克逊的高调案件。私人调查员LuisBolaños拥有一连串的监视和反恐专业。萨拉再次同意每月20,000美元的预算。 Levine认为默多克的内疚或无罪无关紧要的问题。 “查克被缝了起来了，”他告诉我。 “对我来说足够了。他做到了吗？我真的不知道，不在乎，因为他应该出来。“</p><p>          Levine and Sax quickly dispensed of the weapons charge by arranging a plea deal. The team then coalesced around one goal: finding new evidence so they could file another appeal. It was a nearly impossible challenge since this new evidence had to meet one critical legal requirement: It could not have been known to Murdoch or his defense at the time of the 1994 trial. They would start by tracking down old witnesses to see if their stories had changed. At the top of the list: Dino Dinardo and Dyanne Spence. Both had already proved elusive. Given Sara’s knowledge of the case and affinity for research, at one point Bolaños suggested adding her to his private investigator license. Murdoch’s case became her full-time job.</p><p>          Levine和Sax通过安排辩续的交易迅速分配武器费用。该团队随后派对围绕一个目标：寻找新的证据，以便他们可以提交另一个吸引力。这是一个几乎不可能的挑战，因为这种新的证据必须满足一个关键的法律要求：在1994年审判时，默多克或其防守无法了解。他们会首先追踪旧证人，看看他们的故事是否已经改变了。在列表之上：Dino Dinardo和Dyanne Spence。两者都已经证明是难以捉摸的。鉴于Sara对研究的情况和亲和力的了解，在一个点B​​olaños建议将她添加到他的私人调查员执照。默多克的案件成为她的全职工作。</p><p> Her book deadline was looming, and by this point, she’d already spent more than $250,000 on Murdoch’s case and had refinanced her house. Bob, 25 years her senior, was retired, and she was her family’s sole breadwinner. She had two children in college and another in high school. “I feel like all I’m doing,” she told me in an email, “is staving off a nervous breakdown.” She began to worry about her health. She suffered from stress-induced vertigo so severe she “heard maracas” every time she turned her head.</p><p> 她的书截止日期正在覆盖，到目前为止，她已经花了超过250,000美元的默多克的案件，并重新融资了她的房子。鲍勃，25年她的高级，退休了，她是她的家人的唯一养家糊口。她在大学和高中有两个孩子。 “我觉得我所做的一切，”她在一封电子邮件中告诉我，“扎出了紧张的崩溃。”她开始担心她的健康。她患有压力引起的眩晕如此严重的，她每次转过头时都会“听到玛拉慢斯”。</p><p>  Over the years, I often asked Sara why she continued to fight for someone’s life even as her own became endangered. Her answers were always variations on the same theme: If we don’t insist on the same standard of justice for the Murdochs of the world, how can we expect it for ourselves?</p><p>  多年来，我经常要求萨拉为什么甚至她继续为某人的生命而继续争取争夺。她的答案总是对同一个主题的变化：如果我们不坚持世界上默多克斯的司法标准，我们如何为自己期望它？</p><p> But during our interviews for this story, Sara added another layer to her answer: That she was a collector of strays — stray animals, stray causes, stray people. Growing up in London, Ontario, she was a shy and awkward loner, a violin prodigy whose best friends were feathered or furred. She has owned dozens of animals in her 52 years and treated them all with zealous devotion. She once airlifted her dog to Colorado in a private jet so it could receive a heart-valve transplant. When she discovered her cat had a paralyzed esophagus that prevented digestion, she got it a gastric-tube implant. Every three hours, day and night, she injected formula into his tube. When her horse ate a toxic plant, she ordered several blood transfusions, necessitating a hospital stay that totaled more than $10,000. She took in a friend’s daughter and raised her for years. She bought one of Murdoch’s daughters a computer and gave her $5,000 so she could return to school.</p><p> 但在我们对这个故事的采访中，Sara在她的答案中添加了另一层：她是一名跨越动物，流浪者，流浪者。在伦敦成长，安大略省，她是一个害羞而尴尬的孤独，一个小提琴神童，他们最好的朋友是羽毛或狂热的。她在她的52年里拥有数十只动物，并用热心的奉献治疗它们。她曾经在私人射流中乘坐狗飞往科罗拉多州，所以它可以接受心脏瓣膜移植。当她发现她的猫有一个瘫痪的食道，防止消化，她得到了胃管植入物。每三个小时，白天和夜晚，她将配方注入他的管子。当她的马吃有毒植物时，她订购了几种血液输血，需要住院住宿，总计超过10,000美元。她坐在一个朋友的女儿，多年举起了她。她买了一个默多克的女儿一部电脑，给了她5,000美元，所以她可以回到学校。</p><p> Such extravagance and generosity can seem excessive. But Sara is a stray herself — someone who, for many formative years, was hungry and terrified and desperate — and for her, those acts of selflessness are reparative, a means of resetting old fractures and evening karmic scores. In f</p><p> 这种奢侈和慷慨似乎过度。但萨拉是一个迷走的人 - 对于许多形成年份，饥肠辘辘，饥肠辘辘的人 - 而且对她而言，那些无私的行为是批准的，这是一种重置旧骨折和夜间业力的手段。在F.</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/03/24/a-bestselling-author-became-obsessed-with-freeing-a-man-from-prison-it-nearly-ruined-her-life">https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/03/24/a-bestselling-author-became-obsessed-with-freeing-a-man-from-prison-it-nearly-ruined-her-life</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/痴迷/">#痴迷</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/obsession/">#obsession</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
