The column was quickly lambasted: for factual errors, an inflammatory headline — “Send in the Troops” — and a feeling that the  Times should not be in the business of publishing arguments for the use of American troops to crack down on American citizens.  In response, dozens of the paper’s employees took to Twitter, writing in unison, “Running this puts Black @nytimes staffers in danger.”</p><p>在《纽约时报》发表了阿肯色州参议员汤姆·科顿(Tom Cotton)的一篇评论文章后，#新闻编辑室反馈频道于今年6月成立，文章主张部署军队平息因警察击毙乔治·弗洛伊德(George Floyd)而引发的全国性抗议活动引发的骚乱。该专栏很快遭到了猛烈抨击：因为事实错误，一个煽动性的标题--“派遣军队”--以及一种感觉，即时报不应该发表使用美国军队镇压美国公民的论据。对此，该报数十名员工在推特上异口同声地写道：“这样做会让纽约时报的Black@nyTimes员工处于危险之中。”</p><p>  This was a break from  Timesian tradition, which prohibited employees from expressing their anger at the paper to the broader world. So the staff turned to Slack, taking aim first at the column (“It’s very Bolsonaro of Op-Ed to run this”); then at the op-ed section’s editor, James Bennet (“We’re tiptoeing around the elephant in the room, trying not to notice the stink of the huge pile of crap it’s just dumped. Should JB be replaced?”); and, eventually, at the  Times itself. Employees of color felt unheard — “We love this institution, even though sometimes it feels like it doesn’t love us back” — while tech reporters worried the  Times’ defense of the column, in the name of an open consideration of a wide range of opinion, was making the paper  look like the companies its reporting was taking to task: “It is frustrating to hear some of the same excuses (we’re just a platform for ideas!) that our journalists and columnists have criticized tech CEOs for making.”</p><p>这打破了Timesian的传统，即禁止员工向更广泛的世界表达他们对该报的愤怒。于是，工作人员转向Slake，首先瞄准了专栏(“这很像专栏的博尔索纳罗(Bolsonaro)主持这篇文章”)；然后是专栏编辑詹姆斯·贝内特(James Bennet)(“我们正踮着脚尖绕着房间里的大象走来走去，试图不去注意它刚刚倾倒的一大堆垃圾发出的臭味。”)。JB应该被撤换吗？“)；最终，在《纽约时报》本身。有色人种的员工感觉没人听过--“我们爱这个机构，尽管有时感觉它不爱我们”--尽管科技记者担心时报以公开考虑广泛意见的名义为专栏辩护，让该报看起来像是它的报道受到指责的公司：“听到一些相同的借口令人沮丧(我们只是一个思想的平台！)。我们的记者和专栏作家批评科技公司的首席执行官们做出了这样的举动。</p><p>  In the weeks after the Cotton op-ed, #newsroom-feedback served as a heated pandemic-era office watercooler. This was healthy enough — albeit a distinctly un- Timesian way of handling dissent. The  Times had always been a place where employees grumbled in the cafeteria, and complaints might slowly wind their way to the editorial cabal atop the newsroom known as “the masthead,” at which point any decisions would be handed down quietly. Now, Dean Baquet, the paper’s executive editor, was in #newsroom-feedback, answering critiques about the  Times’ journalism from not only his reporters but also the paper’s software developers and data scientists.</p><p>在Cotton专栏发表后的几周里，#新闻编辑室反馈就像是大流行时代的办公室饮水机。这是相当健康的--尽管这是一种明显不符合时代精神的处理异见的方式。《纽约时报》一直是员工在自助餐厅发牢骚的地方，抱怨可能会慢慢传到新闻编辑室顶部的编辑阴谋集团，在那里，任何决定都会悄悄下达。现在，该报执行主编迪恩·巴奎(Dean Baquet)进入了#新闻编辑室--反馈，回答的不仅是他的记者，还有该报的软件开发人员和数据科学家对《纽约时报》新闻报道的批评。</p><p>  The conversations could become tense. Employees would paste tweets criticizing the paper into the channel; the journalists would get defensive; someone would leak the argument to friends with Twitter accounts; and the ouroboros of self-criticism would take another bite out of its tail and everyone’s time. “Gang, it would be great to shift the tone of this discussion,” Baquet jumped in to say during a fight about whether  “Opinion”-section provocateur Bari Weiss’s description of a “civil war inside The New York  Times between the (mostly young) wokes [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals” was a reductive argument, a mischaracterization — or perhaps an unwelcome assessment with a modicum of truth.</p><p>谈话可能会变得紧张。员工们会将批评该报的推文粘贴到频道上；记者们会变得防御性；有人会将观点泄露给拥有Twitter账户的朋友；而自我批评的喧嚣又会占用该报的尾巴和每个人的时间。“伙计们，如果能改变讨论的语气，那就太棒了，”巴奎在一场争论中说。争论的焦点是，“观点”栏目的煽动者巴里·韦斯(Bari Weiss)对“纽约时报”内部“沃克斯(Wokes)派(主要是年轻人)和自由派(大多是40多岁)之间的内战”的描述是一种简化的争论、一种错误的描述--或者可能是一种带有些许真相的不受欢迎的评估。</p><p>  The dustup laid bare a divide that had become increasingly tricky for the  Times: a large portion of the paper’s audience, a number of its employees, and the president himself saw it as aligned with the #resistance. This demarcation horrified the Old Guard, but it seemed to make for good business. “The truth can change how we see the world,” the  Times declared in an advertisement broadcast at last year’s Academy Awards, positioning itself as a bulwark in an era of misinformation.</p><p>这场骚乱暴露了一个对时报来说越来越棘手的分歧：该报的很大一部分读者、许多员工，以及总统本人都认为它与#抵抗运动是一致的。这一划分令老卫士们感到恐惧，但它似乎有利于做好生意。“真相可以改变我们看待世界的方式，”纽约时报在去年奥斯卡颁奖典礼上播放的一则广告中宣称，将自己定位为一个错误信息时代的堡垒。</p><p>  On Election Night, as the  Times’ polling appeared to have overestimated Democratic response, subscribers experienced a partial repeat of 2016’s anguish about whether they were living in a bubble. Four years of upheaval and a summer of unrest, followed by the looming end of the Trump administration, had some inside the paper wondering the same thing. Was whatever might have been lost in the course of the Trump era gone for good — and good riddance?</p><p>在选举之夜，由于时报的民调似乎高估了民主党的反应，订阅者部分重演了2016年的痛苦，他们是否生活在泡沫中。四年的动乱和一个夏天的动荡，以及随后特朗普政府迫在眉睫的下台，让报纸内部的一些人对同样的事情产生了怀疑。在特朗普时代，一切可能失去的东西都一去不复返了吗？</p><p>    The  Times has a fitful relationship to self-examination. After the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal of the early aughts, it created a public-editor position to answer questions and critiques from readers, only to discard it in 2017, partly with the idea that Twitter could do the same job. The paper also created a standards department responsible for making sure the hundreds of pieces of journalism it publishes every day, in an increasing range of mediums, remain appropriately  Timesian. The department now has its own Slack channel, where editors and reporters can ask whether it’s acceptable to use the word  poop in a story about feces being tested for COVID-19 (verdict: “Best to avoid”) and how to decorously describe a recent Zoom incident at  The New Yorker (“Less is more in display type”).</p><p>《纽约时报》与自我反省的关系时断时续。在早期的杰森·布莱尔(Jayson Blair)抄袭丑闻之后，它设立了一个公共编辑职位，回答读者的问题和批评，但在2017年放弃了这个职位，部分原因是Twitter可以做同样的工作。该报还设立了一个标准部门，负责确保每天在越来越多的媒体上发表的数百篇新闻文章保持适当的时效性。该部门现在有了自己的松弛频道，编辑和记者可以在报道中询问在新冠肺炎的粪便检测中使用大便这个词是否可以接受(判决：“最好避免”)，以及如何礼貌地描述娱乐节目。</p><p>  The Trump era forced a rushed period of reflection. “I was part of the discussion with Dean when we first described Trump as lying on the front page,” Carolyn Ryan, one of 14 masthead editors at the  Times, told me recently. “It took 45 minutes.” The incident happened in September 2016, when Trump renounced his own birtherism, then falsely accused Hillary Clinton of starting the conspiracy theory. “It feels kind of quaint,” Ryan said of the decision. “But at the time, it was a shattering departure.”</p><p>特朗普时代迫使人们匆忙进行反思。“当我们第一次描述特朗普在头版撒谎时，我是和迪恩讨论的一部分，”时报的14名头版编辑之一卡罗琳·瑞安(Carolyn Ryan)最近告诉我。“花了45分钟。”这起事件发生在2016年9月，当时特朗普宣布放弃自己的出生论，然后错误地指责希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)开启了阴谋论。瑞安在谈到这一决定时说：“这感觉有点奇怪。”“但在当时，这是一次令人震惊的离开。”</p><p>  It was also a shattering departure for  Times journalists to walk into the newsroom after Trump’s 2016 victory and find their colleagues in tears. A neutral objectivity had long been core to the way the paper saw itself, its public mission, and its business interests (Abe Rosenthal, a legendary  Timesman, had the words HE KEPT THE PAPER STRAIGHT carved on his tombstone), even if it was an open secret that the  Times was published by and for coastal liberals. In 2004, the paper’s first public editor, Daniel Okrent, answered the headline above one of his columns — “Is the New York Times a Liberal Newspaper?” — in the first sentence of his story: “Of course it is.”</p><p>2016年特朗普胜选后，《纽约时报》记者走进新闻编辑室，发现他们的同事在流泪，这也是一次令人震惊的离开。长期以来，中立的客观性一直是该报看待自身、其公共使命和商业利益的核心(传奇的时报人阿贝·罗森塔尔(Abe Rosenthal)在他的墓碑上刻着这样的话)，尽管《纽约时报》是由沿海自由派出版的，而且是为沿海自由派出版的，这是一个公开的秘密。2004年，该报的第一位公共编辑丹尼尔·奥克伦特(Daniel Okrent)在他的一篇专栏文章的第一句话中回答了他的一个专栏--“纽约时报是一份自由派报纸吗？”--的标题：“当然是。”</p><p>    At an all-staff meeting shortly after the 2016 election, Baquet told the paper’s staff that it could not become part of the “loyal opposition” to Trump. The  Times would report on Trump aggressively — the paper earmarked an extra $5 million to cover the administration in 2017 — but fairly, so that the paper could maintain its “journalistic weapon,” as one of its star writers put it to me, meaning the ability to publish something like Trump’s tax returns and have them be viewed as unbiased truth. “Some read it and like it. Some read it and don’t like it,” Richard Nixon said of the  Times. “But  everybody reads it.”</p><p>在2016年大选后不久的一次全体员工会议上，巴奎告诉该报的员工，该报不能成为特朗普的“忠诚反对党”的一部分。时报会积极报道特朗普--该报拨出额外500万美元用于报道2017年的政府--但也是公平的，这样该报才能保持其“新闻武器”，正如该报的一位明星撰稿人对我所说的那样，这意味着有能力发表像特朗普的纳税申报单这样的东西，并让它们被视为不偏不倚的真相。“有些人读了之后很喜欢。理查德·尼克松在谈到《泰晤士报》时说：“有些人读了之后就不喜欢了。”“但每个人都会读这本书。”</p><p>  Trump presented the newsroom with a series of unprecedented questions. Do you call out his racism in a headline? The masthead’s answer was, in short: Yes, albeit sparingly and with purpose.</p><p>特朗普向新闻编辑部提出了一系列史无前例的问题。你有没有在头条上大骂他的种族主义？简而言之，报头的回答是：是的，尽管谨慎而有目的。</p><p>  But the paper’s claim to holding the independent center was already slipping, as the staff came to grips with an increasingly polarized audience. Journalists were caught between the desire to appear objective to right-leaning readers and sources — while avoiding backlash from left-leaning ones — and wishing they could get back to the job they thought they had signed up for. Most of the pressure to serve as the loyal opposition was coming from the outside: A Pew poll found that 91 percent of people who consider the  Times their primary news source identify as Democrats, roughly the same as the percentage of Fox News viewers who identify as Republicans. In August 2019, the paper ran a front-page headline — “Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism” — that caused enough uproar on the left about reputation laundering on the president’s behalf that it was eventually changed to “Assailing Hate But Not Guns,” at which point the president himself joined the fray. “ ‘Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism,’ was the correct description in the first headline by the Failing New York Times,” he tweeted. “Fake News - That’s what we’re up against.”</p><p>但随着该报工作人员开始迎合日益两极分化的受众，该报保持独立中心的主张已经在下滑。记者们进退两难，一方面希望对右倾读者和消息来源表现出客观的态度--同时避免左倾读者的反弹--另一方面又希望自己能回到自己认为已经签约的工作岗位上。成为忠诚的反对党的大部分压力来自外部：皮尤(Pew)的一项民意调查发现，在认为时报是他们的主要新闻来源的人中，91%的人认为自己是民主党人，这与福克斯新闻频道(Fox News)的观众认为自己是共和党人的比例大致相同。2019年8月，该报在头版刊登了一篇题为《特朗普敦促团结对抗种族主义》(Trump Urges Unity vs种族主义)的文章。这篇文章在左翼人士中引起了足够的轩然大波，内容是代表总统洗牌，最终改成了“抨击仇恨但不抨击枪手”，总统本人也加入了这场争斗。“ ‘Trump敦促团结VS。他在推特上写道：“种族主义，‘是失败的”纽约时报“第一个标题的正确描述。”“假新闻--这就是我们要面对的。”</p><p>  But the  Timesian impulse toward some kind of objectivity ignored the fact that the view from nowhere was actually too often a view from the Upper West Side and Montclair, New Jersey. “The whiteness of the paper has sometimes been a problem because it makes a bunch of nonwhite people run around like Cassandras — that’s what 2015 and 2016 felt like,” Wesley Morris, the paper’s critic-at-large, told me recently, noting that many employees of color were perplexed by the paper’s initial reluctance to call out Trump for his most brazen expressions of authoritarianism and racism. “Watching that awareness change in four years has been really interesting,” said Morris.</p><p>但是，时间主义追求某种客观性的冲动忽略了一个事实，那就是从无处可见的视角实际上太多地来自上西区和新泽西州的蒙特克莱尔(Montclair)。“该报的白度有时是个问题，因为它让一群非白人像卡桑德拉一样到处跑--这就是2015年和2016年的感觉，”该报的自由批评者韦斯利·莫里斯(Wesley Morris)最近告诉我。他指出，该报最初不愿指责特朗普最肆无忌惮地表达威权主义和种族主义，这让很多有色人种员工感到困惑。莫里斯说：“看着这一意识在四年内发生变化真的很有趣。”</p><p>    When the Cotton op-ed was published in June, the  Times was already “a tinderbox,” as one Black employee said to me. Everyone had been stuck inside for three months, and Black Lives Matter protests were now rolling across the country.  White Fragility and  How to Be an Antiracist were surging toward the top of the  Times’ best-seller list. More than 500  Times employees signed up for what one of the organizers called “Brave Space” events — a recasting of the phrase “safe space” — set up by the Black@NYT employee-resource group to talk about equity, allyship, and self-care in an incredibly stressful time for many.</p><p>正如一位黑人员工对我说的那样，当《棉花》专栏在6月份出版时，《纽约时报》已经是一个“火药桶”了。每个人都被困在里面三个月了，黑色生命也是抗议活动现在正在全国范围内滚动。《白人的脆弱》和《如何成为反种族主义者》登上了《纽约时报》畅销书排行榜的榜首。500多名时报员工报名参加了被组织者之一称为“勇敢空间”(Brave Space)的活动--这是对“安全空间”(Safe Space)一词的重新演绎--由Black@NYT员工资源小组设立，目的是在对许多人来说压力极大的时候谈论公平、友情和自我照顾。</p><p>  Cotton’s column lit a match. During a company town hall two days later, while Bennet got teary answering questions, employees took to Slack again to express their frustration at the company’s seeming lack of action to rectify the situation. Bennet had joined the  Times in 2016 with an explicit mandate to expand the voices in the op-ed pages beyond the center-left consensus in which most of its columnists fit. The “Opinion” section had suffered a number of controversies, and the newsroom had become frustrated with what seemed to be an alternate set of standards. Employees were galled to find out that Bennet had not read the column before it was published — while a Black photo editor had done so and objected to no avail. A development editor connected Cotton’s op-ed with a profile of Adolf Hitler from 1922, while an employee in brand marketing asked why  Alison Roman, the food writer who had recently been suspended for disparaging comments she made about Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo, was seemingly being treated more severely than Bennet.</p><p>科顿的专栏点燃了一根火柴。两天后，在一家公司的市政厅里，当贝内特含泪回答问题时，员工们再次在Slack上表达了他们对公司似乎没有采取行动纠正这种情况的失望之情。贝内特于2016年加入时报，明确授权扩大社论版的声音，超越该报大多数专栏作家所认同的中左翼共识。《观点》栏目遭遇了许多争议，新闻编辑部对另一套似乎是另一套标准感到沮丧。电磁脉冲</p><p>    The conversation turned into what more than one  Times employee described to me as a “food fight.” During the mêlée, “Opinion” columnist Elizabeth Bruenig uploaded a PDF of John Rawls’s treatise on public reason, in an attempt to elevate the discussion. “What we’re having is really a philosophical conversation, and it concerns the unfinished business of liberalism,” Bruenig wrote. “I think that all human beings are born philosophers, that is, that we all have an innate desire to understand what our world means and what we owe to one another and how to live good lives.”</p><p>谈话变成了不止一名时报员工对我所说的“食物之争”。在见面会期间，《观点》专栏作家伊丽莎白·布鲁尼格上传了约翰·罗尔斯关于公共理性的论文的PDF文档，试图提升讨论的层次。布鲁尼格写道：“我们正在进行的是一场真正的哲学对话，它关系到自由主义的未竟事业。”“我认为，所有人都是天生的哲学家，也就是说，我们都有一种与生俱来的愿望，想要了解我们的世界意味着什么，我们对彼此有什么亏欠，以及如何过上美好的生活。”</p><p>  “Philosophy schmosiphy,” wrote a researcher at the  Times whose Slack avatar was the logo for the hamburger chain Jack in the Box. “We’re at a barricades moment in our history. You decide: which side are you on?”</p><p>《泰晤士报》的一位研究人员写道，他的Slack头像是汉堡连锁店Jack in the Box的标识。他说：“我们正处在我们历史上的一个关卡时刻。你来决定：你站在哪一边？“。</p><p>  By Monday morning,  Bennet was out. To those who saw the op-ed as one in a series of screwups, Bennet’s ouster was a long time coming. To those who believed his effort to present occasionally controversial views for public consideration was core to the  Times’ mission, the decision was a retreat from principle. “I call it a fucking disgrace,” said Daniel Okrent, the former public editor. “I think that James’s firing was as meaningful for how the paper is perceived as Jayson Blair was.”</p><p>到了周一早上，贝内特已经出局了。对于那些认为这篇评论文章是一系列混乱中的一个的人来说，贝内特的下台来得太久了。对于那些认为他努力提出偶尔有争议的观点以供公众考虑是时报使命的核心的人来说，这一决定是对原则的一种倒退。“我称之为他妈的耻辱，”前公共编辑丹尼尔·奥克伦特(Daniel Okrent)说。“我认为詹姆斯被解雇对人们对该报的看法和杰森·布莱尔一样有意义。”</p><p>    In the weeks that followed, one “Opinion” staffer told me it felt like no one at the  Times got any work done at all. There were focus groups — 38 of them and counting — and working groups and innumerable conversations about what the paper should be and look like and who it was for. The masthead started holding “Black-people meetings,” as one Black employee put it to me, in which members of the masthead talked one-on-one with employees of color to sort out why they felt the  Times was an unwelcoming place. In #newsroom-feedback, there were many days in which several people were typing.</p><p>在接下来的几周里，一位《观点》杂志的员工告诉我，《纽约时报》好像没有人完成任何工作。有焦点小组-38个，而且还在增加-还有工作组和无数关于报纸应该是什么，看起来是什么样子，以及它是为谁而写的讨论。正如一位黑人员工对我说的那样，报头开始举行“黑人会议”，报头成员与有色人种员工一对一地交谈，找出为什么他们觉得时报是一个不受欢迎的地方。在#新闻编辑室反馈中，有很多天有几个人在打字。</p><p>  The gears of institutional change were slowly churning, as they had before. The  Times had long been a relative monoculture: Ivy League–educated white people writing for their cohort. Some blamed this bubble on the paper’s dismissal of Trump in 2016 — not that any other mainstream media outlets had done any better. Since then, as business boomed in the Trump era, it had gone on a newsroom hiring spree, with a particular focus on trying to diversify its ranks: 40 percent of newsroom employees hired since 2016 have been people of color.</p><p>制度变革的齿轮正在缓慢转动，就像以前一样。长期以来，《纽约时报》一直是一种相对单一的文化：毕业于常春藤盟校的白人为他们的同龄人写作。一些人将这种泡沫归咎于2016年该报对特朗普的解雇--并不是说其他主流媒体做得更好。从那时起，随着业务在特朗普时代蓬勃发展，新闻编辑部掀起了招聘狂潮，尤其注重于努力实现队伍多元化：自2016年以来，新闻编辑部40%的员工都是有色人种。</p><p>  Several Black employees told me that the  Times was the most diverse newsroom they had ever worked in, but simply hiring more young Black reporters wasn’t a cure-all. “There’s a pipeline problem,” one Black staffer told me. The newsroom joke, one reporter said, was that the masthead farmed diversity and inclusion to the softer sections of the paper — “Styles,” “Arts &amp; Leisure,”  The New York Times  Magazine — so that “they could hire any white guy they wanted in D.C.” The paper’s more senior ranks were less diverse; it seemed to have structural problems that were limiting the promotion of Black employees. A newly instituted performance-review process gives every  Times employee one of six ratings; the lowest is reserved for employees who don’t meet expectations, with the other five in ascending order, from “Partially Meets Expectations” to “Substantially Surpasses Expectations.” A study conducted by members of the  Times’ editorial union found that in 2019 Black and Hispanic employees received 33 percent of the former rating, despite making up only 16 percent of the staff, while receiving less than 5 percent of the highest rating.</p><p>几名黑人员工告诉我，时报是他们工作过的最多元化的新闻编辑部，但简单地雇佣更多年轻的黑人记者并不是万灵丹。“管道有问题，”一位黑人员工告诉我。一位记者说，新闻编辑部的一个笑话是，报头把多样性和包容性融入了报纸较温和的版面--“Styles”、“Arts&Amp；休闲”、“纽约时报杂志”(New York Times Magazine)--这样“他们就可以在华盛顿雇佣任何他们想要的白人”。该报较高级别的职位没有那么多样化；它似乎存在结构性问题，限制了黑人员工的晋升。新建立的绩效评估流程给每一位纽约时报员工打出了六分中的一分；最低的是没有达到预期的员工，其余五分按升序排列，从“部分达到预期”到“大大超出预期”。纽约时报编辑工会成员进行的一项研究发现，2019年，黑人和西班牙裔员工获得了前一次评分的33%，尽管只占员工总数的16%，但获得的最高评分还不到5%。</p><p>  Everyone I spoke to at the  Times thought the place needed to diversify: more Black journalists, more Evangelical Christians, more Cuban émigrés, more “people who grew up on ranches who aren’t Nick Kristof,” as one put it. The racial-justice reckoning that shook the nation this summer brought a new urgency to the effort. Managers were required to attend unconscious-bias training. The  Times Magazine commissioned a diversity study of bylines and subject matter “to quantify what everyone already knows,” as one staffer put it. The  Times gave employees the day off on Juneteenth, which marks the emancipation of America’s slaves. The efforts felt sincere, but everyone knew the road to real change would be long. All employees could do was sigh when one masthead editor explained, in a town-hall meeting, that the paper’s diversity study was being led by Ivy Planning Group, a consulting firm named for the fact that its three founders all went to Ivy League schools.</p><p>我在时报采访的每个人都认为这个地方需要多元化：更多的黑人记者，更多的福音派基督徒，更多的古巴移民，更多的“在牧场长大的人，他们不是尼克·克里斯托夫(Nick Kristof)，”其中一人说。今年夏天震惊全国的种族正义清算给这项努力带来了新的紧迫性。经理们被要求参加无意识偏见培训。正如一位工作人员所说，“时代杂志”委托进行了一项关于署名和主题的多样性研究，“以量化每个人已经知道的内容”。《泰晤士报》在6月19日给员工放假，这标志着美国奴隶的解放。这些努力看起来是真诚的，但每个人都知道，真正的变革之路将是漫长的。当一位报头编辑在一次市政厅会议上解释说，该报的多样性研究由常春藤规划集团(Ivy Planning Group)领导时，员工们只能叹息。常春藤规划集团是一家咨询公司，以其三名创始人都曾就读常春藤盟校的事实命名。</p><p>  What the paper did have — in increasing numbers in fact — was a growing cohort of people who came to the paper with a different set of values. They were younger, which produced some of the division. A reporter who identified as “young Gen X” warned me about “toxic millennial workplace values,” while a millennial complained about the masthead’s tortured relationship to social media by arguing that “boomer is a mind-set.”</p><p>事实上，这份报纸确实拥有越来越多的人，他们带着一套不同的价值观来到这份报纸。他们更年轻，这就产生了一些部门。一位自称“年轻的X世代”的记者警告我要提防“有毒的千禧一代职场价值观”，而另一位千禧一代则抱怨这位报头与社交媒体的关系过于曲折，认为“婴儿潮一代是一种思维定势”。</p><p>  But the most meaningful divide in the newsroom seemed to be by temperament. “The fundamental schism at the  Times is institutionalist versus insurrectionist,” a reporter  who identified with the latter group told me. (Almost all of the dozens of  Times employees I spoke to for this story requested varying degrees of anonymity; one told me, “You can refer to me as a ‘woke millennial reporter’ or whatever.”) The institutionalists were willing to play the internal  Game of Thrones required to ascend the masthead because they never wanted to work anywhere else. The insurrectionists, meanwhile, had often come from digital outlets or tech companies or advocacy groups and could imagine leaving the place at any time. (The newsroom noticed that some employees of “Wirecutter,” the most capitalist arm of the  Times’ editorial operation, appeared to be the most socialist on Slack.) “I love my job. I  like my co-workers. But it has not been my goal since I was 12 to work for the New York  Times,” the “woke millennial reporter” told me. “I’m not so blinded by how great the place is that I’m going to ignore the problems.”</p><p>但在新闻编辑部，最有意义的分歧似乎是性情。一位认同后者的记者告诉我：“纽约时报的根本分歧是制度主义者与起义者。”(就这篇报道与我交谈的数十名时报员工几乎都要求匿名；其中一人告诉我，“你可以称我为‘觉醒的千禧一代记者’或其他什么。”)。制度主义者愿意玩登上报头所需的内部权力游戏，因为他们从来不想在其他地方工作。与此同时，叛乱分子往往来自数字媒体、科技公司或倡导团体，他们可以想象随时离开这个地方。(新闻编辑部注意到，时报编辑部门最具资本主义色彩的《连线》杂志(Wirecutter)的一些员工似乎是《松弛》杂志上最具社会主义者的人。)。“我热爱我的工作。我和我的同事一样 。但从12岁起，为《纽约时报》工作并不是我的目标。“这位《觉醒的千禧一代记者》告诉我。“我不会因为这个地方有多棒而被蒙蔽了双眼，所以我不会忽视这些问题。”</p><p>  Many of the insurrectionists were coming from places the  Times didn’t traditionally recruit from, like new digital-media companies and outlets that practiced advocacy journalism, and part of the challenge had become integrating those employees into the  Timesian way of operating. “There’s a generation at the  Times that’s kind of been raised by wolves, by  Times standards,” one institutionalist told me. The new recruits were brought in to help supercharge the company’s efforts at modernizing its news operation, but the  Times hadn’t fully understand what it would mean to have a new breed of journalist inside the building. “We set out to diversify the newsroom, but didn’t say, ‘Isn’t the next step to take what these new voices have to bring?’” Baquet said on the  Longform podcast this summer. “We started hiring from BuzzFeed; we started hiring from other places, and it was almost like we thought,  Okay, now they’re just going to become just like us.”</p><p>许多起义者来自《纽约时报》传统上不会招聘的地方，比如新的数字媒体公司和从事宣传性新闻的媒体，其中一个挑战是让这些员工融入《纽约时报》的运营方式。“按照时报的标准，时报有一代人是被狼养大的，”一位机构主义者告诉我。这些新员工的加入是为了帮助公司推进新闻运营现代化的努力，但时报并不完全理解在大楼里拥有一名新一代的记者意味着什么。“我们打算让新闻编辑部多元化，但没有说，‘下一步不是要采取这些新声音必须带来的东西吗？’”巴奎今年夏天在长篇播客上说。“我们开始从BuzzFeed招聘；我们开始从其他地方招聘，几乎就像我们想的那样，好吧，现在他们会变得和我们一样。”</p><p>  Of all the fronts on which the  Times was being pushed to change, the strongest insurrectionary energy was coming from legions of newsroom-adjacent employees in digital jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago. The employees responsible for distributing the  Times in the past — typesetters, pressmen, delivery drivers — had never been encouraged to speak up about the ethical questions at the heart of the paper’s journalism. But the app developers and software engineers who deliver the  Times’ journalism to the world have held their hands up in just as many Ivy League seminars as their editorial peers. They might be too shy to march over to a masthead editor and complain about a clumsy headline, but #newsroom-feedback had opened a digital door to criticism. Reporters found that suddenly it was the  Times’ programmers and developers, rather than their editors, who were critiquing their work. During the town hall about the Cotton op-ed, one data engineer said on Slack, “How many such process failures would be tolerated in tech?”</p><p>在《纽约时报》被推动变革的所有战线中，最强烈的反叛能量来自与编辑部相邻的大批从事数字工作的员工，而这些工作在十年前还不存在。过去负责发行《泰晤士报》的员工--排字工人、报社记者和送货司机--从未被鼓励公开谈论该报新闻报道的核心伦理问题。但是，向世界传递《纽约时报》新闻的应用程序开发人员和软件工程师在常春藤盟校的研讨会上举手的次数与他们的编辑同行一样多。他们可能太害羞了，不敢走到报头编辑面前，抱怨一个笨拙的标题，但#新闻编辑室的反馈已经为批评打开了一扇数字大门。记者们发现，突然间，批评他们工作的是时报的程序员和开发人员，而不是他们的编辑。在市政厅讨论Cotton专栏时，一位数据工程师在Slack上说，“科技行业能容忍多少这样的流程失败？”</p><p>  Many of the techsurrectionists had come from Facebook or Uber or Amazon to join the  Times out of a sense of mission, leaving the ethical quandaries of the tech industry for what they thought were more virtuous pastures. “I joined the company for one reason, and it’s because I feel a responsibility to be a part of a mission that I believe in,” a product manager who previously worked at Apple wrote in #newsroom-feedback after the Cotton op-ed. “This feels like the rug’s been pulled out from under us — not just because it feels like that mission [has] been severely compromised by the decision to publish this piece, but even more so because the products we’re building were used to do it.”</p><p>许多技术专家来自Facebook、优步(Uber)或亚马逊(Amazon)，出于使命感加入了时报，离开了科技行业的伦理困境，去了他们认为更有道德的地方。“我加入公司只有一个原因，那就是我觉得有责任成为我所信奉的使命的一部分，”一位曾在苹果工作的产品经理在#Cotton专栏之后的#新闻编辑部反馈中写道。“这给人的感觉就像是从我们手中拔出了地毯--不仅是因为发表这篇文章的决定严重损害了我们的使命，更是因为我们正在开发的产品就是用来做这件事的。”</p><p>  “It’s like making telephone poles,” one software engineer added, “and finding out they’re being used as battering rams.”</p><p>“这就像做电线杆一样，”一位软件工程师补充道，“结果发现电线杆被用作撞击锤。”</p><p>  Everyone in the newsroom recognized that they were beholden to the techsurrectionists, who didn’t seem to understand the messy humanness that went into the  Times’ journalism, but did hold the keys to its business future. “We are competing for talent with the Googles and Facebooks, and what we have to offer these smart, talented people is our mission,” Carolyn Ryan told me. “Now, we’re at this inflection point where people to whom we have said ‘Come be part of this mission’ also want to raise their hand w</p><p>新闻编辑部的每个人都意识到，他们受惠于技术专家，他们似乎不理解时报新闻报道中的杂乱无章的人性，但他们确实掌握着时报商业未来的关键。卡罗琳·瑞安告诉我：“我们正在与谷歌和Facebook争夺人才，我们要为这些聪明、有才华的人提供的是我们的使命。”“现在，我们正处在一个转折点上，我们说过‘来参与这项使命’的人们也想举起手来。”</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div
