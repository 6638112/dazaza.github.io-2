The S&amp;P 500 index finished the year up 18.4%; this despite being down by as much as 30% in March, making 2020 one of the wildest swinging markets in history.</p><p>2020年是我一生中最迷人，最无聊的一年，尽管历史上最猛烈的市场崩盘和有史以来最严重的衰退，美国股市投资者又度过了一个美好的一年。标普500指数年底上涨了18.4％。尽管在三月份下降了30％，但这使2020年成为历史上最疯狂的波动市场之一。</p><p>      But if you didn’t earn double digit returns last year you were in good company. The bull market was extremely concentrated in a narrow subset of stocks and most others floundered over the year. By my count, of the top 5,000 stocks trading on US exchanges (this includes over a thousand foreign stocks with US listings), only a little over half finished 2020 in positive territory and the median return was only 4.3%. If you didn’t have the good fortune to buy the few winners you were left behind, as happened with some of the industry’s best. Many of the world’s largest and previously most successful hedge funds and institutional money managers had a terrible 2020, including the top two: Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates and Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies, each famous for their billionaire visionary founders, uniquely   secretive/ creepy company culture, and astounding market-beating performance over decades, each suffered  negative double-digit returns in their main funds in 2020. Similarly, some of the industry’s most highly regarded names such as   AQR,   Two Sigma, and   Dimensional Fund Advisors all suffered massive investor redemptions in the face of substantial underperformance in 2020.</p><p>      但是，如果您去年没有获得两位数的回报，那么您的公司就不错。牛市极其集中在一小部分股票中，大多数其他股票在这一年中陷入困境。根据我的统计，在美国交易所交易的前5,000只股票中（包括超过一千种在美国上市的外国股票），到2020年，只有略多于一半的股票在正数区域内交易，中位数收益率仅为4.3％。如果您没有足够的财富来购买少数几位获奖者，那么您会被甩在后面，就像业内最好的一些人一样。许多世界上最大，以前最成功的对冲基金和机构资金管理公司在2020年都经历了可怕的一年，其中包括前两名：雷·达里奥（Ray Dalio）的Bridgewater Associates和吉姆·西蒙（Jim Simon）的Renaissance Technologies，他们各自以亿万富翁的有远见的创始人，独特的秘密/令人毛骨悚然的公司文化而闻名，以及数十年来惊人的市场表现，每只基金在2020年的主要基金均遭受负两位数的回报。同样，一些业内最受尊敬的公司，如AQR，Two Sigma和Dimensional Fund Advisors都在2006年遭受了大规模的投资者赎回。面对2020年的大幅下滑。</p><p>  All these fund managers pursue a variety of different strategies in a variety of different markets, but they all have one thing in common: they’re quants. They take a data-driven approach to investing, using mathematical models based typically on decades of market returns to execute their strategy, often employing teams of Ph.D mathematicians, computer scientists, and economists to crunch the numbers. They generally pay little attention to the “human interest” elements of investing like the executive bio or squishy concepts like “product market fit” or five year strategic plans. There are a lot of different ways to be a quant, but if you are one, or invested with one in 2020, you probably had a bad year. 2020 was the year of the swashbuckling stock-picker. As Bloomberg declared in a year-end article,   Human-Run Hedge Funds Trounce Quants in Covid Year. 2020 was the revenge  against the nerds.</p><p>  所有这些基金经理在各种不同的市场中奉行各种不同的策略，但是它们都有一个共同点：量化指标。他们采用数据驱动的方法进行投资，使用通常基于数十年市场回报的数学模型来执行其策略，经常聘用博士数学家，计算机科学家和经济学家组成的团队来计算数字。他们通常很少关注投资的“人的利益”要素，例如高管生物或诸如“产品市场契合度”或五年战略计划之类的糊涂概念。量化有很多不同的方法，但是如果您是一个量化分析师，或者在2020年进行量化投资，则可能是糟糕的一年。 2020年是选择股票的一年。正如彭博社在年终文章中所宣布的那样，“人类对冲基金在Covid Year中的交易量”。 2020年是对书呆子的报仇。</p><p>  So what happened? Leo Tolstoy famously wrote, “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” So it was with investing in 2020, there were many different investing strategies that went unhappily in 2020, and all the strategies that went happily looked pretty much the same. Let’s look at the unhappy families first and then return to the one thing that went well in 2020.</p><p>  所以发生了什么事？列夫·托尔斯泰（Leo Tolstoy）著名地写道：“所有幸福的家庭都一样。每个不幸的家庭都会以自己的方式感到不幸。”在2020年进行投资时，有很多不同的投资策略在2020年失败了，而所有成功进行的策略看起来都差不多。首先让我们看看不幸的家庭，然后再回到2020年的大事。</p><p>    2020 saw a repeat of something we’ve witnessed a few times in the last decade, not only did US stocks have an especially good year, they did substantially better than pretty much every other market. Investors who diversified across multiple asset classes therefore had much weaker returns.</p><p>    2020年是我们在过去十年中亲眼目睹的事情的重演，不仅美国股市表现特别出色，而且其表现远好于几乎所有其他市场。因此，在多种资产类别中进行多元化投资的投资者的收益要弱得多。</p><p>    Just about the only major asset that beat the S&amp;P 500 last year was gold. The shiny metal held its weight during the crisis in March and powered through the rest of the year. Emerging market stocks also put in a solid year, virtually tied with the US market, despite suffering an even harder crash in March. Most other major assets, however, had much more modest returns, including the stock markets of most other rich, industrialized nations. Investors diversified across these major markets still likely had reasonably positive returns, but were a far cry from the meteoric rise of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>    去年，几乎唯一击败标普500指数的主要资产就是黄金。 3月份的危机期间，这种闪亮的金属保持了重量，并在今年余下的时间里保持供电。新兴市场股票也表现强劲，几乎与美国市场息息相关，尽管3月份遭受的冲击甚至更大。但是，大多数其他主要资产的回报率要低得多，包括大多数其他富裕工业化国家的股票市场。在这些主要市场中分散投资的投资者仍可能获得合理的正回报，但与标准普尔500指数的迅猛增长相去甚远。</p><p>  Of course, how investors allocated both across and within these asset classes was of tantamount importance to their outcomes in 2020, and generally these outcomes frustrated quants at every turn. Whether picking stocks within a market or allocating across asset classes, quants often rely on measures of valuation, volatility, or momentum to guide their process, based on the historical success of these metrics in predicting returns, and in nearly every case following the numbers led investors astray in 2020, starting with perhaps the most time-tested of financial strategies, value investing.</p><p>  当然，投资者如何在这些资产类别之间和之内进行分配对他们在2020年的业绩至关重要，通常，这些成果动every动摇了量化指标。无论是在市场中挑选股票还是在资产类别中进行分配，量化指标通常都基于估值，波动性或动量的指标来指导其流程，这些指标基于这些指标在预测收益方面的历史成功率，并且几乎在每种情况下都遵循数字投资者可能会在2020年误入歧途，首先可能是经过时间考验最久的财务策略，即价值投资。 </p><p>    For investors like yours truly who believe markets ultimately have to have some   relation to reality, the following joke tweet from December is a little too on the nose.</p><p>对于像您这样的真正相信市场最终必须与现实有一定联系的投资者，从12月开始的以下开玩笑的推文也有些牵强。</p><p>    Value investors ask the same seemingly reasonable question of investments we all ask when we’re considering buying a good or service: is the price I have to pay a good deal compared to the quality I’m getting? In practice this generally means value investors seek to buy assets whose prices are low relative to their cashflows or other economic fundamentals. Value investing has an intellectual pedigree going back to at least the 1920s with the classic writings of Graham and Dodd and is perhaps most famous for their most successful student, Warren Buffett (who also didn’t do so well last year). Value investing has been out of favor for several years now, especially in the US market, something I documented extensively in my   two part  series last year on market valuations.</p><p>    价值投资者提出了一个看似合理的投资问题，当我们考虑购买商品或服务时，我们都会问这个问题：与我要获得的质量相比，我必须付出高昂的价格吗？实际上，这通常意味着价值投资者寻求购买价格相对于其现金流量或其他经济基础而言较低的资产。价值投资的知识分子血统至少可以追溯到1920年代，其中包括Graham和Dodd的经典著作，也许以最成功的学生沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）而闻名（后者去年也表现不佳）。几年来，价值投资一直不受欢迎，尤其是在美国市场上，我去年在我的第二部分系列中就市场估值做了广泛记录。</p><p>  Last year was a miserable one for value investors. Within the US market, value stocks lagged the market in the first couple months, fell further during the crash, and recovered slower than the rest of the market. Though they rallied harder in the last two months of the year, value stock both large and small finished the year finished the year just barely above zero, as judged by the commonly followed Russell 1000 Value (large stocks) and Russell 2000 Value (small stocks) indexes.</p><p>  去年对于价值投资者而言是悲惨的一年。在美国市场，价值股票在最初几个月中落后于市场，在崩盘期间进一步下跌，并且复苏速度慢于其他市场。尽管它们在一年的最后两个月里更加艰难地上涨，但大型和小型价值股在当年结束时才刚刚接近零以上，这是由通常遵循的Russell 1000价值（大型股票）和Russell 2000价值（小型股票）判断的）索引。</p><p>      Applying the value effect around the world gave even worse results. Choosing between stock markets, the US started the year the most expensive market in the world, and those in Europe were among the cheapest. But as we saw, the US market became more expensive still, and European stock investors barely ended the year in positive territory. Value stocks within foreign markets similarly failed to keep up with their broader market aggregates. One index of value stocks around the world, the MSCI ACWI Value Index, finished the year up a mere 0.42%. Taking an even more expansive view of valuation and applying it across global assets, buying those stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies measured as cheap and selling those measured as expensive would have lost you about 12% in 2020 (through November) according to   AQR’s methodology.</p><p>      在全球范围内应用价值效应会产生更糟糕的结果。在股票市场之间进行选择，美国是当年全球最贵的市场，而欧洲则是最便宜的市场之一。但是，正如我们所看到的，美国市场仍然变得更加昂贵，欧洲股票投资者在这一年几乎没有出现积极的变化。同样，国外市场的价值股票也未能跟上其整体市场的总体走势。 MSCI ACWI价值指数是全球价值股票的一种指数，该年末仅上涨了0.42％。根据AQR的说法，如果对估值进行更宽泛的评估并将其应用于全球资产，那么购买那些以便宜价格衡量的股票，债券，商品和货币，然后卖出那些以昂贵价格衡量的货币，债券和商品，将使您损失约12％。方法。</p><p>  Skeptics of value investing often point out that value stocks are usually cheap for a reason: they’re junk. Indeed, if you simply sort the market based on a simple valuation metric like price to book ratio you’ll often find that the most undervalued stocks are in declining industries, have weak balance sheets and margins, and are projected to lose market share. Value investors often try to avoid “value traps” like this by augmenting their value factors with metrics to score some measure of “quality”, looking at profitability measures like return on equity, for example. Adding such quality filters would have only made things worse in 2020. Among the cheapest stocks in the market, the most profitable among them did the worst last year.</p><p>  价值投资的怀疑论者经常指出，价值股票通常便宜是有原因的：它们是垃圾。确实，如果您仅基于简单的估值指标（如市净率）对市场进行分类，您通常会发现，被低估的股票最多的行业是衰落的行业，资产负债表和利润率很低，并且预计会失去市场份额。价值投资者通常试图通过增加度量值来评估其“价值陷阱”，从而对某种“质量”进行评分，例如考虑诸如股本回报率之类的盈利性度量。添加如此优质的过滤器只会使情况在2020年变得更糟。在市场上最便宜的股票中，利润最高的股票去年的表现最差。</p><p>  Professor Ken French keeps an invaluable   online database to quants that records the track records to different portfolios of stocks sorted on a variety of metrics. Looking at a double-sorted portfolio of the stocks that are in the lowest quintile of valuation and the highest quintile of profitability, here’s how such a portfolio did last year (through November) compared to the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>  肯·法兰奇（Ken French）教授保留着一个宝贵的在线定量数据库，该数据库将跟踪记录记录到按各种指标分类的不同股票组合中。看一下估值最低的五分之一和获利能力最高的五分之一的股票的双重分类投资组合，下面是与标准普尔500指数相比，去年（截至11月）这种投资组合的情况。</p><p>  The most profitable, cheapest stocks in the US lost more than half of their value in the crash last year, before recovering to end up down “only” about 20% last year, a staggering 33.8% behind the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>  去年美国最赚钱，最便宜的股票在崩盘中损失了超过一半的价值，然后在去年回升，最终跌至“仅”约20％的水平，比标准普尔500指数低了33.8％。 </p><p>  Take a moment to consider how counterintuitive this ought to seem. I think most people, even without much financial savvy, would consider the strategy of “buy highly profitable companies at attractive valuations” to seem like a fairly reasonable one, the sort of things that might actually deliver superior results over the long run, and indeed if we look at the long run data it has, as we’ll see further down the page. You might even suspect that such a prudent strategy might shine especially during a period of great economic tumult and uncertainty, and indeed it often has historically. But that is absolutely  not what happened during the chaos of 2020. And that wasn’t the only curveball 2020 threw quants either.</p><p>花点时间考虑一下这看起来有多么违反直觉。我认为即使没有足够的财务知识，大多数人也会认为“以诱人的估值购买高利润的公司”这一战略似乎是一种合理的选择，从长远来看，这种事情实际上可能会产生出色的结果，并且的确如此。如果我们查看它具有的长期数据，则会在页面的下方看到。您甚至可能会怀疑，这种谨慎的策略可能会在特别大的经济动荡和不确定性时期大放异彩，而且从历史上看确实如此。但这绝对不是2020年混乱期间发生的事情。那也不是2020年唯一的曲线球投掷量词。</p><p>    After value, low volatility strategies are some of the most commonly used quant approaches of the last decade. Research going back to the 70s shows that those stocks whose prices are relatively more stable tend to roughly keep up with the rest of the market or nearly so when times are good, but lose far less value during panics and bear markets. Thus, over the long run they’ve done about as good or better as the rest of the market with a lot less risk. That is… decidedly not what happened last year. Within the US market, two of the most popular quant funds of recent years have been the iShares US Minimum Volatility ETF and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF, two ETFs that use a quantitative approach to pick the least volatile stocks within the US market. With tens of billions of dollars between them, here’s how these two flavors of low volatility stock investing did last year.</p><p>    扣除价值后，低波动策略是过去十年中最常用的量化方法。可以追溯到70年代的研究表明，那些价格相对较为稳定的股票往往大致赶上其他市场，或者在情况好的时候差不多赶上其他市场，但在恐慌和熊市期间损失的价值要少得多。因此，从长远来看，他们所做的工作与市场上的其他公司一样好或更好，而风险却要低得多。那是……绝对不是去年发生的事情。在美国市场上，近年来最受欢迎的两只量化基金是iShares美国最小波动性ETF和Invesco S＆amp; P 500低波动性ETF，这两种ETF使用定量方法来挑选美国波动性最小的股票。市场。两者之间的交易额高达数百亿美元，这就是去年这两种低波动率股票投资的表现。</p><p>      Yikes. Low volatility investing in the US was just about as bad as value investing was, despite being a completely different conceptual approach and not being very much correlated with each other. Though they have tended to lose less in previous bear markets, low volatility stocks lost just as much as the rest of the market during the COVID crash, but experienced a much more muted recovery. They were only low volatility when you didn’t want them to be! Results in foreign stock markets were similar, if not quite so extreme. Depending on what methodology you used, low volatility stocks in international developed and emerging markets underperformed their broad market counterparts by several percentage points in 2020.</p><p>      kes。尽管是完全不同的概念方法并且彼此之间的关联度不高，但在美国进行低波动性投资与进行价值投资一样糟糕。尽管它们在以前的熊市中损失往往较小，但在COVID崩溃期间，低波动率股票的损失与其他市场一样多，但复苏却更为缓慢。当您不希望它们出现时，它们只有低波动性！即便不是那么极端，外国股票市场的结果也差不多。根据您使用的方法，到2020年，国际发达市场和新兴市场的低波动率股票要比其广泛市场的同类股票差几个百分点。</p><p>  A cousin of low volatility investing is Risk Parity, which is usually applied to entire markets for use as an asset allocation technique. Risk Parity strategies invest in asset classes weighting them inversely proportional to their volatility (or other measures of risk such as beta). This means less risky asset classes like bonds tend to get higher weights than stocks, and the relative weights adapt dynamically to changing volatility dynamics in the market. Because a typical risk parity portfolio is fairly conservatively allocated, leverage is then usually applied to it in order to achieve a certain target level of risk.</p><p>  低波动性投资的一个表亲是风险平价，它通常应用于整个市场，用作资产分配技术。风险平价策略投资于资产类别，使其权重与其波动率（或其他风险度量标准，例如Beta）成反比。这意味着像债券这样的风险较小的资产类别往往比股票具有更高的权重，并且相对权重可以动态地适应不断变化的市场波动动态。由于典型的风险平价投资组合是相当保守地分配的，因此通常会对其施加杠杆作用，以达到一定的目标风险水平。</p><p>  I’ve   written before on this blog about how Risk Parity and related approaches to investing have historically delivered very desirable results, potentially beating a stocks-only allocation with lower risk and less-protracted bear markets. Unfortunately, as with low-risk investing in equities, 2020 turned this experience on its head. The largest risk parity fund available to individual investors is the one managed by the popular robo-advisor Wealthfront (arguably a quant for smaller investors). Their flagship fund finished the year down over 6%.</p><p>  我之前在此博客上写过关于风险平价及相关投资方法在历史上如何取得非常理想的结果的信息，这有可能击败风险较低且熊市时间较长的仅股票配置。不幸的是，与低风险的股票投资一样，2020年也使这种经历成为现实。个人投资者可获得的最大风险平价基金是由受欢迎的机器人顾问Wealthfront管理的基金（可以说是较小投资者的数量）。他们的旗舰基金全年下跌超过6％。</p><p>      This appears to a bit worse than usual, but pretty much all risk parity or related strategies suffered the same setback that plagued low volatility investing in equities: due to the extreme and sudden nature of the crash in March and the fact that it subsided almost as quickly, risk parity strategies couldn’t adapt quickly enough to protect on the downside, and reduced risk exposure just as the market was rebounding.</p><p>      这似乎比平常要差一些，但是几乎所有风险平价或相关策略都遭受了挫折，困扰着股票市场的低波动性投资：由于3月份崩溃的极端性和突然性，以及崩溃几乎平息了这一事实。很快，风险平价策略无法迅速适应不足以保护下行空间，并在市场反弹时降低了风险敞口。</p><p>    One quant strategy that’s all about adapting quickly is momentum investing, which refers simply to the strategy of buying those assets that have been outperforming recently (usually defined as the last 3-12 months) and selling those that have been underperforming. While traditional, fundamentals-oriented investors tend to look askance at momentum approaches (value investors say “buy low, sell high”, momentum investors say “buy high, sell higher”), the empirical data in support of it is vast. The momentum effect has been observed in virtually every market we have data on, sometimes going back centuries. Behavioral finance literature also provides   theoretical support for the momentum effect based on observations of investor overconfidence and overreaction.</p><p>    一种旨在快速适应的量化策略是动量投资，它只是指购买近期表现不佳（通常定义为过去3到12个月）的资产并出售表现不佳的资产的策略。尽管传统的，基本面导向的投资者倾向于对动量方法持怀疑态度（价值投资者说“低买高卖”，动量投资者说“高买高卖”），但支持它的经验数据却是巨大的。在几乎所有我们拥有数据的市场中，都观察到了动量效应，有时甚至可以追溯到几个世纪之前。行为金融文献还基于对投资者过度自信和过度反应的观察，为动量效应提供了理论支持。 </p><p>  Anyway, momentum investing in the stock market was one of the only bright spots for quants in 2020. Whether applied just within the US market or around the world, momentum stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 10% or more last year, as measured by MSCI’s momentum indexes.</p><p>无论如何，在股票市场上的动量投资是2020年量化指标的唯一亮点之一。无论是仅在美国市场还是在全球范围内使用，动量股票去年的表现都比标准普尔500指数高出10％甚至更多。通过MSCI的动量指标。</p><p>      Momentum strategies were piled into high-flying tech stocks at the start of the year, which went on suffer less during the crash and recover much more rapidly throughout the rest of the year. But while momentum was a boost for many quant investors, it generally wasn’t great enough to overcome the tremendous drag from value, quality, and low volatility strategies if one was pursuing all of the above in tandem. Furthermore, in an unusual turn of events, while momentum applied to stocks was a great success last year, momentum applied to asset classes went nowhere.</p><p>      在今年年初，动量策略被大量投资于高技术股，在股市崩盘期间遭受的冲击较小，并在今年余下时间恢复得更快。但是，尽管动能对于许多量化投资者来说是一个推动力，但如果同时采取上述所有措施，通常还不足以克服价值，质量和低波动性策略带来的巨大阻力。此外，在不寻常的事件转变中，尽管去年施加于股票的动能取得了巨大成功，但施加于资产类别的动量却无济于事。</p><p>  When applied to asset classes, momentum strategies are usually referred to as “trend following” and are often implemented by going both long and short different assets using derivatives like futures, such “managed futures” funds are among the most commonly used hedge fund strategies and have historically delivered stock-market-like returns with little to no correlation to stock or other major asset classes. S&amp;P maintains their own index of what a typical trend following strategy might look like, here’s how it did last year.</p><p>  当应用于资产类别时，动量策略通常被称为“趋势跟随”，并且通常通过使用期货等衍生产品来做多和做空不同资产来实现，这种“托管期货”基金是最常用的对冲基金策略之一，从历史上讲，它提供了类似于股票市场的回报，与股票或其他主要资产类别几乎没有关联。标准普尔维持自己的指数，该指数反映了典型的跟随趋势策略的样子，这就是去年的情况。</p><p>      Trend following strategies generally got out of stocks and into bonds going into March, and so did a great job protecting against the turmoil of that month, but they never managed to capitalize on the upside. Trend followers generally didn’t get back into stocks until July or August, and then were wipsawed back and forth by gyrations in commodity, currency, and fixed income markets.</p><p>      趋势跟踪策略通常从3月开始就从股票中撤出，进入债券市场，在抵御当月动荡的情况下，做得很好，但他们从未设法利用上涨空间。趋势追随者通常要到7月或8月才重新入股，然后被商品，货币和固定收益市场的回旋所左右。</p><p>    These strategies are of course not the only ones that quants employ; entire books can and have been written about all the ways quantitative managers have been able to successfully add value in the markets. Looking at index measures of other commonly used quant strategies the same pattern emerges. A few like event-driven arbitrage did quite well last year, but many more like options writing strategies, relative value, currency carry, and merger arbitrage had low single digit or even negative returns for the year. Not surprisingly, Credit Suisse’s measure of aggregate   hedge fund performance has the entire industry up only 2.49% for 2020 (through November).</p><p>    当然，这些策略并不是量化指标唯一采用的策略。关于量化管理者能够成功地在市场上增加价值的所有方式，可以并且已经撰写了整本书。观察其他常用定量策略的指标测度，就会发现相同的模式。去年，一些类似的事件驱动套利表现不错，但更多的类似期权撰写策略，相对价值，货币套利和并购套利则在这一年中的个位数低或什至是负收益。毫不奇怪，瑞士信贷（Credit Suisse）衡量对冲基金总体表现的结果是，整个行业在2020年（截至11月）仅增长2.49％。</p><p>  To overgeneralize a bit, I might bucket all these different approaches into two main camps. The first are strategies that are about supplying liquidity to and establishing the fair value of securities within the market. The second are strategies meant to “ride the tiger”, to follow the herd wherever they lead, be they attached to reality or not. 2020 was all about the latter; in a year with such awful fundamentals the thing that really worked was lofty aspirations of transformational technological change.</p><p>  为了概括起见，我可能将所有这些不同的方法归纳为两个主要阵营。首先是有关向市场提供证券流动性并确定其公允价值的策略。第二种是旨在“骑虎”，追随它们所追随的人群的策略，无论它们是否依附于现实。 2020年就是关于后者。在具有如此糟糕的基础的一年中，真正起作用的是变革性技术变革的崇高抱负。</p><p>  I pointed out above how lopsided last year’s market was, with nearly half of all stocks losing money despite strong returns for the market overall. Good returns were concentrated into a relatively narrow subset of stocks, and these winners tended to have a lot in common. They were very expensively valued, weakly or unprofitable, highly volatile stocks, mostly in industries associated with rapid technological change. Hype stocks, if you will.</p><p>  我在上面指出了去年市场的不平衡状况，尽管整个市场都有强劲的回报，但近一半的股票都出现了亏损。高回报率集中在相对狭窄的股票中，这些赢家往往有很多共同点。它们的估值非常昂贵，微弱或无利可图，其波动性很大，主要是在与快速技术变革有关的行业中。如果可以的话，炒作股票。 </p><p>  Now, if I told you in the abstract that I have a great investment idea for you, I want you to buy this stock that is trading at an insanely highly valuation so everything has to go right for it to pay off, but fundamentally the company is losing money and in a weak financial position, and the stock is extremely volatile so there’s a much heightened chance of total loss, you might look at me like I’m crazy. Why take a gamble on what seems like such an unlikely bet? Well, often such stocks are in such a state because they have  great story. They are scrappy upstarts that are trying to change the world and wrest market share from the powers that be. They haven’t proven themselves yet but once they do the world will be their oyster.</p><p>现在，如果我抽象地告诉您，我对您有一个很棒的投资主意，我希望您购买这只股票的交易价格高得离谱，所以一切都必须走这条路才能得到回报，但是从根本上讲，这家公司处于亏损状态并且财务状况不佳，股票极度波动，因此出现全盘亏损的可能性大大增加，您可能会像疯了一样看着我。为什么要对似乎如此不可能的赌注进行赌博？好吧，这类股票经常处于这样的状态，因为它们有很好的故事。他们是顽强的暴发户，他们试图改变世界并从现有的力量中夺取市场份额。他们还没有证明自己，但是一旦这样做，世界将成为他们的牡蛎。</p><p>  If we roll back the clock one year and look at which stocks scored the highest in terms of valuation, volatility, and lack of fundamental financial performance a familiar list of names comes up. Just about at the top of the list was the true champion of last year’s market: Tesla, followed closely by names like Netflix, Pelaton, Beyond Meat, Pinterest, Square, and everybody’s favorite new communications platform that they can’t stand anymore: Zoom.* All of these companies beat the market many-fold last year and of course are now even more extremely valued. (An amusing irony of all this is that so many of last year’s most successful companies are in the business of algorithms, whereas algorithmic investors often avoided them and were left behind. Last year was good for tech nerds but bad for finance nerds.)</p><p>  如果我们倒计时一年，看看哪些股票在估值，波动性和缺乏基本财务表现方面得分最高，就会出现一个熟悉的名字列表。排在首位的是去年市场的真正冠军：特斯拉，紧随其后的是Netflix，Pelaton，Beyond Meat，Pinterest，Square等名称，以及每个人都无法忍受的最受欢迎的新通信平台：Zoom 。*所有这些公司去年都在市场上占据了许多席位，现在当然已经变得更有价值了。 （所有这些都具有讽刺意味的是，去年有很多最成功的公司从事算法业务，而算法投资者经常回避它们，而被抛在了后面。去年对科技界人士有利，但对金融界人士不利。）</p><p>  I’m cherry-picking a little bit here of course, but let’s look at what would have happened if you just did the opposite of the “low valuation, high profitability” strategy shown above and picked a portfolio of stocks with the highest quintile of valuation and lowest quintile of profitability and held that for 2020. Again using Ken French’s data through November:</p><p>  当然，我在这里有些挑剔，但让我们看一下如果您仅执行上面显示的“低估值，高盈利能力”策略的相反操作，并选择了投资组合中最高的五分之一的股票组合，将会发生什么情况。估值和盈利能力的最低五分位数，并保持2020年的水平。再次使用Ken French截至11月的数据：</p><p>  The speculative “hype stock” portfolio was up 71.7% through November of last year and beat the “prudent” portfolio by an astounding 91.5%. Adding a screen for higher volatility probably would have improved speculative picks even more. French’s data also shows that the most volatile quintile of stocks earned a 34.4% return over the same period, besting the S&amp;P 500 by about 20%. Numbers like these tend to make believers out of skeptics, especially when they are the culmination of a several year process witnessing the same pattern. In my last posts I argued that valuations have been diverging from fundamentals since about 2014. Let’s see how these opposing portfolios have done since then:</p><p>  到去年11月，投机性“炒作股票”投资组合增长了71.7％，比“谨慎”投资组合高出惊人的91.5％。为更高的波动性增加一个筛选可能会更多地改善投机选择。法国的数据还显示，波动最大的五分之一股票在同一时期的回报率为34.4％，比标准普尔500指数高出约20％。像这样的数字往往使信徒不再持怀疑态度，尤其是当它们是见证了相同模式的数年过程的高潮时。在我的上一篇文章中，我认为，自2014年左右以来，估值一直与基本面背道而驰。让我们看看这些相反的投资组合自那时以来的表现：</p><p>  Wow, hype stocks have been beating quality value stocks for seven years running. Granted, adding a low profitability filter to a high valuation portfolio really only added value in 2020. You would have been better off overall if you’d bought a broader portfolio of just high-priced stocks. Highly profitable value stocks, however, have been underwater for a miserable seven years, even at a time when the market has been up a great deal.</p><p>  哇，炒作股票已经连续七年击败质量价值股票。当然，在高估值投资组合中添加低利润率过滤条件实际上只会在2020年增加价值。如果您只购买高价股票，则购买整体投资组合会更好。然而，即使在市场大幅上涨的时候，高利润价值股票却陷入了惨淡的七年。</p><p>  To most investors, seven years seems like a long time, long enough to look at a graph like this and conclude confidently which is the better strategy. Maybe these traditional financial methods about valuations and cashflows are just outdated in today’s rapidly changing technological landscape? Sure, a lot of these tech stocks seem pretty expensive, but there’s nothing that says they can’t become even more expensive still, right? I explained last time why logically this is actually impossible. Prices cannot deviate from fundamentals forever because eventually there literally isn’t enough money in the world for valuations to rise further. But things can deviate for quite a while before we reach suc</p><p>  对于大多数投资者来说，七年似乎是很长的时间，足够长的时间可以看这样的图表并自信地得出结论，这是更好的策略。在当今瞬息万变的技术环境中，也许有关估值和现金流量的这些传统财务方法已经过时了？当然，这些高科技股票中有很多似乎非常昂贵，但是没有什么可以说它们仍然无法变得更昂贵，对吧？上次我解释了为什么从逻辑上讲这实际上是不可能的。价格不能永远偏离基本面，因为最终世界上确实没有足够的资金来使估值进一步上升。但是在我们成功之前，事情可能会偏离一段时间。</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://rhsfinancial.com/2021/01/11/quantquake-2020-and-the-revenge-against-the-nerds/">https://rhsfinancial.com/2021/01/11/quantquake-2020-and-the-revenge-against-the-nerds/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/2020/">#2020</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/书呆子/">#书呆子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/revenge/">#revenge</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/股票/">#股票</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
