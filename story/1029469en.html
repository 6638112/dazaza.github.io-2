She was looking for a covid-friendly job on craigslist, something to cut down on the student loans she&#39;d have to take out for the year. After searching and scrounging, Sana found someone who needed logistical help taking care of their pets. She applied and was excited to get hired.</p><p>我妹妹萨娜只是想在回大学之前赚点钱。她在Craigslist上寻找一份令人愉悦的工作，这份工作可以减少她今年不得不申请的学生贷款。在搜索和搜寻之后，萨娜找到了一个需要后勤帮助来照顾他们的宠物的人。她申请了，并对被录用感到兴奋。</p><p> First, they needed help buying pet food. They had ordered $1,800 worth of pet food (they bought high quality stuff in bulk apparently) but the seller would only accept payments via Zelle. Her employer was a bit old fashioned and didn&#39;t know how to use that service, so they offered a different arrangement: “I’ll mail you a check for $2,000” they said, “please deposit it in your own bank account, and then use $1,800 of it to Zelle the payment to the sellers. The remaining $200 is your fee.”</p><p>首先，他们需要帮助购买宠物食品。他们订购了价值1800美元的宠物食品(他们显然是批量购买高质量的东西)，但卖家只接受通过Zelle付款。她的雇主有点守旧，不知道如何使用这项服务，所以他们提供了一个不同的安排：“我会给你邮寄一张2000美元的支票，”他们说，“请把支票存入你自己的银行账户，然后用其中的1800美元支付给卖家。”剩下的200美元是你的费用。“。</p><p> Sana was a bit suspicious, but she deposited the check into her Chase bank account and it cleared a few days later. Chase’s site showed that the money had been deposited successfully and was available to use, no strings attached.</p><p>萨娜有点怀疑，但她把支票存入了她的大通银行账户，几天后支票就结清了。大通的网站显示，这笔钱已经成功存入，可以使用，没有任何附加条件。</p><p> Seemed like it was legit. So she did the honest thing and Zelle&#39;d the money  to the seller.</p><p>看起来是合法的。于是她做了一件诚实的事，泽尔把钱交给了卖家。</p><p> Happy with the job well done, her &#34;employer&#34; sent her another $2,000 check to deposit and transfer. This person really liked their pets. The same process happened again, and her employer was happy with the job well done.</p><p>对工作做得很好很满意，她的雇主又给她寄来了2000美元的支票，让她存入和转账。这个人真的很喜欢他们的宠物。同样的过程再次发生，她的雇主对工作做得很好感到高兴。</p><p> Two weeks later, Sana’s debit card stopped working. Confused, she checked her account to see what was wrong.</p><p>两周后，萨娜的借记卡停止工作。困惑的是，她检查了自己的账户，看看出了什么问题。</p><p>    The checks had bounced, two weeks after Chase’s site had indicated they had “cleared”. Before this whole thing had started, Sana had $300 in her bank account. Now she had negative $3,300.</p><p>支票已经退票，两周前，大通的网站曾表示他们已经“清关”。在整件事开始之前，萨娜的银行账户里有300美元。现在她有负的3300美元。</p><p>   Turns out checks can bounce weeks after they&#39;re deposited. It can take that long for the bank to verify they’re legitimate.</p><p>事实证明，支票可以在存入银行数周后退票。银行要花那么长时间才能核实它们的合法性。</p><p>  Your bank sends the check to the check-writer’s bank to request the funds.</p><p>你们银行把支票寄到支票出票人的银行要求资金。</p><p> Their bank verifies if the check is legitimate and the account actually contains the funds. At small or international banks this step is often manual and could take  weeks.</p><p>他们的银行核实支票是否合法，账户中是否确实包含资金。在小型或国际银行，这一步骤通常是手动完成的，可能需要数周时间。</p><p>   It take can than more than  six months for a check to clear, but banks remove that “pending” status just a couple days after it&#39;s deposited and allow people to spend the money. This might sound a bit iffy, but it&#39;s actually a good thing. Most checks are legitimate and people might need the money quickly. But that assumption breaks down with fraudulent checks.</p><p>支票可能需要超过6个月的时间才能兑现，但银行在支票存入几天后就会取消“待决”状态，允许人们消费这笔钱。这听起来可能有点可疑，但它实际上是一件好事。大多数支票都是合法的，人们可能很快就会需要钱。但这一假设被欺诈性支票打破了。</p><p> By removing the “pending” status before fully verifying the check’s legitimacy, Chase gave the illusion that the check had already cleared.  This is what the scammers count on.</p><p>通过在完全验证支票的合法性之前取消“待定”状态，大通银行给人一种支票已经结清的错觉。这就是骗子们指望的。</p><p> Today there is  no way for a Chase customer to be sure that a check has fully cleared. But unless you have the inside scoop on how banks work, or a finely honed sense of when someone is trying to swindle you, you won’t catch it.</p><p>今天，大通银行的客户没有办法确保支票已经完全结清。但除非你有银行运作的内部独家新闻，或者对有人试图诈骗你有一种精心磨练的感觉，否则你不会抓住它。</p><p> When Sana called up Chase, the bank heard her out. But instead of stopping the scammers, their only concern was making sure she pays up the remaining $3,000 that they claimed she owed them.</p><p>当萨娜打电话给蔡斯时，银行听完了她的话。但他们并没有阻止骗子，他们唯一关心的是确保她还清他们声称她欠他们的剩余3000美元。</p><p> Edit: Chase customer support had one clarification to make. I&#39;d originally said it might take, weeks for the check to clear, but the explained it could actually take more than six months. And you&#39;ll have no idea when that magic moment occurs.</p><p>编辑：大通客户支持有一个问题需要澄清。我最初说支票可能需要几周的时间才能结清，但他们解释说，实际上可能需要六个多月的时间。你也不知道那个神奇的时刻是什么时候发生的。</p><p>    My friend David Vargas was caught by  pretty much the exact same scam. He was sent checks which included his fee and payment that was supposed to be made to someone else. And they only accepted Zelle.</p><p>我的朋友大卫·瓦格斯也遭遇了几乎完全相同的骗局。他收到了支票，其中包括他的费用和本应支付给其他人的款项。他们只接受了泽尔。</p><p> In fact, similar  scams  have  been  going on  for years, yet most banks don’t seem to care as long as they&#39;re not the ones losing money.</p><p>事实上，类似的骗局多年来一直在进行，但大多数银行似乎并不在意，只要他们不是赔钱的人。</p><p>   Is Chase bank directly responsible for scamming people? Of course not. Did they create an environment where scammers could thrive? Absolutely.</p><p>大通银行对诈骗人负有直接责任吗？当然不是。他们有没有创造一个诈骗者可以兴旺发达的环境？绝对一点儿没错。</p><p>   What have other companies done when someone abused their products to deliberately cause harm? They took responsibility for it and fixed the problem at a systematic level.</p><p>当有人滥用他们的产品故意造成伤害时，其他公司做了什么？他们为此承担了责任，并在系统的层面上解决了这个问题。</p><p> The Tylenol murders: In 1982, someone started  spiking bottles of Tylenol with poison, killing seven people. This was clearly not Tylenol’s fault, but they still immediately paid to recalled all bottles in the stores, offered anyone who had already purchased the pills free replacements. They took it a step further and  developed tamper-proof packaging to prevent anyone from contaminating the medicine again in the future.</p><p>泰诺谋杀案：1982年，有人开始在瓶装泰诺中加入毒药，造成7人死亡。这显然不是泰诺的错，但他们仍然立即付钱召回了商店里的所有瓶子，向任何已经购买了这些药片的人提供免费更换。他们更进一步，开发了防篡改包装，以防止任何人在未来再次污染这种药物。</p><p> Credit Card fraud services: Online payments are inherently risky. Credit card companies know this, and they’ve committed to helping their customers when the inevitable fraud occurs. If you pay someone with your Discover card and the product turns out to be a scam,  Discover will accept responsibility and refund you the money, taking a loss if necessary. This dynamic keeps Discover on their toes working to prevent scams before they even happen.</p><p>信用卡诈骗服务：在线支付具有固有的风险。信用卡公司知道这一点，他们承诺在不可避免的欺诈发生时帮助客户。如果你用Discover卡向某人付款，而产品被证明是一个骗局，Discover将承担责任，并将钱退还给你，如有必要，将承担损失。这种动态让发现者保持警觉，甚至在诈骗发生之前就阻止了它们的工作。</p><p>  Make the status of the deposited check abundantly clear. This is how Chase can tamper-proof their bottles.</p><p>将存款支票的状态写得非常清楚。这就是蔡斯如何防止他们的瓶子被篡改的方法。</p><p> If a check has been deposited but not fully cleared, if it hasn&#39;t had the actual funds transferred over to the bank, then Chase needs to make that fact clear to customers! This missing piece of UX is what scammers depend on. That’s the systemic flaw here.</p><p>如果支票已经存入，但没有完全结清，如果它还没有将实际资金转移到银行，那么大通银行需要向客户澄清这一事实！这块丢失的UX正是诈骗者所依赖的。这就是这里的系统性缺陷。</p><p> If the bank actually made the status of the funds clear to its customers, then it would have a much stronger leg to stand on when claiming innocence.</p><p>如果银行真的向客户清楚地说明了基金的状况，那么在声称自己是无辜的时候，它就会有更强大的立足之地。</p><p> But as things stand right now, the only way a person could know the check was still at risk is if they already knew about the long clearing time and how banks hide it. Before the results come back from the external bank, Chase itself doesn’t know if the check is valid. Yet they offer customers no hint of that uncertainty.</p><p>但就目前的情况而言，人们知道支票仍有风险的唯一方法是，他们已经知道清算时间很长，以及银行是如何隐藏支票的。在外部银行返回结果之前，大通自己并不知道支票是否有效。然而，它们并没有向客户提供任何关于这种不确定性的暗示。</p><p>    Chase acted like the mafia, shaking down whoever they could to get their money back.</p><p>蔡斯的行为就像黑手党，敲诈任何他们能要回他们的钱的人。</p><p> My sister had created this bank account back when she was in high school. For minors, Chase requires a guarantor, someone who would make sure her debts are paid. My dad had listed himself, he was also a Chase customer.</p><p>我妹妹在高中的时候开了这个银行账户。对于未成年人，大通银行需要一个担保人，一个能确保她的债务得到偿还的人。我爸爸列出了自己的名字，他也是大通银行的客户。</p><p>  He spent hours on the phone with Chase’s customer support trying to get the scam resolved. The reps may have been empathetic, they weren’t empowered to help.</p><p>他花了几个小时与大通的客户支持通电话，试图解决这个骗局。代表们可能有同情心，他们没有权力提供帮助。</p><p> From the bank&#39;s perspective, the money they had already pulled from Sana&#39;s account was theirs. Sorry, no negotiation possible. The computer won&#39;t let us. And Chase did their darned best to not have to take a hair cut on the rest of the amount they enabled scammers to steal.</p><p>从银行的角度来看，他们已经从萨那的账户中取出的钱是他们的。对不起，不可能谈判。电脑不会让我们用的。蔡斯尽了最大努力不让骗子偷到剩下的钱。</p><p> The most those reps could share was to suggest my dad could try not paying the remaining three thousand and wait until the debt goes to collections. And then pray that the collections department has more leniency. It might hurt his credit rating though, they warned. How much? They didn’t know.  The account was scheduled to go to collections at the end of September.</p><p>这些代表所能分享的最多是建议我父亲可以试着不支付剩余的3000美元，等到债务被收回。然后祈祷收藏部有更多的宽大处理。不过，他们警告称，这可能会损害他的信用评级。多少钱？他们不知道。*该账户原定于9月底进入收藏期。</p><p> But a month before that date, my dad noticed his own account was now three thousand dollars lighter. Chase had just helped itself to those funds without warning.</p><p>但是在那个日期的前一个月，我父亲注意到他自己的账户现在少了3000美元。大通银行只是在没有任何警告的情况下帮助了这些基金。</p><p> And now that Chase is no longer losing money on this scam, customer support tells him “Sorry, there’s nothing we can do.”</p><p>现在Chase在这个骗局中不再赔钱，客户支持告诉他“对不起，我们无能为力。”</p><p> With every step Chase made sure it got paid, one way or another. Vito Corleone would be proud.</p><p>每走一步，蔡斯都会以某种方式确保它得到回报。维托·科利昂会为你骄傲的。</p><p>  And if the bank has no skin in the game, why worry about fixing some misleading UI? They seem to think people don’t bother switching banks, and that it can treat its customers as captive users.</p><p>如果银行在这场游戏中没有皮肤，为什么要担心修复一些误导性的用户界面呢？他们似乎认为人们不会费心换银行，而且它可以把客户当作俘虏用户。</p><p>  When a person gets scammed they’re usually hesitant to speak up about it.</p><p>当一个人上当受骗时，他们通常会犹豫是否要直言不讳。</p><p> They&#39;re ashamed of having been duped, afraid of being scorned for their foolishness, and so their story rarely gets told.</p><p>他们为上当而感到羞愧，害怕因为他们的愚蠢而被嘲笑，所以他们的故事很少被讲述。</p><p> Yet I know two people who’ve admitted to being hurt by this scam. What does that imply about the scale of this problem?</p><p>不过，我认识两个人，他们承认自己被这场骗局伤害了。关于这个问题的规模，这意味着什么？</p><p> And Chase allows it to continue happening, punishing their customers for not having intimate knowledge of how banking works.</p><p>而大通银行允许这种情况继续发生，惩罚他们的客户没有深入了解银行的运作方式。</p><p>  I get furious every time I think about it. David Vargas tried to pass his situation off as his own fault, but I was outraged on his behalf.</p><p>每当我想到这件事，我都会勃然大怒。大卫·巴尔加斯试图把他的情况说成是他自己的错，但我代表他感到愤怒。</p><p> I want everyone at Chase to see this story. I want every other bank that’s enabling scammers to see this. And I want them to fix their system to let people know when shady checks have not yet been deposited.</p><p>我想让蔡斯的每个人都看到这个故事。我希望其他所有让骗子看到这一点的银行都能看到这一点。我希望他们修复他们的系统，让人们知道什么时候可疑支票还没有存入。</p><p> When I showed this article to a friend, he got restless, he wanted to take action. “How can I help?” he asked, “Tell me what to do!” At the time I wasn’t sure what could be done, but there is one thing:</p><p>当我把这篇文章拿给一个朋友看时，他变得焦躁不安，他想要采取行动。“我能帮上什么忙吗？”他问道：“告诉我该怎么做！”当时我不确定能做些什么，但有一件事：</p><p> My ask to you: Can you help spread the word and make Chase notice this problem? Maybe the internet outrage machine can turn this into a priority and protect the thousands of other people who are being scammed by this.</p><p>我问你：你能帮忙宣传一下，让蔡斯注意到这个问题吗？也许互联网愤怒机器可以把这件事变成优先事项，并保护数以千计的其他被这件事欺骗的人。</p><p> You could share this article ( retweet the Tweet, or post on FB, Reddit, HN, whatever your usual channels are). Get this shared widely. And maybe, just maybe, some executive at Chase will notice and take the lead in transforming the banking industry. My sincerest thank you to everyone who helps.</p><p>你可以分享这篇文章(转发这条推特，或者在FB，Reddit，HN上发布，不管你通常通过什么渠道)。广泛分享这个。也许，只是也许，大通银行的一些高管会注意到，并带头改变银行业。我最诚挚的感谢每一个帮助我的人。</p><p> So far, Chase hasn’t been interested in accepting an ounce of responsibility for their part in this scheme. Why bother fixing the system when you can just pull money from your customer’s bank accounts? But maybe they can change. Who wants to be known as an unwitting accomplice to scammers?</p><p>到目前为止，大通银行还没有兴趣为他们在这一计划中的一部分承担一盎司的责任。既然可以从客户的银行账户中提取资金，为什么还要费心修复系统呢？但也许他们可以改变。谁愿意在无意中被称为骗子的帮凶？</p><p> And even if they don&#39;t change, remember Chase&#39;s missteps and apply those lessons to your own products. Look for how your problems could be fixed at a systemic level.</p><p>即使它们不会改变，也要记住大通的失误，并将这些教训应用到你自己的产品中。看看如何在系统层面上解决你的问题。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/how-banks-help-scammers-with-their-bad-ui/">https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/how-banks-help-scammers-with-their-bad-ui/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/帮助/">#帮助</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/scammers/">#scammers</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/支票/">#支票</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
