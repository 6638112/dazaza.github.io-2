Life was rich until I tried to quit. This is the story of why I had to pay $300K to unshackle myself.\u00a0  There\u2019s surprisingly little coverage on this topic, maybe because nobody is incentivized to reveal the unsavory truth, or because VCs and founders get a lot more airtime.  Here\u2019s everything I wish I knew before I joined a startup. I hope it can save you from burning piles of money like I did.\u00a0 \u200d\n  For all the talk around \u201cdisruption\u201d, startups exert a surprising inertia over employees.   \u201cGolden handcuffs\u201d is most often used to describe the inertia experienced by big tech employees who make a ton of money and have a hard time leaving. It also applies to startup employees who make a ton of  paper gains and have a hard time coming up with  real money to keep them.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Working at a startup generally requires taking a salary cut. The deal is sweetened with equity \u2014 an ownership stake that can mint millions.   The most common equity vehicle is the stock option. It\u2019s the  option to  buy a certain # of shares at a set price, aka the strike price. That\u2019s right.  You don\u2019t own shares of the company, you own the right to  buy them.    There are two more catches:\n Options usually expire within 90 days of your leaving \u2014 so you have to either pay up or give them up\n If you pay up, you also owe taxes on your  paper gains \u2014 the difference between your strike price and the current valuation\n #2 is dangerous because your taxes grow with the valuation. Even if you have a cheap strike price, your tax burden can be multiples higher. In fact, your total bill can end up costing more than the startup has ever paid you in cash! Yes, it is actually possible to be net negative after devoting years of your life as an employee.   In my case, the price tag for my vested shares was $100K, but the tax bill will be another $200K. That\u2019s a ton of cash just to  keep the shares I worked for, with no guarantees that they will be worth real money.  \u200d\n  The financial defaults are terrible for startup employees, but they don\u2019t need to be this way. You can and should negotiate the fine print, where all the devils lie. Exceptions are never granted unless you ask. Especially true if you are a strong hire and/or the startup really needs to fill the position (which is more common than you think).   First order of business is the exercise window.  Instead of taking the punishing 90 day window, ask for 10 years. You can frame it like this: \u201cI believe in the potential of X and I\u2019m excited to take part in the upside. It\u2019s important that I can do that regardless of my cash position at a specific moment in time.\u201d  Best time to ask is before you sign the offer. This is when you have peak leverage, and if you make it the final sticking point, you\u2019re more likely to get it. To gain an upper hand, try to secure competing offers that have more favorable terms.\u00a0  Does negotiating make you look petty? No, if anything, it shows you\u2019ve done your homework.  Not negotiating terrible terms betrays your naivete \u2014 like me when I signed my offer.  Whatever you settle on, make sure to get it in writing. Many a verbal promise is broken when there\u2019s large sums of money at stake.   If you still wind up with a crazy bill, see if the next company you join is willing to pay your switching cost. I forgot to do this when  negotiating with Instagram, but it can work, especially with bigger companies. The downside is that if you need the new company to bail you out of your old one, you are at their mercy.\u00a0  More points you can negotiate for:\n RSUs instead of stock options: restricted stock units have a strike price of $0, but early-stage startups may not offer this\n Even if you don\u2019t get everything you want, you\u2019ll still develop a better understanding of how accessible your equity  really is. Sometimes a higher salary is better than heaps of \u201clife-changing\u201d stock options you can never afford.  One more escape valve that just came to my attention:  83b election. If you believe in the growth potential of your shares AND you expect to stay and vest, you can choose to pay taxes on your full grant upfront, rather than on your paper gains down the line. This may save you a lot on taxes, but also comes with a dose of downsides:\n You can end up worse off if the shares decline in value OR you don\u2019t fully vest  \u200d\n  As much as startups talk about growing the pie, the finite pool of shares is treated as zero sum. There are only ever 100 points on a cap table. When you give up your options, they go back into the company pool. Your unused options can then be recycled to fund new employee packages.\u00a0\u00a0  Here&#39;s how a VC  sums it up: extending the exercise window prioritizes the well-being of former employees over existing ones. What startup in its right mind would do that?! Probably one that recognizes it was built, brick by brick, from the hands of early employees. Sadly,  91.4% do not recognize this.\u00a0  It\u2019s also hard to decipher the terms in your offer package. If every startup had to walk employees through how the numbers play out, a lot of offers would go unsigned because they\u2019re absurd. Instead, we&#39;re sold on the opportunity to \u201cmake a dent in the universe\u201d.   It\u2019s rarely about the money until the money becomes real.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Most people advised me to give up some shares, or find a third-party to front the cash and split the upside \u2014 both more rational choices than the one I took.\u00a0  In the end, watching years of hard work evaporate in 90 days far exceeded the pain of just paying for the damn lottery ticket. I\u2019m lucky I had access to that cash. Many people don\u2019t. They are forced to give up their shares or stay shackled to a company in hopes of liquidity some day.  I never joined a startup to get rich. But I did naively assume that if all went well, I would ride off into the sunset, having paid for the equity in sweat. I didn\u2019t comb through the fine print because I didn\u2019t know any better.\u00a0  Now you do! Maybe I should rebrand my $300K bill as a premium MBA \u2014 it\u2019s sure taught me a lot, and I hope it brings you a wealth of lessons too.  \u200d\n   I still believe the  right startup offers endless amounts of learning, and a serious shot at earning. But the pot of gold at the end of Unicorn Road is littered with hidden minefields.

I figured it would be a great read but at the same time, it&#39;s a useful exercise for me to see if there are any services we can get rid of or downgrade.\n Just to give you an idea of scale Prezly is an 18 person SaaS product. Fully bootstrapped (no outside capital) and serving about 500 customers globally.\n   If you break that down by the number of staff we&#39;re looking at a cost of 1250 \u20ac/month but this includes the server cost. Excluding server costs, the tooling per staff member (excluding hardware) is around  712  \u20ac/month\n  We&#39;re a software company so obviously, this is the main cost (outside of salaries). These are the minimal infrastructure we need to run the app.\n  Without any of those tools customers would start complaining. Only AWS, Sendgrid, Uploadcare and Algolia are mission-critical.

Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group, Carrier Strike Group One, in response to a massive build-up of Russian naval forces currently operating roughly 300 miles west of Hawaii.\n Multiple U.S. Defense officials speaking on background told\u00a0  The Debrief  that sailors assigned to the Carl Vinson Carrier Group found out at the end of May they would be leaving for an unscheduled deployment within the next 11 days. Reportedly, the carrier group had been previously scheduled to deploy at the end of the summer.\n Officials say the reason for the rapid deployment was large-scale movements by Russian naval forces seen heading towards the vicinity of Hawaii.\n \u201cDeployment cycles are typically very routine, highly coordinated, and scheduled well in advance,\u201d said one current Navy official who was not cleared to speak on the record. \u201cTo pull ahead of a previously scheduled deployment for a classified mission set is extremely rare.\u201d\n So far, the Navy and Department of Defense have not acknowledged the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden quiet deployment. Instead, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Command released an\u00a0  article \u00a0simply announcing the group was currently in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area. Framing its sudden appearance as \u201cintegrated training operations with the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.\u201d\n \u201cOperating in Hawaii provides unique opportunities for Vinson to train jointly while positioned to respond if called,\u201d Commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, said cryptically, while avoiding mention of there being any real-world element to the group\u2019s activities. \u201cThey train to a variety of missions, from long-range strikes to anti-submarine warfare, and can move anywhere on the globe on short notice.\u201d\n   On June 13, Russian state-run media\u00a0  announced \u00a0Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet would be conducting large-scale naval drills in the Pacific Ocean.\n According to Russian news outlet\u00a0  TASS , exercises include all of Russia\u2019s \u201cPrimorye Flotilla\u201d (Pacific Fleet), auxiliary vessels, and up to 20 aircraft, including long-range bombers. \u201cThe drills involve up to 20 surface combatants, submarines, and support vessels,\u201d specified the Russian Defense Ministry.\n CBS News   reports \u00a0that Russian officials call the maneuvers the \u201clargest exercise in the Pacific Ocean since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n On Sunday, June 13, Three F-22 Raptors and a KC-135 refueling tanker were\u00a0  scrambled  from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Initially, Air Force officials only said the scramble was an \u201cirregular patrol\u201d in response to a request by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA released a short message about the incident through Public Affairs spokesperson Ian Gregor, saying only, \u201cThe F.A.A. has a close working relationship with the military.\u201d\n Citing U.S. defense officials, CBS News   reports \u00a0the scrambling of the three stealth fighters and refueling aircraft were in response to Russian bombers that were picked up flying in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. Reportedly, Russian bombers never entered the U.S.\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone, and the F-22s did not intercept the aircraft.\n On May 26, several news outlets\u00a0  revealed \u00a0that a Russian Navy surveillance ship was seen lingering off the western coast of Hawaii. Believed to be the Vishnya-class signals intelligence ship the Kareliya (SSV-535), the spy vessel was reportedly set up 13 miles from the Hawaiian island of Kauai, roughly one nautical mile outside U.S. territorial waters.\n From its vantage point, the Russian spy vessel had a front-row seat to a failed air defense test by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency near Hawaii on May 27. According to reports, a pair of Standard Missile 6 Dual II (SM-6) air defense missiles failed to intercept a simulated ballistic missile attack during the test.\n Popular Mechanics Defense reporter, Kyle Mizokami,\u00a0  theorized \u00a0Russia might have been tipped off about the classified missile tests from Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and Notice to Mariners (NOMAR/HYDROPAC) warning aircraft or ships to avoid the area.\n Conversely, observation of the failed missile test may have been simply a bonus. The Kareliya- which specializes in intercepting and deciphering an adversary\u2019s transmissions \u2013 may have actually been trying to measure the U.S.\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet, which was currently heading towards the area.\n On Tuesday, CBS News   reported  that the U.S.S. Carl Vinson Carrier Group was \u201coperating about 200 miles east of Hawaii, conducting a strike group certification exercise.\u201d According to CBS, the certification exercise had been pre-planned but was moved closer to Hawaii in response to Russia\u2019s presence.\n Multiple defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief\u00a0 that planned exercises or deployment for the Carl Vinson Carrier Group had been previously scheduled for around September. These same officials said that in the last week of May, sailors were notified that plans to go underway had been moved up from months away to less than two weeks.\n   Defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief \u00a0that sailors assigned to Carrier Strike Group One reported to their ships on June 6. Live\u00a0  web cameras \u00a0of San Diego Harbor show the U.S.S. Carl Vinson left port around 10:30 am local time on June 7. Absent from its departure appears to be the usual fanfare. Namely \u201cmanning the rail\u201d or having the crew \u201cat quarters,\u201d with sailors lining up at regular intervals along the weather deck rails in ceremony as the ship enters or leaves port.\n Navy public affairs offices have declined to confirm, deny, or comment on the aircraft carrier group\u2019s deployment so far. After beginning with Naval Air Forces Command on June 10,  The Debrief\u2019s request made it up to 3rd Fleet Command\u2019s public affairs office on June 15.\n Instead of replying to media requests, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Fleet Command released a\u00a0  short article \u00a0and two images saying Carrier Strike Group One had arrived in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area.\n Rather than acknowledging the atypical nature of the carrier group\u2019s arrival near Hawaii, Pacific Fleet Command\u2019s article seemed to be a veiled notice to Russian forces operating nearby that the U.S. Navy was prepared to respond to any aggression towards U.S. interests in the Pacific.\n The Navy mentioned that along with its flagship, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, the entire Carrier Strike Group One, which includes  \u2014 Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, Destroyer Squadron 1, the guided-missile destroyers U.S.S. O\u2019Kane (D.D.G. 77), U.S.S. Howard (D.D.G. 83), U.S.S. Chafee (D.D.G. 90), U.S.S. Dewey (DDG 105) and U.S.S. Michael Murphy (D.D.G. 11  \u2014 was all operating near Hawaii.\n   The Navy also reminded anyone who wasn\u2019t aware or had forgotten, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson is the first aircraft carrier equipped to support F-35C Lightning II and CMV-22B Osprey aircraft. Pointing out, the group also brought with it three U.S. Navy F/A-18 Strike Fighter Squadrons, and EA-18G Growler Electronic Attack Squadron, and E-2D Hawkeye Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron, and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron.\n \u201cWith its recent modifications, no other weapons platform has the responsiveness, endurance, multi-dimensional capacity, inherent battlespace awareness or command and control capabilities of CSG-1,\u201d reads the release by Pacific Fleet Command.\n CSG-1 isn\u2019t the only U.S. naval force that rapidly deployed to the Pacific in early June.\n As part of a training drill dubbed\u00a0  Exercise Agile Dagger , one-third of the Pacific Submarine Force deployed from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on June 3.\u00a0  According \u00a0to the Navy, submarines from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Bremerton, Washington; and San Diego, California; are participating in Exercise Agile Dagger to \u201cdeploy on short notice to demonstrate their readiness, agility, and lethality.\u201d\n There have been evident tensions between the United States and Russia in recent months. Russia has been accused of committing numerous cyber attacks against the U.S., and several months ago, Russia amassed 100,000 troops on the border with Western-allied Ukraine.\n However, there are no indications that any discussions regarding naval maneuvers in the Pacific came up during a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 17.\n In a\u00a0  statement to CBS News , U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson, Captain Mike Kafka said, \u201cU.S. Indo-Pacific Command is monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n Ultimately, why the Navy and DoD are so cagey about the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden deployment or what is going on in the Pacific isn\u2019t entirely clear. It is, however, doubtful that things would ever escalate to the U.S. and Russia coming to blows.\n Nevertheless, with so many American and Russian naval forces currently operating in the vicinity of Hawaii, one defense official told\u00a0  The Debrief , \u201cThings could get pretty tense.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:21:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "John Carter has only an hour to decide. The most important auto race of the season is looming; it will be broadcast live on national television and could bring major prize money. If his team wins, it will get a sponsorship deal and a chance to start making some real profits for a change.\n There\u2019s just one problem. In seven of the past twenty-four races, the engine in the Carter Racing car has blown out. An engine failure live on TV will jeopardize sponsorships\u2014and the driver\u2019s life. But withdrawing has consequences, too. The wasted entry fee means finishing the season in debt, and the team won\u2019t be happy about the missed opportunity for glory. As Burns\u2019s First Law of Racing says, \u201cNobody ever won a race sitting in the pits.\u201d\n  One of the engine mechanics has a hunch about what\u2019s causing the blowouts. He thinks that the engine\u2019s head gasket might be breaking in cooler weather. To help Carter decide what to do, a graph is devised that shows the conditions during each of the blowouts: the outdoor temperature at the time of the race plotted against the number of breaks in the head gasket. The dots are scattered into a sort of crooked smile across a range of temperatures from about fifty-five degrees to seventy-five degrees.\n   The upcoming race is forecast to be especially cold, just forty degrees, well below anything the cars have experienced before. So: race or withdraw?\n This case study, based on real data, and devised by a pair of clever business professors, has been shown to students around the world for more than three decades. Most groups presented with the Carter Racing story look at the scattered dots on the graph and decide that the relationship between temperature and engine failure is inconclusive. Almost everyone chooses to race. Almost no one looks at that chart and asks to see the seventeen missing data points\u2014the data from those races which did not end in engine failure.\n   As soon as those points are added, however, the terrible risk of a cold race becomes clear. Every race in which the engine behaved properly was conducted when the temperature was higher than sixty-five degrees; every single attempt that occurred in temperatures at or below sixty-five degrees resulted in engine failure. Tomorrow\u2019s race would almost certainly end in catastrophe.\n  One more twist: the points on the graph are real but have nothing to do with auto racing. The first graph contains data compiled the evening before the disastrous launch of the space shuttle Challenger, in 1986. As Diane Vaughn relates in her account of the tragedy, \u201cThe Challenger Launch Decision\u201d (1996), the data were presented at an emergency   teleconference, scribbled by hand in a simple table format and hurriedly faxed to the Kennedy Space Center. Some engineers used the chart to argue that the shuttle\u2019s O-rings had malfunctioned in the cold before, and might again. But most of the experts were unconvinced. The chart implicitly defined the scope of relevance\u2014and nobody seems to have asked for additional data points, the ones they couldn\u2019t see. This is why the managers made the tragic decision to go ahead despite the weather. Soon after takeoff, the rubber O-rings leaked, a joint in the solid rocket boosters failed, and the space shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members. A decade later, Edward Tufte, the great maven of data visualization, used the Challenger teleconference as a potent example of the wrong way to display quantitative evidence. The right graph, he pointed out, would have shown the truth at a glance.\n In \u201cA History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication\u201d (Harvard), Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer, a psychologist and a statistician, argue that visual thinking, by revealing what would otherwise remain invisible, has had a profound effect on the way we approach problems. The book begins with what might be the first statistical graph in history, devised by the Dutch cartographer Michael Florent van Langren in the sixteen-twenties. This was well into the Age of Discovery, and Europeans were concerned with the measurement of time, distance, and location. Such measurements were particularly important at sea, where accurate navigation presented a considerable challenge. Mariners had to rely on error-prone charts and faulty compasses; they made celestial observations while standing on the decks of rocking boats, and\u2014if all else failed\u2014threw rope overboard in an attempt to work out how far from the seabed they were. If establishing a north-south position was notoriously difficult, the spin of the Earth made it nearly impossible to accurately calculate a ship\u2019s east-west position.\n In 1628, van Langren wrote a letter to the Spanish court, in an effort to demonstrate the importance of improving the way longitude was calculated (and of giving him the funding to do so). To make his case, he drew a simple one-dimensional graph. On the left, he drew a tick mark, representing the ancient city of Toledo, in Spain. From this point, he drew a single horizontal line on the page, marking across its length twelve historical calculations of the longitudinal distance from Toledo to Rome. The estimates were wildly different, scattered all across the line. There was a cluster of estimates at around twenty degrees, including those made by the great astronomer Tycho Brahe and the pioneering cartographer Gerardus Mercator; others, including the celebrated mathematician Ptolemy, put the distance between the two cities closer to thirty degrees. All the estimates were too large\u2014we now know that the correct distance is sixteen and a half degrees. But the graph was meant to show just how divergent the estimates were. Depending on which one was used, a traveller from Toledo could end up anywhere between sixty miles outside Rome and more than six hundred miles away, on the plains of eastern Bulgaria.\n Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, \u201conly a graph speaks directly to the eyes.\u201d Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them\u2014and the stakes dependent on those differences\u2014became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, \u201cIf the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.\u201d\n  Van Langren\u2019s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study \u201cVisual Explanations\u201d (1997), \u201cMaps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.\u201d Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error\u2014how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.\n The originality of van Langren\u2019s graph attests to a long history of missed opportunities to arrive at the same idea. Friendly and Wainer offer an example from the banks of the Nile, which, before the Aswan Dam was built, in the nineteen-sixties, flooded each year. \u201cEgyptians, who knew that their prosperity depended on the river\u2019s annual overflow, had been keeping the Nile\u2019s high-water mark for more than three millennia,\u201d they write. The records helped farmers track the level of flooding in the recent past and decide when and where to plant crops. But, over thousands of years, nobody realized the significance of the data in aggregate\u2014until the nineteen-fifties, when William Popper used it to chart the Nile\u2019s flood levels in the course of thirteen centuries. Friendly and Wainer write, \u201cNo one thought to make a graph of the high-water level over time or compare the average water level in the last decade to what might occur in the next.\u201d Popper\u2019s work showed, for the first time, the surprisingly wide variation in silting across different periods\u2014and silting was an important factor in fertilizing crops. Fat years and lean years didn\u2019t just happen.\n It was another hundred and fifty years after van Langren\u2019s letter before the next significant advances in visualizing data arrived, courtesy of a 1786 book by the Scottish engineer William Playfair, \u201cThe Commercial and Political Atlas.\u201d Despite the title, it didn\u2019t contain a single conventional geographical map. Instead, it displayed Playfair\u2019s great ability to chart out the shape of an object that existed only in his mind, cementing his place in the history of data graphics: he gave us the line graph of a time series, the bar chart, and, eventually, the pie chart\u2014practically the entire suite of Excel charting options.\n  Playfair explained his approach using a graph that showed the expenditure of the Royal Navy over the preceding decades. Time is on the horizontal x-axis, money is on the vertical y-axis; the line wiggles up and down from left to right. With the advantage of a few centuries\u2019 worth of perspective, it\u2019s hard to believe that this kind of image would be anything other than intuitive to grasp. But Playfair, introducing the time-series graph to the world for the first time, had to work hard to get people to understand what they were seeing. He asked his readers to imagine that he had taken the money spent by the Navy in a single year and laid it out neatly, in guineas, in a straight column on a table. To the right, he would create another column of guineas, to correspond to the amount paid out in the following year. If he continued doing this, creating a column of guineas for each year, \u201cthey would make a shape, the dimensions of which would agree exactly with the amount of the sums.\u201d\n  Where van Langren had abstracted the range of longitudinal estimates into a line, Playfair had gone further. He discovered that you could encode time by its position on the page. This idea may have come naturally to him. Friendly and Wainer describe how, when Playfair was younger, his brother had explained one way to record the daily high temperatures over an extended period: he should imagine a bunch of thermometers in a row and record his temperature readings as if he were tracing the different mercury levels; from there, it was only a small step to let the image of the thermometer fade into the background, use a dot to represent the top of the column of mercury, and line up the dots from left to right on the page. By visualizing time on the x-axis, Playfair had created a tool for making pictures from numbers which offered a portal to a much deeper connection with time and distance. As the industrial age emerged, this proved to be a life-saving insight.\n Back when long-distance travel was provided by horse-drawn stagecoaches, departure timetables were suggestive rather than definitive. Where schedules did exist, they would often be listed alongside caveats, such as \u201cbarring accidents!\u201d or \u201cGod permitting!\u201d Once passenger railways started to open up, in the eighteen-twenties and thirties, train times would be advertised, but, without nationally agreed-on time and time zones, their punctuality fell well shy of modern standards. When George Hudson, the English tycoon known as the Railway King, was confronted with data showing how often his trains ran late, he countered with the data on how often his trains were early, and insisted that, in net terms, his railway ran roughly on time.\n As train travel became increasingly popular, patience was no longer the only casualty of this system: head-on collisions started to occur. With more lines and stations being added, rail operators needed a way to avoid accidents. A big breakthrough came from France, in an elegant new style of graph first demonstrated by the railway engineer Charles Ibry.\n  In a presentation to the French Minister of Public Works in 1847, Ibry displayed a chart that could show simultaneously the locations of all the trains between Paris and Le Havre in a twenty-four-hour period. Like Playfair, Ibry used the horizontal axis to denote the passing of time. Every millimetre across represented two minutes. In the top left corner was a mark to denote the Paris railway station, and then, down the vertical axis, each station was marked out along the route to Le Havre. They were positioned precisely according to distance, with one kilometre in the physical world corresponding to two and a half millimetres on the graph.\n With the axes set up in this way, the trains appeared on the graph as simple diagonal lines, sweeping from left to right as they travelled across distance and time. In the simplest sections of the rail network, with no junctions or crossings or stops, you could choose where to place the diagonal line of each train to insure that there was sufficient spacing around it. Things got complicated, however, if the trains weren\u2019t moving at the same speed. The faster the train, the steeper the line, so a passenger express train crossed quickly from top to bottom, while slower freight trains appeared as thin lines with a far shallower angle. The problem of scheduling became a matter of spacing a series of differently angled lines in a box so that they never unintentionally crossed on the page, and hence never met on the track.\n   These train graphs weren\u2019t meant to be illustrations\u2014they weren\u2019t designed to persuade or to provide conceptual insight. They were created as an instrument for solving the intricate complexities of timetabling, almost akin to a slide rule. Yet they also constituted a map of an abstract conceptual space, a place where, to paraphrase the statistician John Tukey, you were forced to notice what you otherwise wouldn\u2019t see.\n Within a decade, the graphs were being used to create train schedules across the world. Until recently, some transit departments still preferred to work by hand, rather than by computer, using lined paper and a pencil, angling the ruler more sharply to denote faster trains on the line. And contemporary train-planning software relies heavily on these very graphs, essentially unchanged since Ibry\u2019s day. In 2016, a team of data scientists was able to work out that a series of unexplained disruptions on Singapore\u2019s MRT Circle Line were caused by a single rogue train. Onboard, the train appeared to be operating normally, but as it passed other trains in the tunnels it would trigger their emergency brakes. The pattern could not be seen by sorting the data by trains, or by times, or by locations. Only when a version of Ibry\u2019s graph was used did the problem reveal itself.\n Until the nineteenth century, Friendly and Wainer tell us, most modern forms of data graphics\u2014pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts\u2014tended to have a one-dimensional view of their data. Playfair\u2019s line graph of Navy expenditures, for instance, was concerned only with how that one variable changed over time. But, as the nineteenth century progressed, graphs began to break free of their one-dimensional roots. The scatter plot, which some trace back to the English scientist John Herschel, and which Tufte heralds as \u201cthe greatest of all graphical designs,\u201d allowed statistical graphs to take on the form of two continuous variables at once\u2014temperature, or money, or unemployment rates, or wine consumption\u2014whether it had a real-world physical presence or not. Rather than featuring a single line joining single values as they move over time, these graphs could present clouds of points, each plotted according to two variables.\n Their appearance is instantly familiar. As Alberto Cairo puts it in his recent book, \u201cHow Charts Lie,\u201d scatter plots got their name for a reason: \u201cThey are intended to show the relative  scattering of the dots, their dispersion or concentration in different regions of the chart.\u201d Glancing at a scatter allows you to judge whether the data is trending in one direction or another, and to spot if there are clusters of similar dots that are hiding in the numbers.\n A famous example comes from around 1911, when the astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell independently produced a scatter of a series of stars, plotting their luminosity against their color, moving across the spectrum from blue to red. (A star\u2019s color is determined by its surface temperature; its luminosity, or intrinsic brightness, is determined both by its surface temperature and by its size.) The result, as Friendly and Wainer concede, is \u201cnot a graph of great beauty,\u201d but it did revolutionize astrophysics. The scatter plot showed that the stars were distributed not at random but concentrated in groups, huddled together by type. These clusters would prove to be home to the blue and red giants, and also the red and white dwarfs.\n In graphs like these, the distance between any two given dots on the page took on an entirely abstract meaning. It was no longer related to physical proximity; it now meant something more akin to similarity. Closeness within the conceptual space of the graph meant that two stars were alike in their characteristics. A surprising number of stars were, say, reddish and dim, because the red dwarf turned out to be a significant category of star; the way stars in this category clustered on the scatter plot showed that they were conceptually proximate, not that they were physically so.\n But if you could find clusters of dots in two dimensions, why not three? Friendly and Wainer discuss a three-dimensional scatter plot that improved our understanding of Type 2 diabetes. In 1979, two scientists, Gerald\u00a0M. Reaven and R.\u00a0G. Miller, plotted blood-glucose levels against the production of insulin in the pancreas for a series of patients. Along a third axis, they added a metric for how efficiently insulin is used by the body. What emerged was a three-dimensional structure that looks a little like an egg with floppy wings. It allowed Reaven and Miller to split participants into three groups\u2014those with overt diabetes, those with latent diabetes, and those who were unaffected\u2014and to understand how patients might transition from one state to another. Previously it had been thought that overt diabetes was preceded by the latent stage, but the graph showed that the only \u201cpath\u201d from one to the other was through the region occupied by those classified as normal. Because of this and evidence from other studies, they are now considered two separate disease classes.\n  If three dimensions are possible, though, why not four? Or four hundred? Today, much of data science is founded on precisely these high-dimensional spaces. They\u2019re dizzying to contemplate, but the fundamental principles are the same as those of their nineteenth-century scatter-plot predecessors. The axes could be the range of possible answers to a questionnaire on a dating Web site, with individuals floating as dots in a vast high-dimensional space, their positions fixed by the responses they gave when they signed up. In 2012, Chris McKinlay, a grad student in applied mathematics, worked out how to scrape data from OkCupid and used this strategy\u2014hunting for dots in a similar region, in the hope that proximity translated into romantic compatibility. (He says the eighty-eighth time was the charm.) Or the axes could relate to your reaction to a film on a streaming service, or the amount of time you spend looking at a particular post on a social-media site. Or they could relate to something physical, like the DNA in your cells: the genetic analysis used to infer our ancestry looks for variability and clusters within these abstract, conceptual spaces. There are subtle shifts in the codes for proteins sprinkled throughout our DNA; o\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u56fe\u8868,matter,\u706b\u8f66", "title": "\u5f53\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u751f\u6b7b\u6538\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u5019 ", "title_en": "When Graphs Are a Matter of Life and Death", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/when-graphs-are-a-matter-of-life-and-death", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fe\u8868", "matter", "\u706b\u8f66"]}]
