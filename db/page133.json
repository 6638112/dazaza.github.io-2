But the women suing the company have accused it of exploiting them for profit, hosting and promoting graphic videos of rape, revenge porn and even videos that depict child sexual abuse.\n  Isabella said more than 200,000 people ultimately watched the video \u2014 &#34;including everybody at my college, pretty much,&#34; she said.\n &#34;The view count on the video will forever haunt my dreams,&#34; she said. &#34;Just knowing that that many people saw it really messed me up.&#34;\n After learning how many people had seen her video on Pornhub, she said she battled with a sense of shame and worthlessness and had to transfer schools. She couldn&#39;t look in a mirror for six months and drew into isolation, she said, fearful that people at her new school would recognize her.\n And she struggled with the feeling that she&#39;d brought this on herself. &#34;It&#39;s taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I am a victim of something,&#34; she said.\n   The lawsuit alleges that Pornhub&#39;s business model is built around funneling online traffic to videos like Isabella&#39;s.\n  MindGeek owns and operates more than 100 pornographic websites, and its brands include Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn and Xtube. MindGeek also owns porn production companies that create content, but for years, a majority of the content on Pornhub was uploaded by unverified users. MindGeek operates some paid-subscription sites, but Pornhub is free for anyone to access and earns money through advertising revenue and optional, premium subscriptions.\n Isabella said she decided to join the lawsuit to protect other victims. A draft of the lawsuit says MindGeek &#34;embraced under-age, non-consensual, and pirated content in its business&#34; and claims the company &#34;profited from content produced through human trafficking.&#34;\n Michael Bowe, the lawyer representing the women, said the company has skirted rules that have long been in place to protect actors in the &#34;traditional&#34; porn industry, which requires producers to verify the age and identities of the people featured in videos.\n &#34;The online porn industry has essentially been the Red Light District of commerce,&#34; Bowe said. &#34;This new industry of online porn, for the last 10 years, has been allowed by law enforcement, government entities, to operate by a different set of rules. Basically, no rules or oversight.&#34;\n Bowe has spent the past year building a civil case against the company based on racketeering laws normally used to go after mobsters and drug gangs.\n Last December, after a wave of backlash over nonconsensual content on the platform, Mastercard and Visa blocked card users from making purchases on Pornhub. Under scrutiny, MindGeek announced an overhaul of its procedures and took down millions of videos uploaded by unverified users, deleting 80% of the content on its site.\n  MindGeek executives also announced last year that they had removed the ability for users to download videos and added a requirement that people posting videos verify their identification.\n   &#34;We are committed to eradicating illegal content,&#34; the company said in a statement to CBS News, adding that earlier this year, the company enacted &#34;the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history.&#34;\n The statement said, &#34;We have banned uploads from unverified users, eliminated downloads, expanded our moderation processes, and partnered with dozens of non-profit organizations around the world, steps that surpass those of any other major platform on the internet.&#34;\n In a statement Thursday after the lawsuit was filed, MindGeek said the allegations in the complaint that Pornhub is a &#34;criminal enterprise&#34; are &#34;utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false.&#34;\n During a February hearing before the Canadian House of Commons, MindGeek&#39;s CEO Feras Antoon decried online child abuse imagery. &#34;Sexual material, child abuse material has no place on our platform. It makes us lose money,&#34; he said. &#34;It completely ruins the brand that we have been trying to build for over a decade.&#34;\n But the company still does not require its users to verify the identity or age of those featured in its videos, something that&#39;s standard in the traditional porn industry. The company also doesn&#39;t seek to confirm the consent of everyone who appears in videos posted to the site, a measure that victims of abuse believe would help keep nonconsensual content off porn sites.\n Some of the victims in the lawsuit told CBS News they joined after they discovered their non-consensual videos on Pornhub and reached out to an activist named Laila Mickelwait. In 2020, Mickelwait founded a campaign called Traffickinghub which started a petition to &#34;Shut Down Pornhub.&#34; She told CBS News it now has more than 2 million signatures.\n  During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in March, Mickelwait called Pornhub a &#34;mega-sex trafficker,&#34; and said the site was infested with non-consensual pornographic content. &#34;The company knowingly has enabled and profited from mass amounts of sex acts induced by force, fraud or coercion, and the commercial sexual abuse of children,&#34; she said.\n   Traffickinghub says it&#39;s &#34;powered by&#34; a religious organization called Exodus Cry, which has been criticized for its efforts to criminalize parts the sex industry and abolish pornography altogether. On its website, Exodus Cry advocates for laws to &#34;end the sex industry&#34; and &#34;reduce the demand for commercial sex.&#34;\n Pornhub&#39;s executives have said the company was designed to celebrate freedom of expression and empower adults. And in its statement Thursday, the company claims Bowe is a &#34;soldier of the ultra-right wing effort to shut down the adult content industry.&#34;\n But Bowe said his goal isn&#39;t to ban online pornography, but rather, to force it to comply with regulations.\n He told CBS News: &#34;This case is not about porn, it&#39;s about rape. This is a legitimate industry that consenting people have every right to participate in. It just needs to be done legally and not with illegal content.&#34;\n Of the 34 women suing the company, 14 said they were underage in videos uploaded to PornHub, and 14 were victims of people charged or convicted of sex crimes.\n  One of those victims is Aubrey, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity. She says her ex-husband secretly recorded a video of them having sex, then uploaded it to Pornhub without her consent or her knowledge. The ex-husband now faces criminal charges of forcible rape, domestic assault and non-consensual dissemination of private sexual images by posting the video on Pornhub.\n Aubrey learned about the video from a friend in 2018, after she said it had garnered more than 400,000 views.\n   &#34;I will never, ever be able to recover the emotional pain that this has caused me,&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;It truly, truly was a living nightmare. I \u2014 I didn&#39;t \u2014 everybody had seen everything about me. And that&#39;s just \u2014 that&#39;s a very private moment. And it&#39;s a very vulnerable moment. And it&#39;s just \u2014 it&#39;s hard to come to terms with. That the world has seen that.&#34;\n Aubrey said she struggled to convince Pornhub to remove her video. Emails reviewed by CBS News show that after she contacted the company to tell them the video was not taken consensually, a Pornhub representative challenged her.\n He asked, &#34;Are you the female in the video? How do you know this is you?&#34;\n Aubrey responded, &#34;I know this is me by several things. That is my bed, I have a mole on my right hip, that is my face, my voice, THAT IS ME and I am pissed.&#34;\n After a three-day exchange, Pornhub took down the video, but even then, Aubrey said she found it posted to other porn websites \u2014 renamed and re-uploaded, by users she didn&#39;t know.\n She said she felt defeated to know that the video was still online. &#34;I felt like everything was taken away from me. And I had no power. I had no say in it. I was completely powerless,&#34; she said.\n One former executive, who worked at MindGeek before the company overhauled its policies, provided information included in the lawsuit against MindGeek. He said that illegal content was seen as &#34;good&#34; for business. He agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. He fears retribution.\n   He said the company favored keeping more content on the site. &#34;I mean, if you offer everything on the site, there is something for everyone,&#34; he said. &#34;The more you have, the better it is. So for all the free sites like Pornhub, more content is always better.&#34;\n He said when content was flagged on PornHub, MindGeek often moved it to one of the dozens of other porn sites it owned. &#34;Removed content popped up on all their other sites and no one really cared,&#34; he said.\n In its statement to CBS News, MindGeek said: &#34;The spread of illegal content is an existential threat to the internet, and every platform has the moral obligation to join the fight against it. Illegal material on the internet harms its victims, internet users and all platforms that operate online. Any suggestion that the company tolerates or celebrates this material is patently false.&#34;\n   One victim, Michelle, who is using a pseudonym, said that she was targeted at age 15 by an abuser who has since been convicted of blackmailing children to sexually abuse themselves on camera.\n She said he coerced her to take sexual photos and videos, which he later sold as &#34;box sets&#34; to other offenders. Some of those videos were uploaded to Pornhub, and from there, she said, they spread.\n She said that the videos&#39; uploads on Pornhub had &#34;way, way worse&#34; of an impact on her than even her blackmailer&#39;s initial abuse. &#34;It was only when my videos went on sites like Pornhub that my life started to become something that I couldn&#39;t live out properly,&#34; she said, adding that she stopped eating, leaving the house and once attempted suicide.\n Michelle reported the videos to Pornhub during the fall of 2018 and continued flagging content for the site to take down throughout 2019. And although Pornhub took down all unverified content last year, Michele said she continues to find images of her abuse re-uploaded on other websites. She said, &#34;Any other place I find my videos there&#39;s some type of mention of Pornhub or where they originated from, and my name was always with them.&#34;\n   Strangers continue to contact her about her videos, she said, and one man even showed up at her house, telling her that he&#39;d found her through Pornhub.\n The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which investigates reports of child sexual abuse, told CBS News that MindGeek began reporting suspected child abuse to their Cyber Tipline in April 2020, and throughout 2020, reported more than 13,000 instances of child sexual abuse imagery. In its statement, MindGeek said those reports represent approximately 4,000 unique incidents.\n &#34;According to leading advocates, non-profits and third-party analyses, Pornhub&#39;s safeguards and technologies have proven effective,&#34; the statement said, adding that according to  the center&#39;s data, one major social media platform was responsible for more than 20 million reports.\n Despite that, the center said that victims and survivors who contact them &#34;express frustration&#34; with MindGeek&#39;s record in removing sexually abusive content, noting their expectations for MindGeek to take greater steps to proactively identify and remove the content from its site.\n The center added that it receives information from the public about suspected child sexual abuse imagery on MindGeek sites &#34;on a daily basis.&#34;\n  Another victim, Ashley, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity, said in August of last year, she learned that Pornhub was hosting a video of her being assaulted while unconscious.\n She said her then-husband drugged and raped her, and had posted the assault on Pornhub. The video was tagged &#34;sleeping pills,&#34; and she says it had been on the site for three years and racked up tens of thousands of views before she learned of its existence.\n   Her abuser was arrested last week on charges of sexual assault, distributing intimate images without consent and indecent exposure. She said his arrest came as a relief, but she hopes MindGeek will be held responsible too.\n Ashley said the changes the company made to their site last year, which require users to upload a government-issued ID in order to post content, may not have prevented a situation like hers.\n &#34;Of course you have consent from the person uploading the video. They&#39;re the one uploading it,&#34; she said. &#34;But it&#39;s the people in the video that really need to be asked.&#34;\n Even after Pornhub deactivated the original video of her rape, she said the thumbnail image of the video, which shows her unconscious and naked, continues to populate in Google image search results to this day.\n She said, &#34;There shouldn&#39;t be anywhere safer in the world than at home in your own bed, right? And you shouldn&#39;t be able to go to bed one night and wake up on Pornhub.&#34;\n The new lawsuit asks a federal court in California to order MindGeek to pay damages to the victims, an amount Bowe told CBS News that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Victims who spoke with CBS News also hope the company will someday be held criminally responsible.\n &#34;How would they like it if it was someone they loved? Their child? Their sister?&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;They&#39;ve got to take steps to prevent this from ever happening to anybody ever again.&#34;\n   In its statement, MindGeek said: &#34;Anyone who attempts to post nonconsensual imagery or child sexual abuse material on the internet is a criminal, and we are committed to remaining at the forefront of the internet when it comes to the elimination of illegal content. Every online platform has the responsibility to join this fight, and it requires collective action and constant vigilance. We hope other platforms will use our model to help eradicate unwanted content.&#34;\n Jessica Kegu, Sara Cook, Martin Finn and Jennie Kamin contributed to this report.

", "note_en": "We have a special blog today from one of our own design engineers, Simon Martin. He\u2019s the designer of Raspberry Pi 400 and our High Quality Camera and spends his free time tinkering with electronic music.\n  Simon has wanted to make his own electronic musical instrument with Raspberry Pi for some time. He designed a circuit board for the project a year ago, but it lay around in a drawer in his desk while he finished  Raspberry Pi 400. Finally, the winter months gave him the incentive to get it working.\n  Simon: The Synth6581 device doesn\u2019t look much like an electronic musical instrument, but just like circuit boards stacked on top of a  Raspberry Pi 4. You have to plug a musical keyboard into a USB port and a pair of speakers into the audio jack on the bottom board to make it work.\n  The code is written almost entirely in Python, with a little bit of C to speed up the communications to the chips. I designed and laid out the circuit boards, which were ordered online. The first six boards cost only \u00a320, but the components were another \u00a3100. I spent more than a day soldering the components on the boards by hand. It took much more time to check every chip and connection worked, a common problem with hand-soldering new boards.\n   And Synth6581 is no ordinary sounding musical instrument. It\u2019s based on the music chip inside a vintage computer: the Commodore 64.\u00a0The microchips are almost forty years old and they have a quirky sound that kids in the 1980s loved and parents hated.\u00a0By the way, did you know that the Commodore 64 was the inspiration for Raspberry Pi 400?\n   I was one of many hobby programmers in the 1980s that used to attempt to program Commodore 64s. Much like people today dabble with programming on Raspberry Pi 400s, kids and adults were dabbling with the BASIC programming language on their Commodore 64s back then.\u00a0Nowadays, Raspberry Pis have video, graphics, and audio readily available, but back in the 1980s, the hardware registers had to be \u2018poked\u2019 one by one into the console window. You had to get quite technical just to get the computer to make a musical sound. Those sounds came from the MOS6581 or \u2018SID\u2019 chip. It had such a famous sound character that it formed the basis of the chiptune music genre, and people are still writing music on Commodore 64s today.\n   By borrowing a few chips from broken Commodore 64s, including one or two lying around Raspberry Pi Towers, I made those 1980s ping noises into a polyphonic synthesiser controlled in Python on Raspberry Pi. The registers in the SID chips are simply being \u2018poked\u2019 by Raspberry Pi instead of Commodore 64. I also reverse-engineered the music from old games and made the sound effects and instruments work across the keyboard.\n   This device is unique: only one of these will ever be built, so please don\u2019t wait for a launch date. There were over 10 million chips manufactured for Commodore 64, but production of the chips ended nearly 30 years ago. The Commodore 64s and spare parts for them are still in high demand, which is pushing up second hand prices. Nonetheless, the code and schematics are available online  on GitHub, and I invite other Raspberry Pi users to use them to make musical instruments out of other games consoles. I reckon Sega Megadrive has a lot of potential for a Raspberry Pi port\u2026", "posttime": "2021-06-18 17:32:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "raspberry-pi,pi,\u8986\u76c6\u5b50", "title": "Commodore 64\u548cRaspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581 ", "title_en": "Commodore 64 and Raspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/commodore-64-raspberry-pi-4-synth6581/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pi", "\u8986\u76c6\u5b50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066670, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u6211\u5750\u5728\u6211\u7684\u706b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9760\u7740\u7a97\u6237\u7565\u5fae\u6253\u5f00\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u5c4f\u5e55\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u4fdd\u6301\u5b83\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5173\u95ed\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u4f55\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u7a0d\u5fae\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6211\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5230\u5ba4\u5185\u3002\n \u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u7684\uff0c\u81ed\u5473\u7684\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u82cd\u8747\u662fAbuzz\u3002\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u9633\u53f0\u4e0a\u5f88\u96be\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u9080\u8bf7\u6240\u6709\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u8fdb\u5165\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u788e\u5c51\u7684\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u3002\n \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u601d\u8003\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\u91cc\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\uff1f\u5f53\u4f60\u6ca1\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u65f6\uff0c\u5468\u65e5\u4e0b\u5348\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u9664\u975e\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u82cd\u8747\uff09\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6b64\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u822a\u5176\u5783\u573e\u5145\u586b\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\uff0cI\uff06\uff0339;

As there are no screens, I wanted to keep it as closed as possible to keep out any bugs. However, I needed to keep it somewhat open so that I&#39;d be able to get back indoors.\n As it was a hot, smelly day in New York City, the flies were abuzz. I found it hard to relax on my illegal balcony knowing that I was basically inviting all of the flies into my apartment for an all-you-can-eat buffet of human detritus.\n This got me thinking how effective the partially closed window is at keeping out the flies. What does the function of flies in my apartment over time look like? The perfect question for a Sunday afternoon when you have no friends (unless you count the flies).\n  In order to run this simulation, we need a model of how a fly navigates its trash-filled world. As a first pass, I&#39;ll model a fly as moving in a random direction with a random speed for each timestep of the simulation. Pretty simple, but flies do appear to be relatively simple creatures.\n If we take a look at the trajectory of a single fly using this model, it does indeed look random:\n  Now let&#39;s simulate a bunch of flies. To do this, first we initialize an array  xs to hold the position of the flies. We&#39;ll normally distributed this in a  2*WORLDHEIGHT x WORLDHEIGHT square. We&#39;ll also initialize all the flies to be outside (setting the window to be at  x = 0 and indoors to be  x &gt; 0).\n xs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  *  np . array ([[ WORLDHEIGHT  *  2 ,  WORLDHEIGHT ]]) xs [( xs [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 ), 0 ]  *=  - 1 xs [( xs [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  *=  - 1\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  xps  =  xs  +  vs  *  dt  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  inoutmask  =  ( np . sign ( xps [:, 0 ])  *  np . sign ( xs [:, 0 ]))  ==  - 1  m  =  ( xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 1 ])  /  ( xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 0 ]  +  1e-7 )  b  =  xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  m  *  xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  invalidmask  =  b  &gt;  WINDOWHEIGHT  idxs  =  np . where ( inoutmask )[ 0 ][ invalidmask ]  xps [ idxs , 0 ]  =  1e-4  *  np . sign ( xs [ idxs , 0 ])  xps [ idxs , 1 ]  =  b [ invalidmask ]  # 3. Bound the flies.  xps [( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT ), 0 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [(( xps [:, 1 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT )  &amp;  ( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 )), 1 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [( xps [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  =  0  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  xs  =  xps  vs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  vs  =  ( vs  /  np . sqrt (( vs  **  2 ). sum ( 1 )[:, np . newaxis ]))  *  maxv  return  ( xs ,  vs )\n Step 2 might require a little explaining. Every timestep, each fly travels in a line from its previous position to its new position. We only want the flies to be able to travel through the crack at the bottom, so we need a way to ensure they can&#39;t travel through the glass.\n To do that, we first find all of the flies that changed indoor/outdoor state this timestep ( inoutmask). This can be done by comparing the sign of the previous and current  x since the window is at  x = 0. We can then calculate where the fly crossed the line  x = 0 using some middle school math.\n It should be impossible for the fly&#39;s y-intercept to be greater than the height of the window crack, we for thos flies ( invalidmask), we set their y to be where they tried to cross the window and their x to be some small epsilon on the side that they came from. I don&#39;t just set it to 0 because then the fly would not get picked up by  inoutmask and may be able to travel through the glass on the next iteration.\n Step 3 just makes sure that the fly does not go through the arbitrary walls of the world. Currently, only the floor and the walls of my apartment are defined so a fly can escape to infinity in the -x or +y directions while outdoors. Here&#39;s a diagram of the world for the visually-inclined:\n ---------------- y = h | | | | | | | _________________________________| x = -h x = 0 x = h\n OK, we can finally see the flies fly! Because of the random velocity vectors, they unsurprisingly look quite jittery:\n    This is great and all but the flies don&#39;t look too realistic. Let&#39;s make their velocity vectors vary smoothly so that they don&#39;t look like a dubstep light show.\n To do this, we&#39;ll pick a random angle in the range  [-pi/8, pi/8] to rotate each fly&#39;s velocity vector by. In this simulation, we won&#39;t vary the magnitude of their velocities at all.\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  ...  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  ...  # 2.5. Flip the x-velocity of the invalid flies.  vs [ idxs , 0 ]  *=  - 1  # 3. Bound the flies.  ...  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  8.  Cs ,  Ss  =  np . cos ( dthetas ),  np . sin ( dthetas )  Rs  =  np . array ([[ Cs ,  - Ss ],  [ Ss ,  Cs ]]). transpose ( 2 ,  0 ,  1 )  vs  =  ( Rs  *  vs . reshape ( NFLIES ,  2 ,  1 )). sum ( axis = 1 )\n While not necessary, Step 2.5 was added so that the flies don&#39;t take get stuck keep trying to go through the window as their velocity rotates slowly.\n In Step 4, instead of choosing new random values for  vs, we create a random rotation matrix for each fly and rotate their initial velocities by it.\n If we take a look at the animation now, we can see the flies look slightly more realistic (if not still a bit spazzy):\n   While the flies now obey the laws of aviation, there&#39;s still something that seems missing. Normally, flies  want to get indoors. They  need to get indoors. So to simulate this, I added an attractor (maybe a rotting piece of fruit) at a position  A indoors to lure the flies.\n To do this, I added one variable to the fly&#39;s state: a scalar value  a which represents how close they are to the delicious piece of fruit. The fly will be able to remember the most recent value of  a so that it can know whether it&#39;s getting warmer or colder.\n  def  attraction ( x ,  A ):  return  1.  /  ( 1e-7  +  np . sqrt ((( x  -  A . reshape ( 1 ,  2 ))  **  2 ). sum ( 1 ))) def  update ( xs ,  vs ,  ats ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  ...  ats  =  attraction ( xs ,  A )  atps  =  attraction ( xps ,  A )  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  16.  wrongmask  =  atps  &lt;  ats  dthetas [ wrongmask ]  +=  np . random . randn ( wrongmask . sum ())  *  np . pi  /  8.  ...  return  ( xs ,  vs ,  ats )\n  If the attraction increased from the previous timestep, keep going in the same direction (do nothing)\n We add another random rotation in the range of  [-pi/16, pi/16] just to keep things interesting.\n The fly will keep going in a straight line (with some random jitter) as long as the attraction it sense is increasing. If it senses that it&#39;s going in the wrong direction, it will more aggressively explore its neighborhood until it finds a good direction to head in.\n As you can see by the new trajectory, this seems to work fairly well for simulating a stupid but well-motivated fly:\n  However, it seems on the aggregate, the flies just swarm the attractor. Thankfully this isn&#39;t the case in real life as I currently only have two flies in my apartment.\n   With this information in hand, I finally wanted to answer the popular game show question: &#34;How many flies are in my apartment?&#34;\n The first experiment I ran was to plot the average number of flies given how open the window was over a few max velocities. Here is the result for the random flies:\n  Quite nicely, it turns out that as the window, gets more open, the number of flies indoors increases linearly.\n For the smooth flies, we see a less linear function. I&#39;m not quite sure why.\n  The attracted flies produce an even more asymptotic (is that a word?) plot. My hypothesis is that this is because the flies are more likely to find their way to the trash than in other models so it doesn&#39;t help them as much when the window is more open.\n  Then I wanted to see how long the simulation ran for affected the number of flies. We see similar results for the random and smooth flies. With faster moving flies (the orange and green plots), random moving or in the smooth case randomly initialized flies are more likely to barrel off towards infinity when outside. Therefore, the total number of flies decreases as the simulation progresses.\n  In the case of the attracted flies, we again see that a higher max velocity results in the number of flies peaking earlier. However, because the flies have some knowledge as to what direction to go in, they tend not to drift out into the ether and the population eventually plateaus.\n   Thanks for joining me on this pointless exerise and in case you missed it the answer to the titular question is two.

", "note_en": "When a Russian scientist identified the Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple, harvests in Kazakhstan\u2019s forests were bountiful; now this wild fruit is threatened.\n        Winter\u2019s cool indifference had already embraced the snow-tipped peaks of the Tian Shan mountain system, winds whispering the tall trees into a state of undress.\n \u201cIt is cold,\u201d said Alexey Raspopov, a guide with  Trekking Club Kazakhstan, pointing to the dashboard thermometer of his 4x4 as we ascended, leaving Kazakhstan\u2019s second city Almaty to disappear beneath a layer of smog.\n One could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple\n After driving for about two hours to the Turgen Gorge, we abandoned the vehicle and continued on foot. The climb was not difficult, but biting gusts threatened to take the feeling from my fingertips and steal the words from my lips as I asked Raspopov, who has led hikes in the region for the past 30 years, about the landscape that unfolded before us.\n \u201cIt has changed a lot,\u201d he said, calling upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the thickening pollution and a shrinking glacier to illustrate his point \u2013 not that he needed to. The near disappearance of the forests of  Malus sieversii, or wild apple, that once blanketed the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau section of the Tian Shan mountains (which also stretches to Kyrgyzstan), are testament enough to the changing times.\n   When storied Russian scientist Nikolai Vavilov first identified the  Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple,  Malus domestica, in 1929, the region\u2019s forests were thick and their harvests bountiful.\n \u201cAll around the city one could see a vast expanse of wild apples covering the foothills,\u201d wrote Vavilov of his visit to Almaty, then Kazakhstan\u2019s capital. \u201cOne could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple.\u201d\n Vavilov based these words on his idea that the \u2018centres of origin\u2019 of a species lie in the places where you find its highest genetic diversity. His observations that all domestic apples may originate from Almaty has since been confirmed by modern genetics.\n \u201cAt some point, either seeds, trees or budwood from desirable trees was taken out of the [ Malus sieversii] forests by humans and grown elsewhere,\u201d said Gayle Volk, a research plant physiologist at the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). \u201cIn some cases, those trees could have hybridised with wild apple species growing in other regions. The selection process continued.\u201d\n  Silk Road trade is believed to have scattered the fruit far and wide, eventually reaching North America with European colonists.\n Despite being the first to scientifically assert Almaty\u2019s association with the apple, Vavilov was not the first to observe fruit\u2019s influence on the region. \u201cAlmaty used to be called Alma-Ata [the Russian name for the city],\u201d Raspopov told me at the apogee of our ascent. \u201cIt means \u2018father of apples\u2019,\u201d he added, before handing me an acid-green fruit the size of a child\u2019s fist.\n Zesty, sweet and deliciously crisp, it was not plucked from one of the nearly naked branches in front of us, which, when in season, bear apples of all shapes, sizes, flavours and textures \u2013 and, as Raspopov warned me, are rarely edible. Instead, this apple was a triumph of farming and cultivation, sadly the very same human endeavours that have ravaged the wild apple\u2019s natural habitats. This thought did not stop me from accepting another though, listening as Raspopov continued: \u201cKazakh people, Almaty people, they are very proud of the apple. It comes from here.\u201d\n  That pride is worn plainly for all to see throughout the city. Billboards bearing images of apples and Almaty\u2019s tagline, \u2018the city of [a] thousand colours\u2019, advertise nothing else but the famous fruit, injecting bold pops of red along otherwise grey highways. At the  A Kasteyev State Museum of Arts, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest art museum, apples appear in oil paintings and metal sculptures. On a larger and more public scale, murals depicting the fruit adorn the sides of buildings, and a giant granite apple-shaped fountain is a point of attraction at Kok Tobe mountain, one of the city\u2019s major landmarks. On my way to the cable car that takes visitors to its peak, I waited patiently in line to take a picture of a sunshine-yellow, Soviet-era car, stuffed full of plastic apples; the licence plate read \u2018I love Almaty\u2019.\n In the city\u2019s Green Bazaar, a farmers\u2019 market thronging with locals wrapped up against the chill, precarious towers of apples fastidiously organised according to hue, size and shape beckoned. Slices were deftly cut and devoured, offered with a steady stream of Russian \u2013 the lingua franca here \u2013 and gratefully received with a grin and a quiet \u201c spasiba\u201d (Russian for \u2018thank you\u2019, and about the sum of my knowledge of the language).\n  Just as the  Malus sieversii is the progenitor of modern apples, the Green Bazaar is ground zero for Kazakh cuisine. Each aisle presents another ingredient or element fundamental to the country\u2019s culinary history. There is the corner dedicated to horsemeat, from an animal so sacrosanct to the once-nomadic Kazakh people that it is considered a delicacy. Then there are countless Korean specialities, emblematic of the diaspora that led many Koreans to settle in Central Asia after being forcibly deported from Soviet Russia by Stalin in 1937, where they had fled following the breakdown of the Chosun dynasty in 1910. And there are pickles of almost every type imaginable, garnished with generous amounts of dill.\n Everything needed to make some of the country\u2019s signature dishes can be found here. Take  plov, a Central Asian rice dish that each country has adapted slightly. In Kazakhstan, the twist comes in the form of apples, which are added to the customary lamb, carrots and onions for a bit of additional sweetness.\n  But while the region has gladly accepted the  Malus domestica as its own, Kazakhstan\u2019s wild apples have been decidedly neglected.\n Malus sieversii is currently listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the  ICUN Red List (last assessed in 2007), with its population \u2018decreasing\u2019. Threats to the few remaining forests include residential and commercial development, livestock farming and deforestation. Moves have recently been made to preserve those that remain in the Trans-Ili Alatau foothills by Italy\u2019s  Slow Food foundation (which requires permits for visitors to enter the forest) with funding from  Cultures of Resistance Network.\n \u201cAgain and again, Slow Food has demonstrated that slowing down and paying attention to what we eat is not just a matter of the lifestyle choices of the affluent,\u201d said Iara Lee, director of Cultures of Resistance Network. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting models of agroecology that provide alternatives to environmentally destructive corporate farming, where profit becomes the driving concern. We need alternative models now more than ever.\u201d\n  Whether Vavilov foresaw such destructive human activity when he first visited Almaty is impossible to imagine. However, the visionary scientist made certain to collect  Malus sieversii seeds to protect the species and help prevent any future famine. He added them to his collection of 250,000 seeds, fruits and roots at one of  the world\u2019s first gene banks in Leningrad (now St Petersburg).\n During the  Siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1944, several botanists who worked at the gene bank chose to starve to death rather than eat the seeds stored there. Vavilov also died of starvation, imprisoned in the  gulag for falling out of favour with those in power. Thankfully, though, his legacy survives to this day. Now named the  Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (VIR), the gene bank is the only facility of its kind in Russia.\n \u201cWe collect, evaluate, maintain and use the collection according to Vavilov\u2019s theories and approaches,\u201d said Igor Loskutov, the head of the institute\u2019s rye, barley and oats genetic resources department. \u201cWe are working to prevent the loss of genetic diversity and genetic erosion. The VIR is important not only for Russia, but for the whole of mankind.\u201d\n Volk agreed: \u201cThe wild species in their native habitats will always be important, however, gene banks increase accessibility to the wild species and can serve as a partial backup in case of unexpected circumstances,\u201d she said.\n  In the case of Almaty\u2019s wild apple forests, let\u2019s hope those unexpected circumstances never arise.\n Back in the birthplace of the modern apple, the work of Vavilov, along with his courageous colleagues and his contemporaries, is a footnote in the story of a city whose identity is entwined with the fruit. To celebrate their work, and to satisfy a sudden craving, I stepped into a street-side stall and bought a mottled green-and-red apple. It was delicious.\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the car filled with apples as a Volga.

This is, obviously, utter horseshit; we assemble our political selves either from wanting to embrace a particular social group (all the cool 1 people on Twitter pretend they\u2019re part of the Combahee River Collective so I will too) or to reject one (my parents are annoying limousine liberals so I\u2019ll be a college Republican). We then backfill in a set of political opinions from there. There\u2019s a lot of consequences for this, few of them positive. A big one is what I call the Selfish Fallacy, which is neither an apt nor clever name but I can\u2019t think of anything better.\n The Selfish Fallacy is where you\u2019ve adopted a political view or set of views out of the previously-mentioned social necessity (or, increasingly, professional survival) but aspects of that view are unpalatable to you for various reasons, so you define the view in a way that is unusual or internally inconsistent or otherwise engineered to avoid conflicting with your other views, social world, or prior commitments. You then act as though that motivated definition is the plain truth about the view or set of views. For example, due to  my   Harper\u2019s  piece I have fairly regularly interacted with people who champion  the Nation of Islam as a revolutionary Black power organization. But in fact, as I write in the linked piece, the NOI is first and foremost a bizarre religious cult defined by social conservatism and a truly deranged mythology which has had remarkably little political impact despite its prominence and, at one time, resources. Those people weren\u2019t lying when they represented the NOI the way they did. They genuinely believed that the Nation was some radical liberation organization, rather than a means for Elijah Muhammad to amass money and get access to pliable young women, because doing so helped reconcile various clashing beliefs. The were subject to the Selfish Fallacy, in other words.\n In less explicitly political terms, many people lay claim to the idea of \u201creal Montessori,\u201d which they think encompasses what Maria Montessori really believed was essential to her pedagogy. But all Montessori educators and schools avoid some of the dictates of her book, such as the physical education routines or her strange prohibition against children eating green foods. When you discuss these deviations with passionate Montessori people, their tendency is to express ignorance of that aspect of the philosophy, dispute that it\u2019s in the book at all, or otherwise avoid confronting the deviation. The point is not that there is a dispute about what Montessori\u2019s beliefs were. Rather the point is that, where Montessori\u2019s actual beliefs might conflict with those of the people who claim her legacy, understanding of the philosophy is vague, internally inconsistent, or avoided. The Selfish Fallacy is selfish because ideas and philosophies and traditions are defined in a way that suits the interests of the person espousing them; it\u2019s a fallacy because it prompts arguments that depend on a motivated misrepresentation of the debated ideas.\n Here\u2019s an important point about the Selfish Fallacy: it\u2019s not a matter of accepting some aspects of a philosophy and not others, or wanting to develop a better idea that resolves problems within it. \u201cI admire some elements of the Nation of Islam, but there are parts that need to go\u201d is a perfectly fair position. Instead, the Selfish Fallacy is a convenient ignorance or misunderstanding, a motivated thoughtlessness; it handles conflicts not through potentially-painful reconciliation but through avoidance. \u201cI think there are important insights within critical race theory, but its rejection of the legitimacy of basic democratic rights isn\u2019t helpful,\u201d is not the Selfish Fallacy. \u201cCRT just says we should teach children that slavery is bad and racism still exists\u201d is the Selfish Fallacy because it\u2019s a convenient ignorance that allows the people saying it (and people do say stuff like that) to fulfill the social mandate to support CRT without prompting any cognitive dissonance.\n This tendency towards avoidance is why you observe the Selfish Fallacy most often in relation to the beliefs or behaviors of a specific organization one would like to maintain positive feelings towards (as when people who believe in supporting Black businesses lionize the Black Panthers, an explicitly Marxist organization), when claiming to be working in the legacy of an individual because of the rhetorical power of that claim (such as those who invoke Adam Smith while ignoring  basic elements of his philosophy), or when the debate is deeply concerned with definitions and the boundaries of a given school of thought, as with the critical race theory controversy.\n Indeed the debate about critical race theory is filled with the Selfish Fallacy. CRT is now a completely  floating signifier thanks to the motivated reasoning of those who defend it. Conventional center-left liberals feel compelled to defend CRT because conservatives attack it, but some aspects of that academic field are sufficiently extreme to make advocacy for them unpalatable, so the definition of CRT simply morphs to fit their boundaries for legitimate opinion. For many or most of the people defending critical race theory today, the tradition is just a vague assertion of the prevalence of racism, dressed up in a little academic jargon - because this conception is far more convenient for them than grappling with what CRT actually is.\n Which is funny because these liberal defenders act like they alone know what critical race theory really means. A lot of liberals suddenly find themselves not just defending CRT and pretending that they have read deeply in the field but also pretending that they  always have known what it means. (This stems from one of the most deeply-ingrained aspects of progressive culture,  the addiction to knowingness - the imperative to not only have an opinion on everything but to act like you have always had this opinion because everything is obvious and banal to you.) You can study people\u2019s records on social media or in their written work and find that they never referenced critical race theory before it became an important social signifier in liberal spaces, but that\u2019s easily waved away. In any event, it has become a cultural and professional imperative that good liberals embrace CRT, so they have embraced it.\n But as Yglesias points out here, a big part of CRT involves a skepticism towards, or an out-and-out rejection of, some  elementary aspects of liberal society. This is part of a broader academic left tendency; certainly when I was in academia in the humanities a half-decade ago it was considered terribly embarrassing to believe in individual rights and the Enlightenment etc. But a lot of ordinary everyday progressives still embrace that tradition. Rather than let their social need to defend CRT conflict with that attachment, they simply invent an imaginary CRT in their heads so there\u2019s no conflict. And this is the Selfish Fallacy.\n People are going to the mattresses for a fairly obscure set of theories from legal education that they didn\u2019t know existed last year, and so there are bound to be people passionately advocating for CRT on Twitter when many of its precepts would be very challenging to their broader politics. People want to believe that their political culture is normal and the other side is crazy, so they sand away the edges of the philosophies they\u2019re espousing. But there genuinely is some wild-ass shit in CRT stuff and the broader \u201cantiracism\u201d movement, such as the idea that  math is racist. Because it\u2019s 2021 and culture war reigns in all things, liberals who defend CRT don\u2019t want to accept that such wild shit exists. So they go on Twitter and express performative outrage at conservative ignorance about CRT while remaining entirely ignorant of what CRT is themselves in order to avoid having the nasty feeling of being pretty much conventional center-left Dems who suddenly believe, for example, that free speech is not just undesirable but has always been  a tool for maintaining white supremacy. (Warning: link contains actual critical race theory, though like much of CRT, written by a white guy.)\n This is a problem for the contemporary left and the Democratic party more broadly: recent outbursts of social justice politics have brought normies to the point of expressing aspects of extremist philosophies that they simply are not in a position to really embrace. The radical Black critique of contemporary American society really is radical! For example, it is extremely common within the broad realm of critical race theory  to argue that all white people inherently promote white supremacy, regardless of intentions. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually radical in substance - generalizing an accusation to that degree inevitably defangs it to the point of meaninglessness - but it is certainly a challenge to a widespread assumption that your individual racial attitudes matter in moral and political terms. But now respectability in mainstream liberal circles requires elaborate and showy deference to anything that labels itself a part of the Black social justice movement, even while those respectable mainstream liberals continue to maintain a generally bloodless approach to politics where the most radical things on offer are, like, tweaking the Earned Income Tax Credit. This combination of deference to certain kinds of radical ideas with an existentially milquetoast party is, obviously, not sustainable. The way it played out last year was that the radicalism in substance was dropped while the radical posturing endured. We didn\u2019t Defund the Police, but we did spend a lot of political capital convincing people that the Democrat were anti-cop. This does not seem ideal for anyone.\n Jeet Heer is emblematic of a sea of liberal cope on this issue. I\u2019ve been digging around his tweets on CRT and it\u2019s a mess. He simultaneously wants to argue that a) conservative critics of CRT don\u2019t know anything about CRT and are attacking it completely cynically, and b) that most defenders of CRT aren\u2019t defending the anti-liberal attitudes summarized in the passage Yglesias highlighted, which he dismisses as a \u201cfairly esoteric scholarly body of thought.\u201d Hey Jeet, buddy: critical race theory itself is a fairly esoteric scholarly body of thought. It\u2019s an approach to legal education first, and one that was until very recently not very popular even among legal educators. It has seen an explosion of interest in the past year because the kind of soggy liberals who teach at law schools have decided that they need to look busy when it comes to race or risk losing their cush gigs. The question is, should we take it seriously for what it actually is, that particular brand of scholastic \u201cantiracism,\u201d with all of its extremity, insularity, and academic baggage? Or do we just use \u201ccritical race theory\u201d to mean a vague approach to understanding race that emphasizes the symbolic, cultural, and linguistic to the detriment of the material, and which is defined primarily by relentless pessimism dressed up as radicalism?\n The problem with the latter option is that it renders a farce of one of the most commonly-voiced liberal complaints about this debate, which is that conservatives don\u2019t know anything about what they\u2019re critiquing. To acknowledge that the actual substance of CRT is a \u201cfairly esoteric scholarly body of thought,\u201d rather than the free-form social signifier for \u201cpeople who are Good About Race\u201d disarms that critique. It reveals it for the utter hypocrisy that it\u2019s always been. Yes, conservatives don\u2019t know shit about CRT and attack it for cynical reasons, but most of the liberals defending CRT don\u2019t know shit about it either and are defending it for reasons of pure culture war and social signaling. When I made this point earlier this week I was accused of \u201cfalse equivalence,\u201d but I\u2019m not saying that critics and defenders of CRT are the same. The conservatives are full of shit and utterly hypocritical about freedom of speech and exchange of ideas and local control of schools and more. Banning CRT in schools is asinine, for no other reason than that K-12 students aren\u2019t exactly in a rush to uncritically accept what\u2019s they\u2019re taught in the first place. But on the specific question of people arguing about CRT without having read any of it, well - the idea that the average BlueAnon Twitter account raging about conservative attacks on CRT is doing so from an educated place is so absurd I can\u2019t imagine anybody would defend it.\n In 6 months the CRT debate will be over and nobody will talk about it and we\u2019ll be on to a new bullshit \u201cconversation about race\u201d that never admits to the fact that our supposed racial reckoning has  accomplished nothing. Because the very purpose of all of this culture war is to distract from that failure. But the bigger problem for the mainstream left-of-center will remain: they\u2019ve painted themselves into a corner of having to be seen uncritically accepting the positions of Black critics of contemporary society even when those positions cut directly against their own actual beliefs and what they know to be in their political best interest. The Democratic intelligentsia must appear to accept Black radicalism even while their base rejects it and they know that there are electoral advantages to distancing themselves from it. ( Ask Eric Adams.) This situation can\u2019t last, and when it comes to a head, it might get ugly. And for those radical Black critics the story might be bleaker still: the fact that the Democratic party so effortlessly incorporates their rhetoric suggests that it\u2019s far less challenging than they might like to think. Jeet Heer, for one, thinks all that radical stuff can be dismissed out of hand, and this is where Black radicalism stands among liberals today.\n If you think that we must maintain this strange performative deference to Black radicalism because of the events of last year, I would gently suggest that we try giving them results instead of deference.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 16:49:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8c2c\u8bef,selfish,warning", "title": "\u81ea\u79c1\u7684\u8c2c\u8bef ", "title_en": "The Selfish Fallacy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-selfish-fallacy", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8c2c\u8bef", "selfish", "warning"]}]
