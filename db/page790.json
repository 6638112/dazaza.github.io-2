"note_en": "When I ask another developer who their favorite internet API company I usually get a one word response:\n      It\u2019s wild how passionate people get about just  rails. When I say rails, think rails on a train track. They serve as a utility for trains to travel on. You can consider Stripe the rails of commerce and the internet.  Stripe provides the rails to the internet that enable a large portion of online commerce and transacting. But still, at the end of the day it\u2019s just an API.\n Stripe\u2019s mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. And they\u2019ve done just that over that last decade. They\u2019ve reached 96% of US adults. And they complete 250M API requests per day. That\u2019s over 91B requests per year that they fulfill through their API.\n So what\u2019s made them such a successful company when their functionality is matched by numerous other companies who can either beat them on rate or functionality?\n      Early on, Patrick would take customer success to the next level. He would go to customers\u2019 houses to install Stripe. Obsessing over the user experience has become core to the company ever since.\n   This philosophy comes through in the Stripe dashboard. A button that reads \u201cFeedback about this page?\u201d stands prominently in the top right corner of every page of the dashboard.\n Constantly improving the UX for customers is a never-ending goal of theirs. That\u2019s what it means to be customer obsessed. If you ever settle, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n They even take it a step further. You can expect their employees who don\u2019t even work on product to ask you how they can improve it and where you\u2019ve experienced issues.\n   Making developers feel special is key to Stripe\u2019s success. When a developer gets to work with Stripe, it feels magical.\n  But their response wasn\u2019t just building something that \u201cjust worked\u201d. They built something that solved the problems they themselves had as developers. They fixed the things with that kept them up at night.\n Then they kept improving. They talked to customers constantly. They found their problems. They   empathized with the developers who were the ones building things with their product.\n The act of empathy in developing a developer focused product is severely undervalued. The software engineers that are building their company\u2019s software have opinions. More likely than not those opinions on the tech they use are religious. And developer religion is sacred. By focusing on creating the best developer experience possible, Stripe has earned the love, praise and promotion of developers all over the world. Stripe doesn\u2019t need to force their product down anyone\u2019s throat because they create a delightful experience in a sector that leaves people banging their heads against the wall.\n But is it really worth it to invest so heavily in product and developer experience?\n Stripe was built to arm the rebels. They reduce the cost to start accepting payments securely to zero. Previously, businesses needed to invest heavily in building a compliant payment system that can take payments on their site. Not only is it expensive, but it\u2019s also risky to do so and take on the liability of processing payments. With Stripe, you can process millions with a 30 minute integration from a remote cabin in the mountains.   Anyone, anywhere can rebel against the system with Stripe.\n What comes around goes around. Stripe has spread good karma to developers by giving them an amazing experience and making them happy. In return, developers are promoters. They rep the brand and promote it where they can.  They fanboy over the slightest feature release and push for adoption wherever they can. Not surprisingly, they push to work with it at their jobs too.  That\u2019s bottom up adoption at it\u2019s best.\n   Stripe obsesses over creating a seamless customer experience. Small annoyances in applications compound. Sure, a user might not churn immediately because you have a bunch of unoptimized functionality or crappy UX, but it\u2019s a recipe to create a grumpy user. And grumpy users aren\u2019t always loyal users.\n Over the years, Stripe has taken developers\u2019 grumpy feedback and made it their mission to make developers smile when using their platform.\n   Not only that, but Stripe has also managed to stay away from the enterprise jargon that makes developers and rebels alike cringe.\n  It\u2019s sexy, accurate and true to Stripe. A true developer first brand staying loyal to their values.\n   Stripe doesn\u2019t just value utility - they value the beauty in providing the utility. When you land on the Stripe home page you\u2019re greeted with a design that inspires. Its beauty and attention to detail makes you want to build a better future. It makes you aspire to be like Stripe (the evidence is in the thousand startups that rip off their design yearly - as they say, mimicry is the best form of flattery).\n I\u2019m no design expert, but I can safely say that when you compare the following, one makes you want to do something with your day, and the other makes you want to take a nap.\n   Like I said, it\u2019s the small things. Braintree works. It functions.   But it doesn\u2019t inspire.\n Stripe has built a developer brand that\u2019s helped propel them to success by embracing the little things and leaning into them. The effort in their aesthetic and interaction design doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n When Stripe dropped their latest design upgrade, developer and design twitter went nuts. Everyone was talking about it for a couple days.\n   When people are buzzing about just a new site design, you know you\u2019ve done something right. This is what happens when you invest heavily into the small things that go a long way for your audience. Stripe knows their customers are developers and developers tend to be obsessed with details. So Stripe makes sure all the details and small things(like the homepage) are delightful.\n  If you\u2019re building a developer first company - or a product that aims to empower developers to build something, you need to be obsessive about the developers who are going to build on top of you.\n    If you can do that, then the rest will come. Having a passionate developer audience behind your product will have compounding returns. They\u2019ll build on top of your platform. They\u2019ll promote it to others. And they\u2019ll obsess over the product.\n Suffice to say, obsessing over your customers/developers will pay dividends. It\u2019s somewhat imperative to obsess over them if you want to build a strong developer first product/company. Stripe may be the developer obsessive company on everyone\u2019s mind right now, but be certain others have taken notice. There\u2019s a new wave of companies coming who are developer obsessed and design driven.", "posttime": "2020-07-21 11:02:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "We have created a new architected material, which is both highly deformable and ultra\u2010resistant to dynamic point loads. The bio-inspired metallic cellular structure (with an internal grid of large ceramic segments) is non-cuttable by an angle grinder and a power drill,\u00a0and it has only 15% steel density. Our architecture derives its extreme hardness from the local resonance between the embedded ceramics in a flexible cellular matrix and the attacking tool, which produces high-frequency vibrations at the interface. The incomplete consolidation of the ceramic grains during the manufacturing also promoted fragmentation of the ceramic\u00a0spheres into micron-size particulate matter, which provided an abrasive interface with increasing resistance at higher loading rates. The contrast between the ceramic segments and cellular material was also effective against a waterjet cutter because the convex geometry of the ceramic spheres widened the waterjet and reduced its velocity by two orders of magnitude. Shifting the design paradigm from static resistance to dynamic interactions between the material phases and the applied load could inspire novel, metamorphic materials with pre-programmed mechanisms across different length scales.\n     Nature uses hierarchical structures for protection from extreme loads. The freefall of grapefruit from 10\u2009m does not damage the pulp  1 because pomelo peel consists of vascular bundles and an open-pored cellular structure with the struts made of parenchymatic cells. Arapaimas fish living in the Amazon resist the attack of piranhas\u2019 triangular teeth arrays through the hierarchical design of their scales  2. The highly mineralized external layer of each scale has sinusoidal grooves, with a periodicity that is out-of-phase with that of piranha teeth spacing. The external interface is strengthened by an underlying hierarchical structure consisting of a cross-lamellar arrangement of collagen fibers. Biological shells also owe their hardness to hierarchical structures  3, which evolved over hundreds of millions of years. Nacre of Abalon is made of hard aragonite tiles with an organic, flexible interlayer. Its fracture toughness is 3000 times higher than that of single aragonite crystals  4. Gao  et al.  5, 6 proposed a one-dimensional model to study the interplay between high volume fraction of mineral tiles and flexible protein layers. Metals, which require processing temperatures in excess of 300\u2009\u00b0 C are largely absent in biological structures; i.e., nature has only been able to create materials and architectures prone to transformations at earthbound environmental conditions.\n Multi-scale material manufacturing technologies have benefited from recent developments such as self-propagating photopolymer waveguides to achieve unprecedented properties  7. Pham  et al.  8 translated the known benefits of dislocations (local imperfections) in metals into 3D printed, polymeric lattices with unit cells at millimeter scale. Their work demonstrated that one needs to consider the system level interactions and that focusing only on a repetitive unit cell may be self-limiting. Shape-reconfigurable materials (SRMs) were developed to allow for significant morphological changes upon application of relatively small loads and the maintenance of the desired shape when the loading was removed  9. Novel architectures were proposed to convert the energy of the incoming mechanical waves into a local resonance. Embodiments of that concept range from the atomistic scale  10, through 3D printed structures  11 up to infrastructure level, such as seismic metabarriers  12. Topology optimization algorithms have produced material patterns capable of focusing, turning or dispersion of blast waves  13. Our recent work has shown that locally self-impacting structures can excite natural frequencies of the material to interfere with the oscillatory loads and consequently minimize vibrations  14, 15.\n Our study created a new metallic-ceramic, hierarchical structure (Fig.\u00a0 1), which is susceptible to internal vibrations under localized loads. These oscillations are designed to occur when a rotating cutting tool encounters a ceramic sphere on its path. The contact with the ceramic segment produces a localized load on the rim of a rotating disc, which leads to high-frequency, out-of-plane vibrations  16. The second aspect of the resistance mechanism was inspired by the vision of Francis Bacon  17, who wrote \u2018this Proteus of Matter, being held by the Sleeves, will turn and change into many Metamorphoses.\u2019 He believed that matter could not be destroyed or annihilated but only reshaped, reformed or transformed into a new geometry, state, or composition. Thus, we did not attempt to prevent fragmentation of the ceramic segments through the use of the hardest available material (i.e. with the highest purity). Conversely, we employed alumina spheres with suboptimal densification of the grains to promote the fragmentation into fine particulate matter because particles are useful for abrasion of the cutting disc. Notably clusters of small particles become more resistant to penetration under fast moving load due to the increase of their system level resistance under high strain rates  18. In other words, our design did not attempt to prevent the material transformations but embraced them and selected the base materials to achieve the most favorable evolution of the constituents.\n Hierarchical structure of the proposed metallic-ceramic meta-material. ( a) Sandwich panel sample (245\u2009mm \u00d7 172\u2009mm \u00d7 40\u2009mm), ( b) ceramic spheres are organized in lines, ( c) cylindrical specimens (60\u2009mm diameter \u00d7 150\u2009mm) had a vertical organization of ceramic spheres, ( d) cross-section of the cylinder with colors corresponding to the wall thickness of cellular aluminum, ( e) ceramic spheres are not in contact with one another but are separated by aluminum cells, ( f) foam cells are an order of magnitude smaller than ceramic spheres, ( g) thickness of aluminum cell walls varied mostly from 0.2 to 0.4\u2009mm.\n We produced sandwich plate specimens made of a cellular aluminum core (EN AW-6060) with an orthogonal layout of ceramic spheres (Fig.\u00a0 1a,b,e,f) with steel alloy (DC01) faceplates. The ceramic spheres had 13\u2009mm mean diameter, while aluminum foam had on average 2.1\u2009mm pore size only and the wall thickness ranging from 30\u2009\u00b5m to about 1000\u2009\u00b5m. Thus, the ceramic inclusions were an order of magnitude larger than ceramic particulate matter or whiskers used for reinforcement of metallic foams. The ceramic spheres were sufficiently large to interact with a drill or a cutting blade and occupied only 14% volume fraction of the cellular core.\n The aluminum foam matrix had a density of  \u03c1  f\u2009=\u2009730\u2009 kg/ m 3 and 73% porosity (air content), which ensured sufficient flexibility of the matrix. Our metallic-ceramic hierarchical structure had  \u03c1  f\u2009=\u20091140\u2009 kg/ m 3 density. Sandwich panels with two 2\u2009mm steel face plates had 1780\u2009 kg/ m 3 density in a 40\u2009mm thick panel configuration. We also manufactured cylindrical specimens to demonstrate that our technology can achieve high aspect ratio components such as beams or columns (Fig.\u00a0 1c,d,g and CT scans in Supplementary Information). The cylinders were ideal for computed tomography (CT) because the X-ray travel path through the foam was equal around the circumference, which reduced measuring artifacts. See Methods, section 7 for the description of our CT setup.\n  Our material consists of metallic and ceramic ingredients and consequently requires metallurgical processes to manufacture the end parts. Firstly, the aluminum powder is mixed with titanium dihydride, TiH 2 (foaming agent) utilizing a rotating impeller to ensure a uniform mixture (Fig.\u00a0 2). After the mixing stage, the powder mixture is consolidated via cold compaction in a compressor and then extruded through an extrusion die resulting in dense rods of material, which are cut into smaller pieces. Next, ceramic spheres and compressed aluminum powder rods are stacked in an orthogonal, grillage pattern and enclosed in a steel box using spot welds. The structure is then heated in a furnace to ca. 760\u2009\u00b0C (depending on the melting range of the used aluminum alloy) for between 15 and 20\u2009minutes. The titanium dihydride begins to decompose at approximately 470\u2009\u00b0C, releasing hydrogen gas. The release of the high-pressure hydrogen expands the molten aluminum, creating voids. The components are subsequently cooled in calm air to produce a stable cellular structure with embedded ceramic components.\n Manufacturing steps include mixing metal powder with small amount of foaming agent. It is followed by pressing the mix and extrusion into preform shapes. The compressed powder bars enable precise placement of ceramic segments in the orthogonal pattern and manufacturing of the end product in an industrial furnace.\n  We subjected cylindrical samples (60\u2009mm diameter \u00d7 150\u2009mm height) to compressive loading in order to characterize mechanical properties of our meta-material (Fig.\u00a0 3). The Young\u2019s modulus, from loading-unloading tests, was  E = 5.5  GPa and yield stress,  \u03c3  y = 8.1  MPa (measured according to ISO/DIS 13314 standard). The Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material was approximately 0.0 in the early stages of the loading and began ascending toward 0.5 from 10% engineering strain onward (see Methods, section 1). The cellular structure showed significant deformability, exceeding 20% of engineering strain as expected from previous studies of cellular metals  19, 20, 21, 22, 23 with the densification strain of  \u03b5  d \u2248 0.25. The inclusion of ceramic spheres did not have a significant effect under static loading because the deformations followed the paths of the least resistance via the cellular matrix in-between the spheres.\n Compressive testing of cylindrical samples. ( a) quasi-static compressive test of a cylindrical sample, ( b) metallic foam with ceramic spheres showed distinct plateau and the ability for compressive deformation up to 25%.\n  Relatively low plateau stress (compared to solid steel) and ability for large compressive deformations is excellent for energy dissipation under extreme loads. However, protective systems usually also require hardness to withstand point loads. Ballistic resistance is often achieved with ceramic materials such as high-purity alumina ( Al 2 O 3) or high-hardness, armor steels. The multiplicity of the hardness measuring instruments with various indenter shapes and test protocols  24 indicate that hardness may not be a fundamental property of a material but rather a composite one including yield strength, work hardening, true tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and micro properties such as strength of atomic bonds. We were not aiming in our study at low depths of Brinell, Rockwell or Knoop indentations but at resistance to penetration under real-life extreme loads. We concentrated on developing resistance to the severe localized loads such as an angle grinder, power drill, and water jet cutter, which are examples of extreme loads. Focusing on these specific, end-user features allowed us to depart from the established paradigm of designing for the high hardness, i.e. low indentation resistance.\n The angle grinder attack represented the first highly localized load applied to penetrate our architected material. We used 115- and 125-mm diameter cutting discs with a sapphire finish to cut our panel samples (see Fig.\u00a0 4 and Methods section 2 for disc descriptions). The angle grinder revolved at up to 180 revolutions per second, with rim velocity of up to 80\u2009m/s. The angle grinder achieved only a partial incision and subsequently experienced high wear. Its external diameter reduced rapidly from 115\u2009mm to 44\u2009mm (Marcrist disc) and from 125\u2009mm to 100\u2009mm (Tyrolit disc) after 60\u201365\u2009sec. At that point, the cutting discs became ineffective (Fig.\u00a0 4b and Movie\u00a0 S1). Exact cutting attack times for the performed tests are tabulated in Methods, section 2. To compare our results with existing armor materials, we also tested one of the best currently available rolled-homogeneous armor (RHA) steels, distributed under MARS 220 trademark. The steel is quenched and tempered at temperatures below 200\u2009\u00b0C to give it 440 Brinell hardness. The angle grinder completely penetrated the 10\u2009mm MARS 220 plate in 45\u2009sec (see Methods section 2 and Movie\u00a0 S2).\n No complete penetration was achieved in any of our cutting tests. In the same time, excessive wear of the discs, ( a,b) Marcrist and ( c) Tyrolit occurred within one minute of the cutting attacks and rendered angle grinders ineffective.\n The resistance mechanism of our architected material exploited the contrast in stiffness between the ceramic spheres and the flexible aluminum cellular structure. Thereby, the energy of the rotating angle grinder was partially transferred into the mechanical vibrations of the spinning disc (Fig.\u00a0 5) and subsequently into vibrations of the ceramic sphere (nested in the flexible cellular matrix), which interacted with the cutting disc (Fig.\u00a0 5b,c). The tool operator reported vibrations, and they are also evident in Movie\u00a0 1. Computed tomography scans also detected cracks in the aluminum foam structure (Fig.\u00a0 5c,e, Supplementary Information A and Movies\u00a0 3\u2013 5). The working principle of the vibrational interface is shown schematically in Fig.\u00a0 5b. Localized contact of the rotating disc with the ceramic sphere (blue) generated broadband vibrations. Such behavior is consistent with previous work by Campbell  16, who measured multiple vibrational modes, including four nodal waves, after application of a rubbing contact to a rim of a rotating disc.\n Resistance mechanism to angle grinder cutting. ( a) cylindrical sample for CT study, ( b) ceramic sphere applied point load to the rim of the rotating disc, inducing vibrations and dynamic interface, ( c) CT image (color-coded) showing the interaction between the partially cut sphere and the rotating disc, ( d) rotating disc cut the sphere partially and then the cutting ceased to progress, ( e) low purity employed alumina ensured sphere fragmentation into particles in the range of 50\u2013500\u2009\u00b5m, ( f) ceramic sphere applied localized load to the tip of the rotating disc resulting in disc vibrations.\n Dynamic vibrations had not been effective when the disc only touched the external surface of the ceramic sphere because the contact area on the sides of the cutting disc was insufficient to excite considerable disc oscillations. However, as the cutting progressed, it increased the contact region with the disc\u2019s rim (Fig.\u00a0 5f). Consequently, lateral disc vibrations were generated, which created a dynamic interface with the partially cut ceramic sphere. In addition to the case where the cutting discs were applied to the equator of the sphere, we also tested cases, where the angle grinder cut on the side of a sphere, in the proximity of the equator and closer to the sphere\u2019s pole (see SI with CT scans of these cases and Movies\u00a0 6\u2013 9). We observed the same outcome, i.e., the cutting disc diameter reduced rapidly in just over a minute, and the angle grinder became inoperative. Interestingly, the vibrational mechanism was equally effective against the power drill, where the geometry of the drill bits differed significantly from the flat, cutting discs of angle grinders. In all instances when a drill encountered a ceramic sphere, the drilling progress was arrested (see Movie\u00a0 10). Hence, the vibrational interface mechanism did not appear sensitive to the aspect ratio of the rotating cutting tools. The experimental procedure and detailed results of cutting and drilling tests are explained in Methods, section 2. The CT-scans of these tests are included in Supplementary Information C.\n Theoretical modes of vibrations  25, 26 consist of shape variations along the angular direction, with waveform denoted by  n (see Fig.\u00a0 6). The first angular wave corresponds to a single sinusoidal wave along the circumference of the disc denoted with  n = 1. For  n = 2 deflections form a train of two waves, for  n = 3 a train of three waves and so on. In addition to circumferential modes, waveforms can also propagate radially from the center of the disc. Such waves are like ripples observed after dropping a pebble into a lake. The fundamental radial mode, corresponding to  s = 0, resembles deflection under uniform pressure (see Fig.\u00a0 6a). Higher radial modes with  s = 1, 2,  etc form \u2018sinusoidal\u2019 waves in the radial direction.\n ( a) Vibration modes consist of angular waves denoted with n\u2009=\u20091 for one wave, n\u2009=\u20092 for two waves, n\u2009=\u20093 for three waves, as well as radial waves propagating from the center of the disc toward the circumference, which are denoted with s\u2009=\u20090 (resembling deflected shape under uniform pressure, s\u2009=\u20091 for one axisymmetric wave). Combination of both radial and angular components appears at higher frequencies (e.g. n\u2009=\u20091 and s\u2009=\u20092). ( b) Vibrational signal transferred to the sphere by the first set of the forward and backward travelling waves in the rotating disc is bi-modal. ( c) Cumulative effect of the first three modes (f 1,0\u2009+\u2009f 0,0\u2009+\u2009f 2,0) compared with the superposition of the first two modes and the first mode signal only. When multiple travelling waves are excited, the excitation becomes multi-modal and the signal increasingly irregular. ( d) Computational vibrational mode of the actual cutting disc with a central hole (n\u2009=\u20094, s\u2009=\u20090 with  \\({f}_{B}=713\\,Hz\\) and  \\({f}_{F}=2175\\,Hz\\)), ( e) Vibrational mode of a ceramic sphere in a flexible continuum (9340\u2009Hz), ( f) metallic foam vibrational mode accounting for the interactions between multiple embedded spheres.\n Timoshenko  26 expressed free vibrations of a rotating disc as a product of both radial and angular components varying in time, as:\n  where  \u03c9  ns = 2 \u03c0 f  ns is the natural frequency of vibrations corresponding to the superposition of angular,  n and radial,  s modes. Using trigonometric identities,\u00a0equation ( 1) can be simplified to:\n  One should note that natural frequency of the disc depends on the spinning speed, namely  \u03c9  ns =  f( \u03c9  disc) is a function of the disc rotational velocity because spinning produces centrifugal tension in the disc, and consequently stiffens it. A careful reader might also recognize that the modal shapes are given in the disc frame of reference, which is rotating with the disc. An external observer measuring deflections of a fixed point in the contact with the rim, such as an embedded ceramic sphere, traces a point moving counterclockwise relatively to the disc spinning clockwise. The coordinate of such a point in the spinning frame of reference is  \u03b8 point ( t) =  \u03b8 0 \u2212  \u03c9  disc t, where  \u03b8 0 is the initial angular position. Thus, a point, with  R  point,  \u03b8  point coordinates in the stationary frame of reference, experiences the following excitation:\n $$\\begin{array}{rcl}z({R}_{point},{\\theta }_{point}(t),t) &amp; = &amp; {z}_{s}({R}_{point})\\cdot \\,\\sin (n({\\theta }_{0}-{\\omega }_{disc}t)\\pm {\\omega }_{ns}t)\\\\ &amp; = &amp; {z}_{s}({R}_{point})\\cdot [\\sin (n({\\theta }_{0}-{\\omega }_{disc}t)+{\\omega }_{ns}t)\\\\ &amp; &amp; +\\,\\sin (n({\\theta }_{0}-{\\omega }_{disc}t)-{\\omega }_{ns}t)]\\\\ &amp; = &amp; {z}_{s}({R}_{point})\\cdot [\\,\\sin (({\\omega }_{ns}-n{\\omega }_{disc})t+n{\\theta }_{0})\\\\ &amp; &amp; -\\,\\sin (({\\omega }_{ns}+n{\\omega }_{disc})t-n{\\theta }_{0})]\\\\ &amp; = &amp; {z}_{s}({R}_{point})\\cdot [\\sin \\left(n\\left[\\left(\\frac{{\\omega

}_{0}\\right]\\right)]\\end{array}$$\n Thereby, a stationary point in space such as a ceramic sphere at the rim of the rotating disc senses two waves, namely the (B)ackward and the (F)orward travelling waves, with rotational frequencies:\n $$\\begin{array}{ccc}{\\omega }_{ns\\,F}^{sphere} &amp; = &am\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-21 11:01:36", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "max-o-matic for forbes Kurt\u00a0Rathmann told his big-name investors he had developed groundbreaking AI to do the books for small businesses. In reality, humans did most of the work.\n  Accounting is the bane of small business, a tedious task made worse by its costly expense. Kurt Rathmann\u2019s startup had a magic fix: artificial intelligence-powered tools that could replace the accountant, and do so much more. For a fraction of the cost, ScaleFactor promised to take care of bookkeeping, bills and taxes. If customers had doubts, they were reassured by the $100 million invested by big-name venture capital firms. \u201cBecause evenings are for families, not finance,\u201d ScaleFactor\u2019s website proclaimed.\n But some of the startup founders and cafe owners who did take the night off soon regretted their decision to hire ScaleFactor: they didn\u2019t get what they paid for. Instead of software producing financial statements, dozens of accountants did most of it manually from ScaleFactor\u2019s Austin headquarters or from an outsourcing office in the Philippines, according to former employees. Some customers say they received books filled with errors, and were forced to re-hire accountants, or clean up the mess themselves.\n  None of this was known publicly last month, when Rathmann announced that ScaleFactor was closing. In an  interview with  Forbes on June 23, the CEO blamed the Covid-19 pandemic for almost halving ScaleFactor\u2019s $7 million in annual recurring revenue as demand from small businesses crumbled. About 100 people would be laid off with three months of severance, and cash would be returned to investors \u2014 a seemingly tidy end to another startup afflicted by the pandemic.\n Customers were the first to cry foul. \u201cIf you&#39;re one of the investors that gave these clowns $100 million...You should know they&#39;ve flushed it down the toilet with poor product and poor service,\u201d Lindsey Reinders, a ScaleFactor customer, wrote online after seeing the news. \u201cCOVID-19 is just a convenient scapegoat.\u201d\n  Though the pandemic may have been a death knell, ScaleFactor was on rocky ground long before,  Forbes found. Technology startups are often rewarded for a \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it\u201d mentality by venture capital firms willing to throw money at a product until it meets expectations. But ScaleFactor used aggressive sales tactics and prioritized chasing capital instead of building software that ultimately fell far short of what it promised, according to interviews with 15 former employees and executives. When customers fled, executives tried to obscure the real damage.\n Along the way, big name VC shops including San Francisco-based Bessemer Venture Partners, Canaan Partners of Menlo Park and New York\u2019s Coatue Management continued to pour more money into the business, compelling ScaleFactor to keep growing with a software product that proclaimed to replace accountants, but was relying on them all along.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what I found out ScaleFactor is: pretty much a glorified bookkeeping firm,\u201d says one accountant, who, like other former ScaleFactor employees that spoke to  Forbes, asked to remain anonymous because they signed non-disclosure agreements and feared retaliation from the company.\n The typical process of accounting involves thorough consultations to understand the nuances of a company\u2019s books; for instance, whether to consider an Amazon purchase as an expense or bill payment. Errors in this process can lead to bills being paid twice or not being paid at all, snowballing into disaster.\n  ScaleFactor promised to digitize this process with a dashboard centered on five main automated tools: bookkeeping, financial forecasting, bill pay, tax completion and payroll. Customers just had to hand over paperwork, receipts and login information for their sales software.\n For its core bookkeeping tool, ScaleFactor told customers that after an initial consultation, the artificial intelligence-powered product would do the work: pull numbers from other software, like Quickbooks or Xero, and then figure out how transactions should be listed or organized. Rather than monthly statements, ScaleFactor\u2019s software would show real-time updates on its portal, according to sales materials seen by  Forbes.\n  \u201cIf you&#39;re one of the investors that gave these clowns $100 million...You should know they&#39;ve flushed it down the toilet with poor product and poor service.\u201d\n  But in reality, the tool was glitchy and couldn&#39;t be relied on to accurately sort transactions, so ScaleFactor employed a team of bookkeepers and accountants who instead would manually complete a customer\u2019s books or correct errors from the software, according to employees who worked on its product, accounting and customer sales teams. To bolster this effort, ScaleFactor hired The Outsourced Accountant, an offshore firm in the Philippines, to help. But no matter where they worked, the unpredictable technology continued to lead to errors in customers\u2019 books.\n After cancelling her contract in April, Reinders, who complained online, says that she learned a ScaleFactor employee had incorrectly credited $17,000 to a customer of her e-commerce business. But by the time the error was realized more than 6 months after the fact, she was unable to recoup the money because a collectable term period had expired. &#34;We had really good, clear, clean books when we hired them,&#34; she says. (ScaleFactor offered her a partial refund on her annual $23,000 contract, Reinders says, if she signed a non-disclosure agreement barring her from talking about her experience; she didn\u2019t.)\n  Now that the company is closing, other ScaleFactor customers are reckoning with the risks of doing business with a startup that might over-promise and under-deliver. San Francisco-based coffee shop owners Cornelia and Robert Stang, are hiring a new accountant to scrub months of erroneous bookkeeping. \u201cHow hard can this be? We are a coffee shop,\u201d Cornelia recalled telling ScaleFactor when she abandoned her contract this year. \u201cIf you can\u2019t fix our problem you can\u2019t fix anybody\u2019s.\u201d\n ScaleFactor declined to make Rathmann available for an interview for this article and would only respond to emailed questions, before replying: \u201cThe email below is filled with numerous factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations,\u201d said Rathman in an emailed statement sent by a spokesperson. \u201cI have no further comment.\u201d\n  \u201cThat\u2019s what I found out ScaleFactor is: pretty much a glorified bookkeeping firm,\u201d says one accountant.\n  Investors Bessemer and Coatue, two of the firms that led funding rounds into the company, also declined to comment while the third, Canaan, didn\u2019t respond. (Bessemer partners with  Forbes on its Cloud 100 list.)\n R athmann, 33, was born an entrepreneur. While his friends saved pennies for video games, he  mowed lawns to save for his first business. At 17, he owned a company that installed lighting in Houston homes. By the time he launched ScaleFactor in 2014, he had worked as an auditor at KPMG, and as a CFO at a small telecommunications company. In these roles, Rathmann  saw firsthand a glaring need for technology to help small businesses with their bookkeeping services.\n  ScaleFactor got its big break in 2017 at Techstars Austin, a startup accelerator, that was a co-investor in an early\u00a0$2.5 million funding round. It then caught the attention of Michael Gilroy, an associate at Canaan Partners (now at Coatue). \u201cGreat products built by teams that understand their customer will win,\u201d Gilroy  wrote in July 2018, when his firm led a $10 million investment in the company. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started at ScaleFactor.\u201d\n Momentum built fast, and six months later ScaleFactor landed $30 million in a financing round led by Bessemer partner Byron Deeter, a prominent Silicon Valley cloud-computing investor who had made prescient bets on Box, DocuSign and Twilio. (He was also a founding partner of the    Forbes Cloud 100.)\n Despite the votes of confidence from well-known investors, customers were finding that ScaleFactor was falling short. Patrick Coddou, whose e-commerce business paid ScaleFactor more than $10,000, requested to cancel in April 2019 after his statements, expected to be delivered on a real-time basis, were delivered monthly because they were being processed manually. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t deliver on the promise,\u201d he says.\n Potential investors were coming to similar conclusions. Ahead of yet another funding round, multiple venture capital firms passed on investing, according to people familiar with their decisions, having determined that ScaleFactor was more of a services business than a software platform.\n  During due diligence, one of these potential investors learned that ScaleFactor had a customer service team who they were told functioned as \u201caccount managers.\u201d Further inquiry revealed the employees were accountants. \u201cSo the software might look automated, but they actually had all these people on the backend,\u201d the potential investor said.\n The fact was further obscured by ScaleFactor\u2019s creative accounting: rather than budgeting the customer service team under \u201ccost of goods sold,\u201d ScaleFactor listed related costs under a separate category, clouding the true amount spent on servicing the product, according to two people familiar with the business.\n  In the end, the only tool with a true automation component, the potential investor found and employees confirmed, was an internal workflow engine, or \u201ca guided to-do list\u201d for ScaleFactor employees that organized tasks required to close a customer\u2019s books.\n E ven as doubts about its product emerged, ScaleFactor scored a term sheet for a $60 million funding round at the start of June 2019. Coatue Management, a large technology investor overseeing $16 billion in assets, led the new funding round, joined by Bessemer, Canaan and others.\n At a meeting to announce the impending funding to employees, ScaleFactor\u2019s then-chief revenue officer David Loia told the sales team that if it could sell $800,000 in new bookings for the month of June, ScaleFactor would double the team\u2019s bonuses, several employees say. (Loia declined to comment.) \u201cThis is the chance of a lifetime,\u201d one person who attended the meeting recalled Loia saying. \u201cNo deal is off the table.\u201d\n Even though ScaleFactor was under confidentiality provisions barring it from discussing the funding round outside the company, Robert Stang, the coffee shop owner, says he was offered a discount because ScaleFactor was chasing a sales target ahead of an impending series C funding round. \u201cThis gave them a push for sales,\u201d Stang recalled the ScaleFactor employee saying. He signed the $6,000 contract on June 18 to lock in the discount, even though his first bill wasn\u2019t due until October, according to a copy of the contract seen by  Forbes .\n Some customers were offered discounts in exchange for a reference; others were signed on without billing information, former sales employees say. At the end of the month, the sales team was told the target had been met. The company celebrated by throwing them a party at an arts and crafts factory in East Austin, where employees took photos with oversized bonus checks.\n  \u201cWe really thought we could automate the entire back office of a small business,\u201d said Kurt Rathmann.\n  But a few weeks later, the sales team learned they would not receive bonuses after all: some of the deals had been illegitimate, and the target had in fact not been met. ScaleFactor got the funding anyway, in a round that valued the company at $360 million.\n A s ScaleFactor scrambled to add new customers, existing customers were demanding refunds. The outflow only increased after the funding round closed.\n David Rathmann, the CEO\u2019s brother hired in April 2019, held weekly meetings called \u201cChurn Desk\u201d where cancellation requests were prioritized rather than immediately processed; if a customer threatened to complain on social media, they would be let go quicker, for example. This had the effect of delaying the true churn figures from appearing in ScaleFactor\u2019s Salesforce data, which was used in board presentations. The true backlog of pending cancellations and cancellation requests were recorded in a private Google spreadsheet, four people who attended the meetings say. (ScaleFactor would not make Rathmann available for comment.)\n  Executives, including Kurt Rathmann, were stunned during a different weekly meeting in October 2019 when an employee responsible for tracking churn showed that close to $600,000 in annual recurring revenue was at risk of being lost \u2014 in part due to customers indicating or requesting cancellation \u2014 according to multiple people with knowledge of the matter. An informal limit on the value of contracts allowed to be cancelled during Churn Desk meetings was then imposed in an attempt to slow the outflow.\n In January 2020 Kurt Rathmann called an all-hands meeting to announce that ScaleFactor would pivot to a marketplace model that connected traditional accountants with their clients. About 40 employees, mostly accountants and bookkeepers, were laid off when it was announced in February as ScaleFactor \u201c2.020.\u201d\n  Covid-19 swept the United States the following month, and existing customers weren\u2019t buying in; Robert and Cornelia Stang balked after being told their contract would jump from $500-a-month to $1,700. In the spring, investors discussed ScaleFactor\u2019s future before deciding to shutter operations, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.\n At the end of the day, Kurt Rathmann explained to  Forbes last month, customers were craving a person, rather than a computer to do their accounting. \u201cWe really thought we could automate the entire back office of a small business,\u201d Rathmann said. A lofty goal that more money couldn\u2019t achieve.\n  Get Forbes&#39; daily top headlines straight to your inbox\u00a0for news on the world&#39;s most important entrepreneurs and superstars, expert

"note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Nicolas Bourbaki (   [nik\u0254la bu\u0281baki]) is the collective  pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the  \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS). Founded in 1934\u20131935, the  Bourbaki group originally intended to prepare a new  textbook in  analysis. Over time the project became much more ambitious, growing into a large series of textbooks published under the Bourbaki name, meant to treat modern  pure mathematics. The series is known collectively as the   \u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique ( Elements of Mathematics), the group&#39;s central work. Topics treated in the series include  set theory,  abstract algebra,  topology, analysis,  Lie groups and  Lie algebras.\n Bourbaki was founded in response to the effects of the  First World War which caused the death of a generation of French mathematicians; as a result, young university instructors were forced to use dated texts. While teaching at the  University of Strasbourg,  Henri Cartan complained to his colleague  Andr\u00e9 Weil of the inadequacy of available course material, which prompted Weil to propose a meeting with others in Paris to collectively write a modern analysis textbook. The group&#39;s core founders were Cartan,  Claude Chevalley,  Jean Delsarte,  Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 and Weil; others participated briefly during the group&#39;s early years, and membership has changed gradually over time. Although former members openly discuss their past involvement with the group, Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret.\n The group&#39;s namesake derives from the 19th century French general  Charles-Denis Bourbaki,  [3] who had a career of successful military campaigns before suffering a dramatic loss in the  Franco-Prussian War. The name was therefore familiar to early 20th century French students. Weil remembered an ENS  student prank in which an upperclassman posed as a professor and presented a &#34;theorem of Bourbaki&#34;; the name was later adopted.\n The Bourbaki group holds regular private conferences for the purpose of drafting and expanding the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments. Topics are assigned to subcommittees, drafts are debated, and unanimous agreement is required before a text is deemed fit for publication. Although slow and labor-intensive, the process results in a work which meets the group&#39;s standards for  rigour and generality. The group is also associated with the  S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, a regular series of lectures presented by members and non-members of the group, also published and disseminated as written documents. Bourbaki maintains an office at the ENS.  [4]\n Nicolas Bourbaki was influential in 20th century mathematics, particularly during the middle of the century when volumes of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments appeared frequently. The group is noted among mathematicians for its rigorous presentation and for introducing the notion of a  mathematical structure, an idea related to the broader, interdisciplinary concept of  structuralism.  [5]  [6]  [7] Bourbaki&#39;s work informed the  New Math, a trend in elementary math education during the 1960s. Although the group remains active, its influence is considered to have declined due to infrequent publication of new volumes of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments. However the collective&#39;s most recent publication appeared in 2016, treating  algebraic topology.\n    Charles-Denis Sauter Bourbaki was born on 22 April 1816 in  Pau, France, to a family of Greek origin. He became a successful general during the era of  Napoleon III, serving in the  Crimean War and other conflicts. During the  Franco-Prussian war however, Charles-Denis Bourbaki suffered a major defeat. At the time of the  Siege of Metz, he was lured to Britain on false pretenses of a peace conference, and upon return to the continent he was tasked with lifting the  Siege of Belfort, an effort which failed. Charles-Denis Bourbaki was forced to retreat with his army\u2014the  Arm\u00e9e de l&#39;Est\u2014across the Swiss border. The force was disarmed by the Swiss, and the general unsuccessfully attempted suicide. Charles-Denis Bourbaki later died on 27 September 1897, and the dramatic story of his defeat entered the French consciousness.  [8]  [9]\n  In the early 20th century, the First World War affected Europeans of all professions and social classes, including mathematicians and male students who fought and died in the front. For example, the French mathematician  Gaston Julia, a pioneer in the study of  fractals, lost his nose during the war and wore a leather strap over the affected part of his face for the rest of his life. The deaths of ENS students resulted in a  lost generation in the French mathematical community;  [10] the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (c. 1900\u20131918, especially 1910\u20131916) and populations considered.  [11]  [12] Furthermore, Bourbaki founder Andr\u00e9 Weil remarked in his memoir  Apprenticeship of a Mathematician that France and Germany took different approaches with their intellegentsia during the war: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French  culture of  egalitarianism.  [12]\n A succeeding generation of mathematics students attended the ENS during the 1920s, including Weil and others, the future founders of Bourbaki. During his time as a student, Weil recalled a prank in which an upperclassman,  Raoul Husson , posed as a professor and gave a math lecture, ending with a prompt: &#34;Theorem of Bourbaki: you are to prove the following...&#34;. Weil was also aware of a similar stunt in which a student claimed to be from the fictional, impoverished nation of &#34;Poldevia&#34; and soliticed the public for donations.  [13]  [14] Weil had strong interests in languages and  Indian culture, having learned  Sanskrit and read the  Bhagavad Gita.  [15]  [16] After graduating from the ENS and obtaining his doctorate, Weil took a teaching stint at the  Aligarh Muslim University in India. While there, Weil met the mathematician  Damodar Kosambi, who was engaged in a power struggle with one of his colleagues. Weil suggested that Kosambi write an article with material attributed to one &#34;Bourbaki&#34;, in order to show off his knowledge to the colleague.  [17] Kosambi took the suggestion, attributing the material discussed in the article to &#34;the little-known Russian mathematician  D. Bourbaki, who was poisoned during the Revolution.&#34; It was the first article in the mathematical literature with material attributed to the eponymous &#34;Bourbaki&#34;.  [18]  [19]  [20] Weil&#39;s stay in India was short-lived; he attempted to revamp the mathematics department at Aligarh, without success.  [21] The university administration planned to fire Weil and promote his colleague Vijayaraghavan to the vacated position. However, Weil and Vijayaraghavan respected one another. Rather than play any role in the drama, Vijayaraghavan instead resigned, later informing Weil of the plan.  [22] Weil returned to Europe to seek another teaching position. He ended up at the University of Strasbourg, joining his friend and colleague Henri Cartan.  [23]\n    During their time together at Strasbourg, Weil and Cartan regularly complained to each other regarding the inadequacy of available course material for  calculus instruction. In his memoir  Apprenticeship, Weil described his solution in the following terms: &#34;One winter day toward the end of 1934, I came upon a great idea that would put an end to these ceaseless interrogations by my comrade. &#39;We are five or six friends&#39;, I told him some time later, &#39;who are in charge of the same mathematics curriculum at various universities. Let us all come together and regulate these matters once and for all, and after this, I shall be delivered of these questions.&#39; I was unaware of the fact that Bourbaki was born at that instant.&#34;  [23] Cartan confirmed the account.  [24]\n  The first, unofficial meeting of the Bourbaki collective took place at noon on Monday, 10 December 1934, at the Caf\u00e9 Grill-Room A. Capoulade, Paris, in the  Latin Quarter.  [25]  [26]  [27]  [28]  [b] Six mathematicians were present: Henri Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonn\u00e9,  Ren\u00e9 de Possel, and Andr\u00e9 Weil. Most of the group were based outside Paris and were in town to attend the Julia Seminar, a conference prepared with the help of Gaston Julia at which several future Bourbaki members and associates presented.  [31]  [32]  [c] The group resolved to collectively write a treatise on analysis, for the purpose of standardizing calculus instruction in French universities. The project was especially meant to supersede the text of  \u00c9douard Goursat, which the group found to be badly outdated, and to improve its treatment of  Stokes&#39; Theorem.  [27]  [36]  [37]  [38] The founders were also motivated by a desire to incorporate ideas from the  G\u00f6ttingen school, particularly from exponents  Hilbert,  Noether and  B.L. van der Waerden. Further, in the aftermath of World War I, there was a certain nationalist impulse to save French mathematics from decline, especially in competition with Germany. As Dieudonn\u00e9 stated in an interview, &#34;Without meaning to boast, I can say that it was Bourbaki that saved French mathematics from extinction.&#34;  [39]\n Jean Delsarte was particularly favorable to the collective aspect of the proposed project, observing that such a working style could insulate the group&#39;s work against potential later individual claims of  copyright.  [36]  [40]  [d] As various topics were discussed, Delsarte also suggested that the work begin in the most abstract, axiomatic terms possible, treating all of mathematics prerequisite to analysis from scratch.  [42]  [43] The group agreed to the idea, and this foundational area of the proposed work was referred to as the &#34;Abstract Packet&#34; (Paquet Abstrait).  [44]  [45]  [46]  Working titles were adopted: the group styled itself as the  Committee for the Treatise on Analysis, and their proposed work was called the  Treatise on Analysis ( Trait\u00e9 d&#39;analyse).  [47]  [48] In all, the collective held ten preliminary biweekly meetings at A. Capoulade before its first official, founding conference in July 1935.  [48]  [49] During this early period,  Paul Dubreil,  Jean Leray and  Szolem Mandelbrojt joined and participated. Dubreil and Leray left the meetings before the following summer, and were respectively replaced by new participants  Jean Coulomb and  Charles Ehresmann.  [47]  [50]\n  The group&#39;s official, founding conference was held in  Besse-en-Chandesse, from 10\u201317 July 1935.  [51]  [52] At the time of the official founding, the membership consisted of the six attendees at the first lunch of 10 December 1934, together with Coulomb, Ehresmann and Mandelbrojt. On 16 July, the members took a walk to alleviate the boredom of unproductive proceedings. During the malaise, some decided to  skinny-dip in the nearby  Lac Pavin, repeatedly yelling &#34;Bourbaki!&#34;  [53] At the close of the first official conference, the group renamed itself &#34;Bourbaki&#34;, in reference to the general and prank as recalled by Weil and others.  [46]  [e] During 1935, the group also resolved to establish the mathematical  personhood of their collective pseudonym by getting an article published under its name.  [51]  [55] A first name had to be decided; a full name was required for publication of any article. To this end, Ren\u00e9 de Possel&#39;s wife Eveline &#34;baptized&#34; the pseudonym with the first name of Nicolas, becoming Bourbaki&#39;s &#34;godmother&#34;.  [51]  [56]  [57]  This allowed for the publication of a second article with material attributed to Bourbaki, this time under &#34;his&#34; own name.  [59] Henri Cartan&#39;s father  \u00c9lie Cartan, also a mathematician and supportive of the group, presented the article to the publishers, who accepted it.  [55]\n At the time of Bourbaki&#39;s founding, Ren\u00e9 de Possel and his wife Eveline were in the process of divorcing. Eveline remarried to Andr\u00e9 Weil in 1937, and de Possel left the Bourbaki collective some time later. This sequence of events has caused speculation that de Possel left the group because of the remarriage,  [60] however this suggestion has also been criticized as possibly historically inaccurate, since de Possel is supposed to have remained active in Bourbaki for years after Andr\u00e9&#39;s marriage to Eveline.  [61]\n  Bourbaki&#39;s work slowed significantly during the  Second World War, though the group survived and later flourished. Some members of Bourbaki were Jewish, and therefore forced to flee from certain parts of Europe at certain times. Weil, who was Jewish, spent the summer of 1939 in Finland with his wife Eveline, as guests of  Lars Ahlfors. Due to their travel near the border, the couple were suspected as Soviet spies by Finnish authorities near the onset of the  Winter War, and Andr\u00e9 was later arrested.  [62] According to an anecdote, Weil was to have been executed but for the passing mention of his case to  Rolf Nevanlinna, who asked that Weil&#39;s sentence be commuted.  [63] However, the accuracy of this detail is dubious.  [64] Weil reached the United States in 1941, later taking another teaching stint in  S\u00e3o Paulo from 1945\u201347 before settling at the  University of Chicago from 1947\u20131958 and finally the  Institute for Advanced Study in  Princeton, where he spent the remainder of his career. Although Weil remained in touch with the Bourbaki collective and visited Europe and the group periodically following the war, his level of involvement with Bourbaki never returned to that at the time of founding.\n Second-generation Bourbaki member  Laurent Schwartz was also Jewish and found pickup work as a math teacher in rural  Vichy France. Moving from village to village, Schwartz planned his movements in order to evade capture by the  Nazis.  [65] On one occasion Schwartz found himself trapped overnight in a certain village, as his expected transportation home was unavailable. There were two inns in town: a comfortable, well-appointed one, and a very poor one with no heating and bad beds. Schwartz&#39;s instinct told him to stay at the poor inn; overnight, the Nazis raided the good inn, leaving the poor inn unchecked.  [66]\n Meanwhile Jean Delsarte, a Catholic, was mobilized in 1939 as the captain of an audio reconnaissance battery. He was forced to lead the unit&#39;s retreat from the northeastern part of France toward the south. While passing near the Swiss border, Delsarte overheard a soldier say &#34;We are the army of Bourbaki&#34;;  [67]  [68] the 19th century general&#39;s retreat was known to the French. Delsarte had coincidentally led a retreat similar to that of the collective&#39;s namesake.\n   Following the war, Bourbaki had solidified the plan of its work, and settled into a productive routine. Bourbaki regularly published volumes of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments during the 1950s and 1960s, and enjoyed its greatest influence during this period.  [69]  [70] Over time the founding members gradually left the group, slowly being replaced with younger newcomers including  Jean-Pierre Serre and  Alexander Grothendieck. Serre, Grothendieck and Laurent Schwartz were awarded the  Fields Medal during the postwar period, in 1954, 1966 and 1950 respectively. Later members  Alain Connes and  Jean-Christophe Yoccoz also received the Fields Medal, in 1982 and 1994 respectively.  [71]\n The later practice of accepting scientific awards contrasted with some of the founders&#39; views.  [72] During the 1930s, Weil and Delsarte petitioned against a French national scientific &#34;medal system&#34; proposed by the  Nobel  physics laureate  Jean Perrin. Weil and Delsarte felt that the institution of such a system would increase unconstructive pettiness and jealousy in the scientific community.  [73] Despite this, the Bourbaki group had previously successfully petitioned Perrin for a government  grant to support its normal operations.  [74] Like the founders, Grothendieck was also averse to awards, albeit for  pacifist reasons. Although Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966, he declined to attend the ceremony in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet government.  [75] In 1988, Grothendieck rejected the  Crafoord Prize outright, citing no personal need to accept prize money, lack of recent relevant output, and general distrust of the scientific community.  [76]\n Born to Jewish  anarchist parentage, Grothendieck survived the  Holocaust and advanced rapidly in the French mathematical community, despite poor education during the war.  [77] Grothendieck&#39;s teachers included Bourbaki&#39;s founders, and so he joined the group. During Grothendieck&#39;s membership, Bourbaki reached an impasse concerning its foundational approach. Grothendieck advocated for a reformulation of the group&#39;s work using  category theory as its theoretical basis, as opposed to set theory. The proposal was ultimately rejected  [78]  [79]  [80] in part because the group had already committed itself to a rigid track of sequential presentation, with multiple already-published volumes. Following this, Grothendieck left Bourbaki &#34;in anger&#34;.  [38]  [65]  [81] Biographers of the collective have described Bourbaki&#39;s unwillingness to start over in terms of category theory as a missed opportunity.  [65]  [82]  [83]\n During the founding period, the group chose the Parisian publisher  Hermann to issue installments of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments. Hermann was led by Enrique Freymann, a friend of the founders willing to publish the group&#39;s project, despite financial risk. During the 1970s, Bourbaki entered a protracted legal battle with Hermann over matters of copyright and  royalty payment. Although the Bourbaki group won the suit and retained collective copyright of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments, the dispute slowed the group&#39;s productivity.  [84]  [85] Former member Pierre Cartier described the lawsuit as a  pyrrhic victory, saying: &#34;As usual in legal battles, both parties lost and the lawyer got rich.&#34;  [65] Later editions of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments were published by  Masson, and modern editions are published by  Springer.  [86] From the 1980s through the 2000s, Bourbaki published very infrequently, with the result that in 1998   Le Monde pronounced the collective &#34;dead&#34;.  [87] However, in the 2010s Bourbaki resumed publication of the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments with a revised chapter on algebra and a new book on algebraic topology.\n   Bourbaki holds periodic conferences for the purpose of expanding the  \u00c9l\u00e9ments; these conferences are the central activity of the group&#39;s working life. Subcommittees are assigned to write drafts on specific material, and the drafts are later presented, vigorously debated and re-drafted at the conferences. Unanimous agreement is required before any material is deemed acceptable for publication.  [89]  [90]  [91] A given piece of material may require six or more drafts over a period of several years, and some drafts are never developed into completed work.  [90]  [92] Bourbaki&#39;s writing process has therefore been described as &#34; Sisyphean&#34;.  [91] Although the method is slow, it yields a final product which satisfies the group&#39;s standards for  mathematical rigour, one of Bourbaki&#39;s main priorities in the treatise. Bourbaki&#39;s emphasis on rigour was a reaction to the style of  Henri Poincar\u00e9, who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical  intuition at the cost of thorough presentation.  [f] During the project&#39;s early years, Dieudonn\u00e9 served as the group&#39;s scribe, authoring several final drafts which were ultimately published. For this purpose, Dieudonn\u00e9 adopted an impersonal  writing style which was not his own, but which was used to craft material acceptable to the entir\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-21 10:54:23",

"note_en": "Higher education costs a lot. But inside the walls of colleges and universities, the real economy is based on prestige, not dollars. Prestige is the &#34;money&#34; of higher education \u2014 it\u2019s what motivates everyone from institutional leaders on down.\n  The prestige economy that surrounds doctoral programs is almost entirely defined by research. That\u2019s a constricted way to assess those programs, and an approach fraught with problems \u2014 the biggest one being that it doesn\u2019t look at enough variables.\n  The National Research Council\u2019s  influential ranking of doctoral programs, for example, has an exceedingly narrow ambit: It measures research output only, and it ranks programs by the scholarly productivity of their professors. Worse, the ranking system itself is poorly handled.\n  The NRC gathers data via questionnaire, and the results don\u2019t measure achievement. Instead, they casually survey reputation. Professors are asked to identify high-ranking programs in their field based on nothing more than the impressions of the moment when they happen to be filling out the survey. (I know that from personal experience: I once started filling out the questionnaire, realized its limitations, quit in frustration, and never filled out another.) Because no evidence is solicited for respondents\u2019 rankings, NRC findings resemble the results of the hoaxes that routinely rank Princeton\u2019s ( nonexistent) law school in the top 10.\n  Ranking graduate programs solely according to their research output \u2014 even if that were actually being done fairly and accurately \u2014 would be like ranking cars solely by their engines. The engine is important, certainly, but anyone who drives knows that other parts of the car matter, too, like suspension, brakes, and safety features.\n  Our graduate schools need to be assessed by more student-centered measures. Yes, prospective students should know something about the influence of the research performed by a program\u2019s faculty. But graduate school isn\u2019t just a research pageant. It\u2019s also school \u2014 and the way a program treats its students is bound to be important to someone deciding whether to spend years as one of them.\n  Applicants need to know how well a program professionalizes its students, for example. How is the advising? What about the career counseling and job preparation \u2014 for both academic and nonacademic careers? What kinds of support (financial and otherwise) does the program offer students, and for how long? What is the typical time to degree? The rate of attrition? Friendliness to students from disadvantaged groups?\n  Those are just a few of the questions increasingly asked by would-be graduate students. Right now they can\u2019t turn to any single place to get the answers. They can only investigate programs one by one. Moreover, individual programs sometimes don\u2019t make available the kinds of information that students need \u2014 such as the career outcomes of graduates.\n  What if graduate-school applicants could get that kind of student-centered information in one place, on one website? That information is as important to students \u2014 probably more important \u2014 than how many citations the faculty have earned for their research publications.\n  A new assessment system wouldn\u2019t need to rank programs against each other according to some kind of absolute (and probably unsound) scale. Instead, it could gather information and present it transparently.\n    As anyone with a cellphone or a laptop knows, Yelp operates as a clearinghouse of information on restaurants, bars, barbers, and just about anyplace where people might consider shopping. The customers supply the information and base their ratings on a five-star system. But the proprietors also interact with the commenters, and the Yelp site provides links to company websites for both reviewers and the reviewed.\n  As of now, there is no agreed-upon format for collecting information on the career outcomes of M.A.s and Ph.D.s, and no expectation that graduate programs should provide it. Many programs rely on a &#34;greatest hits&#34; approach: They list only the most enviable jobs landed by their graduates. But how salient is that data if most of the program\u2019s graduates don\u2019t get those jobs?\n  Research rankings also cast a long shadow on this selectively curated presentation because the faculty jobs that make the greatest-hits chart are usually located at research universities. The question is: How best to move away from such a thorough reliance on this narrow measure?\n  A Yelp-like national website that rated \u2014 not ranked \u2014 programs and graduate schools would go a long way toward solving the problem. The information on it could be supplied by departments, and also by students and graduates. Yelp for graduate students would save more than time: It would offer applicants (and current students) the kinds of relevant information they need, in an easy-to-use format.\n  It would also create an accountability that doesn\u2019t exist now. A graduate program\u2019s reputation could be based on real data from the providers and broad views from the users \u2014 instead of solely on off-the-cuff, unstudied impressions.\n  Yelp for graduate students could rate programs as they seek to achieve a variety of goals. This endeavor could also provide an agenda for foundations to reward graduate schools and their departments. Among the areas that could use outside funding:\n  Innovative recruitment strategies to achieve a more diverse student cohort \u2014 both by collaborations among academic institutions and by grants based on both financial need and membership in underrepresented groups.\n    Nonfaculty internships \u2014 not just ones outside the ivory tower but also those that might take place on a campus in student services, fund raising, communications, deans offices, and university relations.\n  A lot of those elements are already under discussion in recent debates over graduate-education reform, and some are being tried by programs, graduate schools, and national organizations. Their efforts deserve attention \u2014 and when they work, replication. A collective, student-centered focus through a Yelp-like clearinghouse would help to keep a consistent focus on what needs reforming.\n  A website like this could begin at any institution, with or without foundation support. Think of the free advertising that would come from the association with such a project \u2014 and the good will it would generate. A resource for student-centered information about graduate programs would be a public service. It wouldn\u2019t replace research-based rankings, but it would provide a counterweight to them.\n  What if a doctoral program\u2019s prestige arose, in part, from the way that it treated its students?

"note_en": "With the advent of Vue 3&#39;s composition API, one may write local states and its tightly coupled actions like given below:\n // maths.jsimport { ref } from &#39;vue&#39;;export function useMaths() { const val = ref(0); const increment = () =&gt; (val.value += 1); const decrement = () =&gt; (val.value -= 1); return { val, increment, decrement, };}\n This should look eerily similar to what React offers (if you have used React hooks).\n The above code creates a reactive value called  val and provides two actions to either  increment or  decrement this value.\n This hook or a composable function can be imported into a component and used directly like so:\n &lt;template&gt; {{ val }} &lt;button @click=&#34;increment&#34;&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button @click=&#34;decrement&#34;&gt;Decrement&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt; import { useMaths } from &#39;./maths&#39;; export default { setup: () =&gt; { const { val, increment, decrement } = useMaths(); return { val, increment, decrement, }; }, };&lt;/script&gt;\n The component binds the value and actions to the Vue template. This  useMaths hook can be imported into any number of components and the behaviour can be reused while keeping the states local to the component in which it was used.\n Vue 3 not only allows us to compose the components and the UI but their behaviour as well.\n But what do you do when you realise that the state should have been global instead?\n There are times when you could be thinking that a particular state should be local to a component or a page. But as the app progresses on, this assumption may not hold true anymore.\n Or there might be instances where you just wanted to experiment with the component and flesh out the internal workings while keeping the implementation simple by using local states. But once the experimentation phase is over you just want to reuse the code as much as possible and adapt it to use a global state.\n In these above scenarios, Vue 3 gives us a new trick that we can do with  ref that makes this sort of  migration negligibly cheap to implement.\n  // maths.jsimport { ref } from &#39;vue&#39;;const val = ref(0);export function useMaths() { const increment = () =&gt; (val.value += 1); const decrement = () =&gt; (val.value -= 1); return { val, increment, decrement, };}\n Just move the  ref out of the context of the hook and make it global. Vue will take care of the rest. Each component that uses this hook will all share the same  val.

They dubbed it Proteus after the shape-shifting Greek god, for the way the material metamorphosised in different ways to defend against attacks.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d says Miranda Anderson at the University of Stirling, UK, who worked on the project. Rather than just being a hard surface that resists external pressure, the material turns the force of the drill or cutting mechanism back on itself, as the ceramic spheres create vibrations that disrupt the external force. \u201cIt actually destroys the cutting blade through the sideways jerky vibrations that it creates, or it widens the water jet\u2019s spray,\u201d says Anderson.\n    The material has a second defence mechanism. Attempting to cut it breaks the ceramic spheres into smaller fragments which are even harder and act like very tough sandpaper. \u201cSo the attack mechanism causes the material to become more resistant to the attack,\u201d says Anderson. While an angle grinder took 45 seconds to cut through  steel armour used to protect against explosive mines, it was rendered inoperative by Proteus.\n The only comparable structure in the natural world is  diamond, says Anderson, but Proteus is cheaper and lighter, making it practical for a range of applications, from security doors and barriers to shoe soles or elbow pad and forearm guards for workers. She believes it can be mass-produced, as there is no shortage of the metals and ceramics it is made from.", "posttime": "2020-07-21 10:26:34", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4eba\u9020,material,\u5207\u5272", "title": "\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5207\u5272\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4eba\u9020\u6750\u6599", "title_en": "A New Artificial Material Effectively Cannot Be Cut", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newscientist.com/article/2249275-material-that-cannot-be-cut-would-make-the-ultimate-bike-lock/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4eba\u9020", "material", "\u5207\u5272"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c0c8ed7e097187201f0d75f132eb5905.jpeg", "infoid": 1013181, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0b\u5468\u4e00\uff0c\u4f17\u8bae\u9662\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u5c0f\u7ec4\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c06\u76d8\u95ee\u6765\u81ea\u82f9\u679c(Apple)\u3001\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a(Amazon)\u3001\u8c37\u6b4c(Google)\u548cFacebook\u7684\u56db\u540d\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u8be2\u95ee\u53e6\u4e00\u5bb6\u79d1\u6280\u5de8\u5934\u5fae\u8f6f(Microsoft)\u7684\u4e00\u540d\u9ad8\u7ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u8c03\u67e5\u505a\u597d\u4e86\u51c6\u5907\u3002\n\u636e\u77e5\u60c5\u4eba\u58eb\u900f\u9732\uff0c\u51e0\u5468\u524d\uff0c\u5c0f\u7ec4\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u4f1a\u8bae\u91c7\u8bbf\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u603b\u88c1\u517c\u9996\u5e2d\u6cd5\u52a1\u5b98\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u00b7\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af(Brad Smith)\u3002\u867d\u7136\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u9080\u8bf7\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba9\u4ed6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u8f6f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e4b\u524d\u9762\u4e34\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5927\u578b\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f1a\u8bae\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f4d\u5fae\u8f6f\u9ad8\u7ba1\u4e5f\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5bf9\u82f9\u679c\u8fd0\u8425App Store\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u6b27\u6d32\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u82f9\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u3002\n\u4e0b\u5468\u4e00\uff0c\u4f17\u8bae\u9662\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u5c0f\u7ec4\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c06\u76d8\u95ee\u6765\u81ea\u82f9\u679c(Apple)\u3001\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a(Amazon)\u3001\u8c37\u6b4c(Google)\u548cFacebook\u7684\u56db\u540d\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u8be2\u95ee\u53e6\u4e00\u5bb6\u79d1\u6280\u5de8\u5934\u5fae\u8f6f(Microsoft)\u7684\u4e00\u540d\u9ad8\u7ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u8c03\u67e5\u505a\u597d\u4e86\u51c6\u5907\u3002\n\u51e0\u5468\u524d\uff0c\u5c0f\u7ec4\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u4f1a\u8bae\u91c7\u8bbf\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u603b\u88c1\u517c\u9996\u5e2d\u6cd5\u52a1\u5b98\u5e03\u62c9\u5fb7\u00b7\u53f2\u5bc6\u65af(Brad Smith)\u3002", "note_en": "Next Monday, a House antitrust subcommittee will grill a quartet of CEOs from Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, but the committee has already prepped for a related investigation into the sector by quizzing a top executive from another tech giant: Microsoft.\n Several weeks ago, the subcommittee interviewed Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer of Microsoft, via videoconference, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.

"note_en": "\u201cEach of you were selected to serve on this Board because of your outspoken commitment to free expression, human rights, and democratic values,\u201d the letter\u2019s authors write. \u201cNow is the time to uphold those principles. We humbly ask that you refuse to be complicit in this Facebook charade \u2013\u2013 that you demand sweeping and immediate changes, or walk away.\u201d\n Accountable Tech is a progressive project founded by grassroots campaign organizer and director of the  2017 Tax March Nicole Gill and Jesse Lehrich, who served as foreign policy spokesperson for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid. Lehrich worked on the Clinton campaign\u2019s response to Russian disinformation efforts that year, giving him a front row seat to emerging online threats to U.S. elections.\n  \u201cFacebook specializes in window dressing,\u201d Gill told TechCrunch. \u201cThey have been touting the Oversight Board for years as this grandiose solution, but the platform\u2019s problems are more urgent than ever, and the Board is powerless.\u201d\n A handful of other groups also signed the open letter, including the Center For American Progress Action Fund, Free Press and the Sierra Club. The letter cites findings from Facebook\u2019s recent  civil rights audit that cast doubt on the board\u2019s real power and also notes the oversight body\u2019s  delayed timeline. First announced in late 2018, the board won\u2019t be up and running in time for the 2020 election.\n We understand many people are eager for the Board to officially begin our task of providing independent oversight of Facebook\u2019s content decisions. We share this urgency, but the Board won\u2019t be operational until late Fall.\n Because it is ostensibly tasked with making decisions about what content should be removed from Facebook and Instagram, in theory the board could have played a role in ridding those platforms of election-related misinformation \u2014 a looming threat with November around the corner. But  restrictive bylaws coupled with a focus on reviewing content takedowns rather than content left up meant the oversight effort was widely regarded as  toothless from the outset.\n  Board aside, Facebook is making some efforts to at least disseminate useful voting information to users, a defensive posture the company feels more comfortable in compared to playing offense against potential rule breaking. Last week, the company rolled out  info labels that link to vetted election information on all voting-related posts from federal elected officials, a feature that will soon expand to all voting posts in the U.S.\n In early June, Accountable Tech launched a  memorable Facebook ad campaign targeting the company\u2019s employees on their own platform. The ads, which urged Facebook workers to hold the company to account, came a day after some employees  staged a virtual walkout to protest a now-infamous post in which the president threatened to shoot people protesting the police killing of George Floyd.\n Facebook also faced scrutiny recently for hosting Trump\u2019s  false claims about mail-in voting and those falsehoods remain live on the platform without context or correction. These instances and others are cause for concern as the stakes for social platforms during the 2020 election inch higher and higher, worries made explicit by the open letter\u2019s authors.\n \u201cAs we enter an unprecedented election season\u2014amid a global pandemic, an inflection point for racial justice, and a crisis of truth\u2014we cannot accept Facebook\u2019s toxic status quo, much less a toothless Oversight Board that lends it a false air of legitimacy.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-21 09:39:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

The books challenge readers to find the titular cartoon man, clad in his trusty red-striped shirt and red-striped hat, as he hides in a landscape of red-striped red herrings. When attempting to find Waldo you can scan the page completely from top to bottom, or you can focus your search around certain landmarks where Waldo seems likely to be hiding (in a castle\u2019s moat, riding a blimp). Neither approach is particularly efficient. Which got me to wondering: What if there\u2019s a better way?\n    I knew that Handford had placed Waldo in each of these illustrations, and in my experience, all people\u2014even people who make a living hiding cartoon men in cartoon landscapes\u2014have tendencies, be they conscious and unconscious. True randomness is very difficult to achieve, even if you want to, and according to Handford he does not necessarily aim for unpredictability. \u201cAs I work my way through a picture, I add Wally when I come to what I feel is a good place to hide him,\u201d  he once told Scholastic. Knowing this, is it possible, I wondered, to master  Where\u2019s Waldo by mapping Handford\u2019s patterns?\n      I sought to answer these questions the way any mathematician who has no qualms about appearing ridiculous in public would: I sat in a Barnes &amp; Noble for three hours flipping through all seven  Where\u2019s Waldo books with a tape measure.\n          It may not be immediately clear from looking at this map, but my hunch that there\u2019s a better way to hunt was right. There isn\u2019t one corner of the page where Waldo is always hiding; readers would have already noticed if his patterns were so obvious. What we do see, as highlighted in the map below, is that 53 percent of the time Waldo is hiding within one of two 1.5-inch tall bands, one starting three inches from the bottom of the page and another one starting seven inches from the bottom, stretching across the spread.\n          So, if you want to find Waldo on any given page, a good strategy would be to start by scrutinizing these two bands first, before moving on to other areas. Although 1.5 inches isn\u2019t a particularly narrow range, it\u2019s small enough to focus on without missing Waldo; and over half the time, he\u2019ll be there. To test the efficacy of my approach, I pitted two   Slate colleagues against one another in a  Where\u2019s Waldo showdown. L.V. Anderson searched the 11 spreads in the first Waldo book using the old-fashioned method of scanning the page; Dan Kois worked his way through the same pages, but armed with my findings (and a tape measure). Watch highlights from Dan\u2019s decisive victory here:\n      Perhaps you\u2019re wondering: Are these findings for real? It\u2019s true that it is tempting to see patterns where they don\u2019t exist, and it\u2019s especially easy to do so when there are only 68 points to analyze; it\u2019s a small sample size. But the probability of any two 1.5-inch bands containing at least 50 percent of all Waldo\u2019s is remarkably slim, less than 0.3 percent. In other words, these findings aren\u2019t a coincidence. Waldo is there for a reason.\n    (A quick note on methodology: The books I examined were the seven \u201cprimary books.\u201d While Handford has churned out numerous  puzzle books and other  spin-offs over the years, the official Waldo canon, as I defined it, is comprised of these original seven volumes. Furthermore, the current editions of the first five Waldo books are \u201cSpecial Edition\u201d versions, first released in 1997. Waldo has been hiding where Handford put him in these \u201cSpecial Edition\u201d locations for the last 16 years. If you have a Waldo book on your shelf, chances are you have this version. So in conducting my analysis, I used this most recent hiding spot instead of the original ones. The majority of the series takes place on giant two-page spreads (roughly 20\u201d x 12.5\u201d) and only these pages were used in this analysis.)\n        So we\u2019ve taken care of the question of  where Waldo is. But that leaves a more intriguing question left unanswered:  Why is Waldo there? Why, Waldo? Why are you so likely to hide in these two narrow bands? Why are you rarely at the edges of the page? Why are you rarely in the middle of the page? Why, Waldo?\n  I\u2019d hoped to put the question to Waldo himself, or barring that, to Martin Handford, but the illustrator declined through his publicist to be interviewed for this article. That leaves me to postulate about Waldo\u2019s proclivities.  Let\u2019s start with the constraints Handford was working with in creating his books. Most of the two-page spreads have a \u201cpostcard\u201d from Waldo in the upper left hand corner of the left page, which occupies a space of about 15 square inches. Waldo, clearly, cannot be hidden here. However, the corresponding space on the right hand page is home to Waldo only four times, slightly less than we would expect if Waldo were placed randomly. This suggests that the postcard is not depriving Handford of any favored territory.\n      Handford generally shies away from putting Waldo near the bottom or top of a page, which leads me to theorize that Waldo placement is largely a function of two factors: aversion from extremes and aversion from the middle. While we would expect Waldo to be hidden within an inch-and-a-half of the spread\u2019s top or bottom borders almost 25 percent of the time if Handford were placing him randomly, in practice he is there only in 12 percent of all pages. More surprising is the fact that Waldo is  also unlikely to be in the middle of the page, as you can see from the map above. It\u2019s possible that Handford avoided the edges and centers of the pages out of concern that they may not print clearly. However, Waldo  is placed in these locations occasionally, which weakens this hypothesis. I think it\u2019s more likely that Handford was trying to avoid locations that might be construed as too obvious\u2014i.e. the centers or the corners, where children and adults alike might begin their search. But while this might make Waldo harder to find for the reader whose eyes immediately dart to the center or edge of the page, once you know your quarry is unlikely to be in those places, it actually makes him much easier to find.\n          Correction, Nov. 19, 2013: This article originally misspelled the surname of Where\u2019s Waldo  author Martin Handford. The article also misstated the book\u2019s debut as being 20 years ago. The first Where\u2019s Waldo  was published in 1987.

"note_en": "Christopher J. David had largely ignored the protests in downtown Portland, Ore., but when he saw videos of unidentified federal agents grabbing protesters off the street and throwing them into rented minivans, he felt compelled to act.\n Mr. David, a Navy veteran, said that federal agents\u2019 use of violent tactics against protesters, without the support of the mayor, the governor or local law enforcement, was a violation of the oaths that agents take to support, uphold and defend the Constitution.\n And so, on Saturday, he took a bus downtown to ask the officers how they squared their actions with that oath.\n Instead of getting an answer, Mr. David was beaten with a baton by one federal officer as another doused him with pepper spray,  according to video footage of the encounter. After he walked away from the confrontation, Mr. David was taken to a nearby hospital, where a specialist said his right hand was broken and would require surgery to install pins, screws and plates. He declined pain medication.\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t even paying attention to the protests at all until the feds came in,\u201d Mr. David said in an interview on Sunday night. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became aware.\u201d\n  Protesters have been in the streets of Portland for more than 50 consecutive days, in response to the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis. The arrival of federal officers in the city has re-energized the demonstrations, which continued on Sunday night, with tear gas once again deployed by U.S. agents.\n Kenneth T. Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said on CNN that he was \u201cfamiliar with the video\u201d involving Mr. David and that \u201cmaintaining an appropriate response is an ongoing obligation.\u201d\n Mr. David, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a former varsity wrestler who has lived in Portland since 2006, said he had attended only one protest before \u2014 a march for women\u2019s rights in Washington, D.C., in 1989. As a 53-year-old man with health concerns, he said that the risk of the coronavirus was reason enough to stay away from downtown Portland.\n \u201cIt just didn\u2019t seem worth it to me at that point, but it reached that threshold when I saw Pinochet-type behavior from our own government,\u201d he said, referring to the Chilean dictator.\n With his mind made up, Mr. David grabbed a backpack with some essential items \u2014 migraine medicine, nicotine gum, his wallet and ID cards \u2014 and took a bus downtown, arriving near the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse about 8:15 p.m.\n The courthouse has become  a focus of protesters, as well as the federal Homeland Security agents who have been dispatched to protect it. But the response by those agents in Portland has prompted a backlash over whether the officers are exceeding their arrest authority and violating the rights of protesters by detaining demonstrators in the area around the federal courthouse.\n On Mr. David\u2019s backpack were patches commemorating his time as an officer in the Navy\u2019s Civil Engineering Corps, serving with the construction battalions \u2014 the famed  Seabees.\n He also wore a heather gray sweatshirt with the word \u201cNavy\u201d emblazoned in blue across the top and a ball cap for the Academy\u2019s wrestling team. He wanted the officers to know by sight that he was a veteran, and someone they could talk to.\n \u201cI identified the hell out of myself for a reason, I want to give them pause so we could talk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I wanted to go down there to tell them that I believed they were not following their oath to the Constitution. That was my goal.\u201d\n By 10:45 p.m., Mr. David was just about to leave to return home, he said, when some protesters began removing fencing around the courthouse and federal officers emerged. He made his way to a clutch of federal agents.\n A video shot by Zane Sparling, a reporter with The Portland Tribune, captured what happened next. Officers in camouflage and gas masks beat Mr. David with batons and blasted pepper spray at his face. The shaky cellphone video shows him briefly shoving away the hand of the officer with the spray-can before turning around, walking away and defiantly throwing up the middle fingers of both hands. He turned and faced the officers again, raising his middle fingers even higher \u2014 though a strike from a baton had just shattered his dominant right hand.\n Internet users quickly called him \u201cCaptain Portland\u201d for barely flinching at the blows. Noting how at 6 feet 2 inches tall he towered over the officers, some people compared him to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d character known as the Mountain.  On Twitter, he went from having a handful of followers before the encounter to more than 60,000 on Monday.", "posttime": "2020-07-21 09:16:06", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8001\u5175,veteran,\u8b66\u5bdf", "title": "\u4e00\u4f4d\u6d77\u519b\u8001\u5175\u5728\u6ce2\u7279\u5170\u6709\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8981\u95ee\u8054\u90a6\u8c03\u67e5\u5c40\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6253\u4e86\u4ed6\u4e00\u987f\u3002", "title_en": "Navy Veteran Had a Question for the Feds in Portland.

"note_en": "Millions of Internet users around the world use a VPN to protect their privacy online.\n Another key benefit is that VPNs hide users\u2019 true IP-address, making them more anonymous. This prevents third-party monitoring outfits from unwanted snooping.\n Every year we  ask VPN providers about their logging policies to confirm that they can\u2019t connect a VPN IP-address to a specific user. In the past, we have seen that this is not always the case.\n Today, most of the top providers pride themselves on their \u201cno logging\u201d policies. They go to extreme lengths to ensure that anonymity is taken seriously, and some have hired third-party auditors to back up this claim.\n While we have no reason to doubt these results, not all VPN subscriptions are perfectly anonymous. Even companies with no-log policies can keep records that can link VPN IP-addresses to user accounts.\n That is, when they also offer dedicated IP-addresses, which are different from regular VPN connections.\n  With a dedicated IP-address, which is often sold as an add-on, users get a unique IP-address as opposed to a shared one. This can be very convenient as it reduces annoying captchas and can bypass regular VPN blacklists. However, it comes at an anonymity cost.\n By connecting through a single IP-address, monitoring outfits can build up a profile of the user\u2019s online activity. The real anonymity tradeoff, however, is that the VPN provider knows the user\u2019s IP-address and can connect it to other account information it has on record. This sometimes includes an email address.\n This may not be a concern for most people, but it\u2019s certainly something to keep in mind for the small subset of subscribers that use a dedicated VPN IP-address.\n  Broadly speaking, we would say that the \u201cno logs\u201d policies of VPN providers don\u2019t apply to dedicated IPs. That conclusion is backed up by several VPN providers we reached out to, which include VPNArea, NordVPN, CyberGhost, and Torguard.\n These providers all have a no-logging policy for their regular VPN service, which relies on shared IP-addresses. However, they see dedicated IP-addresses as a separate and different service, which is treated differently anonymity-wise.\n TorGuard stresses that there are different use cases for these two options and while both are private, dedicated IP-addresses are less anonymous.\n \u201cWhen a TorGuard user buys a dedicated IP add-on we need to know that IP address in order to assign it to the right user. If that user paid us with a credit card we will have only a billing name and postal code to bill the user for services. If that same user pays us with cryptocurrency, we hold nothing but an email address and cryptocurrency transaction ID,\u201d Torguard notes.\n NordVPN says that people often choose dedicated IP-addresses to have static IPs, that could be used only by the owner to access their remote systems. These users are the only ones that have access to it, but the IP-address is linked to their account.\n \u201cIn order to provide such service, we link a specific IP to the account, there are disclaimers within our FAQ section and Help Centre articles, stating the same,\u201d NordVPN clarifies.\n VPNArea can also match a dedicated IP-address to an account holder. This includes past users until they ask for it to be removed, or once their IP-address has been put in circulation again.\n \u201cWe can match a dedicated IP to its current or past owner and we can match a timestamp of ownership by its owner, unless the owner requested their account data be deleted under GDPR,\u201d VPNArea informs us.\n The anonymity tradeoff also applies to  Trust.zone also confirmed that dedicated IP-addresses are static and can be connected to user accounts until the subscription expires. And the same is likely true for most, if not all of the other VPNs we didn\u2019t reach out to.\n CyberGhost, for example, had a similar setup. The company stands behind their no-logging approach on regular VPN connections, but up until a few weeks ago, it could connect dedicated IP-addresses to specific accounts.\n \u201cThis is a potential tradeoff when it comes to dedicated IPs. In our marketing materials, we made sure to highlight this is an add-on, and it\u2019s not meant to replace our core VPN functionality,\u201d CyberGhost notes.\n  These answers shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to the technically-minded. However, for others, who don\u2019t read the fine print, it may be a wake-up call.\n After we reached out, CyberGhost informed us that it is planning to overhaul its dedicated IP-address system to remove the association with the user account. The company plans to have this ready in August and will share more details then.\n While that change will be welcomed by some, it\u2019s not a problem if dedicated IP-address users are logged, as long as these users are aware of it. Not everyone uses a VPN for anonymity, but those who do should be aware of any potential risks. Since VPNs have become associated with anonymity, disclosing these risks is essential.\n We welcome the transparency and clarifications from the VPN providers. That\u2019s key when it comes to trust. And users should always remain critical as well. Just this week, Comparitech showed that a  breach at UFO VPN put doubt on the provider\u2019s logging claims.\n  Disclaimer: NordVPN is a TorrentFreak sponsor but this article was written independently, as all our articles are.", "posttime": "2020-07-21 08:55:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "vpn", "title": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e13\u7528VPN IP\u5730\u5740\u4e0d\u662f\u533f\u540d\u7684", "title_en": "Most Dedicated VPN IP-Addresses Are Not Anonymous", "transed": 1, "url": "https://torrentfreak.com/most-dedicated-vpn-ip-addresses-are-not-anonymous-200719/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["vpn"]}]
