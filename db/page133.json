And few fights have demonstrated this more than that against the monopoly abuses of big tech. For over a decade, the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have been able to get away with murder in digital markets without fear of consequences. Wrapping their tentacles ever more forcefully around the world economy, threatening industry upon industry with subjugation, and watching their valuations rocket into the trillions, as investors grew giddy at the sight of the spoils.  But after several false starts at the US state level, we\u2019re finally witnessing the one governing body in the US that just might be large and powerful enough to withstand the army of lobbyists, the threats of retribution, and the sheer towering presence of trillions of dollars worth of power: The United States Congress.  Five bills were introduced last week by the chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, David Cicilline, and his fellow committee members. I had actually put off reading the bills directly for several days, because I feared the usual disappointment. That these bills were going to be timid, around-the-edges, squint-to-see-silverlining type of deals. I shouldn\u2019t have. These bills are bold. Really bold.  Well, some of them. Others are more like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Like the  Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act by Neguse, which simply asks mega corporations to pay for proper inquiries into their proposed merges. Totally sensible, but not exactly defining a new epoch.  Next is the  ACCESS Act by Scanlon, which mandates interoperability for big tech, such that users can always take their data elsewhere. I think this is largely sensible, just like mandating portable phone numbers is, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly going to up-end the industry. You can already export all your emails from Gmail, yet barely anyone does. Still. Good basic consumer protection.  Then you get to the  Platform Competition and Opportunity Act by Jeffries, which is basically a ban on acquisitions for big tech. Wow. Okay, now you have my attention. You\u2019re telling me that Facebook wouldn\u2019t have been able to buy Instagram and WhatsApp, as a matter of basic law, not a prolonged merger approval inquiry? That\u2019s bold.  Next up is the  Ending Platform Monopolies Act by Jayapal. Which is essentially Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign proposal that you can\u2019t both own the market place and sell on it. That\u2019s super-duper bold. Essentially banning Amazon from carrying its own product lines on Amazon.com. But it also includes a ban on tying services, so Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to require app developers to use their in-app purchasing platform in order to list on the App Store. Or ban competitors from access to the App Store.   But I\u2019ve saved the best for last. Cicilline\u2019s own bill, which is cosponsored by republicans Ken Buck and Lance Gooden (and fellow democrat Jerry Nadler), essentially reads like a Christmas wishlist for any app developer or user of big tech. This bill has it all. It\u2019s the  American Choice and Innovation Online Act. And it\u2019s amazing.  You should go read it yourself. Hell, if you care about any of this stuff, you should read all the bills directly. They\u2019re mercifully short, relatively free of legal jargon, and strikingly bold. But anyway, here\u2019s a brief recap of the American Choice and Innovation Online Act:\n No more giving your own products and services preference if you own a dominant platform. So no more ads for Apple Arcade in your Settings app. No more hijacking all travel searches on Google to funnel travelers through their own booking services.\n No more cramming default apps that can\u2019t be uninstalled down user\u2019s throat. Remember how we just got the basic ability to set our own mail application on iOS this past summer? Yeah, it\u2019s that, but by law, applied to everything. Your own calendar app, your own messaging app, you own everything. Oh, and all those annoying preinstalled apps you don\u2019t want but the platform keeps pushing anyway now have to be uninstallable! Hurray!\n No more gag orders on developers. Apple won\u2019t be able to deny developers the right to link to their own damn website. Or tell them where to sign up for a service. Or even tell them that they have a paid service!\n NO MORE FORCING IN-APP PURCHASING ON DEVELOPERS!! The bill prevents tying the use of other services, like payment processing, to the ability to publish on the platform. All the dreaded language from Apple\u2019s App Store Guidelines with all the weird loopholes and exemptions for who is and isn\u2019t supposed to pay the 30% extortion will be illegal. Developers will have the freedom to publish on the App Store using their own payment processing (or use Apple\u2019s, should they prefer!).\n Basic protections against discrimination and retaliation. This essentially turns the app stores into common carriers. Which is an established antitrust idea of forcing platform owners to offer the same deal to everyone. Just like Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from shaking down individual websites. This bill will prevent app store platforms from shaking down individual app makers according to their whims.\n All this is backed up by the potent penalties of up to 15% of the platform owner\u2019s revenue or 30% of injured party\u2019s revenue, whichever is larger. There\u2019s some poetic justice in those rates, as they\u2019re exactly the same as the payment extortion fees demanded by Apple and Google of some app developers.  The FTC and the antitrust division\u2019s attorney general are in charge of enforcing general compliance with the law. But injured parties are also eligible to sue directly under the law. Not just for penalties and damages, but also for injunctions.  If this law had been on the books last summer, we would never have had to endure  those awful two weeks of intimidation and threats from Apple when we launched HEY. Presumably Apple wouldn\u2019t even have tried, because there would have been no  3.1.1, but even if they would have, the case to get an injunction would have been a slam dunk.  Didn\u2019t I tell you these bills were bold? If they pass Congress in anywhere near their current forms, we have a veritable revolution on our hands for the digital economy. Powerful protections against big tech abusing their monopoly advantage to shakedown individual developers and entire industries. Strong boundaries to prevent the platforms from expanding their power and marketshare even further through predatory acquisitions. Excellent consumer protections to ensure you can always get your data out, and have the choice to install your preferred default apps for all kinds of services.  But the party isn\u2019t over yet! The main enforcer of all these new bills will be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and guess who  just got confirmed as the chair of that commission?  LINA KAHN!! You seriously could not wish for a more qualified or determined enforcer of these new laws than her. She\u2019s been instrumental in shaping the modern outlook on antitrust, and moving us beyond that dreaded and outdated \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard that has allowed big tech to run roughshod over everyone else unopposed. She was a driving force behind the House Antitrust Subcommittee\u2019s series of hearings and the ultimate report on digital markets that directly lead to all these new bill proposals. She\u2019s big tech\u2019s worst nightmare and the dream chair for the rest of us.  Sure, you say, but these bills still have to pass Congress before they become law. True, but look at the sponsors for all of these bills. Each and every one of them have sponsors on both the democratic and republican side. Opposition to big tech\u2019s monopoly abuses is one of the very few truly bipartisan issues in Washington these days. I think these bills have an excellent chance to pass exactly because of that.  Taken all together, even just this promise of a chance \u2013  just one chance! \u2013 to strike at the heart of big tech and end their reign of abuse is invigorating. It\u2019s far more than I could ever have hoped for when I showed up in Colorado in January of last year to  testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. It more than makes up for the disappointment of seeing Apple and their lobbyists kill the democratic attempts at accountability at the state level.  And as if all of this wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s not like things have been quiet on the eastern front either. In Europe, the German competition authorities, called The Bundeskartellamt, just announced  they\u2019re pursuing Apple for violations of the a new January 2021 amendment to the German Competition Act. This act gives more teeth and more bite to investigating and sanctioning monopoly abusers, and Apple is the first target in their sights.   At  Basecamp, we continue to work with other competition authorities in Europe as well. Just like we\u2019ve done here in the US. Because the power of big tech is not constrained to a single country or territory. It\u2019s a global power that demands a global response. And after more than a decade of slumber on this issue, the leviathans around the globe are finally waking up, and big tech is about to meet the one real obstacle to world domination: Sovereign governments with democratic mandates.

This might be due to  inotify not being available on FreeBSD. Sublime Text 4 also has this issue. You can remedy this somewhat by using  this Sublime Text extension and manually updating the tree view.\n  The  Sublime Linter extension seems to work fine and shows errors while you are coding.\n  You also will need to restart Sublime Text when you change any settings or install any extensions for the changes to take affect.\n      Surprisingly the tree view for VSCode updates on file changes - perhaps they revert to polling when no other mechanism is available?\n    You will need to restart VSCode or reload the window from the command palette for a change in settings to take affect (again I think this is because it relies on inotify internally). Installing extensions don&#39;t  seem to need a restart.\n  The  Axe VSCode extension isn&#39;t supported on FreeBSD. Not a huge issue as I can use the browser extension and perhaps the cli tools.\n  There&#39;s a weird issue when using the VSCode debugger where it will open a duplicate version of the file the debugger/breakpoint statment is in. My fix was to switch to using  node --inspect from the command line and then using Chromium to inspect. I also installed  this Chrome extension to automatically attach and open the debugger window in Chromium.\n    I couldn&#39;t find a native GUI REST client (e.g.  Postman) for FreeBSD, but I did find REST extensions for both VSCode and Chromium which do basically the same thing:\n      These npm libraries I&#39;m currently using didn&#39;t work on FreeBSD without a fix:  trash-cli - fix: there is a python version that works fine on FreeBSD:\u00a0  pip install trash-cli --user\n  bundlesize - fix: this didnt work because it couldnt find the  python2 binary. I did have python 2.7 installed, but the binary is called   python2.7. People on the FreeBSD discord mentioned that I should just create a symlink like so:  ln -s $(which python2.7) ~/.local/bin/python2. After that bundlesize installed fine.\n  pre-commit - fix: needs to have the shebang changed in  ./node_modules/pre-commit/hook and  ./.git/hooks/pre-commit. Here&#39;s a one-liner to fix a shebang:  awk &#39;$0 = NR==1 ? replace : $0&#39; replace=&#34;\\#\\!\\/usr\\/bin\\/env bash&#34; ./.git/hooks/pre-commit &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile ./.git/hooks/pre-commit. I ended up adding the following script to my  package.json file so the scripts are fixed on install/reinstall of npm libs (task is an npm library i use for build tasks in my project):   Weirdly enough, the shebang issue has already been fixed by the pre-commit library authors, but it seems npm is hosting the old version of the file which is weird. I might open an issue to report it.\n    Geany is available on FreeBSD and is a very capable editor. It can even be used as a fairly decent Sublime Text replacement:\n  Unfortunately it doesnt have LSP support yet \ud83d\ude25. Although as an alternative,  Kate is available in ports and does have LSP support built in.\n            There is no MongoDB GUI manager in ports, although it&#39;s possible a Linux MongoDB GUI app could work on FreeBSD via Linuxulator.\n        I had a hard time finding a GUI hashing client (e.g. hash the SHA1 of a file), however I found that this windows program works just fine on FreeBSD with wine:  https://www.den4b.com/products/hasher.\n    I was fearful that either  Electron wouldn&#39;t be supported on FreeBSD or it would only support an ancient version, but as of June 23, 2020, FreeBSD has an  Electron port of Electron version 12.0.9, which is only one major release behind what is currently out \ud83d\udc4d\n      You can also create a shortcut to  DevDocs in chromium so it opens in a window and has a proper icon in the dock/taskbar. To do this, go to the file menu in Chromium, select More Tools, then Create Shortcut, and check the open in window checkbox.\n      There is a new version of the Evernote website that is very capable. You can make Evernote web have its own window and dock/taskbar icon by opening the file menu in Chromium, select More Tools, then Create Shortcut, and check the open in window checkbox.\n  If you want a keyboard shortcut to focus the Evernote window, you can use xdotool:  xdotool windowactivate $(xdotool search --name &#34;Evernote&#34;)\n        I couldn&#39;t find any GUI programs for image compression for FreeBSD, however the google squoosh app works offline, so you can just install that as a PWA with Chromium:  https://squoosh.app/\n            There are a tonne of terminals available for FreeBSD. My favourite one  Guake is available too, however the one in ports seemed to be broken for me. Installing the latest one via  pip install guake --user worked a treat.\n    There are a couple of very basic git gui clients available - eg  Gitg,  Git Cola,  QGit\n  For the moment i am using the  built in git features in VSCode. When coupled with  Git Lens, VSCode becomes a very nice Git GUI client.\n  I did manage to get  SmartGit to start by changing some things in its bash startup script (since its just a java app) but it wasn&#39;t able to use the git executable, it gave a permission denied error? - dunno what that was about\n          The latest non-LTS nodejs version available in ports is one minor version behind the latest.\n    When getting the cpu core count in Python  os.cpu_count() returns the cpu threads count and  len(os.sched_getaffinity(0)) errors as sched_getaffinity is not available on FreeBSD. However  int(os.popen(&#34;sysctl -n kern.smp.cores&#34;).read().split(&#39;\\n&#39;)[0]) returns the correct core count.    sed on BSD doesn&#39;t support every feature the Linux version supports.

", "note_en": "Singer directly addresses the court: \u2018This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good\u2019\n    Britney Spears has called for an end to the \u201cabusive\u201d conservatorship that has governed her life for 13 years, delivering an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court and saying: \u201cI just  want my life back.\u201d\n Spears addressed the court during a hearing on the unusual legal arrangement that has stripped the singer of her independence since 2008. The conservatorship has given her father, Jamie Spears,  control over her estate, career and other aspects of her personal life.\n  \u201cI want to end the  conservatorship without being evaluated,\u201d Spears said in a lengthy speech, during which she condemned her father and the others who have controlled the arrangement.\n \u201cThis conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,\u201d she said. \u201cI deserve to have a life ... I\u2019m great at what I do. All I want is to own my money \u2026 [and] share my story to the world. I want to be able to be heard.\u201d\n  Spears said she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and having a baby. She said she wanted to get her birth control removed so she could try to have another child, but that she was not allowed to go to the doctor. She said her boyfriend is also prohibited from driving her in his car, and that she is blocked from seeing some friends.\n  She directly excoriated her father, saying, \u201cHe loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%.\u201d At one point, she said, she cried for an hour on the phone and said he \u201cloved\u201d it and enjoyed having control over someone as powerful as her.\n \u201cI\u2019ve lied and told the whole world I\u2019m OK and I\u2019m happy,\u201d Spears said, adding that she wanted to sue her family. She compared her situation to \u201csex trafficking\u201d, noting that she was forced to work while having no control over her finances and no independence: \u201cThe people who did that to me should not be able to walk away so easily.\u201d\n Spears, who appeared by phone and spoke rapidly, said her management had threatened to sue her if she didn\u2019t perform in 2018: \u201cIt was very threatening and scary ... I\u2019m not here to be anyone\u2019s slave.\u201d\n She said her management falsely accused her of not taking her medication at the time. She also said the conservatorship has recently forced her to attend therapy in Westlake, where she gets bombarded by the paparazzi, and she requested that she be allowed to do therapy in her home: \u201cI deserve privacy \u2026 It\u2019s not OK to force me to do anything I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n She said she was at one point forced to take lithium, which was very strong: \u201cI felt drunk. I couldn\u2019t even have a conversation with my mom or dad really about anything ... my whole family did nothing.\u201d At the hearing, she requested that she be allowed to choose her own lawyer, and that she be permitted to speak out, noting that her parents give media interviews while she is barred from talking to press.\n \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be in a conservatorship if I can work,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe laws need to change \u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I can live a full life.\u201d\n  In a short statement at the end of the hearing, Vivian Thoreen, the attorney for Jamie Spears, said: \u201cHe is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain. Mr Spears loves his daughter and misses her very much.\u201d\n The judge, Brenda Penny, said the singer\u2019s lawyer could file a formal petition to end the conservatorship.\n  The singer\u2019s appearance was highly anticipated; the 39-year-old star almost never participates in the court proceedings, but her lawyer this year  told the judge she wanted to speak out and requested a hearing \u201con an expedited basis\u201d.\n It also comes one day after the New York Times reported on  confidential documents revealing that Spears has for years strongly objected to the conservatorship and the many powers her father has had over her.\n Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, fans had gathered hours before the hearing was due to start, wearing #FreeBritney flags and shirts and holding cardboard cutouts of the star.\n \u201cI want people to understand that this is unacceptable. This is not a gray area, he-said-she-said situation. In my view, a crime has been committed against Britney Spears,\u201d said Tess Barker, the co-host of the popular Britney\u2019s Gram podcast, who has consistently attended the singer\u2019s hearings.\n Carlos Morales, 26, who showed up with a large Britney flag, added, \u201cShe\u2019s been with me all my life. Her music is inspiration to me, and I\u2019m here to support her and pay her back.\u201d\n Fellow celebrities also voiced their support for Spears following the hearing. \u201cWe love you Britney!!! Stay strong,\u201d Mariah Carey  tweeted, while Brandy  said she was sending \u201clove and support to Britney Spears and her fans\u201d. The actor and activist  Rose McGowan; the Planned Parenthood president,  Alexis McGill Johnson; and the View co-host  Meghan McCain also spoke out on Twitter against Spears\u2019 conservatorship.\n Justin Timberlake, her former boyfriend who has faced  widespread scrutiny for the way he treated the star,  tweeted, \u201cWe should all be supporting Britney at this time \u2026 No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.\u201d\n Conservatorship is a type of  court-appointed guardianship intended for people who can no longer make decisions for themselves, typically older and infirm people. But critics have argued that the process can be exploited and have pointed to Spears\u2019s case as an example of such abuse.\n  Spears\u2019s arrangement has faced intense scrutiny in the months since the release of  Framing Britney Spears, a New York Times-produced documentary that chronicled the fraught process that led the courts to place the singer under a conservatorship. The film cast a harsh light on the abusive paparazzi and media that aggressively covered Spears\u2019s mental health challenges, and also depicted her father as being largely absent from her life until he took control of her estate amid the singer\u2019s struggles.\n A lawyer who claimed to have met with Spears in 2008 told the film-makers that she had said at the time she did not want her father as a conservator. The documentary further highlighted the apparent contradictions of her arrangement \u2013 that she could be performing sold-out shows and making millions, but also be considered incapable of making basic decisions about her health and finances.\n  Spears\u2019s lawyers, appointed by the court, filed for  Jamie to be removed as a conservator last year, alleging that the singer was \u201cafraid of her father\u201d and claiming she would not perform while he continued to exercise control of her estate. Jamie is a co-conservator of the estate alongside a corporate fiduciary, known as Bessemer Trust.\n Her father had previously acted as a personal conservator, giving him authority over her medical and mental health treatment, but a  professional licensed conservator has taken over that job.\n   The Times report on Tuesday revealed that Spears told a court investigator in 2016 that the conservatorship had \u201cbecome an oppressive and controlling tool against her\u201d and she had raised concerns that the arrangement gave her father authority over who she dated and befriended, how she designed her kitchen and how much money she was given as a weekly allowance. She also said she was forced to perform while sick with a 104F fever.\n #FreeBritney activists, who were featured in the documentary, have pushed for Jamie to be ousted and for the conservatorship to be entirely dissolved.\n \u201cI want her to be able to speak freely from her heart, and I\u2019m praying that the judge actually listens,\u201d said Junior Olivas, a #FreeBritney advocate, before the hearing. \u201cThe whole world is watching this case, and the time is now for Britney to really let them know what she wants.\u201d\n The 33-year-old longtime fan, who appeared in the documentary, has for years rallied outside the courtroom in support of the singer.\n  \u201cIn the beginning, no one paid attention or laughed us off \u2026 but finally people are paying attention and actually understanding that something is wrong here.\u201d The revelations this week added fuel to their cause, he said: \u201cShe was crying for help but nobody was listening.\u201d\n Megan Radford, another #FreeBritney advocate, noted that male celebrities have not faced the same kind of scrutiny and loss of autonomy when they have suffered public breakdowns.\n \u201cIt\u2019s dangerously stigmatizing to say someone who may or may not have mental health struggles needs to have their rights stripped away from them and reassigned to another human being,\u201d she added. The Times report, she said, made clear that the \u201cjustice system has failed Britney \u2026 She has been totally robbed of 13 years of her life for no reason.\u201d\n \u201cI watched Britney grow up. I\u2019ve been a fan since she was a teenager,\u201d said Kim Van Doorn, 45, outside the courthouse on Wednesday. Van Doorn came with her wife to LA, traveling from Bakersfield, hours north of the courthouse. \u201cI want whatever she wants for her future. But of course as a fan, I want her to continue to make music and come back as the bad Britney bitch that she is.\u201d\n Spears  appeared to endorse the #FreeBritney movement in a statement from her lawyer last year that said, \u201cBritney welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans.\u201d Her father had dismissed the campaign as a conspiracy theory.\n A representative for Jamie\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on the New York Times report on Tuesday. His attorney told reporters in February, \u201cJamie Spears has diligently and professionally carried out his duties as one of Britney\u2019s conservators, and his love for his daughter and dedication to protecting her is clearly apparent to the court.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 13:03:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6cd5\u9662,life,\u4fdd\u62a4", "title": "\u201c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u201d\uff1a\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u8981\u6c42\u6cd5\u9662\u7ec8\u6b62\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u7edf ", "title_en": "\u2018I deserve to have a life\u2019: Britney Spears asks court to end conservatorship", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/22/britney-spears-conservatorship-testimony", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6cd5\u9662", "life", "\u4fdd\u62a4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9512c53decdc81063297d46a78796d72.png", "infoid": 1067906, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u5206\u4eab\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f2b\u753b\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u5356\u6389\u5b83\u4eec\uff09\u3002 \u66f4\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u3002 ", "note_en": "This means you&#39;re free to copy and share these comics (but not to sell them).

Imagine trying to explain that to an alien or to a time traveler from the 20th century. \u201cAmazon turned 20 and on the eve of its birthday, the company introduced Prime Day, a global shopping event,\u201d reads Amazon\u2019s formal  telling of the ritual\u2019s 2015 origins. \u201cOur only goal? Offer a volume of deals greater than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members.\u201d The holiday was invented by a corporation in honor of itself, to enrich itself. It has existed for six years and is observed by tens of millions of people worldwide. I hope you are spending it with your loved ones.\n Prime Day is a singular and strange artifact, but then again, so is Prime, Amazon\u2019s $119-a-year membership service, which buys subscribers free one-day shipping, plus access to streaming media, discounts at the Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods, and a  host of other perks. Prime is Amazon\u2019s greatest and most terrifying invention: a product whose value proposition is to help you buy more products. With  200 million subscribers worldwide, it is the second-most-popular subscription service on Earth,  poised to overtake Netflix in the not-so-distant future.\n This popularity is both extremely logical and a little perplexing. When you subscribe to Prime, you\u2019re paying to pledge your fealty to a single company\u2019s ecosystem\u2014something that consumers once wanted to avoid. You\u2019re paying to have your every purchase cataloged\u2014also something consumers  aren\u2019t wild about, at least in theory\u2014so that Amazon can use that information to sell you, and people like you, more goods. You\u2019re paying to become part of a system that is purpose-built to keep you paying, forever, and to keep Amazon growing, forever, like a katamari ball or an avalanche or, in Amazon\u2019s corporate argot, a \u201c flywheel.\u201d\n A flywheel is really just a heavy wheel. Because it\u2019s so heavy, it\u2019s hard to push\u2014but once it gets spinning, all that weight helps it build momentum, and more momentum, ever faster. Low prices draw customers in, which provides Amazon with more data, more bargaining power, more market share, and more advantageous economies of scale, which then allows it to gobble up more businesses, grow its footprint, build more warehouses, increase selection, and lower prices even more\u2014which then draws even more customers in. \u201cWe look for virtuous cycles everywhere,\u201d Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s former CEO of consumer business,  said in a 2012 company meeting. \u201cThings that are complete, closed loop, and that as you inject energy into each piece of them, the flywheel spins faster and faster.\u201d The idea, he said in the meeting, was originally written on a napkin by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat napkin will eventually be in the Smithsonian Institution, I imagine,\u201d he added. It should be.\n W , in 2005, Amazon was relatively small, and still known mostly for books. As the company\u2019s former director of ordering, Vijay Ravindran,  told  Recode\u2019s Jason Del Rey in 2019, Prime \u201cwas brilliant. It made Amazon the default.\u201d It created incentives for users to be loyal to Amazon, so they could recoup the cost of membership, then $79 for unlimited two-day shipping. It also enabled Amazon to better track the products they buy and, when video streaming was added as a perk in 2011, the shows they watch, in order to make more things that the data indicated people would want to buy and watch, and to surface the things they were most likely to buy and watch at the very top of the page. And most important, Prime habituated consumers to a degree of convenience, speed, and selection that, while unheard-of just years before, was made standard virtually overnight.\n \u201cIt is genius for the current consumer culture,\u201d Christine Whelan, a clinical professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. \u201cIt encourages and then meets the need for the thing, so we then continue on the  hedonic treadmill: Buy the latest thing we want and then have it delivered immediately and then buy the next latest thing.\u201d\n  Prime\u2014especially in combination with the Amazon app\u2014makes buying just about anything as easy as possible. With traditional retail, \u201cthere\u2019s the friction of having to go to the store, there\u2019s the friction of will the store have it, there\u2019s the friction of carrying it,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cThere\u2019s the friction of having to admit to another human being that you\u2019re buying it. And when you remove the friction, you also remove a lot of individual self-control. The more you are in the ecosystem and the easier it is to make a purchase, the easier it is to say yes to your desire rather than no.\u201d According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners,  Prime members spend more than twice as much a year on Amazon purchases as non-Prime users, and more than 90 percent renew their subscription after the first year.\n This type of loyalty is remarkable. \u201cIt used to be that being a consumer was all about choice,\u201d says Emily West, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the author of the forthcoming book   Buy Now: How Amazon Branded Convenience and Normalized Monopoly. But now, \u201c two-thirds of people start their product searches on Amazon.\u201d Prime discourages comparison shopping\u2014looking around is pointless when everything you need is right here\u2014even as Amazon\u2019s sheer breadth of products makes shoppers feel as if they have agency.\n \u201cConsumerism has become a key way that people have misidentified freedom,\u201d says Jake Alimahomed-Wilson, a sociology professor at California State University at Long Beach and co-editor of   The Cost of Free Shipping: Amazon in the Global Economy. \u201cBut what Amazon represents is a corporate infrastructure that is increasingly directed at getting as many consumers as possible locked into a consumerist process\u2014an Amazon consumer for life.\u201d Amazon offers  steep discounts to college students and  new parents, two groups that are highly likely to change their buying behavior. It keeps adding more discounts and goodies to the Prime bundle, making subscribing ever more appealing. And, in an especially sinister move, it makes quitting Prime  maddeningly difficult.\n  As subscription numbers grew through the 2010s, the revenue from them helped Amazon pump more money into building fulfillment centers (to get products to people even faster), acquiring new businesses (to control even more of the global economy), and adding more perks to the bundle (to encourage more people to sign up). The market share also helped Amazon negotiate lower rates with package carriers, which further bolstered its bottom line. In 2019, Amazon shaved a full day off its delivery time, making one-day shipping the default, and also making Prime an even more tantalizing proposition: Why hop in the car for anything at all when you could get it delivered tomorrow, for free?\n A  Prime is infrastructure. It\u2019s how America shops. That was true for more than 100 million of us before the coronavirus pandemic drove the world inside, but roughly  30 million additional people in the U.S. signed up for the service last year, meaning that the United States now has  more Prime memberships than  households. In 2020, Amazon\u2019s revenue from subscriptions  alone\u2014mostly Prime\u2014was  $25.2 billion, which is a 31 percent increase from the previous year, and also about three times the revenue of the  entire NBA. The flywheel, and the hedonic treadmill, is spinning faster than ever.\n Thanks in large part to the revenue from Prime subscriptions and from the things subscribers buy, Amazon\u2019s value has multiplied roughly 97 times, to $1.76 trillion, since the service was introduced. Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the United States, after Walmart, and it is  responsible for roughly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States. (Walmart is second, with roughly 7 percent.) It controls  hundreds of millions of square feet across the country and  is opening more fulfillment centers all the time. It has acquired  dozens of other companies,  most recently the film studio MGM for $8.5 billion. Its  cloud-computing operation, Amazon Web Services, is the largest of its kind and provides the plumbing for a vast swath of the internet, to a  profit of $13.5 billion last year. Amazon has entered some 40 million American homes in the form of the Alexa smart speaker, and some 150 million American pockets in the form of the Amazon app; both, of course, make shopping for paper towels effortless and even fun, something you can do while chopping vegetables or watching television, further feeding the Amazon perpetual-motion machine.\n It is now possible to live a full, even typical, life while consuming things only from Amazon or one of its subsidiaries: grocery shopping at Whole Foods, wearing clothes bought on Shopbop and Zappos, kicking back with  The Man in the High Castle on Fire TV at night, maybe looking up the actors on IMDb as you do, before listening to an Audible book as you doze off. Amazon has been the subject of  numerous antitrust inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits\u2014most recently a lawsuit alleging that the company  punishes sellers who list their products more cheaply on other sites\u2014though none of these has yet resulted in meaningful changes to the company. The stakes are high; Amazon is now  moving aggressively into online advertising, a space currently dominated by Facebook and Google, where it will likely leverage the tremendous amount of consumer data it gleans every second from its online and brick-and-mortar storefronts to sell hyper-targeted ads.\n  \u201cAmazon is a beast we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Alimahomed-Wilson told me. \u201cAmazon powers our Zoom calls. It contracts with ICE. It\u2019s in our neighborhoods. This is a very different thing than just being a large retailer, like Walmart or the Ford Motor Company.\u201d\n Sometimes I find it useful to compare Big Tech to climate change, another force that is altering the destiny of everyone on Earth, forever. Both present themselves to us all the time in small ways\u2014a creepy ad here, an uncommonly warm November there\u2014but are so big, so abstract, so everywhere that they\u2019re impossible for any one person to really understand; to do so would be like asking a fly perched on your forehead to draw a portrait of you, or a person being engulfed by a tsunami to describe the shape of the wave. Both are the result of a decades-long, very human addiction to consumption and convenience that has been made grotesque and extreme by the incentives and mechanisms of the internet, market consolidation, and economic stratification. Both have primarily been advanced by a  small handful of  very big companies that are invested in making their machinations unseeable to the naked eye.\n Speed and convenience aren\u2019t actually free; they never are.  Free shipping isn\u2019t free either. It just obscures the real price. Getting hand sanitizer and toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles and sex toys delivered to your door, contact-free, as a contagious disease ravaged the globe didn\u2019t mean that no one was venturing into the life-threatening outside; it just meant  you weren\u2019t. Next-day shipping comes with tremendous costs: for labor and logistics and transportation and storage; for the people who pack your stuff into those smiling boxes and for the people who deliver them; for the planes and trucks and vans that carry them; for the warehouses that store them; for the software ensuring that everything really does get to your door on time, for air-conditioning and gas and cardboard and steel. Amazon\u2014Prime in particular\u2014has done a superlative job of making all those costs, all those moving parts, all those externalities invisible to the consumer.\n  Amazon warehouse workers spend their days  picking and packing in million-square-foot warehouses where they face  punishing productivity expectations,  constant surveillance,  high turnover, and  serious injuries, for a  starting wage of $15 an hour. The pandemic drove up demand for Amazon, and for labor: Last year, company profits shot up 70 percent, Bezos\u2019s personal wealth grew by  $70 billion, and  1,400 people a day joined the company\u2019s workforce.\n Amazon\u2019s warehouses bring  traffic and  pollution to the neighborhoods they\u2019re in, many of which are  poor. After products leave the warehouse, they are shipped,  at no small cost to the planet, to their destination. Sometimes they\u2019re picked up by FedEx or UPS or the post office, but because of the volume of packages and the need to deliver them next-day, many are ferried by a  network of subcontracted delivery drivers who are under intense pressure to deliver hundreds of packages a day and sometimes  hit and kill people while doing it. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. In 2019, Amazon said that reports about its delivery subcontractors \u201cdo not provide an accurate representation of Amazon\u2019s commitment to safety.\u201d It has also held that its high injury rates are the result of fastidiousness about recording injuries.)\n  Prime is the financial engine keeping Amazon\u2019s fulfillment-and-delivery machine running, and also the argument for its existence. If consumers don\u2019t expect packages in 24 hours, there\u2019s no reason to require workers to scan a new one  every 11 seconds until their discs bulge. But those expectations\u2014and their costs\u2014are bigger than Prime, or even Amazon, because Amazon is so big that every sector of our economy has bent to respond to the new way of consuming that it invented. Prime isn\u2019t just bad for Amazon\u2019s workers\u2014it\u2019s bad for Target\u2019s, and Walmart\u2019s. It\u2019s bad for the people behind the counter at your neighborhood hardware store and bookstore,  if your neighborhood still has a hardware store and a bookstore. Amazon has accustomed shoppers to a pace and manner of buying that depends on a miracle of precision logistics even when it\u2019s managed by one of the biggest companies on Earth. For the smaller guys, it\u2019s downright impossible.\n \u201cAmazon is a shadow that we can always see,\u201d Danny Caine, the owner of Raven Book Store, in Lawrence, Kansas, and the author of   How to Resist Amazon and Why, told me. \u201cEvery decision we make is based upon the fact that Amazon can get these books cheaper and faster. The prevailing expectation is you can get anything online shipped for\u201d\u2014 he scrunched his fingers into air quotes\u2014\u201c\u2018free,\u2019 in one or two days. And there\u2019s really only one company that can do that. They do that because they\u2019re willing to push and exploit their workers.\u201d\n I  like climate change, subscribing to Prime is like flying: a personal choice that pales in comparison with what government intervention could do. Just as abstaining from flying for moral reasons won\u2019t stop sea-level rise, one person canceling Prime won\u2019t do much of anything to a multinational corporation\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically insignificant to Amazon. They\u2019ll never feel it,\u201d Caine told me. But, he said, \u201cthe small businesses in your neighborhood will absolutely feel the addition of a new customer. Individual choices do make a big difference to them.\u201d\n  And in the case of Prime, what you and the world are paying for isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Bali or a weekend with Grandma; it\u2019s the right to get Command hooks delivered to your house in 12 hours. Whelan teaches a class at UW called Consuming Happiness, and she is fond of giving her students the adage that you can buy happiness\u2014\u201cif you spend your money in keeping with your values: spending prosocially, on experiences. Tons of research shows us this.\u201d\n Prime, she told me, clearly fails that test. Abstaining from flying for moral reasons\u2014and there are many\u2014cuts you off from some of the most important experiences of modern life. Abstaining from Prime for moral reasons\u2014and there are many\u2014returns you to a life you probably had less than a decade ago: going to the store, standing in line, lugging your bags on the train or up the stairs.\n Prime\u2019s neatest trick was making that life unimaginable. It has hastened the decline of the local small businesses we\u2019d be shopping at if Amazon didn\u2019t exist, and it has bought up so many other companies that even if you avoid Amazon.com, you\u2019re probably still shopping at Amazon. It has rewired the way Americans think about what is possible to have, and how fast. It has placed all of us atop the flywheel. Some small number of us may emerge from the pandemic and realize we don\u2019t need to be here. But many more\u2014especially those with children, those living in rural areas, those with disabilities, those who work long hours\u2014are stuck, running ever faster. I asked Whelan, who has three kids under 10, if she\u2019d ever consider canceling Prime, given what she knows about how it short-circuits the consumer brain. She paused for a beat, then told me no. \u201cAmazon is the service that keeps our life moving.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 12:18:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u7d20\u6570,prime,\u8d2d\u4e70", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7d20\u6570\u662f\u7f3a\u9677\u7684 ", "title_en": "Amazon Prime Day Is Dystopian", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/amazon-prime-day-dystopian/619265/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u7d20\u6570", "prime", "\u8d2d\u4e70"]}]
