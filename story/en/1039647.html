The previously unreported cases show how the OCC under Trump quietly held back from punishing banks for abuses, while the administration sought more broadly to loosen banking rules and other consumer financial protections.</p><p>  在某些情况下，OCC官员否决了想要对该银行处以罚款的前线审查员。此前未报道的案件表明，特朗普领导下的OCC如何悄悄地阻止对银行的滥用行为进行惩罚，而政府更广泛地寻求放松银行规则和其他消费者金融保护措施。 </p><p>  Brian Brooks, a former bank executive, has led the OCC on a temporary basis since May; last month, the  president nominated Brooks to a full, five-year term.</p><p>自五月以来，前银行高管布莱恩·布鲁克斯（Brian Brooks）暂时领导了OCC。上个月，总统提名布鲁克斯任满五年。</p><p>  Brooks and his predecessor at the OCC, Joseph Otting, both helped run OneWest Bank, a lender that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin founded in the aftermath of the 2009 financial crisis.</p><p>  布鲁克斯和他在OCC的前任约瑟夫·奥廷（Joseph Otting）都曾帮助运营OneWest银行，这是美国财政部长史蒂夫·努钦（Steve Mnuchin）在2009年金融危机后成立的银行。</p><p>  Banks found to have charged excessive overdraft fees and other faulty charges include Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase, American Express and U.S. Bank and large regional lenders such as Zions Bank, Union Bank and First Horizon.</p><p>  被发现收取了过多的透支费和其他错误的费用的银行包括摩根大通，美国运通和美国银行等华尔街巨头以及锡安银行，联合银行和First Horizo​​n等大型区域性贷方。</p><p>  An OCC spokesman said the agency would not comment on the specific instances cited in this story because such matters are confidential. The OCC has a range of tools to police bank misconduct, the spokesman said.</p><p>  OCC发言人表示，该机构将不会对此故事中引用的具体实例发表评论，因为此类事件属于机密。发言人说，OCC提供了一系列工具来监视银行的不当行为。</p><p>    “It is frequently the case that deficiencies can be corrected much more quickly — including correcting harm to customers — by using supervisory tools,” said spokesman Bryan Hubbard, referring to confidential sanctions. “Most importantly, the absence of a public penalty does not indicate a lack of action.”</p><p>    发言人布莱恩·哈伯德（Bryan Hubbard）谈到机密制裁时说：“通常情况下，可以使用监督工具来纠正缺陷（包括纠正对客户的伤害）更快得多。” “最重要的是，没有公共处罚并不表示没有采取行动。”</p><p>  A bank might be cited first with a confidential sanction and later punished openly, Hubbard said. “Our actions may or may not be complete.”</p><p>  哈伯德说，银行可能会首先受到保密制裁，然后被公开处罚。 “我们的行动可能会或可能不会完成。”</p><p>  Big banks collect over $11 billion in overdraft-related fees each year,  according to a report from the Center for Responsible Lending, which found in a study that punitive bank fees often hit vulnerable customers the hardest.</p><p>  负责借贷中心（Center for Responsible Lending）的一份报告显示，大银行每年收取与透支相关的费用超过110亿美元，该报告在一项研究中发现，惩罚性银行费用通常对弱势客户的打击最大。 </p><p>  Overdraft policies vary by bank but the typical fee is $35, and a customer can accrue additional penalties multiple times a day, CRL reported. Banks could simply decline a charge if a customer lacked the funds, but instead lenders promote “overdraft protection” as a convenience that comes at a cost. For customers whose accounts often hover near zero, that convenience is just another snare in a financial trap, said Rebecca Bourné, a CRL lawyer who worked on the study.</p><p>CRL报告称，透支政策因银行而异，但通常的费用为35美元，客户一天可多次遭受额外罚款。如果客户缺乏资金，银行可以简单地拒绝收取费用，但放款人则提倡“透支保护”，这是有代价的便利。从事这项研究的CRL律师丽贝卡·鲍恩（RebeccaBourné）表示，对于那些经常将帐户徘徊在零附近的客户来说，便利只是财务陷阱中的另一个陷阱。</p><p>  “Imagine you struggled to buy groceries over the weekend and you wake up Monday to $100 in overdraft fees,” Bourné said. “That happens to people who can least afford to pay.”</p><p>  Bourné说：“想象一下，您在周末很难买到杂货，而您周一醒来却透支了100美元的手续费。” “这发生在那些最无力支付的人身上。”</p><p>  Chase had promised some online customers that they would get an alert before their accounts went negative, but the bank told the OCC that did not happen as roughly 170,000 accounts dwindled to zero, according to industry and regulatory officials. Chase  charges $34 for an overdraft and allows three such charges a day on an account with insufficient funds. A customer could be charged as much as $102 per day.</p><p>  大通银行曾向一些在线客户承诺，他们将在其账户转为负数之前收到警报，但据行业和监管机构官员称，该行并未向OCC表示，因为大约有170,000个账户减少到了零。 Chase收取透支费用$ 34，并且每天在资金不足的帐户中允许三笔这样的费用。每天可能向客户收取102美元的费用。</p><p>  Chase, which operates nearly 5,000 locations nationwide, reported the faulty auto alerts to the OCC as required, but the problem had stayed out of public view until now.</p><p>  大通在全国有近5,000个地点，在需要时向OCC报告了错误的自动警报，但直到现在，这个问题一直没有引起公众注意。</p><p>  “We found that some customers were not receiving some account alerts due to a systems issue in 2018,” Chase spokesman Michael Fusco said. “We have fixed the issue, proactively notified and reimbursed affected customers.”</p><p>  大通银行发言人迈克尔·富斯科说：“我们发现，由于2018年系统出现问题，一些客户没有收到一些帐户警报。” “我们已经解决了这个问题，主动通知并补偿了受影响的客户。”</p><p>    Chase had roughly 52 million active digital customers at the end of last year, according to  securities filings, and that figure has grown by millions each year over the last several years.</p><p>    根据证券备案，截至去年年底，Chase大约有5200万活跃数字客户，并且在过去几年中，这一数字每年以百万计的速度增长。</p><p>  In interviews, several bank branch employees working in different parts of the country said Chase could have easily underestimated the number of customers who were impacted, based on the number of complaints they heard.</p><p>  在接受采访时，在该国不同地区工作的几家银行分行员工表示，大通根据听到的投诉数量很容易低估了受影响的客户数量。 </p><p>  Chase insists its remediation work was reliable. “We completed a thorough review of all accounts and identified the impacted customers,” said Fusco.</p><p>大通坚持认为其修复工作是可靠的。 Fusco说：“我们完成了对所有帐户的彻底审查，并确定了受影响的客户。”</p><p>  Under the agreement between Chase and the OCC, the bank agreed to refund customers that it believes were wrongly charged, but with no outside, independent check on the work, officials said.</p><p>  官员说，根据大通银行与华侨城公司的协议，该银行同意退还认为错误收费的客户，但没有外界独立的工作支票。</p><p>  The Chase matter shows how faulty overdraft policies can take hold at a bank and weigh on customers.</p><p>  追逐案表明，错误的透支政策如何在银行中紧握并压制客户。</p><p>  Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., has in recent years pushed the bank’s online presence and a corporate mantra “ Mobile first, digital everything.” Chase encourages consumers to find a screen and open their own Total Checking accounts.</p><p>  摩根大通（JPMorgan Chase＆amp; amp; amp;）首席执行官杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）近年来，该公司一直在推动银行的在线业务和“移动至上，数字化一切”的企业口号。大通银行鼓励消费者寻找一个屏幕并开设自己的全面检查账户。</p><p>  With a few clicks, a new Chase customer can choose to receive an account alert for everything from low balances to suspicious transactions. Customers who rely on online banking might rarely have cause to visit a Chase branch.</p><p>  只需单击几下，新的Chase客户就可以选择接收帐户警报，从余额低到可疑交易的所有内容。依赖在线银行的客户很少会拜访大通分行。</p><p>  But customers did come knocking when their auto alerts failed and they were hit with surprise overdrafts and other penalties, said current and former employees interviewed by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum.</p><p>  但是，ProPublica和Capitol论坛采访的现任和前任雇员表示，当汽车警报失败时，客户确实敲门了，他们被透支透支和其他罚款所打击。</p><p>  Chase customers had complained about faulty auto alerts for more than 12 months when the bank brought the issue to the OCC late last year, according to regulatory officials and agency paperwork.</p><p>  监管官员和机构文书显示，去年底该银行将问题提交给OCC时，Chase客户抱怨汽车警报错误超过12个月。 </p><p>  Chase insisted that the error was just a coding hiccup and that the fix was manageable, but some OCC officials believed the bank still deserved punishment since so many customers were hurt.</p><p>蔡斯坚持认为，该错误只是一个编码问题，并且可以解决该问题，但OCC的一些官员认为，由于许多客户受到伤害，该银行仍应受到惩罚。</p><p>  To some front-line examiners, the faulty alert program amounted to an “unfair and deceptive” practice that could draw a public penalty under the law.</p><p>  对于某些一线审查员来说，错误的警报程序相当于一种“不公平和欺骗性”的做法，可能会依法受到公共处罚。</p><p>    Nguyen joined the OCC in June 2018 as a deputy to Otting, then Trump’s OCC chief, and Nguyen had a large role in managing one of Otting’s top priorities: rewriting the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to lend in poor neighborhoods.</p><p>    Nguyen于2018年6月加入OCC，担任Otting的副手，然后是特朗普的OCC负责人，Nguyen在管理Otting的最优先事项之一方面发挥了重要作用：重写《社区再投资法》，该法要求银行在贫困社区贷款。</p><p>  Otting presented the new CRA in May and stepped down a day later. The CRA rewrite will make it easier for banks to pull back from serving poor neighborhoods, according to several consumer-advocacy groups that are challenging the move in court.</p><p>  Otting于5月提出了新的CRA，并于一天后辞职。几家在法庭上提出质疑的消费者权益保护组织表示，CRA的重写将使银行更容易退出为贫困社区服务的计划。</p><p>  When the Chase matter reached Nguyen’s desk, he agreed that the bank had been deceptive, but he ruled that no penalty was warranted, according to regulatory paperwork.</p><p>  根据监管文件，当Chase案到达Nguyen的案头时，他同意该银行具有欺骗性，但他裁定不对任何行为处以罚款。</p><p>  For one thing, Chase had stepped forward to admit the problem. Regulators can give banks credit for policing themselves, and Nguyen decided that would hold true in the Chase matter, regulatory officials said.</p><p>  一方面，大通已经上前承认这一问题。监管人员说，监管机构可以因监管自己而给银行以信誉，阮晋伟认为这在追逐事件中将成立。</p><p>  Nguyen did agree to record the incident in the supervisory letter added to the bank’s confidential file. Nguyen declined to comment and referred questions to the OCC.</p><p>  Nguyen确实同意在添加到该银行机密文件中的监管函中记录该事件。 Nguyen拒绝置评，并将问题转交给OCC。 </p><p>  Supervisory letters are one of the mildest rebukes that the OCC can issue, and critics say the letters have negligible impact.</p><p>监督信是OCC可以发出的最温和的谴责之一，批评家说这些信的影响可以忽略不计。</p><p>  After Wells Fargo admitted in 2016 that its employees created fake accounts to hit skyhigh sales goals, the OCC found that it had been  issuing supervisory letters for seven years warning the bank about its sales practices.</p><p>  富国银行（Wells Fargo）在2016年承认其员工创建了虚假账户以达到高销售目标后，OCC发现其已经发出监督信长达7年，警告该银行其销售行为。</p><p>  Lawyers from the OCC and Chase worked together to write the final language of the supervisory letter in which the bank insisted that it did nothing wrong, according to regulatory officials.</p><p>  监管官员说，OCC和大通银行的律师共同编写了监管函的最终语言，该监管银行在信中坚持认为它没有做错任何事情。</p><p>  Notably, said the officials, the OCC handled the matter itself and without help from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an agency created to ensure that financial firms do not mistreat ordinary customers.</p><p>  官员们说，值得注意的是，OCC自行处理此事，没有得到消费者金融保护局（Consumer Financial Protection Bureau）的帮助。消费者金融保护局是为了确保金融公司不会虐待普通客户而成立的。</p><p>  “It would not have gone down well if the OCC did not involve us in a consumer matter,” said Richard Cordray, the first CFPB director who served President Barack Obama.</p><p>  “为OCC不让我们参与消费者事务，情况不会很好。”为总统巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）服务的第一位CFPB总监理查德·科德雷（Richard Cordray）说。</p><p>  Cordray said that he would not second-guess any regulator’s decision about sanctions without knowing the facts, but that the Trump administration had clearly shown it was not eager to sanction bank wrongdoing.</p><p>  科尔德雷表示，在不知道事实的情况下，他不会对任何监管机构对制裁的决定进行第二次猜测，但特朗普政府已经清楚地表明，它并不渴望制裁银行的不法行为。</p><p>  “These are different times and different leaders,” he said, “but the OCC and CFPB used to take aggressive action together when we saw consumers being hurt.”</p><p>  他说：“这些时代是不同的时代，领导者也不同。但是，当消费者受到伤害时，OCC和CFPB曾经一起采取激进的行动。” </p><p>    Dubious disclosures and lax enforcement are part of many overdraft abuses, said Bourné of the CRL, and they were a problem in the incidents handled by the OCC. American Express, the credit card giant, also offers  short-term loans that are supposed to be repaid in regular monthly installments. Customers pay interest on the loan, of course, but American Express never explained that customers who missed a payment could also be charged interest on late fees and bounced checks, the OCC concluded. That was unfair and deceptive, OCC examiners determined in recent months, but the agency’s chiefs decided to hand the bank a quiet reprimand rather than a public sanction.</p><p>CRL的Bourné说，可疑的信息披露和执法不严是许多透支滥用行为的一部分，这是OCC处理的事件中的一个问题。信用卡巨头美国运通（American Express）还提供应该按月定期分期偿还的短期贷款。 OCC总结说，客户当然要为贷款支付利息，但美国运通公司从未解释说，错过付款的客户也可能要支付滞纳金和支票退回的利息。 OCC审查员在最近几个月确定这是不公平和欺骗性的，但该机构的负责人决定向银行悄悄谴责，而不是公开制裁。</p><p>  “Due to a technical error, some personal loan customers were incorrectly charged,” American Express said in a statement. The firm said it will now notify customers and issue credits for undue fees. American Express declined to say how many customers were affected but said the charges were generally less than $1 each.</p><p>  美国运通在一份声明中说：“由于技术失误，一些个人贷款客户被错误地收取了费用。”该公司表示，现在将通知客户并发放不当费用的信用额。美国运通拒绝透露有多少客户受到影响，但表示收费一般每人不到1美元。</p><p>  Seven years ago, U.S. Bank unveiled a novel credit card program that the bank said could reduce costs for many customers.  FlexControl Essentials promised to let customers first pay off everyday purchases — like gasoline and groceries — which the bank said could lower the monthly bill.</p><p>  七年前，美国银行推出了一项新颖的信用卡计划，该银行表示可以降低许多客户的费用。 FlexControl Essentials承诺让客户首先还清日常购买的物品，例如汽油和杂货。该银行表示，这可以降低每月的账单。</p><p>  But customers of U.S. Bank, the nation’s fifth-largest lender, were baffled by the Byzantine system used to determine what was an “everyday” purchase and how much money they actually owed, according to several current and former bank employees.</p><p>  但是，据目前和以前的几名银行雇员称，美国第五大银行美国银行的客户对用来确定什么是“日常”购买以及他们实际欠了多少钱的拜占庭系统感到困惑。</p><p>  U.S. Bank knew FlexControl Essentials was balky, and the bank spent five years trying to improve it before retiring the offer in 2018, the year the OCC took notice, according to bank and regulatory officials.</p><p>  银行和监管机构官员说，美国银行知道FlexControl Essentials太笨拙，并且该银行花了五年时间对其进行改进，然后在2018年（OCC注意到这一年）取消报价。</p><p>  Within the OCC, some officials thought FlexControl Essentials was more than just a credit card program gone awry — it was a consumer abuse. For several weeks in early 2018, OCC lawyers debated next steps and whether they should dig deeper into how many customers might have been hurt, according to enforcement paperwork and two officials involved.</p><p>  在OCC内部，一些官员认为FlexControl Essentials不仅仅是信用卡程序出错了-它是对消费者的滥用。根据执法文件和两名相关官员的说法，在2018年初的几周内，OCC律师辩论了下一步措施以及是否应该更深入地调查可能伤害了多少客户。</p><p>  By the summer of 2018, though, the OCC decided to let the bank quietly scrap the program without paying a fine or facing a public sanction, according to regulatory sources.</p><p>  不过，据监管机构消息称，到2018年夏季，OCC决定让该银行悄悄取消该计划，而无需支付罚款或面临公共制裁。 </p><p>  In a statement, U.S. Bank declined to comment on the FlexControl Essentials program except to say it was retired in 2018. “Customers continue to have great flexibility with our products and we appreciate their continued support,” the bank said.</p><p>在一份声明中，美国银行拒绝对FlexControl Essentials计划发表评论，只是说该计划已于2018年退休。“客户在我们的产品上继续拥有极大的灵活性，我们感谢他们的不断支持，”该银行表示。</p><p>  Three years before Chase grappled with errors in the auto alert program, the bank had to face a separate problem that was costing customers.</p><p>  在大通解决自动警报程序中的错误之前的三年，该银行不得不面对一个单独的问题，该问题使客户付出了代价。</p><p>    Banks are expected to clear checks within a “ reasonable period of time,” which in many instances means two days. But under the rules, the wait can stretch for a week or more. Ultimately, banks not only decide when to clear a check but whether to clear it at all and how much a check is even worth.</p><p>    预计银行会在“合理的时间段”内结清支票，在许多情况下，这意味着两天。但是根据规则，等待时间可能会长达一周或更长时间。最终，银行不仅决定何时结清支票，还决定是否结清支票以及什至值得支票多少。</p><p>    That was the issue in 2017 when bank examiners found flaws in Chase’s handling of checks that had stray markings, sloppy handwriting or were otherwise deemed illegible. Banks can take extra time to examine those checks and ultimately even decide what the checks are worth.</p><p>    这就是2017年的问题，当时银行检查员发现大通银行处理的支票存在缺陷，这些支票带有斑驳的标记，草率的笔迹或被认为难以辨认。银行可能会花费更多时间检查这些支票，甚至最终决定这些支票的价值。</p><p>  OCC examiners found that Chase customers were sometimes shortchanged and some agency officials wanted to openly sanction the bank, according to regulatory officials. In the end, Chase was allowed to push the issue aside with no penalty by the end of 2017.</p><p>  监管官员说，OCC审查员发现，Chase客户有时会变卖，有些代理商官员想公开制裁该银行。最终，蔡斯被允许在2017年底之前将这一问题搁置一旁，而不会受到任何处罚。</p><p>  In a statement, Chase said that the bank identified the problem itself in 2017 and then “worked quickly to resolve it and have since credited all impacted customers.”</p><p>  蔡斯在一份声明中说，该银行在2017年自行发现了问题，然后“迅速解决了这一问题，并已将所有受影响的客户都归功于此。”</p><p>  Taken together with the faulty auto alerts program from this year, Chase was twice found to have wrongly charged customers but faced no public penalty.</p><p>  从今年开始，由于错误的自动警报程序，大通被两次发现对客户的指控是错误的，但没有受到公共处罚。 </p><p>  Banks ultimately control the sequence of deposits and withdrawals in a way that can boost corporate profits. A bank customer who exceeds their balance in the morning and replenishes the account by sundown might still incur an overdrawn account fee.</p><p>银行最终以可以提高企业利润的方式控制存款和取款的顺序。早晨超出余额并通过日落补充帐户的银行客户可能仍会产生透支的帐户费用。</p><p>  Another customer who overdraws an account with one costly purchase — a sofa — might be charged a fee for that item plus all the other miscellaneous purchases they made that day from a gas fill-up to a cup of coffee.</p><p>  另一位因一笔昂贵的购买而透支帐户的客户（一张沙发）可能要为此物品收取费用，以及他们当天从加气到一杯咖啡所进行的所有其他杂项购买。</p><p>  Bank regulators allow some maneuvers as long as they are disclosed to the customer, but at least three banks in recent years were deemed to have wrongly snared customers in how they added and subtracted money from an account, according to regulatory and industry officials.</p><p>  监管机构和行业官员称，银行监管机构只要向客户披露信息就可以进行某些操作，但近年来，至少有三家银行被误导了客户在帐户中增值和减值的方式。</p><p>  One offender was Zions Bank, the largest lender in Utah, which tucked three separate, fee-generating schemes into murky disclosures, according to OCC officials who tracked the matter for more than a year.</p><p>  OCC官员跟踪了此事一年多，据此，其中一个罪犯是犹他州最大的银行Zions Bank，该银行将三个单独的收费计划纳入了模糊的披露中。</p><p>  Zions Bank customers who pushed their accounts into negative territory with a single purchase were charged a $32 penalty for that one buy and then the same fee for every other purchase made that day, examiners found.</p><p>  审查员发现，单次购买将帐户推入负数区域的Zions银行客户将被罚款32美元，然后在当天进行的其他每次购买均收取相同的费用。</p><p>  Zions Bank customers also could get charged many overdraft fees for being just a few bucks short, examiners agreed. The third abuse was that Zions Bank charged a daily overdraft penalty on top of individual purchase penalties, regulatory officials said.</p><p>  审查员同意，锡安银行的客户也可能因短短几美元而被收取许多透支费。监管人员说，第三个弊端是，锡安斯银行除了个人购买罚款外，还每天收取透支罚款。</p><p>  At the heart of every Zions Bank infraction was faulty disclosures and that customers did not know they had a right to opt out of any overdraft program — a step that might mean more rejected charges for the customer but also fewer surprise fees, according to the enforcement officials.</p><p>  每次Zions银行违规行为的核心都是错误的披露信息，客户不知道自己有权选择退出任何透支计划-根据执行情况，这一步骤可能意味着向客户收取的费用更高，但意外费用也更少官员。 </p><p>  The OCC determined that Zions Bank ran afoul of a 2010 banking rule that explicitly required banks to get customer consent before enrolling them in overdraft protection, according to two regulatory officials with firsthand knowledge of the matter.</p><p>两名了解此事的第一手监管人员称，OCC确定Zions银行违反了2010年银行业规则，该规则明确要求银行在将客户加入透支保护之前必须获得客户同意。</p><p>  In a statement, Zions Bank said it always abides by the law requiring a customer “opt in” for overdraft protection.</p><p>  锡安银行（Zions Bank）在一份声明中表示，它始终遵守法律要求客户“选择加入”以提供透支保护。</p><p>  “Zions Bank is committed to maintaining the highest standards of fair and transparent customer services,” the bank said in a statement.</p><p>  该银行在一份声明中说：“锡安银行致力于保持最高标准的公平和透明的客户服务。”</p><p>  The Zions Bank abuses matched tactics at Union Bank, a leading lender in the west, according to industry and regulatory officials familiar with the matter. Union Bank was charging customers overdraft fees despite the customer having a positive balance at the end of the day, according to the officials. The problem had been going on for years when it came to the attention of bank examiners in 2017, but rather than sanction the bank publicly, the OCC filed a supervisory letter, according to regulatory sources.</p><p>  熟悉此事的业内人士和监管人员称，锡安银行的滥用行为与西方领先的联合银行联合银行的策略相符。官员们表示，联合银行向客户收取透支费用，尽管该客户最终收支平衡。根据监管消息来源，OCC在2017年引起银行审查员注意的问题已经持续多年，但OCC并未公开制裁银行，而是提交了监管函。</p><p>    First Horizon, a leading lender in the south, came to the OCC last year to report problems with its own overdraft program, according to industry and regulatory officials.</p><p>    根据行业和监管官员的说法，南方领先的贷方First Horizo​​n去年来到OCC报告其透支计划存在的问题。</p><p>  The bank had wrongly charged customers overdraft fees when they went into the red for a few hours but ended the day with a positive balance, according to enforcement officials, and that practice ran contrary to the bank’s marketing and disclosure documents.</p><p>  据执法人员称，该银行误收客户数小时的透支费，但当天收支平衡为正，这种做法与该行的营销和披露文件背道而驰。</p><p>  By the time the problem was detected, it had gone on for at least two years, although the bank promised to make customers whole, according to regulatory and industry officials.</p><p>  据监管部门和行业官员称，到问题被发现时，问题已经持续了至少两年，尽管该银行承诺让客户满意。 </p><p>  The OCC opted not to punish the bank publicly and instead issued a private reprimand, regulatory officials said.</p><p>监管官员说，OCC选择不公开惩罚该银行，而是发布私人谴责。</p><p>  In a statement, First Horizon acknowledged the issue and said it tapped an outside consultant to manage customer refunds.</p><p>  First Horizo​​n在一份声明中承认了该问题，并表示已聘请外部顾问来管理客户退款。</p><p>  “The issue was corrected and our impacted customers were notified and refunded,” the bank said in a statement.</p><p>  该银行在一份声明中说：“问题已得到纠正，我们受影响的客户已得到通知并退款。”</p><p>  Do you have access to information about bank regulation and enforcement that should be public?

We were founded over 10 years ago to fill a growing hole in journalism: Newsrooms were (and still are) shrinking, and legacy funding models are failing. Deep-dive reporting like ours is slow and expensive, and investigative journalism is a luxury in many newsrooms today — but it remains as critical as ever to democracy and our civic life. More than a decade (and six Pulitzer Prizes) later, ProPublica has built the largest investigative newsroom in the country. Our work has spurred reform through legislation, at the voting booth and inside our nation’s most important institutions.</p><p>  ProPublica是一个非营利性新闻编辑室，其产生的无党派，循证新闻报道揭露了不公正，腐败和不法行为。我们成立于10年前，目的是填补新闻业中越来越大的空缺：新闻编辑室正在（并且仍在）不断缩小，而传统的融资模式正在失败。像我们这样的深度报道速度缓慢且昂贵，而调查新闻在当今许多新闻编辑室中是一种奢侈，但它对民主和我们的公民生活仍然至关重要。十多年来（和六次普利策奖），ProPublica建立了该国最大的调查新闻编辑室。我们的工作通过立法，投票站和美国最重要的机构内部推动了改革。</p><p>  Your year-end donation will help us ensure that we can continue this critical work into 2021.
