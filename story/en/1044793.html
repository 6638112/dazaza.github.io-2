Taxes were high. Your neighbors didn’t like you. If you lived in San Francisco, you might have commuted an hour south to your job at Apple or Google or Facebook. Or if your office was in the city, maybe it was in a neighborhood with too much street crime, open drug use and $5 coffees.</p><p>租金是天文数字。税收很高。你的邻居不喜欢你。如果您居住在旧金山，则可能要在苹果，谷歌或Facebook上工作一个小时以南。或者，如果您的办公室在城市，则可能是在街头犯罪过多，使用毒品和5美元咖啡的街区。</p><p>  But it was worth it. Living in the epicenter of a boom that was changing the world was what mattered. The city gave its workers a choice of interesting jobs and a chance at the brass ring.</p><p>  但它是值得的。重要的是，生活在改变世界的繁荣的震中。这座城市给工人提供了很多有趣的工作，并为他们提供了一个机会。</p><p>    That is, until the pandemic. Remote work offered a chance at residing for a few months in towns where life felt easier. Tech workers and their bosses realized they might not need all the perks and after-work schmooze events. But maybe they needed elbow room and a yard for the new puppy. A place to put the Peloton. A top public school.</p><p>    也就是说，直到大流行。远程工作提供了在生活更轻松的城镇中居住几个月的机会。科技工作者和他们的老板意识到他们可能不需要所有的津贴和下班后的混乱事件。但是也许他们需要肘部空间和新来的小狗院子。放置细气管球的地方。顶尖的公立学校。</p><p>    They fled. They fled to tropical beach towns. They fled to more affordable places like Georgia. They fled to states without income taxes like Texas and Florida.</p><p>    他们逃走了。他们逃到热带海滩小镇。他们逃到佐治亚州等负担得起的地方。他们逃到了没有所得税的州，如德克萨斯州和佛罗里达州。</p><p>  That’s where the story of the Bay Area’s latest tech era is ending for a growing crowd of tech workers and their companies. They have suddenly movable jobs and money in the bank — money that will go plenty further somewhere else.</p><p>  在那里，随着越来越多的技术工人及其公司，海湾地区最新技术时代的故事就此结束。他们突然有了可移动的工作和银行里的钱-这些钱会在其他地方走得更远。</p><p>   But where? The No. 1 pick for people leaving San Francisco is Austin, Texas, with other winners including Seattle, New York and Chicago, according to moveBuddha, a site that compiles data on moving. Some cities have set up recruiting programs to lure them to new homes. Miami’s mayor has been inviting tech people to move there in his Twitter posts.</p><p>   但是哪里？搜集移动数据的网站moveBuddha称，离开旧金山的人的第一选择是德克萨斯州的奥斯丁，其他赢家包括西雅图，纽约和芝加哥。一些城市已经制定了招募计划，以吸引他们进入新家。迈阿密市长一直在他的Twitter帖子中邀请技术人员搬到那里。</p><p>   I talked to more than two dozen tech executives and workers who have left San Francisco for other parts of the country over the past year, like a young entrepreneur who moved home to Georgia and another who has created a community in Puerto Rico. Here are some of their stories.</p><p>   我与过去十二年来离开旧金山前往美国其他地区的二十多名技术主管和工人进行了交谈，例如一位年轻的企业家搬到了佐治亚州，以及另​​一位在波多黎各建立了社区的企业家。这是他们的一些故事。 </p><p>         “I miss San Francisco. I miss the life I had there,” said John Gardner, 35, the founder and CEO of Kickoff, a remote personal training startup, who packed his things into storage and left in a camper van to wander America. “But right now it’s just like: What else can God and the world and government come up with to make the place less livable?”</p><p>“我想念旧金山。我想念我在那里的生活，”现年35岁的约翰·加德纳（John Gardner）说，这是一家偏远的私人培训创业公司Kickoff的创始人兼首席执行官，他将自己的东西装进储藏室，然后放到露营车中游荡在美国。 “但是现在就像：上帝以及世界和政府还能想出些什么来使这个地方不宜居？”</p><p>   A couple of months later, Gardner wrote: “Greetings from sunny Miami Beach! This is about the 40th place I’ve set up a temporary headquarters for Kickoff.”</p><p>   几个月后，加德纳写道：“来自阳光明媚的迈阿密海滩的问候！这是我为开赛设立了临时总部的第40位。”</p><p>  Remote personal training happens to coincide well with remote life, but he said his startup’s growth this past year was also due to his leaving the tech bubble and immersing himself in more normal communities, a few days at a time.</p><p>  远程个人培训恰好与远程生活相吻合，但是他说，他的创业公司在过去一年中的成长还归因于他离开了技术泡沫，一次又一次地沉浸在更普通的社区中。</p><p>    The biggest tech companies aren’t going anywhere, and tech stocks are still soaring. Apple’s flying-saucer-shaped campus is not going to zoom away. Google is still absorbing ever more office space in San Jose and San Francisco. New founders are still coming to town.</p><p>    规模最大的科技公司无处可去，科技股仍在飙升。苹果的飞碟形校园不会消失。 Google仍在吸收圣何塞和旧金山的更多办公空间。新的创始人仍在城里。</p><p>  But the migration from the Bay Area appears real. Residential rents in San Francisco are down 27% from a year ago, and the office vacancy rate has spiked to 16.7%, a number not seen in a decade.</p><p>  但是从湾区的迁移看来是真实的。旧金山的住宅租金比一年前下降了27％，办公室的空置率飙升至16.7％，这是十年来的最高水平。</p><p>  Though prices had dropped only slightly, Zillow reported more homes for sale in San Francisco than a year ago. For more than a month last year, 90% of the searches involving San Francisco on moveBuddha were for people moving out.</p><p>  尽管价格仅略有下降，但Zillow报告说旧金山的待售房屋比一年前多。去年一个多月以来，moveBuddha上涉及旧金山的搜索中有90％是针对搬出的人。</p><p>  Twitter, Yelp, Airbnb and Dropbox have tried to sublease some of their San Francisco office space. Pinterest, which has one of the most iconic offices in town, paid $90 million to break a lease for a site where it planned to expand. And companies like Twitter and Facebook have announced “work from home forever” plans.</p><p>  Twitter，Yelp，Airbnb和Dropbox试图转租他们在旧金山的一些办公空间。 Pinterest是该镇最具标志性的办事处之一，斥资9000万美元打破了计划扩建场地的租约。 Twitter和Facebook等公司已经宣布了“永远在家工作”计划。 </p><p>  “Moving into a $1.3 million house that we saw only on video for 20 minutes and said yes,” wrote Mike Rothermel, a designer at Cisco who moved from the Bay Area to Boulder, Colorado, with his wife last summer. “It’s a mansion compared to SF for the same money.”</p><p>思科的设计师迈克·罗瑟梅尔（Mike Rothermel）去年夏天与妻子从海湾地区搬到科罗拉多州的博尔德，他说：“搬进一栋130万美元的房子，我们只能在视频上看到20分钟，然后同意。” “与SF相比，这是一栋豪宅，但价格相同。”</p><p>  The amount of room they have felt surreal after various Bay Area apartments. He told me they have so much counter space, they can keep appliances like the food processor in the kitchen itself.</p><p>  湾区各种公寓之后，他们觉得房间数量超现实。他告诉我说，他们的柜台空间很大，可以将诸如食物处理器之类的电器放在厨房里。</p><p>    And then the people around them — neighbors — started doing something strange. They brought cinnamon rolls and handwritten welcome notes.</p><p>    然后周围的人-邻居-开始做些奇怪的事情。他们带来了肉桂卷和手写的欢迎词。</p><p>    “We’re selling our house and moving out of SF. Where should we go and why?” Justin Kan, a serial entrepreneur who co-founded Twitch, asked on Twitter in August.</p><p>    “我们正在出售房屋，然后搬离旧金山。我们应该去哪里，为什么？”共同创立Twitch的连续企业家贾斯汀·坎（Justin Kan）于八月在Twitter上提问。</p><p>  Joe Lonsdale, a co-founder of software company Palantir, which moved from Silicon Valley to Denver, wrote back: “Come to Austin with us. Growing tech ecosystem and Texas is the best place to make a stand together for a free society.”</p><p>  从硅谷搬到丹佛的软件公司Palantir的联合创始人乔·朗斯代尔（Joe Lonsdale）回信：“和我们一起去奥斯丁。不断发展的技术生态系统和德克萨斯州是为自由社会站在一起的最佳场所。”</p><p>    Austin, population 1 million and the Texas city most would say is closest in spirit to the Bay Area, has long had a healthy tech industry. Computer giant Dell is based nearby. The University of Texas is one of the top public colleges in the country. And the music scene is eclectic and creative.</p><p>    奥斯汀（Austin）人口100万人，得克萨斯州城市在精神上最接近湾区，长期以来一直拥有健康的科技产业。计算机巨头戴尔就在附近。德克萨斯大学是美国顶尖的公立大学之一。音乐界是折衷和创造性的。</p><p>  Now the local tech industry is rapidly expanding. Apple is opening a $1 billion, 133-acre campus. Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have all either expanded their footprints in Austin or have plans to. Elon Musk, the Tesla founder and one of the two richest men in the world, said he had moved to Texas. Startup investor money is arriving, too: The investors at 8VC and Breyer Capital opened Austin offices last year.</p><p>  现在，本地技术行业正在迅速发展。苹果将​​斥资10亿美元兴建一个133英亩的园区。 Alphabet，亚马逊和Facebook都已经扩大了在奥斯丁的足迹，或者有计划。特斯拉创始人，世界上两个最富有的人之一埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）表示，他已搬到德克萨斯州。创业投资者的钱也到了：8VC和Breyer Capital的投资者去年在奥斯汀开设了办事处。 </p><p>  Some of the favorite gurus of tech workers are already there, like Tim Ferriss, life-hacker, who left for Austin in 2017, and Ryan Holiday, whose writing about stoicism is influential among the startup set.</p><p>一些最受科技工作者欢迎的专家已经出现了，例如生活黑客蒂姆·费里斯（Tim Ferriss）于2017年离开奥斯汀，以及瑞安·哈里德（Ryan Holiday），其有关坚决主义的著作在创业公司中颇具影响力。</p><p>  Sahin Boydas, the founder of a remote-work startup who had lived in San Francisco and its suburbs over the last decade, saw all of that. He looked at his wife and two young children, working and learning from home while crammed into a Cupertino rental that had seen better days. Much of the late summer, the air was full of smoke from wildfires. For days, electricity would go in and out at his house.</p><p>  过去十年来一直住在旧金山及其郊区的远程工作创业公司的创始人Sahin Boydas看到了所有这一切。他看着妻子和两个年幼的孩子，在家工作和学习，却挤进了库比蒂诺（Cupertino）的一间租房，那里的日子过得更好。夏末的大部分时间，空气中充满了野火的烟雾。几天来，电力会在他家进出。</p><p>  “You start to feel stupid,” said Boydas, who is 37. “I can understand the 1% rich people, the very top investors and entrepreneurs, they can be happy there.”</p><p>  37岁的博伊达斯（Boydas）说：“您开始感到愚蠢。我能理解1％的富人，最顶尖的投资者和企业家，他们在那里会很高兴。”</p><p>  So he and his family moved to Austin. For the same price as their three-bedroom apartment in Cupertino, they have a five-bedroom home on an acre of land. For the first time, Boydas has outdoor space. He just acquired two rabbits for his children. Sure, it’s (very) hot, but he’s ready for it.</p><p>  于是他和家人搬到了奥斯丁。以与他们在库比蒂诺（Cupertino）的三居室公寓相同的价格，他们在占地一英亩的土地上拥有一间五居室房屋。 Boydas首次拥有室外空间。他刚刚为孩子们养了两只兔子。当然，（非常）热，但他已经准备好了。</p><p>  “We’re going to get a cat and a dog,” he said. “We could never do that before.”</p><p>  他说：“我们要养猫和狗。” “我们永远做不到。”</p><p>  And it’s not just the cost of rent that is lower — the water bill is lower; the trash bill is lower; the cost of a family dinner at a restaurant has fallen significantly. Boydas said he hadn’t even known about the taxes.</p><p>  不仅租金成本降低了，水费也降低了。垃圾费用较低；在餐厅享用家庭晚餐的费用已大大降低。博伊达斯（Boydas）说，他甚至都不知道这些税。</p><p>  “I run payroll for myself, and when I saw zero, I called the accountant like there’s an error — there’s no tax line here,” he said. “And they were like, ‘Yeah there’s no tax.’”</p><p>  他说：“我为自己开工资单，当我看到零时，我打电话给会计师，就像发生了一个错误-这里没有税线。” “他们就像，‘是的，没有税。’” </p><p>    “Ok guys hear me out, what if we move Silicon Valley to Miami,” tweeted Delian Asparouhov, a principal at Founders Fund, which invests in startups.</p><p>Founders Fund的负责人Delian Asparouhov在推特上发推文说：“好听的人告诉我，如果我们将硅谷搬到迈阿密该怎么办？”</p><p>    Now there is a very vocal Miami faction, led by a few venture capital influencers, trying to tweet the city’s startup world into existence.</p><p>    现在，在一些风险投资影响者的带领下，迈阿密出现了一个声音非常强烈的派系，试图推特这座城市的初创世界已经存在。</p><p>  The San Francisco exodus means the talent and money of newly remote tech workers are up for grabs. And it’s not just the mayor of Miami trying to lure them in.</p><p>  旧金山的外流意味着新的远程技术工作者的才智和金钱可以争夺。不仅是迈阿密市长试图吸引他们。</p><p>  Topeka, Kansas, started Choose Topeka, which will reimburse new workers $10,000 for the first year of rent or $15,000 if they buy a home. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will pay you $10,000 to move there. The nation of Estonia has a new residency program just for digital nomads.</p><p>  堪萨斯州的托皮卡（Topeka）启动了选择托皮卡（Selecte Topeka）服务，新员工第一年的房租将获得10,000美元的补偿，而购房者则可获得15,000美元的补偿。俄克拉荷马州塔尔萨市将支付您10,000美元搬到那里。爱沙尼亚国家针对数字游牧民族推出了一项新的居住计划。</p><p>  A program in Savannah, Georgia, will reimburse remote workers $2,000 for the move there, and the city has created various social activities to introduce the newcomers to one another and to locals.</p><p>  佐治亚州萨凡纳市的一项计划将为偏远地区的工人返还2000美元，该市开展了各种社交活动，将新移民介绍给彼此和向当地人介绍。</p><p>  “We try to make the transition easy,” said Jennifer Bonnett, vice president of Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship at the Savannah Economic Development Authority, whose program started in June.</p><p>  “我们试图使过渡变得容易，”创新与创新副总裁詹妮弗·邦内特（Jennifer Bonnett）说。萨凡纳经济发展局的企业家精神，该计划于6月开始。</p><p>  Keyan Karimi, 29 and a startup investor, took Savannah’s invitation to move there (though he didn’t ask for the reimbursement).</p><p>  29岁的凯恩·卡里米（Keyan Karimi）是一家创业投资人，他应萨凡纳（Savannah）的邀请搬到那里（尽管他没有要求偿还）。 </p><p>  Seeing the inequality of billionaires in San Francisco’s wealthy Pacific Heights neighborhood and the homeless camps down the hill ground on him. So Karimi went home to his parents house in Atlanta to ride out some of the pandemic. Then he detected something strange. The city he thought was boring had gotten pretty interesting. Or maybe he had just never noticed before.</p><p>看到旧金山富裕的太平洋高地（Pacific Heights）附近的亿万富翁不平等，以及在他山下的无家可归者营地。因此，卡里米（Karimi）回到他在亚特兰大（Atlanta）的父母住所，以度过一些大流行。然后他发现了一些奇怪的东西。他认为无聊的城市变得非常有趣。也许他以前从未注意到过。</p><p>    “I had no idea how much was going on here. I was sort of myopic,” he said, pausing and correcting himself: “No, I was arrogant.”</p><p>    “我不知道这里发生了什么。我有点近视，”他停下来并纠正自己：“不，我很自大。</p><p>  Karimi started looking at Zillow and studying the Southern cities he had ignored. He likes old houses and wants to fix one up. Savannah has a lot of those. So just a few months after leaving his $4,000-a-month one-bedroom in San Francisco, he’s working with the local business development group to put together a maritime innovation center in Savannah to invest in and guide shipping and logistics startups. He bought one of those old houses.</p><p>  Karimi开始看着Zillow并研究他忽略的南部城市。他喜欢旧房子，并希望将其修复。萨凡纳（Savannah）有很多。因此，在离开他每月4,000美元的旧金山一居室仅仅几个月后，他就与当地的业务发展小组合作，在萨凡纳建立了一个海上创新中心，以投资并指导航运和物流初创公司。他买了其中一栋旧房子。</p><p>  Savannah has one of the largest ports in the country. “No one knows that,” Karimi said. “I figure we can do something with that.”</p><p>  萨凡纳拥有该国最大的港口之一。卡里米说：“没人知道。” “我认为我们可以做到这一点。”</p><p>    There are 33,000 members in the Facebook group Leaving California and 51,000 in its sister group, Life After California. People post pictures of moving trucks and links to Zillow listings in new cities.</p><p>    Facebook团体“离开加利福尼亚”中有33,000名会员，其姐妹团体“ After After California”中有51,000名会员。人们张贴移动卡车的图片，并链接到新城市的Zillow列表。</p><p>    The founder of both groups, Terry Gilliam, is planning to take members on a house-hunting road trip through eastern Tennessee this spring with stops in popular post-San Francisco destinations. One tour will be Chattanooga, Knoxville and Johnson City.</p><p>    两组的创始人Terry Gilliam都计划今年春天带领成员在田纳西州东部进行房屋寻路之旅，并在旧金山后受欢迎的目的地停靠。一个游览将是查塔努加，诺克斯维尔和约翰逊城。</p><p>  “When people decide to leave San Francisco, they usually don’t know where they want to go, they just want to go,” Gilliam said.</p><p>  吉利姆说：“当人们决定离开旧金山时，他们通常不知道要去哪里，他们只是想去。” </p><p>  Gilliam, who met his wife when they worked at a Bay Area Chili’s restaurant, said she wouldn’t let the family move yet. And so the Pied Piper of the California-bashing Facebook community is still in Fremont, on the eastern end of Silicon Valley.</p><p>吉利姆（Gilliam）在妻子在湾区辣椒餐厅工作时遇到了他的妻子，她说她不会让家人搬家。因此，扑灭加利福尼亚的Facebook社区的“吹笛人”仍然在硅谷东端的弗里蒙特。</p><p>    “People always get pissed at me when they hear birds in my Zoom,” said Ed Zaydelman, a longtime leader in San Francisco’s Burning Man community (and former New York City club promoter), who is forming an entrepreneur community in Costa Rica. “And I say, ‘Come join.’ ”</p><p>    旧金山“燃烧人”社区（和前纽约市俱乐部发起人）的长期领导人埃德·扎德尔曼（Ed Zaydelman）说：“人们在听到我的Zoom时听到鸟叫总是很生气。”他正在哥斯达黎加形成一个企业家社区。 “而且我说，‘快加入吧。’”</p><p>  If San Francisco of the 2010s proved anything, it’s the power of proximity. Entrepreneurs could find a dozen startup pitch competitions every week within walking distance. If they left a big tech company, there were startups eager to hire, and if a startup failed, there was always another.</p><p>  如果2010年代的旧金山证明了一切，那就是接近的力量。企业家每周可以在步行距离之内找到十二打创业比赛。如果他们离开一家大型科技公司，就会有急于招聘的初创公司，而如果一家初创公司倒闭，那么总会有另外一家。</p><p>  They could live jammed into a rambling Victorian with fellow nerds who — thanks to the popularity of polyamory — were having a lot of sex. More money was made faster in the Bay Area by fewer people than at any other time in American history.</p><p>  他们可能生活在与书呆子同行的维多利亚时代，由于书呆子的盛行，他们之间发生了很多性行为。与美国历史上任何其他时间相比，更少的人在湾区更快地赚了更多的钱。</p><p>  No one leaving the city is arguing that a culture of innovation is going to spring up over Zoom. So some are trying to recreate it. They are getting into property development, building luxury tiny-home compounds and taking over big, funky houses in old resort towns.</p><p>  没有人离开这座城市争辩说，一种创新文化将在Zoom上兴起。因此，有些人正在尝试重新创建它。他们正在从事房地产开发，建造豪华的微型房屋，并接管旧度假小镇中的大而时髦的房屋。</p><p>  “All these people want to do is this live-on-the-land stuff, but it’s not as easy as people think,” Zaydelman said.</p><p>  扎德尔曼说：“所有这些人都想做的是这种地面上的东西，但这并不像人们想象的那么容易。”</p><p>  He calls his new development company Nookleo, and he is building five tiny-home communities for remote workers. The little houses cost between $30,000 and $40,000. Each compound has four to six homes, a small organic farm, a yoga deck, a swimming pool and a kitchen clubhouse. Two clusters are already underway in Costa Rica, with Mexico and Portugal next.</p><p>  他给自己的新开发公司Nookleo打电话，他正在为远程工人建立五个小型家庭社区。这些小房子的价格在30,000美元到40,000美元之间。每个院落都有四至六个房屋，一个小型有机农场，一个瑜伽甲板，一个游泳池和一个厨房会所。哥斯达黎加已经有两个集群，接下来是墨西哥和葡萄牙。 </p><p>  In Puerto Rico, Gillian Morris, founder of travel app Hitlist, is also recruiting. Her San Francisco breaking point came after her roommate was attacked on their street, and she did a sort of gut check of herself over whether the street scenes and feeling of danger were worth the high rent. She moved to San Juan in 2019, even though it also has a crime problem. But now she lives in a huge house in the middle of the city.</p><p>在波多黎各，旅行应用程序Hitlist的创始人Gillian Morris也正在招聘。她的室友在他们的街道上遭到袭击之后，她的旧金山出现了转折点，她对自己的直觉进行了检查，以检查街景和危险感是否值得高昂的租金。她于2019年搬到圣胡安，尽管它也有犯罪问题。但是现在她住在市中心的一栋大房子里。</p><p>  “I have 12 people leaving San Francisco over the next three months to join a co-living community I set up,” she said. “It’s amazing here.”</p><p>  她说：“在接下来的三个月中，我将有12个人离开旧金山，加入我所建立的共同生活社区。” “这真是太神奇了。”</p><p>  And for the Baja-leaning, there is Bear Kittay, a co-founder of Good Money, an online banking platform. Now Kittay, another longtime fixture of the Burning Man festival turned developer, is building a property for the new digital nomads.</p><p>  对于Baja-lean来说，还有在线银行平台Good Money的联合创始人Bear Kittay。现在，Kitting是Burning Man音乐节的另一个长期定位，变成了开发商，正在为新的数字游牧民建造房产。</p><p>  “The things that make this city ill are not within my control to change,” he said of San Francisco. “A lot of people are choosing to go to places where there’s opportunity, and maybe it’s a place that is more conservative and there can be an integration of dialogue. Or a place where they can live closer to nature. That’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>  他谈到旧金山时说：“让这座城市生病的事情不在我控制范围之内。” “很多人都选择去有机会的地方，也许这是一个比较保守的地方，可能会整合对话。或者是他们可以更接近自然的地方。这就是我们正在做的。”</p><p>  Nikil Viswanathan, who co-founded blockchain startup Alchemy, recently fled San Francisco. He said that there was no reason anymore for him or his colleagues to be there, and that he had always wanted to live on the beach. So now he does, in San Diego.</p><p>  共同创立区块链创业公司Alchemy的Nikil Viswanathan最近逃离了旧金山。他说，他或他的同事再也没有理由要在那里了，他一直想住在海滩上。所以现在他在圣地亚哥。</p><p>  But the expats still find one another. Not long ago, he stumbled on a cluster at a party.</p><p>  但是这些移民仍然可以找到对方。不久前，他偶然发现了一个聚会上的一群人。</p><p>  “I knew it was an SF crew because when I walked in because they had the full dual monitor with the ergonomic keyboard on a standing desk,” Viswanathan said, adding that conversation revolved around the lower cost of living. “One of the SF guys was like: ‘I just had a burrito for $6. It was amazing.’”</p><p>  Viswanathan说：“我知道这是一名SF乘员，因为当我走进去时，因为他们的全双显示器和站立时都配有符合人体工学的键盘，” Viswanathan补充说。 “一个SF小伙子就像：‘我只有6美元的墨西哥卷饼。这是惊人的。'” </p><p>        Longtime Bay Area residents may well say good riddance to people like Viswanathan. People who distrusted the young newcomers from the start will say this change is a good thing. Hasn’t this steep growth in wealth and population in a tiny geography always seemed unsustainable?</p><p>长期居住在湾区的居民可能会对像维斯瓦纳森这样的人说好骑手。从一开始就不信任年轻新人的人们会说，这种改变是一件好事。在狭小的地理区域内，如此迅速的财富和人口增长似乎总是不可持续的吗？</p><p>  These tech workers came like a whirlwind. Virtually every community from San Jose in the south to Marin County in the north has fought the rise of new housing for the arrivals of the last decade. Maybe spreading the tech talent around America is smart.</p><p>  这些科技工作者像旋风一样来了。从南部的圣何塞到北部的马林县，几乎每个社区都为过去十年来新住房的兴起而奋斗。也许在美国各地传播技术人才是明智的。</p><p>  Locals have also seen this play before. Moving trucks come to take a generation of tech ambition away, and a few years later moving trucks return with new dreamers and new ambitions.</p><p>  当地人以前也看过这出戏。移动卡车带走了一代人的技术抱负，几年后，移动卡车又有了新的梦想家和新的抱负。</p><p>  After the dot-com bust in 2001, there were fallow years before the latest, long-lasting boom — just as there were fallow years after the PC industry consolidated a decade earlier. That led to the dot-com boom. It is the circle of life in the Bay Area.</p><p>  在2001年互联网泡沫破灭之后，距离最近的持久繁荣还很短的假期-就像十年前PC行业整合之后的休假年一样。这导致了互联网繁荣。这是海湾地区的生活圈。</p><p>  And those who are staying are digging in. “When 12 friends left, it felt like powerlessness,” said Diana Helmuth, a 32-year-old writer and marketer in Oakland. “Like these forces were too big.
