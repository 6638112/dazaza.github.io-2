The momen  t it happened was not the triumphant Hollywood ending some surely envisioned; it just felt like I had just survived something and was fortunate to come out the other end. For so long, I thought I might be haunted for the rest of my days by knowing where the treasure was but being unable to find it. Would I still be out there in that section of forest 50 years from now looking for it? When I finally found it, the primary emotion was not joy but rather the most profound feeling of relief in my entire life.</p><p>我就是那个发现阿甘著名宝藏的人。发生这件事的那一刻并不是一些人肯定预想的好莱坞的胜利结局；只是感觉我刚刚度过了一些难关，很幸运地走出了另一端。在很长一段时间里，我想我可能会因为知道宝藏在哪里但找不到它而在我的余生中萦绕不去。50年后，我还会在那片森林里寻找它吗？当我最终找到它时，最主要的情绪不是喜悦，而是我一生中最深刻的解脱。</p><p> I figured out the location where he wished to die (and thus, where his treasure was) back in 2018, but it took me many months to figure out the exact spot. This treasure hunt was the most frustrating experience of my life. There were a few times when I, exhausted, covered in scratches and bites and sweat and pine pitch, and nearing the end of my day’s water supply, sat down on a downed tree and just cried alone in the woods in sheer frustration.</p><p>早在2018年，我就想出了他想要死的地方(因此，他的宝藏在哪里)，但我花了好几个月的时间才弄清楚确切的地点。这次寻宝是我一生中最令人沮丧的经历。有几次，我筋疲力尽，满身划痕、咬伤、汗水和松树沥青，一天的供水即将结束，我坐在一棵倒下的树上，独自一人在树林里沮丧地哭泣。</p><p> I spent about 25 full days of failure looking for the treasure at that location before getting it.</p><p>在找到宝藏之前，我花了整整25天的时间在那里寻找宝藏，但都以失败告终。</p><p> When I got back to my rental car after the find, I put my hands on the steering wheel and bawled my eyes out. Then I remembered Forrest said the person who found the chest would either laugh out loud or start crying.</p><p>被发现后，当我回到租来的车里时，我把手放在方向盘上，哭出了我的眼睛。然后我想起了福雷斯特说过的，发现箱子的人要么放声大笑，要么放声大哭。</p><p> I realized he had been right and started to get annoyed that I still couldn’t stop his quotes from popping into my head even after the chase was finally done.</p><p>我意识到他是对的，甚至在追逐最终结束后，我仍然无法阻止他的语录出现在我的脑海里，这让我开始感到恼火。</p><p> I laughed at myself for getting annoyed. Then I realized I had just fulfilled his other premonition about laughing out loud.</p><p>我嘲笑自己被惹恼了。然后我意识到我刚刚实现了他关于放声大笑的另一种预感。</p><p>  In the weeks after, I still couldn’t stop myself from reflexively thinking about what he was thinking. After living inside his head for two years, meeting him in person was sensory overload. I could now analyze his words and facial expressions and tone in real time, mere feet away from me. I could ask him questions about the chase and he would actually answer them! I never got used to it, and I was still analyzing him unnecessarily when he died, unable to turn my obsession off.</p><p>在那之后的几周里，我仍然无法阻止自己条件反射地思考他在想什么。在他的头脑里生活了两年后，与他面对面的感觉超负荷了。我现在可以实时分析他的话、面部表情和语气，离我只有几步之遥。我可以问他关于追逐的问题，他真的会回答的！我从来没有习惯过，当他去世的时候，我仍然在不必要地分析他，无法关闭我的痴迷。</p><p> Now that he’s gone, I’m no longer annoyed those Fenn quotes are still rattling around my brain. His words will live with me and every searcher out there for the rest of our lives.</p><p>现在他走了，我不再对那些仍在我脑海中萦绕的芬恩名言感到恼火。他的话将在我和每一位搜索者的余生中留下深刻的印象。</p><p> I spent a couple more days crying after Forrest passed. He had meant so much to me in such a short time, and I had so much more I had wanted to ask him, the kind of things that were just better done face to face. For weeks he had wanted to fly me back to Santa Fe to spend more time with him (he even tried to convince me to move there), but circumstances out of our control made it more practical for me to come later.</p><p>在福雷斯特去世后，我又哭了几天。在这么短的时间里，他对我来说意义重大，我也有太多想问他的事情，那些面对面更好做的事情。几个星期以来，他一直想让我飞回圣达菲，以便有更多的时间和他在一起(他甚至试图说服我搬到那里去)，但我们无法控制的情况让我以后去那里更现实。</p><p> I had never met Forrest until this June, and it was destined to be our only time spent together in person.</p><p>直到今年6月，我才与福雷斯特相遇，这注定是我们唯一一次私下相处的时间。</p><p> But I’m thankful for the time we did have. When I met Forrest, I told him I hadn’t been sure I would ever get to meet him. The treasure was just too hard to find. He told me with a big smile that he had always said it was difficult to find but not impossible, and I had proved him right.</p><p>但我很感激我们度过的时光。当我遇到福雷斯特时，我告诉他，我不确定我还能不能见到他。宝藏实在太难找到了。他笑着告诉我，他一直说很难找到，但也不是不可能，我已经证明了他是对的。</p><p>  Forrest Fenn was born in 1930 in Temple, Texas. A poor student who disappointed his educator father, he grew into a life of adventure — a decorated Air Force pilot who was shot down in the Vietnam War and survived the Laos jungle, a rakish and prominent art dealer who courted the rich and famous, and, in his third and final act, a compulsive memoirist who wrote a poem that launched a treasure hunt in the Rocky Mountains that inspired many thousands of regular folks the world over.</p><p>福雷斯特·芬恩1930年出生于得克萨斯州坦普尔。他是一名贫穷的学生，令他的教育工作者父亲失望，他成长为冒险的生活--一名在越南战争中被击落并在老挝丛林中幸存下来的获奖空军飞行员，一名追求富人和名人的淫荡而著名的艺术品交易商，在他的第三幕也是最后一幕中，他是一位强迫症回忆录作家，他写了一首诗，开启了一场落基山脉寻宝运动，激励了世界各地成千上万的普通人。</p><p> The first line of  his New York Times obituary calls him “eccentric.” “I’ve been called ‘eccentric’ and I’m flattered by that,” Forrest once said, “because the difference between an eccentric and a kook is an eccentric has money.”</p><p>他在“纽约时报”讣告的第一行称他为“怪人”。“我被称为‘怪人’，这让我受宠若惊，”福雷斯特曾经说过，“因为怪人和怪人的区别就是怪人有钱。”</p><p> Forrest Fenn was the kind of man to drink buttermilk out of the bottle. He kept alligators in the garden of his art gallery. He collected run-over soda cans as pieces of found art. He loved books and language and held onto words like “crean” that apparently nobody but he still used. He went into business with former Texas Governor John Connally, the Johnson and Nixon confidante who was wounded by the “Magic Bullet” in the Kennedy assassination, to sell Elmyr de Hory’s famed fraudulent masterpieces  as fraudulent masterpieces. Forrest once shot a mountain lion and leapt down into a canyon, grabbed hold of the top of a tree, climbed down it, and tied the carcass to a rope so he could lift it out and get a $50 bounty from the Cattleman’s Association.</p><p>阿甘·芬是那种从瓶子里喝酪乳的人。他在美术馆的花园里养了几条鳄鱼。他收集用过的苏打汽水罐作为发现的艺术品。他热爱书籍和语言，并坚持使用像“Crean”这样的词，显然除了他之外，没有人在使用这些词。他与前德克萨斯州州长约翰·康纳利(John Connally)做生意，将埃尔米尔·德·霍里(Elmyr De Hory)著名的欺诈杰作作为欺诈杰作出售。康纳利是约翰逊和尼克松的红颜知己，在肯尼迪遇刺事件中被神奇的子弹打伤。有一次，福雷斯特射杀了一头美洲狮，跳下峡谷，抓住一棵树的顶端，爬了下来，把身体绑在绳子上，这样他就可以把它抬出来，并从牧人协会那里获得50美元的赏金。</p><p> He was also a man with an independent mind and a security with his masculinity (perhaps uncommon to those of his generation) that allowed him to express difficult feelings and question his own decisions and values in life, becoming a pacifist after retiring from the military and even regretting that affair with the beautiful mountain lion that had run in his direction.</p><p>他也是一个拥有独立思想和安全感的人，他的男子气概(可能在他那一代人中很少见)让他能够表达艰难的情绪，质疑自己的人生决定和价值观，退伍后成为一名和平主义者，甚至后悔与向他奔来的美丽美洲狮的恋情。</p><p>  Forrest wrote poignantly about his struggles with self-esteem and self-worth, and it’s probably these writings I connected to most.</p><p>福雷斯特辛酸地写下了他与自尊和自我价值的斗争，也许我最能与这些作品联系在一起。</p><p> In the few years before I had heard of Forrest Fenn, my confidence in myself had been totally destroyed. I like to think it aided me in finding the treasure — without any self-confidence in my abilities, I had to stick to the evidence and not stray into hunches and speculation not strictly supported by the facts, and into their close cousin, confirmation bias.</p><p>在我听说福雷斯特·芬恩之前的几年里，我对自己的信心完全被摧毁了。我愿意认为，这帮助我找到了宝藏--我对自己的能力没有任何自信，我不得不坚持证据，不能迷失在没有严格事实支持的直觉和猜测中，也不能迷失在他们的近亲--确认偏见中。</p><p> Knowing the exact spot on the globe where a person would like to die is a weird intimacy to share with a stranger, but the experience of figuring it out and proving it beyond a reasonable doubt provided confidence that was intoxicating to me, and perhaps helping me regain that belief in myself will be Forrest’s greatest legacy to me. In the outpouring of love Forrest received from his fans after his death, it was clear he knew just what to say to make people feel special. For me, it was soon after I told him I found the treasure, when he let me know, completely unprompted, that he thought I was a genius.</p><p>知道一个人想死的确切地点是与陌生人分享的一种奇怪的亲密关系，但弄清楚并排除合理怀疑的经历给了我令人陶醉的信心，也许帮助我重新获得对自己的信念将是福雷斯特留给我的最大遗产。在阿甘死后粉丝们倾注的爱意中，很明显他知道该说些什么才能让人觉得自己很特别。对我来说，就在我告诉他我找到了宝藏后不久，他完全不假思索地让我知道，他认为我是个天才。</p><p> Few human beings peak as octogenarians. For most, old age is a slow dimming of the light, but Forrest fought against that. At 80, he attracted a large audience for the first time in his writing career, and in the next decade, as he continually dealt with the passing of his peers, he made hundreds or perhaps thousands of new friends, treasure searchers he met at gatherings and sometimes in his comfortable museum of a home.</p><p>很少有人能达到八十多岁的顶峰。对大多数人来说，年老是光线慢慢变暗，但福雷斯特反对这一点。80岁的他在写作生涯中第一次吸引了大量观众，在接下来的十年里，随着他不断应对同龄人的逝去，他结识了数百甚至数千名新朋友，他们是他在聚会上认识的寻宝者，有时也是在他舒适的家博物馆里结识的。</p><p> For a decade, he wrote memoir at a breakneck pace, sharing the stories of his life with great relish yet seeming to never run out of them, even when he was down to telling us about the condiments in his refrigerator and the spices in his cabinets. He didn’t seem to mind that much of his audience wasn’t really listening to what he was saying and were only looking for secret hints.</p><p>十年来，他以惊人的速度写着回忆录，津津有味地分享着自己生活中的故事，但似乎从未用完过，即使他只想告诉我们他冰箱里的调味品和橱柜里的香料。他似乎并不介意他的许多听众没有认真听他说的话，只是在寻找秘密的暗示。</p><p> For a man who expressed anxiety about getting Alzheimer’s, he seemed to have found the perfect deterrent to cognitive decline — talking frequently and in guarded detail about a huge, closely-held secret to a cache of gold, yet never divulging it to the thousands of interested people inquiring. In a decade, he never made more than a couple of subtle slip-ups in front of all the dogged reporters who came to his house, and even those apparently haven’t been caught by anyone besides me. He never paid to advertise his hunt, yet seemingly every media outlet wanted a piece of him, and he still managed to stay sharp as a tack and “keep his secret where” till the very end.</p><p>对于一个对患上阿尔茨海默氏症表示焦虑的人来说，他似乎已经找到了阻止认知衰退的完美方法--频繁地、谨慎地谈论一个隐藏在黄金宝藏中的秘密，但从不向成千上万感兴趣的人透露。十年来，他从来没有在所有来到他家的顽固记者面前犯过几个细微的失误，即使是那些显然除了我之外没有人发现的记者。他从来没有花钱为他的狩猎做广告，但似乎每个媒体都想从他身上分一杯羹，他仍然保持着敏锐的头脑，并将自己的秘密“保守在哪里”，直到最后。</p><p> Forrest had the ultimate poker face. In the summer of 2018, the only time I had talked to Forrest on the phone before finding the treasure, I called to tell him in desperation I had found a “blaze” — the mark that the poem says points to the treasure — that seemed after some effort by me to have been faked by a cruel fellow searcher even though it had evidently been there for years. I couldn’t believe the chances. I told him exactly where I had been searching, but the call only lasted about 20 seconds, and he gave no impression he found my discovery at all interesting.</p><p>福雷斯特有一张终极的扑克脸。2018年夏天，在找到宝藏之前，我唯一一次与福雷斯特通电话，我绝望地打电话告诉他，我发现了一场“火焰”-诗中说的那个指向宝藏的标记-经过我的努力，似乎是被一个残忍的同行搜索者伪造的，尽管它显然已经在那里存在了多年。我简直不敢相信有这么大的机会。我准确地告诉了他我一直在搜索的地方，但通话只持续了大约20秒，他没有给人留下任何印象，他对我的发现一点也不感兴趣。</p><p> That fake blaze was less than 1,000 feet from where I eventually found the treasure. And that’s not even the half of that story.</p><p>那场假大火距离我最终找到宝藏的地方不到1000英尺。这甚至还不是故事的一半。</p><p> When I met Forrest, he had forgotten about the phone call and found it amusing when I told him. Of course, he had no idea how much I had tortured myself trying to read his reaction to that call.</p><p>当我遇到福雷斯特时，他已经忘记了那个电话，当我告诉他的时候，他觉得很有趣。当然，他不知道为了了解他对那通电话的反应，我对自己进行了多大的折磨。</p><p>  Lost in some of the remembrances of Forrest is his generosity. Forrest used his chase not for personal profit, but supported a local independent bookseller and raised tens of thousands of dollars for cancer victims. He was a benefactor and donated artifacts from his personal collection over the years to the Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming, on whose board he served for several years. Despite his years of disagreements with academics over the subject of archaeology, he supported and served on the board of the George C. Frison Institute at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Wyoming. Dr. Frison  passed away the very same day as Forrest.</p><p>在对福雷斯特的一些回忆中，迷失了他的慷慨。福雷斯特利用他的追逐不是为了个人利益，而是支持当地的一家独立书商，并为癌症患者筹集了数万美元。他是一位捐赠者，将多年来个人收藏的文物捐赠给了怀俄明州科迪的西部水牛城比尔中心(Buffalo Bill Center Of The West)，他曾在该中心的董事会工作了几年。尽管多年来他与学者在考古学问题上存在分歧，但他支持并担任怀俄明大学人类学系乔治·C·弗里森研究所(George C.Frison Institute)的董事会成员。弗里森博士和福雷斯特在同一天去世了。</p><p> Of course, Forrest’s greatest gift to humanity was his treasure. Sure, it could only be given to one person, the one who found it, but it inspired hope the world over and the joy of discovery for all those who got to go out and appreciate the wonders of the Rockies. No good deed goes unpunished, of course, and that hope spun off into myriad permutations Forrest couldn’t have anticipated.</p><p>当然，福雷斯特给人类最大的礼物就是他的宝藏。当然，它只能给一个人，就是找到它的那个人，但它激发了全世界的希望，让所有走出去欣赏落基山脉奇观的人都感到了发现的喜悦。当然，没有一件好事不会受到惩罚，而这种希望演变成了福雷斯特无法预料到的无数组合。</p><p> In some, that hope turned into false certainty in some people’s minds, and they had to be rescued or tragically perished after finding themselves in dangerous circumstances out in the wilderness. In others, that hope turned into entitlement, that the hard work they put into this all-or-nothing hunt meant they were owed the treasure in some way, and that entitlement turned into bitterness and loud recitations of his personal imperfections that some declared to the world in the wake of his death. In others still, the hope turned into obsession that tricked their own minds into strange and harmful ideas. At my most raw points of gnawing frustration, even I resented Forrest.</p><p>在一些人心中，这种希望变成了错误的确定性，他们在荒野中发现自己处于危险的境地后，不得不获救或悲惨地死去。在另一些人，这种希望变成了权利，他们在这场要么全有要么一无所有的追捕中付出的辛勤工作意味着，他们在某种程度上得到了宝藏，而这种权利变成了苦涩，并大声背诵了他的个人缺陷，一些人在他去世后向世界宣布了这一点。还有一些人，希望变成了痴迷，欺骗了自己的头脑，产生了奇怪而有害的想法。在我最痛心的挫败感中，甚至连我都对阿甘怀恨在心。</p><p> Forrest had a tremendous penchant, though, for turning the other cheek. He did an incredible thing and dealt with tremendous doubt directed his way, but he kept to his word, and it was a gratifying experience to prove him right.</p><p>不过，福雷斯特有一种极大的嗜好，那就是对另一张脸置之不理。他做了一件令人难以置信的事情，并处理了巨大的疑虑，为他指明了方向，但他信守诺言，证明他是正确的，这是一次令人欣慰的经历。</p><p> In a final act of selflessness, in what should have been his moment of redemption, he went to great lengths to protect my anonymity. Over the past decade, he and his family have suffered stalkers, break-ins, and a potential kidnapping (just to name the things that have been publicized) from misguided searchers. I told him I didn’t want to be looking over my shoulder for people like that for the rest of my life, and he was completely understanding. Forrest went out of his way to protect me, a person he had never met before, even though in some ways it undermined the legitimacy of this hunt in some people’s minds.</p><p>在最后一次无私的行动中，在本应是他救赎的时刻，他不遗余力地保护我的匿名性。在过去的十年里，他和他的家人遭受了被误导的搜索者的跟踪、闯入和潜在的绑架(只是列举了已经被公布的事情)。我告诉他，在我的余生里，我不想再回头看这样的人，他完全理解。福雷斯特特意保护我，一个他以前从未见过的人，尽管这在某种程度上破坏了这次狩猎在某些人心目中的合法性。</p><p> My family and I will be eternally grateful. It’s incredibly generous to leave a chest full of gold out in the wilderness for someone to find. It’s a whole other thing to set aside one’s driving desire for a legacy in order to protect that stranger. Selflessness is the only way to describe it.</p><p>我和我的家人会永远感激你。在荒野中留下满满一箱金子，让人去寻找，真是令人难以置信的慷慨。为了保护陌生人而抛开对遗产的强烈渴望是完全另一回事。无私是描述它的唯一方式。</p><p>  When I visited Forrest’s house in June, he asked me if I had ever read his book on his friendship with the artist Eric Sloane,  Seventeen Dollars a Square Inch. I hadn’t. He gave me a copy. It’s a classic Forrest Fenn production: lavish, large, very personal, a little eccentric, and totally indifferent to appealing to the book-buying public’s wallets. But of course it looks gorgeous on my coffee table.</p><p>今年6月，当我拜访福雷斯特的家时，他问我是否读过他写的关于他与艺术家埃里克·斯隆(Eric Sloane)友谊的书《每平方英寸17美元》(17美元/平方英寸)。我没有。他给了我一份复印件。这是一部经典的福雷斯特·芬恩的作品：奢华、大方、非常个人化、有点古怪，对吸引购书大众的钱包完全无动于衷。当然，它放在我的咖啡桌上看起来很漂亮。</p><p>  In the craziness of the past few months, I neglected to read it, but I picked it up after Forrest passed, and I’m glad I did. It’s a loving tribute of one friend to another, and reading it has helped me with my own loss. Its dust cover says:</p><p>在过去几个月的疯狂中，我忽略了读这本书，但在福雷斯特去世后，我拿起了它，我很高兴我读了。这是一位朋友对另一位朋友充满爱意的致敬，读了它帮助我弥补了自己的损失。它的尘封上写着：</p><p> Eric was a gifted painter and writer, and Forrest was a grateful admirer who sold his work. Their friendship lasted only ten years, but they were very influential years. You will see.</p><p>埃里克是一位才华横溢的画家和作家，福雷斯特是一位感恩的崇拜者，他卖出了自己的作品。他们的友谊只维持了十年，但却是很有影响力的几年。你会看到的。</p><p> According to page 92, Forrest and Eric are busy now working to finish the book they began together years ago, so he won’t notice if I steal and rework that passage:</p><p>根据第92页的描述，福雷斯特和埃里克现在正忙着完成他们几年前开始合作的那本书，所以他不会注意到我是否偷走了那段文字并重新修改：</p><p> Forrest was a gifted adventurer and writer, and the finder was a grateful admirer who sold his famous treasure. Their friendship lasted only three months, but they were very influential months. You will see.</p><p>福雷斯特是一位才华横溢的冒险家和作家，而发现者是一位满怀感激的崇拜者，他卖掉了自己著名的宝藏。他们的友谊只维持了三个月，但却是非常有影响力的几个月。你会看到的。</p><p> Alas, I’m a millennial and have student loans to pay off, so it wouldn’t be prudent to continue to own the Fenn Treasure. And at the end of the day, for all our similarities, Forrest and I couldn’t be less alike when it comes to collecting. I’m the kind of person who feels burdened by possessions and most free adventuring the world out of a carry-on suitcase, so the treasure and I will have to soon part, and I will offer it for sale (minus the turquoise row bracelet returned to Forrest, of course).</p><p>唉，我已经是千禧一代了，还有助学贷款要还，所以继续拥有芬币宝藏是不明智的。归根结底，尽管我们有许多相似之处，但在收藏方面，福雷斯特和我的相似之处丝毫没有减少。我是那种被财产压得喘不过气来的人，也是那种最自由地从随身行李箱里去世界探险的人，所以我和宝藏很快就要分开了，我会把它拿出来出售(当然，除了归还给福雷斯特的那只绿松石手镯)。</p><p> The treasure is a unique piece of American cultural history. The gold glitters, but brighter still are the embedded hopes and dreams of all the many thousands who searched for it. It should belong to a person or institution who will fully appreciate owning such an incredible thing.</p><p>这件宝藏是美国文化史上独一无二的一部分。金子闪闪发光，但更闪亮的是成千上万寻找它的人的希望和梦想。它应该属于一个人或机构，他会非常感激拥有这样一件不可思议的东西。</p><p> But Forrest had a final wish for where he thought the treasure should end up. The first step for me will be to try to make that happen.</p><p>但是，对于他认为宝藏应该在哪里结束，福雷斯特有一个最后的愿望。对我来说，第一步就是努力实现这一目标。</p><p> As for the legacy of Forrest’s chase, I suppose it is in many ways in my hands, as wrong as that feels. To be honest, I’m not sure what to do.</p><p>至于阿甘追逐的遗产，我想在很多方面都掌握在我手中，尽管我觉得这是错误的。老实说，我不知道该怎么办。</p><p> Whatever. Making plans is antagonistic to freedom.  You will see. I’ll be back to answer some questions, in any case.</p><p>管他呢。制定计划是与自由对立的。你会看到的。不管怎样，我会回来回答几个问题。</p><p>  Forrest ends  Seventeen Dollars a Square Inch with a quadplet poem for Eric (republished in  Scrapbook 177). “Quadplet,” of course, is one of those invented words Forrest indulged in, so who knows what it really means, but I tried writing one for my own friend:</p><p>《阿甘正传》以一首写给埃里克的四联体诗(在剪贴簿177中转载)结束了每平方英寸17美元。当然，“四胞胎”是福雷斯特沉迷于创造的词之一，所以谁知道它的真正含义，但我试着给我自己的朋友写了一个：</p><p> Cold, refreshing waters babble of your life, Whistling pines proffer your wisdoms to sup; In your place, the mountains rumble your name; Can I even try to shut them up?</p><p>清凉的水在你的生命中潺潺流淌，呼啸的松树为你提供智慧，代替你的地方，群山隆隆地呼唤着你的名字，我还能试着让它们闭嘴吗？</p><p> I’m sure I will go alone in there again in the future and appreciate its beauty anew. Forrest didn’t make it back to his special place in his final hour. But when I go back some day to lie down beneath those towering pines, tilt my hat over my face to shield against the bright sun, and drift off into one more afternoon nap in that serene forest in the wilds of the Cowboy State, I know he will be resting there next to me.</p><p>我相信以后我还会一个人去那里，重新领略它的美。在他生命的最后一小时，福雷斯特没有回到他特殊的地方。但有一天，当我回到那里，躺在高耸的松树下，把帽子戴在脸上遮挡明媚的阳光，在牛仔州野野那片宁静的森林里再睡一个午觉时，我知道他会躺在我旁边。</p><p> I hope that place will always remain as pristine as when he first discovered it.</p><p>我希望那个地方永远保持他第一次发现它时的原汁原味。</p><p>   Many searchers know that  Seventeen Dollars a Square Inch doesn’t end with just the quadplet. There were two more characters at the bottom of the page — ΩΩ. Two omegas, side by side, just like at the end of  The Thrill of the Chase. I’d always thought they could possibly have been a hint to a clue in the poem, but how could they be if they were also in this earlier book about Eric Sloane? To me, there wasn’t enough evidence of intent in order to consider it a hint.</p><p>许多搜索者知道，每平方英寸17美元并不只是四胞胎的结果。页面底部还有两个字符-ΩΩ。两个欧米加，并排在一起，就像在《追逐》激动人心的结尾一样。我一直认为它们可能是这首诗中的线索，但如果它们也出现在这本关于埃里克·斯隆(Eric Sloane)的早期书籍中，他们怎么可能是线索呢？对我来说，没有足够的意图证据来认为这是一个暗示。</p><p> It’s something I wanted to ask Forrest about when we met again, but I never got to. Some things will always remain a mystery, and I think that’s fitting. Forrest always said he was ambivalent about whether he wanted to see the chest found in his lifetime or for the chase to last many decades after he passed, and the depth of that ambivalence profoundly revealed itself to me in the process of figuring out exactly where it was.</p><p>当我们再次见面时，我想问福雷斯这件事，但我一直没能问到。有些事情永远是个谜，我认为这是合适的。福雷斯特总是说，他很矛盾，他是想在有生之年看到这只箱子被发现，还是想在他去世后的几十年里继续追逐，在弄清楚它到底在哪里的过程中，这种矛盾的深度深刻地向我展示了出来。</p><p> He was completely open with me about anything I wanted to confirm or know when we met, but his emotions were a little perplexing.
