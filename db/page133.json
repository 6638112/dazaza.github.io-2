The company designs new methodologies to enhance the capacity of its partners to respond effectively to the challenges of harms such as violent extremism, disinformation, gender-based violence, and organised crime.\n It has delivered threat monitoring and analysis, digital campaigns, tailored interventions, and a range of other services in over 57 countries and thirty three languages, for governments, tech companies, and international organisations. Moonshot&#39;s clients include the Department of Homeland Security, USAID, the U.S. Department of State, the UK Home Office, social media platforms and search engines, such as Facebook and Google.\n &#34;I&#39;m really pleased that Moonshot will be establishing its new Software Development Centre in Dublin, which will create 37 new jobs over the next three years. The data analytics firm operates in over 57 countries, which is a testament to the company&#39;s success to date,&#34; Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Leo Varadkar said.\n  &#34;When I left Ireland during the great recession the thought of bringing so many jobs home would have sounded too good to be true. But this move for our company isn&#39;t based on emotion, when we looked at talent and market access Ireland was the obvious choice.\n &#34;We&#39;ve spent the last five years growing our capabilities, team and client base, in response to both a continual increase in demand, but also the continued evolution of the threats posed by extremists, conspiracy theorists and organised crime.&#34;\n  &#34;We&#39;re expanding our footprint and growing our team to meet some of the world&#39;s toughest challenges head on. Establishing ourselves in Dublin is a key part of that process and our Software Development Centre will allow us to access the talent and skills we need to realise our vision. There has never been a more important moment for us to scale our mission, and our Dublin team will get us there.&#34;\n  &#34;Ireland offers a safe and stable investment location with access to the EU market, an educated and skilled workforce and an attractive environment where people want to live and work. Moonshot&#39;s decision to set up here is very welcome and is a further endorsement of Ireland&#39;s position as a tech hub in Europe and its continued attractiveness for investments from high growth companies.&#34;\n Earlier this month Moonshot announced that it has raised US $7million (UK \u00a35 million) in Series A funding from Beringea, the transatlantic venture capital firm, and UK-based Mercia.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 11:45:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1,establish", "title": "Moonshot\u5728\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u9996\u90fd\u5efa\u7acb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5fc3 ", "title_en": "Moonshot to establish software development centre in Irish capital", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/269958729/moonshot-to-establish-software-development-centre-in-irish-capital", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1", "establish"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066972, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79d1\u5e7b\u5c0f\u8bf4/\u559c\u5267/\u5b8c\u5168\u4e25\u8083\u7684\u8c08\u8bdd\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e86JavaScript\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e00\u822c\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece1995\u5e74\u52302035\u5e74\u3002\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u4eb2\u6216\u53cdJavaScript; \u5766\u7387\u5730\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\uff06\uff0339; S\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u4e1a\u754c\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u5f71\u54cd\u975e\u5e38\u79ef\u6781\u3002 \u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a0\u91cc\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff08\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u672a\u6765\u6d3e\uff09\u601d\u60f3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e9b\u6467\u6bc1\u6240\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u622a\u56fe\u3002  \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u60a8\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u559c\u6b22\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3JavaScript\uff0cSQL\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7b49\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u3002 \u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7531\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u793a\u4f8b\u5728\u60a8\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u3002 ", "note_en": "This science fiction / comedy / completely serious talk traces the history of JavaScript, and programming in general, from 1995 until 2035.

make a Covid vaccine, an effort that led to at least five highly effective shots in record time. Now it\u2019s pouring more than $3 billion on a neglected area of research: developing pills to fight the virus early in the course of infection, potentially saving many lives in the years to come.\n The new program,  announced on Thursday by the Department of Health and Human Services, will speed up the clinical trials of a few promising drug candidates. If all goes well, some of those first pills could be ready by the end of the year. The Antiviral Program for Pandemics will also support research on entirely new drugs \u2014 not just for the coronavirus, but for viruses that could cause future pandemics.\n A number of other viruses, including influenza, H.I.V. and hepatitis C, can be treated with a simple pill. But despite more than a year of research, no such pill exists to treat someone with a coronavirus infection before it wreaks havoc. Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration\u2019s program for accelerating Covid-19 research,  invested far more money in the development of vaccines than of treatments, a gap that the new program will try to fill.\n Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key backer of the program, said he looked forward to a time when Covid-19 patients could pick up antiviral pills from a pharmacy as soon as they tested positive for the coronavirus or develop Covid-19 symptoms.\n \u201cI wake up in the morning, I don\u2019t feel very well, my sense of smell and taste go away, I get a sore throat,\u201d Dr. Fauci said in an interview. \u201cI call up my doctor and I say, \u2018I have Covid and I need a prescription.\u2019\u201d\n Dr. Fauci\u2019s support for research on antiviral pills stems from his own experience fighting AIDS three decades ago. In the 1990s, his institute conducted research that led to some of the first antiviral pills for H.I.V., \u201cprotease inhibitors\u201d that block an essential virus protein and can keep the virus at bay for a lifetime.\n In the early 2000s, researchers found that an antiviral called sofosbuvir could cure hepatitis C close to 100 percent of the time. Tamiflu, a pill for influenza, can  cut the time it takes to recover from an infection, and reduce the chances that a bout of the flu will land someone in the hospital.\n At the start of the pandemic, researchers began testing existing antivirals in people hospitalized with severe Covid-19. But many of those trials failed to show any benefit from the antivirals. In hindsight, the choice to work in hospitals was a mistake. Scientists now know that the best time to try to block the coronavirus is in the first few days of the disease, when the virus is replicating rapidly and the immune system has not yet mounted a defense.\n Many people crush their infection and recuperate, but in others, the immune system misfires and starts damaging tissues instead of viruses. It\u2019s this self-inflicted damage that sends many people with Covid-19 to the hospital, as the coronavirus replication is tapering off. So a drug that blocks replication early in an infection might very well fail in a trial on patients who have progressed to later stages of the disease.\n  So far, only one antiviral has demonstrated a clear benefit to people in hospitals: remdesivir. Originally investigated as a potential cure for Ebola, the drug seems to shorten the course of Covid-19 when given intravenously to patients. In October, it became the first \u2014 and so far, the only \u2014 antiviral drug to gain  full F.D.A. approval to treat the disease.\n Yet remdesivir\u2019s performance has left many researchers  underwhelmed. In November, the World Health Organization  recommended against using the drug.\n Remdesivir might work more effectively if people could take it earlier in the course of Covid-19 as a pill. But in its approved formulation, the compound doesn\u2019t work orally. It can\u2019t survive the passage from the mouth to the stomach to the circulatory system.\n Researchers from around the world are testing other antivirals already known to work in pill form. One such compound, called molnupiravir, was developed in 2019 by researchers at Emory University and has been tested against viruses including influenza and  Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.\n In partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics of Miami, the Emory team carried out experiments in mice that were so impressive that Merck approached them to bring the drug into human clinical trials for Covid-19.\n \u201cWe thought this molecule was really amazing,\u201d said Daria Hazuda, vice president of infectious disease and vaccine research at Merck.\n In a trial of hospitalized patients, however, molnupiravir seemed to have no effect on the disease. In April, the companies  announced they were scrapping the trial.\n \u201cI see that, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, no duh,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tim Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that those kinds of medications would not make a dramatic improvement in someone\u2019s outcome when they\u2019ve been sick for several days.\u201d\n The companies began a  second study last fall, this time testing the drug on people recently diagnosed with Covid-19. That trial is continuing, and Merck is recruiting volunteers with a higher risk of infection, such as older people with obesity and diabetes. Dr. Hazuda said the trial should deliver clear results by October.\n Last year, the government\u2019s funding of Covid-19 treatments focused on a handful of candidates, such as monoclonal antibodies and remdesivir. Many other studies on antivirals were  small and underfunded. In January, the incoming Biden administration began designing a new program dedicated to antiviral pills.\n  Last week saw the first results of this planning. The Department of Health and Human Services  announced that it would purchase from Merck 1.7 million doses of molnupiravir at a cost of $1.2 billion, provided that the current trial leads to authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. The government may seek similar deals for two other antivirals far along in clinical trials, according to Dr. David Kessler, the chief science officer of the Biden administration\u2019s Covid-19 response team.\n The hope \u201cis that we can get an antiviral by the end of the fall that can help us close out this chapter of the epidemic,\u201d Dr. Kessler said in an interview.\n One of the drugs the government is considering is  AT-527, developed by Atea Pharmaceuticals. The compound has already proven safe and effective as a treatment for hepatitis C, and early studies suggested it might also work against Covid-19. Roche has partnered with Atea to test it in people, and the companies are currently running a late-stage clinical trial.\n The other drug on the government\u2019s radar was created by scientists at Pfizer, adapted from a molecule initially designed in the early 2000s as a potential drug for SARS. That drug had sat on the shelf for years, but last spring, the scientists decided to modify its structure so that it would work against the new coronavirus\u2019s protease. More than 200 Pfizer researchers joined forces on the effort on the molecule, known for now as PF-07321332.\n The drug had been designed to be taken intravenously, but the Pfizer researchers succeeded in altering its structure to work as a pill. When  mice were given the drug orally, it reached high enough levels in the body to block the coronavirus. Pfizer  launched a clinical trial in March to study its safety in people, and expects to move to later-stage testing next month.\n Dr. Kessler acknowledged that there will be challenges in using such pills to drive down hospitalizations and deaths from Covid-19. People will need to gain access to the drugs as soon as they test positive. \u201cYour testing programs are going to have to be linked to your treatment,\u201d he said.\n And if the history of antiviral research is any guide, the first drugs for Covid-19 will probably only offer modest benefit against the disease, Dr. Fauci said. But that would be a good start.\n \u201cWith all of these drugs that we\u2019ve dealt with over the years, we\u2019ve never hit a home run the first time at bat,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cA line drive off the left-field wall to start would be really good.\u201d\n The government will also spend up to $1.2 billion on research centers where scientists will carry out early-stage studies on drugs that block the coronavirus in other ways. Some drugs may interfere with other essential viral proteins, while others may make it impossible to copy the virus\u2019s genes.\n Even if the next generation of pills doesn\u2019t arrive for a few years, many scientists say that the research will be a good investment. \u201cIt could help with this pandemic and potentially provide a first line of defense for the next one,\u201d said Mark Namchuk, the director of therapeutic translation at Harvard Medical School.\n The program will support not only research on pills that work against coronaviruses, but also against other high-risk pathogens, such as flaviviruses, which cause diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile fever, and togaviruses, which cause mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya and eastern equine encephalitis.\n \u201cThere will always be a threat,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a long-range need for drugs.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 11:02:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6cbb\u7597,treat,\u7814\u7a76", "title": "\u6cbb\u7597covid-19\u7684\u4e38\uff1f \u7f8e\u56fd\u535a\u89c8\u4f1a ", "title_en": "A Pill to Treat Covid-19?

about how I found a vulnerability on Apple forgot password endpoint that allowed me to takeover an iCloud account. The vulnerability is completely patched by Apple security team and it no longer works.  Apple Security Team rewarded me $18,000 USD as a part of their bounty program but I refused to receive it. Please read the article to know why I refused the bounty.\n After my  Instagram account takeover vulnerability, I realized that many other services are vulnerable to race hazard based brute forcing. So I kept reporting the same with the affected service providers like  Microsoft, Apple and a few others.\n Many people mistook this vulnerability as typical brute force attack but it isn\u2019t. Here we are sending multiple concurrent requests to the server to exploit the  race condition vulnerability present in the rate limits making it possible to bypass it.\n  The  forgot password option of Apple ID allows us to change our password using 6 digit OTP sent to our mobile number and email address respectively. Once we enter the correct OTP we will be able to change the password.\n  For security reasons, apple will prompt us to enter the trusted phone number along with email address to request OTP.\n So to exploit this vulnerability, we need to know the trusted phone number as well as their email address to request OTP and will have to try all the possibilities of the 6 digit code, that would be around 1 million attempts (10 ^ 6).\n As for as my testing, the forgot password endpoint had pretty strong rate limits. If we enter more than 5 attempts, our account will be locked for the next few hours, even rotating the IP didn\u2019t help.\n   Then I tried for race hazard based brute forcing by sending simultaneous POST requests to apple server and found a few more limitations.\n To my surprise, apple have rate limits for concurrent POST requests from single IP address, not just to the forget password endpoint but to the entire apple server. We cannot send more than 6 concurrent POST requests, it will be dropped. It will not just be dropped but our IP address will be blacklisted for future POST requests with 503 error.\n    So I thought they aren\u2019t vulnerable to this type of attack \ud83d\ude14 but still had some hope since these are generic rate limits across the server and not specific to the code validation endpoint.\n  iforgot.apple.com resolves to 6 IP addresses across the globe \u2013 (17.141.5.112, 17.32.194.36, 17.151.240.33, 17.151.240.1, 17.32.194.5, 17.111.105.243).\n There were two rate limits we have seen above, one is triggered when we send more than 5 requests to forgot password endpoint (http://iforgot.apple.com/password/verify/smscode) and another one is across the apple server when we send more than 6 concurrent POST requests.\n Both these rate limits are specific to apple server IP which means we can still send requests (with in limits though) to another apple server IP.\n We can send upto 6 concurrent requests to an apple server IP (by binding iforgot.apple.com to the IP) from single client IP address as per their limits. There are 6 apple IP address resolved as mentioned above. So we can send upto 36 requests across the 6 apple IP address (6 x 6 = 36) from single IP address.\n Therefore, the attacker would require 28K IP addresses to send up to 1 million requests to successfully verify the 6 digit code.\n 28k IP addresses looks easy if you use cloud service providers, but here comes the hardest part, apple server has a strange behavior when we try to send POST requests from cloud service providers like AWS, Google cloud, etc.\n  They reject the POST request with 502 Bad gateway without even checking the request URI or body. I tried changing IPs but all of them returned same response code, which means they have blacklisted the entire ASN of some cloud service providers if am not wrong \ud83d\ude44\n  It makes the attack harder for those who rely on reputed cloud services like AWS. I kept trying various providers and finally found a few service providers their network IPs are not blacklisted.\n Then I tried to send multiple concurrent POST requests from different IP address to verify the bypass.\n  And it worked!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 Now I can change the password of any Apple ID with just their trusted phone number \ud83d\ude07\n Of course the attack isn\u2019t easy to do, we need to have a proper setup to successfully exploit this vulnerability. First we need to bypass the SMS 6 digit code then 6 digit code received in the email address. Both bypasses are based on same method and environment so we need not change anything while trying the second bypass. Even if the user has two factor authentication enabled, we will still be able to access their account, because 2FA endpoint also shares the rate limit and was vulnerable. The same vulnerability was also present in the password validation endpoint.\n I reported this information with detailed reproduction steps and a video demonstrating the bypass to Apple security team on July 1st, 2020. Apple security team acknowledged and triaged the issue with in few minutes of report.\n  I didn\u2019t get any updates from Apple after triage so I kept following up for status updates and they said they are working on a fix on Sep 9th, 2020.\n  Again, no updates for next 5 months and then this email came when I asked for status\n  They said they are planning to address the issue in upcoming security update. I was wondering what is taking so long for them to react to a critical vulnerability.\n I kept retesting the vulnerability to know whether its fixed instead of relying on them. I tested on April 1st, 2021 and realized a patch for the vulnerability was released to production but still there were no updates from Apple. I asked them whether the issue is patched and the response is same as they have no status updates to share.\n  I was patient and waiting for them to update the status. After a month, I wrote them that the issue was patched on April 1st itself and why am not being updated about it, I also told that I wanted to publish the report to my blog.\n Apple security team asked me whether it is possible to share the draft of the article with them before publishing. That is when things started to go unexpected.\n After sharing the draft, they denied my claim saying that this vulnerability do not allow to takeover majority of the icloud accounts. Here\u2019s their response\n  As you can see in the email screenshot, their analysis revealed that it only works against iCloud accounts that has not been used in passcode / password protected Apple devices.\n  I argued that even if the device passcode (4 digit or 6 digit) is asked instead of 6 digit code sent to email, it will still share the same rate limits and would be vulnerable to race condition based brute forcing attacks. We will also be able to discover the passcode of the associated Apple device.\n    The above screenshot shows how the page looks now but it wasn\u2019t the same before my report.\n    \u201cIn some cases\u201d is prefixed to the paragraph on October 2020, that is exactly after I was told that they are working on a fix in September 2020.\n It looks like everything was planned, the page was updated to support their claim of only limited users were vulnerable. That page wasn\u2019t updated for years but getting a minor update after my report. It doesn\u2019t look like a coincidence.\n When I asked about it, they said the updates are made due to changes in iOS 14. What does resetting password using trusted email / phone number has to do with iOS 14 I asked. If that is true, are trusted phone number and email used to reset the password before iOS 14? If that\u2019s the case, my report is applicable to all Apple accounts. I didn\u2019t get any answer from them.\n I was disappointed and told them that I am going to publish the blog post with all the details without waiting for their approval. Here\u2019s the reply I got from them.\n  They arranged a call with Apple team engineers to explain what they found in their analysis and also to answer any questions I may have.\n During the call, I asked why it is different from the vulnerability I found.  They said that the passcode is not being sent to any server endpoint and is verified in the device itself. I argued that there is no way for a random apple device to know another device\u2019s passcode without contacting Apple server. They said it is true that the data is sent to server but it is verified using a cryptographic operation and they cannot reveal more than that due to security concerns.\n I asked what if we find out the encryption process through reverse engineering to replicate it and brute force the Apple server with concurrent requests. I didn\u2019t get any definite answer for that question. They concluded that the only way to brute force the passcode is through brute forcing the Apple device which is not possible due to the local system rate limits.\n I couldn\u2019t accept what Apple engineers said, logically, it should be possible to replicate what Apple device is doing while sending the passcode data to server.\n I thought to verify it myself to prove them. If what they said is true, passcode validation endpoint should be vulnerable to race condition based brute forcing. After a few hours of testing I found that they have SSL pinning specific to the passcode validation endpoint, so the traffic sent to the server cannot be read by MITM proxy like burp / charles.\n Thanks to  checkra1n and  SSL Kill Switch, using their tool I was able to bypass pinning and read the traffic sent to server.\n I figured out that Apple uses  SRP (Secure Remote Password), a  PAKE protocol to verify the user knows the right passcode without actually sending it to the server. So what the engineers said is right, they aren\u2019t sending the passcode directly to server. Instead, both server and client do some mathematical calculations using the previously known data to derive at a key (more like diffie-hellman key exchange).\n Without getting into the specifics of SRP, let me get straight to what is necessary in our context.\n Apple server has two stored values namely verifier and salt specific to each user created at the time of setting or updating the passcode.\n Whenever a user initiates a SRP authentication with username and a ephemeral value A, Apple server responds back with the salt of the specific user and a ephemeral value B.\n  SRP is known to prevent bruteforce attacks as it has user-specific salt and a verifier, so even if someone steals our database, they will still need to perform a CPU intensive bruteforce for each user to discover the password one by one. That gives enough time for the affected vendor to react to it.\n But, in our case, we don\u2019t have to bruteforce a large number of accounts. Bruteforcing single user is enough to get into their iCloud account as well as finding their passcode.\n Brute forcing is possible only when you have both salt and verifier specific to the target user. After bypassing the SMS passcode we can easily impersonate as the target user and obtain the salt. But the problem here is verifier. We should either somehow obtain the verifier from server or bypass the rate limit on key verifying endpoint.\n If the rate limit is bypassed, we can keep on trying different combinations of key obtained using the precomputed values of the passcode until we arrive at the matching key. Obviously, it requires a lot of computation to derive a key of each 4 or 6 digit numeric passcodes (from 0000/000000 to 9999/999999).\n  When we enter the passcode in an iPhone / iPad during password reset, the device initiates SRP authentication by sending the user session token obtained from the successful SMS verification. The server responds back with the salt of the respective user. The passcode and the salt are hashed to then derive the final key which is sent to https://p50-escrowproxy.icloud.com/escrowproxy/api/recover to check whether it matches the key computed (using ephemeral, salt and verifier) on the server.\n   String tag has all the data mentioned above but are sent in DATA BLOB format. The first thing I wanted to check is rate limit before decoding the values of BLOB. I sent the request 30 times concurrently to check whether the endpoint was vulnerable.\n  To my shock, it wasn\u2019t vulnerable. Out of 30 requests, 29 of them were rejected with internal server error.\n Rate limiting would be performed in the Apple server itself or in HSM (hardware security module). Either way, the rate limit logic should be programmed as such to prevent race hazard. There is very bleak chance for this endpoint to be not vulnerable to race hazard before my report because all the other endpoints I tested was vulnerable \u2013 SMS code validation, email code validation, two factor authentication, password validation was all vulnerable.\n If they did patch it after my report, the vulnerability became a lot more severe than what I initially thought. Through bruteforcing the passcode, we will be able to identify the correct passcode by differentiating the responses. So we not only can takeover any iCloud account but also discover the passcode of the Apple device associated with it. Even though the attack is complex, this vulnerability could hack any iPhone / iPad that has 4 digit / 6 digit numeric passcode if my assumption is right.\n Since it is now validating the concurrent requests properly, there is no way for me to verify my claim, the only way I can confirm this is by writing to Apple but they aren\u2019t giving any response in this regard.\n   The actual bounty mentioned for iCloud account takeover in Apple\u2019s website is $100,000 USD. Extracting sensitive data from locked Apple device is $250,000 USD. My report covered both the scenarios (assuming the passcode endpoint was patched after my report), so the actual bounty should be $350,0000. Even if they chose to award the maximum impact out of the two cases, it should still be $250,000 USD.\n Selling these kind of vulnerabilities to government agencies or private bounty programs like  zerodium could have made a lot more money. But I chose the ethical way and I didn\u2019t expect anything more than the outlined bounty amounts by Apple.\n  But $18,000 USD is not even close to the actual bounty. Lets say all my assumptions are wrong and Apple passcode verifying endpoint wasn\u2019t vulnerable before my report. Even then the given bounty is not fair looking at the impact of the vulnerability as given below.\n Bypassed the two factor authentication. It is literally like 2FA doesn\u2019t exist due to the bypass. People who are all relying on 2FA are vulnerable. This itself is a major vulnerability.\n Bypassed the password validation rate limits. All the Apple ID accounts that use common / weak / hacked passwords are vulnerable even if they have two factor authentication enabled. Once hacked, the attacker can track the location of the device as well as wipe the device remotely. 2014 celebrities iCloud hack is majorly because of weak passwords.\n Bypassed the SMS verification. If we know the passcode or password of the device associated with the iCloud account. Lets say any of your friends or relatives knows your device passcode, using this vulnerability, they can takeover your iCloud account and also can erase your entire device remotely over the internet without having physical access to it.\n We can  takeover all Apple IDs that are not associated with a passcode protected Apple device due to both SMS and email verification code bypass, which means Any apple device without passcode or password, like anyone who turned off or didn\u2019t set the passcode / password.\n Any Apple ID created without apple device, like in browsers or in an android app and not been used in password protected apple devices\n For example, 50 Million+ android users have downloaded Apple music app. In those, majority of them may not have used Apple devices. They are still Apple users and their information like credit cards, billing address, subscription details, etc could be exposed.\n They need not reward the upper cap of the iCloud account takeover ($100k) but it should at least be close to it considering the impact it has created.\n After all my hard work and almost a year of waiting, I didn\u2019t get what I deserved because of Apple\u2019s unfair judgement. So I refused to receive the bounty and told them it is unfair. I asked them to reconsider the bounty decision or let me publish the report with all the information. There wasn\u2019t any response to my emails. So I have decided to publish my article without waiting for their response indefinitely.\n Therefore, I shared my research with Apple for FREE of cost instead of an unfair price.\n I request Apple security team to be more transparent and fair at least in the future. I would like to thank Apple for patching the vulnerability.\n I repeat, the vulnerability is completely fixed and the scenarios described above no longer works. Thank you for reading the article!

The measurement technology could also open up opportunities for remote sensing of the Earth.    Left hands and right hands are almost perfect mirror images of each other. But whatever way they are twisted and turned, they cannot be superimposed onto each other. This is why the left glove simply won&#39;t fit the   as well as it fits the left. In science, this property is referred to as chirality.\n  Just like hands are chiral, molecules can be chiral, too. In fact, most molecules in the cells of living organisms, such as DNA, are chiral. Unlike hands, however, that usually come in pairs of left and right, the molecules of life almost exclusively occur in either their &#34;left-handed&#34; or their &#34;right-handed&#34; version. They are homochiral, as researchers say. Why that is, is still not clear. But this molecular homochirality is a characteristic property of life, a so-called biosignature.\n  As part of the MERMOZ project (see info box), an international team led by the University of Bern and the National Center of Competence in Research NCCR PlanetS, has now succeeded in detecting this signature from a distance of 2 kilometers and at a velocity of 70 kph. Jonas K\u00fchn, MERMOZ project manager of the University of Bern and co-author of the study that has just been published in the journal  Astronomy and Astrophysics, says: &#34;The significant advance is that these measurements have been performed in a platform that was moving, vibrating and that we still detected these biosignatures in a matter of seconds.&#34;\n    &#34;When light is reflected by biological matter, a part of the light&#39;s electromagnetic waves will travel in either clockwise or counterclockwise spirals. This phenomenon is called circular polarization and is caused by the biological matter&#39;s homochirality. Similar spirals of light are not produced by abiotic non-living nature,&#34; says the first author of the study Lucas Patty, who is a MERMOZ postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bern and member of the NCCR PlanetS,\n   Measuring this circular polarization, however, is challenging. The signal is quite faint and typically makes up less than one percent of the light that is reflected. To measure it, the team developed a dedicated device called a spectropolarimeter. It consists of a camera equipped with special lenses and receivers capable of separating the circular polarization from the rest of the light.\n    Yet even with this elaborate device, the new results would have been impossible until recently. &#34;Just 4 years ago, we could detect the signal only from a very close distance, around 20 cm, and needed to\n  observe the same spot for several minutes to do so,&#34; as Lucas Patty recalls. But the upgrades to the instrument he and his colleagues made, allow a much faster and stable detection, and the strength of the signature in circular polarization persists even with distance. This rendered the instrument fit for the first ever aerial circular polarization measurements.\n    Using this upgraded instrument, dubbed FlyPol, they demonstrated that within mere seconds of measurements they could differentiate between grass fields, forests and urban areas from a fast moving helicopter. The measurements readily show living matter exhibiting the characteristic polarization signals, while roads, for example, do not show any significant circular polarization signals. With the current setup, they are even capable of detecting signals coming from algae in lakes.\n  After their successful tests, the scientists now look to go even further. &#34;The next step we hope to take, is to perform similar detections from the International Space Station (ISS), looking down at the Earth. That will allow us to assess the detectability of planetary-scale biosignatures. This step will be decisive to enable the search for life in and beyond our Solar System using polarization,&#34; says MERMOZ principal investigator and co-author Brice-Olivier Demory, professor of astrophysics at the University of Bern and member of the NCCR PlanetS says.\n  The sensitive observation of these circular   signals is not only important for future life detection missions. Lucas Patty explains: &#34;Because the signal directly relates to the molecular composition of life and thus its functioning, it can also offer valuable complementary information in Earth remote sensing.&#34; It can for instance provide information about deforestation or plant disease. It might even be possible to implement   in the monitoring of toxic algal blooms, of coral reefs and the effects of acidification thereon.        More information:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC. H. L.
