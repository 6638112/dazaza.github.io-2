"note_en": "We\u2019ve all heard this riddle: if you dig down deep enough in Windows 10, you\u2019ll find elements that date from Windows 3.x days. But is it actually true? In this article we\u2019ll discover just how many UI layers are in Windows and when they were first introduced.\n For the purpose of this experiment, I chose the latest Windows 10 Insider Build (as of February 6th, 2021), which is Windows 10 build 21301.\n   First, we begin with the latest and greatest, Fluent Design. Announced in 2017 and introduced with Windows 10 1803 update, Fluent Design is a major redesign of the Modern Design Language 2 (MDL2), aimed at bringing elements like Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. It also introduces the Reveal effects and the Acrylic translucent background.\n As of now, most of the inbox (UWP) applications have been upgraded to take use of Fluent elements, as well as some of the more front-facing elements, like the Start Menu, Activity Center and the Login Screen.\n Although Fluent Design was well appreciated, most of the enthusiasts considered this move too little, too late, as only a small subset of features have been enhanced with this new design style.\n   Just as we dig a bit deeper into the OS, we can see elements that haven\u2019t been upgraded since Windows 8/8.1.\n Some of these are glaring omissions, like the volume flyout, the USB flyout as well as some elements from the login screen.\n  Other Metro elements, although not as prominent, are the boot screen (which will soon be replaced with a newer one) and WinRE\n   Did you know: the first time the spinning dots were introduced was in Windows 8 build 7989.\n  Just like Windows 10, Windows 8 was also plagued with inconsistency issues (for better or for worse). However, Windows 8 added meaningful enhancements to major user elements, like the Windows Explorer or Task Manager. Although they would receive some quality-of-life improvements in subsequent Windows 10 updates, changes would be minimal.\n Also, an important change brought by Windows 8 was the redesign of the File Transfer dialogs.\n  Some of these changes started in Windows 7, which brings us to the fourth layer:\n  Windows 7 is without doubt one of the most beloved versions of Windows of all time, praised for its great enhancements over Windows Vista. It brought many new features that, although weren\u2019t as significant as those that Vista introduces, made Windows 7 a very solid OS, and a true successor to Windows XP. However, one of the most infamous changes brought with Windows 7 is the Ribbon UI, which is a feature ported from Office 2007. Some of the apps that got updated with the new Ribbon UI are Paint and Wordpad.\n Although at some point Microsoft decided to deprecate the classic Paint in favor of the new Paint 3D (introduced with Windows 10 Creators Update), after major backlash, they reversed their decision.\n  Other features that were updated in Windows 7 and remained the same ever since are: Windows Media Player 12, Remote Desktop Connection and some file dialogs.\n   Windows Vista was a monumental Windows release, one that brought much needed modernization to the platform. Almost all of the fundamentals of the OS have been in some way or another improved, from the bootloader to the driver model. However, as we all know by now, Windows Vista would come to be one of the worst Windows releases ever, plagued with issues from the beginning. One of the few features that were praised, though, was the UI. It redesigned some of the fundamentals that haven\u2019t been updated since Windows 95. One of the main promotors of this change was the introduction of the so-called Aero Wizards, replaced the previous wizard standard, Wizard97.\n  Other features that were redesigned in Windows Vista and are basically the same in Windows 10: the Control Panel, the Search program, Windows Fax and Scan.\n  Speaking of Windows Vista: did you know that in certain special circumstances Windows 10 falls back to the Vista boot screen? It happens when your video card doesn\u2019t support the video mode that the standard boot screen uses.\n  Believe it or not, there are not that many XP elements embedded into Windows 10. That\u2019s probably because most of the fundamentals were updated already into Windows 2000. However, Windows 10 contains some file dialogs from XP, which are seen when one is installing a driver.\n   Windows 2000 was a big milestone for the NT lineup of operating systems from Microsoft. It also was the stepping stone that would signal the start the transition to a new, unified Windows vision. However, Windows 2000 was still a business-oriented OS, which means that it brought a lot of new features designed for experts.\n One of the most significant addition is the Management Console (MMC), whose UI elements are basically the same ever since.\n  Another feature introduced by default in Windows 2000 is Windows Installer, which still has the same icon from when it was first introduced!\n  Another UI element that hasn\u2019t changed (apart from branding, of course) is winver, whose design was introduced in Windows 2000 build 1946.\n  While Windows 2000 introduced lots of features aimed for power users, Windows 95 is probably the most significant Windows release to date. It introduced fundamental paradigms that still hold to this day. It introduced features like the Start Menu, context menus, the taskbar and recycle bin. While these features were of course updated over the course of many years, some remained almost exactly the same.\n  An element that is basically a relic of the older computing habits, where one had to protect their precious CRT screen is the screensaver settings.\n    One more common UI element that passed the test of time is the folder properties screen.\n  And there are so many more UI elements that haven\u2019t been touched since Windows 95. Is this a case of timeless design? I\u2019ll let you judge for yourself.\n  Well, this is not really a \u201cUI layer\u201d, as I haven\u2019t been able to find any interface elements predating Windows 95 (although I have a feeling that there certainly are). However, there is a peculiar file in Windows 10, called moricons.dll, which contains a lot of old icons from the DOS days. Take a look:\n  Well, that\u2019s pretty much it. As you may know, Microsoft is planning on overhauling the UI of Windows with their \u201cSun Valley\u201d update, which aims to unify the design of the OS. However, as we can see, Windows is one behemoth of an operating system. Will their efforts to finally make a cohesive user experience succeed?

", "note_en": "When dabbling with the laws of motion in the 17th century, Isaac Newton first realized that it\u2019s indeed possible to send an object out of Earth, into space. As long as an object is shot away from Earth with a high enough velocity, it  will reach space and orbit our planet.\n With the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 onboard a powerful rocket, the Soviet Union achieved exactly that. For the first time in four billion years of life on Earth, something was intentionally sent to space.\n  Give a satellite another speed boost, by either launching it on a more powerful rocket or using thrusters onboard, and it can escape from Earth\u2019s gravitational hold completely. That\u2019s how you can send missions to  Venus,  Mars,  Saturn and beyond. But one of these two things is not like the other.\n  The rocket equation is what allows scientists and engineers to quantify and compare the energy required to reach various destinations in space. Its implications are far-reaching but not intuitive so I shall attempt to explain them without use of any math.\n  The rocket equation tells us that the amount of energy a rocket must expend to go from the Earth\u2019s surface to an orbit 250 kilometers above, called low Earth orbit, is almost thrice as much as going from that low Earth orbit to the Moon! Likewise, getting to low Earth orbit costs twice as much energy than what is required to reach Mars from that same orbit. 1\n Even if we include the energy expenditure to land on the Moon instead of just reaching it from low Earth orbit, getting to Earth orbit itself turns out to be about 50% more expensive. In other words, attaining Earth orbit is the first and the most significant barrier to space exploration.\n  The giant leap for humanity was not stepping on the Moon but getting to Earth orbit.\n The rocket equation doesn\u2019t just dictate how much energy you must spend to reach various destinations in space but also if you can reach space at all.\n  The satellite is but a small fraction of the total mass of the rocket that lifts it and yet has an effect on the rocket itself. Therein lies the core problem of rocket science.\n Increasing the satellite\u2019s mass, to make it more useful perhaps, also means more rocket fuel is required to put the satellite in the desired orbit. But more fuel makes the system weigh more. This means some more fuel is required to launch the now-heavier system into space. As a thumb rule, fuel requirements increase  exponentially with every step increase in mass added to the satellite.\n This is how we end up with rockets being mostly fuel and then some metal. Even the mighty Saturn V that sent astronauts to the Moon was 85% fuel, 13% rocket\u2014including the rocket body, its plumbing and parts\u2014and the rest 2% being the Moonbound spacecraft with astronauts sitting inside!\n  At this point, if we were to make Earth more massive, a rocket would have to expend an enormous amount of energy against a more gruesome gravity well. More fuel would be required to get to space, and your rocket might be something akin to 9 times more fuel than metal. Increase Earth\u2019s mass further and the fuel-to-mass ratio would start  skyrocketing to a point where it\u2019s simply not possible to engineer such a near-all-fuel rocket!\n Crunching the numbers in this manner, it turns out that if the Earth was 50% more massive, you simply wouldn\u2019t be able to get to space even with the most energetic fuel combination\u2014liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen\u2014available in chemical rockets.\n Such a massive rocky planet is not imaginary, several of its kind exist. Of the over 4,000 planets around other stars we\u2019ve discovered to date in our galaxy, about a thousand are something scientists call \u2018Super Earths\u2019. These are planets which are up to 10 times more massive than Earth and up to twice as large. Beyond that limit, planets don\u2019t remain rocky and start turning into  Uranus- or  Neptune-like gas giants.\n  Many of these Super Earths lie in the respective habitable zones around their stars i.e. conditions there could support life as we know it. Given that we\u2019ve only searched a small fraction of our galaxy for planets, it\u2019s fair to say there could be millions of Super Earths, many of which could host life.\n If intelligent life were to develop on these Super Earths, they\u2019d have a hard time building rockets that get things off-planet. Since even the most energetic chemical rockets won\u2019t get them to space, they\u2019d be incentivized to build something with more thrust that can, like nuclear propulsion based rockets. These will likely be far more expensive than chemical rockets but sometimes nature doesn\u2019t give you a choice.\n  Just like the rocket equation makes it exponentially harder to get off a planet with added mass to the planet, it also makes it exponentially easier to get off objects with lesser gravity. Now if only we had an object less massive than Earth that is accessible and resourceful.\n  In order for humanity to survive and thrive long term, it makes sense to have a permanent human settlement on Mars as it offers us a relatively benign environment. Doing so would require sending hundreds to thousands of tons of material from Earth to the martian surface via dozens to hundreds of huge rocket launches. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what  SpaceX\u2019s Starship hopes to do. Here\u2019s where our celestial neighbor, the Moon, can make things better.\n The Moon has a much weaker gravity than Earth, allowing rockets to take off with ease. This was most notable during the Apollo missions, when even a spacecraft hosting two astronauts  could make its way to lunar orbit. Moreover, the Moon lies at the outer edge of Earth\u2019s gravity well, meaning it\u2019s easy to escape our planet\u2019s pull completely if launched from the Moon. Almost five times easier in fact.\n If we establish a vast, permanent settlement on the Moon first, we can eventually tap into its resources to launch rockets from the Moon itself. NASA and ISRO missions have discovered  plenty of water ice on the Moon\u2019s poles. It\u2019s possible that future human habitats built from mining the metal-rich lunar soil tap into this water ice for consumption needs. This water can also be split into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. Rockets taking off from an industrially enabled Moonbase can ride the lunar interplanetary highway to reach Mars more efficiently than from Earth.\n  Sure, it would be expensive to build an industrial Moonbase but if the goal is to expand sustainably into the solar system, we\u2019re playing the game on the scale of hundreds to thousands of years. In this large scheme of things, the Moon can be  the rocket platform to build and expand a sustainable Mars presence for much cheaper than an equivalent one done from Earth.\n The Moon\u2019s accessibility, low gravity barrier, and resource potential are the reason why its proponents vouch for a sustainable return to the Moon first rather than targeting Mars. As the saying within the lunar circles goes:\n     The Moon\u2019s advantages may extend to making homes for ourselves in the outer solar system as well. The rocket equation tells us that even if objects in the outer reaches of the solar system may be closer to Mars than the Moon, the more massive red planet\u2019s deeper gravity well means more energy is required to get out of it than to reach those destinations from there.\n Getting to the asteroid belt from the Moon\u2019s surface is at least 40% less energy demanding for a rocket than from Mars\u2019 surface\u2014even though Mars is about  75 million kilometers closer to the belt! This is the difference gravity makes, and which the rocket equation allows us to see. The Moon can accelerate expanding our settlements to these resource-rich asteroids. Some of these objects, like Ceres and Vesta, can in turn play the same role as the Moon can for Mars and the asteroid belt, and expand human settlements to moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond.\n  This finally brings us to the single most important takeaway from the rocket equation. The ability to extract and harness raw materials from low-gravity, resourceful space objects would free us from the tyranny of dragging everything out of Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\n We cannot hope to be traveling among the stars if we don\u2019t even expand into the solar system in an Earth-independent way and avail for ourselves a much larger resource pool. In-space manufacturing and industrialization is not just a good-to-have but a fundamental requirement for  expansion into the solar system.

Here we present a novel approach forestimating the spatial distribution of surveillance cameras: applying computervision algorithms to large-scale street view image data. Specifically, we builda camera detection model and apply it to 1.6 million street view images sampledfrom 10 large U.S. cities and 6 other major cities around the world, withpositive model detections verified by human experts. After adjusting for theestimated recall of our model, and accounting for the spatial coverage of oursampled images, we are able to estimate the density of surveillance camerasvisible from the road. Across the 16 cities we consider, the estimated numberof surveillance cameras per linear kilometer ranges from 0.1 (in Seattle) to0.9 (in Seoul). In a detailed analysis of the 10 U.S. cities, we find thatcameras are concentrated in commercial, industrial, and mixed zones, and inneighborhoods with higher shares of non-white residents -- a pattern thatpersists even after adjusting for land use. These results help inform ongoingdiscussions on the use of surveillance technology, including its potentialdisparate impacts on communities of color.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:28:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8857\u9053,prevalence,\u76d1\u63a7", "title": "\u4f30\u7b97\u8857\u9053\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728 ", "title_en": "Estimating the Prevalence of Surveillance Cameras with Street View Data", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01764", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8857\u9053", "\u76d1\u63a7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066817, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u89e3\u91ca\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u5212\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4ee4\u724c\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u7684\u5b57\u8282\u987a\u5e8f\u6807\u8bb0\u88ab\u8df3\u8fc7\uff0c\u5c31\u597d\u50cf\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u7a7a\u767d\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u89c6\u56fe\u6216\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5c1d\u8bd5\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4ee5\u524d\uff0c\u89c6\u56fe\u7684ROWID\u5c06\u662f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u7a7a\u7684\u3002 -dsqlite_allow_rowid_in_view\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9009\u9879\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u9700\u8981\u5b83\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9057\u7559\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9ed8\u8ba4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u542f\u7528\u4e86SQLite3_Deserialize\uff08\uff09\u548cSQLite3_Serialize\uff08\uff09\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981-dsqlite_enable_deserialize\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9009\u9879\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65b0\u7684-dsqlite_omit_deserialize\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9009\u9879\u4ee5\u7701\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a5\u53e3\u3002 \uff06\uff0334; memdb\uff06\uff0334;\u53ea\u8981\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u540d\u79f0\u4ee5\uff06\u201c/\uff06\u201d/\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334; /\uff06\uff0334;\u8fd4\u56de\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff08SQLite 3.35.0\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c8B\u9879\uff0c\u66f4\u6539\u65e5\u5fd7\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd4\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u6162\u5730\u51cf\u6162\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\n  \u5355\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4e2d\u7684SQLite\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5217\u8868\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002 SQLite\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7ad9\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bcf\u79cd\u529e\u7406\u767b\u673a\u624b\u7eed\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002 ", "note_en": "Improvement to the  EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN output to make it easier to understand.

prove inadequate to cover the costs of unprecedented joblessness caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a new report warns.\n Even as the economy is rebounding, unemployment remains high, and the debt is forecast to grow beyond the $24.3 billion estimated for the end of this year, state officials said.\n Business leaders said Friday that as borrowing from the federal unemployment trust fund is paid back by higher payroll taxes, state officials must tap more of a projected budget surplus to lessen the financial hit on employers already struggling to recover from the economic shutdown of the last year.\n \u201cIf they don\u2019t do anything more, businesses are going to end up having to pay that tax at a critical time of our economic recovery,\u201d said Rob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable. \u201cIf some [businesses] are teetering on the edge of a fiscal cliff, it could drive them right over the edge, and they go out of business.\u201d\n  California has processed a record 22.5 million unemployment claims since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020, and the state has paid $150 billion in benefits.\n The report, released this week by the state Employment Development Department, poses a new challenge for Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators after months of unresolved problems with the unemployment system.\n Employers pay federal and state taxes into unemployment insurance funds on behalf of each employee on their payroll. When the fund runs low, states can tap into assistance from the federal government to ensure that regular benefit payments can continue to be paid.\n But  money borrowed from the federal government is paid back through an increase in the payroll tax that gradually rises each year, hitting more than 3% after 10 years, until the debt is repaid.\n  The EDD debt forecast report noted that employer contributions are estimated to increase from $4.8 billion this year to $6 billion next year. The independent Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates that the total debt may not be paid off until 2031.\n The expanding debt has touched off a dispute among state leaders over how much of the surplus should be put toward reducing the burden on businesses.\n Newsom recently announced that the state is projected to have a tax windfall of $76 billion, in addition to $27 billion the state will receive from the federal American Rescue Plan.\n   \u201cIt shows the commitment we have to get a jump-start on that payment,\u201d Newsom said last month, when he unveiled his budget proposal. \u201cEvery state in the country will struggle over the course of many, many years to pay back that debt, as we did in the last recession, the Great Recession, when it took a number of years.\u201d\n During the recession of a decade ago, California borrowed $10.7 billion from the federal trust fund to pay unemployment benefits; it took the state from 2011 to 2018 to repay the debt.\n This time, California is one of 19 states that have had to borrow a combined $53 billion from the federal trust fund to cover unemployment benefits during the pandemic. Other states that took loans include Massachusetts, Illinois, New York and Texas, but California has borrowed the most by far \u2014 more than 40% of the total.\n The $1.1 billion proposed by the governor is \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d according to Jennifer Barrera, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce.\n  \u201cHowever, in order to protect small businesses and other employers devastated by the pandemic from the risk of increased taxes and more economic uncertainty, the state needs to be far more aggressive in paying off the entire debt as soon as possible,\u201d Barrera said.\n As an alternative to Newsom\u2019s plan, the Legislature has proposed $2 billion in payroll tax credits to small employers, spread over 10 years. The two sides are still negotiating on the proposals, and Lapsley has proposed that a working group be formed to resolve the issue. He said even the legislative proposal of $200 million a year is not enough to prevent burdensome tax increases on businesses, and would hit the service and hospitality industries especially hard.\n The state\u2019s response to the unemployment system debt has been called inadequate by some lawmakers.\n \u201cIf it is not addressed in a significantly and substantial way, it will lead to higher taxes paid for and by our already struggling small businesses,\u201d said Assemblyman Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield), vice chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee.\n  Some legislators noted that EDD officials said the agency has identified at least $11 billion in benefits paid on fraudulent claims. While the vast majority of fraud occurred on claims in a federal program, some of the fraud payments are liabilities of the state.\n \u201cThis debt was incurred because of the mismanagement of our state government, not by our local small businesses,\u201d Fong told colleagues during Monday\u2019s floor debate on the budget. \u201cThe lack of action will only lead to a higher tax burden that hardworking Californians will have to bear in the future.\u201d\n In October, the EDD thought California\u2019s loan balance might hit $48 billion this year, but the estimate was revised downward after some officials cited factors that include many employers transitioning large numbers of employees to remote working.\n   \u201cThe bottom line is that saddling California businesses with what is estimated to amount to a $26.7-billion tax increase or more over the next 10 years will divert resources away from their ability to regain losses sustained during the pandemic shutdowns and will hamper California\u2019s overall economic recovery,\u201d said Barrera.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:27:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5931\u4e1a,unemployment", "title": "\u52a0\u5dde\u7684\u5931\u4e1a\u503a\u52a1\u968f\u7740\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u51fa\u5e2e\u52a9\u800c\u589e\u957f ", "title_en": "California\u2019s unemployment debt grows as businesses ask Newsom for help", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-18/california-unemployment-debt-grows-businesses-ask-newsom-for-help", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5931\u4e1a"]}]
