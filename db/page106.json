", "note_en": "Vancouver\u2019s  SoleSavy, a sneaker community dedicated to giving fans a curated place to navigate the world of shoes, with all of its drops, news and rumors, has raised a $12.5 million Series A just months after wrapping a $2 million seed round, showcasing investor enthusiasm behind vertical-specific premium social experiences. The round was led by Bedrock Capital with participation from Dapper Labs\u2019 CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Diplo, Bessemer Ventures and Turner Novak\u2019s Banana Capital, among others.\n CEO Dejan Pralica says the company has tripled its user base since its seed raise late last year, while growing its team from 10 to 37 employees in the same period.\n  Today, SoleSavy\u2019s community is based largely around a network of Slack groups where users can discuss just about everything. Though the platform\u2019s chat communities are organized in Slack now, Pralica sees a future where the company could build its own chat hub for members, something to further tie-in the startup\u2019s app, website and online conversations. The more near-term goal is to grow this community into a hub of trusted buyers and sellers where a peer-to-peer member marketplace can thrive. SoleSavy is at the forefront of a new generation of more social internet marketplaces where vertical-specific communities can gather and grow inside an all-encompassing platform.\n \u201cI do envision on end-to-end platform that\u2019s very integrated,\u201d Pralica tells TechCrunch.\u201dI want to make sneakers fun again and enjoyable for the people that are passionate about them.\u201d\n Part of that fun has been diminished by free-for-all chat groups that can quickly grow toxic or grow exploitative as moderators look to cash in on their networks, something SoleSavy hopes a more curated approach can bring back.\n  As my boss (and TC\u2019s resident sneaker head) Matthew said in his  write-up of SoleSavy\u2019s seed raise earlier this year:\n That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy\u2019s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis\u2026 I\u2019ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to re-sell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That\u2019s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.\n The company\u2019s sizable Series A raise just months after a seed showcases that plenty of investors are intrigued by the idea of verticalized marketplaces built up around social communities, Pralica sees the funding as a chance to ignore fundraising for a while and focus on \u201cbuilding for the future\u201d while identifying new opportunities in the sneakersphere.\n SoleSavy has been pretty focused on North American sneaker heads so far, but Pralica see that hefty Series A check taking the platform into new markets, including Australia and New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan and broader Europe. The company also plans to use the new funding to build out its editorial network with podcasts, editorial features, original video and member events.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:46:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u793e\u533a,build,pralica", "title": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u978b\u793e\u533a\u542f\u52a8Solesavy\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861250\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684A\u7cfb\u5217A\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684Sneakersphere ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSneaker community startup SoleSavy raises $12.5 million Series A to build an end-to-end sneakersphere\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/sneaker-community-startup-solesavy-raises-12-5-million-series-a-to-build-an-end-to-end-sneakersphere/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u793e\u533a", "build", "pralica"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3f6f0a8f4ad36656b129a8e2cfae5448.jpg", "infoid": 1067245, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6765\u81eaAmblin\u548cNetflix\u9ad8\u7ba1\u7684\u53d1\u5149\u62a5\u4ef7\uff0c\u5c11\u6570\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f\uff0cAmblin\u5c06\u4e3aNetflix\u751f\u4ea7\u201c\u6bcf\u5e74\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7535\u5f71\u201d\u3002\n \u201c\u4eceTED [Sarandos\uff0cNetflix Co-Ceo\u548c\u9996\u5e2d\u5185\u5bb9\u5b98\u5458]\u548c\u6211\u5f00\u59cb\u8ba8\u8bba\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f88\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u8bb2\u8ff0\u65b0\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u5e76\u4ee5\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fbe\u5230\u89c2\u4f17\uff0c\u201dSpielberg\u8bf4\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\n  \u51e0\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u5f53\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9Spielberg\u636e\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u5b66\u9662\u5956\u9879\u4e2d\u7684Netflix\u7535\u5f71\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8fd9\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u3002\n \u201c\u4e00\u65e6\u4f60\u63d0\u4ea4\u7535\u89c6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u662f\u7535\u89c6\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u201dSpielberg\u4e8e2019\u5e743\u6708\u544a\u8bc9ITV\u3002\u201c\u6211\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u521a\u521a\u7ed9\u4e88\u51e0\u4e2a\u5267\u9662\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u8d44\u683c\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5468\u5e94\u8be5\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u4e3a\u5b66\u9662\u5956\u63d0\u540d\u3002\u201c\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6ca1\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u52a8\u3002\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u4f2f\u683c\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u6b6a\u66f2\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ea\u662f\u8bfb\u4e86\u623f\u95f4\uff0c\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u953b\u70bc\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u3002\u4ed6\u66fe\u8bf4\u8fc7\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u73cd\u60dc\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u201c\u620f\u5267\u7ecf\u5386\u201d - \u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u7247\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u9a71\u4e4b\u4e00\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u7684Netflix\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6c28\u6c28\u578b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1Spielberg\u56fe\u7247\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0cAmblin\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u66f4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5206\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u7528\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u516c\u53f8\u7834\u788e\u4e86\u9762\u5305\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7531Netflix\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u548c\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n \u4e5f\u8bb8\u5b83\u662fCovid\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u4f2f\u683c\u548c\u963f\u535a\u6797\uff0c\u5a92\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u662f\u8fdc\u79bb\u5916\u56fd\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u662f\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u620f\u5267\u7ecf\u5386\u201d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u666e\u904d\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u4eba\u4eec\u5b8c\u5168\u4e50\u610f\u89c2\u770b\uff08\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\uff09\u5bb6\u91cc\u7684\u201cPremiere\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7528\u62f3\u6253\u6eda\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u4e8b\u60c5\u53cd\u5f39\u3002 ", "note_en": "The deal,  announced in a press release with few details except glowing quotes from Amblin and Netflix executives. All that is certain is that Amblin will produce \u201cmultiple new feature films per year\u201d for Netflix.\n \u201cFrom the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,\u201d said Spielberg in the release.\n  Those new ways didn\u2019t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.\n \u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie,\u201d Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind, or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect \u201cthe theatrical experience\u201d \u2014 understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.\n Naturally it\u2019s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there\u2019s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.\n Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the \u201ctheatrical experience\u201d is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a \u201cpremiere\u201d at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:46:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7535\u5f71,amblin", "title": "Spielberg\u7684Amblin\u58a8\u6c34\u58a8\u6c34\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7535\u5f71\u5904\u7406Netflix ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSpielberg\u2019s Amblin inks multi-year feature film deal with Netflix\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/spielbergs-amblin-inks-multi-year-feature-film-deal-with-netflix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7535\u5f71", "amblin"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f836ce1f3532f41865e7566a77edcbcf.png", "infoid": 1067243, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0cqu'est-ce qu'une plante\uff1f \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f89\u714c\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u690d\u7269\u751f\u6d3b\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u548c\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u690d\u7269\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u3002 ", "note_en": "What if plants suffered, thought, helped each other? And what if the carrot were an animal like any other? According to Peter Wohlleben, famous German forest engineer and author of the best-seller  The Hidden Life of Trees, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a wolf ripping apart a wild boar or a deer eating an oak seedling, in both cases there is pain and death\u201d (quoted p. 13). The thesis is original, and seems all the more innocuous since none of its defenders call for people to stop cooking plants.\n Is there not in this form of neo-animism, which sees a continuity between human and plant subjective interiority, an element of bad faith? Is not the alleged suffering of plants, Florence Burgat asks, \u201ca new diversion from the cause of animals\u201d (p. 172)? Dominique Lestel, author of  Apologie du carnivore (Apology for Carnivorism), does not hide his polemical intentions: \u201cWhy would it be more ethical to make a carrot suffer than a hare?\u201d (quoted p. 13). In good logic, if the carrot and the hare suffer in equal measure, \u201cit is not ethical\u201d to discriminate between them, to spare animals while savagely killing blades of grass, carrots, and soy sprouts. In this sense, vegetarians are murderers like any other. Just let carnivores enjoy themselves!\n Against this thesis, known as the \u201ccry of the carrot\u201d ( le cri de la carotte), animalists have so far been content to answer two things. On the one hand, plants do not have a nervous system, and so they do not feel pain. On the other hand, carnivores consume animals that are themselves fed on plants. Worse, the production of one animal protein requires 7 to 10 plant proteins. The argument is a strictly accounting one. Even if plant suffering were of the same intensity as animal suffering, omnivores would produce seven to ten times more suffering than plant lovers alone.\n Burgat is not satisfied with these arguments. The first is based on the idea that there can be no suffering without a nervous system. A  handful of biologists, controversial to be sure, follow in Wohlleben\u2019s footsteps and argue that plants have a form of \u201cdiffuse nervous system.\u201d In their view, synaptic activity\u2014electrical signals\u2014on the body of plants functions like a diffuse brain, one that is not concentrated in a single organ, as in animals. As for the second argument, it concedes that killing a carrot is murder, a murder comparable to that of a farm animal. In the eyes of the philosopher, this concession is absurd, pointless.\n Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une plante? (What is a plant?) goes beyond these two arguments by defending the thesis of a radical ontological difference between plant and animal life. According to Burgat, resolving the question of pain, of subjectivity, requires us to focus on how plants give themselves to us, on their phenomenology.\n  The book is divided into three parts: epistemology, ontology, and morals and rights. The first part deals with the knowledge of plants. How does one produce knowledge about plants? Two models of knowledge can be distinguished: homological and analogical. The homological model assimilates plants to animal or human life. The body parts of one correspond to the body parts of the other. This is Wohlleben\u2019s model. Drawing on numerous passages from his book, Burgat easily shows that anthropomorphism is not here a simple method of popularizing science, a pedagogical metaphor; it is taken as a given. The other model of knowledge, the analogical paradigm, is more interesting and more complex. Since we know animals better than plants, since the former are closer to us physically, emotionally, and mentally, the scientific strategy of botanists has long consisted in investigating the unknown in plants based on the animal model\u2014as Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte observes in his works, but also Foucault in  The Order of Things. According to Burgat, this model of knowledge stumbles on at least two fundamental points: plant nutrition and reproduction. Unlike animals, plants are capable of feeding themselves without taking ready-made organic molecules from their environment; they can synthesize the latter from light. Thus, plants do not need to look for food. As for reproduction, some plants reproduce by cutting, \u201cwhich remains unexplained, for lack of finding an analogue elsewhere\u201d (Canguilhem, quoted p. 36). In this mode of reproduction, like comes from like. \u201cA plant,\u201d writes Hegel quoted by Burgat (p. 40), \u201cis an aggregate of a group of individuals which form a single individual, but whose parts are completely self-subsistent.\u201d\n It will be objected that certain plants, for instance carnivorous plants (p. 60), are mixotrophic, capable also of feeding on pre-existing organic constituents. Moreover, plant reproduction is not always asexual; not all plants can grow from a cutting. This is because a good part of the misunderstandings concerning plants stems \u201cfrom the idea that finding an animal feature in a plant organism suffices to extract [this organism] from its category and to place it in the opposite category\u201d (pp. 51-52). No single empirical feature is the truth of an organism. \u201cUnder the analytical eye, empirical features say nothing when taken one by one; they never allow the ontological question to be decided\u201d (p. 52). The organism is the structure and not the sum of its parts. Against analytical methodology, which decomposes the living into its elements, Burgat pleads for a science or an interpretation of forms, of the whole that is formed and transformed.\n  Thus, Florence Burgat propose an ontological study based on a phenomenology of plant life. The investigation focuses on what plants are. The challenge is to understand what substantially differentiates plants from animals by proposing both a negative, privative definition (what they do not have compared to animals) and a positive one (what they have that animals do not have). To understand what is specific to plant life, one must first engage in comparative analysis, which is the means by which philosophy, and not only the current of philosophical anthropology, approaches the \u201cquestion of plant life.\u201d Negatively, the plant has no perception in the psychological sense (p. 55). When the plant has infraperceptions, that is, perceptions without a subject to experience them as its own, it is not necessarily its unity that infraperceives\u2014a unity that is nowhere to be found\u2014but some of its parts. Plants react finely to any corpuscular or undulatory phenomenon, but without forming mental images of it (p. 90).\n There is no interiority, no life of consciousness, no intentionality in plant life: \u201cConsciousness appears only in the primitive reflection of sensation\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 79). Plant life is neither experiential nor restless (p. 102).\n Plants do not have a lived world; their life is immediate. They are among the living beings for whom objects in the world have only one meaning. There is no multivocality of meaning. There is no error experienced as an error, no astonishment at what appears. There is an \u201cabsolutely radical\u201d division between the plant world and the animal world, between the world of \u201cobjective correspondence\u201d and the world of subjective meaning (p. 64). Plants are not individuals, if individuals are indivisible totalities whose division implies destruction (p. 105).\n Finally, plants do not move. Phototropism, or reaction to light, is just that\u2014a reaction. \u201cThe animal,\u201d writes Hans Jonas, \u201ccan freely close and open its jaws whenever it feels like it\u2014to chew, to yawn, or simply to exercise this faculty\u2014and it can stop and reverse every movement in progress\u201d (quoted p. 62). The plant does not have this freedom; it cannot close and open its leaves.\n From the perspective of a positive ontology, Burgat wonders whether the life of the plant might not closely approximate life as a superpowerful and eternal force. In some respects, the plant seems immortal, freed from temporality: Seeds or root fragments suffice for its rebirth. Plants are \u201cdriven by pure growth, unaware of the caesura of birth and the irreversible rupture of death, slowly collapsing in on themselves to relive elsewhere\u201d (p. 83). If the plant is not an individual, then its positive quality may be that it is a  dividuum (according to the expression coined by a biologist quoted by Plessner, p. 105). The plant is \u201cthe greatest chemist among all living beings (...) it builds the elements of its organic development from inorganic substances\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 110). This capacity\u2014this autotrophy\u2014is the mark of its autarchic royalty (p. 130). Whereas for Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss the animal is the most other of all others, that is, the psycho-subjective structure which, sharing a common basis, is the most alien to us, plant life for Burgat is \u201cradical alterity\u201d (p. 129), that which resists all common, lived experience.\n  Is plant life\u2014as defined through the ontological investigation\u2014worthy of respect? The philosopher shares with L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Francis Hall\u00e9 a certain repugnance for the felling of trees. Their destruction as well as \u201cthe ransacking and pollution of natural environments are reproved for their consequences and for what they are in themselves: a repugnant attitude\u201d (p. 144). This repugnance appears to be an intuition, the first answer that comes to mind when we are summoned to answer the question \u201cis it right to cut down the tree that is standing over there, right in front of me, and has been around for decades?\u201d But is this intuition correct? Is it reprehensible to cut down a hundred hundred-year-old oaks to rebuild the framework of Notre-Dame Cathedral (p. 148)? If it is reprehensible, is our repugnance consistent with the principle of attributing fundamental rights to plants?\n Burgat does not definitively settle these questions. In terms of content, she sides with Rousseau and Bentham. Sensibility is a necessary and sufficient condition to be a bearer of rights. In terms of form, she points out that, from a strictly technical point of view, nothing prevents the legislator from protecting the interests of humans in the environment, if they consider these interests sufficiently important to set up a specific protection, or to protect such and such a species of flower, or such and such a tree that is particularly remarkable for aesthetic reasons. One may well call legal \u201crights\u201d these types of rights which are conceptually indirect. If historical monuments can be protected (p. 153), then so can plants.

Maybe you should improve your hiring process. How do you track what they are getting done now?\n I don&#39;t know. Now I walk around and ask them, and we have meetings where we talk about it; if I&#39;m not around how would I know if they were slacking off?\n Maybe you should work to improve what you measure and how you encourage feedback. It is normally a good idea to have ways to tell if people are doing a good job for what you are paying them to do.\n But if I can\u2019t see them to make sure they are working, then I can\u2019t manage them.\n Sounds like you need to level up as a manager. There are other skills to improve how you manage different types of teams and working styles. Your job as a leader is to have a productive team; take ownership of this and adjust to running a productive team in a new way.\n But we can\u2019t let our people not see each other, they won\u2019t communicate well.\n People coordinate large projects all the time without being in the same place. You might want to think about improving your processes. Some simple changes could improve your communication.\n  The last year isn&#39;t typical remote work; most companies were rushing to move away from the office, but were not embracing remote work. Remote work, if done well, is not a day full of Zoom meetings. GitLab, a $6B company, has a guide that might be an  interesting read. In it, they say that the company is in the  Skeumorph phase when they just do everything the same way, but not in the same place. You can mature past this into later phases where you don&#39;t spend so much on video calls.\n I&#39;m a manager, if I spend less time in meetings, what am I going to be doing all day?\n I appreciate the honesty; that sounds like a great problem to have. Thinking strategically, helping to grow your people, writing documents that would have been meetings. You will be plenty busy, just in a different way.\n  Sounds like if they want to and you don\u2019t let them, they will leave to one of the many companies that let them. I hope none of them are your  competitors.\n But we are paying all this money for office space, I don&#39;t want to waste that.\n That is ultimately your call. Depending on your business,  losing a few key employees might be worse that eating a year of a lease. Depending on your business, reducing in-person meetings, being able to hire talented people a few hours away, and having happier more loyal employees might be less important than a big lease cost. Also, you might be experiencing the  Sunk Cost Fallacy.\n I don&#39;t want to change the way I work, I just want people to join me in the office. My kids are driving me crazy. Is it weird to say I&#39;m lonely; I miss my office friends.\n The office has some great things going for it. Have you ever sat down and listed them and thought about how more established companies make sure those things happen without an office? You might be surprised.

And nearly 40% of high earners \u2014 those making more than $100,000 annually \u2014 said they live that way.\n That means high-earning millennials aren&#39;t the only ones feeling stretched thin, but they feel that way more than their six-figure-making peers. Living on constrained budgets may therefore have less to do with income and more to do with expenses, the report said.\n     That&#39;s partly because of lifestyle choices. Many of these millennials are likely  HENRYs \u2014 short for high earner, not rich yet. The acronym was invented in 2003, but it has come to characterize a certain group of 30-something six-figure earners who struggle to balance their spending and savings habits.\n HENRYs typically fall victim to  lifestyle creep, when one increases one&#39;s standard of living to match a rise in discretionary income. They prefer a comfortable and often expensive lifestyle that leaves them living paycheck to paycheck.\n        As the report said, &#34;Living paycheck to paycheck sometimes carries connotations of barely scraping by and of poverty. The reality of a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle in the United States today is much more complex, and the current economic environment has made it even more complicated.&#34;\n It cited the example of a college-educated 35-year-old earning more than $100,000 while juggling a mortgage, student-loan debt, and a child, which could leave them with little savings for big purchases or unexpected emergencies.\n The generation is facing an  affordability crisis. Income increases simply  have not kept up with an exponential increase in living costs, and the pandemic hasn&#39;t helped matters by throwing job loss and  pay cuts into the mix.\n The cost of education has also more than doubled since the 1970s, leaving many millennials with student debt. Priya Malani, the founder of  Stash Wealth, a financial firm that works with HENRYs,  previously told Insider that 40% of her clients had student loans. On average, they owed $80,000.\n     As a byproduct of this increased cost in living, the middle class has been shrinking.

Other preliminary evidence puts  humans in central Mexico as early as around 33,000 years ago ( SN: 7/22/20).\n The latest evidence comes from animal bones that biological anthropologist and archaeologist Andrew Somerville and two Mexican colleagues found stored in a Mexico City lab. The bones had been excavated in the 1960s at a rock-shelter called Coxcatlan Cave.\n Radiocarbon analyses of six rabbit bones from the site\u2019s deepest sediment  yielded unexpectedly old ages, the researchers report online May 19 in  Latin American Antiquity. That sediment also contained chipped and sharp-edged stones regarded as tools by the site\u2019s lead excavator.\n Higher sediment layers yielded clearer examples of stone tools and other remnants of human activity dating to nearly 9,900 years ago. \u00a0Somerville, of\u00a0Iowa State University in Ames, initially suspected that rabbit bones from the deepest sediment were perhaps around 12,000 years old. But analyses revealed they were much older, hinting humans were living in the cave roughly 30,000 years ago.\n Somerville will next determine whether other animal bones from the ancient sediment display butchery marks, breaks where marrow was removed or burned patches from cooking. He also wants to locate and study possible stone tools from that same sediment that may be stored in the same lab.\n Based on additional radiocarbon dates and comparisons with stone-tool finds from other Mexican sites, Somerville suspects that a separate occupation of Coxcatlan Cave occurred between 13,500 and 9,900 years ago. Regional food and water sources may have dwindled when the last Ice Age peaked between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago, causing the earliest settlers to leave and delaying further occupations \u00a0until conditions improved, Somerville speculates.\n   A.

Maybe we should not have added  signed-by, people seem to forget that debs still run maintainer scripts as root.\n Aside from this email, Debian users should look into  extrepo, which manages curated external repositories for you.\n        Older (and all) releases only support unarmored files with an extension .gpg. If you care about them, provide one, and use\n  Some people will tell you to download the  .asc and pipe it to  gpg --dearmor, but  gpg might not be installed, so really, just offer a  .gpg one instead that is supported on all systems.\n      People say it\u2019s good practice to  not use  trusted.gpg.d and install the file elsewhere and then refer to it from the  sources.list entryby using  signed-by=&lt;path to the file&gt;. So this looks a lot safer, because now your key can\u2019t sign other unrelated repositories. Inpractice, security increase is minimal, since package maintainer scripts run as root anyway. But I guess it\u2019s better for publicity :)\n As an example, here are the instructions to install  signal-desktop from signal.org. As mentioned,  gpg --dearmor use in there is not a good idea, and I\u2019d personally not tell people to modify  /usr as it\u2019s supposed to be managed by the package manager, but we don\u2019t have an  /etc/apt/keyrings or similar at the moment; it\u2019s fine though if the keyring is installed by the package. You can also just add the file there as a starting point, and then installa keyring package overriding it (pretend there is a signal-desktop-keyring package below that would override the .gpg we added).\n # NOTE: These instructions only work for 64 bit Debian-based# Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Mint etc.# 1. Install our official public software signing keywget -O- https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor &gt; signal-desktop-keyring.gpgcat signal-desktop-keyring.gpg | sudo tee -a /usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg &gt; /dev/null# 2.

Update your package database and install signalsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install signal-desktop\n I do wonder why they do  wget | gpg --dearmor, pipe that into the file and then  cat | sudo tee it, instead of having that all in one pipeline. Maybe they want nicer progress reporting.\n   For system image building, shipping the key in  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d seems reasonable to me; you are the vendor sort of, so it can be globally trusted.\n Chrome-style debs and repository config debs: If you ship a deb, embedding the  sources.list.d snippet (calling it  $myrepo.list) and shipping a  $myrepo.gpg in  /usr/share/keyrings is the best approach. Whether you ship that in product debs aka  vscode/ chromium or provide a repository configuration deb (let\u2019s call it  myrepo-repo.deb) and then tell people to run  apt update followed by  apt install &lt;package inside the repo&gt; depends on how many packages are in the repo, I guess.\n Manual instructions (signal style): The third case, where you tell people to run  wget themselves, I find tricky.As we see in signal, just stuffing keyring files into  /usr/share/keyrings is popular, despite  /usr supposed to be managed by the package manager.We don\u2019t have another dir inside  /etc (or  /usr/local), so it\u2019s hard to suggest something else.There\u2019s no significant benefit from actually using  signed-by, so it\u2019s kind of extra work for little gain, though.\n  This part is new, just for this blog post.

That transaction wasn\u2019t completed until the third quarter of 2020 other than in Mexico, which closed in January 2021. This latest agreement, which was reached June 18 and reported Monday, will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber.\n The deal suggests Uber\u2019s bullishness in delivery hasn\u2019t waned. With Cornershop as wholly owned subsidiary, Uber can beef up its grocery delivery options, a service made popular during the pandemic. Uber started offering grocery delivery  in select cities across Latin America, Canada and the U.S. last summer after it acquired Postmates in a deal valued at  $2.65 billion. Uber faces stiff competition from grocery retailers themselves, many of whom offer delivery through partnering with startups like DoorDash or Favor Fleet.\n  Cornershop, which is headquartered in Chile, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. The company expanded its operations to eight countries up and down the Americas, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the U.S. and Canada. The company raised  $31.7 million over four rounds of funding from investors that include Accel and Jackson Square Ventures.\n Uber wasn\u2019t the only grocery service with its eyes on Cornershop; the startup was supposed to be acquired by Walmart in a $225 million deal, but it ultimately fell through after Mexican anti-trust regulators blocked the deal from moving forward.

The company announced today that some US-based public figures, as well as certain groups, can start hosting rooms through the main Facebook iOS app. (People can join, however, from both iOS and Android.) Anyone can be invited up as a speaker with up to 50 people able to speak at once. There\u2019s no cap on the number of listeners allowed in \u2014 a major shot at Clubhouse, which imposes room size limitations.\n It\u2019s also introducing other nifty features, like notifications when your friends or followers join a room, as well as live captions. There will be a \u201craise a hand\u201d button to request to join the conversation, and reactions will be available to to interact throughout the chat. Twitter Spaces, Twitter\u2019s live audio feature, includes captions, but Clubhouse still does not.\n Within groups, admins can control who\u2019s allowed to create a room: moderators, group members, or other admins. Public group chats will be accessible both in and outside the group, but private group chats will be restricted to members. Additionally, hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation with a button to directly donate showing up on the chat. Again, this feels like a feature directly built to address a key Clubhouse use case and make it frictionless. (Many Clubhouse creators have hosted fundraisers on the app but have to direct people to outside links in order to facilitate donations.)\n   Additionally, Facebook is making podcasts available on the platform, confirming earlier   Verge reporting. People will be able to listen to podcasts through either a mini-player or a full-screen player with various playback controls, including the ability to listen while the screen is off. They\u2019ll be able to find shows on specific podcast creators\u2019 Pages, as well as in the News Feed, and they can react to, comment, bookmark, and share their favorites. The Facebook team says it plans to roll out automatic captioning later this summer, as well as a clips feature where listeners can create and share their favorite clips.\n All these features come  just days after Spotify debuted its own live audio app, Greenroom;  three months since Stage Channels came to Discord;  four months after Reddit Talk; roughly  seven months after Twitter launched Spaces; and about 15 months after Clubhouse first launched.  LinkedIn and  Slack are, reportedly, working on their own versions of an audio product, even as  downloads of and  buzz around Clubhouse itself have waned considerably.\n   Unlike Clubhouse, which drew in early listeners by giving them auditory access to Silicon Valley hot shots, Facebook is hoping to cast a broader net of influencers with Live Audio Rooms. Among the named public figures who will have access to the feature on launch will be musicians (TOKiMONSTA, D Smoke, Kehlani); media figures (Joe Budden, DeRay Mckesson); and athletes (Russell Wilson, Omareloff). Joe Budden will also distribute his podcast through Facebook.\n Audio rooms may or may not be a feature with real staying power, but Facebook seems intent on investing broadly in the space.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:50:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,\u63a8\u51fa,launches,\u529f\u80fd", "title": "Facebook\u63a8\u51fa\u5176\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u514b\u9686 ", "title_en": "Facebook Launches Its Clubhouse Clone", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launches", "\u529f\u80fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067234, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\uff1a\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u7684CI\u4ece\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u629b\u5f03\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u6539\u4e3a\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97QA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8bb0\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u6613\u4e8e\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002\n  \u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Jenkins\u3002 Jenkins\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u9996\u9009\u7684CI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u7528\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u5176\u8d85\u7ea7\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5f52\u6863\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f7f\u7528ArchiveARtifacts Pipeline\u547d\u4ee4\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u7684QA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n \u5f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u8003\u8651\u5b83\u51c6\u5907QA\u65f6\uff0cQA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4e0b\u8f7dPR\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u5728Github\u4e0a\u6258\u7ba1\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Gi\u200b\u200btHub CI\u3002\n \u6211\u9884\u8ba1\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u6211\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002 GitHub\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u7269\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff1a\n \u4f2a\u50cf\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u7684zip\u4e2d\u6346\u7ed1\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\uff1a\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684acos\uff0cwindows\u548clinux\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002 \n\u4e00\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u751f\u4ea7\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\u53eb\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eaf\u7968\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u611f\u89c9\u50cf\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8865\u507f\u4e22\u5931\u7684github\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n \u7531\u4e8e\u6211\u6258\u7ba1vps\u4e0a\u7684\u535a\u5ba2\uff0c\u6211\u6700\u7ec8\u505a\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u6b63\u5728vps\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\uff08builds.agateau.com\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06github\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u6211\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684ssh\u3002\n  \u6211\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u662fHTTP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5728\u6211\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u5546\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b50\u57df\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u6211\u7684vps\u4e0a\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u7f6e\u4e86nginx\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95ee\uff06\uff0334;

This makes it easy to provide QA engineers or bug reporters with new builds to try.\n  I first experienced this setup at work, where we use Jenkins. Jenkins is  not my preferred CI system, but to its credit, it makes it super easy to implement this feature: add a step to archive artifacts, either using the GUI or using the  archiveArtifacts pipeline command.\n We actually do this for all builds at work, not only master branch builds. It makes the life of our QA engineers much easier. Our workflow looks like this:\n when developers consider it ready to QA, QA engineers download the artifacts produced by the PR build and use them to validate the work.\n  I thought it would be a good idea to setup something similar for my own projects, which are hosted on GitHub and use GitHub CI.\n I expected a feature like this to be readily available, but I could not find exactly what I wanted. GitHub provides a way to download artifacts from a build but it&#39;s not ideal:\n Artifacts are all bundled together in a big zip, which is inconvenient when building multi-platform apps: no-one wants to download a single archive containing the same application for macOS, Windows and Linux.\n Some projects use tags to produce main branch builds, but I don&#39;t like this idea. Call me a purist, but using tags that way feels like subverting the concept to compensate for a missing GitHub feature.\n Since I host my blog on a VPS, what I ended up doing is setting up a subdomain for builds on the VPS ( builds.agateau.com) and making GitHub upload artifacts to my server over SSH.\n  The first thing I set up was the HTTP server to serve the files. After adding the subdomain on my registrar, I created a directory on my VPS and configured Nginx so that users visiting &#34;builds.agateau.com&#34; would be able to browse and download the content of this directory, using the  Nginx Fancy Index module.\n   I then created a  build user on the VPS, created one directory per project in  /srv/builds.agateau.com/html and made the  build user the owner of these directories so that it can write to them.\n Finally I created an SSH key for this user, so that the GitHub builder can connect to it.\n  I looked into existing GitHub actions for SSH uploads but it all felt overkill for just an  scp call. Instead I decided to keep it simple: my build is going to call a shell script to do the upload. I prefer keeping dependencies with the CI to a minimum anyway, it makes it easier to test build scripts locally instead of using the commit-push-and-pray &#34;workflow&#34;.\n  #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail PROGNAME = $(basename  $0 )die ()  {  echo  &#34; $PROGNAME :  $* &#34; &gt; &amp; 2  exit  1 } # Check $1 is defined and not emptycheck_var ()  {  local  name = $1  if ! env  | grep -q  &#34;^ $name =..*&#34;  ;  then die  &#34;Environment variable  $name  is not set or is empty&#34;  fi }usage ()  {  if  [  &#34; $* &#34; ! =  &#34;&#34;  ]  ;  then  echo  &#34;Error:  $* &#34;  echo  fi cat  &lt;&lt; EOF Usage: $PROGNAME [OPTION ...] &lt;project&gt; &lt;build_file&gt; [build_file...] Uploads build artifacts to a server using scp.

I find that it helps when revisiting them 6 months later (I wrote about my  shell script template some time ago if you are interested).\n This script takes the name of the project, which matches the directory created on the server for it, and the files to upload. Sensitive information (username, host name and private key) is provided through environment variables.\n Note: I had to disable host-key checking (the  -o &#34;StrictHostKeyChecking off&#34; option in the  scp call) because I could not figure out how to pass the host key as an argument or environment variable. I believe in that case it won&#39;t be too bad, the worse that could happen is someone managing to steal the account public key and uploading builds to their server instead of mine. Still I&#39;d prefer to be able to pass the host key. If you know how to do this, I would love to hear from you!\n  I connected to the project GitHub admin page and declared the username, host name and private keys as  GitHub encrypted secrets.\n Now all that was left to do was to call the  upload-build script from the GitHub build workflow.\n Here is  Git Bonsai build workflow, showing how to call  upload-build after each push to the master branch.\n name :  Build on :  [ push ,  pull_request ] jobs :  build :  strategy :  fail-fast :  false  matrix :  os :  -  ubuntu-18.04  -  macos-10.15  -  windows-2019  runs-on :  ${{ matrix.os }}  defaults :  run :  shell :  bash  steps :  -  uses :  actions/ [email\u00a0protected]  -  name :  Build  run :  ci/build-app  -  name :  Run static checks  run :  ci/run-static-checks  -  name :  Run tests  run :  ci/run-tests  -  name :  Create archive  run :  ci/create-archive  -  name :  Upload  if :  github.ref == &#39;refs/heads/master&#39;  run :  ci/upload-build git-bonsai artifacts/*.bz2  env :  UPLOAD_USERNAME :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_USERNAME }}  UPLOAD_PRIVATE_KEY :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_PRIVATE_KEY }}  UPLOAD_HOSTNAME :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_HOSTNAME }}\n  One last thing was required on the server side: to ensure the server disk does not get filled with builds and the build list page does not become too long to load, I added a cleanup script to keep only the latest 30 builds for each project. This script runs every day.\n Here it is, once again it&#39;s a bit longer than what one would expect because of argument parsing:\n #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail PROGNAME = $(basename  $0 ) ROOT_DIR =/srv/builds.agateau.com/html MAX_BUILDS = 30 # Verbose command by default CMD = &#34;rm -v&#34; QUIET_CMD = &#34;rm&#34; DRY_RUN_CMD = &#34;echo Would delete &#34;clean_project_dir ()  {  local  project_dir = &#34; $1 &#34; ls --sort  time --reverse  &#34; $project_dir &#34;  \\  | awk  &#39;NR &gt; &#39; $MAX_BUILDS &#39; { print $1 }&#39;  \\  |  while  read name  do  $CMD  &#34; $project_dir / $name &#34;  done }usage ()  {  if  [  &#34; $* &#34; ! =  &#34;&#34;  ]  ;  then  echo  &#34;Error:  $* &#34;  echo  fi cat  &lt;&lt; EOF Usage: $PROGNAME [OPTION ...] Delete old builds artifacts.

I also made it list builds in descending date order, so that the latest builds are always at the top of the page.\n That&#39;s it, you can have a look at it here:  https://builds.agateau.com/. There are only two projects for now, I plan to add more in the future.\n  I am happy I spent some time setting up this artifact upload system as it has proved useful to let bug reporters confirm a fix after they reported an issue.

Do not get a PhD in history.\n Look, I get it. Of all the people on AskHistorians,  I get it. You don&#39;t &#34;love history;&#34; you love history with everything in your soul and you read history books outside your subfield for fun and you spend 90% of your free time trying to get other people to love history as much as you do, or even a quarter as much, or even just think about it for a few minutes and your day is made. I get it.\n You have a professor who&#39;s told you you&#39;re perfect to teach college. You have a professor who has assured you you&#39;re the exception and will succeed. You have a friend who just got their PhD and has a tenure track job at UCLA. You don&#39;t need an R1 school; you just want to teach so you&#39;d be fine with a small, 4-year liberal arts college position.\n You&#39;ve spent four or six subsistence-level years sleeping on an air mattress and eating poverty burritos and working three part-time jobs to pay for undergrad. You&#39;re not worried about more. Heck, a PhD stipend looks like a pay  raise. Or maybe you have parents or grandparents willing to step in, maybe you have no loans from undergrad to pay back.\n It doesn&#39;t matter.  You are not the exception. Do not get a PhD in history or any of the allied fields.\n There are no jobs. The history job market crashed in 2008, recovered a bit in 2011-12...and then disappeared.  Here is the graph from the AHA. 300 full-time jobs, 1200 new PhDs. Plus all the people from previous years without jobs and with more publications than you. Plus all the current profs in crappy jobs who have more publications, connections, and experience than you. Minus all the jobs not in your field. Minus all the jobs earmarked for senior professors who already have tenure elsewhere. Your obscure subfield will not save you. Museum work is probably more competitive and you will not have the experience or skills. There are no jobs.\n Your job options, as such, are garbage. Adjunct jobs are unliveable pay, no benefits, renewable but not guaranteed, and *disappearing even though a higher percentage of courses are taught by adjuncts. &#34;Postdocs&#34; have all the responsibilities of a tenure track job for half the pay (if you&#39;re lucky), possibly no benefits, and oh yeah, you get to look for jobs all over again in 1-3 years. Somewhere in the world.  This is a real job ad. Your job options are, in fact, garbage.\n It&#39;s worse for women. Factors include: students rate male professors more highly on teaching evals. Women are socialized to take on emotional labor and to &#34;notice the tasks that no one else is doing&#34; and do them because they have to be done. Women use maternity leave to be mothers; fathers use paternity leave to do research. Insane rates of sexual harassment, including of grad students, and uni admins that actively protect male professors. The percentage of female faculty drops for each step up the career ladder you go due to all these factors. I am not aware of research for men of color or women of color (or other-gender faculty at all), but I imagine it&#39;s not a good picture for anyone.\n  History enrollments are crashing because students take their history requirement (if there even still is one) in high school as AP/dual enrollment for the GPA boost, stronger college app, and to free up class options at (U.S.) uni.\n Schools are not replacing retiring faculty. They convert tenure lines to adjunct spots, or more commonly now, just require current faculty to teach more classes.\n Older faculty can&#39;t afford to retire, or don&#39;t want to. Tenure protects older faculty from even being asked if they plan to retire, even if they are incapable of teaching classes anymore.\n A history PhD will not make you more attractive for other jobs. You will have amazing soft skills, but companies want hard ones. More than that, they want direct experience, which you will not have. A PhD might set you back as &#34;overqualified,&#34; or automatically disqualified because corporate/school district rules require a higher salary for PhDs.\n Other jobs in academia? Do you honestly think that those other 1200 new PhDs won&#39;t apply for the research librarianship in the middle of the Yukon? Do you really think some of them won&#39;t have MLIS degrees, and have spent their PhD time getting special collections experience? Do you want to plan your PhD around a job for which there might be one opening per year? Oh! Or you could work in academic administration, and do things like help current grad students make the same mistakes you did.\n You are not the exception. 50% of humanities students drop out before getting their PhD. 50% of PhD students admit to struggling with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues (and 50% of PhD students are lying). People in academia drink more than  skydivers. Drop out or stay in, you&#39;ll have spent 1-10 years not building job experience, salary, retirement savings, a permanent residence, a normal schedule, hobbies. Independently wealthy due to parents or spouse? Fabulous; have fun making history the  gentlemen&#39;s profession again.\n Your program is not the exception. Programs in the U.S. and U.K. are currently reneging on promises of additional funding to students  in progress on their dissertations. Universities are changing deadlines to push current students out the door without adequate time to do the research they need or acquire the skills they&#39;d need for any kind of historical profession job or even if they want a different job, the side experience for that job.\n I called the rough draft of this essay &#34;A history PhD will destroy your future and eat your children.&#34; No. This is not something to be flip about.  Do not get a PhD in history.\n ...But I also  get it, and I know that for some of you, there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can say to stop you from making a colossally bad decision. And I know that some of you in that group are coming from undergrad schools that maybe don&#39;t have the prestige of others, or professors who understand what it takes to apply to grad school and get it. So in comments, I&#39;m giving advice that I hope with everything I am you will not use.\n This is killing me to write. I love history. I spend my free time  talking about history on reddit. You can find plenty of older posts by me saying all the reasons a history PhD is fine. No. It&#39;s not.  You are not the exception. Your program is not the exception. Do not get a PhD in the humanities.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:49:18", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f97\u5230,history", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f60\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u5f97\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u535a\u58eb ", "title_en": "Why You Should Not Get a History PhD", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/96yf9h/monday_methods_why_you_should_not_get_a_history/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f97\u5230", "history"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b4b7da2550a930d7606ecf78ec405dfa.jpeg", "infoid": 1067232, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u52a0\u4e0a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u65e0\u804a\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u6e34\u671b\u518d\u6b21\u65c5\u884c\u3002\n \u671f\u5f85\u590f\u5b63\u65c5\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u7e41\u8363\uff0cAmtrak\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u8005\u4e2d\u5174\u8d77\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u3002 Amtrak\u4e0a\u5468\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u7968\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u82b1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u5728Amtrak\u706b\u8f66\u4e0a\u82b1\u8d39\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u8d39\u7528\u3002\n \u52306\u670822\u65e5\uff0c\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u662f299\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u5e38\u4ef7\u683c\u4e3a499\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u706b\u8f66\u65c5\u884c -  299\u7f8e\u5143\u8d85\u8fc730\u5929\u5185\u8986\u76d610\u4e2a\u94c1\u8def\u6bb5\u3002\n \u6839\u636eAmtrak\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f53\u4e58\u5ba2\u79bb\u5f00\u706b\u8f66\u65f6\uff0c\u4e00\u6bb5\u65c5\u884c\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u7684\u9a91\u884c\u5c06\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bb5\u3002 Amtrak\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u957f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8def\u7ebf - \u5c31\u50cf\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u5230\u5723\u5b89\u4e1c\u5c3c\u5965 - \u62c9\u4f38\u8d85\u8fc71000\u82f1\u91cc\u3002\n      \u7f8e\u56fd\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u884c\u8005\u53ea\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6559\u7ec3\u5e2d\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba9\u4e58\u5ba2\u9884\u8ba2\u7761\u7720\u5ba2\u8231\u6216\u4e00\u6d41\u5e2d\u4f4d\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f4f\u5bbf\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u4e00\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u82b1\u8d39\u6570\u767e\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u7528\u6298\u4ef7\u4ecd\u7136\u662f30\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6298\u6263\u3002\n \u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5230\u65b0\u5965\u5c14\u826f\u76841,377\u82f1\u91cc\u65b0\u6708\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u5f20\u5f80\u8fd4\u673a\u7968\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9760\u8fd1500\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u5c06\u5728\u90a3\u6b21\u72ec\u81ea\u65c5\u884c\u4e4b\u540e\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u4ed8\u51fa\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002\n \u4e70\u5bb6\u5728\u8d2d\u4e70\u5b83\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7f8e\u56fd\u94c1\u8def\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba2\u65c5\u884c120\u5929\uff0c\u6240\u4ee56\u670822\u65e5\u7684\u6298\u6263\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u5c06\u572810\u6708\u4e0b\u65ec\u5230\u671f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u670930\u5929\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u4f7f\u752810\u4e2a\u7ec6\u5206\u3002 \n\u70b9\u51fb\u201c\u6ce8\u518c\u201d\uff0c\u60a8\u540c\u610f\u4eceInsider\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8425\u9500\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a5\u53d7\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6761\u6b3e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u3002  \u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u7ebf; x\uff06\uff0339; \u5b83\u8868\u793a\u5c01\u95ed\u4e92\u52a8\u6216\u89e3\u96c7\u901a\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002 ", "note_en": "After a year-plus of coronavirus-induced stress and boredom, many Americans are eager to travel again.\n Expecting a boom in summer travel, Amtrak is luring in travelers with the relaunch of its USA Rail Pass. The ticket, which Amtrak launched last week, allows people to spend a month crisscrossing the country on Amtrak trains for a flat fee.\n Through June 22, the pass is $299, 40% off its usual price of $499. It doesn&#39;t allow for unlimited train travel \u2014 the $299 covers 10 rail segments over 30 days.\n According to Amtrak, a segment of a trip ends when a passenger gets off a train, so a trip with one connection would use two segments, but one long ride would be only one segment. Amtrak&#39;s longest direct routes \u2014 like Chicago to San Antonio \u2014 stretch more than 1,000 miles.\n      The USA Rail Pass is good for only coach seats and doesn&#39;t let passengers book premium accommodations like sleeper cabins or first-class seats. Still, at $30 a segment, the pass offers massive discounts, given that one segment can cost hundreds of dollars.\n For instance, one round-trip ticket on the 1,377-mile Crescent line from New York to New Orleans can run you close to $500. The USA Rail Pass would pay for itself after that trip alone.\n Buyers have 120 days to book trips using their USA Rail Pass after purchasing it, so a discounted pass bought by June 22 would be good through late October.

The justices rejected the NCAA&#39;s argument that its players&#39; amateur status would be impossible to maintain if they could receive pay, even for education-related expenses.\n  &#34;Put simply, this suit involves admitted horizontal price fixing in a market where the defendants exercise monopoly control,&#34; Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court.\n The conservative justice, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, wrote that it was &#34;unclear exactly what the NCAA seeks.&#34;\n &#34;To the extent it means to propose a sort of judicially ordained immunity from the terms of the Sherman Act for its restraints of trade \u2014 that we should overlook its restrictions because they happen to fall at the intersection of higher education, sports, and money \u2014 we cannot agree,&#34; Gorsuch wrote.\n The outcome was largely expected following  oral argument in March. The decision upheld an injunction imposed by a federal district court that barred the NCAA from limiting &#34;compensation and benefits related to education.&#34; The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier approved of the injunction.\n In allowing the injunction, Gorsuch wrote that the NCAA can ask lawmakers to carve out an exception for it.\n  &#34;The NCAA is free to argue that, &#39;because of the special characteristics of [its] particular industry,&#39; it should be exempt from the usual operation of the antitrust laws \u2014 but that appeal is &#39;properly addressed to Congress,&#39;&#34; Gorsuch wrote.\n &#34;Nor has Congress been insensitive to such requests. It has modified the antitrust laws for certain industries in the past, and it may do so again in the future,&#34; Gorsuch wrote. &#34;But until Congress says otherwise, the only law it has asked us to enforce is the Sherman Act, and that law is predicated on one assumption alone \u2014 &#39;competition is the best method of allocating resources&#39; in the Nation&#39;s economy.&#34;\n The case was originally brought by Shawne Alston, a former West Virginia running back, and other student athletes. The dispute, known as National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Alston, No. 20-512, is separate from the ongoing controversy over NCAA rules that restrict athletes from being paid to play or for doing endorsement deals.\n The latter rules have not yet come before the Supreme Court, and the court&#39;s opinion did not weigh on their legality.\n However, Trump appointee Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested in a blistering concurrence to Monday&#39;s opinion that those rules may also run afoul of antitrust law. He wrote that &#34;The NCAA is not above the law&#34; and that &#34;The NCAA&#39;s business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America.&#34;\n &#34;Everyone agrees that the NCAA can require student athletes to be enrolled students in good standing. But the NCAA&#39;s business model of using unpaid student athletes to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the colleges raises serious questions under the antitrust laws,&#34; Kavanaugh wrote.\n He added that it was &#34;highly questionable whether the NCAA and its member colleges can justify not paying student athletes a fair share of the revenues on the circular theory that the defining characteristic of college sports is that the colleges do not pay student athletes.&#34;\n &#34;And if that asserted justification is unavailing, it is not clear how the NCAA can legally defend its remaining compensation rules,&#34; Kavanaugh wrote.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:48:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Also known as the Precautionary Approach or Precautionary Action, the Precautionary Principle is a concept best summed up by the proverb \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d or the medical maxim to \u201cfirst do no harm.\u201d\n While there is no single definition, it typically refers to acting to prevent harm by not doing anything that could have negative consequences, even if the possibility of those consequences is uncertain.\n In this post, we\u2019ll take a look at how the Precautionary Principle works, its strengths and drawbacks, the best way to use it, and how we can apply it in our own lives.\n  Whenever we make even the smallest change within a complex system, we risk dramatic unintended consequences.\n The interconnections and dependencies within systems make it almost impossible to predict outcomes\u2014and seeing as they often require a reasonably precise set of conditions to function, our interventions can wreak havoc.\n The Precautionary Principle reflects the reality of working with and within complex systems. It shifts the burden of proof from proving something was dangerous after the fact to proving it is safe before taking chances. It emphasizes waiting for more complete information before risking causing damage, especially if some of the possible impacts would be irreversible, hard to contain, or would affect people who didn\u2019t choose to be involved.\n The possibility of harm does not need to be specific to that particular circumstance; sometimes we can judge a category of actions as one that always requires precaution because we know it has a high risk of unintended consequences.\n For example, invasive species (plants or animals that cause harm after being introduced into a new environment by humans) have repeatedly caused native species to become extinct. So it\u2019s reasonable to exercise precaution and not introduce living things into new places without strong evidence it will be harmless.\n  Best known for its use as a regulatory guideline in environmental law and public health, the Precautionary Principle originated with the German term \u201cVorsorgeprinzip\u201d applied to regulations for preventing air pollution. Konrad Von Moltke, director of the Institute for European Environmental Policy, later translated it into English.\n Seeing as the natural world is a highly complex system we have repeatedly disrupted in serious, permanent ways, the Precautionary Principle has become a guiding part of environmental policy in many countries.\n For example, the Umweltbundesamt (German Environmental Protection Agency) explains that the Precautionary Principle has two core components in German environmental law today: preventing risks and protecting resources.\n Preventing risks means legislators shouldn\u2019t take actions where our knowledge of the potential for environmental damage is incomplete or uncertain but there is cause for concern. The burden of proof is on proving lack of harm, not on proving harm. Protecting resources means preserving things like water and soil in a form future generations can use.\n To give another example, some countries evoke versions of the Precautionary Principle to justify bans on genetically modified foods\u2014in some cases for good, in others until evidence of their safety is considered stronger. It is left to legislators to interpret and apply the Precautionary Principle within specific situations.\n The flexibility of the Precautionary Principle is both a source of strength and a source of weakness. We live in a fast-moving world where regulation does not always keep up with innovation, meaning guidelines (as opposed to rules) can often prove useful.\n Another reason the Precautionary Principle can be a practical addition to legislation is that science doesn\u2019t necessarily move fast enough to protect us from potential risks, especially ones that  shift harm elsewhere or take a long time to show up. For example, thousands of human-made substances are present in the food we eat, ranging from medications given to livestock to materials used in packaging. Proving that a new additive has health risks once it\u2019s in the food supply could take decades because it\u2019s incredibly difficult to isolate causative factors. So some regulators, including the Food and Drug Administration in America, require manufacturers to prove something is safe before it goes to market. This approach isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s far safer than waiting to discover harm after we start eating something.\n The Precautionary Principle forces us to ask a lot of difficult questions about the nature of risk, uncertainty, probability, the role of government, and ethics. It can also prompt us to question our intuitions surrounding the right decisions to make in certain situations.\n  When handling risks, it is important to be aware of what we don\u2019t or can\u2019t know for sure. The Precautionary Principle is not intended to be a stifling justification for banning things\u2014it\u2019s a tool for handling particular kinds of uncertainty. Heuristics can guide us in making important decisions, but we still need to be flexible and treat each case as unique.\n So how should we use the Precautionary Principle? Sven Ove Hansson suggests two requirements in   How Extreme Is the Precautionary Principle? First, if there are competing priorities (beyond avoidance of harm), it should be combined with other decision-making principles. For example, the idea of \u201c explore versus exploit\u201d teaches us that we need to balance doubling down on existing options with trying out new ones. Second, the decision to take precautionary action should be based on the most up-to-date science, and there should be plans in place for how to update that decision if the science changes. That includes planning how often to revaluate the evidence and how to assess its quality.\n When is it a good idea to use the Precautionary Principle? There are a few types of situations where it\u2019s better to be safe rather than sorry if things are uncertain.\n When the costs of waiting are low. As we\u2019ve already seen, the Precautionary Principle is intended as a tool for handling uncertainty, rather than a justification for arbitrary bans. This means that if the safety of something is uncertain but the costs of waiting to learn more are low, it\u2019s a good idea to use precaution.\n When preserving optionality is a priority. The Precautionary Principle is most often evoked for potential risks that would cause irreversible, far-reaching, uncontainable harm. Seeing as we don\u2019t know what the future holds, keeping our options open by avoiding limiting choices gives us the most flexibility later on. The Precautionary Principle preserves optionality by ensuring we don\u2019t restrict the resources we have available further down the line or leave messes for our future selves to clean up.\n When the potential costs of a risk are far greater than the cost of preventative action. If a potential risk would be devastating or even ruinous, and it\u2019s possible to protect against it, precautionary action is key. Sometimes winning is just staying in the game\u2014and sometimes staying in the game boils down to not letting anything wipe you out.\n For example, in 1963 the Swiss government pledged to provide bunker spaces to all citizens in the event of a nuclear attack or disaster. The country still maintains a national system of thousands of warning sirens and distributes potassium iodide tablets (used to reduce the effects of radiation) to people living near nuclear plants in case of an accident. Given the potential effects of an incident on Switzerland (regardless of how likely it is), these precautionary actions are considered worthwhile.\n When alternatives are available. If there are alternative courses of action we know to be safe, it\u2019s a good idea to wait for more information before adopting a new risky one.\n  As the third criteria for using the Precautionary Principle usefully, Sven Ove Hansson recommends it not be used when the likelihood or scale of a potential risk is too low for precautionary action to have any benefit. For example, if one person per year dies from an allergic reaction to a guinea pig bite, it\u2019s probably not worth banning pet guinea pigs. We can add a few more examples of situations where it\u2019s generally not a good idea to use the Precautionary Principle.\n When the tradeoffs are substantial and known. The whole point of the Precautionary Principle is to avoid harm. If we know for sure that  not taking an action will cause more damage than taking it possibly could, it\u2019s not a good idea to use precaution.\n For example, following a 2011 accident at Fukushima, Japan shut down all nuclear power plants. Seeing as nuclear power is cheaper than fossil fuels, this resulted in a sharp increase in electricity prices in parts of the country. According to the authors of the paper  Be Cautious with the Precautionary Principle, the resulting increase in mortality from people being unable to spend as much on heating was higher than the fatalities from the actual accident.\n When the risks are known and priced in. We all have different levels of  risk appetite and we make judgments about whether certain activities are worth the risks involved. When a risk is priced in, that means people are aware of it and voluntarily decide it is worthwhile\u2014or even desirable.\n For example, riskier investments tend to have higher potential returns. Although they might not make sense for someone who doesn\u2019t want to risk losing any money, they do make sense for those who consider the potential gains worth the potential losses.\n When only a zero-risk option would be satisfying. It\u2019s impossible to completely avoid risks, so it doesn\u2019t make much sense to exercise precaution with the expectation that a 100% safe option will appear.\n When taking risks could strengthen us. As individuals, we can sometimes be overly risk averse and too cautious\u2014to the point where it makes us fragile. Our ancestors had the best chance of surviving if they overreacted, rather than underreacted, to risks. But for many of us today, the biggest risk we face can be the stress caused by worrying too much about  improbable dangers. We can end up fearing the kinds of risks, like social rejection, that are unavoidable and that tend to make us stronger if we embrace them as inevitable. Never taking any risks is generally a far worse idea than taking sensible ones.\n  We all face decisions every day that involve balancing risk. The Precautionary Principle is a tool that helps us determine when a particular choice is worth taking a gamble on, or when we need to sit tight and collect more information.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:47:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9884\u9632,principle,\u98ce\u9669", "title": "\u9884\u9632\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff1f ", "title_en": "The Precautionary Principle: Better Safe Than Sorry?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://fs.blog/2021/06/precautionary-principle/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9884\u9632", "principle", "\u98ce\u9669"]}]
