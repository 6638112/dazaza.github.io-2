Then, as we all know, Apple jumped horse to the iPhone, which was a vastly bigger business again. But meanwhile, music switched from the download-to-own model pioneered by Apple to subscription streaming, and Apple was very late to streaming. Today it has an adequate, me-too streaming music product, but it’s far from setting the agenda. Apple doesn’t matter much in music anymore.</p><p>曾几何时，苹果是iPod公司。 iPods比Mac更大，而且他们还在音乐行业中制造了苹果的主导力量。然后，众所周知，苹果将马跳到了iPhone上，这是一个非常大的业务。但同时，音乐从Apple开启的下载型模型转换为订阅流，并且苹果对流迟到了。今天它有足够的，我太媒体的音乐产品，但它远未设法。苹果在音乐中并不重要。</p><p> However, the switch to streaming also meant that music lost the strategic leverage that it had for Apple and other device companies - if you switched between stores you lost all the music you’d already bought, but if you switch streaming services you only lose your playlists, if that. Music stopped mattering as a way to lock people into an ecosystem, and it stopped being a strategic lever. Apple could perhaps* have created streaming itself, if it had had the vision, but it had little to gain from it.</p><p> 然而，交换机还意味着音乐丢失了它为苹果和其他设备公司拥有的战略杠杆作用 - 如果您在商店之间切换，您丢失了您已经购买的所有音乐，但如果您切换流服务，您只会丢失播放列表，如果是的话。音乐停止了扭曲人物进入生态系统的一种方式，它停止成为战略杠杆。 Apple可能会*已经创造了流动，如果它有愿景，但它几乎没有从中获得。</p><p> What came after music? When Apple announced the iPhone, back in 2007, it also announced the original Apple TV, earlier in the same event. Google had bought Youtube two months earlier, Hulu launched that summer, and everyone in the TV industry knew that the future, at some point, would be unbundling and streaming. Steve Jobs thought he could do to TV what he had done to music - he could sweep away an arcane, complex, user-hostile experience driven by perverse incentives and misaligned industry structures, and replace it with one seamless simple experience, with Apple, of course, running the whole thing and taking a cut, but not, crucially, having to buy any actual TV shows itself (after all, Apple never had to sign musicians or run a mobile network). That didn’t happen, obviously. The Apple TV never really went anywhere, and today, Apple doesn’t matter much more in TV than it does in music.</p><p> 音乐后来了什么？当Apple宣布iPhone时，返回2007年，它还宣布了原始的Apple TV，同一个活动。谷歌早些时候购买了YouTube，Hulu推出了那个夏天，而电视业的每个人都知道未来，在某些时候，将是解体和流媒体。史蒂夫乔布斯认为他可以通过电视电视电视，他可以扫除由歪曲激励和未对准的行业结构驱动的奥术，复杂，用户敌对的经验，并用一个无缝的简单经验用苹果替换它课程，运行整个事情并削减，但不是，至关重要的是，不得不购买任何实际的电视都显示出来（毕竟，苹果从未签署音乐家或运行移动网络）。显然没有发生。 Apple TV从未真正去过任何地方，今天，苹果在电视上的内容并不多于音乐。</p><p> Of course, no-one else quite managed to do this either. TV has indeed moved to streaming, and Google, Roku and Amazon Fire have managed to take positions as fairly thin smart TV platforms that can extract a certain amount of rent and start building a position in ‘addressable advertising’, but the content that matters is still owned and controlled by content companies - by TV companies. Disney, Netflix and HBO own their shows, their apps and their subscriptions, and Amazon is big in TV because it spends billions of dollars buying TV shows, not because of software.</p><p> 当然，没有人相当成功地做到这一点。电视确实搬到了流式传输，谷歌，俄罗斯州和亚马逊火灾已经设法将职位视为相当薄的智能电视平台，可以提取一定数量的租金并开始在“可寻址广告”中建立一个位置，但重要的内容是重要的仍然拥有和控制内容公司 - 电视公司。迪士尼，Netflix和HBO拥有他们的展示，他们的应用和订阅，亚马逊在电视中很大，因为它花费了数十亿美元的购买电视节目，而不是因为软件。</p><p> We could argue for a long time about why this happened - perhaps it’s because a market with hundreds of shows is different to a market with million of tracks, and perhaps it’s because big media companies had seen what happened to music (and didn’t have the same piracy problem and revenue collapse to force their hand). In a narrow sense, Apple is behind Roku and Fire because it didn’t want to licence an embedded OS into other people’s TV hardware and it didn’t want to sell a $50 Airplay dongle (as I  suggested in 2013, a month before the Chromecast was announced). But the general issue was that the opportunity to do an Apple experience, to do an iTunes (or Spotify!) to the TV market, and to turn TV into a strategic tool for Apple’s broader business, really wasn’t there. In music, Apple built and owned the Suez Canal and taxed everything going through, and then it wanted to build the Panama Canal in TV, but that turned out not to be possible for anyone.</p><p> 我们可以争论很长一段时间了解为什么这发生了 - 也许是因为有数百个节目的市场与百万轨道的市场不同，也许是因为大媒体公司看到了音乐发生了什么（并且没有相同的盗版问题和收入崩溃迫使他们的手）。在一个狭隘的意义上，苹果在roku和火后面，因为它不想向其他人的电视硬件许可嵌入式操作系统，它不想出售50美元的airplay加密狗（正如我在2013年在2013年建议的那样， Chromecast被宣布）。但是，一般问题是，有机会做一个苹果经验，做一个iTunes（或Spotify！）到电视市场，并将电视变成苹果更广泛的业务的战略工具，真的不在那里。在音乐中，Apple建造并拥有苏伊士运河并征税一切都经历，然后它想在电视中建造巴拿马运河，但结果不可能为任何人来说。</p><p> Something else was going on at the same time, though. When Steve Jobs launched the app store in 2008, he said that the commission on payments was only there to cover the running costs, but 12 years later in 2020, Apple’s app store commission revenue was close to $15bn, which was larger than total global revenue from the entire digital music industry, and at much higher margin.</p><p> 虽然，别的事情发生了。当史蒂夫乔布斯于2008年推出了App Store时，他说，付款委员会仅涵盖运营成本，但12年后2020年后，Apple的App Store委员会收入接近15亿美元，比全球总额大整个数字音乐行业的收入，更高的边缘。</p><p>  Around 90% of this revenue comes from games, and almost all of that comes from in-app purchases. Apple, almost accidentally, created a new gaming platform with vastly greater reach than consoles or PCs and a disruptive new revenue model that doubled the size of the global games industry.</p><p>  大约90％的收入来自游戏，几乎所有这些都来自应用内购买。 Apple几乎不小心地创建了一个新的游戏平台，而且比控制台或PC以及全球游戏行业规模翻了一番的中断新的收入模型。 </p><p> This commission revenue is now, of course, under question, as I wrote  here last week. Even if Apple defeats Epic’s lawsuit in the USA, the EU has already decided against it in Spotify’s complaint, and it seems clear that it will no longer be able to enforce its requirement for anyone selling content inside an iOS app to use its payment system and give it a 30% commission. However, it’s less clear how much of that 30% will actually move. A giant company with lots of engagement and a trusted brand (i.e. Epic, or perhaps Tencent, reputedly 10% of Apple’s commissions) can probably persuade people to enter a credit card, but Apple’s system will still have lower friction and higher conversion, and so many apps will still offer it. The real threat might be for a court or the EU to force Apple to allow fintech companies to replace Apple’s in-app payment system itself, or indeed to replace Apple Pay - to allow other companies to offer frictionless payment on the phone instead of Apple. That seems much less likely, though.</p><p>目前，该委员会的收入当然是我上周在这里写的。即使Apple在美国击败EPIC的诉讼，欧盟也已经在Spotify的投诉中决定，似乎很明显，它似乎不再能够为任何销售IOS应用程序内容的人来实施它来使用其付款系统和给它30％的佣金。但是，它不太清楚30％的实际情况。一家巨大的公司，有很多订婚和一个值得信赖的品牌（即史诗或许腾讯，据称10％的苹果委员会）可以说服人们进入信用卡，但苹果的系统仍将具有较低的摩擦力和更高的转换，所以许多应用程序仍然会提供它。真正的威胁可能是一个法院或欧盟强迫苹果允许Fintech公司取代Apple的应用内支付系统本身，或者确实取代Apple Pay  - 允许其他公司在电话上提供无摩擦的付款而不是苹果。但是，这似乎不太可能。</p><p> This isn’t the only way that Apple makes money from its control of the iPhone, nor the only lawsuit. Google paid Apple around $10bn last year to be the default search engine in Safari (which has around 60% of US mobile web traffic**). The US DoJ is suing Google over this, on the grounds that Google is abusing its market dominance in search by outbidding competing search engines that can’t afford to pay this much. But setting aside the fact that Google’s biggest competitor in web search is Microsoft, which is not exactly short of cash itself, one could just as easily say that Apple is using its market power in US smartphone browsers to squeeze $10bn a year out of Google.</p><p> 这不是苹果从Iphone的控制中赚钱的唯一方法，也不是唯一的诉讼。 Google支付苹果在去年左右10亿美元，是Safari中的默认搜索引擎（其中大约60％的美国移动Web流量**）。美国Doj正在为此采取谷歌，因为谷歌正在滥用其市场主导地位，通过占竞争对手的竞争搜索引擎来搜索，这是不起这么多支付的。但是，谷歌在Web搜索中的最大竞争对手是微软的事实，这并不完全缺乏现金本身，这可以很容易地说，Apple在美国智能手机浏览器中使用其市场力量来挤出谷歌的每年10亿美元。</p><p> So, in 2020 Apple had $15bn in revenue from App Store commissions, and another $10bn of pure margin from Google. Netflix’s total revenue in 2020 was… $25bn, and it had to spend $15bn buying TV shows to get that. Maybe missing TV and streaming music turned out OK for Apple.</p><p> 因此，在2020年，App Store委员会的收入有15亿美元，谷歌的另外10亿美元的纯净保证金。 Netflix在2020年的收入是...... 250亿美元，并且必须花费15亿美元购买电视节目以获得这一点。可能缺少电视和流媒体音乐对苹果来说也可以。</p><p>  Apple regards itself not just as a platform provider but as a system provider. Your iPhone is a  system, and Apple decides how it works and what developers can do on it, and just as Apple controls security, wireless networking, power management or multi-tasking, it also controls privacy. This year Apple started requiring apps to get permission before sharing information to track users across different sites (‘ATT’), just as the EU and California’s cookie laws have required the same on the web. The main reason to do this tracking is to make advertising more relevant (and therefore more valuable for publishers), and ATT, cookie laws, and Apple and Google’s decision to block third party cookies on the web anyway, in Safari and Chrome, all mean that the foundation of a lot of online advertising has collided with privacy and shattered, with very little clarity on what comes next.</p><p>  Apple认为本身不仅仅是平台提供商，而是作为系统提供商。您的iPhone是一个系统，Apple决定它如何运作以及开发人员可以做些什么，并且就像Apple控制安全，无线网络，电源管理或多任务一样，它也控制了隐私。今年Apple开始在分享信息之前要求应用程序在不同网站上跟踪用户（'ATT'），就像欧盟和加利福尼亚州的Cookie法则在网上需要相同一样。此跟踪的主要原因是使广告更相关（因此对出版商更有价值），以及ATT，Cookie法律和苹果和谷歌的决定在Web上阻止第三方Cookie，在Safari和Chrome中，所有的意思很多在线广告的基础已经与隐私和破碎的群体相撞，并且对接下来的事情很清楚。</p><p> In parallel, Apple has built up its own ad system on the iPhone, which records, tracks and targets users and serves them ads, but does this on the device itself rather than on the cloud, and only its own apps and services. Apple tracks lots of different aspects of your behaviour and uses that data to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts and serve you ads that are targeted to your interests, in the App Store, Stocks and News apps. You can read Apple’s description of that  here - Apple is tracking  a lot of user data, but nothing leaves your phone. Your  phone is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything.</p><p> 并行，Apple已在iPhone上建立了自己的广告系统，它记录，追踪和针对用户并为它们提供广告，但在设备本身而不是在云上执行此操作，并且只有其自己的应用程序和服务。 Apple跟踪您的行为的许多不同方面，并使用该数据将您放入匿名的基于兴趣的群组，并为您的兴趣提供的广告，在App Store，Stock和News应用程序中。您可以阅读Apple对这里的描述 -  Apple正在跟踪大量的用户数据，但没有任何留下手机。你的手机正在跟踪你，但它没有告诉任何人。</p><p> This is conceptually pretty similar to Google’s proposed  FLoC, in which your Chrome web browser uses the web pages you visit to put you into anonymised interest-based cohorts without your browsing history itself leaving your device. Publishers (and hence advertisers) can ask Chrome for a cohort and serve you an appropriate ad rather than tracking and targeting you yourself. Your  browser is tracking you, but it doesn’t tell anyone anything -except for that anonymous cohort.</p><p> 这与Google的提议的Floc概念性相似，您的Chrome Web浏览器使用您访问的网页来将您进入匿名的兴趣的群组，而无需您的浏览历史悠久地离开您的设备。出版商（以及广告商）可以向群组询问Chrome，为您提供适当的广告，而不是跟踪和针对您。您的浏览器正在跟踪您，但它不会告诉任何人 - 匿名队列的except。</p><p> Google, obviously, wants FLoC to be a generalised system used by third-party publishers and advertisers. At the moment, Apple runs its own cohort tracking, publishing and advertising as a sealed system. It has begun selling  targeted ads inside the App Store (at precisely the moment that it crippled third party app install ads with IDFA), but it isn’t offering this tracking and targeting to anyone else. Unlike FLoC, an advertiser, web page or app can’t ask what cohort your iPhone has put you in - only Apple’s apps can do that, including the app store.</p><p> 显然，谷歌希望Floc成为第三方出版商和广告商使用的广义系统。目前，Apple将自己的队列跟踪，发布和广告作为密封系统运行。它已开始在App Store内销售目标广告（恰恰在其瘫痪的第三方应用程序安装ADS与IDFA的那一刻），但它并没有提供此跟踪并针对其他任何人。与Floc，广告商，网页或应用程序不可能询问您的iPhone是否已进入哪些副手，仅包含Apple的应用程序，包括App Store。 </p><p> So, the obvious, cynical theory is that Apple decided to cripple third-party app install ads just at the point that it was poised to launch its own, and to weaken the broader smartphone ad model so that companies would be driven towards in-app purchase instead. (The even more cynical theory would be that Apple expects to lose a big chunk of App Store commission as a result of lawsuits and so plans to replace this with app install ads. I don’t actually believe this - amongst other things I think Apple believes it will win its Epic and Spotify cases.)</p><p>因此，显而易见的愤世嫉俗的理论是苹果决定将第三方应用程序安装广告，即在它准备启动自己的观点，并削弱更广泛的智能手机广告模型，以便公司将推向应用程序代替购买。 （更为愤世嫉俗的理论是苹果公司希望由于诉讼而失去一个大块的App Store委员会，因此计划用App安装广告替换它。我实际上并不相信这一点 - 在其他事情中，我认为苹果相信它将赢得其史诗和发现案件。）</p><p> Much more interesting, though, is what happens if Apple opens up its cohort tracking and targeting, and says that apps, or Safari, can now serve anonymous, targeted,  private ads without the publisher or developer knowing the targeting data. It could create an API to serve those ads in Safari and in apps, without the publisher knowing what the cohort was or even without knowing what the ad was. What if Apple offered that, and described it as a truly ‘private, personalised’ ad model, on a platform with at least 60% of US mobile traffic, and over a billion global users?</p><p> 但是，如果Apple开辟了队列跟踪和定位，则会更有趣，并且说，Apps或Safari现在可以为没有发布者或开发人员了解定位数据的匿名，有针对性的私人广告。它可以创建一个API，用于在Safari和Apps中为那些广告提供服务，而没有出版商知道队列甚至不知道广告是什么。如果Apple提供的，并将其描述为真正的“私人，个性化的”广告模型，在一个拥有至少60％的美国移动流量的平台上，超过10亿美元？</p><p> Apple’s approach to privacy has been a topic for quite a while now. Five or six years ago, when it became clear how important machine learning would be, a lot of people  wondered if Apple’s increasingly vocal advocacy for privacy could be a strategic liability. ML was the future and ML was data, but Apple was talking a lot about not collecting data. It turned out that Apple was able to collect all the data it wanted, in ways that it could claim were still private, and perhaps just as importantly it was also able to persuade  machine learning people to find a home inside Apple’s culture. Conversely, privacy has become more and more of a strategic asset, both in the abstract as a marketing tool but much more tangibly as Apple built things like payment, credit cards, smart speakers, watches, biometric sensors and now, probably, AR glasses (which, amongst other things, are a wearable camera and microphone). This also reflects a broader theme - Apple has a tendency to build up strategic assets in discrete blocks and small parts of products, and then combine them into one. It’s been planning to shift the Mac to its own silicon for close to a decade, and added biometrics to its products before adding Apple Pay and then a credit card. Now it has Apple Pay and ‘Sign in with Apple’ as new building blocks on the web, that might be combined into other things. It seems pretty obvious that Privacy is another of those building blocks, deployed step by step in lots of different places. Privacy has been good business for Apple, and advertising is a bigger business than all of those.</p><p> Apple对隐私的方法已经是一个很长一段时间的话题。五六年前，当它明确了机器学习的重要性，很多人想知道苹果越来越多的隐私声乐倡导是否可能是一种战略责任。 ML是未来，ML是数据，但苹果正在谈论不收集数据。事实证明，Apple能够收集它所希望的所有数据，以其可能索赔仍然是私人，也许同样重要的是，它也能够说服机器学习人们在苹果文化中找到一个家。相反，隐私已经成为越来越多的战略资产，都是摘要作为营销工具，但随着Apple建造的，如苹果建造了如付款，信用卡，智能扬声器，手表，生物识别传感器，现在，可能是AR眼镜（其中，在其他方面，是可穿戴的相机和麦克风）。这也反映了一个更广泛的主题 - 苹果可以在离散块和小部分产品中建立战略资产的趋势，然后将它们结合成一个。正计划将MAC转移到自己的硅，以接近十年，并在添加Apple Pay然后是信用卡之前向其产品添加生物识别。现在它有Apple支付和“Apple”作为网络上的新构建块，可能会将其组合在其他方面。它似乎很明显，隐私是那些构建块的另一个块，在很多不同的地方逐步部署。隐私为Apple良好的业务，广告是比所有人更大的​​业务。</p><p> So, Steve Jobs changed music by sweeping away an arcane, complex, user-hostile experience driven by perverse incentives and misaligned industry structures. That also describes mobile apps before the iPhone. Does it describe online advertising? Well, yes - obviously.</p><p> 因此，史蒂夫乔布斯通过扫除经过反常激励和未对准的行业结构驱动的奥术，复杂，用户敌对经验来改变了音乐。这也描述了iPhone之前的移动应用程序。它描述了在线广告吗？好吧，是的 - 显然。</p><p>  The ad market is a mess, and now very unstable, and poised, perhaps, to move to a very different idea of what ‘privacy’ means and how it works. Apple has both the market power and the brand to launch a new privacy-based tracking and targeting ad model, and offer it on hundreds of millions of high-spending users’ devices.</p><p>  广告市场是一团糟，现在非常不稳定，也许大观，也许是对“隐私”手段的思想非常不同，以及它是如何工作的。 Apple拥有市场力量和品牌，推出基于新的基于隐私的跟踪和定位广告模型，并提供数亿种高消费用户的设备。</p><p> On the other hand, this may be a case of what my old colleague Steven Sinofsky likes to call the ‘Dr Evil’ theory of company strategy. The press used to see five or ten things going on in different parts of Microsoft, imagine they were all linked together, and say “Aha! We have worked out their evil brilliant plan for world domination!” - and people at Microsoft would read the story and say “That’s a good idea! We should do that! - except we could never make it work.”</p><p> 另一方面，这可能是我的老同事史蒂文Sinofsky喜欢称之为“邪恶博士”的公司战略理论的情况。媒体用来看到微软不同地区的五个或十件事，想象一下他们都在一起，并说“啊！我们已经为世界统治造成了邪恶的辉煌计划！“ - 微软的人们会读这个故事并说“这是一个好主意！我们应该这样做！ - 除了我们永远无法使它工作。“</p><p> Why might Apple be unable to make this work? Well, it first got into mobile ads in 2010 when it bought  Quattro Wireless for close to $300m and set up  iAd. (It bought PA Semi two years earlier, for almost the same price. That worked out OK.) But Apple never really understood what to do with it, nor how the ad business worked, and wasn’t able to be a great partner for publishers and advertisers.  iAd shut down in 2016. A decade on, Apple still has many of the same issues partnering,  as also seen at Apple News. Building an ad-tech business is not just about tech: Google and Facebook have vast campuses in Silicon Valley full of engineers, but also have whole city blocks in Manhattan full of advertising people, talking to advertisers and ad agencies. Apple also has a systemic cultural and operational bias against rapid iteration and shipping of any kind of software, but especially cloud services. You can’t launch an ad platform in iOS 15 next month and then wait a year to add new stuff in iOS 16. And even more, Apple has always been ambivalent about the web itself - that might be the biggest cultural shift of all.</p><p> 为什么Apple可能无法做出这项工作？好吧，它首先在2010年进入了移动广告，当时它购买了Quattro无线，接近300米，并设置IAD。 （它早先购买Pa半，出于几乎相同的价格。这效果好了。）但是苹果从未真正了解该做什么，也不是广告业务如何工作，并且无法成为一个伟大的合作伙伴出版商和广告商。 IAD在2016年关闭。十年，苹果仍然有许多同样的问题合作，也可以在苹果新闻中看到。建立一个广告科技企业不仅仅是关于技术：谷歌和Facebook在硅谷拥有丰富的校园，都装满了工程师，而且还有曼哈顿的整个城市街区充满了广告人，与广告商和广告机构谈话。 Apple还具有系统的文化和运营偏见，免受任何类型的软件的快速迭代和运输，但尤其是云服务。您无法在下个月内推出IOS 15的广告平台，然后等待一年以在iOS 16中添加新的东西。甚至更多，Apple一直是关于网络本身的矛盾 - 这可能是所有的最大的文化转变。 </p><p>  There’s an old line that everyone in tech is trying to give someone else’s business away for free, and to turn it into a feature of their own product and their own business model. Google gives away a free smartphone operating system to support its ad business, and Amazon gives away free TV shows to support its ecommerce business. Apple’s business model is to sell hardware to around a billion people, bringing in about $200 per user at a 30% gross margin in 2020, then to give away, or sell, a lot of other services on top, both for incremental revenue (about $50 per user at 65% gross margin) and to drive retention.</p><p>有一种旧线路，科技的每个人都试图免费向别人的业务提供免费，并将其转化为自己的产品和自己的商业模式。谷歌赠送免费的智能手机操作系统来支持其广告业务，亚马逊赠送免费电视节目，以支持其电子商务业务。 Apple的商业模式是将硬件销售到大约十亿人，每名用户在2020年的30％毛利率下达到约200美元，然后放弃或卖出大量其他服务，无论是增量收入每个用户50美元，毛利率为65％），并延续保留。</p><p> What kind of services? Well, Apple looks for businesses it can transform with simplicity and control, and take a cut, without owning anything itself, and where it can use that to leverage hardware sales. That worked for music, failed for TV, succeeded massively in smartphone apps and especially games, and has done OK in payments. How about advertising?</p><p> 什么样的服务？嗯，Apple寻找企业它可以用简单和控制来改造，并在没有拥有任何东西的情况下削减，并且它可以使用它来利用硬件销售。为音乐工作失败，电视失败，在智能手机应用程序和尤其是游戏中成功地成功，并在付款中完成了确定。广告怎么样？</p><p>   * Arguable, the record companies only allowed streaming music to begin with because Sweden and Spotify were too small to look like a threat, and because Spotify gave them equity.</p><p>   *可以说，唱片公司只允许流媒体音乐开始，因为瑞典和Spotify太小而无法看起来像威胁，因为Spotify给了他们股权。</p><p> ** You can install Chrome on iOS, but it has tiny share. The Chrome team would argue this is because Apple doesn’t let iOS browsers use their own rendering engines (they have to use Apple’s Webkit). I suspect the fact it’s good enough and the default is more important. There may be another court case coming here.</p><p> **您可以在iOS上安装Chrome，但它具有微小的份额。 Chrome团队将争辩，这是因为Apple不会让i​​OS浏览器使用自己的渲染引擎（他们必须使用Apple的WebKit）。我怀疑这是足够好的事实，默认更为重要。这里可能有另一个法院案件。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music">https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/5/13/apples-ads-music</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/更改/">#更改</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/change/">#change</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
