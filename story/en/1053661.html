Then, he took another, even longer walk. And then another one. And then another. Soon, he had given away almost all of his money and taken to walking almost year-round, roaming the post-industrial wilderness of North America in what he called “a desperate search for peace”.</p><p>    我在这个地球上的第61岁了，那个叫做自己的人nimblewill游牧场离开了家，走过山脉很长的路 - 约1000万步，他估计，或4,400英里。然后，他接受了另一个，甚至更长的步行。然后另一个。然后是另一个。很快，他几乎所有的钱都抛弃了几乎一直走向走，漫游北美的产业后荒野，他所谓的“绝望地寻求和平”。</p><p> His fellow long-distance hikers speak of him in mythical terms. They told me that, in order to avoid foot infections, he had chosen to have all 10 of his toenails surgically removed. He was said to never carry more than 10lbs on his back, and to have invented a tiny stove that ran on twigs and grass, so he wouldn’t have to carry fuel.</p><p> 他的同胞长距离的徒步旅行者在神话中谈到他。他们告诉我，为了避免脚部感染，他选择手术删除了所有10个他的脚趾甲。他据说从未在他的背上携带超过10磅，并在树枝和草地上发明了一块小炉子，所以他不必携带燃料。</p><p>   Over 15 years, he had hiked 34,000 miles. First he completed the so-called Triple Crown of long-distance trails: the Appalachian trail (2,200 miles), the Pacific Crest trail (2,650 miles), and the Continental Divide trail (3,100 miles). Then he went on to complete all 11 national scenic trails in 2013. Triumphant, fulfilled, and nearing his 75th birthday, he vowed to hang up his hiking boots.</p><p>   15年来，他徒步旅行了34,000英里。首先，他完成了所谓的长距离小径三重冠：阿巴拉契亚径（2,200英里），太平洋嵴径（2,650英里）和大陆鸿沟（3100英里）。然后他继续在2013年完成所有11条国家风景赛道。胜利，满足，靠近他的75岁生日，他发誓要挂断他的徒步旅行。</p><p> Then, the next spring, he was back. He announced he would complete a grueling road-walk from New Mexico to Florida, in order to complete a route he had named the Great American Loop, which connected the four farthest corners of the continental US. This, he claimed, would be his last long hike.</p><p> 然后，下一个春天，他回来了。他宣布，他将从新墨西哥州到佛罗里达队完成一个艰苦的道路，以完成他被评为伟大的美国循环的路线，这与美国大陆的四个最远的角落联系起来。他声称，这将是他最后的徒步旅行。</p><p> I wrote to him to ask if I could join him for a few days. After some delicate negotiation – he harbored a deep if not altogether ill-founded suspicion of journalists – he agreed to let me walk with him. He told me that he would be hiking east on highway TX-73 somewhere outside of Winnie, Texas, on a certain day in early June. If I could find him, I was welcome to tag along. But he wasn’t slowing down for anybody.</p><p> 我写信给他，问我是否可以加入他几天。经过一些微妙的谈判 - 如果没有完全没有对记者的怀疑，他都会受到深刻的恐惧 - 他同意让我和他一起走路。他告诉我，他在德克萨斯州德克萨斯州温妮以外的地方徒步旅行，他将在德克萨斯州的德克萨斯州的某个地方徒步旅行。如果我能找到他，我很欢迎我来努力。但他对任何人都没有放缓。</p><p>  On the appointed day, my sister and I drove south-east from Houston, eyes peeled for a walker by the side of the road. As we passed a place on the map called Alligator Hole Marsh, we spotted him: a white apparition on the far side of the highway, walking upstream against the traffic.</p><p>  在指定的一天，我的妹妹和我从休斯顿开车到东南，眼睛在路边剥落了一辆助行器。当我们在地图上传递了一个名叫鳄鱼洞沼泽的地方，我们发现了他：在高速公路的远侧是一个白色的幻影，走上了交通的上游。 </p><p> We circled around and parked on the shoulder about 50 yards up the road. He waved as he drew near. He carried a blue backpack no larger than a preschooler’s knapsack. A single plastic water bottle was tied to his belt with a piece of frayed blue string. His trekking poles were folded in the crook of his arm. In his hand, he carried a chipped styrofoam coffee cup.</p><p>我们在肩膀上旋转并停在肩膀上约50码。当他画附近时，他挥手了。他带着一个蓝色背包，不大于学龄前儿童背包。单个塑料水瓶用一块磨损的蓝色绳子绑在腰带上。他的徒步杆折叠在他的手臂的弯曲中。在他的手中，他带着一个碎蛋白酶咖啡杯。</p><p> When he reached the car, I shook his hand, and he smiled. He had a wild head of white hair streaked with yellow, and a white beard threaded with black. He took his sunglasses off, and his eyes, arced against the sun, were fixed with deep, leathered creases, pale in their depths. His hands too were deeply tanned, but only up to around the base of his thumb; the rest of each hand, shaded by the his cuffs of his shirt, was pink.</p><p> 当他到达车时，我握着他的手，他笑了笑。他有一个狂放的白色头发，用黄色划线，白色的胡须螺纹划着黑色。他脱掉了他的太阳镜，他的眼睛被瞄准了阳光，被深深的皱纹固定，深处苍白。他的手也被深深地晒黑了，但只能在拇指的基地周围;每只手的其余部分，被他衬衫的袖口遮蔽，是粉红色的。</p><p> His real name was MJ Eberhart. He said I could call him “Eb”.</p><p> 他的真名是MJ Eberhart。他说我可以称他为“eb”。</p><p> “Welcome to my backyard,” Eberhart said, waving at the vastness with his cup of ice. The land was flat (elevation: 11ft), but the clouds above it were colossal – a white mountain range, severed and levitated.</p><p> “欢迎来到我的后院，”Eberhart说，挥舞着巨大的冰。该土地持平（海拔：11英尺），但云层庞大 - 白山脉，切断和悬浮。</p><p> As we walked, Eberhart recounted his travels thus far. He had begun 46 days earlier at the southern terminus of the Continental Divide trail. From there, he headed east, through the blackened badlands of New Mexico, through the gateway city of El Paso, and on to an endless spread of dry dun plains. The traffic consisted almost entirely of semi-trailer trucks surging past every 10 seconds at speeds of a 100 miles per hour. He had learned to take shallow breaths through his nose, so as to not inhale their fumes. The sound was meteoric.</p><p> 我们走路时，Eberhart迄今为止讲述了他的旅行。他在大陆鸿沟的南部北端前46天开始了。从那里，他通过新墨西哥州的黑暗的荒地，穿过埃尔帕索的黑人荒地，并进入干涸的邓平原的无尽传播。该流量几乎完全由半拖车卡车在每小时100英里的速度下每10秒飙升。他学会了浅呼吸鼻子，以免吸气烟雾。声音很陨石。</p><p> In west Texas, the highway stretched in a straight line to a vanishing point on the horizon. Space and time started to play tricks on him. He walked for hours each day and never seemed to progress, the distant mountains retreating faster than he could catch them. The highway was lined with mileage markers, and he checked each one to convince himself that the numbers were changing.</p><p> 在西德克萨斯州，高速公路以直线伸展到地平线上的消失点。空间和时间开始在他身上扮演技巧。他每天都走了几个小时，似乎从未如此进步，遥远的山脉降低了比他能抓住它们的速度更快。高速公路衬有里程碑，他检查了每个人来说服这些数字正在发生变化。</p><p> His plan was to walk from gas station to gas station, but buildings of any kind were sometimes dozens of miles apart. If people hadn’t stopped to give him water, he may well have died. When he emerged from the desert, vultures were circling ominously over his head.</p><p> 他的计划是从加油站到加油站的行走，但是任何类型的建筑物都有有时相隔几英里。如果人们没有停下来给他水，他可能已经死了。当他从沙漠中出现时，秃鹫在他的脑海中却很难圈出来。 </p><p> Other than the vultures, almost all of the wildlife he had seen was dead (most of it roadkill), including a crushed coral snake, two mule deer, a raccoon, an armadillo, numerous birds, and a group of dead coyotes wired, inexplicably, to a fence.</p><p>除了秃鹰之外，他所看到的几乎所有的野生动物都死了（大部分IT路基），包括一个碎珊瑚蛇，两个骡鹿，浣熊，犰狳，众多鸟类和一群死土狼，莫名其妙地有线，围栏。</p><p>  Step by step, I learned the full story of how this man became Nimblewill Nomad.</p><p>  一步一步，我了解了这个人如何成为nimblewill游牧民族的完整故事。</p><p> He was born Meredith Eberhart – which, he stressed, back then was “a  boy’s name” – in a “sleepy” town in the Ozarks with a population of 336. He likened his childhood to that of Huck Finn: he spent his summers running barefoot, fishing, and riding horses. In the fall, he hunted quail with his father, a country doctor.</p><p> 他出生了Meredith Eberhart  - 他强调，然后回来是“一个男孩的名字” - 在欧洲人口的“困倦”的镇上有336人的人口。他比较童年到哈克·芬恩的那个：他花了他的夏天运行赤脚，钓鱼和骑马。在秋天，他和他的父亲一起追捕鹌鹑，是一个国家医生。</p><p> Eberhart later attended optometry school, got married, and helped raise two boys of his own. They lived in Titusville, Florida (“Space City, USA”), where he was soon making a six-figure salary performing pre-and post-operative work on cataract patients, many of them Nasa scientists. He enjoyed helping people restore their sight and he prided himself on being able to provide for his family, but his work still felt oddly hollow.</p><p> Eberhart后来参加了验光学校，结婚了，并帮助抚养了自己的两个男孩。他们住在佛罗里达州的Titusville（“太空城，美国”），在那里他很快就在白内障患者上表演了六人工薪水，其中许多美国宇航局科学家。他喜欢帮助人们恢复他们的视线，他为能够为他的家人提供骄傲，但他的工作仍然感到奇怪的空洞。</p><p> He retired in 1993 and began spending more time living alone on a plot of land he was developing beside Nimblewill creek in Georgia. He and his wife started to drift apart. There followed a dark period of about five years, about which he said he didn’t remember much. When I later called up his sons – neither of whom had spoken with him in years – they recalled him as a caring father and a dutiful provider, but also someone who was easily frustrated, prone to bouts of drunken brooding, and, occasionally, loud (but never violent) outbursts of rage.</p><p> 他于1993年退休，开始花更多的时间独自生活在乔治亚州尼蒙尔威尔溪旁的土地上。他和他的妻子开始漂移。遵循大约五年的黑暗时期，他说他不记得了。当我后来打电话给他的儿子时 - 既不是谁多年来和他说话 - 他们回忆起他作为一个关怀的父亲和一位忠诚的提供者，也是一个容易沮丧的人，容易出于醉酒的沉思，而且偶尔，响亮的人（但从未暴力）爆发的愤怒。</p><p> His new house sat near the base of Springer Mountain, which he would regularly climb. His hikes gradually grew longer; he began systematically hiking the Appalachian trail section by section, eventually reaching as far as Pennsylvania. Then, in 1998, at the age of 60, he decided to set out on his first “odyssey”, a 4,400 walk from Florida to Cap Gaspé in Quebec, along a sketchy agglomeration of trails, roads, and a few pathless wilderness areas.</p><p> 他的新房子坐在斯普林斯山的基地附近，他会定期攀爬。他的徒步旅行逐渐增长了;他开始系统地将阿巴拉契亚小径部分纳米，最终达到宾夕法尼亚州。然后，1998年，在60岁时，他决定在他的第一个“Odyssey”，从佛罗里达州的第一个“Odyssey”，距离魁北克省的佛罗里达州帕斯佩斯（Quebec）沿着小径，道路和一些无权荒野地区的粗略集聚。</p><p> Not long before, he had been diagnosed with a heart block, but he declined the doctor’s admonitions to have a pacemaker installed. His sons assumed he would not make it home alive.</p><p> 不久以前，他被诊断出患有一块心脏障碍，但他拒绝了医生的劝告安装了起搏器。他的儿子认为他不会让它活着。 </p><p> On the trail, Eberhart renamed himself after his adopted home, Nimblewill creek. He began in the swamps of Florida and hiked north on flooded trails, where the dark, reptilian waters sometimes reached to his waist. When he emerged from the swamps, all 10 of his toenails fell off. By the time he reached Quebec, it was already late October.</p><p>在小径上，埃伯哈特在他收养的家之后更名为自己，Nimblewill Creek。他开始在佛罗里达州的沼泽地，并在洪水淹没的落地上徒步旅行，在那里，黑暗的爬行动物水域有时会达到腰部。当他从沼泽中出现时，他的所有10个脚趾甲都脱落了。当他到达魁北克省时，它已经在10月下旬。</p><p> Over the past nine months, he had experienced a slow religious awakening, but his faith was shaken as he passed through those grim, freezing mountains. “Dear Lord, why have you forsaken me?” he asked, upon seeing the weather darken one day at the base of Mont Jacques Cartier. However, a lucky break in the storm allowed him to reach the snowy mountaintop, where he sat in the sun, feeling “the warm presence of a forgiving God”. After reaching the trail’s end, he returned to the south (on the back of a friend’s motorcycle) and, in a blissful denouement, walked another 178 miles from a town near Miami down to the Florida Keys, where he settled into “a mood of total and absolute, perfect contentment, most near nirvana”.</p><p> 在过去的九个月里，他经历了一个缓慢的宗教觉醒，但他的信仰被震动，因为他通过那些严峻的冰山。 “亲爱的领主，为什么你要迷惑我？”他问道，在蒙特·雅克卡尔亚的基地看到天气变暗时。然而，风暴中的幸运休息允许他到达雪地山顶，在那里他坐在阳光下，感觉“宽恕上帝的温暖存在”。到达小径结束后，他回到了南方（在朋友的摩托车的背面），并且在一个幸福的结局中，距离迈阿密附近的小镇走到佛罗里达群岛的一个城镇，在那里他定居了“情绪总和绝对，完美的满足，最近的Nirvana附近“。</p><p>  He returned home a different man. He stopped showering. He kept his hair long. He began ruthlessly shedding his possessions; over the course of three days, he burned most of the books he had collected over his lifetime, one by one, in a barrel in his front yard.</p><p>  他回到了一个不同的男人。他停止淋浴。他保持着他的头发。他开始无情地脱落他的财产;在三天的过程中，他烧掉了他一生中的大部分书，一个逐个，在他的前院的一桶。</p><p> In 2003, he and his wife divorced. He ceded the house and most of his assets to his ex-wife, and signed over his other real estate holdings, including the land at Nimblewill creek, to his two sons in an irrevocable trust. Since then, he has lived solely off his social security checks. If those funds ran out by the end of the month, he went hungry. But what he had gained was the freedom to walk full time, which felt to him like freedom itself. “As if with each step,” he wrote, “these burdens were slowly but surely being drained from my body, down to the treadway beneath my feet and onto the path behind me.”</p><p> 2003年，他和他的妻子离婚了。他将房子和大部分资产占据了他的前妻，并签署了他的其他房地产控股，包括尼蒙布尔克里克的土地，在不可撤销信任的两个儿子。从那时起，他完全脱离了他的社会保障检查。如果这些资金在月底跑出，他饿了。但是他所获得的自由是自由的自由，这对他来说感觉到自由。 “仿佛每一步，”他写道，“这些负担慢慢但肯定会从我的身体中排出，到我脚下的脚踏船上，然后走到我身后的道路上。”</p><p> Three days I walked with Eberhart, through swampland and farmland and urban wasteland. To pass the hours, we talked; sometimes we argued. I discovered he held a fierce belief in an almighty God, and could not bring himself to believe in the science of Darwinian evolution or anthropogenic climate change. He also held a dogged belief in personal freedom, including the freedom to pollute the atmosphere with fossil fuels. “If I want to buy an airplane and fill it full of a thousand gallons of fifty-dollar-a-gallon fuel, and I got the money to do it, goddamn it, leave me alone!” he exclaimed at one point, in exasperation.</p><p> 三天我与eberhart一起走，通过沼泽地和农田和城市荒地。通过时间，我们谈了;有时我们争辩说。我发现他对一个全能的上帝抱着激烈的信念，无法让自己相信达尔文进化或人为气候变化的科学。他还对个人自由造成了顽强的信念，包括用化石燃料污染大气的自由。 “如果我想买一架飞机并充满一千加仑的五十美元 - 一加仑的燃料，我就可以了这件事，而不是这样做的，让我一个人！”他在一个角度惊呼，恼怒。</p><p> We walked through the very land this philosophy had wrought. We drank tap water that stank of kerosene. We breathed car exhaust. We dined on frozen burritos and fried things from gas stations and diners. (Sometimes we ate the leftover food from neighboring tables.) One night we slept in a grassy ditch in the town of Port Arthur, beside an oil refinery; I strung up my hammock between an electrical pole and a chain link fence bearing a sign that read: “Warning: light hydrocarbon pipeline.”</p><p> 我们走过这哲学锻炼的土地。我们喝了匙子的水龙头。我们呼吸汽车排气。我们在冰冻的墨西哥卷饼和燃气站和食客的油炸东西上。 （有时我们从邻近的桌子上吃了剩余的食物。）一天晚上我们睡在港口亚瑟镇的一条草地上，除了炼油厂;我串起了我的吊床，在电杆和带有符号的链节栅栏之间滚动：“警告：轻质碳氢化合物管道。”</p><p> The next night, we slept in a copse of gnarled oaks beside a graveyard, a shady grove carpeted with slender, rippling leaves. It was strangely lovely. Eberhart found them everywhere, these forgotten little shards of wilderness. The problem, he said, was that hikers tended to divide their lives into compartments: wilderness over here, civilization over there. “The walls that exist between each of these compartments are not there naturally,” he said. “We create them. The guy that has to stand there and look at Mount Olympus to find peace and quiet and solitude and meaning – life has escaped him totally!”’</p><p> 第二天晚上，我们睡在墓地旁边的粗糙的橡树泥，一个阴凉的树丛用细长，涟漪的叶子。它奇怪可爱。 eberhart在任何地方发现它们，这些忘记了小荒野的荒野。他说，问题是，徒步旅行者倾向于将生活归入舱室：荒野在这里，文明在那里。 “这些隔间之间存在的墙壁自然不存在，”他说。 “我们创造了它们。那个人必须站在那里，看着奥林巴斯山寻找和平与安静，孤独和意义 - 生活完全逃脱了他！“ </p><p> Eberhart’s posture was hunched, and he had a slight hitch in his right step, but his stride, from the outset, was remarkably steady: three miles an hour, on the tick.</p><p>Eberhart的姿势驼背，他在正确的步骤中有一个轻微的搭便车，但他的步幅从一开始就非常稳定：三英里，在蜱虫上。</p><p> Throughout the day, to ease his pains, he swallowed handfuls of aspirin and joint supplements. Each year, Eberhart’s hikes got a little shorter, and the winters he spent living out of his pickup truck – camped in Walmart parking lots and national parks – grew longer. At his age, after all he had experienced, it amazed me that he could hike at all.</p><p> 全天，为了缓解他的痛苦，他吞下了少数阿司匹林和联合补充剂。每年，Eberhart的徒步旅行有点缩短，而他花在他的皮卡车上的冬天营地 - 在沃尔玛停车场和国家公园营地 - 长大。在他的年龄，毕竟他经历过，它让我惊讶地让我能够徒步旅行。</p><p> On his journeys, he had broken four ribs, his shinbone, and his ankle. He had suffered from excruciating bouts with shingles and an abscessed tooth. He had visited unspeakable horrors upon his feet. Once, up in  Canada, he had been struck by lightning.</p><p> 在他的旅程中，他已经打破了四个肋骨，他的shinbone和他的脚踝。他遭受了带有瓦片和脓肿的牙齿的休息。他脚下了无法形容的恐怖。曾经，在加拿大，他被闪电击中了。</p><p> At one point on our final day together, Eberhart paused at the intersection of a gravel road to show me the contents of his pack. He spread out his things in the dust. There was a tarp tent, a sleeping bag, a sleeping pad, the small bag of electronics, a hint of a medical kit, a plastic poncho, his maps, a pair of ultralight wind pants, and the pile of metal junk. All of the fabrics had the wispiness of gossamer; a strong wind could had taken most of his earthly possessions away.</p><p> 在我们最后一天的一点一点，eberhart在砾石路上停了暂停，向我展示他的包装的内容。他在尘土中传出了他的东西。有一个篷布帐篷，睡袋，睡垫，小袋电子产品，一丝医疗套件，塑料雨披，他的地图，一对超轻风裤，以及金属垃圾堆。所有的面料都有Gossamer的智慧;强风可能会让他大部分地尘层都带走。</p><p> Besides his truck and a few mementos he kept at his sister’s house, he didn’t own much more than this.</p><p> 除了他的卡车和一些纪念品，他留在他姐姐的房子里，他并没有多得多。</p><p> “I tell my friends: every year I’ve got less and less, and every year I’m a happier man. I just wonder what it’s going to be like when I don’t have anything. That’s the way we come, and that’s the way we go. I’m just preparing for that a little in advance, I guess.”</p><p> “我告诉我的朋友：每年我都越来越少，而且每年我都是一个幸福的人。我只是想知道当我没有任何东西时会发生这种情况。这就是我们来的方式，这就是我们走的方式。我猜，我只是提前一点准备这一点。“</p><p> Instead of a toothbrush, he carried a wooden toothpick. He did not carry a stove. He did not carry a spare change of socks, a spare set of shoes, nor any other spare clothes. He did not carry reading material, nor even a notebook. He did not carry toilet paper. His med-kit contained little more than a few bandaids, a pile of aspirin, and a sliver of a surgical blade.</p><p> 他携带木质牙签而不是牙刷。他没有携带炉子。他没有携带袜子的备用变化，备用鞋子，也不是任何其他备用衣服。他没有携带阅读材料，也没有笔记本。他没有携带卫生纸。他的Med-kit含有少数绑架，一堆阿司匹林，以及一个手术刀片的条子。 </p><p> Shaving down one’s pack weight, he said, was a process of sloughing off one’s fears.</p><p>他说，剃了一个人的包装重量是脱离一个人的恐惧的过程。</p><p> Each object a person carries represents a particular fear: of injury, of discomfort, of boredom, of attack. The “last vestige” of fear that even the most minimalist hikers have trouble shedding, he said, was starvation. As a result, most people ended up carrying “way the hell too much food”. He did not even carry so much as an emergency candy bar.</p><p> 一个人携带的每个对象代表特定的恐惧：患有袭击的无聊的伤害，不适。他说，即使是最少的徒步旅行者甚至是最小的徒步旅行者也有困难的“最后遗迹”是饥饿的。结果，大多数人最终携带“地狱太多的食物”。他甚至没有作为紧急糖果酒吧那么多。</p><p> Earlier, I had asked him if he was afraid to die. He shook his head. “Nah, I don’t think so,” he said. He told me his grandfather had died in the woods (of a heart attack while hunting), his father had died in the woods (of a chainsaw accident while gathering firewood), and he was “working on it”.</p><p> 早些时候，我问他是否害怕死。他摇了摇头。 “不，我不这么认为，”他说。他告诉我，他的祖父在树林里去世了（狩猎时心脏病发作），他的父亲在树林里去世（在收集木柴时的电锯事故），他“致力于它”。</p><p> As I picked over his gear, one question kept nagging at me. Feeling sheepish, I asked if the rumor I’d heard was true: did he have all of his toenails surgically removed?</p><p> 当我挑着他的装备时，一个问题一直唠叨我。感到羞怯，我问了我听到的谣言是真的：他手术删除了他的所有脚趾甲吗？</p><p>   He sat down and pulled off his tattered sneakers, and then peeled off his socks. His ankles were a shocked shade of pale below the sockline. His pink toes, rimmed with yellow calluses, were long and knobby. When I looked closer, I saw that it was true: they had no nails, except for a few whiskery fibers that were trying to grow back.</p><p>   他坐下来脱掉他破碎的运动鞋，然后脱掉袜子。他的脚踝是令人震惊的苍白阴影。他的粉红色脚趾镶有黄色愈伤组织，漫长而旋转。当我越来越近时，我看到这是真的：他们没有指甲，除了几个试图恢复的蜡烛纤维。</p><p> He said that whenever people questioned his dedication to the life he had chosen, or tried to downplay his journeys as a mere lark, he would pull off his shoes, and show them his feet.</p><p> 他说，每当人们对他所选择的生活致力于他所选择的生活时，或者试图把他的旅程贬低，他会脱掉他的鞋子，向他们展示他的脚。</p><p> Extracted from  On Trails: An Exploration by Robert Moor.
