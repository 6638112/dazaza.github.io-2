Since the acquisition closed earlier this year, the CEO of Auth0, Eugenio Pace, and I have come a long way in uncovering the best ways to embrace our differences, unite our teams and learn the ins and outs of each other\u2019s leadership styles.\n Our journey so far offers lessons for other CEOs navigating partnerships with a new co-CEO or other C-suite leaders post-acquisition. Here are my top takeaways from working together during the past year.\n   It\u2019s worthwhile to put pen to paper on your company\u2019s vision ahead of an acquisition \u2014 it helps you solidify your goals in writing that you can then easily share. Before our acquisition, I wrote a long paper mapping out my five-year vision for Okta. While articulating Okta\u2019s vision is a big part of my role as CEO, I had never laid it out in this type of written format (which turned out longer than I intended \u2014 15 pages!).\n The exercise allowed me to reflect on Okta\u2019s growth over the past 12-plus years and what\u2019s to come.\n  Eugenio found it helpful in understanding my viewpoint as we started the process of learning how we\u2019d best collaborate and bring our two companies together. He\u2019d actually drafted a similar document outlining his view of success if we were to join forces. These vision documents have helped us align our goals and illustrate how we intend to scale and capitalize on our massive market opportunity.\n  With any new C-suite hire or partner, it helps to build a relationship by finding common ground and shared values. Eugenio and I knew we both placed equal importance on implementing the same \u201cnorth star\u201d guidelines for the integration: sustainable growth, putting our customers first, continued innovation, protection of our brands and empowerment of our teams.\n Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.\n  Along with our mirrored core culture values, Eugenio and I share similarities in our leadership styles and personalities that complement each other. We\u2019re introverts, and we even have the same Myers-Briggs score (INTP), translating into a natural leadership chemistry. We both take accountable, dependable leadership seriously and understand each other\u2019s work styles. Eugenio has a deep product and technology background, so we\u2019re able to get really technical when discussing and making decisions about the future of our joint companies. Our shared background also enables us to effectively share and receive feedback with each other.\n Ultimately, understanding your new partner\u2019s unique style and how you\u2019re similar (and different) can help you work together more efficiently, make faster decisions and build quick momentum.\n  Acquisitions signal that a significant threshold of success has been crossed for companies on either side of the deal. To acquire or be acquired, companies must be doing  something right and it\u2019s essential to identify the strengths within both organizations that have reaped such rewards. Combining the elements of each team that fosters an overall synergy while also protecting the unique areas is key when joining forces.\n For example, Auth0\u2019s collaborative culture has already helped Okta reignite its startup spirit. It\u2019s no easy task maintaining the same scrappy energy from the early days when we were pursuing our first 10 customers (we\u2019re now over 14,000), but Auth0 has introduced a new perspective on innovation while still allowing room to retain our respective brands and individual strengths. Auth0 is a brand beloved by developers, and its remote-first nature has also helped us navigate a dynamic work environment this year. Leveraging the strengths of the acquired company helps push your growth forward in new areas.\n  In the early stages of an acquisition, success depends on intentional and frequent communication with your new partner and team. Keep meetings and check-ins frequent, both with new leaders and with your broader employee base.\n This year, we\u2019ve regularly held full company and integrated all-hands meetings, and we\u2019ve made these meetings intentional and transparent. We format the agendas around decisions we\u2019ve made, things that won\u2019t change and what\u2019s undecided as a way to keep employees in the know while staying honest about what we\u2019re still figuring out. In any acquisition, discussions on office spaces, merged benefits and team integration timelines will inevitably arise, and giving employees an open line to ask questions and share concerns goes a long way in creating clarity and building trust.\n Acquisitions can test your team\u2019s strength and threaten existing close-knit cultures, so it takes purposeful communication to keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.\n It\u2019s worth the energy spent to make the partnership successful; Eugenio and I have worked together for less than a year, and we\u2019ve already benefited greatly from each other\u2019s perspectives and background as we move forward in this next chapter.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7528\u4e8e,navigate,\u9886\u5bfc", "title": "4\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bfc\u822a\u5458\u989d\u8ffd\u52a0\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t4 ways to navigate a post-acquisition partnership\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/4-ways-to-navigate-a-post-acquisition-partnership/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7528\u4e8e", "navigate", "\u9886\u5bfc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d22d72d6577d5d52418fe3730db12048.jpg", "infoid": 1072513, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u597d\u5947\u7684\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6Danielle Baskin\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u670d\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff08\u5982\u84dd\u8272\u652f\u7968\u5bb6\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u5632\u7b11\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u53d8\u6210\u5b9e\u9645\u516c\u53f8\uff08\u5982\u54c1\u724c\u6c34\u679c\uff09\u3002\u5979\u5230\u8fbe\u5723\u4f55\u585e\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u5927\u697c\uff0c\u5728\u62d6\u8f66\u7684\u624b\u63d0\u7bb1\uff0c\u5356\u8d43\u7269\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6885\u5c14\uff1a\u91d1\u53d1\u5047\u53d1\uff0c\u7ea2\u8272\u53e3\u7ea2\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u7684\u9ad8\u9886\u548c\u8840\u6db2\u80fd\u91cf\u996e\u6599\u3002\n\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u88ab\u7092\u4f5c\u6240\u5305\u56f4 - \u50cf\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5179\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u50cf\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b59\u5b50\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u5979\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53\u4ed6\u5728Theranos\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b59\u5b50\u6cf0\u52d2\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5c14\u8328\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u6000\u7591\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6b63\u5728\u9610\u8ff0Theranos\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u65af\u79d1\u8328\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u3002\n\u201c\u4ed6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u5728\u505a\u751f\u610f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u5b9a\u7f6a\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u5e73\u5eb8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u8ddf\u968f\u6211\u7684\u672c\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u201d\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u5728\u644a\u4f4d\u8bf4\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba9\u5979\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u798f\u5c14\u65af\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8001\u4f34\u4fa3\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u72af\u4e0b\u4e86\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u662f\u771f\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5979\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u7f6a\u6b3a\u9a97\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00\u4e5f\u5bf9Theranos\u5ba2\u6237\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u663e\u7740\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "note_en": "One of those curious onlookers was  Danielle Baskin, a San Francisco-based artist who often pokes fun at tech culture through elaborate pranks (like  Blue Check Homes) that sometimes turn into actual companies (like  Branded Fruit). She arrived at the courthouse in San Jose with a suitcase in tow, selling bootleg Holmes merch: blonde wigs, red lipstick, black turtlenecks and blood energy drinks.\n In the long cold morning outside the San Jose courthouse, I vended Elizabeth Holmes costumes out of a suitcase for anyone in the trial line.  pic.twitter.com/ITaneixBu0\n It was a joke, mocking the absurdity of the fact that someone on trial for fraud has \u201cstans\u201d who call themselves \u201c Holmies.\u201d But as Baskin watched Holmes\u2019 third day of testimony, she shared a key insight about how Theranos got so out of control.\n \u201cComing out of the Holmes trial, I think one of my biggest pieces of advice to startup founders is to have friends,\u201d Baskin  tweeted after court adjourned. \u201cYou need people in your life you enjoy hanging out with that say things like \u2018lol what are you talking about\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s a bad idea\u2019 when you say weird shit.\u201d\n  In his opening statement of the case, federal prosecutor Robert Leach described how Holmes constructed a company with a $10 billion valuation based on technology that was dangerously faulty, at best. He said that one of Holmes\u2019 techniques was to rely on \u201c false and misleading\u201d media coverage of Theranos to secure funding from investors. Holmes was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes and Inc. Magazine, and she was celebrated as one of TIME\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in 2015, lauded as a \u201ctech visionary.\u201d It made sense that people believed her vision when so many powerful people and institutions said she was the next Steve Jobs.\n  \u201cWhen I was introduced to Elizabeth by [former Secretary of State] George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate\u2019s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground,\u201d Henry Kissinger  wrote in the TIME 100 blurb about Holmes. \u201cElizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference.\u201d\n Kissinger went on to call Holmes a \u201cformidable advocate\u201d who was \u201con the verge of achieving her vision.\u201d But already, a level of uncertainty bubbled around Theranos. \u201cOthers will judge the technical aspects of Theranos, but the social implications are vast,\u201d Kissinger wrote in the final line of the blurb.\n Holmes was surrounded by hype \u2014 investors like George Shultz treated her like another grandchild. So when his grandson Tyler Shultz, who worked at Theranos, told him that he suspected Holmes was lying about the efficacy of Theranos\u2019 technology, the senior Shultz didn\u2019t believe him.\n \u201cElizabeth is a very, very charismatic person,\u201d Tyler Shultz said to  CBS News this week. \u201cWhen she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.\u201d\n  Tyler Shultz became the first whistleblower for Theranos, but at great personal and financial cost \u2014 in his audio-memoir \u201cThicker than Water,\u201d he discussed being threatened by high-profile lawyers like David Boies and being followed by  private investigators. But Shultz told a brief, yet poignant anecdote in his memoir about attending family dinners with his grandfather, who always invited Holmes and even hosted her thirtieth birthday party.\n \u201cThere was a weird situation where my parents kept telling [Holmes] to invite her parents, and they just kind of assumed that she did, and then my grandparents were talking to Elizabeth\u2019s parents on the phone, and Elizabeth\u2019s parents were completely unaware she was having a thirtieth birthday party, so it didn\u2019t seem she was very close with her parents at all,\u201d Shultz recalled. Throughout the trial, Holmes was usually seen clutching her mom\u2019s hand \u2014 but per Shultz\u2019s memory, they weren\u2019t all that close at the time of her crimes.\n Shultz goes on to describe the attendees of her birthday party: He says that he and Holmes\u2019 brother were the only people under 30, and the next youngest person was Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, who was almost 50 \u2014 he met Holmes when she was 18 and he was 37. They dated in secret for more than 10 years, unbeknownst to most Theranos employees and investors. Holmes moved in with Balwani in 2005, soon after she dropped out of Stanford.\n \u201cHe impacted everything about who I was and I don\u2019t fully understand that,\u201d Holmes testified.\n Holmes tearfully explained in court that Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her throughout their relationship. She said that he controlled what she ate, when she slept and how she behaved.\n \u201cHe told me that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished by my mediocrity, and that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,\u201d Holmes said on the stand.\n  Her defense submitted as evidence two documents that showed how Holmes was being controlled by Balwani: one was a schedule of her  daily routine, while another set  instructions for how she behaved. These guidelines would help her \u201cbecome a new Elizabeth,\u201d Holmes said Balwani told her. One \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d in her instructions declared that she would never meet with anyone \u2014 especially direct reports \u2014 for longer than five minutes unless she had written down a clear agenda for the meeting. According to the documents, her lifestyle was monastic: waking up at 4 A.M., praying, mediating, exercising, only eating certain foods and never doing anything for recreation.\n Holmes\u2019 schedule became a bit of a meme, with some journalists even  trying out her schedule for clicks \u2014 but the reality is much darker than that. It may be difficult to take Holmes\u2019 account of abuse seriously, since she\u2019s famously a liar and was just convicted of criminal fraud \u2014 but these documents, if legitimate, show a woman whose every action was being controlled by an older partner and business associate.\n \u201cHe said I needed to spend all of my time on the business, and that I should only be spending time with people who could help the business to be successful, that I needed to be working seven days a week, and I needed to be only doing things that could contribute to making the company successful,\u201d Holmes testified.\n In this context, Shultz\u2019s account of Holmes thirtieth birthday party makes more sense. She was so committed to building Theranos that she didn\u2019t seem to have any friends or hobbies, nor did she communicate enough with her parents to invite them to her birthday party.\n \u201cSunny would get very upset if I was with my family, because he said it was a distraction to the business,\u201d Holmes said in trial. Her defense referenced a  text from Balwani from Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, which said: \u201cWhen ur family is here, I feel lonely bcz u spend a total of 10 seconds with me a day.\u201d\n Maybe if Holmes had friends to confide in, someone would have told her that she was going too far by stretching the truth with investors, or that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to deliver unreliable blood test results to patients, even if her boyfriend-slash-COO said to do so. But by design, there was no one for the single-minded entrepreneur to talk to.\n  This is not to exonerate Holmes of her crimes. It can be true that she was abused by a controlling, manipulative, older partner, yet it can simultaneously be true that she committed fraud. Plus, even though she was not convicted of defrauding patients, her lies caused significant distress to Theranos customers who were given alarmingly false blood test results.\n We talk a lot about what the tech industry learned from Theranos, but we gloss over something so simple: Startup founders need to have a life outside of their job.\n We valorize founders like Elizabeth Holmes who are so dedicated to their vision that they will make huge sacrifices, abandoning their social lives to build their companies. But this isolating form of hustle culture doesn\u2019t usually breed success \u2014 it breeds burnout at best, and millions of dollars of criminal fraud at worst.\n If you\u2019re a startup founder, you\u2019re probably not the next Elizabeth Holmes.

The current boom in COVID cases is a huge bummer, but perhaps this is the last year we\u2019ll have to drag ourselves back to productivity under the specter of lockdowns, mass death and a lack of hugs. I hope so.\n Regardless, today we have a lot of fun stuff that should keep your mind off the state of the world for a few minutes.\n  Kicking off today, let\u2019s talk about Liquid Death. The excellently named company  kills thirst with  water, hence its name. That\u2019s really the company in a nutshell. Liquid Death sells water in a can, a business around which it has tailored an anti-plastic stance and a general heavy metal vibe. It\u2019s neat.\n But Liquid Death  also raised $75 million this week, which has me wondering why everything is so expensive to build these days. Why does a water company need to raise a whole pre-seed fund in a single investment? What does it need the money for? Research? It\u2019s selling water!\n There was a general perspective a few years ago that it was cheaper than ever to build a startup. With off-the-shelf software, cloud computing and modern fintech back ends, putting together the building blocks of modern business was becoming faster and less expensive. Apart from the high costs of hiring software developers, it seemed that startups would be able to do more with less.\n And yet. Startups are raising more money than ever. The Exchange is diving into venture capital data next week, but it\u2019s clear that the venture and startup classes are still moving funds around with great relish. So much so that Liquid Death has raised over $130 million to date,  per Crunchbase data.\n Square the circle of lower startup costs, and mega-rounds for me if you can. Are we seeing marketing spend raised through equity capital sources? If so, that makes me worry a bit!\n (Note that Liquid Death could be a kickass business with great margins and lovely economics; I don\u2019t know its numbers. But why does it need $75 million if it\u2019s in such good shape? What are we missing here?)\n  From deep in the notes docs, a brief note on  Level. Level is a company that  I covered back in February of 2021. The company had just closed a $1.5 million round for work we described as bringing \u201ccredit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the advance.\u201d\n It was a neat model, as lending based on assets over cash flow is a bit silly in a world where lots of folks work but don\u2019t live asset-heavy lifestyles. (That\u2019s a polite way of dissing NIMBY boomers, of course).\n Anyway, Level raised another round as 2021 closed, this time a $7 million Series A. Anthos Capital led the funding, with NextView Ventures and other prior inventors also kicking in cash. The capital came after the company grew its size by \u201c10x,\u201d per its own data.\n What I find most notable in the Level news item is not that the company raised more money \u2014 more that its goal set is super big. Per  the company, it wants to build a \u201cfinancial OS for microbusinesses.\u201d\n I dig that because tiny businesses are not the sorts of companies that get lots of attention from traditional financial institutions. Fintech should be, in my view, a method of applying tech to break down walls and bring more value to more folks. Level seems to be working along those lines, while also building a venture-ready business. Neat!\n  On the heels of news that a16z has  put together $9 billion in new funds for venture, growth and biotech investing it\u2019s easy to forget that there are smaller funds in the market as well. And some that are quite new, in fact.\n On the biotech front  PsyMed Ventures is busy raising a $25 million fund, the first close of which ($8 million) is in the bank. I chatted with the group Friday to dig in a bit more to their model.\n First, basics. PsyMed has three investing partners:  Dina Burkitbayeva,  Greg Kubin\u00a0and  Matias Serebrinsky. As you can work out from its first fund size target, it will be investing on the earlier side of things in the psychedelic medical space, along with a few related areas. The group isn\u2019t new to working together, having previously formed an investing group using AngelList tech to invest around $15 million to date.\n A few thoughts about PsyMed. First, I am hype that we\u2019re expanding the boundaries of what we\u2019re testing for medical use. Prudishness in my home country has held back this sort of work, to our detriment. Second, the biotech investing space is interesting to me as the companies founded go public a lot earlier than what we tend to see in, say, the enterprise software market. So, you get to see more about companies, more quickly and more frequently.\n For venture investors in biotech companies, this can also mean earlier liquidity possibilities than what is often seen in today\u2019s unicorn era.\n Talking with Burkitbayeva, Kubin and Serebrinsky gave me the impression that we\u2019re nearing a confluence point in terms of regulatory, scientific and medical progress that could unlock a lot of neat new treatments for some sticky human matters. Things like PTSD, treatment-resistant depression and my personal favorite, substance-use disorder.\n All this is to say that I\u2019ll be keeping out an eye for where the group puts its new fund to work and how quickly they can boost early-stage pharma startups into the public markets. Here\u2019s to reading more biotech S-1s this year and next, I suppose!\n  And that\u2019s what I have for now \u2014 don\u2019t forget that  Equity is back to its regular thrice-weekly cadence next week, so I\u2019ll chat with you on your podcasting app of choice in short order!

The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.\n   Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best \u2014 the ones who bet on you earlier than others \u2014 are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn\u2019t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.\n Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator  changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.\n \u201cWe have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,\u201d the  accelerator wrote in a post then. \u201cIn addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.\n \u201cSaid simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668,accelerators,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u542f\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u5668''\u503c\u6dfb\u52a0'\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\u5237\u65b0", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tStartup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a0\u901f\u5668", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e306d0d4b5502e34e4dd43d93da7faae.jpg", "infoid": 1072510, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2020\u5e744\u6708\uff0cNextview VC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u539a\u5b9e\u4e2d\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u800cy\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u548c500\u540d\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u5386\u53f2\u5b75\u5316\u5668\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u6279\u6b21\u5b8c\u5168\u9065\u8fdc\u548c\u6284\u5199\u961f\u5458\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u8c03\u6574\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5077\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u9884\u5148\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\nNextview\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u53d1\u5c04\u623f\u5b50\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u6837\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u8d8a\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff1a\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cBankaya\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaCeo Mauricio Cordero\uff0cRam\u00f3nChedraui\u548c\u8fed\u6208\u00b7\u74e6\u5c14\u52a0\u65af\u58f0\u79f0\u4ed6\u4eec\u964d\u843d\u4e8645\u4e07\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u542f\u52a8\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "note_en": "In April 2020,  NextView VC launched its debut accelerator in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.\n Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator  is launching its third cohort with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.\n  The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh\u2019s perspective is that the cash will \u201carm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.\u201d Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups \u2014 which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.\n \u201cIt just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,\u201d she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.\n Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they\u2019re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders  more activation energy when they need it most.\n And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThe way we engage with every company is \u2026 \u2018OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,\u2019 so we don\u2019t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.\u201d\n NextView isn\u2019t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.\n Even in a world where  capital is a commodity, investors are preparing \u2014 perhaps even more so \u2014 to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. \u201cValue add\u201d chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they\u2019re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That\u2019s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.\n For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column:  Startup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh.\n In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll dig into CES 2022 trends, a fintech startup with a contrarian view on CAC and a feature on the future of Black Girls Code. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter  @nmasc_ \u00a0or listen to me and my friends on  Equity.\n   From  smart cat collars to  color-changing cars, CES never fails to surprise us. While the TechCrunch team chose to cover the annual tech conference remotely due to surging COVID-19 cases, our reporters were all over the latest and greatest technology sneak peeks nonetheless. All of our CES coverage  can be found at this nifty link, but I recommend starting with Brian Heater\u2019s  CES 2022 themes just to wet your palate.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Stand out announcements so far include BMW\u2019s plan  to turn cars into rolling cinemas, a  mission to scale paper-based tooth brushes and, on a more serious note, a statement on the  importance of a cushion that tracks your child\u2019s temperature.\u200b\u200b\n     Bankaya! As our own Mary Ann Azevedo reports, this Mexican fintech is opting for a non-traditional strategy when it comes to acquiring customers: going offline. The new, early-stage company is targeting 50 million underbanked individuals with face-to-face advertising: think street sales and debit card kiosks strategically placed in vaccination centers.\n Here\u2019s what to know:  Just one year after launch, Bankaya co-founders CEO Mauricio Cordero, Ram\u00f3n Chedraui and Diego Vargas claim they landed 450,000 customers. And, adding to their counterintuitive strategy, the company is fully bootstrapped to date.\n     Over the holidays, news broke that Black Girls Code co-founder and  CEO Kimberly Bryant was \u201csuspended indefinitely\u201d from the nonprofit organization she launched nearly a decade ago. I spoke to the nonprofit board that decided to place her on leave, former employees who allege rising tensions between Bryant and the organization, and of course, Bryant herself to get the full story.\n Here\u2019s what to know: There\u2019s too much nuance in this story to sum it all up in a perfect blurb, so I\u2019d really recommend those interested  to read the entire story.

Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are the current weapons of choice, driving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to embrace crypto as an  investable asset class.\n Bitcoin has witnessed  strong year-to-date returns, outshining traditional hedges by  rallying over 130% compared to gold\u2019s meager 4%. In addition, increased  institutional adoption, sustained appetite for digital assets based on  weekly inflows\u00a0and growing exposure in the media strengthened bitcoin\u2019s case among weary investors.\n  If these are the moves being made by big money, they must be smart moves. However, while the prospect of hedging against bitcoin may seem enticing to retail investors, certain lingering question marks remain over its viability in mitigating financial risk for individuals.\n  The ongoing discussion of bitcoin as an inflation hedge needs to be prefaced with the fact that the currency is often susceptible to market jitters and gyrations: Bitcoin\u2019s value plummeted over  80% during December 2017, by  50% in March 2020 and by another  53% in May 2021.\n Bitcoin\u2019s ability to improve user returns and reduce volatility over the long term has yet to be proven. Traditional hedges like gold have  demonstrated efficacy in preserving purchasing power during periods of sustained high inflation \u2014 take the U.S.  during the 1970s as an example \u2014 something bitcoin has yet to be tested on. This increased risk, in turn, makes returns subject to the drastic short-term swings that sometimes affect the currency.\n  Many make the argument for bitcoin based on the fact that it\u2019s designed for a limited supply, which supposedly protects it from devaluation compared to traditional fiat currencies. While this makes sense in theory, bitcoin\u2019s price has been shown to be vulnerable to external influences. Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d are known for their ability to manipulate prices by selling or buying in large quantities, meaning that bitcoin can be dictated by speculative forces, not solely the money-supply rule.\n Another key consideration is regulation: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still at the mercy of regulators and wildly varying laws across jurisdictions. Anti-competitive laws and shortsighted regulations could significantly hamper the adoption of the underlying technology, potentially depreciating the asset\u2019s price further. All this is to say one thing: It\u2019s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.\n  Against the background of this debate, another salient trend has been driving its momentum. As bitcoin\u2019s popularity grows, it continues to drive adoption and institutionalization of the currency among consumers, including several wealthy individuals and corporations.\n A recent survey found that  72% of U.K. financial advisers have briefed their clients about investing in crypto, with nearly half of the advisers saying they believed crypto could be used to diversify portfolios as an uncorrelated asset.\n  There has also been a great deal of bitcoin advocacy from prolific individuals, known for being technologically progressive, namely billionaire Wall Street investor  Paul Tudor, Twitter CEO  Jack Dorsey,  the Winklevoss twins and  Mike Novogratz. Even powerful companies such as  Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley have expressed their interest in bitcoin as a viable asset.\n If this momentum continues, bitcoin\u2019s infamous volatility will gradually dissipate as more and more wealthy people and institutions hold the currency. Ironically, this accrual of value on the network would lead to the concentration of wealth \u2014 the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for, subject to the influence of the elite and exclusive  1%.\n In line with classical schools of financial thought, this would actually expose retail investors to greater risk, as institutional buying and selling would resemble whale-like market manipulations.\n  Bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity will no doubt lead to more people owning it, and one can argue that the people with the most money will be the ones who are going to (as usual) end up owning most of it.\n This noticeable shift of influence toward ultra-high-net-worth individuals and firms among bitcoin and other crypto circles goes against the very ethos that the Bitcoin white paper was based upon when it described a  peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n Among the  fundamental rationales for cryptocurrencies is their need to be permissionless and  resistant to censorship and control by any given institution.\n Now, as the 1% seeks a greater slice of the crypto pie, they boost the prices of these assets in the short term in a way that traditional and less influential retail investors are unable to.\n While this move would undoubtedly make a few wealthier, there is an argument to be made that this might leave the market at the mercy of the 1%, contradicting Bitcoin\u2019s intended vision.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u7535\u529b,richer,\u8d27\u5e01", "title": "\u5bcc\u88d5\u7684\u5bcc\u4eba\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u7535\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u51b2", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThe rich get richer: Rethinking Bitcoin\u2019s power as an inflation hedge\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/the-rich-get-richer-rethinking-bitcoins-power-as-an-inflation-hedge/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u7535\u529b", "richer", "\u8d27\u5e01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b43f57bd875f3c24ccf6fb98d5d35168.jpg", "infoid": 1072508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u60f3\u8981 - \u5e76\u671f\u671b - \u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u5c06\u52a0\u8f7dWhiz-Band\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u3002 CES 2022\u5305\u88f9\u672c\u5468\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6c7d\u8f66\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u535a\u4e16\u8868\u793a\u9884\u8ba1\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u5e74\u589e\u957f\u7387\u76f4\u81f32030\u5e74;\u677e\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u773c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u62ac\u5934\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u62e5\u67091000\u74e6\u548c25\u4e2a\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u7684ELS Studio 3D\u97f3\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9d\u9a6c\u63ed\u5f00\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e1a\u4e3b\u6539\u53d8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5e76\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u663e\u793a\u6570\u5b57\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u7f6e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u540e31\u82f1\u5bf8\u5267\u9662\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\n\u6839\u636eFisher\uff0cCR 2021\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u7aef\u7535\u52a8SUV\u662f\u6700\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u3002\n\u8d1d\u5c14\u5728Apple\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4e86\u8fd117\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u62db\u52df\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684Lucid Tech\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7b7e\u8ba2\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5411\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u953b\u70bc\u3002 \u201c\u4f60\u4e0d\u80fd\u8015\u79cd\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5728Lucid\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eceTier Whatevers\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u505a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u3002\u201d\n\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u6e34\u671b\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u6d88\u5931\u3002 Edmunds\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8463\u4e8b\u6770\u897f\u5361\u8003\u5fb7\u5a01\u5c14\uff08Edmunds\uff09\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u5361\u8f66\u5439\u6367\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u7528\u9014\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e70\u5bb6\u90fd\u5f88\u611f\u6fc0\u3002", "note_en": "Surveys show that consumers want \u2014 and expect \u2014 that their next car will be laden with whiz-bang features, demand that is a driver for the current bloat. CES 2022, which wrapped this week, provides a glimpse of what the future car might hold. Bosch said to expect double-digit annual growth in automotive software until 2030; Panasonic showed off an augmented reality head-up display with eye tracking, plus the ELS Studio 3D audio system with 1,000 watts and 25 speakers. BMW unveiled future technology that will allow owners to change the exterior color of their cars and display digital art inside them, not to mention a rear 31-inch Theatre Screen with  built-in Amazon Fire TV.\n And that\u2019s just a tiny sampling of the  car tech shown at CES 2022.\n  But if that tech is unreliable \u2014 as some of it has proven \u2014 then it\u2019s not a win for consumers. Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have a chip shortage; we have software bloat,\u201d said Mike Juran, CEO and co-founder of Altia, which provides graphical user interface design and tools to many automakers. \u201cThere is way too much unnecessary software out there.\u201d\n Take the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid had more than 10 million lines of code when it was introduced for the 2011 model year; \u00a0today\u2019s mid- to high-level vehicles have something like 100 million lines, said Michael Hill, vice president of engineering at Altia.\n \u201cIt\u2019s at the level you might have seen in a jet fighter 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Hill told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd there is no bug-free software.\u201d\n   \u201cToday\u2019s cars are being burdened with features consumers aren\u2019t necessarily asking for or demanding,\u201d Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports told TechCrunch.\n According to Fisher,  CR\u2019s 2021 Auto Reliability Report found that high-end electric SUVs are among the least-reliable vehicles.\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because their powertrains are problematic,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cInstead, automakers saw an opening with the early EV adopters to package the cars with all the technology they could come up with. They\u2019re trying to differentiate the product\u2013and justify the high cost. And that results in cars that aren\u2019t very reliable.\u201d\n Buggy software caused by inefficiency and coding problems are being driven by a shift \u2014 or more accurately, an acceleration \u2014 in the vehicle development cycle, according to Jason Williamson, vice president of marketing at Altia.\n \u201cPeople are used to seeing new phones every year, and automakers are trying to keep up with consumer electronics,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing to develop completely new cars in two years or less. And that means using building blocks that are maybe intended for laptops and not necessarily custom-built for automotive applications.\u201d\n It\u2019s not only expensive EVs that are enticing consumers with tech; it\u2019s happening in many mid- and upscale product lines.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more feature bloat than software bloat,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights. \u201cThe software is only there to make all the features work, and do we really need 30-way power adjustable seats with five massage-pattern options? Or sequential taillights, multi-zone automatic climate control and audio systems with concert hall and studio settings? The insatiable desire to one-up the competition is what\u2019s driving this.\u201d\n   \u201cThe hardest thing is to figure out what the feature set should be and stick to it,\u201d said Mike Bell, senior vice president of digital at Lucid Group. \u201cIt can be easier to say, \u2018We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re doing, so we\u2019re just going to throw in the whole kitchen sink.\u2019 The smart approach is to decide what customers actually want to do, then figure out how to give them the best experience. There shouldn\u2019t be seven ways to do something.\u201d\n Bell spent nearly 17 years at Apple, and recruited part of his Lucid tech team from there. He said one source of problems is that, contrary to tech company norms, automakers contract much of their software work out to suppliers. \u201cYou can\u2019t farm it out and expect to have a good experience,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Lucid, instead of buying from the tier whatevers, we do our own software and our own integration.\u201d\n  \u201cLaunching a car now is not just about the hardware, but about the software, too\u201d according to Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.\u00a0 He added in an interview that the ability to do over-the-air updates of that software \u201cmakes a big difference in consumer satisfaction. We can quickly respond to issues that come up.\u201d\n  A major factor here is consumer expectations. It\u2019s true that auto buyers don\u2019t need certain features, but they do appear to want them. A November  study from CoPilot, a data-driven car-buying app, suggests that automakers are simply responding to public demand. It found that 65.7% of current lease holders expect better feature functionality in their next car or truck, and slightly more than 56% think they\u2019ll pay about the same or less than they do for their current vehicle.\n Similarly, a September  CarMax survey of more than 1,000 car owners found that almost 50% \u201csaid they wish their current car had more tech features.\u201d\n Buyers in their 20s and 30s, a highly desirable demographic for automakers, were the most likely to say that tech features were \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as a purchase consideration. Overall, 15.9% considered the tech package extremely important; 36.7% saw it as very important; and 31.8% were in the \u201csomewhat important\u201d camp. Only 3.9% said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d important.\n  Pat Ryan, CEO and founder of CoPilot, said in an interview that consumers are likely on a collision course in three areas. \u201cFirst, it may take three to six months just to get a car, and people aren\u2019t used to that,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe second issue is that shoppers may find that their new car actually has fewer features than the one they\u2019re turning in.\n Premium sound, wireless charging, even heated seats may not be available because of the chip shortage. And people used to paying maybe 95% of the sticker price may find themselves hit with stickerplus.\u201d\n But the desire for high-tech cars is not likely to go away.

The site \u2013 named McGraths Flat \u2013 contains superb examples of fossilised animals and plants from the Miocene epoch. The team\u2019s findings were published today in   Science Advances.\n The new fossil site is located in the Central Tablelands, NSW near the town of Gulgong, and represents one of only a handful of fossil sites in Australia that can be classified as a \u2018 Lagerst\u00e4tte\u2019\u2013 a site that contains fossils of exceptional quality.\n Over the last three years a team of researchers has been secretly excavating the site, discovering thousands of specimens including rainforest plants, insects, spiders, fish and a bird feather.\n  UNSW Senior Lecturer Dr McCurry said the fossils formed between 11 and 16 million years ago and are important for understanding the history of the Australian continent.\n \u201cThe fossils we have found prove that the area was once a temperate, mesic rainforest and that life was rich and abundant here in the Central Tablelands,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n \u201cMany of the fossils that we are finding are new to science and include trapdoor spiders, giant cicadas, wasps and a variety of fish.\n \u201cUntil now it has been difficult to tell what these ancient ecosystems were like, but the level of preservation at this new fossil site means that even small fragile organisms like insects turned into well-preserved fossils.\u201d\n Associate Professor Michael Frese, who imaged the fossils using stacking microphotography and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), said that the fossils from McGraths Flat show an incredibly detailed preservation.\n \u201cUsing electron microscopy, I can image individual cells of plants and animals and sometimes even very small subcellular structures,\u201d Dr Frese said.\n \u201cThe fossils also preserve evidence of interactions between species. For instance, we have fish stomach contents preserved in the fish, meaning that we can figure out what they were eating. We have also found examples of pollen preserved on the bodies of insects so we can tell which species were pollinating which plants.\n \u201cThe discovery of melanosomes \u2013 subcellular organelles that store the melanin pigment \u2013 allows us to reconstruct the colour pattern of birds and fishes that once lived at McGraths Flat. Interestingly, the colour itself is not preserved, but by comparing the size, shape and stacking pattern of the melanosomes in our fossils with melanosomes in extant specimens, we can often reconstruct colour and/or colour patterns.\u201d\n  The fossils were found within an iron-rich rock called \u2018goethite\u2019, not usually thought of as a source of exceptional fossils. \u201cWe think that the process that turned these organisms into fossils is key to why they are so well preserved. Our analyses suggest that the fossils formed when iron-rich groundwaters drained into a billabong, and that a precipitation of iron minerals encased organisms that were living in or fell into the water,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n Dr McCurry said the fossilised plants and animals were similar to those found in rainforests of northern Australia, but that there were signs that the ecosystem at McGraths Flat was beginning to dry.\n \u201cThe pollen we found in the sediment suggests that there might have been drier habitats surrounding the wetter rainforest, indicating a change to drier conditions,\u201d he said.\n Australian Museum Chief Scientist and director of the AM\u2019s Research Institute, Professor Kristofer Helgen, said the fossil site brought to life a picture of outback Australia that we can now barely believe existed.\n \u201cAustralia is the most unique continent biologically, and this site is extremely valuable in what it tells us about the evolutionary history of this part of the world. It provides further evidence of changing climates and helps fill the gaps in our knowledge of that time and region,\u201d Prof. Helgen said.\n \u201cThe AM has a rich history of expeditions and scientific research, and we love that the public is always fascinated by these fundamental human endeavours of exploration and discovery.\u201d\n Field work at McGraths Flat was funded through the generous donation from a descendant of Robert Etheridge, an English palaeontologist who came to Australia in 1866. Etheridge joined the Australian Museum in 1887 as Assistant Palaeontologist and in 1895 was made Curator of the Museum.\n   First found in 2017, McGraths Flat is named after Nigel McGrath who discovered the first fossils from the site. The site is located near Gulgong in central NSW (Gulgong is a Wiradjuri word that means \u201cdeep waterhole\u201d).\n The Miocene Epoch (~23\u20135 million years ago) was a time of immense change in Australia. The Australian continent had separated from Antarctica and South America and was drifting northwards. When the Miocene began there was enormous richness and variety of plant and animal life in Australia. But at around 14 million years ago an abrupt change in climate known as the \u201cMiddle Miocene Disruption\u201d caused widespread extinctions. Throughout the latter half of the Miocene, Australia gradually became more and more arid, and rainforests turned into the dry shrublands and deserts that now characterise the landscape. The newly discovered fossil site, McGraths Flat, provides an unprecedented look into what Australian ecosystems were like prior to this aridification.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:34:06",

"note_en": "Study finds test works on people with concerning signs such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue\n    Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue.\n If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. The test can also tell if the disease has spread.\n  There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation. NHS rapid diagnostic centres are being set up to support faster and earlier cancer diagnosis, but often patients will be examined by their GP, and if they can\u2019t identify an obvious cause of their symptoms then the patient will simply be told to come back if they get worse.\n \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve had in the past is that if they do have cancer, that cancer is growing all the time, and when they come back the cancers are often quite advanced,\u201d said Dr James Larkin, of the University of Oxford, who was involved in the research.\n Although it is difficult to know precisely how many individuals fall into this category, \u201cit is likely to be tens of thousands of patients across the UK,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to capture these patients when they come to the GP, to give them an immediate referral option.\n \u201cThe moment you can say \u2018you have a cancer\u2019, it provides a strong incentive to send that patient for an imaging investigation to see if you can find that cancer.\u201d\n The new test utilises a technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which profiles levels of small molecules called metabolites in the blood. Healthy individuals have different metabolic \u201cfingerprints\u201d to those with localised or metastatic cancer.\n In a study published in the journal  Clinical Cancer Research, Larkin and colleagues analysed samples from 300 patients with nonspecific but concerning symptoms of cancer, such as fatigue and weight loss, and found that the test correctly detected cancer in 19 out of every 20 of those with the disease. It cannot yet pinpoint the type of tumour they have, but this is the ultimate goal.\n The test could also distinguish between patients with localised or metastatic cancer with 94% accuracy, making this the first blood test to be able to detect if a person\u2019s cancer has spread without knowing type of tumour they have.\n \u201cSuch information changes how you treat patients,\u201d Larkin said. For instance, certain immunotherapies have been shown to increase survival rates among people with metastatic cancer, but they are expensive and have side-effects. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to prescribe them to everyone, but there are patients out there that would absolutely benefit if you could only identify them early enough.\n A different type of  blood test that aims to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is being trialled in the NHS, but metabolic changes may be detectable earlier, while ctDNA technology also requires you to know which mutations to look for when finding a tumour.\n The next step is to confirm the accuracy of the test in 2,000 to 3000 British patients with nonspecific symptoms, which Larkin hopes could happen within the next two years. This data would then be submitted to national regulatory agencies responsible for authorising such tests.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:33:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bd5\u9a8c,test,\u5177\u6709", "title": "\u8840\u6db2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a3\u6709\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u75c7\u72b6\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u764c\u75c7", "title_en": "Blood Test Could Help Detect Cancer Earlier In People With Nonspecific Symptoms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/blood-test-could-help-detect-cancer-in-people-with-nonspecific-symptoms", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bd5\u9a8c", "test", "\u5177\u6709"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "08e0dad70c80a043549e73e7533f3bc3.jpg", "infoid": 1072503, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u968f\u7740\u66b4\u98ce\u96ea\u672c\u5468\u626b\u8fc7\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u5b98\u5458\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4fdd\u6301\u51ac\u5b63\u9053\u8def\u6e05\u6670\uff1a\u76d0\u3002\n\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u7531\u6c2f\u5316\u94a0\u5236\u6210\uff0c\u8868\u76d0\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u6240\u6709\u76d0\uff0c\u5927\u7ea643\uff05\u7528\u4e8e2020\u5e74\u5730\u8d28\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u516c\u8def\u53bb\u51b0\u3002\n\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u4e5f\u6709\u540e\u679c\u3002 Hintz\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6de1\u6c34\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76d0\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u5347\u9ad8\u5df2\u7ecf\u5bfc\u81f4\u6de1\u6c34\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u751f\u957f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u7e41\u6b96\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\n\u636eCary Institute\u79f0\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u7528\u76d0\u76d0\u6c34\u6eb6\u6db2\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u66b4\u5904\u7406\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u76d0\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1175\uff05\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9053\u8def\u7b49\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76d0\u50a8\u5b58\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "note_en": "As snowstorms sweep the East Coast of the United States this week, transportation officials have deployed a go-to solution for keeping winter roads clear: salt.\n But while pouring tons of salt on roads makes winter driving safer, it also has damaging environmental and health consequences, according to a growing body of research.\n As snow and ice melt on roads, the salt washes into soil, lakes and streams, in some cases contaminating drinking water reservoirs and wells. It has killed or endangered wildlife in freshwater ecosystems, with high chloride levels toxic to fish, bugs and amphibians, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires attention now,\u201d said Bill Hintz, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department at the University of Toledo and the lead author of a recent research review published in the journal  Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that freshwater ecosystems are being contaminated by salt from the use of things like road salt beyond the concentration which is safe for freshwater organisms and for human consumption,\u201d Dr. Hintz said.\n  Salt has been used to de-ice roads in the United States since the 1930s, and its use across the country has tripled in the past 50 years, Dr. Hintz said. More than 20 million metric tons of salt are poured on U.S. roads each winter, according to an estimate by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and the environmental costs are growing.\n  Still, little has been done to address the environmental impact of road salt because it is cheap and effective, said Victoria Kelly, the environmental programming manager at the Cary Institute. By lowering the freezing temperature of water, salt prevents snow from turning to ice and melts ice that is already there.\n Road salt is made from sodium chloride, the same chemical found in table salt. Of all salt consumed in the United States, about 43 percent is used for highway de-icing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in 2020.\n  The consequences of insufficiently salting roads were seen this week, when hundreds of drivers were stranded by  a snowstorm on Interstate 95 in Virginia. Officials said the storm began with rain, which washed away road salt and made it difficult to keep roads clear.  More snow fell in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast on Friday.\n But environmentalists say the problems associated with road salt are getting harder to ignore. Ms. Kelly said the accumulation of salt in drinking water reservoirs in some places was harming people on low-sodium diets.\n  A 2018 study of wells in Dutchess County, N.Y., found that sodium concentration in wells reached levels as high as 860 milligrams per liter \u2014 much higher than the  federal and state recommendation that levels not exceed 20 milligrams per liter for people on very low-sodium diets and 270 milligrams per liter for people on moderately restricted sodium diets.\n A separate 2018 study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology showed that 24 percent of private drinking wells in New York were contaminated with salt that had been used on roads. About 15 percent of people in the United States get their water from private ground wells, while the rest rely on community water systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n More counties and states are rethinking the amount of salt they use because of the associated costs. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced appointments to the Adirondack Road Salt Reduction Task Force, established to review road-salt contamination.\n \u201cI have no doubt that this group of individuals will work tirelessly to protect our state from the adverse effects of road salt,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing this group finally convene and make progress in preventing further pollution to our waterways and our environment.\u201d\n  There are consequences for wildlife, too. Dr. Hintz said his review showed that elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs.\n Card 1 of 3 Biden\u2019s climate agenda in peril.  President Biden is facing an  increasingly narrow path\u00a0to fulfill his ambitious environmental goals with the\u00a0Build Back Better Act \u2014 which contains $555 billion in proposed climate action \u2014  in limbo on Capitol Hill.\n How some cities are reducing emissions.  A district in London has developed an innovative way to  divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Stockholm and Vancouver are turning to waste heat from sewage instead.\n Sounding the alarm.  A report on the state of the Arctic  highlights troubling and consistent trends\u00a0in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are  also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica, where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.\n Road salt also corrodes vehicles and bridges, causing $5 billion in annual repairs in the United States, according to an estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. AAA suggests drivers wash and clean their vehicles regularly during winter to help offset the effects of road salt and to limit driving when salt and other de-icing chemicals are at their highest concentrations.\n In Britain, the Salt Association said that salt was the cheapest form of de-icing material and that it had a low environmental impact when used responsibly. \u201cAs with all highway maintenance activities, there are environmental implications from winter road maintenance,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cHighways depots, spreading vehicles and the de-icing agent all contribute, but with good management, this burden can be minimized.\u201d\n  While there is not a perfect solution to the issue, there are alternatives that can significantly reduce salt usage without compromising driver safety.\n One method involves treating roads before storms with a salt brine solution, which can lead to a 75 percent reduction in the amount of salt used while keeping roads just as safe, according to the Cary Institute. Building better salt storage sites can also minimize waste.\n Some counties, like Jefferson County, Wis., have already made changes. Bill Kern, the county\u2019s highway commissioner, said switching to a brine solution had enabled the county to cut its salt use by up to 60 percent since 2018 without an increase in the number of accidents. By using less salt, the county has reduced its overall cost for winter maintenance of state and county highways by 20 percent since 2018, saving about $1.6 million, Mr. Kern said.\n Over the past decade, some states, including Rhode Island, have passed legislation aimed to reduce their use of road salt and have increasingly applied a brine solution to roads in winter, but environmentalists say more needs to be done.\n  While engineers have developed better alternatives, they have not been widely implemented in part because they require upfront costs for purchasing equipment, Ms. Kelly said.\n \u201cIt\u2019ll save us money, and it\u2019ll help to save our freshwater,\u201d she said, while adding that \u201cbecause of that legacy effect, it\u2019s going to take a really long time to see the impact of the steps we take.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:32:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9053\u8def,salt", "title": "\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002", "title_en": "Road Salt Works.

He knows logic, strategy and decision-making. Widely regarded as the greatest chess player in the history of mankind, the Russian grandmaster \u2013 ranked No. 1 from 1984 to 2005 \u2013 sees the world with a certain clarity.\n So it will delight many in the blockchain industry to learn that Kasparov, easily one of the smartest people alive, is now a champion of cryptocurrency. And it\u2019s partly because of math. Kasparov has spent his \u201cretirement\u201d opposing Russian President Vladimir Putin (a defiance that once got him tossed in jail), fighting for humanitarian causes and serving as chairman of the Human Rights Foundation (a nonprofit that strongly supports  bitcoin as a freedom-giving tool). Now he views crypto as a way to check government power. Bitcoin offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, \u201cbecause you\u2019re protected by math\u201d \u2013 by the logic of the code itself.\n  Kasparov also sees merit in  non-fungible tokens. In December, in partnership with  1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against International Business Machines\u2019 artificial intelligence-powered \u201cDeep Blue\u201d and speeches against totalitarian governments.\n It\u2019s this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, \u201cI believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.\u201d\n   Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n This goes all the way back to the \u201880s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It\u2019s my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.\n  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that \u2026 governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.\n And I believe that cryptocurrencies \u2013 with bitcoin as a standard \u2013 offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you\u2019re protected by math. You\u2019re protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.\n   My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.\n We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible \u2013 and it\u2019s still impossible \u2013 to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.\n  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s money laundering. That helps bad guys.\u201d True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it\u2019s technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.\n So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not the magic wand or the terminator. It\u2019s not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It\u2019s a tool.\u201d Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it\u2019s about the balance, it\u2019s about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.\n  You mentioned crypto\u2019s ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?\n In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I\u2019m an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I\u2019m not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].\n So I think it\u2019s very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin \u2013 which I believe is online gold \u2013 and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I\u2019m not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years\u2019 time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.\n   I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying Bitcoin?\n   Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that\u2019s why you have more coins coming in. It\u2019s a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It\u2019s like the dot-com bubble. Ninety-nine point nine percent will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I\u2019m not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive \u2013 that\u2019s why I said basket of coins.\n In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?\n Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it\u2019s all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.\n I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, \u201cDo what you must, and so be it.\u201d And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.\n   I don\u2019t pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I\u2019m not aware of anything similar that exists. It\u2019s a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.\n It\u2019s all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the \u201870s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.\n The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother, and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.\n Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I\u2019ve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs, and one thing I\u2019ve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?\n The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it\u2019s a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas day last year, from COVID. And I couldn\u2019t be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.\n While she was alive, I didn\u2019t even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That\u2019s why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.\n After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I\u2019m doing a documentary now; it\u2019s in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it\u2019s for her. It\u2019s dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.\n And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.\n  The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

The protests began in the west of the country over the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread through cities across the nation.\n The internet was shut down nationwide on Wednesday. And though the intent appeared to be to disrupt the protesters\u2019 communications, the effects of the blackout have spread further.\n Kazakhstan is a power player in the bitcoin world. Last year, the nation became the world\u2019s second-largest center for bitcoin mining after the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, after China, a major hub, clamped down on crypto mining activity. As of August, Kazakhstan was hosting 18% of global bitcoin mining, according to  Fortune.\n  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or \u201cmined\u201d by high-powered computers, usually at data centers in different parts of the world that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process.\n The more miners on the network, the greater the amount of computer power is needed to mine new bitcoin. The hashrate falls if miners drop off the network, in theory making it easier for the remaining miners to produce new coin.\n The hashrate at major crypto mining pools \u2013 groups of miners in different locations that team up to produce bitcoin \u2013 was down 14% from Tuesday to Thursday, according to data from mining firm BTC.com.\n Bitcoin\u2019s price, too, took a plunge \u2013 a drop in hashrate doesn\u2019t necessarily boost price. The cryptocurrency fell below $43,000 on Thursday, testing multi-month lows.\n  Economics aside, bitcoin\u2019s negative  environmental impact has been an ongoing issue. Blockchain-based currencies require large amounts of power, which is mostly derived from fossil fuels. And in Kazakhstan, specifically, the power behind bitcoin is cause for concern.\n Coal is the main source of regional power. Kazakhstan\u2019s crypto mining farms are mostly powered by ageing coal plants which themselves \u2013 along with coalmines and whole towns built around them \u2013 are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonize the economy. Since the old plants are inefficient and carbon-heavy, they generate an outsize amount of pollution.\n According to the  International Energy Agency, Kazakhstan\u2019s emissions per energy unit are higher than what China\u2019s used to be. The agency estimates that China\u2019s coal emitted about 1,000g of CO 2 a kilowatt hour, while Kazakhstan\u2019s emits close to 1,500g.\n The Kazakh government said last year it planned to crack down first on unregistered \u201cgrey\u201d miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the \u201cwhite\u201d or officially registered ones.\n Last year, its energy ministry said that \u201cgrey\u201d mining may consume up to 1.2GW of power, which together with \u201cwhite\u201d miners\u2019 600MW comes up to about 8% of Kazakhstan\u2019s total generation capacity.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:28:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u4f18\u60e0,internet,\u6316\u6398", "title": "\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5173\u95ed\u4f18\u60e0\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u91c7\u77ff\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6253\u51fb", "title_en": "Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown Deals Blow To Global Bitcoin Mining Operation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/kazakhstan-bitcoin-internet-shutdown", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u4f18\u60e0", "internet", "\u6316\u6398"]}]
