I mean, my face, my outfit — immediately,&#34; she said. &#34;My heart dropped into my stomach.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;立即，我知道是我。我的意思是，我的脸，我的衣服 - 立即，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;我的心脏掉进了我的肚子里。＆＃34;</p><p>  Isabella, who is using a pseudonym to protect her identity, says Pornhub did not try to contact her to confirm her age or to ask whether the video had been consensual.</p><p>  Isabella是使用假名来保护她的身份的伊莎贝拉，说Pornhub没有试图联系她来确认她的年龄或询问视频是否是同意的。</p><p> CBS News spoke with four of the 34 women, including Isabella, who have joined a lawsuit against MindGeek, the company behind Pornhub and dozens of the world&#39;s most popular pornography websites.</p><p> CBS新闻与34名女性中的四个（包括伊莎贝拉）共同谈到伊莎贝拉，他加入了对阵MindGeek的诉讼，这是Pornhub背后的公司和数十个世界上最受欢迎的色情网站。</p><p> The civil suit, filed Thursday, accuses the company of running a &#34;criminal enterprise.&#34; Pornhub markets itself as a mainstream site for adult content and says it yields 130 million users each day — more than Netflix or Amazon. But the women suing the company have accused it of exploiting them for profit, hosting and promoting graphic videos of rape, revenge porn and even videos that depict child sexual abuse.</p><p> 本周审议的民事诉讼指责公司运行A＆＃34;犯罪企业。＆＃34; Pornhub市场作为成人内容的主流网站，并表示每天获得1.3亿用户 - 超过Netflix或亚马逊。但是，苏公司的妇女指责它利用他们的利润，托管和促进强奸，复仇色情甚至视频描绘儿童性虐待的视频。</p><p>  Isabella said more than 200,000 people ultimately watched the video — &#34;including everybody at my college, pretty much,&#34; she said.</p><p>  伊莎贝拉表示，超过20万人最终观看了视频 - ＆＃34;包括我大学的每个人，几乎和＃34;她说。 </p><p> &#34;The view count on the video will forever haunt my dreams,&#34; she said. &#34;Just knowing that that many people saw it really messed me up.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;视频依靠视频将永远困扰我的梦想，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;只知道很多人看到它真的搞砸了我。＆＃34;</p><p> After learning how many people had seen her video on Pornhub, she said she battled with a sense of shame and worthlessness and had to transfer schools. She couldn&#39;t look in a mirror for six months and drew into isolation, she said, fearful that people at her new school would recognize her.</p><p> 在学习有多少人在Pornhub上看到了她的视频，她说她用一种羞耻感和毫无价值的感兴趣，不得不转移学校。她不能看镜子六个月，汲取镜子，她说，害怕她新学校的人会认识到她。</p><p> And she struggled with the feeling that she&#39;d brought this on herself. &#34;It&#39;s taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I am a victim of something,&#34; she said.</p><p> 她挣扎着她＆＃39; d带给自己的感觉。 ＆＃34;它带着我很长时间来对待这一事实，因为我是某事的受害者，＆＃34;她说。</p><p>   The lawsuit alleges that Pornhub&#39;s business model is built around funneling online traffic to videos like Isabella&#39;s.</p><p>   该诉讼声称Pornhub＆＃39; S的商业模式是在漏斗的在线流量到Isabella＆＃39; s等视频。</p><p>  MindGeek owns and operates more than 100 pornographic websites, and its brands include Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn and Xtube. MindGeek also owns porn production companies that create content, but for years, a majority of the content on Pornhub was uploaded by unverified users. MindGeek operates some paid-subscription sites, but Pornhub is free for anyone to access and earns money through advertising revenue and optional, premium subscriptions.</p><p>  MindGeek拥有并运营100多个色情网站，其品牌包括Pornhub，RedTube，Youporn和Xtube。 MindGeek还拥有色情制作公司，创造内容，但多年来，未经验证的用户上传了Pornhub上的大部分内容。 MindGeek经营了一些付费订阅网站，但Pornhub是免费的，供任何人通过广告收入和可选的优质订阅来获取和获得资金。</p><p> Isabella said she decided to join the lawsuit to protect other victims. A draft of the lawsuit says MindGeek &#34;embraced under-age, non-consensual, and pirated content in its business&#34; and claims the company &#34;profited from content produced through human trafficking.&#34;</p><p> 伊莎贝拉表示，她决定加入诉讼来保护其他受害者。诉讼草案介绍了MindGeek＆＃34;在其业务和＃34中接受了欠款，非同意和盗版的内容;并索赔公司＆＃34;从人口贩运的内容中获利。＆＃34;</p><p> Michael Bowe, the lawyer representing the women, said the company has skirted rules that have long been in place to protect actors in the &#34;traditional&#34; porn industry, which requires producers to verify the age and identities of the people featured in videos.</p><p> 代表妇女的律师Michael Bowe表示，该公司拥有长期以来一直在进行＆＃34;传统＆＃34;色情产业，需要生产者核实视频中的人民的年龄和身份。 </p><p> &#34;The online porn industry has essentially been the Red Light District of commerce,&#34; Bowe said. &#34;This new industry of online porn, for the last 10 years, has been allowed by law enforcement, government entities, to operate by a different set of rules. Basically, no rules or oversight.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;在线色情产业基本上是红灯区的商业，＆＃34; Bowe说。 ＆＃34;这个新的在线色情行业，过去10年来，执法人员，政府实体，由不同的规则运作。基本上，没有规则或监督。＆＃34;</p><p> Bowe has spent the past year building a civil case against the company based on racketeering laws normally used to go after mobsters and drug gangs.</p><p> Bowe在过去的一年里，在通常习惯于在Mobsters和毒品帮派之后，基于克服的法律对该公司建立一个民事案件。</p><p> Last December, after a wave of backlash over nonconsensual content on the platform, Mastercard and Visa blocked card users from making purchases on Pornhub. Under scrutiny, MindGeek announced an overhaul of its procedures and took down millions of videos uploaded by unverified users, deleting 80% of the content on its site.</p><p> 去年12月，在平台上的非呼吸内容的一波反对跳闸后，万事达卡和签证被阻止的卡片用户在Pornhub上购买。在审查下，MindGeek宣布大修其程序，并取消了未验证的用户上传了数百万个视频，删除了其网站上的80％内容。</p><p>  MindGeek executives also announced last year that they had removed the ability for users to download videos and added a requirement that people posting videos verify their identification.</p><p>  MindGeek高管还宣布去年他们删除了用户下载视频的能力，并增加了人们发布视频验证其身份的识别。</p><p>   &#34;We are committed to eradicating illegal content,&#34; the company said in a statement to CBS News, adding that earlier this year, the company enacted &#34;the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history.&#34;</p><p>   ＆＃34;我们致力于消除非法内容，＆＃34;该公司在CBS新闻发表声明中表示，今年早些时候在颁布的公司颁布＆＃34;用户生成的平台历史上最全面的保障措施。＆＃34;</p><p> The statement said, &#34;We have banned uploads from unverified users, eliminated downloads, expanded our moderation processes, and partnered with dozens of non-profit organizations around the world, steps that surpass those of any other major platform on the internet.&#34;</p><p> 该声明说，＆＃34;我们已禁止从未验证的用户上传，消除下载，扩大我们的审核流程，并与世界各地的数十个非营利组织合作，超越了互联网上任何其他主要平台的步骤。 ＆＃34;</p><p> In a statement Thursday after the lawsuit was filed, MindGeek said the allegations in the complaint that Pornhub is a &#34;criminal enterprise&#34; are &#34;utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false.&#34;</p><p> 在提起诉讼后星期四的一份声明中，MindGeek表示，投诉中的指控是Pornhub是A＆＃34;犯罪企业＆＃34;是＆＃34;完全荒谬，完全鲁莽和明确的假。＆＃34; </p><p> During a February hearing before the Canadian House of Commons, MindGeek&#39;s CEO Feras Antoon decried online child abuse imagery. &#34;Sexual material, child abuse material has no place on our platform. It makes us lose money,&#34; he said. &#34;It completely ruins the brand that we have been trying to build for over a decade.&#34;</p><p>在2月份在Canadian House of Commons，Mindgeek＆＃39;首席执行官Feras Antoon谴责在线儿童虐待图像。 ＆＃34;性材料，儿童虐待材料在我们的平台上没有地方。它让我们赔钱，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;它完全破坏了我们一直在努力建设的品牌。＆＃34;</p><p> But the company still does not require its users to verify the identity or age of those featured in its videos, something that&#39;s standard in the traditional porn industry. The company also doesn&#39;t seek to confirm the consent of everyone who appears in videos posted to the site, a measure that victims of abuse believe would help keep nonconsensual content off porn sites.</p><p> 但该公司仍然不要求其用户核实其视频中特色的身份或年龄，即传统色情产业中的标准品＆＃39;标准。该公司也没有寻求确认出现在该网站的视频中的每个人的同意，这一措施认为虐待的受害者认为有助于保持非责备内容的色情网站。</p><p> Some of the victims in the lawsuit told CBS News they joined after they discovered their non-consensual videos on Pornhub and reached out to an activist named Laila Mickelwait. In 2020, Mickelwait founded a campaign called Traffickinghub which started a petition to &#34;Shut Down Pornhub.&#34; She told CBS News it now has more than 2 million signatures.</p><p> 诉讼中的一些受害者告诉CBS新闻，他们在他们在Pornhub上发现了他们的非同意视频后，他们加入了一个名叫Laila Mickelwait的活动家。 2020年，Mickelwait创立了一个名为ComcketicaingHub的运动，该活动开始了＆＃34;关闭色情鼠。＆＃34;她告诉CBS新闻现在拥有200多万签名。</p><p>  During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in March, Mickelwait called Pornhub a &#34;mega-sex trafficker,&#34; and said the site was infested with non-consensual pornographic content. &#34;The company knowingly has enabled and profited from mass amounts of sex acts induced by force, fraud or coercion, and the commercial sexual abuse of children,&#34; she said.</p><p>  在众议院金融服务委员会在3月份的证词期间，Mickelwait称为Pornhub A＆＃34; Mega-Sex贩运者，＆＃34;并说该网站被非同意的色情内容感染了。 ＆＃34;公司故意启用并从武力，欺诈或胁迫诱导的大众数量的性行为中获利，以及儿童的商业性虐待，＆＃34;她说。</p><p>   Traffickinghub says it&#39;s &#34;powered by&#34; a religious organization called Exodus Cry, which has been criticized for its efforts to criminalize parts the sex industry and abolish pornography altogether. On its website, Exodus Cry advocates for laws to &#34;end the sex industry&#34; and &#34;reduce the demand for commercial sex.&#34;</p><p>   贸易的Hub说它＆＃39; s＆＃34;由＆＃34提供动力;宗教组织称为Exodus Cry的宗教组织，这已批评其努力使性产业和废弃色情部分定为犯罪。在其网站上，Exodus Cry admocates＆＃34;结束性行业＆＃34;和＆＃34;减少对商业性的需求。＆＃34;</p><p> Pornhub&#39;s executives have said the company was designed to celebrate freedom of expression and empower adults. And in its statement Thursday, the company claims Bowe is a &#34;soldier of the ultra-right wing effort to shut down the adult content industry.&#34;</p><p> Pornhub＆＃39;高管表示，该公司旨在庆祝表达自由和赋予成年人。在其周四的声明中，该公司声称Bowe是A＆＃34;超右翼努力的士兵关闭了成人内容行业。＆＃34;</p><p> But Bowe said his goal isn&#39;t to ban online pornography, but rather, to force it to comply with regulations.</p><p> 但是Bowe说他的目标是禁止在线色情内容，而是强迫它遵守法规。 </p><p> He told CBS News: &#34;This case is not about porn, it&#39;s about rape. This is a legitimate industry that consenting people have every right to participate in. It just needs to be done legally and not with illegal content.&#34;</p><p>他告诉CBS新闻：＆＃34;这种情况不是关于色情，它的关于强奸的＆＃39;这是一个合法的行业，同意人们每一个参与。它只需要合法而不是非法内容。＆＃34;</p><p> Of the 34 women suing the company, 14 said they were underage in videos uploaded to PornHub, and 14 were victims of people charged or convicted of sex crimes.</p><p> 14中，为期34名女性，14表示，他们是上传到Pornhub的视频中的未成年人，14人是被指控或被判犯有性犯罪的人受害者。</p><p>  One of those victims is Aubrey, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity. She says her ex-husband secretly recorded a video of them having sex, then uploaded it to Pornhub without her consent or her knowledge. The ex-husband now faces criminal charges of forcible rape, domestic assault and non-consensual dissemination of private sexual images by posting the video on Pornhub.</p><p>  其中一个受害者是Aubrey，谁也使用假名来保护她的身份。她说，她的前夫秘密录制了一个有性行为的视频，然后在没有她的同意或她的知识的情况下将其上传到Pornhub。前丈夫现在面临强奸强奸，国内攻击和非自愿传播私有性图像的刑事指控，通过在Pornhub上发布视频。</p><p> Aubrey learned about the video from a friend in 2018, after she said it had garnered more than 400,000 views.</p><p> Aubrey于2018年从一位朋友那里了解了视频，在她说它已经获得了40万个意见后，这是一个朋友。</p><p>   &#34;I will never, ever be able to recover the emotional pain that this has caused me,&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;It truly, truly was a living nightmare. I — I didn&#39;t — everybody had seen everything about me. And that&#39;s just — that&#39;s a very private moment. And it&#39;s a very vulnerable moment. And it&#39;s just — it&#39;s hard to come to terms with. That the world has seen that.&#34;</p><p>   ＆＃34;我永远不会恢复这让我造成的情绪痛苦，＆＃34; Aubrey说。 ＆＃34;真的，真的是一个活着的噩梦。我 - 我没有＃39; t  - 每个人都看到了关于我的一切。那个＆＃39;＆＃39;这是一个非常私人的时刻。它和＃39;是一个非常脆弱的时刻。和它＆＃39;它只是 - 它很难与之来之吻。世界已经看到了这一点。＆＃34;</p><p> Aubrey said she struggled to convince Pornhub to remove her video. Emails reviewed by CBS News show that after she contacted the company to tell them the video was not taken consensually, a Pornhub representative challenged her.</p><p> Aubrey表示，她努力说服色情酒瓶去除她的视频。通过CBS新闻审核的电子邮件显示，在她联系公司后告诉他们该视频是不合作的，色情挑战她的挑战。</p><p> He asked, &#34;Are you the female in the video? How do you know this is you?&#34;</p><p> 他问道，＆＃34;你是视频中的女性吗？你怎么知道这是你？＆＃34; </p><p> Aubrey responded, &#34;I know this is me by several things. That is my bed, I have a mole on my right hip, that is my face, my voice, THAT IS ME and I am pissed.&#34;</p><p>Aubrey回应，＆＃34;我知道这是我几件事。那是我的床，我的右臀部有一个痣，这是我的脸，我的声音，这就是我，我很生气。＆＃34;</p><p> After a three-day exchange, Pornhub took down the video, but even then, Aubrey said she found it posted to other porn websites — renamed and re-uploaded, by users she didn&#39;t know.</p><p> 经过三天的交换后，Pornhub取下了视频，但即便如此，Aubrey说她发现它发布到其他色情网站 - 重命名并重新上传，由她没有知道的用户。</p><p> She said she felt defeated to know that the video was still online. &#34;I felt like everything was taken away from me. And I had no power. I had no say in it. I was completely powerless,&#34; she said.</p><p> 她说她觉得被打败了解视频仍然在线。 ＆＃34;我觉得一切都被带走了。我没有权力。我没有说。我完全无能为力，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> One former executive, who worked at MindGeek before the company overhauled its policies, provided information included in the lawsuit against MindGeek. He said that illegal content was seen as &#34;good&#34; for business. He agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. He fears retribution.</p><p> 在公司审查其政策之前，在思维克曾在思维克工作过的前任主管，提供了对阵思维诉讼中的信息。他说，非法内容被视为＆＃34;好＆＃34;商业用途。他同意对匿名的条件进行面谈。他担心报复。</p><p>   He said the company favored keeping more content on the site. &#34;I mean, if you offer everything on the site, there is something for everyone,&#34; he said. &#34;The more you have, the better it is. So for all the free sites like Pornhub, more content is always better.&#34;</p><p>   他表示，该公司赞成在网站上保持更多内容。 ＆＃34;我的意思是，如果您在网站上提供所有内容，那么每个人都有一些东西，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;你拥有的越多，它就越好。因此，对于Pornhub等所有免费网站，更多的内容总是更好。＆＃34;</p><p> He said when content was flagged on PornHub, MindGeek often moved it to one of the dozens of other porn sites it owned. &#34;Removed content popped up on all their other sites and no one really cared,&#34; he said.</p><p> 他说，当内容被标记为Pornhub时，MindGeek经常将其移到它拥有的其他几个色情网站之一。 ＆＃34;删除内容在所有其他网站上弹出，没有人真正关心，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> In its statement to CBS News, MindGeek said: &#34;The spread of illegal content is an existential threat to the internet, and every platform has the moral obligation to join the fight against it. Illegal material on the internet harms its victims, internet users and all platforms that operate online. Any suggestion that the company tolerates or celebrates this material is patently false.&#34;</p><p> 在其对CBS新闻的声明中，Mindgeek说：＆＃34;非法内容的传播是对互联网的存在威胁，每个平台都有道德义务加入抗击它。互联网上的非法材料危害其受害者，互联网用户和在线运营的所有平台。该公司容忍或庆祝此材料的任何建议都是假的。＆＃34; </p><p>   One victim, Michelle, who is using a pseudonym, said that she was targeted at age 15 by an abuser who has since been convicted of blackmailing children to sexually abuse themselves on camera.</p><p>使用假名的一个受害者米歇尔表示，她被一名虐待者瞄准了15岁，因为被判犯有勒索儿童在相机上进行性虐待自己的虐待儿童。</p><p> She said he coerced her to take sexual photos and videos, which he later sold as &#34;box sets&#34; to other offenders. Some of those videos were uploaded to Pornhub, and from there, she said, they spread.</p><p> 她说他强迫她采取性照片和视频，他后来出售为＆＃34;盒装＆＃34;到其他罪犯。其中一些视频被上传到Pornhub，从那里开始，她说，他们传播。</p><p> She said that the videos&#39; uploads on Pornhub had &#34;way, way worse&#34; of an impact on her than even her blackmailer&#39;s initial abuse. &#34;It was only when my videos went on sites like Pornhub that my life started to become something that I couldn&#39;t live out properly,&#34; she said, adding that she stopped eating, leaving the house and once attempted suicide.</p><p> 她说视频＆＃39;在Pornhub上上传有＆＃34;方式，方式＆＃34;对她的影响甚至是她的敲诈勒比甚至是她的初始滥用。 ＆＃34;只有当我的视频像Pornhub这样的网站上时，我的生活开始成为我无法进入的东西，＆＃34;她说，补充说她停止吃，离开房子，一旦尝试自杀。</p><p> Michelle reported the videos to Pornhub during the fall of 2018 and continued flagging content for the site to take down throughout 2019. And although Pornhub took down all unverified content last year, Michele said she continues to find images of her abuse re-uploaded on other websites. She said, &#34;Any other place I find my videos there&#39;s some type of mention of Pornhub or where they originated from, and my name was always with them.&#34;</p><p> Michelle在2018年秋天报告了Pornhub的视频，并继续在2019年中断的网站上的内容。虽然Pornhub去年取消了所有未验证的内容，但Michele表示，她继续寻找她滥用的图像重新上传网站。她说，＆＃34;任何其他地方我在那里找到了我的视频＆＃39;这一定的文字或他们源自的地方，我的名字总是在于它们。＆＃34;</p><p>   Strangers continue to contact her about her videos, she said, and one man even showed up at her house, telling her that he&#39;d found her through Pornhub.</p><p>   陌生人继续联系她关于她的视频，她说，一个人甚至在她的房子上出现，告诉她他通过Pornhub发现了她。</p><p> The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which investigates reports of child sexual abuse, told CBS News that MindGeek began reporting suspected child abuse to their Cyber Tipline in April 2020, and throughout 2020, reported more than 13,000 instances of child sexual abuse imagery. In its statement, MindGeek said those reports represent approximately 4,000 unique incidents.</p><p> 调查儿童性虐待报告的国家缺失和剥削儿童中心告诉CBS消息，即Mindgeek于2020年4月开始将疑似儿童滥用嫌疑人滥用，并在整个2020年期间报告了13,000多个儿童性虐待图像实例。在其声明中，MindGeek表示，这些报告代表了大约4,000个独特事件。</p><p> &#34;According to leading advocates, non-profits and third-party analyses, Pornhub&#39;s safeguards and technologies have proven effective,&#34; the statement said, adding that according to  the center&#39;s data, one major social media platform was responsible for more than 20 million reports.</p><p> ＆＃34;根据领先的倡导者，非营利组织和第三方分析，Pornhub＆＃39; Saveguards和Technologies已被证明是有效的，＆＃34;该声明说，根据中央的数据，一个主要的社交媒体平台根据中央和＃39的数据，负责超过2000万的报告。 </p><p> Despite that, the center said that victims and survivors who contact them &#34;express frustration&#34; with MindGeek&#39;s record in removing sexually abusive content, noting their expectations for MindGeek to take greater steps to proactively identify and remove the content from its site.</p><p>尽管如此，该中心表示，联系它们的受害者和幸存者＆＃34;快递挫败感＆＃34;通过MindGeek＆＃39;记录在删除性虐待内容中，注意到他们对MindGeek的期望采取更大的措施来主动识别和从其网站上删除内容。</p><p> The center added that it receives information from the public about suspected child sexual abuse imagery on MindGeek sites &#34;on a daily basis.&#34;</p><p> 该中心补充说，它收到了公众关于令人疑似的儿童性虐待地图像的信息，在思维态度＆＃34上;每天。＆＃34;</p><p>  Another victim, Ashley, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity, said in August of last year, she learned that Pornhub was hosting a video of her being assaulted while unconscious.</p><p>  另一个受害者Ashley，谁也使用假名来保护她的身份，在去年八月表示，她了解到Pornhub正在举办她在无意识时遭到殴打的视频。</p><p> She said her then-husband drugged and raped her, and had posted the assault on Pornhub. The video was tagged &#34;sleeping pills,&#34; and she says it had been on the site for three years and racked up tens of thousands of views before she learned of its existence.</p><p> 她说她的那个丈夫被吸毒并强奸了她，并张贴了Pornhub的攻击。视频是标记的＆＃34;睡药，＆＃34;她说它已经在该网站上了三年，并且在学到了它的存在之前，成了数千个观点。</p><p>   Her abuser was arrested last week on charges of sexual assault, distributing intimate images without consent and indecent exposure. She said his arrest came as a relief, but she hopes MindGeek will be held responsible too.</p><p>   她的施虐者上周被逮捕了对性侵犯的指控，在没有同意和不雅暴露的情况下分配亲密的形象。她说，他的逮捕是一个救济，但她希望思维是责任的。</p><p> Ashley said the changes the company made to their site last year, which require users to upload a government-issued ID in order to post content, may not have prevented a situation like hers.</p><p> Ashley表示，该改变公司去年向其网站提出的，要求用户上传政府颁发的ID，以便发布内容，可能没有阻止像她这样的情况。</p><p> &#34;Of course you have consent from the person uploading the video.
