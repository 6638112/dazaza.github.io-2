The drive wheel also has an elevated circular blocking disc that &#34;locks&#34; the rotating driven wheel in position between steps.\n     The name, Geneva drive, is derived from the devices earliest application in  mechanical watches, which were popularized in  Geneva, being the classical origin of watchmaking industry [   citation needed]. The mechanism is frequently used in mechanical  watches, since it can be made small and is able to withstand substantial mechanical stress.\n The  Geneva drive is also called a &#34; Maltese cross mechanism&#34; due to the visual resemblance when the rotating wheel has four  spokes.\n In the most common arrangement of the Geneva drive, the client wheel has four slots and thus advances the drive by one step at a time (each step being 90  degrees) for each full rotation of the master wheel. If the steered wheel has  n slots, it advances by 360\u00b0/ n per full rotation of the propeller wheel.\n Because the mechanism needs to be well lubricated, it is often enclosed in an oil capsule. [   citation needed]\n    One application of the Geneva drive is in film  movie projectors and movie cameras, where the film is pulled through an exposure gate with periodic starts and stops. The film advances frame by frame, each frame standing still in front of the lens for a portion of the frame cycle (typically at a rate of 24 cycles per second), and rapidly accelerating, advancing, and decelerating during the rest of the cycle. This intermittent motion is implemented by a Geneva drive, which in turn actuates a claw that engages sprocket holes in the film. The Geneva drive also provides a precisely repeatable stopped position, which is critical to minimizing jitter in the successive images. (Modern film projectors may also use an electronically controlled indexing mechanism or  stepper motor, which allows for fast-forwarding the film.) The first uses of the Geneva drive in film projectors date to 1896, with the projectors of  Oskar Messter and Max Gliewe and the  Teatrograph of  Robert William Paul. Previous projectors, including  Thomas Armat&#39;s projector, marketed by  Edison as the  Vitascope, had used a &#34;beater mechanism&#34;, invented by  Georges Demen\u00ff in 1893, to achieve intermittent film transport.\n Geneva wheels having the form of the driven wheel were also used in mechanical  watches, but not in a drive, rather to limit the tension of the  spring, such that it would operate only in the range where its  elastic force is nearly linear. If one of the slots of the driven wheel is occluded, the number of rotations the drive wheel can make is limited. In watches, the &#34;drive&#34; wheel is the one that winds up the spring, and the Geneva wheel with four or five spokes and one closed slot prevents overwinding (and also complete unwinding) of the spring. This so-called  Geneva stop or &#34;Geneva stop work&#34; was the invention of 17th or 18th century watchmakers.\n Other applications of the Geneva drive include the pen change mechanism in  plotters, automated sampling devices,  banknote counting machines, and many forms of  indexable equipment used in manufacturing (such as the tool changers in  CNC machines; the turrets of  turret lathes,  screw machines, and turret drills; some kinds of  indexing heads and  rotary tables; and so on). The  Iron Ring Clock uses a Geneva mechanism to provide intermittent motion to one of its rings.\n A Geneva drive was used to change filters in the  Dawn mission framing camera used to image the asteroid  4 Vesta in 2011. It was selected to ensure that should the mechanism fail at least one filter would be usable.  [1]  [2]\n  An internal Geneva drive is a variant on the design. The axis of the drive wheel of the internal drive can have a bearing only on one side. The angle by which the drive wheel has to rotate to effect one step rotation of the driven wheel is always smaller than 180\u00b0 in an external Geneva drive and always greater than 180\u00b0 in an internal one, where the switch time is therefore greater than the time the driven wheel stands still.\n  The external form is the more common, as it can be built smaller and can withstand higher mechanical  stresses. [   citation needed]\n       The figure shows the motion curves for an external four-slot Geneva drive, in arbitrary units. A discontinuity appears in the acceleration when the drive pin enters and leaves the slot, occurring at the instant the rigid bearing surfaces make contact or separate. This generates an &#34;infinite&#34; peak of  jerk ( Dirac peak), and therefore vibrations.\n    ^    Christopher Russell; Carol Raymond (2012).

", "note_en": "Two dreaded coronavirus variants are swiftly overthrowing the previously most-dreaded variant in the US. Their ascendance is making experts worry that the country could see continued outbreaks and resurgences of COVID-19 unless the current sluggish pace of vaccination quickens.\n Alpha\u2014the variant formerly known as B.1.1.7 and first identified in the UK\u2014swept the country at the start of the year. It\u2019s estimated to be around 50 percent more transmissible than the version of the pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that mushroomed out of Wuhan, China, in 2020. Alpha\u2019s rise in the UK last fall was linked to a surge in cases as the virus variant quickly accounted for more than 90 percent of cases there. Likewise, in the US, Alpha became the predominant strain in a matter of months this year and accounted for around 70 percent of the circulating strains by the end of April.\n But according to  fresh data, two other variants now threaten Alpha\u2019s reign in the US: Delta (aka B.1.617.2, first detected in India) and Gamma (aka P.1, first detected in Brazil and Japan). Delta is considered the most concerning variant seen yet. Though vaccines are still effective against Delta, the variant is estimated to be 50 percent to 60 percent more contagious than Alpha, and evidence suggests that it may cause more severe disease. When Delta first appeared in the UK at the start of April, it rapidly overcame Alpha and now accounts for around 90 percent of cases. Gamma, on the other hand, is not such a rapid spreader, but it does slightly knock back the effectiveness of vaccines.\n According to the data posted online Monday on a preprint server, Delta and Gamma are wasting no time collectively overtaking Alpha in the US, which has already fallen from dominance. Alpha dropped from 70 percent of cases in April to its current low of around  35 percent. In the preprint study, Delta and Gamma collectively made up around 30 percent of all case in the US as of June 9, with Delta making up around 14 percent of cases and Gamma making up around 16 percent.\n Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented in a White House press conference Tuesday estimate that, as of June 19, Delta\u2019s share of cases nationwide is now up to  20.6 percent.\n     The preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed, was run by California-based researchers at the genomics company Helix. The company is working with the CDC to help monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants. Helix researchers had data on nearly 244,000 positive SARS-CoV-2 samples collected since January 2021. And they had the genetic sequences of nearly 20,000 virus isolates collected across 747 counties nationwide since April.\n The study has limitations, most notably the smaller number of samples collected in recent weeks given a welcomed slowdown in transmission. Though the authors suggest their data set shouldn\u2019t be biased toward any specific variant, they do note that the samples \u201cdo not proportionally represent the different areas of the United States by population.\u201d About 25 percent of the samples were collected from Florida, for instance. However, when they did break out analyses, they could still see nationwide trends.\n Overall, the data was clear that Delta and Gamma are taking over. And Delta in particular is spreading the fastest. It is outpacing Gamma and set to become the predominant variant in the US, as it did in the UK.\n Still, both variants have advantages. When the researchers looked at how the two variants were spreading in various counties, they found that:\n The growth curve for [Delta], which is more transmissible but against which vaccines are highly effective, shows faster growth in counties with lower vaccination rates. In contrast, [Gamma], which is less transmissible but against which vaccines have somewhat less efficacy, has a higher prevalence in counties with higher vaccination rates.\n The data supports experts\u2019 calls for people to get vaccinated and for vaccinated people to remain vigilant. In the White House press briefing Tuesday, top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci echoed the concern, calling Delta the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the country\u2019s path out of the pandemic.\n  Fauci noted that 34 states have less than 70 percent of their adult populations vaccinated. There\u2019s a \u201creal danger,\u201d Fauci said, that the Delta variant could drive local surges in COVID-19 cases into the fall in places with low vaccination rates.\n \u201cConclusion: We have the tools,\u201d he said, referring to effective vaccines, \u201cso let\u2019s use them and crush the outbreak.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 07:00:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53d8\u4f53,alpha,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u66fe\u7ecf\u53ef\u6015\u7684alpha\u53d8\u4f53\u843d\u5728\u5feb\u901f - \u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\uff0c\u4f3d\u739b\u63a5\u7ba1 ", "title_en": "Once-dreaded Alpha variant is falling fast\u2014Delta and Gamma take over", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/delta-and-gamma-variants-reign-begins-as-alpha-drops-from-70-to-35-of-cases/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d8\u4f53", "alpha", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bbc6a59e65864049479ec7dba05d5612.jpg", "infoid": 1067583, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Teamsters\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u5144\u5f1f\u4f1a\u5c06\u5728\u5468\u56db\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u4ee5\u89c4\u6a21\u52aa\u529b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5de5\u4eba\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5bfb\u6c42\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u9001\u8d27\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u4f1a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\n \u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u4f1a\u4e4b\u4e00\u5c06\u4e8e\u5468\u56db\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e3e\u529e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4ed3\u5e93\u5de5\u4eba\u548c\u53f8\u673a\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u6e05\u626b\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\n Teamsters\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u5144\u5f1f\u4f1a\u662f\u672c\u5468\u6536\u96c6\u5176\u5e74\u5ea6\u516c\u7ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5bf9\u65e8\u5728\u4f7f\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5de5\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u8054\u76df\u5408\u540c\u7684\u51b3\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u7968\n  \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u56e2\u961f\u8ba1\u5212\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u5176\u7a0e\u6536\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5e08\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8be5\u51b3\u8bae\u6848\u7684\u526f\u672c\uff0c\u5c06\u5728\u5176\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u8d44\u52a9\u548c\u534f\u52a9\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u7531\u526f\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u9884\u8ba1\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u62d2\u7edd\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Jeff Bezos\u6700\u8fd1\u627f\u8ba4\u516c\u53f8\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5458\u5de5\u524d\u8fdb\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u3002\n \u6295\u7968\u4ec5\u4ec5\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u963f\u62c9\u5df4\u9a6c\u5dde\u4e3e\u884c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5931\u8d25\u540e\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u3002 4\u6708\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\uff06\uff0339;\u4ed3\u5e93\uff0c\u963f\u62c9\u5df4\u9a6c\u5dde\uff0c\u4ed3\u5e93\u538b\u5012\u6027\u5730\u53cd\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f1a\uff0c\u5c11\u4e8e30\uff05\u7684\u9009\u7968\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u96f6\u552e\uff0c\u6279\u53d1\u548c\u767e\u8d27\u5546\u5e97\u8054\u76df\u3002 \n\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u4f1a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7684\u7cae\u98df\u548camp;\u5546\u4e1a\u5de5\u4eba\u8054\u76df\u548cRwdsu\u6084\u6084\u5730\u4e0e\u4ed3\u5e93\u548c\u9001\u8d27\u5de5\u4eba\u89c1\u9762\u3002 Coronavirus\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u9ed1\u4eba\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u7206\u70b8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53bb\u5e74\u590f\u5929\u6297\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u5b89\u5168\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5174\u8da3\u3002\n \u5de5\u4f1a\u5316\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff06\uff0339;\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8270\u96be\u7684\u6218\u6597\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u81ea1994\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u8bbe\u6cd5\u5f00\u9664\u4e3b\u8981\u52b3\u5de5\u5de5\u4f1a\u3002\u5de5\u4f1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff06\uff0339;\u6b27\u6d32\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bbe\u65bd\u6210\u529f\u5f62\u6210\u6216\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f1a\u3002\n  \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u53cd\u590d\u4e3a\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u706b\u707e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u4f24\u5bb3\u7387\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u4ea4\u4ed8\u53f8\u673a\u4e5f\u6709\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;

the Teamsters plan to create a special Amazon division within its ranks that will fund and assist workers with organizing, according to a copy of the resolution, which was previously reported by  Vice. The resolution is expected to pass.\n Amazon declined to comment. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  recently acknowledged the company needed to do better by employees moving forward.\n The vote comes just a few months after a failed effort to unionize one of Amazon&#39;s warehouses in Alabama. In April, workers at Amazon&#39;s Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse  voted overwhelmingly\u00a0against unionization, with fewer than 30% of the votes tallied in favor of joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.\n Amazon has long been a target of major labor unions, with the Teamsters, the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union and the RWDSU quietly\u00a0 meeting with\u00a0warehouse and delivery workers. The\u00a0 coronavirus pandemic, the explosion of Black Lives Matter protests last summer and rising concerns around workplace safety fueled further interest in organizing Amazon warehouses.\n Unionizing Amazon&#39;s workforce would be an uphill battle. The company has\u00a0 managed to head off\u00a0major labor unions since its founding in 1994. Labor unions have organized some of Amazon&#39;s European workforce, but no U.S. facility has successfully formed or joined a union.\n  Amazon has repeatedly come under fire  for its working conditions, including its  injury rates and  productivity requirements.

This code is several years old and has not been maintained. I am releasing it into the public domain as several people have asked for it and it might help somebody in some small way. The code is probably quite messy, may contain poorly spelt or offensive comments and should not in any way be considered &#39;good code&#39;. Hey, I was a kid when I wrote most of this! I haven&#39;t had time to really go through everything and check for obvious mistakes as I am quite busywriting the new version of clayworks, working at  www.aicube.com and generally doing stuff.The source is mostly in Pascal but there are some smatterings of 80386 assembler in there too.To compile this code and run clayworks you need to have Borland Pascal 6 or greater. Set your outputand unit directory to the &#39;bin&#39; sub directory found in the zip file (if unzipping this file using dos pkunzip, using the -d switch to preserve the directory structure). In side that directory, thereare several files essential to clayworks including a few internal text files, a pcx image and In preparing this source, I have simply isolated the Pascal files needed by clayworks from all the other Pascal sources inside my aging Pascal directory. Some files may still be extraneous but I haven&#39;t looked through well enough to determine which ones are and which ones are not. All of the core UI code is contained in the files &#39;views.pas&#39;,&#39;tdwin.pas&#39;, &#39;gadgets.pas&#39; and &#39;dialogs.pas&#39;.The rendering code is contained in the files &#39;vga16.pas&#39;,&#39;vga256.pas&#39; and &#39;xvga256.pas&#39; although only &#39;vga16.pas&#39; is used in clayworks (4bit colour mode). I&#39;m not sure how up to data the other units are, perhaps you could get them working. I remember I did have clayworks running at 640x400 with 8bit colour on a standard vga card using the modex library but that was some time ago and not all monitors would sync to the weird rate that the mode required. Lower modes such as 320x240x256 should sync ok. However, I take no responsibility for any damage you might do to your monitor (or yourself) if you decide to use that library.Synopsis of files:BASIC3D.PAS :Basic 3d definitionsBITMAP16.PAS :Code for drawing on 4bit bitmapsBITMAP25.PAS :Code for drawing on 8bit bitmaps (n.b. almost exactly the same as vga256.pas)CHARDEF.PAS :Font structures and definitionsCLAYCP.PAS :Main clayworks source fileCOLOUR.PAS :Colour palette manipulation; gradients, colour matching and rgb&lt;-&gt;hsv convertionCPUTYPE.PAS :CPU identification (n.b from the dark ages, don&#39;t expect it to identify your itanium!)CRT2.PAS :Bare bones replacement for the buggy Borland crt.tpu unit (runtime error 200)DIALOGS.PAS :Dialog boxes structures and code (file, colour picker etc)DISKOP.PAS :Some disk io helper functionsDMA.PAS :DMA transfer.

However, if you wish to release a new version ofclayworks based on this source code, you must contact me first so that we can discuss how this shouldbe done. The main purpose of releasing the source is to help people understand what goes into a simple3d modelling program, rather than to start a big GPL thing. Besides, who codes in Pascal these days? I hope you find this useful, I recommend looking at the UI code as it&#39;s probably the most advanced thing in here (I used this as a base for the rewrite of clayworks also, although It&#39;s evolved greatly over the years).Finally, I reserve the right to the name &#39;Clayworks&#39; and do not accept liability for any damages incurred through using this source.Tim Lewis.Tokyo, 31/8/2000.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:51:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,clayworks,source,warning", "title": "CLAYWorks 2.45\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801 ", "title_en": "Clayworks 2.45 Source Code", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/timluther/clayworks_2.45", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u7801", "clayworks", "source", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067577, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b50\u7c7b\u548c\u7ec4\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0e\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e00\u6837\u53e4\u8001\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Go\u6216Rust\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u60a8\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4f46\u5177\u4f53\u600e\u6837\uff1f\n \u4efb\u4f55\u8ddf\u968f\u6211\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u8db3\u4ee5\u8ba9\u6211\u575a\u6301\u5728\u6784\u6210\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ee7\u627f\u8425\u5730\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0cPython\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u4ee5\u67d0\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f16\u5199\u60ef\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5f53\u65f6\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c1\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u601d\u8003\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u6211\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u535a\u6587\u5f88\u957f\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u62112006\u5e74\u8bba\u6587\u81ea\u4e0a\u6587\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u6700\u957f\u7684\u6563\u6587\u3002\u5ba2\u89c2\u5730\uff0c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u6210\u81f3\u5c11\u4e09\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\uff08SEO\uff01\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\uff01\u70b9\u51fb\uff01\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u8bfb\u5230\u5c3d\u5934\u3002\n \u4f46\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u5b83\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u5b83\u6210\u4e3a\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u7cbe\u534e\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u610f\u670d\u7528\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u4f11\u606f -

", "note_en": "The conflict between subclassing and composition is as old as object-oriented programming. The latest crop of languages like  Go or  Rust prove that you don\u2019t  need subclassing to successfully write code. But what\u2019s a  pragmatic approach to subclassing in Python, specifically?\n Anybody who follows me long enough knows that I\u2019m firmly in the  composition-over-inheritance camp. However,  Python is designed in a way that you  can\u2019t write idiomatic code without subclassing  sometimes. My goal for this article is to meditate on the question when that  sometimes is and untangle my gut feelings on the topic  1.\n I realize this blog post is  long. In fact, it\u2019s the longest piece of prose I\u2019ve written since my thesis in 2006. Objectively, I should\u2019ve split it up into  at least three parts. It would be better for engagement ( SEO!  Social media! Clicks!) and it would make it more likely that people  actually read it to the end.\n But I want it to stand for itself. I want it to be a distilled essence of what I\u2019ve learned over the years. Of course,  you can feel free to take as many breaks as you like \u2013 this article isn\u2019t going anywhere!\n But please do me the courtesy of holding back angry comments until reading it in its  entirety. No matter what your allegiance is, I hope you\u2019ll be able to read it with an open mind.\n Let\u2019s start with  nuance. One of the reasons why many discussion on subclassing are so frustratingly fruitless is that there isn\u2019t just one type of inheritance. As the wonderful article   Why inheritance never made any sense explains  2,  there are  three types that should never be mixed \u2013 no matter how you feel about subclassing in general.\n That makes it possible that three people argue against each other, each one being right in their own way, never finding common ground. We\u2019ve all seen these discussions unfold.\n In my experience \u2013 if used strictly separately \u2013 one is good, one is optional but useful, and one is bad. Most problems with subclassing stem from the fact that we try to use more than one type of subclassing at once \u2013 or from focusing the object design on the bad type.\n In all cases  you sacrifice reading convenience for writing convenience. That is not necessarily  bad, because software design is all about trade-offs and you can come to the conclusion that it\u2019s perfectly worth it in certain cases. This is why  I  don\u2019t expect you to agree with everything that follows. But I hope to provoke some thoughts that will help you to make that decision in the future.\n But now, without further ado, let\u2019s look at the three types. Starting with the bad one.\n   Most criticism of subclassing comes from code sharing and rightfully so. I don\u2019t feel that I have a lot to add to it, so instead I\u2019m going to link to exceptional prior art by people far smarter and more eloquent than me:\n   Variation over more than one axis. This is the major practical takeaway from Brandon\u2019s post and the second half of Sandi\u2019s talk. It\u2019s not easily explained so I\u2019ll refer to their works, but the essence is: if you want to customize more than one behavioral aspect of a class, code sharing via subclassing won\u2019t work. It leads to a   subclass explosion.\n Class and instance namespaces get muddled. If you\u2019ve got an attribute  self.x in a class that inherits from one or more base classes, it takes research and mental energy to find out where  x is coming from. This is true while  reading code and this is also true while  debugging.\n It also means that there\u2019s always the danger of two classes in the same hierarchy \u2013 that don\u2019t know about each other \u2013 trying to have an attribute with the same name. Python has the concept of the double underscore prefix ( __x) to deal with this scenario, but that has been frowned upon and argued to prefer principle of  consenting adults.\n The problem is that  informed consent is impossible if all parties aren\u2019t informed. This problem gets exponentially worse with multiple inheritance and its extreme form of  mixins. You\u2019re relying on classes \u2013 that you potentially don\u2019t control and that know nothing about each other \u2013 getting along in a  shared namespace.\n Another problem is that you have  no control over the methods and attributes that  you expose from the base classes to  your users. They are just there, tarnishing your API surface. Potentially changing over time as your base classes evolve and add or rename methods and attributes. This is among the reason why   attrs (and ultimately  dataclasses) chose to use  class decorators instead of subclassing: you have to be deliberate in what you attach to a class. It\u2019s impossible to accidentally leak something to all subclasses.\n Confusing indirections. This is a special case of the previous problem and the main point of Augie\u2019s and Nathaniel\u2019s talk. If every method is on  self, it\u2019s unclear where it\u2019s coming from when looking at the call. Unless you are  very careful, every attempt at understanding control flow ends in a  wild goose chase. Once multiple inheritance comes into play, you better read up on the  MRO and   super(). I think it\u2019s fair to say that something is amiss if  a question that boils down to \u201cwhat is  super() even for?\u201d gets almost 3,000 upvotes and more than 1,000 bookmarks on  StackOverflow.\n All of this gets extra problematic if you build APIs that require subclassing for either implementing or overwriting existing methods that get called from somewhere else. Both  Twisted and  asyncio have committed these sins in their  Protocol  3 classes respectively and it scarred me forever. The most common problems are that it\u2019s complicated to find out which methods exist (especially in deep hierarchies like   Twisted\u2019s) and the often silent failure if you name your method subtly wrong and the base class doesn\u2019t find it.  4\n \u201cAlso the subclassing based design was a huge mistake\u201d is probably the most-commonly uttered sentence in programming.\n\u2014 Cory Benfield (@Lukasaoz)  April 6, 2017\n  I use subclassing for code sharing only if I need to bend the behavior of a class  that I don\u2019t control. I consider it a less egregious type of   monkey patching. Usually it\u2019s better to write an   Adapter,   Facade,   Proxy, or   Decorator, but there are cases where the amount of methods that you\u2019d need to delegate make that cumbersome if you want to change only a small detail  5.\n   Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are mainly for  tightening interface contracts. You want to be able to say that you want an object with certain properties (attributes, methods) and don\u2019t care about the rest. In many languages they are called  interfaces which sounds a lot less pretentious, which is why I will be using that term from now on.\n Since Python is dynamically typed and type annotations are strictly optional, you  don\u2019t need formal interfaces. However, having a way to explicitly define an interface that you require for a piece of code to function is very useful. And since the advent of type checkers like   Mypy, they\u2019ve become   verified API documentation, which I find wonderful.\n For example, if you want to write a function that receives objects with a  read() method, you would somehow define an interface  Reader that has that method (the  how will be explained in a minute) and use it like this:\n  Your  printer() function doesn\u2019t care what  read() is doing as long as it returns a string it can print. It can return a pre-defined string, read a file, or make a web API call.  printer() doesn\u2019t care and your type checker will yell at you if you try to call any other method than  read() on it.\n   Abstract base classes (ABCs) are a less powerful version of   zope.interface and work using  nominal subtyping. They have been around since Python 2.6 and the standard library is  full of them.\n Please note that not every abstract base class is also an abstract data type. Sometimes it\u2019s just an  incomplete class that you\u2019re supposed to complete by subclassing it and implementing its abstract methods \u2013 not an interface. The distinction is not always 100% clear though.\n Protocols avoid subclassing by using  structural subtyping. They have been added in Python 3.8, but   typing-extensions make them available as far back as Python 3.5.\n Nominal subtyping and  structural subtyping are big words, but fortunately they are straightforward to explain.\n  Nominal subtyping means you have to  tell the type system that your class is a subtype of an interface definition. ABCs usually do that via subclassing but you can use the   register() method too.\n This is how you would define the  Reader interface from the introduction and mark  FooReader and  BarReader as implementations of it:\n import  abc class  Reader ( metaclass = abc . ABCMeta ):  @abc . abstractmethod  def  read ( self )  -&gt;  str :  ... class  FooReader ( Reader ):  def  read ( self )  -&gt;  str :  return  &#34;foo&#34; class  BarReader :  def  read ( self )  -&gt;  str :  return  &#34;bar&#34; Reader . register ( BarReader ) assert  isinstance ( FooReader (),  Reader ) assert  isinstance ( BarReader (),  Reader )\n If  FooReader didn\u2019t have a method called read, instantiation would fail  at runtime. If you use the  register() route as with  BarReader, the interface is  not verified at runtime and it becomes a (as the docs call it) \u201cvirtual subclass\u201d. This gives you the freedom to use more dynamic \u2013 or magical \u2013 means to provide the desired interface. Since  register() takes the implementing object as its argument, you can use it as a class decorator and save yourself two empty lines.\n In nominal subtyping, multiple inheritance is not only accepted but  encouraged, because ideally no methods, no behaviors, are being inherited and hopelessly intermixed \u2013 only class identities are being compounded. A class can implement many different interfaces and the smaller an interface, the better.\n  One \u201cupside\u201d of using ABCs to define interfaces is that by subclassing them, you can smuggle in code sharing by adding regular methods to your abstract base class. But as mentioned at the beginning:  mixing subclassing types is a bad idea. Code sharing is a bad idea. Multiple inheritance makes it an extra bad idea. To be fair, I have seen good uses of this pattern, but you have to be very judicious with your approach.\n  Structural subtyping is  duck typing for types: if your class fulfills the constraints of a   Protocol, it is  automatically considered a subtype of it. Therefore, a class can implement  many  Protocols from all kinds of packages without knowing about them!\n By default, this only works with type checkers, but if you apply   typing.runtime_checkable(), you can also perform  isinstance() checks against them.\n  from  typing  import  Protocol ,  runtime_checkable @runtime_checkable class  Reader ( Protocol ):  def  read ( self )  -&gt;  str :  ... class  FooReader :  def  read ( self )  -&gt;  str :  return  &#34;foo&#34; assert  isinstance ( FooReader (),  Reader )\n As you can see:  FooReader doesn\u2019t know that the  Reader protocol exists at all!\n  What I  really like about  Protocols is how it allows me to define what interface I  need completely non-intrusively and that definition can live along with the  consumer of the interface. That\u2019s great when you have different implementations of the same interface in the same code base. For example you could have an interface  MailSender that sends an e-mail in production but just prints it to the console in development  6.\n Or if you only use a small subset of a third-party class and want to be explicit which subset that is. This is great (verified!) documentation and helps when implementing fakes for your tests.\n For more details on  Protocols and  structural subtyping, check out  glyph\u2019s   I Want A New Duck.\n While this type of subclassing is  mostly harmless, you  don\u2019t need subclassing for abstract data types in Python thanks to  typing.Protocol and ABCs\u2019s  register() methods.\n  So we\u2019ve had one subclassing type that\u2019s harmful and one subclassing type that\u2019s unnecessary. Now we\u2019ve reached the good type. In fact, you can\u2019t get around this kind of inheritance in Python even if you wanted. Unless you want to stop using  Exceptions.\n Interestingly, specialization is often misunderstood. Intuitively it\u2019s easy: if we say that a class B specializes base class A, we say that class B is A with  additional properties. A dog is an animal. An A350 is a passenger airplane. They have all the properties of their base class(es) and  add attributes, methods, or just a place in a hierarchy  7.\n Despite this alluring simplicity, it\u2019s often used incorrectly. The most notorious mistake is saying that a square is a specialization of a rectangle, because geometrically, it  is a special case. However,  a square is not a rectangle  plus more.\n You can\u2019t use a square everywhere where you can use a rectangle, unless the code  knows that it has to expect a square too  8. If you can\u2019t interact with an object as if it\u2019s an instance of its base class, you\u2019re violating the   Liskov substitution principle  9 and you can\u2019t write  polymorphic code.\n If you look closely, you realize that interfaces from the previous section are a special case of specialization. You always specialize an generic API contract into something  concrete! The key difference is that abstract data types are\u2026well\u2026abstract.\n  I find specialization extremely useful when I\u2019m trying to represent  data that is strictly hierarchical.\n For instance, imagine you want to represent e-mail accounts as classes. They all share some data like their ID in the database and the address, but then \u2013 depending on the type of the account \u2013 they (can) have additional attributes. Importantly, these added attributes and methods change little to nothing of the existing ones. For example, a mailbox that stores e-mails on the server needs login information in form of a password hash. An account that accepts e-mails and only forwards them to an another e-mail address does not  10.\n    class  Mailbox :  id :  UUID  addr :  str  pwd :  str class  Forwarder :  id :  UUID  addr :  str  targets :  list [ str ]\n The address type is encoded in the class and each class has only the fields it uses. And if your model is this simple, this would  absolutely be the way to go. Any attempts at de-duplication only make sense if you have  many more fields and more types.\n Any method that you\u2019d add to either class would be completely independent from the other \u2013 leaving no room for confusion. You can also use these classes with a type checker using the  Union type:  Mailbox | Forwarder.\n  Usually it\u2019s a good idea to start with this approach  in any case because   duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction. Seeing all possible fields in front of you makes further design decisions a lot easier.\n   This is a design that you might end up with when you try to avoid inheritance at all cost, but still avoid repeating yourself:\n class  AddrType ( enum . Enum ):  MAILBOX  =  &#34;mailbox&#34;  FORWARDER  =  &#34;forwarder&#34; class  EmailAddr :  type :  AddrType  id :  UUID  addr :  str  # Only useful if type == AddrType.MAILBOX  pwd :  str  |  None  # Only useful if type == AddrType.FORWARDER  target :  list [ str ]  |  None\n Technically, this is more  DRY, but it makes the  usage of the instances of the class a lot more awkward. The type/existence of most fields entirely depend on the value of the  type field, which only exists because all address types share the same class type.\n It contradicts my favorite design principle to make  illegal state unrepresentable and is impossible to sensibly check using a type checker, which would complain about accessing  None-able fields all the time.\n The fact that all behavior working on this class would be lumped together leads to a lot of conditions ( if- elif- else statements) that increase the complexity of your code significantly. The whole point of polymorphism is to avoid that.\n Having optional attributes  11  is potentially a red flag. Having fields that need a  comment to explain  when to use them is a  May Day Rally. As controversial type annotations are, in this case they clearly point out to you that there\u2019s a problem with your models. Without them, you\u2019d have to notice that your code is more complex than it should be, which isn\u2019t as straight-forward.\n  You can make the situation a bit less painful and move mailbox-specific data into a class and make just  that field optional. It\u2019s better but still unnecessarily clunky.\n  This approach inverts the last one and looks silly with our overly simplistic data model, but let\u2019s just pretend that  EmailAddr has many more fields such that it\u2019s worth being wrapped into an own class:\n class  EmailAddr :  id :  UUID  addr :  str class  Mailbox :  email :  EmailAddr  pwd :  str  class  Forwarder :  email :  EmailAddr  targets :  list [ str ]\n This approach is not that bad! We\u2019ve got no optional fields and all data relationships are clear. As readability and clarity goes, there\u2019s nothing to complain about.\n Except that it\u2019s also very clunky and you don\u2019t need to consult Guido to realize that it\u2019s everything but Pythonic. So why does it look so contrived, although composition is supposed to be better than inheritance?  EmailAddr and  Mailbox/ Forwarder are  too closely related \u2013 it\u2019s even awkward to name the field to store it. Composition isn\u2019t failing us, but  in this case forcing an has-a relationship feels like going against the grain.\n But it\u2019s useful to show us something about our models: they all have common base information and are closely related. So let\u2019s go the final step and use Python\u2019s way of sharing a common base and use specialization by subclassing. We will come back to composition when I improve the design of a subclassing-based design in a later section of this article.\n  Finally, the approach that\u2019s in my opinion most ergonomic, DRY, obvious, and feasible to type check:\n  Whenever you have a  Mailbox, you  know you have a  pwd field \u2013 and so do your type checkers. The type is encoded in the class, so you don\u2019t have to repeat it in a field. A  Mailbox strictly  is an  EmailAddr  plus more.\n As for code, you now have to be aware of the  rules of responsible subclassing like the aforementioned   Liskov substitution principle. This  is additional complexity and mental overhead, but the boundaries and responsibilities are much clearer.\n Reading clarity suffers as with all kinds of subclassing, because you have to assemble the final class in your head to know what fields exist. But effectively you get the same classes like in the first approach. As long as you don\u2019t overdo it and ideally keep the definitions physically close to each other, it\u2019s the best trade-off in situations like this.\n It\u2019s so useful that I\u2019ve  used it in my  parsing library for PEM files and have yet to regret it.\n  A general advice to derive from this section is to always focus on the  shape of your data  first and only  then what to do with it.\n Once you have the shape nailed down, the behavior comes much more naturally. A good example of that is the   Sans I/O movement that is unequivocally  data first, since the behavior is supposed to be replaceable  by design.\n As long as you avoid cross-hierarchy interactions between methods while specializing, you should be fine. But always ask yourself if a  function wouldn\u2019t be enough \u2013  especially if you\u2019re coordinating work between two or more classes and there\u2019s no polymorphism to take advantage of. If you can\u2019t decide what class a method belongs to, the answer is often  neither.\n Finally make sure to learn about   @singledispatch; it will feel like magic if you haven\u2019t yet.\n   The last approach is so useful that it sneaked into we-don\u2019t-subclass  Go under the moniker of   embedding:\n  Instances of  Mailbox now have an attribute  addr as if it was defined within it:  https://play.golang.org/p/WSjJA6MYUDb. But you still have to be explicit  when initializing and there\u2019s no actual  hierarchy.

And what makes Vitalik Buterin think this is a &#34;Bitcoin only&#34; issue?\n Instead, some have already labeled it as the  Lehman Brothers of crypto, with the potential to send crypto to a glacial age, that might prevent its further adoption for a decade (in the best case scenario) or just make the whole crypto universe collapse on itself forever (what Nassim Nicholas Taleb has warned many times as the &#34; absorbing barrier&#34; or a point of no return!).\n In Lehman Brothers&#39; case, the paradox of centralization is that it eventually prevented a systemic collapse. Indeed, central players like the Fed and the government  bailed out the system (with the bailout of AIG first, and then with the Troubled Asset Relief Program which pumped back $700 billion in liquidity into the system).\n In the crypto space, without a last-resort authority in charge of preventing systemic risks, as everything is going awry, can this just mark the end of it all?\n I believe it&#39;s critical to answer these questions, to make sure we continue to see the blockchain and crypto ecosystem grow and really become the Web 3.0 we all dream of. And yet, to make this happen we need to make clarity on the short-term existential threats existing right now.\n And beyond all the scammy projects, buzz, and cultism going on in crypto, Tether is the most dangerous one, because it&#39;s sold as the &#34;real thing&#34; potentially masqueraded as the greatest Ponzi Schemes of all times.\n   As Bitcoin had gained traction over the 2010s, the idea of enabling other tokens to be built on top of Bitcoin&#39;s protocol took off (indeed, this was also the original idea of Ethereum in 2014).\n This gave rise to the Mastercoin project. The vision was to solve two of the most important barriers to Bitcoin mass adoption: Insecurity and instability (as highlighted in this  Coindesk piece).\n Mastercoin, therefore, has been  credited by some as &#39;inventing the ICO&#39; space.  Mastercoin would be rebranded as Omni by 2015.\n The rebranded Omni Protocol would serve as the foundation for Tether, which got built on top of this protocol (Tether was also an ERC20 token - built on top of Ethereum&#39;s blockchain protocol). At the same time, Tether initially was called &#34;Realcoin&#34; and only later on (by 2014) renamed Tether.\n As explained on its  website, nowadays  &#34;Tether tokens exist\u00a0as digital tokens built on bitcoin (Omni and Liquid Protocol), Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, SLP and OMG\u00a0blockchains.&#34;\n And as further explained  &#34;Tether Platform currencies are 100% backed by Tether\u2019s reserves. Tether tokens are redeemable and exchangeable pursuant to Tether Limited\u2019s terms of service. The conversion rate is 1 Tether USD\u20ae token (USD\u20ae) equals 1 USD.&#34;\n Tether had since the start a clear mission, that of facilitating the exchanges across digital currencies, by providing what&#39;s called a stablecoin. A stablecoin itself is a digital currency pegged to an underlying asset. In Tether&#39;s case that is the US dollar.\n Thus, by pegging the Tether to the dollar, whoever is converting its cryptocurrencies back to a stablecoin has the advantage of being able to trade back across various digital assets. They would be able to do so without having to incur wild price swings, which are intrinsic to the crypto world.\n  As liquidity providers, those are as good as those exchanges accept them as liquidity reserves.\n There are dozens of stablecoins and yet the top three (Tether, USD Coin and Binance USD)  almost reach a hundred billion market cap as of the time of this writing.\n And the most interesting part is that those stablecoins for better or for worse have become so popular that at this point there isn&#39;t really a conversion between Bitcoin and USD, rather the convention between Bitcoin to USDT (short for Tether) has become widely adopted.\n This implication is critical because it means that Bitcoin liquidity does not exist in fiat currency (to say you can&#39;t really convert all the existing Bitcoins back to dollars - at least not those that are going through central exchanges). This again poses a serious systemic risk, as in the short-term, if a good chunk of USDT would be exchanged back for dollars, it might be easy to imagine a massive liquidity drought.\n In fact, while some might say, &#34;you know Tether is only over $60 billion in market cap when Bitcoin is over $600 billion&#34; (at the time of this writing). But this reasoning doesn&#39;t make any sense. Because if a crisis of liquidity happens this would drag down the price of Bitcoin (and all the other cryptocurrencies) to the point that we don&#39;t know what would happen next.\n  What prompted in the first place this massive adoption of stablecoins, and  in primis of Tether?\n I mean why do people use stablecoins when they can simply trade back in dollars? There are various reasons for this phenomenon. However, incentives from central exchange platforms have widely pushed the adoption of stablecoins.\n One of the features that made stablecoins a good thing to have is the reduced intermediation fees to trade them.\n A second, killing feature that made stablecoins the go-to digital currency for investors is the fact that some central exchanges only accept them in the first place. As highlighted in the paper &#34; What Keeps Stablecoins Stable?&#34; Crypto exchanges like Binance and Poloniex, already in 2019, only accepted stablecoins as a medium of exchange.\n This means that &#34;liquidity&#34; across these exchanges is mediated by stablecoins (this implication is critical because it makes us redefine what liquidity means on those exchanges, and how this can be pumped up easily).\n This brings us back to a central issue for Tether. As the core assumption is that in case of a mass liquidation Tether would still be able to redeem it and yet maintain the peg with the dollar. Here the problem instead is that not only this peg would not be maintained.\n But worse of all, in case of a flight to liquidity it might create a massive negative domino effect on the whole crypto ecosystem.\n   Running a Central Exchange has been - paradoxically - one of the first viable business models on top of Bitcoin. That&#39;s a paradox because as the say goes &#34;Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins&#34; would imply that you don&#39;t need anyone holding the key for you.\n And yet &#34;we hold your key&#34; has been the main business model for successful exchanges like Coinbase. And many hard-earned lessons have been learned by the crypto community in the last decade as various central exchanges went bust (the epitome of that has been Mt. Gox bankruptcy back in 2014).\n So why did this central exchange business model work? Well, because it enabled a wider and wider number of people to join in. They could join without having to worry about wallets, storage, and more intricacies that make the crypto world still very hard to understand.\n You jump on a platform like Coinbase, with a great UX, a gamified section (the Earn platform enables you to start earning cryptocurrencies by answering a few simple questions) and you have the feeling to be already an expert.\n With the motto of &#34;you don&#39;t have to worry about your key&#34; central exchanges exponentially grew the user base, and with the increasing price of most cryptocurrencies, running a central exchange has become highly profitable.\n Perhaps,  in Q1 2021, a platform like Coinbase recorded an almost 10x increase in revenues from over $179 million to $1.59 billion.\n And the thing is, the whole central exchange business model is based on trading volume, as they make money mostly via fees.\n Central exchanges, therefore, have worked wonders in the crypto markets by easily expanding the user base.\n    A 2018 article, entitled &#34; Why Stablecoins Make No Sense&#34; called Tether a &#34;naive\u00a0stablecoin&#34; as it was not introduced as an independent currency. Instead, that is a sort of banknote or an &#34;I owe you&#34; or a promise of payment, that tells you that in case you want to exchange your USDT (Tether) back to dollars this will be easily backed.\n There is a problem here though, as what makes a banknote valuable is how much you can trust the bearer. And in the case of Tether, the bearer is a private company called Bitfinex.\n That is also why 2021 has become a key year in which Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) were needed. And among the most successful ones, Uniswap solved for liquidity - as  Decrypto highlighted -  &#34;by allowing the exchange to swap tokens without relying on buyers and sellers creating that liquidity.&#34; At this time also DEXs have some core issues (like so-called &#34; rug pulls&#34; one of the hardest problems to solve for a decentralized platform that isn&#39;t managed by any central player).\n In short, Central Exchanges solved for short-term liquidity (which is one of the greatest plagues of crypto) through stablecoins but - especially in the case of Tether - they create a plethora of other issues. The most fundamental one is that they only &#34;centralize the system&#34; by requiring investors to having to trust the bearer, thus killing the whole premise of a blockchain-based system.\n And things only get worse when the bearer is a private company, which lacks transparency.\n   Bitfinex is another central exchange that has become extremely popular (thanks to Tether) making it among the  top five central exchanges.\n This is owned and operated by\u00a0iFinex Inc., a company based in Hong Kong. While Tether is primarily issued by a company called  Tether Limited, owned by the same owners of Bitfinex.\n  Let&#39;s see some of the red flags that made this bearer very hard to trust.\n *Assuming that a &#34;blockchain economy&#34; can exist in the first place on these stablecoins backed by private companies with no regulation whatsoever. So the paradox here is that if we want a system driven by central exchanges and stablecoins regulation is a must!\n  Already in 2018 Bitfinex was alleged of hiding  $850 million in funds, masked as Tether reserves.\n  Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,\u201d\n  Tether\u2019s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie. These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system. This resolution makes clear that those trading virtual currencies in New York state who think they can avoid our laws cannot and will not. Last week, we sued to shut down Coinseed for its fraudulent conduct. This week, we\u2019re taking action to end Bitfinex and Tether\u2019s illegal activities in New York. These legal actions send a clear message that we will stand up to corporate greed whether it comes out of a traditional bank, a virtual currency trading platform, or any other type of financial institution.\n  Today\u2019s agreement requires Bitfinex and Tether to discontinue any trading activity with New Yorkers. In addition, these companies must submit regular reports to the OAG to ensure compliance with this prohibition.\n This case posed already some serious concerns about Tether as a stablecoin, and we were in a time where this whole thing could have been prevented, as the scale was still limited to less than a billion-dollar volume.\n An  article from NY Times, back in 2018, also claimed that back in 2017 the Bitcoin price was manipulated by Tether.\n Again, even only the suspect that this might be true is a serious concern for all the crypto space.\n  For the first time, in March 2021, Tether, which now became a mammoth, released for the first time:\n   While Tether claimed a cash reserve of 3.87%, it also claimed a giant commercial paper reserve which propelled it as a global giant, as the  Financial Times noticed.\n Therefore, the most worrying part of this report was the commercial paper backing, representing by large the most important backing for Tether.\n As  Coindesk has noted, commercial paper is  &#34;a form of corporate debt that can be easily converted to cash \u2013\u00a0   or not, depending on\u00a0   the issuer\u00a0and\u00a0   market conditions.&#34;\n As Coindesk further noted,  &#34;Tether declined to identify the borrowers of the loans or the collateral backing them.&#34;\n Thus, as far as we know, there are even more doubts and questions to be answered to this breakdown.\n  In a thread between  Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Paul Santos over Twitter, Paul Santos highlighted two very important points:\n 1. Price action of BTC is dictated by Tether trading pair: BTC/USDT, not BTC/USD. Look at the volume charts. Tether is BTC, even if you never trade for Tether.  2. Exchanges are fiat illiquid. They all shut down at the same time when their is a market crash to stop USD outflows.\n  If this turns out to be true, it means that, just like central banks, Tether is printing currency to pump short-term liquidity in the system (and help speculation), but behind it has a private company, of which we know little to nothing, if not the breakdown they recently provided!\n Imagine if the whole financial system was based on a person that told you &#34;I promise I can pay you back&#34; but showed you a wallet with plenty of toilet paper?\n  Central exchanges have become the primary enabler of the crypto-economy by expanding the user base of investors, with the motto of &#34;you don&#39;t have to worry about your key.&#34; As cryptocurrencies are still considered very risky by most banks, none or a few conventional banks want to do business with these exchanges. This led to a magic trick to solve the short-term liquidity issue these central exchanges face: stablecoins.\n In essence, stablecoins are the crypto version of banknotes where the trust is in the bearer to keep a stable peg between the digital currency and an underlying asset like let&#39;s say the dollar. And the popularity of these stablecoins depends on the willingness of the central exchange to accept them.\n Stablecoins turned out to be extremely successful in 2021 because they enabled investors to prevent higher intermediary fees. It gave them the ability to easily convert them into other digital currencies at any time. It also created a massive systemic risk. In short, a good chunk of the Bitcoin liquidity perhaps is tied to the Bitcoin/Tether peg. In short, if you want to convert a Bitcoin back to USD, you have to go through USDT (Tether) first. And if Tether is not backed by real USD there is no liquidity at all.\n Worse of all, if a flight to liquidity might happen this might make the whole crypto space insolvent. And without central authority potentially saving the system what will happen?\n  In case of a collapse of Tether what measures exist to prevent the whole system from collapsing?\n Answering these questions now makes the difference from having a crypto ecosystem destroyed or at least its long-term ability to drive change intact.\n Disclaimer:\u00a0 The opinions in this article belong to the author alone.

trailer from Warner Bros. for director James Gunn&#39;s forthcoming\u00a0  The Suicide Squad,\u00a0in which Courtney reprises his role as Captain Boomerang from 2016&#39;s   Suicide Squad. It&#39;s got quite bit of new footage and some small additional details (such as why Idris Elba&#39;s Bloodsport is in prison in the first place). Each of the three trailers released so far has been better than the last, so we have high hopes for this film.\n As  I&#39;ve written previously,\u00a0 The Suicide Squad is not a direct sequel to the 2016 film; Gunn has said he wanted to take the franchise in a new direction and introduce new characters. He drew inspiration from writer\u00a0 John Ostrander&#39;s original 1980s  Suicide Squad comics. (Ostrander has a small role in the final film.) Gunn  has described his R-rated film as a superhero version of the classic 1967 film\u00a0  The Dirty Dozen, selecting characters he described as &#34;loser, B-grade supervillains.&#34;\n  Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis reprise their 2016 roles as Col. Rick Flag and Intelligence Officer Amanda Waller, respectively, with Steve Agee playing John Economos, prison warden and aide to Waller. The squad this time around includes Elba&#39;s Bloodsport, Peacemaker (John Cena), Courtney&#39;s Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), King Shark (voiced by Rooker&#39;s   Cliffhanger co-star Sylvester Stallone), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Javelin (Flula Borg), and everyone&#39;s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).\n Other cast members include Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), whose trademark polka-dotted suit is actually a collection of gadgets; Weasel (Sean Gunn, James&#39; kid brother), an anthropomorphic weasel; Sol Soria (Alice Braga); TDK (Nathan Fillion); Mongal (Mayling Ng);\u00a0Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese); and Thinker (Peter Capaldi). Storm Reid plays\u00a0Bloodsport&#39;s daughter Tyla.\n Each of the prior trailers (released within a week of each other) had a very distinctive tone\u2014a deliberate choice by Gunn.\u00a0The  first was a red-band trailer (pretty tame as these things go) that played up the humor. It opened with a plan for Flag and his team to rescue Harley Quinn, who thwarted it by rescuing herself. Then there was some standard exposition to set up the basic story: namely, that the Suicide Squad members get the same deal as before: 10 years off their sentence if they successfully complete their mission, with a nanite injection that will explode should they disobey orders in any way.\n    The  second trailer, released on April Fool&#39;s Day, dispensed with the jokey tone and\u00a0running gags of King Shark&#39;s gruesome eating habits (&#34;num-num&#34;) in favor of a darker, more ominous tenor.\u00a0We got to see Polka-Dot Man in action, and TDK revealed a surprising ability to separate his arms from his body.\u00a0Bonus: we got a good look at the writing on the back of Harley Quinn&#39;s jacket: &#34;Live Fast Die Clown.&#34;\n This latest trailer falls somewhere between jokey and dark. It focuses more on Bloodsport, opening with him scrubbing floors in prison as Waller tries to recruit him for the squad. Waller uses Bloodsport&#39;s daughter&#39;s upcoming court case as leverage. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t take such extreme measures if this mission weren&#39;t more important that you could possibly imagine,&#34; Waller assures him. We also learn that Bloodsport is in prison because he put Superman in the ICU with the help of a kryptonite bullet, so he&#39;s got legit badass bona fides.\n In terms of new footage, we get an inter-squad debate over what kind of dog Weasel might be\u2014TDK guesses Afghan hound, Harley is hoping for werewolf\u2014with Flag assuring them Weasel is harmless. (&#34;I mean, he&#39;s not harmless, he&#39;s killed 27 children, but you know...&#34;) We also learn that our heroes&#39; mission is to destroy all evidence of the mysterious &#34;Project Starfish,&#34; which probably explains the colorful giant starfish-like  kaiju they end up battling.\n The Suicide Squad hits theaters and debuts on HBO Max on August 6, 2021. If you&#39;re fully vaccinated, I think this is one to see on the big screen, if you safely can. And expect to see more from this refreshed franchise in the future. HBO Max has already ordered a   Peacemaker spinoff straight-to-series, with Cena and Agee reprising their roles.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:11:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6f5c\u4f0f,grade,\u62d6\u8f66", "title": "\u201c\u5931\u8d25\u8005\uff0cB\u7ea7\u6f5c\u4f0f\u201d\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u6740\u5f0f\u961f\u62d6\u8f66 ", "title_en": "The \u201closer, B-grade supervillains\u201d are back in new The Suicide Squad trailer", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/the-loser-b-grade-supervillains-are-back-in-new-the-suicide-squad-trailer/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6f5c\u4f0f", "grade", "\u62d6\u8f66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "543d595393abce3de94c725937971ee6.jpeg", "infoid": 1067573, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u6709\u70b9\u7845\u8c37\u8fd0\u6c14\uff0c\u597d\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u7ec4\u7f51\u3002\n \u201c\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u4e0e\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u201d\u5c3c\u79d1\u5c14\u65af\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u57282011\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u642c\u5230\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6e7e\u533a\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u610f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5feb\u8fdb\u81f32016\u5e74\u3002\u5728\u6211\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u8de8\u6587\u5316[\u5192\u9669]\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u6295\u8d44\u5e7c\u513f\u62a4\u7406\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6b63\u5728\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u6211\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0cSuzy [Ryoo]\u5c31\u50cf\uff0c\u201c\u4f60\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7\u8fd9\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8Wonderschool\u90a3\u4e2aChris Bennett\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u50cf\uff0c\u201d\u5723\u6d01\u7684\u72d7\u5c4e\uff0c\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u514b\u91cc\u65af\u3002 '\u201c\n \u636e\u672c\u8d1d\u7eb3\u7279\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u5c3c\u79d1\u5c14\u65af\u5173\u4e8eFacebook Messenger\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u67d0\u4e9b\u76f4\u63a5\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5c3c\u79d1\u5c14\u65af\u8bf4\uff0cWonderschool\u6700\u7ec8\u662f\u4ea4\u53c9\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u9002\u5408\u3002\n  \u201c\u6211\u66fe\u7ecf\u6bcf\u5e74\u53bb\u6cf0\u5fb7\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u201d\u8d1d\u5185\u7279\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5973\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u5e7c\u513f\u6559\u80b2\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u91cd\u8981[...]\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u201d\u6211\u4eca\u5929\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u5c81\u4e4b\u524d\u79cd\u690d\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u79cd\u5b50\u3002\u201c\u6211\u60f3\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u72c2\u91ce\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u5f00\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ae5\u5e74\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8650\u5f85\u513f\u7ae5\u3002\u201c\n Bennett\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u70ab\u8000\u516c\u53f8\u65e9\u671f\u7532\u677f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7565\u5fae\u51fb\u6253\u3002\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u4e2d\u8df3\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u5c31\u662f\u8ba8\u8bba\u6240\u63a9\u65ad\u7684\u662f\uff1a\u84dd\u8272\u80cc\u666f\u4e0a\u7684\u767d\u8272\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7531\u5b50\u5f39\u70b9\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u95ea\u5149 - \u751a\u81f3\u662f\u56fe\u5f62 - \u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u3002\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8bda\u5b9e\u5730\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u7532\u677f\u7cfb\u5217\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u5927\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n \u201c\u5b83\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u5f53\u65f6\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u201d\u8d1d\u5185\u7279\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u83b7\u5f97\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u5408\u9002\uff0c\u5e76\u771f\u6b63\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e86\u89e3\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5efa\u9020\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u201c\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8eWonderschool\u8bbe\u6cd5\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u7b79\u96c6\u4e862000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Their partnership was a bit of Silicon Valley luck, good timing and some old fashioned networking.\n \u201cHe was a part of an organization that was helping to bring more diverse founders in touch with investors,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cThat was happening when I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2011. We started to build a casual relationship then. Fast forward to 2016. At my first fund, Cross Culture [Ventures], we were interested in investing in early childhood care. We were actually looking at a number of different companies and one of my partners, Suzy [Ryoo] was like, \u2018Have you heard of this company Wonderschool that Chris Bennett was starting, and I was like, \u2018Holy shit, I know Chris.\u2019 \u201d\n According to Bennet, Nichols reached out about the opportunity on Facebook Messenger. After the initial conversation and assessing some direct competitors, Nichols says Wonderschool was ultimately the right fit for Cross Culture\u2019s portfolio.\n  \u201cI used to go the TED conference every year,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cI met a woman who told me that early childhood education was really important [ \u2026 ] She said, \u2018A lot of the skills I use today as a CEO, a lot of those seeds were planted before the age of five.\u2019 I thought that was a really wild idea. I started doing research and realized there was a shortage of childcare in America.\u201d\n Bennett cringed slightly when we started the process of showing off the company\u2019s early deck. The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points.

months and it is still not finished!\n Our marketing created the campaign page themselves, because it takes IT forever to setup anything!\n Sounds familiar? I have been on both ends of these conversations, but mostly on the \u201cbeing yelled at\u201d end. For a long time, I was puzzled. Why was this happening?\n  You have a reasonable development team. Certainly expensive enough for your CFO to give you hard time. Despite that, things are still moving at snail&#39;s pace, at least according to your business users. Stuff is coming out of your pipeline, sure, but many good ideas, which could even be quickly developed, are killed, because no-one wants to wait until next quarter to test a simple business hypothesis.\n Many organizations adapt agile development methodologies with high hopes of solving this very issue. Often that fails miserably. What those Scrum certified consultants fail to mention is that Scrum optimizes for short term predictability, rather than throughput. Maybe Scrum has too many meetings for you, so you pick Kanban. Or rather what you think is Kanban, though it probably is not Kanban, but a single pile of tasks and a Jira board with few columns to go along with it. Result is more or less the same in both cases.\n Few companies even choose to go back to waterfall project management, because that at least gives them the illusion of long term predictability. It can definitely promise more than agile can deliver.\n  Too late in my career have I discovered  Kingman&#39;s formula. The formula originally appeared in an ancient math paper by J. F. C. Kingman in 1960 named \u201c The single server queue in heavy traffic&#34;. (Mind you, the server mentioned here is an actual person serving someone)\n   where  \u03c4 is the mean service time (i.e.  \\( \u03bc=\\frac{{1}}{{\u03c4}} \\) is the service rate),  \u03bb is the mean arrival rate,  \\( \u03c1=\\frac{{\u03bb}}{{\u03bc}} \\) is the utilization,  c a is the coefficient of variation for arrivals (that is the standard deviation of arrival times divided by the mean arrival time) and  c s is the coefficient of variation for service times.\n Understood? No? OK. I did not get it either at first, so let me explain. This formula, from the field of queueing theory, puts into relation the queue length (or in other words, how long does it actually take in real world days to develop anything here) with the following variables:\n variability in task size (are the tasks similar in size or some are small and some really big?)\n  utilization (what is the ratio between the entity performing the task is idle versus busy)\n You don&#39;t need to understand it completely in order to learn from it. The important takeaways are, that all three of the above increase the queue length. But they do so in a peculiar way with regards to the utilization. Under about 85% utilization, the variability does play a role, but not that big. Even with high variability, the work flows smoothly. But above 85% utilization the graph of queue length seems to explode exponentially. It becomes extremely sensitive to the two variabilities and above 95% the queue length starts quickly approaching infinity. Or it definitely feels that way to your users. Just ask them.\n Because the effect of high utilization is so large, much bigger than the influence of the two variabilities, the formula can be simplified and approximated as\n  If you plot it in a graph, it looks something like this. The graph is borrowed from The DevOps Handbook. Just notice how the wait time really takes off after hitting 85% utilization.\n    The variability of arrival rate is difficult to influence, as the tasks often originate outside of your control. There are still things you can do. To the outside world, IT looks like a opaque box, where you insert the tasks on one end and (sometimes) features come out the other end. The actual process however often involves multiple teams where the work is handed over and mini-queues also exist. Try to avoid batching of tasks in these internal handovers for more smooth workflow. And try to reduce the number of handovers by integrating more roles into a single team or eliminate the stages ruthlessly. Do you really need all those approval columns?\n Also, try to avoid big management planning sessions, where the board locks itself in a mountain resort for the weekend and creates a list of high priority projects for the following quarter. That does not help.\n  Task size is something we can influence more directly. If you take one thing from agile, it&#39;s the concept of User stories. If done right, a single user story should provide some value to some users and be ready to deploy within the two-week sprint. That means it should be small enough and uniform enough to help reduce the variability.\n Slicing user stories is an art in itself and would probably do for a separate article, but I will leave you with just one idea, that should help:  Try to solve a problem completely for a single class of users, however small that class is, rather than partially solve a problem for everyone.\n  The most important, but actually probably the simplest to influence, is the utilization of the team.  Just plan less work and give your team some slack. But simple does not mean easy. It&#39;s very counterintuitive. \u201cWhat do you mean, plan less work? How is that going to speed things up?\u201d Well, because science says so!\n But if science and beautiful math formulas fail to convince, you can reach for an example everyone should be able to understand. The analogy is not perfect, but works pretty well. I am talking of course about  traffic jams on the highway. I assume you have been in few. Have you noticed, how when the number of cars on the highway starts to increase, the speed you are driving goes down a bit? And then, it reaches some kind of seemingly illogical point, where suddenly everything comes to a screeching halt, even when there is no apparent reason like an accident or closure?\n Remember how the traffic experts keep telling you: \u201cIf there is a lot of traffic, slow down and avoid switching lanes to avoid causing a traffic jam?\u201d Well, that&#39;s because with a lot of traffic, the road has a  high utilization (ie. less space between cars). By switching lanes you are increasing the  variability of arrival (each segment of each lane works actually as a separate queue). By going fast, you are unable to keep driving a same constant speed like everyone else and thus increase the  variability of the duration of the task. You are constantly speeding up and slowing down. The task in this case means \u201cmoving one meter forward\u201d. Under high utilization, even slight increase in either of the two variabilities or the utilization itself has a huge effect on the queue size. The result: traffic jam.\n   You have to slow down to go faster. It&#39;s as simple as that. Aim for below 85% utilization. Same as we do not run our servers at 100% utilization, we should not run our teams at 100% utilization. If you do, expect your queues to approach \u221e.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:03:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5371\u9669,kingman,\u4efb\u52a1", "title": "\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5371\u9669 ", "title_en": "Ignore the Kingman at your own peril", "transed": 1, "url": "https://taborsky.cz/posts/2021/kingman-formula/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5371\u9669", "kingman", "\u4efb\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067569, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.\n  Saffron,  Crocus sativus (Iridaceae), is a perennial herb, which earned its popularity as both medicine and spice. It is an inhabitant of different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, and India. The benefits of saffron as an antidepressant are well-documented. Almost 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds are obtained from the chemical analysis of this plant. Fewer than 50 constituents elucidated and identified so far showed phytochemical characteristics. The major bioactive compounds identified are safranal, crocin, and picrocrocin, which are responsible for its aroma as well as its bitter taste. This review is an attempt to encompass the methods of analysis and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of saffron followed by its efficacious and safe potential.\n Crocus sativus L. belonging to Iridaceae family, commonly known as saffron, is a perennial herb widely cultivated in Iran and other countries, such as India and Greece. Commercial saffron is a spice comprises of dried red stigma with a small portion of the yellowish style attached to the flower of  Crocus sativus L., in Chinese its known as Fan-Hong-Hua. From decades saffron was used in traditional Chinese medicines for its expectorant, aphrodisiac, and antispasmodic effects.[ ] Saffron can be planted from an altitude of sea level to almost 2000 m, but it is more preferably adapted to hill sides and mountain valleys, ranging in altitudes between 600 and 1700 m.[ 2] Also, this plant can be cultivated in a dry and infertile place where there is an extreme water shortage in summer. The origin of the word saffron is the French term \u201cSafran,\u201d which was derived from the Latin word \u201csafranum\u201d and yellowish in color, phytochemical analysis have revealed that the color is mainly because of the degraded carotenoid compounds, crocin and crocetin.[ ] This is one of the valuable herb in the world because it requires properly plucked stigma from the flowers. Variation and high quality of final products are due to the harvest process involved.[ ]\n Saffron has been famous as both medicine and spice in some cultures. The stigma of saffron has been used as a medicine over 3600 years ago.[ ] Saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries).[ ] Also, saffron has been used in coloring tunics in the region of Spain and by the Babylonian culture around 2400 BC.[ 7] This expensive spice can be found in different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, or Kashmir.[ 7] Each of the flowers has three red-colored stigma, and one stigma of saffron weighs approximately 2 mg. Approximately 1 kg of this valuable spice is made from 150,000 flowers that must be carefully picked.[ ]\n One of the most established findings regarding the benefits of saffron is its antidepressant activity. There are clinical trials conducted, evaluating the efficacy of saffron in mild-to-moderate depression. The studies reported that saffron was more effective than placebo and at least equivalent to the therapeutic doses of imipramine and fluoxetine. One of the top five most predominant diseases worldwide is depression.[ ] Depression can affect the quality of life of someone because of the facts that it can cause a headache, difficulty in thinking, and loss of interest.\n Recently, approximately 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds have been detected from the chemical analysis of  C. sativus L. However, fewer than 50 constituents have been identified so far as the phytochemicals of  C. sativus L. The major constituents of saffron are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 9] The phytochemical agents in saffron are responsible for many pharmacological actions in the body. The phytochemical research has found that the color of saffron is mainly because of the degraded compound of carotenoids, which are crocin and crocetin.[ ] Many clinical studies focused more on the antidepressant effects of saffron.\n Saffron has intensive fragrant with slightly bitter taste and produces a bright yellow-orange solution when soaked in warm water.[ 10] Its stigma was shown to contain carbohydrates, minerals, mucilage, vitamins B1 and B2, and pigments. Crocin, crocetin, carotene, lycopene, and gigantic[ ] anthocyanin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin are the oil-soluble pigments that can be found in the stigma.[ 12] The color of saffron is the result of degradation of carotenoid compounds named crocin. According to Wallis,[ 13] crocin constituent of saffron, which highly related to its intense color, is the natural water-soluble carotenoid. Crocetin in  C. sativus L. is a water-insoluble conjugated polyene with two carboxylic acid residues.[ 14] Crocetin esters or also known as crocin, which is hydrophilic and water soluble, are usually found in the saffron extract in which \u03b1-crocin, the glycosyl ester of crocetin, is the main contributor for the significant bright yellow-orange color of saffron.[ 15] Saffron has a unique flavor that is related mainly to the glycoside picrocrocin.[ 16] Picrocrocin is responsible for the unique flavor of  C. sativus L., which is found to be stable in fresh raw saffron and broken down when heated to release.[ ] Specific essential oils of the flower contribute to the sweet fragrance of saffron. The principal constituent of total essential oil of  C. sativus L., safranal is a carboxaldehyde volatile compound formed by deglucosylation of picrocrocin.[ 16] Saffron is widely used in food processing industry as colorant and flavoring agents. The essential oils also comprised several terpene aldehydes, ketones, and terpene derivatives (pinene and cineol).[ 10] The secondary metabolites present in the petals of  C. sativus L. are tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, which include rutin, quercetin, luteolin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids. Those compounds have been reported to have many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory,[ ] antinociceptive,[ ] and blood pressure lowering effects.[ ]\n All  trans and  cis isomers of crocin reflect the characteristics of carotenoids by having ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectra highlighting double peaks between 400 and 500 nm in the visible region.[ 21] Safranal is responsible for aroma, whereas its precursor picrocrocin, which is a monoterpene glycoside, is accountable for the bitter taste of saffron.[ 21] The pattern of UV absorption of picrocrocin can be seen with a broad band at 250 nm with the maximum absorption of 254 nm, reflecting the presence of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated cycloaldehyde functional group in its molecular structure.[ 22] Picrocrocin underwent enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis to produce glucose and aglycone and then yielded safranal via dehydration during drying process.[ 22] Active components that indicate the quality and pharmacological studies of saffron are the enzymatic oxidative metabolites of glucoside derivative of zeaxanthin, which include  cis- and  trans-crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 23] The main phytochemicals that may contribute to the biological activities of  C. sativus L. are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.\n Crocin and saffron extract had been revealed to prevent memory and spatial learning impairment because of chronic-induced stress.[ ] Prophylactic property of saffron against memory deficiency had been proposed to occur as the result of the correlation between the antioxidant activity of saffron and the impairment because of oxidative stress.[ 21] Akhondzadeh  et al.,[ ] in 2004, had shown saffron extract to be equally efficient to imipramine during double-blind and randomized trial conducted over 6 weeks. The dried saffron petal also had been revealed to be effective in mild-to-moderate depression based on 6 weeks of double-blind randomized clinical trials.[ ] Crocin (30 mg/day), the main antioxidant constituent of saffron stigmas, was shown to amplify the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating patients with mild-to-moderate depression with the absence of substantial side effects based on the observation of 4 weeks of randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial with 40 patients of major depressive disorder.[ ] Scientifically proven traditional uses of saffron as antidepressant suggested that crocin exerts its antidepressant effect by increasing cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor inducible levels in rat hippocampus.[ ] Subacute administration of crocin was indicated to cause antidepressant effects in the rat. When saffron capsules administered to patients with a prior history of percutaneous coronary intervention who had depression, it was found to be equally effective as fluoxetine.[ ] In one of the 6-week pilot double-blind, randomized trial, the petal of the  C. sativus L. was found to be equally valid with the stigma in the treatment of depressed outpatients.[ 30] The petal constituent of  C. sativus L., kaempferol, was revealed to have antidepressant effect when evaluated using forced swimming test in mice and rats.[ 31] It has been perceived that current findings of biological activities of  C. sativus L., particularly its main constituent crocin, supported its medicinal used in traditional practices.\n According to Murray and Lopez,[ ] depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases and has been estimated to affect up to 21% of the world\u2019s population. Majority of patients are often reluctant to take synthetic antidepressant drugs in their appropriate doses because of the anticipated side effects such as the inability to drive a car, dry mouth, constipation, and libido.[ ] Hence, plant extracts are some of the most attractive sources of new drugs and have been shown to produce a better result with low side effects in the treatment of depression.[ ]\n C. sativus L. or commonly known as saffron is an expensive traditional spice. Its active components have shown several useful pharmacological effects such as anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, radical scavenger effects, and learning and memory-improving effects.[ ] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ 30] stated that saffron had been widely used to relieve stomachaches, ease the pain of kidney stones, and treat depression in Persian traditional medicine.\n According to Srivastava  et al.,[ ] two active ingredients of  C. sativus L., which are crocin and safranal, have shown antidepressant effects. This is in accordance to the study carried out by Hosseinzadeh  et al.,[ 35] regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of  C. sativus L. stigma and their constituents, safranal and crocin, for the antidepressant activity by using forced swimming test in mice. The result obtained shows that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stigma (0.2\u20130.8 g/kg), safranal (0.15\u20130.5 mL/kg), and crocin (50\u2013600 mg/kg) could reduce the immobility time of the mice and the swimming time increased greatly. It is suggested that the inhabitation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake by crocin and safranal might be the possible mechanism of antidepressive effect of saffron.[ 30] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ ] also conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of saffron with imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In another study, patients were assigned to receive capsule saffron (30 mg/day) three times a day (tds) or capsule imipramine (100 mg/day tds) for a 6-week research.[ ] The result showed that saffron at this dose was found to be effective comparable to imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression.\n Because the stigma of  C. sativus L. (saffron) is very expensive, the researchers use the leaves of this plant as it is cheaper and possesses antidepressant effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial performed by Srivastava  et al.,[ ] 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of the petal of  C. sativus L. at dose of (30 mg/day) twice daily (bd) and capsule of placebo twice daily (bd) for a 6-week study. At 6 weeks, the petal of  C. sativus L. produced a significantly better outcome on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale than placebo. Hence, it is proven that the petal of  C. sativus L. does give antidepressant effect. Karimi  et al.[ 36] also conducted a study regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stigma and petal of  C. sativus L. for the antidepressant activity according to the forced swimming test in mice. It was shown that both stigma and petal reduced immobility time of the mice. In a double-blind and randomized trial performed by Akhondzadeh Basti  et al.,[ ] patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of petal of  C. sativus L. (15 mg bid) (Group 1) and fluoxetine (10 mg bid) (Group 2) for an 8-week study. At the end of the trial, the petal of  C. sativus L. was found to be effective as similar to fluoxetine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In study by Melnyk  et al. (2010), kaempferol (the active constituent in saffron petals) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg in mice and 50 mg/kg in rat reduces depressive symptoms similar to fluoxetine.[ 37] Wang  et al.[ ] also conducted research regarding the antidepressant properties of stigmas and corms of  C. sativus L. The corms of  C. sativus L. were fractionated based on polarity and yielded petroleum ether fraction and dichloromethane fraction. At doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg, it showed significant antidepressant-like activities as the immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspending test was significantly reduced by these two fractions.\n Hausenblas  et al.[ ] stated that, similar to antidepressants, saffron may exert its antidepressant effect by modulating the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin (a mood-elevating neurotransmitter). Although it has been proposed that saffron increases serotonin levels in the brain, the exact mechanism of action for this is unknown. More specifically, a saffron extract might inhibit serotonin reuptake in synapses. Inhibiting synaptic serotonin reuptake keeps serotonin in the brain longer, thereby enhancing its positive effects while combating depression.\n Several analytical methods have been developed for the systematic separation and quantification of saffron ( C. sativus L.) metabolites.[ ] Several methodologies have been reported using different analytical tools to analyze the bioactive constituents of saffron, that is, picrocrocin, safranal, and crocin.[ , 40, 41, 42, 43] UV-vis spectrometry method is recommended by the International Standardization Organization to characterize the quality of saffron. The technique has been used for quality and stability studies of saffron, whereby the process is considered to be appropriate for recognizing the taste, color, and flavor of the spice (ISO/TS 3632, 2003). However, this method is not suitable for the identification and quantification of each component of saffron extract. This is because the technique is not specific and cannot adequately separate. Hence, because of mentioned reasons, the advanced stationary phases of analytical and preparative methods have been developed such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, multilayer coil counter current chromatography with silica gel, aluminum oxide, and Sephadex LH-20.[ 41, 42, 44, ]\n Tarantilis  et al.[ ] and Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] in their studies reported other analytical methods such as reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled together with mass spectrometry and photodiode array detector, and for the detection of volatile compounds, gas chromatography with mass spectrometer (MS).\n Most of the studies conducted have been focused on the analytical determination of the structure of crocin. However, the methods to isolate high-purity crocin have not been established.[ , 46] To obtain adequately pure crocin, the compound is first separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and then by preparative HPLC.[ 42] Through this method, crocin can only maximally be separated to seven fractions. The method also implies repeated procedures, which are time-consuming, before purified crocin can be isolated. A simple two-step method in which 20 fractions of crocin are separated simultaneously in the first step, and then high-purity pigment is obtained in a subsequent step has been reported by Zhang  et al.[ 46] The purity of the crocin compound was reported to be above 95%, whereby the methods used two-step, low-pressure liquid chromatography without preparative HPLC. Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] reported that isolation method namely micro-simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction and vacuum head space were more suitable to isolate the aroma components of saffron as compared to standard distillation method. Another method for the separation of crocin reported was crystallization, whereby the amount of obtained crocin from the first crystallization step was 17% of the stigma powder, but its purity was approximately 85%. The purity increased to more than 97% after a second crystallization step was performed. Therefore, the total amount of crocin obtained is 10% from the initial stigma powder of saffron.[ ]\n Other than the investigation of the biological activities of crocetin and crocin, it is also important to determine the pharmacokinetic aspects of the compounds such as its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. Until now, most of the studies were carried out using  in vitro and  in vivo animal model, which mainly focuses on the absorption and metabolism parameters. Also, the review of the pharmacokinetic profile of those compounds in human body remains inadequate. A study was conducted by Umigai  et al.[ ] on 10 healthy human volunteers with a single dose of crocetin orally administered at three doses (7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg) in the 1-week interval to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma crocetin by using RP-HPLC. They reported that crocetin was rapidly absorbed and detected in the plasma within 1h and reached a peak of mean maximum plasma concentration, C max (100.9\u2013279.7 ng/ml) around 4\u20134.8 h. The C max value was also reported to be increasing in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the mean elimination half-life of crocetin, T 1/2, in human plasma was also ranging from 6.1 to 7.5 h.[ ]\n In pharmacokinetic study, one of the factors affecting the bioavailability of a compound is its solubility and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. The research carried out by Xi  et al.[ ] using HPLC observed that crocin remained undetected in the serum of tested rats, regardless of gender, following single or repeated doses of oral administration. However, its hydrolysis product, crocetin, was found in low concentration in the serum. Crocin also was excreted mainly in feces. Besides, following repeated oral doses of crocin, no accumulation of crocetin was found in the serum.[ ] This suggests that crocin is hydrolyzed in the intestine into crocetin before being absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration. In detail, on the basis of  in vitro study, crocin was reported to get hydrolyzed into deglycosylated  trans-crocetin and subsequently, absorbed by passive transcellular diffusion to a high extent within short time interval through intestinal cells.[ ]\n However, a recent study by Zhang  et al.[ ] showed that orally administered crocin could be absorbed through gastrointestinal tract \n......",
