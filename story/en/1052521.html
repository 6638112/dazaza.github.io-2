The promise of a new processor core microarchitecture, updates to the connectivity and new security options while still retaining platform compatibility are a good measure of an enterprise platform update, but the One True Metric is platform performance. Seeing Zen 3 score ultimate per-core performance leadership in the consumer market back in November rose expectations for a similar slam-dunk in the enterprise market, and today we get to see those results.</p><p>AMD 3 RD GenerationCroper家族的到来，使用新的Zen 3核心进行了热烈预期。新的处理器核心微架构的承诺，对连接和新安全选项的更新，同时仍然保持平台兼容性是企业平台更新的好的衡量标准，但一个真正的度量是平台性能。在11月份，在消费市场中看到Zen 3分数终极性能领导，对企业市场上类似的猛击扣篮的预期，今天我们可以看到这些结果。</p><p>  The headline numbers that AMD is promoting with the new generation of hardware is an increase in raw performance throughput of +19%, due to enhancements with the new core design. On top of this, AMD has new security features, optimizations for different memory configurations, and updated performance with the Infinity Fabric and connectivity.</p><p>  AMD推广新一代硬件的标题号是原始性能吞吐量的增加+ 19％，因为具有新的核心设计的增强。在此之上，AMD具有新的安全功能，针对不同内存配置的优化，以及使用Infinity结构和连接的更新性能。</p><p>  Anyone looking for the shorthand specifications on the new EPYC 7003 series, known by its codename Milan, will see great familiarity with the previous generation, however this time around AMD is targeting several different design points.</p><p>  任何寻找新EPYC 7003系列的简写规范的人都会看到其代号米兰，将看到与前一代的熟悉，然而，AMD周围的这次是针对几个不同的设计点。</p><p> Milan processors will offer up to 64 cores and 128 threads, using AMD’s latest Zen 3 cores. The processor is designed with eight chiplets of eight cores each, similar to Rome, but this time all eight cores in the chiplet are connected, enabling an effective double L3 cache design for a lower overall cache latency structure. All processors will have 128 lanes of PCIe 4.0, eight channels of memory, with most models supporting dual processor connectivity, and new options for channel memory optimization are available. All Milan processors should be drop-in compatible with Rome series platforms with a firmware update.</p><p> 米兰处理器将提供多达64个核心和128个线程，使用AMD的最新Zen 3核心。处理器设计有八个核心八芯，类似于罗马，但这次连接小芯片中的所有八个核心，实现了用于较低总缓存延迟结构的有效的双L3缓存设计。所有处理器都将有128个PCIe 4.0，8个通道内存，大多数支持双处理器连接的模型，以及通道内存优化的新选项可用。所有米兰处理器都应该与具有固件更新的罗马系列平台兼容。</p><p>  One of the highlights here is that the new generation of processors will offer 280 W models to all customers – previous generations had only 240 W models for all and then 280 W for specific HPC customers, however this time around all customers can enable those high performance parts with the new core design.</p><p>  这里的一个亮点是，新一代的处理器将为所有客户提供280个型号，以前的一代人只有240 W型号，然后为特定的HPC客户提供280 W，但是这次所有客户都可以实现那些高性能零件具有新的核心设计。</p><p>   The new top processor for AMD is the EPYC 7763, a 64-core processor at 280 W TDP offering 2.45 GHz base frequency and 3.50 GHz boost frequency. AMD claims that this processor offers +106% performance in industry benchmarks compared to Intel’s best 2P 28-core processor, the Gold 6258R, and +17% over its previous generation 280 W version the 7H12.</p><p>   AMD的新顶级处理器是EPYC 7763，64核处理器，280 W TDP提供2.45 GHz基础频率和3.50 GHz升压频率。 AMD声称，与英特尔最佳的2P 28核处理器，黄金6258R，+ 17％在其上一代280W版本中，该处理器在工业基准中提供+ 106％的性能。</p><p>  One of AMD’s angles with the new Milan generation is going to be targeted performance metrics, with the company not simply going after ‘peak’ numbers, but also taking a wider view for customers that need high per-core performance as well, especially for software that is invariably per-core performance limited or licensed. With that in mind, AMD’s F-series of ‘fast’ processors is now being crystallized in the stack.</p><p>  AMD与新米兰一代的角度之一将是有针对性的性能指标，公司不仅仅是在'峰值'号之后，也对需要高度核心性能的客户来说，尤其是软件，对客户提供更广泛的观点这是总体核心表现有限或许可的。考虑到这一点，AMD的F系列的“快”处理器现在正在堆栈中结晶。 </p><p>  These processors have the peak single threaded values of anything else in AMD’s offering, along with the full 256 MB of L3 cache, and in our results get the best scores on a per-thread basis than anything else we’ve tested for enterprise across x86 and Arm – more details in the review. The F-series processors will come at a slight premium over the others.</p><p>这些处理器在AMD提供的其他任何内容中的峰值单线程值，以及L3缓存的完整256 MB，并且在我们的结果中，每个线程的基础上的最佳分数比我们在x86跨越企业测试的任何其他内容和ARM  - 更多详情述评。 F系列处理器将略微溢价。</p><p>    The first generation of EPYC was launched in June 2017. At that time, AMD was essentially a phoenix: rising from the ashes of its former Opteron business, and with a promise to return to high-performance compute with a new processor design philosophy.</p><p>    第一代EPYC于2017年6月推出。当时，AMD基本上是菲尼克斯：从其前Opteron业务的灰烬上升，并承诺与新的处理器设计哲学回归高性能计算。</p><p> At the time, the traditional enterprise customer base were not initially convinced – AMD’s last foray into the enterprise space with a new generation of paradigm-shifting processor core, while it had successes, fell flat as AMD had to stop itself from going bankrupt. Opteron customers were left with no updates in sight at the time, and to the willingness to jump on an unknown platform from a company that had stung so many in the past was not a positive prospect for many.</p><p> 当时，传统的企业客户群并没有最初说服 -  AMD的最后一个人进入企业空间，并通过新一代的范式转换处理器核心，而它已经成功，因为AMD不得不阻止破产。当时留下Opteron客户没有在视线上没有更新，并愿意从过去曾刺起的公司的未知平台愿意跳过，这不是许多人的积极前景。</p><p>  At the time, AMD put out a three year roadmap, detailing its next generations and the path the company would take to overcoming the 99% market share behemoth in performance and offerings. These were seen as lofty goals, and many sat back willing to watch others take the gamble.</p><p>  当时，AMD推出了三年的路线图，详细说明了它的下一代，该途径将克服99％的市场股权在绩效和产品中享有百叶派。这些被视为崇高的目标，很多人坐在愿意看别人赌博。</p><p>  As the first generation Naples was launched, it offered impressive some performance numbers. It didn’t quite compete in all areas, and as with any new platform, there were some teething issues to begin. AMD kept the initial cycle to a few of its key OEM partners, before slowly broadening out the ecosystem. Naples was the first platform to offer extensive PCIe 3.0 and lots of memory support, and the platform initially targeted those storage or PCIe heavy deployments.</p><p>  随着第一代那不勒斯推出，它提供了令人印象深刻的一些性能数字。它在所有领域并不相比竞争，与任何新平台一样，有一些出牙问题开始。 AMD在慢慢扩大生态系统之前，将初始循环保持在其一些关键的OEM合作伙伴。那不勒斯是提供广泛的PCIe 3.0和许多内存支持的第一个平台，并且该平台最初针对这些存储或PCIe重型部署。</p><p>  The second generation Rome, launched in August 2019 (+26 months) created a lot more fanfare. AMD’s newest Zen 2 core was competitive in the consumer space, and there were a number of key design changes in the SoC layout (such as moving to a NUMA flat design) that encouraged a number of skeptics to start to evaluate the platform. Such was the interest that AMD even told us that they had to be selective with which OEM platforms they were going to assist with before the official launch. Rome’s performance was good, and it scored a few high-profile supercomputer wins, but more importantly perhaps it showcased that AMD was able to execute on that roadmap back in June 2017.</p><p>  第二代罗马在2019年8月推出（+26个月）创造了更多的粉丝。 AMD的最新ZEN 2核心在消费者空间中具有竞争力，SOC布局有许多关键设计变化（例如移动到NUMA平面设计），鼓励许多怀疑论者开始评估平台。这样的兴趣甚至告诉我们他们必须选择他们在正式发布之前要协助的OEM平台。罗马的表现很好，它赢得了一些高调的超级计算机胜利，但更重要的是，也许它展示了AMD能够在2017年6月回到该路线图上。</p><p> That flat SoC architecture, along with the updated Zen 2 processor core (which actually borrowed elements from Zen 3) and PCIe 4.0, allowed AMD to start to compete on performance as well as simply IO, and AMD’s OEM partners have consistently been advertising Rome processors as compute platforms, often replacing two Intel 28-core processors for one AMD 64-core processor that also has higher memory support and more PCIe offerings. This also allows for compute density, and AMD was in a place where it could help drive software optimizations for its platform as well, extracting performance, but also moving to parity on the edge cases that its competitors were very optimized for. All the major hyperscalers also evaluated and deployed AMD-based offerings for their customers, as well as internally. AMD’s sticker of approval was pretty much there.</p><p> 该平面SOC架构以及更新的ZEN 2处理器核心（其实际从ZEN 3借用元素）和PCIe 4.0，允许AMD开始竞争性能以及IO简单地竞争IO，而AMD的OEM合作伙伴一直在广告罗马处理器作为计算平台，通常更换两个英特尔28核处理器的一个AMD 64核处理器，也具有更高的内存支持和更多PCIe产品。这也允许计算密度，并且AMD在一个地方可以帮助驱动其平台的软件优化，而且提取性能，也可以在边缘案例上移动其竞争对手的竞争者非常优化。所有主要的超值者还为客户以及内部进行了评估和部署了基于AMD的产品。 AMD的批准贴纸几乎在那里。 </p><p>  And so today AMD is continuing that tour of Italy with a trip to Milan, some +19 months after Rome. The underlying SoC layout is the same as Rome, but we have higher performance on the table, with additional security and more configuration options. The hyperscalers have already been getting the final hardware for six months for their deployments, and AMD is now in a position to help enable more OEM platforms at launch. Milan is drop-in compatible with Rome, which certainly helps, but with Milan covering more optimization points, AMD believes it is in a better position to target more of the market with high performance processors, and high per-core performance processors, than ever before.</p><p>因此，今天的AMD正在继续参观意大利与米兰的旅行，罗马几个+19个月。底层SoC布局与罗马相同，但我们在表格上具有更高的性能，具有额外的安全性和更多配置选项。过度高音界面已经为其部署获得了六个月的最终硬件，AMD现在可以帮助启动更多OEM平台。米兰与罗马兼容，罗马当然有助于，但与米兰覆盖更多优化点，AMD认为它具有更好的位置，以实现更多的市场，高性能处理器，高于每核性能处理器，而不是以往任何时候前。</p><p> AMD sees the launch of Milan as that third step in the roadmap that was shown back in June 2017, and validation on its ability to execute reliably for its customers but also offer above industry standard performance gains for its customers.</p><p> AMD在2017年6月展示的路线图中，米兰推出了米兰，并验证其可靠客户对客户执行的能力，而且还提供以上其客户的标准性能提升。</p><p> The next stop on the tour of Italy is Genoa, set to use AMD’s upcoming Zen 4 microarchitecture. AMD has also said that Zen 5 is in the pipeline.</p><p> 下一站式在意大利之旅是热那亚，设定使用AMD即将到来的Zen 4微架构。 AMD还表示，ZEN 5在管道中。</p><p>  AMD is launching this new generation of Milan processors approximately 19 months after the launch of Rome. In that time we have seen the launch of both Amazon Graviton2 and Ampere Altra, built on Arm’s Neoverse N1 family of cores.</p><p>  AMD在罗马推出后19个月推出了这一新一代米兰处理器。在那个时候，我们已经看到了Amazon Graviton2和Ampere Altra的推出，建于Arm的NeoVerse N1家族核心。</p><p>  From Intel, the company has divided its efforts between big socket and little socket configurations. For big sockets (4+) there is Cooper Lake, a Skylake derivative for select customers only. For smaller socket configurations (1-2), Intel is set to launch its 10nm Ice Lake portfolio at some point this year, but as yet it still remains silent on exact dates. To that end, all we have to compare Milan to is Intel’s Cascade Lake Xeon Scalable platform, which was the same platform we compared Rome to.</p><p>  来自英特尔，该公司在大套接字和小套接字配置之间努力。对于大插座（4+），有Cooper Lake，仅供选择客户的天窗衍生。对于较小的套接字配置（1-2），英特尔将在今年的某一点上启动其10nm Ice Lake Portfolio，但仍然对确切日期仍然保持沉默。为此，我们必须将米兰比较英特尔的级联湖Xeon可扩展平台，与我们比较罗马的平台是相同的平台。</p><p>   For this review, AMD gave us remote access to several identical servers with different processor configurations. We focused our efforts on the top-of-the-stack EPYC 7763, a 280 W 64-core processor, the EPYC 7713, a 225 W 64-core processor, and the EPYC 7F53, a 280 W 32-core processor designed as the halo Milan processor for per-core performance.</p><p>   对于此评论，AMD向我们远程访问具有不同处理器配置的多个相同的服务器。我们将我们的努力集中在堆叠的叠加ePYC 7763，280 W 64核处理器，EPYC 7713，225 W 64核处理器和EPYC 7F53，A 280 W 32核处理器设计为HALO MILAN处理器进行每核性能。</p><p> On the next page we will go through AMD’s Milan processor stack, and its comparison to Rome as well as the comparison to current Intel offerings. We then go through our test systems, discussions about our SoC structure testing (cache, core-to-core, bandwidth), processor power, and then into our full benchmarks.</p><p> 在下一页，我们将通过AMD的米兰处理器堆栈，并与罗马的比较以及与当前的英特尔产品的比较。然后我们通过测试系统，讨论我们的SoC结构测试（缓存，核心，带宽），处理器电源，然后进入我们的完整基准测试。 </p><p>  These pages can be accessed by clicking the links, or by using the drop down menu below.</p><p>可以通过单击链接来访问这些页面，或使用下面的下拉菜单访问。</p><p>       In the past AMD has promoted its EPYC positioning in terms of single socket and dual socket setups, mostly on the basis that one of its larger processors can enable the same compute as two of Intel’s top-tier offerings. This time around, AMD actually does little direct comparison with Intel as to where its processors stand, instead focusing on the market optimizations for different elements of the market.</p><p>       在过去的AMD中，在单个插座和双套接字设置方面促进了其EPYC定位，主要是在其较大的处理器之一可以实现与Intel的两层产品相同的计算。这次，AMD实际上与英特尔的直接比较与其处理器站立的位置一样，而是专注于市场优化市场的不同元素。</p><p> AMD market optimizations come in three main flavors: Core Performance, Core Density, Balanced and Optimized.</p><p> AMD市场优化有三种主要的口味：核心性能，核心密度，平衡和优化。</p><p>    The Core Optimized processors were segmented out on the last page as a highlighted part of the processor lineup, now known as AMD’s F series of processors. These parts have F in the name, offer up to 32 cores, and the main focus here is on individual core performance peaks as well as sustained performance. Compared to other parts of a similar core count, these have higher TDP values, and charge a premium.</p><p>    核心优化处理器在最后一页中分段为处理器阵容的突出显示，现在称为AMD的F系列处理器。这些部件以名称为F，提供最多32个核心，此处的主要重点是个人核心性能峰以及持续的性能。与类似核心计数的其他部分相比，这些具有较高的TDP值，并充电溢价。</p><p>  For this review, one of the processors we have tested is the EPYC 75F3, the 32-core processor offering 4.0 GHz turbo, 2.95 GHz base frequency, and all 256 MB of L3 cache. This processor has four cores per chiplet active, and no doubt these processors use the best voltage/frequency response cores inside each chiplet as manufactured. The $4860 price point is above the $3761 for the next best 32-core processor, showcasing some of that premium.</p><p>  对于此评论，我们测试的一个处理器之一是EPYC 75F3，32核处理器提供4.0 GHz Turbo，2.95 GHz基础频率和所有256 MB的L3缓存。该处理器每个钟芯片有四个核心，毫无疑问，这些处理器在每个小芯片中使用最佳电压/频率响应核心制造。 4860美元的价格点高于下一个最佳32核处理器的3761美元，展示了一些溢价。</p><p> Users will notice that the 16-core processor is more expensive ($3521) than the 24 core processor ($2900) here. This was the same in the previous generation, however in that case the 16-core had the higher TDP. For this launch, both the 16-core F and 24-core F have the same TDP, so the only reason I can think of for AMD to have a higher price on the 16-core processor is that it only has 2 cores per chiplet active, rather than three? Perhaps it is easier to bin a processor with an even number of cores active.</p><p> 用户会注意到16核处理器比24个核心处理器（2900美元）更昂贵（3521美元）。这在前一代中是相同的，但在这种情况下，16核的TDP具有更高的TDP。对于此启动，16核F和24-Core F都具有相同的TDP，因此我能够考虑AMD在16核处理器上具有更高价格的唯一原因是它每小芯只有2个核心活跃，而不是三个？也许它更容易用偶数核心活动的处理器。</p><p> At the bottom is AMD’s sole 8-core offering, meaning only 1 core per chiplet, and zero contention for L3 cache. It also has a small range in frequency, which should enable deterministic workloads – despite the 180 W listed TDP, a 4.1 GHz Zen 3 core should not need more than 10 W per core, which leaves a lot of power for any configuration that wants to push the IO a little faster (more on that below).</p><p> 在底部是AMD的唯一​​8核产品，意味着每个小芯片只有1个核心，并为L3缓存的零争用。它还具有频率的小范围，这应该能够实现确定性工作负载 - 尽管180W上市TDP，但4.1 GHz Zen 3核心每个核心不需要超过10 W，这为想要的任何配置留下了大量的电力推动IO一点速度更快（下面更多）。 </p><p> All of these processors are aimed for systems that run software that is limited by single thread workloads, such as EDA tools, or for software that needs a lot of IO but can be limited by per-core licensing restrictions. All of these processors can be use in dual socket configurations.</p><p>所有这些处理器都针对运行由单线程工作负载（例如EDA工具）的软件的系统，或者对于需要大量IO的软件，但可以受到每核许可限制的限制。所有这些处理器都可以用于双套接字配置。</p><p>  As part of the processor lineup, AMD is highlighting all of its high-core count products as being core density optimized, and systems built to take advantage of lower memory channel interleaving configurations (see below) could be built to the scale of 384 cores or 768 threads per 1U.</p><p>  作为处理器阵容的一部分，AMD突出显示其所有高芯计数产品，作为核心密度优化，并且可以利用较低的内存通道交错配置（见下文）构建的系统可以建立在384核的比例范围内或每1U 768线程。</p><p> The new halo top-of-stack processor, the 64-core EPYC 7763, naturally fits into this segment. At 280 W, it adds another 40 W to the top processor publicly available from AMD, along with increasing both base frequency and turbo frequency as well as offering additional IPC gains. The price has increased by just under $1000 to represent where AMD believes it fits into this market.</p><p> 新的光晕顶部堆叠处理器，64核EPYC 7763，自然地适合该段。在280 W处，它将另外40 W增加到顶级处理器，从AMD公开提供，随着基础频率和涡轮增压频率以及提供额外的IPC增益。价格在1000美元以下的价格增加到AMD认为它适合这个市场。</p><p>  AMD considers the EPYC 7763 as ‘a step up’ from the previous top-of-stack processor, the 7742. The direct replacement to the 64-core 7742 in this case is the 7713. We’ve tested both of the Milan and the 7742 Rome for this review, so we get to see how much of an uplift the new processors are.</p><p>  AMD将EPYC 7763从前一堆堆叠处理器中的“一步”，7742。在这种情况下，对64核7742的直接替换是7713.我们已经测试过米兰和米兰7742罗马进行了此评论，所以我们可以看到新处理器的隆起是多少。</p><p> Also part of the Core Density family is the first single socket processor, the 7713P. This is identical to the 7713, however does not support 2P configurations. As a result it comes in at $2000 cheaper.</p><p> 也是核心密度系列的一部分是第一个单个插座处理器，7713p。这与7713相同，但不支持2P配置。结果，它价格在2000美元便宜。</p><p> The other interesting member of the family is the 7663, a 56 core processor. This configuration means that AMD is using 7 cores per chiplet, rather than the full 8, which is a configuration that AMD did not have with the previous generation. It would appear that AMD’s customers have requested a model like this, optimized for their workloads where less cache contention might be needed, or for workloads that won’t scale all the way to 64 cores.</p><p> 家庭的其他有趣成员是7663，一个56个核心处理器。此配置意味着AMD使用每个小芯片的7个核心，而不是完整的8，这是AMD与上一代没有的配置。似乎AMD的客户已请求这样的型号，为其工作负载进行了优化，其中可能需要较少的缓存争用，或者对于不会将所有方式扩展到64个核心的工作负载。</p><p>  The rest of AMD’s portfolio of Milan processors comes under the ‘Balanced and Optimized’ banner, and this is where AMD will offer its 16-32 core processors as well as the rest of the 1P single socket parts.</p><p>  AMD的其余部分的米兰处理器组合来自“平衡和优化”的横幅，这是AMD将提供其16-32个核心处理器以及剩下的1P单插座部件的地方。 </p><p>  Almost all of these processors half the L3 cache to 128 MB, suggesting that these processors only have four active chiplets inside – this allows AMD to optimize its silicon product rather than providing lots of only-half enabled chiplets. This is seen perhaps in the price, as the 8-chiplet 32-core EPYC 7543 is almost $1000 more expensive than the EPYC 7513.</p><p>几乎所有这些处理器都将L3缓存中的一半到128 MB，这表明这些处理器只有四个活动小芯片 - 这允许AMD优化其硅产品，而不是提供大量启用了一半的芯片。这可能是在价格中可能的，因为8-Chiplet 32​​核EPYC 7543比EPYC 7513昂贵1000美元。</p><p> AMD only goes down to 16 cores here – the only 8 core processor is the 72F3 mentioned earlier. Also perhaps striking is that AMD does not go below 155 W TDP, which as we will see later in the review, might be down to some of the IO.</p><p> AMD仅在此处降至16个核心 - 唯一的8个核心处理器是前面提到的72F3。也许引人注目的是，AMD不低于155 W TDP，因为我们将在审查后来看到，可能会归结为一些IO。</p><p>   For those wanting to see all the processors in one table with all the configurable TDP options, here we are. Processors we are testing in this review are highlighted in bold.</p><p>   对于那些希望在一个表中查看所有可配置的TDP选项的表中的所有处理器的人，我们在这里。我们在此评论中进行测试的处理器以粗体突出显示。</p><p>  To fill in some of the demands in costs and offering, AMD is also planning to supply 2 nd Gen EPYC into the market for a good time, enabling both platforms for customers. These include the 32-core 7532, 24-core 7352, 16-core 7282, and a couple of 8-core processors.</p><p>  为了填补成本和产品的一些要求，AMD还计划为市场提供2个ND Gen Epyc，以便为客户提供良好的时光，为客户提供平台。这些包括32核7532,24芯7352,16芯7282和几个8核处理器。</p><p>  Direct comparisons are always made against the previous generation, and these are the suggested comparisons:</p><p>  始终针对前一代进行直接比较，这些是建议的比较：</p><p>    In our interview with AMD’s Forrest Norrod, he explained that the original goal of Milan was to update Rome’s 8-core chiplets from Zen 2 to Zen 3, but a number of factors meant that the central IO die also received updates, both on the power side and for Infinity Fabric performance.</p><p>    在我们对AMD的Forrest Norrod采访中，他解释说，米兰的原始目标是将罗马的8核心小柱从Zen 2更新到Zen 3，但许多因素意味着中央IO死亡也接受了电力的更新侧面和无限织物性能。</p><p> Beyond the core updates from Zen 2 to Zen 3, which we’ve covered extensively in our consumer coverage, AMD has enabled several key features with Milan.</p><p> 除了ZEN 2到ZEN 3的核心更新，我们在消费者覆盖范围内广泛涵盖，AMD已启用米兰的几个关键功能。 </p><p>  The enterprise and datacenter markets involve a vast array of potential workloads, some are compute-bound, some are memory-bound, but the goal has always been to get the work done as quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible, and as cheaply as possible. The larger companies will often optimize their deployments in every way imaginable, and that includes memory.</p><p>企业和数据中心市场涉及大量的潜在工作负载，有些是计算束缚，有些是内存绑定的，但目标一直是尽可能快地完成工作，尽可能快地完成工作，并且尽可能快地完成工作可能的。较大的公司通常会以可想而想的各种方式优化其部署，并包含内存。</p><p> AMD admits that there is a portion of the market that is very much memory-bound, either in capacity, latency, or bandwidth. These customers will keep demanding higher capacity support, faster memory, or just more memory channels for both capacity or bandwidth. We’ve been told that there is a holistic split at some level between these sorts of customers, and those that are simply compute-bound, which may come to a head with differentiated products in the future. But for now, we have eight-channel DDR4 processors on the market, which is not-enough for some customers, but plenty for others who don’t need all that capacity or bandwidth.</p><p> AMD承认，市场的一部分是非常多的内存，无论是容量，延迟还是带宽。这些客户将继续苛刻的容量支持，更快的内存，或者对于容量或带宽的更多内存通道。我们被告知，在这些客户之间的某种程度上有一个整体分裂，以及简单地计算的人，这可能会在未来与差异化产品的头部。但是现在，我们在市场上有八声道DDR4处理器，这对一些客户来说不够，但对于不需要所有容量或带宽的人来说，这很多。</p><p> It’s the latter customers where optimizations may occur. For example, if memory bandwidth or capacity is not a limiting factor, then those customers can design systems with fewer memory channels being used. This helps by increasing density, making physical system design simpler, perhaps cooling, but also by disabling those memory channels, more power is available for their compute-bound systems. We came to a point in the previous generation lifecycle where we were starting to see motherboards enter the market with fewer than eight memory slots for these reasons.</p><p> 它是可能发生优化的后一种客户。例如，如果内存带宽或容量不是限制因素，那么这些客户可以使用正在使用更少的内存通道的设计系统。这通过增加密度，使物理系统设计更简单，也许是冷却，而且还通过禁用那些内存通道，可以为其计算绑定系统提供更多的电力。我们在前一代生命周期中来到了一点，我们开始看到主板输入市场，因为这些原因少于八个内存插槽。</p><p> In order to get the best performance, or reliable performance, from the memory (and not experience any NUMA or silo effects), the memory installed needs to have effective memory interleaving enabled on what is installed. AMD EPYC in the past has supported 8-channel interleaving and 4-channel interleaving, but for Milan, AMD is also supporting 6-channel interleaving for customers that build in those configurations. Four and Eight are obvious powers of two for AMD to have included by default, but enough demand for Six was there to enable an update to the IO die to support this mode.</p><p> 为了获得最佳性能或可靠的性能，从内存（而不经历任何NUMA或筛选效果），安装的内存需要在安装的内容上启用有效的内存交织。 AMD EPYC在过去支持了8通道交错和4频道交错，但对于米兰，AMD也支持6声道交错，为那些配置构建的客户。四个和八个是两个用于AMD的显而易举的力量，默认情况下，但足够的要求六是在那里启用IO DIE的更新以支持这种模式。</p><p>  AMD has confirmed that 6-channel memory interleaving, when using one module per channel, will be supported on all Milan processors.</p><p>  AMD已确认所有米兰处理器都支持6通道内存交错，当使用每个通道的一个模块时，都会支持所有米兰处理器。</p><p>  The effects of Spectre, Meltdown, and its variants have repurposed processor security to be more proactive at all the major microprocessor designers and manufacturers. AMD has implemented fixes in hardware for the Spectre variants to which it was susceptible, and hasn’t needed to add additional protection from Meltdown and its variants as AMD CPUs are not naturally vulnerable.</p><p>  幽灵，崩溃的影响及其变体已经重新培育了处理器安全性，在所有主要的微处理器设计师和制造商处更加积极主动。 AMD已经为其易感的幽灵变体实施了硬件的修复，并且不需要添加额外的保护，因为AMD CPU不自然易受攻击。</p><p>  The new segment of attacks beyond these are based on return address programming, and effectively adjusting the control flow of code on the processors by manipulating stack return addresses or jump/control commands. AMD implemented a fix for these sorts of attacks in its Zen 3 core, and these fixes get passed into EPYC Milan, known as ‘Shadow Stacks’. These are hardware based solutions, enabling a minimal effect to performance, but absolutely required for security.</p><p>  超出这些攻击的新段基于返回地址编程，并通过操纵堆栈返回地址或跳转/控制命令有效地调整处理器上的代码控制流程。 AMD在ZEN 3核心中实施了这些攻击的修复，这些修复程序通过了EPYC米兰，称为“阴影堆栈”。这些是基于硬件的解决方案，为性能实现了最小的效果，但安全性绝对需要。 </p><p>  The other segment to AMD’s security updates is Secure Nested Paging, part of AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization technology. These technologies all deal with hyperscalers enabling multiple host instances on a single system, and being able to protect the instances from each other. In previous generation Rome, Secure Encrypted Virtualization allowed a secure hypervisor to isolate these instances or virtual machines from each other in a secure and encrypted way (hence the name).</p><p>另一个部分到AMD的安全更新是安全的分页，部分AMD安全加密虚拟化技术。这些技术均处理超高高速公路，在单个系统上启用多个主机实例，并且能够彼此保护实例。在上一代罗马中，安全的加密虚拟化允许安全管理程序以安全和加密的方式彼此隔离这些实例或虚拟机（因此名称）。</p><p>  Secure Nested Paging takes this one stage further, and enables additional security of the virtual machines from the hypervisor itself. This allows protection against an untrusted hypervisor, should an attacker get access, as well as support for software running on unmodified guest operating systems for which the software was originally not built for.</p><p>  Secure嵌套分页进一步占据该阶段，并从管理程序本身允许额外的虚拟机安全性。这允许防止不受信任的虚拟机管理程序，如果攻击者访问访问，并支持对最初未构建软件的未经修改的客户操作系统上运行的软件。</p><p>  One of the big updates from the Zen 2 core complex to the Zen 3 core complex in all of AMD’s product families was the size of that complex, moving from four cores to eight cores. This means that in an eight core chiplet, rather than there being two complexes of four cores and a separated L3 cache, there is now a single eight core complex with a unified cache. As seen in our consumer reviews, this matters a lot for memory-heavy operation as well as branch heavy code. Another benefit is that the control electronics for the complex are now at the edge of the chiplet, providing some small improvement.</p><p>  在所有AMD的产品系列中Zen 2核心复合体的Zen 2核心复合体中的一个大更新之一是该复杂的大小，从四个核心转移到八个核心。这意味着在八个核心小芯片中，而不是有四个核和分离的L3缓存的两个复合体，现在具有统一缓存的单个八个核心复合体。如在我们的消费者评论中所见，记忆力运行以及分支重型代码很重要。另一个好处是，该复合物的控制电子器件现在处于小芯片的边缘，提供一些小的改善。</p><p>  We’ll go into how exactly the cache structure changes later in the review.</p><p>  我们将在审核中稍后改变缓存结构的究竟如何变化。</p><p> The other angle to Milan’s performance in IO is on the Infinity Fabric and PCIe. For this generation, AMD has enabled 18 Gbps Infinity Fabric links over its SERDES connections, up from the previous generation 16 Gbps links. This might come across as slightly minor, but it should enable better performance in a competitive core-to-core communications environment.</p><p> 另一个角度到米兰在IO中的表现是无限的织物和PCIe。对于此一代，AMD已启用18个Gbps Infinity Fabric链接，从前一代16 Gbps链路。这可能遇到略微略有，但它应该在竞争力的核心通信环境中实现更好的性能。</p><p> AMD is also supporting Extended Speed Modes on its PCIe links with Milan. This is part of the PCIe 4.0 standa</p><p> AMD还支持与米兰的PCIe链接上的扩展速度模式。这是PCIe 4.0的一部分</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.anandtech.com/print/16529/amd-epyc-milan-review">https://www.anandtech.com/print/16529/amd-epyc-milan-review</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/epyc/">#epyc</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/amd/">#amd</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
