Pipedrive is an EU-based CRM company with offices in eight countries, but it has a Czech co-founder in VP of Product Martin Henk, one of several founders to emerge from the ecosystem.</p><p>捷克共和国可能会为啤酒，曲棍球和布拉格景点而闻名，但其创业界和任何人都是雄心勃勃的。 Pipedrive是一家以八所国家的办事处为基于欧盟的CRM公司，但它在产品Martin Henk的VP中有一个捷克联合创始人，其中几个创始人之一被生态系统出现。</p><p> Then there was Integromat, which did not raise any external capital but sold for around 2.5 billion crowns ($114 million), making its seven Czech founders into multimillionaires.

The advice is to “be frugal to accommodate to the new situation and roll on.”</p><p>大多数人表示，他们的投资没有受到Covid-19的显着影响，但未来的不确定是一个问题。建议是“节俭，以适应新的情况并滚动”。</p><p> As far as green shoots, COVID-19 has “played a role of an accelerator for innovation in many business areas and even e-government and other rigid/conservative industries,” said one. D2C startups have benefitted and “Zoom selling” now seems “totally plausible.”</p><p> 至于绿笋，Covid-19已经“在许多商业领域甚至电子政务和其他刚性/保守派行业的创新中发挥了加速器的作用，” D2C初创公司受益，现在“缩放销售”似乎“完全合理”。</p><p>       Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

They are forced to pivot and accommodate to this new world.</p><p> 您希望在多年来主要城市以外的地理位置出色的更多创始人中看到一个激增，因为初创公司因大流行和挥之不去的关切而失去了人们，加上遥远工作的吸引力？远程工作不是一个问题，但大流行对初创公司的影响巨大。他们被迫枢转并容纳这个新世界。</p><p> Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?

We are trying to be the most founder-friendly fund in the region. As an ex-founder (Olek) I love speaking with and advising all startups that come my way :)</p><p> 您想要与TechCrunch Reader分享的其他任何想法？我们正试图成为该地区最创办的基金。作为一个ex-forder（Olek），我喜欢和我的方式发言并建议我的方式:)</p><p>    What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? Outstanding founders tackling big opportunity.</p><p>    您在下次投资中寻找什么？优秀的创始人解决了大机遇。</p><p> Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup?

AI is overhyped but most AI are actually not that intelligent.</p><p> 哪个领域要么过分，或者太难在这一点上竞争新的启动？您对哪些其他类型的产品/服务有什么要求或担心？ VR / AR一直是有很多投资的地区，因此非常具竞争力。 AI被过度普遍存在，但大多数AI实际上不是那么聪明。</p><p> How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general?

What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders? Central Europe is well positioned in automation, security, developer tools and analytics. I’m most excited about UiPath, Productboard, Pricefx, TypingDNA, Spaceflow, Around (in our portfolio). Best CE founders are in my view Daniel Dines, Hubert Palan, Marcin Cichon plus Oliver Dlouhý (Kiwi.com).</p><p> 您所在城市和地区的哪些行业似乎很好地茁壮成长，长期茁壮成长？您对（您的投资组合或不是）兴奋的公司是什么？中欧在自动化，安全性，开发人员工具和分析中有很好的定位。我对UIPATH，Productboard，PriceFX，TypingDNA，Spaceflow，周围（在我们的投资组合中）非常兴奋。最好的CE创始人位于我的观点中，我的观点在丹尼尔·帕彭·帕兰，Marcin Cichon Plus OliverDlouhō（kiwi.com）。</p><p> How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city? There are a lot of great developers in Prague, good energy and enough success stories and role models to follow. There is a lot of investment capital there (just as everywhere else I guess), not too much smart money yet, so definitely opportunity for good VCs to take a look (and they are looking).</p><p> 其他城市的投资者应该如何考虑城市的整体投资气候和机遇？布拉格有很多伟大的开发人员，能源良好，成功的成功案例和榜样跟随。那里有很多投资资本（就像我猜的其他地方），也没有太多聪明的钱，所以肯定是良好的VCS来看看的机会（他们正在寻找）。 </p><p> Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work? I have no doubts that the pandemic has been accelerating remote work, which ultimately should lead to more remote-first startups which might benefit new geos.</p><p>您希望在多年来主要城市以外的地理位置出色的更多创始人中看到一个激增，因为初创公司因大流行和挥之不去的关切而失去了人们，加上遥远工作的吸引力？我毫无疑问，大流行一直加速遥控工作，最终应该导致可能有利于新的地磁的更多偏远启动。</p><p> Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times? Travel and hospitality seem most fragile and unpredictable due to COVID-19. Remote and enabling remote seem like the biggest opportunity; automation and enabling digital transformation are attractive as well.</p><p> 哪些行业细分市场看起来越来越弱或更为暴露于由于Covid-19而导致消费者和商业行为的潜在转变？启动机会的机会是什么可以在这些前所未有的时间内进行挖掘？旅行和酒店似乎最脆弱，由于Covid-19，不可预测。遥控器和启用遥控似乎是最大的机会;自动化和启用数字转换也很有吸引力。</p><p> How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now? Our investment strategy is unchanged; actually we’ll double down on it. There is a lot of opportunity for good tech startups, technology is what’s helping people and countries to get out of crises faster with less damage. Our advice to startups is still the same: Focus on your cause and try to solve problems in your space better than anybody else.</p><p> Covid-19如何影响您的投资策略？您的投资组合中的创始人最大的担忧是什么？您现在在投资组合中启动的建议是什么？我们的投资策略不变;实际上我们会逐渐下来。良好的技术初创公司有很多机会，技术是帮助人们和各国更快地摆脱危机，损坏较少。我们对初创公司的建议仍然是相同的：专注于您的原因，并尝试更好地解决您的空间中的问题。</p><p> Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic? We definitely see green shoots in some of the enterprise software companies. “Zoom selling” now seems totally plausible, sales cycles shortened in some verticals as companies need to digitize and enable remote work.</p><p> 您是否在对大流行适应流行时看到“绿色射击”是关于您的投资组合中的收入增长，保留或其他势头？我们肯定会在一些企业软件公司中看到绿色拍摄。 “缩放销售”现在看起来完全合理，在一些垂直方面缩短了销售周期，因为公司需要数字化和偏远的工作。</p><p> What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two. I’ve always had hope. Yes, there have been low moments especially when quarantined, but overall I haven’t lost hope for people to cope with this unprecedented situation, and for technology to play a significant role in the recovery. I still have this hope :)</p><p> 在上个月左右给你希望的时刻是什么？这可以是专业，个人或两者的混合。我一直希望。是的，特别是当被隔离时的低点，但总体而言，我没有失去希望人们应对这个前所未有的情况，以及技术在复苏中发挥重要作用。我还有这个希望:)</p><p> Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers? I feel like I had been traveling too much, two- or three-day transatlantic trips make little sense and I think I won’t go back there. Also, I don’t think I’ll go back to 5+ days in the office every week, home office works fine with me and it will stay with me and the company in some capacity. That being said, it is what I feel now. I may be wrong and things may go back to “old normal” — which I would consider a big mistake and lost opportunity.</p><p> 您想要与TechCrunch Reader分享的其他任何想法？我觉得我一直在旅行太多，两天或三天的跨大西洋旅行略微有道理，我想我不会回到那里。此外，我不认为我每周都会回到5天的办公室，家庭办公室与我良好，它将与我和公司留在一些能力。所说，这是我现在的感受。我可能是错的，事情可能会回到“旧正常” - 我会考虑一个大错误和失去机会。</p><p>   What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally? We are looking for synergies with our parent company O2 Czech republic and other companies under the PPF Group.</p><p>   通常，你最兴奋的趋势是什么？我们正在寻找与PPF集团下的母公司O2捷克共和国和其他公司的协同作用。 </p><p>  Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? We would like to see more insurtech startups in Europe.</p><p>有初创公司，你希望你能在行业中看到但不是吗？现在有什么忽视的机会？我们希望在欧洲看到更多芦苇初创公司。</p><p> What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? We are looking for synergies with our partner companies rather looking into a specific branch.</p><p> 您在下次投资中寻找什么？我们正在寻找与伙伴公司相同调查特定分支的协同作用。</p><p> Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about? Fintech is oversaturated with very low margins.</p><p> 哪个领域要么过分，或者太难在这一点上竞争新的启动？您对哪些其他类型的产品/服务有什么要求或担心？ Fintech非常低利润。</p><p> How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less? We mostly invest locally, but our most successful investment was in Taxify (now Bolt).</p><p> 您在普遍上专注于投资当地生态系统（或各处）的范围内收费多少？超过50％？较少的？我们大多在本地投资，但我们最成功的投资是在Taxifice（现在的螺栓）中。</p><p> Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders? Definitely security domain is best positioned. We are excited about IP Fabric (founder is ex-Cisco CEO Pavel Bykov), Whalebone (R. Malovič), Wultra (P. Dvořák).</p><p> 您所在城市和地区的哪些行业似乎很好地茁壮成长，长期茁壮成长？您对（您的投资组合或不是）兴奋的公司是什么？绝对安全域是最好的。我们对IP Fabric兴奋（创始人是Ex-Cisco Ceo Pavel Bykov），Wultra（P.Dvoğák）。</p><p> How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city? The interest is bigger, a lot of successful startups raise demand for opportunities.</p><p> 其他城市的投资者应该如何考虑城市的整体投资气候和机遇？利息更大，很多成功的初创公司提出了对机会的需求。</p><p> Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work? We don’t think so, local network is important. Remote work is not for everyone.</p><p> 您希望在多年来主要城市以外的地理位置出色的更多创始人中看到一个激增，因为初创公司因大流行和挥之不去的关切而失去了人们，加上遥远工作的吸引力？我们不这么认为，本地网络很重要。远程工作不是每个人的。 </p><p> Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times? There will be shifts in retail. This is an opportunity for startups like Pygmalios, which provide analytics for retail.</p><p>哪些行业细分市场看起来越来越弱或更为暴露于由于Covid-19而导致消费者和商业行为的潜在转变？启动机会的机会是什么可以在这些前所未有的时间内进行挖掘？将有零售业转变。这是Pygmalios的初创公司的机会，它为零售提供了分析。</p><p> How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now? Luckily the impact is not big. Biggest worries are about difficulties with travel abroad for business meetings. Our advice is hold the runway longer :-)</p><p> Covid-19如何影响您的投资策略？您的投资组合中的创始人最大的担忧是什么？您现在在投资组合中启动的建议是什么？幸运的是影响并不大。最大的担忧是出国旅游遇到商务会议的困难。我们的建议持有跑道更长:-)</p><p> Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic? Yes, demand for call center tools like omnichannel solution mluvii.com, which works at the home office move up significantly.</p><p> 您是否在对大流行适应流行时看到“绿色射击”是关于您的投资组合中的收入增长，保留或其他势头？是的，对呼叫中心工具的需求，如omnichannel解决方案mluvii.com，在家庭办公室工作明显增加。</p><p> What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two. At spring our country was “best in COVID” and now it is “worst in COVID.” Last spring thousands of people from the startup community helped and came up with brilliant ideas, apps and solutions but at the end most outcomes (like  eRouška and  https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/) were screwed by slow or faulty decisions of government. Instead of hope I’m disappointed, but I believe that vaccination will help us to get life back on the track.</p><p> 在上个月左右给你希望的时刻是什么？这可以是专业，个人或两者的混合。在春天，我国是“最适合的Covid”，现在它是“Covid中最糟糕的”。比赛春天来自初创公司的数千人帮助并提出了辉煌的想法，应用程序和解决方案，但最终的成果（如Erouška和https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/en/）被慢或有缺陷的决定搞砸了政府。而不是希望我很失望，但我相信疫苗接种会帮助我们让生活回到轨道上。</p><p> Who are key startup people you see creating success locally, whether investors, founders or even other types of startup ecosystems roles like lawyers, designers, growth experts, etc. We’re trying to highlight the movers and shakers who outsiders might not know. Patrik Juránek from Startup Disrupt community.</p><p> 谁是关键的初创人，您在本地创建成功，是否投资者，创始人甚至其他类型的创业生态系统，如律师，设计师，增长专家等我们正试图突出推动者和散步者可能不知道的搬运工。来自启动中的PatrikJuránek扰乱了社区。</p><p> Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers? Prague is great and safe city for living — when you setup a branch in Prague you can attract people from all of the CEE region to move in.</p><p> 您想要与TechCrunch Reader分享的其他任何想法？布拉格是生活的伟大和安全的城市 - 当你在布拉格设置一个分支时，你可以吸引来自所有CEE地区的人员进入。</p><p>  What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally? Anything that helps businesses run smarter is something we would like to take a look at. More specifically we are interested in areas such as Internet of Things, smart factories, smart cities, smart office, cybersecurity, big data and AR/VR. And especially when there is some kind of hardware involved — that something we really love.</p><p>  通常，你最兴奋的趋势是什么？任何帮助企业跑步更聪明的东西都是我们想看看的东西。更具体地说，我们对事物，智能工厂，智能城市，智能办公，网络安全，大数据和AR / VR等领域感兴趣。特别是当有某种硬件时 - 我们真正爱的东西。 </p><p>  Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? It would be great to see more startups focusing on hardware.

Apart from the “obvious” aspects such as innovativeness, global potential, scalability, strong team and fit with our investment thesis, we look for founders who show great strategic thinking and execution skills, who really understand the market and their customers’ needs and listen to feedback.</p><p> 您在下次投资中寻找什么？除了创新，全球潜力，可扩展性，强大的团队等“明显”方面，与我们的投资论证相处，我们寻找表现出伟大的战略思维和执行技能的创始人，他真正了解市场和客户的需求和倾听反馈。</p><p> Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about? Considering our focus on B2B, we have better overview of this part of the economy. Lately, we have seen a huge number of startups using AI/ML for computer vision or natural language processing use cases creating very similar products, meaning it will be rather difficult for them to differentiate and outperform the rest of the competition. But that does not mean that a new revolutionary idea cannot appear.</p><p> 哪个领域要么过分，或者太难在这一点上竞争新的启动？您对哪些其他类型的产品/服务有什么要求或担心？考虑到我们对B2B的关注，我们更好地概述了这部分经济。最近，我们已经看到了使用AI / ML的大量启动，用于计算机视觉或自然语言处理用例创建了非常相似的产品，这意味着它们将相当困难，以区分和优于竞争的其余部分。但这并不意味着一个新的革命性想法不能出现。</p><p> How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less? Our focus is on the Central European region — so far we have invested in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but we are open to founders from other neighboring countries as well. The majority of our portfolio is located in the Brno/South Moravia region, where Y Soft is based. It is not an outcome of an intentional strategy, but just the reality of which startups interested us the most.</p><p> 您在普遍上专注于投资当地生态系统（或各处）的范围内收费多少？超过50％？较少的？我们的重点是在中欧地区 - 到目前为止，我们已经投资于捷克共和国和斯洛伐克，但我们也对来自其他邻国的创始人开放。我们的大多数投资组合位于布尔诺/南摩拉拉维亚地区，Y软件是基于的。这不是一个故意战略的结果，而是初创公司的现实最为感兴趣。</p><p> Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders? Generally, the Czech startup ecosystem is getting more mature, especially thanks to serial entrepreneurs as well as more experienced first-time founders, and the developing business angel/VC ecosystem. It is hard to pick just one industry, as the spectrum of companies is very vast.</p><p> 您所在城市和地区的哪些行业似乎很好地茁壮成长，长期茁壮成长？您对（您的投资组合或不是）兴奋的公司是什么？一般来说，捷克启动生态系统正在变得更加成熟，特别是由于串行企业家以及更有经验的首次创始人以及开发商业天使/ VC生态系统。很难选择一个行业，因为公司的谱非常浩大。</p><p> How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city? From the investors’ point of view, the Czech startup ecosystem can provide a lot of interesting opportunities, and especially for foreign investors the investments can be a “good value for money,” even though the VC ecosystem has become more competitive in the last years due to influx of new money. The seed and partly Series A segment can be seen as rather saturated, but there is a significant potential in the larger Series A or later-stage investments.</p><p> 其他城市的投资者应该如何考虑城市的整体投资气候和机遇？从投资者的角度来看，捷克启动生态系统可以提供很多有趣的机会，特别是对于外国投资者来说，投资可能是“物有所值”，即使VC生态系统在过去几年变得更具竞争力由于新资金的涌入。种子和部分串联段可以看出相当饱和，但较大的阶段或后期投资中存在显着潜力。</p><p> Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work? The main Czech hubs, Prague and Brno, are probably not going to see their status weakened, as they are not only business centers, but also have the main universities where the talented people are and are hearts of the cultural life that is attractive to many. But we will see a shift toward remote woking, allowing founders to tap a wider talent pool.</p><p> 您希望在多年来主要城市以外的地理位置出色的更多创始人中看到一个激增，因为初创公司因大流行和挥之不去的关切而失去了人们，加上遥远工作的吸引力？主要的捷克枢纽，布拉格和布尔诺，可能不会看到他们的地位削弱，因为它们不仅是商业中心，而且还有才华的主要大学，是许多人的文化生活中的心灵的心。但我们将看到遥远的扫荡的转变，让创始人挖掘更广泛的人才池。 </p><p> Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times? We believe that after the shock caused by COVID-19 fades away, there will be more opportunities for the companies in segments we invest in, as the induced trends are only forcing businesses to run smarter. The trends most relevant to us will be those associated with accelerated digital transformation, changes in supply chains and evolution of workspaces.</p><p>哪些行业细分市场看起来越来越弱或更为暴露于由于Covid-19而导致消费者和商业行为的潜在转变？启动机会的机会是什么可以在这些前所未有的时间内进行挖掘？我们认为，在Covid-19逐渐消失后，在我们投资的段中将有更多机会，因为诱导趋势只是强迫企业越来越聪明的企业。与我们最相关的趋势将是与加速数字转型相关的趋势，供应链的变化和工作区的演变。</p><p> How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now? COVID-19 has not impacted our strategy. The only changes were on the tactical level, as for a certain period of time we shifted more capacities to portfolio support. Most of our founders had to deal with a negative impact on their sales funnel, as some customers postponed or cancelled the planned deals. Some of the founders had to deal with disruptions in the distribution channels, as some of their partners’ businesses were hit rather hard, and a small number of companies had to resolve issues with their supply chain. These challenges are still, to an extent, worries to our portfolio companies, as the economic development is still uncertain. To deal with the situation, cash flow became the main focus, together with more active communication with key business partners throughout the value chains.</p><p> Covid-19如何影响您的投资策略？您的投资组合中的创始人最大的担忧是什么？您现在在投资组合中启动的建议是什么？ Covid-19没有影响我们的战略。唯一的变化是在战术层面上，正如一定时间的时间，我们向投资组合支持转移了更多的能力。我们的大多数创始人必须处理对其销售漏斗的负面影响，因为一些客户推迟或取消计划优惠。一些创始人必须处理分销渠道中断，因为他们的一些合作伙伴的企业被击中了相当困难，并且少数公司不得不解决其供应链问题。随着经济发展仍然不确定，这些挑战仍然是对我们的投资组合企业的担忧。为了解决这种情况，现金流成为主要焦点，以及在整个价值链中与关键业务合作伙伴更积极的沟通。</p><p> Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt </p><p> 您是否在适应时看到了“绿色拍摄”的收入增长，保留或其他动力</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/8-czech-vcs-on-green-shoots-pandemic-impacts-and-2021-opportunities/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/8-czech-vcs-on-green-shoots-pandemic-impacts-and-2021-opportunities/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/vcs/">#vcs</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
