This meant an overhaul and re-write of the quantitative modelling, portfolio optimisation, and research platforms, completely replacing an ecosystem that had developed incrementally over the course of 25 years. The project was one of the largest and most ambitious in the firm&#39;s history, and on 31 December 2019, after nearly five years of effort, the final vestiges of the legacy system were decommissioned.</p><p>2015年，人类数字开始从SA到Python重新平台和迁移其业务的过程。这意味着大修和重写定量建模，投资组合优化和研究平台，完全取代了在25年的过程中逐步发展的生态系统。该项目是该公司最大，最雄心勃勃的历史，2019年12月31日，经过近五年的努力，遗产制度的最终遗弃情况被退役。</p><p> This post will reflect on that transition effort, discussing the rationale for the initiative and attempt an unbiased (if admittedly ex-post) assessment of the costs, risks, and benefits. Further, it will highlight some of the strategies used by the team to make an enormous project a bit more tractable, to maintain momentum, and most importantly, to mitigate risk.</p><p> 该职位将反映该职位，讨论该倡议的理由，并试图对费用，风险和福利进行无偏见的（如果是允许的事后）的评估。此外，它将突出团队使用的一些策略，使巨大的项目更具易行，维持势头，最重要的是减轻风险。</p><p>  The decision to migrate Man Numeric away from the SAS programming language and onto Python was not taken lightly. Completely re-platforming a company is a costly and risky undertaking. Joel Spolsky, Co-Founder of StackOverflow, summarises the conventional wisdom about a full, from-scratch re-write in the title of his classic essay:  &#34;Things you should never do&#34; - and the literature since then tends to agree with him.</p><p>  迁移Man数字远离SAS编程语言和Python的决定并未轻描淡写。完全重新平台公司是一个昂贵和冒险的事业。 Capoverflow的联合创始人Joel Spolsky总结了关于完整的传统智慧，从划痕重新写入他的经典文章的标题：＆＃34;你永远不应该做的事情＆＃34; - 从那以后的文献往往会同意他的意见。</p><p> Furthermore, the SAS platform had facilitated the firm&#39;s emergence as an early leader in Quantitative Equity investment. The platform had decades of flight hours, during which it accrued an invaluable amount of nuanced information about the data and markets it traded. It had weathered the Quant Crisis of 2007 and the GFC shortly afterwards, and by 2015 had yielded several consecutive years of historically positive performance.</p><p> 此外，SAS平台促进了该公司的出现作为定量股权投资的早期领导者。该平台有几十年的飞行时间，在此期间，它累计了有关它交易的数据和市场的无价值数量。它已经在2007年的量牌和GFC的量危机之后，到2015年，在历史积极绩效连续几年内产生了几年。</p><p> However, over the course of over 20 years, the SAS platform had accrued a great deal of complexity. Changes required significant resources. In an increasingly competitive industry, it was becoming harder and harder to stay nimble and bring innovation quickly to market.</p><p> 然而，在20多年的过程中，SAS平台已经累计了很多复杂性。更改需要大量资源。在一个越来越竞争的行业中，它变得越来越难以保持灵活，并将创新迅速迅速到市场上。</p><p> In addition to the desire for greater agility, the 2014 acquisition of Numeric Investors by Man Group also played an important role in the direction and resourcing of the re-platforming effort. Though the decision to begin re-platforming had already been made, the acquisition brought Numeric into collaboration with Man AHL, which had recently accomplished a Python conversion of its own. This new partnership provided crucial support in terms of infrastructure and prior art.</p><p> 除了渴望更高的敏捷性之外，2014年人民集团的商品投资者的收购也在重新平台努力的方向和资源方面发挥了重要作用。虽然已经进行了开始重新平台的决定已经进行了，但收购将数字带入与Man AHL的合作，最近完成了自己的Python转换。这项新伙伴关系为基础设施和现有技术方面提供了重要的支持。</p><p>  Man Numeric briefly explored a number of options before settling on Python. Joining forces with Man Group of course made the decision easier, but other factors were important to consider as well.</p><p>  在解决Python之前，人类数字在解决之前简要探讨了许多选项。与人类组的联盟队伍当然更容易做出决定，但其他因素也很重要。 </p><p> Python was quickly becoming the de-facto language for data science, machine learning and natural language processing; it would unlock new sources of innovation. Python would allow us to engage with its sizeable open source community, bringing state-of-the-art technology in-house quickly, while allowing for customisation. In a competitive recruiting market, Python would also be much more attractive to top talent; ranked as the most wanted skill by developers and the third most loved language on Stack Overflow. Furthermore, new-hire onboarding could also be accelerated, as new hires would come equipped with the skills necessary to be productive on day one. Finally, a Python platform would allow our researchers, data scientists, and technologists to speak the same language, and find support and advice from a vast online community of other python programmers.</p><p>Python迅速成为数据科学，机器学习和自然语言处理的De-Facto语言;它将解锁新的创新来源。 Python允许我们与其相当大的开源社区进行互动，在允许定制的同时在内部提供最先进的技术。在竞争激烈的招聘市场中，Python也对顶级人才更具吸引力;作为最想要的开发人员和第三个最受欢迎的语言排名为堆栈溢出。此外，还可以加快新雇用的船上，因为新员工将配备有必要的技能在第一天。最后，Python平台将允许我们的研究人员，数据科学家和技术人员讲述相同的语言，并从其他Python程序员的广泛在线社区找到支持和建议。</p><p> All of these benefits serve the same underlying purpose, however: to reduce the cost of innovation.</p><p> 所有这些福利都服务于相同的潜在目的，但是降低了创新成本。</p><p> One drawback that is worth noting for those preparing to embark on a re-platforming, is that while it is open source, Python in a production environment is certainly not “free.” Where the SAS ecosystem is tidy, complete, and batteries-included, Python gives you both the freedom and the obligation to build your ecosystem. Things like package management and data persistence were solved problems in the SAS ecosystem, but required investment to get right in Python.</p><p> 值得注意的是那些准备踏上重新平台的人的一个缺点是，虽然它是开源的，但Python在生产环境中肯定不是“自由”。在整个SAS生态系统整洁的情况下，齐全和包括电池，Python为您提供了构建生态系统的自由和义务。包管理和数据持久性等内容在SAS生态系统中解决了问题，但需要在Python中进行投资。</p><p>  The decision to convert to Python had strong business support and solid rationale, but success was far from inevitable at the outset. In any business, the risk of a project of this nature can be high. When billions of dollars of our client&#39;s money is at stake, if things go wrong the consequences range from the merely devastating (AXA Rosenburg) to completely catastrophic (Knight Capital).</p><p>  转换为Python的决定具有强大的业务支持和坚实的理由，但成功远未在一开始就不可避免。在任何业务中，这种性质项目的风险可以很高。当数十亿美元的客户＆＃39;如果事情出现问题，那么从仅仅毁灭性（Axa Rosenburg）到完全灾难（骑士资本）的后果的后果范围都是如此。</p><p> Aside from the splashy headline failures, there is a subtler brand of failure experienced by countless technology companies: timeline failures. That is, they simply fade into obsolescence focusing all of their efforts on a code re-write and failing to deliver the new features that their clients demand.</p><p> 除了Splashy标题故障之外，还有一个无数技术公司经历的彩色品牌：时间轴故障。也就是说，他们只是淡入过时，重点关注他们在重新编写和未能提供其客户需求的新功能的代码中的所有努力。</p><p> Without a doubt, re-platforming a company is a risky proposition. In fact, it is likely far riskier than a literature review would have you believe, because essays like these undoubtedly suffer from survivorship bias.</p><p> 毫无疑问，重新平台公司是一种冒险的主张。事实上，它可能比文学评论更远的是你相信的，因为这些毫无疑问的论文遭受了生存偏见。</p><p> Mitigating the risk of headline failure, loss of momentum, or a slow fade into obsolescence was of utmost importance, and the strategies that Man Numeric used to do so, including lessons learned, are sufficiently general that they are worth sharing.</p><p> 减轻了标题失败，失去动量的风险，或者缓慢淡入过时至关重要，并且曾经做过的人数字的策略，包括经验教训，足以使他们值得分享。 </p><p>  Determining resource allocation to new business and innovation versus re-platforming is an exercise in deciding between two different types of debt. Focusing 100% of resources on code re-write may deliver it more quickly, but it may also result in insurmountable business debt. In other words, if the company fails to deliver on existing commitments to clients, or to bring new products to market in a competitive time-frame, then it may find itself running an unwinnable race to catch up with the competition once the re-platforming is complete.</p><p>确定新业务和创新与重新平台的资源分配是决定两种不同类型的债务的运动。重点缩点100％的代码重写资源可能会更快地传递它，但也可能导致不可逾越的商业债务。换句话说，如果公司未能向客户提供现有的承诺，或者将新产品带到竞争时间框架中的市场，那么它可能会发现一旦重新平台竞争，就可以赶上竞争不可行的比赛已完成。</p><p> On the other hand, by investing all resources on delivering new products, you will take on technical debt, piling up material to be re-written faster than you can re-write it, leaving legacy software around indefinitely, and failing ever to glean the benefits of re-platforming.</p><p> 另一方面，通过投资所有关于提供新产品的资源，您将承担技术债务，堆积材料重新编写的速度比您可以重新编写，无限期地围绕遗留软件，并失败了重新平台的好处。</p><p> Business debt and technical debt have different risk-reward profiles. Like any form of leverage, neither one is objectively bad (most homeowners didn&#39;t pay in cash up front!), but they have to be managed thoughtfully. Do your best to avoid taking on high-interest debt; make small incremental wins; and take advantage of opportunities which benefit both the re-platforming efforts and business growth.</p><p> 商业债务和技术债务有不同的风险奖励简介。就像任何形式的杠杆一样，既不是客观的坏（大多数房主并没有支付现金！），但他们必须仔细管理。尽力避免接受高利息债务;制作小增量胜利;并利用机会，使重新平台努力和业务增长有益。</p><p> Finally, one decision we made early on was to ring-fence the team responsible for this new platform buildout from other project work. This provided a natural barrier to short term resourcing decisions which may have detracted from our longer-term strategic goals.</p><p> 最后，我们提前做出了一个决定是戒指围栏，该团队负责从其他项目工作中的新平台建设。这为短期资源决策提供了自然障碍，这些决定可能会减少我们的长期战略目标。</p><p>  Full, 100% parity with the previous system was never the goal of Man Numeric&#39;s re platforming; it would have been impractical, and precluded many upgrades that were packaged with the re-write.</p><p>  完整，100％奇偶校验与以前的系统永远不是人类数字的目标＆＃39;重新平台;它本来是不切实际的，并且排除了重写的许多升级。</p><p> In the first few months of the project we built a system to cross-check the outputs of the new platform versus its legacy counterpart, and to flag issues such as a large divergence in correlation or coverage. This system helped keep iteration cycles tight, and it was absolutely necessary, but ultimately not sufficient.</p><p> 在项目的前几个月，我们建立了一个系统，以交叉检查新平台的输出与其遗留对手，并销售诸如相关或覆盖范围大的发散等问题。该系统有助于保持迭代循环紧密，绝对是必要的，但最终不充分。</p><p> Our instrumentation told us how close we were to a full match of the legacy system, but it couldn&#39;t tell us the consequences of the how far away we were. And while the true acceptance criteria was matching return and risk characteristics (within bounds), our initial efforts to cross-check the new platform resulted in developers focusing on an exact output match, a far more challenging undertaking.</p><p> 我们的仪器告诉我们，我们对遗留系统的完整匹配是多么接近，但它不能告诉我们我们有多远的后果。虽然真正的验收标准是匹配的返回和风险特征（范围内），但我们对交叉检查新平台的最初努力导致开发人员关注精确的产出匹配，这是一个更具挑战性的事项。 </p><p> We built the tooling to make the full-scale assessment of historical simulated risk and returns, and the re-platformed signals went through the same due-diligence as any new product, with Man Numeric&#39;s Investment Committee reviewing and signing off each incremental replacement. However, had we started with this by aligning our instrumentation more closely with our acceptance criteria, we might have saved ourselves a lot of time and effort in the long run.</p><p>我们建立了工具，以使历史模拟风险和返回的全面评估，重新平台信号通过与任何新产品相同的争议，具有人类数字＆＃39; S投资委员会审查和签署增量替代。然而，由于我们通过验收标准更紧密地对齐我们的仪器，我们可以在长远来看，我们可以更加紧密地对齐我们的仪器。</p><p>  One way that we were able to manage risk was by replacing pieces of our system incrementally, holding as many variables constant as possible. It was a deliberate process, and it was slow; almost three years passed between the time when our first Python code began handling client money, and the time that we turned off the last piece of the legacy system. Through that time period, we bore the cost of maintaining two systems side-by-side, but had the compensation of increased confidence in the scope of each change that we made.</p><p>  我们能够管理风险的一种方式是通过逐步替换我们的系统，尽可能多的变量。这是一个刻意的过程，它很慢;在我们的第一个Python代码开始处理客户资金的时间之间几乎三年，以及我们关闭了遗留系统的最后一块的时间。通过该时间段，我们并排维护两个系统的成本，但在我们所做的每种变化范围内都有增加的置信度。</p><p> Another benefit of this approach was that it helped to make the project manageable. Incremental delivery meant that each release was small, but it was also real and meaningful, which was important for the morale of a team engaged in a multi-year effort. It also created lots of opportunities for parallelisation.</p><p> 这种方法的另一个好处是它有助于使项目可管理。增量交付意味着每个释放都很小，但它也是真实而有意义的，这对于从事多年努力的团队的士气非常重要。它还为平行化创造了很多机会。</p><p> However, when migrating a system component by component, the path of least resistance leads to a system architecture that looks a lot like your legacy system. It was important for us to define boundaries between systems components where we thought they ought to go, not where they happen to already be. In some cases this was practical, in other cases it took additional work, but ultimately we were left with a well architected system that was free from legacy technical decisions.</p><p> 但是，在按组件迁移系统组件时，阻力最小的路径导致显示器的系统架构，这些架构看起来很像您的遗留系统。对于我们认为他们应该去的系统组件之间的边界来说，这对我们认为他们应该去的地方非常重要。在某些情况下，这是实用的，在其他情况下，它采取了额外的工作，但最终我们留下了一个良好的遗产系统，这些系统是没有遗留的技术决策。</p><p>       Man Numeric&#39;s migration to Python was a success. Having completed it, we are measurably reaping the benefits of increased agility and reduced time-to-market. But it was not an easy project; a company with fewer available resources, a less tenacious team, and without such fierce support and participation from the investment teams might not have succeeded. The strategies suggested above were not obvious from the outset, but learned by experience.</p><p>       人类数字＆＃39;迁移到Python是成功的。完成了它，我们正在衡量可敏捷性和减少上市时间增加的益处。但这不是一个简单的项目;一家拥有较少可用资源的公司，一个顽强的团队，没有这种激烈的支持和投资团队的参与可能没有成功。从一开始，上面提出的策略并不明显，而是通过经验学习。</p><p> Deciding to completely re-platform a mature company is a difficult decision for a business to make. The costs and risks are concrete and immediate, while the benefits are theoretical and have a real probability of never materialising. But if they do materialise, they can be completely transformative.</p><p> 决定完全重新平台一个成熟公司是一个难以做出的企业的决定。费用和风险是具体而立即的，而益处是理论并具有永不重要的概率。但如果他们确实实现了，它们可以完全转化。</p><p>  Readings that informed this post: &#34;Things you should Never Do&#34; by Joel Spolsky  https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/ &#34;The Myth of the Software Rewrite&#34; by Eric Deitrich  https://daedtech.com/the-myth-of-the-software-rewrite/ &#34;The best decision we&#39;ve made was to abandon a complete code rewrite&#34; by Tyler King  https://www.lessannoyingcrm.com/resources/code_rewrite_cautionary_tale &#34;We Decided to Rewrite Our Software.
