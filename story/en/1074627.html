Since then he&#39;s been busy — and his robotic arm  just landed a test gig flipping burgers in a White Castle restaurant in Chicago, reports Mashable: Since its unveiling in 2018, Flippy has cooked more than 40,000 pounds of fried food — including 9,000 sandwiches at LA&#39;s Dodger Stadium, the Arizona Diamondbacks&#39; Chase Field, and two CaliBurger locations, where it works alongside humans to increase productivity and consistency.   &#34;I think automation is here to stay and this is the first example of a really large credible player starting down that journey,&#34; Miso Robotics CEO Buck Jordan  told TechCrunch of the White Castle collab. Engineers are working to install the latest version of Flippy at an undisclosed location in Chicago, where the mechanical fry cook will be integrated into the restaurant&#39;s point-of-sale system, allowing it to get to work as soon as an order is placed. Customers in the Windy City can keep an eye out for Flippy starting in September.  That &#34;latest version&#34; is  named Flippy ROAR (Robot-on-a-Rail), according to  USA Today.   Citing a statement from White Castle, they report that &#34;The idea is to reduce human contact with food during the cooking process...&#34;</p><p>还记得因速度太慢而被解雇的烙汉堡机器人弗利皮吗？从那时起，他&#39；Mashable报道称，他一直很忙，他的机械臂刚刚在芝加哥的一家白城堡餐厅完成了一个测试性的汉堡翻转工作：自2018年面世以来，Flippy已经做了超过40000磅的油炸食品，包括LA&#39；s道奇体育场，亚利桑那响尾蛇#39；Chase Field和两个CaliBurger地点，它与人类一起工作，以提高生产力和一致性&#34;我认为自动化将继续存在，这是一家真正的大型可信公司开始这一旅程的第一个例子，&#34；味噌机器人首席执行官巴克·乔丹（Buck Jordan）向TechCrunch介绍了白城堡合作项目。工程师们正在芝加哥一个未公开的地点安装最新版本的Flippy，在那里，机械炒菜厨师将被整合到餐厅#39；s的销售点系统，允许它在下订单后立即开始工作。从9月份开始，风城的顾客可以密切关注Flippy。那&#34；最新版本&#34；根据《今日美国》的报道，它被命名为Flippy ROAR（Robot-on-a-Rail）。他们援引怀特城堡的一份声明称&#34；这个想法是为了减少人类在烹饪过程中与食物的接触&#34;</p><p>   It&#39;s not if it&#39;s when. And as the Corona Virus has shown putting restaurant workers out of a job wrecks our economy.    Trouble is nobody wants to pay people to stay home (the pandemic would be over if that was a thing here).    What are we doing to do with all these people who aren&#39;t needed? They&#39;re not smart enough to go back to school and become doctors. The wouldn&#39;t be fry cooks if they were.    As for the rich needing them to buy stuff, they don&#39;t really. Did the king need peasants to buy his products? When you already own everything you don&#39;t need to sell anything.    We&#39;ve got a few years to figure this shit out before it all collapses on us.</p><p>它&#39；如果不是&#39；什么时候。正如冠状病毒所显示的那样，让餐厅员工失业会破坏我们的经济。问题是没有人愿意付钱让人们呆在家里（如果这是一件事，大流行就会结束）。我们要怎么处理这些人&#39；不需要吗？他们&#39；你不够聪明，不能回到学校当医生。39岁；如果他们是油炸厨师，就别当他们。至于富人需要他们买东西，他们没有&#39；不是真的。国王需要农民来购买他的产品吗？当你已经拥有了你所不拥有的一切&#39；我不需要卖任何东西。我们&#39；我有几年的时间来搞清楚这件事。</p><p>   Fully agreed with everything except the &#34;they are not smart enough&#34;. I mean some maybe, Some fast food workers are working to dent in some of the bills while they are going to school, Some maybe can&#39;t afford to work, go to school and raise kids at the same time, and find school the only one they can put off. You are right about everything else. But there&#39;s a whole lot more barriers to going to school to become doctors, than just intelligence. If they had a crazy rich benefactor willing to pay for all their living expenses, childcare etc for the duration of their schooling, I&#39;d be willing to say most fry cooks probably could become something much better (Most not all, I&#39;m not denying the existence of people without potential, just saying I think there&#39;s far more people with potential without opportunity).</p><p>除&#34外，所有内容都完全同意；他们不够聪明；。我的意思是，一些可能，一些快餐工人在上学时正在努力削减一些账单，一些可能可以&#39；我负担不起工作、上学和抚养孩子，却发现学校是他们唯一可以推迟的学校。你在其他方面都是对的。但是有&#39；要想成为医生，上学的障碍远不止智力。如果他们有一个疯狂富有的捐助者愿意支付他们在上学期间的所有生活费用、儿童保育等，我&#39；我愿意说，大多数油炸厨师可能会变得更好（大多数不是全部，我并不否认没有潜力的人的存在，只是说我认为有更多的人有潜力而没有机会）。</p><p>   Please take a look at the distribution of basically any continuous characteristic in humans. The bell curve is real. There are a lot of dumb people out there. This isn&#39;t condescending. It&#39;s just the truth. It is cruel to tell these people they can be anything they put their mind to. It is insane to base policy on that notion. At least a third very likely can&#39;t. One in three people have an IQ of 92 or less. The average IQ associated with being an MD is 125. Only one in 20 people have an IQ of 125 or higher.</p><p>请看一下人类基本上任何连续特征的分布。钟形曲线是真实的。外面有很多哑巴。这不是&#39；不要居高临下。它&#39；这只是事实。告诉这些人他们可以随心所欲是残忍的。把政策建立在这种观念上是愚蠢的。至少有三分之一的人可以&#39；t、 三分之一的人智商不超过92。医学博士的平均智商是125。20个人中只有一个人的智商在125或更高。</p><p>   I didn&#39;t say specifically doctor, I said something better than they are, You don&#39;t think some middle managers, and random people at businesses aren&#39;t below average IQ. Yes there&#39;s people without potential to go above crap jobs, but there&#39;s quite a few dumb people in quite well paying jobs as well. Do you think wealthy people just all have superior genetics and their kids and that&#39;s why most of their kids are successful?</p><p>我没有&#39；不要特别说医生，我说了比他们更好的话，你不&#39；我不认为一些中层管理人员和企业中的随机人员是&#39；智商不低于平均水平。有&#39；有人没有潜力从事垃圾工作，但有&#39；有相当多的哑巴也在做报酬很高的工作。你认为富人都有优越的基因和他们的孩子吗；这就是为什么他们的大多数孩子都很成功？</p><p>   You don&#39;t base policy on the exception. Some people might succeed in spite of their innate (lack of) ability. Rich parents are a huge leg up. There are certainly lots of people who could do something better. But lots more couldn&#39;t. There is always going to be a big chunk of the population with just enough cognitive ability to hold a supervised job that consists of mostly repetitive labour. I&#39;m not trying to make it look like their value as human beings depends on their IQ. Quite the opposite. Policy needs t</p><p>你没有&#39；我们不能把政策建立在例外的基础上。有些人可能会成功，尽管他们天生（缺乏）能力。有钱的父母是个大人物。当然有很多人可以做得更好。但更多的人不能&#39；t、 总有很大一部分人的认知能力刚好足以胜任一份由重复劳动组成的监督工作。我&#39；我不想让人觉得他们的价值取决于他们的智商。恰恰相反。政策需要</p><p> You may have missed the 8 years of the Obama administration- terrorists, drug dealers, and corrupt politicians loves that era.</p><p>你可能已经错过了奥巴马政府的8年——恐怖分子、毒贩和腐败政客都喜欢那个时代。</p><p> Bullshit. Brains has zero to do with getting ahead in the USA. Working hard has zero to do with getting ahead in the USA. Its all about who you know, and who you blow. And no, not everybody has equal opportunities despite the last 40 YEARS of right wing propaganda. Absolute bullshit.</p><p>瞎扯。在美国，大脑与获得成功无关。在美国，努力工作与获得成功无关。一切都是关于你认识谁，你喜欢谁。不，尽管过去40年的右翼宣传，并不是每个人都有平等的机会。绝对是胡说八道。</p><p>   Don&#39;t apply your survivorship bias to the rest of us. Nothing correlates with a person&#39;s income so closely as their father&#39;s income, explain that.</p><p>唐&#39；不要把你对生存的偏见应用到我们其他人身上。没有什么与一个人相关&#39；他们的收入和他们的父亲一样高#39；这是我的收入，解释一下。</p><p>   Besides the advantage of actually having a father? According to some statistics, 85% of all incarcerated children come from fatherless homes. It&#39;s one of the strongest factors contributing to young black men in prison, as best I can tell stronger than tested IQ and parental income.</p><p>除了有个父亲的好处？根据一些统计数据，85%的被监禁儿童来自无父家庭。它&#39；这是导致年轻黑人男子入狱的最主要因素之一，据我所知，这比经过测试的智商和父母收入更重要。</p><p>   Yes, I answered your question. If anything, being the child of a single parent is one of the greatest causes of childhood poverty. Since 80% of single parents are mothers, it&#39;s also mostly single mothers raising children alone. Other consequences include the greater rates of suicide, alcoholism, abuse, and drug dependency for these children, all of which are _causes_ of poverty.</p><p>是的，我回答了你的问题。如果说有什么区别的话，单亲家庭的孩子是导致儿童贫困的最大原因之一。由于80%的单亲父母都是母亲，因此它&#39；大多数单身母亲独自抚养孩子。其他后果包括这些儿童自杀、酗酒、虐待和药物依赖的比率更高，所有这些都是贫困的原因。</p><p>   No you didn&#39;t, this was accounted for, and coming from a single-parent household is only the second most closely correlated factor, after income:</p><p>不，你没有&#39；t、 这是有原因的，来自单亲家庭只是第二个最密切相关的因素，仅次于收入：</p><p> It&#39;s not if it&#39;s when. And as the Corona Virus has shown putting restaurant workers out of a job wrecks our economy.</p><p>它&#39；如果不是&#39；什么时候。正如冠状病毒所显示的那样，让餐厅员工失业会破坏我们的经济。</p><p> Do you seriously not understand the difference between putting restaurant workers out of a job and closing down all restaurants? Do you equate shutting down the economy and casting 20 million workers off their jobs the same as automating a menial task in a fast food restaurant?</p><p>你真的不明白让餐厅员工失业和关闭所有餐厅之间的区别吗？你是否将关闭经济、解雇2000万工人等同于在快餐店自动化一项卑微的工作？</p><p> Our Covid-19 response showed us what happens to the economy when you shut it down Across the board, we didn&#39;t just shutdown restaurants.</p><p>我们的2019冠状病毒疾病反应显示了当经济完全关闭时，我们的经济状况如何，我们没有39。不要只是关闭餐馆。</p><p> Taking an employee off the grill results in one lost job per shift per restaurant, period.</p><p>让一名员工离开烤架会导致每家餐厅每班损失一份工作。</p><p>   Do people not understand the difference between digging a footing by hand and doing it with a back hoe. The difference is back breaking work in the hot sun, day in and day out, really fucking hard labour.</p><p>人们不明白用手挖地基和用反铲挖地基的区别吗。区别在于日复一日地在烈日下辛苦工作，真他妈的辛苦。</p><p> Why the fuck would anyone force anyone to do work when it can be automated the idea is all sorts of psychopathically insane.</p><p>为什么他妈的会有人强迫任何人去做可以自动化的工作这个想法简直是精神错乱。</p><p> You automate more, so people can fucking work less, that is the whole fucking idea, not some insane you must make workers work or starve them to death as being useless insanity. We s</p><p>你可以实现更多的自动化，这样人们就可以他妈的少工作，这就是他妈的整个想法，而不是一些疯子你必须让工人工作，或者把他们饿死，因为这是无用的疯子。我们是</p><p> A sudden shock that puts many people out of work at once is bad for the economy.</p><p>突然的冲击会让很多人同时失业，这对经济不利。</p><p>  Productivity improvements not only grow the economy and increase living standards, they are the ONLY thing that does so.</p><p>生产力的提高不仅促进了经济增长和生活水平的提高，而且也是唯一能做到这一点的因素。</p><p> Prior to Covid, unemployment was at historic lows and businesses reported that their biggest problem was a shortage of labor.</p><p>在新冠肺炎之前，失业率处于历史最低水平，企业报告称，他们最大的问题是劳动力短缺。</p><p> No, paying ppl below minimum wage AND THEN laying off ppl is what hurts the economy.  When these restaurants move towards more automation AND we start paying Americans a LIVABLE wage, then we will see more $ injected into our economy.</p><p>不，支付低于最低工资的ppl，然后解雇ppl是损害经济的因素。当这些餐馆走向更自动化，我们开始给美国人支付一份宜居的工资时，我们将看到更多的美元注入我们的经济。</p><p>  And as the Corona Virus has shown putting restaurant workers out of a job wrecks our economy.</p><p>正如冠状病毒所显示的那样，让餐厅员工失业会破坏我们的经济。</p><p> It doesn&#39;t &#34;wreck&#34; our economy. It changes it. Just like the steam engine, and the telegraph, and automatic telephone switching equipment, and every other advance in productivity changed it. There will be people who will not be doing the same job they were doing before.

A grilled burger, the fats drip off and flame up, so having a grill that can be flipped over for a robot works fine.</p><p>它&#39；这就是煎汉堡和烤汉堡的区别。一个烤制的汉堡，脂肪会滴落下来燃烧起来，所以有一个可以为机器人翻转的烤架就可以了。</p><p> A fried burger however, the burger cooks in its own fats. So you need to flip it so it cooks evenly. You can&#39;t fry a burger on both sides at the same time. That is why you need a burger flipping robot.</p><p>然而，油炸汉堡是用自己的脂肪烹制的。所以你需要翻转它，让它均匀地烹饪。你可以&#39；Don’不要同时煎汉堡的两面。这就是为什么你需要一个卖汉堡的机器人。</p><p>   There&#39;s no reason an automated grill in an assembly line type setup can&#39;t have a mechanism to flip and press the patty vs being a double grill/oven.</p><p>那里&#39；没有理由在装配线类型设置中的自动烤架可以&#39；与双烤架/烤箱相比，我们没有翻转和按压肉饼的机制。</p><p> Just looking at the picture tells me that the robot is very inefficent at this task.</p><p>只看这张照片就知道机器人在这项任务上效率很低。</p><p>   Just looking at the picture tells me that the robot is very inefficent at this task.</p><p>只看这张照片就知道机器人在这项任务上效率很低。</p><p>  But a design criterion for many robots is that they be roll-in replacements for humans.

Which is even a bit more of a particular cooking process. I&#39;m sure the process could be automated, but a robot allows usage in a traditionally equipped restaurant and cooking it the same manner. Also the kitchen still works without the busted robot.</p><p>我&#39；我对怀特城堡的粉丝不太熟悉，但事实证明他们在洋葱床上蒸汉堡馅饼。这更像是一个特殊的烹饪过程。我&#39；我相信这个过程可以自动化，但机器人允许在传统设备齐全的餐厅使用，并以同样的方式烹饪。此外，厨房在没有坏掉的机器人的情况下仍然可以工作。</p><p> Why not use a conveyer belt oven like many places already do?

Businesses do bait and switch all the time with menu pics.</p><p>嘿，这给了我一个主意。买一个煎饼，把它放在你的商店橱窗里，但卖传送带烤制的汉堡。商家总是通过菜单图片来诱饵和切换。</p><p> Because we think people should be able to afford basic rent on working 40 hours... Companies are going to replace workers with machines as soon as it&#39;s economically viable. Running a machine costs the company what? 20 cents of electricity an hour? Throw in the average of maintenance etc... we can ballpark it up to 1.50 or so. Doesn&#39;t matter if we pay people $2 an hour, $15 an hour. It&#39;s still a question of when the machines will be ready to take their jobs, not if. Reality if you are flipping burgers, you N</p><p>因为我们认为人们应该能够在工作40小时后支付基本租金。。。公司将尽快用机器取代工人&#39；这在经济上是可行的。运行一台机器要花多少钱？每小时20美分的电费？再加上平均维护费用等。。。我们可以大致估计到1.50左右。不&#39；如果我们付给人们每小时2美元，每小时15美元，这并不重要。它&#39；这仍然是一个机器何时准备好工作的问题，而不是如果。现实如果你在烙汉堡，你会发现</p><p>   A job is better than NO job. Rent is also dictated by the market, being priced at what the market will bear. This will be proven in the next 6-12 months as housing/rent prices collapse. The artificial inflation of wages for unskilled labor only kept rents high, along with the artificial scarcity created by over-regulation preventing new supply from coming online.</p><p>有工作总比没有工作好。租金也由市场决定，按市场承受的价格定价。随着住房/租金价格暴跌，这一点将在未来6-12个月得到证明。非熟练劳动力工资的人为通胀只会让租金居高不下，同时过度监管导致了人为稀缺，阻止了新的供应上线。</p><p>   A job to be a job needs to be something that pays enough for the person to be able to live on it, otherwise it is just a temporary position of high turnover or semi-slavery. And is it serious that you still believe in this &#34;market forces&#34; fairy tale?</p><p>一份工作要成为一份工作，就必须有足够的收入让人能够靠它生活，否则它只是一个高流动性或半奴役性的临时职位。你还相信这个#34；市场力量&#34；童话故事</p><p>   Pay is determined by the difficulty in filling the position. A job anyone can do, including teens and the elderly who don&#39;t need as much money as a person in their 20s or 30s or 40s, isn&#39;t going to pay a whole lot because a 16 year old already has his basic needs met and an elderly person has social security. Pay is not determined by the salary needs of the work but by the requirements of the position. And, if the job can be done just as well by a machine that works all day without breaks for less than it</p><p>工资是由填补这个职位的难度决定的。一份任何人都能做的工作，包括青少年和没有&#39；你不需要像20多岁、30多岁或40多岁的人那样多的钱，是不是&#39；I don’我不会花很多钱，因为一个16岁的人已经有了基本的需要，一个老年人有了社会保障。薪酬不是由工作的薪资需求决定的，而是由职位的要求决定的。而且，如果工作可以通过一台全天不间断工作的机器来完成，并且花费比它少的时间</p><p>   You didn&#39;t get the point. If the work does not pay enough for you to make a living, it becomes a problem for both the employee and the employer. For example, imagine that you are the owner of the restaurant and you have got a &#34;hamburger flipper&#34; that is  really good at what he does. It is in your interest to keep this employee, but if what he gets paid is insufficient to pay the basic expenses he will leave the first opportunity that appears of a better paid job, and you as an employer end up with a high tur</p><p>你没有&#39；我不明白重点。如果工作报酬不足以让你维持生计，这对雇员和雇主来说都是一个问题。例如，假设你是餐厅的老板，你有一个&#34；汉堡包翻页&#34；他真的很在行。留住这名员工符合你的利益，但如果他获得的工资不足以支付基本费用，他将离开第一个薪酬更高的工作机会，而你作为雇主最终会获得更高的tur</p><p>   Nope. It only becomes a problem for the employee because if the job is paying that low, anyone can do the job because anyone is doing the job. The problem is ANYONE can be an expert burger-flipper and be really good at it because THAT IS THE ACTUAL CASE. More importantly, the jobs you are complaining about don&#39;t require someone who is &#34;really good&#34; at flipping burgers. It just needs someone who can flip the burgers. You are trying to say that a job that doesn&#39;t need expertise should pay people for unneeded</p><p>不。这只会成为员工的问题，因为如果工作报酬那么低，任何人都可以做这项工作，因为任何人都在做这项工作。问题是，任何人都可以成为专业的烙牛肉饼者，而且非常擅长，因为事实就是如此。更重要的是，你在抱怨唐&#39；不需要34岁的人；真的很好&#34；在烙汉堡的时候。它只需要能翻转汉堡的人。你想说的是一份不需要&#39；不需要专业知识的人应该为不需要的东西付钱</p><p>   You again failed to see the point. And I suspect that you will  forever fail to understand what the point is.   I think that you focus too much on the example without being able to understand  the example is just an example. The problem that this example is trying to demonstrate is that if the job pays so little that a person has no way of living doing that job then it is not really a job (in Brazil we call this type of thing &#34;bico&#34;).   And even worse, you fail badly thinking that &#34;anyone&#34; can do even this jo</p><p>你又一次看不到重点。我怀疑你会永远无法理解这一点。我认为你过于关注这个例子，而无法理解这个例子只是一个例子。这个例子试图说明的问题是，如果这份工作报酬太低，以至于一个人没有办法活下去，那么它就不是一份真正的工作（在巴西，我们称之为&#34；比科&#34；）。更糟糕的是，你认为&#34；任何人&#34；我甚至能胜任这份工作</p><p>   I have done the job. I have worked in fast food. I have worked as a line cook in a restaurant. I have worked as a prep cook in a restaurant. It is really cute that you think cooking for your family is like working in a restaurant. It shows you are clueless and just talking out of your ass..</p><p>我已经完成了任务。我在快餐店工作过。我在一家餐馆当过厨师。我曾在一家餐馆当过预备厨师。你觉得为家人做饭就像在餐馆工作，这真的很可爱。这表明你毫无头绪，只是在胡说八道。。</p><p> This is what I was talking about. That may be how it works when you are cooking for your family, but that is not how it works in restaurants, especially fast food restaurants that pay low wag</p><p>这就是我说的。当你为家人做饭时，这可能就是它的工作原理，但在餐馆里，尤其是支付低工资的快餐店里，这不是它的工作原理</p><p>   Don&#39;t try to lie to me lol... If you really knew how it is not simple we would not even have this conversation. You just took some data from your butt and from Internet, when the very way you treat the subject shows that you don&#39;t understand what the problem is and will never understand.   Pathetic.</p><p>唐&#39；别想骗我哈哈。。。如果你真的知道这是多么不简单，我们甚至不会有这样的对话。你只是从你的屁股和互联网上获取了一些数据，而你对待这个问题的方式表明你没有&#39；我不明白问题是什么，也永远不会明白。可怜的</p><p> The best you can do against my 6 years experience in the restaurant industry is call me a liar while being unable to refute anything I said because it all checks out. Congratulations on proving you are a clueless child and that you know you have nothing to stand on. You have lost this debate and proved you are both ignorant and arrogant.</p><p>根据我在餐饮业6年的经验，你能做的最好的事情就是说我是个骗子，同时又无法反驳我说的任何话，因为这一切都是事实。恭喜你证明你是一个无知的孩子，你知道你没有什么可以依靠的。你输掉了这场辩论，证明了你既无知又傲慢。</p><p> Was this comment written from 2019? Coronaviris killed off most restaurant jobs already... (And even those that found some way to reopen are eventually going to shut down again in Coronavirus Wave 2.)</p><p>这篇评论是2019年写的吗？冠状病毒已经杀死了大多数餐馆的工作。。。（即使是那些找到某种方式重新开放的公司，最终也会在冠状病毒第二波中再次关闭。）</p><p>   well Im thinking more fastfood restraunts, of which are still as alive and well as they can be... but at that I&#39;d also agree with you, corona is also going to create a new push in automation we&#39;ve never seen. We&#39;ve just seen a new &#34;con&#34; added to human workers (they might be forced not to work in a quarantine). Imagine what a killing a restraunt could be making if they managed to get almost purely automated, order in an app, pick up in a drive thru system.</p><p>嗯，我在想更多的快餐店，它们仍然活着，而且尽可能地健康。。。但我&#39；我也同意你的看法，科罗纳也将在自动化领域创造一个新的推动力，我们&#39；我从没见过。我们&#39；我刚刚看到一个新的&#34；con和#34；增加了人类工人（他们可能被迫不在隔离区工作）。想象一下，如果一个洗手间的阿姨能做到几乎完全自动化，在应用程序中下单，在免下车系统中取车，那会是一个多么大的杀戮。</p><p> The problem is that people have to &#39;burger flip&#39; when going through college, and even once you have that degree in your hand, you won&#39;t be landing that high paying job right away. It might take years, or it may not happen at all.</p><p>问题是人们不得不&#39；汉堡卷&#39；大学毕业时，即使你拿到了学位，你也会赢&#39；我不能马上得到那份高薪的工作。这可能需要数年时间，也可能根本不会发生。</p><p> There needs to be &#39;fall back&#39; jobs in case your dream does not pan out.</p><p>需要&#39；退后&#39；工作，以防你的梦想无法实现。</p><p>   The problem is... the fall back jobs, are more and more decorative as time goes on. Why IMO UBI is a fast approaching necessity. Bottom line is tech is fast approaching the point where it&#39;s replacing anyone that isn&#39;t purely creative. At the very least it&#39;s going to cut the amount of work in half. I mean we can rig up exercise bikes for them to push to call it &#34;working&#34;, but in the end, keeping these low wage jobs around, is purely cosmetic for our own sense of &#34;if you aren&#39;t working to bring money into a c</p><p>问题是。。。随着时间的推移，后备工作越来越具有装饰性。为什么IMO UBI是一种快速接近的必要性。归根结底，科技正在迅速接近它的极限&#39；它将取代任何一个不在&#39；这不是纯粹的创意。至少它&#39；It’我们将把工作量减半。我的意思是，我们可以装配健身自行车，让他们推它，称之为&#34；工作&#34；，但归根结底，保留这些低薪工作纯粹是为了满足我们自身的&#34；如果你不是&#39；I don’我不想把钱带进c</p><p> Because we think people should be able to afford basic rent on working 40 hours</p><p>因为我们认为人们应该能够在工作40小时的情况下支付基本租金</p><p> Then, they should get a job that pays enough to afford basic rent &#34;on working 40 hours&#34;.</p><p>然后，他们应该找到一份薪水足够支付基本租金的工作#34；工作40小时&#34；。</p><p> No, seriously. They need to stop fucking off in school, dropping out of school, dealing drugs, abusing drugs, getting arrested for felonies, not showing up for work, acting like a rude fuckwit, all of which lead to being unable to get a job that pays a decent wage.</p><p>不，说真的。他们需要停止在学校放学、辍学、贩毒、吸毒、因重罪被捕、不上班、表现得像个粗鲁的混蛋，所有这些都会导致他们找不到一份薪水不错的工作。</p><p> I have seen people walk out from a good paying job opportunity because they wouldn&#39;t take a piss test for drugs because they smoke pot and they won&#39;t stop sm</p><p>我见过人们放弃高薪工作机会，因为他们不愿意&#39；不要做尿检，因为他们吸大麻，而且他们赢了&#39；不要阻止sm</p><p> You morons have been saying this since the minimum wage was instituted, and every hike was going to cause the end of low wage unskilled labor. How many times have you been right? Zero Zip Nada Zilch Nyet Null Ninguno</p><p>你们这些白痴自从最低工资制度建立以来就一直这么说，每次提高工资都会导致低工资非熟练劳动力的终结。你有多少次是对的？Zero Zip Nada Zillch Nyet Null Ninguno</p><p> Automation happens when mechanized efficiency exceeds that of a human, labor cost is only a minor component of that equation. Do you think that coal mines are automated because miners were getting paid too much? No, it&#39;s because no matter how many people you put in the hole they couldn&#39;t produce as</p><p>自动化发生在机械化效率超过人力时，劳动力成本只是这个等式的一小部分。你认为煤矿自动化是因为矿工的工资太高吗？不，它是&#39；因为不管你把多少人放进洞里，他们都不能&#39；不生产</p><p> White Castle did a lot of testing decades ago to create a burger that doesn&#39;t need flipping while cooking. About the only place the robot would be an advantage is placing the burgers, onions, and buns on the grill.</p><p>怀特城堡在几十年前做了很多测试，以制造出一种不&#39；烹饪时不需要翻动。机器人唯一的优势就是把汉堡、洋葱和面包放在烤架上。</p><p>   That or just picking up the burger/onion/top bun set up from the grill and setting it on the bun bases.</p><p>或者只是从烤架上拿起汉堡/洋葱/顶部的小面包，放在小面包的底部。</p><p> I used to work at a White Castle clone named Castleburger in Florida a long long time ago.</p><p>很久以前，我曾在佛罗里达州一家名为卡斯特伯格的白色城堡克隆公司工作。</p><p> Yeah, I thought that everybody knew that White Castle doesn&#39;t flip their burgers. That&#39;s why the wafer-thin patties have five holes in them; it helps to let them cook through from one side.</p><p>是的，我以为大家都知道白城堡没有&#39；别把他们的汉堡翻过来。那&#39；这就是为什么薄饼上有五个洞；让他们从一边煮着吃会有帮助。</p><p> It just doesn&#39;t make sense to name a White Castl</p><p>只是没有&#39；给一个白色城堡起名是没有意义的</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/机器人/">#机器人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/城堡/">#城堡</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/castle/">#castle</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
