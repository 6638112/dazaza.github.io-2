", "note_en": "Western Digital, maker of the popular My Disk external hard drives, is recommending customers unplug their devices from the Internet until further notice while company engineers investigate unexplained compromises that have completely wiped data from devices around the world.\n The mass incidents of disk wiping came to light in  this thread on Western Digital\u2019s support forum. So far, there are no reports of deleted data later being restored.\n  \u201cI have a WD mybook live connected to my home LAN and worked fine for years,\u201d the person starting the thread wrote. \u201cI have just found that somehow all the data on it is gone today, while the directories seems there but empty. Previously the 2T volume was almost full but now it shows full capacity.\u201d\n Other My Book users quickly joined the conversation to report they, too, had experienced precisely the same thing. \u201cAll my data is gone too,\u201d one user soon responded. \u201cI am totally screwed without that data... years of it.\u201d\n Multiple users reported that the data loss coincided with a factory reset that was performed on their devices. One person posted a log that showed unexplained behavior occurring on Wednesday:\n Jun 23 15:14:05 MyBookLive factoryRestore.sh: begin script: Jun 23 15:14:05 MyBookLive shutdown[24582]: shutting down for system reboot Jun 23 16:02:26 MyBookLive S15mountDataVolume.sh: begin script: start Jun 23 16:02:29 MyBookLive _: pkg: wd-nas Jun 23 16:02:30 MyBookLive _: pkg: networking-general Jun 23 16:02:30 MyBookLive _: pkg: apache-php-webdav Jun 23 16:02:31 MyBookLive _: pkg: date-time Jun 23 16:02:31 MyBookLive _: pkg: alerts Jun 23 16:02:31 MyBookLive logger: hostname=MyBookLive Jun 23 16:02:32 MyBookLive _: pkg: admin-rest-api\n \u201cI believe this is the culprit of why this happens,\u201d the person wrote. \u201cNo one was even home to use this drive at this time.\u201d\n    The My Book is a popular storage device for consumers and businesses. It plugs into computers, typically through USB, but it can also be accessed remotely so users can access data or make configuration changes. My Book devices use the My Book Live cloud service to provide remote access. The support forum thread was  first reported by Bleeping Computer.\n  On its website, Western Digital  advised customers to disconnect their My Books to prevent further attacks while the company investigates the mass wiping.\n  The incident is under active investigation from Western Digital. We do not have any indications of a breach or compromise of Western Digital cloud services or systems.\n We have determined that some My Book Live devices have been compromised by a threat actor. In some cases, this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device. The My Book Live device received its final firmware update in 2015.\n At this time, we are recommending that customers disconnect their My Book Live devices from the Internet to protect their data on the device.\n We have issued the following statement to our customers and will provide updates to this thread when they are available:  https://community.wd.com/t/action-required-on-my-book-live-and-my-book-live-duo/268147\n The limited amount of information available at the moment makes it hard to determine what\u2019s causing this mass data destruction.

These were not shots fired by invading troops, but by American GIs against their own military police.\n Intrigued by his discovery, Clinton Smith, the black British maintenance worker who discovered the holes in the woodwork, asked locals how they could have got there. He was told that they were the remnants of the Battle of Bamber Bridge, when black American troops stationed in the town faced off against white US Army military police on the night of June 24-25, 1943.\n More a mutiny than a battle, it led to the death of Private William Crossland in nearby Mounsey Road, and four other injuries to black American soldiers in a five-hour confrontation which spread from the thatched Olde Hob Inn at one end of the town to the Adams Hall army camp, where from early 1943 the US Eighth Army Quartermaster Truck Company, a black company apart from a few white officers, had been based. The event was officially downplayed, in order not to undermine morale on the home front, but the events of that night led to the conviction of 27 black American soldiers.\n  The whole incident is typical of the clashes on and around bases in Britain between black and white American troops \u2013  44 between November 1943 and February 1944 alone \u2013 where the intrinsic racism in a segregated army led to confrontations. This was especially the case in a foreign setting where the black soldiers saw around them a very different reality from that they faced at home \u2013 a non-segregated society where they were welcomed as fellow fighters against fascism, rather than tolerated hod-carriers for the war effort as they were generally treated by the US Army.\n  That evening in 1943, black troops and white locals were stretching out \u201cdrinking-up time\u201d in a pub at the end of the evening. Words were exchanged, and military police arrived and tried to arrest Private Eugene Nunn for not wearing the proper uniform. But they faced new solidarities: a white British soldier challenged the military police: \u201cWhy do you want to arrest them? They\u2019re not doing anything or bothering anybody.\u201d\n The incident escalated into a fist fight and the military police were beaten back. When they returned with reinforcements to meet the group, now returning to camp, a battle developed in the street. Shots were fired, and Crossland died with a bullet in his back.\n  When rumours spread at the camp that black GIs had been shot, scores of men formed a crowd, some carrying rifles. The arrival at around midnight of more military police with a machine gun-equipped vehicle convinced many of the black soldiers that the police intended to kill them \u2013 and they drew rifles from the stores. Some barricaded themselves into the base, others tore off back into town, leading to running shooting battles in the streets.\n Many of the black American troop standing up to the military police that febrile night were no doubt influenced by news filtering through of race riots in Detroit on June 20, where defenceless black men were attacked by racist police, responsible for the deaths of 17 of the 25 African-Americans killed.\n  In his essays George Orwell alluded to the oft-quoted assertion that American GIs were \u201coversexed, overpaid and over here\u201d. But he qualified this with the observation that: \u201cthe general consensus of opinion is that the only American soldiers with decent manners are Negroes.\u201d\n The black American servicemen were welcomed into the leisure time of their British hosts in ways that spread solidarity. A former black GI, Cleother Hathcock, remembers:\n At that time the Jitterbug was in and the blacks would get a buggin\u2019 and the English just loved that. We would go into a dance hall and just take over the place because everybody wanted to learn how to do that American dance, the Jitterbug. They went wild over that.\n The town did not share the US Army\u2019s segregationist attitudes. According to the author Anthony Burgess, who spent time in Bamber Bridge during the war, when US military authorities demanded that the town\u2019s pubs impose a colour bar, the  landlords responded with signs that read: \u201cBlack Troops Only\u201d. The extent to which this rankled the white American troops is shown by the comments of a lieutenant:\n One thing I noticed here and which I don\u2019t like is the fact that the English don\u2019t draw any color line. The English must be pretty ignorant. I can\u2019t see how a white girl could associate with a negro.\n This sort of attitude exemplifies the particular resentment over the way black troops openly fraternised with white British women \u2013 and many of the confrontations during this period were sparked by the  ease of interracial relationships in a British rather than American context.\n The military authorities tried to push back against this by imposing Jim Crow segregation in Britain, so that when the black American  world heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis visited on a propaganda tour in 1944 he encountered blatant discrimination from the troops he was visiting,  as he had at home.\n The events in Bamber Bridge encapsulated these Jim Crow practices \u2013 and the wider paradox of the open-armed welcome from the local residents coupled with resentment of that welcome by white American troops. The pub was a place of sanctuary for black troops where they mingled with, mainly friendly, locals, and where the segregation many had to endure in the American South was thankfully absent.\n Local resident Gillian Vesey recalled how, as a young barmaid at the Olde Hob Inn, she stood up for African American soldiers against attempts by white Americans to impose discriminatory practices in the pub, insisting that the American white soldiers wait their turn rather than expecting to be served before their black colleagues.\n Keeping a segregated army in the context of fighting for democracy became untenable, and in 1948 the then US president Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981 which eventually led to an integrated army. While the convictions of the troops involved at Bamber Bridge were largely commuted or overturned, soldiers returned to Jim Crow segregation in the US, with the reality that  some veterans were lynched in their uniforms.\n But the new freedoms they experienced in Europe meant they were not prepared to put up with discrimination, racism and racial violence again. As veteran Wilford Strange said in the documentary film  Choc\u2019late Soldiers from the USA:\n I think the impact these soldiers had by volunteering was the initiation of the Civil Rights movement, \u2019cos these soldiers were never going back to be discriminated against again.

That\u2019s about 0.1%.\n And only about 150 of the more than 18,000 COVID-19 deaths in May were in fully vaccinated people. That translates to about 0.8%, or five deaths per day on average.\n The AP analyzed figures provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC itself has not estimated what percentage of hospitalizations and deaths are in fully vaccinated people, citing limitations in the data.\n  Among them: Only about 45 states report breakthrough infections, and some are more aggressive than others in looking for such cases. So the data probably understates such infections, CDC officials said.\n Still, the overall trend that emerges from the data echoes what many health care authorities are seeing around the country and what top experts are saying.\n Earlier this month, Andy Slavitt, a former adviser to the Biden administration on COVID-19, suggested that 98% to 99% of the Americans dying of the coronavirus are unvaccinated.\n And CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Tuesday that the vaccine is so effective that \u201cnearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19, is, at this point, entirely preventable.\u201d She called such deaths \u201cparticularly tragic.\u201d\n Deaths in the U.S. have plummeted from a peak of more than 3,400 day on average in mid-January, one month into the vaccination drive.\n About 63% of all vaccine-eligible Americans \u2014 those 12 and older \u2014 have received at least one dose, and 53% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. While vaccine remains scarce in much of the world, the U.S. supply is so abundant and demand has slumped so dramatically that shots sit unused.\n Ross Bagne, a 68-year-old small-business owner in Cheyenne, Wyoming, was eligible for the vaccine in early February but didn\u2019t get it. He died June 4, infected and unvaccinated, after spending more than three weeks in the hospital, his lungs filling with fluid. He was unable to swallow because of a stroke.\n \u201cHe never went out, so he didn\u2019t think he would catch it,\u201d said his grieving sister, Karen McKnight. She wondered: \u201cWhy take the risk of not getting vaccinated?\u201d\n The preventable deaths will continue, experts predict, with unvaccinated pockets of the nation experiencing outbreaks in the fall and winter. Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, said modeling suggests the nation will hit 1,000 deaths per day again next year.\n  In Arkansas, which has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with only about 33% of the population fully protected, cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising.\n \u201cIt is sad to see someone go to the hospital or die when it can be prevented,\u201d Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted as he urged people to get their shots.\n In Seattle\u2019s King County, the public health department found only three deaths during a recent 60-day period in people who were fully vaccinated. The rest, some 95% of 62 deaths, had had no vaccine or just one shot.\n \u201cThose are all somebody\u2019s parents, grandparents, siblings and friends,\u201d said Dr. Mark Del Beccaro, who helps lead a vaccination outreach program in King County. \u201cIt\u2019s still a lot of deaths, and they\u2019re preventable deaths.\u201d\n In the St. Louis area, more than 90% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been vaccinated, said Dr. Alex Garza, a hospital administrator who directs a metropolitan-area task force on the outbreak.\n \u201cThe majority of them express some regret for not being vaccinated,\u201d Garza said. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty common refrain that we\u2019re hearing from patients with COVID.\u201d\n The stories of unvaccinated people dying may convince some people they should get the shots, but young adults \u2014 the group least likely to be vaccinated \u2014 may be motivated more by a desire to protect their loved ones, said David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington University\u2019s school of public health in the nation\u2019s capital.\n Others need paid time off to get the shots and deal with any side effects, Michaels said.\n The Occupational Safety and Health Administration this month began requiring health care employers, including hospitals and nursing homes, to provide such time off. But Michaels, who headed OSHA under President Barack Obama, said the agency should have gone further and applied the rule to meat and poultry plants and other food operations as well as other places with workers at risk.\n Bagne, who lived alone, ran a business helping people incorporate their companies in Wyoming for the tax advantages. He was winding down the business, planning to retire, when he got sick, emailing his sister in April about an illness that had left him dizzy and disoriented.\n \u201cWhatever it was.

No software or web platform out there is going to reach into the middle of the river and pull out a liter of water.\n But with the advent of drones powerful and reliable enough to deploy in professional and industrial circumstances, the situation has changed. Nixie is a solution by the drone specialists at Reign Maker, involving either a custom-built sample collection arm or an in-situ sensor arm.\n  The sample collector is basically a long vertical arm with a locking cage for a sample container. You put the empty container in there, fly the drone out to the location, then submerge the arm. When it flies back, the filled container can be taken out while the drone hovers and a fresh one put in its place to bring to the next spot. (This switch can be done safely in winds up to 18 MPH and sampling in currents up to 5 knots, the company said.)\n  This allows for quick sampling at multiple locations \u2014 the drone\u2019s battery will last about 20 minutes, enough for two to four samples depending on the weather and distance. Swap the battery out and drive to the next location and do it all again.\n For comparison, Reign Maker pointed to New York\u2019s water authority, which collects 30 samples per day from boats and other methods, at an approximate cost (including labor, boat fuel, etc) of $100 per sample. Workers using Nixie were able to collect an  average of 120 samples per day, for around $10 each. Sure, New York is probably among the higher cost locales for this (like everything else) but the deltas are pretty huge. (The dipper attachment itself costs $850, but doesn\u2019t come with a drone.)\n It should be mentioned that the drone is not operating autonomously; it has a pilot who will be flying with line of sight (which simplifies regulations and requirements). But even so, that means a team of two, with a handful of spare batteries, can cover the same space\u00a0 that would normally take a boat crew and more than a little fuel. Currently the system works with the M600 and M300 RTK drones from DJI.\n  The drone method has the added benefits of having precise GPS locations for each sample and of not disturbing the water when it dips in. No matter how carefully you step or pilot a boat, you\u2019re going to be pushing the water all over the place, potentially affecting the contents of the sample, but that\u2019s not the case if you\u2019re hovering overhead.\n In development is  a smarter version of the sampler that includes a set of sensors that can do on-site testing for all the most common factors: temperature, pH, troubling organisms, various chemicals. Skipping the step of bringing the water back to a lab for testing streamlines the process immensely, as you might expect.\n Right now Reign Maker is working with New York\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection and in talks with other agencies. While the system would take some initial investment, training, and getting used to, it\u2019s probably hard not to be tempted by the possibility of faster  and cheaper testing.\n Ultimately the company hopes to offer (in keeping with the zeitgeist) a more traditional SaaS offering involving water quality maps updating in real time with new testing. That too is still in the drawing-board phase, but once a few customers sign up it starts looking a lot more attractive.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 06:07:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a,drone", "title": "Nixie\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6c34\u62bd\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u62ef\u6551\u57ce\u5e02\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u91d1\u94b1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tNixie\u2019s drone-based water sampling could save cities time and money\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/nixies-drone-based-water-sampling-could-save-cities-time-and-money/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e0\u4eba\u673a", "drone"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c2b0f063c382f7802937e34f5e8048ed.jpg", "infoid": 1068127, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u73b0\u5728\u5fae\u8f6f\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86Windows 11\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u5b89\u88c5\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u786e\u8ba4\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u4e0a\u5468\u6cc4\u6f0f\u4e2d\u62c9\u52a8\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u8fd0\u884c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a64\u4f4dCPU\uff08\u6216SOC\uff09\uff0c4GB\u7684RAM\u548c64GB\u5b58\u50a8\uff0cSPECS\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8eWindows 10\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8fd9\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u65e7\u768432\u4f4d\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u7684Windows\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b83\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c32\u4f4d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002\n \u627e\u51fa\u60a8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406Windows 11\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e0b\u8f7dMicrosoft\u7684PC Health App\uff08\u70b9\u51fb\u6b64\u5904\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u544a\u8bc9\u60a8\u60a8\u7684\u89c4\u683c\u548c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u662f\u5426\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n  \u5904\u7406\u5668\uff1a1 GigaHertz\uff08GHz\uff09\u6216\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5728\u517c\u5bb9\u768464\u4f4d\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6216\u82af\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u67092\u4e2a\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u6838\u5fc3\uff08SOC\uff09\n      \u663e\u793a\uff1a\u9ad8\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff08720p\uff09\u663e\u793a\u5927\u4e8e9\u82f1\u5bf8\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\uff0c\u6bcf\u79cd\u989c\u8272\u901a\u90538\u4f4d\n Internet\u8fde\u63a5\u548cMicrosoft\u5e10\u6237\uff1aWindows 11 Home Edition\u9700\u8981Internet\u8fde\u63a5\u548cMicrosoft\u5e10\u6237\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5728Windows 11\u4e2d\u5207\u6362\u8bbe\u590711\u5728S\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709Windows 11\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u9700\u8981Internet\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u6267\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u67d0\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u67d0\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u8981Microsoft\u5e10\u6237\u3002\n 2015\u5e74\uff0c\u5f53Microsoft\u91ca\u653e\u4e86Windows 10\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u521d\u5728\u7a0d\u540e\u7565\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u521d\u5bf9Windows 8\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u5728Windows 10x\u4e0a\u7684\u73b0\u5728\u88ab\u9057\u5f03\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7248\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9a6c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\n Windows 11\u7684\u65b0UI\uff0c\u5546\u5e97\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5728X86\uff0cARM\uff0c\u53ef\u6298\u53e0\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684UI\u5206\u5c42\u4e0b\u5012\u584c\u6216\u5012\u584c\u3002\u5fae\u8f6f\u5df2\u7ecf\u8db3\u591f\u4e86\uff0c8\u548cVista\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684Microsoft OS\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u9a8c\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u5b83\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002 ", "note_en": "Now that  Microsoft has announced Windows 11, you may be wondering what you\u2019ll need to install it. Confirming information pulled from  last week\u2019s leak, all you\u2019ll need to run it is a 64-bit CPU (or SoC), 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, specs that are only slightly higher than  Windows 10\u2019s current requirements. This marks the end of Windows support for older 32-bit hardware platforms, even though it will continue to run 32-bit software.\n The fastest way to find out if your system can handle Windows 11 is to download Microsoft\u2019s PC Health App ( click here), which will automatically tell you if your specs and settings are ready for the new OS.\n  Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with 2 or more cores on a compatible 64-bit processor  or System on a Chip (SoC)\n      Display: High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9-inches diagonally, 8 bits per color channel\n Internet connection and Microsoft accounts: Windows 11 Home edition requires internet connectivity and a Microsoft account  to complete device setup on first use. Switching a device out of Windows 11 Home in S mode also requires internet connectivity. For all Windows 11 editions, internet access is required to perform updates and to download and take advantage of some features. A Microsoft account is required for some features.\n In 2015,  when Microsoft released Windows 10, it initially kept the same hardware requirements from  Windows 8 before slightly increasing required storage size later. More recently, Microsoft\u2019s  now-abandoned work on Windows 10X showed an operating system that required even less horsepower than the standard edition, while working across a diverse spread of technology and device types.\n Windows 11\u2019s new UI, store, and other features will need to work on x86, Arm, foldable, flexible, and whatever is around the corner without breaking down or collapsing under their own weight or complicated UI layering. Microsoft had enough of that with 8 and Vista. This is a heads-up on what hardware the latest Microsoft OS targets, but we\u2019ll need experience to tell us how well it actually runs.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 06:00:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,microsoft,changing,\u9700\u8981", "title": "Microsoft\u6b63\u5728\u66f4\u6539Windows 11\u6700\u4f4e\u8981\u6c42 ", "title_en": "Microsoft Is Changing the Windows 11 Minimum Requirements", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/22544171/microsoft-windows-11-system-requirements-hardware", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "microsoft", "changing", "\u9700\u8981"]}]
