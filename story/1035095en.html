Cheryl described a fundamental denial of dignity when it came to the logistics of packing up her office after she was informed that she no longer had a job. She was briskly told to “hand in your keys, hand in your pager, hand in your ID card.” And while she packed up her office and separated out her personal belongings, “HR had somebody sitting next to me.”</p><p>几年前，就在谢丽尔被辞去医疗保健管理员的工作之后，我采访了她。谢丽尔描述说，当她被告知不再有工作后，收拾办公室的后勤工作从根本上剥夺了她的尊严。她很快被告知“交出你的钥匙，交出你的寻呼机，交出你的身份证。”当她收拾好自己的办公室，把自己的私人物品分开时，“人力资源部有个人坐在我旁边。”</p><p> The experience stung her. She viewed being policed in this way as being deemed untrustworthy. In her characteristic composed manner Cheryl told me: “I felt like I was not appreciated, quite frankly.” After several years of loyally working for the organisation, she had expected more.</p><p>这段经历刺痛了她。她认为被以这种方式监管被认为是不值得信任的。谢丽尔以她特有的镇定方式告诉我：“坦白地说，我觉得自己没有得到赏识。”在为该组织忠心耿耿地工作了几年之后，她对此寄予了更高的期望。</p><p> The unemployed men and women that I interviewed for my book,  Crunch Time: How Married Couples Confront Unemployment, were college-educated and belonged to dual-earner families. All lived and worked in the US and were parents. But across the world, and in  the UK, COVID has amplified job losses and fears over what will come next. These workers, too, will face some of the issues that participants in my book did.</p><p>我为我的书《嘎吱作响的时间：已婚夫妇如何面对失业》采访过的失业男女都受过大学教育，属于双职工家庭。他们都在美国生活和工作，都是父母。但在世界各地，包括在英国，COVID放大了失业和对接下来会发生什么的担忧。这些员工也将面临我书中参与者所面临的一些问题。</p><p> Through the course of my research I found that this bureaucratic denial of humanity, where workers were informed that they no longer had jobs and then escorted out supervised, was just the start of an arduous process that would test the emotional stamina of unemployed job-seekers. This only became more acute as they delved into job-searching.</p><p>在我的研究过程中，我发现，这种官僚对人性的否定--工人被告知他们不再有工作，然后在监督下被护送离开--只是一个艰难过程的开始，这将考验失业求职者的情绪耐力。随着他们深入找工作，这一问题只会变得更加尖锐。</p><p> Brian, who lost his corporate job about four months before I interviewed him, shook his head in exasperation with looking for jobs. “A lot of them, you don’t hear anything back,” he said. Christina, who lost her job working in the management side of the food industry described the emotional toll of trying to get re-employed while at a low professional point: “It’s really hard to go to a networking event … and shake a bunch of hands and smile when you think you’re not worth being scraped off of somebody’s shoe.”</p><p>布莱恩在我面试他的四个月前丢掉了公司的工作，他因找工作而恼火地摇了摇头。他说：“他们中的很多人，你都听不到任何回音。”失去了工作的克里斯蒂娜在食品行业的管理层工作，她描述了在职业低谷试图重新就业的情绪损失：“参加社交活动…真的很难。当你认为自己不值得被别人从鞋子上刮下来的时候，握手微笑。“。</p><p>  Christina’s reference to networking captures the widespread understanding among white-collar job-seekers in the US: that job searching is a  multi-layered activity which involves extensive networking, investing in upgrading skills certifications (for example, spending time and money on getting a certification for project management), learning how to craft resumes,  developing a brand, and generally devoting oneself to finding a job.</p><p>克里斯蒂娜提到的人脉关系抓住了美国白领求职者的普遍理解：求职是一项多层次的活动，包括广泛的人脉关系，投资于提升技能认证(例如，花费时间和金钱获得项目管理认证)，学习如何制作简历，发展品牌，以及总体上致力于找工作。</p><p> Applying to hundreds of jobs, going on dozens of interviews, and still not getting a job is devastating. Brian’s wife, Emily, was deeply worried about him, and wondered out loud to me: “How’re you going to find a job when you have no confidence and are very emotional?”</p><p>申请了数百份工作，参加了几十次面试，但仍然找不到工作，这是毁灭性的。布赖恩的妻子艾米丽非常担心他，她大声对我说：“你没有信心，又很情绪化，你怎么找工作呢？”</p><p>  The unemployed people I studied had frequently had successful professional careers. If measuring success by income, many had earned six-figure salaries and even received commendations and promotions right before they lost their jobs. (For example Kevin, an unemployed project manager I interviewed, had receiving an award from the president of his global company just a few months before he lost his job).</p><p>我研究的失业者经常拥有成功的职业生涯。如果以收入来衡量成功，许多人在失业前赚了六位数的薪水，甚至还获得了表彰和晋升。(例如，我采访的失业项目经理凯文(Kevin)在失业前几个月刚刚从他的全球公司总裁那里获得了一项奖励)。</p><p> Losing a job shook their self-confidence and made them doubt their professional worth. This was not helped by the process of job-searching. The advice that unemployed job-seekers in the US routinely receive, for instance through  job-search clubs, says that their personalities – the cheer, friendliness, enthusiasm,  passion – that they can convey to employers are as important, if not more, than their professional expertise.</p><p>失业动摇了他们的自信，让他们怀疑自己的职业价值。在求职过程中，这一点也无济于事。美国失业求职者经常收到的建议(例如通过求职俱乐部)表示，他们能向雇主传达的性格--欢快、友好、热情和激情--与他们的专业知识同等重要(如果不是更重要的话)。</p><p> As unemployed job-seekers navigate the complicated world of white-collar job-searching, they are told that if they are not finding a job it is because there is  a flaw within them: they don’t know how to search for jobs in the new economy; they need to upgrade their skills; they have not yet found their professional calling; they are not spending sufficient time searching for jobs.</p><p>当失业的求职者在复杂的白领求职世界中穿梭时，他们被告知，如果他们找不到工作，那是因为他们身上有一个缺陷：他们不知道如何在新经济中寻找工作；他们需要提升自己的技能；他们还没有找到自己的职业；他们没有花足够的时间寻找工作。</p><p>  But these understandings of unemployment as due to some sort of deficit within job-seekers ignore the larger, structural reality within which unemployment and job-searching take place. This is an economic reality where  good jobs are few and getting scarcer, where the  employer-worker contract is frayed, and where  risks have been offloaded onto individuals and their families. Even relatively credentialed and affluent workers, such as those I spoke to in my research, are not immune to these broader trends.</p><p>但是，这些关于失业是由于求职者内部的某种缺陷造成的理解忽视了失业和求职发生的更大的结构性现实。这是一个经济现实，好的工作机会很少，而且越来越少，雇主和工人的合同破裂，风险被转嫁到个人和他们的家庭身上。即使是相对有资历和富裕的员工，比如我在研究中采访的那些人，也不能幸免于这些更广泛的趋势。</p><p> Unemployed job-seekers are being gaslighted. Professional careers, even for the relatively more privileged white-collar workers, simply do not offer a path of economic security as they did in the post-war years. We live and work in an economic context where  precarity is widespread. Paid work as it currently exists is untenable for workers to depend on for the essentials of their lives, including planning for retirement or healthcare.</p><p>失业的求职者正处于火上浇油的状态。职业生涯，即使对于相对享有特权的白领来说，也不能像战后那样提供一条经济安全的道路。我们生活和工作在一种普遍存在早熟现象的经济环境中。对于工人来说，目前存在的有偿工作是无法维持他们生活必需品的，包括退休或医疗保健计划。</p><p> The focus on how individuals search for jobs – nit-picking on how they present their resumes, fussing over what demeanour they have in job interviews, questioning whether they have found their calling – fundamentally misdiagnoses the problem: that there are simply too few jobs of quality.</p><p>对个人求职方式的关注--挑剔他们展示简历的方式，对他们在求职面试中的举止大惊小怪，质疑他们是否找到了自己的使命--从根本上误诊了问题：有质量的工作实在太少了。</p><p> Solutions seeking to alleviate the challenges that unemployed job-seekers encounter need to shift away from providing individualised tools such as guiding job-seekers to take personality and aptitude tests to best determine where they belong vocationally. Rather, the focus should be on pushing for systemic change which recognises how very broken the organisation of paid work is currently. We can consider holding employers more accountable, as through labour and employment legislation. Another option is  universal basic income, which would provide a level of income to every citizen for the duration of their life. This would be an ample enough sum of money which would not require them to participate in paid work in order to meet the basics of living. Pushing for these types of changes would allow people to live lives of dignity even in the absence of paid work.</p><p>寻求缓解失业求职者遇到的挑战的解决方案，需要改变提供个性化工具，比如引导求职者参加个性和能力测试，以最好地确定他们在职业上属于哪里。相反，重点应该放在推动系统性改革上，认识到目前的有偿工作组织是多么地支离破碎。我们可以考虑通过劳工和就业立法，让雇主承担更多责任。另一种选择是全民基本收入，这将为每个公民的一生提供一定水平的收入。这将是一笔足够的钱，不需要他们为了满足基本生活而参加有偿工作。推动这些类型的变革将使人们即使在没有带薪工作的情况下也能过上有尊严的生活。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/jobseekers-are-being-gaslighted-all-too-often-being-told-unemployment-is-their-fault-149787">https://theconversation.com/jobseekers-are-being-gaslighted-all-too-often-being-told-unemployment-is-their-fault-149787</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/如释重负/">#如释重负</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
