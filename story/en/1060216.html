Its detailed illustrations, rich with color and varied linework, slowly fade from full color to muted, almost unfinished scenes. These are there for a purpose; the player is to bring color and life back to the island. But it’s also a technique designed to convey a sense of warmth and humanity — that this is a world touched by life.</p><p>舒适的树林世界看起来像画面的内部。其详细的插图，丰富的颜色和各种线路，慢慢地从全彩色淡化，静音，几乎未完成的场景。这些是有目的的;玩家是将色彩和生命带回岛屿。但它也是一种旨在传达温暖和人类感的技术 - 这是一个触及的世界。</p><p> Developer Spry Fox describes the game as “hand-drawn,” and that feel has always been a priority for the team. It’s a descriptor that plenty of games have taken on over the years; notable hand-drawn games include the likes of   Cuphead and   Spiritfarer, neither of which quite resemble  Cozy Grove’s hand-drawn style. After all, in breaking down the term “hand-drawn” to its simplest terms, we get something that’s drawn by hand — as obvious as that sounds. Most games have an element of drawing, with artists that create textures, illustrate backgrounds, and model characters. A lot of games would qualify as hand-drawn, but only some choose to adhere to that label. What does it mean for a game to be hand-drawn? As it turns out, that’s different for most developers.</p><p> Developer Spry Fox将游戏描述为“手绘”，并且觉得这一直是团队的优先事项。这是一年的描述符，多年来很多游戏;值得注意的手绘游戏包括Cuphead和Spiritfarer的喜欢，这两个都不是舒适的树林的手绘风格。毕竟，在将术语“手绘”术语中分解为最简单的条款，我们得到了手工绘制的东西 - 尽可能明显。大多数游戏都有一个绘图的元素，艺术家创建纹理，说明背景和模型字符。很多游戏都会有资格绘制，但只有一些选择遵守该标签。游戏手绘是什么意思？事实证明，大多数开发人员都是不同的。</p><p>  “One of our main goals was to make a game that looks like a beautiful sketchbook that gets colored by watercolor washes as the world and its characters evolve,”  Cozy Grove lead artist Noemí Gómez told Polygon. “The whole concept affected how we approach the line work — we aimed for a crispy, ink-looking linework — and rendering — heavily textured rendering — in  Cozy Grove to resemble traditional art.”</p><p>  “我们的主要目标之一是制作一款看起来像一个美丽的速写书，这是一个美丽的速写书，被水彩洗涤作为世界和它的角色发展，”舒适的Grove Lead ArtistNoemíGómez告诉多边形。 “整个概念影响了我们如何接近线路工作 - 我们的目标是令人脆弱的，墨水的界面 - 和渲染 - 在舒适的树林中造成纹理的渲染 - 以类似于传统艺术。”</p><p> Cozy Grove is drawn using digital tools, like a stylus on a touchscreen tablet, but in a way that makes it  look like it was created by a person using physical mediums: ink and watercolor. Its 2D objects and characters are specifically designed in a way to mimic the impact that a physically drawn line has. “As it turns out, there’s an aesthetic to lines,” Spry Fox co-founder and chief creative officer Daniel Cook said. “There’s something just very warm and personal about a hand-drawn line that varies ever so slightly in width, and where it ends and how it tails. We’ve had a lot of discussions about this: What makes a good line?”</p><p> 使用数字工具绘制舒适的树林，如触摸屏平板电脑上的手写笔，但在一种方法看起来像使用物理媒介的人创建的方式：墨水和水彩。其2D对象和字符专门设计以模仿物理绘制的线路的影响。 “事实证明，有一种审美线，”Spry Fox联合创始人和首席创意官员Daniel Cook表示。 “有一些非常温暖和个人关于手绘线条的东西，这宽度略有变化，而且它结束以及它的尾巴。我们对此有很多讨论：是什么让好线？“</p><p> Hand-drawn means a lot of different things to different people, and while I was doing research for this story, plenty of developers asked me:  Does my game count as hand-drawn? For me, the answer was yes, if they thought it counted — it’s not up to me to decide. Here’s what everyone said.</p><p> 手绘意味着对不同的人来说很多不同的东西，而我正在为这个故事做研究，很多开发人员问我：我的游戏是否按照手绘？对我来说，答案是肯定的，如果他们认为它计算 - 这不是由我决定的。这是每个人所说的。</p><p>    Mundaun is unique in the way it’s hand-drawn. From solo developer Michel Ziegler and published by MWM Interactive,  Mundaun’s art is modeled on a computer, with hand-drawn pencil textures drawn and scanned to the computer art. The resulting look is stunning — unlike any other game I’ve seen before.</p><p>    Mundaun在它手绘的方式中是独一无二的。来自Solo Developer Michel Ziegler并由MWM Interactive发布，Mundaun的艺术在电脑上建模，手绘铅笔纹理绘制并扫描到计算机艺术。由此产生的外观令人惊叹 - 与我以前见过的任何其他游戏不同。</p><p>  The first step is to create the 3D model digitally and doing the UV Unwrap, [which is a process that makes models flat]. I then physically print out the UV maps and trace them roughly on a lightbox onto a fresh piece of paper. Then I usually do a rough sketch pass on them, especially if it is for something like a face texture, where the drawing needs to somewhat align with the 3D model. Things like wood or rocks are obviously more forgiving in that regard. I scan the drawing and apply it to the 3D model, which is my favorite moment. I repeat drawing and scanning until I am happy with the result.</p><p>  第一步是数字地创建3D模型并进行UV unwrap，[这是一个使模型平面的过程]。然后，我在紫外线地图上留出了紫外线，并大致追踪在灯箱上的一张新鲜的纸上。然后我通常会在它们上做一个粗略的草图传递，特别是如果它是面部纹理的东西，其中绘图需要与3D模型一致。像木头或岩石这样的东西显然更宽容这方面。我扫描绘图并将其应用于3D模型，这是我最喜欢的时刻。我重复绘制和扫描，直到我对结果感到满意。 </p><p> But I think I designed the game in the same way that a drawing builds from sketch to the finished thing. Being a solo dev allowed me to work on the game world and systems in an organic way, adding details, scenes, and elements as it felt natural. Everything was growing at the same time. The world, the characters, the plot, the gameplay. I hope the players can feel the same element of discovery throughout the game that I felt while creating it.</p><p>但我认为我以与绘图从素描到成品的方式相同的方式设计了游戏。作为一个独唱的Dev让我以有机方式在游戏世界和系统上工作，添加细节，场景和元素，因为它感到自然。一切都在同时增长。世界，人物，情节，游戏玩法。我希望球员在整个游戏中感受到同样的发现要素，我在创造它时感受到了。</p><p> Drawing is my main passion. I discovered it rather late in life, but it did change the way I look at things in a major way. So whenever possible, I want to use that form of expression. I like unwieldy processes with an element of randomness. Whenever I first apply a drawn texture to a model, there is an element of surprise. It’s just too much fun to discover things that work by accident.</p><p> 绘画是我的主要激情。我发现了它的生活中很晚，但它确实改变了我以主要方式看待事物的方式。因此，只要有可能，我想使用这种表达形式。我喜欢随机性元素的笨重进程。每当我第一次将绘制的纹理应用于模型时，都有一个惊喜的元素。发现偶然工作的东西太有趣了。</p><p>    Before Your Eyes is played with the player’s own eyes — their real-life blinks, tracked by a webcam, control the story.  Before Your Eyes skips forward each time the player blinks. The visuals are important; this is a game played with eyes, after all. Artist Hana Lee told me that having  Before Your Eyes have a hand-drawn feel was essential: “[ Before Your Eyes] waves between a dream-like setting and the real world, and I don’t think this could have been conveyed in an interesting way if the game had hyperrealistic graphics.”</p><p>    在你的眼睛与球员自己的眼睛玩耍之前 - 他们的真实生活眨眼，被网络摄像头追踪，控制故事。每次播放器眨眼时，在眼睛前进之前。视觉效果很重要;这是一场与眼睛一起玩的游戏。艺术家Hana Lee告诉我，在你的眼前有一种手绘感觉是必不可少的：“在你的眼前]在梦想的环境和现实世界之间挥手，我认为这可能已经在一个人中传达如果游戏具有高估的图形，有趣的方式。“</p><p>  The cozy atmosphere with the vibrant background colours would definitely not have been the same if it weren’t hand-drawn.</p><p>  如果舒适的背景颜色与绘制的舒适的氛围肯定没有相同的氛围。</p><p> I’ve always worked in a hand-drawn style so I can’t really say how much it’s different from a game that’s not hand-drawn, but I think the process is quite simple. Low poly models work very well with the cartoonish side of my style, so it’s really about trying to get the general shapes right and how many polygons I can cut down on to make things as simple as possible, but also have them be expressive. Having character models be mocapped was a first for me, so that brought very interesting results where cartoonish characters were really coming to life.</p><p> 我一直都在手绘风格中工作，所以我不能真正说出与不是手绘的游戏不同的东西，但我认为这个过程很简单。低聚模型与我的态度的卡通方面非常好，所以真的是试图让一般形状正确，我可以减少多少多边形，以使事情尽可能简单，但也让他们成为表现力。拥有角色模型是Mocapped的第一个对我来说是第一个，因此带来了非常有趣的结果，卡通角色真的来到生机。</p><p> In addition to this, the protagonist Benjamin isn’t exactly verbal, so to have him express himself we added in hand-drawn and animated UI when he makes decisions. There are also scenes where he creates art, so likewise we animated these to show that he’s putting care into his creative decisions. Some illustrations have short “start to finish” animations too, to show that he’s drawing.</p><p> 除此之外，主角Benjamin并不是口头，所以当他做出决定时，让他表达自己在手绘和动画UI中添加。还有他创造艺术的场景，所以我们同样地让这些人能够表明他正在照顾他的创造性决策。一些插图也有短暂的“开始完成”动画，以表明他是绘画。</p><p> As for 2D assets in the game, I did everything digitally but I stuck to using brushes that have rough edges to make them quite literally look hand-drawn. I used a rough marker brush for most of them so that they still fit with the general style of the game, and for some animations I used one that leaned more towards oil paint and gouache.</p><p> 至于游戏中的2D资产，我以数字方式做的一切，但我暂时使用有粗糙边缘的刷子来使它们完全看起来手绘。我对大多数人使用了一把粗糙的标记刷，以便他们仍然适合游戏的一般风格，并且对于一些动画，我使用了一个靠在油漆和水粉中的一个动画。 </p><p> I feel like hyperrealism often breaks expression and vibrancy, and if the game leaned more towards this side I think the story would have had a much heavier tone, rather than a whimsical and more hopeful one. I think many characters, like the Ferryman for example, would not have worked if he were a realistic, anthropomorphic coyote.</p><p>我觉得非常夸张的主义往往会破坏表达和活力，如果游戏倾向于这一侧，我认为这个故事会有一个更重的语气，而不是异想天开的和更有希望的故事。例如，如果他是一个现实的人类核心科托特，我认为很多人物都不会有效。</p><p> Considering this is a game you play with your eyes as well, we’d like players to try and focus on every detail we put into every scene. There’s something fun and interesting in every nook and cranny of the game that gives the characters depth and personality, and by having these be simplified in a hand-drawn style, they’re much easier to take in.</p><p> 考虑到这是一个你和你的眼睛一起玩的游戏，我们希望玩家试图尝试，专注于我们投入每个场景的每个细节。在游戏的每个角落和克兰西都有一些有趣和有趣的东西，它给出了人物深度和个性，并且通过在手绘风格中简化了这些，它们更容易进入。</p><p>   If Found... was one of my favorite games of last year, and I loved the mechanic of erasing. The game, created by developer Dreamfeel and published by Annapurna Interactive, is about a queer woman in Ireland in the ’90s. It’s basically a journal based around a specific time period in Kaiso’s life.</p><p>   如果发现......是我去年最喜欢的游戏之一，我喜欢擦除的技工。由Developer Dreamfeel创建并由Annapurna Interactive出版的游戏，是在90年代在爱尔兰的一个奇怪的女人。它基本上是一系列基于Kaiso生活中的特定时间段的期刊。</p><p> It was heartbreaking to erase the lovely drawings from artist Liadh Young — but that pain was essential to the story. Young started a diary of her own for inspiration, doodling and scribbling to fill out pages that were scanned to create the game’s final art.</p><p> 擦除艺术家Liadyh Young的可爱图纸是令人心碎的 - 但这种痛苦对故事至关重要。年轻人开始了她自己的日记，以获得灵感，涂鸦和涂鸦填写扫描的页面，以创造游戏的最终艺术。</p><p>   The story is mostly told through Kasio’s diary. Through drawings and text she records her surroundings and her own emotions during this period of time. To give the diary an authentic feel the art of Kasio’s diary was drawn in pencil on paper and scanned in. I drew hundreds of pages for every little piece of art in the game.</p><p>   故事主要通过Kasio的日记告诉。通过图纸和文本，她在这段时间内记录了她周围的环境和她自己的情绪。为了给日记，真正的感觉纸上的纸上绘制了Kasio日记的艺术，并扫描了。我在比赛中为每一条艺术作品提供了数百页。</p><p> We wanted the diary to feel as realistic as possible. During development I also started my own diary similar to Kasio’s and it helped me get into the mindset of what Kasio would record in her daily life and how she would draw certain subjects. I found when keeping a diary, you would draw yourself as a scribbly mess, draw your friends with the utmost care, and doodle mindlessly around text when you were thinking about other things.</p><p> 我们希望日记尽可能逼真。在开发期间，我也开始了我自己的日记，类似于Kasio的日记，它帮助我进入了Kasio会在她的日常生活中记录的思维方式以及她将如何吸引某些主题。我发现当留着日记时，你会像潦草的混乱那样将自己吸引，尽可能地在思考其他事情时乱画。</p><p> While reading the script I would sketch moments as if I was filling out a diary page, kind of following Kasio’s stream of consciousness. These sketches would sometimes then be fleshed out into more refined illustrations, but we scanned and kept every single drawing in the process! Later these extra sketches and doodles would occasionally also become part of the collages and get used in unexpected places.</p><p> 在阅读脚本时，我会勾勒出时刻，好像我填写了日记页，那种追随kasio的意识流。这些草图有时会被充实更精致的插图，但我们在过程中扫描并保留每张图画！后来这些额外的草图和涂鸦偶尔也会成为拼贴的一部分，并在意想不到的地方使用。 </p><p> I was given a lot of free rein in the style of the art and composition of the images. I think that freedom to draw in my own style made the art of  If Found feel very personal. I think it emphasized that the story was illustrated by the protagonist, Kasio.</p><p>我在艺术风格和图像的组成方面获得了很多自由度。我认为自由地绘制自己的风格，使得如果发现感觉非常私种。我认为它强调，故事是由主角，Kasio说明的。</p><p> When director Llaura McGee and I were brainstorming for  If Found, the idea of a diary came quite naturally due to our shared interest in zine culture, indie comics and my preference for drawing on paper and in sketchbooks. We set out to make a game that combined a sketchbook, the unique erasing mechanic and a narrative. The game was built around the art direction, rather than the other way around.</p><p> 当Direct Llaura McGee和我在头脑风暴的情况下，如果发现，日记的想法是自然的，因为我们对Zine文化，独立漫画和我在纸上绘制和书法书中绘制的兴趣和我的偏好而自然而然。我们旨在制作一个比赛，组合素描簿，独特的擦除技工和叙述。游戏是在艺术方向上建造的，而不是另外的方式。</p><p> I think one interesting way the art influences how  If Found is played in the erasing mechanic. You have to erase the drawings to progress the story, and apparently some people struggle with erasing Kasio’s memories, especially the happier ones!</p><p> 我认为艺术的一个有趣方式影响了在擦除机械师中的发挥作用。你必须抹去图画来进步故事，并且显然有些人争取抹去Kasio的回忆，特别是更快乐的回忆！</p><p>   DrinkBox Studios will release  Nobody Saves the World “soon-ish,” and I’m eager to see more of its colorful cartoon art style. From the developer of  Guacamelee!,  Nobody Saves the World is an action role-playing game with art that looks as interesting as the gameplay. And, according to DrinkBox Studios concept lead August Quijano, it’s hand-drawn:</p><p>   Drinkbox Studios将释放没有人拯救世界“很快 -  ish”，我渴望看到更多的多彩卡通艺术风格。从Guacamelee的开发人员！，没有人拯救世界是一个动作角色扮演游戏，艺术看起来像游戏玩法一样有趣。并且，根据Drinkbox Studios概念的概念威尔Quijano，它是手绘：</p><p> I think people use “hand-drawn” to mean that the art was created with traditional animation techniques, e.g., using pencil and paper, flipping through drawings with a lightbox, and maybe as far as inking and coloring each frame by hand. But, technology has allowed us to make stylistic choices and have options, so most of the games have some “hand-drawn” component and it makes the definition murky.</p><p> 我认为人们使用“手绘”表示，使用传统的动画技术，例如，使用铅笔和纸张，通过用灯箱翻转图纸，并且可以通过手动涂上墨水和着色。但是，技术使我们能够做出风格选择并具有选择，因此大多数游戏都有一些“手绘”组件，它使定义模糊不清。</p><p> We now use monitors you can draw on with a special pen into an animation software. It’s all drawn digitally by hand, but might not be considered “hand-drawn” by some because it’s a paperless process.</p><p> 我们现在使用Monitors您可以用特殊笔绘制到动画软件中。它全都用手绘制，但可能不被认为是“手绘”，因为这是无纸化过程。</p><p> Having just finished creating a few games with characters that used a very polygonal style (e.g.,  Guacamelee ! 2), we found ourselves wanting to do something different, so we began exploring different styles. We were exploring linework that could convey some sense of “grossness” like  Ren and Stimpy, or  Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, but integrated into a world similar in feel to the early Zelda games.</p><p> 刚刚完成了一些与使用非常多边形风格的角色的游戏（例如，Guacamelee！2），我们发现自己想要做一些不同的事情，所以我们开始探索不同的风格。我们正在探索界面，可以传达某些人的“粗暴”感，或者是一个刺激的“刺激”，或者aaahh !!!真正的怪物，但融入了一个与早期塞尔达游戏相似的世界。 </p><p>   Artist Noemí Gómez described  Cozy Grove as “adult cozy,” a game that’s cute and warm but, ultimately, has serious themes. The art style, which has a little more punch than a game like   Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is a key factor in how it’s perceived.</p><p>艺术家NoemíGómez将舒适的树林描述为“成人舒适”，这是一个可爱和温暖的游戏，但最终有严肃的主题。这款艺术风格比动物交叉等游戏更大的艺术风格：新的视野，是如何感知的关键因素。</p><p> We like to define Cozy Grove’s style as “Adult cozy”, to achieve this style we took a lot of inspiration from Ghibli movies, especially when it comes to the whole vibe and atmosphere. Another big inspiration was  Over the Garden Wall, which I think captures and balances the cozy and spooky vibes really well. Style-wise you can clearly see references to  Don’t Starve’s art style.</p><p> 我们喜欢将舒适的树林的风格定义为“成人舒适”，实现这种风格，我们从Ghibli电影中汲取了很多灵感，特别是在整个氛围和氛围中。另一个大型灵感是在花园墙上，我认为真的很好地捕捉和平衡舒适和幽灵般的振动。风格明智，您可以清楚地看到引用不要饿死的艺术风格。</p><p> Making a game that resembles traditional art makes it difficult to create a fast and efficient work process as every asset was made with attention to detail (to also enhance the hidden object factor in Cozy Grove). Every artist working in the project had to put their artistic potential into the rendering of every individual asset to create this effect, while similar titles in the market go for a cell-shading art style for this kind of game. All in all, we had to work extra hard to deliver big loads of highly detailed pieces of art into Cozy Grove!</p><p> 制作类似传统艺术的游戏使得难以创造一个快速高效的工作过程，因为每个资产都是注意细节（也增强了舒适的树林中的隐藏物体因素）。在该项目中工作的每个艺术家都必须将他们的艺术潜力纳入每个个人资产的渲染，以创造这种效果，而市场上的类似标题是这种游戏的蜂窝阴影艺术风格。总而言之，我们不得不努力为舒适的树林提供大量高度详细的艺术品！</p><p> The art style was set pretty early on as well as the basic game mechanics but I think we got super attached to the characters very early which I think was one of the decisive factors that turned Cozy Grove into the heavily story focused game it is today.</p><p> 艺术风格很早就和基本的游戏机制相得很好，但我认为我们非常早些时候我认为这是我认为这是将舒适的树林变成了沉重的故事的决定性因素之一。</p><p>    Little Nemo and the Nightmare Fiends is coming to Nintendo Switch and Windows PC, and it’s based on the cartoonist Winsor McCay’s comic strips. That’s evident from the art style and animation: It feels like it’s been pulled straight from the era. Game designer Chris Totten spoke about the game:</p><p>    Little Nemo和Nightmare Fiends即将到任天堂交换机和Windows PC，它基于漫画家Winsor McCay的漫画条。这是从艺术风格和动画中明显的：感觉就像它被直接从时代拉动。 Game Designer Chris Totten谈到了这个游戏：</p><p> For us “hand-drawn” is a way to experiment with bringing game art closer to other art forms (especially traditional animation, which [Winsor] McCay was an early pioneer of) and getting to explore animation history. We’re paying homage to the artwork of an important figure that set the stage for many of the processes we use today, so we wanted to get as close to his style as possible.</p><p> 对于我们“手绘”是一种尝试将游戏艺术更接近其他艺术形式的方法（特别是传统动画，其中[WinSor]麦迪是一个早期先锋）并进入动画历史。我们向艺术品支付了一个重要人物的艺术品，为我们今天使用的许多流程设定了舞台，因此我们希望尽可能接近他的风格。</p><p> COVID-19 knocked out our ability to do a full in-studio ink-on-cels process of the kind you saw with  Cuphead (or traditional feature animation in general), so we’re using the new 2D animation tools in the free and open-source digital animation program Blender. Rather than using vectors or anything like that, we’re still drawing the animations by hand with tablets following traditional animation principles like  Disney’s 12 Principles of Animation, in-betweening (which McCay invented), and so on. To keep this process as “old school” as possible , we’re staying away from more modern elements of our animation software like armatures (“bones” put inside artwork to make it move), “puppet” animation (think Flash cartoons), or interpolation (draw shape A, then draw shape B on a later frame, and the computer makes everything between.) We’re doing everything we can with straightforward drawing.</p><p> Covid-19淘汰了我们在Cuphead（或一般传统的特征动画）中看到的那种完整的工作室内墨水的进程的能力，所以我们在自由中使用新的2D动画工具开源数字动画程序搅拌机。而不是使用那样的向量或任何东西，我们仍然用手动用平板电脑绘制动画，这些动画原则如迪斯尼的12个动画原则，在内的（发明了麦克那），等等。为了使这个过程尽可能地成为“旧学校”，我们远离更多的动画软件的现代元素，如动手（“骨头”放入艺术品，使其移动），“傀儡”动画（想想闪存漫画），或插值（绘制形状a，然后在后面的框架上绘制形状b，并且计算机使其之间的一切。）我们正在通过直接的绘图做一切。 </p><p> Nightmare Fiends is as much a celebration of an important artist’s work as much as it is a cool indie game. Winsor McCay laid the groundwork for the comics and animation industries as we know them, which in turn had a lot of influences on games.</p><p>噩梦恶魔是一个重要的艺术家的庆祝活动，因为它是一个很酷的独立游戏。 Winsor McCay在我们了解它们时为漫画和动画行业奠定了基础，这反过来又对游戏产生了很多影响。</p><p>   Triple Topping’s  Welcome to Elk is a game that tells true stories told to the developer from memory. The stories were combined to create the narrative, and the art style reflects the magic and organicness of the story. It’s digitally drawn, using a specific aesthetic to give it that touch, though Triple Topping Games’ Murray Somerville said some textures were made with charcoal and white oil paint and then scanned into a library that artists pulled from.</p><p>   Triple Topping欢迎来到麋鹿是一款讲述了从内存告诉开发人员的真实故事的游戏。该故事组合以创造叙述，艺术风格反映了故事的魔法和有机物。它在数字绘制的是，使用特定的美学来使其触摸，虽然三倍的顶部游戏'Murray Somerville表示，一些纹理是用木炭和白色油漆制成的，然后扫描到艺术家拉动的库中。</p><p> “I think there’s something about seeing a physical mark that subconsciously communicates to a viewer the understanding that this was ‘handmade,’” said Somerville.</p><p> “我认为看到一个潜意识地向观众沟通的物理标记有些东西，这是一个”手工制作“的理解”，“索维尔说。</p><p> I think what makes me think of a game as “hand drawn” is something to do with seeing some evidence of physicality in the art making. I think there are quirks and personalized ways of mark making that make you visualize someone actually making that line rather than from a computer.</p><p> 我认为是什么让我想到一个游戏，因为“手绘”是与看艺术制作中的一些物质的证据有关。我认为有怪癖和个性化的标记方式，让您可视化实际制作那条线而不是计算机的人。</p><p> With  Welcome to Elk, the game is based on true stories so we wanted the art to feel personal and capture that “hand drawn” feeling so it has a connection to the power of storytelling. Something which tells you a human made this, much in the same way we get from the way we tell stories to one another.</p><p> 欢迎来到麋鹿，这场比赛是基于真实的故事，所以我们希望艺术觉得个人和捕捉“手绘”的感觉，所以它与讲故事的力量有关。告诉你一个人为这一点的东西，我们从我们识别彼此的故事的方式相同。</p><p> The way we did this is, we drew everything “free hand” — which isn’t anything profound, it just means that when drawing, everything from characters to backgrounds, we did with our hands and without using digital tools that would simulate more “correct” structure. So straight lines are never completely straight because they have been drawn by hand, same with shapes like circles — nothing is a clean representation but instead something which has been done to the best it can be by a human hand and eye.</p><p> 我们这样做的方式，我们画了一切都是“免费手” - 这不是一个深刻的东西，这只是意味着当绘制时，从角色到背景，我们用手而且没有使用模拟更多的数字工具“正确的“结构。因此，直线永远不会完全直接，因为它们已经用手绘制，与圈子一样的形状 - 没有什么是清洁的表示，而是由人类的手和眼睛所做的事情。</p><p> I think it’s in the consistency of seeing these small imperfections, these small bumps and awkwardness that conveys a “hand drawn” aesthetic, because we can mostly all relate to the idea of trying to draw a straight line.</p><p> 我认为这是看到这些小缺陷的一致性，这些小颠簸和尴尬传达了“手绘”美学，因为我们大多数都与试图绘制直线的想法有关。 </p><p>   Code Romantic is a visual novel that teaches coding, and a lot hinges on the art. It’s a love story with unique, compelling characters from prettysmart games, with watercolor illustrations from Allyson Kelley. And it teaches you to code! Miko Charbonneau, founder of prettysmart games, and Kelley told me about the game and its art.</p><p>代码浪漫是一种教导编码的视觉小说，以及艺术的许多铰链。这是一个独特，令人信服的人物的爱情故事，来自漂亮的比赛，来自Allyson Kelley的水彩插图。它教你来代码！ Miko Charbonneau，PrettySmart Games的创始人和Kelley告诉我关于游戏及其艺术的信息。</p><p>  I would classify anything drawn by a hand either on paper or with a stylus as hand-drawn. However, we emphasize this aspect of our game because all of the characters and backgrounds were sketched, inked and painted by hand on paper. The watercolors are scanned in, colored, and made into character asset sheets. The face pieces are painted digitally by Allyson. Then I assemble them and animate them in Unity.</p><p>  我会在纸上或用手绘手写手写的手绘制的任何东西。但是，我们强调了我们游戏的这个方面，因为所有的人物和背景都被勾勒出，墨水和绘制的纸上。水彩画扫描，彩色，并制成字符资产板。面部碎片由allyson以数字方式绘制。然后我组装它们并以统一为它们动画。</p><p> To me it’s like making a movie, you have to do a lot of pre-planning for every shot because it’s costly to re-shoot it later. I think it was worth it, though. There’s a natural aspect to seeing little pencil marks and hints of paper that brings it a human quality.</p><p> 对我来说，这就像制作一部电影，你必须为每次射门做大量预先计划，因为它以后重新拍摄它的昂贵。但我认为这是值得的。看到一点铅笔标记和暗示纸张的自然方面是一种自然的方面，使其成为人类质量。</p><p> I was excited by the challenge of bringing traditional watercolors into a digital, interactive environment. I wanted Allyson to work in the way she was most comfortable and I wanted the end result to have a lot of personality. The art definitely changed the way the game looks and feels! We were influenced by propaganda posters and romanticism landscapes, and Allyson combined these inspirations with her own style. Even though the game takes place over a hundred years in the future, there’s a nostalgic charm to the setting and the character designs that surprised me. The machines in particular took on a whimsical quality I couldn’t have come up with on my own.</p><p> 将传统水彩画融入数字，交互环境的挑战，我很兴奋。我希望allyson在她最舒服的方式上工作，我希望最终结果有很多个性。艺术肯定改变了游戏的外观和感觉！我们受到宣传海报和浪漫主义景观的影响，allyson与她自己的风格相结合这些启示。即使这场比赛在未来百年超过一百年的情况下，也有一个怀旧的魅力，旨在让我感到惊讶的角色设计。特别是机器采用异想天开的品质，我无法自己想出。</p><p> Code Romantic is a visual novel with coding puzzles, so there’s not as much gameplay as other genres. The art definitely influenced how we chose to do animations and cinematics, however. We wanted to include as many different poses as possible, which led to the separate pieces approach with more animations and a more dynamic camera.</p><p> 代码浪漫是一种具有编码拼图的视觉小说，因此与其他类型没有游戏玩法。然而，本领域肯定会影响我们选择如何做动画和电影。我们希望尽可能多地包括不同的姿势，这导致了具有更多动画和更具动态摄像头的单独的碎片。</p><p>   I think the biggest difference between  Code Romantic and many other hand-drawn 2D games is how much we embraced the texture and messiness of a traditional medium. There’s a certain lack of control, or randomness, that you get from watercolor and ink that just don’t happen when you work digitally. With digital hand-drawn games and illustrations you either have to add in that messiness and variations or embrace the exacting smoothness.</p><p>   我认为代码浪漫和许多其他手绘2D游戏之间的最大区别是我们拥抱传统媒体的质地和混乱的程度。您可以从水彩画和墨水中获得一定缺乏控制或随机性，当您数量上工作时，即将不会发生。使用数字手绘游戏和插图，您要么必须添加那个混乱和变体或拥抱严格的平滑度。</p><p> But now there are so many great textured brushes that digital work can really look just like traditional work!</p><p> 但现在有很多伟大的纹理画笔，数字工作真的可以看起来像传统工作！ </p><p> We started with a script and created storyboards. Front there we made sure the story was working and planned out what poses or game assets we needed. Most character poses and early game assets started traditionally and as the game progressed and new pieces were needed, the sketches were then done digitally to help speed up production.</p><p>我们从脚本开始并创建了故事板。在那里，我们确保故事正在努力，并计划我们需要的姿势或游戏资产。传统上，大多数角色姿势和早期游戏资产开始，随着游戏的进展和新的碎片，然后以数字方式进行速度以帮助加速生产。</p><p> Then they are transferred to watercolor paper and inked in either brown or sepia. I start with a yellow ochre wash, and then apply some basic shading in a purple gray mix. Then they are scanned in, cleaned up, and colored in Photoshop. The ochre wash helps all the characters and elements feel more unified while using Photoshop allows us to have a more consistent and controlled color.</p><p> 然后将它们转移到水彩纸上并在棕色或棕褐色中涂上墨水。我从一个黄色的赭色洗，然后在紫色灰色混合中涂上一些基本的阴影。然后他们被扫描，清理，并在Photoshop中色。 Ocher Wash帮助所有字符和元素在使用Photoshop时允许我们具有更一致和控制的颜色。</p><p> Other games that rely on 3D assets would most likely start with the same initial concept and sketch stages then move on to modeling, sculpting, rigging, texturing, then animating. Recently though I’ve been seeing really fascinating 3D sculptures and assets that are blending watercolor pieces and textures into their games. It’s amazing!</p><p> 其他依赖3D资产的游戏很可能从相同的初始概念和草图阶段开始，然后继续建模，雕刻，索具，纹理，然后是动画。最近，我一直看到真正迷人的3D雕塑和资产，这些资产将水彩作品和纹理融入他们的游戏中。太奇妙了！</p><p>    Out of Line looks like a painting — a whimsical journey in a fantastical, mysterious world.
