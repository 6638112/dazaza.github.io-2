", "note_en": "A week after Ukrainian police  arrested criminals affiliated with the notorious Cl0p ransomware gang, Cl0p has published a fresh batch of what\u2019s purported to be confidential data stolen in a hack of a previously unknown victim. Ars won\u2019t be identifying the possibly victimized company until there is confirmation that the data and the hack are genuine.\n  If genuine, the dump shows that Cl0p remains intact and able to carry out its nefarious actions despite the arrests. That suggests that the suspects don\u2019t include the core leaders but rather affiliates or others who play a lesser role in the operations. The data purports to be employee records, including verification of employment for loan applications and documents pertaining to workers whose wages have been garnished. I was unable to confirm that the information is genuine and that it was, in fact, taken during a hack on the company, although web searches showed that names listed in the documents matched names of people who work for the company.\n Company representatives didn\u2019t respond to a phone call seeking comment. Cl0p members didn\u2019t respond to emails sent to addresses listed on the group\u2019s site on the dark web.\n   For almost a decade, ransomware has grown from a costly inconvenience into an existential threat that can  shut down hospitals and disrupt  gasoline and  meat supplies. Under pressure from the Biden administration, the US Justice Department is  prioritizing federal ransomware cases. Biden also raised concerns with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the proliferation of ransomware attacks from Russian-speaking groups, such as Cl0p. Last week\u2019s apprehension by Ukrainian police of six people affiliated with Cl0p was seen as a coup in some circles because it marked the first time a national law enforcement group has carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group. But as Wired reporter Lily Hay Newman  observed, the crackdown is unlikely to ease the ransomware epidemic until Russia itself follows suit.\n    The new leak confirms the limits of current ransomware response. Much of the flimsiness stems from the decentralization of the ransomware economy, which rests on two crucial but independent entities. The first is the group that maintains the ransomware itself and often some of the Internet infrastructure it runs on.\n The second entity is the team of hackers that leases the ransomware and shares any revenue generated with the ransomware maintainers. Often, one group has little or no knowledge of the other, so the shutdown of one has no effect on the other.\n  Compounding the difficulty law enforcement faces, many of the groups reside in Russia or other Eastern European countries that have no extradition treaties with the US.\n Cl0p was first spotted in early 2019. Recent targets have included oil company Shell, international law firm Jones Day, US bank Flagstar, and several US universities including Stanford and the University of California. Often, affiliated hacker exploit vulnerabilities in the Accellion File Transfer Appliance. Cl0p has also been observed operating broad malicious email campaigns to  identify potential corporate victims.

When customers view a shop on WhatsApp, they\u2019ll have the option of chatting with a business before buying something.\n   At its F8 conference earlier this month, Facebook revealed updates to WhatsApp for Business \u2014 previously, it could take weeks to set up a business account, but now, businesses can sign up in just a few minutes. Though WhatsApp has more than 2 billion global users, only about 175 million people message with WhatsApp Business accounts daily for things like customer support. Since Facebook has been  pushing e-commerce on platforms like Instagram, it makes sense that this initiative will expand to WhatsApp too.\n The rollout for Shops in WhatsApp will start soon, and Shops inventory in Marketplace is available now for Shops in the US with on-site checkout.\n The next feature, Shops Ads, aims to provide a more individualized shopping experience based on people\u2019s individual shopping habits. Zuckerberg said, \u201cWe\u2019re launching the ability for a business to send shoppers to where you\u2019re going to be most likely to make a purchase based on your shopping behavior.\u201d Starting now, AR Dynamic Ads are available in the United States \u2013 companies like Huda Beauty and Laura Mercier are using these ads to let customers test lipstick shades with AR before making a purchase. These AR try-on experiences are made available through API integrations with Modiface and  Perfect Corp. Early this year,  Pinterest collaborated with ModiFace to launch an AR eyeshadow try-on.\n  Over on Instagram, an AI-based Visual Search feature will roll out for testing in the coming months.\n \u201cA lot of shopping discovery begins with visual discovery, right, so you see something that you think is awesome. And then, you know, maybe you want to see other products that are like that, or you want to figure out how to get that product,\u201d Zuckerberg explained. \u201cAnd this is the type of problem that AI can really help out with.\u201d\n Using this AI, people will be able to upload their own photos \u2014 even ones they haven\u2019t posted on Instagram \u2014 to find similar items. Facebook isn\u2019t the first company to use this technology \u2014 see  Cadeera,  Donde Search, or  Stye.ai, for instance. But bringing this technology to major platforms might change the way we shop, which seems to be Facebook\u2019s current goal.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 04:35:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

And they don&#39;t necessarily mean the administration won&#39;t crack down on the practices of large tech companies. And the president  recently appointed renowned Silicon Valley critic Lina Khan to head the Federal Trade Commission.\n But they do suggest a closeness between the tech industry and the Biden administration during a time when the former is under massive scrutiny.\n  According to our review, Facebook leads the pack with 11 administration officials who previously worked for the company in some capacity. Alphabet came in second with 10 officials and Microsoft trailed with eight.\n   The officials are spread through the government, although the White House is home to the most people who worked for the companies at 13, representing around 8 percent of the White House staffers whose filings The Technology 202 examined. The State Department and Pentagon tied for second place with 6 officials each, the review shows.\n Some of the officials with the most ties to Big Tech serve at the top of the administration. Secretary of State  Antony Blinken, for example, disclosed providing \u201cadvisory services\u201d to Facebook, Uber, Microsoft and LinkedIn, which is now owned by Microsoft.\n Other members of Biden\u2019s Cabinet, such as Homeland Security Secretary  Alejandro Mayorkas, provided legal services for Uber and ex-Twitter executive  Gabriel Stricker, who is now chief communications officer at the Emerson Collective. Director of National Intelligence  Avril Haines advised Microsoft and\u00a0Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Denis McDonough provided strategic advice to Apple.\n The financial disclosure filings do not provide details about the work, including start and end dates. WestExec Advisors, the firm Blinken and Haines consulted through, &#34;advised on issues related to cyberspace and global efforts to better protect customers from cyberattacks,&#34; Microsoft spokeswoman Kate Frischmann said. Uber and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Facebook and Twitter declined to comment.\n  The all-encompassing nature of the tech industry presents challenges for the administration, consumer advocates warn.\n \u201cTech policy can encompass basically every part of the federal government,\u201d from tax policy, to transportation issues, said Max Moran, the research director of the personnel team of the Revolving Door Project, an initiative of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research that looks at government appointees.\n The officials also may have a hand in the selection of other officials who could play a major role in tech policy.\n Progressive groups want Deputy Attorney General  Lisa Monaco \u2014 the Justice Department\u2019s second-highest-ranking official \u2014 to recuse herself from deliberations about the future leader of the department\u2019s Antitrust Division because she provided \u201clegal services\u201d to Apple before entering the government.\n   \u201cIndividuals with personal ties to Big Tech should be prevented from playing a role in determining who will lead the Antitrust Division,\u201d 18 groups, including the Revolving Door Project, wrote in an April\u00a0 letter  to Biden.\n \u201cIn the interest of preserving the integrity and independence of the office, we urge that Monaco be removed from the deliberation process over who will lead the Antitrust Division,\u201d they added.\n In general, Biden administration officials are required to sign an\u00a0 ethics pledge  prohibiting them from participating in a matter \u201cinvolving specific parties that is directly and substantially related\u201d to former employers and clients.\n  For the pledge to be technically violated, there has to be a specific matter that causes a conflict, according to Delaney Marsco, the senior legal counsel for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center.\n  \u201cThe President has instituted the highest ethical standards of any administration ever,\u201d a White House spokesperson said. \u201cAnd as appointees, these staff members are subject to the pledge and accordingly, are recused from particular matters involving these former employers/clients (for two years from their date of appointment).\u201d\n  Technology companies have\u00a0increased their lobbying efforts in recent years \u2014 including, seemingly, by trying to exert direct influence on senior leaders.\n Amazon, for example,\u00a0hired   Jeff Ricchetti \u2014 the brother of Biden senior counselor  Steve Ricchetti \u2014 last year to lobby Congress, my colleagues Michael Scherer and Sean Sullivan\u00a0 reported  last week.\n  The company paid him $150,000 through March to lobby on the online marketplace and minimum-wage legislation, disclosures show.\n   Ricchetti no longer lobbies the \u201cWhite House Office\u201d for any clients and has not lobbied his brother, he said.\n Advocacy groups see some positive steps by the administration in selecting officials who could look closely at the power the companies wield.\n For example, the recent\u00a0 elevation  of Khan was cheered on by groups that want the major platforms to face greater Washington scrutiny.\n \u201cThere are competing impulses within the administration, and Lina Khan\u2019s selection is the apotheosis of that,\u201d Segal said.\n  Biden has yet to fill another slot on the FTC held by  Rohit Chopra. Biden\u00a0 picked  Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January.\n Biden has also brought on  Tim Wu, another critic of the tech industry&#39;s power, to work on competition and technology policy at the White House&#39;s National Economic Council.\n    It\u2019s the fourth investigation of a major technology company opened by the watchdog in the months since a digital competition law was enacted, the Financial Times\u2019s Erika Solomon   reports .\n  The investigation will focus on the company\u2019s App Store, \u201cas it enables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties,\u201d said Andreas Mundt, who leads Germany\u2019s Federal Cartel Office.\n  The company   told  Reuters that its App Store gives all German developers equal opportunities. \u201cWe look forward to discussing our approach with the FCO and having an open dialogue about any of their concerns,\u201d a representative said.\n Amazon tells employees in the United Kingdom to destroy millions of unsold items, an investigation found.\n  The products are destroyed because the cost of storing them in Amazon\u2019s Dunfermline warehouse is greater than the cost of destroying them, ITV\u2019s Richard Pallot   reports . Destroyed products have included electronic devices and sealed face masks, according to the report.\n  \u201cWe are working toward  a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organizations  or recycle any unsold products,\u201d the company said. \u201cNo items are sent to landfill in the U.K. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero.\u201d The company told   the Verge  that a landfill identified by ITV as a destination for some of the items is actually a recycling center.\n   Three Democratic senators blasted the company\u2019s \u201ccontinued failure to remove vaccine information from its platforms\u201d and asked for details on the number of posts with baseless vaccine-related claims on the platforms.\n  Sens.  Robert Menendez (D-N.J.),  Mark R. Warner  (D-Va.) and  Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) also asked the company for an explanation of the gap between its March 2019   announcement  that it would stop recommending groups that spread the claims and a February 2021   announcement  that it would remove false claims about the coronavirus and vaccines.\n  \u201cWe\u2019re working with health experts around the world to identify and address harmful claims about covid-19  and connect over 2 billion people to resources from health authorities, including through our covid-19  Information Center,\u201d  Facebook spokesman  Andy Stone said. \u201c We have removed more than 18 million pieces of content globally for breaking our rules on covid  misinformation and applied warning labels to over 167 million pieces of content rated false by more than 80 independent fact-checking partners who span 60 languages. We\u2019re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.\u201d\n  Google executives are worried that Google under CEO Sundar Pichai suffers from \u201ca paralyzing bureaucracy, a bias toward inaction and a fixation on public perception,\u201d the New York Times&#39;s Daisuke Wakabayashi  reports.

Speaking in a live  audio room on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg said the company is in the early stages of building camera-based search tools.\n The feature would be similar to ones offered by  Snapchat and  Pinterest, which have both invested heavily into visual search. Zuckerberg outlined two potential use cases for the technology on Instagram. When browsing Instagram, visual search could surface similar products available elsewhere in the app, or it could allow users to find products using their cameras or images from their camera roll.\n  \u201cWhen you find something you&#39;ll be able to tap on it and find similar products that people across all of our shops are selling the moment that you see something that you like,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe think that visual search is going to be really helpful in making photos shoppable Instagram overall.\u201d\n  In addition to visual search for Instagram, Zuckerberg also announced that  Facebook Shops will soon be arriving on Marketplace and WhatsApp. Facebook has already been integrating  product catalogs into WhatsApp chats, but now businesses will be able to create storefronts for the chat app.\n The company is also working on \u201cShops ads,\u201d which would allow businesses to target ads based on \u201cpeople\u2019s individual shopping preferences.\u201d Eventually, facebook could further personalize these ads with special offers or promotions, Zuckerberg said.\n   All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Effective C++,by  Scott Meyers, Item 17,that I found the most amazing trigger-happy footgun example:\n  std::shared_ptr is a reference countingimplementation: it will automatically destroy the object it owns when there isno more  std::shared_ptr owning it.\n  At first, I thought about a weird interaction between  std::shared_ptr and new, when the constructor of  Widget fails, but this case is  handledby the C++ runtime.\n The first trick here is that function parameters evaluation order is unspecified,meaning that  new Widget might be called, then  priority(), then the valuereturned by  new Widget is passed to  std::shared_ptr&lt;Widget&gt;(\u2026).The second one is there since this is C++,  priority() might raise an exception,meaning that  new Widget will be called, but never passed to std::shared_ptr, and thus never deleted!\n As  AnyOldName3 added after reading thisblogpost, this might be why there is   std::make_shared,with  std::make_shared&lt;Widget&gt;() being kinda equivalent

\u201c\u4ed6\u4eec \n...... ", "note_en": "They needed a song, but not just any song. It had to be a throat-clearing, lapel-grabbing, hey-what\u2019s-that-sound number that could open what was shaping up to be one of the most anticipated albums of 1970: the debut of the super group to end all super groups, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that song where you know that a listener will not take that needle off the record,\u201d Graham Nash told Stephen Stills sometime in the fall of 1969, after they\u2019d already labored for countless hours in a recording studio in San Francisco. \u201cWe need that song where we\u2019ve got them from the very beginning.\u201d\n  Nash, a skinny, shaggy former member of the British group The Hollies, and Stills, a soulful, straw-haired survivor of Buffalo Springfield, knew plenty about grabbing listeners by the ear. A year earlier, they\u2019d discovered \u2014 at Joni Mitchell\u2019s house in California, maybe, or Cass Elliot\u2019s, no one\u2019s quite sure \u2014 that they could create heavenly harmonies with David Crosby, the ex-Byrds singer who wore a droopy mustache, and the amused grin of a man who was in on some cosmic joke. They released an album,  Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, that was filled with instant classics like the soaring \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes.\u201d Then, at the urging of Ahmet Ertegun, the owlish Atlantic Records honcho, the trio turned themselves into a quartet, adding \u2014 with some reluctance \u2014 Neil Young\u2019s reedy voice, barbed-wire guitar playing, and unpredictability to the mix. After the four of them played in front of 400,000 swaying, stoned people at Woodstock, their own concerts started to take on the feel of what  Rolling Stone described as \u201c mini-Woodstocks\u201d that unleashed \u201ceffortless good vibes.\u201d\n    Expectations for their debut album were through the roof. Atlantic reported millions of pre-orders. But the recording process was far from smooth. Crosby was drowning in grief for his girlfriend, Christine Hinton, who\u2019d died in a car crash. Young proved to be only an occasional presence, playing on just half the album\u2019s tracks. Stills worked at a manic pace. Nash was driven to tears, one night, over the widespread dysfunction that threatened to derail the band, which was proving to be highly combustible as a quartet. Oh, and there was too much cocaine.\n    Kickstart your weekend reading by getting the week\u2019s best Longreads delivered to your inbox every Friday afternoon.\n      Then Stills came up with something. He played a jangly, chugging riff for Nash. \u201cHe sang me \u2018Carry On,\u2019\u201d Nash told me one March afternoon. We spoke over the phone, while Nash sheltered inside his New York City apartment, trying to avoid what was the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018That\u2019s it! We\u2019ve got it. If we cook that the way you just sang it to me, we\u2019ve got that opening track where we know that nobody will take the needle off the record after that.\u201d\n  Sure enough, \u201cCarry On\u201d was the perfect lead track for  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, the album they released in March 1970. Fueled by a blend of plaintive acoustic songs, paeans to domesticity, and occasionally snarling guitars, it went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts and ultimately sold eight million copies. While this success seemed to announce the arrival of the music industry\u2019s Next Big Thing, other once-harmonious superstar acts were simultaneously cracking under the weight of infighting and simmering resentments, and releasing their final albums together: Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel\u2019s  Bridge Over Troubled Water, and the Beatles\u2019  Let It Be. Could Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young be to the \u201870s what the Beatles had been to the \u201860s \u2014 a musical guidepost for millions of people? For most bands, that would have been an impossible proposition. But a few months after  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu hit record store shelves, CSNY channeled the horror of the Kent State massacre into a generational anthem, the defiant and urgent single \u201cOhio,\u201d proving they were more than capable of creating a meaningful dialogue with listeners about the turmoil of their era.\n  But the band didn\u2019t use this promising start as a stepping stone to a second studio album together; instead, each member started working on solo records. \u201cI had to break away,\u201d Young would later write in his memoir,  Waging Heavy Peace. \u201c\u2026The band didn\u2019t break up; it just stopped. It did not regenerate itself. It stopped functioning, like it had a lapse or a heart attack or something. No new songs came forward from anyone.\u201d\n    Three years later, in the spring of 1973, the musicians embarked on the first of what would be multiple attempted reunions, gathering in paradise: the Mala Wharf in Maui, where Young had rented a house. Everyone brought new songs. An easy camaraderie took hold, and with it, a chance to recapture what they had lost so quickly \u2014 the ability to create music that was strong enough to overcome the tensions that so easily divided them. They tentatively named their new project  Human Highway.\n  \u201cWe all went there and hung out for a week or so, learning the songs and trying to figure out the album,\u201d Nash said. They even posed for a photo that was meant to grace the album cover. It showed four brothers, tanned and bearded, arranged together in front of a blue sky, looking less glum than they did on  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. \u201cAnd then something happened. I\u2019m not even sure what happened now, it was so long ago,\u201d Nash said. \u201cBut those plans were shelved, and we went on with the rest of our lives.\u201d\n  In the months and years that followed, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young would take several ill-fated stabs at recording  Human Highway. Fans would speculate about the lost project for years, piecing together theoretical track lists from songs that were released sporadically. The story of the album was, in a way, the story of the band \u2014 prolific but wholly different talents, drawn to each other\u2019s music, repelled by egos and infighting and drugs, locked in a cycle that would leave them splintered and bitter even now, five decades later, as they approach the sunset of their lives. But in a surprising twist, the member most opposed to reuniting \u2014 Neil Young \u2014  recently gave the public an intriguing glimpse of what  Human Highway could have been, and rekindled his ex-bandmates\u2019 interest in seeing the project find some sort of late-stage redemption.\n        The idyllic Maui brainstorming sessions were, unfortunately, a template for how the band would operate for years to come, with so many embers of magic stamped out, in a huff, by one member or another. Nash, in his memoir  Wild Tales, recalled that \u201csome business, some cocaine thing, went down, and suddenly we weren\u2019t talking to each other.\u201d But within a few months, the band was back on good terms, and gathered at Young\u2019s sprawling Broken Arrow Ranch in Redwood City, California, to tackle their new material.\n  \u201cHuman Highway\u201d was the work of Young, in full rustic-troubadour mode, and sounded like another potential CSNY classic when they debuted it during an impromptu live performance later in 1973. Stills had \u201cSee the Changes,\u201d an airy song about maturity that was well suited for the band\u2019s lush harmonies. Nash, meanwhile, offered a handful of songs that were several shades darker than what he\u2019d contributed to  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu: \u201cAnd So It Goes,\u201d \u201cWind on the Water,\u201d and \u201cPrison Song,\u201d which railed against criminal justice policies that unfairly punished the poor. Crosby had written \u201cCarry Me,\u201d a tribute to his recently deceased mother, and the meditative \u201cTime After Time.\u201d \u201cWe had great songs. It was going to be a great album,\u201d Nash told me. \u201cWe had a great title.  Human Highway? Are you kidding me? That\u2019s fabulous.\u201d\n    During the three years that followed  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, each of the four musicians had released solo albums \u2014 in Young\u2019s case, two of his most critically lauded,  After the Gold Rush and  Harvest \u2014 that proved they could thrive on their own. But there was no denying that a group project still held some allure. Young later wrote with surprising fondness about how he viewed his sometime collaborators: Crosby was the catalyst who pushed everyone further; Nash, the consummate professional who wrote the group\u2019s most recognizable songs; while Stills was Young\u2019s conflicted \u201cbrother.\u201d\n  Yet work on the ranch proved slow. \u201cThat studio is like a log cabin,\u201d said drummer Johny Barbata, who\u2019d played with the band on  4 Way Street, a live album released in 1971. \u201cWe were in there, and it was a really cool environment, but I don\u2019t remember getting much done.\u201d Barbata had seen how easily things could go south between the band\u2019s four stars. He recalls one concert performance being interrupted, mid-show, by a backstage argument between Nash and Stills over the number of songs Stills had played during an acoustic set. \u201cBoy, Graham was on him,\u201d Barbata said, \u201cand Stephen was bending a beer can in his hand.\u201d\n  There is a certain amount of romance and mystery associated with the idea of a lost album, a sense that an artist\u2019s career might have turned out differently if they had completed a passion project that eluded their grasp. But in his book  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: The Wild, Definitive Saga of Rock\u2019s Greatest Supergroup, author David Browne described the rehearsals at Young\u2019s ranch as dysfunctional and uninspired, with Stills sleeping all day while his bandmates were preoccupied by televised footage of the Watergate hearings that would presage the resignation of President Richard Nixon, the villain of \u201cOhio.\u201d\n  \u201cI showed up to play . . . and one day we stopped playing. I just don\u2019t know,\u201d Stills explained to journalist Cameron Crowe in 1974. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about how incredibly famous we are or how we could set the world on fire if we got back together. I want to play. I want to sing. I want to make good records. And if that doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m gone.\u201d The musicians had managed to overcome multiple stumbling blocks during the recording sessions for  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, and emerged on the other side with a cultural touchstone and enduring songs: \u201cTeach Your Children,\u201d \u201cHelpless,\u201d \u201cOur House.\u201d That success now seemed like a rare moment of creative symbiosis they couldn\u2019t repeat, even with material that was worth the effort. \u201cBut this band has never played by the rules of any band that I know of,\u201d Nash told me. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a little strange. It\u2019s always been a little weird.\u201d\n  Highway had derailed. \u201cIt\u2019s the  Smile of the seventies,\u201d Browne said, invoking Brian Wilson\u2019s mythical 1960s masterpiece, which sat unfinished for decades. \u201cThey were at a point in their career where their singing was still strong. There was a lot of indulgence going on, but their singing was still strong. They hadn\u2019t blown their voices out in \u201873 or \u201874. They were still at the top of their game. It would\u2019ve been a more mature, wiser, beaten up  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. And so yeah, you\u2019re kind of reminded all over again, what a missed opportunity.\u201d\n  But they didn\u2019t stay away from each other for long. In 1974, they were lured back together by a massive stadium tour that promised to generate record-setting sums of money for them, creating a template for rock star excess \u2014 fancy hotel rooms, lavish amounts of food and drugs, too many groupies to count \u2014 along the way. The band rehearsed on Young\u2019s ranch, where they recorded several demos, including a Young song, \u201cThrough My Sails,\u201d that he would release in 1975 on  Zuma, an album he recorded with the band Crazy Horse. Only two minutes and forty seconds long, the song is light and breezy \u2014 just an acoustic guitar and a soft beat, with Crosby, Stills, and Nash\u2019s sweet harmonies effortlessly lifting Young\u2019s verses into the sublime, a reminder of how good they could sound once they cut through the bullshit.\n    \u201cWe are such different people and we write so differently that it gives us what I like to call a much wider palette out of which to paint the album, much more than most people have,\u201d Crosby wrote, years later, in his autobiography  Long Time Gone. (He declined to be interviewed for this story; Stills couldn\u2019t be reached.) Barbata observed a degree of competition, too. \u201cStephen and Neil were great writing partners, like  Lennon and McCartney, kind of trying to write better songs than the other guy,\u201d he told me. \u201cCrosby and Nash were like buddies together.\u201d\n  The \u201974 tour afforded them a chance to air out some potential  Human Highway material\u2014 Crosby\u2019s \u201cTime After Time\u201d and \u201cCarry Me,\u201d Young\u2019s rumbling rocker \u201cPushed It Over The End,\u201d Stills\u2019 Santana-esque \u201cMy Angel\u201d\u2014 and after the tour ended, the band gathered at Nash\u2019s house, in San Francisco, to try to resurrect the album in his basement studio. Instead, they bickered like petulant school kids. Stills and Nash argued about a vocal part, and then Stills used a razor to slice up one of Nash\u2019s demo tapes. Nash responded by kicking Stills out of his house. \u201cThe pressure for that group [CSNY] to happen again is a destructive force on us all,\u201d Stills would complain years later.\n  Over-the-top feuds are a staple of the rock band archetype, but most successful groups find a way to tolerate each other long enough to get down to business. \u201cWith these guys,\u201d Browne said, \u201cthings would just blow up and end.\u201d The quartet attempted to continue on at the Record Plant, where they worked on a Crosby song, \u201cHomeward Through the Haze,\u201d which built to a chorus about \u201cthe blind leading the blind.\u201d This effort soon ended with Young abandoning the sessions, without offering his bandmates an explanation. Crosby later summed things up with deadpan understatement: \u201cWe always had a fair amount of conflict between us.\u201d But they weren\u2019t done with each other yet.\n    We\u2019re running in rhyme  In a slow easy climb  Up the road that\u2019ll we run together\n    Crosby and Nash discovered they could have a smoother time performing as a duo, playing theaters instead of stadiums, and recorded a pair of melodic albums in the mid-70s \u2014  Wind on the Water and  Whistling Down the Wire \u2014 that became a home for some of the songs they\u2019d meant for  Human Highway. CSNY was firmly in their rearview mirror.\n  Then Stills called drummer Joe Vitale in 1976, inviting him to Criteria Studios in Florida. \u201cHe said, \u201cHey, I have two surprises. We\u2019re gonna start a Crosby, Stills, and Nash record,\u2019\u201d Vitale told me. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018That\u2019s really amazing. What\u2019s the second surprise?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Neil\u2019s coming.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019\u201d\n  Stills and Young had planned only to record an album\u2019s worth of songs together. But when the bulk of the project was in the can, Young paid a visit to an old friend on the West Coast. Nash remembers being contacted by Young, \u201cand he said that he was working in Miami with Stephen, and wouldn\u2019t David and I be interested in going down and singing on some of the songs? And he sent us some of the songs, and they were great songs \u2014 \u2018Midnight on the Bay,\u2019 and stuff like that. And so we went and spent about two weeks putting vocals onto all of the tracks.\u201d\n    We count on member support to bring you thought-provoking essays. Please consider a one-time, or \u2014 better yet \u2014 a recurring annual or monthly contribution. Every dollar counts!\n      Crosby and Nash added their rich harmonies to one song after another \u2014 \u201cOcean Girl,\u201d \u201cMidnight on the Bay,\u201d \u201cLong May You Run,\u201d even \u201cHuman Highway\u201d\u2014 and the record unmistakably became a CSNY reunion. Vitale wistfully recalled a memory from those sessions: watching Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young sit with their guitars in a circle, separated by just a few feet, as they recorded live, the years and any past grudges melting away. \u201cIt was the blend of their voices,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just unbelievable how good they were.\u201d\n  Outside the walls of Criteria Studios, Americans\u2019 taste in music was undergoing a shift. Disco songs like \u201cBoogie Fever\u201d and \u201cLove Machine\u201d were starting to occupy a noticeable amount of pop chart real estate. But there was still an appetite for CSNY and other artists who mined similar veins of pop and folk-rock \u2014 Linda Ronstadt , James Taylor, the Eagles, and a legion of imitators.\n  The promise of more success, and a batch of strong songs, should have been enough to persuade the band to get the project to the finish line. \u201cIt\u2019s usually the songs that bring us together. Because if Stephen has four and Neil has four and David has four and I have four songs, we\u2019ve all got a project to work on, and we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Nash said. \u201cSo it usually comes down to, the songs drive our relationship in many ways.\u201d\n  Yet the cooperative atmosphere once again soured. As Nash tells it, he and Crosby were due back in Los Angeles, to finish  Whistling Down the Wire. When they explained that they had to leave, the reunion came to a screeching halt. Stills and Young were committed to a looming tour, and needed the album of songs they were recording in Florida to be ready; they couldn\u2019t wait for the other two to return. The news apparently rankled Young. The musicians had been staying in Miami, at the appropriately-named Mutiny Hotel. Nash, who described the hotel as \u201cseventeen floors of cocaine dealers,\u201d learned from an employee that Young had checked out abruptly and headed back to California.\n  In what could only be read as a spiteful move, Young stripped Nash\u2019s and Crosby\u2019s vocals off the songs they\u2019d recorded, and released the tracks on an album called  The Stills-Young Band. \u201cI never should have erased that,\u201d Young would later tell an interviewer. \u201cBut I thought I was doing the right thing at the right time.\u201d\n      Nash still puzzles over it. \u201cAnd to this day, I still have no idea whether they actually wiped me and David\u2019s tracks, or whether they were smart enough to make a 16-track copy of that and then do overdubs to the copy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I still don\u2019t know where any of those vocal tracks went to. I do have rough mixes that were made on the last couple of days that we were there, and they sound fabulous to me.\u201d When we spoke in the spring, Nash had no way of knowing that the mystery surrounding those missing vocals would be resolved months later \u2014 44 years after things had ended so badly in Florida.\n      The quartet made no other attempt to complete the studio album they first started toying with in 1973. \u201cWe tried to put it together with Neil, but it wasn\u2019t happening. Let\u2019s be diplomatic and say that it was a conflict between me and Stephen or me and Nash and Stephen,\u201d Crosby would later explain. \u201cFor whatever reason, it didn\u2019t work. The rapport between us did not transcend our personal problems. \u2026 We have traditionally gotten too drunk or too loaded or too high or too screwed up to keep our shit together.\u201d\n  But CSNY\u2019s on-again, off-again relationship soon became the least of Crosby\u2019s problems. While getting high had been as much a staple of his life during the \u201860s and \u201870s as writing and singing songs, the 1980s found him consumed by even more dangerous addictions: he freebased cocaine, then began using heroin. To Nash and Stills, Crosby became a friend they couldn\u2019t reach, and a partner upon whom they couldn\u2019t rely. \u201cI would take my life\u2019s steering wheel and turn it to the right and my life would veer sharply to the left,\u201d Crosby would later recall. He was arrested on multiple occasions, and ultimately did time in a Texas state prison. Young made a public promise that was intended to lure his old bandmate out of the darkness: If Crosby could get clean, Young would commit to a CSNY reunion.\n  To Young\u2019s credit, he made good on his vow. In 1986, CSNY played together at a charity concert, and then began working on a studio album,  American Dream, which was released in 1988 . It sold well, but found the band trapped in glossy \u201880s production, with little of the yearning or magic that flowed so freely from  D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. Eleven years later, CSNY recorded another surprise reunion album,  Looking Forward. On songs like Young\u2019s tender \u201cSlowpoke,\u201d Crosby, Stills, and Nash added harmonies that came close to approximating the sweet sound of their youth. But they were not the same band anymore, not really. \u201cThey\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 04:26:09", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e13\u8f91,stills,\u6b4c\u66f2", "title": "\u514b\u7f57\u65af\u6bd4\uff0c\u5267\u7167\uff0c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u548c\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u4e13\u8f91\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def ", "title_en": "Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young\u2019s lost album, Human Highway", "transed": 1, "url": "https://longreads.com/2021/03/30/crosby-stills-nash-youngs-lost-album-human-highway/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e13\u8f91", "stills", "\u6b4c\u66f2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067546, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.\n  Saffron,  Crocus sativus (Iridaceae), is a perennial herb, which earned its popularity as both medicine and spice. It is an inhabitant of different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, and India. The benefits of saffron as an antidepressant are well-documented. Almost 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds are obtained from the chemical analysis of this plant. Fewer than 50 constituents elucidated and identified so far showed phytochemical characteristics. The major bioactive compounds identified are safranal, crocin, and picrocrocin, which are responsible for its aroma as well as its bitter taste. This review is an attempt to encompass the methods of analysis and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of saffron followed by its efficacious and safe potential.\n Crocus sativus L. belonging to Iridaceae family, commonly known as saffron, is a perennial herb widely cultivated in Iran and other countries, such as India and Greece. Commercial saffron is a spice comprises of dried red stigma with a small portion of the yellowish style attached to the flower of  Crocus sativus L., in Chinese its known as Fan-Hong-Hua. From decades saffron was used in traditional Chinese medicines for its expectorant, aphrodisiac, and antispasmodic effects.[ ] Saffron can be planted from an altitude of sea level to almost 2000 m, but it is more preferably adapted to hill sides and mountain valleys, ranging in altitudes between 600 and 1700 m.[ 2] Also, this plant can be cultivated in a dry and infertile place where there is an extreme water shortage in summer. The origin of the word saffron is the French term \u201cSafran,\u201d which was derived from the Latin word \u201csafranum\u201d and yellowish in color, phytochemical analysis have revealed that the color is mainly because of the degraded carotenoid compounds, crocin and crocetin.[ ] This is one of the valuable herb in the world because it requires properly plucked stigma from the flowers. Variation and high quality of final products are due to the harvest process involved.[ ]\n Saffron has been famous as both medicine and spice in some cultures. The stigma of saffron has been used as a medicine over 3600 years ago.[ ] Saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries).[ ] Also, saffron has been used in coloring tunics in the region of Spain and by the Babylonian culture around 2400 BC.[ 7] This expensive spice can be found in different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, or Kashmir.[ 7] Each of the flowers has three red-colored stigma, and one stigma of saffron weighs approximately 2 mg. Approximately 1 kg of this valuable spice is made from 150,000 flowers that must be carefully picked.[ ]\n One of the most established findings regarding the benefits of saffron is its antidepressant activity. There are clinical trials conducted, evaluating the efficacy of saffron in mild-to-moderate depression. The studies reported that saffron was more effective than placebo and at least equivalent to the therapeutic doses of imipramine and fluoxetine. One of the top five most predominant diseases worldwide is depression.[ ] Depression can affect the quality of life of someone because of the facts that it can cause a headache, difficulty in thinking, and loss of interest.\n Recently, approximately 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds have been detected from the chemical analysis of  C. sativus L. However, fewer than 50 constituents have been identified so far as the phytochemicals of  C. sativus L. The major constituents of saffron are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 9] The phytochemical agents in saffron are responsible for many pharmacological actions in the body. The phytochemical research has found that the color of saffron is mainly because of the degraded compound of carotenoids, which are crocin and crocetin.[ ] Many clinical studies focused more on the antidepressant effects of saffron.\n Saffron has intensive fragrant with slightly bitter taste and produces a bright yellow-orange solution when soaked in warm water.[ 10] Its stigma was shown to contain carbohydrates, minerals, mucilage, vitamins B1 and B2, and pigments. Crocin, crocetin, carotene, lycopene, and gigantic[ ] anthocyanin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin are the oil-soluble pigments that can be found in the stigma.[ 12] The color of saffron is the result of degradation of carotenoid compounds named crocin. According to Wallis,[ 13] crocin constituent of saffron, which highly related to its intense color, is the natural water-soluble carotenoid. Crocetin in  C. sativus L. is a water-insoluble conjugated polyene with two carboxylic acid residues.[ 14] Crocetin esters or also known as crocin, which is hydrophilic and water soluble, are usually found in the saffron extract in which \u03b1-crocin, the glycosyl ester of crocetin, is the main contributor for the significant bright yellow-orange color of saffron.[ 15] Saffron has a unique flavor that is related mainly to the glycoside picrocrocin.[ 16] Picrocrocin is responsible for the unique flavor of  C. sativus L., which is found to be stable in fresh raw saffron and broken down when heated to release.[ ] Specific essential oils of the flower contribute to the sweet fragrance of saffron. The principal constituent of total essential oil of  C. sativus L., safranal is a carboxaldehyde volatile compound formed by deglucosylation of picrocrocin.[ 16] Saffron is widely used in food processing industry as colorant and flavoring agents. The essential oils also comprised several terpene aldehydes, ketones, and terpene derivatives (pinene and cineol).[ 10] The secondary metabolites present in the petals of  C. sativus L. are tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, which include rutin, quercetin, luteolin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids. Those compounds have been reported to have many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory,[ ] antinociceptive,[ ] and blood pressure lowering effects.[ ]\n All  trans and  cis isomers of crocin reflect the characteristics of carotenoids by having ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectra highlighting double peaks between 400 and 500 nm in the visible region.[ 21] Safranal is responsible for aroma, whereas its precursor picrocrocin, which is a monoterpene glycoside, is accountable for the bitter taste of saffron.[ 21] The pattern of UV absorption of picrocrocin can be seen with a broad band at 250 nm with the maximum absorption of 254 nm, reflecting the presence of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated cycloaldehyde functional group in its molecular structure.[ 22] Picrocrocin underwent enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis to produce glucose and aglycone and then yielded safranal via dehydration during drying process.[ 22] Active components that indicate the quality and pharmacological studies of saffron are the enzymatic oxidative metabolites of glucoside derivative of zeaxanthin, which include  cis- and  trans-crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 23] The main phytochemicals that may contribute to the biological activities of  C. sativus L. are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.\n Crocin and saffron extract had been revealed to prevent memory and spatial learning impairment because of chronic-induced stress.[ ] Prophylactic property of saffron against memory deficiency had been proposed to occur as the result of the correlation between the antioxidant activity of saffron and the impairment because of oxidative stress.[ 21] Akhondzadeh  et al.,[ ] in 2004, had shown saffron extract to be equally efficient to imipramine during double-blind and randomized trial conducted over 6 weeks. The dried saffron petal also had been revealed to be effective in mild-to-moderate depression based on 6 weeks of double-blind randomized clinical trials.[ ] Crocin (30 mg/day), the main antioxidant constituent of saffron stigmas, was shown to amplify the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating patients with mild-to-moderate depression with the absence of substantial side effects based on the observation of 4 weeks of randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial with 40 patients of major depressive disorder.[ ] Scientifically proven traditional uses of saffron as antidepressant suggested that crocin exerts its antidepressant effect by increasing cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor inducible levels in rat hippocampus.[ ] Subacute administration of crocin was indicated to cause antidepressant effects in the rat. When saffron capsules administered to patients with a prior history of percutaneous coronary intervention who had depression, it was found to be equally effective as fluoxetine.[ ] In one of the 6-week pilot double-blind, randomized trial, the petal of the  C. sativus L. was found to be equally valid with the stigma in the treatment of depressed outpatients.[ 30] The petal constituent of  C. sativus L., kaempferol, was revealed to have antidepressant effect when evaluated using forced swimming test in mice and rats.[ 31] It has been perceived that current findings of biological activities of  C. sativus L., particularly its main constituent crocin, supported its medicinal used in traditional practices.\n According to Murray and Lopez,[ ] depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases and has been estimated to affect up to 21% of the world\u2019s population. Majority of patients are often reluctant to take synthetic antidepressant drugs in their appropriate doses because of the anticipated side effects such as the inability to drive a car, dry mouth, constipation, and libido.[ ] Hence, plant extracts are some of the most attractive sources of new drugs and have been shown to produce a better result with low side effects in the treatment of depression.[ ]\n C. sativus L. or commonly known as saffron is an expensive traditional spice. Its active components have shown several useful pharmacological effects such as anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, radical scavenger effects, and learning and memory-improving effects.[ ] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ 30] stated that saffron had been widely used to relieve stomachaches, ease the pain of kidney stones, and treat depression in Persian traditional medicine.\n According to Srivastava  et al.,[ ] two active ingredients of  C. sativus L., which are crocin and safranal, have shown antidepressant effects. This is in accordance to the study carried out by Hosseinzadeh  et al.,[ 35] regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of  C. sativus L. stigma and their constituents, safranal and crocin, for the antidepressant activity by using forced swimming test in mice. The result obtained shows that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stigma (0.2\u20130.8 g/kg), safranal (0.15\u20130.5 mL/kg), and crocin (50\u2013600 mg/kg) could reduce the immobility time of the mice and the swimming time increased greatly. It is suggested that the inhabitation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake by crocin and safranal might be the possible mechanism of antidepressive effect of saffron.[ 30] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ ] also conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of saffron with imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In another study, patients were assigned to receive capsule saffron (30 mg/day) three times a day (tds) or capsule imipramine (100 mg/day tds) for a 6-week research.[ ] The result showed that saffron at this dose was found to be effective comparable to imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression.\n Because the stigma of  C. sativus L. (saffron) is very expensive, the researchers use the leaves of this plant as it is cheaper and possesses antidepressant effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial performed by Srivastava  et al.,[ ] 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of the petal of  C. sativus L. at dose of (30 mg/day) twice daily (bd) and capsule of placebo twice daily (bd) for a 6-week study. At 6 weeks, the petal of  C. sativus L. produced a significantly better outcome on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale than placebo. Hence, it is proven that the petal of  C. sativus L. does give antidepressant effect. Karimi  et al.[ 36] also conducted a study regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stigma and petal of  C. sativus L. for the antidepressant activity according to the forced swimming test in mice. It was shown that both stigma and petal reduced immobility time of the mice. In a double-blind and randomized trial performed by Akhondzadeh Basti  et al.,[ ] patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of petal of  C. sativus L. (15 mg bid) (Group 1) and fluoxetine (10 mg bid) (Group 2) for an 8-week study. At the end of the trial, the petal of  C. sativus L. was found to be effective as similar to fluoxetine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In study by Melnyk  et al. (2010), kaempferol (the active constituent in saffron petals) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg in mice and 50 mg/kg in rat reduces depressive symptoms similar to fluoxetine.[ 37] Wang  et al.[ ] also conducted research regarding the antidepressant properties of stigmas and corms of  C. sativus L. The corms of  C. sativus L. were fractionated based on polarity and yielded petroleum ether fraction and dichloromethane fraction. At doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg, it showed significant antidepressant-like activities as the immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspending test was significantly reduced by these two fractions.\n Hausenblas  et al.[ ] stated that, similar to antidepressants, saffron may exert its antidepressant effect by modulating the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin (a mood-elevating neurotransmitter). Although it has been proposed that saffron increases serotonin levels in the brain, the exact mechanism of action for this is unknown. More specifically, a saffron extract might inhibit serotonin reuptake in synapses. Inhibiting synaptic serotonin reuptake keeps serotonin in the brain longer, thereby enhancing its positive effects while combating depression.\n Several analytical methods have been developed for the systematic separation and quantification of saffron ( C. sativus L.) metabolites.[ ] Several methodologies have been reported using different analytical tools to analyze the bioactive constituents of saffron, that is, picrocrocin, safranal, and crocin.[ , 40, 41, 42, 43] UV-vis spectrometry method is recommended by the International Standardization Organization to characterize the quality of saffron. The technique has been used for quality and stability studies of saffron, whereby the process is considered to be appropriate for recognizing the taste, color, and flavor of the spice (ISO/TS 3632, 2003). However, this method is not suitable for the identification and quantification of each component of saffron extract. This is because the technique is not specific and cannot adequately separate. Hence, because of mentioned reasons, the advanced stationary phases of analytical and preparative methods have been developed such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, multilayer coil counter current chromatography with silica gel, aluminum oxide, and Sephadex LH-20.[ 41, 42, 44, ]\n Tarantilis  et al.[ ] and Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] in their studies reported other analytical methods such as reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled together with mass spectrometry and photodiode array detector, and for the detection of volatile compounds, gas chromatography with mass spectrometer (MS).\n Most of the studies conducted have been focused on the analytical determination of the structure of crocin. However, the methods to isolate high-purity crocin have not been established.[ , 46] To obtain adequately pure crocin, the compound is first separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and then by preparative HPLC.[ 42] Through this method, crocin can only maximally be separated to seven fractions. The method also implies repeated procedures, which are time-consuming, before purified crocin can be isolated. A simple two-step method in which 20 fractions of crocin are separated simultaneously in the first step, and then high-purity pigment is obtained in a subsequent step has been reported by Zhang  et al.[ 46] The purity of the crocin compound was reported to be above 95%, whereby the methods used two-step, low-pressure liquid chromatography without preparative HPLC. Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] reported that isolation method namely micro-simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction and vacuum head space were more suitable to isolate the aroma components of saffron as compared to standard distillation method. Another method for the separation of crocin reported was crystallization, whereby the amount of obtained crocin from the first crystallization step was 17% of the stigma powder, but its purity was approximately 85%. The purity increased to more than 97% after a second crystallization step was performed. Therefore, the total amount of crocin obtained is 10% from the initial stigma powder of saffron.[ ]\n Other than the investigation of the biological activities of crocetin and crocin, it is also important to determine the pharmacokinetic aspects of the compounds such as its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. Until now, most of the studies were carried out using  in vitro and  in vivo animal model, which mainly focuses on the absorption and metabolism parameters. Also, the review of the pharmacokinetic profile of those compounds in human body remains inadequate. A study was conducted by Umigai  et al.[ ] on 10 healthy human volunteers with a single dose of crocetin orally administered at three doses (7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg) in the 1-week interval to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma crocetin by using RP-HPLC. They reported that crocetin was rapidly absorbed and detected in the plasma within 1h and reached a peak of mean maximum plasma concentration, C max (100.9\u2013279.7 ng/ml) around 4\u20134.8 h. The C max value was also reported to be increasing in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the mean elimination half-life of crocetin, T 1/2, in human plasma was also ranging from 6.1 to 7.5 h.[ ]\n In pharmacokinetic study, one of the factors affecting the bioavailability of a compound is its solubility and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. The research carried out by Xi  et al.[ ] using HPLC observed that crocin remained undetected in the serum of tested rats, regardless of gender, following single or repeated doses of oral administration. However, its hydrolysis product, crocetin, was found in low concentration in the serum. Crocin also was excreted mainly in feces. Besides, following repeated oral doses of crocin, no accumulation of crocetin was found in the serum.[ ] This suggests that crocin is hydrolyzed in the intestine into crocetin before being absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration. In detail, on the basis of  in vitro study, crocin was reported to get hydrolyzed into deglycosylated  trans-crocetin and subsequently, absorbed by passive transcellular diffusion to a high extent

", "note_en": "More than 1 billion records for CVS Health customers were left in the database of a third-party, unnamed vendor \u2013 exposed, unprotected, online. Researchers said the data points revealed could be strung together to create an extremely personal snapshot of someones\u2019s medical situation.\n The glitch is likely due to human error, security researcher Jeremiah Fowler said in a  post on WebsitePlanet on Thursday: In other words, it\u2019s probably yet another incidence of  rampant misconfiguration that\u2019s plaguing cloud-based storage, leading to exposure of sensitive data on an internal network.\n According to Fowler\u2019s post, researchers at WebsitePlanet \u2013 a portal for web developers and internet marketers \u2013 found the non-password-protected database, which had no form of authentication in place to prevent unauthorized entry, on March 21. They coordinated with Fowler in documenting their discovery and on that same day, after they contacted CVS Health, the naked database was closed off from public view.\n  CVS Health is the parent company behind multiple household brands, including the CVS Pharmacy retail pharmacy chain; CVS Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager; and Aetna, a health insurance provider.\n A CVS spokesperson confirmed the researchers\u2019 findings, saying that CVS Health had been notified of the exposure of a publicly accessible database that contained non-identifiable CVS Health metadata. Upon investigation, they determined that the database was hosted by a third-party vendor, whose name the company didn\u2019t disclose. The database didn\u2019t contain any personally identifiable information (PII) of customers, members or patients, the company said in a statement, and the database was quickly taken down.\n As the researcher\u2019s report indicates, there was no risk to customers, members or patients, and we worked with the vendor to quickly take the database down. We\u2019ve addressed the issue with the vendor to prevent a recurrence and we thank the researcher who notified us about this matter. \u2014CVS Health statement.\n  Fowler said in his post that there was in fact enough information to derive customers\u2019 PII, including their email addresses. The total size of the database was 204 GB, according to the researchers. It held 1.1 billion records, or, to be precise, 1,148,327,940 files. They were labeled \u201cproduction\u201d and included information typed into search bars, such as the data types  add to cart, configuration, dashboard, index-pattern, more refinements, order, remove from cart, search, server.\n The records also exposed fields called Visitor ID, Session ID and device information, such as whether customers were using an iPhone, an Android, an iPad or a desktop PC. The team noted that by stringing together the data, they could reveal emails that could be targeted in a phishing attack, in social engineering, or \u201cpotentially used to cross-reference other actions.\u201d\n  As well, the files gave a \u201cclear understanding of configuration settings, where data is stored and a blueprint of how the logging service operates from the backend,\u201d according to the advisory.\n In looking for PII, the researchers performed several search queries for common email extensions, such as Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo, they said. They were rewarded with results for each query within the dataset, indicating that the records did in fact contain email addresses. Fowler said that, given how many personal email addresses are formatted using portions or all of the user\u2019s name, he was able to identify \u201ca small sampling of individuals by simply searching Google for the publicly exposed email address.\u201d\n The records also contained the data types  Visitor ID and  Session ID, indicating the items that visitors searched for, including medications, COVID-19 vaccines and other CVS products. All of this data, strung together, could have created a snapshot of private details about individuals\u2019 health, Fowler said.\n \u201cHypothetically, it could have been possible to match the Session ID with what they searched for or added to the shopping cart during that session and then try to identify the customer using the exposed emails,\u201d he said in the advisory.\n  The CVS representative who dealt with the researchers said that whatever emails were found in the database didn\u2019t come from CVS customer accounts. Rather, they were entered into the search bar by visitors themselves \u2013 presumably, by mistake.\n \u201cThe search bar captures and logs everything that is entered into the website\u2019s search function and these records were stored as log files,\u201d the advisory explained. \u201cWhen reviewing the mobile version of the CVS site it is a possible theory that visitors may have believed they were logging into their account, but were really entering their email address into the search bar.\u201d\n The searches were formatted as  event type parameters and were set to  search. The email addresses are values for a parameter named  query, Fowler continued, which \u201ccould explain how so many email addresses ended up in a database of product searches that was not intended to identify the visitor.\u201d\n In addition, the records show what device customers used, with a majority of the searches coming from phones and mobile devices such as iPhones or Androids, as well as some searches coming from desktop computers.\n  Unfortunately, the activity logging that exposed all this information is a \u201cnecessary evil,\u201d the team observed \u2013 one that can lead to the exposure of sensitive records.\n \u201cTracking all activity from a website or ecommerce platform helps build valuable insights about visitors and customers,\u201d the advisory explained. \u201cThis logging and tracking can often contain metadata or error logs that inadvertently expose more sensitive records.\u201d\n The exposed search logs were from searches done on both CVS Health and CVS.com, and provided \u201cvaluable analytical data to see what customers are looking for and if they are finding the products they want,\u201d the team said. That includes the possibility that data about configuration, applications, software, operating systems and build information were exposed: data that could identify potential vulnerabilities if they were unpatched or outdated.\n That\u2019s information that cybercriminals or adversarial nation-states can exploit, the team said. \u201cOften they use the same methods as legitimate security researchers to identify publicly exposed data,\u201d according to the advisory. \u201cEach record of information serves as a puzzle piece to provide a larger picture of an organization\u2019s network or data-storage methods.\u201d\n  Thanks to the explosive growth of cloud-based data storage, misconfigurations like these are becoming all too common, said PJ Norris, senior systems engineer at cybersecurity company Tripwire. \u201cExposing sensitive data doesn\u2019t require a sophisticated vulnerability, and the rapid growth of cloud-based data storage has exposed weaknesses in processes that leave data available to anyone,\u201d he said via email to Threatpost on Thursday.\n In September, a survey of 2,064 Google Cloud buckets from Comparitech found that 6 percent of all  Google Cloud buckets are misconfigured, left open to the public internet for anybody and everybody to see \u2013 including passports, birth certificates and personal profiles from children in India, and a Russian web developer\u2019s email server credentials and chat logs.\n In March, arts-and-crafts retailer  Hobby Lobby left 138GB of sensitive information open to the public internet \u2013 including a slew of customer information \u2013 due to a cloud-bucket misconfiguration.\n \u201cA misconfigured database on an internal network might not be noticed, and if noticed, might not go public, but the stakes are higher when your data storage is directly connected to the Internet,\u201d Norris noted. \u201cOrganizations should identify processes for securely configuring all systems, including cloud-based storage, like Elasticsearch and Amazon S3. Once a process is in place, the systems must be monitored for changes to their configurations. These are solvable problems, and tools exist today to help.\u201d\n  Ray Canzanese, threat research director at Netskope, said that the CVS Health exposure is common in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure and Google Cloud. Common misconfigurations crop up in security groups, network ACLs (NACLs) and firewall rules, he said via email to Threatpost on Thursday. In fact, Netskope recently analyzed public exposure of compute infrastructure in IaaS environments across the three major IaaS providers, and found that over 35 percent of compute instances expose at least one service to the Internet.\n Netskope recommended that, to avoid such exposures, organizations should scan their own cloud environments automatically to discover and lock down exposed resources. Canzanese also recommended zero-trust network architecture\u00a0 as a means to give employees secure access to cloud resources, whether they are hosted on-prem or in the cloud, without exposing them to the internet.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on   Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET  in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

The truth is that documentation can make or break someone\u2019s success with your software. Often, developers form their first impressions through docs, even before they make it to the product. Bringing documentation to life with a personalized engaging experience can be the antidote to stale, esoteric docs. Build docs that act as the butler to your product.\n   Today, too many documentation sites are static, out-of-date, and lifeless. They aren\u2019t thought of with the same care and detail as the core product, even though they often are a core product. The reader is expected to do too much work, open tab after tab, search endlessly and scroll through verbose articles just to find a simple code example.\n Wouldn\u2019t it be great if the docs knew that you were writing a Python app on a Windows machine and that you preferred watching videos instead of reading through text? I want you to find the answer to your questions in the docs, easily and efficiently. When you\u2019re stuck on a problem and you turn to the docs, there\u2019s a moment of magic as you find the solution, try it out and it works. In that moment you become unblocked, you learn something new and you can move on to keep building your application.\n Over the past year, I\u2019ve spent time with our documentation team at GitHub where we have been working together to understand the challenges that developers face with documentation today. We want to build an experience that works better, inspires more, teaches instead of assumes, confuses less, and is personalized to your needs as a developer. Together, we learned a few key things that have helped misunderstand some of the pain developers face with documentation every day:\n People have a hard time finding what they need: Documentation is not linked from the right places in the product.\n Support teams rely on a knowledge management system (KM) that duplicates the docs instead of referencing them \u2014 focusing on content storage, retrieval, and assessment (instead of end-user success).\n Developers learn different things in lots of different ways \u2014 tutorials, videos, examples, guides, etc. Docs today mostly offer static content with code examples that aren\u2019t interactive.\n People use search as a way to navigate, and they often lose the search UX when they\u2019re deep into an article.\n When developers get stuck, they want to ask other developers questions &amp; get an answer from their peers.\n By the way, if we solve for these pain points, not only are we making the experience of reading and interacting with the docs better, but we\u2019re also able to improve the experience of writing the docs. If you\u2019re lucky to have an amazing group of technical writers, like we do at GitHub, it\u2019s important to take advantage of their deep knowledge of the product and give them the tools to write great docs. We open sourced the entire GitHub Docs application in October of 2020, this includes the content, the code, and even the process for authoring articles. With a system that\u2019s authored in a collaborative, immersive way, we have to build a user experience to match.\n  After talking with hundreds of developers, learning what they were struggling with, and what they wished for, I wrote up a few principles. The intent was to have something to lean on, that I could use as I brainstormed ideas that may solve some frustrations developers have with documentation.\n Lead with code: Developers want to write code, give them the code examples as starting blocks. Don\u2019t bury the lede.\n Solve the problem (aka: answer the question): Developers come to docs to learn the answer to a question, challenge, or problem they\u2019re trying to resolve. Give them the answer through multiple methods (video, text, tutorials, guides, etc.), so they learn the solution in a way that works for them.\n Enable community: Embrace the fun of collaboration, the support of the community, and empower people teaching people.\n Meet user&#39;s needs: Docs should never be optimized to result in a support ticket, we don\u2019t funnel devs to open tickets, we ensure our content meets the user\u2019s need.\n Encourage contribution: Open source \u2014 anyone should be able to contribute to docs &amp; help improve the content.\n Keep docs fresh: Software changes, so should the docs! They should feel alive, fresh, and relevant.\n Refine and simplify: Simplicity is hard to achieve, we consistently refine and simplify our platform and access to content \u2014 minimize the clicks to content.\n Measurable success: We are actively measuring if our content successfully meets users\u2019 needs and consistently improves its efficacy.\n Encourage play and experimentation: Developers come to docs to do many things, let them discover and engage creatively through playing around. \u201cTry it yourself!\u201d\n Medium agnostic &amp; portable: Developers should be able to call docs from wherever they are, like their terminal or their IDE. Code examples should be easy to take with you and re-use.\n  This next part is a little peek into the brain of a product person. What follows are a series of ideas \u2014 some of these are provoking actual improvements to GitHub\u2019s docs, but I use them as a way to spark curiosity and generate ideas for how we can build better docs for developers in general.\n My goal with these sketches was to set a direction for how we can take docs into a more community-driven, developer-first, extensible &amp; interactive, engaging world. The idea is that they\u2019re medium agnostic (devs can call docs from wherever they are), they\u2019re open source (anyone can contribute to the docs easily, which will mean updating our publishing process), and they\u2019re content as software (we treat the content like it\u2019s part of the software development process, not secondary to it).\n I wanted to move from a system that focuses on the brevity of our content platform to one that also highlights the intent behind what the developer is trying to do. When you look at other learning and content systems like Stripe, Twilio, or Circle CI, they structure the content around intent models. \u201cGet started with Stripe\u2019s API\u201d, for example, pinpoints the intent of the content upon entry, which puts the power into the hands of the developer as they explore and learn.\n These sketches are designed to help our users get to the right place faster, and force us as curators to think about what the reader is trying to do \u2014 we can structure based on intent, instead of brevity.\n Finally, they introduce a system that we can expand on as we explore and start building against it. So, there are a few things that I intentionally didn\u2019t focus on, but we\u2019ll need to address at some point because they\u2019re important:\n    I started with the article page for a tutorial or guide. I picked it first because developers often end up looking at these pages before they see any other part of the site and that\u2019s thanks to referral links and Google search.\n The idea behind this page is to get the reader into the content as quickly as possible so that they can experiment and try things themselves. The page is broken down into three parts: the left rail that walks through the tutorial steps, the right interaction box that highlights code examples, and the bottom which tells you where to go next and if you\u2019re feeling generous asks for feedback. The most important part of the page: the interaction.\n     Developers I talk with about documentation always tell me that they primarily learn from each other. Sometimes it\u2019s through code review, other times it\u2019s from googling and reading through other developer\u2019s examples. Taking this feedback to heart, I decided to play around with what it might look like to have a conversation about the software or code from within the documentation itself.\n      Docs are about learning and people learn in many ways. The idea that you learn in only one way has always seemed a little bananas to me. Sometimes I\u2019m an audible learner, sometimes I\u2019m visual. Embracing that, and the desire to make the docs come to life a little bit, I decided to add some video.\n This page works similarly to the article/tutorial page that uses code examples. If you\u2019d rather watch a video about the content, then click the video tab and press play. The video will show you a developer walking through the steps in the content on the left rail \u2014 and as you scroll, the video will advance to that part of the tutorial.\n   And because SSH is a bit of a white whale for documentation (it\u2019s the most visited article page for docs.github.com), I decided to explore a bit more about what would make the SSH article a little more friendly, but these layout options work for any tutorial. Here\u2019s what that looks like:\n    Search and navigation are often one in the same for content sites, but the UX is driven by intent.\n Let\u2019s start with navigation. To make sense of the breadth of content on the GitHub documentation page, we organize things into categories. However, category bloat happens when there are too many choices for a user to think about. This is the \u2018soup aisle conundrum,\u2019 which can of soup do you choose when you have over 100 options? The choice becomes so overwhelming that the customer eventually gives up. To combat category bloat, we curate what we serve to the user (we can lean on the search features to allow readers to navigate with more precision). When we curate aggressively we increase the precision and accuracy of our content. This helps get our users to the right place faster, and forces us as curators to think about what the reader is trying to do \u2014 we can structure these categories based on intent, instead of content brevity.\n Because navigation is a cornerstone for the site, I wrote down some rules for this sketch:\n    Navigation hierarchy works in cooperation with content hierarchy. Products are top-level, categories are curated based on intent, topics organize articles within a category and articles teach concepts in a topic. What you see above is an example of how the navigation fluctuates as you dive into a product area. Since there\u2019s more than one product, we need a view for that, too.\n  As you\u2019re exploring the site, use the navigation (this mega menu) to keep you oriented and find new things. What I\u2019ve learned from watching developers use docs.github.com, and from the usage data, is that people typically stay within one product area \u2014 they don\u2019t often explore across products during the same session. But if you wanted to, we need to make that kind of behavior easy, because the docs navigation is part of the way people discover new GitHub products!\n Now onto search. Search is a way to navigate with more precision (as opposed to browsing). You have an idea for what you\u2019re looking for, and you want to search for the answer. For example, if you\u2019re like me you constantly forget how GitHub SSH works, so whenever you need to use it you search for the SSH article. Search is also a cornerstone to the entire site experience, so it should be front and center.\n    The entire motivation for exploring these sketches is to build a doc experience that meets developers where they\u2019re at. Docs.github.com can do a better job of organizing the content, giving you new ways to access it, and customizing a reading experience that is designed for you. Developer documentation is part of the product, an extension of the application, and a part of the code. Without it, people can get lost, so it\u2019s important to give waypoints and that\u2019s what this system is intended to provide. The more magic \u201caha!\u201d and \u201cit worked!\u201d moments that we can inspire through documentation, the more we\u2019re unlocking a path for people to be creative, productive, and get back to the business of coding.\n If you think that documentation sites don\u2019t need to be prioritized or that we shouldn\u2019t invest in them, just ask a developer what they need, and then go think again about what you might be missing out on if you don\u2019t have an immersive, interactive and engaging experience for docs. Instead of just making Yet Another Docs Site (YADS), let\u2019s make experiences that stands apart \u2014 our developers deserve it.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 04:22:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u60f3\u5230,\u6587\u6863", "title": "\u4e5f\u8bb8\u662f\u65f6\u5019\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\u6587\u4ef6 ", "title_en": "Maybe it\u2019s time we re-think docs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://kathykorevec.medium.com/building-a-better-place-for-docs-197f92765409", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u60f3\u5230", "\u6587\u6863"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8e0538daae4cea7a15c114ed73dc31a3.jpg", "infoid": 1067543, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Cat Contillo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a84\u50b2\u7684\u5947\u8ff9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u548c\u4ea8\u7279\u585e\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u3002\u5979\u5bf9LGBTQ +\u6743\u5229\uff0c\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u5927\u5b66\uff0cDEI\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\u3002\n  \u795e\u7ecf\u5927\u5b66\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c2\u770b\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6982\u5ff5 -

She&#39;s passionate about LGBTQ+ rights, autism, neurodiversity, DEI and cybersecurity.\n  Neurodiversity can mean different things to different people. It\u2019s a concept that views the spectrum of neurological differences \u2014 like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette\u2019s and other cognitive and developmental disorders \u2014 as natural variations of the human brain. In a nutshell, neurodiversity recognizes that brain differences are just that: differences.\n I was always aware of the fact that I had a different operating system. It was like growing up on a Mac OS, but made specifically for Windows OS. It wasn\u2019t until I was diagnosed as autistic that I understood why I am the way that I am. My diagnosis gave me a purpose. It\u2019s a purpose I\u2019ve taken with me into the working world, and it\u2019s helped me realize how vital neurodiverse individuals can and will be to the cybersecurity industry.\n   There are many inherent traits in people with autism that are well suited for working in cybersecurity. For example, many people with autism are pattern thinkers and are highly detail-oriented. This allows someone in a threat-hunting position to find those subtle differences between malicious and nonmalicious code and catch the threats that automated tools might miss. We also have the ability to hyperfocus, which allows us to concentrate on problem-solving and stick with complex issues that other people may abandon.\n Of course, we all have a different set of skills, interests, strengths and weaknesses. But there are some characteristics that \u2014 when given the right support and environment \u2014 can translate to cybersecurity positively.\n This is especially true when autistic adults are interested in technology and cybersecurity. Their interest can complement their attention to detail, which can make for a successful blue team cyber professional. The number and types of cyber threats are constantly changing. Some are obvious to hunt down, and some are much more subtle. Some malware even has the ability to \u201clive off the land\u201d by using already created applications or executables that live natively on a computer. Knowing this information, and knowing what to look for and where to hone in, allows a neurodivergent person to consistently inspect, investigate and hunt down even the most persistent threats.\n  Instead of focusing on what makes a neurodivergent person \u201cdifferent,\u201d we should embrace the benefits that different minds and viewpoints bring to the field of cybersecurity. Let\u2019s face it: The world is going to need more cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring diversity in these teams includes embracing neurodiversity. Having a blend of unique talents provided by these detail-oriented, rule-bound, logical and independent-thinking individuals is \u2014 and will be \u2014 a competitive edge in cybersecurity.\n Having a career in cybersecurity typically requires logic, discipline, curiosity and the ability to solve problems and find patterns. This is an industry that offers a wide spectrum of positions and career paths for people who are neurodivergent, particularly for roles in threat analysis, threat intelligence and threat hunting.\n Neurodiverse minds are usually great at finding the needle in the haystack, the small red flags and minute details that are critical for hunting down and analyzing potential threats. Other strengths include pattern recognition, thinking outside the box, attention to detail, a keen sense of focus, methodical thinking and integrity.\n The more diverse your teams are, the more productive, creative and successful they will be. And not only can neurodiverse talent help strengthen cybersecurity, employing different minds and perspectives can also solve communication problems and create a positive impact for both your team and your company.\n According to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for Information Security Analysts \u2014 one of the common career paths for cybersecurity professionals \u2014 is expected to grow 31% by 2029, much higher than the average growth rate of 4% for other occupations. While vital jobs in cybersecurity are going unfilled, millions of smart people who\u2019d be ideally suited for the work remain unemployed.\n  It\u2019s time to challenge the assumption that qualified talent equals neurotypicality. There are many steps companies can take to ensure inclusivity and promote belonging in the workplace. Let\u2019s start all the way at the beginning and focus on job postings.\n Job postings should be black and white in terms of the information they are asking for and the job requirements. Start by making job postings more inclusive and less constrictive in what is being required. Include a contact email address where an applicant can ask for accommodations, and provide a less traditional approach by providing these accommodations.\n Traditional interviews can be a challenge for neurodivergent individuals, and this is often the first hurdle to employment. For example, to ease some candidates\u2019 nerves, you could provide a list of questions that will be asked as a guideline. More importantly, don\u2019t judge someone based on their lack of eye contact.\n To promote an inclusive and belonging culture of neurodiversity in the workplace, the workplace should be more supportive of different needs. It is vital to ensure employees at all levels have the knowledge and understanding on how to empower a diverse team and create an open and inclusive workplace. This starts with diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging training for all employees. Companies should also consider changing their communication style. Neurodiverse individuals communicate differently and not altering the way you communicate could lead to a disconnect in the workplace.\n My advice to other neurodivergent and/or autistic adults looking to break into the cybersecurity field is to continue your learning, connect with cybersecurity professionals for networking purposes and never give up.

What are you going to actually do to prevent those crashes, to save those lives?\u201d Mark Rosekind, the company\u2019s chief safety innovation officer and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.\n   Zoox is a bit different from its rivals. It isn\u2019t just developing the self-driving software stack. The company is responsible for creating the on-demand ride-sharing app and the vehicle itself. Zoox also plans to own, manage and operate its robotaxi fleet.\n Zoox unveiled in December the  electric, autonomous robotaxi it built from the ground up \u2014 a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. At the time, Zoox shared a few specs on the four-seat vehicle, including the face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter, and the 133 kilowatt-hour battery that the company said allows it to operate for up to 16 continuous hours on a single charge. But not everything was revealed, particularly details about how it would protect occupants in the vehicle as well as the pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers it will be sharing the road with.\n To be clear, Zoox is not the only AV company issuing safety reports. Voluntary safety self-assessment reports, or VSSAs, have become fairly common in the industry. These voluntary safety reports, which are included in  NHTSA\u2019s Automated Driving Systems VSSA Disclosure Index, are supposed to cover 12 areas, including the vehicle\u2019s design, crash simulation scenarios, benchmarks for testing as well as protective measures for occupants and other road users.\n Zoox\u2019s  first safety report came out in 2018, which outlined the company\u2019s \u201cprevent and protect\u201d philosophy. This latest one reveals how Zoox plans to meet its safety goals, including specific details on the design of the vehicle. And more safety reports are coming \u2014 per a few hints in this latest one \u2014 including details about its collision avoidance system and the lighting system the vehicle uses for communicating with other road users.\n Zoox has designed and built more than 100 safety innovations into its purposeful vehicle. Rosekind shared details on nine of them that fall into three categories: driving control, no single point of failure and rider protection.\n   Zoox\u2019s purpose-built vehicle has independent braking and inactive suspension system, which means that each of the brakes has its own electronic control unit, allowing for more control over traction on the road, weight distribution and an active suspension. All of that translates to shorter stopping distances.\n The vehicle also has four-wheel steering, which Rosekind noted doesn\u2019t exist on any car on the road today, and is bidirectional. Four wheel steering allows the vehicle to simultaneously adjust where it is headed and its position within the lane.\n \u201cOnce our software has determined the path for the vehicle, it\u2019ll stay on that path down to centimeters accuracy \u2014 even at speed through a curb, Rosekind explained.\n The four-wheel steering combined with the vehicle\u2019s  symmetrical design allows for it to travel bidirectionally. The bidirectional capability means no more U-turns or three-point turns, two maneuvers  that are more complex, time consuming and can make occupants more vulnerable to oncoming traffic.\n Rosekind said the company\u2019s design objective was that there would be no single point of failure for its safety critical systems. For instance, the vehicle has two powertrains. The motors, drive systems and batteries work in conjunction with each other. If one component in the system fails, the other one will take over.\n The vehicle also has two batteries as well as a safety diagnostics system that monitors all of the hardware, software and firmware. Sensors like lidar and. radar are also placed on the four corners of the vehicle, each one which provides a 270-degree field of view.\n The diagnostic system goes beyond monitoring and will  mitigate a failure or performance problem that it identifies. For instance, if a sensor has degraded performance from damage or debris, it will activate a cleaning system on the vehicle or turn it from\u00a0 bidirectional to unidirectional, so the sensor in a position where basically doesn\u2019t matter if it is obscured, Rosekind explained.\n \u201cFailsafe operational means it\u2019s going to continue the ride, let you out, and then go take care of whatever the issue is, or pull over to a safe spot,\u201d he said.\n   Zoox\u2019s goal is for its vehicle to meet a five-star crash protection for every seat in the vehicle. The vehicles are currently going through crash testing now, Rosekind said, adding that it is \u201cgoing quite well and almost complete.\u201d\n The company also designed a new kind of airbag system that contains five different airbags. Curtain airbags are on each side of the vehicle, a frontal one is divided in two parts to protect the head, neck and chest. There are also rear and side seat airbags.\n Within the system is an\u00a0airbag control unit that can monitor where a collision is coming as well as the velocity and determine which airbags and in what order to deploy. Instead of every airbag deploying at once, they will inflate based on the collision location and the severity of the impact.\n Finally, the vehicle has sensors in the seat, the buckle and even the coating on the webbing of the seatbelt to be able to tell if passengers are using the seatbelt. The vehicle will not start until everybody\u2019s buckled up, Rosekind said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 03:45:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bbe\u8ba1,amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,zoox,owned", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u62e5\u6709\u7684Zoox\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow Amazon-owned Zoox designed its self-driving vehicles to prevent crashes and protect if they do\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/how-amazon-owned-zoox-designed-its-self-driving-vehicles-to-prevent-crashes-and-protect-if-they-do/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bbe\u8ba1", "amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "zoox", "owned"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3a4f1314a5220a4b4a8dd0b4ce68ee2b.jpg", "infoid": 1067541, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Twitter\u6b63\u5728\u6253\u5f00\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5bf9\u5176\u8d85\u7ea7\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Twitter\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f;\u8d85\u7ea7\u9075\u5faa\u9650\u5236\u4e3aiOS\uff0c\u800ciOS\u548cAndroid\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\n Twitter\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5c0f\u7ec4\u201d\u7528\u6237\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u65b0\u7684\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5ba3\u5e03\u3002 Super\u4ee5\u4e0b\u529f\u80fd\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u6536\u53d62.99\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c4.99\u7f8e\u5143\u6216\u6bcf\u67089.99\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95ee\u72ec\u5bb6\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u552e\u7968\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6536\u53d61\u7f8e\u5143\u81f3999\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95eeTwitter\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u97f3\u9891\u5ba4\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u8bbe\u7f6e\u623f\u95f4\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u76d6\u5b50\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fa7\u680f\u4e2d\u67e5\u770b\u65b0\u7684\u201cMometization\u201d\u9009\u9879\u6765\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n   \u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u56e2\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6700\u521d\u5c06\u4fdd\u755997\uff05\u7684\u94b1\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7528\u7968\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u8d85\u7ea7\u6362\u53d6\uff0c\u5728IOS\u548cAndroid\u6536\u53d6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u5185\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u8d39\u7528\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u603b\u517150,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5219Twitter\u5c06\u4ece3\uff05\u589e\u52a0\u523020\uff05\u3002\n \u65e9\u671f\uff0c\u81ea\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u9884\u89c8\u4e86\u552e\u7968\u5e2d\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u6177\u6168\u7684\u6536\u5165\u62c6\u5206\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ecf\u7406Esther Crawford\u63a8\u65ad\u4e86\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u786e\u4fdd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u80fd\u591f\u8d5a\u94b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 ...\u4ece\u8d85\u7ea7\u8d5b\u540e\u83b7\u5f97$ 50k +\u7968\u636e\u548c\u552e\u7968\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u793a\u60a8\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u6210\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u201c\n  Twitter\u768420\uff05\u7684\u4f63\u91d1\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u8ba2\u9605\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u670d\u52a1\u62bd\u6410\u4ece\u8ba2\u9605\u4e2d\u524a\u51cf\u4e8650\uff05\uff0c\u800cYouTube\u5219\u6536\u53d630\uff05\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u8d39\u3002\u8d39\u7528\u4e5f\u4e0e\u552f\u4e00\u768420\uff05\u76f8\u79f0\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5927\u5e45\u9ad8\u4e8e10\uff05\u7684\u901a\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6216\u8005\u4f1a\u5458\u5e73\u53f0Patreon\u76845\uff05\u57fa\u672c\u7387\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u670d\u52a1\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u5904\u7406\u8d39\u3002\u867d\u7136Facebook\u57282018\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u8ba2\u9605\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u91c7\u53d6\u4efb\u4f55\u4f63\u91d1\uff08\u9664\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u5916\uff09\u76f4\u52302023\u5e74\u3002 ", "note_en": "Twitter is opening applications for a limited test of its Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces features. US-based users can apply separately for each program through Twitter\u2019s mobile app; Super Follows are restricted to iOS, while Ticketed Spaces are available on iOS and Android.\n Twitter will select a \u201csmall group\u201d of users to test its new monetization features, both of which were announced earlier this year. The  Super Follows feature lets users charge $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month for access to exclusive content.  Ticketed Spaces lets them charge between $1 and $999 for access to one of  Twitter\u2019s social audio rooms, and it offers extra features like setting a room size cap. Users can see if they\u2019re eligible to apply by checking a new \u201cMonetization\u201d option in the mobile app sidebar.\n   Test group participants will initially keep 97 percent of the money they make with Ticketed Spaces or Super Follows, after the fee that iOS and Android charge for in-app purchases. Twitter will increase its cut from 3 percent to 20 percent if a user makes a total of $50,000 on both systems.\n That early, far more generous revenue split has been added  since a preview of Ticketed Spaces last month. Today, senior product manager Esther Crawford tweeted that \u201cwe want to ensure that emerging voices are able to earn money, which is why they\u2019ll be eligible to earn a larger share starting out. ...

But it\u2019s substantially higher than the 10 percent commission from newsletter platform Substack or the 5 percent base rate of membership platform Patreon, although both those services require additional payment processing fees.

Following that topic, I&#39;d like to put down some thoughts about how browsers decode images - and how they do it differently, which can make things a bit tricky for you if you want to deliver the same user experience for every user of your application.\n So what does this mean exactly? Well, let&#39;s say that you have a single  img tag on your web page, but you update the  src attribute of it via JavaScript, and you do this often enough to trigger  this bug in Firefox. You can easily trigger it if you hook a scroll event to switching the  src attribute so that on each scroll the image source updates, which should work just fine on Chrome, but on Firefox will start blinking.\n Why does it start blinking? Well, it has everything to do with image decoding. The reason that it blinks on Firefox is that the image hasn&#39;t yet decoded when your scroll event is being triggered, but you are already attempting to display it - hence the blink.  There&#39;s a pretty easy solution for this that I also wrote about on the bug report but the gist of the matter is that the   HTMLImageElement  has a Promise called   decode and that you should not replace the  src attribute until the decode finishes, which you can do like this:\n const imgUrl = &#39;yournewimage.png&#39;; // your new imageconst img = new Image(); // create temporary imageimg.src = imgUrl; // add your new image as src on the temporary imageimg.decode().then(() =&gt; { // wait until temporary image is decoded document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl; // replace your actual element now});\n You see because in Firefox once the decode happens, even if it happens on an image element other than the one you are updating, the decoded result of that image is cached, and with it, the bug resolved.\n  Technically yes,  the MDN recommends that to know when it is safe to add the image to DOM, but what happens in Chrome with this code? Well, turns out it slows to a crawl and you&#39;re better off not using it. Now I don&#39;t think Chrome has implemented this feature in any other way from Firefox, except that for some unbeknownst reason it is a lot slower, but I do think that the two browsers decode images in a different way.\n While in Firefox you will see an artifact in the form of a blink when the decode is taking place, I think in Chrome you&#39;ll just not see an updated image until that image has decoded, thus you don&#39;t see a blink and everything  feels smoother, even if it is probably just the same. I tried to find more information on the differences but was unsuccessful, so if you do know something please get in touch. For now, without knowing more, my best recommendation is to in such a case simply write one implementation targeting Firefox and the other Chrome, like this:\n const firefox = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf(&#39;firefox&#39;) &gt; -1;const imgUrl = &#39;yournewimage.png&#39;;const img = new Image();img.src = imgUrl;if (firefox) { img.decode().then(() =&gt; { document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl; });} else { document.querySelector(&#39;img&#39;).src = imgUrl;}\n In Firefox we wait for the  decode Promise to tell us when we can safely update the image  src attribute, according to MDN spec. Otherwise, we&#39;ll just update the  src regardless of waiting for the decode to happen or not.\n And that&#39;s how I unified the experience across Firefox and Chrome with this particular issue. It&#39;s actually funny because just recently I remember thinking that browsers had come such a long way in the past 10 years that if you write something in one it always works in the others.

I ran them all with  docker-compose from a  Debian VPS.\n For the last couple months, however, I\u2019ve been meaning to move awayfrom Debian and towards something more minimal and clean. Over thislast weekend, I decided to move to  Alpine Linux.\n     In a previous move between two servers, I simply  rsynced therelevant files over to the new VPS. Here, where I\u2019m just switchingoperating systems on a single server, I figured I could make a backupwith Tarsnap, and be done within the day.\n However, backups are much more complex than simply transferring filesfrom one server to another. My haphazard strategy resulted in threedays of stress and frustration as I clambered to restore aself-hosting empire that I myself had reduced to ash.\n  I began my work on the transition full of optimism, if a bit stressed.I had read through the Tarsnap online documentation a number of times,and was ready to make my first attempt. I loaded my Tarsnap account upwith USD$10 and ran:\n  My terminal sat empty for hours. There were no changes \u2013 the processwas running, but there was no feedback. I was nervous.\n   To my horror, stats printed to the screen: the backup had been 90%complete, and I had stopped it. Convinced I had ruined the backupcompletely, I deleted the partial backup from Tarsnap and startedagain from scratch.\n This was my first, but not last, moment close to tears. I went tosleep and let the backup run overnight.\n  Day Two began well: I woke and the backup was finished! I wiped theVPS, installed Alpine, and brought it up to spec. I created a regularuser, configured SSH, and decided to use  doas instead of  sudo fora change. Alpine, so far, feels great to use. None of the cruft thatbothered me when using Debian.\n     I opened up a new  tmux window and poked around the filesystem. Allmy files seemed like they were already there\u2026\n    It errored out. All my environment variables were undefined. Then ithit me: I forgot to back up the  .env file. My eyes welled up.\n Still, I was determined. I worked to reconstruct the  .env file fromsecrets I had stored in  Bitwarden (my offline copy, because my vaultis self-hosted and was thus down).\n   One of my services was missing a Dockerfile to build. I shouldn\u2019t havepressed  &lt;Ctrl-C&gt;! I was a total moron.\n  I gathered what was left of my resolve and trudged onwards. I searched tarsnap\u2019s manpages looking for something to speed up my download.\n I found a number of flags that could have helped me  make a backupbetter the next time around, but nothing that would help me restorethe backup any faster. With nothing in the manpages, I went to look atthe  helper scripts.\n  That\u2019s when I found it:  redsnapper. A Ruby script that runs multipletarsnap clients at once to extract archives  fast. Fuckingprecisely. I wiped out the incomplete files I had restored, downloadedRuby and started restoring from the backup once again:\n  I changed  the song, and watched the files fly by on my screen. Iwent to sleep, confident I would wake to good news.\n    I restarted  redsnapper, explicitly excluding the  .mkv it hadfailed to download, and let it run until it came on another movie andcrashed again (an hour or so later). I excluded the second movie fileand sent it to run again.\n   Then I realized something.  redsnapper kept crashing when it hitmovies I had stored in  Jellyfin.\n I don\u2019t need Jellyfin at all. I\u2019ve never watched a movie more thanonce.\n The movies take up massive storage on disk, and keep causing tarsnapto crash. They don\u2019t compress well either, so they take up a fucktonof space in the archives.\n I stopped the download in the middle - the day\u2019s third, after twoearlier attempts that ended after encountering movie files \u2013 andchanged the command slightly before rerunning. After a number oferrors I couldn\u2019t explain, I realized my account was negative andtopped it up with another USD$25 before running:\n  I returned to my computer a couple hours later.  redsnapper hadstopped, with a whole lot of files extracted and a couple errors atthe bottom about symlinks.\n I figured, this time, it had probably done everything properly butcouldn\u2019t create the symlinks (probably a flag missing somewhere). Imanually went through my files creating the symlinks, and then broughteverything up with docker-compose.\n      After shutting down my containers, I backed up my entire setup.This included a number of  \u201clive\u201d databases,  .git folders,and other data that I either did not need or could reconstructonce the move had been completed.\n I didn\u2019t back up the  .env file I use to store secrets for use in docker-compose.yml. I was luckily able to reconstruct it fromindividual secrets I stored in my password manager.\n A thorough read of the manpages before I started (rather than justthe online guides) would have revealed several helpful flags: -v to see what files  tarsnap is operating on, --aggressive-networking to take advantage of the datacenterinternet speeds, and  --recover to resume interrupted backups, toname a few.\n We already talked about Jellyfin. Even with very little content inJellyfin, the collection took up huge amounts of space on disk andin the backup (especially because video files don\u2019t compresswell), and sat entirely unused. It is now gone. Good riddance.\n  What did I learn? Well, I\u2019m still devising a plan to prevent thingslike this from happening in the future. Here\u2019s the plan currently:\n  Back up everything every day. I\u2019ll build a buffer of three \u201crolling\u201dbackups, where backups collect up to a max of three and then, as newbackups are created, the older backups are removed.\n The backup script will shut down the services, dump the databases(i.e. convert as much content to plain-text, easily-compressibleformats as possible) and make a time-stamped backup (currently onlywith Tarsnap, but perhaps in the future with a number of otherservices).\n  Simply having high-quality backups to restore will already be a hugeleap forward. I\u2019m also  definitely going to continue using redsnapper: the speed gains it gives on large backups are crucial.\n    I\u2019ll write further about my self-hosting setup as it evolves, andpublish the backup script once its finished. I\u2019ll also maintain adedicated page on my site describing my self-hosting setup as itchanges.\n Also, I\u2019m sure there are people more knowledgeable about Tarsnap thanI. That\u2019s basically the point of this article.
