It started at a Burger-G restaurant in Cary, NC on May 17. It seemed like such a simple thing at the time, but May 17 marked a pivotal moment in human history.</p><p>取决于您想要考虑的方式，它是有趣或不可避免的或象征的，机器人收购没有启动麻省理工学院，美国宇航局，微软或福特。它于5月17日在Cary的一家汉堡-G餐厅始于一家汉堡餐厅。当时似乎是如此简单的事情，但5月17日在人类历史中标志着一个关键时刻。</p><p> Burger-G was a fast food chain that had come out of nowhere starting with its first restaurant in Cary. The Burger-G chain had an attitude and a style that said “hip” and “fun” to a wide swath of the American middle class. The chain was able to grow with surprising speed based on its popularity and the public persona of the young founder, Joe Garcia. Over time, Burger-G grew to 1,000 outlets in the U.S. and showed no signs of slowing down. If the trend continued, Burger-G would soon be one of the “Top 5” fast food restaurants in the U.S.</p><p> Burger-G是一个快速的食物链，无论如何都是从Cary的第一家餐馆开始。汉堡队链有一种态度和一种态度，称“嘻嘻”和“乐趣”到美国中产阶级的宽带。基于其joe garcia的年轻创始人的普及和公共角色，链条能够随着令人惊讶的速度而增长。随着时间的推移，Burger-g在美国的1,000个网点上升到了1,000个网点，并没有显示出放慢速度的迹象。如果趋势持续，汉堡G将很快成为美国的“五大”快餐店之一</p><p> The “robot” installed at this first Burger-G restaurant looked nothing like the robots of popular culture. It was not hominid like C-3PO or futuristic like R2-D2 or industrial like an assembly line robot. Instead it was simply a PC sitting in the back corner of the restaurant running a piece of software. The software was called “Manna”, version 1.0 *.</p><p> 在这个第一个Burger-G餐厅安装的“机器人”看起来只看起来像流行文化的机器人。它不是像C-3PO或FUTICING这样的像R2-D2或工业，如装配线机器人一样。相反，它只是一个坐在餐厅的后角落运行一块软件的电脑。该软件被称为“Manna”，版本1.0 *。</p><p> Manna’s job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting way. Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at the store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and out on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to taking the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day. This was a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-first century, there were millions of businesses that operated in this way.</p><p> Manna的工作是管理商店，并以最有趣的方式做到这一点。想想一个正常的快餐店。一群员工在商店工作，通常在一家普通餐厅的50人，他们每周进出旋转。人们做了一切让汉堡接受订单来清洁桌子并取出垃圾。所有这些员工都向商店经理和几位助理经理报告。经理聘请了员工，安排了他们并告诉他们每天要做什么。这是一个完全正常的安排。在二十一世纪初，有数百万的企业以这种方式运营。</p><p> But the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The problem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run perfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms, great customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were chaotic and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a customer off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores were the Achilles heel of any chain.</p><p> 但快餐产业有一个问题，汉堡G没有什么不同。问题是快餐体验的质量。有些餐馆完美奔跑。他们有礼貌和周到的船员，清洁洗手间，伟大的客户服务和订单的高准确性。其他餐厅对客户进行混乱而不舒服。由于一个糟糕的经历可以让顾客送到整个餐馆链，这些良好的商店是任何链的阿基尔脚跟。</p><p> To solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and commissioned a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the managers and tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna version 1.0 was born.</p><p> 要解决问题，Burger-G与软件顾问签约并委托了一块软件。该软件的目标是取代管理者，并告诉员工以更可控的方式做些什么。 Manna版本1.0出生。</p><p> Manna was connected to the cash registers, so it knew how many people were flowing through the restaurant. The software could therefore predict with uncanny accuracy when the trash cans would fill up, the toilets would get dirty and the tables needed wiping down. The software was also attached to the time clock, so it knew who was working in the restaurant. Manna also had “help buttons” throughout the restaurant. Small signs on the buttons told customers to push them if they needed help or saw a problem. There was a button in the restroom that a customer could press if the restroom had a problem. There was a button on each trashcan. There was a button near each cash register, one in the kiddie area and so on. These buttons let customers give Manna a heads up when something went wrong.</p><p> Manna已连接到收银机，所以它知道有多少人流过餐厅。因此，当垃圾桶填满时，该软件可以预测不可思议的准确性，厕所会变脏，并且需要擦拭的表格。该软件还附加到时钟，所以它知道谁在餐厅工作。 Manna在整个餐厅中也有“帮助按钮”。按钮上的小迹象告诉客户如果他们需要帮助或出现问题，请推动它们。洗手间里有一个按钮，如果洗手间出现问题，客户可以按下。每个垃圾桶都有一个按钮。每个收银机附近有一个按钮，一个在kiddie地区等。这些按钮让客户在出现问题时给予Manna A. </p><p> At any given moment Manna had a list of things that it needed to do. There were orders coming in from the cash registers, so Manna directed employees to prepare those meals. There were also toilets to be scrubbed on a regular basis, floors to mop, tables to wipe, sidewalks to sweep, buns to defrost, inventory to rotate, windows to wash and so on. Manna kept track of the hundreds of tasks that needed to get done, and assigned each task to an employee one at a time.</p><p>在任何特定的时刻，Manna有一个需要做的事情清单。有订单来自现金寄存器，所以Manna执导员工准备那些餐点。还有厕所要定期擦洗，楼层拖把，桌子擦拭，人行道扫，面包放置，库存旋转，窗户旋转，窗户洗净等。 Manna追踪了完成所需的数百个任务，并一次为员工分配给员工。</p><p> Manna told employees what to do simply by talking to them. Employees each put on a headset when they punched in. Manna had a voice synthesizer, and with its synthesized voice Manna told everyone exactly what to do through their headsets. Constantly. Manna micro-managed minimum wage employees to create perfect performance.</p><p> Manna告诉员工只是通过与他们交谈来做什么。当他们打入时，员工每个人都在耳机上放在耳机上。Manna有一个语音合成器，并且它的合成语音阵战告诉大家通过他们的耳机做些什么。不断地。 Manna Micro-Managed最低工资员工创造完美的性能。</p><p> Prefer the Kindle? “Manna” is now available on the Kindle –  Click here!</p><p> 喜欢Kindle？ “Manna”现在可以在Kindle上找到 - 点击这里！</p><p> The software would speak to the employees individually and tell each one exactly what to do. For example, “Bob, we need to load more patties. Please walk toward the freezer.”</p><p> 该软件将单独与员工与员工交谈，并告诉每个人才究竟该怎么办。例如，“鲍勃，我们需要加载更多的馅饼。请走向冰箱。“</p><p> Or, “Jane, when you are through with this customer, please close your register. Then we will clean the women’s restroom.”</p><p> 或者，“Jane，当您通过此客户时，请关闭您的注册。然后我们将清洁女性的洗手间。“</p><p> And so on. The employees were told exactly what to do, and they did it quite happily. It was a major relief actually, because the software told them precisely what to do step by step.</p><p> 等等。员工究竟被告知该怎么做，他们非常愉快地做到了。它实际上是一个重大的救济，因为软件逐步告诉他们逐步做什么。</p><p> For example, when Jane entered the restroom, Manna used a simple position tracking system built into her headset to know that she had arrived. Manna then told her the first step.</p><p> 例如，当Jane进入洗手间时，Manna使用了一个简单的位置跟踪系统，内置于她的耳机中，以知道她已经到了。南纳然后告诉她第一步。 </p><p> Manna: “Place the ‘wet floor’ warning cone outside the door please.”</p><p>Manna：“将”湿地板“的警告锥放在门外。”</p><p> When Jane completed the task, she would speak the word “OK” into her headset and Manna moved to the next step in the restroom cleaning procedure.</p><p> 当Jane完成任务时，她会将“OK”一词讲成她的耳机，并且Manna移动到厕所清洁程序中的下一步。</p><p>      Once the restroom was clean, Manna would direct Jane to put everything away. Manna would make sure that she carefully washed her hands. Then Manna would immediately start Jane working on a new task. Meanwhile, Manna might send Lisa to the restroom to inspect it and make sure that Jane had done a thorough job. Manna would ask Lisa to check the toilets, the floor, the sink and the mirrors. If Jane missed anything, Lisa would report it.</p><p>      一旦洗手间干净，Manna会将简勇敢地放弃。 Manna会确保她仔细地洗了双手。然后Manna会立即开始致力于一项新任务。与此同时，Manna可能会将丽莎送到洗手间检查它，并确保简曾做过彻底的工作。 Manna会要求Lisa检查厕所，地板，水槽和镜子。如果简错了，丽莎会报告它。</p><p> I grew up in Cary, NC. That was a long time ago, but when I was a kid I lived right in the middle of Cary with my parents. My father was a pilot for a big airline. My mother was a stay-at-home mom and I had a younger sister. We lived in a typical four bedroom suburban home in a nice neighborhood with a swimming pool in the backyard. I was a 15 year-old teenager working at the Burger-G on May 17 when the first Manna system came online.</p><p> 我在Cary，NC成长。那是很久以前的，但是当我还是个孩子的时候，我住在Cary的父母中间。我的父亲是一家大型航空公司的飞行员。我的母亲是一个留在家里的妈妈，我有一个妹妹。我们在一个典型的四卧室郊区家郊区，在一个漂亮的街区，在后院设有一个游泳池。我是一名15岁的少年于5月17日在汉堡队工作，当时第一个Manna系统在线来了。</p><p> I can remember putting on the headset for the first time and the computer talking to me and telling me what to do. It was creepy at first, but that feeling really only lasted a day or so. Then you were used to it, and the job really did get easier. Manna never pushed you around, never yelled at you. The girls liked it because Manna didn’t hit on them either. Manna simply asked you to do something, you did it, you said, “OK”, and Manna asked you to do the next step. Each step was easy. You could go through the whole day on autopilot, and Manna made sure that you were constantly doing something. At the end of the shift Manna always said the same thing. “You are done for today. Thank you for your help.” Then you took off your headset and put it back on the rack to recharge. The first few minutes off the headset were always disorienting — there had been this voice in your head telling you exactly what to do in minute detail for six or eight hours. You had to turn your brain back on to get out of the restaurant.</p><p> 我可以记住第一次和电脑戴上耳机，并告诉我该怎么做。起初是令人毛骨悚然的，但这种感觉真的只持续了一天左右。然后你被习惯了，这项工作确实变得更容易。 Manna从未推动过你，从来没有对你大吼大叫。女孩喜欢它，因为Manna也没有击中它们。 Manna只是要求你做点什么，你做到了，你说，“好的”，曼娜要求你做下一步。每一步都很简单。你可以在自动驾驶仪上度过一整天，曼纳确保你不断做点什么。在班次的末尾，Manna总是说同样的事情。 “你今天完成了。感谢您的帮助。”然后你拿走了你的耳机，把它放回机架上充电。耳机的前几分钟总是迷失方向 - 在你的脑海里一直在告诉你在六到八个小时的分钟细节做什么。你不得不把你的大脑翻回来走出餐厅。</p><p> To me, Manna was OK. The job at Burger-G was mindless, and Manna made it easy by telling you exactly what to do. You could even get Manna to play music through your headphones, in the background. Manna had a set of “stations” that you could choose from. That was a bonus. And Manna kept you busy the entire day. Every single minute, you had something that Manna was telling you to do. If you simply turned off your brain and went with the flow of Manna, the day went by very fast.</p><p> 对我来说，Manna没关系。汉堡 -  G的工作是无意识的，并且曼纳通过告诉你到底做了很简单。在背景中，您甚至可以通过耳机播放音乐。 Manna有一套你可以选择的“站”。这是一个奖金。曼娜让你忙着整天。每一分钟，你有一些曼纳告诉你要做的事情。如果你只是关掉你的大脑并随着阵战的流动，那一天的时间非常迅速。</p><p> My father, on the other hand, did not like Manna at all from the very first day he saw me wearing the headset in the restaurant. He and Mom had come in for lunch and to say hi. I knew they were coming, so I had timed my break so I could sit down with them for a few minutes. When I sat down, my father noticed the headset.</p><p> 另一方面，我的父亲从第一天起不喜欢Manna，他看到我穿着餐厅的耳机。他和妈妈吃过午饭，然后打个招呼。我知道他们来了，所以我休息了，所以我可以坐下来几分钟。当我坐下时，我父亲注意到了耳机。 </p><p> “So”, he said, “they have you working the drive-thru I see. Is that a step up or a step down?”</p><p>“所以”，他说，“他们让你在驾驶 - 我看到。这是一个上台还是下台？“</p><p> “It’s not the drive-thru,” I replied, “it’s a new system they’ve installed called Manna. It manages the store.”</p><p> “这不是驱动器，”我回答说：“这是一个他们安装了名为Manna的新系统。它管理商店。“</p><p>     He looked at me for a long time, “A computer is telling you what to do on the job? What does the manager do?”</p><p>     他长时间看着我，“一台电脑告诉你该工作怎么办？经理人做了什么？“</p><p>  “You mean that a computer is telling you what to do all day?”, he asked.</p><p>  “你的意思是，一台电脑告诉你整天要做什么吗？”他问道。</p><p>   I gave him an example, “Before you got here, I was taking out the trash. Manna told me how to do it.”</p><p>   我给了他一个例子，“在你来这里之前，我正在拿出垃圾。 Manna告诉我如何做到这一点。“</p><p>  “It tells you exactly what to do. Like, It told me to get four new bags from the rack. When I did that it told me to go to trash can #1. Once I got there it told me to open the cabinet and pull out the trash can. Once I did that it told me to check the floor for any debris. Then it told me to tie up the bag and put it to the side, on the left. Then it told me to put a new bag in the can. Then it told me to attach the bag to the rim. Then it told me to put the can back in and close the cabinet. Then it told me to wipe down the cabinet and make sure it’s spotless. Then it told me to push the help button on the can to make sure it is working. Then it told me to move to trash can #2. Like that.”</p><p>  “它告诉你该怎么办。喜欢，它告诉我从机架上获得四个新袋。当我这样做时，它告诉我去垃圾桶＃1。一旦我到了那里，它告诉我打开机柜并拔出垃圾桶。一旦我这样做，它告诉我检查任何碎片的地板。然后它告诉我捆绑包，把它放在左边。然后它告诉我把一个新的包放在罐子里。然后它告诉我将袋子附加到边缘。然后它告诉我要把罐头放回柜子里。然后它告诉我擦下机柜，确保它一尘不染。然后它告诉我要推动罐头的帮助按钮，以确保它正在工作。然后它告诉我搬到垃圾桶＃2。像那样。”</p><p> He looked at me for a long time again before he said, “Good Lord, you are nothing but a piece of a robot. What is it saying to you now?”</p><p> 他在他说：“好主，你只不过是一块机器人之前，他再次看着我了很长一段时间。它现在对你说的是什么？“ </p><p> “It just told me I have three minutes left on my break. And it told me to smile and say hello to the guests. How’s this? Hi!” And I gave him a big toothy grin.</p><p>“它只是告诉我，我休息了三分钟。它告诉我微笑着向客人欢呼。这个怎么样？你好！”我给了他一个大牙齿的笑容。</p><p> “Yesterday the people controlled the computers. Now the computers control the people. You are the eyes and hands for this robot. And all so that Joe Garcia can make $20 million per year. Do you know what will happen if this spreads?”</p><p> “昨天人们控制了电脑。现在电脑控制人民。你是这个机器人的眼睛和手。所有这样乔库西亚每年都可以赚取2000万美元。如果这一展点，你知道会发生什么吗？“</p><p> “No, I don’t. And I think Mr. G makes more than $20 million a year. But right now I’ve got two minutes left, and Manna is telling me that I need to move back to station 3 to get ready for the next run. See ya.” I waved at Mom. Dad just stared at me.</p><p> “不，我没有。我认为G先生每年赚2000万多000万美元。但是现在我已经离开了两分钟，曼娜告诉我，我需要搬回站3站准备下一个运行。拜拜。”我挥手了。爸爸只是盯着我。</p><p> The tests in our Burger-G store were surprisingly successful. There were Burger-G corporate guys in the restaurant watching us, fixing bugs in the software, making sure Manna was covering all the bases, and they were pleased. It took about 3 months to work all the kinks out, and as they did the Manna software totally changed the restaurant. Worker performance nearly doubled. So did customer satisfaction. So did the consistency of the customer’s experience. Trash cans never overfilled. Bathrooms were remarkably clean. Employees always washed their hands when they needed to. Food was ready faster. The meals we handed out were nearly 100 percent accurate because Manna made us check to make sure every item in the bag was exactly what the customer ordered. The store never ran out of supplies — there were always plenty of napkins in the dispenser and the ketchup container was always full. There were enough employees in the store for the busy times, because Manna could accurately track trends and staff appropriately.</p><p> 我们的Burger-G商店的测试令人惊讶地成功。在餐厅里有汉堡公司伙计们，看着我们，修复了软件中的错误，确保Manna覆盖了所有的基地，他们很高兴。大约需要3个月才能工作所有的扭结，因为他们是曼纳软件完全改变了餐馆。工人表现几乎翻了一番。顾客满意度也是如此。所以客户经验的一致性。垃圾罐永远不会过量。浴室非常清洁。员工在需要时总是洗手。食物准备好了。我们发放的饭菜近100％准确，因为Manna让我们检查以确保包中的每个项目都是客户订购的内容。商店从未耗尽过物品 - 分配器中总有很多餐巾，番茄酱容器总是满。在忙碌时期，商店里有足够的员工，因为Manna可以适当地追踪趋势和员工。</p><p> In addition, Burger-G saved a ton of money. Burger-G had hundreds of stores in the United States. Manna worked so well that Burger-G deployed it nationwide. Soon Burger-G had cut more than 3,000 of its higher-paid store employees — mostly assistant managers and managers. That one change saved the company nearly $100 million per year, and all that money came straight to the bottom line for the restaurant chain. Shareholders were ecstatic. Mr. G gave himself another big raise to celebrate. In addition, Manna had optimized store staffing and had gotten a significant productivity boost out of the employees in the store. That saved another $150 million. $250 million made a huge difference in the fast food industry.</p><p> 此外，Burger-G救了一大吨钱。 Burger-G有数百家商店在美国。 Manna工作得很好，那汉堡队在全国范围内部署了它。很快汉堡队削减了超过3,000名高级店员工 - 主要是助理经理和经理。这一变化节省了每年近1亿美元的公司，所有这笔钱都直接到了餐馆链的底线。股东是欣喜若狂的。克先生给自己另一个庆祝了庆祝。此外，Manna还优化了商店人员配置，并在商店的员工中获得了显着的生产力。节省了1.5亿美元。 2.5亿美元的快餐行业取得了巨大差异。</p><p> Prefer the Kindle? “Manna” is now available on the Kindle –  Click here!</p><p> 喜欢Kindle？ “Manna”现在可以在Kindle上找到 - 点击这里！</p><p> So, the first wave of fast food robots did not replace all of the burger flipping employees as everyone had expected. The robots replaced middle management and significantly improved the performance of minimum wage employees. All of the other fast food chains watched the Burger-G experiment with Manna closely, and they started installing Manna systems as well. Soon, nearly every business in America that had a significant pool of minimum-wage employees was installing Manna software or something similar. They had to do it in order to compete.</p><p> 所以，第一波快餐机器人没有取代所有人都预期的所有汉堡翻转员工。机器人取代了中型管理，显着提高了最低工资员工的性能。所有其他快餐链都密切关注Manna的汉堡 -  G实验，他们也开始安装Manna Systems。很快，几乎所有在美国的企业都有一个大量的最低工资员工正在安装Manna软件或类似的东西。他们必须这样做才能竞争。 </p><p> In other words, Manna spread through the American corporate landscape like wildfire. And my dad was right. It was when all of these new Manna systems began talking to each other that things started to get uncomfortable.</p><p>换句话说，Manna通过野火等美国公司风景传播。 我的爸爸是对的。 这是所有这些新的Manna系统开始互相交谈，事情开始变得不舒服。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://marshallbrain.com/manna1">https://marshallbrain.com/manna1</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/人类/">#人类</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/views/">#views</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/manna/">#manna</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
