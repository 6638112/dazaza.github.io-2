Some 649,000 retail workers put in their notice in April, the industry\u2019s largest one-month exodus since the Labor Department began tracking such data more than 20 years ago.\n Some are finding less stressful positions at insurance agencies, marijuana dispensaries, banks and local governments, where their customer service skills are rewarded with higher wages and better benefits. Others are going back to school to learn new trades, or waiting until they are able to secure reliable child care.\n  \u201cIt was a really dismal time, and it made me realize this isn\u2019t worth it,\u201d said 23-year-old Aislinn Potts of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who left her $11-an-hour job as an aquatic specialist at a national pet chain in April to focus on writing and art. \u201cMy life isn\u2019t worth a dead-end job.\u201d\n  In interviews with more than a dozen retail workers who recently left their jobs, nearly all said the pandemic introduced new strains to already challenging work: longer hours, understaffed stores, unruly customers and even pay cuts.\n  Christina Noles spent much of the pandemic working the closing shift at a dollar store \u2014 sometimes nine consecutive days without a break \u2014 for $10.25 an hour. She felt isolated, anxious and demoralized.\n  Last month, the 34-year-old from Concord, N.C., quit, leaving the industry she\u2019s worked in for most of her adult life. Now she works from home for a local law firm \u2014 a job that, three days in, still seems too good to be true.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that feels like this must all be a dream,\u201d Noles said. \u201cThere were a lot of things I liked about retail: I love talking to people and helping them, but the pandemic made me realize it was untenable.\u201d\n  Labor professors and economists say the pandemic also made it harder for the nation\u2019s 15 million retail workers to find reliable child care and public transportation. But now that life is returning to normal, analysts say, workers have begun to realize they have options, capitalizing on the latest waves of hiring and government stimulus as catalyst for career change. Companies of all sizes, meanwhile, are offering a host of perks, from free appetizers to subsidized college courses, to attract and keep workers.\n   \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a wider understanding that these were never good jobs and they were never livable jobs,\u201d said Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University. \u201cIn many cases, the pay is below a living wage and the hours are inconsistent and insufficient. If anything, the pandemic has made retail jobs even less sustainable than they already were.\u201d\n It is too soon to tell, she said, whether the latest exodus reflects a long-term shift away from retail work. Some employees, for example, may return to the industry once child care is more readily available and other pandemic-related challenges ease, but others are turning to industries where workers are in high demand.\n  Noles said she began mulling a career change after five colleagues tested positive for the  coronavirus late last year. Her lucky break, she said, came on a particularly busy night when the checkout lines snaked to the back of the store. A customer in line, who was charmed by her upbeat nature and impressed that not a single customer left despite the wait, encouraged her to apply for an opening at her law firm. Noles applied in April and, a few weeks later, was offered the job as an intake specialist, earning $13 an hour, plus benefits.\n   With much of the country easing pandemic-era restrictions, service establishments like restaurants, gyms and salons are offering better pay and benefits to rebuild the staffs that got gutted during the crisis. Sectors like real estate, professional services, banking and insurance are also hiring \u2014 often at higher wages than retail, where median hourly pay for store employees hovers around $13 \u2014 in anticipation of renewed demand, according to Julia Pollak, a labor economist for the site ZipRecruiter.\n \u201cIn a tight labor market, we often see big shifts among workers with low earnings,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making $12 an hour and there\u2019s a job down the street offering $12.50, why not jump? There\u2019s no reason not to \u2014 which is what\u2019s happening now.\u201d\n  \u201cHiring now\u201d signs are cropping up on storefronts big and small as retailers scramble to fill openings. Many have raised wages or benefits to keep up. Target, Best Buy, Under Armour and Kay Jewelers all recently increased starting minimums to   $15 an hour, while Amazon is offering sign-on bonuses  as high as $1,000 to new employees. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n   Overall, retailers had  nearly 1 million job openings in April, more than twice as many as they did a year ago.\n Millions of retail workers were let go \u2014 unknowingly permanently \u2014 early on in the pandemic as dozens of retailers tumbled into bankruptcy, shuttered locations and sometimes liquidated thousands of stores. The result was a bifurcated industry \u2014 with booming business at supermarkets, pharmacies and hardware stores, while spending on clothing and other nonessential items tanked. Now that spending patterns are evening out again, retailers are having to hire accordingly to meet demand.\n  Some labor experts, though, say retailers are not going far enough in addressing structural problems in the industry. Retailers, they say, should be focusing more on stable schedules, safer working conditions and benefits like paid sick leave and vacation time.\n   During the pandemic, they said, many employees were also forced to take on new responsibilities, often without proper protections or adequate health-care coverage to protect them from illness. And though customers were mindful of safety restrictions early on, workers say that quickly faded, leaving them vulnerable to verbal \u2014 and sometimes physical \u2014 altercations over social distancing and mask requirements.\n Chris Overland, who sold electronics at a national chain in San Antonio, took a $4-an-hour pay cut during the pandemic before finally deciding to quit last month. The 25-year-old quickly found work in construction.\n \u201cTo be getting paid $10 an hour in the middle of a nationwide crisis, it just left a sour taste,\u201d Overland said. \u201cNow I\u2019m doing more physical labor, but it\u2019s better pay and I\u2019m having a lot more fun without the stresses of retail. It feels better, mentally.\u201d\n  Jesse Rumpca quit his job at a liquor store last month to become a firefighter for the Oregon Department of Forestry. The 29-year-old, who has a degree in geography and environmental studies, took on retail work in March when most other industries weren\u2019t hiring.\n   But as the pandemic wore on, he felt increasingly anxious about getting sick during shifts, sometimes double- or triple-masking. When he found in early May that he hadn\u2019t been informed when a close colleague tested positive for the virus, he quit on the spot.\n \u201cI kept working because I had to pay bills, but it was never going to be a long-term job,\u201d he said.\n Some workers say the pandemic made their jobs logistically difficult, if not near impossible to continue.\n Bob Beall, who is deaf and relies on reading body language and lip movements to communicate, left his position as a manager at a Lowe\u2019s store in Bennington, Ill., at the beginning of the pandemic once mask requirements made it tough to understand customers.\n  He dipped into his retirement savings and got an associate\u2019s degree. Now, after a 35-year career in retail, he\u2019s embarking on a new one with a facilities maintenance job for Kohler. He\u2019s taking a 30 percent pay cut and will be working nights, but says he\u2019s hopeful he\u2019s moving into a growing field with ample room to advance without the \u201cmental fatigue\u201d of working in a customer-facing job.\n \u201cI\u2019m making a career change at 56, so I know how this works,\u201d he said. \u201cI start at the bottom and work my way back up.\u201d\n     The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 10:50:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u4eba,workers", "title": "\u96f6\u552e\u5de5\u4eba\u6b63\u5728\u62db\u8058\u7eaa\u5f55\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u4ed8\u6b3e\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Retail workers are quitting at record rates for higher-paying work", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/21/retail-workers-quitting-jobs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u4eba", "workers"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067336, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "KATS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u662f\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u89e3\u5173\u952e\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002 KATS\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u7ad9\u5f0f\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6/\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u3002KAT\u7531Facebook\u548c\uff0339; S\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u56e2\u961f\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728PYPI\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3002\n KATS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6574\u5957\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5305\u62ec10\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e2a\u4eba\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5408\u594f\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Meta-Learning\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\uff0cQuand\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u95f4\u9694\u3002\n KATS\u652f\u6301\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5404\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b63\u8282\u6027\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u66f4\u6539\u70b9\u548c\u6162\u8d8b\u52bf\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n KAT\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u529f\u80fd\uff08TSFeature\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f65\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u3002 ", "note_en": "Kats is a toolkit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, and generalizable framework to perform time series analysis.

Ford, the first of a new class of advanced aircraft carriers, in the Atlantic Ocean about 100 miles off the coast of Florida last Friday.\n  Some common naval mines are about 2,000 pounds and can cause serious damage if detonated close enough to the hull.\n The explosive the Navy set off in testing last week, while much farther from the ship than a naval mine would be, was much larger. It was almost twice as large as the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, a rarely-used heavy munition commonly known as the &#34;Mother of All Bombs&#34; because it is the most powerful non-nuclear weapon the US has.\n     The blast, which was identified as an &#34;experimental explosion&#34; by the US Geological Survey,  was so powerful that it clocked a 3.9 on the Richter scale, the equivalent of a small earthquake.\n  The Navy declined to provide any additional information on the configuration of the explosive used in the trials, how far it was from the ship when it was detonated, or why the specific yield was chosen.\n The  Navy explained in a recent Facebook post on the explosive testing that it &#34;conducts shock trials of new ship designs using live explosives to confirm that our warships can continue to meet demanding mission requirements under harsh conditions they might encounter in battle.&#34;\n In the aftermath of the first explosive event,  the Ford&#39;s official social media pages said that &#34;the leadership and the crew demonstrated Navy readiness fighting through the shock, proving our warship can &#39;take a hit&#39; and continue our mission.&#34;\n     The Ford is the Navy&#39;s most expensive warship and features a lot of new technology, such as an electromagnetic launch system, advanced arresting gear, and advanced weapons elevators.\n The ongoing shock trials, which the Navy was ordered to carrier out before the Ford could deploy, test the survivability of these systems and others in combat.\n The Navy is making sure that the shock from a nearby ordnance detonation will not incapacitate the ship by knocking critical systems offline, including everything from the ship&#39;s radars and self-defense systems to its four hefty propellers.

So now, BioNTech plans to measure how well the vaccine, in concert with the medication Libtayo, works as a treatment for severe cases of skin cancer \u2014 and that\u2019s a big deal, because the hope\u00a0is that it will be able to treat patients who would have previously been considered terminal.\n Just like  the COVID-19 vaccine that BioNTech developed in collaboration with Pfizer, the experimental cancer vaccine  relies on mRNA technology to teach a patient\u2019s immune system how to fight off cancer. But there are some key differences between testing a vaccine for cancer and a highly-infectious virus.\n Namely, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to test a vaccine on healthy patients and then wait around to see if they happen to eventually develop severe cancer. Rather, BioNTech is recruiting existing patients with stage three or four melanoma and then tracking their progress after they\u2019re inoculated.\n   \u201cOur vision is to harness the power of the immune system against cancer and infectious diseases,\u201d BioNTech cofounder \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci  said in a press release. \u201cWe were able to demonstrate the potential of mRNA vaccines in addressing COVID-19.

with a query, it can take forever to get the job done. Take ICICI Bank, India\u2019s third largest bank and until recently my only banking partner for over six years, for an example.\n It is now in its third month in figuring out who exactly in its relationship with Amazon is supposed to re-issue me a credit card. I have moved on with my life, and it looks like they did, too, likely before they even looked at my query.\n  Small and medium-sized businesses aren\u2019t a big fan of banks, either. If you operate an early-stage startup, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if you will ever be able to convince a bank to issue you a corporate account. So of course, startups \u2014 Razorpay and Open \u2014 took it upon themselves to fix this experience.\n For consumers, too, in recent years, scores of startups have arrived on the scene to improve this banking experience. Whether  you are a teenager, or  just out of college, or a working professional, or  don\u2019t have a credit score, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan.\n But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort. And customers aren\u2019t loyal to any startup.\n \u201cA customer\u2019s relationship is always with the entity where they park their savings deposit,\u201d said  Jitendra Gupta, a high-profile entrepreneur who has spent a decade in the fintech world. Since these customers are not parking their money with fintech, \u201cthe startups have been unable to disrupt the bank. That\u2019s the hard reality.\u201d\n So what\u2019s the alternative? Gupta, who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to  Naspers\u2019 PayU) and served as managing director of PayU, has been thinking about these challenges for more than two years.\n \u201cIf you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It\u2019s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview.\n After more than a year and a half of raising about $24 million \u2014 from Sequoia Capital India, 3one4 Capital,  Amrish Rau,  Kunal Shah,  Kunal Bahl, Tanglin Venture Partners, Rainmatter and others \u2014 Gupta is ready to launch what he believes will address a lot of the issues individuals face with their banks.\n His new startup, called  Jupiter, wants to bring \u201cdelight\u201d to the banking experience, and it will launch in India on Thursday.\n \u201cWe believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,\u201d he said.\n  To be sure, Jupiter, too, will offer loans and other financial services to customers. But instead of making irrelevant calls to customers, it will assess which of its customers are running short on money and give the option to take a credit line from its app itself, he said. \u201cThe upsell doesn\u2019t need to happen by way of spam. It needs to happen by way of contextualization and personalization.\u201d\n \u201cJupiter has been built in a deep integration with the underlying bank, allowing the consumer to have a frictionless experience for all their banking needs,\u201d said Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, co-founder of CitrusPay and longtime friend of Gupta.\n The startup, which employs 115 people, has developed a number of products for customers joining on day one. The products include the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a feature first offered in the market by Jupiter, and a mutual fund portfolio analyzer. A debit card, in-app chat with a customer service agent, expense categorisation, finding the right card, determining the existing health insurance coverage, and more are ready to ship, the startup said.\n Jupiter is currently working on providing zero mark-up on forex transactions, and frictionless two-factor authentication. The startup has  published a public Trello page where it has outlined the features it is working on and when it expects to ship them, as well as features suggested by its beta-testing customers. \u201cI want to establish full transparency in what we are working on to build trust with customers,\u201d said Gupta.\n Jupiter will have its own customer relationship team that will engage with the startup\u2019s users. The startup, which last month opened a waiting list for customers to sign up, had amassed more than 25,000 applications as of two weeks ago.\n Even Jupiter, which one day wishes to disrupt the banking sector, currently has to partner with banks. Its partners are Federal Bank and Axis Bank.\n I asked Gupta about the excitement his investors see in Jupiter. \u201cEveryone believes, as you see with fintech giants such as Nubank globally, that we will become a full bank,\u201d he said.\n But for the time being, Gupta said he is not looking to partner with more banks. \u201cI don\u2019t want Jupiter to attract customers because they want to bank with Federal or Axis. I want them to come to Jupiter because they want to bank with Jupiter,\u201d he said.\n In the next 12 months, the startup hopes to serve more than 1 million customers.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:19:01", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "jitendra,veteran,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "Fintech Veteran Jitendra Gupta\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u65b0\u5c40 - \u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u94f6\u884c\u8ffd\u968f ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFintech veteran Jitendra Gupta is ready for his new inning \u2014 now he is going after banks in India\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["jitendra", "veteran", "\u94f6\u884c"]}]
