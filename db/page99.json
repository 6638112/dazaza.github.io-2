", "note_en": "Content warning: This letter discusses multiple forms of trauma, including workplace abuse, power, and manipulation, and struggles with surviving trauma.\n This letter retells my personal experiences as a former employee at IDEO, as well as stories of other alumni (who gave me permission to include their stories). This letter is a means of recovery for me and I hope it can support others on their journey of healing by giving vocabulary to behaviors that are common in an unhealthy workplace. I am compelled to name the harms I experienced as well as report on the ones that were shared with me.\n UPDATE: A new   companion piece  written by   Rachael Dietkus, LCSW , is now available. It shares a number of resources for people who have been impacted by workplace trauma.\n UPDATE 2: Another IDEO alum, Elizabeth Johansen, has shared their story called, \u201c  Breaking the trance: how I escaped IDEO\u2019s biased career labyrinth \u201d.\n UPDATE 3: Elizabeth Johanson, shares part 2 called, \u201c  IDEO equal pay commitments are very little, very late \u201d\n  In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s and Breonna Taylor\u2019s deaths in the summer of 2020, the renowned global design consultancy  IDEO announced their solidarity with Black and Brown communities on their social media accounts. That post was quickly retracted but not before being panned by both alumni of the firm and the wider design community for its performative, equity-washing  shallowness.\n  IDEO is the most recognized design firm in the world, with over 700 employees in nine global offices, generating over $100M in yearly revenue. They are known for helping Apple design the world\u2019s first mouse and have led the charge for bringing design thinking to the world of business. They play a unique role in the design industry and are often seen as the \u2018gold standard.\u2019 Competitors try to be like them, clients want to work with them, and employees want to be hired by them.\n In June 2020, undeterred, IDEO doubled down and publicly shared a new set of  commitments to racial equity. As an alum of the firm, reading the culture section (see screen capture below) resurfaced feelings that I had buried for over ten years. I was caught off-guard by how  triggering it felt. I was reminded of the times when I had been bullied and humiliated in the studio, and where my lived experience as a person of color working at the firm was consistently negative. So many  traits of white supremacy culture were rebranded as professionalism. Perfectionism, a perpetual sense of urgency, paternalism, power hoarding, fear of open conflict, and individualism were proudly on full display.\n  After seven years of working in the Chicago office, I quit in 2008, accumulating significant amounts of karmic debt designing products and services for Pepsi, BP, and Kool-Aid. I\u2019m not so naive as to look down upon all corporate design work, but I do take umbrage when a studio deliberately promotes projects about positive social good while hiding the remaining portfolio behind the secrecy of a non-disclosure agreement.\n In response to this type of rampant self-deception prevalent in the design industry, I co-founded a  studio focused exclusively on the non-profit sector in 2011. I also  teach,  write, and  present on social innovation and design ethics.\n Since I was so triggered by those social media posts, I wondered, are others having these same feelings? The response was a resounding yes. In total, 47 alumni and current employees reached out wanting to share their stories. I was blown away by the heartbreakingly consistent pattern \u2014 so many thought it was just them. They had no idea that others had suffered in the same way. Even a decade or so later, many are still coping with the fallout.\n I went on an extensive research journey, interviewing alumni about their experiences working at IDEO. I felt so overwhelmed by the weight of each story that I only talked to fewer than half of the people who originally reached out. I heard accounts of  gaslighting, micro-aggressions, bullying, and years of unprocessed workplace trauma. Who knows what other stories are going untold? I synthesized that research and saw three patterns of harm emerge: psychological risk, professional risk, and ethical risk.\n After 23 interviews over twelve months, I believe that without significant reform, IDEO is an unsafe workplace for women, PoC (People of Color) and WoC (Women of Color).\n  For some organizations, a robust culture is a huge asset. It\u2019s known, it\u2019s well understood, and it can even be written down into an employee  handbook. And to the outside world, one mostly hears a positive narrative about the firm\u2019s culture: IDEO is a grown-up playground, unbound by the rules and cubicles of lesser workplaces. And for some individuals (white males), it is. But you can\u2019t spell culture without the word cult.\n \u201cThis place is sink or swim. If you don\u2019t make it here it\u2019s \u2019cause you aren\u2019t cut out to be here,\u201d said my white, male location lead to me one day. And I remember thinking, \u201cOh thank goodness\u2014at least he\u2019s not talking about me. I\u2019ve made it in. I\u2019m safe.\u201d It\u2019s only now that I can see more clearly how manipulative this was\u2014it weaponized my own i mposter syndrome. I consistently worked 60\u201380 hour weeks, terrified that the little voice inside my head screaming, \u201cFraud!\u201d was right.\n Within my first year at the Chicago office, a well-established, senior business development leader (white, tall, older male) accused me of being a grifter \u2014 trying to game the system for money and opportunity. In my final year at the studio, another senior white, male (in the design team) decided to eviscerate me via a studio-wide email on my performance, publicly humiliating me in front of all my peers. Each time, I received no apologies, no outreach, and no validation that these attacks were completely unprofessional and unjustified. The silence was deafening. These are the unspoken rules of the studio: your performance is at risk of public shaming and abusers can cause harm with little to no consequences.\n During my interviews with other alumni of color, workplace trauma showed up again and again. And when I tried to name the feelings that were consistent across the conversations, I came across research by  Jennifer J. Freyd Ph.D., who described the kind of pain that I felt.\n \u201c  Institutional betrayal  refers to wrongdoings perpetrated by an institution upon individuals dependent on that institution, including failure to prevent or respond supportively to wrongdoings by individuals (e.g. sexual assault) committed within the context of the institution.\u201d\n I felt betrayed by the warmness of the open arms the firm presented and sobered by the coldness of the cruelty that I experienced as an employee. As with any light, there\u2019s also a shadow. But how can an organization that\u2019s been around this long, be so reticent to work on these issues? As one alum put it:\n They\u2019re just pathologically incapable of being reflective. There\u2019s no looking back on past mistakes because we\u2019re all too busy saying, \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d\n And while this kind of environment has led to much-lauded  success to the firm, it can be particularly challenging for PoC who work there. The cognitive dissonance that they encounter at IDEO (a predominately white organization) can feel like they\u2019re showing up on their first day, every day \u2014 like an interview that never ends.\n In speaking with another former employee, they recounted being called upon by the global marketing and communications team to review external content related to diversity and inclusion. Despite having a job title that didn\u2019t remotely intersect with the MarCom team, they and other employees became leadership\u2019s go-to people to represent IDEO\u2019s public voice on sensitive social issues. Even as they recounted the memory, I could hear the conflict in their voice. Getting exposure to partner-level leadership on company-wide communications came with the cost of being flattened to walking, woke spell-checkers.\n  For many, the lack of psychological safety, in turn, affects professional reputations, potential prospects, and future earnings. Those who escalate concerns and/or push back on the organization\u2019s unchecked balance of power are professionally neutered \u2014 often wiped entirely off the IDEO org chart.\n My time at IDEO is colored by the fact that I was a non-US citizen, so my entire existence in the United States was dependent on IDEO\u2019s sponsorship of my H-1B work visa. While I appreciate the non-trivial costs of the visa, it put me in a very precarious position. Speaking up about my mistreatment was always tempered by my fear of losing my job, as that also meant losing my residency.\n So when I was invited to relocate to the Bay Area for six months to work on a \u2018frozen pizza aisle innovation\u2019 project by the architecture and environments practice, I felt worried about saying no. I\u2019d never said no before. What would happen? Well, after mustering the courage to decline the project, I found out exactly what happens \u2014 I never heard from that powerful and influential team again, effectively blackballed from any further opportunities and exposure. Career death is better than being deported, I suppose.\n  An alumnus of color talked of her experience and named a phenomenon during her tenure, using a term that I had never heard before \u2014 but that eerily matched my own lived experience \u2014  from pet to threat. (This article by Erika Stallings, \u201c When Black Women Go From Office Pet to Office Threat,\u201d is a good reference for the uninitiated.)\n Because of her credentials and highly specialized knowledge, she had been brought into the studio with great fanfare. And, due to her competence and perseverance, she started to excel \u2014 the very thing that the culture purports to encourage and foster. Except excelling is the last thing that anyone in leadership actually wanted.\n You see, the offer to join the team was corrupt from the start because it wasn\u2019t the commitment to her career and her contributions to the team that she thought. Inviting her into the studio was only to burnish the social capital of the offer-makers themselves \u2014 as a demonstration of their largesse.\n And when this ultra-competent WoC asked for more responsibility, the offer was then exposed for the counterfeit it really was. Soon, this individual got suggestions to \u2018bide your time \u2014 be patient\u2019, while less qualified and less competent peers were given opportunities to improve their mediocre selves on new and challenging projects. In the mind of leadership, her requests for more responsibility meant she transitioned from a pet to a threat.\n Another former employee, Elizabeth Johansen, reached out to me when she heard of my interest in alumni stories. She had analyzed the pay equity data for IDEO U.S. by race and gender and discovered she was personally paid less than white men at the same level and career track year after year. She was pushed out of the company and never got to share her findings. Gender-based pay inequity is bad in of itself but has huge implications for company culture over time.  Read her piece here.\n The pathway to becoming a partner at IDEO means being offered a seat at that table, but you\u2019ve also got to pay for that seat. If you\u2019re being consistently paid less than your white, male colleagues, the chances of affording that partner seat (if you\u2019re even offered it in the first place) are slim to none, which reduces the chances of diversifying the monolithic bloc of white, male partners at the top.\n  After a fractious year of working in the San Francisco office while pregnant in 2019, Diana Lyman was abruptly fired while on legally protected maternity leave by her white, male manager. Diana is suing IDEO for wrongful termination with alleged claims of gender and pregnancy discrimination and retaliation, with a claim \u2014 most notably \u2014 of a failure to prevent it. Citing the public records available from the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco:\n \u2018While she was at IDEO, Plaintiff witnessed [her manager] engage in a pattern of hostile conduct towards other employees \u2014 bullying, marginalizing, and overburdening them with a heavy workload until they were forced to quit. [Her manager] had made comments to Plaintiff about another employee demonstrating his disdain for \u201chaving to pay for an entire year of maternity leave only to have them not return.\u201d\n The complaint speaks to six different escalations to HR and IDEO leadership about a hostile work environment while Diana was pregnant.\n \u201cOn one occasion, Plaintiff discussed [her manager\u2019s] treatment of her with HR and was told, \u201che\u2019s never going to change so it becomes a question of whether or not this team is the right fit for you.\u201d\n Reading these court documents had me pause and check this wasn\u2019t a script from an episode of Mad Men. Nope, this was filed in 2020. But here\u2019s the part that still gives me chills. According to one of the briefs, Diana was offered a \u2018very generous severance offer\u2019 by the company and declined. From my alumni interviews, I know of many former employees who are contractually silenced from speaking out. They\u2019re bound by an NDA as a result of their taking a paid severance or settlement package over their workplace disputes. Any lessons on how to prevent further harm are now sealed behind the impenetrable event horizon of those signed documents. That is, until this  bill passes in California, where IDEO is incorporated, that expands on the existing protections for whistleblowers in instances of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation.\n You can see the court documents yourself by visiting the SF  court website and looking for case CGC20582985. Despite the risk to her career, Diana is scheduled for trial in October 2021 in service of holding IDEO accountable.\n  At IDEO, I often heard folks use phrases like \u201cwe won\u2019t design for guns and tobacco.\u201d This was known as a moral and ethical boundary that IDEO wouldn\u2019t cross. But as I learned, many projects fell instead into a generously wide grey area of \u2018positive impact\u2019 that made me ask: positive for whom exactly?\n It seems that \u2018guns and tobacco\u2019 is more of a rhetorical strawman than an actual, formal rubric for choosing clients. Whether it\u2019s ConAgra, Rio Tinto, the DOD (Department of Defense), or the NSA (National Security Agency), employees are exposed to a variety of compromised positions that would give the gutted  Ethics in AI team at Google a run for their money.\n But is it possible to operate a reputable design studio without saying YES to everyone who calls? It might seem counterintuitive, but our studio runs through a weekly  evaluation of incoming business development opportunities with the whole team. We invite dialogue, discuss pros and cons, and often turn down projects that don\u2019t align with our mission. The largest single project that I\u2019ve personally declined was for $2M from USAID. And we\u2019re still here, 10 years later.\n According to multiple alumni, the Chicago studio&#39;s leadership held an all-staff meeting in 2013 and asked employees if they saw any issues with working with Chick-Fil-A as their next big client. Perhaps they asked because designing more human-centered fast food might contribute to the obesity epidemic, or perhaps it\u2019s because of  Chick-Fil-A\u2019s reputation for being actively anti-LGBTQ.\n However, after several members of the studio spoke up in the all-staff meeting, leadership actually reprimanded them, saying that they should know better than to speak up in front of the whole team, and highlighting how their dissenting voices carried a lot of weight in the office. Backlash like this can only have a chilling effect on any future opportunities for critical feedback.\n Predictably, the studio added Chick-Fil-A to the client roster and swept aside their own employees\u2019 concerns, putting everyone in an ethically compromised position. But why ask the team for their feedback if dissenting voices are disallowed in the first place? Why not just go full  Basecamp and say the quiet parts out loud? If they had just declared, \u201cWe\u2019re only here to make money and everything else is a distraction,\u201d then the disappointment that comes from a discussion on which projects to take on would have caused less whiplash.\n But where does this moral ambiguity come from? Well, it appears that even  David Kelley, one of the original co-founders of IDEO, is not immune to the confusion around the bright red line of guns and tobacco. In September 2019, when I was visiting the IDEO.org team in their New York office, I shared the public health disaster known as the  Juul e-cigarette case study, created by two students attending  Stanford\u2019s d.school. As I was presenting, someone from the audience quipped that David Kelley was the thesis advisor to the Juul co-founders as they developed the idea on campus. Hearing that news made my stomach drop\u2014I almost stopped the presentation right there.\n While I might be able to forgive two ambitious design bros losing their moral compass in the face of a  $15B valuation by Altria, how could David\u2019s judgment be so obtuse? How did the d.school not see the risks for a new public health crisis staring them in the face?\n  When it comes to harm at scale, IDEO\u2019s adage is still tragically true \u2014  ask for forgiveness, not permission. Perhaps the  CDC might not have had to create public safety campaigns warning teenagers of the addictive qualities of the fruit-flavored vaping product if Juul\u2019s founders weren\u2019t literally taught how to be so cavalier about the risk of designing harm. The caucacity seems boundless.\n But what happens if the stakes get even higher? From multiple alumni, I learned that IDEO created an education-focused mini-studio, called Design for Learning, or just D4L for short. Allegedly, this new mini-studio found a wealthy new client, a member of the Saudi Royal family. One alumnus described the engagement as \u201cA vanity project for the kids of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s friends and family.\u201d\n Considering the brutal killing of  Jamal Khashoggi, a well-known reporter for the Washington Post, I felt grave concern for any teammates working on projects in the region. Seeing how casually MBS approved the murder of this prominent US national, who\u2019s going to protect a team member on that project when they tweet about human rights violations by the Saudi government? I heard from multiple alumni working within D4L, who spoke about the in-country research team being sent there with little to no safety protocols in place.\n But even if the project had some risks involved, it offered very tangible value to the firm. According to several alumni, it brought years of financial stability for the new mini-studio and its leader who was trying to establish herself amongst the mostly male partners. Multiple alumni who worked within D4L spoke of the persistent pressure to perform, where long hours were frequently demanded, and the casual dismissal of boundaries when employees spoke out about work-life balance. D4L\u2019s leadership was known for being competitive and as one alumni put it, \u201cFelt the need to beat the numbers each year so she could prove herself in front of the partners.\u201d\n I\u2019ve never spoken to the leader of this studio directly, but I can only imagine the immense pressure this person must have felt, trying to make a case for this new endeavor within the larger organization, fighting to have education recognized as a viable market. But somewhere along the way, questions about unintended harm were put aside and concerns about the team\u2019s personal safety hushed into silence. For it to be considered a success, the mini-studio\u2019s finances were given top priority over all other considerations.\n Perhaps this is one of the under-documented costs of leadership at IDEO \u2014 the cost to your own personal moral compass.

Traditionally, a single machine learning model is devoted to one task, e.g. classifying images, which is known as  single-task learning (STL). There are some advantages, however, to training models to make multiple kinds of predictions on a single sample, e.g. image classification and semantic segmentation. This is known as  Multi-task learning (MTL). In this article, we discuss the motivation for MTL as well as some use cases, difficulties, and recent algorithmic advances.\n  There are various reasons that warrant the use of MTL. We know machine learning models generally require a large volume of data  for training. However, we often end up with  many tasks for which the individual datasets are  insufficiently sized to achieve good results. In this case, if some of these tasks are related, e.g. predicting many diseases and outcomes from a patient\u2019s profile, we can merge the features and labels into a single larger training dataset, so that we can take advantage of shared information from related tasks to build a sufficiently large dataset.\n MTL also improves the  generalization  of the model. Using MTL, the information learned from related tasks improves the model\u2019s ability to learn a useful representation of the data, which reduces overfitting and enhances generalization. MTL can also  reduce training time because instead of investing time training many models on multiple tasks, we train a single model.\n MTL is crucial in some cases, such as when the model will be deployed in an environment with  limited computational power. Since machine learning models often have many parameters that need to be stored in memory, for applications where the computational power is limited (e.g. edge devices), it is preferable to have a single MTL network with some shared parameters, as opposed to multiple STL models doing related tasks. For example, in self-driving cars, we need \u00a0multiple tasks to be done in  real-time, including object detection and depth estimation. Having multiple neural networks doing these tasks individually requires computational power that might not be available. Instead, using a single model trained with MTL reduces the memory requirements and speeds up inference.\n  Despite the advantages of MTL, there are some cases where the approach can actually hurt performance. During the training of an MTL network, tasks can compete with each other in order to achieve a better learning representation i.e. one or more tasks can dominate the training process. For example, when instance segmentation (segmenting a separate mask for each individual object in an image) is trained alongside semantic segmentation (classifying of objects at pixel level) in an MTL setting, the latter task often dominates the learning process unless some task balancing mechanism is employed [1].\n Furthermore, the loss function of MTL may also be more complex as a result of multiple summed losses, thereby making the optimization more difficult. In these cases, there is a negative effect of cooperating on multiple tasks, and individual networks that are trained on single tasks may perform better.\n So when should we multitask? Answering that question is difficult, but in the last few years, there have been a series of important papers that propose algorithms to  learn what and when tasks should be learned together, and when tasks should be learned separately. Here are three important papers towards that end:\n  Motivation: Generally in MTL, one of two approaches is used. One is  hard parameter sharing, in which initial layers are shared up until a certain point after which the network branches out to make predictions for individual tasks. The problem with this approach is that it forces the machine learning practitioner to specify which layers are to be shared, which may not be optimal for the tasks at hand. In  soft parameter sharing, each task is learned with  separate models and weights, but the objective function includes a loss term that encourages the parameters of the models to be similar. The downside of soft parameter sharing is the large number of parameters, especially as the number of tasks grows.\n To combine the benefits of these approaches, X. Sun et al. proposed, \u201c AdaShare: Learning What to Share for Efficient Deep Multi-Task Learning\u201d (2020) [2]. The primary goal of the researchers was to specify a single multi-layer architecture for MTL and train a  policy that determines which layers to share by multiple tasks, which layers to use for specific tasks and which layers to skip for all tasks while ensuring the model provides highest performance at its most compact form.\n  Method: The method proposed by the authors jointly optimizes the network parameters and a binary random variable  ul,k for each layer l and each task in  Tk, where  Tk represents a set of k tasks. Here, the binary random variable or policy represents which tasks are shared, skipped, or done individually by a particular block for multiple tasks. Since the policy variable is non-differentiable, the Gumbel-Softmax sampling [3] approach is used to \u00a0optimize it. The loss function proposed in the paper is the sum of the task-specific losses, a sparsity loss to encourage model compactness, and a sharing loss that encourages block sharing across tasks.\n Limitations: The main limitation of the proposed method is that it requires the model to have skip connections between layers. While such architectures have been used in prior work (e.g. ResNets), the proposed approach cannot directly be generalized to other network architectures.\n  Motivation: In order to do MTL effectively, a network needs to share related information from the input features between tasks, while also balancing the learning rates of individual tasks. In \u201c End-to-End Multi-Task Learning with Attention\u201d [4], S. Liu et al. introduce a unified approach which employs both task sharing and task balancing schemes in the learning process.\n  Method: \u00a0This approach proposed by the authors divides a neural network architecture into two parts. The first part are standard shared layers trained on all of the features and tasks. Following these shared layers, a soft-attention mechanism collects task-specific features from the shared layers, allowing the tasks to be learned end-to-end in a self-supervised fashion. In other words, these attention modules act as feature selectors for each specific task, which are fed into the second, task-specific part of the network.\n In addition, to balance the learning rates of different tasks, the authors also propose a \u201cdynamic weight averaging\u201d technique. \u00a0At the very beginning, for the first two iterations of training, the weight for each task\u2019s loss is initialized to 1. After each iteration, the weights are first adjusted to be the ratio of the losses over the previous two iterations for that task, and then soft-maxed so that they are between 0 and 1. With this technique, the weights adapt so that the tasks that are hardest to learn are given more weight during training.\n Limitations: Although this method is seemingly effective, the experiments run by the authors of this paper (as well as the other two papers we review) are mostly limited to a small number of computer vision tasks. Although the authors try the method on one dataset with up to 10 tasks, the results are not compared with other state-of-the-art MTL methods. Further evaluation is needed to understand how this method scales with increasing number and diversity of tasks.\n  Motivation: In  this paper by Trevor Standley et al. [5], the authors consider not only how to group tasks together for MTL, but also explore how much computational budget should be assigned to each group of tasks. The authors introduce a new learning framework for multi-task learning which maximizes the performance on the tasks within a given computational budget.\n  Method: To study the relationship between the sets of tasks, the authors carry out empirical studies of model performance in different settings on the Taskonomy dataset [6]. The results of the study highlight the influence of network capacity, auxiliary tasks, and the amount of training data on the task relationships and overall MTL performance.\n Based on the results of the study, the authors propose three techniques for MTL: optimal solution (OS), early stopping approximation (ESA) and higher order approximation (HOA). The first approach is based on the branch-and-bound algorithm, which uses a combinatorial approach to choose the optimal solution in the space of all the fully-trained network-task combinations, based on performance and inference time.\n Since OS can take a significant amount of time to run, the latter approaches are faster approximations. ESA reduces runtime by estimating the task relationships using results from the early stage of training and then training the chosen network configuration until convergence. HOA calculates per-task loss estimates (based on the individual tasks) and uses this estimate to approximate the performance of network configurations.\n Limitations: Since the optimal solution is based on the branch-and-bound algorithm, it has a runtime that may be infeasible as the number of tasks increases. In ESA, the correlation between the early training and final training performance is not necessarily high and hence gives misleading results for the task relationships. HOA completely ignores task interactions and nonlinear effects associated with grouping tasks together. As a consequence, both ESA and HOA suffer a degradation in prediction performance.\n  Because of the increased importance of multi-task learning, a large number of methods have been proposed to automatically learn which tasks should be jointly learned. However, these methods have not been exhaustively evaluated, especially on large numbers of tasks and on domains outside of computer vision. New methods may be needed to scale these methods to tens or hundreds of tasks and on other domains where multitasking is important, such as natural language processing and biomedical data.\n   [1] Alex Kendall, Yarin Gal, Roberto Cipolla (2018).

regularly hailed as one of the  best places to be during the coronavirus pandemic, with low case numbers, comparatively few deaths and a strict quarantine system for returning citizens and residents.\n  But authorities say parts of the country are entering the most worrisome phase of the virus fight, just as vaccinated Americans are  ditching masks and Europe  is lifting bans on travelers.\n Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales, home to Sydney, on Thursday said an outbreak of the highly infectious delta variant in the city meant it was facing \u201cperhaps the scariest period\u201d of the entire pandemic.\n  The cluster began last week with an airport limousine driver and has grown to 36 cases, including 11 announced Thursday.\n  The outbreak is minuscule by global standards, but a big deal in a country that has pursued a strategy of zero transmission. The low tolerance for even single-digit daily cases has left Australians frequently caught in cycles of new restrictions every time a cluster emerges.\n  A slow vaccination rate is exacerbating the struggle, so that well over a year into the pandemic, Sydney, Australia\u2019s most populous city, is grappling with  reinstated limits on gatherings and movements this week just as restrictions are easing in the United States and Europe.\n  The New South Wales state parliament was shut down Thursday after a lawmaker tested positive for the virus. On Wednesday, passengers had to weigh midflight whether to enter quarantine or return to Sydney after other Australian states snapped their borders shut.\n Officials and scientists are especially troubled by the apparent ease with which the delta variant, first detected in India, passes from person to person.\n  Video footage shows the limo driver infecting strangers at a shopping mall and in a cafe through only fleeting contact, which scientists say proves it is possible to catch the virus simply from sharing the same airspace as an infected person.\n   \u201cThat makes this variant extremely dangerous because of the way cases can grow exponentially,\u201d said Michael Plank, a data-modeling expert at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. \u201cAfter just three chains of transmission, there would be eight times as many cases on average. So, where the original variant might have caused 10 cases, the delta variant could cause 80 cases in the same time, which would quickly make it impossible to control without a lockdown.\u201d\n  Melbourne, in Victoria state, was locked down last month after the delta variant was detected there. So far, authorities in Sydney have stopped short of imposing a lockdown, although police said they would ensure people were complying with rules such as mask-wearing on public transportation and a ban on people from parts of Sydney from traveling outside the metro area.\n \u201cIn a pandemic, complacency has no place,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters. \u201cI am appealing to every single citizen \u2026 all of us must conform to the health advice to the letter of the law.\u201d\n   The state government on Wednesday introduced a limit of five visitors to homes in Sydney, more stringent social distancing rules, and mask-wearing at indoor venues, including workplaces.\n New Zealand is on alert, too, after a Sydney man flew to the capital, Wellington, while infectious, and spent a weekend visiting sites such as restaurants and a museum. On Thursday, New Zealand extended a pause on a quarantine-free travel bubble with New South Wales for another 12 days.\n Authorities limited gatherings in the Wellington region to fewer than 100 people on Wednesday, and masks were made compulsory on public transit.\n Right now, Plank said, vaccination coverage is too low to make much of a difference in controlling any outbreak. \u201cSo, we need to take the threat of this variant very seriously, and take the measures needed to stamp it out as quickly as possible.\u201d\n   Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, said Sydney had about a 50-50 chance of beating the outbreak without a lockdown.\n \u201cEach day you delay means that if you need a lockdown, which I think is more than likely now, it will be longer and harder,\u201d he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n     The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 01:04:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9636\u6bb5,enters,\u6089\u5c3c", "title": "\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u8bf4\uff0c\u6089\u5c3c\u5c06\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u5165\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u9636\u6bb5 ", "title_en": "Sydney enters \u2018scariest\u2019 phase of pandemic as delta variant spreads, leader says", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/24/sydney-virus-rules-outbreak-australia/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9636\u6bb5", "enters", "\u6089\u5c3c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "09d0bf66f15295d354854c6e0b9b8f1d.jpg", "infoid": 1068038, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Windows 11\u5c06\u62e5\u6709Microsoft\u56e2\u961f\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ade\u6807\u66f4\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0eApple FaceTime\u7b49\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u53f0\u8fdb\u884c\u7ade\u4e89\u3002 \u800c\u4e14\u50cfFaceTime\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u662f\u8de8\u8bbe\u5907\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u670d\u52a1\u66f4\u52a0\u786c\u4ef6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u4ece\u684c\u9762\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u5e76\u518d\u6b21\u56de\u6765\u3002  \u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u804a\u5929\u5e73\u53f0\u65f6\u6bd4\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u8be5\u600e\u4e48\u505a\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u52a8\u6447\u8fd9\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u8d2d\u4e70\u7684\u6b21\u8981Skype\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u68fa\u6750\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u9489\u5b50 2011\u5e74\u4ee585\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 \u6b63\u5982\u5b83\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e0eSkype\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u4e0e\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u7cfb\u3002  \u6240\u6709\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7248\u672c\u90fd\u5c06\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u70d8\u70e4\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u5165\u201c\u5f00\u59cb\u201d\u83dc\u5355\u3002 ", "note_en": "Windows 11 will have Microsoft Teams built in, in a bid to compete more directly with communication platforms like Apple\u2019s FaceTime.

", "note_en": "Beyond that, however, it\u2019s clear that car companies see robotics as a key investment in their future. What really struck me about the conversation, is how differently the three companies \u2013 Hyundai, Ford and Toyota \u2013 are approaching the space. If nothing else, it\u2019s a sign that there\u2019s plenty of opportunity here.\n We  wrote quite a bit about Ford\u2019s ambitions in the category several roundups ago, including an interview with Mario Santillo, who joined us for the recent panel. As evidenced by the company\u2019s recent investment in University of Michigan, Ford\u2019s approach is largely research-based. The company wants to be in on the ground floor both in terms of technology and talent. Though when I pressed Santillo about acquisitions, however, (specifically as it pertains to Digit-maker, Agility), he told me, \u201cthat\u2019s always something we\u2019re looking at.\u201d So don\u2019t rule it of, especially as other car companies begin to lockdown big names in the category.\n   Hyundai, of course, made one of the biggest robotics acquisitions in recent memory, picking up Boston Dynamics after its short stint in the Softbank portfolio (the investment firm remains a shareholder). Of course, that post-Google time has been important for the company, seeing the commercialization of Spot and the  upcoming sale of Stretch. Hyundai\u2019s Ernestine Fu shed some more light for us on the deal,  which officially closed this week,\n With New Horizon Studios, the mandate is reimagining what you can do when you combine robotics with traditional wheeled locomotion, like walking robots and walking vehicles. Obviously the technology that [Boston Dynamics] has put together plays a key role in enabling those sorts of concepts to come to life.\n  As we discussed, the driving force in the Toyota Research Institute\u2019s interest in the category Japan\u2019s aging population. Eldercare forms the basis of much of what the company does in robotics, including some home robotics research that  it showed off this week \u2013 specifically how its imaging can handle reflective and transparent surfaces. Both have traditionally been tricky for robotic systems.\n   [I]n Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That\u2019s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It\u2019s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don\u2019t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.\n  We\u2019ve been following  NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac software for a while now, and the robotic simulation software  is available as an open beta. Built on top of Omniverse, the software is designed to test a wide range of different camera and sensor capabilities for robotics. It\u2019s a fascinate project and potentially a big deal for early-stage robotics startups.\n Quick follow up to some funding last week from  a robots landscaping company, I asked iRobot what\u2019s going on with their Terra mower, which was delayed amid pandemic-related cuts. The company tells me there\u2019s still no clear timeline for the indefinitely delayed robot.\n  Miso Robotics, meanwhile,  continues to build out from Flippy, the hamburger-flipping robot with an automated beverage dispenser. The machine, created with beverage dispenser manufacturer Lancer, fully automates the process, right down to adding the cap on the cup. No clear timeline on the product yet, however, but it\u2019s fun to see some of these companies branch out in a given sector.\n  A pair of warehouse automation stories worth highlighting here.  Berkshire Grey has unveiled a bunch of new fulfillment robots. Per the company,\n This new generation of mobile robots offers increased fulfillment throughput at a lower cost point to enable shorter delivery times and support a larger number of SKUs. Unlike fixed conveyor belts and early generation mobile robots, Berkshire Grey\u2019s intelligent fleets harness the power of AI to orchestrate tens to thousands of mobile robots to pick, organize, and deliver items for a wide variety of customer and store orders.\n  The company will tell you the same thing as every robotics maker: it\u2019s all about helping retailers compete with the behemoth that is Amazon. Fittingly, the ecommerce giant also showed off  some new robots this week. Amazon says it\u2019s utilized 350,000 mobile drive units since the company acquired Kiva Systems, which formed the foundation for its Amazon Robotics wing. The post has caused  some to wonder whether, in spite of a head start and some massive funding, whether the company is beginning to fall behind a number of aggressive warehouse robotics startups.\n  Not a ton of funding news this week, but that should change soon. Hot bot summer is nearly upon us. I feel it in the air. Meantime, \u00a0please enjoy this submersible drone designed to track a wide range of creators in the mesopelagic \u201ctwilight\u201d zone. Developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,  Mesobot is designed to observe zooplankton, gelatinous animals and more, without disturbing their habitat. Here\u2019s Senior Scientist Dana Yoerger,\n We expect that Mesobot will emerge as a vital tool for observing midwater organisms for extended periods, as well as rapidly identifying species observed from vessel biosonars. Because Mesobot can survey, track, and record compelling imagery, we hope to reveal previously unknown behaviors, species interactions, morphological structures, and the use of bioluminescence.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:21:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u673a\u5668,drink,\u673a\u5668\u4eba", "title": "\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5236\u52a8\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u996e\u6599 - \u63a5\u53d7\u8005\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5668 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tYou\u2019re a carmaker, drink-taker, automator\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/robotics-roundup-17/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u673a\u5668", "drink", "\u673a\u5668\u4eba"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a19a1a30d2f2c9814d6e057a0696b876.jpg", "infoid": 1068036, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9996\u5e2d\u4ea7\u54c1\u5b98Panos Panay\u79f0\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u201c\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u201d\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u201c\u5f00\u59cb\u201d\u83dc\u5355\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u680f\u4e2d\u3002 \u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3aOS\u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u653e\u7f6eUI\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u94fa\u8bbe\u6216\u201c\u7a97\u53e3\u201d\u3002  \u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Microsoft Store\u901a\u8fc7Microsoft Store\u901a\u8fc7Amazon AppStore\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002 \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684Tiktok\u3002 \u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee5\u5782\u76f4\u7eb5\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u60a8\u6240\u671f\u671b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002  \u4f7f\u7528185\u4e07Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b0\u5185\u5bb9\u6cdb\u6d2aMicrosoft App Store  - \u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7a81\u7136\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u53ef\u7528\u3002 \u867d\u7136\u65f6\u95f4\u5c06\u8bb2\u8ff0\u6700\u7ec8\u662f\u591a\u4e48\u5584\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff08\u5185\u7f6e\u4e8e\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u6865\u4e0a\uff09\u3002 ", "note_en": "Chief Product Officer Panos Panay called the addition, \u201cjust one more small surprise,\u201d noting that the mobile apps can be integrated into the Start menu and taskbar.

Thus far, Coda\u2019s Shishir Mehrotra and investor S. Somasegar  have told us what sings in Coda\u2019s pitch doc (not deck). We\u2019ve  heard how important it is to be customer-obsessed from Toast\u2019s Aman Narang and BVP\u2019s Kent Bennett. And Fifth Wall\u2019s Brendan Wallace  laid out all the biggest opportunities in prop tech. And that was just in the last month or so.\n In July, we have more top-notch speakers on the roster, including big-name founders and seasoned investors. What\u2019s more, these speakers are ready to hear about your startup. ECL features the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can pitch their products to speakers and get live feedback.\n  So without any further ado, here is a look at the amazing speakers we have joining us in July.\n   Jordan Nof, co-founder and general partner at Tusk Venture Partners, led early investments in companies like Lemonade, Bird and Sunday. He also invested in Wheel, co-founded by Michelle Davey, an infrastructure company focused on virtual care. Join in a conversation with them on Extra Crunch Live about what it takes to raise funding and use it to the greatest effect.\n      Check out the Startup Alley companies that will exhibit at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 in an episode dedicated to the art of the pitch.\n      Sequoia Capital is one of the biggest names in VC.

They expect good outcomes to come from little preparation, which doesn\u2019t happen. The meetings are being held and progress is stilted.\n One way to save everyone significant time (and win lots of friends) would be to just get rid of all meetings, but a well-prepared and well-run session can expedite communication and get a team closer to its goals. Unfortunately, most meetings are  lazily planned and poorly run, imprisoning attendees and halting productivity.\n   No one measures the impact of their meetings. So the first step is to start keeping meeting metrics so that you can identify the bad meetings on your teams\u2019 calendars.\n  My company has created  a calendar assistant that automatically measures and stops bad meetings before they occur, but if you can\u2019t automate the prevention of bad meetings, survey and learn from attendees after the meeting to record and measure them.\n Create taxonomies and quantify the types of meetings that are being held \u2014 for example: \u201cinformation sharing,\u201d \u201cbrainstorming,\u201d \u201c1:1,\u201d \u201cdecision-making,\u201d etc.\n After several months (ideally a year) of collecting metrics, you can grade the quality and look for patterns. You will probably find something along these lines:\n Very few employees decline meetings, even when it\u2019s obvious that the meeting is going to be a doozy.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:20:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u4e1a,\u521b\u4e1a\u8005,startup,\u4f1a\u8bae", "title": "\u6539\u9769\u4f60\u7684\u521b\u4e1a\u8005\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u6587\u5316 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tReform your startup\u2019s meeting culture\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/reform-your-startups-meeting-culture/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u4e1a", "\u521b\u4e1a\u8005", "startup", "\u4f1a\u8bae"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5ba7234fa31a1e060c125beaa2e61e1c.jpeg", "infoid": 1068032, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b83\u5f52\u8fd8\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5df2\u7ecf\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5347\u7ea7\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u3002\n Ryte\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6155\u5c3c\u9ed1\u548c\u516b\u8fbe\u901a\u4e50\u961f\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u4e3a\u5176\u7f51\u7ad9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e4b\u524d\u4e3e\u884c\u4e86850\u4e07\u6b27\u5143\uff0810\u7c73\uff09\u3002\n  \u5b83\u73b0\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u201cRyte\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3KPI\u201d\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc72023\u5e74\u5ea6\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3\u4e2d\u7acb\u76845\uff05\u3002\n Ryte\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u57f9\u517b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8861\u91cf\u5ba2\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u78b3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6839\u636e\u78b3\u8f6c\u578bThinktank\uff0cShift\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c0f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u652f\u6301\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5360\u5168\u7403\u6e29\u5ba4\u6392\u653e\u76843.7\uff05\u3002\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\u968f\u7740\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0a\u5347\u3002\n Ryte\u73b0\u5df2\u4ece\u4e8b\u5176\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6Katharina Meraner\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6c14\u5019\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u6295\u5165\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u8fd9\u9879\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n Ryte\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Andy Bruckschloegl\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u201c\u76ee\u524d\u67091.89\u4ebf\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5360\u6240\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7f51\u7ad9\u76845\uff05\uff0c\u6216950\u4e07\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c2023\u5e74\u5e95\uff0c\u6c14\u5019\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u4e2d\u7acb\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u6ef4\u7b54\u4f5c\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7f51\u7ad9\u78b3\u4e2d\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u884c\u4e1a\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u771f\u6b63\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u201c\n Ryte\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e0e\u5c3c\u52a0\u62c9\u74dc\u5723\u4f55\u585e\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u9020\u6797\u9879\u76ee\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u8d2d\u4e70\u6c14\u5019\u8bc1\u4e66\u6765\u62b5\u6d88\u5176\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u6392\u653e\u3002 \n\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cRyte\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u6d4b\u91cf\u6574\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9875\u9762\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u7684CO2\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002  \u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662fad-hoc\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u5e73\u53f0\u3002 \u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\u641c\u7d22\u5c06\u5e26\u6765WebsiteCarbon\uff0cEcosistant\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u7b49\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002 \u4f46\u636e\u6211\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u670d\u52a1\u653e\u5165\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u3002  \u201c\u4e0eRyte\u5408\u4f5c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6 - \u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5173\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 Ryte\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u78b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\u4f7f\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u6240\u6709\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u4e86\u89e3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u78b3\u6392\u653e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7efc\u5408\u6c14\u5019\u884c\u52a8\u6218\u7565\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u201cTristan A.

According to carbon transition thinktank, the Shift Project, the carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet, and the systems supporting them accounts for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions. And this trend is rising rapidly as the world digitizes itself, especially post-pandemic.\n Ryte has now engaged its Data Scientist, Katharina Meraner, who has a PhD in climate science and global warming, and input from Climate Partner, to launch this new service.\n Andy Bruckschloegl, CEO of Ryte said: \u201cThere are currently 189 million active websites. Our goal is to make 5% of all active websites, or 9.5 million websites, climate neutral by the end of 2023 with the help of our platform, strong partners, social media activities, and much more. Time is ticking and making websites carbon neutral is really easy compared to other industries and processes.\u201d\n Ryte says it is also collaborating with a reforestation project in San Jose, Nicaragua, to allow its customers to offset their remaining emissions through the purchase of climate certificates.\n Using a proprietary algorithm, Ryte says it measures the code of the entire website, average page size, as well as monthly traffic by channel then produces a calculation of the amount of CO2 it uses up.\n Admittedly there are similar services but these are ad-hoc and not connected to a platform. A simple Google search will bring us sites like  Websitecarbon,  Ecosistant, and academic papers. But as far as I can tell, a startup like this hasn\u2019t put this kind of service into their platform yet.\n \u201cTeaming up with Ryte will help raise awareness on how information technology contributes to climate change \u2013 while at the same time providing tools to make a difference. Ryte\u2019s industry-leading carbon calculator enables thousands of website owners to understand their carbon footprint, to offset unavoidable carbon emissions and thus lay a basis for a comprehensive climate action strategy,\u201d commented Tristan A.

", "note_en": "In spite of that, many companies are attempting to attack the problem to produce a viable form of digital proof, sometimes called vaccine passports. For all intents and purposes, what many call a vaccine passport is simply proof you\u2019ve been vaccinated that you can carry on your smartphone, rather than on a card in your wallet.\n Some have argued against the digital approach  for privacy reasons. Others have claimed it is  a civil liberties issue, and some have pointed  to equity issues related to not having equal access to appropriate technology or the internet.\n  That lack of consensus along with the open ethical questions, has led some states including  Florida and  Georgia to ban the use of electronic passport records, at least as far as requiring them to conduct state business or to create a centralized vaccination record keeping system. In Iowa,  the governor signed a law last month that prohibits businesses and the state from requiring any proof to access services, whether the card is physical or digital.\n These are just a few examples of  the patchwork of state laws and executive orders that has resulted in even more complexity for companies trying to develop products to solve this problem. But not every state is banning digital vaccination records. Earlier this month,  California opened a registration system to request a digital record of your vaccination and New York  announced a system earlier this year to download proof of vaccination to your smartphone. More on these approaches later.\n We spoke to several experts to get their take on moving your vaccine card to the digital world to find out how this could work in spite of the obvious friction.\n  According to Dr. Shira I. Doron from Tufts Medical Center in Boston, whose specialties include infectious diseases and hospital epidemiology, it\u2019s not as simple a matter as may sound.\n For starters she says, states have not kept records in a consistent way. People have been getting vaccinated in all kinds of places from school gyms to pharmacies to stadiums, and it\u2019s not clear if those records have made their way to people\u2019s primary care physicians, assuming they even have one.\n \u201c[Vaccine passports could work] if [a system] had been rolled out that way [with central record keeping in mind] from December 15th [when we started vaccinating], but it was not. So, if somebody takes it on to go backwards and issue that kind of proof to people, maybe a system like that could work \u2014 and of course there are a lot of people that have taken issue with the ethics of that,\u201d she said.\n For her, it comes down to infection rates. As they drop with more people getting vaccinated, it could alleviate the need for any kind of proof at all because we would be safer simply because the infection rate fell below 10%. \u201cI think that more ideally we get down to such a low infection rate and such high rate of vaccination that there is no longer a concern about people walking into a building,\u201d she said.\n   If the infection rate remains higher than desirable, or certain entities like universities want to require it, how do we offer proof of vaccination beyond the paper card? Some people are pointing to the blockchain, but the approach isn\u2019t without controversy. New York State is using IBM\u2019s blockchain technology for its proof of vaccination called  Excelsior Pass, but  privacy advocates worry that doing so could expose people\u2019s personal medical information.\n The idea with the IBM approach is that you to go to your physician\u2019s healthcare portal or some other place that has your vaccine records, and which has partnered with IBM. The portal will present you with a QR code which you can take a picture of with your phone and store in your phone\u2019s digital wallet. The person then presents the QR code at a venue, which uses a companion scanning application to view it to see proof of vaccination (or a recent negative test). Finally the venue would verify the identity of that person with a secondary form of ID like a driver\u2019s license.\n The question then is why use the blockchain at all in this instance. IBM Global VP of Payer and Emerging Business Networks Eric Piscini, says that there are three main reasons. \u201cThe first is that the immutability of the blockchain is extremely important, and that\u2019s [a big reason] why we use it. The second piece, which is also very important is the decentralization of that platform so that [all of the vaccine data] is not just in one place. It\u2019s decentralized and managed by different parties. [\u2026] The third piece [\u2026] is the audit trail, and not just for me as a consumer, but as an [entity] that is trying to verify me,\u201d he explained.\n  But are those reasons enough to justify its use? Steve Wilson, an analyst at Constellation Research, who specializes in end user privacy thinks the blockchain is an inappropriate technology to use for digital proof of vaccination. \u201cBasically, I don\u2019t see how blockchain adds anything to the digitizing of COVID vaccinations or tests. The purpose of blockchain is to crowd-source agreement on the ordering of some events, and logging that order in a shared record. What problem in vaccination management does that address,\u201d he asked.\n  When California released a digital vaccination record app last week, it went a different route, using an open-source framework called the  Smart Health Cards Framework. The framework was developed by an organization called  The Commons Project (TCP) along with a broad coalition of health and technology organizations including Oracle, Microsoft, Salesforce, Epic and others.\n JP Pollack, co-founder of The Commons Project, Senior Researcher-in-Residence at Cornell Tech, and Assistant Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine, says that since the government has made clear it won\u2019t be compiling vaccine records in a central database, and because the vaccine administration system itself is so fragmented, it\u2019s even more challenging to create digital records. His organization is working to create a solution to that problem.\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re working on at  The Commons Project is a steering group called the  Vaccination Credential Initiative or VCI. And the purpose of that group is basically to design and advocate for a specification, someday hopefully a standard, that makes it so that all of those disparate issuers of vaccines can issue the same vaccine record in a signed and portable format,\u201d he said.\n That comes in the form of a Smart Health Card app that TCP has developed. \u201cThe additional layer that we have built is what turns [your vaccine] information into what we\u2019re calling the  Smart Health Card. And basically it\u2019s all of the information that goes on your CDC card \u2014 so your name, your date of birth, the type of vaccine that you received, the dates of your doses, lot numbers and where you received it. All of those kinds of things get packaged up into this credential, and that credential is then signed by the issuer,\u201d he said.\n  In addition to California, the state of Louisiana also went live with the The Commons Project solution this week, and Walmart recently announced that anyone that received their vaccine through them is now able to download a digital version of their vaccine record directly to the  CommonHealth app (available on Android) or  CommonPass app (available on iOS or Android). The company also hinted that other companies that have administered the vaccine would be following Walmart\u2019s lead in the coming weeks and providing access to digital records through the same apps.\n The approach doesn\u2019t necessarily solve all of the criticisms around equitable access to technology, privacy or the ethics of being asked to show proof vaccination, but it does provide a means to deliver the information digitally for those that want it in an open way.\n Regardless of the method your state chooses, if it indeed chooses any approach at all,\u00a0 it will come with its own set of pros and cons. The paper CDC card, as Wilson points out, is similar in many ways to the \u201c Yellow Card\u201d vaccination record that people traveling overseas have been carrying for decades, and that has worked fine.\n But it seems that in 2021 when approximately half the world\u2019s population owns a smartphone, while two-thirds have some sort of mobile phone, smart or otherwise, it makes sense to make this record available in a digital form. For the many startups and large companies trying to solve that problem, they will have to do more than come up with a clever solution. They will also need to figure out how to convince individuals, businesses and governments that it makes sense to even offer this approach, and that may be the biggest hurdle of all.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:20:17", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bfc\u822a,navigate,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u5bfc\u822a\u4f26\u7406\u96f7\u533a\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8bc1\u660e ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCompanies navigate ethical minefield to build proof of vaccination apps\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/companies-navigate-ethical-minefield-to-build-proof-of-vaccination-apps/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bfc\u822a", "navigate", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f98c8e8c03efffe977cac4c71e975843.jpg", "infoid": 1068030, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Microsoft\u5ba3\u5e03Windows 11\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7Amazon App Store\u652f\u6301Android\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff01\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5b89\u88c5\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u680f\u548c\u5f00\u59cb\u83dc\u5355\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8981\u6c42\u60a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u4eceTiktok\u5230Uber\u7684\u6240\u6709\u60a8\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684Windows  - \u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u4fbf\uff08\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5c1a\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb8\u591a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff06\uff0339;\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684PC\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\uff09\u3002\n  Microsoft Didn\uff06\uff0339;

These apps will be locally installed, meaning they will show up in the Taskbar and Start menu and not require your smartphone to function. All your favorite hits, from TikTok to Uber, will be available for your Windows-using convenience (if you&#39;re not already using many of these apps&#39; web-based PC counterparts).\n  Microsoft didn&#39;t go into much detail, but it&#39;s likely that Android apps on Windows 11 are powered by Microsoft&#39;s Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. These apps will be discoverable in the Microsoft Store.\n  Alongside this news, Microsoft  also unveiled a brand new Microsoft Store app, with a focus on being an open storefront for any app on Windows. This includes Win32, UWP, PWA, and now, Android apps. Windows 11 is expected to ship this fall, and that&#39;s when Android app support on Windows will be made available to the public.\n  This Android news is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Windows 11 news from today. We learned it&#39;ll be a  free upgrade for existing Windows users, it&#39;ll heavily feature  Microsoft Teams (poor Skype), and it&#39;ll have a whole host of new  productivity tools. With that being said, this Android development was  not expected, so it&#39;s a welcome cherry on top of the already incredible operating system-flavored sundae.\n However, even with all the announcements we did receive, it&#39;s worth noting that certain items weren&#39;t announced, such as a hard release date for Windows 11 that&#39;ll let people know exactly when they can grab the OS. And, lest we forget, there was also a lack of Surface Neo news, otherwise known as the most important item that could&#39;ve possibly been addressed.\n  Valve&#39;s class-based shooter Team Fortress 2 may be 14 years old, but myself and many others still play it on a frequent basis. Here&#39;s a look at why.\n Microsoft&#39;s current version of Windows on the market is Windows 10, which would imply that one day a Windows 11 could launch, right? Microsoft is expected to ship a large update for Windows later this year, codenamed Sun Valley, that is said to bring with it a brand new user experience with a new Start menu, sounds, iconography, and much more.\n Microsoft has announced Windows 11 today. But when can you get it? There are two answers as Windows Insiders can start testing it very soon, while the general release is later this year.

", "note_en": "LONDON \u2014 Shares of British food delivery firm  Deliveroo surged over 9% Thursday after  a U.K. court ruled that its couriers are self-employed.\n The ruling from the U.K. Court of Appeal came after the Independent Workers&#39; Union of Great Britain appealed against an earlier judgement. It&#39;s the fourth time a court has ruled Deliveroo riders are self-employed and it&#39;s a win for the  Amazon-backed company, which has been fighting to keep its riders classed as independent contractors for years.\n  Deliveroo&#39;s share price on the London Stock Exchange climbed from \u00a32.51 to around \u00a32.74 by the close, on the back of the court ruling, which was passed down by three judges who were in unanimous agreement. It comes after  Deliveroo&#39;s stock tanked in its market debut in March.\n It&#39;s the latest development in a series of legal and regulatory battles over so-called gig economy platforms. Earlier this year, Britain&#39;s Supreme Court\u00a0 ruled\u00a0that a group of Uber&#39;s drivers were workers, rather than independent contractors. Uber subsequently decided to\u00a0 reclassify all of its U.K. drivers as workers, which led to speculation as to how other gig economy apps could be affected.\n  &#34;Our message to riders is clear,&#34; they said. &#34;We will continue to back your right to work the way you want and we will continue to listen to you and respond to the things that matter to you most.&#34;\n &#34;Deliveroo&#39;s model offers the genuine flexibility that is only compatible with self-employment, providing riders with the work they tell us they value,&#34; they added. &#34;Those campaigning to remove riders&#39; flexibility do not speak for the vast majority of riders and seek to impose a way of working that riders do not want.&#34;\n  Some of Deliveroo&#39;s riders argue that they should be classified as employees, which would give them access to benefits like sick pay, holiday pay and an hourly rate.\n But Deliveroo argues that the contractor model is a better fit as it gives riders the flexibility to work when they want, and for as long as they want.\n Deliveroo said it has seen an influx of people who want to sign up as riders during the coronavirus pandemic, with up to 16,000 applications a week across the U.K. However, some Deliveroo riders  told CNBC at the start of the coronavirus pandemic they were struggling to make enough money to live off.\n Alex Marshall, IWGB president\u00a0and former courier, said in a statement that\u00a0Deliveroo couriers have been working under increasingly unfair and unsafe working conditions during the pandemic.\n &#34;The reward they have received for their Herculean effort? Deliveroo continuing to invest thousands of pounds in litigation to silence workers&#39; voices and deny them the opportunity to negotiate better terms and conditions,&#34; he said, pointing to a recent investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism which revealed riders were making as little as \u00a32 per hour.\n &#34;Is this the kind of pay workers would accept if they really were their own boss? It appears that when Deliveroo talk about flexibility and being your own boss, it is talking about the flexibility of choosing when to make poverty wages and work in unsafe conditions. The judgment recognizes that riders would benefit from organizing collectively to represent their interests and admits the conclusion reached in the judgment might seem counter intuitive.&#34;\n The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed warned that the gig economy\u00a0was in \u00a0an &#34;untenable mess.\n &#34;We urge government to step in and clear the confusion in the gig economy, which arises from the fact that while U.K. law clearly defines worker and employee status, there is still no definition of what it is to be self-employed,&#34; said Andy Chamberlain, director of policy at IPSE , in a statement.\n &#34;We believe the only way to resolve this is to write a statutory definition of self-employment into UK law \u2013 not only to secure the rights of people who should properly be classed as workers, but also to protect the freedom of legitimately self-employed people.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-25 00:12:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6cd5\u9662,court,\u9a91\u624b", "title": "\u82f1\u56fd\u4e0a\u8bc9\u89c4\u5219\u9881\u53d1\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u63d0\u4f9b\u8054\u76df\u6311\u6218\u540e\u81ea\u96c7\u4eba\u58eb\uff0c\u6cd5\u9662\u7b2c\u56db\u6b21\u88c1\u5b9a\u6d3e\u9063\u7684\u9752\u7750 ", "title_en": "UK Court of Appeal rules Deliveroo couriers are self-employed after a union challenge, the fourth time a court has ruled in Deliveroo's favor", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/24/deliveroo-stock-surges-after-court-rules-riders-are-self-employed.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6cd5\u9662", "court", "\u9a91\u624b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8ea1339dff46ea59516acb68890d41d5.jpg", "infoid": 1068028, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "B2B EDTECH Startup ClassPlus\u5728\u5176Tiger Global\u7684C\u8f6e\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e866500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 GSV Ventures\uff0cFalcon Edge\u7684AWI\uff0cBlume Ventures\u548cRTP Global\u4e5f\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6e\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662fNoida\u7684\u7b2c\u56db\u8f6e\u8d44\u91d1\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u768415\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u7531Noida\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u51fa\u3002 Sequoia Capital\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u548cBCCI\u603b\u88c1Sourav Ganguld\u4e5f\u5728\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u8f6e\u6295\u8d44\u672c\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n Entrackr\u5206\u522b\u57286\u6708\u548c4\u6708\u5206\u522b\u5728ClassPlus\u7cfb\u5217C\u4e2d\u7684\u864e\u5168\u7403\u548cGSV\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u3002\n \u867d\u7136ClassPlus\u6ca1\u6709\u900f\u9732\u5176\u4f30\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u60a8\u77e5\u9053\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4eba\u58eb\u57282\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0b\u6302\u94a9\u3002\u6839\u636eFIntrackr\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f53\u5b83\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GSV Ventures\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aTanche Count\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aTanche\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a1.4\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u65b0\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5f20\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u5347\u9ad8\u3002\n 2018\u5e74\u7531Mukul Rustagi\u548cBhaswat Agarwal\u6210\u7acb\uff0cClassPlus\u5141\u8bb8\u5bfc\u5e08\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5806\u53e0\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fd0\u884c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u6709\u7684\u6559\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u4f7f\u6559\u80b2\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u9500\u552e\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u5176\u5730\u65b9\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u53d1\u5c55\u3002 \n\u81ea\u6210\u7acb\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u666e\u62c9\u666e\u666e\u666e\u666e\u666e\u666e\u5c14\u5179\u58f0\u79f0\u57281,500\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u76841\u4e07\u5362\u6bd4\u8f85\u5bfc\u5458\u4e0a\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4e86\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e2000\u4e07\u5b66\u751f\u3002 \u636e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc780\uff05\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u6765\u81ea\u4e00\u7ea7\u4e8c\u7ea7\u548c\u4e09\u4e16\u57ce\u5e02\u3002  \u8fd9\u662fTiger Global\u57282021\u5e74\u7684Semotia\u652f\u6301\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c11\u6b21\u6295\u8d44\u3002\u672c\u5468\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5728Fintech Startup Progcap\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u9886\u5bfc\u4e862500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002 \u5b8c\u6574\u5217\u8868\u5305\u62ecKutumb\uff0cAPNA\uff0cMoglix\uff0cGroww\uff0cCred\uff0cInnovaccer\uff0cGomechanic\uff0cPlum\u548cCoinswitch Kuber\u3002  Bareback Media\u6700\u8fd1\u4ece\u4e00\u7fa4\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7b79\u96c6\u8d44\u91d1\u3002 \u4e00\u4e9b\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6216\u95f4\u63a5\u53c2\u4e0e\u7ade\u4e89\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5199\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002 \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u5e94\u4ee5\u4efb\u4f55\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u6216\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002 \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u627e\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002 ", "note_en": "B2B edtech startup Classplus has raked in $65 million in its Series C round led by Tiger Global. GSV Ventures, Falcon Edge\u2019s AWI, Blume Ventures and RTP Global also participated in the round.\n This is the fourth round  of funding raised by the Noida-based company in the last 15 months. Sequoia Capital\u2019s Surge, Times Internet and BCCI President Sourav Ganguly also invested in the company in its previous round.\n Entrackr  had exclusively reported about the upcoming investment from   Tiger Global  and   GSV Ventures  in Classplus\u2019 Series C round in June and April, respectively.\n While Classplus did not disclose its valuation, sources aware of the development pegged it in the range of $200 million. According to   Fintrackr \u2019s estimates, it was valued at around $140 million when it raised the   first tranche  of Series C round led by GSV Ventures.\n The fresh proceeds will be deployed towards expansion, ramping up hiring across engineering, operations and business development.\n Founded by Mukul Rustagi and Bhaswat Agarwal in 2018, Classplus allows tutors to run all their coaching, communication, assessments, payments, and student engagement programmes through a full-stack mobile solution.\n The company also enables educators to sell their online courses to grow their business outside their localities.\n Since its inception, Classplus claims to have digitised over 1 lakh tutors across 1,500 cities serving 20 million students. According to the  company, over 80% of its user base comes from tier II and III cities.\n This is the 11th investment by Tiger Global in a Sequoia-backed startup in 2021. Earlier this week, the New York-based fund had co-led a   $25 million round  in fintech startup Progcap. The full list includes Kutumb, Apna, Moglix, Groww, CRED, Innovaccer, GoMechanic, Plum and Coinswitch Kuber.\n          Bareback Media has recently raised funding from a group of investors.
