I wasn’t having luck getting a job. It’s a common tale.</p><p>我搬到了纽约市，我需要赚钱。我没有好运找工作。这是一个共同的故事。</p><p> My solution was to grab my typewriter that I bought at a yard sale for 10 dollars and bring it to a park. I’d write stories for people, on the spot — I wouldn’t set a price. People could pay me whatever they wanted. I knew that I had the gift of writing creatively, very quickly, and my anachronistic typewriter (and explanatory sign) would be enough to catch the eye of passersby. Someone might want something specific; they might just want a story straight from my imagination. I was prepared for either situation.</p><p> 我的解决方案是抓住我的打字机，我在院子里买了10美元，并将它带到公园。我会为人们写故事，当场 - 我不会设置价格。人们可以向我付我想要的任何东西。我知道我有创造性地写作的礼物，很快，而我的不间断打字机（和解释性符号）足以抓住路人的眼睛。有人可能想要一些具体的东西;他们可能只想要一个故事直接从我想象中。我准备好了任何一种情况。</p><p> I started at Washington Square Park. My cousin joined, which was particularly nice, since it started raining and he held an umbrella over my head. Barely anyone stopped, but there was a grand piano player and dancers to contend with. So I tried the 5th and 59th street entrance to Central Park, and was lost among the Statues of Liberty, the bubble guys, the magicians, the stand-up comic, the free hugs guy, the jugglers. At the Hans Christian Andersen memorial statue, I was writing post-card size stories for grade schoolers, mostly in the vein of Pokémon and Disney. I didn’t make a lot of money — only enough money to grab a slice of pizza on the way home.</p><p> 我开始在华盛顿广场公园。我的堂兄加入了，这很善良，因为它开始下雨，他在我的脑袋里拿着一把雨伞。勉强有人停下来，但有一个大钢琴球员和舞者争夺。所以我尝试了到中央公园的第五和第59街入口，在自由女神像，泡沫师，魔术师，站立漫画，自由拥抱家伙，戏耍者。在Hans Christian Andersen纪念雕象，我正在为年级学习者写信给卡片尺寸的故事，主要是在神奇宝贝和迪士尼的静脉中。我没有赚很多钱 - 只有足够的钱才能在回家的路上抓住一片披萨。</p><p> When I set up at the High Line, I had lines of people asking for stories. At seven to 10 minutes per a story, I had to tell people to leave and come back. It surprised me when they would do just that. I never had writer’s block, although sometimes I would stare off into space for the right word, and people watching would say, “Look! He’s thinking!” Writing is usually a lonely, solitary act. On the High Line with my typewriter, all the joy of creating narrative was infused with a performer’s high — people held their one-page flash fictions and read them and laughed and repeated lines and translated into their own languages, right in front of me. Perhaps other writers would have their nerves wracked by instant feedback on rough drafts, but all I could do was smile.</p><p> 当我在高速公路上设置时，我有关于故事的人。每位故事七到10分钟，我不得不告诉别人离开并回来。当他们做到这一点时，我会让我感到惊讶。我从来没有作家的街区，虽然有时我会盯着正确的词，人们看着，“看起来”！他在想！“写作通常是一种孤独，孤独的行为。在与我的打字机的高线上，创造叙述的所有快乐都被融入了表演者的高人，并掌握了他们的单页闪存小说，读到它们，笑着重复并翻译成他们自己的语言，就在我面前。也许其他作家将通过瞬间反馈对粗糙的草稿来吻合的神经，但我所能做的就是微笑。</p><p> Each time I went, I’d walk home, my typewriter case full of singles, my fingers ink-stained. Lots of people were worried about copycats — what if I saw someone “stealing” my idea? I tried to soothe them. If every subway guitarist had fights about who came up with the idea to play an acoustic cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” the underground would be a violent place. More violent than it already is. Others, perhaps drawn by the sounds of the typewriter, would stop and just talk to me, watch me compose a story for someone else. Then they’d shake their head and tell me that the idea and the execution were “genius.”</p><p> 每次我去的时候，我都会走回家，我的打字机案件充满了单身，我的手指墨水染色。很多人都担心模仿 - 如果我看到某人“偷”我的想法怎么办？我试图抚慰他们。如果每个地铁吉他手都争取谁想出了这个想法来玩John Lennon的“想象”的声学封面，那么地下将是一个暴力的地方。比它更暴力。其他人，也许是由打字机的声音绘制，会停止，只是跟我说话，看着我为别人撰写一个故事。然后他们会摇头告诉我这个想法和执行是“天才”。</p><p>  I woke up one day not long after I started “Roving Typist” to a flurry of emails, Facebook posts, text messages and missed calls. A picture of me typewriting had made it to the front page of Reddit. For those who don’t know, being on the front page of Reddit is hallowed ground — the notoriety of being on the front page can launch careers, start dance crazes, inspire Hollywood. In other words, ending up on the front page of Reddit meant a decent chunk of the million-plus people who log on daily saw my picture.</p><p>  我一天醒来，一天不久，我开始“肆虐的打字员”到一系列电子邮件，Facebook帖子，短信和未接来电。我打字机的图片已经进入了Reddit的首页。对于那些不知道的人来说，在Reddit的头版是神圣的地面 - 在头版上的令人荣幸能够推出职业，开始舞蹈疯狂，激发好莱坞。换句话说，在Reddit的首页上结束，意味着每天登录的百万加人数的体面块看到我的照片。</p><p>   It’s a pretty good picture, I thought. Although my shoes are beat up and missing their laces, my hands are frozen in a bizarre position, and that day was too hot for clothes that photograph well, I look deep in thought. Unfortunately, the two cute girls I was writing a story for are cropped out.</p><p>   我想，这是一个非常好的画面。虽然我的鞋子被殴打并错过了他们的鞋带，但我的双手在奇怪的位置冻结，那天对衣服的衣服太热了，我看起来很深。不幸的是，我正在写一个故事的两个可爱的女孩被播种了。 </p><p>  My sign said: “One-of-a-kind, unique Stories While You Wait. Sliding Scale — Donate What You Can!”</p><p>我的签名说：“等待的独特，独特的故事。滑块 - 捐赠你能做的！“</p><p> Without the sign, without the context, I definitely look like someone who is a bit insane. That’s how I thought of it, before I clicked to look at the hundreds of replies; I figured people were probably wondering why I would bring my typewriter to a park. And when I started reading the comments, I saw most people had already decided that I would bring my typewriter to the park because I’m a “fucking hipster.” Someone with the user handle “S2011” summed up the thoughts of the hive mind in 7 words: “Get the fuck out of my city.”</p><p> 没有这个标志，没有上下文，我绝对看起来像一个有点疯狂的人。这就是我的想法，在我点击看几百个回复之前，我的想法;我认为人们可能想知道为什么我会把打字机带到公园。当我开始阅读评论时，我看到大多数人已经决定我将打字机带到公园，因为我是一个“他妈的时髦”。用户手柄的某人“S2011”总结了7个词的蜂巢思想的想法：“让我的城市走出来。”</p><p> Illmatic707 chimed in: I have never wanted to fist fight someone so badly in my entire life.</p><p> Illmatic707 Chimed In：我从来没有想拳打在我的一生中那么厉害。</p><p> Leoatneca replied: Bet 90% of his high school did to. It’s because of these guys that bullying is so hard to stop.</p><p> Leoatneca回答说：下注90％的高中为。这是因为这些人欺凌是如此难以停止。</p><p>  There were hundreds more. A few people were my staunch defenders, asking the more trenchant commenters why they cared so much. Others started to wax nostalgic about their own typewriters. But the overwhelming negativity towards me, and the “hipster scum” I represented, was enough to make me get up from my computer, my heart racing, my hands shaking with adrenaline.</p><p>  有数百个。一些人是我的坚定的捍卫者，询问更多的尖锐评论者为什么他们如此关心。其他人开始对自己的打字机蜡怀旧。但对我来说的绝对消极情绪和“时髦渣滓”我代表，足以让我从电脑上起床，我的心脏赛车，我的手用肾上腺素摇晃。</p><p> As a member of the first generation to freely and gladly share my pictures, videos and thoughts online, I’d always — until now, anyway — adopted a “What’s the worst that could happen?” attitude, mixed with an “Everyone else is doing it!” mentality towards my online presence. Many of the best things in my life couldn’t have happened without sharing these pieces of myself online — meeting favorite authors at bars thanks to Twitter, getting another chance at a lost crush thanks to Facebook. And yet, I still felt thrown when I was presented with an image of myself that I couldn’t control. Yes, I know that I am pretty much always being watched (especially at a beautiful tourist attraction in New York City, doing something partly designed to attract attention) but that didn’t prepare for me for the reality of seeing myself taken out of context.</p><p> 作为第一代的成员，自由而乐意在线分享我的照片，视频和思想，我总是 - 直到现在，无论如何 - 通过了一个“可能发生的最糟糕？”态度，与其他人这样做！“对我在线存在的心态。我生命中的许多最好的事情都无法发生而不在线分享这些碎片 - 由于Twitter，在酒吧遇到最喜欢的作者，因为Twitter而遇到了迷失的粉碎，感谢Facebook。然而，我仍然感到抛弃，当我被自己的形象呈现我无法控制的时候。是的，我知道我一直在看（特别是在纽约市的一个美丽的旅游景点，做一些部分旨在吸引注意力的东西），但这对我来说并不准备看到自己脱离上下文的现实。</p><p> I did worry, when I started typewriting, that my stories would make it online somehow, and they would be ripped to shreds by literary, high-minded commenters. In this unrealistic dream world, I was going to defend their quick composition, their status as literary souvenirs of the city, the difficulty in writing a story while the person who is paying you looks over your shoulder, and another two or three people ask you questions while kids are asking if they can “just press one key.”</p><p> 当我开始打字时，我确实担心了，我的故事会以某种方式在线在线，他们将被文学，高情的评论者撕成碎片。在这个不切实际的梦想世界中，我要捍卫他们的快速构成，他们的状态作为城市的文学纪念品，在支付你的人看着你的肩膀上写一个故事的困难，另外两个或三个人问你问题虽然孩子们在询问他们是否可以“只是按一个键”。 </p><p> Of course I sat back down. Of course I read every single comment. I did not ready myself mentally for a barrage of hipster-hating Internet commenters critiquing me for everything: my pale skin, my outfit, my hair, my typing style, my glasses. An entire sub-thread was devoted to whether or not I had shaved legs. It was not the first time I had been labeled a “hipster.” I often wear tight jeans, big plastic-frame glasses, shirts bought at thrift stores. I listen to Vampire Weekend, understand and laugh at the references in “Portlandia.” I own and listen to vintage vinyl. The label never bothered me on its own. But with each successive violent response to the picture of me, I realized that hipsters weren’t considered a comically benign undercurrent of society. Instead, it seemed like Redditors saw hipsters and their ilk as a disease, and I was up on display as an example of depraved behavior.</p><p>当然我坐下来。当然，我读过每一个评论。我没有准备好自己在精神上为一场讨厌的互联网评论员批评我的一切：我的苍白皮肤，我的衣服，我的头发，我的打字风格，我的眼镜。整个子线程都致力于我是否剃光了腿。这不是我第一次被标记为“时髦”。我经常穿紧身牛仔裤，大型塑料框架眼镜，衬衫在旧货店买。我听吸血鬼周末，了解并嘲笑“波特兰岛”的参考。我拥有并听复古乙烯基。标签从来没有自己打扰我。但随着对我的照片的每次连续反应，我意识到赶时髦的人不被视为一个可笑的社会暗暗。相反，它看起来像Redditors看到赶时髦的人和他们的ILK作为一种疾病，我以剥夺行为的一个例子展示。</p><p> The most positive comments were the ones where I was compared to famous people — ”Doctor Who”’s David Tennant was one, the heart-of-gold porn star James Deen was another. I took the bait, eventually, and commented myself. I  explained that it was me, that I was not just bringing my typewriter to the High Line for the hell of it — it’s pretty heavy, for one, and for two, I don’t really like writing outside. I explained that I was writing stories for people. In my explanation of my cause, it became just that — a “cause.” I knew, from the smiles on people’s faces when they saw me out typing, that I was out in the world as a positive, day-brightening entity. Bashing me was like hating on an ice cream truck.</p><p> 最积极的评论是我与着名人民相比的评论 - “谁”的大卫叛徒是一个，金色的色情明星詹姆斯·德恩是另一个。我最终接受了诱饵，并发表了自己。我解释说，这是我，我不仅仅把打字机带到它的高线 - 它很重，对于一个，两个，我真的不喜欢在外面写作。我解释说我正在为人们写作故事。在我对我的原因的解释中，它变成了 - “原因”。我知道，当他们看到我打字时，从人们面对的笑容中，我在世界上作为一个积极，日白天的实体。抨击我就像在冰淇淋卡车上讨厌。</p><p> Luckily, people agreed with me. After I posted, the message board thread’s climate changed immediately. Not unlike real life, people were complimentary and kind. Many people deleted their mean comments — one person was so embarrassed for threatening to smash my typewriter that he apologized to me, and then went through and started trying to make other haters apologize.</p><p> 幸运的是，人们同意了我。发布后，留言板线程的气候立即发生变化。与现实生活不同，人们是免费的。许多人删除了他们的意思评论 - 一个人对威胁来欺骗我的打字机，他向我道歉，然后通过并开始试图让其他仇敌道歉。</p><p>  i_thrive_on_apathy: What the fuck is he going to do with that typed page? Scan it?</p><p>  i_thrive_on_apathy：他妈的他怎么办该键入的页面？扫描它？</p><p> Dlins: you do realize things have value even if they’re not digitized, right?</p><p> DLINS：你确实意识到了，即使它们没有数字化，右边也有价值吗？</p><p>  The reaction, then, had nothing to do with hipsters. It was a hatred of people that need to stand out for standing-out’s sake. That realization was at once positive and negative — people didn’t hate me because I was a hipster, they hated me because I looked like I was nakedly desperate for attention, and had gone about that attention-grabbing by glomming on to marginalized trends.</p><p>  然后，反应与赶时髦的人无关。这是一种遗憾的人需要突出突出的缘故。这种实现一度积极且消极 - 人们并不讨厌我，因为我是个时髦，他们讨厌我，因为我看起来像是令人沮丧的注意力，并通过勇敢地抓住了对边缘化趋势的关注。</p><p> It only took about 12 hours from when I saw the thread and commented for people to stop commenting almost completely. The post quickly disappeared from the front page. To tell the truth, I was disappointed. I thought something might come of it — a real job, maybe. What better proof is there for me to show that I have that go-getter’s attitude? Instead, my moment of Internet notoriety disappeared.</p><p> 当我看到线程时只花了大约12个小时，并为人们评论了几乎完全停止评论。该帖子很快就从头版中消失了。说实话，我很失望。我以为有什么可能来自它 - 也许是真正的工作。有什么更好的证据是让我表明我有那种Go-getter的态度？相反，我的互联网昭着的时刻消失了。 </p><p>    Reddit’s community has never seen an image they couldn’t write all over using white Impact font and re-post, and only a few days afterwards, someone had appropriated the picture of me and wrote,  “You’re not a real hipster until you’ve taken a typewriter to the park” in giant white letters in the unused space above and below my body. Another torrent of meanness followed on that thread, although many Redditors with good memories came to my defense.</p><p>Reddit的社区从未见过图像，他们无法使用白色影响字体和重新发布，而且只有几天后，有人们拨出了我的照片并写道，“你不是一个真正的时髦，直到你在我的身体上方和下方的未使用空间中的巨型白字母中对公园的打字机。这种螺纹跟随卑鄙的另一个庸俗，虽然许多带有美好回忆的雷迪斯来到我的防守。</p><p> Now that the meme was created, with content ready-made, it was taken from Reddit and re-posted all over the Internet. It was “pinned” over 30,000 times on Pinterest, the folks at 9gag  shared it on their various personal Facebook pages nearly 9,000 times. I was awarded the  “Look at Me!” award for October 2012 from “diehipster dot com.” Well-meaning friends took screenshots of Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter anytime they saw the picture posted or mentioned. I had gone from Reddit curiosity to “Internet meme.” My ex-girlfriend texted to ask if I was okay. My parents finally saw it. My dad didn’t know why I had dressed “funny.” My mom was understandably worried for me, flashing back to the times I was bullied in high school. I knew it made her feel powerless, just like it used to feel when I came home early from school because someone threatened to pull a knife on me. Now, it was dozens of someones — faceless and impossible to control.</p><p> 现在MEME是创建的，通过内容现成，它是从Reddit中获取并在互联网上重新发布。它在Pinterest上有超过30,000次被钉在30,000次上，9GAG的人们在他们的各种个人Facebook页面上分享了近9000次。我被授予“看着我”。奖励2012年10月来自“Diehipster Dot Com”。善意的朋友随时拍摄了Tumblr，Instagram和Twitter的截图，随时他们看到了发布或提到的图片。我已经从Reddit好奇心到了“互联网MEME”。我的前女友发短信，问我是否还好。我的父母终于看到了它。我爸爸不知道为什么我穿着“有趣”。我的妈妈对我来说是可理的，闪现回到我在高中欺负的时代。我知道它让她感到无能为力，就像我曾经在学校早早回家时一样，因为有人威胁要把刀子拉着我。现在，这是几十万人 - 不露面，无法控制。</p><p> At lunch with a friend who was trying to get her web series off the ground, she asked me how I was dealing. “Okay,” I said, “I think it would bother me more if people weren’t so complimentary in real life.” Thinking about her own troubles in creating something viral, she remarked, “It’s too bad you can’t figure out a way to exploit this somehow.” Other than sometimes posting my Twitter handle on pages where I saw the picture, I couldn’t do much. Part of me wanted to ignore it all, dismiss it like a pop-up blocker dismisses fake contest possibilities. Still, for every hateful comment online, there was a real person who picked up a short story and promised to buy a novel, if/when I wrote one.</p><p> 与一位正试图让她的网页系列的朋友一起享用午餐，她问我是如何处理的。 “好的，”我说，“如果人们在现实生活中没有那么互补，我会觉得更多。”她思考自己在创造某种病毒中的烦恼，她说，“太糟糕了，你无法弄清楚某种方式以某种方式利用这一点。”除了有时发布我的Twitter句柄，我看到图片的页面，我做得无多多多。我的一部分想要忽略它，就像一个弹出窗口忽视假冒比赛可能性。尽管如此，对于在线的每个仇恨评论，还有一个真正的人拿起一个短篇小说，并承诺购买一本小说，如果/当我写的那里。</p><p> But the vain part of me wanted to make sure the entire world knew that I wasn’t asking for attention because of some base urge to be noticed and photographed. Instead, I wanted people to know that I was nice, approachable, and able to write pretty good short stories really quickly. And that my wardrobe was more a function of my budget than hipster assimilation.</p><p> 但是，我的徒劳的一部分想要确保整个世界都知道我没有要求注意，因为有一些基本的兴奋和拍照。相反，我希望人们知道我很好，平易近地说，能够真正地编写一个非常好的短篇小说。而且我的衣橱更加担任我的预算，而不是时髦的同化。</p><p> Even after that deluge, nothing happened — the Internet has both a long memory and the attention of a goldfish. I had been cast aside for a far cuter hipster puppy. I knew that the Internet is also a content recycling machine, but that each time the picture showed up now was more like the last couple kernels of popcorn popping after the microwave is turned off.</p><p> 即使在那次洪水之后，没有发生任何事情 - 互联网具有漫长的记忆和金鱼的注意力。我被抛弃了一个远处的猎人行家小狗。我知道互联网也是一个内容回收机器，但每次现在显示的照片都更像是微波后爆米花爆裂的最后几对谷仓。</p><p> I was surprised when my ex-girlfriend called me to talk about the meme. “Would you mind if I wrote an article about this for  xoJane?” The website she referred to had a series of essays they dubbed “It Happened To Me” that they sprinkled in amongst feminist-leaning news and features. “I want to talk about how all of this makes me feel. You, all over the Internet, right after you dumped me.”</p><p> 当我的前女友叫我谈论模因时，我很惊讶。 “你介意我为xojane写了一篇关于这个的文章吗？”她提到的网站有一系列散文，他们被称为“它发生在我身上”，他们洒在女权主义倾向的新闻和功能中。 “我想谈谈所有这一切让我感受到。你，遍布互联网，在倾倒我之后。“</p><p> We had only been broken up for about a month and a half after having been together for two years. I knew that she was still hurting, and I still felt — still feel — guilty for hurting her. I thought that perhaps it was going to be good to excise some demons.</p><p> 在融合两年后，我们只被打破了大约一个月半。我知道她还是伤害，而且我仍然感到沮丧 - 仍然感到伤害她。我以为也许很高兴消除一些恶魔。 </p><p> I asked how much they paid (very little) and if she would let me read a draft before she sent it to her editor. She said yes. I was surprised to realize that people in my life were being affected by this negligible level of Internet celebrity. In the meantime, I had started a real person job at a leasing office, and my MFA program in creative writing at the New School. I didn’t have time to go out and type. Some people in the program recognized me from the Internet. Once or twice, someone stopped and asked if I was “that typewriter guy.” I felt secure in the knowledge that whatever my ex wrote, I would be fine.</p><p>我问他们支付了多少（很少），如果她在向她的编辑发送之前让我读草稿。她说是。我很惊讶地意识到我生命中的人们受到这种可忽略的互联网名人水平的影响。与此同时，我在租赁办公室开始了真正的人，我的MFA计划在新学校创意写作。我没有时间出去和键入。该计划中的一些人从互联网上承认了我。一次或两次，有人停止了，问我是否“那个打字机”。无论我的前写作什么，我都会非常安全，我会没事的。</p><p> Even though she didn’t end up showing it to me before it was published, her article —  “It Happened to Me: I Got Dumped By A Meme” — wasn’t mean-spirited. In fact, it was sweet — she barely talked about our time together, and when she did, it was fond. The article instead focused on the fact that even though she had unfriended and blocked me on every social media outlet she could find, I was still around, posted to her Facebook page, dragged through the mud on forums. She ended the piece:</p><p> 虽然在发布之前她没有最终向我展示它，但她的文章 - “发生在我身上：我被一个模因倾倒了” - 并不是卑鄙的。事实上，它很甜蜜 - 她几乎没有谈论我们的时间在一起，当她这样做时，它很喜欢。这篇文章的重点是事实上，即使她在每个社交媒体出口都有不友好并阻止我，她仍然存在，发布到她的Facebook页面，拖过论坛上的泥浆。她结束了这件作品：</p><p> “I hope this meme fades as quickly as it appeared. For my sake, and for The Ex, I hope that the Internet’s hive mind soon finds another hipster target to jab. Finally, I hope that my next boyfriend is Amish, because it seems way easier to avoid those guys online.”</p><p> “我希望这个模因似乎很快就会褪色。为了我的缘故，对于前任，我希望互联网的蜂巢心灵很快找到了刺戳的另一个时髦目标。最后，我希望我的下一个男朋友是amish，因为它似乎更容易避开那些在线的家伙。“</p><p> Unfortunately, her article ended up casting me in the same light that the picture did — she never explained that I was busking with my typewriter, and the comments section blew up all over again. Because I had broken up with her, the army of  xoJane commenters were especially nasty. JaneJaneJane wrote, “He looks like a dong and there are 1,000 more jagbags like him that you’d have to weed through in NYC before you find a cool, real-deal fella. Not to make light of your heartbreak, but consider yourself lucky. Seriously. What an assdweller.”</p><p> 不幸的是，她的文章最终以相同的光线铸造了我的照片 - 她从未解释过我与我的打字机一起使用，评论部分再次吹嘘。因为我和她分手了，Xojane评论者的军队特别讨厌。 Janejanejane写道，“他看起来像一个洞，有1000多个比他在纽约杂草杂草之前，在找到一个很酷的真实交易之前，你必须通过杂草。不要揭示你的心碎，但认为自己很幸运。严重地。什么是阿斯代尔。“</p><p> The top-rated comment, by someone who called themselves “Rutabaga,” went, “Sounds like you dodged a bullet to me. My first thought seeing that picture is that he looks absolutely insufferable.” My ex accidentally posted my personal Twitter, which has links to my website, writing and LinkedIn account. All were fodder for ridicule. She called to apologize, and I ranted back to her, mad that she hadn’t sent me the article so I could have at least been painted in a completely true light. Again, I went down into the comment rabbit hole, but the climate didn’t change like before. My intended typewriter mission didn’t matter to this crew — what mattered was I broke the author’s heart. I wasn’t going to change minds, so I closed the tab, and I tried not to think about it.</p><p> 一个名叫自己“rutabaga”的人的最高评价评论，“听起来像是躲过我的子弹。我的第一个想到这张照片是他看起来绝对无法忍受。“我的前任意外发布了我的个人推特，它有链接到我的网站，写作和LinkedIn帐户。所有人都是嘲笑。她叫道歉，我咆哮着，因为她没有给我发给我这篇文章，所以我至少可以涂上完全真正的光线。再次，我进入了评论兔洞，但气候之前没有像之前一样改变。我想要的打字机使命对这次船员来说并不重要 - 我违反了作者的心脏。我不会改变思想，所以我关闭了标签，我试图不考虑它。</p><p>   The day after the first, un-memeified picture was posted to Reddit, I went out with my typewriter, very nervous. I tweeted on my  “@rovingtypist” Twitter account that Redditors should stop by, say hello, talk about the post if they wanted. Someone responded immediately, told me that I should watch out for bullies — the message itself was more creepy than he probably meant it to be. I was nervous for nothing; a few Redditors came out, took pictures with me, grabbed a story. I was mostly finished for the evening when Carla showed up — Carla was the Brazilian tourist who took the picture of me and put it up onto Reddit. She was sweet and apologetic for the outpouring of hate, as bewildered by it as I was. She took a story as well, although I can’t remember what it was about. I messaged her when I first saw the picture posted with the meme text, letting her know that her picture had been appropriated. “I’m not concerned about it,” she said.</p><p>   在第一个之后的一天，未忆出的图片发布到Reddit，我用打字机出去，非常紧张。我推文在我的“@rovingtypist”的推特帐号中，雷迪斯特应该停止，假设你好，如果他们想要，谈论帖子。有人立即回答，告诉我，我应该注意恶霸 - 消息本身比他可能意味着更令人毛骨悚然。我没有任何紧张;一些Redditors出来了，和我一起拍照，抓住了一个故事。当Carla出现的卡拉出现时，我大部分时间都是在晚上结束 - 卡拉是拍摄我的照片并将其放在Reddit上的巴西游客。她对仇恨的出口是甜蜜而抱歉，因为我的困惑。她也拍了一个故事，虽然我不记得它是关于什么的。当我第一次看到照片发布了MEME文本时，我发了邮件，让她知道她的照片已经拨出了。 “我不关心它，”她说。</p><p>  For all the hateful words that were lobbed at me, it barely ever bubbled over from the world of online forums and websites. I received zero angry emails, only a few mean tweets. My Facebook was never broken into and vandalized — my typewriter remains unsmashed, no one has ever threatened violence towards me in real life. Instead, there are these pockets of the web that are small and ignorable, filled with hate for a picture of me, for this idea of a hipster — for the audacity of bringing a typewriter to a park.</p><p>  对于所有被砍伐的仇恨词语，它几乎没有吹过在线论坛和网站的世界。我收到了零愤怒的电子邮件，只有几个平均推文。我的Facebook从未被闯入和破坏 - 我的打字机仍然没有粉碎，没有人曾在现实生活中威胁过暴力。相反，有些袋子的袋子是小而忽略的，充满了对我的照片的仇恨，为这个时髦的想法 - 为让打字机带到公园的宣传。 </p><p> A few months later, when Christy Wampole wrote  an essay for the  New York Times bemoaning hipsters and their devotion to irony, I couldn’t help but feel empathy for all those tossed onto the web as pitiful avatars of hipsterdom. Wampole had inadvertently joined the ranks of Internet commenters who make vast, sweeping judgments based on careless observation. It was a strange experience to watch the Internet’s vitriol encapsulated as a call to action — a call for dismissal, really — from the  New York Times. When I hear someone labeled as a “hipster,” I make sure to have the opposite response. I take a second look. What Wampole, and a whirlwind of Internet commenters don’t understand is, usually, the hipster label is a compliment, a devotion to a self-evident truth.</p><p>几个月后，当Christy Wampole为纽约时报撰写了一篇文章，为纽约时代击败了震撼者，他们对讽刺的奉献，我忍不住让所有人扔到了Web上的所有人作为时髦的怜悯之王。 Wampole无意中加入了基于粗心观察的互联网评论者的行列。观看互联网的硫酸件封装为采取行动的呼叫是一种奇怪的经验 - 从纽约时报来解雇解雇。当我听到被标记为“时髦的人”时，我确保有相反的反应。我看到了第二个外观。什么是Wampole和Internet评论者的旋风不明白，通常是时髦的标签是一种恭维，是对不言而喻的真理的奉献。</p><p> Originally, it felt silly labeling my venture a “cause” while I defended myself to an anonymous horde — but now it feels anything but. The experience of being labeled and then cast aside made me realize that what many people call “hipsterism” or, what they perceive as a slavish devotion to irony, are often in fact just forms of extreme, radical sincerity. I think of Brooklyn-based “hipster” brand Mast Brothers Chocolate, which uses an old-fashioned schooner to retrieve their cacao beans, because the energy is cleaner, because they think that’s how it should be done. I think of the legions of Etsy-type handmade artist shops, of people who couldn’t make money in their profession, so found a way to make money with their art.</p><p> 最初，它感到愚蠢地标记我的风险“因为我为匿名部落捍卫自己 - 但现在感觉有任何东西。被标记的经历然后抛弃让我意识到许多人称之为“时髦主义”，或者他们认为是奴隶献身的讽刺，往往是极端，根本诚信的形式。我想到了布鲁克林的“时髦”品牌桅杆奶油兄弟巧克力，它使用了一位老式的大篷车来检索他们的可可豆，因为能量清洁，因为他们认为这是如何完成的。我想到了etsy-type手工制作艺术家商店的军团，那些无法在他们职业中赚钱的人，所以找到了一种用艺术赚钱的方法。</p><p> While I hung up my typewriter keys and stationery for the winter (typing inside is fairly loud — how did they focus on anything back in the 60s?), this summer I’ve started going back out once a week. People are as complimentary and delighted as ever. No one has mentioned the meme to me yet, although it still lives its own life; BuzzFeed used it a few months ago in  a series of pictures that promised to make you “black out with rage.” I try not to click when I see that someone, somewhere, has found it again. I prefer to let these little cesspools of cyberspace fester and then stagnate, forgotten as they should be, secure in the knowledge that I am doing something that matters to me.</p><p> 虽然我挂断了冬天的打字机钥匙和文具（打字里面是相当响亮的 - 他们是如何关注60年代的任何东西的？），今年夏天我开始每周退出一次。人们就像以前一样互补和高兴。虽然它仍然生活在我自己的生命中，但没有人提到了我的模因。 Buzzfeed在几个月前使用它在一系列的照片中承诺让您“愤怒的耻辱”。当我看到某人在某个地方时，我尽量不要点击我再次点击。我更愿意让这些小泥浆的网络空间溃烂，然后停滞不前，因为他们应该是，安全地确保我对我做的事情很重要。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theawl.com/2013/09/i-am-an-object-of-internet-ridicule-ask-me-anything/">https://www.theawl.com/2013/09/i-am-an-object-of-internet-ridicule-ask-me-anything/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/嘲笑/">#嘲笑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/internet/">#internet</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/打字机/">#打字机</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
