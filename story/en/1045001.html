His compression software helped set a standard so widespread that &#34;zipping&#34; - compressing a file - became a part of the lexicon of PC users worldwide.</p><p> 卡茨的发明将计算机文件缩小了50％到70％，以节省硬盘上的宝贵空间。他的压缩软件帮助制定了如此广泛的标准，以至于＆＃34; zipping＆＃34; -压缩文件-成为全球PC用户词典的一部分。</p><p> But the riches his genius produced were no balm for what had become a hellish life of paranoia, booze and strip clubs. Toward the end, Katz worked only sporadically, firing up his computer late at night, while filling his days with prodigious bouts of drinking and trysts with exotic dancers.</p><p> 但是，他的天才所产生的财富对于那些偏执狂，豪饮和脱衣舞俱乐部的地狱般的生活来说，可不是什么香膏。到最后，Katz只是偶尔工作，在深夜启动计算机，与此同时，每天都充斥着大量的喝酒和与异国情调的舞者的try戏。 </p><p> Katz owned a condominium in Mequon but rarely stayed there. Desperate to avoid warrants for his arrest, he bounced between cheap hotels near the airport. He got his mail at a Mailboxes Etc. store in Franklin.</p><p>卡茨（Katz）在马奎恩（Mequon）拥有一个公寓，但很少呆在那里。为了逃避逮捕令，他迫切希望在机场附近的廉价酒店之间反弹。他在富兰克林的Mailboxes Etc.商店收到邮件。</p><p> &#34;This guy did not have one friend in the world. I mean, a true friend,&#34; says Chastity Fischer, an exotic dancer who often spent time with Katz and was one of the last people to see him alive.</p><p> ＆＃34;这个人在世界上没有一个朋友。我的意思是，一个真正的朋友，＆＃34;菲舍尔（Chastity Fischer）说，他是一位异国情调的舞者，经常与卡兹（Katz）在一起，并且是最后一次见到他活着的人之一。</p><p>   Phil Katz was a quiet, asthmatic child whose athletic pursuits as a kid went no further than riding dirt bikes in his Glendale neighborhood.</p><p>   菲尔·卡兹（Phil Katz）是一个安静，哮喘的孩子，小时候对运动的追求只比在他的Glendale社区骑越野车前进。</p><p> A 1980 graduate of Nicolet High School, Katz was a &#34;geek&#34; long before that term was linked with dot-com companies and piles of money.</p><p> 卡兹（Katz）是尼科莱特高中（Nicolet High School）的1980年毕业生，是个极客。这个词很久以前就与互联网公司和大量资金联系在一起。</p><p> &#34;He was an outcast, definitely someone who was picked on,&#34; says Rick Mayer, who graduated with Katz. &#34;He spoke in a somewhat nasal tone. He was short, and, well I don&#39;t want to say homely, so I&#39;ll say he was plain looking.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他是一个流浪者，绝对是被选中的人，＆＃34;卡茨（Katz）毕业的里克·梅耶（Rick Mayer）说。 ＆＃34;他的语调有些鼻腔。他矮了，而且，我不想说家常便饭，所以我会说他长相朴实。</p><p> After hearing of Katz&#39;s death, Ray Fedderly, a Milwaukee cardiologist who sat next to Katz in high school honors math and physics classes, opened his high school yearbook and found an angst-ridden message.</p><p> 听到卡兹（Katz）死后，密尔沃基（Milwaukee）心脏病学家雷·费德利（Ray Fedderly）在高中时就坐在卡兹（Katz）旁边，为数学和物理班授课，他打开了他的高中年鉴，发现了一条充满焦虑的讯息。</p><p> &#34;I enjoyed working with you in mathematics and physics classes through the four terrible, long, unbearable, tortuous, but wonderful years at Nicolet,&#34; Katz wrote. &#34;I hope your future is bright and your life is happy (if possible). May a calculator bring great happiness to you.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我喜欢从四个可怕的，长的，难以忍受的，曲折的，但美好的岁月在尼与您携手在数学和物理课，＆＃34;卡茨写道。 ＆＃34;希望您的前途一片光明，生活幸福（如果可能）。希望计算器为您带来极大的快乐。＆＃34; </p><p> &#34;If I were a physician as I am now when I was 18, I would have known what to do with that note,&#34; Fedderly says. &#34;I now know that that was a call for help. That was not a joke.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;如果我像我18岁时一样是医生，那么我会知道该怎么做，＆＃34;联邦快递说。 ＆＃34;我现在知道那是寻求帮助。那不是在开玩笑。＆＃34;</p><p>  Katz and his father, Walter, spent weekend afternoons playing chess and evenings writing code for programmable calculators in the days before PCs forever changed computing.</p><p>  卡茨和他的父亲沃尔特（Walter）在周末下午下棋和晚上，在PC永远改变计算之前的日子里为可编程计算器编写代码。</p><p> Since programmable calculators had very little memory, Phil and Walter had to work very efficiently.</p><p> 由于可编程计算器的内存很少，因此Phil和Walter必须非常高效地工作。</p><p> &#34;The earliest program I remember him writing was a game program that dealt with landing on the moon,&#34; says Brian Kiehnau, Katz&#39;s former brother-in-law who met him in 1977.</p><p> ＆＃34;我记得他写的最早的程序是一个处理登陆月球的游戏程序，＆＃34;卡兹（Katz）的前姐夫布莱恩·基瑙（Brian Kiehnau）于1977年与他见面。</p><p> &#34;It was very crude and simple, but it was complex for what he had in terms of hardware. He got real good at optimizing programs, and he learned to get the job done with the least amount of instructions and running times.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这非常粗糙和简单，但是就硬件而言，这很复杂。他非常擅长优化程序，并且学会了以最少的指令和运行时间完成任务。＆＃34;</p><p> In 1980, Katz entered the computer science program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Around the same time, Walter and Hildegard Katz bought Phil his first computer, an original IBM PC. It had two floppy drives, a monochrome monitor and 64K of memory, an astoundingly small amount compared with today&#39;s machines.</p><p> 1980年，Katz进入了威斯康星州密尔沃基大学的计算机科学专业。大约在同一时间，Walter和Hildegard Katz买了Phil的第一台计算机，即原始的IBM PC。它有两个软盘驱动器，一个单色显示器和64K内存，与当今的机器相比，数量惊人地少。</p><p> Once he got the PC, Katz started writing programs, spending most of his free time on electronic bulletin board services, the precursors of the Internet.</p><p> 一旦获得了PC，Katz就开始编写程序，将大部分的空闲时间都花在电子公告牌服务（Internet的前身）上。 </p><p> The services quickly became Katz&#39;s social circle, a place where he hooked up with others who understood his sophisticated programming techniques and shared his passion for computers.</p><p>这些服务迅速成为Katz的社交圈，在那里他与其他了解他先进的编程技术并分享了对计算机的热情的人联系在一起。</p><p> Gradually, Katz developed a fondness for sharing information on the services, since interacting with others helped make his programs better. Those experiences would influence Katz to embrace the &#34;shareware&#34; approach to distributing PKWare&#39;s software. With shareware, users try a product, and if they find it valuable, pay the person who created it. In the case of PKWare, users paid $47 and received a manual and free upgrades.</p><p> 渐渐地，Katz对共享服务信息产生了浓厚的兴趣，因为与他人的互动帮助他改善了自己的程序。这些经历会影响Katz接受＆＃34; shareware＆＃34;分发PKWare软件的方法。使用共享软件，用户可以试用产品，如果发现有价值，请向创建该产品的人付款。对于PKWare，用户支付了47美元，并获得了手册和免费升级。</p><p> &#34;He spent many, many hours talking to people and helping people. He would go to computer user groups and spend hours with them,&#34; Hildegard Katz says. &#34;He was very, very, giving. This was his great love.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他花了很多小时与人交谈和帮助人们。他将前往计算机用户组并与他们一起度过数小时，＆＃34;希尔德加德·卡兹（Hildegard Katz）说。 ＆＃34;他非常非常奉献。这是他的挚爱。＆＃34;</p><p> But in the spring of 1981, tragedy overtook the family, and things would never be the same for Phil Katz.</p><p> 但是在1981年春天，悲剧笼罩了整个家庭，对于菲尔·卡兹（Phil Katz）来说，情况将永远不同。</p><p> Walter, 55, plagued by recurring chest pains, underwent open heart surgery. Within hours, he was dead.</p><p> 现年55岁的沃尔特因反复出现的胸痛而接受了心脏直视手术。几个小时之内，他死了。</p><p> Phil Katz took his father&#39;s death very hard. Years later, in the haze of his drinking binges, Katz told Fischer how the loss had affected him.</p><p> 菲尔·卡兹（Phil Katz）十分努力地对待父亲的死。多年后，卡兹在饮酒的阴霾中告诉菲舍尔，损失如何影响了他。</p><p> &#34;It tore him up inside when his father died. One time we went to his grave,&#34; Fischer says. &#34;He&#39;d always say that when his father was alive they&#39;d go fishing and do man things.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;父亲去世时，这把他撕成碎片。有一次我们去了他的坟墓，菲舍尔说。他总是说，当他父亲还活着的时候，他们会去钓鱼，做些男人的事。 </p><p> Walter&#39;s death drove his son further into solitude and deeper into a one-on-one relationship with his computer, say friends and family members.</p><p>朋友和家人说，沃尔特（Walter）的死使他的儿子更加孤独，并与他的计算机形成了一对一的关系。</p><p>  Katz graduated with a computer science degree in 1984and was hired as a programmer for Allen-Bradley Co. He wrote code to run &#34;programmable logic controllers,&#34; which operate manufacturing equipment on shop floors worldwide for Allen-Bradley&#39;s customers.</p><p>  Katz于1984年获得计算机科学学位，并被聘为Allen-Bradley Co.的程序员。他编写代码来运行“可编程逻辑控制器”。该公司在全球范围内为Allen-Bradley客户提供生产设备。</p><p> Katz left Allen-Bradley in 1986 to work for Graysoft, a Milwaukee-based software company. He spent evenings holed up in his bedroom writing his own programs.</p><p> Katz于1986年离开Allen-Bradley，为总部位于密尔沃基的软件公司Graysoft工作。他在自己的卧室里度过一个漫长的夜晚，编写自己的节目。</p><p> His project: An alternative to Arc, the then-common program for compressing files. Using algorithms, Katz wrote programs that imploded information by telling it, for example, to take every &#34;a-n-d&#34; out of text. That would eliminate every &#34;and,&#34; &#34;hand,&#34; and &#34;sand.&#34; A good program takes out these and thousands of other combinations of letters and restores them when needed.</p><p> 他的项目：替代当时流行的压缩文件程序Arc。 Katz使用算法编写了程序，通过告知信息例如获取每一个＆nbsp; a-n-d＆＃34;来爆破信息。没有文字。这样可以消除所有＆＃34; and＆＃34; ＆＃34;手，＆＃34;和＆＃34;沙。＆＃34;一个好的程序可以取出这些字母以及成千上万个其他字母组合，并在需要时将其还原。</p><p> Katz bounced early versions of the software, called PKArc, off his buddies on the bulletin boards and spent countless hours refining it. By 1987, the software had created such a buzz online that PKArc started to steal market share from Arc&#39;s creator, System Enhancement Associates of New Jersey.</p><p> Katz从他的好友在公告板上反弹了称为PKArc的软件的早期版本，并花费了无数小时对其进行完善。到1987年，该软件已经在网上引起了轩然大波，以至PKArc开始从Arc的创建者新泽西的System Enhancement Associates手中抢夺市场份额。</p><p> &#34;I got a check in the mail and I thought, &#39;Gee!&#39; that&#39;s pretty neat,&#34; Katz said in a 1994 interview with the Journal Sentinel. &#34;Then over the next few months, I got more checks in the mail.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我收到了一封支票，我以为，“ Gee！”那很整洁，卡茨（Katz）在1994年接受《哨兵杂志》采访时说。 ＆＃34;然后在接下来的几个月中，我在邮件中收到了更多支票。</p><p>  &#34;People kept calling him saying, &#39;We would like to use your software, and we want to pay you money for it,&#39; &#34; Hildegard says.</p><p>  人们不停地打电话给他说：“我们想使用您的软件，但我们想为此付费给您，” ＆＃34;希尔德加德说。 </p><p> Katz left Graysoft in 1987 to strike out on his own. PKArc&#39;s sales dwarfed his Graysoft salary, which was in the low-$30,000 range, says Steve Burg, a former Graysoft programmer who joined PKWare in 1988.</p><p>卡兹（Katz）于1987年离开Graysoft自行罢工。 1988年加入PKWare的前Graysoft程序员史蒂夫·伯格（Steve Burg）说，PKArc的销售额使他的Graysoft薪水相形见,，后者仅为30,000美元左右。</p><p> In the beginning, Katz did most of his work at Hildegard&#39;s kitchen table. They hired an answering service to handle the flood of phone calls, and offered Burg a job as a developer.</p><p> 最初，Katz在Hildegard的厨房桌子上做了大部分工作。他们雇用了应答服务来处理大量电话，并为Burg提供了一份开发人员的工作。</p><p>  &#34;He was extremely intelligent,&#34; says Doug Hay, who joined the company in 1988 and stayed until June of last year. &#34;He had all the equations from exams memorized from 10 years earlier, things you generally forget 20 minutes after the test.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;他非常聪明，＆＃34;道格·海伊（Doug Hay）说，他于1988年加入公司，并一直待到去年6月。 ＆＃34;他记忆了10年前的所有考试方程式，在考试后20分钟，您通常会忘记这一点。</p><p> Almost overnight, denizens of the bulletin boards switched from .arc compression to .zip in what became known as the arc wars.</p><p> 几乎一夜之间，公告板的居民从.arc压缩转换为.zip，这就是所谓的电弧战争。</p><p> System Enhancement sued PKWare in 1988 for copyright and trademark infringement. In 1989, as his legal costs mounted, Katz agreed to settle. Full terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but representatives of the New Jersey company may have been surprised when they finally met their nemesis.</p><p> 1988年，System Enhancement起诉PKWare侵犯版权和商标权。 1989年，随着法律费用的增加，Katz同意和解。和解的全部条款尚未透露，但新泽西公司的代表们最终遇到敌人时可能会感到惊讶。</p><p> &#34;The lawyer for System Enhancement showed up at Hildegard&#39;s house expecting a big company,&#34; Kiehnau says. &#34;He had an address from the bulletin boards, so he thought there would be a big glass building or something. It was really funny.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;系统增强律师出现在希尔达德（Hildegard）的房子里，期待一家大公司，＆＃34; Kiehnau说。 ＆＃34;他在公告板上有一个地址，所以他认为这里会有一座大玻璃建筑或其他东西。真的很有趣。＆＃34;</p><p> Publicity about the lawsuit on bulletin board services nationwide helped fuel a backlash against System Enhancement, which accelerated the death of .arc as PKWare introduced new, incompatible archival tools with better compression algorithms.</p><p> 全国范围内公告板服务诉讼的宣传加剧了对系统增强的强烈反对，随着PKWare引入了具有更好压缩算法的新的，不兼容的存档工具，加速了.arc的失败。 </p><p>  &#34;Phil became a very wealthy man in a very short period of time,&#34; Burg says.</p><p>菲尔（Phil）在很短的时间内就变得非常富有，伯格说。</p><p> While Hildegard worked to keep business matters in check, Katz devoted nearly all his time to programming. He didn&#39;t come to work until late afternoon and worked well into the night, so he could have complete silence and not have to interact with anybody, early PKWare employees say.</p><p> 在希尔德加德（Hildegard）努力控制业务事务的同时，卡茨（Katz）几乎所有时间都花在编程上。 PKWare的早期员工说，他直到下午晚些时候才来上班，并且一直工作到深夜，所以他可以保持完全的沉默，而不必与任何人互动。</p><p> &#34;He was rarely around. He did what he had to,&#34; Kiehnau says. &#34;If the business would have went belly up two years after it started, I don&#39;t think he would have cared.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他很少在附近。他做了他必须要做的，＆＃34; Kiehnau说。 ＆＃34;如果公司在开业两年后就破产了，我不认为他会在意的。</p><p> But Katz&#39;s unpredictable schedule frustrated his family. &#34;They&#39;d say &#39;You have this business, and it&#39;s growing. Why aren&#39;t you here?&#34; Kiehnau says.</p><p> 但是卡茨的不可预测的时间表使他的家人感到沮丧。他们说您有这项业务，而且还在不断增长。你为什么不在这里？ Kiehnau说。</p><p> During his frequent absences, Katz kept in touch with Hildegard and PKWare executives through electronic fax services. He oversaw product upgrades and revisions, and occasionally gave Hildegard instructions on business matters.</p><p> 在他经常缺席期间，Katz通过电子传真服务与Hildegard和PKWare高管保持联系。他监督产品的升级和修订，并偶尔向Hildegard提供有关业务事项的说明。</p><p> As his business grew, his personal life unraveled. Hildegard heard rumors her son was going to strip bars, cavorting with women and drinking heavily. She questioned him about his personal affairs, people who know the family say, and the relationship between the worried mom and wayward son began to fray.</p><p> 随着他业务的发展，他的个人生活逐渐瓦解。希尔德加德（Hildegard）听到谣言说她儿子准备脱酒吧，与妇女打招呼和大量饮酒。她向他询问他的个人事务，知情人士说，以及担心的妈妈和任性的儿子之间的关系开始磨ray。</p><p> They also squabbled when Katz tried to take money out of PKWare. He sometimes wanted as much as $25,000, Kiehnau says.</p><p> 当卡茨试图从PKWare取钱时，他们也吵起来。 Kiehnau说，他有时有时想要多达25,000美元。 </p><p> &#34;He thought it was ridiculous that a 30-year-old man would have to beg his mother for a check from his own company,&#34; Kiehnau says.</p><p>＆＃34;他以为，一个30岁的男人不得不乞求母亲去他自己公司的支票上，这很荒谬， Kiehnau说。</p><p> Katz grew bitter over his mother&#39;s interference in his affairs. Eventually, he stopped talking to her altogether. The end came one day in 1995.</p><p> 卡茨因母亲对他的事务的干预而感到痛苦。最终，他完全停止和她说话。 1995年的一天结束了。</p><p> Hildegard received a fax informing her that her son planned a hostile buyout of her 25% equity stake. He had fired his own mother.</p><p> Hildegard收到传真，通知她她的儿子计划以恶意方式收购其25％的股份。他解雇了自己的母亲。</p><p> &#34;It was like a funeral the day it happened,&#34; Kiehnau recalls. &#34;It was his product, but it was her business. (Kiehnau&#39;s former wife) Cindi and I got called over to her house and she was crying and crying, &#39;Why would Phil do this?&#39; &#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;发生的日子就像一场葬礼， Kiehnau回忆。 ＆＃34;这是他的产品，但这是她的事。 （基瑙的前妻）辛迪和我被叫到她家，她在哭又哭，为什么菲尔要这么做？ ＆＃34;</p><p> That same year, Katz hired Robert Gorman as director of marketing and sales. Gorman had previously worked in sales for Frontier Technologies, a Milwaukee-based developer of Internet software.</p><p> 同年，卡茨（Katz）聘请罗伯特·戈尔曼（Robert Gorman）为市场和销售总监。高曼之前曾在Frontier Technologies从事销售工作，Frontier Technologies是一家位于密尔沃基的互联网软件开发商。</p><p> Gorman maintains that Katz continued to manage the company, but others close to the situation say Katz&#39;s day-to-day role was minimal. Although he signed off on major decisions and worked on product upgrades, the company was run by PKWare management, they say.</p><p> Gorman坚持认为Katz继续管理公司，但其他接近情况的人则说Katz的日常角色微乎其微。他们说，尽管他签署了重大决定并致力于产品升级，但该公司仍由PKWare管理层运营。</p><p> Despite the turmoil, PKWare&#39;s business remained strong through the 1990s, says Richard Holler, executive director of the Association of Shareware Professionals in Greenwood, Ind.</p><p> 尽管动荡不安，但PKWare的业务在1990年代仍然保持强劲，印第安纳州格林伍德的共享软件专业人士协会执行理事Richard Holler说。 </p><p> It is difficult to measure the company&#39;s market share because not all shareware users end up licensing the product. But even as Windows-based &#34;zip&#34; products nibbled into PKWare&#39;s sales, the company&#39;s business held up, he says.</p><p>很难衡量公司的市场份额，因为并非所有共享软件用户最终都会获得产品许可。但即使是基于Windows的＆＃34; zip＆＃34;他说，产品蚕食了PKWare的销售，公司业务因此停滞不前。</p><p> &#34;They are still a big player in the commercial marketplace. They have a lot of ongoing relationships with other software developers that use the PKZip compression algorithm within their own products,&#34; Holler says.</p><p> ＆＃34;他们仍然是商业市场中的重要角色。他们与在自己的产品中使用PKZip压缩算法的其他软件开发人员保持着长期的合作关系，＆＃34;霍勒说。</p><p> At the time of his death, Phil Katz was remembered among the world&#39;s elite programmers for writing a truly revolutionary piece of software. But that single accomplishment, as significant and profitable as it was, couldn&#39;t save Katz&#39;s life.</p><p> 菲尔·卡兹（Phil Katz）逝世时，他因编写了真正具有革命性的软件而在世界顶级程序员中广为人知。但是，尽管如此，这项成就尽管意义非凡，却无法赚钱，无法挽救卡茨的性命。</p><p>  Katz talked freer, laughed harder, stayed up longer and dreamed bigger when he had a drink in his hand, friends say. Drinking brought a painfully shy man out of his shell.</p><p>  朋友们说，当卡茨手里拿着一杯饮料时，他的讲话更加自由自在，笑得更厉害，熬了更长的时间并梦想着更大。喝酒使一个痛苦而害羞的人从他的外壳中脱出。</p><p> &#34;As soon as he started drinking, you could see a little smile on his face. That&#39;s when he could talk to people, or tell a joke. When he didn&#39;t drink, he would pick jokes apart. He would think really deep and wouldn&#39;t have as much fun,&#34; says Fischer, the dancer who met Katz in 1994 and grew fond of him.</p><p> ＆＃34;他开始喝酒后，他的脸上就会露出一点微笑。那是他可以与人交谈或开玩笑的时候。当他不喝酒时，他会开玩笑。他会想的很深，不会有那么多的乐趣，费舍尔（Fischer）说，他是1994年遇见卡兹的舞者，并对此非常喜欢。</p><p>  On May 7, 1991, as he was driving his 1990 Nissan 300ZX with plates that read PKWARE, a police officer ordered Katz to pull over. Katz was sitting in the driver&#39;s seat, his glassy eyes nearly closed, according to the police report. He was convicted of operating under the influence of an intoxicant.</p><p>  1991年5月7日，当他驾驶1990年的日产300ZX带有标有PKWARE的车牌时，一名警察下令Katz停下来。据警方报告，卡兹正坐在驾驶座上，他的玻璃般的眼睛几乎闭上了。他因在醉酒影响下进行手术而被定罪。</p><p>  About a year later, Katz was again convicted of drunken driving. Between 1994 and September 1999, Katz was arrested five times for operating after suspension or revocation of his license. Records show that courts issued six warrants related to his driving, including two for bail jumping.</p><p>  大约一年后，Katz再次因醉酒驾驶被定罪。在1994年至1999年9月期间，Katz因吊销执照或吊销执照而被捕五次。记录显示，法院签发了与他的驾驶有关的六份逮捕令，其中两份是关于保释的。 </p><p> Once the authorities starting looking for him, Katz started showing up at work a lot less often.</p><p>当局开始寻找他之后，卡茨开始很少出现在工作中。</p><p> &#34;He just disappeared,&#34; Hay says. &#34;Sometimes you would see him at trade shows, but that was about it.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他不见了，＆＃34;海伊说。 ＆＃34;有时候您会在贸易展览会上见到他，但仅此而已。</p><p>  &#34;He lived in a state of paranoia,&#34; says one former employee, who asked not to be identified. &#34;He thought that (WITI-TV Channel 6) across the street from us was watching him.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;他生活在偏执状态，＆＃34;一位不愿透露姓名的前雇员说。 ＆＃34;他以为我们对面的（WITI-TV 6频道）在看着他。</p><p> Katz knew that if authorities were looking for him at PKWare, they probably were also trying to find him at the handsome, brown-brick luxury condominium he owned near Mequon Country Club.</p><p> 卡茨知道，如果当局在PKWare上寻找他，他们可能还试图在他在Mequon乡村俱乐部附近拥有的英俊的棕褐色豪华公寓里找到他。</p><p> His neighbors, unaware of his legal problems, were baffled by Katz&#39;s reclusive nature. Many say they had never seen or met Katz even though he supposedly had lived there for almost five years.</p><p> 他的邻居不知道他的法律问题，对卡茨的隐逸性感到困惑。许多人说，即使据说卡茨在那住了近五年，他们也从未见过或见过。</p><p> &#34;I never saw a light on, I never saw tire tracks in his driveway, and I live across the street. It was almost spooky,&#34; says Peter Picus, a neighbor.</p><p> ＆＃34;我从未见过灯，也从未见过他车道上的轮胎痕迹，而且我住在马路对面。这简直是​​令人毛骨悚然，＆＃34;邻居彼得·皮库斯（Peter Picus）说。</p><p> The condominium was in the eye of a publicity storm in August 1997 after neighbors complained about a stench emanating from the home and mice and insects scurrying near the unit.</p><p> 由于邻居抱怨家中散发出恶臭以及在该单位附近乱窜的老鼠和昆虫，该公寓在1997年8月的宣传风暴眼中。 </p><p> Mequon authorities obtained a search warrant to enter the condominium, after neighbors and inspectors were unable to locate Katz. They found a stinking mass of garbage, sex magazines, videos and sex toys like whips and chains, according to Kenneth Metzger, former general sanitarian for the City of Mequon.</p><p>在邻居和检查人员无法找到卡兹之后，马奎因当局获得了进入该公寓的搜查令。麦奎因市前一般卫生人员肯尼斯·梅茨格（Kenneth Metzger）表示，他们发现了大量的垃圾，色情杂志，录像带和鞭子和铁链等性玩具。</p><p> &#34;It was a mess. I had been in the business for more than 40 years, and it was one of the worst that I had seen,&#34; Metzger says. &#34;It was knee deep in garbage. There were bottles, cans and rotting fast-food stuff all over the place. Whatever happened to that man, he went off the deep end.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;真是一团糟。我从事这项业务已有40多年了，这是我所见过的最糟糕的经历之一，＆＃34;梅茨格说。 ＆＃34;那是膝盖深处的垃圾。到处都有瓶子，罐子和腐烂的快餐。不管那个男人发生什么事，他都走出了深渊。</p><p> Though Metzger and his crew knew little about the evasive Katz, they could tell that he was wealthy. Among all the rubbish, they found credit cards, money, a laptop computer and jewelry that had never been opened.</p><p> 尽管Metzger和他的工作人员对逃脱的Katz知之甚少，但他们可以说他很富有。在所有垃圾中，他们发现了从未打开过的信用卡，金钱，便携式计算机和珠宝。</p><p> Publicity about the discoveries hurt Katz deeply, friends say, and some say it marked the beginning oftheend.</p><p> 朋友们说，对这些发现的公开报道深深地伤害了卡茨，有人说这标志着开始的开始。</p><p> &#34;When they raided his house, they exploited it and told everybody at his company about his fetish. His mother found out, everybody found out,&#34; Fischer says.</p><p> ＆＃34;当他们突袭他的房子时，他们将其剥削，并告诉他公司的所有人有关他的恋物癖。他的母亲发现了，每个人都发现了，＆＃34;菲舍尔说。</p><p> &#34;He knew people would jump to conclusions about him,&#34; she says. &#34;He felt really violated. That&#39;s the day he completely stopped going into PKWare. He didn&#39;t want his personal life mixed in with his employees. Nobody really does.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他知道人们会得出关于他的结论，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;他觉得自己确实受到侵犯。那一天，他完全停止进入PKWare。他不希望自己的个人生活与员工混在一起。真的没有人。＆＃34;</p><p> By this time, Katz&#39;s closest acquaintances were the dancers at the strip bars he frequented.</p><p> 到这个时候，卡茨最亲密的熟人是他经常去的脱衣舞酒吧的舞者。 </p><p> Fischer says Katz showered her and other dancers with gifts, often taking groups of them with him to Las Vegas. Several of them accompanied him to the 1998 Comdex computer show there.</p><p>菲舍尔说，卡茨给她和其他舞者们送上了礼物，他们经常带着他们一起去拉斯维加斯。他们中的几个人陪着他参加了1998年的Comdex计算机展。</p><p> &#34;I would sleep with him in the same bed. He never would touch or sneak a peek or anything like that,&#34; she says. &#34;Sometimes he would cry and be like, &#39;Hold me, Chastity.&#39; You&#39;d just have to hold him all night long.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我会和他在同一张床上睡觉。他绝不会触摸或偷窥一眼或类似的东西，＆＃34;她说。有时他会哭泣，就像，抱紧我，贞洁。您只需要整晚抱住他。</p><p> &#34;There was never anything dirty about him,&#34; she says. &#34;He was not a pervert. I swear on my Bible. He was the most harmless, most generous, unselfish guy I have ever known.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他从来没有任何肮脏的东西，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;他不是一个变态。我在圣经上发誓。他是我所认识的最无害，最慷慨，无私的人。</p><p> Some of his stripper friends took advantage of his generosity, stealing his credit card numbers and buying things for themselves. It intensified his paranoia. Katz began to keep any receipt or piece of mail bearing his name or account numbers. He piled it all into the back of his 1991 Nissan Pathfinder.</p><p> 他的一些脱衣舞朋友利用了他的慷慨大度，偷走了他的信用卡号并自己买了东西。这加剧了他的偏执狂。卡茨开始保留任何带有他的名字或帐号的收据或邮件。他把这一切都塞进了1991年的日产探路者的背上。</p><p> &#34;That Pathfinder was so disgusting. It literally had no back seat,&#34; Fischer says. &#34;It was papers from the ground up.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;探路者是如此恶心。它实际上没有后座，＆＃34;菲舍尔说。 ＆＃34;是从头开始的论文。</p><p> Fearful of the arrest warrants, Katz kept on the move. In addition to the drunken-driving convictions, he had a half-dozen judgments against him from financial institutions totaling more than $30,000, court records show.</p><p> 由于担心逮捕令，Katz继续前进。法庭记录显示，除了醉酒驾驶罪名成立外，他还受到金融机构对他的六项判决，总额超过3万美元。</p><p> Katz hopscotched along a strip of hotels near Mitchell International Airport, staying at one for three or four days, then moving to the next, usually less than a few hundred yards away.</p><p> 卡茨沿着米切尔国际机场附近的一家旅馆跳来跳去，在一家旅馆住了三四天，然后又搬到下一家，通常不到几百码。 </p><p> &#34;You know what he did? He sat in his hotel room every single day,&#34; Fischer says. &#34;The only time he got out of the hotel room was maybe to go have dinner.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;你知道他做了什么吗？他每天都坐在旅馆房间里，＆＃34;菲舍尔说。 ＆＃34;他唯一离开酒店房间的时间可能是去吃晚饭。</p><p> Fischer says Katz sometimes called her answering machine late at night, pleading with her to join him. During their conversations, he sometimes spoke candidly about his family, his company, and his childhood, Fischer says.</p><p> 菲舍尔说，卡兹有时会在深夜打电话给她的答录机，恳求她加入。菲舍尔说，在他们的谈话中，他有时会坦率地谈论他的家人，他的公司和他的童年。</p><p> He said that his separation from his mother and sister was difficult, and that he continued to send Hildegard flowers and e-mails, even though they hadn&#39;t talked since he fired her from the company.</p><p> 他说，与母亲和妹妹的分离很困难，即使他自公司解雇她以来，他一直在给希尔德加送花和发送电子邮件，尽管他们一直没有说话。</p><p>  Fischer says he drank at least a liter of Rumple minze and two bottles of Bacardi rum a day.</p><p>  菲舍尔说，他每天至少喝一升Rumple薄荷糖和两瓶百加得朗姆酒。</p><p> &#34;He would drink until he&#39;d puke. We&#39;d have to see this. I never was with an alcoholic where you&#39;d have to see it. After a while it was starting to make us sick,&#34; Fischer says. &#34;We&#39;d say Phil, you know, this is sickening. You&#39;re killing yourself, and we&#39;re watching you do it.&#34;</p><p> 他会喝酒直到吐出来。我们必须看到这个。我从没和过酒鬼见过面。过了一会儿，它开始使我们生病，＆＃34;菲舍尔说。我们要说菲尔，这很令人恶心。您正在自杀，而我们正在看着您这样做。</p><p> Hildegard Katz says her son underwent treatment for alcohol abuse. &#34;We all tried to help. As with almost any alcoholic, the more you tell them to get some help, they begin to isolate themselves because they don&#39;t want to hear it,&#34; Hildegard says.</p><p> 希尔德加德·卡兹（Hildegard Katz）说，她的儿子因滥用酒精而接受了治疗。 ＆＃34;我们都试图提供帮助。与几乎所有酒精饮料一样，您告诉他们获得帮助的次数越多，他们就开始孤立自己，因为他们不想听，“希尔德加德说。</p><p>   Fischer says she realized Katz was near the end when she visited him at a south side hotel a few weeks before his death. Clad in nothing but underwear, he was suffering from uncontrollable hiccups and burdened by a horribly swollen stomach.</p><p>   菲舍尔说，卡兹去世前几周，她在卡兹（Katz）的南部一家旅馆探访卡兹时就意识到自己快要走了。他除了穿内衣外什么都没穿，他正遭受无法控制的打and，并承受着胃极肿胀的负担。 </p><p> &#34;He took some Valium so he could sleep. That was the only time he could sleep,&#34; she says. &#34;Then he would have the alcohol shakes. I&#39;d try to play computer games with him, but he&#39;d run to the bathroom all the time.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;他服用了一些Valium，以便可以入睡。那是他唯一可以睡觉的时间，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;然后他会摇酒。我试图和他一起玩电脑游戏，但他一直都在上厕所。</p><p> &#34;He was so bad to the point where he would start (urinating) in his pants involuntarily. His liver was just going. He was puking up blood,&#34; she says.</p><p> ＆＃34;他是如此糟糕，以至于他不由自主地开始（小便）在他的裤子里。他的肝脏刚好。他正在抽血，＆＃34;她说。</p><p>   Katz had been dead for two days before his body was found. PKWare employees learned of his death almost a week later.</p><p>   卡茨在被发现前已经死了两天。 PKWare员工将近一周后得知了他的死亡。</p><p> In the days that followed, the company was flooded with hundreds of e-mails offering condolences from software junkies around the world. Most had never met Katz but were aware of what he had done. Stories of his death were printed in such far-flung media as theLondon Times, the New York Times and abcnews.com.</p><p> 在随后的日子里，该公司充斥着数百封来自世界各地软件迷的电子邮件。大多数人从未见过卡茨，但知道他做了什么。他逝世的故事在伦敦时报，纽约时报和abcnews.com等广泛的媒体上发表。</p><p> But the sadness was deepest for those who had suffered the longest as Phil Katz&#39;s life came unglued. Hildegard had to make the sad trip to identify the son she hadn&#39;t seen in five years.</p><p> 但是对于那些因菲尔·卡茨（Phil Katz）的生活解脱而受苦时间最长的人来说，悲伤是最深的。希尔德加德（Hildegard）不得不艰难地旅行，以查明她五年来没有见过的儿子。</p><p>  &#34;I get the e-mails people are</p><p>  ＆＃34;我收到的电子邮件是</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000829071343/http://www2.jsonline.com/news/state/may00/katz21052000a.asp">https://web.archive.org/web/20000829071343/http://www2.jsonline.com/news/state/may00/katz21052000a.asp</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/计算机/">#计算机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/tormented/">#tormented</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/katz/">#katz</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
