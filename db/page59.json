Her remarks came during an exchange with Ben Flowers, Ohio\u2019s solicitor general, as he referred to  a brief filed by the American Commitment Foundation, which argued that the rise of the omicron variant had made the vaccine rules less relevant because vaccines do not appear especially effective against it.\n   (We will not address remarks made by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, which some readers also thought were wrong. The official court transcript  suggested he had made an inflated statement about the annual flu: \u201cFlu kills \u2014 I believe \u2014 hundreds of thousands of people every year.\u201d The flu kills between 12,000 and 52,000 people in the United States a year, but  the audio of the argument shows Gorsuch actually said that \u201cflu kills, I believe, hundreds, thousands of people every year.\u201d So the transcript is incorrect.)\n  The brief in question sought to update the court on latest scientific and technical information on the omicron variant, as that had emerged with force after the mandate was proposed. Epidemiologists  Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and  Andrew Bostom, who says he is affiliated with Brown University, helped advise on it.\n   Its key argument, citing data from countries such as South Africa and Denmark, was that omicron cases were 80 percent less likely to get hospitalized (South Africa) and three times less likely to end up with hospital admissions than the delta variant (Denmark). Moreover, the brief argued, the case fatality rate in South Africa plunged dramatically when omicron became dominant.\n  Flowers, who said he had been twice vaccinated and received a booster, participated remotely after testing positive for covid. His symptoms  were said to be \u201cexceptionally mild.\u201d\n \u201cMy presence here as a triple vaccinated individual by phone\u201d suggested \u201cvaccines do not appear to be very effective in stopping the spread or transmission,\u201d he said, though he added that vaccines are effective at preventing \u201csevere consequences.\u201d That\u2019s when Sotomayor interrupted him to assert \u201cthose numbers show that omicron is as deadly and causes as much serious disease in the unvaccinated as delta did.\u201d She argued that \u201csaying it\u2019s a different variant just underscores the fact\u201d a workplace rule was needed.\n   Actually, as we have shown, that\u2019s not what the brief said. In fact, it even argued that vaccinated individuals might be more likely to catch covid rather than unvaccinated individuals. (The brief refers mainly to people with two vaccine doses as \u201cvaccinated,\u201d not people who also received a booster.) The brief suggests \u201cthis may be because unvaccinated, covid-recovered patients have better protection versus omicron than vaccinated patients who never previously had covid.\u201d\n Nevertheless, the spike in cases has led to increased hospitalizations, Sotomayor noted during the exchange. Almost 30 percent of intensive-care beds are filled with covid patients as of Jan. 8,  according the Health and Human Services Department data.\n But then Sotomayor went off the rails: \u201cWe have over 100,000 children, which we\u2019ve never had before, in serious condition and many on ventilators.\u201d\n   That\u2019s wildly incorrect, assuming she is referring to hospitalizations, given the reference to ventilators.  According to HHS data, as of Jan. 8 there are about 5,000 children hospitalized in a pediatric bed, either with suspected covid or a confirmed laboratory test. This figure includes patients in observation beds. So Sotomayor\u2019s number is at least 20 times higher than reality, even before you determine how many are in \u201cserious condition.\u201d\n Moreover,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been less than 100,000 \u2014 82,843 to be exact \u2014 hospital admissions of children confirmed with covid since Aug. 1, 2020.\n Still, the current seven-day average (Dec. 30-Jan. 5) is 797, which is a sharp increase from the week before (441) and represents the peak seven-day average for children, the CDC said. So Sotomayor is not wrong to suggest the rate of pediatric admissions is cause for concern. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics  reported a sharp rise in pediatric cases, with many of the children unvaccinated. (Some children are hospitalized for other reasons and then test positive for covid through screenings at the hospital.)\n     It\u2019s important for Supreme Court justices to make rulings based on correct data. There has been a spike in pediatric cases with covid, even if the omicron variant appears less deadly. But Sotomayor during an oral argument offered a figure \u2014 100,000 children in \u201cserious condition \u2026 many on ventilators\u201d \u2014 that is absurdly high.

In the past year, both countries have enacted rules compelling gig companies to provide more worker protections to drivers.\n \u201cSpain business is up close to 40 percent on a year-on-year basis, and Spain EBITDA margins are very close to our overall long-term margins as well,\u201d noted Khosrowshahi, referencing the company\u2019s cash flow before taxes and interest.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of demand for our technology, our service, our brand, our safety, our reliability. So any model can work economically for us,\u201d he added.\n  The Uber CEO\u2019s nonchalant remarks appear to contradict the company\u2019s stance in the United States.\n The classification of gig economy drivers has become one of the most contentious modern labor industry issues\u00a0in the U.S., where an estimated 59 million total gig workers labor without benefits, guaranteed hours, or the protection of a union. Uber has been a leading force in preserving this gig structure, pouring over $190 million into a ballot measure in California alone to reverse rules that granted most drivers employee status. The regulations, passed by the California State Assembly in 2019 as Assembly Bill 5, or A.B. 5, aimed to make these workers eligible for minimum wage, union membership, and health care benefits.\n In 2020, as gig companies fought the law in California courts, Khosrowshahi  floated the possibility of temporarily suspending services in the entire state. The law has now been partially repealed, keeping the ride-hailing and delivery drivers it was designed to convert classified as independent contractors.\n Uber\u00a0has\u00a0preserved its focus on maintaining this classification in every market in which it operates. The company is currently\u00a0spending millions of dollars\u00a0on advocacy to enshrine independent contractor status laws for drivers in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and  other states that have considered gig labor reform.\n Employer costs for employee benefits tend to be higher in the U.S. than in Europe, given the U.S. system of employer-provided health coverage. In many European states, the government provides health benefits and directly limits health care costs.\n But the political environment is different across the Atlantic in many other ways. Despite a string of lobbying victories in the U.S. around the driver classification issue, the tides have recently turned\u00a0in Europe, where the courts and elected officials are more aligned with labor interests.\n Last August, Spain enacted the \u201cRider Law,\u201d which requires gig food delivery companies to classify drivers as employees. Uber  lashed out in response, claiming that such rules \u201cdirectly hurt thousands of couriers who use food delivery apps for much-needed flexible earnings opportunities and made it clear they do not want to be classified as employees.\u201d\n Like in the U.S., independent contractors in Spain are not afforded a number of employer-provided benefits, such as paid leave, and are excluded from joining unions or collective bargaining agreements. Under the new law, Just Eat, Europe\u2019s largest gig economy food delivery platform, signed a contract with Spanish unions CCOO\u00a0and UGT for a higher hourly rate, extended vacation, a maximum working day of nine hours, and other protections. Uber Eats, however, responded by hiring a fleet of drivers through third-party employment agencies, an arrangement that helps the California-based firm avoid direct management of its drivers while complying with the Spanish labor law.\n In the U.K., courts ruled last year that Uber must classify 70,000 drivers as \u201cworkers.\u201d The worker classification, a technical distinction from either an independent contractor or employee under British labor law, allows drivers to receive a minimum wage, vacation time, and access to a pension plan.\n In the wake of the U.K. decision, Khosrowshahi\u00a0 published\u00a0an opinion column pledging to respect the ruling and treat drivers as workers. \u201cFollowing last month\u2019s UK Supreme Court ruling, we could have continued to dispute drivers\u2019 rights to any of these protections in court. Instead, we have decided to turn the page. Beginning today, Uber drivers in the UK will be treated as workers,\u201d\u00a0 Khosrowshahi wrote.\n  The series of defeats for Uber\u2019s management could roll into a much larger setback, as the\u00a0EU is now considering federation-wide adoption of Spain\u2019s gig economy law. The European Trade Union Confederation said that the EU \u201cmust\u201d follow Spain\u2019s lead and adopt a similar law, a push that is growing\u00a0in the European Parliament.\n While conceding defeat in the U.K., Uber has continued to oppose Spain\u2019s Rider Law and has employed lobbyists in Brussels to prevent a similar statute from being enacted across the EU. By revealing Uber\u2019s continued business success in Spain despite the enhanced worker protections, last month\u2019s investor call belies the company\u2019s advocacy.\n Asked for comment about Khosrowshahi\u2019s apparent reversal, Uber emphasized its focus on treating drivers as independent contractors.\n \u201cPoll after poll shows that drivers overwhelmingly want to remain independent contractors and work where and when they want \u2014 but they also deserve more protections,\u201d wrote Uber spokesperson Noah Edwardsen in an email to The Intercept.\n \u201cIn Europe, Accenture, Good Work, Oxford Economics and the latest studies from Copenhagen Economics (based on a survey of 16k European couriers) as well as Compass Lexecon make it clear the #1 reason people access platform work is for flexibility to earn money while balancing other commitments, and would prefer to remain independent. This is why we believe the best answer is to provide new benefits, while ensuring drivers and couriers keep the flexibility they value,\u201d Edwardsen continued.\n But labor advocates see a company that is merely forced to comply with the rules\u00a0and will stop at nothing to maximize profit for executives and shareholders.\n \u201cUber has always said it couldn\u2019t adapt to an employee model that afforded its drivers fundamental protections in law like a minimum wage and the right to form a union,\u201d wrote Steve Smith, a spokesperson for the California Labor Federation, in a statement to The Intercept.\n \u201cDara Khosrowshahi\u2019s acknowledgement that the company can\u00a0\u2014 and has\u00a0\u2014 adapted to treating workers as employees in other countries is a slap in the face to every single driver in the US that Uber continues to exploit,\u201d Smith added. \u201cIt boils down to pure greed of wealthy executives who will do anything in their power to lock workers out of having a share of the profits their labor creates.\u201d\n Wait!

(La Famiglia and 468 Capital are repeat backers of Munich-based Arive, both having invested in the seed round for the company, which is not to be confused with the  mortgage startup of the same name in the U.S.)\n Arive\u2019s funding, and list of backers, is notable in that it\u2019s based on a pretty limited run so far. The startup launched only four months ago and is currently active in just four cities in Germany \u2014 Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt \u2014 although now the idea will be to use the investment to expand further across the country and to start considering which other markets to tackle next.\n  The reason for the vote of confidence is that so far, the numbers look promising. Arive is not disclosing how many customers it has or what its revenues are looking like, but it notes that the average order size is between \u20ac50 and \u20ac100 ($56 and $113) across some 1,000 SKUs, with the average basket containing between one and four items. That presents what Arive is doing as a very different proposition to what, say, a GoPuff or Getir is hoping to achieve with its instant delivery model, essentially replacing the weekly grocery shop with multiple baskets delivered to one\u2019s door.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being the next quick commerce vertical but building the next generation of e-commerce,\u201d said Maximilian Reeker, who co-founded Arive with Linus Fries (the two co-lead the company). He described that next generation like this: \u201cVery convenient delivery of between 30 and 60 minutes, connecting people to local stores with a bike-based service, in an app optimized for the phone.\u201d All of its couriers are employed by the company, either full-time or part-time.\n Arive has up to now split the model into three parts, providing consignment, wholesale and, in the next 2-3 months, marketplace options for sourcing supply. Fries said that currently the wholesale part accounts for the largest part of its business and sales.\n Beyond that, white label services \u2014 where Arive might sell its backend technology and delivery infrastructure to third-party retailers to build their own instant delivery services \u2014 is another area that the company is considering, Fries said. This could be a very interesting opportunity in areas such as fashion: typically online sales of clothes have been challenged by issues of sizing and dealing with returns, which make for a high barrier of entry for a company like Arive without making extensive and focused investments to address them. What it could do, however, is provide its technology to fashion brands and retailers that have, who are considering ways of getting apparel faster to would-be online buyers.\n  Meanwhile, although it\u2019s taking a different approach in instant delivery by eschewing groceries and  FMCG essentials and focusing on higher-ticket slower-moving consumer goods, Arive is still operating very much with those grocery delivery startups in mind for another reason.\n Reeker told me that Arive actually relishes the oversupply of these startups in certain markets \u2014 indeed, the bubble has definitely started to burst for some of these startups, as they get  snapped up by much larger and highly capitalized rivals looking to expand to new geographies \u2014 because they become a signal for where Arive should be considering to expand to next.\n \u201cWe want to go to more places in Germany and expand internationally, and while we haven\u2019t decided which cities, we looking at those where existing grocery plays are live,\u201d said Reeker. \u201cThe UK, France, they are all interesting. Having those grocery companies there is an advantage for us because it\u2019s evidence of the consumer shift that has taken place. They are already used to getting their food quickly, which is the first step.\u201d\n Arive is not the first company to have thought of building a service around instant delivery of virtually any kind of item a person might like to have without leaving their homes to buy it. This was basically the premise behind Amazon Prime Now, which the e-commerce giant launched the service in  2014. Pointedly, although Amazon expanded it to several markets, eventually it  discontinued the standalone app and branding it had built for Prime Now, which now exists as a faster-delivery option for some of the items that it sells via Prime.\n The message there could be interpreted in two ways. It could point to challenges for scaling something like a fast-delivery service without also providing a wider range of options that offer cheaper options and longer delivery times to customers put off by the premium that comes with instant.\n Or, it could point to how there remains an opportunity for a smaller and more focused company to get the model right, understanding that the market has matured in the last eight years and consumers are not only more willing to shop online than ever before due to Covid-19, but have focused their expectations of how that experience should more closely mirror the instant-gratification of shopping in person.\n Investors are willing to bet that the two co-founders \u2014 which hatched the idea of Arive while at business school \u2014 have a shot in building something fit the latter of those.\n \u201cLinus, Max, and the entire team at arive are challenging e-commerce conventions with energetic execution and an acute sensitivity to the priorities of modern brands,\u201d said Colin Hanna, partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. \u201cUsing light electric vehicles to rapidly fulfill orders leaves a lighter footprint on our planet and ensures that customers are home to receive goods they\u2019ve purchased online, avoiding costly failed deliveries. The team is also committed to building their UX in a way that protects, rather than erodes, the value of the brands they are lucky to work with. Finally, high basket sizes and no wastage means the company has a much stronger path to a sustainable business model over the long run.\u00a0 Balderton is fortunate to be backing arive as it scales rapidly across Europe.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 19:38:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u670d\u52a1,delivery", "title": "\u5728\u6742\u8d27\u548c\u5fc5\u9700\u54c1\u8d85\u8d8a\u6742\u8d27\u548c\u5fc5\u9700\u54c1\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u9001\u8d27\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5448\u73b020\u7c73", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tArive raises $20M for an instant delivery service beyond groceries and essentials\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/arive-raises-20m-for-an-instant-delivery-service-beyond-groceries-and-essentials/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u670d\u52a1", "delivery"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072609, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u60a8\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u90fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5362\u7279\u5170\u6c34\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u50a8\u5907\u56e2\u961f\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u53e4\u7eff\u8bed\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u751f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5929\u3002", "note_en": "Every day is different when you work on a nature reserve, but nothing could have prepared our reserves team at Rutland Water Nature Reserve for the day when they made the palaeontological discovery of a lifetime.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 19:27:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82f1\u56fd,largest,\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a", "title": "\u82f1\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u201c\u6d77\u9f99\u201d\u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u53bf\u53d1\u73b0", "title_en": "Britain's largest 'Sea Dragon' discovered in UK's smallest county", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.lrwt.org.uk/seadragon", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f1\u56fd", "largest", "\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "99b914602dae1449ee970d836ee480ad.jpeg", "infoid": 1072608, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd1\u4e24\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709 - \u65b0\u95fb\u754c\u548c\u4eba\u53e3 - \u5f53\u5c40\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u51e0\u4e4e\u50ac\u7720\u3002\n\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u503c\u5f97\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u201d\u4e00\u8bcd\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u533b\u9662\u8fd8\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u90fd\u662f\u3002\u4f46\u6f6e\u529b\u4eba\u58eb\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u901a\u5e38\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u201d\u4e00\u8bcd\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\u3002", "note_en": "I N\u00c6STEN\u00a0to \u00e5r har vi \u2013 pressen og\u00a0befolkningen \u2013 v\u00e6ret n\u00e6rmest hypnotisk optagede af myndighedernes daglige coronatal.\n VI HAR STIRRET\u00a0p\u00e5 tal-pendulets svingninger, n\u00e5r det gjaldt smittede, indlagte og d\u00f8de med corona.

It emerged that he was not a member of the organisation and he has never been charged with involvement in 9/11.\n For much of the time since his arrest, Zubaydah has been held incommunicado, at the insistence of the CIA as part of its efforts to prevent details of his torture from becoming public.\n Lawyers for Zubaydah believe it is highly unlikely that  Lithuania would have made the compensation payment without approval from Washington.\n \u201cThe situation is a lot less incommunicado when you pay \u20ac100,000 to someone and the whole world knows about it,\u201d Mark Denbeaux, one of Zubaydah\u2019s legal team based in the US, told the Guardian.\n  \u201cThis move is consistent with the idea that the US is softening its position on the detention of the forever prisoners. The US could clearly have kept Lithuania from handing over this money and the question is, why didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n News of the Lithuanian payment comes just days before the 20th anniversary of the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo, which  received its first detainees on 11 January 2002. In recent months there have been other signs of a shifting attitude towards Zubaydah and the torture that was inflicted upon him by CIA agents and contractors.\n In October, the US supreme court  heard arguments in a case in which the US government is seeking to block two CIA contractors from testifying in Poland about torture Zubaydah suffered in 2002 and 2003 at a secret or \u201cblack\u201d site in that country. In the course of the hearing, several of the justices, including conservatives, broke a legal taboo by  openly using the word \u201ctorture\u201d.\n In Zubaydah\u2019s case against Lithuania, which was led on the European side by his lawyer Helen Duffy, the European Court of Human Rights  heard that Zubaydah was held at a CIA black site in that country from February 2005 to March 2006. The site, codenamed Violet, was on the outskirts of Vilnius.\n The most brutal forms of torture endured by Zubaydah occurred in 2002 when he was held at a CIA black site in Thailand. An entire program of torture, euphemistically referred to by the CIA as \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d, was devised for the prisoner by two psychologists under contract to the agency.\n  Zubaydah was waterboarded \u2013 a type of controlled drowning \u2013 at least 83 times in August 2002, as well as being placed in a coffin-sized box for days on end.\n European judges heard that Zubaydah was unlikely to have suffered from the harshest forms of torture while in Lithuania. But he was subjected to techniques that still amounted to torture, lawyers argued, including sensory and sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, loud noise and harsh light.\n The money transferred by Lithuania is now in a bank account. Zubaydah is unable to receive the sum given his detention in Guant\u00e1namo and because his assets have been frozen by the US treasury.\n A similar freezing of his assets by the United Nations security council was reversed two years ago, after a petition by his lawyers.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 19:24:22", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "abu,pays,zubaydah", "title": "\u7acb\u9676\u5b9b\u652f\u4ed8Guanter\u00e1namo\u6c38\u8fdc\u56da\u72afAbu Zubaydah\u20ac100000\u5728CIA\u9177\u5211", "title_en": "Lithuania pays Guant\u00e1namo forever prisoner Abu Zubaydah \u20ac100000 over CIA torture", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/lithuania-pays-guantanamo-forever-prisoner-abu-zubaydah-100000-cia-torture", "via": "", "real_tags": ["abu", "pays", "zubaydah"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072605, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211Saac Newton Apocryphally\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5f8b - \u5173\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a - \u5728\u82f9\u679c\u6454\u5012\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u8111\u888b\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\u7a0d\u540e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ed6\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u4e86\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4ed6\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb - \u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0cf = ma  - \u5e76\u7528\u5b83\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u82f9\u679c\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff08\u5982\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u8db3\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u7a0d\u540e\u7684\u4eba\uff09\u3002\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u65e0\u7406\u8bba\u79d1\u5b66\u6765\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u8212\u670d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u5904\u7406\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50 - \u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\n\u666e\u6797\u65af\u987f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5ef6\u4f38\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u662f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4ed6\u4eec\u63ed\u793a\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5c11 - \u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9ad8\u6f6e\u662fFacebook\u6216alphafold\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u65e0\u8bba\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u3002\nAi Sumit Chopra\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u591a\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e - \u56e0\u6b64\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4 - \u4ea7\u751f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u57f9\u8badAI\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8f83\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662fChopra\u7684\u7ec4\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u4f46\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u4ecd\u7136\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u8212\u9002\u5730\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u773c\u775b\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u76842D\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002", "note_en": "I saac Newton apocryphally discovered his second law \u2013 the one about gravity \u2013 after an apple fell on his head. Much experimentation and data analysis later, he realised there was a fundamental relationship between force, mass and acceleration. He formulated a theory to describe that relationship \u2013 one that could be expressed as an equation, F=ma \u2013 and used it to predict the behaviour of objects other than apples. His predictions turned out to be right (if not always precise enough for those who came later).\n Contrast how science is increasingly done today. Facebook\u2019s  machine learning tools predict your preferences better than any psychologist. AlphaFold, a program built by DeepMind, has produced the most  accurate predictions yet of protein structures based on the amino acids they contain. Both are completely silent on why they work: why you prefer this or that information; why this sequence generates that structure.\n   You can\u2019t lift a curtain and peer into the mechanism. They offer up no explanation, no set of rules for converting this into that \u2013 no theory, in a word. They just work and do so well. We witness the social effects of Facebook\u2019s predictions daily. AlphaFold has yet to make its impact felt, but  many are convinced it will change medicine.\n Somewhere between Newton and Mark Zuckerberg, theory took a back seat. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the then editor-in-chief of  Wired magazine,  predicted its demise. So much data had accumulated, he argued, and computers were already so much better than us at finding relationships within it, that our theories were being exposed for what they were \u2013 oversimplifications of reality. Soon, the old scientific method \u2013 hypothesise, predict, test \u2013 would be relegated to the dustbin of history. We\u2019d stop looking for the causes of things and be satisfied with correlations.\n  With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that what Anderson saw is true (he wasn\u2019t alone). The complexity that this wealth of data has revealed to us cannot be captured by theory as traditionally understood. \u201cWe have leapfrogged over our ability to even write the theories that are going to be useful for description,\u201d says computational neuroscientist Peter Dayan, director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what they would look like.\u201d\n But Anderson\u2019s prediction of the end of theory looks to have been premature \u2013 or maybe his thesis was itself an oversimplification. There are several reasons why theory refuses to die, despite the successes of such theory-free prediction engines as  Facebook and AlphaFold. All are illuminating, because they force us to ask: what\u2019s the best way to acquire knowledge and where does science go from here?\n The first reason is that we\u2019ve realised that artificial intelligences (AIs), particularly a form of machine learning called neural networks, which learn from data without having to be fed explicit instructions, are themselves fallible. Think of the prejudice that has been documented in  Google\u2019s search engines and  Amazon\u2019s hiring tools.\n The second is that humans turn out to be deeply uncomfortable with theory-free science. We don\u2019t like dealing with a black box \u2013 we want to know  why.\n And third, there may still be plenty of theory of the traditional kind \u2013 that is, graspable by humans \u2013 that usefully explains much but has yet to be uncovered.\n So theory isn\u2019t dead, yet, but it is changing \u2013 perhaps beyond recognition. \u201cThe theories that make sense when you have huge amounts of data look quite different from those that make sense when you have small amounts,\u201d says Tom Griffiths, a psychologist at Princeton University.\n Griffiths has been using neural nets to help him improve on existing theories in his domain, which is human decision-making. A popular theory of how people make decisions when economic risk is involved is prospect theory, which was formulated by behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s (it later won Kahneman a Nobel prize). The idea at its core is that people are sometimes, but not always, rational.\n  In  Science last June,  Griffiths\u2019s group described how they trained a neural net on a vast dataset of decisions people took in 10,000 risky choice scenarios, then compared how accurately it predicted further decisions with respect to prospect theory. They found that prospect theory did pretty well, but the neural net showed its worth in highlighting where the theory broke down, that is, where its predictions failed.\n These counter-examples were highly informative, Griffiths says, because they revealed more of the complexity that exists in real life. For example, humans are constantly weighing up probabilities based on incoming information, as prospect theory describes. But when there are too many competing probabilities for the brain to compute, they might switch to a different strategy \u2013 being guided by a rule of thumb, say \u2013 and a stockbroker\u2019s rule of thumb might not be the same as that of a teenage  bitcoin trader, since it is drawn from different experiences.\n \u201cWe\u2019re basically using the machine learning system to identify those cases where we\u2019re seeing something that\u2019s inconsistent with our theory,\u201d Griffiths says. The bigger the dataset, the more inconsistencies the AI learns. The end result is not a theory in the traditional sense of a precise claim about how people make decisions, but a set of claims that is subject to certain constraints. A way to picture it might be as a branching tree of \u201cif\u2026 then\u201d-type rules, which is difficult to describe mathematically, let alone in words.\n  What the Princeton psychologists are discovering is still just about explainable, by extension from existing theories. But as they reveal more and more complexity, it will become less so \u2013 the logical culmination of that process being the theory-free predictive engines embodied by Facebook or AlphaFold.\n Some scientists are comfortable with that, even eager for it. When voice recognition software pioneer Frederick Jelinek said: \u201cEvery time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recogniser goes up,\u201d he meant that theory was holding back progress \u2013 and that was in the 1980s.\n Or take protein structures. A protein\u2019s function is largely determined by its structure, so if you want to design a drug that blocks or enhances a given protein\u2019s action, you need to know its structure. AlphaFold was trained on structures that were derived experimentally, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and at the moment its predictions are considered more reliable for proteins where there is some experimental data available than for those where there is none. But its reliability is improving all the time, says Janet Thornton, former director of the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) near Cambridge, and it isn\u2019t the lack of a theory that will stop drug designers using it. \u201cWhat AlphaFold does is also discovery,\u201d she says, \u201cand it will only improve our understanding of life and therapeutics.\u201d\n  Others are distinctly less comfortable with where science is heading. Critics point out, for example, that neural nets can throw up spurious correlations, especially if the datasets they are trained on are small. And all datasets are biased, because scientists don\u2019t collect data evenly or neutrally, but always with certain hypotheses or assumptions in mind, assumptions that worked their way damagingly into Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s AIs. As philosopher of science Sabina Leonelli of the University of Exeter explains: \u201cThe data landscape we\u2019re using is incredibly skewed.\u201d\n But while these problems certainly exist, Dayan doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re insurmountable. He points out that humans are biased too and, unlike AIs, \u201cin ways that are very hard to interrogate or correct\u201d. Ultimately, if a theory produces less reliable predictions than an AI, it will be hard to argue that the machine is the more biased of the two.\n A tougher obstacle to the new science may be our human need to explain the world \u2013 to talk in terms of cause and effect. In 2019, neuroscientists Bingni Brunton and Michael Beyeler of the University of Washington, Seattle,  wrote that this need for interpretability may have prevented scientists from making novel insights about the brain, of the kind that only emerges from large datasets. But they also sympathised. If those insights are to be translated into useful things such as drugs and devices, they wrote, \u201cit is imperative that computational models yield insights that are explainable to, and trusted by, clinicians, end-users and industry\u201d.\n \u201c Explainable AI\u201d, which addresses how to bridge the interpretability gap, has become a hot topic. But that gap is only set to widen and we might instead be faced with a trade-off: how much predictability are we willing to give up for interpretability?\n Sumit Chopra, an AI scientist who thinks about the application of machine learning to healthcare at New York University, gives the example of an MRI image. It takes a lot of raw data \u2013 and hence scanning time \u2013 to produce such an image, which isn\u2019t necessarily the best use of that data if your goal is to accurately detect, say, cancer. You could train an AI to identify what smaller portion of the raw data is sufficient to produce an accurate diagnosis, as validated by other methods, and indeed Chopra\u2019s group has  done so. But radiologists and patients remain wedded to the image. \u201cWe humans are more comfortable with a 2D image that our eyes can interpret,\u201d he says.\n  The final objection to post-theory science is that there is likely to be useful old-style theory \u2013 that is, generalisations extracted from discrete examples \u2013 that remains to be discovered and only humans can do that because it requires intuition. In other words, it requires a kind of instinctive homing in on those properties of the examples that are relevant to the general rule. One reason we consider Newton brilliant is that in order to come up with his second law he had to ignore some data. He had to imagine, for example, that things were falling in a vacuum, free of the interfering effects of air resistance.\n In  Nature last month, mathematician Christian Stump, of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany,  called this intuitive step \u201cthe core of the creative process\u201d. But the reason he was writing about it was to say that for the first time, an AI had pulled it off. DeepMind had built a machine-learning program that had prompted mathematicians towards new insights \u2013 new generalisations \u2013 in the mathematics of knots.\n In 2022, therefore, there is almost no stage of the scientific process where AI hasn\u2019t left its footprint. And the more we draw it into our quest for knowledge, the more it changes that quest. We\u2019ll have to learn to live with that, but we can reassure ourselves about one thing: we\u2019re still asking the questions. As Pablo Picasso put it in the 1960s, \u201ccomputers are useless. They can only give you answers.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 19:22:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u76ee\u7779,dawn,\u9884\u6d4b", "title": "\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u76ee\u7779\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u540e\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u66d9\u5149\uff1f", "title_en": "Are we witnessing the dawn of post-theory science?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/09/are-we-witnessing-the-dawn-of-post-theory-science", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u76ee\u7779", "dawn", "\u9884\u6d4b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072604, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u56fd\u9632\u90e8\u7684\u4fdd\u969c\u63aa\u65bd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d70\u5f97\u5f97\u8db3\u591f\u8fdc\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e0a\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u7403\n1995\u5e74\u4fc4\u514b\u62c9\u8377\u9a6c\u57ce\u5e02\u8f70\u70b8\u9020\u6210168\u4eba\uff0c650\u591a\u4eba\u53d7\u4f24650\u5c81\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u4e00\u4efd\u65e9\u6668\u7684\u524d\u519b\u58eb\u5175\u8482\u83ab\u897f\u00b7\u9ea6\u514b\u98ce\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4eba\u6cf0\u79d1\u5c14\u65af\u505c\u653e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79df\u8d41\u5361\u8f66\uff0c\u91cc\u9762\u88c5\u6ee1\u4e86\u7f8e\u8054\u673a\u5916\u7684\u81ea\u5236\u70b8\u836f\u5e76\u5f15\u7206\u4e86\u3002\u5b83\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u6700\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u56fd\u5185\u6050\u6016\u4e3b\u4e49\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e24\u540d\u7537\u5b50\u9898\u8054\u53cd\u653f\u5e9c\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\n2018\u5e74\u6d77\u6d0b\u5170\u65af\u5170\u6c0f\u5170\u65af\u6cd5\u5229\u65af\u74e6\u897f\u5965\u00b7\u5df4\u65af\u6258\u65af\u57282017\u5e74\u590f\u6d1b\u65af\u7ef4\u5c14\u7684\u4eba\u6c11\u88ad\u51fb\u4eba\u6c11\u201c\u56e2\u7ed3\u201d\u53cd\u5f39\u4e4b\u540e\u88ab\u76d1\u7981\u3002\u5728\u5439\u725b\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6atomwaffen\u6210\u5458\u7684\u804a\u5929\u4e2d\u5439\u725b\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u624b\u67aa\u7684\u662fNeo-Nazi Group Atomwaffen\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\n\u201c\u4e25\u91cd\u5730\uff1f\u4f60\u60f3\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u5bb6\u4f19\u4e00\u8d77\u6563\u6b65\uff0ckkk\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff1f\u8fd9\u771f\u7684\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5417\uff1f\u201c\u4f0a\u987f\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u5458\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u5fc5\u987b\u9760\u8fd1\u5361\u7247\u643a\u5e26\u9a84\u50b2\u7684\u7537\u5b69\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d'3\u6708\u201d\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5b83\u3002\u201c\u4ed6\u52a0\u4e86\u3002\n\u91d1\u5320\u770b\u5230\u53cd\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\uff0c\u767d\u8272\u81f3\u9ad8\u65e0\u4e0a\u7684\u548c\u6cd5\u897f\u65af\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0e\u56fd\u5916\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u76f8\u540c\u3002 \u201c\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ade\u9009\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u5e26\u4ed6\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5708\uff0c\u201d\u91d1\u5320\u8bf4\u3002", "note_en": "Experts caution the defense department\u2019s safeguards don\u2019t go far enough and that \u2018we\u2019re behind the ball on what we know\u2019\n    Fears are growing among experts, politicians, and former generals about the rise of rightwing extremism in the  US military and the potential threat it could pose to American democracy.\n Even as the US Department of Defense issues new policies to root out extremism in its ranks, some experts caution that the safeguards don\u2019t go far enough, leaving the next election vulnerable to attack as well as fears about a broader violent \u201cinsurgency\u201d by rightwing radicals.\n   \u201cWe\u2019re behind the ball on what we know about domestic terrorists in the United States,\u201d Paul Eaton, a retired US army major general and senior adviser to the non-profit VoteVets, said.\n Eaton and two other retired army generals recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post last month warning of the threat of a coup in the 2024 election. The generals warned that it could succeed with the aid of rogue military elements. They contemplated the possibility of a breakdown of the chain of command, along partisan lines, in the aftermath of a contested election with \u201crogue units organizing among themselves to support the \u2018rightful\u2019 commander in chief\u201d.\n Eaton said in an interview that the American military and law enforcement have a history of underestimating the threat from the far right.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the Timothy McVeigh problem: what did we know about McVeigh and what were we doing about it?\u201d said Eaton.\n The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured over 650 when one morning ex-army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols parked a rental truck filled with homemade explosives outside a federal building and detonated it. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The two men harbored anti-government and racists beliefs.\n \u201cThe McVeighs of the world are still there, we had about 4,500 of them crawling all over the nation\u2019s capitol [during the 6 January attack],\u201d said Eaton, who added that the increased power of the internet and rise of social media had boosted the threat massively since McVeigh\u2019s attack.\n  \u201cThe infection of extremism into our state and local police and our armed forces is a very serious concern that needs to be monitored,\u201d said Eaton.\n Eaton added: \u201cThere\u2019s a recruiting effort going on locally, they\u2019re going to school boards, like missionaries sent to the islands to convert people. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are definitely recruiting.\u201d\u201d\n In many ways the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC laid bare the vulnerability of US service members to extremism. The  727 defendants charged in the 6 January Capitol riot include  81 with ties to the military, while five were active duty service members. A 35-year-old woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot while attempting to break the doors into the House chamber.\n The appeal of extremism among active duty and veterans is a longstanding issue with a track record of violent incidents.\n Last year army  private Ethan Phelan Melzer confessed to prosecutors in the southern district of New York to plotting an attack on fellow soldiers in his unit. The federal indictment states that Melzer confessed to sharing sensitive information about his soon-to-deploy unit with members of a neo-Nazi group in order to facilitate an attack that would \u201cresult in the deaths of as many of his fellow service members as possible\u201d.\n In 2018 marine lance corporal Vasillios Pistolis was imprisoned after assaulting people at the 2017 Charlottesville \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally. Pistolis was discovered to belong the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen after bragging about violence in  chats with other Atomwaffen members, which were eventually leaked.\n From 1990 to July 2021 there have been at least 354 people with military backgrounds that have committed criminal acts motivated by \u201cpolitical, economic, social, or religious goals\u201d according to data collected by  the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.\n The data suggest the problem is growing in the US as from 1990-2010 there was an average of six cases a year, but over the last decade \u201cthat number has more than tripled to nearly 21 subjects per year\u201d.\n  The generals\u2019 public call for elections safeguards in the military comes as the Pentagon issued new guidelines aimed at rooting out extremism in its ranks. The defense chief, Lloyd Austin, ordered a 60-day \u201cstand down\u201d early last year to come up with rules to stomp out extremism among the military\u2019s various branches. The new rules adopted by the Pentagon last month specify that service members are prohibited from engaging in extremist activities and could face disciplinary action for even \u201cliking\u201d extremist content on social media.\n The new guidance specifies that commanders must not be \u201cindifferent\u201d and hold service members who participate in extremist activity accountable. The Pentagon defines extremism as advocacy for violence to achieve goals that are \u201cpolitical, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature\u201d. It includes efforts to overthrow the government and advocating widespread unlawful discrimination \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation\u201d.\n Bu the Pentagon\u2019s effort towards stomping out extremism in the military may not go far enough. An  Associated Press investigation found the new guidelines fail to account for racism among the ranks, membership in groups such as the KKK, and longstanding racial disparities in military justice.\n The new guidelines don\u2019t prohibit membership in extremist groups like the KKK as long as they are not \u201cactively participating\u201d. The new rules attempt to police acts rather than associations or beliefs. Some former military figures say it\u2019s absurd to allow service members to also be members of violent extremist groups.\n \u201cSeriously? You want to be in a foxhole with a guy whose a member of the KKK? Is that really what we want to do here?\u201d said Eaton. \u201cThe idea of service members having to be in close proximity to card carrying members of the Proud Boys, as long as they don\u2019t \u2018march\u2019, that just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d he added.\n Some experts also criticize the approach as ignoring the very real threat of white supremacists. \u201cIt reflects the institutional bias that permeates all of our government, that even calling out white supremacy is politically fraught,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI special agent and current Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n German is concerned the classification has the potential for unintended consequences. \u201cIt opens the door to a strange political \u2018both sides-ism\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequence is that somebody expressing anti-racism can be seen as an extremist under that description.\u201d\n Experts see the far-right and other extremists as actively trying to recruit members of the military, including foreign agents seeking to promote disruption within the US.\n \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an insurgency in the Untied States,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and researcher.\n In a 200-page report published by Vietnam Veterans of America, Goldsmith found that between 2017 and 2019 foreign entities, such as Russian hackers, \u201ccoordinated online targeting of American service members, veterans, and their families\u201d in an effort to disrupt American democracy.\n \u201cWe found 10 different ways foreign entities were targeting veterans online,\u201d said Goldsmith, including through ads, fake veteran accounts that sent friend request to other veterans in order to penetrate the \u201crelatively small community of veteran advocates, and found large social media pages run by foreign admins that spread disinflation tailored to veterans in a effort to influence the election\u201d.\n Goldsmith sees anti-democratic, white supremacist and fascists movements targeting veterans for the same reason as foreign adversaries. \u201cVeterans are an economically efficient target for campaigns, because if you get one, they often bring their immediate social circle with them,\u201d said Goldsmith.\n Goldsmith warns that the coming election is vulnerable to a rising insurgency. \u201cWe saw a violent insurrection, we did not experience a peaceful transfer of power.

You will most definitely learn how to get your first client but if you\u2019re looking for a get rich quick scheme while you work in your underwear, please hit back on your browser.\n I promise you, if you take action on what you read in this article you could potentially have your first client tomorrow without spending a penny.\n  So, you\u2019ve recently decided that you want to take a shot at doing freelance or consulting work. That\u2019s great, and in this article I\u2019m going to give you a few tips on how to find your first freelance client but before that, you need to figure out what type of freelance worker you want to be.\n What I mean by that is, how much time are you looking to invest into freelancing? Are you looking to do it full time to replace a standard 9-5 job or as a side gig to create some extra income on the side?\n There is a very big difference between needing a check to pay rent when freelancing is your only source of income vs hoping to get some extra cash this month to either invest, enjoy life or help you climb out of debt just a little bit faster.\n Take some time to figure that out. For me, I use consulting as another revenue stream. As of this article, most of my income comes from a mixture of doing consulting work and selling software developer related courses but it wasn\u2019t always like that.\n Before I decided to create courses, it was all about freelancing and consulting for me. I made a lot of mistakes and left a ton of money on the table, so now I\u2019d like to write about how you can avoid those mistakes and start your business off on the right foot.\n   You might hear a lot of people say,  \u201coh you need a portfolio website and business cards before you can do anything, so step one is to do that!\u201d.\n Don\u2019t listen to them, you\u2019re going to waste money and time. This is just a  procrastination tactic. It\u2019s busy work that delays you from actually getting clients and making money.\n While I do think having a personal brand is important, I don\u2019t think having a portfolio site is all that important. I didn\u2019t even launch my own site until recently and if you look around, you won\u2019t find a portfolio of prior work. At most you\u2019ll find a few testimonials.\n That sounds almost impossible right? How could you possibly get clients without having a site, or a strong web presence. Simple, it comes down to how you find your clients.\n Trust me, no one is going to Google \u201cfind developer freelancer in NY\u201d and then find you. That\u2019s not how it works. You need to reach out to people, and the people you reach out to won\u2019t care about your portfolio.\n They care about how much value you add to their life. This could be how you can help them solve a problem, or make them money. They don\u2019t care that 2 years ago you put up a site for Acme Incorporated.\n   As a self taught programmer who didn\u2019t goto university, I missed out on a lot of opportunities to network with peers. So my first tip to you is, if you\u2019re at university right now, you should make a very conscious effort to build up a network of friends who have similar goals as you.\n You might be thinking  \u201cNick, how is my awkward programming wizard buddy going to help me land a freelance client?\u201d.\n You never know what will happen in the future. Maybe you graduate as close friends and 3 months later he calls you because he needs your expertise or is overwhelmed by work. Congrats, you just got a new client.\n But it gets much better. Each person you add to your network expands your overall reach exponentially. I\u2019ve had strings of freelance gigs for years that originated from a single connection.\n Person A may reach out to you to complete a job, and if you do a good job then person A may refer you to his friend for another job. The next thing you know, you\u2019re doing another job for a friend of a friend, all while the original people in your network continue to provide you opportunities.\n This is how real life works, and you often see this happen in other trade skills like plumbing and electricians. I know a few people in this field and they all have a network of friends who fill in skill gaps and cover for each other when they are unable to fulfill work due to time issues or other reasons.\n When they run into a job that requires a skill they don\u2019t have, they are not reaching for Google to find someone. They are going straight to their network of friends.\n I do the same exact thing too. In case you couldn\u2019t tell by my blog post images (I make / arrange almost all of them myself), I\u2019m not an artist, but when I need \u201cserious business\u201d custom graphics made I reach to my inner circle of friends and associates.\n The world outside of my personal network never gets a chance to even see the job opening.\n   Think about it from your POV as someone who works as a freelancer on sites like e-lance or upwork. We just finished talking about networks and how people tend to form circles of trust where they share jobs with each other.\n That typically means only the shitty jobs are available outside of these circles, and even worse they are jobs being managed by someone who might be difficult to work with. Not all people who hire freelancers on these sites are bad but in my experience, more often than not they end up being bad clients.\n They are the type of clients who will lurch over your shoulder, watching every move you make and ensure they pay the absolute minimum while demanding top tier results.\n Hell, even some of these platforms mandate that you keep an app running that randomly takes screenshots of your desktop to make sure you\u2019re working, so that your hourly quotes are \u201caccurate\u201d.\n  Sure, a mechanic has a book that they can reference to for guaranteed prices. They will guarantee that to get your tires rotated it will cost XYZ amount and take XYZ minutes.\n However, a skilled mechanic will be able to do it in half the time, so he\u2019s rewarded due to being able to rotate more tires per day than an unskilled mechanic. It\u2019s a win / win. The mechanic makes more money per day and you get your car back faster.\n This type of cost guarantee proves that the service being done is so well known and discovered that it\u2019s a commodity. It won\u2019t be long until robots can perform those steps exactly, with an efficiency that crushes even the best mechanic.\n However, the skilled mechanic won\u2019t be out of a job. He\u2019ll be first in line to buy one of those robots because the \u201cskill factor\u201d is not so much rotating the tires, but figuring out that they need rotating in the first place.\n Freelance platforms who spy on you by invading your privacy do nothing but punish you for being skilled.\n In what world should you make less money for being an expert at your craft?\n I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s the world driven by freelance platforms that exploit workers by putting them into some type of passive fear driven mindset. If you really think about it, it\u2019s insane.\n  \u201cI should spend a large portion of my life to become an expert in my craft, and then I should agree to have my privacy stripped away from me while I race to the bottom and undercut my competition because I will actively place myself into situations where I have the highest competition to ensure I receive the lowest rates. Lastly, I will bust my butt and bend the world to satisfy clients who take advantage of me.\u201d\n Sadly when you sign up to these sites, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying. To add insult to injury, they also take a chunk of your income. If you ask me, they are comparable to  Dante\u2019s 9 circles of Hell.\n My recommendation is to stay away from these sites at all costs. You\u2019re just going to get jaded early on by crappy clients and think that freelancing is too depressing to get into.\n   Instead of depending on freelance platforms, you should go and explore the world. I know, it\u2019s scary. I\u2019m \u201cintroverted\u201d too (whatever the hell that\u2019s supposed to mean), but you\u2019re allowed to step outside of your comfort zone, and trust me, the reward is worth it.\n Take action and build up your own personal network using any strategy you can think of. It\u2019s ok if you spend all day (or longer) thinking of ways to do this. That sure beats looking at WP themes for 7 hours for your \u201cportfolio site\u201d.\n  If you\u2019re at university, try connecting with as many of your fellow students as possible. Don\u2019t be lazy, because you\u2019re in an excellent position right now (you\u2019re making me jealous). There\u2019s a fuster cluck of like-minded individuals who are one \u201chi\u201d away from joining your networking circle which will lead to freelance gigs and more.\n The next best thing is to goto local meetups. If you have none in your area for what you\u2019re interested in, then start one yourself. Sites like  meetup.com make it really easy to do this.\n Local meetups are awesome. You\u2019ll find people in start-ups looking to hire, other developers looking to build their network and in some cases the venue hosting the event will be recruiting (you can approach them for contract work).\n It\u2019s important to understand that your peers at meetups are your allies, not your competition. It\u2019s counter intuitive because by default you might be thinking  \u201chow can I find freelance work for development in a room full of developers?\u201d, but that\u2019s not how it works.\n First off, not everyone there will be a developer and secondly, you\u2019ll find people with very wide skill sets and agendas. 8 out of 50 people in the room might be there for the sole purpose of finding another developer to work on something with them. You just need to find them.\n You might be thinking  \u201cwhat am I supposed to say?\u201d. It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. For students, try approaching Bob outside of one of your classes and be like  \u201cHey Bob, I\u2019m Nick. We\u2019re in CS101 together. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what got you interested in computers?\u201d.\n At meetups, I usually just open with something that\u2019s relevant to the situation, such as:  \u201cHi, what brings you to a Docker meetup?\u201d and go from there.\n Remember, you\u2019re not going to find an answer book for all problems you\u2019ll face in life so you better get used to figuring things out on your own while doing self guided research, especially as a software developer.\n  By the way, I have no idea if the above university script works. Go test it and let me know in the comments.\n The only thing I do know is, as I\u2019ve been  leveling up my communication skills, I have found out that people love talking about themselves. You can\u2019t go wrong.\n Everyone can start calling local businesses to find freelance work too. You will find plenty of opportunities here. Sure you have to pick up a phone, but if it lands you a $2,000 deal that requires 10-20 hours of work, then why are you upset?\n Here\u2019s a story for you. If you\u2019ve been following my blog then you know that I do a lot of walking. Usually I walk 3 miles a day. I find it very relaxing and it helps me think, but it\u2019s also a source of freelance clients.\n Yep, as I walk around town, there are vans and other work vehicles that drive by. They have phone numbers and website URLs plastered on their vehicles. You don\u2019t need to have an eidetic memory like Wesley Crusher on the U.S.S Enterprise to capitalize on this.\n The next time you see one of these vehicles, jot down, take a picture or make a voice recording memo of their phone number and website address. Bam, you have a new lead to contact and at the same time, you\u2019ve strengthened your leg muscles by walking.\n  I know you might be skeptical, and perhaps you were hoping for an article that told you to do 20 hours of research and busy work before you can get started but the reality of the situation is, as long as you have the technical skills to do the job, you can have your first client tomorrow.

Our mission was to build an education platform for the 21st century, with engaging content delivered in bite-size modules that can be consumed anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.\n I am happy to announce that  Grafana University is now live with our first learning playlist,  Introduction to the three pillars of observability. This playlist has four modules:  Introduction to observability,  Introduction to metrics,  Introduction to logs, and  Introduction to traces. It is aimed at anyone who is new to the world of  observability and the Grafana stack, giving both a solid foundation in the concepts of observability and a chance to get hands-on with Grafana.\n  One of the coolest things about the platform we\u2019ve built is the ability to provide hands-on experiences with the Grafana stack easily and quickly. With a single click of a button, you can spin up a Grafana instance, pre-configured with connections to our sample data sources. The lab environments are temporary sandboxes so they only exist for the duration of the lab, and they are not connected to your Grafana Cloud account. So you can feel free to explore and experiment all you want!\n From this humble beginning with our first learning playlist, Grafana University will grow to include more courses aimed at all the different users of the Grafana stack, from the people viewing and building dashboards to the teams responsible for installing, configuring, and administering the tools. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll be adding more learning playlists on the basics of building Grafana dashboards and working with  LogQL and  PromQL. (Got an idea about what we should cover? Email us at  education@grafana.com.)\n  Class is officially in session!  Grafana University is available for free to anyone in the world \u2014 simply log in with your Grafana Cloud account and get started. (Don\u2019t have a  Grafana Cloud account?\u00a0 Sign up for free today!)\n After taking a course, we\u2019re very interested in hearing any comments or feedback you may have, positive or negative, so if you have something to share, please  email us.\n  I would like to thank Matthew and S\u00e9an for all their work on this, as well as Heds Simons from our Field Engineering team for his assistance in getting the hands-on environments up and running. And of course, a big thank you to all the Grafanistas who supported us with comments, reviews, and contributions!", "posttime": "2022-01-10 18:25:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5927\u5b66,\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3,grafana,\u793e\u533a", "title": "\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3\u7eb3\u5927\u5b66", "title_en": "Grafana University", "transed": 1, "url": "https://grafana.com/blog/2022/01/03/introducing-grafana-university-our-virtual-hands-on-education-platform-thats-free-and-easy-to-use/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u5b66", "\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3", "grafana", "\u793e\u533a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "17b21ee7588eb216fa10bb2456128b02.jpeg", "infoid": 1072599, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u745e\u5178\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7537\u4eba\u4eca\u5929\u6d3b\u7740\uff0c\u611f\u8c22 - \u90e8\u5206 - \u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3002 71\u5c81\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u572812\u6708\u94f2\u96ea\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u540d\u8fc7\u6e21\u8005\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u4e2d\u98de\u5165\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u7684\u533b\u751f\u590d\u82cf\uff0c\u5468\u4e8c\u3002", "note_en": "A man in Sweden is alive today thanks to \u2014 in part \u2014 a drone. The 71-year-old had a heart attack while shoveling snow in December and was resuscitated by a nearby doctor after a drone flew in a defibrillator, Everdrone  reported Tuesday.\n Someone having a heart attack needs help within 10 minutes in order to survive. Everdrone\u2019s Emergency Medical Aerial Delivery (EMADE) service is designed to deliver help as quickly as possible \u2014 it allows emergency dispatchers to send a drone carrying the device to a caller\u2019s home, kickstarting the lifesaving process before the ambulance arrives at their home. In this particular patient\u2019s case, it took three minutes for the services to deliver the defibrillator to his home. A bystander, who happened to be a doctor on the way to his job, used the AED on the patient after providing CPR.\n The drone was developed with the Center for Resuscitation Science at Karolinska Institutet, SOS Alarm, and Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland.\n   \u201cThis is an excellent real-world example of how Everdrone\u2019s cutting edge drone technology, fully integrated with emergency dispatch, can minimize the time for access to live-saving AED equipment,\u201d Everdrone CEO Mats S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m said.\n In a four-month  pilot study testing the EMADE program, the service got 14 heart attack alerts that would be eligible for drones. Drones took off in 12 of those cases, and 11 successfully delivered the defibrillators. Seven of those defibrillators were delivered before the ambulance arrived.\n In Europe, about 275,000 patients suffer from cardiac arrest annually with approximately 70 percent of those arrests occurring in a private home without a defibrillator on site, according to Everdrone. The survival rate is  around 10 percent.\n Currently, the EMADE service can reach 200,000 Swedish residents. The company said it plans to expand to more locations in Europe this year.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 17:24:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53d1\u4f5c,carrying,\u9664\u98a4", "title": "\u643a\u5e26\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u62ef\u6551\u4e86\u745e\u5178\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\u60a3\u8005", "title_en": "Drone Carrying a Defibrillator Saves Its First Heart Attack Patient in Sweden", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868777/everdrone-drone-defibrillator-health-tech-sweden", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u4f5c", "carrying", "\u9664\u98a4"]}]
