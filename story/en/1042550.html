Everything was as I had left it: filing cabinet, desk, lights, reclining chair for reading and napping. The floor-to-ceiling shelves, covering almost every inch of available wall, were stuffed with books, arranged in an order that makes sense only to me. There were some new books to cram into already tightly packed shelves. Old hardbacks were reunited with the dust jackets that had been left behind as placeholders. There were quotes to check, and it was a pleasure, as always, to look these up — but some lingering, unspecified unease remained.</p><p>我离开伦敦学习已经六个月了，但是去年12月刚回来时，我感觉到出了点问题。一切都如我所愿：文件柜，书桌，灯，可躺的椅子供阅读和午睡。从地板到天花板的架子几乎覆盖了可用墙壁的每英寸，上面塞满了书，这些书的排列顺序对我来说才有意义。有一些新书塞进本来就很紧的书架。旧的精装书与留作占位符的防尘套重新结合在一起。需要检查报价，和以往一样，很高兴查找这些报价，但是仍然有一些挥之不去，不确定的不安。</p><p> On the third day, I needed to look up a line in “A Happy Death” and went over to the Camus section. There it was, along with the biography by Herbert Lottman that had fallen apart while I was reading it in Algiers in 1991. But where was Olivier Todd’s biography of Camus — a hardback that I’d reviewed when the English edition came out in 1997? It was conspicuous in its absence, like the character in the Dylan song: “The only person on the scene missin’ was the Jack of Hearts.” I looked along the Camus section, then to one side among the Calassos and Calvinos and, on the other, in the Careys (Peter) and Carys (Joyce). I extended the search into the B’s and D’s. Nothing. So that explained the weird feeling of unspecified wrong. My Olivier Todd biography of Camus had gone.</p><p> 第三天，我需要在“幸福的死亡”中查找一行，然后转到“加缪”部分。在那里，还有赫伯特·洛特曼（Herbert Lottman）的传记在我1991年在阿尔及尔阅读时就瓦解了。但是奥利维尔·托德（Olivier Todd）的加缪传记在哪里？精装本，当我在1997年英文版发行时进行了评论？它在缺席时很显眼，就像迪伦（Dylan）歌曲中的角色一样：“现场唯一想念的人是红心杰克”。我沿着加缪（Camus）区域看了一眼，然后朝着加拉索斯（Calassos）和加尔维诺斯（Calvinos）的一侧，另一侧则是凯里（Peter）和卡里斯（Carys）（乔伊斯）。我将搜索范围扩展到了B和D。没有。这样就解释了未指定错误的怪异感觉。我对加缪（Carus）的奥利维尔·托德（Olivier Todd）的传记已经消失了。</p><p> Andrew, an American friend who had stayed at the flat while we were away, was an avowed Camus fan and therefore the prime suspect. But knowing me, knowing how well I knew where everything went, he must have known he could never pull off a heist like this.</p><p> 美国朋友安德鲁（Andrew）在我们离开时一直呆在公寓里，他是加缪（Camus）的忠实拥fan，因此是主要犯罪嫌疑人。但是认识我，知道我对一切进展的了解，他一定知道他永远不会做出这样的抢劫。</p><p> Another possibility was that although I had only now registered its absence, the book had actually gone missing, unnoticed, years earlier. This was as hard to credit as the loss was hard to bear — because the loss was not confined to the Camus bio. My entire library had been ruined in the way that a small ink stain destroys a shirt. Rationally, I knew that the library was not significantly diminished by the loss of a book I would never need to consult again, but I also felt that I no longer even  had a library. I summoned all of my powers of nonattachment — of which I have none — and tried to come to terms with this loss.</p><p> 另一个可能性是，尽管我现在才刚刚注册它的缺席，但实际上这本书早在几年前就已经丢失，未被注意到。这和损失难以承受一样难以置信-因为损失不仅限于Camus bio。我的整个图书馆被毁坏了，一点墨水渍毁坏了衬衫。合理地说，我知道图书馆并没有因为我不再需要再次查阅而丢失的书而大大减少了，但是我也觉得我什至没有图书馆。我召集了我所有的不依恋权力，但我却没有，但我试图弥补这种损失。</p><p> Andrew’s own house in Los Angeles had partly burned down, so he was living elsewhere while it was renovated. I’d been really worried about this fire, and not only because, at the time, he had borrowed my copy of Mark Lilla’s “The Once and Future Liberal.” (Fortunately, it was not even smoke-damaged. “Thank God!” I’d texted.) Another friend, Pico Iyer, had lost his childhood home in a fire in California and when we’d been on a panel together, he’d said that the experience had taught him that the only things that matter are the things you can carry in your heart and head. He got a round of applause from the sympathetic audience, but I got a laugh when I mimed the gesture of throwing up. The things that matter to me are things. At some level, I think it’s an only-child trait: Lacking sisters, brothers and, in my case, pets, we become overfond of our toys, develop excessive emotional attachment to the works of Beatrix Potter. But Pico is an only child, too, so there must be more to it than that.</p><p> 安德鲁在洛杉矶自己的房子已部分烧毁，因此他在翻修时住在其他地方。我真的很担心这种大火，不仅是因为当时他借用了我的马克·里拉（Mark Lilla）的著作《曾经与未来的自由主义者》。 （幸运的是，它甚至没有烟尘。“感谢上帝！”我发短信。）另一个朋友皮科·艾耶（Pico Iyer）在加利福尼亚的一场大火中失去了他的童年时光，当我们一起在面板上时，他曾说过，这种经历教会了他，唯一重要的事情就是你可以随心所欲携带的东西。他得到了同情的听众的掌声，但是当我模仿呕吐的姿势时，我笑了起来。对我来说重要的是事情。从某种程度上说，我认为这是独生子女的特征：缺少姐妹，兄弟以及我的宠物，我们对玩具不满，对Beatrix Potter的作品产生了过度的情感依恋。但是Pico也是独生子，因此它所包含的不只是这个。</p><p> “Whatever the reason,” I said to my wife as she tried to console me after the Camus episode, “I’ll just never love another human being as much as I love my books.”</p><p> “不管是什么原因，”我在加缪（Camus）事件发生后试图安慰我的妻子对我说，“我永远不会像爱书本一样爱另一个人。”</p><p> Life had to go on, of course, and it did, sort of. But while sitting in my study, I was conscious that I had to avoid letting my gaze stray into the C section, and that if I did happen to glance over there, I would always fixate on this weird biblio equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle in the vain hope that, in all of my previous searches, I had somehow overlooked the book with Cartier-Bresson’s portrait of Camus on the cover, staring me existentially in the face.</p><p> 当然，生活必须继续下去，而且确实如此。但是当我坐在书房中时，我意识到我必须避免将视线误入C部分，并且如果我确实瞥了一眼那儿，我将始终专注于等效于百慕大三角的这本怪异的书目。希望在以前的所有搜索中，我都以某种方式忽略了这本书，而卡地亚-布雷森（Cartier-Bresson）的加缪（Camus）肖像被盖在了封面上，面无表情地盯着我。 </p><p> And then, as happens in thrillers, a quite extraordinary plot twist occurred. My in-laws came to stay for Christmas. It was lovely. My father-in-law also has an impressive library that he guards quite jealously. I’d borrowed a copy of Thomas Mann’s (long out-of-print) “Last Essays” from him and though he remained calm and courteous, it was obvious to me that all he was thinking about was getting his mitts on it again. My sister-in-law, meanwhile, was happily reading my copy of “The Names,” by Don DeLillo, but she didn’t look as if she would finish it by the end of her stay. To my astonishment, I heard myself say that she could borrow it even though it was a British first edition, signed by the Donster himself. Coming rapidly to my senses, I said that she should leave the cover behind, partly to preserve it from damage (preserve from damage the thing intended to protect the book itself from damage) and partly to indicate that it was “out on loan” (not a phrase I ever thought I’d hear myself utter).</p><p>然后，就像惊悚片中发生的那样，情节发生了非常不寻常的扭曲。我的公婆来圣诞节过。太可爱了。我的岳父也有一个令人印象深刻的图书馆，他十分嫉妒。我从他那里借了一份托马斯·曼（Thomas Mann）的绝版《最后的散文》（Last Essays），尽管他保持镇定和礼貌，但对我来说，显然他想的只是重新穿上手套。同时，我的sister子正在愉快地阅读唐·德利洛（Don DeLillo）撰写的《名字》（The Names）副本，但她看起来好像并不会在住完后就完成了。令我惊讶的是，我听到自己说即使她是唐斯特本人亲自签名的英国第一版，她也可以借用。令我感动的是，我说她应该把封面丢下，一方面是为了保护书本不受损坏（为了保护书本不受损坏，而要保护书本不受损坏），另一方面是指出书本是“借出的”（不是我曾经以为自己会说出自己的话的词组）。</p><p> But  that wasn’t the plot twist. The twist occurred when Sharon, my mother-in-law, prompted by all of this loose and jolly talk about borrowing and lending, said — and she didn’t  confess, she simply  said — that she still had my copy of the Olivier Todd biography of Camus. It was an electrifying moment. My wife told everyone that I had been “in a right old tizz” over that book, but now I was, as they say, overjoyed that it was safe. No one could explain how it had ended up at my in-laws’ house. Sharon had never been in our flat on her own and my wife could not recall lending it to her — something she does not have the authority to do. That, if you like, is the unresolved front story. The back story was that Sharon was less interested in Albert than in his biographer, randy old Olivier (in his 90s now), who had pursued her in the early 1960s when she came from Arkansas to study piano in Paris, where she had met my father-in-law while he was researching his doctorate.</p><p> 但这不是情节的转折。当我的岳母莎朗在关于借贷的所有闲杂而愉快的谈话中提示时，发生了这种转变：她不承认，她只是简单地说，她仍然拥有我的奥利维尔·托德（Olivier Todd）的副本。加缪的传记。那是一个激动人心的时刻。我的妻子告诉所有人，我在那本书上“经历了一次适当的磨合”，但是现在，正如他们所说，我为它的安全感到高兴。没有人能解释它是如何在我岳母家中发生的。沙龙从来没有一个人待在我们的公寓里，我的妻子也想不起把它借给她-她无权这样做。如果您愿意，那就是未解决的前沿故事。背后的故事是沙龙对阿尔伯特的兴趣不如对传记作家兰迪·奥利维耶（现年90多岁）的兴趣小。后者在1960年代初从阿肯色州来到巴黎求学时就追求她，在那里她认识了我。岳父在研究博士学位时。</p><p> At this point the story could have been called “All’s Well That Ends Well,” but, as viewers of “The Undoing” know all too well, the end is not always the end and all was far from well. Early in the new year, it seems, the Todd somehow got mixed in with a stack of books from my father-in-law’s study that he had offloaded on various unsuspecting charity shops. I felt I was in a position to sue for punitive damages, that in a kind of reverse decimation, I was entitled to 10 titles of my choice from my father-in-law’s library for the (double) loss of this one of mine.</p><p> 在这个时候，这个故事本来可以叫做“一切顺利，一切都好”，但是，由于“撤消”的观众都知道得太多，结局并不总是结局，而且一切都不尽人意。新年伊始，托德似乎与我岳父的书房里的一堆书混在一起，他把书卖给了许多毫无戒心的慈善商店。我觉得我可以要求赔偿惩罚性赔偿，以一种反向抽取的方式，我从岳父的图书馆中获得了我所选择的10个冠军（因为我的这个（双重）损失）。</p><p> Long months passed, during which time Camus, for some inexplicable reason, gradually slid down the rankings of my list of most-loved authors. Other things happened in and to our burning world. One of these, Covid-19, means that we won’t be back in Britain this year — a shame, because there is late breaking news. Poor Camus was not deported to the well-meaning Oxfam gulag after all. He has been found, not alive and well exactly, but adequately preserved, wearing his dusty dust jacket, among a box of assorted junk in my in-laws’ pantry. What was he doing there? No explanation has been forthcoming, but it would be absurd, in Camus’s terms, to “admit sin and refuse grace.” In a case swathed in mystery, there is room for the miraculous.</p><p> 漫长的几个月过去了，在这段时间里，加缪（Camus）出于某种莫名其妙的原因，使我最喜欢的作家名单的排名逐渐下滑。在我们燃烧的世界中发生了其他事情。其中之一就是Covid-19，这意味着我们今年不会回到英国-太可惜了，因为有最新新闻。毕竟，可怜的加缪并没有被放逐到好心的乐施会。人们发现他身穿尘土飞扬的尘土外套，在我公婆的食品储藏室里装了一箱什锦的垃圾，活着并没有完全好，但被保存得很好。他在那里做什么？暂时没有任何解释，但是用加缪的话来说，“承认罪恶并拒绝恩典”是荒谬的。在一个神秘的案例中，奇迹的存在空间。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/books/review/lost-and-found-a-missing-camus-biography-and-a-christmas-miracle.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/books/review/lost-and-found-a-missing-camus-biography-and-a-christmas-miracle.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/圣诞节/">#圣诞节</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/missing/">#missing</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
