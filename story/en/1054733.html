She found it really off-putting, like a pitch for a pyramid scheme. He had the best of intentions, she thought: NFTs, or  non-fungible tokens, are basically just a way of selling and buying anything digital, including art, that’s supported by cryptocurrency. Since she’s a concept artist and illustrator, it would make sense for Podedworna to have some interest in them. “He just phrased it in the most unfortunate way possible,” she says.</p><p>Anna Podedworna首先在一个月左右的时候听到了NFT，当一个艺术家派遣她的Instagram消息试图让她放在船上。她发现它真的脱掉了，就像金字塔方案的音高一样。他拥有最好的意图，她思考：NFT或非娱乐标记，基本上只是一种销售和购买任何数字，包括艺术的方式，这是通过加密货币的支持。自从她是一个概念艺术家和插画家以来，Podedworna对他们感兴趣有意义。 “他只是以最不幸的方式削弱了它，”她说。</p><p>  Most of Podedworna’s income comes from the video game companies that hire her to work on their projects, but she makes her own art on the side. So despite her initial reaction to NFTs, she started researching whether they might provide some alternative income.</p><p>  Podedworna的大部分收入来自雇用她的项目的视频游戏公司，但她在侧面制作了自己的艺术。因此，尽管对NFTS的初步反应，但她开始研究他们是否可以提供一些替代收入。</p><p>  She’s still on the fence, but last week someone attempted to make the decision for her. Marble Cards, an NFT marketplace that sells URLs to pretty much any spot on the web as if they were digital trading cards, suddenly started showing listings for links to her work. NFTs like these aren’t necessarily attempting to sell the art itself, but the entries prominently featured her work and her name, giving the impression that she had authorized them. She tweeted about it and they were, rather promptly, taken down.</p><p>  她还在围栏上，但上周有人试图为她做出决定。大理石卡，一个NFT市场，将网址销售到网上的任何地方，似乎是数字交易卡，突然开始向她的工作显示列表。像这些一样的NFT不一定试图销售艺术本身，但参赛作品突出了她的工作和她的名字，给人留下了她授权他们的印象。她发了推文，他们相当迅速地取消了。</p><p> So of course it happened to me too. Someone is trying to sell my art as NFTs. Unfortunately for them, those works were done for  @dota2 ,  @PlayGwent and  @CyberpunkGame  So I&#39;ll be simply forwarding those to Valve&#39;s and CDPR&#39;s legal. You have fun with that  @marble_cards  pic.twitter.com/iK7DMom8sY</p><p> 所以当然也发生在我身上。有人试图将我的艺术销售为NFTS。不幸的是，这些作品是为@ dota2，@playgwent和@cyberpunkgame完成的，所以我＆＃39; ll只是将那些转发到阀门＆＃39; s和cdpr＆＃39; s法律。你有@marble_cards pic.twitter.com/ik7dmom8sy很开心</p><p>— akreon (@_akreon_)  March 15, 2021</p><p> -  Akreon（@_akreon_）3月15日，2021年3月15日</p><p> NFTs have become an unavoidable subject for anyone earning a living as a creative person online, prompting a rush to understand a concept that is deeply mired in the jargon of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Some promise that NFTs are part of a digital revolution that will democratize fame and give creators control over their destinies. Others point to the environmental impact of crypto and worry about unrealistic expectations set by, say, the news that digital artist  Beeple had sold a JPG of his collected works for $69 million in a Christie’s auction.</p><p> NFTS已成为一个不可避免的主题，任何人都在网上谋生，促使急于了解一个在加密货物和区块科技的术语中深入融入的概念。一些承诺，NFT是数字革命的一部分，将民主化，并使创作者控制其目的地。其他人指出了Crypto的环境影响，并且担心数字艺术家BEEPLE在Christie的拍卖中销售了6900万美元的JPG的JPG。</p><p>  Just as the trend is shuffling the deck on what is considered “valuable” digital art, however, it’s also re-creating some of the same problems that have plagued artists for ages: confusing hype, the whims of rich collectors, and theft. Digital artists already battle scammers who steal artwork and sell it as merchandise on user-generated T-shirt shops, for instance. NFTs are now simply another thing artists have to check.</p><p>  正如这一趋势随着被认为是“有价值”的数字艺术的趋势，但是，它也重新创造了一些困扰艺术家的一些问题：令人困惑的炒作，丰富的收藏家的狂热和盗窃。例如，数字艺术家已经争取诈骗艺术品并将其销售为商品在用户生成的T恤商店上的商品。 NFT现在只是艺术家必须检查的另一件事。 </p><p>  Newcomers must untangle practical, logistical, and ethical conundrums if they want to enter the fray before the current wave of interest passes. And as some artists turn their digital creations into profitable offerings for a new audience of friendly, enthusiastic buyers, there’s a question lingering in the background: Is the NFT craze benefiting digital artists, or are artists helping to make wealthy cryptocurrency holders even richer?</p><p>如果他们想在当前的利息浪潮通过之前，新人必须解开实用，后勤和道德难题。随着一些艺术家将他们的数字创作转变为有利可图的产品，为一个友好的热情买家的新观众，在背景中有一个问题：nft热潮是否有利于数字艺术家，或者是艺术家帮助使富裕的加密货架甚至更丰富的艺术家？</p><p>    Ellie Pritts, a photographer and animator from Los Angeles, learned about NFTs after talking to Foundation, an invite-only NFT marketplace, several months ago. Another artist recruited her for the site’s digital print business, but then she spoke with  Kayvon Tehranian, the founder of Foundation, who mentioned its NFT sales.</p><p>    来自洛杉矶的摄影师和动画师，洛杉矶的摄影师和动画师在与基金会交谈后了解NFTS，几个月前邀请NFT市场。另一位艺术家招募了她的网站的数字印刷业务，但随后她与基金会创始人的Kayvon Tehranian谈过，他提到了其NFT销售。</p><p>  “I was like, I don’t understand this. But it seems really interesting,” she says. “And there wasn’t a lot of information about it, but I was intrigued. He was actually the person who taught me about it.”</p><p>  “我就像，我不明白这一点。但似乎真的很有趣，“她说。 “而且没有关于它的很多信息，但我感到愤怒。他实际上是教我关于它的人。“</p><p>  Non-fungible tokens are unique pieces of data that are part of a blockchain, bought and sold with the currency that blockchain supports. The ones you’re hearing about are pretty much all supported by Ethereum.</p><p>  非娱乐标记是一部分区块链的独特数据，并与区块链支持的货币购买和销售。你听到的那些人几乎都是以外人的支持。</p><p>  If you haven’t heard of  Ethereum, you’ve probably heard of Bitcoin. Same idea; different blockchain. And while Bitcoin is primarily about exchanging money, Ethereum is better for exchanging assets. Any blockchain can in theory support NFTs, but this one was designed for them. NFTs are sold on any of various online marketplaces, where users can “mint,” or create, one for anything digital.</p><p>  如果你没有听说过以外人，你可能听说过比特币。同样的想法;不同的区块链。虽然比特币主要是关于交换资金，但以太国更适合交换资产。任何区块链可以理解支持NFT，但这是为他们设计的。 NFT在各种在线市场中销售，用户可以在其中“薄荷”或创建，一个用于数字。</p><p>  An NFT doesn’t mean that you own the piece of art itself. Instead, you’re basically buying metadata that grants you bragging rights—or, more often, the opportunity to sell that NFT later for even more money.</p><p>  一个nft并不意味着你拥有自己的艺术本身。相反，您基本上购买了赠送您吹牛权的元数据 - 或者更常见的是，在以后卖出那个NFT的机会。</p><p>    It’s a lot to take in, and sounds a bit strange. Pritts was skeptical until she minted and sold her first NFT in February. It was a short video piece she’d made for herself, without the expectation of getting paid: it sold for about a thousand dollars. Animation is time-consuming and expensive to create and has, historically, been difficult to sell for a fair price online. Maybe NFTs would let her do that, she thought. Mainly, though, selling just felt good. “That feeling that something that I made just because I love it has value is amazing,” she says. “The people who bought my pieces were doing a lot of research. They weren’t people that I knew. They decided to invest in me because they had looked into me and thought that I was promising.”</p><p>    拍摄很多，听起来有点奇怪。 Pritts持怀疑态度，直到她在2月份铸造并卖掉了她的第一个NFT。这是她为自己制作的短视频片，而不期望得到报酬：它卖出了大约一千美元。动画是耗时和昂贵的创造和历史上，难以在线销售公平的价格。也许NFTS会让她做到这一点。尽管如此，销售刚刚感觉很好。 “那种我只是因为我喜欢它有价值而令人惊叹的东西，”那种感觉是令人惊叹的。“ “买了我的作品的人正在做很多研究。他们不是我知道的人。他们决定投资我，因为他们看着我，以为我很有希望。“ </p><p>  Tiffany Zhong, the founder of Islands, a creator platform that focuses on revenue streams, says that buyers aren’t necessarily supporting artists just as “cash grabs.” Instead, she thinks NFTs could become a different way for creators to build a fan base. Buying in early to an artist’s work comes with a sense of ownership, like having seen a now famous band at its very first gig. “If you’re an early supporter of a creator,” she says, “you’re betting on them.”</p><p>蒂芙尼钟岛的创造力平台专注于收入流，表示，买家不一定支持艺术家就像“现金抓取”。相反，她认为NFTS可能成为创造者建立粉丝基地的不同方式。早在艺术家的工作中购买都具有所有权感，就像在第一个演出中看到了现在着名的乐队一样。 “如果你是一个创造者的早期支持者，”她说，“你敢打赌。”</p><p>  Pritts now feels like part of a community: she’s working on half a dozen collaborations with other artists who also mint NFTs, people she would never have met before jumping in a month ago. And, she says, she’s doubled her monthly income—in theory. The money is all in Ether rather than dollars, and she hasn’t cashed out yet.</p><p>  Pritts现在感觉像社区的一部分：她正在与其他艺术家合作，她在一个月前跳跃之前她永远不会见面的其他艺术家。她说，她每月收入的理论都翻了一番。这笔钱都是以太，而不是美元，而且她还没有兑现。</p><p>    One of the difficult things about understanding NFTs is the jargon barrier; all the terms that explain how it works are really only familiar to people who already get crypto. As a result, a lot of the information on NFTs comes from its biggest evangelists: the marketplaces that sell them, the people who invest in them, and the artists who create them. To everyone else, it’s a bamboozle.</p><p>    关于理解NFT的困难的事情之一是行话障碍;所有解释它如何运作的条款真的只熟悉已经加密的人。因此，有关NFT的许多信息来自其最大的福音传教士者：销售它们的市场，投资于他们的人和创造它们的艺术家。对其他人来说，这是一个竹子丛。</p><p>  Amid the sudden rush of interest in this new avenue for their work, though, many artists have turned into guides for others.</p><p>  然而，在这个新的大道的兴趣突然涌入他们的工作，许多艺术家已经成为他人的指南。</p><p>  Pinguino Kolb, an artist and longtime cryptocurrency advocate, has been flooded with questions from other artists about NFTs over the past month. “I get a lot of questions on why people are excited about it. That’s even from some of my programmer friends that know the crypto space,” she says. “They don’t understand why people are buying it.”</p><p>  Pinguino Kolb，艺术家和长期加密货币倡导者已经被其他艺术家在过去一个月内从其他艺术家淹没的问题。 “我对人们对此感到兴奋的原因有很多问题。甚至来自我的一些程序员朋友，知道加密空间，“她说。 “他们不明白为什么人们买它。”</p><p>  Her answer, essentially, is that it’s fun. “I think it broke a lot of the monotony of the pandemic. Because we’re not going to events or anything. We’re not going to art shows,” she says. “All of a sudden in the past month, my whole Twitter feed is just filled with artwork, and that wasn’t the case before.”</p><p>  基本上，她的回答是它很有趣。 “我认为这违反了大流行的单调。因为我们不会参加活动或任何事情。我们不去艺术表演，“她说。 “在过去的一个月突然，我的整个Twitter Feed都刚刚充满了艺术品，这并非如此。”</p><p>  In mid-March Kolb  held a Zoom seminar where she explained the whole thing to artists who had never purchased cryptocurrency. She hopes the information will help people figure out whether getting involved makes sense for them, she says. But it won’t for everyone.</p><p>  3月中旬Kolb举行了一个缩放研讨会，她向从未购买过加密货管的艺术家解释了整个艺术家。她表示，她希望这些信息能够帮助人们弄清楚是否对他们来说是有道理的。但它不会适合每个人。 </p><p>  “If you’re telling an already busy artist to drop everything they’re doing and jump on this train because they’re going to lose out,” she says, “I don’t think that’s something they should do.”</p><p>“如果你告诉已经忙碌的艺术家，可以放弃他们正在做的一切，因为他们会失败，”她说，“我认为这不是他们应该做的事情。”</p><p>  “You can’t just make an NFT, release it into the wild, and automatically somebody is going to buy it,” she adds. “You have to promote it. You have to put the legwork into it. You know, a lot of times you have to become more involved with that community. All that takes time. And if that’s not your core audience, it probably doesn’t make sense for you to do.”</p><p>  “你不能只是做一个nft，把它释放到野外，并自动送给它，”她补充道。 “你必须推广它。你必须把腿部放入其中。你知道，很多时候你必须更加参与那个社区。所有这一切都需要时间。如果这不是你的核心观众，那么你可能没有意义。“</p><p>    Canadian concept artist Kimberly Parker first started hearing about NFTs a couple of years ago, when an artist she follows began to sell his work.</p><p>    加拿大概念艺术家金伯利帕克在几年前开始听到NFTS，当时她跟随的艺术家开始销售他的工作。</p><p>  “I checked in on some of the top artists and was pretty shocked by the amount of money they were making from these sales, since most of it was just 2D images, JPGs, the kind of work that a lot of my peers and I were selling for pennies by comparison, if at all,” she says.</p><p>  “我在一些顶级艺术家们拜访了他们从这些销售中所做的金额非常震惊，因为大部分时间只是2D图像，JPG，我的那种工作和我的工作相比之下，销售便士，如果大自一体，“她说。</p><p>  Even more confusing was that the art varied widely in quality: bad meme art was doing well right alongside beautiful, time-intensive animations, sometimes purchased by the same investor. People buy NFTs for many reasons, but one is that they think they can flip it for more money later. This didn’t turn her away from NFTs, though: instead, as she continued her research, what really disturbed her was learning about their environmental impact.</p><p>  更令人困惑的是，艺术质量越来越多地变化：坏模型艺术与美丽，时间密集的动画相同，有时由同一投资者购买。人们出于许多原因购买NFTS，但其中一个是他们认为他们以后可以将其推翻。然而，这并没有让她远离NFTs：相反，因为她继续研究，那么真正打扰了她的环境影响。</p><p>  There are a couple of different ways in which blockchains can grow. Ethereum, like Bitcoin, uses a method called “proof of work,” in which computers have to solve complex math problems in order to add anything to the blockchain. That takes a lot of processing power, which is rare and expensive—and part of what gives cryptocurrencies their value. And it’s also why it costs money up front, called a “gas fee,” to mint an NFT.</p><p>  有几种不同的方式，其中块链可以增长。像比特币一样的Ethereum使用一种名为“工作证明”的方法，其中计算机必须解决复杂的数学问题，以便为区块链添加任何内容。这需要很多处理能力，这是罕见的且昂贵的 - 并且部分给出了加密货币的一部分。而且它也是为什么它可以花费金钱，称为“天然气费”，以薄荷为NFT。</p><p>   That processing power requires electricity, which generates emissions. As Ethereum grows, so does its pollution output. According to the energy consumption tracker on the website Digiconomist,  Bitcoin has a carbon footprint comparable to that of Switzerland, while  Ethereum’s is comparable to Tanzania’s.</p><p>   处理能力需要电力，从而产生排放。随着Ethereum的增长，它的污染产出也是如此。根据网站上的能源消耗跟踪器，比特币具有与瑞士相当的碳足迹，而国内则与坦桑尼亚相媲美。 </p><p>  “For someone like me, who is very privileged and able to support myself already, it instantly became morally indefensible,” Parker says.</p><p>“对于像我这样的人，谁非常有趣，能够支持自己，它立即变得道德上不可敏感，”帕克说。</p><p>  Anna Podedworna  knows about the environmental impact of NFTs: it’s part of why she’s hesitant to start minting them. But she has another motivation for considering them seriously.</p><p>  Anna Podedworna了解NFTS的环境影响：这是她犹豫要开始铸造它们的原因。但她认真考虑他们的另一个动机。</p><p>  Podedworna lives in Poland and is concerned about her country’s increasingly right-wing, nationalist government. “Having some alternative income that is based in cryptocurrencies is sounding better and better,” she says. “I mean, I see where things are going in my country, and I have family to worry about.”</p><p>  Podedworna住在波兰，并担心她的国家日益右翼，民族主义政府。 “在加密货币中有一些替代收入听起来更好，更好，”她说。 “我的意思是，我看到我所在的国家的地方，我有家人担心。”</p><p>  Ethereum has long promised to switch to a more energy-efficient system called “proof of stake,” but in the meantime, some creators are purchasing carbon offsets for the NFTs they mint. Ellie Pritts, the photographer and animator, argues that it’s unfair to single out artists for participating in something that produces pollution, given the many more common activities that do as well.</p><p>  Evereum已答应转向更节能的系统，称为“股份证明”，但与此同时，一些创造者正在购买他们薄荷的NFTS的碳偏移。雷威法尔（Ellie Pritts）认为，摄影师和动画师认为，鉴于许多常见的活动也是如此，对艺术家参与产生污染的东西是不公平的。</p><p>  Andres Guadamuz, a senior lecturer in intellectual-property law at the University of Sussex who studies cryptocurrencies and copyright, cautions that even Ethereum’s plans to reduce its carbon footprint may exacerbate the inequality that already exists between rich early investors in the currency and everyone else.</p><p>  Andres Guadamuz是苏塞克斯大学知识产权法的高级讲师，他研究了加密货币和版权，甚至以Ethereum的降低碳足迹的计划可能会加剧丰富早期投资者在货币和其他人之间存在的不平等。</p><p>  Proof of stake removes the need for enormous processing power by replacing the mining process with one that  essentially ties mining power to your financial stake in the cryptocurrency. “It builds in the inequality that is already in the system,” Guadamuz says. “So the people that make all the decisions are the people who are already very rich in the system.”</p><p>  股权证明消除了通过将采矿过程替换为基本上挖掘挖掘电力的挖掘过程来消除巨大的加工能力。 “它在系统中建立了不平等，”瓜德米兹说。 “所以让所有决定的人都是在系统中已经非常丰富的人。”</p><p>    While it may feel as though NFTs are suddenly everywhere, the wave of interest started several years ago. Cryptokitties, a blockchain game based on Ethereum in which people buy and trade digital cats, launched in 2017  and was so popular that the traffic slowed down transactions on the entire network.</p><p>    虽然它可能觉得随着NFT突然到处都是，但兴趣的浪潮很多年前开始。 Cryptokitties是一款基于Ethereum的区块链游戏，其中人们购买和贸易数码猫，2017年推出，并且在整个网络上的交通减缓了交易的欢迎。 </p><p>  But Cryptokitties didn’t generate nearly the same amount of interest that NFTs now have. Essentially, Guadamuz argues, NFTs have evolved alongside ever-growing hype about cryptocurrencies in general: an attention economy inside an attention economy.</p><p>但是加密会没有产生几乎相同的NFT数量。基本上，瓜达曼兹辩称，NFT一般来说，在不断增长的炒作中，一般来说：注意经济内部的注意力。</p><p>    And so now NFTs are getting hyped up because Ethereum is getting hyped up because Bitcoin is getting hyped up because ... of the pandemic? Low interest rates? Elon Musk’s tweets? Whatever the reason, it’s important to see the connection between those things, Guadamuz says.</p><p>    所以现在NFTS被炒作，因为Ethereum正在炒作，因为比特币正在炒作，因为......大流行？低利率？伊隆麝香的推文？无论是什么原因，瓜达穆兹说，重要的是要看到这些事情之间的联系。</p><p>  While artists are benefiting from NFT sales, he argues, Ethereum stakeholders are benefiting even more. “No matter how much money you put in right now, there are people that started this 10 years ago that you will never be able to match,” he says. All the people getting into the system now are just getting some of the vast amount of cryptocurrency that those people have accumulated over time.</p><p>  虽然艺术家受益于NFT销售，但他争辩，Ethereum利益相关者更多地受益。 “无论你现在赚多少钱，那么10年前就有人开始，你永远无法匹配，”他说。所有进入系统的人现在都只是获得其中一些人随着时间的推移积累的大量的加密货币。</p><p>  Parker worries about the business model of these marketplaces, and the promises they make to artists. Anyone who lists work typically has to pay a fee to do so—easily about $100. “For small artists, that’s a lot to gamble on,” she says. “Artists are being sold this dream of riches and more control, but they’re just being used to boost the speculative value and prestige of cryptocurrency.”</p><p>  派克担心这些市场的商业模式，以及他们对艺术家所做的承诺。任何清单工作的人通常都必须支付费用，以便如此100美元。 “对于小艺术家来说，这是很多赌博的人，”她说。 “艺术家正在卖掉这一财富和更多的控制梦，​​但他们只是被用来提高加密货币的投机价值和声望。”</p><p>  Pritts says she’s frustrated by the amount of scrutiny that NFT artists are receiving, especially since for her, the work has been both financially and artistically fulfilling.</p><p>  Pritts说，她对NFT艺术家正在接受的审查量感到沮丧，特别是因为对她来说，这项工作一直在经济上和艺术上实现。</p><p>  “It feels like it’s kind of like every other week there’s a new thing that’s trending as a reason to not like what we’re doing,” she says. “Environmental has been the biggest one for sure. But recently, the new one is that this whole thing is a Ponzi scheme or a pyramid scheme.” That is a characterization she strongly disagrees with.</p><p>  “感觉就像每隔一周都一样，这是一个新的东西，这是一个趋势，因为不喜欢我们正在做的原因，”她说。 “环境一直是最大的。但最近，新的是这整件事是Ponzi计划或金字塔方案。“这是她强烈不同意的特征。</p><p>  “The way that I view it is essentially a new version of an old thing,” she says. What critics are tapping into when they call the NFT craze a pyramid scheme is that “only the people at the top make it.” But “that’s just being an artist,” she argues. “That’s always been how it is. Unfortunately, we cannot all make it.”</p><p>  “我认为它的方式基本上是一个新版本的旧东西，”她说。当他们称之为NFT热潮时，批评金字塔方案是什么批评者是“只有顶部的人民才能成为”。但是“这只是一个艺术家，”她争辩说。 “这一直都是它的。不幸的是，我们不能全都成功。“ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/25/1021215/nft-artists-scams-profit-environment-blockchain/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/25/1021215/nft-artists-scams-profit-environment-blockchain/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/tapping/">#tapping</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术家/">#艺术家</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
