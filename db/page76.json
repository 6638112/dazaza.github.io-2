", "note_en": "In June of 2013, Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist, grew curious about the subject of plagiarism. She had read that scientific dishonesty was a growing problem, and she idly wondered if her work might have been stolen by others. One day, she pasted a sentence from one of her scientific papers into the Google Scholar search engine. She found that several of her sentences had been copied, without permission, in an obscure online book. She pasted a few more sentences from the same book chapter into the search box, and discovered that some of them had been purloined from other scientists\u2019 writings.\n Bik has a methodical, thorough disposition, and she analyzed the chapter over the weekend. She found that it contained text plagiarized from eighteen uncredited sources, which she categorized using color-coded highlighting. Searching out plagiarism became a kind of hobby for Bik; she began trawling Google Scholar for more cases in her off-hours, when she wasn\u2019t working as a researcher at Stanford. She soon identified thirty faked biomedical papers, some in well-respected journals. She e-mailed the publications\u2019 editors, and, within a few months, some of the articles were retracted.\n In January, 2014, Bik was scrolling through a suspicious dissertation when she began glancing at the images, too. They included photographs known as Western blots, in which proteins appear as dark bands. Bik thought that she\u2019d seen one particular protein band before\u2014it had a fat little black dot at one end. Elsewhere in the dissertation, she found the same band flipped around and presented as if it were data from a different experiment. She kept looking, and spotted a dozen more Western blots that looked copied or subtly doctored. She learned that the thesis, written by a graduate student at Case Western Reserve University, had been published as two journal articles in 2010.\n The presence of a flawed image in a scientific study doesn\u2019t necessarily invalidate its central observations. But it can be a sign that something is amiss. In science, images are profoundly important: every picture and graph in a scientific paper is meant to represent data supporting the authors\u2019 findings. Photographic images, in particular, aren\u2019t illustrations but the evidence itself. It seemed to Bik that duplicated or doctored images could be more damaging to science than plagiarism.\n Bik decided to scan through some newly published studies in  PLOS One, an \u201copen access\u201d journal in which articles are made available to the public free of charge. (The journal\u2019s nonprofit publisher charges authors article-processing fees.) She opened fifteen articles, each in its own browser tab, and began eyeballing the images without reading the text. In a few hours, she\u2019d looked at around a hundred studies and spotted a few duplicate images. \u201cIt very quickly became addictive,\u201d Bik told me, in a marked Dutch accent. Night after night, she collected problematic articles, some with duplicate Western blots, others with copied images of cells or tissues. All had passed through peer review before being accepted. A few duplications could have been innocent\u2014perhaps a mixup by a scientist with a folder full of files. But other images had been cloned, stretched, zoomed, rotated, or reversed. The forms and patterns in biology are endlessly unique; Bik knew that these duplications couldn\u2019t have happened by accident. Yet she didn\u2019t want to mistakenly implicate a fellow-scientist in wrongdoing. She sent polite e-mails to the journals that had published the two Case Western studies. Editors eventually replied, promising to look into her concerns. Then six months passed with no further word. Bik was stymied.\n In 2012, three scientists had created a Web site called  PubPeer, where researchers could discuss one another\u2019s published work. Critics objected to the fact that the site allowed anonymous comments. Still, PubPeer was moderated to prohibit unsubstantiated accusations, and, in several cases, unnamed whistle-blowers had used it to bring attention to image manipulations or statistical errors, spurring major corrections and retractions. It seemed to Bik that posting her findings online involved crossing a boundary: the traditional way to raise questions about a paper\u2019s integrity was private communication with the authors, journals, or universities. She made an anonymous account anyway. \u201cI have concerns about some figures in this paper,\u201d she wrote, for each Case Western study. She uploaded screenshots of the image duplications, with the key areas clearly delineated by blue or red boxes, and clicked the button to submit.\n Scientific publishing is a multibillion-dollar industry. In biomedicine alone, more than 1.3 million papers are published each year; in all of science, there are more than twelve thousand reputable journals. Thousands of other Web-based journals publish even the flimsiest manuscripts after sham peer review, in exchange for processing fees. In China, researchers under pressure to meet unrealistic publication quotas purchase ghostwritten papers on a black market. Meanwhile, as the Web has made it easy for journals to proliferate, professional advancement in science has increasingly depended on publishing as many studies as possible.\n Around a decade ago, scientists began reckoning with the effects of this supercharged publish-or-perish system. A few cases of outright fraud\u2014including the British study that falsely linked vaccines to autism\u2014troubled specific scientific disciplines; in psychology, cancer research, and other fields, it was recognized that a meaningful proportion of studies had made overreaching claims and couldn\u2019t be replicated. Reforms were introduced. Watchdog Web sites such as PubPeer and  Retraction Watch sprang up, and a number of independent research-integrity detectives began unearthing cases of misconduct and sharing them through blogs, PubPeer, and on Twitter.\n  In March of 2019, when she was fifty-three, Bik decided to leave her job to do this detective work full time, launching a blog called  Science Integrity Digest. Over the past six and a half years\u2014while earning a bit of income from consulting and speaking, and receiving some crowdfunding\u2014she has identified more than forty-nine hundred articles containing suspect image duplications, documenting them in a master spreadsheet. On  Twitter, more than a hundred thousand people now follow her expos\u00e9s.\n  Bik grew up with two siblings in Gouda, in the Netherlands, where her mother and physician father ran a medical practice out of their red-brick house, on a tree-lined canal. At the age of eight, Bik wanted to become an ornithologist, and spent hours with binoculars, scanning the garden for birds and recording all the species she sighted. She discovered science, earned a Ph.D. in microbiology, and moved to the United States just after 9/11, when her husband, Gerard, an optical engineer, got a job in Silicon Valley. She spent fifteen years studying the microbiome in a Stanford laboratory before moving on to the biotech industry.\n  When Bik first stumbled upon the image-duplication issue, a few journal editors had been writing about it, but no one had ascertained the scale of the problem. She e-mailed two prominent microbiologists, Ferric Fang and Arturo Casadevall, who had studied retractions in science publishing, introducing herself along with image duplications she\u2019d found in  Infection and Immunity and  mBio\u2014journals for which Fang and Casadevall were the editors-in-chief, respectively. The three agreed to a systematic study. Bik would screen papers in forty different journals, and Fang and Casadevall would review her findings.\n In 2016, the team  published their results in  mBio. When journal editors examine questionable images, they typically use Photoshop tools that magnify, invert, stretch, or overlay pictures, but Bik does the same work mostly with her eyes and memory alone. Working at a speed of a few minutes per article, she had screened a jaw-dropping 20,621 studies. The team concluded that she was right ninety per cent of the time; the remaining ten per cent of images included some that were too low-resolution to allow for a clear determination. They reported \u201cinappropriate\u201d image duplications in seven hundred and eighty-two, or four per cent, of the papers; around a third of the flagged images involved simple copies, which could have been inadvertent errors, but at least half of the cases were sophisticated duplications which had likely been doctored. \u201cSometimes it seems almost like magic that the brain can do this,\u201d Fang told me, of Bik\u2019s abilities.\n The trio estimated that, of the millions of published biomedical studies, tens of thousands ought to be retracted for unreliable or faked images. But adjusting the scientific record can be maddeningly slow, especially when research is lower-profile. In total, it took journal editors more than thirty months to retract the two Case Western papers that Bik had reported. In addition to contacting editors, Bik sometimes reaches out to research institutions, or to the Office of Research Integrity (O.R.I.), a government agency responsible for investigating misconduct in federally funded science. But the O.R.I. and institutions have protocols\u2014they must obtain lab notebooks, conduct interviews, and so on\u2014which take time to unfold.\n By 2016, Bik had reported all seven hundred and eighty-two papers in the  mBio study to journal editors (including at  PLOS One). As of this June, two hundred and twenty-five had been corrected, twelve had been tagged with \u201cexpressions of concern,\u201d and eighty-nine had been retracted. (Among them were five discredited studies by a cancer researcher at Pfizer, who was fired.) As far as Bik knows, fifty-eight per cent of the studies remain at large. In the past five years, she has reported problematic images in another 4,132 studies; only around fifteen per cent have been addressed so far. (Three hundred and eighty-two have been retracted.) In only five or ten cases has she been told that authors proved her image concerns to be unfounded, she said.\n  Frustrated by these long timetables, Bik has transitioned to sharing more of her findings online, where journal readers can encounter them. On PubPeer, where she is the most prolific poster who uses her real name, her comments are circumspect\u2014she writes that images are \u201cremarkably similar\u201d or \u201cmore similar than expected.\u201d On Twitter, she is more performative, and often plays to a live audience. \u201c#ImageForensics Middle of the Night edition. Level: easy to advanced,\u201d Bik tweeted, at 2:41   one night. She posted an array of colorful photographs that resembled abstract paintings, including a striated vista of pink and white brushstrokes (a slice of heart tissue) and a fine-grained splattering of ruby-red and white flecks (a slice of kidney). Six minutes later, a biologist in the U.K. responded: two kidney photos appeared identical, she wrote. A minute later, another user flagged the same pair, along with three lung images that looked like the same tissue sample, shifted slightly. Answers continued trickling in from others; they drew Bik-style color-coded boxes around the cloned image parts. At 3:06  , Bik awarded the second user an emoji trophy for the best reply.\n In Silicon Valley, Bik and her husband live in an elegant mid-century-modern ranch house with a cheerful, orange front door and a low-angled pitched roof. In the neighborhood, the residence is one of many duplicate copies sporting varying color schemes. I visited Bik just before the pandemic began. Tall, with stylish blue tortoiseshell eyeglasses and shoulder-length chestnut hair, she wore a blouse with a recurring sky-blue-and-orange floral pattern and had a penetrating, blue-eyed gaze. While Bik made tea, her husband, clad in a red fleece jacket, toasted some frozen stroopwafel cookies, from Gouda.\n Playing tour guide, Bik showed off the original features of their kitchen, including its white Formica countertop, flecked with gold and black spots. \u201cIt\u2019s random!\u201d she assured me\u2014no duplications. The same could not be said of the textured gray porcelain floor tiles. When workers installed them, Bik explained, she\u2019d asked them to rotate the pieces that were identical, so that repeats would be less noticeable. A few duplicate tiles had ended up side-by-side anyway. I couldn\u2019t see the duplication until she traced an identical wavy ridge in each tile with both of her index fingers. \u201cSorry\u2014I\u2019m, like, weird,\u201d she said, and laughed.\n In her bedroom closet, Bik\u2019s shirts hung in a color gradient progressing from blacks and browns to greens and blues. Not long ago, she helped arrange her sister-in-law\u2019s enormous shoe collection by color on new storage racks; when some friends complained about the messy boxes of nuts, screws, and nails that littered their garage, Bik sorted them into little drawers. \u201cNothing makes me more happy,\u201d she told me. Since childhood, she has collected tortoise figurines and toys; around two thousand of them are arranged in four glass cabinets next to a blond-wood dining table. She keeps a spreadsheet tracking her turtle menagerie: there are turtles made from cowrie seashells, brass turtles, Delft blue porcelain turtles, bobble-headed turtles, turtle-shaped wood boxes with lids, and \u201cfunctional\u201d turtles (key chains, pencil sharpeners). She showed me a small stuffed animal with an eye missing: Turtle No. 1. (She has stopped adding to her collection. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to overtake my house,\u201d she said.)\n  That afternoon, Bik settled at her dining table, which serves as her desk. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a tranquil view of backyard foliage. On her curved widescreen monitor, Bik checked her Twitter account\u2014her bio featured a photo of a cactus garden; \u201cThat\u2019s me\u2014prickly,\u201d she said\u2014and then pulled up her master spreadsheet of problematic papers, which she doesn\u2019t share publicly. Each of its thousands of entries has more than twenty columns of details. She removed her glasses, set them next to a cup of chamomile tea, sat up straight, and began rapidly scanning papers from  PLOS One with her face close to the monitor. Starting with the first study\u2014about \u201cleucine zipper transcription factor-like 1\u201d\u2014she peered at an array of Western-blot images. She took screenshots and scrutinized them in Preview, zooming in and adjusting the contrast and brightness. (Occasionally, she uses Forensically and ImageTwin, tools that do some semi-automated photo-forensics analysis.) She moved on to a study with pink and purple cross-sections of mouse-gut tissue, then stopped on a figure with a dozen photos of translucent clumps of cells. She chuckled. \u201cIt looks like a flying rabbit,\u201d she said, pointing at one blob.\n Bik found no problems.  PLOS One has \u201ccleaned up their act a lot,\u201d she said. The journal\u2019s publisher employs a team of three editors who handle matters of publication ethics, including Bik\u2019s cases. Renee Hoch, one of the editors, told me that the process of investigation, which entails obtaining original, raw images from the authors, and, in some cases, requesting input from external reviewers, usually takes four to six months per case. Hoch said that of the first hundred and ninety or so of Bik\u2019s cases that the team had resolved, forty-six per cent required corrections, around forty-three per cent were retracted, and another nine per cent received \u201cexpressions of concern.\u201d In only two of the resolved papers was nothing amiss. \u201cIn the vast majority of cases, when she raises an issue and we look into it, we agree with her assessment,\u201d Hoch said.\n Could Bik be replaced with a computer? There are arguments for the idea that automated image-scanning could be both faster and more accurate, with fewer false positives and false negatives. Hany Farid, a computer scientist and  photo-forensic expert at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed that scientific misconduct is a troubling issue, but was uneasy about individual image detectives using their own judgment to publicly identify suspect images. \u201cOne wants to tread fairly lightly\u201d when professional reputations are on the line, he told me. Farid\u2019s reservations spring partly from a general skepticism about the accuracy of the human eye. While our visual systems excel at many tasks, such as recognizing faces, they aren\u2019t always good at other kinds of visual discrimination. Farid sometimes provides court testimony in cases involving doctored images; his lab has designed algorithms for detecting faked photographs of everyday scenes, and they are eighty-to-ninety-five-per-cent accurate, with false positives in roughly one in a hundred cases. Judging by courtroom standards, he is unimpressed by Bik\u2019s stats and would prefer a more rigorous assessment of her accuracy. \u201cYou can audit the algorithms,\u201d Farid said. \u201cYou can\u2019t audit her brain.\u201d He would like to see similar systems designed and validated for identifying faked or altered scientific images.\n A few commercial services currently offer specialized software for checking scientific images, but the programs aren\u2019t designed for large-scale, automated use. Ideally, a program would extract images from a scientific paper, then rapidly check them against a huge database, detecting copies or manipulations. Last year, several major scientific publishers, including Elsevier, Springer Nature, and EMBO Press, convened a  working group to flesh out how editors might use such systems to pre-screen manuscripts. Efforts are under way\u2014some funded by the O.R.I.\u2014to create powerful machine-learning algorithms to do the job. But it\u2019s harder than one might think. Daniel Acu\u00f1a, a computer scientist at Syracuse University, told me that such programs need to be trained on and tested against large data sets of published scientific images for which the \u201cground truth\u201d is known: Doctored or not? A group in Berlin, funded by Elsevier, has been slowly building such a  database, using images from retracted papers; some algorithm developers have also turned to Bik, who has shared her set of flawed papers with them.\n Bik told me that she would welcome effective automated image-scanning systems, because they could find far more cases than she ever could. Still, even if an automated platform could identify problematic images, they would have to be reviewed by people. A computer can\u2019t recognize when research images have been duplicated for appropriate reasons, such as for reference purposes. And, if bad images are already in the published record, someone must hound journal editors or institutions until they take action. Around forty thousand papers have received comments on PubPeer, and, for the vast majority, \u201cthere\u2019s absolutely no response,\u201d Boris Barbour, a neuroscientist in Paris who is a volunteer organizer for PubPeer, told me. \u201cEven when somebody is clearly guilty of a career of cheating, it\u2019s quite hard to see any justice done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scales are clearly tilted in the other direction.\u201d Some journals are actively complicit in generating spurious papers; a former journal editor I spoke with described working at a highly profitable, low-tier publication that routinely accepted \u201cunbelievably bad\u201d manuscripts, which were riddled with plagiarism and blatantly faked images. Editors asked authors to supply alternative images, then published the studies after heavy editing. \u201cI think what she\u2019s showing is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d the ex-editor said, of Bik.\n Some university research-integrity officers point out, with chagrin, that whistle-blowing about research misconduct on social media can tip off the scientists involved, allowing them to destroy evidence ahead of an investigation. But Bik and other watchdogs find that posting to social media creates more pressure for journals and institutions to respond. Some observers worry that the airing of dirty laundry risks undermining public faith in science. Bik believes that most research is trustworthy, and regards her work as a \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 22:53:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday urged Israelis to avoid nonessential international travel amid an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the country.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not currently an order, it\u2019s a request,\u201d Bennett told reporters at Ben-Gurion International Airport, following a tour of its testing sites and a consultation with Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked and Transportation Minister Merav Michaeli.\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t need to go abroad, do not go abroad,\u201d said Bennett, noting that the recent coronavirus outbreak in Binyamina was traced to a family who returned from Cyprus, which is not considered a high-risk country.\n    The prime minister also announced that masks will become mandatory again within the airport, and encouraged Israelis to resume wearing facemasks indoors. Israel lifted its indoor mask mandate last week.\n \u201cEveryone who enters the airport must wear a mask from the moment they arrive until the moment they leave,\u201d said Bennett.\n     Bennett, who took office last week, said the new government will reestablish the coronavirus cabinet, which will assist in making future COVID-related decisions. The prime minister said the government is working \u201cto cut off\u201d the extra-contagious Delta variant \u201cearly and decisively.\u201d\n   He also reiterated that every person who enters Israel will have to undergo a PCR test, and said the number of testing sites at the airport have recently been increased from 30 to 70.\n In addition to the mask mandate at the airport, Bennett recommended that people don masks in all indoor areas.\n      \u201cIf the numbers go up, to over 100 new cases for several days, it will be an order,\u201d Bennett said, noting that he will instruct ministers and public leaders to resume wearing masks indoors immediately.\n He also warned of possible \u201csignificant changes in entering and exiting Israel\u201d once the coronavirus cabinet has reconvened and studied the current situation.\n   Concerns are rising in Israel over the spread of the new Delta variant, which is believed to be responsible for 70% of the new cases in the country in recent weeks. There were 125 new COVID cases  confirmed on Monday, a figure more than double the number detected the day before, and the highest daily caseload since April 20.\n The Health Ministry is also expected to announce the return of the mask mandate in hospitals, health clinics, old age homes, and in schools where there is a COVID outbreak, according to Channel 12 News.\n Chezy Levy, director general of the Health Ministry, told the Ynet news site on Tuesday that it is \u201cwise to wear a mask\u201d in crowded areas, including aboard public transportation.\n Earlier Tuesday, the Defense Ministry said it would assist in setting up a new COVID testing area at the airport to help handle the increased demand.\n     \u201cThe defense establishment will continue to aid the health system in any national mission it requires,\u201d said Defense Minister Benny Gantz. \u201cThe war on coronavirus is not behind us, but with determined and rapid action, we will maintain a low level of infection and we will win this fight as well.\u201d\n Horowitz said the Health Ministry will \u201csignificantly strengthen the testing system at Ben-Gurion Airport\u2026 in order to prevent the formation of unreasonable lines.\u201d\n Last Friday, thousands of Israelis were  allowed to exit the airport without taking a mandatory COVID test due to overcrowding at the station. The government has since  vowed to step up testing capabilities and increase the enforcement of quarantine for those who require it.\n   Israel lifted its indoor mask mandate on June 15, but the mayors of Modiin and Binyamina  reimposed the mandate in schools in the two cities, after local outbreaks. Kfar Saba also reinstated masks in schools in the city on Tuesday, after several positive COVID cases among students.\n One-third of new cases of COVID in Israel are believed to be among vaccinated individuals, according to Health Ministry figures. Ran Balicer, the head of Israel\u2019s COVID advisory panel,  said the figures are not surprising or alarming.\n He also noted that there have been no severe COVID cases reported so far among those infected.\n Coronavirus czar Nachman Ash described the recent coronavirus outbreaks at several schools as localized upticks, and not a sign that Israel could be facing a fresh wave of infections.\n \u201cThis is a local and not a general outbreak, whose source is primarily from abroad,\u201d Ash told Channel 13 News. \u201cHowever, the issue of quarantine [after travel] isn\u2019t being done properly \u2014 people aren\u2019t strict about it and therefore we see contagion.\u201d\n On Monday, the Health Ministry said it would begin a greater push to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds and officially recommended that they do so. While that particular age group has been eligible for several weeks, until now, the ministry stopped short of issuing an official recommendation, and the number of vaccinations among teenagers has remained low.\n In his statement on Monday, Bennett called on anyone over the age of 12 to get vaccinated as soon as possible, and noted that Israel\u2019s stockpile of vaccines will be expiring in the coming months, and therefore teenagers should make appointments soon. The prime minister warned the teenagers to get their first shots before July 9.\n     I\u2019ll tell you the truth: Life here in Israel isn\u2019t always easy. But it&#39;s full of beauty and meaning.\n  I&#39;m proud to work at The Times of Israel alongside colleagues who pour their hearts into their work day in, day out, to capture the complexity of this extraordinary place.\n  I believe our reporting sets an important tone of honesty and decency that&#39;s essential to understand what&#39;s really happening in Israel.

SOC 2 is a certification used to show that a company can store customer data in the cloud securely, but the process is notoriously complex and can take months to complete \u2014 and you have to do it all over again every year. That\u2019s particularly burdensome for startups and smaller firms.\n Drata says it can get companies SOC 2-compliant faster and keep them in compliance for longer by integrating with popular business tools and cloud services to get a better picture of a company\u2019s security posture.\n Now with a new round of $25 million at Series A in the bank, Drata said it\u2019s expanding its compliance platform to also include ISO 27001, another  core security standard used all over the world to help companies protect their systems and safeguard data.\n The round landed six months after  its $3.2 million seed round in January, and was led by GGV Capital, with participation from Silicon Valley CISO Investors, Okta Ventures, Cowboy Ventures, Leaders Fund, and SV Angel.\n Drata CEO and co-founder Adam Markowitz told TechCrunch that the company is growing on average 100% month-over-month since it launched out of stealth and is serving hundreds of customers, including three-person startups to publicly traded companies.\n The startup joins several other companies in the compliance space. Secureframe  raised $18 million at Series A in March to offer SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications.

 -0.18%  is investing\u00a0in startup investing platform Atom Finance, in a bet by the Japanese conglomerate that a retail trading boom is here to stay.\n  Atom Finance, founded in 2018, lets individuals track investments and research holdings. In addition to SoftBank,\u00a0existing investors\u00a0General\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0and Base Partners also took part\u00a0in the latest $28 million funding round. The investment\u00a0values\u00a0Atom at around $150 million, said a person familiar with the matter.\n  Atom was founded by Eric Shoykhet, who covered financial services firms\u00a0and other sectors\u00a0from 2015 to 2018 at hedge fund Governors Lane. He believed falling trading costs would prompt more individual investors to trade. This meant that they would need  new kinds of tools to guide them.\n    In 2019,\u00a0major brokerages  launched no-commission\u00a0stock\u00a0trading\u00a0to stave off the threat from digital upstart Robinhood Markets Inc. Now,\u00a0all kinds of\u00a0brokerages compete against each other for retail traders with free trading having become a booming business. It has been particularly transformative in the past year as more investors with\u00a0free time during the pandemic have wielded\u00a0 growing power over markets,\u00a0sending meme stocks such as  GameStop  soaring.\n    Atom\u00a0isn\u2019t a trading platform but it has still been a\u00a0beneficiary. Hundreds of thousands of users have signed up since its platform launched in 2019. Paying customers increased in the past year, though the firm declined to provide exact details about user numbers.\n  \u201cWe think a lot of that increase in investor participation in markets is here to stay,\u201d said Mr. Shoykhet, 29 years old. \u201cThe narrative we never bought into was that active investing was dead.\u201d\n  Mr. Shoykhet hopes his firm will grow as individuals seek cheap tools to help them invest. A full Atom subscription goes for $9.99 a month, a fraction of how much a Bloomberg Terminal costs.\n    SoftBank\u00a0led the Series B funding round in Atom through\u00a0a $5 billion fund it created to focus on Latin America. It reflects\u00a0SoftBank\u2019s\u00a0wager that the rise of individuals in U.S. markets will take off in that region too.\n    This year, Atom pursued a deal\u00a0on its own\u00a0to provide products for Banco Inter, a digital bank in Brazil that SoftBank\u2019s Latin America fund has also invested in. Shu Nyatta, managing partner for SoftBank\u2019s Latin America fund,\u00a0said SoftBank\u00a0later\u00a0introduced Atom to other portfolio companies\u00a0in hopes of\u00a0fueling similar deals.\n  \u201cThe whole idea is to bring high-quality data to people who wouldn\u2019t have access to them,\u201d he said.\n  Mr. Nyatta said he was drawn to Mr. Shoykhet\u2019s opportunism and willingness to make Latin America a strategic focus. Mr. Shoykhet recently moved to Miami and is planning to open an office there, in part to make it easier to do business with Latin America.\n  But there is one thing Atom Finance isn\u2019t planning to do for now: It doesn\u2019t want to become a trading application.\n  Mr. Shoykhet is skeptical about many e-brokerages\u2019 practice of routing trades to big trading firms in exchange for payments.\u00a0The industry  has defended this practice,\u00a0known as payment for order flow, arguing that it lowers the cost of trading for individuals. Others argue it hurts investors as firms will encourage heavy trading by users to maximize profits\u2014even if those investors take too much risk.\n  \u201cWe don\u2019t think it has users\u2019 best interests in mind,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 22:05:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4f30\u4ef7,softbank", "title":

", "note_en": "The PipeWire project is slowly getting popularas it matures. Its documentation is still relatively sparse but is graduallygrowing. However, it\u2019s always a good idea to have people from outsidethe project try to grasp and explain it to others in their own words,reiterating ideas, seeing them from their own perspective.\n In a  previouspostsI went over the generic audio stack on Unix and had a section mentioningPipeWire. Unfortunately, because at the time I didn\u2019t find enough docsand couldn\u2019t wrap my head around some concepts, I think I didn\u2019t dojustice to the project and might have even confused some parts. In this post I\u2019ll try to explain PipeWire in the most simple way possible,to make it accessible to others that want to start following this coolnew project but that don\u2019t know where to start. It\u2019s especially importantto do this to open the door for more people to join in and follow thecurrent development, which is happening at a fast pace.\n Disclaimer: I\u2019d like to preface this by saying that I\u2019m not a developerinvolved in the project, only an internet traveler that got interested. Imight still have made mistakes and do not cover everything, so be sure toleave comments or emails so that I can correct or add info.  PS: If you like deep dives and similar discussions then check the nixers community, it\u2019s full of people that loveto do that.  PPS: I\u2019ve use a similar name for thisarticle as the fabulous  PulseAudio Under theHood but Idon\u2019t think I go in as much details as the author did for PulseAudio.\n    PipeWire is a media processing graph, this might not ring a bell so letme rephrase. PipeWire is a daemon that provides the equivalent of shellpipes but for media: audio and video.\n What lives in this graph are nodes that can represent multiple things,from real devices such as headsets or webcams, to virtual ones such asaudio filters. These nodes have ports, and these ports can be linked together, themedia flowing from the first node\u2019s  source in the direction of the nextnode\u2019s  sink. What happens in each node is up to them and the interfacesor functionalities they provide.\n Practically, the nodes, links, ports, and others, are all differentobjects extending a basic type, and live in this graph. These objectsdon\u2019t necessarily have to be media-related either, they can do a lot ofother things. We\u2019ll see that they use a special type system,plugin system, and marshalling format/storage.\n All to say, that PipeWire is a graph,  \u201cit\u2019s mechanism and not policy\u201d. That means that to create and interact with that graph we need anotherpiece of software. The standard way is to rely on what PipeWire callsa  session manager or policy manager. The role of such software is tocreate and manage the entities in the graph depending on the environment,such as when a device is plugged in, or a restore volume policy is set,or permissions needs to be checked before allowing a client to accessa device.\n Currently, there are two implementations of such session manager:the default one called  pipewire-media-session, and a work-in-progress,but extremely promising and interesting one, called  WirePlumber. Yet, you can choose to build your own session management workflow byrelying on external tools to manage what is in the PipeWire graph.\n Let\u2019s cut this short, and have a look at how to run PipeWire. Get it from your package manager, and do the following in a terminal.\n    In some cases, as we\u2019ll see from pipewire configuration, you might notneed to execute the second command, because pipewire could be set toautomatically start  pipewire-media-session. Try a  ps beforehand just to be sure.\n Still, doing the above won\u2019t get you anywhere if no application canspeak with PipeWire \u2014 only a handful do at the moment. Furthermore,PipeWire GUIs and toolings are still lacking, as we\u2019ll see. That is why, PipeWire offers three compatibility layers: with  ALSAthrough a PCM device, with  PulseAudio through pipewire-pulse server,and with  Jack through the  pw-jack command.\n To make sure you got the ALSA compatibility, check /etc/alsa/conf.d/50-pipewire.conf which should define a pcmfor pipewire, often created when installing the  pipewire-alsapackage. Then check if this has become the default pcm bydumping ALSA configuration through  alsactl dump-cfg or aconfdump and verifying the pcm.default entry. However, it doesn\u2019t have to if you still want to relyon the PulseAudio shim, in that case it would be  type pulse.\n For the PulseAudio layer, which allows using PulseAudio tools withPipeWire, install  pipewire-pulse and start it. Your distribution packagemight even start it automatically along with the session manager throughthe init/service manager.\n Finally, for jack, install the  pipewire-jack package and issue pw-jack before any jack related command and they will automaticallyuse PipeWire. For example:\n  Additionally, for the video functionality you should installa desktop portal, which is a dbus service implementing the xdg-desktop-portalspecifications and whose job is to check if the client requesting accessto the video is allowed. There are many such software:\n  You should be familiar with these if you are running a Wayland compositoras this is the only way to access video on Wayland (webcam, screensharing, screenshot).\n Here you go, PipeWire is running! Yet, there\u2019s a lot more to see than that, such as how to configurePipeWire and the session manager, how to write software that relies onPipeWire, the thinking that goes into it, how to manipulate the graphand rely on tools, and plenty of other examples.\n  The best way to understand the ideas behind PipeWire is to take a lookat GStreamer, which it inspires itself from and which is maintained bythe same lead developer (a nice and welcoming person). Even though the author  wants to make the comparison with JACKinstead.You could take a look at JACK and extract the concepts you want from it,but we\u2019ll go for GStreamer in this article.\n GStreamer plays around the concept of a pipeline created from objectsadded in a \u201cbin\u201d, its version of a graph. Like PipeWire, media flows fromone end to another. In Gstreamer\u2019s world, instead of nodes there areGstElements, instead of ports there are pads attached to GstElements,and links are connections between pads.\n The resemblance goes deeper, GStreamer relies on GObject, which, ifyou are unaware, is a C framework/programming model to make developmenteasier. It allows it to do multiple things such as registering forasynchronous events (called signals) that are triggered by GstElementspresent in the pipeline. GObject also has a main loop management, a typesystem, introspection mechanisms, and other goodies.\n GStreamer offers different types of GstElements as plugins createdthrough \u201cfactories\u201d. In fact, these are GObjects extending thecommon GstElement type to provide useful functionalities. There\u2019s alist of them available in the GStreamer documentation. For example aasink. Some are for videos, some for audio, some for logging, some for conversionbetween format and negotiation, etc..\n These elements can also be introspected on the command line via the gst-inspect-1.0 tool. This makes it wonderfully easy to program withGStreamer.\n Similarly, PipeWire has plugins that extend a basic node elementtype. However, it doesn\u2019t rely on GObject/GstElement but on its ownsimpler plugin system, appropriately named SPA (Simple Plugin API). Italso has factories, a loop management system, asynchronous events, anda message passing format called POD (Plain Old Data). Think of PipeWire as a simpler Gstreamer running as a daemon, with a fullycontrollable loop, and that relies on a session manager to automaticallycreate the graph/pipeline based on streams and devices that appear.\n Yet, PipeWire is still missing documentation and introspection tools asexcellent as GStreamer. Plugins are barely documented yet. I have to say,GStreamer is a really well-done project and I hope that PipeWire willsoon be the same.\n     GStreamer is still relevant with PipeWire, as GStreamer can nowintegrate with it. \u201cGStreamer is intended to be a Swiss army knife ofmultimedia\u201d. New plugins for PipeWire are available under the names:\n  Learning about GStreamer is a great way to better understand PipeWire,at least it was for me.\n  The GObject, the GLib Object System, is well-known and battle-tested,but it\u2019s not what PipeWire uses because of its heaviness. PipeWire relieson SPA and POD. So what are SPA (Simple Plugin API) and POD (Plain Old Data)?\n  POD, the Plain Old Data (not to be confused with  Perl\u2019s PlainOld Documentation) is ageneric data container format for marshalling/unmarshalling,serialization/unserialization, storage, andtransfer. It\u2019s the usual flat  passive datastructure.\n Think of it as yet another format, similar to XML, JSON, ASN.1,protobuf, and others. It inspires itself from formats such as  D-busVariantand  LV2 Atom.\n Practically, it\u2019s an LTV (Length-Type-Value) format, thus usingoctet-counting framing, where the length and type are fixed 32bits valuesand the frames are always 8 bytes aligned. So padding is often added tovalues that don\u2019t align on it. ( NB: Framing refers to the concept of startand end of value, how to delimit.) The type system, what the 32 bits  T refers to, is called the SPA typesystem and has compound/container and basic/primitive types. These rangefrom containers such as a array, struct, object, sequence, pointer,file descriptor, choice, to primitives such as bool, int, string, etc.. The advantage of such format is that it\u2019s an \u201cas-is\u201d format, it candirectly be transferred on the network, read from memory, stored on thestack or on disk without extra marshalling.\n NB: If you want to know more about protocol/format design in generalrefer to  RFC 3117.\n The POD library wasn\u2019t designed to be specifically used for PipeWire,it can be used in any other project, though the question remains of whyuse this format instead of another. The library is a small header-only C librarywithout dependencies, which makes it a breeze to test with. I\u2019ve published an  example of itsusagebased on the  officialtutorial but let\u2019s still go over the general aspect of it.\n The best documentation for POD is to consult the headers themselves, asa lot of helpers aren\u2019t documented anywhere else. You can usually findthem in  /usr/include/spa/pod/ or  /usr/include/spa-&lt;version&gt;/pod/(just be sure it\u2019s the latest version). It comes bundled inthe same directory as SPA as it relies on the type ID system in /usr/include/spa/utils/type.h and  defs.h.\n The pod structure  struct spa_pod is defined in  /spa/pod/pod.h alongwith the primitive and container values. The builder to construct them arefound in  /spa/pod/builder.h, while the parser is in  /spa/pod/parser.h,and the manipulation can be done with helpers in  /spa/pod/iter.h, /spa/pod/filter.h, and others.\n Practically, to create a pod we initialize any part of memory, be it inthe heap or stack, and use a builder helper to initialize it. Then wehave to rely on a frame to set the start of a container object and itsend, basically setting the final size of the object (LTV as we said)when we\u2019re done. The frame acts as a sort of push and pop of value onthe memory segment we chose.\n Here\u2019s a taste of what it looks like, you can consult  myexample,the official docs, or the headers directly to know more. Compilation should be as simple as  cc pod-test.c -o pod-test.\n We define any sort of storage, here 256B on the stack and tell the podbuilder we\u2019ll use it to store pods.\n  We can then define a frame for a container object, here a simple struct,but it could be objects (key/value, called properties which also havetheir own IDs) or other complex types.\n    Finally, we close the frame to say we are done with the struct, and itreturns the  struct spa_pod basic type which can later be casted toits appropriate type.\n   length = 00000020 = 32type = 0000000e = 14 = SPA_TYPE_Structvalue =\tlength = 00000004 = 4\ttype = 00000004 = SPA_TYPE_Int\tvalue = 00000005 = 5\t_padding = 00000000 (always align to 8 bytes)\tlength = 00000004 = 4\ttype = 00000006 = SPA_TYPE_Float\tvalue = 40490e56 = 3.1415\t_padding = 00000000 (always align to 8 bytes)\n The types can be found in  /spa/utils/type.h and others files. We canalso notice the padding for alignment, which was automatically added bythe builder.\n Once we have a pod of a specific type created, we can handle it withrelated helpers. In the  iter.h header we can find ways to loop over struct spa_pod_struct or ways to verify that a pod is indeed a struct.\n struct spa_pod *entry;SPA_POD_STRUCT_FOREACH(example_struct, entry) {\tprintf(&#34;field type:%d\\n&#34;, entry-&gt;type);\t// two ways to get the value, casting or using spa_pod_get_..\tif (spa_pod_is_int(entry)) {\t\tint32_t ival;\t\tspa_pod_get_int(entry, &amp;ival);\t\tprintf(&#34;found int, pod_int: %d\\n&#34;, ival);\t}\tif (spa_pod_is_float(entry)) {\t\tstruct spa_pod_float *pod_float = (struct spa_pod_float*)entry;\t\tprintf(&#34;found float, pod_float: %f\\n&#34;, pod_float-&gt;value);\t}}\n As you noticed,  struct spa_pod are generic and only contain thefirst two 32bits value of a pod, namely size and type. Thus, we have tointerrogate its type to find out what it actually is, and then cast itmanually or using helpers such as  spa_pod_get_* found in  iter.h.\n Instead of doing that, we can instead rely on an  spa_pod_parser andother helpers to do the validation and inspection of raw data (see in iter.h  spa_pod_from_data for example).\n Yet, it would be annoying to manually check values when you only wantto glance at its format. That\u2019s why debugging functions are present in /spa/debug/pod.h. The  spa_debug_pod_value is particularly usefulto print what\u2019s in a pod. We could also use  /spa/utils/json.hand  /spa/utils/ansi.h to print structures as json, like is shown here, but there\u2019s no simple function to do that yet.\n There\u2019s a lot more to POD than this, it\u2019s a whole object format, butlet\u2019s stop and move to SPA.\n  While POD is just about data representation, SPA is aboutfunctionality. SPA, the Simple Plugin API, is a header-only and nodependencies framework that gives the ability to load libraries thathave a specific format, enumerating factories, creating them, and theinterfaces they provide that can be introspected and used, all at runtime.\n Like POD, it is not necessarily tied to PipeWire, but can be usedanywhere, though PipeWire got its own plugins using SPA.\n The objects that are created by the factories in the SPA have a specificformat, often internally relying on POD, and the SPA factory interfaceslet us know the functionalities associated with them.\n Practically, plugins using SPA take the form of dynamically loadablelibraries (.so), usually found under  /usr/lib/spa/, or the env SPA_PLUGIN_PATH, and opened on the fly using  dlopen(3). The SPA libs have at least one public symbol  spa_handle_factory_enum,defined in  /spa/support/plugin.h, which is loaded as follows.\n  I\u2019ve also written a  simpleexampleto show SPA usage, but let\u2019s review the mechanism quickly asthis is important to grasp PipeWire configuration. Compiling should also be as simple as  cc test-spa.c -ldl -o test-spa.\n A plugin is composed of a list of factories, and in each factory we havea list of interfaces available. The idea is that factories are a setof methods used around a struct of a specific type, from its creation,to different interactions with it. Interfaces are about anything thatcan be bundled together.\n Factories have well-known names and the interfaces in them have namestoo, they are defined in  /spa/utils/names.h and the interfaces names arestored in the plugin header themselves in the form  SPA_TYPE_INTERFACE_*. Factories also have additional information such as version, author,description, and more.\n This is what we need to know to use the library after loadingit. Yet, we have to consult the header files and the library location /usr/lib/spa-&lt;version&gt; to know which factories are currently available andhow to use them. In that library directory, folders are present displayingthe categories of plugins, most of them related to PipeWire. If we take a look at  support/libspa-support.so, we see that it relatesto the  support headers we got. We can grep on  SPA_TYPE_INTERFACE_to find the headers that have plugins in them to be sure. Let\u2019s see support/log.h as an example.\n The factory name is  SPA_NAME_SUPPORT_LOG and the only interface definedis  SPA_TYPE_INTERFACE_Log. Internally, we see that all plugins usingSPA define two things: a struct containing a  struct spa_interface andanother struct containing the methods related to that interface along withthe version, additionally it can define events and callbacks. If you\u2019recurious  struct spa_interface is defined in  /spa/utils/hook.h. However,the inner workings are not important, what\u2019s important is that we cantake a look at which functions are in an interface which dictates whatwe can do with the plugin.\n A series of command line tools starting with  spa- are present tointeract with the plugins. One in particular called  spa-inspect canbe used to dump the factories and interfaces present in a .so file. Yet,it\u2019s not very solid and doesn\u2019t confer that much information on whatwe can do with the plugins.\n   Thus, after loading the  .so and getting the  enum_func function,we can loop over the factories, find the name we are interested in,then loop over its interfaces to see if it has the one we want, and getan instance of the factory to use it.\n uint32_t i;const struct spa_handle_factory *factory = NULL;for (i = 0;;) {\tif (enum_func(&amp;factory, &amp;i) &lt;= 0)\t\tbreak;\tprintf(&#34;factory name: %s, version: %d\\n&#34;,\t\t\tfactory-&gt;name,\t\t\tfactory-&gt;version);\tif (strcmp(factory-&gt;name, SPA_NAME_SUPPORT_LOG) == 0) {\t\tconst struct spa_interface_info *info = NULL;\t\tuint32_t index = 0;\t\t// get interface at position 0\t\tint interface_available = \t\t\tspa_handle_factory_enum_interface_info(\t\t\tfactory,\t\t\t&amp;info,\t\t\t&amp;index);\t\tif (strcmp(info-&gt;type, SPA_TYPE_INTERFACE_Log) == 0) {\t\t\t// allocate a handle (struct) pointing\t\t\t// to this factory&#39;s interfaces\t\t\tsize_t size = spa_handle_factory_get_size(\t\t\t\tfactory, NULL);\t\t\tstruct spa_handle *handle = calloc(1, size);\t\t\tspa_handle_factory_init(factory, handle,\t\t\t\tNULL, // info\t\t\t\tNULL, // support\t\t\t\t0 // n_support\t\t\t);\t\t\t// fetch the interface by name from the factory handle\t\t\tvoid *iface;\t\t\tint interface_exists =\t\t\t\tspa_handle_get_interface(\t\t\t\t\thandle,\t\t\t\t\tSPA_TYPE_INTERFACE_Log,\t\t\t\t\t&amp;iface);\t\t\t// finally get something useful by casting it\t\t\tstruct spa_log *log = iface;\t\t\t// use the methods in the interface of the factory\t\t\tspa_log_warn(log, &#34;Hello World!&#34;);\t\t\tspa_log_info(log, &#34;version: %i&#34;, log-&gt;iface.version);\t\t\t// clear the handle to the factory\t\t\tspa_handle_clear(handle);\t\t}\t}}\n  Get the name of the first interface (though we can loop over spa_handle_factory_enum_interface_info until it returns 0) and matchby name.\n  Allocate a  struct spa_handle * which is a pointer to all interfacesin the factory, a way to construct it. (We have to fetch its size todo that, I\u2019m sure there could be a better helper to make this easierin the future). The factory creation could possibly take parameters.\n  Get our interface from the created factory using spa_handle_get_interface, then cast it to the struct we talked aboutearlier  struct spa_log.\n There are a lot of plugins and different ways to use them. Some interfacesare asynchronous and use callbacks through registered event handlersand hooks, some are synchronous.\n This is a general idea of what SPA is.

Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation. Back then, Buffett owned 474,998 Berkshire A shares. Today, he said he owns 238,624 shares, worth about $100 billion.\n  &#34;Today is a milestone for me,&#34; Buffett said in a statement. &#34;In 2006, I pledged to distribute all of my Berkshire Hathaway shares \u2014 more than 99% of my net worth \u2014 to philanthropy. With today&#39;s $4.1 billion distribution, I&#39;m halfway there.&#34;\n Buffett&#39;s resignation as Gates Foundation trustee comes as the charitable organization faces a tumultuous time with the divorce of its two founders.\n &#34;For years I have been a trustee \u2014 an inactive trustee at that \u2014 of only one recipient of my funds, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMG). I am now resigning from that post, just as I have done at all corporate boards other than Berkshire&#39;s,&#34; Buffett said. &#34;The CEO of BMG is Mark Suzman, an outstanding recent selection who has my full support. My goals are 100% in sync with those of the foundation, and my physical participation is in no way needed to achieve these goals.&#34;\n Bill Gates, co-founder and former CEO of\u00a0 Microsoft, and his wife, Melinda French Gates,  announced their divorce in May. The couple along with Buffett were creators of the\u00a0 Giving Pledge, a program that requires participants to give away more than half of their wealth.\n Buffett said his 16 annual contributions to the five foundations over the years were worth $41 billion when disbursed. Buffett is Berkshire&#39;s largest shareholder, owning about 39% of the Class A shares, according to FactSet.\n  Berkshire A shares have rebounded more than 20% to hit a record high in 2021 as many of the conglomerate&#39;s business recovered better than expected from the pandemic hit.\n &#34;I&#39;m optimistic. Though naysayers abound \u2014 as they have throughout my life \u2014 America&#39;s best days most certainly lie ahead,&#34; Buffett said. &#34;Philanthropy will continue to pair human talent with financial resources. So, too, will business and government. Each force has its particular strengths and weaknesses. Combined, they will make the world a better place \u2014 a much better place \u2014 for future generations.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-23 22:04:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

briefly go over a variation on this theme being practiced by trolls now: Copyright Trolling!\n One example of Copyright Trolling could be, for example, taking out thousands of copyrights on the floor plans of houses. (\u201cOoo! This one has a living room connected to bedrooms! This one has a kitchen next to a dining room! This one has a window in the front door so people can see though it!\u201d)\n Then, once you\u2019ve copyrighted a few thousand floor plans, you freely send out them out to construction companies (now they\u2019re likely to be used!)\u2026 and then start trolling the internet, looking for anyone that has actually used some variation of the vague plans you sent out.. and sue them for stealing your idea! Easy money: Just sketch out a few thousand floor plans of what you think a house might look like, send \u2018em out, and then start filing the lawsuits if anyone builds a house close to what you sketched!\n  Let\u2019s look at a company called Design Basics. (  https://www.designbasics.com ,  https://www.facebook.com/DesignBasics )\n   \u201cWomen-centric\u201d floor plans\u2026 748 of them\u2026 the \u201c Cotter\u201d\u2026 this one has a kitchen connected to a dining room!\n The \u201c Shelton Farm\u201d\u2026 this one \u00a0 has a kitchen connected to a dining room!\n The \u201c Crandall\u201d\u2026 Oooo! This one has a kitchen connected to a dining room! Who could have thought of that?\n And this list goes on, and on, and on. These floor-plans are vague because they\u2019re NOT architectural designs! Nobody could actually BUILD a house with just these plans! They\u2019re just basic floor plans that anyone could dream up and sketch on a napkin!\n So, once Design Basics has dreamed up a few THOUSAND vague and simple floor plans\u2026 they post them at their web site, and send them in mass mailings to the National Association of Homebuilders.\n Now, with these simple, vague floor-plans (not full architectural drawings!) out there for everyone to see\u2026 they look for someone to actually build a house that has a similar layout, and then jump in with the lawsuit!\n  Each of these cases represents countless hours and dollars that people have been forced to spend to defend their right to use a common and obvious floor plan\u2026 or face summary judgement and be forced to turn over money to a copyright troll. Imagine running a business whose goal is extract money from people, ruining their business and lives, based on such flimsy work as vague floor-plan sketches.\n  As it turns out Patrick Carmichael and Myles Sherman purchased Design Basics as an \u2018investment\u2019 and are now using lawsuits as their core business model (  http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2021/D04-23/C:19-2716:J:Sykes:aut:T:fnOp:N:2694335:S:0 page 4). In 2014 Paul Foresman, working for Design Basics, emailed Patrick Carmichael with the subject line \u201cA gift for you\u201d\u2026 the \u201cgift\u201d being that someone had perhaps built a house with a floor plan similar to one of the plans that Design Basics dreamed up.\n Remember, in the United States, we are not allowed to sue for PROFIT: A lawsuit is designed to  recoup damages that have been done to a person\u2026 not act as a \u201cgift\u201d, like a winning lottery ticket.\n   I used to believe that while PATENTS (where you claim to own AN ENTIRE IDEA) were non-sensical, but COPYRIGHTS should be safe from this type of behavior, since they protect an ACTUAL SPECIFIC WORK\u2026 but as we see in cases like this, even copyrights can be used an an excuse for trolling\u2026 you just need to draw something that is easy and obvious enough that anyone could dream up\u2026 and then claim ownership of that simple drawing for yourself!\n What amazes me is that Design Basics (  https://www.designbasics.com ,  https://www.facebook.com/DesignBasics ) is still in business\u2026 I think the people that go to their site just don\u2019t fully understand who they are actually

", "note_en": "Counterfeit packages downloaded roughly 5,000 times from the official Python repository contained secret code that installed cryptomining software on infected machines, a security researcher has found.\n The malicious packages, which were available on the PyPI repository, in many cases used names that mimicked those of legitimate and often widely used packages already available there, Ax Sharma, a researcher at security firm Sonatype  reported. So-called typosquatting attacks succeed when targets accidentally mistype a name such as typing \u201cmplatlib\u201d or \u201cmaratlib\u201d instead of the legitimate and popular package  matplotlib.\n Sharma said he found six packages that installed cryptomining software that would use the resources of infected computers to mine cryptocurrency and deposit it in the attacker\u2019s wallet. All six were published by someone using the PyPI username  nedog123, in some cases as early as April. The packages and download numbers are:\n     The malicious code is contained in the setup.py file of each of these packages. It causes infected computers to use either the  ubqminer or  T-Rex cryptominer to mine digital coin and deposit it in the following address:  0x510aec7f266557b7de753231820571b13eb31b57.\n  PyPI  has been a  frequently abused  repository since 2016 when a college student tricked 17,000 coders into running the sketchy script he posted there. Not that PyPI is abused any more than other repositories are. Last year, packages downloaded thousands of times from  RubyGems installed malware that attempted to intercept Bitcoin payments. Two years before that, someone backdoored a 2-million-user code library hosted in NPM. Sonatpe has  tracked more than 12,000 malicious NPM packages since 2019.\n It&#39;s tempting to think that a fair number of the downloads counted in these events were done automatically and never resulted in computers getting infected, but the college student&#39;s experiment linked above argues otherwise. His counterfeit Python module was executed more than 45,000 times on more than 17,000 separate domains, some belonging to US governmental and military organizations. This kind of promiscuity was never a good idea, but it should be strictly forbidden going forward.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 21:25:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "repos,malice", "title": "Ahoy\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684repos-pypi\u4e2d\u6709\u6076\u610f\u662f\u6700\u88ab\u6ee5\u7528\u7684 ", "title_en": "Ahoy, there\u2019s malice in your repos\u2014PyPI is the latest to be abused", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/counterfeit-pypi-packages-with-5000-downloads-installed-cryptominers/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["repos", "malice"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "56fddda511409f8e405ad9addd9a8e24.jpeg", "infoid": 1067699, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u4e39\uff08AP\uff09 - \u4f26\u52c3\u6717\u68b5\u6c5f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7ed8\u753b\u4e4b\u4e00\u521a\u521a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u3002 \u827a\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5a5a\u59fb\u4f7f\u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u4e39\u7684RIJKSMuseum\u51ed\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u96f7\u59c6\u6717\u727970\u5e74\u540e\u526a\u6389\u4e8670\u5e74\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u201c\u591c\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u201d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002 ", "note_en": "AMSTERDAM (AP) \u2014 One of Rembrandt van Rijn's biggest paintings just got a bit bigger.
