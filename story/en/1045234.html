And Facebook has a lot of challenges right now: the attack on the Capitol was at least partly driven by conspiracy theories and misinformation on social media; all of the  major platforms have banned or restricted Donald Trump, prompting a reckoning about content moderation; the Federal Trade Commission and 48 attorneys general across the US have filed a  major antitrust lawsuit that seeks to break Facebook up entirely; and there is new competition from TikTok, which has taken over Instagram’s relevance to culture in surprising ways.</p><p>亚当·摩塞里（Adam Mosseri）对Facebook，其功能和面临的挑战有广阔的视野。 Facebook现在面临许多挑战：对国会大厦的攻击至少部分是由阴谋论和社交媒体上的错误信息驱动的；所有主要平台都禁止或限制了唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump），这促使人们对内容审核持谨慎态度；美国联邦贸易委员会（Federal Trade Commission）和全美48位检察长已提起重大反托拉斯诉讼，试图将Facebook彻底瓦解。 TikTok发起了一项新竞赛，以惊人的方式接管了Instagram与文化的相关性。</p><p> Mosseri is the guest on this week’s   Decoder . Currently the Facebook executive in charge of Instagram, he started at Facebook over a decade ago as a designer, and he’s held a number of important roles since then — at one point he was responsible for Facebook’s News Feed and the algorithms behind it. He came to Instagram as head of product and then took over the platform when founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left in late 2018.</p><p> Mosseri是本周Decoder的嘉宾。目前是Facebook负责Instagram的高管，他在十年前以一名设计师的身份加入Facebook，此后他担任了许多重要角色-一方面，他负责Facebook的News Feed及其背后的算法。他来到Instagram担任产品主管，然后在创始人凯文·西斯特罗姆（Kevin Systrom）和迈克·克里格（Mike Krieger）于2018年底离开时接手了该平台。</p><p> Mosseri and I talked about all these challenges, but of course we spent most of our time talking about how to run a creative platform like Instagram at scale while keeping users — and democracy — safe. Mosseri told me he agrees with the decision to ban President Trump from Facebook. He’s worried about the fallout and isn’t happy the decision had to be made, but he agrees with it. We also talked about how much responsibility the platforms have for what their ranking algorithms promote, and where he thinks the government should step in and set clear rules.</p><p> 我和Mosseri谈到了所有这些挑战，但是我们当然大部分时间都在谈论如何大规模运行Instagram之类的创意平台，同时又要确保用户和民主的安全。莫塞里告诉我，他同意禁止特朗普总统退出Facebook的决定。他担心会发生的后果，对必须做出决定并不满意，但他对此表示同意。我们还谈到了平台对其排名算法所促进的责任，以及他认为政府应介入并制定明确的规则。</p><p> And, of course, we talked about Instagram as a product. Mosseri told me he’s not yet happy with how the TikTok competitor Reels is doing, and that there are too many video formats on Instagram between Reels, stories, the feed, and IGTV. It sounds like things are going to get simplified this year.</p><p> 而且，当然，我们谈到了Instagram作为产品。 Mosseri告诉我，他对TikTok竞争对手Reels的表现还不满意，而且Instagram在Reels，故事，提要和IGTV之间的视频格式太多。听起来今年情况将得到简化。</p><p> One thing that really jumped out at me about this conversation is how Mosseri is trying to manage a three-part feedback loop: Instagram not only gives people the creative tools to express themselves in new ways, but also a huge distribution platform with access to a massive audience — and that means Instagram also has to police what people share and what it amplifies. Pay attention to how the first half of this conversation is about content moderation and making certain things harder to share, and how the second half is about competing with TikTok and making video easier to create and share. The balance between the two feels like the hardest problem for social platforms to solve in the years to come.</p><p> 关于这次对话，真正让我惊讶的一件事是Mosseri如何设法管理一个由三部分组成的反馈循环：Instagram不仅为人们提供了以新方式表达自己的创意工具，而且还为人们提供了访问庞大的受众群体-这意味着Instagram还必须监管人们共享的内容及其放大的内容。请注意本次对话的前半部分如何进行内容审核和使某些内容难以共享，以及下半部分如何与TikTok竞争并使视频更易于创建和共享。两者之间的平衡似乎是未来几年社交平台最难解决的问题。</p><p>   Social platforms are in the news in a lot of different ways lately, but I like to start by asking people for their decision-making frameworks. You have been at Facebook for 12 years. You’ve had a number of roles there; I’m assuming your framework has evolved over time. You’re now the head of Instagram. Give me a sense of how you make decisions and how that has changed as you’ve moved through your career at Facebook.</p><p>   社交平台最近以许多不同的方式成为新闻，但是我想首先请人们提供他们的决策框架。您已经在Facebook工作了12年。您在那里担任过许多角色；我假设您的框架随着时间的推移而发展。您现在是Instagram的负责人。让我大致了解您如何制定决策，以及随着您在Facebook上的职业生涯而发生的变化。</p><p> I think the first thing to put out there is I try and delegate as many decisions as I can. I think that a risk that anybody who runs a large organization has is becoming a bottleneck for decisions. And the truth is, the breadth of decisions we need to make at Instagram is so wide that there’s no way I can, one, be on top of all of them, and two, actually be deep enough in the details to make really informed or insightful decisions.</p><p> 我认为要提出的第一件事是，我会尽力委托尽可能多的决定。我认为经营大型组织的任何人所面临的风险正在成为决策的瓶颈。事实是，我们在Instagram上需要做出的决策如此广泛，以至于我无法做到，一种方法可以放在所有这些方法之上，而第二种方法实际上要在细节上足够深入，以使他们真正了解情况或有见地的决定。 </p><p> So, first and foremost, I try to delegate. I don’t think I did a particularly good job of that earlier in my career. I was a stereotypical early lead, micromanaging, passionate, hothead type.</p><p>因此，首先，我尝试委托。我认为我职业生涯初期没有做过特别出色的工作。我是一个定型的早期领导者，微观管理，热情洋溢，头脑冷静。</p><p> But for the decisions I do make, I try and make sure I keep top of mind what our values are. I try to make sure I bias towards longer-term thinking. I think it’s really easy to get pulled into a more reactionary capacity. And I try to make sure I think about what Instagram is most focused on. Usually, the two groups that we care about most are young people and creators. So I often try to think through, “Is this decision going to benefit those groups or not?” Because we often put those groups first, whenever we can. So all those things go into making any given decision, but hopefully, I make less and less over time.</p><p> 但是对于我所做的决定，我会尽力确保我们牢记我们的价值观。我试图确保我偏向于长期思考。我认为提高反动能力真的很容易。而且，我尝试确保我考虑Instagram最关注的内容。通常，我们最关心的两个群体是年轻人和创作者。因此，我经常想一想：“这个决定是否会使这些群体受益？”因为只要有可能，我们经常将这些小组放在首位。因此，所有这些事情都可以做出任何给定的决定，但是我希望随着时间的推移，我做的事情会越来越少。</p><p> I’ve been paging through the Barack Obama memoir, and he says that one of the things he learned about being president is that by the time a decision gets to him, it’s an impossible decision. Because if there was a right answer, someone else would’ve made it, somewhere else in the government. But if it gets to him, it means there’s not a good choice, and he’s screwed. Is that how you feel? It seems like that’s what you’re describing, in a more positive way.</p><p> 我一直在翻阅巴拉克·奥巴马（Barack Obama）的回忆录，他说他从总统中学到的一件事是，当决定付诸表决时，这是不可能的决定。因为如果有正确的答案，那么其他人会做到的，在政府的其他地方。但是，如果得到他的认可，那意味着没有一个好选择，而且他被搞砸了。那是你的感觉吗？看来这就是您所描述的，而且更积极。</p><p>  The decisions I make don’t have the same gravity that his did, but when I first became head of Instagram, one of the first things that surprised me was how often a decision would be escalated to me. There would be two people who I deeply trusted, who I thought were both brilliant, and just completely disagreed on something important, and I would end up having to make the call. So yes, I think that the more senior you get, the more likely that the decisions you have to make are really just deciding between what’s the least bad option. They’re almost never easy calls, but that’s the job.</p><p>  我做出的决定没有他做的决定那么重，但是当我第一次成为Instagram负责人时，令我感到惊讶的第一件事就是决定多久会升级一次给我。我有两个我深信不疑的人，我认为他们都很聪明，并且在重要的事情上完全不同意，最终我不得不打电话。所以，是的，我认为您越高级，您做出的决定就越有可能实际上只是在最糟糕的选择之间做出决定。他们几乎从来都不是容易打来的电话，但这就是工作。</p><p> The reason I leapt to the Obama comparison is we often think of Facebook as a state. It’s big. It touches a lot of the people in the world. It has an outsized power, and perceived power, over things that happen. And it’s often easy to think of [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg as a head of state — I think sometimes he carries himself that way. What is your relationship, as the head of Instagram, to the larger “state” of Facebook? Do you think of Instagram as a constituent part of that larger entity, in the way that Illinois is a constituent part of the United States? Or is it more separate?</p><p> 我跳到奥巴马比较的原因是我们经常将Facebook视为一个州。好大它感动了世界上很多人。它对发生的事情具有巨大的力量和感知能力。人们常常容易想到[Facebook首席执行官]马克·扎克伯格（Mark Zuckerberg）是国家元首-我认为有时候他会这样子。作为Instagram的负责人，您与更大的Facebook“州”有什么关系？您是否以伊利诺伊州是美国的组成部分的方式将Instagram视为该较大实体的组成部分？还是更分开？</p><p>  We’re obviously hesitant to liken ourselves to governments for obvious reasons, but I do think there are similar challenges. We have a large group of people, our community or constituency, that relies on us. Different groups have different values. They disagree. And we’re always trying to manage that and be responsive to our community, but also be true to our own values.</p><p>  显然，出于明显的原因，我们不愿将自己比作政府，但我确实认为也存在类似的挑战。我们有一大批依赖我们的人，我们的社区或选区。不同的组具有不同的值。他们不同意。我们一直在努力管理并响应社区，同时也恪守自己的价值观。</p><p> To connect your first and second question, Mark and I would like to move more decisions from us to actual governments. Decisions like what can and cannot be on our platform. So, pick an issue: inciting violence, hate speech, et cetera. It would be great if a lot of these things were covered by broad standards that were agreed upon and set by, not every government and every country around the world, but at least a few for organizations. That would actually make more sense in a lot of ways.</p><p> 为了联系您的第一个和第二个问题，马克和我想将更多决定从我们移交给实际政府。诸如在我们的平台上可以做什么和不能做什么的决定。因此，选择一个问题：煽动暴力，仇恨言论等等。如果其中很多事情都被广泛的标准所涵盖，这不是每个政府和每个国家都同意并制定的，那么至少对于组织而言，这将是一个很好的选择。实际上，从许多方面讲，这将更有意义。 </p><p> But to try to answer your question directly — how does Instagram relate to the broader company? I think maybe you could think of us as a state. It doesn’t quite work because there’s a lot of people who use Instagram and use Facebook, too. And you can’t be in Illinois and in Florida at the same time, but we try and share as much as we can. For instance, on content policy, we have the same rules because it helps us keep more people safe and make less mistakes. To just destroy the analogy, there are some federal laws and rules, and there’s some local laws and rules, and that’s okay.</p><p>但要尝试直接回答您的问题-Instagram与更广泛的公司有何关系？我认为也许您可以将我们视为一个国家。它不太有效，因为有很多人也在使用Instagram和Facebook。您不能同时在伊利诺伊州和佛罗里达州，但是我们会尽力分享。例如，在内容政策上，我们有相同的规则，因为它可以帮助我们保护更多人，减少犯错误。为了破坏类推，有一些联邦法律和法规，还有一些地方法律和法规，没关系。</p><p> We try to share as much as we can because, honestly, the Instagram team is lean and mean, and we want to stay that way, but we want to get as much leverage from the broader company as we can.</p><p> 我们尽力分享尽可能多的信息，因为老实说，Instagram团队精干且刻薄，我们希望保持这种状态，但我们希望从更大的公司中获得最大的影响力。</p><p> Another Facebook company has been in the news this week:   there was a big controversy with WhatsApp  and its privacy policy changes around messaging. People are unhappy. They’ve delayed the rollout [of the new policy].</p><p> 另一家Facebook公司本周一直在新闻中：WhatsApp引起了很大争议，其隐私政策围绕消息传递而变化。人们不开心。他们推迟了[新政策]的推出。</p><p> Instagram has already merged its messaging with Facebook. How has that gone? Are people reacting to it?</p><p> Instagram已经将其消息传递与Facebook合并。怎么了？人们对此有反应吗？</p><p> Not in the same way. But actually, that’s been going relatively well. To be clear on WhatsApp, they changed their terms of service. I don’t think we effectively communicated what was changing. Privacy did not change in terms of your messages, your personal messages, or your messages between friends.</p><p> 不一样。但实际上，进展相对顺利。为了清楚在WhatsApp上，他们更改了服务条款。我认为我们没有有效地传达正在发生的变化。隐私在您的消息，个人消息或朋友之间的消息方面没有改变。</p><p> The only real substantive change was how data is stored when you message an official business account. So there’s a bunch of misinformation flying around. The irony is not lost on me. It’s a nice, humbling meta moment for us. But I think the real issue wasn’t just that we didn’t communicate well, it was that we didn’t make it clear what the value was in the moment.</p><p> 唯一真正的实质性变化是当您向官方企业帐户发送消息时如何存储数据。因此，到处都是一堆错误信息。具有讽刺意味的是，我没有迷失方向。对我们来说，这是一个美好而谦卑的元时刻。但是，我认为真正的问题不仅在于我们沟通不畅，还在于我们没有弄清楚当前的价值所在。</p><p> I think that when you make a change, people are going to be nervous, but any large app is going to have to change. Otherwise, they become irrelevant over time. The people who use it a lot and care about it a lot get upset when things change. Change is uncomfortable.</p><p> 我认为，当您进行更改时，人们会感到紧张，但是任何大型应用程序都必须进行更改。否则，它们会随着时间变得无关紧要。当事情发生变化时，经常使用它并非常在意它的人会感到沮丧。改变不舒服。 </p><p> So when you do make a change, you need to make sure that the value is immediately evident. So when we started to merge [Instagram] with Messenger’s experience, it became clear that there was value because suddenly you had all of these features that hadn’t come to Instagram yet. You could reply to messages as opposed to just having a linear chat. You had a bunch of new reactions and customization tools, vanishing mode, et cetera. So there was a lot of evident value. People, by and large, seem to really enjoy it and that’s been great.</p><p>因此，当您进行更改时，需要确保该值立即可见。因此，当我们开始将[Instagram]与Messenger的经验合并时，就很有价值了，因为突然之间您拥有的所有这些功能都还没有加入Instagram。您可以回复消息，而不仅仅是进行线性聊天。您有很多新的反应和自定义工具，消失模式等。因此有很多明显的价值。总的来说，人们似乎很喜欢它，那就太好了。</p><p> Whereas when WhatsApp changed its terms of service this week, it was not clearly articulated and there was no immediately evident value. That’s a bad combination. That’s a recipe for misinformation. So that’s how we got [there]. We’re now scrambling to correct the record.</p><p> 尽管WhatsApp本周更改了服务条款，但并未明确表述，也没有立即明显的价值。这是一个糟糕的组合。那是误传的秘诀。这就是我们得到[那里]的方式。我们现在正努力纠正记录。</p><p> One of the things I’ve actually heard Mark [Zuckerberg] say in the past is [there are] more people at Facebook working on trust and safety than work on Instagram. There’s a bigger team working on policy issues across the company than working on Instagram. How big is Instagram? How many people work at Instagram?</p><p> 我过去确实听过马克[扎克伯格]说过的一件事是[在Facebook上从事信任和安全工作的人比在Instagram上工作的人还多。与在Instagram上工作相比，有更大的团队负责整个公司的政策问题。 Instagram有多大？有多少人在Instagram工作？</p><p> It really depends on how you count, because there’s a lot of people who work on Instagram some of their time, but not all of their time. There’s people who report to me directly. There’s people who report in a dotted line to me — but none of that really matters.</p><p> 这实际上取决于您的计算方式，因为有很多人在Instagram上工作，但有时不是全部。有人直接向我报告。有些人向我虚线汇报，但这些都不重要。</p><p> When I joined Instagram, I wasn’t running it. I was the head of product. I had come from running News Feed at Facebook for a number of years. And I told everybody I was going to be a sponge, and I wasn’t going to push for any change for a couple months while I ramped up and tried to better understand Instagram, the product, the employee base, and the values.</p><p> 当我加入Instagram时，我没有运行它。我是产品负责人。我来自在Facebook上运行News Feed已有很多年了。我告诉所有人，我将成为一块海绵，几个月后我将不再努力进行任何变革，而我努力提升并试图更好地了解Instagram，产品，员工基础和价值观。</p><p> But the one place where I almost immediately broke my promise was on safety and integrity. I was pretty interested in the details, having spent the last couple of years being responsible for fake news on Facebook and a bunch of other gnarly safety problems.</p><p> 但是，我几乎立即违背诺言的一个地方就是安全性和完整性。我对这些细节非常感兴趣，在过去的几年中，我负责Facebook上的虚假新闻以及其他一系列过时的安全问题。</p><p> I found for the most part that [Instagram was] just running our own stuff, and our team was tiny. And so I made the team pivot and essentially [integrate] the technology and work with the engineers who worked on safety across the rest of the company. I actually lost a bunch of people because of that. Not because they disagreed that it was a better way to keep people safe on Instagram over the long run, but it just wasn’t why they signed up to be on the team. So it was pretty painful for six months on that front. And I lost some credibility with some of the people.</p><p> 我发现大部分时候，[Instagram]只是在运行我们自己的东西，而我们的团队很小。因此，我以团队为中心，实质上是[集成]技术，并与公司其他部门从事安全工作的工程师一起工作。因此，我实际上失去了一堆人。不是因为他们不同意从长远来看，这是使人们在Instagram上安全的更好的方法，但这不是为什么他们签约加入团队。因此，在这方面，六个月来非常痛苦。我在某些人中失去了信誉。 </p><p> But now safety and integrity is one of our strongest teams. So I’m proud of that. I think it’s good. But otherwise, yeah, we are lean and mean, just a few thousand people. Which is a ton of people, but not a lot considering that over a billion people use Instagram.</p><p>但是现在，安全与诚信是我们最强大的团队之一。所以我为此感到自豪。我觉得很好但是否则，是的，我们精瘦而卑鄙，只有几千人。这是一大批人，但考虑到超过十亿的人使用Instagram，这并不是很多。</p><p> The last public number you’ve given for Instagram’s user base two years ago was 1 billion users. You were very proud of the milestone. You just said, “over a billion.” What is the latest number?</p><p> 两年前，您为Instagram用户群提供的最后一个公开号码是10亿用户。您为这个里程碑感到非常自豪。您刚刚说，“超过10亿”。最新号码是多少？</p><p> I can’t share the latest numbers, as much as I’d love to beat our chest about our growth. I will say I’ve been really excited about our momentum this past year, particularly in terms of how fast we’ve grown. Most of our growth is not in the US. Our bubble is probably very US-biased, but for all these platforms like ours, most of the growth is outside of the country in which we’re headquartered.</p><p> 我无法分享最新的数据，就像我想为我们的成长打败胸脯一样。我要说的是，我对去年的发展势头感到非常兴奋，特别是在我们成长的速度方面。我们的大部分增长都不在美国。我们的泡沫可能是非常偏重美国的，但是对于像我们这样的所有平台，大多数增长都在我们总部所在的国家/地区之外。</p><p>  India is probably the fastest right now. India is coming online fast. You’re seeing hundreds of millions of people coming online over the next couple of years. The access to data is going up. The cost of data is going down.</p><p>  印度现在可能是最快的。印度正在迅速上线。在接下来的几年中，您会看到成千上万的人上网。对数据的访问正在增加。数据成本正在下降。</p><p> Reliance Jio is a carrier out there, for those who are not familiar. They basically offered free data for half a year, or maybe even more, which created a price war between all the carriers. That was a fun story because it was a brother whose other brother ran another carrier, and it basically became a family feud. There’s all sorts of fun drama.</p><p> 对于不熟悉的人，Reliance Jio是那里的载体。他们基本上提供了半年或更长时间的免费数据，这在所有运营商之间引发了价格战。那是一个有趣的故事，因为它是一个兄弟，另一个兄弟经营另一个承运人，并且基本上成了家庭争执。有各种各样有趣的戏剧。</p><p> So we’ve seen an immense amount of momentum there, especially as we started to focus more on our Android experience a couple years ago.</p><p> 因此，我们在那里看到了巨大的发展动力，尤其是几年前，我们开始更加专注于Android体验。</p><p> Fastest growth in India. You’re over a billion. Are you under 2 billion?</p><p> 印度增长最快。您超过十亿。您不到20亿吗？ </p><p>  I like to start with a bunch of frameworks, because I like to see how those frameworks are expressed in complicated decisions. Instagram is growing really fast. It’s part of this larger entity, Facebook, that has controversy associated with it all the time.</p><p>我喜欢从一堆框架开始，因为我喜欢看那些框架在复杂的决策中是如何表达的。 Instagram的增长非常快。它是这个更大的实体Facebook的一部分，该实体始终存在争议。</p><p> Specific to Instagram, you have rolled out a lot of new features. You have a big competitor in TikTok. There is the Facebook antitrust lawsuit, and there is a content moderation debate in the United States that feels like it’s at a tipping point.</p><p> 特定于Instagram，您已经推出了许多新功能。您在TikTok中拥有强大的竞争对手。有Facebook反托拉斯诉讼，在美国有一场内容审查辩论，似乎正处于转折点。</p><p> I think we should start there because I think it feeds into almost everything else that we will talk about. Just give people a sense, right now: what is the status of Trump’s Instagram presence, Trump’s Facebook relationship, and what happens next?</p><p> 我认为我们应该从这里开始，因为我认为它几乎涵盖了我们将要谈论的所有其他内容。现在就给人一种感觉：特朗普在Instagram的存在状态，特朗普与Facebook的关系是什么，接下来会发生什么？</p><p> We have  no plans to reinstate his account on any of the platforms, but if I’m honest, we’re less focused on a specific account and more focused on making sure that we do everything we can to avoid our platforms being used to coordinate violence at the inauguration coming up in a couple of days. I mean, there was a violent mob attack on the Capitol last week. So we’re very focused on doing everything we can, changing our policies, updating our enforcement, building products, and just trying to reduce the likelihood that anything is going on [on] our platform. That’s the primary focus. Once we get through the next week or two, then I think we can pop back up and talk about the president’s account, but we don’t have any plans right now to reinstate him.</p><p> 我们没有计划在任何平台上恢复他的帐户，但是，老实说，我们不太专注于特定帐户，而更专注于确保我们尽一切努力避免平台被用来协调几天后就职典礼上发生暴力事件。我的意思是，上周国会大厦发生了暴民袭击。因此，我们非常专注于竭尽所能，更改政策，更新执法，开发产品，并试图减少平台上发生任何事情的可能性。这是主要重点。一旦我们过了下一两周，我想我们可以跳起来谈论总统的帐户，但是我们现在没有任何计划可以恢复他的职务。</p><p>  Less than I used to because I pushed so hard to centralize most of that work. Now we draft as much as we can off of Facebook company policy decisions. Sometimes I have to dive into the details because there are things that are different about Instagram. For instance, we have parts of the app like Explore where you just have a grid of photos. Facebook doesn’t really have that.</p><p>  比以前少了，因为我努力地集中了大部分工作。现在，我们可以根据Facebook公司的政策决定尽力而为。有时候，我不得不深入研究细节，因为Instagram有一些不同之处。例如，我们有应用程序的一部分（例如“探索”），您仅拥有一张照片网格。 Facebook确实没有。</p><p> A lot of the content policies assume that you can see all the context around a piece of content, including the caption, but in Explore we’re showing photos without the caption in that context. So your policies around self-injury have to be different, for instance. You might talk about self-injury and show a scar and say, “I’m 40 days clean.” That’s a way of getting support and celebrating your journey and your safety, but if you show a scar without that context, it might not be okay.</p><p> 许多内容政策都假设您可以看到某内容周围的所有上下文，包括标题，但是在“探索”中，我们显示的是在该上下文中没有标题的照片。因此，例如，您对自我伤害的政策必须有所不同。您可能会谈论自残并留下疤痕，然后说：“我40天干净”。这是获得支持并庆祝您的旅程和安全的一种方式，但是如果您在没有这种情况的情况下出现伤痕，那可能就不好了。</p><p> So I get involved from time to time, often trying to make sure that our policies — that have often been written for Facebook first because of its age and size — are adapted, appropriate, and responsible in the Instagram context, which has some important differences.</p><p> 因此，我会时不时地参与进来，经常尝试确保我们的政策（由于年龄和规模而通常是为Facebook首先编写的）在Instagram上下文中适应，适当和负责任，这有一些重要的区别。 </p><p>  Well, there are no rooms anymore, so it’s easy to say no to that [laughs]. Ultimately, this was a Facebook company call, not an Instagram call, and I think that’s the right thing.</p><p>好吧，现在没有房间了，所以很容易对此说不。[笑]。最终，这是一个Facebook公司电话，而不是一个Instagram电话，我认为这是正确的。</p><p> You just got an email like, “It’s done,” and you’re like, “Okay, moving on.”</p><p> 您刚刚收到一封电子邮件，例如“完成了”，然后收到了“好吧，继续前进”。</p><p> No, no. [Laughs] It wasn’t quite that simple. I would be okay with that. [But] I agree with the decision, is the more important thing. I’m really worried about it, I’m not happy about it, but I definitely agree with it.</p><p> 不，不。 [笑]并不是那么简单。我可以的。 [但是]我同意这个决定，是更重要的事情。我真的很担心，对此我不满意，但我绝对同意。</p><p> Sheryl Sandberg gave a quote at a   Reuters  conference, where she said the attack was not planned on the Facebook platform. And then I heard from a lot of people at Facebook and Facebook companies saying, “What? We’re spending all of our time trying to tamp this down. It is happening here. It did happen here. We’re working on it.” You just said you’re working on it. Have you tamped it down to zero? Or are you seeing it pop up, and you’re trying to push it down?</p><p> 谢丽尔·桑德伯格（Sheryl Sandberg）在路透社会议上引述了她的话，她说这次攻击没有计划在Facebook平台上进行。然后我从Facebook和Facebook公司的很多人那里听到，“什么？我们花了所有的时间试图解决这个问题。它在这里发生。它确实发生在这里。我们正在努力。”您只是说您正在努力。你把它压低到零了吗？还是您看到它弹出了，并试图将其推下？</p><p> It’s impossible to tamp anything down to zero. There’s over a billion people on Instagram, and there’s billions of people on our other apps between WhatsApp, Facebook, and Messenger. If success is perfection, where nothing bad happens on the platform, then we’re always going to end up failing because at some level, social media broadly, and messaging apps and technology, are a reflection of humanity. We communicated offline, and all of the sudden now we’re also communicating online. Because we’re communicating online, we can see some of the ugly and gnarly things we missed before. Some of the great and wonderful things, too.</p><p> 不可能将任何内容压低到零。 Instagram上有超过10亿的人，而我们在WhatsApp，Facebook和Messenger之间的其他应用上的人也有数十亿。如果成功是完美的，平台上不会发生任何不良情况，那么我们总是会以失败告终，因为在某种程度上，广泛的社交媒体以及消息传递应用程序和技术都反映了人性。我们离线交流，现在突然之间我们也在线交流。因为我们在线交流，所以我们可以看到以前错过的一些丑陋和肮脏的事物。还有一些很棒的事情。</p><p> But there’s never going to be perfection there. Now, if you read Sheryl’s full quote, she said that most of the coordination was happening on platforms other than ours, because of the work that we’ve done. She got hit pretty bad for that statement on Twitter, but you should look at the whole conversation. The conversation pretty quickly moved from “Was the mob coordinated on the platform?” to “Were people radicalized on the platform and then they participated in this thing?”</p><p> 但是那里永远不会完美。现在，如果您阅读Sheryl的完整报价，她说由于我们已经完成的工作，大多数协调都发生在我们平台以外的平台上。她因在Twitter上发表的声明而受到打击，但是您应该看整个对话。对话很快就从“暴徒在平台上进行协调了吗？”转变了。到“人们是否在平台上激进化，然后又参与了此事？”</p><p> That is an important, subtle shift. From where I sit, it’s important that we take a look at whether social media radicalizes people. And if so, what can we do about it? I think that social media isn’t good or bad, like any technology, it just is. But social media is specifically a great amplifier. It can amplify good and bad. It’s our responsibility to make sure that we amplify more good and less bad.</p><p> 这是一个重要的，微妙的转变。从我所坐的位置来看，重要的是我们要看看社交媒体是否使人们激进化。如果是这样，我们该怎么办？我认为社交媒体不是好事，就像任何技术一样。但是社交媒体尤其是一个很好的放大器。它可以放大好坏。我们有责任确保我们扩大好坏。 </p><p>  But it’s not just about social media. If we’re going to talk about the events of the last week, why do conspiracy theories and these radical right fringe narratives appeal to so many people? It can’t be completely blamed on social media. Yes, I think we have to look at ourselves and make sure that we’re being thoughtful, and that we’re not making anything worse, but why do people trust the government in this country so little that those narratives are resonating in the first place? That’s a bigger societal problem than just any one platform or industry.</p><p>但这不只是社交媒体。如果我们要谈论上周的事件，为什么阴谋论和这些激进的正确边缘叙述吸引了这么多人？不能完全归咎于社交媒体。是的，我认为我们必须审视自己，并确保我们正在考虑周全，并且没有使任何事情变得更糟，但是为什么人们对这个国家的政府的信任度如此之低，以至于这些叙述在第一时间引起了共鸣。地点？这是比任何一个平台或行业都更大的社会问题。</p><p> So I think it’s important to look at the whole picture. Now, if you work in tech, you’re under a ton of scrutiny, and you have been for years. I think that’s fundamentally a good thing. It’s super uncomfortable and unpleasant at times, but at the end of the day, you learn, you weed out the noise, you focus on the signal, and you get better. I think we should also scrutinize the whole system because there’s a lot that’s broken right now. And it’s not just technology.</p><p> 因此，我认为重要的是要看整个图片。现在，如果您从事技术工作，则需要进行大量审查，并且已经工作了多年。我认为这从根本上来说是一件好事。有时会非常不舒服和令人不快，但最终，您会学到，消除杂讯，专注于信号，然后变得更好。我认为我们也应该仔细检查整个系统，因为现在有很多地方已经崩溃了。不仅是技术。</p><p> I think that conspiracy theories have always been part of the fabric of American culture, but rarely have they felt so dominant, and very rarely have they expressed themselves in such a mass acceptance of violence. But I can’t look back and say, “Well, social media didn’t play a small role in that.” It feels like the amplification power of social media, not just on your platform, but on every platform — YouTube, Twitter, what have you — has fed into that in a pretty real way.</p><p> 我认为，阴谋论一直是美国文化的一部分，但很少有人觉得自己如此占主导地位，也很少有人如此接受暴力。但是我不能回头说：“嗯，社交媒体在其中没有扮演很小的角色。”感觉就像社交媒体的放大功能，不仅在您的平台上，而且在每个平台（YouTube，Twitter，您拥有的一切）上都已经以相当真实的方式发挥了作用。</p><p> So one of the questions, broadly, is how much responsibility should a platform like yours take for what it amplifies? There’s a pretty unsophisticated debate about the algorithm, but Facebook runs on algorithmic amplification. You used to </p><p> 因此，从广义上来说，问题之一是，像您这样的平台应该对它的放大功能承担多少责任？关于该算法的争论很简单，但是Facebook依靠算法放大。你以前</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facebook/">#facebook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/行为/">#行为</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/instagram/">#instagram</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
