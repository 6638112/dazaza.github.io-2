app  Fireside has yet to publicly launch, but already it\u2019s asking the limited creators on its platform for money. In an email sent to users late last night and viewed by  The Verge, co-founder and CEO Falon Fatemi says she and the team are accepting investments through the month of August from anyone who\u2019s interested.\n \u201cIf you believe in our vision, this is your chance to be part of it,\u201d she writes. \u201cPut your money where your mouth is :) (We did.)\u201d\n The email says more details are to come and doesn\u2019t disclose the deal terms, how the investments will work, what the app\u2019s valuation is, or how much the team is hoping to raise. But the email does also make a couple other announcements about the future of the app and its vision.\n  Next week, at the conference Podcast Movement, Fatemi says she and Cuban will take the stage to announce a partnership with podcast hosting service Libsyn. As  The Verge reported  in March, Fireside hosts live audio chats similarly to Clubhouse and allows users to record those conversations. The team had told creators it planned to allow them to distribute their files as RSS-based podcasts, and the Libsyn partnership appears to be the solution for that goal. Fatemi says users will be able to optionally distribute their shows as a podcast with \u201cone tap.\u201d\n Additionally, she says the team has arranged a deal with audio hardware company Rode to offer users discounts on various equipment. Again, no details were provided.\n A Fireside spokesperson declined to comment. We\u2019ve also reached out to Libsyn and Rode and will update if we hear back.\n Meanwhile, the Fireside app launched on iOS last week in a closed beta. Users who download the app can sign up with their phone number and email to try to get off the waitlist. Fatemi writes in her email that the app is very much not like  Clubhouse, Facebook  Live Audio Rooms, or  Twitter Spaces.\n \u201cAs many of you know the early media speculation miscategorized us as social audio \u2014 as many of you have stated we are creating an entirely new category,\u201d she writes. What exactly that new category is, I\u2019m unclear. You can see a teaser trailer for the app below, which focuses on digital creators owning their work.\n  Still, despite Fireside\u2019s ownership goals, podcasting newsletter  Podnews  flagged last week that some of the app\u2019s terms stood out as not creator friendly. Notably, Fireside and associated parties may use the \u201crecordings, including your name and likeness, for any commercial and non-commercial purposes (including the creation of NFTs), including to use, reproduce, distribute, and license to others in accordance with Fireside\u2019s Terms of Service, in any manner of media whatsoever now or hereafter known, without further compensation or permissions.\u201d\n The terms also seem to give Fireside ultimate ownership of recordings that happen in the app, and an arbitration clause is included, as well. Some of these details might be standard, but again, they stand out because of Fatemi\u2019s stated interest in freeing creators from binding ownership agreements.\n It\u2019s unclear when Fireside will publicly launch, arguably the detail everyone wants to hear.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:34:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "cuban,creators,fireside",

from users claiming that the screens in their new M1 MacBooks have been cracking during \u201cnormal usage\u201d \u2014 that includes M1 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.\n  I bought a MacBook Air M1 6 months ago and the screen cracked for no apparent reason. I left my computer on the top of my desk during the night and the next day I opened it the screen had 2 small cracks on the right which damaged the functioning of the screen. I contacted an authorized apple center which told me apple warranty would not cover it as it is a contact point crack; as if I have left something the size of a rice berry between the screen and the keyboard\u2026 It is absurd as I have nothing like it on my desk and the computer was properly closed as usual and didn\u2019t move the whole night. More than the price of repairing it , it is frustrating that apple doesn\u2019t believe its costumers.\n  \u2013 User laura8lx\n Replies to that same thread seem to indicate that this has been happening to quite a few users.\n As of this morning I, too, have the same issue. Turned my M1 MacBook Pro on as usual and the screen was obviously cracked. I have done nothing to cause this.\n \u2013 User Truth42\n I have just experienced the same thing. On July 28th I closed my laptop to take the dog outside. I came back in and opened up the laptop and there was a crack.\n \u2013 User CanadaM1\n Another user on  Reddit claims that they had not dropped or applied pressure to their screen and still opened their MacBook to find the display had been busted.\n  It\u2019s worth noting that for some of these users, Apple went ahead and replaced the entire MacBook, at no cost. For some, however, they had to pay out of pocket for Apple to collect the machine for repair.\n I had to pay \u00a3570 before Apple would collect the machine for repair. They tell me their technicians will decide if I get a refund. Not happy.\n \u2013 User Truth42\n As much as I love a good \u201c My MacBook Pro for NO REASON\u201d headline, I have a hard time believing that these cracks are indeed happening for \u201cno reason\u201d.\n Often dirt can get caught and press into the display when the laptop is closed, and other times, it can happen purely based on how a user may have opened or closed the unit.\n I\u2019d say it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that some of these \u201creports\u201d are from users who shut their MacBook screen onto a keyboard with a bunch of Doritos crumbs stuck in it.  And if you, too, had a Doritos-related MacBook Pro screen incident, it\u2019s worth driving that sucker right to the Apple Store and saying \u2014 with a straight face \u2014 that it happened for \u201cno apparent reason\u201d.

silver and bronze medals will be handed out in more than 300 events. Prior research, using human coding, has revealed that bronze medalists appeared happier than silver medalists. However, scholars have debated the reasons why for years.  According to new research from the Carlson School of Management  published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, facial expression software \u2014 which nearly eliminates possible bias \u2014 offers important insight. The research was led by  William Hedgcock, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota\u2019s  Carlson School of Management.  Hedgcock and his team compiled the largest dataset ever used to study this phenomenon and are the first to use facial expression software. Altogether, they studied medal stand photographs of 413 athletes from 142 sporting events, representing 67 countries, across five Olympic Summer Games between 2000 and 2016. Using commercial facial expression software, they compared the facial appearance of all three medalists both to what position they finished and how they were predicted to finish.  The results replicated and expanded on what was previously found: bronze medalists were more likely to exhibit a smile than silver medalists, while gold medalists were happier than other medalists. Two explanations supported by the study, both based on what scientists refer to as counterfactual thinking, are:\n Silver medalists formed an upward comparison to the gold medalists with thoughts of \u201cI almost won gold,\u201d while bronze medalists formed a downward comparison to a fourth-place finisher with thoughts of \u201cat least I won a medal.\u201d\n  Medalists form their thoughts based on what their expectations were entering the event, with silver medalists being more disappointed because their prior expectations for performance were higher than bronze medalists.\n \u201cNow we have a better idea why athletes who did objectively better, as in won silver versus bronze, might appear less happy,\u201d explained Hedgcock. \u201cThe notion of making upward and downward comparisons not only applies to Olympic medalists, but also to many aspects of life such as performance at work, school or when making purchases, for example.  \u201cOur experience with this study suggests the software, which has primarily been used in controlled settings, is also useful for large-scale facial expression studies in less-controlled, real-world applications,&#34; commented Hedgcock in regards to this study opening the door for more research of this kind.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:33:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Does my name belong to me? Does my face? What about my life? My story? Why is my name used to refer to events I had no hand in? I return to these questions because others continue to profit off my name, face, and story without my consent. Most recently, the film  Stillwater.\n This new film by director Tom McCarthy, starrin  g Matt Damon, is \u201cloosely based\u201d or \u201cdirectly inspired by\u201d the \u201cAmanda Knox saga,\u201d as  Vanity Fair put it in a for-profit article promoting a for-profit film, neither of which I am affiliated with. I want to pause right here on that phrase: \u201cthe Amanda Knox saga.\u201d What does that refer to? Does it refer to anything I did? No. It refers to the events that resulted from the murder of Meredith Kercher by a burglar named Rudy Guede. It refers to the shoddy police work, prosecutorial tunnel vision, and refusal to admit their mistakes that led the Italian authorities to wrongfully convict me, twice.\n In those four years of wrongful imprisonment and 8 years of trial, I had near-zero agency. Everyone else in that \u201csaga\u201d had more influence over the course of events than I did. The erroneous focus on me by the Italian authorities led to an erroneous focus on me by the press, which shaped how I was presented to the world. In prison, I had no control over my public image, no voice in my story.\n This focus on me led many to complain that Meredith had been forgotten. But of course, who did they blame for that? Not the Italian authorities. Not the press. Me! Somehow it was my fault that the police and media focused on me at Meredith\u2019s expense. The result of this is that 15 years later, my name is the name associated with this tragic series of events, of which I had zero impact on. Meredith\u2019s name is often left out, as is  Rudy Guede\u2019s. When he was released from prison recently, this was the  NY Post headline.\n  In the wake of #metoo, more people are coming to understand how power dynamics shape a story. Who had the power in the relationship between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky? The president or the intern? It matters what you call a thing. Calling that event the \u201cLewinsky Scandal\u201d fails to acknowledge the vast power differential, and I\u2019m glad that more people are now referring to it as \u201cthe Clinton Affair\u201d which names it after the person with the most agency in that series of events.\n I would love nothing more than for people to refer to the events in Perugia as \u201cThe murder of Meredith Kercher by Rudy Guede,\u201d which would place me as the peripheral figure I should have been, the innocent roommate. But I know that my wrongful conviction, and subsequent trials, became the story that people obsessed over. I know they\u2019re going to call it the \u201cAmanda Knox saga\u201d into the future. That being the case, I have a few small requests:\n Don\u2019t blame me for the fact that others put the focus on me instead of Meredith. And when you refer to these events, understand that how you talk about it affects the people involved: Meredith\u2019s family, my family, Raffaele Sollecito, and me.\n Don\u2019t do what Pete Hammond did when reviewing  Stillwater for  Deadline, referring to me as a convicted murderer while conveniently leaving out my acquittal. I asked him to correct it. No response.\n  And if you must refer to the \u201cAmanda Knox saga,\u201d maybe don\u2019t call it, as the The New York Times did in profiling Matt Damon, \u201cthe sordid Amanda Knox saga.\u201d Sordid: morally vile. Not a great adjective to have placed next to your name. Repeat something often enough, and people believe it.\n Now,  Stillwater is by no means the first thing to rip off my story without my consent at the expense of my reputation. There was of course the terrible Lifetime movie that I sued them over, resulting in them cutting a dream sequence where I was depicted as murdering Meredith.\n A few years ago, there was the Fox series   Proven Innocent, which was developed and marketed as \u201cWhat if Amanda Knox became a lawyer?\u201d The first I heard from the show\u2019s makers was when they had the audacity to ask me to help them promote it on the eve of its premiere.\n  Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s last book, Talking to Strangers, features a whole chapter analyzing my case. He reached out on the eve of publication to ask if he could use excerpts of my audiobook in his audiobook. He didn\u2019t think to ask for an interview before forming his conclusions about me. To his credit, Gladwell responded to my critiques over email, and was gracious enough to join me on my podcast,   Labyrinths. I extend the same invitation to Tom McCarthy and Matt Damon, who I hope hear what I\u2019m about to say about  Stillwater.\n Stillwater was \u201cdirectly inspired by the Amanda Knox saga.\u201d Director Tom McCarthy tells Vanity Fair, \u201che couldn\u2019t help but imagine how it would feel to be in Knox\u2019s shoes.\u201d \u2026but that didn\u2019t inspire him to ask me how it felt to be in my shoes. He became interested in the family dynamics of the \u201cAmanda Knox saga.\u201d \u201cWho are the people that are visiting [her], and what are those relationships? Like, what\u2019s the story  around the story?\u201d My family and I have a lot to say about that, and would have told McCarthy\u2026if he\u2019d ever reached out.\n \u201cWe decided, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s leave the Amanda Knox case behind,\u2019\u201d McCarthy tells Vanity Fair. \u201cBut let me take this piece of the story \u2014 an American woman studying abroad involved in some kind of sensational crime and she ends up in jail \u2014 and fictionalize everything around it.\u201d Let me stop you right there. That story,  my story, is  not about an American woman studying abroad \u201cinvolved in some kind of sensational crime.\u201d It\u2019s about an American woman  NOT involved in a sensational crime, and yet wrongfully convicted.\n And if you\u2019re going to \u201cleave the Amanda Knox case behind,\u201d and \u201cfictionalize everything around it,\u201d maybe don\u2019t use my name to promote it. You\u2019re not leaving the Amanda Knox case behind very well if every single review mentions me. You\u2019re not leaving the Amanda Knox case behind when my face appears on profiles and articles about the film.\n But, all this I mostly forgive. I get it. There\u2019s money to be made, and you have no obligation to approach me. What I\u2019m more bothered by is how this film, \u201cdirectly inspired by the Amanda Knox saga, \u201cfictionalizes\u201d me and this story.\n I was accused of being involved in a death orgy, a sex-game gone wrong, when I was nothing but platonic friends with Meredith. But the fictionalized me in  Stillwater does have a sexual relationship with her murdered roommate.\n In the film, the character based on me gives a tip to her father to help find the man who really killed her friend. Matt Damon tracks him down. This fictionalizing erases the corruption and ineptitude of the authorities.\n What\u2019s crazier is that, in reality, the authorities already had the killer in custody. He was convicted before my trial even began. They didn\u2019t need to find him. And even so, they pressed on in persecuting me, because they didn\u2019t want to admit they had been wrong.\n McCarthy told Vanity Fair that \u201c Stillwater\u2019s ending was inspired not by the outcome of Knox\u2019s case, but by the demands of the script he and his collaborators had created.\u201d Cool, so I wonder, is the character based on me actually innocent?\n Turns out, she asked the killer to help her get rid of her roommate. She didn\u2019t mean for him to kill her, but her request indirectly led to the murder. How do you think that impacts my reputation?\n I continue to be accused of \u201cknowing something I\u2019m not revealing,\u201d of \u201chaving been involved somehow, even if I didn\u2019t plunge the knife.\u201d So Tom McCarthy\u2019s fictionalized version of me is just the tabloid conspiracy guilter version of me.\n By fictionalizing away my innocence, my total lack of involvement, by erasing the role of the authorities in my wrongful conviction, McCarthy reinforces an image of me as a guilty and untrustworthy person. And with Matt Damon\u2019s star power, both are sure to profit handsomely off of this fictionalization of \u201cthe Amanda Knox saga\u201d that is sure to leave plenty of viewers wondering, \u201cMaybe the real-life Amanda was involved somehow.\u201d\n Which brings me to my screenplay idea! It\u2019s directly inspired by the life of Matt Damon. He\u2019s an actor, celebrity, etc. Except I\u2019m going to fictionalize everything around it, and the Damon-like character in my film is involved in a murder. He didn\u2019t plunge the knife per se, but he\u2019s definitely at fault somehow. His name is Damien Matthews, and he starred in the Jackson Burne spy films. He works with Tim McClatchy, who\u2019s a Harvey Weinstein type. It\u2019s loosely based on reality. Shouldn\u2019t bother Matt or Tom, right?\n I joke, but of course, I understand that Tom McCarthy and Matt Damon have no moral obligation to consult me when profiting by telling a story that distorts my reputation in negative ways. And I reiterate my offer to interview them on  Labyrinths. I bet we could have a fascinating conversation about identity, and public perception, and who should get to exploit a name, face, and story that has entered the public imagination.\n I never asked to become a public person. The Italian authorities and global media made that choice for me. And when I was acquitted and freed, the media and the public wouldn\u2019t allow me to become a private citizen again. I went back to school and fellow students photographed me surreptitiously, people who lived in my apartment building invented stories for the tabloids, I worked a minimum wage job at a used bookstore, only to be confronted by stalkers at the counter. I was hounded by paparazzi, my story and trauma was (and is) endlessly recycled for entertainment, and in the process, I\u2019ve been accused of shifting attention away from the memory of Meredith Kercher, of being a media whore.\n I have not been allowed to return to the relative anonymity I had before Perugia. My only option is to sit idly by while others continue to distort my character, or fight to restore my good reputation that was wrongfully destroyed.\n It\u2019s an uphill battle. I probably won\u2019t succeed. But I\u2019ve been here before. I know what it\u2019s like facing impossible odds.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:32:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u62e5\u6709,owns", "title":

"note_en": "James Meador, an independent researcher at the California Institute of Technology, has found evidence that suggests the Apollo 11 ascent stage may still be orbiting the moon. He has written a paper outlining his research and findings and has posted it on the arXiv preprint server.    In 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made history when they landed a craft successfully on the  . After more than 21 hours on the surface, the astronauts blasted off the surface in a part of the Eagle lander called the ascent stage. They soon thereafter rendezvoused with Michael Collins in the command module which carried them back to Earth. Before departing for Earth, the ascent stage was jettisoned into space\u2014NASA engineers assumed that it would crash back to the moon&#39;s surface sometime later. Meador reports that the ascent stage may not have crashed into the moon after all and might, in fact, still be orbiting the moon.\n  Meador began his investigation by considering whether it might be possible to find the ascent stage, which he assumed would be on the   of the moon. He noted that NASA had sent spacecraft into   around the moon in 2012 as part of the GRAIL project to map the moon&#39;s gravitational field. That suggested he should be able to track the ascent stage&#39;s descent to the moon using a tool created by NASA called the General Mission Analysis Tool, which can be used to map spacecraft trajectories around planets or moons when their gravitational field is known.\n  After adding   from GRAIL, Meador ran the simulation multiple times using different parameters to simulate conditions that likely existed from the time when the ascent was jettisoned on up to the present. He also included data to take into account gravity from the sun and the other planets (except Mercury) and data describing forces due to solar radiation. He found that all of his simulations showed the ascent stage maintaining a steady orbit.\n  Meador acknowledges that other factors could have led to the demise of the craft\u2014its remaining fuel could have exploded as the craft degraded, for example, changing its orbit. But he also notes that if the agency chooses to look for it, NASA possesses the technology needed to find the craft if it is still in orbit.

Why? Because you\u2019ve got an awesome sysadmin (or maybe a whole IT department) keeping your business up and running. So say IT loud; say IT proud \u2026\n  Wait\u2026 what exactly is SysAdmin Day? Oh, it\u2019s only the single greatest 24 hours on the planet\u2026 and pretty much the most important holiday of the year. It\u2019s also the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to the heroic men and women who, come rain or shine, prevent disasters, keep IT secure and put out tech fires left and right.\n At this point, you may be thinking, \u201cGreat. I get it. My sysadmin is a rock star. But now what?\u201d Glad you asked! Proper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to):\n   Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. On this special international day, give your System Administrator something that shows that you truly appreciate their hard work and dedication. ( All day Friday, 24 hours, your own local time-zone).\n Let\u2019s face it, System Administrators get no respect 364 days a year. This is the day that all fellow System Administrators across the globe, will be showered with expensive sports cars and large piles of cash in appreciation of their diligent work. But seriously, we are asking for a nice token gift and some public acknowledgement. It\u2019s the least you could do.\n Consider all the daunting tasks and long hours (weekends too.) Let\u2019s be honest, sometimes we don\u2019t know our System Administrators as well as they know us. Remember this is one day to recognize your System Administrator for their workplace contributions and to promote professional excellence. Thank them for all the things they do for you and your business.\n  Please share your Sysadmin Day celebration photos.\u00a0 Post your photos on  Facebook,  Flickr,  Reddit,  Twitter, and your preferred social media.\u00a0 Always use the tag  #SysAdminDay.\n Our official Facebook page:  https://facebook.com/SysAdminDayHoliday \u2014 Post your SysAdmin Day party invites and events.\u00a0

giant Neoen\u00a0worked with\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and AusNet Services to develop the grid-scale project.\n The state of Victoria is aiming for a renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.\n A fire occurred within a Tesla Megapack at one of the largest batteries in the world in Australia&#39;s Victoria state around 10:15 a.m. local time on Friday, CNBC has confirmed.\n The cause of the fire at the Victorian Big Battery site in Geelong, Victoria is not yet known.\n  Paris-based renewable energy giant  Neoen\u00a0worked with\u00a0 Tesla\u00a0and AusNet Services to develop the grid-scale project with the aim of helping the state of Victoria meet a renewable energy target of 50% by 2030.\n According to recent updates shared by Neoen Australia on Twitter, the battery was only recently registered with the Australian Energy Market Operator. The fire happened during testing.\n  According to a spokesperson for AEMO, the electricity market operator, the site has been safely isolated from the electricity grid and has not impacted electricity supply in the area.\n Gigantic batteries like those offered by Tesla, ABB and newcomers like Northvolt can help grid operators move extra capacity between states and ensure that power from intermittent, renewable energy sources including solar and wind can be stored and used when needed.\n Projects like Neoen&#39;s Victorian Big Battery, and systems like Tesla Megapacks within it, can also ensure power is available even when there are unplanned outages in a transmission network.\n  In a recent earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk talked up his company&#39;s growing energy storage business claiming there is demand for more than 1 million of Tesla&#39;s home Powerwall batteries, and &#34;a vast amount&#34; of Megapacks for utilities. Tesla energy generation and storage revenue during the second quarter of 2021 reached $801 million, with cost of revenue for this division hitting $781 million for the quarter.\n According to a statement sent to CNBC on behalf of Louis de Sambucy, managing director of Neoen Australia, the fire occurred &#34;within one of the Tesla Megapacks at the Victorian Big Battery&#34; during initial testing of the system on Friday. No one was injured and the site was evacuated.\n He added, &#34;Neoen and Tesla are working closely with emergency services on site to manage the situation.\u00a0The site has been disconnected from the grid and there will be no impact to the electricity supply.&#34;\n Neoen also said it would provide updates when new information was available. Tesla and AusNet did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n Musk wrote on Twitter following news of the fire at the big battery site, &#34;Prometheus unbound,&#34; a reference to the god of fire.\n  Australia&#39;s  Financial Review reported that the fire triggered a toxic smoke warning, and authorities instructed residents in nearby suburbs to close their doors and windows, and turn off heating and cooling systems.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:31:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "With hopes pinned on mass vaccination programs seeing an eventual end to the  COVID-19  pandemic,  citizens around the world are lining up for a jab.\n So far, efforts to curb the outbreak by spreading immunity this way\u00a0 seem to be working\u00a0- but according to new research, right now might also be the worst time to let down our guard.\n   A team of scientists led by researchers from the Institute of Science and Technology Austria calculated the risk of a vaccine-resistant strain emerging under different scenarios according to a  modified model of  SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n Central to each scenario was the rate of vaccine uptake within a population of 10 million over three years, and the extent to which non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing and social distancing make a difference.\n Unsurprisingly, a rapid roll-out where everybody receives their full quota of approved immunizations in the shortest time would leave the deadly  coronavirus few opportunities to randomly develop antibody-resistant genes.\n At the other end, having a mutating  virus spread unfettered through a susceptible population gives the pathogen plenty of chances to roll the dice on fancy new talents that may help it jump between more hosts with greater efficiency.\n We might imagine that the most perfidious kind of pathogen \u2013 one that would innovate to avoid our immune system in ever more insidious ways \u2013 would arise in a population where nobody is vaccinated.\n &#34;By contrast, a counterintuitive result of our analysis is that the highest risk of resistant strain establishment occurs when a large fraction of the population has already been vaccinated but the transmission is not controlled,&#34; the researchers  conclude.\n   More specifically, in situations where an emergent strain is permitted to spread, its emergence occurs when around 60 percent of those model 10 million citizens have been fully immunized.\n Having nearly two-thirds of a population with their full quota of vaccinations might seem like a good time to throw off the mask and hug loved ones in celebration of  newfound freedom. Unfortunately, based on predictions under this model, there couldn&#39;t be a worse time to relax.\n &#34;One simple specific recommendation is to keep transmission low even when a large fraction of the population has been vaccinated by implementing acute non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. strict adherence to social distancing) for a reasonable period of time, to allow emergent lineages of resistant strains to go extinct,&#34; the researchers  advise.\n Every time a virus particle replicates itself, there&#39;s a chance its library of genes will tumble into a new configuration. Any one of those configurations could potentially outwit an immune system that&#39;s already received a vaccine, leaving us all unprotected once more.\n We don&#39;t have to make this lottery win an easy one. Throwing as many obstacles as possible at the virus ensures it needs to chance upon every clever trick in the book before it gets to claim the big prize.\n   The goal of  herd immunity is a shifting one, reliant on more factors than simply how many people have enough  antibodies to ward off a significant infection.\n Of course, vaccines play a central role in us all returning to a more intimate, less confined life. Hitting high numbers of immunized bodies as quickly as possible is vital. But the strategy isn&#39;t one where we can take our foot off the accelerator as we approach the finish line.\n If anything, now is the time to double down, lest the hardships we&#39;ve endured become sacrifices made in vain.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:28:27", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "sars,\u4f20\u64ad", "title": "\u6297\u6027 SARS-CoV-2

"note_en": "By 1915, any list of the world\u2019s greatest living mathematicians included the name David Hilbert. And though Hilbert previously devoted his career to logic and pure mathematics, he, like many other critical thinkers at the time, eventually\u00a0became obsessed with a bit of  theoretical physics.\n With World War I raging on throughout Europe, Hilbert could be found sitting in his office at the great university at G\u00f6ttingen trying and trying again to understand one idea\u2014Einstein\u2019s new theory of gravity.\n G\u00f6ttingen served as the center of mathematics for the Western world by this point, and Hilbert stood as one of its most notorious thinkers. He was a prominent leader for the minority of mathematicians who preferred a symbolic, axiomatic development in contrast to a more concrete style that emphasized the construction of particular solutions. Many of his peers recoiled from these modern methods, one even\u00a0 calling\u00a0them \u201ctheology.\u201d But Hilbert eventually won over\u00a0most critics through the power and fruitfulness of his research.\n For Hilbert, his\u00a0rigorous approach to mathematics stood out quite a bit from the common practice of scientists, causing him some consternation. \u201cPhysics is much too hard for physicists,\u201d he  famously quipped. So wanting to know more, he invited Einstein to G\u00f6ttingen to lecture about gravity for a week.\n Before the year ended, both men would submit papers deriving the complete equations of general relativity. But naturally, the papers differed  entirely when it came to their methods. When it came to Einstein\u2019s theory, Hilbert and his G\u00f6ttingen colleagues simply couldn\u2019t wrap their minds around a peculiarity having to do with energy. All other physical theories\u2014including electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, and the classical theory of gravity\u2014obeyed\u00a0 local energy conservation. With Einstein&#39;s theory, one of the many paradoxical consequences of this failure of energy conservation was that an object could speed up as it lost energy by emitting gravity waves, whereas clearly it should slow down.\n Unable to make progress, Hilbert turned to the only person he believed might have the specialized knowledge and insight to help. This would-be-savior wasn\u2019t even allowed to be a student at G\u00f6ttingen once upon a time, but Hilbert had long become a fan of this mathematician\u2019s highly &#34;abstract&#34; approach (which Hilbert considered similar to his own style). He managed to recruit this soon-to-be partner to G\u00f6ttingen about the same time Einstein showed up.\n    And that\u2019s when a  woman\u2014one Emmy Noether\u2014created\u00a0what may be the most important single theoretical result\u00a0in modern physics.\n  Emmy (officially Amalie Emmy) Noether, born 1882, did not stand out in any particular way as a child, although she did, on occasion, attract some notice for her\u00a0 astonishing quickness\u00a0in providing accurate answers to puzzles or problems in logic or mathematics. Her father, Max, was a fairly prominent mathematician, and one of her brothers eventually attained a doctorate in math. In retrospect, perhaps the Noethers may be another historical example of a family with a math gene.\n Germany in the early years of the 20th century was not a convenient place for a woman\u00a0who wanted to pursue mathematics, or for that matter, any academic field outside of a few considered appropriate for the\u00a0sex. Luckily for Noether, she had a facility with languages and was allowed to\u00a0 become certified\u00a0as a language teacher. But Noether recognized her passion was in\u00a0mathematics, and she decided to chase her dream and find a way to\u00a0study the subject at the university level.\n While women were not permitted to be official students at most German universities then, they were able to audit courses with the permission of the professor. Noether started this way, sitting in on classes at the University of Erlangen. But she also spent a semester in 1903\u22121904 auditing courses at G\u00f6ttingen, where she first encountered Hilbert. Rules surrounding enrollment eventually relaxed, and Noether later matriculated at Erlangen to earn her doctorate in mathematics ( summa cum laude) in 1907.\n However, women were still not accepted as teachers in German universities at the time. Emmy took her fresh doctorate and\u00a0 became\u00a0an unofficial assistant to her ailing and increasingly frail father, a professor at Erlangen. She also vigorously attacked her own research, forging a personal and original path through abstract algebra. Just a year after her doctorate, Noether&#39;s papers and the doctoral research that she was unofficially supervising gained her election to several academic societies, which prompted invitations to speak around Europe. Among those wanting her around, Hilbert reached out to bring Noether to G\u00f6ttingen in order to tackle Einstein\u2019s theory.\n     No one denied it\u2014Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity was undoubtedly beautiful. It was unlike any theory of nature yet imagined by humankind, more surprising and radical even than the special theory of relativity that Einstein had laid out in his revolutionary paper ten years before.\n Newton described gravity simply as a force acting over a distance attracting any two masses, whether planets or apples, to each other. The force was proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. That\u2019s the entire story, and it worked well for over two hundred years.\n But there was a\u00a0 mystery\u00a0embedded in this description of gravity that physicists lived with for those two centuries. This coincidence was impossible to ignore, yet seemingly impossible to explain. The mass that determined the strength of the gravitational force was the same mass that appeared in Newton\u2019s second law of motion, F = ma; gravitational mass was the same as the \u201cinertial mass.\u201d There was no apparent reason this had to be true, it simply was.\n Einstein didn\u2019t think this was mere coincidence. He formulated a \u201c principle of equivalence\u201d that can be described in several ways. One way is to insist that the two types of mass are identical because of a fundamental symmetry in nature; that the laws of physics must take the same form whether one is in a gravitational field or in a region of space with no gravity (say, in a spaceship undergoing an equivalent acceleration). Carrying this principle to its logical conclusions eventually led to the equations of general relativity, the theory considered by many ( including\u00a0the great theoretical physicist Lev Landau) to be \u201cprobably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\u201d\n Although Hilbert recognized that general relativity was a tremendous accomplishment, the energy conservation conundrum struck him as unacceptable. To illustrate this idea, let\u2019s draw a circle around a region of space, as in the diagram here.\n The circle might contain electric and magnetic fields, water in motion, or something else. If we keep track of the energy flowing out of (and into) the perimeter of the circle (E f) during a certain interval of time, then that total transfer of energy is equal to the amount that the total energy inside the circle (E v) has changed. This is local energy conservation. In simple terms, energy is not created or destroyed, just moved around.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 22:28:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "The company, which is in the midst of moving its headquarters to New York, sells health insurance, retirement savings plans and tax withholding directly to freelancers, contractors or anyone uncovered.\n It is now armed with a fresh round of $12 million in Series A funding, led by Crosslink, with participation from earlier investors Khosla Ventures, NYCA Partners, Kindred Ventures and Urban Innovation Fund, to support more distribution partnerships and its relocation from Boston.\n  Co-founders Kristen Anderson and Andrew Ambrosino started Catch in 2019 and  raised $6.1 million previously, giving it a total of $18.1 million in funding.\n It took the Catch team of 15 nearly two years to get approvals to sell its platform in 38 states on the federal marketplace. Anderson boasts that only eight companies have been able to do this, and three of them \u2014 Catch included \u2014 are approved to sell benefits to consumers. The other side of the business is payroll, and the company has gathered thousands of sources based on biller.\n \u201cMore companies are not offering healthcare, while more people are joining the creator and gig economies, which means more people are not following an employer-led model,\u201d Anderson told TechCrunch.\n The age of an average Catch customer is 32 years old, and in addition to current offerings, were asking the company to help them set up income sources, like setting aside money for taxes, retirement, as well as medical leave without having to actively save.\n When the global pandemic hit, many of Catch\u2019s customers saw their income collapse, 40% overall across industries, as workers like hairstylists and cooks had income go down to zero in some cases.\n It was then that Anderson and Ambrosino began looking at partnership distribution and developed a network of platforms, business facilitation tools, gig marketplaces and payroll companies that were interested in offering Catch. The company intends to use some of the funding to increase its headcount to service those partnerships and go after more, Anderson said.\n Catch is one startup providing insurance products, and many of the competitors either do a single offering and do it well, like Starship does with health savings accounts, Anderson said. Catch is taking a different approach by offering a platform experience, but going deep on the process, she added. She likens it to Gusto, which provides cloud-based payroll, benefits and human resource management for businesses, in that Catch is an end-to-end experience, but with a focus on an individual person.\n Over the past year, the company\u2019s user base tripled, driven by people taking on second jobs and through a partnership with DoorDash. Platform users are also holding onto 5 times their usual balances, a result of setting more goals and needing to save more, Anderson said. Retirement investments and health insurance have grown similarly.\n Going forward, Anderson is already thinking about a Series B, but that won\u2019t come for another couple of years, she said. The company is looking into its own HSA product as well as disability insurance and other products to further differentiate itself from other startups, for example,  Spot,  Super.mx and  Even that all raised venture capital this month to provide benefits.\n Catch would also like to serve a broader audience than just those on the federal marketplace. The co-founders are working on how to do this \u2014 Anderson mentioned there are some \u201cnefarious companies out there\u201d offering medical benefits at rates that can seem too good to be true, but when the customer reads the fine print, finds out that certain medical conditions are not covered.\n \u201cWe are looking at how to put the right thing in there because it does get confusing,\u201d Anderson added. \u201cYoung people have cheaper options, which means they need to make sure they know what they are getting.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-07-30 21:49:21",

new category of food delivery in the U.S. \u2014 \u201cinstant\u201d delivery of essential groceries and other home goods for a flat fee of $1.95, 24 hours a day \u2014 has closed a huge tranche of funding to help it scale its service further across the country and globe. It\u2019s raised $1 billion in a Series H round that values the Philadelphia-based company at $15 billion.\n New backers Blackstone\u2019s Horizons platform, Guggenheim Investments, Hedosophia, and Adage Capital, and previous backers Fidelity Management and Research Company, Softbank Vision Fund 1, Atreides Management, and Eldridge Capital all participated in the round.\n This news confirms our scoop of  last week, when reported on this Series H as it was still being closed.\n  Gopuff said it plans to use the funding to continue expanding in North America, the UK (where it has already  acquired one company, Fancy, and, sources tell us, is acquiring another, Dija), and Europe; on more hiring; and to continue building out the tech platform that bridges an ecosystem that includes customers, drivers, suppliers and distribution centers.\n It currently operates 450 sites across North America and the UK, with includes more than 285 dark stores (or \u201cmicro-fulfillment centers\u201d in Gopuff\u2019s words), plus more than 185 retailers by way of its acquisition of BevMo earlier this year.\n One of the reasons that Gopuff has raised such a large sum is that building out food-based, logistics-fueled, transportation business along all of those parameters is capital-intensive.\n But also, that effort to grow is coming amidst a strong surge of competition. Getir out of Turkey, backed by Sequoia and others and  most recently valued at $7.5 billion, is also aggressively expanding. And just looking at Europe, there are a wave of others such as  Flink,\u00a0 Gorillas,\u00a0 Glovo,\u00a0 Zapp,\u00a0 Cajoo, and  Weezy also bulking up their bank accounts to throw their delivery bags into the ring. (In the U.S., established delivery giants like DoorDash will also be moving deeper into Gopuff\u2019s territory.)\n Gopuff believes it can give all of these and others a run for their money. Founded back in 2013 by Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola \u2014 now co-CEOs \u2014 while they were still in university to fill a gap they saw in the market for students like themselves, Gopuff has expanded well beyond that by catering to anyone looking for a quick and relatively low-cost way of getting essential goods without physically going out to get those items themselves.\n In a stretch of time where many of us were either being ordered by our municipal governments, or acting on our own decisions, to stay in place to curtail the spread of Covid-19, Gopuff\u2019s star rose quickly as an easy way of complying without compromising our consumerist tendencies.\n But Companies like Getir out of Turkey \u2014 which has been around for years also building out a model of \u201cinstant\u201d delivery of essential goods \u2014 have demonstrated that there is staying power to the concept, and that is what Gopuff is betting on, too.\n \u201c Gopuff has quietly built a very strong business and solidified itself as the leading player, continuing to define this evolving category,\u201d said Scott Minerd, Global Chief Investment Officer of Guggenheim Investments, in a statement. \u201cRafael and Yakir are focused on maintaining fiscal responsibility while having the ability to successfully execute on strategic growth opportunities. This measured approach along with  Gopuff\u2019s impressive offering has only just scratched the surface. We are thrilled to support this incredibly strong company and look forward to being part of  Gopuff\u2019s journey and continued expansion.\u201d\n Part of Gopuff\u2019s strategy has been to augment the basic instant delivery of essentials model with more efficient distribution along with a wider vision of what constitutes essentials.\n  Gopuff itself has been on a fundraising tear to finance all of this. It was  only in March that it raised $1.15 billion at an $8.9 billion valuation, which came just months after a $380 million round at a $3.8 billion valuation. Together the three most recent rounds total around $2.5 billion in funding in the space of 10 months, and the idea here seems to be that there may be more of where that came from.\n \u201cAs  Gopuff continues to define the Instant Needs economy, we are thrilled to have new leading global partners onboard, along with the support of our longtime investors. This funding round is further validation of the success of our model and will enable us to continue to do what we do best: deliver an unmatched customer experience,\u201d said Ilishayev in a statement.\n \u201cWe have truly doubled down on our key business priorities, accelerating our geographic expansion by entering new markets in the US and abroad, innovating for our customers, and continuing to invest heavily in our technology, our people, and our partners. We look forward to continuing to enhance the customer experience and to bring the magic of  Gopuff to new customers around the world,\u201d added Yakir Gola .", "posttime": "2021-07-30 21:48:59",

"note_en": "They realized that for all of the benefits, Rhee told TechCrunch that the technology was there, but users were having to manage the complexity of hosting solutions as well as incur the costs associated with a big DevOps team.\n They decided to build out a solution externally and went through Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch, where they found other startup companies trying to do the same.\n  Today, Porter announced $1.5 million in seed funding from Venrock, Translink Capital, Soma Capital and several angel investors. It\u2019s goal is to build a Platform-as-a-Service that any team can use to manage applications in its own cloud, essentially delivering the full flexibility of Kubernetes through a Heroku-like experience.\n Why Heroku? It is the hosting platform that developers are used to, and not just small companies, but also later stage companies. When they want to move to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud or DigitalOcean, Porter will be that bridge, Shim added.\n However, while Heroku is still popular, the pair say companies are thinking the platform is getting outdated because it is standing still technology-wise. Each year, companies move on from the platform due to technical limitations and cost, Rhee said.\n A big part of the bet Porter is taking is not charging users for hosting, and its cost is a pure SaaS product,he said. They aren\u2019t looking to be resellers, so companies can use their own cloud, but Porter will provide the automation and users can pay with their AWS and GCP credits, which gives them flexibility.\n A common pattern is a move into Kubernetes, but \u201cthe zinger we talk about,\u201d is if Heroku was built in 2021, it would have been built on Kubernetes, Shim added.\n  To be that bridge, the company will use the new funding to increase its engineering bandwidth with the goal of \u201cbecoming the de facto standard for all startups.\u201d Shim said.\n Porter\u2019s platform went live in February, and in six months became the sixth-fastest growing open source platform download on GitHub, said Ethan Batraski, partner at Venrock. He met the company through YC and was \u201csuper impressed with Rhee\u2019s and Shim\u2019s vision.\n \u201cHeroku has 100,000 developers, but I believe it has stagnated,\u201d Batraski added. \u201cPorter already has 100 startups on its platform.

Now, researchers from IBM and Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) say they\u2019ve developed a program that can predict how the symptoms of a Parkinson\u2019s disease patient will progress in terms of both timing and severity. In The  Lancet Digital Health journal, they claim the software could transform how doctors help patients manage their symptoms by allowing them to better predict how the disease will progress.\n \u201cOur aim is to use AI to help with patient management and clinical trial design. These goals are important because, despite Parkinson\u2019s prevalence, patients experience a unique variety of motor and non-motor symptoms,\u201d IBM said.\n  The breakthrough wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative, a study the Michael J. Fox Foundation sponsored. IBM describes the dataset, which includes information on more than 1,400 individuals, as the \u201clargest and most robust volume of longitudinal Parkinson\u2019s patient data to date\u201d and says it allowed its AI model to map out complex symptom and progression patterns.\n It\u2019s estimated Parkinson\u2019s disease affects more than 6 million people globally, and there\u2019s currently no known cure for it. IBM Research and MJFF plan to continue work on the AI model. In the future, they hope to make it better at providing more granular characterizations of the various stages of the disease.\n   All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

We operate huge online communities that consist of a number of federated platforms full of incredible people sharing advice and discussing online privacy.\n Our work maintaining PrivacyTools has been extremely difficult of late without access to key assets such as the domain and without the participation of its founder. As a result the team decided to hold a  vote for a new name.\n This name change is the first step in this process of regaining our independence as a community. Eventually, we plan on creating a new legal organization designed around the community to ensure our long-term sustainability. This will take some careful planning and time to get right, but we\u2019re confident we can prevent this from ever happening again, and keep us independent of any one team member.\n This was not an easy decision to make as we would of course have preferred to stick with PrivacyTools and take the organization to new heights, but without control or ownership over key assets such as the privacytools.io domain, that vision was impossible.\n Unfortunately with federated services like Mastodon, Matrix and PeerTube we can&#39;t simply change the domain name for technical reasons. We plan to run these services on the old domain for a while yet.\n As the long-term stability of these services is very much in question, we strongly encourage users of  chat.privacytools.io,  social.privacytools.io,  tube.privacytools.io to switch to other providers as soon as possible. It is possible we might bring these services back under our new domain, but that is yet to be determined.\n Thank you for being with us on this journey, we hope you\u2019ll stick around and see what\u2019s next.", "posttime": "2021-07-30 21:37:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u5177,future,\u670d\u52a1", "title": "\u9690\u79c1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u672a\u6765", "title_en": "The Future of PrivacyTools", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.privacytools.io/the-future-of-privacytools/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u5177", "future", "\u670d\u52a1"]}]
