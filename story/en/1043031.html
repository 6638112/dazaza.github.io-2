Nakasone, the nation’s top cyberwarrior, reported that the battle against Russian interference in the presidential campaign had posted major successes and exposed the other side’s online weapons, tools and tradecraft.</p><p>选举日，美国最高的网络战士保罗·中曾根将军报告说，与俄罗斯干涉总统大选的斗争取得了重大成功，并暴露了对方的在线武器，工具和工艺。</p><p> “We’ve broadened our operations and feel very good where we’re at right now,” he told journalists.</p><p> 他对记者说：“我们扩大了业务范围，目前处于良好状态。”</p><p> Eight weeks later, General Nakasone and other American officials responsible for cybersecurity are now consumed by what they missed for at least nine months: a hacking, now believed to have affected upward of 250 federal agencies and businesses, that Russia aimed not at the election system but at the rest of the United States government and many large American corporations.</p><p> 八周后，中曾根将军和其他负责网络安全的美国官员现在被至少九个月的失踪所吞没：黑客入侵，据信已经影响了250多个联邦机构和企业，俄罗斯的目的不是选举制度但是在美国政府的其余部分以及许多大型美国公司中。</p><p> Three weeks after the intrusion came to light, American officials are still trying to understand whether what the Russians pulled off was simply an espionage operation inside the systems of the American bureaucracy or something more sinister, inserting “backdoor” access into government agencies, major corporations, the electric grid and laboratories developing and transporting new generations of nuclear weapons.</p><p> 入侵事件曝光三周后，美国官员仍在试图了解俄国人撤出的仅仅是在美国官僚机构内部进行的间谍活动还是更险恶的事情，从而为政府机构，大公司插入了“后门”通道，开发和运输新一代核武器的电网和实验室。</p><p> At a minimum it has set off alarms about the vulnerability of government and private sector networks in the United States to attack and raised questions about how and why the nation’s cyberdefenses failed so spectacularly.</p><p> 至少，它引发了有关美国政府和私营部门网络容易受到攻击的警报，并引发了有关美国网络防御如何以及为何如此惨败的问题。</p><p> Those questions have taken on particular urgency given that the breach was not detected by any of the government agencies that share responsibility for cyberdefense — the military’s Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, both of which are run by General Nakasone, and the Department of Homeland Security — but by a private cybersecurity company, FireEye.</p><p> 鉴于没有共同承担网络防御责任的任何政府机构都发现了这些漏洞，因此这些问题显得尤为紧迫-军事部门的网络司令部和国家安全局均由中曾根将军和国土部负责管理安全性-但由私人网络安全公司FireEye提供。</p><p> “This is looking much, much worse than I first feared,” said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “The size of it keeps expanding. It’s clear the United States government missed it.”</p><p> “这看起来比我最初担心的要糟糕得多，”弗吉尼亚州民主党参议员，参议院情报委员会排名成员马克·沃纳说。 “它的规模不断扩大。显然，美国政府没有这样做。” </p><p> “And if FireEye had not come forward,” he added, “I’m not sure we would be fully aware of it to this day.”</p><p>他补充说：“如果FireEye没有挺身而出，我不确定今天是否会充分意识到这一点。”</p><p> Interviews with key players investigating what intelligence agencies believe to be an operation by Russia’s S.V.R. intelligence service revealed these points:</p><p> 与主要参与者的访谈，调查了哪些情报机构认为这是俄罗斯S.V.R.的行动。情报部门透露了以下几点：</p><p> The breach is far broader than first believed. Initial estimates were that Russia sent its probes only into a few dozen of the 18,000 government and private networks they gained access to when they inserted code into network management software made by a Texas company named SolarWinds. But as businesses like Amazon and Microsoft that provide cloud services dig deeper for evidence, it now appears Russia exploited multiple layers of the supply chain to gain access to as many as 250 networks.</p><p> 违反的范围比最初认为的要广泛得多。最初的估计是，俄罗斯将代码插入德克萨斯州一家名为SolarWinds的公司生产的网络管理软件时，仅向他们访问的18,000个政府和私有网络中的几十个发送了调查。但是，随着提供云服务的亚马逊和微软等公司越来越深入地寻找证据，现在看来，俄罗斯利用了供应链的多层结构来访问多达250个网络。</p><p> The hackers managed their intrusion from servers inside the United States, exploiting legal prohibitions on the National Security Agency from engaging in domestic surveillance and eluding cyberdefenses deployed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p> 骇客利用美国国家安全局（National Security Agency）的法律禁令从事国内监视，并掩盖了国土安全部部署的网络防御，以管理来自美国内部服务器的入侵。</p><p> “Early warning” sensors placed by Cyber Command and the National Security Agency deep inside foreign networks to detect brewing attacks clearly failed. There is also no indication yet that any human intelligence alerted the United States to the hacking.</p><p> 网络指挥部和国家安全局在外国网络内部放置的“预警”传感器明显无法识别酿造攻击。还没有迹象表明任何人类情报使美国警惕了这种黑客入侵。</p><p> The government’s emphasis on election defense, while critical in 2020, may have diverted resources and attention from long-brewing problems like protecting the “supply chain” of software. In the private sector, too, companies that were focused on election security, like FireEye and Microsoft, are now revealing that they were breached as part of the larger supply chain attack.</p><p> 政府对选举防御的重视虽然在2020年至关重要，但可能已将长期的问题转移到了资源和注意力上，例如保护软件的“供应链”。在私营部门，FireEye和Microsoft等专注于选举安全的公司现在也透露，它们是大型供应链攻击中的一部分。</p><p> SolarWinds, the company that the hackers used as a conduit for their attacks, had a history of lackluster security for its products, making it an easy target, according to current and former employees and government investigators. Its chief executive, Kevin B. Thompson, who is leaving his job after 11 years, has sidestepped the question of whether his company should have detected the intrusion.</p><p> 据现任和前雇员以及政府调查人员称，SolarWinds是骇客用来进行攻击的渠道，该公司在其产品上的安全性一直很差，因此很容易成为攻击目标。该公司首席执行官凯文·汤普森（Kevin B. Thompson）在工作11年后离职，他回避了自己的公司是否应该发现入侵的问题。 </p><p> Some of the compromised SolarWinds software was engineered in Eastern Europe, and American investigators are now examining whether the incursion originated there, where Russian intelligence operatives are deeply rooted.</p><p>一些被盗用的SolarWinds软件是在东欧设计的，美国调查人员现在正在研究入侵是否起源于俄罗斯情报人员扎根的地方。</p><p> The intentions behind the attack remain shrouded. But with a new administration taking office in three weeks, some analysts say the Russians may be trying to shake Washington’s confidence in the security of its communications and demonstrate their cyberarsenal to gain leverage against President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. before nuclear arms talks.</p><p> 袭击背后的意图仍然笼罩。但是，随着新政府上任三个星期，一些分析人士说，俄罗斯可能试图动摇华盛顿在其通信安全的信心，展示其cyberarsenal获得前核武器谈判对总统当选人拜登的杠杆作用。</p><p> “We still don’t know what Russia’s strategic objectives were,” said Suzanne Spaulding, who was the senior cyberofficial at the Homeland Security Department during the Obama administration. “But we should be concerned that part of this may go beyond reconnaissance. Their goal may be to put themselves in a position to have leverage over the new administration, like holding a gun to our head to deter us from acting to counter Putin.”</p><p> “我们仍然不知道俄罗斯的战略目标是什么，”奥巴马政府任职国土安全部高级网络官员的苏珊娜•斯波丁（Suzanne Spaulding）说。 “但我们应该担心，其中一部分可能会超出侦察范围。他们的目标可能是使自己有能力对新政府发挥杠杆作用，例如高举枪头以阻止我们采取行动对抗普京。”</p><p>  The U.S. government was clearly the main focus of the attack, with the Treasury Department, the State Department, the Commerce Department, the Energy Department and parts of the Pentagon among the agencies confirmed to have been infiltrated. (The Defense Department insists the attacks on its systems were unsuccessful, though it has offered no evidence.)</p><p>  美国政府显然是这次袭击的主要焦点，据证实这些机构已经渗透到了财政部，国务院，商务部，能源部和五角大楼的部分地区。 （尽管国防部没有提供任何证据，但它坚称对其系统的攻击并未成功。）</p><p> But the hacking also breached large numbers of corporations, many of which have yet to step forward. SolarWinds is believed to be one of several supply chain vendors Russia used in the hacking. Microsoft, which had tallied 40 victims as of Dec. 17, initially said that it had not been breached, only to discover this week that it had been — and that resellers of its software had been, too. A previously unreported assessment by Amazon’s intelligence team found the number of victims may have been five times greater, though officials warn some of those may be double counted.</p><p> 但是黑客攻击也违反了许多公司，其中许多公司还没有前进。据信，SolarWinds是俄罗斯用于黑客攻击的几个供应链供应商之一。截至12月17日，已有40名受害者被捕的微软最初表示，它没有受到侵犯，只是在本周才发现它曾经遭到侵犯，而且其软件的经销商也曾遭到侵犯。亚马逊情报团队此前未进行过的评估发现，受害者人数可能是原来的五倍，尽管官员们警告说，其中一些人可能是重复计算的。</p><p> Publicly, officials have said they do not believe the hackers from Russia’s S.V.R. pierced classified systems containing sensitive communications and plans. But privately, officials say they still do not have a clear picture of what might have been stolen.</p><p> 官方已经公开表示，他们不相信来自俄罗斯S.V.R.的黑客。破坏了包含敏感通信和计划的机密系统。但官员私下里说，他们仍然不清楚被盗的可能。</p><p> They said they worried about delicate but unclassified data the hackers might have taken from victims like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including Black Start, the detailed technical blueprints for how the United States plans to restore power in the event of a cataclysmic blackout.</p><p> 他们说，他们担心黑客可能从联邦能源管理委员会等受害人那里获取的精致但未经分类的数据，包括黑启动，这是美国计划在发生灾难性停电后恢复电力的详细技术蓝图。 </p><p> The plans would give Russia a hit list of systems to target to keep power from being restored in an attack like the one it pulled off in Ukraine in 2015, shutting off power for six hours in the dead of winter. Moscow  long ago implanted malware in the American electric grid, and  the United States has done the same to Russia as a deterrent.</p><p>该计划将给俄罗斯提供一系列打击攻击的系统，以防止在2015年在乌克兰袭击时恢复电力供应，在冬天死后将电力切断6个小时。莫斯科很久以前就在美国电网中植入了恶意软件，而美国对俄罗斯也起到了威慑作用。</p><p>  One main focus of the investigation so far has been SolarWinds, the company based in Austin whose software updates the hackers compromised.</p><p>  迄今为止，调查的主要重点是SolarWinds，该公司总部位于奥斯丁，其软件更新了被黑客入侵的软件。</p><p> But the cybersecurity arm of the Department of Homeland Security  concluded the hackers worked through other channels, too. And last week, CrowdStrike, another security company,  revealed that it was also targeted, unsuccessfully, by the same hackers, but through a company that resells Microsoft software.</p><p> 但是国土安全部的网络安全部门得出结论，黑客也通过其他渠道工作。上周，另一家安全公司CrowdStrike透露，同样的黑客也未成功地将它作为目标，但通过一家销售Microsoft软件的公司进行。</p><p> Because resellers are often entrusted to set up clients’ software, they — like SolarWinds — have broad access to Microsoft customers’ networks. As a result, they can be an ideal Trojan horse for Russia’s hackers. Intelligence officials have expressed anger that Microsoft did not detect the attack earlier; the company, which said Thursday that the hackers  viewed its source code, has not disclosed which of its products were affected or for how long hackers were inside its network.</p><p> 由于经常委托转售商来设置客户的软件，因此像SolarWinds一样，他们可以广泛访问Microsoft客户的网络。结果，它们可以成为俄罗斯黑客的理想特洛伊木马。情报官员对微软没有及早发现攻击感到愤怒。该公司周四表示，黑客已经查看了其源代码，但尚未透露其哪些产品受到了影响或黑客进入其网络已有多长时间。</p><p> “They targeted the weakest points in the supply chain and through our most trusted relationships,” said Glenn Chisholm, a founder of Obsidian Security.</p><p> Obsidian Security创始人Glenn Chisholm说：“他们通过我们最信任的关系锁定了供应链中最薄弱的环节。”</p><p>  Interviews with current and former employees of SolarWinds suggest it was slow to make security a priority, even as its software was adopted by America’s premier cybersecurity company and federal agencies.</p><p>  对SolarWinds现有和前雇员的采访表明，即使将安全软件作为首要任务也很缓慢，尽管其软件已被美国主要的网络安全公司和联邦机构采用。</p><p> Employees say that under Mr. Thompson, an accountant by training and a former chief financial officer, every part of the business was examined for cost savings and common security practices were eschewed because of their expense. His approach helped almost triple SolarWinds’ annual profit margins to more than $453 million in 2019 from $152 million in 2010.</p><p> 员工们说，在汤普森先生（经过培训的会计师和前首席财务官）的领导下，公司业务的每个部分都经过了成本节省检查，由于费用昂贵，避免了常规安全措施。他的方法使SolarWinds的年利润率几乎翻了三番，从2010年的1.52亿美元增至2019年的4.53亿美元。 </p><p> But some of those measures may have put the company and its customers at greater risk for attack. SolarWinds moved much of its engineering to satellite offices in the Czech Republic, Poland and Belarus, where engineers had broad access to the Orion network management software that Russia’s agents compromised.</p><p>但是其中一些措施可能使公司及其客户遭受攻击的风险更大。 SolarWinds将其大部分工程移到了捷克共和国，波兰和白俄罗斯的卫星办公室，在那里工程师可以广泛使用俄罗斯代理商入侵的Orion网络管理软件。</p><p> The company has said only that the manipulation of its software was the work of human hackers rather than of a computer program. It has not publicly addressed the possibility of an insider being involved in the breach.</p><p> 该公司仅表示，操纵软件是黑客的工作，而不是计算机程序。它尚未公开解决内部人员参与违规行为的可能性。</p><p> None of the SolarWinds customers contacted by The New York Times in recent weeks were aware they were reliant on software that was maintained in Eastern Europe. Many said they did not even know they were using SolarWinds software until recently.</p><p> 最近几周《纽约时报》联系的SolarWinds客户中没有一个知道他们依赖东欧维护的软件。许多人说，直到最近他们才知道自己正在使用SolarWinds软件。</p><p> Even with its software installed throughout federal networks, employees said SolarWinds tacked on security only in 2017, under threat of penalty from a new European privacy law. Only then, employees say, did SolarWinds hire its first chief information officer and install a vice president of “security architecture.”</p><p> 员工们说，即使在整个联邦网络中都安装了其软件，SolarWinds还是在2017年才加入安全性，受到新的欧洲隐私法的处罚威胁。员工们说，只有到那时，SolarWinds才聘请其第一任首席信息官并任命“安全架构”副总裁。</p><p> Ian Thornton-Trump, a former cybersecurity adviser at SolarWinds, said he warned management that year that unless it took a more proactive approach to its internal security, a cybersecurity episode would be “catastrophic.” After his basic recommendations were ignored, Mr. Thornton-Trump left the company.</p><p> SolarWinds的前网络安全顾问Ian Thornton-Trump说，他在那年警告管理层，除非采取更积极的内部安全措施，否则网络安全将是“灾难性的”。在他的基本建议被忽略之后，桑顿·特朗普先生离开了公司。</p><p> SolarWinds declined to address questions about the adequacy of its security. In a statement, it said it was a “victim of a highly-sophisticated, complex and targeted cyberattack” and was collaborating closely with law enforcement, intelligence agencies and security experts to investigate.</p><p> SolarWinds拒绝回答有关其安全性是否足够的问题。它在一份声明中说，这是“高度复杂，针对性强的网络攻击的受害者”，并且正在与执法机构，情报机构和安全专家密切合作进行调查。</p><p> But security experts note that it took days after the Russian attack was discovered before SolarWinds’ websites stopped offering clients compromised code.</p><p> 但是安全专家指出，在发现俄国人的攻击之后，SolarWinds的网站停止向客户提供受感染的代码才花了好几天。 </p><p>  Billions of dollars in cybersecurity budgets have flowed in recent years to offensive espionage and pre-emptive action programs, what General Nakasone calls the need to “defend forward” by hacking into adversaries’ networks to get an early look at their operations and to counteract them inside their own networks, before they can attack, if required.</p><p>近年来，数十亿美元的网络安全预算流向了进攻性间谍活动和先发制人的行动计划，中曾根将军称，有必要“入侵”敌人的网络，以尽早了解其行动并采取对策在自己的网络内部，然后根据需要进行攻击。</p><p> But that approach, while hailed as a long-overdue strategy to pre-empt attacks, missed the Russian breach.</p><p> 但是，这种方法虽然被誉为抢先攻击的早就应该采取的策略，但却错过了俄罗斯的入侵。</p><p>  By staging their attacks from servers inside the United States, in some cases using computers in the same town or city as their victims, according to FireEye, the Russians took advantage of limits on the National Security Agency’s authority. Congress has not given the agency or homeland security any authority to enter or defend private sector networks. It was on these networks that S.V.R. operatives were less careful, leaving clues about their intrusions that FireEye was ultimately able to find.</p><p>  根据FireEye的说法，俄罗斯人是从美国境内的服务器发动攻击，有时甚至使用与受害者在同一城镇的计算机，从而利用了国家安全局权限的限制。国会没有授予该机构或国土安全任何进入或捍卫私人部门网络的权限。 S.V.R.正是在这些网络上操作人员不太谨慎，留下了有关FireEye最终能够发现的入侵线索。</p><p> By inserting themselves into the SolarWinds’ Orion update and using custom tools, they also avoided tripping the alarms of the “Einstein” detection system that homeland security deployed across government agencies to catch known malware, and the so-called C.D.M. program that was explicitly devised to alert agencies to suspicious activity.</p><p> 通过将自己插入到SolarWinds的Orion更新中并使用自定义工具，他们还避免了触发“爱因斯坦”检测系统的警报，该系统被国土安全部门部署在政府机构中，以捕获已知的恶意软件，以及所谓的C.D.M.该程序专门设计用于提醒机构注意可疑活动。</p><p> Some intelligence officials are questioning whether the government was so focused on election interference that it created openings elsewhere.</p><p> 一些情报官员质疑政府是否过于关注选举干预，以至于在其他地方创造了空缺。</p><p> Intelligence agencies concluded months ago that Russia had determined it could not infiltrate enough election systems to affect the outcome of elections, and  instead shifted its attention to deflecting ransomware attacks that could disenfranchise voters, and influence operations aimed at sowing discord, stoking doubt about the system’s integrity and changing voters’ minds.</p><p> 情报机构几个月前得出结论，俄罗斯已确定无法渗透足够多的选举系统来影响选举结果，而是将注意力转移到偏转勒索软件攻击上，这可能会使选民失去选举权，并影响旨在播种不和的行动，从而引发对该系统的怀疑。正直和改变选民的想法。</p><p>  The SolarWinds hacking, which began as early as October 2019, and  the intrusion into Microsoft’s resellers, gave Russia a chance to attack the most vulnerable, least defended networks across multiple federal agencies.</p><p>  最早于2019年10月开始的SolarWinds骇客入侵，以及对微软经销商的入侵，使俄罗斯有机会攻击多个联邦机构中最脆弱，防御最少的网络。 </p><p> General Nakasone declined to be interviewed. But a spokesman for the National Security Agency, Charles K. Stadtlander, said: “We don&#39;t consider this as an ‘either/or’ trade-off. The actions, insights and new frameworks constructed during election security efforts have broad positive impacts for the cybersecurity posture of the nation and the U.S. government.”</p><p>中曾根将军拒绝接受采访。但是国家安全局发言人查尔斯·K·斯塔德兰德（Charles K. Stadtlander）说：“我们不认为这是'或非'的取舍。在选举安全工作中构建的行动，见解和新框架对国家和美国政府的网络安全态势产生了广泛的积极影响。”</p><p> In fact, the United States appears to have succeeded in persuading Russia that an attack aimed at changing votes would prompt a costly retaliation. But as the scale of the intrusion comes into focus, it is clear the American government failed to convince Russia there would be a comparable consequence to executing a broad hacking on federal government and corporate networks.</p><p> 实际上，美国似乎已经成功说服了俄罗斯，旨在改变选票的攻击将导致代价高昂的报复。但是，随着入侵规模逐渐成为人们关注的焦点，很明显，美国政府未能说服俄罗斯，对联邦政府和公司网络实施广泛的黑客攻击将产生类似的后果。</p><p>  Intelligence officials say it could be months, years even, before they have a full understanding of the hacking.</p><p>  情报官员说，他们可能需要数月甚至数年才能完全了解这种黑客行为。</p><p> Since  the extraction of a top Kremlin informant in 2017, the C.I.A.’s knowledge of Russian operations has been diminished. And the S.V.R. has remained one of the world’s most capable intelligence services by avoiding electronic communications that could expose its secrets to the National Security Agency, intelligence officials say.</p><p> 自2017年选拔一位克里姆林宫高级情报员以来，CIA对俄罗斯行动的了解已减少。还有S.V.R.情报官员说，通过避免可能会将其机密泄露给国家安全局的电子通信，美国一直是世界上最强大的情报服务之一。</p><p> The best assessments of the S.V.R. have come from the Dutch. In 2014, hackers working for the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service pierced the computers used by the group, watching them for at least a year, and at one point catching them on camera.</p><p> S.V.R.的最佳评估来自荷兰。 2014年，为荷兰通用情报与安全局工作的黑客闯入了该小组使用的计算机，至少观看了一年，然后将其捕获在摄像机上。</p><p> It was the Dutch who helped alert the White House and State Department to an S.V.R. hacking of their systems in 2014 and 2015, and last month, they caught and expelled from the Netherlands two S.V.R. operatives  accused of infiltrating technology companies there. While the group is not known to be destructive, it is notoriously difficult to evict from computer systems it has infiltrated.</p><p> 正是荷兰人帮助白宫和国务院向S.V.R.他们在2014年和2015年对他们的系统进行了黑客攻击，上个月，他们抓获了荷兰的两个S.V.R.并将其驱逐出荷兰。特工被指控渗入那里的技术公司。尽管不知道该组织具有破坏性，但众所周知，很难从其渗透的计算机系统中撤出该组织。</p><p>  When the S.V.R. broke into the unclassified systems at the State Department and White House, Richard Ledgett, then the deputy director of the National Security Agency, said the agency engaged in the digital equivalent of “hand-to-hand combat.” At one point, the S.V.R. gained access to the NetWitness Investigator tool that investigators use to uproot Russian back doors, manipulating it in such a way that the hackers continued to evade detection.</p><p>  当S.V.R.在进入国务院和白宫的未分类系统时，时任国家安全局副局长的理查德·莱奇特（Richard Ledgett）表示，该局从事的是“当场作战”的数字形式。在某一时刻，S.V.R。获得了调查员用来根除俄罗斯后门的NetWitness Investigator工具的访问权限，从而以黑客继续逃避检测的方式进行操作。 </p><p> Investigators said they would assume they had kicked out the S.V.R., only to discover the group had crawled in through another door.</p><p>调查人员说，他们会以为自己已经踢出了S.V.R.，只是发现该组织已经从另一扇门爬进来了。</p><p> Some security experts said that ridding so many sprawling federal agencies of the S.V.R. may be futile and that the only way forward may be to shut systems down and start anew. Others said doing so in the middle of a pandemic would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, and the new administration would have to work to identify and contain every compromised system before it could calibrate a response.</p><p> 一些安全专家说，消除了如此庞大的S.V.R.联邦机构。可能是徒劳的，唯一的解决方法可能是关闭系统并重新启动。其他人则表示，在大流行期间采取这种行动成本高得令人望而却步，而且新政府必须努力确定并遏制每一个受到威胁的系统，然后才能校准应对措施。</p><p> “The S.V.R. is deliberate, they are sophisticated, and they don’t have the same legal restraints as we do here in the West,” said Adam Darrah, a former government intelligence analyst who is now director of intelligence at Vigilante, a security firm.</p><p> “ S.V.R.前政府情报分析师亚当·达拉（Adam Darrah）说道，他现在是安全公司Vigilante的情报主管。</p><p> Sanctions, indictments and other measures, he added, have failed to deter the S.V.R., which has shown it can adapt quickly.</p><p> 他补充说，制裁，起诉和其他措施未能阻止S.V.R.，这表明它可以迅速适应。</p><p> “They are watching us very closely right now,” Mr. Darrah said. “And they will pivot accordingly.”</p><p> 达拉说：“他们现在正在密切关注我们。” “而且他们将相应地进行调整。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/黑客/">#黑客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/俄罗斯/">#俄罗斯</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/来源/">#来源</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
