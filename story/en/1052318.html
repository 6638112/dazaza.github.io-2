It will feature in &#39; Money for nothing and my Tweets for free&#39; in due course:</p><p>我刚刚在Twitter上发布了这个线程。它将在＆＃39中有功能;无所事事，我的推文免费＆＃39;在适当的时候：</p><p> Current debate about inflation isn’t really about whether it’s likely: it isn’t. Instead it’s about whose vision of the future is going to win. Is it going to be the right-wing demand for small government that the inflation fetishists promote, or the one we need? A thread....</p><p> 关于通货膨胀的当前辩论并不是真的关于它是否可能：它不是。相反，它是关于其未来的愿景将获胜。它将成为对小政府的右翼需求，即通胀租赁主义者推广，或我们需要的小政府？一个线程....</p><p> Remember that the inflation that we are talking about is that with regard to consumer prices, which is often related to wages. It does not relate to asset inflation on things like shares, or house prices, which can behave quite differently, as the last decade’s shown.</p><p> 请记住，我们正在谈论的通货膨胀是关于消费者价格，通常与工资有关。它与股票等资产通胀有关，或房价可以表现得非常不同，如去年的表现。</p><p> Since the 1990s central banks have been given the target of keeping inflation low. 2% has been the goal. But in practice as  this diagram shows, the trend was already strongly downward before central banks were given this goal. Achieving it was not a problem as a result.</p><p> 自20世纪90年代中央银行以来，已经赋予了保持通货膨胀低的目标。 2％的目标是目标。但在实践中，随着该图所示，在担任中央银行的目标之前，这种趋势已经强烈向下。实现这不是问题。</p><p>  It’s also important to note interest rate trends.  These have been steadily downward over hundreds of years. There’s no reason to think that central bank control of interest rates has had anything to do with this over the last couple of decades.</p><p>  注意利率趋势也很重要。这些已经稳步下行了数百年。没有理由认为利率的央行控制利率与过去几十年来的这一点有任何关系。</p><p>  There are good reasons to think inflation and interest rates move in line with each other. If inflation is high interest rates need to be higher to pay real rates of return. The fact that the two move together is then unsurprising. But also reassuring, because they do.</p><p>  有很好的理由思考通货膨胀和利率彼此相连。如果通货膨胀是高利率，需要更高，以支付真正的回报率。这两个移动的事实是不熟悉的。但也让人放心，因为他们这样做。</p><p> It is also reassuring that the trend in the data is so persistent. The past does not predict the future, of course. But before I go any further in this thread it is important to say that the onus is on those who say this trend is going to be broken to say why that is the case.</p><p> 它还放心，数据的趋势如此持久。当然，过去没有预测未来。但在我进一步进一步之前，在这个线程中进一步前来，重要的是说ONU是那些说这个趋势将被破坏的人来说，这是理想的。 </p><p> I am not saying that inflation or interest rate rises are impossible in the future but I am suggesting that those who suggesting these are anything but very temporary phenomenon have to explain why the trends of many decades are going to reversed now and for what reason.</p><p>我并不是说未来的通货膨胀或利率上升是不可能的，但我暗示那些建议这些是任何暂时的现象的人都必须解释为什么数十年的趋势现在正在逆转，而且出于什么原因。</p><p> Only two reasons are being given. One is that there is going to be excess demand after coronavirus. The other is that there will be a shortage of supply of goods and services in the economy to meet that demand. My argument in this thread is that neither is likely.</p><p> 只有两个原因。一个是冠状病毒后会有过多的需求。另一方面，在经济中提供商品和服务的供应不足，以满足这种需求。我在这个线程中的论点也不是可能的。</p><p> The first of these ideas says that if demand for a product rises and the supply does not then its price is going to increase. Economists would say this is so basic that no one could really argue with it. So let me do so.</p><p> 这些想法中的第一个说，如果对产品的需求升高，而且供应不会增加其价格将增加。经济学家会说这是如此基础，因为没有人能与之争论。所以让我这样做。</p><p> First, this assumes that there are no alternative products available. The reality is that there usually are. Few things are so essential now that this is not the case. Secondly, this assumes we will not wait for what we want. We often will, and that smooths demand.</p><p> 首先，这假设没有可用的替代产品。现实是通常存在。现在这不是这种情况，这很少有必要。其次，这假设我们不会等待我们想要的东西。我们经常会，平滑需求。</p><p> What is necessary then for inflation to happen is that not just one product must suffer excess demand, but all must. Given that the diversity of products available usually makes supply shortages of this sort unlikely this has to imply something else is happening.</p><p> 对于通货膨胀发生的情况是必要的，这不仅仅是一个产品必须遭受过度的需求，但一切都必须。鉴于可用产品的多样性通常会使这一排序的供应不足，这不太可能意味着别的东西正在发生。</p><p> There are two options that can create this scenario. One is a general breakdown in supply. The other is a general increase in purchasing power. Of course, if they coincide that adds to the risk. That’s the ‘something else’ those predicting inflation think is going to happen.</p><p> 有两个选项可以创建此方案。一个是供应的一般细分。另一个是购买力的一般增加。当然，如果他们重合增加风险。这是预测通胀认为会发生的“别的东西”。</p><p> That something else that is happening is that it is assumed that wages, or spending power, or both are going to rise meaning there will be too much money pursuing too few goods, and so inflation follows. Any shortage in the supply of goods and services would exacerbate this.</p><p> 那些正在发生的事情是假设工资或支出能力，或者两者都会上升意义，追求太少的商品会有太多的钱，因此通货膨胀遵循。货物和服务供应的任何短缺将加剧这一点。 </p><p> Linked to this is the assumption that after the economy reopens there may be some supply disruptions. Part might be enforced e.g. an absence of foreign holidays. Some will be because businesses making what we want have failed. Others will arise because of slow slow restarts.</p><p>链接到这是假设经济重新打开后可能存在一些供应中断。部分可能被强制执行。没有外国假期。有些人是因为企业制作我们想要的东西都失败了。因为重启缓慢缓慢，其他人会出现。</p><p> It may be easier to deal with this part of the issue than wages in the first instance. I would entirely agree that there will be supply disruptions after we get over coronavirus. It’s impossible for it to be otherwise. Nothing works smoothly after such a massive close down.</p><p> 在第一次实例中处理这些部分的问题可能更容易。我完全同意我们越过冠状病毒后会有供应中断。否则是不可能的。在如此巨大的接近后，没有什么顺利工作。</p><p> But is it really plausible that we are going to suffer long term supply disruption after coronavirus? I think not. In fact, what the disruption has shown is just how resilient many of those parts of the economy supplying goods are, despite disruption.</p><p> 但是，在冠状病毒后，我们将遭受长期供应中断的真实合理吗？我想不是。事实上，尽管有破坏，那么破坏的中断表明是多么有弹性供应商品的许多部分。</p><p> And given government support much of the missing social economy will also bounce back very quickly, I suspect, when the opportunity is given. We may holiday at home and not abroad. We may even want to, to see friends again. But overall, we will be able to get what we want.</p><p> 而鉴于政府支持大部分遗失的社会经济也将非常迅速地反弹，我怀疑是在给出的机会时。我们可能在家里没有国外假期。我们甚至可能想，再次见到朋友。但总的来说，我们将能够得到我们想要的东西。</p><p> Brexit, of course, does not help in this scenario. But it is very largely a one-off shock. For inflation purposes the impact will probably be short lived and unlikely to last more than 12 months. Such things happen. But they are not indications of underlying inflation problems.</p><p> 当然，BREXIT在这种情况下没有帮助。但它很大程度上是一次性休克。对于通货膨胀目的，影响可能很短暂，不太可能持续超过12个月。这样的事情发生了。但他们不是潜在的通胀问题的迹象。</p><p> The assumption that we face long term supply constraints does not stack then. If either Brexit of coronavirus cause an inflation blip it will not last, and we need not worry about it in that case. So neither is the ‘something else’ that must be motivating inflation fears.</p><p> 我们面临长期供应限制的假设并不堆叠。如果冠状病毒的任何一种，导致通胀昙花一现，它不会持久，我们在这种情况下我们不必担心。所以也不是“别的东西”，必须激励通胀恐惧。</p><p> The ‘something else’ must, as a consequence relate to either a general increase in wages or a general increases in buying power in the economy not related to wages, but which might have the same effect of creating an overall increase in demand. Both options need to be considered.</p><p> 因此，“别的东西”必须涉及工资的一般增加或一般增加与工资无关的经济的普遍增加，但这可能具有相同的效果，即创造需求的总体增加。需要考虑两种选项。 </p><p> Serious wage increases are incredibly unlikely at present. When nurses are offered a 1% pay rise and other public employees none at all because there is no private sector wage inflation anyone suggesting wages will be the cause of inflation is seriously misreading the evidence.</p><p>目前，严重的工资增加不太可能。当护士提供1％的报酬和其他公共雇员时都没有因为没有私营部门工资通胀，任何建议工资将是通货膨胀的原因严重误读了证据。</p><p> Anyone making that claim is also ignoring the state of UK unemployment. The government claims that this might reach a peak of in excess of 2 million people, but that claim is not a proper reflection of the truth.</p><p> 任何让那种索赔的人也忽略了英国失业的状态。政府声称这可能达到超过200万人的高峰，但声称不是对真理的正确反映。</p><p> Almost 5 million people are furloughed at present, and realistically some of them may not return to work when the crisis is over.</p><p> 目前近500万人令人垂涎，当危机结束时，一些人可能不会重返工作岗位。</p><p> In addition, more than 2 million self employed people are receiving support because their businesses have suffered as a result of coronavirus.</p><p> 此外，200多万自雇人士正在接受支持，因为他们的企业因冠心病而受到痛苦。</p><p> It’s also been widely reported that millions of people have not qualified for employment help during this crisis. The precise number is, of course, not known.</p><p> 它也得到了广泛报道，在这场危机期间，数百万人没有资格获得就业帮助。当然，确切的数量是不知道的。</p><p> Add all these up though and more than 10 million people are in vulnerable employment situations right now. Many of them will be looking for work when the opportunity arises once the coronavirus recovery gets underway. Many will be looking for the security of a regular wage again.</p><p> 尽管如此，添加所有这些，现在有超过1000万人在脆弱的就业情况下。当冠状病毒恢复正在进行时，其中许多人都会在寻找工作。许多人将再次寻找正常工资的安全性。</p><p> Put all those factors together and one in three people in the UK work force are highly likely to be looking for some change in their work, including a job change right now. And that makes serious wages increases very unlikely.</p><p> 将所有这些因素放在一起，英国劳动力三分之一的人很可能正在寻找他们的工作的一些变化，包括现在工作更改。这使得严重的工资不太可能增加。 </p><p> When there is a mass of willing and able labour looking for work - as is going to be the case in the UK over the coming years as people seek security after this crisis - the likelihood of wage inflation is very low.</p><p>当有大量的愿意和能够寻找工作时 - 就像人们在这场危机后寻求安全性的那样，即将成为英国的情况 - 工资通胀的可能性非常低。</p><p> To summarise then, supply issues that might push up inflation look to be pretty unlikely right now. And so too do wage increases that might push up inflation look very unlikely. So what else might create that inflation?</p><p> 总而言之，提供可能推高通货膨胀的问题看起来现在不太可能。因此，工资可能会增加通胀看起来非常不可能。那么还有什么可能创造这种通货膨胀？</p><p> There is one other cause that I mentioned earlier in this thread. This is a general increase in buying power not related to wages, but which might have the same effect of creating an overall increase in demand. This is what the inflation fetishists are really worried about.</p><p> 我在这个帖子前面提到的另一个原因。这是一般性增加购买与工资无关的权力，但这可能具有创造需求总体增加的相同效果。这就是通货膨胀癖者真正担心的东西。</p><p> Despite the fact that supply is likely to meet most demand without disruption and despite the fact that wages are not going to increase much those obsessed by inflation think that demand is going to rise in the economy. And that is, they think, all down to government stimulus.</p><p> 尽管供应可能会满足大多数需求而不会中断，尽管工资不会增加这些通胀患者认为需求将会在经济上升。也就是说，他们认为，全部到政府刺激。</p><p> It is indisputable that the UK government has injected record amounts into the UK economy over the last year. Around £400 billion has been spent. More has also been made available by government backed loan schemes which are not a cost as yet.</p><p> 在过去的一年内，英国政府在英国经济中注入了纪录金额是不可争议的。花了大约4000亿英镑。政府支持贷款计划也提供了更多的价格，这不是尚未费用。</p><p> It’s also true that in some countries, like the USA, this stimulus continues. Biden is continuing to pump dollars into the economy in a way the UK government has now announced it wishes to stop doing by the autumn of this year.</p><p> 这也是如此，在一些国家，如美国，这种刺激仍在继续。拜登正在继续利用英国政府现已宣布愿意在今年秋季停止做的方式进入经济。</p><p> The question is whether this stimulus will create buying power that might create general levels of price increase even though there are unlikely to be any major supply shortages. The answer is that this is incredibly unlikely, but why this is the case needs to be explained.</p><p> 问题是，即使不太可能是任何主要供应短缺，这种刺激是否会创造可能创造一般价格上涨水平的购买力。答案是，这非常不可能，但为什么需要解释这一点。 </p><p> First, let’s be clear that deficits were necessary. Without them vast numbers of people could not have stopped working. That was necessary to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Without that happening many more people would have died. The NHS would have failed, without a doubt.</p><p>首先，让我们清楚赤字是必要的。没有他们，大量的人无法停止工作。这是为了防止冠状病毒的传播。没有那种情况发生了更多的人会死亡。毫无疑问，NHS会失败。</p><p> Second, since more than 80% of the UK’s businesses, and a higher promotion of employers, received government support it is fair to assume that a significant number of businesses would have failed during the lockdowns that were necessary to save life and the NHS but for this help.</p><p> 其次，由于英国的80％以上的企业，以及雇主的更高促进，获得政府支持，这是公平的，假设在拯救生命和NHS所必需的锁定期间，大量企业将失败，但是这种帮助。</p><p>  And fourth, whilst it’s unpopular to say so, we still don’t know that we have won this battle as yet. England might have a roadmap out of lockdown, but many countries are now going back into it. It is far from clear that this crisis is over as yet.</p><p>  第四个，虽然这是不可平的，但我们仍然不知道我们还赢得了这场战斗。英格兰可能会锁定路线图，但现在许多国家都将重新进入。很明显，这场危机还已经结束了。</p><p> So, the spend was essential. And so too was the quantitative easing that funded it. I’ve already explained this in other threads, so I won’t do so again here.  See this thread instead.</p><p> 所以，花费至关重要。因此，资助它的量化宽松程度也是如此。我已经在其他线程中已经解释过这个，所以我不会再这样做了。请参阅此线程。</p><p> I have also explained how the money that was required to fund these deficits was created. That  explanation is in this thread, amongst others.</p><p> 我还解释了如何创建资助这些赤字所需的资金。那个解释在这个帖子中，其中包括在内。</p><p> The point is, that what quantitative easing did was create new money. This is indisputable. That’s what the Bank of England says it does. That’s not news then. Or a shock. It’s a statement of fact.</p><p> 重点是，量化宽松的确实是创造新的钱。这是无可争辩的。这就是英格兰银行所说的。那不是新闻。或休克。这是一个事实的陈述。</p><p> But what is not a fact is that this leads to inflation, as some economists claim. They quote the quantity theory of money. This is a piece of economics that says if there is more money chasing the same quantity of goods prices go up. This is why they say we face inflation now.</p><p> 但是，随着一些经济学家要求，这不是一个事实是这导致通货膨胀。他们引用了数量的金钱理论。这是一块经济学，说如果有更多的钱追逐相同数量的商品价格上涨。这就是为什么他们说我们现在面对通货膨胀。 </p><p> They note that quantitative easing (QE) creates money without any more work being done and without any extra tax being due so they argue that this must lead to inflation. But they are wrong, for a number of reasons.</p><p>他们注意到量化宽松（QE）在没有任何工作的情况下创造了资金，并且没有任何额外的税，所以他们认为这必须导致通货膨胀。但由于一些原因，他们错了。</p><p> The most important reason is that they assume the government creates all money when making their claim. It is true that the government is important when money creation is being considered but it most certainly does not create all money. That’s because banks also create money.</p><p> 最重要的原因是他们认为政府在提出索赔时创造所有的钱。确实，政府在被认为是赚钱的时候很重要，但最肯定不会创造所有的钱。那是因为银行也创造了钱。</p><p> Banks create money by lending. That is how all money is created. So, when lending increases the money supply goes up. The corollary is that when loans are repaid then the money supply goes down. There are few other rules in economics as basic as that.</p><p> 银行通过贷款创造金钱。这就是所有钱的创造方式。因此，当贷款增加时，货币供应上涨。推论是，当贷款偿还时，货币供应就会掉落。经济学中还有很少的规则是基本的。</p><p> What happened in the last year are four things. First, people stopped borrowing. Consumers spent less (more than 20% less, on average) so of course their borrowing went down. The result was simple. The money supply was reduced as a result.</p><p> 去年发生的是四件事。首先，人们停止借钱。消费者花费较少（少20％，平均）当然，他们的借贷倒下了。结果很简单。由于结果减少了货币供应。</p><p> Second, people saved more. Given that the government protected many people’s income that was inevitable if spending went down. And savings reduce the money supply. That’s because loan repayment is saving in economic terms, and because savings take money out of the economy.</p><p> 其次，人们救了更多。鉴于政府保护许多人的收入是不可避免的，如果支出下降。储蓄减少了货币供应。这是因为贷款还款正在经济方面节约，并且由于储蓄扣除了经济。</p><p> Third, government guaranteed lending to support business did not make good this shortfall. It kept business afloat, for sure, but the money created was not enough to tackle the money creation shortfall.</p><p> 第三，政府保证支持业务的贷款并没有做出这种缺口。它肯定会使业务漂浮，但赚取的资金不足以解决金钱创作缺口。</p><p> And, fourth, the government’s own deficits massively boosted savings. This is an issue I have already addressed in another thread, but it’s worth repeating because this issue is so little understood.</p><p> 第四，政府自己的赤字大量提升储蓄。这是我在另一个线程中已经解决的问题，但值得重复，因为这个问题很少理解。 </p><p> When the government runs a deficit it, in effect, borrows. It’s a simple accounting fact that someone must save as a result. This is explained in economics by something called the sectoral balances.  This is the government chart of these in March this year:</p><p>当政府运行赤字时，实际上借钱。这是一个简单的会计事实，即某人必须保存。这在经济学中解释了称为部门余额的东西。这是今年3月份的政府图表：</p><p> The top and bottom halves of this chart are always equal. Savings equals borrowings is a fact. So, as is apparent, the government deficit has to create private savings. And it did. QE just added a twist. In effect the new money QE created went straight into private savings.</p><p> 此图表的顶部和底部始终相等。储蓄等于借贷是一个事实。因此，如此明显，政府赤字必须创造私人储蓄。它确实如此。 QE只是增加了一个扭曲。实际上，创建的新金钱QE直接进入私人储蓄。</p><p> Now, not everyone was fortunate enough to see the benefit of that. In fact, many households are deeper in debt now than a year ago. Many more just got by. But the best off just got richer. That’s what QE does.</p><p> 现在，不是每个人都幸运地看到了它的好处。事实上，许多家庭现在比一年前更深入债务。还有更多刚刚得到了。但是最好的休息吧。这就是QE所做的。</p><p> This bias to the already wealthy within QE was not by chance. The Bank of England says that one of the aims of QE is to increase the value of financial assets, believing that this will increase spending. They achieved asset value increases. The spending increase I will get to.</p><p> 这一偏见在QE内已经富有的穷人并非偶然。英格兰银行表示，QE的一个目标是增加金融资产的价值，相信这将增加支出。他们取得了资产值增加。花费增加我将进入。</p><p> For all the reasons noted, there’s s a glut of savings now. But that is because of the crisis. And it’s because government created money has had to replace privately created in the economy. QE might have increased money supply, but the savings it’s created has reduced it again.</p><p> 出于所有的原因，现在都有一个节省的乐趣。但那是因为危机。而且它是因为政府创造了金钱必须取代经济中的私人创造。 QE可能会增加货币供应，但它创造的节省会再次减少。</p><p> In that case the claim that inflation is about to break out is hard to justify. So far the quantity theory of money is not a sufficient explanation for that. But, the inflation fetishists do not give up there. They still have another argument up their sleeve.</p><p> 在这种情况下，通货膨胀即将破解的案例很难证明。到目前为止，金额的数量理论不是对此的充分解释。但是，通货膨胀租赁主义者没有放弃那里。他们仍然有另一个争论袖子。</p><p> That argument is that this mountain of savings (much of which is held in money form) is all about to be spent. This is where, they say, inflation is going to come from without there being any increase in wages.</p><p> 这一论点是，这座储蓄山（其中大部分持有金钱形式）都是为了花费。他们说，这是在没有任何工资增加的情况下进入的地方。 </p><p> Andy Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England promotes this view. He thinks the economy is a ‘coiled spring’, waiting to burst. It will, he says, do so once Covid is over. Everyone, he thinks, is going on a spending spree of a scale never seen before.</p><p>Andy Haldane是英格兰银行的首席经济学家促进了这个观点。他认为经济是一个“盘绕的春天”，等待爆发。他说，一旦Covid结束了。他认为，每个人都在跳过以前从未见过的规模。</p><p> The government and Office for Budget Responsibility also share this view. That chart on the sectoral balances reveals this. I share it again here.</p><p> 预算责任政府和办公室也分享了这一观点。关于部门余额的图表揭示了这一点。我在这里再次分享它。</p><p> The green line is overseas saving in the UK. The red line is the government’s deficit. The yellow line is business saving / borrowing and the blue line the same thing for households. The but that I am really interested in is the shaded section: the projections.</p><p> 绿线在英国海外储蓄。红线是政府的赤字。黄线是商业储蓄/借用，蓝线对家庭相同。但我真的很感兴趣是阴影部分：预测。</p><p> The government is forecasting that businesses already overburdened with debt because of Covid are going to borrow at near record amounts to fund investment and I can say with near certainty that they won’t be, because banks will not be lending, and that ends that suggestion then.</p><p> 政府预测，由于Covid，企业已经过债务负担过量，因为Covid将在近纪录的金额借入资金投资，我可以近乎确定他们不会，因为银行不会借贷，这结束了这一建议然后。</p><p> The government projection for households is also wrong. By 2022 we are all supposedly going to have given up saving. But after 2008 it took until 2016 for this to happen, and the shock this time has been much more serious. There is simply no way this is going to happen.</p><p> 家庭的政府投标也是错误的。到2022年，我们都认为已经放弃了储蓄。但是在2008年之后，直到2016年才会发生这种情况，这次震惊更加严重。根本无法发生这种情况。</p><p> The reality is that it is much more likely that after initial holidays, days out and meals out with friends that people are actually going to be pretty cautious. That’s precisely because there has been, and is, so much uncertainty, and because people know wages aren’t rising.</p><p> 现实是，在初始假期，与朋友一起出去的初始饭后，人们实际上要非常谨慎，那就更有可能。这正是因为已经存在，并且是如此多的不确定性，而且因为人们知道工资没有上升。</p><p> The exception may be amongst the very wealthy. They, after all, have more of the gains To spend than anyone else. So they might splurge a bit. They’ll relate to the advertising mantra ‘that they’re worth it’. But there’s something quite unusual that we also know about the wealthy.</p><p> 例外可能是富人之间。毕竟，他们比其他任何人都有更多的收益。所以他们可能会挥动一下。他们将与他们值得的广告Mantra'联系起来。但是我们也知道富裕的东西。 </p><p> The wealthy are wealthy precisely because they do not spend all of their savings. That’s not rocket science, but it’s also true. In other words, they will simply not spend enough to create the massive surge in spending the inflation fetishists think is going to happen.</p><p>富人富于富裕，因为他们不花费所有的储蓄。这不是火箭科学，但这也是如此。换句话说，他们将简单地没有花费足以在花费租赁主义者认为会发生的情况下创造大规模的激增。</p><p> The reality is now apparent. Supplies will be sufficient to meet what demand there is. Wages are not going to go up. People will save still because they are worried about their jobs. And the wealthy simply can’t spend enough to create inflation.</p><p> 现实现在很明显。用品足以满足有什么要求。工资不会上涨。人们仍然可以节省，因为他们担心自己的工作。而富人根本不能花费足以创造通货膨胀。</p><p> I seriously doubt that anything much can create the persistent likelihood of inflation now. In that case one finally question has to be asked, and that is will interest rates be increased? Around the world markets think that likely. But again I have to disagree.</p><p> 我认真怀疑现在可以造成任何东西可以创造持续的通货膨胀可能性。在这种情况下，必须询问一个问题，这是将增加利率？世界各地的市场认为可能。但我再次不同意。</p><p> Part of the reason why markets think interest rates will rise is because they think inflation will, and as I have noted these two are related. If I am right on inflation interest rates will not increase either.</p><p> 部分市场认为利率将上升的部分是因为他们认为通货膨胀率将会，并且正如我所指出的那两个与之相关。如果我对通货膨胀的权利，利率也不会增加。</p><p> Even if we do get a short term increase in inflation e.g. because of Brexit, I do not see rates rising. The reality is that inflation has been well below target for a long time now. That means that the Bank of England can tolerate temporary upward blips without increasing rates.</p><p> 即使我们确实得到了通货膨胀的短期增加。因为Brexit，我看不到涨价。现实是，现在很长一段时间的通货膨胀很远。这意味着英格兰银行可以容忍临时向上的薄层而不增加速率。</p><p> There has to be a persistent threat for that increase to happen. And again, the lack of any real chance that business will borrow or households spend to the extent that the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests also suggests that there is no real threat of that happening.</p><p> 必须有一种持续的威胁，这增加了发生。又一次，缺乏任何真正的机会，商业将借用或家庭花费的程度，即预算责任办公室也表明，没有真正的发生这种情况。</p><p> In that case I cannot see any realistic chance of any significant increase in interest rates either. I could be wrong: all economic forecasting has to be caveated with the condition that ‘it all depends on how events work out’, but I just don’t see it right now.</p><p> 在这种情况下，我看不出任何重要的利率增加的现实机会。我可能是错的：所有经济预测都必须被认为是“这一切都取决于事件如何解决的问题”，但我现在只是没有看到它。 </p><p> The reality is that the inflation fetishists are making their claims not because they believe in them but because they are living in fear of something quite different, and that is that the size of the state might grow after Covid.</p><p>现实是，通胀租赁主义者正在使他们的索赔不是因为他们相信它们，而是因为他们害怕有些不同的东西，这就是州的大小可能在科米德之后生长。</p><p> The state is what the inflation fetishists really hate. And what they know is that society wants a bigger state right now. So they are using a false claim about inflation to try to prevent it happening. And they could win. As excuses go this is a winner, in their opinion.</p><p> 国家是通货膨胀癖者真正讨厌的。他们所知道的是，社会现在想要一个更大的州。因此，他们正在使用关于通货膨胀的虚假主张，以防止它发生。他们可以赢。随着借口，在他们看来，这是一个胜利者。</p><p> But it’s only a winner if we believe them, and there is no reason to do that. There are no real grounds to fear inflation. But there is every reason to believe that we need more spending on many aspects for what the state alone can supply.</p><p> 但如果我们相信他们，这只是一个赢家，并且没有理由这样做。没有真正的理由是恐惧通胀。但是，有一个原因相信我们需要更多的支出，以便独自能够提供的许多方面。</p><p> The battle over inflation risk is not really about whether it’s likely. It’s about whose vision of the future is going to win. Is it going to be the right-wing demand for small government that the inflation fetishists promote or the one that we need? That’s why this is important.</p><p> 对通胀风险的战斗并不是真的关于它是否可能。这是关于其未来的愿景将赢得胜利。它将成为对小政府的右翼需求，即通胀租赁主义者推广或我们需要的小政府？这就是为什么这很重要。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2021/03/14/why-inflation-is-not-a-threat/">https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2021/03/14/why-inflation-is-not-a-threat/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/通货膨胀/">#通货膨胀</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/inflation/">#inflation</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/增加/">#增加</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
