They spent years looking for  rockstar developers, only to realize that the developers they should have been searching for are actually  ninjas. When they finally found where ninja developers live, and learned to speak the ninja language, the target moved once again. Right now, the thing they need to hunt is called a  10x engineer. But what exactly is a 10x engineer? How do you identify one?</p><p>有时候，我为我们的招聘团队感到遗憾。他们花了几年时间寻找摇滚明星开发者，才意识到他们本来应该寻找的开发者实际上是忍者。当他们终于找到忍者开发者居住的地方，并学会说忍者语言时，目标又再次转移。现在，他们需要狩猎的东西称为10倍工程师。但是10倍工程师究竟是什么？您如何识别一个？</p><p> Looking from the other di  rection, as a software engineer, if so many employers are looking for 10x engineers and some are willing to pay them 5x or even more, it’s only natural that I would do my best to become one. But what exactly does it take? Is there a set of skills or some kind of “10x criteria”?</p><p> 从另一个方向来看，作为软件工程师，如果有那么多的雇主正在寻找10倍的工程师，而有些人愿意付给他们5倍甚至更多的薪水，我很自然地会尽我所能成为一名。但是究竟需要什么呢？是否有一套技能或某种“ 10倍标准”？</p><p>   If you ask the head hunters what does 10x engineer means, they will probably say something like “ Productivity! 10x is an engineer that can complete a task 10 times faster”. This sounds great, but before paying the 5x salary, I just have 2 quick questions:</p><p>   如果您问猎头公司10倍工程师的意思，他们可能会说“生产力！ 10x是可以更快完成任务10倍的工程师。”这听起来不错，但是在支付5倍的薪水之前，我只想问两个简单的问题：</p><p> When we say “ 10 times faster”, what is our  baseline and to whom are we comparing?</p><p> 当我们说“快10倍”时，我们的基准线是什么？与谁比较？</p><p> Is it “ 10 times faster” for any task our team has, or just for  specific tasks?</p><p> 对于我们团队执行的任何任务还是仅针对特定任务，速度快“十倍”吗？</p><p> Now, don’t get me wrong. I do believe that there are software engineers that can make a  huge impact on our  product, on our  team, and eventually on our  business. In some cases, a single uniquely talented engineer can be the difference between winning and losing. I have seen this happening and I will share two examples in this article. I can also share that as an engineering manager leading a fairly large team (currently at  WalkMe we are over 200 engineers), I am investing a significant portion of my time in finding uniquely talented engineers and helping them take their best career decision which is to join our team. But I am not looking for engineers that can complete any task 10 times faster. I am looking for a different kind of magic.</p><p>现在，不要误会我的意思。我确实相信会有软件工程师能够对我们的产品，我们的团队以及最终对我们的业务产生巨大影响。在某些情况下，只有一个独特的才华横溢的工程师才能胜出。我已经看到了这种情况，我将在本文中分享两个示例。我也可以分享一下，作为一名工程经理带领一个相当大的团队（目前在WalkMe，我们有200多名工程师），我将大量的时间用于寻找有才华的工程师，并帮助他们做出最佳职业决策，加入我们的团队。但是我并不是在寻找能够将任何任务快十倍完成任务的工程师。我正在寻找另一种魔法。</p><p>   The way I see it, there are two types of 10x engineers. I will explain my theory and dive deeper into each of these two types, including a concrete example from people I worked with and teams I led.</p><p>   我的看法是，有两种类型的10x工程师。我将解释我的理论，并更深入地研究这两种类型，包括与我一起工作的人和我领导的团队的具体示例。</p><p> Let me start by saying that both 10x types are valuable and that in most engineering orgs you  need both of them. I would also claim that there are several personality attributes and behavioral patterns that are commonly found in both types of 10x engineers. But in terms of the  type of excellence they bring to the table, they are completely different from each other.</p><p> 首先，我要说两种10x类型都很有价值，在大多数工程组织中，您都需要它们。我还要声称，在两种类型的10x工程师中通常都可以找到几种个性属性和行为模式。但是就他们带来的卓越表现而言，它们彼此完全不同。</p><p>  I want to take you back to 2012. I was working for HP, leading the R&amp;D group for a product called  UCMDB. The product’s main value prop was providing Ops people with a near-realtime picture of the topology of the infrastructure and applications they were operating.</p><p>  我想带您回到2012年。我曾在HP工作，领导研发小组UCMDB产品。该产品的主要价值支柱是为Ops人员提供他们正在操作的基础架构和应用程序拓扑的近乎实时的图像。</p><p> The data we were collecting and storing was super valuable, the only problem was that in order to actually be able to use this data the user had to be both an expert in graph theory as well as have an intimate knowledge of our proprietary data model. In reality, the  learning curve was so steep, that most of our customers had no more than 3 people who were able to query the data. All other potential data consumers had to “submit a request for a UCMDB view” and wait for these honorable 3 admins to prepare it for them. Not a very efficient way to consume real-time data.</p><p> 我们正在收集和存储的数据非常有价值，唯一的问题是，为了能够实际使用此数据，用户必须既是图论专家，又要对我们专有的数据模型有深入的了解。实际上，学习曲线是如此陡峭，以至于我们的大多数客户最多只能有3个人能够查询数据。所有其他潜在的数据使用者都必须“提交请求以获取UCMDB视图”，并等待这3位尊敬的管理员为他们做准备。这不是一种使用实时数据的非常有效的方法。</p><p>  After a few failed attempts to simplify the query language plus a series of cosmetic UI changes that miserably failed to bring more users into a very advanced application, we decide to take a different direction:</p><p>在简化查询语言的几次尝试失败后，加上一系列外观精美的UI更改，这些更改最终使更多的用户无法使用非常高级的应用程序，但不幸的是，我们决定采取不同的方向：</p><p> Instead of our old and  heavyweight application (huge java applet) that could only run on strong desktops, we wanted a modern and  lightweight web application that can run on any device including tablets and smartphones.</p><p> 与其使用只能在强大的台式机上运行的笨重的旧应用程序（巨大的Java applet），我们不希望使用一种现代且轻巧的Web应用程序，该应用程序可以在包括平板电脑和智能手机在内的任何设备上运行。</p><p> Instead of a super  complex query creation experience that was based on pattern matching on directed graphs, we wanted a  simple query creation experience that is based on natural language search.</p><p> 我们希望获得一种基于自然语言搜索的简单查询创建体验，而不是基于有向图上的模式匹配的超复杂查询创建体验。</p><p> Instead of the  old-fashioned query results consumption interface with multiple tabs and huge results tables, we wanted a  modern interface that presents only the important data points and then helps the user to navigate and extract more information.</p><p> 代替具有多个选项卡和庞大的结果表的老式查询结果使用界面，我们希望使用一种现代界面，该界面仅显示重要数据点，然后帮助用户导航和提取更多信息。</p><p> Instead of our  slow-paced  release cycle (a version every 6 months), we wanted to be able to  continuously release new features and have a short feedback loop.</p><p> 而不是我们缓慢的发布周期（每6个月一个版本），我们希望能够持续发布新功能并缩短反馈周期。</p><p>  But how do you do that? We were aiming to introduce to the market something that isn’t just incremental, but rather a  game-changer capability that will make our product relevant to new use cases and new personas. Clearly, for such an initiative to be successful, we couldn’t use the tech stack, architecture, and dev methodologies that we were using in other areas of our product. We needed something completely different.</p><p>但是，你是怎么做的？我们的目标是向市场推出不仅是增量产品，而且是改变游戏规则的功能，使我们的产品与新的用例和新的角色相关。显然，要使这样的计划取得成功，我们不能使用我们在产品其他领域中使用的技术堆栈，体系结构和开发方法。我们需要完全不同的东西。</p><p> This is where a “ wide &amp; shallow” 10x engineer shines. Before assembling a full  feature team, we assigned him the task of building the  skeleton of the new app. Now I know it sounds a bit strange. How can one person be an expert in so many domains? But in reality, after 4 weeks or so, we had a nice app skeleton, with a search engine that could translate natural language search terms into the existing topological queries, with a simple backend that exposed a RESTful API, and a basic Web fronted (implemented with GWT which was a thing back then). All wrapped with a good CI/CD pipeline and a testing framework (unit, component, E2E) that was based on ideas and tools that were suitable for satisfying our continuous delivery requirement.</p><p> 这是“宽而浅”的10倍工程师大放异彩的地方。在组建一个功能强大的团队之前，我们指定了构建新应用程序框架的任务。现在我知道这听起来有些奇怪。一个人如何成为这么多领域的专家？但是实际上，大约4周后，我们有了一个不错的应用程序框架，其中包含一个搜索引擎，可以将自然语言搜索词转换为现有的拓扑查询，其简单的后端公开了RESTful API，并且使用基本的Web前端（用GWT实施，这在当时是一件很重要的事情。所有这些都包裹着良好的CI / CD管道和测试框架（单元，组件，E2E），该框架基于适合于满足我们持续交付要求的思想和工具。</p><p> This app skeleton created by the 10x engineer wasn’t production-ready. It wasn’t supposed to be. But it gave us a great  starting point for the entire feature team to start from. The 10x engineer who created the skeleton doesn’t just throw it over the fence to the team. Instead, he is becoming part of the team. At this point, his mission is to ramp up the different team members on the tech stack and architecture he chose, in a way that will allow them to become the  experts and the  owners of the product. This is usually done best with 1:1 sessions, tailored to the domain expertise and skill set of each team member.</p><p> 由10x工程师创建的此应用框架尚未投入生产。不应该这样。但这为整个功能团队提供了一个很好的起点。创造骨架的10倍工程师不仅会将其扔到团队的篱笆上。相反，他正在成为团队的一部分。在这一点上，他的任务是增加他选择的技术体系和架构上的不同团队成员，使他们成为专家和产品所有者。通常最好根据一对一团队成员的领域专业知识和技能来进行1：1会话，以达到最佳效果。</p><p> In the UCMDB case, this worked pretty well. The team very quickly ramped up. They embraced many of the ideas and directions that were used in the app skeleton while also changing a few. For some of the team members, this was an opportunity to  learn new technologies and more important to  be coached by a very experienced and talented engineer. After 3 months of focused work by a team of 8 engineers, we released a new product called UCMDB Browser to the market. It was a huge success both from a business perspective as well as from an engineering perspective.</p><p> 在UCMDB的情况下，这非常有效。团队迅速成长起来。他们包含了应用程序框架中使用的许多想法和指导，同时也改变了一些。对于某些团队成员而言，这是学习新技术的机会，而由一位经验丰富且才华横溢的工程师进行指导更为重要。经过由8名工程师组成的团队3个月的重点工作，我们向市场发布了一款名为UCMDB Browser的新产品。无论是从业务角度还是从工程角度来看，这都是巨大的成功。</p><p>   There is a common pattern that I keep on seeing in many engineering teams that are working on successful products and fast-growing businesses. The pattern is not very easy to explain, but generally what happens is that an area in the product that used to be one of your strengths and even a core differentiator from competitors,  gradually becomes very hard to support and maintain. In many cases, It’s not easy to identify the pattern and admit that this is happening to you, especially for people who have been part of the team for a long time. But when you analyze how your resources are allocated, you realize that a nice chunk of your team (developers, support engineers, professional services engineers) are spending most of their time  fighting to keep alive what used to be a core product strength.</p><p>   在许多致力于成功产品和快速发展业务的工程团队中，我一直看到一种普遍的模式。这种模式很难解释，但是通常情况是，产品中曾经是您的优势之一，甚至是与竞争对手不同的核心特征的区域逐渐变得难以支持和维护。在很多情况下，要确定模式并承认这种情况对您来说并不容易，尤其是对于已经加入团队很长时间的人而言。但是，当您分析如何分配资源时，您会意识到团队中的很大一部分（开发人员，支持工程师，专业服务工程师）正在花费大部分时间来保持过去曾经是核心产品优势的力量。</p><p> This common pattern also happened to us in my current team at WalkMe. One of the strengths of our platform is the ability to  identify GUI elements in the hosting application (the application that WalkMe is running on) in an efficient and reliable way. We had a working solution, that was built in the early days of the company (~9 years ago) and was continuously extended and improved since then. It was (and still is) by far better solution than what other vendors (including all our competitors) have in the sense that it was able to identify more GUI elements, faster, and with low overhead on the resource consumption (CPU, memory) of the hosting application.</p><p>在我目前在WalkMe的团队中，这种常见模式也发生在我们身上。我们平台的优势之一就是能够以高效，可靠的方式在托管应用程序（运行WalkMe的应用程序）中识别GUI元素。我们有一个可行的解决方案，该解决方案建于公司成立之初（约9年前），此后一直在不断扩展和改进。从某种意义上说，它能够（而且现在仍然是）比其他供应商（包括我们所有竞争对手）更好的解决方案，因为它能够识别更多的GUI元素，速度更快，并且资源消耗（CPU，内存）的开销很小。托管应用程序。</p><p> With success comes scale. More customers, more data, more use cases. In the domain of GUI element identification, the factors that  added complexity were the requirement to support new UI technologies (Single Page Apps, Shadow DOM, etc.) and the requirement to support highly personalized applications in which the GUI that is presented to each user might be different based on her role, geo-location, or simply her user preferences. Our “Find Element” module was flexible enough to satisfy these requirements (usually by adding plugins for specific UI technologies and platforms), but the amount of  effort that was required to keep this machine running was gradually (but constantly) increasing.</p><p> 成功与规模有关。更多的客户，更多的数据，更多的用例。在GUI元素标识领域，增加复杂性的因素是支持新UI技术（单页面应用程序，Shadow DOM等）的要求以及支持高度个性化的应用程序的要求，其中向每个用户显示GUI根据她的角色，地理位置或只是她的用户偏好，可能会有所不同。我们的“查找元素”模块足够灵活，可以满足这些要求（通常通过添加特定UI技术和平台的插件），但是保持该机器运行所需的工作量正在逐渐（但不断）增加。</p><p>  Identifying the pattern is nice, but doing something about it is the real deal. We understood that we need to build the  next generation of our GUI element identification solution. The primary goal was to improve the accuracy and robustness of element identification. On top of that, we wanted a solution that can evolve beyond just identifying single UI elements, toward understanding context and discover user flows in the application. Much like in the “wide and shallow” example, it was clear that this isn’t an incremental addition to the existing product, but rather a  complete replacement of one of the core engines in our product.</p><p>  识别模式是很好的，但是对此做些真正的事情。我们了解到，我们需要构建下一代的GUI元素标识解决方案。主要目标是提高元素识别的准确性和鲁棒性。最重要的是，我们需要一种解决方案，该解决方案不仅可以识别单个UI元素，还可以理解上下文并发现应用程序中的用户流。就像在“宽而浅”的示例中一样，很明显，这并不是对现有产品的增量添加，而是对我们产品中的核心引擎之一的完全替代。</p><p> But how do you replace the engine while the car is driving full speed? This is where a 10x engineer can make a huge difference. Actually, in our case, it was 2 10x engineers. It all started with a strategic acquisition of a small company called DeepUI. The acquired company was not focused on building the exact thing WalkMe needed, but the 2 engineers that founded DeepUI were  top tier experts in using machine learning for GUI understanding.</p><p> 但是，当汽车全速行驶时，如何更换发动机？这是10倍的工程师可以发挥巨大作用的地方。实际上，在我们的案例中，是2个10倍的工程师。一切始于对一家名为DeepUI的小公司的战略收购。被收购的公司并没有专注于构建WalkMe所需的确切东西，但是创建DeepUI的2位工程师是使用机器学习进行GUI理解的顶级专家。</p><p> The next phase is  research. You want to analyze the existing solution, and understand how it performs with the different use cases. This serves as a “minimal requirement” definition for the new solution, and it may take a few months depending on the complexity of the system. Only then you can design the new solution and build an initial  prototype. As with all “replacing the engine” projects, there is a huge value in being able to run the  new solution alongside the existing solution, in production, and on real data. This is the best way to validate the strength and weaknesses of the new solution. Clearly, this isn’t easy to build, but that exactly why you need 10x engineers.</p><p> 下一阶段是研究。您想分析现有解决方案，并了解其在不同用例下的性能。这是新解决方案的“最低要求”定义，可能需要几个月的时间，具体取决于系统的复杂性。只有这样，您才能设计新的解决方案并构建初始原型。与所有“替换引擎”项目一样，能够在生产环境和实际数据上与现有解决方案一起运行新解决方案具有巨大价值。这是验证新解决方案的优点和缺点的最佳方法。显然，这并不容易构建，但这正是您需要10倍工程师的原因。</p><p> Then comes the really tricky part. You have successfully validated the new solution, and you now want to productize it and start migrating your customers from the old solution to the new one. For this, you must build a team. Suddenly, the 10x engineers need to  switch from being researchers and developers, into being leaders. And not just ordinary leaders, but rather super leaders. Among all types of projects that an engineering org may be involved in, this is the most  complicated and risky type. Replacing the core engine of the product? checked. Introducing a new paradigm (ML)? checked. Impacting the daily work of multiple teams in the company(R&amp;D, Support, Services)? checked.</p><p>然后是真正棘手的部分。您已经成功验证了新解决方案，现在您希望将其产品化并开始将客户从旧解决方案迁移到新解决方案。为此，您必须建立一个团队。突然，十倍的工程师需要从成为研究人员和开发人员转变为成为领导者。不仅是普通领导人，而且是超级领导人。在工程组织可能参与的所有类型的项目中，这是最复杂和风险最高的类型。更换产品的核心引擎？检查。引入新的范例（ML）？检查。对公司中多个团队（研发，支持，服务）的日常工作有影响吗？检查。</p><p> How do you make this switch and build such a team? I don’t think there is one recipe and it’s truly very rare to find people that are capable of doing it. One thing that worked well was offering people that were working in the teams responsible for the legacy solution, to move to the new team that was building the new solution. It worked well because these people were  domain experts, and they understood the huge value of the new solution. They also knew best what it takes to  migrate from the old solution to the new one. Finally, for them personally, it was an opportunity to work with very strong engineers and learn new technologies. At the end of the day, it’s all about people and leadership. The engineers who started the project  really  became 10x engineers only when they managed to create a strong team that can make sure the new solution works in production at scale.</p><p> 您如何进行切换并建立这样的团队？我不认为只有一种配方，找到能够做到这一点的人真的很少。运作良好的一件事是，将负责旧解决方案的团队中的人员提供给正在构建新解决方案的新团队。之所以运作良好，是因为这些人都是领域专家，而且他们了解新解决方案的巨大价值。他们也最清楚从旧解决方案迁移到新解决方案需要什么。最后，对于他们个人而言，这是与非常强大的工程师合作并学习新技术的机会。归根结底，这一切都与人和领导力有关。仅当他们设法组建一支能够确保新解决方案大规模生产的强大团队时，真正开始成为该项目的工程师才是10倍工程师。</p><p> In our case, it worked very well, and we now have a team of ~30 engineers working on DeepUI. The solution is in production, and we are already working on leveraging its potential for additional use cases.</p><p> 在我们的案例中，它工作得非常好，现在我们有一个由30名工程师组成的团队在DeepUI上工作。该解决方案已投入生产，我们已经在努力利用其潜力开发其他用例。</p><p>   Although the two types of 10x engineers are very different in terms of the things they do exceptionally well, there is one thing they have in common: 10x engineers of both types have a huge impact on other people in the team. Here is how they are doing it:</p><p>   尽管两种类型的10x工程师在做得特别出色方面有很大的不同，但是他们有一个共同点：两种类型的10x工程师对团队中的其他人都具有巨大的影响。他们的做法如下：</p><p> Role Model: other engineers want to be like them. It starts with the compensation package they have and goes further to the impact they have on technological decisions being made. Their existence is proof that there is a technical career path, which means that as a good engineer you don’t have to become a manager in order to be promoted.</p><p> 榜样：其他工程师都希望像他们一样。它从他们拥有的补偿方案开始，然后进一步发展到它们对正在制定的技术决策的影响。他们的存在证明了存在技术职业道路，这意味着作为一名优秀工程师，您不必成为经理就可以晋升。</p><p> Standards: since other engineers want to be like them, they will try to replicate their professionalism and adhere to the technical standards they set. You will find that people are actually following their lead, reading their code, using the same design patterns they used, write tests in the same way, document and present their work like them, etc.</p><p>标准：由于其他工程师希望像他们一样，他们将尝试复制自己的专业知识并遵守设定的技术标准。您会发现人们实际上是在跟随他们的领导，阅读他们的代码，使用他们所使用的相同设计模式，以相同的方式编写测试，记录并像他们一样展示他们的工作等。</p><p> Mentoring: it takes one to know one. 10x engineers are very good at detecting junior engineers with the potential to grow and become experts. With a small push, each 10x engineer can  be a great mentor for at least one talented junior developer.</p><p> 指导：认识一个人需要一个。 10x工程师非常善于发现具有成长潜力和成为专家的初级工程师。只需轻轻一推，每个10x工程师就可以成为至少一个才华横溢的初级开发人员的出色导师。</p><p>   10x engineers do exist in reality.  As a manager, finding engineers that can have a 10x effect on your team requires time and focus, but it is well worth the investment. A super talented engineer can  make the entire team 10 times better, similarly to a super talented playmaker taking an average plus football team all the way to the league championship.</p><p>   现实中确实存在10倍的工程师。作为经理，寻找对您的团队有十倍影响的工程师需要时间和精力，但这是值得的投资。一个超级才华的工程师可以使整个团队变得更好10倍，这就像一个超级才华的组织者将平均加上一支橄榄球队一路夺冠一样。</p><p> As an engineer, it is possible to become 10x. You can either take the “wide and shallow” path or the “narrow and deep” path. In both cases, this is going to be a long journey, so pick a domain that you really love. Last but not least, always remember that it’s not only about how much knowledge you have or how great your execution skills as a developer are. Being 10x is all about your ability to  lead other engineers and make them better.</p><p> 作为工程师，有可能变成10倍。您可以采用“宽而浅”的路径，也可以采用“窄而深”的路径。在这两种情况下，这都是一段漫长的历程，因此请选择一个您真正喜欢的领域。最后但并非最不重要的一点是，请始终记住，这不仅是关于您拥有多少知识，还是作为开发人员的执行技能如何。 10倍是您领导其他工程师并使他们变得更好的能力。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://oferka.medium.com/playmaker-the-reality-of-10x-engineer-8af96abce74">https://oferka.medium.com/playmaker-the-reality-of-10x-engineer-8af96abce74</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/工程师/">#工程师</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/playmaker/">#playmaker</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
