It explained how the care sector — defined as economic activity in the home and the market — was a crucial part of the economy but operated differently than other types of businesses.</p><p> 她有理由认为机构可能忽视她的工作。它解释了护理部门如何定义为家庭和市场的经济活动 - 是经济的重要部分，但与其他类型的企业不同。</p><p> You can’t measure the productivity of a child-care center the way you would, say, a car factory, she explained. The incentives are nothing alike. The profits don’t go only to the center’s owner. Instead, benefits are shared by children and their parents, and society as a whole. The country benefits from a more educated and productive work force.</p><p> 她解释说，您无法衡量儿童保育中心的生产力。激励措施无所谓。利润不仅仅是中心的所有者。相反，儿童及其父母和整个社会共享的福利。该国受到更受教育和生产力的劳动力的利益。</p><p> For years mainstream economists, mostly men, had argued that child care or other care work was something women did purely out of love, impossible to think about as an economic issue, she said. “It’s women’s natural inclination or moral duty to do it,” Dr. Folbre said, describing this school of thought.</p><p> 多年来，主流经济学家大多数人认为童心或其他护理工作是女性纯粹出于爱的东西，不可能认为是经济问题，她说。 “这是女性的自然倾向或道德义务，”福尔布雷博士说，描述了这所思想。</p><p> So that 1998 call was a surprise: She had won a “genius” grant for her research. It was the beginning of a very long journey from fringe idea to more mainstream policy.</p><p> 因此，1998年的电话是一个惊喜：她赢得了“天才”的研究。这是从边缘想法到更多主流政策的长途旅程的开始。</p><p> “I had people tell me, you’re throwing your career away,” she said, describing sentiments she heard from fellow economists. “You’re focusing on issues that are just girly issues.”</p><p> “我有人告诉我，你扔掉了你的职业生涯，”她说，描述了她听到来自同胞经济学家的情感。 “你关注刚刚少女问题的问题。”</p><p>  School and child-care closures in the pandemic pushed parents, mostly women, to a breaking point, either out of work or completely overloaded. Ten million mothers of school-age children were out of the work force at the start of the year, an increase of 1.4 million from 2020, according to a report from  the Census Bureau.</p><p>  大流行的学校和幼儿闭合父母，大多是女性，到一个突破点，无论是在工作中还是完全超载。根据人口普查局的一份报告，今年年初的一年母龄儿童占年龄儿童的职业母增于20020年，从2020年增加了140万。 </p><p>  For so long, Dr. Folbre and others sounding the alarm about child care in the United States were shunted to the side of policy conversations. It was left to parents (typically mothers) to figure out who would look after their children so they could get to work. If the United States treated other elements of infrastructure that are critical to the economy the way it does child care, you could imagine the chaos: Car owners would be left building bridges out of duct tape and scrap iron to get to the office, begging close relatives to come by each morning to hold a traffic light up at the corner.</p><p>对于这么久，博士和其他人发出了对美国幼儿护理的恐慌，并被分流在政策谈话方面。它留给了父母（通常是母亲）来弄清楚谁会照顾孩子，所以他们可以上班。如果美国对经济对经济至关重要的基础设施的其他要素，你可以想象混乱：车主将离开管道胶带和废钢到办公室，乞求关闭父亲每天早上都能在拐角处举行交通灯。</p><p> That’s changing. The Biden administration and its allies are pushing the notion that caring for children — and the sick and the elderly — is just as crucial to a functioning economy as any road, electric grid or building. It’s human infrastructure, they argue, echoing a line of thought long articulated by feminist economists (and often ignored).</p><p> 那是改变的。拜登政府及其盟友正在推动照顾儿童的概念 - 病人和老人 - 对运作经济作为任何道路，电网或建筑物的关键是至关重要的。他们争辩说，这是人类基础设施，回应了女权主义经济学家（经常被忽视）的长期思考。</p><p> President Biden included money for home-based care for the elderly and the disabled under the umbrella of infrastructure, as part of a $2 trillion package he proposed in March. The next month, he  proposed more funding for paid family leave, universal pre-K and $225 billion for child care.</p><p> 拜登总统包括在基础设施伞下的老年人和残疾人的金钱，作为他3月提出的2万亿美元的一部分。下个月，他提出了更多为付费家庭休假的资金，通用前K和2.25亿美元用于儿童保育。</p><p> The ambitious legislation is going to face huge hurdles in Congress, but Dr. Folbre, now 68, is both cautiously optimistic and heartened by the culture shift: “I often say to myself I’m glad I lived this long so I can say maybe I had a point.”</p><p> 雄心勃勃的立法将在国会中面临巨大的障碍，但是福尔布雷博士，现在68既谨慎乐观，又被文化转变振作起来：“我经常对自己说，我很高兴我很高兴我能说我可以说我有一个观点。“</p><p>  Mariel Mendez and her husband, David, each the first in their immigrant families to earn college degrees and find rewarding careers, assumed they’d rely on high-quality child care to make everything work. She holds a master’s in public health from Columbia University and works at a nonprofit near Kent, Wash., where they live; he has a master’s in education policy and works as a coach for elementary school teachers.</p><p>  Mariel Mendez和她的丈夫David，每个移民家庭中的第一个赢得大学学位，发现他们认为他们依靠高质量的儿童照顾，使一切都在工作。她在哥伦比亚大学拥有硕士学位，并在肯特，洗涤附近的非营利组织。，他们住的地方;他在教育政策中拥有硕士学位，并作为小学教师的教练。</p><p>  Over the past year, the Mendezes have cycled through four different child-care arrangements for Milea, their 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter, starting with an overcrowded center they felt was unsafe, then a back-and-forth with an in-home day care struggling to survive through the pandemic, and a stressful marathon at home managing remote work and never-ending toddler duty.</p><p>  在过去的一年中，Mendezes循环到Milea，他们的2和半年的女儿的四个不同的儿童安排，从他们感到不安全的过度拥挤的中心开始，然后是一个后退随着家乡的一天，努力通过大流行生存，并在家里管理遥控工作和永无止境的小孩义务的紧张的马拉松。</p><p> “We’re starting to think for our mental health and for our relationship as a family, does it make more sense for one of us to step down, shift to part time?” said Ms. Mendez, 28, who is expecting another baby in June. The prospect of an infant, a full-time job and a still uncertain child-care arrangement is overwhelming. “I never thought I’d be here. That we would all be here,” she said.</p><p> “我们开始思考我们的心理健康，并为我们作为一个家庭的关系，对我们中的一个来说更加有意义，努力转移到兼职吗？” Mendez女士说，28岁，六月期待另一个宝宝。婴儿的前景，全职工作和仍然不确定的儿童保育安排是压倒性的。 “我从未想过我在这里。我们都将在这里，“她说。 </p><p> But in a sense it was inevitable that they would be, since they were headed toward a cliff — with no bridge spanning it.</p><p>但是，从某种意义上说，他们是不可避免的，因为他们被朝着悬崖 - 没有跨越它的桥梁。</p><p> Instead of a public federal early child-care system, akin to those of other developed nations, the United States wound up with a patchwork: a mix of for-profit and nonprofit providers, in centers and private homes. In some areas of the country, child-care deserts, there are shortages of providers and parents contend with long waiting lists and high prices.</p><p> 而不是公共联邦早期儿童保育系统，类似于其他发达国家的国家，美国的拼凑而成：一系列营利性和非营利性提供者，中心和私人住宅。在该国的某些地区，儿童保育沙漠，提供者和家长缺乏等候名单和高价格。</p><p> Yet, the providers themselves operate on a shoestring. The median hourly wage for a child-care worker: $11.65 an hour, according to a  report earlier this year from the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the University of California, Berkeley. Kindergarten teachers make nearly three times as much, $32.80 an hour.</p><p> 然而，提供者本身在鞋带上运行。儿童保育工作人员的中位数小时工资：每小时11.65美元，根据今年早些时候从加利福尼亚大学伯克利加州大学托儿就业中心的报告。幼儿园老师近三倍，每小时32.80美元。</p><p> The Mendezes hit all the snags in the system. They were faced with wait-lists at all their top choice centers when they first moved with their daughter from Boston to the Pacific Northwest in August 2019, before ultimately settling on a place with some reservations. It cost about $1,100 a month.</p><p> Mendezes击中了系统中的所有障碍。他们在2019年8月在2019年8月与他们的女儿从波士顿搬到太平洋西北部的所有最佳选择中心，他们面临着自己的名单。它每月花费约1,100美元。</p><p> They said the place was too crowded and children didn’t seem to get enough attention. “We felt every time we picked her up she was just very anxious,” David Mendez, 29, said. Ms. Mendez said they noticed workers were quitting, too. (Child care, with its low pay, sees high turnover rates.)</p><p> 他们说这个地方太拥挤，孩子们似乎没有得到足够的关注。 “我们每次挑选她的时候都很焦虑，”大卫门卫生29岁，“大卫梅德斯说。 Mendez女士说他们也注意到工人也在戒烟。 （儿童保育，薪酬低，看到营业速度高。）</p><p> The Mendezes believed they were lucky when they found another spot in February 2020 at a day care near their home, based out of the owner’s house. She spoke Spanish. A plus. The couple, both Mexican-American, speak the language and wanted their daughter to grow up bilingual.</p><p> 当他们在他们家附近的一天，他们在2020年2月在他们的家里找到了另一个地方时，梅德斯认为他们很幸运。她说西班牙语。一个好处。这对夫妇，墨西哥 - 美国人，都说语言，希望他们的女儿长大双语。</p><p> “We loved it. We felt so comfortable. Our daughter loved it, too,” said Mr. Mendez. “We saw the change in her. When we dropped her off, she’d just wave and say ‘bye’. Like, ‘it’s time for you guys to go.’”</p><p> “我们爱它。我们觉得很舒服。我们的女儿也喜欢它，“Mendez先生说。 “我们看到了她的变化。当我们把她放下时，她会挥手并说'再见'。喜欢，'是时候让你走了。“ </p><p> Not even a month in, however, the day care’s owner got Covid-19. There was no one else to replace her; so the center shuttered and the Mendezes did that very 2020 thing of trying to work from home, while tag teaming parenting duties.</p><p>然而，甚至没有一个月，当天护理主义者得到了Covid-19。没有其他人可以取代她;所以百叶窗和门塞斯的中心做了2020年，试图在家中工作，而标签团队团结育儿职责。</p><p> Ms. Mendez talks about how she was “lucky” to have a flexible job, so she could log on at 5 a.m. She missed meetings and days at work. They kept Milea home with them for months, while their day care provider recovered and until they were comfortable with the idea of sending her back.</p><p> Mendez女士谈到了她如何“幸运”来拥有灵活的工作，因此她可以在上午5点登录。她错过了在工作中的会议和日子。他们将Milea Home与他们保持过几个月，而他们的日常护理提供者恢复过，直到他们对发送背部的想法感到舒服。</p><p> Mr. Mendez’s mother came up from California to help, but she was working remotely, too. “Between the three of us we shuffled around,” said Ms. Mendez. “It feels like a blur. It felt impossible.”</p><p> Mendez的母亲先生来自加利福尼亚州来帮助，但她也在远程工作。 “我们在我们三个人之间进行洗牌，”Mendez女士说。 “它感觉就像一个模糊。它感到不可能。“</p><p> By June, they took their daughter back to the family child care. That didn’t last.</p><p> 到6月，他们让女儿回到家里的幼儿。那不是持续的。</p><p> Child-care operators were hit hard by Covid. Operating costs rose to deal with new health requirements but revenues sank as many parents became unemployed — or decided to keep children home as the virus spread. By the end of 2020, 13 percent of centers and in-home day cares were closed, according to a  survey released in February.</p><p> 儿童保育运营商被Covid击中。经营成本升起，以处理新的健康要求，但由于许多父母变得失业，或者决定将儿童家庭作为病毒传播。根据二月发布的一项调查，截至2020年底，13％的中心和家庭日子都关注。</p><p> Children started dropping out of the Mendezes’ family center, they said. By December, they learned it would close permanently; the owner was no longer making enough to get by. In January 2021, the Mendezes were once again looking for a child-care bridge so they could keep their jobs.</p><p> 他们说，孩子们开始辍学，他们说。到12月，他们了解到它将永久关闭;业主不再足以获得。 2021年1月，Mendezes再次寻找一个儿童护理桥，所以他们可以保留工作。</p><p> At least with public schools, parents know they’re not going out of business. Early child care is a whole different thing.</p><p> 至少与公立学校，父母知道他们不会出生。早期的育儿是一个完整的不同的东西。 </p><p> Wonders, a center in Corvallis, Ore., that served 45 children, shut its doors in April 2020, sending parents scrambling.</p><p>奇迹，奥勒科尔瓦里斯的一个中心。，奥勒，45名儿童，在2020年4月关闭了大门，送父母争抢。</p><p> “I completely panicked,” said Kate Aronoff, a mental health counselor who lives in Corvallis and sent her two children to Wonders. “It felt like the rug was pulled out from under us. It just kind of baffled me that we were expected to continue working and just figure it out.”</p><p> “我完全恐慌，”凯特阿罗诺夫说，凯特··卫生辅导员（Corvallis），并将她的两个孩子送到奇迹。 “它觉得像我们下面的地毯被拉出。这只是让我有望继续工作，只是搞清楚。“</p><p>   For years, parents and child-care advocates sounded the alarm about the inadequate child-care system in the United States.</p><p>   多年来，父母和父母护理倡导者对美国儿童保育系统不足的恐慌感到震惊。</p><p> “Basically if we can deliver water and electricity and internet to every home in this country we should be able to create good care options for everyone,” Ai-jen Poo, director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and Caring Across Generations, and a leader in the push to treat care as infrastructure, said in a recent interview.</p><p> “基本上，如果我们可以向这个国家的每个家庭提供水和电力和互联网，我们应该能够为每个人创造良好的护理选择，”国家家庭工人联盟和关注各地的主任，以及领导者在最近的面试中表示，在推动治疗作为基础设施时。</p><p> On a call in April, she echoed this notion. “If the definition of infrastructure is that which enables commerce and economic activity, what could be more fundamental?” she asked.</p><p> 在4月份的电话上，她回应了这个概念。 “如果基础设施的定义是能够实现商业和经济活动，可能更重要的是什么？”她问。</p><p> Ms. Poo, another recipient of a  MacArthur “genius” grant, was most likely the first to use the term “infrastructure” to refer to care-related work in her 2015 book “The Age of Dignity,” about caring for the elderly.</p><p> Poo女士，麦克阿尔“Genius”格兰特的另一个受援者，最有可能是第一个使用“基础设施”一词的“2015年”尊严的“尊严的”的关心工作“的关心工作。</p><p> Recently, in thinking about how she came up with the framing, she recalled growing up and watching her mother and grandmother raise her while working nonstop.</p><p> 最近，在思考她如何与框架上来，她回忆起来长大，看着她的母亲和祖母在不间断工作时举起她。 </p><p> “So much of what they did was invisible,” she said. Ms. Poo also recalled getting to college in New York City and watching women of color push white babies in strollers down Riverside Drive. “It’s just this part of the economy that’s been so devalued and to great detriment of everyone involved,” she said.</p><p>“他们所做的那么多是看不见的，”她说。 Poo女士还回忆起在纽约市上大学，并在漫步河畔驾驶室里看着婴儿推车的彩色母婴。 “这只是经济的这一部分，这是如此贬值，并且对所有参与者的损害很大，”她说。</p><p> The same year Ms. Poo’s book was published, Anne-Marie Slaughter cited her work in calling for a care infrastructure in her book, “Unfinished Business,” a follow-up to a viral article she wrote for The Atlantic titled “ Why Women Still Can’t Have It All.”</p><p> 同年，帕诺的书女士出版，安妮 - 玛丽屠杀引用了她在她的书中致电“未完成的事业”的关注基础设施的工作，这是她为大西洋写作的病毒文章的跟进“为什么女性仍然是女性不能拥有它。“</p><p> “It just seems so obvious. Child care is essential for women to be able to work. But in the society we still live in it is not essential for men,” Ms. Slaughter said recently in a phone interview, acknowledging Ms. Poo and Dr. Folbre as giants in this area. “Yet men are defining what infrastructure is.”</p><p> “它似乎似乎如此明显。育儿对女性能够工作至关重要。但在社会中，我们仍然生活在这对男性来说不是必不可少的，“屠宰女士最近说在电话采访中，承认Poo女士和Folbre博士在这一领域的巨人。 “但是男人正在定义基础设施是什么。”</p><p> Men were also devising, and sidelining, child-care policies. The United States came close to public child care nearly 50 years ago, when bipartisan majorities in Congress passed a bill that would have funded a nationwide system. But facing pressure from conservatives, President Richard Nixon vetoed the bill. The legislation had “family-weakening implications,” he said.</p><p> 男性也在设计，侧链，儿童保育政策。当大会的Bipartisan Moreitions通过一项将于全国范围内制度提供资金的法案时，美国近50年前接近公众育儿。但从保守派的面临压力，理查德尼克松总统否决了该法案。他说，立法有“家庭疲软的威胁”。</p><p> As more women arrived in Congress in the intervening years, these issues gained traction, spearheaded by supporters like Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who was a preschool teacher. Care economy issues were also a key part of the campaigns of the four female senators who ran for president in 2020, bringing heightened attention to these policies even before the pandemic increased urgency.</p><p> 随着妇女在中期抵达代表大会的情况下，这些问题获得了牵引，由参议员Patty Murray等支持者，来自华盛顿的民主党人，他是学前教老师。护理经济问题也是在2020年担任总统的四名女性参议员活动的关键部分，即使在大流行增加的紧迫性之前，也会引起这些政策的提高。</p><p> Some conservatives still argue today that women should be home with the children, but it’s an increasingly fringe view. Sixty-five percent of women with preschool and school-aged children work, according to March data calculated by Misty L. Heggeness, a principal economist at the Census Bureau.</p><p> 一些保守派今天仍然争辩说，女性应该和孩子们一起住宅，但这是一个越来越普遍的景色。六十五名妇女患有幼儿园和学龄儿童工作的妇女，根据普查局局的主要经济学家Misty L. Heggeness计算。</p><p> The lack of consistent child care was one factor that  helps explain the higher than expected unemployment numbers released by the Labor Department on Friday.</p><p> 缺乏一致的儿童保育是一个因素，有助于解释劳工部门周五发布的高于预期的失业号码。 </p><p> “I’ve taken my son to work and snuck him in closets because I didn’t have child care,” said Sarah Murphy, 47, who lives with her 8-year-old son, in North Braddock, Pa. Before the pandemic she was working as a cleaner in apartment buildings, and had a side gig as an extra on movie and TV sets.</p><p>“我带着儿子工作，并在壁橱里偷偷摸摸，因为我没有孩子，”萨拉·墨菲说，47，她和她的8岁的儿子住在北布拉德克，帕。大流行前她作为公寓楼的一个清洁工，并在电影和电视机上有一个额外的演出。</p><p> She hasn’t been able to work since, as her son was in virtual school. Recently he started a hybrid program, but that’s unreliable, she said. “I have to be on call in case someone gets sick, they close the school and send them home.”</p><p> 因为她的儿子在虚拟学校，她没有能够工作。最近他开始了一个混合动力车计划，但这是不可靠的，她说。 “如果有人生病，我必须打电话，他们关上学校并将他们送回家。”</p><p> Ms. Murphy doesn’t have the money for child care, which would help her at least interview for work. She’s getting by with stimulus checks and help from her son’s father, who lives nearby. She can’t plan to work in the summer, either, since it’s unclear what her son will be able to do.</p><p> 墨菲女士没有为托儿服务而有钱，这将帮助她至少接受工作。她在她儿子的父亲那里得到了刺激检查和帮助，他住在附近。她也无法在夏天上班，也不清楚她的儿子能够做些什么。</p><p> “What job wants to hire a person who doesn’t know how her summers are going to be?” she said.</p><p> “什么工作要雇用一个不知道她的夏天将是如何成为的人？”她说。</p><p> Kate Davenport, co-president of Eureka Recycling, a nonprofit in Minneapolis, said she’s had staff members quit their jobs since the pandemic because they had children at home and couldn’t come to work. Although she tried to be flexible about hours and offered some the option to work remotely, some employees simply couldn’t do that.</p><p> 凯特·达文波特，尤里卡回收的共同主席，明尼阿波利斯的非营利组织表示，她的工作人员自过流行以来辞掉了工作，因为他们在家里有孩子，不能上班。虽然她试图灵活大约几个小时，但提供了一些可以远程工作的选择，但有些员工根本不能那样做。</p><p>  There were issues with child care even before the pandemic for her staff, Ms. Davenport said. The most frustrating involved something she called the benefit cliff: Some of the very lowest-income parents get subsidies from the federal government to help pay for care; if they earn too much money, however, they lose that benefit.</p><p>  达文波特女士表示，甚至在大流行前有儿童保育问题。涉及她叫做福利悬崖的最令人沮丧的事情：一些最低收入的父母从联邦政府获得补贴，以帮助支付护理;然而，如果他们赚到太多的钱，他们会失去这种益处。</p><p> Ms. Davenport said she’s had many workers turn down promotions because they couldn’t afford to lose child care.</p><p> 达文波特女士表示，她有很多工人拒绝促销，因为他们无法承受丧生育儿。 </p><p> The tension here is what Nancy Folbre and other feminist economists first started working on decades ago, and what policymakers have just caught up with, barely: that a system where working parents do not have reliable, affordable child care is one where they cannot reliably build a career.</p><p>这里的紧张局势是南希和其他女权主义经济学家首次开始在几十年前开始工作，刚刚赶上的政策制定者刚刚赶上，几乎没有：工作父母没有可靠的，经济实惠的儿童保育是他们不能可靠的父母事业。</p><p> Dr. Folbre is optimistic that the country is at a turning point — though she describes herself as “hopeful and worried.”</p><p> Folbre博士很乐观，这个国家处于转折点 - 尽管她将自己描述为“充满希望和担心”。</p><p> “It’s just not clear which way things are going to keep turning,” she said, crediting the Biden administration with recognizing the time had come to recognize care as part of the economy. “We have to keep our shoulder to the wheel.”</p><p> “这只是不清楚的是事情要继续转向，”她说，以认识到的时间来识别拜登行政当局来认识到作为经济的一部分。 “我们必须将肩膀保持在车轮上。”</p><p> The Mendezes, wary of putting their daughter through another change, aren’t looking for another child-care center. “We’re not going to disrupt her again,” Ms. Mendez said.</p><p> 谨慎地将他们的女儿穿过另一个变化，谨慎，不敢寻找另一个儿童保育中心。 “我们不会再次扰乱她，”Mendez女士说。</p><p> They’ve hired a helper from their beloved, now closed, family day care to come to their house. She looks after their daughter and a 4-year-old child who also needed care when the center shut down.</p><p> 他们聘请了一个从他们心爱的人，现在关闭，家庭日的家庭照顾到他们家。她照顾他们的女儿和一个4岁的孩子，当中心关闭时也需要照顾。</p><p> The caregiver doesn’t do the kinds of learning activities that they found at a child-care center, the Mendezes said. So, Ms. Mendez is carving out time to build a curriculum for the children.
