That round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. With the current round, ShipBob has raised $330.5 million.\n  ShipBob offers direct-to-consumer companies a platform that allows them to provide quick delivery like the kind consumers have come to expect from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. and retailer  Walmart\n  The company is one of an array of logistics-focused businesses that have seen surging demand for services amid a pandemic-driven upheaval in retail markets.\n    With consumers stuck at home last year as economies around the world shut down in an attempt to curb the spread of Covid-19, ShipBob, which was founded in 2014, saw a large uptick in the number of customers, according to Chief Executive Dhruv Saxena. He said ShipBob had between 1,200 and 1,500 customers on its platform as it entered 2020. It now has more than 5,000.\n    \u201cPeak season is usually Black Friday through the week before Christmas\u2026 For us, the peak started in May and carried through the entirety of the year,\u201d Mr. Saxena said. He added that even as things reopen, it appears that some e-commerce habits will become permanent.\n  In the last quarter of 2020, ShipBob turned a profit and was cash flow positive for the first time, according to the company.\n  ShipBob\u2019s offerings include a cloud-based platform to manage orders, along with 24 fulfillment centers in the U.S., U.K. and Australia.\n  With the latest round of funding, ShipBob aims to add 35 more fulfillment centers by year\u2019s end.

", "note_en": "The round was co-led by Fireside Ventures (a prominent Indian investor in consumer and hardware tech space) and an unnamed global investor, the Indian startup said, without revealing the other firm\u2019s name. HeyDay, PDS International, Class 5 Global, Secocha Ventures, and founders of  hardware startup boAt (Aman Gupta and Sameer Mehta) also participated in the round. It\u2019s not clear whether the round also includes debt \u2014 as is popular among Thrasio-like ventures \u2014 and if the entire financing is being wired in one tranche.\n 10club acquires small brands that sell their products on e-commerce platforms and scales those businesses.\n  \u201cGreat businesses are growing on the backs of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa and more. They get their foundational years right but find it difficult to scale, and understand that competition is hard to curb.That\u2019s where we step in, allowing you \u2013 the entrepreneurs \u2013 to enjoy an exit and benefit from years of hard work,\u201d the startup describes on its LinkedIn page.\n 10club is one of a few dozen firms that is  attempting to replicate what is popularly known as the Thrasio-model in India. Mensa Brands, a similar venture by former fashion e-commerce Myntra chief executive, recently raised $50 million in equity and debt. TechCrunch  reported earlier this month that UpScale, another prominent player in this space, is in advanced talks with Germany\u2019s Razor Group to raise capital.\n Pity the folks at Thrasio that must be scratching their heads wondering why they&#39;re getting so many hits/mentions from India.  https://t.co/N9r2JYWCyp\n Like Thrasio, several of these firms are trying to acquire brands that sell mid-range to high-end products in categories where competition is limited. In fact, some of the categories that are common among these brands are so under-appreciated that even Amazon and other e-commerce firms have not explored them through their private label ecosystems.\n New York-headquartered Thrasio, which has raised over $1.3 billion in equity and debt since December last year, had acquired or otherwise  consolidated about 6,000 third party sellers on Amazon as of earlier this year.\n \u201cIndia and online-first brands are at the cusp of the next revolution. We, at Fireside, believe that both VC and acquisition driven model will co-exist going forward and can turbocharge the growth of early-stage brands. Together with the team at 10Club, we will be able to drive this change and enable e-commerce entrepreneurs to realize the full potential of their brands,\u201d said Vinay Singh, Partner at Fireside Ventures, in a statement. As part of the deal, Singh is also joining 10club\u2019s board.\n Bhavna Suresh, co-founder of 10club and former chief executive of real-estate marketplace Lamudi, said the startup has already built its foundational pillars of the centralized platform and signed letters of intent worth $15 million from several firms and will deploy the fresh capital to operate the new businesses.\n &#34;Thrasio

", "note_en": "Workforce analytics company Visier has secured $154 million CAD ($125 million USD), becoming the latest Canadian tech startup to surpass a $1 billion valuation.\n The all equity, Series E round was sole-sourced from Goldman Sachs Asset Management and brings Visier\u2019s valuation to $1.2 billion CAD ($1 billion USD).\n  An already profitable company with a healthy bottom line, Visier raised the capital after Goldman Sachs expressed interest in helping the startup optimize for companies facing new human resource (HR) challenges coming out of COVID-19.\n Visier is a Vancouver-based startup that offers cloud-based workforce analytics software. Its tech helps companies build programs and plans focused on employee wellness, retention, and more. The startup was founded in 2010 and currently serves around 8,000 customers, including the likes of Adobe, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, and Uber. Visier is available in more than 75 countries.\n It was created by Ryan Wong (CEO), John Schwarz (chairman), Jan Schwarz, and Brett Schwarz. John Schwarz began his career at IBM, later becoming president of Symantec (now NortonLifeLock). He also led Business Objects, which was acquired by SAP. It was there he worked with Wong, who focused on engineering at both Business Objects and SAP after the merger.\n This Series E capital brings Visier\u2019s total funding to date to $270 million CAD ( $219.5 million USD). Visier\u2019s past investors include Summit Partners, Foundation Capital, Adams Street Partners, BYU Cougar Capital, and Sorenson Capital.\n  In addition to the $154 million in primary capital, Goldman Sachs also bought out around $92 million CAD ($75 million USD) from existing investors. CEO Wong declined to disclose the details of that deal.\n \u201cAccess to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,\u201d said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company\u2019s continued growth.\u201d\n Visier plans to use the capital to ensure it can win big in what it sees as a \u201cswift and massive transformation\u201d occurring in the HR space. Visier sees two major trends in the HR sector: an increased demand placed on organizations to \u201cbetter know, care for, and support their employees\u201d and the need for new recruitment strategies as COVID-19 has created a more distributed workforce.\n \u201cWhen the pandemic is over, the surveys are saying that there will be a change in the workforce,\u201d Wong said in an interview. \u201cI think that turnover is as high as between 25 to 40 percent.\u201d\n \u201cI think it will be headline news that companies will finally wake up in the morning and find they [have lost] that percentage of their workforce,\u201d the CEO added. \u201cAnd it is a real problem. [Visier has] been beating that drum, and telling and warning that is coming because of all the data that we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n \u201cThis whole returning to work is not going to be smooth sailing,\u201d he lamented.\n  The workforce analytics market Visier operates in is expected to reach $5.97 billion USD globally by 2026.  Reports show a surge in investment in workforce analytics from multinational companies and note the demand for workforce analytics software surged during the pandemic, as companies look for ways to ensure productive and efficient management of the workforce amid remote and hybrid work models.\n Companies have been increasingly announcing new hybrid or remote work models, including Shopify, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, PayPal, and Salesforce, which declared the  nine to five workday \u201cdead.\u201d\n Wong pointed to how companies being more willing to hire remote workers can create new challenges as much as it creates new opportunities and access to talent.\n \u201cThe whole recruiting and where we hire has changed completely,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, companies that have a workforce planning or talent strategy on where they recruit and how they actually retain talent and assume the classic way of working [will continue], they will be in shock.\u201d\n In addition to changes brought about by COVID-19, Wong also sees a shift in overall employee culture over the past year, led by social movements. He sees employees demanding more than their employers when it comes to addressing social issues, internally and externally.\n \u201cThe last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n \u201cIn the last 25 years, organizations were very much about profit and loss (P&amp;L),\u201d Wong said. \u201cI think the next 25 years is more than just P&amp;L. It is not acceptable to be just looking at P&amp;L, the social responsibility [expectations] that organizations will put in, by law and by the employee pressure, is very high. The last year, the whole pandemic and the whole social movement, has brought a different contract between employer employees.\u201d\n Many companies, especially in the tech space, have seen employees demanding action on diversity and inclusion and holding their employers more accountable for actions across a wide spectrum of issues. A homegrown example is  Shopify, which has faced long-standing criticisms over some of its company policies.\n \u201cThe partnership with Goldman Sachs on the next phase of Visier\u2019s growth underscores the fact that people analytics has become mainstream business practice,\u201d said Visier chairman John Schwarz. \u201cThis investment is key to establishing Visier as the independent global cloud platform for people related business insights.\u201d\n Visier, a company of more than 400 employees, is looking to use part of the funding to grow its own employee base, globally. The startup plans to hire around 100 workers in the next 12 months and may look to create a Toronto base in addition to its Vancouver headquarters.\n One major use for the Goldman capital will be to create a partner ecosystem within Visier\u2019s existing platform. This is something the company had been working on prior to the Series E round but the launch of which has been accelerated by the injection of capital. Visier plans to launch the platform this summer.\n Visier also plans to make acquisitions using its newfound capital, something that has not been part of its strategy in the past.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u52b3\u52a8\u529b,cad,visier", "title": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u5206\u6790\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684Visier\uff0c\u4eceGoldman Sachs\u83b7\u5f9715400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u7cfb\u5217E\uff0c\u4ee51.2\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684CAD\u4f30\u4ef7 ", "title_en": "Visier, which develops cloud-based workforce analytics software, raises $154M CAD Series E from Goldman Sachs at a $1.2B CAD valuation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://betakit.com/workforce-analytics-startup-visier-secures-154-million-cad-from-goldman-sachs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u52b3\u52a8\u529b", "cad", "visier"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3c56705dcd8765a269238027d3bed46a.jpg", "infoid": 1068562, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5761/\u66fc\u8c376\u670828\u65e5\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09\n \u6cf0\u56fd\u4fdd\u7687\u515a\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u8096\u514b\u6d1b\u5fb7\uff06\uff0334;

Chuenchoopol told Reuters he and a team of 80 volunteers had created the maps and planned to report everyone named on them to police on accusations of insulting the monarchy.\n A spokesperson for Alphabet&#39;s Google  (GOOGL.O) said by email &#34;the issue is now fixed&#34;, and noted: &#34;We have clear policies about what&#39;s acceptable for user generated My Maps content. We remove user generated maps that violate our policies.&#34;\n A version of one of the maps seen by Reuters included the names and addresses of nearly 500 people, many of them students, together with their photos in university or high school uniforms. It had received over 350,000 views.\n The faces of those named had been covered by black squares with the number 112, in reference to the article under the country&#39;s criminal code which makes insulting or defaming the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n  Songklod said that he and the team of volunteers sought to highlight those they accused of breaking that law.\n &#34;When each of us sees something offensive posted on social media, we put it on the map,&#34; he said. Describing it as a &#34;psychological&#34; warfare operation, Songklod said the aim was to dissuade people from online criticism of the monarchy.\n Youth-led protests that began last year brought unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and calls for its reform both on the streets and online.\n The government did not immediately respond to comment on the removal of the Google Maps or the content they contained.\n Songklod, 54, a retired army captain and prominent right-wing activist, said he considered the operation targeting opponents of the monarchy a &#34;massive success&#34; despite the removal of the maps.\n  Human rights groups and critics of the establishment said the maps included the private data and addresses of hundreds of people and could put them at risk of violence.\n &#34;I started to get panicked messages from young people in Thailand who had been doxxed in a royalist document on Google Maps accusing them of being anti-monarchy,&#34; said Andrew MacGregor Marshall, a Scotland-based critic of the monarchy and one of the earliest to highlight the existence of the maps.\n &#34;It\u2019s clear that young Thai people who just want democracy are facing worsening risks.&#34;\n Reporting by Fanny Potkin in Singapore and Panu Wongcha-um in Bangkok, additional reporting by Jessie Pang; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Alison Williams", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u8868\u793a,removed,\u5730\u56fe", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u540d\u6cf0\u56fd\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u548c\u5730\u5740\u88ab\u6307\u8d23\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u541b\u4e3b\u5236 ", "title_en": "Google says it removed two user-generated maps that listed names and addresses of hundreds of Thai activists accused of opposing the monarchy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-takes-down-maps-targeting-hundreds-thais-accused-opposing-king-2021-06-28/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u8868\u793a", "removed", "\u5730\u56fe"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7aa6ffe3cc64f79984b9637328856626.jpg", "infoid": 1068561, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u521b\u5efa\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u540e\u7aef\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5165\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\u7ec4\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u836f\u7269\u548c\u5b89\u6170\u5242\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u90a3\u4e9b\u5e93\u5b58\u4e2d\u7684\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u836f\u7269\u9001\u7ed9\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u8bd5\u7528\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4f1e\uff0c\u6216\u77ed\u6682\u7684RTSM\u3002\n \u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c4G\u4e34\u5e8a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79f0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u957f\u671f\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\n  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5242\u91cf\u4ece\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a6\u5929 -

That means randomizing patients into treatment and placebo groups, locating medicines and placebos, keeping the supply of those medicines stocked, and, at least during the pandemic, delivering those medicines to patients. All of these tasks fall under the umbrella of Randomized Trial Supply Management, or RTSM for short.\n Specifically, 4G Clinical\u2019s software, called Prancer, uses natural language processing to take specific requirements needed to manage a clinical trial, which are often written in long, complex documents, and configures them into a platform.\n  The fastest the company has been able to move from a phone call to the first dose in a clinical trial was 6 days \u2013\u00a0a sprint that created the software needed for a COVID-19 study during the pandemic. That was an exceptionally fast case, but in general, 4G Clinical says it can beat standard timelines by considerable margins.\n \u201cMost vendors in the world would say that they are probably, you know, between 10 and 16 weeks from, you know, from the kicking off a study until they can dose a patient,\u201d says Dave Kelleher, a company co-founder. \u201cOur typical timeline is generally four to six weeks post spec signature.\u201d\n Generally, large pharmaceutical companies are capable of creating these trial management systems internally. Small companies, however, may not have the capability to do so. 4G Clinical goal is to provide a service that can be of use to both. 4G Clinical has currently designed systems for over 230 companies \u2013\u00a0though the company would not disclose the specific trials in which its systems are being used.\n  4G clinical is also announcing over $200 million in a growth equity round led by Goldman Sachs. Before Goldman, the primary investment came from Boston-based Schooner Capital and First Analysis, a VC firm out of Chicago.\n Kelleher declined to say what the plans for the round were, other than company has plans to pursue more go-to-market strategies and R&amp;D, and ultimately aims to \u201ctake up as much air\u201d in the eClinical and RTSM space as possible.\n The eClinical market is expected to reach about   $14.7 billion by 2027 . RTSM made up about 17 percent of market share in 2020. With the complexity of clinical trials increasing, and the number of trials growing \u2013\u00a0even after COVID-19 related issues shut many trials down in 2020 \u2013 there may be room for more growth.\n Before COVID-19, there was evidence that the amount of clinical trials had   steadily been increasing . In 2000, there were 2,119 clinical trials registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. By 2010, 100,208, and by 2020, 362,532 registered by the end of the year (that includes massive slowdowns created by the pandemic for non-COVID research).\n Within that landscape, there is some evidence that sponsors of clinical trials are using more external applications to manage those clinical trials. Of 500 clinical operations professionals respondents   surveyed  by Veeva (another eClinical company, keep in mind) found that 63 percent were using an RTSM system, up from about 43 percent in 2017.\n 4G Clinical, generally, is looking to benefit from the increased public attention to the clinical trials process, and the flexibility that the pandemic has created for sponsors to get creative with clinical trial designs.\n The pandemic did encourage some innovation in this regard. Take, for example, the World Health Organization\u2019s SOLIDARITY trial, which used an adaptive trial design in which multiple drugs could be tested at once. Drugs that showed no promise mid-way through the trial could be dropped (as hydroxychloroquine was in June 2020). The adaptive part, in short, allows for mid-trial tweaks.\n It\u2019s not the traditional design of the gold-standard randomized controlled clinical trial, but it did glean a significant amount of knowledge in a short period of time.   After seven months , three of four drugs tested showed no effect on mortality, whereas the fifth remdesivir, showed some limited promise.\n  Adaptive trial designs weren\u2019t unheard of before the pandemic \u2013\u00a0the FDA had actually released guidance on adaptive clinical trials   in 2019 . But the post-pandemic landscape might encourage more flexibility in this regard, and with it, increase a need for software that can be tweaked to accommodate such changes.\n \u201cI think that we saw some regulatory hurdles reduced as part of this process that allows for more creativity in study design,\u201d says Kelleher. \u201cProbably the most important thing for us is our flexibility, we can make changes to studies very rapidly \u2013\u00a0to live studies.\u201d\n 4G Clinical and other RTSM software like it, are looking to hone tools that already exist within clinical trials \u2013\u00a0specifically software used to actually run them. It\u2019s an area of research that the team itself has both a personal stake in, and strong industry knowledge.\n Kelleher was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 23 (a disease to which there is still no definitive cure), and previously founded the Portland-based ACME business consulting. His co-founder Ed Tourtellotte, lost his wife to breast cancer around the same time. Neither have a background in pharmacology, but rather, the team is tackling drug development through streamlining clinical trial software.\n By contrast, other companies aim to streamline clinical trial processes through A.I-based drug target identification, an especially hype-induced area of the space in which investment quadrupled to   $13.9 billion between 2019 and 2020 . Clinical trial management software may seem more mundane, but it\u2019s still an essential part of running Phase III and most Phase II studies.\n Tourtellotte has designed bespoke software systems for major drug developers, including Pfizer\u2019s Impala system (used in 80 percent of Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials for the past 20 years, says Kelleher) and another system Trident, which was sold   to Bioclinica in 2009 \u00a0(along with Tourtoulette\u2019s company, Tourtellotte Solutions). Trident was   utilized by GlaxoSmithKlein  for clinical trials in 2010.\n At this point, the company has declined to confirm a total amount of funding, but in 2020, revenue grew 110 percent with just ten percent of its portfolio focused on COVID-19 related projects.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:19:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8f6f\u4ef6,goldman,\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c", "title": "4G\u4e34\u5e8a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u7531Goldman Sachs\u63d0\u9ad8200\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "4G Clinical, which develops software to manage clinical trials, raises $200M led by Goldman Sachs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/4g-clinicals-clinical-trial-management-software-attracts-over-200m-in-new-funding/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8f6f\u4ef6", "goldman", "\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c"]}]
