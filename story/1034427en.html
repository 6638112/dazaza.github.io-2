It’s mostly bondage and sadomasochism; generally the dynamic is a high-strung male executive (or highly repressed Orthodox landlord) wanting to let go in a safe and enticing place. Some fantasies are elaborate and bizarre, and my ex wife was a pro at prying out those secrets. Most involved men exploring penetration and homosexuality in a safe, private place. The craziest ones hit the girls. That was double the usual rate.</p><p>在第八大道附近的切尔西地下深处，有一些地牢；主题房间，穿着皮革和乙烯基衣的女人们在这里演绎着客户难以言喻的欲望。这主要是束缚和施虐受虐狂；通常的动力是一个高度紧张的男性高管(或者高度压抑的东正教房东)想要在一个安全和诱人的地方放手。有些幻想既复杂又离奇，而我的前妻是探查这些秘密的行家。大多数涉及男性在一个安全、私密的地方探索渗透和同性恋。最疯狂的袭击了女孩们。这是平时的两倍。</p><p> My ex-wife and I had an arrangement: one of us would work full time to support the other while he or she was in graduate school. She got into Yale’s painting program, and we left New York City together for New Haven.</p><p>我的前妻和我有一个约定：我们中的一个人在他或她读研究生期间会全职工作来养活另一个人。她参加了耶鲁大学的绘画课程，我们一起离开纽约市去了纽黑文。</p><p> After graduation she landed a slot in a prestigious gallery. We moved into an old boiler factory in Queens, which was the only place we could afford with enough space that she could paint. Then Lehman Brothers collapsed, and the New York art market evaporated. Her big debut fell through, the gallery dissolved and we’d run up our credit cards buying supplies with nothing to show for it but a bunch of paintings that were too big to sell.</p><p>毕业后，她在一家有声望的画廊找到了一份工作。我们搬进了皇后区的一家老锅炉厂，这是我们唯一能负担得起的地方，有足够的空间让她画画。然后雷曼兄弟倒闭了，纽约艺术品市场蒸发了。她的盛大首秀失败了，画廊解散了，我们用信用卡购买用品，除了一堆太大而卖不出去的画外，什么都没有展示。</p><p> She’d always had terrible migraines but now when she climbed a ladder or changed positions stars would swirl and her knees would buckle. She was constantly exhausted. The pain changed her.</p><p>她一直有严重的偏头痛，但现在当她爬上梯子或改变姿势时，星星会旋转，她的膝盖会弯曲。她总是疲惫不堪。疼痛改变了她。</p><p> Then came my turn for graduate school. My ex’s old job as a barista was out of the question and she was too sick to accept the only art-related job she could find: managing her mentor’s studio. So I still had to work. There were other complications. She’d cheated on me in New Haven. We officially broke up, but couldn’t afford to move out and the relationship sputtered on.</p><p>然后轮到我读研究生了。我前夫以前的工作是咖啡师，这是不可能的，她病得太重了，无法接受她能找到的唯一一份与艺术相关的工作：管理她导师的工作室。所以我还是得工作。还有其他并发症。她在纽黑文对我不忠。我们正式分手了，但搬不起家，两人的关系继续恶化。</p><p> As things deteriorated she retreated into the basement and fired up her computer. She couldn’t paint anymore, just cruised Craigslist looking for something that would give her enough money to escape. She posted a profile on “SeekingArrangements,” a site where older, busy gentlemen look for convenient ‘arrangements’ with younger, poorer women.</p><p>随着情况的恶化，她退回地下室，启动了电脑。她再也不能画画了，只是在Craigslist上漫游，寻找能让她有足够钱逃走的东西。她在“SeekingArrangements”网站上发布了个人资料，在这个网站上，年纪较大、忙碌的男士们会寻找方便的“安排”，与年轻、贫穷的女性进行交流。</p><p> Sometimes her voice would drift up from the basement and I’d hear her talking to a businessman in Kentucky or an art aficionado in Jersey. She never met any of them.</p><p>有时她的声音会从地下室飘出来，我会听到她和肯塔基州的商人或泽西州的艺术爱好者交谈。她从未见过他们中的任何一个。</p><p> She has a very distinct look. She wore her hair Manic Panic Red and was exceptionally pale. A harsher Tilda Swinton or an Annie Lennox. Eventually she noticed the ads for foot fetish photoshoots and found part-time work as a cashier in a brothel. “Those lazy sluts never shower between visits,” she once told me. The image clung. Eventually she found out about the 8th Avenue dungeons and began working as a dominatrix.</p><p>她的长相非常独特。她留着狂躁恐慌症红色的头发，脸色异常苍白。更严厉的蒂尔达·斯温顿或者安妮·伦诺克斯。最终，她注意到了拍摄恋足癖的广告，并在一家妓院找到了一份兼职收银员的工作。她曾经告诉我：“那些懒惰的荡妇在两次拜访之间从来不洗澡。”这张照片依稀可见。最终，她发现了第8大道的地下城，并开始做一名施虐者。</p><p> I hated it. I was constantly worried, constantly embarrassed, and constantly roiled with jealousy and disgust.</p><p>我讨厌它。我不断地担心，不断地尴尬，不断地被嫉妒和厌恶所困扰。</p><p> The money was good but unsteady and wasn’t that good. An hour was $175 and the house kept a chunk. On a good day she might have three or four clients. Most days she got nothing at all. My ex would anxiously blow the money on a single fancy meal or outfit or addition to her perfume collection. She showered for so long the heat would turn her skin bright red.</p><p>钱是好的，但不稳定，也不是那么好。一小时175美元，房子还留着一大块钱。情况好的时候，她可能会有三四个客户。大多数时候，她什么也得不到。我的前任会焦急地把钱花在一顿漂亮的饭菜或一套衣服上，或者在她的香水收藏上加点钱。她洗了这么长时间的澡，热得她的皮肤会变得鲜红。</p><p> To earn good money as a dominatrix you have to stretch the boundaries of what is legal and entertain constant client contact. Texting, traveling offsite, yacking on the phone: my ex wasn’t willing to do any of it. Besides, she was getting sicker and I was paying most of our bills.</p><p>要想赚到一大笔钱，你必须突破合法的界限，不断地与客户接触。发短信、异地旅行、打电话唠叨：我的前夫不愿意做任何这些事。再说，她的病情越来越重，我们的大部分账单都由我来买单。</p><p> She got too sick for sex work and we married for the insurance. When I lost my job a few weeks later we moved to rural Oklahoma. We divorced soon after. I drove to California. The divorce was amicable. We had nothing to split.</p><p>她病得不能再做性工作了，我们为了保险结婚了。几周后，当我失业时，我们搬到了俄克拉何马州的乡下。不久之后我们就离婚了。我开车去了加州。离婚是友好的。我们没什么可分的。</p><p>  Ten years ago legal sex work in America was gritty and dangerous; today its presence seems almost ubiquitous for young women.</p><p>十年前，合法的性工作在美国是艰难而危险的；如今，它的存在似乎对年轻女性来说几乎无处不在。</p><p> My 21-year-old fiancee told me she signed up for a SeekingArrangements account when she was 18. (We met on Tinder.)</p><p>我21岁的未婚妻告诉我，她在18岁时注册了SeekingArrangements账户。(我们是在Tinder上认识的。)。</p><p> The idea was to get enough money to elope with her then-girlfriend. She made an account,  chatted with weird old guys for a few days and never did anything with it, but a few of her friends did.  One was a sugar baby to a series of men who’d buy him Balenciaga  and ounces of cocaine. A couple of others cam for beer money.</p><p>这个想法是为了弄到足够的钱和她当时的女朋友私奔。她注册了一个账户，和古怪的老头聊了几天，从来没有用过它，但她的几个朋友做了。其中一个是一群男人的甜蜜宝贝，他们会给他买巴黎世家1美元和几盎司的可卡因。还有几个人想要啤酒钱。</p><p> How could sex work be taken so casually? The thought of any sex work disturbed me; imagining that upper-middle class teenagers were willingly dipping their toes into a dark and dangerous place seemed unfathomable. Surely they weren’t making it out unscathed.</p><p>性工作怎么能这么随便呢？任何性工作的想法都让我感到不安；想象中上阶层的青少年心甘情愿地涉足黑暗和危险的地方似乎是难以理解的。当然，他们并不是毫发无损地逃了出来。</p><p> My fiancee was born in 1999 and grew up online. She’s always had her own cell phone (I didn’t get one until I was 25) and maintained several identities in public and private. She grew up fending off predatory male attention. I’ve seen it happen: a G-rated holiday snap will yield a dozen disgusting offers from strangers.</p><p>我的未婚妻出生于1999年，在网络上长大。她一直都有自己的手机(我直到25岁才有一部)，在公共场合和私人场合都保持着几个身份。她从小就抵挡男性掠夺性的关注。我见过这样的事情：一张G级的假日照片会收到十几个来自陌生人的令人作呕的邀请。</p><p> She’s a Bernie supporter but tells me she isn’t completely comfortable with third wave feminism—she doesn’t like the idea that feminine sexuality has been completely commodified, that now as a young woman it’s okay to be approached and solicited for nudes by complete strangers. Heaving sexuality is ubiquitous right now. Not so much through porn-- although porn is available to anyone, anywhere instantaneously-- so much as the sheer volume of beautiful faces and bodies. By any standard my fiancee is a beautiful woman but she constantly worries that her jawline could be sharper and her tummy tighter and which surgeries might be able to correct them. And of course the social media goliaths’ ad servers make sure to deliver a constant flow of “solutions”.</p><p>她是伯尼的支持者，但她告诉我，她对第三波女权主义并不完全满意-她不喜欢女性的性已经完全商品化的想法，现在作为一个年轻女性，被完全陌生的人接近并乞求裸体是可以接受的。眼下，性欲高涨的现象无处不在。与其说是通过色情，不如说是通过色情--尽管任何人、任何地方都可以即时获得色情--更多的是美丽的面孔和身体的数量。无论以什么标准来衡量，我的未婚妻都是一位美丽的女人，但她总是担心自己的下巴轮廓可能会更尖，肚子会更紧，以及哪些手术可能会纠正这些问题。当然，社交媒体巨头的广告服务器也会确保提供源源不断的“解决方案”。</p><p> I wanted to see how things had changed, so I asked my fiancee to connect me with people who were using OnlyFans, an “ethical porn provider.”</p><p>我想看看情况发生了什么变化，所以我让未婚妻帮我联系了使用OnlyFans的人，OnlyFans是一家“道德色情提供商”。</p><p>  I read an online guide to camming created by Aella_Girl, a frequent Twitter presence among San Francisco’s edgier digital communities. She’s a top ranked OnlyFans performer, a former cam girl who claims to have earned $50,000 in a single month camming, and likely earns near it as an OnlyFans performer.</p><p>我读到了Aella_Girl制作的在线卡通指南，Aella_Girl在旧金山比较前卫的数字社区中经常出现在Twitter上。她是一名排名靠前的OnlyFans表演者，曾经是一名摄像机女孩，声称一个月的演艺收入为5万美元，很可能作为OnlyFans表演者赚得接近这个数字。</p><p> Her guide ( Maximizing Your Slut Impact: An Overly Analytic Guide to Camgirling) reads like an onboarding document from a friendly San Francisco startup. She lays out how to “do sex work” and somehow there isn’t a fragment of pathos attached. That doesn’t mean she’s cruel. She treats her customers gently and gives other girls humane advice for dealing with them (and whipping them up into donation frenzies).</p><p>她的指南(最大化你的荡妇影响力：坎姆吉林过度分析指南)读起来像是一份来自旧金山一家友好初创公司的入职文件。她列出了如何“做性工作”，但不知何故却没有丝毫感伤。这并不意味着她很残忍。她温柔地对待她的顾客，并给其他女孩提供人道的建议来处理他们(并激起她们的捐赠狂潮)。</p><p> It’s as if the thirty years or so of cultural warfare between the Christian right and free speech left in the United States never happened. Elsewhere (and written a few years later) Aella talks about her religious upbringing. I suspect the stance she took writing the guide was deliberate, but still, seeing sex work discussed so openly was surreal.</p><p>这就好像基督教右翼和留在美国的言论自由之间长达30年左右的文化战争从未发生过。在其他地方(几年后写的)，艾拉谈到了她的宗教成长经历。我怀疑她在撰写指南时采取的立场是故意的，但尽管如此，看到如此公开地讨论性工作还是超现实的。</p><p> I think Aella has perfected her “voice:” throughout all of her [SFW] content, her personality seems to blaze through. I was not at all surprised to discover she created what was once the most popular post ever in an online Reddit community devoted to amateur pornography: “Getting Gnaked Gonline” She comes off as a sweet and sincere girl-next-door who’s at the computer, slowly revealing herself to the world. The perfect Redditor girlfriend, interested in the same subreddits as her viewers (including the naughty ones). Her sense of theatre is sublime.</p><p>我认为艾拉已经完善了她的“声音”：在她所有的内容中，她的个性似乎闪耀着光芒。当我发现她在Reddit上发布了一个曾经是业余色情网站社区里最受欢迎的帖子时，我一点也不感到惊讶：“让裸体上线”她表现得像一个甜蜜真诚的隔壁女孩，坐在电脑前，慢慢地向世界展示着她自己的面貌。完美的Rededitor女友，和她的观众(包括淘气的观众)对同样的次要内容感兴趣。她的戏剧感高超。</p><p> Aella’s guidebook recommends against using too much lighting. The last thing you want to do is mimic the disturbing cubicle-like battery porn farms set up in garages and warehouses in seedy places like Romania or Los Angeles. She suggests a single larger soft light source. (Which is flattering but far less ‘professional’ or revealing as a three-light setup) A bit of dust in the corners; the low production values create an authentic experience, until it’s almost like having a real long distance relationship.</p><p>艾拉的旅游指南建议不要使用过多的灯光。你最不想做的事就是模仿在罗马尼亚或洛杉矶等破旧地方的车库和仓库里设立的令人不安的隔间式的电池色情农场。她建议使用一个更大的柔和光源。(这让人觉得受宠若惊，但在三盏灯的设置下就不那么“专业”或暴露了)角落里有一点灰尘；较低的制作价值创造了一种真实的体验，直到它几乎就像是一段真正的异地恋。</p><p> The suggestion of her happiness seems key. Most people want to share their intimacy. The great illusion in BDSM was that the dominatrix was in control and enjoying the experience (when of course she was the one getting paid by the client). I’m sure it’s no different with camming.</p><p>暗示她的幸福似乎是关键。大多数人都想分享他们的亲密关系。BDSM中最大的错觉是，施虐者控制着并享受着这种体验(当然，她是客户付钱的那个人)。我敢肯定这和卡门没什么不同。</p><p> She doesn’t cam anymore. Aella “lives on OnlyFans now, like the rest of the world.”</p><p>她再也不会投篮了。艾拉“现在只靠风扇生活，就像世界上其他地方一样。”</p><p> I tried reaching out on Twitter, and found myself talking with one of her real friends, another OnlyFans creator, a French woman living in Berlin named Alice Callipyge (  @acallipyge). I asked her what it was like.</p><p>我试着在Twitter上联系，发现自己在和她的一个真正的朋友聊天，她是OnlyFans的另一位创建者，一个住在柏林的法国女人，名叫Alice Callipyge(@acallipyge)。我问她那是什么感觉。</p><p>  “I think of it as feeding my pets,” @adorable_alice tells me, referring to the multiple platforms she inhabits.</p><p>“我认为这是在给我的宠物喂奶，”@ADOBLE_爱丽丝告诉我，她指的是她所居住的多个平台。</p><p> Alice spends much of her digital existence tending communities of admirers on Reddit and Twitter, seeding them with videos and clips, hoping to lure them to her OnlyFans page, and then spark enough of a connection to snag a subscriber or two.</p><p>爱丽丝在数字生活中的大部分时间都在Reddit和Twitter上照顾崇拜者社区，向他们播送视频和视频片段，希望把他们引诱到她的OnlyFans页面，然后产生足够的联系来吸引一两个订阅者。</p><p> “My persona on each is a little different,” she says. “Reddit likes girls who aren’t self-aware, who aren’t taking their clothes off for a profit. So on there, Alice is more naive, I say things I never would in real life, like ‘I’m not the youngest one here…  can a 28-year-old still be sexy?’”</p><p>她说：“我在每一件衣服上的个性都有些不同。”“Reddit喜欢没有自我意识的女孩，她们不会为了盈利而脱掉衣服。”所以在那里，爱丽丝更天真，我说了一些我在现实生活中永远不会说的话，比如‘我不是这里最小的一个，…。28岁的人怎么还能性感呢？“。</p><p> Her friends mostly accepted her new job, with the exception of her best friend in France who can’t seem to understand why her witty, philosophical best friend would act so shallow on Twitter.</p><p>她的朋友们大多接受了她的新工作，除了她在法国最好的朋友，她似乎不明白为什么她这位机智、有哲理的最好朋友会在推特上表现得如此肤浅。</p><p> It’s a strategy that’s worked well for her. She joined the platform in March, a few days after the City of Berlin locked down during the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of her first month she was netting nearly a thousand Euros and ranked in the top ten percent of OnlyFans’ 450,000+ subscribers.</p><p>这是一个对她很有效的策略。她是在3月份加入这个平台的，几天前，柏林市在新冠肺炎疫情期间被封锁。到第一个月底，她净赚了近1000欧元，在OnlyFans的45万+订户中排名前10%。</p><p> Six months later she’s even closer to the summit: at last look she was in the top 0.43 percent of performers, earning a comfortable living after OnlyFans’ 20 percent take and Germany’s aggressive personal income taxes. She estimates she’s grossing around 7,000-8,000 Euros a month.</p><p>六个月后，她离巅峰更近了一步：最后看起来，她是表现最好的0.43%的人之一，在OnlyFans收取20%的税和德国积极的个人所得税之后，她过着舒适的生活。据她估计，她的月薪约为7000-8000欧元。</p><p> Percentile is determined by her previous 30 days earnings. It’s the first thing Alice says she checks in the morning, and at times feels like a videogame.</p><p>百分位数是由她之前30天的收入决定的。爱丽丝说，这是她早上检查的第一件事，有时感觉就像是在玩电子游戏。</p><p> “The closer you are to the top,’ Alice says, “the more decimals they add and the further away it slides.”</p><p>“你离顶端越近，”爱丽丝说，“他们加的小数越多，它就滑得越远。”</p><p> Performers at the pinnacle of OnlyFans—generally celebrities like Cardi B or established porn actresses—earn millions. Just below them, performers like Paige Bauer, ranked 0.06%, claim earnings exceeding $100,000 a month.</p><p>在OnlyFans顶峰的表演者-通常是像Cardi B这样的名人或老牌色情女演员-赚取数百万美元。紧随其后的是排名0.06%的佩吉·鲍尔(Paige Bauer)，他们声称每月收入超过10万美元。</p><p>  My assumption going into this assignment was that OnlyFans would be an inhumane experience for everyone involved.</p><p>在开始这项任务时，我的假设是，对于每个参与其中的人来说，只有风扇才是一种不人道的体验。</p><p> My ex hated being at the beck and call of her clients. Financial domination meant enduring middle-aged whimpering for hours a day. People were shameless. In the brothel they’d often try to use fake currency, knowing the girls could never complain. Sugar babies I’ve spoken to tell me credit card charge backs are frequent and rarely disputed. Every single sex worker I’ve ever known has a had a close call with violent client (or angry partner).</p><p>我的前夫讨厌听命于她的客户。金融统治意味着中年人每天忍受数小时的哭泣。人们是无耻的。在妓院里，她们经常试图使用假币，因为她们知道女孩们永远不会抱怨。和我聊过的甜心宝贝们告诉我，信用卡退款是经常发生的，也很少引起争议。我所认识的每一个性工作者都曾与暴力客户(或愤怒的伴侣)有过一次亲密接触。</p><p> I imagined OnlyFans as a potential FAANG sibling, a sinister algorithmic pimp; an artificial intelligence trained on a dataset of digital desire, nudging subscribers and performers toward ever more lewd and expensive acts of depravity.</p><p>我把OnlyFans想象成一个潜在的FAANG兄弟，一个邪恶的算法皮条客；一种人工智能，基于数字欲望的数据集，将订阅者和表演者推向更加淫秽和代价高昂的堕落行为。</p><p> I asked Alice whether she’d noticed a shadowy artificial intelligence scheming behind the scenes.</p><p>我问爱丽丝，她是否注意到了幕后隐秘的人工智能阴谋。</p><p> “There is no artificial intelligence nor gamification that I can see beyond the percentage,” Alice told me. “Honestly I wish there were more tech, it’s often broken. For a while people were able to open pay per view messages without paying and the livestream is often out. It’s just us, helping one another.”</p><p>爱丽丝告诉我：“除了这个百分比，我看不到任何人工智能或游戏化。”“老实说，我希望有更多的科技产品，它经常坏掉。”有一段时间，人们不用付费就可以打开按次付费的消息，直播经常会被淘汰。只有我们，互相帮助。“。</p><p> The percentile is nefarious, I suppose. It’s basically a dark pattern (a manipulative bit of web programming) that pits the girls against one another and punishes them when they take a break from the platform. When they slip in the rankings it becomes harder to make money. It encourages them to engage and to be online, constantly.</p><p>我想，百分位数是邪恶的。这基本上是一种黑暗的模式(一种操纵性的网络编程)，让女孩们相互竞争，并在她们离开平台时惩罚她们。当他们的排名下滑时，赚钱就变得更难了。它鼓励他们不断地参与并在线。</p><p> OnlyFans is a paywalled MySpace. It’s an uncensored, digital third place where a performer like Alice can share pictures and video clips and live video feeds and charge fans for pieces of ‘custom’ correspondence.</p><p>OnlyFans是一个付费的MySpace。这是一个未经审查的数字第三站，像爱丽丝这样的表演者可以在这里分享照片、视频片段和直播视频，并向粉丝收取“定制”信件的费用。</p><p> It fits this strange cultural moment of eternal house arrest; it’s a medium for the lonely, tailor-made for our quarantined, screen-fed culture.</p><p>它适合这个被永久软禁的奇怪文化时刻；它是为我们与世隔绝的、屏幕喂养的文化量身定做的孤独的媒介。</p><p> There’s no moderation. It’s easy to sign up and intuitive to use. It’s a bit like Shopify or Etsy; only instead of nourishing cottage industries and craftwork, OnlyFans is the destination for  home-brew pornography, and doubly so since the pandemic struck, and people are stuck behind screens, starved for novelty and contact.</p><p>没有节制。它很容易注册，使用起来也很直观。这有点像Shopify或Etsy；只不过，OnlyFans不是滋养家庭手工业和手工艺，而是家庭酿造色情作品的目的地，自从疫情爆发以来，情况更加如此，人们被困在屏幕后面，渴望新奇和接触。</p><p> The images and video and livestreams, I’m told, are more personal than the professionally produced material available on Pornhub (much of which has been scraped—bulk copied by algorithm—from defunct sites). OnlyFans content feels personal and intimate by comparison; it’s porn without the glare of a San Fernando Valley studio lighting and millions of digital smudges, the closest you’ll ever get to a fresh nude sent during the first flush of digital courtship.</p><p>我被告知，这些图片、视频和直播比PornHub上提供的专业制作的素材更个人化(其中大部分是从不存在的网站上拼凑而成的，由算法批量复制)。相比之下，只有粉丝的内容让人感觉个人化和私密化；它是色情，没有圣费尔南多山谷摄影棚的耀眼灯光和数百万的数字污点，这是你在第一次数字求爱中发送的最接近新鲜裸体的东西。</p><p> My fiancee introduced me to one of her friends who had just joined the platform.</p><p>我的未婚妻把我介绍给她的一个朋友，她刚加入这个平台。</p><p>  myramona began her OnlyFans experience a month ago. She announced her decision to a close circle of trusted friends on her “finsta” (a fake instagram, i.e. her anonymous instagram account). She comes across as a typical college student on Zoom. Like Alice, she’s a skilled and generous conversationalist.</p><p>Myramona一个月前开始了她的OnlyFans体验。她在她的“finsta”(一个假的Instagram，即她的匿名Instagram账户)上向一群值得信赖的朋友宣布了她的决定。在Zoom上，她给人的印象是一个典型的大学生。和爱丽丝一样，她也是一位技术娴熟、慷慨大方的健谈者。</p><p> Isn’t it weird having your friends subscribe to your account, my fiancee asked her.</p><p>我的未婚妻问她：让你的朋友订阅你的账户不是很奇怪吗？</p><p> “Actually only one of my friends signed up as a subscriber,” says Ramona, “but in a way he doesn’t count because we hooked up once and we used to talk about how I wanted to become a sex worker some day.”</p><p>“实际上，我只有一个朋友注册了订户，”雷蒙娜说，“但在某种程度上，他算不上什么，因为我们曾经勾搭过一次，我们曾经谈论过我有一天是多么想成为一名性工作者。”</p><p> She said her significant other didn’t mind her joining OnlyFans. They do discuss how he might feel if other friends subscribed.</p><p>她说她的另一半不介意她加入OnlyFans。他们确实讨论了如果其他朋友订阅，他会有什么感受。</p><p> So far she’s been successful. During her first week she found herself ranked in the 70s after a couple of successful Twitter posts and building a Reddit presence. By the end of her first month she was in the 14th percentile. At last count with 74 subscribers she was in the 11th percentile, with about a thousand dollars earned in the previous thirty days. The money is potentially life-changing. Offline she’s a university student working two other jobs. OnlyFans is already earning her as much as the other two combined.</p><p>到目前为止，她已经取得了成功。在她上任的第一周，她发现自己在推特上发了几条成功的帖子，并在Reddit上建立了自己的影响力，排名在70年代。在她出生的第一个月末，她已经排到了第14个百分位数。根据最新统计，她拥有74名订户，排在第11位，在之前的30天里赚了大约1000美元。这笔钱可能会改变人们的生活。在线下，她是一名大学生，还做着另外两份工作。OnlyFans已经让她赚到了其他两家公司的总和。</p><p>  “Actually the reason I joined was that I was approached on Instagram. He asked if he could pay for my nudes. We negotiated and he paid me for ten. I thought... why not?”</p><p>“实际上，我加入的原因是Instagram上有人来找我。”他问我能不能付我裸体的钱。我们协商好了，他付了我10英镑。我以为..。有何不可？“。</p><p> Sex work without a pimp seems like a victimless crime. Crossing the threshold between civilian and sex worker has never been so effortless.</p><p>没有皮条客的性工作似乎是一种没有受害者的犯罪。跨越平民和性工作者之间的门槛从来没有像现在这样毫不费力。</p><p>  Not everyone finds her pets the same way. There are some strikingly unconventional strategies to lure subscribers.</p><p>并不是每个人都以同样的方式找到她的宠物。有一些引人注目的非常规策略来吸引订户。</p><p> Sofie Halili (@literallysofie on Twitter) and Aella (@Aella_Girl) have amassed large followings by taunting and challenging their audiences (the former with anti-chauvinist visual memes and the latter with a combination of intriguing polling information and , enthusiasm for psychedelic drugs). The information is paired with intriguing pictures and easy-to-find links to more. Like Ramona and Alice, they provide intimacy at scale.</p><p>Sofie Halili(推特上的@文字ysofie)和Aella(@Aella_Girl)通过嘲弄和挑战他们的观众(前者使用反沙文主义的视觉表情包，后者使用耐人寻味的民调信息和对迷幻药物的热情)，积累了大量追随者(前者使用反沙文主义的视觉表情包，后者使用耐人寻味的民调信息和对迷幻药物的热情)。这些信息配有引人入胜的图片和更多信息的容易找到的链接。就像雷蒙娜和爱丽丝一样，他们提供大规模的亲密关系。</p><p> As a subscriber you can engage at the level you want; it’s like investing in a relationship, only instead of spending your time and attention as a partner, you’re paying a monthly fee. The lines do blur. Real friendships between subscribers and performers can form. It’s more than sex appeal they’re selling on OnlyFans, it’s authenticity—the same thing that independent coffeeshops have been taking advantage of for years. By letting employees hang artwork and choose the music they attach themselves to youth culture for free. At least OnlyFans lets them take a cut.</p><p>作为订阅者，你可以随心所欲地参与；这就像是投资于一段关系，只不过你不是把时间和注意力花在合作伙伴身上，而是每月支付费用。界限确实很模糊。订阅者和表演者之间可以建立真正的友谊。他们在Fans上销售的不仅仅是性感，还有真实性--这也是独立咖啡馆多年来一直在利用的东西。通过允许员工悬挂艺术品和选择音乐，他们免费将自己依附在年轻人的文化中。至少只有球迷会让他们分一杯羹。</p><p>  To exist as a young woman online without the privacy settings on ‘max’ means enduring a firehose of attention. Given that attention is one of the fundamental currencies of the internet, the ability to snare it is clearly valuable.</p><p>在没有“max”隐私设置的情况下，以年轻女性的身份上网意味着要忍受大量的关注。鉴于注意力是互联网的基本货币之一，吸引注意力的能力显然是有价值的。</p><p> “I think of it like tattoos,” Ramona says. “Society is changing really fast. A generation ago—your generation—women couldn’t have visible tattoos or if they did they’d have to hide them at work. But now they’re ubiquitous. I feel like with the way culture is heading it won’t be a big deal to have sold your nudes online. And the quarantine is just making everything go faster.”</p><p>“我觉得这就像纹身，”雷蒙娜说。他说：“社会的变化真的很快。上一代--你们这一代人--女性不可能有看得见的纹身，如果有，她们不得不在工作时把纹身藏起来。但现在它们无处不在。我觉得按照文化的发展方向，在网上卖你的裸体照片没什么大不了的。而隔离只会让一切变得更快。“。</p><p> To many young women, the relentless hunger for attention is exhausting. Ramona says it felt gratifying. “I’ve had body issues my entire life,” she said. “Now people are willing to pay to see me.”</p><p>对许多年轻女性来说，对关注的无休止渴望是令人精疲力竭的。雷蒙娜说，这让人感到欣慰。“我一生都有身体问题，”她说。“现在人们都愿意花钱来看我了。”</p><p>  “I value my time more than I did,” Ramona says. “Working customer service teaches you how to deal with people but oh my God this is another level. People are generally pretty respectful but if they aren’t l block them outright. Same goes for my personal life.”</p><p>“我比以前更珍惜我的时间，”雷蒙娜说。“有工作的客服教你如何与人打交道，但天哪，这是另一个层次。”人们通常都很尊重别人，但如果他们不尊重别人，就会直接把他们挡在门外。我的个人生活也是如此。“。</p><p>  “I tried! It’s too exhausting to play a character,” Ramona says. “It’s so much easier for it to be you. I tried—in the beginning I was trying to figure out what people would like about me, I’m a college girl, I’m half-Asian, and I kept trying those niches but what stuck was completely random.”</p><p>“我试过了！演一个角色太累人了，“雷蒙娜说。“对你来说，这件事要容易得多。我试过了--一开始我想弄清楚人们会喜欢我什么，我是一名大学女生，我有一半亚洲血统，我一直在尝试这些利基市场，但我坚持的完全是随机的。“。</p><p> She experimented with photography techniques and lighting but found that the most effective posts were those that simply looked like what she might have sent a potential suitor. “What works is me,” she says.</p><p>她对摄影技巧和灯光进行了试验，但发现最有效的帖子就是那些看起来就像她可能给潜在追求者发的帖子。“起作用的是我，”她说。</p><p> After all, ‘me’ is a character she’s been perfecting for years on various social media platforms. OnlyFans can be gross but it beats the hell out of serving pizza.</p><p>毕竟，“我”是她多年来在各种社交媒体平台上不断完善的角色。只有扇子才能让人恶心，但提供披萨已经是天方夜谭了。</p><p> Alice says she doesn’t play a character either. “I have a niche,” she says. “I think of myself as a natural girl -- I don’t wear so much makeup, I’m athletic and I enjoy nature but it isn’t so much a character.” In her online biography she says she has a vulnerability kink. She shares remarkably personal information with her followers, and although she’s usually positive and upbeat in her social media posts, she doesn’t care to hide when she’s exhausted or upset. It’s her life only amplified and exaggerated. Social media is unique in that it provides the illusion of an equal exchange between an account with 10,000s of followers and an account with only a few.</p><p>爱丽丝说她也不演角色。“我有一个利基市场，”她说。“我认为自己是一个天生的女孩--我不化那么多妆，我喜欢运动，我喜欢大自然，但这并不是一个性格。”在她的网络传记中，她说自己有一种脆弱的怪癖。她与粉丝分享非常私人的信息，尽管她在社交媒体上的帖子通常是积极乐观的，但当她筋疲力尽或心烦意乱时，她并不介意隐藏起来。这是她的生活，只是被放大和夸张了。社交媒体的独特之处在于，它提供了一种在拥有1万粉丝的账户和只有几个粉丝的账户之间平等交流的错觉。</p><p> Alice makes sure she doesn’t let her entire life become digitized. She takes a few days off here and there and focuses entirely on her partner. But most of her day is at least partially consumed with the experience of maintaining hundreds of micro-relationships and feeding her pets.</p><p>爱丽丝确保她不会让自己的整个生活变得数字化。她时不时地休息几天，全神贯注于她的伴侣。但她一天中的大部分时间至少有部分时间被维持数百个微关系和喂养她的宠物的经历所消耗。</p><p> One of those pets is an important backchannel: a Telegram group of fellow “natural” girls she communicates and cooperates with.</p><p>其中一只宠物是一个重要的秘密渠道：与她交流和合作的一群“天生”的女孩组成的电报小组。</p><p> “I earned about a thousand Euros at the end of my first month,” Alice says. “I barely managed to break into the top tenth; after I started getting some attention I made about 3,000 my second month and then during the summer I got a bit stuck. It wasn’t until I joined a couple of Telegraph groups that I broke through, that gave me a huge boost.”</p><p>爱丽丝说：“在我第一个月的月底，我赚了大约1000欧元。”“我勉强挤进了前十名；在我开始受到一些关注后，我第二个月赚了大约3000英镑，然后在夏天我就有点卡住了。”直到我加入了几个电报群，我才突围而出，这给了我很大的鼓舞。“。</p><p> It took her about four months of effort to earn more than she could have been making teaching foreign languages with her Masters degree. “The first few months were really hard because I didn’t understand how to get subscribers.” Gradually she learned how to salt pictures and videos of herself in larger communities like Reddit and Twitter, and to leave URLs for her fans to find.</p><p>她花了大约四个月的时间才赚到了比她用硕士学位教外语所能赚到的还要多的钱。“最初的几个月真的很艰难，因为我不知道如何获得订户。”渐渐地，她学会了如何在Reddit和Twitter等更大的社区中添加自己的照片和视频，并留下URL供粉丝查找。</p><p> She worries a bit about the illusion of easy money on the site. “If the top ten percent is only earning a thousand Euros a month and I was putting in hours and hours every day, it makes you realize how little most people are making on the site.”</p><p>她有点担心网站上容易赚钱的错觉。“如果前10%的人每月只赚1000欧元，而我每天都花上好几个小时，这会让你意识到大多数人在这个网站上赚的钱是多么少。”</p><p> One recent estimate suggests a 50th percentile OnlyFans performer takes home a mere $43 a month. Many of the bottom half are casual users, but it seems like few of them are spending a lot of time to earn very little. ( ReadySetCam surveyed camgirls and found a more generous hourly wage.)</p><p>最近的一项估计表明，只有50%的球迷表演者每月的收入只有43美元。下半部的许多人都是临时用户，但他们中似乎没有几个人花了很多时间赚很少的钱。(ReadySetCam对女服务员进行了调查，发现她们的时薪更高。)。</p><p> Ramona carefully weighed whet</p><p>雷蒙娜仔细权衡了一下</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://jamesmcgirk.substack.com/p/sirens-in-the-digital-ocean">https://jamesmcgirk.substack.com/p/sirens-in-the-digital-ocean</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/规模/">#规模</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/intimacy/">#intimacy</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
