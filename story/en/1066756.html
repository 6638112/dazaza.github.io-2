She was 86.</p><p>珍妮特Malcolm是纽约人的长期作家，他以她的刺穿判断而闻名，她的小说类似的非小说和挑衅性的道德确定性，即在新闻和从业人员中施放了寒冷的新闻，周三在曼哈顿的一家医院去世。她是86岁。</p><p>   Over a 55-year career, Ms. Malcolm produced an avalanche of deeply reported, exquisitely crafted articles, essays and books, most devoted to her special interests in literature, biography, photography, psychoanalysis and true crime. Her writing was precise and analytical; her unflinching gaze missed nothing.</p><p>   在55年的职业生涯中，Malcolm女士在深深报告的雪崩中产生了雪崩，精湛的制作文章，散文和书籍，最致力于她在文学，传记，摄影，精神分析和真正犯罪中的特殊兴趣。她的写作是精确和分析的;她的悬而未决的凝视错过了。</p><p> “Don’t ever eat in front of Janet Malcolm; or show her your apartment; or cut tomatoes while she watches,” the  critic Robert S. Boynton warned in 1992. “In fact, it probably isn’t a good idea even to grant her an interview, as your every unflattering gesture and nervous tic will be recorded eventually with devastating precision.”</p><p> “不要在珍妮特马尔科姆前吃饭;或者告诉她你的公寓;或者在她看的时候剪了西红柿，“罗伯特S. Boynton于1992年警告说道。”事实上，即使给她接受采访也许不是一个好主意，因为你的每一个未被考虑的手势和紧张的TIC都会最终记录毁灭性的精确度。“</p><p> She herself was a cautious interviewee. When The New York Times Book Review in 2019 asked Ms. Malcolm, a voracious reader,  what was on her night stand, she replied: “My actual night stand is a small wood table with a box of Kleenex, a two-year-old Garnet Hill catalog and a cough drop on it.”</p><p> 她自己是一个谨慎的受访者。当纽约时报在2019年审查时问Malcolm女士，一个贪婪的读者，她的夜间站在夜晚，她回答说：“我的实际夜晚是一个小木桌子，一盒Kleenex，一个两岁石榴石山目录和咳嗽掉落。“</p><p> Whatever Ms. Malcolm was writing about, her real subject was often the writing process itself — the slipperiness of truth, the perils of the writer-subject relationship, the ethical choices that writers are constantly called to make. One of the through lines in her work was a merciless view of journalism, never mind that she was one of its most prominent practitioners.</p><p> 无论Malcolm女士写作，她真正的主题往往是写作过程本身 - 事实的光滑，作者的危险 - 主题关系，作家不断地调查的道德选择。她工作中的一条通行证之一是一个无情的新闻，别介意她是最突出的从业者之一。</p><p> “Human frailty continues to be the currency in which it trades,” she wrote in “Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial” (2011). “Malice remains its animating impulse.”</p><p> “人类的脆弱仍然是IT交易的货币，”她在“森林山的Iphigenia”中写道：谋杀审判的解剖学“（2011年）。 “恶意仍然是它的动画冲动。”</p><p> Her most famous work was “The Journalist and the Murderer,” published as a two-part essay in The New Yorker in 1989 and as a book the next year. A forensic examination of the relationship between  Joe McGinniss, a best-selling author, and Jeffrey MacDonald, a doctor who was convicted of murdering his family, it castigated Mr. McGinniss for pretending to believe in Dr. MacDonald’s innocence long after he was convinced of his guilt. Ms. Malcolm focused less on the murder — a story told many times over in articles, books, TV movies and podcasts — than on a lawsuit that Dr. MacDonald had brought against Mr. McGinniss, saying that he had deceived him.</p><p> 她最着名的工作是“记者和凶手”，于1989年作为纽约人的两篇文章发布，是明年的一本书。对Joe McGinniss，一位畅销作者和杰弗里麦克唐纳之间的关系的法医审查，被判谋杀他的家庭的博士，而是假装McGinnis先生假装在他相信之后相信麦克唐纳博士的纯真他的内疚。 Malcolm女士重点关注谋杀案 - 一个故事在文章，书籍，电视电影和播客中讲述了多次，而不是麦克唐纳博士遭到麦金根先生的诉讼，称他欺骗了他。 </p><p> Her essay began with one of the most arresting first sentences in literary nonfiction: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.”</p><p>她的论文始于文学非小说中最逮捕的第一句：“每个并不是太愚蠢或太充满了自己的记者，以注意到发生的事情，所以他所做的事情是道德上的。</p><p> Her pronouncement enraged the journalistic firmament. Many writers insisted that this was not how they treated their subjects and accused Ms. Malcolm of tarring everyone with the same broad brush.</p><p> 她的声明激起了新闻穹苍。许多作家坚持认为，这不是他们对他们的主题的方式，并指责Malcolm女士率先用同样的广泛刷子判断每个人。</p><p>  But what galled some journalists about the piece the most,  The Times reported in 1989, “was her failure, and that of her magazine, to disclose that Miss Malcolm had been accused of the same kind of behavior, in a lawsuit filed against her by the subject of an earlier New Yorker article.”</p><p>  但是，有些记者有关这一作品的困境，现在是1989年的时代报告，“她的失败，以及她的杂志，披露马尔科姆小姐被指控的行为，在诉诸于她的诉讼中被指控早期的纽约人文的主题。“</p><p> That earlier article, a 1983 profile of the flamboyant psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson, led to a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm that hung over her during a decade of litigation and clouded her reputation even longer.</p><p> 早期的文章是1983年的Flamboyant Psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson的简介，导致了一个对阵Malcolm女士的诽谤诉讼，在十年诉讼中悬挂在她身上，并使她的声誉蒙上蒙上阴影。</p><p> The legal allegations were different: The MacDonald suit accused Mr. McGinniss of fraud and breach of contract; the Masson suit accused Ms. Malcolm of libel. But both suits raised serious questions about journalistic ethics — Dr. MacDonald’s about the nature of writers’ obligations to their sources, and Mr. Masson’s about what constitutes quotations and what license, if any, reporters may take with them.</p><p> 法律指控是不同的：麦克唐纳诉讼指责麦金先生欺诈和违约; Masson诉讼被告诽谤Malcolm女士。但两套诉讼都提出了关于新闻道德的严重问题 - 麦克唐纳博士关于作家对其来源的义务的性质，以及马龙先生的关于什么构成引文以及哪些许可证，如果有的话，记者可以随身携带。</p><p> The journalistic community generally judged Ms. Malcolm harshly, mostly for the finding in the Masson case that she had cobbled together 50 or 60 separate conversations with the loquacious Mr. Masson and made them appear as if he had spoken them in a single lunchtime monologue.</p><p> 新闻社区普遍判断Malcolm女士严厉，主要是为了在Masson案例中找到她们在一起50或60个单独的谈话与马龙潜人的分开对话，并使它们看起来好像他在单一的午餐时讲述了它们。</p><p> “This thing called speech is sloppy, redundant, repetitious, full of uhs and ahs,” Ms. Malcolm  testified in her defense in 1993 during the first of two jury trials. “I needed to present it in logical, rational order so he would sound like a logical, rational person.”</p><p> “这件事叫做言论是邋，冗余的，重复，满满的uhs和ahs，”马尔科姆女士于1993年在两项陪审团试验中在1993年的防守中作证。 “我需要以逻辑，合理的顺序呈现它，以便他听起来像一个逻辑，理性的人。” </p><p> Among her critics was Anna Quindlen, then a Times columnist, who wrote that Ms. Malcolm’s technique was “beyond the pale.”</p><p>在她的批评者中是安娜Quindlen，然后是一个次的专栏作家，他们写道，马尔科姆女士的技术是“超越苍白”。</p><p> “This thing called life is sloppy,”  Ms. Quindlen wrote, “and slice-of-life is what a reporter is meant to reflect, not some tidier or more dramatic composite version.”</p><p> “这件事叫做生命是邋，”Quindlen女士写道，“和生命的切片是记者旨在反映的，而不是一些超天化或更多戏剧性的复合版本。”</p><p>  The MacDonald case ended in a hung jury; to avoid a second trial, Mr. McGinniss settled with Dr. MacDonald for $325,000. (Dr. MacDonald is  serving three life sentences.) In the Masson suit,  the jury ruled that while two of five disputed quotations that Ms. Malcolm had attributed to Mr. Masson were false and that one of those was defamatory, none were written with reckless disregard of the truth, the standard under which libel damages would have been allowed.</p><p>  麦克唐纳案陷入鸿沟;为避免第二次审判，McGinnis先生以325,000美元的价格与麦克唐纳博士定居。 （麦克唐纳博士正在为三个寿命提供服务。）在马尔顿诉讼中，陪审团裁定，而马尔科姆先生归因于马尔顿先生的五种争议的引文中的两个是假的，其中一个是诽谤的，而且没有写过鲁莽地无视真理，允许诽谤赔偿金的标准。</p><p>  In her afterword in the book version of “The Journalist and the Murderer,” Ms. Malcolm dismissed the notion that her criticism of Mr. McGinniss had been a “covert confession” of her treatment of Mr. Masson. And she lamented that because of inaccurate reporting, in The Times and elsewhere, about the Masson suit, she would “always be tainted — a kind of fallen woman of journalism.”</p><p>  在她的“记者和凶手”的书版中，Malcolm女士驳回了她对McGinnis先生的批评，她对Masson先生的待遇是一种“隐秘忏悔”的概念。她感叹了，由于报告不准确，在时代和其他地方，关于马龙套装，她会“总是受到污染的 - 一种新闻的堕落的女人”。</p><p> But with the passage of time, and the explosion of a far more complex and treacherous media landscape, her broadsides against her profession seem almost quaint.</p><p> 但随着时间的推移，以及更复杂和奸诈的媒体景观的爆炸，她的宽阔反对她的职业似乎古怪。</p><p> In fact, “The Journalist and the Murderer” has become something of a classic and was ranked No. 97 on the Modern Library’s list of the  100 best nonfiction books of the 20th century. “It is now taught to nearly every undergraduate studying journalism,” Katie Roiphe wrote in a  2011 profile of Ms. Malcolm for The Paris Review.</p><p> 事实上，“记者和凶手”已成为经典的东西，并在20世纪的100个最佳非小说书籍的现代图书馆列表中排名第97。 “现在曾经教授几乎所有本科学习新闻，”Katie Roiphe在2011年的Malcolm女士审查中写道。</p><p> “Today, my critique seems obvious,” Ms. Malcolm told Ms. Roiphe, “even banal.”</p><p> “今天，我的批评似乎是显而易见的，”马尔科姆女士告诉Roiphe女士，“甚至是平庸”。 </p><p> Many contemporary writers, reviewing her subsequent work, ignore the lengthy legal and ethical entanglements of the McGinniss and Masson cases and have nothing but praise for Ms. Malcolm’s literary skill.</p><p>许多当代作家审查了她的后续工作，忽略了McGinniss和Masson案件的漫长的法律和伦理纠缠，只不为Malcolm女士的文化赞誉。</p><p>  In  a 2019 review in The Times of Ms. Malcolm’s book “Nobody’s Looking at You,” Wyatt Mason referred to the habit of some New Journalists to insert themselves in their stories and noted: “Taking no particular issue with the work of her colleagues, I wish nonetheless to say that Malcolm, line to line, is a more revealing writer, one whose presence in her pieces isn’t meant to advertise the self so much as complicate the subject. And also, line to line, she is a better writer.”</p><p>  在2019年在Malcolm的书“没人看着你”的2019年审查中，Wyatt Mason提到了一些新的记者的习惯，以便在他们的故事中插入自己并指出：“没有特别的问题，她的同事的工作，尽管如此，我希望马尔科姆，行进线，是一个更透露的作家，一个人在她的作品中的存在并不意味着将自我宣传，如此复杂。而且，行到线，她是一个更好的作家。“</p><p> Janet Malcolm was born Jana Klara Wienerova on July 8, 1934, into a well-to-do Jewish family in Prague, in what was then Czechoslovakia. Her mother, Hanna (Taussigova) Wiener, was a lawyer. Her father, Josef Wiener, was a psychiatrist and neurologist.</p><p> Janet Malcolm于1934年7月8日出生于1934年7月8日的Jana Klara Wienerova，进入布拉格的一家犹太犹太家庭，然后是捷克斯洛伐克。她的母亲汉娜（Taussigova）Wiener是一名律师。她的父亲Josef Wiener是一位精神科医生和神经科医生。</p><p> In July 1939, when Janet was almost 5 and her sister, Marie, was a toddler, her parents scraped together enough money to bribe Nazi officials for an exit visa. (Family lore held that their money went to an S.S. officer to buy a racehorse.) The family traveled by train to Hamburg, then to New York on one of the last civilian ships to leave Europe for America before the outbreak of World War II. Upon arrival, they changed their surname to Winn; Jana Klara became Janet Clara.</p><p> 1939年7月，当珍妮特差不多5岁，她的妹妹，玛丽，是一个幼儿，她的父母一起抓住了足够的钱来为退出签证贿赂纳粹官员。 （家人认为他们的钱去了S..官员买一个赛马。）由火车前往汉堡的家庭，然后前往纽约的最后一艘民用船只在第二次世界大战爆发前离开欧洲。抵达后，他们将他们的姓氏改为Winn; Jana Klara成为Janet Clara。</p><p> They initially stayed with relatives in Flatbush, Brooklyn, while her father studied for his medical boards. In 1940 they moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where her father in effect became a village doctor to the large working-class Czech population that lived in the East 70s. Janet’s mother, by then known as Joan, worked for the Voice of America.</p><p> 他们最初在Flatbush，布鲁克林的亲戚住在一起，而她的父亲为医疗委员会学习。 1940年，他们搬到了曼哈顿的上东侧，她的父亲生效成为一个乡村医生，以居住在东70年代的大型工作捷克人口。珍妮特的母亲，当时被称为琼，为美国的声音工作。</p><p> In kindergarten in Brooklyn, Janet had felt lost and stymied by her inability to comprehend English. But she quickly picked up the new language during her early years of schooling in Manhattan, although when her father’s mother moved in with them in 1941 they still spoke Czech at home for her benefit.</p><p> 在布鲁克林幼儿园，珍妮特因无法理解英语而感到迷茫和失去。但她在曼哈顿早期学校教育期间迅速捡起了新语言，尽管当她的父亲的母亲于1941年与他们一起搬进来时，他们仍然在家里谈到了捷克语。</p><p> If learning English came easily to Janet, learning that she was Jewish did not. One day she repeated an anti-Semitic slur, prompting her parents to inform her that she was Jewish. By then she had already internalized the anti-Semitism in the culture, she wrote in a New Yorker essay, “Six Glimpses of the Past” (2018).</p><p> 如果学习英语很容易到珍妮特，学会她是犹太人没有。有一天，她重复了一个反犹太主义的诽谤，促使她的父母告诉她，她是犹太人。然后，她已经在文化中内化了文化中的反犹太主义，她在纽约人文中写道，“过去的六只瞥见”（2018）。 </p><p> “Many years later, I came to acknowledge and treasure my Jewishness,” she wrote. “But during childhood and adolescence I hated and resented and hid it.”</p><p>“多年后，我来承认和珍惜我的犹太人，”她写道。 “但在童年和青春期时，我讨厌并怨恨并隐藏了它。”</p><p> Janet attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then headed for the University of Michigan. She wrote for the school paper, The Michigan Daily, and the campus humor magazine Gargoyle, where, as managing editor, she produced a parody of The New Yorker.</p><p> 珍妮特参加了曼哈顿的高中音乐和艺术，然后前往密歇根大学。她为校刊，密歇根州日报和校园幽默杂志Gargoyle写道，在那里，作为管理编辑，她制作了一个纽约人的模仿。</p><p> “Her keen sense of parody has caught the attention of the campus,” wrote The Michigan Daily. “Many people consider the Gargoyle ‘New Yorker’ parody the finest issue of a college humor magazine ever published.” She graduated in 1955 with a degree in English.</p><p> “她敏锐的模仿感引起了校园的注意，”每天都写了密歇根州。 “很多人认为Gargoyle'纽约人的模仿最优秀的大学幽默杂志出版的问题。”她于1955年毕业，学位用英文学位。</p><p>  While in college, she met and married Donald Malcolm. He, too, was a writer, and they moved to Washington, where they both wrote for The New Republic. When he joined the staff of The New Yorker in 1957, they moved to New York. He later became the magazine’s first Off Broadway drama critic and then a book reviewer. The New Yorker published Ms. Malcolm’s first piece, a six-stanza poem titled “Thoughts on Living in a Shaker House,” in 1963.</p><p>  在大学时，她遇到并结婚的唐纳德马尔科姆。他也是一位作家，他们搬到了华盛顿，他们都为新共和国写道。当他于1957年加入纽约人的员工时，他们搬到了纽约。他后来成为了杂志的第一个百老汇戏剧评论家，然后是一家书籍评论者。纽约人发表了马尔科姆女士的第一片，是1963年的六节诗歌标题为“生活中的思想”。</p><p> Shortly thereafter, her husband, at the age of 32, acquired an unexplained illness that dragged on for years and from which he never recovered. (She  described it to The Telegraph of London in 2013 as “a kind of misdiagnosed  Crohn’s disease” for which he underwent multiple unnecessary surgeries.) He died in 1975 at 43. In  an obituary in The New Yorker, William Shawn, the magazine’s legendary editor, wrote that Mr. Malcolm had been an “immaculate” writer, adding: “Word by word, sentence by sentence, piece by piece, he tried to achieve something flawless, and most of the time he succeeded.”</p><p> 此后不久，她的丈夫在32岁时获得了一种拖累了未解释的疾病，并且他从未恢复过。 （她将其描述为2013年伦敦的电报，作为“一种误诊的克罗恩氏病”，他接受了多种不必要的手术。）他于1975年在43岁时去世。在纽约人，威廉肖恩的奥地利肖恩·肖恩·肖恩（杂志）的传奇中，他去世了。编辑，写道，马尔科姆先生一直是一个“完美无暇”作家，补充说：“单词的单词，句子句子，一块，他试图实现一些完美的东西，大部分时间他成功了。”</p><p> At The New Yorker, Ms. Malcolm started by writing on “women’s” topics like Christmas shopping and children’s books. She also wrote “About the House,” a monthly column on interiors and design. Hers was an expansive definition of “house” and yielded many memorable essays, including  “A House of One’s Own” (1995), in which she described how Virginia Woolf’s sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, had transformed a Sussex farmhouse in England into an outpost for the celebrated artists’ coterie in London known as Bloomsbury.</p><p> 在纽约人，Malcolm女士开始写作“女性”主题，如圣诞节购物和儿童书籍。她还写了“关于房子”，是室内设计和设计的月刊。她是对“房屋”的广泛定义，并产生了许多难忘的论文，包括“一个人自己的房子”（1995年），她描述了弗吉尼亚伍尔夫的姐姐如何改造了英格兰的苏塞克斯农舍变成了一个在伦敦的庆祝艺术家的Coterie称为Bloomsbury的前哨。</p><p>  Among Ms. Malcolm’s first editors at The New Yorker was Gardner Botsford. The intensity of the editing process drew them together, and they married in 1975, after both of their spouses had died. Mr. Botsford, whose stable of New Yorker writers included Roger Angell, A.J. Liebling and Joseph Mitchell,  died in 2004 at 87.</p><p>  Malcolm女士在纽约人的第一个编辑中是加德纳伯特福德。编辑过程的强度将它们放在一起，他们在1975年结婚，经过他们的两个配偶死亡。博克斯福德先生，纽约人作家的稳定包括罗杰安尔，A.J. Luebly和Joseph Mitchell，于2004年在87年死亡。 </p><p> In addition to her daughter, Ms. Malcolm is survived by her sister, Marie Winn; a granddaughter, Sophy Tuck; and two nephews.</p><p>除了女儿外，Malcolm女士在她的妹妹中幸存下来，Marie Winn;孙女，索菲塞克;和两个侄子。</p><p> At her husband’s memorial service, Ms. Malcolm said that during their first editing session, he “transformed bumpy writing into polished prose.” She became so reliant on his deft red pencil, she said, that over the years “I became more blasé about his editing, as one does about indoor plumbing.”</p><p> 在她丈夫的纪念服务中，马尔科姆女士说，在他们的第一次编辑会议期间，他“转变为抛光散文。”她依赖于他的Deft红铅笔如此依赖，她说，多年来，“我变得更加肆虐他的编辑，就像一个关于室内管道的人一样。”</p><p> Another influence on her as a writer stemmed from her decision to give up smoking in 1978. She realized that she couldn’t write without cigarettes, so she avoided writing by immersing herself instead in researching and reporting. The result was a lengthy article called “The One-Way Mirror,” about family therapy.</p><p> 对她的另一个影响因作家源于她的决定，在1978年避免吸烟。她意识到她不能没有香烟写作，所以她避免沉浸在研究和报告中写作。结果是一个冗长的文章，称为“单向镜”，关于家庭治疗。</p><p> “By the time she finished the long period of reporting,” Ms. Roiphe wrote in The Paris Review, “she found she could finally write without smoking, and she had also found her form.”</p><p> “当她完成长期报告的时候，”罗波尔女士在巴黎审查中写道，“她发现她最终没有吸烟，她也能找到她的形式。”</p><p> That idiosyncratic form has been described in different ways by different writers. Ms. Roiphe put it this way: “She takes apart the official line, the accepted story, the court transcript like a mechanic takes apart a car engine and shows us how it works; she narrates how the stories we tell ourselves are made from the vanities and jealousies and weaknesses of their players. This is her obsession, and no one can do it on her level.”</p><p> 已经通过不同作家以不同的方式描述了特殊形式。 Roiphe女士如此：“她分开了官方线，所接受的故事，就像机械师一样，乘坐汽车发动机并向我们展示它是如何工作的;她叙述了我们告诉自己的故事是如何从梳妆台和嫉妒和球员的弱点制成的。这是她的痴迷，没有人可以在她的水平上做到这一点。“ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/business/media/janet-malcolm-dead.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/business/media/janet-malcolm-dead.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/马尔科/">#马尔科</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/malcolm/">#malcolm</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/女士/">#女士</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
