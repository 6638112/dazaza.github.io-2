By day I create web sites and mobile apps, but I often get sucked into other projects.</p><p>我叫Adam Doppelt，我是Fresh Chalk的创始人之一。每天我创建网站和移动应用程序，但是我经常被其他项目吸引。</p><p> Back in 2018 I was between jobs and tossing around startup ideas with a couple of close friends. We didn’t have anything concrete, and my two friends disappeared for simultaneous three week vacations. What was I to do with myself in the meantime?</p><p> 早在2018年，我就在工作之间，并与几个亲密的朋友讨论创业理念。我们没有什么具体的东西，我的两个朋友失踪了三个星期的假期。在此期间我该如何处理自己？</p><p> I decided to buy some doma  ins. I’d toyed with the idea before, but now I had the perfect opportunity to put in a few weeks of sustained effort.</p><p> 我决定买一些doma ins。以前我曾想过这个主意，但现在我有了一个绝好的机会，可以投入数周的不懈努力。</p><p> My three week hobby project eventually mushroomed into a domain portfolio worth over $1M. Along the way I wrote a ton of hairy code and learned quite a bit about the domain business.</p><p> 我为期三周的业余爱好项目最终迅速发展成为价值超过100万美元的域名投资组合。一路上，我写了很多毛茸茸的代码，并学到了很多有关域名业务的知识。</p><p> You can see the domain portfolio here —  https://gurge.com. People are usually pretty shocked when they see the list of domains.</p><p> 您可以在此处查看域名组合-https://gurge.com。人们通常会在看到域列表时感到非常震惊。</p><p>    I initially focused on .io domains, but quickly broadened my scope to include .ai as well. Those two TLDs are often used by startups and I felt like I had decent insight into which domains might appeal to founders. After all, I’ve helped craft names for many tech companies. Surely I’d learned something from the experience?</p><p>    我最初专注于.io域，但很快将我的范围扩展到包括.ai。这两个顶级域名（TLD）通常由初创公司使用，我觉得我对哪些领域可能对创始人有吸引力具有深刻的见解。毕竟，我已经为许多科技公司设计了名字。我肯定从这次经历中学到了什么？</p><p> The first thing I did was conduct a  WHOIS crawl of .ai and .io. The whois system keeps track of who owns each domain, the date it was registered, and when the domain will expire if the owner fails to renew. You can buy whois data, but I’m cheap and I wanted to gather the data myself.</p><p> 我所做的第一件事是对.ai和.io进行WHOIS抓取。 Whois系统会跟踪谁拥有每个域，其注册日期以及如果所有者未能续订该域将在何时到期。您可以购买whois数据，但是我很便宜，我想自己收集数据。 </p><p> I started by building a word list using the trusty  6of12 file as a base. I culled the list to only include words less than 11 letters, which left me with roughly 22,000 words. That’s 44k potential .ai and .io domains.</p><p>我首先以可信任的6of12文件为基础构建单词列表。我筛选出的列表仅包含少于11个字母的单词，这使我大约留下了22,000个单词。这是4万4千个潜在的.ai和.io域。</p><p> My first attempt to crawl whois was a colossal failure. Whois servers have strict rate limiting, and the .ai whois server was particularly stingy. Running more than 10 .ai whois queries in one minute from a single IP would lock you out for hours.</p><p> 我第一次尝试检索whois是一个巨大的失败。 Whois服务器具有严格的速率限制，.ai whois服务器特别小气。从单个IP在一分钟内运行10个以上的.ai whois查询将使您无法使用数小时。</p><p>  That sounds fancy, but it was just a short Ruby script that would ssh to a handful of cloud instances to run whois queries. I like to keep my hobbies cheap and cheerful — no database, no queue, no complexity. Just a CSV file, ssh whois, and my old friend sleep() to honor the rate limits. The results were cached in a Dropbox folder with one file per request. My precious data lives in a single Google Sheet, though I export periodically to feed my scripts.</p><p>  听起来很花哨，但这只是一个简短的Ruby脚本，可以将其切换到少数云实例以运行Whois查询。我喜欢保持自己的爱好便宜而快乐-没有数据库，没有队列，没有复杂性。只是CSV文件，ssh whois和我的老朋友sleep（）来遵守速率限制。结果被缓存在Dropbox文件夹中，每个请求一个文件。尽管我会定期导出以填充脚本，但我的宝贵数据仍保存在单个Google表格中。</p><p> Both crawls completed in a few hours and I was shocked to find that some wonderful domains were unregistered! Why hadn’t anyone registered  Thump.io or  Bullseye.ai? With shaking hands I quickly created an account at Namecheap and registered 50 domains that looked promising. It cost a few thousand dollars.</p><p> 两次爬网都在几个小时内完成，我很震惊地发现一些精彩的域名尚未注册！为什么没有人注册Thump.io或Bullseye.ai？握手后，我迅速在Namecheap创建了一个帐户，并注册了50个看似有希望的域名。它花费了几千美元。</p><p> Now I had a new problem. How could I tell which of the remaining 44k domains were valuable? How could I separate the wheat from the chaff? My instincts were passable but I yearned for data. Luckily I had a bright idea.</p><p> 现在，我遇到了一个新问题。我怎么知道剩下的44k域中哪些是有价值的？我怎样才能从谷壳中分离出小麦呢？我的直觉是可以接受的，但是我渴望获得数据。幸运的是我有一个好主意。</p><p> Google rolled out the .app TLD in mid-2018. Rather than releasing all the domains into the wild on day one, they released the names in stages. It went something like this. On the first day, a .app domain could be registered for $10k. On the second day, a .app domain could be registered for $5k. On the third day, the price dropped to $2.5k. This would continue for ten days.</p><p> 谷歌于2018年中推出了.app TLD。他们没有在第一天就发布所有域名，而是分阶段发布了域名。它像这样。在第一天，.app域的注册费用为1万美元。在第二天，.app域的注册费用为$ 5k。第三天，价格下降到$ 2.5k。这将持续十天。</p><p> Here was my bright idea — a whois crawl of .app would reveal which domains were registered each of those ten days. Clearly, the domains registered on day one were more likely to be valuable than the domains registered on day two. I already had a whois crawler ready to go, so it was trivial to gather the data for .app. Now I had a reasonable way to value prospective .ai and .io domains from my list of 44k. I called my metric  gscore and it became another column in my spreadsheet.</p><p> 这是我的好主意-.app的whois抓取将揭示在那十天中的每一天都注册了哪些域名。显然，第一天注册的域名比第二天注册的域名更有价值。我已经准备好了Whois搜寻器，因此收集.app的数据很简单。现在，我有一个合理的方法可以从我的44k清单中评估潜在的.ai和.io域。我称自己的指标为gscore，它成为了电子表格中的另一列。 </p><p>    The chummy world of domaining is filled with colorful characters. It’s hard to understand what’s happening, and the opacity of domaining is intimidating for newcomers. Especially amateurs like me.</p><p>充满欢乐的域名世界充满了丰富多彩的人物。很难理解正在发生的事情，而且域名的不透明性使新来者感到恐惧。尤其是像我这样的业余爱好者。</p><p> In the beginning I bought domains on auction sites. The best auction site was  park.io, which was friendly, well designed, and transparent. The founder Mike Carson had given a few interviews and seemed like a kindred hacker. Each day, new domains popped up for auction and the bidding was frantic. I bought a few domains, like  Lobster.io. I had no idea if I was overpaying but I was determined to win. Auction sites love naive bidders like me.</p><p> 最初，我是在拍卖网站上购买域名的。最好的拍卖网站是park.io，它友好，精心设计且透明。创始人迈克·卡森（Mike Carson）接受了几次采访，看上去像是一个亲切的黑客。每天都有新的域名涌出进行拍卖，竞标非常激烈。我买了一些域名，例如Lobster.io。我不知道自己是否多付了钱，但我决心赢。拍卖网站喜欢像我这样的天真的竞标者。</p><p> I tried  Flippa, but I couldn’t find many .ai or .io domains and they seemed overpriced even to my untrained eye. Most of the other auction sites were a bust.</p><p> 我尝试过Flippa，但找不到很多.ai或.io域名，即使对我未经培训的人来说，它们似乎也定价过高。其他大多数拍卖场都破产了。</p><p> Within a few days I amassed a starter .io portfolio, spending a few thousand on domains. It was slow and expensive. I began to suspect that I was an  ignorant whale. I considered buying a chunk of the underlying park.io portfolio from Mike, but I couldn’t rid myself of that awful whale feeling.</p><p> 几天之内，我积​​累了一个入门级.io投资组合，在域名上花费了数千美元。它既慢又昂贵。我开始怀疑我是一只无知的鲸鱼。我考虑过从迈克那里购买一小部分潜在的park.io投资组合，但我无法摆脱那种可怕的鲸鱼感觉。</p><p> How could I transform myself from whale into shark? I decided to dig deeper and figure out how to get the domains before they ended up at auction. Surely there was a way.</p><p> 我怎样才能将自己从鲸鱼变成鲨鱼？我决定更深入地研究并弄清楚如何在域名最终拍卖之前获得域名。当然有办法了。</p><p>   In 2018, many people were letting .ai domains expire either on purpose or through neglect. ICANN has a strict process to manage domain expirations, but each TLD implements the rules in different ways. There is a rich ecosystem of companies and individuals attempting to “catch” dropping domains.</p><p>   在2018年，许多人故意让.ai域名过期或被忽视。 ICANN拥有严格的域名过期管理流程，但每个TLD均以不同的方式实施规则。有丰富的公司和个人试图“捕捉”丢弃域的生态系统。</p><p> The .ai TLD is run by the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla. More to the point, the registry is managed by a sharp fellow named Vince Cate, who was recently  written up in the New York Times.</p><p> .ai TLD由加勒比小岛安圭拉运营。更重要的是，该注册表由一个名叫文斯·凯特（Vince Cate）的敏锐学者管理，他最近在《纽约时报》上撰文。 </p><p> Anguilla had a delightful system for domain expiration. If you failed to renew your domain, it would be released on the third Friday of the month at noon. Noon Anguilla time, naturally. In other words, at noon on the third Friday of each month there was a fantastic haul of .ai domains suddenly available for registration. By anyone.</p><p>安圭拉拥有一个令人愉悦的域名过期系统。如果您无法续订域名，则该域名将在该月的第三个星期五中午发布。自然，中午安圭拉时间。换句话说，在每个月的第三个星期五中午，突然都有大量的.ai域名可供注册。被任何人。</p><p>  You could register the domains manually, or create an account directly with Anguilla and use the  EPP system to register a domain. I cautiously created an account with Anguilla, nervously wired them a token amount of money, and started experimenting with EPP.</p><p>  您可以手动注册域，也可以直接在Anguilla中创建帐户，然后使用EPP系统注册域。我谨慎地在安圭拉（Anguilla）建立了一个帐户，紧张地给他们汇了一笔小数目的钱，然后开始尝试EPP。</p><p> I wrote a Ruby script that attempted to use EPP to register dropping .ai domains. I spun up a  Vultr cloud instance in Miami, not far from Anguilla. My script was pretty brain dead, but it was smart enough to focus on the domains that had the highest gscore. I fired the whole thing up at 11:57am Anguilla time and waited.</p><p> 我编写了一个Ruby脚本，试图使用EPP注册删除的.ai域。我在离安圭拉不远的迈阿密旋转了一个Vultr云实例。我的脚本死于脑筋急转，但它足够聪明，可以专注于gscore最高的域。我在安圭拉时间上午11:57放火了一切，然后等待。</p><p> At first it looked like I had single handedly crashed the island of Anguilla, but gradually I started to receive some output. The results were amazing! I snagged  Coffee.ai and  Idea.ai. I got  Payment.ai. By the time the script petered out, I had registered twenty excellent .ai domains. Most of the the action took place in the first 45 seconds. Total cost: $2,000.</p><p> 起初，我似乎单枪匹马撞毁了安圭拉岛，但后来我开始收到一些输出。结果是惊人的！我抓住了Coffee.ai和Idea.ai。我收到了Payment.ai。当脚本逐渐消失时，我已经注册了20个出色的.ai域。大多数动作发生在前45秒内。总费用：2,000美元。</p><p> There were a handful of other people trying to catch .ai domains. You could easily see who won by querying whois. It was an arms race and it turned out I could compete!</p><p> 少数其他人试图捕获.ai域名。您可以通过查询Whois轻松查看谁赢了。那是一场军备竞赛，结果证明我可以参加比赛！</p><p>  I tried my hand at catching .io domains but it didn’t work out as well. The drop times were less predictable and the competition was intense. The APIs available from various registrars were not built for drop catching, and the people running those APIs were understandably not interested in high frequency registration attempts. I could’ve paid more money to get access to better APIs, but the whole enterprise felt uncertain.</p><p>  我尝试抓捕.io域，但效果不佳。下降时间难以预测，竞争激烈。可以从各个注册服务商处获得的API并不是为掉落捕获而构建的，可以理解的是，运行这些API的人员对高频注册尝试并不感兴趣。我本可以花更多的钱来获得更好的API，但是整个企业都感到不确定。</p><p> I was able to grab some winners like  Dependency.io, but for the most part it was a bust.</p><p> 我能够吸引到像Dependency.io这样的赢家，但在大多数情况下，这是一场破产。 </p><p> Plus, more players were getting into the game. Established players with deeper pockets. Hexonet and Dynadot started catching .io domains and selling them at auction. It was easy to see this happening, because my scripts would fail and then I would check whois to see who’d beaten me. I bought a few domains from them at auction, like  Mousetrap.io, but I started to get that nagging whale feeling again.</p><p>另外，越来越多的玩家开始玩游戏。实力雄厚的老牌球员。 Hexonet和Dynadot开始捕获.io域名并在拍卖中出售它们。发生这种情况很容易，因为我的脚本会失败，然后我会检查whois看看谁殴打了我。我在拍卖会上从他们那里购买了一些域名，例如Mousetrap.io，但后来我又开始有了这种wh的感觉。</p><p>    In the fall of 2018 Anguilla wisely decided to move to a  new system and collect more .ai revenue. Instead of dropping expired domains into the hands of hackers like me, they would instead be auctioned off each month. They licensed the excellent software from park.io to run the auctions.</p><p>    在2018年秋天，安圭拉明智地决定迁移到新系统并收取更多.ai收入。与其将过期的域名落入像我这样的黑客手中，不如每个月将它们拍卖出去。他们从park.io许可了出色的软件来进行拍卖。</p><p> For some reason I no longer felt like the dumb money. I owned a sizable portfolio and I had a sense for the value of individual domains. I understood the ecosystem a little more. I had the data. Nobody is a shark at those auctions, but I’d come a long way and felt like I could bid intelligently.</p><p> 由于某种原因，我不再觉得自己是愚蠢的钱。我拥有相当大的投资组合，并且对各个域的价值有所了解。我对生态系统有了更多了解。我有数据。在那些拍卖会上没有人是鲨鱼，但是我走了很长一段路，觉得自己可以明智地出价。</p><p> The first few months I was like a kid in a candy store. I bought a ton of .ai domains at auction and rarely felt like I overpaid. I only bid on domains that I thought would make good startup names. I tried to avoid bidding wars, though I may have gotten carried away with  Clue.ai.</p><p> 头几个月，我就像一个糖果店里的孩子。我在拍卖会上购买了大量的.ai域名，很少觉得自己付了高价。我只出价那些我认为可以成为良好启动名称的域名。尽管我可能对Clue.ai感到迷恋，但我还是努力避免参加竞标战。</p><p> Nothing lasts forever, and eventually the .ai auctions became more competitive. There was one deep-pocketed person in particular who seemed determined to win most of the auctions. The two of us would swoop into the auctions at the last second to do battle, but I almost always let him win. It wasn’t worth the hassle, at least for me.</p><p> 永无止境，最终.ai拍卖变得更具竞争力。特别是有一个财大气粗的人似乎决心赢得大多数拍卖。我们两个人将在最后一秒进入拍卖行，但我几乎总是让他获胜。至少对我来说，这不值得麻烦。</p><p> As the auctions gradually lost their appeal, I tried more experiments with my hard earned data. For example, I tried contacting existing domain owners just before their domain expired. I wanted to have a shot at the best domains before they went up for auction.</p><p> 随着拍卖逐渐失去吸引力，我用辛苦赚来的数据尝试了更多实验。例如，我尝试在域过期之前与现有域所有者联系。我想在最好的域名上拍一下，然后再去拍卖。</p><p> It was a tricky business, tracking down owners and convincing them to part with their neglected domains. I targeted domains that had almost expired and required fees to retrieve, pulled from the ghostly gray mist that looms before final expiration. I actually had good luck with this approach, but it was time consuming. It started to feel like a job.</p><p> 这是一件棘手的事情，要追踪所有者并说服他们放弃自己被忽视的领域。我针对的是即将到期的域名，这些域名要从即将到期前隐约出现的幽灵般的灰色薄雾中拉出来，并且需要收费。我实际上很幸运使用此方法，但是这很耗时。它开始感觉像工作。 </p><p> Besides, Fresh Chalk was getting off the ground and it was time to focus on my startup.</p><p>此外，Fresh Chalk刚刚起步，是时候专注于我的创业了。</p><p>    Have you ever tried to buy a domain? I can’t even tell you how many awful domain landing pages I’ve encountered. Terrible websites, filled with trackers. Vague and unfriendly landing pages. Malware. Domains that don’t resolve, or have broken websites. Redirect loops. Domains that only work with HTTP, or have misconfigured certs. It’s like people don’t even try.</p><p>    您是否曾经尝试购买域名？我什至无法告诉您我遇到了多少糟糕的域名着陆页。糟糕的网站，到处都是追踪器。模糊且不友好的目标网页。恶意软件。无法解析或网站损坏的域。重定向循环。仅适用于HTTP或证书配置错误的域。就像人们甚至没有尝试。</p><p> After some consideration I decided to put up a whimsical landing page, one that fit my personality and felt approachable. All the domains would be listed, along with rough prices. This was extra work, but I was hopeful that it would lead to more transactions. For example —  Admin.ai.</p><p> 经过一番考虑，我决定摆出一个异想天开的登录页面，该页面适合我的个性并且平易近人。将列出所有域以及粗略价格。这是额外的工作，但我希望它将导致更多的交易。例如-Admin.ai。</p><p> I have a single nginx instance running on Vultr. The site is generated with  nanoc using my main CSV (from Google Sheets) as an input. Cloudflare acts as an HTTPS proxy. I use a simple script to add new domains to Cloudflare. I even added an I’M FEELING LUCKY button powered by nginx lua. Cheap and cheerful, as usual.</p><p> 我有一个在Vultr上运行的nginx实例。使用我的主要CSV（来自Google表格）作为输入，使用nanoc生成了该网站。 Cloudflare充当HTTPS代理。我使用一个简单的脚本将新域添加到Cloudflare。我什至还添加了一个由nginx lua驱动的I'M FEELING LUCKY按钮。像往常一样便宜又开朗。</p><p> I also experimented with other domain marketing channels like Sedo and BrandBucket. Those were a complete bust. I don’t think either service generated a single lead.</p><p> 我还尝试了其他域名营销渠道，例如Sedo和BrandBucket。那些都是半身像。我认为这两种服务都无法产生任何线索。</p><p>   Nginx lit up and emails started pouring into my inbox. I nursed each newborn lead even as my gut told me that most of them were unlikely to convert to transactions. I quickly developed a few rules of thumb:</p><p>   Nginx亮起，电子邮件开始涌入我的收件箱。即使我的内心告诉我，大多数新生儿不太可能转为交易，但我仍在照顾每一个新生儿。我很快建立了一些经验法则：</p><p> The vast majority of buyers were new to the process, just like me. They had no idea whether my prices were fair. Buying domains is terrifying and my friendly landing page helps immensely.</p><p> 就像我一样，绝大多数买家都是新手。他们不知道我的价格是否合理。购买域名令人恐惧，我友好的登录页面对您有很大帮助。 </p><p> Lowball offers are extremely common. “I’ll give you $100” is a popular email. Aggressive buyers are eager to pay me $100 this very day!</p><p>Lowball的报价非常普遍。一封受欢迎的电子邮件是“我给你100美元”。激进的买家渴望当天就付给我$ 100！</p><p> Buyers love to concoct complicated schemes. They want to buy ten domains and get a discount. They want to lease domains. They want to avoid escrow. They want to discuss the ethics of domaining. They want a detailed breakdown of my costs.</p><p> 买家喜欢炮制复杂的方案。他们想购买十个域名并获得折扣。他们想租用域名。他们想避免托管。他们想讨论域名道德。他们想要我的费用的详细分类。</p><p> Now that I’ve responded to hundreds of emails and sold dozens of domains, I can tell who’s serious. I keep canned responses in my note taking app. Here’s the first one:</p><p> 现在，我已经回复了数百封电子邮件并出售了数十个域，我可以判断出谁是认真的。我在我的笔记应用程序中保留了罐装回复。这是第一个：</p><p> Hi XXXXX, nice to meet you. The price for XXXXX is XXXXX. Let me know how you would like to proceed. Thanks — Adam</p><p> XXXXX，您好！很高兴认识您。 XXXXX的价格为XXXXX。让我知道您想如何进行。谢谢—亚当</p><p>  Hi XXXXX, nice to meet you. Unfortunately XXXXX is worth quite a bit more. Best of luck! Thanks — Adam</p><p>  XXXXX，您好！很高兴认识您。不幸的是XXXXX值得更多。祝你好运！谢谢—亚当</p><p> I don’t get drawn into discussions about leases or equity. I don’t accept crypto. I don’t get excited when someone is eager to buy ten domains. I don’t do trades. Complexity kills transactions. Many of my canned responses are apologetic.</p><p> 我不会参与有关租赁或权益的讨论。我不接受加密。当有人渴望购买十个域名时，我不会感到兴奋。我不做交易。复杂性会扼杀交易。我的许多罐头回应都是道歉的。</p><p> I’ve found that short, honest responses are the most likely to create trust. There’s less room for ambiguity. These days I barely even negotiate. My prices are fair, and genuine buyers accept that quickly.</p><p> 我发现简短，诚实的回应最有可能建立信任。歧义的空间较小。这些天我什至没有谈判。我的价格公道，真正的买家很快接受了。 </p><p> On the other hand, I’m often moved by personal stories. I’ve given away domains, or sold them for almost nothing. I’ve been very lucky in life, and I try to keep that in mind when buyers hesitantly ask for help. I’ve rarely regretted an act of charity.</p><p>另一方面，我经常被个人故事所打动。我已经放弃了域名，或者几乎一无所获。我一生都很幸运，当买家不愿寻求帮助时，我会尽量记住这一点。我很少后悔慈善行为。</p><p> I’ve also made a few friends, including a handful of repeat buyers. This is a signal that my prices are too low, but life is short and I don’t need to maximize my hobby.</p><p> 我也交了几个朋友，包括几个回头客。这表明我的价格太低，但寿命短，不需要最大化自己的爱好。</p><p>   After we’ve agreed on price, it’s my job to nurse these fragile deals over the finish line through a combination of friendliness and grit. Domain sales always use escrow to protect both buyer and seller.</p><p>   在达成价格协议之后，我的工作是通过友善和勇气相结合，在终点线完成这些脆弱的交易。域名销售始终使用托管来保护买方和卖方。</p><p> My emails are carefully crafted to create a gentle slope between first contact and completed transaction. In the beginning there is no trust and much fear. Gradually as we descend the slope, there is a modicum of trust and the uncertainty recedes somewhat.</p><p> 我的电子邮件经过精心设计，可以在首次联系和完成交易之间形成平缓的倾斜。刚开始时没有信任和恐惧。随着我们逐渐下坡，信任度逐渐降低，不确定性有所降低。</p><p> Buying a domain is super scary. Let me explain in case you ever have to do it:</p><p> 购买域名非常可怕。让我解释一下，以防您必须这样做：</p><p> Escrow.com charges escrow fees as a percentage of sale price. The buyer always pays these fees. That’s because the buyer has some control over the fees, which depend on method of payment. Also, buyers get cold feet. My feet are never anything other than red hot.</p><p> Escrow.com收取代管费（按销售价格的百分比）。买方始终支付这些费用。这是因为买方可以控制费用，具体取决于付款方式。此外，买家会感到冷漠。我的脚只不过是炽热的东西。</p><p> The buyer submits payment to escrow.com. Depending on the method of payment, it might take a few days for the payment to clear. Many buyers are overseas, which can slow things down a little. Escrow.com sends me an email when the payment clears.</p><p> 买方向escrow.com提交付款。根据付款方式的不同，付款可能需要几天的时间才能结清。许多买家在海外，这会使事情放慢一点。付款清除后，Escrow.com给我发送了一封电子邮件。 </p><p> While we wait, I gently encourage the buyer to create an account with a registrar. Some of the domains are hosted with nice registrars that allow a  domain push. If the buyer creates an account, I can push the domain directly into their account for free. The domain is transferred instantly.</p><p>在我们等待的过程中，我鼓励买家向注册服务商创建帐户。一些域名托管在允许域名推送的不错的注册商中。如果买家创建了一个帐户，我可以免费将域名直接直接推送到他们的帐户中。域立即被转移。</p><p> If that isn’t possible, we go through a traditional domain transfer. This process is regulated by ICANN and can take a few days. Super scary, especially since the buyer already paid! I generate an  authcode and send it to the buyer, which allows the buyer to initiate the transfer. Sometimes there are tricky confirmation emails that both buyer and seller have to click.</p><p> 如果不可能，我们将进行传统的域名转移。此过程受ICANN监管，可能需要几天时间。超级吓人，尤其是因为买家已经付款！我生成一个authcode并将其发送给买方，从而允许买方启动转移。有时，买卖双方都必须单击棘手的确认电子邮件。</p><p> After the domain has been transferred and verified, the buyer is supposed to go back to escrow.com and push a button to release the funds to me.</p><p> 域名转移并验证后，买方应返回escrow.com并按一下按钮，将资金释放给我。</p><p> Occasionally buyers do not want to push this button. Sometimes they forget. Sometimes they think they already pushed it. Sometimes they stop responding to emails. I am not worried, though. After a few friendly emails to the buyer I just contact escrow.com support and they are happy to push the button on behalf of the buyer. Escrow.com can verify that the domain was transferred (via whois), and they can contact the buyer directly. I always get paid.</p><p> 有时，买家不希望按下此按钮。有时他们忘记了。有时他们认为他们已经推动了它。有时他们停止回复电子邮件。不过，我并不担心。在向买家发送了几封友好的电子邮件后，我只是联系escrow.com支持，他们很乐意代表买家按下按钮。 Escrow.com可以验证域名是否已通过（whois）转让，并且可以直接与买方联系。我总是得到报酬。</p><p>   My little hobby is bearing fruit. I am extremely busy at  Fresh Chalk, but not too busy to reply to buyers. I still enjoy the auctions and sometimes get carried away. Can I interest you in  Barcode.ai?</p><p>   我的小爱好正在结出果实。我在Fresh Chalk上非常忙，但并不太忙于回复买家。我仍然喜欢拍卖，有时会被带走。我可以对Barcode.ai感兴趣吗？</p><p> I reckon the portfolio is worth roughly $1M. That number is extrapolated from existing sales and assumes that I sell every domain. It probably won’t work out that way, of course. The downturn will affect sales. Time passes and tastes change, even with domains.</p><p> 我认为投资组合的价值约为100万美元。该数字是根据现有销售额推算得出的，并假设我出售每个域。当然，可能不会这样。低迷将影响销售。时间的流逝和口味的改变，即使有领域也是如此。</p><p> Still, I’ve met my original goals. I wrote some code. I learned the ropes. Even factoring in my undoubtedly valuable time, I’m still ahead.</p><p> 不过，我已经实现了最初的目标。我写了一些代码。我学会了绳索。即使算上我宝贵的时间，我仍然领先。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@amd_2793/my-million-dollar-domain-hobby-c74b14db4e64">https://medium.com/@amd_2793/my-million-dollar-domain-hobby-c74b14db4e64</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/域名/">#域名</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dollar/">#dollar</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
