West. Streamed live on Twitter, Facebook Live, and Youtube embed, the show is then edited, sweetened with titles and music, and released on Techcrunch. It\u2019s a kind of hybrid between podcast, Zoom collaboration meeting, and work-from-anywhere encounter group. The Gang grew out of the early days of podcasting, now undergoing rescaffolding from social, drop-in, or just plain fast following from a variety of social networks. The latest entry, Live Audio Rooms from Facebook, is \u201csoft-launching\u201d with verified famous people and creators in good standing up first.\n Facebook typically waits just long enough to decide what features to copy, and appears ready to aggregate the strategies of the rest of the market behind a Facebook infrastructure if not firewall. This may incorporate not just social audio features like tipping and raising hands to speak but also live video streaming and perhaps screen-sharing tools like ones announced at Apple\u2019s WWDC for Facetime. Inevitably, the context returns to Clubhouse and its parallel tech media strategy.\n  Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) debuted their publishing site, and the media tried its best to push back without burning any bridges to the high-flying venture firm. Even more interesting than the future.com website was a Clubhouse Launch Party where we met authors and their editors for about two hours of chat. Marc Andreessen sat in at the beginning, and A16Z partner Margit Wennmachers provided context for the launch. The strategy: project trust and insight from a venture firm and go direct from technologists to the tech and investment audience. It\u2019s an interesting time in the wake of the Trumpian alternative facts blight, where the cable media seems tied in knots by trying to salvage ratings gold with yet another crisis-to-crisis breaking news schtick.\n After that gambit begins to tire, the pitch shifts to the undermining of Democracy by the Autocrats, which although real, is not exactly compelling ratings magic. With vaccinations reaching movie popcorn immunity levels, streaming television is shifting from all out binge releases to the much more familiar weekly cliffhanger model. Working from anywhere is being negotiated based on a hybrid of the best of watching your kids grow up while getting back to a collaborative office when you\u2019ve seen enough of them or them of you.\n On the Gang this time, Keith Teare suggests Netflix may be in a bit of a tough spot, as the easing pandemic puts pressure on new shows slowed down by production lockouts. It\u2019s true: the quality seems to be slipping almost imperceptibly, but nothing is accelerating to put pressure on the Big 4 or 5 Flixes including Disney, Amazon Prime, and maybe Hulu. DiscoBros (Frank Radice\u2019s catchy rebrand for Discovery/WarnerMedia) can be fun, Apple TV+ should buy in to boost production, and then we need to look to the Creator Economy to hurry up and save us.\n Every few days there\u2019s another social audio pivot/acquisition/update, the most interesting besides Facebook\u2019s if you can call it that being Spotify Greenroom with its auto record and captioning features and inevitable integration with its Anchor podcasting tools. Tip jar resistance is almost a thing, in case you\u2019re wondering. The only thing more enervating is speculation on whether Clubhouse is jumping the shark \u2014 I don\u2019t think so. If the Future.com suggests more copying of The Information\u2019s events model, there\u2019s plenty of runway ahead. And social audio gold is anything about Clubhouse on Clubhouse.\n For those of us who still remember tech news, the Apple announcements almost reach orbit with the mixture of M1 magic and iOS/MacOS/WatchOS/TVOS blurring. My favorite list is of features that don\u2019t show up on Intel machines, all the cool ones. For the first time in years, we traded up to M1\u2019s on both our Macbooks including a Pro and Air, and in the process enabled Blur mode on Zoom on both essentially for free. The hardware is starting to feel like a subscription service (HaaS) which as Salesforce\u2019s trajectory suggests is likely a very big deal. (Disclosure: I work for Salesforce.)

The Vienna, Austria-based startup is now live in 18 countries and sees some 400,000 sessions booked monthly on its platform, up 700% year-on-year (and up 15% month-on-month). It says it is on track to double employees to 1,000 and reach 10,000 tutors by the end of this year.\u00a0The plan is to expand to more countries \u2014 Mexico and Canada are next on the list \u2014 and to continue growing its lists of tutors and subjects covered.\n  \u201cWe now plan to be even more aggressive geographically and plan to invest more into the brand,\u201d Felix Ohswald, cofounder and CEO, told TechCrunch.\n  DST Global is leading the round, with SoftBank (via its Vision Fund 2), Tencent, Dragoneer and previous backers Coatue, Left Lane Capital and DN Capital also participating. Vienna, Austria-based GoStudent has raised \u20ac291 million to date, including a  \u20ac70 million round only this past March and  \u20ac13.3 million in a Series A this past November.\n The rapid pace of funding and GoStudent\u2019s rising valuation \u2014 this investment makes it the highest-valued edtech startup in Europe, the company said \u2014 comes amid a streak of funding rounds for edtech companies.\n And that may be no surprise: online and other digital tools in the last year especially felt more relevant (and in many cases were used more) than ever before due to social distancing during the pandemic. (Other recent deals have included funding for  Byju\u2019s,  Kahoot,  Formative,  Engageli,  Lingoda,  Brainly,  ClassDojo,  Newsela, and  Yuanfudao, among many others.)\n But in the case of GoStudent, it\u2019s also because the startup itself is also doing an A+ job in scaling its concept.\n The company has been around since 2016 \u2014 when it started out initially providing a network for people to help each other answer questions (similar to Brainly), as well as connect with tutors, and for tutors to organize classes \u2014 but it was only about 2.5 years ago that GoStudent started to focus more squarely on one-to-one tutoring.\n GoStudent provides a fully-integrated service, which lets students and their parents select from a range of topics that are typically taught in schools \u2014 currently some 30 subjects, including sciences, math, computing, languages, history, business and more \u2014 that they can be tutored on generally or specifically with the aim of taking an exam.\n Tutoring comes from people who are tested, vetted and interviewed by GoStudent before they can join the platform; and before engaging tutors, parents and students interview an individual tutor and go through a practice lesson as part of that.\n Learning plans are then organized according to students\u2019 schedules and what they are setting out to do (they can send over their homework, or chapters they\u2019re studying in school or even a curriculum outline); and the classes, assessments and  payments (based on packages booked), are all handled over the platform, too.\n Although there are a number of ways of learning a subject over the internet today \u2014 and specifically a number of online-only direct tutoring platforms in the market now (including Brainly, Yuanfudao, and others) \u2014 Ohswald said that by and large GoStudent\u2019s biggest competition is the bigger in-person business of teaching, and of students and tutors connecting with each other through word of mouth \u2014 the \u201coffline shadow market of tutors,\u201d as he calls it.\n All the same, while there are tech tools involved in provisioning and running lessons, at its heart GoStudent is also still about humans connecting to help each other, rather than humans connecting with computer programs.\n Interestingly, its founders believe that the Covid-19 pandemic effect was not uniformly positive for its business.\n \u201cThe pandemic had mixed effects,\u201d Ohswald said. \u201cOn the one hand there was a natural demand from kids and parents. But with the schools closed, there was less pressure, less exams, less demand for after-school study. That aspect had a negative effect. But more broadly, there was a BIG boost for digital education. So the mindset of the parent and family drastically shifted.\u201d\n He noted that many families turned to tutoring to help \u201csupport the kids at home, to help them to stop being overwhelmed.\u201d (And I would add, especially in the first part of the lockdown last year when schools were scrambling a little to regroup and teach online, that as a parent, we found it a relief to have at least some consistency with private tutors online at that time.)\n What that means, essentially, is that while GoStudent did well in the last year, the company does not want to tie its growth to a specific set of pandemic circumstances that may well become less of an issue in the year ahead.\n Indeed, for better or worse, there  are bigger factors at play that predate the pandemic. Increasing pressure on students to perform their best competing against others, a continuing focus on testing, and a general level of academic ambition; but also a much easier and cheaper way of finding and connecting with people who can help students feel more supported in their efforts: all of these are also playing a role.\n \u201cGoStudent is one of the fastest growing companies that we have ever backed. The company has grown 800% in terms of revenue and 70x in terms of value since 2020 and we are convinced that this is just the beginning,\u201d Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, DN Capital, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe believe that GoStudent can become one of the top digital schools in the world.

Best  communication of the idea wins, as do the people behind them.\u00a0\u00a0  The most powerful communication tool might be a snappy meme these days, but in business, it\u2019s still the written word. Writing well supercharges your trajectory. Yet great writing is rare. Why?   Turns out we\u2019ve been taught some things that simply don\u2019t apply:\n  Writing well lifts many boats: emails, scoping docs, strategy docs, analysis, resumes. We\u2019ll cover how to rescue bad writing, then how to upgrade from good to great.\u00a0 \u200d\n  What\u2019s the biggest difference between great writers and all the rest? It\u2019s not talent, it\u2019s treating the process like a product.     Your reader is your customer. Your first draft is pre-MVP. To get to a quality shippable version, you need to iterate, aka edit.\u00a0  Amount of editing time depends on importance and length. A status update might require 10 minutes, but a strategy doc closer to a few days.\u00a0\u00a0  Your first draft is your R&amp;D: get ideas on paper and clarify your thinking. Your subsequent drafts are marketing: edit from your reader\u2019s perspective to make your points persuasive. \u200d\n  Bad writing is hard to follow because it\u2019s stream-of-consciousness which tends to leap around. Ironically, the magic of creative thinking comes from leaping and making unexpected connections. But to be appreciated for its brilliance, creative thinking needs to be  translated into coherent writing.\n  Ideas are generated bottom-up and sometimes sideways, but they need to be communicated top-down. \u00a0  Coherence starts with making your point upfront. If your goal is to solve a problem, start with stating it simply (e.g., sign-up conversion dropped to all-time low of 2%). If your goal is to provide an update, start with the most important change.\u00a0  Answer the question:  why should I continue reading this? People need context, but before that, they need to know why they should care.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Bad writing is logically unsound. The points are disconnected from each other.   Example: we have low retention, so we should email more \u2014 this might help, might hurt; impossible to know until you define retention, diagnose the root of the problem and review impact of existing emails on retention. \u00a0  Your points should fit like a jigsaw puzzle, each connected to another. \u00a0  Read like a skeptic.  Ask:  So what? How is this related? Does this make sense? at every turn. The clearer your writing, the fewer interruptions need to be made downstream in the form of meetings and back-and-forths. Clarity gives you leverage.  More questions worth asking, inspired by  this Tweet thread:\n    A classic lesson from consulting 101 is to expect that your reader is busy.\u00a0Use headers,  selective bolding and bullets to make your message loud and clear. When you make it skimmable, it\u2019s more likely to be read in full.\u00a0   Easy on the eyes, not an intimidating wall of text:\n    Every word should serve a purpose. Every sentence should make you want to read the next one.  Prime darlings to kill: words that are redundant and weak.\u00a0   Redundant words say the same thing twice. Examples: \u201cnew invention, \u201crival competitor\u201d, \u201cactual fact\u201d, \u201cvery unique\u201d, \u201call throughout\u201d. They bore your reader and bloat your writing.   Weak words lack meaning and specificity. If it\u2019s not moving your argument forward, it\u2019s holding it back. Examples: \u201cnice\u201d, \u201creally\u201d, \u201cvery\u201d, \u201cthing\u201d, \u201camazing\u201d\u00a0  At this point, you\u2019ll reach a good baseline. To get to great, we need some extra spice. \u200d\n  A well-known storytelling rule: use \u201cbut and therefore\u201d instead of \u201cand then\u201d to create action and tension. This same principle helps you tease out nuance.  \u200d\n Version A: \u201cWe want the customer to feel X, but right now they struggle with Y, therefore we need Z\u201d.\u00a0   Version B: \u201cWe want the customer to feel X, and also they struggle with Y, and by the way, we need Z\u201d.\n Version A gives you the space to diagnose the struggle, and lay out cause and effect. It frames the narrative persuasively. Version B throws too many seemingly unrelated things together. It puts the burden on the reader to untangle what\u2019s really going on.\u00a0   Not surprisingly,  people who use \u201cbut and therefore\u201d tend to be perceived as more senior than those who use the more simplistic \u201cand then\u201d. Framing matters. \u200d\n  Clear and concise writing gets you access to the mind, but color and emotion gets you access to the heart. To make people excited to act, paint a vivid picture of what can be created.\u00a0\u00a0  Customer quotes underscoring the pain of the present are a great starting point. Then bring in colorful details of what they can feel and become as a result:\n We are asking a lot from our customers.\u00a0We are asking them to spend hours a day in a new and unfamiliar application, to give up on years or even decades of experience using email for work communication\u2026   To get people to say yes to a request that large, we need to (1) offer them a reward big enough to justify their effort and (2) do an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution.   The best way to imagine the reward is thinking about who we want our customers to become: \u200d \u2022 We want them to become masters of their own information and not slaves, overwhelmed by the neverending flow.  \u2022 We want them to feel less frustrated by a lack of visibility into what is going on with their team. \u2022 We want them to become people who communicate purposefully, knowing that each question they ask is actually building value for the whole team.  \u200dSource:  Slack CEO\n Another approach is to name your future customers and describe how your product enhances their life. Work backwards from the future.  \u200d\n  Neil deGrasse Tyson is a delight to listen to. His secret: he\u2019s written down pretty much everything he says in public.  By battle-testing words on paper first, Neil is far more eloquent when he speaks.\u00a0   You can do the same. The cycle of writing and editing prepares you for real-time moments in interviews and meetings especially if charisma doesn\u2019t come naturally.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Writing is  the meta-skill of modern business. Easy writing makes for hard reading, so instead of aiming for easy, invest in the process of editing.   Start with unrestrained creation, and end with ruthless deletion until there is nothing more to take away. \u200d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 14:05:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5bf9\u5f85,writing,\u9700\u8981", "title": "\u50cf\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u4f60\u7684\u5199\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Treat your writing like a product", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.productlessons.xyz/article/improve-business-writing-skills-with-examples", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bf9\u5f85", "writing", "\u9700\u8981"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b7a4d301ac6e3791bdb6168ee2b80349.png", "infoid": 1067368, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4e3a\u6211\u7684IB\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u51b3\u8d5b\u5199\u4e86\u4e00\u7bc7\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u7531\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u7ecf\u7406\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u6211\u4ece\u6211\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\n \u4e00\u5982\u65e2\u5f80\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u4f60\u53ea\u662f\u6709\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u4e0e\u6211\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\n    \u514d\u8d39\u8f6f\u4ef6\u514d\u82b1\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u4e2d - \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u5168\u90e8\uff0c\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4eba\u5458\u719f\u6089\u81ea\u7531\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4f46\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\uff1f\u514d\u8d39\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08\u6216FOSS\uff09\u662f\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u4e0b\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6700\u5927\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u4e00\u662fLinux\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u7531\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u542c\u8bf4\u8fc7Linux\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u652f\u6301ChromeoS\uff0cAndroid\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570IoT\u8bbe\u5907\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5927\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\uff0339;

It&#39;s heavily inspired by the Freakonomics movie. I&#39;ve made minimal changes from the version I submitted.\n As always, if something is wrong or you just have an opinion to share, feel free to  contact me.\n    Free software\u2014free as in freedom\u2014is a cornerstone of the current software environment. Most, if not all, of the apps people are familiar with use code from free software. But what even is free software? Free open-source software (or FOSS) is software whose code is publicly available under a license that allows the use of the code in your projects. One of the largest FOSS projects in the world is the Linux kernel, which is freely available. You might not have heard of the Linux kernel, but it is the software that powers ChromeOS, Android, most IoT devices, and the majority of the world&#39;s servers. It is only alive because of the millions of dollars in donations it receives from companies which depend on the software. However, there are pieces of FOSS software that someone has been thanklessly maintaining for decades with no pay.\n  This is clearly an issue. The current state of software is such that everything depends on everything else. If one essential component ceases to be maintained, or is sold to another (more malicious) actor, the software which depends on it will break. So how do we prevent this? FOSS is typically created by individuals, not by corporations (although there is a shift toward FOSS companies), and since the software is free, you can not sell or license it to make money.\n  The developer is bored of the project and does not want to keep on supporting it, since it was originally a passion or a school project.\n The project has gotten out of hand and is really large, so it is difficult to maintain.\n The project&#39;s main users are people who are not particularly computer literate, therefore there is an abundance of support requests that would be considered idiotic (lack of patience).\n There is a better alternative available so the developer stops working on the current project.\n  The developer&#39;s priorities may shift away from the project and toward work or something else.\n Each and every one of these reasons has already happened in real life and caused issues for consumers. One perfect example is the \u201cThe Great Suspender\u201d fiasco. The FOSS extension was sold to another person who uploaded a malicious version of the program to Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store. This caused a mass exodus from the extension subsequently leading to the extension not being used. The source code for the program has not been updated since October of 2020 and the extension has been pulled from the store. The school had approved of this extension for use, and it still failed since there was no real incentive to not sell the program.\n So how does this relate to economics? It is clear that FOSS has a massive social benefit, but the private benefit to the developer is very low. Therefore,  incentives matter. In order for the developers to continue their projects, they must have an incentive to do so. Currently, for smaller projects, the incentive is a sense of obligation the developers have to their users. Naturally, the developers do not want to abandon their users, but a situation may arise that a proper incentive would fix. Therefore, by donating money to developers, you prevent the project from being abandoned. Some people have a large salary from their open source projects, such as the Haxx team which created the  de facto HTTP client library that is used across every platform. They have many sponsors because these sponsors realize that if this project goes under, so does the company&#39;s software. Unfortunately, it is common that only the larger projects are funded to the point where the developers can make aliving off of it.\n Along with incentives mattering, one of the incentives listed earlier included how technology could change, leading to the depreciation of a project. The  technological change especially in the software industry, leads to shifts in popular software. One notable exception is the C programming language, which has been around since 1972 and is still the number one choice for high-performance or systems applications (although this paradigm has been shifting slightly toward the Rust programming language). With the introduction of new languages, such as Rust, many developers decide to rewrite their projects (see the RIIR movement), or create a new one entirely. A real-world example of technological change would be something like Adobe Flash. Technologies like JavaScript and WASM depreciated Flash, leading to legacy Flash programs being unavailable to people today. Movements have been made to archive the Flash programs, but all of the software that had to do with Flash (and the few companies that depend on Flash still) were left out in the rain.\n Technological change is linked with  competition and efficacy, since with the shifts in technology, new programs rise as well. In the late 1980&#39;s, the open-source kernel of choice was GNU Hurd. However, with the release of the Linux kernel in the early 1990&#39;s, GNU Hurd was driven out as a viable choice and now is delegated to experimentalists and enthusiasts. This open source project has still been kept alive by a small but dedicated group of people. There has still been no official stable release and the time between code changes is typically weeks.Competition typically leads to a shift in consumer tastes, so the  supply, demand, and equilibrium price changes as well. In terms of free software, the price is zero, so theoretically demand should be infinite. This is not the case, with non-free software still dominating on some platforms, such asWindows, MacOS, and so on.\n  Therefore, there must be some costs to the software beyond monetary costs that we must account for. Many FOSS projects require a higher learning curve and implementation costs than popular non-free alternatives. A wonderful example of this is Microsoft Word. The leading FOSS alternative to Word is LibreOffice Writer. Writer has many issues, such as compatibility problems with DOCX files, lack of features, and difficulty of use. So, there is an implicit \u201ccost\u201d of using FOSS, or with using anything for that matter. The other important part of the graph is the supply curve. There are two possibilities for the supply curve: perfectly inelastic (as outlined in figure 1.1), representing that the developers are willing to accept any money but that will not change how much software is released. But this runs into another issue with the supply and demand graph: software is free to download, and you can copy it for free. Therefore, there is an infinite supply of the software, but not an infinite quantity supplied, since that must be at an equilibrium point. So what could cause the supply and demand to shift? Again, a shift in consumer tastes, a change in the inputs for production (more developers working on a project), or any other economic concept, proving that free stuff still has to abide by the laws of supply and demand.\n Linked perfectly with supply / demand and consumer tastes,  the \u201csnob effect\u201d in consumer purchasing is a major player in software. With such a wide diversity in software, people who use one program are viewed as \u201cbetter\u201d than people who use another. A perfect example of this is Apple. Apple&#39;s MacOS (which you can only legally receive with an Apple computer) is considered the \u201csnob\u201d of the operating systems, while those who use Linux or another more niche product are considered to be nerds. People pay top dollar to not use free software because if it is free, it is seen as being a second-rate, inferior product. FOSS projects fail because they are seen as second-rate to an already-existing non-free product. In July of 2000, Microsoft&#39;s CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \u201ccommunism\u201d:\n [T]o emphasise the competitive threat, and in some senses the competitive opportunity, that Linux represents. Linux is a tough competitor. There&#39;s no company called Linux, there&#39;s barely a Linux road map. Yet Linux sort of springs organically from the earth. And it had, you know, the characteristics of communism that people love so very, very much about it. That is, it&#39;s free.\n For more than the next decade, Microsoft continued to make Linux seem as a second rate product that only nerds and communists use, cementing Windows&#39;s position as expensive but the best, similarly to Apple&#39;s products. Ballmer also called the free-software movement and Linux \u201ccancer\u201d the next year. All of this naturally shifted demand left via the \u201csnob effect\u201d and set the community back a decade.\n  So what do we do in order to incentivise developers to continue their essential projects? Simple: we give them money. As stated earlier, the marginal social benefit is much higher than the marginal private benefit. Therefore, if MPB is increased so that it equals MSB, society is better off.\n  In figure 3.1, we see the current situation. Society is better off than the developer, so there is a deadweight loss (in red). To move MPB to MSB, we pay the developer. In fact, others have already thought of this idea. GitHub, the leader in open-source software hosting, has implemented a feature called \u201cSponsors\u201d in which a person or a company can sponsor a GitHub organization or individual. GitHub takes no cut. This is suitable for small and large scale products and replaces similar methods such as a Patreon or a simple Paypal transfer. Another method that can be used is an official sponsorship. Because companies use some of the FOSS code, they want it to continue, so they sponsor the project. For example, Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution that is built to replace CentOS. They have gotten sponsors because the companies want a replacement for CentOS. Lastly, there is the sellout option. Selling the software to a third party would only temporarily increase MPB to equal MSB. At that point the software would fail, as it did with the Great Suspender. So where does that leave developers? It is difficult to get funding from individuals since people usually do not want to pay money. This follows that, if the developers want to make money from their FOSS projects, they will make something worth donating to.\n    Lea, Graham. \u201cMS&#39; Ballmer: Linux Is Communism.\u201d The Register, 21 May 2000, https://www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/ms_ballmer_linux_is_communism/.

", "note_en": "Tesla has unveiled its new supercomputer, which is already the fifth most powerful in the world, and it\u2019s going to be the predecessor of Tesla\u2019s upcoming new Dojo supercomputer.\n It is being used to train the neural nets powering Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and upcoming self-driving AI.\n  Over the last few years, Tesla has had a clear focus on computing power both inside and outside its vehicles.\n Inside, it needs computers powerful enough to run its self-driving software, and outside, it needs supercomputers to train its self-driving software powered by neural nets that are fed an insane amount of data coming from the fleet.\n CEO Elon Musk has been teasing Tesla\u2019s Dojo project, which apparently  consists of a supercomputer capable of an\u00a0exaFLOP,\u00a0one quintillion (10 18) floating-point operations per second, or 1,000 petaFLOPS \u2013 making it one of the most powerful computers in the world.\n Tesla has been working on Dojo for the last few years, and Musk has been hinting that it should be ready by the end of this year.\n But the company has developed other supercomputers on its way to Dojo, and now Andrej Karpathy, Tesla\u2019s head of AI, has unveiled the latest one during a presentation at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\n During the presentation, Karpathy gave a shoutout to Tesla\u2019s supercomputing team and showcased their latest work, Tesla\u2019s third supercomputer cluster:\n  Tesla is claiming some fairly insane specs on this new cluster, which should make it roughly the fifth most-powerful computer in the world:\n   \u201cWe have a neural net architecture network and we have a data set, a 1.5 petabytes data set that requires a huge amount of computing. So I wanted to give a plug to this insane supercomputer that we are building and using now. For us, computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and what enables Autopilot. And for that to work really well, we need to master the data from the fleet, and train massive neural nets and experiment a lot. So we invested a lot into the compute. In this case, we have a cluster that we built with 720 nodes of 8x A100 of the 80GB version. So this is a massive supercomputer. I actually think that in terms of flops, it\u2019s roughly the number 5 supercomputer in the world.\u201d\n The Tesla engineer didn\u2019t want to elaborate on project Dojo, but he did say that it will be an even better supercomputer optimized for neural net training than Tesla\u2019s current cluster.\n Musk also previously said that Tesla plans to eventually\u00a0 make its supercomputers available to other companies in order for them to train their neural nets on it.\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.
