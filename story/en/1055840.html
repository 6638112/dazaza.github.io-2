Just about all of the predictions  whiffed. Anthony Fauci was  wrong about masks. California was  wrong about the outdoors. New York was  wrong about the subways. I was wrong about  the necessary cost of pandemic relief. And the Trump White House was wrong about  almost  everything  else.</p><p>大流行使许多预报员的傻瓜。只是关于所有的预测膨胀。 Anthony Fauci对面具错了。加利福尼亚州对户外玩弄了。纽约对地铁错了。关于大流行缓解的必要性成本，我错了。特朗普白宫几乎是关于其他一切的错。</p><p>   In this crowded field of wrongness, one voice stands out. The voice of Alex Berenson: the former  New York Times reporter, Yale-educated novelist, avid tweeter, online essayist, and all-around pandemic gadfly. Berenson has been serving up COVID-19 hot takes for the past year, blithely  predicting that the United States would not reach 500,000 deaths (we’ve surpassed 550,000) and  arguing that cloth and surgical masks can’t protect against the coronavirus ( yes,  they  can).</p><p>   在这拥挤的错误领域，一个声音脱颖而出。 Alex Berenson的声音：前纽约时报记者，耶鲁教育的小说家，狂热的推特，在线散文家和全面大流行侏儒。贝伦森一直在过去一年的Covid-19热门，这一点顺利地预测美国不会达到500,000人死亡（我们超过550,000）并争论布和外科口罩不能防止冠状病毒（是的，他们能）。</p><p> Berenson has a big megaphone. He has more than 200,000 followers on Twitter and millions of viewers for his frequent appearances on Fox News’ most-watched shows. On Laura Ingraham’s show, he  downplayed the vaccines, suggesting that Israel’s experience proved they were considerably less effective than initially claimed. On  Tucker Carlson Tonight, he  predicted that the vaccines would cause an uptick in cases of COVID-related illness and death in the U.S.</p><p> Berenson有一个大扩音器。他在Twitter上拥有超过20万粉丝，以及数百万观众，为福克斯新闻大多数观看节目常见。在Laura Ingraham的节目中，他淡化了疫苗，这表明以色列的经验证明它们比最初声称的效果效益得多。在Tucker Carlson今晚，他预测，疫苗将在Covid相关疾病和死亡案件中引起上涨。</p><p>  The vaccines have inspired his most troubling comments. For the past few weeks on Twitter, Berenson has mischaracterized just about every detail regarding the vaccines to make the dubious case that most people would be better off avoiding them. As his conspiratorial nonsense accelerates toward the pandemic’s finish line, he has proved himself  the Secretariat of being wrong:</p><p>  疫苗激发了他最麻烦的评论。在Twitter过去几周的几周里，Berenson在关于疫苗的每个细节上都有比较细节，以使大多数人更好地避免它们的可疑案例。由于他的阴谋废话促进了大流行的终点线，他已经证明自己是错误的秘书处：</p><p> He has blamed the vaccines for causing spikes  in severe illness, by pointing to data that actually demonstrate their safety and effectiveness.</p><p> 他通过指向实际证明其安全性和有效性的数据来​​引起严重疾病中的尖峰，使疫苗归咎于疫苗。</p><p>  He has blamed the vaccines for  suppressing  our immune systems, by misrepresenting normal immune-system behavior.</p><p>  他已经归咎于抑制我们免疫系统的疫苗，通过歪曲正常的免疫系统行为。</p><p>  He has suggested that  countries such as Israel have suffered from their early vaccine rollout, even though deaths and hospitalizations among vaccinated groups in Israel have plummeted.</p><p>  他建议以色列等国家遭受早期疫苗推出，即使以色列疫苗的疫苗中的死亡和住院都暴跌暴跌。 </p><p>  He has implied that for most non-seniors, the side effects of the vaccines are worse than having COVID-19 itself—even though, according to the CDC, the pandemic has killed  tens of thousands of people under 50 and the vaccines  have not conclusively killed anybody.</p><p>他暗示为大多数非老年人，疫苗的副作用比Covid-19本身更糟糕 - 尽管根据CDC，大流行病已经造成50岁以下的成千上万的人，并且疫苗没有得出结论杀了任何人。</p><p>  Usually, I would refrain from lavishing attention on someone so blatantly incorrect. But with vaccine resistance  hovering around 30 percent of the general population, and with 40 percent of Republicans saying they won’t get a shot, debunking vaccine skepticism, particularly in right-wing circles, is a matter of life and death.</p><p>  通常，我会避免注意一个如此公然不正确的人。但疫苗抵抗悬浮在普通人口的30％左右，占共和人的40％，称他们不会得到射门，揭穿疫苗怀疑，特别是在右翼圈，是生死攸关的问题。</p><p>   Berenson’s TV appearances are more misdirection than outright fiction, and his Twitter feed blends internet-y irony and scientific jargon in a way that may obscure what he’s actually saying. To pin him down, I emailed several questions to him last week. Below, I will lay out, as clearly and fairly as I can, his claims about the vaccines and how dangerously, unflaggingly, and superlatively wrong they are.</p><p>   Berenson的电视外观比直接小说更加误解，他的Twitter饲料融合了Internet-y讽刺和科学术语，这可能会掩盖他的实际说什么。将他贴在一起，我上周向他发送了几个问题。下面，我将尽可能清晰地铺设，他可以尽可能地，他对疫苗的索赔以及如何危险，不合适，且最大的错误。</p><p> Before I go point by point through his wrong positions, let me be exquisitely clear about  what is true. The vaccines work. They worked in the clinical trials, and they’re working around the world. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson seem to provide  stronger and more lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants than natural infection. They are  excellent at reducing symptomatic infection. Even better, they are extraordinarily  successful at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Countries that have vaccinated large percentages of their population quickly, such as the U.S., the United Kingdom, and Israel, have all seen sharp and sustained declines in hospitalizations among the elderly. Meanwhile, countries that have lagged in the vaccination effort—including the U.K.’s neighbors France and Italy, and Israel’s neighbor Jordan—have struggled to contain the virus. The authorized vaccines are marvels, and the case against them relies on half-truths, untruths, and obfuscations.</p><p> 在我通过错误的职位到达点之前，让我明确了解什么是真实的。疫苗工作。他们在临床试验中工作，他们正在全世界工作。来自PFizer-Biontech，Moderna和Johnson＆amp的疫苗;约翰逊似乎为SARS-COV-2及其变体提供更强，更持久的保护，而不是自然感染。它们在减少症状感染方面很好。甚至更好，它们在防止Covid-19预防严重疾病时非常成功。迅速接种占据大量人口的国家，例如美国，英国和以色列，在老年人的住院中都有急剧和持续下滑。与此同时，在疫苗接种措施中落后的国家 - 包括U..的邻国法国和意大利，而以色列的邻居约旦 - 努力遏制病毒。授权的疫苗是奇迹，而对他们的案例依赖于半真半假，不忍忍者和混淆。</p><p>  Berenson’s claim: In country after country, “cases rise after vaccination campaigns begin,” he wrote in an email.</p><p>  Berenson的索赔：在国家之后的国家，“疫苗接种活动开始后案件上升，”他在一封电子邮件中写道。</p><p> One of Berenson’s themes is that the mRNA vaccines are badly underperforming outside the clinical trials and are possibly even causing a spike in cases after the first shot. But just this week, CDC researchers studying real-world conditions came to the opposite  conclusion: The mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer are 90 percent effective two weeks after the second dose, in line with the trial data. “COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons,” they concluded.</p><p> Berenson的主题之一是MRNA疫苗在临床试验外面的表现不佳，并且在第一次射击后可能甚至导致刺激。但是，只需本周，CDC研究人员研究了真实世界的条件的结论：现代和辉瑞的MRNA疫苗在第二剂后两周的90％，符合试验数据。他们的所有符合条件的人建议了“Covid-19疫苗接种”，“他们结束。</p><p> Still, Berenson pushes the argument that the vaccines are causing suspicious illness and death. On  Twitter and in his email to me, Berenson claimed that  an “excellent” Denmark study showed a 40 percent rise in infections immediately after nursing-home residents received their first vaccine shot.</p><p> 不过，Berenson推动了疫苗造成可疑疾病和死亡的论点。在Twitter和他的电子邮件上给了我，Berenson声称，在护理家庭居民收到他们的第一个疫苗射击后，“优秀的”丹麦研究表明，感染率为40％。 </p><p> I reached out to  that study’s lead author, Ida Rask Moustsen-Helms at the Statens Serum Institut, who said that Berenson had mischaracterized her findings. She explained to me that the Danish nursing homes in question were already experiencing a significant COVID-19 outbreak when vaccinations began. Many people in the long-term-care facilities were likely already sick before their vaccine was administered, and “these people would technically count as vaccinated with confirmed COVID-19, even if the infection happened prior to the vaccination or its immune response,” she said. With limited vaccines, countries ought to give the first vaccines to the groups most likely to get COVID-19. That’s exactly what seems to have happened here. Berenson is scaremongering about the vaccines by essentially criticizing their wise distribution.</p><p>我向该研究的领先作者达成了这个研究的血清Institut的Ida Rask Moustsen-helms，他说Berenson已经减少了她的发现。她向我解释说，当接种疫苗开始时，有问题的丹麦护理家庭已经在经历了重要的Covid-19爆发。在长期护理设施中的许多人可能已经生病了，然后在他们的疫苗之前已经生病，“这些人在技术上算是用确认的Covid-19接种的疫苗，即使感染发生在疫苗接种之前或其免疫应答之前，即使感染或其免疫反应）她说。随着疫苗有限的，国家应该向最有可能获得Covid-19的群体提供第一个疫苗。这正是在这里发生的事情。 Berenson基本上批评他们的明智分销是疫苗散发出疫苗。</p><p>  In our emails, Berenson further argued that many of the perceived benefits of the vaccines are illusory. “It is very hard to distinguish the course of the epidemic this winter in countries that have vaccinated heavily, such as Israel and the UK, and those that have not, such as Canada and Germany,” he wrote.</p><p>  在我们的电子邮件中，Berenson进一步认为，许多疫苗的感知益处都是虚幻的。 “这冬季很难区分疫情的疫情，这些国家，如以色列和英国，以及没有加拿大和德国的那些，”他写道。</p><p> This is hogwash. In the U.K. and Israel, hospitalizations have fallen by at least 70 percent since mid-January, and they remain low. In  Canada, hospitalizations fell by significantly less, and in Germany, the seven-day average of COVID-19 cases has more than  doubled since mid-February; its government has  debated a new lockdown.</p><p> 这是婆婆。在U.k.和以色列，自1月中旬以来，住院治疗至少70％，他们仍然很低。在加拿大，住院治疗大幅下降，德国，七天的Covid-19案件平均分为二月中旬以来一倍多;它的政府已经辩论了一个新的锁定。</p><p> This stage of the pandemic is a race between the variants and the vaccines. In many states, such as Michigan and New York, normalizing behavior combined with more contagious strains of the virus are pushing up cases again. This is not evidence that America’s vaccination campaign isn’t working. Quite the opposite: It highlights the urgency of moving faster to deliver vaccines, which are our best chance to control the spread of contagious variants.</p><p> 大流行的这个阶段是变体和疫苗之间的种族。在许多州，如密歇根和纽约，正常化行为与病毒的更具传染性菌株相结合正在再次推动案例。这不是美国疫苗接种活动不起作用的证据。相反：它突出了移动疫苗的速度速度的紧迫性，这是控制传染性变种传播的最佳机会。</p><p> Berenson’s claim: Pfizer-BioNTech’s clinical-trial data prove that the companies are being shady about vaccine efficacy.</p><p> Berenson的索赔：PFizer-Biontech的临床试验数据证明了这些公司正在阴暗关于疫苗疗效。</p><p> Berenson seems to enjoy spelunking through research to find esoteric statistics that he then dresses up with spooky language to make confusing points that sow doubt about the vaccines. Arguing that COVID-19 cases spike after the first dose, he  directs people to the  Pfizer-BioNTech FDA briefing document, which reports hundreds of “suspected but unconfirmed” COVID-19 cases in the trial’s vaccine group that aren’t counted as positive cases in the final efficacy analysis.</p><p> Berenson似乎通过研究享受剥夺，寻找疏远统计数据，然后他用幽灵般的语言扮演，以使令人困惑的点播种对疫苗怀疑。争论Covid-19案例飙升第一剂量后，他将人们指导到PFizer-Biontech FDA简报文件，其中报告了数百名“怀疑但未证实的”Covid-19患者在试验的疫苗组中不计入积极案件在最终的疗效分析中。</p><p>  But “suspected but unconfirmed” doesn’t refer to participants who were probably sick with COVID-19. On the contrary, it refers to participants who reported various symptoms, such as a cough or a sore throat, and then took a PCR test— and then that test came back negative.</p><p>  但是“怀疑但未证实”并没有提到与Covid-19患病的参与者。相反，它指的是报告了各种症状的参与者，例如咳嗽或喉咙痛，然后进行PCR测试 - 然后该测试恢复负面。 </p><p> “His point is absolutely stupid, and I would know because I enrolled participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial,” Kawsar Talaat, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, told me. “He’s talking about people who call in and say, ‘I have a runny nose.’ So we mark them as ‘suspected.’ Then we ask them to take a PCR test, and we test their swab, and if the test comes back negative, the FDA says it’s ‘unconfirmed.’ That’s what  suspected but unconfirmed means.”</p><p>“他的观点绝对是愚蠢的，我会知道，因为我参加了参与者参加了辉瑞 - 比翁·审判的参与者，”Johns Hopkin大学助理教授Kawsar Talaat告诉我。 “他正在谈论那些打电话，说'我有流鼻涕的人。所以我们把它们标记为”怀疑“。然后我们要求他们采取PCR测试，我们测试他们的拭子，如果测试回来消极的，FDA说这是“未经证实的。”这就是怀疑但未证实的意思。“</p><p>  When I emailed Pfizer and BioNTech representatives about Berenson’s claim, they struggled to even understand what I was talking about. Someone was taking a group of several thousand people who had tested negative for COVID-19 and, from afar, diagnosing all of them with COVID-19? “Does not make sense,” a BioNTech spokesperson responded curtly.</p><p>  当我通过电子邮件发送给Berenson主张的辉瑞兹和Biontech代表时，他们努力了解我在谈论的内容。有人拿走了一批几千人，他们对Covid-19的负面测试了负面，并且从远处诊断了所有人的Covid-19？ “没有意义，”一位Biontech发言人被反应。</p><p>  If you were enrolled in Berenson’s vaccine trial for SARS-CoV-2 and never contracted the virus, but one day you told a clinician that you had a bit of a cough, Berenson would mark you down as “infected with COVID-19” and blame the vaccine. That’s the logic here, and, as you can tell, it’s not really logic; it just seems like an attempt to find something—anything—wrong with the vaccines.</p><p>  如果您注册了SARS-COV-2的Berenson的疫苗审判，而且从未收缩过病毒，但有一天您告诉临床医生，您有一点咳嗽，Berenson会将您称为“感染Covid-19”和责备疫苗。这是这里的逻辑，并且，正如你所说，它不是真正的逻辑;它似乎只是试图找到一些东西 - 疫苗是错误的。</p><p> Berenson’s claim: The mRNA vaccines dangerously suppress your immune system, possibly causing severe illness and even death.</p><p> Berenson的索赔：mRNA疫苗危险地抑制了您的免疫系统，可能导致严重疾病甚至死亡。</p><p>  The reality: His claim is based on a total misunderstanding of how the immune system works.</p><p>  现实：他的索赔是基于对免疫系统如何运作的完全误解。</p><p> Berenson wrote in an email that “the first dose of the mRNA vaccine temporarily suppresses the immune system.” He has claimed on  Twitter that the mRNA vaccines “transiently suppress lymphocytes,” or our white blood cells, and suggested that this might lead to “post-vaccination deaths.”</p><p> Berenson在一封电子邮件中写道，“暂时抑制免疫系统的第一剂的mRNA疫苗”。他已声称Twitter，MRNA疫苗“瞬间抑制淋巴细胞，”或我们的白细胞，并建议这可能导致“疫苗接种后死亡。”</p><p> Scientists tore this one to shreds. “The claim he is making is simply fearmongering, connecting a simple physiological event with bogus claims of deaths,” Shane Crotty, a researcher at the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told me. “The observation of lymphocyte numbers temporarily dropping in blood is actually a common phenomenon in immune responses.”</p><p> 科学家撕碎这一个碎片。 “他所做的索赔是简单的可怕的，与虚假宣称的简单的生理活动，”La Jolla免疫学研究所的传染病和疫苗研究中心的研究员告诉我。 “暂时滴血的淋巴细胞数的观察实际上是免疫反应中的常见现象。” </p><p>   A little background is useful here: White blood cells are the immune system’s scouts. After an effective vaccination, some of them leave the blood and go to the site of inflammation, such as the arm that received the shot. “The cells are not gone,” Crotty said. “They come back to the blood in a few days. It is generally a good sign of an immune response, not the opposite.” To demonstrate that the vaccines are counterproductive, then, Berenson is pointing to the very biological mechanism that strongly suggests they’re working just as scientists expected.</p><p>这里有一点背景：白细胞是免疫系统的侦察员。经过有效的疫苗接种后，其中一些人离开血液并转到炎症的部位，例如接收射击的手臂。 “细胞没有消失，”克罗蒂说。 “几天后，他们回到了血液。这通常是免疫反应的良好迹象，而不是相反的迹象。“为了证明疫苗是适得其反的，Berenson指向非常强烈的制定的生物机制，他们正如科学家所预期的那样工作。</p><p>  Readers are surely familiar with other biological events that sound bad in the short term but are part of a normal, healthy process. When you lift weights at the gym, your muscles experience small tears that recover and then strengthen over time. Imagine if some loudmouth started screaming in the middle of the weight room, “You all think you’re building your muscles, but actually you’re tearing them to shreds, and it could kill you!” You would probably carry on calmly, assuming that this guy just got a little overexcited after finding a Yahoo Answers article about muscle formation and stopped reading after the first paragraph. Berenson’s claim is basically a version of that, but for your immune system.</p><p>  读者肯定熟悉其他生物事件，在短期内听起来很糟糕，但是正常健康的过程的一部分。当你在健身房举重时，你的肌肉会经历较小的泪水，然后随着时间的推移加强。想象一下，如果有些响声在重量室中间开始尖叫，“你们都认为你正在建造你的肌肉，但实际上你将它们撕成碎片，它可以杀了你！”假设这家伙在找到关于肌肉形成的肌肉形成并在第一段后停止阅读后，这家伙刚刚过度过度过度过度兴起。 Berenson的索赔基本上是一个版本，但对于你的免疫系统来说。</p><p>  “Actually,” Talaat said, “his argument is even worse than your analogy. Muscles really do tear at the gym. But lymphocytes don’t go away. They just move. What he’s describing as dangerous in these tweets is just the regular functioning of our immune system.”</p><p>  “实际上，”塔拉特说：“他的论点甚至比你的类比更糟糕。肌肉真的在健身房撕裂。但淋巴细胞不会消失。他们只是搬家了。他在这些推文中描述危险的是什么只是我们免疫系统的正常运作。“</p><p> Berenson’s claim: In Israel, the shots are causing a scary number of deaths and hospitalizations.</p><p> Berenson的索赔：在以色列，镜头造成可怕的死亡和住院时间。</p><p>  The reality: Israel is a sensational vaccine success story: a nearly open economy where COVID-19 rates are plunging.  See for yourself!</p><p>  现实：以色列是一个耸人听闻的疫苗成功故事：一个近乎公开的经济，Covid-19率急剧下降。你自己看！</p><p> On February 11, Berenson  warned his followers that early data from Israel proved that vaccine advocates “need to start ratcheting down expectations.” This was a strange claim to make at the time: An Israeli health-care provider had  reported no deaths and four severe cases among its first 523,000 fully vaccinated people. But the claim seems even more ridiculous now, in light of Israel’s incredible success since then. New positive cases in Israel are down  roughly 95 percent since January. Deaths have plunged, even though the economy is  almost fully open.</p><p> 2月11日，Berenson警告他的追随者，来自以色列的早期数据证明，疫苗倡导者“需要开始驾驭贬值。”这是一次奇怪的主张：以色列卫生保健提供者报告了其前523,000人的死亡和四个严重案件。但是，根据以色列从那以来，以色列令人难以置信的成功，索赔似乎更加荒谬。以色列新的积极案例自1月以来跌幅大约为95％。即使经济几乎完全开放，死亡也陷入了困扰。</p><p>  When I asked Berenson to explain his beef with Israel’s vaccine record, he sent  a link to a news story in Hebrew that, he said, reported “several hundred deaths and hospitalizations and thousands of infections in people who have received both doses.” I can’t read Hebrew, so I reached out to someone who can, Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, in Rehovot, Israel. He replied by email: “This link actually shows that the vast majority of those who died were NOT vaccinated.” By Segal’s calculations, the vaccines have reduced the risk of death by more than 90 percent in the Israeli population. Segal also said that “numbers of infections only went down, and even more so among the age groups who were first to vaccinate.”</p><p>  当我让Berenson与以色列的疫苗记录一起解释他的牛肉时，他派出了一条链接到希伯来语中的新闻报道，他说，他说，“已经收到两种剂量的人的几百个死亡和住院和数千人感染。”我无法阅读希伯来语，所以我伸出了一个能够，鄂尔戈尔是魏兹曼科学研究所的计算生物学家的人，在以色列的雷霍夫特。他通过电子邮件回答：“这个链接实际上表明，绝大多数死亡的人没有接种疫苗。”通过SEGAL的计算，疫苗将死亡风险降低到以色列人口超过90％以上。 Segal还表示，“感染数量只是下降，甚至更多的年龄群是第一个接种疫苗的年龄群体中。” </p><p> Berenson is wrong about all sorts of little things when it comes to Israel, but I want to emphasize how straightforward and obvious the big picture is here. Israel is  a world leader in vaccinations. Its COVID-19 cases have plunged, and its economy is roaring back to life.</p><p>Berenson关于以色列各种各样的小事都是错误的，但我想强调大局在这里的直接和明显的方式。以色列是疫苗接种的世界领导者。它的Covid-19案件已经困扰，其经济咆哮着恢复生机。</p><p> The reality: Outside of extremely rare cases, every adult should get a vaccine—and if it’s authorized for children, children should get it too.</p><p> 现实：在极端罕见的情况之外，每个成年人都应该得到疫苗 - 如果它授权儿童，孩子们也应该得到它。</p><p> I wanted to know where Berenson stood on the most important question: Who does he think should get a vaccine, and who does he think shouldn’t? This was the core of his answer:</p><p> 我想知道Berenson在哪里站在最重要的问题上：他认为应该得到疫苗的谁，他认为他不应该？这是他答案的核心：</p><p> For most healthy people under 50—and certainly under 35—the side effects from the shots are likely to be worse than a case of Covid. Over 70, sure. The grey zone is somewhere in the middle and probably depends on personal risk factors.</p><p> 对于50岁以下的最健康的人 - 且肯定在35岁以下 - 射击的副作用可能比Covid的案例更糟糕。超过70，肯定。灰色区域位于中间的某个地方，可能取决于个人风险因素。</p><p> This response has two huge problems. First, although the disease clearly gets more severe with age, drawing a line at 70 is nonsensical. Those in their 50s and early 60s are three times more likely to die from this disease than a 40-something, and  400 times more likely to die than a teenager, according to the CDC.</p><p> 这个回应有两个巨大问题。首先，虽然随着年龄的年龄清楚地变得更加严重，但在70时绘制一条线是荒谬的。根据CDC的说法，他们50岁和60多岁的人死于这种疾病的可能性比40岁的可能性比40岁更可能死了400倍。</p><p>  Second, the suggestion that the vaccine’s side effects are worse than having COVID-19 is ludicrous. The vaccine  can cause chills, fever, and other symptoms in the first few days. That’s just the immune system  doing its job; severe illness from the vaccines is  vanishingly rare. But severe illness in a pandemic is not rare. Based on data from  COVID-NET, a surveillance network that captures hospitalizations across the U.S., hundreds of thousands of people under age 50 have likely gone to the hospital with COVID-19. *   Several  studies have indicated that at least one-third of hospitalized people suffer from long-term symptoms of COVID-19. (Guess what seems to alleviate the symptoms of some of these patients?  Getting vaccinated.)</p><p>  其次，疫苗副作用比具有Covid-19更糟糕的建议是荒谬的。疫苗在最初的几天内会引起寒冷，发烧和其他症状。这只是免疫系统做了工作;来自疫苗的严重疾病越罕见。但大流行的严重疾病并不罕见。根据Covid-Net的数据，一个监视网络，捕获美国，数十万人的住院，50岁以下的人可能会带来与Covid-19的医院。 *几项研究表明，至少三分之一的住院人员患有Covid-19的长期症状。 （猜猜似乎可以缓解这些患者中的一些症状吗？接种疫苗。）</p><p>  The idea that the vaccine is worse than the disease for the under-70 crowd falls apart utterly when we consider the “side effect” of death. Roughly  100,000 people under 65 have died of COVID-19. Meanwhile, out of more than 145 million vaccines administered in the U.S.,  a CDC review of clinical information found no evidence that they had caused any deaths. The current score in the competition between non-senior pandemic deaths and conclusive vaccine deaths is 100,000–0.</p><p>  当我们考虑死亡的“副作用”时，疫苗比70岁的人群的疾病更糟糕的想法。在65岁以下的大约100,000人死于Covid-19。同时，在美国临床信息的CDC审查中，在美国提供了超过1.45亿疫苗，发现没有证据表明他们造成了任何死亡。目前在非高级大流行死亡和决定性疫苗死亡之间的竞争中得分为100,000-0。 </p><p>  One hundred thousand to zero. That might be the most important statistic in this whole mess. Berenson doesn’t tweet blatantly falsifiable statements about the vaccines every day. For the most part, he peddles doubt, laced with confusing and expert-sounding jargon, which may seem compelling at first but can’t survive contact with expert opinion.</p><p>十万到零。这可能是这杂乱中最重要的统计数据。 Berenson每天没有对疫苗发出公然伪造的陈述。在大多数情况下，他兜售疑问，令人疑惑，令人困惑和专业的令人作呕的行话，这可能起初可能引人注目，但不能与专家意见一起恢复联系。</p><p> To be honest, I initially had serious doubts about publishing this piece. The trap of exposing conspiracy theories is obvious: To demonstrate why a theory is wrong, you have to explain it and, in doing so, incur the risk that some people will be convinced by the very theory you’re trying to debunk. But that horse has left the barn. More than half of Republicans under the age of 50 say they  simply won’t get a vaccine. Their hesitancy is being fanned by right-wing hacks, Fox News showboats, and vaccine skeptics like Alex Berenson. The case for the vaccines is built upon a firm foundation of  scientific discovery,  clinical-trial data, and  real-world evidence.
