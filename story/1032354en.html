Now he wants everyone&#39;s voice to be heard.</p><p>凯尔西·海托华是一位自学成才的技术专家，拥有讲故事的嗓音，她挑战了企业技术部门臭名昭著的多样性问题，成为该行业的领军人物之一。现在他希望每个人的声音都能被听到。</p><p>     It was March 2016, and the Kubernetes jamboree, KubeCon, was coming to Idah&#39;s hometown of London for the first time. Hightower, the de facto spokesperson for Kubernetes just as it was emerging as a force in enterprise tech, was speaking at the event.</p><p>那是2016年3月，库伯内斯的盛会KubeCon第一次来到了伊达的家乡伦敦。海托华是Kubernetes的实际发言人，当时Kubernetes正成为企业技术领域的一股力量，他在活动上发表了讲话。</p><p> Idah had watched many of Hightower&#39;s talks and demonstrations on YouTube, as a veteran engineer trying to learn new skills like Puppet and Kubernetes. Now, he wanted his son Jovanni to meet Hightower, to see that Black people like themselves could be leaders in a field that has become the driving force behind the modern economy.</p><p>作为一名经验丰富的工程师，伊达在YouTube上观看了海托华的许多演讲和演示，试图学习木偶和库伯内斯等新技能。现在，他想让他的儿子约万尼见见海托华，让他们看到像他们一样的黑人可以成为这个领域的领导者，这个领域已经成为现代经济背后的驱动力。</p><p>  &#34;What I told him was, the first time I saw his video, it struck a chord in me that just touched me in a way I didn&#39;t expect,&#34; Idah told Protocol. &#34;What was really surprising to me was that I never knew I needed that. Because I was confident; I didn&#39;t know I needed to see somebody who looked like me [leading those discussions].&#34;</p><p>我告诉他的是，当我第一次看到他的视频时，它触动了我的心弦，以一种我意想不到的方式触动了我，伊达告诉礼宾。真正让我吃惊的是，我从来不知道我需要它。因为我很自信；我不知道我需要见一个长得像我的人[领导那些讨论]。</p><p>  Now, Hightower, principal engineer for Google Cloud, is one of the most prominent and respected faces in cloud computing and open-source software. He has been one of the most popular speakers at enterprise tech events for several years, marrying formidable self-taught technical chops to a storyteller&#39;s voice.</p><p>现在，Google Cloud的首席工程师HighTower是云计算和开源软件中最突出和最受尊敬的面孔之一。几年来，他一直是企业技术活动中最受欢迎的演讲者之一，他将令人敬畏的自学技术印章与讲故事的人的声音结合在一起。</p><p> He also stands out as one of the few Black men in enterprise infrastructure tech, a group whose members feel is an even whiter domain within the notoriously homogenous tech industry. For reasons that should be clear, his path to a prominent role in this field has been that much harder.</p><p>他还在企业基础设施技术领域脱颖而出，成为为数不多的黑人男性之一，这个群体的成员认为，在臭名昭著的同质化科技行业中，他们是一个更白的领域。出于应该很清楚的原因，他在这一领域获得突出地位的道路要艰难得多。</p><p>  &#34;He didn&#39;t get there by accident. There&#39;s no way a Black guy got there by accident,&#34; said Bryan Liles, a principal engineer at VMware and a friend of Hightower&#39;s who has also dealt with issues of racism as a Black engineer in the tech industry. &#34;We didn&#39;t grow up near Stanford,&#34; he added, underscoring the role that the exclusive Silicon Valley university played in launching Google and many a tech career.</p><p>他到那里不是偶然的。VMware的首席工程师、HighTower的朋友布莱恩·莱尔斯(Bryan Liles)说，黑人不可能是偶然来到这里的。作为一名科技行业的黑人工程师，莱尔斯也曾处理过种族主义问题。他补充说，我们不是在斯坦福附近长大的，他强调了这所独一无二的硅谷大学在推出谷歌和许多科技职业方面所发挥的作用。</p><p> Hightower, 39, was fairly well-known in and around the Docker and Kubernetes open-source communities as those technologies emerged around the middle of the last decade, but really caught people&#39;s attention with  a talk at a tech conference in May 2017, in which he broke from the usual pattern of highly technical how-to presentations to tell his life story.</p><p>现年39岁的海托华在Docker和Kubernetes开源社区及其周边地区相当出名，因为这些技术在过去十年的中期出现，但他在2017年5月的一次技术会议上的一次演讲真正吸引了人们的注意，他打破了通常的高度技术性演示的模式，讲述了自己的人生故事。</p><p>  His brief encounter a year earlier with Idah, who now works for rising enterprise star HashiCorp, had left quite an impression.</p><p>一年前，他与现在为后起之秀HashiCorp工作的伊达短暂相遇，给人留下了相当深刻的印象。</p><p> &#34;He&#39;s watching YouTube trying to figure out all this new stuff,&#34; Hightower recalled. &#34;And here&#39;s this guy that looks exactly like him. And I know what I&#39;m talking about, and other people say he knows what he&#39;s talking about. And he told his son that he wanted just to show him that not only are we allowed to attend the event, we can lead them.&#34;</p><p>海托华回忆说，他正在看YouTube，试图弄明白所有这些新东西。这就是这个长得跟他一模一样的家伙。我知道我在说什么，其他人也说他知道他在说什么。他告诉他的儿子，他只是想让他知道，我们不仅被允许参加活动，我们还可以领导他们。</p><p>   He spent his early childhood in Long Beach, but his mother decided to move back to family and friends in their hometown of Atlanta following a divorce, right as Hightower was entering high school. Sports had been his obsession up until that point, but he decided he should probably get a job to help out around the house and pay for his own clothes.</p><p>他的童年早期是在长滩度过的，但他的母亲在离婚后决定搬回家乡亚特兰大的家人和朋友那里，就在海托华即将进入高中的时候。在那之前，运动一直是他的痴迷，但他决定，他可能应该找一份工作来帮忙做家务，并支付自己的衣服。</p><p> He began working at McDonald&#39;s, earning $4.15 an hour working nearly 40 hours a week, mostly on the weekends. He was quickly promoted to shift manager at the age of 16, where he had the authority to tell other workers when they could clock out on slow nights, and walked the two miles from his house to the restaurant before every shift.</p><p>他开始在麦当劳工作，每小时挣4.15美元，每周工作近40个小时，大部分在周末。他在16岁时很快被提升为轮班经理，在那里他有权告诉其他员工，他们什么时候可以在清闲的夜晚打卡下班。每次轮班前，他都会从他家步行两英里到餐厅。</p><p> &#34;They had that place working like clockwork,&#34; recalled Ronnie Jordan, a childhood friend. &#34;He figured out how to do stuff way more efficient early.&#34;</p><p>儿时的朋友罗尼·乔丹(Ronnie Jordan)回忆道，他们让那个地方运转得有条不紊。他很早就想出了如何更有效率地做事情。</p><p>   Hightower was also an excellent student. After a brief stint at Clayton State University, where he said the technology classes were more or less glorified Microsoft Word tutorials, he realized he needed a bigger challenge. He enrolled in certification classes sponsored by CompTIA to get his A+ certification, which led to a job as a DSL installation technician for Bell South at the age of 19.</p><p>海托华也是一名优秀的学生。他说，在克莱顿州立大学(Clayton State University)短暂停留了一段时间后，那里的技术课程或多或少地美化了Microsoft Word教程，他意识到自己需要一个更大的挑战。他参加了由CompTIA赞助的认证课程，获得了A+认证，这使他在19岁时获得了贝尔南方公司的一份DSL安装技术员的工作。</p><p> &#34;In my 12th-grade year I said, you know what, maybe this technology thing is a thing, right? You&#39;re looking at the stories of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, they didn&#39;t go to college. You know, the richest man in the world didn&#39;t go to college,&#34; Hightower said.</p><p>在我12年级的时候，我说过，你知道吗，也许科技是一件事，对吧？你现在看到的是比尔·盖茨和史蒂夫·乔布斯的故事，他们没有上过大学。你知道，世界上最富有的人没有上过大学，海托华说。</p><p> It was while working for Bell South in the early 2000s that Hightower had an experience that would shape the rest of his life, a story he told in that pivotal 2017 talk.</p><p>正是在21世纪初为贝尔南方公司工作期间，海托华有一段经历将塑造他的余生，他在2017年那次关键的演讲中讲述了这个故事。</p><p> He was dispatched to a nice neighborhood in Atlanta for a standard DSL installation. When he entered the home, he realized the customer was someone prominent; he was an architect and city planner, with pictures of himself and several U.S. presidents lining the walls of the office where Hightower was installing the internet connection.</p><p>他被派到亚特兰大一个不错的社区去安装标准的DSL。当他走进家时，他意识到顾客是一个知名人士；他是一名建筑师和城市规划师，海托华正在安装互联网连接的办公室的墙上排列着他和几位美国总统的照片。</p><p> The customer shocked Hightower by declaring right away that a Black person had never stepped foot inside his house. &#34;But you&#39;re the only person that can give me this technology right now,&#34; he remembered the man saying, &#34;so I&#39;m going to put all that aside, because you have something that I don&#39;t.&#34;</p><p>这位顾客当即宣布从未有黑人踏进过他的房子，这让海托华感到震惊。但你是现在唯一能给我这项技术的人，他记得那个人说过，所以我要把这一切放在一边，因为你有一些我没有的东西。</p><p>  &#34;And at that point, it kind of clicked for me: This particular skill set was my Superman suit,&#34; Hightower said. &#34;When I&#39;m wearing the collared shirt with the tool bag, people will respect me for my talents and look past the other stuff. I kind of knew at that point that technology was this super empowering, leveling-the-playing-field skill that I could do.&#34;</p><p>在这一点上，我有点想通了：这套特殊的技能就是我的超人套装，海托华说。当我穿着带工具袋的有领衬衫时，人们会因为我的才华而尊重我，而忽略了其他的东西。在这一点上，我多少知道，技术是一种我能做到的超级赋权、公平竞争的技能。</p><p>  After working as an independent contractor for Bell South for a few years in the early 2000s, Hightower realized that he was pretty good at this job. Customers began asking him for assistance that went beyond the scope of the usual technician&#39;s role, like setting up a network for a small business.</p><p>在本世纪初，海托华作为贝尔南方公司的独立承包商工作了几年后，他意识到自己非常擅长这份工作。客户开始要求他提供超出通常技术员职责范围的帮助，比如为一家小企业建立网络。</p><p> And at a certain point it dawned on him that he could probably make more money working for himself. In his early 20s, he started a solo practice as an IT consultant, eventually hiring others to work for him and opening up a store in Jonesboro, Georgia.</p><p>在某种程度上，他突然意识到，他可能会为自己工作赚更多的钱。在他20岁出头的时候，他开始了自己的IT顾问业务，最终雇佣了其他人为他工作，并在佐治亚州琼斯伯勒开了一家商店。</p><p> Indeed, if there&#39;s a word to characterize this stage of Hightower&#39;s career, it&#39;s &#34;hustle.&#34; After running his own business for a few years, he actually briefly took a low-level tech job at Google and later the Georgia-based financial software company Total Systems (now named TSYS and owned by Global Payments).</p><p>事实上，如果用一个词来形容HighTower职业生涯的这一阶段，那就是在经营自己的企业几年后，他实际上短暂地在谷歌(Google)以及后来的佐治亚州金融软件公司道达尔系统(Total Systems)(现在名为TSYS，由Global Payments所有)担任了一份低级别的技术工作。</p><p> And alongside those roles, for several years he also dabbled with a gig that taught him a lot about being onstage, dealing with pressure and the importance of getting paid.</p><p>除了这些角色，几年来他还涉足了一场演唱会，教会了他很多关于在舞台上、处理压力和赚钱的重要性的知识。</p><p>    Ronnie Jordan was getting some attention in the local Atlanta open-mic comedy scene when he and Hightower realized he might actually have a future making people laugh. The two began to work closely together on an act, and Hightower — the only person Jordan knew with a reliable car — started driving him around to different gigs around town.</p><p>罗尼·乔丹(Ronnie Jordan)在当地亚特兰大的开放麦克风喜剧场景中获得了一些关注，这时他和海托华意识到，他可能真的有一个让人发笑的未来。两人开始密切合作，开始一起表演，海托华-乔丹认识的唯一有一辆可靠汽车的人-开始开车带他去镇上不同的演唱会。</p><p> When Hightower realized that not only could Jordan slay the crowds at the  Uptown Comedy Corner — arguably one of the most influential Black comedy clubs in the South at that time — but that he could also make people howl with laughter at Jillian&#39;s, the suburban Dave-and-Buster&#39;s-like attraction favored by white people, he knew Jordan had potential.</p><p>当海托华意识到乔丹不仅可以在住宅区喜剧角(可以说是当时南方最有影响力的黑人喜剧俱乐部之一)驱散人群，而且他还可以让人们在吉利安(Jillian&#39；s)大笑起来，这是一个类似于戴夫与巴斯特(Dave&Buster)的郊区景点，受到白人的青睐，他知道乔丹有潜力。</p><p> He set up a studio where Jordan could practice his act. He filmed that act and posted it on the web, at a time when very few people understood the potential the web would have to launch entertainment careers. And he encouraged Jordan to try out for an &#34;American Idol&#34;-style comedy show produced by the team behind the &#34;Kings of Comedy&#34; series in 2004.</p><p>他设立了一个工作室，乔丹可以在那里练习他的表演。他拍摄了这一行为并将其发布在网络上，当时几乎没有人理解网络将不得不启动娱乐业的潜力。他还鼓励乔丹试演一个美国偶像风格的喜剧节目，该节目由喜剧之王系列的幕后团队于2004年制作。</p><p> Jordan wound up making the finals and performing before 35,000 people at New York&#39;s Madison Square Garden. He won among strong competition and got $35,000 — minus Hightower&#39;s management fee, of course.</p><p>乔丹最终进入决赛，并在纽约麦迪逊广场花园35000人面前表演。他在激烈的竞争中获胜，获得3.5万美元-当然，减去HighTower的管理费。</p><p>  As a result of his performance, Jordan received offers from other acts to open at shows across the country, but he still only knew one guy with a reliable car. Hightower and Jordan drove across the country from gig to gig in a Chevy Suburban, and even during those long trips, Hightower found time to learn more about his budding career in computer science.</p><p>由于他的表演，乔丹收到了其他艺人的邀请，希望在全国各地的演出中开幕，但他仍然只认识一个人，有一辆可靠的车。海托华和乔丹开着雪佛兰郊区的一场又一场的演出横穿全国，即使在那些长途旅行中，海托华也抽出时间更多地了解了他在计算机科学领域萌芽中的职业生涯。</p><p> &#34;He was always stopping at a Barnes and Noble&#34; to pick up some new certification book for a nascent technology, said Jordan, who  continues to practice comedy during a pandemic that has curtailed opportunities for performers of all kinds. &#34;He would read a whole book in one night.&#34;</p><p>乔丹说，他总是在巴诺书店(Barnes&Noble)停下来，为一项新兴技术拿到一些新的认证证书。在一场流行病减少了各种表演者的机会期间，乔丹继续从事喜剧业务。他能在一个晚上读完一整本书。</p><p>  &#34;In the entertainment business, you get paid based on perception,&#34; he said. &#34;And I think that&#39;s what I learned; it&#39;s not about the job, it&#39;s about what I bring to the job.&#34;</p><p>他说：在娱乐业，你的报酬取决于你的观感。我想这就是我所学到的；这不是关于工作，而是关于我给工作带来了什么。</p><p>  Meanwhile, Hightower was starting to get noticed in the Atlanta open-source community thanks to a series of talks at Python meetups when he caught the attention of James Turnbull, an engineering manager for infrastructure management pioneer Puppet Labs.</p><p>与此同时，HighTower开始在亚特兰大开源社区引起人们的注意，这要归功于Python Meetups上的一系列演讲，当时他引起了基础设施管理先驱Puppet Labs的工程经理詹姆斯·特恩布尔(James Turnbull)的注意。</p><p> Turnbull was struck by the way Hightower and his colleagues at Total Systems were using Puppet, Python and some good old-fashioned hacking to transform how Total Systems deployed software changes to its servers.</p><p>特恩布尔对海托尔和他在道达尔系统公司的同事使用木偶、Python和一些优秀的老式黑客来改变道达尔系统公司在其服务器上部署软件更改的方式感到震惊。</p><p> &#34;This was real shadow IT,&#34; said Elson Rodriguez, a colleague of Hightower&#39;s at Total Systems and longtime friend. The financial services company still relied on mainframes and required employees to work overnight to deploy changes manually out of a Word document, which didn&#39;t sit right with Hightower and Rodriguez. So they worked together after hours to automate the deployment of those changes, and, despite internal obstacles and Rodriguez&#39;s (by his own admission, at the time) overly headstrong attitude, eventually saved the company countless hours each time new software rolled out.</p><p>这是真正的影子IT，埃尔森·罗德里格斯(Elson Rodriguez)说，他是HighTower‘s在道达尔系统公司(Total Systems)的同事，也是他的老朋友。这家金融服务公司仍然依赖大型机，并要求员工通宵工作，以手动部署Word文档中的更改，这与HighTower和Rodriguez并非如此。因此，他们在下班后一起工作，自动部署这些变化，尽管内部存在障碍，罗德里格斯(罗德里格斯自己当时承认)过于固执的态度，最终在每次推出新软件时都为公司节省了无数个小时。</p><p>  &#34;His optimism is just crazy,&#34; Rodriguez said. &#34;He&#39;s lucky, because some people are optimistic and don&#39;t have the energy to see it through and process those lessons. He talks some crazy stuff, and tries some crazy stuff, and doesn&#39;t get too upset when it doesn&#39;t work out, he just draws a lesson from it and moves on.&#34;</p><p>罗德里格斯说，他的乐观简直是疯了。他是幸运的，因为有些人很乐观，没有精力去看到底，没有精力去接受这些教训。他会说一些疯狂的事情，也会尝试一些疯狂的事情，当事情没有解决时，他不会太沮丧，他只是从中吸取教训，然后继续前进。</p><p> Hightower was invited out to Puppet&#39;s headquarters in Portland, Oregon, to give a talk during the company&#39;s annual developer event in front of the whole company, including founder and CEO Luke Kanies. Puppet wound up offering Hightower, at the time a systems administrator, a job as a customer-facing software engineer.</p><p>海托华应邀来到位于俄勒冈州波特兰的木偶公司总部，在该公司一年一度的开发者活动期间，在包括创始人兼首席执行官卢克·凯尼斯在内的全公司面前发表演讲。木偶最终为当时的系统管理员HighTower提供了一份面向客户的软件工程师的工作。</p><p> &#34;My guess is we can&#39;t name anybody else we hired in that same position,&#34; Kanies told Protocol. &#34;He was great with people, but he was so much greater at talking about things,&#34; or explaining how customers could use Puppet&#39;s technology to solve their problems, he said.</p><p>我的猜测是，我们不能说出我们雇佣的其他同一职位的人的名字，凯尼斯告诉礼宾。他很善于与人打交道，但他更善于谈论事情，或者解释客户如何使用木偶的技术来解决他们的问题，他说。</p><p>   After a few months of working remotely from Atlanta in 2013, Hightower made the cross-country move to Portland, a place about as geographically, culturally and racially removed from Atlanta as you can get in the U.S. It was early in his Portland days when Hightower got a reminder of what it was like to be the only Black man in a very white tech company.</p><p>2013年，在亚特兰大远程工作了几个月后，海托华搬到了波特兰，这个地方在地理上、文化上和种族上都和美国的亚特兰大相去甚远。海托华在波特兰的日子还早些时候，就有人提醒他，作为一家非常白人的科技公司里唯一的黑人男性是什么感觉。</p><p> At the time Puppet decided to build a digital hub called The Forge, where employees, customers and open-source contributors could share packages of Puppet code. As part of his transition from system administrator to software developer, Hightower wound up as the leader of the team responsible for this effort.</p><p>当时，木偶决定建立一个名为“锻造”(Forge)的数字中心，员工、客户和开源贡献者可以在这里共享木偶代码包。作为从系统管理员到软件开发人员过渡的一部分，HighTower最终成为负责这项工作的团队的负责人。</p><p> Individual teams at Puppet would give themselves funny or clever names; the team working on migrating Puppet to Windows was called &#34;For the Win,&#34; as an example. One senior Puppet executive suggested that the team Hightower led should be named &#34;Geordi La Forge.&#34;</p><p>木偶的个别团队会给自己起有趣或聪明的名字；例如，致力于将木偶迁移到Windows的团队因获胜而被称为。一位木偶高级管理人员建议，海托华领导的团队应该命名为Geordi La Forge。</p><p>  If you&#39;re unfamiliar with that name, as Hightower was at the time, know that  Geordi La Forge was the only Black member of the crew of the Enterprise in &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&#34; a late 1980s television series that was incredibly popular with white Generation X tech workers.</p><p>如果你不熟悉这个名字，就像海托华当时的名字一样，你应该知道，在20世纪80年代末的电视连续剧“星际迷航：下一代”(Star Trek：The Next Generation)中，Geordi La Forge是企业号剧组中唯一的黑人成员，这部电视剧在X世代白人科技工作者中非常受欢迎。</p><p> &#34;I actually go to my desktop, and I start searching for his name and it&#39;s, like, wait a minute! This is the only Black engineer on &#39;Star Trek&#39;! Like, how did y&#39;all pick that name for my team?&#34; Hightower remembered, laughing as he did. At the time he took it in stride, even changing his Twitter profile picture to a picture of the character to tweak his new colleagues, making them initially nervous that they had offended him.</p><p>我实际上去了我的桌面，我开始搜索他的名字，它就像，等一下！这是“星际迷航”中唯一的黑人工程师！比如，你们是怎么给我的团队起这个名字的？海托华一边笑着回忆着。当时他泰然处之，甚至将他在推特上的头像改为这个人物的照片，以调整他的新同事，让他们最初感到紧张，因为他们冒犯了他。</p><p>  Both Hightower and Kanies recalled the story with humor, and it doesn&#39;t appear that there was any ill will on the part of the executive who suggested the name. But the term &#34;microagression&#34; was not as widely understood eight or so years ago, Kanies allowed.</p><p>海托华和凯尼斯回忆起这个故事时都很幽默，而且这个名字的提出者似乎没有任何恶意。但是，凯尼斯承认，大约八年前，“微进动”这个词还没有被广泛理解。</p><p> &#34;If you&#39;d gone back to me at that time, I&#39;d say I was much less aware of the struggles in general,&#34; Kanies said.</p><p>凯尼斯说：如果你当时回到我身边，我会说我对总体上的挣扎知之甚少。</p><p>  Hightower is grateful for his time at Puppet, which introduced him to a much wider tech audience, got him involved more closely with the open-source community, and started him down the path toward becoming one of the more sought-after speakers on the cloud circuit.</p><p>HighTower感谢他在Puppet的时间，这将他介绍给了更广泛的技术观众，让他更密切地参与了开源社区，并开始了他成为云巡回演讲者中更受欢迎的演讲者之一的道路。</p><p> But around 2014, he realized that Puppet&#39;s main business at the time — selling configuration management software to companies running their own data centers — was about to be transformed by two breakthroughs in infrastructure technology: the Go programming language and Docker containers.</p><p>但在2014年左右，他意识到，Puppet当时的主要业务-向运营自己数据中心的公司销售配置管理软件-即将因基础设施技术的两项突破而发生转变：Go编程语言和Docker Containers。</p><p> Back at Google, the company had been refining Go as a modern update to the concepts behind C++, one of the most widely used infrastructure languages at that time. Like  Rust, another programming language developed around this time, Go simplified some tasks and made it harder for programmers to make memory-handling mistakes that cause security holes.</p><p>回到谷歌，该公司一直在改进围棋，将其作为当时使用最广泛的基础设施语言之一C++背后的概念的现代更新。像Rust，另一种大约在这个时候开发的编程语言，Go简化了一些任务，使程序员更难犯导致安全漏洞的内存处理错误。</p><p>  Containers have been part of Unix and Linux for a long time, allowing developers to turn applications into portable packages for faster, easier deployment across different types of servers, both in-house and on the cloud. However, in 2013, Docker introduced a user-friendly way to take advantage of container technology, and demand exploded: Docker containers became one of the  fastest-adopted new enterprise technologies in memory, and,  while the company has struggled, the technology underpins the modern &#34;cloud native&#34; movement.</p><p>长期以来，容器一直是Unix和Linux的一部分，允许开发人员将应用程序转换为可移植的软件包，以便更快、更容易地跨不同类型的服务器(包括内部服务器和云服务器)进行部署。然而，在2013年，Docker引入了一种用户友好的方式来利用容器技术，需求呈爆炸式增长：Docker Containers成为记忆中采用最快的新企业技术之一，尽管该公司一直举步维艰，但这项技术支撑着现代的原生云运动。</p><p> Hightower was fascinated by the concept from the moment he heard about it. &#34;What if we changed the abstractions to be less about Linux and various programming languages to this thing called containers? That really piqued my interest,&#34; Hightower said. &#34;I knew that I wanted to head in that particular direction.&#34;</p><p>海托华从听到这个概念的那一刻起就被它迷住了。如果我们把抽象改为更少关于Linux和各种编程语言，改成称为容器的东西，会怎么样？这确实激起了我的兴趣，海托华说。我知道我想朝那个特定的方向前进。</p><p>  After a brief stint at a Portland startup called Monsoon Commerce where he wrote his first open-source project, a configuration management tool called  Confd, he joined another startup called CoreOS in early 2014. CoreOS developed a rival container format to Docker&#39;s and wound up becoming a key contributor to Kubernetes, the open-source container-management project born out of Google that would change Hightower&#39;s life.</p><p>在波特兰一家名为季风商业的初创公司短暂工作后，他编写了他的第一个开源项目，一个名为ConfD的配置管理工具，2014年初，他加入了另一家名为CoreOS的初创公司。CoreOS开发了与Docker竞争的容器格式，并最终成为Kubernetes的关键贡献者，Kubernetes是一个诞生于谷歌的开源容器管理项目，将改变HighTower的生活。</p><p> &#34;I wasn&#39;t a founder of CoreOS, but I played a role that became very instrumental to the company&#39;s success,&#34; Hightower said. &#34;I think that kind of cemented me as an individual, my ability to make change no matter the environment.&#34;</p><p>海托华说：我不是CoreOS的创始人，但我扮演的角色对公司的成功起到了非常重要的作用。我认为这在某种程度上巩固了我作为一个人的能力，无论环境如何，我都有能力做出改变。</p><p>  Hightower stayed at CoreOS for a little over two years (the company was later acquired in 2018 by IBM for $250 million), learning what it took to run an enterprise technology business.</p><p>HighTower在CoreOS呆了两年多一点(该公司后来在2018年被IBM以2.5亿美元收购)，学习了运营企业技术业务所需的条件。</p><p> During that time, Hightower embraced Kubernetes, traveling the world speaking at developer conferences large and small evangelizing this project.  Outside of co-founders Joe Beda, Brendan Burns and Craig McLuckie, he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces of the project, which was quickly gaining converts as the best way to manage large clusters of containers at scale.</p><p>在那段时间里，HighTower拥抱了Kubernetes，周游世界，在大大小小的开发者大会上发表演讲，宣传这个项目。除了联合创始人乔·贝达(Joe Beda)、布兰登·伯恩斯(Brendan Burns)和克雷格·麦卢基(Craig McLuckie)之外，他很快成为该项目最知名的面孔之一，该项目很快就获得了皈依者，认为这是大规模管理大型集装箱集群的最佳方式。</p><p> Hightower wound up collaborating with Beda and Burns on a book called &#34; Kubernetes Up and Running,&#34; which was published in 2017 and introduced him to a wider technical audience, setting the stage for Kubernetes to become one of the most influential open-source projects of the container era and a key building block for modern tech infrastructure.</p><p>HighTower最终与Beda和Burns合作出版了一本名为Kubernetes Up and Running的书，这本书于2017年出版，将他介绍给更广泛的技术受众，为Kubernetes成为集装箱时代最有影响力的开源项目之一和现代科技基础设施的关键构件奠定了基础。</p><p> &#34;The whole Kubernetes and cloud-native journey has been full of an amazing amount of drama, it&#39;s tested all of us,&#34; said Beda, now a principal engineer at VMware who happened to be standing next to Hightower in London when he encountered Idah. &#34;And through all of this, I&#39;ve been incredibly impressed with Kelsey rising above it and really consistently being a stand-up person.&#34;</p><p>贝达说，整个库伯内斯和云计算的旅程充满了惊人的戏剧性，它考验了我们所有人。贝达现在是VMware的首席工程师，当他在伦敦遇到伊达时，他碰巧站在HighTower旁边。在所有这一切中，凯尔西超越了它，一直是一个直言不讳的人，这给我留下了难以置信的印象。</p><p>  At first Hightower wasn&#39;t entirely sure about joining Google, despite entreaties from some prominent members of the Kubernetes community. The project originated at Google, but it grew quickly as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, created in August 2015 by Google and other partners as a subset of  the Linux Foundation.</p><p>起初，海托华并不完全确定是否要加入谷歌，尽管库伯内斯社区的一些著名成员恳求他加入谷歌。该项目起源于谷歌，但作为云本地计算基金会(Cloud Native Computing Foundation)的一部分，它发展迅速。云本地计算基金会由谷歌和其他合作伙伴于2015年8月创建，是Linux基金会的一个子集。</p><p>  In 2015, he was in talks with members of NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California involving a possible role there, and he hesitated about joining Google because of &#34;the fear of being put in a box. I had never met any company that could afford to let someone be who they were outside of a HR, well-defined job definition,&#34; he said.</p><p>2015年，他与美国国家航空航天局(NASA)位于南加州的喷气推进实验室(Jet Propusion Laboratory)的成员就可能在那里担任的职位进行了谈判，由于担心被关进盒子里，他对加入谷歌犹豫不决。他说：我从来没有遇到过任何一家公司，能够让一个人在人力资源、定义明确的工作定义之外做他们自己。</p><p> Hightower actually rejected Google three times, but as he would come to learn, Google, of course, can afford lots of things.</p><p>海托华实际上拒绝了谷歌三次，但正如他后来了解到的那样，谷歌当然可以买得起很多东西。</p><p> &#34;Google just had such a competitive story, long term,&#34; he said. &#34;I talked to the NASA team, and they said, &#39;Look, Kelsey, it&#39;s going to take us 10 years to get to Mars, probably longer. Go to Google. If it doesn&#39;t work, we&#39;ll be happy to have you here at NASA.&#39;&#34;</p><p>他说，谷歌刚刚经历了一个竞争激烈的故事，是长期的。我和美国宇航局的团队谈过，他们说，凯尔西，我们要花10年时间才能到达火星，可能更久。去谷歌看看。如果它不起作用，我们将很高兴你来到美国宇航局。</p><p> Hightower officially joined Google in November 2015, and five years later, it&#39;s working out pretty well for both parties.</p><p>海托华于2015年11月正式加入谷歌，五年后，它对双方都非常有利。</p><p> The company, which built some of the most impressive distributing computing architecture in the world during its rise to prominence, has  struggled to empathize with the average cloud buyer, who doesn&#39;t need to do things Google&#39;s way. Along with serious technical skills, Hightower brought a more human touch to the developer relations role that all cloud vendors employ in an effort to get rank-and-file engineers excited about their services. Now, he spends most of his time talking to customers, figuring out what they really need from their cloud provider, and bringing those insights back to the product development team to improve Google&#39;s services.</p><p>这家公司在崛起期间建造了一些世界上最令人印象深刻的分布式计算架构，但它一直难以与普通云计算买家产生共鸣，因为他们不需要按照谷歌的方式行事。伴随着严肃的技术技能，HighTower为所有云供应商雇佣的开发者关系角色带来了更人性化的触觉，以努力让普通工程师对他们的服务感到兴奋。现在，他的大部分时间都花在与客户交谈，弄清楚他们真正需要从云提供商那里得到什么，并将这些见解带回产品开发团队，以改善谷歌的服务。</p><p>   Eric Brewer, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley and vice president of infrastructure at Google, says that Hightower&#39;s approach is &#34;super authentic,&#34; which surely helps. &#34;One thing Kelsey and I share is that we are not leading by authority,&#34; Brewer added. &#34;I have no direct reports, he has no direct reports; we are leading by influence, and that is a difficult skill to develop.&#34;</p><p>加州大学伯克利分校(University Of California At Berkeley)教授、谷歌(Google)基础设施副总裁埃里克·布鲁尔(Eric Brewer)表示，HighTower的做法是超级真实的，这肯定会有所帮助。布鲁尔补充说：“凯尔西和我有一个共同点，那就是我们不是靠权威来领导的。”我没有直接下属，他也没有直接下属；我们靠影响力领导，这是一项很难培养的技能。</p><p> That&#39;s especially difficult inside a company like Google, which has world-class talent working on some of the industry&#39;s most difficult problems.</p><p>在谷歌这样的公司里，这尤其困难，因为它拥有世界级的人才在解决该行业一些最棘手的问题。</p><p> &#34;In college football, you&#39;ve got the Heisman winners, but when you go to the NFL, you&#39;re a rookie all over again. When you go to Google, just the sheer amount of experience they have with large problems, you have to work hard to be creative,&#34; Hightower said.</p><p>在大学橄榄球比赛中，你有海斯曼获胜者，但当你去NFL时，你又是一个新秀。海托华说，当你去谷歌时，仅仅是他们在处理大问题方面的丰富经验，你就必须努力工作才能有创意。</p><p> Hightower has also played a prominent role in the</p><p>海托华也在。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.protocol.com/kelsey-hightower-google-cloud">https://www.protocol.com/kelsey-hightower-google-cloud</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mcdonald/">#mcdonald</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/海托华/">#海托华</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032205.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_2aeb48d1061bf4c3ddce6c40e22f6ac2.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032205.html">谷歌的人工智能将网页转换为视频</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-30 9:14</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032191.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_3ae57e7e0a2a058628a6c059f958b284.png" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032191.html">使用Google One的新VPN提供更多在线保护</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-30 8:12</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032169.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_ba5ba14271694d9038173b7d9d5f0b44.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032169.html">
