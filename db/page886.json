"note_en": "Mocking your SQL database in Go tests has never been easier. The copyist libraryautomatically records low-level SQL calls made during your tests. It thengenerates test code that can play back those calls without connecting to thereal SQL database. Run your tests again. This time, they&#39;ll run much faster,because now they do not require a database connection.\n Best of all, your tests will run as if your test database was reset to a clean,well-known state between every test case. Gone are the frustrating problemswhere a test runs fine in isolation, but fails when run in concert with othertests that modify the database.\n copyist imposes no overhead on production code, and it requires almost nochanges to your application or testing code, as long as that code directly orindirectly uses Go&#39;s  sql package (e.g. Go ORM&#39;s and the widely used  sqlxpackage). This is because copyist runs at the driver level of Go&#39;s  sqlpackage.\n  Imagine you have some application code that opens a connection to a Postgresdatabase and queries some customer data:\n func QueryName(db *sql.DB) string {\trows, _ := db.Query(&#34;SELECT name FROM customers WHERE id=$1&#34;, 100)\tdefer rows.Close()\tfor rows.Next() {\t\tvar name string\t\trows.Scan(&amp;name)\t\treturn name\t}\treturn &#34;&#34;}\n The customary way to test this code would be to create a test database andpopulate it with test customer data. However, what if application code modifiesrows in the database, like removing customers? If the above code runs on amodified database, it may not return the expected customer. Therefore, it&#39;simportant to reset the state of the database between test cases so that testsbehave predictably. But connecting to a database is slow. Running queries isslow. And resetting the state of an entire database between every test is really slow.\n Various mocking libraries are another alternative to using a test database.These libraries intercept calls at some layer of the application or data accessstack, and return canned responses without needing to touch the database. Theproblem with many of these libraries is that they require the developer tomanually construct the canned responses, which is time-consuming and fragilewhen application changes occur.\n  copyist includes a Go  sql package driver that records the low-level SQL callsmade by application and test code. When a Go test using copyist is invoked withthe &#34;-record&#34; command-line flag, then the copyist driver will record all SQLcalls. When the test completes, copyist will generate playback Go code in acompanion test file. The Go test can then be run again without the &#34;-record&#34;flag. This time the copyist driver will play back the recorded calls, withoutneeding to access the database. The Go test is none the wiser, and runs as if itwas using the database.\n  Below is the recommended test pattern for using copyist. The example shows howto unit test the  QueryName function shown above.\n func TestMain(m *testing.M) {\tflag.Parse()\tcopyist.Register(&#34;postgres&#34;, resetDB)\tos.Exit(m.Run())}func TestQueryName(t *testing.T) {\tdefer copyist.Open().Close()\tdb, _ := sql.Open(&#34;copyist_postgres&#34;, &#34;postgresql://root@localhost&#34;)\tdefer db.Close()\tname := QueryName(db)\tif name != &#34;Andy&#34; {\t\tt.Error(&#34;failed test&#34;)\t}}\n In your  TestMain function (or any other place that gets called before any ofthe tests), call the  copyist.Register function. This function registers a newdriver with Go&#39;s  sql package with the name  copyist_&lt;driverName&gt;. In anytests you&#39;d like to record, add a  defer copyist.Open().Close() statement.This statement begins a new recording session, and then generates playback codewhen  Close is called at the end of the test.\n copyist does need to know whether to run in &#34;recording&#34; mode or &#34;playback&#34; mode.To make copyist run in &#34;recording&#34; mode, invoke the test with the  record flag:\n  This will generate a new test file in the same directory as the  TestQueryNamefile. For example, if that file is called  app_test.go, then copyist willgenerate an  app_copyist_test.go file containing the recording for the TestQueryName test. Now try running the test a couple more times (the firsttime requires a recompile of the test, so will take longer):\n    The above section glossed over an important detail. When registering a driverfor use with copyist, the second argument to  Register is a callback function:\n  If non-nil, this function will be called by copyist each time you call copyist.Open (typically at the beginning of each test), as long as copyist isrunning in &#34;recording&#34; mode. This reset function can do anything it likes, butusually it will run a SQL script against the database in order to reset it to aclean state, by dropping/creating tables, deleting data from table, and/orinserting &#34;fixture&#34; data into tables that makes testing more convenient.\n   This just means that you need to re-run your tests with the &#34;-record&#34; commandline flag, in order to generate new recordings. Most likely, you changed eitheryour application or your test code so that they call the database differently,using a different sequence or content of calls.\n However, there are rarer cases where you&#39;ve regenerated recordings, have made notest or application changes, and yet are still seeing this error when you runyour tests in different orders. This is caused by non-determinism in either yourapplication or in the ORM you&#39;re using.\n As an example of non-determinism, some ORMs send a setup query to the databasewhen the first connection is opened in order to determine the database version.So whichever test happens to run first records an extra Query call. If you runa different test first, you&#39;ll see the &#34;unexpected call&#34; error, since othertests aren&#39;t expecting the extra call.\n The solution to these problems is to eliminate the non-determinism. For example,in the case of an ORM sending a setup query, initialize it from your  TestMainmethod:\n    The size of the test files is directly related to the number of accesses yourtests make to the database, as well as the amount of data that they request.While copyist takes pains to generate efficient code that eliminates as muchredundancy as possible, there&#39;s only so much it can do. Try to write tests thatoperate over smaller amounts of interesting data. For tests that require largenumbers of database calls, or large amounts of data, use a different form ofverification. One nice thing about copyist is that you can pick and choosewhich tests will use it. The right tool for the right job, and all that.\n  Because of the way copyist works, it can only be used with non-parallel,single-threaded tests and application code. This is because the driver code hasno way of knowing which connections, statements, and transactions are used bywhich test and/or by which thread.\n copyist currently supports only the Postgres  pq driver. If you&#39;d like toextend copyist to support other drivers, like MySql or SQLite, you&#39;re invited tosubmit a pull request.\n copyist does not implement every  sql package driver interface and method.

"note_en": "Sometimes, there\u2019s more to a lava flow than meets the eye. Beneath a fresh, sterile, and steaming hot surface, molten rock can still be chewing its way into the ground, carving caves that can stretch dozens of kilometers. On Earth, such lava tubes (once cooled) are a challenge for spelunkers. On the moon and Mars, these features are piquing the interest of planetary geologists, astrobiologists, and explorers.\n  Besides providing a window into geological history, lava tubes offer environmental conditions that are relatively stable and likely to be more hospitable than those found on a planet\u2019s surface. This may make the tubes appealing to life-forms of all sizes, from microbes to spacefaring colonists from Earth.\n If Mars ever hosted life, it may have moved into such refugia as the planet evolved and surface conditions became increasingly harsh. Indeed, some researchers suggest that microbial life may yet hang on in the Red Planet\u2019s underground havens. \u201cOn Mars and other places, lava tubes have the potential to have made the difference between life and death,\u201d says Pascal Lee, a planetary researcher at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, CA.\n Wherever lava tubes are found, they\u2019ll be scientifically exotic, says Lee. And if a mission to another world is designed to explore such an underground feature as well as the surface, \u201cit\u2019ll be like getting two planets for the price of one,\u201d he notes.\n Lava tubes can form almost anywhere molten rock streams from the ground. Steady flows of low-viscosity lava are the most likely to form lava tubes. They can form in a way akin to how rivers ice over during a cold spell. As flowing lava loses heat to the overlying air, its surface cools and solidifies\u2014but it does so more quickly at the edges of the flow, where material moves slowly. Eventually, the molten flow freezes over from shore to shore, which insulates the underlying lava by robbing it of the ability to directly radiate heat upward or be cooled by winds, he explains. Then, when the source of lava begins to wane or as the molten flow chews or melts its way into the underlying rocks, or both, lava drains from the conduit and leaves behind a smooth-sided, steep-walled cavern.\n Lava flows can melt their way into underlying rocks. If the flow is fast and turbulent, lava can erode downward as much as 1 meter each day, according to Alan Whittington, a geologist at University of Texas San Antonio, speaking at the Third International Planetary Caves Conference in San Antonio, TX, in February ( 1). So the tubes created by voluminous and long-lived flows can be huge. The longest known lava tube on Earth\u201465-kilometer-long Kazumura Cave, on the Big Island of Hawaii\u2014stretches almost to the sea from the Kilauea volcano. In some spots, the tube measures 21 meters wide and 18 meters tall ( 2)\u2014a profile big enough to hold a good-sized house.\n But lava tubes on the moon and Mars are almost certainly bigger. Most of these features likely date from 3 to 4 billion years ago, when both bodies had frequent volcanic activity. Grooved features known as sinuous rilles have long been suspected to be collapsed lava tubes; and more recently, stronger evidence has emerged. Images snapped by orbiting probes show openings into underground voids. Often referred to as skylights, these openings probably formed when the roofs of lava tubes fell in. The first such feature on the moon\u2014a hole 50 meters across and dozens of meters deep\u2014was discovered more than a decade ago in an image captured by Japan\u2019s SELENE orbiter ( 3). Many more skylights have been found on the moon since then, and hundreds of possible skylights have been spotted on images snapped by Mars orbiters, the first of which were taken in the mid-1970s ( 4).\n Earth\u2019s lava tubes range in age from a few years old, such as those on the slopes of Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano, to a few hundred thousand years or more. The freshest tubes have yet to be mapped, but in some areas they\u2019re known to stretch dozens of kilometers. In California\u2019s Lava Beds National Monument, for example, more than 800 lava tubes together extend at least 350 kilometers.\n Researchers have for decades speculated that lava tubes on the moon and elsewhere could offer prime space for setting up living quarters for colonists ( 5). The tubes are appealing for many reasons, as Laura Kerber, a geologist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, explained at the caves conference ( 6). First, the environment is protected from radiation such as cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and ultraviolet light. Second, the rock roof would be a shield against micrometeorites that could otherwise puncture spacesuits and buildings. And as on Earth, the underground environment would be buffered from temperature swings. On the moon, those variations are extreme. Data gathered by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter between 2009 and 2013 reveal that temperatures near the lunar equator can reach 120 \u00b0C in the daytime and plunge to \u2013130 \u00b0C during the two-week-long night.\n Whether colonists could actually take advantage of those benefits is another question. Considering the likely instability of material around the edges of skylights, as well as the limited mobility of existing spacesuits, it would be a big challenge to lower people into a hole in the ground and then get them back out, says Whittington. Then there\u2019s the question of whether lava tubes are safe, says NASA\u2019s Lee. Despite what he describes as the romantic idea of making a home in these features, \u201cthe truth about caves is that they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he says. That\u2019s especially likely to be true near skylights, where the roof has already demonstrated the propensity to collapse. Human activity could well destabilize them even further, or cause avalanches of material around the edges of the skylights. \u201cLava tubes may be exciting to explore but not that safe to live in,\u201d Lee says.\n Whether or not lava tubes provide homes for pioneering lunar colonists, they\u2019ll provide plenty of opportunities for geological research. As Charity Phillips-Lander, an astrobiologist at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, TX, remarked at the Planetary Caves conference, \u201ccaves provide access to the subsurface without the added weight of a drilling payload.\u201d\n Apollo astronauts, as part of their rock- and soil-collecting activities on the lunar surface, never drilled more than 2.9 meters into the surface. In contrast, the walls of lunar skylights can measure tens of meters thick and show distinct layers. Some of those layers may be ancient lava flows that could be dated to show when and how often volcanic activity occurred, Kerber notes. Sandwiched between those strata may be layers of regolith, or pulverized rock, formed by the incessant pounding of meteorite impacts. The thickness of such layers may help researchers estimate the rates at which such impacts occurred in the past. The rates and timing of such impacts would be roughly the same as those Earth experienced, so they may shed light on the planet\u2019s environment as life emerged\u2014and whether it was snuffed out before emerging again. Moreover, detailed chemical analyses of those materials may reveal information about past variations in the solar wind, whose charged particles become trapped in the regolith. Tracing the history of the solar wind could also shed light on variations in Earth\u2019s ancient climate. For one thing, a more active sun may have emitted more planet-warming radiation along with torrents of charged particles.\n Kerber and her colleagues have come up with an idea for how to reach those skylight strata: a lunar rover that deploys a rappelling robot whose wheels are chock full of instruments and sensors ( 7,  8). After approaching the skylight as close as researchers dare\u2014slopes near the hole consist of loose material and can be as steep as 20\u00b0\u2014the rover pays out the yo-yo-bot on a 300-meter-long tether that carries power and communications. As currently conceived, those instruments include a trio of high-resolution cameras, a microscope that gathers images at various wavelengths, and a spectrometer to chemically analyze minerals. Other tools include a small grinder to remove surface patina and expose bare rock.\n One big constraint on such a mission would be time, Kerber notes. The lander would need to set down on the moon, deploy its rover, and conduct its analyses all within the span of about 14 days, the length of time between lunar sunrise and sunset. That\u2019s because the exceptionally frigid conditions of the lunar night could wreak havoc on fragile electronics, sensors, and batteries, making it unknown whether the equipment would \u201cwake up\u201d when the next dawn arrived.\n The discovery of minerals formed by water, along with other data gathered by orbiting probes, landers, and rovers, suggest that billions of years ago Mars was warmer, wetter, and had a thicker atmosphere than it does today. If life ever evolved on the Red Planet, and if it was anything like life on Earth, it wouldn\u2019t be living on the Mars surface today, says Lee. Besides being cold and arid, the surface is exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet radiation. The lack of a strong magnetic field means that cosmic rays and energetic particles from the sun are free to stream down, adding to the radiation hazard. Static electricity in the planet\u2019s fierce dust storms helps create reactive chemicals called perchlorates that are toxic to any Earthlike life.\n \u201cIf life exists there, or existed there in the past, it probably will be best maintained in the subsurface, away from harsh surface conditions and processes.\u201d\n \u201cBut when you look at the subsurface, all of a sudden a lot of these problems go away,\u201d Lee notes. Phillips-Lander agrees: \u201cIf life exists there, or existed there in the past, it probably will be best maintained in the subsurface, away from harsh surface conditions and processes.\u201d\n Just as they do on the moon and Earth, lava tubes on Mars could provide a relatively stable environment. And even if that environment isn\u2019t amenable for life today, it could have been life\u2019s last holdout on a dying planet. At a time when large extraterrestrial impacts were more common, lava tubes could also have sheltered life from many of their devastating effects ( 9).\n So, one of NASA\u2019s goals should be to determine whether there are any bioindicators\u2014signs of past or present life\u2014in Martian lava tubes ( 10), Phillips-Lander proposed at the caves conference. Such signs could include organic chemicals, which might fluoresce under certain wavelengths of light. Or they could be visible remnants of biofilms created by communities of microbes. Or if such obvious signs of life are absent, other signs of past life\u2014 such as fossilized microbial filaments or even fossil cells\u2014could show up within minerals that formed on cave walls and were then preserved ( 11), says Michael Spilde, a mineralogist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.\n Exploring lava tubes on the moon and Mars might yield information not only about those bodies and their impact histories but also about the Earth and the Sun. These features, says Kerber, would be \u201clike a time capsule for early solar system history.\u201d\n View Abstract", "posttime": "2020-07-12 22:48:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "The B-17 Flying Fortress rolled off the drawing board and onto the runway in a mere 12 months, just in time to become the fearsome workhorse of the US Air Force during World War II. Its astounding toughness made pilots adore it: The B-17 could roar through angry squalls of shrapnel and bullets, emerging pockmarked but still airworthy. It was a symbol of American ingenuity, held aloft by four engines, bristling with a dozen machine guns.\n Imagine being a pilot of that mighty plane. You know your primary enemy\u2014the Germans and Japanese in your gunsights. But you have another enemy that you can\u2019t see, and it strikes at the most baffling times. Say you\u2019re easing in for another routine landing. You reach down to deploy your landing gear. Suddenly, you hear the scream of metal tearing into the tarmac. You\u2019re rag-dolling around the cockpit while your plane skitters across the runway. A thought flickers across your mind about the gunners below and the other crew: &#34;Whatever has happened to them now, it\u2019s my fault.&#34; When your plane finally lurches to a halt, you wonder to yourself: &#34;How on earth did my plane just crash when everything was going fine? What have I done?&#34;\n For all the triumph of America\u2019s new planes and tanks during World War II, a silent reaper stalked the battlefield: accidental deaths and mysterious crashes that no amount of training ever seemed to fix. And it wasn\u2019t until the end of the war that the Air Force finally resolved to figure out what had happened.\n  To do that, the Air Force called upon a young psychologist at the Aero Medical Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. Paul Fitts was a handsome man with a soft Tennessee drawl, analytically minded but with a shiny wave of Brylcreemed hair, Elvis-like, which projected a certain suave nonconformity. Decades later, he\u2019d become known as one of the Air Force\u2019s great minds, the person tasked with hardest, weirdest problems\u2014such as figuring out why people saw UFOs.\n For now though, he was still trying to make his name with a newly minted PhD in experimental psychology. Having an advanced degree in psychology was still a novelty; with that novelty came a certain authority. Fitts was supposed to know how people think. But his true talent is to realize that he doesn\u2019t.\n  When the thousands of reports about plane crashes landed on Fitts\u2019s desk, he could have easily looked at them and concluded that they were all the pilot\u2019s fault\u2014that these fools should have never been flying at all. That conclusion would have been in keeping with the times. The original incident reports themselves would typically say \u201cpilot error,\u201d and for decades no more explanation was needed. This was, in fact, the cutting edge of psychology at the time. Because so many new draftees were flooding into the armed forces, psychologists had begun to devise aptitude tests that would find the perfect job for every soldier. If a plane crashed, the prevailing assumption was: That person should not have been flying the plane. Or perhaps they should have simply been better trained. It was their fault.\n  But as Fitts pored over the Air Force\u2019s crash data, he realized that if \u201caccident prone\u201d pilots really were the cause, there would be randomness in what went wrong in the cockpit. These kinds of people would get hung on anything they operated. It was in their nature to take risks, to let their minds wander while landing a plane. But Fitts didn\u2019t see noise; he saw a pattern. And when he went to talk to the people involved about what actually happened, they told of how confused and terrified they\u2019d been, how little they understood in the seconds when death seemed certain.\n  The examples slid back and forth on a scale of tragedy to tragicomic: pilots who slammed their planes into the ground after misreading a dial; pilots who fell from the sky never knowing which direction was up; the pilots of B-17s who came in for smooth landings and yet somehow never deployed their landing gear. And others still, who got trapped in a maze of absurdity, like the one who, having jumped into a brand-new plane during a bombing raid by the Japanese, found the instruments completely rearranged. Sweaty with stress, unable to think of anything else to do, he simply ran the plane up and down the runway until the attack ended.\n Fitts&#39; data showed that during one 22-month period of the war, the Air Force reported an astounding 457 crashes just like the one in which our imaginary pilot hit the runway thinking everything was fine. But the culprit was maddeningly obvious for anyone with the patience to look. Fitts&#39; colleague Alfonse Chapanis did the looking. When he started investigating the airplanes themselves, talking to people about them, sitting in the cockpits, he also didn\u2019t see evidence of poor training. He saw, instead, the impossibility of flying these planes at all. Instead of \u201cpilot error,\u201d he saw what he called, for the first time, \u201cdesigner error.\u201d\n The reason why all those pilots were crashing when their B-17s were easing into a landing was that the flaps and landing gear controls looked exactly the same. The pilots were simply reaching for the landing gear, thinking they were ready to land. And instead, they were pulling the wing flaps, slowing their descent, and driving their planes into the ground with the landing gear still tucked in. Chapanis came up with an ingenious solution: He created a system of distinctively shaped knobs and levers that made it easy to distinguish all the controls of the plane merely by feel, so that there\u2019s no chance of confusion even if you\u2019re flying in the dark.\n By law, that ingenious bit of design\u2014known as shape coding\u2014still governs landing gear and wing flaps in every airplane today. And the underlying idea is all around you: It\u2019s why the buttons on your videogame controller are differently shaped, with subtle texture differences so you can tell which is which. It\u2019s why the dials and knobs in your car are all slightly different, depending on what they do. And it\u2019s the reason your virtual buttons on your smartphone adhere to a pattern language.\n But Chapanis and Fitts were proposing something deeper than a solution for airplane crashes. Faced with the prospect of soldiers losing their lives to poorly designed machinery, they invented a new paradigm for viewing human behavior. That paradigm lies behind the user-friendly world that we live in every day. They realized that it was absurd to train people to operate a machine and assume they would act perfectly under perfect conditions.\n Instead, designing better machines meant figuring how people acted without thinking, in the fog of everyday life, which might never be perfect. You couldn\u2019t assume humans to be perfectly rational sponges for training. You had to take them as they were: distracted, confused, irrational under duress. Only by imagining them at their most limited could you design machines that wouldn\u2019t fail them.\n This new paradigm took root slowly at first. But by 1984\u2014four decades after Chapanis and Fitts conducted their first studies\u2014Apple was touting a computer for the rest of us in one of its first print ads for the Macintosh: &#34;On a particularly bright day in Cupertino, California, some particularly bright engineers had a particularly bright idea: Since computers are so smart, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to  teach computers about people, instead of teaching people about computers? So it was that those very engineers worked long days and nights and a few legal holidays, teaching silicon chips all about people.  How they make mistakes and change their minds. How they refer to file folders and save old phone numbers. How they labor for their livelihoods, and doodle in their spare time.&#34; (Emphasis mine.) And that easy-to-digest language molded the smartphones and seamless technology we live with today.\n  Along the long and winding path to a user-friendly world, Fitts and Chapanis laid the most important brick. They realized that as much as humans might learn, they would always be prone to err\u2014and they inevitably brought presuppositions about how things should work to everything they used. This wasn\u2019t something you could teach of existence. In some sense, our limitations and preconceptions are what it means to be human\u2014and only by understanding those presumptions could you design a better world.\n  Today, this paradigm shift has produced trillions in economic value. We now presume that apps that reorder the entire economy should require no instruction manual at all; some of the most advanced computers ever made now come with only cursory instructions that say little more than &#34;turn it on.&#34; This is one of the great achievements of the last century of technological progress, with a place right alongside GPS, Arpanet, and the personal computer itself.\n It&#39;s also an achievement that remains unappreciated because we assume this is the way things should be. But with the assumption that even new technologies need absolutely no explaining comes a dark side: When new gadgets make assumptions about how we behave, they force unseen choices upon us. They don\u2019t merely defer to our desires. They shape them.\n  User friendliness is simply the fit between the objects around us and the ways we behave. So while we might think that the user-friendly world is one of making user-friendly things, the bigger truth is that design doesn\u2019t rely on artifacts; it relies on our patterns. The truest material for making new things isn\u2019t aluminum or carbon fiber. It\u2019s behavior. And today, our behavior is being shaped and molded in ways both magical and mystifying, precisely because it happens so seamlessly.\n I got a taste of this seductive, user-friendly magic recently, when I went to Miami to tour a full-scale replica of Carnival Cruise&#39;s so-called Ocean Medallion experience. I began my tour in a fake living room, with two of the best-looking project staffers pretending to be husband and wife, showing me how the whole thing was supposed to go.\n Using the app, you could reserve all your activities way before you boarded the ship. And once on board, all you needed was to carry was a disk the size of a quarter; using that, any one of the 4,000 touchscreens on the ship could beam you personalized information, such which way you needed to go for your next reservation. The experience recalled not just scenes from  Her and  Minority Report, but computer-science manifestos from the late 1980s that imagined a suite of gadgets that would adapt to who you are, morphing to your needs in the moment.\n Behind the curtains, in the makeshift workspace, a giant whiteboard wall was covered with a sprawling map of all the inputs that flow into some 100 different algorithms that crunch every bit of a passenger\u2019s preference behavior to create something called the \u201cPersonal Genome.\u201d If Jessica from Dayton wanted sunscreen and a mai tai, she could order them on her phone, and a steward would deliver them in person, anywhere across the sprawling ship.\n The server would greet Jessica by name, and maybe ask if she was excited about her kitesurfing lesson. Over dinner, if Jessica wanted to plan an excursion with friends, she could pull up her phone and get recommendations based on the overlapping tastes of the people she was sitting with. If only some people like fitness and others love history, then maybe they\u2019ll all like a walking tour of the market at the next port.\n  Jessica\u2019s Personal Genome would be recalculated three times a second by 100 different algorithms using millions of data points that encompassed nearly anything she did on the ship: How long she lingered on a recommendation for a sightseeing tour; the options that she  didn\u2019t linger on at all; how long she\u2019d actually spent in various parts of the ship; and what\u2019s nearby at that very moment or happening soon. If, while in her room, she had watched one of Carnival\u2019s slickly produced travel shows and seen something about a market tour at one her ports of call, she\u2019d later get a recommendation for that exact same tour when the time was right. \u201cSocial engagement is one of the things being calculated, and so is the nuance of the context,\u201d one of the executives giving me the tour said.\n  It was like having a right-click for the real world. Standing on the mocked-up sundeck, knowing that whatever I wanted would find me, and that whatever I might want would find its way either onto the app or the screens that lit up around the cruise ship as I walked around, it wasn\u2019t hard to see how many other businesses might try to do the same thing. In the era following World War II, the idea that designers could make the world easier to understand was a breakthrough.\n  But today, \u201cI understand what I should do\u201d has become \u201cI don\u2019t need to think at all.\u201d For businesses, intuitiveness has now become mandatory, because there are fortunes to be made by making things just a tad more frictionless. \u201cOne way to view this is creating this kind of frictionless experience is an option. Another way to look at it is that there\u2019s no choice,\u201d said John Padgett, the Carnival executive who had shepherded the Ocean Medallion to life. \u201cFor millennials, value is important. But hassle is more important, because the era they\u2019ve grow up in. It\u2019s table stakes. You have to be hassle-free to get them to participate.\u201d\n By that logic, the real world was getting to be disappointing when compared with the frictionless ease of this increasingly virtual world. Taken as a whole, Carnival\u2019s vision for seamless customer service that can anticipate your every whim was like an Uber for everything, powered by Netflix recommendations for meatspace. And these are in fact the experiences that many more designers will soon be striving for: invisible, everywhere, perfectly tailored, with no edges between one place and the next. Padgett described this as a \u201cmarket of one,\u201d in which everything you saw would be only the thing you want.\n The Market of One suggests to me a break point in the very idea of user friendliness. When Chapanis and Fitts were laying the seeds of the user-friendly world, they had to find the principles that underlie how we expect the world to behave. They had to preach the idea that products built on our assumptions about how things should work would eventually make even the most complex things easy to understand.\n Steve Jobs\u2019 dream of a \u201cbicycle for the mind\u201d\u2014a universal tool that might expand the reach of anyone\u2014has arrived. High technology has made our lives easier; made us better at our jobs, and created jobs that never existed before; it has made the people we care about closer to us. But friction also has value: It\u2019s friction that makes us question whether we do in fact need the thing we want. Friction is the path to introspection. Infinite ease quickly becomes the path of least resistance; it saps our free will, making us submit to someone else\u2019s guess about who we are. We can\u2019t let that pass. We have to become cannier, more critical consumers of the user-friendly world. Otherwise, we risk blundering into more crashes that we\u2019ll only understand after the worst has already happened.\n  Excerpted from  USER FRIENDLY: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play  by Cliff Kuang with Robert Fabricant.

"note_en": "If you added up all the space Manhattan devotes to cars, you\u2019d have an area nearly four times as large as Central Park.\n  As coronavirus lockdowns crept across the globe this winter and spring, an unusual sound fell over the world\u2019s metropolises: the hush of streets that were suddenly, blessedly free of cars. City dwellers reported hearing  bird song, wind and the rustling of leaves. (Along with, in New York City, the intermittent screams of sirens.)\n You could smell the absence of cars, too. From  New York to  Los Angeles to New Delhi, air pollution plummeted, and the soupy, exhaust-choked haze over the world\u2019s dirtiest cities  lifted to reveal brilliant blue skies.\n Video So it is. It is Friday. I spent several weeks working on this article that posted yesterday about cars and about the future of cities and why the in this time where you might think that you know this would be the wrong time to kind of make a bet on public transportation because people are worried about, oh, me media peeps know t.k. OK So t.k. is out. Well TV decided to come. So that \u2019s Tuesday. So you know, I \u2019ve been thinking for a while. So I love cars. I \u2019m a huge kind of gearhead. Do I look like a gearhead. Really but that \u2019s what I am. I always want I buy cars more often and eat too. I always want cars that are like, cool rather than practical. And whenever we go on vacation like to a new place I always want to kind of like, rent a cool car. I \u2019m a big fan of cars. I grew up in Southern California, which sort of is the reason I think that I \u2019m a big fan of cars that much for his so shiny. This is not a good luck Really. But like in the last few years, I \u2019ve become kind of increasingly disillusioned about cars like that the everywhere in the country traffic has gone traffic is just, like, impossible in New York where I don \u2019t live. But I visit often in Manhattan. Traffic is really kind of at the record low before the virus. The average speed in midtown for four car traffic was five miles per hour, which is slower which is slower than riding a bike and about just a tiny bit faster than walking. And so traffic is one. Number two is like I \u2019ve spent a lot of time following what the tech industry has been doing to kind of improve cars. You know the last decade has been kind of the decade of like cars in the tech industry. So we had Uber, you know in 2009 which kind of led the way to this shared vehicle. Look at cars where you know, you wouldn \u2019t have to own a car, you could just kind of buy fractional time on a car. Eventually you wouldn \u2019t even need the driver there because there \u2019d be self-driving cars and this. And the way that Uber talked about it. And the way that Lyft talked about it was that this would reduce car ownership. And it would reduce traffic in our big cities would be kind of a boon for the environment as well as for consumers because you didn \u2019t have to buy a car, you didn \u2019t have to park a car. You didn \u2019t have to have the worry of you know the hassle of owning a car in a city you just get fractional time on a car in a car. And in fact, you know a lot of people use it. It \u2019s been it \u2019s been extremely popular. But there are several problems with it. One is that it \u2019s like doesn \u2019t seem to be a profitable business. So it doesn \u2019t seem to be economically viable Uber lost 8 billion last year. And so number two, it \u2019s really not great for like labor and drivers. But the third one is that it \u2019s just really increased traffic like in every place where Uber has operated traffic has gone up the gains to kind of aiding carpooling haven \u2019t really paid off. What really happens is that there are previous cars on the road and there are now Uber cars on the road and others are sort of circling and parking everywhere and kind of blocking roads. And so that is increased congestion. The other thing that was going to change the car industry was electric cars. So you know, Tesla has really transformed the car business with its vision of electric cars and they \u2019ve sold a bunch of them. But the idea there was that like. It would spur the rest of the industry to go electric. And that \u2019s not really happening. There are a lot of car companies that announced electrics but they don \u2019t make a lot of money on electrics and so they sort of pause you their developments. Tesla is like you know one of Tesla, if you will, in the market for an electric car today you could get a Chevy Bolt you can get a Nissan leaf. You can get sort of one kind of plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius but really like your options are Tesla and the. So you know it may lead to sort of big change if carmakers kind of join the bandwagon but they make a ton of money on SUVs and a lot of the companies are you know, running their electric programs are called out basically like what people in industry call compliance cars. They \u2019re making electric cars. So they can sell enough of those. So they can like lower their fleet average. So that they can have room to sell a very profitable SUV. So it \u2019s sort of like the electric is like allowing car companies to sell gas guzzler SUVs that are extremely dangerous which are also going to be on the road for like 10 to 20 years. So you know like. And so the estimates for when we could get full electric is like you know of the American fleet is something like 15 to 20 years. So it \u2019s going to be a very, very long time before we turn to electric. And there \u2019s also not not really a electrics are better, more efficient than gas powered cars. But it really depends on how we generate electricity. Some of them are not very good options and also like it takes a lot of materials and takes a lot of energy and it takes a lot of like mining of minerals of you know cup cobalt lithium other things that you need precious resources. So they \u2019re not really like an environmental panacea. You have self-driving cars, which is sort of like the holy grail of the Silicon Valley car industry, which is like we will make cars that don \u2019t hurt people that are super convenient that you don \u2019t even need to drive. That will kind of transform the car industry. And this is the promise they \u2019ve been telling. You know they \u2019ve been this is a vision they \u2019ve been promising us for 10 years and really like the last five it \u2019s been like, oh electric cars will be around the corner. They \u2019re not it \u2019s going to be a long time before we get electric cars everywhere. I mean self-driving cars everywhere. They \u2019re running into lots of kind of human and infrastructure and weather and other problems. And so you know like you can bet that cars are going to be like reliably killing people for the next five to 10 years. It \u2019s not going to change. So I started thinking about this. And I started thinking about like how all of these car industry kind of promises for change and Silicon Valley promises for change. We \u2019re really kind of not really addressing the major problem. The major problem is like we have these vehicles. Now that are killing in America about 90,000 people a year about 40,000 people die in car crashes about 50,000 people die in kind of premature deaths caused by emissions from cars. And you know it \u2019s like all big cities. If you go to areas where there are lots of freeways just around the freeways you can see there \u2019s much higher concentrations of you know breathing problems, asthma lots of problems caused by air pollution. And you know thousands of people Tens of thousands of people are dying every year because of that, we. And so then the coronavirus happened and suddenly overnight around the world, people stopped using cars. But mostly because they were staying at home. But that because there were no cars on the road. People started looking at the streets in different ways. Like in all over the United States there were cities that closed down streets to cars and people started biking biking became see for walking became safer rollerblading became a thing. Skateboarding sales were up and in New York people started using city bike more and something amazing happened with the air pollution everywhere that cars kind of left the streets. You like in New Delhi which has terrible air pollution. People suddenly reported being able to see the blue skies you could see mountains in the distance in Harlem in Manhattan Air pollution fell 20% like toxic air pollution just because of the removal of cars. I mean, you know, you think of Manhattan as a relatively car free place. But you know all around. There \u2019s a toxic air pollution there \u2019s a lot of cars that are stuck in traffic that are causing air pollution in Los Angeles trapped. The air pollution went to record lows not seen in like 2005 years. So it was an amazing change. And I began to think like, why can \u2019t we. Why can \u2019t we keep this. Well, so one reason why you can \u2019t keep it is people are very worried about public transit. So when New York when other cities with transit kind of open up fully. People are worried that the trains are going to be overcrowded. And you may get the virus on there you know by riding transit or a bus. And so it seems like cars are the safest thing. The problem is that cars are not safe. They are actually dangerous. They kill people. And there \u2019s not enough room for them. So you know with Manhattan traffic for example, if it was already at 5 miles per hour. If more people choose to drive. It \u2019s just going to be no one move. So cars, even though they seem like a safe alternative for from the virus standpoint, they \u2019re not really like a good formative to you know, all the other modes of transportation. So what do we do. I started talking to a lot of urban planners and people who think about. And if the future of mobility and in particular, I started talking to v Sean chucker party who is a former urban planning official in New York City who runs this architecture firm in Manhattan he \u2019s the incoming dean of the architecture school at Berkeley. And he and his firm had been putting together this really, really intricate proposal looking at all of the benefits you could get if we took over the space that you use in Manhattan for cars and gave it to other more accessible forms of transportation and cheaper forms of transportation. So you know, if you so that the number the thing that really wanted to focus on was the kind of amount of space that we give to cars in cities. So, you know, it \u2019s everyone knows like cars are dangerous. Everyone knows cars are expensive cars are bad for the environment. I think a lot of people don \u2019t look at how much space cars use in our big cities. And you know we America \u2019s major cities are the most precious resource is is like physical space. You know in San Francisco and Los Angeles and New York in d.c. and kind of many, many major kind of economic hubs. Housing is super expensive, because there \u2019s not a lot of supply there because there \u2019s not a lot of room and you have like restrictive zoning laws that prevent building. And so you have limited land supply and also people have to commute in from really far away, because you know we \u2019re not building dense. And because because of cars kind of feed sprawl and so you have people living really far away because housing costs. You have people commuting very far. The removal of cars like giving up some of that space that we use for cars and using it for other things like housing better transportation could just revolutionize cities. If you just think about the amount of space that cars use and how better. We could use them. I think a lot of people understand that you know this is not cars are not the most efficient use of space. But I really wanted to figure out how to show that I mean, a lot of people have been talking about this. But so I started talking to v Sean and three of the other architects there about like the gains that we could get from banning cars in the most obvious place to start to look at ways is Manhattan because New York is already one of the most kind of car fleet free places in the country. It \u2019s one of the few places where most people don \u2019t own cars. So in New York City about 48 47% of people own households own cars. So like is a majority non-current car owning city in Manhattan. It \u2019s something like 75% of residents don \u2019t own cars. And the people who do own cars. I got a lot of pushback on this saying, you know this is going to be bad for lower income people to ban cars. But in fact, like that. If you look at any kind of stat about car owners car drivers. They are wealthier than non car owners in every part of New York City. And so you know it \u2019s a real. It \u2019s sort of an interesting thing where the city is giving up this vast tracts of land to relatively wealthy people who are driving for their own kind of convenience and pleasure. And that land is not really being kind of paid for in any way. You know all the things you think of as like a charge on cars like gas taxes and tolls and stuff really don \u2019t cover the building of roads and the space devoted to roads. And so it \u2019s really kind of like a gift of all this precious land to car users to car drivers. And so like how better to use that space. And so Sean and his team came up with these really this really amazing plan for how much better life in New York could be if Manhattan alone banned not all motor vehicles. But just private cars. So there could still be Uber there could still be lifts there could still be delivery trucks there could still be emergency vehicles there could still be a lot of people said that I didn \u2019t sort of mention problems for disabled people. But there could be you know Paratransit would every other form of. And you know accessible public transit every other form of transportation with the absence of cars would be made better. And what do I mean by better. I mean faster better, more availability better service. So last year Manhattan closed parts of 14th Street to car traffic and in order to make the 14th Street as in lower Manhattan and in order to make bus Crosstown bus service much faster. So it used to take something like 40 minutes to get across town. And now it \u2019s like half that because there \u2019s no cars. And that would be that \u2019s sort of the gain you get from cars. So from giving up space to cars. So instead of, you know all Manhattan residential streets pretty much all of them have street parking on the side and a lane of car traffic in the middle. And the bigger roads have several lanes of car traffic plus street parking. Plus a lot of like medians and other kind of safety features you need in the road to prevent cars from hitting everyone else. If you remove that space, which is the space devoted to cars in Manhattan is something like a third of the island \u2019s space, which is an incredible amount. If you remove that space from cars you could have room for bus rapid transit, which is like a bus system where it goes has dedicated lanes has platforms for people to get in on buses really goes much faster. You can have bus rapid transit across Manhattan and from on the bridges and tunnels coming into Manhattan. So you know if you \u2019re in one of the kind of bedroom communities around New York City. If you live in one of the outer Boroughs you could come into the city either on public transit or in either on trains or in something like bus rapid transit which would you know connect to outer Boroughs. And like further off. Right and the plans would also include Uber and taxis would also be available on the island. And the other thing that you would get space for would be big sort of two lane protected bike lanes on pretty much every street in Manhattan. And you don \u2019t the streets those lanes don \u2019t have to be used for bikes. There \u2019s all these new sort of micro mobility devices, things people hate like scooters and an electric skateboards. But the reason people hate those is because they \u2019re taking up. They \u2019re taking up sidewalk space. Now because there \u2019s not. And people hate them because they \u2019re running into pedestrians. But if there was more space for bikes and there was more space for pedestrians and less space for cars those other things wouldn \u2019t seem as annoying either. People are annoyed by scooters because they \u2019re just like littering the sidewalk. But if they didn \u2019t have to litter the sidewalk and then were sidewalks bigger you know, even scooters would be sort of better. So they should have like every everything in favor like you look at this plan and it \u2019s really hard to think of a downside for people. Even a downside for the car driver. So one thing they found in coming up with this kind of plan for no cars in New York is you remove cars from Manhattan bus service becomes so fast it becomes sort of as fast as the subway. So you can get from uptown downtown in something like 20 to 30 minutes you could get you know like trips that used to take two hours on buses get down to like 30 minutes you get huge gains for the speed of buses you know, coming into the island from you know the outer Boroughs or in cities in the cities around New York would be cut dramatically that the amount of time people spend on the ride. So it \u2019s even better for people who do drive cars one of the things we noticed they noticed in the plan is like if you ban cars from Manhattan. There will be so much less traffic around Manhattan that like if you started even trips that didn \u2019t involve Manhattan. So like if you went from one place in Brooklyn by car to another place in Brooklyn by car or the Bronx for example, you get less traffic on those routes because all the traffic going sort of clogging up the outer Boroughs through and through on the way to Manhattan is not there. So you know even if you \u2019re a car driver who doesn \u2019t drive in Manhattan you \u2019ll get better traffic. And then the public health benefits are amazing in Manhattan as a result. By banning cars you get a 50% reduction in toxic pollution. And in the outer Boroughs where there \u2019s a lot of pollution because there \u2019s a lot of cars kind of sitting on the road idling on the roads you get a 20% reduction in toxic air pollution. So you kill fewer people by accidents you kill fewer people by air pollution and you get around faster and it \u2019s cheaper, it \u2019s more accessible for people on at every income scale. You don \u2019t have to have you know money to buy a car to maintain a car to sort of live in access like the economy of New York. To me, it was just like a home run sale. And so we came up with this way of showing all these benefits in in graphical form. In the article, and it it really resonated and got a lot of it. I feel like, you know a of people have written about burning cars in various parts of the country and in New York specifically in Manhattan. People have been calling for banning cars since the 60s. What I really thought was interesting about this model from fission is that it had just a lot of kind of detail. And it shows off the benefits that you would get. OK So I got a lot of comments criticisms about it. I \u2019m going to go through them. We can talk about the issue. If you have any thoughts to you can or questions you can write them random right here. OK So on Twitter Kevin de good said, we cannot simply assume this change would be uniformly beneficial for residents of every age and ability level as of 2018. Only 119 of two. So 25 percent of New York subways were fully accessible. New Jersey Transit is a bit better, but not much rate like this would require an improvement of public transit generally for accessibility but also just for capacity like if there are no cars more people would need to use the subway and the buses and everything else. And you wouldn \u2019t need you would have to. It would have to come after like a long build out of infrastructure. So this is like the cost of it. We have to change the roads we \u2019d have to change the creative bus rapid transit system. And you have to make sure those are accessible and accessible for four disabled people, but also accessible in terms like econ\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-12 22:46:00", "source_domain":

According to the toy historian Tim Walsh, a staggering 94 percent of mothers are aware of Candy Land, and more than 60 percent of households with a 5-year-old child own a set. The game continues to sell about 1 million copies every year.\n  You know how it goes: Players race down a sinuous but linear track, its spaces tinted one of six colors or marked by a special candy symbol. They draw from a deck of cards corresponding to the board\u2019s colors and symbols. They move their token to the next space that matches the drawn color or teleport to the space matching the symbol. The first to reach the end of the track is the winner.\n  Nothing the participants say or do influences the outcome; the winner is decided the second the deck is shuffled, and all that remains is to see it revealed, one draw at a time. It is a game absent strategy, requiring little thought. Consequently, many parents  hate Candy Land as much as their young kids enjoy it.\n Yet for all its simplicity and limitations, children still love Candy Land, and adults still buy it. What makes it so appealing? The answer may have something to do with the game\u2019s history: It was invented by Eleanor Abbott, a schoolteacher, in a polio ward during the epidemic of the 1940s and \u201950s.\n    The outbreak had forced children into extremely restrictive environments. Patients were confined by equipment, and parents kept healthy children inside for fear they might catch the disease. Candy Land offered the kids in Abbott\u2019s ward a welcome distraction\u2014but it also gave immobilized patients a liberating fantasy of movement. That aspect of the game still resonates with children today.\n   Poliomyelitis\u2014better known as polio\u2014was once a feared disease. It struck suddenly, paralyzing its victims, most of whom were children. The virus targets the nerve cells in the spinal cord, inhibiting the body\u2019s control over its muscles. This leads to muscle weakness, decay, or outright fatality in extreme cases. The leg muscles are the most common sites of polio damage, along with the muscles of the head, neck, and diaphragm. In the last case, a patient would require the aid of an iron lung, a massive, coffinlike enclosure that forces the afflicted body to breathe. For children, whose still-developing bodies are more vulnerable to polio infection, the muscle wastage from polio can result in disfigurement if left untreated. Treatment typically involves physical therapy to stimulate muscle development, followed by braces to ensure that the affected parts of the body retain their shape.\n  Vaccines appeared in the 1950s, and the disease was essentially eradicated by the end of the millennium. But in the mid-century, polio was a medical bogeyman, ushering in a climate of hysteria. \u201cThere was no prevention and no cure,\u201d the historian David M. Oshinsky  writes.\u201cEveryone was at risk, especially children. There was nothing a parent could do to protect the family.\u201d Like the outbreak of AIDS in the 1980s, polio\u2019s eruption caused fear because its vectors of transmission were poorly understood, its virulence uncertain, and its repercussions unlike those of other illnesses. Initially, polio was called \u201cinfantile paralysis\u201d because it struck mostly children, seemingly at random. The evidence of infection was uniquely visible and visceral compared with that of infectious diseases of the past, too. \u201cIt maimed rather than killed,\u201d as Patrick Cockburn  puts it. \u201cIts symbol was less the coffin than the wheelchair.\u201d\n Children of the era faced an unenviable lot, whether infected with polio or not. Gerald Shepherd provides a glimpse of the paranoiac atmosphere of the polio scare and its effects on children  in a firsthand account of his San Diego childhood in the late 1940s, at the height of the epidemic. Quarantine and seclusion were the most common preventative measures:\n Our parents didn\u2019t know what to do to protect us except to isolate us from other children \u2026 One time I stuck my hand through a window and badly cut myself, and despite several stitches and wads of protective bandaging, my father still grounded me that week for fear polio germs might filter in through the sutures.\n Kids his age were well aware of what polio could do. \u201cEvery time one of our buddies got sick,\u201d Shepherd recollects, \u201cwe figured he was headed for the iron lung.\u201d If you caught polio, you would be committed to a hospital with a chance of being forever anchored to a machine. If you didn\u2019t catch it, you would be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future (which, from a child\u2019s perspective, might as well be forever).\n    For a child of the 1940s or \u201950s, polio meant the same thing whether you contracted it or not: confinement.\n  The Milton Bradley executive Mel Taft  said that Abbott, the inventor of Candy Land, was \u201ca real sweetheart\u201d whom he liked immediately. According to Walsh, the toy historian, the two met when Abbott brought Milton Bradley a Candy Land prototype sketched on butcher paper. \u201cEleanor was just as sweet as could be,\u201d Taft recalled. \u201cShe was a schoolteacher who lived in a very modest home in San Diego.\u201d\n Details about her life outside this interaction are scant. Curators at the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, say that the museum has no holdings in its extensive archives from Abbott\u2019s records; they rely on Walsh\u2019s account. Walsh told me that Taft was his only source, and Hasbro, which now owns Milton Bradley, did not respond to a request for records that might verify Abbott as the game\u2019s inventor. Among the few facts researchers have unearthed about her: A phone book containing her number  exists in the collections of the San Diego Historical Society (the only trace of her in its archives). And according to some accounts, she gave much of the royalties she earned from Candy Land to children\u2019s charities.\n  There is reason to believe that Abbott was ideally suited to consider polio from a child\u2019s perspective. As a schoolteacher, she would have been acquainted with children\u2019s thoughts and needs. And in 1948, when she was in her late 30s, she herself contracted the disease. Abbott recuperated in the polio ward of a San Diego hospital, spending her convalescence primarily among children.\n Imagine what it must have been like to share an entire hospital ward with children struggling against polio, day after day, as an adult. Kids are poorly equipped to cope with boredom and separation from their loved ones under normal circumstances. But it would be even more unbearable for a child confined to a bed or an iron lung. That was the context in which Abbott made her recovery.\n  Seeing children suffer around her, Abbott set out to concoct some escapist entertainment for her young wardmates, a game that left behind the strictures of the hospital ward for an adventure that spoke to their wants: the desire to move freely in the pursuit of delights, an easy privilege polio had stolen from them.\n  From today\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s tempting to see Candy Land as a tool of quarantine, an excuse to keep kids inside in the way Shepherd remembers. The board game gathers all your children in one place, occupying their time and attention. Samira Kawash, a Rutgers University professor,  suggests that this is the main way polio informed the game\u2019s development. \u201cThe point of Candy Land is to pass the time,\u201d she writes, \u201ccertainly a virtue when one\u2019s days are spent in the boring confines of the hospital and an appealing feature as well of a game used to pass the time indoors for children confined to the house.\u201d For Kawash, Candy Land justifies and extends the imprisonment of the hospital, becoming another means of restriction.\n    But the themes of Candy Land tell a different story. Every element of Abbott\u2019s game symbolizes shaking off the polio epidemic\u2019s impositions. And this becomes apparent if you consider the game\u2019s board and mechanics relative to what children in polio wards would have seen and felt.\n  In 2010, when he was almost 70 years old, the polio survivor Marshall Barr  recalled how only brief escapes from the iron lung were possible. The doctors \u201cused to come and say, \u2018You can come out for a little while,\u2019 and I used to sit up perhaps to have a cup of tea,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut then they would have to keep an eye on me because my fingers would go blue and in about 15 minutes I would have to go back in again.\u201d Children would have played Abbott\u2019s early version of Candy Land during these breaks, or in their bed.\n  Walsh reports that kids loved Abbott\u2019s game, and \u201csoon she was encouraged to submit it to Milton Bradley.\u201d In part, anything that would have reduced boredom would have excited kids during treatment. As the historian Daniel J. Wilson  explains, the wards provided little to occupy their young occupants. \u201cIn most cases, patients had to find ways to entertain themselves,\u201d he writes.\n  It was a tall order. The ward\u2019s setup taxed the imagination. The staff, fellow patients, or radio broadcasts would have been a child\u2019s sole company\u2014only doctors and nurses were allowed in the room.  Images of polio wards depict a geometry even more rigid and sterile than that of typical hospital settings: row upon row of treatment beds and iron lungs. The children lying supine in iron lungs could see only what was on either side of their head (a line of patients telescoping down the ward) or reflected in mirrors mounted overhead (the floor\u2019s tessellation of bleached tiles).\n Candy Land offered a soothing contrast. Repeating tiles line the game\u2019s board, but instead of a uniform, regimented grid, Abbott rearranged them into a meandering rainbow ribbon. Even tracing it with your eyes is stimulating\u2014an especially welcome feature if illness has rendered them the most mobile part of your body.\n  A colorful chocolate-and-candy landscape seems like the game\u2019s main attraction, but Candy Land\u2019s play revolves around movement. In theme and execution, the game functions as a mobility fantasy. It simulates a leisurely stroll instead of the studied rigor of therapeutic exercise. And unlike the challenges of physical therapy, movement in Candy Land is so effortless, it\u2019s literally all one can do. Every card drawn either compels you forward or whisks you some distance across the board. Each turn promises either the pleasure of unencumbered travel or the thrill of unexpected flight. The game counters the culture of restriction imposed by both the polio scare and the disease itself.\n    The joy of movement, especially for polio patients, seems to have been integral to Abbott\u2019s design philosophy from the start. The  original board even depicts the tentative steps of a boy in a leg brace.\n The game also recognizes that mobility entails autonomy. At least part of Candy Land\u2019s appeal is the feeling of independence it provides its young players. In a backstory printed in the game\u2019s  instruction manual, the player tokens (in the current edition, four brightly colored plastic gingerbread men) are said to represent the players\u2019 \u201cguides.\u201d They represent the chance to be an active agent, with assistance\u2014an ambulatory adventurer, not a prisoner of the hospital or home. The game may even mark the first time a player feels like a protagonist.\n  The threat of polio has lessened over time, but Candy Land\u2019s value persists because of what it teaches. This is not to rehash the usual litany of early-childhood skills some Candy Land proponents  tout. Yes, the game strengthens pattern recognition. Sure, it can teach children to read and follow instructions. In theory, it shows children how to play together\u2014how to win humbly or lose graciously. But any game can teach these skills.\n  Candy Land\u2019s lessons are not to be found in the game, but in its results. Now that polio is a distant fear and mobility a power taken for granted, most games of Candy Land disappoint. The rules today are the same as they were in 1949, but something about the proceedings simply does not add up. Eventually, children recognize that they don\u2019t have a hand in winning or losing. The deck chooses for them. An ordained victory is an empty one, without the satisfaction of triumph through skills or smarts.\n When children want a more challenging experience, they leave Candy Land behind. And that, in the end, is what makes Candy Land priceless: It is designed to be outgrown. Abbott\u2019s game originally taught children, immobilized and separated from family, to envision a world beyond the polio ward, where opportunities for growth and adventure could still materialize. Today that lesson persists more broadly. The game teaches children that all arrangements have their alternatives. It\u2019s the start of learning how to imagine a better world than the one they inherited. As it has done for generations, Candy Land continues to send young children on the first steps of that journey.\n     We want to hear what you think about this article.

"note_en": "Imagine this: An airline loses your checked bag. After an extensive search, customer support comes up empty-handed. They compensate you and life goes on.\n But life goes on for your suitcase, too. Written off as \u201cunclaimed,\u201d it sits in a musty collection depot for 3 months. Eventually, the airline sells it \u2014 along with hundreds of other lost suitcases and cargo shipments \u2014 to a private company, sight unseen.\n The new owner cracks the lock, sifts through your former possessions, and marks them for sale.\n A few days later, a retired mechanic named Charlie buys your grandfather\u2019s watch for $150. A 19-year-old line cook acquires your Beats headphones. And a nurse from Florida becomes the proud new owner of the scarf your mom knitted you for Christmas.\n    Every year,  4.3B bags are checked by airlines around the world. Around  25m of them\u00a0 ( 5.7 per 1k bags checked) end up lost or misdirected. The  0.03% of bags that are still not reunited with their owners after 90 days are sold by the airline.\n  Nestled in the small town of Scottsboro, Alabama (pop: 14.7k), Unclaimed Baggage holds the distinction of being \u201cthe nation\u2019s only retailer of lost luggage.\u201d Its massive 40k-sq-ft warehouse holds thousands of treasures lost in transit, ranging from rare instruments to monogrammed engagement rings.\n Every now and then, a piece of luggage contains something truly extraordinary, like a suit of armor, an Egyptian artifact, or a camera used in NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle program.\n What are the ethics of reselling travelers\u2019 intimate items? How does the process work? And how did one company come to monopolize this niche market?\n   Born and raised in Scottsboro, Owens had served in the Korean War and returned to his hometown to sell insurance. Between shifts, he spent every waking hour by his  ham radio, using radio frequency spectrum to communicate to friends and strangers. At 39, he was restless and looking for his next adventure.\n One day, through the radio chatter, he learned that a bus company in Washington, DC, had an enormous stack of unclaimed luggage it was looking to get rid of.\n In those days, unclaimed bags were often thrown away or auctioned off to local junk shops. Few saw value in travelers\u2019 lost wares. But to Owens, the suitcases \u2014 and the intrigue of their contents \u2014 were a perfect foundation to build a business on.\n So, he borrowed  $300 (~$2k in 2020 dollars) from his father-in-law and purchased the whole lot.\n   On the edge of town, Owens set up an informal storefront, crafted a sign (\u201cUnclaimed Baggage\u201d) by the door, and, with the help of his wife and 2 sons, splayed out his acquired items on card tables. He ran a small ad in the local paper, informing Jackson County deal-seekers of his new venture.\n In less than 24 hours, he sold out of inventory and pocketed a tidy profit.\n The novelty of sifting through lost luggage soon spread by word-of-mouth and Owen\u2019s repeated the process. His boss eventually gave him an ultimatum: Sell insurance, or sell baggage. He quit and set out to turn his side hustle into a full-time job.\n By 1978, Owens had struck deals to buy luggage from Eastern Airlines, National Airlines, and Air Florida (now defunct). In constant transit between DC, Miami, Cleveland, and Dallas, he was soon acquiring 3k pieces of luggage per month, with help from a staff of 6 people.\n \u201cWe never know what\u2019s in those suitcases until we open them,\u201d he told the AP that year. \u201cIt\u2019s like buying a pig in a poke.\u201d\n  A man marks suitcases at Sydney International Airport in 1985 (Peter Morris/Fairfax Media via Getty Images)\n Even the most macabre of items seemed to intrigue his customers: A marble tombstone inscribed with a name and a date of death was purchased by a gentleman who made it into a coffee table. An Amazonian shrunken head (found in a suitcase in the pre-TSA days) found a home with a doctor in Birmingham.\n Over the years, the business expanded \u2014 largely thanks to a number of secretive, exclusive deals Owens inked with major airlines, hospitality groups, and cargo carriers.\n By the time he died in 2016, he\u2019d received 3 keys from 3 different Scottsboro mayors. Everyone in town knew his name. And his one-of-a-kind business had become an internationally recognized tourist destination.\n  Today\u2019s Unclaimed Baggage is a far cry from the card tables and backroom bus deals of the past.\n Since taking over the business in 1995, Owens\u2019 son, Bryan, has expanded the store into a  50k-square-foot behemoth. Before COVID, thousands of pieces of luggage \u2014 up to  7k unique items \u2014 were flowing through the doors every day. The store\u2019s dedicated laundry facility, used to clean  70k clothing items per month, is the largest in Alabama.\n Last year, more than  1m customers from all over the world flocked to the small town 140 miles northwest of Atlanta to see what kinds of treasures they could forage.\n  Top: a customer checks out shoes at the Unclaimed Baggage store in Scottsboro, Alabama; bottom: crowds browse the expansive women\u2019s clothing section (Unclaimed Baggage)\n In the last decade, airlines have invested heavily in  RFID chips and central monitoring systems to reduce lost luggage. This isn\u2019t just to keep customers happy: The cost of hunting down lost luggage sets airlines back   $2.1B per year  in overhead costs. When they can\u2019t find your bag, they are liable to  compensate you for your loss (up to $3,500 for domestic flights and $1,780 for international).\n  Unclaimed Baggage purchases not only lost checked bags, but items forgotten in overhead bins and the front flap of the chair (reading glasses are common). They also buy tons of oversized cargo and freight \u2014 surfboards, skis, wheelchairs, rugs.\n The company is extremely secretive about its \u201csalvage agreements\u201d with airlines and won\u2019t divulge who it partners with, or how much it pays for luggage. But usually, it will fork over a set price per bag or by pay by weight.\n Like  storage units, these purchases are \u201cblind:\u201d they never know what\u2019s tinside.\n When the luggage arrives at the store\u2019s sorting facility by tractor trailer, the company\u2019s 150+ employees follow a procedure:\n Items are  sorted into 3 general categories: a) resell, b) repurpose/donate, or c) recycle/throw away.\n The bags have already been screened at the airport, but things often slip through the cracks. Anything of an \u201cillegal nature\u201d (drugs, weapons, unmarked cash) is immediately turned over to the local authorities under lock and key.\n   Top: a man browses through hundreds of headphones; bottom: watches \u2014 some of which are expensive and rare finds \u2014 line the glass cases (Unclaimed Baggage)\n \u201cThere are a lot of frogs before you get to the prince,\u201d Brenda Cantrell, the store\u2019s director, says of the sorting process. \u201cWe\u2019re very skilled at getting rid of the frogs. It\u2019s a tedious process that we\u2019ve perfected over the past 50 years.\u201d\n In the end, only about  one-third of the items in baggage end up for sale \u2014 usually marked down anywhere from 20-80% off list price.\n An additional  one-third is donated to  dozens of charities: wheelchairs go to prisons and veteran groups; strollers go to teen pregnancy centers; some clothes go to homeless shelters.\n  Cantrell estimates that  60% of the items found in suitcases are clothes or accessories. Headphones, e-readers, and neck pillows are also in abundance.\n Perhaps most unfortunately, the store sees a reliable stream of wedding dresses, wedding bands, and engagement rings. (\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether those people were going to a wedding or coming home from one,\u201d says Cantrell.)\n  Top: a customer poses with his find, an antique case; bottom: an Unclaimed Baggage employee demonstrates how the company typically sorts through a suitcase when it arrives at the facility (Unclaimed Baggage)\n But the sheer volume of baggage they receive also yields finds that are extremely  strange, rare, and  unusual:\n  The shop\u2019s recently launched  online store (which features a smaller selection of unclaimed baggage) has its own share of ridiculous stuff:\n    On a few occasions, shoppers have inadvertently come across their  own lost items in the store.\n A few years ago, a man who\u2019d recently lost a suitcase flying back from Europe was browsing through the men\u2019s clothing section and spotted his own custom-made lavender suit. He bought it back.\n  When Unclaimed Baggage found Hoggle, the Jim Henson puppet from the 1986 film, Labyrinth, he was in poor shape, so they hired master dollmaker Gary Sowatzka (top) to restore it (Sowatzka\u2019s Dolls, Unclaimed Baggage)\n On occasion, the store will also get items lost by celebrities, who aren\u2019t immune to the luggage mishaps of mere mortals.\n In  1992, Roy Hall, a 46-year-old minister, bought a royal blue Hickey-Freeman jacket at Unclaimed Baggage. When he took it home, he noticed the name \u201cWhitey Ford\u201d \u2014 a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Yankees \u2014 written inside of it. Informed of the find, Ford asked for his jacket back; Hall decided to keep it.\n Some say the store has an ethical duty to reunite people with their lost luggage \u2014 especially highly personal

"note_en": "A couple of months ago I received a present, a small book titled \u2018Why we sleep\u2019 by Matthew walker. It is an interesting book that takes you through the physiological and psychological effects of sleeping and the damage done by lack of sleep. I don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to each and every bit in the book, there are certain passages that ring as though the data does not support them but all in all it did open my eyes to how much damage I\u2019ve been doing to my body over the years. It also convinced me that this needs to stop.\n  Ever since I started programming properly at the ripe old age of 15 it has been like that. My usual daily rhythm would be to sleep late, get up, slowly get started and by 8 pm or so I\u2019d be moving fast and this would last until daybreak. Sometimes I\u2019d go without sleep for a day, sometimes for two. Once messed up like that because of a single night it would take weeks, or even months to get back to \u2018normal\u2019. Because of the health effects and the fact that this makes it much harder to interact with the rest of the world (I  do have a family and also a business to run) the time has come to put a stop to this. But it\u2019s not that easy.\n What I love about the night is this one thing that I can\u2019t seem to get during the day: it is dead quiet. Finally, the world is asleep and even a person who has trouble focusing in the face of distraction has a chance of getting something done. No more phone calls, screaming kids, traffic, airplanes and a hundred and one other sources of noise pollution. The only sound at night would be the clicking of my keyboard. I\u2019ve had single nights that were more productive than the weeks preceding them and I never made the link with the sound levels before. So, noise pollution may well be the root cause of my lack of daylight productivity rather than that \u201cI\u2019m a night person\u201d as I used to tell myself.\n I don\u2019t need to explain to you how disruptive this can be to your family life or you interaction with other businesses, if you are simply not alive during the day then the world will pass you by when they are awake, so in the end you may end up being awake both at night and during the day. The number of days that I\u2019ve gotten by on three hours of sleep (sometimes less\u2026) must number in the thousands by now. This sort of sleep depriviation is very hard to deal with, at some point the only way that you can fall asleep is because you are so exhausted it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore what the noise levels around you are. Contributing factor to all this was that I also have a serious jet-lag issue and that for many years I would travel back-and-forth between our offices in Toronto, Canada and IJmuiden, The Netherlands, a 6 hour time difference.\n Countless are the nights that I\u2019ve lain awake waiting for sleep to come, only to be greeted by the sunrise and birds chirping while still wide awake. It seemed impossible to break that cycle and still get something useful (writing, programming, practicing piano) done during the day and so I\u2019d give in again and live at night.\n This year, after reading the book I decided to finally make a break with this and it\u2019s been pretty hard, especially in the beginning. Here are the things I\u2019ve done to get my insomnia under control, and even though it is too early to declare a complete victory I do believe that the progress is substantial and I also believe that it is sustainable:\n Get up at 7:30, take one of my children to school. One of my children goes to school in a neighboring town and every day he cycles there. That\u2019s a pretty good distance with a couple of dangerous roads to cross so I ride with him which forces me to wake up at a regular time and to immediately do some exercise. After that I immediately go to work.\n Moved to a different room in the house where it is more quiet during the day. It\u2019s not a \u2018nice\u2019 spot by any means, it is sort of a lost space without windows or facilities but it has two advantages compared to where I sat before: it isn\u2019t in the regular path of moving around the house but a \u2018leaf node\u2019, if you don\u2019t need to be in this room you likely will not pass by or through (it is at the top of the building in the attic), the other advantage is that it is heavily insulated for heat which has the additional benefit of being insulated against traffic noise. Some still gets through though and when working on a hard problem or writing a hard text it is still far from perfect.\n Enforce a rhythm, divide the day into regular blocks that get repeated every day as much as possible. The start - as mentioned above - at around the same time every day helps but the end is just as important. The evenings I keep as boring as possible, no interesting projects, just practice music and read a book just before going to sleep, and go to sleep before 12 pm if at all possible (due to the nature of my work there are sometimes deadlines to be met and then I do have to work in the evening to be able to deliver on time).\n For a while I used  an online noise generator to mask sounds, my favorite was to use rain and distant thunder. Quite effective but in a way it makes the situation worse, now there is even more noise. So then I got some noise cancelling headphones. After reading many reviews I kept on coming back to the same brand which I had sworn to never buy another item of due to their disrespect of users\u2019 systems integrity, aka the \u2018rootkit debacle\u2019. But never is a very long time and even though the signal fuction of a boycott only shows up at the moment of change the cumulative effect of not buying this particular manufacturers stuff over that long a period of time meant that that money flowed to their competitors and if enough people do that then it should have a very distinct effect. Vote with your money, I guess. So much for principles I gues, I went and bought their product and I have to admit that their tech chops are undiminished after all these years, the product is excellent and works quite well. I\u2019m seriously impressed with how with the headphones on and noise cancelling enabled I can get work done during the day, even the sort of stuff that I would normally reserve for the night. Even a neighbor mowing their lawn or running a chainsaw does not disturb me and the biggest shock I get is when taking the headphones off to take a break from work and I realize just how noisy it is around me. The only major downside I\u2019ve discovered is that it is now very easy to creep up on me and to scare me in a terrible way (didn\u2019t take long for my kids to figure that one out ;) ), I\u2019m going to have to create some kind of early warning system for approaching people to solve that one.\n So, it all started with a book, and now, three months later my life is more regular than it has ever been in the last 40 years, I wake up well rested and fall asleep relatively easily, say within 30 minutes of wanting to sleep instead of many hours later. The noise cancelling tech is a key element in this story, and I sincerely hope that society will start to recognize the damaging effects of noise on people. Houses built right next to highways, motorcycles with ridiculously loud exhausts (or no exhausts at all\u2026), increasing local traffic, airplanes flying low over inhabited areas, industrial noise, appartments with walls so thin that you can hear the neighbors speak it all adds up and for some people it adds up to a life of misery severly impacting their ability to function normally. If you\u2019re studying for an exam, writing something hard or trying to solve a math or programming problem or anything else that requires your 100% concentration noise can really throw you off balance and may stop you from achieving your potential.\n For me it looks as though the problem is now mostly solved. The next step in technology, which I assume is very hard to solve for a whole pile of technical reasons would be to have a room that still has daylight and fresh air and yet is quiet. This can be achieved in part by using sound deadening materials and in part by using technology such as room sized noise cancelling devices. But in spite of a lot of interesting research projects my favorite noise black hole (\u2018sound sucker\u2019) does not exist yet, and maybe it never will.\n The present day solution is good enough to give me the daylight part of my life back though and for that I\u2019m very gratefull, both to Matthew Walker and the giver of the book to show me how serious the problem is and to the researchers and producers of noise cancelling technology, without whom I\u2019d still be awake most nights and feeling like a zombie during the day. Forty years of lost sleep is not something I\u2019ll ever be able to make up for, but at least I\u2019ll be getting my regular sleep and hopefully I\u2019ll be able to avoid further damage.",

"note_en": "The TIOBE monthly index of programming language popularity is a snapshot into the development world, and July&#39;s biggest surprise is the ranking of R.\n  A monthly index of popular programming languages found that statistical programming language R is quickly gaining on  Python, and several other languages have made significant jumps in popularity since the same time last year.\n Compiled by software QA automation company TIOBE, the monthly list  ranks programming languages by popularity based on the number of search engine hits each language returns. TIOBE states that the index &#34;is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written,&#34; only which is currently trending the highest on various search engines around the world.\n    The biggest surprise on the July index is the surge in popularity of the R programming language, which is commonly used in statistical and big data applications. R rose one space to eighth place in July, but its comparison to 2019 is where the real surprise lies: It was in 20th place at the same time last year.\n    Universities and research institutes have moved away from commercial statistical languages like SAS and Stata in favor of open source languages Python and R.\n    If Jansen&#39;s latter statement about R&#39;s increase is correct, developers may not want to immediately jump to learning R; its popularity could flounder if (and when) a  COVID-19 vaccine is found and data analytics levels return to normal, allowing Python to continue to up its lead as the most popular statistics programming language.\n TechRepublic sister site ZDNet reported that  the real reasons for R&#39;s jump in the rankings remains unclear, with even top R evangelists unsure that TIOBE&#39;s justifications are actually the case.\n Aside from confusion around R, the TIOBE index can serve as a great tool for developers. According to TIOBE, the index allows developers to &#34;check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system.&#34;\n  TIOBE compares the top 20 languages in its July 2020 index to its July 2019 index and the big movers are concentrated in the lower half of the 1-20 range. The top 10 languages remain fairly static with essentially no movement among the very top: C, Java, Python, C++, C#, Visual Basic, and JavaScript continue to be the most dominant.\n The latter 10 languages, on the other hand, have shifted significantly. The largest gainers in popularity between July 2019 and July 2020 are Go, which jumped from 16th to 12th place, Perl, jumping from No. 19 to No. 14, Scratch, jumping from No. 30 to No. 17, Rust, which moved from No. 33 to No. 18, and PL/SQL, which moved from No. 23 to No. 19.\n Ruby fell the most, moving from 11th place to 16th, while SQL, MATLAB, and Assembly Language also slipped down the list.\n From the hottest programming languages to the jobs with the highest salaries, get the developer news and tips you need to know.

"note_en": "Cor needs a type system. However, this will probably be in v2 because it turns out to a) be hard and b) we need types for:\n  Variable declarations hasn&#39;t had much discussion and Dave Mitchell&#39;s work on types for signatures predates Cor&#39;s attempts at declaring types, so it&#39;s not compatible.  I&#39;ve opened up a ticket on the Perl git repo about types. We absolutely can&#39;t have a type system for Cor which isn&#39;t integrated into the rest of the language.\n   Unfortunately, because data is &#34;typed&#34;, we tend to conflate types systems and data types. People often think that declaring an  Int or a  Str is what makes a type system. This is not true. For the purposes of this discussion, I&#39;ll borrow Benjamin C. Pierce&#39;s definition from his excellent book  Types and Programming Languages:\n A type system is a tractable syntactic method for proving the absense of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute.\n  A type system should be designed with the goal of ensuring the software cannot exhibit certain unwanted behaviors.\n So if we declare that a variable must contain an instance of a  DateTime object, assigning the string &#34;foo&#34; to it should throw an exception. Whether it should do so at compile-time or runtime is a subject of much debate and I&#39;ll largely skip that aside from mentioning that\u2014for Perl\u2014compile-time checks  should be preferred where doing so does not make our programming life harder. I&#39;m also a fan of gradual typing, so we get the benefit of quick coding to solve immediate problems, but we can fall back to more rigorous restrictions for large-scale systems as needed.\n That being said, let&#39;s consider  taint checking. Taint checking does a more than most developers realize, but the most common behavior is not using data from  outside your program to affect things  inside your program unless you&#39;ve &#34;scrubbed&#34; the outside data (obviously, this is a gross oversimplication). Otherwise, you&#39;ll get a failure. This happens at runtime:\n $\u00a0perl -TE &#39;my $arg = shift; say &#34;1. $arg&#34;; system($arg); say &#34;2. $arg&#34;&#39; foo1. fooInsecure $ENV{PATH} while running with -T switch at -e line 1.\n Thus, taint checking is a type system because there are certain unwanted behaviors which are avoided.\n Enabling strictures ( use strict) is enabling another type system that, amongst many other things, forces non-package variables to be predeclared in some way. This failure happens at compile-time:\n $\u00a0perl -Mstrict -E &#39;my @foo = (1,2); say &#34;Hello&#34;; say %foo&#39;Global symbol &#34;%foo&#34; requires explicit package name (did you forget to declare &#34;my %foo&#34;?) at -e line 1.Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.\n So Perl developers are quite happy with compile-type &#34;type&#34; failures, even if they don&#39;t always recognize that &#34;type&#34; means more than what is often thought of.\n So for Cor (and Perl in general), it&#39;s worth asking ourselves what kind of type system we need for the future.\n  These are drawn from the introduction of the &#34;Types and Programming Languages&#34; book previously mentioned. I&#39;ll use the Cor type syntax for examples.\n    class  Point:  def  __init__( self,  x,  y):  self. x  =  x  self. y  =  y  def  inverse( self):  return  Point( self. y, self. x) point  =  Point( 7, 3.2). inverse() print( point. x) point. x  =  &#34;foo&#34; print( point. x)\n That prints &#34;3.2&#34; and the &#34;foo&#34;. In Python, it&#39;s considered &#34;unpythonic&#34; to validate the data. When faced with a million line codebase, you&#39;re supposed to just  know all of your classes. This is not good.\n  package  Point {  sub  new {  my (  $class,  $x,  $y ) =  @_;  return  bless {  x  =&gt;  $x,  y  =&gt;  $y }  =&gt;  $class; }  sub  x {  my  $self =  shift;  if ( @_) {  $self -&gt;{ x} =  shift; }  return  $self -&gt;{ x}; }  sub  y {  my  $self =  shift;  if ( @_) {  $self -&gt;{ y} =  shift; }  return  $self -&gt;{ y}; }  sub  inverse {  my  $self =  shift;  return Point -&gt;new(  $self -&gt; y,  $self -&gt;x ); }}\n Fortunately, developers have gotten tired of the related bugs because the code should protect programmers where it can. In Cor, that would be something like this:\n class Point { has (  $x,  $y ) :reader :writer :new :isa(Num); method invert () {  return Point -&gt;new(  x  =&gt;  $y,  y  =&gt;  $x ); }}\n If you tried to assign the string &#34;foo&#34; to  x or  y, you&#39;d get an exception.\n   What should be the &#34;safety&#34; here? Should you get -3.5? That&#39;s what standard Perl would do because it tries not to throw away information. For some languages, that would return -3 or -4, both arguably wrong. For a type system in Perl, I would suggest that we get an exception (or at least a warning) there. I don&#39;t want the float silently converted to an integer, nor do I want the type to change.\n   Do we  coerce that to an integer? Unfortunately, yes, because of  context. But if we&#39;re talking about the return value of a function, that&#39;s more complicated:\n sub  list {  return ( 2, 4, 6 );} sub  array {  my  @array = ( 2, 4, 6 );  return  @array;} my  $list = list(); my  $array = array(); say  $list; say  $array;\n The  say $list prints  6 and the  say $array prints  3. This is due to a weird combination of context with lists and arrays (which are containers for lists, though this container has a nasty habit of handing you a naked list and running away).\n How do you design a system for type safety in the face of that without gutting context?\n Retrofitting a type system on a language that&#39;s not explicitly designed for one is filled with pitfalls.\n    In the above, we can read our code and get a reasonable idea about the kinds of data we need. Unlike  POD or other forms of &#34;documentation&#34;, this documentation cannot get out of sync with the program because it  is the program. Further, tools such as  javadoc can produce huge amounts of genuinely useful documentation in a variety of formats just by reading this information. It would be lovely if a future version of  perldoc could take advantage of this.\n  Type systems can often guarantee various kinds of safety in programming. Perl&#39;s &#34;taint mode&#34; is one such type system. However, array bounds checking is another. The C language, for example, expects you to check the array boundaries yourself. Other languages can throw an &#34;out of bounds&#34; exception at compile-time (harder than it sounds) or runtime and Perl simply resizes the array on the fly to avoid overflow errors.\n There are other types of safety would could achieve, though. Imagine a  Secret[] modifier (this example is not proposed seriously):\n  Now, wherever  $password is printed, the resulting string would be  hunter2. Stack trace? They&#39;d see  hunter2. Printed at the command line?  hunter2? Interpolated in a string?  hunter2.\n In Cor, if you declared a class as  Secret, that might effectively add a method like the following:\n  Any attempt to override that in a subclass or with a role would be fatal.\n Maybe we could go further by  preventing that data from being written to swap? Automatically clearing that memory when the variable goes out of scope? There are all sorts of &#34;safe&#34; things you can do with a decent type system.\n But how would get the original information in a secure way? Let&#39;s say you need to salt it, run blowfish over that, and save the results to the database. If you make  Secret[]  too secure, it&#39;s unusable. But if you make it too usable, it&#39;s not secure. And knowing the fun tricks I can play with namespaces in Perl, I suspect that most na\u00efve schemes to &#34;protect&#34; the data would fail. Still, this is exactly the sort of safety a decent type system can improve (though not guarantee).\n  This one might take more time, but it&#39;s a clear goal to strive for. If I declare a type to be an integer, there&#39;s a lot of internal stuff that Perl would no longer need to store in the scalar. Or at the very least, it would always return a valid value from the IV slot and never check another slot in the scalar. However, I expect that the first implementations would actually  slow down Perl because hey, you gotta check the type! Offering some way of turning off the type checking after exhaustive testing and then shipping into production would be a bad idea, but someone&#39;s going to propose it.\n  In the original version of C (before it was even released),  the only types were integers, characters, and arrays of integers and characters and pointers to them. Types were not really there to help the human; they were to help the computer. However, with the advent of OO systems, you could declare something to be an instance of a class. Thus, the type systems became a bit more human-friendly because the types matched the programmer&#39;s needs, not just the computer&#39;s needs, though we had things like this:\n     Cor should also be &#34;human-friendly&#34;, though it&#39;s unclear to me the best way to implement that. We could possibly implement a form of generics:\n  That would assign to  $your_bike the type it gets, but it&#39;s unclear to me what that gains us over leaving the type annotation off.\n   But I expect many Perl developers would be unhappy with that and I&#39;m one of them. I&#39;ve tried very hard to limit adding new syntax to the language. Suggestions welcome on how we can improve typing without creating an overly verbose language.\n However, we have many cases were our types are  almost good enough, but not quite. What if I want an integer, but it must be greater than a given number? That&#39;s where we steal  where from Raku:\n  Again, we get a more expressive type system that&#39;s geared to what humans need and not what computers need. Sure, we  could implement a  MinimumAge class, but that&#39;s overkill for many situations.\n    Do we want to have generics on Cor? At first glance, we can simply omit the types. I&#39;ve looked at various examples and so long as the data we&#39;re passing to something is typed, omitting the type annotations seems enough.

"note_en": "COVID-19 is changing the way we dine out, but how such changes will transform the experience in the years ahead remains an open question. One thing we do know is that restaurants change over time. There\u2019s a history to them. And historian Paul Freedman has been reading the  menus from the dawn of the American restaurant.\n \u201cMenus,\u201d Freedman writes, \u201coffer a glimpse of how a well-off but socially uncertain elite sought to express culinary discrimination in the quasi-public setting of the restaurant, a French invention of the mid- to late-eighteenth century that did not take hold in the United States and Great Britain until well into the nineteenth.\u201d\n    Freedman looked at menus from eighty-five American restaurants that existed between 1838\u2014\u201cthe date of the first extant menu from Delmonico\u2019s, generally considered to be the country\u2019s first fine restaurant\u201d\u2014and 1865. In addition to the cuisine, he explains what we know about early dining out.\n For one thing, it was fashionable for European visitors to complain about American food. Famous visitors like Frances Trollope groused that it was \u201cabundant but not delicate\u201d in 1832. Ten years later, Charles Dickens\u2019s first trip to America was \u201ca culinary disaster.\u201d\n Americans were also renowned for eating with great speed: Delmonico\u2019s scheduled an average of eight to ten minutes per course for their fourteen-course meal. Dinner was served from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Food could still be had later in the evening, but choices were more limited.\n  It was unusual for men and women to dine together in early restaurants. \u201cUnescorted\u201d women were not generally allowed until the invention of the \u201cladies ordinary\u201d in 1839. This was a separate dining space for women; in smaller establishments, it could be a separate table instead of a room.\n Fancy dining was initially hotel dining\u2014the \u201cAmerican plan\u201d of hotel pricing included food. The European plan, charging separately for meals, was slowly adopted after 1844.  \u00a0Delmonico\u2019s in New York and Antonine\u2019s in New Orleans were the pioneers as stand-alone restaurant businesses. Service in American restaurants was \u201ca la russe\u201d\u2014Russian style. Waiters, who were all male, brought courses in succession. This style was taken up earlier by Americans than by Europeans.\n \u201cDecades before the Gilded Age,\u201d writes Freedman, Americans \u201cdemonstrated an extravagant, if to us somewhat alien, set of food preferences, preferences emblazoned on the period\u2019s menus, a surprising number of which have survived.\u201d\n Macaroni au gratin, fricassee of chicken, baked beans and pork, macaroni a l\u2019italienne, and oyster patties were the five most common menu items in Freedman\u2019s survey. Macaroni, often in some variation of mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese, was a staple of high-end dining.\u00a0The distinctly American dishes of the day were canvasback duck and terrapin.\n \u201cCuisine is, of course, notoriously resistant to objective measures of quality,\u201d writes Freedman, and \u201cmany of our forebears\u2019 food choices will strike us as less than congenial.\u201d\n  You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\n  Freedman\u2019s appendix lists 928 entrees served at New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue Hotel between 1859 and 1865. Nine variations on calf\u2019s head. Fillet of beef and fish, but also chicken, duck, goose, green turtle, grouse, lamb, mutton, pigeon, pork, veal, and venison. Almost all of those meats could also be found hashed. Fried eel and six variations of frog, including \u201cfried English style.\u201d If you hungered for lamb fries (which are testicles), there were at least five ways they could be prepared. Many wild birds were on the menu, including plover with Champagne sauce, snipe in cases, and rice birds with toast. For the nose-to-tail crowd, there were thirteen different tripe preparations.\n This abundance, which would only expand in the Gilded Age\u2019s orgies of soup-to-nuts dining, seems to have been the name of the game even before the Civil War. \u00a0And that\u2019s no load of tripe.\n        JSTOR is a digital library for scholars, researchers, and students.
