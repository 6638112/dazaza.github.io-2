Some quit. Others were fired. All were Black.</p><p>旧金山—他们一一离开。有些退出了。其他被解雇了。所有人都是黑人。</p><p> The 15 people  worked at Coinbase, the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency start-up, where they represented roughly three-quarters of the Black employees at the 600-person company. Before leaving in late 2018 and early 2019, at least 11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment, five people with knowledge of the situation said.</p><p> 这15名员工在美国最有价值的加密货币初创公司Coinbase工作，代表着600名员工中约四分之三的黑人员工。五名了解情况的人士称，在2018年末和2019年初离开之前，至少有11人告知人力资源部或其经理他们所说的种族主义或歧视性待遇。</p><p> One of the employees was Alysa Butler, 25, who worked in recruiting. During her time at Coinbase, she said, she told her manager several times about how he and others excluded her from meetings and conversations, making her feel invisible.</p><p> 其中一名员工是25岁的艾莉莎·巴特勒（Alysa Butler），他从事招聘工作。她说，在Coinbase工作期间，她多次告诉经理，他和其他人如何将她排除在会议和对话之外，使她感到自己看不见。</p><p> “Most people of color working in tech know that there’s a diversity problem,” said Ms. Butler, who resigned in April 2019. “But I’ve never experienced anything like Coinbase.”</p><p> 在2019年4月辞职的巴特勒女士说：“大多数从事技术工作的有色人种都知道存在多样性问题。但是我从未经历过像Coinbase这样的事情。”</p><p> In Silicon Valley, where entrepreneurs and investors often  preach high-minded missions and style themselves as management gurus, Coinbase has held itself up as a model. Since the start-up was founded in 2012, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive, has assembled  memos and  blog  posts about how he built the $8 billion company’s culture with distinct hiring and training practices. That has won him acclaim among influential venture capitalists and executives.</p><p> 在硅谷，企业家和投资者经常鼓吹高尚的使命，并把自己打扮成管理大师，Coinbase一直保持榜样。自从这家初创公司成立于2012年以来，首席执行官布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗（Brian Armstrong）收集了一些备忘和博客文章，介绍了他如何通过独特的雇用和培训实践来打造这家市值80亿美元的公司的文化。那赢得了他在有影响力的风险资本家和高管中的好评。</p><p> But according to 23 current and former Coinbase employees, five of whom spoke on the record, as well as internal documents and recordings of conversations, the start-up has long struggled with its management of Black employees.</p><p> 但是根据23位Coinbase的现任和前任员工（其中有5位记录在案，以及内部文件和对话记录），这家初创企业长期以来一直在努力管理黑人员工。</p><p> One Black employee said her manager suggested in front of colleagues that she was dealing drugs and carrying a gun, trading on racist stereotypes. Another said a co-worker at a recruiting meeting broadly described Black employees as less capable. Still another said managers spoke down to her and her Black colleagues, adding that they were passed over for promotions in favor of less experienced white employees. The accumulation of incidents, they said, led to the wave of departures.</p><p> 一名黑人雇员说，她的经理在同事面前建议她正在贩毒，手持枪支，以种族主义定型观念交易。另一位员工说，在一次招聘会议上，一位同事将黑人雇员描述为能力较弱。另一位经理说，经理们对她和她的黑人同事不屑一顾，并补充说，他们被晋升为低薪的白人雇员。他们说，事件的累积导致了离港潮。</p><p> “It was the first time I realized what racism felt like in the modern world,” said Layllen Sawyerr, a compliance analyst who is Black. “I felt like I was being bullied every day at work.” She said she filed a discrimination complaint with Coinbase’s legal department before quitting in 2018.</p><p>布莱克（Black）的合规分析师Layllen Sawyerr说：“这是我第一次意识到种族主义在现代世界中的感觉。” “我觉得我每天在工作中被欺负。”她说，她在2018年辞职之前向Coinbase的法律部门提出了歧视投诉。</p><p> Kim Milosevich, a Coinbase spokeswoman, said the company “does not tolerate racial, gender or any other forms of discrimination.”</p><p> Coinbase发言人金·米洛舍维奇（Kim Milosevich）表示，该公司“不容忍种族，性别或任何其他形式的歧视。”</p><p> She added, “All claims of discrimination are treated very seriously, investigated by both internal and third parties, and the appropriate action is taken.”</p><p> 她补充说：“对所有歧视的主张都得到了非常认真的对待，内部和第三方均对此进行了调查，并采取了适当的行动。”</p><p> Ms. Milosevich said Coinbase had a record of only three official complaints from the 2018-19 period and none from Ms. Butler. Ms. Milosevich said the three complaints, including Ms. Sawyerr’s, were investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. Ms. Butler said she was not told how to make an official complaint;  Ms. Sawyerr said she never spoke to an investigator and was not informed of the findings.</p><p> 米洛舍维奇女士说，Coinbase在2018-19年度期间仅记录了三起官方投诉，而巴特勒女士则没有。米洛舍维奇女士说，包括索耶女士在内的三项投诉都经过了调查，没有根据。巴特勒女士说，她没有被告知如何提出正式申诉。索耶女士说，她从未与调查人员交谈，也没有得知调查结果。</p><p> On Wednesday, before publication of this article, Emilie Choi, Coinbase’s chief operating officer, wrote an email to employees to preemptively question the article’s accuracy and said,  “We know the story will recount episodes that will be difficult for employees to read.” The company  posted the email to its public blog.</p><p> 周三，在这篇文章发表之前，Coinbase的首席运营官埃米莉·崔（Emilie Choi）给员工写了一封电子邮件，以抢先地质疑该文章的准确性，并说：“我们知道这个故事将重新叙述员工难以阅读的情节。”该公司将该电子邮件发布到其公共博客。</p><p> Tech companies have long  struggled to hire and support Black employees and entrepreneurs. Just 1 percent of venture-backed companies were led by Black entrepreneurs from 2013 to 2018, according to a  study by RateMyInvestor, which analyzes tech investors. Large tech companies like Intel, Google and Facebook have publicly said that they need to do better on diversity and have  committed to improvements, though progress has been uneven.</p><p> 长期以来，科技公司一直在努力雇用和支持黑人雇员和企业家。根据RateMyInvestor的一项研究，该报告分析了技术投资者，从2013年到2018年，只有1％的风险投资公司由黑人企业家领导。英特尔，谷歌和Facebook等大型科技公司已公开表示，尽管进展不平衡，但他们需要在多样性方面做得更好，并致力于改善。</p><p> But even in this environment, Coinbase stands out, said the current and former employees, some of whom requested anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements or feared retaliation. Three percent of the company’s employees are Black, which is less than half the average in most of the tech industry, according to the  latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Coinbase’s percentage has also stayed flat in recent years, while companies such as  Square,  PayPal and  Twitter  have modestly increased their share of Black employees.</p><p> 但是，即使在这种环境下，Coinbase的现任和前任雇员也脱颖而出，其中一些人要求匿名，因为他们已经签署了保密协议或担心遭到报复。根据美国劳工统计局的最新数据，黑人雇员占公司的3％，不到大多数科技行业平均水平的一半。近年来，Coinbase的比例也保持稳定，而Square，PayPal和Twitter等公司则适度增加了其黑人员工的份额。</p><p> “If the numbers haven’t changed, it’s definitely because there wasn’t a real intention to do so,” Cleve Mesidor, the founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, said of Coinbase, which she has worked with to hold events in the Black engineering community. “We know now that Brian Armstrong was never committed to this.”</p><p>“如果数字没有变化，那肯定是因为没有真正的意图，”国家区块链有色女性政策网络的创始人克利夫·梅西多（Cleve Mesidor）谈到与Coinbase合作时说。在Black工程社区举行活动。 “我们现在知道布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗从未致力于这一工作。”</p><p>  The tensions at Coinbase came to a head in June, after the  police killing of George Floyd. As many tech leaders publicly voiced support for Black Lives Matter protests, Black employees at Coinbase said on the Slack messaging platform that they were hurt by the silence of Mr. Armstrong and other executives about the matter. They organized a meeting where several of them told executives, often through tears, about their difficult experiences at the company, eight people who attended said.</p><p>  警方杀害乔治·弗洛伊德（George Floyd）之后，6月，Coinbase的紧张局势达到了顶点。当许多技术领导人公开表示支持“ Black Lives Matter”抗议活动时，Coinbase的Black员工在Slack消息平台上表示，阿姆斯特朗和其他高管对此事保持沉默的做法令他们受到伤害。他们组织了一次会议，其中有几人经常流泪告诉高管他们在公司的艰难经历，八名与会人员表示。</p><p> The next day, Mr. Armstrong, 37, summarized the tone of what he had heard. “There was just this outpouring of, like, Why does the company not have my back?” he said at a staff meeting, according to a recording of the session shared with The New York Times. In a company email he sent later, which was also shared with The Times, he agreed to revamp the diversity-and-inclusion plan and increase mentoring.</p><p> 第二天，现年37岁的阿姆斯特朗先生总结了他所听到的声音。 “就像这样，公司为什么没有我的支持呢？”根据与《纽约时报》分享的会议记录，他在一次员工会议上说。在他后来发送的公司电子邮件中（也与《泰晤士报》共享），他同意修改多样性和包容性计划并增加指导。</p><p> But in September, Mr. Armstrong published a  public blog post telling employees to leave concerns for issues like racial justice at the door. He said that while the company embraced diversity, the staff needed to focus on Coinbase’s mission of profit and advancing cryptocurrencies. They should resign if they did not agree, he said.</p><p> 但在9月，阿姆斯特朗（Armstrong）先生发表了一篇公共博客文章，告诉员工不要把诸如种族正义之类的问题留在门外。他说，在公司拥护多样性的同时，员工需要专注于Coinbase的盈利使命和推动加密货币发展。他说，如果他们不同意，他们应该辞职。</p><p> “We don’t engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission,” Mr. Armstrong wrote.</p><p> 阿姆斯特朗写道：“当问题与我们的核心使命无关时，我们不在这里。”</p><p> The post drew immediate blowback from employees. “Why stay and put effort into this work if it’s just tokenized into recruiting points and not actually improving the sense of belonging and psychological safety,” Lauren Lee, who was responsible for diversity and inclusion, wrote in a Slack message that was viewed by The Times.</p><p> 该职位立即引起了员工的反响。 “为什么要留下来并努力工作，如果只是将其标记为招聘要点而没有真正改善归属感和心理安全感，”负责多元化和包容性的劳伦•李（Lauren Lee）在Slack消息中写道，时间。</p><p> Ms. Lee, who did not respond to requests for comment, resigned last month. So have at least 60 others.</p><p> 未回应置评请求的李女士上个月辞职。因此，至少还有60个人。</p><p>  Mr. Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader, founded Coinbase eight years ago to provide a place to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. They built the start-up into a cryptocurrency leader, making money by taking fees on trades placed by its customers. (Mr. Ehrsam left day-to-day operations in 2017.)</p><p>前Airbnb工程师Armstrong先生和前高盛交易员Fred Ehrsam先生八年前成立了Coinbase，以提供买卖加密货币的场所。他们将初创公司打造成为了加密货币领导者，通过收取客户交易费用来赚钱。 （Ehrsam先生于2017年离职。）</p><p> Today, Coinbase is riding a new wave of interest in cryptocurrencies, with the value of  the virtual currency Bitcoin approaching a new high as investors increasingly treat it like an alternative to gold.</p><p> 如今，Coinbase对加密货币产生了新的兴趣，随着投资者越来越将其视为黄金的替代品，虚拟货币比特币的价值接近新高。</p><p> Much of Coinbase’s culture stems from the one around Bitcoin, current and former employees said. Bitcoin, which embodies a libertarian philosophy that snubs its nose at the pieties of mainstream institutions, has attracted a generation of fans known as  “crypto bros.” Many have propagated a brash male-dominated way of life, facing criticism for sowing  racism and  sexism.</p><p> 现任和前任雇员表示，Coinbase的文化大部分来自围绕比特币的文化。比特币体现了一种自由主义者的哲学，对主流机构的虔诚不屑一顾，它吸引了一代被称为“加密兄弟”的粉丝。许多人传播了一种以男性为主导的傲慢生活方式，因播种种族主义和性别歧视而面临批评。</p><p> At Coinbase, Mr. Armstrong, who eschewed some of Bitcoin’s most renegade elements, began building what he called an “all star” culture, with mostly young white and Asian men. In  one 2018 post on “36 Ways to Hire, Develop and Retain Great People,” he wrote about the importance of creating a “consistent culture” and the value of acting like  an “all-star team” instead of a “family.”</p><p> 放弃了比特币最叛逆的一些元素的阿姆斯特朗在Coinbase上开始建立他所谓的“全明星”文化，其中大多数是白人和亚裔男性。他在2018年发表的一篇“雇用，发展和留住伟人的36种方法”的文章中谈到创造一种“一致的文化”的重要性以及像“全明星团队”而不是“家庭”那样工作的价值。</p><p> “Players who don’t contribute or work as a team get cut,” he wrote.</p><p> 他写道：“没有贡献或没有团队精神的球员会被削减。”</p><p> Ruby Bhattacharya, a recruiter at Coinbase in 2017, said the search for employees for this “consistent culture” often meant looking for people who resembled the other staff. Ms. Bhattacharya, who is gay and was born in England to Indian parents, said her colleagues made it clear she did not belong.</p><p> 2017年，Coinbase的招聘人员Ruby Bhattacharya表示，寻找这种“一致的文化”的员工通常意味着寻找与其他员工相似的人。 Bhattacharya女士是男同性恋，在英国由印度父母出生。她说，她的同事明确表示她不属于。</p><p> “I was told I don’t have the right brain for this,” she said. “It was constant condescension.”</p><p> 她说：“有人告诉我我没有合适的大脑。” “这是不断的屈尊。”</p><p>  As Coinbase grew, several female executives lobbied for more diversity, three former employees said. The company had brought on about a dozen Black employees by the beginning of 2018, when it had a staff of around 300.</p><p>三名前雇员说，随着Coinbase的发展，几位女性高管游说以增加多样性。到2018年初，该公司已拥有约300名员工，吸引了大约12名黑人员工。</p><p> One of those hires was Katherine Johnson, who led the compliance department. She helped recruit seven more people of color, said Ms. Sawyerr, who was among those who joined.</p><p> 其中一名员工是负责合规部门的Katherine Johnson。参加活动的人之一索耶说，她帮助招募了七个有色人种。</p><p> But Ms. Sawyerr and others said they soon felt like they were being treated differently. On days when reporters or photographers came in, they said, they were told to be present so they could be in the photos to display the company’s diversity. But in meetings, they were talked down to and ignored. By mid-2018, some said they had started talking to human resources and their managers about the behavior.</p><p> 但是索耶女士和其他人说，他们很快就觉得自己受到了不同待遇。他们说，在记者或摄影师进来的日子里，他们被告知要在场，以便可以在照片中展示公司的多样性。但是在会议上，他们被拒绝并被忽略。到2018年年中，有人说他们已经开始与人力资源部门及其经理讨论这种行为。</p><p> When Coinbase announced it would be opening an office in Portland, Ore., several Black employees in the compliance department who worked remotely were told to move there or reapply for new jobs, four former employees said. The company said it wanted the whole team in one place, but current and former employees said the one white employee in the department was allowed to continue working remotely.</p><p> 四名前员工说，当Coinbase宣布将在俄勒冈州波特兰开设办事处时，法规遵从部门的几名黑人员工被远程调动到那里或重新申请新工作。该公司表示，希望整个团队集中在一个地方，但是现任和前任雇员表示，该部门的一名白人雇员被允许继续远程工作。</p><p> Ms. Milosevich said the white employee lived in Philadelphia and was allowed to commute to and work from the company’s New York office. She said all of the workers were offered relocation packages and that some who declined to move received severance.</p><p> 米洛舍维奇女士说，这名白人雇员住在费城，被允许往返公司的纽约办事处并在该公司的办公室工作。她说，向所有工人提供了搬迁包裹，一些拒绝搬迁的工人得到了遣散费。</p><p> All of the Black workers in the compliance division ended up among the group of 15 who left. Ms. Johnson, who was described as a supportive manager, declined to comment. She left Coinbase last year.</p><p> 合规部门的所有黑人工人最终都离开了15人的行列。被描述为支持经理的约翰逊女士拒绝置评。她去年离开了Coinbase。</p><p> In mid-2018, Coinbase hired Tariq Meyers, who had worked on inclusion efforts at the ride-hailing company Lyft, to lead a diversity push. Ciceli Johnson-Porter, who worked on Coinbase’s legal team, said she had approached Mr. Meyers several times to discuss the way her managers repeatedly diminished her and favored her white colleagues. She said he tried to help but was not empowered to change anything.</p><p> 在2018年中，Coinbase聘请了在打车公司Lyft从事包容性工作的Tariq Meyers领导了多元化发展。在Coinbase法律团队工作的Ciceli Johnson-Porter说，她已经多次与Meyers先生会面，讨论她的经理们反复贬低她并偏爱白人同事的方式。她说他试图提供帮助，但无权更改任何内容。</p><p> “He knew he was there to put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” she said. Mr. Meyers, who left Coinbase in June, declined to comment.</p><p>她说：“他知道他在那里把创可贴放在子弹伤口上，” Meyers先生于6月离开Coinbase，他拒绝置评。</p><p> Ms. Johnson-Porter, who resigned last year, said Coinbase often turned its scrutiny on the person who complained. After she spoke up, she said, her boss started taking issue with her work. “Those of us who were vocal about the unfair treatment — they either pushed you out or created an issue that wasn’t an issue to force you out,” she said.</p><p> 去年辞职的约翰逊-波特女士说，Coinbase经常对投诉人进行审查。她说完话后，老板开始对她的工作提出质疑。她说：“我们当中有人大声疾呼不公平的待遇，他们要么把你赶出去，要么制造了一个不是迫使你退出的问题。”</p><p> Ms. Milosevich said the company investigated Ms. Johnson-Porter’s claims and found “no evidence of unfairness or wrongdoing.”</p><p> 米洛舍维奇女士说，该公司调查了约翰逊-波特女士的主张，并发现“没有证据表明存在不公平或不当行为。”</p><p>  Early last year, some workers brought the exodus of Black employees to the attention of Mr. Armstrong and asked him to step in, three people briefed on the situation said. He listened and said he would think about it, but took no action, they said.</p><p>  三名了解情况的人士说，去年年初，一些工人将黑人雇员的撤职引起了阿姆斯特朗先生的注意，并要求他介入。他们说，他听了并且说他会考虑的，但是没有采取任何行动。</p><p> Mr. Armstrong rarely spoke or made decisions in meetings, the current and former employees said, leaving them uncertain about his opinions. In a staff meeting this summer, he said he knew his style made many employees uncomfortable and attributed it to being “on the spectrum,” according to a recording of the event.</p><p> 现任和前任雇员表示，阿姆斯特朗先生很少在会议上讲话或做出决定，这使他们不确定他的观点。根据该活动的记录，他在今年夏天的一次员工会议上说，他知道自己的风格使许多员工感到不舒服，并将其归因于“大范围”。</p><p> Ms. Sawyerr said she had talked with four other Black employees about bringing a discrimination lawsuit against Coinbase, but the others backed out after being offered hefty severance payments in exchange for confidentiality agreements.</p><p> 索耶女士说，她已经与另外四名黑人雇员讨论了对Coinbase提起歧视诉讼，但是其他人在获得了高额遣散费以换取保密协议后退出。</p><p> By the end of 2019, 31 of Coinbase’s 1,000 employees were Black. That proportion has remained unchanged.</p><p> 到2019年底，Coinbase的1,000名员工中有31名是黑人。该比例保持不变。</p><p>  When Mr. Armstrong wrote his blog post in September asking employees to leave their outside interests at the door, he was  celebrated and praised by several tech investors.</p><p>9月，阿姆斯特朗（Armstrong）撰写博客文章，要求员工将外部利益放在门外，他受到了几位科技投资者的赞扬和称赞。</p><p> Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, and one of the nine members of Coinbase’s board,  said that many tech chief executives “would like to have done what Brian did” to reduce the distractions that come from employee activism. David Sacks, a PayPal founder,  said Mr. Armstrong’s post was “how you build a movement and change the world.”</p><p> 联合广场创投公司（Union Square Ventures）的风险资本家弗雷德·威尔逊（Fred Wilson）是Coinbase董事会的九名成员之一，他说，许多技术首席执行官“愿意做布莱恩所做的事情”，以减少员工积极性引起的干扰。贝宝（PayPal）创始人戴维·萨克斯（David Sacks）说，阿姆斯特朗先生的帖子是“如何建立运动并改变世界”。</p><p>  But internally, Mr. Armstrong’s post led to another exodus. Besides Ms. Lee, another employee who left in October was John Russ, the head of marketing and the company’s highest ranking Black employee, who had been hired three months earlier.</p><p>  但在内部，阿姆斯特朗先生的职位导致了另一次外流。除李女士外，另一位10月份离职的员工是营销主管约翰·拉斯（John Russ），该公司是黑人员工中最高的，他在三个月前被雇用。</p><p> In a brief phone interview, Mr. Russ would only say that he disagreed with Mr. Armstrong’s new position and left as a result.</p><p> 在简短的电话采访中，拉斯先生只会说他不同意阿姆斯特朗的新职位，结果离开了。</p><p> On Oct. 8, Mr. Armstrong wrote in a  letter to employees that 60 people had left Coinbase. He said he took solace in how many Black employees had chosen to stay.</p><p> 10月8日，阿姆斯特朗先生在给员工的信中写道，有60人离开了Coinbase。他说，他对多少黑人雇员选择留下来表示慰问。</p><p> In response, one Black employee wrote on Slack that her continued employment should not be “reassuring.” She said that she and many other Black employees were in low-ranking support positions, and that it was hard to leave at a moment of high unemployment in the pandemic, according to a copy of the message seen by The Times.
