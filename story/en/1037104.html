But I suppose that has now morphed into a more public letter.</p><p>碰巧的是，我决定本周末想写信给我的导师托尼，感谢他给我的生活带来的巨大影响。但是我想这现在变成了一封更加公开的信。</p><p> Being in a zombie, half blurry-eyed state, it’s a little tough to articulate well what Tony has meant to me. We go through life, and a lot of people have an impact on us, and it’s often hard to say that a particular person caused you to take a particular path. But, Tony is one of the few people whom I can definitely say my life would not at all be what it is without him.</p><p> 处于僵尸，半昏眼的状态，很难清楚地表达托尼对我的含义。我们经历了人生，很多人都对我们产生影响，通常很难说一个特定的人使您走了一条特定的道路。但是，托尼是为数不多的人之一，我绝对可以说，没有他，我的生活根本不会变成这样。</p><p> I first met him many years ago in Dec 1996 when I was just starting high school. My best friend Jennifer asked me what I was doing for winter break and if I wanted to help out her cousin Tony with his new internet startup. I had no idea what an internet startup was, but I had nothing going on, so I agreed to go.</p><p> 多年前，1996年12月，我刚上高中的时候，我第一次见到他。我最好的朋友詹妮弗（Jennifer）问我寒假时我在做什么，以及我是否想与他的堂兄托尼（Tony）一起创办新的互联网创业公司。我不知道互联网初创公司是什么，但是我什么也没做，所以我同意了。</p><p> On the first day of our holiday break, Jennifer and I hopped on the Caltrain from the peninsula (Silicon Valley) to head to his office in SOMA (San Francisco). It was exciting! We couldn’t drive, but we could go to a startup office all by ourselves! I followed Jennifer to the address. I think their office was actually someone’s apartment. And when we got there, there seemingly was no one there. We hung around for a while, and maybe about 10am or so some people started to trickle in – this was my introduction to startup life.</p><p> 在我们放假的第一天，我和詹妮弗（Jennifer）从半岛（硅谷）跳上Caltrain，直奔他在SOMA（旧金山）的办公室。太刺激了！我们不会开车，但是我们可以一个人去创业公司！我跟随詹妮弗到地址。我认为他们的办公室实际上是某人的公寓。当我们到达那里时，似乎没有人在那里。我们闲逛了一段时间，也许大约在上午10点左右，有些人开始涉足其中-这是我对创业生活的介绍。</p><p> Tony had more or less just graduated from Harvard, as he had spent a few short months at Oracle after graduation, and then decided to quit to build his own company LinkExchange. Leaving a big employer so quickly was highly unusual back then, and he would go on to do many non-conforming things that he was right about.</p><p> 托尼或多或少刚从哈佛毕业，因为他毕业后在甲骨文工作了短短几个月，然后决定辞职建立自己的公司LinkExchange。这么快就离开一个大老板是很不寻常的，他会继续做很多他认为正确的不合格的事情。</p><p> LinkExchange was an ad network. If you had a website and hosted LinkExchange ad banners, for every 2 impressions you generated, you received 1 free impression of your banner. Back then because the internet was still new, people paid attention to banners and clicked on them like crazy, so this was incredibly effective in helping generate traffic for people. LinkExchange would then sell the remaining ad impressions. They had launched the service earlier that year, and by that December, they were already growing like crazy.</p><p> LinkExchange是一个广告网络。如果您拥有一个网站并托管LinkExchange广告横幅，则每产生2次展示，您就可以免费获得1次横幅展示。那时，由于互联网还很新，人们注意到了标语，然后疯狂地点击了标语，因此这在帮助产生流量方面非常有效。然后，LinkExchange将出售剩余的广告展示次数。他们在当年早些时候推出了该服务，到了12月，他们已经变得疯狂起来。</p><p> I definitely was *not helpful*. We put together some tables and chairs. And made ethernet cables from scratch. Yes, from scratch. We had to cut cables, splice the individual wires, and insert them into plastic tips and crimp them. I was terrible at this, and Jennifer largely fixed all of my mistakes (as always). Since I was so bad at the ethernet cable making process, they asked me to help them put together an internal webpage to keep all their meetings / schedule together. Great! I could put my basic HTML skills to use. I don’t think they liked the amateurish turquoise background that I chose, so someone at LinkExchange quickly fixed it.</p><p> 我绝对*没有帮助*。我们整理了一些桌子和椅子。并从头开始制作以太网电缆。是的，从头开始。我们必须剪裁电缆，将单根导线拼接起来，然后将其插入塑料尖端并压接它们。我对此感到很糟糕，詹妮弗（一如既往）在很大程度上纠正了我的所有错误。由于我对以太网电缆的制作过程非常不满意，他们要求我帮助他们建立一个内部网页，以使所有会议/日程安排在一起。大！我可以使用我的基本HTML技能。我认为他们不喜欢我选择的业余绿松石背景，因此LinkExchange的某人很快对其进行了修复。</p><p> I was more of a nuisance than help, but what I saw that day was super inspiring. Here were a bunch of friends who were getting together to build things. They could wear whatever they wanted, saunter in whenever they wanted, and eat all the pizza they wanted. And they all had varied tasks and were taking business meetings in what looked like a kitchen? There was never a dull moment. It was the dream. Neither of my parents worked in tech and certainly not startups, so this was incredibly eye-opening, and immediately, I knew that this was what I was going to do when I grew up – become an entrepreneur and start companies. Without this exposure to startups in 1996, I don’t think I would have made this realization (if at all) for many years.</p><p>我更多的是烦恼而不是帮助，但是那天我看到的是超级鼓舞人心的。这是一群聚集在一起建造东西的朋友。他们可以随便穿什么，随时随地逛逛，吃他们想要的所有披萨。他们都承担着各种各样的任务，并正在看起来像厨房的地方举行商务会议？从来没有一个沉闷的时刻。那是梦想。我的父母都没有在技术行业工作，当然也没有在初创公司工作，所以这真是令人大开眼界。我立刻知道，这就是我长大后要做的事情-成为一名企业家并创办公司。如果没有1996年对初创公司的这种接触，我想我可能多年都不会意识到这一点（如果有的话）。</p><p> Fast forward a few years later. Microsoft bought LinkExchange just 2 years later for a reported $265m. Tony and his college friend Alfred (who also was at LinkExchange) decided to start a startup incubator with their own money. (As a side note, the food at their restaurant in this incubator was fantastic!) This was bold and unique, because Idealab was really the only one doing something somewhat similar at the time. The concept of accelerators or incubators would not come in a big way until years later.</p><p> 几年后快进。两年后，微软以2.65亿美元的价格收购了LinkExchange。托尼（Tony）和他的大学朋友阿尔弗雷德（Alfred，也曾在LinkExchange工作）决定用自己的钱来创办一个创业孵化器。 （作为一个附带说明，这家孵化器所在餐厅的食物很棒！）这是大胆而独特的，因为Idealab当时确实是唯一一家做些类似事情的人。加速器或孵化器的概念要到几年后才会大有作为。</p><p> I don’t think Tony knew this, but while in high school, I cold-emailed almost every single one of his portfolio companies to ask them for an internship. I was determined to work at a startup as soon as possible in high school and start my startup career. I ended up working at one of his portfolio companies (probably unbeknownst to him) in the summer of 2000 which really help set me on my path to a career in startups. Often that first opportunity is the hardest to land, and each subsequent opportunity opens more and more doors.</p><p> 我不认为托尼知道这一点，但是在读高中时，我几乎给他的投资组合公司中的每一个公司发了冷电子邮件，要求他们进行实习。我决心尽快在高中时在一家初创公司工作，并开始我的初创职业生涯。 2000年夏天，我最终在他的投资组合公司之一（可能对他来说并不为人所知）工作，这确实帮助我踏上了进入初创企业的道路。通常，最难获得的是第一个机会，随后的每个机会都打开了越来越多的大门。</p><p> By late 2000, the stock market had crashed and everyone was fleeing startups. Newspapers ran headlines saying that tech was dead and that all programming jobs would be outsourced. They couldn’t have been more wrong, but most people panicked and stopped investing in startups. Tony, was always a first-principles thinker, and he leaned into this and ended up co-leading one of his portfolio companies Zappos. As an e-commerce company that provided free shipping and free returns, Zappos’ margins were razor thin. This scared most VCs. (This would certainly scare me.) But, he believed that it could work if customers had a great experience and would become repeat customers. So, he poured a lot of his own capital into the business when no VC at the time would touch this company. While many VCs pontificate about high level things, he looked at problems from a bottom’s up approach which made his thinking often unique from others.</p><p> 到2000年底，股票市场崩溃了，所有人都逃离了创业公司。报纸上的头条新闻说技术已经死了，所有编程工作都将外包。他们本来没有错，但是大多数人都惊慌失措，并停止了对初创企业的投资。托尼（Tony）一直是第一手原则的思想家，他倾心于此，最终成为他的投资组合公司Zappos的联合领导者。作为一家提供免费送货和免费退货服务的电子商务公司，Zappos的利润微薄。这让大多数风投感到恐惧。 （这肯定会吓到我。）但是，他认为，如果客户有丰富的经验，它将成为回头客，那么它可能会起作用。因此，当当时没有风投能够接触到这家公司时，他将大量自有资金投入了该业务。尽管许多风险投资家崇尚高水平的事情，但他从下而上的方式着眼于问题，这使他的思想常常与众不同。</p><p> In order to make the Zappos model work, he needed customer service to be top notch, reliable, and have a lower cost. It was clear to him that this model wouldn’t work in pricey San Francisco. So, he made another bold decision to move the company to Henderson, NV, which could provide all of those things. This was at a time when certainly most people believed you can only build an internet business in the San Francisco Bay Area. In hindsight, when they ended up needing to hire tons of people, being the BEST internet company in the Las Vegas area allowed them to swoop up talent that would have been a huge war to win in San Francisco. The other thing that was apparent to me, is that the Zappos family was incredibly diverse — and free to be themselves. Tony’s attention to culture and cultivating an open and welcoming work family left a lasting impact on me, and he started doing this well before it became a trend. Like so many of you, his book  Delivering Happiness has affected my own thinking.</p><p> 为了使Zappos模型工作，他需要客户服务一流，可靠并且成本较低。他很清楚，这种模式在昂贵的旧金山不起作用。因此，他做出了又一个大胆的决定，将公司迁至内华达州亨德森，该公司可以提供所有这些服务。当时大多数人都相信您只能在旧金山湾区建立互联网业务。事后看来，当他们最终需要雇用大量人才时，成为拉斯维加斯地区最佳的互联网公司使他们能够吸引人才，这在旧金山赢得一场巨大的战争。对我来说，另一件事很明显，那就是Zappos家族千差万别-可以自由生活。托尼（Tony）对文化的关注以及建立一个开放而热情的工作家庭对我产生了深远的影响，他开始做得很好，直到成为一种趋势。像你们中的许多人一样，他的书《传递幸福》影响了我自己的思想。</p><p> Fast forward many years, Jennifer and I were working on our own startup, and we were grappling with a particular challenge. We decided to consult Tony and get his advice. In a very Tony-like way, he basically told us to do what we thought was best. I remember feeling frustrated at the time, because…I didn’t know what was best! I had wanted him to tell me what he thought was best! But a good mentor helps you find your own answer – he/she doesn’t tell you the answer.</p><p> 快进了很多年，我和詹妮弗（Jennifer）都在自己的创业公司里工作，我们正在努力应对一个特殊的挑战。我们决定咨询Tony并征询他的意见。他基本上以一种类似于托尼的方式告诉我们，做我们认为最好的事情。我记得当时感到沮丧，因为……我不知道什么是最好的！我本来想让他告诉我他认为最好的！但是好的导师可以帮助您找到自己的答案-他/她不会告诉您答案。</p><p> In that meeting, he also pulled out a book and told me to read it. The book was  Start with Why by Simon Sinek. So I read it. The gist of the book is that to build a great company, you need to go back to first principles. Most people start building a company by trying to sell their product details. “Buy my shoes! They are grey with stripes.” But customers, employees, and everyone want to rally around something much bigger — something inspirational that the company stands for. It actually took me many years to process this and actually figure out how to implement this — I didn’t get this right for LaunchBit, but after marinating on this advice for years, this is what we’ve been striving to do at Hustle Fund. We aren’t just capital deployers. We are trying to create a movement and a philosophy. That particular meeting with Tony is one that I play in my head over and over – I feel like I finally understand what he was getting at and that is what I most wanted to tell him this weekend.</p><p> 在那次会议上，他还拿出一本书，叫我读。这本书是西蒙·西内克的《为什么开始》。所以我读了。这本书的要旨是要建立一个伟大的公司，您需要回到第一原则。大多数人开始通过尝试出售他们的产品详细信息来建立公司。 “买我的鞋子！它们是带有条纹的灰色。”但是客户，员工和每个人都希望团结起来，这是公司所代表的鼓舞人心的事情。实际上，我花了很多年的时间来处理这个问题，并弄清楚如何实现它-我对LaunchBit的理解并不正确，但是在借鉴了多年的建议之后，这就是我们在Hustle Fund上一直在努力做到的。我们不仅仅是资本部署者。我们正在尝试创造一种运动和一种哲学。与托尼的那一次特别的会面是我一次又一次地脑海中的一场比赛–我觉得我终于明白了他的意思，而这就是我本周末最想告诉他的。</p><p> If cynics believe that it’s impossible to get ahead in life without being an asshole, Tony Hsieh is a good example of someone who defies the norm. He was never flashy and always kind and generous to all. I could go on and on in writing this, but thank you, Tony, for helping me in so many ways that you may not have been aware. For your kindness, generosity, and inspiration.</p><p>如果愤世嫉俗的人认为，没有混蛋就不可能取得成功，谢天华就是一个反抗规范的好榜样。他从不浮华，对所有人总是友好和慷慨。我可以继续写这篇文章，但谢谢托尼，以许多您可能没有意识到的方式帮助我。为了您的好意，慷慨和启发。</p><p> Sending big hugs to the entire Hsieh family whom I consider to be my second family and who took me in during my formative years and had a huge impact on who I am today.</p><p> 向整个谢家全家寄予深厚的拥抱，我认为这是我的第二个家庭，在我成长的初期就把我带进了家，对我今天的人产生了巨大的影响。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://elizabethyin.com/2020/11/28/thank-you-tony/">https://elizabethyin.com/2020/11/28/thank-you-tony/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谢谢/">#谢谢</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/tony/">#tony</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
