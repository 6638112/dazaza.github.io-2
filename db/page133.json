It\u2019s not just you. If you check out our  homepage, the  Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage page, or the  Backblaze Computer Backup page, you\u2019ll experience a different look and feel than you\u2019re used to.\n After 14 years, a lot has changed at Backblaze. We started out in 2007 as a consumer cloud backup company. Today, we\u2019re a leader in the cloud storage industry with over an exabyte of data under management and we serve a wide variety of use cases for customers ranging from developers, to IT pros, to media-heavy businesses, and many more.\n In all that time, we haven\u2019t needed to change the brand. Like the services we provide, our brand was easy, trusted, and affordable.\n And while those core principles haven\u2019t changed, we realized that an update to our website and other communications tools could make the experience on our platforms clearer, more frictionless, and just plain  blazier. With that in mind, we hunkered down to deliver a rebrand that would achieve all of this and more.\n  I won\u2019t bore you with stories about the months of color wheels; name association and SWOT exercises; comparisons to other brands; and the blood, sweat, and tears our Creative and Front End Engineering teams poured into what went live today. All that and more contributed to this effort, but I do want to share some explanations relevant to you: What we changed, what we will change, and what we definitely  won\u2019t change.\n  Here are a few of the primary changes we\u2019ve made as part of the rebranding process:\n  The first thing many of you will notice is an updated logo. You can\u2019t help but love our little flame that never stops burning\u2014it\u2019s a symbol of the blazing fast backup service we launched with, and today also serves as a representation of how we help our customers blaze forward with their businesses. For reference, here\u2019s our old logo:\n  But you\u2019ll notice below that our new logo features an update to the typeface and the color. We\u2019ll talk about the updated color later, but the updated typeface is pretty straightforward. In its time, an all-caps name definitely worked, but today it feels a little \u201cshouty\u201d\u2014we wanted a look and feel that says, we\u2019re here to help you blaze on with whatever project comes next. We\u2019re supportive and uncomplicated, if maybe a little irreverent. A side bonus is that we\u2019d like the reporters of the world to know once and for all, there\u2019s only one uppercase letter in our name\u2026 Here\u2019s the new logo:\n   The overall user experience on the website has been updated to provide more ease for viewing on desktop or mobile. The navigation has been thoughtfully reorganized to make it easier to find the value each user needs within the site, especially within the robust footer we\u2019ve added.\n  The design brings in more space (or padding) around and between content to allow for greater flow. And in many places, full-width sections have become islands to help you focus on key content, along with directional links to move you through the site.\n  If you head over to the Wayback Machine, or check the screenshots below, you\u2019ll notice that our color palette is brighter, and, well, more \u201cred\u201d than before. Simply put, for the same reasons we doubled down on our blazing logo, we also doubled down on red. When you look around the cloud services space, it\u2019s a sea of quiet blues. Feels a little cold.\n We decided to own the heat: Whether you think of us as a catalyst, accelerant, or jet fuel, we\u2019re here to help you blaze forward with whatever you\u2019re trying to achieve\u2014whether that\u2019s a new app, business, or just backing up your precious data\u2014we\u2019ll keep you warm.\n   You don\u2019t have to look farther than our familiar blog layout to see that this rebrand hasn\u2019t touched the whole website, yet. We\u2019re working through the remainder of our pages and assets over the rest of this year, but all of the changes to come will by and large just carry forward the new look and feel we\u2019ve shared today.\n  This rebrand covers a number of subtle and not-so-subtle changes, but an important thing to emphasize is that the substance of Backblaze won\u2019t be changing. From day one, we\u2019ve focused on being easy, affordable, and trusted for our customers. With the commitment to stick to those values in mind, the first thing we did in our rebrand was to reaffirm what exactly our foundation is, and I thought it would be good to share it with you today:\n Backblaze\u2019s Foundation: Data is the digital world\u2019s most precious resource.

By exploringincel language use on Reddit, a global online message board, we contextualizethe incel community&#39;s online expressions of misogyny and real-world acts ofviolence perpetrated against women. After assembling around three millioncomments from incel-themed Reddit channels, we analyze the temporal dynamics ofa data driven rank ordering of the glossary of phrases belonging to an emergentincel lexicon. Our study reveals the generation and normalization of anextensive coded misogynist vocabulary in service of the group&#39;s identity.\n      Bibliographic Tools      Code &amp; Data      Related Papers       About arXivLabs   arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n  Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n  Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv&#39;s community?

", "note_en": "Hard work is often touted as the key American virtue that leads to success and opportunity. And there\u2019s lots of evidence to suggest that workers buy into the belief: For example, a  recent study found that Americans work 25 percent more hours than Europeans, and that U.S. workers tend to take fewer vacation days and retire later in life. But for many, simply working hard doesn\u2019t actually lead to a better life.\n   In the past, economists have acknowledged that citing hard work as the path to prosperity is  overly simplistic and optimistic. Ultimately, whether hard work alone can lift people into better economic conditions is a more complex question. The formula only works if an individual\u2019s efforts are met with opportunities for a better life. According to research, it\u2019s getting harder and harder for Americans to  move up the income ladder.\n A new poll from the Strong, Prosperous and Resilient Communities Challenge (SPARCC), an initiative to bolster local economies, found that Americans are quite skeptical of the narrative connecting wealth with personal agency. SPARCC found that 74 percent of those surveyed believed that most poor people work hard, but aren\u2019t able to work their way out of poverty due to the lack of economic opportunities. In the U.S.,  19 percent of income inequality is attributed to predetermined circumstances such as a person\u2019s race, gender, and parental income. The SPARCC report also points to past research showing that  economic mobility and health outcomes are greatly affected by geography as evidence that individual hard work won\u2019t ensure success because opportunities aren\u2019t evenly distributed.\n  The hard-work argument also plays into the policy discussion around inequality. As Katharine Bradbury and Robert Triest, both economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,  write:\n Increased inequality may result from increased risk taking and entrepreneurship in an environment of rapid technological change, with some entrepreneurs producing better, or just luckier, innovations than others, and reaping greater rewards. It may also result from increased disparities in work effort, with more industrious individuals earning higher incomes as a result of their greater effort. In both these cases, one could argue convincingly that the increase in inequality is justified and that no remedial changes in public policy are needed. On the other hand, if the increase in inequality results mostly from factors largely beyond the ability of individuals to control or counteract, then a strong case can be made for a public policy response.\n Bradbury and Triest say that without policy interventions, the inequality of opportunity is likely to persist while economic mobility deteriorates. SPARCC, for its part, is hoping to achieve greater mobility through  community-development investments in six cities. The initiative is a three-year, $90 million collaboration between the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Enterprise Community Partners, the Low Income Investment Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, and a handful of foundations.\n Restoring economic mobility is an especially crucial factor for those at the bottom: Of the children born in the bottom income quintile,  44 percent are still there as adults. That\u2019s an economic problem, but it\u2019s a deeper one as well, one that gets to the heart of what the American Dream is and who has access to it.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 01:58:15",

you want to think about it, it was funny or inevitable or symbolic that the robotic takeover did not start at MIT, NASA, Microsoft or Ford. It started at a Burger-G restaurant in Cary, NC on May 17. It seemed like such a simple thing at the time, but May 17 marked a pivotal moment in human history.\n Burger-G was a fast food chain that had come out of nowhere starting with its first restaurant in Cary. The Burger-G chain had an attitude and a style that said \u201chip\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d to a wide swath of the American middle class. The chain was able to grow with surprising speed based on its popularity and the public persona of the young founder, Joe Garcia. Over time, Burger-G grew to 1,000 outlets in the U.S. and showed no signs of slowing down. If the trend continued, Burger-G would soon be one of the \u201cTop 5\u201d fast food restaurants in the U.S.\n The \u201crobot\u201d installed at this first Burger-G restaurant looked nothing like the robots of popular culture. It was not hominid like C-3PO or futuristic like R2-D2 or industrial like an assembly line robot. Instead it was simply a PC sitting in the back corner of the restaurant running a piece of software. The software was called \u201cManna\u201d, version 1.0 *.\n Manna\u2019s job was to manage the store, and it did this in a most interesting way. Think about a normal fast food restaurant. A group of employees worked at the store, typically 50 people in a normal restaurant, and they rotated in and out on a weekly schedule. The people did everything from making the burgers to taking the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day. This was a completely normal arrangement. In the early twenty-first century, there were millions of businesses that operated in this way.\n But the fast food industry had a problem, and Burger-G was no different. The problem was the quality of the fast food experience. Some restaurants were run perfectly. They had courteous and thoughtful crew members, clean restrooms, great customer service and high accuracy on the orders. Other restaurants were chaotic and uncomfortable to customers. Since one bad experience could turn a customer off to an entire chain of restaurants, these poorly-managed stores were the Achilles heel of any chain.\n To solve the problem, Burger-G contracted with a software consultant and commissioned a piece of software. The goal of the software was to replace the managers and tell the employees what to do in a more controllable way. Manna version 1.0 was born.\n Manna was connected to the cash registers, so it knew how many people were flowing through the restaurant. The software could therefore predict with uncanny accuracy when the trash cans would fill up, the toilets would get dirty and the tables needed wiping down. The software was also attached to the time clock, so it knew who was working in the restaurant. Manna also had \u201chelp buttons\u201d throughout the restaurant. Small signs on the buttons told customers to push them if they needed help or saw a problem. There was a button in the restroom that a customer could press if the restroom had a problem. There was a button on each trashcan. There was a button near each cash register, one in the kiddie area and so on. These buttons let customers give Manna a heads up when something went wrong.\n At any given moment Manna had a list of things that it needed to do. There were orders coming in from the cash registers, so Manna directed employees to prepare those meals. There were also toilets to be scrubbed on a regular basis, floors to mop, tables to wipe, sidewalks to sweep, buns to defrost, inventory to rotate, windows to wash and so on. Manna kept track of the hundreds of tasks that needed to get done, and assigned each task to an employee one at a time.\n Manna told employees what to do simply by talking to them. Employees each put on a headset when they punched in. Manna had a voice synthesizer, and with its synthesized voice Manna told everyone exactly what to do through their headsets. Constantly. Manna micro-managed minimum wage employees to create perfect performance.\n Prefer the Kindle? \u201cManna\u201d is now available on the Kindle \u2013\u00a0 Click here!\n The software would speak to the employees individually and tell each one exactly what to do. For example, \u201cBob, we need to load more patties. Please walk toward the freezer.\u201d\n Or, \u201cJane, when you are through with this customer, please close your register. Then we will clean the women\u2019s restroom.\u201d\n And so on. The employees were told exactly what to do, and they did it quite happily. It was a major relief actually, because the software told them precisely what to do step by step.\n For example, when Jane entered the restroom, Manna used a simple position tracking system built into her headset to know that she had arrived. Manna then told her the first step.\n Manna: \u201cPlace the \u2018wet floor\u2019 warning cone outside the door please.\u201d\n When Jane completed the task, she would speak the word \u201cOK\u201d into her headset and Manna moved to the next step in the restroom cleaning procedure.\n      Once the restroom was clean, Manna would direct Jane to put everything away. Manna would make sure that she carefully washed her hands. Then Manna would immediately start Jane working on a new task. Meanwhile, Manna might send Lisa to the restroom to inspect it and make sure that Jane had done a thorough job. Manna would ask Lisa to check the toilets, the floor, the sink and the mirrors. If Jane missed anything, Lisa would report it.\n I grew up in Cary, NC. That was a long time ago, but when I was a kid I lived right in the middle of Cary with my parents. My father was a pilot for a big airline. My mother was a stay-at-home mom and I had a younger sister. We lived in a typical four bedroom suburban home in a nice neighborhood with a swimming pool in the backyard. I was a 15 year-old teenager working at the Burger-G on May 17 when the first Manna system came online.\n I can remember putting on the headset for the first time and the computer talking to me and telling me what to do. It was creepy at first, but that feeling really only lasted a day or so. Then you were used to it, and the job really did get easier. Manna never pushed you around, never yelled at you. The girls liked it because Manna didn\u2019t hit on them either. Manna simply asked you to do something, you did it, you said, \u201cOK\u201d, and Manna asked you to do the next step. Each step was easy. You could go through the whole day on autopilot, and Manna made sure that you were constantly doing something. At the end of the shift Manna always said the same thing. \u201cYou are done for today. Thank you for your help.\u201d Then you took off your headset and put it back on the rack to recharge. The first few minutes off the headset were always disorienting \u2014 there had been this voice in your head telling you exactly what to do in minute detail for six or eight hours. You had to turn your brain back on to get out of the restaurant.\n To me, Manna was OK. The job at Burger-G was mindless, and Manna made it easy by telling you exactly what to do. You could even get Manna to play music through your headphones, in the background. Manna had a set of \u201cstations\u201d that you could choose from. That was a bonus. And Manna kept you busy the entire day. Every single minute, you had something that Manna was telling you to do. If you simply turned off your brain and went with the flow of Manna, the day went by very fast.\n My father, on the other hand, did not like Manna at all from the very first day he saw me wearing the headset in the restaurant. He and Mom had come in for lunch and to say hi. I knew they were coming, so I had timed my break so I could sit down with them for a few minutes. When I sat down, my father noticed the headset.\n \u201cSo\u201d, he said, \u201cthey have you working the drive-thru I see. Is that a step up or a step down?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not the drive-thru,\u201d I replied, \u201cit\u2019s a new system they\u2019ve installed called Manna. It manages the store.\u201d\n     He looked at me for a long time, \u201cA computer is telling you what to do on the job? What does the manager do?\u201d\n  \u201cYou mean that a computer is telling you what to do all day?\u201d, he asked.\n   I gave him an example, \u201cBefore you got here, I was taking out the trash. Manna told me how to do it.\u201d\n  \u201cIt tells you exactly what to do. Like, It told me to get four new bags from the rack. When I did that it told me to go to trash can #1. Once I got there it told me to open the cabinet and pull out the trash can. Once I did that it told me to check the floor for any debris. Then it told me to tie up the bag and put it to the side, on the left. Then it told me to put a new bag in the can. Then it told me to attach the bag to the rim. Then it told me to put the can back in and close the cabinet. Then it told me to wipe down the cabinet and make sure it\u2019s spotless. Then it told me to push the help button on the can to make sure it is working. Then it told me to move to trash can #2. Like that.\u201d\n He looked at me for a long time again before he said, \u201cGood Lord, you are nothing but a piece of a robot. What is it saying to you now?\u201d\n \u201cIt just told me I have three minutes left on my break. And it told me to smile and say hello to the guests. How\u2019s this? Hi!\u201d And I gave him a big toothy grin.\n \u201cYesterday the people controlled the computers. Now the computers control the people. You are the eyes and hands for this robot. And all so that Joe Garcia can make $20 million per year. Do you know what will happen if this spreads?\u201d\n \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And I think Mr. G makes more than $20 million a year. But right now I\u2019ve got two minutes left, and Manna is telling me that I need to move back to station 3 to get ready for the next run. See ya.\u201d I waved at Mom. Dad just stared at me.\n The tests in our Burger-G store were surprisingly successful. There were Burger-G corporate guys in the restaurant watching us, fixing bugs in the software, making sure Manna was covering all the bases, and they were pleased. It took about 3 months to work all the kinks out, and as they did the Manna software totally changed the restaurant. Worker performance nearly doubled. So did customer satisfaction. So did the consistency of the customer\u2019s experience. Trash cans never overfilled. Bathrooms were remarkably clean. Employees always washed their hands when they needed to. Food was ready faster. The meals we handed out were nearly 100 percent accurate because Manna made us check to make sure every item in the bag was exactly what the customer ordered. The store never ran out of supplies \u2014 there were always plenty of napkins in the dispenser and the ketchup container was always full. There were enough employees in the store for the busy times, because Manna could accurately track trends and staff appropriately.\n In addition, Burger-G saved a ton of money. Burger-G had hundreds of stores in the United States. Manna worked so well that Burger-G deployed it nationwide. Soon Burger-G had cut more than 3,000 of its higher-paid store employees \u2014 mostly assistant managers and managers. That one change saved the company nearly $100 million per year, and all that money came straight to the bottom line for the restaurant chain. Shareholders were ecstatic. Mr. G gave himself another big raise to celebrate. In addition, Manna had optimized store staffing and had gotten a significant productivity boost out of the employees in the store. That saved another $150 million. $250 million made a huge difference in the fast food industry.\n Prefer the Kindle? \u201cManna\u201d is now available on the Kindle \u2013\u00a0 Click here!\n So, the first wave of fast food robots did not replace all of the burger flipping employees as everyone had expected. The robots replaced middle management and significantly improved the performance of minimum wage employees. All of the other fast food chains watched the Burger-G experiment with Manna closely, and they started installing Manna systems as well. Soon, nearly every business in America that had a significant pool of minimum-wage employees was installing Manna software or something similar. They had to do it in order to compete.\n In other words, Manna spread through the American corporate landscape like wildfire. And my dad was right. It was when all of these new Manna systems began talking to each other that things started to get uncomfortable.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 01:57:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4eba\u7c7b,views,manna", "title": "Manna  - \u4eba\u7c7b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u89c2\u70b9 - \u7b2c1\u7ae0 ", "title_en": "Manna \u2013 Two Views of Humanity\u2019s Future \u2013 Chapter 1", "transed": 1, "url": "https://marshallbrain.com/manna1", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4eba\u7c7b", "views", "manna"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4d4ac7ffb15e951481ab77f766c9959e.jpeg", "infoid": 1067506, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Peloton\u73b0\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u80ce\u9762+\u7684\u9ad8\u7aef\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7cfb\u5217\u768439.99\u7f8e\u5143\u8ba2\u9605\u8d39\u3002  \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\uff06\uff0334;\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u798f\u7949\uff06\uff0334;

service to its Tread+ customers unless they get a Peloton Membership.\n  In an email sent to\u00a0a user, the company stated\u00a0&#34;safety and well-being&#34; as a reason behind this move.\n &#34;We care deeply about the safety and well-being of our Members and we created Tread Lock to secure your Tread+ against unauthorized access,&#34; writes Peloton\u00a0in an email.\n Following the tragic death of a six-year-old and reports of 72 injuries like\u00a0broken bones, cuts, and grazes from Tread, Peloton had  recalled over 125,000 of its treadmills\u00a0from both American and British markets last month.\n As is, the company has\u00a0dropped &#34;Just Run&#34; from its treadmills except for those with a membership.\n &#34;Unfortunately at this time, &#39;Just Run&#39; is no longer accessible without a Peloton Membership,&#34; the email continued:\n  All Tread+ owners have been granted a three-month &#34;fee waiver&#34; for an All Access Membership, providing everyone in a household access to personalized workouts, training programs, and metrics.\n   In a dramatic twist,\u00a0Peloton customers, who believe they have already coughed up a handsome price for the treadmill,\u00a0heavily criticized the move and likened the idea to ransom demands.\n &#34;So wait\u2026 You buy a $3000 treadmill, then after you&#39;ve purchased, with a \u2018software update\u2019 they stop it from working until you pay them $39.99/mo? Sounds like theft &amp; ransomware to me\u2026,&#34;  tweeted Wes Kennedy.\n &#34;Wow. The Peloton Tread will no longer allow you to use your $3000 treadmill without a $39.99 a month subscription.\u00a0The pretext is their design issues that led to a child&#39;s death,&#34;  said Brianna Wu, Rebellion PAC executive director and former Massachusetts candidate for US House.\n  A few others believe with so many consumers left surprised, the company may have opened itself up to a class-action lawsuit [ 1,  2,  3].\n It isn&#39;t imminently clear how the introduction of\u00a0a subscription model enhances\u00a0customers&#39; safety and well-being.\n BleepingComputer\u00a0reached out to\u00a0Peloton with these questions\u00a0prior to publishing and we were told:\n &#34;In our ongoing work to ensure our products are even safer, as part of our voluntary recall in collaboration with  CPSC, we released Tread Lock, a four-digit passcode to secure Tread+ against unauthorized access.&#34;\n &#34;Unfortunately, Tread Lock is not yet available without a Peloton Membership, which means Tread+ owners without a subscription cannot access Just Run at this time.&#34;\n &#34;We understand this is an inconvenience for some and have waived three months of All-Access Membership for all Tread+ owners.&#34;\n &#34;As a reminder, under the terms of our  voluntary recall, Tread+ owners can return their Tread+ for a full refund by contacting Member support,&#34; a Peloton spokesperson told BleepingComputer.\n BleepingComputer\u00a0has additionally asked Peloton to clarify whether\u00a0Peloton plans on bringing Tread Lock to non-subscribers as well, or will the\u00a0subscription requirement apply indefinitely\u00a0from this point on.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 01:57:33", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "peloton,tread,\u80ce\u9762", "title": "\u53ec\u56de\u540e\uff0cPeloton\u80ce\u9762\u6240\u6709\u8005\u73b0\u5728\u88ab\u8feb\u6bcf\u6708\u8ba2\u9605 ", "title_en": "Peloton Tread owners now forced into monthly subscription after recall", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/peloton-tread-owners-now-forced-into-monthly-subscription-after-recall/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["peloton", "tread", "\u80ce\u9762"]}]
