Longer time spent living in low-income families was associated with higher risks of developing mental disorders. Associations were strongest for substance misuse and personality disorders and weaker for mood disorders and anxiety/somatoform disorders. An exception was eating disorders, with low parental income being associated with attenuated risk. For all diagnostic categories examined except for eating disorders, downward socioeconomic mobility was linked with higher subsequent risk and upward socioeconomic mobility with lower subsequent risk of developing mental disorders.</p><p>  在收入最低的五分之一家庭中出生的孩子中，有四分之一（25.2％; 95％的CI 24.8–25.6％）到37岁时将具有经二级保健诊断的精神障碍，而在30岁以下的孩子中则有13.5％（13.2–13.9％）收入最高的五分之一。在低收入家庭中生活时间越长，患精神障碍的风险就越高。物质滥用和人格障碍的关联最强，而情绪障碍和焦虑/躯体形式障碍的联想最弱。饮食失调是一个例外，父​​母收入较低会降低患病风险。对于除饮食失调以外的所有诊断类别，社会经济活动性下降与随后的较高风险相关，社会经济活动性上升与继发于精神障碍的较低风险相关。</p><p>  Except for eating disorders, low parental income during childhood is associated with subsequent increased risk of mental disorders diagnosed in secondary care across the diagnostic spectrum. Early interventions to mitigate the disadvantages linked with low income, and better opportunities for upward socioeconomic mobility could reduce social and mental health inequalities.</p><p>  除饮食失调外，儿童期父母收入低与在整个诊断范围内在二级保健中诊断出的精神失常的风险增加有关。尽早采取干预措施以减轻与低收入有关的不利因素，并为提高社会经济流动性提供更多机会，可以减少社会和心理健康方面的不平等现象。</p><p>    Experiencing material deprivation at an early age has been linked with subsequent elevated risk of developing a mental disorder, with children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds being more likely to experience poor mental health in adulthood [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Although these links have been well-established, much of the published evidence has been generated from cross-sectional studies, and so it remains unclear how risks of mental illnesses could vary in relation to changing parental socioeconomic positions (SEP) during childhood. Researchers have also tended to apply occupational status or educational attainment levels, rather than income levels, as indicators of parental SEP. Whilst the various measures of SEP could reflect different aspects of a child’s home environment, parental income is more likely than parental occupational status or parental educational attainment to fluctuate over time, and could be considered to be a more sensitive measure for capturing any changes in socioeconomic conditions through childhood. Published research on parental SEP and mental health in adulthood has mostly concentrated on specific disorders, mainly depression [ 6], and it thus remains unclear how risks compare across the whole diagnostic spectrum. In addition, the absolute risks of developing these disorders in relation to childhood socioeconomic conditions have seldom been reported, as previously conducted studies have commonly estimated relative risks only.</p><p>    早年经历的物质剥夺与随后出现精神障碍的风险增加有关，来自社会弱势背景的儿童在成年后更有可能经历不良的心理健康[1、2、3、4、5]。尽管已经建立了这些联系，但许多已公开的证据是从横断面研究中得出的，因此，尚不清楚儿童期心理疾病的风险与父母社会经济地位的变化有何关系。研究人员还倾向于将职业状况或受教育程度而非收入水平作为父母SEP的指标。尽管SEP的各种衡量标准可以反映儿童家庭环境的不同方面，但父母收入比父母的职业地位或父母的受教育程度随时间波动的可能性更大，并且可以被认为是捕捉社会经济变化的更敏感的措施。儿童时期的状况。已发表的关于成年期父母SEP和心理健康的研究主要集中在特定的疾病上，主要是抑郁症[6]，因此，尚不清楚如何在整个诊断范围内比较风险。此外，很少报道与儿童的社会经济状况有关的发展这些疾病的绝对风险，因为先前进行的研究通常仅估计相对风险。</p><p> Using interlinked national Danish registry data, we conducted a comprehensive longitudinal analysis to explore links between parental income, and income mobility, during childhood and subsequent risk of developing mental disorders that were diagnosed in secondary care settings across the full diagnostic spectrum. Parental income was measured during birth year and at ages 5 (early childhood), 10 (middle childhood) and 15 (adolescence) years. We addressed the following research questions: (1) What are the associations between parental income measured at these four ages and risks of developing any mental disorder and specific disorders after 15th birthday?; (2) Does duration of time spent in materially deprived versus more affluent conditions modify risks?; (3) Are changes in parental income quintile between birth and 15th birthday associated with variability in risk? We examined the following diagnostic groups: (i) any mental disorder, (ii) substance misuse disorders, (iii) personality disorders, (iv) broadly defined schizophrenia, (v) mood disorders, (vi) anxiety/somatoform disorders and (vii) eating disorders. We estimated both relative risks (as hazard ratios) and absolute risks (as cumulative incidence values). Whereas hazard ratios usefully indicate elevations in risk compared to a reference population, absolute risk estimates are more intuitive, clinically relevant and may usefully inform service planning.</p><p>我们使用相互联系的丹麦国家注册管理机构的数据，进行了全面的纵向分析，以探索儿童时期父母收入与收入流动性之间的联系，以及随后在整个诊断范围内在二级保健机构中诊断出的精神疾病的风险。父母的收入在出生年份以及5岁（儿童年龄），10岁（儿童年龄）和15岁（青少年）期间进行测量。我们解决了以下研究问题：（1）在这四个年龄段测得的父母收入与15岁生日后出现任何精神障碍和特定障碍的风险之间有什么关联？ （2）在物质匮乏和较富裕的环境中度过的时间是否会改变风险？ （3）出生至15岁生日之间父母收入的五分位数变化是否与风险差异相关？我们检查了以下诊断组：（i）任何精神障碍，（ii）药物滥用障碍，（iii）人格障碍，（iv）广泛定义的精神分裂症，（v）情绪障碍，（vi）焦虑/躯体形式障碍和（vii ）饮食失调。我们估计了相对风险（作为危险比）和绝对风险（作为累积发生值）。相对于参考人群，风险比有效地表明了风险的增加，而绝对风险估计则更直观，更相关于临床，并且可以为服务规划提供有用的信息。</p><p> We delineated a national cohort of persons born in Denmark to two Danish-born parents between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 2000, who were living in Denmark at their 15th birthdays. Since 1968, the Danish Civil Registration System [ 7] has maintained information on all residents, including demographic details and links to parents as well as continuous updates on place of residence and vital status. Unique personal identification numbering enables accurate individual-level interlinkage of multiple national registers. The Danish Data Protection Agency approved the study, with data access agreed by Statistics Denmark and the Danish Health Data Authority. Informed consent from cohort members was not required in this register-based study.</p><p> 我们将1980年1月1日至2000年12月31日在丹麦出生的人的全国队列划分为两名丹麦出生的父母，他们在15岁生日时居住在丹麦。自1968年以来，丹麦民事登记系统[7]一直保留着所有居民的信息，包括人口统计资料和与父母的联系以及居住地和生活状况的不断更新。独特的个人识别号码可以实现多个国家注册簿之间准确的个人级互连。丹麦数据保护局批准了这项研究，并获得了丹麦统计局和丹麦健康数据管理局的数据访问权。在这项基于登记的研究中，无需征得队列成员的知情同意。</p><p>  Information about maternal and paternal gross annual income was obtained from the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research [ 8]. Gross income is a broad income measure, which includes salary, entrepreneurial income, capital income, public transfer payments and pensions, and it was measured in the child’s birth year (age 0) and at ages 5, 10 and 15 years. Parental income was calculated by summing maternal and paternal income. The aggregate values were grouped as quintiles in the national distribution for that calendar year, with quintile 1 representing the lowest income and quintile 5 the highest. Additionally, we constructed a cumulative parental income indicator by adding the parental income quintiles measured at each of the four ages together. This scale ranged from 4 to 20, with a value of 4 representing parental income being consistently in the lowest income quintile across the four ages and a score of 20 indicating living in the most affluent quintile families through childhood. The scale thus indicates both relative parental income levels and their duration between birth and 15th birthday. The scale was applied in two recently reported Danish registry studies [ 9,  10].</p><p>  有关孕产妇和父亲的年度总收入的信息是从劳动力市场研究综合数据库中获得的[8]。总收入是一项广泛的收入指标，包括薪金，企业收入，资本收入，公共转移支付和养老金，并以孩子的出生年份（0岁）以及5岁，10岁和15岁为准。父母收入是通过将母亲收入和父亲收入相加得出的。该总值在该日历年的国家分布中按五分位数分组，五分位数1代表最低收入，五分位数5代表最高收入。此外，我们通过将四个年龄段中每个年龄段测得的父母收入五分位数加在一起，构建了一个累积的父母收入指标。该量表的范围从4到20，其中4代表父母的收入始终处于四个年龄段的最低收入五分之一中，得分20表示整个童年时期生活在最富裕的五分之一家庭中。因此，该量表既显示了相对父母的收入水平，也显示了他们的出生与15岁生日之间的持续时间。该量表应用于两项最近报道的丹麦注册研究[9，10]。</p><p>  Information on psychiatric diagnoses was obtained from the Psychiatric Central Research Register [ 11]. Using this source, we could examine only persons diagnosed and treated with mental disorders in secondary care settings; i.e. from 1969, patients admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit or department and, from 1995, those who had contact with a mental health specialist in an outpatient clinic or a general hospital emergency room. The following two groups of mental disorders were not captured in this national register: those diagnosed by general practitioners; those diagnosed by psychiatrists working in private practice, although such practice is rare in Denmark. The Danish modification of the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8) was utilised from 1969 to 1993, with the Tenth Revision (ICD-10) used from 1994 onwards. Classification of the examined mental disorders is shown in Additional file  1: eTable 1.</p><p>  有关精神病诊断的信息可从《精神病学中央研究注册簿》中获得[11]。使用此来源，我们只能检查在二级保健机构中被诊断出患有精神疾病的人；即，从1969年开始，住院精神病患者就诊的患者；从1995年开始，在门诊诊所或综合医院急诊室与心理健康专家取得联系的患者。国家注册簿中未记录以下两组精神障碍：由全科医生诊断的精神障碍；由在私人诊所工作的精神病医生诊断的病人，尽管这种做法在丹麦很少见。从1969年到1993年采用了对国际疾病分类第八次修订版（ICD-8）的丹麦修订版，从1994年开始使用了第十次修订版（ICD-10）。附加文件1：eTable 1.中显示了所检查的精神障碍的分类。</p><p>  The following covariates, which were assessed in a previous study [ 10] and have been linked with elevated risk of developing mental disorders, were fitted in multivariable models: paternal and maternal educational attainment (from the Danish Education Register) [ 12], history of paternal and maternal mental disorders (from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register [ 11]), degree of urbanisation at cohort members’ place of residence in their birth year [ 13] and total number of child-parent separation status changes between birth and 15th birthday (from the Danish Civil Registration System [ 7]).

For each diagnostic category examined, individuals who had received a relevant diagnosis within that category prior to their 15th birthday were excluded from the analysis. Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for gender, birth year and time-varying calendar year period, were fitted to estimate the hazard ratios (relative risks) of developing the examined mental disorders. Schoenfeld’s residuals were assessed to verify that the proportional hazards assumption was met. Cumulative incidence (absolute risk) of developing mental disorders from 15th to 37th birthday was estimated using competing-risks regression, [ 14] with emigration from Denmark and death being treated as competing events.

Just under a half of all cohort members were women (48.7%), and 107,394 individuals (60.1% women) were diagnosed with a mental disorder in a secondary care setting after reaching age 15 over the aggregated follow-up period of 11.6 million person years.

These associations were non-linear with considerably higher risks observed among cohort members who were brought up in the poorest families (i.e. income quintile 1). Similar relative risk patterns were observed when parental income at age 15 years was investigated (Additional file  1: eTable 3). In general, risks were higher for substance misuse disorders (quintile 1 at birth: HR 3.44; 95% CI 3.27–3.62), and personality disorders (HR 2.76; 95% CI 2.64–2.88), and somewhat lower for mood disorders (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.67–1.78) and anxiety/somatoform disorders (HR 2.11; 95% CI 2.06–2.17). Adjustment for additional covariates (parental education, history of parental mental disorder, level of urbanicity at birth and number of changes in child-parental separation status) attenuated the strength of the observed associations, but risk gradients remained. Across the spectrum of mental illnesses, eating disorders was the only diagnostic category for which low parental income did not predict elevated risk. In fact, the risk of developing an eating disorder was lower among cohort members who were in lowest parental income during their birth year (HR 0.90; 95% 0.85–0.96).</p><p> 表1中的结果显示了出生时父母收入的五分位数与以后出现任何精神障碍，药物滥用障碍，人格障碍，广泛定义的精神分裂症，情绪障碍和焦虑/躯体形式障碍的风险之间呈负相关。这些联系是非线性的，在最贫穷家庭（即收入五分之一）中长大的同辈成员中观察到的风险要高得多。当调查15岁年龄段的父母收入时，观察到类似的相对风险模式（附加文件1：eTable 3）。通常，物质滥用障碍（出生时五分之一：HR 3.44； 95％CI 3.27–3.62）和人格障碍（HR 2.76； 95％CI 2.64–2.88）的风险较高，而情绪障碍（HR）较低1.72； 95％CI 1.67-1.78）和焦虑症/躯体形式障碍（HR 2.11； 95％CI 2.06-2.17）。调整其他协变量（父母的教育程度，父母的精神疾病史，出生时的城市化程度以及儿童与父母之间的分离状态变化的数量）减弱了所观察到的关联的强度，但风险梯度仍然存在。在所有精神疾病中，饮食失调是唯一的诊断类别，父母的低收入并不能预示其风险会增加。实际上，在出生年父母收入最低的队列成员中，发生饮食失调的风险较低（HR 0.90； 95％0.85-0.96）。</p><p>  Figure  1 and Additional file  1: eTable 4 show the associations between duration of parental income levels during childhood, as represented by the cumulative parental income scale, and subsequent risks of developing a mental disorder. The results indicate that children whose families remained in the lowest income quintile through childhood (parental income score = 4) had the highest risk (HR 3.44; 95% CI 3.33–3.55) of developing a mental disorder versus those who experienced affluent conditions throughout (score = 20). Overall, the longer the time a child spent living in a more economically disadvantaged familial environment (i.e. the lower the score), the higher the subsequent risk. Among the diagnostic categories examined (Fig.  1 and Additional file  1: eTables 5–9), the associations were strongest for substance misuse disorders and for personality disorders. Cohort members who remained in the lowest parental income quintile through childhood had much higher risks of developing these conditions versus their peers who were continuously brought up in affluence; substance misuse disorders: HR 7.68; 95% CI 7.01–8.42; personality disorders: HR 5.38; 95% CI 5.00–5.78. On the contrary, although longer time spent living in poorer conditions was still associated with higher risks of developing mood disorders, the associations were much weaker. For all disorders, the associations were attenuated when adjusted for additional covariates, but risk gradients remained (Fig.  1). Cohort members who were in the lowest income quintile in their birth year, and also at ages 5, 10 and 15, had an absolute risk of 34.3% (95% CI 33.4, 35.1%) for being diagnosed with any mental disorder by age 37, compared with 12.0% (95% CI 11.5, 12.5%) risk for those individuals who were in the highest income quintile in their birth years at ages 5, 10 and 15 as well.</p><p>  图1和附加文件1：e表4显示了儿童期父母收入水平的持续时间（以累积父母收入规模为代表）与随后患上精神障碍的风险之间的关系。结果表明，与整个过程中经历过富裕状况的儿童相比，其家庭直到童年时期收入最低的五分之一儿童（父母的收入得分= 4）患精神障碍的风险最高（HR 3.44； 95％CI 3.33–3.55）。分数= 20）。总体而言，孩子在经济上处于较不利的家庭环境中生活的时间越长（即分数越低），随后的风险就越高。在所检查的诊断类别中（图1和附加文件1：eTables 5-9），这种关联在药物滥用障碍和人格障碍方面最强。与一直富裕的同龄人相比，到童年时父母收入最低的五分之一的同龄人患这些疾病的风险要高得多。物质滥用障碍：HR 7.68； 95％CI 7.01–8.42;人格障碍：HR 5.38； 95％CI 5.00–5.78。相反，尽管花更多时间在较差的条件下生活仍然会增加患情绪障碍的风险，但这种联系却弱得多。对于所有疾病，调整其他协变量后其关联性减弱，但风险梯度仍然存在（图1）。在同龄人中收入最低的五分之一，以及在5、10和15岁时，在37岁时被诊断出患有任何精神障碍的绝对风险为34.3％（95％CI 33.4，35.1％） ，而在5岁，10岁和15岁时出生年龄处于五分之一收入最高的个人的风险为12.0％（95％CI 11.5，12.5％）。</p><p> Hazard ratios for any mental disorder, substance misuse disorders, personality disorders, broadly defined schizophrenia, mood disorders, anxiety/somatoform disorders by parental income scale during childhood.

The absolute risks for the specific diagnostic categories examined are shown in Additional file  1: eTable 11.

Absolute risks were lower for broadly defined schizophrenia (3.9%; 95% CI 3.7–4.0%), substance misuse disorders (5.3%; 95% CI 5.2–5.5%), personality disorders (6.7%; 95% CI 6.5–7.0%) and eating disorders (1.6%; 95% CI 1.5–1.7%).</p><p> 图3显示了在出生年15岁至37岁生日之间患精神疾病的累计发生率值（按父母收入水平）。出生时收入最低的五分之一人口的个人发生率为25.2％（95％CI 24.8-25.6％）。 ）在37岁时被诊断出患有精神疾病的风险，而出生在最富裕的五分之一人群中的患病风险为13.5％（95％CI为13.2-13.9％）。附加文件1：eTable 11中显示了所检查的特定诊断类别的绝对风险。尽管滥用药物和人格障碍的相对风险最高，但收入最低的家庭出生的儿童出现焦虑/躯体形式的绝对风险最高。疾病（15.8％； 95％CI 15.5–16.2％）和情绪障碍（9.6％； 95％CI 9.3–9.9％）。广泛定义的精神分裂症的绝对风险较低（3.9％; 95％CI 3.7–4.0％），药物滥用障碍（5.3％; 95％CI 5.2–5.5％），人格障碍（6.7％; 95％CI 6.5–7.0％） ）和进食障碍（1.6％； 95％CI 1.5–1.7％）。</p><p> Cumulative incidence of any mental disorder by 37th birthday according to the parental income quintiles during birth year.

Compared with those who were born and remained in quintile 5 (the most affluent quintile) at age 15, downward mobility was associated with elevated risks of developing mental disorders across the diagnostic spectrum (with the exception of eating disorders). On the contrary, when compared with those who were born and remained in quintile 1 (the lowest quintile) at age 15, upward mobility was associated with decreased risks of developing mental disorders. The exception for this was again eating disorders, for which upward mobility was associated with increased risk.</p><p>对于最上流的人群（例如，出生于五分之一的儿童，并在15岁时居住在五分之一的儿童），以及那些在童年时期经历最大程度的向下活动能力的儿童（即，出生于五分之一和五岁的儿童），存在患精神障碍的风险。表2列出了15岁时居住在1号五分之一中的人）。与15岁时出生并仍居住在5号五分之一（最富裕的五分之一）中的人相比，向下运动与诊断期间出现精神障碍的风险增加相关频谱（饮食失调除外）。相反，与15岁时出生并保持在五分之一年龄段（最低的五分之一年龄段）的人相比，向上运动会降低患精神障碍的风险。例外情况是进食障碍，向上运动与增加的风险有关。</p><p> In this cohort study of over a million Danish persons, we found that lower parental income, longer time spent growing up in financially poorer conditions and downward family income mobility during childhood were associated with higher risk for developing a secondary care-diagnosed mental disorder as a young adult. The greatest hazard ratios observed were for substance misuse disorders and for personality disorders, but similar patterns were seen across a broad range of mental disorder diagnostic categories. These risk patterns were attenuated but persisted when further adjustments were made for history of parental mental illness, parental educational attainment levels, urbanicity and number of changes in child-parent separation status between birth and 15th birthday. Importantly, around a quarter of young adults who were born into the lowest income families will have developed a mental disorder by age 37, compared with 13% of those born into the most affluent families. The risk patterns observed were strikingly different for eating disorders, for which lower parental income during childhood was associated with lower subsequent risk of developing disorder.</p><p> 在这项针对超过100万丹麦人的队列研究中，我们发现，父母收入较低，在经济状况较差的情况下长大的成长时间以及童年时期家庭收入流动性下降与发生继发性经诊断为精神病的风险较高有关年轻的成年人。观察到的最大危险比是药物滥用障碍和人格障碍，但是在广泛的精神障碍诊断类别中观察到了相似的模式。当进一步调整父母的精神病史，父母的受教育程度，城市化程度以及出生至15岁生日之间的父母亲分离状态变化的次数时，这些风险模式已减弱，但仍然存在。重要的是，到收入最低的家庭出生的年轻人中，约有四分之一到37岁时会出现精神障碍，而在最富裕的家庭中，这一比例为13％。饮食失调的观察到的风险模式显着不同，因为儿童时期父母收入的降低与随后患疾病的风险降低有关。</p><p> We conducted a comprehensive investigation of parental income levels during childhood and later risks for developing mental disorders across the full spectrum of psychiatric diagnostic categories. Although there are some notable exceptions [ 9,  10,  15], most studies that investigated links between parental income and later risks of mental disorder did not take into account changes in income levels during childhood. Using parental income data from early-mid childhood, a study from Sweden has identified five income trajectories and reported that persistence of low family income and downward trajectories in income levels were associated with the highest subsequent risks of developing a range of mental disorders [ 15]. With a much larger number of cohort members examined in our study, instead of using group-based trajectory modelling, we have taken an optimal alternative approach by investigating temporal </p><p> 我们对儿童时期父母的收入水平以及以后在整个精神科诊断类别中发展为精神障碍的风险进行了全面调查。尽管有一些显着的例外[9、10、15]，但是大多数调查父母收入与以后精神疾病风险之间联系的研究都没有考虑到儿童时期收入水平的变化。瑞典的一项研究使用儿童早期至中期的父母收入数据，确定了五种收入轨迹，并报告说，持续的低家庭收入和收入水平的下降轨迹与发生一系列精神障碍的最高风险相关[15] 。在我们的研究中检查了更多的队列成员，而不是使用基于组的轨迹模型，我们通过调查时态采用了一种最佳的替代方法</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01794-5">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01794-5</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/风险/">#风险</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/income/">#income</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/父母/">#父母</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
