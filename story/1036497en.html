Reflections of turboprop planes flit across the building’s mirrored panes. Across the street a retro McDonnell Douglas sign perches above the aerospace giant’s former factory, and just around the corner Virgin Orbit is  developing air-launched rockets.</p><p>去年夏天，一家秘密的太空公司在长滩机场周围被阳光普照的工业区的一个大型仓库中居住。涡轮螺旋桨飞机的反射在建筑物的镜面玻璃板上飞舞。马路对面是一个复古的麦克唐纳·道格拉斯标志，高高耸立在这家航空航天巨头的前工厂上方，维尔京轨道号（Virgin Orbit）就在拐角处，正在研发空射火箭。</p><p> It’s a fitting headquarters for SpinLaunch, a company  breathing new life into the decades-old idea of using giant mechanical slings to hurl rockets into orbit. The man behind this audacious plan is the serial entrepreneur Jonathan Yaney. For years he ran SpinLaunch out of a former microprocessor plant in Silicon Valley, down the road from Google. Now the company is ready to open a proper rocket factory, where it will churn out launch vehicles and, if all goes well, take its first steps into the cosmos.</p><p> 这是SpinLaunch的合适总部，该公司为使用数十年的使用巨型机械吊索将火箭投向轨道的想法注入了新的活力。这个大胆计划背后的人是连续企业家乔纳森·雅尼（Jonathan Yaney）。多年以来，他一直将SpinLaunch从硅谷的硅谷一家微处理器工厂中淘汰出来。现在，该公司已准备好开设一家合适的火箭工厂，在那里将生产运载火箭，如果一切顺利，则迈出进入宇宙的第一步。</p><p>  When I visited this past fall, SpinLaunch employees were still unpacking from the move. As we walked among giant sheets of steel, Yaney explained how his launcher will work. A centrifuge large enough to contain a football field will whip a rocket around in circles for roughly an hour, its speed steadily ramping up to more than 5,000 mph. The vehicle and its payload—up to 200 pounds’ worth of satellite—will experience forces that, at their peak, will be ten thousand times stronger than gravity. Once it’s spinning at launch speed, the centrifuge will release the rocket and send it screaming into the stratosphere. At the threshold of the cosmos, it will fire its engine for a final nudge into orbit.</p><p>  当我去年秋天访问时，SpinLaunch的员工仍在搬迁。当我们在巨大的钢板中行走时，Yaney解释了他的发射器将如何工作。足够大以容纳足球场的离心机会将火箭绕圈甩动大约一个小时，其速度稳定地提高到每小时5,000英里以上。车辆及其有效载荷（价值高达200磅的卫星）将承受的力量在其顶峰时将比重力强一万倍。一旦以发射速度旋转，离心机将释放火箭，并将其尖叫到平流层。在宇宙的尽头，它将发射引擎以最终推动进入轨道。</p><p>  The idea that an object weighing thousands of pounds can punch its way into space after spinning in circles on Earth’s surface can be hard to fathom. It might even sound crazy, and the company has a lot to prove to shake its critics. So far it has managed to spin an 11-pound dummy payload at more than 4,000 mph and send it crashing into a steel wall. Between those tests and the edge of space, however, are roughly a hundred miles and a whole lot of air resistance. Never mind the engineering work needed to build a centrifuge 100 yards wide, with an arm strong enough to support a roughly SUV-sized rocket.</p><p>  一个重达数千磅的物体在地球表面绕圈旋转后可以冲入太空的想法很难理解。这听起来甚至很疯狂，而且该公司还有很多值得证明的事实，足以动摇其批评家。到目前为止，它已经设法以超过4,000英里/小时的速度旋转了11磅的虚拟有效载荷，并将其撞到钢墙上。但是，在这些测试与太空边缘之间大约有100英里，并且空气阻力很大。没关系，建造一个100码宽的离心机所需的工程工作，它的臂力足以支撑大约SUV大小的火箭。</p><p> Yaney hopes this is the year he achieves vindication. The company plans to conduct its first suborbital launches this winter at a new test site in New Mexico. Assuming the system works, Spinlaunch promises to reduce the cost of sending small satellites into space by a factor of almost 20. But the bigger deal may be its launch cadence. Yaney predicts the mass accelerator will be able to do five launches a day; most rocket companies can’t do that many launches in a month. In the era of mega-satellite constellations, which will see thousands of small satellites sent to low Earth orbit over the next decade, Yaney believes Spinlaunch’s time has come.</p><p> Yaney希望这是他获得辩护的一年。该公司计划于今年冬天在新墨西哥州的一个新试验场进行首次亚轨道发射。假设该系统正常运行，Spinlaunch承诺将将小型卫星送入太空的成本降低近20倍。但更大的问题可能是其发射节奏。雅尼（Yaney）预测，这种质量加速器每天将能够进行五次发射。大多数火箭弹公司一个月内不能进行那么多发射。在庞大的卫星星座时代，未来十年内将有成千上万的小型卫星送入近地轨道，Yaney认为Spinlaunch的时代已经来临。</p><p>  Like so many space entrepreneurs, Yaney has been obsessed with the cosmos all his life. But it took until 2014 for him to try to turn his passion into a career. According to Yaney, he had been struggling to build a media startup at the time. When he couldn&#39;t secure funding for it, he decided to move on. As he contemplated what to do next, Yaney’s mind turned again and again to a Cold War military project called HARP, in which the United States Army used a giant gun to shoot projectiles into space. HARP proved it was possible to get to space without a rocket, so Yaney set out to build a kinetic launch system of his own. He cobbled together a working proof of concept, essentially a motorized sling that could spin a bullet-sized projectile up to hypersonic speeds. He took it to a few angel investors and secured a small amount of funding.</p><p>  像许多太空企业家一样，Yaney一生都对宇宙充满痴迷。但是直到2014年，他才试图将自己的激情变成职业。根据Yaney的说法，当时他一直在努力建立一家媒体初创公司。当他无法为其筹集资金时，他决定继续前进。在考虑下一步行动时，雅尼的想法一次又一次转向了名为HARP的冷战军事项目，在该项目中，美国陆军使用巨型枪将弹丸射入太空。 HARP证明不用火箭就可以进入太空，因此Yaney着手建立自己的动力发射系统。他拼凑了一个可行的概念证明，本质上是一个电动吊索，可以将子弹大小的弹丸旋转至超音速。他把它带给了一些天使投资者，并获得了少量资金。</p><p>  But he needed help. In late 2014 he called up his old roommate from boarding school, Ryan Hampton, a whiz at construction and industrial operations. Hampton was running underwater welding operations on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico when Yaney made his pitch. As Hampton recalls, “He said, ‘I’ve got 4 million bucks and a crazy idea, want to come with me?’”</p><p>  但是他需要帮助。 2014年底，他召集了寄宿学校的老室友赖恩·汉普顿（Ryan Hampton），他是建筑和工业运营的专家。汉尼（Yaney）上场时，汉普顿（Hampton）在墨西哥湾的石油钻井平台上进行水下焊接作业。正如汉普顿回忆的那样，“他说，‘我有400万美元和一个疯狂的主意，想和我一起去吗？’”</p><p> Hampton couldn’t resist. In January 2015 he flew out to see what Yaney had built. It wasn’t much. Yaney showed off his tabletop centrifuge and shared his spreadsheets full of calculations. But Hampton was hooked: He saw that SpinLaunch was “gonna be one hell of a project,” and signed on as employee number one.</p><p>汉普顿无法抗拒。在2015年1月，他飞去查看Yaney的建筑。没什么Yaney展示了他的台式离心机，并共享了包含所有计算结果的电子表格。但是汉普顿很着迷：他看到SpinLaunch“将成为一个项目的地狱”，并以第一员工的身份签约。</p><p> Yaney had the ideas and Hampton the construction skills, but they still needed some aerospace engineers. So on a warm spring day a few months later, the pair climbed into Yaney’s Cessna and flew out to the edge of the Mojave desert, where dozens of college students had gathered to test their rockets. The duo was hoping to recruit a few of them.</p><p> 雅尼（Yaney）有想法，汉普顿（Hampton）具有建造技巧，但他们仍然需要一些航空航天工程师。因此，在几个月后的一个温暖的春日里，两人爬上了Yaney的塞斯纳（Cessna），飞到莫哈韦沙漠（Mojave desert）的边缘，数十名大学生聚集在那里测试他们的火箭。两人希望能招募其中一些人。</p><p> One of their targets was David Wrenn, a junior at San Diego State University. He had been doing phone interviews with SpinLaunch for weeks, and the circumstances weren’t ideal for an in-person interview. “I had been awake for like 36 hours at that point, so I was semi-insane when I met Jonathan,” Wrenn recalls. Still, the meeting went well. He took a leave of absence from college and flew out to San Francisco to join SpinLaunch, where he now works as a senior mechanical engineer.</p><p> 他们的目标之一是圣地亚哥州立大学大三的David Wrenn。他已经与SpinLaunch进行了电话采访数周，而这种情况对于面对面采访而言并不理想。 “那时我已经醒了36个小时，所以遇到乔纳森时我有些发疯，”韦恩回忆说。不过，会议进行得很顺利。他从大学请假，然后飞往旧金山加入SpinLaunch，在那里他现在担任高级机械工程师。</p><p>  Hampton says the early days of SpinLaunch reminded him a lot of life on an oil rig. Employees lived and worked at an old microprocessor plant SpinLaunch had taken over just down the road from the  Googleplex. When Wrenn arrived, the living spaces were spare. “At that point the kitchen was like a microwave and a plastic table,” he says. “You had to have a lot of vision or nothing to lose, one or the other.” When they weren’t working, the SpinLaunch crew lifted weights together in a makeshift gym, watched movies in a “home theater,” or relaxed around a fire pit—the converted remnants of Yaney’s original tabletop centrifuge.</p><p>  汉普顿说，SpinLaunch的早期使他想起了很多使用石油钻机的生活。员工在旧的微处理器工厂SpinLaunch居住和工作，该工厂从Googleplex接手而来。当Wrenn到达时，居住空间是多余的。他说：“那时的厨房就像微波炉和塑料桌子。” “您必须拥有远见或一无所失，一个或另一个。”当他们不工作时，SpinLaunch的工作人员在一个临时的健身房里一起举重，在“家庭影院”中看电影，或者在火坑旁放松-这些燃料是Yaney最初的台式离心机的残余部分。</p><p>  The team quickly ran into engineering challenges. The centrifuge they were building had to sit in a massive vacuum chamber to protect the system from air turbulence and stabilize it as it spun. When they approached contractors to build the chamber, they got one bid—with a price of $20 million.</p><p>  团队很快遇到了工程挑战。他们正在建造的离心机必须坐在一个巨大的真空室中，以保护系统免受空气湍流的影响并在旋转时使其稳定。当他们联系承包商建造该商会时，他们得到了一个要约，价格为2000万美元。</p><p> So the SpinLaunch team decided to build it themselves. As an underwater welder, Hampton had become an expert at crafting airtight seals, which translated well to his new task. Yaney ordered a few vacuum pumps off of eBay and $500,000 worth of steel, and the team set out to build the sixth-largest vacuum chamber, by diameter, in the world. It took them eight months. “I think we all began to realize that there are so many things in science and engineering that have to be uncovered, simply because people don&#39;t try them,” Yaney says.</p><p> 因此，SpinLaunch团队决定自行构建它。作为水下焊工，汉普顿已成为制作气密密封件的专家，这很好地体现了他的新任务。 Yaney从eBay上订购了一些真空泵和价值50万美元的钢材，该团队着手建造了世界上第六大真空室（按直径计）。他们花了八个月的时间。 Yaney说：“我认为我们所有人都已经开始意识到，科学和工程学中有很多事情需要揭开，仅仅是因为人们没有尝试过。”</p><p> In 2016 they completed their first centrifuge. At 40 feet in diameter, it’s still too small to hoist a rocket into space, but the fundamental design is the same. A long arm, called a tether, stretches out from an oil-slicked bearing powered by a motor. The payload attaches to the end of the tether. To withstand the enormous strain it will experience, the tether will have to be made of ultrastrong materials like Kevlar and carbon fiber.</p><p> 2016年，他们完成了第一台离心机。直径为40英尺，仍然太小，无法将火箭升入太空，但是基本设计是相同的。长臂（称为系绳）从由马达驱动的油污轴承中伸出。有效载荷附着在系绳的末端。为了承受巨大的压力，系绳必须由凯夫拉尔纤维和碳纤维等超强材料制成。</p><p>  After nearly two years of working 12 hours a day, six days a week, the SpinLaunch team was finally ready to fire up its first real centrifuge. “We were all huddled into a room about 50 feet away behind a bunch of monitors and cameras,” Yaney says. They checked that the system was in good shape, and then went for it. “We just hit the throttle and broke the world record for the fastest rotational system.”</p><p>经过一周，每天六天，每天12小时的工作近两年，SpinLaunch团队终于准备好启动其第一台真正的离心机。雅尼说：“我们都挤在一个距离约50英尺的房间里，后面是一堆显示器和摄像机。”他们检查系统是否状况良好，然后继续使用。 “我们刚刚踩下油门，就打破了最快旋转系统的世界纪录。”</p><p> Over the next few years, the team ran hundreds of high-speed tests. Most of them were to study and improve the system, but some were to mollify skeptical investors and potential customers who didn’t believe a payload could withstand the extreme forces. The team sent solar cells, radio systems, telescope lenses, batteries, GPS modules, and control computers whirling at high speeds; they all survived with little to no damage. In one test, Yaney attached an iPhone to the tether and spun it up until it experienced forces 10,000 times stronger than gravity. Afterward, he used the phone to FaceTime a colleague. Each test was a step, however small, toward space.</p><p> 在接下来的几年中，该团队进行了数百次高速测试。他们中的大多数人都在研究和改进该系统，但其中一些人则是为了安抚那些不相信有效载荷能够承受极端力量的持怀疑态度的投资者和潜在客户。该小组派出了高速旋转的太阳能电池，无线电系统，望远镜镜头，电池，GPS模块和控制计算机。他们都幸存下来，几乎没有伤害。在一项测试中，Yaney将iPhone固定在系绳上，然后旋转起来，直到承受的力量比重力大一倍。之后，他用电话给同事FaceTime。每个测试都是朝着空间迈出的一步，尽管步伐很小。</p><p>   In the center of SpinLaunch&#39;s cavernous warehouse, Yaney approached an object and pulled back its protective tarp. This, he proudly said, was “the worst rocket ever made.”</p><p>   在SpinLaunch海绵状仓库的中心，Yaney走近一个物体并拉回了它的防护油布。他自豪地说，这是“有史以来最糟糕的火箭”。</p><p>  About 25 feet long and solid black with a shiny silver tip, the rocket’s briolette shape looks bulky compared to the lithe, arrowlike forms of a typical rocket. In general, only a tiny part of a rocket’s mass can be its payload; most of the rest is its fuel. That’s why companies like SpaceX need a rocket as big as a building to carry a satellite the size of a car. In aerospace circles, this is known as the “tyranny of the rocket equation.”</p><p>  与典型火箭的轻巧，箭头状形式相比，该火箭的Briolette形状长约25英尺，黑色坚实，银色发光尖端，看上去很笨重。通常，火箭的有效载荷只有很小一部分。其余大部分是它的燃料。这就是为什么像SpaceX这样的公司需要像建筑物一样大的火箭来运载汽车大小的卫星的原因。在航空航天界，这被称为“火箭方程式的专制”。</p><p> But, as Yaney realized, if you can spirit a rocket to the edge of space without having to carry all the fuel to get there, the rocket can be stocky and more of its mass can be dedicated to the payload. Even better, the rocket’s engine doesn’t have to be that good. Whereas a regular orbital-class rocket is engineered to squeeze every last drop of efficiency from its engines to maximize its payload capacity while breaking the chains of gravity, most of the hard work for SpinLaunch’s rocket is done by the centrifuge.</p><p> 但是，正如Yaney所意识到的那样，如果您可以将火箭运送到太空的边缘而不必携带所有燃料到达那里，那么火箭可能会很矮胖，并且其更大的质量可以用于有效载荷。更好的是，火箭发动机不必那么好。常规的轨道级火箭经过精心设计，可以从引擎中压缩出最后的效率下降，以最大程度地提高其有效载荷能力，同时还能打破重力链，而SpinLaunch火箭的大部分艰苦工作都是由离心机完成的。</p><p> In SpinLaunch&#39;s design, once a rocket is spinning at launch speeds, an exit port in the centrifuge will open for a fraction of a second, sending the rocket shooting out. According to patents filed by the company, a counterbalance spinning opposite the rocket gets released at the same time, preventing the tether from becoming unbalanced and vibrating into oblivion. The rocket coasts for about a minute and ignites its engines at roughly 200,000 feet. At that altitude, there’s hardly any atmosphere pushing against the rocket, so a minute-long engine burn is about all it takes to boost the vehicle to orbital speeds of around 17,500 mph. Another burn, this one lasting just 10 seconds, helps the rocket slide into orbit around Earth.</p><p> 按照SpinLaunch的设计，一旦火箭以发射速度旋转，离心机的出口将打开一秒钟的时间，从而将火箭发射出去。根据该公司申请的专利，与火箭对置的平衡重同时被释放，从而防止系绳变得不平衡并振动而被遗忘。火箭滑行约一分钟，并在约200,000英尺处点燃其引擎。在这种高度下，几乎没有任何大气层会推动火箭飞行，因此大约一分钟的发动机燃烧就足以将汽车提升至约17,500 mph的轨道速度。持续仅10秒的另一次燃烧帮助火箭滑入地球轨道。</p><p>  Or so Yaney assures me. When I visited the company, the prototype centrifuge was still in pieces and Yaney wouldn’t show me any videos of it in action. Instead, he insisted the math of SpinLaunch engineers was solid. Major investors—including Airbus Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, and GV (part of Alphabet)—have given their blessing too, pumping $80 million into the company. And last year, the US Department of Defense awarded SpinLaunch a contract to help develop its centrifuge. Still, the scant public evidence that any of it works leaves much to the imagination.</p><p>  或是Yaney向我保证。当我访问该公司时，原型离心机仍处于碎片状态，Yaney不会向我展示任何有关其运行的视频。相反，他坚持认为SpinLaunch工程师的数学能力很强。包括空客创投，Kleiner Perkins和GV（Alphabet的一部分）在内的主要投资者也给予了他们很大的祝福，向公司注资8000万美元。去年，美国国防部授予SpinLaunch一份合同，以帮助其开发离心机。尽管如此，很少有公开证据表明它有任何作用仍然使想象力大打折扣。</p><p> Juan Alonso, an aerospace engineer at Stanford who did due diligence for one of SpinLaunch’s investors, understood my reservations. “It&#39;s an exotic technology, and the first time you hear about it you think there&#39;s no way that could possibly work,” he says. But after checking out the math himself, Alonso gave the investment firm the green light.</p><p>斯坦福大学的航空工程师胡安·阿隆索（Juan Alonso）对SpinLaunch的一位投资者进行了尽职调查，他理解了我的保留。他说：“这是一种奇特的技术，当您第一次听到它时，您认为没有办法行得通。”但是在亲自检查完数学后，阿隆索为这家投资公司开了绿灯。</p><p>  Although SpinLaunch is reluctant to share many hard numbers, two patents granted to the company in  2018 and  2019 offer some insight into its incredible physics. When I presented these patents to a number of aerospace engineers from leading research universities, however, most of them expressed skepticism.</p><p>  尽管SpinLaunch不愿分享许多困难的数字，但该公司分别于2018年和2019年获得了两项专利，从而对其不可思议的物理原理有所了解。但是，当我将这些专利提供给来自领先研究型大学的许多航空航天工程师时，他们中的大多数人对此表示怀疑。</p><p>  The biggest critique voiced by these engineers had to do with the forces the rocket will endure in the centrifuge. While the rocket spins, it will experience forces more than 10,000 times stronger than gravity. A typical rocket only has to deal with forces about five to seven times gravity during its journey to space. “No rocket could survive this, nor could the electronics inside the rocket,” says Dan Erwin, an aerospace engineer at the University of Southern California.</p><p>  这些工程师提出的最大的批评与火箭将在离心机中承受的力有关。火箭旋转时，它将承受比重力大一万倍的力。一枚典型的火箭在升空过程中只需要处理大约五到七倍重力的力即可。南加州大学的航空工程师丹·欧文（Dan Erwin）说：“没有火箭能够幸免，火箭内部的电子设备也无法幸免。”</p><p> One former employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to their nondisparagement and nondisclosure contracts, acknowledged the gulf between theory and reality. They described SpinLaunch’s prototype centrifuge as a relatively unsophisticated machine that “any average engineering team could put together.” The employee said that scaling up to a functional suborbital launcher is going to be “very challenging” with SpinLaunch’s resources. The employee also cited the inexperience of some of the leaders. “The foresight to predict many of the issues that are going to happen was definitely lacking,” they said.</p><p> 一位前雇员由于他们之间的无差异和保密协议而以匿名的身份发言，他承认理论与现实之间的鸿沟。他们将SpinLaunch的原型离心机描述为“任何普通工程团队都可以组装的”相对简单的机器。这位员工表示，使用SpinLaunch的资源，将其扩展到功能强大的亚轨道发射器将“非常具有挑战性”。该员工还列举了一些领导者的经验不足。他们说：“绝对没有预见到将要发生的许多问题的远见，”</p><p> Yaney has heard these criticisms before. He happens to see a lack of industry experience as an asset. “We’ve been putting together a team of engineers who, for the most part, are too young to say SpinLaunch couldn&#39;t work,” he says. “They’re full of too much energy and excitement to find out what&#39;s going to happen.”</p><p> Yaney以前曾听到过这些批评。他碰巧认为缺乏行业经验是一种资产。他说：“我们已经组建了一支工程师团队，这些工程师大多还太年轻，以至于不能说SpinLaunch无法工作。” “他们充满了精力和兴奋，无法找出即将发生的事情。”</p><p> As for the punishing forces, he points to the long history of launch vehicles that have weathered a journey to space similar to what a SpinLaunch vehicle will have to endure, including the US Army’s giant projectile-launching gun and modern guided munitions, which can handle forces thousands of times greater than gravity. Besides, he says his rocket will be more rugged than the average fragile launch vehicle—more like a missile than SpaceX’s Falcon 9.</p><p> 至于惩罚部队，他指出了运载火箭经历了漫长的太空飞行历史，这种运载火箭经历了类似于SpinLaunch运载工具所必须忍受的太空之旅，其中包括美国陆军的巨型弹药发射枪和可处理的现代制导弹药力比重力大数千倍。此外，他说，他的火箭将比普通的易碎运载火箭更坚固，比SpaceX的Falcon 9更像导弹。</p><p> As the iPhone demonstration attests, electronic components can survive the extreme forces during acceleration, though some more delicate electronics will need slight modifications. For example, the company has already filed patents for ruggedized  solar panels and  reaction wheels, which help satellites orient themselves.</p><p> 正如iPhone演示所证明的那样，尽管某些更精密的电子设备需要稍作改动，但电子组件可以在加速过程中承受极端的力。例如，该公司已经申请了加固型太阳能电池板和反作用轮的专利，这些专利可帮助卫星进行自我定位。</p><p> “This isn’t something new that SpinLaunch is doing—we are simply following in the footsteps of previous work,” Yaney says. Later this year, he plans to prove it during the system’s first suborbital launch.</p><p>Yaney说：“ SpinLaunch所做的并不是什么新事物，我们只是遵循先前工作的脚步而已。”今年晚些时候，他计划在该系统的第一次亚轨道发射中对其进行证明。</p><p>   Physics isn’t the only obstacle in the company’s path. Ultimately, SpinLaunch will need a coastal launch site, so the rockets don’t pose a threat to civilians. Finding a suitable location has been harder than Yaney anticipated. In April 2018, Hampton and Raphael Feldman, a project manager, traveled to Hawaii to seek permission to build such a facility on the Big Island. At first, the state was supportive, even drafting a  $25 million funding bill that would allow Hawaiians to invest in the company through government-backed bonds. But during a tense town hall meeting at the Naalehu Community Center on the Big Island, near the site SpinLaunch was after, residents barraged local government officials with accusations of corruption and concerns about how SpinLaunch’s operations would destroy local wildlife and pose a threat to islanders.</p><p>   物理并不是公司前进的唯一障碍。最终，SpinLaunch将需要一个沿海发射场，因此火箭不会对平民构成威胁。找到合适的位置比Yaney预期的难。 2018年4月，汉普顿（Hampton）和项目经理拉斐尔·费尔德曼（Raphael Feldman）前往夏威夷，寻求在大岛建造此类设施的许可。起初，该州提供了支持，甚至起草了一项2500万美元的融资法案，该法案将允许夏威夷人通过政府支持的债券对公司进行投资。但是，在紧挨着SpinLaunch所在地的大岛Naalehu社区中心举行的紧张的市政厅会议上，居民指责腐败的地方政府官员，并担心SpinLaunch的活动会破坏当地野生动植物并对岛民构成威胁。</p><p>  “If there is  any chance that a site in the county is chosen for this fly-by-night, ill-begotten project, I’ll tell you where you can find me,” one resident  said. “You can find me at the access gate where you paved over lava tubes and sacred grounds, and I will be attached to that gate with kryptonite locks and chains until you go away.”</p><p>  一位居民说：“如果有机会在这个夜深人迷的项目中选择县里的一块土地，我会告诉你在哪里可以找到我的。” “您可以在您盖过熔岩管和神圣地面的入口处找到我，然后我将被k石锁和铁链拴在那扇入口上，直到您离开。”</p><p>  The dismal town hall led to the collapse of the funding proposal, and SpinLaunch gave up on Hawaii. While the search for a coastal launch site continues, the company is building out a test site over land.</p><p>  惨淡的市政厅导致资助计划崩溃，SpinLaunch放弃了夏威夷。在继续寻找沿海发射场的同时，该公司正在陆地上建设一个测试场。</p><p> Last May, SpinLaunch broke ground at New Mexico’s  Spaceport America, where it is now building a centrifuge three times larger than the one in Los Angeles. Yaney hopes they will conduct their first suborbital flight tests later this year, launching projectiles weighing about 110 pounds over the nearby White Sands Missile Range. The tests would represent a significant step up from the 11-pound payloads it has experimented with so far. For the past few months, Hampton and about two dozen other employees have lived near the spaceport in a makeshift company town made of shipping containers. There’s a jacuzzi, an archery range, and a virtual reality room—small perks to make living in the middle of the desert a little more tolerable.</p><p> 去年五月，SpinLaunch在新墨西哥州的美国太空港破土动工，目前正在建造的离心机比洛杉矶的离心机大三倍。雅尼希望他们能在今年晚些时候进行第一次亚轨道飞行试验，在附近的白沙导弹靶场上发射重约110磅的弹丸。这些测试将是迄今为止迄今所试验的11磅有效载荷的重要一步。在过去的几个月中，汉普顿（Hampton）和其他大约二十多名员工住在由集装箱制成的临时公司镇的太空港附近。这里有一个按摩浴池，一个射箭场和一个虚拟现实室，这些特权使在沙漠中的生活更加宽容。</p><p> Yaney says he is confident the system will perform as expected, and they’ll soon be ready to line up customers. A ride to space with SpinLaunch will cost under $500,000 per launch, and Yaney says he is only looking to work with companies that want to launch dozens if not hundreds of satellites.</p><p> Yaney表示，他有信心该系统将按预期运行，并且他们很快就会准备好吸引客户。每次发射，使用SpinLaunch进行太空飞行的费用将低于50万美元，而Yaney说，他只希望与希望发射数十颗甚至数百颗卫星的公司合作。</p><p> Launching even one into orbit would be a major achievement. The history of private launch companies is largely a history of failure, but like some space-age Sisyphus, Yaney seems to embrace the struggle. Space exploration demands the boldness to venture into the unknown, and in SpinLaunch&#39;s case, the unknown is vast. The payoff, however, is nothing less than opening a new door to the cosmos.</p><p> 甚至将一颗发射到轨道将是一项重大成就。私人发射公司的历史很大程度上是失败的历史，但是像某些太空时代的西西弗斯一样，雅尼似乎也接受了斗争。太空探索需要大胆敢于探索未知事物，而在SpinLaunch的情况下，未知事物是巨大的。然而，回报无非是为宇宙打开了一扇新门。</p><p> Updated 1-29-20, 10am EST: This story was updated to reflect that both the satellite and rocket experience the force from acceleration.</p><p>美国东部标准时间上午10点1-29-20更新：更新了此故事以反映卫星和火箭都经历了加速度产生的力。</p><p> Updated 1-29-20, 9pm EST: This story was updated to correct information about the iPhone test.
