The Sargasso Sea is actually less a clearly defined body of water than a sea within a sea. Where it starts and where it ends is difficult to determine, since it eludes the usual measures of the world. It’s located slightly northeast of Cuba and the Bahamas, east of the North American coast, but it is also a place in flux. The Sargasso Sea is like a dream: you can rarely pinpoint the moment you enter or exit; all you know is that you’ve been there.</p><p>这就是鳗鱼诞生的方式：它发生在西北大西洋的一个地区，即所谓的Sargasso海，这个地方在各个方面都适合于鳗鱼的繁殖。 Sargasso海实际上不是一个明确定义的水域，而是海中的海。它的起点和终点很难确定，因为它没有采用世界上通常的措施。它位于古巴和巴哈马的东北方，北美洲海岸以东，但它也是一个不断变化的地方。 Sargasso Sea就像一个梦：您几乎无法指出进入或退出的那一刻；您所知道的只是您去过那里。</p><p> This impermanence is a result of the Sargasso’s being a sea without land borders; it is bounded instead by four mighty ocean currents. In the west by the life-giving Gulf Stream; in the north by its extension, the North Atlantic Drift; in the east by the Canary Current; and in the south by the North Equatorial Current. Two million square miles in size, the Sargasso Sea swirls like a slow, warm eddy inside this closed circle of currents. What gets in doesn’t always have an easy time getting out.</p><p> 这种无常是由于Sargasso的海洋无国界的缘故；相反，它受到四股强大的洋流的限制。在西部，有生命的海湾流；在北部的扩展，即北大西洋漂流；在金丝雀流的东部；而在南部则是北赤道洋流。面积为200万平方英里的Sargasso海像漩涡一样在这个封闭的洋流中缓慢而温暖地涡旋。进入并不总是很容易。</p><p> The water is deep blue and clear, in places very nearly 23,000 feet deep, and the surface is carpeted with vast fields of sticky brown algae called  Sargassum, which give the sea its name. Drifts of seaweed many thousands of feet across blanket the surface, providing nourishment and shelter for myriad creatures: tiny invertebrates, fish and jellyfish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs. Farther down in the deep, other kinds of seaweed and plants thrive. Life teems in the dark, like a nocturnal forest.</p><p> 水深蓝色且清澈，在近23,000英尺深的地方，地表覆盖着广阔的粘性褐藻海藻，称为Sargassum，因此而得名。海藻在表面覆盖了数千英尺，为无数生物提供了营养和庇护：微小的无脊椎动物，鱼类和水母，海龟，虾和螃蟹。在深处，其他种类的海藻和植物得以繁衍。生活在黑暗中繁茂，就像一个夜森林。</p><p>  This is where the European eel,  Anguilla anguilla, is born. This is where mature eels breed in the spring and their eggs are laid and fertilized. Here, safe in the darkness of the depths, small larva-like creatures with disturbingly tiny heads and poorly developed eyes spring to life. They’re called leptocephalus larvae and have a body like a willow leaf, flat and virtually transparent, only a few millimeters long. This is the first stage of the eel’s life cycle.</p><p>  这是欧洲鳗，（Anguilla anguilla）的出生地。在这里，成熟的鳗鱼在春季繁殖，并产卵并受精。在这里，即使在深处的黑暗中也很安全，像幼虫一样的小型生物，其头部令人不安的小巧而发育不良的眼睛却栩栩如生。它们被称为细头幼虫，其身体像柳叶一样，平坦而几乎透明，只有几毫米长。这是鳗鱼生命周期的第一阶段。</p><p>   The gossamer willow leaves immediately set off on their journey. Swept up by the Gulf Stream, they drift thousands of miles across the Atlantic toward the coasts of Europe. It’s a journey that can take as long as three years; during this time, each larva slowly grows, millimeter by millimeter, like a gradually inflating balloon, and when at last it reaches Europe, it undergoes its first metamorphosis, transforming into a glass eel. This is the second stage of the eel’s life cycle.</p><p>   游丝柳叶随即启程。它们被海湾流所掠，漂流了数千英里，横跨大西洋，朝着欧洲海岸前进。这可能需要长达三年的时间。在此期间，每个幼虫都像毫米气球一样逐渐膨胀，逐渐成长，直到最后到达欧洲，才经历了第一次变态，变成了玻璃鳗。这是鳗鱼生命周期的第二阶段。</p><p>  Glass eels are, much like their willow leaf former selves, almost entirely transparent, two to three inches in length, elongated and slithery, transparent, as though neither color nor sin has yet to take root in their bodies. They look, in the words of the marine biologist Rachel Carson, like “thin glass rods, shorter than a finger.” Frail and seemingly defenseless, they are considered a delicacy by, among other people, the Basques. When a glass eel reaches the coasts of Europe, it will usually travel up a brook or river, adapting almost instantly to a freshwater existence. This is where it undergoes yet another metamorphosis, turning into a yellow eel. Its body grows serpentine and muscular. Its eyes remain relatively small, with a distinctive dark center. Its jaw becomes wide and powerful. Its gills are small and almost completely concealed. Thin, soft fins stretch along the entirety of its back and belly. Its skin finally develops pigment, coloring it shades of brown, yellow, and gray, and it becomes covered in scales so tiny they can be neither seen nor felt, like an imaginary armor. If the glass eel is tender and fragile, the yellow eel is strong and sturdy. This is the third stage of the eel’s life cycle.</p><p>  玻璃鳗鱼就像它们的柳叶制成的自我一样，几乎完全透明，长两到三英寸，细长而结实，透明，好像颜色和罪恶都还没有在他们的体内扎根。用海洋生物学家雷切尔·卡森（Rachel Carson）的话来说，它们看起来像“比手指短的细玻璃棒”。他们身体虚弱，貌似毫无防御能力，被巴斯克人视为美味佳肴。当一只玻璃鳗到达欧洲海岸时，通常会沿着一条小溪或河上行进，几乎立即适应淡水的存在。在这里它又经历了另一个变态，变成了黄e。它的身体长成蛇形和肌肉。它的眼睛相对较小，并具有明显的深色中心。它的下巴变得宽而有力。它的腮很小，几乎完全被隐藏。薄而柔软的鳍片沿其整个背部和腹部伸展。它的皮肤最终形成色素，将其着色为褐色，黄色和灰色，并且被鳞片覆盖，以至于它们既看不见也感觉不到，就像假想的盔甲一样。如果玻璃鳗鱼嫩而易碎，则黄色鳗鱼既坚固又结实。这是鳗鱼生命周期的第三阶段。</p><p>  The yellow eel is able to move through the shallowest, most overgrown waters as well as the swiftest currents. It can swim through murky lakes and up tranquil streams, up wild rivers and through lukewarm ponds. When needed, it can pass through swamps and ditches. It doesn’t let circumstance stand in its way, and when all aquatic possibilities have been exhausted, it can take to dry land, slithering through moist brush and grass in pushes toward new waters that can last for hours. The eel is, thus, a fish that transcends the piscine condition. Perhaps it doesn’t even realize it is a fish.</p><p>  黄鳗能够穿越最浅，最茂密的水域和最迅捷的水流。它可以在漆黑的湖泊和宁静的溪流，狂野的河流以及温水的池塘中游泳。需要时，它可以穿过沼泽和沟渠。它不会让情况受阻，当所有水生生物都用尽后，它可以将土地干燥，通过潮湿的刷子和草丛滑行，推向可能持续数小时的新水域。因此，鳗鱼是超越鱼类状况的鱼类。也许甚至没有意识到这是一条鱼。 </p><p> It can migrate thousands of miles, unflagging and undaunted, before it suddenly decides it’s found a home. It doesn’t require much of this home; the environs are something to adapt to, to endure and get to know—a muddy stream or lake bed, preferably with some rocks and hollows to hide in, and enough food. Once it has found its home, it stays there, year after year, and normally wanders within a radius of only a few hundred yards. If relocated by external forces, it will invariably return as quickly as it can to its chosen abode. Eels caught by researchers, tagged with radio transmitters, and released many miles from their point of capture have been known to return to where they were first found within a week or two. No one knows exactly how they find their way.</p><p>在突然决定找到家之前，它可以迁移数千英里，毫不费力，毫不畏惧。它不需要太多的家周围环境可以适应，忍受和了解-泥泞的溪流或湖床，最好有一些岩石和空洞可以藏起来，并有足够的食物。一旦找到自己的家，它便会年复一年地呆在那里，并且通常会在几百码的半径内徘徊。如果被外力重新安置，它将始终尽可能快地返回其选定的住所。研究人员发现，鳗鱼被无线电发射器标记，并从捕获点释放了许多英里，这些鳗鱼会在一两周内返回到首次发现的地方。没有人确切地知道他们如何找到自己的道路。</p><p>  The yellow eel is a solitary creature. It usually lives out the active phase of its life alone, letting the passing seasons dictate its activities. When the temperature drops, it can lie motionless in the mud for long periods, utterly passive, and at times entangled with other eels like a messy ball of yarn.</p><p>  黄鳗是一种孤独的生物。它通常只活在生命的活跃阶段，让流逝的季节决定它的活动。当温度下降时，它可能会长时间不动地躺在泥浆中，完全是被动的，有时还像杂乱的毛线球一样缠在其他鳗鱼上。</p><p>  It is a nocturnal hunter. At dusk, it emerges from the sediment and starts looking for food, eating whatever it can find. Worms, larvae, frogs, snails, insects, crayfish, fish, as well as mice and baby birds when given the chance. It is not above scavenging.</p><p>  这是一个夜间狩猎者。黄昏时分，它从沉积物中出来，开始寻找食物，吃掉一切。如果有机会，蠕虫，幼虫，青蛙，蜗牛，昆虫，小龙虾，鱼以及老鼠和幼鸟。这不是清除。</p><p> In this way, the eel lives out the greater part of its life in a brownish-yellow guise, alternating between activity and hibernation. Seemingly lacking any sense of purpose, other than in its daily search for food and shelter. As though life was first and foremost about waiting and its meaning found in the gaps or in an abstract future that can’t be brought about by any means other than patience.</p><p> 通过这种方式，鳗鱼以棕黄色的外观活出了生命的大部分，在活动和冬眠之间交替进行。除了每天寻找食物和住所以外，似乎没有任何目的感。生命似乎首先是关于等待的，它的含义是在空白中或在抽象的未来中发现的，除了耐心以外，其他任何方式都无法实现。</p><p> And it’s a long life. An eel that successfully avoids illness and calamity can live for up to fifty years in one place. There are Swedish eels who have made it past eighty in captivity. Myths and legends tell of eels living to a hundred or more. When an eel is denied a way to achieve its main purpose in life—procreation—it seems able to live forever. As though it could wait until the end of time.</p><p> 而且寿命长。成功避免疾病和灾难的鳗鱼可以在一个地方生存长达五十年。有瑞典鳗鱼被囚禁了八十多年。神话传说说鳗鱼活到一百或更多。当鳗鱼被剥夺了实现生活中主要目的的一种途径-繁殖时，它似乎可以永远活着。好像它可以等到时间的尽头。</p><p>  But at some point in its life, usually after 15 to 30 years, a wild eel will suddenly decide to reproduce. What triggers this decision, we may never know, but once it has been made, the eel’s tranquil existence ends abruptly and its life takes on a different character. It starts making its way back to the sea while simultaneously undergoing its final metamorphosis. The drab and indeterminate yellowish-brown of its skin disappears, its coloring grows clearer and more distinct, its back turns black and its sides silver, marked with stripes, as though its entire body changes to reflect its newfound determination. The yellow eel becomes a silver eel. This is the fourth stage of the eel’s life cycle.</p><p>  但通常在15至30年后的某个生命中，野生鳗鱼会突然决定繁殖。我们可能永远不知道是什么触发了这个决定，但是一旦作出决定，鳗鱼的平静生活就会突然结束，其生活将呈现出不同的特征。它开始返回大海，同时经历了最终的变态。皮肤的单调和不确定的黄褐色消失，颜色变得更清晰更鲜明，背部变成黑色，侧面银色，带有条纹，好像整个身体都在变化以反映新发现。黄e变成白a。这是鳗鱼生命周期的第四阶段。</p><p>  When autumn rolls out its protective darkness, the silver eels wander back out into the Atlantic and set off toward the Sargasso Sea. And as though through deliberate choice, the eel’s body adapts to the conditions of the journey. Only now do its reproductive organs develop; its fins grow longer and more powerful to help propel it; its eyes grow larger and turn blue to help it see better in the depths of the ocean; its digestive system shuts down; its stomach dissolves—from now on, all the energy it needs will be taken from existing fat reserves—its body fills with roe or milt. No external interference can distract the eel from its goal.</p><p>  当秋天散发出保护性的黑暗时，银鳗els游回大西洋，驶向萨尔加索海。而且，通过精心的选择，鳗鱼的身体可以适应旅途的状况。直到现在，它的生殖器官才发育。它的鳍长得更长，更强大以帮助推动它；它的眼睛变大了，变成了蓝色，以帮助在海洋深处看得更好。消化系统关闭；它的胃溶解了-从现在开始，它需要的所有能量都将从现有的脂肪储备中吸收-它的身体充满了鱼卵或麦芽。任何外部干扰都不能使鳗鱼偏离目标。 </p><p> It swims as much as 30 miles a day, sometimes as deep as 3,000 feet below the surface; we still know very little about this journey. It may make the trip in six months or it may stop for winter. It has been shown that a silver eel in captivity can live for up to four years without any nourishment at all.</p><p>它每天游泳长达30英里，有时甚至深达水面以下3,000英尺；我们对这次旅行仍然知之甚少。它可能会在六个月内完成行程，或者可能会在冬季停止。已经证明，圈养中的银鳗可以在没有任何营养的情况下生存长达四年。</p><p>  It’s a long, ascetic journey, undertaken with an existential resolve that cannot be explained. But once an eel reaches the Sargasso Sea, it has, once again, found its way home. Under swirling blankets of seaweed, its eggs are fertilized. And with that, the eel is done, its story complete, and it dies.</p><p>  这是一个漫长而苦行的旅程，它的存在存在着无法解释的决心。但是，一旦鳗鱼到达了Sargasso海，它就再次找到了回家的路。在旋转的海藻毛毯下，其卵受精。这样，鳗鱼就完成了，故事完成了，死了。</p><p>  My father taught me to fish for eel in the stream bordering the fields of his childhood home. We drove down at dusk in August, taking a left off the main road to cross the stream and turning onto a small road that was little more than a tractor path in the dirt winding down a steep slope and then moving parallel with the water. On our left were the fields, the golden wheat brushing against the side of our car; on our right, the quietly hissing grass. Beyond it, the water, around 20 feet wide, a tranquil stream meandering through the greenery like a silver chain glinting in the last slanted rays of the setting sun.</p><p>  父亲教我在他童年时家的田野附近的溪流中钓鱼。我们在八月的黄昏开车驶下，沿主要道路左转横过溪流，转入一条小路，该路只不过是一条拖拉机路，在尘土中蜿蜒成陡峭的斜坡，然后与水平行移动。在我们的左边是田野，金色的麦子在我们车的侧面掠过。在我们右边，悄悄的嘶嘶声除此之外，约20英尺宽的水流从一条绿意盎然的溪流蜿蜒而过，犹如一条银链在夕阳的最后倾斜光线中闪烁。</p><p>  We drove slowly along the rapids, where the stream rushed in a startled fashion between the rocks and past the twisted old willow tree. I was seven years old and had already gone down this same road many times before. When the tracks ended in a wall of impenetrable vegetation, Dad turned off the engine and everything went dark and still, aside from the murmur of the stream. We were both wearing wellies and greasy vinyl waders, mine yellow and his orange, and we took two black buckets full of fishing gear, a flashlight, and a jar of worms from the trunk and set off.</p><p>  我们沿着急流缓慢行驶，溪流以惊人的速度冲过岩石之间，经过扭曲的老柳树。我当时只有七岁，之前已经走过同一条路。当铁轨在无法穿透的植被墙中结束时，爸爸关掉了引擎，除了小溪的杂音，一切都变得一片漆黑。我们俩都穿着便服和油腻的乙烯基涉水玩具，我的黄色和他的橙色，我们从行李箱中拿出两个黑色的水桶，里面装满渔具，一个手电筒和一罐蠕虫，然后出发。</p><p>  Along the bank of the stream, the grass was wet and impenetrable and taller than me. Dad took the lead, forging a path; the vegetation closed like an arch above me as I followed. Bats flitted back and forth above the stream, silent, like black punctuation marks against the sky.</p><p>  沿着小溪的河岸，草比我湿，坚不可摧，高。爸爸带头，开辟了一条道路。当我跟随时，植被像我上面的拱门一样闭合。蝙蝠在溪流上来回飞舞，无声，像黑色的标点符号在天空上飞舞。</p><p> After 40 yards, Dad stopped and looked around. “This’ll do,” he said.</p><p> 40码后，爸爸停下来四处张望。他说：“会的。”</p><p> The bank was steep and muddy. If you missed your step, you ran the risk of falling over and sliding straight into the water. Twilight was already falling.</p><p> 银行陡峭而泥泞。如果错过了脚步，则可能会跌倒并直接滑入水中。暮光已经落下。 </p><p> Dad held the grass back with one hand and carefully walked down on a diagonal, then turned around and held his other hand out to me. I took it and followed with the same practiced caution. Down by the water’s edge, we trampled out a small ledge and set down our buckets.</p><p>爸爸用一只手把草放回去，小心地沿着对角线走下，然后转过身，另一只手向我伸出来。我接受了它，并遵循同样的谨慎态度。在水边，我们践踏了一个小壁架，放下水桶。</p><p>  I imitated Dad, who was mutely inspecting the water, following his eyes, imagining I saw what he saw. There was, of course, no way of knowing whether this was a good spot. The water was dark, and here and there stands of reeds stuck out of it, waving menacingly, but everything below the surface was hidden from us. We had no way of knowing, but we chose to have faith as from time to time a person must. Fishing is often about exactly that.</p><p>  我模仿爸爸，他默默地检查着水，跟随着他的眼睛，想象着我看到了他所看到的。当然，没有办法知道这是否是一个好地方。水是黑暗的，到处都是芦苇，险恶的挥舞着芦苇丛生，但是水面以下的一切都对我们隐藏了。我们没有办法知道，但是我们选择拥有一个人不时必须拥有的信仰。钓鱼通常就是这样。</p><p>  “Yes, this’ll do,” Dad repeated, turning to me; I pulled a spiller from the bucket and handed it to him. He pushed the stake into the ground and quickly gathered up the line, picked up the hook, and gingerly pulled a fat worm out of the jar. He bit his lip and studied the worm in the flashlight; after putting it on the hook, he held it up to his face and pretended to spit on it for luck, always twice, before throwing it into the water with a sweeping motion. He bent down and touched the line, making sure it was taut and hadn’t traveled too far in the current. Then he straightened back up and said “All right,” and we climbed back up the bank.</p><p>  “是的，这样做。”爸爸重复道，转向我；我从水桶里拉了一个溢出物，交给了他。他把木桩推到地上，迅速收起绳子，捡起钩子，小心翼翼地从罐子里拔出一根肥虫。他咬住嘴唇，用手电筒研究蠕虫。将它放在钩子上后，他举起它的脸，假装经常向它吐两次以求好运，然后以大幅度的动作将其扔入水中。他弯下腰​​摸摸线，确保线拉紧并且在当前距离内没有走得太远。然后他伸直身子说：“好吧，”然后我们又爬上了银行。</p><p> What we called spillers were really something else, I suppose. The word  spiller usually denotes a long fishing line with many hooks and sinkers. Our version was more primitive. Dad made them by sharpening one end of a piece of wood with an ax. Then he cut a length of thick nylon line, about 15 feet, and tied one end to the wooden stake. He made the sinkers by pouring melted lead into a steel pipe and letting it set before cutting the pipe into short pieces that he would then drill a hole through. The sinker was placed about a hand’s length from the end of the line and the fairly sizable single hook right fastened at the end. The stake was hammered into the ground, the hook with the worm rested on the streambed. We would bring ten or twelve spillers, which we’d bait and throw in, one after the other, approximately 30 feet apart. Up and down the steep bank, the same laborious procedure each time and the same well-rehearsed hand-holding, the same gestures and the same spitting for luck.</p><p> 我想，我们所谓的“溢出者”确实是另外一回事。溢出这个词通常表示一条长长的钓鱼线，上面有许多钩子和坠子。我们的版本比较原始。爸爸用斧头削了一块木头的一端来制成它们。然后，他剪了一条长约15英尺的粗尼龙线，并将一端绑在木桩上。他通过将熔化的铅倒入钢管中并使其凝固后再将其切割成短片，然后钻一个孔来制成沉降片。沉降片放置在距线尾约一手的长度处，并在尾端右端固定了相当大的单个钩子。把木桩锤打在地上，蠕虫钩在河床上。我们会带十到十二个溢出物，我们将它们诱饵并相距约30英尺的距离扔掉。在陡峭的河岸上下，每次都要进行相同的繁琐程序，并且要进行同样的排练，相同的手势和运气。</p><p>  When the last spiller had been set up, we went back the same way, up and down the bank, checking each one again. Carefully testing each line to make sure there hadn’t been a bite already and then standing around for a minute in silence, letting our instinct convince us that this was good, that something would happen here if we just gave it some time. By the time we’d checked the last one, it would be completely dark—the silent bats visible now only when they swooped through the shaft of moonlight—and we climbed up the bank one final time, walked back to the car, and drove home.</p><p>  设置完最后一个溢出器后，我们以相同的方式在银行上下移动，再次检查每个溢出器。仔细测试每条线，以确保没有咬人，然后静静地站一分钟，让我们的直觉说服我们这很好，如果我们稍等片刻，这会发生什么。等到我们检查了最后一个时，它已经完全黑了-只有当蝙蝠俯冲穿过月光轴时，才可见到那只寂静的蝙蝠。我们最后一次爬上岸，回到车上，开车家。</p><p> I can’t recall us ever talking about anything other than eels and how to best catch them, down there by the stream. I can’t remember us speaking at all.</p><p> 我不记得我们曾经谈论过鳗鱼以外的事情，以及如何在河边顺便抓住它们。我完全不记得我们讲话了。</p><p>   Maybe because we never did. Because we were in a place where the need for talking was limited, a place whose nature was best enjoyed in silence. The reflected moonlight, the hissing grass, the shadows of the trees, the monotonous rushing of the stream, and the bats like hovering asterisks above it all. You had to be quiet to make yourself part of the whole.</p><p>   也许是因为我们从未这样做过。因为我们处在谈话需求有限的地方，所以这里的自然最好在沉默中享受。反射的月光，嘶嘶的草丛，树木的阴影，溪流的单调奔流以及蝙蝠像在其上方盘旋的星号一样。您必须保持安静才能使自己成为整体的一部分。 </p><p>  It could, of course, also be because I remember everything wrong. Because memory is an unreliable thing that picks and chooses what to keep. When we look for a scene from the past, it is by no means certain that we end up recalling the most important or the most relevant; rather, we remember what fits into the preconceived image that we have. Our memory paints a tableau in which the various details inevitably complement one another. Memory doesn’t allow colors that clash with the background. So let’s just say we were silent. In any case, I don’t know what we might have talked about if we did.</p><p>当然，这也可能是因为我记得所有错误。因为内存是一种不可靠的事情，它会选择要保留的内容。当我们寻找过去的一幕时，绝对不能使我们回想起最重要或最相关的事物。相反，我们记得什么适合我们所拥有的先入为主的形象。我们的记忆描绘出一种画面，其中各种细节不可避免地相互补充。内存不允许与背景颜色冲突的颜色。因此，我们只是保持沉默。无论如何，我不知道如果我们这样做了。</p><p> We lived just a mile or two from the stream; when we got home late at night, we would pull off our wellies and waders on the front steps, and I would go straight to bed. I’d fall asleep quickly, and just after five in the morning, Dad would wake me up again. He didn’t need to say much. I got out of bed straight away, and we were in the car a few minutes later. Down by the stream, the sun was rising. Dawn colored the lower edge of the sky a deep orange, and the water seemed to rush by with a different sound, clearer, brighter, as though it had just woken up from a deep sleep. Other sounds could be heard all around us. A blackbird warbling, a mallard entering the water with a clumsy splash. A heron flying silently over the stream, peering down with its large beak like a raised dagger.</p><p> 我们离小河只有一英里或两英里。当我们深夜回到家时，我们会在前面的台阶上脱掉尿布和涉水，我会直接上床睡觉。我很快就入睡了，早上五点钟，爸爸又把我叫醒了。他不需要多说。我立刻下床，几分钟后我们上了车。在小河的下游，太阳升起了。黎明将天空的下边缘染成深橙色，水似乎以一种不同的声音奔腾而过，声音更加清晰，明亮，好像刚从沉睡中醒来一样。我们周围都能听到其他声音。一只黑war war，一只野鸭进入水中，笨拙的飞溅。一只苍鹭静静地飞过溪流，凝视着它的大喙，像凸起的匕首。</p><p>  We walked through the damp grass and stomped our way sideways down the bank to the first spiller. Dad waited for me, and together we studied the taut line, looking for signs of activity under the surface. Dad bent down and put his hand to the nylon. Then he straightened back up and shook his head. He pulled the line in and held up the hook for me to see. The worm was gone, probably stolen by crafty roaches.</p><p>  我们穿过湿润的草丛，沿着河岸向一侧踩到第一个溢出者。爸爸在等我，我们一起研究了绷紧的绳索，寻找海面下活动的迹象。爸爸弯下腰，把手放在尼龙上。然后他挺直身子，摇了摇头。他拉了进去，高高挂起，让我看看。蠕虫消失了，很可能被狡猾的蟑螂偷走了。</p><p> We moved on to the next spiller, which was also empty. As was the third. Approaching the fourth one, however, we could see the line had been dragged into a stand of reeds; when Dad pulled on it, it was stuck. He muttered something inaudible. Grabbed the line with both hands and tugged a bit harder, to no avail. The current might have carried the hook and sinker into the reeds. But it might also have been that an eel had swallowed the hook and gotten itself and the line caught up in the plant stalks and was now lying there, bid-ing its time. If you held the line taut in your hand, you could sometimes feel tiny movements, as though whatever was stuck below the surface on the other end was bracing itself.</p><p> 我们继续前进到下一个也是空的溢出器。和第三次一样。然而，快到第四节了，我们可以看到这条线被拖进了芦苇丛中。当爸爸拉它时，它被卡住了。他喃喃地说出一些听不见的东西。双手抓住线，用力拉一点，无济于事。潮流可能把钩子和坠子带进了芦苇丛中。但是也可能是鳗鱼吞下了钩子，钩住了自己，钓线陷入了植物的茎杆，现在躺在那里，等待时间。如果将绳索拉紧，有时可能会感觉到微小的晃动，好像另一端的表面下面的东西正在支撑自己。</p><p>  Dad coaxed and pulled, bit his lip and cursed helplessly. He knew there were only two ways out of this situation and that both had its losers. Either he managed to dislodge the eel and pull it up, or he could cut the line and leave the eel where it was, tangled in the reeds with the hook and heavy sinker like a ball and chain.</p><p>  爸爸哄着拉了一下，咬了咬嘴唇，无奈地诅咒着。他知道只有两种方法可以解决这种情况，并且都有失败者。他要么设法移走鳗鱼，然后将其拉起，要么可以剪断线，将鳗鱼留在原处，用钩子和沉重的沉降片缠在芦苇上，就像球和链子一样。</p><p>  This time, there seemed to be no other option. Dad took a few steps to the side, trying a different angle, pulling so hard the nylon stretched like a violin string. Nothing worked.</p><p>  这次，似乎别无选择。爸爸向侧面走了几步，尝试了一个不同的角度，用力拉着尼龙，像小提琴弦一样伸展。没事。</p><p> “Nope, no luck,” he said at length and tugged as hard as he could, breaking the line in two with a loud snap.</p><p> “不，没有运气。”他漫不经心地说，尽力用力，用一声响亮的声音将线一分为二。 </p><p> “Let’s hope it makes it,” he said, and we moved on, climbing up and down the bank.</p><p>他说：“希望它能实现。”我们继续前进，在银行上下攀爬。</p><p> At the fifth spiller, Dad bent down and tentatively touched the line. Then he straightened up and stepped aside. “You want to take this one?” he said.</p><p> 在第五个溢出者处，爸爸弯下腰，暂时碰触了队伍。然后他站起身，走到了一边。 “你想吃这个吗？”他说。</p><p>  I grabbed the line and pulled on it gently and could immediately feel the strength that answered back. The same force that Dad had felt with just his fingertips. I had time to realize that the feeling was familiar, then I pulled a bit harder and the fish began to move. “It’s an eel,” I said out loud.</p><p>  我抓住线，轻轻拉动它，马上就能感觉到回音的力量。爸爸只用指尖就感受到了同样的力量。我有时间意识到这种感觉很熟悉，然后我用力拉了一点，鱼开始移动。 “是一条鳗鱼。”我大声说。</p><p> An eel never tries to rush, as a pike might; it prefers slithering sideways, which creates a kind of undulating resistance. It’s surprisingly strong for its size and a good swimmer, despite its tiny fins.</p><p> 鳗鱼从不试图冲刺，就像梭子鱼一样。它更喜欢侧滑，从而产生一种起伏的阻力。尽管鳍片很小，但它的大小和出色的游泳者都令人惊讶地坚固。</p><p> I reeled it in as slowly as I could, without letting the line slacken, as though savoring the moment. But it was a short line, and there were no reeds for this eel to hide in; before long, I pulled it out of the water and saw its shiny yellowish-brown body twisting in the early-morning light. I tried to grab it behind its head, but it was virtually impossible to hold. It wrapped itself around my arm like a snake, up past my elbow; I could feel its strength like a static force more than movement. If I dropped it now, it would escape through the grass and back into the water before I could get a secure hold.</p><p> 我尽可能缓慢地卷入，不让线松弛，仿佛在品味那一刻。但这是一条短线，没有一条芦苇可以让这只鳗鱼躲藏起来。不久，我将其从水中拉出，看到它的光泽的黄褐色身体在晨曦中扭曲。我试图抓住它的头，但是几乎不可能握住它。它像蛇一样缠绕在我的手臂上，越过肘部。我可以感觉到它的力量像静力而不是运动。如果我现在放下它，它会从草丛中逸出并回到水中，然后才能稳固地固定住。</p><p>  In the end, we got the hook out and Dad filled the bucket with water from the stream. I slipped the eel in, and it immediately started swimming around and around the inside; Dad put his hand on my shoulder, said it was a beauty. We moved on to the next spiller, stepping lightly up the bank. And I got to carry the bucket.</p><p>  最后，我们把钩子钩了出来，爸爸用溪流中的水装满了水桶。我把鳗鱼滑进去，它立即开始在里面和周围游泳。爸爸把手放在我的肩膀上，说那是美丽。我们继续前进到下一个溢出者，轻轻踩到银行。我必须提起水桶。</p><p>    From the book  The Book of Eels  by Patrik Svensson.
