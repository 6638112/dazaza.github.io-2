As a luxury—​like coffee, tulips, and spices—​the more expensive fur got, the more people wanted it. As prices doubled in both the London and the Paris markets over the eighteenth century, the number of furs crossing the Atlantic quadrupled. From just two ports on Hudson’s Bay, furs shipped each season increased from two thousand pelts in 1710 to fifty thousand pelts by 1740. Combined with the less recorded but still vast trade from the smaller French companies that operated around the Great Lakes, somewhere between 400,000 and one million animal skins left North America each year during most of the eighteenth century. The trade would eventually deplete the supply of animals, but only after another century of steady expansion.</p><p>随着18世纪美洲原住民和欧洲人之间暂时的和平为北美毛皮贸易的扩大创造了条件，欧洲对毛皮的需求激增。作为奢侈品-​比如咖啡、郁金香和香料-​毛皮越贵，人们就越想要它。随着伦敦和巴黎市场的价格在18世纪翻了一番，穿越大西洋的皮草数量翻了四倍。从哈德逊湾的两个港口到1740年，每个季节运送的毛皮从1710年的2000毛皮增加到了5万毛皮。再加上在五大湖地区经营的法国小公司的贸易记录较少，但规模仍然很大，在18世纪的大部分时间里，每年大约有40万到100万张兽皮离开北美。这种贸易最终会耗尽动物的供应，但只有在又一个世纪的稳步扩张之后。</p><p> A dense human network evolved to hunt, kill, package, ship, and make clothing from millions of beavers, martens, and minks. Brave or desperate young men left home to live among Native American people who didn’t speak French or English. They left from docks along the St. Lawrence or from Hudson’s Bay in small canoes filled with Crees, Ojibwes, or Hurons. From the moment they arrived at Hudson’s Bay, where large Cree settlements encircled the trading posts, or at the edge of Lake Ontario, where Ojibwe and Odawa villages lined the shore, European men entered a new world. Native people knew that landscape like they knew their own skins, and the fur trade made that knowledge valuable. A young Hudson’s Bay Company officer admitted that “we would have starved if we did not send out those Indians that keep constant attendance to shoot geese and hares.”</p><p>一个密集的人类网络进化成了用数百万只海狸、马丁鱼和水貂捕猎、捕杀、包装、运输和制作衣服的网络。勇敢或绝望的年轻人离开家，与不会说法语或英语的美洲原住民生活在一起。他们从圣劳伦斯沿岸的码头或哈德逊湾出发，乘坐装满克里斯河、奥吉布韦河或休伦河的小独木舟。从他们抵达哈德逊湾（Hudson’s Bay）或安大略湖（Lake Ontario）边缘（Ojibwe村和Odawa村位于岸边）的那一刻起，欧洲人就进入了一个新世界。当地人对风景了如指掌，就像他们对自己的皮肤了如指掌一样，毛皮贸易使这些知识变得有价值。一位年轻的哈德逊湾公司官员承认，“如果我们不派遣那些经常出勤射杀鹅和兔的印第安人，我们就会挨饿。”</p><p> The mixed-​descent families made in a Native world were a key component of the global fur trade. Every winter produced a harvest of furs, new relationships, and babies. Every spring European men filled their canoes with furs and hides, dried and pressed into ninety-​pound packs. Their local partners loaded household goods and children to move to summer villages, now located near trading depots like Michilimackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan come together. In 1763 a British census estimated that more than fifty thousand Native people lived by hunting and growing crops around the Great Lakes. That population overwhelmed the perhaps two thousand European men who lived among them.</p><p>混血儿-​在本土建立的世系家庭是全球毛皮贸易的关键组成部分。每年冬天都会收获毛皮、新的关系和婴儿。每年春天，欧洲人都会在独木舟上装满毛皮和兽皮，晒干后压成九十块-​一磅装。他们的当地合作伙伴装载家用物品和孩子搬到避暑村，避暑村现在位于米奇利马基诺等贸易站附近，休伦湖和密歇根湖在这里汇合。1763年，英国的一次人口普查估计，五万多土著人靠在五大湖周围狩猎和种植庄稼为生。这些人口超过了生活在他们中间的大约2000名欧洲男子。</p><p> Marrying and bearing children together didn’t end violence between indigenous and European Americans. In the 1750s, when colonial wars replaced Indian peace, the means to survive the violence became personal. Indian women, making choices that benefited their families and nations, took risks to weave new families from strangers arriving in their villages and from fur traders who wanted clan business.</p><p>结婚生子并没有结束土著和欧洲裔美国人之间的暴力冲突。17世纪50年代，殖民战争取代了印度的和平，暴力的生存手段变成了个人的。印度妇女做出了有益于家庭和国家的选择，她们冒着风险，从来到自己村庄的陌生人和想要家族生意的毛皮商人那里编织新的家庭。</p><p>  Étienne Waddens was one of them. A well-​educated Protestant from Berne, Switzerland, he had been hired by the British to fight the French in North America. He arrived in Canada in 1757 at the age of nineteen, as the Seven Years’ War was raking across Europe, North America, and the Caribbean. Like many other soldiers, Étienne left the army but chose not to return to Switzerland, which was itself mired in war and religious unrest. Abandoning his past and his Protestant religion, Waddens stayed in Canada as a merchant and a Catholic. By 1761 he felt settled enough to marry a French woman named Marie-​Joseph Deguire. They bought property in Montreal and baptized three children in the Catholic Church.</p><p>埃蒂安·瓦登斯就是其中之一。一口井-​他从瑞士伯尔尼接受新教教育，曾被英国雇佣到北美与法国作战。1757年，当七年战争席卷欧洲、北美和加勒比海时，19岁的他来到了加拿大。和许多其他士兵一样，埃蒂安离开了军队，但选择不返回瑞士，瑞士本身也深陷战争和宗教动荡之中。瓦登斯放弃了自己的过去和新教信仰，以商人和天主教徒的身份留在加拿大。到1761年，他觉得自己已经安定下来，娶了一个名叫玛丽的法国女人-​约瑟夫·德圭尔。他们在蒙特利尔购买了房产，并在天主教堂给三个孩子施洗。</p><p> To support his family, Waddens turned to the fur trade. He convinced some Montreal merchants to help him outfit a small contingent of young French men who would travel into Indian Country to trade for furs. The merchants would provide a year’s worth of trade goods, supplies, and a canoe to take them into fur country. To repay that loan, the traders had to bring back enough furs to satisfy their sponsors. To protect that investment, Étienne Waddens paddled with them down the St. Lawrence River in 1766, intending to spend the winter around the Great Lakes.</p><p>为了养家糊口，沃登斯开始从事毛皮贸易。他说服了一些蒙特利尔商人帮他装备一支小分队的年轻法国男子，他们将前往印度国家进行毛皮贸易。商人们将提供一年的贸易商品、用品和一艘独木舟，将他们带到毛皮国家。为了偿还这笔贷款，交易员们必须带回足够的毛皮来满足赞助商的要求。为了保护这项投资，埃蒂安·瓦登斯于1766年与他们一起沿着圣劳伦斯河划过，打算在五大湖周围过冬。</p><p> That venture succeeded. By 1770 Waddens had enough money to form his own small partnership, one of many trading outfits that were stealing business away from the Hudson’s Bay Company. These smaller fur enterprises—​staffed by men willing to travel to the interior and bring trade goods, including guns, ammunition, and alcohol, to Indian settlements—​made useful allies for Native people. With advice from tribal leaders, fur traders built a series of inland entrepôts like Michilimackinac, Grand Portage, and Rainy Lake. This trade, run almost exclusively by Native hunters and French ​Canadians, rapidly spread north and west after the Treaty of Paris in 1763. As winter trading posts extended farther north, the traders competed directly with the Hudson’s Bay Company.</p><p>那次冒险成功了。到1770年，瓦登斯有足够的钱组建自己的小型合伙企业，这是众多从哈德逊湾公司窃取业务的贸易机构之一。这些较小的毛皮企业-​他们的工作人员愿意前往内地，将枪支、弹药和酒精等贸易商品带到印度定居点-​成为当地人有用的盟友。在部落领袖的建议下，皮草贸易商修建了一系列内陆转口港，如米奇利马基诺、大波蒂奇和雨湖。这种贸易几乎完全由当地猎人和法国人经营​1763年巴黎条约签订后，加拿大人迅速向北和向西传播。随着冬季交易站向北延伸，交易员们直接与哈德逊湾公司展开竞争。</p><p> Literate and practical, Waddens rose quickly in that sector of the trade. He had the advantages of being Swiss and not English, and speaking both French and English. In 1772 he received a license to trade at Grand Portage, the connecting point between far northern winter posts and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence transportation routes. At Grand Portage, the huge canoes built for St. Lawrence and Great Lakes travel, packed with goods from Montreal, were exchanged for lighter, smaller canoes that men paddled up Canadian rivers into Ojibwe and Cree country. Located on the northwestern shore of Lake Superior in what is now northern Minnesota, Grand Portage became Waddens’ home.</p><p>瓦登斯既有文化又务实，在该行业迅速崛起。他有瑞士人而不是英国人的优点，而且会说法语和英语。1772年，他获得了在大Portage进行贸易的许可证，大Portage是遥远的北方冬季驿站与五大湖和圣劳伦斯运输路线之间的连接点。在Grand Portage，为圣劳伦斯和五大湖旅行建造的巨大独木舟，装满了来自蒙特利尔的货物，被换成了更轻、更小的独木舟，人们划着独木舟沿着加拿大河流进入奥吉布韦和克里国。Grand Portage位于如今明尼苏达州北部的苏必利尔湖西北岸，成为沃登斯的家。</p><p>  Étienne Waddens became a  hivernant or winterer, one of thousands of European men who spent winters with Native people in forts and Indian villages. And during the short days and long nights of winter, Europeans and Native people had sex, sometimes brief or violent, sometimes loving and sustained. Sex often evolved into settled relationships. European men expressed surprise at how quickly the “bewitchen vixens” became their “country” or “fort” wives. Large settlements of Cree and Assiniboine families gathered around Grand Portage every summer. Every fall they took traders like Étienne Waddens with them back to hunting camps. Étienne began a long and stable relationship with a Cree woman whose name we don’t know.</p><p>埃蒂安·瓦登斯成为了一名过冬者，他是数千名与当地人一起在堡垒和印度村庄过冬的欧洲人之一。在冬天的短白天和长夜里，欧洲人和当地人发生了性行为，有时短暂或暴力，有时充满爱和持久。性往往演变成稳定的关系。欧洲男性对“妖精妖女”很快成为他们的“国家”或“堡垒”妻子表示惊讶。每年夏天，克里和阿西尼博因家族的大型聚居地都聚集在格兰德波蒂奇周围。每年秋天，他们都会把埃蒂安·瓦登斯这样的商人带回狩猎营地。Étienne与一位我们不知道名字的克里族女性开始了长期稳定的关系。</p><p> A “country wife” offered a trader like Étienne Waddens comfort and economic advantage. If Waddens wanted a band to hunt for him and trade at his post, he had to create a formal family relationship. Like many others in the fur trade, he remained married to his Montreal wife, but he also joined a Cree family. To do so he must have approached the Cree woman’s father and brothers in proper ways, bringing gifts and only then suggesting marriage. He had to meet Cree standards about how husbands should behave and how they should provide for their Cree families. If he failed to recognize his obligations to an entire band, he wouldn’t get many furs, and his new wife would leave him.</p><p>一位“乡村妻子”为埃蒂安·瓦登这样的商人提供了舒适和经济优势。如果瓦登斯想要一支乐队来寻找他，并在他的岗位上进行交易，他必须建立一种正式的家庭关系。和皮草行业的许多其他人一样，他仍然与蒙特利尔的妻子结婚，但他也加入了克里家族。要做到这一点，他必须以适当的方式接近克里族妇女的父亲和兄弟，带来礼物，然后才建议结婚。他必须满足克里族关于丈夫行为举止以及如何供养克里族家庭的标准。如果他没有意识到自己对整个乐队的义务，他就不会得到很多皮草，他的新妻子也会离开他。</p><p> Often called  mariage à la façon du pays, or the custom of the country, these unions mixed Indian, French, and British customs. Native people, fur trade companies, and the Canadian government recognized them as legitimate marriages. The Catholic Church also sanctioned such unions, insisting that priests marry people even long after such relationships began.</p><p>这些工会通常被称为“mariageála façon du pays”，或该国的习俗，它们融合了印度、法国和英国的习俗。当地人、皮草贸易公司和加拿大政府都承认他们是合法婚姻。天主教会也批准了这种结合，坚持认为即使在这种关系开始很久之后，牧师也要与人结婚。</p><p> Though common, such unions involved risks, especially for women. Even European men whose families had lived in North America for generations lacked the survival skills that defined men in these indigenous societies. Their behavior was unpredictable. Some women were curious enough and attracted enough by the young Europeans to act on their own, but others felt pressure from their families or clans to do so. Either way, it took bravery to be guide and teacher, let alone lover or wife, to a stranger.</p><p>尽管这种结合很常见，但也存在风险，尤其是对女性而言。即使是家庭世代居住在北美的欧洲男性，也缺乏在这些土著社会中定义男性的生存技能。他们的行为难以预测。一些女性足够好奇，被年轻的欧洲人吸引，可以独立行动，但其他女性则感受到来自家庭或宗族的压力。不管怎样，当一个陌生人的向导和老师都需要勇气，更不用说情人或妻子了。</p><p> To ensure that such relationships served Cree or Algonquian needs, the women taught the  hivernants how to speak their languages. They taught them how to hunt and trap animals, manage deep snow, and survive on the ice. Sex and relationships kept the  hivernants in winter camps, but families made them loyal. With sex, whether within or without marriage, came children. The children of these unions helped secure a future for the tribe. A mixed-​descent child would become a permanent link to the White trading world but also a member of an indigenous clan with resources and power.</p><p>为了确保这种关系满足克里族或阿尔冈琴族的需要，这些女性教海文族如何说自己的语言。他们教他们如何捕猎和捕捉动物，管理厚厚的积雪，以及在冰上生存。性和人际关系使海文纳特人留在冬令营，但家庭使他们忠诚。无论是婚内还是婚外，伴随着性而来的是孩子。这些工会的子女帮助确保了部落的未来。混血儿-​世系儿童将成为与白人贸易世界的永久联系，但同时也是拥有资源和权力的土著部落的成员。</p><p> For Native people, marriage demanded broad reciprocal arrangements that Waddens might not have understood. Husbands and wives provided for and cared about each other, but their marriage was one among many relationships that supported their lives. Marriages didn’t have to be lifelong, and people commonly had relationships that were same-​sex or polygamous. Women knew that if they kicked out an abusive or lazy partner or if he left, their larger kin networks would support them and provide for their children. Extended families encouraged angry wives and husbands to forgive each other for various transgressions. If they couldn’t, unhappy people could try out other partners temporarily or separate permanently.</p><p>对于原住民来说，婚姻需要广泛的互惠安排，而沃登斯可能并不理解。丈夫和妻子互相照顾和照顾，但他们的婚姻是支撑他们生活的众多关系之一。婚姻不必是终身的，人们通常有着相同的关系-​性或一夫多妻制。女性知道，如果她们赶走了一个虐待或懒惰的伴侣，或者他离开了，她们更大的亲属网络会支持她们，并抚养她们的孩子。大家庭鼓励愤怒的妻子和丈夫原谅彼此的各种违法行为。如果不能，不快乐的人可以暂时尝试其他伴侣，或者永久分开。</p><p> Étienne Waddens passed the test. His new wife, who spoke Cree, French, and other Indian languages, helped him to negotiate trade and daily life. As he learned Cree, he could convince his new relatives to hunt for him, expanding his business. His Cree family got better access to trade goods because of their relationship with Waddens, and they spread those goods throughout a network of villages. No marriage would be stable or fully recognized until the birth of a child. Marguerite Waddens, born in 1775, bound Étienne to his Cree family.</p><p>埃蒂安·瓦登斯通过了测试。他的新妻子会说克里语、法语和其他印度语言，她帮助他谈判贸易和日常生活。当他了解克里时，他可以说服他的新亲戚去寻找他，扩大他的生意。由于与瓦登斯的关系，他的克里家族获得了更好的贸易商品渠道，并将这些商品传播到了整个村庄网络中。在孩子出生之前，任何婚姻都不会稳定或得到充分承认。玛格丽特·瓦登斯出生于1775年，与埃蒂安的克里家族结下了不解之缘。</p><p> Marguerite was born at Grand Portage, where the Rainy River links the Canadian forests to the Great Lakes. This spot, on the booming western frontier of the fur trade, drew indigenous people and others from many regions. The Cree, watching the fierce competition between fur-trade companies, operated as crucial middlemen. Spreading south from Hudson’s Bay as the fur trade expanded throughout the 1700s, they allied with the Assiniboine, the Ojibwe, and the French. Many Crees became skilled with horses and moved to the Canadian plains to hunt bison. Other Crees, like Marguerite’s family, remained farther north and east, hunting large fur-​bearing animals and small game in the Canadian forests. They made canoes, built fish weirs, and tapped maple trees. At the end of the eighteenth century, by connecting their lives to Native and European traders and goods, the Cree expanded in numbers and power. By the mid-​1700s they controlled who hunted where, and their efforts meant higher payments for furs and lower prices for trade goods at Hudson’s Bay Company forts.</p><p>玛格丽特出生在大波蒂奇，多雨的河流把加拿大的森林和五大湖连接起来。这个位于皮毛贸易蓬勃发展的西部边境的地方吸引了许多地区的土著人和其他人。克里人看着皮草贸易公司之间的激烈竞争，充当着至关重要的中间商。随着18世纪毛皮贸易的扩张，他们从哈德逊湾向南扩张，与阿西尼博因、奥吉布韦和法国人结盟。许多克里特人学会了骑马，并搬到加拿大平原去猎杀野牛。其他的部落，如玛格丽特的家族，则留在更远的北部和东部，猎取大型毛皮-​在加拿大的森林里饲养动物和小猎物。他们制造独木舟，建造鱼堰，砍伐枫树。十八世纪末，通过将他们的生活与本地和欧洲的商人和商品联系起来，克里族在数量和权力上都有所扩大。到了中午-​18世纪，他们控制了谁在哪里打猎，他们的努力意味着在哈德逊湾公司的堡垒里，毛皮的价格更高，贸易商品的价格更低。</p><p>  The business of fur was interrupted by waves of European war and North American imperial struggle but adapted. The Seven Years’ War, the longest and fiercest of the colonial wars fought between the French, the British, and dozens of Indian nations, overspread the region north, east, and west of the Ohio Valley. The region was claimed by New France but controlled by Shawnees, Wyandots, Delawares, Miamis, Illinois, Ojibwes, Sacs, and Foxes, who were drawn into the war on every side. When the war ended in 1763, after seasons of battle upset the fur trade along the St. Lawrence and at the Great Lakes, New France no longer existed in North America. Despite that formal change, thousands of French-​speaking people, both Native and European, still lived and worked in the fur trade. The British were now in charge, but this had little impact on how the trade worked. Beginning in 1767, the British who took over from French governors in Canada “permitted” traders to winter in villages north of Lake Superior. That policy was simply catching up with how operations actually worked in a business that took European men ever farther into Indian Country.</p><p>皮草业被欧洲战争和北美帝国斗争的浪潮打断，但得到了调整。七年战争是法国、英国和数十个印度国家之间进行的殖民战争中最长、最激烈的一次，它覆盖了俄亥俄河谷北部、东部和西部地区。该地区被新法国占领，但被肖尼人、怀安德多人、德拉瓦雷斯人、米亚斯人、伊利诺伊人、奥吉布韦斯人、萨克斯人和狐狸控制，他们都被卷入了战争。1763年战争结束时，在圣劳伦斯和五大湖一带的毛皮贸易因季节性的战争而受到破坏后，新法国在北美已不复存在。尽管有了这种形式上的改变，成千上万的法国人-​说英语的人，无论是本地人还是欧洲人，仍然在皮草贸易中生活和工作。英国人现在掌权，但这对贸易的运作几乎没有影响。从1767年开始，从加拿大的法国总督手中接手的英国人“允许”商人在苏必利尔湖以北的村庄过冬。这项政策只是在追赶一家将欧洲男性带入印度的企业的实际运作方式。</p><p> Marguerite’s early life demonstrated how far the fur trade had spread over North America. As forts opened between York Factory on Hudson’s Bay and the Great Lakes, she and her parents left Grand Portage to winter in forts far to the northwest. First they stayed near Cree villages in the Saskatchewan Valley, and finally at the southern edge of the Athabasca country, nearly in the Arctic. At 58 degrees north, average daily temperatures in January were –​6º Fahrenheit, and the sun peered anemically over the horizon only a few hours a day.</p><p>玛格丽特的早年生活证明了毛皮贸易在北美已经传播了多远。在哈德逊湾的约克工厂和五大湖之间的堡垒开张之际，她和父母离开了格兰德·波塔奇，前往西北部遥远的堡垒过冬。首先，他们住在萨斯喀彻温河谷的克里村庄附近，最后在阿萨巴斯卡国家的南部边缘，几乎在北极。在北纬58度，1月份的平均日气温为——​6华氏度，太阳一天只有几个小时在无风的地平线上凝视。</p><p> Marguerite learned how to smoke meat and fish, and how to make drinking water from snow over an ever-​burning fire, facing her mother’s wrath if she didn’t tend that fire properly. She knew how to skin animals and preserve fur, essential to surviving Canadian winters. Like most traders’ children, she spoke Indian languages, French, and English. Also like most mixed-​blood girls, she never learned to read or write, skills that would soon become necessary in a world of ledger books and letters.</p><p>玛格丽特学会了如何用烟熏肉和鱼，以及如何用雪在漫长的岁月里制造饮用水-​燃烧着的火，面对她母亲的愤怒，如果她不好好照顾那堆火。她知道如何给动物剥皮和保存皮毛，这对加拿大的冬季生存至关重要。和大多数商人的孩子一样，她会说印度语、法语和英语。也像大多数混血儿一样-​血女孩，她从来没有学会读或写，这些技能在一个充斥着账本和书信的世界里很快就会变得必不可少。</p><p> Cree families with daughters like Marguerite had some advantages in the eighteenth-​century fur trade because they had European men who were kin. Intermarriage could bridge chasms between clans, nations, and even fur companies. Like building bridges, however, mixing families also involved risk—​bringing strangers and germs into Native communities.</p><p>在十八世纪，有玛格丽特这样女儿的克里家族有一些优势-​世纪毛皮贸易，因为他们有欧洲男人的亲属。异族通婚可以弥合家族、国家甚至皮草公司之间的鸿沟。然而，就像建造桥梁一样，混居家庭也有风险-​把陌生人和细菌带到本地社区。</p><p>  Excerpted from  Born of Lakes and Plains: Mixed-Descent Peoples and the Making of the American West .
