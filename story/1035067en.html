From his home studio/ham shack in suburban Chicago, Hap produces his 12 to 17 minute weekly amateur radio program service, featuring timely interviews, thought-provoking commentaries from other hams, excerpts from Dayton Hamvention Forums and other items ofgeneral interest to the amateur community at large. Ham radio istraditionally an aural - as opposed to a visual - medium; we meet and recognize fellow hams primarily by voice, seldom seeing them in person. RAIN programming is also an aural medium, distributed to hundreds of repeaters across the country via the RAIN dial-up line, commercial satellite,(discontinued) Hap&#39;s subscription service on audio tape and on WA0RCR&#39;s weekly 160 meter informational broadcasts. Those repeater groups and others then replay the weekly RAIN tapes over their local repeater systems on their regular &#34;net night&#34; gatherings, permitting thousands of hams to hear Hap&#39;s offerings for that particular week. It&#39;s all done with volunteer help and - in the best of amateur traditions - without profit to anyone involved. Hap Holly makes it happen; he&#39;s an uncommonly intelligent and outgoing individual. Hap is also very aurally oriented and insists on quality in every way in his RAIN programming. He conducts most of the interviews, edits and engineers all of the program material, writes the scripts, duplicates and mails out the RAIN cassettes and archives and catalogs the RAIN library. It&#39;s all accomplished by touch and by ear...Hap is one of a number of non-sighted amateurs within our ranks, but you&#39;d never know it. For Hap, blindness happened literally overnight...when he was only 7. Problems with his vision began when he was 4, but then he awoke one morning totally blind. The condition is untreatable, at least within current medical terms, but to Hap, it hasn&#39;t been a handicap. In fact, in talking to him over the years, most of his friends tend to forget his unusual challenges, because he does so much of what we all do, without mention of his visual impairment. Both of Hap&#39;s parents were blind, his father&#39;s resulting from a football accident in college and his mother&#39;s when she was around the age of 12. His father, nonetheless, was a successful building contractor and architect, formulating the plans he devised within his &#34;mind&#39;s eye&#34;, then describing the details precisely to his secretary, who constructed balsa wood models. Then only by touch, Hap&#39;s dad would go over the &#34;3-dimensional plans&#34;, incorporating additions or changes as needed. Hap&#39;s father was also a long time columnist for the Christian Science Monitor and was known world-wide for his &#34;Ask a Builder&#34; column, which he wrote from 1965 until his passing in 1984. He was a touch typist - as is Hap - and was able to generate his column by that method alone (before the days of computers, word processors and voice synthesizers). In 1988, a 420-page book was written about Hap&#39;s mother, depicting her struggle for independence from her New England industrialist father, her marriage to Hap&#39;s dad and the eventual challenges that two sightless parents encountered raising four sighted children - then Hap too became blind. That book, entitled &#34;What Love Sees&#34; and is being made into a made-for-TV movie this year, which will be shown on the CBS television network when completed.It will star Richard Thomas of the original &#34;Walton&#39;s&#34; series and Anna Beth Gish who played Pat Nixon in the widely acclaimed motion picture &#34;Nixon&#34; which also starred Anthony Hopkins. The TV movie, which is also entitled &#34;What Love Sees&#34;, primarily takes place in the small southern California ranching town of Ramona (where much of it will be filmed) and reportedly will follow the Holly household up until shortly after the time that Hap&#39;s sight was lost, and the family was forced to move to a larger city - Escondido - to seek specialized educational opportunities for their youngest son. Be sure to watch for it this fall on television.( The movie aired in Sept., 1996 and again in June, 1999 on CBS; Lifetime aired it in Sept., 1999.) Hap&#39;s ham career began when he earned his Novice ticket in 1965, at the age of 14, receiving the call sign WN6UJH, while living in Escondido. He became a General - dropping the &#34;N&#34; in his call - a year later in 1966 and served as a phone-patch station and net control for the Westcars traffic net until 1970. Hap then headed off to Principia College in Elsah, Illinois and from 1970 to graduation in 1974, ran phone patches and kept radio schedules for his fellow students. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology, and soon found himself in the Chicago area, where he sought out world-class jazz accordionist Leon Sash, to pursue his other love, music. A year later, another love, Stephanie, became the center of Hap&#39;s attention and the two were married in August of 1976 after meeting the previous summer at the Roundup Ranch in Buena Vista, Colorado, where Hap was a counselor. Hap taught a class in non-visual perception to the high school campers at the ranch, all of whom were sighted, but who learned to &#34;see&#34; in yet another way ...with Hap&#39;s patient guidance. Hap&#39;s wife, Stephanie - who is also sighted - received her ham ticket in 1986 and the call KA9WKD, after realizing how much ham radio, and the good it was able to accomplish, meant to Hap. In 1977, Hap picked up the &#34;9-land&#34; call of WD9GJQ and he and Stephanie moved into their comfortable home in Des Plaines, Illinois where he resumed his phone-patching and DXing activities with his now permanent antenna and station set-up. In 1981, Hap passed his Advanced class license exam and changed calls once more, this time to his current KC9RP call sign. Hap served as ham radio informational programming guru for the BEAR, the Broadcast Employees Amateur Repeater in suburban Chicago, from 1984 to 1989. Hap&#39;s weekly &#34;net nights&#34; became something of a legend in the Chicago area, sometimes attracting in excess of 100 check-ins, via simulcasts on five area repeaters. This stint led to Hap&#39;s forming RAIN - the Radio Amateur Information Network - and the weekly RAINReport dial-up, and the bi-monthly RAIN Journal tape (produced especially for the blind amateur). According to Hap, &#34;My inspiration for producing weekly ham radio programming resulted from my &#39;need to know&#39; . I faithfully listened to the weekly Newsline (formerly WestLink Radio) reports in the early 1980&#39;s on my local repeater. I owe a great deal of gratitude to Newsline&#39;s founder and producer, Bill Pasternak, WA6ITF for his encouragement and direction. RAIN is truly an offspring of Newsline. In recent years, Hap has written for Spec-Com Journal, Radio Scan Magazine and occasionally reports for Newsline but with a human interest focus, as opposed to a news-only approach As mentioned before, Hap&#39;s RAIN programming can now be heard on hundreds of ham repeaters across the nation,by telephone, (847) 827-RAIN. (and here on  www.rainreport.com)Vern Jackson, WA0RCR continues to carry the RAIN Report on his 160 meter Gateway Radio News letter AM bulletin service from Wentzville, Missouri on 1.860Mhz, Saturday afternoon/evening. Hap is a common sight at the yearly Dayton Hamvention, taping a number of the forums with the help and cooperation of the Hamvention organizers. these forums are then incorporated throughout the year in Hap&#39;s RAINReports,making Dayton come alive for those of us who may not be able to attend personally. Hap is active on HF, VHF and The Internet, using both a Pc equipted with the JAWS speech screen reader program. He will be retiring his Versa-Braille II Plus terminal, which allows an accomplished Braille reader like Hap to access his Internet E-Mail with nearly the speed of a sighted user. He hopes to be mastering all RAIN audio digitally by summer. As a professional keyboardist, Hap&#39;s diverse repertoire of American music from the past 60 years has made him a popular choice in the Chicago area.Since 1975 Hap has been an active and honored member of theDes Plaines Lions Club and received the prestigious international Melvin Jones Fellowship plaque for his service to humanity. As a member of the Des Plaines Toastmasters since 1976, Hap has served as its president a number of times, and has twice served as an area governor. He and Stephanie are currently active with Des Plaines EMA. For Hap Holly, blindness has never been a disability, only a challenge that has served to &#34;fine-tune&#34; his other senses. If you have a friend or relative with a serious handicap or disability, and you&#39;ve felt that amateur radio would be a worthwhile hobby for them to pursue, perhaps Hap&#39;s extra-ordinary story might be just the inspiration they would need to take the plunge. Hap would disagree with my choice of terms (extra-ordinary) since he considers his accomplishments no more than the expected effort required to achieve anything worthwhile...but then that&#39;s the sign of extra-ordinary people isn&#39;t it?

Network的主持人。在他位于芝加哥郊区的家庭演播室/火腿棚屋里，哈普制作了他每周12到17分钟的业余广播节目，内容包括及时的采访，其他火腿的发人深省的评论，代顿哈姆发明论坛的节选，以及其他业余社区普遍感兴趣的项目。火腿电台传统上是一种听觉媒介，而不是视觉媒介；我们主要通过声音来认识和辨认火腿同伴，很少见到他们本人。RAIN节目也是一种听觉媒体，通过RAIN拨号线路、商业卫星、(已停产的)Hap的录音带订阅服务和WA0RCR‘s每周160米的信息广播，分发给全国数百个转播者。然后，这些转播组和其他人会在他们定期的网夜聚会上，通过当地的转播系统重放每周一次的雨录影带，让成千上万的火腿能够听到Hap在那一周的节目。这一切都是在志愿者的帮助下完成的--这是最好的业余传统--对参与其中的任何人都没有好处。HAP Holly做到了这一点；他是一个不同寻常的聪明和外向的人。HAP也非常注重听觉，在他的RAIN节目中坚持每一个方面的质量。他主持了大部分采访，编辑和设计了所有节目材料，撰写剧本，复制和邮寄雨带和档案，并为雨图书馆编目。这一切都是靠触觉和听觉来完成的……哈普是我们队伍中众多失明的业余爱好者之一，但你永远不会知道这一点。对于哈普来说，失明是在一夜之间发生的……当时他只有7岁。他的视力问题在他4岁的时候就开始出现了，但后来有一天早上他醒来时完全失明了。这种情况是无法治愈的，至少在目前的医疗条件下是这样，但对哈普来说，它并不是一个障碍。事实上，在多年来与他交谈时，他的大多数朋友往往会忘记他不同寻常的挑战，因为他做了很多我们都做过的事情，却没有提到他的视力障碍。哈普的父母都是盲人，他的父亲是在大学里的一次橄榄球事故中失明的，母亲在她12岁左右的时候是他的父亲。尽管如此，他的父亲仍然是一位成功的建筑承包商和建筑师，他在头脑中制定了自己设计的计划，然后向他的秘书准确地描述了细节，秘书制作了巴尔萨木质模型。然后，只有通过触摸，哈普的父亲才会审阅三维平面图，根据需要添加或更改内容。哈普的父亲也是《基督教科学箴言报》(Christian Science Monitor)的长期专栏作家，他从1965年写到1984年去世的专栏《问问建筑商》(Ask A Builder)闻名于世。他是一名触摸式打字员--哈普也是--仅靠这种方法就能写出自己的专栏(在电脑、文字处理器和语音合成器出现之前)。1988年，哈普的母亲写了一本420页的书，书中描述了她从新英格兰实业家父亲那里争取独立的斗争，她与哈普父亲的婚姻，以及两位失明的父母在抚养四个视力正常的孩子时遇到的最终挑战--后来哈普也失明了。这本名为《爱看什么》的书今年将被改编成电视电影，完成后将在CBS电视网上映。该书将由沃尔顿原著系列中的理查德·托马斯和安东尼·霍普金斯主演的安娜·贝丝·吉什主演，后者在广受好评的电影中饰演帕特·尼克松。这部名为《爱情所见》的电视电影主要发生在加利福尼亚州南部的一个牧场小镇雷蒙纳(大部分影片将在那里拍摄)，据报道，这部电影将一直跟踪霍莉一家，直到哈普失明后不久，霍莉一家被迫搬到一个更大的城市埃斯孔迪多，为他们最小的儿子寻找接受专门教育的机会。今年秋天一定要在电视上观看。(这部电影于1996年9月播出，1999年6月在CBS再次播出；Lifetime于1999年9月播出。)。哈普的火腿生涯始于1965年，当时他14岁，住在埃斯孔迪多，获得了代号WN6UJH的新手门票。一年后的1966年，他成为了一名将军--在他的电话中去掉了这个名字--并在1970年之前一直担任WestCars交通网的电话接线站和网络控制员。HAP随后前往伊利诺伊州埃尔萨市的普林西亚学院，从1970年到1974年毕业，为他的同学们打电话补丁，并保持无线电时间表。他毕业时获得了社会学学士学位，很快就来到了芝加哥地区，在那里他找到了世界级的爵士乐手风琴演奏家利昂·萨什(Leon Sash)。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank"
