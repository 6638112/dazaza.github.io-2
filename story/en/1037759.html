But Richard Williams, their father, was always convinced that Serena — 15 months younger than Venus, and the youngest of Oracene Price’s five daughters —  would go on to have the better career.</p><p>维纳斯·威廉姆斯是威廉姆斯姐妹中第一个在职业网球界大放异彩的人。但是他们的父亲理查德·威廉姆斯（Richard Williams）始终坚信，比维纳斯（Venus）年龄小15个月，也是奥拉辛·普莱斯（Oracene Price）五个女儿中最小的一个的塞雷纳（Serena）将会继续拥有更好的职业。</p><p> Richard Williams was right. While Venus has enjoyed a  magnificent career, winning seven Grand Slam singles titles, Serena has won  23 Grand Slams and is widely acclaimed as the best female tennis player (maybe the  best tennis player of any gender) of all time. What was true of the Williams sisters — that the younger one went on to be the better athlete — is also true across sports generally. This is the “little sibling effect,” one of the most intriguing findings in sports science: Younger siblings have a significantly higher chance of becoming elite athletes, as University of Utah professor Mark Williams and I explore in our new book, “ The Best: How Elite Athletes Are Made.”</p><p> 理查德·威廉姆斯是对的。尽管维纳斯的职业生涯辉煌，赢得了7个大满贯单打冠军，但塞雷纳却赢得了23个大满贯，并被公认为有史以来最好的女网球运动员（也许是所有性别中最好的网球运动员）。威廉姆斯姐妹的真实情况-年轻的后来成为更好的运动员-在所有体育项目中也是如此。这是“小兄弟效应”，是体育科学中最引人入胜的发现之一：正如犹他大学教授马克·威廉姆斯和我在新书中探讨的那样，年轻的兄弟姐妹成为精英运动员的机会要高得多。优秀运动员的生产方式。”</p><p> The effect was demonstrated in a comprehensive analysis of 33 sports in Canada and Australia. The study compared elite athletes — who had reached senior international competition — with near-elite athletes, who had reached the junior international or senior domestic level. One finding: “Elite athletes were more likely to be later-born children.”</p><p> 对加拿大和澳大利亚的33种运动进行了综合分析，证明了这一效果。该研究将达到国际高级比赛水平的精英运动员与达到国际或国内初级水平的近精英运动员进行了比较。一个发现：“精英运动员更有可能是后来出生的孩子。”</p><p>  On average, the two groups had the same number of total siblings. What mattered was whether those siblings were younger or older. The elite athletes had 1.04 older siblings on average; nonelite athletes had only 0.61.</p><p>  平均而言，两组的兄弟姐妹总数相同。重要的是那些兄弟姐妹是年轻还是年长。精英运动员的兄弟姐妹平均年龄为1.04；非精英运动员只有0.61。</p><p> Younger siblings’ advantage appears among both male and female athletes, according to that study, and other research found additional evidence of it in women’s sports. A 2014  study of the athletes vying for a spot on the U.S. women’s national soccer team, covering players involved in national team training camps, found that around three-quarters of players had an older sibling; only 20 percent were the oldest child, and just 5 percent were only children. National stars Megan Rapinoe, Mia Hamm and Alex Morgan were among those who played soccer with their older siblings as children.</p><p> 这项研究表明，年轻的兄弟姐妹的优势在男性和女性运动员中均表现出来，其他研究发现，在女性体育运动中也有更多的证据。 2014年，一项针对美国女子国家足球队争夺一席之地的运动员的研究覆盖了参与国家队训练营的球员，结果发现大约四分之三的球员中的兄弟姐妹年龄较大。年龄最大的孩子只有20％，只有孩子的只有5％。曾与年幼的兄弟姐妹踢足球的人包括国家巨星梅根·拉皮诺（Megan Rapinoe），米娅·哈姆（Mia Hamm）和亚历克斯·摩根（Alex Morgan）。</p><p> Even when two siblings both reach professional status, the younger one tends to be more successful. A 2010 study by Frank Sulloway and Richard Zweigenhaft of 700 pairs of brothers who played Major League Baseball found that younger brothers were 2.5 times as likely as their older brothers to record superior career batting statistics. Overall, among hitters and pitchers, younger brothers played an average of 2.5 years longer than older brothers and in a total of 226 more games.</p><p> 即使两个兄弟姐妹都达到了职业地位，年轻的兄弟姐妹也往往会更成功。 Frank Sulloway和Richard Zweigenhaft在2010年对700对参加美国职业棒球大联盟的兄弟进行的研究发现，记录职业击球统计数据的年轻兄弟是其哥哥的2.5倍。总体而言，在击球手和投手中，弟弟的平均踢球时间比哥哥长2.5年，总共多打了226场比赛。</p><p> The roots of the little sibling effect may lie in the way younger siblings strive to match their older siblings on the field. This was the case with Michael Jordan, the  youngest of the three Jordan boys and the fourth of the five Jordan children. When the siblings were growing up, Larry — who was born 11 months before Michael — was considered a better basketball player and regularly bested Michael in one-on-one games.</p><p> 兄弟姐妹效应的根源可能在于年轻的兄弟姐妹努力在场上与年长的兄弟姐妹匹配。迈克尔·乔丹就是这种情况，他是三个约旦男孩中最小的一个，五个约旦孩子中的第四个。当兄弟姐妹长大时，拉里（他比迈克尔早11个月出生）被认为是更好的篮球运动员，并经常在一对一比赛中击败迈克尔。 </p><p> “I don’t think, from a competitive standpoint, I would be here without the confrontations with my brother,” Michael recalled in the ESPN documentary “ The Last Dance.” “When you come to blows with someone you absolutely love, that’s igniting every fire within you. And I always felt like I was fighting Larry for my father’s attention. …</p><p>迈克尔在ESPN纪录片“最后的舞蹈”中回忆道：“从竞争的角度来看，我不会在没有哥哥冲突的情况下来到这里。” “当您与绝对挚爱的人一起吹奏时，那将点燃您内心的每一处火焰。而且我总是觉得自己正在和父亲拉里（Larry）争吵。 …</p><p> “I want that approval. I want that type of confidence. So my determination got even greater to be as good, if not better than, my brother.”</p><p> “我希望得到批准。我想要那种信心。因此，我的决心变得更大，即使不比我的兄弟也好。”</p><p>  Similar dynamics were at work in the Murray tennis family of Scotland. Elder brother Jamie became a  leading doubles player; younger brother Andy has won  three Grand Slam singles titles. “I think having an older sibling probably helped Andy to become extra competitive,” said his mother, Judy Murray, in “The Best.” “What helped Andy in particular become that sort of uber-competitor was having an older brother who’s a bit bigger and a bit stronger than him through most of his formative years. And all he ever wanted to do was to beat Jamie.”</p><p>  苏格兰的穆雷网球大家庭也正在发挥类似的作用。哥哥杰米（Jamie）成为领先的双打选手；弟弟安迪（Andy）赢得了三项大满贯单打冠军。他的母亲朱迪·默里（Judy Murray）在“最佳影片”中说：“我认为长大的兄弟姐妹可能有助于安迪提高竞争力。” “特别是让安迪成为超级竞争者的原因是，他的哥哥在成长的大部分时间里都比他大一点，也更强一点。他想做的就是击败杰米。”</p><p> As well as honing psychological skills, playing with an older sibling can also accelerate the development of physical skills. The theory is that athletes learn more when they are challenged and fail; the difficulties of these situations can provide feedback that  enables athletes to adapt and develop their skills. While older siblings can generally rely on being bigger and stronger to win, younger siblings “playing up” to their older siblings’ level need to develop creativity, decision-making skills and tactical intelligence to keep up — ultimately benefiting them on the field even when they are no longer at a physical disadvantage. Whether consciously or not, older siblings can pass on instructions to their younger siblings. “The ideal strategy for a younger sibling is to try out the same sport in which an older sibling is already established, benefit from a possible teaching effect, and then see if one can do better than the older sibling in that same sport,” Sulloway said.</p><p> 除了磨练心理技能外，与年长的兄弟姐妹一起玩耍还可以加速身体技能的发展。从理论上讲，运动员在受到挑战和失败时会学到更多。这些情况下的困难可以提供反馈，使运动员能够适应和发展自己的技能。虽然年长的兄弟姐妹通常可以依靠变得更大和更强壮来取胜，但年幼的兄弟姐妹要“发挥”至年长的兄弟姐妹的水平，需要发展创造力，决策能力和战术智慧以跟上步伐，即使在他们不再处于身体上的不利地位。无论是否有意识地，年长的兄弟姐妹都可以将指令传递给年幼的兄弟姐妹。 “对于年轻的兄弟姐妹来说，理想的策略是尝试一项已经建立了较老的兄弟姐妹的运动，并从可能的教学效果中受益，然后看一看在同一项运动中是否可以比较老的兄弟姐妹做得更好，” Sulloway说过。</p><p> The amount of informal play that athletes do may also be a predictor of who goes on to become elite. A study comparing soccer players who were offered scholarships from Premier League academies at age 16 with players who were released found that the two groups had accumulated a nearly identical number of hours in practice at their academies.⁠ But players offered scholarships had spent more than twice as much time per year on informal soccer play — games with family and friends in local streets and parks — than the players who were released.  The NBA has also noted that informal play exposes children to more variables — like different roles and positions, court sizes and numbers of players — which can accelerate skill development, creating “smarter learners” used to adapting.</p><p> 运动员所进行的非正式比赛的数量也可能是预测谁将继续成为精英的原因。一项将16岁时获得英超联赛奖学金的足球运动员与被释放的球员进行比较的研究发现，这两组足球运动员在其学校的实践时间几乎相同.⁠但是，提供奖学金的球员花费了两倍以上与被释放的球员相比，每年在非正式足球比赛（与家人和朋友在当地街道和公园进行的比赛）上花费的时间更长。 NBA还指出，非正式比赛使孩子们面临更多的可变因素，例如不同的角色和职位，球场大小和球员人数，这可以加速技能发展，创造出习惯于适应的“更聪明的学习者”。</p><p> These findings further help explain the little-sibling effect. Younger siblings are generally able to get more informal play at a younger age than those without older siblings, as they can play with their elder brothers and sisters. Firstborns and only children have to wait for their parents to play with them, or for their parents to arrange play dates; those with elder siblings do not.</p><p> 这些发现进一步帮助解释了兄弟姐妹效应。与没有年长兄弟姐妹的兄弟姐妹相比，年幼兄弟姐妹通常能够在年轻时获得更多的非正式游戏，因为他们可以与哥哥和姐姐一起玩。长子和独生子女必须等待父母陪伴他们玩耍，或等待父母安排玩耍的日期；那些有长辈的兄弟姐妹没有。</p><p> Parents also give younger siblings a better chance of becoming elite athletes by treating them differently. Parents are notoriously more indulgent of later-born children, letting them go out more at a younger age — including engaging in unsupervised informal play. Compared with older siblings, younger siblings are around 40 percent more likely to be allowed to play dangerous contact sports, so they have more opportunity of making it to the top in these sports. A certain rebellious streak may also benefit younger siblings on the field: In Major League Baseball, younger brothers are 10.6 times more likely to attempt to steal a base and 3.2 times more likely to steal successfully, Sulloway and Zweigenhaft found. Later-born MLB players are also more likely to get hit by a pitch than than their older brothers, suggesting that they’re less likely to be intimidated and less willing to back down from a confrontation — perhaps because those younger brothers were hit by more pitches growing up playing with their elder brothers.</p><p> 父母还通过对他们的不同对待，使年幼的兄弟姐妹有更多机会成为精英运动员。众所周知，父母更喜欢后代的孩子，让他们更年轻地外出，包括参加无人看管的非正式游戏。与年长的兄弟姐妹相比，年幼的兄弟姐妹被允许参加危险的接触运动的可能性提高了约40％，因此他们有更多的机会在这些运动中脱颖而出。 Sulloway和Zweigenhaft发现，某种叛逆性举动也可能使年轻的兄弟姐妹受益：在美国职棒大联盟中，弟弟尝试偷垒的可能性高出10.6倍，成功偷窃的可能性高3.2倍。较之于较早的兄弟，较晚出生的MLB球员也更容易受到球场的打击，这表明他们受到威胁的可能性较小，也不太愿意从对抗中退缩-也许是因为这些弟弟受到了更多的打击。与他们的哥哥一起成长的球场。 </p><p>  By the time younger siblings follow older siblings into the talent pathway for a particular sport, parents are “more familiar with how to navigate the sporting system,” said Melissa Hopwood, the co-author of the study of Canadian and Australian athletes. “They knew the good clubs, the good coaches, the commitment required, so they had a more informed, deliberate experience rather than flying blind.”</p><p>研究加拿大和澳大利亚运动员的合著者梅利莎·霍普伍德（Melissa Hopwood）说，当年幼的兄弟姐妹跟随年长的兄弟姐妹进入一项特定运动的人才之路时，父母“已经对如何操纵运动系统更加熟悉”。 “他们知道好的俱乐部，好的教练，需要的承诺，因此他们拥有更丰富的知识，深思熟虑的经验，而不是盲目。”</p><p> Athletes can also learn from what worked — and what didn’t — for their older siblings. This has been the case with the remarkable  Ingebrigtsen family of runners. Three of the Norwegian brothers have won the gold medal in the 1,500-meter race at the European Championships. Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the youngest of the brothers, is the only one who has also won the gold medal in the European Championships’ 5,000-meters event; in 2018, at age 17, he won gold in both the 1,500- and 5,000-meter races.</p><p> 运动员还可以从对年长的兄弟姐妹有效的方法中汲取教训，而对无效的兄弟姐妹可以借鉴。杰出的Ingebrigtsen赛跑者家族就是这种情况。挪威兄弟中的三个在欧洲锦标赛的1,500米比赛中获得了金牌。雅各布·英格布里森（Jakob Ingebrigtsen）是最年轻的兄弟，他们也是唯一在欧洲锦标赛5000米赛事中获得金牌的人。在2018年，他17岁那年在1,500米和5,000米比赛中均获得金牌。</p><p> “Both Filip and him have learned from my mistakes,” said older brother Henrik after Jakob’s first gold medal in Berlin. “I have made a lot of mistakes!</p><p> “菲利普和他都从我的错误中学到了东西，”雅各布在柏林获得第一枚金牌后，哥哥亨里克说。 “我犯了很多错误！</p><p> “But every year, we try to optimize our program and all of [our] training and all of your workouts, and Jakob is starting his training with the perfect programs, more or less.” Now, Jakob is turning into another case study for how younger siblings tend to come out on top in sports.</p><p> “但是每年，我们都会尝试优化我们的计划以及所有[我们的]培训以及您所有的锻炼，而Jakob或多或少都以完美的计划开始了他的培训。”现在，雅各布正成为另一个案例研究，以研究年轻的兄弟姐妹如何在运动中脱颖而出。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/athletes/">#athletes</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/兄弟姐妹/">#兄弟姐妹</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
