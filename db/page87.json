I know I can just opt out of the change but I mean the minigame is useless without annotations\n  level 1  For someone who really isn\u2019t comprehending what this means. Can I get the dumbed down version plz.\n level 2  youtube is about to mercilessly kill all unattended unlisted videos despite the intention of the uploader for it to be accessible by link.\n  level 1  Is this even legit? I found this message in my spam quarantine. What kind of URL is this:  https://blog.youtube/ ! Came here to see if anyone else felt this was suspicious. Guess I&#39;m just getting paranoid ;-)\n  level 1  So, it seems you could just change it back to unlisted again after they change it to private, if you wanted to. Apparently, that would cause you to have the mysterious security problem again (whatever that is). But if that&#39;s the case, what would happen if you changed a currently private (or public) old video to unlisted... would it now have this mysterious security problem? Or would you have to re-upload them again also to avoid the mysterious problem? They don&#39;t say.\n level 2  I&#39;m guessing any old links won&#39;t work, so when you re-change it to unlisted you&#39;ll get a new link you&#39;ll need people to use in order to view the video.\n  level 1  I have a lot of old videos in my favorites playlist dating back &gt;10 years that have become unlisted over time. A bit sad that they will soon become permanently inaccessible.\n level 2  I have an unlisted video playlist so I gotta download all of them soon. We have a month left\n level 2  same here, the only way to be sure a youtube video will exist is to have it on your computer \ud83d\ude25\n level 1  Just got this. What enhanced security am i missing out on if i opt out my older videos and keep them unlisted, rather than re-upload under the new system that generates unlisted links?\n level 2  Good question. I can&#39;t say that someone discovering an unlisted video was exactly a big security concern of mine... I mean it is a link that you probably shared somewhere or sent somewhere, or embedded in a website that anyone viewing the source can see, thus you know those links are going to get around eventually. I&#39;m not exactly expecting unlisted videos to be &#34;secure&#34;. If I really wanted security, I would share them privately (or not put them on YouTube at all).\n   level 1  Either I&#39;m stupid or their opt-out system was poorly conceptualized.

US authorities also had civil charges pending against McAfee for an estimated $13 million in profits from cryptocurrency schemes.\n McAfee was arrested in Spain in\u00a0 October 2020 and held in jail as a  \u201cflight risk\u201d pending his extradition hearing.\n In a social media post on June 16, 2021, which turned out to be\u00a0one of his last, he revealed that the millions in cryptocurrency have been  \u201cdissolved\u201d by his associates, who he said had abandoned him in fear.\n               Best known for\u00a0his eponymous\u00a0antivirus software, McAfee actually resigned from that company in 1994 and pursued other ventures, but took a massive hit to his fortune during the 2008 financial crisis. He lived in Belize for a period, but left in 2013 after being accused \u2013 falsely, he said \u2013 of having a neighbor killed.\n McAfee also made two bids for the US presidency, in 2016 and 2020.

Technica\u3002 ", "note_en": "Altice is slashing its cable-Internet upload speeds by up to 86 percent starting on July 12. Altice Optimum Online plans that currently have advertised upload speeds of 35Mbps will be reduced to uploads of either 5Mbps, 10Mbps, or 20Mbps, depending on the plan. Altice did not announce any immediate price changes on the plans that are getting upload-speed cuts.\n The only good news for users is that the change will not affect existing customers as long as they stay on their current service plans, an Altice spokesperson told Ars. But new customers will have to accept the lower upload speeds, and existing customers would have to take the lower upload speeds whenever they upgrade, downgrade, or change service, Altice said.\n Altice claimed that its cable network isn&#39;t having any trouble offering its current advertised speeds. &#34;Our network continues to perform very well despite the significant data usage increases during the pandemic and the speed tiers we offer,&#34; the company said. The upload-speed change is apparently being implemented not to solve any network problem but to match the slower upload speeds offered by other cable ISPs. Altice told Ars that it is changing its cable upload speeds to bring them &#34;in line with other ISPs and aligned with the industry.&#34;\n Altice&#39;s 100Mbps download plan currently comes with 35Mbps uploads. But those uploads will be dropped to 5Mbps, an 86 percent cut. The 200Mbps plan with 35Mbps uploads today will get only 10Mbps uploads after the July 12 changeover date. The 300Mbps and 500Mbps-download plans that currently have 35Mbps uploads will be cut to 20Mbps on the upload side. Download speeds will remain the same.\n Additionally, Altice&#39;s\u00a0400Mbps-download plan is being cut from 40Mbps uploads to 20Mbps, while the gigabit-download plan&#39;s upload speeds are being cut from 50Mbps to 35Mbps. As a  Stop the Cap article on Monday noted, Altice  listed the upcoming changes in a chart on its website:\n    Altice notes that its fiber-to-the-home service provides symmetrical speeds, with uploads as high as downloads. When asked why it isn&#39;t raising cable-upload speeds instead of lowering them, Altice told Ars, &#34;Over the last few years, we have been investing in building a 100 percent fiber network. We are hyper-focused on our fiber expansion, which is currently available to over 1 million homes\u2014and growing quickly\u2014and offers symmetrical speeds up to 1Gbps.&#34;\n But &#34;a 100 percent fiber network&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that Altice will upgrade all or even most of its cable customers to fiber. It&#39;s &#34;100 percent fiber&#34; in the sense that customers who are in the fiber footprint won&#39;t be limited by old cable wires.\n Those 1 million homes with fiber are  reportedly just 20 percent of Altice&#39;s footprint, so most of its customers can&#39;t get symmetrical speeds. Altice  told investors that it will add 500,000 more homes to its fiber network this year. Including cable and fiber, Altice offers service in 21 states and had  4.4 million Internet customers at the end of Q1 2021.\n Altice purchased Suddenlink in 2015 and Cablevision in 2016, becoming the fourth-largest US cable operator after Comcast, Charter, and Cox. The upload-speed changes will be rolled out to all parts of Altice&#39;s network, as the company told Ars that it is &#34;aligning speed tiers across our footprint.&#34;\n  For years, the cable industry has been teasing future upgrades that would let cable networks deliver symmetrical download and upload speeds just as fiber networks do. But despite upgrades to DOCSIS, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification, major cable providers generally still do not provide upload speeds higher than 35Mbps.\n Altice cutting its cable upload speeds while building out symmetrical-speed fiber is another indication that fiber will maintain its superiority over cable networks for the foreseeable future. A year ago, Cox  lowered upload speeds in some entire neighborhoods due to congestion, and no cable network appears close to delivering an upload-speed breakthrough to customers.\n Comcast recently  touted a lab test in which it used DOCSIS 4.0 to deliver 4Gbps uploads and downloads over cable, but the company gave no indication of when it will raise its commercially available cable-upload speeds. Like Altice, Comcast only offers symmetrical speeds on its fiber network, which isn&#39;t as widespread as its cable footprint.\n Comcast and  Charter&#39;s advertised upload speeds on their cable networks still max out at  35Mbps, and customers have to buy the gigabit-download plan to get that 35Mbps upload rate. Comcast&#39;s slowest plan has only 3Mbps uploads, and Charter&#39;s slowest plan has 4Mbps uploads.\n Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 13 percent of Charter, is part of Advance Publications.

The Financial Times   reported the fund insisted its closure was unrelated to the rally, and a person close to the fund told the paper that it had earned back &#34;a fair share&#34; of the losses. Thanks to  a short squeeze orchestrated in part by Wall Street Bets and hordes of online retail investors, firms shorting Gamestop in anticipation of the stock\u2019s fall suffered collective  billions of dollars in losses as the price shot from $20 to nearly $500 early this year. Other big funds that suffered major losses on bets against GameStop include Melvin Capital, Light Street Capital, and short seller Citron.\n  White Square\u2019s chief investment officer Florian Kronawitter said that the firm\u2019s closure was unrelated. Kronawitter told investors in a letter that White Square\u2019s closure was more related to two large investors pulling out their funds as part of a larger \u201cshift in trend away from hedge fund investing to cheaper alternatives\u201d in addition to other changes in the investment landscape.\n  &#34;The decision to close down is related to thinking the equity long-short model is challenged,&#34; Kronawitter wrote in the letter, according to the Financial Times. &#34;There are way too many fish in the pond with the same strategy of long-short,&#34; he said. &#34;The traditional edge is being arbed away [eroded by other investors], there&#39;s an oversupply of capital.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:41:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u57fa\u91d1,fund", "title": "\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u77ed\u8def\u7684Gamestop\u5173\u95ed\u4e86 ", "title_en": "Hedge Fund That Shorted GameStop Shuts Down", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xzd8/hedge-fund-that-shorted-gamestop-shuts-down", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u57fa\u91d1", "fund"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "46088d4e7ee43aed6543062b5405c81b.jpg", "infoid": 1067809, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Sylvain Kalache\u662f\u200b\u200b\u57c3\u535a\u5c14\u987f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u57f9\u8bad10\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u624d\u3002\u4e00\u4f4d\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u884c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u3002\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u7528LinkedIn\u6536\u8d2d\u4e86LED\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e3aCIO\u548cVENTUREBEAT\u7f16\u5199\u4e86\u3002\n   \u867d\u7136\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4f1a\u8bae\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5b63\u5ea6\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u826f\u597d\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u8c08\u8bdd\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u5411\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u53d1\u9001\u6bcf\u6708\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\n \u66f4\u65b0\u66f4\u65b0\uff1a\u4e1a\u52a1\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8de8\u5ea6\u6b63\u5728\u7f29\u5c0f\u3002\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u6d88\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bfb\u53d6\u3002\n \u53ca\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff1a\u56db\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5f88\u957f\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6216\u5728\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u671f\u3002\u6bcf\u6708\u683c\u5f0f\u5141\u8bb8\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u65e9\u5148\u63a5\u6536\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u6216\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u5728\u5546\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff01\n \u4fdd\u7559\u5b83\u4eec\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\uff1a\u4f7f\u8463\u4e8b\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u65b0\uff0c\u5c06\u907f\u514d\u5728\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4f1a\u8bae\u671f\u95f4\u907f\u514d\u5197\u957f\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u6218\u7565\u8c08\u8bdd\u3002\n   \u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f81\u6c42\u5728ad-hoc\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a - \u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5e94\u8bb0\u4f4f\uff0c\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e2e\u52a9\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u51b3\u5b9a\u6216\u5e0c\u671b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u77e5\u60c5\u610f\u89c1\u7591\u95ee\uff0c\u8bf7\u5411\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u9898\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u5c24\u5176\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u4e94\u5206\u949f\u7535\u8bdd\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u6362\u8005\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u96be\u4e0e\u56e2\u961f\u8ba8\u8bba\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\u5e94\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7684\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\u5206\u4eab\u673a\u5bc6\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u900f\u89c6\u3002 \n\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5e94\u786e\u4fdd\u5b9a\u671f\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e1a\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u8d44\u91d1\u3002 \u7531\u4e8e\u884c\u4e1a\u666f\u89c2\u6216\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fdb\u5316\u6216\u7ade\u4e89\u52a0\u5f3a\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u671f\u671b\u3002 ", "note_en": "Sylvain Kalache is the co-founder of  Holberton, an edtech company training digital talent in more than 10 countries.

First published in 1843, the story recounts a heinous act \u2014 murdering a housemate and stuffing his body beneath the floorboards \u2014 and the narrator\u2019s attempt to rationalize it after the fact. While the crime takes up most of the story, the drama lies elsewhere: in the mind of the narrator, as he strains to make sense of the senseless thing he\u2019s done. Poe\u2019s style, all em dashes and italics, is the dark mirror of the agony it portrays: pulled apart by anxiety, the narrator\u2019s mind ultimately comes undone in the story\u2019s final line. Mistaking the hammer of his own heart for that of the dead man, he breaks down the wall between his inner monologue and the outside world: \u201c[T]ear up the planks! here, here! \u2014 it is the beating of his hideous heart!\u201d\n But what tale does the heart tell? On the surface, Poe\u2019s story is about the unbearable nature of guilt, his narrator a precursor to Raskolnikov cowering in his flat or Stephen Dedalus sweating in church. The thumping of the titular organ has become a shorthand for criminal conscience, for what happens when we can\u2019t let certain things slide. But beneath the crime and cover-up is an account of thinking in general, of how mind and matter flow into one another in ways we can\u2019t control. The murder plot, which seems to come from somewhere else (\u201cIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain\u201d), sharpens the narrator\u2019s senses and steadies his hand. But guilt is something physical, too: ringing in his ears, beating through his feet. Poe not only makes us  feel the tortured dissembling he describes, but he also seems to insist that thinking is feeling: minds are always battling to keep the passions in check lest they burst forth in catastrophic ways. The heart, in other words, tells a tale of the mind \u2014 and what happens when it is pushed to the limit.\n Embodied cognition, as dramatized in \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d is a way of accounting for such limits and the terror we feel when confronting them. Poe would know: his life story could be told in much the same way, a pendulum that swung erratically from ambition to addiction over his short 40 years. He poured his struggles onto the page \u2014 sometimes consciously, sometimes less so \u2014 and the result is a body of work that is still among the best known in American letters. What tortured him in the material world seems to have fed his imagination; he turned his confrontations with life\u2019s limits (including the horror of death) into a canon of literature that toed the line between madness and method. His own mind, like that of the narrator in \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d was always on the move, racing between ellipses and exclamation points as he tried to make sense of the world around him and pull it all together. That effort, a grand cosmology, was his final unfinished project, but the dark pieces Poe produced along the way may have proved that any grand project was doomed, if not to failure, then to feeling \u2014 ultimately \u2014 incomplete.\n  The horrors Poe conjured were in many ways his own. The macabre poems and short stories for which he is known are only a part of Poe\u2019s tale, though they are more familiar to readers today than the intellectual and cultural terrain across which he ranged widely (and darkly) in his short life. At turns a well-regarded author and a much-maligned editor, a critic so sharp he made more enemies than friends, Poe was one of the first Americans to make a living by letters alone. It wasn\u2019t much of a living, to be sure, stalked as he was by financial hardship that propelled him from one venture to another. But the circumstances that made Poe\u2019s life so hard to  live help explain why it still captivates us. He was an inventor \u2014 of genres, of moods \u2014 and insofar as necessity is the mother of invention, understanding Poe\u2019s struggles becomes crucial to understanding his written work.\n This is the central insight of  The Reason for the Darkness of the Night: Edgar Allan Poe and the Forging of American Science, a splendid new biography by the historian John Tresch. Poe\u2019s manic omnivory, his intellectual passions and professional struggles, is the heart of the book, helping Tresch show that what we now call science emerged alongside (and often through) practices we deem mystical, if not misguided. For Tresch, Poe\u2019s zigzagging trajectory from astronomy to the occult and back again is proof less of science\u2019s strange bedfellows and more of a tragic narrowing in what it means to be scientific. Poe\u2019s stories, on this view, do more than mirror the science and technology of his day. Literature and science were densely entangled, pursued in tandem by boundary-crossers like Poe and his followers. \u201cEven while exploring the outer limits of imagination and irrationality,\u201d Tresch writes, Poe \u201cwould continue to ask how a poet might love science and how deem it wise.\u201d Flights of fancy, or even folly, were not antithetical to science; they were often its driving force.\n Tresch is eager to restore Poe to his rightful place in this tangled history. The book \u201creturns Poe\u2019s cosmology to its place at the summit of his life and thought, showing his work as a singular expression of the tumultuous ideas and passions of his age, thoroughly bound up with the emergence of modern science.\u201d From childhood as an orphan to his death 40 years later, Poe\u2019s tragic life furnishes both a narrative arc and a who\u2019s-who of the literary and scientific establishment in the antebellum United States. Weaving private letters and published works into a broader history, Tresch uses Poe as a drunken Virgil, through whose hazy eyes we catch glimpses of abolitionism and the Mexican-American War, new technologies and the Second Great Awakening. The effect is dizzying \u2014 and part of the point. Presidential elections are on par with editorial spats, hoaxes sit side by side with discoveries. In Poe\u2019s mind (if not Tresch\u2019s), boundaries \u2014 between self and other, science and society, poetry and politics \u2014 tend to shimmer, even dissipate. It\u2019s not just that Poe was an outsider (though he was); even the insiders experienced the Jacksonian period as one of dissolution. But Poe seems to have felt the era\u2019s ups and downs more acutely than almost anyone.\n  Money issues weren\u2019t Poe\u2019s only plague. Mental health, and particularly addiction, troubled him from a young age. What we now call alcoholism (or, per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d) haunts the pages of Tresch\u2019s biography, appearing either to foil Poe\u2019s plans or to drown his sorrows when they failed for other reasons. The lexicon of addiction was different then, and descriptions by both Poe and his contemporaries are at once strange and familiar. His \u201chope of relieving a nervous attack\u201d reads like the kind of self-medication we still see so often, while later struggles with \u201cthe Fiend of Intemperance\u201d are signs of a Victorian vernacular. Drinking led to gambling, exacerbating financial stress and trapping Poe in a vicious cycle he broke only occasionally. \u201cI became insane,\u201d Poe wrote near the end, \u201cwith long intervals of horrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness I drank, God only knows how often or how much.\u201d If Poe\u2019s life and texts are the train tracks of his biography, then alcohol is its third rail, a power that was ever-present \u2014 and frequently devastating.\n Problems like Poe\u2019s were thought of less as dependence or disease than they are today, and more as a war against an external threat. The reason the temperance activist Carrie Nation smashed all those saloons later in the century was the terrifying power of alcohol itself; breaking bottles was supposed to release men from a spell. Intangible forces were being invoked everywhere: from anti-alcohol crusades and Christian revivalism to mesmeric performances and theories of luminiferous ether. The self, it seemed, was buffeted by hidden energies \u2014 some dark, some divine. Poe\u2019s personal struggles were reflected in much of his writing, in pieces that tested the limits of prosody and plot or tugged at the boundaries of literature and science. His own ordeals became those of his characters. Poe drank, wrote a friend, \u201c[t]o calm &amp; quiet the excessive nervous excitability under which he labored\u201d on \u201cThe Raven,\u201d \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d and lesser-known pieces like \u201cSonnet \u2014 To Science\u201d or (Tresch\u2019s favorite)  Eureka: An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe. Taken together, these form a cosmology, a poetics of limitation through which Poe strained the bounds of meter and materialism. The habits he hated in the real world haunted the worlds he imagined, too.\n It\u2019s hard not to read Poe in light of his all-too-human limits. Tresch does so occasionally, suggesting for example that Poe\u2019s raven might have been \u201cthe embodiment of guilt and shame, the return of the repressed, whether individual or national.\u201d His reading of \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d as a perverse \u201cscientific experiment\u201d that \u201cdramatized the dark side of the Enlightenment\u201d is a compelling one, though its central unraveling will be just as familiar to anyone who has struggled with the temptations that tormented Poe. After all, the genre Poe is famous for inventing \u2014 detective fiction \u2014 makes science seem like obsession, spinning method and meaning out of the smallest of clues. Characters from Sherlock Holmes (partly based on Poe\u2019s Auguste Dupin) to Dr. Gregory House fueled deduction with drug abuse, testing the limits of the brain and the liver at once. While Poe\u2019s Dupin is not (obviously) a victim of such habits, he \u201centers into the mind of his opponent\u201d via a method that troubles the limits of the self in related ways. In Poe\u2019s published work and private life, the self is less sovereign, less stable than it seems. Minds flicker, fracture, or fade out.\n  Tresch\u2019s title is a reference to limits of another sort. It stems from an astronomical puzzle on the minds of many in Poe\u2019s day: if space is infinite, as the Newtonians believed, then why is the night sky not completely illuminated with starlight? After all, in an infinite universe, each spot in the sky should be filled with a star more or less distant from the point of observation. In  Eureka, the last lecture Poe gave and the text with which Tresch begins and ends his biography, Poe proposed a solution: the universe has limits, both spatial and temporal. Poe\u2019s cosmology leaned on limitation as a necessary framework for life\u2019s meaning. Everything that exists, every atom and poem alike, was a consequence of this fundamental finitude; each embodied a balancing act of attraction and repulsion through which the larger drama of spiritual unity unfolded. If this strikes you as confusing \u2014 you are not alone. Tresch, a fan, describes  Eureka as \u201cpunishingly digressive and lopsided\u201d \u2014 much like the cosmology it described. Intentional or not, this affinity between style and substance was classic Poe: brilliant but alienating, revealingly of its moment and frustratingly ahead of its time.\n Eureka embodied its own argument, its style stretched thin in mirroring how an infinite soul expands into a finite universe. And Tresch\u2019s biography does something similar. It is a tall task to layer so many histories \u2014 political, cultural, literary, scientific \u2014 onto the life of a single individual, even one so idiosyncratic as Poe. At times, Tresch pushes past where Poe can lead. Alexander Dallas Bache, one of the forgers of American science, features heavily for someone Poe never met. The same goes for P. T. Barnum, a \u201cforger\u201d in quite another sense, though Poe did engage with him briefly in print. Tresch is reaching here, but for a reason: Bache and Barnum are poles at the ends of a spectrum, along which Poe raced back and forth. \u201cPoe\u2019s strategies,\u201d Tresch argues, \u201cwere at times those of Bache, at times those of Barnum. Pushed by poverty and the threat of starvation, he constantly shifted his positions; in his writings the pursuit of truth was accompanied by the play of glitter and shadow.\u201d Poe was pushed by necessity not just to invent but also to imitate, to take conventions \u2014 whether social or literary \u2014 and see how far he could run with them.\n After all, conventions are another kind of limit. It\u2019s no accident that Poe is remembered best for his contributions to some of our most codified genres: mystery and horror, detective stories and science fiction \u2014 to say nothing of scientific papers themselves, more hidebound than anything else. Those who live and breathe in the world of such genres \u2014 as authors or readers, fans or scholars \u2014 tend to see their limits as a form of freedom, a foundation for the wildest fantasy and speculation that guards against the full collapse of meaning. Biography does something similar: knowing roughly where we\u2019ll start and stop, authors can give us many worlds at once. Poe embodies this perfectly: we peel back the layers on one man\u2019s life, and we find everything from personal trauma to cosmological drama. Yes, Poe is a special subject. His mind expands outward, capturing a sense of the infinite in a finite space (like the utopian technologies and cosmograms Tresch analyzes elsewhere). But taking biography as a starting point rather than an end in itself, we find a lesson we share with Poe: that the only thing scarier than a sense of our limits is the fiction that we can somehow transcend them.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:23:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65f6\u95f4,sanity,warning", "title": "\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7406\u667a\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u57c3\u5fb7\u52a0\u00b7\u827e\u4f26Poe ", "title_en": "Horrible Sanity: An Edgar Allan Poe for Our Time", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/horrible-sanity-an-edgar-allan-poe-for-our-time/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u95f4", "sanity", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0d50ec486946000a5a307b1cd6c9803f.jpg", "infoid": 1067806, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u57fa\u7763\u5f92K.\u674e\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6Paquita Wiggins\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u975e\u6d32\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5408\u6cd5\u67aa\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\n          \u62c6\u9664\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u9ed1\u67aa\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u65e5\u5e38\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff1a\u57fa\u7763\u5f92K.

", "note_en": "How photographer Christian K. Lee and activist Paquita Wiggins are working to shift the narrative on legal gun ownership among African Americans\n          Dismantling the stereotypes connected to Black gun ownership in this country is the mission of two everyday citizens:\u00a0Christian K. Lee, a photojournalist based in Austin, Texas and Paquita Wiggins, an LGBTQ activist residing in our nation&#39;s capital. Both believe there is a misconception that lies at the heart of gun ownership in the Black community. Lee and Wiggins are working to change outdated notions they say deem being Black and armed as dangerous, threatening, and antithetical to what it means to be a law-abiding citizen in the United States.\n    Wiggins and Lee are just two out of the many who want to change misconceptions about gun ownership in the Black community and put forth a positive narrative about Black America\u2019s right to bear arms.\u00a0 With law enforcement mistrust\u00a0and\u00a0 crime at an all-time high, according to Pew Research, these two myth busters see gun ownership as a means to create safe and thriving communities, as well as protect Black households and neighborhoods.\n    As a gun owner and award-winning photojournalist, with features in Rolling Stone, Buzzfeed, ABC News, National Geographic and the Washington Post Magazine, Lee has been laser-focused on creating positive imagery on Black people and guns. &#34;My work is not about me, it&#39;s about others and I utilize my camera as a tool to learn about people from all over,&#34; said Lee.\n    In a recent project, entitled \u201c Armed Doesn&#39;t Mean Dangerous,\u201d Lee photographs Black Americans with their firearms to dispel a longstanding myth about danger connected to Black Americans and their Second Amendment right to possess a firearm.\n    &#34;My subjects feel their lives might be threatened or put at risk because they have grown up without proper gun education,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Those who I photograph feel deeply that there is a new need to educate themselves and their families. Seeing the new rise of protest by far-right groups as a sign that they remain behind, these citizen have a learning curve when it comes to gun education and exercising their Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n  The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry&#39;s trade association, found that 40 percent of 2020&#39;s gun sales were to first-time buyers and that purchases by\u00a0 Black Americans skyrocketed by 56 percent, more than any other race.\n  According to Lee, many of the subjects he photographs are homeowners, professionals and members of the middle class, designations that have allowed them to escape much of the stigma attached to Black gun ownership in America.\n  &#34;What I found ironic is how people perceive African-American gun owners in my project,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI often wonder if their perceptions would change if my subjects lived in different ZIP codes or were photographed in attire that is stereotypically connected with violence, would that type of imagery infringe upon their access to the 2nd Amendment?&#34;\n  This open question is what has made gun ownership in the Black community so polarizing.\n  &#34;As a Chicago native, the reason why most Black folks don&#39;t want to be gun owners isn&#39;t because they are scared of guns themselves, but it is because much of the trauma in their communities are connected to guns. Whether it be the gun violence at the hands of a citizen or a police involved shooting, guns always seem to be the center piece,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Just look at the case of Breonna Taylor, she was found dead in home after a firearm was legally used to protect her and her family. This weird dynamic has casted a grave shadow on gun ownership for the Black community.&#34;\n  This is a shadow that LGBTQ activist, Second Amendment supporter and Black lesbian Paquita Wiggins is working to break down in the Black LGBTQ community. As a trained licensed architect and small business owner, Wiggins has started her own Black gay, lesbian, and transgendered gun club and become a leading voice in the fight for more Black LGBTQ gun ownership as a means of protection. &#34;One of the biggest misnomers about the Black Second Amendment community is that we are somehow ignorant and unprofessional \u2014 and this is far from the truth,&#34; said Wiggins.\n  &#34;The Black LGBTQ community has always been progressive, on both Black and LGBTQ issues. And while we have seen a lot of positive progress in policy change for the LGBTQ community, we have not seen those changes take root for the Black community, which we are also a part of,&#34; Wiggins added. &#34;This lack of change has caused gun interest and ownership in the Black LGBTQ community to grow. Owning firearms allows us to protect ourselves and our families from potential police violence and the rise in White Supremacy.&#34;\n  Wiggins was also quick to call out the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups for their lack of advocacy among Black gun owners and their active participation in making gun ownership harder for Black Americans throughout history.\n  Citing California&#39;s 1967 Mulford Act, an NRA-supported state bill prohibiting the open carry of loaded firearms, as an affront to the Black Panthers\u2019 calls for more Black gun-ownership, Wiggins said, &#34;For a long time in this country, gun laws and regulations revolved around removing guns from the hands and home of Black people.&#34;\n  The Black community is the fastest growing gun-owning demographic in the United States.\u00a0Driven by the dueling pandemics of COVID-19 and racial injustice, as well as a history of fighting for rights and freedoms against all odds, Black gun ownership has seen an increase that mirrors American culture&#39;s changing landscape.\n  &#34;As Black ownership continues to increase, we should be working to educate, inform, and empower those who want to be legal firearms owners,&#34; said Wiggins. &#34;A lot of people assume that you have to be part of the conservative movement to believe in the Second Amendment and we need to change that. In many instances the Black community, especially those that identify as queer, are unprotected and vulnerable and those realities can be changed with personal and legal gun ownership.&#34;\n  As Wiggins&#39; Black LGBTQ gun club continues to grow, she is focused on creating gun owner clinics on state and local gun laws, and monthly meet-ups at the gun range to improve her members\u2019 accuracy and comfort in utilizing their legal firearms.\n  Lee and Wiggins are not trying to convince their communities that gun-ownership is a must. Instead, they want African Americans to see positive images of themselves when it comes to legal gun ownership. They also want American society at large to not fear Black gun owners when they see them in the community.\n  &#34;Owning a firearm is a right afforded to all Americans. So regardless of how someone feels when they see a Black person with a gun, we as a nation must condition ourselves to know that it is acceptable,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Some Black citizens are going to exercise their Second Amendment right and others are not. Those that choose to exercise their rights, should be allowed to without fear of their lives.&#34;\n  While Black gun ownership continued to rise during the pandemic, numbers are now starting to stabilize. According to the FBI&#39;s NICS Adjusted Background Check System \u2014 a database used to conduct background checks on people who want to own a firearm or explosive, as required by law \u2014\u00a0\u00a0 gun background checks were down 17 percent in May 2021 from a year ago.\u00a0May 2021 background checks were the second strongest for the month on record, only to be surpassed by May 2020, when background checks for firearms totaled 1.6 million.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:22:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

...... ", "note_en": "The woman was to show up at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at 9 a.m. to view the document, and department officials weren\u2019t entirely sure what was going to happen from there. Two lawyers with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would be present. An archivist specializing in historical artifacts had been brought in. Armed guards \u2014 four of them \u2014 would watch over the meeting to make sure that everything went over smoothly. No funny business. No sudden moves. Everyone figured this document viewing on May 25 near Denver International Airport would be an emotional one for the woman. She\u2019d already been sitting in her car in the parking lot outside, crying, since midnight, steeling herself for what was about to occur.\n In fact, Julia Turing had been rehearsing this moment for weeks, anticipating it for years.\n   In early 2018, federal agents had seized a number of historical artifacts from Julia\u2019s Conifer home that had originally belonged to British code breaker and computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the subject of  The Imitation Game,  a biopic starring Benedict Cumberbatch released in 2014. That\u2019s when most people learned about Turing. They learned about Julia in 2020, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office  filed a complaint that accused her of stealing Turing\u2019s belongings from a British boarding school during the 1980s. News outlets around the world ranging from the  Associated Press to the  BBC ran stories quoting the government\u2019s court filings about this strange Colorado woman who had devoted much of her life to an early-twentieth-century math genius, had purportedly taken some of his posthumous relics without permission, and had even changed her last name to match his in some kind of homage. What was behind Julia Turing\u2019s obsession? Derangement? A kind of fetish? Or something else?\n    In all the coverage, one thing was missing: Julia\u2019s own voice. Not until  Westword reached the 59-year-old via a P.O. box listed on some court documents did any media outlet obtain her side of the story.\n   In the late 1960s, the little brown-haired girl was finally enjoying a period of relative peace when her mother returned to pluck her off the front porch of her first foster home. Known then as Julie Ann Schwinghamer, the child had been cared for by a Native American family near Squaw Valley, California, after both of Julia\u2019s parents had abandoned her. Her father had left the family when Julia was three. Her mother had taken to the bottle, then Valium, all the while prone to violent outbursts.\n  In contrast, living with a foster family and running barefoot around the countryside was like a dream\u2026until Julia\u2019s mother came calling. Julia now says her mother had discovered that she could claim additional welfare with little Julia under her roof. And so her chaotic family life picked up where it had left off, this time in the regional farming hub of Dinuba, California. Fights and screaming matches, including with Julia\u2019s brother, were almost daily occurrences. Amid the chaos, Julia didn\u2019t learn to read or write, and the local elementary school held her back in second grade. She tried running away multiple times. Still, Julia had her momentary escapes, including the movies. And so on one hot summer afternoon, when Julia\u2019s mom wanted her out of the house, she went to the cinema on Dinuba\u2019s main street to see what was playing. The film was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic,  2001: A Space Odyssey.\n \u201cI was really drawn into it,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cAnd what disturbed me most was HAL 9000.\u201d\n She\u2019d never seen nor imagined anything like the talking computer in Kubrick\u2019s film, which infamously turns on its human masters once they\u2019ve left Earth\u2019s orbit. The image of HAL\u2019s unblinking red eye wore on her until Julia did something she\u2019d never done before: She went to the public library.\n Timidly, the girl asked the librarian, \u201cDo you have anything about machines that talk?\u201d\n The librarian was confused at first, until she placed a finger on what Julia was asking about.\n  She handed Julia a couple of books, but they weren\u2019t much use to a girl who couldn\u2019t read. After flipping through pages of dense text, Julia returned to the shelves to find something more visual. She hit paydirt with a bound volume containing pictures of early computers. The photographs mesmerized the child: all those beeping machines, some of them taking up entire rooms.\n But nothing prepared her for a photograph tucked away toward the back of the book. It wasn\u2019t of a machine, but of a man.  A man whom many historians regard as the pioneer of computer algorithms, the general-purpose computer, and a founding father of both theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\n   \u201cThe moment I saw his face, it was like I knew him,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cIt was an odd feeling of extreme familiarity.\u201d\n Taking the book home, she kept the volume open to the picture for the duration of her library loan. Then she checked it out again.\n When her mother caught sight of the book, she scoffed. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n So began a lifetime of teasing and misunderstanding over Julia\u2019s reverence for Alan Turing. Julia just couldn\u2019t articulate it. How to explain that this image felt alive to her? Somehow, she was bound to Alan Turing.\n  \u201cMy thought was, is Alan Turing alive? Because I would like to meet him,\u201d she recalls.\n Julia\u2019s desire to know everything she could about Alan Turing propelled her to learn to read and write. That\u2019s when she discovered that the mathematician had died in 1954, and that his legacy extended far beyond computers. In fact, Turing had even been an accomplished marathon runner.\n Julia was inspired. Not only did she start excelling in school, but she followed Turing\u2019s footsteps into track and field. The quiet girl whose family had told her she\u2019d never amount to anything began to run. And run. And run.\n \u201cSoon I became the fastest runner in school,\u201d she says. \u201cMy teachers couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n  This run continued after Julia was put up for adoption and settled in with a foster family in Morro Bay, California. Going by the last name of Elliott (her step-father&#39;s name) in high school, Julia began breaking regional track records, even running an 11.5-second 100-meter dash, according to the May 15, 1980, edition of the  Sun-Bulletin newspaper.   She was propelled by a growing inspiration for Alan Turing. \u201cHe was my father figure, all the way up until I was nineteen,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThen it changed drastically from there.\u201d\n      Although Julia felt intimately connected to Turing, she was disturbed by how little she knew of his personal life. But she was hardly alone in that regard in the 1980s. Alan Turing remained relatively obscure until 2012,  when the British government declassified key documents that revealed the extent to which his code-breaking skills helped to undermine the Germans\u2019 enigma machine in World War Two, changing the course of the war and giving the Allies a significant advantage over their Nazi adversaries.\n  \u201cBut back then there was so little information about him, and I was hungry to learn more,\u201d Julia remembers. \u201cFor instance, I still didn\u2019t really understand the situation of how he died.\u201d\n For details like that, Julia had to dig deep. She tracked down books from England and sought primary source material. That\u2019s when she started learning that Turing had endured a tumultuous personal life of his own. It came to a head in 1952, when he was prosecuted for homosexual acts \u2014 then still a crime in the U.K. \u2014 after he had reported a petty burglary and had admitted to having a male lover in his house. After being found guilty of \u201cgross indecency,\u201d Turing was subjected to chemical castration. The English government forced him out of the secret service, and just weeks before his 42nd birthday, Turing was found dead at his home. An inquest found his death to be suicide by cyanide poisoning.\n But in 1984, Julia \u2014 then 22 years old \u2014 only knew some of these specifics. To find out more about Turing, she decided to make a trip to England. She used money that an insurance company had paid her following a car accident to buy her plane ticket.\n In England, Julia hit the ground running. She toured the universities where Turing had once walked the stone corridors, either as a student or a researcher. These included Oxford, Cambridge and King\u2019s College. At each school, she requested to view any archived material available on Turing, but archivists and librarians were suspicious. Who was this American lady, and why was she so interested in Turing? Julia remembers being disappointed that her access was so limited.\n  She was about to give up on school archives when she remembered one more institution that Turing had attended from 1926 to 1931, when he was a teenager: Sherborne School, a prestigious,  all-boys boarding school in Dorset.\n It was here that Julia finally got access to the types of artifacts she was looking for. Turing\u2019s mother had donated many items to the school between 1965 and 1967; they included things like Turing\u2019s school reports, photographs, medals (including Turing\u2019s OBE \u2014 Officer of the Order of the British Empire \u2014 which is similar to the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the U.S.) and school certificates, among them his Ph.D. diploma in mathematics from Princeton University.\n  Julia was amazed to find herself face to face with so many important items from Turing\u2019s life. These were things that he had held, had interacted with, had \u2014 even for a minute \u2014 contemplated and diverted some of his genius to. Julia felt Turing\u2019s presence like never before.\n Given Turing\u2019s obscurity at the time, it wasn\u2019t surprising that the Sherborne librarian told her that people rarely came to look at the Turing archive.\n  What happened next all those years ago is at the heart of the recent legal mess. While the librarian did not give Julia permission to take any items, Julia also spoke to the school\u2019s treasurer, Colonel A.W. Gallon.\n According to Julia, Gallon confirmed that visitors rarely came to see the Turing archive. She says that after she shared her troubled life story with Gallon, including how Turing was so inspirational to her, Gallon told her that she could take Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma, since it meant so much to her.\n  While there is no direct evidence to document Julia\u2019s version of this conversation, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that Gallon later supported the idea that Julia could keep the Ph.D. But things get sticky from there, because Julia did steal from the school.\n Julia returned to Sherborne after her initial visit to view the items a second time. When the librarian left her side and she found herself alone, the librarian\u2019s comment about so few people caring to visit the Turing archive rang through her mind. Her heart raced as an irrepressible urge welled up.\n \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Julia says. \u201cI was young. I felt that Alan Turing\u2019s things were in danger because no one really wanted them and they were just sitting there. So I made a mistake. I took some items.\u201d\n According to a memo written by Gallon after he retired in 1989, Sherborne wasn\u2019t aware of the theft until Julia contacted the school soon after her visits.\n \u201cI did not see her again but she wrote expressing her joy at having a collection of Turing items, and included photo of them laid out on a table \u2014 his photo, OBE &amp; so on,\u201d Gallon wrote. \u201cI was not aware that she had taken them, nor indeed was the librarian! I asked him [the librarian] to make a list of the missing items but it proved to be incomplete because we had no inventory anyway\u2026I gave up any hope of ever getting A.T.\u2019s things back \u2018til one day she wrote saying she was sending them back. A parcel arrived. It contained more than the Librarian had listed which made me cross.\u201d\n Both Sherborne and Julia saved some of the correspondence between her and Gallon \u2014 which recently became exhibits in the government\u2019s case in Colorado.\n  After returning many of the items to Sherborne \u2014 indeed, more than the school\u2019s librarian knew existed \u2014 Julia wrote:  Please forgive me for what I did. I know what I did was wrong\u2026.I want you to know that it was very hard for me to steel [sic]. For I have never stolen before in my life and did feel very badly for taking them.\n   Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   I do hope that I have your name right\u2026If the Turing memorabilia arrived safely then all will be forgotten as far as we are concerned. I think I can understand how you have felt and what motivated you is an action out of character with your normal self. Thank you for phoning. It was such a great relief for us when you chose to respond, and I repeat my invitation to come and continue and research in the future.\n On August 20, he followed up to confirm receipt of the items, while noting that Julia did not return one photograph.\n  Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   You will be pleased to know that the parcel arrived safely and I am grateful to you for what is a very [illegible] gesture and one of which Alan Turing [illegible] would be proud. I am sorry that you have retained the one photograph. Particularly as there was a negative among the collection from which you could have had another one done. I have now [illegible] here, and because of your action, you may keep the photograph. I have told the police here that you have returned all but the photograph and that as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. I hope that they will pass this on to the police there, but you will have this letter to show them in case you are questioned.\n Julia seemed to have taken the words \u201cthe matter is closed\u201d at their fullest implication.\n What Gallon likely didn\u2019t know (his letters and memo never mentioned it) was that Julia still had a number of items, including a miniature version of his OBE medal. For Julia, after Gallon declared the matter closed, it seemed that anything she still had of Turing\u2019s was rightfully hers. Once again, his spirit had come through their cosmic connection and made everything work out. Her love for Turing only grew.\n Sometime in early 1988, Julia legally changed her name to Julia Mathison Turing, in a play off of Turing\u2019s father\u2019s name, Julius Mathison Turing. \u201cI was done with being bounced around from place to place and from name to name,\u201d she explains. \u201cI took his name because I thought it was appropriate. He saved my life.\u201d\n The name change was reflected in Julia\u2019s next correspondence with Gallon. Because despite matters being \u201cclosed\u201d in 1984, Julia needed his assistance again a few years later.\n The bizarre episode occurred in late 1988, when Julia had a domestic dispute with a foster sister, Carol Elliot, with whom she was again living in Morro Bay. Carol and Julia had always had a contentious relationship.  According to Julia, Carol thought she was a freak because of her adulation of Alan Turing, and she knew how important the Turing artifacts were to Julia.\n  After an argument over Carol\u2019s boyfriend, whom Julia threatened to report for alleged criminal behavior, Carol took Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma and a couple of his photos to the Morro Bay Police Department and told the cops that Julia had stolen them from Sherborne School in England.\n  On September 15, 1988, Julia wrote Gallon, pleading with him to return the diploma to her:\n I am sure that Alan is as sorrowful as I am over my terrible loss of his Ph.D. If there was only some way you could understand just how much Alan means to me. I believe maybe you would allow Alan\u2019s Ph.D. to remain with me until I would eventually return it as I had promised, because you have shown me your generosity to me [sic] before.\n Incredibly, Gallon seemed swayed by Julia\u2019s letters and decided to send back the diploma. On November 19, he wrote:\n Dear Miss Turing:  Thank you for your long letter and the press cuttings. I have written to Sgt. Beuer of the Morro Bay Police saying that you may keep the diploma. If I am too late and it arrives here, I will send it back to you.\n Authorities in Colorado located these letters, along with a customs declaration from Britain, that seem to support this twist in the story: Gallon did gift the Ph.D. diploma \u2014 along with a couple of Turing photos \u2014 to Julia. In fact, rather than being angry with Julia, Gallon even said that he was rooting for her success as an officer in the U.S. Army and as a standout track-and-field star:\n Good luck with the Olympic selection. We shall be looking out for you in 1992.\n At least Gallon wasn\u2019t being misled about Julia\u2019s career accomplishments. They were unbelievable yet true.\n  \u201cFaster than a private dodging his platoon sergeant, speedier than an M-16 on rapid fire, able to leap the Headquarters building with a single bound, look out Flo Jo, here comes Lt. Turing.\u201d U.S. Army writer Cliff Jackson wrote that at the start of an April 11, 1990, article titled \u201cThe Champion\u201d for the newspaper that served Julia\u2019s Army posting in Stuttgart, Germany.\n  The piece continued: \u201c2nd Lt. Julia M Turing is one of the 11th Chemical Company\u2019s platoon leaders. How fast is she? In a 200 meter dash her average time is 22:88; when you compare that time to the world class time of 20.5, that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at.\u201d\n More than a dozen newspaper articles document Julia\u2019s career record as a track star. They range from coverage of her accomplishments in high school (fourth in California\u2019s state finals) to winning the 100, 200 and 400 meter races in the 1988  Community College State Championships in California. After completing her higher  education at Arizona State University, Julia donned a uniform for the Army and continued running as a member of the Armed Forces. In 1990, she was named the military\u2019s \u201cService Athlete of the Year.\u201d  Stars and Stripes noted that she was \u201cthe sixth fastest sprinter in the U.S.A.\u201d\n With headlines like \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d \u2014 that one from the  Star Presidian of San Francisco \u2014 articles took note of her difficult upbringing and overcoming the challenges of being shuttled between foster families. One article also mentioned that an \u201cAllen A. Turing\u201d [sic] was Julia\u2019s inspiration.\n But then duty called, and Julia\u2019s running career took a break as the U.S. military prepared to invade Iraq. A lieutenant in the Army\u2019s Chemical Company, Julia was stationed in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm, where she briefed incoming soldiers on possible sources of chemical attacks from Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces.\n Julia worried that her deployment would hamper her quest to represent the United States at the Olympics, but after returning from the Middle East, she won six gold medals at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships, breaking a 39-year military record for the most gold medals at a single event.\n  She was at the peak of her training when she arrived at the Olympic trials in Barcelona, Spain \u2014 the final, qualifying event for the 1992 Olympic games. But she also arrived in the Catalonian capital with multiple running-related injuries. Reporters wanted to know: Could she push through it? Julia said that she would try to overcome any pain and give \u201c101 percent,\u201d just as she had at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships.\n But as the deadline approached, Julia\u2019s foot was killing her. She finally got it X-rayed, and doctors found that she had broken it in two places.

Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals \u2014 from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers.\n  Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance. It\u2019s important to get your employment ducks in a row long before you start planning your exit.\n What follows is an overview of the three main categories of employment issues that can derail or delay a sale. For the most part, these assume an asset sale, but may vary in the case of a stock sale.\n  By far the most significant problem is general employment law compliance. This means creating strong employment policies and practices that are documented, in place and operating long before you pursue a deal.

We covered a range of topics including how Sara and Ben decided who would be CEO, what it\u2019s like leading a small but growing team, and how to evaluate your decisions as a founder, and commit to a course of action to move forward.\n Sara was extremely candid with us about her experience as a founder and CEO, and this is definitely one of our most open and honest conversations to date.\n  We loved our time chatting with Sara, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode.

describes itself as a \u201cfood meets friends\u201d \u2014 essentially a social commerce platform for ordering from restaurants, with \u201csnack\u201d, the CEO tells me, of having a double meaning of eating (of course), and a flirtatious reference to a cutie pie \u2014 has picked up a $70 million, a super-sized Series B that it will be using to continue expanding to more markets in the U.S.\n Conceived four years ago while Kevin Tan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Jamie Marshall, was still a student at Yale studying physics, Snackpass has grown by remaining true to its higher-ed roots. The startup now has 500,000 users across 13 college towns, and has seen its growth explode 7x in the last three months alone. This round values the startup at over $400 million.\n  This latest tranche of funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Led by Craft Ventures, it also includes Andreessen Horowitz (which led its  $21 million Series A), General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and a long list of individual backers that speaks to the attention Snackpass is getting and the place it\u2019s carving out for itself as a go-to food platform for millennials and younger users.\n That list includes AirAngels, the Airbnb alumni investor syndicate; Bastian Lehmann of the Uber-acquired delivery giant Postmates (et tu, Bastian?); David Grutman, a Miami-based hospitality entrepreneur; Draymond Green of the San Francisco Warriors; Gaingels; HartBeat Ventures, Kevin Hart\u2019s venture fund; musician celebs the Jonas Brothers; Shrug Capital (the VC that says it\u2019s interested in consumer startups that are actually interesting to \u201c non-tech\u201d audiences); Stephen Paglucia, co-owner of the Boston Celtics; hip DJ Steve Aoki; Turner Novak of Banana Capital; William Barnes of Moving Capital; and the Uber alumni investor syndicate.\n The vast majority of food-ordering platforms these days are focused around delivery and in many cases ways of getting an edge over other platforms in executing on that \u2014 a push that often comes at the expense of margins than are thinner than a Roman pizza. Snackpass\u2019s big breakthrough, if you could call it that, was to simply dial back from that one-upmanship, moving away from that premise altogether, aiming to disrupt something much more mundane: the queue.\n Tan said Snackpass asked its users what they would do if they weren\u2019t using the app, and they said, \u201cOh, I just stand in line to order,\u201d he told me in an interview.\n \u201cThe market share right now is owned by people standing in line at the register, and placing their order. Our vision is that in five years that will no longer exist, like, there will be no more registers. We don\u2019t think it makes any sense.\u201d\n He notes that for those who really want delivery, people can opt for that, too \u2014 Snackpass integrates with DoorDash, UberEats and others to fulfill that \u2014 but 90% of the orders on Snackpass are pickup, meaning that not only does the company then not have to deal with its own fleets of delivery people, and the infrastructure of that, but the operating costs to provide that are also not there.\n It turns out that actually a lot of young people seem happy to pop out to get something nice to eat. It means they get to socialise, and take a selfie with their food or drink (boba tea figures strongly) at the venue where it\u2019s being bought. It becomes an experience.\n It\u2019s also where the market is in another sense. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is delivery is only 8% of the restaurant industry,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cAnd while it\u2019s very much competed for by like big companies, and it\u2019s a huge market, the restaurant industry, is like, much bigger, it\u2019s $800 billion. And 90% of that purchasing is still offline,\u201d he continued, referring to the many people who just queue up, order, buy, and leave. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous, and it\u2019s on the verge of disruption. And we\u2019re focused on that much bigger blue ocean.\u201d\n Its formula seems to be working with its target users. Tan said that the service has\u00a080% penetration with students in the markets where it has launched. The average customer orders four and a half times a month, with some customers ordering every day. \u201cYou can actually see that it\u2019s like, five to ten times more engagement than the delivery platforms, like UberEats or DoorDash.\u201d\n The company\u2019s commissions vary and start at 7% and it\u2019s current suite includes online ordering, self-service kiosks, digital menus, marketing services, and a customer referral program. It\u2019s already profitable but as it continues to grow (and maybe extend to other demographics) you can imagine it adding and expanding on all of these.\n There is something about Snackpass that reminds me a lot of Snapchat, not just that the names have a similar ring to them, and not just that they have resonated with college-aged users (and not just that they both squarely target them). It\u2019s something of the whimsy of the app, and how it takes a light touch in its approach to do something that might otherwise feel cumbersome, or mundane, or what, basically, older people do.\n Right now, there isn\u2019t much of a social \u201cuser graph\u201d per se on Snackpass, nor does it integrate particularly deeply with any specific social apps, but you could imagine a partnership there down the line, especially considering that Snap is getting a whole lot more involved with commerce now.\n \u201cIn building a social experience around food through shared rewards, gifting, and a social activity feed, Snackpass has created a dynamic and attractive restaurant ordering system,\u201d says Bryan Rosenblatt, partner, Craft Ventures, in a statement. \u201cThe growth of its marketplace and virality of the product coupled with Snackpass\u2019 outstanding \u00a0team and vision, make it the ultimate solution for consumers and businesses alike. We are thrilled to help take Snackpass to the next level with this latest round of funding.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:44:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u793e\u4f1a,platform", "title": "Snackpass\u541e\u566c7000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u4e3a400\u7c73+\u4f30\u4ef7\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u98df\u54c1\u8ba2\u8d2d\u5e73\u53f0\u8de8\u8d8a500k\u7528\u6237 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSnackpass gobbles up $70M at a $400M+ valuation as its social food ordering platform crosses 500k users\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/snackpass-gobbles-up-70m-at-a-400m-valuation-as-its-social-food-ordering-platform-crosses-500k-users/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u793e\u4f1a", "platform"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8587788a7fc806d4b0eb5c3785bb28b4.jpg", "infoid": 1067800, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u8ba1\u5212\u4ece\u7ebd\u7ea6\u603b\u90e8\u7981\u6b62\u5de5\u4eba\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u6536\u5230Covid-19\u75ab\u82d7\u3002\u8be5\u89c4\u5219\u4e5f\u5c06\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\n \u6839\u636e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0cMorgan Stanley\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u90fd\u4f1a\u533a\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u90fd\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e2d\u4e0eA\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u578b\u5458\u5de5\u5b58\u5728\uff06\uff0334;\u9700\u8981\u57287\u67081\u65e5\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u3002\n \u6e90\u5934\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u75ab\u82d7\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6216\u6709\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u8bbf\u5ba2\u7684\u8363\u8a89\u57fa\u7840\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u671f\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u3002\n     \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\u96c7\u5458\u548c\u5ba2\u4eba\u6269\u5927\u96c7\u5458\u548c\u5ba2\u4eba\u57287\u670812\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u53ca\u97e6\u65af\u5f7b\u65af\u7279\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u5730\u533a\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u6388\u6743\u3002\n   \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u4e3e\u8d77\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u90e8\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4f53\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u66f4\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6e90\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u3002\n  \u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\uff08MS\uff09\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98James Gorman\u5148\u524d\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u66fe\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u4e0a\u66fe\u5728\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bc4\u8bba\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u94f6\u884c\uff06\uff0339;\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\u56de\u5230\u603b\u90e8\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u5927\u82f9\u679c\u548c\uff0339;\u65f6\u4ee3\u5e7f\u573a\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u53bb\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u7684\u4e00\u5bb6\u9910\u9986\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6208\u5c14\u66fc\u8bf4\u3002\u4ed6\u8fd8\u8b66\u544a\u4ed6\u4f1a\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u975e\u5e38\u5931\u671b\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u5982\u679c\u5de5\u4eba\u9003\u79bb\u52b3\u52a8\u8282\u7684\uff06\uff0339;\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

The rule will apply to non-vaccinated guests and clients as well.\n According to a source close to the company, Morgan Stanley said in a memo to its employees in the New York metropolitan area that all staff working in buildings with a &#34;large employee presence&#34; are required to confirm their vaccination status by July 1.\n The source added that &#34;vaccine attestation is on an honorary basis for employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors.&#34; The Financial Times was the first to  report the news.\n     The company plans to expand the vaccination mandate to employees and guests in other Morgan Stanley locations in New York City and nearby Westchester starting July 12.\n   &#34;Operating within a fully vaccinated environment allows us to lift restrictions like the use of face coverings and the need to maintain physical distancing, returning to more normal office conditions,&#34; the source added.\n  Morgan Stanley  (  MS) CEO James Gorman has previously taken a hard line on employees  returning to the office: Gorman commented at an investing conference earlier this month that it was time for the bank&#39;s New York workers to head back to the headquarters in the Big Apple&#39;s Times Square.\n  &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said. He also warned he would be &#34;very disappointed&#34; if workers aren&#39;t back by Labor Day. And if they&#39;re not, then &#34;we&#39;ll have a different kind of conversation,&#34; he said.\n Gorman added at the time that more than 90% of its workers have said they have already received the vaccine and that he expects this number to eventually hit 98% to 99%.\n He did note some employees may choose to not get vaccinated for health or religious reasons, adding that the company will deal with these situations on a case-by-case basis.\n Even more than other industries,  Wall Street is in a rush to turn the page on the pandemic era of remote work.\n   Goldman Sachs  (  GS) asked its employees to be back at the office last week, and it ordered staffers to divulge whether they&#39;ve been vaccinated. Goldman is expecting 5,400 newly hired interns, analysts and associates in the office in addition to its returning employees.\n Meanwhile,  JPMorgan Chase  (  JPM) opened all of its US offices to employees with a 50% occupancy cap. Executives at the bank  informed staff that it expects all US-based employees back in the office by early July on a consistent rotational schedule, subject to the same 50% cap.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:37:01", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5458\u5de5,stanley", "title": "\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\u7981\u6b62\u672a\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u548c\u5ba2\u6237 ", "title_en": "Morgan Stanley's New York Office Bans Unvaccinated Staff and Clients", "transed": 1, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/investing/morgan-stanley-unvaccinated-employees-office/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5458\u5de5", "stanley"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1fdf7e8c6a82fa56236be6f622a651fd.jpg", "infoid": 1067798, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "NEORV32\u5904\u7406\u5668\u662f\u53ef\u6839\u636eRISC-V NEORV32 CPU\u7684\u82af\u7247\uff08SOC\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u8f83\u5927SOC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6216\u5373\u53ef\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u7acb\u5f0f\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9a\u5236/\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\n \u5f53\u6211\u5f00\u59cb\u6f5c\u5165\u65b0\u5174\u7684RISC-V\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u611f\u5230\u4e0d\u77e5\u6240\u63aa\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u5b66\u8005\uff0c\u5f88\u96be\u83b7\u5f97\u6982\u8ff0 -

The project is intended as auxiliary processor in larger SoC designs or as\u00a0 ready-to-go\u00a0stand-alone custom / customizable microcontroller.\n When I started to dive into the emerging RISC-V ecosystem I felt overwhelmed by the complexity. As a beginner it is hard to get an overview \u2013 especially when you want to setup a minimal platform to tinker with: Which core to use? How to get the right toolchain? What features do I need? How does the booting work? How do I create an actual executable? How to get that into the hardware? How to customize things?\u00a0  Where to start???\n So this project aims to provides a\u00a0 simple to understand\u00a0and\u00a0 easy to use\u00a0yet\u00a0 powerful\u00a0and\u00a0 flexible\u00a0platform that targets FPGA and RISC-V beginners as well as advanced users.\n The NEORV32 is not based on another RISC-V core. It was build entirely from ground up (just following the official ISA specs) having a different design goal in mind. The project does not intend to replace certain RISC-V cores or just beat existing ones like\u00a0 VexRISC\u00a0in terms of performance or\u00a0 SERV\u00a0in terms of size.\n The project aims to provide\u00a0 another option\u00a0in the RISC-V / soft-core design space with a different performance vs. size trade-off and a different focus:\u00a0 embrace\u00a0concepts like documentation, platform-independence / portability, RISC-V compatibility,\u00a0 customization\u00a0and\u00a0 ease of use.\n    Stop breadboarding and soldering \u2013 start making immediately!

Ever. Private, independent, and transparent, Brave Search is the real alternative to Google. On mobile, desktop, and anywhere the web takes you. Search private. Search with confidence.\n    Brave Search is the world\u2019s most complete, independent, private search engine. By integrating Brave Search beta into its browser, Brave offers the first all-in-one browser / search alternative to the big tech platforms. Brave Search beta is also available in other browsers, at  search.brave.com.\n  Yes, it\u2019s available to everyone at  search.brave.com. It can also be set as the default search engine in the Brave browser, if you choose to do so.\n Note that Brave Search beta is a work in progress, so results for some queries, regions, or languages may not yet be as refined as you\u2019d like. Please be patient, and please do tell us how we can improve (use the feedback icon on any results page). Rome, as they say, wasn\u2019t built in a day\u2014a perfect alternative to Google won\u2019t be either. But, with your help, it  will happen.\n    We do not believe in walled gardens, so you can also set Brave Search as the default search engine in most browsers. And, in the future, we plan to offer API access to Brave Search so it can power other search engines.\n  We\u2019re currently thinking through different search experiences to offer our users. Some want a premium, ad-free search experience. Others want a free, ad-supported model. We think choice is best. Brave Ads  with rewards is definitely possible, once we\u2019re ready to take on the challenge of privacy-protected search ads.\n  Most search engines\u2014even supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d ones\u2014don\u2019t have their own index. They\u2019re just fa\u00e7ades that rely exclusively on third-parties. At Brave, we want to build our own search index, because this means independence. And independence means choice. Choice for the user to have alternatives, and choice that allows Brave to not be beholden to the policies of third parties (e.g. censorship, biases, economic interests, etc).\n Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page. This mixing is a means-to-an-end toward 100% independence. For full transparency and to measure Brave\u2019s progress toward that goal, Brave provides a \u201cResults independence\u201d metric. This anonymous calculation shows the % of search results that come from Brave versus these third parties. Note that no matter the independence metric, your privacy will always be 100%.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:35:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8ddf\u8e2a,search,\u641c\u7d22", "title": "\u6ca1\u6709\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u52c7\u6562\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248 ", "title_en": "Search without a trace, Brave Search, beta release", "transed": 1, "url": "https://brave.com/search/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8ddf\u8e2a", "search", "\u641c\u7d22"]}]
