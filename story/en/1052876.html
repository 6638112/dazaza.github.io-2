It was written for the type of white person who considers themselves to be not-racist and thinks that they deserve recognition and praise for treating POC like they are actually human.”</p><p>  炒作火车在3月中旬出轨，但是，由Shauna Sinyard，一个书店员工和博主，他们主要是关于雅，并有不同的接受：“黑女巫是我读过的最危险，令人反感的书，”她在近9,000字的评论中写道，将小说爆炸为纯粹的巨大的巨额困境。 “它最终是为白人写的。它是为自己认为不是种族主义的白人的类型，并认为他们应该得到的认可和赞美，就像他们实际上是人类的处理。“</p><p>  The Black Witch centers on a girl named Elloren who has been raised in a stratified society where other races (including selkies, fae, wolfmen, etc.) are considered inferior at best and enemies at worst. But when she goes off to college, she begins to question her beliefs, an ideological transformation she’s still working on when she joins with the rebellion in the last of the novel’s 600 pages. (It’s the first of a series; one hopes that Elloren will be more woke in book two.)</p><p>  黑巫婆在一个名叫Elloren的女孩上举办的女孩，他在一个分层的社会中提出，其中其他比赛（包括Selkies，Fae，Wolfmen等）被认为是最佳和最糟糕的敌人。但是，当她去大学时，她开始质疑她的信仰，这是她在新颖的600页中的最后一页加入叛乱时仍在努力的思想转型。 （这是一个系列中的第一个;人们希望埃洛伦在书中醒来。）</p><p>  It was this premise that led Sinyard to slam  The Black Witch as “racist, ableist, homophobic, and … written with no marginalized people in mind,” in a review that consisted largely of pull quotes featuring the book’s racist characters saying or doing racist things. Here’s a representative excerpt, an offending sentence juxtaposed with Sinyard’s commentary:</p><p>  这是这个前提，导致SINADARD将黑巫婆猛击为“种族主义，能力，同性恋者，而不是没有边缘化的人，”在一篇主要是由书籍的种族主义字符的审查中撰写的审查中，这些评论中由书籍或做种族主义事物组成。这是一个代表性摘录，一个与Sinaind评论并列的违规句子：</p><p>  “pg. 163. The Kelts are not a pure race like us. They’re more accepting of intermarriage, and because of this, they’re hopelessly mixed.”</p><p>  “pg。凯尔茨不是我们这样的纯粹比赛。他们更接受通婚，因为这一点，他们绝望地混合了。“</p><p>  Yes, you just read that with your own two eyes. This is one of the times my jaw dropped in horror and I had to walk away from this book.</p><p>  是的，你只是用自己的两只眼睛读到这一点。这是我的下巴恐怖的次数之一，我必须离开这本书。</p><p>  In a tweet that would be retweeted nearly 500 times, Sinyard  asked people to spread the word about  The Black Witch by sharing her review — a clarion call for YA Twitter, which regularly identifies and denounces books for being problematic (an all-purpose umbrella term for describing texts that engage improperly with race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other marginalizations). Led by a group of influential authors who pull no punches when it comes to calling out their colleagues’ work, and amplified by tens of thousands of teen and young-adult followers for whom online activism is second nature, the campaigns to keep offensive books off shelves are a regular feature in a community that’s as passionate about social justice as it is about reading. And while not every callout escalates into a full-scale dragging, in the case of  The Black Witch — a book by a newcomer with a minimal presence online — the backlash was immediate and intense.</p><p>  在一个推文中，将近500次重新发布，Sineard要求人们通过分享她的评论来传播关于黑女巫的一词 - 这是对YA Twitter的一个明确呼吁，定期识别和谴责有问题的书籍（一个通用伞期用于描述与种族，性别，性取向，残疾和其他边缘化相互作用的文本。由一群有影响力的作者领导，在呼唤他们的同事的工作方面没有拳击，并将成千上万的青少年和年轻成人追随者放大，在线活动是第二种自然，这是将攻击性书籍的竞选活动货架是一个常规的特色，在一个关于社会正义的社区充满热情，因为它是关于阅读的。虽然并非每一个呼叫都升级为一个全面拖延，但在黑巫婆的情况下 - 一本新人在网上存在最小的存在 - 反弹是立即和激烈的。 </p><p>  Based almost solely on Sinyard’s opinion, the novel became the object of sustained, aggressive opposition in the weeks leading up its release. Its publisher, Harlequin Teen, was bombarded with angry emails demanding they pull the book.  The Black Witch’s Goodreads rating dropped to an abysmal 1.71 thanks to a mass coordinated campaign of one-star reviews, mostly from people who admitted to not having read it.  Twitter threads  damning  the novel  made  the rounds, while a  Tumblr post instructing users to “be an ally” and signal boost the outrage racked up nearly 6,000 notes. Sinyard kept a running tally of her review’s circulation; “11,714 views on my review of THE BLACK WITCH and .@HarlequinTEEN and .@laurieannforest have not commented,” she  tweeted. (That number  eventually swelled to 20,000.)</p><p>几乎完全基于Sinyard的意见，这部小说成为持续，积极的反对的对象，在几周内导致其发布。它的出版商丑角青少年被轰炸的电子邮件轰炸要求他们拉这本书。由于一颗星际评论的大规模协调活动，黑巫婆的Goodreads评级跌至Abysmal 1.71，主要来自入住没有阅读的人。 Twitter线程诅咒小说制作了圆形，而Tumblr帖子指示用户“是一个盟友”，并通过信号提升愤怒占据了近6000个音符。 Sineard保持着她的评论流通的跑步; “关于我对黑巫婆的评论的11,714次观点。@ Harlequinteen和。@ Laurieannforest尚未评论，”她发了推文。 （该数字最终膨胀至20,000。）</p><p>  Positive buzz all but died off, as community members began  confronting  The Black Witch’s supporters, demanding to know why they insisted on  reading a racist book. When Kirkus gave the novel a  glowing starred review, dozens of commenters demanded a retraction; the uproar was so intense that Kirkus ran a  follow-up essay by editor Vicky Smith on the difference between representation and endorsement: “The simple fact that a book contains repugnant ideas is not in itself, in my opinion, a reason to condemn it,” Smith wrote. “Literature has a long history as a place to confront our ugliness, and its role in provoking both thought and change in thought is a critical one.”</p><p>  正面嗡嗡声，但被摧毁了，因为社区成员开始面对黑女巫的支持者，要求知道为什么他们坚持读种族主书。当Kirkus给出新颖的一个发光主演的评论时，数十名评论者要求撤回;洪乱是如此强烈的是，Kirkus通过编辑Vicky Smith运行了一个后续文章，在代表性和认可之间的差异：“书籍中包含令人厌恶的想法的简单事实本身就是谴责它的理由， “史密斯写道。 “文学是一个悠久的历史，作为一个面对我们的丑陋的地方，其在激发思想和变革方面的作用是一个关键的作用。”</p><p>    “Mimi” (not her real name), a teen book blogger with a follower count in the thousands and who describes herself as “a huge fantasy reader,” was among those who had been looking forward to  The Black Witch — and she was initially thrilled to see Sinyard, an influential voice in the community, pick up the book. “I was really excited for what she was going to say about it. I thought it was going to be 600 pages of epic-ness,” she says. But her excitement soured when she caught wind of the book’s issues; just reading the sentences collected in Sinyard’s review and Twitter threads was painful, she says: “It hit me really hard. I’m so upset about it. It was very hurtful, and very, like, just harmful and triggering.”</p><p>    “咪咪”（不是她的真实姓名），一本青少年书籍博主，追随着追随者的数千次，谁将自己描述为“一个巨大的幻想读者”，是那些期待着黑巫婆的人之一 - 而且她最初是兴奋地看到Sinyard，在社区中有影响力的声音，拿起这本书。 “我真的很兴奋，因为她要对它说什么。我认为这将是600页的Epic-ness，“她说。但是当她抓住书的问题时，她的兴奋感到恶毒;只是阅读Sinyard的评论中收集的句子和Twitter帖子很痛苦，她说：“它狠狠地打了我。我对此感到很沮丧。这是非常伤害的，非常像，只是有害和触发。“</p><p>  The harm Mimi describes is central to campaigns like the one against  The Black Witch, which are almost always waged in the name of protecting vulnerable teens from dangerous ideas. These books, it’s claimed, are hurting children.</p><p>  伤害MIMI描述了像对阵黑女巫的那样的竞选活动，这几乎总是以保护脆弱的青少年从危险的想法中的名义。这些书籍，它被声称，伤害了孩子。</p><p>    But a growing number of critics say the draggings, well-intended though they may be, are evidence of a growing dysfunction in the world of YA publishing. One author and former diversity advocate described why she no longer takes part: “I have never seen social interaction this fucked up,” she wrote in an email. “And I’ve been in prison.”</p><p>    但越来越多的批评者表示，拖延，虽然它们可能是善意的，是雅斯出版世界越来越多的功能障碍。一个作者和前多样性倡导者描述了为什么她不再参与其中：“我从未见过社交互动这搞砸了，”她在一封电子邮件中写道。 “而且我一直在监狱。”</p><p>  Many members of YA Book Twitter have become culture cops,  monitoring their peers across  multiple platforms for violations. The result is a jumble of dogpiling and dragging, subtweeting and screenshotting, vote-brigading and flagging wars, with accusations of white supremacy on one side and charges of thought-policing moral authoritarianism on the other. Representatives of both factions say they’ve received threats or had to shut down their accounts owing to harassment, and all expressed fear of being targeted by influential community members — even when they were ostensibly on the same side. “If anyone found out I was talking to you,” Mimi told me, “I would be blackballed.”</p><p>  YA Book Twitter的许多成员已成为文化警察，监测他们对违规行为的多个平台的同行。结果是一场狗屎和拖动，拨动和截图，投票 - 宣传和标记战争，对另一方的白色至上的指责以及思想政策道德专制主义的指控。两个派系的代表都说他们已经接受了威胁或不得不在骚扰中关闭他们的账户，并且担心受到影响的社区成员的目标 - 即使他们在同一方面方向上。 “如果有人发现我在和你谈话，”咪咪告诉我，“我会被勒彻。”</p><p>  Dramatic as that sounds, it’s worth noting that my attempts to report this piece were met with intense pushback. Sinyard politely declined my request for an interview in what seemed like a routine exchange, but then announced on Twitter that our interaction had “scared” her, leading to backlash from community members who insisted that the as-yet-unwritten story would endanger her life. Rumors  quickly spread that I had threatened or  harassed Sinyard; several influential authors instructed their followers not to speak to me; and one librarian and member of the Newbery Award committee  tweeted at Vulture nearly a dozen times accusing them of enabling “a washed-up YA author” engaged in “a personalized crusade” against the entire publishing community (disclosure: while freelance culture writing makes up the bulk of my work, I published a pair of young adult novels in 2012 and 2014.) With one exception, all my sources insisted on anonymity, citing fear of professional damage and abuse.</p><p>  戏剧性的声音，值得注意的是，我试图报告这件作品的激增。 Sinyard礼貌地拒绝了我对似乎是常规交流的采访的要求，但随后在推特上宣布，我们的互动“害怕”她，导致社区成员的反弹，他们坚持不懈地危害她的生活。谣言迅速蔓延，我威胁或骚扰西明达;一些有影响力的作者指示他们的追随者不要跟我说话;一个图书馆员和纽伯奖委员会的成员在秃鹰上发布了近十几次，这些时间指责他们在整个出版社中从事“一个个性化的十字军作者”（披露：虽然自由文化写作弥补了我的大部分工作，我在2012年和2014年发表了一对年轻成人小说。）我的所有来源都坚持匿名，引起了担心专业损害和虐待。 </p><p>  None of this comes as a surprise to the folks concerned by the current state of the discourse, who describe being harassed for dissenting from or even questioning the community’s dynamics. One prominent children’s-book agent told me, “None of us are willing to comment publicly for fear of being targeted and labeled racist or bigoted. But if children’s-book publishing is no longer allowed to feature an unlikable character, who grows as a person over the course of the story, then we’re going to have a pretty boring business.”</p><p>这一切都不是对话语所关注的人民的意外，他们描述被骚扰从甚至质疑社区的动态而受到骚扰。一位着名的孩子的书籍代理人告诉我，“我们毫不一面愿意公开发表评论，因为害怕被定向和标记的种族主义或偏执。但是，如果儿童书籍出版不再允许一个不可能的角色，他们在故事的过程中变成一个人，那么我们将有一个非常无聊的业务。“</p><p>  Another agent, via email, said that while being tarred as problematic may not kill an author’s career — “It’s likely made the rounds as gossip, but I don’t know it’s impacting acquisitions or agents offering representation” — the potential for reputational damage is real: “No one wants to be called a racist, or sexist, or homophobic. That stink doesn’t wash off.”</p><p>  另一个代理商通过电子邮件表示，在被判处有问题时可能不会杀死作者的职业生涯 - “很可能会变成八卦，但我不知道它的影响或代理商提供代表” - 声誉损害的潜力是真实：“没有人想被称为种族主义或性别歧视或同性恋者。臭味不会洗掉。“</p><p>  Authors seem acutely aware of that fact, and are tailoring their online presence — and in some cases, their writing itself — accordingly. One New York  Times best-selling author told me, “I’m afraid. I’m afraid for my career. I’m afraid for offending people that I have no intention of offending. I just feel unsafe, to say much on Twitter. So I don’t.” She also scrapped a work in progress that featured a POC character, citing a sense shared by many publishing insiders that to write outside one’s own identity as a white author simply isn’t worth the inevitable backlash. “I was told, do not write that,” she said. “I was told, ‘Spare yourself.’</p><p>  作者似乎敏锐地意识到这一事实，并在某些情况下定制了他们的在线存在 - 他们的写作本身 - 因此。一位纽约时报畅销作者告诉我，“我害怕。我害怕我的职业生涯。我害怕冒犯我无意冒犯的人。我只是觉得不安全，在推特上说太多。所以我没有。“她还报废了一项进展的工作，以赋予PoC字符，引用许多出版的内部人分享的感觉，即在一个白色作者作为一个白色作者写出以外的自己的身份，这根本不值得不可避免的反弹。 “我被告知，不要写，”她说。 “我被告知，”备自己。“</p><p>  Another author recalled being instructed by her publisher to stay silent when her work was targeted, an experience that she says resulted in professional ostracization. “I never once responded or tried to defend my book,” she wrote in a Twitter DM. Her publisher “did feel I was being abused, but felt we couldn’t do anything about it.”</p><p>  另一个作者召回被她的出版商指示在她的工作瞄准时保持沉默，这是她所说的经验导致专业排斥。 “我从来没有回复过或试图捍卫我的书，”她在Twitter DM写道。她的出版商“感觉我被虐待，但觉得我们对此无法做任何事情。”</p><p>  The only person I spoke with who agreed to be identified by her real name was Francina Simone, a self-published author and YouTuber who has disengaged from the YA community over what she sees as disrespectful and unproductive discussions about diversity. “They’re shouting at the people who already agree with them,” she says. “It sucks to say, but the fear is valid in that you will get dragged if you say, ‘Hey, maybe we shouldn’t tell this author to kill herself because one of her characters said something offensive.’” (Simone’s description is an exaggeration, but not by much. At the height of the pushback against  The Black Witch, Forest was being derided as  a Nazi sympathizer and accused of  palling around with white supremacists, while those who  questioned the tone of the discourse were  rebuked for coded bigotry.)</p><p>  我唯一谈到的人同意被她的真名识别的是弗朗纳斯西蒙，一个自我发表的作者和Youtuber，他们从雅社会中脱离了她认为是关于多样性的不尊重和不生产的讨论。 “他们说，他们对已经同意他们的人大喊大叫，”她说。 “它很糟糕，但是恐惧是有效的，因为如果你说，'嘿，也许我们不应该告诉这个作者杀死自己，因为她的一个人物说了令人反感的话。'”（Simone的描述是夸张，但不是很多。在反对黑巫婆的接力处，森林被嘲笑为纳粹同情者，并被指控与白人至本的主义者一起徘徊，而那些质疑话语的基调的人被谴责为编码的偏见。）</p><p>    The diversity-in-publishing debate is very much at the root of the outrage when it comes to campaigns like the one against  The Black Witch, reflecting larger dissatisfaction with an industry that’s overwhelmingly white at just about every level. The multiyear push for more diverse books has yielded disappointing results — the  latest statistics show that authors of color are still underrepresented, even as books about minority characters are on an uptick — and while the loudest critics demanded that  The Black Witch be dropped by its publisher, others simply expressed exhaustion at the ubiquity of books like it. In a representative tweet,  author L.L. McKinney wrote, “In the fight for racial equality, white people are not the focus. White authors writing books like #TheContinent or #TheBlackWitch, who say it’s an examination of racism in an attempt to dismantle it, you. don’t. have. the. range.” (McKinney did not respond to multiple interview requests.)</p><p>    在像黑巫婆那样的竞选活动中，愤怒的根源是愤怒的根源，反映了对每个水平的一个绝大多数白色的行业的更大不满。多年推动更多样化的书籍产生了令人失望的结果 - 最新统计数据显示，颜色的作者仍然不足，即使是关于少数民族角色的书籍在上升的情况下 - 虽然最响亮的批评者要求黑巫婆被出版商丢弃了黑巫区，其他人只是表达了像它的笨蛋的愚蠢。在代表性推文中，作者L.L. McKinney写道，“在争夺种族平等中，白人不是重点。白人作者写作像#thecontining或#thorblackwitch，他说这是对种族主义的考察，试图拆除它。别。有。这。范围。” （麦金尼没有回应多次面试要求。）</p><p>  Still, the interpretation of Forest’s novel as a 600-page paean to anti-miscegenation seems rare among those who’ve actually read it. On Amazon, where the book is currently rated 4.3 stars out of 5, reviews generally agree that the book is firmly anti-prejudice, and that Elloren’s long slog in the direction of enlightenment is a realistic depiction of the process by which an indoctrinated person begins to expand her worldview. (There, the most common criticism is that the book’s message of tolerance is heavy-handed.) However, just reading a so-called problematic book in order to judge its offensiveness for oneself is considered by many to be beyond the pale.</p><p>  尽管如此，对森林小说的解释为600页的止血剂似乎很少见到那些实际阅读的人。在亚马逊目前的评分为5分中，其中5分，5星级，一般认为这本书牢固地反偏见，而Elloren在启蒙方向的漫长的漫步是对灌输人员开始的过程的现实描绘扩大她的世界观。 （那里，最常见的批评是，这本书的宽容信息是沉重的。但是，只需阅读所谓的有问题的书籍，以便判断自己的冒险，许多人被认为超出苍白。 </p><p>    Author Tristina Wright was one of several who condemned would-be readers of called-out books, while young readers followed suit. “Imagine being so privileged you care about your own entertainment more than the hurt of marginalized people,” one  tweeted, while another  declared, “Reading a book specifically because it’s been called out for racism doesn’t make you a champion of independent thought. It makes you racist.”</p><p>作者Tristina Wright是谴责叫做书籍的读者的几个人之一，而年轻人追随衣服。 “想象一下，你关心你自己的娱乐，超过边缘化的人的伤害，”一个推文，另一个宣称，“专门读书，因为它被称为种族主义并没有让你成为一个独立思想的冠军。它让你变得种族主义。“</p><p>  Mimi, the teen blogger who had once been so excited about  The Black Witch, was among those who urged others to avoid the book, writing on her website and Twitter about the emotional pain it had caused her. She still hasn’t read it, and doesn’t plan to; she feels that Sinyard’s review tells her all she needs to know. “I trusted her take on it. She showed pictures from the book, and certain passages in the book, so it’s not like she was making it up,” Mimi says. And in the wake of the book’s release on May 2, Mimi is upset by the lack of response from Harlequin and galled by descriptions of the novel as pro-diversity and anti-prejudice. “I wanted the author and publisher to understand that there were people who were hurt by this,” she says. “But [Forest] says her book is for diversity, anti-homophobia, anti-racism, and it’s poking fun at all of us, like we did this all for nothing.”</p><p>  曾经对黑女巫曾经如此兴奋的青少年博主咪咪是那些敦促别人避开这本书的人之一，写在她的网站和推特上关于它导致她的情绪痛苦。她还没有读过它，不打算;她觉得SININAD的审查告诉她她所需要的一切。 “我相信她接受它。她展示了这本书的照片，以及书中的某些段落，所以它不像她在弥补它，“咪咪说。在本书5月2日的释放之后，MIMI因缺乏丑角的反应而感到沮丧，并且通过新颖的描述作为促进的多样性和反偏见。 “我希望作者和出版商了解有人受到了伤害的人，”她说。 “但是[森林]说她的书是用于多样性，反同性恋者，反种族主义，而且它在我们所有人都戳了乐趣，就像我们为此做出了这一切。”</p><p>  For her part, Laurie Forest is aware of the protests, and cautious in how she talks about them. Responding to questions via email, she wrote, “My publishing house and I felt that it was important to listen to the discussion and we were respectful of people’s opinions and the debate. It’s a worthwhile discussion. Published books belong to their readers and readers should feel comfortable being honest about their views.” But she also says her book’s pro-diversity message is genuine: “I think there is a need for diversity in all phases of publishing, and it’s exciting to see that happening.  The Black Witch explores what it’s like to grow up in a closed-minded culture, and its message is that people who may have been raised with prejudiced views can change for the better. But it takes time and education.”</p><p>  对于她的部分，劳里森林意识到抗议活动，以及她如何谈论它们的谨慎态度。她通过电子邮件回复问题，“我的出版社，我觉得倾听讨论很重要，我们尊重人们的意见和辩论。这是一个有价值的讨论。公布的书籍属于他们的读者，读者应该对他们的观点诚实感到舒服。“但她还说她的书的亲多样性消息是真实的：“我认为需要在出版的所有阶段进行多样性，并且看到发生这种情况是令人兴奋的。黑人探讨了在封闭式文化中长大的样子，它的信息是可能已经被偏见的观点提出的人可以改善。但这需要时间和教育。“</p><p>  Nevertheless, Mimi’s worry that the campaign against  The Black Witch was “all for nothing” isn’t entirely off base. It’s rare that a title will be pulled in response to anger on social media. In August 2016, E.E. Charlton-Trujillo’s  When We Was Fierce was  yanked from shelves on the eve of its release amid accusations that it stereotyped its black characters; several months later, Harlequin Teen  delayed YA fantasy  The Continent after author Justina Ireland  lambasted the book for employing white-savior tropes. But for the most part, those who spearhead the campaigns against problematic books seldom receive an official response.</p><p>  尽管如此，咪咪担心黑巫婆的运动是“无所事事”并不完全偏离基地。很少见到标题将是为了回应社交媒体的愤怒而被拉。 2016年8月，E.E.Charlton-Trujillo的当我们凶猛的时候被释放的前夕从货架上猛拉，并且它的指责是它的刻板印象;几个月后，布莱因青少年延迟雅·艾菲娜爱尔兰·爱尔兰兰德·爱尔兰吹嘘了雇用白救世主世界的书。但对于大多数人来说，那些刺激着针对有问题的书籍的竞选人士很少收到官方回应。</p><p>  Harlequin declined to comment for this piece, but another publisher at a big five imprint has a simple reason for staying out of the fray — “I truly don’t find those conversations of value, and I hope an author would feel the same” — as well as a message for readers like Sinyard who feel their campaigns deserve a response: “Get upset! I would say, continue to go get upset. It’s entirely your right. But if this were my author and we were having this conversation, I’d say, don’t respond, or block them. It’s not their position. It’s not their role. They are a reader. If they don’t like it, fine. As a publisher we are here to curate, defend, and protect fiction —  the author’s ability to create as he or she feels fit, to tell the stories that he or she feels fit, and to not let the book be affected by outside opinion except those who are close enough to advise on story. “</p><p>  丑角拒绝评论这件作品，但另一个出版商在一个大五个印记中有一个简单的理由，留出磨损 - “我真的没有找到价值的对话，我希望笔者感觉同样的感觉” - 以及像Sinyard这样的读者的信息，谁认为他们的运动值得回应：“感到沮丧！我会说，继续沮丧。这完全是你的权利。但如果这是我的作者，我们正在谈论这次谈话，我会说，不要回应或阻止它们。这不是他们的立场。这不是他们的角色。他们是读者。如果他们不喜欢它，很好。作为一名出版商，我们在这里策划，捍卫和保护小说 - 作者创造的能力，因为他或她感到适合，告诉他或她感觉适合的故事，除了外国观点之外不会让这本书受到影响那些足够接近的人来说是为了故事建议。 “</p><p>  As for the potential of these campaigns to affect a book’s sales, that same publisher is unconcerned. “There’s that line — there’s no such thing as bad press — and at some point people will buy it just to take a look at it so they can join the critical parade.” (Even  The Black Witch, which took one of the worst online beatings in recent memory, scored a No. 1 rating in Amazon’s department of “Teen &amp; Young Adult Wizards Fantasy” a few days after its release and has been overwhelmingly well-reviewed since.)</p><p>  至于这些活动的潜力影响书籍的销售，同样的出版商是不关心的。 “有那条线 - 没有糟糕的压力，而且在某些时候，人们会买到它只是为了看看它，所以他们可以加入批评游行。” （即使是黑女巫也在近年来记忆中占据了最糟糕的在线殴打之一，在发布后几天，亚马逊的“青少年＆amp;年轻的成人巫师幻想”中的第1条评级分享了第1位。自从。）</p><p>  Among the book-buying public, though, that parade may be mostly passing unnoticed. The scandals that loom so large on Twitter don’t necessarily interest consumers; instead, the tempest of these controversies remains confined to a handful of internet teapots where a few angry voices can seem thunderously loud. Still, some publishing professionals imagine that the outrage will eventually become powerful enough to rattle the industry. Another agent, who describes himself as devoted to diversity in publishing since before it became a mainstream concern, is ambivalent about the current state of affairs.</p><p>  然而，在书籍之中，游行可能主要通过被忽视。 Twitter这么大的丑闻不一定是兴趣消费者;相反，这些争议的暴风雨仍然被限制在少数互联网茶壶，其中一些愤怒的声音似乎大声喊叫。尽管如此，一些出版专业人士认为，愤怒最终会变得足够强大，以便拨浪流该行业。另一个代理人描述自己致力于出版以来的多样性，以来在成为主流问题之前，对目前的事态矛盾是矛盾的。 </p><p>  “I think we’re in a really ugly part of the process,” he says. “But as we’re trying to encourage a greater diversity of readers and writers, we need to be held accountable for our mistakes. Those books do need to get criticized, so that books which are written more mindfully, respectfully, and diligently become the norm.”</p><p>“我认为我们的过程中的一个非常丑陋的部分，”他说。 “但由于我们正试图鼓励更多的读者和作家，我们需要对我们的错误负责。那些书确实需要受到批评，所以那本书都是更加精致，恭敬地，努力成为常态的书籍。“</p><p>  It’s also a process in which tough questions lie ahead — including how callout culture intersects with ordinary criticism, if it does at all. Some feel that condemning a book as “dangerous” is no different from any other review, while others consider it closer to a call for censorship than a literary critique. Francina Simone, for one, falls firmly in the latter category. “People seem to want these books to validate them, and that’s almost completely impossible,” she says. “It would be like me watching  The Simpsons and saying, ‘It’s harmful to me, take it off the air.’ It’s baffling. People pretend as if there is no off switch. [The idea] that it shouldn’t be in the public atmosphere — I find it extremely funny that people don’t think that’s censorship.”</p><p>  这也是一个过程，其中艰难的问题是：如果它完全确实如此，古怪的文化与普通批评相交的过程。有些人认为将一本书谴责为“危险”与任何其他审查没有什么不同，而其他人则认为它更接近审查的审查而不是文学批评。 Francina Simone，一体，在后一种类别中牢牢落在后一类。 “人们似乎希望这些书来验证它们，这几乎完全是不可能的，”她说。 “这就像我看着辛普森一声说道，”这对我有害，把它从空中取出。“这是令人困惑的。人们假装好像没有关闭开关。 [这个想法]那不应该在公共场所 - 我发现人们不认为这是审查的极乐感到很有趣。“</p><p>  And even if it becomes an article of faith that certain books are harmful and shouldn’t exist, how to adjudicate the claims of harm is a question nobody seems able to answer. During our conversation, the ambivalent agent suggests that Twitter shaming is called for “when someone is resistant and won’t acknowledge when they’ve clearly made a mistake,” but hedges on the question of who gets to decide what a clear mistake looks like, or when an authorial decision is a shaming-worthy offense:</p><p>  即使它成为一篇信仰的文章，某些书籍是有害的，不应该存在，如何裁定伤害的索赔是一个问题似乎能够回答的问题。在我们的谈话中，矛盾的代理人表明，Twitter Shaming呼吁“当有人抵抗并且当他们清楚地犯了错误时，当他们显然犯了错误时，”但对谁对谁来决定一个明确的错误看起来像是这样的问题，或者当授权决定是一个羞辱值得的罪行：</p><p>  “I don’t have an easy answer to that. The problem with these sorts of conversations and debates online is that as soon as an accusation is made, the burden of proof is put on the accused party. You can make all sorts of allusions to  The Crucible. I don’t know what needs to be done. I’m certainly not happy with how it plays out.</p><p>  “我没有很容易的回答。这些谈话和在线辩论的问题是，一旦指控，证据负担就被告。您可以为坩埚制作各种典故。我不知道需要做什么。我肯定不满意它的爆发。</p><p>  “But,” he adds, “I don’t think the answer is to have everyone shut up and not criticize it.”</p><p>  “但是，”他补充道，“我不认为答案是让每个人都闭嘴，而不是批评它。”</p><p>  Twitter being Twitter, that outcome seems unlikely. In recent months, the community was bubbling with a dozen different controversies of varying reach — over Nicola Yoon’s   Everything Everything (for ableism), Stephanie Elliot’s   Sad Perfect (for being potentially triggering to ED survivors),   A Court of Wings and Ruin by Sarah J. Maas (for heterocentrism),   The Traitor’s Kiss by Erin Beaty (for misusing the story of Mulan), and   All the Crooked Saints by Maggie Stiefvater (in a peculiar example of  publishing pre-crime, people had decided that Stiefvater’s book was racist before she’d even finished the manuscript.)</p><p>  Twitter是Twitter，结果似乎不太可能。最近几个月，社区冒充了几十个不同的攻击争论，不同的距离 - 在尼古拉··········埃洛里的一切（以埃尔蒂奥特的一切（潜在触发幸存者），莎拉J的翅膀法院和毁灭。Maas（对于杂志），叛徒的吻（侵犯了Mulan的故事），以及Maggie Stiefvater的所有弯曲的圣徒（在出版犯罪犯罪的特殊例子中，人们已经决定以前的STIEVVATER的书是种族主义者她甚至已经完成了稿件。）</p><p>  But in an interesting twist, the teens who make up the community’s core audience are getting fed up with the constant, largely adult-driven dramas that currently dominate YA. Some have taken to discussing books via backchannels or on teen-exclusive hashtags — or defecting to other platforms, like YouTube or Instagram, which aren’t so given over to mob dynamics. But others are pushing back: Sierra Elmore, a college student and book blogger, expressed her frustration in a  tweet thread in January, writing, “[Being] in this community feels like being in high school again. So much. No difference of opinion allowed, people reigning, etc… I and other peop</p><p>  但是，在一个有趣的扭曲中，构成社区核心观众的青少年正在厌倦了当前主导ya的常量，主要是成人驱动的戏剧。有些人已经通过背信区或青少年独家哈希特 - 或缺陷到其他平台，如youtube或Instagram等，这是尤为restube或Instagram的讨论，这些平台并没有给予暴力动态。但其他人正在推迟：大学生和书籍博客塞尔莫尔在1月份的推文线程中表达了她的挫败感，写作，“在这个社区中的”[成为]再次在高中感觉就像在高中一样。非常。没有意见差异，人们统治等......我和其他培养 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-toxic-drama-of-ya-twitter.html">https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/the-toxic-drama-of-ya-twitter.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ya/">#ya</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/drama/">#drama</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/书籍/">#书籍</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
