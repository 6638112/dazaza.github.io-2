Gradually Yakov finds that his double has stolen his friends and replaced him at work, and that he is generally doing a much better job of being Yakov than Yakov ever could. When Yakov attempts to reclaim his life he can never get past the problem that people prefer the replicant to the real thing. The novel ends when Yakov’s friends have him sectioned, leaving his impersonator to become the real Yakov and be brilliant at it.</p><p>D​  《双面人》讲述了亚科夫·戈利亚德金的故事，他的生活被一个看起来和他一模一样但更迷人、更讨人喜欢的人毁掉了。渐渐地，雅科夫发现他的替身偷走了他的朋友，并在工作中取代了他，他做雅科夫的工作通常比雅科夫做得更好。当雅科夫试图夺回自己的生命时，他永远无法克服人们更喜欢复制品而不是真品的问题。小说结束时，雅科夫的朋友们把他分割了，让他的模仿者成为真正的雅科夫，并在这方面表现出色。</p><p> A few months ago a poet contacted me to ask if my Instagram account had been hacked. This was surprising because I didn’t think that I had an Instagram account. But when I looked online I discovered that I did and I was really quite popular. Someone had taken all the underwhelming posts from my Twitter profile – about how sea cucumbers eject their internal organs when under threat, about how Gary Oldman and George Saunders share the same face – and reposted them to enormous success. My replicant had more than six thousand followers after only four months. If fake me continued at this rate then he would quickly become more popular than real me, and – since popularity is now the only true measure of legitimacy – I would, at that moment, become my own impersonator. So I joined Instagram and sent fake me a message asking him (I thought of him as a him) to stop – after which he quickly blocked me. Then I asked my friends to make contact on my behalf. The confrontational comments they left on fake me’s profile were immediately flagged as abusive and removed. When I reported the problem directly to Instagram – filling in their online form, sending a photo of me holding my passport – I had to admire the brazenness of the disclaimer that came up as I clicked ‘send’: ‘We’re trying hard to prioritise reviews for the most urgent cases. This means we may be unable to review your ID or it may take a long time.’ In other words:  you’re almost certainly not important enough.</p><p>几个月前，一位诗人联系我，问我的Instagram账户是否遭到黑客攻击。这令人惊讶，因为我认为我没有Instagram账户。但当我在网上看的时候，我发现我是这样做的，我真的很受欢迎。有人从我的Twitter个人资料中获取了所有令人不快的帖子——关于海参在受到威胁时如何弹出内脏，关于加里·奥尔德曼和乔治·桑德斯如何拥有同一张脸——并将它们转发到了巨大的成功。仅仅四个月后，我的复制人就有了6000多名粉丝。如果“假我”继续以这种速度发展下去，那么他很快就会比“真我”更受欢迎，而且——既然受欢迎程度现在是衡量合法性的唯一真正标准——在那一刻，我会成为自己的模仿者。所以我加入了Instagram，给我发了一条假消息，要求他（我认为他是一个“他”）停下来——之后他很快就阻止了我。然后我请我的朋友代表我联系。他们在fake me的个人资料上留下的对抗性评论立即被标记为辱骂并删除。当我直接向Instagram报告这个问题时——填写他们的在线表格，发送一张我拿着护照的照片——我不得不钦佩我点击“发送”时出现的声明的厚颜无耻：“我们正在努力为最紧急的案件优先审查。”。这意味着我们可能无法查看您的ID，或者可能需要很长时间。”换句话说：你几乎肯定不够重要。</p><p> Having not heard back from Instagram, I eventually decided to set up a new account, a fake one under the name Joanna, and sent myself a private message.</p><p>由于没有收到Instagram的回复，我最终决定建立一个新帐户，一个名为乔安娜的假帐户，并给自己发了一条私人信息。</p><p> ‘Hello,’ I said. ‘I’ve read everything you’ve written, even the unpublished stuff.’</p><p>“你好，”我说你写的所有东西我都读过了，甚至是未发表的东西。”</p><p> ‘Wow I really appreciate you,’ he replied. ‘I wanna use this medium to get up close and personal with a Lucky Fan. Where are you located?’</p><p>“哇，我真的很感激你，”他回答道我想用这个媒介和一个幸运的粉丝近距离接触。你在哪里？”</p><p> ‘I live half the time in London, half the time in New York,’ I wrote, remaining vague yet glamorous.</p><p>“我一半的时间住在伦敦，一半的时间住在纽约，”我写道，虽然含糊其辞，但依然魅力四射。</p><p> ‘You seem to be a very nice person,’ he said. ‘Are you single? If yes, here is my private cell [it was an American number], drop me a message and I will get back to you asap. Baby please don’t share my number with anyone. Kisses and Hugs for you … Am having a studio session right now kindly text me, I will get back to you asap. Once again thanks for being a fan.’</p><p>“你看起来是个很好的人，”他说你是单身吗？如果是的，这是我的私人手机（这是一个美国号码），请给我留言，我会尽快回复你。宝贝，请不要和任何人分享我的号码。为你亲吻和拥抱…我正在录音室开会，请发短信给我，我会尽快回复你。再次感谢你的粉丝</p><p> Real me and fake me seemed to have an instant sexual chemistry. I thought about texting but then I got worried because that would mean sharing my actual phone number. So I ordered a new sim card – ‘my burner’, as I made a point of calling it – then bought a little black box from a man called Igor on the internet that would allow me secretly to record both sides of a phone conversation. Only then did I send my impersonator a message on WhatsApp: ‘I’m sorry I didn’t text you straight away. I was nervous!’ and then ‘Shall we chat? Are you in the studio?’ (I loved the idea that I had a studio.) I got no reply. I noticed that his WhatsApp profile picture was different from his Instagram. There it was one of my author photos but here it was a spooky hooded figure sitting in front of a laptop, face obscured by a question mark, looking halfway between a hacker and the Grim Reaper.</p><p>真我和假我似乎有一种即时的性化学反应。我想发短信，但后来我开始担心，因为那意味着要分享我的实际电话号码。因此，我订购了一张新的sim卡——“我的烧录机”，我特意给它打了个电话——然后在互联网上从一个名叫Igor的人那里买了一个小黑匣子，让我可以秘密地记录电话交谈的双方。直到那时，我才在WhatsApp上给我的模仿者发了一条信息：“对不起，我没有马上给你发短信。”。我很紧张！”然后“我们聊聊好吗？”？你在演播室吗？”（我喜欢我有一个工作室的想法。）我没有得到答复。我注意到他的WhatsApp个人资料图片与Instagram不一样。这是我的一张作者照片，但这是一个戴着兜帽的幽灵，坐在一台笔记本电脑前，脸上被一个问号遮住，看起来介于黑客和死神之间。</p><p> I waited all day for a reply and then, during my son’s bathtime, my phone rang. It was a video call from fake me. I watched the hooded figure glowing on my screen. With sudsy fingers, I answered and quickly angled the phone towards the ceiling in order to hide myself. Peering at the screen, I saw that he had switched off his camera. There was a long moment when neither of us said anything on account of not looking or sounding like the people we were pretending to be. The impersonator had a view of my bathroom’s recessed downlight and swirls of condensation, could hear a toddler bashing a toy duck against the tiles. I watched the blank screen and listened to the faint sound of someone exhaling. We were strangers in the dark, breathing on each other. Then, once fake me had established that I was probably not who I said I was, he hung up and blocked me.</p><p>我等了一整天的回复，然后，在儿子洗澡的时候，我的电话响了。那是假我的视频通话。我看着戴着兜帽的人在我的屏幕上闪闪发光。我用起泡的手指接了电话，迅速将手机朝天花板倾斜，以便躲藏起来。我看了看屏幕，发现他关掉了相机。有很长一段时间，我们两人都没有说任何话，因为他们看起来或听起来都不像我们假装的人。模拟者看到了我浴室的嵌入式筒灯和漩涡状的冷凝水，可以听到一个蹒跚学步的孩子用玩具鸭撞瓷砖的声音。我看着空白的屏幕，听着有人呼出的微弱声音。我们在黑暗中是陌生人，彼此呼吸。然后，一旦假我确定我可能不是我所说的那个人，他就挂断电话阻止了我。</p><p> I took reassurance from the fact that this sort of thing happens all the time. Jonathan Franzen is impersonated so often he has saved on his desktop a picture of himself holding a sign that says ‘I’m not on Twitter.’ He periodically emails this to the relevant authorities who, presumably, take prompt action. Which is all very well if you’re Jonathan Franzen. But the genius of impersonating someone like me is that I’m the only one who cares.</p><p>这种事情一直都在发生，这让我感到放心。乔纳森·弗兰森（Jonathan Franzen）经常被模仿，他在自己的桌面上保存了一张自己拿着一块牌子的照片，上面写着“我不在Twitter上”他定期向相关部门发送电子邮件，据推测，相关部门会立即采取行动。如果你是Jonathan Franzen就很好了。但模仿像我这样的人的天才在于我是唯一在乎的人。</p><p> I still hadn’t heard back from Instagram so I sent them another complaint, angrier this time, typing with a great noisy clacking of the keyboard, warning that the longer they took to act, the more they put their users at risk. This wasn’t about me, I wrote, except, implicitly, in all the ways that it was about me. I slapped the send button and a warning box immediately popped up that said: ‘Facebook’s systems determined that you were going too fast when taking an action. You must significantly slow down. You are engaging in behaviour that may be considered annoying or abusive by other users.’ So now  I was the troll? Me, with my burner, my bugging device, my fake account and my self-righteous mission? It was an outrage.</p><p>我还没有收到Instagram的回复，所以我又给他们发了一封投诉信，这次更生气了，键盘发出了巨大的咔哒声，警告他们采取行动的时间越长，就越会让用户面临风险。我写道，这与我无关，只是在所有方面都与我有关。我按了一下发送按钮，立刻弹出一个警告框，上面写着：“Facebook的系统确定你在采取行动时速度太快了。”。你必须大大放慢速度。你的行为可能会被其他用户视为恼人或虐待。”所以现在我成了巨魔？我，我的燃烧器，我的窃听设备，我的假账户和我自以为是的使命？这是一种愤怒。</p><p> The advice from my publishers was just to move on. It was not worth the effort required to get these kinds of account taken down. But I was already in too deep. I started up another, different, fake Instagram account and, again, began the humiliating rigmarole of trying to seduce myself. We started messaging and eventually fake me said that he wanted to get ‘up close and personal’ though this time I wasn’t given a phone number. I said that I would pay him to help me with my poems, hoping that he might then send me his bank details and give something away. I should have guessed that he’d want to be paid in bitcoin. He also said that, before he would look at my poems, I would have to ‘sign a contract, a police affidavit and a non-disclosure agreement form so that we will know that all this is legal’. His sudden commitment to legality was, in the circumstances, quite endearing. I created some poems using an online haiku generator and sent them to his email address, joedunthorne39@yahoo.com. Then, while I waited for all the documentation to come through, we began chatting.</p><p>我的出版商建议我继续前进。不值得花那么多精力去考虑这些问题。但我已经陷得太深了。我创建了另一个不同的假Instagram账户，再次开始了试图诱惑自己的羞辱性的繁文缛节。我们开始发短信，最后假装我说他想“近距离接触”但这次没有给我电话号码。我说我会付钱给他，让他帮我写诗歌，希望他能把银行的详细资料寄给我，并给我一些东西。我应该猜到他想用比特币支付。他还说，在他看我的诗之前，我必须“签署一份合同、一份警方宣誓书和一份保密协议表格，以便我们知道所有这些都是合法的”。在这种情况下，他对合法性的突然承诺相当可爱。我用一个在线俳句生成器创作了一些诗歌，并将它们发送到他的电子邮件地址，joedunthorne39@yahoo.com.然后，在我等待所有文件通过的时候，我们开始聊天。</p><p> Fake me was in Florida on holiday, sunbathing and going to Universal Studios. His favourite film was  Fast and Furious 9 and he hoped that it wouldn’t be the last in the franchise. He liked listening to country music, old-school hip hop and R’n’B. These answers came quickly and I had a strong feeling that this person was not overthinking their replies. He wasn’t in character. In which case it seemed highly likely that I was speaking to an actual person who was probably in Florida, probably a young man, perhaps on holiday, perhaps at dinner with his parents who, at this moment, were watching the frightening fluency of his thumbs on the screen, his face blue-lit by the glare, wondering what could be so interesting that it could steal their little boy away from them.</p><p>假我在佛罗里达度假，晒日光浴，去环球影城。他最喜欢的电影是《快速狂暴9》，他希望这不会是这部系列电影中的最后一部。他喜欢听乡村音乐、老派嘻哈和节奏布鲁斯。这些答案来得很快，我有一种强烈的感觉，这个人没有过度思考他们的回答。他性格不好。在这种情况下，我很可能是在跟一个可能在佛罗里达的真实的人说话，可能是一个年轻人，可能是在度假，可能是在和他的父母共进晚餐。此时，他的父母正在屏幕上看着他的拇指令人恐惧地流畅，他的脸被强光照亮，想知道什么会如此有趣，以至于它能把他们的小男孩从他们身边偷走。</p><p> I never heard back about my poems because fake me had bigger plans. On Instagram he posted a message encouraging his (our?) fans to buy my new book. This seemed like a great bit of free publicity until he also, and more emphatically, encouraged them to invest in cryptocurrency. Here was the endgame. He updated his profile so that it said: ‘Writer of novels and poems. Crypto lover.’ He recommended a particular investment expert, Tyler, a friend of his who, it turned out, was himself an impersonation of a well-known crypto analyst.</p><p>我从来没有听说过我的诗，因为我有更大的计划。在Instagram上，他发布了一条鼓励他（我们的？）的消息粉丝们想买我的新书。这似乎是一个很大的免费宣传，直到他也，更强调地，鼓励他们投资加密货币。这就是结局。他更新了个人资料，上面写着：“小说和诗歌的作者。”。加密爱好者。”他推荐了一位特别的投资专家泰勒，泰勒是他的一位朋友，事实证明，泰勒本人是一位著名密码分析师的仿制品。</p><p> Using one of my fake accounts, I started talking to fake Tyler, who promised to help me ‘make millions’ if I would only ‘jump into this unlimited opportunity’. We chatted on and off for a week, with me trying to uncover his deeper psychology and him trying to convince me to put money into a company called Metaco – and neither of us getting anywhere. I learned that Metaco was also fake, an imitation of a legitimate investment company. While the real Metaco was based in Switzerland, the fake one had an address in northern Romania – the picturesque medieval city of Suceava – though their website was registered in the Cocos Islands, a largely uninhabited tropical archipelago in the Indian Ocean. In other words, there seemed to be an international network of fakery built on the expectation that people were going to take financial advice from a poet-novelist.</p><p>利用我的一个假账户，我开始与假泰勒交谈，他承诺只要我“跳进这个无限的机会”，就能帮我“赚几百万”。我们断断续续地聊了一个星期，我试图揭示他更深层次的心理，他试图说服我把钱投到一家叫做Metaco的公司——我们两人都一事无成。我得知Metaco也是假的，是一家合法投资公司的仿制品。虽然真正的Metaco总部位于瑞士，但假的Metaco的地址位于罗马尼亚北部——风景如画的中世纪城市苏切瓦——尽管他们的网站注册在科科斯群岛，这是印度洋上一个基本无人居住的热带群岛。换句话说，似乎有一个国际造假网络建立在人们会接受诗人小说家的财务建议的期望之上。</p><p> We are living through a golden age of online scams. In 2021, people in the US lost more than $3.5 billion to various internet hoaxes, many of which are highly complex and, at the same time, flamboyantly stupid. There was the one where people invested $3.3 million in SQUID, a cryptocurrency that promised its buyers it would be tradable in a video game inspired by the Netflix show  Squid Game. The value of the coin rose 86,000 per cent in less than a week – which would have made a lot of people incredibly rich, if the whole thing had not been a fiction. Then there was the one where scammers tricked people into investing $2.7 million in cartoons of apes. In fact, this was a double scam, convincing buyers first that the images were timeless works of digital art and then that they should pay huge amounts of money to an organisation that didn’t exist. If these schemes worked, then it raised the question of whether my impersonator was in fact an evil genius, creaming millions from my devoted fanbase – which, in a sad sort of way, would have been quite gratifying.</p><p>我们正经历一个网络诈骗的黄金时代。在2021，美国的人损失了超过35亿美元的各种网络恶作剧，其中很多都是高度复杂的，同时又是炫耀性的愚蠢。有一次，人们在SQUID上投资了330万美元。SQUID是一种加密货币，向买家承诺，它将在一款受Netflix show SQUID游戏启发的电子游戏中进行交易。这枚硬币的价值在不到一周的时间里上涨了8.6万%——如果整件事不是虚构的话，这会让很多人变得异常富有。还有一次，骗子骗人们投资270万美元制作猿类漫画。事实上，这是一个双重骗局，首先让买家相信这些图像是永恒的数字艺术作品，然后他们应该向一个不存在的组织支付巨额资金。如果这些计划奏效，那么它就提出了一个问题：我的模仿者是否真的是一个邪恶的天才，从我忠实的粉丝群中榨取了数百万人——以一种悲哀的方式，这将是相当令人欣慰的。</p><p> I can only assume that fake me wasn’t making a lot of money because one day he discarded me. He changed his name and profile picture so that he was now a dashing young crypto analyst called Koroush whose videos showed him doing one-handed pull-ups in the garden of his enormous, glassy house while balancing a MacBook in the palm of his other hand. I admit to feeling a little hurt. The strange thing was that my poems were still there, layered beneath the new posts about learning Brazilian jiujitsu and smoking shisha in Dubai, creating the odd sense that I had been upgraded: a poet with a portfolio and core strength.</p><p>我只能假设假我没赚多少钱，因为有一天他抛弃了我。他改变了自己的名字和个人资料图片，因此他现在是一位名叫Koroush的年轻精力充沛的密码分析师，他的视频显示他在自己巨大的玻璃房子的花园里做单手引体向上，同时用另一只手平衡一台MacBook。我承认有点受伤。奇怪的是，我的诗仍在那里，层叠在关于学习巴西柔术和在迪拜抽什刹的新帖子下面，这让我产生了一种奇怪的感觉：我是一个拥有投资组合和核心实力的诗人。</p><p> A few weeks later I saw that fake me had changed his face and name again and was now Diego, a 21-year-old Spanish crypto-millionaire, and then he changed again, becoming a ferociously upbeat market analyst and YouTuber called Donovan, and then it happened again. On and on he went, shifting shape every month or so, but always with my poems buried inside him. By the time I tried to make contact again – now using the crypto-friendly name of Yakov Golyadkin – he had switched his account to private and wouldn’t grant me access. I was locked out of myself.</p><p>几周后，我看到“假我”再次改变了他的面孔和名字，现在是21岁的西班牙加密百万富翁迭戈，然后他又变了，成为一名极其乐观的市场分析师和YouTube名为多诺万，然后事情又发生了。他不停地走着，每个月左右都会变形，但总是把我的诗埋在他心里。当我再次尝试联系时——现在使用的是雅科夫·戈利亚德金这个加密友好的名字——他已经把自己的账户改成了私人账户，不允许我访问。我被锁在外面。</p><p> That left me alone to pick over the meaning of our earlier conversations. If it had always been about cryptocurrency, then why had he wanted to get up close and personal with a Lucky Fan? I began to speak to all the people who had been in contact with fake me. It slowly became clear that I was the only one to whom my impersonator had actually given his phone number. It took me a few days to accept the unavoidable conclusion: fake me was only interested because real me was so keen.</p><p>这让我独自去理解我们之前谈话的意义。如果一直都是关于加密货币的，那么他为什么要和一个幸运的粉丝近距离接触呢？我开始与所有与我有过接触的人交谈。慢慢地，我才明白，我的模仿者是唯一一个真正把电话号码给我的人。我花了几天时间才接受了一个不可避免的结论：假的我之所以感兴趣，是因为真我如此热衷。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/real/">#real</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/可能/">#可能</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
