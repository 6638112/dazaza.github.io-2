"note_en": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may have  struggled with LAANC authorization, but they moved ahead with releasing TRUST (The Recreational UAS Safety Test) \u2013 a free online training program that pilots flying a drone recreationally are required to take and pass. Even if someone possesses Part 107 certification, they must complete this training and show proof of it, if asked by the FAA or law enforcement, in order to legally operate a drone, if they&#39;re flying recreationally, in the United States.\n Mandated by the FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018, drone industry stakeholders helped develop the curriculum for remote pilots. The FAA recently designated 16 non-governmental organizations to administer the test. They are:\n  &#39;This is a great step in the right direction to help educate recreational pilots. TRUST strikes a nice balance between education without being too hard. We\u2019re excited to partner with the FAA to provide the test for free to the UAS community,&#39; Greg Reverdiau, of Pilot Institute, tells  DPReview. Links to all the testing hubs, mentioned above, can be found on  the FAA&#39;s website.\n The entire testing process is expected to take roughly 30 minutes, at most, to complete. It requires reading some text and taking four quizzes. Once you&#39;ve passed, you&#39;ll receive a Certificate of Completion that can be printed out. The certificate does not expire.\n       Greg Ohio   This would be harmless except for one thing: the requirement to show your certificate to law enforcement on demand.\n In most states, police cannot demand ID without a legitimate reason. But, under this regulation, you&#39;re violating federal law of you don&#39;t provide it to police upon demand, whether that demand conforms to state law or not.\n lilBuddha   Typical government that one needs to take the light version of a test one has already passed.\n alexgannis   So I though registering your drone was proof for legally flying now you have to take a test ? FAA should refund my five dollars I paid to registered my drone.\n Greg Ohio   It looks like the FAA granted Community Based Organizations the power to created additional rules.\n Ed Ingold   Official FAA postings specifically reject that idea. Participating community organizations cannot impose additional rules, apart from administrative details. Some require registration, others are anonymous. They have no special influence on content.\n  JLee001   If you already have your Part 107 consider the TRUST exam a super light version of the test. You will easily be able to answer the questions. Each section of the exam is very easy to read and understand even if you don&#39;t have your Part 107. Questions are pulled directly from each reading section and not overly complicated or tricky. Passed with ease. 100%.\n Quetal   I am buying a recreational drone. I haven\u2019t decided which. So, I did not know one needed a certificate. What is 107?  Am I to presume if I go to a hobby shop and drop a few hundred I need permission to fly it? Thanks for any insight info  Henry\n Ed Ingold   TRUST consists of basic drone safety rules, similar to that published in many official and NGO forums to date.\n Part 107 certification is essentially the same as required for student pilots before flight training. It is required before a drone pilot can engage in any commercial activity. It includes aero map reading, weather as it affects flying, and procedures which must be followed prior to and during flight activities.\n Ken Seals   It&#39;s not above and beyond 107. It&#39;s just the basics for recreational flyers (non 107).\n charles lee   Just went through the course and test... it was relatively painless... took about 30 minutes and didn&#39;t cost anything.\n You get a printable certificate at the end. I also saved it as a PDF file (both to phone and computer) for future printing if needed (the FAA doesn&#39;t keep track of these, so if you loose it, you&#39;ll need to re-take the course).\n girlperson1   I too just took the course and test and ACED it. Mostly common sense stuff.\n overzeetop   &#34;Even if someone possesses Part 107 certification, they must complete this training and show proof of it&#34;\n Do you have a link to that interpretation? Like, if I *might not* use a photo I took while flying my registered drone, is that considered flying recreationally. Does the FAA official wanting to see my TRUST certificate make a judgement call about the commercial viability of my photos or flight pattern which invalidates the Part 107 License I carry with me?\n Ed Ingold   The FAA website is quite clear about the limitations on recreational flight. There can be no direct or indirect financial benefit derived from the flight. You cannot volunteer your services for purposes such as inspection or real estate sales.\n overzeetop   @Ed - the implication is that if you hold a Part 107 commercial license (I do) and get &#34;caught&#34; flying purely recreationally (i.e. there is no clear commercial or potentially commercial purpose), you can be cited for illegal operation of the drone.\n I think I&#39;ll just look like I&#39;m in a bad mood if I take the drone to the park, that way I can claim I wasn&#39;t having fun and my operation clearly wasn&#39;t recreational in any way.\n Kara Murphy   There was a discussion about this in the drone forums and some people suggested saying that you\u2019re flying Part 107. That being said, a lot of people took this today as it\u2019s quick and easy to pass.\n RedFox88   You can\u2019t just say you are Part 107 certified and not have the credentials to back it up if questioned \ud83d\ude44\n  If you&#39;re looking for a high-quality camera, you don&#39;t need to spend a ton of cash, nor do you need to buy the latest and greatest new product on the market.

Without it, the instruments on board meant to snap pictures and collect data are not currently working.\n  Scientists have run a series of tests on the malfunctioning computer system but have yet to figure out what went wrong.\n  &#34;It&#39;s just the inefficiency of trying to fix something which is orbiting 400 miles over your head instead of in your laboratory,&#34; Paul Hertz, the director of astrophysics for NASA, told NPR.\n  &#34;If this computer were in the lab, we&#39;d be hooking up monitors and testing the inputs and outputs all over the place, and would be really quick to diagnose it,&#34; he said. &#34;All we can do is send a command from our limited set of commands and then see what data comes out of the computer and then send that data down and try to analyze it.&#34;\n      At first NASA scientists wondered if a &#34;degrading memory module&#34; on Hubble was to blame. Then on Tuesday  the agency said it was investigating whether the computer&#39;s Central Processing Module (CPM) or its Standard Interface (STINT) hardware, which helps the CPM communicate with other components, caused the problem.\n  Hertz said the current assumption, though unverified, was that the technical issue was a &#34;random parts failure&#34; somewhere on the computer system, which was built in the 1980s and launched into space in 1990.\n     &#34;They&#39;re very primitive computers compared to what&#39;s in your cell phone,&#34; he said, &#34;but the problem is we can&#39;t touch it or see it.&#34;\n  Most of Hubble&#39;s components have redundant back-ups, so once scientists figure out the specific component that&#39;s causing the computer problem, they can remotely switch over to its back-up part.\n  &#34;The rule of thumb is when something is working you don&#39;t change it,&#34; Hertz said. &#34;We&#39;d like to change as few things as possible when we bring Hubble back into service.&#34;\n    The  instruments that the payload computer operates \u2014 such as the Advanced Camera for Surveys that captures images of space and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph which measures distant sources of ultraviolet light \u2014 are currently in &#34;safe mode&#34; and not operating.\n    The telescope itself, which runs on a different system, has continued to operate by pointing at different parts of the sky on a set schedule. &#34;The reason we do that is so that the telescope keeps changing its orientation relative to the sun in the way that we had planned, and that maintains the thermal stability of the telescope, keeps it at the right temperature,&#34; Hertz said.\n  The last time astronauts visited Hubble was in 2009 for its  fifth and final servicing mission.\n  Hertz said that because Hubble was designed to be serviced by the space shuttle and the space shuttle fleet has since been retired, there are no future plans to service the outer space observatory.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:16:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40,nasa,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a,figure", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u5728\u54c8\u52c3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u4e0a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u95ee\u9898 ", "title_en": "NASA Can't Figure Out What's Causing Computer Issues on the Hubble Telescope", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/06/23/1009567351/hubble-trouble-nasa-cant-figure-out-whats-causing-computer-issues-on-the-telesco", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40", "nasa", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a", "figure"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2881028ca38bb15867c472c783f51de4.webp", "infoid": 1067980, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4efb\u4f55PHP\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u53d1\u9001API\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u70b9\u70b9\u624b\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2aSDK\u6216\u5305\u88c5\u5668 - \u4f46\u60a8\u4ecd\u7136\u5fc5\u987b\u505a\u540c\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\n \u60a8\u5728HTTP\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6216Facade\u4e2d\u62c9\u52a8\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5176\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u8fdb\u5165\u8981\u53d1\u9001\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684URI\u7684\u8fd0\u7b97\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u9644\u4ef6\uff0c\u5982\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u624b\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n \u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u5019\u60a8\u90fd\u6709\u8981\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5165\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7b49\u65f6\u7565\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u4e1c\u897f - \u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5b83\u4eec\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e38\u91cf\u3002\n \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u611f\u5230\u6cae\u4e27\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u5236\u9020\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u5411\u7684\u5f88\u591a\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7528API\u8bf7\u6c42\u5b8c\u6210\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u5750\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5f88\u957f\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u601d\u8003\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848 - \u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u6700\u65b0\u7684Laravel\u5305\u88c5\uff1a\u6211\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\uff1a\n Transporter\u662f\u5728PHP\u4e2d\u53d1\u9001API\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u672a\u6765\u6d3e\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u5904\u7406API\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684OOP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u8981\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u505a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u914d\u7f6e\u65e0\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e1c\u897f - \u5b83\u53ea\u5728\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002 \n\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u6240\u505a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u6258\u591a\u5217\u8868 - \u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u601d\u662f\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u3002\n \u9996\u5148\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff08\u4f46\u662f\u5047\u88c5\u6211\u4eec\u5047\u88c5\u6b64API\u8981\u6c42\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684API\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\u3002\n  \u4e0d\u53ef\u601d\u8bae\u7684\u6743\u5229\uff1f\u6211\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u671f\u671b\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6210\u7ee9\u3002\u5982\u679cURL\u66f4\u6539\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5982\u679c\u67e5\u8be2\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u6211\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u8ffd\u6355\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u3002\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u907f\u514d\u66f4\u591a\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u6211\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002\n \u8ba9\uff06\uff0339;

It is quite a manual process.\n A lot of the time you have a specific request you want to send, yes you may slightly adjust things as you go by passing in an identifier etc etc - but in general they remain relatively constant.\n This has frustrated me for a while, we have to great lengths to make a lot of our code Object Oriented. Yet, we hadn&#39;t tried to do this with API requests. I have been sitting on this question for quite a while, pondering on the possible solutions - how it might look, and how it might be used.\n The result of this has turned into my latest Laravel package:  Laravel Transporter which I describe as:\n Transporter is a futuristic way to send API requests in PHP. This is an OOP approach to handle API requests.\n  To get started all you need to do is install it, theres no configuration required nothing extra to add to your project - it will only be used when you want to use it.\n   All we are doing here is filtering a list of todos that are completed - nothing overly difficult.\n Firstly let us have a look at how we would do this usually (but let&#39;s pretend this API required us to be authenticated using an API token we have previously generated).\n  Not terrible right? I mean, it works and does what you might expect. But, this is very proceedural. What happens if the URL changes? What happens if the query parameters change? We have to hunt through our code base, and update these everywhere. You know, the thing we are trying to avoid more and more in everything we build.\n Let&#39;s add a little magic to these requests and see how we would send this exact same request using Laravel Transporter:\n  That&#39;s it. The entire thing condensed into a class. Let&#39;s look how we got there.\n    &lt;?phpdeclare(strict_types=1);namespace App\\Transporter;use Illuminate\\Http\\Client\\PendingRequest;use JustSteveKing\\Transporter\\Request;class TodoRequest extends Request{ protected string $method = &#39;GET&#39;; protected string $baseUrl = &#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com&#39;; protected string $path = &#39;/todos&#39;; protected array $data = [ &#39;completed&#39; =&gt; true, ]; protected function withRequest(PendingRequest $request): void { $request-&gt;withToken(config(&#39;jsonplaceholder.api.token&#39;)); }}\n Going back to the original problem, if options change - we have to hunt everywhere in our application for where we may have used it. That problem has been solved by moving this to a class based request. Also, as the request itself is just a fancy wrapper around Laravels inbuilt  PendingRequest - we can call all the same methods before and after sending. Meaning there is no new API to learn, so it is relatively straight forward. You can override options at runtime too - want to show not completed todos?\n  This may not be a ground breaking package that is going to change the world, however what it is going to do is make you start asking the question: Could I send API requests in a more structured and organised way?\n Imagine a scenario, where you needed to work with a 3rd party API. You could quite quickly generate a series of requests and it will be done! Let&#39;s take the example of Laravel Forge, which if you remember I wrote about before when I released PHP-SDK  here is that article.\n    &lt;?phpdeclare(strict_types=1);namespace App\\Transporter\\Forge;use Illuminate\\Http\\Client\\PendingRequest;use JustSteveKing\\Transporter\\Request;class ForgeRequest extends Request{ protected string $baseUrl = &#39;https://forge.laravel.com/api/v1&#39;; protected function withRequest(PendingRequest $request): void { $request-&gt;withToken(config(&#39;services.forge.token&#39;)); }}\n Next let&#39;s take the example of getting all servers. Generate a new request for this request:\n   &lt;?phpdeclare(strict_types=1);namespace App\\Transporter\\Forge\\Servers;use App\\Transporter\\Forge\\ForgeRequest;use Illuminate\\Http\\Client\\PendingRequest;class ListServers extends ForgeRequest{ protected string $method = &#39;GET&#39;; protected string $path = &#39;/servers&#39;;}\n All we have done here is used inheritance to extend the ForgeRequest which contains our initial state for every request we need - and allows us to build upon that where we want to.\n Thanks for reading, I welcome any feedback that may assist in pushing this package forward and making it easier to use!

The group analyzed more than 9,200 complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2017 to April of 2021.\n The report found more than 2,700 complaints were made from January to April of this year \u2014 compared to just over 600 in the same period last year.\n   One of them is Luke Krafka, a professional cellist from Long Island,   New York. Krafka often plays in concerts with a changing cast of musicians, who are usually paid in cash \u2014 and he says mobile payment apps have made that task a lot easier.\n &#34;Paypal, Venmo, cash app, yeah. There&#39;s no paper involved, there&#39;s no checks involved, there&#39;s no waiting,&#34; he told CBS News Consumer Investigative Correspondent Anna Werner, &#34;You get paid right away, goes to your bank account.&#34;\n   &#34;It was gearing up to be a normal, you know, wedding. And I had reached out to my friends that are good for the gig,&#34; he said.\n The client told him he would send a check of roughly $1,000 for Krafka and another $950 to pay for the client&#39;s &#34;sound man&#34; \u2014 who he asked Krafka to then pay through a mobile payment app.\n &#34;I said, &#39;look, if you send me the money, that&#39;s no problem, that&#39;s fine,&#39;&#34; Krafka recalled.\n   Mobile payment apps allow users to pay others immediately, through   bank accounts or credit cards connected to the app.\n Their simplicity is usually a good thing, but not always, as Krafka found out after depositing the wedding client&#39;s check for $1,960.\n &#34;I checked the following day, and the full amount was in my bank account,&#34; he said.\n Then as requested, he sent the client&#39;s &#34;sound man&#34; $950 through the payment app Zelle.\n &#34;I believe it was the following day that check bounced,&#34; he said. &#34;And when that happened, then I slowly started to put all of this together.&#34;\n The people who supposedly hired him stopped answering his calls \u2014 and he was out the $950.\n    PIRG&#39;s report looked at over 9,000 complaints to federal regulators about digital wallets and payment apps, including PayPal, Venmo, CashApp and Zelle.\n They found the ones filed between January and April of this year were up more than 300% from the same period last year \u2014 with many losing money to scams or fraud.\n &#34;If it&#39;s a scammer, it is not coming back,&#34; said Ed Mierzwinski, who oversees PIRG&#39;s Federal Consumer Program.\n  &#34;There are no rules that protect you very well at all when your money goes out of your account and into somebody else&#39;s account,&#34; he said.\n  Krafka said he reached out to his bank to get the money back, but was told they couldn&#39;t help him.\n   &#34;I was surprised that there was no recourse and that once it&#39;s done, it&#39;s done and there&#39;s nothing you can do,&#34; the professional musician said.\n Zelle would not comment on Krafka&#39;s case, but said its top priority is &#34;protecting consumers from scams and fraud.&#34; The company provides a  comprehensive list of recommendations on its website for consumers to protect themselves.\n Cash App has a help center for consumers online and on their mobile app as well as a 7-day  customer service phone number, and encourages people, &#34;If you believe you have fallen victim to a scam, you should contact Cash App Support through the app or website immediately.&#34; They also provide articles on  recognizing and avoiding scams on their site.\n Venmo and Paypal urge consumers who think they&#39;ve  fallen victim to a scam to &#34;contact Customer Support directly.&#34; They provide resources for what to look out for and how to report it  on their website.\n &#34;We also recommend that customers contact\u00a0 spoof@paypal.com\u00a0to share information on suspected spam.

The disease can affect the kidneys, lungs, heart, and crucially,  brain function. As many as  80 percent of people hospitalized with Covid-19 report neurological issues like seizure disorders, brain fog, and depression. These conditions can persist long after the virus has cleared the body as symptoms of \u201c long Covid.\u201d\n Despite the staggeringly high percentage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with neurological conditions, what exactly goes on in the brain during this brutal process has been less clear.\n How the discovery was made \u2014 Researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine and Saarland University in Germany examined the brain tissue of eight people who died of Covid-19 and compared this tissue to the brains of 14 controls.\n Despite the fact that none of the patients reported clinical signs of neurological impairment prior to their death, the researchers  found \u201cprofound molecular markers of inflammation\u201d in the patients\u2019 brain tissue. Their  findings were published Monday in the journal  Nature.\n These markers were so profound, the study team reports they\u2019re akin to what you\u2019d expect to see in the brains of people who died of neurodegenerative diseases like  Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and  Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Bafflingly, the researchers did not find any evidence of  the virus itself in the brain.\n  Whether or not SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, becomes or remains present in the brains of people who become infected is a debated issue in the scientific and medical community. Some studies, like this 2020  pre-print paper examining deceased patients, have found traces of the virus in the brain. Others, like this  2020 paper in which two patients with Covid-19 and neurological symptoms are examined, have not.\n Determining whether or not the virus is present in the brain is important because it can help researchers understand whether or not it is the virus itself \u2014 or the body\u2019s immune response to the virus \u2014 that is causing the damage. This understanding is critical for making the best decision when it comes to treatment.\n  In an article published in  Nature in September 2020, Benedict Michael, a neurologist at the University of Liverpool,  explained the importance of finding the mechanism by which these neurological conditions develop.\n \u201cIf this is direct viral infection of the central nervous system, these are the patients we should be targeting for remdesivir or another antiviral,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas if the virus is not in the central nervous system, maybe the virus is clear of the body, then we need to treat with anti-inflammatory therapies.\u201d\n What\u2019s new \u2014 Using \u201c single-cell RNA sequencing,\u201d the researchers behind this new study took 65,309 cells from brain tissue sampled from the deceased Covid-19 patients, as well as controls. They recorded the activation levels of thousands of genes in each cell.\n In every case, the activation levels of hundreds of genes in major cell types taken from Covid-19 patients were markedly different from the controls. Many of those genes are associated with inflammatory responses.\n Combined with the fact that the researchers couldn\u2019t find any evidence of the virus in the samples, this suggests it is the  immune response that is at least partially responsible for the neurological conditions.\n The researchers also found irregularities in the cerebral cortex; the area of the brain involved in  executive functioning like decision making and memory.\n In patients who died of Covid-19, samples taken from the outermost layers of the cerebral cortex showed molecular changes. These changes suggest alterations in brain signaling typically associated with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and other  neurodegenerative conditions.\n  The researchers found another clue that immune response may be responsible for some of the neurological effects associated with Covid-19:  T-cells.\n In the brains of deceased Covid-19 patients, T-cells were much more abundant than they were in the control brains. This makes sense: An abundance of T-cells is not something typically found in a healthy brain.\n The  Inverse analysis \u2014 Given that an  overactive immune response is known to be one of the causes of poor Covid-19 outcomes, it would make sense if that response extended to the brain, ultimately causing inflammatory changes.\n But more work needs to be done to find out precisely how the immune response causes these marked reactions as well as a better understanding of the virus\u2019 direct role, if any, on the brain.\n One of the most striking, and still unexplained, aspects of this study is how the Covid-19 patients \u2014 whose brains were so vastly and distinctively different from the controls \u2014 had no reported clinical neurological symptoms. With more than 179 million cases of Covid-19 worldwide, it is vitally important that we understand exactly what contracting this virus can do to our bodies.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:13:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5206\u5b50,similar,\u5927\u8111", "title": "Covid-19\u7684\u5927\u8111\uff1a\u5206\u5b50\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u76f8\u4f3c ", "title_en": "Brain on Covid-19: Molecular changes appear similar to Alzheimer's disease", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/this-is-your-brain-on-covid19", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5206\u5b50", "similar", "\u5927\u8111"]}]
