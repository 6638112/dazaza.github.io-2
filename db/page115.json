", "note_en": "YouTube said Monday that it had reinstated a channel run by Right Wing Watch that cataloged some of the most extreme statements of prominent conservatives, hours after the Google-owned video platform had banned the channel for violating its rules.\n &#34;Right Wing Watch&#39;s YouTube  channel was mistakenly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,&#34; the tech company said in a statement.\n  It attributed the mistake to the large volume of videos on its site. YouTube automates much of the content moderation for the more than 500 hours of content that it says are uploaded every minute, and it said it tries to act quickly when a channel is mistakenly removed.\n   Right Wing Watch is a project of People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group founded in 1981 and based in Washington, D.C. The project had been posting video clips from politicians, preachers and other figures for more than 10 years on YouTube, carving out an audience of about  47,000 subscribers.\n Earlier Monday, Right Wing Watch said it had received a notice of a permanent ban related to rules violations in the video clips that it posts, which often show examples of alleged hate speech, conspiracy theories and other prohibited content.\n The group said the ban was an ironic outcome of YouTube trying to enforce its rules, as the company targeted not just the original source of material such as conspiracy theories, but also those who seek to document it.\n &#34;Our efforts to expose the bigoted view and dangerous conspiracy theories spread by right-wing activists has now resulted in @YouTube\u00a0banning our channel and removing thousands of our videos,&#34; Right Wing Watch had said in a  statement  early Monday.\n  Some conservative activists had  delighted in the removal, noting in posts on Twitter that Right Wing Watch had often called on YouTube to ban them or their allies for rules violations. But others said the ban showed a troubling inability by YouTube to distinguish between creators of prohibited content and those countering it.\n  YouTube and Right Wing Watch have battled for years over the presence of extremist videos.\n In October, Right Wing Watch said that YouTube  removed one of its videos documenting content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory, but had left up the original YouTube channel where the group found the content.\u00a0It reported a similar  dynamic in April with content related to the 2020 presidential election.\n  Kyle Mantyla, a senior fellow at Right Wing Watch, said in an interview that the project got two &#34;strikes&#34; from YouTube in April for clips about election-related conspiracy theories. He said YouTube delivered a third and final &#34;strike&#34; earlier this month for an eight-year-old video of a religious broadcaster who was denouncing gays.\n  &#34;Their inability to differentiate between the people who are trying to advocate this stuff and those who are trying to document and counter it is at the heart of the problem here,&#34; he said.\n He said early Monday that, beginning in 2019, the group began switching to the rival service Vimeo as its video host.\n  &#34;Without the ability to accurately portray dangerous behavior, meaningful journalism and public education about that behavior would cease to exist,&#34; Right Wing Watch Director Adele Stan said\u00a0in a statement.\n  &#34;We hope this is the end of a years-long struggle with YouTube to understand the nature of our work,&#34; she said.\n Journalists and researchers have warned for years about social media networks inadvertently erasing evidence of extremism or violence as they try to rid their services of objectionable material. In a report last year, Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit group that investigates abuses worldwide,  warned that YouTube and other tech companies were failing to archive potential evidence of serious crimes including war crimes.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:41:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "youtube,\u6062\u590d,reinstates", "title": "YouTube\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u53f3\u7ffc\u624b\u8868 ", "title_en": "YouTube reinstates Right Wing Watch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/youtube-reinstates-channel-devoted-exposing-conservative-extremism-rcna1286", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "\u6062\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9895536060bdbda218c9640d64556e35.jpg", "infoid": 1068467, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6fc0\u5149\u6210\u4e3a\u6574\u4e2a\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u7c89\u4e1d\u5e2d\u5377\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u611f\u89c9\u597d\u50cf\u5c4f\u5e55\u5f00\u59cb\u6269\u5927\u3002\n \u6211\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u8001\u77f3\u5efa\u7b51......\u5c31\u50cf\u4e00\u5ea7\u57ce\u5821......\u6211\u5728\u5b83\u4e0a\u9762\u98de\u884c\u3002\n   \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u89c2\u770b\uff06\uff0334;

on their computers \u2013 an intense full-screen, red-and-black flicker  that anyone can access online and that we use in our experiments.\n In less than ten minutes, it creates altered states of  consciousness, with no lasting effects for the brain. Visual experiences set in almost as soon as you start looking at it.\n But our new study,  published in  Cortex, shows that while some people see castles or fractals in the Ganzflicker, others see nothing. We have come up with a theory of where those individual differences come from.\n Like a computer screen, the part of your brain that processes visual information (the visual cortex) has a refresh &#34;button&#34; which helps it sample the environment \u2013  taking snapshots of the world in quick succession.\n In other words, your brain collects sensory information with a certain frequency. Yet you see the world as continuous and dynamic, thanks to your brain&#39;s sophisticated ability to fill in the blanks.\n For example, your eyes have a blind spot right outside the center of vision, but you don&#39;t see a patch of blackness everywhere you look. Your visual cortex extrapolates from the surrounding visual information so that your whole field of view  appears to be complete. If the sensory information being processed is the Ganzflicker, this will interact with your brain&#39;s own rhythms to alter how you fill in or interpret what you are seeing.\n   Ganzflicker is known to elicit the experience of anomalous sensory information in the external environment, called pseudo-hallucinations. &#34;Simple&#34; experiences - like seeing lasers or illusory colours - have previously been explained as your brain reacting to  clashes between Ganzflicker and the brain&#39;s rhythms.\n   The brain is composed of many different regions interacting with each other, including &#34;low-level&#34; sensory regions and regions that correspond to &#34;high-level&#34; cognitive processes. Discriminating whether a line is vertical or horizontal, for example, is considered a low-level sensory process, whereas determining whether a face is friendly or annoyed is a high-level cognitive process. The latter is more open to interpretation.\n Visual mental imagery, or the mental simulation of sensory information \u2013 the &#34;mind&#39;s eye&#34; \u2013 is one of these high-level cognitive processes. High-level processes can interact with low-level processes to shape your brain&#39;s interpretation of what you are seeing.\n If someone sees simple pseudo-hallucinations in the Ganzflicker, their brains may automatically interpret that information as more meaningful or realistic with help from their mind&#39;s eye.\n   What most people don&#39;t realise is that everyone&#39;s imagery is different. Some people have imagery that is as vivid as actually seeing something in front of them. A small proportion of people have a &#34;blind mind&#39;s eye&#34; and cannot even visualize the faces of their friends or family. This condition  is called aphantasia, and has attracted an increasing amount of attention in the last few years.\n   It is very difficult to describe and compare imagery experiences, since they are private, internal, subjective events. But it turns out that the Ganzflicker can help.\n We discovered that imagery ability can be reflected in an individual&#39;s description of a ten-minute experience with Ganzflicker. Almost half of people with aphantasia see absolutely nothing in the Ganzflicker.\n The other half see mostly simple patterns like geometric shapes or illusory colors. Compare that to people with visual mental imagery, for whom the majority see meaningful complex objects, such as animals and faces. Some even see entire pseudo-hallucinatory environments, like a stormy beach or a medieval castle.\n   Going back to the idea of brain rhythms, it&#39;s possible that people who see imagery have naturally lower-frequency rhythms in visual cortex - closer to the Ganzflicker frequency - which makes them susceptible to experiencing pseudo-hallucinations.\n People with aphantasia, on the other hand, have naturally higher-frequency rhythms in the visual cortex \u2013 which may give them a buffer against the effects of the Ganzflicker.\n Our theory is that mental imagery and pseudo-hallucinations elicited by Ganzflicker are tapping into the same processes in the brain. This means that Ganzflicker captures a dynamic projection of people&#39;s imagined experiences, like opening a window to the mind&#39;s eye.\n Ganzflicker is therefore a promising tool for understanding individual differences in mental imagery and its interaction with the visual environment.\n The experiment can help people share their unique experiences with each other \u2013 ultimately bringing subjective experience into the real world.\n  This article is republished from  The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It was declared a millennium problem in th year 2000.\n A Hyderabad-based mathematician has claimed to solve a 161-year-old problem, media reports said. Dr Kumar Eswaran found the solution to the Riemann Hypothesis during his service at the Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology (SNIST), the institute said, according to reports.\n It is one of the biggest problems to baffle mathematicians around the world who toiled hard to prove or disprove the hypothesis. The Riemann Hypothesis was declared a millennium problem in the year 2000 by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge.\n  The SNIST said in a release that the institute formed a committee to check the claims of Dr Eswaran and found the solution to be true. The committee arrived at the decision after a detailed and careful perusal of the solution presented by the mathematician.\n The review started in February last year and went on for a year, the institute said.\n The Riemann Hypothesis arose from the work of noted mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in the 19th century. The formula deals with understanding the distribution of prime numbers.\n Solving the hypothesis could open the doors for the use of primes in cryptography, and also impact the number theory, experts have said. A number of theorems also depend on the solving of the hypothesis.\n     Close", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:40:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "riemann,mathematician,\u7814\u7a76\u6240", "title": "\u6d77\u5fb7\u62c9\u5df4\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u58f0\u79f0\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86riemann\u5047\u8bbe ", "title_en": "Hyderabad mathematician claims he has solved Riemann Hypothesis", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-mathematician-claims-he-has-solved-riemann-hypothesis-101624857367051.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["riemann", "\u7814\u7a76\u6240"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9528af6bfce808d4116f5eee0100407d.jpg", "infoid": 1068463, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u968f\u7740\u4e16\u754c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u6e29\u6696\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u53f9\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u51b7\u7684\u5730\u65b9 - \u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5929\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u773c\u775b\u3002\n   \u5728\u4e00\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u5bdf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5982\u6b64\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5357\u6781\u6d32\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6e56\u6cca\u7a81\u7136\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u5357\u6781\u6e56\u7a81\u7136\u6d88\u5931\u57282019\u5e74\u51ac\u5b63\u3002\n \u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u62a5\u544a\u8fd9\u662f\u6c34\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u5757\u6c34\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5357\u90e8\u963f\u6885\u5229\u51b0\u8d27\u67b6\u4e0a\u7684\u6e56\u6cca\u6301\u6709\u7ea6600-750\u4e07\u7acb\u65b9\u7c73\uff0821-26\u4ebf\u7acb\u65b9\u82f1\u5c3a\uff09\u7684\u6c34\uff1a\u8d85\u8fc7\u6089\u5c3c\u6e2f\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6c34\uff0c\u6216\u5927\u81f4\u4e24\u500d\u4e8e\u5723\u5730\u4e9a\u54e5\u6e7e\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\n \u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u591a\u7684\u6c34\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6d88\u5931\u5728\u8584\u7684\u7a7a\u6c14\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u8bf4\uff0c\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6c34\u5e93\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6323\u624e\u7684\u51b0\u5c42\u6765\u8bf4\u592a\u591a\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u4e86\u3002\n  \u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1a\u8986\u76d6\u6e56\u6cca\uff08\u5de6\uff09\u7684Landsat 8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u6c34\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff08\u53f3\uff09\u540e\u51b0\u76d6\u6e56\uff08\u5de6\uff09\u548c\u8fbe\u6797\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u8fd9\u5ea7\u6df1\u6e56\u4e2d\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u6c34\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u5728\u6e56\u4e2d\u7684\u51b0\u67b6\u4e2d\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u88c2\u7f1d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u6c34\u529b\u6298\u5e94\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6c34\u6392\u51fa\u5230\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u4e2d\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5927\u5b66\u8bf4\u51b0\u5ddd\u5b66\u5bb6\u7f57\u5170\u534e\u7eb3\u3002\n \u6d2a\u6c34\uff0c\u54ea\u4e2a\u534e\u7eb3\u5bf9\u5c3c\u4e9a\u52a0\u62c9\u7011\u5e03\u7684\u91cd\u7269 - \u9664\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u8fdb\u5165\u51b0\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b - \u5728\u5927\u7ea6\u4e09\u5929\u5185\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u5927\u7ea6\u4e09\u5929\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\u6574\u4e2a\u6e56\u6cca\u88ab\u6392\u51fa\uff0c\u536b\u661f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8868\u660e\u3002 \n\u90a3\u4e9b\u8bfb\u6570\u6ca1\u6709\u53ea\u662f\u6355\u83b7\u73b0\u573a\u4ece\u4e0a\u9762\u770b\u7684\u90a3\u6837;

", "note_en": "As the world gets warmer,  staggering transformations are taking place in some of Earth&#39;s coldest locations \u2013 events that might go completely unnoticed by humans, were it not for our eyes in the sky.\n   In a  new study, satellite observations reveal one such stunning phenomenon: The sudden disappearance of a gigantic lake in Antarctica, which abruptly vanished from view during winter 2019.\n This was no small body of water, researchers report, with estimates the lake on  Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica held some 600\u2013750 million cubic meters (21\u201326 billion cubic feet) of water: more than all the water in Sydney Harbor, or roughly twice the volume of San Diego Bay.\n Of course, that much water doesn&#39;t simply disappear into thin air. In this case, scientists say the huge reservoir most likely became too much for the ice layer underneath struggling to support it.\n  Above: Landsat 8 images of the ice-covered lake (left) and the doline after the waters vanished (right).\n &#34;We believe the weight of water accumulated in this deep lake opened a fissure in the ice shelf beneath the lake, a process known as hydrofracture, causing the water to drain away to the ocean below,&#34;  says glaciologist Roland Warner from the University of Tasmania.\n The deluge, which Warner likens to the heavy flow of Niagara Falls \u2013 except ultimately into the ocean under the ice shelf \u2013 took place over about three days, during which the entire lake was drained, satellite observations suggest.\n   Those readings didn&#39;t just capture what the scene looked like from above; measurements from NASA&#39;s ICESat\u20132 also registered changes in ice shelf elevation resulting from the water displacement.\n Understandably, when such a giant pool of water is removed from a floating ice shelf, you would expect the ice shelf underneath to rise up, free of the previous weight pressing it down. Here, the affected region surrounding the lake lifted by up to 36 meters, the researchers say.\n While the  growing emergence of meltwater lakes and  streams across the surface of Antarctica are generally considered evidence of  climate change, the researchers say we don&#39;t yet know enough about these hydrofracturing events themselves to say whether they too are linked.\n But it&#39;s something we need to watch, because when these lakes burst through unstable ice shelves, the volume of that water ingress directly adds to the ocean&#39;s water volume. In accumulation, this phenomenon - together with other melting processes - contributes to eventual sea level rise.\n  Above: Visualization of the 600-750 million cubic meters of water lost to the ocean from the lake.\n &#34;Antarctic surface melting has been projected to double by 2050, raising concerns about the stability of other ice shelves,&#34; the researchers  write in their study, noting that &#34;processes such as hydrofracture and flexure remain under-studied, and ice-sheet models do not yet include realistic treatment of these processes.&#34;\n   It&#39;s time we rectified that, because the flow of meltwater shows no signs of stopping.\n After the lake&#39;s disappearance in winter 2019, the lake began to fill again as ice melt picked up in summer 2020, peaking at a flow of over 1 million cubic meters of water per day flowing into the icy cavity left behind, called a  doline.\n It&#39;s not fully clear if this newer lake will also vanish through fractures in the ice, or when that might occur, the researchers say, but it&#39;s possible that the pooled meltwater in the doline could already be leaking to the ocean.\n &#34;It does appear that the fracture reopened briefly during the 2020 summer melt season, so it is certainly a system to watch,&#34;  Warner says.\n &#34;This event does raise new questions about how common these deep ice-covered lakes are on ice shelves and how they evolve.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:39:09", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6c34\u529b,antarctic,\u6e56\u6cca",

affiliate commissions from the links on this page.  Terms of use.\n       According to Microsoft, Windows 11 will take a substantial step backward relative to Windows 10. Specifically, Windows 11 Home will now  require both internet access and a Microsoft account in order to set up the PC.\n  Speaking as a reviewer, this requirement is ludicrous. I build and wipe testbeds on a regular basis. I am not interested in creating a burner account to handle this task and I do not always need to connect a testbed to the internet. If I am attempting to benchmark the behavior of two specific versions of Windows, an OS that forces me to update to the latest version as a condition of installation literally prevents me from doing my job.\n I recognize, however, that I\u2019m a niche case. While I find these strictures annoying, they aren\u2019t problems for your average PC user. And they aren\u2019t the reason I will never log into a Microsoft account in order to use my own PC.\n  I\u2019m willing to cop to the fact that this may be an artifact of the time in which I grew up. To me, my PC and \u201cthe internet\u201d are two entirely different things. I connect to the latter to download files, read news, and watch content, but it is not the totality of my personal computer. Using an online account to log into my personal PC breaches the distinction between the two. Weird as it is \u2014 because I\u2019m willing to admit this is a personal oddity \u2014 I find that distinction matters to me. It actually matters a lot. I don\u2019t  want my local Windows account to be synonymous with an online login.\n   The other reason I won\u2019t use an online account is that Microsoft won\u2019t stop trying to force me to use one.\n I\u2019m not accusing Microsoft of having spied on users or abused its data-gathering capabilities. While there were some telemetry concerns with Windows 10 initially, the company addressed them in later updates. There have been no privacy or security scandals caused by the use of a Microsoft account instead of a local account. As far as I\u2019m aware, using a Microsoft account instead of a local account does not risk your personal privacy or security.\n  My problem with Microsoft and non-local accounts is this: Since the introduction of Windows 10, Microsoft has pulled every dirty trick in the book. It has obfuscated the ability to create a local account by hiding it in unclear language. It has deployed installers that hid the option to create a local account unless you were offline when you ran setup. It has deployed \u201cGet Windows 10\u201d tools that were so aggressive, they acted more like malware than a product built by a Fortune 500 company.\n  I will not  be browbeaten into adopting an online account as a local login because Microsoft found it convenient to gaslight its own users into submission. Had Microsoft offered the option as a feature with Windows 10 and left the issue alone thereafter, I might have switched eventually. But it didn\u2019t. It\u2019s  important to Microsoft that you use an online account.\n   I don\u2019t know why Microsoft wants everyone to use an online login. I don\u2019t know why Microsoft felt it had the right to treat its customers the way it did with the Get Windows 10 campaign or its six-year battle to push everyone to use online accounts. But I will not play this game. I will not hedge and say \u201cWell, you can actually create a local account after you sign in for the first time and switch to that.\u201d Defaults have tremendous power  and Microsoft knows it.\n The option to create a Windows login via an online account is great. The requirement to do so is an unacceptable intrusion into what\u2019s supposed to be the user\u2019s  personal computer. I am uninterested in joining the Greater Microsoft Data Conglomerate in any capacity beyond the level I\u2019m already forced to participate in and I\u2019m will not reward what I view as borderline abusive behavior with compliance. Companies that intend to treat your data ethically do not grasp for it like a slobbering ambulance chaser.\n According to  Satya Nadella, \u201cWindows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.\u201d Maybe it did once. Today, \u201cagency for consumers\u201d appears to mean \u201cagency for consumers, so long as they make  Microsoft-approved choices, use  Microsoft services and products, do not wish to delay updates, and  do not mind their PCs rebooting out from under them without warning.\u201d\n  That\u2019s not the kind of agency I had in mind when I sat down to learn MS-DOS 3.1 some thirty years ago. It\u2019s not the kind of agency I had in mind when I bought my first PC running Windows 98 SE.

This is the native home of hope. When it fully learns that cooperation, not rugged individualism, is the quality that most characterizes and preserves it, then it will have achieved itself and outlived its origins. Then it has a chance to create a society to match its scenery. \u2014 Wallace Stegner,  The Sound of Mountain Water   1\n Here is the essential point: California has never had enough water. The current drought is simply the latest evidence that this is a dry land, not \u201csusceptible of supporting a very large population,\u201d\u00a0as an American military officer wrote in the 1840s.   2 But of course the region has shown itself more than susceptible of supporting \u2014 or at least attracting \u2014 a very large population. Modern California, with almost forty million people, and the largest economy in the United States, has seemed again and again to overcome the limits of its natural environment.\n Modern California is in fact an extraordinary achievement. To make a semi-arid region not only habitable but also prosperous and abundant has required  massive and sustained geo-engineering \u2014 the construction, over generations, of a complex network of reservoirs and dams, of aqueducts, tunnels, and canals, of pumping stations and treatment plants, much of which is dedicated not only to harvesting, storing, and supplying water but also to transporting it from where it originates, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, to where it is needed, in the great coastal cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles and the farmlands of the Central Valley.\n The history of this achievement has been amply documented, from the mid 19th-century settlement of the Central Valley and its development into  one of the most highly managed agricultural landscapes on the planet, what historian Kevin Starr has called \u201cthe most productive unnatural landscape in the world\u201d   3; to the diversion of Owens Lake, in the eastern Sierras, a century ago, to provide water for the growing metropolis of Los Angeles; to the flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley, in Yosemite, to create the reservoir that for decades has served San Francisco, more than 150 miles to the west.   4\n But the very success of this achievement has produced a  wicked tangle of problems which are not only ecological and environmental but also political, economic, and legal. Hetch-Hetchy Dam was controversial from the start (early opponents included the Sierra Club and its founder John Muir) and remains so today, with activists clamoring for the restoration of the valley. Owens Lake enabled the rise of L.A. but was eventually pumped dry and became,\u00a0 as Karen Piper put it in an article in this journal,\u00a0\u201ca howling wasteland of toxic dust.\u201d And the transformation of the 450-mile-long, 50-mile-wide Central Valley from a region of shallow lakes and vast marshes into a gridded geometry of irrigated farmlands has required the pumping of enormous amounts of groundwater, which has led to  soil subsidence and heaved roads and fractured canals. More ominously, it has led to depletion of the Valley aquifer; because groundwater pumping is unregulated, it\u2019s unclear how much fresh water now remains, but already farmers are digging  deeper and deeper wells\u00a0and depending upon increasingly saline water to irrigate their orchards and fields. And along the way, the state\u2019s increasingly sophisticated capacity to move and manage water has been accompanied by an increasingly complex and irreconcilable series of legal agreements, from unquantifiable principles like \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d (1848) and \u201creasonable use\u201d (1886), to \u201csafe yield\u201d (1903) and \u201cpublic trust\u201d (1930), to the more recent \u201c co-equal goals\u201d (2010).   5 Unsurprisingly these have proven contentious and led to the ongoing water wars that have defined the state\u2019s politics and determined its economy.\n Katherine Jenkins\u2019s photographs \u2014 taken along the California Aqueduct, which carries Sierra Nevada snowmelt southward via a network of dams, reservoirs, channels, and pumping plants, beginning in the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta and ending in Lake Perris \u2014 depict what you might call scenes from the\u00a0frontlines\u00a0of the water wars. The reservoir of Lake Oroville, at a quarter of its capacity; the San Luis Reservoir at nineteen percent. A dessicated cornfield in the Delta. A pipe that\u2019s run dry in abandoned farmlands near Lost Hills, west of Bakersfield, and a pomegranate orchard sprouting from the parched earth, also in Lost Hills. Pipe arrays climbing treeless slopes. A dry canal. In all these scenes we see a system that\u2019s at once powerful, built to get water \u201cto where it is needed,\u201d and tenuous, as it runs up against non-negotiable limits.\n The\u00a0historian Leo Marx has argued that the concept of  technology refers not simply to machines but also to the ways in which industrial innovations have \u201ctransform[ed] the fundamental conditions of life.\u201d   6 In this sense technology refers also to logistics bureaucracies and capital resources, to political negotiations and legal agreements \u2014 and indeed to the American narratives of progress, control, and destiny. But now to this list we need to add strategies for  environmental adaptation and disaster mitigation. Jenkins\u2019s photographs might be viewed as a kind of visible inventory of these abstract practices and processes, a record of some of the artifacts by which California has, to use Stegner\u2019s terms, \u201cachieved itself.\u201d But now it\u2019s clear that if the state is to \u201coutlive its origins,\u201d future development will need to reconcile longstanding water interests with ecological imperatives that have emerged more lately. For as Stegner also wrote, \u201cEven an oasis civilization, if it tinkers enough with the environment, may be in danger of depleting and destroying it.\u201d   7\n  Wallace Stegner,  The Sound of Mountain Water: The Changing American West (original publication, 1969, reprint New York: E.P.

format in its Top News carousel last month. This means website owners no longer need to publish an extra set of pages written in the AMP format. Instead sites need to meet what Google calls &#34;Core Web Vitals.&#34;\n This sounds like great news. As a  long-time critic of Google AMP, I wish I could say that Google AMP is over and done with, but I&#39;m not convinced.\n As I wrote years ago when it launched, Google&#39;s AMP is bad \u2013 bad in a potentially web-destroying way. It&#39;s bad for how the web is built, it&#39;s bad for publishers of credible online content, and it&#39;s bad for consumers of that content. Google AMP is only good for one party: Google.\n   And make no mistake, AMP format pages did not just disappear from the web. It&#39;s great that AMP is no longer required to get in Google&#39;s coveted Top News carousel, but that doesn&#39;t mean AMP is gone.\n   Requiring publishers to use the AMP format for news is a moot point. All of the major purveyors of news already use AMP. Google doesn&#39;t need to require AMP because there&#39;s no one left to force into using it. Rolling back the AMP requirement isn&#39;t a sign of victory for the open web, it&#39;s a sign of defeat.\n     The other problem is that if you were a publisher interested in dropping support for AMP, Google News isn&#39;t the only game to consider.\n AMP links are widely used throughout other Google services, including Gmail, Google Images, and Google Search. Even though it&#39;s no longer required for Google News, around a month after Google&#39;s ranking changes took effect, almost every story currently in the Google News carousel is still using AMP.\n   All of which is to say that Google AMP was forced on publishers and, given no choice, publishers embraced it \u2013 so don&#39;t expect it to go away now just because it&#39;s no longer required. Big media publishers are slow to adopt and even slower to abandon.\n Unfortunately, I don&#39;t expect AMP links to disappear any time soon. You can always do the web a favour by installing a browser plugin to toss out the AMP URL and give you the link to the actual URL (I like  this one). It&#39;s a pain, but if we want to keep the web as AMP-free as possible, we&#39;re all going to have to do a little work.\n  Before I get into why AMP&#39;s replacement might be worse, it would help to back up and define what AMP is, because things have changed since it launched. AMP is now an open-source web component framework developed by the AMP Open Source Project. See Google anywhere in that sentence? No, no you don&#39;t. Google has distanced itself from AMP considerably over the years, but it hasn&#39;t given up control.\n Google AMP began with the stated goal of speeding up the web. The logic behind AMP goes like this: web developers suck at making fast websites, let&#39;s strip out all the stuff people don&#39;t need and cache it on our super-fast servers. That  sounds good. It&#39;s not hard to see how well-meaning people would get behind that idea. The problem is that being fast isn&#39;t what makes the web great. It&#39;s part of it, but it&#39;s not the most important part.\n Another common defence of AMP you&#39;ll hear is that it&#39;s open source. This is true, but also a non sequitur. There is nothing inherently good about something being open source. As web developer  Ferdy Christant put it back in 2018, the open source defence &#34;isn&#39;t just a weak defense, it&#39;s no defense at all. I can open-source a plan for genocide. The term &#39;open source&#39; is meaningless if the thing that is open source is harmful.&#34; Quite.\n   Since we&#39;ve now invoked something akin to  Godwin&#39;s Law, let&#39;s pause for a moment to address the question, is Google or AMP &#34;evil&#34;? I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t matter. The people behind AMP might have had good intentions, they might not have. Google does not have to be &#34;evil&#34; for it to do things that harm the open web.\n  Regardless of motivation, the fact remains that the AMP developers produced something that is bad for the open web ecosystem because it destroys three sacrosanct elements of the web: the URL, the open web standard of HTML, and the decentralisation of the web.\n The URL is destroyed because when you visit an AMP page you visit a cached URL. Share that URL and the people who visit it will also visit the Google cache, not the publisher&#39;s URL. There is no web when that happens. There is just traffic coming to Google, which is good for... Google. To my mind this the biggest problem with AMP. The URL is the web. Literally. Without the URL you have nothing.\n AMP doesn&#39;t stop there; it also strips out all kinds of perfect valid, approved-by-standards-bodies HTML. Programmers hate HTML. It&#39;s messy, vague, imprecise, and user agents must deal with that, which is a huge pain for programmers. It&#39;s a valid criticism in many ways, but it also misses the fact that these are exactly the qualities that have enabled millions of people to use HTML. It&#39;s messy, vague, imprecise, and perfect for creating the web. What&#39;s more, it is developed very slowly, by many people, representing many points of view, many needs. AMP is a set of programming guidelines shoved down your throat by Google.\n The third problem with AMP is that it disrupts the web&#39;s decentralised design. This is really an outgrowth of the two things, but important in its own right when we start considering Google AMP&#39;s ostensible replacement, &#34;Core Web Vitals.&#34;\n Decentralisation means that no one entity controls web content. With AMP, Google gets total control of the content. Google hosts it, and Google alone knows who visits it.\n The final point is either ironic or, if you lean towards conspiracy, proof that Google knows exactly what it&#39;s doing here \u2013 namely, locking up content where Google can control it and mine users for data. Are you ready for it? Google AMP pages aren&#39;t any faster than regular HTML pages. Worse, they&#39;re often slower. Nope, not kidding. When AMP pages are faster, it&#39;s because Google is pre-loading them, which Google could do for any page on the web.\n Still, getting a spot in the Top News carousel of Google News is a powerful carrot, and it worked. Nearly every major publisher on the web (including this one) publishes AMP versions of their pages.\n Now AMP is no longer required of publishers, those of us shouting about how this is bad can just shut up now, right?\n Unfortunately, there are problems with AMP&#39;s replacement as well. And those problems go right back to what was wrong with AMP in the first place: Google is in charge of it.\n As web developer Ethan Marcotte  points out: &#34;While the shift to Core Web Vitals is a step in the right direction, it also means that Google alone determines what a &#39;great page experience&#39; means.&#34;\n Currently it  means your page should mostly load in 2.5 seconds. That&#39;s not a very high bar to be honest, but it is still a bar and the web does not do bars. Worse, that requirement might change tomorrow. Marcotte makes it clear that he thinks deprioritising AMP in favour of Core Web Vitals is a very good thing, but I&#39;m not so sure that&#39;s true. Neither, it seems, is Marcotte, who goes on to note that Google has &#34;taken its proprietary document format, and swapped it out for a proprietary set of performance statistics that has even less external oversight.&#34;\n  In the end AMP and Core Web Vitals boil down to a very simple reality: Google is again using its dominance in the search business to force everyone to play on its terms. Whether that&#39;s a proprietary markup language or some arbitrary set of performance standards, the end result is the same. Google is a monopoly and it is using its monopoly position to force the rest of the web into doing what it wants.\n Google AMP and its successor are classic examples that could have been pulled from another monopoly&#39;s playbook: embrace, extend, and extinguish. The difference is that Google is being much more clever about how it extinguishes things than Microsoft ever was. Google embraced HTML, then extended it with AMP and now, in claiming to have extinguished AMP, it gets the control it wants without the bad press. The slight twist in the extinguish move is a nice touch, Google. Well played.\n I&#39;ve said it  before, I&#39;ll say it again. The power of the web lies in its decentralisation, it lies with its messiness, it lies with its edge nodes \u2013 that is, with you and me. We rejected AMP, it may be fading, but we need to keep rejecting. If we reject Core Web Vitals, it too will die. \u00ae\n     UK artists seek &#39;luvvie levy&#39; on new gadgets to make up for all the media that consumers access online\n     Leading lights in the world of &#34;the arts&#34; have called for a techy tax on mobiles, laptops, and PCs to help finance creative industries they claim have been ravaged by lack of revenue and funding.\n  DACS \u2013 the visual artists&#39; rights management nonprofit \u2013 reckons a levy of 1-2 per cent on the sale of new tech gadgets could help raise \u00a3250m-\u00a3300m a year.\n  Part of the reasoning behind the initiative, it said, is that it would help redress the balance caused by people accessing music, films, and other creative material online without paying for it directly.\n  Continue reading\n  Panasonic&#39;s Toughbook G2 tablet will feature 10-finger touch even with gloves on and full Windows 11 compatibility.\n  Continue reading\n  Bezos v Branson: Battle of the wannabe Space Barons as Virgin Galactic cleared by FAA to start flying customers\n     A pair of rich white men look set to duke it out at the edge of space after Virgin Galactic was given the green light by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly customers to space.\n  Continue reading\n  Fujitsu wins \u00a39m contract hike for Oracle HR system running nearly 3 years late at Northern Ireland Education Authority\n     Fujitsu has been awarded a \u00a39.2m contract extension by the Northern Ireland Education Authority for changes to the implementation of an Oracle HR and payroll system that is already nearly three years late.\n  The project \u2013 first known as the EA Integrated Financial Management Information System, now dubbed EA One Project \u2013 began in 2015 with a \u00a320m contract award to the Japanese supplier.

Another deteriorating part of the decades-old Hubble Space Telescope has found itself in a jam. This time its camera unit is once again in the middle of a clash between scientists over whether or not the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 contains any dark matter.\n  When DF2 was  written up in a  Nature paper in 2018, the study immediately raised eyebrows. The paper concluded the galaxy was devoid of dark matter. How could that be possible?\n  The mysterious substance is thought to be present in all galaxies, holding together glittering stars, swirls of dust and gas, and more, giving the galaxies structure and shape. Dark matter is a crucial component in theories of galactic formation, and finding a galaxy without this hidden stuff, or a very low quantity of it, breaks all the rules.

Announced by Linus Torvolds on Monday, the newest version is said to be one of the bigger releases in the version 5 range, with over 16 thousand commits made by over 2 thousand developers.\n For Mac users, the key addition to the kernel is support for a number of ARM-based chips, which crucially includes the  M1. The new kernel is therefore able to be run natively on Apple Silicon hardware, including the M1  Mac mini and the  24-inch iMac.\n While the ability to use M1 is included,  Phoronix  reports there&#39;s still more work to be done, including adding support for accelerated graphics. Other changes include a variety of updated drivers, architecture and file system improvements, and changes to process handling and tooling.\n  Linux 5.13 is not the first version of the operating system that works with the M1. In January,  security researchers at Corellium ported a version of Ubuntu to the chip, a process that required  many workarounds to get going, in part due to Apple&#39;s lack of documentation on how the chip functioned.\n Keep up with everything Apple in the weekly AppleInsider Podcast \u2014 and get a fast news update from AppleInsider Daily.
