I\u2019ve made over $100k on that platform and was able to career shift through it. The reason why I\u2019m posting about this is to understand whether I\u2019m being in a fair or a non-fair position from an external perspective.\n It\u2019s important to note that I\u2019ve informed Upwork\u2019s support that I\u2019ll post this problem externally online on Medium and my website. They didn\u2019t inform me not to.\n  I started off on Upwork a few years back. I built my status slowly and learned a huge deal along the way. In 2018, I signed a client as usual. Let\u2019s call him \u201cRobin\u201d for the sake of the non-disclosure agreements.\n Robin was far by the best and the worst thing that ever happened to me on Upwork. I\u2019ve worked with him till Sept of 2020. Robin worked with me fairly and I never had any dispute with Upwork on him. He needed presentations for investments, plans, designs, financial sheets; all within my area of expertise.\n It was perfect. I even met Robin in real life in Zurich, instead of virtually. We continued working via Upwork while locating in Zurich, as to not violate any Upwork terms.\n  There are two ways of recording how you work on Upwork, either  hourly through the software or  adding manual hours. They state it very obvious that  a freelancer falls under the Upwork protection if they record their hours through the software, not manually.\n I meet Robin, and we conduct a brainstorming session and a few meetings. The only reasonable thing to do at this stage is to add manual hours. It doesn\u2019t make sense to open the software on a blank screen, and just click somewhere to keep the computer alive. Hence, I recorded manual hours, lots of them. I usually do that with other clients as well, it\u2019s never a problem.\n Here\u2019s when it could be a problem: If  the client on Upwork asks for a chargeback (refund). Then he might be entitled to it if you\u2019re manually recording the hours.\n I\u2019m on very good terms with Robin. He would never request a refund from Upwork, I\u2019m sure of that.\n Anyway, that lasted for a couple of years and ended when he informed me that he has issues with Upwork and his credit card. I just told him to go sort it out and call me when he\u2019s ready to work again. I will not work with him for free till he fixes his credit card on Upwork. In all cases,I don\u2019t care really, I have several other clients, and Upwork pays me per week. So, worst-case scenario, I would lose one week of earnings, but that\u2019s tolerable.\n   We are writing today to let you know that a payment made to your account has been reversed by your client\u2019s bank.\n This reversal (chargeback) is a result of your client contacting their bank and asking them to reverse the payment for the following transaction(s):\n    I went nuts. A day after, a few other freelancers whom we were working with, started contacting me saying that Upwork is asking all of them for a refund as well.\n Is Robin really asking for a chargeback? That\u2019s impossible. I start investigating by calling Robin. He apologized and said he never called any bank, additionally, he said this is a bit of a mess-up as he forgot that there is  \u201ca credit card connected in his account that wasn\u2019t actually his\u201d.\n Let me translate this. Robin has been using someone else\u2019s credit card for two years, and this other person realized that money was being withdrawn in the previous two years on a platform called Upwork without his consent.\n  I\u2019ve worked with Robin for two years, and I worked hard for this.\n  They told me, here\u2019s what you can do:\u200a\u2014\u200a Provide us with proof of your work, and we will try to convince the bank to not ask for this chargeback on behalf of their client.\u200a\u2014\u200aThat option sounds illogical in all sorts of ways.  Why would  a bank take my side (a freelancer from another country) instead of his own actual client who never actually requested those services?\n Nevertheless, I sent Upwork two years\u2019 worth of projects. They respond 40 days later telling me that they tried and failed. Then they said something that seemed, in my point of view, a bit of a human-right violation.\n \u201cYou have to pay this money back, what we want you to do is work on our platform and we will take your earnings from there. Till then, you\u2019re not allowed to withdraw any earnings.\u201d  (Paraphrasing)\n Let me get this straight\u200a\u2014\u200aUpwork, a billion-dollar company, wants me, a freelancer, to work for free on their platform for approximately 230 hours (with my hourly rate) because a client on their platform was using someone else\u2019s credit card? How in god\u2019s name is that my fault?\n Yes, the clients can ask for a chargeback if I record the hours manually and their case was proven.  But that\u2019s not the client asking for the money. That\u2019s  the credit card owner, who is another person. That\u2019s Upwork\u2019s fault for not vetting their clients.\n Eventually, I keep trying to open a communication channel with Upwork and their support concerning this refund situation. They insist on this situation.\n    Whoever owns the credit card can ask their bank to chargeback a payment. We cannot get around this, unfortunately.\n We consider this matter closed as we believe we have gone over this with you at length.\u201d\n They consider this matter closed. I even tried to raise a complaint on this \u201cEscalation\u201d department\u200a\u2014\u200atheir response  \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, the executive escalations are the highest tier.\u201d\n At the moment of this writing, I\u2019m still on the platform. It\u2019s a little bit demotivational knowing that the next 230 hours that I\u2019ll work will go to Upwork instead of me because of this, so I\u2019m slowed down on a motivational level.\n I\u2019ve worked honorably and by the book on Upwork for a long time. When things were not making sense, I still followed the rules. I could\u2019ve easily gotten paid from Robin outside of Upwork. Heck, he was physically in front of me. Yet, I respect how Upwork opened my eyes to becoming the person I am today, and for that, I\u2019m forever grateful.\n Whenever I speak to someone about this, they are shocked and deem it unfair. I decided to write this here because I would love to hear opinions on both sides of the matter. If you have any opinion on this matter, please share it with me.\n In my opinion, a better way to think of this is as follows\u200a\u2014\u200aIf you\u2019re working as a cook at Mcdonalds and it turns out that Mcdonalds has been scamming the world without you being aware. Do you, as a cook, have the responsibility to pay what you honorably earned back to the world?", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:15:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "client,\u7f57\u5bbe", "title": "\u6625\u5929\u8981\u6c42\u5ba2\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u5361\uff0c\u8981\u6c4212,500\u7f8e\u5143\u9000\u6b3e", "title_en": "Upwork asking for a $12,500 refund as the client was using someone else's card", "transed": 1, "url": "https://alanany.com/2021/12/23/upwork-12k-refund-client-using-another-credit-card/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["client", "\u7f57\u5bbe"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072483, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u56f4\u7ed5\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u751f\u4ea7\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u9891\u4e32\u79bb\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8303\u7574\u592a\u8fdc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u53e5\u67c4\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5730\u533a\u662f\u5f7b\u5e95\u6216\u5f7b\u5934\u5f7b\u5c3e\u7684\u5371\u9669\u3002\u8ba4\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u3002\n\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u8d77\u89c1\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8003\u8651\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e5f\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u3002\n\u8bbeM\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\\ mu\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\u03bc\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\u548c\u03c3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\\ sigma\uff08x\uff0c\\ theta_1\uff09\u03c3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u6709\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u53c2\u6570Th 1 \\ Theta_11 Th 1\u548cTh 2 \\Theta_2\u03b82\u3002\nl = 1 2\uff08y  - \u03bc\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\u03c3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b82\uff09\uff092 + log {2\u03c0\u22c5\u03a3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b82\uff09}\uff08iii\uff09\\\u6807\u7b7e{iii} \\ mathcal {l} = \\ frac {1} {2}\u5de6\uff08\\ frac {y  -  \\ mu\uff08x\uff0c\\ theta_1\uff09} {\\ sigma\uff08x\uff0c\\ theta_2\uff09} \\\u53f3\uff09^ 2 + log \\\uff0c\\ left \\ {\\ \uff0c\\ sqrt {2 \\ pi} \\ cdot \\ sigma\uff08x\uff0c\\ theta_2\uff09\\\uff0c\\\u53f3\\} l = 2 1\uff08\u03c3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b82\uff09y  - \u03bc\uff08x\uff0c\u03b81\uff09\uff09 2 +\u65e5\u5fd7{2\u03c0\u22c5\u03a3\uff08x\uff0c\u03b82\uff09}\n\u6a21\u578b \u3002 eval\uff08\uff09ronal_dist = model\uff08x\uff09\uff03\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u72b6\uff08n\uff0cm\uff09\u7684x\u4e0a\u7684\u578b\u53f7\u5747\u503c= normal_dist\u3002\u5747\u503c\uff03\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee5\u5f62\u72b6\uff08n\uff0c\uff09std = normal_dist\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u3002 stddev\uff03\u68c0\u7d22\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\uff08n\uff0c\uff09\n\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd - \u5f53\u6211\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u611f\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u6211\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "note_en": "Understanding and modeling uncertainty surrounding a machine learning prediction is of critical importance to any production model. It provides a handle to deal with cases where the model strays too far away from its domain of applicability, into territories where using the prediction would be inacurate or downright dangerous. Think medical diagnosis or self-driving cars.\n Modeling uncertainty is a whole field of research in itself, with vast amount of theory and plethora of methods. Briefly, for simple models (such as the ubiquitous  linear regression), analytic approaches provide an exact solution. For more complex models where an exact solution is intractable, statistical sampling approaches can be used, the gold standard of which are  Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (e.g. the state of the art  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo).\n However, when it comes to neural networks, both approaches fall short. Exact solutions are unavailable, and even the best sampling algorithms choke on the thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of parameters a typical neural network is made of.\n Thankfully, even if full Bayesian uncertainty is out of reach, there exist a few other ways to estimate uncertainty in the challenging case of neural networks.\n Today, we\u2019ll explore one approach, which boils down to  parametrizing a probability distribution with a neural network.\n We\u2019ll use nothing but good ol\u2019 PyTorch, thanks to the little known   distributions package.\n     The first step is to choose an appropriate probability distribution. The choice is context dependent: in a regression setting, a Normal or LogNormal distribution may be appropriate while for classifications, one would pick a Categorical distribution. Thankfully, PyTorch   distributions package provides implementation for all the major probability distributions.\n  For simplicity\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll consider the well known Normal distribution in the following, but the approach would be similar for any other probability distribution.\n The normal distribution       N \\mathcal{N}     N with mean       \u03bc \\mu    \u03bc and standard deviation       \u03c3 \\sigma    \u03c3 is defined as follows:\n z \u223c N ( \u03bc , \u03c3 ) \u2005\u200a \u27fa \u2005\u200a P ( z \u2223 \u03bc , \u03c3 ) =  1  \u03c3   2 \u03c0 \u22c5 e x p  { \u2212  1 2   (   z \u2212 \u03bc \u03c3 ) 2 }   (i) \\tag{i} z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma) \\iff P(z \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{z - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right\\}    z  \u223c     N ( \u03bc ,  \u03c3 )   \u27fa     P ( z  \u2223    \u03bc ,  \u03c3 )  =             \u03c3        2 \u03c0      \u200b          1 \u200b      \u22c5    e x p    { \u2212          2       1 \u200b         (          \u03c3       z  \u2212  \u03bc \u200b      )        2  }\n Here, \u201c      \u223c \\sim    \u223c\u201d merely means \u201csampled from\u201d, and       P ( z \u2223 \u03bc , \u03c3 ) P(z \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)    P ( z  \u2223    \u03bc ,  \u03c3 ) is the probability density function (PDF), a quantity that determines the likelihood of a value       z z    z given the distribution mean and standard deviation. Instances of Normal PDFs are shown below for various values of       \u03bc \\mu    \u03bc and       \u03c3 \\sigma    \u03c3.\n   Let\u2019s assume we are trying to model an outcome       y y    y from a set of features       x x    x. In the classical, non probabilistic setting, our neural network is represented by a function       f f    f, which depends both on the input       x x    x and the trainable parameters       \u0398 \\Theta    \u0398:\n   Looking back at the previous section, we can equate the prediction of our model with the distribution mean       \u03bc \\mu    \u03bc: not withstanding uncertainty,       \u03bc \\mu    \u03bc is the most probable outcome.\n  In turn, assuming a normal distribution is appropriate in this context, the standard deviation       \u03c3 \\sigma    \u03c3 is a good statistic to summarize the uncertainty surrounding our prediction.\n Let       \u03bc ( x ,  \u0398 1 ) \\mu(x, \\Theta_1)    \u03bc ( x ,   \u0398        1 \u200b    ) and       \u03c3 ( x ,  \u0398 1 ) \\sigma(x, \\Theta_1)    \u03c3 ( x ,   \u0398        1 \u200b    ) be two  sub networks with respective trainable parameters        \u0398 1 \\Theta_1     \u0398        1 \u200b    and        \u0398 2 \\Theta_2     \u0398        2 \u200b   .\n The mean network       \u03bc ( x ,  \u0398 1 ) \\mu(x, \\Theta_1)    \u03bc ( x ,   \u0398        1 \u200b    ) is nothing more than the original network       f f    f, i.e. the model prediction. The second network       \u03c3 ( x ,  \u0398 2 ) \\sigma(x, \\Theta_2)    \u03c3 ( x ,   \u0398        2 \u200b    ) is responsible for explicitly modeling uncertainty. From (i), we get:\n y \u223c N \u2009 [ \u2009 \u03bc ( x ,  \u0398 1 ) , \u03c3 ( x ,  \u0398 2 ) \u2009 ]   (ii) \\tag{ii} y \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\,[\\,\\mu(x, \\Theta_1), \\sigma(x, \\Theta_2)\\,]    y  \u223c     N  [  \u03bc ( x ,   \u0398        1 \u200b    ) ,  \u03c3 ( x ,   \u0398        2 \u200b    )  ]\n Note that in practice,        \u0398 1 \\Theta_1     \u0398        1 \u200b    and        \u0398 2 \\Theta_2     \u0398        2 \u200b    overlap, i.e. the two networks share their first few layers. (We\u2019ll look at an in-depth example later on.)\n We now have two sub-networks, with both shared and distinct parameters. We\u2019d really like to train them jointly, using a single loss function.\n The probability density function of equation (i) is an ideal candidate: the trick is to maximize the likelihood of observing       y y    y, which the PDF represents exactly.\n It is best to take the logarithm of the PDF rather than dealing with the pesky exponential. Plus, PyTorch expects a function to minimize, so we are negating the quantity: the loss function is the  negative log likelihood of observing       y y    y given       x x    x,        \u0398 1 \\Theta_1     \u0398        1 \u200b    and        \u0398 2 \\Theta_2     \u0398        2 \u200b   :\n L =  1 2   (   y \u2212 \u03bc ( x ,  \u0398 1 )  \u03c3 ( x ,  \u0398 2 ) ) 2 + l o g \u2009  { \u2009   2 \u03c0 \u22c5 \u03c3 ( x ,  \u0398 2 ) \u2009 }   (iii) \\tag{iii} \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{y - \\mu(x, \\Theta_1)}{\\sigma(x, \\Theta_2)}\\right)^2 + log\\,\\left\\{\\,\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\cdot\\sigma(x, \\Theta_2)\\,\\right\\}     L  =             2       1 \u200b         (          \u03c3 ( x ,   \u0398        2 \u200b    )       y  \u2212  \u03bc ( x ,   \u0398        1 \u200b    ) \u200b      )        2  +    l o g     {         2 \u03c0      \u200b     \u22c5  \u03c3 ( x ,   \u0398        2 \u200b    )   }\n Notice how we recovered the  square of difference term       ( y \u2212 \u03bc  ) 2 (y - \\mu)^2    ( y  \u2212    \u03bc  )        2 from the classic mean squared error, decorated with terms dependent on the standard deviation.\n This is it, we have parametrized the normal distribution with a neural network and devised an appropriate loss function. Every input gets its own unique set of mean (prediction) and standard deviation (uncertainty) neatly calibrated from optimization of the PDF.\n   We\u2019ll use data from the  OLS Regression Challenge, where the goal is to predict cancer mortality rates in US counties based on a number of socio-demographic variables such as median age, income, poverty rate, unemployment rate, etc.\n We won\u2019t be discussing the dataset or data prep steps any further, but the code to reproduce is available on  this jupyter notebook.\n  class  DeepNormal ( nn .

Unexpected inputs should correlate with higher uncertainty (e.g. a self-driving car encountering a rare weather event).\n For our purpose here, unexpectedness is measured as the average deviation from the median of an instance\u2019s feature values. The most extreme the feature values, the more unexpected an instance.\n  There is an upward trend: uncertainty tends to grow with less expected inputs, just as it should.\n   In this post, we modeled uncertainty using the Normal distribution, but there are a plethora of other distributions available for different problems.\n   The benefit is an estimate of uncertainty around the model prediction, at the cost of a few extra layers.\n This approach is easy and versatile \u2014 it is my go to method when I need a sense of uncertainty.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:14:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5efa\u6a21,uncertainty,\u6a21\u578b", "title": "\u7528Pytorch\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "title_en": "Modeling Uncertainty with PyTorch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://romainstrock.com/blog/modeling-uncertainty-with-pytorch.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5efa\u6a21", "\u6a21\u578b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072482, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53d1\u5e03\u60a8\u5e0c\u671b\u6839\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7528\u6237ID\u6216\u7528\u6237\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\uff09\u6c47\u7387\u9650\u5236\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u60a8\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c42\u4e4b\u524d\u5e94\u7528\u901f\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u60a8\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u503c\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8bd5\u56fe\u9632\u6b62DOS\u653b\u51fb\u786e\u4fdd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8db3\u591f\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3002\n\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u4f4e\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u60a8\u4e00\u822c\u60f3\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684Auth-\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9a8c\u8bc1Auth-token\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u7ed9\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u901f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7528\u6237ID\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5426\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u670d\u52a1\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u603b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "note_en": "Posted    You want to rate limit requests based on application data such as User ID or User Loyalty. However you want to apply rate-limiting before the application layer, so you have no way to trust the client provided values.\n This is a common problem, making the industry-standard approach rate limiting by IP (or CIDR block). In fact some  popular  CDNs only support rate-limits keyed by IP. Unfortunately IP-based limiting usually insufficient as it either allows too much malicious traffic or blocks a significant number of legitimate users (imagine a lot of users behind a carrier-grade or office NAT).\n  Pass the application info in a proxy-visible part of the request such as a cookie.\n  Configure the rate limiter to use the application info. (likely falling back to IP-based keys)\n  The application must validate the info and provide a \u201cuseless\u201d response if it isn\u2019t accurate.\n Step 1 and 2 are quite obvious but step 3 is the secret ingredient to allow a \u201cdumb\u201d proxy to apply rate-limiting based on application values. Step 3 ensues that spoofed values don\u2019t provide any value to the attacker, defeating the purpose of spoofing them in the first place.\n Note that \u201cvalue to the attacker\u201d can be very broad, so make sure that it reflects your rate limiting goals.\n If you are trying to prevent DoS attacks ensure that the validation is sufficiently cheap.\n  If you are trying to prevent scraping ensure that you don\u2019t return any valuable data.\n  If the information is being passed in a cookie unset (or correct) the cookie and redirect the user to the same URL.\n  NGINX can support this quite easily. Here is an example of rate limiting by User ID which is passed in the  uid cookie.\n  This snippet applies the same limit to users and IPs but two  limit_req_zones can be used to enforce different limits for each group.\n   Be sure that you don\u2019t lock out a user based on a mismatch. For example if you use an auth-token in the cookie to validate the user ID don\u2019t return a 401 if the auth token is expired or revoked. This will result in the user having all request blocked with no obvious way to fix the problem. (Your support team will probably need to ask them to clear their cookies).\n As mentioned above a better option would be to clear the untrusted data so that the user reverts to the regular IP-based filtering.\n  The cost of validation is likely low. This is because you will generally want to validate the auth-token for authenticated requests anyways and validating the auth-token will often give you enough information to validate the rate-limiting settings anyways (for example the user ID). However for requests for public information this validation may be otherwise unnecessary and raise the overall cost of serving the requests.\n Unfortunately I don\u2019t know of any great solutions, this is a cost of rate limiting based on authentication, you actually need to perform the authentication! One workaround is excluding requests for public data from rate limiting, then you don\u2019t need to validate the authentication information. However be sure that the requests that bypass the rate-limit in sync between the rate-limiter and the application as any endpoint that isn\u2019t validated is effectively unlimited (as an attacker can send a random rate-limit key for each request). One easy way to keep this in-sync is to strip the rate-limit key from the request before passing it to the application, then the application doesn\u2019t have anything to validate. This approach will reduce the cost but will leave the application exposed to scrapers, using a very high IP-based rate limit may be enough to prevent the worst attacks without affecting many legitimate requests.\n   Passing the rate-limiting info via cookie is an easy option because it is automatically added by the browser to all subsequent requests, however basically any method will work, including URL parameters or custom headers. Just be careful about locking a user out. If you are using a custom method to pass the rate-limiting information you need to ensure that all of your clients will gracefully handle a request that has been rejected due to mismatched rate-limiting information.\n  If you have a flexible enough rate-limiting system you can even set the rate limit based on the application data. For example logged-in users may get 10r/s but logged in users who have spent at least $20 can make 20r/s. This can be a good way to prevent the effectiveness of account-spamming while serving your most loyal customers reliably.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:14:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u901f\u7387,rate,\u9a8c\u8bc1", "title": "\u6bcf\u7528\u6237\u901f\u7387\u9650\u5236", "title_en": "Per-User Rate Limiting", "transed": 1, "url": "https://kevincox.ca/2021/04/14/per-user-rate-limiting/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u901f\u7387", "rate", "\u9a8c\u8bc1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f5c4e174d1c475d3a8b1f6b1f8e85154.jpeg", "infoid": 1072481, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u79d1\u6280iPhone\u5236\u9020\u5546\u57f9\u517b\u4e86IMESSage\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u5fc5\u5907\u77ed\u4fe1\u5de5\u5177\u3002 Android\u7528\u6237\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u51c9\u723d\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u6ce1\u6ce1\uff1a'ew\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u3002", "note_en": "Tech     The iPhone maker cultivated iMessage as a must-have texting tool for teens.

Ambitious people should be spending much more of their time in Quadrant IV.\n   These may seem frivolous, but Quadrant IV is actually a useful complement to Quadrant II.\n  Quadrant II builds up your existing strengths, while Quadrant IV exposes you to new abilities and trains you in less immediately needed skills. These \u201cunimportant\u201d activities are chosen by your subconscious.  Your subconscious knows what you need. [1] Your conscious brain is much worse than your subconscious at identifying and prioritizing, because it\u2019s too busy thinking of Quadrant II things. That\u2019s why Quadrant IV activities invariably turn out to be useful, even though it doesn\u2019t look like it when you\u2019re doing them. [2]\n  Is emailing a stranger a waste of time, or could it open doors you didn\u2019t even know about?\n    Over time, nonurgent and unimportant activities create  serendipity; serendipity happens when an opportunity arises and you have the ability to take advantage of it. Time spent in Quadrant IV massively increases the chances that you have the combination of skills and circumstance needed to grasp the opportunity. [3]\n If you feel like your achievements aren\u2019t proportional to your hard work, consider whether you need more Quadrant IV in your life. As the famous phrase goes, \u201cThe peerless samurai walks the path of hardship, the light-hearted fool walks the path of providence.\u201d\n    [1] An important caveat: to benefit from Quadrant IV activities, you must avoid  superstimuli. Examples of superstimuli are heroin, video games, junk food. Superstimuli will hijack your subconscious and you won\u2019t get serendipity.\n [2] This is also why advice like \u201ccold email one person a day if you want to build a great network\u201d is useless; it\u2019s forcing Quadrant IV activities into Quadrant II, and overruling your subconscious.\n [3] A personal anecdote: serendipity arising from Quadrant IV activity has massively improved my life. I\u2019ve spent significant amounts of time playing competitive games, reading about rationality and effective altruism, emailing strangers to chat about things I was interested in, and blogging and writing. These \u201cunimportant\u201d activities have led to deep friendships, career transformations and monetary blessings many years down the line.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:11:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9677\u9631,importance,\u673a\u4f1a", "title": "\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9677\u9631", "title_en": "The Importance Trap", "transed": 1, "url": "https://brianlui.dog/2021/08/18/the-importance-trap/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9677\u9631", "\u673a\u4f1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3cf5cd8470ee4c29c9759277defbc8b1.png", "infoid": 1072479, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Garmin\u89c2\u770b\u5c71\u5730\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u521b\u5efa\u5e10\u6237\uff0c\u4e3aRJMCCANN101 / MBO\u5f00\u53d1\u4f5c\u51fa\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "note_en": "Garmin Watch Apps for Mountain Bike Orienteering.

That\u2019s not the case. The opposition to some of the proposed mines has been strong and may even be ramping up.\n Thacker PassLithium Americas\u2019 Thacker Pass lithium mine may be the biggest project on the horizon, and it is facing lots of opposition.\n Lithium Americas has been working for years on plans for Thacker Pass, which is about 60 miles northwest of Winnemucca.\n  The company\u2019s website says Thacker Pass is \u201cthe largest known lithium resource in the United States.\u201d Lithium Americas estimates there is $3.9 billion worth of recoverable lithium at the site. The company has said it hopes to start mining operations next year.\n  The mine is expected to produce up to 60,000 tons a year of battery-quality lithium carbonate, which would be a huge boost to the world supply of lithium. The mine is expected to employ about 300 people and have a 46-year mine life.\n    On Jan. 15, 2021, the last Friday of the Trump Administration, the Bureau of Land Management approved the Record of Decision for Thacker Pass, giving federal approval to the project.\n   That evening, Will Falk and Max Wilbert set out on an eight-hour drive to the Thacker Pass site to set up a camp nearby to protest the mine. People have been camped out there ever since.\n Falk and Wilbert are radical environmentalists, with Falk writing on the  protectthackerpass.org website that \u201cI hate fossil fuels and actively advocate for the dismantling of all industrial infrastructure \u2026\u201d\n Elisabeth Robson wrote on the website, \u201cMany people believe they can\u2019t live without cars. But all humans lived without cars until a mere 113 years ago, and we can do so again. A world without cars is a quieter, slower, and more wonderful world, not just for humans but for everyone.\u201d\n  \u201cI hope one day a militant and offensive environmental movement forms,\u201d Falk wrote.\n  The people opposed to the Thacker Pass mine and other lithium mine projects don\u2019t all hold these views, of course, but have a variety of reasons for their opposition.\n A March 10 letter in the Elko Daily Free Press from Alex Eisenberg said the plan to transition to electric vehicles in the years ahead \u201cis incredibly short-sighted and irresponsible and will do virtually nothing to curb carbon emissions, as electric car production is completely reliant on the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n \u201cThe Thacker Pass mine alone would burn 11,000 gallons of diesel every day for onsite operations,\u201d the letter said. \u201cDouble that for off-site operations. Carbon emissions are expected to be 150,000+ tons per year, equating to 2.3 tons of carbon for every ton of lithium produced. Hundreds of tons of sulfur (ironically a waste product from oil refineries) would be used daily in mine operations.\u201d\n    On Feb. 11, 2021, Edward Bartell, a rancher who owns property above and below the mine, filed a lawsuit with a long list of objections to the mine. One of his big concerns is the water the mine will use. The project\u2019s Environmental Impact Statement says the projected water demand for years 5 through 41 is equivalent to an average pumping rate of 3,224 gallons per minute.\n  On Feb. 26, 2021, the Western Watersheds Project, Wildlands Defense, Great Basin Resource Watch, and Basin and Range Watch filed a lawsuit saying the Thacker Pass Record of Decision did not adequately gauge the mine\u2019s impacts on greater sage grouse and other wildlife.\n Local Indigenous communities say Thacker Pass is important to them historically and in their daily lives. Local tribal members have been camping near the mine site to protest the mine.\n The tribal council of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, which is about 26 miles from the mine site, made an engagement agreement with Lithium Nevada in 2020, but withdrew from the agreement in March 2021.\n On July 28, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and Atsa Koodakuh Wyh Nuwu/People of Red Mountain were allowed to intervene as plaintiffs in the lawsuits against the mine. On Aug. 6, the Burns Paiute Tribe was also allowed to intervene.\n    On Sept. 5, U.S. District Court Judge Miranda Du denied a request from the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony and the People of Red Mountain for a preliminary injunction to temporarily halt work.\n  Falk is a lawyer for the People of the Red Mountain, but he told The Guardian he is skeptical they will be able to win by arguing the right things.\n \u201cEventually we\u2019re going to have to be ready to physically block construction equipment. I think that one of the ways to wake up people in the United States (is seeing) people getting dragged away by the police for trying to protect their land. And I think that\u2019s where this is going,\u201d Falk said.\n Humboldt County Manager Dave Mendiola told Inside Climate News, \u201cI guess you can chain yourself to the fence like some of the protesters might do and I don\u2019t blame them for that. But in the end, as a company, if they\u2019ve followed all the rules, you\u2019re probably not going to stop it. What we can do as a county is monitor it and come up with ways to address problems now.\u201d\n Rhyolite RidgeAt ioneer\u2019s proposed Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine about 65 miles southwest of Tonopah, debates continue over the Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat that is found only on the site.\n James Calaway, executive chairman of ioneer Ltd., said the company is working to protect the plant and increase the size of its habitat. He said about half of the plants were destroyed by drought and rodents last year.\n  John Scire, PhD, an adjunct professor at UNR, said in a December editorial that \u201cthe bottom line is that the Fish and Wildlife Service should veto the false claims by the Las Vegans that the ioneer mine will wipe out the buckwheat plants and should consider instead the macro environmental impacts of not letting the mine get cranked up ASAP. The best available science supports that the mine and the plant can co-exist.\u201d\n However, Patrick Donnelly, the Nevada director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said he disagrees with ioneer\u2019s expectation that the wildflower can be established near the current growing site.\n \u201cAttempts to propagate the plants failed,\u201d Donnelly told Mining the West magazine. \u201cThey all died, so ioneer doesn\u2019t have a plan. Their plan is bunk and doesn\u2019t reflect the consensus of the scientific community.\u201d\n   He said the Center for Biological Diversity does not oppose lithium mining, and lithium is \u201call over the place\u201d in Nevada.\n   Mike Kobler, general manager of U.S. operations for Tonopah Lithium Corp., told the Nye County commissioners at their Nov. 2 meeting that his company\u2019s mine site about six miles northwest of Tonopah could become one of the biggest lithium resources in the world.\n \u201cWe are in the perfect location in Nevada,\u201d Kobler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the sage grouse issues that they have up north, we don\u2019t have the desert tortoise issues that they have down south, we have not found any Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat; we\u2019ve cleared all of our environmental hurdles and cultural hurdles, so we\u2019re just moving ahead.\u201d\n In addition to Nevada, companies are also working on proposed lithium production sites in California, Oregon, Tennessee, Arkansas and North Carolina.\n   In Serbia, Rio Tinto has been planning a $2.4 billion lithium mine. For three consecutive weekends in late 2021, thousands of protesters blocked roads in Serbia to protest lithium mining, with environmentalists saying that extracting lithium causes huge damage to mined areas.\n On Dec. 16, authorities in western Serbia suspended a plan that would allow Rio Tinto to operate the lithium mine.\n \u201cWe will continue to provide information on all aspects of the project for which we are responsible and in which we participate,\u201d Rio Tinto said in a statement.\n Chile, which has about 44% of the world\u2019s lithium reserves, elected leftist Gabriel Boric as president on Dec. 19, but it is not clear what impact Boric\u2019s election will have on lithium mining. Boric has supported mining tax hikes and royalties and promised to create a state-run lithium company.\n  If efforts to stop proposed lithium mines in Nevada and elsewhere in the United States are successful, then as the need for lithium ramps up, lithium mining could escalate in countries that have fewer environmental regulations than the U.S., and more fuel will be burned shipping lithium and batteries around the world and to the U.S.\n In the \u201cNational Blueprint for Lithium Batteries 2021-2030\u201d published in June 2021, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm wrote, \u201cThe Biden Administration has laid out a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and build a clean and equitable energy economy that achieves carbon-pollution-free electricity by 2035, and puts the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050 to the benefit of all Americans.\u201d\n The report says the Federal Consortium for Advanced Batteries will \u201csecure U.S. access to raw materials for lithium batteries by incentivizing growth in safe, equitable, and sustainable domestic mining ventures while leveraging partnerships with allies and partners to establish a diversified supply.\u201d\n \u201cThe worldwide lithium battery market is expected to grow by a factor of 5 to 10 in the next decade,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe U.S. industrial base must be positioned to respond to this vast increase in market demand that otherwise will likely benefit well-resourced and supported competitors in Asia and Europe.\u201d\n However, on May 25, 2021, Reuters ran a story saying, \u201cU.S. President Joe Biden will rely on ally countries to supply the bulk of the metals needed to build electric vehicles and focus on processing them domestically into battery parts, part of a strategy designed to placate environmentalists, two administration officials with direct knowledge told Reuters.\n \u201cThe plans will be a blow to U.S. miners who had hoped Biden would rely primarily on domestically sourced metals, as his campaign had signaled last autumn.\u201d\n  Currently about 46% of the world\u2019s mine production of lithium is in Australia, and about 21% is Chile and another 16% is in China, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. In the United States, all the lithium mining is at one mine in Nevada, and accounts for less than 2% of the world\u2019s mine production.\n  Albemarle Corporation\u2019s Silver Peak lithium mine is about 40 miles southwest of Tonopah and has been in operation since the 1960s. A May 6, 2021 New York Times story said Silver Peak produces about 5,000 tons of lithium a year.\n On Jan. 7, 2021, Albemarle announced that it planned to invest $30 million to $50 million to double the lithium production at Silver Peak by 2025.\n The company also said it planned to begin exploration in 2021 and evaluate technology \u201cthat could accelerate the viability of lithium production from clay resources in the region.\u201d\n The lithium produced at Silver Peak is shipped to Asia to be made into cathodes for batteries.\n China has for years been focused on building capacity at every stage of the battery supply chain, according to a Sept. 1, 2020 VOA News story.\n China \u201chas been buying stakes in mining operations in Australia and South America where most of the world\u2019s lithium reserves are found,\u201d the VOA story said.\n China\u2019s Ganfeng Lithium, which has been \u201csnapping up lithium mines and salt lakes abroad as it plots out an ambitious road map for growth,\u201d according to a Dec. 8, 2021 Nikkei Asia story, is the largest shareholder in Lithium Americas, the company planning the Thacker Pass mine, according to the New York Times story.\n To add to all the lithium news and heat up the global competition for lithium resources even more, lithium prices shot way up in 2021, increasing about 240%.\n  In the years ahead, refining capacity might be built in the U.S. as more battery factories and electric vehicle factories are built here. The U.S. Department of Energy announced on Dec. 20, 2021 that 13 new electric vehicle battery factories are planned in the U.S. within the next five years. Most of these factories will be in the Southeast or Midwest.\n So, although U.S. will lag behind China, parts of the EV battery supply chain will be growing in the U.S. in the years ahead. But the question remains, how much of the lithium and other elements needed for the supply chain will come from mines in Nevada?

I wanted to make it more maintainable, so I reimplemented it as  a Limnoria plugin. Thanks to Val for the support, it was fun to write it!\n Sourcehut folks launched  an IRC bouncer service for the paying users of their software forge. One point of the endeavour is to drive improvements in the whole IRC ecosystem.\n IRC Driven, a site indexing IRC networks was relaunched. The site was originally created in 2006 and it provides statistics for a curated selection of IRC networks.\n   The IRCv3 Working Group published  a spec round-up in November 2021, including new drafts for WebSocket, Client batches, Account registration and Extended monitor. You can now  follow the WG on Fediverse.\n   Modern IRC Client Protocol received numerous additions and improvements from many contributors after Val from Limnoria was made editor. Val reports that the docs now cover nearly all meaningful parts from the RFCs.\n       Compatibility with Ergo ircd was improved, eight colour schemes were added, sixteen character set options were added to the server configuration screen and message log storage functionality was added.\n  The iOS app got smarter regarding background tasks and progress was made on the experimental support for macOS Catalyst. The Android app got support for Android 12 and improvements to stability.\n     Many of these include support for persistent history, so there is some overlap with the bouncer category.\n  Additions include handling of irc:// links, support for raw messages, /away command, progress bar for uploads, file management in frontend, IRC colours and text formatting and many UI improvements.\n  Lots of activity and two beta releases for 1.0.0. Additions include commands /whowas, /list and /away, improved /query, support for MONITOR, chghost, websocket, extended-join, account-notify, WHOX, SASL EXTERNAL, draft/extended-monitor, draft/account-registration with a UI to register and verify accounts, support for irc:// links, auto-joining channels upon reconnect and allowing bouncers to customise their shown name by setting NETWORK in ISUPPORT.\n  Public development started in April 2021. There is support for Redis as session store and an authorization middleware.\n  Version 1.6.0 was released in November. Message input box was made user-friendlier, channel list behaviour on desktop and mobile widths was improved among many other UI improvements.\n  Version 4.3.0 was released in November. New stuff during the half-year period include accessibility improvements, /umode and /kickban commands, optimised handling of modes based on ISUPPORT and better touch control support\n    Version 4.1 was released with additions such as a new editor for scripts and customisations, support for UTF8ONLY token and many plugin API and scripting improvements.\n    Versions 5.4 and 5.4.1 were released with additions such as asynchronous reconnection, improved nick highlighting, TLS improvements, convenience commands /opme, /deopme and /wii (whois with idle time) and an erc-bug command for reporting ERC bugs.\n  Version 2.16.0 was released in October with  a call for maintainers. Fixes went into mode support, URI parsing and the build system. An addon for handling notices and server notices was added and oper and whois addons were updated with expanded network and ircd support.\n  Version 9.51 was released in July adding a Strict Transport Security policy, a channel list export button and several fixes.\n  Many releases were made adding support for SASL authentication, system colour theme detection, integration with OS notifications and a redesigned headerbar.\n              Version 91.0 and multiple point releases were made. Changes include replacing image-based emoticons with Unicode and several fixes to the chat module.\n       While Irssi development has been slow, Ailin Nemui has a fork that is quite active. Improvements and fixes went into text rendering, TLS, performance of autojoin, the docs, /SERVER ADD and autocompletion among lots of maintenance work.\n  Lots of work went in the client during this period. Additions include automatically joining channels on start, more fine-grained unread/highlight state, a vertical member list on channels, improved CHATHISTORY support, showing of mode changes, support for specifying an external password command to avoid storing passwords in plaintext, /(un)ban, /kick, /invite and /query commands, implementation of away-notify, support for soju.im/bouncer-networks and showing the current channel topic at the top of the timeline.\n    Many fixes and code cleanups were made, IRCv3 cap key=val parsing was implemented, support was added for SASL PLAIN and EXTERNAL authentication and startup options were added for user mode as well as TLS and SASL.\n  /quit command was added, key bindings were made configurable and handling of text formatting (colours etc.) was improved.\n  Three releases were made with plenty of new goodies: plugin to support \u201duser is typing\u201d, all IRC capabilities enabled by default (if supported), support was added for IRCv3.2 SASL auth, message-tags and setname as well as FAIL/WARN/NOTE messages.\n    bnc help command output was improved and an internals extension was added to help debugging and development.\n    Version 0.14.0 was released on 1 Jan 2022, while it was nearly three years since the previous one, so let\u2019s celebrate it in this 2021 article. Changes in the half-year period include fixing a security issue with LDAP usernames and fixing macOS build failures.\n  A very active period for soju leading up to Sourcehut\u2019s hosted bouncer service. Support was added for PostgreSQL databases, instrumentation via Prometheus, a new \u201dserver status\u201d BouncerServ command, many new configuration options and protocol features MONITOR, WHOX, ELIST, account-notify, CHATHISTORY LATEST, draft/event-playback and draft/extended-monitor.\n     Additions include user-initiated password resets via email, implementation for draft/extended-monitor, support for SCRAM-SHA-256 SASL auth (even though  not endorsed), upgraded draft/register capability, service management files for OpenSolaris/Illumos and an s6 init script.\n  An inspircd.org/account-id tag was added for exposing immutable  account identifiers to users, connectban got delaying options and TLS received several improvements. Version 4 saw several alpha releases with additions such as /CHECK for finding users by an ident or real name mask, a regex_pcre2 module and FRHOST S2S command to change the real hostname of a remote user.\n      A tutorial for connecting servers and services was added, registration messages were made configurable, SNO_BANNED server notice mask was added and mask support was improved.\n  Version 6.0.0 was released with a redone logging system, named extended bans, implementations for MONITOR, draft/extended-monitor, invite-notify and setname, GeoIP support and configurable WHOIS output.\n      The codebase was updated to use es6 classes, a markov command to generate text via a gpt-2 based synthesiser was added and the commands received many improvements.\n   Cardinal \u2013 bot built with Twisted library with a focus on ease of development (Python)\n       Version 1.9.2 RC1 was released with full CAP 302 support, implementations for monitor, cap-notify and SASL 3.2 as well as new Tcl commands (monitor, isircbot, server list) and a new Twitch bind.\n    This bot uses  Duktape as the JavaScript engine. Many fixes were made and BSD support and POSIX conformance was improved\n  A very active half year period for this bot with additions such as a greet command, weather command changed to use OpenWeatherMap amid lots of improvements to the commands and cleanups of the codebase.\n    Hostmask parsing was improved, SQLAlchemy was removed from the dependencies and many fixes and doc improvements were made.\n    It was a veritable \u201dSummer of IRC\u201d for this bot with extensive improvements to the docs and code. Additions include a Wiktionary applet ( applets are external command line programs/scripts), a Wolfram|Alpha plugin, RunCommand plugin to run system commands (recommended to be used through locked-down factoids), a usershow command to show user metadata, GetUrl plugin to retrieve text contents of a URL and a qrpn module for evaluating expressions written in Reverse Polish notation with units.\n  A \u201dquick dirty add command\u201d module was added to teach the bot simple actions.\n  The codebase was migrated to Scala 3 and a spam-list functionality was added to the link listener.\n    UTF-8 locale is now detected on Windows, docs were expanded and many improvements were made to the platform plugins (reddit, wikipedia).\n         Qt 6 support was added, CAP 302 support was improved and capability validation can now be skipped.\n                    Functionality was added to record when a user was first seen and when they joined.\n       superseriousstats - a fast and efficient program to create statistics out of various types of IRC chat logs (PHP)\n    Public development of this bridge started in April 2021 and the first stable release was made in August. The aim is to provide a solution that is not disruptive to IRC users. Despite its young age, it has a wealth of features, good spec support and is performant with thousands of users. In addition to the bouncer mode, it offers a relaybot mode where a single authorized Matrix user manages the bot.\n  URL handling was improved and an /annoy command was added to annoy people, showing oneself as typing when they are.\n        Version 2.0.10 was released in August and changes after that include improvements to InspIRCd support.\n  Additions include configurable length for generated passwords, a fix for confirming an account that had its email changed while unconfirmed and more robust validation of nicknames and handling of SASL.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:09:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6280\u672f,technology,\u652f\u6301", "title": "IRC\u6280\u672f\u65b0\u95fb\u4ece2021\u5e74\u4e0b\u534a\u5e74", "title_en": "IRC technology news from the second half of 2021", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ilmarilauhakangas.fi/irc_technology_news_from_the_second_half_of_2021/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6280\u672f", "\u652f\u6301"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "90b7efbd950ead3de01ba7f8aef9fe02.png", "infoid": 1072476, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u514b\u670d\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u763e\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u90fd\u9519\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u81ea\u5df1\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u611f\uff08\u611f\u89c9\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7acb\u5373\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u8fdc\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u53ef\u6015\uff09\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6eda\u52a8Instagram\u9003\u907f\u5b64\u72ec\u3002\n\u662f\u5426\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6212\u70df\uff1f\u7edd\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u7b80\u5355\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u4f1a\u6c38\u8fdc\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u62c9\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u89c9\u5f97\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4ef6\u4e8b\u7684\u613f\u671b\u3002\n\u6bcf\u5929\u591a\u6b21\u9605\u8bfb\u65b0\u95fb\u5e76\u4e0d\u8ba9\u6211\u66f4\u660e\u667a - \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u66f4\u52a0\u7d27\u5f20\u3002\u6211\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u770b\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u753b\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u6709\u65f6\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u9000\u51fa\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u770b\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u6492\u8c0e\u7684\u6d88\u6781\u4e8b\u7269\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u4f60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u53ea\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u4f60\u8fc7\u53bb\u81ea\u6211\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u591a\u8352\u8c2c\u3002\n\u601d\u8003\u4f60\u4e0a\u763e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u5b83\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5e26\u7ed9\u4f60\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u6ee1\u8db3\u548c\u66f4\u52a0\u8270\u96be\u5730\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u9677\u9631\u3002\u8ba9\u4f60\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7ed3\u6676\u3002", "note_en": "There is one thing most people miss when they try to overcome their addiction. And they make it much more difficult for themselves.\n  It\u2019s about\u00a0 realizing you don\u2019t want to be doing it anymore.\n  Sure, it is but that doesn\u2019t make it a common practice because most people don\u2019t follow this path.\n   However,\u00a0 this makes them feel a constant pull towards the behavior. It\u2019s forbidden fruit, a desire that they\u2019re trying to run away from.\n It often looks like this: \u201cI should stop smoking, it\u2019s bad for me and costs me a lot of money\u201d.\n    When a bad day comes, a lot of people give up their attempt to quit and smoke again.\n    It\u2019s about realizing you don\u2019t want to be doing it anymore.\n     We often mistake instant gratification for long term satisfaction (feeling a bit better immediately but feeling terrible in the long run). E.g. Escaping loneliness by scrolling on Instagram.\n Also this is often nostalgia (remembering the good old days). The thing in the past brought us satisfaction and we remember it like that. E.g. playing old games\n Addictions often start as a way to find pleasure, but over time they turn into a form of pain avoidance. You no longer get satisfaction from indulging, you just feel psychological pain if you don\u2019t.\n However, if you realize that the addiction is ultimately empty, and doesn\u2019t really add anything good to your life, then you\u2019re on the right path.\n   Most people abandon things when they lose interest. In addictions, losing interest (seeing through the illusion) is a bit more difficult because your brain is wired towards craving the thing. The illusion makes you believe that the thing is the way to achieve satisfaction.\n If you realize that watching YouTube videos isn\u2019t fun like it used to be or you thought it was (the illusion that it is fun), it loses a lot of its appeal.\n If you see through this illusion, you don\u2019t feel the desire to do it anymore.\n Is it possible to quit without coming to this realization by yourself? Definitely, but it\u2019s simply much harder and probably less healthy because you will always feel the pull. You might always feel the desire towards the thing.\n But what if you already know the activity is bad for you, and you still do it anyway?\n       People can help you realize the reasons by showing you. People can help you label the issues the thing causes you that haven\u2019t been able to name yourself. People can give you the information (like we do in\u00a0 Reasons to stop surfing mindlessly).\n However, it\u2019s you that needs to internalize them, or even better come to your own conclusions.\n  Everyone should have their own reasons for why they don\u2019t want to do it. Generic arguments won\u2019t stand.\n  In reality, being addicted to the Internet pulled me away from real satisfaction. It actually started pulling me away from any real joy in life. I started to feel disengaged.\n I dissected my Internet behaviors and with all of them, I could logically explain why they brought me further away from satisfaction. I mistook immediate gratification for actual satisfaction.\n  Reading news multiple times per day doesn\u2019t make me more informed - it makes me more stressed. I lose the ability to see the bigger picture.\n Watching YouTube videos instead of real entertainment fills my head with the information I don\u2019t need or care about.\n Scrolling on Instagram doesn\u2019t make me more connected, on the contrary, it sometimes makes me feel lonely.\n   Often, we like to stay in denial - hiding from the hard truths. It\u2019s a way to rationalize why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. This denial protects our fragile egos.\n I deserve to have a drink or two after a long day at work.\u00a0- In reality, drinking every evening.\n I need to scroll on my phone in the morning, otherwise, I won\u2019t wake up.\u00a0- Wasting morning energy and ending up rushed/late because of it.\n  Of course, others usually notice this kind of self-deception more clearly than we do ourselves. If they care about you, they try to show you the way out of denial but we\u2019re often close-minded to their suggestions.\n Sometimes only after we quit, we start seeing the negative things we were lying about to ourselves. Only after you\u2019re further away, you can see how ridiculous were the actions of your past self.\n  Some kinds of addictions are strong. They don\u2019t let you come to this realization while you\u2019re actively engaging in the addictive behavior. Only after you quit, you come to realize how harmful they were to you and how heavily addicted you were. Often a weekend is enough to experience this.\n For example, my catalyst was traveling for a week. A few years ago, I was addicted to playing video games but when I traveled for a week and didn\u2019t have the access to playing video games, I realized how much better my life was. When I came back and felt the urge to play again, the first day I realized how it\u2019s a false promise that steers me off living a fulfilling life. The next day I quit with no regrets and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n This is why different challenges are popular because they allow people to see what life can be without addictive behavior. People mistakenly believe just abstaining is the solution but we\u2019ve covered this here already.\n   There are 2 main things you can do to come to the realization that addiction is empty of satisfaction and that you actually don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\n Reflect on the cost of the addiction. Reflect on how it\u2019s not fulfilling you at all. How you feel after you\u2019ve indulged. Pondering the personal negative effects that a specific behavior has on your life is a good initial step. Bonus points if you do this in writing.\n Abstain for a couple of days as an experiment. Remove a distracting app from your phone for a weekend. Plan a trip that will take you away from the environment that makes the addiction easy to engage in.\n Ponder your addictive behavior. Realize that it doesn\u2019t bring you the satisfaction it promised and that it\u2019s actually a trap that only makes real satisfaction and joy much harder to experience.\u00a0 Let your discontent crystallize.\n But these are only some tips. You need to come to this conclusion by yourself, we (or others) can only help you see the way.\n When you voluntarily come to the conclusion that you want to quit, the desire to engage in the problematic behavior will gradually fade away. And it\u2019s much more likely that you\u2019ll actually change.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:08:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6210\u763e,addiction,\u770b\u5230", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u60a8\u7684\u6210\u763e\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613", "title_en": "How to make quitting your addiction easier", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-make-quitting-your-addiction-easier", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6210\u763e", "addiction", "\u770b\u5230"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072475, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "......\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u91cd\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u4f20\u5947\u7684RMS\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\u3002\u4ece\u8c6a\u534e\u697c\u68af\u7684\u8c6a\u534e\u680f\u6746\u5230\u9505\u7089\u623f\u7684\u7164\u5c18\u7a7a\u6c14\uff0c\u6cf0\u5766\u5c3c\u514b\u53f7\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5979\u5f88\u591a\u6545\u4e8b\u90fd\u662f\u60a8\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\n\u76ee\u7779\u4e86\u822a\u884c\uff0c\u5fcd\u53d7\u4e86\u66fe\u7ecf\u5efa\u9020\u7684\u6700\u8c6a\u534e\u7684\u5927\u6d0b\u5212\u7ebf\u7684\u6c89\u6ca1\u3002", "note_en": "...aboard the legendary RMS Titanic recreated with unprecedented historical accuracy.

Certainly better than  C and its idiosyncrasies. Better than Python or Julia you say? In many cases yes. Certainly things like I/O are still problematic for the novice programmer in these languages. Partially it is because modern Fortran is easy to read and comprehend, which is an important factor for the individual learning to program for the first time. The idea of introductory languages is not necessarily that they are suited to commercial endeavours, but rather that they are (i) easy to implement algorithm in, (ii) readable, and (iii) do not contain things that will confuse and bewilder.\n Let\u2019s perform the simple task of calculating the distance to the horizon. The calculation is quite simple, all that is required is the height of your eye, i.e. the distance that your eyes are off the surface of the water. The formula for calculating the distance,  d, is  d=\u221a(2rh), where  r is the radius of the earth (6367.45km), and  h is the height of the object in metres (divided by 1000 to convert to km). So for an observer standing in a tower 42m above sea level, the distance to the horizon is  d=\u221a(2\u00d76367.45\u00d7(42/1000)) = 23.13km. So a program to calculate this in Fortran would look like this:\n  There is very little the novice programmer could not understand in this program \u2013 even without having any real notion of the syntax of Fortran. The terms  read and  write imply something is being input and output, the distance calculation is effectively just an equation. The only real sticking point maybe the variable declaration on the second line. The equivalent C program is somewhat more challenging.\n  Firstly it is four lines longer, and the only thing the same between the two programs is the equation. Two of the lines in the C program are taken up including libraries for I/O and math functions \u2013 which Fortran doesn\u2019t require. The  printf function deals with output, and is quasi-intuitive\u2026 the  scanf function is not at all intuitive. What about  int main(void) \u2013 muddy. What about the Python program, surely it must be better than both Fortran and C?\n  Python dispenses with the notion of defining the \u201cprogram\u201d, allowing the algorithm to take place with little fanfare\u2026 I mean it is only 4 lines. But the math library still has to be imported. The prompt for the height is combined together with reading in the value, which is nice and compact, but the user will still question what  float() is doing. And Julia?\n  It suffers from input issues as well, chomping and parsing things \u2013 things novice programmers don\u2019t care to know about. The commonality among all these programs is of course the calculation. The usability of a programming language is likely associated with how well it uses appropriate words to describe functions and actions, and uses symbols appropriately.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:07:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "fortran,easy,\u8bed\u8a00", "title": "Fortran\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60", "title_en": "Fortran is easy to learn", "transed": 1, "url": "https://craftofcoding.wordpress.com/2022/01/05/why-fortran-is-easy-to-learn/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["fortran", "easy", "\u8bed\u8a00"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d28451dd24205055e1fac71db27af2a.png", "infoid": 1072473, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Paul McBride\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u9192", "note_en": "A stoic reminder by Paul McBride", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:07:42", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6b7b\u4ea1,death,paul", "title": "\u6b7b\u4ea1\u65f6\u949f", "title_en": "Death Clock", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thedeathclock.co/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6b7b\u4ea1", "death", "paul"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "49476a1a9553abad83ee5a842550fde2.jpg", "infoid": 1072472, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u90fd\u8ba4\u4e3a\u82b1\u56ed\u662f\u9633\u5149\u707f\u70c2\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u751f\u957f\u548c\u996e\u98df\u7684\u4f5c\u7269\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5145\u5206\u7684\u9633\u5149\u6765\u8301\u58ee\u6210\u957f\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u771f\u7684\uff1a\u90a3\u4e9b\u590f\u5b63\u852c\u83dc\u852c\u83dc\u91ce\u751f\u82b1\u56ed\u4e0e\u5357\u74dc\uff0c\u9752\u8c46\u548c\u897f\u7ea2\u67ff\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u9633\u5149\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u53ef\u98df\u7528\u7684\u690d\u7269\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9634\u5f71\u4e2d\u751f\u957f\u3002\n\u6bd4\u4e0d\u662f\uff0cHostas\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u89c2\u8d4f\u54c1\u8d28\u800c\u751f\u957f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u5bbd\u9614\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590f\u672b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u53f9\u7684\u82b1\u6735\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u662f\u53ef\u98df\u7528\u7684\u690d\u7269\u3002\u518d\u6b21\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u82a6\u7b0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u51e0\u5e74\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\uff0cHosta\u82bd\uff08Driuled Leave\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e9\u6625\u6536\u83b7\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5927\u849c\u548c\uff08\u690d\u7269\u7684\uff09\u9ec4\u6cb9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u914d\u83dc\u716e\u719f\u3002\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u52a8\u7269\uff0c\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u7d20\u98df\u98df\u54c1\uff0c\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u98df\u8c31\u5185\u5bb9\u6bcf\u5929\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u8ba2\u9605\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eff\u8272\u661f\u7403\u901a\u8baf\uff01\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u88ab\u516c\u5f00\u8d44\u52a9\u7684\u8d44\u52a9\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u8bf7\u8003\u8651\u901a\u8fc7\u6350\u8d60\u652f\u6301\u6211\u4eec\uff01", "note_en": "Most of us think of gardens as sunny places, and that\u2019s likely because the crops we are accustomed to growing and eating require full sun to thrive. And, it\u2019s true: those summer veggie gardens wild with squash, green beans, and tomatoes need plenty of sunshine. However, there are many edible plants that can grow in the shade.\n For those of us  seeking to grow more of what we eat, it\u2019s important to learn the ins and outs of what we can grow in less than sun-drenched conditions. It turns out that a multitude of fruits and vegetables prefer shade, or at least dappled shade, in order to do their thing. Many of these are expensive specialty items or foods that never make it to market shelves. That means that we not only get some food but get something a little of the  eaten track.\n If experimental and adventurous, along with a sprinkling of self-sufficient, sounds like a good time, the following list of shade-tolerant produce might be just what you are looking for.\n   Every spring the forest floor is littered with the fresh sprouts of plants that have been waiting for some warmth. For those fortunate enough to be in the know, ostrich ferns put out  an abundance of edible fiddleheads (unfurled fronds) that are reminiscent of asparagus. They prefer partially shady spots and grow into beautiful, ornamental plants for the rest of the year.\n   Sometimes referred to as wild garlic,  ramps grow naturally in deciduous forests, where the soil is rich and ripe with organic matter. They are spring ephemerals and like to get the sun before the leaves have returned to the trees. Ramps take a while to get going (think a few years prior to harvest), but they are perennials that can produce tasty greens for years to come.\n   For a great edible in shady spots, such as the understory of  food forests, creeping raspberry (thimbleberry) will stay low and grow prolifically. It produces delicate fruits that are too soft for transport to market. Nevertheless, they resemble raspberries in flavor and make delicious jams. They like full shade. And, another bonus is that they are thornless.\n   Wintergreen is a low-growing evergreen that makes a beautiful groundcover with the benefit of edible berries and leaves for tea. The flavor of wintergreen is as its name suggests, both the berries and the leaves. This makes a fantastic groundcover in shady garden spots. They will tolerate some sunlight but much prefer shade.\n   More often than not, hostas are grown for their ornamental qualities. They have broad leaves and provide stunning flowers in the late summer. However,  they are also edible plants. Again, treated like asparagus, after a couple of years, hosta shoots (unfurled leaves) can be harvested in early spring and cooked as a simple side dish with garlic and (plant-based) butter.\n   A self-seeding member of the carrot family, sweet Cecily will spread readily wherever it is planted. It does best in partial shade and produces a delicious range of snacks, as well as attracts lots of pollinators. Like many wildflowers, sweet Cecily likes to be planted in the fall, and it will pop up the following spring.\n   Used for its delicious edible greens, good king henry is something found in supermarkets. It\u2019s a perennial plant that will provide food year after year. The sprouts can be treated like asparagus, the leaves like spinach, and the seeds like quinoa.\n   Anytime we can grow something vertically, even in shady spots, it means we are saving valuable growing space. Arctic Beauty Kiwi enjoys growing in partial shade. It reaches about 10-12 feet tall and produces divine fruit more akin to  hardy kiwi (smooth and green on the outside) than the fuzzy kiwis in the supermarket.\n   An understory tree native to the eastern United States,  American pawpaw is not related to the tropical papaya (sometimes called pawpaw) but rather of other tropical fruit trees: custard apple and soursop. American pawpaws produce delicious fruits that have a soft, pudding texture when ready to eat.\n   Elderberry trees are voracious, fast growers that thrive in sodden soil and partial shade. The berries and flowers are both medicinal and edible. The berries are general used for making jam, syrup, and wine. The flowers can be used for teas. The easy-growing trees can be chopped back if they get too large, and they recover to continue producing.\n What amazing thing to do! Grow lots of food in places most gardeners assume are a no-plant land. Not the case at all. Lots of good eats will grow where the sun rarely shows.\n   For more Animal, Earth, Life, Vegan Food, Health, and Recipe content published daily, subscribe to the\u00a0   One Green Planet Newsletter !

"note_en": "In this chapter we\u2019ll acquaint you with some of the unique properties of the Forth language. After a few introductory pages we\u2019ll have you sitting at a Forth terminal.\n   Imagine that you\u2019re an office manager and you\u2019ve just hired a new, eager assistant. On the first day, you teach the assistant the proper format for typing correspondence. (The assistant already knows how to type.) By the end of the day, all you have to do is say \u201cPlease type this.\u201d\n On the second day, you explain the filing system. It takes all morning to explain where everything goes, but by the afternoon all you have to say is \u201cPlease file this.\u201d\n By the end of the week, you can communicate in a kind of shorthand, where \u201cPlease send this letter\u201d means \u201cType it, get me to sign it, photocopy it, file the copy, and mail the original.\u201d Both you and your assistant are free to carry out your business more pleasantly and efficiently.\n  group related tasks together in larger tasks and give each of these a name, and so on.\n Forth lets you organize your own procedures and communicate them to a computer in just this way (except you don\u2019t have to say \u201cplease\u201d).\n As an example, imagine a microprocessor-controlled washing machine programmed in Forth. The ultimate command in your example is named WASHER. Here is the definition of WASHER, as written in Forth:\n  In Forth, the colon indicates the beginning of a new definition. The first word after the colon, WASHER, is the name of the new procedure. The remaining words, WASH, SPIN, RINSE and SPIN, comprise the \u201cdefinition\u201d of the new procedure. Finally, the semicolon indicates the end of the definition.\n  Each of the words comprising the definition of WASHER has already been defined in our washing-machine application. For example, let\u2019s look at our definition of RINSE:\n  As you can see, the definition of RINSE consists of a group of words: FILL, AGITATE, and DRAIN. Once again, each of these words has been already defined elsewhere in our washing-machine application. The definition of FILL might be:\n  In this definition we are referring to  things (faucets) as well as  actions (open and close). The word TILL-FULL has been defined to create a \u201cdelay-loop\u201d which does nothing but mark time until the water-level switch has been activated, indicating that the tub is full.\n If we were to trace these definitions back, we would eventually find that they are all defined in terms of a group of very useful commands that form the basis of all Forth systems. For example, a complete ANS Forth with all extensions includes 371 such commands. Many of these commands are themselves \u201ccolon definitions\u201d just like our example words; others are defined directly in the machine language of the particular computer. In Forth, a defined command is called a \u201c word.\u201d\n The ability to define a word in terms of other words is called \u201cextensibility.\u201d Extensibility leads to a style of programming that is extremely simple, naturally well-organized, and as powerful as you want it to be.\n Whether your application runs an assembly line, acquires data for a scientific environment, maintains a business application, or plays a game, you can create your own \u201cliving language\u201d of words that relate to your particular need.\n In this book we\u2019ll cover the most useful of the standard Forth commands.\n   One of Forth\u2019s many unique features is that it lets you \u201c execute\u201d a word by simply naming the word. If you\u2019re working at a terminal keyboard, this can be as simple as typing in the word and pressing the RETURN key.\n  Of course, you can also use the same word in the definition of any other word, simply by putting its name in the definition.\n Forth is called an \u201cinteractive\u201d language because it carries out your commands the instant that you enter them.\n We\u2019re going to give an example that you can try yourself, showing the process of combining simple commands into more powerful commands. We\u2019ll use some simple Forth words that control your terminal screen. But first, let\u2019s get acquainted with the mechanics of \u201ctalking\u201d to Forth through your terminal\u2019s keyboard.\n Take a seat at your real or imaginary Forth terminal. We\u2019ll assume that someone has been kind enough to set everything up for you, or that you have followed all the instructions given for loading Forth on your particular computer.\n     The RETURN key is your way of telling Forth to acknowledge your request. The  ok is Forth\u2019s way of saying that it\u2019s done everything you asked it to do without any hangups. In this case, you didn\u2019t ask it to do anything, so Forth obediently did nothing and said  ok.\n   If you make a typing mistake, you can correct it by hitting the  \u201cbackspace\u201d key. Back up to the mistake, enter the correct letter, and continue. When you have typed the line correctly, press the RETURN key. (Once you press RETURN, it\u2019s too late to correct the line.)\n In this book, we use the symbol \u21b5 to mark the point where you must press the RETURN key. We also formatted the computer\u2019s output like this (even though the computer does not) to indicate who is typing what.\n   As soon as you pressed the return key, Forth printed fifteen blank spaces and then, having processed your request, responded ok (at the end of the fifteenth space).\n   The phrase \u201c42 EMIT\u201d tells Forth to print an asterisk (we\u2019ll discuss this command later on in the book.) Here Forth printed an asterisk, then responded ok. (The ASCII code for asterisk is 42. Get out your  ASCII table\u00a0if you don\u2019t believe me.)\n   This time Forth printed fifteen spaces and two asterisks. A note about entering words and/or numbers: we can separate them from another by as many spaces as we want for clarity. But they must be separated by  at least one space for Forth to be able to recognize them as words and/or numbers.\n   over and over, let\u2019s define it as a word called \u201cSTAR.\u201d Enter this:\n  Here STAR is the name; \u201c42 EMIT\u201d is the definition. Notice that we set off the colon and semicolon from adjacent words with a space. Also, to make Forth definitions easy for human beings to read, we conventionally separate the name of the definition from its contents with three spaces.\n After you have entered the above definitions and pressed RETURN, Forth responds ok, signifying that it has recognized your definition and will remember it. Now enter\n   There is no difference between a word such as STAR that you define yourself and a word such as EMIT that is already defined. In this book, however, we will print those words that are already defined in this format, so that you can more easily tell the difference.\n Another system-defined word is CR, which performs a  carriage return and line feed at your terminal. For example, enter this:\n  As you can see, Forth executed a carriage return, then printed ok (on the next line).\n        Our MARGIN STAR combination will be useful for what we intend to do, so let\u2019s define\n  We will also need to print a a horizontal row of stars. So let\u2019s enter the following definition (we\u2019ll explain how it works in a later chapter):\n       We will need a word which performs MARGIN, then prints five stars. Let\u2019s define it like this:\n    and get a letter \u201cF\u201d (for Forth) made up of stars. It should look like this:\n  The final step is to make this new procedure a word. Let\u2019s call the word \u201cF\u201d:\n  You\u2019ve just seen an example of the way simple Forth commands can become a foundation for more complex commands. A Forth application, when listed, consists of a series of increasingly powerful definitions rather than a sequence of instructions to be executed in order.\n To give you a sample of what a Forth application really looks like, here\u2019s a listing of our experimental application:\n ( Large letter F ) : STAR 42 EMIT ; : STARS 0 DO STAR LOOP ; : MARGIN CR 30 SPACES ; : BLIP MARGIN STAR ; : BAR MARGIN 5 STARS ; : F BAR BLIP BAR BLIP BLIP CR ;\n   Each word and its definition are entered into Forth\u2019s \u201cdictionary.\u201d The dictionary already contained many words when you started, but your own words are now in the dictionary as well.\n When you define a new word, Forth translates your definition into dictionary form and writes the entry in the dictionary. This process is called  \u201ccompiling.\u201d\n    the compiler compiles the new definition (it does the same as 42 EMIT but uses [CHAR] to compile the literal value for asterisk) into the dictionary. The compiler does  not print the asterisk.\n Once a word is in the dictionary, how is it executed? Let\u2019s say you enter the following line directly at your terminal (not inside a definition):\n   This will activate a word called INTERPRET, also known as the \u201ctext interpreter.\u201d The text interpreter scans the input stream, looking for strings of characters separated by spaces. When a string is found, it is looked up in the dictionary.\n If the word is in the dictionary, it is pointed out to a word called EXECUTE. EXECUTE executes the definition (in this case an asterisk is printed). Finally, the interpreter says everything\u2019s \u201cok.\u201d\n   If the interpreter cannot find the string in the dictionary, he calls the number-runner (called NUMBER). NUMBER knows a number when he sees one. If NUMBER finds a number, he runs it off to a temporary storage location for numbers.\n  What happens when you try to execute a word that is not in the dictionary? Enter this and see what happens:\n  When the text interpreter cannot find XLERB in the dictionary, it tries to pass it off on NUMBER. NUMBER shines it on. Then the interpreter returns the string to you with a question mark (Some Forths print various error messages along with this.)\n  ANS Forth allows up to thirty-one characters of a name to be stored in the dictionary. A name should contain only graphic characters.\n To summarize: when you type a pre-defined word at the terminal, it gets interpreted and then executed.\n Now remember we said that : is a word? When you type the word :, as in\n    The text interpreter finds the colon in the input stream, and points it out to EXECUTE. The compiler translates the definition into dictionary form and writes it in the dictionary. When the compiler gets to the semicolon, he stops, and execution returns to the text interpreter, who gives the message  ok.\n   Say What? In Forth, a word is a character or group of characters that have a definition. Almost any character can be used in naming a word. The reasons that some of the control characters cannot be used are:\n  Here is a Forth word whose name consists of two punctuation marks. The word is .\u201d and it is pronounced \u201cdot-quote.\u201d You can use .\u201d inside a definition to type a string of text at your terminal. Here\u2019s an example:\n  We\u2019ve just defined a word called GREET. Its definition consists of just one Forth word, .\u201d, followed by the text that we want typed. The quotation mark at the  end of the text will not be typed; it marks the end of the text. It\u2019s called a \u201cdelimiter.\u201d\n When entering the definition of GREET, don\u2019t forget the closing ; to end the definition.\n    A computer would not be much good if it couldn\u2019t do arithmetic. If you never studied computers before, it may seem pretty amazing that a computer (or even a pocket calculator) can do arithmetic at all. We can\u2019t cite all the mechanics in this book, but believe us, it\u2019s not a miracle.\n In general, computers perform their operations by breaking everything they do into ridiculously tiny pieces of information and ridiculously easy things to do. To you and me, \u201c3 + 4\u201d is just \u201c7,\u201d without even thinking. To a computer, \u201c3 + 4\u201d is actually a very long list of things to do and remember.\n Without getting too specific, let\u2019s say you have a pocket calculator which expects its buttons to be pushed in this order:\n  in order to perform the addition and display the result. Here\u2019s a generalized picture of what might occur:\n         \u2014 the calculator performs the operation that is stored in the \u201cNext Operation\u201d Box on the contents of the number boxes and leaves the result in Box A.\n Many calculators and computers approach arithmetic problems in a way similar to what we\u2019ve just described. You may not be aware of it, but these machines are actually storing numbers in various locations and then performing operations on them.\n In Forth, there is  one central location where numbers are temporarily stored before being operated on. That location is called the \u201cstack.\u201d Numbers are \u201cpushed onto the stack,\u201d and  then operations work on the numbers on the stack.\n The best way to explain the stack is to illustrate it. If you enter the following line at your terminal:\n    Recall that when you enter a number at your terminal, the text interpreter hands it over to NUMBER, who runs it to some location. That location, it can now be told, is the stack. In short, when you enter the number three from the terminal, you push it onto the stack.\n  Now the four goes onto the \u201ctop\u201d of the stack and pushes the three downward.\n   The next word in the input stream  can be found in the dictionary. + has been previously defined to \u201ctake the top two numbers off the stack, add them, and push the result back onto the stack.\u201d\n  The next word, ., is also found in the dictionary. It has been previously defined to take the number off the stack and print it at the terminal.\n       Forth uses \u201cpostfix\u201d notation (so called because the operator is affixed  after the numbers) rather than \u201cinfix\u201d notation (so called because the operator is affixed  in-between the numbers) so that all words which \u201cneed\u201d numbers can get them from the  stack.\n  even the word STARS, which we defined ourselves, gets a number from the stack and prints that many stars.\n When  all operators are defined to work on the values that are already on the stack, interaction between many operations remains simple even when the program gets complex.\n Earlier we pointed out that Forth lets you execute a word in either of two ways: by simply naming it, or by putting it in the definition of another word and naming  that word. Postfix is part of what makes this possible.\n Just as an example, let\u2019s suppose we wanted a word that will always add the number 4 to whatever number is on the stack (for no other purpose than to illustrate our point). Let\u2019s call the word\n        The \u201c4\u201d  inside the definition goes onto the stack, just as it would if it were outside a definition. Then the + adds the two numbers on the stack. Since + always works on the stack, it doesn\u2019t care that the \u201c4\u201d came from inside the definition and the three from outside.\n As we begin to give some more complicated examples, the value of the stack and of postfix arithmetic will become increasingly apparent to you. The more operators that are involved, the more important it is that they all be able to \u201ccommunicate\u201d with each other.\n  We\u2019ve just begun to demonstrate the philosophy behind the stack and postfix notation. Before we continue, however, let\u2019s look more closely at the stack in action and get accustomed to its peculiarities.\n Forth\u2019s stack is described as a \u201clast-in, first-out\u201d (LIFO). You can see from the earlier illustration why this is so. The three was pushed onto the stack first, then the four pushed on top of it. Later the adding machine took the four off first because it was on top. Hence \u201clast-in, first-out.\u201d\n In general, the only accessible value at any given time is the top value. Let\u2019s use another operation, the . to further demonstrate. Remember that each . removes one number from the stack and prints it. Four dots, therefore, remove four numbers and print them.\n    For input, the rightmost value on the screen will end up on the  top of the stack.\n For output, the rightmost value on the screen came from the  bottom of the stack.\n     Each  dot removes one value. The fourth dot found that there was no value left on the stack to send to the terminal, and it told you so.\n  This error is called \u201cstack underflow.\u201d (Notice that a stack underflow is  not \u201cok.\u201d)\n The opposite condition, when the stack completely fills up, is called \u201cstack overflow.\u201d The stack is so deep, however, that this condition should never occur except when you\u2019ve done something terribly wrong.\n It\u2019s important to keep track of new words\u2019 \u201cstack effects\u201d; that is, the sort of numbers a word needs to have on the stack before you execute it, and the sort of numbers it will leave on the stack afterwards.\n If you maintain a list of your newly created words with their meanings as you go, you or anyone else can easily understand the word\u2019s operations. In Forth, such a list is called a \u201cglossary.\u201d\n To communicate stack effects in a visual way, Forth programmers conventionally use a special stack notation in their glossaries or tables of words. We\u2019re introducing the stack notation now so that you\u2019ll have it under your belt when you begin the next chapter.\n    The dash separates the things that should be on the stack (before you execute the word) from the things that will be left there afterwards. For example, here\u2019s the stack notation for the word .:\n  (The letter \u201cn\u201d stands for \u201cnumber.\u201d) This shows that . expects one number on the stack (before) and leaves  no number on the stack (after).\n    When there is more than one n, we number them n1, n2, n3, etc., consecutively. The numbers 1 and 2 do  not refer to a position on the stack. Stack position is indicated by the order in which the items are written; the  rightmost item on either side of the dashes\u00a0is the  topmost item on the stack. For example, in the stack notation of +, the n2 is on top:\n Since you probably have the hang of it, we may sometimes leave out the \u21b5 symbol. You can usually tell where to press \u201creturn\u201d because the computer\u2019s response is always formatted  like this.\n   Here\u2019s a list of the Forth words you\u2019ve learned so far, including their stack notations (\u201cn\u201d stands for number; \u201cc\u201d stands for character):\n Creates a new definition with the name  xxx and consisting of word or words  yyy.\n  In the next chapter we\u2019ll talk about getting the computer to perform some fancier arithmetic.\n  to generate a dictionary entry in computer memory from source text (the written-out form of a definition). Distinct from \u201cexecute.\u201d\n  in Forth, a list of words and definitions including both \u201csystem\u201d definitions (pre-defined) and \u201cuser\u201d definitions (which you invent). A dictionary resides in computer memory in compiled form.\n  to perform. Specifically, to execute a word is to perform the operations specified in the compiled definition of the word.\n  a characteristic of a computer language which allows a programmer to add new features or modify existing ones.\n  a list of words defined in Forth, showing their stack effects and an explanation of what they do, which serves as a reference for programmers.\n  the method of writing operators between the operands they affect, as in \u201c2 + 5.\u201d\n  the text to be read by the text interpreter. This may be text that you have just typed in at your terminal, or it may be text that is stored on disk.\n  (when referring to Forth\u2019s text interpreter) to read the input stream, then to find each word in the dictionary or, failing that, to convert it to a number.\n  (last-in, first-out) the type of stack which Forth uses. A can of tennis balls is a LIFO structure; the last ball you drop in is the one you must remove first.\n  the method of writing operators after the operands they affect, as in \u201c2 5 +\u201d for \u201c2 + 5.\u201d Also known as Reverse Polish Notation.\n  in Forth, a region of memory which is controlled in such a way that data can be stored or removed in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) fashion.\n  the error condition that occurs when the entire area of memory allowed for the stack is completely filled with data.\n  the error condition that occurs when an operation expects a value on the stack, but there is no valid data on the stack.\n      Define a word called GIFT which, when executed, will type out the name of some gift. For example, you might try:\n  Now define a word called GIVER which will print out a person\u2019s first name.
