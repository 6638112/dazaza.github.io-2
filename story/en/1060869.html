But as we rode into the Mojave desert on the morning of 12 December 2018, he was feeling upbeat and untroubled by the past. He wore jeans, a leather jacket and the easy smile of someone used to being behind schedule.</p><p>   riceard branson迟到了近15年。但随着我们在2018年12月12日上午骑入莫哈韦沙漠，过去他过去感到乐观，不受影响。他穿着牛仔裤，一件皮夹克，曾经曾经落后的时间表的人的轻松微笑。</p><p> Branson hadn’t exactly squandered the past 15 years. He’d become a grandfather, moved to a private island in the Caribbean and expanded Virgin’s business empire into banking, hotels, gyms, wedding dresses and more. But he was staking his legacy on  Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company he formed in 2004. The idea was to build a rocketship with seats for eight – two pilots, six passengers – that would be carried aloft by a mothership, released about 45,000ft in the air and then zoom just beyond the lower limit of space, float around for a few minutes, before returning to Earth. He was charging $200,000 a seat.</p><p> 布兰森过去15年没有完全挥霍。他成为一个祖父，搬到加勒比地区的私人岛屿，并将维尔京的业务帝国扩展到银行，酒店，健身房，婚纱等等。但他在2004年形成的空间旅游公司举行了遗产。这个想法是建立一个八二飞行员的座位的座位，六名乘客（六位乘客）（六位乘客）将被母亲举行约45,000英尺在空中然后缩放超出空间的下限，漂浮在返回地球之前几分钟。他正在收取20万美元的座位。</p><p>  It did not initially seem like such a crazy idea. That year, a boutique aviation firm in Mojave, California, two hours north of Los Angeles, had built a prototype mothership and rocketship that a pair of test pilots flew to space three times, becoming the first privately built space craft. Branson hired the firm to design, build and test him a bigger version of the craft.</p><p>  它并没有最初看起来像这样一个疯狂的想法。那一年，加利福尼亚州莫哈韦的一家精品航空公司，洛杉矶北部两个小时建造了一个原型母舰和火箭队，一对试用飞行员飞到空间三次，成为第一个私下建造的空间工艺。布兰森聘请了坚定的设计，建造和测试他是一个更大版本的工艺。</p><p> But the undertaking was proving far more difficult than Branson anticipated. An accidental explosion in 2007 killed three engineers. A mid-air accident in 2014 destroyed the ship and killed a test pilot, forcing  Virgin Galactic to more or less start over.</p><p> 但是，企业证明远远超过布兰森预期。 2007年的意外爆炸造成三名工程师。 2014年的中航事故摧毁了船舶并杀死了一名试验试验，迫使原始银河迫使初步或更少。</p><p>  I approached the company shortly after the accident to ask if I could embed with them and write a story about their space programme for  the   New Yorker. I worked on the story for four years. After it came out, in August 2018, I spent another two years reporting and writing a book about the test pilots who fly Branson’s spaceship.</p><p>  事故发生后我很快就会审议公司，询问我是否可以嵌入他们并向纽约人撰写有关他们的空间计划的故事。我在这个故事上工作了四年。在它出来后，2018年8月，我花了另外两年的报告并写了一本关于飞行布兰森飞船的试飞者的书。</p><p> Amid the tragedies and setbacks, Branson remained optimistic of the prospect of imminent success. In 2004: “It is envisaged that Virgin Galactic will open for business by the beginning of 2005 and, subject to the necessary safety and regulatory approvals, begin operating flights from 2007.” Then, in 2009: “I’m very confident that we should be able to meet 2011.” Later, in 2017: “We are hopefully about three months before we are in space, maybe six months before I’m in space.”</p><p> 在悲剧和挫折之中，布兰森仍然乐观，即将取得成功的前景。 2004年：“设想，维尔京银河将于2005年初开展业务，而须遵守必要的安全和监管批准，从2007年开始运营航班。”然后，在2009年：“我非常有信心我们应该能够见到2011年。”后来，在2017年：“我们希望在我们空间中大约三个月，也许在我在太空之前六个月。” </p><p> Meanwhile, other private space companies, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, were making progress. Branson confessed that had he known in 2004 what he knew now, “I wouldn’t have gone ahead with the project… We simply couldn’t afford it.”</p><p>与此同时，其他私人空间公司，例如elon麝香的太空缆索和杰夫贝斯的蓝色起源正在取得进展。布兰森承认，他在2004年他知道他现在知道的东西，“我不会继续这个项目......我们根本无法负担得起。”</p><p> His record on delivering promises has made him a polarising figure. Branson has appeared on lists of both hucksters and heroes. One poll ranked him second among people whom British children should emulate; Jesus Christ came third. His biographer describes him as “a card player with a weak hand who plays to strength,” but also a “self-made and self-deprecating man whose flamboyance endears him to aspiring tycoons, who snap up his books and flock to his lectures to glean the secrets of fortune-hunting.”</p><p> 他在提供承诺的记录使他成为了一个偏振图。布兰森出现在Hucksters和英雄的名单上。一项民意调查将英国儿童效仿的人排名第二;耶稣基督来了第三。他的生物学家将他描述为“带有力量弱手的卡片球员”，也是一个“自制和自我贬低的人，其华丽的人厌恶他向渴望自己的书籍和羊群抓住他的讲座收集幸运的秘密。“</p><p> But all of that was in the past; the turmoil and hardship would hopefully make the triumph all that much sweeter. For he and I knew as we headed into the desert that tomorrow could finally be the day that Virgin Galactic went to space.</p><p> 但所有这些都在过去;有动荡和困难希望让胜利的胜利。因为他和我知道，当我们走进沙漠时，明天可能终于可以成为处女银河到太空的那一天。</p><p>  Branson was all smiles as we arrived at our destination north of the airport in Mojave, an expansive, Asimovian facility where Branson’s other space company, Virgin Orbit, tests rockets and where Branson was about to be given a special tour. He listened to the engineers’ canned deliveries, but did not ask about cryogenics or flow rates or other technical details.</p><p>  布兰森一切都笑了，因为我们到达了莫哈维机场北部的目的地，这是一家宽敞的asimovian设施，布兰森的其他空间公司，维珍轨道，测试火箭以及布兰森即将获得特别旅游。他听着工程师的罐头交付，但没有询问低温或流量率或其他技术细节。</p><p> That was not his gift. His gift was knowing what people like. Branson is a tastemaker, a marketing genius. He spruces up airplanes, trains, hotels and gyms, rebrands them as his own – and moves on. He knows when to get in and get out: he earned a reported £200m when he sold his stake in Virgin Media, for instance, and another £230m when he sold his stake in Virgin Active. He does not typically make stuff. Yet here he was in the business of making spacecraft.</p><p> 那不是他的礼物。他的礼物是了解人们喜欢的东西。布兰森是一个品尝者，一个营销天才。他弥补了飞机，火车，酒店和健身房，以自己的方式重塑它们 - 并继续前进。他知道何时进入并出去：当他在野生媒体销售他的股份时，他赚了200万英镑，而他在处女活跃的股份卖出他的股份。他通常不会制作东西。然而，在这里，他在制作宇宙飞船的业务中。</p><p> This brought particular challenges. For one, US law prohibits citizens from sharing technical details with foreigners, even if those foreigners own the company. When Branson asked a rocket question, an engineer responded with silence. “It’s because I’m British, isn’t it?” Branson said, betraying a hint of frustration.</p><p> 这带来了特别的挑战。对于一个，美国法律禁止公民与外国人分享技术细节，即使这些外国人拥有公司。当布兰森问火箭问题时，工程师沉默地回应了。 “这是因为我是英国人，不是吗？”布兰森说，背叛了一丝挫折感。</p><p>  Later in the tour, we visited a test pad where engineers were bent over intricate foil-wrapped tubes, hoses and piping, preparing to conduct a ground test. Branson asked how many more ground tests they intended to conduct and when they could launch an aerial test. Every day they were testing meant another day they weren’t making money.</p><p>  在旅游之后，我们访问了一个测试垫，工程师弯曲复杂的箔包裹的管，软管和管道，准备进行地面测试。布兰森询问他们打算进行更多的地面测试，并且当他们能够发射空中测试时。每天他们都在测试意味着另一天他们没有赚钱。 </p><p>   It all started for Branson with the Sex Pistols. In December 1976, the punk band went on a primetime talkshow where the guitarist called the host a “dirty fucker” on air, bringing the segment to an abrupt end. Venues cancelled the band’s upcoming gigs. Their record label dropped them.</p><p>这一切都开始了与sex pistols的branson。 1976年12月，朋克乐队继续了一个原始的谈判，吉他手在空气中称为主持人“肮脏的笨蛋”，将细分带到突然结束。场地取消了乐队即将到来的演出。他们的记录标签掉了下来。</p><p> Branson was a 26-year-old music producer. He saw an opportunity and signed the band to his label. Five months later, when the Sex Pistols released God Save the Queen, a mockery of the royal Silver Jubilee, the BBC refused to play the single. Branson responded by chartering a boat and setting up a stage on deck. They sailed up the Thames, in front of parliament, while the band played God Save the Queen. Police boarded the boat and shut down the concert.</p><p> 布兰森是一个26岁的音乐制片人。他看到了机会并向他的标签签了乐队。五个月后，当Sex Pistols发布上帝拯救女王时，皇家银禧嘲笑，BBC拒绝玩单身。布兰森通过租船并在甲板上设立舞台来回应。他们在议会面前航行了泰晤士河，而乐队则拯救了女王。警察登机船并关闭音乐会。</p><p> God Save the Queen jumped to No 2 in the charts. But the stunt was equally important for Branson; it established his rebel reputation, one he has nurtured ever since: “I won’t let silly rules stop me.” He branched into other sectors. Before long, Virgin had its own line of soft drinks, trains, wedding dresses, limousines, wines, airlines, casinos, and condoms.</p><p> 上帝拯救女王在图表中跳到2号。但是特技表达对布兰森同样重要;它建立了他的叛逆声誉，他有史以来一直培养：“我不会让愚蠢的规则阻止我。”他分手进入其他部门。在长期以来，Virgin有自己的软饮料，火车，婚纱，豪华轿车，葡萄酒，航空公司，赌场和避孕套。</p><p> Virgin’s formula is Branson’s adventuresome brand. He has promoted soda from the top of a tank in Times Square and dangled naked from a crane with only a mobile phone covering his privates to advertise that Virgin Mobile had “nothing to hide” on its bills. He has flown hot-air balloons across oceans and set speedboat records. Along the way, he has survived some close calls – like when his boat capsized in a nasty storm, or when he was attempting to sail across the Atlantic, through the Bermuda Triangle, when the mainsail ripped and forced him to turn back. (He promised, “We will build another boat and try again!”)</p><p> 维珍的公式是布兰森的冒险品牌。他从时代广场的坦克顶部促进了苏打水，只有一名手机挂着裸体，覆盖着他的私人，以宣传维珍移动在其账单上有“无所畏惧”。他在海洋中飞行了热气球并设置了快艇记录。一路上，他幸存了一些接近的呼唤 - 就像他的船在一个令人讨厌的风暴中倾覆，或者当他试图穿过大西洋航行时，通过百慕大三角帆，当主帆撕裂并迫使他转回。 （他承诺，“我们将建造另一艘船并再试一次！”）</p><p> He is accustomed to handling setbacks with a smile. This has proven particularly useful at Virgin Galactic, where the company has not provided what it promised, but somehow continues to sell promise.</p><p> 他习惯于微笑处理挫折。这已证明在维尔京银河系中特别有用，公司未提供它所承诺的内容，但不知何故继续销售承诺。</p><p> At the February 2016 rollout for SpaceShipTwo in Mojave, a reporter asked Branson about Virgin Galactic’s longer-term ambitions. Branson said that flying people to space was “pretty cool”, but, “Once you’ve got people into space, why shouldn’t we have point-to-point travel at tremendous speeds? And why shouldn’t we go on creating an orbital vehicle? We will start to do that. I just had a meeting with a senator, talking about asteroids. And they asked, ‘Can Virgin Galactic come up with ideas to try to remove giant asteroids coming toward the Earth?’ We’ll have a look at that. And, ‘Could Virgin Galactic help sort out the debris in space?’ We’ll have a look at that, too. And once all that’s sorted we’d like to join the race for deep-space exploration.”</p><p> 2016年2月推出莫哈韦斯的Spaceshiptwo，记者问布兰森关于处女银河的长期野心。布兰森说，飞往太空的人是“很酷”，但是，一旦你有人进入太空，为什么我们不应该以巨大的速度进行点对点旅行？为什么我们不应该继续创造一个轨道车辆？我们将开始这样做。我刚与参议员开会，谈论小行星。他们问道，“维尔京银河可以想出想法，以试图去除巨大的小行星到地球的巨大小行星？”我们会看看那个。而且，“圣母银河系”可以帮助整理空间的碎片？“我们也看看那个。一旦所有这些都是他们想加入竞争的深空探索。“</p><p> Virgin Galactic’s president, Mike Moses, sat nearby, and, speaking after Branson, stressed how an experimental rocketship programme required “evolutionary steps” that were gradual, deliberate and realistic.</p><p> 维尔京银河总统迈克摩西附近坐在附近，并在布兰森发言，强调了如何逐渐，故意和现实的“进化步骤”所需的实验火箭计划。 </p><p>  “One of the things I hate is the world judging us based on what our marketing has said in terms of our readiness to fly and the depth of our knowledge,” Moses once told me.</p><p>“我讨厌的一件事就是根据我们的营销在我们准备好飞行和知识的深度来说所说的世界来判断我们，”摩西曾告诉我。</p><p> Branson knows that people snigger. “It would be embarrassing if someone went back over the last 13 years and wrote down all my quotes about when I thought we would be in space,” he told me.</p><p> 布兰森知道人们嗤之以鼻。 “如果有人在过去的13年里回来并写下我的所有报价，那么当我认为我们会在太空时，就会令人尴尬，”他告诉我。</p><p> But he is uniquely unfazed by embarrassment. He stutters when he speaks without notes. He shares unflattering details about his sex life, like his “bizarre sexual allergy” to his first wife. “Whenever we made love a painful rash spread across me which would take about three weeks to heal,” he once wrote. “We went to a number of doctors, but we never resolved the problem. I even had a circumcision to try to stop the reaction.”</p><p> 但他是独特的尴尬所展望。如果没有笔记，他就会陷入困境。他分享了对他的性生活的细节，就像他对他的第一任妻子的“奇怪的性过敏”一样。 “每当我们做爱时，痛苦的皮疹都会在我身上蔓延，这将需要大约三个星期来治愈，”他曾经写过。 “我们去了一些医生，但我们从未解决过这个问题。我甚至有一个割礼来试图阻止反应。“</p><p> Somehow it added to his charm. A couple years ago, I contacted him and asked if I could visit him in the British Virgin Islands to discuss the programme. He extended a personal invitation. I booked plane tickets, while his assistant arranged a speedboat transfer and asked if I had any dietary restrictions. “So I can let our chefs know in advance,” she said. But on the eve of my trip, Branson’s advisers found out what was happening and revoked the invitation. Branson had apparently made plans without consulting his communications director.</p><p> 不知怎的，它增加了他的魅力。几年前，我联系了他，问我是否可以在英属维尔京群岛拜访他，讨论该计划。他延长了个人邀请。我预订了机票，而他的助手安排了快艇转移，并询问我是否有任何饮食限制。 “所以我可以让我们的厨师提前了解，”她说。但在我的旅行前夕，布兰森的顾问发现了发生的事情并撤销了邀请。不咨询他的通信总监，布兰森显然是制定的计划。</p><p> At the time, I saw it as proof of Branson’s swashbuckling insouciance: he could live that persona and let others protect him from himself. Perhaps I should have seen it as another empty promise.</p><p> 当时，我认为它是布兰森的武装的证据：他可以生活这个角色，让别人保护他自己。也许我应该看到它作为另一个空的承诺。</p><p> The day after we drove into the desert, Branson stepped on to a stage beside the runway. Behind him, Virgin Galactic’s mothership, with SpaceShipTwo fixed to its belly, was preparing to takeoff. Branson welcomed the select crowd. “I’m not allowed to say it, but hopefully we’re going to space today!” he said. “Hopefully we’ll have some magic in the next couple of hours.” An hour later, Branson was squinting against the sun, tracking SpaceShipTwo’s contrails across the blue morning sky.</p><p> 在我们开车进入沙漠之后的第二天，布兰森踏上了跑道旁边的舞台。在他身后，维尔京银河系的母舰有太空飞船修理到腹部，正准备起飞。布兰森欢迎选择人群。 “我不被允许说，但希望我们今天要去太空！”他说。 “希望我们在接下来的几个小时里有一些魔法。”一个小时后，布兰森在阳光下眯着眼睛，追踪Spaceshiptwo在蓝天的晨天天空中的凝结。</p><p> Space travel has been a longtime obsession of his. He once produced a documentary to commemorate the moon landing, featuring ambient soundscapes, a psychedelic montage of telescope images and clips of John F Kennedy’s “moon shot” speech. Later, when Branson appeared on the BBC’s  Going Live!, a viewer called in and asked if he’d contemplated any extraterrestrial ventures. “I’d love to go into space,” said Branson. “If you’re building a spacecraft, I’d love to come with you.”</p><p> 太空旅行一直是他的长期痴迷。他曾经制作过纪念月亮登陆的纪录片，包括环境Soundscapes，望远镜图像的迷幻蒙太奇和John F Kennedy的“月亮射击”演讲。后来，当布兰森出现在BBC的生活中！，一个呼吁的观众并询问他是否已经考虑过任何外星企业。 “我很想进入太空，”布兰森说。 “如果你正在建造宇宙飞船，我很想和你一起去。” </p><p>  Accounts from astronauts further fuelled Branson’s fascination. Weightlessness sounded positively bananas to him – having to Velcro everything down so that it didn’t float away; being able to pitch a bread roll at your tablemate without worrying it would end up falling on to a dirty floor.</p><p>宇航员的账户进一步推动了布兰森的魅力。失重对他来说令人妥善的香蕉 - 不得不让一切都贬低，以便它没有漂浮;能够在你的小片状物中倾斜面包卷而不担心它将最终落在肮脏的地板上。</p><p> But what moved Branson most was how astronauts described the transformative power of it all, its almost baptismal nature. “Once people have gone to space they come back with renewed enthusiasm to try and tackle what is happening on this planet,” he told me. He regarded space travel as a humanistic, rather than an escapist, venture. And now, suddenly, it seemed possible that he could offer that experience to the masses.</p><p> 但是，移动的布兰森最是宇航员如何描述它的变革能力，它几乎是洗礼性质。 “一旦人们去了太空，他们会随着更新的热情而回去尝试解决这个星球正在发生的事情，”他告诉我。他认为太空旅行是一种人文，而不是逃避福利风险。现在，突然间，他似乎可以为群众提供这种经验。</p><p> He watched the flight from the foot of the stage while an engineer stood at the mic, relaying updates from mission control. They had to get above 264,000ft, or 50 miles, which the US government defines as the boundary of space.</p><p> 他从舞台的脚下看了飞机，而工程师站在麦克风，从任务控制中断更新。他们必须超过264,000英尺或50英里，美国政府定义为空间的边界。</p><p>          Up in the cockpit the pilot Mark Stucky said: “Great motor burn, everybody! We’re going to space, Richard!”</p><p>          在驾驶舱里，飞行员马克斯蒂说：“大摩托车，大家！我们要去太空，理查德！“</p><p>   Branson covered his face with both hands, cratering with emotion. His son Sam stood next to him and put his hand on his father’s back. “That was the definition of a picture telling a thousand words, a thousand sleepless nights,” Sam told me. Later, Branson held an impromptu press conference. He burned easily in the sun so he found a sliver of shade behind a trailer and reporters crowded in.</p><p>   布兰森用双手捂住脸，用情感播出。他的儿子山姆站在他旁边，把手放在父亲的背上。 “这是一张图片的定义告诉千言万语，一千个不眠之夜，”萨姆告诉我。后来，布兰森举行了一个即兴新闻发布会。他很容易在阳光下烧毁，所以他发现了一块拖车后面的阴影，记者拥挤。</p><p> Mike Moses hung near the back, but within earshot. Branson declared that SpaceShipTwo could be done with its flight-test programme in as little as three months.</p><p> 迈克摩西挂在后面，但在耳朵里。布兰森宣布，Spaceshiptwo可以在三个月内使用其飞行测试计划完成。</p><p> As yet, they have only returned to space once and are still testing. A temporary stall? Or have the costs of this undertaking finally caught up with Branson?</p><p> 尚于，它们只返回到空间一次并且仍在测试。一个临时的摊位？或者这项承诺的成本终于赶上了布兰森？ </p><p> I am no longer embedded with the company, but stay in touch with people there. I know that two years ago the vice-president of safety resigned because of safety concerns, and that a December 2020 flight was aborted in midair. (In a statement, a Virgin Galactic spokesperson said, “We feel confident about our space operations, which are regulated by the FAA office of commercial spaceflight transportation. Flight test programmes are an iterative process with safety as the first priority and it is well known that we have overcome a variety of technical challenges over the past 15 years. Our safety culture is built around the principle that everyone in the company has the ability to call attention to an issue.” They added: “As we are still in the flight test phase of the programme, we continue to analyse, inspect and modify the vehicles as necessary, and we are on track to conduct our next spaceflight in May.”) I also know, from public information, that while Virgin Galactic’s space programme may be struggling, its bottom line seems strong. In late 2019, Virgin Galactic became a publicly traded company: at one point the stock was trading at almost five times its initial price offering.
