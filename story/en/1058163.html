Initial reports said there was no harm to the Natanz facility, but Iranian officials later acknowledged damage to its centrifuges.</p><p> 政府官员和新闻报道给出了造成最新爆炸，损害程度和伊朗迅速恢复的能力的冲突账户。初步报告称，北非士州设施没有伤害，但伊朗官员后来承认对其离心数的损害。</p><p>  And while media accounts have suggested saboteurs focused on taking out the facility’s electric supply, David Albright, founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., believes the aim was to destroy centrifuges. Power is easy to restore even when electrical equipment is damaged, allowing enrichment work to quickly resume. But an abrupt blackout that also takes out backup power would have destroyed some centrifuges, Albright says, since they need to be powered down slowly. Failure to do so leads to vibrations that can cause centrifuge rotors and bellows to become damaged and in some cases disintegrate, which is what Albright suspects occurred.</p><p>  虽然媒体账户建议破坏破坏者，但是在华盛顿州华盛顿州的科学和国际安全研究所的大卫奥尔布赖特，大卫·奥尔布赖特，大卫·奥尔布赖特和国际安全院长，认为，目的是摧毁离心者。即使电气设备损坏，电源易于恢复，允许丰富的工作迅速恢复。但是突然停电也拿出了备用电源会摧毁一些离心者，因为他们需要缓慢下来。未能这样做导致振动可能导致离心转子和波纹管损坏，在某些情况下崩解，这就是奥尔布赖特嫌疑人发生的事情。</p><p> Below is a summary of what we currently know and don’t know about the incident at Natanz.</p><p> 以下是我们目前了解的摘要，并不了解Natanz的事件。</p><p>  On Sunday, news organizations reported an electrical blackout at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant, located in the desert about 155 miles south of Tehran. Natanz is critical to Iran’s nuclear program. The heavily secured site is protected by anti-aircraft guns and has two large centrifuge halls buried more than 50 feet underground to protect them from airstrikes. Despite the conflicting reports, it appears the facility’s main power distribution equipment — Natanz has its own grid — was taken out with explosives.  Backup emergency electricity also was taken down, and power cut out across the multibuilding compound, Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesperson for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, told Iran’s state-run TV.</p><p>  在星期天，新闻机构报告了Natanz铀浓缩厂的电子停电，位于德黑兰南部约155英里的沙漠中。 Natanz对伊朗的核计划至关重要。严重固定的部位受防空枪保护，并有两个大型离心机埋设地下超过50英尺的地下，以保护它们免受空袭。尽管报告有冲突，但它看起来似乎设施的主要配电设备 - 纳塔斯有自己的网格 - 被爆炸物带出来。备用应急电力也被删除，而电力削减了伊朗原子能组织发言人的多元化复合，Behrouz Kamalvandi，告诉伊朗的国有电视。</p><p> Iranian officials initially said there were no casualties or damage to facilities. But Kamalvandi later conceded that the “small explosion” had “damaged sectors [which] can be quickly repaired.” Kamalvandi was speaking from  a hospital bed, however, because he had fallen down a 20-foot hole while visiting Natanz after the attack, breaking an ankle and gashing his head. This would suggest that the explosions may have done extensive ground or structural damage.</p><p> 伊朗官员最初表示，设施没有伤亡或损害。但Kamalvandi后来承认，“小爆炸”有“损坏的部门”可以快速修复。“ Kamalvandi正在从医院床上发表讲话，因为他在攻击后访问Natanz时落下了一个20英尺的洞，打破了脚踝并撕裂了他的头。这表明爆炸可能已经进行了广泛的地面或结构损伤。</p><p> “This tells me that the damage must be quite a lot in some spots,” says Olli Heinonen, former deputy director of the Safeguards Division of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Organization and currently a Distinguished Fellow with the Stimson Center in Washington, DC. “Nuclear installations normally are very safe. There are no open places where you can go down 7 meters just like that. So probably he went to some area that is damaged, and that is a bad sign.”</p><p> “这告诉我，在联合国国际原子能组织保障部门司司长副主任奥尔利海努恩说，造成的损害必须是相当多的，”联合国国际原子能组织的保障部门司司长，目前与华盛顿特派团，DC的Stimson中心杰出的别人。 “核设施通常非常安全。没有开放的地方，你可以像那样下来7米。所以，他可能已经去了一些损坏的区域，这是一个糟糕的迹象。“ </p><p> Reports have indicated that the sabotage set Iran’s uranium enrichment program back nine months. See “How Quickly Can Iran Recover?” below.</p><p>报告表明，破产区将伊朗的铀浓缩计划设定为九个月。请参阅“伊朗可以恢复速度？”以下。</p><p>  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif blamed the incident on Israeli sabotage, calling it a “terrorist attack” and “nuclear terrorism.” Both U.S. and Israeli sources have told Western reporters that Israel was indeed behind the attack. Though Israel has not formally taken responsibility for the operation, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces seemed to hint at Israel’s involvement during a speech on Sunday at a ceremony for Israeli soldiers.</p><p>  伊朗外交部长穆罕默德Javad Zarif归咎于以色列破坏事件，称之为“恐怖袭击”和“核恐怖主义”。美国和以色列消息人士都告诉西方记者，以色列确实遭到袭击。虽然以色列没有正式对该行动负责，但以色列国防军的员工主任Aviv Kohavi，似乎在以色列在以色列士兵举行的仪式上演讲时暗示了以色列参与。</p><p> “The IDF’s actions throughout the Middle East are not hidden from our enemies’ vision, who are observing us, seeing our capabilities and carefully considering their next steps,” he said. “By virtue of clever operational activities, the past year was one of the most secure years that the citizens of the State of Israel have known. We will continue to act, combining power and discretion, determination and responsibility — all of this to guarantee the security of the State of Israel.”</p><p> “IDF在整个中东的行动并没有隐藏在我们的敌人的愿景中，他们正在观察我们，看到我们的能力，并仔细考虑他们的下一步，”他说。 “凭借聪明的业务活动，过去一年是以色列国家公民所知的最安全的年份之一。我们将继续采取行动，结合权力和自由裁量权，决心和责任 - 所有这一切都可以保证以色列州的安全性。“</p><p> Israel has the most to fear from a nuclear-armed neighbor. Although Iran has long insisted that its controversial nuclear program is peaceful and not a weapons program, the U.S. intelligence community found that Iran did have a nuclear weapons program until 2003, when it halted the program following the U.S.-coalition invasion of Iraq. And although Israel has its own nuclear program, it has worked hard to prevent its close neighbors from developing one as well.</p><p> 以色列对核武器邻居的恐惧最多。虽然伊朗长期以来，其争议的核计划是和平，而不是武器计划，美国情报界发现伊朗在2003年之前有核武器计划，当它在美国联盟入侵伊拉克后停止了该计划。虽然以色列有自己的核计划，但它努力防止其亲密的邻居也发展。</p><p> Israel has a long history of sabotaging nuclear facilities in Iraq, Syria, and Iran, both through cyber means — including the sophisticated Stuxnet attack against Iran, which Israel conducted with U.S. and  Dutch intelligence agencies — and with conventional bombs and explosives. Israel is also reportedly behind a number of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists and officials over the last decade. The Stuxnet attack was particularly significant because it launched the era of cyberwarfare, as it was the first cyberattack known to use a digital weapon that could leap into the physical realm to cause actual destruction of equipment. The highly skilled covert operation was conducted in lieu of a kinetic attack to avoid attribution and an escalation in hostilities with Iran; it remained undetected for three years.</p><p> 以色列在伊拉克，叙利亚和伊朗破坏核设施历史悠久，包括网络手段 - 包括对伊朗的复杂的斯法克网攻击，以色列与美国和荷兰情报机构进行的，以及传统的炸弹和炸药。据报道，以色列也在过去十年中担任伊朗核科学家和官员的许多暗杀。 Stuxnet攻击特别重要，因为它推出了Cyber​​warfare的时代，因为它是第一个使用能够跳跃到物理领域的数字武器来引起设备的实际破坏。通过动力学攻击进行高技能的隐蔽操作，以避免伊朗敌对行动的归因和升级;它仍然未被发现三年。</p><p>  The sabotage on Sunday seemed timed to send a message — both to Iran and to the U.S. and Europe. It occurred just days after talks began in Vienna to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement that the Obama administration had worked hard to broker with Iran to control its uranium enrichment production. The Trump administration, urged on by Israel, unilaterally  withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed  sanctions on Iran.</p><p>  Sabotage在星期天似乎定时发送消息 - 既是伊朗和美国和欧洲。它发生在谈判在维也纳开始恢复2015年核协议的日子，奥巴马政府努力经纪人与伊朗努力控制其铀浓缩生产。特朗普政府，以色列敦促以色列，从2018年的交易中撤回并对伊朗实施制裁。</p><p> The sabotage also occurred the same day U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Tel Aviv to drum up support for reviving that agreement with Iran. Albright believes it was designed to telegraph to the U.S. that Israel won’t support restoring the old agreement and has no problem scuttling them in order to keep Iran’s nuclear program in check.</p><p> 破坏也发生在同一天美国国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀访问了特拉维夫，鼓励支持与伊朗恢复该协议。奥尔布赖特认为，它旨在电报到美国。以色列将无法支持恢复旧协议，并没有问题，以便将伊朗的核计划保持检查。 </p><p> The timing of the sabotage was also significant for another reason. The day before the Natanz incident, Iran celebrated National Nuclear Technology Day, an annual event marking the nation’s atomic advances. To mark the event and send a message to its negotiating partners, technicians at Natanz began to operate a small batch of IR-6 centrifuges as well. The majority of centrifuges at Natanz are a model known as IR-1, which is much less efficient at enriching uranium than the IR-6 design. The nuclear agreement signed with Iran in 2015 (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) limited it to using only IR-1 centrifuges, so the installation of the IR-6s is widely seen as a provocation designed to give Iran leverage in the revived talks. To add to the tension, Iran has been enriching uranium gas to  20 percent since the Trump administration withdrew from the agreement two years ago. Prior to this, it was enriching uranium to 3 to 5 percent. The higher levels put Iran closer to the 90 percent enrichment that is needed for nuclear weapons, all of which raises the stakes for Israel.</p><p>由于另一个原因，破坏的时间也很重要。在纳塔斯事件前一天，伊朗庆祝国家核技术日，一年一度的赛事标志着国家的原子进步。要标记活动并向其谈判伙伴发送信息，Natanz的技术人员也开始运营一小批IR-6离心机。 Natanz的大多数离心者是称为IR-1的型号，在富含IR-6设计时，富含铀的效率远低得多。与伊朗签署的核协议于2015年（称为联合综合行动计划，或JCPOA）仅限于仅使用IR-1离心机，因此IR-6S的安装被广泛被视为旨在让伊朗杠杆杠杆的挑衅在复活的会谈中。为了增加张力，自特朗普政府两年前从协议退出以来，伊朗一直在富含铀天然气至20％。在此之前，它富含铀至3％至5％。较高的水平使伊朗更接近核武器所需的90％的浓缩，所有这些都会引发以色列的股权。</p><p>  Israeli media, among the first to report on the incident, said the sabotage was caused by a  cyberattack, though no details have been reported to support this, and  other reports have said the sabotage was caused by explosives. It is possible to produce physical explosions through a cyber assault, however. In 2007, the U.S. Energy Department’s Idaho National Laboratory demonstrated that it was possible to physically destroy a 27-ton electrical generator using nothing more than 21 lines of malicious code, in what is known as the  Aurora Generator Test.</p><p>  以色列媒体中，第一个报告事件的报告称，破坏是由网络攻击引起的，但没有据报道过滤这一点，而其他报告则表示破坏是由爆炸物造成的。然而，可以通过网络攻击产生物理爆炸。 2007年，美国能源部的爱达荷州国家实验室表明，在称为极光发电机测试中，只有超过21行的恶意代码才能摧毁27吨发电机。</p><p> The use of explosives at Natanz doesn’t rule out the possibility that the sabotage involved a hybrid attack with explosives taking out the main power distribution equipment and malicious code taking out the emergency backup power supply to manipulate the frequency converters that control the speed at which the centrifuges spin.</p><p> 在Natanz的爆炸物的使用并不排除破坏涉及用爆炸物涉及混合攻击所取出的主要配电设备和恶意代码，从而耗尽紧急备用电源来操纵控制速度的变频器离心机旋转。</p><p> It will take days or weeks before we have a clear understanding of what the attack entailed and how the perpetrators pulled it off, but if an outside generator or transformer was destroyed by explosives, this should become apparent in satellite images that will no doubt be available in the next day or so, Albright said.</p><p> 在我们有明确的了解攻击以及犯罪者如何将其拉下来，但如果外部发电机或变压器被爆炸物摧毁，这应该在卫星图像中变得显而易见，这将在卫星图像中变得显而易见在第二天左右，奥尔布赖特说。</p><p>  Although the attack targeted the electric distribution at Natanz, the real target was likely the centrifuges. Centrifuges spin in excess of 100,000 revolutions per minute and as noted above, need to be slowed gradually, otherwise they vibrate dangerously, and the rotors and bellows inside can be destroyed.</p><p>  虽然攻击针对Natanz的电力分布，但实际目标可能是离心机。离心机旋转超过每分钟100,000转旋转，如上所述，需要逐渐减慢，否则它们危险地振动，并且内部的转子和波纹管可以被破坏。</p><p> One reason Iranian officials may have changed their story about the damage at Natanz, initially claiming there was none but later conceding centrifuge damage, is that damage to a centrifuge is generally internal and can’t be seen until technicians remove its outer aluminum casing.</p><p> 伊朗官员可能已经改变了他们对娜坦斯损坏的故事的一个原因，最初声称没有稍后的离心机损坏，这是对离心机的损坏一般是内部的，直到技术人员去除其外铝套管之前就无法看到。</p><p> On Monday, the day after the sabotage, Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, said some parts of the enrichment facility are now running on emergency backup electricity, but he didn’t say if this included the centrifuges.</p><p> 星期一，伊朗原子能组织负责人阿里阿克巴·萨利希（Ali Akbar Salehi）表示，富集设施的一些部分现已在紧急备用电力上运行，但如果这包括离心，他就没有说。 </p><p> Albright says that to slow down the centrifuges, the sabotage would have needed to target the frequency converters, which are power supplies that regulate the flow of energy to the centrifuges and their speed. To affect these converters, the attackers would have needed to take out the emergency backup power supply, “which is deep inside the plant,” he said.</p><p>奥尔布赖特说，为了减慢离心机，遗传需要瞄准变频器，这些变频器是调节能量流向离心机的电源及其速度。为了影响这些转换器，攻击者需要采取紧急备用电源，“在工厂内部深入”，“他说。</p><p> “The emergency system will come on as soon as the outside power will stop, and that will run for quite a while and that will keep the centrifuges spinning,” Albright said. “But if you can take out the main power supply and the emergency system, then you can stop the centrifuges.”</p><p> “一旦外面的电力停止，紧急系统将会出现，这将运行很长一段时间，这将保持离心机旋转，”奥布莱特说。 “但如果您可以取出主电源和紧急系统，那么您可以停止离心机。”</p><p> The frequency converters, notably, were  also the target of Stuxnet in 2009 and 2010. The malicious Stuxnet code caused the converters to increase and decrease the speed of the centrifuges for timed periods in order to destroy their motors and bellows and spoil the uranium gas inside the centrifuges. The computer systems controlling the frequency converters at Natanz are not connected to the internet, so in that attack, the perpetrators snuck the first version of Stuxnet into the facility on a USB stick carried in with a  mole working for Dutch intelligence. Subsequent versions were delivered to Natanz computers by infecting the laptops of outside engineers who worked at the plant and who then unwittingly carried Stuxnet into Natanz on their computers.,</p><p> 值得注意的是，频率转换器也是2009年和2010年的STUXNET的目标。恶意Stuxnet代码导致转换器增加并降低离心机的速度，以便破坏其电动机和波纹管并破坏内部的铀气体离心机。控制Natanz的频率转换器的计算机系统未连接到Internet，因此在该攻击中，肇事者将第一个版本的StuxNet置于带有用于荷兰智力的鼹鼠携带的USB棒上的设施。随后的版本通过传染在工厂工作的外部工程师的笔记本电脑，然后将斯坦特人无意中携带到他们的计算机上的Natanz。，</p><p> Although Iran has been testing a number of different models of centrifuge at Natanz, the vast majority of centrifuges there are IR-1s. Iran has 6,000 of these at Natanz and over the last five months has also installed 1,000  IR-2m centrifuges. Salehi told Iranian news media that the only centrifuges damaged in Sunday’s attack were IR-1s: the same centrifuge model that Stuxnet targeted a decade ago.</p><p> 虽然伊朗一直在纳坦斯在纳坦斯进行了一些不同型号的离心机，但绝大多数离心机都有IR-1。伊朗在纳塔尼茨拥有6,000人，过去五个月也安装了1000名IR-2M离心机。 Salehi告诉伊朗新闻媒体，周日攻击中唯一损坏的离心机是IR-1S：斯坦特网在十年前定位的相同的离心模型。</p><p> IR-1 centrifuges are very difficult to stop when they are spinning at full speed, Albright says.</p><p> Albright说，IR-1离心机在全速旋转时非常难以停止。</p><p> “It requires slowing down the speed, stopping, and waiting for the centrifuge to stabilize [at several stages]. If you don’t do that, then the centrifuge can just crash. At a certain speed of revolutions, they will start to shake like a  vibrating string.”</p><p> “它需要放慢速度，停止和等待离心机来稳定[几个阶段]。如果你不这样做，那么离心机可以崩溃。在一定的革命速度下，他们将开始像振动的弦一样摇晃。“</p><p> Without pauses to stabilize, the vibrations will increase, causing the rotor inside to scrape the side of the aluminum casing, which is just a few millimeters away from the rotor, and destroy the rotor and internal casing.</p><p> 在没有暂停稳定的情况下，振动将增加，导致转子内部刮铝壳的侧面，这只距离转子几毫米，并破坏转子和内壳。 </p><p> “It will be like shrapnel going off, and you’ll hear it break,” Albright said. “They would hear it all through the plant if these things are breaking.”</p><p>“就像弹片一样走了，你会听到它的休息，”奥尔布赖特说。 “如果这些事情破坏，他们会通过工厂听到它。”</p><p>  It remains to be seen how long it will take Iran to recover. News reports have said the sabotage set the program back nine months. Salehi has said, “Enrichment in Natanz has not stopped and is moving forward vigorously.”</p><p>  伊朗恢复需要多长时间才能看到。新闻报道已表示破坏计划九个月后计划。 Salehi曾说过，“Natanz的丰富尚未停止，正在蓬勃发展。”</p><p> Heinonen, the former U.N. atomic safeguards official, says it would not take nine months just to replace a destroyed transformer or generator and the destroyed centrifuges.</p><p> 前U.N.原子保障官员的海军说，替代摧毁的变压器或发电机和被摧毁的离心机将不会花费九个月。</p><p> “If you need to replace the transformer or the electric supply, that may take some time; it’s not something you take from the shelf. It’s custom-designed for the purpose,” he said. But it would take only a few weeks to replace it.</p><p> “如果您需要更换变压器或电源，可能需要一些时间;这不是你从货架上取的东西。这是为目的定制的设计，“他说。但这只需要几周时间来取代它。</p><p> He says the issue is likely that Iran will have to rebuild entire cascades; cascades are clusters of centrifuges joined by pipes that carry uranium gas from one to the next as it goes through stages of enrichment. If shrapnel and metal dust created by the rotor scraping the casing got into the piping, that would all have to be replaced.</p><p> 他说这个问题很可能是伊朗必须重建整个瀑布;瀑布是由管道加入的离心机簇，这些管道将铀气体从一个到另一个到另一个到另一个到另一个人的级数。如果由转子刮擦壳体的转子和金属粉尘进入管道，那将是必须更换的。</p><p> “[That dust] probably will break additional centrifuges,” he said. “To replace a centrifuge, you need to clean the whole mess, including the cascade piping. If there are small pieces here and there, it’s very difficult to clean such small pipes, so you have to replace them. That is a very time-consuming operation.”</p><p> “[灰尘]可能会打破额外的离心机，”他说。 “要更换离心机，您需要清洁整个混乱，包括级联管道。如果这里有小块，那么清洁这些小管道很困难，所以你必须更换它们。这是一个非常耗时的操作。“</p><p> If the frequency converters were damaged as well, then this will add to the recovery time. The devices are tailor-made, and Heinonen said it’s not clear how many Iran has in stock.</p><p> 如果变频器也损坏，那么这将增加恢复时间。这些设备是量身定制的，海伦森表示，这并不清楚有多少伊朗有多少库存。 </p><p> Heinonen said Iran can recover more quickly by simply abandoning the affected cascades and centrifuges and building new cascades in an empty corner of the hall, and installing IR-2m centrifuges that are more efficient than the damaged IR-1s. If Iran has everything it needs for this, it will take six months to rebuild, he said. Not only will Iran be up and running by the end of summer, it will have a more efficient operation.</p><p>Heinonen说，伊朗通过简单地放弃受影响的瀑布和离心机并在大厅的空角落中建造新的瀑布，并安装比损坏的IR-1更有效的IR-2M离心机，可以更快地恢复。他说，如果伊朗拥有它所需的一切，因此需要六个月的时间来预测。伊朗不仅将在夏季结束时跑，它将具有更有效的操作。</p><p> With 1,500 IR-2m centrifuges, “you are actually exactly where you were last week in terms of enrichment capacity, because these are four times more powerful than the IR-1s,” he said. “So I would install them and show to the world that [they] are back in business, and that will take a few months, provided that the electricity is there.”</p><p> 凭借1,500个IR-2M离心机，“实际上，您实际上是您上周在富集能力方面的位置，因为这些是比IR-1S更强大的四倍，”他说。 “所以我会安装它们并向世界展示[他们]回归业务，这将需要几个月，只要电力就在那里。”</p><p> This appears to be what Iran is planning to do, not only to recover from the sabotage but also to secure a stronger bargaining position in its nuclear negotiations. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, has stated, “Natanz will be stronger than ever with more advanced machines, and if they think our hand in negotiation is weak, this act will strengthen our position in the negotiations.”</p><p> 这似乎是伊朗计划做的事情，不仅要从破坏中恢复，而且还可以在其核谈判中获得更强大的讨价还价。 Zarif，伊朗外交部长陈述了，“Natanz比以往任何时候都更加先进的机器，如果他们认为我们的谈判弱势，这一行为将加强我们在谈判中的立场。”</p><p>  An Iranian official announced on Tuesday that Iran will  begin to enrich uranium to 60 percent in response to the attack on Natanz. Whether Iran is just using this to gain leverage in the Vienna talks is unclear. But if the enrichment plan proceeds, it would put Iran closer to having weapons-grade uranium than it has ever been, introducing a new level of destabilization in the Middle East.</p><p>  周二伊朗官员宣布，伊朗将开始富含铀以回应对Natanz的袭击。伊朗是否只是使用这是在维也纳会谈中获得杠杆率尚不清楚。但是，如果浓缩计划收益，它将让伊朗更接近武器级铀而不是曾经过的铀，引入了中东地区的新稳定化水平。</p><p> Iran is also under pressure from lawmakers in Tehran to halt the nuclear talks in Vienna. “Talks under pressure have no meaning,” Abbas Moghtadaie, deputy chair of the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy committee, said in a Clubhouse talk on Monday,  according to the New York Times.</p><p> 伊朗也受到德黑兰立法者的压力，以停止维也纳的核会谈。纽约时报的说法，“伊朗议会国家安全和外交政策委员会的副主席Abbas Moghtadaie”下，压力下没有任何意义。</p><p> In addition, Iran has vowed to get revenge for the sabotage. It’s unclear whether this will involve cyberattacks against Israel — similar to attacks that were launched against Israel’s  water supply following the previous sabotage at Natanz last July — or include a kinetic response, such as rockets launched across Israel’s northern border by Iran-backed Hezbollah. Whatever the retaliation, it will likely escalate further response from Israel.</p><p> 此外，伊朗发誓要报复破坏。目前尚不清楚这是否将涉及对以色列的网络攻击 - 类似于以色列在去年7月之前破坏的塔内斯在以色列的破坏之后推出的攻击 - 或者包括动力学反应，例如在以色列的伊朗支持的真主党在以色列的北部边界推出的火箭。无论报复什么，它可能会升级来自以色列的进一步反应。</p><p> Regardless of what Iran does to retaliate, it’s clear that attacks against Iran’s nuclear program won’t end, says Albright.</p><p> 无论伊朗是否要报复，奥尔布赖特都明确了对伊朗核计划的攻击不会结束。 </p><p> “The Israelis … want to make the point that this isn’t simply about going back to the [old agreement with Iran]. The fact that the U.S. secretary of defense was there when it happened is a pretty strong signal to the U.S. and Europe that JCPOA … is not going to cut it [going forward].”</p><p>“以色列人......想让这不仅仅是关于回到[伊朗旧协议]。美国国防部长发生的事实是对美国和欧洲的一个非常强大的信号，JCPOA ......不会削减它[前进]。“</p><p> Wait!
