I eventually want to try being blind for a week, but I’ll need seven days with no other obligations, and I won’t have that for a while. For now, I’ll suffice with a smaller-scale experiments with a few extra provisions for added difficulty.</p><p>在24小时内，我将在我的公寓里失明，孤身一人。我最终想试着失明一周，但我需要七天的时间，没有其他的义务，而且我暂时不会有这样的经历。就目前而言，我只需要做一些小规模的实验就足够了，另外还有一些额外的规定，以增加难度。</p><p>  I must leave my blindfold on for 24 hours. If the blindfold falls off or I can get partial sight, I have failed the experiment.</p><p>我必须24小时戴着眼罩。如果眼罩掉了，或者我的视力不全，我的实验就失败了。</p><p>  I will set an alarm for 24 hours. I cannot set any other alarms or use any other means to ascertain the time. It is up to me to keep my phone charged so the alarm goes off.</p><p>我会把闹钟设为24小时。我不能设置任何其他闹钟或使用任何其他方法来确定时间。让我的手机充电是我的责任，这样闹钟就会响。</p><p>    I have no good reason. I just want to see if I am capable of doing it and what will happen. Some things I’m curious about:</p><p>我没有很好的理由。我只是想看看我是否有能力做到这一点，以及会发生什么。有几件事我很好奇：</p><p> Will I be able to stave off boredom with podcasts, audiobooks, and music on my phone?</p><p>我能通过手机上的播客、有声读物和音乐来打发无聊吗？</p><p> Will I enter some sort of meditative state due to a lack of sensory input?</p><p>我会因为缺乏感官输入而进入某种冥想状态吗？</p><p>     Will I eat? Is consuming caffeine a good idea (for entertainment) or a bad idea (energy with no direction)?</p><p>我要吃东西吗？摄入咖啡因是一个好主意(娱乐)还是坏主意(没有方向的能量)？</p><p> Will this experience make me more interested in being blind for a week? Or less?</p><p>这段经历会让我对失明一周更感兴趣吗？还是更少？</p><p>   Attempt One started at 10:30 AM and failed at 1:13 PM. I purposefully took off my blindfold because I was worried that my multiple failures to input my Iphone’s password had resulted in a permanent lock or data wipe. But the password screen was just locked for a minute and all was well.</p><p>尝试一开始于上午10：30，下午1：13失败。我故意摘下了我的眼罩，因为我担心我多次输入iPhone密码的失败会导致永久锁定或数据擦除。但密码屏幕只被锁定了一分钟，一切都很正常。</p><p> Given that I failed in the early afternoon, I considered restarting the experiment on another day in the morning. But I had already carved out a 24 hour period when I wouldn’t do any work or be disturbed, and it might have been a week or two longer before I got that opportunity again.</p><p>考虑到我在下午早些时候失败了，我考虑在另一天早上重新开始实验。但我已经有了24小时的时间，在这段时间里，我不会做任何工作，也不会被打扰，可能还需要一两个星期才能再次获得这个机会。</p><p>    Attempt Two was successful. I put on my blindfold at 1:23 PM on Thursday, November 5, 2020. I removed it at 1:28 PM on Friday, November 6.</p><p>第二次尝试成功了。2020年11月5日星期四下午1点23分，我戴上了眼罩。我在11月6日星期五下午1点28分把它移走了。</p><p> It was an… interesting experience. I don’t recommend it, but I’m glad I did it. I’m not sure where to begin in describing it, especially since I couldn’t take notes, and part of the challenge was being confused. But I’ll do my best to break down the experience.</p><p>那是一辆…。有趣的经历。我不推荐，但我很高兴我这么做了。我不知道从哪里开始描述它，特别是因为我不能做笔记，而且部分挑战是被弄糊涂了。但我会尽我最大努力打破这段经历。</p><p>   To simulate blindness, I used a dark blue scarf as a blindfold. One layer wasn’t quite dark enough, so I folded it in half for extra light defense.</p><p>为了模拟失明，我用一条深蓝色围巾作为眼罩。有一层不够暗，所以我把它对折起来，以便更好地保护光线。</p><p> With the blindfold securely on, my vision was the same whether my eyes were open or closed. I kept my eyes closed 99.9% of the time since it was usually more comfortable and helped limit light. I occasionally opened my eyes to check the brightness level and to… I guess you could call it  stretch my eyelids. They don’t feel good if you leave them closed for too long.</p><p>戴上眼罩，无论眼睛是睁着还是闭着，我的视力都是一样的。我99.9%的时间都闭着眼睛，因为它通常更舒适，而且有助于限制光线。我偶尔睁开眼睛看看亮度，然后看…。我想你可以称之为拉长我的眼皮。如果你把它们关得太久，它们会感觉不舒服。</p><p> I couldn’t get a perfect scarf seal around my eyes, so sometimes when I tilted my head back while sitting I noticed a little light come into the bottom of my vision. To limit this, I often pinched the scarf around my nose in that position. But many/most blind people can see some light anyway, so I don’t think this was a significant violation of the experiment.</p><p>我无法在眼睛周围围上完美的围巾，所以有时当我坐着向后仰着头的时候，我注意到有一丝光线进入了我的视线底部。为了限制这一点，我经常在那个位置捏住鼻子周围的围巾。但不管怎样，很多/大多数盲人都能看到一些光，所以我不认为这是对实验的重大违反。</p><p> My eyes got quite dry under the scarf, so I applied moisturizer to this lids and sockets four or five times. I wanted to use eyedrops too, but there was no way to do so without failing the experiment.</p><p>我的眼睛在围巾下面变得很干，所以我在这个眼睑和眼窝上涂了四五次保湿霜。我也想用眼药水，但要做到这一点，不通过实验是不可能的。</p><p>   Initially, everything was black, but as the day went on and the sun went down, I could tell it was nighttime even through two layers of scarf and my eyelids. I’m not sure if I could tell because my eyes had adjusted to become extremely sensitive to light, or if there were other subtle signals (ie. noises, air temperature, circadian rhythms, etc.) which my body picked up on. As evidence of the latter, I could not see any difference between the tv being on or off, nor the refrigerator being opened or closed, even when I was sitting right in front of either.</p><p>起初，一切都是黑色的，但随着时间的推移，太阳落山了，即使透过两层围巾和眼皮，我也能分辨出已经是晚上了。我不确定我是否能分辨出来，因为我的眼睛已经调整到对光非常敏感，或者是否有其他微妙的信号(即。噪音、气温、昼夜节律等)。我的身体也注意到了这一点。作为后者的证据，我看不出电视是开着还是关着，冰箱是开着还是关着的，即使我就坐在这两个人的前面。</p><p> What I saw depended on how I applied my focus. If I did focus on my vision, I’d see the typical blackness you get from closing your eyes, but it was never perfectly black nor uniform; there was always some odd movement and occasional coloring (whiteness, pale blue, or sometimes red). The most common distortions were a swirling or flowing whiteness, sort of like cream in coffee. I hoped that being blindfolded for so long would make the distortions more extreme, but for the most part it looked no different than what you’d see if you closed your eyes right now for ten minutes.</p><p>我所看到的取决于我如何运用我的注意力。如果我真的专注于我的视力，我会看到你闭上眼睛得到的典型的黑色，但它从来都不是完全黑色的，也不是一成不变的；总是有一些奇怪的动作和偶尔的颜色(白色，淡蓝色，有时是红色)。最常见的扭曲是呈漩涡状或流动状的白色，有点像咖啡里的奶油。我希望被蒙住眼睛这么长时间会让扭曲变得更极端，但在很大程度上，它看起来与现在闭上眼睛10分钟所看到的没有什么不同。</p><p> There was one exception. It must have been about 20+ hours into the experiment, and my eyes were itching, so I rubbed both of them at the same time over the scarf. If you rub your closed eyes and focus on your sight any time you can see some weird stuff, but this was far more extreme than usual. I remember my entire vision filling up with white bubbles which then broke and briefly returned to black. Then white lightning bolt shapes stretched across my sight, expanded to make my vision purely white, and then slowly faded back to black. The strangest thing about it was the  brightness. I literally felt like I was staring into lights despite being blindfolded in a dark room. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 30 seconds, but my heart was racing.</p><p>有一个例外。实验大概进行了20多个小时，我的眼睛发痒，所以我同时在围巾上摩擦了两只眼睛。如果你在任何时候揉揉闭上的眼睛，专注于你的视力，你就会看到一些奇怪的东西，但这比平时要极端得多。我记得我的整个视觉都充满了白色的气泡，然后这些气泡破裂了，短暂地回到了黑色。然后，白色的闪电形状延伸到我的视线上，扩大到让我的视线变得纯白，然后慢慢地淡出到黑色。最奇怪的是它的亮度。尽管我在黑暗的房间里被蒙住眼睛，但我真的感觉自己在凝视着灯光。不幸的是，它只持续了大约30秒，但我的心跳得很快。</p><p> More notable than what I saw was what I didn’t see. By default, I was lost in thought and I focused on nothing. In such a state, I didn’t even register my vision or notice the darkness. I  think this made my imagination and mental visualization more acute. On occasion, I’d be deep in thought and I’d get the  brightness sensation again because I’d be mentally picturing something so vividly that the inevitable return to darkness felt like shutting off the lights in my brain. I’ll explain more about this in the  Three Phases section.</p><p>比我看到的更值得注意的是我没有看到的东西。默认情况下，我陷入沉思，什么都不关注。在这样的状态下，我甚至没有记录我的视力，也没有注意到黑暗。我想这让我的想象力和脑海中的想象更加敏锐。有时候，我会陷入沉思，我会再次感受到光明的感觉，因为我会在脑海中生动地想象一些东西，以至于不可避免地回到黑暗中，感觉就像关闭了我大脑中的灯。我将在三个阶段部分详细解释这一点。</p><p> Sadly, I did not hallucinate, or at least not as far as I could tell.</p><p>遗憾的是，我没有产生幻觉，或者至少在我所知的范围内没有。</p><p>    I read that  blind people have trouble getting to sleep because they don’t access any/enough light for their circadian rhythms. I seem to have the exact opposite problem. Without light, my body always thinks it’s time to sleep and has trouble doing anything else. Throughout most of the experiment, I felt extremely lethargic, lazy, and had to fight to stay awake.</p><p>我读到盲人很难入睡，因为他们无法接触到任何/足够的光线来调节他们的昼夜节律。我的问题似乎正好相反。没有光线，我的身体总是认为是时候睡觉了，而且做其他任何事情都有困难。在整个实验的大部分时间里，我都感到极度昏昏欲睡、懒惰，不得不努力保持清醒。</p><p> I started my first failed experiment attempt at 10:30 AM. I had gotten 7.5 solid hours of sleep, I hadn’t done anything tiring the previous day, and I generally felt fine. Then I put on my blindfold, and within thirty minutes I was nodding off. I semi-slept for two hours before deciding to get an energy drink to get myself out of the funk. That worked, but as soon as it wore off, I was back in semi-sleep mode.</p><p>上午10点半，我开始了我第一次失败的实验。我足足睡了7.5个小时，前一天也没做什么累人的事，总体感觉还好。然后我戴上眼罩，不到30分钟我就睡着了。我半睡半醒地睡了两个小时，然后决定喝杯能量饮料，让自己从恐惧中解脱出来。这招奏效了，但当它一消失，我就又回到了半睡眠状态。</p><p> Even when I was firmly awake, I generally felt weak and lethargic. Movement around the apartment was annoying of course, but made so much more difficult by my energy levels. I ended up lying perfectly still in my comfy computer chair with my feet on a table 95% of the time. That is, when I wasn’t lying in bed.</p><p>即使在我清醒的时候，我通常也会感到虚弱和昏昏欲睡。当然，在公寓里走动很烦人，但我的精力水平让我的行动变得更加困难。我最终完全静止地躺在我舒适的电脑椅上，95%的时间我的脚放在桌子上。也就是说，当我没有躺在床上的时候。</p><p> On the other hand, when I removed my blindfold after 24 hours, I experienced a  burst of energy. Seriously, it was like I had downed a double shot of espresso. It was like a switch had been flicked. The haziness and cobwebs were gone in an instant, and I felt the energy coursing through my body. I guess light has a big impact on me.</p><p>另一方面，当我在24小时后摘下眼罩时，我感受到了能量的迸发。说真的，就像我喝了两杯浓缩咖啡。就像一个开关被按了一下。迷雾和蜘蛛网瞬间消失了，我感觉到能量在我的身体里流动。我猜光线对我有很大的影响。</p><p>    For the most part, I slowly walked around my apartment with a hand out to feel for walls and edges. Sometimes I’d get lazy and crawl just so it was easier. I know my apartment well enough that it wasn’t hard to get around, but every once in awhile I’d lose track of where I was and would be left slowly swinging my arm around searching for anything. It’s not a pleasant sensation.</p><p>在很大程度上，我慢慢地在公寓里走来走去，伸出一只手去摸墙壁和边缘。有时我会变得懒惰，爬来爬去，这样更容易些。我对我的公寓非常了解，所以四处走动并不难，但偶尔我会忘记自己身在何处，只能慢慢地挥动手臂寻找任何东西。这不是一种愉快的感觉。</p><p> Before the experiment, I had planned to pace around for fun, or maybe even do some exercise with the free time. But the confusion and especially the lethargy stopped all that. I just sat in my chair and didn’t move unless I needed to get a drink, go to the bathroom, or sleep.</p><p>在实验之前，我曾计划在闲暇时间里四处走动找点乐子，或者甚至做些运动。但混乱，尤其是昏昏欲睡阻止了这一切。我只是坐在椅子上，一动不动，除非我需要喝一杯，去洗手间，或者睡觉。</p><p> I kind of wish I had done the experiment in an unfamiliar environment to add to the movement challenge, but oh well.</p><p>我有点希望我是在一个不熟悉的环境中做这个实验，以增加运动的挑战性，但是，哦，好吧。</p><p>   For food, I ate a big lunch at 10 AM before the experiment and then munched on dark chocolate throughout the night. I felt the heavy lethargy well before the lack of calories was an issue. I probably should have put some prepackaged meals in my fridge to eat, but I was worried about making a mess and not being able to clean up. Do I want ants? Because that’s how I get ants.</p><p>在食物方面，我在实验前10点吃了一顿丰盛的午餐，然后整个晚上都在大嚼黑巧克力。早在卡路里不足成为问题之前，我就感觉到了沉重的昏昏欲睡。我可能应该在冰箱里放一些预先包装好的饭菜吃，但我担心弄得一团糟，收拾不干净。我想要蚂蚁吗？因为我就是这么养蚂蚁的。</p><p> For drinks, I could manage to get to the kitchen and fill a cup with water when I needed to. I never took a full cup back to my chair just in case I knocked it over (clean up would be a nightmare). I also had some diet coke to serve as entertainment and put a little caffeine in me.</p><p>对于饮料，我可以设法去厨房，在需要的时候加满一杯水。我从来没有把满满的杯子放回椅子上，以防撞倒(清理工作将是一场噩梦)。我还喝了一些健怡可乐作为娱乐，还在身体里放了一点咖啡因。</p><p> For the bathroom, I (a man) peed sitting down. I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p><p>在洗手间，我(一个男人)坐着撒尿。我不羞于承认这一点。</p><p>   As part of the experiment, I never knew what time it was. This was intended to confuse me throughout the 24 hours, and it did, but it may have helped too. With no sense of time, it was easy to sit back and not think about it. Time drifted by and I existed. That was that.</p><p>作为实验的一部分，我从来不知道几点了。这是为了在整个24小时内迷惑我，它确实起到了作用，但它可能也起到了帮助作用。在没有时间观念的情况下，人们很容易坐下来不去想这件事。时光流逝，我存在。就是这样。</p><p> I actually did ask Siri for the time once… it was late in the experiment, and it felt like I had put on the blindfold forever ago. As you’d expect, time feels like it moves slowly when you’re blind and have little to do. I kept waiting for my alarm to go off on my phone… but it never did.</p><p>有一次，我确实问过Siri的时间，…。实验进行得太晚了，感觉好像我很久以前就戴上了眼罩。正如你所预料的那样，当你失明且无事可做时，时间会感觉流逝得很慢。我一直在等我的手机…闹钟响。但事实并非如此。</p><p> Finally, I gave up and was willing to fail a part of my challenge by asking Siri what time it was. She told me it was 1:28 PM. The alarm was already supposed to have gone off.</p><p>最后，我放弃了，并愿意通过询问Siri几点的时间来完成我的挑战的一部分。她告诉我现在是下午1点28分。警报器应该已经响了。</p><p> I figured out later that I had accidentally snoozed the alarm the instant it had gone off while blindly hitting my phone to pause a song. Thus, my failure of will occurred outside the boundaries of the experiment, and I do not consider it a disqualifying action.</p><p>后来我才发现，我是在闹钟响的那一刻不小心把闹钟弄睡了，当时我正盲目地按手机暂停一首歌。因此，我的意志失败发生在实验范围之外，我不认为这是一种取消资格的行为。</p><p>    Likewise, as far as I could tell, my other senses were not enhanced in any noticeable way, but… I did  appreciate my other senses more, and that seemed to enhance at least my enjoyment of them. I swear the dark chocolate and those diet cokes tasted better than ever. And as I’ll explain in  Three Phases, music was sometimes especially pleasurable.</p><p>同样，据我所知，我的其他感官也没有明显增强，但…。我确实更欣赏我的其他感官，这似乎至少增加了我对它们的享受。我发誓黑巧克力和健怡可乐的味道比以往任何时候都要好。正如我将分三个阶段解释的那样，音乐有时特别令人愉悦。</p><p>   As part of the rules of the experiment, I could not interact with any other people, either in person or digitally. So I ended up skirting close to two other experiments I want to do eventually:</p><p>作为实验规则的一部分，我不能与任何其他人互动，无论是面对面的还是数字的。因此，我最终避开了我最终想做的另外两个实验：</p><p>  Siri became both my best friend and worst enemy. Initially I wanted to ban Siri to make it more challenging for me, but I figured that would be too close to the “sit in a room and do nothing challenge.” Fortunately/unfortunately, dealing with Siri was enough of a challenge on its own.</p><p>Siri既是我最好的朋友，也是我最大的敌人。起初，我想禁止Siri，让它对我来说更具挑战性，但我觉得这太接近于“坐在房间里什么都不做”的挑战了。幸运/不幸的是，与Siri打交道本身就是一项挑战。</p><p> First, I wanted to listen to audiobooks. I finished the last hour of  Caesar: Life of a Colossus, and then got ready to start the next book on my Audible list, but… Siri couldn’t get me to it. I tried a dozen different voice commands. Didn’t work.</p><p>首先，我想听有声读物。我读完了《凯撒：巨人的一生》的最后一个小时，然后准备开始我可听清单上的下一本书，但是…。Siri无法让我访问它。我尝试了十几种不同的语音命令。但没有奏效。</p><p> So I moved on to podcasts. I told Siri to play my podcast app, and it booted up  a mercifully long Joe Rogan Experience episode. Then I told her to play “Sam Harris,” and that didn’t work. I told her to play “Making Sense podcast,” and that didn’t work. I tried more Joe Rogan, and that didn’t work. I switched over to Spotify, but I could only get the same Joe Rogan episode going.</p><p>所以我转向播客。我告诉Siri播放我的播客应用程序，它启动了一集相当长的乔·罗根体验(Joe Rogan Experience)。然后我让她演“山姆·哈里斯”，但没有奏效。我让她玩“有意义的播客”，但没有奏效。我试了更多的乔·罗根，但没用。我转到了Spotify，但我只能播放乔·罗根(Joe Rogan)那一集。</p><p> Fucking Siri. Or fucking me for being too stupid to use Siri properly. No… fuck her. If I can’t figure out how to get Siri to play an old podcast while I’m sitting in the dark with a blindfold on with literally nothing else to do for 24 hours, it’s Siri’s fault, not mine.</p><p>该死的Siri。或者因为我太蠢而不能正确使用Siri。没有…。去他妈的她。如果我想不出如何让Siri播放旧播客，而我却戴着眼罩坐在黑暗中24小时无事可做，那是Siri的错，不是我的错。</p><p> I resorted to music most of the time. But I’m not a music person. I never listen to music unless I’m doing something else that takes up the vast majority of my attention, like writing or playing video games. Even when I’m driving or walking around, I default to podcasts and audiobooks. But music was all I had so that’s what I listened to. Sometimes I used headphones, but that was a bit eerie late at night… I already felt pretty vulnerable sitting alone and blind in an apartment… alone, blind, and functionally deaf somehow felt even worse.</p><p>我大部分时间都求助于音乐。但我不是个音乐爱好者。我从来不听音乐，除非我在做其他能占据我大部分注意力的事情，比如写作或玩电子游戏。即使我开车或四处走动，我也会默认使用播客和有声读物。但音乐是我的全部，所以我听的就是音乐。有时我会戴上耳机，但在深夜的时候那有点诡异，…。我已经觉得很脆弱了，独自一人盲目地坐在公寓里…。孤独、失明和功能性失聪不知何故感觉更糟。</p><p> A bonus annoyance was that there was no way for me to stop my phone’s audio except to blindly press spaces where I thought the pause button might be. Finding the right spot might take two seconds, or it might take a minute. That entirely depended upon display factors over which I had no control nor knowledge given my blindness.</p><p>一个额外的烦恼是，除了盲目地按下我认为暂停键可能在的空格键之外，我没有办法停止手机的音频。找到合适的地点可能需要两秒钟，也可能需要一分钟。这完全取决于显示因素，而鉴于我的失明，我对这些因素既不能控制，也不知道。</p><p> When I periodically got bored of music, I resorted to asking Siri questions. If you ask her anything too complex, she just brings up a web browser for you, and I couldn’t see the screen, so that was useless. But at least she could tell me simple stuff, so I ended up learning a lot about the population sizes of European cities and the net worths of celebrities. Joe Biden is a lot poorer than I thought.</p><p>当我每隔一段时间对音乐感到厌倦时，我就求助于问Siri问题。如果你问她任何太复杂的问题，她只会给你调出一个网页浏览器，而我看不到屏幕，所以这是没有用的。但至少她可以告诉我一些简单的事情，所以我最终了解了欧洲城市的人口规模和名人的净资产。乔·拜登比我想象的要穷得多。</p><p> I eventually considered getting drunk, but I decided against it. The alcohol would distort the raw experimental experience too much.</p><p>我最终考虑喝醉了，但我决定不这么做。酒精会严重扭曲原始的实验体验。</p><p>   Bird Box. An obvious one, but even beyond the surface-level comparison, I genuinely feel like I  understand  Bird Box better now. It is truly  unnerving to wear a blindfold all the time. You feel vulnerable, helpless, like the rest of the world passes you by.</p><p>鸟盒。这是一个显而易见的问题，但即使超越了表面层面的比较，我也真心觉得我现在对Bird Box有了更好的了解。一直戴着眼罩真的很让人气馁。你感到脆弱和无助，就像世界上的其他人从你身边走过一样。</p><p> Ad Astra. Specifically the montage when Brad Pitt sits in a spaceship for months all alone and slowly loses his mind. Trying to avoid spoilers here.</p><p>阿斯特拉广告公司。尤其是布拉德·皮特独自在宇宙飞船上坐了几个月，慢慢失去理智的蒙太奇镜头。在这里尽量避免剧透。</p><p> Blindness. Or rather, I’m pissed off at the entire movie for not accurately portraying all the newly blind people as incredibly lazy and sleepy all the time.</p><p>失明。或者更确切地说，我对整部电影没有准确地将所有新盲人刻画成令人难以置信的懒惰和昏昏欲睡感到恼火。</p><p> Slumdog Millionaire. Part of the reason I wanted to do this experiment was to confront a minor fear I’ve always had of going blind. The idea of permanently losing my ability to see the world is absolutely horrifying. I would probably prefer death.</p><p>贫民窟的百万富翁。我想做这个实验的部分原因是为了直面我一直以来对失明的一种小小的恐惧。永久丧失看世界的能力的想法绝对是可怕的。我可能更喜欢死。</p><p> What best exemplifies this fear to me is the scene in  Slumdog Millionaire when the guy knocks out the little beggar kid and burns his eyes with some sort of hot liquid so he will wake up blind for the rest of his life as a higher-earning beggar. I thought about that scene more than I would have liked to throughout the experiment.</p><p>对我来说，最能体现这种恐惧的是《贫民窟的百万富翁》中的一个场景：那个家伙把那个小乞丐打倒，用某种热液体灼伤了他的眼睛，这样他醒来后就会变成一个收入更高的乞丐，从此双目失明。在整个实验过程中，我对那一幕的思考比我想象的要多。</p><p>  “You think darkness is your ally… But you merely adopted the dark; I was boooooorn in it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until 2:28 PM on Thursday. By then it was nothing to me but BLINDING!”</p><p>“你认为黑暗是你的盟友…。但你只是接受了黑暗；我在黑暗中沉浸在其中，被它塑造。直到周四下午2点28分我才看到曙光。那时对我来说，这只是一件令人眼花缭乱的事情！“。</p><p>   I was blind, alone, and confused for 24 hours. Aside from the time I was asleep (which I can’t determine), I generally cycled through three phases of being.</p><p>我失明、孤独、困惑了24小时。除了我睡着的时间(我不能确定)，我一般经历了三个阶段的存在。</p><p>   The Daze Phase consisted of slowly drifting in and out of consciousness and entering a quasi-dream state.</p><p>昏迷阶段包括慢慢地进入和离开意识，并进入准梦境状态。</p><p> As mentioned, despite getting plenty of sleep and feeling fine, I became lethargic and had trouble staying awake almost immediately after putting on the blindfold. When I got too tired to do anything else, I would accept the Daze Phase by crawling into bed or leaning back in my comfy computer chair, or even putting on some light music. Then my mind would flow between topics, never really latching on to something, but never being bored either. There’s a pleasantness to the feeling… a mindless ease. It’s a good way to kill minutes or hours without noticing.</p><p>如上所述，尽管我睡得很好，感觉很好，但戴上眼罩后，我变得昏昏欲睡，几乎立刻就很难保持清醒。当我累得什么都做不了的时候，我会爬上床或者靠在我舒适的电脑椅上，甚至放一些轻音乐来接受发呆阶段。然后我的大脑就会在不同的主题之间流动，不会真正抓住某件事，但也不会感到无聊。有一种愉悦的感觉，那就是…。一种不需要动脑筋的轻松。这是在不知不觉中消磨几分钟或几个小时的好方法。</p><p> It reminded me a lot of when I was young and would lay down in the back seat during long car rides and try to sleep with my headphones on and CD playing. The movement of the vehicle and discomfort of the seat would keep me awake, but general tiredness and having nothing else to do would push me toward sleep. My mind would drift between semi-conscious thoughts and dreams, leaving me right on the edge of consciousness and sleep.</p><p>这让我想起了很多年轻的时候，在长途汽车旅行中，我会躺在后座上，试着戴着耳机，播放CD睡觉。车辆的移动和座椅的不适会让我睡不着，但普遍的疲惫和无事可做会把我推向睡眠。我的大脑会在半有意识的想法和梦境之间漂移，让我处于意识和睡眠的边缘。</p><p> The Daze Phase is an intensification of this feeling. This is a bit hard to explain, but…</p><p>迷迷期是这种感觉的一种强化。这有点难以解释，但是…</p><p> Think about waking up in the morning. You’re asleep… but not entirely. You’re dreaming, but you can feel wakefulness coming. Your uncontrolled, wandering dream thoughts and visualizations become weaker and more sporadic as you regain consciousness. Typically, opening your eyes and seeing the world, even just for a moment, is enough to finally knock you out of sleep and make you fully conscious (albeit still tired).</p><p>想想早上醒来的情景。你睡着了，…。但不是全部。你在做梦，但你能感觉到即将醒来。当你恢复意识时，你不受控制的、飘忽不定的梦境和想象会变得更弱、更零星。通常情况下，睁开眼睛看看世界，哪怕只有一小会儿，也足以让你最终睡不着觉，让你完全清醒(尽管仍然很累)。</p><p> Being blindfolded messes with that process. Because when you open your eyes, you get almost no visual input to clash against the dreamy visualizations.</p><p>被蒙住眼睛会扰乱这一过程。因为当你睁开眼睛时，你几乎没有得到任何视觉输入来与梦幻般的可视化相冲突。</p><p> As a result,  sometimes it was hard for me to tell when I was dreaming and when I was awake. In that hazy space between consciousness and sleep, I wasn’t always sure whether I had consciously produced a thought, or if my unconscious dreaming mind had visualized it for me.</p><p>结果，有时候我很难分辨什么时候在做梦，什么时候醒着。在意识和睡眠之间的朦胧空间里，我并不总是确定是我有意识地产生了一个想法，还是我潜意识的梦境为我想象了它。</p><p> A weird side effect of this process was that sometimes my mental visualization felt  brighter than my physical visual field. Again, this is very hard to explain, but… normally with the blindfold on, I would see nothing but darkness. Then I would get lost in thought and mentally visualize something, either consciously or via semi-sleep dreaming. Eventually, I would come back to full conscious thought and see my black visual field. The contrast between my mental visualization and the black visual field made the former  feel brighter than the latter, even though neither had any real brightness.</p><p>这个过程的一个奇怪的副作用是，有时我的脑海中的视觉感觉比我的物理视野更明亮。同样，这很难解释，但是…。正常情况下，戴上眼罩，我只能看到黑暗。然后，我会沉浸在思考中，在头脑中想象一些东西，无论是有意识的还是通过半睡梦的方式。最终，我会回到全意识思维状态，看到我的黑色视野。我的心理视觉和黑色视野之间的对比使前者感觉比后者更明亮，尽管两者都没有真正的亮度。</p><p> I would estimate that the Daze Phases took up about 1/3 rd of the experiment, and were actually pretty enjoyable. It’s impossible for me to adequately describe it here, but it seems to be a version of that pleasant consciousness drift you sometimes get while moving in or out of sleep which is enhanced by the suppression of visual stimuli.</p><p>我估计迷茫阶段大约占了实验的三分之一，而且实际上相当有趣。“。我不可能在这里充分描述它，但它似乎是你在进入或离开睡眠时有时会得到的愉悦意识漂移的一种版本，这种漂移会因视觉刺激的抑制而增强。</p><p>   There’s good evidence that if an individual damages or destroys one sense, other senses become stronger to compensate for it. I’m not sure if I suppressed my vision for long enough to achieve this, and I’m not sure if this is just a placebo effect, but I subjectively enjoyed listening to music while blind more than usual.</p><p>有很好的证据表明，如果一个人损坏或破坏了一种感官，其他感官就会变得更强，以弥补这一点。我不确定我的视力是否抑制了足够长的时间来达到这个效果，我也不确定这是否只是一种安慰剂效应，但我主观上比平时更喜欢在失明的情况下听音乐。</p><p> It was not only far easier for me to get into a music-listening flow state than usual, but I also got into a  deeper flow state. And it was kind of a  relaxed flow state where I didn’t care what the next song was as long as it was good. Despite having no visual input, there were hours where I was experiencing a high level of enjoyment just sitting in darkness and listening to music.</p><p>对我来说，不仅比平时更容易进入听音乐的心流状态，而且我也进入了更深层次的心流状态。这是一种轻松的流畅状态，我不在乎下一首歌是什么，只要它是好的。尽管没有视觉输入，但有几个小时，我只是坐在黑暗中听音乐，体验着高度的享受。</p><p>  For a separate experiment, I bought some nicotine lozenges. I don’t smoke and have no interest in doing so, but I’m investigating whether nicotine is an under-appreciated nootropic. For the hell of it, I popped a lozenge, put on my Spotify “best songs” playlist, and let it ride.</p><p>在另一项实验中，我买了一些尼古丁含片。我不吸烟，也没有兴趣吸烟，但我正在调查尼古丁是否是一种被低估的嗜好。该死的是，我弹出了一个糖块，放在我的Spotify“最佳歌曲”播放列表上，然后让它继续运行。</p><p> That was one of the most enjoyable 1-2 hours I’ve experienced in a long time. I was manic, I had a head rush, I was thinking intently about narratives and history and other topics I love, and the music was amplifying everything in my mind. I was sitting still in complete darkness with a blindfold on and air pods in, but my mind was going a million miles per hour. The stimulating effects of the nicotine + my favorite music + the darkness and sensory deprivation = a flow state of extreme focus and pleasure. Not that I have much experience, but it felt comparable to being on a hard stimulant.</p><p>这是我在很长一段时间里经历过的最愉快的1-2个小时之一。我很狂热，头脑发热，我在专注地思考叙事、历史和其他我喜欢的话题，音乐放大了我脑海中的一切。我静静地坐在一片漆黑中，戴着眼罩，戴着空气舱，但我的大脑却在以每小时一百万英里的速度前进。尼古丁的刺激效果+我最喜欢的音乐+黑暗和感官剥夺=一种极度专注和愉悦的流动状态。虽然我没有太多经验，但感觉就像服用了一种强效兴奋剂。</p><p> And no, it wasn’t all due to the nicotine. I had a few lozenges over the previous nights, and I found them enjoyable, but nothing close to that experience.</p><p>不，这并不全是尼古丁造成的。在前几个晚上，我吃了一些含片，我觉得它们很享受，但和那次体验相去甚远。</p><p> I don’t recommend that most people do the “blind, alone, and confused for 24 hours experiment” unless you’re super curious about physical and mental deprivation,  but I do recommend that non-smokers try the “nicotine + music in the dark” experience purely for the sake of pleasure. I think I will try it again a week from now to see if I can capture the experience without the 8ish hours of prior blindness.</p><p>我不建议大多数人做“盲目、孤独、困惑24小时的实验”，除非你对身体和精神上的剥夺非常好奇，但我建议不吸烟的人纯粹为了快乐而尝试“黑暗中的尼古丁+音乐”体验。我想从现在起一周后我会再试一次，看看我是否能捕捉到这种经历，而不是之前失明的80多个小时。</p><p>   Being blind, alone, and confused for 24 hours isn’t all dream flows and intense musical head rushes. About half the time was really, really boring.</p><p>24小时的盲目、孤独和困惑并不全是梦境的涌动和强烈的音乐狂潮。大约一半的时间是真的，真的很无聊。</p><p> Usually the Malaise Phase would come after waking up from the Daze Phase, but before my mind would settle into the Rave Phase. I’d be bored of music or of asking Siri questions. I’d be too lazy and tired to get up and get water or a diet coke. I’d wonder how much time was left in this stupid experiment, and struggle not to ask Siri. I’d sit in the dark and urge time to move faster.</p><p>通常情况下，萎靡期是在我从迷迷期醒来之后，但在我进入狂欢期之前。我会厌倦音乐或者问Siri问题。我会又懒又累，起不来喝水或喝健怡可乐。我想知道这个愚蠢的实验还剩下多少时间，我很难不去问Siri。我会坐在黑暗中，催促时间加快脚步。</p><p> This was w</p><p>这是W。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://dormin.org/2020/11/08/the-blind-alone-and-confused-for-24-hours-challenge/">https://dormin.org/2020/11/08/the-blind-alone-and-confused-for-24-hours-challenge/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/小时/">#小时</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
