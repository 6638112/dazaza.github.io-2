To be frank, I’m conflicted as to whether I’d recommend the Apple Watch to a fellow parent, as opposed to just suggesting that it’s time to get the child a phone.</p><p>结果？坦率地说，我在是否将Apple Watch推荐给同伴父母方面存在矛盾，而不是仅仅建议现在该给孩子打电话。</p><p> This has to do, in part, with the advantages offered by a dedicated family tracking solution — like Life360, for example — as well as how a child may respond to the Apple Watch itself, and the quirks of using a solution that wasn’t initially designed with the needs of family tracking in mind.</p><p> 这在一定程度上要归功于专用的家庭跟踪解决方案（例如Life360）所提供的优势，以及儿童对Apple Watch本身的反应方式，以及使用非解决方案的怪癖。最初设计时考虑了家庭追踪的需求。</p><p>  As a parent of a busy and active tween (nearly 11), I can see the initial appeal of an Apple Watch as a family tracker. It has everything you need for that purpose: GPS tracking, the ability to call and text, alerts, and access to emergency assistance. It’s easy to keep up with, theoretically, and it’s not as pricey as a new iPhone. (The new Apple Watch SE cellular models  start at $329. The feature also works on older Apple Watch Series 4 or later models with cellular. Adding on the Apple Watch to your phone plan is usually around $10 per month more.)</p><p>  作为忙碌而活跃的补间的父母（将近11岁），我可以看到Apple Watch作为家庭追踪器的最初魅力。它具有为此目的所需的一切：GPS跟踪，呼叫和发短信，警报以及获得紧急援助的功能。从理论上讲，这很容易跟上，而且不如新iPhone贵。 （新的Apple Watch SE蜂窝电话起价为329美元。该功能还适用于较旧的Apple Watch Series 4或更高版本的蜂窝电话。将Apple Watch添加到您的手机套餐中通常每月需多支付10美元。）</p><p> I think the Apple Watch as a kid tracker mainly appeals to a specific type of parent: one who’s worried about the dangers of giving a younger child a phone and thereby giving them access to the world of addictive apps and the wider internet. I understand that concern, but I personally disagree with the idea that you should wait until a child is “older,” then hand them a phone and say “ok, good luck with that!” They need a transition period and the “tween” age range is an ideal time frame to get started.</p><p> 我认为Apple Watch作为儿童追踪器，主要吸引特定类型的父母：一个担心给小孩子打电话的危险，从而使他们无法进入令人上瘾的应用程序和更广阔的互联网世界。我了解这种担心，但是我个人不同意这样的想法，即您应该等到孩子“大一些”，然后给他们打个电话，说“好吧，祝你好运！”他们需要过渡期，“过渡”年龄段是入门的理想时间范围。</p><p> The reality is that smartphones and technology are unavoidable. As a parent, I believe it’s my job to introduce these things in small measures — with parental controls and screen time limits, for example. And then I need to monitor their usage. I may make mistakes and so will my daughter, but we both need these extra years to figure out how to balance parenting and the use of digital tools. With a phone, I know I will have to have the hard conversations about the problems we run into. I understand, too, why parents want to put that off, and just buy a watch instead.</p><p> 现实是智能手机和技术是不可避免的。作为父母，我相信我的工作就是以小规模介绍这些内容，例如，通过父母控制和屏幕时间限制。然后，我需要监视它们的用法。我可能会犯错，我的女儿也可能会犯错，但是我们俩都需要这些额外的年头才能弄清楚如何在育儿和数字工具的使用之间取得平衡。有了电话，我知道我将不得不就遇到的问题进行艰苦的交谈。我也明白为什么父母要推迟这个，而只买手表。</p><p>  After my experience, I feel the only cases where I’d fully endorse the Apple Watch would be for those tech-free or tech-light families where kids will not be given phones at any point, households where kids’ phone usage is highly restricted (like those with Wi-Fi only phones), or those where kids don’t get phones until their later teenage years. I am not here to convince them of my alternative, perhaps more progressive view on when to give a kid a phone. The Apple Watch may make sense for these families and that’s their prerogative.</p><p>  根据我的经验，我觉得我唯一会完全认可Apple Watch的情况是针对那些在任何时候都不会给孩子使用电话的无技术或技术轻家庭，以及严格限制孩子使用电话的家庭（例如那些仅使用Wi-Fi的手机），或者那些孩子直到青少年时期才拿到电话的手机。我并不是要说服他们使用我的替代品，也许是关于何时给孩子打电话的更渐进的观点。 Apple Watch对这些家庭可能有意义，这就是他们的特权。</p><p> However, a number of people may be wondering if the Apple Watch can be a temporary solution for perhaps a year or two before they buy the child a smartphone. To them, I have to say this feels like  an expensive way to delay the inevitable, unavoidable task of having to parent your child through the digital age.</p><p> 但是，许多人可能想知道，在为孩子购买智能手机之前，Apple Watch是否可以作为一两年左右的临时解决方案。对他们来说，我不得不说这是一种昂贵的方法，可以推迟在数字时代为孩子做父母的不可避免，不可避免的任务。</p><p> Given my position on the matter, my one big caveat to this review is that my daughter does, in fact, have a smartphone. Also, let’s be clear: this is not meant to be a thorough review of the Apple Watch itself, or a detailed report of its various “tech specs”. It’s a subjective report as to how things went for us that, hopefully, you can learn from.</p><p>考虑到我对此事的立场，我对此评论的一个最大警告是，我的女儿确实拥有智能手机。另外，请明确一点：这并不意味着要对Apple Watch本身进行彻底的审查，也不是对其各种“技术规格”的详细报告。这是一份主观的报告，希望我们能从中学到什么。</p><p>  To begin, the process of configuring the new Apple Watch with Family Setup was easy. “Set Up for a Family Member” is one of two setup options to tap on as you get started.  Apple offers a simple user interface that walks you through pairing the Watch with your phone and all the choices that have to be made, like enabling cellular, turning on “Ask to Buy” for app purchases, enabling Schooltime and Activity features, and more.</p><p>  首先，使用“家庭设置”配置新的Apple Watch的过程非常简单。 “设置为家庭成员”是您入门时可以点击的两个设置选项之一。 Apple提供了一个简单的用户界面，可指导您将Watch与手机配对以及必须进行的所有选择，例如启用移动电话，为应用程序购买打开“问购”功能，启用上学时间和活动功能等等。</p><p> What was harder was actually using the Apple Watch as intended after it was configured. I found it far easier to launch an iPhone app (like Life360, which we use) where everything you need is in one place. That turned out not to be true for Apple Watch Family Setup system.</p><p> 实际上，更难的是实际上在配置Apple Watch后按预期使用了Apple Watch。我发现启动iPhone应用程序（例如Life360，我们使用的它）要容易得多，它将您需要的所有东西都放在一个地方。对于Apple Watch Family Setup系统，事实并非如此。</p><p> For the purpose of testing the Apple Watch with Family Setup, my daughter would leave her iPhone behind when she went out biking or when meeting up with friends for outdoor activities.</p><p> 为了测试带有家庭设置的Apple Watch，我的女儿在骑自行车或与朋友见面进行户外活动时会把iPhone留在后面。</p><p> As a child who worked her way up to an iPhone over a couple of years, I have to admit I was surprised at how irresponsible she was with the watch in the early weeks.</p><p> 作为一个在过去几年里一直使用iPhone努力工作的孩子，我不得不承认我对她在最初几周对手表的不负责任感到惊讶。</p><p> She didn’t at all respect at the multi-hundred dollar device it was, at first, but rather treated it like her junk jewelry or her wrist-worn scrunchies. The Apple Watch was tossed on a dresser, a bathroom counter, a kitchen table, on a beanbag chair, and so on.</p><p> 起初，她根本不尊重那台价值数百美元的装置，而是像对待她的垃圾珠宝或腕戴式发箍一样对待它。将Apple Watch丢在梳妆台，浴室柜台，厨房桌子，豆袋椅等上。</p><p> Thankfully, the “Find My” app  can locate the Apple Watch, if it has battery and a signal. But I’m not going to lie — there were some scary moments where a dead watch was later found on the back of a toilet (!!), on the top of the piano, and once, abandoned at a friend’s house.</p><p> 幸运的是，如果有电池和信号，“查找我”应用程序可以找到Apple Watch。但是我不会撒谎，在一些恐怖的时刻，后来在马桶后部（!!），钢琴的顶部发现了一块死表，一次丢在朋友家中。</p><p>  The problem is that her iPhone is something she learned to be responsible for after years of practice. This fooled me into thinking she actually  was  responsible for expensive devices. For two years, we painfully went through a few low-end Android phones while she got the hang of keeping up with and caring for such a device. Despite wrapping those starter phones in protective cases, we still lost one to a screen-destroying crash on a tile floor and another to being run over by a car. (How it flew out of a pocket and into the middle of the road, I’ll never understand!)</p><p>问题在于，经过多年的实践，她学会了负责iPhone。这让我以为她实际上是在为昂贵的设备负责。两年来，我们苦苦地尝试了几款低端Android手机，而她却一直坚持跟上并维护这种设备。尽管将这些入门手机包装在保护套中，但我们仍然丢失了一个，原因是它撞毁了瓷砖地板上的屏幕，而另一个则被汽车撞倒了。 （它是如何从口袋里飞出来并进入路中间的，我永远不会理解！）</p><p> But, eventually, she did earn access to a hand-me down iPhone. And after initially only being allowed to use it in the house on Wi-Fi, that phone now goes outdoors and has its own phone number. And she has been careful with it in the months since. ( Ahem,  knocks on wood.)</p><p> 但是，最终，她确实获得了使用手控式iPhone的权限。最初只允许在Wi-Fi的室内使用它之后，该电话现在可以在户外使用并拥有自己的电话号码。从那以后的几个月里，她一直很小心。 （哎呀，敲木头。）</p><p> The Apple Watch, however, held no such elevated status for her. It was not an earned privilege. It was not fun. It was not filled with favorite apps and games. It was, instead, thrust upon her.</p><p> 但是，Apple Watch对她而言却没有这样的地位。这不是获得的特权。不好玩。它没有充满喜欢的应用程序和游戏。相反，它被强加于她。</p><p> While the iPhone is used often for enjoyable and addictive activities like Roblox, TikTok, Disney+, and Netflix, the Apple Watch was boring by comparison. Sure, there are a few things you can do on the device — it has an App Store! You can make a Memoji! You can customize different watch faces! But unless this is your child’s first-ever access to technology, these features may have limited appeal.</p><p> 尽管iPhone通常用于诸如Roblox，TikTok，迪士尼+和Netflix等令人上瘾的娱乐活动，但相比之下，Apple Watch却很无聊。当然，您可以在设备上做几件事-它有一个App Store！您可以制作一个表情符号！您可以自定义不同的表盘！但是，除非这是您的孩子第一次获得技术，否则这些功能的吸引力可能有限。</p><p> “Do you want to download this game? This looks fun,” I suggested. pointing to a coloring game, as we looked at her Watch together one night.</p><p> “您要下载此游戏吗？这看起来很有趣，”我建议。指着一场着色游戏，当我们一起看她的《守夜》时。</p><p>   “I just think don’t think it would be good on the little screen.”</p><p>   “我只是认为在小屏幕上不会很好。”</p><p>   And that was that. I could not convince her to give a single Apple Watch app a try in the days that followed.</p><p>   就是这样。在接下来的日子里，我无法说服她尝试使用单个Apple Watch应用程序。</p><p> She didn’t even want to stream music on the Apple Watch — she has Alexa for that, she pointed out. She didn’t want to play a game on the watch — she has Roblox on the bigger screen of her hand-me down laptop. She also has a handheld Nintendo Switch.</p><p>她甚至不想在Apple Watch上播放音乐-她指出，她拥有Alexa。她不想在手表上玩游戏-她将Roblox放在手提电脑上，屏幕更大。她还拥有手持Nintendo Switch。</p><p>  Initially, she picked an Apple Watch face that matched her current “aesthetic” — simple and neutral — and that was the extent of her interest in personalizing the device in the first several weeks.</p><p>  最初，她选择了与她当前的“审美”相匹配的Apple Watch脸部表情（简单而中性），这就是她在最初几周内对设备进行个性化设置的兴趣程度。</p><p> Having already burned herself out on Memoji by borrowing my phone to play with the feature when it launched, there wasn’t as much interest in doing more with the customized avatar creation process, despite my suggestions to try it. (She had already made a Memoji her Profile photo for her contact card on iPhone.)</p><p> 通过借用我的手机以在其启动时使用该功能已经使自己对Memoji筋疲力尽，尽管我建议尝试使用该功能，但对自定义头像创建过程做更多的工作并没有太大的兴趣。 （她已经在iPhone上使用她的名片制作了一张Memoji个人资料照片。）</p><p> However, I later showed her the Memoji Watch Face option after I set it up, and asked her if she liked it. She responded “YESSSS. I love it,” and snatched the watch from my hand to play some more.</p><p> 但是，设置好之后，我后来向她展示了Memoji表盘选项，并询问她是否喜欢它。她回答“ YESSSS。 “我喜欢它。”然后从我的手中抢走了手表，以进行更多演奏。</p><p>  But largely, the Apple Watch was only strapped on only at my request as she walked out the door.</p><p>  但是在很大程度上，Apple Watch只是在我走出门时才应我的要求系上。</p><p>     It took over a month to get to the point that she would remember the watch on her own.</p><p>     花了一个多月的时间，她才意识到自己会记得那只手表。</p><p> I have to admit that I didn’t fully demo the Apple Watch to her or explain how to use it in detail, beyond a few basics in those beginning weeks. While I could have made her an expert, I suppose, I think it’s important to realize that many parents are less tech-savvy than their kids. The children are often left to fend for themselves when it comes to devices, and this particular kid has had several devices. For that reason, I was curious how a fairly tech literate child who has moved from iPad to Android to now iPhone, and who hops from Windows to Mac to Chromebook, would now adapt to an Apple Watch.</p><p> 我不得不承认，除了开始的几周的一些基本知识之外，我还没有向她完全演示Apple Watch或向其解释如何详细使用它。我想，虽然我本可以让她成为专家，但我认为重要的是要认识到，许多父母比他们的孩子对技术的了解要少。当涉及到设备时，孩子们通常不得不自己照顾自己，这个孩子有几种设备。出于这个原因，我很好奇一个已经从iPad迁移到Android到现在的iPhone，并且从Windows迁移到Mac到Chromebook的具有相当技术素养的孩子现在如何适应Apple Watch。</p><p>  “What do you think about the Watch?” I asked one evening, feeling her out for an opinion.</p><p>“您如何看待手表？”我问了一个晚上，感到她在征求意见。</p><p> “It’s fun…but sometimes I don’t really understand it,” she replied.</p><p> 她回答说：“这很有趣，但是有时候我不太了解。”</p><p>  “I don’t know. Just… almost everything,” she said, dramatically, as tweens tend to do. “Like, sometimes  I don’t know how to turn up and down the volume.”</p><p>  “我不知道。只是……几乎所有东西，”她随着补间趋向于戏剧化地说道。 “就像有时候，我不知道如何调高音量。”</p><p> Upon prodding, I realize she meant this: she was confused about how to  adjust the alert volume for messages and notifications, as well as how to change the Watch from phone calls to a vibration or to  silence calls altogether with Do Not Disturb. (It was her only real complaint, but annoying enough to be “almost everything,” I guess!)</p><p> 受到刺激后，我意识到她的意思是：她对如何调整消息和通知的警报音量以及如何将“手表”从电话更改为振动或完全静音与“请勿打扰”感到困惑。 （这是她唯一真正的抱怨，但足以使她成为“几乎所有事情”，这很烦人！）</p><p>  First, given that the “Do Not Disturb” option is  accessible from a swipe gesture, it’s clear my daughter hadn’t fully explored the watch’s user interface. It didn’t occur to her that the swipe gestures of the iPhone would have their own Apple Watch counterparts. (And also,  why would you swipe up from the  bottom of the screen for the Control Center when  that doesn’t work on the iPhone anymore? On iPhone, you now  swipe down from the top-right to get to Control Center functions.)</p><p>  首先，鉴于可以通过滑动手势访问“请勿打扰”选项，所以很明显，我的女儿还没有完全浏览手表的用户界面。她并没有想到iPhone的滑动手势会拥有自己的Apple Watch。 （而且，为什么在iPhone上不再可用时，为什么要从控制中心的屏幕底部向上滑动呢？在iPhone上，您现在从右上角向下滑动以进入控制中心功能。）</p><p> And she definitely hadn’t discovered the tiny “Settings” app (the gear icon) on the Apple Watch’s Home Screen to make further changes.</p><p> 而且，她肯定还没有在Apple Watch主屏幕上发现微小的“设置”应用（齿轮图标）来进行进一步的更改。</p><p> Instead, her expectation was that you should be able to use either a button on the side for managing volume — you know, like on a phone — or maybe the digital crown, since that’s available here. But these physical features of the device — confusingly — took her to that “unimportant stuff” like the Home Screen and an app switcher, when in actuality, it was calls, notifications, and alerts that were the app’s main function, in her opinion.</p><p> 相反，她的期望是您应该可以使用侧面的按钮来管理音量（如在电话上一样），也可以使用数字表冠，因为这里可用。但是，设备的这些物理功能（令人困惑的是）将她带到了“无关紧要的东西”，例如主屏幕和应用程序切换器，实际上，呼叫，通知和警报是应用程序的主要功能，她认为。</p><p> And why do you need to zoom into the Home Screen with a turn of the digital crown? She wasn’t even using the apps at this point. There weren’t that many on the screen.</p><p>又为什么需要旋转数字表冠来放大主屏幕？她现在甚至都没有使用这些应用程序。屏幕上没有那么多。</p><p> Curious, since she didn’t care for the current lineup of apps, I asked for feedback.</p><p> 很好奇，由于她不关心当前的应用程序系列，因此我要求提供反馈。</p><p>    As it turned out, she didn’t want to  play Roblox on her watch. She wanted to respond to her incoming messages and participate in her group chats from her watch.</p><p>    事实证明，她不想在手表上玩Roblox。她想回复收到的消息，并参加手表的小组聊天。</p><p> Oh. That’s actually a reasonable idea. The Apple Watch is, after all, a messaging device.</p><p> 哦。这实际上是一个合理的想法。毕竟，Apple Watch是一种消息传递设备。</p><p> And since many kids her age don’t have a phone or the ability to use a messaging app like Snapchat or Instagram, they trade Roblox usernames and friend each other in the game as way to work around this restriction. They then message each other to arrange virtual playdates or even real-life ones if they live nearby.</p><p> 而且由于年龄在同一个年龄段的许多孩子都没有电话或无法使用Snapchat或Instagram等消息传递应用程序，因此他们在游戏中交易Roblox用户名并彼此成为朋友，以此来解决这一限制。然后，他们彼此发送消息以安排虚拟的播放日期，如果他们住在附近，甚至安排现实生活的日期。</p><p> But the iOS version of the Roblox mobile app doesn’t have an Apple Watch counterpart.</p><p> 但是，Roblox移动应用程序的iOS版本没有Apple Watch。</p><p>  But the fact that Apple Watch is not exactly an ideal video player is lost on her. It’s a device with a screen, connected to the internet. So why isn’t that enough, she wondered?</p><p>  但是，Apple Watch并非完全是理想的视频播放器这一事实使她不知所措。这是一个带有屏幕的设备，已连接到互联网。她想知道为什么还不够呢？</p><p> “You could look through popular TikToks,” she suggested. “You wouldn’t need to make an account or anything,” she clarified, as these details were would fix the only problems she saw with her suggestion.</p><p>她建议：“您可以浏览流行的TikToks。”她澄清说：“您无需注册帐户或其他任何内容，因为这些详细信息将解决她在建议中看到的唯一问题。</p><p> Even if the technology was there, a TikTok experience on the small screen would never be a great one. But this goes to show how much interest in technology is directly tied to what apps and games are available, compared with the technology platform itself.</p><p> 即使有了这项技术，在小屏幕上进行TikTok体验也绝不会是一件好事。但是，这表明与技术平台本身相比，对技术的兴趣与可使用的应用程序和游戏直接相关。</p><p>   Though I had set up some basic Activity features during the setup process,  like a “Move Goal,” she had no idea what any of that was. So I showed her the “ rings” and how they worked, and she thought it was kind of neat that the Apple Watch could track her standing. However, there was no genuine interest or excitement in being able quantify her daily movement — at least, not until one day many weeks later when were hiking and she heard my watch ding as my rings closed and wanted to do the same on hers. She became interested in recording her steps for that hike, but the interest wasn’t sustained afterwards.</p><p>   尽管我在设置过程中设置了一些基本的“活动”功能，例如“移动目标”，但她不知道这是什么。因此，我向她展示了“戒指”及其运作方式，她认为Apple Watch可以追踪她的站立状况真是太好了。但是，能够量化她的日常活动并没有真正的兴趣或兴奋-至少直到几周后的一天徒步旅行时，她才听到我的手表在叮当响，因为我的戒指闭合了，想对她做同样的事情。她开始有兴趣记录自己远足的脚步，但此后这种兴趣并没有持续。</p><p> Apple said it built in the Activity features so kids could track their move goal and exercise progress. But I would guess many kids won’t care about this, even if they’re active. After all, kids play — they don’t think “how much did I play?” Did I move enough today? And nor should they, really.</p><p> 苹果表示，它内置了“活动”功能，因此孩子们可以追踪自己的运动目标和锻炼进度。但是我想，即使他们很活跃，许多孩子也不会在意这一点。毕竟，孩子们玩耍-他们不认为“我玩了多少？”我今天动得够吗？他们也不应该，真的。</p><p> As a parent, I can see her data in the Health app on my iPhone, which is the device I use to manage her Apple Watch. It’s interesting, perhaps, to see things like her steps walked or flights climbed. But it’s not entirely useful, as her Apple Watch is not continually worn throughout the day. (She finds the bands uncomfortable — we tried Sport Band and Sport Loop and she still fiddles with them constantly, trying to readjust them for comfort.)</p><p> 作为父母，我可以在iPhone上的“健康”应用程序中查看她的数据，这是我用来管理Apple Watch的设备。也许有趣的是，看到诸如她的脚步走路或飞机爬升之类的事情。但这并不完全有用，因为她的Apple Watch并非一整天都在持续佩戴。 （她发现乐队不舒服-我们尝试了Sport Band和Sport Loop，但她仍然不断地摆弄它们，试图重新调整它们的舒适度。）</p><p> In addition, if I did want to change her Activity goals later on for some reason, I’d have to do from her Watch directly.</p><p> 此外，如果以后由于某些原因我确实想更改她的“活动”目标，则必须直接从她的“手表”中进行操作。</p><p> Of course, a parent doesn’t buy a child an Apple Watch to track their exercise. It’s for the location tracking features. That is the only real reason a parent would consider this device for a younger child.</p><p> 当然，父母不会给孩子买Apple Watch来跟踪他们的运动。用于位置跟踪功能。这是父母为年幼的孩子考虑使用该设备的唯一真实原因。</p><p> On that front, I did like that the watch was a GPS tracker that was looped into our household Apple ecosystem as its own device with its own phone number. I liked that I could ping the Watch with “Find My” when it’s lost — and it was lost a lot, as I noted. I liked that I could manage the Watch from my iPhone, since it’s very difficult to reacquire a device to make changes, once it’s handed over to someone else.</p><p>在那方面，我确实喜欢这只手表是GPS追踪器，该追踪器作为具有自己电话号码的自带设备循环进入我们的家用Apple生态系统。我喜欢我可以在手表丢失时使用“查找我的手表”对手表进行ping操作-正如我指出的那样，它丢失了很多。我喜欢我可以从iPhone上管理手表，因为一旦将设备移交给他人，很难重新获得进行更改的设备。</p><p> I also liked the Apple Watch was always available for use. This may have been one of its biggest perks, in fact. Unlike my daughter’s iPhone, which is almost constantly at 10-20% battery (or much less), the watch was consistently charged and ready when it was time for outdoor play.</p><p> 我还喜欢Apple Watch始终可以使用。实际上，这可能是其最大的特权之一。与我女儿的iPhone电池电量几乎恒定为10-20％（或更少）不同，手表可以持续充电并在户外活动时准备就绪。</p><p> I liked that it was easier for her to answer a call on the Apple Watch compared with digging her phone out of her bike basket or bag. I liked that she didn’t have to worry about constantly holding onto her phone while out and about.</p><p> 我喜欢她比从自行车篮或书包中掏出手机要容易地在Apple Watch上接听电话。我喜欢她不必担心出门在外时不断按住手机。</p><p> I also appreciated that I could create geofenced alerts — like when she reached the park or a friend’s house, for example, or when she left. But I didn’t like that the ability to do so is buried in the “Find My” app. (You tap on the child’s name in the “People” tab. Tap “Add” under “Notifications.” Tap “Notify Me.” Tap “New Location.” Do a search for an address or venue. Tap “Done.”)</p><p> 我也很欣赏我可以创建地理防御警报，例如当她到达公园或朋友的房子时，或者当她离开时。但是我不喜欢这种功能被埋在“查找我的”应用程序中。 （您在“人”选项卡中点击孩子的名字。点击“通知”下的“添加”。点击“通知我”。点击“新位置”。搜索地址或地点。点击“完成”。）</p><p>  I also didn’t like that when I created a recurring geofence, my daughter would be notified. Yes,  privacy. I know! But who’s in charge here? My daughter is a child, not a teen. She knows the Apple Watch is a GPS tracker — we had that conversation. She knows it allows me to see where she is. She’s young and for now, she doesn’t feel like this a privacy violation. We’ll have that discussion later, I’m sure. But at the present, she likes the feel of this electronic tether to home as she experiments with expanding the boundaries of her world.</p><p>  我也不喜欢这样，当我创建循环地理围栏时，会通知我的女儿。是的，隐私。我知道！但是谁来负责？我的女儿是孩子，而不是青少年。她知道Apple Watch是GPS追踪器-我们进行了交谈。她知道这可以让我看到她在哪里。她还很年轻，现在还没有那种侵犯隐私的感觉。我确定，我们稍后再进行讨论。但是目前，她在尝试扩展自己的世界边界时喜欢这种电子束带的感觉。</p><p> When I tweak and update recurring alerts for geofenced locations, such alerts can be confusing or even concerning. I appreciate that Apple is being transparent and trying to give kids the ability to understand they’re being tracked — but I’d also argue that most parents who suddenly gift an expensive watch to their child will explain why they’re doing so. This is a tool, not a toy.</p><p> 当我调整和更新针对地理位置的定期提醒时，此类提醒可能会造成混乱甚至令人担忧。我感谢Apple透明并努力让孩子们了解被追踪的能力-但我也认为，大多数突然向孩子赠送昂贵手表的父母会解释为什么这样做。这是工具，而不是玩具。</p><p> Also, the interface for configuring geofences is cumbersome. By comparison, the family tracking app Life360 which we normally use has a screen where you simply tap add, search to find the location, and then you’re done. One tap on a bell icon next to the location turns on or off its alerts. (You can get all granular about it: recurring, one time, arrives, leaves, etc. — but you don’t have to. Just tap and be alerted. It’s more straightforward.)</p><p> 而且，用于配置地理围栏的界面很麻烦。相比之下，我们通常使用的家庭跟踪应用程序Life360的屏幕上，您只需点击添加，搜索以找到位置，然后就可以完成。只需轻按一下该位置旁边的响铃图标，即可打开或关闭其警报。 （您可以得到所有相关的详细信息：重复，一次，到达，离开等，但您不必这样做。只需轻按一下并发出警报即可。这更加简单。）</p><p>  One feature I did like on the Apple Watch, but sadly couldn’t really use, was  its Schooltime mode — a sort of remotely-enabled, scheduled version of Do Not Disturb. This feature blocks apps and complications and turns on the Do Not Disturb setting for the kids, while letting  emergency calls and notifications break through. (Make sure to set up  Shared Contacts, so you can manage that aspect.)</p><p>我喜欢在Apple Watch上使用的一项功能，但遗憾的是无法真正使用，它的Schooltime模式是一种远程启用的预定版本的“请勿打扰”功能。此功能可阻止应用程序和并发症，并为孩子打开“请勿打扰”设置，同时让紧急呼叫和通知中断。 （请确保设置共享联系人，以便您可以管理该方面。）</p><p> Currently, we have no use for Schooltime, thanks to this pandemic. My daughter is attending school remotely this year. I could imagine how this may be helpful one day when she returns to class.</p><p> 由于这种大流行，目前我们无法用于Schooltime。我女儿今年远程上学。我可以想像，有一天她重返课堂可能会有所帮助。</p><p> But I also worry that if I sent her to class with the Apple Watch, other kids will judge her for her expensive device. I worry that teachers (who don’t know about Schooltime), will judge me for having her wear it. I worry kids will covet it and ask to try it on. I worry a kid running off with it, causing additional disciplinary headaches for teachers. I worry it will get smashed on the playground or during PE, or somehow fall off because she meddled with the band for the umpteenth time. I worry she’ll take it off because “the strap is so annoying” (as I was told), then leave it in her desk.</p><p> 但是我也担心如果我把她送去Apple Watch上课，其他孩子会因为她昂贵的设备而对她做出判断。我担心老师（不知道上学时间）会判断我是否穿了它。我担心孩子们会垂涎并要求试穿。我担心一个孩子会因此而逃跑，这会给老师带来更多的纪律性头痛。我担心它会在操场上或在体育比赛中被砸碎，或者因为她不时与乐队混在一起而以某种方式脱落。我担心她会把它脱下来，因为“皮带太烦人了”（据我所知），然后将其留在她的桌子上。</p><p> I don’t worry as much about the iPhone at school, because it stays in her backpack the whole time due to school policy. It doesn’t sit on her arm as a constant temptation, “Schooltime” mode or otherwise.</p><p> 我不必担心学校的iPhone，因为出于学校政策的考虑，iPhone一直都放在她的背包里。它不会以不断的诱惑，“学时”模式或其他方式坐在她的手臂上。</p><p> The Apple Watch Family Setup is also not a solution that adapts as the child ages to the expanding needs of teen monitoring, compared with other family tracking solutions.</p><p> 与其他家庭跟踪解决方案相比，Apple Watch Family Setup也不适合随年龄增长的儿童适应青少年监控的不断增长的需求。</p><p> To continue the Life360 comparison, the app today offers features for teen drivers and its new  privacy-sensitive location “bubbles” for teens now give them more autonomy. Apple’s family tracking solution, meanwhile, becomes more limited as the child ages up.</p><p> 为了继续进行Life360比较，今天的应用程序为青少年驾驶员提供了功能，其针对青少年的新的隐私敏感位置“气泡”现在为他们提供了更多的自治权。同时，随着孩子的年龄增长，Apple的家庭追踪解决方案变得越来越有限。</p><p> For instance, Schooltime doesn’t work on an iPhone. Once the child upgrades to an iPhone, you are meant to use parental controls and Screen Time features to manage what apps are allowed and when she can use her device. It seems a good transitional step to the phone would be a way to maintain Schooltime mode on the child’s next device, too.</p><p> 例如，Schooltime在iPhone上不起作用。孩子升级到iPhone后，您将可以使用家长控制和屏幕时间功能来管理允许使用哪些应用程序以及何时可以使用其设备。看来，向手机过渡是一个很好的步骤，这也是一种在孩子的下一台设备上维持“学时”模式的方法。</p><p> Instead, by buying into Apple Watch for its Family Setup features, what you’ll soon end up with is a child who now owns both an Apple Watch and a smartphone. (Sure, you could regift it or take it back, I suppose…I certainly do wish you luck if you try that!)</p><p>相反，通过购买Apple Watch的家庭设置功能，您很快就会得到一个孩子，他现在同时拥有Apple Watch和智能手机。 （当然，我想您可以把它收起来或拿回来，如果您尝试的话，我当然希望您好运！）</p><p> Beyond the overboard embrace of consumerism that is buying an Apple Watch for a child, the biggest complaint I had was that there were three different apps for me to use to manage and view data associated with my daughter’s Apple Watch. I could view her tracked activity was tracked in my Health app. Location-tracking and geofence configuration was in the Find My app. And remotely configuring the Apple Watch itself, including Schooltime, was found in my Watch mobile app.</p><p> 除了为孩子购买Apple Watch的过度消费主义外，我最大的抱怨是我可以使用三种不同的应用程序来管理和查看与女儿的Apple Watch相关的数据。我可以查看她在“健康”应用程序中跟踪到的活动。位置跟踪和地理围栏配置位于“查找我”应用程序中。在我的Watch移动应用程序中可以远程配置Apple Watch本身，包括Schooltime。</p><p> I understand that Apple built the Watch to be a personal device designed for use with one person and it had to stretch to turn it into a family tracking system. But what Apple is doing here is really just pairing the child’s watch with the parent’s iPhone and then tacking on extra features, like Schooltime. It hasn’t approached this as a whole new system designed from the ground-up for families or for their expanding needs as the child grows.</p><p> 据我了解，Apple将Watch打造为专为一个人使用而设计的个人设备，因此不得不将其转变为家庭追踪系统。但是Apple在这里所做的实际上只是将孩子的手表与父母的iPhone配对，然后使用诸如Schooltime之类的附加功能。它并没有从整体上解决这个问题，它是专为家庭或随着孩子的成长而不断扩展的需求而设计的。</p><p> As a result, the whole system feels underdeveloped compared with existing family tracking solutions. And given the numerous features to configure, adjust, and monitor, Family Setup deserves its own app or at the very least, its own tab in a parent’s Watch app to simplify its use.</p><p> 结果，与现有的家庭跟踪解决方案相比，整个系统感觉欠发达。鉴于配置，调整和监视的众多功能，“家庭设置”应该拥有自己的应用，或者至少应拥有父级“ Watch”应用中的其自定义标签，以简化其使用。</p><p> At the end of the day, if you are letting your child out in the world — beyond school and supervised playdates — the Apple Watch is a solution, but it may not be the best solution for your needs. If you have sp</p><p> 归根结底，如果您要让孩子放学到世界各地（包括学校和受监管的玩耍日），Apple Watch是一种解决方案，但它可能并不是满足您需求的最佳解决方案。如果您有sp</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/动画/">#动画</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/孩子/">#孩子</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
