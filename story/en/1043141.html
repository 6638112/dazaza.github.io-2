To those who knew Bob, it will provoke warm memories to say that he was not a language guy; he understood image, and story, and the delicate way in which those elements should meet.</p><p>这个故事始于一个名叫鲍勃·科尔斯伯里（Bob Colesberry）的家伙，他在我有幸与他合作的三，四年中尽可能多地教会我电影制作方面的知识。对于那些认识鲍勃的人，这会激起人们的美好回忆，说他不是一个语言人物。他了解图像，故事以及这些元素相遇的精致方式。</p><p> Bob spent a too-short lifetime on film sets, working beside real filmmakers – Scorsese, Bertolucci, Pakula, Levinson, Ang Lee – helping to shepherd the ideas of many great directors and eschewing the limelight altogether for the chance. But, hey, if you don’t believe me about how substantial his resume was, go to  imdb right now and trace the arc of his career. That he ended up tethered to some ex-police reporter in Baltimore was pure forbearance on his part; for my part, I can just say I got very lucky.</p><p> 鲍勃在电影摄影机上花了很短的时间，与真正的电影制作人（Scorsese，Bertolucci，Pakula，Levinson和Ang Lee）一起工作-有助于传播许多伟大导演的想法并完全避开风头。但是，嘿，如果您不相信我关于他的履历的实质，请立即去imdb并追寻他的职业生涯。他最终与巴尔的摩的一名前警察记者联系在一起，这完全是他的宽容。就我而言，我只能说我很幸运。</p><p> It is no exaggeration that Bob had to explain “crossing the line” to me a dozen times, often twice in the same day, before my brain could grasp a concept that first-year film students everywhere take for granted. If you go to the fourth episode of the first season of  The Wire, and watch the camerawork on that long scene with Freamon and McNulty in the bar, you’ll be a bystander to the moment when the linear word-brain that I drag to set every day was finally allowed a few rays of cinematic light, courtesy of a patient mentor.</p><p> 毫不夸张的是，鲍勃必须向我解释十二次“越界”，通常是同一天两次，这在我的大脑可以理解到各地一年级电影生都认为理所当然的概念之前。如果您进入《 The Wire》第一季的第四集，并在酒吧中与Freamon和McNulty一起观看那片长片上的摄影作品，那么您将成为我拖曳到线性单词大脑的那一刻的旁观者终于在每天的场景中允许了几道电影的光芒，这是由一位患者导师提供的。</p><p> “See what happens when we cross over and everything flips?” he explained for the thirteenth time. “If you see the move happen, you aren’t disoriented, but if we were to cut that moment and then suddenly be on the other side…”</p><p> “看看我们越过一切都会发生什么？”他第十三次解释。 “如果您看到这一举动发生了，您并不会迷失方向，但是如果我们削减那一刻，然后突然站在另一侧……”</p><p>  “So…the dialogue that they’re saying when we cross the line and reverse on them – those words –we can’t cut those. You good with that?”</p><p>  “所以……当我们越过终点线并在他们身上倒转时，他们所说的对话-这些话-我们无法削减。你这样好吗？”</p><p>   Huh. The next day, I sauntered up to Bob at the video monitors and, in my best deadpan, asked him yet again to explain crossing the line. He looked on me sadly as a terminal case, until I started laughing. No, I had finally learned something about the camera and the credit was his. I just couldn’t resist pulling the man’s coat one more time.</p><p>   嗯第二天，我在视频监视器上向鲍勃走来走去，在我最好的呆滞时间内，再次请他解释越界问题。在我开始大笑之前，他伤心地看着我作为一个终端盒。不，我终于对相机有了一些了解，值得称赞的是他。我忍不住又拉了一次男人的外套。</p><p> In telling that story on myself, I’m trying to make clear that while I might have learned to put film in the can in a basic way before the marriage to Mr. Colesberry, I had no claim to anything remotely resembling a film auteur. It was Bob who created the visual template for  The Corner and  The Wire both, and having died suddenly after the latter drama’s second season, it is Bob who is remembered wistfully every time we begin to construct the visuals for some fresh narrative world. He would have reveled in  Generation Kill, and knowing what I do about the visual palate that New Orleans offers the world, I am unsure that Bob Colesberry could have ever been pried from that city had he gone down there for  Treme.</p><p> 在向我讲述这个故事时，我想说明的是，虽然我可能已经学会了在嫁给Colesberry先生之前以一种基本的方式将胶卷装进罐子里，但我并没有声称有什么像胶卷导演那样的东西。鲍勃为《角落》和《铁丝网》都创建了视觉模板，并且在第二部戏剧第二季后突然去世，每当我们开始为一些崭新的叙事世界构建视觉效果时，鲍勃都会被人们铭记。他本来会陶醉在Generation Kill中，并且知道我对新奥尔良为世界提供的视觉上的看法，但我不确定Bob Colesberry如果去了Treme，可能会从那个城市被撬出来。 </p><p> As devoted as he was to imagery and story, language was always a lesser currency in Bob’s life; he often made his arguments elliptically, curling in sentence-fragment circles until he got to where he needed to go. You had to lean in and listen a little harder, but it was always worthwhile and he was usually correct when he got to his point. Once, at a TCA panel on  The Wire, Bob answered a reporter’s question in vague terms and at length. To lighten the moment, I tossed off a joke: “Now you can see why Bob’s in command of the visuals.” It was teasing and steeped in affection, but I regretted the remark as soon as I uttered it. Bob’s contributions to the storytelling were profound, and though he laughed it off, I had been heedless. His claim on  The Wire and what it was trying to do was genuine and elemental; for years, before and after his death, I wanted that moment back to exalt my friend and colleague.</p><p>正如他致力于图像和故事一样，语言在鲍勃一生中一直是次要的货币。他经常使自己的论点变得椭圆形，,缩在句子片段中，直到他到达需要去的地方。您必须倾身并用力听些，但是这总是值得的，当他说清楚时，他通常是正确的。一次，鲍勃（Bob）在《 The Wire》的TCA小组中，用模糊的措词并详尽地回答了记者的问题。为了减轻压力，我开了个玩笑：“现在您可以看到鲍勃为什么要掌控视觉效果。”这很戏弄，而且深情，但是我一说完，我就后悔了。鲍勃对讲故事的贡献是深远的，尽管他笑了起来，但我还是一头雾水。他对《 The Wire》的主张及其试图做的是真实的，基本的；多年来，在他去世之前和之后，我都希望这一刻回过头来颂扬我的朋友和同事。</p><p> So when HBO sent out some promo ads about a conversion of  The Wire to HD and a 16:9 ratio a few months ago, I reacted not merely as David Simon, showrunner and ink-stained scribbler, but as David Simon, the medium for Robert Colesberry, professional filmmaker. WWBD. What would Bob do?</p><p> 因此，当HBO几个月前发出一些有关将The Wire转换为HD和16：9比率的促销广告时，我不仅做出了回应，不仅是表演秀主持人和沾有墨水的涂鸦者David Simon，还作为媒体的David Simon Robert Colesberry，专业电影制片人。 WWBD。鲍勃会做什么？</p><p>   Nina Noble and I were told a year ago that HBO wanted to experiment with taking  The Wire, filmed in standard definition and a 4:3 ratio, to the new industry standards. We endorsed the effort, but after we last spoke to folks on the production side, we had expected to be shown some work recast in high definition and wider screen and to begin discussions at that point. Instead, we heard nothing until on-air promos for  The Wire in HD began to be broadcast and packaging material for a fresh release of the drama was forwarded to us in Yonkers, where we are shooting our current HBO project.</p><p>   Nina Noble和我一年前被告知，HBO希望尝试将以标清和4：3比例拍摄的The Wire引入新的行业标准。我们认可了这项工作，但是在我们最后一次与生产方面的人们交谈之后，我们期望可以在高清和更宽的屏幕上显示一些重新制作的作品，并在那时开始讨论。相反，我们什么也没听到，直到开始播出高清电影《 The Wire》的直播促销节目，并将电视剧的新发行包装材料转发给我们在Yonkers拍摄的HBO项目。</p><p> No offense was taken, particularly when the production people explained that the transfer to HD had been laborious and ornate, and it was simply assumed that we were too busy with current production to dive into the process in detail. And, too, there was a further assumption at HBO that as a transfer to HD could provide a fresh audience for the drama, there was no real disincentive to an HD transfer of  The Wire on any terms; if it could be done, they reasoned, it should be done.</p><p> 没有采取任何冒犯，特别是当制作人员解释说向HD的转移非常繁琐和华丽时，仅假设我们太忙于当前的制作而无法详细介绍该过程。而且，HBO还存在一个进一步的假设，即向高清转播可以为电视剧提供新的观众，因此丝毫不妨碍高清转播《电线》。他们认为，如果可以做到，那就应该做到。</p><p> And yet, I still had Bob Colesberry in my ear. Moreover, Bob’s history with HD and a 16:9 ratio in regard to  The Wire was a tortured one. His intentions, the limitations imposed on our production, and his resulting template for the drama were known to me, if not to the folks presently struggling with a retroactive transfer to HD and widescreen.</p><p> 但是，我的耳朵里仍然有鲍勃·科尔斯伯里（Bob Colesberry）。此外，鲍勃（Bob）的高清历史与《电汇》（The Wire）的比例为16：9令人折磨。他的意图，对我们制作的限制以及他制作的戏剧模板对我来说是众所周知的，即使不是现在正在努力向高清和宽屏过渡的人们也知道。</p><p> In fact, Bob had asked before filming  The Wire pilot in late 2001 for a widescreen aspect ratio. He correctly saw television screens growing wider and 16:9 ratio becoming industry standard, and coming from the feature world, it was his inclination to be as filmic as possible. But, to be honest,  The Wire was at its inception a bit of shoestring affair and expectations for the drama at HBO were certainly modest. Filming in letter-box was more expensive at the time, and we were told, despite Bob’s earnest appeals, that we should shoot the pilot and the ensuing season in 4:3.</p><p> 实际上，鲍勃在2001年底拍摄《连线》飞行员之前就曾要求过宽屏纵横比。他正确地看到电视屏幕越来越宽，并且16：9的比例已成为行业标准，并且来自功能世界，他倾向于尽可能地拍摄电影。但是，老实说，《电汇》刚成立之初就有些小事，对HBO的电视剧的期望肯定不高。当时用信箱拍摄更昂贵，而且尽管鲍勃恳切呼吁我们被告知，我们应该在4：3拍摄飞行员和随后的季节。</p><p> At which point, Bob set about to work with 4:3 as the given. And while we were filming in 35mm and could have ostensibly “protected” ourselves by adopting wider shot composition in the event of some future change of heart by HBO, the problem with doing so is obvious: If you compose a shot for a wider 16:9 screen, then you are, by definition, failing to optimize the composition of the 4:3 image. Choose to serve one construct and at times you must impair the other.</p><p> 此时，Bob开始使用给定的4：3。当我们在35mm胶片上拍摄时，表面上可以通过在HBO将来改变心脏而采用更宽的镜头组成来“保护”自己，而这样做的问题很明显：如果您为更宽的16幅镜头拍摄， 9屏幕，那么，按照定义，您就无法优化4：3图像的构图。选择服务于一种结构，有时您必须损害另一种。 </p><p> Because we knew the show would be broadcast in 4:3, Bob chose to maximize the storytelling within that construct. As full wide shots in 4:3 rendered protagonists smaller, they couldn’t be sustained for quite as long as in a feature film, but neither did we go running too quickly to close-ups as a consequence. Instead, mid-shots became an essential weapon for Bob, and on those rare occasions when he was obliged to leave the set, he would remind me to ensure that the director covered scenes with mid-sized shots that allowed us to effectively keep the story in the wider world, and to resist playing too much of the story in close shots.</p><p>因为我们知道该节目将在4：3播出，所以鲍勃选择在该结构中最大限度地讲故事。由于4：3的全幅镜头会使主角变小，因此它们无法像故事片中那样持续很长时间，但是结果我们也没有很快拍摄特写镜头。取而代之的是，中景镜头成为Bob必不可少的武器，在极少数情况下，他不得不离开场景时，他会提醒我确保导演用中景镜头遮盖场景，从而使我们能够有效地保留故事在更广阔的世界中，并避免近距离播放过多的故事。</p><p> Similarly, Bob further embraced the 4:3 limitation by favoring gentle camera movements and a combination of track shots and hand-held work, implying a documentarian construct. If we weren’t going to be panoramic and omniscient in 4:3, then we were going to approach scenes with a camera that was intelligent and observant, but intimate. Crane shots didn’t often help, and anticipating a movement or a line of dialogue often revealed the filmmaking artifice. Better to have the camera react and acquire, coming late on a line now and then. Better to have the camera in the flow of a housing-project courtyard or squad room, calling less attention to itself as it nonetheless acquired the tale.</p><p> 同样，鲍勃通过偏爱柔和的相机移动以及轨迹拍摄和手持工作的结合，进一步拥抱了4：3的局限性，暗示了纪录片的构造。如果我们不想在4：3中变得全景无所不知，那么我们将使用智能，细心但亲密的相机接近场景。起重机拍摄并不常有帮助，而预料到一场运动或一场对话通常会揭示电影制作的技巧。最好让相机做出反应和获取，时不时地排成一行。最好将摄像机放在房屋计划的院子或小队房间的流动中，但尽管如此，还是要让摄像机吸引人的注意。</p><p> In the beginning, we tried to protect for letterbox, but by the end of the second season, our eyes were focused on the story that could be told using 4:3, and we composed our shots to maximize a film style that suggested not the vistas of feature cinematography, but the capture and delicacy of documentarian camerawork. We got fancy at points, and whatever rules we had, we broke them now and again; sometimes the results were a delight, sometimes less so. But by and large, Bob had shaped a template that worked for the dystopian universe of  The Wire, a world in which the environment was formidable and constricting, and the field of vision for so many of our characters was limited and even contradictory.</p><p> 一开始，我们尝试保护信箱，但是到第二季结束时，我们的目光集中在可以使用4：3讲述的故事上，我们构图以最大程度地展现电影风格，而这并没有暗示功能摄影的远景，但纪录片摄影作品的捕捉和精致。我们在某些方面很看中，无论我们有什么规则，我们都一遍又一遍地打破它们。有时结果令人高兴，有时则不那么高兴。但是总的来说，鲍勃塑造了一个模板，该模板适用于《电汇》的反乌托邦宇宙，在这个世界中，环境令人生畏且狭窄，我们很多角色的视野有限，甚至相互矛盾。</p><p> Bob Colesberry died during surgery while we were prepping season three of the drama. A short time later, HBO came to us with news that the world was going to HD and 16:9, as Bob had anticipated. We could, if we wanted, film the remaining seasons of   The Wire in HD and widescreen. But at that point a collective decision then was made to complete the project using the template that we had honed, the construct that we felt we had used to good effect to make the story feel more stolen than shaped, and to imply a more journalistic rendering of Baltimore than a filmic one.</p><p> 鲍勃·科尔斯伯里（Bob Colesberry）在手术中去世，而当时我们正在准备戏剧的第三季。不久之后，HBO向我们传来了消息，正如Bob所预料的那样，世界将进入高清和16：9时代。如果需要的话，我们可以用高清和宽屏电影拍摄《 The Wire》的剩余季节。但是到那时，我们做出了集体决定，使用我们磨练过的模板来完成该项目，我们认为我们曾经使用过的结构能够使故事更加有趣，而不是被塑造，并暗示着更具新闻性的渲染。巴尔的摩的意义远胜于电影。</p><p> Just as important, we had conceived of  The Wire as a single story that could stand on its own across the five seasons. To deliver the first two seasons in one template and then to switch-up and provide the remaining seasons in another format would undercut our purpose tremendously, simply by calling attention to the manipulation of the form itself. The whole story would become less real, and more obviously, a film that was suddenly being delivered in an altered aesthetic state. And story, to us, is more important than aesthetics.</p><p> 同样重要的是，我们将《 The Wire》设想为一个故事，可以在五个季节中独立存在。在一个模板中交付前两个季节，然后切换并以另一种格式提供剩余的季节，这将极大地削弱我们的目的，只需提请注意表单本身的操作即可。整个故事将变得不那么真实，更显然的是，一部电影突然以改变的审美状态上映。对我们而言，故事比美学更重要。</p><p> We stayed put and honored what we had already created. As I believe Bob would have, at that late point, stayed put.</p><p> 我们坚持不懈，并尊重我们已经创造的东西。我相信鲍勃会在那晚的时候保持原状。</p><p>  And now comes HBO with the opportunity to deliver the story to a new audience.</p><p>  现在，HBO有了机会将故事传递给新的观众。 </p><p> To their great credit, once we alerted HBO production executives to our absolute interest in the matter, they halted the fall HD release and allowed us to engage in detail. And over the past several months, looking at some of what the widescreen format offered, three things became entirely clear: First, there were many scenes in which the shot composition is not impaired by the transfer to 16:9, and there are a notable number of scenes that acquire real benefit from playing wide. An example of a scene that benefits would be this one, from the final episode of season two, when an apostolic semicircle of longshoremen forms around the body of Frank Sobotka:</p><p>值得称赞的是，一旦我们通知HBO生产主管我们对此事的绝对兴趣，他们就停止了秋季HD版本的发布，并允许我们详细讨论。在过去的几个月中，看了宽屏格式提供的一些功能后，三件事变得很清楚：首先，在许多场景中，镜头的构图不会因传输到16：9而受到损害，并且有一个值得注意的场景。广泛玩耍可真正受益的场景数量。从第二季的最后一集中可以看到一个受益的场景示例，当时在Frank Sobotka的身体周围形成了一个使徒的半身人半圆形的使徒半圆：</p><p>  Fine as far as it goes, but the dockworkers are all that much more vulnerable, and that much more isolated by the death of their leader when we have the ability to go wider in that rare crane shot:</p><p>  就目前而言还可以，但是码头工人变得更加脆弱，而当我们有能力在那只罕见的起重机射击中加宽时，码头工人的死亡使他们更加孤立：</p><p>   But there are other scenes, composed for 4:3, that lose some of their purpose and power, to be sure. An early example that caught my eye is a scene from the pilot episode, carefully composed by Bob, in which Wee Bey delivers to D’Angelo a homily on established Barksdale crew tactics. “Don’t talk in the car,” D’Angelo reluctantly offers to Wee Bey, who stands below a neon sign that declares, “burgers” while D’Angelo, less certain in his standing and performance within the gang, stands beneath a neon label of “chicken.”</p><p>   但是，可以肯定的是，还有其他场景（按4：3构成）却失去了一些目的和力量。引起我注意的一个早期例子是鲍勃（Bob）精心策划的飞行员情节中的一幕，其中韦伯（Ewe Bey）向达安格洛（D'Angelo）传授了既定的巴克斯代尔（Barksdale）船员战术。 “别在车上说话。” D'Angelo不情愿地向Wee Bey求婚，他站在一个霓虹灯下，上面写着“汉堡”，而D'Angelo则不确定他在黑帮中的地位和表现，霓虹灯标签的“鸡”。</p><p>  That shot composition was purposed, and clever, and it works better in the 4:3 version than when the screen is suddenly widened to pick up additional neon to the left of Bey:</p><p>  该镜头合成是有目的且巧妙的，并且在4：3版本中比在突然变宽屏幕以拾取Bey左侧的其他霓虹灯时效果更好：</p><p>  In such a case, the new aspect ratio’s ability to acquire more of the world actually detracts from the intention of the scene and the composition of the shot. For that reason, we elected in the new version to go tighter on the key two-shot of Bey and D’Angelo in order to maintain some of the previous composition, albeit while coming closer to our backlit characters than the scene requires:</p><p>  在这种情况下，新的纵横比可以获取更多世界的能力实际上会损害场景的意图和镜头的构图。因此，我们在新版本中选择了对Bey和D'Angelo进行关键拍摄的两张图，以保持以前的一些构图，尽管它比场景需要的距离更接近背光角色：</p><p>   It is, indeed, an arguable trade-off, but one that reveals the cost of taking something made in one construct and recasting it for another format. And this scene isn’t unique; there are a good number of similar losses in the transfer, as could be expected.</p><p>   确实，这是一个有争议的折衷方案，但是它揭示了采用一种构造制作的东西并将其重铸为另一种格式的代价。这个场景不是唯一的；如预期的那样，转移中有很多类似的损失。</p><p> More fundamentally, there were still, upon our review, a good hundred or so scenes in which the widening revealed sync problems with actors who would otherwise have remained offscreen, or even the presence of crew or film equipment. These scenes, still evident in the version that HBO originally intended to broadcast several months ago, required redress. The high-definition transfer also made things such as Bubbles’ dental work, or certain computer-generated images vulnerable; other stuff held up pretty well in the transfer.</p><p> 从根本上说，根据我们的审查，仍然有大约一百多个场景，其中不断扩大的场景揭示了与演员们之间的同步问题，这些演员本来会不在银幕上，甚至没有工作人员或电影设备。这些场面在HBO几个月前最初打算播放的版本中仍然很明显，需要纠正。高清晰度传输还使诸如Bubbles的牙科工作或某些计算机生成的图像等问题变得脆弱。其他东西在转会中表现很好。 </p><p> This is no poor reflection on HBO’s initial efforts. In traversing 60 hours of film, the HBO production team had done a metric ton of work painting out C-stands and production assistants, as well as solving a good many sync problems. They felt they had protected sufficiently to air the drama in HD and widescreen several months ago. However, for myself and Nina – examining even a small portion of the whole and finding light flares and sync issues that could be better corrected – we were confirmed in our need to slow the process and take a last, careful look.</p><p>这对HBO的初步努力并不算差。 HBO的制作团队在穿越60个小时的电影后，完成了数吨的工作，为C座和制作助手绘制了油漆，并解决了很多同步问题。他们认为，几个月前，他们已经获得了足够的保护，可以播放高清和宽屏的电视剧。但是，对我自己和Nina来说-仅检查整个系统的一小部分，并发现可能会更好地纠正的照明弹并同步问题-我们被确认需要减慢该过程并进行最后仔细的检查。</p><p> Unfortunately, as we have spent the fall in production for HBO, there was no chance we could find time enough to attend to a complete review of the entire series. That fell to a film editor in whom we place great trust and who knows the  The Wire well from his service to it over the years. Matthew Booras took the notes and concerns of the surviving filmmakers into an editing suite and began making hard decisions about what we might live with, what we might improve, and which choice did the least violence to the story when a scene became vulnerable. Narrowing the workload for Nina and myself, he made it possible for us to focus on the handful of essential problems in every episode. The hard work here on our part should actually be credited to him.</p><p> 不幸的是，由于我们花了很多时间在HBO的制作上，所以我们没有机会找到足够的时间参加整个系列的完整审查。那要归功于一位电影编辑，我们对此深信不疑，并且多年来他对《电汇》的了解对他非常了解。马修·布罗斯（Matthew Booras）将幸存的电影制片人的笔记和担忧带入剪辑室，并开始对我们可能生活的内容，我们可以改善的地方以及当场景变得脆弱时哪种选择对故事的暴力影响最小做出艰难的决定。减轻了Nina和我自己的工作量，他使我们有可能专注于每一集中的一些基本问题。实际上，我们在这方面的辛勤工作应归功于他。</p><p> At HBO, Rosalie Camarda managed the synthesis of our late notes with the film edit, and long before Matthew weighed in on the remaining problems, Laurel Warbrick capably performed the lion’s share of the transfer, going scene by scene through the cuts and resizing and painting away problems throughout. The two then worked with Matthew, Nina and myself on the remaining issues, and we are grateful for their patience and commitment to the process.</p><p> 在HBO，罗莎莉·卡玛达（Rosalie Camarda）通过电影剪辑来管理我们的后期笔记的合成，并且在马修权衡其余问题之前很久，劳雷尔·沃布里克（Laurel Warbrick）熟练地完成了转让的大部分任务，逐个场景地进行了裁剪，调整大小和绘画解决问题。然后，两个人与Matthew，Nina和我本人在剩下的问题上一起工作，我们感谢他们的耐心和对这一过程的承诺。</p><p> At the last, I’m satisfied what while this new version of  The Wire is not, in some specific ways, the film we first made, it has sufficient merit to exist as an alternate version. There are scenes that clearly improve in HD and in the widescreen format. But there are things that are not improved. And even with our best resizing, touchups and maneuver, there are some things that are simply not as good. That’s the inevitability: This new version, after all, exists in an aspect ratio that simply wasn’t intended or serviced by the filmmakers when the camera was rolling and the shot was framed.</p><p> 最后，我很满意，尽管这个新版本的《 The Wire》在某些方面不是我们最初制作的电影，但它有足够的优点可以作为替代版本存在。在高清和宽屏格式下，有些场景明显改善。但是有些事情没有改善。即使采用我们最佳的大小调整，修饰和操作，也有些东西根本不那么好。那就是必然性：毕竟，这个新版本的长宽比是在照相机滚动和构图时电影制片人根本不打算或不打算使用的。</p><p> Still, being equally honest here, there can be no denying that an ever-greater portion of the television audience has HD widescreen televisions staring at them from across the living room, and that they feel notably oppressed if all of their entertainments do not advantage themselves of the new hardware. It vexes them in the same way that many with color television sets were long ago bothered by the anachronism of black-and-white films, even carefully conceived black-and-white films. For them,  The Wire seems frustrating or inaccessible – even more so than we intended it. And, hey, we are always in it to tell people a story, first and foremost. If a new format brings a few more thirsty critters to the water’s edge, then so be it.</p><p> 尽管如此，在这里同样老实说，不能否认电视观众中越来越多的人从起居室对着高清宽屏电视，如果他们的所有娱乐活动都没有使自己受益，他们就会感到被压迫新硬件。它困扰着他们，就像许多彩色电视机在很久以前就被黑白电影，甚至是精心构思的黑白电影的过时性困扰一样。对于他们来说，《连线》似乎令人沮丧或无法访问-甚至比我们预期的还要多。而且，嘿，我们始终在其中，首先要告诉人们一个故事。如果一种新的格式为水边带来了更多的口渴小动物，那就这样吧。</p><p> Personally, I’m going to choose to believe that Bob Colesberry would forgive this trespass on what he built, and that he, too, would be more delighted at the notion of more folks seeing his film than distressed at the imprecisions and compromises required. If there is an afterlife, though, I may hear a good deal about this later. And in consideration of that possibility, I’m going to ask anyone who enjoys this new version of  The Wire to join me in sending five or ten or twenty dollars to the following address:</p><p> 就个人而言，我会选择相信鲍勃·科尔斯伯里（Bob Colesberry）会原谅他对自己的作品的这种过错，而且他也将对更多的人看到他的电影感到高兴，而不是对要求的不妥协和折衷感到沮丧。但是，如果有来世，我稍后可能会听到很多。考虑到这种可能性，我将要求喜欢此新版《 The Wire》的任何人与我一起向以下地址发送五美元，十美元或二十美元：</p><p>      As I’ve made clear, I’ve messed with a Bob Colesberry template here, and the man, when passionate, spoke in long coils, building slowly and inexorably to a summation. And yes, eternity is a long fucking time. So if you’ve long wanted  The Wire in HD, unass a bit of coin for a scholarship that honors Bob and supports future filmmakers in his name. You’ll be doing me a small, karmic solid.</p><p>      正如我已经明确指出的那样，我在这里弄乱了Bob Colesberry的模板，这个男人热情洋溢地盘绕着长长的发言，缓慢而无情地进行总结。是的，永恒是漫长的他妈的时间。因此，如果您长期以来一直想要高清电影中的The Wire，那么就不用为纪念鲍勃（Bob）并以他的名字支持未来电影制作人的奖学金而付出一点钱。您将为我做一个小型的业力实体。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://davidsimon.com/the-wire-hd-with-videos/">http://davidsimon.com/the-wire-hd-with-videos/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/高清/">#高清</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/wire/">#wire</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电影/">#电影</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
