The company is promising to pump out process nodes quicker than we’ve ever seen, despite having gone through a recent development struggle. Even with CEO Pat Gelsinger promising more than ever before, it’s up to Intel’s Technology Development (TD) team to pick up the ball and run with it in innovative ways to make that happen. In charge of it all is Dr. Ann Kelleher, EVP and GM of Intel’s Technology Development, and on the back of some strong announcements last year we reached out for the chance to interview her regarding Intel’s strategy.</p><p>有点轻描淡写地说，英特尔未来的工艺节点开发路线图是半导体设计史上最积极的路线图之一。尽管最近经历了一场开发斗争，但该公司承诺以前所未有的速度推出流程节点。尽管首席执行官帕特·盖尔辛格（Pat Gelsinger）的承诺比以往任何时候都要大，但要实现这一目标，还是要靠英特尔的技术开发（TD）团队来接球，并以创新的方式与之并驾齐驱。负责这一切的是英特尔技术开发的执行副总裁兼总经理安·凯勒赫博士，去年我们发布了一些强有力的声明，希望有机会就英特尔的战略采访她。</p><p>  Dr. Kelleher is a long-time Intel employee, going back 26 years and starting in Intel Ireland. Starting with semiconductor research, Dr. Kelleher took roles in manufacturing, rising through the ranks to Fab Manager and then being in charge of all of Intel’s manufacturing facilities. The pivot to Technology Development, as we’ll see in the questions below, is a complementary move that brings together both the experience of development and manufacturing. What I loved about speaking to Ann is the element of quiet but striking determinism in the way she spoke – for as much as the CEO is shouting from the rooftops about Intel’s ability to execute, a few minutes with Ann showcases just how focused the people who have to do the research and development really are and how important it is to them on a personal level.</p><p>凯勒赫博士是英特尔的长期雇员，26年前在英特尔爱尔兰工作。从半导体研究开始，凯勒赫博士就在制造业担任职务，从一个职位晋升到工厂经理，然后负责英特尔的所有制造设施。正如我们将在下面的问题中看到的那样，转向技术开发是一个互补的举措，将开发和制造的经验结合在一起。我喜欢与安交谈的是她说话的方式中安静但引人注目的决定论元素——尽管这位首席执行官在屋顶上大喊英特尔的执行能力，用几分钟的时间，Ann展示了从事研究和开发的人是多么专注，以及这对他们个人来说是多么重要。</p><p>        Ian Cutress: Going through your history, you joined Intel in early 1996, making you a 26-year veteran of the company - an Intel &#39;lifer&#39;! In working up from Process Engineer, to now GM of Technology Development, what exactly has been your journey through Intel?</p><p>Ian Cutress：回顾你的历史，你于1996年初加入英特尔，成为该公司26年的老兵——一名英特尔&39；一生&#39；！从工艺工程师到现在的技术开发总经理，你在英特尔的经历到底是怎样的？</p><p>  Ann Kelleher: Well, I started back in 1996 - maybe I even started a little bit before 1996. When I was in college, I did a Master&#39;s and a PhD - I did it in a research centre in Ireland, which was called the National Microelectronics Research Centre, which was in Cork. Then when I finished there, I went to imec in Belgium and I did a postdoc, and then I returned to Ireland. Then I was leading a small research group, in the same research institute as my PhD, but Intel Ireland was starting up a factory at the time. It was a new factory that became Fab 14. They were hiring for Fab 14, and at the time they basically asked me to come and talk to them, they asked me to come and interview, and I did.</p><p>安·凯莱赫：嗯，我是1996年开始的——也许我在1996年之前就开始了。当我在大学时，我获得了硕士学位&#39；我在爱尔兰的一个研究中心做了这件事，该研究中心名为国家微电子研究中心，位于科克。然后当我在那里结束时，我去了比利时的imec，做了一个博士后，然后我回到了爱尔兰。然后我领导了一个小型研究小组，在我的博士学位所在的研究所，但英特尔爱尔兰当时正在创办一家工厂。这是一家新工厂，后来成为了14号工厂。他们在为Fab 14招聘员工，当时他们基本上让我来和他们谈谈，他们让我来面试，我做到了。</p><p>  I got the job. At the time, I thought I would come for a year. A lot of my job prior to joining Intel was basically writing project proposals so that I would have enough money in research to fund the group that I was leading. One of the challenges in [writing those proposals] was that I always had to write down what my industrial experience was, and at the time I hadn&#39;t worked in the industry. So I would always try and explain all the projects I&#39;d done within the industry. So when Intel Ireland offered me the job, I thought I&#39;d go work at Intel Ireland and industry for a year or two, and I&#39;ll tick that box, and then I’ll go back to research. But I found that when I joined Intel Ireland, and when I joined Intel overall, the pace of Intel was much faster than the pace of that in research, and it allowed me so much opportunity from a career perspective, from a growth perspective, from a learning perspective, from a job change perspective, that it basically really suited me.</p><p>我得到了这份工作。当时，我以为我会来一年。在加入英特尔之前，我的很多工作基本上都是写项目建议书，这样我就有足够的研究资金来资助我领导的团队。（写这些提案）的挑战之一是，我总是必须写下我的行业经验，而当时我还没有&#39；他没有在这个行业工作。因此，我总是试图解释所有我&#39；d在行业内完成。所以当英特尔爱尔兰公司给我提供这份工作时，我想我&#39；我会在英特尔爱尔兰和工业公司工作一两年，然后我&#39；我会勾选那个框，然后我会继续研究。但我发现，当我加入爱尔兰英特尔公司时，以及当我加入整个英特尔公司时，英特尔公司的发展速度远远快于研究领域的发展速度，从职业角度、增长角度、学习角度、工作变动角度来看，它给了我很多机会，基本上非常适合我。</p><p>  I will say over the last 26 years, Intel&#39;s been really good to me. Now I&#39;ve done very well, I&#39;ve worked very hard, I&#39;ve delivered a lot, but I think we were a match. So instead of staying 2 years, I&#39;ve been with Intel for 26.</p><p>我会说，在过去的26年里，英特尔#39；他对我真的很好。现在我&#39；我做得很好，我&#39；我工作很努力，我&#39；我做了很多，但我认为我们是一对。因此，我没有呆两年，而是&#39；我在英特尔工作了26年。</p><p>  IC: After starting at Intel as a process engineer, and moving into Fab management, what experiences from managing the fab side of things translate into becoming the Executive Vice President in charge of how Intel&#39;s future process nodes will work?</p><p>IC：从英特尔开始担任工艺工程师，进入晶圆厂管理后，管理晶圆厂方面的经验转化为成为负责英特尔&#39；s未来的流程节点将起作用吗？</p><p>  AK: I came into the manufacturing world from a research development background, and then when I came into it, I worked as a process engineer first. I then became a group leader, then I became a department manager, and then I became a factory manager. Then I moved from Ireland to the United States, and I was a plant manager in Arizona. Then I became a site manager in New Mexico, then I became head of the Fab, basically a co-head of all the Fabs, and then I co-headed TMG (Technology and Manufacturing Group). So I was in manufacturing again, but now I’m in Technology Development.</p><p>AK：我从研发背景进入制造业，然后当我进入制造业时，我首先是一名工艺工程师。然后我成了组长，然后我成了部门经理，然后我成了工厂经理。然后我从爱尔兰搬到了美国，在亚利桑那州担任工厂经理。然后我成为了新墨西哥州的现场经理，然后我成为了工厂的负责人，基本上是所有工厂的联合负责人，然后我成为了TMG（技术和制造集团）的联合负责人。所以我又开始从事制造业，但现在我从事技术开发。</p><p>  A lot of my time and my journey within Intel, within the manufacturing organization, was that I did a lot of technology transfers. These are technology transfers from Technology Development into the factories. So my life with Intel over the 26 years started in Ireland, and I&#39;ve spent time in California, Phoenix, New Mexico, and Oregon. So a lot of my time over the years was spent such that when I wasn&#39;t working directly on development, I was closely working with the technology development organization, bringing the technologies into manufacturing.</p><p>我在英特尔的很多时间和旅程，在制造业组织中，我做了很多技术转让。这些是从技术开发到工厂的技术转移。因此，我在英特尔的26年生活始于爱尔兰，我&#39；我去过加利福尼亚、凤凰城、新墨西哥和俄勒冈州。这些年来，我花了很多时间，以至于当我不&#39；我没有直接从事开发工作，而是与技术开发组织密切合作，将技术引入制造业。</p><p>  Now, when you&#39;re bringing in, and starting up the technology, in manufacturing, you have to learn a lot about the technology itself. You have to learn a lot about it, how it was made, and how you can set it up so you can ensure that it runs with success. Within that journey, I became very appreciative of the work that the Technology Development organization needed to do. I also became very appreciative of the work that the manufacturing organization needed to do, so that you could get the best of both worlds. So then when I came over to TD, I brought in my skills and my learning from the manufacturing side, and I brought my past learning in terms of all those technology transfers - the time that I spent as what we call ‘SEED’ within the technology development organization. I will say from my life pre-Intel, I brought a deep appreciation for the technical skills. I would say Intel has many of the leading engineers and scientists within the world, so it gave me a chance to bring my experience together so that we get the best of both worlds.</p><p>现在，当你&#39；在制造业中，当你引进并启动技术时，你必须对技术本身有很多了解。你必须了解很多关于它的知识，它是如何制作的，以及如何设置它，从而确保它成功运行。在这段旅程中，我非常感激技术开发组织需要做的工作。我也开始非常感激制造组织需要做的工作，这样你就可以在这两个世界中得到最好的结果。因此，当我来到TD时，我把我的技能和从制造业方面学到的知识带了进来，我把过去在所有这些技术转让方面学到的知识带了进来——我在技术开发组织中作为“种子”度过的时间。我要说，从我在英特尔之前的生活中，我对技术技能有着深刻的欣赏。我要说的是，英特尔拥有世界上许多顶尖的工程师和科学家，所以它给了我一个机会，让我把我的经验结合在一起，让我们在这两个世界中都发挥最好的作用。</p><p>    IC: How would you characterize Intel&#39;s Technology Development Team compared to the traditional R&amp;D that we hear about?</p><p>IC：您如何描述英特尔&39；与传统的研发团队相比；我们听说了什么？</p><p>  AK: Within the technology R&amp;D, we focus on process development and packaging development. The overall R&amp;D umbrella at Intel captures many aspects of R&amp;D: there is circuit design, and there are our labs - and I know you&#39;ve done a past interview with our labs! There&#39;s all of that aspect, but the aspect that we cover in R&amp;D is process development: where the silicon wafers are processed, we develop the next generation technology that gets used in our next-generation products. Equally well, we do packaging development, and that is development of the next generation type of packaging for our products. So between the combination of our next-generation technology and packaging, we&#39;re able to deliver our future products. I view the process and technology, as the heart at Intel, because if we do our job really well, we deliver not just the present, but we’re also making the future. I tell my team that we need to deliver really well the present, but we&#39;re also making the future.</p><p>AK：在技术研发领域；D、 我们专注于工艺开发和包装开发。整体研发；英特尔的D雨伞抓住了研发的许多方面；D:有电路设计，有我们的实验室——我知道你&#39；我已经对我们的实验室做过一次采访了！那里&#39；这是所有这些方面，但我们在R&amp；D是工艺开发：在硅片加工的地方，我们开发下一代技术，用于我们的下一代产品。同样好的是，我们做包装开发，也就是为我们的产品开发下一代类型的包装。因此，在我们的下一代技术和包装的结合中，我们&#39；我们能够提供我们未来的产品。我认为过程和技术是英特尔的核心，因为如果我们把工作做得很好，我们不仅能提供现在，还能创造未来。我告诉我的团队，我们需要很好地交付礼物，但我们&#39；我们也在创造未来。</p><p>  IC: So when we traditionally speak to Intel about future development, they talk products that are coming up in 1-3 years as being very ‘immediate’, then we have research to 5 years out, and pathfinding at 7+ years away. Can you kind of talk about how much mental space each of those take up?</p><p>IC：所以，当我们传统上与英特尔谈论未来发展时，他们会说1-3年内推出的产品非常“直接”，然后我们会在5年后进行研究，并在7年以上的时间内进行探索。你能谈谈每一个都占据了多少精神空间吗？</p><p>  AK: I think it varies in any given week. It also varies in any given 6 months, right? I mean, let&#39;s be honest - when I came over to TD, my entire first 6 months was on process. I gave a little bit of time to the rest, but I was really focused on process development. But within the last 6 months, going into 2022, I’m spending a lot more time focusing on what we call ‘components research’ for our future. Me and my team had a very extensive set of publications at IEDM in December, for example. But one of the things we do in components research is all about the innovations that are enabling us to move the frontier of Moore&#39;s Law. That is absolutely critical. It is absolutely valued by me, and in 2022, a lot of my attention will be in that space.</p><p>AK：我想在任何一周都会有所不同。它在任何给定的6个月内也会变化，对吗？我是说，让&#39；老实说，当我来到TD时，我的整个前6个月都在进行中。我给了剩下的一点时间，但我真的专注于流程开发。但在过去6个月里，也就是2022年，我花了更多的时间专注于我们称之为未来的“组件研究”。例如，我和我的团队在12月的IEDM上发表了大量出版物。但是，我们在组件研究中所做的一件事是所有的创新，这些创新使我们能够移动摩尔的前沿&#39；这是法律。这绝对至关重要。这是我绝对重视的，到2022年，我的很多注意力将集中在这个领域。</p><p>    IC: Semiconductor development has often been quoted as the industry whereby you bet the company in every generation, especially when it comes to the leading edge. It&#39;s no secret that CEO Pat Gelsinger is publicly stating that Intel is going to accelerate its process node roll-out: five nodes in four years, which would be the fastest development ever in semiconductor history. Intel by contrast has recently gone through some of its slowest node development in its history, taking a while to get 10nm into a higher yielding profitable situation with acceptable margins. It seems a large task to go from a historical slow to an industry-wide fastest ever track. You&#39;ve been in this position for 18 months - can you speak to what strategic changes you&#39;ve put in place compared to what was done previously? Which of these execute on Pat&#39;s vision? For example, when we last spoke, you mentioned more &#39;backup strategies&#39; are in place!</p><p>IC：半导体开发经常被引用为一个行业，在每一代人中，尤其是当涉及到领先优势时，你都会押注于该公司。它&#39；It’毫无疑问，首席执行官帕特·盖尔辛格公开表示，英特尔将加快其进程节点的推出：四年内推出五个节点，这将是半导体历史上最快的发展。相比之下，英特尔最近经历了其历史上最慢的节点开发，花了一段时间才让10nm进入收益率更高、利润率可以接受的盈利状态。从历史上的缓慢发展到全行业有史以来的最快发展，似乎是一项艰巨的任务。你&#39；我已经在这个职位上工作了18个月——你能谈谈你的战略变化吗&#39；与之前所做的相比，您是否已实施？其中哪一个是在帕特&#39；什么是愿景？例如，当我们上次发言时，你提到了更多&#39；备份策略&#39；都就位了！</p><p>  AK: I’ve done a lot more than when we spoke last! I have been working with the team since I joined, and I break it down into a number of portions.</p><p>AK：我做的比我们上次谈话时多得多！自从我加入这个团队以来，我一直在和它一起工作，我把它分成了几个部分。</p><p>  First of all, I&#39;m very focused on predictable execution. I bring that from my background in manufacturing, and I bring that from my own core - I like getting stuff done, and I like getting stuff done on time! I was like that pre-Intel, and I&#39;m like that at Intel, so it has a lot of focus. So to then get within predictable execution, we have broken it down into many portions.</p><p>首先，我&#39；我非常关注可预测的执行。我从我的制造业背景中得到了这些，我从我自己的核心中得到了这些——我喜欢把事情做好，我喜欢按时完成事情！我就像英特尔之前那样，我&#39；我在英特尔就是这样，所以它有很多焦点。因此，为了在可预测的执行范围内，我们将其分解为许多部分。</p><p>  I spoke to you before about our risk assessment methodology, and we&#39;re looking at where we need to do contingency plans. Then within those contingency plans, we look at what time it would make sense to execute, how long to continue them without deploying, and what is the right time to cut across and move from the primary plan to the contingency plan. We have had that risk assessment scheme in place since August 2020, and that was one of the actions we have had in place if needed on our P1276, our Intel 4 process. That methodology has been working very successfully for us.</p><p>我之前跟你们谈过我们的风险评估方法，我们&#39；我们正在考虑我们需要在哪里制定应急计划。然后，在这些应急计划中，我们看看什么时候执行才有意义，在不部署的情况下继续执行多长时间，以及什么是从主要计划过渡到应急计划的正确时间。自2020年8月以来，我们已经制定了风险评估计划，这是我们在P1276（英特尔4进程）上采取的行动之一。这种方法对我们来说非常成功。</p><p>  Over the years, we&#39;ve done a lot of work with the ecosystem. But now we&#39;ve also started to enhance that work, and we&#39;ve taken it to the next level. I’ll break it down into our equipment vendors, materials vendors, our suppliers, and our EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool suppliers. We have spent a lot of extra focus in how we make sure we&#39;re learning from the ecosystem - we don&#39;t need to learn everything ourselves, and what is key is that we keep the innovation at Intel in the key places for differentiation. That means we need to get from A to get to B, achieve parity, and get ahead. Then we take what we have learned from within the ecosystem, and build from that. So we have a very active focus on that, and that has been working well for us.</p><p>多年来，我们&#39；我在生态系统方面做了很多工作。但现在我们&#39；我们也开始加强这项工作，我们&#39；我把它提升到了一个新的水平。我将其分为设备供应商、材料供应商、供应商和EDA（电子设计自动化）工具供应商。我们花了很多额外的精力来确保&#39；我们从生态系统中学习——我们不&#39；我们不需要自己学习所有东西，关键是我们要让英特尔的创新保持在差异化的关键位置。这意味着我们需要从A到B，实现平等，并取得领先。然后我们从生态系统中吸取经验教训，并以此为基础进行建设。所以我们非常积极地关注这一点，这对我们来说一直很好。</p><p>  We&#39;ve also been very focused on adopting industry standards. For industry standards, in particular we talk around our process design kits or PDKs, and ensuring they all work with the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) vendors. There are a lot of industry standards out there that we can pick, so we have picked and placed and brought in the ones we need. Now one of the things that we&#39;re doing is bringing those industry standards into Intel, and at the same time, we&#39;re looking where we have the best from our IDM, and how do we combine both of those together.</p><p>我们&#39；我们也非常注重采用行业标准。对于行业标准，我们特别讨论了我们的过程设计工具包或PDK，并确保它们都与EDA（电子设计自动化）供应商合作。我们可以选择很多行业标准，所以我们选择、放置并引入了我们需要的标准。现在我们&#39；re doing将这些行业标准引入英特尔，同时，我们&#39；我们正在寻找IDM的最佳之处，以及如何将两者结合起来。</p><p>  The other thing, and I say this many, many times, is that I work with some of the best engineers in the world within this organization. I also did some organisational structure management changes over the last 18 months. I would say that we’re more streamlined, and very clear in where we&#39;re going, very clear on the mission, very clear and the deliverables, very clear about the schedule, very clear on where we have the opportunities to do stuff earlier. So there is a lot of focus, I would say.</p><p>另一件事，我说了很多次，就是我在这个组织里与世界上最好的工程师一起工作。在过去的18个月里，我也做了一些组织结构和管理方面的改变。我想说的是，我们更加精简，在我们&#39；我们正在进行，非常清楚任务，非常清楚可交付成果，非常清楚时间表，非常清楚我们有机会提前做事情。所以我想说，这里有很多焦点。</p><p>  As well as that, we have that focus on innovation – we’re not going away from that. We’re focused on innovation, discipline around our execution, enabling our risk assessments and contingency planning, getting the best from our equipment vendors, getting the best from our material suppliers, equipment suppliers, and enabling our EDA suppliers. It&#39;s across many fronts. We’ve said ‘here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do, and we&#39;re doing what we were saying’.</p><p>除此之外，我们还将重点放在创新上——我们不会放弃这一点。我们专注于创新、执行纪律、实现风险评估和应急计划、从我们的设备供应商那里获得最好的结果、从我们的材料供应商、设备供应商那里获得最好的结果，以及使我们的EDA供应商能够获得最好的结果。它&#39；它跨越许多战线。我们说过‘这里&#39；这就是我们&#39；我们要去做，我们&#39；我们正在做我们说的事。</p><p>  IC: So is this the Gelsinger Era of Intel, or the Kelleher Era of Intel? [laughs]</p><p>IC：那么这是英特尔的盖尔辛格时代，还是英特尔的凯勒赫时代？[笑]</p><p>  AK: Pat is our CEO, and Pat has done a wonderful job since he&#39;s joined us. He&#39;s been really, really supportive. I know I said some of this work has started before Pat joined, but one of the key things is that he has been really supportive. Part of the focus is that we built a very detailed roadmap on how we get back to parity and get back to leadership, which we shared last July, but that needed money and funding. Pat was very happy to sign the check.</p><p>AK：帕特是我们的首席执行官，自他39岁以来，帕特做得非常出色；s加入了我们。他&#39；他非常非常支持我。我知道我说过一些工作在帕特加入之前就已经开始了，但关键的一点是他一直非常支持我。部分重点是，我们制定了一个非常详细的路线图，说明我们如何回到平等和领导地位，这是我们去年7月分享的，但这需要资金和资金。帕特很高兴在支票上签字。</p><p>      IC: Pat&#39;s vision of Foundry Services, combined with current semiconductor demand requires a diverse portfolio of nodes, not only at the leading edge, but also more commodity notes. Intel is working on 22FFL and a new 17/16nm node, but we see other foundries offering analog, RF, high voltage, packaging, and other optimizations. How diverse does Intel&#39;s offering need to be, especially across Intel&#39;s global infrastructure?</p><p>IC:Pat&#39；s对代工服务的愿景，结合当前的半导体需求，需要多样化的节点组合，不仅在前沿，还需要更多的商品票据。英特尔正在开发22FFL和一个新的17/16nm节点，但我们看到其他代工厂提供模拟、射频、高压、封装和其他优化。英特尔有多多元化&#39；s的产品必须是，尤其是整个英特尔&#39；世界的全球基础设施？</p><p>  AK: I’ll start with saying what I&#39;m very focused on, and then about what I view as my key four steps in enabling IFS to be exquisitely successful. I&#39;m very focused on getting to our leading nodes, ensuring we&#39;re at parity then into leadership on our Intel 20A, and then our Intel 18A. I&#39;m also very focused on our 22 FFL and our Intel 16 - we&#39;re very focused on making sure that that&#39;s ready for our foundry customers, as well as our packaging. Beyond that, there are a lot of other items that could be on our docket, could be on our table, but for me, my first port of call, my first deliverable, is to deliver those exquisite and successful nodes. Then when we get beyond that, we can talk about more.</p><p>AK：我先说我&#39；我非常专注于，然后是我认为使IFS获得完美成功的四个关键步骤。我&#39；我非常专注于到达我们的领先节点，确保我们&#39；我们在英特尔20A和英特尔18A上处于领先地位。我&#39；我也非常关注我们的22 FFL和我们的Intel 16-we&#39；我们非常专注于确保&#39；它为我们的代工客户以及我们的包装做好了准备。除此之外，还有很多其他项目可能会出现在我们的日程表上，可能会出现在我们的桌子上，但对我来说，我的第一个停靠港，我的第一个交付物，就是交付那些精致而成功的节点。然后当我们超越这些，我们可以谈论更多。</p><p>      IC: You mentioned earlier about standardization: using industry standards and then combining that with your PDK. This is to enable something to future IFS customers, but also for use internally. If this is the current direction, why was Intel using so many custom tools inhouse? Also, how has that pivot been to moving from these completely custom tools to something more industry standard that you can promote as an IFS offering?</p><p>IC：您之前提到过标准化：使用行业标准，然后将其与您的PDK相结合。这是为了让未来的IFS客户能够使用，但也可以在内部使用。如果这是当前的趋势，英特尔为什么要在内部使用这么多定制工具？此外，这种转向是如何从这些完全定制的工具转变为可以作为IFS产品推广的更符合行业标准的工具的？</p><p>  AK: If I go back over the years, I think this is more a historical answer in terms of why were we doing custom tools. We were an IDM that was servicing internal customer projects, our own design teams, and thereby over that time we had built a suite of tools that worked. We have progressed on one path, but the rest of the world, particularly those with the foundries, needed to establish that standardized set of tools and needed to put those standards in place - they could go from tech node to tech node and actually maintain those standard for their customers. So I think historically we were in different places, and we were servicing internal versus external.</p><p>AK：如果我回顾过去几年，我认为这更像是一个历史性的答案，说明我们为什么要使用定制工具。我们是一个IDM，为内部客户项目和我们自己的设计团队提供服务，因此在这段时间里，我们构建了一套有效的工具。我们在一条道路上取得了进步，但世界其他地方，尤其是那些拥有铸造厂的地方，需要建立标准化的工具集，需要将这些标准落实到位——他们可以从一个技术节点转移到另一个技术节点，并为客户实际维护这些标准。所以我认为历史上我们在不同的地方，我们为内部和外部服务。</p><p>  As we pivot over to support our external customers (and we had started this pivot even before Pat had announced the IFS), we had started that pivot because externally there was a very large ecosystem which had developed a very robust set of software. It did not make a lot of sense to continue to try and do that and hit the same point for our own internal suite of tools. So it made a lot of sense to start pivoting over.</p><p>当我们转向支持外部客户时（甚至在Pat宣布IFS之前，我们就已经开始了这个转向），我们开始了这个转向，因为外部有一个非常大的生态系统，开发了一套非常强大的软件。继续尝试这样做，并在我们自己的内部工具套件中达到同样的目标，这没有多大意义。因此，开始转向是很有意义的。</p><p>  Now there are cases where we have some unique tools from our past which are a definite benefit to us, which we have held on to, but they&#39;re in addition to the tools. The pivot started in early to late 2019/early 2020 timeframe. It has been very well received internally by our design teams, because it has set the standard for them in terms of things that are not changing at the rate that they had before. It means there is a very clear standard for which they can work to. The ease of use of design is one of the metrics we looked at, and based on all the work that&#39;s been done in our ease of use, we benchmark internal tools with external tools across the external foundry world, and our ease of use has significantly improved. We believe we&#39;re heading towards the best-in-class for that space.</p><p>现在有些情况下，我们拥有一些来自过去的独特工具，这些工具对我们肯定是有益的，我们一直坚持着，但它们&#39；除了工具之外。该支点于2019年初至2020年初开始。它在我们的设计团队内部受到了很好的欢迎，因为它为他们设定了标准，使他们的事情不会以以前的速度发生变化。这意味着有一个非常明确的标准，他们可以为之努力。设计的易用性是我们考虑的指标之一，并且基于所有的工作&#39；我们在易用性方面做了很多工作，我们在外部铸造世界用外部工具对内部工具进行了基准测试，我们的易用性显著提高。我们相信我们&#39；我们正朝着最好的方向前进。</p><p>    IC: We&#39;re hearing of an internal battle inside Intel when it comes to installing and ramping new process nodes between the different Fabs. It sounds like Leixlip/Laim an Bradoin will be the first for Intel 4 production. How much does TD get involved with the roll-out of new nodes beyond the &#39;development&#39; stage? How cognizant does TD have to be regarding resources and infrastructure for where updated nodes and fabs will be located?</p><p>IC：我们&#39；再次听说英特尔内部在不同晶圆厂之间安装和升级新的工艺节点方面发生了内部斗争。听起来Leixlip/Laim an Bradoin将是英特尔4生产的第一款。TD对&#39之外的新节点的推出有多大的参与；发展&#39；阶段TD对更新节点和晶圆厂所在地的资源和基础设施的认知程度如何？</p><p>  AK: There’s an entire process which goes through, as part of our long-range planning, into the decision on which factory gets the next node. I used to run that when I ran manufacturing, Keyvan Esfarjani does that now because he runs manufacturing. It’s technology development, also technology transfer, to the first HVM (high volume manufacturing), so I need to be, and my team need to be, very cognizant and we work hand-in-hand with the team together to ensure the success of the transfer into the first Fab. We&#39;ve always done that, and we already have very active teams with our Intel 4 - that work is well under progress. So it&#39;s not a case of ‘there you go, good luck!’, I feel ownership, TD feels ownership, until all the factories are completely matched and the transfer is healty.</p><p>AK：作为我们长期规划的一部分，决定哪个工厂获得下一个节点需要一个完整的过程。当我经营制造业的时候，我曾经经营这个，凯万·埃斯法贾尼现在这样做是因为他经营制造业。这是第一个HVM（大批量制造）的技术开发，也是技术转移，所以我和我的团队需要非常了解，我们与团队携手合作，确保转移到第一个工厂的成功。我们&#39；我们一直都在这样做，我们的英特尔4已经有了非常活跃的团队——这项工作正在顺利进行。所以它&#39；这不是“好了，祝你好运！”，我感觉到了所有权，TD感觉到了所有权，直到所有的工厂都完全匹配，并且转移是健康的。</p><p>    IC: The development of Intel&#39;s 10nm family of process nodes has been difficult and stretched. The struggles have been noticed, in both product and financials. I know this was before your current role, but could you go into how the development process of 10nm and its challenges provided experience into how Intel might approach similar in the future?</p><p>IC：英特尔的发展&#39；s 10nm工艺节点家族一直很困难，也很紧张。在产品和金融领域，人们都注意到了这些困难。我知道这是在你担任目前的职务之前，但你能谈谈10nm的开发过程及其面临的挑战如何为英特尔未来如何实现类似目标提供了经验吗？</p><p>  AK: If I go to the highest level, 10 nm was basically attempting and aiming at getting very, very aggressive scaling. I think that in the desire to achieve that very aggressive scaling, EUV wasn&#39;t ready at the time when the 10 nm node was being defined. Had EUV been ready at that particular point in time, I think 10 nm would not have had the challenge that it had. Out of that, we took significant learnings - our risk assessment processes as one. Also when EUV became ready to deploy, it was too late to go back and insert it into 10 nm based on the way the architecture had been designed.</p><p>AK：如果我达到最高水平，10nm基本上是在尝试和瞄准非常非常积极的缩放。我认为，为了实现这种非常激进的缩放，EUV没有&#39；t在定义10 nm节点时准备就绪。如果EUV在那个特定的时间点准备好了，我认为10nm不会有它所面临的挑战。从中，我们吸取了重要的经验——我们的风险评估过程是一个整体。同样，当EUV准备好部署时，根据架构设计的方式返回并将其插入10nm已经太晚了。</p><p>  Another key thing we were looking at is building a lot more flexibility in to future process nodes. We&#39;ve overtly said that we will always be on the leading edge of lithography going forward, so we&#39;re designing our process nodes such that if a new piece of leading lithography becomes available and ready, we can cut it in as soon as possible. We don&#39;t want to be in the space where it&#39;s too late to cut it in.</p><p>我们正在研究的另一个关键问题是为未来的流程节点构建更大的灵活性。我们&#39；我曾公开说过，我们将永远站在光刻技术的前沿，所以我们&#39；重新设计我们的工艺节点，这样，如果一个新的领先光刻技术可用并准备就绪，我们就可以尽快切入。我们没有&#39；I don’我不想呆在这个空间里&#39；现在插嘴已经太晚了。</p><p>  So I think there is that 10nm aggressive scaling that was there, but EUV wasn&#39;t ready, and by the time it was ready, we couldn&#39;t cut it in. So basically we have taken learnings around building in a lot more flexibility in terms of how we set ourselves up for future nodes, and as well as that, the key risk assessments are absolutely critical so that you have that contingency plan ready if you run into problems. We&#39;re trying to</p><p>所以我认为存在10nm的侵蚀性缩放，但EUV没有&#39；我还没准备好，等它准备好的时候，我们就不能&#39；不要插嘴。因此，基本上，我们已经学习了关于如何为未来节点进行设置的更多灵活性，而且关键风险评估是绝对关键的，因此，如果遇到问题，您可以准备好应急计划。我们&#39；我们在努力</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/英特尔/">#英特尔</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/执行/">#执行</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/evp/">#evp</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
