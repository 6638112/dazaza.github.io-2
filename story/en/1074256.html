Sharma, an internationally recognized, black-and-white film photographer. He is one of the masters of photography. He founded the India International Photography Council and was the driving force behind establishing 19 August as International Photography Day every year.     His is an exceptional story. One of learning the art, science, and craft of photography back in the days when there were no digital cameras, no in-built light meters, and no way of knowing if you got a good, in focus, correctly exposed photo, until you took the film and developed it (yourself) in the darkroom. You needed to carry a notebook around, in those days, in which you recorded the aperture, shutter duration, and description of each image, so you could, later, go back and analyze what you did wrong, or right.</p><p>我（和无数其他人）学习摄影的那位先生是一位国际公认的黑白电影摄影师O.P.沙玛。他是摄影大师之一。他创立了印度国际摄影理事会，并成为每年将8月19日定为国际摄影日的推动力。他的故事与众不同。这是一门学习摄影艺术、科学和工艺的课程，那是在没有数码相机、没有内置测光仪、也没有办法知道你是否得到了一张对焦、曝光正确的照片的时代，直到你在暗室里拍下胶卷并（自己）冲洗。在那些日子里，你需要随身携带一个笔记本，其中记录了光圈、快门持续时间和每幅图像的描述，这样你以后就可以回去分析你做错了什么或做对了什么。</p><p>  He studied photography when there were  barriers to entry. When you had to spend years in apprenticeship to a master, in hope that he would deem you worthy of his knowledge, and share it with you. He learned his trade at a time when its secrets were closely held, and every effort was made to keep it that way.</p><p>他在有进入障碍的时候学习摄影。当你不得不向一位大师学习多年，希望他会认为你值得他的知识，并与你分享。他是在秘密被严密掌握的时候学会这门手艺的，他尽了一切努力来保持这种状态。</p><p>  On ‘retirement’ he proceeded to give all that knowledge to literally tens of thousands of students, at Modern School, Barakhamba, and at the Triveni Kala Sangam, both in New Delhi. And that too, practically for free. Between YouTube tutorials, the O.P. Sharmas of the world, and the debut of digital cameras, the barriers to becoming a photographer started disintegrating by the end of the 90s.</p><p>“退休”后，他开始将所有这些知识传授给成千上万名学生，他们分别就读于新德里的巴拉坎巴现代学校和Triveni Kala Sangam。而且这几乎是免费的。在YouTube教程、世界的O.P.Sharmas和数码相机的首次亮相之间，成为摄影师的障碍在90年代末开始瓦解。</p><p>     The next wave is coming folks. And with it, photography as a career —  as we know it today — will die, and everyone and their mother will be a photographer.</p><p>下一波浪潮即将到来。有了它，摄影作为一种职业——正如我们今天所知道的那样——将消亡，每个人和他们的母亲都将成为一名摄影师。</p><p>      Already, today, the smartphone in your pocket does most of what I do in Lightroom and Photoshop, in the fraction of a second that it takes to shoot the image. Consider this story:</p><p>今天，你口袋里的智能手机已经完成了我在Lightroom和Photoshop中所做的大部分工作，只需几秒钟就可以拍摄到图像。想想这个故事：</p><p>  One evening in Hong Kong, my wife and I were at the Peak. I wanted to make a photograph of Victoria Harbour just around the blue hour, when people were turning on their lights. I knew in my head what I wanted it to look like — I was just waiting for the right light.</p><p>在香港的一个晚上，我和我的妻子在山顶。我想拍一张维多利亚港的照片，就在蓝色时刻，人们正在开灯。我心里知道我想要它是什么样子——我只是在等待合适的光线。</p><p>  While I was doing my thing, Anvita was flitting around, taking photos of me taking photos, and of what I was taking photos of, with her iPhone. So in due course, when the moment came, it was stunning and I got what I wanted. I packed up and we went for dinner. Throughout dinner, I just wanted to get back home because I wanted to edit the images! I was so excited! Finally, a few hours and drinks later, we get home. My wife climbs into bed and I eagerly go to my laptop.</p><p>当我在做我的事情时，安维塔在四处飞来飞去，用她的iPhone为我拍照，也为我拍摄的东西拍照。因此，在适当的时候，当那一刻到来时，它令人震惊，我得到了我想要的。我收拾好行李去吃晚饭。整个晚餐期间，我只想回家，因为我想编辑图片！我太激动了！最后，几个小时后，喝了几杯，我们到家了。我妻子爬上床，我急切地走向我的笔记本电脑。</p><p>  As I pulled the images out of the camera, I could feel my heart racing. I knew I’d captured something beautiful. Once done with my editing, I sat back and just kept looking at the one I’d chosen to work on.</p><p>当我从相机中取出图像时，我能感觉到我的心跳加速。我知道我捕捉到了一些美丽的东西。编辑完毕后，我坐下来，继续看我选择的那个。</p><p>  “What an incredible world we live in,” I thought to myself, not for the first time and certainly not for the last. The photo was beautiful. Hong Kong is beautiful. The world is beautiful. And, I was a  little proud of what I’d made.</p><p>“我们生活在一个多么不可思议的世界，”我想，这不是第一次，也肯定不是最后一次。这张照片很漂亮。香港是美丽的。世界是美丽的。我为自己的成就感到骄傲。</p><p>    I wanted to show someone. I needed to know that someone other than me thought this was incredible. But everyone was asleep! Then I heard my daughter pulling the door to her room shut. She’d just woken up to go to the bathroom.</p><p>我想给别人看。我需要知道，除了我之外，还有人认为这是不可思议的。但大家都睡着了！然后我听到女儿拉着房门关上了。她刚醒来要去洗手间。</p><p>    I go to her room, she’s all blurry-eyed, half asleep, annoyed that I’m so hyped up and excited.</p><p>我走进她的房间，她眼睛模糊，半睡半醒，对我如此激动和激动感到恼火。</p><p>    She’s interested in photography too, and we often share images with each other. I expected something appreciative, positive, from someone whose perspective I respect and appreciate for its honesty and insight.</p><p>她也对摄影感兴趣，我们经常互相分享照片。我期待着从一个我尊重并欣赏其诚实和洞察力的人那里得到一些感激的、积极的东西。</p><p>  “What are you getting so excited about,” she mumbled, “it’s two in the morning. Mum posted that picture on the family group three hours ago. I liked it already. Let me sleep.”</p><p>“你为什么这么兴奋，”她喃喃地说，“现在是凌晨两点。妈妈三个小时前把那张照片贴在了家庭组上。我已经喜欢了。让我睡觉吧。”</p><p>  I was gobsmacked. Reality check. I looked at the image in the family group, on my phone. It was  spectacular.</p><p>我目瞪口呆。现实核查。我在手机上查看了家庭组中的图像。太壮观了。</p><p>    Now let’s be clear about this. The image out of her cellphone camera was  not as good. It looked terrific in the phone, but seen on a large monitor, at full resolution, there was no comparison, whatsoever. In the iPhone photo, there was not as much detail, a lot of noise, and the colors were off. It was blurry in places it shouldn’t be, it was just messy. At full size, or when printed, Andy 1, iPhone 0.</p><p>现在让我们弄清楚这一点。她的手机摄像头拍出的图像没那么好。它在手机上看起来很棒，但在大屏幕上以全分辨率观看时，却没有任何可比性。在这张iPhone照片中，没有那么多细节，噪音很大，颜色也不清晰。它在不应该的地方很模糊，只是很凌乱。全尺寸，或打印时，安迪1，iPhone 0。</p><p>  But, when was the last time you actually went through a printed photo album? When was the last time you printed a photograph? Forget about printing — when was the last time you looked at a photograph, digitally, on a size larger than your iPhone, iPad, or even laptop? I’m guessing it has been a while. Andy 1, iPhone 1.</p><p>但是，你最后一次真正翻阅印刷相册是什么时候？你上次打印照片是什么时候？忘记打印吧——你最后一次在比iPhone、iPad甚至笔记本电脑还大的尺寸上看数码照片是什么时候？我猜已经有一段时间了。安迪1号，iPhone 1。</p><p>  Even commercially, the needs of industry have changed. Much of the erstwhile printed materials have gone online, and a lot of communication and advertising have become digital. These media don’t  need huge images. For the most part, they don’t need anything over the resolution of an office laptop monitor, which today, is flirting with 2000 pixels on the long side. Any modern cellphone camera would give you a useable image of that size.</p><p>即使在商业上，工业的需求也发生了变化。许多以前的印刷品都已上网，许多通讯和广告都已数字化。这些媒体不需要巨大的图像。在大多数情况下，他们不需要任何超过office笔记本电脑显示器分辨率的东西。如今，它的长边分辨率为2000像素。任何一款现代手机摄像头都会给你一张这样大小的可用图像。</p><p>  Add to that mix the fact that the AI in the cellphone did in a fraction of a second pretty much what I did over a couple of hours on my own. Okay, so the phone didn’t eat spaghetti and drink a couple of beers, but you catch my drift!</p><p>再加上手机中的人工智能在短短几秒钟内就完成了，这与我自己几个小时内完成的差不多。好吧，手机没有吃意大利面，也没有喝两杯啤酒，但你明白我的意思了！</p><p>  So, point one: with artificial intelligence built into current phones, their speed of processing, and the fact that the photography needs of industry are not as exacting as they were in the past, it means that, in many cases, you don’t need to hire a photographer. Just use your phone. Great photography is great, but for most things today, good photography is just fine.</p><p>因此，第一点：由于当前手机内置了人工智能，处理速度快，而且行业的摄影需求不像过去那么严格，这意味着，在许多情况下，你不需要雇佣摄影师。用你的手机。伟大的摄影是伟大的，但对于今天的大多数事情来说，好的摄影是美好的。</p><p>    But what about individual style? Just as Picasso had his own style, and Monet his, so too do the big names in photography have their artistic vision and interpretation that make their work unique.</p><p>但是个人风格呢？正如毕加索有自己的风格，莫奈也有自己的风格一样，摄影界的大牌人物也有自己的艺术眼光和诠释，使他们的作品独一无二。</p><p>  Ansel Adams, during his days as a photographer for the National Park Service of the US’s Department of the Interior, took some incredible photographs. He devised a system where he would ascribe ‘zones’ to different luminosity levels in the scene and exposed accordingly. He was brilliant in the darkroom as well, dodging and burning selectively, till the image turned out as intended.</p><p>安塞尔·亚当斯（Ansel Adams）在美国内政部国家公园管理局（National Park Service）担任摄影师期间拍摄了一些令人难以置信的照片。他设计了一个系统，在这个系统中，他将“区域”归因于场景中不同的光度级别，并相应地曝光。他在暗室里也很出色，有选择地躲闪和燃烧，直到图像变成了预期的样子。</p><p>    One of his most famous photos, called  Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico is of an almost-full moon, above the town of Hernandez. The moon shines brightly overhead, a layer of clouds lies between it and the town, which is bathed in the soft light of the sun setting in the distance. The steel crosses in a graveyard glow in this reflected light.</p><p>他最著名的照片之一是新墨西哥州埃尔南德斯的月出照片，照片中埃尔南德斯镇上空几乎是满月。月亮在头顶上明亮地照耀着，它和城镇之间有一层云，城镇沐浴在远处夕阳的柔和光线中。在这种反射光下，墓地中的钢铁十字架发出光芒。</p><p>    It’s really quite stunning… and  almost didn’t happen – he couldn’t find his light meter. But he knew the luminosity of the moon, and knew what zone he wanted it to be in, so with that information was able to calculate the exposure time of the entire scene.</p><p>这真的非常令人震惊……几乎没有发生——他找不到他的测光仪。但是他知道月球的光度，知道他想要它在哪个区域，所以有了这些信息就可以计算出整个场景的曝光时间。</p><p>  These were the days of those massive box cameras, with the manual shutters and the big black curtain under which the photographer would disappear. So he sticks in his unexposed negative and makes the exposure. There were no dual SD cards back then, so the standard backup technique was to take a second exposure. But by the time he got his second negative prepped, the sun was gone, and he couldn’t take the backup.</p><p>这是那些大型箱式摄像机的时代，有手动快门和大黑幕，摄影师会消失在幕下。所以他坚持用未曝光的底片进行曝光。当时没有双SD卡，所以标准的备份技术是进行第二次曝光。但是，当他准备好第二张底片时，太阳已经不见了，他无法接受备份。</p><p>    But back up a bit. He  calculated his exposure because he knew the luminosity of the moon? WT absolute F?</p><p>但是后退一点。他计算曝光量是因为他知道月球的光度？绝对F？</p><p>  What complete mastery of your field must you have to be able to do that? I don’t think there’s a photographer alive who could do that on the fly. That is what a lifetime of experience is. That is raw, unadulterated genius. You can’t get that off a YouTube video.</p><p>要做到这一点，你必须完全掌握你的领域？我认为没有一个活着的摄影师能在飞行中做到这一点。这就是一生的经历。这是原始的、纯粹的天才。你不能从YouTube视频上看到这一点。</p><p>    Yes. You can buy a plugin for Photoshop that lets you define your zones and will then expose the scene as Ansel Adams would have done.</p><p>对你可以为Photoshop购买一个插件，让你定义你的区域，然后像安塞尔·亚当斯那样曝光场景。</p><p>    Point two: artificial intelligence can recreate the photography styles of individuals, can simulate different lighting, cameras, lenses, and can  even create its own styles.</p><p>第二点：人工智能可以重现个人的摄影风格，可以模拟不同的灯光、相机、镜头，甚至可以创造自己的风格。</p><p>    Now, the thing is, a cellphone will never be able to make better photographs than a real camera, because, ultimately, the thing that is its greatest feature, is what limits it. Size.</p><p>现在的问题是，手机永远无法拍摄出比真相机更好的照片，因为归根结底，它最大的特点就是限制了它。大小</p><p>  The quality of a camera is directly proportional to the size of its sensor. This is the “retina” of the camera, the part of the camera that receives the light data being focused from the lens. A bigger sensor means more information from the same amount of light is captured, so it will have more realistic colors, less noise, greater dynamic range, and all those lovely things.</p><p>相机的质量与其传感器的大小成正比。这是相机的“视网膜”，相机的一部分接收来自镜头的聚焦光数据。更大的传感器意味着从相同数量的光中捕获更多信息，因此它将具有更逼真的颜色、更少的噪音、更大的动态范围，以及所有这些可爱的东西。</p><p>  The size of the sensor on your phone is about the size of a fingernail. On a full-frame camera, it’s defined as a rectangle with a 35mm diagonal. So a cellphone, in the long run, cannot compete with a camera.</p><p>手机上传感器的大小与指甲大小差不多。在全画幅相机上，它被定义为一个带有35毫米对角线的矩形。因此，从长远来看，手机无法与相机竞争。</p><p>  But we’re not talking about cellphones and cameras here. I was talking about photography and photographers. Let’s move on.</p><p>但我们这里说的不是手机和相机。我说的是摄影和摄影师。让我们继续。</p><p>    I recently upgraded from a Canon 5D Mark II DSLR to a  Canon R5 mirrorless camera.</p><p>我最近从佳能5D Mark II单反相机升级为佳能R5无镜相机。</p><p>    In the R5, I can set the autofocus to latch onto my subject’s eye, and track the eye as the subject moves. So if your kid is running across the park, the R5 will focus on his eye, and keep the focus there as he bobs and weaves around other kids, and park benches. If he turns his head slightly, and the other eye is closer to the camera, it  knows to switch focus to that eye.</p><p>在R5中，我可以将自动对焦设置为锁定拍摄对象的眼睛，并在拍摄对象移动时跟踪眼睛。因此，如果你的孩子在公园里跑步，R5会把注意力集中在他的眼睛上，当他在其他孩子和公园长椅周围打滚和编织时，保持注意力在那里。如果他稍微转头，而另一只眼睛离相机更近，它就知道要将焦点切换到那只眼睛。</p><p>  If my daughter is running with my dog, I can specify whether I want the camera to look for her eye or my dog’s (or any animal). The camera  knows how to tell them apart.</p><p>如果我女儿和我的狗一起跑步，我可以指定我想让相机看她的眼睛还是我的狗（或任何动物）的眼睛。摄像机知道如何区分它们。</p><p>  In  a recent firmware (the software that powers the camera, the brains) update, Canon added vehicle tracking as part of the autofocus system. So I can choose “vehicle” from my menu, choose which vehicle, and the camera will ensure the focus stays on that particular vehicle.</p><p>在最近的一次固件（为相机、大脑提供动力的软件）更新中，佳能将车辆跟踪作为自动对焦系统的一部分。因此，我可以从菜单中选择“vehicle”，选择哪辆车，摄像头将确保焦点停留在特定的车辆上。</p><p>    It is only a matter of time when all that AI that is in your phone will also be in your camera. Want that amazing shot from the Peak? Take your shot, and then take the time to enjoy the spaghetti and beer with the company of your wife. Hey, take time for a cigar too — you’ve already got your shot and uploaded it to the family group. For good measure, you also put it on Instagram and send it to the print bureau, all from your camera.</p><p>你手机里的所有人工智能都会出现在你的相机里，这只是时间问题。想从山顶拍下精彩的照片吗？拍下你的照片，然后花时间和你妻子一起享用意大利面条和啤酒。嘿，也抽一支雪茄吧——你已经拍好了照片并上传到了家庭组。为了更好地测量，你还可以把它放在Instagram上，然后把它发送到印刷局，所有这些都是从你的相机中获取的。</p><p>  Come to think of it, that shot from the peak would look amazing in Ansel Adams’ style. You can just do that from the back of the camera.</p><p>想想看，安塞尔·亚当斯（Ansel Adams）的风格会让从山顶射门的镜头看起来很棒。你可以在相机后面做。</p><p>  It’s happening. The professional photographer as we know him or her today is going the way of the dinosaur. Prepare yourselves, guys. Figure out what makes you different, what makes you unique. Find what cannot be replicated by technology — what makes you, you? Build your business around that. Because already everyone and their mother is a photographer.</p><p>它正在发生。我们今天所认识的专业摄影师正在走恐龙的路。准备好，伙计们。找出什么让你与众不同，什么让你独一无二。找到技术无法复制的东西——是什么造就了你，你？围绕这一点建立业务。因为每个人和他们的母亲都是摄影师。</p><p>          About the author: Andy Malhan is a portrait and communications photographer based in Hong Kong.
