But  faced with five antitrust bills that could unwind  what the House Judiciary Committee described as Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook\u2019s \u201cmonopoly power,\u201d Big Tech is bringing out the big lobbying guns.\n Apple CEO Tim Cook himself called Speaker Nancy Pelosi to \u201cdeliver a warning\u201d that that the \u201crushed\u201d antitrust bills could disrupt the iPhone,  according to  The New York Times , and that\u2019s not all:\n \u201cExecutives, lobbyists, and more than a dozen think tanks and advocacy groups paid by tech companies have swarmed Capitol offices, called and emailed lawmakers and their staff members, and written letters arguing there will be dire consequences for the industry and the country if the ideas become law,\u201d the NYT wrote.\n There\u2019s a growing sense that the current administration has a genuine interest in combating tech monopolies \u2014 a point perhaps made most clearly when Biden chose prominent antitrust scholar and Amazon critic Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission.  She was sworn in last week.\n  It\u2019s not unusual for tech companies to dive deeper into lobbying these days, as you\u2019d expect now that they\u2019re the most valuable companies in the world, and we\u2019ve seen their outsize influence overwhelm voters and legislators at the local level before. Uber and Lyft won big  after backing the most expensive measure in California history, using their own apps  as an unfair advantage, and Arizona\u2019s controversial app store bill  mysteriously disappeared after tech companies stepped in. An Apple lobbyist managed to  scare California legislators away from a right-to-repair bill in 2019, too.\n Pelosi apparently wasn\u2019t having it, though, at least not on the call. She pushed back against Cook, according to the  Times\u2019 sources.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:01:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "Programming     My previous article, \u201c We don\u2019t need a string type\u201c, caused a bit of stir. Though the feedback is mixed, there is a common theme of a string being a useful feature. After doing a bit more research I can determine only one thing: most current string types are broken!\n Many of us believe our strings are capable of more than what they actually do. We rely on their functionality without actually checking that its valid. This can easily lead to programs which do not work correctly, particularly with respect to internationalization. In most cases it seems we would be better off without a string type.\n  I looked at how strings behave in a few basic situations. I\u2019ll go over each situation, giving the expected result and some of the actual results. I considered showing a matrix with the results, but since all the tested languages behave so poorly it didn\u2019t seem useful.\n  Using the text \u201cnoe\u0308l\u201d with a decomposed Unicode string \u201cnoe\\u0308l\u201d, I checked the following:\n 1. Does it print correctly? Yes, most languages are capable of doing this. Though the ideone.com interface seems to break the output (so be careful with testing).\n 2. What is the reverse? \u201cl\u00ebon\u201d, correct? Mostly this fails. The most common result is \u201cl\u0308eon\u201d (the dieresis is on the \u2018l\u2019 instead of the \u2018e\u2019). This is what happens without a string class, by just reversing an array of code points.\n 3. What are the first three characters? Mostly the answer here is \u201cnoe\u201d, as opposed to the desired \u201cno\u00eb\u201d. This could easily lead into a big discussion about what a character is, but I assume most people would not be happy with the current result. This is again indicative of a string type which merely treats the data as an array of code points.\n 4. What is the length? The common answer is 5. And yet again, this indicates our string types are merely arrays of characters and not truly handling the text.\n For all of these questions, try to consider what should happen if you were editing this text in your favourite word processor or text editor. I generally expect that the \u2018\u00eb\u2019 character is handled as a single entity. I don\u2019t expect backspace/delete to just remove part of the letter. I expect copying the first three letters to include the accent.\n  It was a bit weird to find out that Unicode has cats in it (I hope you have a font which shows them \u2014 if not, the title of this section is a happy cat and a sad cat, part of the Unicode emoticon set). These characters were chosen since they are outside of the BMP (basic multilingual plane). This spells trouble for languages using UTF-16 encodings (Java, C#, JavaScript).\n 1. Length? Python unicode correctly reports 2. Those UTF-16 languages tend to report 4: the characters require surrogate pairs.\n 2. Substring after the first character? Python unicode correctly reports the sad cat \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings with a half-surrogate followed by the sad cat.\n 3. Reverse? Python unicode gets the correct reverse of \u201c\ud83d\ude3e\ud83d\ude38\u201d. The UTF-16 languages produce invalid strings. With C# I think I uncovered a defect in ideone. It doesn\u2019t even show the invalid string and instead shows no output at all for the entire program! [ ideone defect]\n Languages using an encoding agnostic library, like C++, Perl, and normal Python 2 strings, fail here as well. They ignore any encoding and assume the string is an array of 1-byte code points. Python 3 adopted unicode as the default string type, thus fixing some problems. It appears that Perl also has a \u2018utf8\u2019 mode which fixes problems for these cats, but not for the \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d string.\n  This string contains a ligature character, the \u201cffl\u201d part is a single unicode code point. They exist mainly for compatibility, but they are a good test for case conversion.\n 1. What is the uppercase? I did not find any language which doesn\u2019t print \u201cBA\ufb04E\u201d. Notice the ligature remains lowercase. The expected answer is of course \u201cBAFFLE\u201d.\n Unicode has a special class of case conversion: this single ligature code point is actually converted to three code points. By not following these additional rules, a language uppercase function produces an interesting result: a string converted to uppercase still has lowercase characters in it.\n  A final check I did was to compare two logically equivalent strings with different composition forms. Here \u201cno\u00ebl\u201d is using the precomposed \u201c\u00eb\u201d character.\n 1. Is precomposed == decomposed? The answer is no in all tests. However, several languages do offer Unicode normalization libraries. In those languages the normal form of the strings does compare equal. JavaScript does not have such a library, which is really tragic because it\u2019s primarily a UI language, exactly where\u2019d you want proper unicode functionality.\n It\u2019s tempting to argue that normalization and lexical analysis is not part of the basic string type. But these seem like fundamental operations one would want to do with text. If they aren\u2019t included, what exactly is the purpose of the string type?\n  I encourage you to run such tests in your favourite language. If you are doing work with international text it is vital that you understand what your \u2018string\u2019 type is actually doing. Once you\u2019ve run this you should reconsider what your \u201cstring\u201d type is actually doing for you. In my opinion they\u2019re all broken.\n I admit the correct answer is not always clear. Text processing is a difficult topic, and at the very minimum we\u2019d have to cover grapheme clusters (some string classes expose functionality relating to this, and Perl even has a GCString class). This is beyond the scope of this article, but very relevant for a good string type.\n The point I made in my previous article becomes more poignant. I\u2019d rather have an array of characters than a broken string class. I don\u2019t put any false expectations on an array of characters: the results it produces for the above tests are very logical.

Clinically, the life-long presence of the parasite in tissues of a majority of infected individuals is usually considered asymptomatic. However, a number of studies show that this \u2018asymptomatic infection\u2019 may also lead to development of other human pathologies.\n The purpose of the study was to collect available geoepidemiological data on seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and search for its relationship with mortality and disability rates in different countries.\n Prevalence data published between 1995\u20132008 for women in child-bearing age were collected for 88 countries (29 European). The association between prevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age-standardized Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or with mortality, was calculated using General Linear Method with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), geolatitude and humidity as covariates, and also using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test with GDP as a covariate. The prevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with specific disease burden in particular countries explaining 23% of variability in disease burden in Europe. The analyses revealed that for example, DALY of 23 of 128 analyzed diseases and disease categories on the WHO list showed correlations (18 positive, 5 negative) with prevalence of toxoplasmosis and another 12 diseases showed positive trends (p&lt;0.1). For several obtained significant correlations between the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific diseases/clinical entities, possible pathophysiological, biochemical and molecular explanations are presented.\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis correlated with various disease burden. Statistical associations does not necessarily mean causality. The precautionary principle suggests however that possible role of toxoplasmosis as a triggering factor responsible for development of several clinical entities deserves much more attention and financial support both in everyday medical practice and future clinical research.\n Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by the obligate apicomplexan intracellular protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the world&#39;s most common parasites infecting most genera of warm-blooded animals (more than 30 species of birds and 300 species of mammals). It is the most prevalent infection in humans (estimated to be 30\u201350% of the world population), more than latent tuberculosis which infects about one-third of the human population (WHO,  www.who.int/entity/tb/publications/2009/tbfactsheet_2009update_one_page.pdf, accessed July 2013). The definitive hosts are representatives of the felid (cat) family. Nicolle and Manceaux (1908) first observed the parasites in the blood and tissues of a North African rodent,  Ctenodactylus gondii, and named it  Toxoplasma (arclike form)  gondii (after the rodent host)  [1]. There are three infective stages of  T. gondii: a) a rapidly dividing invasive tachyzoite; b) a slowly dividing bradyzoite in tissue cysts, which can persist inside human cells for protracted periods; and c) an environmental stage, the sporozoite, protected inside an oocyst. The oocysts, remarkably stable environmentally, are transmitted to other hosts through inadvertent ingestion.\n Seroprevalence is a measure of the accumulated exposure during a person&#39;s lifetime in a particular social setting. Most of the more than one third of the world&#39;s human population who are infected with  T. gondii remain asymptomatic because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. Chronic, usually lifelong, infection with  Toxoplasma that is not accompanied with overt clinical symptoms of toxoplasmosis disease is termed latent toxoplasmosis while chronic infection associated with continuous or recurrent clinical symptoms is termed chronic toxoplasmosis (this form of disease is relatively rare in Europe and Northern America). Worldwide seroprevalence of the parasite measured by specific anti- Toxoplasma IgG antibodies varies between 1% and 100% depending on the environmental and socioeconomic conditions, including eating habits and health-related practices  \u2013 , general level of hygiene, host susceptibility, geographical location (geolatitude) and humidity of the soil. The incidence of infection is higher in warmer and humid climates and increases with age  . The lowest seroprevalence (\u223c1%) was found in some countries in the Far East and the highest (&gt;90%) in some parts of European and South American countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an overall seroprevalence of 11% [National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004]; another survey reported a higher number (22.5%)  . Nevertheless, toxoplasmosis is one of the leading causes of death attributed to foodborne illness  . In European countries, the prevalence ranges between 10% to 60%, and in some regions as high as 90%  [8]. In one study, 84% of pregnant women had serum antibodies against the parasite  [3]. Data from 88 countries are presented in   Table 1; most of the published data on seroprevalence are in women of childbearing age and/or those who are pregnant.\n The second and third column show prevalence of toxoplasmosis and prevalence adjusted to a standard age of 22 years to account for variation in childbearing age in across countries (column 1) using the formula Prevalence adj\u200a=\u200a1\u2212(1\u2212Prevalence)\u2227(22/childbearing age)  . Column 5 shows year(s) when the study was performed and column 6 shows number of women in the sample. For Macedonia, the 2004 WHO data were not available therefore this 30 th European country was not included in our data set.\n In the majority of the human populations, the parasite seroprevalence increases with age, and may vary by gender  ,  [94]. Latitudinal variability in the geoseroprevalence of the parasite may be due to local rainy conditions (because oocysts live longer in humid conditions), and low altitude regions (especially at mid-latitudes); a north-south seroprevalence gradient has also been reported in animals  ,  ,  .\n The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis is high in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and transplant or cancer patients treated with immunosuppressive agents  ,  ,  .\n It may be pointed out that the different serological methods used to obtain prevalence data are not standardized, and vary in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. As a consequence, no two tests produce the same results in all cases, even when carried out in the same laboratory  .\n T. gondii strains are highly diverse but only a few lineages are widely spread. Different genotypes of the parasite show great diversity in pathogenicity and drug sensitivity. Some atypical strains have also been detected. In Europe, North America, and Africa, there are three dominant clonal lineages of  T. gondii called type I (RH, GT1,CAST), type II (ME49, WIL, HART), and type III (VEG, MOO, SOU), as well as many atypical genotypes which differ in prevalence, virulence, migratory capacity within the host, and ability to convert to the bradyzoite cyst phase  \u2013 . Different strains of the parasite induce different cytokine responses  , thus triggering development of various clinical and biochemical disturbances in the host, including modulation of the host cell proteome  ,  . Mice fed as few as 1 oocyst of  T. gondii serotype I and several atypical strains died of acute toxoplasmosis within 21 days post inoculation, while some  T. gondii type II, and III strains were less virulent  . In North America, the parasite serotype II and NE-II causes congenital toxoplasmosis, while prematurity and severity of disease at birth was associated with the coccidian NE-II serotype  . This serotype was also associated with rural residence, lower socioeconomic status and Hispanic ethnicity (P&lt;0.01\u20130.001)  . A greater variety of genotypes are found in South America and Africa than in North America and Europe  ,  , suggesting that in these continents sexual replication of the parasite occurs more frequently than in any other part of the world  . This genetic divergence may contribute to the higher prevalence of seropositivity and ocular disease due to  T. gondii, as exemplified by the higher prevalence of toxoplasmosis and  Toxoplasma-induced eye disease in southern Brazil than in any other part of the world  .\n Animals are infected by eating infected animals, by ingestion of or coming in contact with feces of an infected cat, or by transmission from mother to fetus. In humans, cats are the primary source of infection (contact with fecal material), but other pets may also be the secondary source of infection  [3],  ,  [112]. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in the Arctic region proves that  T. gondii can thrive in the absence of cats  [113].\n Contact with raw meat of infected animals, especially pork, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries, such as in Poland, where the majority of pigs, cattle and sheep (approximately 80%) test positive for  T. gondii [8],  . Transmission of the parasite can also occur by drinking municipal/well unboiled and unbottled water containing oocysts, exposure to contaminated soil, contaminated milk, exposure of children playing in sandpits, geophagia  ,  , eating raw or undercooked meat, especially venison   or rabbits  , raw oysters, clams, or mussels  , consumption of unwashed raw fruits and vegetables contaminated with the oocytes  , blood transfusion  \u2013 , maternal-fetal passage of blood cells (including placental trophoblasts)  [123],  , solid organ allografts  ,  , bone marrow transplantation  , allogeneic stem cell transplantation  , sputum  , breast milk  ,  , and semen   (thus, probably the infection may be transmitted via both vaginal and oral sex, significantly more frequently from seropositive to passive sex partner than vice-versa (P&lt;0.001)  [133]). Poor hygiene, lower socioeconomic status and less education, as well as exposure to certain strains of  T. gondii may also contribute to a higher rate of infection  .\n T. gondii is remarkable in its ability to invade a wide variety of host cells. Invasion is an active process relying on parasite motility and the sequential secretion of proteins from secretory organelles, the micronemes, rhoptries, and the dense granules.  T. gondii can invade and multiply inside any nucleated cell type including epithelial cells and blood leukocytes  . A preference to infect and multiply inside myeloid cells  in vitro has also been reported  , and several studies in mice indicate that the dendritic cells as well as monocytes/macrophages function as systemic parasite transporters (\u201cTrojan horses\u201d) during infection  \u2013 . The parasite can be transmitted from infected dendritic cells to NK cells  , and thus, low levels of NK cells found in pregnant women may suggest transmission of the parasite  . Differential infectivity and division rate of intracellular tachyzoites in human peripheral blood leukocytes and other primary human cells  in vitro has been demonstrated depending on the cell characteristics  .\n It is believed that the majority of immunocompetent individuals infected with  T.  gondii remain asymptomatic or have a subclinical course with minor symptoms  . It is nevertheless the most common food-borne parasitic infection requiring hospital treatment  , and the third most common cause of hospitalization due to food-borne infection  . Both competent and immunocompromised persons can develop the disease, especially retinochoroiditis (ocular toxoplasmosis)  ,  ,  . In non-pregnant immunocompetent adults, acute disease may also lead to impaired eye sight  ,  . For example, in the United States, one million new infections occur each year, which result in approximately 20 000 cases of retinal pathology  . Primary infection in pregnant women is a matter of great concern, since it can be transmitted to the fetus leading to spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. A newborn exposed to  T. gondii in utero may develop congenital toxoplasmosis with major ocular and neurological consequences. In immunosuppressed (HIV, organ transplant or cancer) patients, the infection can lead to life-threatening cerebral toxoplasmosis  ,  ,  .\n Symptomatic infection with the parasite can be categorized into four groups: 1) cervical lymphadenopathy, headache, fever, sore throat, and myalgia, with possibility of splenomegaly and brief erythematous (maculopapular) rash; 2) typhus-like exanthematous form with myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, atypical pneumonia and possibly death; 3) retinochoroiditis, which may be severe, requiring enucleation; and 4) central nervous system involvement  [153]. In addition, several reports suggest that  T. gondii infection may be responsible for additional wide range of symptoms, and development of several clinical entities (summarized in   Table 2).\n  Some of the clinical manifestations of  T. gondii infection may be as a result of extensive interaction of the pathogen with approximately 3000 host genes or proteins possibly because of frequent host/pathogen antigen homology that disrupts/creates/triggers host specific metabolic pathways, and finally contributes to the development of endophenotypes of different diseases  . The parasite and concomitant viral and/or bacterial infections scavenge important metabolites from host cells and/or donate other compounds to the host causing unwanted effects. In addition,  T. gondii-derived autoantibodies also play an important role in the pathology associated with the parasite  .\n Due to the fact that  T. gondii infection is omnipresent and associated with development of many pathologies in humans and animals, including the disease burden of congenital toxoplasmosis, as represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALY) being the highest among all foodborne pathogens  , the purpose of this work was to collectively evaluate available geoepidemiological data on the parasite worldwide national seroprevalence variations and their relationship with mortality and disability rates. In the analyses, gross domestic product (GDP)  per capita as a covariate was used because earlier it was argued and demonstrated that culture-level correlations need to be controlled for regional socioeconomic parameters  ,  ,  . If possible (i.e. in multivariate GLM analyses), two potential confounding variables that could strongly influence both the survival of  Toxoplasma oocysts in soil and a course of various diseases, namely the average latitude (proxy for temperature) and the average relative humidity of particular countries have also been included into the statistical models. In this study we found many positive and some negative associations between the prevalence of toxoplasmosis and various diseases burdens. The number and strength of these associations were much higher than could be expected by chance. Still, it must be emphasized that statistical association does not mean causality. Based on the finding of a statistical association between two phenomena, one cannot determine which of them is the cause and which is the effect \u2013 in other words, whether event A causes event B, or whether event B causes event A. Not only we are unable to determine whether event A causes B, or B causes A, but sometimes there is an (unknown) event C that causes both A and B. Therefore, all effects observed in the present exploratory study as well as all suggested biological or medical interpretations must be considered just as potential stimuli for the next, more focused research (search for unknown confounders and for independent evidence) that must follow.\n The data on disease burden, mortality and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY), were obtained from the table \u201cMortality and Burden of Diseases Estimates for WHO Member States in 2004\u201d published by WHO  [323] and available at:  www.who.int/evidence/bod. The publication can be downloaded from the website:  http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html; accessed July 2013). Summary tables present the best estimates of WHO \u2013 based on the evidence available in mid-2008 \u2013 rather than from the official estimates of Member States.  Methods and data sources are summarized in the Annexes of the \u201cGlobal burden of disease: 2004 update\u201d  [323], and the methodology used is described in more details elsewhere  [324]; also available at:  http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/GBD; accessed July 2013.\n The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) has been defined  [323] as \u201ca health gap measure that extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature death and also to include equivalent years of \u2018healthy\u2019 life lost by virtue of being in a state of poor health or disability.\u201d Thus, the DALY combines in one measure the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of \u2018healthy\u2019 life, while the \u2018burden of disease\u2019 as a measure of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. The method of calculation of age-standardized DALY has been described earlier  [323].\n In the literature, most of toxoplasmosis prevalence (seroprevalence) data are available only for women in childbearing age. Therefore, all available data collected for this population were published mostly between 1995\u20132008; the final database was obtained from 88 countries (29 European). When more than one estimation of prevalence of toxoplasmosis was available for a particular country, we gave priority to multicenter studies performed between 1998\u20132004. When the studies published different prevalence data for various regions or different years we calculated an unweighted arithmetic mean. The obtained data were adjusted to a standard age 22 years to eliminate differences in prevalence caused by different childbearing ages in various countries   were kindly provided by Mudhakar Dama) using the formula:\n All statistical tests except partial Kendall correlation test were performed independently with SPSS 21 and Statistica 10.0. The association between seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis and specific disease burden estimated with age standardized DALY was calculated using nonparametric partial Kendall correlation test  [326],   with Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) as covariate. Because the results of similar analyses performed with the General Linear Model (GLM) method were qualitatively the same, GLM data were primarily interpreted in the Discussion section of present study. The GLM is more sensitive for the quality of data (e.g. to presence of outliers and non-Gaussian distribution of data, etc.), however, it enables to control for more than one covariate. In the present analysis, we controlled for GDP, geographical latitude and annual mean of relative humidity of particular countries using data available at  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD (accessed 10.12. 2013) and  http://www.climatemps.com/ (accessed 2.4. 2013). No formal corrections for multiple tests were carried out, however, the fraction of significant results largely exceeded a theoretical value of 5 false positive results per 100 tests.\n The medical importance of the association was expressed as regression coefficient \u2018B\u2019, the slope of the regression line. The higher is the absolute value of B the greater is the positive or negative impact of the predictor variable (here prevalence of toxoplasmosis)\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5168\u7403,global,\u6570\u636e", "title": "\u5f13\u5f62\u866b\u75c5 -

Best to keep a pad of paper and a pencil at your bedside, so you can stab them during the night before they get away.\n   Writing with pen is the first skill you learn in school. It is also one of the most important skills you learn in life, because writing enables you to  record your thoughts and send them to another human. Your thought may effect a person that is thousands of kilometres away, and even hundreds years in the future. Recording thoughts is the most powerful technology our civilization ever created. And without writing, well, there wouldn&#39;t be any human civilization. Writing is here to stay, so we might look at  how we can improve it.\n Let&#39;s look at one specific mode of writing that people often do. You have a problem that can be expressed as an  algebraic expression. For example you are a carpenter and you want to know volume of piece of wood that is 13cm by 13cm by 1m. Or you want to know price of 3kg of bananas if 1kg is for 2.44\u20ac. Or you want to know how much money you&#39;ll have in 10 years when you start with 1000\u20ac and 3.5% annual growth. This is  basic math that you can do with  pen and paper without even using a calculator. However, calculator is equally useful tool as pen and paper because you can think faster by  automating the boring parts. Okay, so let&#39;s look at some concrete example of this workflow:\n  You write down the expression and then you have to  type it in the calculator. You&#39;ll probably do it by writing down  partial results and typing them in the calculator to get the final result. This is a slow process that can be eased by using calculator with parentheses \u2013 you retype the expression  char-by-char and you have your answer. Nowadays people don&#39;t really carry around physical calculators, but we have something  more powerful \u2013 a computer. Computers have  many forms \u2013 one can be a handheld calculator with touchscreen, which you could use in tandem with pen and paper to solve our math problem. Or you know, use  pen and paper that  are computers.\n  So let&#39;s write our problem again. This time with  modern versions of our beloved tools.\n  We have black paper and white ink. Such innovation! But it  looks identical as our first try. Even though we use computerized pen and paper, the new medium acts the same way as one that is 5000 years old. Thanks to  machine learning, computers are now able to  understand our handwriting, so we can enhance our pen and paper to be  smart!\n  As you can see, this isn&#39;t great. The transcribed text has  errors. We tried to write it in  one shot and the handwriting looks ugly, so the recognition result wasn&#39;t as good. Maybe if we try to  write it by chunks, we might get it right.\n  Entering text on computer is usually done with  caret navigation \u2013 a  blinking vertical line designates an  insertion point \u2013 if you press a letter on a keyboard, it will be inserted at that position. With this mode we are  mixing in different input system \u2013  keyboard \u2013 into our pen and paper land, but at least we can write what we wanted... However we lost the original form of our handwritten thought and we are left only with printed characters. We can do a bit better.\n  This was much  better experience than the previous one. And we have  both representations at the same time \u2013 original handwritten form, and also derived printed form that was  generated after each stroke. Even though there was a lot of computation going on during the scribbling, we still  don&#39;t know the answer of our math  question. So let&#39;s try one more time.\n  Finally, this is it \u2014  we have everything we need. We have our  original scribbles, which get translated into  printed letters. On top of that, the computer recognized it is an algebraic formula and  highlighted numbers and operators with  different colors. Not only printed characters, but also individual  strokes. And along the scribbling, we had formula evaluated the whole time. As soon as we  finished last stroke on our problem statement, we already  had the solution.\n   This new kind of paper  understands what you are writing and try to be smart about  what you want. So what can it do?\n it knows  glyphs that are  not on your keyboard, such as these:  \u00f7 \u2211 \u2a02 \u2234 \u2192 \u2190 \u203d \u03b2\n    it has  unit conversion built in, so  3km \u00f7 26m will be evaluated to  4.62km/h, and also you can ask for  m/s\n it knows all  functions ( sin,  cos,  log,  pow, etc.), all  constants (\u03c0, \u210f, etc.), all useful  formulas\n it can  display graphics such as graphs, plots, diagrams, images or even  interactive ball-and-stick model of a chemical compound\n it is  programmable, i.e. you can write your own functions with  recursion,  conditionals and  loops\n In summary, it can do  a lot and it is  useful not only for simple math problems, but it has a real impact on  every scientific field. However it has  one fatal flaw \u2013 it doesn&#39;t exist yet. Various pieces of the tech exist, but they are not yet combined into this new  transformative medium.\n Computational capabilities that were mentioned in the feature list exist in  Wolfram Mathematica. Mathematica is a phenomenal piece of software, there isn&#39;t a single doubt about that. However it has its surface form, i.e. the  programming language, designed for a keyboard input method. Almost all languages for programming computers were  designed for keyboards because keyboards become standard part of computers early on.\n In the rich history of computer science there have been many  interesting experiments that were stolen straight from the  future. One of them was  RAND Tablet. Here you can see a full  demo of this marvel of technology.\n  It can  display and edit charts and also  source code of a program. And all  without any keyboard attached to it! Of course there are a few things that are plainly  wrong. For example, the surface for the pen and screen are separate. This was a downgrade from its predecessor,  Sketchpad, which even today looks like an  alien technology.\n  Sketchpad didn&#39;t have handwriting recognition. All textual input was done by a  keyboard. A  missed opportunity if you ask me. But Sketchpad started a  revolution named  Computer-aided design, which stood on strong graphical capabilities and direct manipulation of the content. Todays CAD systems have great software, but they are running on a  cheap knockoff of pen and paper \u2013 desktop computer with a keyboard and a mouse.\n RAND Tablet had  handwriting recognition that was based on  clever heuristic, i.e.  no machine learning, and it required person to write slightly different than it would normally write with a pen and paper. As you have seen in the demo, the text editing was  usuable, so it wasn&#39;t such a problem. However, if you paid close attention to the meaning of the text, you could see that it was  an assembly language. And that  was a problem. Assembly was designed for keyboard input, so editing it with a pen must have felt  weird and unproductive.\n This gets us to the question:  Are there any programming languages that were designed for pen and paper? Yes, there was.  A Programming Language, also known as  APL. A language that started as a  notation that was designed for  human-to-human communication of computer programs, usualy written with pen on a paper, or  chalk on a blackboard. To be fair, even APL suffered the  transition from blackboard to keyboard. Original notation had sub-/superscripts and flow of the program was depicted with lines. When APL became a programming language, it was  linearized, lost its flowchart-like visual, but kept its  exotic glyphs. This was possible by using a  special keyboard and printer that could print those characters. ( source)\n What set APL aside from other programming languages was its overal  unified design. It was an array-oriented language \u2013 it had the array as a first-class construct. Operation  Array.map that you may know from functional programming was  implicit in APL. Adding 1 to an array of numbers was  same as adding 1 to one number. This array-orientation and  tersness of the notation ultimately led to a much  higher-level operational semantics than other languages had in that era. Today, there is a family of APL languages, but the community is rather small and divided. Some APL ideas percolated down the history to the  modern tensor/array-oriented differentiable programming, such as  PyTorch, with which a computer can learn to recognize your handwriting.\n  It seems that pen and paper will finally get a deserved computational upgrade that was in the works for quite some time. And that is good because it is still  the greatest medium to think with. But there are still a million questions to be asked on how to  properly design it. Is there the one  ultimate notation that can span from children to sciece gurus? Should the interactions and language of this new medium be standardized and taught in school? What would happen if children would use differentiable programming from the start? How can we ensure that the medium would be  proactive in teaching the person? Would simple  collaboration between its users be enough for it? I don&#39;t have these answers yet. But I will try to uncover them by making this  new kind of paper a reality.\n Next post will describe  how to make an app for  offline handrwiting recognition with Google Colab, PyTorch, CoreML tools and Swift.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 10:00:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65b0\u7eb8,kind", "title": "\u65b0\u7eb8 ", "title_en": "New Kind of Paper", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mlajtos.mu/posts/new-kind-of-paper", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65b0\u7eb8", "kind"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "43c5843d5e9acfc5628fb423d622f778.jpg", "infoid": 1067615, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u66fe\u7ecf\u7531\u4e00\u6b3e\u591a\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u4ea4\u6613\u5fb7\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5e0c\u671b\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u7cfb\u5217\u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5546\u6807\u3002\n \u6211\u95ee\u4ed6\u4eec\u613f\u610f\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u8bb8\u53ef\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u5c11\u3002\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u56de\u590d\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u77e5\u6211\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u653f\u7b56\u7981\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u6b64\u8d54\u507f\u6211\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u8986\u76d6\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8d39\u7528\u3002\n \u7ffb\u8bd1\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u7528\u6211\u7684\u5546\u6807\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7edd\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u56de\u62a5\u3002\n   \u8fd9\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u6212\u6307\u4e2d\u670917\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e1c\u897f\u611f\u5230\u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\uff1a\n  \u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bc4\u7ed9\u6211125,000\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e5f\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8610\u5e74\uff0c\u514d\u7248\u7a0e\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7b54\u590d\u3002\u5728Layman\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5c06\u60a8\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u9500\u552e\u5230\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u676510\u5e74\u514d\u8d39\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n \u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u683c\u8a00\uff0c\u8bf4\u4f60\u4f1a\u64c5\u957f\u4f60\u505a\u7684\u6700\u591a\u3002\u6211\u7ecf\u5e38\u7528\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5bf9\u574f\u4e60\u60ef\u7684\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u8bbe\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u505a\u3002\n \u6211\u8c08\u5224\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u64c5\u957f\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u4e3a\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5929\u7136\u7684\u8bc0\u7a8d\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff1a \n\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u5728\u5b63\u5ea6\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6 -

In their response below, you\u2019ll see them inform me that\u00a0company policy prohibits them from compensating me for it, but they\u2019d be happy to cover reasonable legal fees.\n Translation: they wanted to use my trademark and they were offering me absolutely nothing in return.\n   Here\u2019s how they felt about things after 17 months in the ring with yours truly:\n  Not only did they send me a check for $125,000 cash, but I also secured a 10 year, royalty-free license-back agreement. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s the equivalent of selling your car with the condition that you can keep using it for free for the next 10 years.\n There\u2019s an old adage that says you\u2019ll get good at what you do the most. I usually use that as a warning against bad habits, but it also applies to skill building: if you want to be great at something, do it as often as possible.\n I negotiate everything and, as a result, I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it over the years. Some people have a natural knack for it but it is definitely a skill that can be learned. I\u2019ve laid out some of my favorite tips below:\n  The best time to negotiate is at the end of a quarter \u2013 the last few days of March, June (hey, that\u2019s RIGHT NOW), October, and December. Most sales reps are reviewed based on quarterly performance, so they\u2019re looking to lock up as many deals as possible before the quarter closes out. If you\u2019re up for a contract renewal of any sort, try to sign the documents at the end of the quarter.\n It\u2019s worthwhile to note that some companies fiscal year is not the same as a calendar year. If you\u2019re negotiating a major contract, do some research and see where their quarters fall.\n  Never, ever give a target price. If a salesman asks you, \u201chow much are you looking to spend?\u201d you should respond, \u201cas little as possible to get what I need.\u201d\n Target prices allow the other party to quote you a price just below what you\u2019re willing to spend. It feels like you\u2019re getting a deal, but they may have been able to go a lot lower.\n  Email negotiation is more comfortable, but it also gives the other person the time to carefully think about options. It\u2019s also much harder for someone to tell you \u201cno\u201d in person.\n  After they make their first offer \u2013 \u201cI can do this deal for $500\u201d \u2013 you should reply only with a wince (in person) or a gasp (on the phone). Then, say nothing and just endure the awkwardness that follows.\n They\u2019ll soon follow up with a better offer \u2013 sometimes multiple ones (\u201cOK, $400, well I can probably do $350 or as low as $325\u201d). When you think they\u2019ve bottomed out, start negotiating.\n  I\u2019ve been through hundreds of negotiations. If you start at $200 and they start at $400, you\u2019re probably going to end up around $300. \u00a0It\u2019s bizarre, but this is just how it works.\n  This one is huge. Never, ever do their selling for them. \u201cI know your product is great\u201d or \u201cI see that you have features x, y, and z\u201d are things that you say when you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable in a negotiation. Resist the temptation to save the salesperson from the awkward moment. Remember: the awkwardness comes right before they start dropping prices.\n  Once you\u2019ve gotten them as far as they\u2019ll go, make your final offer \u2013 always in the form of a statement, not in the form of a question: \u201cIf you can do $200, I can fax the paperwork today.\u201d\n  Setup fees can almost always be waived. You\u2019ll find that most of these fees are just extra moneymakers for the company \u2013 very few contracts require significant setup time.\n   Getting 1 or 2 months free may feel good, but it\u2019s usually not a great deal overall. The first month free on a 2 year contract is less than a 5% savings.

The company, launched in 2014, has now raised $250 million altogether, including from, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, Temasek, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and Munich Re. It acquired rival SharesPost last year for  $160 million in cash and stock. According to the company, it now has more than $14 billion in assets under custody.\n Prasad and Ramadurgam \u2014 who helped hire Forge CEO Kelly Rodriques back in 2018 \u2014 say they\u2019re excited about that success. They still own a stake in the company; they remain non-voting board members.\n  But after spending 18 months as co-president of Forge at the outset of Rodrigues\u2019s tenure, they left early last year to begin tinkering on a new idea, one that Prasad says is centered around giving a much wider pool of people access to private company shares. Called  D/XYZ (pronounced \u201cDestiny\u201d), the idea is to enable any investor \u2014 not just the 1% \u2014\u00a0 to invest in startups whose services they use and love.\n  Unfortunately, the two aren\u2019t offering much more of a curtain raiser than that right now, though Prasad suggests D/XYZ is neither a new fund nor a crowdfunding vehicle. It\u2019s also not selling any tokens, we gather. Instead, Prasad hints at an entirely new product, saying the company is being cautious in how much it shares publicly because it first wants to \u201cget the go-ahead from regulators, as well as to ensure we have a clear path to market,\u201d he says.\n In the meantime, the two have raised $5 million in seed funding from numerous founders who like the idea of making private company shares easier for their parents, friends, customers, partners, and everyone else who likes what they\u2019re building. Among the round\u2019s participants is Coinbase cofounder Fred Ehrsam; Plaid cofounder and CEO Zach Perret; Quora and Expo cofounder Charlie Cheever; Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra; and serial entrepreneur Siqi Chen, who most recently founded a finance software company called Runway.\n As for some of the nascent startup\u2019s most obvious competition, Prasad doesn\u2019t sound concerned. Asked, for example, about Carta, a well-funded company that helps private companies and their employees manage and sell their stock and options and that has long talked about democratizing access to private company shares, Prasad says it remains very much a direct competitor instead to Forge given that both cater first and foremost to companies, not individuals.\n  And what of SPACs, the special purpose acquisition companies that are moving private companies onto the public market faster, allowing (at least in theory) more people to access high-growth companies at earlier stages? It\u2019s a partial solution, says Prasad. But the way he sees it, \u201cSPACs are more a reflection that people want late-stage access to private tech and their best option right now is giving money to a SPAC manager who will hopefully find a promising company to merge with in two years or less.\u201d He calls them a \u201clayer of abstraction.\u201d\n Of course, there\u2019s also the question of whether Forge will be a friend of foe if whatever Prasad and Ramadurgam are building succeeds. Could their tech be sold back to their first company? Could Forge come to see them as a rival to its business?\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is not competitive,\u201d insists Prasad. \u201cIt\u2019s more picking up the mantle where we left off. Forge is focused on trading, custody, company solutions and data. It has built what some call boring plumbing.\u201d Now that the plumbing has been erected, it has \u201cenabled a lot of other interesting things to be built, too.\u201d\n So is D/XYZ working with Forge in some capacity? Prasad demurs. \u201cPotentially,\u201d he says.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 09:21:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u4e1a,cofounders", "title": "\u8fd9\u4e9bForge Cofounders\u53ea\u662f\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThese Forge cofounders just raised $5 million to work on a new, still-stealth investing startup\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/these-forge-cofounders-just-raised-5-million-to-work-on-a-new-still-stealth-investing-startup/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067611, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "When AMD unveiled &#34;Big Navi&#34;, now known as the Radeon RX 6000 series, the new GPU family brought with it support for Microsoft&#39;s nascent DirectX Ray Tracing. DXR adds photorealistic lighting, reflections and more visual effects to make games that support the technologies look more true to life. However, real-time ray tracing is an intensive task, and high resolution, complex effects can drag frame rates down into unplayable territory even on the most powerful of today&#39;s GPUs. AMD said not to fear though, as it had an upscaling solution in the works that would boost performance, while maintaining high image quality, and now  FidelityFX Super Resolution is here.\u00a0   The focus of AMD&#39;s FSR is to bring a major framerate boost by intelligently upscaling a lower-resolution input, combined with high-quality, high-resolution graphics\u00a0to games that need it. The idea of enhanced upscaling isn&#39;t all that dissimilar to the concept behind  NVIDIA&#39;s Deep Learning Super Sampling. At a high level, both technologies render a lower-resolution image and scale it up to a higher resolution for a sharper, more detailed overall image with better frame rates. While FidelityFX Super Resolution goes its own way without vendor lock-in or specialized hardware requirements, comparisons to DLSS 2.0 -- at least from image quality and performance standpoints -- are inevitable. The implementation, however, is wildly different.\u00a0  First of all, FidelityFX Super Resolution is vendor agnostic and requires no specialized hardware to work its magic. If a GPU can run the necessary compute shaders fast enough, there&#39;s no real technical limitation preventing FSR from being utilized. NVIDIA relied on Turing and Ampere&#39;s tensor cores to accelerate an AI model using temporal and spatial data to weave in detail where it isn&#39;t. The effect is pretty convincing, but it absolutely requires NVIDIA&#39;s proprietary core technology. That by itself has limited adoption. Instead, AMD uses just spatial data, meaning FSR relies solely on information related to the current frame instead of trying to blend multiple frames together as NVIDIA does.\u00a0    We&#39;ve already mentioned that FidelityFX Super Resolution doesn&#39;t require any specialized hardware, unlike DLSS 2.0. The result of that might be the most exciting thing about the technology: it works on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs today. Some of the GPUs in the  supported hardware list are pretty old, and as a result AMD could be bringing some graphics processors back into relevance. That&#39;s got to be welcome news for enthusiasts who can&#39;t find the current generation of graphics cards in stock at their suggested retail prices.\u00a0   The full list goes all the way back to AMD&#39;s Polaris GPUs found in the Radeon RX 400 and 500 series, and GeForce GPUs based on the Pascal architecture found in the GeForce 10 series like the GTX 1050, and later. Even Intel&#39;s chief of GPUs, Raja Kodouri, said on Twitter that the Blue Team would at least  look into the tech\u00a0without making any big promises about what GPUs would support it and when.\u00a0  The other side of the coin is API support. Just like graphics hardware, software support extends back quite a ways. Not only is FSR available in DirectX 12, it&#39;s also available for DX11 games. Open-source APIs aren&#39;t left out of the mix, either, as Vulkan is also supported.\u00a0The only problem is that each game has to add support for FSR, and as of right now AMD hasn&#39;t added a global switch to force the technology on. We&#39;re hopeful that will change in the future, but for now, we&#39;ll take what we can get.\u00a0    AMD has four levels of quality for FSR: Ultra Quality, Quality, Balanced, and Performance. At the top, Ultra Quality reduces the vertical and horizontal resolution of an image by a factor of 1.3. By the time we make our way down to Performance, the input is just half the resolution in either direction compared to the output image, or just one quarter of the total number of pixels. Just like DLSS 2.0, there&#39;s a reduced burden on the GPU to draw a scene, allowing it to move forward and reconstruct the detail. In this table, AMD outlines each FSR mode, scale factor, and input resolution.\u00a0The scale factor below refers to the horizontal and vertical resolution, not the number of pixels drawn. For example, at 2,560 x 1,440 (around 3.69 megapixels), Ultra Quality results in a 2.18 megapixel image, which is just 60% of the detail at the start.\u00a0    A couple of these settings happen to match NVIDIA&#39;s input resolutions along the way. The Quality and Performance modes here match Quality and Performance resolutions in DLSS 2.0 games like  Control and  MechWarrior 5. It&#39;s too bad that no DLSS 2.0 games also support FSR, or there&#39;d be some real image quality comparison fodder. For now we&#39;ll just have to approximate it. While DLSS 2.0 has an even lower-resolution Ultra Performance mode, FSR focuses on drawing more details, and instead has the Ultra Quality mode at the top.\u00a0    After the image is rendered at its input resolution but before the HUD is drawn, the FSR algorithm, accelerated by the GPU, enhances the edges of objects and outputs at the target resolution. After the image goes through the sharpening filters to make objects stand out, the HUD gets applied at the target resolution, so that it doesn&#39;t look fuzzy or stretched.\u00a0   Because the scaling factors stretch so far downward, the expected performance improvement is pretty stratospheric.  AMD says that on average, enthusiasts can expect a 2.4x performance uplift -- more than double the frame rate -- from the Performance setting. This will improve performance when hefty effects are enabled, allow gamers to get the most from their high-refresh FreeSync displays, and could potentially make games playable on hardware that might not otherwise run it smoothly, something we&#39;ll investigate on the next page.\u00a0  Whatever the case and however you want to count the pixels, the next step in the process is to upscale the image. AMD says its upscaling process employs an &#34;advanced edge reconstruction&#34; algorithm, which is based on the spatial data before it goes to the render pipeline.\u00a0Let&#39;s take this native 4K image from Counterplay Games&#39;\u00a0 Godfall as a starting point. We captured all these images on a  Radeon RX 6800 XT, but it should be noted that the image quality on the NVIDIA side is pretty much identical to our eyes.\u00a0    In the native image, everything is what we&#39;d expect. Objects are sharp and well-defined as they should be in on an 8MP display. Let&#39;s take a look at what Ultra Quality does to that image when it&#39;s rendered at 2,953 x 1,662 and then upscaled up to 4K.    Without blowing the image up to 2x to find all the hard edges, or swapping back and forth between images, we&#39;re actually quite hard-pressed to find glaring differences. The stairs are a little more blurry, and perhaps there&#39;s not quite as much detail in the character&#39;s hair, but in motion it&#39;s basically indistinguishable.   Folks who are sensitive to DLSS 2.0&#39;s temporal artifacts (which we feel are pretty mild and are likely to go unnoticed by many gamers) won&#39;t find anything like that here, because FSR relies solely on spatial data -- the graphics driver knows where objects are in relation to the camera as part of the scene. We can see in still images that there&#39;s a little bit of difference in the image quality at 4K, but we&#39;re hard pressed to find it when the game is moving. If there&#39;s much of a performance boost, which we&#39;ll look into soon, enabling FSR at the Ultra Quality setting seems like a no-brainer in the games that will support it.\u00a0  Next up, let&#39;s jump to the other end of the spectrum and see what Performance FSR looks like. On a 4K UHD display, we&#39;re talking about a 1080p image, and on a 1440p monitor we&#39;re down to just 720p&#39;s worth of pixels at render time.\u00a0   Godfall is just one of the games getting FidelityFX Super Resolution support today. The full list includes seven launch titles in all:  22 Racing Series,  Anno 1800,  Evil Genius 2,  Godfall,  KingsHunt,  Terminator: Resistance, and  The Riftbreaker. Some of these titles, like  The Riftbreaker, are early access titles, but Anno 1800 has been around for a while and picks up FSR support post-launch.\u00a0  There are still two other settings we haven&#39;t looked at. For reasons that will become obvious on the next page, we&#39;re going to check out Quality next. As we mentioned, the 2,560 x 1,440 image produced by the FSR Quality mode matches DLSS 2.0&#39;s Quality mode&#39;s render resolution. Let&#39;s take a closer look at the image.\u00a0    This is really the point where AMD&#39;s and NVIDIA&#39;s super scaling solutions should be compared, but that&#39;s not really possible until a game supports both technologies. Instead we can say that overall, it feels like FSR produces a softer image at the Quality setting than DLSS 2.0 does. Here&#39;s an example, and we&#39;ll start with FSR. If we really dig into the image here, it feels like our character on the left and the obelisk on the right are slightly out of focus. In motion, the game never feels that way because of constant motion, but in the still image it&#39;s apparent. For contrast, let&#39;s take a look at this scene from Remedy&#39;s  Control  rendered at 4K UHD on a  GeForce RTX 3070 with Quality DLSS 2.0. It has the same input resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 before upscaling, and we&#39;ve cropped it to 1080p the same as we did with\u00a0 Godfall.    It looks to us like Jessie Faden and her surroundings are a bit sharper and more in-focus in this image than the scenery in  Godfall,\u00a0but again in motion it&#39;s not as apparent.\u00a0As we can see there are pros and cons to both approaches. DLSS 2.0 is sharper but hardware support is more limited, while FidelityFX Super Resolution seems a bit softer, but has much wider hardware support. Going forward we&#39;re hoping to see both technologies supported in a single game so we can really make a true apples-to-apples comparison between the two.\u00a0  Lastly is the Balanced setting. This renders around half-way between Quality and Performance, and renders at a resolution (2,259 x 1,270 when targeting 4K) that is  just\u00a0a bit higher than DLSS 2.0&#39;s Balanced mode (which renders at 2,227 x 1,253 with the same target).\u00a0    When targeting 4K with Balanced settings, AMD&#39;s goal was to provide better image quality than 1080p while providing better performance than rendering 1440p. With a target resolution right in between the two, it should be pretty easy to hit that goal. The level of detail is better than it would have been at 1080p as well, though it can&#39;t put back all the detail that&#39;s missing from a higher resolution. The image is softer than either of the Quality settings, too, so it&#39;s just one more step in a series of trade-offs. The best way to determine which setting to use with FSR is to play the game and experiment on your hardware, but we&#39;ll do some investigation of our own on the next page.\u00a0  That&#39;s a whole lot, but we&#39;ll do our best here to sum it up: thanks to the spatial data collected by AMD&#39;s algorithms, Quality FSR at 4K, which renders at 1440p, has even a smidge more detail than native 1440p rendering, because edges of objects get smoothed out. We still have to investigate performance, but the image quality trade-offs are something we think gamers will be happy to live with. The old saying goes that &#34;something is better than nothing&#34; but in this case, AMD&#39;s something is pretty solid, especially because it feels like it was built for lower-end hardware. In this era of shortages and high prices, hungry gamers will eat it up if it means they can play games at higher resolutions at the cost of a bit of detail.\u00a0  AMD says FSR is easy to integrate, as the company intends to make the shader source code available as part of the  GPUOpen project under the permissive MIT open-source software license. The company expects source to be published sometime in mid-July. While AMD points out that FSR doesn&#39;t use temporal data or specialized hardware, there&#39;s no per-game training required, it&#39;s also important to note that DLSS 2.0 -- which does use temporal data -- no longer requires per-game training, either.\u00a0    There are seven games that support FSR today. Those games are  22 Racing Series,  Anno 1800,  Evil Genius 2,  Godfall,  KingsHunt,  Terminator: Resistance, and  The Riftbreaker. Ubisoft&#39;s  Anno 1800 has been around for a while, originally released in April of 2019. Some of the other titles are much newer and, like  The Riftbreaker, are still in an early access stage. We&#39;d love to see other game makers take Ubisoft&#39;s example and bring FSR to older titles, particularly those that stress the graphics card.\u00a0    On top of that, there are 12 other games already confirmed for FSR, including huge high-profile titles like  FarCry 6, Farming Simulator 22,\u00a0 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3,\u00a0 Dota 2, and\u00a0 Resident Evil Village. In total, around 40 developers have signed on to support FSR in their upcoming titles. Those studios include Capcom, Obsidian Entertainment, Ubisoft, and Valve. On top of that, Microsoft\u00a0 has already confirmed\u00a0that FidelityFX Super Resolution will be coming to the Xbox Series S and Series X, too.\u00a0  Let&#39;s check out some performance next...",

", "note_en": "In a bid to bolster its claims as a crime-fighting tool, Ring deployed a tactic popular in the business world: influencer marketing. It selected a cadre of brand ambassadors, rewarded them with free gadgets and discount codes, and urged them to use their connections to promote the Santa Monica security camera startup via word of mouth.\n  \u201cYou are killing it, by the way. Your code has 14 uses, eleven more and I will be sending you every device that we sell,\u201d a Ring employee wrote to one officer in a 2016 email. \u201cDo you have any community meetings or crime prevention fairs coming up?\u201d\n Ring provided at least 100 LAPD officers with one or more free devices or discount codes and encouraged them to recommend the company\u2019s web-connected doorbells and security cameras, emails reviewed by The Times reveal. In more than 15 cases, emails show that officers who received free gadgets or discounts promoted Ring products to fellow police officers or members of the public.\n  For Ring, turning police into brand ambassadors helped spur the adoption of Ring doorbells while lending credibility to the company\u2019s claims that it was an effective crime-reduction solution.\n In return, participating officers got tens of thousands of dollars worth of free and discounted electronics and helped establish a network of personal surveillance cameras that the LAPD could tap into with much less red tape than the typical means of obtaining video footage.\n The practice, privacy and criminal justice experts warn, raises the question of whether LAPD officers were serving the public in their interactions with Ring, or if they were serving a private business and themselves.\n LAPD rules restrict the acceptance of gifts that could be seen as an attempt to influence the actions of officers. After a preliminary review of the emails, the department said officers did not appear to have violated agency rules.\n  An agency spokesperson said that although accepting free devices and personally recommending those products to community members did not violate the LAPD code of ethics, a paid endorsement would run afoul of agency rules.\n \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar, a spokesperson for the LAPD, said in a statement. \u201cIf there is something brought to the department\u2019s attention which appears to be misconduct, it will be referred to Professional Standards Bureau for investigation.\u201d\n It\u2019s unclear whether LAPD officers disclosed their arrangements with Ring to the public or fellow officers.\n Ring ended its law enforcement ambassador program, called Pillar, in 2019 and now works directly with community organizations, said Emma Daniels, a spokesperson for Ring, which Amazon acquired in 2018.\n  \u201cRing stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago,\u201d Daniels said in a statement. \u201cAs Ring has grown, our practices have evolved, and we are always looking for ways to better serve our customers and their communities.\u201d\n The Times reached out to each officer named in this story directly or through the union and the Police Department and did not receive any response by the time of publication.\n Tony Cheng, an assistant professor at UC Irvine\u2019s Department of Criminology, Law and Society, warned that the public probably would be unable to make a distinction between a personal recommendation from an officer who received a free or discounted Ring product and a paid endorsement. \u201cThat seems to be splitting hairs,\u201d Cheng said.\n The practice, he said, is a cause for concern both substantively and symbolically \u2014 freebies from private companies could give officers motives other than public service, and they could give the public the impression that recommendations from officers can\u2019t be trusted.\n  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be put in the position to have to question or be skeptical about the quality of public safety advice that they\u2019re giving out in meetings, for example, which could be compromised by these private partnerships,\u201d Cheng said.\n  The brand ambassador model is simple. Give free merchandise to influential individuals, and turn them into a low-cost marketing team.\n Some brands court celebrities with huge followings; others look to people who aren\u2019t necessarily famous yet have influence in their own communities. A makeup artist with a social media presence might receive swag for posting about new eyeshadow palettes. A runner might get free shoes for talking about footwear on Facebook. And stylish Instagram users might land freebies if their feed has the right look.\n It\u2019s less common, however, for public servants to participate in the brand ambassador model.\n  Ring began its outreach to the LAPD during a period of growth. Founded in the Pacific Palisades garage of Jamie Siminoff in 2012, Ring was proving wrong critics who had doubted the startup during an appearance on the TV show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d As e-commerce took off and concerns about porch theft rose with it, consumers embraced Ring and other video doorbells. By 2016, the company had an estimated $155 million in sales, commanding 80% of the global video doorbell market. It was valued at $460 million, had amassed $209 million in venture capital funding and Siminoff, at the time, was eyeing a potential initial public offering of stock.\n  But Ring wasn\u2019t profitable. The company was also having  trouble proving definitively that its products helped reduce crime in neighborhoods \u2014 a marketing promise it sought to validate by working with the LAPD, among other police departments.\n Emails from 2016 reviewed by The Times and released via a public records request show that Ring deployed a standard playbook as it approached officers across LAPD stations.\n  Often, Ring would make contact with an officer at an event or through introductions from fellow police. Then came a follow-up, with a request for a phone call to discuss ways to \u201creduce crime\u201d in their neighborhoods. Finally, Ring thanked the officer for the call and said a free product was on its way.\n In at least 24 cases, Ring emailed a discount code and encouraged an officer to share it with colleagues, prominent local individuals such as heads of neighborhood associations and residents of the communities they police.\n Ring\u2019s goal when sending free devices to officers was to let them experience it so they could \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods, spreading the word to HOA\u2019s, meeting groups, on Nextdoor, and at public safety meetings,\u201d one email from the company read.\n The LAPD\u2019s  code of ethics prohibits officers from accepting \u201cany gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business\u201d or using \u201ctheir position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others.\u201d\n  The LAPD said using discount codes is \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics.\u201d Aguilar also said recommending ways for community members to protect themselves is among the responsibilities of senior lead officers or officers in community relations positions \u2014 titles held by some of the officers named in this story who accepted free or discounted devices.\n  Although it\u2019s common for community members to ask officers for recommendations, Cheng, the UC Irvine professor, argues it\u2019s up to the officer to \u201cexercise restraint, according to the code of ethics.\u201d Officers could recommend security systems broadly, said Cheng, who reviewed some of the emails and pointed out that officers didn\u2019t just answer questions about recommendations, but proactively steered the public toward Ring.\n Ring quickly made inroads in the department, communicating with at least 125 officers in 2016.\n  In April of that year, after hearing about arrangements Ring made with other members of the LAPD, Officer Eric Mollinedo from the Olympic division emailed Ring\u2019s director of operations, August Cziment, asking for promo codes as well as information about receiving a unit for his home. Mollinedo said he\u2019d be manning a booth at an upcoming public safety fair. Cziment said Ring would get him \u201cgoing with flyers, as well as a unit.\u201d Ring also provided Mollinedo a coupon code and encouraged him to distribute it to his colleagues.\n After the fair, Mollinedo emailed Ring to let the company know the event was a success. \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair ... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n In at least 10 cases, officers invited Ring to community events or offered to schedule meetings at their stations primarily for the purpose of allowing company representatives to talk up products and hand out discount codes.\n That same month, Sgt. Justin Scott exchanged a series of emails with Cziment about an offer for a free stick-up camera. Ring asked him to share the offer with his entire West L.A. station. Scott agreed, saying he\u2019d keep the option to sign up for the free camera open for a month, and in that same message asked if he could get a replacement for a friend\u2019s Ring device \u201cthat appears defective.\u201d\n  Later that month, Scott ran promotional language by the company before sending it to fellow officers, emailing Cziment a block of text about the stick-up camera offer for his approval. Cziment replied, \u201cLooks great! Keep me updated on how it all goes.\u201d\n Of the 60 officers who responded to Scott\u2019s email asking for a free stick-up camera, four asked if they could also receive the Ring doorbell that the company gave out for free months prior because they had missed the opportunity at that time. At least three others asked for free stick-up cameras for other officers who didn\u2019t sign up in time. One asked for discounts for family members.\n At the time, the device retailed for $199, amounting to a conservative estimate of at least $12,000 in free hardware doled out at just one station.\n Requests for freebies kept coming. In one case, Officer Maria Gray, who was among the West L.A. police to receive a free stick-up camera, emailed Cziment to invite him to an upcoming station family picnic.\n  \u201cWe have a favor to ask... Every year, we have a West LA Division Beach party.... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d\n Cziment wrote: \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Police invitations also extended to the top of the company: Siminoff, Ring\u2019s chief executive, attended a 2016 police academy graduation as a guest of then-LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.\n  Ring also encouraged officers to promote its products to residents of the communities they policed. The goal was to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods,\u201d read one email from Ring offering a free device for an officer to try in his home.\n  Ring asked officers to help with its \u201cNeighborhood Pillar\u201d program, enlisting its LAPD contacts to \u201ceducate members of the community on the benefits of Ring\u201d by handing out promo codes and fliers to so-called pillars \u2014 \u201cinfluential people in the community that care about crime prevention safety.\u201d For every 10 uses of the code, the pillar would get a free Ring device.\n Community members Ring considered \u201cinfluential\u201d included neighborhood watch captains or presidents, one email showed. If the officers didn\u2019t know anyone who fit the bill, Ring invited the officers to take on the role of the pillar.\n  In an April 2016 email, Officer Evening Wight said a sergeant in her station had given her permission to share a Ring promo code, but \u201cshe cautioned me to word the email so that it won\u2019t appear that we are endorsing the product, merely offering it as an option among others for home security.\u201d\n  In a May 2016 email, Officer Javier Segovia said his sergeant and captain wanted Ring representative Phillip Dienstag to talk about Ring at an upcoming community meeting. But Segovia \u2014 who according to the emails had days prior received and installed a free Ring doorbell \u2014 advised that because the meeting was going to be held on city of Los Angeles property, the company would not be able to discuss \u201cpricing during the meeting.\u201d Instead, he wrote in the email, Dienstag would be able to \u201ctalk to the community on the side regarding pricing.\u201d\n Others went further in endorsing Ring to community members. Officer Alejandro Galvan said he was keeping an eye on his older neighbors, who were \u201cleery\u201d of technology, to see when their adult children would visit so he could talk them into persuading their parents to use a Ring device.\n &#34;(Psss, the weirdos have flip phones),\u201d Galvan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m thinking their kids might be able to \u2018intervene.\u2019\u201d\n In an email connecting Cziment with the head of the South Brentwood Residents Assn. at Ring\u2019s request, Gray \u2014 the officer who had invited Ring to the station family picnic \u2014 asked if the neighborhood group could find a way to work with the company. \u201cOur detectives use and support this product,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be more than welcome to attend and help facilitate any meetings. I completely believe in and support this product!\u201d\n    By 2019, the brand ambassador model had evolved. Ring no longer encouraged officers to promote its products with the promise of free or discounted merchandise. Instead, there was a new incentive for officers: growing the network of surveillance devices that they could access more easily than typical security cameras.\n Ring at the time was trying to grow its app, called Neighbors. For consumers, the service works much like the community message board NextDoor but with an even greater focus on crime. Residents can share and comment on suspicious or suspected activity in their communities and also post footage from their own cameras.\n For law enforcement organizations, the app is an investigative tool. The app is given to law enforcement and public safety agencies free of charge, according to Ring\u2019s website. Officers get crime alerts sent to their inbox, and they can batch download or send mass requests to users for footage directly through the app. It featured an interactive map of all Ring devices in the area; Ring says it discontinued that service in 2019. In response to specific police data requests, consumers can consent to sharing their footage with investigators.\n   Aguilar said the LAPD and Ring do not have a formal contract. Terms for similar partnerships in other parts of the country show that as part of the agreement to use the law enforcement portal, officers have been required to \u201cencourage adoption of the platform/app,\u201d in their communities,  Motherboard reported.\n Emails to LAPD officers show Ring leaned on the brand ambassador model to grow its app. After installing the law enforcement portal, Ring instructed officers to ask community members to join the platform because it \u201cgrows in value with each resident that downloads the app.\u201d\n  Obtaining surveillance footage can be a cumbersome process. It can require knocking on doors and asking for permission from the owners of individual cameras, or at times seeking a warrant \u2014 which brings a level of transparency and judicial oversight. Using Ring\u2019s vast network, officers could instead request and obtain footage with a few clicks. Emails to Ring show LAPD officers requested access to the company\u2019s investigative tool as soon as it was available to them, praised it and quickly put it to use.\n  \u201cNo more going door to  door to look for cameras and asking for footage,\u201d  Ring\u2019s instructional video shared with police departments states.\n In June 2020, some Ring users received an email notifying them that LAPD Det. Gerry Chamberlain was seeking video recordings from the Black Lives Matter protests, emails disclosed via a  public records request filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation show. During the protests, the notification read, individuals were injured and property was damaged and police were trying to find out who was responsible.\n  It was not immediately clear how many users received that notification, where exactly the LAPD was seeking video recordings, and how much material the agency ultimately obtained. By requesting video recordings directly from users, the LAPD avoided the multi-step process of securing a warrant or a subpoena to obtain footage from the vast network of personally owned cameras.\n  The LAPD said it keeps no record of when and how often officers make requests of Ring users.\n After The Times reached out to Ring for comment on this story, the company  announced that it changed its policies and now requires police to make requests for video from users in a public forum. \u201cThis way, anyone interested in knowing more about how their police agency is using Request for Assistance posts can simply visit the agency\u2019s profile and see the post history,\u201d the blog post read.\n In response to The Times\u2019 public records request, the LAPD said that it would be \u201cunduly burdensome\u201d to try to determine how often its officers requested or received video from Ring cameras.\n Consumers have embraced doorbell cameras as a useful tool for both home security and convenience. But Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, warns of the dangers posed by this private surveillance apparatus, including a potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected freedoms.\n   Experts and activists have for years expressed concerns about the disproportionate effects of surveillance technology on people of color, and further reductions in transparency, she said, could lead to dragnet-style approaches and mass privacy violations.\n \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d\n The lack of transparency is further cause for concern, Electronic Frontier Foundation policy analyst Matthew Guariglia said, because Ring and police departments could be using fear to sell more devices and expand their surveillance powers. In a  letter sent to the California attorney general last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation asked the state Department of Justice to investigate Ring\u2019s relationship with the 145 police departments across California with which it has partnered.\n  \u201cThese partnerships and these relationships blur the boundaries so that people no longer know if they have a real reason to be afraid in their neighborhood or if the police who come to their door and recommend they adopt the Ring or subsidize the cost of Ring just benefit from that relationship,\u201d Guariglia said.\n  11:45 AM, Jun. 17, 2021: This story was updated to note that Ring said it stopped providing law enforcement clients with an interactive map of Ring devices in 2019.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 09:13:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u8b66\u5bdf,gave,\u6212\u6307", "title": "\u6212\u6307\u66fe\u7ecf\u4e3a100\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u8b66\u5bdf\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u6444\u50cf\u5934 ", "title_en": "Ring Once Gave Free Cameras to 100 Los Angeles Police Officers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u8b66\u5bdf", "gave", "\u6212\u6307"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067609, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u5b66\u4e60c\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; vere\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4e66\u3002  \u5728\u53ea\u662f\u51e0\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6211\uff06\uff0339; ll\u6559\u4f60\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528c\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; ll\u5f00\u59cb\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002  \u6cbf\u7740\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; ll\u4e86\u89e3Lisps\u7684\u5947\u602a\u548c\u7f8e\u5999\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u7b80\u660e\u627c\u8981\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5199\u51fa\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff01  \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u662f\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9605\u8bfb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a6c\u4e0a\u5f00\u59cb\uff01 \u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u60f3\u8981\u5c55\u793a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u60f3\u8981\u6700\u597d\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u5370\u5237\u683c\u5f0f\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u4e66\u683c\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3002 ", "note_en": "If you&#39;re looking to learn C, or you&#39;ve ever wondered how to build your own programming language, this is the book for you.\n In just a few lines of code, I&#39;ll teach you how to use C, and together, we&#39;ll start building your very own language.\n Along the way we&#39;ll learn about the weird and wonderful nature of Lisps, how to develop a real-world project, concisely solve problems, and write beautiful code!\n This book is free to read online, so you can get started right away!

", "note_en": "On the Clock is Motherboard&#39;s reporting on the organized labor movement, gig work, automation, and the future of work.\n  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country&#39;s largest and most powerful unions, has said in an official resolution obtained by Motherboard that unionizing and building worker power at Amazon is the top priority moving forward. The announcement comes on  Prime Day, one of Amazon&#39;s busiest days of the year.\n    &#34;The Teamsters will build the types of worker and community power necessary to take on one of the most powerful corporations in the world and win,&#34; said Randy Korgan, the Teamster&#39;s National Amazon Director, in a 26-minute video on &#34;the Amazon Project&#34; obtained by Motherboard, that will be played at the Teamsters convention on Tuesday.\n  At their virtual convention on Tuesday, Teamster delegates from roughly 500 local Teamsters unions will also receive a copy of the resolution, which will receive a vote on Thursday, and is expected to pass resoundingly.\n  The resolution states the Teamsters plan to create a special Amazon Division, specifically to aid Amazon workers in unionizing and defending standards in the logistics industry\u2014and will fully fund the project.\n  If implemented, the project will be the most ambitious and focused endeavor so far in the United States to organize the fiercely anti-union retail behemoth. Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has kept unions out of its workforce and is on track to become the country&#39;s largest employer  within the next year or two. The Teamsters have 1.4 million members in the United States and Canada.\n  &#34;We&#39;ve been working on this for quite some time\u2014well before Bessemer broke out,&#34; Randy Korgan, Teamsters National Director for Amazon, told Motherboard, referring to the unionization drive in Bessemer, Alabama that Amazon thwarted earlier this year.\n   Since 2016, various departments within the Teamsters have been tracking Amazon&#39;s growth and impact and speaking to thousands of workers to develop the best strategies for organizing Amazon workers, according to the resolution. At the convention, the Teamsters will declare a sharper, unified approach across the Teamsters International, 500 local unions and dozens of joint councils.\n      The Teamsters\u2014which represents workers across the logistics industry, including warehousing, package delivery, freight, airline, and food distribution\u2014sees itself as a natural fit for organizing Amazon. &#34;We have an intrinsic knowledge in the industry,&#34; Korgan said. &#34;We understand transportation and logistics companies that are only motivated by profit will make changes that always end in workers losing. There\u2019s been one unified organization for those workers and that\u2019s been Teamsters members and the Teamsters union as a whole.&#34;\n Do you have a tip to share with us about Amazon? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Please get in touch with Lauren, the reporter, via email Lauren.gurley@vice.com or securely on Signal (201)-897-2109.\n  Earlier this year, following an  intense union-busting campaign led by Amazon management and hired consultants, Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama  voted against unionizing in a landslide defeat for the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which ignited a wave of interest among Amazon workers from New York City to Iowa City in forming unions and having a say in their wages, workplace safety protections, productivity requirements, and rest time.\n  With the Amazon Project, the Teamsters are taking a different approach that doesn&#39;t rely on the traditional National Labor Relations Board election process that allows employers to run sophisticated anti-union campaigns and involves the task of running elections warehouse by warehouse.\n    Instead the Teamsters plan to focus on a series of pressure campaigns involving work stoppages, petitions, and other collective action to push Amazon to recognize a union and bargain over working conditions. This  tactic mirrors how the Teamsters organized its first members, horse drivers, grave haulers, and beer wagon drivers, who did not have union rights in the early twentieth century, using shop floor strikes, city-wide strikes, and other mass collective action in the streets.\n  &#34;We could have been the first Bessemer, but we chose not to go down the path of an NLRB election for the reasons that were validated in the Bessemer union election,&#34; Korgan said. &#34;At the same time, the Bessemer workers&#39; message was heard by millions of workers in their position who realized, &#39;Oh there&#39;s something I can do about this.\u2019 The list is very long in how workers can seek justice on the job. The NLRB is not the only way.&#34;\n  The Teamsters hold a convention every five years where delegates across the United States and Canada vote to set a new agenda for the union. This year&#39;s convention will focus on the Amazon Project. The project has six main components, according to the convention video obtained by Motherboard\u2014educating and engaging its current union members, organizing Amazon workers, engaging the public, antitrust enforcement, industry pressure, and global solidarity.\n    The Teamsters would not go into detail about the funding or timeline for the Amazon Project, but said Teamster International, local unions, and dozens of regional joint councils have &#34;committed tremendous resources to this.&#34; Around the country, members are already participating in volunteer organizing training and education sessions related to the Amazon Project, and will continue to do so in the coming years. These trainings focus on how Amazon degrades pay and working conditions across the logistics industry, the history of worker struggles that led to the formation of Teamsters, and how Teamsters members can organize and engage Amazon workers.\n  This volunteer organizing program, which was developed by Korgan in Southern California and is the model for the Amazon Project&#39;s worker education program, is based on the premise that Amazon workers often belong to the same communities, families, and neighborhoods as Teamsters union members\u2014and should leverage those connections to organize Amazon.\n   &#34;I have a son who worked at Amazon and a cousin who works at Amazon. I really see Amazon how they&#39;re in a position where your hands are tied and you have management not treating you fairly and you\u2019re not getting your fair share of the pie,&#34; said Donnell Jefferson, a forklift operator at TForce Logistics in Memphis, Tennessee and a Teamsters union member.\n  Jefferson helped unionize his worksite in 2008 and got a $4 raise. He now makes $29.08 an hour and says his treatment from managers improved with a union contract. He joined the volunteer program to help other workers organize.\n    &#34;My young cousin [who works at Amazon] always calls me asking for a loan,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t mind but she shouldn\u2019t be in a position where she has to live with her mom and borrow money. They ought to be able to get better wages and healthcare and take care of their family. I struggled before I unionized but it&#39;s changed my life.&#34;\n  &#34;I do volunteer organizing because I feel Amazon workers should have what I have,&#34; said Robert Martinez, a UPS driver and member of Teamsters Local 63 in Ontario, California who participates in the volunteer organizing program. Martinez, who is 42 years old, earns $39.23 an hour as a yard shifter, and receives a pension and healthcare benefits.\n  &#34;I\u2019m here to educate workers on their right to organize to stand up to employers,&#34; he continued. &#34;I have talked to Amazon drivers when I run into them. They&#39;re overworked and are not employees of Amazon. One day when I&#39;m out there on a street I hope I am able to greet an Amazon driver and know he\u2019s in a union and he\u2019s getting paid like he should be.&#34;\n  As a point of comparison, Amazon delivery drivers in Southern California earn $15 or $16 an hour. As Motherboard has previously reported, Amazon  frequently touts its $15 an hour minimum wage, while  positioning itself against Walmart and other retail jobs, where workers are typically paid much less.\u00a0 But in reality, Amazon is  driving down wages in the warehouse and delivery industries.\n    Even with the benefits and protections of a union, Teamsters members, particularly at UPS and other logistics companies, say they&#39;ve seen their working conditions deteriorate as Amazon has expanded its reach in the parcel delivery sector.\n  They cite higher delivery quotas, more weekend and holiday shifts, unpredictable schedules, and a greater reliance on temps and contractors. Motivated by improving these worsening conditions, UPS and other unionized logistics workers are joining the effort to organize Amazon workers.\n  &#34;Quotas are going up. Astronomical figures. We&#39;ve seen a massive increase in Amazon packages,&#34; Anthony Rosario, a UPS driver in Brooklyn and a shop steward at Teamsters Local 804 who has been in the union for 27 years, told Motherboard. &#34;Industry standards are being diminished that we fought for for decades. They&#39;re forcing people to work holidays and weekends. [UPS] is bending to Amazon&#39;s competition.&#34;\n   Unlike the Bessemer union drive, which went public a few months into the campaign, the Teamsters are keeping much of their internal strategy under wraps in order to avoid Amazon&#39;s union busting campaigns.\n  Still, the Teamsters has been publicly engaging in a  community pressure campaign in California&#39;s Inland Empire, where Amazon is the largest private employer and has at least 14 Amazon fulfillment centers, to implement a community benefits agreement that would mandate that a new Amazon Air Regional AirHub pay prevailing wages and agree to a zero-emissions plan. Earlier this year,  USA Today reported that the union has been organizing hundreds of delivery drivers at two warehouses in Iowa.\n  &#34;Every region must understand the systems that are at play,&#34; said Korgan in the video that will be shown at the convention on Tuesday. &#34;If [Amazon] workers are organizing independently, the Teamsters will help. If workers are not organizing, Teamsters will get it started.

Realizing how much of their present and future business depends on folks wanting to use their services, they work hard to protect data and privacy. (Like I said, more or less!) After all, our data is what they use to bundle and sell as services to their  real customers: advertisers. In the case of Apple, the new marketing pitch is all about \u201cprivacy\u201d and how they are not collecting tracking data \u2014 a handy way to distinguish themselves from Google and Facebook. I buy Apple products precisely for their stance towards privacy, at least in the U.S. In short, a noble ideology that also helps them sell more gear with fat margins\u2014not that there\u2019s anything wrong with it.\n The companies we should be worried about are the many smaller and mid-sized companies that most of us have never heard about. Whether it is app developers surreptitiously selling information to third parties, data breaches at retailers (and their digital platforms), or data-brokers with security systems that have more holes than swiss cheese, these companies will continue to be the cause of most headaches in our digital lives. And they are the group more likely to take liberties with data and privacy.\n I began ruminating on this earlier in the week when I read  this article about electric utilities  resetting the smart thermostats inside residential homes in Houston in response to the rising demand for electricity due to record-breaking heat. This story is a harbinger of our future: what at first seems like some minor convenience and even a seemingly good deal becomes a major problem for those who don\u2019t spend time reading the complicated terms of service documents \u2014 which is to say, just about everyone.\n In this case, if a customer signed up for an offering called \u201cSmart Savers Texas\u201d from a company called EnergyHub (which is owned by Alarm.com, a seller of security services), they could be entered into sweepstakes. In exchange, they gave permission to EnergyHub to control their thermostats during periods of peak or extreme demand.\n This is yet another example of how, though we dread the future controlled by big technology companies, we will ultimately suffer most at the hands of what I call \u201cnon-technology\u201d companies that now have access to our private data and control over our lives.\n And at the top of the list are companies that have always been hostile to their customers: telephone companies, electric utilities, insurance companies, for-profit hospital systems, big airlines, and other such organizations. They will only use \u201csmart data\u201d to amplify their past bad behavior.\n Dark patterns around offers like \u201cSmart Savers Texas\u201d make it virtually impossible for you and me to really discern what we might be signing up for. After all, no one sifts through the pages-long terms of service agreements. And I certainly don\u2019t mean to pick on this one company \u2014 this \u201cunclear\u201d behavior is part of the entire digital ecosystem.\n Try getting out from under a contract at a health club or canceling your subscription to  The New York Times. Good luck. In this digital age, these seemingly simple tasks have only gotten harder. I have been trying, without much success, to unsubscribe from emails from a publishing company for almost a decade. And this is neither the first nor the last time you are going to see \u201cutilities\u201d or other entities muck around with what you assume to be private spaces.\n What happened in Houston is among a rapidly growing list of incidents that make me pause about embracing the Smart Home, even though I was an early adopter. The safety of our \u201cconnected devices\u201d is increasingly unclear. I have little trust in Amazon\u2019s ability to police its digital shelves. What if the device we are buying is fake or is sending data surreptitiously to an overseas destination? I don\u2019t know if you remember (or even read) this scary  story in  Vice about seemingly innocuous apps that collect personal data and sell it to anyone willing to pay. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. It is increasingly important to pause and consider: is cheap really cheap, or is there a bigger price to pay in the long term?\n Belatedly, and thankfully, Apple has introduced  AppTrackingTransparency (ATT), which will force apps to seek permission to track us and our activity across apps. Deservedly, many have written about the impact of this on Facebook, but it goes beyond that one company. Still,  as EFF points out, it doesn\u2019t do enough.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anything about \u2018first-party\u2019 tracking, or an app tracking your behavior on that app itself,\u201d  EFF writes on its blog. \u201cATT might also be prone to \u2018notification fatigue\u2019 if users become so accustomed to seeing it that they just click through it without considering the choice. And, just like any other tracker-blocking initiative, ATT may set off a new round in the  cat-and-mouse game between trackers and those who wish to limit them.\u201d\n And that\u2019s the challenge. The pressure of protecting our digital sanctity is falling on consumers, not those who profit from it.

", "note_en": "A Belgian weightlifter says dealing with transgender issues in sport is &#34;impossible&#34; but the presence of Laurel Hubbard in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic games is &#34;like a bad joke&#34; to women athletes.\n  She is the first openly transgender athlete to qualify for the Olympic Games in any sport.\n Until now, none of Hubbard&#39;s rivals has spoken on the controversial rules that appear to give the New Zealander a huge and, to many, unfair advantage.\n Athletes from the United States and Britain are potentially adversely affected but, understandably, they and their National Federations have shown no desire to comment on the controversy.\n Anna Vanbellinghen of Belgium has broken the athletes&#39; silence with a considered statement on Hubbard\u2019s achievement.\n Vanbellinghen has a chance of qualifying in the same weight category, the over-87-kilogram super-heavyweights, and is therefore directly affected by the presence of Hubbard, who transitioned to female at the age of 35.\n Others have voiced outrage at Hubbard\u2019s presence in women\u2019s sport, most often on social media, but Vanbellinghen is not making a personal criticism.\n &#34;First off, I would like to stress that I fully support the transgender community, and that what I\u2019m about to say doesn\u2019t come from a place of rejection of this athlete\u2019s identity,&#34; Vanbellinghen said.\n  &#34;I am aware that defining a legal frame for transgender participation in sports is very difficult since there is an infinite variety of situations, and that reaching an entirely satisfactory solution, from either side of the debate, is probably impossible.\n &#34;However, anyone that has trained weightlifting at a high level knows this to be true in their bones: this particular situation is unfair to the sport and to the athletes.&#34;\n Vanbellinghen, 27, whose qualifying efforts were disrupted by injury, pointed out that the retained benefit of taking steroids, even years earlier, is widely known.\n &#34;So why is it still a question whether two decades, from puberty to the age of 35, with the hormonal system of a man also would give an advantage [in competing against women]?\n &#34;I understand that for sports authorities nothing is as simple as following your common sense, and that there are a lot of impracticalities when studying such a rare phenomenon, but for athletes the whole thing feels like a bad joke.\n &#34;Life-changing opportunities are missed for some athletes - medals and Olympic qualifications - and we are powerless.\n &#34;Of course, this debate is taking place in a broader context of discrimination against transgender people, and that is why the question is never free of ideology.\n &#34;However, the extreme nature of this particular situation really demonstrates the need to set up a stricter legal framework for transgender inclusion in sports, and especially elite sports.\n &#34;Because I do believe that everyone should have access to sports, but not at the expense of others.&#34;\n  A similar point was made by Jerry Wallwork, President of the Samoan Weightlifting Federation, which has had athletes competing against Hubbard since she transitioned in 2017.\n &#34;I was one of the people who opposed it [having Hubbard in Olympic qualifying] greatly back in 2018,&#34; Wallwork said.\n 2But I do feel that we cannot keep throwing mud at Laurel and blaming her, even though our female athletes are in direct competition with her and could miss out on competing at the Olympic Games.\n \u201cThe decision came from the top [an International Olympic Committee (IOC) sub committee] which approved participation of transgender athletes in women\u2019s weightlifting.\n  &#34;More research should go into this issue, or a separate category must be established for transgender lifters.\n &#34;Especially in contact sports and power sports like weightlifting, there is a disadvantage for female athletes against transgender athletes.&#34;\n Mark House, an American lawyer and International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) technical official, offers an in-depth analysis of the situation, and the advantage Hubbard has over her fellow competitors, in the latest  insidethegames\u00a0 Big Read.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 09:11:48",

You have a boundary marked by stones, but no documents to back it. That&#39;s how much of rural India lives.\n What if this could be changed? Not with a herculean human effort which involves thousands of workers traversing the length and breadth of the country, but with the help of a few thousand drones.\n  The acronym, which stands for \u201cSurvey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas\u201d is surveying the  abadi or inhabited areas of villages using drone technology. The idea is if villagers have a \u201crecord of rights\u201d to their households, they can use it as an asset and also fight off property disputes.\n If the project succeeds, boundaries currently defined by a tree or a stone, will stand transformed into something more tangible \u2014 a record on paper. And village topographies, like the one below, may finally be defined by clearer ownership confines.\n   The idea for the scheme came from Maharashtra, where the panchayat levies and collects property tax from  abadi areas, Alok Prem Nagar, joint secretary at the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, said. The state was looking to update its property register and got in touch with the Survey of India for help with the drone survey.\n Seeing what was being attempted in the state, it was realised a similar nationwide exercise could prove useful.\n With no clear demarcations, it\u2019s chaotic for someone to assert ownership, Nagar said, adding informal rights could be crystallised into a \u201crecord of rights\u201d, should the exercise work. Besides, substantial revenue could be collected and this could help fund the village panchayats, he said.\n \u201cImagine that you have informal ownership of your home but no documents to show ownership,\u201d Vinay Kumar Singh, economist and management consultant, said. \u201cIf someone asks, at best you could explain that your parents or your grandparents lived in the house and a part of it has been left to you. That is the reality in inhabited areas in villages in India. Someone could throw you out of your house and there may not be much you can do about it.\u201d\n \u201cThese areas have not been surveyed since independence and, if nothing else, laying down proper ownership boundaries can bring peace of mind for those who live in these areas,\u201d he said.\n Nagar and his team went on to study the idea and in April 2020 a pilot project was launched under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in collaboration with state Panchayati Raj departments, state revenue departments and the Survey of India as technology partner.\n The pilot operated in nine states\u2014Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh\u2014according to a statement by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.\n In April this year, it was rolled out for implementation across the country and is expected to cover about 6.62 lakh villages by 2024.\n Hundreds of drone flights have already taken place, just like the one below,  collecting aerial images across the country, ranging from the foothills of the Himalayas to the deserts of Rajasthan.\n  The process isn\u2019t quite as easy as it sounds. Naturally, there are questions, concerns and, perhaps even a degree of suspicion. So the first step is to create awareness among villagers, said Singh. Then, lime stone powder or \u201cchuna\u201d is used to mark boundaries, with workers from the gram panchayat and revenue department overseeing the work.\n It is a fascinating exercise, where the governments organise a \u201cnukad natak\u201d (neighbourhood play), collect people in one place and explain to them the purpose of the chuna marking and the drone surveys.\n  Once this process of informal boundary marking is done, the drones take flight to collect high resolution images.\n With the kind of utilisation of drones taking place, the kind of variable terrains and the impact that the drones deliver, this can be called the most impactful application of drones anywhere in the world even in it\u2019s current phase, said Vipul Singh, co-founder and CEO at AUS, a company that delivers drone solutions to Svamitva.\n  For instance, in Uttarakhand, a drone can cover three to four villages per day on average, while it can cover five to seven villages in Uttar Pradesh, Singh said.\n The images are then sent for processing to the Survey of India and finally take the shape of maps.\n Once the maps are ready, villagers are given about 15 days to verify that their land is mapped properly, after which they receive their property cards.\n So far, drone surveys have been completed for nearly 46,000 villages according to Nagar. Property cards have been distributed in more than 7,489 villages across more than 7.09 lakh beneficiaries, according to a press release by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj dated May 4, 2021.\n For instance, when \u201cchuna\u201d marking is left undone or is done incorrectly, data has to be recollected.\n There is also a back-log in processing data, said Vishal Saxena, vice president of surveillance and mapping at IdeaForge, a drone manufacturing company that supplies to the scheme.\n The Survey of India isn\u2019t able to process data quickly enough for a host of reasons, Saxena said. For the Survey of India to put in place the IT infrastructure needed to manage data of this magnitude will take time, he said.\n An inadequate number of drones is another problem, as is the focus on picking the lowest bidders rather than the best technology.\n According to people in the industry, an emergency procurement mandate has been passed for a foreign vendor without a tender and the price of procurement is at about 40% over than previous tenders.\n  At the current pace and with the disruption to work because of the pandemic, the project is likely to overshoot its timeline, Vipul Singh of AUS said.\n  Beyond the logistical challenges and the experiment with drone technology, can the project achieve what it set out to do?\n In villages where we have completed work, the project is already achieving its objectives, said Nagar. Along with its intended objectives such as ease of bank loans and reducing property disputes, there are other positive externalities. For instance, people now understand the issue of compensation in land acquisition better, he said.\n  \u201cEvery state will have to enact laws that ascertain the legality of the property cards being issued,\u201d Nagar said. \u201cAnd then states will need to engage with lenders and others to ensure acceptance of these property cards as collateral.\u201d\n While the end goal of the project of the project may be some distance away, the learnings from the process could prove to be valuable in themselves.\n Once you have the ecosystem of drones in place and once you have the expertise available where you can interpret the drone photographs and create maps, then you can map and survey anything... The expertise is now available with the state governments and they can do whatever they wish to. For instance, nothing stops a certain state government from doing the same exercise for the farming land also.\n \u201cWith the scheme underway and with the geospatial policy opening up, this technology can be used for anti-poaching by the forest department or electricity tower inspections, for instance,\u201d Saxena said.

Click through for details!\n   We\u2019re just about through our inaugural season of The Downtime Project podcast, and to celebrate, we\u2019re reflecting back on recurring themes we\u2019ve noticed in many of the ten outages we\u2019ve poured over. It\u2019s been remarkable how consistent certain patterns have been\u2013either as risks or as assets\u2013to the engineering teams as they\u2019ve tackled these incidents.\n Out of these recurring patterns we\u2019ve extracted lessons that we intend to take into our own engineering teams; and so, we\u2019ve compiled five of those lessons below for the benefit of any interested readers, with the hope that you, too, will find them useful to learn from and to prepare for. As we go, we\u2019ll include links to the outages and episodes where each theme occurred.\n If you feel like we\u2019ve missed any major patterns, or have any other feedback for us, please leave a comment. And thank you all for listening to the first season of The Downtime Project.\n  The instinct to \u201cdogfood\u201d is a great one\u2013after all, how can you reasonably expect your customers to use your products and services if you will not? How can you endorse the workflow they enable if you don\u2019t stake your own company\u2019s productivity on it?\n However, this healthy instinct backfires when said dogfooding creates a dependency cycle wherein you rely on your own systems\u2026 to fix your systems.\n Other instances of this dependency pattern fall out of the otherwise-virtuous motto:  don\u2019t repeat yourself. Why run another kind of database just for monitoring? You already run a production database very well, thank you very much. So just put the telemetry data in there, too.\n These cycles, too, can hurt badly during outages. Like, authentication needing to be working to access operational systems to fix authentication\u2026 or monitoring needing working databases to get to metric data to discover what\u2019s wrong the the databases. Fun stuff like that.\n Even customer communication systems are sometimes broken because you use your own system to relay system status to your customers.\n  Ep 1. Slack vs TGWs: Slack couldn\u2019t access dashboards to know what was wrong with their systems because AWS Transit Gateways needed to be healthy in order to get http traffic to their dashboards. Unfortunately, the TGW were what was unhealthy.\n Ep 3. Monzo\u2019s 2019 Cassandra Outage: Monzo\u2019s production database was down, which was necessary to authenticate system access and deploy code to fix the issue.\n Ep 10. Kinesis Hits the Thread Limit: AWS couldn\u2019t update their status page about their Kinesis-related outage because updates to the status page depended on Kinesis.\n Ep 11. Salesforce Publishes a Controversial Postmortem: Salesforce couldn\u2019t update their status page because they hosted it on a Heroku-based service, and since they owned Heroku and had therefore integrated it into their infrastructure, Heroku\u2019s uptime depended on their system health\n  Everyone is super excited about the modern public cloud and its myriad APIs. The elasticity! The orchestration! Automating away operations so humans don\u2019t have to get woken up!\n But this zeal sometimes has us over-automate systems where it is very difficult to test the degenerate cases. And, the downside of those untested degenerate cases may be much more significant than the slight efficiency or economic upside of having this be an automatic decision during healthier system states.\n But even if the automation  is sensible because the adjustment needs to happen often and/or the economics involved are substantial, the automation sometimes lacks a necessary \u201cpanic mode\u201d, recognizing when parameters have swung way outside their normal range. In these cases the automation should stop automating and page the operators, because it\u2019s about to start making some wildly illogical decisions.\n  Ep 1. Slack vs TGWs: Slack\u2019s automation threw away a bunch of servers they \u201cdidn\u2019t need\u201d (narrator: they did) due to idle CPU during a network issue, then spun up far too many when the surge of traffic returned, causing file descriptor limits to be exceeded on their systems.\n Ep 6. GitHub\u2019s 43 Second Network Partition: GitHub\u2019s database automation did a cross-country promotion of a primary with incomplete records during a 43 second network partition.\n Ep 8. Auth0\u2019s Seriously Congested Database: Auth0 spun up twice as many frontends when requests slowed down due to the database, just exacerbating issues with even more traffic.\n  If only everything were stateless, eh? Those pesky databases are always causing us problems. Even the issues that manifested themselves in frontend layers were often congestion that cascaded upward from databases slowing down deeper in the service stack.\n This area was so rife for material that we\u2019ve broken out three sub-lessons:\n  Production systems are happy with flat, uniform loads with low variance. When it comes to database servers, that means lots of very fast queries, probably all index-backed, where the worst-case cost is bound.\n To ensure this, put your arbitrary batch queries in a dedicated secondary server, or in some OLAP system like BigQuery or Snowflake. Or, heck, dump to CSV and parallel grep. Whatever level of sophistication makes you happy and fits your dataset size and workflow.\n And if you don\u2019t yet know enough about your query time distribution to know whether you have crazy table scans at the end your tails, stop reading this and go add that monitoring right now!\n  Ep 2. Gitlab\u2019s 2017 Postgres Outage: Very expensive long-running account deletion operations ran live on their production database, leading to congestion and failure.\n Ep 5. Auth0 Silently Loses Some Indexes: Unmonitored failures to create an index caused some queries to suddenly become scans greatly increasing load on database and eventually causing outage.\n Ep 8. Auth0\u2019s Seriously Congested Database: Database issues were exacerbated by some ad-hoc expensive scans that were happening on production systems.\n   Low magic (good): Use something boring like MySQL and deal with sharding yourself. This will suck because you have to do a lot of extra work in the application layer, but you will probably know how it works when it breaks. This was probably the right idea 10 years ago, but is still fine.\n Lowest magic (gooder): Just buy a bigger server and use one unsharded MySQL/PostgreSQL server with a replica or two. This good idea is evergreen\u2013ride this as long as you can.\n High magic (admittedly, probably best in 2021+): Pay a cloud provider to run your database for you, including all your backups and failover, etc. You can even use a fancy database if you\u2019d really like, like CloudSpanner, or DynamoDB, or whatever. This used to be unthinkable due the complete, opaque reliance on a 3rd party, but it is likely the best idea in 2021. These big companies have gotten very good at this stuff, and you\u2019re probably already existentially doomed if they don\u2019t do their job well since you\u2019re running your company on one of them anyway. The downside is that it\u2019s gonna cost you, because the markup on these services is high.\n Middle Magic (playing with fire): Use something that will claim to automatically solve all your scaling and failover problems, but  you still have to operate, and it has a lot less production miles on it than something boring like MySQL. When it goes wrong, very few people know how to operate or understand its internals well enough to diagnose the sophisticated failure modes of its orchestration flows. The probable suspects we encountered in these outages include MongoDB and Cassandra.\n  Ep 3. Monzo\u2019s 2019 Cassandra Outage: Expanding Cassandra cluster had lots of poorly-understood configuration foot guns.\n Ep 5. Auth0 Silently Loses Some Indexes: The balance of resyncing replicas in mongo without degrading live traffic was very difficult to achieve.\n  Backing up means  nothing if you cannot prove you can restore it, and the restoration produces the correct records, and that restoration will complete before the heat death of the universe.\n  Backup didn\u2019t run\u2026 that would never happen, I\u2019m monitoring that!\n Backup ran and produced a file in S3. This might be as far as your backup validation goes. The file is empty. Or it contains the helpful string:  Error: permission denied on directory /data. Your company is gone, while you scream \u201cbut you exited zero!!!\u201d into the night.\n Backup ostensibly contains lots of great data, but got corrupted on upload. Your company is gone.\n Backup contains a valid database! But every shard is shard 0 because of a loop bug in your backup script. 87.5% of your company is gone.\n Every backup contains the correct, valid database! But downloading it from that cheap storage class over a 85ms link will mean restoring will take 2 weeks. Your company is  still gone.\n So, make sure you prove your restores work\u2013automate and monitor this, don\u2019t just do it once in awhile\u2013and make sure they will restore in an acceptable amount of time. Expect it to be a bad day, like 4 hours, but not company ending, like 4 days. Make sure corporate-policy-wise your company is comfortable with this restoration time, and get sign-off from your leadership so they won\u2019t be surprised when the engineering team needs 7 hours to get the databases back during a catastrophe.\n  Ep 2. Gitlab\u2019s 2017 Postgres Outage: Backup script had been running daily, putting things to S3\u2026 until a software update broke the backup script. Restorations hadn\u2019t really ever been tested.\n Ep 6. GitHub\u2019s 43 Second Network Partition: Restores took a very long time (10h+), especially during peak traffic, leading to a very long time the site was degraded.\n  Despite our best efforts, mistakes will still happen. We\u2019ll introduce bugs, or misconfigure stuff, or propagate a bad firewall rule, or whatever.\n However, staged rollouts localize the issue so you can see the smoke before the fire spreads and burns down your entire site.\n A lot of teams we discussed had a thoughful rollout methodology that made sure their company\u2019s employees were among the first users to be trying out changes to their services, and then only a small fraction of their customers would be exposed before all were.\n  Roll out to your  Dogfooding cluster \u2014 every hour, or every single change set, the current HEAD version is deployed to your employees. This lets your own team catch issues far before your customers ever see it.\n Canary cluster \u2014 at your release cadence (once a day, perhaps?), the release candidate is pushed out to a small deployment that exposes it to a small percentage of your users. Some companies make this one datacenter among dozens; others make this some percentage of the userbase, based on a modulus of their user_id or similar. A release manager may carefully monitor the metrics on this new release in the canary population, before moving on to\u2026\n Production. Now it starts to go out to the wider world. Depending on the criticality of the service and the release cadence, sometimes all at once, or sometimes  further staggered, like a datacenter at a time.\n For companies who employed these approaches, certainly there were many occasions when most of us never knew about a small issue because it was caught in dogfooding, or canary, or what-have-you.\n But in instances in our podcasts where the companies had not utilized a staged rollout, things went markedly less well\u2026 and the teams writing the postmortems were the first to call out how much a staged deployment would have made a difference.\n  Ep. 4 One Subtle Regex Takes Down Cloudflare: Cloudflare\u2019s very rapid deployment of a more expensive regular expression-based rule took the entire site down due to CPU exhaustion\n Ep 11. Salesforce Publishes a Controversial Postmortem: Rapid deployment of a DNS configuration change took all their name servers offline\n  Finally, while we\u2019d all love to believe that if we\u2019re very thorough on testing, and if we stage things thoughtfully, we won\u2019t have any more full outages\u2026 we all know they\u2019re still going to happen.\n So, as we learned from many of our outages, if we build in policies and knobs into our systems and playbooks ahead of outages, we\u2019ll have a much easier time recovering from them.\n Policies means having thought through and decided things like: if the whole site goes down from excess load, which traffic do we shed first to recover? What types, or what classes of customers? If these decisions are made ahead of time, and signed off by leadership, potentially even validated with lawyers, the engineering teams will have a lot easier time getting things back under duress.\n Knobs means: do we have something like a \u201cpanic mode\u201d we can set, where orchestration stops, load balancers get less clever, and nonessential jobs are automatically paused? Do we have a runtime parameter we can tweak to shed some fractional percentage of our load, so that we don\u2019t have to just turn off and on everything, thereby encouraging the thundering herd?\n  Ep 1. Slack vs TGWs: Slack was able to use the envoy proxy\u2019s panic mode to maximize the chance the load balancing algorithm found a healthy host while overloaded.\n Ep. 4 One Subtle Regex Takes Down Cloudflare: Cloudflare already had policies and supporting terms-of-use that allowed them to turn off their global Web Application Firewall when that service was failing. Additionally, they had a runtime parameters that allowed them to disable this instantly without deploying code.\n Ep 6. GitHub\u2019s 43 Second Network Partition: GitHub turned off web hook invocations and GitHub Pages builds while it was recovering from overload.\n Ep 9. How Coinbase Unleashed a Thundering Herd: Coinbase needed to overprovision one of its clusters to deal with thundering herd after flipping all traffic off/on rather than just slowly ramping traffic back up.\n  After reviewing all these stressful outages, we feel confident in one very encouraging conclusion: a few common practices, many that we\u2019ve enumerated above, will either prevent or dramatically lessen the severity of all manner of resultant site issues.\n Thanks again to all Downtime Project listeners out there for your feedback, advocacy, and support! We\u2019re considering these ten outages a wrap on season one, and we\u2019ll regroup, reflect, and be back with more episodes in season two shortly!", "posttime": "2021-06-23 08:27:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e2d\u65ad,ten,\u6570\u636e\u5e93", "title": "\u5341\u4e2a\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u4e03\u8282\u8bfe ", "title_en": "Seven Lessons from Ten Outages", "transed": 1, "url": "https://downtimeproject.com/podcast/7-lessons-from-10-outages/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e2d\u65ad", "ten", "\u6570\u636e\u5e93"]}]
