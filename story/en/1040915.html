Earlier in the week, Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, floated the idea (which he had  promoted before) that the president impose martial law and deploy the military to “rerun” the election in several closely contested states that voted against Trump. It appears that Flynn wants to turn them into literal battleground states.</p><p>  似乎还不够，我们还了解到，前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林在承认对联邦调查局撒谎后被总统赦免，他参加了星期五的会议。在本周早些时候，已退休的中将弗林（Flynn）提出了一个想法（他以前曾提倡过），即总统实施戒严令并部署军队在几个投票反对特朗普的竞争激烈的州“重新进行”选举。似乎弗林想把他们变成真正的战场状态。</p><p>  None of this should come as a surprise. Some of us  said, even before he became president, that Donald Trump’s Rosetta Stone, the key to deciphering him, was his psychology—his disordered personality, his emotional and mental instability, and his sociopathic tendencies. It was the main reason, though hardly the only reason, I refused to vote for him in 2016 or in 2020, despite having worked in the three previous Republican administrations. Nothing that Trump has done over the past four years has caused me to rethink my assessment, and a great deal has happened to confirm it.</p><p>  这些都不应该让人感到意外。我们中有些人说，即使在成为总统之前，唐纳德特朗普的罗塞塔石碑，关键要破译他的，是他的心理，他那一头凌乱的个性，他的情绪和精神状态不稳定，和他的反社会倾向。这是主要原因，尽管不是唯一原因，但尽管我曾在前三届共和党政府任职，但我拒绝在2016年或2020年投票支持他。特朗普在过去四年中所做的任何事情都没有使我重新考虑我的评估，并且发生了很多事情来证实这一点。</p><p>  Given Trump’s psychological profile, it was inevitable that when he felt the walls of reality close in on him—in 2020, it was the pandemic, the cratering economy, and his election defeat—he would detach himself even further from reality. It was predictable that the president would assert even more bizarre conspiracy theories. That he would become more enraged and embittered, more desperate and despondent, more consumed by his grievances. That he would go against past supplicants, like Attorney General Bill Barr and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, and become more aggressive toward his perceived enemies. That his wits would begin to turn, in the words of King Lear. That he would begin to lose his mind.</p><p>  考虑到特朗普的心理状况，不可避免的是，当他感觉到现实的墙在他身边的时候— 2020年，是大流行，经济崩溃和他的大选失败，他将使自己与现实进一步分离。可以预见，总统会断言更奇怪的阴谋论。他会变得更加愤怒和沮丧，更加绝望和沮丧，更加被他的委屈所消耗。他将与总检察长比尔·巴尔和佐治亚州州长布莱恩·坎普等过往的恳求者抗衡，并对他的敌人更加激进。用李尔王的话说，他的智慧将开始转向。他将开始失去理智。</p><p>  So he has. And, as a result, President Trump has become even more destabilizing and dangerous.</p><p>  所以他有。结果，特朗普总统变得更加不稳定和危险。</p><p> “I’ve been covering Donald Trump for a while,” Jonathan Swan of  Axios  tweeted. “I can’t recall hearing more intense concern from senior officials who are actually Trump people. The Sidney Powell/Michael Flynn ideas are finding an enthusiastic audience at the top.”</p><p> “我一直在报道唐纳德·特朗普，” Axios的乔纳森·斯旺（Jonathan Swan）发推文说。 “我不记得听到实际上是特朗普人民的高级官员的强烈关注。悉尼·鲍威尔（Sidney Powell）/迈克尔·弗林（Michael Flynn）的想法正在顶部吸引了热情的听众。”</p><p>  Even amid the chaos, it’s worth taking a step back to think about where we are: An American president, unwilling to concede his defeat by 7 million popular votes and 74 Electoral College votes, is  still trying to steal the election. It has become his obsession.</p><p>  即使在混乱中，也值得退后一步来思考我们的位置：一位美国总统不愿以700万张民意票和74张选举团的票数认输，仍在试图窃取选举。这已成为他的痴迷。 </p><p> In the process, Trump has in too many cases turned his party into an instrument of illiberalism and nihilism. Here are just a couple of data points to underscore that claim: 18 attorneys generals and more than half the Republicans in the House supported  a seditious abuse of the judicial process.</p><p>在此过程中，特朗普在太多情况下将其政党变成了自由主义和虚无主义的工具。以下是要强调的几个数据点：18位司法部长和众议院一半以上的共和党人支持煽动滥用司法程序。</p><p> And it’s not only, or even mainly, elected officials. The Republican Party’s base has often followed Trump into the twilight zone, with a sizable majority of them affirming that Joe Biden won the election based on fraud and many of them turning against medical science in the face of a surging pandemic.</p><p> 这不仅是民选官员，甚至主要是民选官员。共和党的基地之后往往特朗普进入模糊地带，具有相当大的多数的他们肯定了拜登赢得大选基于欺诈行为，其中许多人在涌动流行的脸转向对医学科学。</p><p> COVID-19 is now killing Americans at the rate of about one per minute, but the president is “just done with COVID,” a source identified as one of Trump’s closest advisers  told   The Washington Post. “I think he put it on a timetable and he’s done with COVID ... It just exceeded the amount of time he gave it.”</p><p> 特朗普最亲密的顾问之一告诉《华盛顿邮报》，消息人士称，COVID-19目前正在以每分钟约一分钟的速度杀死美国人，但总统“只是用COVID做完了”。 “我认为他把它放在了时间表上，他已经完成了COVID的工作……这刚刚超过了他给它的时间。”</p><p>  This is where Trump’s crippling psychological condition—his complete inability to face unpleasant facts, his toxic narcissism, and his utter lack of empathy—became lethal. Trump’s negligence turned what would have been a difficult winter into a dark one. If any of his predecessors—Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan, to go back just 40 years—had been president during this pandemic, tens of thousands of American lives would almost surely have been saved.</p><p>  在这里，特朗普严重的心理状况（他完全无法面对令人不快的事实，他的自恋和完全缺乏同情心）变得致命。特朗普的疏忽将原本艰难的冬天变成了一个黑暗的冬天。如果他的任何前任—巴拉克·奥巴马，乔治·W·布什，比尔·克林顿，乔治·HW·布什和罗纳德·里根，仅回溯到40岁，就曾在这一大流行时期担任过总统，那么几乎肯定会有成千上万的美国人过着这种生活已保存。</p><p> “My concern was, in the worst part of the battle, the general was missing in action,”  said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, one of the very few Republicans to speak truth in the Trump era.</p><p> 马里兰州州长拉里·霍根说：“我担心的是，在战斗的最糟糕的时刻，将军在行动中失踪了。”他是特朗普时代讲真相的极少数共和党人之一。</p><p>  In 30 days, Donald Trump will leave the presidency, with his efforts to mount a coup having failed. The encouraging news is that it never really had a chance of succeeding. Our institutions, especially the courts, will have passed a stress test, not the most difficult ever but difficult enough, and unlike any in our history. Some local officials exhibited profiles in courage, doing the right thing in the face of threats and pressure from their party. And a preponderance of the American public, having lived through the past four years, deserve credit for canceling this presidential freak show rather than renewing it. The “ exhausted majority” wasn’t too exhausted to get out and vote, even in a pandemic.</p><p>  30天后，唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）将离开总统府，而他发动政变的努力失败了。令人鼓舞的消息是，它从未真正有过成功的机会。我们的机构，特别是法院，将通过压力测试，这不是有史以来最困难的事情，但是足够困难，而且与我们历史上的任何经历都不一样。一些地方官员表现出勇气，在面对党派的威胁和压力时做正确的事情。在过去的四年中生活的美国公众中，有很多人应该取消这次总统怪胎秀而不是更新它，这是值得赞扬的。即使在大流行中，“疲惫的多数”也不是很累，无法出去投票。</p><p>  But the Trump presidency will leave gaping wounds nearly everywhere, and ruination in some places. Truth as a concept has been battered from the highest office in the land on an almost hourly basis. The Republican Party has been radicalized, with countless Republican lawmakers and other prominent figures within the party having revealed themselves to be moral cowards, even, and in some ways especially,  after Trump was defeated. During the Trump presidency, they were so afraid of getting crosswise with him and his supporters that they failed the  Solzhenitsyn test: “The simple act of an ordinary brave man is not to participate in lies, not to support false actions! His rule: Let  that come into the world, let it even reign supreme—only not through me.”</p><p>  但是特朗普总统任期将在几乎所有地方留下巨大的伤口，并在某些地方造成破坏。真相作为一个概念已几乎每小时都在该国最高职位上遭受重创。共和党已经激化，无数共和党议员和党内其他知名人士甚至在特朗普被击败后，甚至在某些方面尤其显示出自己是道德moral夫。在特朗普担任总统期间，他们非常害怕与他和他的支持者相处，以致未能通过Solzhenitsyn测验：“一个普通勇敢的人的简单举动就是不撒谎，不支持虚假的举动！他的法则：让那东西进入世界，甚至让它统治至高无上-只是不要通过我。 </p><p> During the past four years, the right-wing ecosystem became more and more rabid. Many prominent evangelical supporters of the president are either obsequious, like  Franklin Graham, or delusional, like  Eric Metaxas, and they now peddle their delusions as being written by God. QAnon and the Proud Boys,  Newsmax and One America News, Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson—all have been emboldened.</p><p>在过去的四年中，右翼生态系统变得越来越狂热。总统的许多福音派拥护者要么像富兰克林·格雷厄姆那样过时，要么像埃里克·梅塔克萨斯那样妄想，现在他们兜售自己的妄想是上帝所写的。 QAnon和《骄傲男孩》，Newsmax和《美国新闻》，Alex Jones和Tucker Carlson都胆大包天。</p><p>  These worrisome trends began before Trump ran for office, and they won’t disappear after he leaves the presidency. Those who hope for a quick snapback will be disappointed. Still, having Trump out of office has to help. He’s going to find out that there’s no comparable bully pulpit. And the media, if they are wise, will cut off his oxygen, which is attention. They had no choice but to cover Trump’s provocations when he was president; when he’s an ex-president, that will change.</p><p>  这些令人担忧的趋势始于特朗普竞选公职之前，而这些趋势在他离开总统后不会消失。那些希望快速回弹的人会感到失望。尽管如此，让特朗普卸任还是有帮助的。他将发现没有可比的恶霸讲台。并且，如果媒体明智的话，它将切断他的氧气，这是引起注意的。他们别无选择，只能掩盖特朗普当总统时的挑衅行为。当他是前总统时，情况将会改变。</p><p> For the foreseeable future, journalists will rightly focus on the pandemic. But once that is contained and defeated, it will be time to go back to focusing more attention on things like the Paris Accords and the carbon tax; the earned-income tax credit and infrastructure; entitlement reform and monetary policy; charter schools and campus speech codes; legal immigration, asylum, assimilation, and social mobility. There is also an opportunity, with Trump a former president, for the Republican Party to once again become the home of sane conservatism. Whether that happens or not is an open question. But it’s something many of us are willing to work for, and that even progressives should hope for.</p><p> 在可预见的未来，记者将正确地关注流行病。但是，一旦遏制和制止了这一问题，就该回到将更多注意力集中在《巴黎协定》和碳税等问题上了。所得所得税抵免和基础设施；权利改革和货币政策；特许学校和校园语音守则；合法移民，庇护，同化和社会流动。与特朗普担任前总统一样，共和党还有机会再次成为理智的保守主义的家园。这是否发生是一个悬而未决的问题。但这是我们许多人愿意为之奋斗的东西，即使是进步主义者也应该希望。</p><p>  Beyond that, and more fundamental than that, we have to remind ourselves that we are not powerless to shape the future; that much of what has been broken can be repaired; that though we are many, we can be one; and that fatalism and cynicism are unwarranted and corrosive.</p><p>  除此之外，更重要的是，我们必须提醒自己，塑造未来并非无能为力。大部分被破坏的东西可以修复；尽管我们很多，但我们可以合而为一；宿命论和犬儒主义是毫无根据和腐蚀的。</p><p> There’s a lovely line in William Wordsworth’s poem “ The Prelude”: “What we have loved, Others will love, and we will teach them how.”</p><p> 威廉·华兹华斯（William Wordsworth）的诗《前奏》中有一句可爱的话：“我们所爱，别人会爱，我们将教他们如何。”</p><p> There are still things worthy of our love. Honor, decency, courage, beauty, and truth. Tenderness, human empathy, and a sense of duty. A good society. And a commitment to human dignity. We need to teach others—in our individual relationships, in our classrooms and communities, in our book clubs and Bible studies, and in innumerable other settings—why those things are worthy of their attention, their loyalty, their love. One person doing it won’t make much of a difference; a lot of people doing it will create a culture.</p><p> 仍有值得我们爱戴的事情。荣誉，体面，勇气，美丽和真理。温柔，人情和责任感。良好的社会。并致力于人类的尊严。我们需要在个人关系，教室和社区，读书俱乐部和圣经研究以及无数其他环境中教别人，为什么这些事值得他们注意，忠诚和爱戴。一个人这样做不会有多大改变；很多人这样做会创造一种文化。</p><p> Maybe we understand better than we did five years ago why these things are essential to our lives, and why when we neglect them or elect leaders who ridicule and subvert them, life becomes nasty, brutish, and generally unpleasant.</p><p> 也许我们更好地理解比我们五年前为什么这些事情都是我们的生命来说是必不可少的，为什么当我们忽视他们或选举产生领导人谁嘲笑和颠覆他们的生活变得肮脏，野蛮，一般不愉快。 </p><p> Just after noon on January 20, a new and necessary chapter will begin in the American story. Joe Biden will certainly play a role in shaping how that story turns out—but so will you and I. Ours is a good and estimable republic, if we can keep it.</p><p>1月20日正午之后，美国故事将开始一个新的必要章节。 乔·拜登（Joe Biden）当然会在塑造这个故事的结果中发挥作用-但是您和我也一样。如果我们能够保持下去，我们的共和国将是一个良好且可估计的共和国。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trump-losing-his-mind/617446/">https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trump-losing-his-mind/617446/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/特朗普/">#特朗普</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/trump/">#trump</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
