new computational study on 694 classic and contemporary novels suggests that how language is used reflects known psychological differences between men and women.\n  The findings also showed that, as predicted by cognitive neuroscience, gay male authors used language differently to straight men, in fact being closer to how straight women write, and lesbian women\u2019s writing was slightly shifted towards that of straight men.\n Dr Severi Luoto from the University of Auckland used computerised text analysis to dissect the writing styles of men and women of differing sexual orientation in an electronic sample of novels spanning from the beginning of the 19th century to the present day.\n He analysed 66.9 million words in all, from novels that were written mainly by British, American and Irish authors.\n The sample by heterosexual authors included canonical works such as James Joyce\u2019s  Ulysses, Jane Austen\u2019s  Sense and Sensibility, and Herman Melville\u2019s  Moby Dick, as well as works by contemporary bestselling authors.\n The homosexual samples included classics like John Rechy\u2019s  City of Night from 1963 and Radclyffe Hall\u2019s  The Well of Loneliness\u00a0 from 1928, as well as novels from a large number of contemporary gay and lesbian authors.\n In the study Dr Luoto says that compared with straight men, women used more social words, personal pronouns, positive emotion words and words related to sadness and anxiety.\n \u201cHeterosexual men, by contrast, used more articles, numbers, spatial words, death and anger-related words, swear words, and words that reflect analytical thinking.\u201d\n  Simply by analysing the frequencies of personal pronouns, articles, and numbers in a given novel (written by a heterosexual author), he says it would be possible to guess the sex of the author with about 72 percent accuracy.\n He says the findings largely aligned with known psychological sex differences such as men\u2019s higher systemising cognitive style, higher orientation towards &#39;things&#39; rather than people, and more pronounced spatial cognitive styles and abilities\u00a0\u2013 as well as women\u2019s more pronounced empathising cognitive style, emotionality, and people orientation.\n Fascinatingly, he says gay male authors had a female-typical writing style, characterised by high frequencies of cognitive process words, social words, personal pronouns, verbs, and words related to positive emotions, sadness, and anxiety.\n \u201cLike heterosexual women, gay men had lower frequencies of articles, analytical thinking words, spatial words, numbers, and death-related words than heterosexual men. By analysing the frequencies of personal pronouns, articles, and numbers in a given novel by a male author, it would be possible to guess whether they are heterosexual or homosexual with approximately 69 percent accuracy.\n \u201cThe gender shift hypothesis of homosexuality suggests that homosexual men are feminised while homosexual women are masculinised on certain neuro-behavioural and psychological traits. This hypothesis is generally supported in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, but the current study provides new support for it from literature,&#34; he says.\n Dr Luoto says the overall results suggest that previous estimates about the magnitude of sex differences in language use may have been underestimated.\n \u201cThis study introduced stricter controls than previous studies on sex differences in language use, including publication year, authors\u2019 age, authors\u2019 sexual orientation, and domain of writing, with only novels included. With these factors controlled for, the magnitude of sex differences was much larger in this study than has been reported earlier.\u201d\n He says the findings on this large corpus of 66.9 million words indicate how psychological group differences based on sex and sexual orientation manifest in language use across two centuries of literature.\n \u201cThe new findings on sexual orientation make a particularly important contribution to psychology and linguistics,\u201d he says.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 16:17:12", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8bed\u8a00,centuries,\u4f5c\u8005", "title": "\u8de8\u8d8a\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d ", "title_en": "Language use across centuries reveals sexual orientation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2021/06/15/language-use-across-centuries-reveals-sexual-orientation.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bed\u8a00", "centuries", "\u4f5c\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4ca010f8975fce44de34a88d5ccc4683.jpg", "infoid": 1067918, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\uff08\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u660e\u667a\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53cc\u5c42\u80a1\u4efd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u80a1\u7968\u548cB\u7ea7\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u660e\u667a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5728\u516c\u5171\u5e02\u573a\u8f6c\u5411\u516c\u5171\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u3002B\u7ea7\u80a1\u7968\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u3002\uff09\n \u201c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728A\u7ea7\u80a1\u4efd\u4e0a\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u9636\u7ea7\u80a1\u4efd\uff0c\u201d\u5728\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u6307\u51fa\u3002 \u201c\u80a1\u4efd\u7684\u5f00\u76d8\u4ef7\u5c06\u5728\u5165\u573a\u65e5\u671f\u5f00\u653e\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u201d\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u63a5\u5217\u8868\u6709\u70b9\u88ab\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7528\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u8def\u7ebf -

Class B shares are not tradeable.)\n \u201cThe Company will not set a price in respect of the class A shares or offer any class A shares in connection with the direct listing,\u201d it noted in the statement. \u201cThe opening price of the class A shares will be determined in the opening auction on the date of Admission.\u201d While direct listings have somewhat taken off as a route for tech companies to go public in the U.S. \u2014 a trend spearheaded by another European juggernaut, Spotify \u2014 this is a new turn for the LSE, which  published its own new rules on the process the same day that Wise announced its plans.\n  In the meantime, we can watch for more details around the public offering, and updates about the company\u2019s business, will be coming out in a prospectus and other related statements in the coming days and weeks.\n Bypassing the big investment banks and the related roadshow of a more conventional listing can be a bold move, one that companies who want to avoid the volatility and commitment of that process might opt to take if they feel they have enough momentum to hit the market directly. Wise in its statement today hinted that there has been some early interest, based on its share  offering to Wise customers.\n \u201cI am pleased to confirm our plans for a direct listing in London. This process will broaden the ownership of Wise, in support of our mission to move money around the world faster, cheaper and more conveniently,\u201d said\u00a0Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise, in a note in the statement. \u201cSince announcing our expected intention to float last week, we\u2019ve had over 60,000 expressions of interest in our customer shareholder programme, OwnWise, which is designed to reward customers who buy Wise shares and stick with us for the longer-term. This direct listing is about further aligning our mission and our shareholder base and I\u2019m enormously proud that customers want to be a part of that.\u201d\n Wise has been one of the huge success stories for fintech coming out of Europe, and London \u2014 founded by Estonians K\u00e4\u00e4rmann and Taavet Hinrikus, the company\u2019s been based out of London and has stuck with that even through all the financial turmoil of Brexit. Its 10 million customers currently process around $7 billion (\u00a35 billion) in cross-border transactions every month, which remains its primary business even as it diversifies into newer, related areas of financial services. In its most recent financial year, Wise\u2019s revenue grew to $586 million, up from $422 million.

Now, scientists have managed to slow down the atoms almost to a complete stop in the largest macro-scale object yet.\n The temperature of a given object is directly tied to the motion of its atoms \u2013 basically, the hotter something is, the more its atoms jiggle around. By extension, there\u2019s a point where the object is so cold that its atoms come to a complete standstill, a temperature known as absolute zero (-273.15 \u00b0C, -459.67 \u00b0F).\n Scientists have been able to  chill atoms and groups of atoms to a fraction above absolute zero for decades now, inducing what\u2019s called the motional ground state. This is a great starting point to then create exotic states of matter, such as  supersolids, or fluids that seem to have  negative mass.\n Understandably, it\u2019s much harder to do with larger objects, because they\u2019re made up of more atoms which are all interacting with their surroundings. But now, a large international team of scientists has broken the record for largest object to be induced into a motional ground state (or extremely closely to one, anyway).\n Most of the time, these experiments are done with clouds of millions of atoms, but the new test was performed on a 10-kg (22-lb) object that contains almost an  octillion atoms. Strangely enough, that \u201cobject\u201d isn\u2019t just one thing itself but the combined motion of four different objects, with a mass of 40 kg (88 lb) each.\n The researchers conducted the experiment at  LIGO, a huge facility famous for detecting gravitational waves as they wash over Earth. It does this by beaming lasers down two 4-km (2.5-mile) tunnels, and bouncing them back with mirrors \u2013 and those mirrors were the objects that the new study cooled to a motional ground state.\n Cooling atoms is simple in principle \u2013 you just have to counter their motion with an equal and opposite force. But that requires measuring their motion extremely precisely, and complicating things even further, the very act of measuring them can exert a new force on them.\n Intriguingly, the new study used this to the team\u2019s advantage. The photons of light in LIGO\u2019s lasers exert tiny bumps on the mirrors as they bounce off, and these disturbances can be measured in later photons. Since the beams are constant, the scientists have plenty of data about the motions of the atoms in the mirrors \u2013 meaning they can then design the perfect counteracting forces.\n To do so, the researchers attached electromagnets to the back of each mirror, which reduced their collective motion almost to the motional ground state. The mirrors moved less than one-thousandth the width of a proton, essentially cooling down to a crisp 77 nanokelvins \u2013 a hair above absolute zero.\n \u201cThis is comparable to the temperature atomic physicists cool their atoms to get to their ground state, and that\u2019s with a small cloud of maybe a million atoms, weighing picograms,\u201d says Vivishek Sudhir, director of the project. \u201cSo, it\u2019s remarkable that you can cool something so much heavier, to the same temperature.\u201d\n The team says that this breakthrough could enable new quantum experiments on the macro scale.\n \u201cNobody has ever observed how gravity acts on massive quantum states,\u201d says Sudhir. \u201cWe\u2019ve demonstrated how to prepare kilogram-scale objects in quantum states.

The result was a chemical reaction that created a slippery substance that turned out to be great at lifting dirt off skin and allowing it to be washed away.\n Written recipes for soap date back nearly 5,000 years, with variations from Mesopotamia, Egypt, ancient Greece, and Rome. Here\u2019s a method from an  alchemist\u2019s manual published sometime between the eighth and 10th centuries (even wizards who supposedly spent most of their time trying to turn lead into gold needed to do so with clean hands, apparently).\n \u201cSpread well burnt ashes from good logs over woven wickerwork \u2026 and gently pour hot water on them so it goes through drop by drop.\u2026 After it is clarified well, let it cook.\u2026 Add enough oil and stir very well.\u201d The age-old soap recipe comes from an astonishing how-to guide called the  Mappae Clavicula, which roughly translates from Latin as \u201cA Little Key to Everything.\u201d The alchemist\u2019s recipe for soap calls for either olive oil or beef tallow. Tallow, or animal fat, along with lye, remains a basic ingredient of soap. Fat reacts with lye\u2014a substance made in ashes that can be pretty toxic, which is why soap makers need to wear protective gear\u2014in a process called  saponification. The word possibly comes from the proto-German  saipo, which means \u201cto strain\u201d; the Latin  sebum, which translates as \u201cgrease\u201d; or from Mount Sapo, an Italian mountain whose location is now lost to history. (The story is that the drippings and ashes from the cook fires of the gods rolled down the hill and were discovered by filth-encrusted Romans.)\n Modern soap makers\u2014at least those working in small, artisanal operations\u2014use the same techniques. The saponification process yields a thick slurry. As it solidifies, fat neutralizes the caustic lye. \u201cAfter 48 hours, you\u2019ve got soap,\u201d says Natalie Wong, of Vancouver, British Columbia\u2019s Pep Soap, which offers both vegetable- and animal-fat-based bars.\n The slipperiness of soap  lowers the surface tension of the water you\u2019re mixing it with. Rubbing your hands together while washing allows dirt to temporarily bond with the water and soap and get washed away. The same process occurs with most viruses and bacteria that might be lingering on your hands. Soap doesn\u2019t kill these bugs\u2014it slips them up, lifting them from your skin, mixing them with water, and sending them down the drain. This chemical and mechanical reaction makes soap and water more effective, in general, than waterless sanitizing gels.\n How to choose and use (and make) sprays, wipes, and a bleach-based solution to disinfect surfaces.\n In America, the soap industry got started because of bacon\u2014and candles. Lighting is an integral part of the history of commercial cleansers, because both have traditionally been made from animal by-products. As the United States industrialized, people moved away from raising their own animals for slaughter, instead purchasing from butchers. In 1837, Cincinnati candlemaker William Procter expanded his attentions from lighting to soap, forming a company that would ultimately evolve\u2014with partner James Gamble\u2014into the world\u2019s largest consumer products company. (A good move, since gas lamps were  becoming popular, and Thomas Edison and others working with electricity would in a few short decades relegate candles to religious ceremonies and bathtime scene-setting.)\n One of the first soaps to gain national distribution was Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s Ivory. Originally introduced as a plain white soap, and designed to compete with Spanish castile soap (traditionally made from olive oil), the primary attribute of Ivory\u2014the name was adopted in the 1870s, after a biblical passage\u2014was that it floated, which the company claimed was an indicator of purity. A formal creation myth was manufactured for a product that was fundamentally the renderings of slaughtered livestock; the tale involved a mixing machine left on, an extended lunch break, and extra air accidentally pumped into a gooey agglomeration. In 2004, company archivists uncovered an 1863 diary entry, written by James Gamble, that seemed to dispel the legend of the buoyant accident: \u201cI made floating soap today,\u201d Gamble wrote. \u201cI think we\u2019ll make all of our stock that way.\u201d\n For most of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, soap companies made real soap. But in the early 1900s, German engineers discovered an alternate cleaning product: a synthetic called \u201cdetergent\u201d (rough Latin translation: to wipe away). Detergents didn\u2019t contain soap. Instead, they used enzymes that lifted stains off clothing and skin. American companies adopted and refined detergents, mixing ingredients to create surfactants, which, like soap, allowed dirt and grease to be pulled off the object being cleaned and into water. The reason for the move away from soap was simple, says Greg McCoy, Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s corporate archivist: \u201cDetergents clean better.\u201d\n The result is that what you\u2019re calling soap today probably isn\u2019t. At least not completely. \u201cMost body cleansers, both liquid and solid, are actually synthetic detergent products,\u201d states a Food &amp; Drug Administration  handout that provides the legal definition of soap. \u201cDetergent cleansers are popular because they make suds easily in water and don&#39;t form gummy deposits. Some of these detergent products are actually marketed as \u2018soap\u2019 but are not true soap according to the regulatory definition of the word.\u201d\n Modern cleansers can also contain additional ingredients, including brighteners, water softeners, and antibacterials/antivirals like alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, and chloroxylenol. (Triclosan, one of the most effective bacteria-fighting additives, is no longer found in US consumer products; it was banned in 2016 in light of medical and environmental concerns.) These modern cleaning bars can contain some of the same ingredients as soap\u2014animal fats, which appear on ingredient lists as sodium tallowate and sodium lardate, or vegetable fats like sodium palmitate and sodium cocoate\u2014but they are not, in the legal/chemical/alchemical sense, really soap.\n People in the Middle Ages faced disease and sickness, just as people do today. In the ancient alchemy manual, soap is described less as an object used in sanitation and more as an ingredient (gold solder can be made from a mixture of soap, copper, and a dyeing agent called calcothar). Riches from price-gouged bottles of hand sanitizers notwithstanding, it\u2019s a good thing that today\u2019s more complicated cleansers serve a more practical and urgent purpose.\n Bar or liquid? Antibacterial or not? Mass-produced or \u201cnatural\u201d? To slow the spread of the coronavirus, any kind of soap will do\u2014as long as you use it correctly.\n After more than 65 hours of research and testing 28 detergents, we found the  Seventh Generation Dish Liquid is the best for most people. You can\u2019t beat the cleaning power of Seventh Generation. Plus, the company doesn\u2019t use dyes or synthetic fragrances in its product, and it doesn\u2019t test on animals.\n The best cables and chargers will fill an iPhone 11\u2019s battery faster than the ones included in the box.\n Most sex toys require nothing more than soap and water to keep clean. But you can sanitize and even sterilize some toys using other simple methods.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 15:26:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

\n...... ", "note_en": "Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a set of techniques that dramatically speed up search-for-neighbors or near-duplication detection on data. These techniques can be used, for example, to filter out duplicates of scraped web pages at an impressive speed, or to perform near-constant-time lookups of nearby points from a geospatial data set.\n    Let\u2019s take a quick look at other types of hash functions to get a bird\u2019s-eye view of what counts as a  hash function, and how LSH fits into that world. A traditional use for hash functions is in  hash tables. As a reminder, the hash functions used in a hash table are designed to map a piece of data to an integer that can be used to look in a particular  bucket within the hash table to retrieve or delete that element. Many containers with string keys, such as JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries, are based on hash tables. Although hash tables might not  guarantee constant-time lookups, in practice they effectively provide them.\n  There are other classes of hash functions as well. For example, the  SHA-1 cryptographic hash function is designed to be  difficult to reverse, which is useful if you want to store someone\u2019s password as a hashed value. Hash functions like these are called   cryptographic hash functions.\n    They map some type of input, such as strings or floats, to discrete values, such as integers.\n  They\u2019re designed so that two inputs will result in hash outputs that are either different or the same based on key properties of the inputs.\n  Here\u2019s how LSH fits in: Locality-sensitive hash functions are specifically designed so that hash value collisions are  more likely for two input values that are  close together than for inputs that are far apart. Just as there are different implementations of secure hash functions for different use cases, there are different implementations of LSH functions for different data types and for different definitions of being  close together. I\u2019ll use the terms  neighbors or  being nearby to refer to points that we deem \u201cclose enough\u201d together that we\u2019d want to notice their similarity. In this post, I\u2019ll give a brief overview of the key ideas behind LSH and take a look at a simple example based on an idea called  random projections, which I\u2019ll define in section 2 below.\n    It will probably be much easier to grasp the main idea behind LSH with an example you can relate to. This way we can build some intuition before diving into those random projections that we\u2019ll use in the next section.\n  Suppose you have a million people from across the United States all standing in a huge room. It\u2019s your job to get people who live close together to stand in their own groups. Imagine how much time it would take to walk up to each person, ask for their street address, map that to a lat/long pair, then write code to find geographic clusters, and walk up to every person again and tell them how to find the rest of their cluster. I cringe just thinking about the time complexity.\n  Here\u2019s a much better way to solve this problem: Write every U.S. zip code on poster boards and hang those from the ceiling. Then tell everyone to go stand under the zip code where they live.\n  Voila! That\u2019s much easier, right? That\u2019s also the main idea behind LSH. We\u2019re taking an arbitrary data type (a person, who we can think of as a ton of data including their street address), and mapping that data into a set of discrete values (zip codes) such that people who live close together probably hash to the same value. In other words, the clusters (people with the same zip code) are very likely to be groups of neighbors.\n  A nice benefit of the zip code approach is that it\u2019s  parallel-friendly. Instead of requiring a center of communication, every person can walk directly to their destination without further coordination. This is a bit surprising in light of the fact that the result (clusters of neighbors) is based entirely on the  relationships between the inputs.\n  Another property of this example is that it is  approximate: some people may live across the street from each other, but happen to have different zip codes, in which case they would not be clustered together here. As we\u2019ll see below, it\u2019s also possible for data points to be clustered together even when they\u2019re very far apart, although a well-designed LSH can at least give some mathematical evidence that this will be a rare event, and some implementations manage to guarantee this can never happen.\n    In this section, I\u2019ll explain exactly how a relatively straightforward LSH approach works, explore some key parameters for this LSH system, and review why this technique is an order of magnitude faster than some other approaches.\n  Let\u2019s start with an incredibly simple mathematical function that we can treat as an LSH. Define  \\(h_1:{\\mathbb{R}}^2 \\to {\\mathbb{Z}}\\) for a point  \\(x=(x_1, x_2)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\) by\n    that is,  \\(h_1(x)\\) is the largest integer  \\(a\\) for which  \\(a\\le x_1.\\) For example,  \\(h_1((3.2, -1.2)) = 3.\\)\n  Let\u2019s suppose we choose points at random by uniformly sampling from the origin-centered circle  \\(\\mathcal C\\) with radius 4:\n  \\[ \\mathcal C := \\{ (x, y) : x^2 + y^2 \\le 4^2 \\}. \\]\n  Suppose we want to find which of our points in  \\(\\mathcal C\\) are close together. We can estimate this relationship by considering points  \\(a, b \\in \\mathcal C\\) to be clustered together when  \\(h_1(a) = h_1(b).\\) It will be handy to introduce the notation  \\(a \\sim b\\) to indicate that  \\(a\\) and  \\(b\\) are in the same cluster. With that notation, we can write our current hash setup as\n        You can immediately see that some points are far apart yet clustered, while others are relatively close yet unclustered. There\u2019s also a sense that this particular hash function  \\(h_1\\) was arbitrarily chosen to focus on the x-axis. What would have happened with the same data if we had used instead  \\(h_2(x) := \\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor?\\) The result is figure\u00a03.\n    While neither clustering alone is amazing, things start to work better if we use both of them simultaneously. That is, we can redefine our clustering via\n  \\[ a \\sim b \\iff \\begin{cases} h_1(a) = h_1(b), \\text{and} \\\\ h_2(a) = h_2(b). \\\\ \\end{cases} {\\class{smallscrneg}{ }}\\qquad(1)\\]\n      This does a much better job of avoiding clusters with points far apart, although, as we\u2019ll see below, we can still make some improvements.\n    So far we\u2019ve defined deterministic hash functions. Let\u2019s change that by choosing a random rotation matrix  \\(U\\) (a rotation around the origin) along with a random offset  \\(b \\in [0, 1).\\) Given such a random  \\(U\\) and  \\(b,\\) we could define a new hash function via\n    where I\u2019m using the notation  \\(( \\textit{vec} )_1\\) to indicate the first coordinate of the vector value  vec. (That is, the notation  \\((Ux)_1\\) means the first coordinate of the vector  \\(Ux\\).) This function is the  random projection I referred to earlier.\n  It may seem a tad arbitrary to use only the first coordinate here rather than any other, but the fact that we\u2019re taking a random rotation first means that we have the same set of possibilities, with the same probability distribution, as we would when pulling out any other single coordinate value.\n  A key advantage of using randomized hash functions is that any probabilistic statements we want to make about performance (e.g., \u201c99% of the time this algorithms will give us the correct answer\u201d) applies equally to all data, as opposed to applying to some data sets but not to others. As a counterpoint, consider the way quicksort is typically fast, but ironically uses  \\(O(n^2)\\) time to sort a pre-sorted list; this is a case where performance depends on the data, and we\u2019d like to avoid that. If we were using deterministic hash functions, then someone could choose the worst-case data for our hash function, and we\u2019d be stuck with that poor performance (for example, choosing maximally-far apart points that are still clustered together by our  \\(h_1\\) function above). By using randomly chosen hash functions, we can ensure that any average-case behavior of our hash functions applies equally well to all data. This same perspective is useful for hash tables in the form of   universal hashing.\n  Let\u2019s revisit the example points we used above, but now apply some randomized hash functions. In figure\u00a04, points are clustered if and only if both of their hash values (from  \\(h_1(x)\\) and  \\(h_2(x)\\)) collide. We\u2019ll use that same idea, but this time choose four rotations  \\(U_1, \\ldots, U_4\\) as well as four offsets  \\(b_1, \\ldots, b_4\\) to define  \\(h_1(), \\ldots, h_4()\\) via\n    Figure\u00a05 shows the resulting clustering. This time, there are 100 points since using more hash functions has effectively made the cluster areas smaller. We need higher point density to see points that are clustered together now.\n    It\u2019s not obvious that we actually want to use all four of our hash functions. The issue is that our clusters have become quite small. There are a couple ways to address this. One is to simply increase the scale of the hash functions; for example, set:\n    where  \\(s\\) is a scale factor. In this setup, larger  \\(s\\) values will result in larger clusters.\n  However, there is something a bit more nuanced we can look at, which is to allow some adaptability in terms of  how many hash collisions we require. In other words, suppose we have  \\(k\\) total hash functions (just above, we had  \\(k=4\\)). Instead of insisting that all  \\(k\\) hash values must match before we say two points are in the same cluster, we could look at cases where some number  \\(j \\le k\\) of them matches. To state this mathematically, we would rewrite equation (1) as\n    Something interesting happens here, which is that the  \\(a \\sim b\\) relationship is no longer a clustering, but becomes more like adjacency (that is, sharing an edge) in a graph. The difference is that, in a clustering, if  \\(a\\sim b\\) and  \\(b\\sim c,\\) then we must have  \\(a\\sim c\\) as well; this is called being  transitively closed. Graphs don\u2019t need to have this property. Similarly, it\u2019s no longer true that our similarity relationship  \\(a\\sim b\\) is transitively closed.\n  It may help your intuition to see this new definition of  \\(a\\sim b\\) in action on the same 100 points from figure\u00a05. This time, in figure\u00a06, there are twenty random hashes, and we\u2019re seeing the graphs generated by equation (3) using cutoff values (values of  \\(j\\)) of 6, 7, 8, and 9. The top-left graph in figure\u00a06 has an edge drawn between two points  \\(a\\) and  \\(b\\) whenever there are at least 6 hash functions  \\(h_i()\\) with  \\(h_i(a) = h_i(b),\\) out of a possible 20 used hash functions.\n    In fact, we can visualize all possible cutoff values of 6 or higher \u2014 these are values of  \\(j\\) in equation (3) \u2014 using a single image with weighted edges, as seen in figure\u00a07. Keep in mind that we haven\u2019t explicitly computed  any pairwise distances to arrive at this data.\n    There\u2019s another fun way to build intuition for what information our hashes provide. Let\u2019s visualize regions of the circle where all points have the same number of hash collisions with a given query point. We can do this by showing an example query point  \\(q\\), and shading each region based on the number of hash collisions the region\u2019s points have with  \\(q\\); this is shown in figure\u00a08. Every point in each shaded region has the same hash values for all the hash functions used. The first part of figure\u00a08 shows a scaled version of the two-hash system (using  \\(h_1()\\) and  \\(h_2()\\), similar to figure\u00a04) that we saw before; the second part uses 5 random hashes. The darkest region contains points  \\(p\\) where all hash values collide, so  \\(h_i(p) = h_i(q)\\) for all  \\(i\\). In a lightly shaded region that equation will only hold true for a smaller subset of the hash functions  \\(h_i().\\)\n  The second part of figure\u00a08 (with 5 hashes) shows nicer behavior, and I\u2019ll try to explain why. Imagine that we were drawing these same images for some theoretically perfect LSH setup that somehow managed to match point  \\(q\\) to every point  \\(p\\) with  \\(||p-q||\\le r\\) for some radius  \\(r\\); all other points were not matched. For that perfect LSH setup, images like figure\u00a08 would show a fixed-size circle with center at  \\(q\\) that moved along with  \\(q\\). With that in mind as the perfect LSH result, notice that the second part in figure\u00a08 is much closer to this ideal than the first part. Keep in mind that lookups within the shaded regions are no longer linear searches through data, but rather the intersection of  \\(k\\) hash table lookups \u2014 that is, lookups of nearby points are significantly faster.\n    It may further help your intuition to see how weighted edges connecting a point to its neighbors, like those in figure\u00a07, change as a single query point moives. This is the idea behind figure\u00a09, where weighted edges are drawn between a moving query point and 100 random points. Notice that the edge weightings make intuitive sense: they tend to connect strongly to very close neighbors, weakly to farther neighbors, and not at all to points beyond a certain distance.\n      So far, we\u2019ve seen that we can use hash lookups to find nearby neighbors of a query point, and that using  \\(k\\) different randomized hash functions gives us much more accurate lookups than if we used a single hash function. An interesting property of figure\u00a07 and figure\u00a09 is that we used different numbers of hash collisions \u2014 via the variable  \\(j\\) \u2014 to discover different degrees of similarity between points. In many applications, such as finding near duplicates or close geospatial points, we only want a binary output, so we have to choose a particular value for  \\(j\\). Let\u2019s discuss how to choose good values for  \\(j.\\)\n    To answer this question, let\u2019s temporarily consider what a perfect function would do for us. We\u2019ll call this function  search(q). In an ideal world this function returns all points within a fixed distance of the query point. We could visualize this as an  \\(n-\\)dimensional sphere around the query point  \\(q\\). A call to  search(q) ought to return all the indexed points  \\(p\\) that live within this sphere.\n  Let\u2019s move from that idealized algorithm into our fast-but-approximate world of locality-sensitive hashes. With this approach, there is no exact cutoff distance, although we keep the property that nearby neighbors are very likely to be in the returned list and distant points are very likely to be excluded. Since our hash functions are randomized, we can think of the neighbor relationship  \\(p\\sim q\\) as being a  random variable that has a certain probability of being true or false once all our parameters are fixed (as a reminder, our main parameters are  \\(j\\) and  \\(k\\)).\n  Now consider what great performance looks like in the context of this random variable. Ideally, there is some distance  \\(D\\) such that\n  \\[||p-q|| &lt; D-\\varepsilon {\\quad{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.8em}}}\\Rightarrow{\\quad{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.8em}}}P(p\\sim q) &gt; 1 - \\delta;\\]  \\[||p-q|| &gt; D+\\varepsilon {\\quad{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.8em}}}\\Rightarrow{\\quad{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.8em}}}P(p\\sim q) &lt; \\delta.\\]\n  In other words, this distance  \\(D\\) acts like a cutoff for our approximate search function. Points closer than distance  \\(D\\) to query point  \\(q\\) are returned, while points farther are not.\n  I wrote a Python script to calculate some of these probabilities for the particular parameters  \\(k=10\\) and  \\(d=2\\) ( \\(d\\) is the dimensionality of the points), and for various values of  \\(j\\). In particular, I restricted my input points to certain distances and measured the probability that they had at least  \\(j\\) hash collisions for different  \\(j\\) values. If you\u2019re familiar with conditional probabilities, then this value can be written as:\n    where I\u2019ve written  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) to denote that points  \\(p\\) and  \\(q\\) have at least  \\(j\\) hash collisions.\n  Using this Python script, I\u2019ve visualized the collision behavior of  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) for various  \\(j\\) in figure\u00a010. I\u2019ll go into more detail about what each tick on the box plot indicates, but the intuition is that shorter box plots are better because in this visualization a shorter box plot indicates a smaller range of uncertainty.\n    The most interesting element of this graph is that the best value of  \\(j\\) appears to be  \\(j=6.\\) You might have guessed that your best LSH approach is to insist that  all of your random hashes must collide before you consider two points to be neighbors, but this measurement shows that intuition to be false.\n  So what exactly did we measure in figure\u00a010? A traditional box plot visualizes the 25th and 75th percentiles of a set of scalar data points as the boundaries of the box. Often the median (50th percentile) is also shown within the box, but we don\u2019t include an analogous mark in figure\u00a010. The \u201cwhiskers\u201d at either end may indicate the minimum and maximum values, or something similar such as the extreme values after removing outliers.\n  In our case, we have one box plot for each value of  \\(j\\), and each plot has been normalized so that the bottom whiskers all align at value 1. (I\u2019ll explain why this is useful in a moment.) The bottom whisker indicates the distance between  \\(p\\) and  \\(q\\) so that  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) is true 99% of the time. The bottom of the box is the relative distance at which  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) is true 75% of the time. Continuing in this pattern, the box top corresponds to the distance at which we get collisions 25% of the time, and the top whisker is the distance at which we get collisions 1% of the time. Since the box plots are all normalized (meaning that the distances per  \\(j\\) value have all been divided through by the smallest distance), it\u2019s easy to visually see the ratio of each box plot position versus its smallest distance. In other words, it\u2019s easy to see which distance range is smallest.\n  Because I love math and precision, I\u2019m going to provide one last definition to formalize the idea of figure\u00a010. Given a value  \\(s \\in (0, 1)\\), define the distance  \\(D_s\\) as the value satisfying the given equation:\n    where  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) means that  \\(\\#\\{i : h_i(p) = h_i(q)\\} \\ge j.\\) Intuitively, if  \\(\\varepsilon\\) is close to zero, then the distance  \\(D_\\varepsilon\\) is large because the probability of  \\(p\\sim_j q\\) is small. The value of  \\(D_{1/2}\\) is the perfect distance so that  \\(p \\sim_j q\\) happens half of the time, and  \\(D_{1-\\varepsilon}\\) is a small distance where  \\(p \\sim_j q\\) happens almost all the time. Using this definition, the four values shown in each box plot of figure\u00a010, from bottom to top, are:\n  \\[D_{.99} / D_{.99} ,{\\;\\;{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.3em}}}D_{.75} / D_{.99} ,{\\;\\;{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.3em}}}D_{.25} / D_{.99} ,{\\;\\;{\\class{smallscr}{\\hskip -0.3em}}}D_{.01} / D_{.99}.\\]\n    So far we\u2019ve been sticking to 2-dimensional data because that\u2019s easier to visualize in an article. However, if you think about computing 10 hashes for every 2-dimensional point in order to find neighbors, it may feel like you\u2019re doing more work than the simple solution of a linear search through your points. Let\u2019s review cases where using an LSH is more efficient than other methods of finding nearby points.\n  There are two ways an LSH can speed things up: by helping you deal with a huge number of points, or by helping you deal with points in a high-dimensional space such as image or video data.\n    If you want to find all points close to a query point  \\(q,\\) you could execute a full linear search. A single-hash LSH can give you results in constant time. That\u2019s faster.\n  Things are slightly more complex for higher values of  \\(j\\) and  \\(k.\\) If you keep  \\(j=k,\\) then your LSH result is a simple intersection of  \\(k\\) different lists, each list being the set of hash collision points returned by a given randomized hash function  \\(h_i().\\) Finding this intersect\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 14:37:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6563\u5217,locality", "title": "\u5730\u533a\u654f\u611f\u6563\u5217\u7b80\u4ecb ", "title_en": "Introduction to Locality-Sensitive Hashing", "transed": 1, "url": "http://tylerneylon.com/a/lsh1/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6563\u5217", "locality"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "132ffa40afd709d6c239b5739fce973d.jpeg", "infoid": 1067912, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "It always seems impossible until it\u2019s done. And few fights have demonstrated this more than that against the monopoly abuses of big tech. For over a decade, the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook have been able to get away with murder in digital markets without fear of consequences. Wrapping their tentacles ever more forcefully around the world economy, threatening industry upon industry with subjugation, and watching their valuations rocket into the trillions, as investors grew giddy at the sight of the spoils.  But after several false starts at the US state level, we\u2019re finally witnessing the one governing body in the US that just might be large and powerful enough to withstand the army of lobbyists, the threats of retribution, and the sheer towering presence of trillions of dollars worth of power: The United States Congress.  Five bills were introduced last week by the chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, David Cicilline, and his fellow committee members. I had actually put off reading the bills directly for several days, because I feared the usual disappointment. That these bills were going to be timid, around-the-edges, squint-to-see-silverlining type of deals. I shouldn\u2019t have. These bills are bold. Really bold.  Well, some of them. Others are more like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. Like the  Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act by Neguse, which simply asks mega corporations to pay for proper inquiries into their proposed merges. Totally sensible, but not exactly defining a new epoch.  Next is the  ACCESS Act by Scanlon, which mandates interoperability for big tech, such that users can always take their data elsewhere. I think this is largely sensible, just like mandating portable phone numbers is, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exactly going to up-end the industry. You can already export all your emails from Gmail, yet barely anyone does. Still. Good basic consumer protection.  Then you get to the  Platform Competition and Opportunity Act by Jeffries, which is basically a ban on acquisitions for big tech. Wow. Okay, now you have my attention. You\u2019re telling me that Facebook wouldn\u2019t have been able to buy Instagram and WhatsApp, as a matter of basic law, not a prolonged merger approval inquiry? That\u2019s bold.  Next up is the  Ending Platform Monopolies Act by Jayapal. Which is essentially Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign proposal that you can\u2019t both own the market place and sell on it. That\u2019s super-duper bold. Essentially banning Amazon from carrying its own product lines on Amazon.com. But it also includes a ban on tying services, so Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to require app developers to use their in-app purchasing platform in order to list on the App Store. Or ban competitors from access to the App Store.   But I\u2019ve saved the best for last. Cicilline\u2019s own bill, which is cosponsored by republicans Ken Buck and Lance Gooden (and fellow democrat Jerry Nadler), essentially reads like a Christmas wishlist for any app developer or user of big tech. This bill has it all. It\u2019s the  American Choice and Innovation Online Act. And it\u2019s amazing.  You should go read it yourself. Hell, if you care about any of this stuff, you should read all the bills directly. They\u2019re mercifully short, relatively free of legal jargon, and strikingly bold. But anyway, here\u2019s a brief recap of the American Choice and Innovation Online Act:\n No more giving your own products and services preference if you own a dominant platform. So no more ads for Apple Arcade in your Settings app. No more hijacking all travel searches on Google to funnel travelers through their own booking services.\n No more cramming default apps that can\u2019t be uninstalled down user\u2019s throat. Remember how we just got the basic ability to set our own mail application on iOS this past summer? Yeah, it\u2019s that, but by law, applied to everything. Your own calendar app, your own messaging app, you own everything. Oh, and all those annoying preinstalled apps you don\u2019t want but the platform keeps pushing anyway now have to be uninstallable! Hurray!\n No more gag orders on developers. Apple won\u2019t be able to deny developers the right to link to their own damn website. Or tell them where to sign up for a service. Or even tell them that they have a paid service!\n NO MORE FORCING IN-APP PURCHASING ON DEVELOPERS!! The bill prevents tying the use of other services, like payment processing, to the ability to publish on the platform. All the dreaded language from Apple\u2019s App Store Guidelines with all the weird loopholes and exemptions for who is and isn\u2019t supposed to pay the 30% extortion will be illegal. Developers will have the freedom to publish on the App Store using their own payment processing (or use Apple\u2019s, should they prefer!).\n Basic protections against discrimination and retaliation. This essentially turns the app stores into common carriers. Which is an established antitrust idea of forcing platform owners to offer the same deal to everyone. Just like Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from shaking down individual websites. This bill will prevent app store platforms from shaking down individual app makers according to their whims.\n All this is backed up by the potent penalties of up to 15% of the platform owner\u2019s revenue or 30% of injured party\u2019s revenue, whichever is larger. There\u2019s some poetic justice in those rates, as they\u2019re exactly the same as the payment extortion fees demanded by Apple and Google of some app developers.  The FTC and the antitrust division\u2019s attorney general are in charge of enforcing general compliance with the law. But injured parties are also eligible to sue directly under the law. Not just for penalties and damages, but also for injunctions.  If this law had been on the books last summer, we would never have had to endure  those awful two weeks of intimidation and threats from Apple when we launched HEY. Presumably Apple wouldn\u2019t even have tried, because there would have been no  3.1.1, but even if they would have, the case to get an injunction would have been a slam dunk.  Didn\u2019t I tell you these bills were bold? If they pass Congress in anywhere near their current forms, we have a veritable revolution on our hands for the digital economy. Powerful protections against big tech abusing their monopoly advantage to shakedown individual developers and entire industries. Strong boundaries to prevent the platforms from expanding their power and marketshare even further through predatory acquisitions. Excellent consumer protections to ensure you can always get your data out, and have the choice to install your preferred default apps for all kinds of services.  But the party isn\u2019t over yet! The main enforcer of all these new bills will be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and guess who  just got confirmed as the chair of that commission?  LINA KAHN!! You seriously could not wish for a more qualified or determined enforcer of these new laws than her. She\u2019s been instrumental in shaping the modern outlook on antitrust, and moving us beyond that dreaded and outdated \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard that has allowed big tech to run roughshod over everyone else unopposed. She was a driving force behind the House Antitrust Subcommittee\u2019s series of hearings and the ultimate report on digital markets that directly lead to all these new bill proposals. She\u2019s big tech\u2019s worst nightmare and the dream chair for the rest of us.  Sure, you say, but these bills still have to pass Congress before they become law. True, but look at the sponsors for all of these bills. Each and every one of them have sponsors on both the democratic and republican side. Opposition to big tech\u2019s monopoly abuses is one of the very few truly bipartisan issues in Washington these days. I think these bills have an excellent chance to pass exactly because of that.  Taken all together, even just this promise of a chance \u2013  just one chance! \u2013 to strike at the heart of big tech and end their reign of abuse is invigorating. It\u2019s far more than I could ever have hoped for when I showed up in Colorado in January of last year to  testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. It more than makes up for the disappointment of seeing Apple and their lobbyists kill the democratic attempts at accountability at the state level.  And as if all of this wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s not like things have been quiet on the eastern front either. In Europe, the German competition authorities, called The Bundeskartellamt, just announced  they\u2019re pursuing Apple for violations of the a new January 2021 amendment to the German Competition Act. This act gives more teeth and more bite to investigating and sanctioning monopoly abusers, and Apple is the first target in their sights.   At  Basecamp, we continue to work with other competition authorities in Europe as well. Just like we\u2019ve done here in the US. Because the power of big tech is not constrained to a single country or territory. It\u2019s a global power that demands a global response. And after more than a decade of slumber on this issue, the leviathans around the globe are finally waking up, and big tech is about to meet the one real obstacle to world domination: Sovereign governments with democratic mandates.

This might be due to  inotify not being available on FreeBSD. Sublime Text 4 also has this issue. You can remedy this somewhat by using  this Sublime Text extension and manually updating the tree view.\n  The  Sublime Linter extension seems to work fine and shows errors while you are coding.\n  You also will need to restart Sublime Text when you change any settings or install any extensions for the changes to take affect.\n      Surprisingly the tree view for VSCode updates on file changes - perhaps they revert to polling when no other mechanism is available?\n    You will need to restart VSCode or reload the window from the command palette for a change in settings to take affect (again I think this is because it relies on inotify internally). Installing extensions don&#39;t  seem to need a restart.\n  The  Axe VSCode extension isn&#39;t supported on FreeBSD. Not a huge issue as I can use the browser extension and perhaps the cli tools.\n  There&#39;s a weird issue when using the VSCode debugger where it will open a duplicate version of the file the debugger/breakpoint statment is in. My fix was to switch to using  node --inspect from the command line and then using Chromium to inspect. I also installed  this Chrome extension to automatically attach and open the debugger window in Chromium.\n    I couldn&#39;t find a native GUI REST client (e.g.  Postman) for FreeBSD, but I did find REST extensions for both VSCode and Chromium which do basically the same thing:\n      These npm libraries I&#39;m currently using didn&#39;t work on FreeBSD without a fix:  trash-cli - fix: there is a python version that works fine on FreeBSD:\u00a0  pip install trash-cli --user\n  bundlesize - fix: this didnt work because it couldnt find the  python2 binary. I did have python 2.7 installed, but the binary is called   python2.7. People on the FreeBSD discord mentioned that I should just create a symlink like so:  ln -s $(which python2.7) ~/.local/bin/python2. After that bundlesize installed fine.\n  pre-commit - fix: needs to have the shebang changed in  ./node_modules/pre-commit/hook and  ./.git/hooks/pre-commit. Here&#39;s a one-liner to fix a shebang:  awk &#39;$0 = NR==1 ? replace : $0&#39; replace=&#34;\\#\\!\\/usr\\/bin\\/env bash&#34; ./.git/hooks/pre-commit &gt; tmpfile &amp;&amp; mv tmpfile ./.git/hooks/pre-commit. I ended up adding the following script to my  package.json file so the scripts are fixed on install/reinstall of npm libs (task is an npm library i use for build tasks in my project):   Weirdly enough, the shebang issue has already been fixed by the pre-commit library authors, but it seems npm is hosting the old version of the file which is weird. I might open an issue to report it.\n    Geany is available on FreeBSD and is a very capable editor. It can even be used as a fairly decent Sublime Text replacement:\n  Unfortunately it doesnt have LSP support yet \ud83d\ude25. Although as an alternative,  Kate is available in ports and does have LSP support built in.\n            There is no MongoDB GUI manager in ports, although it&#39;s possible a Linux MongoDB GUI app could work on FreeBSD via Linuxulator.\n        I had a hard time finding a GUI hashing client (e.g. hash the SHA1 of a file), however I found that this windows program works just fine on FreeBSD with wine:  https://www.den4b.com/products/hasher.\n    I was fearful that either  Electron wouldn&#39;t be supported on FreeBSD or it would only support an ancient version, but as of June 23, 2020, FreeBSD has an  Electron port of Electron version 12.0.9, which is only one major release behind what is currently out \ud83d\udc4d\n      You can also create a shortcut to  DevDocs in chromium so it opens in a window and has a proper icon in the dock/taskbar. To do this, go to the file menu in Chromium, select More Tools, then Create Shortcut, and check the open in window checkbox.\n      There is a new version of the Evernote website that is very capable. You can make Evernote web have its own window and dock/taskbar icon by opening the file menu in Chromium, select More Tools, then Create Shortcut, and check the open in window checkbox.\n  If you want a keyboard shortcut to focus the Evernote window, you can use xdotool:  xdotool windowactivate $(xdotool search --name &#34;Evernote&#34;)\n        I couldn&#39;t find any GUI programs for image compression for FreeBSD, however the google squoosh app works offline, so you can just install that as a PWA with Chromium:  https://squoosh.app/\n            There are a tonne of terminals available for FreeBSD. My favourite one  Guake is available too, however the one in ports seemed to be broken for me. Installing the latest one via  pip install guake --user worked a treat.\n    There are a couple of very basic git gui clients available - eg  Gitg,  Git Cola,  QGit\n  For the moment i am using the  built in git features in VSCode. When coupled with  Git Lens, VSCode becomes a very nice Git GUI client.\n  I did manage to get  SmartGit to start by changing some things in its bash startup script (since its just a java app) but it wasn&#39;t able to use the git executable, it gave a permission denied error? - dunno what that was about\n          The latest non-LTS nodejs version available in ports is one minor version behind the latest.\n    When getting the cpu core count in Python  os.cpu_count() returns the cpu threads count and  len(os.sched_getaffinity(0)) errors as sched_getaffinity is not available on FreeBSD. However  int(os.popen(&#34;sysctl -n kern.smp.cores&#34;).read().split(&#39;\\n&#39;)[0]) returns the correct core count.    sed on BSD doesn&#39;t support every feature the Linux version supports.

", "note_en": "Singer directly addresses the court: \u2018This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good\u2019\n    Britney Spears has called for an end to the \u201cabusive\u201d conservatorship that has governed her life for 13 years, delivering an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court and saying: \u201cI just  want my life back.\u201d\n Spears addressed the court during a hearing on the unusual legal arrangement that has stripped the singer of her independence since 2008. The conservatorship has given her father, Jamie Spears,  control over her estate, career and other aspects of her personal life.\n  \u201cI want to end the  conservatorship without being evaluated,\u201d Spears said in a lengthy speech, during which she condemned her father and the others who have controlled the arrangement.\n \u201cThis conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,\u201d she said. \u201cI deserve to have a life ... I\u2019m great at what I do. All I want is to own my money \u2026 [and] share my story to the world. I want to be able to be heard.\u201d\n  Spears said she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and having a baby. She said she wanted to get her birth control removed so she could try to have another child, but that she was not allowed to go to the doctor. She said her boyfriend is also prohibited from driving her in his car, and that she is blocked from seeing some friends.\n  She directly excoriated her father, saying, \u201cHe loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%.\u201d At one point, she said, she cried for an hour on the phone and said he \u201cloved\u201d it and enjoyed having control over someone as powerful as her.\n \u201cI\u2019ve lied and told the whole world I\u2019m OK and I\u2019m happy,\u201d Spears said, adding that she wanted to sue her family. She compared her situation to \u201csex trafficking\u201d, noting that she was forced to work while having no control over her finances and no independence: \u201cThe people who did that to me should not be able to walk away so easily.\u201d\n Spears, who appeared by phone and spoke rapidly, said her management had threatened to sue her if she didn\u2019t perform in 2018: \u201cIt was very threatening and scary ... I\u2019m not here to be anyone\u2019s slave.\u201d\n She said her management falsely accused her of not taking her medication at the time. She also said the conservatorship has recently forced her to attend therapy in Westlake, where she gets bombarded by the paparazzi, and she requested that she be allowed to do therapy in her home: \u201cI deserve privacy \u2026 It\u2019s not OK to force me to do anything I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n She said she was at one point forced to take lithium, which was very strong: \u201cI felt drunk. I couldn\u2019t even have a conversation with my mom or dad really about anything ... my whole family did nothing.\u201d At the hearing, she requested that she be allowed to choose her own lawyer, and that she be permitted to speak out, noting that her parents give media interviews while she is barred from talking to press.\n \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be in a conservatorship if I can work,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe laws need to change \u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I can live a full life.\u201d\n  In a short statement at the end of the hearing, Vivian Thoreen, the attorney for Jamie Spears, said: \u201cHe is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain. Mr Spears loves his daughter and misses her very much.\u201d\n The judge, Brenda Penny, said the singer\u2019s lawyer could file a formal petition to end the conservatorship.\n  The singer\u2019s appearance was highly anticipated; the 39-year-old star almost never participates in the court proceedings, but her lawyer this year  told the judge she wanted to speak out and requested a hearing \u201con an expedited basis\u201d.\n It also comes one day after the New York Times reported on  confidential documents revealing that Spears has for years strongly objected to the conservatorship and the many powers her father has had over her.\n Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, fans had gathered hours before the hearing was due to start, wearing #FreeBritney flags and shirts and holding cardboard cutouts of the star.\n \u201cI want people to understand that this is unacceptable. This is not a gray area, he-said-she-said situation. In my view, a crime has been committed against Britney Spears,\u201d said Tess Barker, the co-host of the popular Britney\u2019s Gram podcast, who has consistently attended the singer\u2019s hearings.\n Carlos Morales, 26, who showed up with a large Britney flag, added, \u201cShe\u2019s been with me all my life. Her music is inspiration to me, and I\u2019m here to support her and pay her back.\u201d\n Fellow celebrities also voiced their support for Spears following the hearing. \u201cWe love you Britney!!! Stay strong,\u201d Mariah Carey  tweeted, while Brandy  said she was sending \u201clove and support to Britney Spears and her fans\u201d. The actor and activist  Rose McGowan; the Planned Parenthood president,  Alexis McGill Johnson; and the View co-host  Meghan McCain also spoke out on Twitter against Spears\u2019 conservatorship.\n Justin Timberlake, her former boyfriend who has faced  widespread scrutiny for the way he treated the star,  tweeted, \u201cWe should all be supporting Britney at this time \u2026 No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.\u201d\n Conservatorship is a type of  court-appointed guardianship intended for people who can no longer make decisions for themselves, typically older and infirm people. But critics have argued that the process can be exploited and have pointed to Spears\u2019s case as an example of such abuse.\n  Spears\u2019s arrangement has faced intense scrutiny in the months since the release of  Framing Britney Spears, a New York Times-produced documentary that chronicled the fraught process that led the courts to place the singer under a conservatorship. The film cast a harsh light on the abusive paparazzi and media that aggressively covered Spears\u2019s mental health challenges, and also depicted her father as being largely absent from her life until he took control of her estate amid the singer\u2019s struggles.\n A lawyer who claimed to have met with Spears in 2008 told the film-makers that she had said at the time she did not want her father as a conservator. The documentary further highlighted the apparent contradictions of her arrangement \u2013 that she could be performing sold-out shows and making millions, but also be considered incapable of making basic decisions about her health and finances.\n  Spears\u2019s lawyers, appointed by the court, filed for  Jamie to be removed as a conservator last year, alleging that the singer was \u201cafraid of her father\u201d and claiming she would not perform while he continued to exercise control of her estate. Jamie is a co-conservator of the estate alongside a corporate fiduciary, known as Bessemer Trust.\n Her father had previously acted as a personal conservator, giving him authority over her medical and mental health treatment, but a  professional licensed conservator has taken over that job.\n   The Times report on Tuesday revealed that Spears told a court investigator in 2016 that the conservatorship had \u201cbecome an oppressive and controlling tool against her\u201d and she had raised concerns that the arrangement gave her father authority over who she dated and befriended, how she designed her kitchen and how much money she was given as a weekly allowance. She also said she was forced to perform while sick with a 104F fever.\n #FreeBritney activists, who were featured in the documentary, have pushed for Jamie to be ousted and for the conservatorship to be entirely dissolved.\n \u201cI want her to be able to speak freely from her heart, and I\u2019m praying that the judge actually listens,\u201d said Junior Olivas, a #FreeBritney advocate, before the hearing. \u201cThe whole world is watching this case, and the time is now for Britney to really let them know what she wants.\u201d\n The 33-year-old longtime fan, who appeared in the documentary, has for years rallied outside the courtroom in support of the singer.\n  \u201cIn the beginning, no one paid attention or laughed us off \u2026 but finally people are paying attention and actually understanding that something is wrong here.\u201d The revelations this week added fuel to their cause, he said: \u201cShe was crying for help but nobody was listening.\u201d\n Megan Radford, another #FreeBritney advocate, noted that male celebrities have not faced the same kind of scrutiny and loss of autonomy when they have suffered public breakdowns.\n \u201cIt\u2019s dangerously stigmatizing to say someone who may or may not have mental health struggles needs to have their rights stripped away from them and reassigned to another human being,\u201d she added. The Times report, she said, made clear that the \u201cjustice system has failed Britney \u2026 She has been totally robbed of 13 years of her life for no reason.\u201d\n \u201cI watched Britney grow up. I\u2019ve been a fan since she was a teenager,\u201d said Kim Van Doorn, 45, outside the courthouse on Wednesday. Van Doorn came with her wife to LA, traveling from Bakersfield, hours north of the courthouse. \u201cI want whatever she wants for her future. But of course as a fan, I want her to continue to make music and come back as the bad Britney bitch that she is.\u201d\n Spears  appeared to endorse the #FreeBritney movement in a statement from her lawyer last year that said, \u201cBritney welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans.\u201d Her father had dismissed the campaign as a conspiracy theory.\n A representative for Jamie\u2019s lawyer declined to comment on the New York Times report on Tuesday. His attorney told reporters in February, \u201cJamie Spears has diligently and professionally carried out his duties as one of Britney\u2019s conservators, and his love for his daughter and dedication to protecting her is clearly apparent to the court.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 13:03:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6cd5\u9662,life,\u4fdd\u62a4", "title": "\u201c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u547d\u201d\uff1a\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u8981\u6c42\u6cd5\u9662\u7ec8\u6b62\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u7edf ", "title_en": "\u2018I deserve to have a life\u2019: Britney Spears asks court to end conservatorship", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/22/britney-spears-conservatorship-testimony", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6cd5\u9662", "life", "\u4fdd\u62a4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9512c53decdc81063297d46a78796d72.png", "infoid": 1067906, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u590d\u5236\u5e76\u5206\u4eab\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f2b\u753b\uff08\u4f46\u4e0d\u5356\u6389\u5b83\u4eec\uff09\u3002 \u66f4\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u3002 ", "note_en": "This means you&#39;re free to copy and share these comics (but not to sell them).

Imagine trying to explain that to an alien or to a time traveler from the 20th century. \u201cAmazon turned 20 and on the eve of its birthday, the company introduced Prime Day, a global shopping event,\u201d reads Amazon\u2019s formal  telling of the ritual\u2019s 2015 origins. \u201cOur only goal? Offer a volume of deals greater than Black Friday, exclusively for Prime members.\u201d The holiday was invented by a corporation in honor of itself, to enrich itself. It has existed for six years and is observed by tens of millions of people worldwide. I hope you are spending it with your loved ones.\n Prime Day is a singular and strange artifact, but then again, so is Prime, Amazon\u2019s $119-a-year membership service, which buys subscribers free one-day shipping, plus access to streaming media, discounts at the Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods, and a  host of other perks. Prime is Amazon\u2019s greatest and most terrifying invention: a product whose value proposition is to help you buy more products. With  200 million subscribers worldwide, it is the second-most-popular subscription service on Earth,  poised to overtake Netflix in the not-so-distant future.\n This popularity is both extremely logical and a little perplexing. When you subscribe to Prime, you\u2019re paying to pledge your fealty to a single company\u2019s ecosystem\u2014something that consumers once wanted to avoid. You\u2019re paying to have your every purchase cataloged\u2014also something consumers  aren\u2019t wild about, at least in theory\u2014so that Amazon can use that information to sell you, and people like you, more goods. You\u2019re paying to become part of a system that is purpose-built to keep you paying, forever, and to keep Amazon growing, forever, like a katamari ball or an avalanche or, in Amazon\u2019s corporate argot, a \u201c flywheel.\u201d\n A flywheel is really just a heavy wheel. Because it\u2019s so heavy, it\u2019s hard to push\u2014but once it gets spinning, all that weight helps it build momentum, and more momentum, ever faster. Low prices draw customers in, which provides Amazon with more data, more bargaining power, more market share, and more advantageous economies of scale, which then allows it to gobble up more businesses, grow its footprint, build more warehouses, increase selection, and lower prices even more\u2014which then draws even more customers in. \u201cWe look for virtuous cycles everywhere,\u201d Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s former CEO of consumer business,  said in a 2012 company meeting. \u201cThings that are complete, closed loop, and that as you inject energy into each piece of them, the flywheel spins faster and faster.\u201d The idea, he said in the meeting, was originally written on a napkin by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s CEO. \u201cThat napkin will eventually be in the Smithsonian Institution, I imagine,\u201d he added. It should be.\n W , in 2005, Amazon was relatively small, and still known mostly for books. As the company\u2019s former director of ordering, Vijay Ravindran,  told  Recode\u2019s Jason Del Rey in 2019, Prime \u201cwas brilliant. It made Amazon the default.\u201d It created incentives for users to be loyal to Amazon, so they could recoup the cost of membership, then $79 for unlimited two-day shipping. It also enabled Amazon to better track the products they buy and, when video streaming was added as a perk in 2011, the shows they watch, in order to make more things that the data indicated people would want to buy and watch, and to surface the things they were most likely to buy and watch at the very top of the page. And most important, Prime habituated consumers to a degree of convenience, speed, and selection that, while unheard-of just years before, was made standard virtually overnight.\n \u201cIt is genius for the current consumer culture,\u201d Christine Whelan, a clinical professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told me. \u201cIt encourages and then meets the need for the thing, so we then continue on the  hedonic treadmill: Buy the latest thing we want and then have it delivered immediately and then buy the next latest thing.\u201d\n  Prime\u2014especially in combination with the Amazon app\u2014makes buying just about anything as easy as possible. With traditional retail, \u201cthere\u2019s the friction of having to go to the store, there\u2019s the friction of will the store have it, there\u2019s the friction of carrying it,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cThere\u2019s the friction of having to admit to another human being that you\u2019re buying it. And when you remove the friction, you also remove a lot of individual self-control. The more you are in the ecosystem and the easier it is to make a purchase, the easier it is to say yes to your desire rather than no.\u201d According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners,  Prime members spend more than twice as much a year on Amazon purchases as non-Prime users, and more than 90 percent renew their subscription after the first year.\n This type of loyalty is remarkable. \u201cIt used to be that being a consumer was all about choice,\u201d says Emily West, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the author of the forthcoming book   Buy Now: How Amazon Branded Convenience and Normalized Monopoly. But now, \u201c two-thirds of people start their product searches on Amazon.\u201d Prime discourages comparison shopping\u2014looking around is pointless when everything you need is right here\u2014even as Amazon\u2019s sheer breadth of products makes shoppers feel as if they have agency.\n \u201cConsumerism has become a key way that people have misidentified freedom,\u201d says Jake Alimahomed-Wilson, a sociology professor at California State University at Long Beach and co-editor of   The Cost of Free Shipping: Amazon in the Global Economy. \u201cBut what Amazon represents is a corporate infrastructure that is increasingly directed at getting as many consumers as possible locked into a consumerist process\u2014an Amazon consumer for life.\u201d Amazon offers  steep discounts to college students and  new parents, two groups that are highly likely to change their buying behavior. It keeps adding more discounts and goodies to the Prime bundle, making subscribing ever more appealing. And, in an especially sinister move, it makes quitting Prime  maddeningly difficult.\n  As subscription numbers grew through the 2010s, the revenue from them helped Amazon pump more money into building fulfillment centers (to get products to people even faster), acquiring new businesses (to control even more of the global economy), and adding more perks to the bundle (to encourage more people to sign up). The market share also helped Amazon negotiate lower rates with package carriers, which further bolstered its bottom line. In 2019, Amazon shaved a full day off its delivery time, making one-day shipping the default, and also making Prime an even more tantalizing proposition: Why hop in the car for anything at all when you could get it delivered tomorrow, for free?\n A  Prime is infrastructure. It\u2019s how America shops. That was true for more than 100 million of us before the coronavirus pandemic drove the world inside, but roughly  30 million additional people in the U.S. signed up for the service last year, meaning that the United States now has  more Prime memberships than  households. In 2020, Amazon\u2019s revenue from subscriptions  alone\u2014mostly Prime\u2014was  $25.2 billion, which is a 31 percent increase from the previous year, and also about three times the revenue of the  entire NBA. The flywheel, and the hedonic treadmill, is spinning faster than ever.\n Thanks in large part to the revenue from Prime subscriptions and from the things subscribers buy, Amazon\u2019s value has multiplied roughly 97 times, to $1.76 trillion, since the service was introduced. Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the United States, after Walmart, and it is  responsible for roughly 40 percent of all e-commerce in the United States. (Walmart is second, with roughly 7 percent.) It controls  hundreds of millions of square feet across the country and  is opening more fulfillment centers all the time. It has acquired  dozens of other companies,  most recently the film studio MGM for $8.5 billion. Its  cloud-computing operation, Amazon Web Services, is the largest of its kind and provides the plumbing for a vast swath of the internet, to a  profit of $13.5 billion last year. Amazon has entered some 40 million American homes in the form of the Alexa smart speaker, and some 150 million American pockets in the form of the Amazon app; both, of course, make shopping for paper towels effortless and even fun, something you can do while chopping vegetables or watching television, further feeding the Amazon perpetual-motion machine.\n It is now possible to live a full, even typical, life while consuming things only from Amazon or one of its subsidiaries: grocery shopping at Whole Foods, wearing clothes bought on Shopbop and Zappos, kicking back with  The Man in the High Castle on Fire TV at night, maybe looking up the actors on IMDb as you do, before listening to an Audible book as you doze off. Amazon has been the subject of  numerous antitrust inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits\u2014most recently a lawsuit alleging that the company  punishes sellers who list their products more cheaply on other sites\u2014though none of these has yet resulted in meaningful changes to the company. The stakes are high; Amazon is now  moving aggressively into online advertising, a space currently dominated by Facebook and Google, where it will likely leverage the tremendous amount of consumer data it gleans every second from its online and brick-and-mortar storefronts to sell hyper-targeted ads.\n  \u201cAmazon is a beast we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Alimahomed-Wilson told me. \u201cAmazon powers our Zoom calls. It contracts with ICE. It\u2019s in our neighborhoods. This is a very different thing than just being a large retailer, like Walmart or the Ford Motor Company.\u201d\n Sometimes I find it useful to compare Big Tech to climate change, another force that is altering the destiny of everyone on Earth, forever. Both present themselves to us all the time in small ways\u2014a creepy ad here, an uncommonly warm November there\u2014but are so big, so abstract, so everywhere that they\u2019re impossible for any one person to really understand; to do so would be like asking a fly perched on your forehead to draw a portrait of you, or a person being engulfed by a tsunami to describe the shape of the wave. Both are the result of a decades-long, very human addiction to consumption and convenience that has been made grotesque and extreme by the incentives and mechanisms of the internet, market consolidation, and economic stratification. Both have primarily been advanced by a  small handful of  very big companies that are invested in making their machinations unseeable to the naked eye.\n Speed and convenience aren\u2019t actually free; they never are.  Free shipping isn\u2019t free either. It just obscures the real price. Getting hand sanitizer and toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles and sex toys delivered to your door, contact-free, as a contagious disease ravaged the globe didn\u2019t mean that no one was venturing into the life-threatening outside; it just meant  you weren\u2019t. Next-day shipping comes with tremendous costs: for labor and logistics and transportation and storage; for the people who pack your stuff into those smiling boxes and for the people who deliver them; for the planes and trucks and vans that carry them; for the warehouses that store them; for the software ensuring that everything really does get to your door on time, for air-conditioning and gas and cardboard and steel. Amazon\u2014Prime in particular\u2014has done a superlative job of making all those costs, all those moving parts, all those externalities invisible to the consumer.\n  Amazon warehouse workers spend their days  picking and packing in million-square-foot warehouses where they face  punishing productivity expectations,  constant surveillance,  high turnover, and  serious injuries, for a  starting wage of $15 an hour. The pandemic drove up demand for Amazon, and for labor: Last year, company profits shot up 70 percent, Bezos\u2019s personal wealth grew by  $70 billion, and  1,400 people a day joined the company\u2019s workforce.\n Amazon\u2019s warehouses bring  traffic and  pollution to the neighborhoods they\u2019re in, many of which are  poor. After products leave the warehouse, they are shipped,  at no small cost to the planet, to their destination. Sometimes they\u2019re picked up by FedEx or UPS or the post office, but because of the volume of packages and the need to deliver them next-day, many are ferried by a  network of subcontracted delivery drivers who are under intense pressure to deliver hundreds of packages a day and sometimes  hit and kill people while doing it. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. In 2019, Amazon said that reports about its delivery subcontractors \u201cdo not provide an accurate representation of Amazon\u2019s commitment to safety.\u201d It has also held that its high injury rates are the result of fastidiousness about recording injuries.)\n  Prime is the financial engine keeping Amazon\u2019s fulfillment-and-delivery machine running, and also the argument for its existence. If consumers don\u2019t expect packages in 24 hours, there\u2019s no reason to require workers to scan a new one  every 11 seconds until their discs bulge. But those expectations\u2014and their costs\u2014are bigger than Prime, or even Amazon, because Amazon is so big that every sector of our economy has bent to respond to the new way of consuming that it invented. Prime isn\u2019t just bad for Amazon\u2019s workers\u2014it\u2019s bad for Target\u2019s, and Walmart\u2019s. It\u2019s bad for the people behind the counter at your neighborhood hardware store and bookstore,  if your neighborhood still has a hardware store and a bookstore. Amazon has accustomed shoppers to a pace and manner of buying that depends on a miracle of precision logistics even when it\u2019s managed by one of the biggest companies on Earth. For the smaller guys, it\u2019s downright impossible.\n \u201cAmazon is a shadow that we can always see,\u201d Danny Caine, the owner of Raven Book Store, in Lawrence, Kansas, and the author of   How to Resist Amazon and Why, told me. \u201cEvery decision we make is based upon the fact that Amazon can get these books cheaper and faster. The prevailing expectation is you can get anything online shipped for\u201d\u2014 he scrunched his fingers into air quotes\u2014\u201c\u2018free,\u2019 in one or two days. And there\u2019s really only one company that can do that. They do that because they\u2019re willing to push and exploit their workers.\u201d\n I  like climate change, subscribing to Prime is like flying: a personal choice that pales in comparison with what government intervention could do. Just as abstaining from flying for moral reasons won\u2019t stop sea-level rise, one person canceling Prime won\u2019t do much of anything to a multinational corporation\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically insignificant to Amazon. They\u2019ll never feel it,\u201d Caine told me. But, he said, \u201cthe small businesses in your neighborhood will absolutely feel the addition of a new customer. Individual choices do make a big difference to them.\u201d\n  And in the case of Prime, what you and the world are paying for isn\u2019t a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Bali or a weekend with Grandma; it\u2019s the right to get Command hooks delivered to your house in 12 hours. Whelan teaches a class at UW called Consuming Happiness, and she is fond of giving her students the adage that you can buy happiness\u2014\u201cif you spend your money in keeping with your values: spending prosocially, on experiences. Tons of research shows us this.\u201d\n Prime, she told me, clearly fails that test. Abstaining from flying for moral reasons\u2014and there are many\u2014cuts you off from some of the most important experiences of modern life. Abstaining from Prime for moral reasons\u2014and there are many\u2014returns you to a life you probably had less than a decade ago: going to the store, standing in line, lugging your bags on the train or up the stairs.\n Prime\u2019s neatest trick was making that life unimaginable. It has hastened the decline of the local small businesses we\u2019d be shopping at if Amazon didn\u2019t exist, and it has bought up so many other companies that even if you avoid Amazon.com, you\u2019re probably still shopping at Amazon. It has rewired the way Americans think about what is possible to have, and how fast. It has placed all of us atop the flywheel. Some small number of us may emerge from the pandemic and realize we don\u2019t need to be here. But many more\u2014especially those with children, those living in rural areas, those with disabilities, those who work long hours\u2014are stuck, running ever faster. I asked Whelan, who has three kids under 10, if she\u2019d ever consider canceling Prime, given what she knows about how it short-circuits the consumer brain. She paused for a beat, then told me no. \u201cAmazon is the service that keeps our life moving.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 12:18:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

", "note_en": "Warren Buffett announced on Wednesday that he\u2019s donating $4.1 billion of Berkshire Hathaway shares to five foundations \u2014 and he\u2019s stepping down from his role as a trustee of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,  one of the largest philanthropies in the world. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO made the announcement as he shared the latest update on his charitable giving, while defending the pace at which he\u2019s been donating his immense fortune. Now 90 years old, Buffett says he\u2019s halfway toward his goal of giving up nearly all of his net worth.\n Buffett was not specific about why he is resigning from the Gates Foundation, which has been a primary beneficiary of his donations for more than a decade. In his letter, the billionaire noted that his goals were \u201c100% in sync\u201d with the foundation, that he\u2019d been an \u201cinactive trustee,\u201d and that he\u2019d resigned from \u201call other corporate boards other than Berkshire Hathaway.\u201d\n Buffett\u2019s announcement comes less than two months after Bill and Melinda Gates  announced their divorce and as Bill Gates  faces ongoing scrutiny over past workplace conduct and extramarital affairs. The focus of Buffett\u2019s letter, however, seems to address how he approaches philanthropy at a time of intense criticism of wealth inequality and billionaire power. Buffett generally defended his accumulation of wealth, and seems to be arguing that the benefits of compounding interest have justified his gradual approach to selling off his shares.\n Meanwhile, the $4.1 billion donation is not necessarily surprising. The business magnate has been talking about giving away most of his wealth since at least 2006, when he announced he would  donate most of his wealth to the Gates Foundation. He\u2019s since made regular large donations of Berkshire Hathaway shares to the foundation, and in 2010, he worked with the Gateses to establish the Giving Pledge, a  public pact among the ultrarich to donate at least half of their wealth to charity. Many billionaires, including MacKenzie Scott and Mark Zuckerberg, have  since signed on. Now that it\u2019s been 15 years since his original announcement about giving to the Gates Foundation, Buffett recognizes that philanthropy is complicated.\n \u201cThe easiest deed in the world is to give away money that will never be of any real use to you or your family. The giving is painless and may well lead to a better life for both you and your children,\u201d Buffett wrote in the letter. \u201cThe second step of disbursing huge sums is more challenging, particularly when the goal is to focus on crucial problems that have long been difficult to conquer or even dent.\u201d\n But Buffett is giving away his money more slowly than some other billionaires. Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, announced earlier this month she was  donating $2.7 billion of her wealth to various causes. Overall, she has given away $8.5 billion in the past year; at the end of 2020, she was giving away  $1 billion a month. Scott has also diverged from other members of the ultrarich in giving her money directly to organizations, rather than through foundations. She has also criticized the economy that enabled her wealth, which she\u2019s called \u201csystems in need of change.\u201d\n That\u2019s a strikingly different tone from Buffett, who on Wednesday noted that he made his fortune doing what he loved.\n \u201cCompound interest, a long runway, wonderful associates and our incredible country have simply worked their magic,\u201d he wrote.\n It\u2019s worth noting that many billionaires, including  Bezos and Laurene Powell Jobs, have not  signed the Giving Pledge, and others have been slow to come up with a clear and deliberate strategy  for their philanthropy. Billionaires are also growing increasingly unpopular. Vox and Data for Progress polling from earlier this year found that the American public is skeptical of the idea that billionaires are role models and frustrated by the growth of their wealth in the  pandemic. New reporting into how the rich sidestep  federal income taxes makes these figures even less sympathetic.\n This all means the importance of and dynamics behind billionaire philanthropy is only growing. Billionaires become more plentiful and more powerful, making charities more dependent on their funds and their critics more restless to rein in the power of the ultrarich. That growing frustration with the rich, and how they use their money, stands in stark contrast to the words of Buffett, who seems otherwise content as he steps back from his roles.\n \u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d Buffett wrote in closing. \u201cThough naysayers abound \u2014 as they have throughout my life \u2014 America\u2019s best days most certainly lie ahead. What\u2019s happened here since 1776 has not been a historical fluke.\u201d\n    Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

As we grow older, black, brown, blonde or red strands lose their youthful hue. Although this may seem like a permanent change, new research reveals that the graying process can be undone\u2014at least temporarily.\n  Hints that gray hairs could spontaneously regain color have existed as isolated case studies within the scientific literature for decades. In one 1972 paper, the late dermatologist Stanley Comaish reported an encounter with a 38-year-old man who had what he described as a \u201c most unusual feature.\u201d Although the vast majority of the individual\u2019s hairs were either all black or all white, three strands were light near the ends but dark near the roots. This signaled a reversal in the normal graying process, which begins at the root.\n  In a study published today in  eLife, a group of researchers provide  the most robust evidence of this phenomenon to date in hair from around a dozen people of various ages, ethnicities and sexes. It also aligns patterns of graying and reversal to periods of stress, which implies that this aging-related process is closely associated with our psychological well-being.\n  These findings suggest \u201cthat there is a window of opportunity during which graying is probably much more reversible than had been thought for a long time,\u201d says study co-author  Ralf Paus, a dermatologist at the University of Miami.\n  Around four years ago  Martin Picard, a mitochondrial psychobiologist at Columbia University, was pondering the way our cells grow old in a multistep manner in which some of them begin to show signs of aging at much earlier time points than others. This patchwork process, he realized, was clearly visible on our head, where our hairs do not all turn gray at the same time. \u201cIt seemed like the hair, in a way, recapitulated what we know happens at the cellular level,\u201d Picard says. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s something to learn there. Maybe the hairs that turn white first are the more vulnerable or least resilient.\u201d\n  While discussing these ideas with his partner, Picard mentioned something in passing: if one could find a hair that was only partially gray\u2014and then calculate how fast that hair was growing\u2014it might be possible to pinpoint the period in which the hair began aging and thus ask the question of what happened in the individual\u2019s life to trigger this change. \u201cI was thinking about this almost as a fictive idea,\u201d Picard recalls. Unexpectedly, however, his partner turned to him and said she had seen such two-colored hairs on her head. \u201cShe went to the bathroom and actually plucked a couple\u2014that\u2019s when this project started,\u201d he says.\n  Picard and his team began searching for others with two-colored hairs through local ads, on social media and by word of mouth. Eventually, they were able to find 14 people\u2014men and women ranging from nine to 65 years old with various ethnic backgrounds (although the majority were white).  Those individuals provided both single- and two-colored hair strands from different parts of the body, including the scalp, face and pubic area.\n  The researchers then developed a technique to digitize and quantify the subtle changes in color, which they dubbed hair pigmentation patterns, along each strand. These patterns revealed something surprising: In 10 of these participants, who were between age nine and 39, some graying hairs regained color. The team also found that this occurred not just on the head but in other bodily regions as well. \u201cWhen we saw this in pubic hair, we thought, \u2018Okay, this is real,\u2019\u201d Picard says. \u201cThis happens not just in one person or on the head but across the whole body.\u201d He adds that because the reversibility only appeared in some hair follicles, however, it is likely limited to specific periods when changes are still able to occur.\n  Most people start noticing their first gray hairs in their 30s\u2014although some may find them in their late 20s.This period, when graying has just begun, is probably when the process is most reversible, according to Paus. In those with a full head of gray hair, most of the strands have presumably reached a \u201cpoint of no return,\u201d but the possibility remains that some hair follicles may still be malleable to change, he says.\n  \u201cWhat was most remarkable was the fact that they were able to show convincingly that, at the individual hair level, graying is actually reversible,\u201c says  Matt Kaeberlein, a biogerontologist at the University of Washington, who was one of the editors of the new paper but was not involved in the work. \u201cWhat we\u2019re learning is that, not just in hair but in a variety of tissues, the biological changes that happen with age are, in many cases, reversible\u2014this is a nice example of that.\u201d   \u00a0 \rThe team also investigated the association between hair graying and psychological stress because prior research  hinted that such factors  may accelerate the hair\u2019s aging process. Anecdotes of such a connection are also visible throughout history: according to legend, the hair of Marie Antoinette, the 18th-century queen of France, turned  white overnight just before her execution at the guillotine.   \rIn a small subset of participants, the researchers pinpointed segments in single hairs where color changes occurred in the pigmentation patterns. Then they calculated the times when the change happened using the known average growth rate of human hair: approximately one centimeter per month. These participants also provided a history of the most stressful events they had experienced over the course of a year.\n  This analysis revealed that the times when graying or reversal occurred corresponded to periods of significant stress or relaxation. In one individual, a 35-year-old man with auburn hair, five strands of hair underwent graying reversal during the same time span, which coincided with a two-week vacation. Another subject, a 30-year-old woman with black hair, had one strand that contained a white segment that corresponded to two months during which she underwent marital separation and relocation\u2014her highest-stress period in the year.\n  Eva Peters, a psychoneuroimmunologist at the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg in Germany, who was not involved in this work, says that this is a \u201cvery creative and well-conceptualized study.\u201d But, she adds, because the number of cases the researchers were able to look at was relatively small\u2014particularly in the stress-related portion of the study\u2014further research is needed to confirm these findings.\n  For now, the next step is to look more carefully at the link between stress and graying. Picard, Paus and their colleagues are currently putting together a grant to conduct another study that would examine changes in hair and stress levels prospectively\u2014which means tracking participants over a specified period of time rather than asking them to recall life events from the past.\n  Eventually, Picard says, one could envision hair as a powerful tool to assess the effects of earlier life events on aging\u2014because, much like the rings of a tree, hair provides a kind of physical record of elapsed events. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the hair encodes part of your biological history in some way,\u201d he says. \u201cHair grows out of the body, and then it crystallizes into this hard, stable [structure] that holds the memory of your past.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 11:33:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7070\u8272,turns,\u5934\u53d1", "title": "\u5b66\u4e60\u8bf4\uff0c\u538b\u529b\u8f6c\u52a8\u7070\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u53ef\u9006\u7684 ", "title_en": "Stress Turns Hair Gray, But It's Reversible, Study Says", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gray-hair-can-return-to-its-original-color-mdash-and-stress-is-involved-of-course/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7070\u8272", "turns", "\u5934\u53d1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067898, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "10\uff1a35P\u7b49\uff1a\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5feb\u7167\u9700\u898110\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u5236\u4f5c\u3002 \u901a\u5e38\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u6b63\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c06\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u7167\u3002 \u4f46\u6240\u6709\u7684Mongo DBS\u90fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u62cd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u8fd1\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u5feb\u7167\u3002 \u4e00\u65e6\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u590d\u5236DB\u548c\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; LL\u56de\u5f52\u3002  9\uff1a54P\u7b49\uff1a\u5723\u83ab\u5229\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u5207\u6362\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684Mongo DB\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u5e03\u5c14\u7684Mongo\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6301\u6709Newsblur\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4eba\u8d28\u3002 \u6211\u51e0\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u524d\u5c31\u8638\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5907\u4efd\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u60a8\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u3002 ", "note_en": "10:35p ET: Looks like the snapshot will take 10 hours to make.

", "note_en": "On a clear day, the view from the ruins of G\u00f6bekli Tepe stretches across southern Turkey all the way to the Syrian border some 50 kilometres away. At 11,600 years old, this mountaintop archaeological site has been described as the world\u2019s oldest temple \u2014 so ancient, in fact, that its T-shaped pillars and circular enclosures pre-date pottery in the Middle East.\n The people who built these monumental structures were living just before a major transition in human history: the Neolithic revolution, when humans began farming and domesticating crops and animals. But there are no signs of domesticated grain at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, suggesting that its residents hadn\u2019t yet made the leap to farming. The ample animal bones found in the ruins prove that the people living there were accomplished hunters, and there are signs of massive feasts. Archaeologists have suggested that mobile bands of hunter-gatherers from all across the region came together at times for huge barbecues, and that these meaty feasts led them to build the impressive stone structures.\n Now that view is changing, thanks to researchers such as Laura Dietrich at the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. Over the past four years, Dietrich has discovered that the people who built these ancient structures were fuelled by vat-fulls of porridge and stew, made from grain that the ancient residents had ground and processed on an almost industrial scale  1. The clues from G\u00f6bekli Tepe reveal that ancient humans relied on grains much earlier than was previously thought \u2014 even before there is evidence that these plants were domesticated. And Dietrich\u2019s work is part of a growing movement to take a closer look at the role that grains and other starches had in the diet of people in the past.\n The researchers are using a wide range of techniques \u2014 from examining microscopic marks on ancient tools to analysing DNA residues inside pots. Some investigators are even experimentally recreating 12,000-year-old meals using methods from that time. Looking even further back, evidence suggests that some people ate starchy plants more than 100,000 years ago. Taken together, these discoveries shred the long-standing idea that early people subsisted mainly on meat \u2014 a view that has fuelled support for the palaeo diet, popular in the United States and elsewhere, which recommends avoiding grains and other starches.\n The new work fills a big hole in the understanding of the types of food that made up ancient diets. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching a critical mass of material to realize there\u2019s a new category we\u2019ve been missing,\u201d says Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanist at University College London.\n  Dietrich\u2019s discoveries about the feasts at G\u00f6bekli Tepe started in the site\u2019s \u2018rock garden\u2019. That\u2019s the name archaeologists dismissively gave a nearby field where they dumped basalt grinding stones, limestone troughs and other large pieces of worked stone found amid the rubble.\n As excavations continued over the past two decades, the collection of grinding stones quietly grew, says Dietrich. \u201cNobody thought about them.\u201d When she started cataloguing them in 2016, she was stunned at the sheer numbers. The \u2018garden\u2019 covered an area the size of a football field, and contained more than 10,000 grinding stones and nearly 650 carved stone platters and vessels, some big enough to hold up to 200 litres of liquid.\n  \u201cNo other settlement in the Near East has so many grinding stones, even in the late Neolithic, when agriculture was already well-established,\u201d Dietrich says. \u201cAnd they have a whole spectrum of stone pots, in every thinkable size. Why so many stone vessels?\u201d She suspected that they were for grinding grain to produce porridge and beer. Archaeologists had long argued that stone vats at the site were evidence of occasional ceremonial beer consumption at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, but thought of it as a rare treat.\n Teasing answers from the stones there and at other sites is not a simple process. In archaeology, it is much easier to spot evidence of meat meals than ones based on grains or other plants. That\u2019s because the bones of butchered animals fossilize much more readily than do the remains of a vegetarian feast. The fragile nature of ancient plant remains makes archaeobotany \u2014 the study of how ancient people used plants \u2014 tricky, time-consuming work. Researchers use sieves, fine mesh and buckets to wash and separate debris from archaeological sites. Tiny bits of organic material such as seeds, charred wood and burnt food float to the top, while heavier dirt and rocks sink.\n The vast majority of what emerges amounts to the raw ingredients, the bits that never made it into a pot. By identifying and counting grass seeds, grain kernels and grape pips mixed into the soil, archaeobotanists can tell what was growing in the area around the settlement. Unusual amounts of any given species offer circumstantial evidence that those plants might have been used, and perhaps cultivated, by people in the past.\n  Some of the earliest evidence for plant domestication, for example, comes from einkorn wheat grains recovered from a site near G\u00f6bekli Tepe that are subtly different in shape and genetics from wild varieties  2. At G\u00f6bekli Tepe itself, the grains look wild, suggesting that domestication hadn\u2019t taken place or was in its earliest stages. (Archaeologists suspect that it might have taken centuries for domestication to alter the shape of grains.)\n Direct proof that plants landed in cooking pots is harder to come by. To work out what people were eating, archaeologists are turning to previously ignored sources of evidence, such as charred bits of food. They\u2019re the mistakes of the past: stews and porridge left on the fire for too long, or bits of bread dropped in the hearth or burnt in the oven. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s cooked a meal knows sometimes it burns,\u201d says Lucy Kubiak-Martens, an archaeobotanist working for BIAX Consult Biological Archaeology &amp; Environmental Reconstruction in Zaandam, the Netherlands.\n Until the past few years, these hard-to-analyse remnants of ruined meals were rarely given a second look. \u201cIt\u2019s just a difficult material. It\u2019s fragile, ugly stuff,\u201d says Andreas Heiss, an archaeobotanist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. \u201cMost researchers just shied away.\u201d Pottery sherds encrusted with food remains were cleaned off or discarded as \u2018crud ware\u2019, and charred bits of food were dismissed as unanalysable \u2018probable food\u2019 and shelved or thrown out.\n The first step towards changing that perception was to go back to the kitchen. That was the inspiration of Soultana Valamoti, an archaeobotanist at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece who, not coincidentally, is also a passionate home cook. Valamoti spent the early years of her career toting buckets and sieves from one excavation site to another across Greece, all while combing museum storerooms for ancient plant remains to analyse. The work convinced her there was an untapped wealth of evidence in burnt food remains \u2014 if she could find a way to identify what she was looking at.\n More than 20 years ago, Valamoti decided to turn her lab into an experimental kitchen. She ground and boiled wheat to make bulgur, and then charred it in an oven to simulate a long-ago cooking accident (see \u2018Fast food of the Bronze Age\u2019). By comparing the burnt remains to 4,000-year-old samples from a site in northern Greece, she was able to show that the ancient and modern versions matched, and that this way of preparing grain had its roots in the Bronze Age  3.\n  Over the decade that followed, she continued experimenting. Beginning in 2016, a European Research Council grant allowed her to create a crusty, charred reference collection of more than 300 types of ancient and experimental samples. After making bread dough, baked bread, porridge, bulgur and a traditional food called trachana from heirloom wheat and barley, Valamoti chars each sample in an oven under controlled conditions.\n She than magnifies the crispy results by 750 to 1,000 times to identify the tell-tale changes in cell structure caused by different cooking processes. Whether boiled or fresh, ground or whole, dried or soaked, the grains all look different at high magnification. Baking bread leaves tell-tale bubbles behind, for example, whereas boiling grain before charring it gelatinizes the starch, Valamoti says. \u201cAnd we can see all that under the scanning electron microscope.\u201d\n  Comparing the ancient samples with her modern experiments, Valamoti has been able to go beyond identifying plant species to reconstruct the cooking methods and dishes of ancient Greece. There is evidence that people in the region have been eating bulgur for at least 4,000 years  4. By boiling barley or wheat and then drying it for storage and quick rehydration later, \u201cyou could process the harvest in bulk and take advantage of the hot sun\u201d, Valamoti says. \u201cThen you can use it throughout the year. It was the fast food of the past.\u201d\n Other researchers are also pursuing ancient cooking mistakes. Charred food remains \u201care providing us with direct evidence of food\u201d, says Amaia Arranz-Otaegui, an archaeobotanist at the Paris Museum of Natural History. \u201cThat\u2019s revolutionary. It\u2019s an unprecedented source of information.\u201d\n In the past, it has been difficult for researchers to find hard evidence that our distant ancestors ate plants. \u201cWe\u2019ve always suspected starch was in the diet of early hominins and early  Homo sapiens, but we didn\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d says Kubiak-Martens.\n Genetic data support the idea that people were eating starch. In 2016, for example, geneticists reported  5 that humans have more copies of the gene that produces enzymes to digest starch than do any of our primate relatives. \u201cHumans have up to 20 copies, and chimpanzees have 2,\u201d says Cynthia Larbey, an archaeobotanist at the University of Cambridge, UK. That genetic change in the human lineage helped to shape the diet of our ancestors, and now us. \u201cThat suggests there\u2019s a selective advantage to higher-starch diets for  Homo sapiens.\u201d\n  To find supporting evidence in the archaeological record, Larbey turned to cooking hearths at sites in South Africa dating back 120,000 years, picking out chunks of charred plant material \u2014 some the size of a peanut. Under the scanning electron microscope, she identified cellular tissue from starchy plants  6 \u2014 the earliest evidence of ancient people cooking starch. \u201cRight through from 120,000 to 65,000 years ago, they\u2019re cooking roots and tubers,\u201d Larbey says. The evidence is remarkably consistent, she adds, particularly compared with animal remains from the same site. \u201cOver time they change hunting techniques and strategies, but still continue to cook and eat plants.\u201d\n Early humans probably ate a balanced diet, leaning on starchy plants for calories when game was scarce or hard to hunt. \u201cAnd being able to find carbohydrates as they moved into new ecologies would have provided important staple foods,\u201d Larbey adds.\n Evidence suggests that plants were popular among Neanderthals, too. In 2011, Amanda Henry, a palaeoanthropologist now at Leiden University in the Netherlands, published her findings from dental plaque picked from the teeth of Neanderthals who were buried in Iran and Belgium between 46,000 and 40,000 years ago. Plant microfossils trapped and preserved in the hardened plaque showed that they were cooking and eating starchy foods including tubers, grains and dates  7. \u201cPlants are ubiquitous in our environment,\u201d Henry says, \u201cand it\u2019s no surprise we put them to use.\u201d\n  In May, Christina Warinner, a palaeogeneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her colleagues reported the extraction of bacterial DNA from the dental plaque of Neanderthals, including a 100,000-year-old individual from what is now Serbia. The species they found included some that specialized in breaking down starch into sugars, supporting the idea that Neanderthals had already adapted to a plant-rich diet  8. Plaque on the teeth of early modern humans shared a similar bacterial profile, providing more evidence to suggest that they were eating starchy plants.\n The finds push back against the idea that our ancestors spent their time sitting around campfires mostly chewing on mammoth steaks. It\u2019s an idea that has penetrated popular culture, with proponents of the palaeo diet arguing that grains, potatoes and other starchy foods have no place on our plates because our hunter-gatherer ancestors didn\u2019t evolve to eat them.\n But it has become clear that early humans were cooking and eating carbs almost as soon as they could light fires. \u201cThe old-fashioned idea that hunter-gatherers didn\u2019t eat starch is nonsense,\u201d says Fuller.\n  The push to better understand how people were cooking in the past also means paying more attention to the cooks themselves. It\u2019s part of a larger trend in archaeology to look at household activities and daily lives. \u201cEssentially, we\u2019re trying to figure out what kind of information you can find out about people who have never had histories written about them,\u201d says Sarah Graff, an archaeologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n In the past, when researchers found plant remains at archaeological sites, they often considered them as accidental \u2018ecofacts\u2019 \u2014 natural objects, such as seeds, pollen and burnt wood, that offer evidence for what kind of plants grew in a region. But there has been a shift towards treating food remains as evidence of an activity that required craft, intent and skill. \u201cPrepared food needs to be looked at as an artefact first and a species second,\u201d Fuller says. \u201cHeated, fermented, soaked \u2014 making food is akin to making a ceramic vessel.\u201d\n  And, as researchers increasingly collaborate to compare ancient remains, they\u2019re finding remarkable similarities across time and cultures. At Neolithic sites in Austria dating back more than 5,000 years, for example, archaeologists found unusually shaped charred crusts. It was as though the contents of a large jar or pot had been heated until the liquid burned off, and the dried crust inside began to burn. The team\u2019s first guess was that the crusts were from grain storage jars destroyed in a fire. But under the scanning electron microscope, the cell walls of individual grains looked unusually thin \u2014 a sign, Heiss says, that something else was going on.\n After comparing the Austrian finds to similar crusts found in Egyptian breweries from around the same time, Heiss and Valamoti concluded that the thin cell walls were the result of germination, or malting, a crucial step in the brewing process. These early Austrian farmers were brewing beer  9. \u201cWe ended up with something completely different\u201d from the earlier hypotheses, Heiss says. \u201cSeveral lines of evidence really interlocked and fell into place.\u201d\n Bread, it seems, goes even further back. Arranz-Otaegui was working at a 14,500-year-old site in Jordan when she found charred bits of \u2018probable food\u2019 in the hearths of long-ago hunter-gatherers. When she showed scanning electron microscope images of the stuff to Lara Gonz\u00e1lez Carretero, an archaeobotanist at the Museum of London Archaeology who works on evidence of bread baking at a Neolithic site in Turkey called \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, both researchers were shocked. The charred crusts from Jordan had tell-tale bubbles, showing they were burnt pieces of bread  10.\n  Most archaeologists have assumed that bread didn\u2019t appear on the menu until after grain had been domesticated \u2014 5,000 years after the cooking accident in question. So it seems that the early bakers in Jordan used wild wheat.\n The evidence provides crucial clues to the origins of the Neolithic revolution, when people began to settle down and domesticate grain and animals, which happened at different times in various parts of the world. Before farming began, a loaf of bread would have been a luxury product that required time-consuming and tedious work gathering the wild grain needed for baking. That hurdle could have helped to spur crucial changes.\n Arranz-Otaegui\u2019s research suggests that \u2014 at least in the Near East \u2014 demand for bread might have been a factor in driving people to attempt to domesticate wheat, as they looked for ways to ensure a steady supply of baked goods. \u201cWhat we are seeing in Jordan has implications for bigger processes. What drove the transition to agriculture is one of the fundamental questions in archaeology,\u201d Arranz-Otaegui says. \u201cThis shows hunter-gatherers were using cereals.\u201d\n The next frontier for archaeobotanists is prehistoric salad bars. Researchers are working on ways to look for the remains of food that wasn\u2019t cooked, such as leafy greens, another overlooked part of the ancient diet. Because raw greens and vegetables are even harder to find in the archaeological record than cooked seeds and grains, Kubiak-Martens calls them the \u201cmissing link\u201d in knowledge about ancient diets. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to prove green leaves were eaten from charred remains,\u201d Kubiak-Martens says. \u201cBut you would be surprised at how much green vegetables are in human coprolites\u201d, or preserved faeces. Kubiak-Martens got a grant in 2019 to look at 6,300-year-old palaeofaeces preserved at wetland sites in the Netherlands, which she hopes will reveal everything prehistoric farmers there had on their dinner tables.\n  The quest to understand ancient diets has led some researchers to take extreme measures. That\u2019s the case with G\u00f6bekli Tepe, which has yielded very few organic remains that could provide clues to the prehistoric plant-based meals there. So Dietrich has tried innovative thinking \u2014 and a lot of elbow grease. Her approach has been to recreate the tools people used to make food, not the dishes themselves.\n In her airy lab on a tree-lined street in Berlin, Dietrich explains her time-consuming and physically demanding process. Starting with a replica grindstone \u2014 a block of black basalt the size of a bread roll that fits neatly in the palm of her hand \u2014 she photographs it from 144 different angles.\n After spending eight hours grinding four kilograms of heirloom einkorn wheat kernels, Dietrich photographs the stone again. A software program then produces 3D models from the two sets of pictures. Her experiments have shown that grinding fine flour for baking bread leaves a different finish on the stones from producing coarsely ground grain that is ideal for boiling as porridge or brewing beer.\n And after handling thousands of grindstones, she is often able to identify what they were used for by touch. \u201cI touch the stones to feel for flattening,\u201d she says. \u201cFingers can feel changes at the nano level.\u201d By comparing the wear patterns on her modern replicas to the stones piled in G\u00f6bekli Tepe\u2019s rock garden, Dietrich could show that fine-ground bread flour was the exception. In a 2020 study  11, she argues people there were mostly grinding grain coarsely, just enough to break up its tough outer layer of bran and make it easy to boil and eat as porridge or ferment into beer.\n To test the theory, Dietrich commissioned a stonemason to carve a replica of a 30-litre stone vat from G\u00f6bekli Tepe. In 2019, she and her team successfully cooked porridge using heated stones, carefully recording and timing each step of the process. They also brewed a Neolithic beer from hand-ground germinated grain, or malt, in the open vessel. The results were \u201ca bit bitter, but drinkable\u201d, Dietrich says. \u201cIf you\u2019re thirsty in the Neolithic.\u201d\n From the grind stones and other plant-processing tools at G\u00f6bekli Tepe, a picture is now emerging for what was going on there 12,000 years ago. Rather than just starting to experiment with wild grains, the monument builders were apparently proto-farmers, already familiar with the cooking possibilities grain offered despite having no domesticated crops. \u201cThese are the best grinding tools ever, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of grindstones,\u201d Dietrich says. \u201cPeople at G\u00f6bekli Tepe knew what they were doing, and what could be done with \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 11:32:06", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5564\u9152,people,\u8c37\u7269", "title": "\u53e4\u4ee3\u4eba\u5982\u4f55\u7231\u4e0a\u9762\u5305\uff0c\u5564\u9152\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u78b3\u6c34\u5316\u5408\u7269 ", "title_en": "How ancient people fell in love with bread, beer and other carbs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5564\u9152", "people", "\u8c37\u7269"]}]
