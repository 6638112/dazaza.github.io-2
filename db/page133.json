", "note_en": "The Chromium team has patched a  2.5-year-old bug that made it possible to stage cross-site scripting ( XSS) attacks on web pages, even if they had been configured to prevent XSS attacks.\n Discovered by Jun Kokatsu, browser security researcher at  Microsoft, the bug allowed crafty attackers to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP), an HTTP header that restricts external resources loaded and run on the web page.\n  In a proof-of-concept, Kokatsu showed that if a web application creates a  Blob URL with attacker-controlled data, it could lead to XSS attacks \u2013 even if the site is protected with strict CSP policies. Blobs are raw data that can be read as text or streams.\n Due to the way iframes (embedded HTML pages) inherit headers and policies from their parent page, an attacker could exploit the bug to bypass the CSP rules and execute malicious code on the page.\n    For example, a recent  XSS vulnerability in chat.mozilla.org occurred due to creating a Blob URL from a Blob object passed by an attacker.\n \u201cThis XSS could have been still exploitable even if they had CSP,\u201d Kokatsu told  The Daily Swig in written comments.\n Kokatsu also said that the attack could be staged on other URL schemes, including  data: and  javascript: URLs.\n  Kokatsu discovered the bug in December 2018. It was  initially dismissed as something of a non-issue, but the Chromium team later acknowledged its severity and implemented new container security policies in the Chromium specification.\n \u201cNot many people realize that cross-origin pages can navigate iframes or windows opened by them,\u201d Kokatsu said. \u201cThis understanding is required to understand the attack, and the problem space of policy inheritance issues in the CSP\u2019s specification.\u201d\n Nonetheless, due to its complexity, it took more than two years to get the bug fixed. \u201cCSP needs to  inherit policy to  local scheme, because those schemes (e.g.,  about:,  blob:,  data:,  javascript:) don\u2019t have response headers,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n    While some of the schemes were relatively easy to solve, Blob URLs were especially difficult to patch because it\u2019s hard to track which document created the URL.\n \u201cTherefore, they had to make a new concept in HTML\u2019s specification to track this information,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n The new HTML specification,  Policy Container, provides more granular control over the policies inherited across HTML documents and their embedded components. It currently applies to CSP and Referrer Policy only. Kokatsu says it needs to be applied to other policies as well.\n  Using iframes has been fraught with security concerns. \u201cThe ability to link other pages or frame other pages has been one of the benefits of the web. However, it does add complexity to the ecosystem both from browser security and web security,\u201d Kokatsu said.\n Browser vendors are constantly trying to develop new specifications and tools to mitigate attacks through embedded frames.

Someone has previously stated that it might be an   Easter egg.\n In API 21 the implementation was changed to check if there is an installed app with the package  com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator\n /** * Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to * teleportations. * * &lt;p&gt;As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method can * now automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt; * * @return Returns true if the user making this call is a goat. */public boolean isUserAGoat() { return mContext.getPackageManager() .isPackageAvailable(&#34;com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator&#34;);}\n  15  Theory: Goats are found in all kinds of precarious places, like sheer cliffs, possibly bucking location trends they get from regular non-goat users. Might explain &#34;teleportations&#34;, which could be goats appearing to wildly relocate as the software tries to determine their location with algos designed for non-goats.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 tedders\n  This is a history lesson, not an answer. Even if it is an Easter egg, is there a valid use case for it? Being an Easter egg doesn&#39;t preclude it from being useful, and you&#39;ve not shown whether it is or is not useful.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 casperOne\n    I feel bad for anyone who cheekily used this function, expecting it to return  false forever.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Martin Konecny\n  @raulk Yes, they used the ID of that app, they didn&#39;t pick a random app ID and then happen to have someone create an app with that ID...\r \r\u2013\u00a0 user253751\n      I don&#39;t know if this was &#34;the&#34; official use case, but the following produces a warning in Java (that can further produce compile errors if mixed with  return statements, leading to unreachable code):\n    So I often find myself writing a silly utility method for the quickest way to dummy out a code block, then in completing debugging find all calls to it, so provided the implementation doesn&#39;t change this can be used for that.\n JLS points out  if (false) does not trigger &#34;unreachable code&#34; for the specific reason that this would break support for debug flags, i.e., basically this use case (h/t @auselen). ( static final boolean DEBUG = false; for instance).\n I replaced  while for  if, producing a more obscure use case. I  believe you can trip up your IDE, like Eclipse, with this behavior, but this edit is 4 years into the future, and I don&#39;t have an Eclipse environment to play with.\n  12  @djechlin I do not know if this is android only, in standard java ` if(false){...}` compiles just fine (open jdk javac 1.6 and 1.7)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 josefx\n  @PeterOlson - if you are specifically trying to test a code branch where an if goes false or true, this is the most precise and obvious way to simulate that - commenting out the block could be less accurate if you don&#39;t match to the proper end of the block (perhaps you didn&#39;t notice a discreet if/else block immediately following), it will lead to a compile error if you&#39;re forcing to the following  else block, etc.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 djechlin\n  &#34;provided the implementation doesn&#39;t change&#34; - and there&#39;s the problem. This is a disastrous way to implement a warning-free &#34;if (false)&#34; because the implementation can and does change. See my answer to this question: as of API21  isUserAGoat() returns true if a user has a specific app installed. Good luck diagnosing that when your code suddenly starts behaving oddly on &#34;random&#34; devices!\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Mark Whitaker\n    @thedayturns If goats start using Android devices this will be the least of our problems.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Szymon Drosdzol\n    This appears to be an inside joke at Google. It&#39;s also featured in the Google Chrome task manager. It has no purpose, other than some engineers finding it amusing. Which is a purpose by itself, if you will.\n     int TaskManagerModel::GetGoatsTeleported(int index) const { int seed = goat_salt_ * (index + 1); return (seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255;}\n  14  i don&#39;t have it, where do you right click? or what it is used for\r \r\u2013\u00a0 auselen\n  @auselen You have to right click on a column title in order to see the drop down menu to add the Goats Teleported column (at least that&#39;s how it works in Chrome on OS X).  cl.ly/Ksbd\r \r\u2013\u00a0 greenie\n  Windows XP + latest Chrome = it isn&#39;t there, on Ubuntu I see it.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 auselen\n  @Xeoncross Yes because nobody has put an easter egg in Windows software, ever.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Mark Allen\n      Complementing the @djechlin  answer (good answer by the way!), this function call could be  also used as dummy code to hold a breakpoint in an IDE when you want to stop in some specific iteration or a particular recursive call, for example:\n  isUserAGoat() could be used instead of a dummy variable declaration that will be shown in the IDE as a warning and, in Eclipse particular case, will clog the breakpoint mark, making it difficult to enable/disable it. If the method is used as a convention, all the invocations could be later filtered by some script (during commit phase maybe?).\n  Google guys are heavy Eclipse users (they provide several of their projects as Eclipse plugins: Android SDK, GAE, etc), so the @djechlin answer and this complementary answer make a lot of sense (at least for me).\n  8  If you are writing &#34;dummy&#34; code just to quickly test something, what is the problem with an Eclipse warning?? I think this is actually great as you can find it in case you&#39;ve forgotten\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Tomasz\n  @Tomasz the problem is that, in Eclipse, the warning mark clutters the breakpoint, and you have to open the breakpoint view to either deactivate or remove it\r \r\u2013\u00a0 higuaro\n  Yeah, I have a solution for that. You can right click on the warning symbol and select &#34;Toggle Breakpoint&#34;. If the following line/option is enabled it means the breakpoint is created. My point was, dummy code is bad and it should be a warning so yo don&#39;t forget ;)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Tomasz\n  @Tomasz The problem with that solution is that you have know beforehand where the breakpoint is, so a simple visual inspection won&#39;t let you know that the warning hides a breakpoint, an even better solution though, is to use conditional breakpoints, with them you can forget about dummy code (and convention methods) altogether, but those differ between IDE&#39;s and can&#39;t be automatically shared among workstations\r \r\u2013\u00a0 higuaro\n  Why not just use a null statement  ;? I mean, goats are clearly better, but there is an easy way around this already\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Bassinator\n    The only practical use I ever saw was in the Last Call for  Google I/O Contest where they asked what it was for a particular version, to see if contestants read the API diff report for each release. The contest had programming problems too, but generally some trivia that could be graded automatically first to get the number of submissions down to reasonable amounts that would be easier to check.\n  7  &#34;There&#39;s a funny named method/constant/whatever in each version of Android.&#34; Could you name some?\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Angelo.Hannes\n  For example, there are a nivel of log called Log.wtf that they call What a Terrible Failure :P\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Aracem\n      @Angelo.Hannes, In the Sensor Constants for Gravity there&#39;s one for Death Star (Star Wars)\r \r\u2013\u00a0 st0le\n    Sheeps are people for whom speech recognition works exceptionally well, and goats are people for whom it works exceptionally poorly. Only the voice recognizer knows what separates them. People can&#39;t predict whose voice will be recognized easily and whose won&#39;t. The best policy is to design the interface so it can handle all kinds of voices in all kinds of environments\n Maybe, it is planned to mark Android users as goats in the future to be able to configure the speech recognition engine for goats&#39; needs. ;-)\n  0\n    As of API 21 (the first Android 5.0/Lollipop SDK), this detects whether the  Goat Simulator app is installed:\n /** * Used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to * teleportations. * * &lt;p&gt;As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#LOLLIPOP}, this method can * now automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology.&lt;/p&gt; * * @return Returns true if the user making this call is a goat. */public boolean isUserAGoat() { return mContext.getPackageManager() .isPackageAvailable(&#34;com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator&#34;);}\n This should make it clear that  djechlin&#39;s suggestion of using it as a warning-free  if (false) is a potentially disastrous strategy. What previously returned  false for every device now returns a seemingly random value: if this was buried deep enough in your code it could take a  long time to figure out where your new bugs are coming from.\n Bottom line: if you don&#39;t control the implementation of a method and decide to use it for purposes other than stated in the API documentation, you&#39;re heading for trouble.\n  2  Why would anyone ever put any kind of  if(false) in production? Come on here. If that&#39;s what your code looks like then this implementation changing is the  least of your problems.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 djechlin\n  @djechlin &#34;do we need this feature?  changes to if(false),  tests feature nope.  checks in&#34;\r \r\u2013\u00a0 user253751\n    Google has a serious liking for goats and goat based  Easter eggs. There has even been  previous Stack\u00a0Overflow posts about it.\n As has been mentioned in previous posts, it also exists within the Chrome task manager ( it first appeared in the wild in 2009):\n  And then in Windows, Linux and Mac versions of Chrome early 2010). The number of &#34;Goats Teleported&#34; is in fact  random:\n int TaskManagerModel::GetGoatsTeleported(int index) const { int seed = goat_salt_ * (index + 1); return (seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 255; }\n   The earliest correlation of goats and Google belongs in the original &#34;Mowing with goats&#34; blog post, as far as I can tell.\n We can safely assume that it&#39;s merely an Easter egg and has no real-world use, except for returning  false.\n  1\n    There is a similar call,  isUserAMonkey(), that returns true if the  MonkeyRunner tool is being used. The SDK explanation is just as curious as this one.\n   I expect that this was added in anticipation of a new  SDK tool named something with a goat and will  actually be functional to test for the presence of that tool.\n  1  My assumption with this one is it allows the  ActivityManager to report if it has been invoked by the  monkey ui stress testing tool, but i have never confirmed this.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 CtrlF\n    Funny Easter Egg.  In Ubuntu version of Chrome, in Task Manager ( shift+ esc), with right-click you can add a sci-fi column that in italian version is &#34;Capre Teletrasportate&#34; (Teleported Goats).\n  0\n    If you have Goat Simulator installed, you&#39;re a goat.If you don&#39;t have it installed, you&#39;re not a goat.\n I imagine it was more of a personal experiment by one of the developers, most likely to find people with a common interest.\n  2  The method was created before the goat simulator. Although it checks if the app is installed now, it didn&#39;t do anything before. And it&#39;s a joke anyway.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 Ricardo A.\n  Google Chrome&#39;s tab monitor had an easter egg column \u00abgoats teleported\u00bb (and  isUserAGoat docs refers to goats teleportation too. So it&#39;s definitely an internal joke.\r \r\u2013\u00a0 artem\n    Not the answer you&#39;re looking for?

", "note_en": "Five-year-olds are suffering panic attacks about meeting their friends, NHS leaders have said, amid warnings  1.5 million children will need mental health treatment in the wake of repeated lockdowns.\n Experts said young children had become increasingly anxious, with some fearful of leaving their homes, amid an explosion in \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d across the country.\n Waits of up to four years for help on the NHS have forced a growing number of families to seek help from private psychologists - only to find that they are oversubscribed and unable to take on more patients, a Telegraph investigation reveals.\n Leading private therapists said they are taking twice the normal level of calls from worried parents, forcing them to turn away patients, or open waiting lists for the first time in their careers.\n  Experts said many children were  suffering behavioural problems fuelled by lockdowns, social distancing and fear of infection, with many now anxious about everyday social activities.\n Forecasts seen by this newspaper state that an extra 1.5 million children and young people will require mental health support \u201cas a direct impact of the pandemic\u201d during the next three to five years. \u00a0The calculations from the Centre for Mental Health, involving NHS economists, suggest demand will be as much as three times greater than the capacity of mental health services.\n Dame Rachel De Souza, Children&#39;s Commissioner for England, said a survey of more than 550,000 children - the largest such poll in history - will show mental health to be the greatest concern of this generation of children.\n She said her visits across the country, as part of a forthcoming commission, had found children suffering \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d and struggling to adjust to changes to their lives since the pandemic.\n At a meeting run by the NHS Confederation, a number of health officials said they were struggling to find help for their own children, who had become increasingly disturbed since the first lockdown.\n One senior figure said: \u201cMy five-year-old is housebound because she&#39;s too scared to go away from the house, never mind to school. No one can even refer me to someone privately as they don&#39;t know of any local child psychotherapists who will see someone of her age.\u201d\n Another told how her young daughter, now undergoing counselling, had a panic attack about going on a \u201cplay date\u201d, after a year of enforced lockdowns and social distancing.\n  Dame Rachel told the meeting: \u201cI\u2019ve been around the country and seen those sad little faces \u2026 putting their arms around their friends as they tell me about having their trauma from losing a grandparent, not being able to go to a funeral. Coming out of lockdown and not knowing how to make friends anymore, not knowing how to talk to anyone else,\u201d she said.\n \u201cEveryone is on edge,\u201d she said, warning of a \u201clocked-in trauma\u201d affecting swathes of young people, at the session last week.\n The UK\u2019s largest private mental health partnership, Clinical Partners, is now holding 85 per cent more private appointments for children than in 2019.\n Before Covid struck, most private child mental health experts were typically able to fit in patients for a first appointment within one or two weeks. But the pandemic has caused a surge in mental health problems in young people, with one in six under-18s now thought to have a diagnosable condition, such as anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder or eating disorders.\n The rise in demand has heaped pressures on the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, with waiting lists for a first appointment as long as four years in some areas.\n During the 12 months since the first lockdown, 420,504 children and young people have received NHS treatment for mental health problems, an 11 per cent rise in two years.\n  Child psychologist Maryhan Baker has seen demand for her services double in recent months, with average waiting times jumping from two weeks to nearly four months.\n \u201cI\u2019m working longer hours and more evenings to fit more people in but the demand is beyond my own individual capability,\u201d she said.\n  She said many parents who approached her for help had been warned by GPs \u201cnot to bother\u201d waiting for an NHS appointment.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. There are a lot of children who were maybe just a bit anxious before the pandemic presenting now with compulsions, eating disorders, self-harm and other control behaviours,\u201d she said.\n Consultant psychologist Dr Elena Touroni said waiting times for children\u2019s services at her practice, The Chelsea Psychology Clinic, had grown by at least 50 per cent.\n On Tuesday, NHS England will promise an extra \u00a340m for children\u2019s mental health services.\n NHS England director for mental health Claire Murdoch said: \u201cThe pandemic has turned young people\u2019s lives upside down, and while in some areas of the country staff are now treating more young people than ever before, the NHS has worked with schools and other local agencies to ensure early intervention and support, including through 183 mental health support teams working with schools across the country.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 00:15:31", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6050\u614c,olds,\u513f\u7ae5", "title": "\u4e94\u5c81\u7684\u5b69\u5b50'\u6050\u614c\u88ad\u51fb\u4e0e\u670b\u53cb\u4ea4\u5f80\u793e\u4ea4 ", "title_en": "Five year olds 'having panic attacks over socializing with their friends'", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/21/five-year-olds-having-panic-attacks-social-contact-say-experts/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6050\u614c", "olds", "\u513f\u7ae5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8946844b86a269c3fac6d95001a13baf.jpg", "infoid": 1067475, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u641c\u7d22Quake\u662f\u7531ID\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u5c04\u51fb\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7531GT Internactive\u4e8e1996\u5e74\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u5b83\u662fQuake\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u3002 [5]\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73a9\u5bb6\u5fc5\u987b\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u79cd\u8ff7\u5bab\u822c\u7684\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6765\u627e\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6b66\u5668\u4f5c\u51fa\u5404\u79cd\u602a\u7269\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6c1b\u56f4\u662f\u9ed1\u6697\u548c\u575a\u97e7\u7684\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u77f3\u6750\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u751f\u9508\u7684\uff0c\u5927\u5199\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\n ID\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7ee7\u627f\u8005\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Quake is a  first-person shooter  video game developed by  id Software and published by  GT Interactive in  1996. It is the first game in the   Quake series.  [5] In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry. The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with many stone  textures and a rusty, capitalized  font.\n The successor to id Software&#39;s   Doom series,  Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.  [6] Unlike the   Doom engine before it, the   Quake engine offered full  real-time 3D rendering and had early support for  3D acceleration through  OpenGL. After   Doom helped to popularize  multiplayer  deathmatches in 1993,  Quake added various multiplayer options.  Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the  QuakeWorld update and software such as  QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n     In  Quake &#39;s single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, &#34;Nightmare&#34;, was &#34;so bad that it was hidden, so people won&#39;t wander in by accident&#34;;  [7] the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n Quake &#39;s single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a &#34;low gravity&#34; level that challenges the player&#39;s abilities in a different way). If the player&#39;s character dies, he must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub &#34;START&#34; level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of  Quake) has the most traditional ideology of a  boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the &#34;END&#34; level which contains a final puzzle.\n  In multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player&#39;s computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in  co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of  deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either  free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one  duels, or organized  teamplay with two or more players per team (or  clan). Players frequently implement  mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n The gameplay in  Quake was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.  [8]  Bunny hopping or strafe jumping allow faster movement, while  rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to  Quake &#39;s appeal. Multiplayer  Quake was one of the first games singled out as a form of  electronic sport.  [9] A notable participant was  Dennis Fong, who won  John Carmack&#39;s  Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored  Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.\n  In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the unnamed protagonist called Ranger in later games (voiced by  Trent Reznor)  [10] who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy  code-named &#34;Quake&#34;. The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a &#34;Slipgate&#34;; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the &#34;Human&#34; dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n The sole surviving protagonist in &#34;Operation Counterstrike&#34; is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger&#39;s main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\n The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or &#34;maps&#34;, divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game&#39;s final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of  gothic,  medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of  Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game&#39;s setting is inspired by  dark fantasy influences, including  H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s  Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the &#34;Spawn&#34; enemies are called &#34;Formless Spawn of  Tsathoggua&#34; in the manual, the  boss of the first episode is named  Chthon, and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a  Dark Young). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and  The Nameless City. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n    A preview included with  id&#39;s very first release, 1990&#39;s   Commander Keen, advertised a game entitled  The Fight for Justice as a follow-up to the  Commander Keen trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, &#34;the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent&#34;, armed with thunderbolts and a &#34;Ring of Regeneration&#34;. Conceived as a  VGA full-color  side-scrolling  role-playing game,  The Fight for Justice was never released.\n Lead designer and director  John Romero later conceived of  Quake as an  action game taking place in a fully  3D world, inspired by  Sega AM2&#39;s 3D  fighting game   Virtua Fighter.  Quake was also intended to feature  Virtua Fighter influenced third-person  melee combat, but id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after  Quake was released.  [11]  [12] Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from  Quake.  [13] In 2000, Romero released   Daikatana, the game that he envisioned  Quake being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time,  [14]  [15] he said  Daikatana was &#34;more fun to make than  Quake&#34; due to the lack of creative interference.  [16]\n Quake was given as a title to the game that  id Software was working on shortly after the release of   Doom II. The earliest information released described  Quake as focusing on a  Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer,  [17]  [18]  [19] and is able to knock away enemies by throwing the hammer (complete with real-time  inverse kinematics). [   citation needed] Initially, the levels were supposed to be designed in an  Aztec style, but the choice was dropped some months into the project. [   citation needed] Early screenshots then showed medieval environments and dragons. [   citation needed] The plan was for the game to have more  RPG-style elements. However, work was very slow on the engine, since  John Carmack, the main programmer of  Quake, was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model (Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things). [   citation needed] Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers.  [20]\n Eventually, the whole id Software team began to think that the original concept may not have been as wise a choice as they first believed.  [19] Thus, the final game was very stripped down from its original intentions, and instead featured gameplay similar to  Doom and its sequel, although the levels and enemies were closer to medieval RPG style rather than science-fiction. In a December 1, 1994 post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, &#34;Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say &#34;action&#34;? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout \u2013 probably more so than Doom&#34;.  [21]\n Quake was programmed by John Carmack,  Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by  American McGee,  Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and  Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by  Adrian Carmack,  Kevin Cloud and  Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using  Alias.  [22]\n The  game engine developed for  Quake, the   Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the first-person shooter genre: polygonal models instead of  prerendered  sprites; full 3D level design instead of a  2.5D map;  prerendered  lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with  QuakeC), which popularized fan-created  modifications (mods).\n Before the release of the full game or the shareware version of  Quake, id Software released  QTest on February 24, 1996. It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions.  QTest gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the  Quake engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.  [23]\n Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a  gun-butt.  [19] Shortly before release this was replaced with an  axe.\n   Quake &#39;s music and sound design was done by  Trent Reznor and  Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized  drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the  Quake soundtrack &#34;is not music, it&#39;s textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It&#39;s been fun.&#34;  [24] The game also includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the &#34;Nailgun&#34; and &#34;Super Nailgun&#34; decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.\n Digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original  shareware release.\n  The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor on July 5, 1996,  [3] followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. The first commercially released port was the port to Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port&#39;s release,  [25] leading to MacSoft&#39;s involvement) in late August 1997.  [4] ClickBOOM announced version for  Amiga-computers in 1998.  [26] Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by  Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the three add-ons as  Quake: The Offering.  [27]  [28]  [29]\n Quake was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the  Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself,  [30] but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by  Sega.  [31] Sega then took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent  frame rate, and assigned it to  Lobotomy Software.  [32] The Sega Saturn port used Lobotomy Software&#39;s own 3D game engine,  SlaveDriver (the same game engine that powered the Sega Saturn versions of   PowerSlave and   Duke Nukem 3D), instead of the original  Quake engine.  [33] It is the only version of  Quake that is rated &#34;T&#34; for Teen instead of &#34;M&#34; for Mature.\n Quake had also been ported to the  Sony  PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the port was cancelled due to difficulties in finding a publisher. A port of  Quake for the  Atari Jaguar was also advertized as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of   Ultimate Future Games magazine, but it was never released.  [34]  [35] Another port of  Quake was also slated for  Panasonic M2 but never occurred due to the cancellation of the system.  [36]\n On March 24, 1998, the game was released for the  Nintendo 64 by  Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on   Doom 64,  [37] at id Software&#39;s request.  [38] The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.  [39]\n Both console ports required compromises because of the limited  CPU power and  ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU.  [40] The Sega Saturn version includes 28 of the 32 single-player levels from the original PC version of the game, though the secret levels, Ziggurat Vertigo (E1M8), The Underearth (E2M7), The Haunted Halls (E3M7), and The Nameless City (E4M8), were removed. Instead, it has four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell&#39;s Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, &#34;Dank &amp; Scuz&#34;, which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a  slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Sega Saturn version; as a result of this, all of the deathmatch maps from the PC version were removed from the Sega Saturn port. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto (E1M4), The Installation (E2M1), The Ebon Fortress (E2M4), The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), The Sewage System (E4M1), and Hell&#39;s Atrium (E4M5) levels. It also does not use the hub &#34;START&#34; map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order from The Slipgate Complex (E1M1) to Shub Niggurath&#39;s Pit (END). The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, and an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death, is also included.\n Two ports of  Quake for the Nintendo DS exist,  QuakeDS  [41] and  CQuake.  [42] Both run well, however, multiplayer does not work on  QuakeDS.  [41] Since the source code for  Quake was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones.  [43]  [44]  [45] The  Rockbox project also distributes a version of  Quake that runs on some MP3 players.  [46]\n In 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of  Quake for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions.  [47] Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360.  [48]  Quake mobile was reviewed by  GameSpot on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a  Best Mobile Game&#34; in their E3 2005 Editor&#39;s Choice Awards.  [49] It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v both of which are PDAs not mobile phones.  [49]  Quake Mobile does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints.  [48]  Quake Mobile runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of  Quake Mobile is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two  Quake expansion packs,  Scourge of Armagon and  Dissolution of Eternity, are also available for  Quake Mobile.\n A  Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs  Quake at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.  [50]\n  Quake can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in  QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan created &#34;mods&#34;. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in  Quake fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software&#39;s original release.\n The first major  Quake mod was   Team Fortress. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter  Soldier class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the  Scout class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one&#39;s flag in  Threewave CTF would return the flag to the base, and in  TF the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to  Threewave CTF.  Team Fortress maintained its standing as the most-played online  Quake modification for many years. Team Fortress would go on to become   Team Fortress Classic and get a sequel,   Team Fortress 2.\n Another popular mod was   Threewave  Capture the Flag (CTF), primarily authored by Dave &#39;Zoid&#39; Kirsch.

But I was reminded of it this morning when I saw  a new report on electric vehicle accessibility. Compiled by the Consumer Choice Center (CCC), the report scores all 50 states based on how hard they make it to buy an EV, whether that&#39;s banning direct-to-consumer sales or requiring extra registration fees or  road charges. Unsurprisingly, the United States is a bit of a patchwork in this regard. But it&#39;s not quite as simple as red states making it hard and blue states making it easy to buy an EV.\n  Ten states score top marks with the CCC: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. All these states will allow direct sales of cars to individuals, and none will make you pay more to register your new EV than you&#39;d pay for a new car with an internal combustion engine (ICE). (The District of Columbia would also go in this group if DC-based CCC had included it.)\n California is conspicuous by its absence in that top 10. The state is the leading market for EVs within the US, with  the highest adoption rate and the most public chargers.\u00a0 Nearly half of all US-registered EVs\u00a0are on its roads. But California also has an escalating EV license fee that&#39;s currently $100 but is now linked to the consumer price index.\n Because it&#39;s possible to register some gasoline-powered vehicles in California for less than $100, the state joins the &#34;somewhat accessible&#34; group, along with Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Most of those states, like California, lost points because they have extra EV registration fees, but Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all have some restrictions on automakers selling cars directly to the public.\n The &#34;barely accessible&#34; states were Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. A few of these states prohibit direct auto sales but don&#39;t charge more to register an EV than an ICE vehicle, others allow Tesla (but no other automaker) to sell direct to the public, and some do both.\n  Finally, there are the inaccessible states: Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Each of these place plenty of roadblocks between their citizens and a new EV, banning any direct sales within their borders as well as making it more expensive to register an EV than an ICE vehicle.\n  In total, 28 states make it more expensive to register an EV, and 17 have completely banned Tesla and others from selling their cars straight to the public. Twelve other states have some restrictions on direct sales, including allowing Tesla (but no other automaker) to make them.\n &#34;It is clear that consumers want more access to electric vehicles. Therefore legislation should make the purchase and ownership of them as convenient as possible, and we urge legislators to put forth better policies that will reduce the significant barriers currently preventing consumers from fully\u00a0accessing EVs,&#34; said CCC&#39;s North American affairs manager David Clement, co-author of the study.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:37:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8d2d\u4e70,states,ev", "title": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u76849\u4e2a\u6700\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6 ", "title_en": "These are the 9 worst states to buy an electric car in", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/06/these-are-the-9-worst-states-to-buy-an-electric-car-in/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8d2d\u4e70", "states", "ev"]}]
