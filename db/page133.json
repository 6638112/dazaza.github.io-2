That allowed the startup to allow dozens of smaller investors to take part in this funding event, including 28 micro-checks that it rolled into a single cap-table line-item thanks to an AngelList service that allows for smaller investments to be combined.\n Arrows sells to software CEOs and heads of customer success, the people who care the most about ensuring that new customers get up and running with new digital products as quickly as possible. Per Zarick, successful customer onboarding to a new product or service can speed up adoption, helping boost revenue from usage-based products; it\u2019s also generally known that stronger onboarding can also lead to better adoption inside of customer organizations, potentially limiting later churn.\n  Given the scale of the modern software market, Arrows is selling into fertile ground. That\u2019s the reason that Zarick and his co-founder Benedict Fritz decided to stop being a two-person shop, and raise more capital. They were worried, Zarick explained, about suffocating their company without more capital.\n  Luckily for Arrows, one investor had already taken a keen eye to their work. Namely Gradient Ventures\u2019  Darian Shirazi, who had reached out a number of times before the startup was even considering raising external funds. Per the Arrows CEO, Shirazi had already sent the startup his own portfolio companies as leads before he invested, some of whom have become customers. So, when Zarick and Fritz decided to pursue venture capital, there was a leading name already on hand.\n The $2.75 million round was raised using a SAFE at a single cap, sans discount.\n  Arrows initially  launched its service in March, but is revamping its pricing this week, closing its self-serve model for the near-term.\n It\u2019s interesting to listen to the CEO of a seed-stage startup discuss evolving from a bootstrapped model to one backed by a good-sized amount of venture funding. Zarick described to TechCrunch in an interview how much his job was changing now that the company is working to scale up to a team of around eight. The company intends to stay at that human scale for a little while.\n Per its CEO, Arrows can get along for two years with its current capital sans revenue growth; though we\u2019d expect that now that it has attracted seed capital, other VCs will look to pile on \u2014 a trend that we\u2019ve seen often in recent weeks and months.\n The Arrows product is also going to evolve in the coming months. While attacking customer onboarding teams\u2019 use of spreadsheets with modern software has worked thus far, the startup has lots of planned work ahead of it, including more integrations with external software. Let\u2019s see how quickly we hear from Arrows again. I\u2019ll wager anyone a high-five that it\u2019s before the end of the year.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:46:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

sellers find new customers, and it wants to do so with a spirit of collaboration at a discount. The startup announced a $5.8 million round today that closed earlier this month, evidence that it has found backers for its model that has already collected 500 brands.\n That final figure matters because co-op is an almost uniquely collaborative company. Brands that sign up to be part of co-op include its technology on their post-purchase page, allowing for other, related items to be shown to customers who just finished buying something. By including the widget, a company\u2019s product will be shown on the post-purchase page of another company.\n That sounds anti-capitalist at the very least, which wouldn\u2019t work in a venture-backed world. So, what\u2019s the twist? The post-purchase page widget shows three or four products, giving it extra inventory that it can sell to its partnered brands. Presto, revenue.\n The company\u2019s founder and CEO,  Conner Sherline, told TechCrunch that his startup can deliver advertising space at around half the cost-per-action of Facebook and other channels; how the economics of its model scale as more brands join will be fascinating to watch.\n The startup also offers software tooling, including a post-purchase survey feature that costs 5 cents per order for customers to leverage.\n Sherline\u2019s startup appears to be growing quickly. When it raised pre-seed capital last July, it had around 20 brands onboarded to its service. Today, the company is adding another 50 to 100 each month. At that rate, it could reach 1,000 brands in total by the end of the year, barring any deceleration in its ability to attract new brands to its network.\n The startup\u2019s early progress attracted  Sugar Capital to lead its latest round, which also saw participation from  Bessemer Venture Partners and online e-commerce giant Shopify. The Shopify check is interesting; co-op already  exists on the Shopify app store, for example. TechCrunch will keep an eye out for more integrations between the two companies, something that could turbo-charge the startup\u2019s growth.\n There are a number of places for co-op to expand into. Sherline told TechCrunch in an interview that its collaborative network is the first thing that the company is working on. But with lots of sales data and a wealth of partners, co-op could build out partner networks aimed at other parts of the e-commerce sales life cycle pretty easily, we reckon.\n Regardless, the company now has a multiple of the $1.6 million that it had raised before. Let\u2019s see how quickly it can scale its brand base with the new funds.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:45:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "op,merchants",

", "note_en": "This feature isn\u2019t available to all Alexa device owners, as it requires an  Amazon Kids+ subscription. This is the $2.99 per month subscription service that also provides families with children access to thousands of kid-friendly books, TV shows, movies, educational apps and games, in addition to premium content for Echo devices, like ad-free radio stations and playlists, Audible books, and exclusive Alexa skills.\n   Once subscribed, the child can then direct Alexa to read with them and they\u2019ll pick up a compatible book or ebook to get started. Alexa will ask what book they\u2019re reading and how much does the child want to read: a lot, a little, or taking turns? The feature works with the hundreds of children\u2019s books for ages 6 to 9 that are included as part of the Amazon Kids+ subscription, including both the print or digital versions. When it\u2019s the child\u2019s turn reading. Alexa will listen and provide encouragement when the child is doing well, and will offer support when the child is struggling.\n Meanwhile, support for new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids will also begin rolling out, starting today. This opt-in feature allows parents or guardians to create a voice profile for each child in their family (up to 4 kids). When enabled, the Alexa experience will be personalized to the individual speaking. That means Alexa will automatically apply the appropriate parental controls that have been configured, automatically filter explicit music, limit calls and messages sent through Alexa only to approved contacts, and restrict the child only to the Alexa skills parents have pre-approved. Alexa will also provide the child with access to kid-friendly games, skills, music, and videos and will provide kid-friendly responses to kids\u2019 inquiries.\n While features like these can make the Alexa experience more fun and useful for families, parents have to weigh their comfort with having their children\u2019s voices recorded and analyzed and determine how long they would want such recordings stored. Today, Amazon uses kids\u2019 voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems in order to improve Alexa\u2019s ability to understand children\u2019s questions and requests. In some number of cases, these recordings are also manually reviewed. Parents who don\u2019t want to participate can delete recordings associated with their child\u2019s history either one-by-one or all at once via the Alexa app Settings. They can also set recordings to automatically delete on an ongoing 3-month or 18-month basis and can delete recordings via voice requests.\n However, if the parent chooses not to save the child\u2019s recordings, they\u2019ll not be able to go back through the history to see the requests their child has made over time from the  Parent Dashboard.\n Every parent will need to make a decision about what\u2019s right for their own household before enabling features like Reading Sidekick or Voice Profiles, or, more broadly about whether they want to bring a smart speaker of any kind into their home.\n Amazon says the new Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids should reach all Amazon customers by Friday, July 2.

A wealth of research led the company to understand that certain plant-based foods and molecules, when fed to the bees, can reduce the mortality rate of bees by up to 70 percent, and help them perform better in colder weather.\n   Bees are the planet\u2019s natural pollinators. They turn flowers into fruit, spreading pollen from one landing spot to another. Many farmers will \u2018rent out\u2019 bees from beekeepers to hang out on their farms and pollinate their plants. In almost every way, the effectiveness of this can\u2019t be measured, and the bees themselves can\u2019t truly be controlled.\n Beeflow\u2019s technology ensures that the bees are healthy and strong, and can fly up to 7x more during colder weather than they\u2019d be able to without it. This means that those bees are much more likely to effectively and efficiently pollinate crops for the farmers.\n Beyond reducing the mortality rate of bees, the company also offers a second product called ToBEE, which trains the bees to target a specific crop, such as blueberries or almonds.\n  Beeflow\u2019s business model is two-fold. They have their own bees that they loan out to farmers for pollination, and also work with beekeepers to bring them into the Beeflow network. Bee keepers do not pay for Beeflow\u2019s technology, but do hand over the rights to their relationships with farmers.\n The startup was founded by Matias Viel, who is from Argentina, and is mostly operational in Latin America and the West Coast of the U.S., with plans to expand to the East Coast and Mexico.\n \u201cThe greatest challenge is operational and around execution,\u201d said Viel. \u201cThere is so much demand and we need to scale our team and our operations now.\u201d\n The financing round was led by Ospraie Ag Science, with participation from Future Ventures\u2019 Steve Jurvetson, Jeff Wilke, Vectr Ventures, SOSV\u2019s IndieBio and Grid Exponential.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:45:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u871c\u8702,save", "title": "Beeflow\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86830\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u62ef\u6551\u871c\u8702\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u653e\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBeeflow raises $8.3 million to save the bees AND put them to work\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/beeflow-raises-8-3-million-to-save-the-bees-and-put-them-to-work/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u871c\u8702", "save"]}]
