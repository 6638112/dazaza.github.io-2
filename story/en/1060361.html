This harm was more than the sum of its parts.</p><p> 作为网络处理STS允许我们了解运动中的协调以及在网络级别的危害如何持久。这种危害超过了部分的总和。</p><p>  We learned a lot from these cases.

The satisfaction at having made it past the election without major incident was tempered by the rise in angry vitriol and a slew of conspiracy theories that began to steadily grow. At the time, veterans of 2016 recalled the spike in fear, anger, and uncertainty, the growth of mega-groups like Pantsuit Nation. We all asked ourselves whether what we were seeing in the wake of the election was the same thing, or something more nefarious. Hindsight is 20/20, at the time it was very difficult to know whether what we were seeing was a coordinated effort to delegitimize the election, or whether it was protected free expression by users who were afraid and confused and deserved our empathy. But hindsight being 20/20 makes it all the more important to look back to learn what we can about the growth of the election delegitimizing movements that grew, spread conspiracy, and helped incite the Capitol Insurrection.</p><p>  我们中的许多人都记得选举晚上和几天后。在没有重大事件的情况下使其在没有重大事件的选举中的满意度被愤怒的硫酸升起的升温，并且开始稳步增长的阴谋理论。当时，2016年退伍军人回忆起恐惧，愤怒和不确定性的飙升，梅尔巴群岛等泳装国家的增长。我们都要求自己在选举后我们看到的是同样的事情，或者更令人邪恶的东西。后见证是20/20，当时很难知道我们看到的是德定选举的协调努力，还是被害怕和困惑的用户受到保护的自由表达，并应得的同理心。但是，后代是20/20的内容使其更重要的是回顾学到我们所能的大选委员会增长，传播阴谋和帮助煽动国会叛乱的流动。</p><p> The first Stop the Steal Group emerged on election night. It was flagged for escalation because it contained high levels of hate and violence and incitement (VNI) in the comments. The Group was disabled, and an investigation was kicked off, looking for early signs of coordination and harm across the new Stop the Steal Groups that were quickly sprouting up to replace it. With our early signals, it was unclear that coordination was taking place, or that there was enough harm to constitute designating the term. It wasn’t until later that it became clear just how much of a focal point the catchphrase would be, and that they would serve as a rallying point around which a movement of violent election delegitimization could coalesce.</p><p> 第一次停止窃取集团在选举之夜出现。它被标记为升级，因为它在评论中包含了高水平的仇恨和暴力和煽动（VNI）。该小组被禁用，调查被启动，寻找早期的协调和伤害新的停止，偷窃群体正在迅速发芽以取代它。通过我们的早期信号，目前还不清楚协调正在发生，或者危害足以构成指定术语。直到晚些时候，它变得清楚地达到了传统的焦点，并且他们将作为一个围绕着恐怖派会的集会点，这是暴力选举表达的运动可以聚结。</p><p> “Delegitimization” (D14N) as a concept is new territory, both for analysis and policy. Many D14N workstreams were spun up in the wake of election night, but few policies or knowledge existed around the issue. Our research during the US2020 IPOC came from rapid work on topic classifiers, CIRD pipelines, regex and classifier tracking in HELLCAT, and manual analysis via CORGI modeling, and we were able to launch demotions and some enforcement directed at the issue, but work remains to develop a firm policy framework around addressing the issue. In this note we will describe the harms we were later able to observe within the StS movement, how follow-on movements like Patriot Party (PP) were able to grow in its wake, and how we might use what we learned to better capture coordinated harm in the future.</p><p> 作为一个概念的“DEGITIMIZATION”（D14N）是用于分析和政策的新领域。在选举之夜之后，许多D14N工作流迅速，但问题周围存在很少的政策或知识。我们在US2020 IPOC期间的研究来自Hellcat中的主题分类器，CIRD管道，正则表达式和分类器跟踪的快速工作，以及通过Corgi建模的手动分析，我们能够在问题上发出降级和一些执法，但工作仍然存在制定解决问题的坚定政策框架。在本说明书中，我们将描述我们以后能够在STS运动中观察的危害，如爱国者派对（PP）如何在其唤醒中发展，以及我们如何利用我们学到的知识来更好地捕获协调损害未来。 </p><p>  From the earliest Groups, we saw high levels of Hate, VNI, and delegitimization, combined with meteoric growth rates — almost all of the fastest growing FB Groups were Stop the Steal during their peak growth. Because we were looking at each entity individually, rather than as a cohesive movement, we were only able to take down individual Groups and Pages once they exceeded a violation threshold. We were not able to act on simple objects like posts and comments because they individually tended not to violate, even if they were surrounded by hate, violence, and misinformation. After the Capitol Insurrection and a wave of Storm the Capitol events across the country, we realized that the individual delegitimizing Groups, Pages, and slogans did constitute a cohesive movement.</p><p>从最早的群体中，我们看到了高水平的仇恨，VNI和德格明，结合了陨石增长率 - 几乎所有增长的FB组群体都在峰值增长期间停止偷窃。因为我们单独看待每个实体，而不是作为一个凝聚力的运动，一旦超过违规门槛，我们只能取消单个群体和页面。我们不能像帖子和评论一样行事，因为他们单独往往不违反侵犯，即使它们被仇恨，暴力和错误信息包围。在国会议会起义和一股风暴浪潮中全国各地的国会大厦事件，我们意识到个人德格尼亚，页面和口号确实构成了一个有凝聚力的运动。</p><p> Some of our first indicators use off-platform signals, finding that designated organized hate groups were involved in organizing Storm the Capitol (StC) events using CORGI fanouts, and were involved in pushing Stop the Steal. We also found that there was high membership overlap between StS Groups and Proud Boy (a designated DOI org) and militia Groups.</p><p> 我们的一些第一个指标使用离线信号，发现指定有组织的仇恨团体参与组织风暴的国会大厦（STC）事件使用Corgi Fanouts，并参与推动偷窃。我们还发现，STS团体和骄傲的男孩（指定的Doi Org）和民兵群体之间存在高会员资格重叠。</p><p> We looked at the content of Groups and Pages, comparing the rates of hate speech, vni, and DOI references in StS, PP, and StC Groups using the HELLCAT tables, which aggregate a myriad of integrity-based content signals to the complex entity level. This allowed us to see that StS groups had considerably more hate, vni, and references to conspiracy and militias than the average civic Group as a whole.</p><p> 我们研究了组和页面的内容，使用Hellcat表比较了STS，PP和STC组中STS，PP和STC组中的仇恨语音，VNI和DOI引用的速率，该表将基于Integrity的内容信号聚合到复杂的实体级别。这让我们可以看到STS团体大大仇恨，VNI，以及与整个普通公民组织的阴谋和民兵的参考。</p><p> In addition to HELLCAT, we were built fast turnaround classifiers and CIRD pipelines to identify high risk Groups and other complex entities. These CIRD pipelines were wired to demotions, as well as aggregated to surface high risk complex entities. Misinfo escalations were also frequent, although the volume far outstripped 3PFC or escalation review capacity. Together, these approaches allowed us to flag individual Groups and Events with high levels of harm for review through HEROCO or the Events queue.</p><p> 除了HELCAT外，我们还建立了快速的周转准分机和CIRD管道，以识别高风险群体和其他复杂实体。这些CIRD管道被连接到降级，以及聚集到表面高风险复杂实体。 MISINFO升级也经常频繁，尽管体积远远超过3PFC或升级审查能力。这些方法在一起使我们能够通过Heroco或事件队列来审查高度伤害的个人团体和事件。</p><p>    These content-based approaches allowed us to observe how harm manifested in the movement as a whole, showing that the terms were steeped in hate and VNI. This helped us see that there was a problem, but network analysis helped us understand coordination in the movement, and how the harm was able to spread as a network. Understanding the growth of the network will help us to better tackle harmful networks in the future.</p><p>    这些基于内容的方法使我们能够观察整个运动中表现出的危害，表明这些术语沉浸在仇恨和VNI中。这有助于我们看到存在问题，但网络分析帮助我们了解运动中的协调，以及如何将危害作为网络传播。了解网络的增长将有助于我们将来更好地解决有害网络。</p><p>  We were able to observe direct coordination for Stop the Steal through investigative work, relying on external sources for leads.</p><p>  我们能够遵守通过调查工作阻止偷窃的直接协调，依靠外部来源进行领导。</p><p> The terms Stop the Steal and Patriot Party were amplified both on platform and off. Ali Alexander and the Kremer sisters repeated slogans at rallies, and spread them through super Groups like Women4Trump and Latinos for Trump. The Kremer Sisters were admins of both Women4Trump, and the original Stop the Steal Group. After January 6th, Amy Kremer confirmed on platform that she was an organizer for the Stop the Steal rally that precipitated the Capitol Insurrection.</p><p> 术语停止窃取，爱国者在平台和关闭时被放大。 Ali Alexander和Kremer姐妹在集会中重复了口号，并通过女性4Trump和Lauinos的超级群体传播它们，为特朗普。克雷梅勒姐妹都是女性4Trump的管理员，而原来则停止窃取组。 1月6日之后，艾米克雷梅勒在平台上确认，她是一个辍学戒断的偷窃团结的组织者。 </p><p> Ali Alexander worked on and off platform, using media appearances and celebrity endorsements. We also observed him formally organizing with others to spread the term, including with other users who had ties to militias. He was able to elude detection and enforcement with careful selection of words, and by relying on disappearing stories.</p><p>Ali Alexander在平台上工作，使用媒体外观和名人认可。我们还观察到他正式与他人组织，以传播该术语，包括与与民兵联系的其他用户。他能够通过仔细选择的单词来避开检测和执法，并依靠消失的故事。</p><p> This sort of deep investigation takes time, situational awareness, and context that we often don’t have. What sort of behavioral signals might we be able to leverage to observe coordination when we lack the time or background for in depth investigations? What sort of analyses and models might we build to help us identify these networks in the future?</p><p> 这种深度调查需要时间，努力意识和我们经常没有的背景。当我们在深度调查中缺乏时间或背景时，我们可以利用哪种行为信号可以利用来遵守协调？我们可以建立哪些分析和模型来帮助我们将来识别这些网络？</p><p>  One way to observe coordination in a movement is by looking at growth hacking. Growth hacking might not always be bad. A democratic movement, a movement seeking human rights, or even an advertising movement, may all employ legitimate techniques to grow their audience quickly. However, when the growth is mixed with the signals of harm we described above, this rapid growth indicates the spread of harm, and may indicate  coordinated harm.</p><p>  观察运动中协调的一种方法是通过观察增长黑客。成长黑客可能并不总是糟糕。民主运动，寻求人权的运动，甚至广告运动，甚至可能都采用合法的技术来快速发展观众。然而，当增长与我们上面描述的危害信号混合时，这种快速增长表明危害的蔓延，并且可能表明协调造成的危害。</p><p> Stop the Steal was able to grow rapidly through coordinated Group invites: 67% of StS joins came through invites. Moreover, these invites were dominated by a handful of super-inviters: 30% of invites came from just 0.3% of inviters. Inviters also tended to be connected to one another through interactions — they comment on, tag, and share one another’s content. These were inviters with more than 500 invitees each. In the top StS Group, there were 137 super inviters, with 500 invitees each. Of these users, 88 were admins of other StS Groups, suggesting cooperation in growing the movement. These super-inviters had other indicators of spammy behavior: 73% had bad friending stats, with a friend request reject rate above 50%. 125 of them likely obfuscated their home locations. 73 of them were members of harmful conspiracy Groups. We also saw that inviters to these Groups tend to be connected. At the beginning of January, before the post-insurrection spike in StS and PP Groups, half of all inviters with &gt; 100 invitees also engaged with one another either directly through messaging and tagging, or with one another’s content in the previous month, suggesting that many inviters were connected to one another.</p><p> 停止偷窃能够通过协调小组邀请迅速增长：67％的STS Joins通过邀请了。此外，这些邀请由少数超人员主导：30％的邀请来自仅为1,0.3％的应邀人员。邀请者还通过互动彼此相互连接 - 他们评论，标签，并分享彼此的内容。这些都是500多个邀请人的应邀人员。在顶级STS集团中，有137名超级邀请者，每次邀请500名。在这些用户中，88名是其他圣集团的管理员，建议在发展运动方面的合作。这些超级邀请者有其他垃圾行为指标：73％的人有不好的合作统计数据，朋友请求拒绝率超过50％。其中125人可能会发现他们的家庭位置。其中73人是有害阴谋团体的成员。我们还看到，这些团体的邀请者往往会连接。在1月初，在STS和PP群体后叛乱飙升之前，所有入学者的一半是＆gt; 100邀请也通过消息传递和标记，或者在上个月的彼此内容中彼此进行，建议许多邀请者彼此相连。</p><p> [The Facebook report included a graphic here, showing a network of how “most heavy inviters are connected to one another.”]</p><p> [Facebook报告在此处包含一个图形，显示了“大多数沉重的邀请者彼此连接的网络”。]</p><p> This growth occurred despite our attempts to prevent it: the Groups Task Force identified risks around Group inviting leading to the rapid growth of anti-quarantine Groups. Super-inviters were able to quickly grow new Groups, both allowing the rapid growth of harmful Groups, and helping to avoid enforcement as backup Groups replaced disabled Groups. In response, a cap of 100 invites/person/day was implemented. We released an additional new invite rate limit of 30 adds/hour (now deprecated) during the growth of Stop the Steal Groups for users adding new friends (&lt; 3 days) to new groups (&lt; 7 days) to Groups with some certain ACDC properties. However, all of the rate limits were effective only to a certain extent and the groups were regardless able to grow substantially.</p><p> 尽管我们试图阻止它，但仍然存在：团体工作队确定了集团邀请的风险，导致反检疫群体的快速增长。超级邀请者能够快速增长新的群体，既可允许有害群体的快速增长，并帮助避免执法作为备份组取代了残疾人群体。作为回应，实施了100个邀请/人/日的概率。我们发布了额外的新邀请率限制30个添加/小时（现在已弃用）在停止窃取组的增长期间，为用户添加新的朋友（＆lt; 3天）到新的群体（＆lt 7天），以某种份额ACDC属性。然而，所有的速率限制都仅在一定程度上有效，并且该组的无论如何都要大量生长。</p><p> Any successful movement also has organic growth that should not be discounted. A third of the growth came from self joins, and while the plurality of the inviting came from a handful of users, 82% of inviters invited fewer than 10 others. This combination of growth hacking with organic growth made exemplified how complicated harmful network movements can be. In order to explore this growth and the extent to which it was driven by amplification of the slogans, we explored the way the Content flowed through the broader StS network, in Groups and beyond.</p><p> 任何成功的运动也有有机增长，不应折扣。三分之一的增长来自自我联盟，而多个邀请来自少数用户，82％的邀请者邀请少于10人。这种增长和有机生长的组合使得具有举例说明了复杂的有害网络运动如何。为了探索这种增长以及通过扩增口号驱动的程度，我们探讨了流经更广泛的STS网络的内容，分组和超越的方式。 </p><p>  Using Information Corridors, we were able to identify the larger community where StS and election delegitimization was discussed most heavily. We started by identifying users who posted the most using delegitimizing language, and who used a wide variety of terms. These were our high StS engagers. We then fanned out to everyone they interacted with, and identified those users who were also using a lot of Stop the Steal language, or who had a high propensity for doing so based on our classifiers. This network of high StS users was our Information Corridor (IC). It identifies the part of the social network on platform where the harmful content is circulating. For an overview demo of Stop the Steal Information Corridors, more detail see here.</p><p>使用信息走廊，我们能够识别最大讨论STS和选举德国的较大社区。我们首先识别使用Delegimized语言发布最多的用户，谁使用各种各样的术语。这些是我们的高速公路。然后，我们煽动他们与众不同的每个人，并确定了那些也使用很多停止窃取语言的用户，或者在我们的分类器的基础上具有高倾向。这个高性能网络的网络是我们的信息走廊（IC）。它识别有害内容流通的平台上的社交网络的一部分。对于停止窃取信息走廊的概述演示，详细介绍了这里。</p><p> Out of 6,450 high engagers, 4,025 (63%) of them were directly connected to one another, meaning they interacted with one another’s content or messaged one another. When using the full Information Corridor, 77% were connected to one another. This suggests that the bulk of the Stop the Steal amplification was happening as part of a cohesive movement.</p><p> 在6,450个高的收纳中，其中4,025（63％）彼此直接相连，这意味着它们与彼此的内容或彼此发消息互动。使用完整信息走廊时，77％彼此连接。这表明大部分停止窃取扩增正在发生作为凝聚力运动的一部分。</p><p> [The Facebook report includes a network diagram here, showing how &#34;Information Corridors allow us to identify the part of the network where harm circulates.&#34;]</p><p> [Facebook报告包括一个网络图，显示如何＆＃34;信息走廊允许我们识别伤害循环的网络的一部分。＆＃34;]</p><p> By tracking these language networks, we can better capture the coordinated harm that flows through the network. Members of the corridor produced 33% more hate, 31% more VNI compared to the broader community around the high engagers.  Members of an information corridor are vulnerable to the harmful message that is being propagated because they are subject to, and most likely to engage with, that harmful content. Amplifiers in the IC are users who are connected to many other of these vulnerable users, so named because anything they say reaches a larger audience. By looking at patterns in amplifier language, we can better understand the harms that are being pushed through the IC.  Amplifiers posted 98% more VNI and 40% more hate. The core of that network had 85% more VNI, and 45% more hate. We also identified the core of the IC — the set of users who all tightly engage with one another, using k-core decomposition.</p><p> 通过跟踪这些语言网络，我们可以更好地捕获通过网络流动的协调伤害。走廊的成员产生了33％的仇恨，而VNI比高乐队周围更广泛的社区更多的VNI。信息走廊的成员容易受到正在传播的有害信息，因为它们受到影响，并且最有可能与那些有害的内容进行互动。 IC中的放大器是连接到许多其他易受攻击的用户的用户，所以所谓的，因为他们说的任何东西都达到了更大的受众。通过在放大器语言中查看模式，我们可以更好地理解通过IC推动的危害。放大器张贴了98％的VNI和40％的仇恨。该网络的核心有85％的VNI，45％更多的仇恨。我们还确定了IC的核心 - 使用K-Core分解，全部紧紧地与彼此紧密地啮合的用户。</p><p> [The Facebook report includes a graphic here, showing relationships between &#34;closely connected users at the center of the network.”]</p><p> [Facebook报告在此处包含一个图形，显示在网络中央的＆＃34之间的关系。“]</p><p> In order to understand how the movement perpetuates harm, we also need to understand the extent to which it persists beyond the coordinators and amplifiers. We also want to understand the extent to which users who interacted with coordinators and high engagers are also producing harm. To do this, we looked at audience closeness around the inviters described above. Users who engaged the most with inviters with at least 50 invitees. Those users who interacted the most with those inviters produced 92% more VNI, and 49% more hate. Relatedly, we also found that information corridors help link the users in the core of the StS network to those in the periphery, helping spread the message across the full network.</p><p> 为了了解运动如何延续伤害，我们还需要了解它超越协调员和放大器的程度。我们还希望了解与协调员和高收纳者互动的用户的程度也在产生伤害。为此，我们围绕上述邀请者仔细观察了受众的亲密关系。与最多有50名邀请人的邀请者一起参与最多的用户。那些与那些邀请者相互作用的用户产生了92％的VNI，仇恨49％。相关的，我们还发现信息走廊有助于将STS网络核心中的用户链接到外围中的用户，帮助传播整个网络的消息。</p><p> Overall, we were able to show that where PP and StS signals were being amplified through content and inviting, there was also higher levels of hate and violence, suggesting that these movements were harmful and that the harm was perpetuated through a network that we were able to define.</p><p> 总的来说，我们能够通过内容和诱人放大PP和STS信号，仇恨和暴力水平较高，表明这些运动是有害的，并且危害通过我们所能的网络持久界定。 </p><p>  Stop the Steal wasn’t the only movement that grew around the D14N theme. Patriot Party was another movement that grew out of and eventually in competition with StS, showing similar levels of harm. Many of the coordinators for PP expressed a disappointment with the StS movement’s failure to do what it promised, and a need to go further by bringing on systemic change through a new political party. On the other site, StS admins and real-life leaders had a large amount of celebrity and official-ness about them (the ones that weren’t banned from platform — Trump, Roger Stone, Alex Jones...etc.) that they didn’t necessarily want to be seen as deflecting from the traditional Republican Party to start a scrappy, potentially angrier Patriot Party.</p><p>停止偷窃不是D14N主题唯一一个围绕D14N主题的运动。爱国者派对是另一个在与圣地竞争中脱离的另一个动作，表现出类似的伤害水平。对于PP的许多协调员对STS运动失败表示失望，并通过通过新的政党进行系统性变革来进一步进一步。在另一个网站上，圣行系和现实生活领导人对他们有很大的名人和官方（官方）（那些没有从平台禁止的人 - 特朗普，罗杰石，亚历克斯琼斯等。）他们不一定希望被视为偏离传统共和党，开始一个丑陋，潜在的愤怒的爱国者聚会。</p><p> Admins of PP attempted to recruit members from StS and Joe Biden is NOT my President Groups. Popular posts and frequent posters on PP pages and groups often used the Stop the Steal slogan, especially prior to inauguration. We also saw that PP was able to grow within StS corridors: members of the StS IC were 6% more likely to use the term “Patriot Party.” In the end, PP never grew as much as StS, in large part because of the lessons we learned from StS and were able to rapidly apply to PP.</p><p> PP的管理员试图招募STS和Joe Biden的成员不是我的总统团体。 PP页面和组上的流行帖子和经常海报经常使用停止窃取口号，特别是在就职典礼之前。我们还看到PP能够在Sts走廊内生长：STS IC的成员可能更多地使用“爱国者”一词的可能性。最后，PP从来没有像STS一样长大，大部分是因为我们从Sts学到的教训，并且能够迅速申请PP。</p><p> [The Facebook report includes a pair of graphics here, showing how “Information Corridors” allowed the company to “track additional linguistic signals that grow within the network.”]</p><p> [Facebook报告包括一对图形，展示了“信息走廊”允许该公司“跟踪在网络内增长的其他语言信号。”</p><p> The leaders of PP had mixed success recruiting from StS supporters. As StS Groups were disabled, we their members flock to PP Groups: 20% of the Groups that members of disabled StS Groups joined were PP Groups. We were able to mitigate this growth by feature limiting Groups that many users joined after being disabled as an election Break The Glass measure. However, StS groups weren’t the main source for PP Groups: only 6.5% of actioned PP Group members were part of an actioned StS Group, and only 1.1% of actioned StS Group members joined an actioned PP Group, with only 3 out of roughly 1000 shared admins. Moreover, we saw that PP was primarily pushed by amplifiers within the StS IC who were not fully successful: we did not see widespread use of the PP term by less engaged members of the IC — learning from our previous work on StS, we were able to stop PP before it was able to spread.</p><p> PP的领导人汇集了STS支持者的成功。随着STS团体被禁用，我们的成员植入了PP组：20％的禁用STS团体成员加入为PP组。我们能够通过限制组来减轻这种增长，其中许多用户在被禁用后被禁用后被禁用，以打破玻璃措施。但是，圣集团不是PP组的主要来源：只有6.5％的行动的PP集团成员是Actioned STS组的一部分，只有1.1％的被动的STS集团成员加入了一个被动的PP组，只有3个大约1000名共享管理员。此外，我们看到PP主要被STS IC内的放大器推动，他们没有完全成功：我们没有看到通过少数人的IC  - 学习从我们以前的STS的工作中广泛使用PP项，我们能够在能够传播之前停止PP。</p><p> [The Facebook report included a graphic here, showing “Group membership Jaccard similarity.”]</p><p> [Facebook报告包括此处的图形，显示“组成员资格jaccard相似性。”]</p><p>   One of the most effective and compelling things we did was to look for overlaps in the observed networks with militias and hate orgs. This worked because we were in a context where we had these networks well mapped. During crises there are likely to be multiple escalations ongoing at once, with different teams focusing on different networks around DOI, misinfo, and other harms. By combining these, we could better understand how the nature of the harm being coordinated, and the myriad of tactics being used. As PP arose, showing the connection between PP and StS helped us understand the harm being perpetuated by PP in context, when the harm might have been </p><p>   我们所做的最有效和最引人注目的事物之一是寻找观察到的网络与民兵和仇恨组织的重叠。这是因为我们在我们有这些网络映射的背景下。在危机期间，有可能是一次多次升级，不同的团队专注于Doi，MISINFO等危害的不同网络。通过结合这些，我们可以更好地了解如何协调伤害的性质以及被使用的策略。由于PP出现，显示PP和ST之间的联系帮助我们了解在环境中造成危害的情况下通过PP持久的危害</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/full-facebook-stop-the-steal-internal-report">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/full-facebook-stop-the-steal-internal-report</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facebook/">#facebook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/停止/">#停止</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/stopped/">#stopped</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sts/">#sts</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
