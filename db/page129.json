In 2019, there were an estimated 229 million cases of malaria and 409,000 deaths globally, creating an extraordinary cost in terms of human morbidity, mortality, economic burden, and regional social stability. Worldwide, Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite species which causes the vast majority of deaths. Those at highest risk of severe disease include pregnant women, children and malaria na\u00efve travelers. Malaria countermeasures development has historically been a priority research area for the Department of Defense as the disease remains a top threat to U.S.   deployed to endemic regions.\n  A safe, effective malaria   has long been an elusive target for scientists. The most advanced malaria vaccine is RTS,S, a first-generation product developed in partnership with WRAIR. RTS,S is based on the circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum, the most dangerous and widespread species of malaria parasite. While RTS,S is an impactful countermeasure in the fight against malaria, field studies have revealed limited sterile efficacy and duration of protection. The limitations associated with RTS,S and other first-generation malaria vaccines have led scientists to evaluate new platforms and second-generation approaches for malaria vaccines.\n  &#34;Recent successes with vaccines against COVID-19 highlight the advantages of mRNA-based platforms\u2014notably highly targeted design, flexible and rapid manufacturing and ability to promote strong immune responses in a manner not yet explored,&#34; said Dr. Evelina Angov, a researcher at WRAIR&#39;s Malaria Biologics Branch and senior author on the paper. &#34;Our goal is to translate those advances to a safe, effective vaccine against malaria.&#34;\n  Like RTS,S, the vaccine relies on P. falciparum&#39;s circumsporozoite protein to elicit an immune response. However, rather than administering a version of the protein directly, this approach uses mRNA\u2014accompanied by a lipid nanoparticle which protects from premature degradation and helps stimulate the immune system\u2014 to prompt cells to code for circumsporozoite protein themselves. Those proteins then trigger a protective response against malaria but cannot actually cause infection.\n  &#34;Our vaccine achieved high levels of protection against malaria infection in mice,&#34; said Katherine Mallory, a WRAIR researcher at the time of the article&#39;s submission and lead author on the paper. &#34;While more work remains before clinical testing, these results are an encouraging sign that an effective, mRNA-based   vaccine is achievable.&#34;             Citation: mRNA vaccine yields full protection against malaria in mice (2021, June 18) retrieved 18 June 2021 from https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-mrna-vaccine-yields-full-malaria.html\n  This document is subject to copyright.

open a formal investigation into its lucrative digital advertising business before the end of the year, said people familiar with the matter.\n It would mark a new front by the EU competition enforcer against Google. It has in the last decade fined the company more than 8 billion euros ($9.8 billion) for blocking rivals in online shopping, Android smartphones and online advertising.\n An EU probe would focus on Google&#39;s position vis-a-vis advertisers, publishers, intermediaries and rivals, one of the people said, indicating deeper scrutiny than the French antitrust agency&#39;s case concluded last week.\n Google made $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world. Ads on its properties, including search, YouTube and Gmail, accounted for the bulk of sales and profits.\n About 16% of revenue came from its display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.\n Both units are under fire. The U.S. Justice Department, joined by some states, sued Google last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house.\n France last week settled with Google for $268 million and various commitments over similar allegations related to the network business, and the unit also must work closely with Britain&#39;s competition regulator on upcoming software changes as part of a settlement reached days later.  read more\n The Commission declined to comment. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google&#39;s ad empire. Market researcher eMarketer expects Google to control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display.\n While the numbers may not look monopolistic at first blush, advertisers and rivals contend that Google&#39;s various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid.\n They say Google takes advantage of the dependence buyers, sellers and intermediaries have on it to extract high fees from all sides and block rivals from fairly competing with it.\n In a questionnaire sent to Google rivals and third parties earlier this year and seen by Reuters, the EU watchdog asked if advertisers receive rebates when they use Google intermediaries which allow advertisers or media agencies to buy advertising inventory from many sources.   read more\n The Commission should conclude ongoing cases before starting new ones, said Thomas Hoppner, a partner at law firm Hausfeld, and who advises several complainants against Google.\n &#34;From the practitioner&#39;s point of view and from the industry&#39;s point of view, it appears equally important to bring investigations into local search and Google&#39;s job search to an end when other authorities have opened investigations into Google&#39;s adtech,&#34;

This information will continue to be updated and overlaps somewhat with the  coreutils FAQ,with this list focusing on less frequent potential issues.\n chmod -R is redundant and tricky.If for example you copy a dir from VFAT and want to turn off executable bits on filesusing  chmod -R 644,that will fail to recurse as it removes the executable bits from dirs.This is achievable in various ways:  cut doesn&#39;t work with fields separated by arbitrary whitespace.It&#39;s often better to use  awk oreven  join -a1 -o1.$field $file /dev/null cut -s only suppresses lines without delimiters.Therefore if you have a line with a missing fieldbut it does contain some delimiters, a blank line is output\n Similarly, if you want to output a blank line when there are no delimitersone needs to append a delimiter like:\n  dd  iflag=fullblock is usually what you wantbecause when reading from a fifo/pipe you often get a short read,which means you get too little data if you specify &#34; count&#34;,or too much data if you specify &#34; sync&#34;. For example: Note we do warn in certain cases since version 8.10, but not with count=1 aboveas short reads are often used with count=1 as an idiom to &#34;consume available data&#34;,though perhaps  dd iflag=nonblock would be a moredirect and general way to do that? dd  conv=noerror really also needs  conv=syncso that if reading from failing disk,one gets correctly aligned data, with unreadable bits replaced with NULs.Note if there is a read error anywhere in a block,the whole block will be discarded. So one needsto balance between speed (bigger) and minimized data loss (smaller).This is simpler and more dynamic in a more dedicated toollike  ddrescue.\n dd  skip=0x100 doesn&#39;t skip anythingas the &#34;0x&#34; prefix is treated as a zero multiplier.coreutils &gt;= 8.26 will warn about this at least,suggesting to use &#34;00x&#34; if that really was the intention.\n For full portability the  -P option is neededwhen parsing the output from df. Line wrapping is avoided, thoughdf will no longer wrap lines since version 8.11 (Apr 2011) to helpavoid this gotcha. Also if one needs to parse the header,the  -P option will use more standardised (but ambiguous) wording.See also the  Block size issue. If two or more hard links point to the same file, only one of thehard links is counted. The FILE argument order affects which links arecounted, and changing the argument order may change the numbers that du outputs. Note this also impacts specified directories which is confusing: $ cd git/coreutils$ du -s ./ ./tests593120 ./$ du -s ./tests ./  # depth first gets items listed (though counted independently)10036 ./tests583084 ./ # Note order is significant even with implicit independence$ du -s --separate-dirs ./tests ./128 ./tests16268 ./$ du -s --separate-dirs ./ ./tests16268 ./\nNote du doesn&#39;t handle  reflinked files specially,and thus will count all instances of a reflinked file.  echo is non portable and its behaviour diverges betweensystems and shell builtins etc. One should really consider using printf instead.This shell session illustrates some inconsistencies.Where you see  env being used, that is selecting the coreutilsstandalone version: $ echo -e -n  # outputs nothing$ echo -n -e$ echo -- -n  # option terminator outputted-- -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -e -n-e -n$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 env echo -n -e  # no output either \u203d\n The exit status of expr is a confusing gotcha.POSIX states that exit status of 1 is used if &#34;the expression evaluates to null or zero&#34;,which you can see in these examples: $ expr 2 - 1; echo $?10$ expr 2 - 2; echo $?01$ expr substr 01 1 1; echo $?01$ expr &#39; &#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?10$ expr &#39;&#39; : &#39;^ *$&#39;; echo $?01 # number of matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;[0-9]$&#39;; echo $?10 # actual matched characters returned$ expr 0 : &#39;\\([0-9]\\)$&#39;; echo $?01\nThe string matching above is especially confusing, thoughdoes conform to POSIX, and is consistent across solaris, FreeBSD and GNU utils. As for changing the behaviour, it&#39;s probably not possible due tobackwards compatibility issues. For example the &#39;^..*$&#39; casewould need to change the handling of the &#39;*&#39; in the expression,which would break a script like: printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; 1 2 &#39;&#39; 3 |while read line; do expr &#34;$line&#34; : &#39;^[0-9]*$&#39; &gt;/dev/null || break # at first blank line echo process &#34;$line&#34;done\nNote, using a leading ^ in the expression is redundant and non portable. ls -lrt will also reverse sort names for fileswith matching timestamps (common in /dev/ and /proc/ etc.)This is as per POSIX but probably not what the user wanted.There is no way to reverse by time and have non reversed name sorting.  ln -nsf is needed to update symlinks,though note that this will overwrite existing files,and cause links to be created within existing directories.  mkdir -p --mode=... only applies the mode to theright-most directory. Any parent directories are created with&#39;u+wx&#39; modified by umask. If you want to control the mode for all created dirs,you can use a umask like Note that the user &#39;wx&#39; bits can not be cleared for parent dirs.Note also that special mode bits like setuid are not set atomically,either with --mode on the right-most directory, or a subsequent chmod requiredfor created parent directories. Note also to be careful with  chmod -R  If changing the umask before invoking mkdir is not that easy - maybebecause not called via a shell -, then an alternative to the aboveumask method is to specify each of the target directories separately,e.g.: But it is important to know that &#39;mkdir&#39; does not adjust the permissionbits if any of those directories already existed.If you do want to ensure a directory hierarchy with particular permissionsone can use the `install` command instead like:   nl defaults to  -d &#39;\\:&#39; by default.Therefore any lines that contain only  &#39;\\:&#39;,  &#39;\\:\\:&#39;or  &#39;\\:\\:\\:&#39; will reset numbering.If you want to number lines irrespective on content then you need to specify  -d &#39;&#39;,or alternatively use the less flexible  cat -n option. The checksum utilities like md5sum, sha1sum etc. add backslashes to the output namesif those names contain &#39;\\n&#39; or &#39;\\&#39; characters. Also &#39;*&#39; is added to the outputwhere O_BINARY is significant (CYGWIN). Therefore automatic processing of theseutilities require one to  unescape first.  rm -rf does not mean &#34;delete as much as possible&#34;. It only avoids prompts.For example with a non writeable dir, you will not be ableto remove any contents. Therefore this is sometimes necessary to:  A very common issue encountered is with the default ordering of the  sort utility.Usually what is required is a simple byte comparison, though by default the collationorder of the current locale is used. To use the simple comparison logic you can LC_ALL=C sort ... as detailed in the FAQ. As well as being slower, the locale based ordering can often be surprising.For example some character representations,like the full width forms of latin numbers, compare equal to each other. $ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | ltrace -e strcoll sortsort-&gt;strcoll(&#34;\\357\\274\\222&#34;, &#34;\\357\\274\\221&#34;) = 0\uff12\uff11$ printf &#39;%s\\n&#39; \uff12 \uff11 | sort -u\uff12\nThe equal comparison issue with --unique can even impact inthe &#34;C&#34; locale, for example with  --numeric-sort dropping items unexpectedly.Note this example also demonstrates that --unique implies --stable,to select the first encountered item in the matching set.  Related to locale ordering, there is the  i18n patchon Fedora/RHEL/SUSE which has its own issues. Note disabling the locale specifichandling as described above effectively avoids these issues.  Example 2: case folding results in incorrect ordering:  Fields specified with  -k are separated by default by runs of blank characters (space and tab),and by default the blank characters preceding a field are  included in the comparison,which depending on your locale could be significant to the sorting order. This is confusing enoughon its own, but is compounded with the  --field-separator and  --ignore-leading-blanks options.Ignoring leading blanks (-b) is particularly confusing, because... Also precisely specifying a particular field, requires both the start  and endfields specified. I.E. to sort on field 2 you use -k2 ,2. These field delineation issues along with others are so confusing,that the  sort --debug option was addedin version 8.6 to highlight the matching extent and other consequences of the various options.\n  sort -R does randomize the input similarlyto the shuf command, but also ensures that matching keys are grouped together.shuf also provides optimizations when outputting a subset of the input.  split produces file names that may be surprising,as it defaults to a two letter suffix for initial files, butto support an arbitrary number of files, has a feature to widen the letters inthe output file names as needed. The widening scheme ensures file names are sorted correctlywhen using standard shell sorting, when subsequently listing orconcatenating the resultant files. For example:  split behaves the same with the --numeric-suffixes/-d option, which couldlead to unexpected numeric sequences. This was done again to ease sortingof the output (which is usually not inspected by humans for large sequences),but mainly for backwards compatibility with existing concatenation scriptsthat use standard sorting. The recommended solution is to specify a -a/--suffix-length parameterwhich still allows for standard ordering at the shell,but with more natural numbers:  tac like  wc has issues dealing with files withouta last &#39;\\n&#39; character.  tail -F is probably what you want rather than -fas the latter doesn&#39;t follow log rotations etc. tee by default will exit immediately upon receiving SIGPIPEto be POSIX compliant and to support applications like yes | tee log | timeout process.Now this is problematic in the presence of &#34;early close&#34; pipes,often seen when combining tee with bash &gt;(process substitutions).Starting with coreutils 8.24 (Jul 2015), tee has the new -p, --output-erroroption to control the operation in such cases. $ seq 100000 | tee &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)114139$ seq 100000 | tee -p &gt;(head -n1) &gt; &gt;(tail -n1)1100000\n The mode of operation of test depends on the number of arguments.Therefore you will not get an expected error in cases like test -s $file || echo no data &gt;&amp;2,if &#34;$file&#34; is empty or unset. That&#39;s because test(1) will thenbe operating in string testing mode, which will return successdue to &#34;-s&#34; being interpreted as a true expression.Instead ensure the variable is appropriately quoted to avoid such issues: test -s &#34;$file&#34; || echo no data &gt;&amp;2.  wc -l on a file in which the last linedoesn&#39;t end with &#39;\\n&#39; character will return a value of one-less thanmight be expected as wc is standardised to just count &#39;\\n&#39; characters.POSIX in fact doesn&#39;t consider a file without a &#39;\\n&#39; as the last characterto be a text file at all. Also by only counting &#39;\\n&#39; characters resultsin consistent counts whether counting concatenated files, ortotaling individual files.  wc -L counts the maximum  display width for a line,considering only valid, printable characters, but not terminal control codes. # invalid UTF-8 sequence not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\xf2\\xa5&#34; | wc -L0 # unprintable characters  even in the C locale are not counted:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C wc -L0 # Bytes can be counted using sed:$ printf &#34;\\xe2\\x99\\xa5&#34; | LC_ALL=C sed &#39;s/././g&#39; | wc -L3 # Terminal control chars are not handled specially:$ printf &#39;\\x1b[33mf\\bred\\x1b[m\\n&#39; | tee /dev/tty | wc -L red10\n The  df,  du,  ls --block-sizeoption is unusual in that appending a  B to the unit, changes it  from binary to decimal.I.E. KB means 1000, while K means 1024. In general the units representations in coreutils are unfortunate,but an accident of history.POSIX species &#39;k&#39; and &#39;b&#39; to mean 1024 and 512 respectively.Standards wise &#39;k&#39; should really mean 1000 and &#39;K&#39; 1024.Then extending from that we now have (which we can&#39;t change for compatibility reasons): Note there is new flexibility to consider when controlling theoutput of numeric units, by leveraging the  numfmtutility. For example to control the output of du you could definea function like:  Discussed separately at  Time zone ambiguities", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:51:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

", "note_en": "When Ring wanted to boost sales of it surveillance cameras and burnish its self-styled image as a crime-fighting company, it embarked on a brand-ambassador marketing campaign that would be familiar to many startups. But rather than chase down the Instagram influencers or beat bloggers, the company instead wooed officers at the Los Angeles Police Department.\n For years, including during Amazon\u2019s early ownership of the company, Ring gave no fewer than 100 LAPD officers free devices or discount codes worth tens of thousands of dollars, and possibly more, according to a new report from the  Los Angeles Times.\n Emails obtained by the LA Times through a public records request reveal Ring employees encouraging LAPD officers to \u201cspread the word about how this doorbell is proven to reduce crime in neighborhoods\u201d and offering freebies and discounts.\n \u201cRing and its relationship with police departments, including the LAPD, is but one example of a burgeoning problem in which there is a lack of clarity as to where the public sector ends and private surveillance capitalism begins,\u201d Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, told Ars.\n As word of the influencer campaign spread through the LAPD, officers who weren\u2019t approached by Ring employees reached out to them anyway, requesting free products and discounts.\n \u201cWe have a favor to ask..,\u201d wrote Officer Maria Gray. \u201cEvery year, we have a West LA Division Beach party... We use our measly station fund and buy some gifts to raffle off as prizes. Without me asking, do you see where I\u2019m going with this email? More importantly, we\u2019d love for you to come and attend. Bring some friends, our treat.\u201d August Cziment, Ring\u2019s director of operations, replied, \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to donate a Ring Doorbell and perhaps a new Solar Powered Security sign if that\u2019s of interest? :)\u201d\n Another station received more than $12,000 in freebies after an officer sent an email containing promotional language that he first had Cziment approve.\n     LAPD has an  ethics code, of course. It says that officers may not \u201cuse their position to secure directly or indirectly unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or others\u201d and they \u201cshall not accept any gifts, gratuities or favors of any kind which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence their actions with respect to City business.\u201d But for many of the cases the Times uncovered, the LAPD did not appear to be concerned. Discount codes are \u201cgenerally not in conflict with our Code of Ethics,\u201d Det. Meghan Aguilar told the LA Times. \u201cOf course, each situation is looked at on a case by case basis.\u201d\n One email exchange shows how officers blurred the lines between advocating for a class of security products like security cameras\u2014which is allowed and sometimes encouraged\u2014and becoming outright salespeople for specific brands like Ring. Officer Eric Mollinedo emailed Ring\u2019s Cziment in April 2016 asking for promo codes and a free doorbell, mentioning that he would be working a booth at a public safety fair. Cziment happily sent him a free unit along with flyers for the booth. Mollinedo later emailed Cziment, saying, \u201cWas a good day today at the Public Safety fair... talked up Ring and had (5) officers/reserve officers purchase them!\u201d\n Tajsar, the ACLU attorney, said this sort of arrangement isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cRing in particular has a history of poaching police chiefs and executives, hiring them, and then using them to peddle Ring\u2019s wares with the connections they have from their former lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a revolving door Ring has created to gain market share across the country. That raises a whole host of ethical concerns about corruption, pay to play, and ethics rules around disclosures.\u201d\n  Ring\u2019s campaign came at a time when the company had partnered with LAPD to give out 500 free video doorbells in Los Angeles\u2019 Wilshire Park neighborhood in an attempt to prove its crime-fighting claims. In March 2016, LAPD and Ring held a  joint news conference announcing that, after installing just 40 cameras in the neighborhood, burglaries had dropped by 55 percent in six months. Later, the company would amend the results, saying the drop occurred over seven months, not six.\n    Neither claim was peer-reviewed, and Ring hasn\u2019t released the specifics of its study, but a report by  MIT Technology Review cast doubt on the findings. After receiving the locations of the installed cameras from the neighborhood association and after examining public data on crime in those districts, reporter Mark Harris found that burglaries had, in fact, increased when compared with the previous year. What\u2019s more, by 2017, burglaries had surged to their highest in seven years. Nonetheless, Ring  continued to tout its \u201ccrime fighting\u201d capabilities.\n  Ring wound down its influencer campaign around the time it rolled out its Neighbors app, which allows users to share and comment on nearby videos. LAPD was given access to a special Ring-provided portal to locate and request footage. The company bills the portal as a time-saver,  saying in videos it sends to police departments, \u201cNo more going door-to-door to look for cameras and asking for footage.\u201d All investigators have to do is set a specific time and area of interest and Ring assists in contacting users whose camera logs match the query.\n In addition to the arrangement with the LAPD, Ring has made deals with  hundreds of police departments across the US to give them access to the law enforcement portal. Ring\u2019s privacy policy regarding footage is \u201clax,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why Ring is so aggressively marketing toward police departments,\u201d Tajsar said. \u201cThey see police departments as the cat\u2019s paw. They can do Ring\u2019s marketing for them rather than Ring coming directly to us.\u201d\n The portal also allows law enforcement in many instances to sidestep the need for a warrant, which provides judicial oversight and greater transparency. Since many Ring users voluntarily post videos to the Neighbors app, departments have access to a pool of people who are more willing to share footage with them.\n After the LA Times contacted Ring for comment ahead of the story, the company updated its policies so people can view footage requests from law enforcement agencies by adding a post category called \u201cRequest for Assistance.\u201d The hitch? You have to use the Neighbors app to see the footage.\n The spread of a privately controlled surveillance network that offers ready access for law enforcement has privacy advocates concerned. \u201cThe potential for abuse here is tremendous,\u201d Tajsar said.\n \u201cIt has so much room for civil liberties violations,\u201d Heidi Boghosian, a lawyer and former executive director of the National Lawyers Guild, told the LA Times. \u201cWhen you have the escalation of people\u2019s fears of property or violent crime, it changes the way they interpret ordinary actions of someone walking down the street or ringing their doorbell,\u201d she said, \u201cAnd that can [lead to] communities of color [being] falsely accused of crimes.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:15:49",

The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a  225% increase in total losses from ransomware in the United States in 2020. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, businesses are under attack every 11 seconds, on average, and damage losses are projected to  reach $20 billion worldwide. Against this backdrop, the Cybereason Global Ransomware Study measured how much financial and reputational damage these attacks wreak on businesses.\n Dealing with the aftermath of a ransomware attack can be complicated and costly. The vast majority of organizations experienced  significant business impact due to ransomware attacks, including loss of revenue (66%), damage to the organization\u2019s brand (53%), unplanned workforce reductions (29%), and even closure of the business altogether (25%).\n   After an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top 5 solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%), security operations (SOC) (48%), endpoint protection (44%), data backup and recovery (43%), and email scanning (41%).\u00a0The least deployed solutions post-attack included web scanning (40%), endpoint detection and response (EDR) and extended detection and response (XDR) technologies (38%), antivirus software (38%), mobile and SMS security solutions (36%), and managed security services provider (MSSP) or managed detection and response (MDR) provider (34%). Only 3% of respondents said they did not make any  new security investments after a ransomware attack.\n Cybereason\u2019s study found that the majority of organizations that chose to pay ransom demands in the past were not immune to subsequent ransomware attacks, often by the same threat actors. In fact, 80% of organizations that paid the ransom were hit by a second attack, and almost half were hit by the same threat group.\n This study offers insight into the business impact of ransomware attacks across key industry verticals and reveals data that can be leveraged to improve ransomware defenses. For example, after an organization experienced a ransomware attack, the top two solutions implemented included security awareness training (48%) and security operations (48%). This research underscores that prevention is the best strategy for managing ransomware risk and ensuring your organization does not fall victim to a ransomware attack in the first place.\n 1,263 cybersecurity professionals took part in the study commissioned by Cybereason and fielded by Censuswide, with participants in varying industries from the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, France, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore.\n  VentureBeat&#39;s mission is to be a digital town square for technical decision-makers to gain knowledge about transformative technology and transact.Our site delivers essential information on data technologies and strategies to guide you as you lead your organizations.

Katie Brown signed   House Bill 2574 into law on Tuesday, adding natural organic reduction to the range of approved after-life options in the west coast state. Sponsored and developed by Rep. Pam Marsh (D - Southern Jackson County), the bill met Oregonians\u2019 growing interest in sustainable alternatives to traditional deathcare.\n    \u201cThis is a hard issue for people to think about; it&#39;s not a decision that any of us get to avoid,\u201d Marsh told Motherboard over the phone. \u201cIt has an appeal, certainly not to all consumers, but to many of us who are really looking for ways to think about how our footprint on the earth continues after life is gone.\u201d\n  The move heeds a   growing call from environmentalists across the country to clean up the end-of-life industry. The most common methods of body disposal come with hefty environmental impacts: traditional burials, in which a corpse is embalmed with formaldehyde and placed in a casket underground, permanently   occupy large swaths of land and have been found to   leach toxins into nearby soil and waterways. Cremation\u2013in which a body is burned into ash\u2014is an energy suck and emits damaging   pollutants and   carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n  By comparison, the process of so-called   natural organic reduction, which breaks down the body into soil, has a small environmental footprint. For example,   Recompose,   the country\u2019s first human composting funeral home does it like this: a corpse is placed in a cylinder with organic materials, like wood chips, plants, and straw, then heated and turned repeatedly for several weeks with a hook until it\u2019s broken down into a nutrient-rich soil that can be delivered back to the family or used for planting.\n   Human composting is the latest of a handful of environmental deathcare options to gain traction across the country as available   cemetery space declines and emissions from cremation mount .\n  Before human composting gained traction,   green burials\u2014in which the body is prepared without chemicals and planted underground in an organic, biodegradable container, often underneath a tree sapling\u2014emerged in 1998 as an alternative to traditional high-impact burial methods, according to the   Green Burial Council. Lauded as an environmentally superior deathcare method, it also makes reckoning with death easier for some. It\u2019s a difficult topic, says Jodie Buller, board member of the Conservation Burial Alliance, but knowing that you or a loved one can die sustainably\u2014through composting or green burials\u2014makes it easier to handle.\n  \u201cIt feels like a very peaceful option,\u201d Buller said. \u201cThe idea that the soil that someone becomes then can be used to nourish plants feels really good to people. It helps break down some of that taboo around death and dying.\u201d\n  Oregon\u2019s law, slated to go into effect in July, 2022, follows similar momentum in neighboring states. Washington became the first in the U.S. to legalize natural organic reduction in   2019, which led to the   opening of   Recompose.

 video) and over 100 augmentations. Each modality\u2019s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.\n AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook&#39;s -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you&#39;re working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these &#34;internet user&#34; types of data augmentations are prelevant.\n  To see more examples of augmentations, open the Colab notebooks in the README for each modality! (e.g. image  README &amp;  Colab)\n        Or clone AugLy if you want to be able to run our unit tests, contribute a pull request, etc:\n git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/AugLy.git[Optional, but recommended] conda create -n augly  &amp;&amp; conda activate augly  &amp;&amp; conda install pippip install -e AugLy/\n NOTE: In some environments,  pip doesn&#39;t install  python-magic as expected.

", "note_en": "In the database field and information retrieval in general, there is a very common scenario. I have a list of (sorted) integers that I want to store, and I want to do that in an as efficient a manner as possible. There are dozens of methods to do this and this is a hot topic for research. This is so useful because there are so many places where you can operate on a sorted integer list and gain massive benefits. Unlike generic compression routines, we can usually take advantage of the fact that we understand the data we are trying to work with and get better results.\n The reason I need to compress integers (actually, int64 values) is that I\u2019m trying to keep track of matches for some data, so the integers that I\u2019m tracking are actually file offsets for user\u2019s data inside of Voron. That lead to a few different scenarios that I have to deal with:\n  I\u2019m trying to figure out what is the best way to store the later two options in as efficient manner as possible.\n The first stop was  Daniel Lemire\u2019s blog, naturally, since he has wrote about this extensively. I looked at the following schemes: FastPFor and StreamVByte. They have somewhat different purposes, but basically, FastPFor is using a bits stream while StreamVByte is using byte oriented mode. Theoretically speaking, you can get better compression rate from FastPFor, but StreamVByte is supposed to be faster. Another integer compression system come from the Gorilla paper from Facebook, that is a bigger scheme, which include time series values compression. However, part of that scheme talks about how you can compress integers (they use that to store the ticks of a particular operation). We are actually using that for the time series support inside of RavenDB.\n I\u2019m not going to cover that in depth, here  is the paper on Gorilla compression, the relevant description is at section 4.1.1. Suffice to say that they are using a bit stream and delta of deltas computation. Basically, if you keep getting values that are the same distance apart, you don\u2019t need to record all the value, you can compute that naturally. In the best case scenario, Gorilla compression needs a single bit per value, assuming the results are spaced similarly.\n For my purpose, I want to get as high a compression rate as possible, and I need to store just the list of integers. The problem with Gorilla compression is that if we  aren\u2019t getting numbers that are the same distance apart, we need to record the  amount that they are different. That means that at a minimum, we\u2019ll need a minimum of 9 bits  per value. That adds up quickly, sadly.\n On the other hand, with PFor, there is a different system. PFor computes the maximum number of bits required for a  batch of integer, and then record just those values. I found the Binary Packing section (2.6) in  this paper to be the clearest explanation on how that works exactly.\u00a0 The problem with PFor, however, is that if you have a single large outlier, you\u2019ll waste a lot of bits unnecessarily.\n I decided to see if I can do something about that and created an encoder that works on batches of 128 integers at a time. This encoder will:\n Check the maximum number of bits required to record the  deltas of the integers. That along already saves us a lot.\n Then we check the top and bottom halves of the batch, to see if we\u2019ll get a benefit from recording them separately. A single large value (or a group of them) that is localized to a part of the batch will be recorded independently in this case.\n Finally, instead of only recording the meaningful bit ranges, we\u2019ll also analyze the batch we get further. The idea is to try to find ranges within the batch that have the same distance from one another. We can encode those as repetitions instead of each independent value. That can end up saving a surprisingly amount of space.\n You can look at the results of  my research here. I\u2019ll caution you that this is raw, but the results are promising. I\u2019m able to beat (in terms of compression rate) the standard PFor implementation by a bit, with a  lot less code.\n I\u2019m also looking at a compression rate of 30% \u2013 40% for realistic data sets. And if the data is setup just right and I\u2019m able to take advantage of the repeated delta optimization, I can pack things  real tight.\n Currently numbers say that I can push upward of 10,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer without any repeated deltas. It goes to just under 500,000 int64 values in an 8KB buffer if I can take full advantage of the deltas.\n The reason I mention the delta so often, it is very likely that I\u2019ll record values that are roughly the same size, so we\u2019ll get offsets that are the same space from one another. In that case, my encoder goes to town and the compression rate is basically crazy.\n This is a  small piece of a much larger work, but this is the first time in a while that I got to code at Voron\u2019s level.

[1] The extreme temperatures in Antarctica \rnecessitated large amounts of fuel oil to maintain operations, making \rthe prospect of nuclear power, an attractive alternative. [1] During its \r10 year lifetime, the nuclear power station produced over 78 million \rkilowatt hours of electricity and produced 13 million gallons of fresh \rwater using the excess steam in a desalination plant. [1] Though this \rdevice reduced the necessity for fuel imports, it was plagued with \rproblems which ultimately forced its early retirement in 1972. The cost \rassociated with nuclear power in the Antarctic made it impractical, and \rdiesel-electric generators have since powered the base. [1] The PM-3A \rnuclear reactor that powered McMurdo Station stands as the only nuclear \rpower station to operate on the Antarctic continent.\n    The ice-free southern tip of the Hut Point Peninsula \ron Ross Island in Antarctica has a history of over 100 years of \rexploration and scientific history and is the site of the present day \rMcMurdo Station. [2] This site is located just 729 nautical miles from \rthe South Pole and is where Robert F. Scott staged the first expedition \rto the South Pole in 1902. [2] The United States established a permanent \rbase at this site beginning in December 1955 as part of Operation Deep \rFreeze I. [2] Known as Naval Air Facility McMurdo, this site was to \rserve as a sea port and logistics base from which to build and support a \rresearch facility at the geographic South Pole. [2] The name McMurdo was \rchosen to honour a lieutenant on the British ship HMS Terror that \rdiscovered Ross Island on an Antarctic expedition in 1841. [2] In 1958, \rthe site was renamed to McMurdo Station and has since maintained the \rability to support a population of over 1200 people. [2] McMurdo Station \rserves as the hub for activity in the Antarctic and is currently \roperated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), a division of \rthe Nation Science Foundation (NSF). [2]\n      The decision to install a nuclear power station at \rMcMurdo station was based on several factors. [3] First, there were \rdifficulties associated with supplying the large fuel demands required \rfor operations. Aircraft, diesel-electric generators, heating units, and \rvarious types of land vehicles consumed fuel in excess of half of the \rtotal freight delivered to Antarctica in the late 1950s. [3] To further \rcomplicate supply chain logistics, McMurdo can only be accessed by \rsupply ships during the aural summer months (summer in the southern \rhemisphere), thus requiring all supplies for the entire year to be \rdelivered during this short time frame. [3] It was concluded that an \rincreased supply of electricity from nuclear power would give rise to a \rmore efficient use of freight, reduced costs, as well as electric \rheating to replace the fire hazards associated with oil-fired heating \runits. [3] In addition, experience would be gained from installing and \roperating a nuclear power plant in an isolated and harsh environment. \r[3]\n  In August 1960, the United States Congress authorized \rthe design and construction of a nuclear reactor for McMurdo. [3] That \rsame month, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission contracted the Martin \rMarietta Company of Baltimore, Maryland to design, fabricate, test, \rpackage, transport, install, and initially operate the PM-3A (A for \rAntarctic) nuclear reactor on site in Antarctica. [4] The PM-3A reactor \ris a portable, medium sized nuclear reactor, the third of its type. [4] \rTwo others of this type were built and fielded prior to the PM-3A. [4] \rThe first was the PM-1, also built by Martin, which was used to power a \rremote radar station in Wyoming as part of the North American Aerospace \rDefense Command (NORAD). [4] The PM-2A (A for Arctic) was built by the \rAmerican Locomotive Company to power the remote US military base known \ras Camp Century setup in Northern Greenland. [4] Each of these reactors \rwas in the 1.25-2.0 MW power range, PM-1 and PM-3A were operational by \r1962, with PM-2A being operational in 1960. [4]\n    Fig. 3: Components of the PM-3A arriving at McMurdo. \r (Source:  United States\r Antartcia Program. Courtesy of the\r  NSF)\n  The PM-3A nuclear reactor was above all meant to be \rportable as it was designed with the LC-130 aircraft in mind as its \rdelivery system. [3] Although McMurdo is accessible by ship, it was \roriginally thought that this reactor would power bases inland such as \rthat located at the South Pole which are accessible only by aircraft. \r[3] For reliability and transportability reasons, the PM-3A was designed \rto be a pressurized water reactor. [3] Its core utilized highly enriched \ruranium, 93.1% in relative amount of the isotope U-235, whose fuel \rassembly was roughly the size of an oil drum. [5] Fig. 2 shows the \rinstallation of the PM-3A core onsite. The reactor arrived in modules at \rMcMurdo in December of 1961 by way of the USNS Arneb. [3] Fig. 3 shows \rone of the nuclear reactor modules being unloaded at McMurdo. The PM-3A \rwas assembled on a foundation of solid volcanic rock at an altitude of \r300 feet on the side of Observation Hill, a site that overlooks McMurdo \rStation. [3] Fig. 4 shows the completed reactor site overlooking McMurdo \rStation.\n  The PM-3A was operated by the Naval Nuclear \rPropulsion Unit consisting of a crew of 25. [3] The reactor went \rcritical in March of 1962 and supplied useful electricity to McMurdo in \rJuly of 1962. [3] It took a total of 23 months to complete testing and \rdebugging of the PM-3A nuclear plant. [3] After this time, control of \rthe plant was turned over from the Martin Company to the US Navy. [3] \rOnce fully operational, the role of the plant was twofold, to produce \relectricity for McMurdo in the amount of 1.8 MW as well as to produce \rsteam to operate a desalination plant for the production fresh drinking \rwater in the amount of 14,000 gallons per day. [3]\n    With a total of 438 malfunctions during its \roperational lifetime from 1964 to 1972, the reactor at McMurdo proved to \rbe an unreliable source of power generation, available only 72% of the \rtime. [1] Because of this, in May of 1972, it was determined by an \rindependent assessment from the Bechtel Corporation that the PM-3A was \rnot cost effective and that replacement with modern diesel-electric \rgenerators would require less staff and would also be more reliable. [1] \rIn September 1972, the PM-3A was shut down for routine maintenance and \rinspection. [1] It was determined that conditions existed in the system \rfor chloride stress corrosion cracking, a situation where sudden failure \rcan occur in normally ductile materials under tension in a corrosive \renvironment. [1,6] Inspection of a an accessible section of pipe \rrevealed no incidences of this occurring, however, the Navy refused to \rrule out cracking on surfaces which could not be inspected and thus \rcalled for a full dismantling and inspection of the reactor before it \rcould be deemed safe. [1] The cost associated with this full inspection \rand possible repair of reactor components was a major factor in the \rdecision to decommission the plant. [1]\n    After 10 years of operation, the PM-3A was \rpermanently shut down in 1972, achieving only half of the expected \rdesign life of 20 years. [1] The next step was clean up of the reactor \rsite. The PM-3A and generated radioactive waste could not remain at \rMcMurdo due to the internationally agreed upon Antarctic Treaty which \rprevents both nuclear weapons testing as well as nuclear waste dumping \rin the Antarctic. [7] As such, a large-scale effort was undertaken to \rremove the reactor components, buildings, and contaminated soil for a \rtotal of 365 metric tons of radioactive waste to the continental United \rStates. [7] It was later determined that there were indeed cracks in the \rcontainment vessel which leaked coolant water into the crushed gravel \rthat had been used as the reactor shield which is what resulted in such \ra large area of contamination. [4] As such, more than 9000 cubic meters \rof contaminated soil was relocated to the continental US. [1] In total, \rseven enriched uranium fuel cores were shipped to McMurdo, three of \rwhich had yet to be used as the plant was expected to operate for \rseveral more years. [7] The reactor cores, components, and highly \rradioactive gravel that was used to shield the reactor were shipped to \rthe Department of Energy Savannah River Plant in South Carolina. [1] The \rremaining low-level contaminated soil was shipped to the Naval base at \rPort Hueneme, California. [1] The clean up operation lasted until 1979 \ras work on the site could be performed only during the austral summer. \r[7]\n    As a result of the multiple malfunctions of the PM-3A \ras well as it&#39;s clean up activities, there have been concerns that the \rhealth of personnel involved with the reactor may have been adversely \raffected. [7] Although members of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Unit were \rcontinuously monitored for radiation, many of the military support crew \rwere not. [7] As such, a study was undertaken by the Department of \rDefense to estimate an upper bound on radiation exposure for these \rindividuals based on the worst cases of the available data from McMurdo. \r[7] Levels of radioactivity in the water were monitored once the PM-3A \rwas used in the production of drinking water. [7] During the first few \ryears of fresh water production (between 1967 and 1969) there were \rseveral instances of abnormally high amounts of tritium in the drinking \rwater. [7] In addition, there was a case of abnormally high amounts of \rlong-lived beta activity in the drinking water in 1969. [7]\n    In addition to problems with the drinking water and \renvironmental contamination, there were several recorded instances of \rcrew radiation exposure, some resulting in injury. [7] During the plant \roperation, 223 reports of abnormal levels of radiation were recorded. \r[7] Of these cases, 14 resulted in injury and 123 resulted in exposure \rin the amount of 0.350 rem over a period of 7 days. [7] This is a \rsubstantial amount of radiation when it is estimated that, one average, \ra typical yearly dose from background sources is 0.240 rem. [8] The \rremaining 86 instances were abnormal radiation levels detected within \rthe plant and its immediate surroundings. [7] The conclusion was that a \rsupport member would have received a maximum dose of 0.2 to 0.6 rem to \rthe thyroid or 0.2 to 0.5 rem to the red bone marrow per austral summer \rtour. [7] The upper bound here is equivalent a typical radiation dosage \rreceived by a person living in the United States from typical background \rradiation and medical procedures. [7] It is, however, recognized that \rthere were personnel who may have been exposed to radiation outside the \rconfines of factors and data considered in those figures that may be \religible for compensation. [7] In addition, the estimated dose above \rdoes not include members who were part of the decommissioning procedures \rwho may have inhaled or ingested contaminated particles. [7]\n    The nuclear reactor installed at McMurdo Station was \rthe first and only to operate on the Antarctic continent. It operated \rfor 10 years and greatly reduced the need for fossil fuels in the \rAntarctic. Although it was initially thought to be a cost saving device, \rits unreliability, large operational crew, and large clean up proved it \rto be an expensive experiment.

People who claim this have fallen for Brave\u2019s marketing strategy which consists on telling lies and flawed arguments.\n I\u2019ll give you numerous facts and counter-arguments that will prevent yourself from falling for Brave\u2019s lies.\n   One of the biggest Brave\u2019s selling points is their built-in adblocker. But let me tell you a couple of things about Brave\u2019s adblocker:\n Their adblocker is just a fork of uBlock Origin, which isn\u2019t necessarily bad. The problem comes when you realise that  it has a hardcoded whitelist. They\u2019re   whitelisting trackers from Facebook and Twitter, so they can use scripts in third parties&#39; websites to track you across the web. This was their response:\n Loading a script from an edge-cache does not track a user without third-party cookies or equivalent browser-local storage, which Brave always blocks and always will block. In other words, sending requests and receiving responses without cookies or other means of identifying users does not necessarily create a tracking threat.\n This is completely false. They\u2019re blatantly lying to their users. Anyone who knows a bit about how JavaScript works and it\u2019s capacities to track you without the need of using cookies will be laughing after reading that.\n Using Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s scripts is more than enough to track and identify you. Blocking cookies doesn\u2019t help.\n I mean, what\u2019s the point on making a \u201cprivate\u201d browser if Facebook\u2019s scripts (that are everywhere btw) will track you?\n Another problem with their built-in adblocker is that it\u2019s better for extensions to be separated from the core of the browser, since they don\u2019t follow each other\u2019s update cycles.  This means that you need to update the entire browser to fix a bug in the adblocker. Stupid, isn\u2019t it?\n Another reason to avoid using Brave is that   uBlock Origin works best on Firefox and there isn\u2019t anything that Brave can do about it.\n The limitations are Chromium\u2019s fault and Google isn\u2019t going to do anything about it. Brave is dependent on Google and they\u2019ll always be limited by this fact. Since they\u2019re based on Google\u2019s browser and web engine, Google takes development decisions over the 95% of Brave. It\u2019s important to bring focus to the fact that  Brave isn\u2019t more than Chromium with another skin and a built-in adblocker with reduced functionality.\n Other side effect of using a browser which is made by Google is that  Google will take decisions that benefit their advertisement business, like   making impossible to use adblockers on any Chromium based browser. And of course, this will affect Brave.\n However, of course that  they won\u2019t tell you anything of this on their homepage. Part of their marketing strategy consists on making their \u201cprivacy shield\u201d look like the best and unrivaled adblocker in the world, when it is just a really limited uBlock Origin, with a hardcoded whitelist.\n  Rewards is their shitty program that will replace ads displayed on websites with their own. They claim that you can earn money with it. Well, they aren\u2019t lying to you on this. If earning half a penny in a month is okay for you, in exchange of your privacy, because of course, they\u2019re tracking you with Rewards, then enjoy your money. But remember, Brave\u2019s fee is 30% of your earnings.\n If you don\u2019t mind that and you decide to use Rewards, it\u2019s important to say that Rewards uses Uphold, which has an excellent policy /s:\n To verify your identity, we collect your name, address, phone, email, and other similar information. We may also require you to provide additional Personal Data for verification purposes, including your date of birth, taxpayer or government identification number, or a copy of your government-issued identification\n Uphold uses Veriff to verify your identity by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your government-issued identification. Veriff\u2019s facial recognition technology collects information from your photos that may include biometric data, and when you provide your selfie, you will be asked to agree that Veriff may process biometric data and other data (including special categories of data) from the photos you submit and share it with Uphold. Automated processes may be used to make a verification decision.\n Contrary to popular belief, Rewards isn\u2019t opt in. Don\u2019t believe me? Check it yourself.  Brave will recurrently make requests to the following domains, no matter if you use Rewards or not:\n  The names can be a bit confusing but these domains aren\u2019t just for updates and  they fetch affiliates for Brave Rewards, with pings such as Grammarly, Softonic, Uphold, etc.\n So  despite explicitly opting out, Brave\u2019s Rewards will still be used to track you.\n  They also make requests to various domains that are believed to be related to the crypto aspect of Rewards. I won\u2019t elaborate here since it\u2019s better explained on  this article. Here you have a list with the different domains that Brave sends a request to:\n   It is also worth mentioning that  Brave has built-in telemetry.  Brave will make a ton of requests to the domain p3a.brave.com as telemetry. This telemetry can be opted out, but a lot of people believe in their marketing and think that Brave is private out of the box.\n  brave-core-ext.s3.brave.com fetches 5 extensions and installs them. It is said that this might be a backdoor. But I don\u2019t want to get conspiracist. I prefer giving you verifiable facts. I\u2019ll limit myself to inform you about suspicious activities.\n  There is a ton of criticism about Firefox\u2019s Pocket. But Brave has something similar, which is called Brave Today.\n It is displayed in every blank tab. This feature sends lots of requests to Brave\u2019s servers.  It can\u2019t be disabled.\n So your only option would be setting the tabs to blank, but you\u2019ll still have this shady crap enabled. At least on Firefox you can easily disable Pocket.\n  This features is intended to \u201cprotect\u201d the user from \u201cunsafe\u201d websites and extensions. However, it seems to have a contrary effect, since  it sends requests to fetch the information required And it wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched of Brave  to use Google\u2019s SafeBrowsing. I\u2019ll elaborate on the next section.\n  Brave makes requests to static1.brave.com. If you put this on a browser you\u2019ll find that it was directed to Google\u2019s error 404 page.\n Isn\u2019t it weird that one of Brave\u2019s domains redirects to a Google\u2019s page? Well, curl \u2013head static1.brave.com shows that  Brave uses Google\u2019s gstatic, which is btw using Cloudflare.\n It\u2019s a concerning issue for a \u201cprivacy\u201d oriented browser to connect to Cloudflare\u2019s and Google\u2019s domains, since both of them are telemetry.\n  Well, you have to understand that security and privacy are different things. Anyway, It is true that Chromium has process isolation. However, Firefox is almost there too. It\u2019s known as the Project Fission. You can already enable it on the about:config with fission.autostart (on nightly). Take into account that it\u2019s still under development.\n Process isolation is the only advantage in security that chromium has over Firefox right now and it will not help you with privacy. You may even want to enable Fission if you feel like process isolation is a must have.\n  Brave will check for updates every time you run it.  You can\u2019t turn it off, which implies that Brave\u2019ll make this request every time you launch the browser. Brave\u2019s dedication to privacy is truly amazing /s.\n  Okay, we\u2019ve seen how Brave is everything but private. But I\u2019d still like to list you some of the shady practices they\u2019ve been caught doing in the past, just in case there is someone who still thinks that using Brave is a good idea.\n  In June 2020, a twitter user (@cryptonator1337) discovered that  Brave was automatically injecting referral codes into URLs for cryptocurrency exchange sites.\n So if you typed \u201cbinance.us\u201d into the URL bar and pressed enter, Brave would take you to \u201cbinance.us/?ref=35089877\u201d.\n There was a huge scandal when this was noted. Later, Brave disabled this in the code, in a \u201csorry we got caught\u201d style.\n  I\u2019ve already shown you how Uphold is everything but privacy respecting.  It wouldn\u2019t make any sense for a \u201cprivacy friendly\u201d browser to use such a service, unless they didn\u2019t give a fuck about privacy and everything was just a marketing strategy\u2026\n  Who the fuck implements Tor but doesn\u2019t change the DNS? I mean, this is either total incompetence or, even worse, malevolence on the part of Brave\u2019s team.\n   Brave have been accused of  scamming people. They\u2019ve been promoting this on their home screen, since they get up to $200 per user that uses their affiliate link. I consider this a scam since they\u2019re making a ton of profit from people who will lose their money.  They removed the Reddit post exposing this and the issue on Github.\n They were also accused of theft with BAT but this isn\u2019t verifiable so I\u2019ll only link the  source for you.\n  You may have seen in the past a fork of Brave which removed telemetry and other shady practices from Brave. It was called Braver.\n Well, that project was given countless lawsuits by Brave, they were forced to rename the project and finally they had to give up out of fear.\n So, after all, it seems that  being free software, or as they prefer to call it, \u201copen source\u201d,  is just another marketing strategy.\n They don\u2019t care at all about software freedom and when someone forks their browser and make one that doesn\u2019t spy on their users, they will harass them until the fork dies, since people using forks aren\u2019t profitable. They want you to use Brave so they can sell your data, force you to use affiliate links and take a 30% cut of your \u201crewards\u201d.\n  I think that at this point it\u2019s clear that Brave doesn\u2019t care about users&#39; privacy, they only care about making money. But there is something that I haven\u2019t talked about. It\u2019s the fact that Brave is supporting Google\u2019s web monopoly.\n Why? How? Well, the answer is pretty simple: Brave is just another Chromium skin. So at the end, when using Brave or any other Chromium based browser, you\u2019re giving marketshare to Google and supporting their evil web empire.\n The only browser that does not use Google\u2019s web engine (blink)  is Firefox. So if you really want some kind of privacy I\u2019d recommend you switching to Firefox or something Firefox based, like GNU Icecat, since a Google\u2019s monopoly on the browsers market can\u2019t be good for anyone, even if you love Chromium, it is known that monopolies are extremely negative.\n And as I mentioned before,  this is already happening with Google trying to destroy adblockers. What will be next? Forcing every Chromium browser to use FLOC? Making it impossible to disable JavaScript? We don\u2019t know it yet, but depending on the biggest data miner and advertisement company (Google) development decisions doesn\u2019t seem a great idea if you want to have some kind of privacy.\n  You shouldn\u2019t trust Brave at all. The smart move would be switching to  hardened Firefox, GNU Icecat, Palemoon or the Tor browser.\n If you have any counter-argument, any other info that I could add to the blog post or anything to say about it, you can reach me on the fediverse.\n   &gt;&gt; Home", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:07:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9519\u8bef,false", "title": "\u52c7\u6562\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u611f\u89c9 ", "title_en": "Brave, the false sensation of privacy", "transed": 1, "url": "http://ebin.city/%7Ewerwolf/posts/brave-is-shit/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9519\u8bef", "false"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "85eef9feb4631daca7a8e01470161dd5.png", "infoid": 1066695, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a33\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u4ece\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8bc1\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u662f\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f29\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6216\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fc7\u6e21\u9700\u8981\u514b\u670d\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4fdd\u7f57\u9677\u9631\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e40 CA +\u5149\u5b66\u8ddd\u79bb\u768419\u82f1\u5bf8\u673a\u67b6\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bb8\u591a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u7535\u6c14\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5806\u6808\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ad9\u70b9\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5355\u53cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bfb\u5740\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f20\u9012\u7684M\u00f8lmer-s\u00f8rensen\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u7f20\u7ed3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u751f\u4ea7\u6700\u5927\u7f20\u7ed5\u7684\u7eff\u9e42-Horne-Zeininger\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8fbe24\u4e2a\u79bb\u7ebf\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f;\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76f8\u63d0\u5e76\u8bba\u3002\n  12\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7269\u7406\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u768412.0\u7a0e\u6536\u6761\u6b3e4.0\u56fd\u9645\u8bb8\u53ef\u3002\u6b64\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u914d\u5fc5\u987b\u7ef4\u6301\u5411\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\u548c\u7b2c39\u6761\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u671f\u520a\u5f15\u6587\u548cDOI\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002\n   \u00d7\n     \u6ca1\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u83b7\u5f97\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u6216\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u521b\u610f\u516c\u51714.0\u56fd\u9645\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u4f55\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\uff0c\u5b89\u5fb7\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4ea4\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f52\u5c5e\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u7ae0\uff06\uff0339;\u51a0\u519b\uff0c\u671f\u520a\u5f15\u6587\u548cDoi\u4ee4\u4eba\u7740\u8ff7\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6570\u5b57\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u88ab\u5176\u4ed6\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7eb3\u5165\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u60a8\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u662f\u5728\u804c\u6743\u6301\u6709\u4eba\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u8bb8\u53ef\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n \u00d7 ", "note_en": "Quantum information processing is steadily progressing from a purely academic discipline towards applications throughout science and industry. Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of quantum information processing hardware is an important step in this process. However, the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments. This transition requires overcoming challenges in engineering and integration without sacrificing the state-of-the-art performance of laboratory implementations. Here, we present a 19-inch rack quantum computing demonstrator based on     40  Ca + optical qubits in a linear Paul trap to address many of these challenges. We outline the mechanical, optical, and electrical subsystems. Furthermore, we describe the automation and remote access components of the quantum computing stack. We conclude by describing characterization measurements relevant to quantum computing including site-resolved single-qubit interactions, and entangling operations mediated by the M\u00f8lmer-S\u00f8rensen interaction delivered via two distinct addressing approaches. Using this setup, we produce maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 24 ions without the use of postselection or error mitigation techniques; on par with well-established conventional laboratory setups.\n  12 More   Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

I attended a university where they severely restricted student organizations from directly getting donations. The university policy was that donors can either donate to the university and get the tax deduction, or donate to the student organizations and  not get the tax deductions, but they can&#39;t donate to both and still get the university&#39;s tax deduction.\n The amount of student organizations at that university tumbled down hard because the university was also tight-fisted with giving money to those organizations, especially the more cash-heavy engineering organizations where they can&#39;t run enough bake sales and other cutesy stuff to cover their expenses. I&#39;m pretty sure the only ones that got their full needed funding were the ones that could run on minimal budget or generated lots of positive publicity.\n The biggest joke I&#39;ve seen was when that university gave a brand new SAE Formula Hybrid collegiate team about $3000, and stipulated that they would only get more funding if that team successfully competes that same year&#39;s national competition.\n I know for the regular SAE Formula, you need a minimum of $50K to even get a vehicle to pass through the tech inspections.\n They also gave a few hundred dollars to a solar car team. That team of course ceased to exist when they ran out of money just building the frame, which other student engineering organizations promptly cannibalized the parts for their own projects.\n EDIT: I recall seeing one student org that broke away from the university to run as an independent org so they could get sponsor donations. Of course that meant they couldn&#39;t recruit on university grounds, partake in university events, use the university&#39;s rooms or shared spaces for meetings, use the university&#39;s machine shop or ask the university&#39;s faculty staff for advice.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:06:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "reddit,removed,\u5927\u5b66",

", "note_en": "The simplicity but excellent mobility of snakes makes them an ideal creature for roboticists to emulate, but it also yields robots that are downright creepy. Making things worse, researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Georgia Tech, have made a   snakebot that can burrow underground so we\u2019ll never see it coming.\n  To date, we\u2019ve managed to engineer robots and autonomous creatures that can handle almost any terrain, be it rolling across the   rocky surface of Mars,   diving below the waves,   soaring through the sky, or even   deftly tackling a flight of stairs. Where robots have yet to explore is underground. We\u2019re not talking about spelunking through a cavernous subterranean cave, but instead burrowing and forging their own path through sand and soil like countless of Mother Nature\u2019s creations do.\n We\u2019ve seen   snakebots before, but the   researchers at UCSB and Georgia Tech have created a new design with several key upgrades that allow it to more easily dig through granular materials all on its own. Unlike other   snakebots, this version is what\u2019s considered a soft body robot because, as the name implies, it forgoes rigid parts for flexible materials that make it lighter and more adaptable because it can more easily bend, twist, and contort its body.\n    One of the biggest challenges of burrowing through any material is the friction created, and having to overcome it. So the researchers took more inspiration from nature and copied the mechanism plants use to dig deep into the soil by growing only from the tip, leaving the rest of the root stationary. The snakebot does the same thing, growing only from the end of the bot so the rest of its body doesn\u2019t actually move at all, eliminating a major source of friction. If you\u2019ve ever struggled to pull a root out of the ground, it\u2019s because you\u2019re fighting against the friction of its entire length abrading against the surrounding soil.\n   The snakebot\u2019s perpetually growing tip still requires a certain level of force to push sand and soil out of its way while it digs, but the research team once again found inspiration in nature to make this task easier for their bot. Like the southern sand octopus which shoots a jet of water into the ocean floor to loosen sand so it can bury itself as a protective defense mechanism, the snakebot fires a blast of air ahead of it to create a fluidized version of sand and soil that\u2019s easier to push through.\n   By combining a wedged-shape \u2018head\u2019 with a blast of air directed slightly downwards, the snakebot loosens the soil ahead of, and below it, to reduce forces that naturally occur in granular materials that tend to push larger objects towards the surface. It not only makes it easier for the snakebot to dig, but it also makes it easier to remain underground as it burrows.\n  Besides giving the world one more source of anxiety, the burrowing snakebot does have some genuinely useful applications, and not just giving the militaries of the world an autonomous weapon that can burrow beneath walls, barbed wire, fields of land mines, and other obstacles. While the rovers we\u2019ve sent to Mars are equipped with drills, there\u2019s far more to be learned about neighboring planets by digging much deeper beneath their surfaces. It could even be a useful tool for archeology, letting scientists explore a site without having to disturb what\u2019s on the surface until something needs to be unearthed.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 21:06:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u73b0\u5728,snakebots,\u6316\u6398", "title": "\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\uff0c\u86c7\u5200\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u6316\u6d1e\u5730\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u6765\u4e86 ", "title_en": "Great, Snakebots Can Now Burrow Underground So We'll Never See Them Coming", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/great-snakebots-can-now-burrow-underground-so-well-nev-1847120499", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u73b0\u5728", "snakebots", "\u6316\u6398"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "16c013f7c3f42c736c27342c6be5ce3a.jpg", "infoid": 1066692, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339;\u4f60\u7684\u67d0\u4e00\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f60\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u60f3\u8c61\uff08\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u6210\u5e74\uff0c\u5efa\u9020\uff09\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u62f1\u5eca\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u91d1\u8272\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u800c80s\u65f6\u4ee3\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u7528\u7684\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u5bbf\u820d\uff0c\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u591a\u4eba\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u55b7\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u67dc\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7684\u65e7\u5b66\u6821\u6e38\u620f\u68a6\u60f3\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u66f4\u5927\u548c\u7b28\u91cd\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f39\u7403\uff1f\u76f4\u5230\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u60a8\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8981\u4e48\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e00\u5806\u539f\u59cb\u5f39\u7403\u67dc\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u540e\u8005\u88ab\u5f39\u7403\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u611f\u89c9\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u3002\n \u6211\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5728\u6e38\u620f - \u6000\u65e7\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u9700\u8981\u591a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u50cfArcade1up\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u9500\u552e\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u67dc\u4f9b\u5bb6\u7528\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u5236\u9020\u5546\u751f\u4ea7\u5f39\u7403\u591a\u4e2a\u5236\u9020\u5546\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u663e\u7136\u7684\u3002 Arcade1up\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4eca\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f39\u7403\u4eff\u771f\u67dc\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002\n  \u611f\u8c22Arcade1up\uff0cI\uff06\uff0339;

One useful path to making this a reality, especially in tighter quarters, is the &#34;multicade,&#34; an invention that squishes multiple games into a single cabinet.\n But what if your old-school gaming dreams revolve around something bigger and bulkier, particularly pinball? Until recently, your options were either buying a bunch of original pinball cabinets or building your own ground-up emulation solution. And the latter is complicated by the realities of how pinball plays and feels.\n I&#39;ve wondered how long it would take for that to change in the gaming-nostalgia market, especially as companies like Arcade1Up produce and sell more multicade cabinets for home use. The time for change is now, evidently, thanks to a handful of manufacturers producing pinball multicades.\u00a0 Arcade1Up in particular launched three distinct pinball emulation cabinets this year, each revolving around a different license.\n  Thanks to Arcade1Up, I&#39;ve gone hands-on with arguably the most interesting product in its 2021 pinball line: a collection of 10 classic tables, all created by Williams during its  arcade heyday but emulated for more convenient home play. What exactly does $600 get you in terms of emulation and build quality?      (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through  affiliate programs.)\nThe Arcade1Up pinball system is largely the same across all three models released this year. Most of the physical cabinet is preassembled inside its box, and finishing the construction\u2014which resembles a classic pinball machine, complete with buttons and a plunger\u2014is simple enough with a standard screwdriver. The biggest catch will be getting the cabinet&#39;s biggest, heaviest piece through doors or over stairs. This portion measures 34 inches long, 17 inches wide, and 16.5 inches tall. (Luckily, you can unscrew this base chunk in a pinch.) Once fully built, this cabinet&#39;s tallest backplate gets up to 60 inches in height, while the default legs bring the flippers up 35 inches from the floor. These include twistable feet that you can adjust to even out the set&#39;s balance. At roughly 65 percent the size of a standard pinball cabinet, the Arcade1Up version will more likely fit in your favorite playroom, though it looks better in isolation rather than sitting next to an official table of the era.\n    Peek over the fake coin doors, and you&#39;ll quickly see where Arcade1Up&#39;s system differs hugely from the real thing: a 24-inch LCD panel, offset by a significant bezel all around (wood on top and bottom, aluminum on the left and right). Beneath the screen, Arcade1Up relies on an Android-fueled SoC, which pumps a 720p video signal to the screen, along with an analog receiver for the plunger, an accelerometer to sense your real-life &#34;tilts,&#34; and four solenoids that thump along with your gameplay. Two of them are positioned near the flipper buttons to replicate the sense of striking a pinball, while two fit deeper inside the chassis to replicate midgame bumps.\n With the backplate attached and a single AC adapter plugged into a wall outlet, the machine is ready to rock. Part of the kit offers two crucial pieces to the pinball-emulation puzzle: a smaller LCD screen, which provides score information and midgame animations, and a pair of surprisingly robust speakers.\n  The backplate, by the way, is a printed poster that doesn&#39;t change regardless of which virtual game you&#39;re playing.  My cabinet highlights the original Williams table  Attack From Mars, while Arcade1Up&#39;s two other 2021 models are decorated with   Star Wars and  Marvel characters, respectively. Sadly, for the  Attack From Mars cabinet, Arcade1Up didn&#39;t get a great source for the side cabinet art (especially on the backplate&#39;s sides). Those images are a bit warped and low-res. Should your default home arcade have dim lighting, you may not even notice.\n Power the system on, and after an admittedly overlong loading screen, Arcade1Up&#39;s interface pops up, revealing a selection of 10 games as powered by Zen Studios&#39; digital-pinball ecosystem. The Williams machine I tested includes the following:\n  Should you purchase either of the other two 2021 models, you&#39;ll get 10 virtual tables created by Zen Studios for previously released console and PC game collections, as opposed to recreations of real-life classics. That&#39;s why I requested this model in particular.
