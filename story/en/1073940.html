Heading from New Zealand, the expedition ship  Discovery anchored off the coastline of the unknown land under the leadership of Captain Robert Falcon Scott. He chose the Anglo-Irish ex-Merchant Navy Third Officer, Ernest Shackleton, to lead the first hazardous sledge journey inland over slippery surfaces at temperatures as low as minus 62 degrees Fahrenheit. They aimed to make history by breaking the furthest South record towards the bottom of planet Earth.</p><p>20世纪初，英国皇家地理学会鼓励皇家海军支持英国南极探险队。探险船“发现号”从新西兰出发，在船长罗伯特·法尔肯·斯科特的带领下，停泊在这片未知土地的海岸线上。他选择了英国-爱尔兰前商船海军三副欧内斯特·沙克尔顿（Ernest Shackleton）在零下62华氏度的湿滑地面上带领第一次危险的雪橇内陆之旅。他们的目标是创造历史，打破地球最南端的记录。</p><p> Both men succeeded separately, over the next ten years in hellish conditions, to open the way to the South Pole. Scott became famous through the courageous manner of his death and Shackleton through his remarkable 18-month survival story, which ended when his ship, the  Endurance, sank. He died in January 1922, 100 years ago, on another Antarctic voyage.</p><p>在接下来的十年里，两人在地狱般的条件下分别成功地开辟了通往南极的道路。斯科特因其英勇的死亡方式而出名，沙克尔顿则因其非凡的18个月生存故事而出名，故事在他的“耐力号”沉没时结束。他于100年前的1922年1月在另一次南极航行中去世。</p><p>  When cocooned in the darkness for months on end, many on Antarctic expeditions have lost their minds. This is no surprise, especially for those experiencing it for the first time. It is not only dark, cold and claustrophobic, but being marooned on a mysterious land thousands of miles away from civilization can be difficult to get your head around. These pressures would take their toll on even the most hardened of individuals. Indeed, on the  Belgica expedition, the crew succumbed to a mix of scurvy and “cabin fever.”</p><p>当连续数月被困在黑暗中时，许多参加南极考察的人已经失去了理智。这并不奇怪，尤其是对于那些第一次经历这种情况的人来说。这里不仅黑暗、寒冷、幽闭恐怖，而且被困在离文明数千英里的神秘土地上也很难让你动脑。这些压力甚至会对最坚强的人造成伤害。事实上，在贝尔吉卡远征中，船员们死于坏血病和“机舱热”</p><p>   Even those on the  Discovery who kept their sanity found the conditions difficult. As temperatures outside dropped to as low as minus 62 degrees Fahrenheit, most decided to stay on board, but even then, ice still formed on the cabin walls. In these uncomfortable conditions, many of the men grew homesick, while being trapped in the same place and seeing the same people, for months on end, quickly began to grate. Any natural tendency to irritation, depression, pessimism or worry was magnified and, in the absence of loved ones, the natural, indeed the safest, outlets for pent-up feelings were diaries and letters home. That’s human nature, and even more so on an expedition where sensibilities can become extreme.</p><p>即使是那些在探索中保持理智的人也发现情况很困难。当外面的温度降到零下62华氏度时，大多数人决定留在船上，但即便如此，舱壁上仍然结冰。在这种不舒服的环境下，许多人开始想家，同时被困在同一个地方，看到了同样的人，连续几个月，很快就开始感到厌烦。任何一种天生的恼怒、抑郁、悲观或担忧的倾向都会被放大，在没有亲人的情况下，压抑情绪的自然、甚至是最安全的发泄方式就是写日记和给家里写信。这是人类的天性，在一次情感可能变得极端的探险中更是如此。</p><p>   I found on my first expedition south that forced togetherness breeds dissension and even hatred between individuals and groups. Because of this, at times, I found it very difficult to interact with my fellow teammates Oliver Shepard and Charlie Burton. Some days, without a word being spoken, I knew that I disliked one or both of the other men, and I could tell that the feeling was mutual. I was, however, very fortunate that at base I had Ginny to keep me company, who was always a tremendous comfort and support. With my wife by my side, I could at least let off some steam to her; failing that, I would vent my spleen in my diary. It is quite funny now, looking back, as some of my gripes were so inconsequential, but at the time they felt like major disagreements.</p><p>在我第一次南下探险时，我发现强迫的团结会在个人和团体之间滋生分歧，甚至仇恨。正因为如此，有时我发现很难与队友奥利弗·谢泼德和查理·伯顿互动。有些日子，我一句话也没说，我知道我不喜欢其中一个或两个男人，我可以看出这种感觉是相互的。然而，我很幸运，在基地我有金妮陪伴，她总是给我极大的安慰和支持。有妻子在身边，我至少可以向她发泄一下；如果做不到这一点，我会在日记中发泄我的愤怒。现在回想起来，这很有趣，因为我的一些抱怨是如此无足轻重，但当时它们感觉像是重大的分歧。</p><p>  In those dark winter months, with the wind howling outside, Clarence Hare, Scott’s steward and the youngest man on board, revealed there were frequently quarrels and fights among the crewmen. This was where Shackleton truly came into his own.</p><p>在那阴暗的冬季，外面风呼啸，斯科特的乘务员、船上最年轻的人克拉伦斯·黑尔透露，船员之间经常发生争吵和打架。这就是沙克尔顿真正实现自我的地方。</p><p> In charge of the ship’s entertainment, he had ensured that the library was stocked with books while he helped put on plays and even arranged debates, going head to head with Bernacchi over the poetic merits of Browning and Tennyson, with Shackleton arguing for Browning. The crew eventually voted for Tennyson, albeit by a single vote.</p><p>他负责船上的娱乐活动，在他帮助上演戏剧、甚至安排辩论的同时，确保图书馆藏书，并与伯纳基就布朗宁和丁尼生的诗意价值进行了正面交锋，沙克尔顿则为布朗宁辩护。船员们最终投了丁尼生一票，尽管只投了一票。</p><p> Perhaps Shackleton’s greatest contribution to keeping the crew occupied and entertained was the  South Polar Times. In the sanctuary of an “office” that was boxed off in the hold, Shackleton sought to publish this journal once a month, inviting the crew to submit any scientific articles, stories, poems, drawings or jokes. Wilson’s illustrations featured heavily, as did Barne’s caricatures of the crew, while Shackleton always found time to contribute a poem, written under the pseudonym Nemo, the hero of Jules Verne’s  Twenty Thousand Leagues under  the Sea. Calling one of his poems “To the Great Barrier,” in it he alluded to uncovering the mysteries of Antarctica:</p><p>也许沙克尔顿对让船员们忙碌和娱乐的最大贡献是《南极时报》。沙克尔顿在一间被关在船舱里的“办公室”的避难所里，试图每月出版一次这本杂志，邀请船员提交任何科学文章、故事、诗歌、图画或笑话。威尔逊的插图和巴恩对船员的漫画都很重要，而沙克尔顿总是抽出时间写一首诗，化名尼莫，朱尔斯·凡尔纳的《海底两万里》中的英雄。他把自己的一首诗称为“到大堡礁”，其中暗指要揭开南极洲的奥秘：</p><p>  This year shall your icy fastness resound with the voices of men, Shall we learn that you come from the mountains? Shall we call you a frozen sea? Shall we sail Northward and leave you, still a Secret for ever to be?</p><p>今年，你冰冷的牢房将回荡着人类的声音，我们是否将得知你来自群山？我们可以称你为冰海吗？我们向北航行，离开你，这将永远是一个秘密吗？</p><p> There were also plenty of other things to keep the crew entertained. In the privacy of a small cabin, the men could “sport the oak” (contemporary public-school terminology for masturbation), and food was always something to look forward to. This was particularly true for the officers, as Scott did all that he could to make mealtimes an event, with fine china and engraved cutlery being set out in the wardroom.</p><p>还有很多其他事情可以让船员们开心。在一间小木屋的私密空间里，男人们可以“玩橡树”（当代公立学校手淫的术语），食物总是让人期待的东西。警官们尤其如此，因为斯科特竭尽所能让用餐时间成为一项活动，在更衣室里摆放着精美的瓷器和雕刻的餐具。</p><p>  Shackleton himself could also be relied upon as a great source of entertainment, always eager to share stories or a joke. A deckhand wrote, “He was a very nice gentleman, always ready to have a yarn with us.” As had always been the case, he could mix with anybody and was liked by most.</p><p>沙克尔顿本人也可以被视为一个伟大的娱乐来源，总是渴望分享故事或笑话。一名水手写道：“他是一位非常好的绅士，随时准备和我们一起畅谈。”像往常一样，他可以和任何人交往，并且受到大多数人的喜爱。</p><p>  One of the crew that Shackleton especially enjoyed spending time with was 27-year-old Frank Wild. After eleven years in the Merchant Navy, Wild had enlisted in the Royal Navy just a year previously but, craving adventure, had signed up for the expedition. In this respect, he was very similar to Shackleton and it was easy to see why they got on so well. But it was still with Wilson that Shackleton spent most of his time. After a meteorological observatory had been set up on nearby Crater Hill, both men volunteered to regularly take the readings, even if it meant climbing the hill in the darkness and bitter cold.</p><p>沙克尔顿特别喜欢与27岁的弗兰克·怀尔德共度时光。在商船海军服役11年后，怀尔德仅在一年前加入了皇家海军，但由于渴望冒险，他报名参加了探险队。在这方面，他和沙克尔顿非常相似，很容易理解为什么他们相处得这么好。但沙克尔顿大部分时间还是和威尔逊在一起。在附近的火山口山上建立了一个气象观测站后，两人自愿定期记录读数，即使这意味着要在黑暗和严寒中爬山。</p><p> Shackleton explained, “We want to do as much exercise . . . as possible, and this will be a useful way of so doing.” This no doubt allowed them some welcome time away from the ship, from which the always patient Wilson had previously complained “there is absolutely no escape,” but it also had a far greater purpose: for Shackleton to prove to Scott that he should be selected as part of his team to go south when the summer finally commenced.</p><p>沙克尔顿解释说：“我们想做尽可能多的运动……这将是一种非常有用的方式。”毫无疑问，这让他们有了一段受欢迎的离开船的时间，一直耐心的威尔逊此前曾抱怨说“绝对无法逃脱”，但这也有一个更大的目的：让沙克尔顿向斯科特证明，他应该被选为他的团队的一员，在夏天终于开始时去南方。</p><p> Places to join Scott on his expedition south were highly coveted; it was for this reason that many of the men had signed up in the first place. There was no one more willing than Shackleton. He certainly was not there just to make up the numbers. From the time he told tall tales to his sisters about becoming a famed hero he had dreamed of an opportunity like this. Now, it was within touching distance—as long as Scott selected him.</p><p>加入斯科特南部探险队的地方备受垂涎；正是因为这个原因，许多人一开始就报名了。没有人比沙克尔顿更愿意。他当然不只是为了编造数字。从他向姐妹们讲述成为著名英雄的故事起，他就一直梦想着这样的机会。现在，只要斯科特选中他，距离就很近。</p><p>   When selecting team members for my own polar expeditions, I always tried to choose confident, highly capable individuals who, although not “yes” men, would not threaten my status as leader. It’s a difficult mix. While you need people who can think and act quickly under pressure, you don’t want to have to deal with any attempted mutinies on the ice. Sometimes, it’s impossible to tell how people will react until they’re tested in some of the harshest conditions known to man.</p><p>在为我自己的极地探险队挑选队员时，我总是试图挑选自信、能力强的人，他们虽然不是“唯命是从”的人，但不会威胁到我作为领导者的地位。这是一个困难的组合。虽然你需要能够在压力下快速思考和行动的人，但你不想不得不处理任何试图在冰上发生的叛乱。有时，在人类已知的最恶劣条件下进行测试之前，不可能知道人们会做出怎样的反应。</p><p> Scott, therefore, had a difficult decision to make, particularly as he favoured taking only one other person with him. In this he had been inspired by Fridtjof Nansen, whose famed north polar wanderings had been undertaken with only one companion. With just one place up for grabs, Armitage was the strong favorite. He had actually been promised a place on the main southerly journey right from the outset, hence why he took the position as Scott’s second-in-command. However, as time had passed, Scott had slowly but surely grown to depend on the solid character of Edward Wilson. Having already proven himself on the ice, Wilson was also intelligent and good company. Furthermore, he was a doctor, which could prove vital on such a hazardous journey.</p><p>因此，斯科特做出了一个艰难的决定，尤其是因为他喜欢只带一个人。在这方面，他受到了弗里德乔夫·南森（Fridtjof Nansen）的启发，他著名的北极漫游是在只有一个同伴的情况下进行的。由于只有一个名额可供争夺，阿米蒂奇是最受欢迎的。事实上，他从一开始就被承诺在主要的南风之旅中占有一席之地，因此他成为斯科特的副手。然而，随着时间的推移，斯科特慢慢但肯定地开始依赖爱德华·威尔逊的坚强性格。威尔逊已经在冰上证明了自己，他也很聪明，是一个很好的伙伴。此外，他还是一名医生，在如此危险的旅程中，这可能是至关重要的。</p><p> In mid-June, and having had a chance to observe all likely candidates during the winter months, Scott informed Wilson that he would be travelling south. Wilson was stunned. He had only joined the expedition to study the wildlife and geology. Indeed, he had no real inclination to go south, as he revealed in a letter to his wife, complaining that the journey would be “taking me away from my proper sphere of work to monotonous hard work on an icy barrier for three months.” There was also something of a question mark surrounding Wilson’s health. While he was now apparently well, he had initially been turned down for the  Discovery expedition, as he had suffered a bout of tuberculosis that left him with permanent lung damage, something that could prove debilitating on a long trek in freezing conditions.</p><p>6月中旬，斯科特有机会在冬季观察所有可能的候选人，他通知威尔逊他将向南旅行。威尔逊惊呆了。他加入探险队只是为了研究野生动物和地质学。事实上，正如他在给妻子的一封信中透露的那样，他并不真正想去南方。他抱怨说，这段旅程将“把我从我的工作领域带到冰冷的屏障上单调而艰苦地工作三个月”威尔逊的健康也有一些疑问。虽然他现在看起来很好，但他最初被拒绝参加探索探险队，因为他患了一场肺结核，导致永久性肺损伤，在寒冷的条件下长途跋涉可能会使他虚弱。</p><p>  In the circumstances, Wilson felt there was any number of people who could have been chosen ahead of him. However, in spite of all the reasons not to go, he could not turn the opportunity down. “My surprise can be guessed,” he wrote. “It is the long journey and I cannot help being glad I was chosen to go.”</p><p>在这种情况下，威尔逊觉得有很多人可以在他之前被选中。然而，尽管有种种理由不去，他还是不能拒绝这个机会。“我的惊讶是可以猜到的，”他写道。“这是一段漫长的旅程，我禁不住为自己被选中而感到高兴。”</p><p>  Wilson might have been bemused by the decision, but Shackleton was devastated. Although Shackleton was quick to pass on his genuine congratulations to his friend, he became downbeat and withdrawn. Suddenly, the one real chance to make a name for himself, to be etched forever into the history books, looked to be over. All that would remain was further months marooned on the ice, away from Emily, waiting for Scott and Wilson to return. It was a demoralizing prospect. But Shackleton wasn’t out of the running just yet.</p><p>威尔逊可能对这一决定感到困惑，但沙克尔顿却大吃一惊。虽然沙克尔顿很快向他的朋友转达了他真诚的祝贺，但他变得沮丧和孤僻。突然间，一个为自己成名、永远铭刻在历史书上的真正机会似乎结束了。剩下的只有几个月被困在冰上，远离艾米丽，等待斯科特和威尔逊回来。这是一个令人沮丧的前景。但沙克尔顿还没有退出竞选。</p><p>   Wilson was concerned that, with just the two of them out on the vast Barrier, if one should be incapacitated, it could prove fatal to the other. In private, Wilson therefore suggested to Scott that perhaps he might consider taking Shackleton as well. After some thought, Scott realized that Wilson’s reasoning made some sense. Shackleton had already proven his worth on the glacier, and he was a powerful man, capable of man-hauling for hundreds of miles. He was also resourceful and good company. It was therefore settled. Come October, the three of them would set off, aiming to make history, hoping to, at the very least, break the furthest south record of travel towards the pole.</p><p>威尔逊担心，只有他们两个人在巨大的障碍上，如果一个人丧失了能力，另一个人可能会因此丧命。私下里，Wilson建议史葛，也许他可以考虑把沙克尔顿也带走。经过一番思考，斯科特意识到威尔逊的推理是有道理的。沙克尔顿已经在冰川上证明了自己的价值，他是一个强大的人，能够将人拖上数百英里。他也是个足智多谋的好朋友。事情就这样解决了。到了10月，他们三人将出发，目的是创造历史，希望至少能打破最南端的北极旅行记录。</p><p> After a number of polar expeditions with one companion, and others with two, I look back and can see that things were always easier with just one other person. With only two of you, each time the leader makes a decision that the other person disagrees with, the latter will usually chew the matter over in their mind and will usually do as they are told. But with three, if two disagree with the leader’s decision, they might discuss it among themselves and an awkward mini-revolt may result. Even if this fails, it can lead to a bad atmosphere. If I lived all my expeditions over again, I would never take a third party if it could be avoided (unless one member of the group was my wife). As the old saying goes, “Two’s company, three’s a crowd.”</p><p>在与一位同伴和另外两位同伴进行了多次极地考察之后，我回头看，发现只有一个人的情况总是比较容易。由于你们只有两个人，每次领导做出另一个人不同意的决定时，另一个人通常会在脑海中仔细考虑这件事，并且通常会按照指示行事。但有三个人，如果两个人不同意领导人的决定，他们可能会相互讨论，并可能导致一场尴尬的小型叛乱。即使这样做失败，也可能导致恶劣的气氛。如果我重新体验我所有的探险活动，如果可以避免的话，我永远不会选择第三方（除非团队中有一名成员是我的妻子）。正如那句老话所说，“两个人作伴，三个人成群结队。”</p><p> For the beleaguered Shackleton, this was a tremendous stroke of good fortune. He was of course “overjoyed” when Scott asked him to become the third man for the great trek south, although, once again, not everyone shared his cheer. When the news broke there was a considerable amount of discontent from some of the crew. They could understand Scott taking Wilson, because he was a doctor, but they felt that the other place should surely have gone to a naval man.</p><p>对于陷入困境的沙克尔顿来说，这是一次巨大的好运。当斯科特要求他成为第三个参加南方大长途跋涉的人时，他当然“喜出望外”，不过，又一次，并不是每个人都分享他的欢呼。消息传出时，一些船员相当不满。他们可以理解斯科特带走威尔逊，因为他是一名医生，但他们觉得另一个地方肯定应该留给一名海军士兵。</p><p>   Armitage was particularly angry, writing bitter things about Scott for many years to come. Skelton also found it hard to bite his tongue, writing, “Shackleton gassing and eye-serving the whole time . . . of course the Skipper’s ideas are on the whole perfectly right . . . but . . . why he listens to Shackleton so much beats me—the man is just an ordinary gas-bag.” Yet no matter what anyone thought, Shackleton was Scott’s man and his decision was final.</p><p>阿米塔吉特别生气，在接下来的许多年里，他都在写关于斯科特的苦涩故事。斯凯尔顿也很难咬住自己的舌头，他写道：“沙克尔顿一直在用毒气和眼睛服务……当然船长的想法总体上是完全正确的……但是……为什么他这么多听沙克尔顿的话，让我觉得这个人只是一个普通的毒气袋。”然而不管大家怎么想，沙克尔顿是斯科特的人，他的决定是最终的。</p><p> With final preparations underway, and August bringing increasing hours of sunlight, Shackleton was tasked with attempting to train the dogs on the ice. This was a tall order; Shackleton had no experience, and the rowdy and undisciplined dogs were especially difficult to tame. Neither whipping them nor friendly persuasion worked particularly well, and Shackleton was too impatient to persevere for long with either.</p><p>随着最后的准备工作正在进行，8月份的日照时间越来越长，沙克尔顿的任务是尝试在冰上训练狗。这是一项艰巨的任务；沙克尔顿没有经验，那些吵闹和没有纪律的狗尤其难以驯服。无论是鞭打他们还是友好的劝说，效果都不是特别好，沙克尔顿太不耐烦了，无法长期坚持下去。</p><p> Some critics (including Scott in his own diary) suggested that he should have started his dog-team trials earlier than he did, even doing so under the winter moonlight. But such a course could easily have led to severe frostbite and dead dogs, as Amundsen’s Norwegian team was to experience some years later. Starting dog trials at the end of August, near his base, as Scott did, was undoubtedly the most sensible timing. Although he was not totally convinced by their performance, Scott eventually concluded that the dogs made things slightly less difficult than no dogs.</p><p>一些批评者（包括斯科特在自己的日记中）建议他应该比他更早开始他的狗团队试验，即使是在冬季月光下。但这样的过程很容易导致严重冻伤和狗死亡，阿蒙森的挪威团队几年后也会经历这种情况。和斯科特一样，8月底在他的基地附近开始试狗，无疑是最明智的时机。尽管斯科特对他们的表现并不完全信服，但他最终得出结论，这些狗比没有狗的事情稍微容易一些。</p><p>  In the meantime, Armitage was at least given a consolation prize for missing out on the journey south. On September 11, 1902 he set out with five men to find a route to the Magnetic Pole, where Earth’s magnetic field lines come vertically out of the surface. Finding this location would be crucial to the updating of magnetic maps of the southern hemisphere and thus to marine navigation. In contrast, the geographic South Pole, which Shackleton hoped to reach, is the place where all the lines of longitude converge in the southern hemisphere. For their journey, Armitage and his team all took skis, a decision about which a still-skeptical Scott commented, “I am inclined to reserve my opinion of the innovation.”</p><p>与此同时，阿米蒂奇至少因为错过了南部旅程而获得了一个安慰奖。1902年9月11日，他和五个人出发，寻找一条通往磁极的路线，在那里，地球的磁力线垂直地从表面出来。找到这个位置对于更新南半球的磁图，从而对海洋导航至关重要。相比之下，沙克尔顿希望到达的地理南极是南半球所有经线交汇的地方。阿米蒂奇和他的团队在旅途中都选择了滑雪，对此，仍然持怀疑态度的斯科特评论道：“我倾向于保留我对创新的看法。”</p><p>  However, as Armitage led his men to an inlet named New Harbour, two of them, Ferrar and Heald, became very ill. Closer investigation revealed that they were both suffering from an affliction that would threaten the success of the expedition: scurvy.</p><p>然而，当阿米蒂奇带领他的士兵来到一个名为“新港”的海湾时，其中两人，费拉尔和希尔德，病入膏肓。更仔细的调查显示，他们都患有坏血病，这将威胁探险队的成功。</p><p> Scurvy caused bruising, weakened muscles, could lead to tooth loss, severe joint pain and, in the worst cases, death. Today, we are well aware that scurvy is the result of a lack of vitamin C. However, this wasn’t the case at the turn of the last century. Certain patterns had been picked up over time, particularly that men near shore and eating fresh fruit, vegetables and meat seemed to be immune from the disease. It seemed most common when men were on long voyages, away from these things. Once they returned to the coastline and ate a heavy diet of fresh seal and penguin meat, they miraculously recovered, but no one yet realized that the crucial element was vitamin C.</p><p>坏血病导致瘀伤、肌肉无力，可能导致牙齿脱落、严重的关节疼痛，在最坏的情况下还会导致死亡。今天，我们清楚地意识到坏血病是缺乏维生素C的结果。然而，上世纪初的情况并非如此。随着时间的推移，人们发现了某些模式，尤其是那些靠近海岸、食用新鲜水果、蔬菜和肉类的人似乎对这种疾病免疫。当人们在远离这些东西的长途航行中时，这种情况似乎最为常见。一旦他们回到海岸线，吃了大量新鲜海豹和企鹅肉，他们奇迹般地恢复了健康，但还没有人意识到关键元素是维生素C。</p><p>    Adapted from   Shackleton: The Biography  by Ranulph Fiennes.
