If pressed to do so, many may choose to quit instead.\n In early July, after more than a decade working for a French bank, Marie could see no other option but to resign from her Paris-based role.\n The mother of two, whose surname is being withheld for professional reasons, enjoyed her job in the firm\u2019s wealth-management division. But in June, her bosses determined that, given the global pandemic continued to show signs of easing, everyone in the team would soon be ordered back to the office full time.\n Marie\u2019s husband had recently been offered a lucrative job in London. When he accepted, the prospect of the young parents holding down careers in two different countries looked unproblematic, because of the workplace changes that Covid-19 had triggered. Marie had been enthusiastic about the prospect of moving to London and catching the Eurostar train to Paris a few times a month for work, but as her employer started to insist on a return to in-person working, it became obvious that something would have to give.\n \u201cI\u2019d just spent well over 12 months proving that I was able to do my job entirely remotely, so being told that there was no longer any flexibility at all in terms of my physical location was extremely frustrating,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried for several weeks to come up with a solution, but in the end, I could see no other option than to quit. I loved working in finance, but my priority now is to find a new job that works for me and my family,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd that may well be in a different industry.\u201d\n As\u00a0 vaccination rates around the world\u00a0tick up, giving employers like Marie\u2019s the impetus to recall people to the office, businesses are confronting an uncomfortable reality: employees\u2019 needs and preferences have changed. Many are no longer prepared to return to the way of working that was conventional before the pandemic. If pressed to do exactly that,  millions are choosing to quit instead.\n  This trend has gathered so much momentum that academics are now speaking of a fundamental shift in power dynamics away from employers and toward workers. If businesses want to retain the loyal talent they need to stay competitive, experts argue they must listen to the needs of the labour market and adapt quickly.\n  Almuth McDowall, professor and assistant dean of the department of organisational psychology at London\u2019s Birkbeck University, explains that losses during the last 18 months have proven transformational.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve all experienced loss... losing loved ones, losing our freedom, losing human contact,\u201d she says. \u201cMany of us also had to juggle home-working with full-time caring, as children were off school.\u201d\n These life events felt so significant, says McDowall, that they caused us to revisit our priorities and sent many of us on a quest for work that feels purposeful \u2013 for a job that comes with some greater form of meaning.\n  Simultaneously, having seen what is possible under extreme circumstances, many workers feel more prepared now than ever before to challenge assumptions around what an ideal worker looks like, and what the parameters and norms of the working world should be.\n The effects of this momentous rethink are starting to show. In a\u00a0survey of more than 2,000 people\u00a0in the UK and Ireland conducted in March,\u00a0 more than a third of respondents said  they were looking to change roles in the next six to 12 months, or once the economy had strengthened. The researchers concluded businesses not actively catering to the evolving needs and demands of employees risked \u201csleepwalking towards a talent exodus\u201d.\n In the US, meanwhile, data indicate that such an exodus is already under way. A record\u00a0 4 million people quit their jobs\u00a0in April alone. Since then, the resignation rate has eased, but remains elevated.\n  Anthony Klotz, an associate professor of management at Texas A&amp;M University\u2019s Mays Business School, coined the term \u201c Great Resignation\u201d in May. Observing that there\u200b\u200b\u00a0were close to 6 million fewer resignations in the US during 2020 than there were in 2019, Klotz correctly predicted that, as the pandemic subsides, the \u201cwould-be quitters\u201d who \u201csheltered in place\u201d in 2020 were likely to act on their plans to leave their employers.\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a clear decrease in organisational commitment due to a confluence of factors,\u201d he says. Echoing McDowall, he says that employees have gained a new perspective on what\u2019s truly important to them \u2013 \u201cthe pandemic brought death to our doorstep and that causes people to reflect\u201d \u2014\u00a0but there are also other important reasons why loyalties have wavered.\n  \u201cWork takes up a huge part of who we are. During the pandemic, identities changed. People spent more time with their families, some might\u2019ve thought more about entrepreneurial ventures, side hustles or other pastimes away from their day job,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that many people no longer  define themselves as much through their jobs as they used to.\u201d That, Klotz elaborates, \u201cmeans that they are less emotionally attached to their employer\u201d.\n  Another element contributing to employees\u2019 dwindling commitment is the decision by some companies to require workers to return to the office in person, as in Marie\u2019s case. In particular, the  finance sector has come under fire for ordering workers back.\n In May, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which is America\u2019s largest bank, sparked a backlash when he said that working from home simply does not work for those\u00a0 who want \u201cto hustle\u201d. And in June, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said that if most employees were not back to work at the bank&#39;s Manhattan headquarters in September, he\u00a0 would be &#34;very disappointed&#34;.\n Globally, the culture of banking is still rooted in face time and\u00a0 presenteeism. Most financial organisations champion the value of in-person meetings to pitch for business and hash out deals, meaning that remote arrangements were always only going to be temporary. But in light of employees becoming more discerning, this might have to change too.\n  Regardless of the sectors, explains Klotz, companies that are ordering staff back into the office full time with no exceptions are going to have to find a way to \u201cpitch that in an appealing way\u201d. To stay competitive, businesses like banks and tech companies \u2013 some of which have adopted a remote culture indefinitely but  many of which have not \u2013 must understand that, while digital nomadism and remote work were not widely available before the pandemic, they will be from now on.\n Neither Klotz nor Almuth McDowall necessarily anticipate an industry-wide talent drain to materialise \u2013 mostly because there is such a broad spectrum of how individual organisations look to be structuring their post-pandemic workplaces in any given sector \u2013 but they both agree that businesses will lose good employees if they are not careful.\n \u201cWork arrangements is a brand new and important criteria that [employees] will care about going forward,\u201d says Klotz. \u201cPeople will want to choose the work arrangement that is best for whatever stage of life they\u2019re in, and companies will have to take that into account when determining how they operate.\u201d\n A recent PwC survey\u00a0found that  employees increasingly want to be compensated for their work not just with money, but with flexibility. \u201c[We\u2019ve also] found that younger workers are more likely than older employees to accept smaller pay increases for non-monetary benefits, including extensive  mental health benefits, unlimited sick time, flexible work hours and remote work options,\u201d says Bhushan Sethi, who jointly leads PwC&#39;s global people and organisation practice. In the wake of the pandemic, he adds, \u201cthese incentives can be the difference between a candidate accepting the job or not\u201d.\n  Stories like Marie\u2019s cast a grim light on the process of readjusting to a post-pandemic work world, but there is overarching evidence that Covid-19 has been a catalyst for good when it comes to the power that  employees in the labour market can yield.\n Indeed, Klotz argues that we are actually in the process of witnessing the dawn of the \u201cera of the empowered employee\u201d.\n In the US, the number of unemployed people has comfortably exceeded the number of available jobs for most of the last two decades, but currently the two measures are almost at level pegging, something that economists describe as an\u00a0 exceptionally tight labour market.\n \u201cHonestly, I can hardly recall a time when the job market was so much in the employee\u2019s favour and that\u2019s definitely a good thing,\u201d says Klotz. \u201cWages have to go up. Companies have to adapt. But it may well be a slow period of experimentation.\u201d\n \u201cAs an organisation, you don\u2019t just want to capture people\u2019s bodies, but you want to capture their hearts too. And it\u2019s that bit that\u2019s going to prove tough.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:49:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6,loyalty", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5458\u5de5\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6\u5904\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u70b9", "title_en": "Why worker loyalty is at a breaking point", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210721-why-worker-loyalty-is-at-a-breaking-point", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5fe0\u8bda\u5ea6", "loyalty"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1cd255583063072014e13f9b8f0ee5c9.jpeg", "infoid": 1069850, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u53d1\u8d77\u4e00\u573a\u53cd\u5bf9\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u6e38\u51fb\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5982\u6b64\u591a\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u6446\u8131\u6559\u80b2\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u4f17\u8bae\u9662\u62e8\u6b3e\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e0d\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a\u6700\u8fd1\u6295\u7968\u51b3\u5b9a\u4ece\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u524a\u51cf 4000 \u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8054\u90a6\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u91d1\u603b\u4f53\u589e\u52a0\u4e86 40%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 1028 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u524a\u51cf\u3002\u62dc\u767b\u603b\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u63d0\u8bae\u5c06\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u4fdd\u6301\u5728 4.4 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u5b57\u524a\u51cf\u4e86\u8fd1 10%\u3002\u66f4\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u662f\u8be5\u6cd5\u6848\u7b2c 314 \u6761\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u63aa\u8f9e\uff1a\u201c\u672c\u6cd5\u6848\u6216\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u6cd5\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u5747\u4e0d\u5f97\u6388\u4e88\u4e0e\u8425\u5229\u6027\u5b9e\u4f53\u7b7e\u8ba2\u5408\u540c\u4ee5\u8fd0\u8425\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u7ba1\u7406\u5b66\u6821\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u3002\u5b66\u6821\u3002\u201d\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4f9d\u8d56\u79c1\u4eba\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u98df\u54c1\u670d\u52a1\u6216\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u6709\u8d44\u683c\u83b7\u5f97\u4efb\u4f55\u8054\u90a6\u8d44\u91d1\u3002\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u7f57\u838e\u00b7\u5fb7\u52b3\u7f57 (Rosa DeLauro) \u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u5bf9 CNN \u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u9a73\u65a5\u4e3a\u201c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u5ba3\u4f20\u6d3b\u52a8\u201d\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6240\u5199\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u542b\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\uff0c\u8349\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6545\u610f\u7684\u3002\u5baa\u7ae0\u7684\u652f\u6301\u8005\u8bf4\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6559\u80b2\u90e8\u5b98\u50da\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u6177\u6168\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u662f\uff0c\u7279\u8bb8\u5b66\u6821\u662f\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u2014\u2014\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u8d44\u91d1\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5982\u679c\u56fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u79c1\u4eba\u627f\u5305\u5546\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u7acb\u5b66\u6821\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u7981\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5bf9\u7ae0\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u8003\u9a8c\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u8003\u9a8c\u2014\u2014\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5b66\u751f\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5229\u6da6\u3002 \u300a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u300b\u5c06\u5411\u60a8\u6536\u53d6 $ + \u7a0e\u6b3e\uff08\u5982\u679c\u9002\u7528\uff09\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u66f4\u6539\u60a8\u7684\u8ba1\u8d39\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8d39\u7387\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u53d1\u751f\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u63d0\u524d\u6536\u5230\u901a\u77e5\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u90e8\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Democrats in Washington say they want to reduce inequality. So why are they running a guerrilla campaign against charter schools that help so many children escape educational inequality?\n  That\u2019s the untold story at the House Appropriations Committee, where Democrats recently voted to cut $40 million from the federal Charter Schools Program. The cuts came despite an overall 40% increase in federal education funding to $102.8 billion. President Biden\u2019s budget proposed to hold spending for the Charter Schools Program flat at $440 million, but the committee cut that figure by nearly 10%.\n  Worse is the new language under the bill\u2019s Section 314: \u201cNone of the funds made available by this Act or any other Act may be awarded to a charter school that contracts with a for-profit entity to operate, oversee or manage the activities of the school.\u201d Charter schools say this could make schools that rely on private vendors for, say, food services or curricula ineligible for any federal funding at all.\n  Committee Chair Rosa DeLauro dismissed this criticism on CNN as \u201ca misinformation campaign.\u201d But the language as written is vague and sloppy, which may be intentional. Charter proponents are right to say they shouldn\u2019t have to rely on the Education Department bureaucracy for a generous interpretation of a mischievous provision.\n  The larger point is that charters are public schools and should be treated the same\u2014including in funding\u2014as traditional public schools. If Congress doesn\u2019t like private contractors, it should forbid them for traditional public schools as well.

"note_en": "The New York Power Authority is gearing up to launch a green hydrogen demonstration project at its gas-fired power plant on Long Island.\n The project, slated to begin construction in the fall, will involve replacing up to 30%\u00a0of the plant&#39;s gas-fired power with green hydrogen, which is created with renewable energy, in this case hydro power from Canada.\n New York&#39;s decision to begin testing the use of green hydrogen comes amid growing interest in the energy source globally, and could inspire other states to follow the Empire State&#39;s lead, said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition (GHC).\n    New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday announced the state would spend $8.5 million on the green hydrogen demonstration project at NYPA&#39;s Brentwood power plant on Long Island, which will help provide power at peak times for its combustion turbine. Installed in 2001, the turbine currently uses natural gas.\n The move comes as New York ramps up efforts to decarbonize its power sector, with a goal of reducing emissions  85%\u00a0below 1990 levels by 2050.\n General Electric will build a &#34;state-of-the art hydrogen/natural gas blending system,&#34; according to NYPA, while Fresh Meadow Power will install the system over the summer and provide &#34;piping system design&#34; and &#34;material procurement&#34; as well, according to NYPA. Airgas, a gas distribution company, will provide the green hydrogen, created with hydropower.\n Starting in October, NYPA, with help from the Electric Power Research Institute, will &#34;test different concentrations of hydrogen blended with natural gas at regular intervals,&#34; over a total of 10-15 hours over a six-to-eight week period, NYPA President and CEO Gil Quiniones said.\n The demonstration project will be the first by a state utility to study the &#34;feasibility of operating an existing power generation facility with a hydrogen and natural gas blend,&#34; according to NYPA.\n &#34;We are going to start at 5%\u00a0and methodically and systemically increase it up to 30,&#34; Quiniones said.\n As part of the demonstration project, the turbine at the Brentwood Power Station will be stopped periodically so the research team can look at various factors, including what happens to carbon emissions \u2014\u00a0and in particular, nitrous oxide \u2014\u00a0when you blend green hydrogen with natural gas, Quiniones said. The assessment team will also look at other key issues, such as safety, as well as whether there is any drop-off in the turbine&#39;s performance as green hydrogen is mixed in.\n GHC&#39;s Lin said New York&#39;s demonstration project, and the involvement of the state&#39;s governor, will help encourage other states to also start exploring green hydrogen.\n &#34;That leadership is so important to making change happen,&#34; Lin said. &#34;I am sure governors across the country are looking at this and saying &#39;wow,&#39; maybe we should look at green hydrogen.&#34;\n  But the focus of the New York project on retrofitting an existing plant is also important, with the potential, if successful, to roll out the technology at existing natural gas plants, as opposed to building specially designed generators, the NYPA chief said.\n &#34;There are a lot more existing power plants than brand new power plants,&#34; Quiniones said.\n Still, there is considerable debate over whether green hydrogen technology is advanced enough to make a significant contribution to reducing carbon emissions and battling climate change.\n GHC&#39;s Lin contends that green hydrogen is making big strides. There are plans for a green hydrogen power plant in Utah that will help supply power to Los Angeles, and there are a growing number of green hydrogen projects moving ahead in the United Kingdom, Europe and Saudi Arabia.\n  However, the Union of Concerned Scientists  has argued against devoting resources to green hydrogen research, contending the supply of green hydrogen is too constrained for the foreseeable future. The focus should be on replacing gas with electrification, the group has argued.\n Quiniones said he is aware of the criticism, but said that it would be a mistake to shut down research on a potentially valuable contributor to decarbonization.\n &#34;We are dealing with an existential threat, the climate crisis,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t think it is the time to start eliminating potential technologies that might be part of the solution.&#34;\n Meanwhile, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority is moving ahead with efforts to boost research into renewable energy storage projects, an initiative that was also announced by Cuomo on Thursday alongside the green hydrogen demonstration project.\n NYSERDA has set aside $12.5 million for demonstration projects and project development in the field of long-duration energy storage and is seeking proposals from researchers in &#34;hydrogen, electric, chemical, mechanical, or thermal-electric storage technologies that will address cost, performance, and renewable integration challenges in New York State,&#34; according to a spokesperson for the authority.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:47:40",

built home in June rose just 6% from June 2020\n The inventory of new homes for sale jumped from a 5.5-month supply in May to a 6.3-month supply in June. Last fall, it sat at a low of just 3.5 months.\n Sales of newly built homes dropped in June to the lowest level since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020,  according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Monday.\n Sales of new single family homes fell to an annualized rate of 676,000, 6.6% below May&#39;s rate of 724,000 and 19.4% below the June 2020 level of 839,000. Analysts were expecting new home sales to increase by 3.4% in June.\n  After a year of frenzied buying and price gains in the double digits, newly built homes are now out of reach for much of the demand that remains in the market.\n The median price of a newly built home in June rose just 6% from June 2020, and while that is a large gain historically, it is nothing compared with the 15%-20% annual gains seen in previous months.\n Most of the homebuying is on the higher end of the market, and builders cannot afford to put up affordable homes due to skyrocketing construction costs.\n Softwood lumber, in particular, spiked more than 300% during the pandemic, and while it has fallen back dramatically in the last month, it is still about 75% above its 2019 average. Other lumber products are still significantly more expensive.\n &#34;We also know there are shortages of appliances, labor and affordable lots,&#34; noted Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group. &#34;The moderation in home sales is likely a combination of sticker shock and the slowdown in the ability of builders to finish homes because of a variety of delays.&#34;\n  The inventory of new homes for sale jumped from a 5.5-month supply in May to a 6.3-month supply in June. Last fall, it sat at a low of just 3.5 months. In June, the number of homes for sale that had not yet been started hit an all-time high.\n &#34;Annual comparisons will get even more difficult in coming months, as it was this time last year that the market began to surge and reach highs not seen since before the Great Recession,&#34; wrote Zillow economist Matthew Speakman in a release.\n Buyers in June were also hit with higher mortgage rates, which spiked about a quarter of a percentage point during the month. While that may not sound like a lot, if buyers are already stretched by higher home prices, they have less of a financial cushion to absorb higher mortgage rates.\n Single family housing starts continue to gain, albeit slowly and not on the lowest end of the market. Permits, an indicator of future construction, are not as robust as the market needs.\n While there is unquestionably still strong demand from buyers, much of it is being squelched by affordability and supply issues. Those signs clearly showed up at builder home sites in June and have been a factor in weakening homebuilder sentiment for the past two months. Noted builder analyst Ivy Zelman wrote as much in a note last month.\n &#34;We are shifting our tone on the housing market based on our analysis of proprietary data showing early signs of a cool down,&#34; according to the note.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:47:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f4e\u70b9,boom,\u623f\u5c4b", "title":

Motors, which has resulted in the resignation of its CEO and CTO, has put the company at risk of failing. This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle. If approved by shareholders, hedge fund YA II PN will be able to purchase 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares.\n The capital provides a lifeline to Lordstown, which has struggled in recent months. The hedge fund, which is able to buy the shares at $7.48 a share, could also benefit financially if the stock price rises.\n  Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of former CEO Steve Burns\u2019 other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.\n The Ohio automaker was founded in 2019, and within a year  reached a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. The company had planned to begin production of its Endurance pickup truck starting in the second half of 2021 at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n Those plans faltered and a series of missteps and allegations of fraud compounded the company\u2019s problems.\n In March 2021, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has \u201cno revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.\u201d\n Hindenburg disputed that the company booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller said that \u201cextensive research reveals that the company\u2019s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.\u201d\n Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half \u2014 from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 \u2014 due to a lack of funding.\n Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by  attempting to calm investors a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022.

Not much is known about Gravity at this point, other than that it\u2019s scheduled to be available from 2023 and that it will use the same battery platform as the Air. Patent drawings submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, first noticed by a member of the  Lucid Forum, reveal little more than the renderings on Lucid\u2019s website.\n  The company is also planning on bringing more of the component production in-house, including major pieces such as the body panel stampings, the spokesman added. These parts were being handled by an external supplier.\n The Casa Grande City Council approved the plans to expand the nearly 1 million-square-foot space in March. The first phase of the factory, which cost around $700 million to construct, went up in a record 12 months after breaking ground. Lucid has said that it wants to expand production capacity from around 30,000 vehicles per year to up to 400,000.\n Lucid has had a long, sometimes tenuous road to the public market. The company first set its sights on bringing an electric sedan to production as early as 2018, but it quickly hit funding challenges that pushed this timeline further and further back. Lucid received major funding in 2018 with a $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which continued to be its largest shareholder throughout Lucid\u2019s \u00a0merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.\n That merger hit  a bit of a hiccup last week when the company failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on a key proposal \u2014 likely due to the rise of retail traders and malfunctioning spam filters, executives said in an investor call.\n Lucid, which will now operate under the name Lucid Group, is listed under the

Esponnette is the co-founder and executive chair of  unspun, a startup that makes custom-fit jeans from a body scan using machine learning and 3D weaving.\n  Sitting across from a venture partner, I wonder if they might feel more compelled by my words if I cut my hair short (really short), or grew a beard, or removed my pregnant belly. Would they take out their checkbook if I were more aggressive in what I promised? Would they be more interested in getting to know my business and me better if I passionately slammed the table?\n   Holmes  adopted a ridiculously low voice to get her startup off the ground in a world full of men. She promised impossible pinprick tests to detect hundreds of diseases and collected influential investors like Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Mattis and Betsy DeVos. She wore a Steve Jobs uniform \u2014 including the Issey Miyake turtleneck \u2014 and built a  team of 800 brilliant people. Did she go overboard with her lies? Yes. But she\u2019s not the only one. The Silicon Valley and venture landscape only exacerbated whatever beliefs she already had in her company and inclinations to promise the moon.\n Last week at a virtual hearing, she  pushed to keep a huge database of information protected from the government. Before that, she  claimed to have made $100 million in revenue in 2014, when it was really $100,000. These things, among others, are hands-down inexcusable. But I still believe that she thought she was doing the right thing taking the universal advice of Silicon Valley: \u201cFake it till you make it.\u201d\n She once  said,  borrowing from previous thought leaders: \u201cThis is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you\u2019re crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world.\u201d I wonder if she just thinks she\u2019s now on part two.\n Raising money to start a company is about two things: having connections and making an appearance. Connections are  difficult to make when you\u2019re a woman: \u201cOnly about 12% of decision-makers at VC firms are women, and most firms still don\u2019t have a single female partner.\u201d\n And even if you have connections, building relationships can be a bit weird: My cofounders end up being text buddies with our investors, while I hear news of things in passing. We hit a peak of 2.8% of funding going to women-led startups in 2019, but in 2020, that  dropped again to 2.3%, possibly because investors reverted to their standard habits of keeping their cards close during uncertain times. Furthermore, investors generally have expectations that are aligned with male tendencies. For example, identical slides and scripts that are read by men and women are judged very differently, with  men overwhelmingly rated higher. Holmes\u2019 deep voice, although off-putting,  probably made her more convincing.\n It\u2019s not easy to replicate the fundraising success that Holmes had, though. If other women tried to emulate this, they\u2019d likely be penalized: In general, forward men are viewed positively as assertive, while forward women are viewed as  emotionally unstable. This is confusing because, inversely, if women  retreat to stereotypically feminine behaviors, they are viewed as weak. Hillary Clinton got stuck in this during her presidential race \u2014 criticized for being aggressive and cold when stereotypically masculine traits and pegged as weak when showing stereotypically feminine traits.\n To make matters worse, it turns out that in pitches, women are  asked more preventative questions about potential loss and risk, while men are asked more promotional questions about upside and gains. Women can  work around this by answering any preventative question in the positive. Holmes knew this deep down and played into it. That was the only way for her to win.\n I am absolutely no  \u201cholmie,\u201d\u00a0but I do understand firsthand her need to role-play. I\u2019ve been overlooked; hell, I\u2019ve even been told to change my product line (bras) because venture capitalists won\u2019t get it. And they didn\u2019t. I gave in.\n I don\u2019t want to defend her, and I can\u2019t. It\u2019s so easy to drop a line at a party or a board meeting about how obnoxious she was in her venture, but what irks me is that we focus on her specifically as the problem, completely bypassing the environment that created her. I remember soaking up  John Carreyrou\u2019s tantalizing book thinking, \u201cWow, I\u2019ll never do that,\u201d as I started my company.

York-based advertising agency, convened the troops over Zoom this month to deliver a message he and his fellow partners were eager to share: It was time to think about coming back to the office.\n Mr. Gross, 40, wasn\u2019t sure how employees, many in their 20s and early 30s, would take it. The initial response \u2014 dead silence \u2014 wasn\u2019t encouraging. Then one young man signaled he had a question. \u201cIs the policy mandatory?\u201d he wanted to know.\n  Thus began a tricky conversation at Anchor Worldwide, Mr. Gross\u2019s firm, that is being replicated this summer at businesses big and small across the country. While workers of all ages have become accustomed to dialing in and skipping the wearying commute, younger ones have grown especially attached to the new way of doing business.\n And in many cases, the decision to return pits older managers who view working in the office as the natural order of things against younger employees who\u2019ve come to see operating remotely as completely normal in the 16 months since the pandemic hit. Some new hires have never gone into their employers\u2019 workplace at all.\n \u201cFrankly, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing, because we have a strong culture,\u201d Mr. Gross said. \u201cCreative development and production requires face-to-face collaboration. It\u2019s hard to have a brainstorm on a Zoom call.\u201d\n Some industries, like  banking and finance, are taking a harder line and insisting workers young and old return. The chief executives of Wall Street giants like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have signaled they expect employees to go back to their cubicles and offices in the months ahead.\n Other companies, most notably those in  technology and media, are being more flexible. As much as Mr. Gross wants people back at his ad agency, he is worried about retaining young talent at a time when churn is increasing, so he has been making clear there is room for accommodation.\n \u201cWe\u2019re in a really progressive industry, and some companies have gone fully remote,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou have to frame it in terms of flexibility.\u201d\n In a recent  survey by the Conference Board, 55 percent of millennials, defined as people born between 1981 and 1996, questioned the wisdom of returning to the office. Among members of Generation X, born between 1965 and 1980, 45 percent had doubts about going back, while only 36 percent of baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, felt that way.\n And if anything, the rise of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in recent days may fuel resistance among reluctant officegoers of all ages.\n  \u201cAmong the generations, millennials are the  most concerned about their health and psychological well-being,\u201d said Rebecca L. Ray, executive vice president for human capital at the Conference Board. \u201cCompanies would be well served to be as flexible as possible.\u201d\n Matthew Yeager, 33, quit his job as a web developer at an insurance company in May after it told him he needed to return to the office as vaccination rates in his city, Columbus, Ohio, were rising. He limited his job hunting to opportunities that offered fully remote work and, in June, started at a hiring and human resources company based in New York.\n \u201cIt was tough because I really liked my job and the people I worked with, but I didn\u2019t want to lose that flexibility of being able to work remotely,\u201d Mr. Yeager said. \u201cThe office has all these distractions that are removed when you\u2019re working from home.\u201d\n Mr. Yeager said he would also like the option to work remotely in any positions he considered in the future. \u201cMore companies should give the opportunity for people to work and be productive in the best way that they can,\u201d he said.\n  Even as the age split has managers looking for ways to persuade younger hires to venture back, there are other divides. Many parents and other caregivers are concerned about leaving home when school plans are still up in the air, a consideration that has disproportionately affected women during the pandemic.\n At the same time, more than a few older workers welcome the flexibility of working from home after years in a cubicle, even as some in their 20s yearn for the camaraderie of the office or the dynamism of an urban setting.\n Still, that so many young people are working from home is a reversal of longstanding habits, said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter, the online employment marketplace.\n \u201cThe norm for so long is that remote work in office jobs has been reserved for the oldest and most senior and most trusted,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how quickly young workers have embraced this.\u201d\n When they work apart, younger employees lose chances to network, develop mentors and gain valuable experience by watching colleagues close-up, veteran managers say.\n In some cases, older millennials like Jonathan Singer, 37, a real estate lawyer in Portland, Ore., find themselves making the case for returning to the office to skeptical younger colleagues who have grown accustomed to working from home.\n \u201cAs a manager, it\u2019s really hard to get cohesion and collegiality without being together on a regular basis, and it\u2019s difficult to mentor without being in the same place,\u201d Mr. Singer said. But persuading younger workers to see things his way has not been easy.\n \u201cWith the leverage that employees have, and the proof that they can work from home, it\u2019s hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d he said.\n Fearful of losing one more junior employee in what has become a tight job market, Mr. Singer has allowed a young colleague to work from home one day a week with an understanding that they would revisit the issue in the future.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just not possible to say no to some remote work,\u201d Mr. Singer explained. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not worth risking losing a good employee because of a  doctrinaire view that folks need to be in the office.\u201d\n Amanda Diaz, 28, feels relieved she doesn\u2019t have to go back to the office, at least for now. She works for the health insurance company Humana in San Juan, P.R., but has been getting the job done in her home in Trujillo Alto, which is about a 40-minute drive from the office.\n Humana offers its employees the option to work from the office or their home, and Ms. Diaz said she would continue to work remotely as long as she had the option.\n \u201cThink about all the time you spend getting ready and commuting to work,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead I\u2019m using those two or so hours to prepare a healthy lunch, exercising or rest.\u201d\n Alexander Fleiss, 38, chief executive of the investment management firm Rebellion Research, said some employees had resisted going back into the office. He hopes peer pressure and the fear of missing out on a promotion for lack of face-to-face interactions entices people back.\n \u201cThose people might lose their jobs because of natural selection,\u201d Mr. Fleiss said. He said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if workers began suing companies because they felt they had been laid off for refusing to go back to the office.\n Mr. Fleiss also tries to persuade his staff members who are working on projects to come back by focusing on the benefits of face-to-face collaborations, but many employees would still rather stick to Zoom calls.\n \u201cIf that\u2019s what they want, that\u2019s what they want,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t force anyone to do anything these days. You can only urge.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:58:27", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u529e\u516c\u5ba4,office", "title":

"note_en": "I last wrote about Deepmind\u2019s efforts to predict protein folding and structure  here, with their AlphaFold software. AlphaFold really performed very strongly in the 2020 protein folding challenge, and that got a lot of attention. Well, they\u2019ve  recently published a great deal of detail on how they did this, released their source code, and\u00a0 they\u2019ve announced that they\u2019re going to be releasing their computed structures of 350,000 proteins, to be followed in the coming months by up to 100 million more.  Here\u2019s the database. And a group at the University of Washington  has just published on their own similar approach (RosettaFold) and has also made this code freely available.\n So it\u2019s clear that the world of computational protein structure prediction is in a  very different place than it was a couple of years ago. But I\u2019m already on record as (1) cheering this sort of thing on while (2) saying that it  doesn\u2019t make as much difference to drug discovery as many stories and press releases have had it. Do the latest developments change my mind? What does this all mean? I\u2019ve been talking with colleagues and seeing comments from people in the field, so here\u2019s my attempt.\n Well, for one thing, it means that a lot of people in academia are going to have to rewrite their research grants. If you have been working on computational protein folding yourself, odds are that you have had your doors blown off by these recent developments and will need to rethink. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing left to do (far from it \u2013 read on) but anyone who was trying to do similar stuff to DeepMind was already in the position of the RosettaFold people, at best, and if you were trying to do similar work to RosettaFold, well. . .you\u2019d better target things carefully.\n Another thing that we\u2019re all going to have to get used to is that for years (decades) people have considered computational error to be the most likely source of error when a predicted structure and an experimental one don\u2019t match, and quite rightly so. We\u2019re getting to the point now where the ball is in the experimentalists\u2019 court, and that\u2019s something new. Right now, if you have a big mismatch between the two, it is frankly more likely to be an experimental error, because the folding predictions are getting so solid. This is disorienting, to say the least.\n There\u2019s also the synergy with the experimental data. For the many, many of us who are not cystallographers, X-ray data can seem like it\u2019s being delivered on golden tablets to the sound of trumpets. But protein X-ray structures  depend on model-building as well; you try to see which structures best fit the experimental electron density data. And those data can very often be interpreted in different ways, especially when it comes to subtle details of conformation. I say \u201csubtle\u201d, but sometimes those small structural things can make huge differences in protein function \u2013 just look at the  prolyl isomerase enzymes, whose job it is to make proline residues sit in the   cis or  trans fashion in the overall chain, and at the number of proteins whose downstream activities depend on such state-switching. Having access to such well-attested structural models changes the way that X-ray data are handled, and for the better. There are  also differences in protein structures depending on the method used to determine them, and these computations could help to resolve those, too.\n But what this leads to is what I keep pointing out when I give my various talks on the effects of AI and ML methods on chemistry and drug discovery. These things redefine grunt work: they make larger and larger areas that were formerly the site of human labor into machine labor instead, which is faster, more tireless, and getting more accurate all the time. What does that do to us humans? It pushes us towards higher-level problems that are not yet subject to computational or automated solutions. In the case of protein folding and structure, it means that we now will spend more of our time on the harder stuff: protein complexes, the classification and function of protein surfaces in general, the  effects of all the  wide variety of post-translational  modifications, the dynamics of protein conformation changes in real cell-biology time, the subtleties of how small-molecule ligands work their way in and out of binding sites, and the related question of how allosteric sites and cofactors modify these things from afar.\n It\u2019s important to realize that the new protein computational tools  do not make all these into solved problems. Not even close. They clear out a lot of obstacles so that we can get to these problems more easily and more productively, for sure, but they do not solve them once we get up to the actual rock faces in our particular gold mines. To pick an immediate example of this, I\u2019ve seen a comment from a structural biologist pointing out that when you ask AlphaFold for the structures of various key kinase enzymes, it gives you a very accurate one of what we already know to be the inactive form of the protein. Kinases have several regions that flop and scoot into different and easily accessible conformational states, and (at present, anyway) these structure prediction suites will not necessarily capture all of these, and they most certainly will not tell you which ones are associated with the active enzyme or would be more relevant to a protein\u2019s different functions  in vivo.\n Consider those prolines I just mentioned above: AlphaFold might give you a  cis proline in one protein structure or it might give you a\u00a0 trans one at some particular residue in a particular protein, but it will not be able to tell you that both of these are found in a living cell, that they are interconverted by yet another enzyme, and that the two forms will have totally different functions. Meanwhile,  other prolines in the same protein will never interconvert at all, and you won\u2019t know that, either. These details are up to us humans to work through. Similarly, many enzymes need cofactor molecules bound to them to do some of their work, and AlphaFold structures have no way to consider these \u2013 nor the presence of things like zinc or calcium ions that can also have a profound effect on protein structure and function. These are the tougher problems that will be ironed out by humans (literally, in the case of iron-associated proteins), with machine help.\n And that\u2019s why I talk the way I do about protein structure prediction and its effects on drug discovery. Drug discovery is all about those biological effects \u2013 what else could it be concerned with? And these are higher-order things than just the naked protein structure, as valuable as that can be. Remember, our failure rate in the clinic is around 90% overall, and  none of those failures were due to lack of a good protein structure. They were caused by much harder problems: what those proteins actually do in a living cell, how those functions differ in health and disease, how they differ between different sorts of human patients and between humans in general and the animal models that were used to develop the compounds, what other protein targets the drug candidate might have hit and the downstream effects (usually undesirable) that those kicked off, and on and on.\n So structural biology has been greatly advanced by these new tools. But it has not been outmoded, replaced, or rendered irrelevant. It\u2019s more relevant than ever, and now we can get down to even bigger questions with it.\n  Very measured and thoughtful take, sans the hype. AF2 certainly moves us forward, especially for proteins where no structure was previously available, but as is clear from many examples, it is not yet ready to handle things like disordered regions, multi protein complexes well.\n On the note of cofactors, I have a colleague who claims they ran the sequence of a just-solved structure on AF2 and it spat out a zinc coordinated by 4 Cys exactly as seen in the yet unreleased structure. So, maybe it does take that into account \u2013 atleast for well defined domains with cofactor bound structures in the PDB?\n  While I recognize the tone of your posts on this topic are meant to offset the popular hype, Derek, I find it a bit strange.\n Rather than nursing the wounds of traditional chemists/biologist and assuring them that their careers are secure, maybe we should spend more time thinking how a tech company is apparently able to jump into an orthogonal field and completely outstrip an entire academic community?\n What is the training that these people have that chemistry/biology students should be getting? What incentives are being offered that prevented the traditional stakeholders from making these advances themselves (as opposed to as a side project of a much wider tech company effort)? Which other conventional areas are likely next on the chopping block?\n  I actually came to the opposite conclusion. Google probably spent a huge amount of money and other resources on this project (as they do with many of their internal projects) and a single academic group with probably much fewer resources managed to create something almost as good. And it was clear that when the Baker group announced their results, the Google group rushed to release more of their results and code.\n  Sorry but you forgot to mention Baker has a group (army) of students that work as cheap labor around the clock. Not to mention that the money comes from grants\u2026tax dollars at work.\n  Well this is all true but even a well funded academic lab has a tiny budget and resource base compared to google/deepmind.\n  You\u2019re kind of implying that Google didn\u2019t dip directly into the academic pool of life science talent, which is simply not true.\n  Most of these people are moving back-and-forth. Graduate students have already figured out the value of AI training, and are using it to further their own life science goals. I doubt too many biotech companies or academic institutions would hold a Google AI residency against you.\n  As a \u201ctraditional chemist\u201d, it\u2019s not obvious to me why this specific development would be a threat to my career. Google is better at pattern-matching from huge swaths of data than I am, just like Agilent is better than I am at manufacturing LC-MS instruments.\n When we get to the point that computational methods are able to *accurately* suggest compounds that need to be made to bind tightly to a specific site on a protein, then I\u2019ll be worried about my job. But this isn\u2019t that, and it\u2019s not clear to me that we are going to be getting much closer to that any time soon (fortunately for me, but unfortunately for everyone that has an unmet medical need).\n  I think this is realistic assessment of recent developments in computational protein folding using AI/ML. One consequence is that success in protein folding will increase blond faith that AI/ML can also deliver solutions to the tougher problems that drug designers face (e.g. prediction of unbound intracellular drug concentration in vivo when it can\u2019t even be measured in real time) and this could lead to an erosion of the critical thinking skills of drug discovery scientists. As prediction of protein structure gets better, experimental protein structure scientists will need to look for ways in which to add value to experimental protein structure. Mapping interaction potential (e.g. with fragments) would be one obvious way forward and it may also prove possible to use ligands to drive a protein into different regions of the conformational space relevant to the protein\u2019s function.\n  \u201cprediction of unbound intracellular drug concentration in vivo when it can\u2019t even be measured in real time\u201d If something can\u2019t be measured today, then it\u2019s probably not being used by medicinal chemists today. So either drug discovery doesn\u2019t need it, or medicinal chemists are just guessing anyway. Either way, it might be a \u201ctougher problems that drug designers face\u201d but it\u2019s not relevant to the practice of drug design today.\n  Headline over at Endpoints News: \u201cGoogle\u2019s DeepMind opens its protein database to science \u2014 potentially cracking drug R&amp;D wide open\u201d\n So that tough nut of drug discovery will finally yield in dramatic fashion. Just like it\u2019s done before (e.g., genome project).\n Seriously though \u2014 nice write up about the promise &amp; the challenges that remain, Derek.\n  How much work has been done on predicting the structure of proteins containing unnatural amino acids (which should soon be common in biotech)? (Anyone working on adding a-aminoisobutyric acid to the genetic code? It should be possible to significantly increase protein stability with major industrial applications.)\n  I agree wholeheartedly that the notion that Deepmind and AI haven\u2019t really finished anything, it just shifts our focus further down the road. But, I think you\u2019re skipping one of the key opportunities that Rosetta has offered: running the machine in reverse.\n (In full disclosure, I spent years working with his lab on the incredibly difficult problem of designing de novo proteins as high affinity binders to small molecules. In my opinion he and the students attracted to his group represent our \u2018best and brightest,\u2019 which makes it even more remarkable that they are such generous collaborators.)\n The rubber hits the road when you try to jump the gap between a computationally designed high affinity binding complex and a protein that can actually be expressed. It\u2019s trivial to generate thousands and thousands of high quality designs. The problem is that so many of them just turn into scrambled eggs when you try to make them. Making them all and screening becomes prohibitive, particularly as the proteins get larger. Some of the more promising approaches in this area revolve around improving the design scoring algorithms by querying against known structures. Nearest I can tell, these advances will massively expand our pool of available examples. I don\u2019t know if it will move the statistics from \u201cunlikely\u201d to \u201cprobable\u201d, but it certainly won\u2019t hurt.\n  I remember Eric Drexler arguing decades ago that designing proteins for a desired stable shape should be a lot easier than solving protein folding. (There\u2019s a link to Drexler, PNAS \u201981 on my name.) Does your experience have anything pro or con to say about this? It sounds like he may have been correct about the designs (easy to make thousands of high quality ones) but that cells find those designs hard to produce (scrambled eggs)?\n  Eric Drexler predicted enough garbage that some of it was bound to be close to right. Given the body of work, I\u2019d ignore it.\n  My experience was humbling. You need a stable apo design, or the protein fails to fold and collapses or just fails to fully express. That would be hard enough, but it\u2019s no use if you don\u2019t have some way for the protein to dock and generate a stable complex with the target. That\u2019s generally where the designing starts, then you downselect against your predicted stability scores, whatever the hell those might be. Algorithms to identify this are right out on the cutting edge, I saw a bunch light up and flame out. In many cases, designing/expressing/scoring training sets can give information, but that\u2019s pretty painstaking.\n As far as Drexler\u2019s hypothesis? As the kids say, \u201cMyth Busted.\u201d\n  Derek, this is an informative review of computer-aided protein structure predictions and its promises and realist perspectives. Here is however the critical question: Which pharma company is willing to use structure prediction technology as a the key basis for a drug discovery campaign? I guess at present none. I personally would also not do so. There are just too many variables, such a post-translational modifications, conformational changes, effects of membrane lipid composition, etc. that make these predictions nice and impressive computational exercises. The practical value is however very limited. The example given for X-ray crystallography, where a computer-generated structure can assist in the the structure determination process is surely good one. All is reminiscent to me of the computational rational drug discovery hype twenty years ago. It easy to generate drugs on a computer but difficult to get them approved by the FDA\u2026.\n  one small company already has benefitted from de novo protein design, compliments of an early protein folding/medicinal chemist genius \u2013 Bill DeGrado (U Penn, now UCSF) \u2014 in the form of a late-stage HDP-mimetic, brilacidin DeGrado and peers were way ahead of the times in early 2000s when it comes to de novo protein design with real-world applications see links below  https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-promise-of-designer-protein-in-the-fight-against-covid-19  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeIVx_zGezc  http://www.ipharminc.com/s/new_weapons_for_the_germ_wars.pdf\n  The original success of AlphaFold led me to initiate a conversation with the group at DeepMind in mid 2019 \u2013 after 2 meetings, we understood the potential collaboration was not going to work. We also have a collaboration with Institute of Protein Design. After their paper came out in Nature, I once again contacted the AlhpaFold team (via a Google intermediary this time), and while they have released the code in GitHub, the key is only for academics. So not ready for drug discovery companies yet. I am told something may happen.\n I think DeepMind felt the heat from the RosettaFold publication. One key idea from this publication is that it predicted the IL-12R/IL-12 protein-protein interaction correctly, fitting to the Cry-EM structure. There were key additional insights that came out of the model, that can be useful for drug design. Protein-Protein interactions are going to be a good way for these algorithms to help move the ball forward. And I understand Nvidia is going to a version of AlphaFold native to their SuperPod architecture. Coupled with additional AI based speedups of ab initio computations, as a molecular dynamics and protein folding person, I personally am optimistic that the field might be close to an inflection point.\n  AlphaFold2 is certainly impressive on many levels. One of their predictions of a large, globular protein fits like a glove in our newly acquired cryo-EM map. Our 4.5A map is now an atomic model, huzzah !!! But\u2026 whenever proteins have multiple domains, AlphaFold2 is far less accurate \u2013 I have 2 EM maps which clearly say that AlphaFold is right at the single domain level, and completely wrong at predicting how the whole multidomain protein is assembled. This is expected, multi domain assembly is similar to protein complex prediction, which AlphaFold2 is not built for. (And, who is to say that the domains are assembled, assemble in only one configuration, etc..) Nevertheless, keep in mind that AlphaFold can fail in unexpected and unforeseen ways\u2026 so as always caveat emptor. What worries me is that due to the reputation of AlphaFold people will start taking these models as oracles\u2026\n   Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.",

collaborate on the creation of an independent, non-profit, open source foundation to safeguard the interests of the entire Scala community.\n  How much interest would there be in a community sponsored fork of the  #Scala toolchain? RTs and fav&#39;s please.\n\u2014 Miles Sabin (@milessabin)  August 25, 2014\n It generated a lively response, both on Twitter and privately. The responses were sometimes perplexed, but typically excited and invariably positive. What I want to do here is provide some background to the question and sketch out the directions that positive answers lead.\n As the Scala community has matured, a number of different strands of development of the language have emerged,\n The LAMP/EPFL Dotty compiler is focused on providing a practical implementation of the DOT calculus.\n      The Scala.Meta system aims to provide portable metaprogramming facilities across a variety of Scala compilers.\n  There are several research and private variants of the Scala compiler in development and use by a variety of academic and commercial organizations.\n  The IDEs provide their own Scala variants which more or less accurately approximate Typesafe Scala.\n Of these, the only compiler targeting the JVM which is generally suitable for use by the Scala community at large in the near term is the Typesafe Scala compiler. The current roadmap for the 2.12 release of this compiler, due in early 2016, has very modest goals, consistent with Typesafe\u2019s focus. Beyond that, the Next Steps roadmap mentions many things of interest, however it is clear that these are all a long way out \u2013 it will be 2017 at the earliest before any of this sees the light of day.\n Typesafe\u2019s motivation for focusing on stability and Java 8 compatibility is very easy to understand. Typesafe is a commercial entity with products to sell in the JVM-based enterprise middleware space. Its primary software offerings, Akka and Play, are probably the most Java-friendly Scala projects of any significance, and simple arithmetic should tell you that a very large proportion (probably a large majority) of the potential customers for these (and the associated consultancy, training and support) are mainly Java enterprises with wholly or largely Java codebases and development teams. In this context it should be easy to see that for them an emphasis on Scala as a complement to Java, rather as its successor, is paramount.\n Whilst this is entirely reasonable, and meets the needs of many, there is nevertheless a significant constituency at the core of the Scala community whose needs are not being fully met. This constituency is the segment of the Scala community which puts greater emphasis on typeful functional programming styles and which has a strong interest in current developments in functional programming in the wider world beyond Scala. The projects gathered here under the Typelevel umbrella are prime examples of that constituency.\n As the producers and consumers of these and other projects we continually find ourselves running up against limitations of current Scala. Sometimes these limitations are minor and amenable to simple workarounds, many of which have passed into Scala folklore. Other limitations are more serious and can only be worked around with cumbersome encodings or otherwise elaborate and confusing hacks. These have the unfortunate consequence that elegant solutions to important problems are obscured by layers of cruft which exist only to sidestep quirks of the current compiler.\n What makes this all the more frustrating is that many of these limitations are comparatively easy to remove. Fixes for some of them are purely syntactic \u2013 for instance type constructor partial application, of huge importance to Scalaz and its users, has a clunky encoding (\u201ctype lambdas\u201d) which could be given first class syntactic support without any impact on Scala\u2019s semantics and in a completely binary compatible way. Similarly, syntactic support for singleton types for literal values (see SIP-23) would be of enormous value to shapeless and Spire and their users. And the addition of literals for Bytes and Shorts would be welcomed by Spire, Scodec and many others. Other fixes, whilst affecting semantics, would do so only in a conservative way \u2013 programs which are valid when compiled with the Typesafe Scala compiler would have the same meaning and binary representation when compiled with the fixes in place.\n With this in mind, we intend to create a new Scala distribution, as a conservative fork of the Typesafe Scala compiler, with a focus on meeting the needs of the part of the Scala community which has coalesced around the Typelevel stack. As a conservative fork, our aim is to be merge compatible from the Typesafe Scala compiler, and a key objective is to feed pull requests (many of which will resolve long standing Scala bugs or feature requests) back to the Typesafe Scala compiler. Our goal is to have a language which continues to evolve at the pace we saw until a couple of years ago, but with the difference that this will now be an opt-in process and the priorities will be set by the community.\n Of course the devil is in the details. Forking a compiler is only a small part of the story \u2013 in many ways more important is the surrounding ecosystem of libraries. As part of this initiative we intend to publish compatible builds of at least the Typelevel libraries \u2013 taking our lead from the Typesafe community build (which attempts to track ecosystem coherence over time by building a selection of community libraries against the development Scala compiler as it evolves) and Scala.js (which has ported a selection of important community libraries to its compiler).\n We welcome the participation of all other parties, individuals or organizations, who share our general goals \u2013 both those who want to contribute to the development of the compiler and those who would like their libraries and frameworks to be part of a Typelevel community build. It\u2019s early days, but we hope that with enough enthusiastic participation we will be able to produce useful binaries well before the end of the year.\n  As I observed earlier, there are already several variants of the language in existence and it has been clear for a long time that different sections of the community have different interests. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of acknowledging this fact \u2013 attempting to ignore it will be (arguably is already) counterproductive. Instead we should embrace diversity as a sign of a healthy and vigorous platform and community.\n  That we don\u2019t have the resources or the expertise to pull this off.\n  We disagree \u2013 the community around the Typelevel projects contains many of the most able Scala programmers on the planet. Between us we have a deep understanding of Scala\u2019s type system and other semantics (both as specified and as implemented), of compiler construction in general and of Typesafe Scala compiler internals in particular. We are intimately familiar with the Scala toolchain, which many of us have been using at scale for years in our day jobs. We are also intimately familiar with the issues that we seek to address \u2013 they are ones we face daily.\n  We also have the existence proof of the other Scala compiler variants. The number of full-time-equivalent people working on these projects is really very small \u2013 we believe that in practice this can be matched or exceeded by an open, inclusive and enthusiastic open source project.\n  No, we really don\u2019t. We fully expect this to be the most challenging part of the whole exercise. That said, we have the benefit of years of experience of Scala binary compatibility issues, and we know now that a combination of a community-build style model along with effective use of the Migration Manager (already a component of the Typelevel SBT plugin) is enormously helpful in keeping on top of the issue.\n  There is a real risk here, and care will be needed. One thing is for sure though \u2013 if we don\u2019t try, we\u2019ll never know if it\u2019s possible.\n  It\u2019s certainly true that restricting ourselves to only changes which are merge compatible with the Typesafe Scala compiler puts fairly strict limits on what we can do. Many highly desirable changes fall well beyond, and some people want to explore those possibilities.\n  We think that this is completely reasonable, and we don\u2019t think the two are mutually exclusive \u2013 a merge compatible Typelevel compiler meets many of our immediate needs, but we want to enable people to push further just as is being done by Scala.Meta, Scala Virtualized and Dotty.\n  We believe that the same infrastructure (community builds, MiMa) that will help the merge-compatible Typelevel compiler stay close to the Typesafe compiler will also be of great assistance to people who want to experiment with more radical changes. At a minimum, community build infrastructure will enable people to work with not just a bare compiler with but a core set of compatible libraries as well. We believe that such infrastructure would also benefit Scala Virtualized, Scala.Meta and Dotty.\n This brings me to the final part of this message. It has become clear to us that there are many distinct stakeholders in the Scala ecosystem with a mixture of shared and divergent interests. This is a good thing and is something we should jointly strive to support. To that end, we believe that it is time for the formation of an independent, non-profit, open source foundation to safeguard the interests of the entire Scala community \u2013 we call on all organizations and individuals who want to see a flourishing Scala ecosystem to join with us in that project.\n  Unless otherwise noted, all content is licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution

charging ahead with a sequel to the device, and now we have the first credible pictures of it. The story here is kind of weird. We&#39;re not actually sure where the pictures are from (they&#39;ve been uploaded to  this random YouTube channel\u00a0with other uncredited content), but  Windows Central&#39;s Zac Bowden says the images are legit, and since he has had an impeccable history of nailing Surface Duo rumors, his affirmation is good enough for us.\u00a0Bowden calls the two devices shown off in the leak &#34;near-final prototypes.&#34;\n The most obvious change in the pictures is a huge camera bump on the back of the device. The bump houses three cameras, along with what looks like an LED flash to the right and one more sensor, perhaps laser autofocus, just below the flash. The standalone fingerprint reader on the side is gone (Windows Central speculates it will be integrated into the power button), and the USB-C port on the bottom is now centered. Sadly, we don&#39;t know what the inside looks like yet.\n The Surface Duo 1 never had a good camera solution\u2014in fact, it didn&#39;t have a rear camera at all. Cameras are one of the biggest thickness demands on a phone body (hence the camera bumps), and the Surface Duo, being one of the thinnest phones ever made (at only 4.8 mm thick for each half), simply didn&#39;t have room for a good camera. The device only got one low-quality front camera, and since the phone was foldable, it could pull double-duty as a rear camera, too.\n  Skipping out on a rear camera for the Duo 1 wasn&#39;t the only solution Microsoft tried, though\u2014early prototypes showed a rear camera with a corresponding divot on the other half of the device, allowing the proto-Duo to have a rear camera bump and still fold flat. This Duo 2 prototype has a big camera bump but no divot on the other side, so it looks like it won&#39;t fold flat? A big selling point of the first Duo was the 360 hinge and the ability to use it in single-screen mode if you wanted, but it seems like that feature is being compromised. Another problem with the Duo 1 was its weird and out-of-date spec sheet, but many of the device&#39;s technical shortcomings will be fixed in the sequel.\u00a0Windows Central says the phone will ship with a modern SoC\u2014the  Snapdragon 888\u2014along with NFC, one of the more bizarre omissions of the Duo 1. The phone should ship sometime in September or October.\n     The Surface Duo 1 was Microsoft&#39;s first-ever self-branded Android phone and the company&#39;s first swing at a smartphone since the Nokia Windows Phone days. By all accounts, the Duo 1 was a disaster. In  our time with it, we experienced a ton of bugs and glaring software deficiencies, like its poor keyboard. But our big takeaway was that\u00a0the form factor didn&#39;t work. Even when folded up, the Duo 1 was significantly wider than any other device on the market, eclipsing even historically huge phones like the Nexus 6 by 10 mm, which made it uncomfortable to hold or shove into a pocket. Android doesn&#39;t scale well to ultra-wide screens (tall is fine, wide is not), so the phone didn&#39;t show much content.\n The two-screen design also wasn&#39;t that compelling. A tablet or foldable can offer similar side-by-side app action and also provide the flexibility of a single big screen for videos and tablet apps, which isn&#39;t viable on the split-screen Duo. The Duo also didn&#39;t have a front screen for notifications, which is a standard feature on every other foldable device like the Galaxy Fold and Flip, the Moto Razr, and the Xiaomi and Huawei foldables. When your phone beeps, you want to be able to glance at it to see the notification without having to use two hands to open and close the device. It does not seem like any of these issues will be addressed in the sequel.\n The Surface Duo was a failure in the market, too, with discounts starting nearly immediately. Today, the sky-high $1,400 MSRP is down to almost $1,000 off. The hottest fire sale saw Duos being unloaded for\u00a0 $409, but today, these things are just sitting around  in Amazon warehouses for $419, and they still aren&#39;t selling out. You would think that a serious market flop like the Duo 1 would lead to dramatic changes in the sequel, but Microsoft does not seem deterred.\n The company can at least fix some of the buggy software and out-of-date hardware it shipped with the Duo 1. But if you weren&#39;t a fan of the concept before, the Duo 2 isn&#39;t trying to do much to change your mind.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:18:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,duo", "title": "\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684 Microsoft Surface Duo 2 \u6cc4\u6f0f", "title_en": "Here\u2019s the first credible Microsoft Surface Duo 2 leak", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/heres-the-first-credible-microsoft-surface-duo-2-leak/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "duo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4efa3fc8f778a16309b09d9bacd88500.jpg", "infoid": 1069831, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u5934\u76d4\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e3d\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6cbb\u7597\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u7a81\u7834\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u5934\u76d4\u4ea7\u751f\u78c1\u573a\u5c06\u81f4\u547d\u80bf\u7624\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7597\u7684 53 \u5c81\u60a3\u8005\u6700\u7ec8\u56e0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u53bb\u4e16\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5c38\u68c0\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u624b\u672f\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5207\u9664\u4e86 31% \u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5757\u3002\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e3a\u80f6\u8d28\u6bcd\u7ec6\u80de\u7624\u7684\u81f4\u547d\u8111\u764c\u7684\u65e0\u521b\u7597\u6cd5\u3002\u5934\u76d4\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u4e09\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c\u78c1\u94c1\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u53ef\u5145\u7535\u7535\u6c60\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u8bca\u6240\u4f69\u6234\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u4e94\u5468\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u59bb\u5b50\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u56de\u5bb6\u3002\u5934\u76d4\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u7597\u6cd5\u6700\u521d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u6bcf\u5929\u6700\u591a\u516d\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u5242\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u8005\u2014\u2014\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86 FDA \u7684\u540c\u60c5\u4f7f\u7528\u6cbb\u7597\u2014\u2014\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u6709\u671d\u4e00\u65e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6cbb\u7597\u8111\u764c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u653e\u7597\u6216\u5316\u7597\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u2026\u2026\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u521b\u548c\u65e0\u6bd2\u6cbb\u7597\u7684\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u2026\u2026\u672a\u6765\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u201d\u901a\u8baf\u4f5c\u8005\u517c\u80af\u5c3c\u65af\u00b7R\u00b7\u76ae\u514b\u8111\u548c\u5782\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4efb\u5927\u536b\u00b7\u5df4\u65af\u91d1\u8bf4\u3002\u4f11\u65af\u987f\u536b\u7406\u516c\u4f1a\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u795e\u7ecf\u5916\u79d1\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u524d\u6cbf\u6742\u5fd7\u4e0a\u3002", "note_en": "We\u2019ve seen  helmets and  AI that can spot brain tumors, but a new hard hat can actually treat them, too. As part of the latest neurological  breakthrough, researchers used a helmet that generates a magnetic field to shrink a deadly tumor by a third. The 53-year-old patient who underwent the treatment ultimately passed away due to an unrelated injury. But, an autopsy of his brain showed that the procedure had removed 31 percent of the tumor mass in a short time. The test marked the first noninvasive therapy for a deadly form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma.\n The helmet features three rotating magnets connected to a microprocessor-based electronic controller operated by a rechargeable battery. As part of the therapy, the patient wore the device for five weeks at a clinic and then at home with the help of his wife. The resulting magnetic field therapy created by the helmet was administered for two hours initially and then ramped up to a maximum of six hours per day.

He has pleaded not guilty to five federal charges, including bringing a firearm to the Capitol grounds and a charge of obstructing justice. His Windows laptop was one of several devices seized by the FBI, which investigators said was protected with a password, but that it could also be unlocked using Reffitt\u2019s face.\n Prosecutors said forensic evidence suggested that the laptop contained gigabytes of footage from Reffitt\u2019s helmet-worn camera that he allegedly used to record some of the riot, and asked the court if it could compel Reffitt to sit in front of the computer to unlock it.\n Reffitt\u2019s lawyer told the court that his client could \u201cnot remember\u201d the password, but the court sided with the government and  granted the motion to compel his biometrics. Reffitt\u2019s lawyer told CNN, which  first reported the court order, that the laptop is now unlocked.\n The government took advantage of a loophole in the Fifth Amendment, a constitutional right that grants anyone in the U.S. the right to remain silent, which includes the right to not turn over information that could implicate themselves in a crime,  such as a password. But some courts have ruled that those protections don\u2019t extend to a person\u2019s physical attributes that can be used in place of a password, such as a face scan or fingerprint.\n In Reffitt\u2019s indictment, the FBI said as such, arguing that compelling Reffitt to unlock his computer by sitting in front of it \u201cwould not run afoul of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\u201d\n Courts across the U.S. are still divided on the reading of the Fifth Amendment and whether or not it applies to the compelled use of a person\u2019s biometrics. The U.S. Supreme Court isn\u2019t likely to address the issue any time soon, rejecting two petitions in as many years to rule on the matter, leaving it largely up to the states to decide.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 01:17:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u7535\u8111,\u547d\u4ee4,orders,reffitt", "title": "\u6cd5\u9662\u547d\u4ee4\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u4f1a\u66b4\u5f92\u201c\u7528\u8138\u201d\u89e3\u9501\u4ed6\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCourt orders US Capitol rioter to unlock his laptop \u2018with his face\u2019\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/court-orders-us-capitol-rioter-to-unlock-his-laptop-with-his-face/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u7535\u8111", "\u547d\u4ee4", "orders", "reffitt"]}]
