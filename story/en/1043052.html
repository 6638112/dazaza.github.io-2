You were such a champion for Ray’s legacy — his advocate for both the National Medal of Arts and Pulitzer Prize. As we look at his 100th birthday, I want to ask: Why is Bradbury important in literary terms?</p><p>  萨姆·韦勒：我第一次见到你是在2004年11月为雷·布拉德伯里（Ray Bradbury）举行的白宫典礼上。你真是雷（Ray）遗产的拥护者-他的国家艺术奖章和普利策奖的拥护者。当我们看着他的100岁生日时，我想问：为什么布拉德伯里在文学上很重要？</p><p> DANA GIOIA: Ray Bradbury is one of the most important American writers of the mid-20th century. He transformed science fiction’s position in American literature during the 1950s. There were other fine sci-fi writers, but Ray was the one who first engaged the mainstream audience. He had a huge impact on both American literature and popular culture. He was also one of the most significant California writers of the last century. When one talks about Bradbury, one needs to choose a perspective. His career looks different from each angle.</p><p> DANA GIOIA：雷·布拉德伯里（Ray Bradbury）是20世纪中叶最重要的美国作家之一。在1950年代，他改变了科幻小说在美国文学中的地位。还有其他优秀的科幻作家，但雷是第一个吸引主流读者的人。他对美国文学和大众文化都产生了巨大影响。他还是上世纪加州最重要的作家之一。当谈到布拉德伯里时，需要选择一种观点。他的职业生涯从各个角度看起来都不同。</p><p> It’s interesting. You see him as a California writer. He moved to California from Illinois in April 1934. He was 13 years old and he’s often associated with the Midwest, the prairie, and its ideals. How do you separate those two things? Is he a Californian or Midwestern writer? Is he both? Or does the question ultimately not matter?</p><p> 这真有趣。您将他视为加利福尼亚作家。他于1934年4月从伊利诺伊州移居加利福尼亚。他13岁，经常与中西部，大草原及其理想息息相关。您如何分开这两件事？他是加利福尼亚作家还是中西部作家？他俩都是吗？还是这个问题最终没有关系？</p><p> Regional identity matters more in American literature than many critics assume. We have a very mobile society, so today many writers are almost placeless. But Bradbury is a perfect example of a writer for whom regional identity was very important.</p><p> 在美国文学中，地区认同的重要性比许多评论家所认为的要重要。我们的社会非常活跃，所以今天许多作家几乎没有地方。但是，布拉德伯里（Bradbury）是一个作家的完美典范，对于他而言，区域认同非常重要。</p><p> How do you decide where a writer comes from? There are two possible theories — both valid. The first theory looks at where a writer was born and spent his or her childhood. But I favor a different view. I believe a writer belongs to the place where he or she hits puberty. That’s the point where the child goes from a received family identity to an independent adult existence.</p><p> 您如何确定作家的来源？有两种可能的理论-都有效。第一个理论研究作家出生并度过童年的地方。但我赞成另一种观点。我相信作家属于他或她进入青春期的地方。这就是孩子从获得的家庭身份转变为独立的成年人的关键所在。</p><p> Once Bradbury came to Southern California, he never left. He lived in Los Angeles for 77 years. All of his books, all of his stories, novels, and screenplays were written here. The great imaginative enterprise of his life — bringing science fiction into the American mainstream — happened in California.</p><p> 布拉德伯里来到南加州后，就再也没有离开过。他在洛杉矶生活了77年。他的所有书籍，他的所有故事，小说和剧本都写在这里。他一生中最富想象力的事业-将科幻小说带入了美国主流-在加利福尼亚发生了。 </p><p>  Let me offer one perspective. If you compiled a list in 1950 of the biggest grossing movies ever made, it would have contained no science fiction films and only one fantasy film,  The Wizard of Oz. In Hollywood, science fiction films were low-budget stuff for kids. The mainstream market was, broadly speaking, “realistic” — romances, comedies, historical epics, dramas, war films, and adventure stories.</p><p>让我提供一个观点。如果您编纂一份1950年有史以来票房最高的电影的清单，则其中将不包含科幻电影，而仅包含一部幻想电影《绿野仙踪》。在好莱坞，科幻电影对孩子来说是廉价的东西。从广义上讲，主流市场是“现实”-浪漫，喜剧，历史史诗，戏剧，战争电影和冒险故事。</p><p> If you look at a similar list today, all but three of the top films —  Titanic and two  Fast and Furious sequels — are science fiction or fantasy. That is 94 percent of the hits. That means in a 70-year period, American popular culture (and to a great degree world popular culture) went from “realism” to fantasy and science fiction. The kids’ stuff became everybody’s stuff. How did that happen? There were many significant factors, but there is no doubt that Ray Bradbury was the most influential writer involved.</p><p> 如果您今天看到类似的清单，除了三部顶级影片（《泰坦尼克号》和两部《速度与激情》续集）之外，所有影片都是科幻小说或幻想小说。那就是点击率的94％。这意味着在70年的时间里，美国的大众文化（很大程度上是世界的大众文化）从“现实主义”发展成为幻想和科幻小说。孩子们的东西变成了所有人的东西。那是怎么发生的？有许多重要因素，但毫无疑问，雷·布拉德伯里（Ray Bradbury）是其中影响力最大的作家。</p><p> It’s interesting you say this because you don’t seem to be afraid — some critics don’t want to connect popular culture or mass culture with literature or with high intellectual arts. You seem to say that Bradbury is one of those people who brought these two things to the crossroads.</p><p> 之所以说这很有趣，是因为您似乎并不害怕-一些批评家不想将大众文化或大众文化与文学或高智商艺术联系起来。您似乎说布拉德伯里就是将这两件事带到十字路口的人之一。</p><p> In my academic training, I was inculcated in the tradition of the psychological and social realist novel, the so-called “Great Tradition.” This was an extraordinary literary lineage — Austen, Eliot, Dickens, Conrad, James, Cather, Hemingway, not to mention Balzac, Stendhal, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Dostoyevsky. The realist novel was one of the great achievements of Western literature. It provided a powerful means to articulate and understand personal and social relations of enormous complexity. Three cheers for realism! Maybe even four.</p><p> 在我的学术训练中，我灌输了心理学和社会现实主义小说的传统，即所谓的“伟大传统”。这是一个非凡的文学世系-奥斯丁，艾略特，狄更斯，康拉德，詹姆斯，凯瑟，海明威，更不用说巴尔扎克，斯坦达尔，弗劳伯特，托尔斯泰，契kh夫和陀思妥耶夫斯基。现实主义小说是西方文学的伟大成就之一。它提供了一种强有力的手段来表达和理解极为复杂的个人和社会关系。现实主义的三声欢呼！甚至四个。</p><p> But there are different modes of storytelling. The most primitive is myth, where natural forces become personified in narratives. The next historical development was romance. In romantic narratives, we have the world not as it is but as we wish or fear it to be. This was the mode of medieval and Renaissance narratives. (Centuries later it also became the mode of science fiction, fantasy, horror, Gothic romance, and old-school mysteries.)</p><p> 但是讲故事有不同的模式。最原始的是神话，自然力量在叙事中变得人格化。下一个历史发展是浪漫史。在浪漫的叙事中，我们所拥有的世界并非如此，而是如我们希望或担心的那样。这是中世纪和文艺复兴时期的叙事方式。 （几个世纪后，它也成为科幻小说，幻想，恐怖，哥特式浪漫和老式神秘的模式。）</p><p> Realism is the mode that emerged last. Although the realist novel quickly became the dominant narrative form, its popularity only dates back about 400 years. The realist novel had a particular power that made it very attractive. The realist mode allowed one to see the world simultaneously from the inside and the outside. It compared — usually with a great deal of irony — the subjective experience of characters and the exterior world that surrounds them. Great novels mediate these two realities with tremendous finesse.</p><p> 现实主义是最后出现的模式。尽管现实主义小说迅速成为占主导地位的叙事形式，但它的流行仅可追溯到400年前。现实主义小说具有独特的力量，使其非常具有吸引力。现实主义模式允许人们同时从内部和外部看到世界。它比较（通常带有很大的讽刺意味）人物的主观体验和人物周围的外部世界。伟大的小说以极大的技巧调解了这两个现实。</p><p> But realism is not the only way to tell a story, and the romantic mode never vanished. Even some of the realist masters, such as Dostoyevsky, Dickens, and Balzac, found themselves exploring the mode of romance to represent certain human possibilities. Romance remained very strong in American literature with some of our most original writers — Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. But it never became academically respectable. It smacked of popular or children’s literature. As a senior at Stanford, I had to ask permission to add Mary Shelley to my reading list! (Another student asked to read H. P. Lovecraft and got a stern lecture.)</p><p> 但是现实主义并不是讲故事的唯一方法，浪漫主义的方式也从未消失。甚至一些现实主义者，例如陀思妥耶夫斯基，狄更斯和巴尔扎克，也发现自己探索浪漫主义的方式来代表人类的某些可能性。与我们一些最原始的作家埃德加·艾伦·坡和纳撒尼尔·霍桑一样，浪漫主义在美国文学中仍然保持着强大的地位。但是它从未在学术上受到人们的尊重。它散布着流行文学或儿童文学。作为斯坦福大学的高年级学生，我必须征得许可才能将Mary Shelley加入我的阅读清单！ （另一个学生要求阅读H. P. Lovecraft并作了一次严厉的演讲。） </p><p> How do you place Bradbury in this opposition of the realist and romantic traditions of storytelling?</p><p>您如何将布拉德伯里置于讲故事的现实主义和浪漫主义传统的对立面？</p><p> Bradbury never went to college — that’s one reason why he was so original. He was not indoctrinated in the mainstream assumption of the superiority of the realist mode. He educated himself. He read the books that he wanted to — from masterpieces to junk. Then he began to write children’s literature, which is to say, pulp science fiction and fantasy. But he mixed in elements from the realist tradition.</p><p> 布拉德伯里从未上过大学，这就是他如此原始的原因之一。他没有被灌输现实主义模式优越性的主流假设。他自学成才。他读了他想读的书-从杰作到垃圾。然后他开始写儿童文学，也就是纸浆科幻小说和幻想。但是他融合了现实主义传统的元素。</p><p> Then something amazing happened. In a 10-year period, Bradbury wrote seven books that changed both American literature and popular culture. They were mostly collections of short stories. Only two were true novels. In these books, for the first time in American literature, an author brought the subtlety and psychological insight of literary fiction into science fiction without losing the genre’s imaginative zest. Bradbury also crafted a particular tone, a mix of bitterness and sweetness that the genre had never seen before. (There had been earlier novels, mostly British and Russian, in which serious writers employed the science fiction mode, but those works showed the difficulty of combining the different traditions of narration. The books always resolved in dystopian prophecy.) Bradbury, for whatever reasons, was able to manage this difficult balancing act — not once but repeatedly.</p><p> 然后发生了一件令人惊奇的事情。在十年的时间里，布拉德伯里（Bradbury）写了七本书，改变了美国文学和大众文化。他们大多是短篇小说集。只有两本是真实的小说。在这些书中，作者首次在美国文学中将文学小说的微妙和心理洞察力带入科幻小说中，而又不会失去该类型的想象力。布拉德伯里（Bradbury）还精心制作了一种独特的音调，将这种类型从未有过的苦涩和甜蜜融合在一起。 （有较早的小说，其中大多数是英国和俄罗斯小说，其中严肃的作家采用科幻小说模式，但这些作品显示出难以结合叙事的不同传统。这些书总是以反乌托邦的预言解决。）布拉德伯里，无论出于何种原因，就能够处理这种困难的平衡行为-一次却一次。</p><p> What books are you thinking about here? What do you consider Bradbury’s best period?</p><p> 您在想什么书？您认为布拉德伯里的最佳时期是什么？</p><p> Sam, you’ll probably disagree with me — but I think Bradbury’s best work was mostly done in a 10-year period in the early part of his career. In one remarkable decade he wrote:  The Martian Chronicles (1950),  The Illustrated Man (1951),  The Golden Apples of the Sun (1953),  Fahrenheit 451 (1953),  The  October Country (1955),  Dandelion Wine (1957), and  A Medicine for the Melancholy (1959). The books came one right after the other, and he created a new mode of speculative fiction.</p><p> 山姆，您可能会不同意我的意见-但我认为布拉德伯里的最佳作品大部分是在他职业生涯的早期十年中完成的。在一个非凡的十年中，他写道：《火星纪事》（1950），《画报的人》（1951），《太阳的金苹果》（1953），《华氏451》（1953），《十月乡村》（1955），《蒲公英酒》（1957），和《忧郁药》（1959年）。这些书接came而来，他创造了一种新的投机小说模式。</p><p> The culture immediately recognized his achievement. Suddenly, major mainstream journals published his fiction, and producers adapted his work for movies, radio, and TV. Millions of readers, who would not have read pulp fiction, came to his work. He also became the first science fiction author to attract a large female readership.</p><p> 这种文化立即认可了他的成就。突然之间，主要的主流期刊发表了他的小说，制片人将他的作品改编成电影，广播和电视。数以百万计不会阅读纸浆小说的读者来到他的作品中。他还成为第一位吸引大量女性读者的科幻小说作家。</p><p> I don’t disagree with you in terms of that period of productivity. I might expand it by a couple of years because in ’47 he published  Dark Carnival, his first collection of short stories, which is somewhat primitive, but Stephen King called it “ Dubliners of American Gothic.” Of course, Ray revised it in 1955 into  The October Country, so it’s a little murky there. But it’s interesting that you don’t put 1962’s  Something Wicked This Way Comes into that pantheon of classic Bradbury. Why is that?</p><p> 在那段期间，我并不反对你。我可以将其扩展几年，因为在47年，他出版了《黑暗狂欢节》，这是他的第一本短篇小说集，虽然有些原始，但斯蒂芬·金称其为“美国哥特式都柏林人”。当然，雷在1955年将其修订为《十月的乡村》，所以那里有些阴暗。但是有趣的是，您没有将1962年的《邪恶的东西》这种方式放到经典的布拉德伯里的万神殿中。这是为什么？ </p><p> You may be right about  Something Wicked This Way Comes. It is the transitional book. I chose the books with the best combination of invention and finesse. The books from the early 1960s are good, but one starts to see his imaginative powers gradually weaken. Sentimentality creeps in. You could extend his golden period a few more years to include  Something Wicked This Way Comes, along with his collections  R Is for Rocket (1962) and  The  Machineries of Joy (1964). But we can’t disguise the fact that his later works taper off.</p><p>您可能对这种方式来的邪恶感到正确。这是过渡书籍。我选择了最能体现发明与技巧的书。 1960年代初的书籍不错，但人们开始看到他的想象力逐渐减弱。您可以将他的黄金时期再延长几年，包括《邪恶的东西来了》，以及他的作品《 R Is for Rocket》（1962年）和《 The Machineries of Joy》（1964年）。但是我们无法掩盖他后来的作品逐渐减少的事实。</p><p>  Sam, you and I knew Ray very well. He was one of the most generous, cordial, gracious artists I ever met. I wonder if Bradbury’s very goodness didn’t eventually temper the paranoia, ferocity, anger, and anxiety that animated his early fiction.</p><p>  山姆，你和我非常了解雷。他是我见过的最慷慨，亲切，和cious的艺术家之一。我想知道布拉德伯里（Bradbury）的善良之道是否最终不会减轻他早期小说中的偏执狂，残暴，愤怒和焦虑。</p><p> I agree that his character, avuncular kindness, generosity of spirit, and overall positive nature differed greatly from the snarl of early stories or the meanness, inherent in a take such as “All Summer in a Day.” So, I actually agree with you that his kindness might have started to take him away from the dark human commentary of his early work.</p><p> 我同意他的性格，外向的善良，精神的慷慨和整体积极的性格与早期故事的咆哮或卑鄙的行为大相径庭，例如“一天中的整个夏天”。因此，我实际上同意您的观点，即他的好意可能已经使他摆脱了早期作品中关于黑暗的人类评论。</p><p> You wrote a great essay, “Literary L.A., with No Apology,” in which you talk about your origin story with Fritz Lang and encountering him at Royce Hall. What is your Bradbury origin story? You said you picked up  The Machineries of Joy.</p><p> 您写了一篇很棒的文章《文学道歉，没有道歉》，在这篇文章中，您与弗里茨·朗谈论了自己的起源故事，并在罗伊斯·霍尔遇到了他。您的布拉德伯里血统故事是什么？您说您选择了《欢乐机械》。</p><p> Yes, that was the first hardbound book I ever bought. But I’d already been reading Bradbury for years. I was probably about 10 when I first read his work. I encountered a Bradbury story in some anthology. I searched the wire paperback racks at the local drugstore until I found  The Golden Apples of the Sun. I loved it, so I began reading all of his books, mostly borrowed from the Hawthorne library.</p><p> 是的，那是我买的第一本精装书。但是我已经读布拉德伯里多年了。当我第一次阅读他的作品时，大概大概是10岁。我在某些选集中遇到了布拉德伯里的故事。我搜索了当地药店的平装书架，直到找到了太阳的金苹果。我喜欢它，所以我开始阅读他的所有书籍，其中大部分是从霍桑图书馆借来的。</p><p> My friends read him, too. Little boys read novels back then. Bradbury became one of our foundational writers. Even at 11 or 12, we could sense he was different. He wasn’t like Isaac Asimov or A. E. van Vogt — the simple, plot-driven sci-fi we were used to. Bradbury had refined it into something subtler and more humane. We didn’t know it yet, but we were reading literature.</p><p> 我的朋友们也读过他。小男孩那时读小说。布拉德伯里成为我们的基础作家之一。即使在11点或12点，我们都可以感觉到他与众不同。他不像艾萨克·阿西莫夫（Isaac Asimov）或A. E.范·沃格特（A. E. van Vogt），这是我们习惯于以情节驱动的简单科幻小说布拉德伯里（Bradbury）将其精炼成更微妙，更人性化的东西。我们还不知道，但是我们正在阅读文学。</p><p>   Let me explain my claims for Bradbury. When I talk about his literary quality, I do not mean that  The Illustrated Man is equal to  Anna Karenina. What I’m saying is that Bradbury created a new kind of fiction, which required enormous mastery and originality. His novels and short stories opened up huge possibilities for later authors and narrative artists in all genres. This is no small thing. And his books are still widely read. Any author who writes one great novel has beaten overwhelming odds. Most writers never write anything that is read 50 years later, even the winners of literary prizes. Look at a list of Pulitzer Prize winners from 50 years ago. How many of those books have survived?</p><p>   让我解释一下我对布拉德伯里的主张。当我谈论他的文学素养时，我并不是说《图解人》等于安娜·卡列尼娜。我的意思是，布拉德伯里（Bradbury）创造了一种新型的小说，这需要巨大的掌握力和独创性。他的小说和短篇小说为以后所有类型的作家和叙事艺术家开辟了巨大的可能性。这不是一件小事。他的书仍然被广泛阅读。任何写过一部伟大小说的作家都被压倒了。大多数作家，甚至文学奖得主，也从来没有写过50年以后会读的东西。看看50年前的普利策奖得主名单。这些书中有几本幸免于难？ </p><p> That is why Bradbury’s later decline doesn’t matter. For 10 years, he was Joe DiMaggio. Every time he went to bat, there was a good chance he would hit the ball, sometimes out of the park. It’s significant that Ray’s great hitting streak came in the 1950s, a period of national optimism. Despite the anxiety, darkness, and anger in his work, Bradbury always wrote in a spirit of hope and reconciliation. He never believed humanity was beyond redemption. Perhaps as America shifted into the late 1960s and beyond, he lost touch with the culture.</p><p>因此，布拉德伯里（Bradbury）的后继衰落无关紧要。十年来，他一直是Joe DiMaggio。每次他击球时，他很有可能会击球，有时甚至会离开公园。重要的是，雷的惊人连胜出现在1950年代，这是民族乐观的时期。尽管布拉德伯里的作品充满焦虑，黑暗和愤怒，但他始终本着希望与和解的精神写作。他从未相信人类是无法救赎的。也许随着美国进入1960年代后期及以后，他与文化失去了联系。</p><p> That’s all very true. Do you have a favorite book yourself? Ray bristled at that question. He said you can’t pick a favorite child, and that all of his books were his “children.” For his readers, we all have books we attach to, either sentimentally or nostalgically, creatively, or intellectually. Do you have a favorite work by Bradbury?</p><p> 都是如此。你自己有一本最喜欢的书吗？雷对这个问题不满。他说您不能选择一个喜欢的孩子，而他所有的书都是他的“孩子”。对于他的读者，我们都有情感或怀旧，创造性或智力上的书籍。你有布拉德伯里最喜欢的作品吗？</p><p> Not a single work but a favorite form — the short story. That is where his talents burned most brightly.</p><p> 短篇小说，不是一件作品，而是一种喜欢的形式。那是他的才华最耀眼的地方。</p><p>  It’s impossible to pick a single collection. I would select two or three stories from each of the early books. The best stories stick in your imagination. They also ripple through the culture like “A Sound of Thunder,” which popularized the notion of the Butterfly Effect. Other favorites are “The Pedestrian,” “The Veldt,” and “There Will Come Soft Rains.”</p><p>  无法选择一个收藏。我将从每本早期的书中选择两个或三个故事。最好的故事留在您的想象中。它们还在“雷声”之类的文化中蔓延，并广泛传播了“蝴蝶效应”的概念。其他喜欢的人包括“行人”，“大草原”和“小雨将来”。</p><p> These stories express human desires and anxieties in ways that expose our naked psyches. I wonder if anyone has noticed that Bradbury was part of a midcentury American version of magical realism that paralleled the Latin American movement. His stories share a visionary style in which fantasy and realism intermingle similar to works such as John Cheever’s “The Swimmer,” Bernard Malamud’s “Angel Levine,” or Truman Capote’s “Miriam.” Bradbury created a cluster of myths and images for the late 20th century — situations, characters, and images that moved beyond the written word to become films, TV, comic books, theater, operas, and visual art.</p><p> 这些故事以暴露我们赤裸裸的心灵的方式表达了人类的欲望和焦虑。我想知道是否有人注意到布拉德伯里（Bradbury）是与拉美运动平行的百年美国中世纪神奇现实主义版本的一部分。他的故事具有一种幻想的风格，幻想和现实主义交织在一起，类似于约翰·谢弗（John Cheever）的《游泳者》（The Swimmer），伯纳德·马拉穆德（Bernard Malamud）的《天使·莱文》（Angel Levine）或杜鲁门·卡波特（Truman Capote）的《 Miriam》。布拉德伯里（Bradbury）在20世纪后期创造了一系列神话和图像-情景，人物和图像超越了书面文字，而变成了电影，电视，漫画，戏剧，歌剧和视觉艺术。</p><p>  Look at  The Martian Chronicles. At the height of American optimism, Bradbury wrote a bittersweet novel about the failures of science, technology, and progress. Humanity makes it to Mars, but the triumph is illusory. Mars becomes a landscape of ghost towns. The novel was an extraordinarily fertile moment in American imagination. He suggested the notion of unlimited positive progress was an illusion. His wasn’t the dystopian vision of Orwell or Zamyatin but something gentler and more elegiac. H. G. Wells could write about the end of civilization from a global perspective. Bradbury made the vision personal and lyric.</p><p>  看看《火星编年史》。在美国人的乐观情绪高涨之时，布拉德伯里（Bradbury）就科学，技术和进步的失败写了一首苦乐参半的小说。人类进入火星，但胜利是虚幻的。火星变成了鬼城的风景。这部小说在美国人的想象力中是异常丰富的时刻。他认为无限积极进步的概念是一种幻想。他不是奥威尔或Zamyatin的反乌托邦眼光，而是更温和，更讽刺的东西。 H. G. Wells可以从全球角度探讨文明的终结。布拉德伯里（Bradbury）将愿景变成个人和抒情诗。</p><p> That’s fascinating. You cite  The Martian Chronicles. If I were to pick a work that exemplifies him at his best, it might well be that book because, of course, it’s a story cycle focusing on different point of view characters in each story. I think it shows Bradbury’s incredible range. It’s also possibly his finest prose. It’s elegant, but not purple.  Something Wicked This Way Comes, even  Dandelion Wine, can venture into a little bit of flowery language, but he hit his stride with  The Martian Chronicles, as well as with his social commentary and his humanist commentary.</p><p> 令人着迷。您引用《火星编年史》。如果我要选一部能最好地表现他的作品，那可能就是那本书，因为，当然，这是一个故事循环，着重于每个故事中不同视角的人物。我认为它显示了布拉德伯里的惊人射程。这也可能是他最好的散文。优雅，但不紫色。邪恶的东西来了，甚至蒲公英酒也可以冒险进入一些绚烂的语言，但他在《火星纪事》，社交评论和人文主义评论上大步向前。 </p><p>   Martian Chronicles was his most ambitious work. As you know, Ray patterned it on  The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck’s tragic vision of Depression-era America became Ray’s Martian tragedy of human defeat. Mars became a cosmic Dust Bowl. The dispossessed farmers became doomed astronauts and interplanetary immigrants.</p><p>《火星纪事》是他最雄心勃勃的作品。如您所知，雷在《愤怒的葡萄》上饰有图案。斯坦贝克对大萧条时代的悲剧构想，成为雷·人类遭受失败的火星悲剧。火星变成了一个宇宙尘埃碗。被剥夺财产的农民注定要成为宇航员和行星际移民。</p><p> You know this history. He bought his copy of  The Grapes of Wrath coming back by Greyhound bus from the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. The World’s First Science Fiction Convention transpired at the same time, and so he was returning to Los Angeles, stopped off, briefly, at his boyhood hometown of Waukegan, which he rechristened “Greentown” in many of his works, most notably  Dandelion  Wine, and he bought his first copy of  The Grapes of Wrath after seeing it in a cigar store window, of all things. Back on the Greyhound, he traveled through America reading it in 1939. It’s incredible.</p><p> 你知道这个历史。他从1939年在纽约举行的世界博览会上乘坐灰狗巴士回购了他的《愤怒的葡萄》。同时发生了《世界第一部科幻小说大会》，因此他回到洛杉矶，短暂停留在童年时代的沃基根（Waukegan）故乡，他在许多作品中都将“格林敦”改名为“绿城”，其中最著名的是《蒲公英酒》（Dandelion Wine），在雪茄店橱窗里看到所有东西之后，他买了第一本《愤怒的葡萄》。回到灰狗，他在1939年穿越美国读书，真是太不可思议了。</p><p>   I never met him until he came to Washington to receive the National Medal of Arts. No science fiction writer had ever won the National Medal. I felt it was important to honor areas of American creativity previously ignored. (We eventually awarded medals to an animator, literary translator, set designer, comic book artist, graphic designer, electrical guitar pioneer, and cartoonist — while never neglecting the traditional fine arts.) Ray was the first of these new honorees. The first time I spoke to him was the phone call informing him about the medal. He was effusively delighted. His doctors told him not to come. Ray came anyway, in his wheelchair, with three of his daughters and yourself. He loved every moment. He was like a kid at Disneyland.</p><p>   在他来华盛顿获得美国国家艺术奖章之前，我从未见过他。没有科幻小说家曾获得国家奖章。我觉得必须纪念以前被忽略的美国创造力领域。 （我们最终授予动画师，文学翻译，布景设计师，漫画书画家，图形设计师，电吉他先驱和漫画家奖章，而从未忽略传统美术。）雷是这些新获奖者中的第一个。我第一次和他说话是打通电话，告知他有关奖牌的情况。他非常高兴。他的医生告诉他不要来。无论如何，雷带着三个女儿和你自己坐在轮椅上来了。他爱每时每刻。他就像迪斯尼乐园里的孩子一样。</p><p> This began a friendship that lasted until the end of his life. I continued to visit Ray when he was on his deathbed. He couldn’t read any longer, so I would read to him. We had a long and affectionate relationship.</p><p> 这开始了一段友谊，一直持续到他生命的尽头。当他在病床上时，我继续去拜访他。他读不懂了，所以我会读给他听。我们有长期的亲密关系。</p><p>  My favorite memory of Ray came from a science fiction convention at the University of California at Riverside. Not the convention itself but trying to get to it. Ray was the keynote speaker. He asked if I would introduce him. The speech was scheduled in a huge building at the center of campus. But there was no direct way to get Ray’s wheelchair into the building. Every entrance had high steps designed for 18-year-old college students. Our faculty hosts eventually took us around back to the service entrance by the garbage dumpsters. I pushed Ray through a series of underground corridors until we got to a huge elevator, which had been designed to bring trolleys up from the food service kitchen.</p><p>  我最喜欢Ray的记忆来自加州大学里弗赛德分校的科幻大会。不是公约本身，而是试图达成公约。雷是主旨发言人。他问我是否会介绍他。演讲原定在校园中心的一幢大楼里进行。但是，没有直接方法可以让雷的轮椅进入大楼。每个入口都有专为18岁大学生设计的台阶。最终，我们的教职员工带着垃圾箱将我们带回服务入口。我将Ray推过一系列的地下走廊，直到我们到达一台旨在将手推车从餐饮服务厨房中提起的大型电梯。</p><p> We went up a floor or two, and a group of guys from the food service came in with their packed trolleys. They were all young Mexicans speaking Spanish. They noticed this old man in a wheelchair. The professors all froze up. They felt uncomfortable. But these were the sort of guys I grew up with. I turned to them and asked in my lousy Spanish if they knew who this man was. They shook their heads. Then I told them he was “ el escritor famoso, Ray Bradbury.” My hosts looked at me as if I were crazy. But then the guys shouted, “Ray Bradbury!” Every one of them knew who he was. Then they crowded around to get his autograph.</p><p> 我们走了一两层楼，来自餐饮服务部门的一群人带着打包好的手推车进来。他们都是墨西哥年轻人，会说西班牙语。他们注意到这个坐在轮椅上的老人。教授们全都冻结了。他们感到不舒服。但是这些都是我长大的人。我转向他们，用糟糕的西班牙语问他们是否知道这个人是谁。他们摇了摇头。然后我告诉他们，他是“法学家莫雷索（Ray Bradbury）。”我的主人看着我，好像我疯了一样。但是后来伙计们喊道：“雷·布拉德伯里！”他们每个人都知道他是谁。然后他们到处拥挤以得到他的签名。</p><p>  The moment strikes me as the best measure of Bradbury’s fame. Can you imagine the same reaction, indeed any reaction, to Saul Bellow or John Updike? These immigrant workers, whom American intellectuals consider beyond the compass of literature — you know all the social, cultural, and racial barriers that exist — were part of Ray’s audience.</p><p>  这一刻让我震惊，这是布拉德伯里（Bradbury）名望的最佳体现。您能想像对Saul Bellow或John Updike的同样反应，甚至任何反应吗？这些移民工人是雷的听众的一部分，美国知识分子认为这些移民工人超出了文学的范围，您知道存在的所有社会，文化和种族障碍。 </p><p> And Ray was delighted to meet them. He chuckled and signed napkins and order slips. He had a global audience. He spoke to people novelists don’t usually reach. That is something that we should honor. Bradbury had an imagination that invited people in. I’m one of them. I know I’m not the only writer of my generation who feels Bradbury made a fundamental contribution to my intellectual and literary formation.</p><p>雷很高兴见到他们。他咯咯笑了，签了餐巾纸和订单单。他吸引了全球观众。他与小说家通常不会接触的人交谈。这是我们应该尊重的事情。布拉德伯里（Bradbury）的想象力吸引了人们的参与。我就是其中之一。我知道我不是那一代人中唯一感到布拉德伯里（Bradbury）为我的知识和文学形式做出了根本性贡献的作家。</p><p> This topic has been very important in your work for decades. At the NEA you focused on expanding reading and organized The Big Read. Bradbury participated by video in Big Read programs all over the country. I was fortunate to deliver keynote presentations at many of these events. Ray was one of these rare gateway authors for young, reluctant readers, ushering them over to more challenging works of literature. In your estimation, now that Ray is no longer with us, you’ve written about the impoverishment of American intellectual culture, how are we going to engage reluctant readers as we move forward, and avoid a post-literate society? Or are we already there?</p><p> 数十年来，这个主题在您的工作中一直非常重要。在NEA，您专注于扩大阅读范围并组织了The Big Read。布拉德伯里（Bradbury）通过视频参加了全国各地的Big Read节目。我很幸运在许多此类活动中发表了主题演讲。对于年轻的，不情愿的读者来说，雷是这些罕见的入门作家之一，将他们带入更具挑战性的文学作品中。根据您的估计，既然雷不再与我们在一起，您已经撰写了有关美国知识文化的贫困的文章，在前进的过程中，我们将如何吸引不情愿的读者，并避免文盲后的社会？还是我们已经在那里？</p><p> Our academic culture has lost its ability to inspire new readers. The decline in reading has been enormous, even among college students. At its height the Big Read was almost everywhere in the United States — every state, almost every major city plus hundreds of small towns. There were 25,000 organizations working in partnership with us. For the first time in over two decades American literary reading started growing. We made nearly 30 books available in the program, but the most popular novel was  Fahrenheit 451. It was the title teachers and librarians most often selected.  To Kill a Mockingbird was a close second. They were the gateway books, and they appealed to every age group.</p><p> 我们的学术文化失去了激发新读者的能力。即使在大学生中，阅读的下降也是巨大的。在美国，几乎每个地方都有大书房（Big Read）–每个州，几乎每个主要城市以及数百个小城镇。与我们合作的组织有25,000个。美国文学阅读在二十多年来首次开始增长。我们在该计划中提供了近30本书，但最受欢迎的小说是《华氏451》。这是最常被选择的教师和图书馆员的头衔。杀死一只知更鸟紧随其后。它们是入门书籍，对各个年龄段的人群都具有吸引力。</p><p> You can’t force young peopl</p><p> 你不能强迫年轻人</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ray-bradbury-at-100-a-conversation-between-sam-weller-and-dana-gioia/">https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/ray-bradbury-at-100-a-conversation-between-sam-weller-and-dana-gioia/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/bradbury/">#bradbury</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sam/">#sam</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/作家/">#作家</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
