Apparently it takes 3-5 months to regain sensation up there, and some people never get the feeling back. Oh well, what do you need to feel things from the top of your head for anyway?</p><p>我再也不能感受到了我的头脑。显然需要3-5个月才能重新获得感觉，有些人从未得到过的感觉。哦，嗯，​​无论如何，你需要感受到你头顶的东西？</p><p> But, it’s truly bizarre touching the top of my head and only getting feedback from my hand. Almost like touching someone else’s head except my brain knows where my hand is and seems to get confused, as if it doesn’t know how to close the loop. Proof I guess of just how connected the body and the mind are.</p><p> 但是，它真的触摸了我的头顶，只能从我的手中获得反馈。除了触摸别人的脑海之外，除了我的大脑知道我的手在哪里，似乎困惑，似乎它不知道如何关闭循环。证明我猜对身体和思想的方式是如何连接的。</p><p> Anyway, you probably want to know, what its like? What does it feel like to be awake while someone is drilling deep inside your head? Well, let me walk you through it as best as I can.</p><p> 无论如何，你可能想知道，它是什么样的？有人在脑海里深入钻孔时会醒来是什么样的？好吧，让我尽可能地通过它。</p><p>  The day began by getting this lovely looking frame bolted onto my skull. It didn’t feel as bad as it looks. They froze the areas where the bolts go so other than the weight and some added pressure around my skull I couldn’t really feel it. But, after they turned me into a cartoon supervillain, I learned that an emergency case had come in that would delay my surgery by an hour or two. So, I sat there in the cramped pre-op room staring at the other patients who were doing their best not to look horrified when we made eye contact.</p><p>  这一天开始了让这个可爱的框架螺栓穿过我的头骨。它看起来并不像看起来一样糟糕。他们冻结了螺栓的地方，除了我的头骨周围的重量和一些增加的压力，我真的无法感受到它。但是，在他们把我转变为一个卡通的潜伏者之后，我了解到，紧急情况已经进入，这将延迟我的手术一两个小时。所以，我坐在狭窄的普遍的房间里坐在那里盯着其他患者，当我们看到目光接触时，这是最好不要看起来恐惧。</p><p> Eventually I got wheeled into the OR. Like a guest of honor there were many onlookers waiting for me when I got there. In addition to the surgical team itself of at least 7 or 8 people, there were a couple rows of students who had come to watch and learn.</p><p> 最终我被转身为或。就像荣誉的客人一样，当我到达那里时，有许多等待我的旁观者。除了至少7人或8人的外科团队本身，还有几排来自于观看和学习的一系列学生。</p><p> First I was laid out on the table and had the frame locked into a much larger contraption that would keep my head securely in place no matter how much I wriggled and writhed about. Then there was about half an hour of prep that the team did in a flurry of activity happening all around me. During which time my hair was cut, but only the parts that might get in the way of the procedure, giving me that classically handsome friar tuck look. Then all sorts of sterilizing ointments were applied. Between that, the oxygen, and the mild sedatives I was given it was almost starting to feel like a trip to a spa.</p><p> 首先，我在桌子上被挑出，框架锁定到一个更大的对手中，无论我有多么蠕动和扭动，都会保持牢固地保持警惕。然后大约有大约半小时的准备，球队在我周围的一部分活动中做了一连串的活动。在此期间，我的头发被削减，但只有可能妨碍程序的零件，让我透过奇迹帅气的Friar tuck看起来。然后应用各种灭菌药膏。在那个，氧气和轻度诱人我被赋予它几乎开始觉得像水疗中心的旅行。</p><p>    Throughout the morning I had felt very ready for what I was about to experience. I’m not sure exactly what to attribute that to, but in the days preceding it my mind was completely at ease with what I was about to experience. One fear I thought I might have going in was that I would start to doubt the decision I had made.  As I wrote before, DBS was not the only option available to me. What if I got into the OR and started to second guess myself? Thankfully I never paid the thought much attention. Part of it was that I knew I was in great hands, Dr. Suneil Kalia and his team at Toronto Western Hospital are as good as it gets. It also helped that I knew I had done my homework.</p><p>    整个早晨，我觉得已经为自己的经历做好了准备。我不确定究竟是什么归因于它，但在前面的日子里，我的思想完全可以随心所欲地愉快地体验到什么。一个害怕我以为我可能进去的是，我会开始怀疑我所做的决定。正如我之前写的那样，DB不是我唯一可用的选择。如果我进入或开始第二次猜测怎么办？值得庆幸的是，我从来没有考虑过很多关注。一部分是我知道我很棒，孙子·卡利尔博士和他在多伦多西部医院的团队就像它一样好。它还帮助我知道我做了功课。 </p><p> Four years earlier on a Friday morning in Jerusalem I was wandering the halls of Hadassah medical center looking for Prof. Hagai Bergman. Friday is the start of Shabbat, the day of rest when all of Jerusalem shuts down. I wandered through the empty halls of his building wondering if I had come at the wrong time, but there he was and he seemed anxious to see me.</p><p>在耶路撒冷的星期五早上四年前，我正在寻找HAGAI BEGRMAM教授的Hadassah医疗中心大厅。星期五是沙巴特的开始，当所有耶路撒冷关闭时休息的那天。我在他的建筑物的空荡荡的大厅里徘徊，想知道我是否在错误的时间来，但他在那里，他似乎急于看到我。</p><p> He ushered me into his office and spent the next three hours taking me on a guided private tour of the basal ganglia as well as a new therapy that he was helping make a reality – closed loop deep brain stimulation. I didn’t realize it at the time but he was showing me my future.</p><p> 他迎来了他的办公室，在接下来的三个小时里花了我在基础神经节的一个导游的私人之旅以及他正在帮助的新疗法，让现实闭合的循环刺激。我当时没有意识到这一点，但他正在向我展示我的未来。</p><p> He also recommended to me a pair of books,  The Mind’s I and  I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. I’ve had them close to me ever since and often return to them. I haven’t read anything else that comes as close to explaining who and what we are, why we experience what we experience, and why we think the thoughts that we think. Some say we have no idea how DBS, or the brain for that matter, works. But, if closed loop DBS is successful, I think it would prove that while we may not ever know all the details, we do already have the right conceptual framework. We are a collection of strange loops and most of the neurological problems we face can be attributed to a break in one or more of those loops. Find the right loop or loops to close and we can fix just about anything that goes wrong.</p><p> 他还向我推荐了一双书籍，心灵的我，我是道格拉斯霍夫斯塔特的奇怪环。从那以后，我又靠近了我，经常回到他们身边。我没有阅读任何靠近解释谁以及我们所在的任何东西，为什么我们体验我们的经历，以及为什么我们认为我们认为的想法。有人说我们不知道DBS如何，或大脑如何运作。但是，如果闭环DBS成功，我认为这将证明我们可能不会知道所有细节，我们已经拥有合适的概念框架。我们是一系列奇怪的环，我们面临的大多数神经系统问题都可以归因于其中一个或多个循环中的休息。找到正确的循环或循环关闭，我们可以修复任何问题的事情。</p><p> I haven’t spoken to Prof. Bergman since, but will forever be grateful for those three hours he spent patiently explaining this new technique that I will soon be turning on inside my own head to me. Here is a taste of that lecture he gave me.</p><p> 我从伯格曼教授谈到了，但是永远不会感激他耐心地解释这种新技术，即我很快就会在我自己的前往我身边。这是他给我的讲座的味道。</p><p>    I’ll have much more to say on closed loop DBS in the future. Back to the OR.</p><p>    将来我会在封闭的循环DBS上说。回到或。</p><p> Now, as much as I believed I was ready for what I was about to experience, nothing can really prepare you for what it is like to be awake during it all. Every detail of that morning has been indelibly etched into my memory, yet I struggle to find the words to describe it. Language isn’t really suited for such things and whatever words I’ll choose to use won’t really be able to capture it. Such is life I guess.</p><p> 现在，尽管我相信我已经准备好了解了我的经历，但没有什么能够真正为你醒来的东西准备。那天早上的每个细节都被欺骗地蚀刻到我的记忆中，但我努力找到描述它的词语。语言并不适合这样的事情，无论我选择使用的单词都无法捕获它。我猜的是生活。</p><p> I’ll start with the pain, which there really isn’t that much of. The only thing that really really hurt were all the needles used to freeze my scalp, after that I didn’t really feel anything. So I was a little surprised when after the freezing they told me that they were ready to start drilling through my skull, meaning they had already sliced through all the various layers of my scalp.</p><p> 我会从痛苦中开始，这真的不是那么多。真正真正伤害的唯一真正伤害的是所有用于冻结我的头皮的针，之后我真的没有真正感受到任何东西。所以我在冻结后有点惊讶他们告诉我，他们准备开始钻探我的头骨，这意味着他们已经通过所有头皮的各个层切片了。 </p><p>  Next came the drilling of the bore holes. If there is any part of this procedure that is likely to induce trauma it is this. I will never forget that sound. Usually sound is created by your ear picking up tiny vibrations of particles in the air. But in this case the sound comes more from your entire skull shaking violently to the rotating drill boring a hole through your head. I didn’t hear it as much as I felt it, as if the entire universe was grinding together inside my skull.</p><p>接下来是钻孔的钻孔。如果此程序的任何部分可能会诱导创伤就是这样。我永远不会忘记那声音。通常由您的耳朵拾起空气中粒子的微小振动。但在这种情况下，声音更多地从整个头骨猛烈地摇晃到旋转钻孔通过头部钻孔。我没有听到它，就像我觉得一样，好像整个宇宙在我的头骨里一起磨。</p><p> Once the brain is exposed the team covered themselves and me in protective gear so they can turn on the giant stereotactic imaging device that guides the surgeon through my brain deep into my subthalamic nucleus. All of that is displayed on a screen in front of you allowing yourself and the team to see everything happening in real time. This goes by surprisingly quickly and was somewhat uneventful, though I do remembered some murmured remarks between the surgeons about avoiding a particular vein somewhere along the way.</p><p> 一旦大脑暴露，球队将自己和我一起覆盖着保护齿轮，因此它们可以打开巨型立体定影设备，通过我的脑深入地进入我的亚粒细胞核来引导外科医生。所有这些都显示在您面前的屏幕上，允许自己和团队看到实时发生的一切。这令人惊讶地令人惊讶地令人惊讶，并且有点不满，但我确实记得外科医生之间的一些低声讲话，关于避免在路上某处的特定静脉。</p><p> I did wonder, what would it be like if something went wrong. What would the reactions of the surgeons have been if they tripped that vein? All through the procedure the team sounded very calm and business like. Would the tone of their words suddenly have turned to panic? And what would I experience? Would the world suddenly go dark? Would my conscious awareness and this chain of experience I call my self suddenly shift to something else?</p><p> 我做了奇迹，如果出现问题，它会是什么样的。如果他们绊倒静脉，外科医生的反应会是什么？所有程序都通过该团队响起，非常平静和商业。他们的话语突然转向恐慌吗？我会遇到什么？世界会突然变暗吗？我有意识的意识和这种经验链，我称自己突然转向别的东西吗？</p><p> Anyway, once it looks like it is in the right spot, which you can tell by the lead penetrating the crosshairs on the screen, they began the microelectrode recording. They played the live sound on a speaker which emitted the different sounds of each cortical layer as it went deeper and deeper. Throughout the procedure I was talking and lucid. Lobbing question after question at the team, here Dr. Kalia had to tell me to shut up so they could listen and confirm they were in the right spot.</p><p> 无论如何，一旦它看起来就像它在正确的位置，你可以通过领先的铅穿过屏幕上的十字线，他们开始微电极记录。他们在扬声器上播放了现场声音，当它更深入和更深时，发出了每个皮质层的不同声音。在整个过程中，我正在说话和清醒。在团队中追踪问题的问题，在这里，Kalia博士不得不告诉我闭嘴，所以他们可以倾听并确认他们在正确的位置。</p><p> The crescendo slowly builds until it reaches the target and then the sound of hundreds of thousands of your own neurons excitedly relaying the information they carry to one another fills the room. This was the most intimate moment of the day. My brain was speaking to me, though in a language “I” could not understand. And even though I knew there was some perturbation in that sound that was responsible for the symptoms I felt, I smiled thinking of all that was going right inside me.</p><p> Crescendo慢慢地建造，直到它到达目标，然后兴奋地转发了数十万个自己的神经元的声音，他们互相中继彼此的信息填补了房间。这是当天最亲密的时刻。我的大脑对我说话，但在语言中“我”无法理解。即使我知道那些对我觉得的症状负责的声音有一些扰乱，我笑着思考在我内心的所有东西。</p><p>     Once they confirmed they were in the desired position the stimulation was turned on. It was in the left hemisphere of my brain which controls the right side of my body. I was asked to do a few simple movement tasks with my hands like tapping my index finger and thumb together as quickly as possible and pretending to turn a doorknob. It was roughly noon and I had not taken any medication up to that point. Normally if I had gone till noon without any medication I would have had a pronounced tremor, the tapping would have been very slow and labored, and I would have barely been able to turn my wrist over and back. But at that moment I felt as though I had travelled back in time eight years to before my diagnosis. My fingers and my wrist moved fluidly. It was liberating. I was back in control. Despite being strapped to a table with my head in a giant vice I felt euphoric. This disease had suddenly and magically dissipated. Nothing short of a modern medical miracle.</p><p>     一旦他们确认它们处于所需的位置，刺激被打开。它是我大脑的左半球，控制着我身体的右侧。我被要求用手做一些简单的运动任务，就像尽可能快地敲击我的食指和拇指一样，假装转动门把手。它粗略地是中午，我没有达到这一点的药物。通常，如果我才到中午没有任何药物治疗，我会有一个明显的震颤，攻丝会非常缓慢和努力，我几乎没有能够背回手腕。但在那一刻，我觉得好像我在诊断前八年地赶到了八年。我的手指和我的手腕流动地移动了。它很解放。我被控制了。尽管我的头在一个巨大的副本中被绑在一张桌子上，但我觉得欣喜若狂。这种疾病突然而神奇地消散。没有任何现代医学奇迹。</p><p> But it was short lived as I was then reminded that the entire process needed to be repeated for the other side. Now the novelty of the whole experience wore off and I started to really feel the weight of the frame tying me down. I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth and got through it. But not without the whole thing taking its toll. A mix of nausea and a shearing headache crept over me that slowly grew in intensity. I wanted to tell them not to bother with getting this side as precise as possible, to just hurry up and get it all over with as quickly as they could.</p><p> 但随着我的意愿，它很短暂地提醒说，需要为另一边重复整个过程。现在整个经验的新颖性困扰着，我开始真正觉得框架的重量让我搞砸了。我闭上眼睛，咬紧牙关并通过它。但并非没有整体才能收费。混合物的恶心和剪毛头痛悄然在于，慢慢增长。我想告诉他们不要因为尽可能精确而让这一方烦恼，只要匆匆忙忙，尽快得到它。 </p><p> There is a lot more I could say about the whole ordeal, including the tunneling of the wires through my neck and the placement of the battery in my chest two days later, but I’ll leave it at that for now. It has been 12 days since the operation and I am feeling much better than I would have expected, though not entirely like myself either. In less than a month I should begin programming the device which hopefully will make everything I experienced worthwhile. I’m not sure exactly what I’ll do if, once we get all the parameters right, they flick that switch and I get to permanently return to that state I felt when they turned on the stimulation in the OR, but suffice it to say that I am looking forward to getting there.</p><p>我可以在两天后通过我的脖子和电池放置电动机的隧道，包括两天的隧道，并在两天后的隧道放置。自操作以来已经12天，我感觉比我预期的要好得多，虽然也没有完全像我自己。在不到一个月内，我应该开始编程，该设备希望能使我经历的一切值得注意。我不确定我会做什么，如果我们获得所有参数，他们会轻弹那个切换，我会永久地返回到那个状态，当他们打开刺激时，我感到难以说我期待着到达那里。</p><p> The last thing I’ll show is the MRI I had taken the day after. The white dots you see on the left is the inflammation surrounding the holes that were drilled. I close my eyes and wonder how all the cells surrounding that spot must be reacting, all the neurons trying to communicate with this foreign object, all the glial cells now busily forming the scar tissue that will lock those long leads you see on the right in place for the rest of my life.</p><p> 我展示的最后一件事就是我在后一天的MRI。您在左侧看到的白点是围绕钻孔的炎症。我闭上眼睛，奇异地掩盖了那种斑点的所有细胞必须如何做出反应，所有的神经元都试图与这种异物沟通，所有的胶质细胞现在繁忙地形成了疤痕组织，这将锁定在右边的那些长长的领导在余生的地方。</p><p>  Soon enough the stimulator will be turned on and the contacts will be activated, hopefully restoring mobility to this strange loop that I am.</p><p>  很快就会打开刺激器，并将激活联系人，希望将移动性恢复到我所在的这种奇怪的循环。</p><p>   I am very pleased that your operation appears to have gone welll; You will be looking foreward to switching it on no doubt. Keith</p><p>   我很高兴你的操作似乎已经康复了;毫无疑问，您将在前面展示，以切换它。基思</p><p>    As usual. Great post! You are an inspiration and good luck turning on the juice soon, best wishes, Frank</p><p>    照常。伟大的帖子！你是一个灵感和好运，很快就会打开果汁，祝福，坦诚</p><p>  This was a fascinating post to read as a neurosurgery resident. Thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope DBS works out for you.</p><p>  这是一个作为神经外科居民阅读的迷人帖子。谢谢您分享您的体验，我希望DBS为您提供工作。</p><p>  The human body is an incredible, complex, designed piece of artistry. May you go forth with renewed joy and gratefulness for this wonderful second chance of life.</p><p>  人体是一种令人难以置信的复杂设计的艺术性。愿你在这个美妙的第二次生活机会的生活机会中，你愿意再次喜悦和感激。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://tmrwedition.com/2021/06/13/the-agony-and-the-ecstacy-of-deep-brain-stimulation-surgery/">https://tmrwedition.com/2021/06/13/the-agony-and-the-ecstacy-of-deep-brain-stimulation-surgery/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/性脑/">#性脑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/awake/">#awake</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
