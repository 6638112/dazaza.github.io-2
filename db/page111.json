I really wanted to keep this as quiet as possible, but I don&#39;t feel I can anymore. Here&#39;s my side of what happened.  On an exchange like MtGox, there are typically hundreds of standing &#34;buy orders&#34; where people are offering to buy bitcoins at various amounts and prices. When a large sell order comes in, an exchange will start with the highest priced buy order, match up the buyer and seller, then move down to the next lowest buy order. This repeats until the entire quantity of bitcoins being sold have found buyers, or there are no more buyers at the minimum price the seller was willing to accept.  I was watching, like many of you, a gigantic sell order burning through the bids. Mt Gox doesn&#39;t execute trades very quickly, so we were watching this huge order slowly eat up every buy order on the books. The price started at around $17.50, and within minutes was below $10. At this point, I realized this wasn&#39;t merely a large seller willing to accept some losses. This was someone attempting to crash the market by selling a huge percentage of the market&#39;s total bitcoins at once.  I had around $3000 USD in my Mt Gox account, from earlier sales I&#39;d made. I looked at the market stats, and realized that there were tons of orders to buy BTC at $0.01 that would likely eat up any remaining bitcoins this seller had on the order. I figured if I put a buy order in for $0.0101, my order would execute first and I could buy a huge amount of bitcoins from this seller before it hit the bottom. The only problem was that Mt Gox was running slower than molasses at the time, and everyone was saying that it wasn&#39;t accepting trades. I had to try several times, but eventually I got a buy order in, offering to buy as many bitcoins as I could for $0.0101.  The site stopped responding completely for a while, probably from so many people hitting refresh to see what was going on. When I got back in, I saw in my account:   06/19/11 17:51\u00a0 Bought BTC\u00a0 259684.77 for 0.0101  I had just purchased over 250,000 bitcoins for $2613. At the trading price immediately before this large sell order happened, that number would have been worth nearly $5 million. After I regained my breath, I tried to figure out what to do. I wasn&#39;t sure what was really going on. Over the past few days there had been a lot of talk and complaints about Mt Gox&#39;s security. Lists of Mt Gox usernames, email addresses and encrypted passwords were being traded around, which was an obvious sign that security at Mt Gox had been breached in some way. If there was an attacker in the system, perhaps he was able to log into my account now and force my account to execute some other crazy trade.  I attempted to withdraw the bitcoin balance into my own wallet, and hit the limit that Mt Gox has, preventing you from withdrawing more than $1000 USD worth of bitcoins (at the current market value) in a day. This transferred 643.27 bitcoins to my personal bitcoin account before hitting that limit. It was pretty well known that the limit for transferring bitcoins was actually broken in Mt Gox. It stopped you from moving more than that in one withdrawal, but you could immediately ask for more and get another $1000 USD worth, over and over. I decided against this, since it was exploiting a bug, and I definitely didn&#39;t want to do anything suspicious looking or improper.   The thought also occurred to me that there were only about 100 bitcoins worth of buy orders back on the market in the minutes immediately following all of this. I could place a reasonably sized sell order for $0.001, crash the market again, and withdraw probably all of the bitcoins, since they&#39;d be valued at $0.001 each and would fit under the $1000 USD limit. I also decided against this, when I realized that whoever placed the gigantic sell order was probably doing so for the exact same reasons and I knew how that would make me look.  I then sent an private message on IRC to MagicalTux (Mark Karpeles, the founder of Mt Gox) to explain that I was the one who won the giant buy order, and that I wasn&#39;t the same person as whoever placed the huge sell order. We&#39;d talked previously, including a private talk a couple of days ago about Mt Gox&#39;s &#34;change my password&#34; system not working. He didn&#39;t respond to me at all, but I figured he was busy. A few minutes later he was saying in public that he&#39;d decided to reverse all the recent trades, effectively undoing the final 3602 trades that were executed before he shut the site down.  We talked a bit, and I started to become increasingly concerned with what Mt Gox was saying in public which was totally contradicting what I knew to have happened. The Mt Gox status page said:    &#34;One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.&#34;\n There are three very misleading elements in that line alone.  First, this makes it sound like the &#34;hacker&#34; is the one who was buying back all the bitcoins at a penny. We all were watching the trades execute in real time, there was only one buy order of anywhere near the size of the huge sell order that went through, and I was the buyer not the hacker. Other people in IRC were saying which other buy orders they were able to get. The hacker couldn&#39;t have been able to buy back even 10% of the bitcoins that were sold during the sell-off. Did this mean Mark thought *I* was the hacker? I have repeatedly asked him this question, which he&#39;s managed to ignore each time.  Recently I&#39;ve been getting into the bitcoin trading market. Over the last couple of weeks, I was hitting the $1000 USD Dwolla cash withdrawal limit from Mt Gox, so I requested that it be increased. I sent Mt Gox a copy of my driver&#39;s license and two utility bills in my name/address to prove my identity, which Mark accepted and increased my limit. Could that have been faked? Sure. But, if I was the hacker I was going about this whole thing stupidly. I had several ways I could have drained the Mt Gox account, and deliberately didn&#39;t. I immediately contacted Mark to identify myself as the buyer and offer assistance. If I were up to something shady, I was doing a really bad job at it.  The second thing wrong with Mt Gox&#39;s statement is that it makes it sound like only the hacker managed to withdraw any money, and even then only $1000 worth. I alone withdrew 643 bitcoins (worth more than $10,000 USD easily). The withdrawal limit feature was so broken, it was hard to imagine the hacker didn&#39;t know how to exploit it.  On top of how misleading I felt they were being about what I knew occurred, I felt it was far worse that they were using this argument for why they wanted to undo the trades. From reading their public statements, they&#39;re making it sound like they&#39;re reverting the trades because they want to prevent a hacker from profiting from it. This is simply not true, the vast majority, if not all of the buy orders that picked up coins at a low price were regular users like myself. Any profit this hacker was going to make, he&#39;s already done so. The majority of the buy orders that got executed were standing orders from legit users that had been in the system for quite some time, and those are the orders he&#39;s threatening to revert.  And this is where I, like others here, have a problem. Of course I am greatly biased here, but look at what&#39;s going on:   1)  Rolling back/Breaking trades is something Mt Gox said they wouldn&#39;t do.  Many exchanges will break trades if something truly unusual happened, but there&#39;s a policy listed in advance so everyone knows how, when and why it will kick in. Mt Gox never claimed they felt they had the authority to undo trades, in fact the Mt Gox website states:    &#34;You are trading with other users of Mt Gox. Mt Gox does not act as a counter party to any trades.&#34;\n Claiming that Mt Gox isn&#39;t a &#34;counter party&#34; to trades has a specific legal meaning. Typically market participants, stock brokers and other associated people are &#34;counter parties&#34; or &#34;central counter parties&#34; to trades, taking on the burden of insuring trades were executed properly. Put simply, Mt Gox was saying in legal terms they were only acting as a match maker between buyers and sellers, not involving themselves in any issues that may come up from the trades themselves.  If they&#39;re claiming they have no responsibility for what occurs, that means they don&#39;t get to flex any control over it. You&#39;re either merely introducing buyers and sellers to each other and have no liability or power over what happens after that point, or you are a central counter party to the trade and do get to make those decisions. Mt Gox is trying to have it both ways, after telling us that they didn&#39;t want the responsibility. No rollback policy was ever published or even discussed anywhere I could find.    2)  Mt Gox had been repeatedly warned about password security issues recently, and continued to reassure us everything was safe.  An exchange cannot be allowed to reassure customers of their security and fail to accept responsibility when it is proven to be insecure. As customers of Mt Gox, we cannot have the same visibility into their systems that they do and must rely on their word that the exchange is trustworthy. If exchanges are allowed to repeatedly tell us we can rely on their trading platform, fail at securing it, then be given a blank check to remove funds from anyone they desire to make themselves whole again, no exchange has any incentive to secure themselves.   3)  The precedent they&#39;re setting here cannot be maintained.  Exactly what happened here may never be fully known, but according to Mt Gox an unauthorized user accessed someone&#39;s account and placed a sell order. Passwords get guessed/leaked all the time, and any exchange that attempts to undo that in every case will undoubtably fail.   If I&#39;m careless with my password and someone places orders on my behalf in my account without my permission, will Mt Gox revert an hour&#39;s worth of trading to fix it? What if I only had 2 bitcoins? Or 20? or 200? There is no way rolling back trades to handle a compromised password in any way that will scale to the size of bitcoin&#39;s current economy. Unless Mt Gox is wiling to explicitly say they&#39;ll give this same treatment to any user who has their account compromised, it&#39;s blatantly unfair to everyone else.   This also opens the door to allowing anyone to request equal treatment if they made some trades they later regret. Log in through a proxy to make it seem like someone from a distant country was using your account, make your trades, then later scream about how your account was compromised and you want a do-over.   4)  The whole situation seems fishy once you know everything thats been made public.  Mt Gox&#39;s story is requiring extreme leaps of faith to believe. They have insisted that only one account was accessed. This means they expect us to believe:  \u00a0* A Mt Gox user had more than 500,000 bitcoins stored in their Mt Gox account (more than $8 million by Sunday&#39;s prices). \u00a0* This user chose a password that was able to be guessed by a password cracker from the encrypted hash of their pass. (This means their password was likely quite simple) \u00a0* This user managed to amass this many bitcoins without being involved in the community enough to hear everyone screaming about the password file being leaked to the world. \u00a0* Mark claimed to me that police reports were filed in less than an hour after Mt Gox&#39;s trading was halted. \u00a0* The decision to roll back trades was announced within minutes of them investigating. \u00a0* Mt Gox&#39;s public statements have been, at best, misleading.  All of this is so implausible that I can&#39;t help but believe we are not being told the whole story. I am  not implying that I believe Mt Gox is acting dishonorably, but that if they don&#39;t respond to this sort of thing, people will start jumping to worse conclusions.  If I had $8 million worth of easily convertible currency, there is absolutely no way I would store it on a public website like Mt Gox, no matter how secure I believed it was. If I had to store that much there, even temporarily, I would use a password so long it would make War and Peace look like a Twitter message.   Is the account owner a friend or investor in Mt Gox?\u00a0 The account owner managed to get decisions made and a police report filed faster than I was able to get a response out of Mark. If there is some kind of connection between the account owner at Mt Gox, this needs to be fully disclosed and explained before any actions are taken, or any trust in what Mt Gox does is going to be shattered.  I am not actually accusing Mt Gox of scamming us or anything, but asking their users to accept over 500,000 BTC in orders to be reversed due to a story that has some serious holes in it, greatly benefits an anonymous account holder, and has some elements that are provably false is simply unacceptable.   5)  Claims that they want to revert to protect the market are false.  Again, unless there are major pieces of the story missing, the hacker has already gotten away with whatever they were going to. Secure the compromised account with a better password and that matter is closed.  Mt Gox&#39;s website was severely affected by the large sell order, very very few new sell orders made it into the system. A few people did get some panic sells in during the freefall, but they were tiny in comparison to the volume of the big sell that started the mess.  The majority of the &#34;buy&#34; orders that got executed were long standing buy orders that were already in the system. Those people, before any crash started, told the system of their intent to buy at specific prices, and those agreements were honored. At worst, buyers got exactly what they already agreed to purchase, at best got a good deal.  The market made a 70% recovery within minutes, and was continuing to trend upwards before Mt Gox halted trading and shut their web server down.  The only parties that need to be involved in this are Mt Gox and the original account owner to determine if any unauthorized trades were actually made from their account, and how Mt Gox is going to make it up to them.   6)  Mt Gox has several options before them, and are choosing to screw over the community to protect their profit.  I&#39;ve seen people throwing around three options:  Option 1: Rollback all trades.  + The guy who chose to store $8m in bitcoins on a public website gets the majority of his money back + Mt Gox is out very little ? Sellers who placed a panic sell during the freefall get a free undo. - This sets a precedent that trades can be reversed, which increases risk and will likely result in some players want to wait for their trades to &#34;clear&#34; before taking further action making us no better than using PayPal. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Buyers who had both new and long time orders that were executed are getting them revoked by a policy that didn&#39;t exist yesterday. - Had I not decided to &#34;do the right thing&#34; and leave the funds in Mt Gox, this wouldn&#39;t even be an option.  Option 2: Mt Gox tells the account owner &#34;tough luck&#34; and does nothing.  + Everyone else who placed orders will be unaffected - The account owner that got hacked is facing massive losses from something that may have not been completely their fault. - This gives strong incentive for traders to immediately withdraw funds after a trade, which will greatly reduce liquidity. - Mt Gox ends up earning their trading fees off someone&#39;s loss that they were likely partially or fully responsible for.  Option 3: Mt Gox takes responsibility, and reimburses the original account owner&#39;s account to the best of their ability.  + The exchange is forced to deal with the consequences of their negligent lapse in security + Faith in the trading market would be largely restored if not increased + Buyers who placed orders that were executed get what they paid for + Mt Gox has clearly made several times more revenue (through trading fees) than this incident would cost them to completely absorb. + If this became an expected feature of an exchange, only exchanges that actually protected our accounts would survive. + Mt Gox is the only party that can go after the auditor that they are claiming was responsible for this incident - It is uncertain if Mt Gox actually has that much liquid reserve to do this fully.  I am publicly asking Mt Gox to explain why they are unwilling to go for Option 3. They&#39;re choosing the option that costs them the least, protecting this mystery user at the expense of the entire bitcoin community. Their decision will result it everyone refusing to keep balances in the exchange for fear that profitable trades will be lost at the whim of the exchange owner. You&#39;ve heard my story, if you make a sudden windfall trade that nets you a good profit, how long are you going to let Mt Gox hold onto it, out of fear they&#39;re going to claim it was invalid? If everyone is doing this, where is the money going to come from to make trades?   I realize a lot of this is going to fall on deaf ears who think Im only doing this for my own profit. Id believe this no matter what, but I probably wouldnt be fighting so passionately if I didnt have some stake in it.  I made a bunch of attempts to try to come up with some kind of mutually agreed on plan with the Mt Gox people, only to get stalled (they won&#39;t even talk to me until I sent them notarized copies of my photo ID on a Sunday?). I&#39;d like to end as much uncertainty as I can, so this is my side. We all have opportunities to totally disrupt the market. I could threaten legal action which would cause an even bigger run on their reserves. Mt Gox could close their doors and take everyone&#39;s cash.

Of the 139 million Americans who have become fully vaccinated since December, a mere 3,459 (0.000024 per cent)  have suffered a serious COVID-19 infection in spite of vaccination.\n    The couple were leaving a state of 10 million people that was now counting  record-low case rates of only 300 infections per day. Comprehensive infection data from Israel, meanwhile, has shown that people like the Floridas are now  94 per cent less likely to transmit the virus to others. And on top of everything, they both showed up at the border with negative COVID-19 test results.\n    The Government of Canada did not care. The couple was forced into mandatory 14-day home quarantine and supervised by \u201c10 or 20\u201d phone calls per day from quarantine officers \u2014 as well as regular in-person visits.\n  It seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest\n  \u201cIt seems like you would want to deploy those resources better than just sort of being a pest,\u201d Florida told the National Post.\n  Florida is but one of thousands of people now caught in a latticework of Canadian COVID-19 restrictions that have ceased to have any relationship to reality. As COVID-19 goes into full retreat across the country, Canadian governments are stubbornly adhering to restrictions that are not only pointless, but incur a daily tithe of debt, closed businesses and lockdown-related fatalities. At a time when Canada should be casting off the shackles of one of its most damaging single events,\u00a0 entrenched interests seem bent on seeing it continue.\n  . @ranaflorida &amp; I just got a visit from Canadian public health authorities checking on our quarantine. We are now being observed doing our Day 8 online Covid test. We are both fully vaccinated. Is it crazy to think such precious public health resources could be put to better use\n\u2014 Richard Florida (@Richard_Florida)  June 16, 2021\n    On Thursday,  only 12 people in Canada died from COVID-19. For context, in a typical year 19 Canadians  can be expected to die every day from flu or pneumonia. In that same average day, 17 will die of Alzheimers, 38 will be killed in accidents and 11 will die by suicide.\n    In much of the country, the risks from COVID-19 have now been definitively outstripped by Canada\u2019s other public health emergency: the opioid crisis. Two Albertans died of COVID-19 on Thursday. By contrast, in just the first two months of 2021 Alberta saw an  average of four fatal overdoses per day.\n    Canada now has one of the lowest rates of per-capita COVID-19 fatalities in the entire G20. At the end of this week, the average citizen of the European Union is now  61 per cent more likely to die of COVID-19 than the average Canadian, even though the case rates in both places are  roughly the same. And while the rise of the Delta variant has spurred worry, it is proving to be just as resilient to vaccination as any other strain of COVID-19.\n  COVID-free for the first time since March 26, 2020! \ud83c\udf89 This is the first time the MSICU at Toronto General does not have any COVID patients. We are very grateful for the extraordinary MSICU team!  #ThankYou  pic.twitter.com/LGmNsF8snY\n\u2014 University Health Network (@UHN)  June 16, 2021\n    On every front, Canada\u2019s pandemic is speeding towards its end: A fast-tracked and innovative national  vaccine strategy has bought Canadians deliverance from COVID-19 faster than almost anyone thought possible.\n  The country now has the world\u2019s second-highest rate of first-dose vaccine coverage, and 4.8 million people are now fully vaccinated \u2014  including half of all Canadians over the age of 80.\n  The country\u2019s reward for this epidemiological miracle? A continued lockdown on commerce and civic life that, in many ways, is indistinguishable from the summer of 2020, when a vaccine still seemed a distant pipe dream and more than two thirds of the country\u2019s 26,000 COVID fatalities had yet to die.\n    For more than a year, schools have been identified around the world as negligible vectors for COVID-19 transmission, in large part because the virus  has such a hard time sticking to children. Regardless, Ontario schools have remained under indefinite closure since April, despite  even a May 29 statement from Ontario\u2019s own COVID-19 Science Advisory Table saying that the province \u201ccan re-open schools safely.\u201d\n    The Government of Ontario had promised that as soon as 70 per cent of adults reached first-dose vaccination, the province would legalize hair salons, outdoor amusements and tables of up to six people at outdoor restaurants \u2014 all of which have been allowed for months in many other regions of North America. Even with Ontario now at 75 per cent vaccination coverage, a government-mandated interval of three weeks means that hair salons will continue to remain shuttered until July.\n  \u201cEvery single \u2026 hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever,\u201d Dan Kelly, CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, wrote in a Thursday Tweet.\n  Every single day, hour lockdowns continue, more small business owners make the decision to close their doors forever. Yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the capacity for small firms to hang on is extremely limited.\n\u2014 Dan Kelly (@CFIB)  June 17, 2021\n    But the most overzealous COVID strictures can be found at the Canadian border. The federal government  has put in plans to lift its mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers \u2014 but not until July. And even then, incoming travellers must continue to provide two negative COVID-19 tests regardless of vaccination status \u2014 a requirement well beyond the pale of almost any other Western nation.\n  As a renowned urban theorist, Florida can usually be heard talking up his adoptive Toronto home as a haven for what he calls the \u201ccreative class\u201d \u2014 the scientists, engineers, tech investors and others who help invigorate urban economies.\n  Now, as Florida\u2019s usual world of conferences, summits and book tours start up again, he  faces fines and even jail time if he so much as steps outside for a walk before his quarantine ends on Tuesday. He suspects he\u2019s not the only one thinking hard about whether it\u2019s still possible for him to do his job from Canadian soil.\n  Yup same story, we are on day 13 of quarantine and tomorrow is our last day.  An official actually showed up on day 7. He agreed with us that it is pointless we are quarantining despite being fully vaccinated (and 2 negative tests), but he is just doing his job \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u2014 Avinash Collis (@avi_collis)  June 15, 2021\n    \u201cThis is literally like hanging out a sign and saying \u2018global talent, we\u2019re kind of on the fence about you,\u2019\u201d he told the National Post.\n  Canada\u2019s hesitance on reopening also risks leaving whole sectors of the economy out of the global rebound, including the country\u2019s  $100 billion-per-year tourism industry. As early as February, Poland lifted its quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated tourists. France opened its borders to vaccinated visitors earlier this month. As of this writing,  more than 30 countries are jumpstarting their tourism industries with special provisions for vaccinated travellers \u2014 particularly those from the heavily vaccinated U.S.\n  Canada, by contrast, just extended its non-essential travel ban with the U.S.  until at least July 21, ostensibly to keep \u201cCanadians safe,\u201d according to a statement by Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair. The borders similarly remain closed to everyone else looking to take a Canadian vacation, regardless of their vaccination status. \u201cYou can\u2019t enter Canada for discretionary travel,\u201d reads a blunt declaration on the Government of Canada\u2019s  official information page for foreign visitors.\n  Our number one priority as we fight  #COVID19 is keeping Canadians safe. In coordination with the U.S., we are extending restrictions on non-essential international travel and with the United States until July 21st, 2021.\n\u2014 Bill Blair (@BillBlair)  June 18, 2021\n    Not only is this shutting out yet another summer for Canada\u2019s bankruptcy-plagued tourism sector, but it risks permanently altering long-established travel patterns. Canada\u2019s refusal to reopen its ports to even fully vaccinated cruise vessels, for instance, has spurred a legislative push in the U.S. to encourage cruise operators to  bypass Canadian ports permanently.\n  \u201cCanada\u00a0cannot afford to be left behind as other countries around the world begin to reopen,\u201d Susie Grynol, president of the Hotel Association of\u00a0Canada,  said in a statement this week.\n  But while overzealous Canadian lockdowns may be progressively losing touch with scientific evidence, it would be wrong to say that they\u2019re necessarily against public opinion.\n    A  June 9 poll by Maru Public Opinion found that 69 per cent of Ontarians approved of school closures. And despite living within North America\u2019s most locked-down jurisdiction, half approved of the performance of Premier Doug Ford. An Angus Reid Institute poll released the same day wasn\u2019t nearly as warm towards Ford, but it nevertheless found that Ontarians  approved of his performance on COVID more than any other single file, including the economy, healthcare and education.\n  As the U.S. crawls out of its pandemic, American communities have reached out to Canadians with a wave of good neighbourliness. Communities in Alaska, Montana and Washington State have even offered extra vaccine doses to Canadian towns across the border to speed up reopening.\n  The Blackfeet Nation in Montana gifted their surplus COVID-19 vaccines (750 doses) to nearby residents in Alberta, Canada.

The dish &#34;overheated&#34; and &#34;Starlink will reconnect after cooling down,&#34; the error message said:\n  The user, named Martin, posted a screenshot of the  error message on Reddit. He contacted Starlink support, which told him, &#34;Dishy will go into thermal shutdown at 122F and will restart when it reaches 104F.&#34;\u00a0Martin decided to give the dish a little water so it could cool down. He pointed a sprinkler at Dishy, and once it cooled enough to turn back on, &#34;I immediately heard YouTube resume playback,&#34; he wrote yesterday.\n  &#34;The fix was temporary,&#34; he told us. &#34;When I stopped the sprinkler, [the dish] heated back up and would cycle back on for a few minutes and go back down for thermal shutdown. The overheating started that day about 11:30am and came back for good about 7pm... I&#39;m currently headed to a hardware store to get materials to build a solar shade/sail around the dish to see if it doesn&#39;t impact connection and speed.&#34;\n Martin uses the ground behind his house to set up his dish because it is the only spot with no obstructions. But there&#39;s &#34;no shade to speak of,&#34; he wrote in the Reddit comment thread.\n  Officially,  SpaceX has said that &#34;Dishy McFlatface&#34; is\u00a0certified to operate from 22\u00b0 below zero up to 104\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Temperatures reached about 120\u00b0 yesterday in Martin&#39;s town of Topock, near Arizona&#39;s border with California, he said. Though Dishy doesn&#39;t go into thermal shutdown until it hits 122\u00b0, the dish can obviously get hotter than the air temperature.\n &#34;I&#39;m thinking the radiating heat from the ground is effectively cooking the bottom of the dish, [while] the top of the dish is cooked by the sun,&#34; Martin told Ars. In addition to the shade he&#39;s building, Martin said he is &#34;waiting for permitting for a HAM radio tower&#34; that would lift the dish off the ground to help keep it cool enough to operate.\n Martin said he also had very short outages on several days since last week, but service came back before he had time to confirm whether they were caused by heat. SpaceX told users to expect periodic outages during beta, so Martin&#39;s previous outages could have been due either to heat or satellite availability.\n  Another user in Virginia experienced a half-hour outage due to overheating on a day with temperatures in the low 80s, according to a  Reddit post two months ago.\n Martin&#39;s post spurred a response from a beta user who also reported thermal shutdowns. &#34;You&#39;re not the only one. My Starlink is located 50 miles south of Grand Canyon in remote area,&#34; one person wrote yesterday. &#34;It&#39;s been off and on also. It stopped today one hour after cool down period but quit again as [of] ~12:30. Last reported temp at my weather station was 103 degrees.&#34;\n The 122\u00b0 F shutdown temperature was mentioned three weeks ago in a\u00a0 Reddit post by a user who had also been given the figure by Starlink support. &#34;&#39;That&#39;s it??&#39; was my thought. On a 90 degree day, the rooftop of my house can be around 125 degrees,&#34; that user wrote.\n &#34;Are you sure that wasn\u2019t Celsius?&#34; another asked. (122\u00b0 C converts to 251.6\u00b0 F.)\n Like Martin, other Starlink users may have to find creative ways to keep their dishes cool as the summer months arrive.\n  As we  wrote in December, a teardown of Dishy McFlatface showed some of its heat-management components, including a metal shield that&#39;s peppered with blue dots made of thermally conductive material that conducts heat away from the PCB and into the shield.\n Ken Keiter, the engineer who performed the teardown, was interviewed by Vice&#39;s Motherboard section for a  story about the Arizona resident today:\n Keiter told Motherboard that while reasonable consideration was given to heat dissipation in Dishy&#39;s design, he could see the potential for problems.\n &#34;The phased array assembly comprises a PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) adhered to an aluminum backplate which serves several purposes\u2014acting as RF shielding, providing structural rigidity and, most relevantly, acting as a radiative thermal mass (heat sink) for the components on the PCBA,&#34; Keiter said.\n Heat is funneled from the circuit board to the aluminum backplate using a foam-like thermal interface material (TIM). The backplate itself resides in a weather-sealed cavity containing a small amount of air. As this backplate heats up, the air surrounding it also heats, transferring thermal energy via the plastic enclosure to the outside environment, Keiter said.\n &#34;Here&#39;s the problem: at some point, the combined thermal energy being absorbed by Dishy&#39;s face and being dumped by the components into the backplate, the air surrounding it, and the enclosure exceeds the amount that is being dissipated to the outside environment,&#34; he noted.\n Keiter said that software changes could &#34;make the system more thermally efficient&#34; but that it&#39;s possible SpaceX will need to make &#34;a significant hardware revision for the commercial launch.&#34; He called it &#34;a really tricky engineering problem with some insanely tight constraints.&#34;\n   The Starlink public beta  began in October 2020, and there&#39;s still no word on when exactly it will hit commercial availability. But the service could happen within months as SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has  said that Starlink will be available to &#34;most of Earth&#34; by the end of 2021 and the whole planet by next year. Still, SpaceX expects to have a limited number of slots in each geographic region because of capacity constraints.\n SpaceX is seeking Federal Communications Commission permission to deploy up to 5 million user terminals in the US. Over 500,000 people have ordered Starlink, and  Musk has said he expects all of those users to get service. But he also said that SpaceX will face &#34;more of a challenge when we get into the several million user range.&#34; The biggest limitation would be in densely populated urban areas; rural users would have better odds of getting service.\n As noted earlier, Starlink warns beta users to expect &#34;brief periods of no connectivity at all&#34;\u2014even if they don&#39;t run into thermal shutdowns.\u00a0&#34;We still have a lot of work to do to make the network reliable,&#34; SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell  said in April. &#34;We still have drops, not necessarily just because of where the satellites are in the sky.&#34; SpaceX will keep the service in beta &#34;until the network is reliable and great and something we&#39;d be proud of,&#34; Shotwell said.\n The Verge  reviewed Starlink last month and found frustrating reliability problems. &#34;Like the similarly over-hyped mmWave 5G, Starlink is remarkably delicate. Even a  single tree blocking the dish&#39;s line of sight to the horizon will degrade and interrupt your Starlink signal,&#34; The Verge wrote.\n  The service will surely become more stable by the time SpaceX moves it from beta to general availability, as Shotwell promised. Even in beta, Starlink is providing much-needed connectivity to people with no other options. If SpaceX brings reliable broadband to a few million users, that would be a success, but there may be  tens of millions of Americans without access to high-speed broadband.  Tens of millions of others have to pay whatever the cable company demands because there&#39;s no competition where they live.\n Widespread fiber-to-the-home deployment would make a bigger difference for more Internet users than Starlink. President Joe Biden pledged to lower prices and deploy &#34;future-proof&#34; broadband to all Americans, but he&#39;s already  scaled back his plan in the face of opposition from Republicans and incumbent ISPs. AT&amp;T has been  lobbying against nationwide fiber and funding for municipal networks, and AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey  expressed confidence last week that Congress will steer legislation in the direction that AT&amp;T favors.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:58:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "starlink,dishes", "title":

editor that has all the important  core features and to do them  right, with a modern user interface/experience.\n    You&#39;re totally free to try and use it without paying anything, and all the things you create with this tool are, obviously,  all  yours (even for commercial use). At any given time, you can still decide to contribute by paying any price you want for the app.\n  Universal and agnostic: compatible with all languages (not only Haxe) and game frameworks in the world\n JSON: easy to parse  file format for any game-engine out there (I promise it\u2019s actually really easy). Haxe isn\u2019t required.\n Tiled export: LDtk can export Tiled TMX files for frameworks that only support this format. Note: this feature ONLY exists as a temporary method to load a LDtk project JSON in a game framework that only supports TMX files. It is recommended to just read the LDtk JSON.\n  Auto-layers: paint your collision map and see the grass, textures and all the small details being  drawn automatically!\n Entities: fully customizable  Entity with custom properties (ex: you can have a \u201cMob\u201d entity, with a \u201chitPoints\u201d field, which is an Integer limited to [0,10] bounds).\n Enums: you can define an  enumeration (ex: an \u201cItemType\u201d enum with \u201cMoney\u201d, \u201cAmmo\u201d, \u201cGun\u201d values) and use this enum in your entity custom fields.\n External enums: enums can be imported and synced directly from Haxe source code files (HX file)!\n  Auto update: you get notified as soon as a stable update is released and it\u2019s up to you to install it when you\u2019re ready, with a  single click.\n LDtk loves Haxe: a powerful  Haxe API which gives you access to fully  typed values from your levels. It avoids mistakes like mistyping, renaming or removals: you see errors during compilation, not at runtime. For example, having  var p = new MyLdtkProject(), you can do things like  p.all_levels.MyIntroLevel.all_enemies[0].f_hitPoints.\n      The downloaded file for Windows (LDtk 0.9.3 installer.exe) apparently installed correctly under Windows 7 Pro, including a shortcut icon on the Desktop, followed by the Loading splash screen, but next was a black screen displaying just the LDtk logo top left. See screenshot. Same occurs if installing/running as Administrator.\n  2) custom fonts? I would like to change that font around the level (&#39;size\u00a0256px etc&#39;) as it looks a bit pixelated. or maybe fix it.\n   Hey Deepnight, it looks like this might be a problem for another user that posted 2 days ago. Perhaps this is a problem that occurs on Windows 7 devices?\n Hi! I just want to mention that I have this same problem (am also on Windows 7), and there isn&#39;t a ldtk.log file in the directory that you specified. I&#39;m assuming ldtk.log is a crash log file, which would explain why it isn&#39;t there, because the program doesn&#39;t crash, it just shows an empty screen with no warnings or errors.\n Thanks, I\u2019ll try to fix that for 0.9.4 :)There is an open issue here if you want to get notified of any progress done:  https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/498\n Sorry about that, I\u2019ll try to fix it in 0.9.4 update.Issue is here:  https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues/498\n    Any way you could implement a &#34;color&#34; or &#34;tint&#34; function, per tile? I have some 1-bit tile sets that I&#39;d love to work with, but I don&#39;t know any tile-based tools that allow arbitrary coloring, so it&#39;s hard to visualize and experiment.\n That\u2019s an interesting idea, but coloring can mean various things \ud83e\udd14 In this case, you meant \u201cto replace the white color by another custom color\u201d, right?\n Feel free to open a suggestion issue on GitHub, I\u2019ll have a look :)  https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk/issues\n  You can create Entities with whatever property you\u2019d need. But yes it\u2019s a level editor, not a game engine :)\n  Since it saves to JSON, you can use any JSON-to-C# converter (just google it) to create the class, then use your JSON library of choice to load the data very easily.\n Perfect level editor. I hope it gets libGDX framework with Java language\u00a0support. I think I can still use it though with the .tmx file export and through reading .json files.\n Also you don&#39;t have to but I would like it if you would advertise the game I make ;)\u00a0 It will earn us both more money but feel free to say no any time.\n  I&#39;m using this to make a game. It will be sold for money, and because this is absolutely godsend, I&#39;m going to split the profit 50/50 with you via PayPal.\n Even if I really appreciate your offer, I definitely cannot accept \ud83d\ude42 I have very strong beliefs on this specific topic, and your game is  your creation. And as such, it belongs completely to you. That\u2019s the exact reason I went for a MIT license on LDtk, because I believe creators should earn the full profits of their hard work (not a big fan of Unreal engine business model and such) \ud83d\udc4d\n LDtk is a tool with a pay-what-you-want model, but in its spirit, it\u2019s intended to be free. My best reward is it to be used by people to make cool games \ud83d\udc4c\n We just love free software!  PS. Infinity Falls Studio Even though he wont accept your money from sales of your game, if you really want to give Deepnight Games some money, you could take the 50% (or whatever you want) and buy a copy of LDtk and use the &#34;pay-what -you-want&#34; option = you can give as much money as you want.\n  Thank you :) Let me check if it\u2019s possible to make a x86 build: I\u2019ll keep you updated :)\n You can check for a new download on the LDtk page. Tell me if it works for you!\n This might sound silly but after downloading and trying LDTK out, I&#39;ve dropped everything else and started learning  Haxe + Heap. This map editor is just dope. Thank you man!\n There is a problem: Every time the download is about to finish it throws an error. What will it be? Anyway, I think it is a great tool, which serves both indie developers and large companies.\n Is it the download from itch.io website page? If so, you might try to clear your browser cache (and downloaded files) completely and try again.

Incredible, simply incredible!\n This application is an absolute godsend for any developer, pixel artist and/or level designer.

Recently, a\u00a0 perspective \u00a0in\u00a0 JAMA \u00a0was published on this topic, highlighting the increasing number of start-up companies promoting the use of CGM in nondiabetics, and included some arguments suggesting that CGMs are \u201ca waste of time and money\u201d for this population. The author states that \u201c\u2026 aside from anecdotal stories, there\u2019s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose,\u201d according to the perspective. They also argue that because glucose fluctuations are so small in nondiabetics, a CGM doesn\u2019t provide any meaningful information for them. I want to tell you why I not only disagree with these assertions, but also why this type of thinking may be dangerous to the health of hundreds of millions of Americans.   First, arguing that there\u2019s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose is putting the cart before the horse. How do you know if someone has normal glucose responses without tracking their glucose first? Using CGM on someone with \u201cnormal\u201d glucose as defined by standard measures such as fasting glucose or HbA1c can determine whether they truly do have tight glucose control and how they respond to different challenges, dietary or otherwise. Just because someone\u2019s fasting glucose or HbA1c levels are considered normal doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that they have high glucose variability, which are large oscillations in blood glucose throughout the day, including episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Fasting glucose and HbA1c levels don\u2019t necessarily tell us if people are experiencing normal glucose responses. The only way to know if they are is to track their blood glucose. Is it safe to assume normal fasting glucose (i.e., less than 100 mg/dL) and normal HbA1c (i.e., less than 5.7%) tightly map to low variability and spikes in glucose?\u00a0   In our practice the answer is, how shall I say it, not even close. Over the past three years we have been tracking these metrics closely and found that at least one-third of the time HbA1c is an inaccurate predictor of average blood glucose relative to true average measured by CGM (and this discordance occurs in both directions, meaning sometimes HbA1c overestimates and sometimes it underestimates). Furthermore, we\u2019ve seen how irrelevant morning fasting glucose can be as a predictor of in-depth glucose kinetics, outside of the extremes seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. In other words, in non-diabetics, a fasting morning blood glucose level of 90 vs 95 vs 100 vs 105 mg/dL can have much more to do with the previous night\u2019s dinner, the quality of sleep that evening, or even the speed and suddenness with which they woke up that morning (and the concomitant cortisol surge) than their true health.\u00a0   In 2018, a\u00a0 study \u00a0in nearly 60 participants found many individuals considered nondiabetic by standard measures showed high glucose variability determined by CGM. Severe glucose variability was present in one-quarter of normoglycemic individuals, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic ranges \u2014 defined as values greater than 140 mg/dL \u2014 up to 15% of the duration of CGM recordings, suggesting glucose dysregulation is more prevalent than we might think.   But the recent\u00a0 JAMA \u00a0perspective pointed to a 2019\u00a0 study \u00a0that was attempting to create reference ranges for glycemic profiles in more than 150 healthy nondiabetics that found they spent 96% of the time between 70 and 140 mg/dL based on about one week of CGM data, on average. This study was used to support the argument that there is in fact tight glucose control in these individuals, confirming that \u201cnormal is normal is normal,\u201d as one of the study\u2019s coauthors put it.\u00a0   A closer look at the findings, however, suggests otherwise. Median time spent with glucose levels above 140 mg/dL was 30 minutes a day and median time spent with glucose levels below 70 mg/dL was 15 minutes a day. Almost one-third of the participants had at least one hypoglycemic event, defined as a glucose level below 54 mg/dL, and almost half had at least one hyperglycemic event, defined as a glucose level above 180 mg/dL.   Spending 30 minutes a day with glucose levels above 140 mg/dL may be the benchmark in this population, but that does not mean it\u2019s optimal. The target I want my patients to hit in terms of the number of total glucose excursions above 140 mg/dL per week is zero. We never want to see glucose above 140 mg/dL. While the study didn\u2019t report the number of weekly excursions, it\u2019s probably safe to assume, given the averages, that I believe there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement in the vast majority of the participants. One of the important lessons I\u2019ve learned from consuming a lot of the scientific literature is that being skeptical of the interpretation of the results is the default position. (In that vein, my hope is that you are now skeptical of my interpretation at this point.)   As I\u00a0 recently discussed in an AMA on the topic, higher glucose variability and higher (and more) peak glucose levels are each independently associated with accelerated onset of disease and death, even in nondiabetics. Prospective studies show that higher glucose variability in nondiabetics is associated with an increased risk of\u00a0 cardiovascular disease ,\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s disease ,\u00a0 frailty ,\u00a0 cardiovascular death ,\u00a0 cancer death , and\u00a0 death from any cause \u00a0compared to lower glucose variability.\u00a0 Other \u00a0 prospective \u00a0 studies \u00a0 show \u00a0 similar \u00a0 trends \u00a0for higher compared to lower peak glucose levels and\u00a0 several \u00a0 human \u00a0 experiments \u00a0 demonstrate \u00a0that high glucose peaks induce endothelial dysfunction in healthy nondiabetic individuals, and higher postprandial glucose levels are also associated with\u00a0 higher carotid intima-media thickness , suggesting higher glucose peaks may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, even in those with normal glucose tolerance. There is also remarkably robust data from the Interventions Testing Program, the gold standard of testing compounds for life extension in mice, demonstrating that two different drugs with completely different mechanisms of action (acarbose and canagliflozin) which suppress postprandial glucose peaks and both extended median and 90th percentile lifespan independent of body weight and average glucose levels. Granted, what\u2019s true in mice might not translate to humans and the aforementioned prospective studies are of the observational epidemiological nature where skepticism of the results and the interpretation are required. In my partial defense, there\u2019s a good deal of skepticism and scrutiny on my part, and those of the analysts that work with me, that factor into determining whether the data is worth considering or not. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a quote out there attributed to Einstein that says confirmation bias is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. When it comes to observational epidemiology, there\u2019s always a selective interpretation of the evidence.   Glucose control lives on a spectrum, but it conventionally gets lumped into three distinct categories: normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes. For example, whether your HbA1c is 4.6% or 5.6%, both are considered \u201cnormal\u201d because they both fall under the diagnostic threshold of 5.7%. Once it hits 5.7%, so long as it does not exceed 6.4%, now you\u2019ve got impaired glucose tolerance, also referred to as prediabetes. Once you\u2019ve eclipsed the latter, whether your HbA1c is 6.5% or 12.5% (or even higher), you\u2019re categorized as having type 2 diabetes. In most cases of type 2 diabetes, an individual traverses from one bucket to the next as their HbA1c slowly climbs from normal to impaired to outright diabetic. This doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but too often it\u2019s only confronted when the diabetes or prediabetes threshold is reached at a snapshot in time. Progressing from an HbA1c of 4.6% to 5.6% represents estimated average glucose levels climbing from 85 to 114 mg/dL. This should be setting off alarm bells along the way, but I worry that those bells aren\u2019t ringing because it\u2019s not deemed necessary to keep a close eye on blood glucose in someone with normal glucose tolerance. I have a friend who flies helicopters. The other day she was telling me that there is a warning system in place for when minuscule fragments of metal are in the hydraulic fluid. Though they pose no immediate danger, if left in place long enough, they will erode gears and potentially lead to a catastrophic outcome. So you overhaul the hydraulics as soon as you get the warning, not when the gears start grinding. Viewing glucose regulation as abrupt categories like this rather than a spectrum is probably one of the biggest reasons why\u00a0 more than 120 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes .\u00a0   In the vast majority of cases, today\u2019s normal individual is tomorrow\u2019s diabetic patient if something isn\u2019t done to detect and prevent this slide. Not only that, but prospective studies also demonstrate a continuous increase in the associated risk for\u00a0 cardiovascular disease ,\u00a0 cardiovascular death , and\u00a0 deaths from all causes \u00a0throughout a broad range of HbA1c values beginning at 5.0%. Similar trends are observed for elevated HbA1c values and higher rates of\u00a0 frailty ,\u00a0 cognitive decline and dementia ,\u00a0 COVID-19 hospitalizations and death , and\u00a0 cancer mortality , suggesting that lowering your average glucose levels even when they might be deemed normal by traditional cutoff points can make a difference.   To recap my position and interpretation of the data available (more of which you can find in\u00a0 the AMA 24 show notes), lower is better than higher when it comes to average glucose, glucose variability, and glucose peaks, even in nondiabetics. In other words, there\u2019s a lot of evidence suggesting that people with glucose in the normal range can benefit from lowering their numbers.   Let me give you an anecdote, among several I could share, to demonstrate why I find CGM useful in nondiabetics. I have a patient who came to me with normal glucose tolerance by standard metrics. He began CGM and after about two weeks it revealed an average glucose of 104 mg/dL over that time. The standard deviation in his glucose readings, which is a metric of glucose variability, was 17 mg/dL. He averaged more than five events per week in which his glucose levels exceeded 140 mg/dL. All three of these metrics are considered normal by conventional standards, but does that mean there\u2019s no room for improvement? I like to see my patients with a mean glucose below 100 mg/dL, a glucose variability below 15 mg/dL, and, as noted above, no excursions of glucose above 140 mg/dL. After about a four-week intervention that included exercise changes and nutritional modifications his average glucose fell to 84 mg/dL, his glucose variability to 13 mg/dL, and he had zero events exceeding 140 mg/dL. If he can maintain this way of living in the long-run, it\u2019s likely to translate into an improvement in healthspan and reduce his risk of glucose impairment.\u00a0   Going back to the first argument from the perspective, it may be true that aside from anecdotal accounts, there\u2019s little evidence that people with normal glucose responses benefit from tracking their blood glucose, but don\u2019t confuse an absence of evidence with evidence of absence. I can\u2019t point you to a long-term randomized-controlled clinical trial rejecting the hypothesis that people with normal glucose responses don\u2019t benefit from tracking their blood glucose because those trials don\u2019t exist (yet, hopefully), but don\u2019t confuse an absence of evidence with evidence of absence. There are examples where the randomized-controlled clinical trial data isn\u2019t there, but we still have a strong reason to believe it\u2019s true. While it\u2019s not the same level of confidence I have in parachutes improving survival when jumping out of an airplane at 10,000 feet or smoking two packs of Marlboros a day increasing the risk of lung cancer, I do believe that relatively healthy people who track their glucose responses will fare better in the long run than those who don\u2019t.\u00a0   An important question related to these kinds of trials, and one that I can\u2019t explore without at least doubling the length of this article is: what kinds of behavioral changes move the needle and keep it there in the long run? In other words, the reason why I have confidence that tracking glucose responses if beneficial is because I have confidence that we can optimize them (and even more confidence that we can at least stave off their decline). If we don\u2019t have any effective interventions, saying we don\u2019t get any benefit from CGMs is like a group of carpenters saying they don\u2019t get any benefit from tape measures. If that\u2019s the case, maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider our approach to the problem. Overall, there are some interesting points from the perspective, some of which I haven\u2019t addressed here, but I disagree with the notion that the use of CGM is \u201ca waste of time and money that diverts consumers\u2019 attention from useful interventions,\u201d or that it \u201cit\u2019s just like a supplement\u2014we don\u2019t know whether it works or not,\u201d as some experts think.\u00a0   For many people (certainly for me and most of our patients), when you start wearing CGM, it\u2019s 90% \u201cinsight\u201d and 10% behavioral. After a few months, the situation flips. You now have a good idea of what triggers the spikes (i.e., less insight), but it becomes a remarkable\u2014in fact, it\u2019s hands-down the best I\u2019ve seen yet\u2014accountability tool (i.e., more behavioral). It\u2019s simultaneously a behavioral and analytical tool that can track and uncover strategies and tactics which can actually save an enormous amount of time and money by preventing bad outcomes in the future. Instead of (or in addition to) questioning groundbreaking technology like CGM, we should do more questioning of ourselves and how we use it.\n  Sign up to receive the 5 tactics in my Longevity Toolkit, followed by non-lame, weekly emails on the latest strategies and tactics for increasing your lifespan, healthspan, and well-being (plus new podcast announcements).\n      Disclaimer: This blog is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute the practice of medicine, nursing or other professional health care services, including the giving of medical advice, and no doctor/patient relationship is formed.

A guide to the fence sitters pondering whether to use Julia for high performance computing.\n  It may seem hard to believe that a dynamic language can be fast, but Julia is really high performance in a way I think people have a hard time wrapping their heads around.\n I explain this in detail in my ACCU 2021 conference talk:  A Tour of Julia \u2014 Erik Engheim\n But that is about 1.5 hours, so here is the quick rundown. I use a nonsense function in Julia just to demonstrate how highly dynamic code can be optimize in Julia.\n function foo(xs...)  ys = map(xs)  do x  T = typeof(x)  k = convert(T, 2)  c = convert(T, 3)  k*x + c*x   end  sum(ys)  end\n It is not that important to understand exactly what it does. What I want to highlight in this code is a number of facts:\n No explict type information is written anywhere. A lot of people thing Julia performance comes from type annotations. Not true.\n Optimization ought to be hard given that it has variable number of arguments  xs... . How will a compiler know how to optimize, when the number of args is only known at runtime?\n The code is extremely dynamic. The type of every element  x in array  xsis looked up with  typeof(x). Something you cannot in principle know at compile time. Then integer constants 2 and 3 are converted to whatever type  x is.\n The  map function is passed a kernel or anonymous function which is this code block:\n do x  T = typeof(x)  k = convert(T, 2)  c = convert(T, 3)  k*x + c*x  end\n This tends to be hard to optimize. People using Python should be accustomed to this. If you pass some custom Python code kernel into a module with C++ code, it will be hard to optimize. Likewise if you pass a function pointer to another C function, the compiler cannot optimize that as it cannot know in advance what function will get passed as argument.\n With this in mind. Try to imagine in the ballpark of how much machine code would get generated to run the following expression at the Julia command line:\n  Below you can see the machine code this turns into. Now you may not know x86 assembly, so let me give a little walk through. The  addq instructions are simple additions, and  leaq, is additions and shift (multiply with numbers which are multiples of 2), and  retq returns the result.\n  In other words highly dynamic and complex code got turned into basically nothing by the Julia JIT compiler. Code written as generic and dynamic as this would be impossible to turn into this efficient machine code even in C or Fortran. And the beauty is how easy it is to look at what machine code a method call turns into. Here is how I found out at the Julia command line:\n  You can simply put the macro  @code_native in front of any expression you want to see what machine code Julia generates for.\n  At the SC19, the International Conference for Supercomputing in 2019, one of the Julia creators Alan Edelman recounts how a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) rewrote part of their Fortran climate model into Julia. They determined ahead of time that they would  tolerate a 3x slowdown of their code. That was an acceptable tradeoff to get access to a high-level language with higher productivity in their view. Instead they got a 3x speed boost by going over to Julia.\n For really demanding tasks we run them on supercomputers. There are only three langauges which have achieved petaflops performance in the world until Julia came along: C, C++ and Fortran.\n Julia is the forth language in the world which has been run on supercomputers to achieve petaflops performance. That is why it is being used e.g. for the next generation climate models, by e.g. CliMA as well as for astronomy projects like Celeste.\n ClimateMachine.jl  \u2014 CliMA Julia source code on GitHub. You can see yourself how next generation climate models are built using Julia instead of Fortran. Built by Caltech, MITa and NASA JPL scientists.\n Celeste.jl \u2014 Finds and characterizes stars and galaxies in astronomical images, by processing 178 terabytes of data on 650 000 cores running at 1.54 petaflops.\n Currently we are seeing development of Julia version of time honored libraries such as BLAS, which has has been optimized on Fortran for decades. Yet early tests of Julia implementations are showing that they are outperforming Fortran. That is quite a feat given that Fortran is a low level programming language for numerical code.\n  This is however not the key reason why scientists are increasingly switching to Julia for high performance. A key challenge today is heterogenous computing. We are increasingly squeezing performance by using multiple cores, GPUs, SIMD instructions, multiple-computers, specialized vector processing units etc. This creates a lot of complexity. How do you quickly develop, test and iterate on all this kind of hardware. Statically typed compiled languages like C/C++ and Fortran become major bottlenecks.\n Here is an example of how easy this is to do in Julia. Say you call a machine learning training function (we are using the  Flux library in this example):\n  In Julia you can simply turn the inputs into data stored in GPU memory using the  gpu function from the  CUDA.jl package. As you can see the exact same  train! function gets called with the same arguments wrapped.\n  Here is a very important thing to realize about this.  train! has  not been written for the GPU. It  doesn\u2019t know it is being passed data living in GPU memory. There is no  if-else statement inside checking if the code should be run on a GPU or CPU. Instead Julia utilizes its killer feature multiple-dispatch. This allows code to be specialized for different types. The Julia JIT will simply generate GPU code because all interactions between mathematical operators inside  train! involves a GPU type. This is very powerful. It allows you to develop code live in an interactive fashion on the CPU. You can step through the code and test it. When you are happy it works, minimal change is requried to get the same code to run on a GPU.\n  Before you jump all exited on the Julia train and convert your Python or C++ code in a rush to Julia, there are some things to know. Julia is not magic. Code you have finely tuned for Python or C++ would not necessarily run fast on Julia with a naive port. You have to actually learn Julia properly and understand its performance model.\n   In other languages people will optimize in ways which does not give high performance in Julia. E.g. C/C++ coders may often try to avoid function calls especially virtual calls. Thus in many other language people often go for larger functions to avoid overhead. In Python function call overhead is so high that one tries to vectorize code by pushing stuff into numpy and avoid things like for-loops. Julia is almost the opposite. To get max performance in Julia, you typically want to do the following:\n Prefer dynamic dispatch over if-statements. You should not have code checking explicitly for concrete types in Julia.\n Julia also has some unique hangups you may not be accustomed to. In Julia  type-stability is a alpha-omega. Code should be written in a way such that the type of a value within a function does not vary. You should attempt to keep the type of values within a function stable.\n  I see plenty of times that people complain about not seeing speed improvements after porting to Julia. Usually they did a naive port and did not actually learn how you optimize Julia code. The other classic mistake is to forget that the Python code they had before may actually have been mostly C/C++ code. If a library written in C/C++ code does all the heavy lifting and it has been optimized over a decade, then a much younger Julia library may not be faster. Julia is a young language and not every library has been optimized to its fullest potential.\n But a classic discussion in the Julia community is somebody posting an example of something running slower in Julia. Within short time Julia experts have profiled it, found the bottleneck and boom you got higher performance code than the competition. That is the beauty of Julia. It is \u201cturtles all the way down,\u201d meaning Julia is Julia code all the way down. You find a problem, you can usually fix it yourself. Unless you are a C/C++ wizard normal Python developers cannot fix or optimize big libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow. In Julia its users tend to contribute more to the libraries they use themselves.\n Thus it is important to view Julia performance as a strong potential rather than something guaranteed. Julia gives you the language features and a JIT compiler which makes it possible for you to optimize Julia code and get it as fast or faster than C/C++ or Fortran. With a language like Python you hit the ceiling of what is possible to do much sooner.\n  Okay, I hope this will not be famous last words, but let me try to articulate what I mean. I am an old school C/C++ developer. I cannot say I ever found it easy to reason about C/C++ code. The only advantage I could see over Julia is that I tended to have a better handle on when memory got allocated and freed as well as its layout.\n However Julia is in my opinion easier to reason about and deal with. You can write tiny functions and quickly check what code they turn into. You can profile individual functions in a variety of ways and the JIT can warn you about coding choices which will hurt performance. This ability to focus on one small function at a time makes it easier to understand performance and optimization in my view. With C++ you would always deal with whole files. Without an interactive environment it was hard to make quick changes and observe performance changes. In Julia I can make a small change to a function in my code editor and immediately benchmark just that one function in the REPL.\n In C/C++ if you find out that your performance sucks because of bad use of CPU cache, you may want to change memory layout by e.g. transforming an array of structs into a struct of arrays. In C/C++ this would require major code rewrite. In Julia you can just pass your data type as a type parameter to the  StructArray parameterized type. All existing code will work the same.\n In fact this can even be combined with data on the GPU. Julia libraries mix and match unlike in any other programming language.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:14:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

The 2021 report shows the effects of COVID-19 on AI development from multiple perspectives. The Technical Performance chapter discusses how an AI startup used machine-learning-based techniques to accelerate COVID-related drug discovery during the pandemic, and our Economy chapter suggests that AI hiring and private investment were not significantly adversely influenced by the pandemic, as both grew during 2020.\n The United Nations has called upon governments to develop national strategies for sustainable development, incorporating policy measures to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. While AI technologies may support breakthroughs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, they may also have unanticipated consequences that will exacerbate inequalities and negatively impact individuals, societies, economies and the environment. The Resource Guide on Artificial Intelligence Strategies is a UN publication laying out existing resources on artificial intelligence ethics, policies and strategies on national, regional and international level [2].\n To help humanity solve fundamental problems of cooperation, scientists need to reconceive artificial intelligence as deeply social [3]. The state of AI applications reflects that of the research field. It has long been steeped in a kind of methodological individualism. As is evident from introductory textbooks, the canonical AI problem is that of a solitary machine confronting a non-social environment. AI needs social understanding and cooperative intelligence to integrate well into society.\n Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application [4]. Thus, this study\u2019s key contribution is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce, agriculture, and many more.\n For the purpose of entrusting all sentient beings with powerful AI tools to learn, deploy and scale AI in order to enhance their prosperity, to settle planetary-scale problems and to inspire those who, with AI, will shape the 21st Century, Montreal.ai introduces this VIP AI 101 CheatSheet for All [5]. Montreal.ai is preparing a global network of education centers to pioneer an impactful understanding of AI and to foster a vector for safe humanitarian Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\n Starting from such general references,\u00a0this booklet identifies\u00a0ten relevant areas from very\u00a0recent contributions put forward at academic level in the form\u00a0journal articles, conference proceedings and students\u00a0theses. Ten freely accessible\u00a0internet\u00a0references have been\u00a0selected for each area and direct links are provided\u00a0at the end of each chapter for own consultation. Our selected references do not intend to mirror ranking indexes nor establish novel classifications.\u00a0On the contrary,\u00a0they are meant to represent peer-reviewed,\u00a0diverse and\u00a0scientifically-sound case studies for vertical dissemination aimed at non-specialist readers. They\u00a0will\u00a0also\u00a0be able to scoop\u00a0even more references through the bibliography\u00a0that is reported at the end of\u00a0each selected reference.\n Without further ado, these are the \u201c Ten Problems\u00a0for Artificial Intelligence\u00a0in the 2020s\u201d\u00a0that we are going to introduce\u00a0in this booklet:\n  Each problem has its own dedicated chapter made of an introductory section, a short presentation of the ten selected references and a conclusions section.\n The final chapter of this booklet will report the conclusions from each chapter again in order to provide a complete executive summary.\n  [1] D.

Over time I have built a workflowthat mitigates the cost of setting up benchmarks and allows me to analyzeperformance more effectively. This blog post covers my workflow as of 2021.\n Performance investigations often follow these steps: Go to Step 3 until the desired benchmark results are reached, keeping those optimizations that helped.\n This is a long process that is costly to pause/resume or replicate again in the future. Setting up hardware and software manually is both time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore we don&#39;t want to do it more than once. There is a risk that replicating the benchmark on another machine will fail to produce identical results due to differences in environments.\n The consequence of high-overhead processes is that we minimize their use since we cannot afford to run through the process as often as we&#39;d like. This means we cannot answer all the performance questions we&#39;d like to and therefore our understanding is limited. We cannot discover all the truths that would enable us to make performance improvements.\n    Set up hardware and software once only and be able to return to that state again in the future at the press of a button.\n    Store benchmark results so that each run is available for further analysis in the future.\n  Go to Step 2 to modify the environment (e.g. apply proof-of-concept patches to software) and repeat.\n Since the performance investigation is captured in a git branch it&#39;s easy to switch to another investigation without losing history.\n This is actually what I do! Git provides the storage and time machine functionality for easily pausing/resuming or replicating performance investigations.\n  Ansible provides the automation system necessary to put hardware and software into the desired state for benchmarking. Ansible&#39;s killer feature is the large ecosystem of modules for handling tasks like installing packages, configuring virtual machines and containers, etc. I find Ansible more productive than Python or shell scripting thanks to Ansible&#39;s modules collection.\n I&#39;ve begun collecting Ansible tasks for Linux KVM development in  virt-tasks. If you&#39;re wondering what the configuration for running a benchmark looks like, here is an Ansible playbook that builds QEMU and a guest kernel, creates a Fedora 34 virtual machine, runs the fio disk I/O benchmark, and collects the results:\n --- -  hosts : hosts  tasks :  -  include_tasks : tasks/build-qemu.yml  vars :  -  repo :  https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git  -  version : v6.0.0  -  name : create disk image  include_tasks : tasks/virt-builder-create-image.yml  vars :  -  os_version : fedora-34  -  size : 32G  -  output : /var/lib/libvirt/images/test.img  -  format : raw  -  name : build guest kernel  include_tasks : tasks/build-kernel.yml  vars :  -  repo :  https://gitlab.com/stefanha/linux.git  -  version : cpuidle-haltpoll-virtqueue  -  config_src_path : files/.config  -  name : stop vm  virt :  name : test  state : shutdown  ignore_errors : yes  -  name : start vm  include_tasks : tasks/start-vm.yml  vars :  -  xml :  &#34; {{ lookup(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;files/test.xml&#39;) }} &#34;  -  host : 192.168.122.192 -  hosts : vms  tasks :  -  name : install fio and rsync  dnf :  state : present  name :  - fio  - rsync  -  name : run fio  script : files/fio.sh  -  name : fetch fio output files  synchronize :  src : fio-output/  dest : notebook/fio-output/poll_source-off  mode : pull  -  name : run fio  script : files/fio.sh --enable  -  name : fetch fio output files  synchronize :  src : fio-output/  dest : notebook/fio-output/poll_source-on  mode : pull -  hosts : hosts  tasks :  -  name : stop vm  virt :  name : test  state : shutdown\n An important point is that the Ansible playbook sets up the full environment, runs all benchmarks, and collects the results. Unlike a playbook that runs a single benchmark this one runs the full suite so that the playbook captures the entire environment that produced the results. This distinction is important when tweaking the benchmark configuration or trying out proof-of-concept optimizations. Each git commit needs to encompass the full environment so that the performance investigation is reproducible and can be resumed in the future.\n  I recently started using  JupyterLab notebooks for data analysis. It provides a convenient environment for graphing results and organizing them in documents.\n  Thanks to the official Jupyter container images you can get a full Python data analysis environment running with just one command:\n  So far I have only scratched the surface of JupyterLab. It works well for visualizing data although the way I currently use it is not much different from writing a Python matplotlib script and running it from the command-line. In time I&#39;ll get a better appreciation for its strengths and weaknesses.\n  A git-based workflow that automates benchmark setup and stores the results goes a long way towards mitigating the high overhead of performance investigations. If I&#39;m interrupted or need to switch to a different machine it&#39;s easy to resume the investigation. Having the results and details of the environment stored together makes it possible to revisit benchmark runs in the future to reproduce or tweak them. The combination of git, Ansible, and Jupyter achieves this workflow quite well, but if you&#39;re familiar with other tools I&#39;d love to hear!", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:14:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u57fa\u51c6,benchmarking", "title": "\u6211\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b ", "title_en": "My performance benchmarking workflow", "transed": 1, "url": "http://blog.vmsplice.net/2021/06/my-performance-benchmarking-workflow.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u57fa\u51c6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ea3e2a9f3d310a6ae95b45d83a460c92.jpeg", "infoid": 1067045, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u53bb\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u5df7\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8f66\u8f86\u5e74\u9f84\u5347\u81f312.1\u5c81\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5d07\u9ad8\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fc3\u9500\u4e1a\u4e3b\u66f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6301\u6709\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u3002\n  \u6839\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u53f8IHS Markit\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6839\u636e\u200b\u200b\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u572812\u5e74\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u666e\u901a\u8f66\u5e74\u4e0a\u6da8\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u768415\u5e74\u91cc\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u8f66\u8f86\u65f6\u4ee3\u7a33\u6b65\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u65b0\u8f66\u9500\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u51a0\u5fc3\u75c5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u3002\n  \u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5728\u5176\u5bff\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u65b0\u8f66\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u652f\u4ed8\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u6258\u5fb7\u00b7\u574e\u666e\uff08IHS\u552e\u540e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u526f\u4e3b\u4efb\uff09\u6258\u5fb7\u574e\u666e\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n  \u867d\u713620\u5e74\u524d\uff0c\u4e00\u8f86\u6c7d\u8f66\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u4e00\u6b21\u6216\u4e24\u6b21\uff0c\u6301\u7eed100,000\u82f1\u91cc\uff0c\u4f46\u4eca\u5929\u662f\u4e00\u8f86\u6c7d\u8f66\u66f4\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u662f\u62e5\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u4e1a\u4e3b\u5e76\u6301\u7eed200,000\u82f1\u91cc\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\n  \u201c\u8fd9\u5df2\u7ecf\u5ef6\u957f\u4e86\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u66f4\u591a\u4e70\u65b9\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u8fde\u9501\u5e97\u4e0a\u4e0b\uff0c\u201dCamau\u5148\u751f\u3002 \u201c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e2a\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6216\u7b2c\u4e09\u6216\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2a\u8001\u677f\uff0c\u9aa8\u9abc\u4e0a\u8fd8\u6709\u8089\u3002\u201d\n  \u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\uff08\u5982\u679c\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u7387\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002 ", "note_en": "The average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways rose to a record 12.1 years last year, as lofty prices and improved quality prompt owners to hold on to their cars longer.\n  It was the first time the average vehicle age rose above 12 years, according to data released Monday by research firm IHS Markit. While the average vehicle age has risen steadily over the last 15 years, the trend accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic partly because of  a drop in new-car sales, IHS said.\n  The finding reflects the stronger value of vehicles throughout their life cycles, from higher new-vehicle prices Americans have been paying for years to  steeper prices on the used-car lot, said Todd Campau, associate director of aftermarket solutions at IHS. Improved vehicle quality also is a factor, he said.\n  Whereas 20 years ago a car might have changed hands once or twice and lasted 100,000 miles, it is more common today for a car to have multiple owners and last for 200,000 miles or more, he said.\n  \u201cThat has extended the life cycle of the vehicle and created value for more buyers up and down the chain,\u201d Mr. Campau. \u201cFor that second or third or fourth owner, there\u2019s still meat on the bone.\u201d\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

", "note_en": "Practical Common Lisp contains introductory material as well aspractical examples, such as a unit testing framework, web server, spamfilter and ID3 tag parser.\n  ANSI Common Lisp is a book for Lisp beginners. It has a niceexample of writing a simple ray tracer in Common Lisp, and another (ratherdated) example of using macros to generate HTML.\n ANSI Common Lisp combines an introduction to Lisp programming, and aconvenient, up-to-date reference manual for ANSI Common Lisp. Beginnerswill find that its careful explanations and interesting examples make Lispprogramming easy to learn. Professional programmers will appreciate itsthorough, practical approach.\n  On Lisp is \u201ca comprehensive studyof advanced Lisp techniques, with bottom-up programming as the unifyingtheme\u201d.\n The book also covers important subjects related to bottom-up programming,including functional programming, rapid prototyping, interactivedevelopment, and embedded languages. The final chapter takes a deeper lookat object-oriented programming than previous Lisp books, showing thestep-by-step construction of a working model of the Common Lisp ObjectSystem (CLOS).\n  With his brilliantly quirky comics and out-of-this-world games, longtimeLisper Conrad Barski teaches you the mysteries of Common Lisp. You\u2019ll startwith the basics, like list manipulation, I/O, and recursion, then move onto more complex topics like macros, higher order programming, anddomain-specific languages. Then, when your brain overheats, you can kickback with an action-packed comic book interlude!\n You can get an idea of the book\u2019s style in this tutorial by the same author:  Casting SPELs in Lisp\n  This book is about macros, that is programs that write programs. Macros arewhat make lisp the greatest programming language in the world. When usedproperly, macros enable amazing feats of abstraction, programmerproductivity, and code efficiency and security that are unheard ofelsewhere. Macros let you do things you simply cannot do in otherlanguages.\n If you are looking for a dry coding manual that re-hashes common-sensetechniques in whatever langue du jour, this book is not for you. This bookis about pushing the boundaries of what we know about programming. Whilethis book teaches useful macro skills that can help solve your programmingproblems today and now, it has also been designed to be entertaining andinspiring. If you have ever wondered what lisp or even programming itselfis really about, this is the book you have been looking for.\n  Professional Automated Trading: Theory and Practice uses CommonLisp to describe the implementation of automated trading systems.\n Reflecting author Eugene Durenard\u2019s extensive experience in this field,Professional Automated Trading offers valuable insights you won\u2019t findanywhere else. It reveals how a series of concepts and techniques comingfrom current research in artificial life and modern control theory can beapplied to the design of effective trading systems that outperform themajority of published trading systems. It also skillfully provides you withessential information on the practical coding and implementation of ascalable systematic trading architecture.\n    Common Lisp Recipes is a bookevery Common Lisper should keep within arm\u2019s reach.\n  Common Lisp Recipes is a collection of solutions to problemsand answers to questions you are likely to encounter when writingreal-world applications in Common Lisp. Written by an author whohas used Common Lisp in many successful commercial projects overmore than a decade, this book covers areas as diverse as webprogramming, databases, graphical user interfaces, integrationwith other programming languages, multi-threading, and mobiledevices as well as debugging techniques and optimization, to namejust a few. It is also the first Common Lisp book to tackle suchadvanced topics as environment access, logical pathnames, Graystreams, delivery of executables, pretty printing, setfexpansions, or changing the syntax of Common Lisp.\n Common Lisp Recipes is written in a style that mixes hands-on,no frills pragmatism with precise information and prudentmentorship.\n  If you are unsure how to create executables, fighting with library versionconflicts, or struggling with reproducible builds then this book can saveyou hours.\n The text lays out a framework that solves these issues.

Its success has, of course,\rendlessly tempted people to improve upon it. Thus, C is probably the patriarch of the\rlongest list of languages. Notable among these are C++, the D programming language,\rand most recently, Go. There are endless discussion threads on how to fix C, going\rback to the 80\u2019s.\n  So this is well trod ground. What could possibly be added to this soup? I posit\rthat most such discussions center around detail. More interesting is what is\rthe largest fundamental mistake. We should take into account the context of the times\rthat spawned C, and the problems it was trying to solve and the environment\rin which it was intended to be used. Keep in mind it was developed for a 16\rbit machine, with extremely limited resources available.\rI\u2019d like to dismiss things like it doesn\u2019t\rdo garbage collection, functional programming, dynamic typing, or OOP. Those aren\u2019t problems C\rattempted to address, so the lack of them are not mistakes.\n  What mistake has caused more grief, more bugs, more workarounds, more endless hours\rconsumed, etc., than any other? Many people would say\r null pointers.\rI don\u2019t agree.\n    I don\u2019t mean them using the same syntax, or the implicit conversion of\rarrays to pointers. I mean the inability to pass an array to a function\ras an array, even if it is declared to be an array. C will silently convert\rthe array to be a pointer, and will rewrite the function declaration\rso it is semantically a pointer:\n        This seemingly innocuous convenience feature is the root of endless evil.\rIt means that once arrays leave the scope in which they are defined,\rthey become pointers, and lose the information which gives the extent\rof the array \u2014 the array dimension. What are the consequences of losing\rthis information?\n  An alternative must be used. For strings, it\u2019s the whole reason for the 0 terminator.\rFor\rother arrays, it is inferred programmatically from the context. Naturally,\revery situation is different, and so an endless array (!) of bugs ensues.\n    The galaxy of C string functions, from the unsafe strcpy() to sprintf() onwards,\ris a direct result. There are various attempts at fixing this, such as the\r Safe C Library.\rThen there are all the buffer overflows, because functions\rhanded a pointer have no\ridea what the limits are, and no array bounds checking is possible.\n  This problem was inherited in toto by C++, which consequently spawned 10+ years\rof attempts to create a usable string class. Even the eventual  std::string result\ris compromised by its need to be compatible with C 0-terminated strings.\rC++ addressed the more general array problem by inventing  std::vector , and\rmany programming guidelines eschew using  T[] style arrays. But the legacy of\rC arrays continues in C++ with the\r unsafe iterator design.\n  The C99 attempted to fix this problem, but the fatal error it made was still\rnot combining the array dimension with the array pointer into one type.\n  But all isn\u2019t lost. C can still be fixed. All it needs is a little new syntax:\n    meaning an array is passed as a so-called \u201cfat pointer\u201d, i.e. a pair consisting of a\rpointer to the start of the array, and a  size_t of the array dimension.\rOf course, this won\u2019t fix any existing code, but it will enable new code to be written\rcorrectly and robustly. Over time, the syntax:\n    can be deprecated by convention and by compilers. Even better, transitioning to the\rnew way can be done by making the declarations binary compatible with older code:\n  #if NEWC\r  extern  void foo( char a[..]);\r#elif C99\r  extern  void foo(size_t dim,  char a[dim]);\r#else\r  extern  void foo(size_t dim,  char *a);\r#endif\n  This change isn\u2019t going to transform C into a modern language with all the shiny\rbells and whistles. It\u2019ll still be C, in spirit as well as practice. It will\rjust relieve C programmers of dealing with one particular constant, pernicious source of\rbugs.\n    The relevant text from K+R\u2019s The C Programming Language 5.3 is\r\u201cWhen an array name is passed to a function, what is passed is the\rlocation of the beginning of the array. Within the called function,\rthis argument is a variable, just like any other variable, and so an\rarray name argument is truly a pointer, that is, a variable containing\ran address.\u201d\n  The relevant text from the C 99 Standard 6.7.5.3.7 is\r\u201cA declaration of a parameter as \u2018array of type\u2019\r\rshall be adjusted to \u2018qualified pointer to type\u2019\r\u201d\n  From Stroupstrup\u2019s The C++ Programming Language first edition 7.1\r\u201cand as usual, array names are converted to pointers.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 23:12:55", "source_domain":

 ...... ", "note_en": "Maine officials and a California company hired to upgrade the state\u2019s ancient human resources management software are locked in  a multimillion-dollar contract dispute after a months-long standoff over how to complete the long-delayed project. But while the state has claimed the company, Workday, has failed to deliver a workable system, an investigation by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram reveals that a series of problems on the state\u2019s side are largely to blame for the project\u2019s collapse.\n  Inexperienced and poorly qualified people were running the complex project for the state at multiple levels, according to state contractors. Payroll data imported from the old system was faulty. A state manager was accused of harassing both state and Workday personnel. The work environment grew so toxic that project workers would go outside to cry or sit in silence inside their cars, their colleagues said.\n  And when the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services brought in a new project manager to rescue the distressed project, it hired the DAFS commissioner\u2019s husband, a move that was legal under the state nepotism laws but one that government ethics experts say should have been avoided.\n This dysfunctional picture of the state of Maine\u2019s stalled project to introduce a new human resources management software system emerged from an examination by the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram into how things went awry, leaving the state\u2019s 12,000 employees relying on an antiquated software system the commissioner herself has described as \u201cbeing held together with duct tape and paper clips.\u201d\n The effort, which has sought to replace a nearly 40-year-old system programmed in an obsolete language only one state employee knows how to use, has spanned two administrations and lead vendors, has missed its deadlines three times, and has resulted in legislative oversight hearings, calls for an investigation by the state\u2019s watchdog agency, and a multimillion-dollar dispute between Workday and the state that\u2019s likely to go to court.\n In the process, the state has spent $34.7 million\u00a0over five years with nothing to show for it, just a partially functional system that hasn\u2019t yet been put online. Kirsten Figueroa, the DAFS commissioner, has blamed Workday for the project\u2019s failure, saying it had \u201cconsistently operated in bad faith and has knowingly misled state officials\u201d in a Feb. 25 letter to the company. Estimated costs to deliver a working system are now expected to total $55 million.\n State officials declined to answer the Press Herald\u2019s questions about the project, citing the potential for litigation. DAFS referred questions to the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which is now handling the contract dispute with Workday, under which DAFS seeks $22 million in refunds and compensation. The Attorney General\u2019s Office declined to comment, answer questions or provide information about the status of the Workday dispute.\n Gov. Janet Mills\u2019 spokesperson said in an email that she would like to see the dispute resolved \u201cin an efficient and timely manner so that the State may move forward in the most cost-effective way with replacing its severely outdated system.\u201d\n  The Press Herald reviewed hundreds of pages of letters, contracts, emails, meeting minutes, reports and presentations about the troubled project provided to the legislative oversight committee or directly to the newspaper, some of which had not previously been made public.\n The newspaper also spoke with three former state contractors who worked on the project, all of whom dispute the commissioner\u2019s characterization of events, telling the Press Herald that the effort was damaged by distracted senior management, shifting requirements from the state, a work environment that turned toxic, and the state\u2019s failure to recruit and hire experienced and qualified personnel to staff the state\u2019s side of the complex implementation effort.\n  Two of the former contractors asked that their names not be published because they fear professional repercussions for speaking out. The exception was Ahmadah Afif, a Maryland-based global training consultant who worked on the Workday Maine project from February 2019 to May 2020.\n Afif, who has helped states, universities and local governments across the country implement Workday and other complex software systems, said the underlying problem became clear soon after she relocated to Augusta and began working on the project.\n \u201cMaine didn\u2019t have the right people in the right places, and the rates they were offering were not going to bring the right expertise to Maine,\u201d Afif said. \u201cIn order to save money, they gave jobs to people with little or no experience. It was like: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to drop you in the fire. Dance for me!\u2019\u201d\n Another former state contractor said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us were qualified for the jobs we had. They were quick to hire whoever they could.\u201d\n With DAFS declining to answer most questions for this story, the Press Herald was unable to independently determine the technical qualifications of managers and contractors to execute the demanding implementation.\n There were management problems as well, the contractors said, with inexperienced managers, a lack of attention from the department\u2019s top officials, and, in one case, inappropriate behavior.\n At an appropriations committee hearing March 4, state Rep. Justin Fecteau, R-Augusta, caused  a stir when he said he would not support new funding for the project because he had \u201clearned of probable sexual misconduct in the program directed at the capable women who work there.\u201d\n The Press Herald spoke with a state contractor who said she had been among several victims of sexual harassment by a manager, a state employee, and had filed a complaint with DAFS\u2019 human resources department. The employee said the manager had frequently made offensive comments to and about female state employees and Workday contractors, including references to their menstrual cycles and his desire to be romantically involved with them.\n The human resources department, she said, had recently informed her that its investigation had concluded and that the manager would remain. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the only one to make a complaint, but somehow he is still in the same post he\u2019s in,\u201d the contractor said, adding that this manager\u2019s behavior damaged staff morale.\n DAFS spokesperson Kelsey Goldsmith confirmed that the investigation \u2013 conducted by outside legal counsel contracted by the Attorney General\u2019s Office \u2013 had found the accusations did \u201cnot meet the legal definition of hostile workplace or harassment of any kind.\u201d\n  The effort to replace the state\u2019s HR management system goes back to 2016, when then-Gov. Paul LePage contracted Infor, a New York firm, to replace it for $13.5 million. That company proved incapable of delivering the promised system, and in November 2018 the LePage administration signed contracts with Workday to provide both the software and an implementation team to work alongside state contractors and staff to get the new system launched by Jan. 1, 2020. The price was $15 million.\n By the time the project got underway in January 2019, Janet Mills was in the Blaine House and Figueroa, a  former colleague of the governor at the Attorney General\u2019s Office, had taken the leadership of DAFS. In the coming months, the state hired contractors to work alongside Workday\u2019s consultants to complete the wide-ranging project, which included customized cloud-based software for payroll, recruitment, time tracking, benefits administration and security.\n   In formal letters later sent to Workday, Figueroa asserted that reports to the department\u2019s Executive Steering Committee \u201cthroughout the project were rosy and optimistic\u201d and that \u201cat no point was the ESC given any indication of the depth and magnitude of the problems.\u201d\n But minutes and presentations from the Executive Steering Committee\u2019s meetings show senior department leaders were well-apprised of the unfolding crisis starting in August 2019, when the group began contemplating pushing the \u201cgo online\u201d deadline from Jan. 1 to March 31, 2020, because of ongoing personnel shortages and testing delays. Minutes from their Aug. 22 meeting \u2013 attended by senior state managers and Workday consultants \u2013 said such a contingency plan had been discussed with the commissioner and had her support.\n The independent auditor Maine hired to evaluate the project, Panorama Government Solutions, completed a report the same day that judged the project to be in \u201cyellow\u201d status overall, warning of tight timelines and fatigue among project staff already working overtime. It warned the project \u201cwill quickly move to Red should something unforeseen arise in Testing or elsewhere on the project that causes delays.\u201d\n \u201cThis feels like the movie \u2018Apollo 13,\u2019\u201d the department\u2019s chief information officer, Fred Brittain, said at a special meeting of the committee on Sept. 13, 2019, referring to the film about how moon-bound astronauts saved themselves through improvised onboard repairs after an explosion damaged their spacecraft. \u201cAre we going to splash down on water or burn down on entry?\u201d\n Thirteen days later, the ESC concluded that the entire project was \u201csignificantly at risk\u201d because of testing problems and other issues. The 15 attendees \u2013 including Brittain, Deputy Commissioner Heather Perreault and at least two Workday consultants \u2013 unanimously recommended moving the deadline, meeting minutes show, though the final decision to do so didn\u2019t come until November.\n   Testing of the payroll portion of the Workday system revealed enormous problems. Figueroa later testified to legislators that the system had a greater than 50 percent \u201cerror rate\u201d but that Workday pressured the state to go ahead with an April 1, 2020, launch all the same.\n A Workday spokesman, Sion Rogers, said via email that neither assertion is accurate. The problem lay not with Workday\u2019s system, which was calculating payroll accurately, but with the data being imported from the state\u2019s existing system, which was filled with errors and inaccuracies. \u201cWorkday did not recommend the State go-live\u201d on April 1, Rogers said. \u201cRather, Workday answered questions and provided guidance to help the State make its decision.\u201d\n The former contractors agreed the payroll problem was with the legacy data for the 12,000 employees covered by the system, a shortcoming also mentioned in several of Panorama\u2019s periodic reports on the project. In essence, the state in many instances hasn\u2019t been calculating pay in accordance with the rules and parameters it provided Workday during the system\u2019s design phase, which resulted in large numbers of variances when the systems were tested side by side.\n \u201cThey wanted the payroll to match the old system, but the old system wasn\u2019t paying people correctly,\u201d one said. \u201cIt uncovered that people were being paid improperly.\u201d\n Afif said the payroll modules of HR management systems are by far the most complex and difficult to execute. Governments have diverse workforces, from police officers to hospital staff to librarians, drivers and boat captains, with different rules, union memberships and requirements. \u201cPayroll is always problematic, no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pull it together if you don\u2019t have experienced people who know how the process works.\u201d\n In Maine\u2019s case, two other former contractors said, the state police had a wide range of small hourly pay differentials based on whether a given officer had spent time working with a K9, wearing scuba gear, or carrying a weapon, which generated a huge number of variances.\n \u201cIn any case, payroll was dead on arrival in early 2020 because of the testing results and needed to be reworked,\u201d one said. \u201cAt that point they could have cut payroll out to work on and rolled out benefits, recruiting, security, time management and the other modules that were ready to go, but they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n  Instead, state officials decided to put the brakes on everything and hire somebody to come in and sort out the mess. That somebody would turn out to be the commissioner\u2019s husband, Doug Birgfeld.\n Birgfeld, who had been working at the Department of Economic and Community Development since shortly after Mills became governor, was hired to resurrect and head DAFS\u2019 Project Management Office, a position he had held for the three and a half years until LePage shut it down in 2016 as part of his  drive to slash the state workforce. The department tasked him with undertaking a strategic review to put the project back on track. He received $114,280 in wages and benefits from this staff position during 2020, state records show.\n  The department says his hiring was legal because officials acted in accordance with  the state\u2019s nepotism rules and laws, which prohibit family members from making the final decision to hire relatives but allow relatives to serve in jobs overseen by them.\n \u201cBirgfeld was selected by (Chief Information Officer) Brittain from a competitive pool of applications for the role of Director and Birgfeld reports directly to Brittain,\u201d DAFS spokesperson Goldsmith said via email. \u201cCommissioner Figueroa was not involved in his hiring.\u201d\n Goldsmith provided a written statement from Brittain in which he said the commissioner wasn\u2019t involved in the process and had proactively alerted him that her husband was applying and \u201cthat she did not want to be involved or consulted in any way.\u201d Brittain said he chose Birgfeld from a field of \u201cthree well-qualified finalists.\u201d\n Scott H. Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a government ethics group in Washington, D.C., said such hires are still problematic.\n \u201cAny situation in which a senior official is overseeing their spouse is a recipe for waste and abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat scenario should be avoided and appropriate screening should take place. These ethics dilemmas are easy to avoid, and another qualified candidate should have been hired.\u201d\n Asked about Birgfeld\u2019s hiring, the governor\u2019s press secretary, Lindsay Crete, said via email that the administration adheres to state laws governing the hiring of family relations and \u201cfocuses on hiring the best, most qualified individuals for jobs throughout State government as required by Maine\u2019s Civil Service law.\u201d\n As Birgfeld began his review in March 2020, Panorama issued a new report warning that his intended plan to come up with a revised workplan and launch date by the end of that month was unrealistic and that if he undertook significant changes it would likely have an adverse impact on the team\u2019s productivity and morale, and that some were scheduled to move to other projects in May.\n The former contractors said morale was already flagging. \u201cPeople were leaving the building crying and others would storm out cursing and get in their car and sit there for an hour,\u201d one said. With the project at a standstill, contractors started being let go.\n When the coronavirus pandemic reached Maine in March 2020, state government went into lockdown, and DAFS became the lead agency in ensuring state buildings and employees had personal protective equipment, Plexiglas partitions, remote computer access and all the other things required to keep essential operations going.\n What went wrong in the 10 months that followed remains unclear, with the state and Workday offering fragmentary and contradictory assessments. Workday withdrew its consultants on short warning in May 2020, alarming department leaders, but then replaced them. Birgfeld developed measures meant to improve the state\u2019s governance of the stalled project but complained about a lack of \u201cday-to-day tactical support\u201d from the Workday consultants. The state and Workday went back and forth for months about whether the latter would receive additional consulting fees, with at least 42 proposals exchanged between them.\n  In September the parties appeared to try to reset their relationship and get the system implemented, but they disagreed over whether Workday should be paid for the additional work. The state hired IJA Strategies, a firm that implements Workday systems for clients, to conduct another independent assessment that detailed longstanding problems, almost all of them involving the state\u2019s side of the ledger.\n The problems IJA identified in its November 2020 report included the state frequently changing plans, deadlines, and configurations \u201cas new staff review previous design decisions\u201d; fatigue, turnover and loss of motivation among project staff; disagreements among state agencies over how statewide payroll rules should be interpreted; and bad data being loaded into the new systems from the old one, ensuring errors and delays.\n This assessment, Workday\u2019s Rogers said via email, highlighted issues the company had been raising with the state for many months. \u201cAny technology deployment is nuanced and requires both parties \u2013 the customer and vendor \u2013 to complete certain requirements on their end in order to be successful,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOn the customer side this can include project staffing, clear business and functional requirements, and data quality, among others.\u201d\n Workday says it sought to engage the department\u2019s leaders this winter in finding a path forward but were continually rebuffed, denied access to weekly status report meetings and stopped being included in Executive Steering Committee meetings.\n \u201cThere has been no discussion around the major issues that have been hindering project success such as poor data quality, resource turnover challenges, and incomplete/changing requirements due to policy interpretation, amongst other issues,\u201d Workday\u2019s senior vice president for implementation services, Christopher Curtis, wrote Deputy Commissioner Perreault on Feb. 11. \u201cAttempts to engage with the State of Maine teams are often met with resistance, deflection, defensiveness and other tactics.\u201d\n Curtis said Workday\u2019s consultants were now \u201crelegated to a staff augmentation or ad-hoc consulting role\u201d with no real partnership or collaboration with their state counterparts. As a result, he said he was pulling them from the project Feb. 12 until the department decided if it was committed to act on addressing the problems identified in the IJA report.\n Perreault responded that the state would take its time determining how to move forward with the failed project, would share its decision when it came to it, and considered Workday to have been pervasively \u201cacting in bad faith.\u201d She said that if Workday\u2019s consultants paused work, the state would consider the company to be in default of its contract.\n Two weeks later, Figueroa put Workday on notice that it was being fired as implementation partner as of March 9. The state, which has paid Workday about $7.5 million to date, is seeking $22 million from the company, including compensation for having to keep the legacy system going. Workday rejects the claim, and the matter has been turned over to the Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n In March, Rep. Fecteau asked for the Legislature\u2019s watchdog agency, the Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability, to launch a formal investigation of the project. The government oversight committee, which must approve such a request, held a hearing April 9 where Figueroa gave her testimony, but has decided not to act until after the state resolves its $22 million dispute with the company.\n \u201cOPEGA investigations require considerable resources from the agency or department involved,\u201d the House chair of the committee, Rep.

The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|&gt;3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in  post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the  in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.\n    This work was primarily supported by a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award 215573/Z/19/Z.

A disease colloquially referred to as The Sick spreads rapidly among humans while overwhelming infrastructure, grinding daily life to a halt, and racking up a body count.\u00a0When this story begins, society tries to put itself together again. An unnamed narrator calls it &#34;The Great Crumble.&#34;\n This disaster, however, can&#39;t be contained even to the extent of COVID-19. No cure or vaccination has been discovered, so most humans opt to live in isolation either as individuals or as disease-free groups. This withdrawal has allowed nature to essentially step into the void\u2014animals previously only seen in a zoo roam free, and landscapes grow out in full to replenish what society previously destroyed for resources.\n Oh, and in  Sweet Tooth,\u00a0the\u00a0next generation of kids appears to include half-animal/half-human individuals called Hybrids. The ratio of column A to column B varies\u2014some talk, some don&#39;t; many look like traditional kids with small animal features; all retain abilities like heightened hearing or smell\u2014but no one seems to know anything for sure . Why did this evolution happen? How many are there? And, most pertinent, what makes Hybrids immune to The Sick? In the face of all that mystery, some portions of this new world look at Hybrids as a hopeful evolution of humanity, a group of individuals society should protect and help thrive. Others, though, see Hybrids as a hindrance to humanity getting past The Sick and returning to normalcy. In particular, Hybrids&#39; immunity to The Sick has swaths of this new world curious about whether their DNA can be harvested for treatment or prevention.\n In the middle of this whole mess sits Gus, a deerboy Hybrid who simply lived a quiet life in an isolated Yellowstone cabin with his father until, well, you can probably see where this is headed. Luckily, that predictability doesn&#39;t make the journey ahead any less fun.\n     So, our\u00a0 Tom Sawyer-loving deerkid has to set off on a country-traversing adventure of his own, and throughout, he&#39;ll encounter numerous individuals with unknown motives who may want him dead or may partner up to become a  found family of sorts. I watched a large portion of the series with a teen sibling, and needless to say they were able to call out many of the individual episode&#39;s twists and turns.\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0covers  a lot of well-worn movie and TV territory, but it will still likely have you in for the long haul if you&#39;re fond of any of the numerous kids-versus-the-world adventures of yore (from\u00a0 The Goonies\u00a0to\u00a0 Harry Potter).\n    That said, I was amused by the series&#39; unique approach to some common aspects of its intersecting genres (kid adventure, post-apocalypse). When Gus and his first new partymate (a former football player turned hunter/assassin named Tommy Jeppard, aka Big Man) inevitably encounter a militarized group of people, that community\u00a0 isn&#39;t\u00a0full of former cadets or marines. Instead, this amateur army learned its tactics because they were previously a devoted group of friends who played games like\u00a0 Overwatch\u00a0or\u00a0 Halo.\u00a0And the scientists who remain and must sort out this disease mess aren&#39;t former government lab jockeys; they used to be regular-old medical care providers. They very much continue to grapple with the trauma of watching all these patients of The Sick deteriorate as this new world asks them to step up and lead, so these docs have their humanity in tact rather than operating only with some &#34;anything for the greater good&#34; mentality.\n  It would be very, very easy for\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0to become too dark, too emotionally heavy, or too tiresome for viewers who have lived some of this stuff IRL in the last 16 months. Again and again, the show gave me flashbacks to when I used to follow\u00a0  The Walking Dead , which I had quit watching\u00a0entirely after hours and hours of despair. Like  TWD,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0has our heroes going through cycles where they encounter many different groups of people who initially seem nice and helpful only to reveal themselves to be something else later on, often with tragic results. (When will people in TV and film learn that there may be no scarier, more dangerous place than white picket fence-lined suburban neighborhoods?  Sigh.)\u00a0In another notable zombie-brains-show similarity, the bad guys (whether that&#39;s a disease or a disassociated lunatic military man) seem to come out on top more often than not, at least in these first eight episodes.\n Despite that,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0never veers entirely into ruin porn or nihilism. Mostly, that&#39;s because of its central figure. Unlike Rick Grimes ( The Walking Dead), June (  Handmaid&#39;s Tale), or many other characters existing in an apocalyptic new reality,\u00a0Gus is still a kid. The world hasn&#39;t beaten him down into expecting the worst all the time, and his general optimism and wonder keep this story feeling light enough despite many gut punches along the way.\u00a0 Sweet Tooth&#39;s source comic wrapped in 2013, and production on this Netflix series  began long before COVID-19 took over. The creative team had already made a few decisions to tone down the bleakness of the source material, and the benefits of\u00a0those choices are only amplified by the context viewers bring to the show in summer 2021.\n    I have yet to actively seek out any pandemic-related pop culture. Maybe my appetite for it will eventually change, though let&#39;s revisit that in a decade.\u00a0But given how all-encompassing this ongoing global situation has been, of course you can&#39;t help but consume some of it, even by accident. For me, the stuff that works so far has had some degree of optimism or hope underneath the adversity, chaos, and tragedy. The risotto episode of   How to With John Wilson, for instance, includes overrun grocery stores and scenes from hospitals, but it ends by underscoring our need for human interaction and the newly realized immense value in it.\n On the surface,  Sweet Tooth isn&#39;t about the pandemic at all. This show is for teens, and it is not subtle about hammering home a central idea regarding humanity&#39;s role in destroying our planet through climate change and an insatiable thirst for more. However, the show&#39;s plot prominently features a worldwide pandemic, making it impossible to not think about that through the lens of these eight episodes. Ultimately,  Sweet Tooth\u00a0points to a few positive messages amid the disease darkness.\n First, don&#39;t be jerks to the youngest generation. We don&#39;t yet know how this will impact them, and they are the future who will unravel this mess and navigate its lasting impact. Additionally, pushing forward necessitates extending kindness to others. The weight of the world is emotionally on everyone&#39;s shoulders (if not physically, to a large extent). And when it&#39;s impossible to know when your next event, trip, family reunion, or whatever thing you look forward to will happen, some other kind of hope must exist for you to believe in if you want any chance at emotional and mental survival. Gus gives that hope to admittedly broken-down individuals like Big Man, and it&#39;s easy to imagine him spreading that optimistic outlook wider in S2 given the pessimistic way things wrap this time around.\n Traditionally, summer always felt like\u00a0a dumping ground for networks to try unusual things as people vacation or generally get out more; bigger series headliners tend to wait for fall returns or premieres accordingly (see   Y: The Last Man\u00a0or\u00a0  The Foundation\u00a0in 2021). But recent years have seen surprises emerge at the end of spring and become their own critical darlings (HBO&#39;s\u00a0  Los Espookys) or megafranchises (  Stranger Things). Whether\u00a0 Sweet Tooth\u00a0can travel the same surprise path to stardom remains to be seen, but it&#39;s at least nice to have a new show worth following as we enter another summer where travel might be complicated (though, mercifully, not as complicated as it is in  Sweet Tooth).", "posttime": "2021-06-20 21:52:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b,tooth,\u751c\u98df", "title": "\u751c\u98df\u662f\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u540e\u671f\u7684\u7968\u4ef7 - \u4f46\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u5b83\u7684\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u6b7b\u4eba\u6c1b\u56f4 ", "title_en": "Sweet Tooth is hopeful post-apocalyptic fare\u2014but beware its Walking Dead vibes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/sweet-tooth-is-hopeful-post-apocalyptic-fare-but-beware-its-walking-dead-vibes/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5145\u6ee1\u5e0c\u671b", "tooth", "\u751c\u98df"]}]
