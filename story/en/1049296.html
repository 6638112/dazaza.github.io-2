It weighed three and a half pounds. I put it in a canvas tote bag and packed it in my suitcase this past July for the transpacific flight to Manila. From there I would travel by car to a rural village. When I arrived, I would hand over all that was left of the woman who had spent 56 years as a slave in my family’s household.</p><p>  T黑色的塑料盒，大小与烤面包机差不多。它重三磅半。去年7月，我将其放在帆布手提袋中，并装在手提箱中，准备飞往马尼拉的跨太平洋航班。从那里，我会开车去一个乡村。当我到达时，我将把剩下56岁的奴隶作为家庭奴隶的那个女人的所有遗物全部交给我。</p><p>  Her name was Eudocia Tomas Pulido. We called her Lola. She was 4 foot 11, with mocha-brown skin and almond eyes that I can still see looking into mine—my first memory. She was 18 years old when my grandfather gave her to my mother as a gift, and when my family moved to the United States, we brought her with us. No other word but  slave encompassed the life she lived. Her days began before everyone else woke and ended after we went to bed. She prepared three meals a day, cleaned the house, waited on my parents, and took care of my four siblings and me. My parents never paid her, and they scolded her constantly. She wasn’t kept in leg irons, but she might as well have been. So many nights, on my way to the bathroom, I’d spot her sleeping in a corner, slumped against a mound of laundry, her fingers clutching a garment she was in the middle of folding.</p><p>  她的名字叫Eudocia Tomas Pulido。我们叫她萝拉。她身高4英尺11岁，有着摩卡咖啡色的皮肤和杏仁色的眼睛，我仍然可以看到我的第一个记忆。当我的祖父将她作为礼物送给母亲时，她才18岁，而当我的家人移居美国时，我们就把她带来了。除了奴隶之外，没有其他词可以涵盖她的生活。她的日子开始于其他人都还没有醒来，结束于我们上床睡觉之后。她每天准备三顿饭，打扫房子，等我的父母，并照顾我的四个兄弟姐妹。我的父母从来没有付过她钱，他们不断地责骂她。她没有被束缚住脚，但她也应该一直保持。这么多晚上，在去洗手间的路上，我发现她睡在一个角落里，斜躺在一堆洗衣房里，她的手指抓着她正在折叠的衣服。</p><p> Listen to the audio version of this article: Feature stories, read aloud:  download the Audm app for your iPhone.</p><p> 收听本文的音频版本：专题故事，大声阅读：为您的iPhone下载Audm应用程序。</p><p>  To our American neighbors, we were model immigrants, a poster family. They told us so. My father had a law degree, my mother was on her way to becoming a doctor, and my siblings and I got good grades and always said “please” and “thank you.” We never talked about Lola. Our secret went to the core of who we were and, at least for us kids, who we wanted to be.</p><p>  对于我们的美国邻居来说，我们是模范移民，一个海报家庭。他们是这样告诉我们的。父亲拥有法律学位，母亲正要当医生，我的兄弟姐妹和我的成绩都很好，总是说“请”和“谢谢”。我们从未谈论过萝拉。我们的秘密进入了我们的核心，至少对于我们的孩子们来说，我们想成为谁。</p><p> After my mother died of leukemia, in 1999, Lola came to live with me in a small town north of Seattle. I had a family, a career, a house in the suburbs—the American dream. And then I had a slave.</p><p> 我母亲死于白血病之后，1999年，萝拉（Lola）来西雅图西雅图以北的一个小镇与我住在一起。我在郊区有一个家庭，一个职业，一个房子，这是美国梦。然后我有了一个奴隶。 </p><p> in Manila, I unzipped my suitcase to make sure Lola’s ashes were still there. Outside, I inhaled the familiar smell: a thick blend of exhaust and waste, of ocean and sweet fruit and sweat.</p><p>在马尼拉，我解开了行李箱的拉链，以确保洛拉的骨灰还在那里。在外面，我吸入了熟悉的气味：废气和废物，海洋，甜美的水果和汗水的浓密混合物。</p><p> Early the next morning I found a driver, an affable middle-aged man who went by the nickname “Doods,” and we hit the road in his truck, weaving through traffic. The scene always stunned me. The sheer number of cars and motorcycles and jeepneys. The people weaving between them and moving on the sidewalks in great brown rivers. The street vendors in bare feet trotting alongside cars, hawking cigarettes and cough drops and sacks of boiled peanuts. The child beggars pressing their faces against the windows.</p><p> 第二天一早，我发现了一个司机，一个和可亲的中年男子，绰号为“ Doods”，我们乘坐他的卡车上路，在交通中穿行。现场总是让我震惊。数量众多的汽车，摩托车和吉普车。人们在他们之间编织并在褐色的大河中的人行道上移动。街头小贩赤着脚小跑在汽车旁边，兜售香烟，咳嗽药水和煮熟的花生袋。那个乞pressing把孩子的脸按在窗户上。</p><p>  Doods and I were headed to the place where Lola’s story began, up north in the central plains: Tarlac province. Rice country. The home of a cigar-chomping army lieutenant named Tomas Asuncion, my grandfather. The family stories paint Lieutenant Tom as a formidable man given to eccentricity and dark moods, who had lots of land but little money and kept mistresses in separate houses on his property. His wife died giving birth to their only child, my mother. She was raised by a series of  utusans, or “people who take commands.”</p><p>  Doods和我前往洛拉（Lola）的故事开始的地方，在中部平原北部：塔拉克（Tarlac）省。水稻国家。我祖父名叫Tomas Asuncion的陆军雪茄中尉的家。家族故事将汤姆中尉描绘成一个令人生畏的人，他举止古怪，情绪低落，他有很多土地，却很少钱，并把情妇留在他的财产中。他的妻子去世，生下了他们唯一的孩子，我的母亲。她由一系列的乌托邦人抚养长大，或称“接受命令的人”。</p><p>  Slavery has a long history on the islands. Before the Spanish came, islanders enslaved other islanders, usually war captives, criminals, or debtors. Slaves came in different varieties, from warriors who could earn their freedom through valor to household servants who were regarded as property and could be bought and sold or traded. High-status slaves could own low-status slaves, and the low could own the lowliest. Some chose to enter servitude simply to survive: In exchange for their labor, they might be given food, shelter, and protection.</p><p>  奴隶制在这些岛屿上有着悠久的历史。在西班牙人来之前，岛民奴役了其他岛民，通常是战俘，罪犯或债务人。奴隶的种类各异，从可以通过英勇挣脱自由的战士到被视为财产并可以买卖的奴仆。高地位的奴隶可以拥有低地位的奴隶，低地位的奴隶可以拥有最低地位的奴隶。有些人只是为了生存而选择奴役：为了交换劳动，他们可能会得到食物，住所和保护。</p><p>  When the Spanish arrived, in the 1500s, they enslaved islanders and later brought African and Indian slaves. The Spanish Crown eventually began phasing out slavery at home and in its colonies, but parts of the Philippines were so far-flung that authorities couldn’t keep a close eye. Traditions persisted under different guises, even after the U.S. took control of the islands in 1898. Today even the poor can have  utusans or  katulongs (“helpers”) or  kasambahays (“domestics”), as long as there are people even poorer. The pool is deep.</p><p>  当西班牙人到达时，在1500年代，他们奴役了岛民，后来又带来了非洲和印度的奴隶。西班牙王室最终开始在国内和殖民地逐步取消奴隶制，但菲律宾的部分地区如此遥远，当局无法密切关注。即使在美国于1898年控制了这些岛屿之后，传统仍然以不同的面貌继续存在。今天，即使有穷人，即使是穷人也可以拥有乌托邦人或katulongs（“帮手”）或kasambahays（“家庭”）。游泳池很深。</p><p> Lieutenant Tom had as many as three families of  utusans living on his property. In the spring of 1943, with the islands under Japanese occupation, he brought home a girl from a village down the road. She was a cousin from a marginal side of the family, rice farmers. The lieutenant was shrewd—he saw that this girl was penniless, unschooled, and likely to be malleable. Her parents wanted her to marry a pig farmer twice her age, and she was desperately unhappy but had nowhere to go. Tom approached her with an offer: She could have food and shelter if she would commit to taking care of his daughter, who had just turned 12.</p><p> 汤姆中尉在他的住所上居住着多达三个家庭的乌托邦人。 1943年春天，在日本人占领的岛屿上，他从路边的一个村庄带回了一个女孩。她是家庭边缘农民的表弟。中尉很机灵-他看到这个女孩身无分文，没有受过教育，而且很可能具有韧性。她的父母希望她嫁给一个两倍大的养猪户，她极度不幸，但无处可去。汤姆向她求婚：如果她愿意照顾刚满12岁的女儿，她可以有食物和住所。</p><p>  “I don’t want her,” my mother said, knowing she had no choice.</p><p>  母亲说：“我不要她。”她知道她别无选择。 </p><p> Lieutenant Tom went off to fight the Japanese, leaving Mom behind with Lola in his creaky house in the provinces. Lola fed, groomed, and dressed my mother. When they walked to the market, Lola held an umbrella to shield her from the sun. At night, when Lola’s other tasks were done—feeding the dogs, sweeping the floors, folding the laundry that she had washed by hand in the Camiling River—she sat at the edge of my mother’s bed and fanned her to sleep.</p><p>汤姆中尉去抗击日本人，把妈妈和萝拉留在他在各省的破烂房子里。萝拉（Lola）喂饱，打扮和打扮我的母亲。当他们走进市场时，萝拉（Lola）撑起雨伞以保护她免受阳光照射。到了晚上，劳拉完成了其他任务（喂狗，扫地，折叠她用手工在Camiling河中洗过的衣服）之后，她坐在母亲床边，扇着她入睡。</p><p>  One day during the war Lieutenant Tom came home and caught my mother in a lie—something to do with a boy she wasn’t supposed to talk to. Tom, furious, ordered her to “stand at the table.” Mom cowered with Lola in a corner. Then, in a quivering voice, she told her father that Lola would take her punishment. Lola looked at Mom pleadingly, then without a word walked to the dining table and held on to the edge. Tom raised the belt and delivered 12 lashes, punctuating each one with a word.  You. Do. Not. Lie. To. Me. You. Do. Not. Lie. To. Me. Lola made no sound.</p><p>  战争期间的一天，汤姆中尉回家骗了我妈妈，这与一个不该和她说话的男孩有关。汤姆大怒，命令她“站在桌子旁”。妈妈在角落里向萝拉退缩。然后，她颤抖的声音告诉父亲，萝拉会受到惩罚。萝拉恳求地看着妈妈，然后一言不发地走到餐桌旁，紧紧抓住边缘。汤姆抬起皮带，送了12根睫毛，每根都用一个单词点了一下。你。做。不是。说谎。到。我。你。做。不是。说谎。到。我。萝拉没有发声。</p><p>  My mother, in recounting this story late in her life, delighted in the outrageousness of it, her tone seeming to say,  Can you believe I did that? When I brought it up with Lola, she asked to hear Mom’s version. She listened intently, eyes lowered, and afterward she looked at me with sadness and said simply, “Yes. It was like that.”</p><p>  我的母亲在讲述她生命中的这个故事时，对它的残酷无比感到高兴，她的语气似乎在说：你能相信我做到了吗？当我与萝拉（Lola）提起影片时，她要求听妈妈的版本。她专心地听着，眼睛低下，然后她悲伤地看着我，简单地说：“是的。就是这样。”</p><p> Seven years later, in 1950, Mom married my father and moved to Manila, bringing Lola along. Lieutenant Tom had long been haunted by demons, and in 1951 he silenced them with a .32‑caliber slug to his temple. Mom almost never talked about it. She had his temperament—moody, imperial, secretly fragile—and she took his lessons to heart, among them the proper way to be a provincial  matrona: You must embrace your role as the giver of commands. You must keep those beneath you in their place at all times, for their own good and the good of the household. They might cry and complain, but their souls will thank you. They will love you for helping them be what God intended.</p><p> 七年后的1950年，妈妈嫁给了我父亲，搬到马尼拉，带了萝拉。汤姆中尉长期以来一直被恶魔困扰，并于1951年以0.32口径的to弹使他们沉默，使他无法进入神殿。妈妈几乎从未谈论过它。她有他的气质-喜怒无常，帝国，秘密的脆弱-她怀念着他的教训，其中包括成为省长的正确方法：您必须接受作为命令给予者的角色。为了自己的利益和家庭的利益，您必须始终将自己下方的人安置在自己的位置。他们可能会哭泣和抱怨，但他们的灵魂会感谢您。他们会爱你，因为他们帮助他们实现了神的意图。</p><p>  My brother Arthur was born in 1951. I came next, followed by three more siblings in rapid succession. My parents expected Lola to be as devoted to us kids as she was to them. While she looked after us, my parents went to school and earned advanced degrees, joining the ranks of so many others with fancy diplomas but no jobs. Then the big break: Dad was offered a job in Foreign Affairs as a commercial analyst. The salary would be meager, but the position was in America—a place he and Mom had grown up dreaming of, where everything they hoped for could come true.</p><p>  我的兄弟亚瑟（Arthur）于1951年出生。我紧随其后，紧随其后的是另外三个兄弟姐妹。我的父母希望萝拉能像对待孩子一样忠于我们的孩子。当她照顾我们时，我的父母上学并获得了高级学位，加入了许多其他人的行列，他们拥有精美的文凭，但没有工作。然后是一个重大突破：父亲获得了外交事务的商业分析师职位。薪水虽然微薄，但这个职位是在美国-他和妈妈长大的梦想的地方，他们希望的一切都可以实现。</p><p> Dad was allowed to bring his family and one domestic. Figuring they would both have to work, my parents needed Lola to care for the kids and the house. My mother informed Lola, and to her great irritation, Lola didn’t immediately acquiesce. Years later Lola told me she was terrified. “It was too far,” she said. “Maybe your Mom and Dad won’t let me go home.”</p><p> 爸爸被允许带家人和一个家。考虑到他们俩都必须工作，我的父母需要萝拉照顾孩子和房子。我的母亲通知了萝拉，但令她非常恼火的是，萝拉没有立即默认。多年后，萝拉告诉我她很害怕。她说：“太远了。” “也许你爸爸妈妈不会让我回家。”</p><p>  In the end what convinced Lola was my father’s promise that things would be different in America. He told her that as soon as he and Mom got on their feet, they’d give her an “allowance.” Lola could send money to her parents, to all her relations in the village. Her parents lived in a hut with a dirt floor. Lola could build them a concrete house, could change their lives forever.  Imagine.</p><p>  最后，使劳拉信服的是我父亲的诺言，即美国情况将有所不同。他告诉她，一旦他和妈妈站起来，他们就会给她“津贴”。罗拉可以把钱寄给她的父母，以及她在村里的所有亲戚。她的父母住在一个有尘土地板的小屋里。萝拉可以给他们盖一栋水泥房子，可以永远改变他们的生活。想象。 </p><p> We landed in Los Angeles on May 12, 1964, all our belongings in cardboard boxes tied with rope. Lola had been with my mother for 21 years by then. In many ways she was more of a parent to me than either my mother or my father. Hers was the first face I saw in the morning and the last one I saw at night. As a baby, I uttered Lola’s name (which I first pronounced “Oh-ah”) long before I learned to say “Mom” or “Dad.” As a toddler, I refused to go to sleep unless Lola was holding me, or at least nearby.</p><p>1964年5月12日，我们降落在洛杉矶，所有物品都装在用绳子捆着的纸板箱中。到那时，萝拉已经和我妈妈在一起21年了。从很多方面来说，她对我来说都是父母，而不是母亲或父亲。她的是我早上见到的第一张脸，而晚上是我见到的最后一张脸。在我还是婴儿的时候，我很早就说出了萝拉的名字（我首先发音为“哦-啊”），后来才学会说“妈妈”或“爸爸”。作为一个蹒跚学步的孩子，除非罗拉（Lola）抱着我或至少在附近，否则我拒绝睡觉。</p><p> I was 4 years old when we arrived in the U.S.—too young to question Lola’s place in our family. But as my siblings and I grew up on this other shore, we came to see the world differently. The leap across the ocean brought about a leap in consciousness that Mom and Dad couldn’t, or wouldn’t, make.</p><p> 当我们到达美国时，我只有4岁，还太年轻，无法质疑萝拉在我们家庭中的地位。但是，当我和兄弟姐妹在另一岸长大时，我们开始以不同的方式看待世界。跨越海洋的飞跃带来了父母无法或不会意识到的意识飞跃。</p><p> that allowance. She asked my parents about it in a roundabout way a couple of years into our life in America. Her mother had fallen ill (with what I would later learn was dysentery), and her family couldn’t afford the medicine she needed. “ Pwede ba?” she said to my parents.  Is it possible? Mom let out a sigh. “How could you even ask?,” Dad responded in Tagalog. “You see how hard up we are. Don’t you have any shame?”</p><p> 那笔津贴。她问了我父母关于我们在美国生活几年的round回事。她的母亲病倒了（后来我得知是痢疾），她的家人负担不起所需的药物。 “ Pwede ba？”她对我父母说。是否有可能？妈妈叹了口气。 “你怎么可能问？”，爸爸在他加禄语中回答。 “你知道我们有多努力。你不丢脸吗？”</p><p>  My parents had borrowed money for the move to the U.S., and then borrowed more in order to stay. My father was transferred from the consulate general in L.A. to the Philippine consulate in Seattle. He was paid $5,600 a year. He took a second job cleaning trailers, and a third as a debt collector. Mom got work as a technician in a couple of medical labs. We barely saw them, and when we did they were often exhausted and snappish.</p><p>  我的父母借了钱去美国，然后借了更多钱来留下。我父亲从洛杉矶的总领事馆转移到西雅图的菲律宾总领事馆。他的年薪为5,600美元。他第二次清洁拖车，第三次作为收债员。妈妈在几个医学实验室当技术员。我们几乎看不到它们，而当我们这样做时，它们常常精疲力尽。</p><p> Mom would come home and upbraid Lola for not cleaning the house well enough or for forgetting to bring in the mail. “Didn’t I tell you I want the letters here when I come home?” she would say in Tagalog, her voice venomous. “It’s not hard  naman! An idiot could remember.” Then my father would arrive and take his turn. When Dad raised his voice, everyone in the house shrank. Sometimes my parents would team up until Lola broke down crying, almost as though that was their goal.</p><p> 妈妈会回家，惹恼萝拉（Lola），因为他们打扫房间的程度不够好或忘了带邮件。 “我不是告诉你我回家后要来这里的信吗？”她会在他加禄语中说她的声音有毒。 “这不是很难的纳曼！一个白痴可以记住。”然后我父亲就到了，轮到他了。当爸爸提高声音时，家里的每个人都在收缩。有时候，我的父母会团结起来，直到萝拉哭泣，这几乎就是他们的目标。</p><p> It confused me: My parents were good to my siblings and me, and we loved them. But they’d be affectionate to us kids one moment and vile to Lola the next. I was 11 or 12 when I began to see Lola’s situation clearly. By then Arthur, eight years my senior, had been seething for a long time. He was the one who introduced the word  slave into my understanding of what Lola was. Before he said it I’d thought of her as just an unfortunate member of the household. I hated when my parents yelled at her, but it hadn’t occurred to me that they—and the whole arrangement—could be immoral.</p><p> 这让我感到困惑：我的父母对我和我的兄弟姐妹都很好，我们爱他们。但是他们一会儿对我们的孩子深情，一会儿又对萝拉有害。当我开始清楚地了解劳拉的情况时，我才11岁或12岁。那时，我八岁的亚瑟（Arthur）已经很长一段时间了。他是将奴隶一词引入我对萝拉的理解的人。在他说这句话之前，我会认为她只是一个不幸的家庭成员。我讨厌父母对她大喊大叫，但我没有想到他们和整个安排都是不道德的。</p><p>  “Do you know anybody treated the way she’s treated?,” Arthur said. “Who lives the way she lives?” He summed up Lola’s reality: Wasn’t paid. Toiled every day. Was tongue-lashed for sitting too long or falling asleep too early. Was struck for talking back. Wore hand-me-downs. Ate scraps and leftovers by herself in the kitchen. Rarely left the house. Had no friends or hobbies outside the family. Had no private quarters. (Her designated place to sleep in each house we lived in was always whatever was left—a couch or storage area or corner in my sisters’ bedroom. She often slept among piles of laundry.)</p><p>  “你知道有人对待她的方式吗？”亚瑟说。 “谁过她的生活方式？”他总结了萝拉的现实：没有得到报酬。每天辛苦。因坐得太久或入睡太早而被舌头lash绕。因回话而震惊。越来越卑鄙。在厨房里独自吃掉残渣和剩菜。很少离开房子。家人之外没有朋友或爱好。没有私人宿舍。 （在我们住的每个房子里，她指定的睡觉地点总是剩下的-我姐姐卧室的沙发，储物区或角落。她经常睡在成堆的洗衣间。） </p><p>  We couldn’t identify a parallel anywhere except in slave characters on TV and in the movies. I remember watching a Western called  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon, a gunslinging rancher who barks orders at his servant, Pompey, whom he calls his “boy.”  Pick him up, Pompey. Pompey, go find the doctor. Get on back to work, Pompey! Docile and obedient, Pompey calls his master “Mistah Tom.” They have a complex relationship. Tom forbids Pompey from attending school but opens the way for Pompey to drink in a whites-only saloon. Near the end, Pompey saves his master from a fire. It’s clear Pompey both fears and loves Tom, and he mourns when Tom dies. All of this is peripheral to the main story of Tom’s showdown with bad guy Liberty Valance, but I couldn’t take my eyes off Pompey. I remember thinking:  Lola is Pompey, Pompey is Lola.</p><p>除了电视和电影中的奴隶角色外，我们无法在其他任何地方识别出平行线。我记得曾看过一部西方电影，名为《射击自由价的男人》。约翰·韦恩（John Wayne）饰演汤姆·多尼芬（Tom Doniphon），他是一个枪支农家，向他的仆人庞培（Pompey）发出命令，他称他为“男孩”。庞培，接他。庞培，去找医生。庞培，快回去工作吧！庞培温顺而听话，称他的主人为“ Mistah Tom”。他们有复杂的关系。汤姆禁止庞培上学，但为庞培开辟了只在白人专用轿车中喝酒的道路。临近尾声，庞培将他的主人从火中救了出来。很明显庞培既害怕又爱汤姆，汤姆死后他为之哀悼。所有这一切都是汤姆与坏人自由价摊牌对决的主要故事的外围内容，但我无法将目光投向庞培。我记得当时在想：萝拉是庞培，庞培是萝拉。</p><p>  One night when Dad found out that my sister Ling, who was then 9, had missed dinner, he barked at Lola for being lazy. “I tried to feed her,” Lola said, as Dad stood over her and glared. Her feeble defense only made him angrier, and he punched her just below the shoulder. Lola ran out of the room and I could hear her wailing, an animal cry.</p><p>  一天晚上，爸爸发现我9岁的姐姐Ling没吃晚饭时，他因懒惰向Lola吠叫。 “我试图养活她，”萝拉说，父亲站在她上方怒视。她微弱的防御只会使他生气，他只在肩膀下方猛击她。萝拉跑出房间，我能听到她的哭声，一种动物的叫声。</p><p>  My parents turned to look at me. They seemed startled. I felt the twitching in my face that usually preceded tears, but I wouldn’t cry this time. In Mom’s eyes was a shadow of something I hadn’t seen before. Jealousy?</p><p>  我的父母转头看着我。他们似乎吓了一跳。我感到眼泪通常先流下眼泪，但这次我不会哭。在妈妈眼中是我从未见过的阴影。妒忌？</p><p> “Are you defending your Lola?,” Dad said. “Is that what you’re doing?”</p><p> “你在捍卫你的萝拉吗？”爸爸说。 “这就是你在做什么吗？”</p><p> “Ling said she wasn’t hungry,” I said again, almost in a whisper.</p><p> “林说她不饿，”我再次低声说道。</p><p> I was 13. It was my first attempt to stick up for the woman who spent her days watching over me. The woman who used to hum Tagalog melodies as she rocked me to sleep, and when I got older would dress and feed me and walk me to school in the mornings and pick me up in the afternoons. Once, when I was sick for a long time and too weak to eat, she chewed my food for me and put the small pieces in my mouth to swallow. One summer when I had plaster casts on both legs (I had problem joints), she bathed me with a washcloth, brought medicine in the middle of the night, and helped me through months of rehabilitation. I was cranky through it all. She didn’t complain or lose patience, ever.</p><p> 我当时13岁。这是我的第一个尝试，目的是为那个花了很多时间看着我的女人坚持下去。那个曾经让他加禄语的旋律摇摇欲坠的女人，当我摇摇欲坠时，我长大以后会穿衣服，喂我，早上带我去学校，下午接我。有一次，当我生病了很长一段时间，又太虚弱不能吃东西时，她为我咀嚼了我的食物，然后把小块的东西吞进我的嘴里。一个夏天，我的双腿都贴上石膏（我的关节有问题），她用一条毛巾给我洗澡，在半夜里给我服药，并帮助我进行了几个月的康复。我很奇怪。她从没有抱怨过，也没有失去耐心。</p><p>  my parents felt no need to hide their treatment of Lola. In America, they treated her worse but took pains to conceal it. When guests came over, my parents would either ignore her or, if questioned, lie and quickly change the subject. For five years in North Seattle, we lived across the street from the Misslers, a rambunctious family of eight who introduced us to things like mustard, salmon fishing, and mowing the lawn. Football on TV. Yelling during football. Lola would come out to serve food and drinks during games, and my parents would smile and thank her before she quickly disappeared. “Who’s that little lady you keep in the kitchen?,” Big Jim, the Missler patriarch, once asked. A relative from back home, Dad said. Very shy.</p><p>  我的父母觉得没有必要隐瞒对萝拉的待遇。在美国，他们对她的待遇较差，但竭力掩饰。当客人过来时，我的父母要么无视她，要么被问到撒谎并迅速改变话题。在北西雅图，五年来，我们住在街对面的米斯勒（Misslers），一家八口八方，向我们介绍了芥末，鲑鱼捕捞和割草等事物。电视上的足球。在足球比赛中大吼大叫。萝拉会在比赛期间出来提供食物和饮料，而我的父母会微笑并感谢她，然后她很快消失了。 “你在厨房里住的那个小女人是谁？”密斯勒族长大吉姆（Big Jim）曾经问。爸爸说，他是家中的亲戚。很害羞。 </p><p>  Billy Missler, my best friend, didn’t buy it. He spent enough time at our house, whole weekends sometimes, to catch glimpses of my family’s secret. He once overheard my mother yelling in the kitchen, and when he barged in to investigate found Mom red-faced and glaring at Lola, who was quaking in a corner. I came in a few seconds later. The look on Billy’s face was a mix of embarrassment and perplexity.  What was that? I waved it off and told him to forget it.</p><p>我最好的朋友比利·米斯勒（Billy Missler）没买。他有时在整个周末度过了足够的时间在我们家中，瞥见了我家人的秘密。他曾经听见我母亲在厨房里大喊大叫，当他出门调查时发现妈妈脸红了，怒视着在角落里颤抖的萝拉。几秒钟后我来了。比利脸上的表情既尴尬又困惑。那是什么？我挥舞着，让他忘记了。</p><p> I think Billy felt sorry for Lola. He’d rave about her cooking, and make her laugh like I’d never seen. During sleepovers, she’d make his favorite Filipino dish, beef  tapa over white rice. Cooking was Lola’s only eloquence. I could tell by what she served whether she was merely feeding us or saying she loved us.</p><p> 我认为比利为萝拉感到难过。他为她做饭而疯狂，让她笑起来像我从未见过的那样。过夜时，她会做他最喜欢的菲律宾菜，牛肉米饭配白米饭。烹饪是萝拉唯一的口才。我可以通过她所提供的服务来判断她只是在喂我们食物还是在说她爱我们。</p><p> When I once referred to Lola as a distant aunt, Billy reminded me that when we’d first met I’d said she was my grandmother.</p><p> 当我曾经将洛拉（Lola）称为遥远的姨妈时，比利（Billy）提醒我，当我们初次见面时，我说她是我的祖母。</p><p>      Admitting the truth would have meant exposing us all. We spent our first decade in the country learning the ways of the new land and trying to fit in. Having a slave did not fit. Having a slave gave me grave doubts about what kind of people we were, what kind of place we came from. Whether we deserved to be accepted. I was ashamed of it all, including my complicity. Didn’t I eat the food she cooked, and wear the clothes she washed and ironed and hung in the closet? But losing her would have been devastating.</p><p>      承认真相将意味着暴露我们所有人。我们在乡下度过了最初的十年，学习新土地的方式并试图适应。奴隶不适合。有一个奴隶使我对我们是什么样的人，我们来自什么样的地方感到严重怀疑。我们是否值得接受。我为所有这一切感到羞耻，包括我的同谋。我不是吃了她煮的食物，没有穿洗过的衣服熨烫并挂在壁橱里吗？但是失去她会是毁灭性的。</p><p>  There was another reason for secrecy: Lola’s travel papers had expired in 1969, five years after we arrived in the U.S. She’d come on a special passport linked to my father’s job. After a series of fallings-out with his superiors, Dad quit the consulate and declared his intent to stay in the United States. He arranged for permanent-resident status for his family, but Lola wasn’t eligible. He was supposed to send her back.</p><p>  保密的另一个原因是：劳拉（Lola）的旅行证件在我们到达美国五年后的1969年到期。她将拿到一份与我父亲的工作有关的特殊护照。在与上级发生一系列冲突之后，爸爸辞去了领事馆，并宣布打算留在美国。他为自己的家人安排了永久居民身份，但洛拉没有资格。他应该把她送回去。</p><p>  Lola’s mother, Fermina, died in 1973; her father, Hilario, in 1979. Both times she wanted desperately to go home. Both times my parents said “Sorry.” No money, no time. The kids needed her. My parents also feared for themselves, they admitted to me later. If the authorities had found out about Lola, as they surely would have if she’d tried to leave, my parents could have gotten into trouble, possibly even been deported. They couldn’t risk it. Lola’s legal status became what Filipinos call  tago nang tago, or TNT—“on the run.” She stayed TNT for almost 20 years.</p><p>  萝拉的母亲费米娜（Fermina）于1973年去世。她的父亲希拉里奥（Hilario）于1979年。她两次都迫切希望回家。我父母两次都说“对不起”。没有钱，没有时间。孩子们需要她。我的父母也为自己担心，他们后来向我承认。如果当局知道了萝拉（如果她想离开的话）肯定会知道，那么我的父母可能会遇到麻烦，甚至可能被驱逐出境。他们不能冒险。劳拉的法律地位成为菲律宾人称为“塔戈南塔戈”（TNT）的“奔跑”。她在TNT待了近20年。</p><p> After each of her parents died, Lola was sullen and silent for months. She barely responded when my parents badgered her. But the badgering never let up. Lola kept her head down and did her work.</p><p> 在她的每一个父母都去世之后，萝拉闷闷不乐，沉默了几个月。当我父母给她戴上徽章时，她几乎没有回应。但是徽章永远不会放松。萝拉低着头做她的工作。 </p><p>  started a turbulent period. Money got tighter, and my parents turned on each other. They uprooted the family again and again—Seattle to Honolulu back to Seattle to the southeast Bronx and finally to the truck-stop town of Umatilla, Oregon, population 750. During all this moving around, Mom often worked 24-hour shifts, first as a medical intern and then as a resident, and Dad would disappear for days, working odd jobs but also (we’d later learn) womanizing and who knows what else. Once, he came home and told us that he’d lost our new station wagon playing blackjack.</p><p>开始了动荡的时期。钱越来越紧了，我的父母彼此相拥。他们一次又一次地将家庭连根拔起，从西雅图回到檀香山，再回到西雅图，再到布朗克斯东南部，最后到俄勒冈州乌马蒂拉的卡车停放镇，人口750。一位医学实习生，然后成为居民，爸爸将消失几天，工作零工，而且（我们稍后将学习）女性化，还有谁知道。有一次，他回到家告诉我们，他失去了玩二十一点的新旅行车。</p><p> For days in a row Lola would be the only adult in the house. She got to know the details of our lives in a way that my parents never had the mental space for. We brought friends home, and she’d listen to us talk about school and girls and boys and whatever else was on our minds. Just from conversations she overheard, she could list the first name of every girl I had a crush on from sixth grade through high school.</p><p> 连续几天，萝拉将是房子里唯一的成年人。她以我父母从未拥有过的精神空间来了解我们的生活细节。我们把朋友带回家，她会听我们谈论学校，女孩和男孩以及我们其他任何想法。仅仅从她听到的谈话中，她就可以列出从六年级到高中我迷恋的每个女孩的名字。</p><p> When I was 15, Dad left the family for good. I didn’t want to believe it at the time, but the fact was that he deserted us kids and abandoned Mom after 25 years of marriage. She wouldn’t become a licensed physician for another year, and her specialty—internal medicine—wasn’t especially lucrative. Dad didn’t pay child support, so money was always a struggle.</p><p> 我15岁那年，父亲永远离开了家庭。当时我不想相信，但事实是，结婚25年后，他抛弃了我们的孩子，抛弃了妈妈。她不会再成为有执照的医生了一年，而且她的专长–内科医学并不是特别赚钱。爸爸不付孩子抚养费，所以钱一直很挣扎。</p><p>  My mom kept herself together enough to go to work, but at night she’d crumble in self-pity and despair. Her main source of comfort during this time: Lola. As Mom snapped at her over small things, Lola attended to her even more—cooking Mom’s favorite meals, cleaning her bedroom with extra care. I’d find the two of them late at night at the kitchen counter, griping and telling stories about Dad, sometimes laughing wickedly, other times working themselves into a fury over his transgressions. They barely noticed us kids flitting in and out.</p><p>  我妈妈足够团结起来上班，但是到了晚上，她在自怜和绝望中崩溃了。在这段时间里，她的主要舒适来源是萝拉。妈妈在小事上折腾她时，萝拉更多地照顾了她-烹饪妈妈最喜欢的饭菜，并格外小心地打扫卧室。我会在深夜的厨房柜台上找到他们两个，抓住并讲述关于父亲的故事，有时会恶作剧，有时则对他的过犯感到愤怒。他们几乎没有注意到我们的孩子飞来飞去。</p><p>  One night I heard Mom weeping and ran into the living room to find her slumped in Lola’s arms. Lola was talking softly to her, the way she used to with my siblings and me when we were young. I lingered, then went back to my room, scared for my mom and awed by Lola.</p><p>  一天晚上，我听到妈妈哭泣，跑进客厅，发现她陷入了萝拉的怀抱。萝拉在和她轻声交谈，她从小就跟我的兄弟姐妹和我在一起。我徘徊，然后回到我的房间，为我的妈妈感到害怕，并被萝拉敬畏。</p><p> I’d dozed for what felt like a minute and awoke to his happy melody. “Two hours more,” he said. I checked the plastic box in the tote bag by my side—still there—and looked up to see open road. The MacArthur Highway. I glanced at the time.</p><p> 我沉迷了约一分钟，惊醒了他快乐的旋律。 “再过两个小时，”他说。我在旁边检查手提袋中的塑料盒-仍在那儿-抬头看路开。麦克阿瑟公路。我当时看了一眼。</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/lolas-story/524490/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/家人/">#家人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/family/">#family</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/萝拉/">#萝拉</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
