He was warned that he could be stuck with huge mortgage costs if interest rates hit double digits like they did in the 1980s. He was told he could end up defaulting on loan payments and lose his property to foreclosure.</p><p>迈克尔·萨拉奇尼2000年第一次开始投资房地产时，他说人们告诉他他疯了。他被警告说，如果利率像20世纪80年代那样达到两位数，他可能会面临巨大的抵押贷款成本。他被告知，他最终可能会拖欠贷款，并因丧失抵押品赎回权而失去财产。</p><p> “They would always reference some obscure moment in the 1980s where interest rates went up for 24 months,” he said. “Real estate investing was not common.”</p><p>“他们总是会提到20世纪80年代的某个模糊时刻，当时利率上升了24个月，”他说。“房地产投资并不常见。”</p><p> At the time, Mr. Sarracini was a student at the University of Guelph. He used his student loan for a down payment and together with a friend and his dad as co-signer, they bought a house in Guelph for about $110,000. They added bedrooms in the basement and rented them out to fellow students. The rent covered their mortgage payments and other expenses, marking the start of Mr. Sarracini’s real estate investing career.</p><p>当时，Sarracini先生是盖尔弗大学的一名学生。他用学生贷款作为首期付款，与一位朋友和他的父亲共同签署协议，他们在圭尔夫以大约11万美元的价格买了一栋房子。他们在地下室增加了卧室，并把它们出租给同学们。租金支付了他们的抵押贷款和其他费用，标志着萨拉奇尼房地产投资生涯的开始。</p><p>  By the time he was 25, he owned more than 30 rental properties in Guelph – and was earning enough rental income to retire, he said. By the time he was 30, he had parlayed his experience into a full-time job teaching others how to invest in real estate.</p><p>他说，到25岁时，他在圭尔夫拥有30多处出租房产，并赚取足够的租金收入退休。到30岁时，他已经将自己的经验转化为一份全职工作，教别人如何投资房地产。</p><p> Now 41, Mr. Sarracini runs a property development company and a real estate investing education company. He is part of a growing group of Canadians who see real estate as the best investment to secure their financial future. Bank of Canada data shows investor buying doubled from the second quarter of 2020 to the same period in 2021. Investors now account for one-fifth of all residential buyers in Canada and their purchases have increased across the country, especially in relatively cheaper areas such as Ottawa, Gatineau, Halifax and Winnipeg.</p><p>现年41岁的萨拉奇尼经营着一家房地产开发公司和一家房地产投资教育公司。他是越来越多的加拿大人中的一员，他们认为房地产是确保他们未来财务状况的最佳投资。加拿大银行数据显示，投资者购买量从2020第二季度翻了一番，至2021同期。投资者现在占加拿大所有住宅买家的五分之一，他们的购买量在全国各地都有所增加，尤其是在渥太华、加蒂诺、哈利法克斯和温尼伯等相对便宜的地区。</p><p> “We have never seen so many new investors reach out,” said Simeon Papailias, senior partner with REC Canada, which specializes in condo sales. “It is off the charts. Everyone is seeing the market go up by 30 per cent.” Mr. Papailias said the demand for every new condo project is “nuts,” with thousands of requests to purchase.</p><p>“我们从未见过如此多的新投资者伸出援手，”专门从事公寓销售的加拿大REC高级合伙人西蒙·帕皮利亚斯说。“这超出了预期。每个人都看到市场上涨了30%。”帕皮利亚斯说，每一个新的共管公寓项目的需求都是“疯狂的”，有数千个购买请求。</p><p> The surge in interest from investors, who provide the bulk of the country’s rental units, is feeding record levels of home construction and ramping up demand for real estate. But the new buyers are also contributing to increases in home prices, by competing with would-be owners at a time when there’s an acute shortage of properties for sale. The rise in demand is influencing what’s being built as well, with developers building more condos and smaller units – appealing for investors because the purchase price is generally cheaper than a house or an apartment building. It may cause other problems too, in the long term, for the new class of buyers. With interest rates likely to rise in the near future, purchasers who shoulder a high level of debt to finance their winning bid may find that their investments cost more than they expected.</p><p>投资者的兴趣激增，为该国提供了大部分租赁单元，这推动了创纪录的房屋建设水平，并增加了对房地产的需求。但在待售房产严重短缺的情况下，新买家与潜在业主展开竞争，也在推动房价上涨。需求的增长也影响着正在建设的项目，开发商建造了更多的共管公寓和更小的单元——这对投资者来说很有吸引力，因为购买价格通常比房子或公寓楼便宜。从长远来看，这可能会给新的买家阶层带来其他问题。由于利率在不久的将来可能会上升，为中标融资而背负高额债务的买家可能会发现，他们的投资成本高于预期。</p><p> Since the turn of this century, the average home price has risen over 300 per cent. The sharpest increases have happened during the pandemic and have hit less populated cities and suburbs the hardest: The typical price of a home across the country is 46 per cent more expensive than it was two years ago.</p><p>自本世纪之交以来，平均房价已上涨逾300%。疫情期间房价上涨幅度最大，对人口较少的城市和郊区的打击最为严重：全国各地的典型房价比两年前高出46%。</p><p>  The surge in values has elevated real estate as an investment class at a time when more common ones like stocks and bonds have either proved volatile or delivered scant returns. Canada’s aging population is another factor driving investor growth: As the burden of providing for retirement has shifted from employers to individuals, Canadians are increasingly looking for investments that will generate cash when they retire and real estate is becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>在股票和债券等更常见的投资类别被证明不稳定或回报率微乎其微之际，房地产价值的飙升提升了其作为投资类别的地位。加拿大人口老龄化是推动投资者增长的另一个因素：随着养老负担从雇主转移到个人身上，加拿大人越来越多地寻找退休后能产生现金的投资，房地产也越来越受欢迎。</p><p> “There’s only really one other place to turn. I mean we’re not going to count bitcoin or venture capital as a normal investment for somebody. The only alternative is real estate,” said Mr. Sarracini, chief executive of real estate education company Keyspire Group and former TV personality on HGTV’s  Income Property. “What’s grown is the acceptance to real estate as an investment.”</p><p>房地产教育公司Keyspire Group的首席执行官、HGTV收入房产的前电视名人萨拉西尼说：“实际上，只有一个地方可以转向。我的意思是，我们不会把比特币或风险投资视为某人的正常投资。唯一的选择是房地产。”。“人们越来越接受房地产作为一种投资。”</p><p>  Part of that acceptance comes via social media. Real estate investing is ubiquitous in Canada, with homebuyers and realtors talking up the housing market on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and other platforms.</p><p>这种接受的一部分来自社交媒体。房地产投资在加拿大无处不在，购房者和房地产经纪人在Twitter、Facebook、YouTube、Instagram和其他平台上谈论房地产市场。</p><p> Businesses that support real estate investing are seeing a surge in demand. Since the pandemic started, Keyspire has seen enrolment double for its real estate investing courses. The company is currently drawing 3,000 to 5,000 new registrants from across North America every week compared with about half that volume prepandemic.</p><p>支持房地产投资的企业正看到需求激增。自疫情开始以来，Keyspire的房地产投资课程的注册人数翻了一番。该公司目前每周从北美各地吸引3000至5000名新注册者，而这一数字约为prepandemic的一半。</p><p> Real estate investing clubs are taking off. Realtors with investing businesses are being inundated with requests.</p><p>房地产投资俱乐部正在崛起。有投资业务的房地产经纪人正被大量的请求淹没。</p><p> “More and more people are seeking yield for their capital. Real estate is one of those stable assets in Canada,” said Patrick Francey, the chief executive of Real Estate Investment Network, which has been providing real estate investing courses for 30 years.</p><p>房地产投资网络（Real estate Investment Network）的首席执行官帕特里克·弗兰西（Patrick Francey）表示：“越来越多的人在寻求资本收益。房地产是加拿大最稳定的资产之一。”该公司提供房地产投资课程已有30年。</p><p> Jacqueline Francis, 41, and her partner Leo, 40, started seriously getting into real estate investing in 2020. They did it to give their three children a better life. “We want to begin to create wealth for them, give them opportunities that we haven’t had,” said Mr. Francis, who grew up in a small, roach-infested three-bedroom apartment in Toronto with his four siblings and parents.</p><p>41岁的杰奎琳·弗朗西斯（Jacqueline Francis）和40岁的伴侣利奥（Leo）于2020年开始认真投资房地产。他们这样做是为了让三个孩子过上更好的生活。“我们想开始为他们创造财富，给他们提供我们没有的机会，”弗朗西斯说。他和四个兄弟姐妹和父母在多伦多一间蟑螂出没的三居室小公寓里长大。</p><p> Before they started investing, Mr. Francis worked full time as a dump truck driver, hauling material out of construction sites. Many of the sites were residential real estate projects and his world revolved around developers and other professionals in the industry. At the same time, some of the couple’s friends and relatives were investing or becoming realtors. The Francises described real estate as being a constant presence in their lives, so they decided to give it a try and enrolled in investing courses. They decided to focus on small apartments also known as multi-residential buildings. “It’s not like get-rich-quick because it’s something that takes time,” Ms. Francis said.</p><p>在他们开始投资之前，弗朗西斯全职做自卸卡车司机，从建筑工地运出材料。许多地点都是住宅房地产项目，他的世界围绕着开发商和该行业的其他专业人士。与此同时，这对夫妇的一些朋友和亲戚正在投资或成为房地产经纪人。弗朗西斯夫妇将房地产描述为他们生活中的常客，因此他们决定尝试一下，并报名参加投资课程。他们决定把重点放在小型公寓，也称为多住宅建筑。“这不像快速致富，因为这需要时间，”弗朗西斯说。</p><p>  The couple, who live in a house in Durham, Ont., own a condo in Toronto, two multi-residential buildings in Niagara – a 16-unit building and a six-plex – and have made deposits on two preconstruction units. They are also expected to close on a 12-plex in London. They used their home equity line of credit to buy the first multi-residential property in 2020 and raised cash from friends and family to buy the smaller one in 2021.</p><p>这对夫妇住在安大略省达勒姆的一所房子里。，在多伦多拥有一套共管公寓，在尼亚加拉拥有两栋多层住宅楼——一栋16单元的建筑和一栋六层楼——并已在两套施工前单元上进行了存款。预计他们还将关闭伦敦的一个12层建筑群。他们用自己的房屋净值信用额度购买了2020的第一套多住宅物业，并从朋友和家人那里筹集现金，以购买2021的小型住宅。</p><p> The couple described feeling more financially secure and say they will soon have more freedom. They said their friends are noticing and are starting to ask about real estate investing. “They want to know what we’re doing,” Mr. Francis said. “They want to get involved.”</p><p>这对夫妇描述说，他们在经济上感到更安全，并表示他们很快就会有更多的自由。他们说他们的朋友们注意到了，并开始询问房地产投资。“他们想知道我们在做什么，”弗朗西斯说。“他们想参与进来。”</p><p> Growing demand from investors has helped provide more rental supply, but has trickle-down effects that concern affordable housing advocates.</p><p>投资者不断增长的需求帮助提供了更多的租赁供应，但也产生了涓滴效应，这让经济适用房倡导者感到担忧。</p><p> Housing specifically built for rental, also known as purpose-built rental, makes up a small percentage of the total housing units in the country. Government-funded social housing is an even smaller share.</p><p>专为出租而建造的住房，也被称为专为出租而建造的住房，只占该国住房总面积的一小部分。政府资助的社会住房所占比例更小。</p><p> New purpose-built rental units started declining in the 1990s, as developers turned to condos, and federal funding for social housing slowed. About 20 per cent of the housing starts were specifically for rental in 1990, according to CMHC data. That percentage fell as low as 6 per cent and then hovered around 10 per cent until 2015, the beginning of the previous housing boom in Toronto and Vancouver. Meanwhile, the pace of condo development ramped up, accounting for 25 per cent of the housing starts in the 1990s, expanding to 30 per cent at the turn of the century and rising to as much as 40 per cent by 2012.</p><p>20世纪90年代，随着开发商转向共管公寓，以及联邦政府对社会住房的资助放缓，新建租赁单元开始减少。根据CMHC的数据，1990年，大约20%的房屋开工是专门用于出租的。这一比例降至6%，然后徘徊在10%左右，直到2015年，多伦多和温哥华上一次房地产繁荣的开始。与此同时，共管公寓的开发速度加快，在20世纪90年代占新开工房屋的25%，在世纪之交扩大到30%，到2012年上升到40%。</p><p> “The housing system has moved away from purpose-built rental towards individual investors as a source of rental supply,” said Aled ab Iorwerth, deputy chief economist of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the federal mortgage insurer.</p><p>联邦抵押贷款保险公司加拿大抵押贷款和住房公司（Canada Mortgage and housing Corp.）副首席经济学家亚历德·阿布·伊奥沃思（Aled ab Iorwerth）表示：“住房系统已经从专门建造的租金转向个人投资者，作为租金供应的来源。”。</p><p>  The growth in investor purchasing is “absolutely shaping the market. There’s no question,” said Heather Tremain, chief executive officer of Options For Homes, a non-profit developer that provides shared-equity mortgages for low-income earners so they can own their home. “You see this tendency to be building smaller units,” she said.</p><p>非营利开发商Options For Homes的首席执行官希瑟·特雷曼（Heather Tremain）说，投资者购买量的增长“绝对影响着市场。这是毫无疑问的。”该开发商为低收入者提供共享股权抵押贷款，使他们能够拥有自己的房子。“你可以看到这种倾向，即建造更小的单元，”她说。</p><p> Last year, there was record levels of home building in Canada. Builders broke ground on 244,025 new homes, according to CMHC, nearly 60 per cent of which was apartment or condo units.</p><p>去年，加拿大的住宅建设达到了创纪录的水平。CMHC的数据显示，建筑商在244025套新房中破土动工，其中近60%是公寓或共管公寓。</p><p> Family-sized homes are becoming increasingly hard to find. So are affordable smaller units for renters, since rising prices are driving up fees. The price of a preconstruction condo in the Toronto region was $1,322 per square foot at the end of last year, according to condo research group Urbanation. That means a 550-square-foot condo costs about $730,000. If a buyer made the 20-per-cent down payment and had a mortgage rate of 3.1 per cent over 25 years, the monthly mortgage payments would run around $2,821, without factoring in  condo fees, taxes and insurance.  To cover their mortgage expenses, an investor would have to charge at least that much as monthly rent – an exorbitant amount for many would-be renters.</p><p>家庭规模的住宅越来越难找到。租房者负担得起的小型公寓也是如此，因为不断上涨的价格推高了费用。据共管公寓研究组织Urbanation的数据，去年年底，多伦多地区的一套预建共管公寓的价格为每平方英尺1322美元。这意味着一套550平方英尺的共管公寓的价格约为73万美元。如果一位买家支付了20%的首付款，并在25年内拥有3.1%的按揭利率，那么每月的按揭付款将在2821美元左右，而不考虑共管公寓费用、税收和保险。为了支付抵押贷款费用，投资者必须收取至少相当于每月租金的费用——对于许多潜在的租客来说，这是一个过高的数额。</p><p> “If you look at numbers, it is creating new housing supply but is it addressing some of the long-standing challenges within our community? No,” said Brian Doucet, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo’s school of planning, whose research includes gentrification, housing and neighbourhoods.</p><p>滑铁卢大学的规划学院副教授Brian Doucet说：“如果你看看数字，它是在创造新的住房供应，但它能解决我们社区中长期存在的一些挑战吗？不，”它的研究包括绅士化、住房和社区。</p><p> In Prof. Doucet’s community of Kitchener-Waterloo, there is extensive development along the new transit lines. There is a similar push to build more densely around transit hubs throughout Southern Ontario, the lower mainland in B.C. as well as major cities such as Edmonton. But the bulk of the new development is small housing units.</p><p>在杜塞特教授的基奇纳-滑铁卢社区，沿着新的交通线有着广泛的发展。在安大略省南部、不列颠哥伦比亚省较低的大陆以及埃德蒙顿等主要城市，也有类似的推动，围绕交通枢纽建设更密集的城市。但新开发的大部分是小型住宅单元。</p><p> Prof. Doucet said the question of what to build and for whom is really left to the private sector to build what is more profitable and when a large percentage of buyers do not intend to live in the homes, developers are filling investor demand as opposed to demand from those seeking shelter.</p><p>杜塞特教授说，建造什么以及为谁建造更有利可图的房屋的问题，真正留给私营部门来解决。当很大一部分购房者不打算住在这些房子里时，开发商正在满足投资者的需求，而不是寻求住房的人的需求。</p><p>  “Until we confront the conflicting role that housing plays in our society as both shelter and a commodity, I am not very hopeful that adding new supply will address long-standing housing challenges, particularly for those on low incomes,” he said.</p><p>他说：“在我们面对住房作为住房和商品在我们的社会中所起的相互矛盾的作用之前，我不太希望增加新的住房供应能解决长期存在的住房挑战，特别是对低收入者而言。”。</p><p> Prof. Doucet thinks governments need to take a more pro-active role in determining the type of housing that’s needed and not just the location. Ms. Tremain said some governments shape supply by requiring a range of unit sizes in a new project. But it’s tricky. Three-bedroom condos are expensive to build and can cost as much as a house, even without factoring in condo fees. “Requirements for large units need to be balanced with an understanding of the real demand and affordability for those units,” Ms. Tremain said.</p><p>杜塞特教授认为，政府需要在确定所需住房类型方面发挥更积极的作用，而不仅仅是位置。特雷曼说，一些政府通过在一个新项目中要求一系列单元大小来影响供应。但这很棘手。三居室共管公寓的建造成本很高，即使不考虑共管公寓的费用，也可能与一栋房子一样贵。“大型公寓的需求需要与对这些公寓的实际需求和可承受性的理解相平衡，”特雷曼说。</p><p> Policy-makers have struggled to quantify the investor effect and to figure out what, if anything, should be done.</p><p>政策制定者一直在努力量化投资者效应，并弄清楚应该做些什么（如果有的话）。</p><p> CMHC has repeatedly said investors are an important part of the housing market because they turn their properties into rental units and help finance new development.</p><p>CMHC一再表示，投资者是房地产市场的重要组成部分，因为他们将自己的房产变成出租单元，并帮助为新开发项目融资。</p><p> CMHC’s Mr. ab Iorwerth said investors contribute to home-buying competition but said “they may be more a symptom than a cause,” of the current housing froth.</p><p>CMHC的ab Iorwerth说，投资者对购房竞争起到了推动作用，但他说，“他们可能更多地是当前房地产泡沫的症状，而不是原因”。</p><p> Regardless, policy-makers recognize that there is a problem with Canada’s housing market. The federal government has said affordable housing is a priority. It is spending billions of dollars on refurbishing and building affordable housing and has proposed measures aimed at helping first-time homebuyers. It has zeroed in on house flippers, foreign buyers and foreign owners of empty homes to try to tamp down speculative buying. And it wants to curb investors’ “excessive profits” in investment properties though it has not defined “excessive” and has suggested it would only apply to institutional investors, not individual investors. Down payment requirements for investment properties are also under review.</p><p>无论如何，政策制定者认识到加拿大的住房市场存在问题。联邦政府表示，经济适用房是一个优先事项。它正在花费数十亿美元翻新和建造经济适用房，并提出了旨在帮助首次购房者的措施。它已将重点放在炒房者、外国买家和空置房屋的外国业主身上，试图遏制投机性购买。它还希望遏制投资者在投资性房地产上的“超额利润”，尽管它没有定义“超额利润”，并建议它只适用于机构投资者，而不是个人投资者。投资性房地产的首付款要求也在审查中。</p><p>  CMHC has warned that the housing market is overheated and at risk of a downturn. But that warning has been largely ignored. Homebuyers find it hard to believe that the Canadian real estate market could drop for a sustained period of time, especially when home prices have been on an upward trajectory for three decades. Still, if home prices do fall, investors are more vulnerable to losing their properties and life savings.</p><p>CMHC警告称，房地产市场过热，有可能出现低迷。但这一警告在很大程度上被忽视了。购房者很难相信加拿大房地产市场会持续下跌一段时间，尤其是在房价已经上升了30年的情况下。不过，如果房价真的下跌，投资者更容易失去房产和毕生积蓄。</p><p> But for now, the lure of real estate is hard to resist. Even for investors who have had a hard time renting their properties, they have still managed to walk away with a handsome profit.</p><p>但就目前而言，房地产的诱惑难以抗拒。即使对于那些在租房时遇到困难的投资者来说，他们仍然能够获得可观的利润。</p><p> Cheryl Vanditelli and her partner Robert Harris bought five houses in Niagara in 2015. Each house was under $200,000. They started buying real estate because they were worried Ms. Vanditelli would soon lose her job. At first, they had tenants but then they ran into problems. One tenant stopped paying three months after moving in. Another stopped pa­­­­­ying when the eviction moratorium went into place in the early days of the pandemic.</p><p>2015年，谢丽尔·范迪特利和她的伴侣罗伯特·哈里斯在尼亚加拉买了五套房子。每套房子不到20万美元。他们开始购买房地产，因为他们担心范迪特利很快就会失去工作。起初，他们有租户，但后来遇到了问题。一名租户在搬进来三个月后停止付款。在疫情爆发的早期，当暂停驱逐令生效时，另一个人停止了巴英。</p><p> Ms. Vanditelli said they could not afford to make their mortgage payments and pay for the upkeep of the properties without renters. Then they had a hard time finding new tenants because Niagara’s economy depends on American tourists and those tourists disappeared when the Canada-U.S. borders closed to non-essential travellers. So they sold. “It is not as easy as people think,” Ms. Vanditelli said. Still, they made a profit. She estimates that they earned $80,000 on the sale of one property, $100,000 on the second and about $100,000 on the third.</p><p>Vanditelli女士说，如果没有租客，他们无法支付抵押贷款和物业维护费用。然后，他们很难找到新的租户，因为尼亚加拉的经济依赖于美国游客，而当加拿大和美国边境对非必要的游客关闭时，这些游客消失了。所以他们卖掉了。“这并不像人们想象的那么容易，”范迪特利说。尽管如此，他们还是盈利了。她估计，他们出售一处房产赚了8万美元，第二处房产赚了10万美元，第三处房产赚了10万美元。</p><p> Ms. Vanditelli does not have any immediate plans to buy more property. But when asked if she thought it was worth it, she said: “Absolutely. You can’t put a price on your freedom.”</p><p>范迪泰利目前没有购买更多房产的计划。但当被问到是否值得时，她说：“绝对值得。你不能为你的自由付出代价。”</p><p>  Your time is valuable.
