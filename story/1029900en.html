For instance  Facebook,   certainly a social media company, received a  record $5 billion fine last year for failure to comply with rules set by the FTC. But not because the company violated its  social media regulations — there aren’t any.</p><p>现在，首先必须明确的是，这些公司绝不是“不受监管的”，因为在这个国家，没有任何合法的业务是不受监管的。例如，Facebook，当然是一家社交媒体公司，去年因未能遵守联邦贸易委员会制定的规则而收到了创纪录的50亿美元罚款。但这并不是因为该公司违反了社交媒体规定--没有任何规定。</p><p> Facebook and others are bound by the same rules that most companies must follow, such as generally agreed-upon definitions of fair business practices, truth in advertising, and so on. But industries like medicine, energy, alcohol, and automotive have additional rules, indeed entire agencies, specific to them; Not so social media companies.</p><p>Facebook和其他公司受到大多数公司必须遵守的相同规则的约束，比如对公平商业行为、广告真实性等的普遍认可的定义。但医药、能源、酒精和汽车等行业有额外的规定，甚至是整个机构，都是专门针对它们的；社交媒体公司就不是这样了。</p><p> I say “social media” rather than “tech” because the latter is much too broad a concept to have a single regulator. Although Google and Amazon (and Airbnb, and Uber, and so on) need new regulation as well, they may require a different specialist, like an algorithmic accountability office or online retail antitrust commission. (Inasmuch as tech companies act within regulated industries, such as Google in broadband, they are already regulated as such.)</p><p>我说的是“社交媒体”，而不是“科技”，因为后者是一个太宽泛的概念，不可能有一个单一的监管机构。虽然谷歌和亚马逊(以及Airbnb和优步等等)也需要新的监管，但他们可能需要不同的专家，比如算法问责办公室或在线零售反垄断委员会。(由于科技公司是在受监管的行业内行动，比如宽带领域的谷歌，它们已经受到了监管。)。</p><p> Social media can roughly defined as platforms where people sign up to communicate and share messages and media, and that’s quite broad enough already without adding in things like ad marketplaces, competition quashing and other serious issues.</p><p>社交媒体可以粗略地定义为人们签约交流和分享信息和媒体的平台，这已经足够广泛了，不包括广告市场、压制竞争和其他严重问题。</p><p> Who, then, regulates these social media companies? For the purposes of the U.S., there are four main directions from which meaningful limitations or policing may emerge, but each one has serious limitations, and none was actually created for the task.</p><p>那么，谁来监管这些社交媒体公司呢？就美国而言，有四个主要方向可能会产生有意义的限制或监管，但每个方向都有严重的限制，实际上没有一个是为这项任务而创建的。</p><p>   The Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission are what people tend to think of when “social media” and “regulation” are used in a sentence together. But one is a specialist — not the right kind, unfortunately — and the other a generalist.</p><p>当“社交媒体”和“监管”一起用在一句话里时，人们往往会想到联邦通信委员会和联邦贸易委员会。但一个是专家-不幸的是，不是正确的类型-另一个是多面手。</p><p> The  FCC,   unsurprisingly, is primarily concerned with  communication, but due to  the laws that created it and grant it authority, it has almost no authority over  what is being communicated.  The sabotage of net neutrality has complicated this somewhat, but even the faction of the Commission dedicated to the backwards stance adopted during this administration has not argued that the messages and media you post are subject to their authority. They have indeed called for regulation of social media and big tech — but are for the most part unwilling and unable to do so themselves.</p><p>不出所料，FCC主要关注通信，但由于创建它并授予它权力的法律，它几乎没有权力控制正在进行的通信。对网络中立性的破坏使这一点变得有点复杂，但即使是委员会中致力于在本届政府期间采取倒退立场的派别也没有争辩说，你发布的信息和媒体受到他们的授权。他们确实呼吁对社交媒体和大型科技进行监管，但他们自己在很大程度上不愿意也无法做到这一点。</p><p> The Commission’s mandate is explicitly the cultivation of a robust and equitable communications infrastructure, which these days primarily means fixed and mobile broadband (though increasingly satellite services as well). The applications and businesses that  use that broadband, though they may be affected by the FCC’s decisions, are generally speaking none of the agency’s business, and it has  repeatedly said so.</p><p>委员会的任务明确是培育强大和公平的通信基础设施，这在今天主要是指固定和移动宽带(尽管卫星服务也越来越多)。使用该宽带的应用程序和企业，尽管它们可能会受到FCC的决定的影响，但总的来说，它不关该机构的事，而且它一再这样说。</p><p>  The only potentially relevant exception is the much-discussed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (an amendment to the sprawling Communications Act), which waives liability for companies when illegal content is posted to their platforms, as long as those companies make a “good faith” effort to remove it in accordance with the law.</p><p>唯一可能相关的例外是备受讨论的通信正义法第230条(对庞大的通信法的修正案)，该条款免除了公司在其平台上发布非法内容时的责任，只要这些公司做出“善意”的努力，依法将其删除。</p><p> But this part of the law doesn’t actually grant the FCC authority over those companies or define good faith, and there’s an enormous risk of stepping into unconstitutional territory, because a government agency telling a company what content it must keep up or take down runs full speed into the First Amendment. That’s why although many  think Section 230 ought to be revisited, few take Trump’s feeble executive actions along these lines seriously.</p><p>但法律的这一部分实际上并没有赋予FCC对这些公司的权力或定义诚信，而且有进入违宪领域的巨大风险，因为政府机构告诉公司必须保留或删除哪些内容，这会全速进入第一修正案。这就是为什么尽管许多人认为第230条应该重新讨论，但很少有人认真对待特朗普沿着这些路线采取的软弱的行政行动。</p><p> The agency did announce that it will be reviewing the prevailing interpretation of Section 230, but until there is some kind of established statutory authority or Congress-mandated mission for the FCC to look into social media companies, it simply can’t.</p><p>该机构确实宣布，它将审查第230条的现行解释，但在FCC有某种既定的法定权力或国会授权的任务来调查社交媒体公司之前，它根本不能这样做。</p><p>  The  FTC   is a different story. As watchdog over business practices at large, it has a similar responsibility towards  Twitter   as it does towards Nabisco. It doesn’t have rules about what a social media company can or can’t do any more than it has rules about how many flavors of Cheez-It there should be. (There are industry-specific “guidelines” but these are more advisory about how general rules have been interpreted.)</p><p>联邦贸易委员会则是另一回事。作为对整个商业行为的监督机构，它对Twitter的责任与对纳贝斯科的责任相似。它没有规定一家社交媒体公司可以做什么，不能做什么，就像它没有规定Cheez应该有多少种口味一样。(有特定于行业的“指导方针”，但这些更多的是关于如何解释一般规则的建议。)。</p><p> On the other hand, the FTC is very much the force that comes into play should Facebook misrepresent how it shares user data, or Nabisco overstate the amount of real cheese in its crackers. The agency’s most relevant responsibility to the social media world is that of enforcing the truthfulness of material claims.</p><p>另一方面，如果Facebook歪曲分享用户数据的方式，或者纳比斯科夸大了饼干中真正的奶酪数量，联邦贸易委员会在很大程度上是起作用的力量。该机构与社交媒体世界最相关的责任是执行材料声明的真实性。</p><p> You can thank the FTC for the now-familiar, carefully worded statements that avoid any real claims or responsibilities: “We take security very seriously” and “we think we have the best method” and that sort of thing — so pretty much everything that Mark Zuckerberg says. Companies and executives are trained to do this to avoid tangling with the FTC: “Taking security seriously” isn’t enforceable, but saying “user data is never shared” certainly is.</p><p>你可以感谢联邦贸易委员会现在熟悉的、措辞谨慎的声明，这些声明避免了任何真正的索赔或责任：“我们非常认真地对待安全问题”，“我们认为我们拥有最好的方法”等诸如此类的东西-几乎所有马克·扎克伯格(Mark Zuckerberg)说的话都是如此。公司和高管接受过这样的培训，以避免与联邦贸易委员会纠缠：“认真对待安全问题”是不可行的，但说“用户数据永远不会共享”肯定是可行的。</p><p>  In some cases this can still have an effect, as in the $5 billion fine recently dropped into Facebook’s lap (though for many reasons that was  actually not very consequential). It’s important to understand that the fine was for breaking binding promises the company had made — not for violating some kind of social-media-specific regulations, because again, there really aren’t any.</p><p>在某些情况下，这仍然会产生影响，比如最近Facebook被处以50亿美元的罚款(尽管出于许多原因，这实际上并不是很重要)。重要的是要明白，罚款是因为违反了公司做出的有约束力的承诺-而不是因为违反了某种社交媒体特定的规定，因为再说一遍，真的没有任何规定。</p><p> The last point worth noting is that the FTC is a  reactive agency. Although it certainly has guidelines on the limits of legal behavior, it doesn’t have rules that when violated result in a statutory fine or charges. Instead, complaints filter up through its many reporting systems and it builds a case against a company, often with the help of the Justice Department. That makes it slow to respond compared with the lightning-fast tech industry, and the companies or victims involved may have moved beyond the point of crisis while a complaint is being formalized there. Equifax’s historic breach and minimal consequences are an instructive case:</p><p>最后一点值得注意的是，联邦贸易委员会是一个被动的机构。虽然它当然有关于合法行为限制的指导方针，但它没有规定一旦违反就会导致法定的罚款或指控。取而代之的是，投诉通过其许多报告系统进行过滤，并建立针对一家公司的案件，通常是在司法部的帮助下。与闪电般的科技行业相比，这使得它的反应很慢，而且当投诉正在正式确定时，涉及的公司或受害者可能已经超越了危机点。Equifax的历史性违规和最低限度的后果是一个具有启发性的案例：</p><p>  So: While the FCC and FTC do provide important guardrails for the social media industry, it would not be accurate to say they are its regulators.</p><p>因此：尽管联邦通信委员会和联邦贸易委员会确实为社交媒体行业提供了重要的护栏，但说它们是社交媒体行业的监管机构并不准确。</p><p>  States are increasingly battlegrounds for the frontiers of tech, including social media companies. This is likely due to frustration with partisan gridlock in Congress that has left serious problems unaddressed for years or decades. Two good examples of states that lost their patience are  California’s new privacy rules and Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).</p><p>各州越来越多地成为包括社交媒体公司在内的科技前沿的战场。这可能是因为国会中的党派僵局令人沮丧，多年来或数十年来，这些僵局一直没有解决严重的问题。加州新的隐私规则和伊利诺伊州的生物识别信息隐私法案(BIPA)是两个失去耐心的州的好例子。</p><p>  The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was arguably born out the ashes of other attempts at a national level to make companies more transparent about their data collection policies, like the  ill-fated Broadband Privacy Act.</p><p>加州消费者隐私法案(CCPA)可以说是在国家层面上让公司在数据收集政策上更加透明的其他尝试的灰烬中诞生的，比如命运多舛的宽带隐私法案。</p><p> Californian officials decided that if the feds weren’t going to step up, there was no reason the state shouldn’t at least look after its own. By convention, state laws that offer consumer protections are generally given priority over weaker federal laws — this is so a state isn’t prohibited from taking measures for their citizens’ safety while the slower machinery of Congress grinds along.</p><p>加州官员决定，如果联邦政府不采取行动，该州没有理由不至少照顾好自己。按照惯例，提供消费者保护的州法律通常优先于较弱的联邦法律-这是因为在国会运转缓慢的情况下，州政府不会被禁止采取措施保障公民的安全。</p><p> The resulting law, very briefly stated, creates formal requirements for disclosures of data collection, methods for opting out of them, and also grants authority for enforcing those laws. The rules may seem like common sense when  you read them, but they’re pretty far out there compared to the relative freedom tech and social media companies enjoyed previously. Unsurprisingly, they have vocally opposed the CCPA.</p><p>简而言之，由此产生的法律为数据收集的披露、选择退出的方法创造了正式要求，并授予了执行这些法律的权力。当你读到这些规则时，它们可能看起来像是常识，但与科技和社交媒体公司之前享有的相对自由相比，它们相去甚远。不出所料，他们口头上反对CCPA。</p><p> BIPA has a somewhat similar origin, in that a particularly far-sighted state legislature created a set of rules in 2008 limiting companies’ collection and use of biometric data like fingerprints and facial recognition. It has proven to be a huge thorn in the side of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others that have taken for granted the ability to analyze a user’s biological metrics and use them for pretty much whatever they want.</p><p>BIPA的起源有点类似，因为一个特别有远见的州立法机构在2008年制定了一套规则，限制公司收集和使用指纹和面部识别等生物识别数据。事实证明，这对Facebook、微软、亚马逊、谷歌和其他公司来说是一个巨大的刺痛，这些公司认为分析用户的生物指标并将其用于几乎任何他们想要的东西的能力是理所当然的。</p><p>  Many lawsuits have been filed alleging violations of BIPA, and while few have produced  notable punishments like this one, they have been invaluable in forcing the companies to admit on the record exactly what they’re doing, and how. Sometimes it’s quite surprising! The optics are terrible, and tech companies have lobbied (fortunately, with little success) to have the law replaced or weakened.</p><p>已经有许多诉讼指控违反了BIPA，虽然很少有像这样的显著处罚，但它们在迫使这些公司正式承认他们到底在做什么以及如何做方面起到了无价的作用。有时候真的很让人吃惊！光学效果很糟糕，科技公司已经游说(幸运的是，收效甚微)，要求取代或削弱这项法律。</p><p> What’s crucially important about both of these laws is that they force companies to, in essence, choose between universally meeting a new, higher standard for something like privacy, or establishing a tiered system whereby some users get more privacy than others. The thing about the latter choice is that once people learn that users in Illinois and California are getting “special treatment,” they start asking why Mainers or Puerto Ricans aren’t getting it as well.</p><p>这两部法律最重要的一点是，它们迫使公司在本质上做出选择，要么普遍满足新的、更高的隐私标准，要么建立分级系统，让一些用户获得比其他用户更多的隐私。关于后一种选择的问题是，一旦人们了解到伊利诺伊州和加利福尼亚州的用户正在享受“特殊待遇”，他们就会开始问为什么缅因州人或波多黎各人没有得到同样的待遇。</p><p> In this way state laws exert outsize influence, forcing companies to make changes nationally or globally because of decisions that technically only apply to a small subset of their users. You may think of these states as being activists (especially if their attorneys general are proactive), or simply ahead of the curve, but either way they are making their mark.</p><p>通过这种方式，州法律施加了巨大的影响，迫使公司在全国或全球范围内做出改变，因为从技术上讲，这些决定只适用于他们的一小部分用户。你可能会认为这些州是积极分子(特别是如果他们的总检察长积极主动的话)，或者只是走在了曲线的前面，但无论哪种方式，他们都在留下自己的印记。</p><p> This is not ideal, however, because taken to the extreme, it produces a patchwork of state laws created by local authorities that may conflict with one another or embody different priorities. That, at least, is the doomsday scenario predicted almost universally by companies in a position to lose out.</p><p>然而，这并不理想，因为如果走到极端，它会产生由地方当局制定的州法律拼凑而成，这些法律可能会相互冲突，或者体现不同的优先事项。至少，这是几乎所有处于输家地位的公司都预测的世界末日情景。</p><p> State laws act as a test bed for new policies, but tend to only emerge when movement at the federal level is too slow. Although they may hit the bullseye now and again, like with BIPA, it would be unwise to rely on a single state or any combination among them to miraculously produce, like so many simian legislators banging on typewriters, a comprehensive regulatory structure for social media. Unfortunately, that leads us to Congress.</p><p>州法律充当了新政策的试验台，但往往只有在联邦一级的行动太慢时才会出现。尽管他们可能会时不时地击中靶心，就像BIPA一样，但依靠一个州或它们之间的任何组合来奇迹般地创造出一个全面的社交媒体监管结构，就像这么多猿族立法者敲打打字机一样，是不明智的。不幸的是，这将我们引向国会。</p><p>   What can be said about the ineffectiveness of Congress that has not already been said, again and again? Even in the best of times few would trust these people to establish reasonable, clear rules that reflect reality. Congress simply is not the right tool for the job, because of its  stubborn and willful ignorance on almost all issues of technology and social media, its countless conflicts of interest, and its painful sluggishness — sorry, deliberation — in actually writing and passing any bills, let alone good ones.</p><p>关于国会的无效性，还有什么可以说的，而且还没有一次又一次地被说出来？即使在最好的时候，也很少有人会相信这些人会建立合理、清晰的规则来反映现实。国会根本不是这项工作的合适工具，因为它在几乎所有的技术和社交媒体问题上都顽固而刻意地无知，它无数的利益冲突，以及它在实际起草和通过任何法案(更不用说好的法案)方面令人痛苦的迟缓-抱歉，是深思熟虑的。</p><p> Companies oppose state laws like the CCPA while calling for national rules because they know that it will take forever and there’s more opportunity to get their finger in the pie before it’s baked. National rules, in addition to coming far too late, are much more likely also be watered down and riddled with loopholes by industry lobbyists. (This is indicative of the influence these companies wield over their own regulation, but it’s hardly official.)</p><p>公司反对像CCPA这样的州法律，同时呼吁制定全国性的规定，因为他们知道这将永远需要时间，而且在馅饼烘焙之前有更多的机会参与其中。国家规定，除了来得太晚之外，更有可能被行业游说者淡化并漏洞百出。(这表明了这些公司对自己的监管施加的影响，但这很难说是官方的。)。</p><p> But Congress isn’t a total loss. In moments of clarity it has established expert agencies like those in the first item, which have Congressional oversight but are otherwise independent, empowered to make rules, and kept technically — if somewhat limply — nonpartisan.</p><p>但国会并不是彻底的失利。在清晰的时刻，它建立了像第一项中的那些专家机构，这些机构受到国会的监督，但在其他方面是独立的，有权制定规则，并在技术上保持-尽管有点软弱-无党派。</p><p> Unfortunately, the question of social media regulation is too recent for Congress to have empowered a specialist agency to address it. Social media companies don’t fit neatly into any of the categories that existing specialists regulate, something that is plainly evident by the present attempt to stretch Section 230 beyond the breaking point just to put someone on the beat.</p><p>不幸的是，社交媒体监管的问题太新了，国会没有授权一个专业机构来解决它。社交媒体公司并不完全符合现有专家监管的任何类别，这一点从目前试图将第230条延伸到临界点以上只是为了让某人处于最新状态的尝试中可见一斑。</p><p> Laws at the federal level are not to be relied on for regulation of this fast-moving industry, as the current state of things shows more than adequately. And until a dedicated expert agency or something like it is formed, it’s unlikely that anything spawned on Capitol Hill will do much to hold back the Facebooks of the world.</p><p>联邦一级的法律不能依赖于对这个快速发展的行业进行监管，正如目前的情况所显示的那样。在一个专门的专家机构或类似的机构形成之前，国会山催生的任何东西都不太可能对世界上的Facebook起到很大的阻碍作用。</p><p>  Of course, however central it considers itself to be, the U.S. is only a part of a global ecosystem of various and shifting priorities, leaders, and legal systems. But in a sort of inside-out version of state laws punching above their weight, laws that affect a huge part of the world  except the U.S. can still have a major effect on how companies operate here.</p><p>当然，无论美国认为自己有多重要，它只是全球生态系统的一部分，这个生态系统由各种不断变化的优先事项、领导人和法律制度组成。但是，在某种由内而外的州法律版本中，影响到除美国以外的世界大部分地区的法律仍然可能对公司在这里的运营产生重大影响。</p><p> The most obvious example is the  General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, a set of rules, or rather augmentation of existing rules dating to 1995, that has begun to change the way some social media companies do business.</p><p>最明显的例子是“一般数据保护条例”(General Data Protection Regulations，简称GDPR)，这是一套规则，更确切地说，是对1995年以来现有规则的扩充，已经开始改变一些社交媒体公司的经营方式。</p><p> But this is only the latest step in a fantastically complex, decades-long process that must harmonize the national laws and needs of the E.U. member states in order to provide the clout it needs to  compel adherence to the international rules. Red tape seldom bothers tech companies, which rely on bottomless pockets to plow through or in-born agility to dance away.</p><p>但这只是一个极其复杂、长达数十年的过程中的最新一步，这个过程必须协调各国法律和欧盟成员国的需求，以便提供迫使其遵守国际规则所需的影响力。繁文缛节很少困扰科技公司，它们依靠无底洞的口袋来劳作，或者依靠与生俱来的敏捷性来跳舞。</p><p> Although the tortoise may eventually in this case overtake the hare in some ways, at present the  GDPR’s   primary hindrance is not merely the complexity of its rules, but the lack of decisive enforcement of them. Each country’s Data Protection Agency acts as a node in a network that must reach consensus in order to bring the hammer down,  a process that grinds slow and exceedingly fine.</p><p>虽然在这种情况下，乌龟最终可能在某些方面超过野兔，但目前GDPR的主要障碍不仅仅是规则的复杂性，而且缺乏果断的执行。每个国家的数据保护局作为网络中的一个节点，必须达成共识才能让锤子落下，这是一个缓慢而又极其精细的过程。</p><p> When the blow finally lands, though, it may be a heavy one, outlawing entire practices at an industry-wide level rather than simply extracting pecuniary penalties these immensely rich entities can shrug off. There is space for optimism as cases escalate and involve heavy hitters like antitrust laws in efforts that grow to encompass the entire “big tech” ecosystem.</p><p>不过，当这一打击最终落地时，可能会是一个沉重的打击，在全行业层面取缔整个行为，而不是简单地提取这些极其富有的实体可以不屑一顾的罚款。随着案件的升级，以及反垄断法等重量级人物参与到涵盖整个“大型科技”生态系统的努力中，我们仍有乐观的空间。</p><p>  The rich tapestry of European regulations is really too complex of a topic to address here in the detail it deserves, and also reaches beyond the question of who exactly regulates social media. Europe’s role in that question of, if you will, speaking slowly and carrying a big stick promises to produce results on a grand scale, but for the purposes of this article it cannot really be considered an effective policing body.</p><p>欧洲法规的丰富多彩实在是一个过于复杂的话题，无法在这里以应有的细节加以讨论，而且也超出了到底由谁来监管社交媒体的问题。欧洲在这个问题上扮演的角色，如果你愿意，慢条斯理，手持大棒，有望产生大规模的结果，但就本文而言，它不能真正被认为是一个有效的监管机构。</p><p>   As you can see, the regulatory ecosystem in which social media swims is more or less free of predators. The most dangerous are the small, agile ones — state legislatures — that can take a bite before the platforms have had a chance to brace for it. The other regulators are either too slow, too compromised, or too involved (or some combination of the three) to pose a real threat. For this reason it may be necessary to introduce a new, but familiar, species: the expert agency.</p><p>正如你所看到的，社交媒体所处的监管生态系统或多或少没有捕食者。最危险的是那些规模小、灵活的州立法机构，它们在平台有机会做好准备之前就可以咬一口。其他监管机构要么太慢、太妥协，要么太过介入(或者三者的某种组合)，不会构成真正的威胁。出于这个原因，可能有必要引入一个新的但熟悉的物种：专家机构。</p><p> As noted above, the FCC is the most familiar example of one of these, though its role is so fragmented that one could be forgiven for forgetting that it was originally created to ensure the integrity of the telephone and telegraph system. Why, then, is it the expert agency for orbital debris? That’s a story for another time.</p><p>如上所述，联邦通信委员会是其中一个最熟悉的例子，尽管它的作用是如此分散，人们可能会忘记它最初是为了确保电话和电报系统的完整性而创建的。那么，为什么它是轨道碎片的专家机构呢？这是另一个时间的故事。</p><p>  What is clearly needed is the establishment of an independent expert agency or commission in the U.S., at the federal level, that has statutory authority to create and enforce rules pertaining to the handling of consumer data by social media platforms.</p><p>显然需要的是在美国联邦一级建立一个独立的专家机构或委员会，该机构拥有法定权力，可以创建和执行与社交媒体平台处理消费者数据有关的规则。</p><p> Like the FCC (and somewhat like the E.U.’s DPAs), this should be officially nonpartisan — though like the FCC it will almost certainly vacillate in its allegiance — and should have specific mandates on what it can and can’t do. For instance, it would be improper and unconstitutional for such an agency to say this or that topic of speech should be disallowed from Facebook or Twitter. But it would be able to say that companies need to have a reasonable and accessible definition of the speech they forbid, and likewise a process for auditing and contesting takedowns. (The details of how such an agency would be formed and shaped is well beyond the scope of this article.)</p><p>就像FCC(有点像欧盟的DPA)一样，这应该是正式无党派的--尽管像FCC一样，它几乎肯定会在效忠上摇摆不定--并且应该对它能做什么和不能做什么有明确的授权。例如，这样的机构说这样或那样的言论主题应该被禁止在Facebook或Twitter上，这是不正当的，也是违宪的。但它可以说，公司需要对他们禁止的言论有一个合理和容易获得的定义，同样，需要有一个审计和质疑撤职的过程。(关于如何组建和塑造这样一个机构的细节远远超出了本文的范围。)。</p><p> Even the likes of the FAA lags behind industry changes, such as the upsurge in drones that necessitated a hasty revisit of existing rules, or the  huge increase in commercial space launches. But that’s a feature, not a bug. These agencies are designed not to act unilaterally based on the wisdom and experience of their leaders, but are required to perform or solicit research, consult with the public and industry alike, and create evidence-based policies involving, or at least addressing, a minimum of sufficiently objective data.</p><p>即使是像美国联邦航空局这样的机构也落后于行业变化，比如无人机的激增需要仓促地重新审视现有规则，或者商业空间发射的大幅增加。但这是一个功能，而不是一个错误。这些机构的设计不是基于其领导人的智慧和经验而单方面采取行动，而是要求它们进行或征求研究，与公众和行业进行协商，并制定涉及或至少涉及足够客观数据的循证政策。</p><p> Sure, that didn’t really work with net neutrality, but I think you’ll find that industries have been unwilling to capitalize on this temporary abdication of authority by the FCC because they see that the Commission’s current makeup is fighting a losing battle against voluminous evidence, public opinion, and common sense. They see the writing on the wall and understand that under this system it can no longer be ignored.</p><p>当然，这在网络中立方面并不奏效，但我想你会发现，各行各业都不愿利用FCC暂时放弃权力的机会，因为他们看到，委员会目前的组成正在与大量证据、舆论和常识进行一场失败的战斗。他们看到了不祥之兆，明白在这个制度下，它再也不能被忽视了。</p><p> With an analogous authority for social media, the evidence could be made public, the intentions for regulation plain, and the shareholders — that is to say, users — could make their opinions known in a public forum that isn’t owned and operated by the very companies they aim to rein in.</p><p>有了社交媒体的类似权力，证据可以公之于众，监管的意图显而易见，股东-也就是用户-可以在一个公共论坛上公布他们的观点，而这个论坛并不是由他们打算控制的公司拥有和运营的。</p><p> Without such an authority these companies and their activities — the scope of which we have only the faintest clue to — will remain in a blissful limbo, picking and choosing by which rules to abide and against which to fulminate and lobby. We must help them decide, and weigh our own priorities against theirs. They have already abused the naive trust of their users across the globe — perhaps it’s time we asked them to trust us for once.</p><p>如果没有这样的权力，这些公司及其活动-我们对这些公司的范围只有微不足道的线索-将仍然处于幸福的悬而未决的境地，挑选遵守哪些规则，以及反对哪些规则进行谴责和游说。我们必须帮助他们做出决定，并权衡我们自己的优先事项和他们的优先事项。他们已经滥用了全球用户的天真信任-也许是时候让他们信任我们一次了。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/who-regulates-social-media/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/who-regulates-social-media/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/社交/">#社交</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/social/">#social</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
