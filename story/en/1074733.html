It and the other letter are below the jump because it’s fucking  creepy in there.</p><p>这是信#322。它和另一个字母在跳转的下方，因为里面他妈的很恐怖。</p><p> Edited to Add: It’s frankly depressing that this post has struck a chord with so many people, but I’m grateful and honored to be able to help the letter writers and to have given voice to what so many people were feeling. Unfortunately the demands of moderating this discussion have become overwhelming this week, so as of Monday, August 13th comments are locked. We’ll pick up this discussion some other time. Thank you for all of your insightful contributions and for making this one of the best commentspaces on the Web. &lt;/EDIT&gt;</p><p>编辑补充：坦率地说，这篇文章引起了这么多人的共鸣，这令人沮丧，但我很感激，也很荣幸能够帮助写信人，表达这么多人的感受。不幸的是，本周要求缓和这场讨论的呼声已经达到了压倒性的程度，因此从周一开始，8月13日的评论被锁定。我们改天再讨论这个问题。感谢您的所有有见地的贡献，感谢您使这成为网络上最好的评论空间之一&lt/编辑&gt；</p><p>   We have a creeper in our social group.  He’s about 10 years older than the rest of us on average, divorced with two kids.  And I know this is going to sound like every in-denial LW who ever wrote in to an advice columnist ever, but he’s not a bad guy.  He’s fun to hang out with, he’s a devoted dad, he’s a loyal friend … and he’s driving away all of his female friends with his behavior.</p><p>我们的社交圈子里有一个爬虫。他平均比我们其他人大10岁，离过婚，有两个孩子。我知道这听起来会像是每个否认LW的人给一个建议专栏作家写过信，但他不是坏人。和他一起玩很有趣，他是一个忠诚的父亲，他是一个忠诚的朋友……他用自己的行为赶走了所有的女性朋友。</p><p> He’s mostly been concentrating on the other women: telling them to expose themselves, telling them their skirts weren’t flying high enough while they were dancing, hitting on them when he knows they have boyfriends.  (My husband tells me Creeper has also hit on me a couple times, but I haven’t noticed it.)  Most of this happens when he is drunk, but even sober he has a tendency to make sexist jokes or joke about sex and then tell us we have no sense of humor when we don’t find them funny.  A couple months ago he started complaining, loudly and repeatedly, that he really wanted to get laid because he hasn’t had sex since his divorce (about 2-3 years ago).  Whenever there are parties, it seems like he goes with the mindset that he will meet someone there that he might be able to have sex with, rather than to have fun with his friends.  A couple months ago at one of these parties, some of us went to the park after dark to hang out; Creeper approached one of my friends, asked where her boyfriend was, and when he was told that the BF was out of town he put his hands on her shoulders and told her that BF had “forfeited” her for the evening.</p><p>他主要集中在其他女人身上：告诉她们暴露自己，告诉她们跳舞时裙子飞得不够高，当他知道她们有男朋友时，他会打她们。（我丈夫告诉我，爬行动物也袭击过我几次，但我没有注意到。）这种情况大多发生在他喝醉的时候，但即使是清醒的时候，他也有开性别歧视玩笑或性玩笑的倾向，然后告诉我们，如果我们觉得这些笑话不好笑，我们就没有幽默感。几个月前，他开始反复大声抱怨说，他真的很想做爱，因为他离婚后（大约2-3年前）就没有过性生活。无论什么时候有派对，他似乎都会抱着这样的心态：他会在那里遇到一个他可能会与之发生性关系的人，而不是和他的朋友一起玩。几个月前，在其中一个派对上，我们中的一些人天黑后去公园玩；克鲁弗走近我的一个朋友，问她男朋友在哪里，当他被告知男朋友不在城里时，他把手放在她的肩膀上，告诉她男朋友“没收”了她今晚的钱。</p><p> I’ve talked to Creeper about this last incident and tried to explain that his behavior is making every woman in our social group very uncomfortable; that approaching a woman in the dark, putting his hands on her without permission, and implying that because her boyfriend wasn’t there that she was up for grabs was Not Fucking Cool; that when two of our friends got married, and he spent the entire reception hitting on the bride’s family members (including her 16-year-old cousin) he appeared to be more focused on getting laid than celebrating the marriage of two of his friends; that when he is sober, he is not so bad, but when he gets drunk he gets really creepy and maybe he should not be going to parties and getting drunk anymore.  He seemed to listen to me at the time, but now, a month later, he is whining on Facebook that people aren’t finding his sex jokes funny and calling him a creeper.  “I know I’m not a creeper, and everyone else knows, but I guess I’ve made a few faux pas with friends-of-friends” pretty much sums it up.  So clearly, nothing I said sank in.</p><p>我和爬行者谈过最后一件事，并试图解释他的行为让我们社会群体中的每个女人都感到非常不舒服；在黑暗中接近一个女人，未经允许把手放在她身上，并暗示因为她的男朋友不在那里，她就要被抓，这一点他妈的不酷；当我们的两个朋友结婚时，他把整个招待会都花在拜访新娘的家人（包括她16岁的表姐）上，他似乎更专注于做爱，而不是庆祝两个朋友的婚姻；当他清醒的时候，他并没有那么糟糕，但是当他喝醉的时候，他会变得非常可怕，也许他不应该再去参加聚会和喝醉了。当时他似乎在听我说，但一个月后的今天，他在Facebook上抱怨人们觉得他的性笑话不好笑，还说他是个爬虫。“我知道我不是一个爬虫，其他人都知道，但我猜我和朋友的朋友们犯了一些失礼的事。”这几乎是对它的总结。很明显，我说的什么都没听进去。</p><p> I want to punch him.  I’d dearly love to tell him that just because someone calls you a creeper, or creepy, doesn’t make you a bad person, but if every female friend you have is telling you that you make them uncomfortable then you are the fucking problem.  Unfortunately, he clearly isn’t listening to what I’ve been telling him (and I’m the one who hasn’t been driven off – the rest of our female friends are flat-out avoiding him for their own safety and I can’t blame them one bit for it), and I can’t tell if it’s because I’m female or if it’s because I’m 10 years younger than he is.  He also has a tendency to get defensive, and he’s starting to retreat into Nice Guy territory.  I’ve considered asking one of the other men to talk to him, but again, I’m worried he’ll dismiss whoever goes to talk to him because he’s older than the rest of us.</p><p>我想揍他。我很想告诉他，仅仅因为有人叫你毛骨悚然，或毛骨悚然，并不意味着你是个坏人，但如果你的每个女性朋友都告诉你，你让她们感到不舒服，那么你就是他妈的问题。不幸的是，他显然没有听我对他说的话（我是一个没有被赶走的人——我们其他的女性朋友为了自己的安全而全力以赴地避开他，对此我一点也不能责怪他们），我不知道是因为我是女性还是因为我比他小10岁。他也有防守的倾向，他开始撤退到好人的地盘。我曾考虑过让另一个男人和他谈谈，但我还是担心，不管谁去和他谈谈，他都会解雇，因为他比我们其他人都大。</p><p> Something needs to happen here, obviously, but I have no idea what.  He invites people over for games a lot (being one of the few people who has a table big enough for gaming), and comes over a lot as well, and the guys in the group are mostly fine hanging out with him.  (They all agree that something needs to be done about his behavior, but for them it’s not as urgent, I guess.)  He also lives a block away from me, so I see him quite a bit. I know there’s no way out of this without drama and hurt feelings and awkwardness. I just don’t know what to do.  Do I try to get the others to confront him?  Arrange some sort of intervention?  Tell my husband that Creeper’s not invited to our place anymore and avoid events where Creeper will be?  I’d call him out myself, but (1) I can’t speak for my friends, especially when they’ve been affected more than I have, (2) he clearly won’t listen to me, and (3) I’m shit at confrontation and tend to get flustered and start crying.  Any advice you have would be really helpful.</p><p>显然，这里需要发生一些事情，但我不知道会发生什么。他经常邀请人们过来玩游戏（是少数几个有足够大的桌子可以玩游戏的人之一），他也经常过来玩，团队中的人大部分都可以和他一起玩。（他们都同意需要对他的行为采取措施，但我想对他们来说，这并不是那么紧迫。）他也住在离我一个街区的地方，所以我经常见到他。我知道，如果没有戏剧性、伤感和尴尬，就没有出路。我只是不知道该怎么办。我是不是想让其他人跟他对质？安排某种干预？告诉我丈夫，爬行动物不再被邀请来我们家了，避免爬行动物会来的活动？我会自己叫他出来，但（1）我不能代表我的朋友说话，尤其是当他们受到的影响比我更大的时候，（2）他显然不听我的，以及（3）我在对抗中很糟糕，往往会慌乱并开始哭泣。你的任何建议都会很有帮助。</p><p>     My boyfriend and I have been together for over two years, and it’s been a generally great relationship. However, my boyfriend’s friend (I’ll call him Ben) has become a major sore point for us. In fact, Ben has become a major sore point for our whole group of friends. Boyfriend has been friends with Ben since middle school, and I understand that there is a lot of history there, and he feels he needs to be loyal to him. However, Ben is a gigantic creep who has preyed upon every single girl in our group.</p><p>我男朋友和我在一起已经两年多了，这段关系总体上很好。然而，我男朋友的朋友（我叫他本）成了我们的一大痛处。事实上，本已经成为我们这群朋友的一大痛处。男朋友从中学就和本是朋友，我知道那里有很多历史，他觉得他需要对他忠诚。然而，本是一个巨大的讨厌鬼，他掠夺了我们小组中的每一个女孩。</p><p> Not long after I first met Ben, we were at a party, and I got drunk/stoned and passed out. Later that night, my friend walked into the living room to find Ben cuddled up against me and stroking my leg. She freaked out at him, removed me from the living room and put me to bed, then told me what happened the next morning. She had no idea how long he’d been there, and didn’t know exactly what he did, and I was unconscious and have no memory of what happened. Needless to say, I have been very uncomfortable around him ever since. He’s also sent me weird, sexually explicit messages over facebook, and told me not to tell Boyfriend because he “wouldn’t believe [me] anyway” (Obviously, I immediately told my boyfriend, and blocked Ben not long after). Ben has also creeped on tons of other girls, including every friend I’ve brought around. Other instances of Ben’s behaviour have included:</p><p>我第一次见到本后不久，我们在一个聚会上，我喝醉了/喝醉了，昏倒了。那天晚上晚些时候，我的朋友走进客厅，发现本搂着我，抚摸着我的腿。她被他吓了一跳，把我从起居室搬出来，放我上床睡觉，然后告诉我第二天早上发生了什么。她不知道他在那里呆了多久，也不知道他到底做了什么，我也失去了知觉，不记得发生了什么。不用说，从那以后，我在他身边一直很不舒服。他还通过facebook给我发了一些奇怪的、露骨的性信息，并告诉我不要告诉男朋友，因为他“无论如何都不会相信我”（显然，我立即告诉了我的男朋友，不久之后就屏蔽了本）。本还悄悄接近了很多其他女孩，包括我带来的每一个朋友。本的其他行为包括：</p><p> Offering to drive my stranded friend home from a party, then informing her that he expected sex as “payment” when he dropped her off; following her to the house after she said no</p><p>提议开车送我的朋友从派对上回家，然后在送她下车时告诉她，他希望性是一种“报酬”；在她说“不”后跟着她去了家</p><p>  Texting my friend about how he’s “jerking off” while thinking about her</p><p>给我朋友发短信说他在想着她时是如何“抽搐”的</p><p> Straight-up fondling (fully awake and conscious) girls that he’s just met, or at the very least getting uncomfortably touchy-feely with them</p><p>直接抚摸（完全清醒和有意识地）他刚遇到的女孩，或者至少和她们在一起时会感到不舒服</p><p> Attempting to have sex with his friend’s girlfriend, on more than one occasion</p><p>不止一次试图与朋友的女友发生性关系</p><p> For what should be obvious reasons, every single girl in our group of friends completely hates Ben, and none of us want him around. However, when I tried to bring up the subject with Boyfriend and our guy friends, none of them seemed willing to admit that his behaviour was predatory or threatening, and they seemed reluctant to take a strong stance against him. They never spoke to Ben about his behaviour; in fact, they treated him as if he was a fragile child who was unable to deal with the consequences of his own actions. They also continued to include him in our activities. I was angered and baffled, and tried talking to my boyfriend about it. Boyfriend got weirdly defensive when I brought up the subject, saying that Ben is a “great guy to hang out with”, and sarcastically asking me if I wanted him to “go to Ben’s house and beat him up over something that happened a year and a half ago.” So yeah, it wasn’t a very productive conversation.</p><p>出于显而易见的原因，我们这群朋友中的每个女孩都非常讨厌本，我们都不想让他在身边。然而，当我试图向男朋友和我们的男朋友提起这个话题时，他们似乎都不愿意承认他的行为具有掠夺性或威胁性，而且他们似乎不愿意对他采取强硬立场。他们从未和本谈起过他的行为；事实上，他们对待他就像对待一个脆弱的孩子，无法应对自己行为的后果。他们还继续让他参与我们的活动。我感到愤怒和困惑，并试图与我的男朋友谈论此事。当我提起这个话题时，男朋友表现出了奇怪的防御性，他说本是一个“很好相处的人”，并讽刺地问我是否想让他“去本的家，因为一年半前发生的事情打他”是的，这不是一次很有成效的谈话。</p><p> I later found out from another friend (she is the same age as Boyfriend and Ben, and went to high school with both of them) that Ben was exactly the same way back then, and there was an instance where Boyfriend had attempted to call Ben out on his behaviour. Apparently, Ben had some sort of frightening breakdown where he went on about how he’s such a horrible person, and threatened to hurt himself, or commit suicide, or something along those lines. After being told this, I started to understand why Boyfriend and everyone else had been treating Ben as if he were so “fragile”, but hearing that story made me even more angry. It became clear to me that Ben has been emotionally manipulating my boyfriend, and probably others, so he can continue his horrible behaviour without being called out.</p><p>后来我从另一个朋友那里得知（她和男朋友和本同龄，并和他们一起上了高中），本当时的情况完全一样，有一次男朋友试图对本的行为进行谴责。显然，本得了某种可怕的精神崩溃，他继续说自己是一个多么可怕的人，威胁要伤害自己，或者自杀，或者类似的事情。在被告知这一点后，我开始理解为什么男朋友和其他人一直把本当成“脆弱的人”，但听到这个故事让我更加愤怒。我很清楚，本一直在情绪上操纵我的男朋友，可能还有其他人，这样他就可以继续他的可怕行为而不被叫醒。</p><p> I’ve stopped inviting friends to parties because I don’t want to subject them to Ben’s creepiness, and I spend most of my time trying to avoid him when he’s around. I don’t want to be one of those girls who tries to tell their boyfriend who he can and can’t hang out with, but I feel unsafe and afraid around Ben. I also feel completely betrayed that my boyfriend isn’t taking a strong stance against a guy who, let’s face it, tried to sexually assault me. I don’t want him to go “beat him up”, obviously, but it would be great if my boyfriend didn’t, y’know, constantly excuse and defend this jerk. So I guess my question is, how can I approach this subject with my boyfriend, and make him understand a) how serious this is, and b) that he is not responsible for Ben’s reactions, without making him feel defensive?</p><p>我已经停止邀请朋友参加聚会，因为我不想让他们受到本的恐惧，我大部分时间都在试图避开他。我不想成为那种试图告诉男朋友谁可以和谁不可以一起出去玩的女孩，但在本身边我感到不安全和害怕。我也觉得我的男朋友没有对一个试图性侵犯我的男人采取强硬立场，这让我感到完全被背叛了。很明显，我不想让他去“揍他”，但如果我男朋友不，你知道，经常原谅和辩护这个混蛋，那就太好了。所以我想我的问题是，我怎样才能和我的男朋友探讨这个话题，让他明白a）这有多严重，b）他不对本的反应负责，而不让他感到防御性？</p><p>    I’m not  slithering around on the floor and hissing with my forked tongue when I say that the situations described in these two letters are pretty good examples of what Rape Culture is and why it is so insidious.</p><p>当我说这两封信中描述的情况很好地说明了强奸文化是什么，以及为什么它如此阴险时，我并不是在地板上溜达，用分叉的舌头发出嘶嘶声。</p><p>   Step 3: It gets written off as “not a big deal” or “he probably didn’t mean it” or “he’s not a bad guy, really.” Any discussion of the bad behavior must immediately be followed by a complete audit of his better qualities or  the sad things he’s suffered in the name of “fairness.” Once the camera has moved in and seen him in closeup as a real, human, suffering person, how can you (the object, always an object, as in “objectified,” as in a disembodied set of tits or orifices, or a Trapper Keeper, or a favorite coffee mug or a pet cat) be so cruel as to want to hold him accountable for his actions?  Bitches, man.</p><p>第三步：它会被注销为“没什么大不了”或“他可能不是故意的”或“他不是坏人，真的。”任何关于不良行为的讨论都必须立即以“公平”的名义对他更好的品质或他所遭受的不幸进行全面审核一旦镜头移入镜头，在特写镜头中看到他是一个真实的、人类的、痛苦的人，你怎么能如此残忍地想让他为自己的行为负责（在“客观化”中，这个对象始终是一个对象，比如在一组没有实体的乳头或小孔中，或者一个捕猎者，或者一个最喜欢的咖啡杯或一只宠物猫）？婊子，伙计。</p><p> Step 4: Everyone is worried about hurting creepy dude’s feelings or making it weird for creepy dude. Better yet, everyone is worried about how the other dudes in the friend group will feel if they are called out for enabling creepy dude. Women are worried that if they push the issue, that the entire friend group will side with creepy dude or that they’ll be blamed for causing “drama.”  Look at how LW #323 put it:  “ how can I approach this subject with my boyfriend, and make him understand a) how serious this is, and b) that he is not responsible for Ben’s reactions,  without making him feel defensive?”</p><p>第四步：每个人都担心会伤害毛骨悚然的家伙的感情，或者让毛骨悚然的家伙觉得奇怪。更妙的是，每个人都担心，如果朋友组中的其他人被要求启用“令人毛骨悚然的家伙”，他们会有什么感觉。女人们担心，如果她们推动这一问题，整个朋友团体会站在“令人毛骨悚然的家伙”一边，或者她们会因为引起“戏剧性”而受到指责看看LW#323是怎么说的：“我怎样才能和我的男朋友探讨这个问题，让他明白a）这有多严重，b）他对本的反应不负责任，同时又不让他感到防御？”</p><p> Wouldn’t want someone who covers up for and defends a proto-rapist to have to have SADFEELS, right? (LW, it’s not your fault you’re asking the question this way, it’s just that our culture sucks about this and your boyfriend and his friends have been giving you constant messages that Ben is to be coddled while you are to be shushed in the hopes that it will all blow over).</p><p>我不想让一个为原始强奸犯掩饰和辩护的人有性欲，对吧？（LW，你这样问问题不是你的错，只是我们的文化很糟糕，你的男朋友和他的朋友一直在给你不断的信息，本应该被溺爱，而你应该被呵护，希望一切都会过去）。</p><p> Step 5: Creepy dude creeps on with his creepy self. He’s learned that there are no real (i.e. “disapproval &amp; pushback from dudes and dude society”) consequences to his actions. Women feel creeped out and unsafe.Some of them decide to take a firm stand against creeping and not come to parties anymore. They slowly slide out of the friend group. Some of the woman decide to just quietly put up with it, because they’ve learned that no one will really side with them and it’s easier to go along than to lose one’s entire community. The whole group works around this  missing stair.</p><p>第五步：令人毛骨悚然的家伙继续他的令人毛骨悚然的自我。他明白了自己的行为不会产生真正的后果（即“来自花花公子和花花公子社会的反对和抵制”）。女人们觉得自己被吓跑了，不安全。他们中的一些人决定采取坚定的立场反对爬行，不再参加聚会。他们慢慢地退出了朋友组。有些女性决定默默地忍受，因为她们知道没有人会真正站在她们一边，而且与失去整个社区相比，继续下去更容易。整个团队围绕着这个缺失的楼梯工作。</p><p> Possible Step 6: Creepy dude rapes someone. If he does, there’s  a less than 50% chance that the woman will report it. Why?</p><p>可能的第六步：令人毛骨悚然的家伙强奸某人。如果他这样做了，女性举报的可能性不到50%。为什么？</p><p> Could it be that all the people who surround her have taught her that if she speaks up nothing will really come of it anyway? Could it be that she doesn’t trust her friends and the people who love her to have her back on this? I CAN’T IMAGINE WHY. They couldn’t even kick this dude off their weekly trivia team.</p><p>是不是所有围着她的人都教会了她，如果她开口说话，无论如何都不会有什么结果？是不是因为她不相信她的朋友和爱她的人会支持她？我无法想象为什么。他们甚至不能把这家伙踢出他们每周的琐事小组。</p><p> Could it be that the authorities, the police, and the court system will treat her like this is something she caused to happen? Worse, will the dude’s history of being creepy come up and, instead of being used as evidence of a pattern of behavior, be used as evidence that the victim tolerated his advances in the past?</p><p>难道当局、警察和法院系统会把她当成是她导致的事情吗？更糟糕的是，这家伙的恐怖史会不会出现，而不是被用作行为模式的证据，而是被用作受害者容忍他过去的进步的证据？</p><p> So, yeah, I wanted to be very clear that these letters are part of a larger cultural paradigm that is a direct outgrowth of male privilege. Can women be creepy? Yes, for sure. They are human and capable of anything that humans are capable of. But when they are creepy, they don’t have an entire culture backing them up and explaining why their creepiness isn’t that bad.</p><p>所以，是的，我想非常清楚，这些信件是更大的文化范式的一部分，是男性特权的直接产物。女人会令人毛骨悚然吗？当然可以。他们是人，能做任何人类能做的事。但当他们令人毛骨悚然时，他们并没有一个完整的文化来支持他们，并解释为什么他们的毛骨悚然没有那么糟糕。</p><p>  LW #322, I’ll start with your Creeper, The Creepicus Complainicus, of the genus “Saddest Panda.” His cry is “ Why won’t someone just touch my wiener?” People write him off as harmless because he’s just so sad. They figure that this post-divorce pity party will eventually pass, and that he’ll stop looking at every social gathering as a place where he can bitterly fail to get laid and bitterly whine about it.</p><p>LW#322，我先从你的爬行动物“最悲伤的熊猫”属的扁平爬行动物开始他的哭喊是：“为什么有人不碰我的香肠？”人们认为他是无害的，因为他太伤心了。他们认为，这场离婚后的同情派对最终会过去，他将不再把每一次社交聚会视为一个他可以痛不欲生地不做爱、痛不欲生地抱怨的地方。</p><p> When I moved to Chicago, there were a few of these in my fledgling social group. One in particular was touchy-feely and huggy and came across as a big harmless teddy bear. He would develop a crush on every new girl in the group and constantly compliment her with weird, cutesy babytalk. Worse was the touching – hugs that last a little too long, uninvited backrubs, petting your hair, sitting down next to you and wanting to snuggle. It was all portrayed as innocent and sweet, but you could feel the boner behind it.</p><p>当我搬到芝加哥时，在我刚刚起步的社交圈子里有一些这样的人。其中一个特别性感，身材魁梧，给人的印象是一只无害的大泰迪熊。他会迷恋团队中的每一个新女孩，并不断用怪异、可爱的童言赞美她。更糟糕的是，拥抱持续时间有点太长，不请自来的背部按摩，抚摸你的头发，坐在你旁边，想要依偎。这一切都被描绘成天真和甜蜜，但你能感觉到背后的疯狂。</p><p> I was new in town and not close to people yet, so I didn’t have anyone to really talk to about this and I didn’t know how to formulate a group solution. Other women seemed to tolerate the behavior and even enjoy it, so I decided that it was probably just me. I handled it by saying some variant of “ Hey, you’re making me wicked uncomfortable. I don’t like to be touched, so don’t touch me unless I touch you first. Also, I don’t want to flirt with you, so please no compliments or cutesy stuff around me, ok? I’m not into it.” It was awkward as hell, and his feelings were super-hurt, and I felt guilty and second-guessed myself a lot, and at least one person tried to explain to me that he wasn’t that bad and I didn’t need to be such a bitch about it. “Bitch Who Doesn’t Like To Be Touched” became my persona and my armor in dealing with him and with some of the other handsy fellas (like the one who “complimented” me by telling me he masturbated about me sometimes)  in the friend group. They knew that any attempt to flirt would probably end with me saying “Gross,” in the rudest possible tone and walking away.</p><p>我是新来的，还没有和人亲近，所以我没有任何人可以真正谈论这件事，我也不知道如何制定一个集体解决方案。其他女性似乎容忍这种行为，甚至喜欢这种行为，所以我决定，可能只有我一个人。我通过说“嘿，你让我很不舒服。我不喜欢被碰，所以除非我先碰你，否则不要碰我。另外，我不想和你调情，所以请不要在我周围恭维或可爱的东西，好吗？我不喜欢。”这真是太尴尬了，他的感情受到了极大的伤害，我感到内疚，并对自己进行了很多事后猜测，至少有一个人试图向我解释他没那么坏，我也不需要为此如此恶毒。“不喜欢被触碰的婊子”成了我和他以及朋友群中其他一些帅哥打交道时的角色和盔甲（比如那个“赞美”我，告诉我他有时会手淫的家伙）。他们知道，任何调情的尝试都可能以我用最粗鲁的语气说“恶心”而告终，然后走开。</p><p> Which is not a magic solution by any means. The difference between that guy and your Creeper is that when he was called out and told directly to stop the behavior, he did. He apologized and kept his hands to himself. And over time he got more confidence and pulled himself out of his Sad Panda period, got a better job, found a specific #1 awesome lady (rather than spreading his love among All Geeky Ladies, Everywhere) and chilled the hell out. His many, many fine qualities like loyalty and smarts and a wicked sense of humor were much easier to appreciate then.  If he hadn’t backed off me? And if my decision to be “ Hi, I’m Jennifer-Please-Don’t-Touch-Me” had backfired? Saying goodbye to that social group would have been really, really hard and really, really sad and my life would be much poorer for it. None of this is easy.</p><p>这绝对不是一个神奇的解决方案。那家伙和你的爬行动物的区别在于，当他被叫出去并被直接告知停止这种行为时，他做到了。他道了歉，双手不放。随着时间的推移，他变得更加自信，摆脱了悲伤的熊猫期，找到了一份更好的工作，找到了一位特别的#1真棒的女士（而不是在所有极客女士中传播他的爱，无论在哪里），并冷静下来。他的许多优秀品质，比如忠诚、聪明和邪恶的幽默感，在当时更容易被欣赏。如果他没有放弃我？如果我决定“嗨，我是詹妮弗，请不要碰我”的决定适得其反？和那个社会群体说再见真的很难，真的很难过，我的生活会因此变得更穷。所有这些都不容易。</p><p> As far as concrete steps go, I think you’ve done all the right things all the   best reviews to you, congratulations. You’ve tried talking directly to the Creeper. Instead of listening to you and backing off, he’s decided to whine about it and treat it as something that the world has done to him instead of something brought on by his own behavior. That was his choice and not something you can control with being awesome and using your words. ( Note: The other Saddest Pandas were eventually phased out of the social group not for treating every event like a chance to get laid, but for the endless whining. Whining about their singleness. Whining about how no one appreciates their favor-sharking behavior. Whining about how they weren’t invited to certain events.  People will tolerate a fair amount of unwanted come-ons and sexual comments, but they will eventually cut you out if you won’t stop whining).</p><p>就具体步骤而言，我认为你做了所有正确的事情——所有最好的评论，祝贺你。你试过直接和爬虫说话。他没有听你的话，也没有退缩，而是决定发牢骚，把它当作世界对他的所作所为，而不是他自己的行为所带来的后果。这是他的选择，而不是你可以通过表现出色和使用你的语言来控制的事情。（注：其他最悲伤的大熊猫最终被淘汰出了社会群体，不是因为它们把每一个活动都当成了做爱的机会，而是因为它们没完没了的抱怨。抱怨它们的单身。抱怨没有人欣赏它们讨人喜欢的行为。抱怨它们没有被邀请参加某些活动。人们会容忍相当多的不必要的攻击和性评论，但如果你不停止抱怨，它们最终会把你排除在外）。</p><p> So. I think it’s time to have nothing to do with this dude. You can’t control what everyone will do – obviously he has been much-discussed if other ladies are avoiding him and you are pretty much the last one. De-friend him/hide his feed on Facebook. Do not go to any events at his house. Do not invite him to anything at yours. Make this very, very clear to your partner.</p><p>所以我想是时候和这家伙无关了。你无法控制每个人都会做什么——显然，如果其他女士都在回避他，而你几乎是最后一个，他已经被讨论了很多。在Facebook上删除他的好友/隐藏他的订阅源。不要去他家参加任何活动。不要邀请他参加你家的任何活动。让你的伴侣非常非常清楚。</p><p>  “Listen. I need to be done with Creeper for a good while. I’m not going to things at his house, and he is definitely not invited to our place.</p><p>“听着，我需要和爬行动物好好相处一段时间。我不会去他家，他肯定不会被邀请来我们家。”。</p><p> I know you like him and are hopeful that he’ll change. I hope he does, too, but being around him makes me feel so angry and unsafe that I can’t really hang around and hope it gets better.</p><p>我知道你喜欢他，希望他会改变。我也希望他能这样做，但和他在一起让我感到愤怒和不安全，我真的无法在周围闲逛，希望情况会好转。</p><p> I don’t want to tell you how to handle your relationship with him, but there are two things I need from you.</p><p>我不想告诉你如何处理你和他的关系，但我需要你做两件事。</p><p> 1) Back me up on not inviting him anywhere I will be and definitely not inviting him here.</p><p>1） 支持我不邀请他去任何我想去的地方，也绝对不邀请他来这里。</p><p> 2) When it comes up in the friend group with other guys, have my back. Don’t make me the bitch, make me someone who brought up legitimate concerns with a friend and then who got blown off. I didn’t do this to him – he CHOSE to act like a dick and then whine about it.</p><p>2） 当我和其他人在朋友小组里遇到这种事时，请支持我。别把我当成婊子，让我成为一个向朋友提出合理担忧然后被解雇的人。我没有这样对他——他选择了像个混蛋一样，然后抱怨。</p><p> If a year from now he’s drinking less and has chilled out and apologized for past behavior, I would *consider* hanging out again. But right now this decision feels pretty final.”</p><p>如果一年后他喝酒少了，而且已经冷静下来，并为过去的行为道歉，我会考虑再出去玩一次。但现在这个决定似乎是最后的决定。"</p><p> And don’t worry so much about smoothing everything over and making everyone feel okay. Deliver that script and let your partner feel how he feels about it. Probably he’ll feel bad and weird. The Creeper will feel bad and weird. They SHOULD feel bad and weird, because shit is bad and weird. Women are so socialized and trained to absorb other people’s badness and weirdness for them, that it’s going to be actively hard for you to NOT smooth things over. But don’t smooth things over. Let them be weird. Let them be AWFUL.</p><p>不要太担心让一切都变得平顺，让每个人都感觉良好。传达剧本，让你的伴侣感受他的感受。也许他会觉得不舒服和奇怪。爬行动物会感觉不好和奇怪。他们应该感到不好和奇怪，因为大便是不好和奇怪的。女人是如此的社会化和训练，以至于你很难不去抚平别人的不好和古怪。但不要把事情平复。让他们变得怪异吧。让它们变得可怕吧。</p><p>  “ Yeah, this is really awkward. I would love to feel safe and comfortable hanging out with you again, but I told you what you needed to do to make it right and you ignored me and then whined about it. So until there is a real apology and some big, observable changes in your behavior, we are on a break.”</p><p>“是的，这真的很尴尬。我很想再次和你在一起时感到安全和舒适，但我告诉了你需要做些什么来纠正它，而你却无视我，然后抱怨。所以，在你的行为发生真正的道歉和一些明显的大变化之前，我们是在休息。”</p><p> This isn’t something you did to the Creeper, it’s something that he did to himself by acting badly and then not accepting the sweet gift of possible self-awareness that you tried to deliver. It’s not innocent, it’s not harmless, it’s not “shy dude nerdy cluelessness.” That’s especially hard to claim after you tell someone directly what they’re doing wrong and ask them to knock off specific behaviors, right? And yet…every goddamn time it comes up that maybe it’s not his fault because he just didn’t know better. NO. GET THE CLUE, ALREADY.</p><p>这不是你对爬行动物做的事情，而是他对自己做的事情，表现糟糕，然后不接受你试图传递的可能自我意识的甜蜜礼物。这不是无辜的，也不是无害的，也不是“害羞的书呆子无俱乐部”在你直接告诉别人他们做错了什么并要求他们停止特定行为后，这一点尤其难以断言，对吗？然而，每一次他妈的出现，也许这不是他的错，因为他只是不知道更好。不，已经找到线索了。</p><p>  Your boyfriend’s friend Ben is pretty much going to rape someone if he hasn’t already.</p><p>你男朋友的朋友本几乎要强奸一个人，如果他还没有。</p><p> I would put the chances that he has already raped someone as high.  Very high. Someone, somewhere back in college was a little too drunk to wake up in time or to fully enforce a “ I appreciate the ride home, but please don’t come into my h</p><p>我认为他强奸别人的可能性也很高。非常高。有人，在大学里的某个地方，喝得有点醉了，没法及时醒来，也没法完全执行“我很感激你送我回家，但请不要进入我的房间。”</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/格拉斯/">#格拉斯</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/doctor/">#doctor</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/朋友/">#朋友</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
