They vowed that, starting January 1, 2021, Deere and other tractor manufacturers would make repair tools, software, and diagnostics available to the masses.</p><p>2018年9月，代表约翰·迪尔（John Deere）和其他一系列拖拉机和农用设备制造商的贸易组织做出了承诺，旨在避免来自客户的压力越来越大，并防止立法者通过他们认为繁重的维修法规。他们发誓，从2021年1月1日开始，迪尔（Deere）和其他拖拉机制造商将向大众提供维修工具，软件和诊断程序。</p><p>  This &#34; statement of principles,&#34; as it was called at the time, was nominally designed to address concerns from farmers that their tractors were becoming increasingly unrepairable due to pervasive software-based locks that artificially prevented them from fixing their equipment. As Motherboard  repeatedly reported at the time, farmers were being forced to go to &#34;authorized&#34; John Deere dealerships and service centers to perform otherwise simple repairs that they could no longer do because they were locked out of their equipment and needed special software to unlock it. To get around this, some farmers had  begun hacking their tractors with cracked software from Ukraine.</p><p>  这个＆＃34;原则声明，＆＃34;正如当时所称，它的设计旨在解决农民的担忧，即由于普遍使用基于软件的锁而导致他们的拖拉机变得越来越无法维修，这些锁人为地阻止了他们固定设备。正如母板当时反复报道的那样，农民被迫去了“授权”。约翰迪尔（John Deere）的经销店和服务中心执行原本无法进行的简单维修，因为他们被锁定在设备之外，并且需要专用软件才能对其进行解锁。为了解决这个问题，一些农民已经开始使用来自乌克兰的破解软件来入侵拖拉机。</p><p>  A host of states were considering &#34;right to repair&#34; legislation that would have compelled Deere and other manufacturers to abandon these artificial software locks, to make repair tools and guides available to the general public, and to, broadly speaking, allow farmers to fix the tractors they owned.</p><p>  许多州都在考虑“维修权”。迫使迪尔公司和其他制造商放弃这些人造软件锁，向公众提供维修工具和指南的法律，从广义上讲，允许农民修理他们拥有的拖拉机。</p><p>  Deere, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (the lobbying group that represents Deere and several other large manufacturers), and the Equipment Dealers Association announced this &#34;commitment&#34; to farmers in order to prevent any of this legislation from passing; the thinking was that if manufacturers like Deere provided some of the things that right to repair legislation would have required, they could explain to lawmakers that these bills (which provided more consumer control) weren&#39;t actually necessary.</p><p>  迪尔（Deere），设备制造商协会（代表迪尔（Deere）和其他几家大型制造商的游说团体）和设备经销商协会（ATM）宣布了这项“承诺”。为了防止该立法的任何通过而向农民；当时的想法是，如果像Deere这样的制造商提供某些需要修理权的法律，他们可以向立法者解释，这些账单（提供了更多的消费者控制权）实际上并不是必需的。</p><p>  This was a big deal in the farm world. In California, The Far West Equipment Dealers Association (which represents authorized dealers in seven western states) signed a &#34;Memorandum of Understanding&#34; with the California Farm Bureau that  enshrined this statement of principles, printed out a giant poster of it, and then  displayed it in a signing ceremony and photo-op. It was seen as a grand compromise, and farmers were the winners.</p><p>  这在农场世界中意义非凡。在加利福尼亚州，远西设备经销商协会（代表西方七个州的授权经销商）签署了“谅解备忘录”。加利福尼亚农垦局（California Farm Bureau）奉行了这一原则声明，印制了一张巨型海报，然后在签字仪式和合影中展示。这被认为是一个巨大的妥协，农民是赢家。</p><p>  “This agreement says a lot about the relationship between dealers and their customers,” Far West Equipment Dealers Association president and CEO Joani Woelfel said in a 2018  press release. “It is especially important because whenever we can resolve issues that concern us without passing laws, everybody wins.&#34;</p><p>  “这项协议充分说明了经销商与其客户之间的关系，” Far West设备经销商协会主席兼首席执行官Joani Woelfel在2018年的新闻稿中说。 “这一点尤其重要，因为只要我们能够在不通过法律的情况下解决与我们有关的问题，每个人都会获胜。”</p><p>  It is now three years later. The agreement is supposed to be in effect. No right to repair legislation has been passed. Deere, the dealers, and the manufacturers got what they wanted. And, yet, farmers are still struggling to get anything promised in the agreement.</p><p>  现在是三年后。该协议本应生效。没有通过维修法律的权利。迪尔，经销商和制造商得到了他们想要的。而且，农民仍在努力达成协议中承诺的任何内容。 </p><p>  &#34;Right now, the situation is quite bad,&#34; Nathan Proctor, the campaign director of Right to Repair at U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit consumer advocate group working on right to repair issues, told Motherboard. &#34;Three years ago, John Deere offered a half measure that was going to take three years to implement. It seemed like a stall tactic at the time. But there was some wait-and-see going on in the farm world. We’ve waited and now we see—it’s not just a half measure, it&#39;s Kabuki Theatre. You can&#39;t get it.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;目前情况非常糟糕，＆＃34;致力于修复权问题的非营利性消费者权益组织美国PIRG的“修复权”运动主管内森·普罗克特（Nathan Proctor）告诉主板。 ＆＃34;三年前，约翰·迪尔（John Deere）提出了一项需要三年才能实施的措施。当时似乎是一种失速战术。但是，在农场世界中有些观望之情。我们已经等待了，现在我们看到了-它不仅仅是歌舞uki剧院的一半。你不能得到它。</p><p>  U.S. PIRG Right to Repair advocate Kevin O&#39;Reilly  published a report Thursday that claims dealers and manufacturers have not held up their end of the bargain, and that it is still extremely difficult, if not impossible, for farmers to get diagnostic software, tools, or parts from dealers as was promised. Posing as a customer, O&#39;Reilly called 12 John Deere dealerships in six states: &#34;Of those, 11 told me that they don&#39;t sell diagnostic software and the last one gave me an email of someone to ask for the tools. I sent an email two days ago and haven&#39;t heard anything back.&#34; Motherboard called nine dealerships in seven states and was told by representatives there that the things promised by manufacturers are not available. We tried three in California; two said no immediately, a third offered to help. &#34;We don&#39;t sell those parts to the public,&#34; one said. &#34;You have to be a licensed dealer, we&#39;re not allowed to sell them to anyone,&#34; another said.</p><p>  美国PIRG维修权倡导者凯文·奥利（Kevin O＆Reilly）周四发表了一份报告，声称经销商和制造商并未阻止其讨价还价，而且农民获得诊断软件仍然非常困难，即使不是不可能，工具或经销商承诺的零件。作为客户，O＆Reilly打电话给六个州的12家John Deere经销商：其中11家告诉我他们不销售诊断软件，最后一个给我发了一封电子邮件给我索要工具。两天前，我发送了一封电子邮件，但没有收到任何回音。主板在七个州召集了九家经销店，并在那里被代表告知，制造商承诺的东西不可用。我们在加利福尼亚尝试了三个；两个立即拒绝，第三个提供帮助。我们不会将这些零件出售给公众，一说。 ＆＃34;您必须是持牌经销商，我们不允许将其出售给任何人，＆＃34;另一个说。</p><p>   Kerry Sheehan, iFixit&#39;s head of US policy, points out that currently, the &#34;only John Deere repair tools we can find&#34; are  these children&#39;s toys.</p><p>   iFixit美国政策主管Kerry Sheehan指出，目前，我们只能找到只有John Deere的维修工具。这些是儿童玩具。</p><p>  David Ward, a spokesperson for the AEM, the manufacturers&#39; lobbying and trade group that often represents John Deere, told Motherboard that &#34;Equipment manufacturers support farmers right to repair their equipment. Comprehensive repair and diagnostic information is now available for the vast majority of the tractor and combine market through authorized dealers. While we do not track it, specific information on pricing varies based on manufacturer.” A follow-up email from Motherboard that asked if he could point to a single instance where this is actually the case, or a single manufacturer that explains to farmers where they can get this information or these tools, was unreturned.</p><p>  制造商AEM的发言人David Ward经常代表约翰·迪尔（John Deere）进行的游说和贸易小组告诉母板，设备制造商支持农民维修设备的权利。现在，可通过授权经销商为绝大多数拖拉机和联合收割机市场提供全面的维修和诊断信息。虽然我们没有对其进行跟踪，但具体的定价信息因制造商而异。”未收到来自主板的后续电子邮件，询问他是否可以指出实际情况是单个实例，还是向农民解释可以从中获取此信息或这些工具的单个制造商。</p><p>  John Deere did not respond to a request for comment. But John Deere customer support manager Aaron Vancil insisted at a meeting about right to repair with the  Florida Farm Bureau last week that much of this information is readily available, according to a recording obtained by Motherboard.</p><p>  约翰迪尔（John Deere）没有回应置评请求。但是，根据母板获得的记录，约翰迪尔（John Deere）客户支持经理Aaron Vancil上周在与佛罗里达农场局（Florida Farm Bureau）举行的一次有关维修权的会议上坚持认为，这些信息中的许多都是现成的。</p><p>  “Many of these manufactures, ourselves included, we provide diagnostic tools, repair manuals, parts. Diagnostic and repair information for you, the producer has always been around, you&#39;ve always had parts, you&#39;ve always been able to get manuals, paper and such,” he said. “You have the right to repair your own equipment.”</p><p>  “许多制造商（包括我们自己在内）都提供诊断工具，维修手册和零件。为您提供诊断和维修信息，生产商一直在身边，您一直都有零件，您总是能够获得手册，纸张等，”他说。 “您有权维修自己的设备。”</p><p>  New sensors and software in tractors have led to this problem. For decades, many farmers did their own repairs. By-and-large, they can no longer do this: the proliferation of onboard computers and fancy equipment in newer models of tractors and combine harvesters has made it hard for farmers to repair the tools they need to keep the country fed.</p><p>  拖拉机中的新传感器和软件导致了此问题。几十年来，许多农民自己修理。总的来说，他们不能再这样做了：新型拖拉机和联合收割机中的车载计算机和高档设备的激增，使农民难以维修他们所需的工具，以维持该国​​的粮食。 </p><p>  “Farm equipment, much like all of the devices and gadgets in our lives, is increasingly driven by software,” the PIRG report said. “While this software has increased the efficiency of some tasks, it has also allowed manufacturers to take increasing control of the repair process.”</p><p>PIRG报告说：“就像我们生活中的所有设备和小工具一样，农业设备越来越受软件驱动，”。 “尽管该软件提高了某些任务的效率，但它也使制造商能够更好地控制维修过程。”</p><p>  Like cars, farm equipment is increasingly controlled by an elaborate and complex web of computer sensors. When one of these sensors notices an error, no matter how small or serious, it puts the machine into “limp mode.” This allows farmers to move the machine slowly but not operate it fully. When the problem is diagnosed and repaired, the error code is cleared and the machine can keep working.</p><p>  像汽车一样，农用设备也越来越受到复杂且复杂的计算机传感器网络的控制。当这些传感器中的一个发现错误时，无论大小如何，都会使机器进入“滑行模式”。这使农民可以缓慢移动机器，但不能完全操作机器。诊断并修复问题后，错误代码将被清除，并且机器可以继续工作。</p><p>  The problem is that farmers often don’t have access to the diagnostic software and repair tools they need to make the fix. According to U.S. PIRG, the John Deere S760 combine harvester has 125 different computer sensors in it. If those sensors start throwing an error code, the combine won’t run and the farmer doesn’t have immediate access to the tools they need to fix the problem.</p><p>  问题在于，农民通常无法获得修复所需的诊断软件和维修工具。根据美国PIRG，John Deere S760联合收割机中有125个不同的计算机传感器。如果这些传感器开始抛出错误代码，则联合收割机将无法运行，农民将无法立即获得解决问题所需的工具。</p><p>  &#34;It doesn’t matter how industrious they are, what their planting window looks like, or if their tractor goes down right as weather threatens to destroy their crop—modern farming equipment is designed so that farmers need to call the dealership to repair their machines,&#34; O&#39;Reilly said.</p><p>  ＆＃34;不管他们有多勤奋，他们的种植窗口是什么样子，还是因为天气有可能毁坏农作物而导致拖拉机正好停下来的问题，现代农业设备的设计都使农民需要致电经销商修理他们的机器，＆＃34;奥赖利说。</p><p>  At a  town hall meeting of the Montana Farmers Union on February 8, Farmers Union president Walter Sweitzer shared a personal story about how a broken tractor affected his farm. Last summer, he was having problems with his new tractor. He didn’t have the hardware and software he needed to figure out the error code and fix the tractor on his own so he had to send it back to his dealer for repair.</p><p>  在2月8日的蒙大拿州农民联盟的市政厅会议上，农民联盟主席Walter Sweitzer分享了一个个人故事，内容是拖拉机损坏如何影响他的农场。去年夏天，他在新拖拉机方面遇到了问题。他没有所需的硬件和软件来找出错误代码并自行修理拖拉机，因此他不得不将其发送回经销商进行维修。</p><p>  “It was a simple fix,” Sweiter said. “It was a fuel sensor, it only cost about $800 to actually do the fix. But when it was all said and done, when you paid for freight, when you paid for the hours that it was there, my bill was about $5,000….if I could have just bought that software, I could have known right away my problem and either fixed it or had the dealer come out with the part to fix it. When I shared my story, I heard from farmers all over the state that they’re having the same problem.”</p><p>  “这是一个简单的解决方法，” Sweiter说。 “这是一个燃油传感器，实际修理只需花费约800美元。但是，当一切都说完了，当您付了运费，当您付了那笔费用后，我的账单大约是5,000美元……。如果我能买那个软件，我马上就能知道我的问题了。然后要么修复它，要么让经销商拿出一部分进行修复。当我分享我的故事时，我听到全州的农民都在遇到同样的问题。”</p><p>   Sweitzer is one of the few people who in recent weeks  has seemingly been able to at least get information about how to obtain the things promised by the manufacturers&#39; commitment. A dealer near him wanted $8,000 for software, equipment, and training before it would give it to him.</p><p>   Sweitzer是最近几周似乎至少能够获得有关如何获得制造商承诺的东西的信息的少数人之一。承诺。他附近的一个经销商要价8,000美元用于软件，设备和培训，然后才能付给他。 </p><p>  &#34;There’s farms where $8,000 is not that big of a deal, but this isn&#39;t being advertised and it&#39;s also not widely available,&#34; Proctor said. &#34;This is example 1A of why repair monopolies are bad.&#34;</p><p>＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆nbsp;＆quot;普罗克特说。 ＆＃34;这是为什么维修垄断很糟糕的示例1A。</p><p>  The problem with new machines is so bad that farmers are taking drastic action to repair their own equipment. Some have  become hackers, using software and tools they’ve found online to diagnose and repair their equipment. Others are buying 40-year old tractors because they still function and they’re  more repairable than new models.</p><p>  新机器的问题是如此严重，以至于农民正在采取激烈的行动来修理自己的设备。有些人已经成为黑客，使用他们在网上找到的软件和工具来诊断和维修设备。其他人则购买了40年的旧拖拉机，因为它们仍然可以工作，并且比新型号更易于维修。</p><p>  As the problem has become more pronounced, legislators are trying to pass right-to-repair laws that would help farmers repair their own equipment. LC 1562 in Montana is one example, a  simple piece of legislation that would make it easier for farmers to access the information they need to make repairs.</p><p>  随着问题变得更加严重，立法者正试图通过维修权法律，以帮助农民修理自己的设备。蒙大拿州的LC 1562就是一个例子，这是一项简单的立法，可以使农民更轻松地获取他们进行维修所需的信息。</p><p>  “What the bill does, overall, is give the owner the ability to purchase the diagnostic tools to make repairs themselves, saving time and money,” Katie Sullivan, a Missoula area state representative said during the town hall. “It supports farmers who don’t have the time to wait for mechanics or have the extra money to spend just to fix a small issue.”</p><p>  密苏拉州州代表凯蒂·沙利文（Katie Sullivan）在市政厅表示：“该法案的全部目的是使业主能够购买诊断工具以自行维修，从而节省时间和金钱。” “它为那些没有时间等待机械师或没有多余的钱用来解决小问题的农民提供支持。”</p><p>  It was the explicit intention of Deere, the manufacturers, and the dealers to kill the right to repair bills with their 2018 promise. At the time, Motherboard  wrote that the agreement was a half measure, and that the California Farm Bureau sold out farmers by agreeing to it. Soon after that article was published, Michael O&#39;Brien, a spokesperson with the AEM wrote to Motherboard to tell us they believed the article was unfair, and said, at length, that right to repair laws (specifically one that was being proposed in Nebraska) were now &#34;unnecessary.&#34;</p><p>  迪尔（Deere），制造商和经销商的明确意图是按照其2018年的承诺杀死维修账单的权利。当时，母板写道，该协议只是一半，加利福尼亚农场局同意将其卖光。该文章发表后不久，AEM发言人迈克尔·布莱恩（Michael O＆＃39）致母板告诉我们，他们认为该文章不公平，并详尽地说，修复法律的权利（特别是正在提出的法律）现在在内布拉斯加州不再需要了。</p><p>  &#34;What farm equipment manufacturers have agreed to do is to make available a comprehensive suite of electronic service tools that allow a dealer or independent repair providers who want to acquire those tools and training on how to use them to make repairs on farm equipment,&#34; O&#39;Brien wrote. &#34;We oppose any legislation that would provide access to source code for the reasons (safety and environmental compliance, and IP) we’ve discussed. We view the proposal in Nebraska–and the other states where different, though similar, right to repair laws have been proposed–as overly-broad and unnecessary in light of the tools being made available through the statement of principles.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;农场设备制造商同意做的是提供一整套电子服务工具，允许希望获得这些工具的经销商或独立维修提供者以及有关如何使用它们进行农场设备维修的培训，＆＃34;布莱恩（O＆Brien）写道。 ＆＃34;我们反对出于我们讨论的原因（安全，环保和IP）提供访问源代码的任何立法。鉴于通过原则声明可以使用的工具，我们认为内布拉斯加州以及其他提出了不同（尽管相似）的修复权的州的提案过于广泛，没有必要。</p><p>  &#34;If we are making the tools available to empower farmers with the tools they need to service and repair equipment, why are R2R laws that cover farm equipment necessary at all?,&#34; he added. &#34;It keeps coming back to this: If a farmer wants to repair the equipment, and we’re making available the tools to do so in a good-faith effort to address their code needs, then why do we need to pass these Right to Repair laws covering farm equipment?&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;如果我们要提供可用的工具，以使农民能够使用他们维修和修理设备所需的工具，那么为什么完全需要涵盖农业设备的R2R法律呢？＆＃34;他加了。 ＆＃34;一直这样：如果一个农民想要维修设备，而我们正努力提供工具来满足他们的代码需求，那么为什么我们需要通过这些涉及农用设备的维修权法律吗？＆＃34; </p><p>  Deere has claimed that it can’t allow farmers access to the computer system at this level because it’s a security risk and might lead to farmers breaking federal law. “Sometimes, these modifications can be altered and now the machine is not functioning as it was intended,” Vancil said at a webinar about right to repair with the  Florida Farm Bureau last week. “It also starts getting into some areas, if you&#39;re talking about emissions, that get into the area where you start having federal topics being introduced from an emissions standpoint.”</p><p>迪尔（Deere）声称，由于存在安全隐患，因此不允许农民在此级别访问计算机系统，这可能会导致农民违反联邦法律。 Vancil上周在关于佛罗里达州农业局维修权的网络研讨会上说：“有时，这些修改可以更改，现在机器无法正常运行。” “如果您正在谈论排放，它也开始进入某些领域，从排放的角度开始引入联邦主题。”</p><p>  The problem is that no farmer is talking about hacking their tractor to bypass emission standards or steal John Deere’s source code. No pending right-to-repair legislation mentions source code or calls for farmers to be able to access farm equipment’s embedded software beyond what a dealership already has access to.</p><p>  问题在于，没有任何农民在谈论黑客入侵拖拉机以绕过排放标准或窃取约翰迪尔的源代码。尚无任何待决的维修权立法提及源代码，也没有要求农民在经销商无法访问的范围内访问农场设备的嵌入式软件。</p><p>  It would not be difficult for John Deere and other manufacturers to comply with a right to repair law, or, at the very least, to abide by its own promise. Europe  has had some right to repair regulations which require &#34;standardized access to repair and maintenance information (RMI) systems to provide repair and maintenance information for vehicles used in agriculture and forestry&#34;  since 2013, and manufacturers comply with those.</p><p>  对于约翰迪尔（John Deere）和其他制造商而言，遵守修理法律的权利，或者至少遵守其自身的诺言并不困难。欧洲拥有一些维修法规的权利，该法规要求对维修和保养信息（RMI）系统进行标准化访问，以为农业和林业用车辆提供维修和保养信息。自2013年以来，制造商一直遵守这些规定。</p><p>  And so the solution in the United States seems like it&#39;s going to have to be the same. Not a promise from manufacturers and dealers, but legislation with the force of law.</p><p>  因此，在美国，解决方案似乎必须相同。不是制造商和经销商的承诺，而是具有法律效力的立法。</p><p>  &#34;The best recourse is that states pass right to repair legislation given that Deere pitched this as a way to avoid or delay or defer states passing right to repair laws that would impact ag equipment,&#34; Sheehan said. &#34;Well, you didn’t do what you promised you’d do. We’re back to legislating.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;最好的办法是，鉴于迪尔（Deere）提出此举是避免或延迟或推迟各州通过可能影响设备的维修法律的权利，各州都有权通过维修法律的权利，＆＃34;希恩说。 ＆＃34;嗯，您没有按照您的承诺去做。我们将重新立法。＆＃34;</p><p>  By signing up to the VICE newsletter you agree to receive electronic communications from VICE that may sometimes include advertisements or sponsored content.</p><p>  签署VICE新闻通讯，即表示您同意接收来自VICE的电子通讯，其中有时可能包含广告或赞助内容。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m8mx/john-deere-promised-farmers-it-would-make-tractors-easy-to-repair-it-lied">https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7m8mx/john-deere-promised-farmers-it-would-make-tractors-easy-to-repair-it-lied</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/john/">#john</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/easy/">#easy</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/维修/">#维修</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
