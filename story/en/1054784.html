In the 1990s, Withey’s phone number was actually listed on every box of her mac and cheese — yes, Annie’s — which was slowly, steadily lining New England grocery store shelves.</p><p>情况并非总是如此。在20世纪90年代，Hyey的电话号码实际上是在她的每一个Mac和奶酪的每盒中都列出 - 是的，安妮的 - 这是慢慢，稳定的衬里杂货店货架。</p><p>  Strangers called Withey at all hours of the day. Once, at 3 a.m., she was awakened to a voicemail by an ensemble of partying surfer bros on the West Coast who wanted to know how to get their hands on a bulk order of mac and cheese.</p><p>  一天中的所有时间都在陌生人叫做。曾经凌晨3点，她被派对在西海岸的派对兄弟兄弟的集合被举办到语音邮件，他们想知道如何掌握批量掌握的Mac和奶酪。</p><p>  Funnily enough, Annie’s Homegrown is now based out west; its brightly colored headquarters, which includes a lovely looking garden, was established in Berkeley in 2011 and is where 50 or so employees normally work.</p><p>  有趣的是，安妮的本土现在基于西方;它在2011年伯克利建立了它的彩色总部，包括一个可爱的花园，是50左右的员工通常工作。</p><p>    Withey never relocated to California though. She lives quietly, privately on a farm in Connecticut. In 1988, then in her 20s,  she succinctly told Inc. magazine, “I don&#39;t really like business.&#34; Or media, for that matter.</p><p>    尽管如此，我从未搬迁到加利福尼亚州。她悄悄地生活在康涅狄格州的一个农场。 1988年，然后在她20多岁时，她简洁地告诉Inc.杂志，“我不喜欢生意。＆＃34;或媒体，此事。</p><p>    Business, however you want to define it, has made Withey a wealthy woman, even as she’s completely removed herself from the company that she created (which is far more than just mac and cheese offerings these days). The long and the short of it is Solera Capital became the majority investor in Annie’s in 2002, then General Mills (which is  having an interesting week) bought out Annie’s in 2014 for a whopping $820 million. Withey was listed as “inspirational president” during the Solera Capital era, then left completely when General Mills took over.</p><p>    然而，您想要定义它，使其成为一个富有的女人，即使她完全从公司彻底删除了她所创造的公司（这几天只有Mac和奶酪产品）。漫长而缺乏的是Solera Capital于2002年成为Annie的大多数投资者，然后将军（具有有趣的一周）于2014年买了Annie，以获得8.2亿美元。在Solera Capital Era期间，HITHEY被列为“励志总裁”，当一般米尔斯接管时完全离开了。</p><p>    There’s been  much debate and reporting about the ethical dilemmas that arise when an enormous company like General Mills acquires an ostensibly environmentally conscious, organic brand like Annie’s,  whose mission is upholding “sustainable agriculture, organic ingredients, no artificial ingredients [and] support for farmers and communities.”</p><p>    当普通工厂的巨大公司获得了一个外翻环保意识的有机品牌时出现了很多辩论和报告，其使命是维护“可持续农业，有机成分，无人工成分[和]支持农民和社区。“</p><p>       But noticeably absent from those discussions, and noticeably absent more generally, is Withey herself. The more I read about Annie’s, the second-most popular mac and cheese brand in the United States behind Kraft, the more I wanted to know about the mysterious woman behind the brand. Her number isn’t on the boxes of mac and cheese anymore, obviously. So a few weeks ago, I left a voicemail for a number that I figured had a 50-50 shot of being accurate. Then I waited.</p><p>       但是，从那些讨论中缺乏明显，并且缺乏更普遍的讨论，是她自己。我读到了Annie的越多，美国在美国背后的第二次流行的Mac和奶酪品牌，我越想了解品牌背后的神秘女人。显然，她的号码不再是Mac和奶酪的盒子。所以几周前，我留下了一个语音信箱，我认为我的准确性为50-50次。然后我等了。 </p><p>     “You did have the correct phone number — our good ol&#39; landline,” Withey wrote. “Now you will have my personal email too.” She signed it “bye for now.”</p><p>“你确实拥有正确的电话号码 - 我们的好OL＆＃39;固定电话，“Hoty写道。 “现在你也会有我的个人电子邮件。”她签了它“现在再见”。</p><p>  I was tickled and intrigued. Was I about to become pen pals with the woman whose boxed mac and cheese was the comfort food of my (and many others&#39;) childhood? As it turns out, yes.</p><p>  我被诞生和兴趣。我和女人的舒适食物（以及许多其他人和＃39;）童年的舒适食物吗？事实证明，是的。</p><p>    The Annie’s mac and cheese origin story  has been told before, but if you aren&#39;t familiar with it, then you’re in for a twist and a treat. In 1984, when Withey was 21, she and her then-husband Andrew Martin came up with the product known as Smartfood in the kitchen of their Boston home. That’s correct: Annie, the Annie’s lady, is also the cheddar popcorn lady.</p><p>    之前的Annie的Mac和奶酪起源故事已经被告知，但如果你熟悉它，那么你就是为了扭曲和善待。 1984年，当赫蒂是21时，她和她的那个丈夫安德鲁马丁想出了被称为智能食品的产品在他们的波士顿家的厨房里。这是正确的：Annie，Annie的女士，也是Cheddar Popcorn Lady。</p><p>  Around the same time, Withey incorporated the dried powder cheese from the popcorn to create her mac and cheese recipe. “The shelves in my rather small refrigerator were dominated by half-gallon sized plastic tubs of powdered cheddar cheese samples from Land O&#39;Lakes,” Withey wrote to me over email, her preferred communication method. “I was in pursuit of an all-natural cheese popcorn recipe that used white cheddar cheese (not glow-in-the-dark orange!) While scooping the white cheddar powder one day, I had a ‘eureka’ moment.”</p><p>  在同时，Hyey将干燥的粉末乳酪纳入爆米花，以创造她的Mac和奶酪配方。 “我相当小的冰箱里的架子由来自土地O＆＃39的粉末切达干酪样本的半加仑大小的塑料浴缸占主导地位;”湖泊，“我通过电子邮件写信给我，她的首选通信方法。 “我追求了一颗全自然的奶酪爆米花配方，用白色的切达干酪（不是黑暗的橙色！），同时挖出白皮达粉的一天，我有一个'eureka'时刻。”</p><p>  She boiled elbow pasta from Kraft, measured an identical amount of white cheddar cheese as was in the Kraft packet, added butter and milk, and then... “Whoa!” was the summation of her first bites.</p><p>  她从牛皮纸中煮肘面，测量了相同数量的白色切达奶酪，如牛皮纸包，加入黄油和牛奶，然后......“哇！”是她的第一次叮咬的总结。</p><p>  She didn’t immediately pivot to mac and cheese, though. She says that idea “remained on the back burner” until Smartfood was sold to Frito-Lay in 1989, a $15 million windfall that enabled her to turn her attention back to her preferred venture.</p><p>  然而，她没有立即枢转到Mac和奶酪。她说，在1989年，SmartFood卖给斯堪尔费斯的斯堪顿议员，智能食品销往Quarto-Lay的想法，使她能够将注意力转回她首选的风险投资。</p><p>  Withey’s face was almost plastered on the original early &#39;90s rollout of mac and cheese boxes, but she “promptly put an end to that idea,” she says. She went with her bunny named Bernie instead. Withey has a keener eye for the business side of things than she allows herself to admit (or lets on). “There&#39;s nothing more powerful than word-of-mouth advertising,” she wrote to me. She employed “guerilla marketing” tactics and would drop off Annie’s boxes anywhere she could, really. “Physically putting boxes in the hands of people was so much fun for me,” she says.</p><p>  哈蒂的脸几乎在原来的早期涂抹了＆＃39; 90年代的Mac和奶酪盒子，但她“迅速结束了这个想法”，“她说。她和她的兔子一起去过伯尼。哈蒂对事物的业务方面有一个敏锐的眼睛，而她允许自己承认（或让我们）。 “没有比口碑广告更强大的东西，”她写信给我了。她雇用了“Guerilla Marketing”的策略，真的会在任何地方下降安妮的盒子。 “物理放在人手中的盒子对我来说非常有趣，”她说。 </p><p>    Initially, when folks called the number on the box, they asked for Annie’s by the case. Withey estimates that when her very first warehouse was based in Connecticut, before the Berkeley glow-up, she was personally sending out 50 cases a week. People sometimes showed up to her house to request more macaroni, which became a problem. The local postmaster started detouring folks who asked where she lived.</p><p>最初，当人们在盒子上称为号码时，他们要求案件的安妮。据估计，当她的第一个仓库是基于康涅狄格州的时候，在伯克利发光之前，她一周就个人发送了50例。人们有时会出现在她的房子里，要求更多的通心粉，这成为一个问题。当地的邮政局长开始纠缠于她住在哪里的人。</p><p>  By the mid-’90s, Annie’s main fulfillment center had moved to Massachusetts, and there were more hands on deck. Withey still made a point of writing letters both on the back of the packaging of her burgeoning product line and also to individuals who reached out. People of all ages, but especially kids, sent notes and photos and drawings and “meaningful little gifts,” she fondly recalls.</p><p>  到90年代中期，安妮的主要履行中心已搬到马萨诸塞州，甲板上有更多的手。仍然在她的蓬勃发展产品线的包装背面以及伸出的人的背面上写了一份写字信。所有年龄段的人，但特别是孩子们，送了笔记和照片和图纸和“有意义的小礼物”，她深情地回忆起。</p><p>    “I responded to thousands of letters, literally (I still have a callus on my finger from pen overuse!) and made the effort to answer all questions, offer advice and share some of my thoughts with the wonderful people who wrote to me,” she says.</p><p>    “我回应了成千上万的信件，从字面上（我的手指上有一个呼叫从笔过度使用！）并努力回答所有问题，提供建议并与我写给我的美妙人分享我的一些想法，”她说。</p><p>  At the same time, Withey was growing wary of the day-to-day side of the business. After her daughter was born in 1997, Withey found comfort in organic farming and began selling vegetables at farmers markets in the area. It afforded her a modicum of anonymity, and let her put food directly into people’s hands again.</p><p>  与此同时，Hyey正在屈服于业务日常一天的警惕。女儿在1997年出生之后，有机农业的舒适感，并开始在该地区的农民市场销售蔬菜。它提供了一个匿名的modicum，让她再次将食物直接放入人们的手中。</p><p>  When Solera Capital swooped in, Withey saw an exit plan. She assumed the “inspirational president” title so she could mostly get out of the way. “I made it clear that I wasn’t comfortable being the spokesperson for the company and, thankfully, there were people in place that stepped up as spokespeople,” she says.</p><p>  当Solera Capital擅长的时候，Hyey看到了一个退出计划。她担任“励志总统”冠军，所以她大大都会走开。 “我明确表示，我不舒服是公司的发言人，谢天谢地，有人在上面加强了发言人，”她说。</p><p>  Trend pieces with lots of jargon sprung forth about Annie’s space in the organic food realm; the boxed mac and cheese became readily available across the United States and the company eventually moved its headquarters to Berkeley, then was bought out by General Mills. Withey fully cut ties with her product, and I can confirm her annie@annies.com email address sadly is not active anymore.</p><p>  潮流件与大量术语在有机食品领域的安妮的空间上涌出;盒装MAC和奶酪在美国易于获得，公司最终将其总部迁至伯克利，然后由一般厂铺购买。用她的产品完全切断了联系，我可以确认她的Annie@annies.com遗憾的是遗憾的不再活跃。</p><p>  During our correspondence, I asked Withey for her honest assessment of how General Mills is doing in her stead. “Although I don’t have any contact with the folks at General Mills, I have learned that they are committed to converting one million acres of conventional, degraded agricultural land to sustainable, no-till acreage within the next decade,” she wrote. “I am hopeful that they will quickly learn that crop yield is greater with no-till practices (plus countless other benefits) and that their conversion timeline will be accelerated.</p><p>  在我们的信函期间，我向她的诚实评估普通米尔斯在她的替代方面做的诚实评估。 “虽然我没有与普通工厂的人们联系，但我已经了解到，他们致力于将一百万英亩的传统农业用地转化为可持续的，没有直接在未来十年内，”她写道。 “我希望他们能够快速了解​​，由于没有惯例（加上无数的其他福利），并且他们的转换时间表将加快作物产量更大。 </p><p>  “[But] I do believe that General Mills gets it,” she continued. “There’s no denying that Annie’s is a special brand, and they know it would be detrimental not to keep the mission and culture intact.”</p><p>“[但]我相信一般磨坊得到它，”她继续。 “安妮的是一个特殊品牌，没有否认，他们知道这将是不可行的，保持使命和文化完整。”</p><p>    There are plenty of wealthy folks who talk a big talk about their commitment to the environment and their community, then live in excess privately. I do not think Withey is one of those folks; I’d bet a lifetime supply of mac and cheese that she has never munched on gold-flaked pasta, for instance. She’s remained in Connecticut in an early 1900s Victorian farmhouse with her husband because that’s what brings her happiness. She has four cows, seven sheep, a burro, two horses, two flocks of chickens, a dog and of course two house rabbits, who she says offer “entertainment and comfort.” She considers her job to be “keeping Mother Nature at bay.” When I asked about her hobbies, especially during the pandemic, she responded, “I guess my love of birds is a hobby.” Also, monitoring her house plants. And in case you were wondering, Withey still eats Annie’s once or twice a month, which she buys from her local co-op. “I don’t feel like I have reached mac and cheese burnout,” she says.</p><p>    有很多富人的富人谈论他们对环境和社区的承诺，那么私下过多。我不认为是那些人之一;例如，我会敢打赌一生的Mac和奶酪，以至于她从未咀嚼过金片面食。她在1900年代初的维多利亚时代的农舍和她的丈夫留在康涅狄格州，因为这是带来幸福的事。她有四头奶牛，七只羊，一个驴子，两匹马，两群鸡，一只狗，当然是两个房子兔子，她说“娱乐和舒适”。她认为她的工作是“在海湾保持母亲的母亲”。当我问她的爱好时，特别是在大流行期间，她回答道，“我猜我对鸟类的热爱是一种爱好。”此外，监测她的房子植物。如果你想知道，我仍然每月吃Annie的一次或两次，她从她当地的合作社中购买。 “我不想达到Mac和奶酪倦怠，”她说。</p><p>  In addition to my burning questions, I was compelled to tell Withey that one of my colleagues has children who love Annie’s, and when I was a &#39;90s kid, Annie’s was a staple of my diet, too. I was allergic to dozens of foods, which limited my palate and made me an even pickier eater than other children. Annie’s was luxury cuisine as far as I was concerned; I had the Alfredo mac and cheese for my birthday on at least three occasions. I still eat it a bunch, maybe more than a grown man is supposed to.</p><p>  除了我的燃烧问题外，我被迫告诉我的一个同事有一个同事有爱安妮的孩子，当我是一个＆＃39; 90s孩子，安妮也是我饮食的主食。我对数十种食物过敏，这限制了我的口味，并使我比其他孩子更加挑选的食物。据我所知，安妮是豪华美食;我至少有三次为我的生日有Alfredo Mac和奶酪。我仍然吃它一堆，也许比长大的男人所在。</p><p>  To this, Withey says that my Annie’s story warms her heart, which warms my heart. I&#39;ve since realized that I essentially emailed her the equivalent of one of those letters she used to regularly receive.</p><p>  为此，我说，我的安妮的故事温暖了她的心，让我的心脏变暖。我＆＃39; ve意识到我本质上通过电子邮件向她提供了相当于她过去经常接受的那些信件中的一种。</p><p>  “I don’t tire of the kind words I hear from people when they find out that I am Annie,” she says. “What really blows my mind is many of those younger people that I wrote to [in the &#39;90s] are having kids and serving them Annie’s. Pretty amazing. Fills me with pride.”</p><p>  “当我发现我是安妮时，我不厌倦我从人们听到的话语，”她说。 “真正打击我的思绪是我写给[在＆＃39; 90年代]的年轻人中的许多年轻人都有孩子和为他们服务。相当了不起。以骄傲填补我。“ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Annie-s-Mac-and-Cheese-is-based-in-Bay-Area-but-16049782.php">https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Annie-s-Mac-and-Cheese-is-based-in-Bay-Area-but-16049782.php</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mac/">#mac</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/annie/">#annie</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
