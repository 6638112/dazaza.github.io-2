It’s known that Seqenenre died during this conflict, but it’s been unclear whether he was assassinated in his bed in the palace at Thebes or died on the battlefield.</p><p> 法老Seqenenre在公元前1550年代率领军队从上埃及面对希克索斯人，这是一群来自黎凡特的战士，他们占领了下埃及，并在历史学家所说的第二个中级时期向上埃及致敬。众所周知，塞克南雷（Seqenenre）在这场冲突中丧生，但是目前尚不清楚他是在暗杀中被暗杀在底比斯（Thebes）宫殿还是在战场上丧生。</p><p> A computed tomography (CT) scan offered a look at his wounds, along with the details of his mummification. Radiologist Sahar Saleem of Cairo University and former Egyptian Minister of Antiquities Zahi Hawass concluded that he most likely died near the front lines and was brought back to Thebes for mummification and burial.</p><p> 计算机断层扫描（CT）扫描显示了他的伤口以及木乃伊的细节。开罗大学放射学家萨哈尔·萨利姆（Sahar Saleem）和前埃及古物部长扎希·哈瓦斯（Zahi Hawass）得出结论，他极有可能在前线附近死亡，并被送回底比斯进行木乃伊化和埋葬。</p><p>  Archaeologists rediscovered Seqenenre’s tomb in the 1880s. In the 1960s, an X-ray of his mummy revealed the injuries that probably killed him: cut, cracked, and shattered bones in his forehead, nose, cheek, and the base of his skull. All the wounds seemed to be on the left side of the pharaoh’s head, which suggested that he could have been lying on his right side when his attackers struck.</p><p>  考古学家在1880年代重新发现了塞克嫩雷墓。在1960年代，他的木乃伊的X光片显示出可能导致他死亡的伤害：前额，鼻子，脸颊和颅骨的骨头被割伤，破裂和破碎。所有的伤口似乎都在法老的头部的左侧，这表明攻击者袭击时他本可以躺在右侧。</p><p> That gave rise to the palace conspiracy theory, which suggested that Seqenenre’s own courtiers had arranged for the king to be murdered in his sleep. Another idea held that the pharaoh had been executed by the Hyksos King Apophis after being captured in battle; that got support from the condition of Seqenenre’s mummy, which had a foul smell and was partially disarticulated when archaeologists unearthed him in the 1880s. That evidence seemed to suggest that he’d been mummified somewhere less well-equipped than the royal funerary workshop near Thebes—perhaps a hasty field mortuary somewhere between Thebes and Avaris.</p><p> 这引起了宫殿的阴谋论，这表明塞克南雷自己的朝臣们已经安排让国王在睡觉时被谋杀。另一个想法认为，法老王在战斗中被希克索斯国王阿波菲斯处死。它得到了Seqenenre的木乃伊的支持，木乃伊的味道很臭，在1880年代考古学家发掘出他时，木乃伊就被部分地清除了。这些证据似乎表明，他被人木乃伊化为底比斯附近的皇家葬礼工场，而那里的装备木乃伊—也许是底比斯和阿瓦里斯之间草率的somewhere葬场。</p><p> A recent CT scan ruled out the midnight assassination plot. Instead, the evidence supports the idea that the Hyksos captured the Egyptian pharaoh in battle, executed him—with considerable overkill—and then allowed the Egyptians to take his body back to Thebes.</p><p> 最近的CT扫描排除了午夜暗杀的阴谋。取而代之的是，证据支持希克索斯人在战斗中俘获了埃及法老王，以相当大的杀伤力处决了他，然后允许埃及人将其遗体带回底比斯。</p><p> The CT images revealed another set of injuries on the left side of the pharaoh’s head, which the ancient embalmers had concealed so cleverly that it didn’t show up in the 1960s X-ray images. Based on the angle of the wounds, most of the blows had landed while the king was upright, although they’d also come from slightly above him, as if his attackers had stood over him while he knelt. Seqenenre’s wrists and hands looked as if they’d been bound behind his back when he died; despite the devastating injuries to his head and face, his arms showed no signs of attempts to block the blows. Additionally, his wrists were flexed in a way that suggested they’d been bound when he died, and spasms at the moment of death had left the muscles locked in that position.</p><p> CT图像显示了法老王头部左侧的另一组伤害，古代的防腐工曾如此巧妙地将其隐藏起来，以至于在1960年代的X射线图像中都没有出现。根据伤口的角度，大部分的打击是在国王直立时落下的，尽管这些打击也是从他的上方稍稍过来的，好像他的袭击者在他跪下时站在他的上方。 Seqenenre的手腕和手看起来好像在他死后被绑在他的背后；尽管他的头部和面部遭受了毁灭性的伤害，但他的手臂没有显示出试图阻止打击的迹象。此外，他的手腕弯曲时暗示他死后会被绑住，而死亡时的痉挛使肌肉锁定在该位置。 </p><p>    Overall, it looked as if the king knelt with his hands bound while Hyksos soldiers wielding a mixture of weapons dealt a series of lethal blows. The efforts to repair or conceal the damage after death suggested that he had, in fact, been treated by well-equipped professional embalmers, but the work had been delayed until after the early stages of decomposition.</p><p>总的来说，看起来好像国王跪在地上，而希克索斯的士兵挥舞着各种武器，进行了一系列致命的打击。修复或掩盖死后伤害的努力表明，他实际上已经得到了装备精良的专业防腐剂的治疗，但工作被推迟到分解的早期阶段。</p><p>  Around 1650 BCE, a group of people from the Levant took over the northern half of Egypt. The Hyksos, as the Egyptians called their foreign rulers, set up a capital at Avaris, a city in the Nile Delta, and from there they ruled Lower Egypt (the northern end of the Nile valley) and exerted enough influence to demand regular tribute payments from the Egyptian kings of Lower Egypt (the southern end of the kingdom). And in the 1550s, the Hyksos’ King Apophis sent a rude letter to Egypt’s Pharaoh Seqenenre at Thebes.</p><p>  公元前1650年左右，一群来自黎凡特的人占领了埃及的北半部。埃及人称他们为外国统治者的希克索斯人在尼罗河三角洲的城市阿瓦里斯建立首都，然后从那里统治下埃及（尼罗河谷的北端）并施加了足够的影响力，要求定期向他捐款来自下埃及（王国的南端）的埃及国王。在1550年代，希克索斯国王Apophis向底比斯的埃及法老Seqenenre发送了一封粗鲁的信。</p><p> The hippopotamuses in a sacred pool at Thebes were bellowing all night, Apophis wrote, and their racket was disturbing his sleep. An Egyptian text records that Apophis demanded the death of the hippos and the destruction of the sacred pool. Of course, since Avaris lay several hundred kilometers north of Thebes, Apophis clearly just wanted to start some trouble (or later Egyptian historians wanted to make it look as if he had).</p><p> 阿波菲斯写道，在底比斯（Thebes）的一个神圣水池中的河马整夜都在吼叫，他们的球拍打扰了他的睡眠。埃及的文字记录说，阿波菲斯要求杀死河马和破坏圣池。当然，由于阿瓦里斯（Avaris）位于底比斯（Thebes）以北几百公里处，因此阿波菲斯（Apophis）显然只是想制造一些麻烦（或者后来的埃及历史学家想让它看起来像他那样）。</p><p> “The end of the papyrus is lost, but the preserved text ends with the statement that Seqenenre called his counselors, which probably indicates an introduction to a battle,” wrote Saleem and Hawass.</p><p> 萨利姆和哈瓦斯写道：“纸莎草纸的尽头丢失了，但是保留下来的文字以塞克南雷称他的顾问为名结束，这很可能说明了一场战斗的开始。”</p><p> Based on inscriptions on the ruins at what is now Deir El Ballas, just north of Thebes, Seqenenre seems to have ordered the construction of a fortress there sometime during his reign. Surviving documents describe how troops and supplies assembled there before marching north against the Hyksos. And if Saleem and Hawass are right, Seqenenre himself was on the front lines with his troops.</p><p> 根据现在位于底比斯以北的Deir El Ballas遗址上的铭文，Seqenenre似乎已下令在他统治期间的某个时间建造一座堡垒。尚存的文件描述了部队和补给品如何在向北向Hyksos进军之前在那里聚集。如果萨利姆（Saleem）和哈瓦斯（Hawass）是对的，则塞克南雷（Seqenenre）本人将与他的部队站在前线。</p><p>  No ancient documents survive to tell us the outcome or even the location of the battle between Seqenenre and Apophis. We don’t even have records of exactly when or how Seqenenre died, which is why there was room for the palace conspiracy theory to develop. But it’s almost certain that the two armies met somewhere between Thebes and Avaris, and 7,000 years later, Seqenenre’s remains tell the story of his final moments.</p><p>  没有远古的文献可以告诉我们塞克嫩雷和阿波菲斯之间的战斗结果或位置。我们甚至都没有确切的记录Seqenenre死于何时或如何，这就是为什么宫廷阴谋论有发展的空间。但是几乎可以肯定，两军在底比斯和阿瓦里斯之间相遇了，而7,000年后，塞肯纳尔的遗物讲述了他的最后时刻。</p><p> For example, fractures tend to be wider in the direction from which the blow came, since the impact is stronger on that side. Blunt objects damage bones and soft tissue differently than sharp ones, and the width of a fracture can also tell you about the size of the blade that caused it.</p><p> 例如，在冲击发生的方向上，裂缝往往更宽，因为在那一侧的冲击更强。钝物对骨骼和软组织的损伤与锋利的损伤不同，骨折的宽度还可以告诉您造成该损伤的刀片的大小。 </p><p> Saleem and Hawass compared Seqenenre’s injuries to a collection of Hyksos weapons, including daggers, spearheads, axes, and swords. They noticed, for instance, that the axes Apophis’ soldiers carried had smaller cutting edges than those of Seqenenre’s troops, and they made deeper, more focused cuts. The researchers also managed to reconstruct the positions of the pharaoh’s killers, the weapons they used, and how he died. (Fair warning, the next few paragraphs are pretty graphic.)</p><p>Saleem和Hawass将Seqenenre的受伤与Hyksos的一系列武器进行了比较，其中包括匕首，矛头，斧头和剑。他们注意到，例如，阿波菲斯士兵携带的斧头的刃口比塞克南雷的士兵要小的刃口，而且他们进行了更深，更集中的切割。研究人员还设法重建了法老的杀手的位置，他们使用的武器以及他的死亡方式。 （警告，接下来的几段非常漂亮。）</p><p>    Someone standing in front of the kneeling king swung a sharp, heavy weapon—a sword or an axe—and struck his forehead from the left side. A sharp, double-edged weapon like an axe split his right eyebrow. And someone standing to the king’s left stabbed him with something long and sharp, probably a spearhead, which pierced his skull just below his left ear and thrust toward the brainstem.</p><p>    站在跪着的国王面前的有人挥舞了一把锋利的重型武器（一把剑或一把斧头），并从左侧击中了他的前额。一把锋利的双刃武器，如斧头，劈开了他的右眉。站在国王左边的人用长而锋利的东西刺伤了他，可能是矛头，刺穿了他的头骨，就在他的左耳下方，并朝脑干推进。</p><p> “Any one of those injuries is a potential cause of death, but the three of them together is almost certainly fatal,” wrote Saleem and Hawass.</p><p> Saleem和Hawass写道：“这些伤害中的任何一个都是潜在的死亡原因，但其中三者合起来肯定是致命的。”</p><p> Other wounds may not have been lethal, but at that stage, it probably didn’t matter. The Hyksos were making a point. Several blows from a heavy, blunt object—maybe a staff or the shaft of an axe—in the hands of someone towering over the king and slightly to his right, shattered Seqenenre’s nose, right cheek, and right eye socket. Someone on the king’s left, perhaps the same person who struck the first lethal blow, left a deep cut on his left cheek which fractured the bone beneath.</p><p> 其他伤口可能没有致死性，但是在那个阶段，可能没有关系。 Hyksos指出了这一点。一个重而钝的物体（可能是法杖或斧头）在高耸于国王上方并略微偏向他的人的手中打了几下，打碎了塞肯纳尔的鼻子，右脸颊和右眼窝。国王左手的某人，也许是遭受第一次致命一击的那个人，在他的左脸颊上留下了深深的伤口，使下方的骨头断裂。</p><p> What may have been among the final blows, from a blunt object, landed on the right side of the king’s skull. The angle of the blow suggests it came from directly above the king, and he may have been lying on his left side at that point, felled by the earlier onslaught. Pharaoh Seqenenre, born Taa, was dead.</p><p> 最终的一击，可能是从钝器降落在国王头骨的右侧。打击的角度表明，打击是从国王的正上方来的，那一刻他可能一直躺在他的左侧，被较早的猛攻击倒了。出生于塔阿（Taa）的法老Seqenenre去世了。</p><p>  Some time would pass before the royal remains could be properly mummified, though, and Saleem and Hawass saw evidence of that in the CT images. First of all, the embalmers left Seqenenre’s brain in his skull, although they removed his other organs through an incision on his left side. Leaving the brain is unusual, but it allowed Saleem and Hawass to see that the pharaoh’s gray matter had shifted toward the left side of his skull, which probably means that he lay on his left side—the way he seemed to have fallen by the time the last of his assailants’ blows landed—for at least a few days after he died.</p><p>  不过，要把皇家遗体适当地木乃伊化还需要一段时间，萨利姆和哈瓦斯在CT图像中看到了这一点的证据。首先，防腐剂将塞克南人的大脑留在了他的头骨上，尽管他们通过左侧切口切除了他的其他器官。离开大脑是不寻常的，但它使Saleem和Hawass看到法老的灰质已经移向他的头骨的左侧，这可能意味着他躺在他的左侧—那时他似乎已经跌倒了他的最后一个袭击者的打击降落了-在他死后至少几天。</p><p> Saleem and Hawass suggest that, along with the general state of the king’s corpse, could mean that he died far away from the royal embalmers’ workshop at Thebes and had to be transported back. The quality of the embalming, which tried to restore his appearance and conceal his wounds, suggests expert embalmers with good equipment and materials at their disposal. That seems to rule out the idea that Seqenenre was embalmed on the battlefield where he fell.</p><p> 萨利姆和哈瓦斯认为，连同国王尸体的一般状况，可能意味着他死于远离底比斯的皇家涂漆工车间，必须将其运回。试图恢复其外观并掩盖伤口的防腐质量表明，专业的防腐剂具有良好的设备和材料可供使用。这似乎排除了塞克南雷在他倒下的战场上被防腐的想法。 </p><p> Seqenenre’s death at the hands of the Hyksos, and the sheer brutality of its nature, may have galvanized the kingdom to fight back against its conquerors. Seqenenre’s oldest son, Kamose, went on to become pharaoh and also campaigned against the Hyksos; he, too, died in battle. Kamose’s younger brother Ahmose took up the mantle, expelled the Hyksos, and reunited Egypt. His reign marks the end of the Second Intermediate Period and the beginning of the New Kingdom.</p><p>Seqenenre死于Hyksos手中，其残酷的性格可能激起了该国与征服者的战斗。 塞肯嫩（Seqenenre）的大儿子Kamose继续成为法老，并竞选反对Hyksos； 他也死于战斗。 Kamose的弟弟Ahmose占领了地幔，驱逐了Hyksos，并重新组建了埃及。 他的统治标志着第二个中期的结束和新王国的开始。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/ct-shows-ancient-egyptian-pharaoh-was-captured-in-battle-and-executed/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/ct-shows-ancient-egyptian-pharaoh-was-captured-in-battle-and-executed/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/显示/">#显示</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/shows/">#shows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/埃及/">#埃及</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
