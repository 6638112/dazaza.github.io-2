He will continue to also hold the CEO position. This makes it the first time since 2000, when co-founder Bill Gates stepped down as CEO, that the same person is holding both positions, demonstrating the company\u2019s confidence in Nadella\u2019s ability to take it into the future.\n  In February 2014, when Nadella was appointed CEO, Microsoft\u2019s flagship Windows business was weakening, and the company was struggling with its failures in the mobile phone and internet search markets. Nadella, who grew up in Hyderabad and joined Microsoft in the US in 1992, refocused the company around cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and instilled a greater sense of ownership among employees \u2014 moves that paid off handsomely. The company\u2019s share price has risen nearly 600% since 2014. And since the fourth quarter of 2018, Microsoft has frequently been the most valued publicly listed company in the world, with Apple the only other contender for that spot.\n On Nadella\u2019s appointment as chairman, Microsoft said in a statement, \u201cIn this role, Nadella will lead the work to set the agenda for the board leveraging his deep understanding of the business to elevate the right strategic opportunities and identify key risks and mitigation approaches for the board\u2019s review.\u201d\n Nadella, 53, succeeds John Thompson, a former CEO of Symantec who took over as chairman when Gates stepped down from that post in 2014.\n In December, in a filing to the US stock market regulator SEC, the board heaped praise on Nadella for the way he navigated the company through the pandemic, and the manner in which he had transformed the company\u2019s culture. \u201cDuring fiscal year 2020, Microsoft increased revenue by 14% year over year, while facing unprecedented constraints due to Covid-19 in the second half of the year. Under Mr Nadella\u2019s leadership during 2020, many of Microsoft\u2019s products achieved significant growth\u2026,\u201d it said.\n The board, the filing said, had asked Nadella to create additional focus on the culture of the organisation for fiscal year 2020 and is very pleased with the results that were achieved. \u201cBased on poll data, 95% of employees feel proud to work at Microsoft. The board credits Mr Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organisation,\u201d it said.\n Nadella was born in Hyderabad. His mother was a Sanskrit lecturer and his father an IAS officer. He attended the Hyderabad Public School, and went on to do a Bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology in Karnataka. He then went to the US to do a Master\u2019s in computer science at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.\n  Microsoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article.\n            Opens in a new window  Opens an external site  Opens an external site in a new window", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:49:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5fae\u8f6f,microsoft,ceo", "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u4e3b\u5e2d ", "title_en": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Now Also Elevated to Microsoft's Chairman", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/satya-nadella-elevated-as-microsoft-chairman/ar-AALa3HE", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5fae\u8f6f", "microsoft", "ceo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7ba9870e9562b164b17858b3a511c10c.jpeg", "infoid": 1066929, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5468\u56db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u94c1\u9508\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5199\u4f5c\u90e8\u5206\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\uff0339;\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8Linux\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u52aa\u529b\u6765\u589e\u52a0Linux\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\n       \u5982\u679c\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

Such a change would mark a major technological and cultural shift for an open-source software project that&#39;s become foundational to Google&#39;s Android and Chrome operating systems as well as vast swaths of the internet.\n Miguel Ojeda, who&#39;s written software used by the  Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator and worked on programming language security, is being contracted to write software in  Rust for the Linux kernel. Google is paying for the contract, which is being extended through the  Internet Security Research Group, a nonprofit that&#39;s also made it easier to  secure website communications through the  Let&#39;s Encrypt effort.\n       Adding Rust modules to the Linux kernel would improve security by closing some avenues for hackers can use to attack phones, computers or servers. Since it was launched in 1991, Linux has been written solely in the powerful but old  C programming language. The language was developed in 1972 and is more vulnerable to hacks than contemporary programming languages.\n    Better security for Linux is good news for everyone but hackers. In addition to the Android and Chrome OSes, Google services like YouTube and Gmail all rely on servers running Linux. It also powers Amazon and Facebook, and is a fixture in  cloud computing services.\n It isn&#39;t clear if Linux kernel leaders will accommodate Rust. Linus Torvalds, the founder of Linux, has said he&#39;s  open to change if  Rust for Linux champions prove its worth. Ojeda has proposed 13  changes needed to allow Rust modules in Linux to get things started.\n Google already has taken some early steps to make it possible to  use Rust for Linux Android. Getting buy-in at the highest levels of the Linux kernel project means many other software projects could benefit, too.\n Google credits the Linux community programmers who began the Rust for Linux project. &#34;The community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system,&#34; Google said in a blog post.\n  Rust, which was developed by Firefox maker  Mozilla and is now run by the independent  Rust Foundation, makes it safer for software to write to memory.  Hackers can exploit memory problems, hiding malicious extra code in out-of-bounds memory areas. Rust checks for those and other problems when programmers are building their software. And it&#39;s been the  most loved programming language for five years running in Stack Overflow&#39;s annual developer survey.\n &#34;Rust represents the  best alternative to C and C++ currently available,&#34; Microsoft&#39;s security team concluded in 2019. The team said Rust would have prevented memory problems at fault in 70% of its significant security issues. And because Rust&#39;s checks happen while software is being built, the safety doesn&#39;t come at the expense of performance when the software is running.\n The goal of the Linux on Rust project isn&#39;t to replace all of Linux&#39;s C code but rather to improve selective and new parts.\n &#34;For the foreseeable future we plan to focus on certain security critical components and drivers,&#34; said Josh Aas, who runs ISRG&#39;s Prossimo project to move critical Internet software to memory safe software. Drivers are operating systems modules that control specific devices like printers, network adapters and graphics chips.\n Google isn&#39;t placing its only bets on Linux and Rust.

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard&#39;s podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\n  Last week  Motherboard revealed that hackers stole a wealth of data from game publishing giant Electronic Arts, including source code for the Frostbite engine and  FIFA 21 game. The hackers said they did this, in part, by purchasing a cookie for $10 that let them  log into an EA Slack account, and then tricking EA&#39;s IT support into granting access to the company&#39;s internal network.\n  Now, a representative for the hackers has told Motherboard where they allegedly bought that cookie: Genesis Market, an invite-only underground site where cybercriminals can source cookies that have been lifted from hacked computers for a cornucopia of services.\n    &#34;Can filter for sale by URL,&#34; the representative of the EA hackers said in an online chat, specifying that criminals can search for domains such as Slack or Okta, a popular cybersecurity and sign-in service designed to make access to company assets more secure.\n   Have you used data from Genesis Market in a hack? Do you know anything else about the site? We\u2019d love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on\u00a0  jfcox@jabber.ccc.de, or email\u00a0joseph.cox@vice.com.\n  A  handful of  cybersecurity companies  and trade publications have covered the site in the past few years. But its alleged link to a high profile breach demonstrates its increasing relevance in the digital underground.\n  Cookies are small files stored on your computer that can hold all sorts of information. Sometimes they can be used by advertising firms to track browsing activity from site to site; other times they&#39;re used for storing login details and keeping you logged into different websites. On Genesis, criminals don&#39;t just buy one cookie; they buy exclusive access to a &#34;bot,&#34; a compromised computer that is part of a botnet which could contain any number of login details. But more importantly, Genesis also lets customers essentially recreate a one-to-one replica of that victim&#39;s browser, with their cookies and device fingerprints intact.\n    &#34;Someone is essentially getting a perfect mask of you,&#34; Matthew Gracey-McMinn, head of threat research at cybersecurity firm Netacea which has investigated Genesis, told Motherboard. In some cases, using data bought from Genesis could let a hacker bypass two-factor authentication, because the logged in service may not prompt a user who appears legitimate for the extra code from their phone, for example. In the website&#39;s eyes, whoever is logging in is using an already known device.\n  This sort of data makes a hacker and the victim &#34;pretty much indistinguishable,&#34; Gracey-McMinn added.\n   Whereas bots are often used for re-routing a hacker&#39;s traffic to make it harder for law enforcement to identify their location, or carry out distributed denial of service attacks, Genesis has presented an opportunity to diversify a botnet owner&#39;s income stream, Gracey-McMinn said.\n  &#34;We&#39;re on these computers, we can see everything happening on them. Why don&#39;t we exfiltrate that data as it comes in\u2014login credentials, browser fingerprints, the whole works,&#34; Gracey-McMinn said.\n  When selecting a bot to purchase, Genesis shows a user what particular sites are included, according to screenshots and videos shared by Gracey-McMinn and Dan Woods from cybersecurity firm F5 which has also tracked Genesis. One bot for sale had 5,000 cookies linked to it across multiple web browsers, and included sites as diverse as Facebook, Spotify, Reddit, Pinterest, Apple, Netflix, Binance, GitHub, Steam, Instagram, Adobe, Amazon, Google, Tumblr, Twitter, Dropbox, PayPal, LinkedIn, NvidiaStore, EANetwork, and Slack.\n    Both Gracey-McMinn and Woods said that a search for bots across the marketplace mentioning Slack returned over 3,500 results. The number of listings overall has grown substantially, with nearly 400,000 listings available, both researchers showed Motherboard.\n  The site itself provides a slick, self-service interface for users. Woods showed Motherboard customer support communications he had with the site administrators while using the marketplace. The responses were in perfect English.\n   After buying a bot, hackers can simply take the exposed login details included in cookies such as email addresses and passwords and access the relevant sites. Or, they can use a browser plugin that Genesis offers which lets the hackers use the exposed information to mimic the victim on a much more convincing level. Here, Genesis will create a configuration file\u2014the mask that Gracey-McMinn mentioned\u2014that the hackers then import into their own browser. The first file is free, but customers need to pay to generate new configuration files based on the cookies and browser information after that, screenshots showed.\n  And new data may keep flowing in. The customer doesn&#39;t necessarily just buy a bot, use the credentials, and move on. If whatever malware which is collecting the information is still active on the victim&#39;s machine, Genesis will update itself with that new data, and notify the user when it arrives.\n    &#34;If I&#39;ve bought early, I&#39;ve essentially got a great bargain. I could get something that would eventually be worth hundreds of dollars for 70 cents,&#34; Gracey-McMinn said.\n  Gracey-McMinn said they think Genesis is a single seller marketplace, with only one group of people selling information gleaned from malware. Woods believes that the creators of Genesis originally populated the marketplace with items collected with their own malware, and then allowed others to sell products too. One reason is that out of the hundreds of thousands of bots on the market, some of the bot names, a series of alphanumeric characters, have a constant substring in them.\n    Both researchers said they believe information from Genesis is being used in real-world attacks. Specifically Woods said F5 has reverse-engineered the Genesis plugin so it can observe when attackers use it against their customers.

And all this before we\u2019ve even reached the hottest part of the summer.\n  Among the 40 million Americans enduring the triple-digit temperatures are scientists who study droughts and the climate. They\u2019d long forewarned of this crisis, and now they\u2019re living through it. The Guardian spoke with researchers across the west about how they\u2019re coping.\n    I feel a little bit lucky because I\u2019m in Orange county, relatively close to the coast \u2013 so the temperatures are not as severe here as they are in other parts of California and the west. I\u2019m worried about this summer \u2013 this doesn\u2019t bode well, in terms of what we can expect with wildfire and the worsening drought. This current drought is potentially on track to become the worst that we\u2019ve seen in at least 1,200 years. And the reason is linked directly to human caused climate change.\n As a paleoclimatologist my main point, always, is that we are able to look into the past. By looking at tree rings and other paleoclimate records, we\u2019re able to gain really important perspectives about how climate has varied and changed in the past. And having done that, it\u2019s clear that what we\u2019re experiencing now is not natural. This is undoubtedly being caused by human activities, by greenhouse gas emissions.\n The more we see these extreme events, piled on top of each other, and not just in the western US but globally, the more I think the reality of climate change becomes inescapable. And it feels absolutely overwhelming and sad. We are going to have less water, increased wildfires and more extreme heatwaves. But it\u2019s also motivating. We need to continue to push for urgent action on climate change\n    This is really, really bad. Here on the eastern side of the Rockies, here in Boulder, we\u2019re seeing record high temperatures. That\u2019s the case in other parts of the state and in other states. And we\u2019re seeing smoke plumes \u2013 not from local fires but from fires in Arizona and Utah. I think for a lot of people, it\u2019s traumatic. The fires we saw in the last couple of years were really awful, and this year it seems like we\u2019re on that same trajectory. It kind of feels like deja vu.\n It does get rough sometime \u2013 talking about these things year after year. I live in the west, and all my family, pretty much, lives in the west. Most of my friends live in the west. It\u2019s where I grew up, and seeing the landscape-scale transformations that are happening here, and seeing how it\u2019s affecting people is overwhelming sometimes. But actually to me, the most distressing part is that this is very much in line with predictions. Climate scientists have been repeating essentially the same messages and warnings since before I was born.\n Climate change is a major contributor to, if not the dominant factor, in a lot of the changes that we\u2019re seeing out west and elsewhere. And it just is going to keep getting worse unless we do something about it. And so far, you know, we have yet to do the kinds of things, on a large enough scale, that are actually going to make a meaningful difference.\n The atmospheric scientist: \u2018It\u2019s surreal to see your models become real life\u2019\n   The extreme heat and the wildfires aren\u2019t surprising. But it is just surreal to see what you only ever saw before in your research studies and models, actually happening in real life. And you\u2019re almost dumbfounded by the speed at which your projections have become reality.\n Climate change is loading the weather dice against us. We always have a chance of rolling a double six naturally, and getting an intense record breaking summer heatwave. But decade by decade as the world warms, it\u2019s as if climate change is sneaking in and taking one of those numbers on the dice and turning it into another six, and then another six. And maybe even a seven. So we are seeing that heatwaves are coming earlier in the year, they are longer, they are stronger.\n Still, public opinion data shows that there\u2019s a disconnect, where even though about 72% of people in the US say global warming is happening, only 40% say that they think that it will affect them directly. But we actually did a  recent study, looking at climate and weather extremes \u2013 and we found that really hot, dry conditions are the only thing that most people in the US directly connect to climate change. So right now is a really important time for scientists to communicate with the public that climate change is here, and climate action matters.\n    Yesterday, when Salt Lake City hit record temperatures, we went to one of our grad students\u2019 back yards to barbecue some burgers and do some work. But it was so hot \u2013 oh my gosh, 107F (42C). So hot that, actually three out of five students\u2019 computers overheated and broke. I was the first to throw in the white flag and ask to go home \u2013 I really hurting.\n As a meteorologist, of course this isn\u2019t a surprise. The warming climate is making these dry, hot periods even drier and hotter. Since we\u2019re in a drought, we don\u2019t really have much moisture in the soil. And without that moisture, the sun really heats up the ground and the air much faster. So, really what we\u2019re seeing in the south-west is, the ground is burning like a hotplate. And we\u2019re standing on it.\n But you know, I actually feel kind of optimistic. In the restaurants and beer houses right now, everybody is talking about the weather, and how hot it is. And a few of them will even comment, \u201cThis is the new normal.\u201d And I mean \u2013 we\u2019re in Utah! Whatever people believe in, they know it\u2019s really hot, and the climate is changing \u2013 and they don\u2019t like that. These compounding extreme weather events are really bad \u2013 but they\u2019re going to keep happening, no matter what. Maybe if there\u2019s some good to come out of it, it\u2019s that people are becoming more aware. And the sooner the general public starts to become aware of this issue, the sooner, hopefully, they\u2019ll push for changes to address the crisis. So actually, if you saw me walking around outside this week, I probably had a smile on my face as I listened to some of these conversations.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:47:56", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Twenty miles south of Cairo, on the Nile&#39;s west bank, where riverfed crop fields give way to desert, the ancient site of Saqqara is marked by crumbling pyramids that emerge from the sand like dragon&#39;s teeth. Most striking is the famous Step Pyramid, built in the 27th century B.C. by Djoser, the Old Kingdom pharaoh who launched the tradition of constructing pyramids as monumental royal tombs. More than a dozen other pyramids are scattered along the five-mile strip of land, which is also dotted with the remains of temples, tombs and walkways that, together, span the entire history of ancient Egypt. But beneath the ground is far more\u2014a vast and extraordinary netherworld of treasures.\n        One scorching day last fall, Mohammad Youssef, an archaeologist, clung to a rope inside a shaft that had been closed for more than 2,000 years. At the bottom, he shined his flashlight through a gap in the limestone wall and was greeted by a god\u2019s gleaming eyes: a small, painted statue of the composite funerary deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, with a golden face and plumed crown. It was Youssef\u2019s first glimpse of a large chamber that was guarded by a heap of figurines, carved wooden chests and piles of blackened linen. Inside, Youssef and his colleagues found signs that the people buried here had wealth and privilege: gilded masks, a finely carved falcon and a painted scarab beetle rolling the sun across the sky. Yet this was no luxurious family tomb, as might have been expected. Instead, the archaeologists were astonished to discover dozens of expensive coffins jammed together, piled to the ceiling as if in a warehouse. Beautifully painted, human-shaped boxes were stacked roughly on top of heavy limestone sarcophagi. Gilded coffins were packed into niches around the walls. The floor itself was covered in rags and bones.\n  This eerie chamber is one of several \u201cmegatombs,\u201d as the archaeologists describe them, discovered last year at Saqqara, the sprawling necropolis that once served the nearby Egyptian capital of Memphis. The excavators overseen by Youssef uncovered hundreds of coffins, mummies and grave goods, including carved statues and mummified cats, packed into several shafts, all untouched since antiquity. The trove includes many individual works of art, from the gilded portrait mask of a sixth- or seventh-century B.C. noblewoman to a bronze figure of the god Nefertem inlaid with precious gems. The scale of discoveries\u2014captured in the  Smithsonian Channel documentary series  \u201cTomb Hunters,\u201d an advance copy of which was made available to me\u2014has excited archaeologists. They say it opens a window into a period late in ancient Egyptian history when Saqqara was at the center of a national revival in pharaonic culture and attracted visitors from across the known world. The site is full of contradictions, entwining past and future, spirituality and economics. It was a hive of ritual and magic that arguably couldn\u2019t seem more distant from our modern world. Yet it nurtured ideas so powerful they still shape our lives today.\n    Travelers visiting Egypt have long marveled at the vestiges of the pharaohs\u2019 lost world\u2014the great pyramids, ancient temples and mysterious writings carved into stone. But Egyptology, the formal study of ancient Egyptian civilization, didn\u2019t begin in earnest until Napoleon Bonaparte invaded at the turn of the 19th century and French scholars collected detailed records of ancient sites and scoured the country for antiquities. When Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion deciphered hieroglyphs, in the 1820s, the history of one of humanity\u2019s great civilizations could finally be read, and European scholars and enthusiasts flocked to see not only the pyramids at Giza but also the colossal Ramses II statues carved into the cliffs at Abu Simbel and the royal tombs in Luxor\u2019s Valley of the Kings.\n    Apart from its eroding pyramids, Saqqara was known, by contrast, for its subterranean caverns, which locals raided for mummies to use as fertilizer and tourists ransacked for souvenirs. Looters carted off not only mummified people but also mummified animals\u2014hawks, ibises, baboons. Saqqara didn\u2019t attract much archaeological attention until the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who became the first director of Egypt\u2019s Antiquities Service, visited in 1850. He declared the site \u201ca spectacle of utter devastation,\u201d with yawning pits and dismantled brick walls where the sand was mixed with mummy wrappings and bones. But he also noticed the half-buried statue of a sphinx, and probing further he found a sphinx-lined avenue leading to a temple called the Serapeum. Beneath the temple were tunnels that held the coffins of Apis bulls, worshiped as incarnations of Ptah and Osiris.\n  Since then, excavations have revealed a history of burials and cult ceremonies spanning more than 3,000 years, from Egypt\u2019s earliest pharaohs to its dying breaths in the Roman era. Yet Saqqara has remained overshadowed by the glamour of Luxor to the south, where in the second millennium B.C. pharaohs covered the walls of their tombs with depictions of the afterlife, and the Great Pyramids just miles to the north.\n    It certainly took a while for Mostafa Waziri, the archaeologist directing the latest project, to be converted to Saqqara\u2019s charms. He spent most of his career excavating in Luxor, but in 2017 he was appointed director of  Egypt\u2019s Supreme Council of Antiquities (making him, among other things, a successor to Mariette). The new job entailed a move to Cairo. Continuing to dig in southern Egypt was therefore no longer practical, he says, but on his doorstep was another great opportunity: \u201cI realized it was less than one hour from my office to Saqqara!\u201d\n  Working with an Egyptian team, including Youssef, the site director, Waziri chose to excavate near a mysterious temple called the Bubasteion, dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet, that had been cut into limestone cliffs near the site\u2019s eastern boundary around 600 B.C. A group of French archaeologists had worked nearby for decades, where they found, among other discoveries, the 14th-century B.C. tomb of King Tutankhamen\u2019s wet nurse, Maia. But Waziri targeted an area that the French team had used to pile the debris from their excavations, calculating that whatever lay beneath it had remained untouched.\n    His approach paid off. In December 2018, Waziri announced the discovery of a 4,400-year-old tomb, intact and ornately carved, that belonged to a high-ranking priest named Wahtye. The next season yielded intriguing caches of animal mummies\u2014not just cats but a cobra, a lion cub, a mongoose and even a scarab beetle. Then, in September 2020, the team unearthed a vertical shaft dug 30 feet down into the bedrock, the first of the \u201cmegatombs.\u201d In separate niches at the bottom were two giant coffins, and when the archaeologists cleared the surrounding debris they found dozens more. \u201cI had to call the [antiquities] minister,\u201d says Waziri. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How many?\u2019\u201d Eighteen months later, Waziri is still counting.\n    In a simple conservation lab set up at the site, Youssef and his colleagues admired the first coffin to be removed from the shaft. Sealed with black resin, it was roughly human-shaped but huge and squat\u2014more than 7.5 feet long and 3 feet wide\u2014with a wide, impassive face. Removing the intricately carved wooden lid revealed a glint of gold: A second coffin was nested inside, complete with gilded mask. Beautifully preserved, it showed the face of a woman with large, kohl-lined eyes. The rest of the inner coffin was intricately painted in blue, green and red, and included flower and leaf motifs and a depiction of the sky goddess, Nut, with outstretched wings. Most exciting, though, were the hieroglyphs, because they provided valuable information about the occupant: not just spells to aid her journey to the afterlife but details of her family, as well as her name: Ta-Gemi-En-Aset.\n    These details and the distinctive style of the coffin indicate that she lived during the sixth or seventh century B.C., at the start of Egypt\u2019s Late Period, when a pharaoh named Psamtik I reunified the country after a period of instability and foreign invasions. Egypt was strong and prosperous once again, a global power alongside Babylon and Persia. Psamtik also revived the powerful city of Memphis, then home to around two million people, and nearby Saqqara to hold its dead. According to Campbell Price, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the Manchester Museum in England, the name Ta-Gemi-En-Aset means \u201cshe who was found by Isis.\u201d The coffin inscriptions describe her mother as a singer, and include a symbol representing a sistrum, a musical rattle used in temples. Price suggests that Ta-Gemi may have belonged to the cult of Isis, and perhaps played a role in rituals and festivals in a nearby temple devoted to the goddess.\n  The second coffin retrieved from the shaft was similar to Ta-Gemi\u2019s, and it also contained an inner coffin with a gilded mask. This time, the portrait mask showed a bearded man named Psamtik (probably in honor of one of several pharaohs of this period who shared the name). At first, the team wondered whether Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were related. The hieroglyphs revealed that their fathers had the same name: Horus. But their mothers\u2019 names were different, and further discoveries revealed a different picture.\n    The team dug deeper, a painfully slow process that involved the help of local laborers, who scooped out the sand by hand and hauled basketsful of debris to the surface using a traditional wooden winch called a  tambora, the design of which hasn\u2019t changed in centuries. Below Psamtik\u2019s burial niche was a room filled with many additional coffins, covered in rubble and damaged by ancient rockfalls. The bottom of the shaft led to a second, even bigger cavern, inside of which were jammed more than a hundred coffins of different styles and sizes. There were also loose grave goods, including  ushabtis, miniature figures intended as servants in the afterlife, and hundreds of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statuettes. There were even coffins buried in the base of the shaft itself, as if whoever put them there was running out of space. The result was a megatomb described by the research team as the largest concentration of coffins ever unearthed in Egypt.\n              Great collections of mummies and coffins have been found before, but never grouped so densely together. This was mass burial on an astonishing scale, and it shines a light on Egyptian culture at a moment of transition. In the Old Kingdom, in the third millennium B.C.\u2014Djoser\u2019s time\u2014the elites appear to have favored private family spaces such as the priest Wahtye\u2019s rock-cut tomb, which included an ornate, above-ground chapel for visitors lined with painted reliefs, inscriptions and statues of Wahtye himself. Burial shafts dug into the floor of such tombs were dedicated to particular family members. By the Late Period, some 2,000 years later, well-to-do Egyptians such as Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were packed into tight, shared spaces like cheap crates. Why did people who could clearly afford expensive coffins settle for such a crowded resting place?\n  According to Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, in England, they did so in part because by then the practice was simply routine. Shared tombs became popular across Egypt around 1000 B.C., driven by economic necessity as the kingdom faced a period of instability and collapse. When Psamtik I restored order in the seventh century B.C., the practice stuck. \u201cWe know that from the Late Period, that\u2019s how burials are done,\u201d Dodson says.\n    Campbell Price, of the  Manchester Museum, adds that the answer also has to do with Saqqara\u2019s pyramids. The necropolis had always been a center for religious cults, from the time high-ranking Egyptians were first buried there, often in low, flat-roofed tombs called  mastabas, and probably long before. To help bring the country together after turbulent times, Psamtik encouraged a revival of traditional rituals and belief; after a long period as a backwater, Saqqara exploded again in popularity. Far more than a local cemetery, says Price, it became a pilgrimage site, \u201clike an ancient Mecca or Lourdes,\u201d attracting visitors not just from Egypt but from all over the eastern Mediterranean. Buildings such as the Step Pyramid were already thousands of years old at this time, and people believed their creators, such as Djoser and his architect Imhotep, were gods themselves. Cults and temples sprang up. Pilgrims would bring offerings, and they vied for burial spaces for themselves and their families near the ancient, sacred tombs. \u201cSaqqara would have been the place to be seen dead in,\u201d says Price. \u201cIt had this numinous, divine energy that would help you get into the afterlife.\u201d\n    That created conditions for a thriving commercial operation entwined with the spiritual one, resulting in a kind of real estate market for the dead. \u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d says Dodson. There was probably a sliding scale of options available. Senior officials and military officers were interred in large tombs near the Old Kingdom pyramids of Unas and Userkaf, for example, while the poorest in society were probably buried \u201cin the desert in a sheet.\u201d But the wealthy middle classes appear to have opted for a shared shaft, perhaps with a private niche if they could afford it, or were simply piled with others on the floor. If you wanted to be close to the magical energy of Saqqara\u2019s gods and festivals, Dodson says, \u201cyou bought yourself a space in a shaft.\u201d\n    The supersized burials unearthed by Waziri\u2019s archaeology team reveal how intense the desire for particular locations became\u2014and how profitable they were. Instead of digging new tombs, the priests in charge of burials reused older shafts, expanding them and, Price and Dodson suggest, cramming in as many coffins as they could. The cliffs of the Bubasteion, overlooking the landscape and close to the main processional route, may have been one of the most sought-after spots of all.\n    Last October, the archaeologists found a new shaft beneath the ruins of the Bubasteion\u2014the chaotic, painted chamber illuminated by Youssef\u2019s flashlight. It was another megatomb, bursting with some of the finest coffins and mummies yet discovered, as well as grave goods including a falcon-topped wooden box (possibly a canopic chest, used to store internal organs removed during mummification) and numerous painted Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statues, one of which contained seeds of corn, a symbol of rebirth.\n    Many of the burials date later than the other finds at Saqqara, to the era of Greek rule in Egypt following the Late Period, after Ptolemy, one of Alexander the Great\u2019s top generals, founded a new dynasty of pharaohs in 305 B.C. With the Ptolemaic pharaohs came strong Greek cultural influences, particularly at the Mediterranean capital of Alexandria, home to some of the finest scholars of the Hellenistic world, such as the mathematician Euclid and the physician-anatomist Herophilus. Hundreds of thousands of migrants from across the Greek world settled elsewhere in Egypt, and many were awarded plots of land. Public life was Greek-run, but in private life, including religious worship, there was considerable freedom, and many of the new arrivals appear to have adopted Egyptian beliefs and customs, including mummification. As time went on, says Dodson, \u201cmore people who self-identified as Greeks were being buried according to Egyptian customs.\u201d Saqqara was as busy as ever, and the new discoveries suggest the priests were still squeezing as many bodies as possible into the shafts.\n        In a nearby shaft, the team unearthed cat mummies along with human remains. Previous excavations had discovered a huge cat necropolis at the Bubasteion, where the animals, sacred to the feline goddess Bastet, were embalmed and left as offerings. It was one of many local animal cults. Just north of the Bubasteion is the Anubieion, a temple complex dedicated to the jackal-headed god of death, Anubis, where mazelike tunnels are estimated to have held millions of mummified dogs. Beyond that are catacombs once filled with mummified ibises, hawks and baboons. To the west is the Serapeum, where Apis bulls were laid to rest.\n      These cults always existed at Saqqara. Their roots stretch back to predynastic times, and they thrived especially in the Late Period, during the renaissance inaugurated by Psamtik, perhaps because they were seen as archetypally Egyptian, says Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist based at the  American University in Cairo\u2014a symbol of national identity when foreign influence was an ever-present threat. But they became even more popular under the Greeks, with millions of animals bred to order, presumably on nearby farms, and often sacrificed shortly after birth. Waziri and his colleagues found animal mummies of varying qualities, which were probably priced accordingly. X-rays reveal that some \u201cmummies\u201d have no cat remains inside at all. And the mix with human bones suggests that if priests ran out of space in the dedicated animal catacombs, they simply commandeered older human tombs. The animal cults, in other words, became an ever more significant economic and spiritual force, helping to drive Saqqara\u2019s final flourish. Or as Price puts it: \u201cSaqqara was like an enormous, divine magnet or battery, powered by all these animal mummies.\u201d\n  To the Greeks, part of the appeal of such Egyptian customs may have been the ease of making a personal plea to the gods, by visiting a stall selling mummified animals and choosing from a range of prepared products on offer. And the reward would likewise have been appealing: the promise, unique to Egyptian theology at that time, of an eternal afterlife of splendor. By contrast, \u201cGreek ideas for the afterlife were pretty dull,\u201d says Price. In classic Greek literature, for example, the dead were mere shadows inhabiting a dark underworld. The Babylonian and Jewish traditions had very exclusive notions of heaven; eternal life was reserved for the gods. But Egyptian texts covering the walls inside the Saqqara pyramids describe the king\u2019s soul rising up after death to join the sun in the sky. By around 2000 B.C., resurrection spells were written onto coffins directly, enabling even ordinary citizens such as Ta-Gemi to make the journey to idyllic, golden fields. Although the details of the afterlife changed over time, the most desirable postmortem destination during the Ptolemaic period was the \u201cField of Reeds,\u201d an agricultural paradise with unfailing harvests and eternal spring.\n      After Cleopatra ended her life in 30 B.C., bringing the Ptolemaic era to an end, Rome ruled Egypt. Whereas the Greeks had integrated into Egyptian culture, the Romans remade it, imposing their laws and administrative systems and, in time, their newly adopted Christian faith. At Saqqara, the last Egyptian mummies date to the third century A.D. Despite the cultural triumph of Rome, however, some Egyptian iconography lives on in Christian narratives. Many scholars have noted similarities between Egyptian and Christian religious symbolism, for example in stories of the goddess Isis and her son Horus and the Virgin Mary and her son Jesus. \u201cA lot of the iconography in Christianity is derived from ancient Egypt,\u201d says Ikram, of the American University in Cairo.\n    Which is not to say that these images were necessarily appropriated directly; rather, in antiquity these influences ran in many directions. The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, of Oxford, notes that Christian ideas of the afterlife in particular drew heavily on Greek belief, which by then had developed a \u201cvocabulary\u201d for concepts such as Plato\u2019s notion that the human soul \u201cmight reflect a divine force beyond itself.\u201d Plato, for his part, was influenced by Pythagoras, who is thought to have studied in Egypt in the sixth century B.C. \u201cBy the time Chris\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:47:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "saqqara,tombs,\u57c3\u53ca", "title": "\u5728Saqqara\u7684\u575f\u5893\u91cc\u9762 ", "title_en": "Inside The Tombs of Saqqara", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/inside-tombs-saqqara-180977932/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["saqqara", "tombs", "\u57c3\u53ca"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066924, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u7ec8\u6b62\u7ec8\u6b62\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5bf9\u4e8eC\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7410\u788e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136C\u578b\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u590d\u5236\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u51fd\u6570\u58f0\u79f0\u5728C.\u8f76\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u6e34\u671b\u5177\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u590d\u5236\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\n \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6574\u6570\u3002\n  \u8fd4\u56de\u540e\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u65f6\uff08\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u5668\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u5927\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u672a\u7ecf\u672a\u52ff\u7ed2\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6307\u5411\u5305\u542b\u6e90\u6781\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u3002 \uff08\u867d\u7136\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56de\u529b\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u6307\u793a\u5b83\u4ece\u6e90\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u793a\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002 \uff08\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u5141\u8bb8\u5904\u7406\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u8bfb\u53d6\u6216\u5199\u5165\u5b83\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u643a\u624b\u5408\u4f5c\uff1a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5199\u5165NUL\u5b57\u8282IT\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ece\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u8bfb\u53d6\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u786e\u5b9a\u5b83\u5df2\u586b\u5145\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u662f\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\uff08\u653e\u5bbd\u4e00\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff09\u3002\n  \u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u7b26\u5408ISO C\u6216POSIX.1\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6700\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u3002\n \u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8c03\u7528strxcpy\uff1a \nchar * strxcpy\uff08char *\u9650\u5236dst\uff0cconst char *\u9650\u5236src\uff0csize_t len\uff09{if\uff08\uff01len\uff09{return null; } whiled\uff08 -

While C-style strings are a fundamental part of using the language, manipulating them is a common source of security bugs and lost performance. One of the most common operations is copying a string from one buffer to another, and there are a variety of string functions that claim to do this in C. Anecdotally, however, there is much confusion about what they actually do, and many people desire a string copying function with the following properties:\n The function should accept a null-terminated source string, a destination buffer, and an integer representing the size of the destination buffer.\n  Upon return the function should ensure that the destination buffer points to a null-terminated string containing a prefix of the source string when possible (specifically, when the destination buffer has a non-zero size) to avoid issues in the future with unterminated strings. (While string truncation has its own issues, it is often a fairly reasonable fallback.)\n  The function should indicate how many characters it copied from the source, as well as indicate if an overflow occurred. (This allows for dealing with the overflow, if desired.)\n  The function should be efficient, and it should not read or write memory that it does not have to. These go partially hand-in-hand: the function should run in a single pass, not write to the destination buffer past the NUL byte it places, or read characters from the source string once it\u2019s determined that it has filled the destination buffer. Ideally, the implementation would be vectorizable (relaxing some of the previous constraints slightly to within platform alignment guarantees).\n  The function should be standardized, so that it may be used portably across systems. Conformance to  ISO C or  POSIX.1 are generally the most desirable.\n That is, what is often necessary is the function below, which we\u2019ll call  strxcpy:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t return  NULL ;\t }\t while  ( -- len  &amp;&amp;  ( * dst ++  =  * src ++ ))\t\t ;\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t * dst ++  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t\t return  * src  ?  NULL  :  dst ;\t }  else  {\t\t return  dst ;\t } }\n Other than standardization, this function will copy the smaller of  strlen(src) or  len - 1 bytes from  src to  dst and cap the copy with a NUL character. In the case where  src fits in  dst, it will return a pointer past the NUL byte it placed; otherwise it returns  NULL to indicate a truncation. While  current  compilers seem to have trouble with its control flow, it should also be fairly straightforwards to vectorize, as the core loop is somewhat similar to a combination of  strncpy and  strlen.\n With guidance to look back to, let\u2019s take a look at a variety of copying routines and see if they can help us.\n To head off the usual concerns, we\u2019ll assume that we must use C, and that we will be eschewing the various length-prefixed or aggregate string constructions available as third-party libraries. While using a different language can solve many of the issues in C besides the one mentioned here; it\u2019s not always desirable or even possible to utilize them. In addition to the usual drawbacks to using third-party libraries, replacing null-terminated strings often causes added syntactical overhead and incompatibilities with other code that has been designed to work with them.\n   The standard  strcpy function, which copies characters from  src to  dst, up to and including the first NUL byte encountered. If  dst is smaller than or aliases  src, then the behavior of the program is undefined.  dst is returned.\n strcpy certainly fulfills requirement 2 and parts of 4: it will always write out a null-terminated string and it\u2019ll do so quickly. However, it cannot perform bounds checks at all, so we can only use it if we know our destination buffer is smaller than our source buffer\u2013it fails requirement 1. Plus it doesn\u2019t tell us how many characters it wrote, either\u2013that\u2019s requirement 3. It\u2019s been part of C forever, so it does meet requirement 5.\n  strncpy copies up to  len characters from  src to  dst. If  src is shorter than  len, then  dst is NUL-padded to  len characters.  dst is returned.\n strncpy takes the parameters we want, so it satisfies requirement 1; even in the face of an arbitrary source string it won\u2019t exhibit undefined behavior, provided that we supply it with the correct destination buffer length. However, if the source is longer that the destination, the buffer will not be null-terminated, and if it is shorter  strncpy will continue writing NUL bytes to the destination up to its size. In addition, it doesn\u2019t indicate how many characters from the source were written, though it is possible to detect overflow by writing a NUL byte to the last character of the destination buffer and checking it after the call. That means it fails requirements 2, 3, and 4, but as it\u2019s been around in C for as long as  strcpy it does meet requirement 5.\n   memcpy doesn\u2019t care about NUL characters at all; it doesn\u2019t even require the source to be a null-terminated string. It fails the first three requirements right off the bat, but it\u2019s part of C and it sure is fast so it meets requirements 4 and 5.\n  strcpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strcpy that performs the same operation and returns zero except it can write unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, and if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, it will write a NUL byte to  *dst if possible, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function.\n On the surface, this function  seems useful\u2013but a closer look shows that it has a number of unfortunate issues. The largest is that any truncation will call a constraint handler function which can do many things,  like abort the program. In addition, it doesn\u2019t tell us how much it wrote, can scribble over the destination, and is standardized but only available as an optional extension to C11. Overall, it only satisfies requirement 1.\n  strncpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strncpy, that returns a non-zero value if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, in which case it will write the NUL byte to  *dst if possible, unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function. Otherwise is will copy  len bytes from  src to  dst and then add a NUL terminating byte at  dst[len - 1], returning zero.\n This function has the same constraint handler issue as  strcpy_s, and is also standardized but often not available. While it will null-terminate when the string fits and only clobber the destination on an error, it still only satisfies the first requirement.\n  Identical to  strncpy, except that a pointer to the written NUL byte is returned, if any; otherwise  dst + len is returned.\n stpncpy is an improvement on  strncpy, but it only fixes the issue of detecting termination or overflow, which is requirement 3. It still fails requirement 2 because it doesn\u2019t necessarily null-terminate and it fails requirement 4 because it writes NULs to the end of the destination buffer. Unlike  strncpy it\u2019s part of POSIX, but it still meets requirement 5 in addition to requirement 1.\n  When used with  %s as  fmt, copies the first variadic parameter (a string) to  dst, or the first  len - 1 bytes followed by the NUL byte. Returns the length of the first variadic parameter.\n snprintf is a somewhat strange inclusion, but it\u2019s a standard function that can help us if we use \u201c%s\u201d as the format string, taking a size and null-terminating its destination. It fulfills requirements 1, 2, and 5, but falls short on 3 and 4: its return value is essentially \u201cwhat  sprintf would have returned\u201d, which means it must perform an equivalent of a  strlen at the very least. This is slow, not what we want, and an  int (not a  size_t).\n  Semantically equivalent to  sprintf(dst, len, &#34;%s&#34;, src) save for the return value, which is a  size_t.\n strlcpy is identical to the  sprintf invocation from before, except it uses the correct  size_t return type. This still means it fails to satisfy the performance requirements of 3 and 4, and it\u2019s not standard so it doesn\u2019t satisfy 5 either. Since it does the copy and leaves you with a null-terminated string it fills the first two requirements.\n  strscpy copies  src to  dst if it fits in the buffer and return the number of characters copied excluding the trailing NUL byte; otherwise it will copy the first  len - 1 characters and set  dst[len - 1] to a NUL byte, returning  -E2BIG.\n strscpy is the first function we\u2019ve seen that satisfies the four functional requirements: it copies the as much of the source string as possible, null terminates the destination buffer, returns the number of characters copied, and does not perform excessive reads or writes. In fact, we can implement our  strxcpy function using it:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t ssize_t  copied  =  strscpy ( dst ,  src ,  len );\t return  copied  !=  - E2BIG  :  src  +  copied  +  1  :  NULL ; }\n It has two issues: the first, is that it returns an  ssize_t rather than a  size_t, but in practice this isn\u2019t really a problem. The second is that it\u2019s unfortunately non-standard\u2013it\u2019s something the Linux kernel wrote for itself\u2013which means it violates requirement 5.\n  memccpy is identical to  memcpy, but may stop prematurely if  src contains  chr, copying  chr and returning pointer after its location in  dst. If  len characters are copied without encountering  chr, then  NULL is returned.\n memccpy, when used with the NUL character, satisfies all the requirements except for the second one, but this is trivial to fix:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t char  * end  =  memccpy ( dst ,  src ,  &#39;\\0&#39; ,  len );\t if  ( ! end )  {\t\t dst [ len  -  1 ]  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t }\t return  end ; }\n While it\u2019ll ship in an upcoming C standard, it\u2019s already widely available as a popular, optional POSIX extension.\n  There\u2019s a couple of other functions\u2013 stpcpy,  mempcpy,  sprintf,  sprintf_s, and  snprintf_s\u2013that have been omitted for brevity, as their behavior (and issues) are fairly self-explanatory based on the other functions. ( mempcpy is a GNU extension.)\n  Copying strings in C is an extremely common operation, but doing so safely and efficiently is non-trivial. Almost all currently available string routines, standardized or not, have subtle quirks that often prevent them from matching the expectations of the programmer who reaches for them. This issue is compounded by the fact that many style guides or linters will recommend the use of one (or sometimes more than one!) of these functions to replace  strcpy without discussing their limitations. Finally, as we saw above the functions compose quite poorly: our  strxcpy, an academic but not improbable scenario, could not use any of them in its implementation; one can only imagine that those writing an ad-hoc replacement for it may make both errors in doing so.\n In contrast, the standardization of  memccpy is a very welcome improvement, as it facilitates the construction of safer and more efficient string algorithms\u2013in addition to  strxcpy, a number of the functions discussed are  also easy to construct with it. As it becomes more widespread, most code that relies on some of the semantics of  strxcpy but uses one of the other functions to achieve it should probably migrate to  memccpy, and ideally the push to phase out the use of them will drive the standardization and adoption of many more widely applicable string functions.\n Questions?

The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials.\n    We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality, in secondary outcomes, and in chemoprophylaxis, among people with, or at high risk of, COVID-19 infection.\n    We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion.\n    Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19\u20130.73; n = 2438; I 2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian\u2013Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff\u2013Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%\u201391%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for \u201cneed for mechanical ventilation,\u201d whereas effect estimates for \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201cdeterioration\u201d clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty.

Although originally intended as a promotional tool to explain  free and open source software, the drink took on a life of its own and 150,000 cans were sold.  [2] The Toronto-based company Opencola became better known for the drink than the software it was supposed to promote. Laird Brown, the company&#39;s senior strategist, attributes its success to a widespread mistrust of big corporations and the &#34;proprietary nature of almost everything&#34;.  [3]\n        After mixing up the concentrate to the prescribed recipe (including all recommended safety precautions), the syrup is diluted 5:1 with (&#34;preferably  sodium-free&#34;)  soda water to make the finished drink; at this dilution, the above combination of ingredients will yield approximately 24 litres of OpenCola.\n The full recipe also includes instructions for home-made soda water produced from basic ingredients such as  yeast and  sugar in order to make the entire process open source; otherwise there would be a need to use commercially produced bottled or canned soda, or consumer  carbonation machines with commercially manufactured  carbon dioxide canisters.

It\u2019s easy to install, feels just like the real S3, and doesn\u2019t require any code changes.\n   Below is a pytest fixture that creates an S3 stub. Since other S3 clients won\u2019t use this stub, we also need to patch  get_s3 and replace its return value with the stub - thereby forcing all S3 clients in the Recipe class to use our stub.\n import  datetime import  json from  dateutil.tz  import  tzutc from  io  import  BytesIO from  unittest.mock  import  patch import  boto3 from  botocore.stub  import  Stubber ,  ANY from  botocore.response  import  StreamingBody import  pytest from  recipe  import  Recipe ,  S3_BUCKET @ pytest . fixture def  s3_stub ():  &#34;&#34;&#34;Pytest fixture that mocks the get_s3 function with a S3 client stub Yields a Stubber for the S3 client &#34;&#34;&#34;  s3  =  boto3 . client ( &#34;s3&#34; )  stubber  =  Stubber ( s3 )  with  patch ( &#34;recipe.get_s3&#34; ,  return_value = s3 ):  yield  stubber\n Then, we can stub out responses for the  put_object and  get_object S3 APIs. With those stubs in place, we can run the test that creates and subsequently fetches a Recipe.\n def  test_create_and_get ( s3_stub ):  # Stub out the put_object response  # Note: These stubs are incomplete - I omitted things such as  # HTTP headers for brevity  put_object_response  =  {  &#34;ResponseMetadata&#34; :  {  &#34;RequestId&#34; :  &#34;5994D680BF127CE3&#34; ,  &#34;HTTPStatusCode&#34; :  200 ,  &#34;RetryAttempts&#34; :  1 ,  },  &#34;ETag&#34; :  &#39;&#34;6299528715bad0e3510d1e4c4952ee7e&#34;&#39; ,  }  put_object_expected_params  =  { &#34;Bucket&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Key&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Body&#34; :  ANY }  s3_stub . add_response ( &#34;put_object&#34; ,  put_object_response ,  put_object_expected_params )  # Create the StreamingBody that will be returned by get_object  encoded_message  =  json . dumps (  { &#34;name&#34; :  &#34;nachos&#34; ,  &#34;instructions&#34; :  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; }  ). encode ( &#34;utf-8&#34; )  raw_stream  =  StreamingBody ( BytesIO ( encoded_message ),  len ( encoded_message ))  # Stub out the get_object response  get_object_response  =  {  &#34;ResponseMetadata&#34; :  {  &#34;RequestId&#34; :  &#34;6BFC00970E62BC8F&#34; ,  &#34;HTTPStatusCode&#34; :  200 ,  &#34;RetryAttempts&#34; :  1 ,  },  &#34;LastModified&#34; :  datetime . datetime ( 2020 ,  4 ,  6 ,  5 ,  39 ,  29 ,  tzinfo = tzutc ()),  &#34;ContentLength&#34; :  58 ,  &#34;ETag&#34; :  &#39;&#34;6299528715bad0e3510d1e4c4952ee7e&#34;&#39; ,  &#34;ContentType&#34; :  &#34;binary/octet-stream&#34; ,  &#34;Metadata&#34; :  {},  &#34;Body&#34; :  raw_stream ,  }  get_object_expected_params  =  { &#34;Bucket&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Key&#34; :  ANY }  s3_stub . add_response ( &#34;get_object&#34; ,  get_object_response ,  get_object_expected_params )  # Activate the stubber  with  s3_stub :  recipe  =  Recipe ( name = &#34;nachos&#34; ,  instructions = &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; )  recipe . save ()  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;nachos&#34; )  assert  recipe . name  ==  &#34;nachos&#34;  assert  recipe . instructions  ==  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34;\n While botocore stubs are functional, I don\u2019t like working with them for several reasons:\n They require a lot more prep. Creating stubs is time-consuming. Even if you run the real code interactively and copy the response, some things need to be replaced - such as the StreamingBody above.\n  They\u2019re fragile and fake. Responses are returned first in, first out - so if you call the S3 APIs in a different order than you added the responses, it will throw an error. If you have a bug in how you call the API, it might not be caught.\n  To make the stubs look somewhat realistic, you have to mock many fields that your code doesn\u2019t care about and bloat your tests with fake responses.\n  They leak implementation details from the module being tested. For example, if a module switched from using  s3.list_objects to  s3.list_objects_v2, the test would fail because it depends on a specific API being called. This creates an unnecessary dependency on the private API of the module, instead of testing the public API.\n  A third option is  localstack, which allows you to bring up an entire AWS cloud stack locally.\n  version :  &#34; 3.7&#34; services :  tests :  image :  s3_testing:latest  networks :  -  app  entrypoint :  -  /app/wait-for-it.sh  -  -t  -  &#34; 30&#34;  -  localstack:4572  -  --  -  pytest  -  test/  environment :  -  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=fake  -  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=fake  -  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=fake  localstack :  image :  localstack/localstack  ports :  -  &#34; 4566-4599:4566-4599&#34;  networks :  -  app  environment :  -  SERVICES=s3 networks :  app :  driver :  bridge\n Next, we mock  get_s3 again and this time replace it with an S3 client that is connected to localstack.\n from  unittest.mock  import  patch import  boto3 import  pytest from  recipe  import  Recipe ,  S3_BUCKET @ pytest . fixture def  s3_localstack ():  s3  =  boto3 . client ( &#34;s3&#34; ,  endpoint_url = &#34;http://localstack:4572&#34; )  s3 . create_bucket ( Bucket = S3_BUCKET )  with  patch ( &#34;recipe.get_s3&#34; ,  return_value = s3 ):  yield  s3\n With this mock in place, we can run the same tests that we ran with moto.\n def  test_create_and_get ( s3_localstack ):  Recipe ( name = &#34;nachos&#34; ,  instructions = &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; ). save ()  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;nachos&#34; )  assert  recipe . name  ==  &#34;nachos&#34;  assert  recipe . instructions  ==  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; def  test_get_does_not_exist ( s3_localstack ):  with  pytest . raises ( s3_localstack . exceptions . NoSuchKey ):  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;sandwich&#34; )\n Localstack is extremely easy to use, but it takes almost 30 seconds to spin up on my machine.\n  Both moto and localstack are very powerful and easy to work with. Both solutions do a good job of implementing the S3 API, and they also support other AWS services including EC2, RDS, Lambda, and more. They can both be used to test code in other languages in addition to Python.\n Localstack is probably the closest thing to actually connecting to AWS, but for my simple use case presented above, I can\u2019t justify the extra overhead and time required to spin up the stack. Therefore, I recommend moto as it\u2019s the most lightweight solution that properly implements the S3 API.\n For more complicated projects that are testing S3 performance, localstack could be a good choice. Botocore stubs don\u2019t make the cut.\n  Thanks for reading!

But the way that government statisticians track the price of consumer goods may be missing just how explosive home-price growth has been in recent months.\n  Housing costs rose by 0.4% between April and May, according to  the latest edition of the monthly consumer price index released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Compared with last year, housing prices for renters and homeowners alike were up 2.2%.\n  Altogether, the rise in housing prices  accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May, a reflection of how heavily government economists weight this spending category.\n  But if that 2.2% figure seems off based on your own experience of buying or selling a home, it\u2019s not a surprise. Not everyone agrees on the rate of house-price growth.\n    Other data suggested a much faster pace of home price appreciation and rental growth, well in excess of that level.\n  The  most recent report from the Case-Shiller Home Price Index for March showed that home prices were up more than 13%, the largest rate of growth since 2005.\n  So how does the CPI calculate housing? Firstly, housing units themselves are not included the CPI market basket.\n  Secondly, rental data to establish how prices are changing are collected every six months. The calculations for most other CPI items are collected monthly or bimonthly.\n  \u201cLike most other economic series, the CPI views housing units as capital (or investment) goods and not as consumption items,\u201d  the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. \u201cSpending to purchase and improve houses and other housing units is investment and not consumption.\u201d\n  \u201cThe cost of shelter for renter-occupied housing is rent. For an owner-occupied unit, the cost of shelter is the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes,\u201d it adds.\n   The government pollsters ask homeowners: \u201cIf someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?\u201d\n  And they ask renters: \u201cWhat is the rental charge to your [household] for this unit including any extra charges for garage and parking facilities? Do not include direct payments by local, state or federal agencies. What period of time does this cover?\u201d\n   \u201cThe rate of house price appreciation is not akin to inflation,\u201d said Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurance company First American Financial Services  FAF.\n  For a start, housing is a very basic necessity. \u201cDemand for shelter doesn\u2019t go away \u2014 it just moves around,\u201d Fleming said. In other words, if the price of airfares skyrockets 7%, as it did over the past month, families could decide against going on that summer getaway.\n  That choice isn\u2019t so simple when it comes to housing. As the cost of shelter increases it can have a \u201ccascading effect on extremely low-income renters,\u201d said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n    Research from Aurand\u2019s organization has shown that more than 9.2 million \u201cextremely low-income\u201d renters are cost burdened by their housing, meaning they spent more than a third of their income on shelter-related expenses. Many of these households spend upwards of 50% on housing, leaving little money behind for other purchases.\n  The alternative for these households would be losing the roof over their heads. In recent years, that has become the reality for many Americans. A  2019 study released by the Trump administration estimated that more than 500,000 people sleep outdoors each night across the country, while many more couch surf or utilize shelters for unhoused people.\n  Meanwhile, for people who own their homes, buying a property isn\u2019t the same as buying, say, a banana. Owning that banana won\u2019t benefit you financially in the long-run, whereas with a house you can expect to see its value increase and to profit off that. But a home isn\u2019t a pure investment asset like a stock \u2014 it\u2019s a mix of both.\n    Home prices can rise both because the actual structure itself may be worth more \u2014 thanks to the rising cost of labor and lumber \u2014 but also because people see value in it as a capital investment.\n  As a result, there can be a mismatch in the way economists or government statistician view rising home prices, and what that means to a consumer.\n  \u201cIn a market environment where prices are rising so quickly to buy a home the economist would say that\u2019s the increase in the price of the capital good,\u201d said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \u201cBut to the buyer, it represents a higher cost of living.\u201d\n   People experience inflation vis-\u00e0-vis housing differently to most other products, and that makes it a challenging to measure.\n  For the typical homeowner, their housing costs likely haven\u2019t changed too much over the past year.\n  \u201cIf you have a fixed mortgage, on your home, year over year, how much does your cost of living in that home change? Not very much,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cThe only things that change year over year are your escrows for taxes and insurance.\u201d\n  Even with renters, the price of housing doesn\u2019t shift higher or lower from month to month. That\u2019s why the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects housing data more infrequently than most other items in the CPI basket of goods.\n  For renters and buyers, you encounter the changing cost when something about your living arrangement changed: When you move to a new home, sign a new lease or refinance your mortgage.\n    But Americans do need to know how much housing costs are rising or falling \u2014 not the least of which because residential real-estate makes up such a huge portion of the nation\u2019s economy.\n  The government\u2019s Consumer Price Index calculates the \u201cimputed rent\u201d \u2014 essentially the amount a homeowner is paying for their housing rather than paying a landlord.\n  If it did not do so, GDP would actually fall, Dietz said, \u201cbecause money that would be a rental payment in the marketplace paid by a renter suddenly disappears.\u201d\n  To bridge this challenge, the government relies on survey data to produce its estimates of housing costs for renters and homeowners. In renters\u2019 cases, they are simply asked how much they pay for housing.\n  But owners aren\u2019t asked what their mortgage payment is \u2014 after all, not everyone has a mortgage. Instead, that\u2019s why they are asked to estimate how much they would be able to charge for rent to lease out their current home.\n  Government statisticians survey the same cohort of Americans periodically to produce their findings and track changes over time to estimate housing costs.\n  \u201cInflation and [changes in] housing prices have generally been matched up,\u201d said Jonathan Needell, President and Chief Investment Officer of KIMC, a private real-estate investment company. He added that rising housing prices has \u201cexceeded inflation in some circumstances.\u201d\n  Some researchers have argued, however, that this approach  can also understate and/or be slow to identify true inflation occurring in the housing market.\n  A  new analysis from Fannie Mae  FNMA,  +2.26% showed that there is typically a lag between when home prices are actually rising, and when that price growth is reflected in inflation reports like the consumer price index.\n   The shifts in housing preferences and needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also complicated our ability to gauge the effect of inflation in the housing market.\n  Wealthier Americans, many of whom suddenly found themselves able to work remotely, chose to move away from major cities into larger and cheaper homes in the suburbs, often saving money in the process. As a result, rental rates declined in pricier neighborhoods.\n  But in more affordable areas, rents actually increased. Americans who lost their jobs because of the pandemic rushed to find cheaper housing, pushing rents higher for the least expensive apartments and homes in the suburbs.\n  Those effects are beginning to dissipate, but will continue to weigh on official measures like the consumer price index given the time lags that occur.\n    So is housing quickly becoming more expensive? The answer, economists agree, is yes. First American Financial Services has its own measure, the Real House Price Index, which compares nominal-price gains with Americans\u2019 ability to afford to purchase a property based on the prevailing interest rates and household income.\n  For a period of time between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the  Real House Price Index was falling, because Americans\u2019 buying power was rising faster than home prices, Fleming said. That\u2019s not the case anymore.\n  \u201cDeflation has turned into inflation, not because interest rates have gone up \u2014 they\u2019ve only gone up a little bit \u2014 but because house prices are just crazy,\u201d Fleming said.\n  The reason home prices are rising so fast is fairly simple. After the Great Recession, home-building activity all but drew to a standstill as the construction industry worked to recover.\n    As a result, the construction of new homes did not keep pace with population growth and the formation of new households.\n  That left the housing market with a serious shortage of homes, just as millennials have begun getting married and having kids \u2014 traditional hallmarks of home-buying interest.\n  With the pandemic, the shift to remote working and low interest rates have only exacerbated things.\n  The primary solution to address runaway inflation in housing will be to build more homes \u2014 something that\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cSome of the challenges that we face on the supply side of the residential construction industry are going to persist well into 2022,\u201d Dietz said.\n  Those challenges run the gamut from the high cost of lumber to the lack of skilled workers to complete construction projects. Another factor: Zoning regulations across the country prevent the construction of more dense housing in many cities, effectively driving up home prices and rents in the process.\n  Finally, new-home construction alone won\u2019t make matters easier for all Americans. Because of the high costs, it\u2019s easier for builders to construct more expensive homes, even though the demand and competition is strongest for entry-level properties.\n  Over time, that increased concentration in the bottom-tier of the housing market is driving up prices for those who can least afford it.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s this argument that if you just build more supply to meet the demand, it will eventually help extremely low and very low-income renters,\u201d Aurand said. \u201cBut the market is not going to adequately serve mostly extremely low-income renters.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:45:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u98ce\u66b4,storm,\u4f4f\u623f", "title": "\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u98ce\u66b4\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u6765\u4e34 ", "title_en": "An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-u-s-housing-market-11623419869?mod=mw_more_headlines", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u98ce\u66b4", "storm", "\u4f4f\u623f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066918, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JPEG XL\u56fe\u50cf\u683c\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u6240\u8c13\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\uff0334;\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5176\u90bb\u5c45\u989c\u8272\u7684\u989c\u8272\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u8fbe\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5c0f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u5219110\u8702\u7a9d\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u3002 \uff08\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u4efb\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u60f3\u6211\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219110\u662f\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 - \u9664\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u662f\uff01\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0cJPEG XL\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u50cf1024\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c1024\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002\u6240\u4ee5JPEG XL\u672c\u8eab\u662f\uff06\uff0339; T\u5b8c\u6210;\u6ca1\u67091024\u00d71024\u50cf\u7d20\u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u3002\n   \u8fd9\u662f\u6211JPEG XL\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u5219110\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u3002\u5355\u51fb\u5b83\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\n   \u5f53\u6211\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u5199\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\uff0cJXL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u683c\u5f0f\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\u6216\u5e38\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u8ba9\u5b83\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528sed\u547d\u4ee4sed\uff06\uff0339; s | \\ s *;\u3002* $ ||; s | t 1 | t 255 |; s | -1 | -255 |\uff06\uff0339;\u5265\u53bb\u6ce8\u91ca\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u00b11\u81f3\u00b1255\u3002\n  \u5982\u679cY\uff06gt; 0\u5982\u679cn\uff06gt; 0\u5982\u679cnw-n\uff06gt; -1; n = 1\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; 0; nw = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NW = 1\uff0cNE = 0/1\u5982\u679cnw-n>; 0; n = 0\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; -1; nw = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NE = 1\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; -1; nw = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NE = 1\u5982\u679cx\uff06gt; 1022  -  SET 255  -  SET 0\n  JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u827a\u672f\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728JPEG XL Developer Jon Sneyers\u7684JXL Art Gallery\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u827a\u672f\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728JPEG XL Discord\u4e2d\u7684#JXL-ART\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u827a\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u5e93\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301JPEG XL\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3002\n \u201cJPEG XL\u827a\u672f\uff1a\uff06\uff0339; eeg\u5728Mount sierpinski\uff06\uff0339; 77\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u57fa\u5730\u3002 reddit\u7ebf\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7Jon Sneyers\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u3002 ", "note_en": "The  JPEG XL image format includes so-called &#34;predictors&#34;, small programs that improve compression by expressing the color of a pixel in terms of the colors of its neighbors.

However, the threat most likely affects only the  $2,495 bike used in public spaces, such as in hotels or gyms, because the hacker needs to physically access the screen using a USB drive containing a malicious code.\n According to McAfee&#39;s Advanced Threat Research team, a hacker can discreetly control the stationary bike&#39;s screen remotely and interfere with its operating system. That means hackers could, for example, install apps that look like Netflix or Spotify and steal the users&#39; log-in information. Perhaps more alarmingly, the cybersecurity team was able spy on users via the camera and microphone, which is normally used for video chats with other users.\n      &#34;As a result, an unsuspecting gym-goer taking the Peloton Bike+ for a spin could be in danger of having their personal data compromised and their workout unknowingly watched,&#34; the report said. It also warned the hacker could configure this spyware at any point, including during the supply chain or delivery process, without the owner knowing.\n   Internet-connected devices, whether they are bikes, computers or even refrigerators,  are all susceptible to hacks. Cyberattacks have increasingly caught the public&#39;s attention, with high-profile companies including  McDonald&#39;s, Microsoft and Electronic Arts publicly revealing recent security breaches.\n  McAfee said it pored over Peloton&#39;s software with a &#34;critical eye&#34; to find vulnerabilities and warn users. The two companies worked together to &#34;responsibly develop and issue a patch.&#34;\n Peloton  (  PTON) released a mandatory software update that fixes the issue to users earlier this month. The security risk doesn&#39;t affect the lower-priced Peloton Bike because it uses a different type of touchscreen.\n This is an important reminder for users of all connected devices to activate automatic software updates to keep them protected against the latest attacks, according to McAfee.\n   &#34;Stay on top of software updates from your device manufacturer, especially since they will not always advertise their availability,&#34; McAfee&#39;s researchers said. &#34;Visit their website regularly to ensure you do not miss news that may affect you.&#34;\n This report marks the second security concern for Peloton in two months. In May, the fitness firm released a security update that sealed a leak that was revealing personal account information, such as a user&#39;s age, city and weight.
